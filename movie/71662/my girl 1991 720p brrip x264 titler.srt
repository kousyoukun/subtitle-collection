1
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,700
I was born jaundiced.

2
00:00:57,035 --> 00:01:00,871
Once I sat on a toilet seat at a truck stop
and caught hemorrhoids,

3
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,581
and I've learned to live
with this chicken bone

4
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:05,459
that's been lodged in my throat
for the past three years.

5
00:01:05,544 --> 00:01:09,213
So I knew Dad would be devastated
when he learned of my latest affliction.

6
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,091
Dad, I don't want to upset you,

7
00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:16,053
but my left breast is developing at a
significantly faster rate than my right.

8
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:18,513
It can only mean one thing, cancer.

9
00:01:18,722 --> 00:01:20,181
I'm dying.

10
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:22,767
Okay.

11
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:26,437
Sweetie, hand me
the mayonnaise out of the fridge.

12
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:43,246
All right. Who's in? Raise your hand.

13
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:46,374
Are you coming or not, Thomas J?

14
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:47,542
I don't think so.

15
00:01:47,626 --> 00:01:48,751
I knew he wouldn't come.

16
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,129
I can't. I have to go home.

17
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:53,214
Yeah, to play with his dolls.

18
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,008
Leave him alone.

19
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:57,302
Come on, let's go.

20
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:06,268
Hey! You didn't pay me.

21
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:08,770
How do I know you're gonna show us one?

22
00:02:09,105 --> 00:02:10,439
You're such a baby.

23
00:02:10,982 --> 00:02:12,274
All right.

24
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:14,943
Here.

25
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:18,113
Okay, follow me and don't say a word.

26
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:27,497
You ready?

27
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:41,637
You sure you want to see it?

28
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:43,305
Or is someone going to go yellowbelly?

29
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:44,931
I'm not chicken!

30
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:47,725
Okay. Lean forward.

31
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:53,481
It's empty.

32
00:02:53,565 --> 00:02:54,941
You're so weird.

33
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:57,109
I want my money back.

34
00:02:57,861 --> 00:03:00,821
- I was afraid of this.
- Of what?

35
00:03:00,906 --> 00:03:04,659
Well, sometimes when we get them,
they're not completely dead.

36
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,119
You know, like when they cut
a chicken's head off

37
00:03:07,204 --> 00:03:08,579
and they still run around crazy.

38
00:03:08,664 --> 00:03:10,581
You're full of shit.

39
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:13,668
I bet she's roaming
around this house somewhere.

40
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,008
There she is. In the rocking chair.

41
00:03:30,768 --> 00:03:32,310
Let's get out of here.

42
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:33,687
Quick. Come on.

43
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:36,398
Hurry up.

44
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:46,741
Hi, Gramoo.

45
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:53,123
Vada, would you bring down my cigarettes?

46
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,551
See you later.

47
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:08,805
Did I tell you he was my woodshop teacher?

48
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:10,014
You took woodshop?

49
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:12,099
Yeah, I made a tie rack.

50
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:13,726
I made a tie rack.

51
00:04:16,396 --> 00:04:17,938
- Was it fancy?
- Yeah.

52
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,400
Vada, just put them on the stool.

53
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:27,740
Daddy, guess what?
I beat Thomas J. in Monopoly yesterday.

54
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:30,659
Yeah. Rack holds six ties.

55
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:32,244
I still have mine.

56
00:04:32,454 --> 00:04:33,704
Arthur!

57
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:34,830
Vada!

58
00:04:34,914 --> 00:04:36,790
I beat Thomas J. in Monopoly yesterday.

59
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,334
Good for you, baby.

60
00:04:38,585 --> 00:04:40,794
Once you put the hotels
on Boardwalk and Park Place,

61
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,046
you're a shoo-in to win.

62
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,173
I like to buy up all the railroads.

63
00:04:44,257 --> 00:04:45,591
Vada, we're trying to work here.

64
00:04:58,187 --> 00:05:02,482
Cruella De Vil stole all the puppies.
She was going to make a fur out of them.

65
00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:04,317
Hand me the cannula.

66
00:05:04,609 --> 00:05:08,272
<i>There he was
just-a walkin' down the street</i>

67
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:11,213
<i>Singin' "doo-wah diddy-diddy
dum-diddy-doo"</i>

68
00:05:11,316 --> 00:05:13,977
<i>- Poppin' his fingers
and a-shufflin'... - Vada.</i>

69
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:15,119
Dad?

70
00:05:15,913 --> 00:05:17,705
I'm embalming my high school teacher.

71
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,791
Don't sing.

72
00:05:21,085 --> 00:05:23,961
All right, Arthur.
Just slide him to me a little bit.

73
00:05:24,463 --> 00:05:26,130
That's it. That's good.

74
00:05:30,135 --> 00:05:34,931
Okay. Put him in a nice model c-501.
Bronze, stainless Eternal Journey.

75
00:05:35,724 --> 00:05:37,516
Yeah, he'll look like a champion.

76
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,010
Is Mr. Harry Sultenfuss in?

77
00:06:14,345 --> 00:06:15,846
Sure. Come on in.

78
00:06:28,817 --> 00:06:31,652
So, have you had the unfortunate experience

79
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:33,779
of recently losing a loved one?

80
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,950
Could I see your dad? Just for a second?

81
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,413
Dad, somebody's here!

82
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:48,210
He's downstairs working on Mr. Layton.

83
00:06:48,545 --> 00:06:49,837
Prostate cancer.

84
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:52,423
Once it hits your prostate, you're a goner.

85
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,847
How may I help you?

86
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:01,474
I'm Shelly DeVoto.

87
00:07:02,851 --> 00:07:05,393
We spoke the other day
regarding the makeup artist job?

88
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:06,478
Yes.

89
00:07:06,562 --> 00:07:08,521
It's still available, I hope?

90
00:07:08,606 --> 00:07:09,772
I think it's still available.

91
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:13,276
I'm a licensed cosmetologist.

92
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,988
I worked for two years
at the Dino Raphael salon.

93
00:07:17,364 --> 00:07:19,824
All my customers cried
when I told them I was leaving.

94
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:23,703
- Miss DeVoto...
- I have a wonderful disposition.

95
00:07:23,787 --> 00:07:25,163
I put people right at ease.

96
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:27,916
Miss DeVoto,
these people are already at ease.

97
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:30,710
This is not a beauty parlor.

98
00:07:31,003 --> 00:07:32,712
It's a funeral parlor.

99
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:35,298
They're dead?

100
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:36,758
Yes, they are.

101
00:07:37,218 --> 00:07:38,510
Stiffs?

102
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:40,345
Deceased.

103
00:07:41,096 --> 00:07:43,181
The ad just said makeup artist.

104
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,433
Excuse me a second, will you?

105
00:07:45,935 --> 00:07:47,100
Sure.

106
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:50,437
Hi, George.

107
00:07:50,605 --> 00:07:52,147
This is a 1258.

108
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:54,399
I didn't want the burnished handles.

109
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:57,069
- Is that your camper?
- Yes, it is.

110
00:07:57,153 --> 00:07:58,695
That's really cool.

111
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:02,282
Hello.

112
00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:04,868
She's shy.

113
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,122
Just put it back in
the display room, fellas.

114
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:11,458
Okay, Harry.

115
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,213
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?

116
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:19,466
They come in all sizes,
honey, just like shoes.

117
00:08:19,884 --> 00:08:21,802
Is it for a child?

118
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:23,470
Of course not.

119
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:25,347
Then who's it for?

120
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:27,599
Short people. Very short people.

121
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:29,142
Excuse me.

122
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:31,102
What about the job?

123
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,020
Pardon?

124
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:34,647
I need the job.

125
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:37,233
You still want it, even though...

126
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,735
Sure, it's no big deal.

127
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,406
You see, all my former clients
will eventually die,

128
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,825
and all your clients used to be alive.

129
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:47,868
So they have something in common.

130
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:51,038
You'd be doing hair and makeup
and answering the phone.

131
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,125
Okay, Mr. Sultenfuss.

132
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,043
- You've got a deal.
- Great.

133
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:58,170
- You can start right away.
- Okay.

134
00:08:58,255 --> 00:08:59,589
Call me Harry.

135
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,215
Now...

136
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,927
Is this what
you'd normally wear for work or...

137
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,637
- Look...
- Don't get me wrong.

138
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:08,848
I like it very much, but the...

139
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:11,726
I promise I'll take good
care of these people.

140
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,810
They deserve it.

141
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:15,020
They're dead.

142
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,273
All they've got left is their looks.

143
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,958
Hey, look at this. No feet.

144
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,419
Wow, a real Evel Knievel.

145
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:53,808
What the hell are you doing in my garage?
Get out of here!

146
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:26,131
Hi, Vada, what's wrong today?

147
00:10:26,216 --> 00:10:27,424
I'm very sick.

148
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:31,095
Okay, take a seat.
I'll check if the doctor can see you.

149
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:37,601
Vada's here. She says she's very sick.

150
00:10:38,353 --> 00:10:39,769
She looks all right to me.

151
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:43,564
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. He'll see you.

152
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:45,775
Why don't you go in?

153
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:54,659
Well, what is it? I can handle it.

154
00:10:54,952 --> 00:10:56,661
You are perfectly healthy.

155
00:10:56,912 --> 00:10:59,622
That can't be.
I have all the classic symptoms.

156
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:02,458
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton
to your house today?

157
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:03,543
Yes.

158
00:11:03,627 --> 00:11:07,880
Vada, you've got to stop this.
There's absolutely nothing wrong with you.

159
00:11:16,348 --> 00:11:18,683
I'll just have to get a second opinion.

160
00:11:24,313 --> 00:11:26,606
So what did he say was wrong with you?

161
00:11:27,358 --> 00:11:30,068
The whole medical profession is a crock.

162
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:32,154
Hey, wait up for me.

163
00:11:49,338 --> 00:11:51,339
- Hey, look.
- At what?

164
00:11:51,716 --> 00:11:54,092
That's Mr. Bixler. Let's go talk to him.

165
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:56,261
I don't want to talk to no teacher.
It's summer.

166
00:11:56,345 --> 00:11:57,471
Hi, Mr. Bixler.

167
00:11:58,097 --> 00:12:00,849
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss
and the amazing Dr. J.

168
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:03,268
- How's the summer treating you?
- It's okay.

169
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,896
Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books
for summer reading.

170
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:09,940
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.

171
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:12,526
Yes, and now I'm reading
War and Peace for fun.

172
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:14,945
No wonder you're my prize pupil.

173
00:12:15,447 --> 00:12:18,365
- What about you, Thomas J?
- I haven't started yet.

174
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:20,117
Better get on his case, Vada.

175
00:12:20,202 --> 00:12:22,661
Mr. Bixler, how come
you're painting this old house?

176
00:12:22,996 --> 00:12:25,539
Well, I just bought it.
Now I'm fixing it up.

177
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:29,084
This is one big house for one single person.

178
00:12:30,003 --> 00:12:32,630
Well, you never can tell.

179
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:35,716
I might get a pet.

180
00:12:36,968 --> 00:12:39,136
How are you going to get the money
to pay for this old house

181
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:40,763
if you're not working?

182
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:42,807
Well, I'm going to teach
creative writing this summer.

183
00:12:42,891 --> 00:12:45,267
So, I'm doing some work.

184
00:12:45,811 --> 00:12:48,646
- How much does it cost?
- $35.

185
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,979
What do you get for that?

186
00:12:50,064 --> 00:12:52,899
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry.

187
00:12:53,692 --> 00:12:56,277
- This an interrogation, Vada?
- No.

188
00:12:57,071 --> 00:13:00,073
Well, I guess I'll go home
and finish off War and Peace.

189
00:13:00,282 --> 00:13:03,535
It's summer. You're kids. Go play.

190
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:13,169
Want to go to Gray's orchard
and pick some peaches?

191
00:13:13,254 --> 00:13:16,923
- No, I'm going home.
- Why? It's not dinnertime yet.

192
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:20,677
"Dinnertime"? You're like a dog.
You just go home to eat!

193
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:22,762
Don't pee on the hydrant!

194
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:45,036
<i>Bill</i>

195
00:13:45,114 --> 00:13:50,108
<i>I love you so
I always will</i>

196
00:13:50,186 --> 00:13:53,747
<i>I look at you
and see the passion</i>

197
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:57,122
<i>Eyes of May</i>

198
00:13:57,193 --> 00:14:01,220
<i>Oh, but am I ever
gonna see</i>

199
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:04,698
<i>My wedding day</i>

200
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:08,640
Rupert Gwynn called.
There was a big accident on PA-34.

201
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:10,183
They're bringing in two tomorrow.

202
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:13,103
Excuse me, Harry,
I finished Mr. Layton's hair.

203
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:15,689
He kinda looked...
Harry, what's wrong with her?

204
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:19,275
She's just pretending.
Vada, get up here and eat your broccoli.

205
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,528
I think it's my prostate.

206
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,075
No. How many removals
did you say we were expecting?

207
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,368
Two. I'm gonna have
to do a v-section on one.

208
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:30,578
Can you give me a hand?

209
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,121
Well, I guess so. If you want.

210
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:36,500
Now this isn't gonna be a repeat of that
smelter accident a few years ago, is it?

211
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:39,170
Don't mock that.
That's how we bought the new Cadillac.

212
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:42,089
Yes, I know that.
Except, I had a body in my bedroom,

213
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:46,052
you had a body in your bedroom.
We were littered with peoples' bodies.

214
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,604
- Who's winning?
- I am.

215
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,732
Look. Vada and her little boyfriend.

216
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,776
He is not my boyfriend.

217
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,153
I bet she kisses him on the lips.

218
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,238
Do you think I'd kiss that ugly old thing?

219
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,074
Yeah, anyway.

220
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,326
Come on, let's go.

221
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,456
Judy's father owns the Bijou Theater,
and we get to see all the movies for free.

222
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,292
- Maybe you can come sometime.
- Don't invite her.

223
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,336
She'll have to bring her boyfriend.

224
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,236
<i>Vada and Thomas</i>

225
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,039
<i>Sittin' in a tree</i>

226
00:15:26,112 --> 00:15:29,980
<i>K - I - S - S - I - N - G</i>

227
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:33,917
<i>First comes love
Then comes marriage</i>

228
00:15:33,986 --> 00:15:38,923
<i>Then comes Thomas J.
in the baby carriage</i>

229
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,940
You know, Vada,
you shouldn't let those girls upset you.

230
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,651
I'm not upset.
I will never play with those girls.

231
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:49,655
I only surround myself with people
who I find intellectually stimulating.

232
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:56,912
Want a piece of chocolate?

233
00:15:57,747 --> 00:16:00,207
- Thomas J?
- I'm allergic to it.

234
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,793
- To chocolate?
- He's allergic to everything.

235
00:16:02,877 --> 00:16:03,877
To chocolate?

236
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,838
- To everything.
- To everything.

237
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:12,112
- That's a pretty ring you're wearing.
- It's a mood ring.

238
00:16:12,147 --> 00:16:15,286
- It tells what mood I'm in.
- It doesn't work. It always stays black.

239
00:16:15,616 --> 00:16:19,059
It's only black when you're around
'cause you put me in a bad mood.

240
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,186
Maybe black means you're happy.

241
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,480
I don't think so.

242
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,898
Shelly, how can I get $35?

243
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:28,943
She's crazy.
She wants to go to school over the summer.

244
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,531
It's not a real school.
It's a writing class. I want to be a writer.

245
00:16:33,615 --> 00:16:36,159
She only wants to go
because her sweetie pie's the teacher.

246
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,369
Shut your big fat mouth!

247
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:41,122
I think you'd make a fine writer.

248
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:42,832
Did you ask your dad?

249
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:44,625
He won't give it to me.

250
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,961
Well, you don't know that.

251
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:48,838
Ask him.

252
00:16:50,883 --> 00:16:52,800
Edith, what channel is Cronkite on?

253
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,262
Channel 2, Archie, the one we don't watch

254
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,474
'cause you always say
Walter Cronkite is a communist.

255
00:17:08,484 --> 00:17:10,400
I never said that, Edith.

256
00:17:10,651 --> 00:17:11,860
The man ain't all red.

257
00:17:14,322 --> 00:17:16,573
What's the matter with this?
There ain't nothing coming on.

258
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:18,825
I'll help you fix it, Daddy.

259
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,078
Daddy, can I have $35?

260
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:23,371
That's a lot of money for a little girl.

261
00:17:23,664 --> 00:17:26,792
It's for school. A summer writing class.

262
00:17:27,168 --> 00:17:28,627
Any more soda left?

263
00:17:32,381 --> 00:17:34,508
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.

264
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:37,385
Last month you wanted to play the violin.

265
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:39,846
Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.

266
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:42,349
Dad?

267
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,267
I love this guy.

268
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,521
- Dad?
- What?

269
00:17:49,273 --> 00:17:50,607
The money?

270
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:52,983
Well, maybe next summer.

271
00:17:55,403 --> 00:17:58,239
He forgot about the time
I wanted to be a magician.

272
00:17:58,323 --> 00:18:00,825
I was really great at
making myself disappear.

273
00:18:07,415 --> 00:18:10,459
- Want to play?
- No. I got to go to the cemetery.

274
00:18:10,544 --> 00:18:12,211
Keep your head up.

275
00:18:13,296 --> 00:18:15,881
Don't look at the ball. Look at me.

276
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:20,052
See? You were looking at the ball.

277
00:18:20,554 --> 00:18:22,471
All right? Keep your head up.

278
00:18:22,556 --> 00:18:23,931
Give me some skin.

279
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:25,808
All right.

280
00:19:21,654 --> 00:19:24,865
Please! Open the door!
Please, someone, open the door!

281
00:19:25,116 --> 00:19:28,285
Please! Please! Open the door!

282
00:19:30,215 --> 00:19:32,513
<i>There he was just-a walkin'

285
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:40,137
Vada?

286
00:19:40,673 --> 00:19:41,965
What happened?

287
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:45,761
My ball. I lost my ball.

288
00:19:47,138 --> 00:19:48,472
Come on, sweetie.

289
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,521
Excuse me, Harry?

290
00:19:58,566 --> 00:20:01,401
- Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
- Yeah.

291
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,452
Didn't I give you a picture
of what she looked like?

292
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:13,454
Yeah.

293
00:20:19,461 --> 00:20:20,670
You don't like it?

294
00:20:21,505 --> 00:20:23,506
This was the Reverend Porter's wife.

295
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,217
You have her looking
like a two-dollar hooker.

296
00:20:26,385 --> 00:20:28,302
I think she looks nice.

297
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,096
Her lips are very thin

298
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,432
so I used the gloss to give
them a more sensual quality

299
00:20:33,642 --> 00:20:37,019
and her eyes just needed
a little definition,

300
00:20:37,646 --> 00:20:38,896
and her hair... I'm sorry.

301
00:20:38,981 --> 00:20:42,483
- Nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
- She did.

302
00:20:42,693 --> 00:20:45,444
This photo was taken a month ago
at the church food drive.

303
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:48,613
I just wanted to get past
this old schoolmarm image.

304
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:50,907
That wasn't an image.

305
00:20:50,992 --> 00:20:53,034
She was an old schoolmarm.

306
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:54,828
Fix it.

307
00:20:57,873 --> 00:20:59,124
Harry.

308
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:05,755
I was just wondering

309
00:21:06,215 --> 00:21:08,133
if there is anything wrong with Vada.

310
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:09,551
What do you mean?

311
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,053
- Well, the other night at dinner...
- That. She just likes to play.

312
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,763
I don't think so.

313
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:17,225
I think she's confused about death.

314
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,603
She was raised in a funeral home.
She knows a thing or two about it.

315
00:21:20,688 --> 00:21:24,816
- But Harry, I really think...
- She's a perfectly happy 11-year-old girl.

316
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,944
Look, don't give me any advice
about my daughter. Okay?

320
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,404
<i>This is what they told me
And this is what they said</i>

321
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,607
<i>Patty-cake, patty- cake
Turn around</i>

322
00:21:47,672 --> 00:21:49,089
There's Shelly.

323
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:53,010
Hi.

324
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:55,471
Can we look around in your camper?

325
00:21:55,972 --> 00:21:57,014
Sure.

326
00:21:57,098 --> 00:22:00,434
I'll give you the royal tour. Whoa. Gosh.

327
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,737
Wow! This is the coolest thing.

328
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:14,614
And you can really eat and sleep here?

329
00:22:16,617 --> 00:22:18,409
I'm going to drive us to Liverpool.

330
00:22:18,494 --> 00:22:19,494
"Liverpool"?

331
00:22:19,787 --> 00:22:21,120
Big Ringo fan.

332
00:22:21,288 --> 00:22:22,663
Right.

333
00:22:23,123 --> 00:22:25,041
- Would you like a soda?
- I would.

334
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,626
- Thomas?
- Yes, please.

335
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:33,674
What are you reading?

336
00:22:37,596 --> 00:22:40,139
You shouldn't be looking at that.
It's a little too old for you.

337
00:22:40,682 --> 00:22:42,350
Did you read all these books?

338
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,185
What are they about?

339
00:22:45,396 --> 00:22:47,939
Mostly love and romance.

340
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:50,983
Gross.

341
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:52,819
They're just fun to read.

342
00:22:54,154 --> 00:22:55,779
Here. Cheers.

343
00:23:00,326 --> 00:23:01,701
Are you married?

344
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:03,995
No. I'm divorced.

345
00:23:04,455 --> 00:23:06,540
Daddy said it's bad
when people get divorced.

346
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:09,126
I know.
Sometimes married people just find out

347
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,669
they can't live with each other.

348
00:23:10,878 --> 00:23:12,379
The Meyers are divorced.

349
00:23:14,632 --> 00:23:16,466
Shelly, can I have a cookie?

350
00:23:19,053 --> 00:23:20,679
Hey, where are all the cookies?

351
00:23:22,014 --> 00:23:24,683
Well, I guess you found
my secret hiding place.

352
00:23:25,852 --> 00:23:27,352
What are you saving for?

353
00:23:28,187 --> 00:23:29,604
Nothing in particular.

354
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:32,065
Just putting it away for a rainy day.

355
00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:37,070
I'm supposed to be home at noon for lunch.

356
00:23:37,155 --> 00:23:38,488
Thanks, Shelly.

357
00:23:40,323 --> 00:23:41,365
Bye.

358
00:23:43,452 --> 00:23:45,995
Well, Miss Vada,
what do you say we head back?

359
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:48,247
- Can I use your bathroom first?
- Sure.

360
00:23:48,331 --> 00:23:49,457
You don't have to wait.

361
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:51,292
Daddy will be mad if you're late.

362
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,877
Okay.

363
00:24:02,596 --> 00:24:07,057
"The great way is not difficult
for those with no preferences.

364
00:24:07,642 --> 00:24:10,352
"With the absence of both love and hate,

365
00:24:10,437 --> 00:24:14,231
"everything becomes clear
and undisguised. "

366
00:24:16,109 --> 00:24:18,652
That was written by a Chinese philosopher
in the year 600.

367
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:22,447
Now, why would I choose to bring that up
in a creative writing class?

368
00:24:24,617 --> 00:24:28,536
Because the absence of judgment
helps us to appreciate reality.

369
00:24:29,788 --> 00:24:31,080
In other words,

370
00:24:31,332 --> 00:24:33,917
I want you to listen
to your classmates' writing

371
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:36,294
with a clear and open heart.

372
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:38,671
Okay?

373
00:24:39,757 --> 00:24:41,341
So, who's going to go first?

374
00:24:41,842 --> 00:24:42,967
I got one.

375
00:24:43,469 --> 00:24:44,594
Yeah.

376
00:24:48,641 --> 00:24:50,642
"I sang a song for you to hear

377
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:53,937
"I painted a picture for you to see

378
00:24:54,021 --> 00:24:56,439
"I picked a rose for you to smell

379
00:24:56,524 --> 00:24:59,275
"I planted grass for you to touch

380
00:24:59,735 --> 00:25:01,903
"But you did not hear my song

381
00:25:01,987 --> 00:25:04,030
"You did not see my picture

382
00:25:04,114 --> 00:25:05,614
"You did not smell my rose

383
00:25:05,698 --> 00:25:07,783
"And you did not touch my grass. "

384
00:25:08,701 --> 00:25:10,702
Maybe she was out of town.

385
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,246
That's not funny.

386
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,498
His poem is about futility.

387
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:18,585
We toil in unrewarded obscurity.

388
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:20,087
Now, I hear judgment.

389
00:25:20,171 --> 00:25:22,506
Let's not forget the part
about the open heart.

390
00:25:22,715 --> 00:25:26,510
Vada, is there something I can do for you?

391
00:25:27,178 --> 00:25:28,554
I paid the money.

392
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:30,806
For this class?

393
00:25:32,976 --> 00:25:34,226
I want to be a writer.

394
00:25:36,145 --> 00:25:37,980
But Vada, this is a...

395
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:40,857
This is an adult writing class.

396
00:25:40,942 --> 00:25:43,569
Hey, I think it's real beautiful.

397
00:25:43,653 --> 00:25:45,279
She wants to be a writer.

398
00:25:45,613 --> 00:25:47,990
More power to you, little sister.

399
00:25:48,491 --> 00:25:50,783
Vada, you sure you want to do this?

400
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:57,248
Okay. Welcome to the class. Go find a seat.

401
00:26:03,672 --> 00:26:05,548
Okay. Who's next?

402
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:08,509
I experienced something
with my boyfriend the other day

403
00:26:08,594 --> 00:26:10,511
and I wrote a few words down.

404
00:26:11,013 --> 00:26:12,930
Floor's yours, Ronda.

405
00:26:16,518 --> 00:26:19,103
"He covers me like a blanket

406
00:26:19,187 --> 00:26:22,023
"From the cold, dark night

407
00:26:23,066 --> 00:26:26,652
"As I look into his eyes, I know it's right

408
00:26:27,946 --> 00:26:30,573
"To touch, to feel

409
00:26:31,408 --> 00:26:32,657
"I know he's real

410
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:36,911
"Flesh, all a mesh

411
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:39,623
"Flesh, all a mesh

412
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:42,584
"I can't fight it

413
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:44,794
"There's no point

414
00:26:45,713 --> 00:26:48,798
"I wake up and light a joint"

415
00:26:59,894 --> 00:27:01,144
Vada.

416
00:27:02,104 --> 00:27:03,813
I wrote a poem, too.

417
00:27:03,898 --> 00:27:05,190
Please.

418
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:10,236
Ode to Ice Cream by Vada Sultenfuss.

419
00:27:10,571 --> 00:27:11,988
"I like ice cream a whole lot

420
00:27:12,073 --> 00:27:13,823
"It tastes good when days are hot

421
00:27:13,908 --> 00:27:17,076
"On a cone or in a dish
This would be my only wish

422
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:21,205
"Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road
Even with pie a la mode. "

423
00:27:21,915 --> 00:27:23,874
That's all I got so far.

424
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:25,834
I hear that, Vada.

425
00:27:26,002 --> 00:27:30,756
"Flesh all a mesh"
or "rocky road," it's about desire.

426
00:27:31,758 --> 00:27:33,884
Vada, that's... It's very sweet

427
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:36,762
and it rhymes and that's also good,

428
00:27:39,349 --> 00:27:42,434
but you're not expressing to me
what's in your soul.

429
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,521
I want you to show me
how you see the world,

430
00:27:45,605 --> 00:27:48,357
your fears, your desires,

431
00:27:49,442 --> 00:27:51,360
your innermost secrets.

432
00:27:51,653 --> 00:27:53,445
My fears and secrets:

433
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,948
I'm afraid I killed my mother.

434
00:28:30,474 --> 00:28:32,806
<i>Cannot do without</i>

435
00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:35,935
<i>Harry's wild about me</i>

436
00:28:37,156 --> 00:28:38,906
Excuse me, Harry. I'm sorry.

437
00:28:38,991 --> 00:28:41,409
I just want to let you know
the flowers were delivered

438
00:28:41,493 --> 00:28:43,243
and the room's all set up.

439
00:28:43,536 --> 00:28:44,536
Thanks.

440
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,623
Listen, I want to apologize
for the other day downstairs about Vada.

441
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:50,083
I was a little harsh.

442
00:28:50,168 --> 00:28:53,128
I shouldn't stick my nose
in other people's business.

443
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:55,464
It's just that I like Vada very much.

444
00:28:56,758 --> 00:29:00,677
After my wife died, Gramoo moved in here
to help us take care of Vada.

445
00:29:02,597 --> 00:29:04,306
They were very close.

446
00:29:05,016 --> 00:29:07,851
But lately, as her mind's
been wandering more and more,

447
00:29:07,935 --> 00:29:09,770
Vada's been acting kind of crazy.

448
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:13,315
I'm sure she'll snap out of it, though.

449
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,318
I'm sure she will.

450
00:29:19,572 --> 00:29:21,990
Nothing's biting today.

451
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:23,700
Maybe they had a big breakfast.

452
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:27,536
I'm going to be an acrobat when I grow up.

453
00:29:27,621 --> 00:29:30,664
Big deal. I can do that, too.
Thomas J., you got something.

454
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:32,374
No!

455
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,002
Hurry.

456
00:29:35,962 --> 00:29:37,171
I'm trying.

457
00:29:37,547 --> 00:29:39,048
Reel it in.

458
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,727
It's only a sunny. Throw it back.

459
00:29:52,562 --> 00:29:54,230
I don't like touching fish.

460
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:56,857
I'm gonna pull the hook out
without having to touch it.

461
00:29:56,983 --> 00:29:58,442
You're hurting him. Don't kill him.

462
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,534
Darn hook.

463
00:30:07,202 --> 00:30:08,743
I'm bleeding. Did he get away?

464
00:30:09,203 --> 00:30:10,411
Go look.

465
00:30:13,123 --> 00:30:15,416
Yeah, he got away. Come on, let's go.

466
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,502
We can become blood brothers.

467
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,504
No, I don't want to.

468
00:30:19,588 --> 00:30:22,924
- You could pick that scab on your arm.
- It's a mosquito bite.

469
00:30:23,676 --> 00:30:24,843
It will bleed.

470
00:30:24,927 --> 00:30:26,427
If I do it, can we go?

471
00:30:27,763 --> 00:30:28,888
Okay.

472
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:34,602
Okay, rub them together.

473
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:41,442
Now we're blood brothers for life.

474
00:30:55,623 --> 00:30:56,665
Hi.

475
00:30:58,376 --> 00:31:00,377
Hi. What can I do for you?

476
00:31:01,296 --> 00:31:02,588
Nothing.

477
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:04,381
I was just wondering what you were doing.

478
00:31:04,465 --> 00:31:06,425
I'm just typing up a funeral notice.

479
00:31:06,634 --> 00:31:09,219
You know, when someone dies
we put one in the paper, usually.

480
00:31:09,304 --> 00:31:11,722
It's a service we provide for the family.

481
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,141
Right, right.

482
00:31:17,478 --> 00:31:19,062
"Bader, Lorenzo.

483
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:21,607
"Died June 22, 1972.

484
00:31:22,442 --> 00:31:24,651
"Devoted husband to Nicolette.

485
00:31:25,153 --> 00:31:28,572
"Cherished father of Fabrizio and Heidi.

486
00:31:29,198 --> 00:31:33,118
"In lieu of flowers please send
donations to the Holy Name Society. "

487
00:31:33,995 --> 00:31:35,494
I wrote that.

488
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,705
No kidding?

489
00:31:38,206 --> 00:31:41,667
It's good, "in lieu of. "
I love that word "lieu. "

490
00:31:41,752 --> 00:31:45,212
I prefer it to "instead. "
It has more dignity.

491
00:31:45,672 --> 00:31:47,757
"In lieu," "instead"...

492
00:31:48,175 --> 00:31:49,175
No contest.

493
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,093
It's no big deal.

494
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,347
Harry, you have to learn
how to take a compliment.

495
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:57,516
Movies, movies...

496
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,312
Love Story at the drive-in.

497
00:32:01,396 --> 00:32:04,023
I cried my eyes out. Did you see it?

498
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,193
I haven't been to the movies in ages.

499
00:32:07,486 --> 00:32:09,028
I love to see movies.

500
00:32:09,446 --> 00:32:11,113
Especially at the drive-in.

501
00:32:11,198 --> 00:32:14,659
I don't think there's anything more romantic
than going to the drive-in.

502
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:20,538
I'll let you get back to work.

503
00:32:27,254 --> 00:32:28,880
I do enjoy playing bingo.

504
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:31,341
If you'd like to join me for a game
tomorrow night at church,

505
00:32:31,425 --> 00:32:32,801
you're welcome to.

506
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:36,513
Okay.

507
00:32:46,691 --> 00:32:47,941
Hi, Vada.

508
00:32:51,654 --> 00:32:53,029
Are you going out somewhere?

509
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:54,656
Nope.

510
00:32:54,824 --> 00:32:56,324
So how come you're putting lipstick on?

511
00:32:56,784 --> 00:32:58,743
A girl's always got to look her best.

512
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:00,745
I think lipstick looks fake.

513
00:33:01,455 --> 00:33:03,372
No one's lips are that color.

514
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,791
- Have you ever tried any?
- No.

515
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,085
Come here. Sit down.

516
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:22,307
Go like this. A little less.

517
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:24,393
Okay.

518
00:33:27,188 --> 00:33:28,480
All right.

519
00:33:28,565 --> 00:33:30,816
Now, first, we blot.

520
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:39,616
Take a look.

521
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,618
I think it looks real nice on you.

522
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,621
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?

523
00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:47,749
Yes, Vada, I think you're very pretty.

524
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:52,295
You've got these great, big sparkling eyes

525
00:33:52,838 --> 00:33:54,714
the cutest little nose,

526
00:33:55,174 --> 00:33:56,466
an amazing mouth.

527
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,386
The boys at school don't think I am.

528
00:34:01,013 --> 00:34:02,180
They'll come around.

529
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:04,015
Close your eyes.

530
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:07,351
I want to bring out
the gorgeous color in them.

531
00:34:08,437 --> 00:34:12,273
Now, the first rule in applying eye makeup

532
00:34:12,357 --> 00:34:14,942
is you can never wear
enough blue eye shadow.

533
00:34:16,028 --> 00:34:18,196
Do you like putting makeup on people?

534
00:34:20,115 --> 00:34:21,908
I've been trying to get out
to Hollywood for years

535
00:34:21,992 --> 00:34:24,160
to do makeup for all the movie stars,

536
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:27,371
but I haven't gotten there yet.

537
00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:33,710
All right. Open your eyes.

538
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:42,511
Shelly, I would definitely hold off
on that Hollywood thing.

539
00:34:57,193 --> 00:34:59,277
- Your lip bleeding?
- No!

540
00:34:59,695 --> 00:35:01,113
What's wrong with your eyes?

541
00:35:01,197 --> 00:35:03,448
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.

542
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:05,158
Where's your bike?

543
00:35:05,243 --> 00:35:06,910
In the garage.

544
00:35:07,537 --> 00:35:09,037
Walk me over.

545
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:15,876
It's only a garage. Come on.

546
00:35:17,963 --> 00:35:20,005
Hey, one of my streamers is gone.

547
00:35:20,632 --> 00:35:22,675
Probably fell off in here.

548
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:26,971
Hey, look at this.

549
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:28,931
That was Gramoo's.

550
00:35:29,224 --> 00:35:31,058
It's a phrenology chart.

551
00:35:31,143 --> 00:35:32,434
They used to study the bumps on your head

552
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:35,396
to see if you had a good personality or not.

553
00:35:35,897 --> 00:35:38,274
Come here, I'll diagnose your head.

554
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:39,483
I don't want to.

555
00:35:39,568 --> 00:35:41,152
Come on, it's fun.

556
00:35:50,495 --> 00:35:52,997
- Interesting.
- What?

557
00:35:53,081 --> 00:35:56,166
- You have no personality.
- Hey, where does it say that?

558
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,458
Never mind.

559
00:36:00,129 --> 00:36:02,255
Is that your dad?

560
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,590
Yes.

561
00:36:04,425 --> 00:36:06,426
Who's that with your dad?

562
00:36:12,183 --> 00:36:13,933
That's my mother.

563
00:36:14,518 --> 00:36:16,936
- Do you remember her?
- No.

564
00:36:17,646 --> 00:36:19,314
Gramoo said she's in heaven.

565
00:36:19,899 --> 00:36:22,192
- What do you think it's like?
- What?

566
00:36:22,276 --> 00:36:23,359
Heaven.

567
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:25,820
I think...

568
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,407
Everybody gets their own white horse

569
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:33,077
and all they do is ride them
and eat marshmallows all day.

570
00:36:33,787 --> 00:36:36,289
And everybody's best friends
with everybody else,

571
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:39,249
and when you play sports

572
00:36:39,334 --> 00:36:42,294
there's no teams,
so nobody gets picked last.

573
00:36:42,962 --> 00:36:45,297
But what if you're afraid to ride horses?

574
00:36:45,924 --> 00:36:49,384
It doesn't matter
'cause they're not regular horses.

575
00:36:49,928 --> 00:36:51,470
They got wings.

576
00:36:52,555 --> 00:36:54,890
And it's no big deal if you fall,

577
00:36:55,266 --> 00:36:57,601
'cause you just land in a cloud.

578
00:36:58,019 --> 00:36:59,770
That doesn't sound so bad.

579
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:03,482
Come on. We'll never find that streamer.

580
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:22,708
Well, well, well. What's going on in here?

581
00:37:22,793 --> 00:37:23,834
Nothing.

582
00:37:24,294 --> 00:37:25,753
I'm dressing.

583
00:37:25,837 --> 00:37:28,172
You're dressing.

584
00:37:28,799 --> 00:37:30,675
Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry.

585
00:37:30,759 --> 00:37:33,511
Don't you know it's not nice
to lie to your big brother?

586
00:37:34,972 --> 00:37:36,639
Hey, watch the hair!

587
00:37:36,723 --> 00:37:37,974
- The shirt!
- Give!

588
00:37:38,058 --> 00:37:39,183
All right!

589
00:37:41,603 --> 00:37:45,690
- I'm going out with Shelly.
- Yes! Yes. That's great.

590
00:37:45,774 --> 00:37:47,233
That's great.

591
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,695
- I'm very nervous.
- Why?

592
00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:54,615
- The last date I had was 20 years ago.
- That's true.

593
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,326
Harry. Harry. Sit down.

594
00:37:59,663 --> 00:38:01,831
Let me fill you in on today's women.

595
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:05,250
Since the last time you dated,
something happened.

596
00:38:05,543 --> 00:38:07,043
The sexual revolution.

597
00:38:08,045 --> 00:38:10,964
Now, before that you used
to have to hold a door open for a woman,

598
00:38:11,048 --> 00:38:15,051
pull her chair out, pick up the check.
No more, no more.

599
00:38:15,136 --> 00:38:16,803
You want to know what else is missing?

600
00:38:16,887 --> 00:38:18,138
Bras.

601
00:38:18,889 --> 00:38:21,933
- Come on.
- Harry, I'm serious.

602
00:38:22,476 --> 00:38:25,979
Trust me, Harry.
This woman's lib thing is in.

603
00:38:26,397 --> 00:38:28,732
You got to treat her like
every Tom, Dick and Harry.

604
00:38:28,816 --> 00:38:30,317
Are you sure about all this?

605
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:33,236
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer, huh?

606
00:38:33,821 --> 00:38:35,613
I'm running late.

607
00:38:37,575 --> 00:38:38,616
Shelly will be here any minute.

608
00:38:38,701 --> 00:38:41,536
She's picking you up.
Good, you're on the right track.

609
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:45,790
No, she's just driving over here.
Then we're taking my car.

610
00:38:47,752 --> 00:38:48,792
How do I look?

611
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:51,628
Like a Sultenfuss.

612
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:55,674
Go get her.

613
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,929
- Night, Vada.
- Dad...

614
00:39:01,931 --> 00:39:04,141
Why are you dressed up to play bingo?

615
00:39:04,601 --> 00:39:06,101
I just want to look nice.

616
00:39:06,436 --> 00:39:07,936
You never cared before.

617
00:39:08,772 --> 00:39:10,939
Well, Shelly's coming over.
We're going to go together.

618
00:39:11,441 --> 00:39:14,068
- Why?
- She likes to play bingo.

619
00:39:14,527 --> 00:39:15,736
Can I go, too?

620
00:39:16,446 --> 00:39:19,656
No, I think you better stay here
and keep Gramoo company.

621
00:39:55,734 --> 00:39:58,903
Kitty, looks like your
hunch really paid off.

622
00:39:58,987 --> 00:40:00,279
Yeah, well, I'm glad.

623
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,866
Though I got to admit
I'd just as soon not have

624
00:40:03,951 --> 00:40:06,285
any more bounty prisoners
coming through Dodge

625
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,620
anytime soon.

626
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:09,247
It's a bit wearing on the nerves.

627
00:40:09,331 --> 00:40:14,252
You know, this day was starting off just
fine and I'm going to keep it that way.

628
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,837
Doc, you never answered my question.

629
00:40:18,673 --> 00:40:20,382
Talk about wearing on the nerves...

630
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:23,176
Vada?

631
00:40:24,846 --> 00:40:28,223
- Vada, where are you?
- Here.

632
00:40:28,307 --> 00:40:29,808
Don't do that!

633
00:40:30,351 --> 00:40:31,518
Sorry.

634
00:40:31,894 --> 00:40:32,894
What do you want?

635
00:40:32,979 --> 00:40:36,106
My mom will skin me alive
if she finds out I'm out here.

636
00:40:36,774 --> 00:40:39,025
Let's go to the church.
They're playing bingo tonight.

637
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,027
I told you, I'd get in trouble.

638
00:40:41,112 --> 00:40:43,321
- Pacifist!
- Am not.

639
00:40:43,906 --> 00:40:46,575
- Bed-wetter.
- I stopped that.

640
00:40:48,953 --> 00:40:51,079
"N-38. "

641
00:40:51,164 --> 00:40:52,956
Under the "N," three, eight.

642
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,749
Don't laugh, here's a strategy to bingo.

643
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:58,878
For instance, on a given night
anybody can win, but I play the odds.

644
00:40:58,962 --> 00:41:02,173
When choosing bingo cards,
I use a range of theories

645
00:41:02,257 --> 00:41:05,342
from the laws of probability
to avoiding duplicate number systems.

646
00:41:05,427 --> 00:41:07,052
This way you get much more activity.

647
00:41:07,637 --> 00:41:09,555
Does it make it easier to win?

648
00:41:09,848 --> 00:41:13,184
No, just more activity.

649
00:41:13,268 --> 00:41:15,102
"I-17. "

650
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,521
Under the "I," one, seven.

651
00:41:17,606 --> 00:41:19,023
Hi, Carl. Vern.

652
00:41:19,774 --> 00:41:22,401
They're not going to let us in, Vada.
We're kids.

653
00:41:22,736 --> 00:41:25,571
We're not going to bet.
We're just going to watch.

654
00:41:25,655 --> 00:41:28,324
Watch bingo?
I don't even like to play bingo.

655
00:41:28,408 --> 00:41:29,492
Duck.

656
00:41:31,661 --> 00:41:33,704
"N-4-2. "

657
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:36,957
Under the "N", four, two.

658
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:38,334
Great!

659
00:41:38,418 --> 00:41:42,545
- There's your dad and Shelly.
- I don't want them to see me.

660
00:41:43,172 --> 00:41:44,672
3-7.

661
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:50,970
"B-4. "

662
00:41:51,055 --> 00:41:53,056
Under the "B," four.

663
00:41:57,061 --> 00:41:59,187
"O-69. "

664
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:01,898
Under the "O," six, nine.

665
00:42:01,982 --> 00:42:05,193
- I just had a terrible thought, Harry.
- What's that?

666
00:42:05,277 --> 00:42:09,155
I'm going to be putting makeup
on some of these people very soon.

667
00:42:10,324 --> 00:42:12,659
Why do you think these seats were empty?

668
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,456
"B-6. " Under the "B", six.

669
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:20,792
- Can we go yet?
- Go.

670
00:42:21,377 --> 00:42:24,419
You know I'm not allowed out
by myself after dark.

671
00:42:27,757 --> 00:42:31,468
- I'm just not lucky, Harry.
- It's not always luck.

672
00:42:31,553 --> 00:42:33,136
I mean, depending upon the placement
of the numbers

673
00:42:33,221 --> 00:42:36,139
a guy with ten cards can win as easily
as a guy with 100.

674
00:42:36,933 --> 00:42:38,267
Kind of like men.

675
00:42:39,143 --> 00:42:40,727
How do you mean?

676
00:42:41,771 --> 00:42:44,106
You can be in a room with 100 men

677
00:42:44,566 --> 00:42:46,525
and not like any of them.

678
00:42:47,443 --> 00:42:49,820
Or you can be in a room with just one man,

679
00:42:51,072 --> 00:42:53,031
and he's exactly the one you want.

680
00:42:54,742 --> 00:42:58,287
"B-1. " Under the B, one.

681
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:03,500
Bingo!

682
00:43:05,044 --> 00:43:06,378
We have a winner.

683
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:09,005
Will the winner please raise their hand?

684
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:12,174
There was no bingo. It came from outside.

685
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:17,221
- How could someone outside get a bingo?
- Someone outside didn't get a bingo.

686
00:43:17,848 --> 00:43:21,267
Someone outside yelled "bingo," you moron.

687
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:24,103
- Who you calling a moron?
- Put a lid on it, Vern.

688
00:43:24,187 --> 00:43:25,187
Put a lid on it?

689
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:28,858
If you weren't 200 years old,
I'd kick your wrinkled ass!

690
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:31,736
It's just a bingo game.

691
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,820
We can go now.

692
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:28,750
I had a good time tonight.

693
00:44:29,335 --> 00:44:31,920
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.

694
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,300
Would you like to come in
and see my house?

695
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,177
Just for a minute.

696
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:42,429
Okay, sure.

697
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:58,278
- Home sweet home.
- It's nice.

698
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:00,614
I did it myself.

699
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:04,326
I read a magazine article
about how to maximize small spaces.

700
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:07,287
It certainly looks bigger than it seems.

701
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:13,877
You can look in the bathroom, if you want.
People are always curious about that.

702
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:15,421
Like what happens when you flush?

703
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,142
Yeah.

704
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:31,978
Are you mad at me?

705
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:34,814
No, why?

706
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,901
I don't know.
Tonight you just seemed a little cool.

707
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,154
Not opening car doors and...

708
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,406
That was Phil,

709
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,908
trying to give me advice
on dating '70s women.

710
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,995
Look, I'm so out of touch.
I haven't dated a woman in ages.

711
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,539
Not since my wife died.

712
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,541
What happened to her?

713
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,213
Complications during childbirth.

714
00:46:00,882 --> 00:46:02,966
She died two days after Vada was born.

715
00:46:05,386 --> 00:46:06,678
Did she ever see Vada?

716
00:46:10,016 --> 00:46:13,268
I brought the baby into the room
a couple of times.

717
00:46:14,437 --> 00:46:16,021
She opened her eyes.

718
00:46:17,064 --> 00:46:19,858
Yeah. Yeah, I think she saw Vada.

719
00:46:23,029 --> 00:46:24,321
It was...

720
00:46:26,157 --> 00:46:27,741
Well, did I ruin this?

721
00:46:31,871 --> 00:46:33,079
Dance with me.

722
00:46:33,831 --> 00:46:34,915
Here?

723
00:46:38,294 --> 00:46:40,086
This is where we are.

724
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:43,381
Is there enough room?

725
00:46:48,428 --> 00:46:50,221
- I haven't danced...
- In ages.

726
00:46:50,305 --> 00:46:51,847
I know. Me neither.

727
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:02,983
Bra?

728
00:47:04,945 --> 00:47:07,738
See? You're not that out of touch.

729
00:47:08,782 --> 00:47:10,282
Phil, he's...

730
00:47:13,078 --> 00:47:14,578
You're good.

731
00:47:15,997 --> 00:47:18,999
At Whitman High,
I was considered a pretty hot date.

732
00:47:19,084 --> 00:47:20,584
I did a killer frug.

733
00:47:27,299 --> 00:47:28,925
What are you wearing?

734
00:47:29,426 --> 00:47:30,760
Old Spice.

735
00:47:31,095 --> 00:47:33,471
Phil says it's a timeless classic.

736
00:47:50,614 --> 00:47:53,783
- So, do you want to?
- "Want to" what?

737
00:47:54,785 --> 00:47:56,035
Kiss me.

738
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,745
- Yes.
- Good.

739
00:48:10,301 --> 00:48:12,509
Good at kissing and dancing.

740
00:48:13,303 --> 00:48:15,095
I'm very optimistic.

741
00:48:23,897 --> 00:48:25,397
I'd better go.

742
00:48:26,816 --> 00:48:28,609
It's only a clock.

743
00:48:29,861 --> 00:48:31,528
Good night, Shelly.

744
00:48:32,322 --> 00:48:33,614
Good night.

745
00:48:38,453 --> 00:48:42,331
Well, I guess it's official. We had a date.

746
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:44,625
Maybe we can play bingo again sometime.

747
00:48:45,251 --> 00:48:47,002
I'm tired of bingo.

748
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:50,005
Maybe we should try that drive-in of yours.

749
00:48:52,675 --> 00:48:54,050
Good night.

750
00:49:15,238 --> 00:49:16,948
Before the class started,

751
00:49:17,032 --> 00:49:21,285
Ronda and Justin wanted to lead the class
in a group meditation.

752
00:49:21,787 --> 00:49:23,704
That's really cool.

753
00:49:24,456 --> 00:49:29,085
Okay, what we're going to do
is send our vibes out into the group.

754
00:49:33,465 --> 00:49:36,717
Everybody hold hands and close your eyes.

755
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:42,555
Relax your muscles and take deep breaths.

756
00:49:46,143 --> 00:49:50,814
Now, try to feel
what the other person is feeling

757
00:49:50,898 --> 00:49:52,983
without speaking any words.

758
00:49:54,276 --> 00:49:55,944
Send out your vibe

759
00:49:56,404 --> 00:49:59,572
and receive the vibes
around you at the same time.

760
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,283
Can you feel it?

761
00:50:03,577 --> 00:50:06,079
Okay, open your eyes.

762
00:50:07,123 --> 00:50:08,748
What did everybody feel?

763
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,210
I felt Mrs. Hunsaker's strength.

764
00:50:12,294 --> 00:50:15,213
I can feel that Ronda is one with the earth.

765
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:17,549
She's so cosmically in tune.

766
00:50:17,883 --> 00:50:21,969
So right on. That's exactly what I sent out,

767
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:26,140
and I felt like you were full
of inner peace and harmony.

768
00:50:28,351 --> 00:50:30,436
Vada, what did you feel?

769
00:50:31,688 --> 00:50:33,564
I felt Justin's hangnail.

770
00:50:33,648 --> 00:50:36,817
No, Vada. That's not what we're looking for.

771
00:50:36,943 --> 00:50:39,778
A hangnail is insignificant.

772
00:50:40,697 --> 00:50:42,364
What's in my soul?

773
00:50:43,116 --> 00:50:45,117
Feel my aura.

774
00:50:45,785 --> 00:50:47,703
I don't think I'm allowed to.

775
00:50:48,955 --> 00:50:52,041
Tell you what. Let's try it again.

776
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:54,001
Hold hands.

777
00:50:56,838 --> 00:50:59,465
Gramoo once had a hangnail on her big toe.

778
00:50:59,549 --> 00:51:02,092
It got infected and traveled
to her vocal cords.

779
00:51:02,302 --> 00:51:03,926
Ruined her singing voice.

780
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:06,304
I don't think Gramoo thought
it was insignificant.

781
00:52:05,071 --> 00:52:06,696
And some lettuce.

782
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:11,201
Watch out for the rust when you get lettuce.

783
00:52:12,036 --> 00:52:13,078
Hey!

784
00:52:14,413 --> 00:52:16,039
I thought I recognized you two.

785
00:52:16,541 --> 00:52:18,542
- Hi, Vada.
- Hi.

786
00:52:20,419 --> 00:52:23,358
- We were picking things up for
the barbecue. - Yeah, me, too.

787
00:52:23,537 --> 00:52:25,311
Mind if I tag along?

788
00:52:25,346 --> 00:52:26,675
Not at all.

789
00:52:27,426 --> 00:52:31,929
- A lot of potatoes.
- It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.

790
00:52:32,222 --> 00:52:33,556
I'm looking forward to that.

791
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,391
Hey! Damn it!

792
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:38,602
- Vada, watch what you're doing.
- Sorry.

793
00:52:40,605 --> 00:52:42,982
You know, this is gonna be
my first Fourth of July picnic.

794
00:52:43,066 --> 00:52:44,108
Really?

795
00:52:44,192 --> 00:52:47,444
Dad, didn't you say
you needed prunes real bad?

796
00:52:47,529 --> 00:52:51,073
Vada, just put anything you
want in the cart, anything at all.

797
00:52:51,908 --> 00:52:54,702
I don't know what's gotten into her today.

798
00:52:55,036 --> 00:52:57,037
I need olives.

799
00:52:57,747 --> 00:53:02,042
I used to like my Ken and Barbie dolls.
Ken was my favorite.

800
00:53:02,127 --> 00:53:03,836
Then one Christmas, I got them a camper

801
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,672
and all they wanted to do
was hang out in it by themselves.

802
00:53:06,756 --> 00:53:10,426
So I wasn't too upset when they took that
wrong turn and went over a cliff.

803
00:53:11,043 --> 00:53:14,944
<i>Gave proof through the night</i>

804
00:53:15,013 --> 00:53:19,040
<i>That our flag was still there</i>

805
00:53:19,117 --> 00:53:23,952
<i>Oh, say does that star-spangled</i>

806
00:53:24,022 --> 00:53:28,618
<i>Banner yet wave</i>

807
00:53:53,093 --> 00:53:56,054
Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry.

808
00:53:56,138 --> 00:53:58,931
I told you to use fewer briquettes
and now look what you've done.

809
00:53:59,015 --> 00:54:02,392
- You've cremated them.
- That's what I do.

810
00:54:02,727 --> 00:54:04,019
- You want to do it?
- No, no, no.

811
00:54:04,103 --> 00:54:05,354
If you think you know how,

812
00:54:05,438 --> 00:54:07,272
why don't you pre-measure
the briquettes into little packages?

813
00:54:07,357 --> 00:54:09,524
Put out a product. Support me for a while.

814
00:54:09,609 --> 00:54:12,027
- How's it going, chef?
- Okay.

815
00:54:12,111 --> 00:54:14,196
- I love your apron.
- Thanks.

816
00:54:14,656 --> 00:54:17,866
- Are they ready yet?
- No, sweetie, not yet.

817
00:54:17,951 --> 00:54:20,410
- When?
- Soon, honey, soon.

818
00:54:20,495 --> 00:54:21,536
When?

819
00:54:21,621 --> 00:54:24,498
In a minute. Look, it's hot.
Sweetie, you'll burn your nose.

820
00:54:24,582 --> 00:54:25,707
Look out.

821
00:54:39,514 --> 00:54:43,849
Rub-a-dub-dub. Thanks for the grub.
Yay, God.

822
00:54:43,934 --> 00:54:45,559
I'll second that.

823
00:54:45,894 --> 00:54:47,019
Hey, Shelly, like seafood?

824
00:54:47,354 --> 00:54:48,479
Why?

825
00:54:49,022 --> 00:54:50,273
See food.

826
00:54:50,607 --> 00:54:52,525
That's attractive.

827
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:56,195
Shit!

828
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:57,863
Excuse me.

829
00:55:01,243 --> 00:55:03,786
Hey, Shelly.
Who lives here, The Addams Family?

830
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:05,329
Danny, what are you doing here?

831
00:55:05,414 --> 00:55:07,290
What am I doing here? What am I doing here?

832
00:55:07,374 --> 00:55:08,708
Hi, Ralph.

833
00:55:08,792 --> 00:55:12,003
- Danny, how did you find me?
- You told everybody where you were going.

834
00:55:12,087 --> 00:55:14,255
- I'm here for the motor home.
- No!

835
00:55:14,339 --> 00:55:17,133
These two people
do not have a good relationship.

836
00:55:17,384 --> 00:55:19,969
I've been living in it for over a year.
The camper is mine.

837
00:55:20,053 --> 00:55:22,305
Excuse me. "Mutual asset. "
That's what the lawyer said.

838
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:25,974
It's supposed to be our mutual asset,
not Shelly's recreational vehicle.

839
00:55:26,058 --> 00:55:27,225
- Give me the keys.
- Keep your voice down...

840
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:29,144
- Why?
- My boss is watching us.

841
00:55:29,228 --> 00:55:30,729
I'm impressed.

842
00:55:31,731 --> 00:55:34,983
- God, I guess I have to introduce you now.
- Yeah, all right.

843
00:55:38,195 --> 00:55:42,032
This is Harry, Phil,
Gramoo and Vada Sultenfuss.

844
00:55:42,116 --> 00:55:43,742
Vada Sultenfuss?

845
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:45,410
Tough break.

846
00:55:45,661 --> 00:55:47,162
I like my name.

847
00:55:47,413 --> 00:55:52,083
This is Danny and Ralph.
They own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.

848
00:55:52,585 --> 00:55:53,585
We used to be married.

849
00:55:53,878 --> 00:55:55,587
Are you here to take Shelly back?

850
00:55:55,838 --> 00:55:57,047
Nice to meet you.

851
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:01,259
We got burgers and hot dogs here
if you care to join us.

852
00:56:01,344 --> 00:56:05,889
- I can't stay. I'm here because my wife...
- Ex! Ex. Ex.

853
00:56:06,098 --> 00:56:09,099
My ex-wife seems
to have ripped off my camper.

854
00:56:09,267 --> 00:56:10,309
Shelly?

855
00:56:10,435 --> 00:56:13,354
Honestly, Harry, he got the Mustang.
I promise...

856
00:56:13,438 --> 00:56:16,565
I don't think so. In fact, I've got a copy
of the property settlement right here.

857
00:56:16,649 --> 00:56:19,276
Shit! This is my lease.

858
00:56:20,028 --> 00:56:22,863
Damn it, I keep forgetting things.
I'm getting senile.

859
00:56:23,281 --> 00:56:24,698
- Danny?
- What?

860
00:56:25,992 --> 00:56:29,161
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss

861
00:56:29,245 --> 00:56:32,206
and there's really nothing
anyone can do to comfort you.

862
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:36,460
But I urge you to focus
on the times you had with the camper.

863
00:56:36,961 --> 00:56:39,463
The trips you took, the sights you saw.

864
00:56:39,547 --> 00:56:42,132
Those days are gone now,
but they'll live on in your heart forever.

865
00:56:43,426 --> 00:56:44,551
Is this guy boinking you?

866
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:47,596
That's a real bonehead thing to say!

867
00:56:48,348 --> 00:56:50,139
Look, you're not going
to take Shelly's camper.

868
00:56:50,265 --> 00:56:51,474
No?

869
00:56:51,558 --> 00:56:55,353
- It's her home. It's where she lives.
- Oh, really? Okay, fine. Look, go cook.

870
00:56:55,437 --> 00:56:56,813
Give me the goddamn keys.

871
00:56:56,897 --> 00:56:58,356
- Stop that, that hurts!
- Come on.

872
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,191
Danny!

873
00:57:00,818 --> 00:57:02,318
What did you do that for?

874
00:57:02,403 --> 00:57:04,570
- Who are you?
- I'm his brother.

875
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:08,116
Then you'll probably be visiting us here
quite often.

876
00:57:08,242 --> 00:57:09,242
Why?

877
00:57:09,743 --> 00:57:11,869
Because if he ever tries
to take Shelly's camper again,

878
00:57:11,954 --> 00:57:14,580
I'm going to bury him in my front yard.

879
00:57:18,836 --> 00:57:20,753
Your father's a savage.

880
00:57:23,715 --> 00:57:25,091
Bye, Ralph.

881
00:57:30,305 --> 00:57:32,890
Well, you were pretty great.

882
00:57:33,433 --> 00:57:35,183
Is it really your camper?

883
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:42,149
Look!

884
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:49,948
- Can you see them from the backyard?
- You can get the general idea.

885
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:58,165
Yeah, there they are.
They always look the same every year.

886
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:00,167
Look.

887
00:58:04,046 --> 00:58:05,547
Did you

888
00:58:06,132 --> 00:58:07,382
love him?

889
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:13,430
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.

890
00:58:16,892 --> 00:58:18,684
He must like Shelly.

891
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,729
I never saw him hit anyone in his life.

892
00:58:22,814 --> 00:58:24,356
He likes her.

893
00:58:25,984 --> 00:58:27,693
Does he love her?

894
00:58:28,695 --> 00:58:29,945
Probably.

895
00:58:32,491 --> 00:58:34,325
Do you like her?

896
00:58:34,576 --> 00:58:35,868
Yes, I do.

897
00:58:36,953 --> 00:58:40,581
- And I think she's very
good for your father. - Why?

898
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:45,169
After your mother died,
he was sad all the time,

899
00:58:45,253 --> 00:58:48,631
but before that, he was pretty funny.

900
00:58:49,674 --> 00:58:50,799
Really?

901
00:58:55,138 --> 00:58:57,389
Now when I see him with Shelly,

902
00:58:58,183 --> 00:59:00,433
sometimes he seems like the old Harry.

903
00:59:01,227 --> 00:59:02,852
My dad was funny?

904
00:59:04,813 --> 00:59:08,399
Well, he wasn't one of the Marx Brothers,
but he made me laugh.

905
00:59:12,279 --> 00:59:14,447
My uncle fought in the Korean War.

906
00:59:14,532 --> 00:59:16,741
He had a steel plate put in his head.

907
00:59:16,825 --> 00:59:19,202
Daddy said he didn't come back the same.

908
00:59:19,286 --> 00:59:23,748
One night we picked up a radio station
from Oklahoma in his teeth.

909
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:25,917
It was really neat.

910
00:59:30,381 --> 00:59:33,091
- Can't you see it?
- What?

911
00:59:33,175 --> 00:59:35,677
- Can't you see it?
- No.

912
00:59:35,761 --> 00:59:36,761
It's there.

913
00:59:36,845 --> 00:59:39,472
Vada, there is no chicken bone
stuck in your throat.

914
00:59:40,849 --> 00:59:43,559
Dr. Welty, are you sure those are yours?

915
00:59:45,728 --> 00:59:49,982
So you fill it with water, like this,
and what have you got?

916
00:59:50,066 --> 00:59:51,275
A water gun.

917
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:54,987
- Cool! Can I get one for Vada?
- Yes, yes.

918
00:59:55,947 --> 00:59:57,990
Thomas, let me ask you a question.

919
00:59:58,449 --> 01:00:01,118
Does Vada ever tell you
why she comes down here so much?

920
01:00:01,202 --> 01:00:02,411
'Cause she's dying.

921
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:04,663
- Do you think she is?
- No.

922
01:00:05,206 --> 01:00:06,665
Why do you think she says that?

923
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,501
Because she gets scared
of all those dead people in her house.

924
01:00:09,586 --> 01:00:12,838
And you know that saying,
"Can't beat them, join them. "

925
01:00:12,922 --> 01:00:15,340
Well, if she's one of them,
she won't be as scared.

926
01:00:15,425 --> 01:00:16,925
You know what I think?

927
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:19,886
I think Vada's very lucky
to have a friend like you.

928
01:00:20,513 --> 01:00:22,347
She's my best friend.

929
01:00:23,808 --> 01:00:25,726
Miss Vada, how are you feeling?

930
01:00:26,602 --> 01:00:28,352
As good as can be expected.

931
01:00:31,356 --> 01:00:32,648
Hey, Vada, guess what we got?

932
01:00:32,733 --> 01:00:34,191
- What?
- This.

933
01:00:34,276 --> 01:00:37,028
Hey, you! I'm going to get you!

934
01:00:37,696 --> 01:00:39,488
I'll get you!

935
01:00:39,573 --> 01:00:40,740
Give me that, you creep!

936
01:00:43,869 --> 01:00:45,161
I just got you.

937
01:00:45,412 --> 01:00:46,954
No, you didn't.

938
01:00:47,372 --> 01:00:49,624
- Whoa.
- What?

939
01:00:49,708 --> 01:00:51,917
- There's a beehive right there.
- So?

940
01:00:52,419 --> 01:00:53,794
Stand back.

941
01:00:56,048 --> 01:00:58,382
Are you crazy? You'll get stung.

942
01:00:58,759 --> 01:01:00,468
You're right. Let's knock it down.

943
01:01:00,552 --> 01:01:04,055
- What do you want it for, anyway?
- 'Cause they're neat.

944
01:01:11,604 --> 01:01:12,979
I got it.

945
01:01:14,398 --> 01:01:17,567
My mood ring. It fell off. I got to find it.

946
01:01:24,617 --> 01:01:26,826
They're alive! Run for your life!

947
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:43,510
- Run faster! They're after us!
- I am running faster!

948
01:01:44,303 --> 01:01:45,929
- Hurry!
- Jump in the water!

949
01:01:46,347 --> 01:01:48,973
- But I have my clothes on!
- Do it!

950
01:02:03,697 --> 01:02:06,490
- Vada, is that you?
- Yes.

951
01:02:06,574 --> 01:02:09,326
Hey, guess what.
We're going to the carnival tonight.

952
01:02:09,411 --> 01:02:11,286
Be ready to go in 10 minutes.

953
01:02:11,913 --> 01:02:13,622
Shelly's coming with us.

954
01:02:24,384 --> 01:02:28,220
- So, Vada, what's your favorite ride?
- I like the freak show.

955
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,055
I know, I know.

956
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:32,182
Let's go on
the sit-on-the-bench-and-rest ride.

957
01:02:33,768 --> 01:02:36,936
I don't think that the roller coaster agreed
with your dad's stomach.

958
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,063
You know, Vada,
you have to watch what you eat here.

959
01:02:39,148 --> 01:02:42,233
I remember once I went to a carnival
with my cousins, David and Frank,

960
01:02:42,317 --> 01:02:43,735
and they both ate hot dogs

961
01:02:43,819 --> 01:02:45,737
and the next day
they came down with nephritis.

962
01:02:45,821 --> 01:02:48,030
Nephritis is a kidney disease.

963
01:02:48,532 --> 01:02:51,033
- You don't get it from hot dogs.
- Well, I'm no doctor.

964
01:02:51,118 --> 01:02:53,745
All I know is, the next day
they had really high fevers

965
01:02:53,829 --> 01:02:55,955
and their faces got very fat.

966
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:59,500
They baffled medical science.
They were in a magazine.

967
01:03:00,711 --> 01:03:02,044
They were!

968
01:03:02,129 --> 01:03:04,964
Popular Mechanics... No, Popular Science.

969
01:03:05,507 --> 01:03:07,175
I don't know. It was Popular.

970
01:03:07,634 --> 01:03:12,263
- Look, they're trying to hit that poor
thing. - Watch you don't knock out a fish.

971
01:03:12,347 --> 01:03:13,848
Just arc it.

972
01:03:17,269 --> 01:03:19,187
I don't know which ball's mine.

973
01:03:19,563 --> 01:03:22,564
- I won! I won!
- Great!

974
01:03:22,648 --> 01:03:25,150
We have a winner. There you go, little girl.

975
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:26,568
See how easy it is, folks.

976
01:03:26,652 --> 01:03:29,780
Vada, that's a gorgeous goldfish.

977
01:03:31,032 --> 01:03:32,491
Where did you get that ring?

978
01:03:35,453 --> 01:03:36,995
Did you win it?

979
01:03:43,628 --> 01:03:45,212
Vada, we have something to tell you.

980
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:48,757
Harry?

981
01:03:52,136 --> 01:03:53,845
Vada, we have some good news.

982
01:03:54,722 --> 01:03:56,097
Shelly and I are getting married.

983
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:00,519
My fish!

984
01:04:04,189 --> 01:04:07,149
We're having the wedding
sometime near the end of the summer.

985
01:04:07,484 --> 01:04:09,610
You'll be okay, little fish.

986
01:04:09,736 --> 01:04:10,861
Vada,

987
01:04:12,656 --> 01:04:14,698
would you like us
to get you another goldfish?

988
01:04:15,492 --> 01:04:16,534
No.

989
01:04:17,118 --> 01:04:18,118
He's fine.

990
01:04:19,246 --> 01:04:21,789
Fish are very resilient animals, you know.

991
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:25,459
Don't worry. I won't get another fish.

992
01:04:29,297 --> 01:04:31,966
The bumper car! The bumper car!

993
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:36,178
For just 50 cents,
a half dollar, five dimes, ten nickels,

994
01:04:36,263 --> 01:04:40,307
we have a ride that's guaranteed
to rearrange all of your internal organs.

995
01:04:40,433 --> 01:04:44,478
Don't pass me by!
That's the bumper car ride!

996
01:04:44,563 --> 01:04:45,938
Bumper cars!

997
01:04:46,022 --> 01:04:48,982
You can't go to a carnival
and not ride the bumper cars.

998
01:04:49,066 --> 01:04:50,984
I'd fall asleep at the wheel.

999
01:04:51,068 --> 01:04:55,113
- I'll ride on the bumper cars with you.
- Great, Vada, come on.

1000
01:04:59,994 --> 01:05:02,453
Two. I got the blue one!

1001
01:05:02,705 --> 01:05:04,372
- No.
- Yes.

1002
01:05:06,709 --> 01:05:08,835
I'm going to come get you.

1003
01:05:16,635 --> 01:05:18,469
Vada, keep your hands on the wheel.

1004
01:05:57,216 --> 01:05:58,842
Careful, Vada. Careful.

1005
01:06:00,094 --> 01:06:01,720
Shelly, look out!

1006
01:06:32,709 --> 01:06:35,252
- Hi, Vada.
- Hi, can Thomas J. come out?

1007
01:06:35,337 --> 01:06:36,963
Sure, come on in.

1008
01:06:39,841 --> 01:06:42,343
- Hi, Vada.
- Hi. Want to ride bikes?

1009
01:06:42,427 --> 01:06:43,636
Sure.

1010
01:06:44,846 --> 01:06:46,681
- Did you make your bed?
- Yes.

1011
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:49,058
- You're sure?
- It's made.

1012
01:06:49,142 --> 01:06:52,061
Come here. You've got a milk mustache.

1013
01:06:55,315 --> 01:06:56,523
Come on, let's go.

1014
01:06:57,149 --> 01:06:59,859
- Bye, Mrs. Sennett.
- Bye, Ma.

1015
01:06:59,944 --> 01:07:01,486
Have fun, kids.

1016
01:07:04,031 --> 01:07:07,450
- I'm running away.
- Where you running to?

1017
01:07:08,577 --> 01:07:09,911
California.

1018
01:07:09,996 --> 01:07:12,455
Going to Hollywood
to live with The Brady Bunch.

1019
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:15,500
- I want to live with them, too.
- No, you can't.

1020
01:07:15,584 --> 01:07:16,918
They have enough kids.

1021
01:07:17,003 --> 01:07:19,170
You'll have to live with
The Partridge Family.

1022
01:07:20,172 --> 01:07:21,381
Really?

1023
01:07:36,939 --> 01:07:38,314
That's it.

1024
01:07:48,908 --> 01:07:51,285
- Get up.
- I'm tired of running away.

1025
01:07:51,703 --> 01:07:54,621
Besides, we passed
this place two times already.

1026
01:07:54,706 --> 01:07:56,040
We're not getting nowhere.

1027
01:07:59,002 --> 01:08:00,294
So, why are you running away?

1028
01:08:01,713 --> 01:08:05,841
- My dad gave Shelly a ring.
- Wow! Was it a decoder ring?

1029
01:08:06,468 --> 01:08:10,012
You're such a retard.
It was an engagement ring.

1030
01:08:10,305 --> 01:08:11,972
They're getting married?

1031
01:08:12,515 --> 01:08:13,849
So now you have a mother.

1032
01:08:14,267 --> 01:08:15,350
I don't like her.

1033
01:08:15,894 --> 01:08:17,561
I do. She's real funny.

1034
01:08:18,813 --> 01:08:20,814
He likes her better than me.

1035
01:08:26,987 --> 01:08:30,698
- I'm hungry. I can't last any longer.
- Then go home, baby.

1036
01:08:30,991 --> 01:08:33,367
I have to, anyway. My mom will be worried.

1037
01:08:33,827 --> 01:08:35,828
Leave then. Some friend you are.

1038
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:38,331
You can come to my house for dinner.

1039
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:40,625
No, I'm hiding out.

1040
01:08:41,418 --> 01:08:42,919
Okay, see you.

1041
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:42,769
Are the gentlemen going to stay or not?

1042
01:09:45,898 --> 01:09:47,983
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said,
Mr. Deeds.

1043
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:52,486
The whole Circle fortune goes to you.
$20 million.

1044
01:09:52,571 --> 01:09:53,988
Oh, yes, I heard you all right.

1045
01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:56,073
Twenty million,
that's quite a lot, isn't it?

1046
01:09:56,575 --> 01:09:58,033
It will do in a pinch.

1047
01:09:58,118 --> 01:10:01,579
I wonder why he left me all that money?
I don't need it.

1048
01:10:03,665 --> 01:10:05,207
In social studies we learned some people

1049
01:10:05,292 --> 01:10:08,544
stole the Lindbergh baby
right out of his house.

1050
01:10:08,628 --> 01:10:11,714
I think I'll sleep
with my window open tonight.

1051
01:10:15,802 --> 01:10:17,178
Oh, my God!

1052
01:10:17,929 --> 01:10:19,138
Daddy!

1053
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:21,599
Daddy! Daddy!

1054
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:24,561
Daddy!

1055
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,187
Daddy!

1056
01:10:27,564 --> 01:10:29,857
- Daddy!
- Vada, what's the matter?

1057
01:10:31,234 --> 01:10:32,234
Where's Daddy?

1058
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,694
- He just left. What's wrong?
- I'm hemorrhaging.

1059
01:10:34,778 --> 01:10:36,070
What do you mean, you're hemorrhaging?

1060
01:10:36,155 --> 01:10:40,658
- I don't want or need your help.
- Vada, did this happen in the bathroom?

1061
01:10:42,453 --> 01:10:44,579
- How old are you?
- I'm 11 and a half.

1062
01:10:45,581 --> 01:10:46,623
It's okay.

1063
01:10:47,041 --> 01:10:48,791
Come on upstairs.
We have to have a little talk.

1064
01:10:52,463 --> 01:10:54,464
My mommy and daddy did that?

1065
01:10:55,049 --> 01:10:57,342
Actually, a very beautiful thing.

1066
01:10:59,011 --> 01:11:00,595
And look, there wouldn't have been a Vada.

1067
01:11:01,263 --> 01:11:02,680
I think it should be outlawed.

1068
01:11:03,224 --> 01:11:04,807
Believe me, someday you'll feel differently.

1069
01:11:06,852 --> 01:11:09,479
That's probably Thomas J.
I don't want to see him.

1070
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,941
It's not fair.

1071
01:11:13,317 --> 01:11:15,318
Nothing happens to boys.

1072
01:11:19,364 --> 01:11:21,406
Hi, Vada. Can you come out?

1073
01:11:22,408 --> 01:11:23,575
I don't know.

1074
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:26,703
Please. It's real hot.
Maybe we can go swimming.

1075
01:11:28,831 --> 01:11:31,250
No. Get out of here.

1076
01:11:32,627 --> 01:11:35,587
And don't come back
for five to seven days!

1077
01:11:53,273 --> 01:11:56,858
Gramoo, I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

1078
01:11:58,987 --> 01:12:00,319
Stay here.

1079
01:12:58,095 --> 01:13:00,620
<i>It's quarter to three</i>

1080
01:13:01,365 --> 01:13:03,890
<i>There's no one in the place</i>

1081
01:13:04,001 --> 01:13:06,561
<i>Just you and me</i>

1082
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:09,662
<i>So set them up, Joe</i>

1083
01:13:09,773 --> 01:13:14,005
<i>I've got a little story
you ought to know</i>

1084
01:13:14,978 --> 01:13:17,276
<i>We're coming, my friend</i>

1085
01:13:18,549 --> 01:13:22,986
<i>- To the end of brief episode
- I'm so sorry.</i>

1086
01:13:23,043 --> 01:13:27,009
<i>- All right, Ma. It's okay.
- So make it one for my baby</i>

1087
01:13:27,657 --> 01:13:31,684
<i>- And one more for the road
- Very, very sorry.</i>

1088
01:13:36,164 --> 01:13:37,623
Now what were you thinking, huh?

1089
01:13:38,792 --> 01:13:40,876
It's your responsibility to watch her!

1090
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,421
Do you have any idea how upset
those people are in there?

1091
01:13:58,269 --> 01:14:00,813
Why do you think people
want to get married?

1092
01:14:01,314 --> 01:14:03,482
When you get older, you just have to.

1093
01:14:04,984 --> 01:14:06,944
I'm going to marry Mr. Bixler.

1094
01:14:07,570 --> 01:14:09,946
You can't marry a teacher.
It's against the law.

1095
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:12,407
- It is not.
- Yes, it is.

1096
01:14:12,491 --> 01:14:15,326
'Cause then he'll give you
all A's and it won't be fair.

1097
01:14:15,828 --> 01:14:17,120
Not true.

1098
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:22,166
Have you ever kissed anyone?

1099
01:14:23,836 --> 01:14:25,336
Like they do on TV?

1100
01:14:26,839 --> 01:14:27,839
No.

1101
01:14:30,801 --> 01:14:33,928
Well, maybe we should,
just to see what's the big deal.

1102
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:36,722
But I don't know how.

1103
01:14:37,307 --> 01:14:39,684
Here, practice on your arm like this.

1104
01:14:40,519 --> 01:14:41,769
Like this?

1105
01:14:45,232 --> 01:14:46,899
Okay, enough practice.

1106
01:14:47,568 --> 01:14:48,734
Close your eyes.

1107
01:14:49,445 --> 01:14:50,695
Then I won't be able to see anything.

1108
01:14:51,363 --> 01:14:53,780
- Just do it.
- Okay, okay.

1109
01:14:57,535 --> 01:14:59,369
Okay, on the count of three.

1110
01:15:00,872 --> 01:15:02,038
One.

1111
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:04,082
Two.

1112
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:05,542
Two and a half.

1113
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:07,377
Three.

1114
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,679
Say something. It's too quiet.

1115
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:22,642
Just hurry.

1116
01:15:24,395 --> 01:15:28,815
"I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America

1117
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:31,401
- "and to the Republic for which it stands.
- "For which it stands.

1118
01:15:31,611 --> 01:15:34,654
- "One nation under God, indivisible.
- "One nation under God, indivisible,

1119
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:37,948
- "with liberty and justice for all. "
- "with liberty and justice for all. "

1120
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:01,972
- You better not tell anyone.
- You better not either.

1121
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:05,518
- Well, let's spit on it.
- Okay.

1122
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:09,897
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay, see you.

1123
01:16:10,398 --> 01:16:11,482
Vada?

1124
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:13,442
What?

1125
01:16:14,444 --> 01:16:15,819
Would you think of me?

1126
01:16:16,279 --> 01:16:17,571
For what?

1127
01:16:18,698 --> 01:16:21,241
If you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.

1128
01:16:23,327 --> 01:16:24,577
I guess.

1129
01:17:12,709 --> 01:17:13,792
Yes.

1130
01:17:22,844 --> 01:17:23,927
No.

1131
01:17:24,178 --> 01:17:25,470
God, no.

1132
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:28,682
Get away.

1133
01:17:29,517 --> 01:17:30,559
Get away!

1134
01:18:14,061 --> 01:18:15,311
Hi, Vada.

1135
01:18:15,437 --> 01:18:16,687
Hi.

1136
01:18:19,983 --> 01:18:21,150
What are you doing?

1137
01:18:21,652 --> 01:18:22,902
Feeding my fish.

1138
01:18:27,532 --> 01:18:30,492
- Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
- Yes.

1139
01:18:33,579 --> 01:18:35,246
He's getting big.

1140
01:18:39,877 --> 01:18:42,337
Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.

1141
01:18:46,425 --> 01:18:50,512
Vada, something happened
to Thomas J. last night.

1142
01:18:52,598 --> 01:18:54,724
He stepped on a beehive.

1143
01:18:55,393 --> 01:18:57,811
I told him not to tease those bees.

1144
01:18:58,062 --> 01:18:59,229
Did he get stung?

1145
01:19:03,234 --> 01:19:05,485
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.

1146
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:10,448
No, sweetheart. You can't.

1147
01:19:13,451 --> 01:19:14,702
Why not?

1148
01:19:18,373 --> 01:19:19,998
He was allergic to bees.

1149
01:19:22,043 --> 01:19:23,794
He's okay, isn't he?

1150
01:19:26,506 --> 01:19:28,590
There were just too many of them.

1151
01:19:46,443 --> 01:19:47,776
Dr. Welty!

1152
01:19:49,154 --> 01:19:50,154
Dr. Welty!

1153
01:19:50,238 --> 01:19:52,865
Vada, what's wrong, sweetheart?

1154
01:19:52,949 --> 01:19:56,159
- I can't breathe. I'm suffocating.
- Wait, relax now.

1155
01:19:56,243 --> 01:19:57,410
Let me look. It's okay.

1156
01:19:57,494 --> 01:20:00,496
Up here, we'll have a look. That's a girl.

1157
01:20:00,873 --> 01:20:03,666
It hurts. It hurts so bad.

1158
01:20:03,792 --> 01:20:07,003
- Make it stop.
- What hurts, Vada?

1159
01:20:07,379 --> 01:20:09,005
The bee stings!

1160
01:20:09,089 --> 01:20:10,673
I can't breathe.

1161
01:20:36,742 --> 01:20:37,909
Vada?

1162
01:20:39,577 --> 01:20:43,121
I'm leaving some food for you by the door
in case you get hungry.

1163
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:51,838
- Hi.
- Hi. Is Vada home?

1164
01:20:52,298 --> 01:20:56,885
Yes, she is, but she's very upset
so she's not seeing anyone.

1165
01:20:57,386 --> 01:21:00,055
I'm Judy. I go to school with her.

1166
01:21:00,139 --> 01:21:02,599
I wanted to tell her I'm
sorry about Thomas J.

1167
01:21:03,935 --> 01:21:05,894
Well, maybe she'll feel better
in a couple days.

1168
01:21:06,145 --> 01:21:07,229
Will you tell her I came by?

1169
01:21:08,231 --> 01:21:09,856
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1170
01:21:09,941 --> 01:21:11,900
- Bye.
- Bye.

1171
01:21:19,951 --> 01:21:21,992
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Reverend Moss.

1172
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:25,538
The Sennett's want to thank you
for taking care of things so quickly.

1173
01:21:36,216 --> 01:21:37,299
Vada?

1174
01:21:38,009 --> 01:21:39,969
I see you took your tray in.

1175
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:43,597
Maybe you should come down
for the funeral.

1176
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:45,683
Sometimes it helps.

1177
01:21:46,977 --> 01:21:48,185
Vada?

1178
01:21:56,695 --> 01:21:58,445
She won't come out.

1179
01:21:59,823 --> 01:22:01,574
It's been a whole day.

1180
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:05,285
You have to do something, Harry.

1181
01:22:05,995 --> 01:22:07,537
The funeral's starting.

1182
01:22:07,621 --> 01:22:10,331
Open your eyes. She's 11 years old.

1183
01:22:11,292 --> 01:22:13,042
Her only friend in the world is dead.

1184
01:22:13,127 --> 01:22:15,295
I know that, but what do you want from me?

1185
01:22:15,504 --> 01:22:17,255
Stop hiding, Harry.

1186
01:22:18,299 --> 01:22:19,424
You run, Harry.

1187
01:22:20,551 --> 01:22:21,968
When I first came here,

1188
01:22:22,261 --> 01:22:25,972
the idea of working with dead people
didn't exactly thrill me.

1189
01:22:27,433 --> 01:22:29,851
But when I saw a family lived here,

1190
01:22:31,061 --> 01:22:32,478
I thought,

1191
01:22:33,689 --> 01:22:35,899
"If I'm living without a family,

1192
01:22:36,609 --> 01:22:38,276
"at least I can work with one.

1193
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:42,155
"And maybe once in a while
be invited in for supper. "

1194
01:22:42,323 --> 01:22:43,252
Yeah.

1195
01:22:43,595 --> 01:22:46,068
And when those suppers are disrupted
because there's a car crash,

1196
01:22:46,157 --> 01:22:48,501
or there's a fire,
or a little boy steps on a beehive.

1197
01:22:48,536 --> 01:22:52,122
I'm not asking you
to stop feeling for those people.

1198
01:22:54,667 --> 01:22:56,668
But life isn't just death, Harry.

1199
01:22:59,005 --> 01:23:00,464
Don't ignore the living.

1200
01:23:02,383 --> 01:23:04,384
Especially your daughter.

1201
01:23:07,722 --> 01:23:10,515
Excuse me, Harry, Shelly,
the minister's about to begin.

1202
01:23:11,184 --> 01:23:12,851
Thank you, Arthur.

1203
01:23:27,533 --> 01:23:31,411
We are here to honor Thomas James Sennett.

1204
01:23:32,537 --> 01:23:37,291
He was born May 7, 1961
in Madison, Pennsylvania.

1205
01:23:37,793 --> 01:23:41,879
He is survived by his loving parents,
Charles and Susan Sennett,

1206
01:23:42,214 --> 01:23:45,466
his grandparents,
William and Gloria Sennett,

1207
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:47,176
and Gerald and Marjorie Finn,

1208
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:49,929
and many relatives, friends and schoolmates.

1209
01:23:51,932 --> 01:23:55,226
The interment will follow
at Madison Memorial Park.

1210
01:23:56,061 --> 01:23:59,814
The family has asked me to say a few words
before we proceed to the cemetery.

1211
01:24:02,401 --> 01:24:03,985
No words I could say

1212
01:24:04,069 --> 01:24:07,905
would begin to express
the loss and grief we feel.

1213
01:24:09,491 --> 01:24:13,828
One word that keeps ringing
in my ear is "why?"

1214
01:24:15,037 --> 01:24:17,622
Why would God choose
to take this little boy from us?

1215
01:24:19,875 --> 01:24:22,711
Well, I can't give you
an answer to that question,

1216
01:24:22,795 --> 01:24:26,548
but I can tell you
that God has chosen Thomas J.

1217
01:24:26,632 --> 01:24:28,842
for some very special reason.

1218
01:24:30,511 --> 01:24:34,431
We must find solace
in knowing that Thomas J. is in God's care.

1219
01:24:35,099 --> 01:24:39,102
In that place,
there is no sorrow or suffering.

1220
01:24:40,187 --> 01:24:44,315
The lion lies with the lamb.
The day is not divided.

1221
01:24:45,109 --> 01:24:47,569
I'd like to read a passage from the Bible.

1222
01:24:49,447 --> 01:24:51,948
This is Matthew 19:13.

1223
01:24:53,075 --> 01:24:55,869
"At one point, children were brought to him

1224
01:24:55,953 --> 01:24:58,954
"that he might lay his hands
on them and pray.

1225
01:24:59,289 --> 01:25:01,248
"The disciples began to chastise them.

1226
01:25:02,042 --> 01:25:05,461
"But Jesus said,
'Let the children come to me.

1227
01:25:06,796 --> 01:25:08,672
"Do not hinder them.

1228
01:25:08,757 --> 01:25:12,092
"The kingdom of God
belongs to such as these. "

1229
01:25:13,219 --> 01:25:15,179
"And he laid his hands on their heads

1230
01:25:16,723 --> 01:25:18,432
"before he left that place. "

1231
01:25:19,225 --> 01:25:21,393
Let us pray in silence.

1232
01:25:23,146 --> 01:25:25,773
You want to go tree-climbing, Thomas J?

1233
01:25:26,107 --> 01:25:27,316
His face hurts.

1234
01:25:27,817 --> 01:25:30,652
And where is his glasses?
He can't see without his glasses.

1235
01:25:32,363 --> 01:25:35,699
Put his glasses on. Put on his glasses.

1236
01:25:38,328 --> 01:25:39,912
He was going to be an acrobat.

1237
01:25:39,996 --> 01:25:43,498
- He's gone, sweetheart. He's gone.
- Get away from me!

1238
01:25:47,961 --> 01:25:49,378
Vada, wait!

1239
01:25:49,463 --> 01:25:50,671
Vada!

1240
01:25:52,508 --> 01:25:53,716
Vada!

1241
01:26:05,771 --> 01:26:08,439
Vada, I was just on my way to your house.

1242
01:26:08,524 --> 01:26:10,274
Are you all right?

1243
01:26:10,359 --> 01:26:11,692
I'm so sorry about Thomas J.

1244
01:26:13,737 --> 01:26:15,863
Okay, we don't have to talk about him.

1245
01:26:16,990 --> 01:26:19,408
Vada, Vada, we don't have to talk about him.
It's okay.

1246
01:26:19,493 --> 01:26:20,785
We won't talk about him.

1247
01:26:20,869 --> 01:26:24,122
Justin and Ronda say
that I should tell people what I feel.

1248
01:26:25,456 --> 01:26:27,833
Come here, sit down. Sit down over here.

1249
01:26:30,461 --> 01:26:31,920
Mr. Bixler...

1250
01:26:33,548 --> 01:26:34,881
I love you.

1251
01:26:35,675 --> 01:26:36,716
Vada...

1252
01:26:37,176 --> 01:26:39,678
I love you like my dad loves Shelly.

1253
01:26:40,721 --> 01:26:42,139
I want to live here.

1254
01:26:45,810 --> 01:26:47,561
I think your dad would miss you.

1255
01:26:47,645 --> 01:26:49,521
No, he wouldn't.

1256
01:26:49,605 --> 01:26:51,148
I can't go home.

1257
01:26:51,232 --> 01:26:54,985
Jake, I'll be ready in a second.
I can't seem to find my other earring.

1258
01:26:56,154 --> 01:26:57,654
Suzanne, this is Vada.

1259
01:26:57,738 --> 01:27:00,157
Vada, hi.

1260
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:02,159
I'm really sorry.

1261
01:27:02,243 --> 01:27:04,703
- Could you just give us a minute?
- Yeah.

1262
01:27:08,248 --> 01:27:09,540
Who's that?

1263
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:12,501
That's Suzanne.

1264
01:27:18,258 --> 01:27:20,509
She and I are going to be married this fall.

1265
01:27:20,594 --> 01:27:21,552
No.

1266
01:27:21,636 --> 01:27:24,180
I was going to bring her to class next week.

1267
01:27:24,598 --> 01:27:26,473
I want her to hear your poem.

1268
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:29,226
Vada.

1269
01:27:29,311 --> 01:27:31,520
Please, honey.
I cared for him, too. Vada, please.

1270
01:27:31,605 --> 01:27:33,230
Get away from me.

1271
01:27:33,732 --> 01:27:34,815
Vada!

1272
01:27:36,735 --> 01:27:38,777
Vada, sweetheart, don't...

1273
01:28:11,268 --> 01:28:14,229
Why do you think
people want to get married?

1274
01:28:14,313 --> 01:28:17,023
When you get older, you just have to.

1275
01:28:21,737 --> 01:28:23,738
Who's that with your dad?

1276
01:28:24,406 --> 01:28:26,282
That's my mother.

1277
01:28:28,494 --> 01:28:31,496
I'm going to be an acrobat when I grow up.

1278
01:28:32,164 --> 01:28:33,289
Vada?

1279
01:28:34,166 --> 01:28:35,999
Would you think of me?

1280
01:28:36,751 --> 01:28:39,294
If you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.

1281
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:46,677
Now we're blood brothers for life.

1282
01:29:04,862 --> 01:29:06,697
Shelly, I'm sorry,
but we haven't found her yet.

1283
01:29:06,781 --> 01:29:08,824
It's dark. She can't be alone in the dark.

1284
01:29:08,908 --> 01:29:10,951
- We'll keep looking.
- We've been looking since this morning.

1285
01:29:11,035 --> 01:29:14,496
- Her teacher called and he said...
- I know, I know. You told us.

1286
01:29:15,498 --> 01:29:16,665
Vada?

1287
01:29:20,877 --> 01:29:22,336
Are you okay?

1288
01:29:23,088 --> 01:29:24,338
Oh, God.

1289
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:29,552
I should have told Thomas J.
that he was my best friend.

1290
01:29:31,138 --> 01:29:32,763
I'm sure he knew.

1291
01:29:42,107 --> 01:29:43,274
Shelly.

1292
01:29:44,693 --> 01:29:49,739
I stole some money from your cookie jar
to pay for the writing class.

1293
01:29:53,410 --> 01:29:56,287
- It's okay, sweetheart.
- I'll pay you back.

1294
01:29:56,371 --> 01:29:59,623
Besides, I don't think
I'll ever go to class again.

1295
01:30:02,251 --> 01:30:06,087
I'll tell you what.
You dedicate your first book to me.

1296
01:30:06,422 --> 01:30:08,089
I'll forget the whole thing.

1297
01:30:08,758 --> 01:30:11,718
- I will. I promise.
- Okay. Get into bed.

1298
01:30:34,075 --> 01:30:35,658
- Good night.
- Good night.

1299
01:30:54,803 --> 01:30:55,969
She's here.

1300
01:31:14,364 --> 01:31:16,407
Did I kill my mother?

1301
01:31:16,491 --> 01:31:17,616
What?

1302
01:31:20,912 --> 01:31:24,415
The bees killed Thomas J.
and I killed my mother.

1303
01:31:24,499 --> 01:31:25,707
No, no.

1304
01:31:34,633 --> 01:31:37,176
Now, sweetie, that wasn't your fault.

1305
01:31:38,512 --> 01:31:43,099
Things like that aren't anybody's fault.
It just happened.

1306
01:31:48,021 --> 01:31:49,522
I found this.

1307
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:57,238
I forgot about that picture.

1308
01:31:57,322 --> 01:32:00,366
- Where did you find it?
- In the garage.

1309
01:32:02,202 --> 01:32:04,370
That little Chevy
was your mother's favorite car.

1310
01:32:06,290 --> 01:32:07,874
What was my mama like?

1311
01:32:09,835 --> 01:32:11,334
She was pretty.

1312
01:32:12,211 --> 01:32:13,503
And kind.

1313
01:32:13,963 --> 01:32:15,630
And she had your eyes.

1314
01:32:18,926 --> 01:32:21,052
Boy, did she love to laugh.

1315
01:32:23,723 --> 01:32:26,057
Sometimes when you laugh,
you sound just like her.

1316
01:32:26,726 --> 01:32:27,893
Really?

1317
01:32:29,770 --> 01:32:33,440
You know what your mother did when she
found out she was going to have you?

1318
01:32:34,734 --> 01:32:37,444
She came home
and painted this whole room pink.

1319
01:32:39,363 --> 01:32:41,323
She was so sure she
would have a little girl.

1320
01:32:42,074 --> 01:32:43,700
Do you miss her?

1321
01:32:45,828 --> 01:32:46,995
Yes.

1322
01:32:47,079 --> 01:32:50,165
I did, very much, for a long time.

1323
01:32:52,418 --> 01:32:56,837
And even now I get a little sad
when I think about a pretty flower

1324
01:32:56,922 --> 01:33:00,341
or a beautiful sunset
that your mother would have liked.

1325
01:33:00,425 --> 01:33:04,762
I think every time I see or climb a tree
I'll think of Thomas J.

1326
01:33:06,348 --> 01:33:07,765
That's good.

1327
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:10,518
Memories are good, sweetheart.

1328
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:13,270
Vada, I'm...

1329
01:33:13,647 --> 01:33:14,980
I'm sorry.

1330
01:33:16,274 --> 01:33:19,568
I was trying to keep it from you.

1331
01:33:22,113 --> 01:33:23,739
I just couldn't.

1332
01:33:28,245 --> 01:33:31,497
You're a good girl. I want you to be happy.

1333
01:33:32,290 --> 01:33:34,208
Don't be an old grump like me.

1334
01:33:42,007 --> 01:33:43,925
See you in the morning.

1335
01:33:47,429 --> 01:33:48,596
Daddy?

1336
01:33:50,683 --> 01:33:52,976
It's not so bad to be like you.

1337
01:34:19,253 --> 01:34:21,545
Mrs. Sennett, how are you doing?

1338
01:34:23,631 --> 01:34:25,924
Some days I think I'll be okay.

1339
01:34:26,342 --> 01:34:31,555
Others... Well, I have
to force myself even to get out of bed.

1340
01:34:32,557 --> 01:34:34,099
I know it's crazy,

1341
01:34:34,183 --> 01:34:36,435
but sometimes I think
he's just away at summer camp.

1342
01:34:38,021 --> 01:34:39,396
How's Vada?

1343
01:34:39,856 --> 01:34:43,233
She's doing much better. She's just inside.

1344
01:34:43,818 --> 01:34:44,901
Vada!

1345
01:34:48,990 --> 01:34:51,700
- Mrs. Sennett.
- Vada.

1346
01:34:55,872 --> 01:34:58,248
I've been wanting to come over to see you.

1347
01:35:01,878 --> 01:35:03,879
Thomas J. had this on him.

1348
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:07,340
I thought you might like to have it.

1349
01:35:19,186 --> 01:35:21,646
You were such a good friend to him.

1350
01:35:22,689 --> 01:35:24,607
I hope you'll still come by and visit me.

1351
01:35:25,025 --> 01:35:27,735
I will. I promise.

1352
01:35:35,077 --> 01:35:36,160
Mrs. Sennett,

1353
01:35:38,455 --> 01:35:40,665
Thomas J. will be all right.

1354
01:35:40,749 --> 01:35:43,084
My mother will take care of him.

1355
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:48,088
Thank you, Vada.

Give me a hug.

I was hoping you'd stop by today.

1373
01:37:06,541 --> 01:37:10,043
Can't stay. I just came to read my poem.
