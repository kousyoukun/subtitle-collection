2
00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:08,200
This, is Fairy Tale Island.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,780
A magical land of princes and princesses

4
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:13,981
witches and monsters.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,330
Accidents and strange events
happen all the time.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,880
And that's when people call us.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,960
The Fearless Seven, the greatest
heroes on Fairy Tale Island.

8
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:29,300
Especially me, Merlin.

9
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:33,930
But everything changed
the day we defeated a dragon

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,850
and saved a Princess.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,650
We thought we'd saved a witch,
so, we attacked her.

12
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,860
But we were wrong.

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,820
She wasn't a witch, she was a princess.

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,200
The Fairy Princess!

15
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,130
How were we supposed to know?
She looks like a witch,

16
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:57,231
and everyone knows that a
princess doesn't look like a witch.

17
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,830
Anyways, she wanted to teach us a lesson,
so she put a curse on us.

18
00:01:03,032 --> 00:01:05,000
And this was a nasty one.

19
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,590
that turned us into little ugly green
monsters whenever people looked at us.

20
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:11,880
And the only way to break the curse

21
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,930
is to get a kiss from the
most beautiful woman in the world.

22
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,270
Are you kidding me?

23
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,016
With this face?

24
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,860
Hello, your majesty.

25
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,740
- Good morning ma'am.
- Good morning ma'am.

26
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,620
Magic tree, magic tree...

27
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:25,710
Let this morning be the time
that you perform your duty,

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
of bringing me the shoes
of youthful eternal... beauty.

29
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,270
Yes!

30
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,280
Change me!

31
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,110
Finally!

32
00:03:00,024 --> 00:03:02,160
Not again! How long must I wait?

33
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,000
- No. - Clear these away.

34
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:05,001
Uh-oh.

35
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,580
Heads off.

36
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,330
Pull yourself together.

37
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,170
Here you are.

38
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:15,130
Oh? Thanks!

39
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,830
That wasn't here before.
What is she up to now?

40
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:02,631
Huh?

41
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,370
Huh?

42
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,710
You weren't here before.

43
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,340
Whatever.

44
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,300
Oh! Oww!

45
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,470
Yes!

46
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,016
I can't believe my beloved daughter
Snow White has turned eighteen.

47
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:59,900
I only wish her mother could see the kind of
smart and beautiful young woman she's become.

48
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,370
Strange thing happened during the party.

49
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,290
The castle guards brought in
a woman named Regina.

50
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,290
They said she was a witch,
but she was too beautiful to be a witch.

51
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,840
I have married Regina.
Everything feels so perfect!

52
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:24,850
Except for Regina's strange looking mirror.
There's something not quite right.

53
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,730
People around the castle have been
disappearing, one by one.

54
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,520
Is it because of that peculiar mirror?

55
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,570
I saw it with my own eyes,
Regina talking to a tree.

56
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,940
She must be a witch!

57
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,296
I should send Snow away to a safer place.

58
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,540
My dear Snow, by the time you read this,
my fate will be uncertain.

59
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,710
She's coming for me now.

60
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,500
I only hope you can find the
Fearless Seven, and ask them for help.

61
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,260
Apples...

62
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,380
... the most suspicious of fruits.

63
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:05,007
Oh,

64
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:08,100
Papa, where are you?

65
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,390
But they don't look dangerous.

66
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,227
Regina?

67
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:34,420
No, my shoes! Get her!

68
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,106
- Can I borrow this?
- Okay.

69
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,130
Thanks!

70
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,730
What?

71
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:05,400
Nooo!!!!!

72
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,540
Short, chubby, and green.

73
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,420
Green is like an ogre.

74
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,670
Blue or yellow could've made us look cute.
And cuddly.

75
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,550
Quit your complaining, Merlin!

76
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,390
I'm figuring out how to take this curse
and kick it where the sun don't shine.

77
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,016
Listen, we need to find the most
beautifullest princess to kiss us,

78
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,048
and we've just about run out of options.

79
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,110
How would a beautiful woman
even see you, Mister Invisible?

80
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,110
- What was that?
- Some kind of bird?

81
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,790
Magic mirror, full of wisdom,

82
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,960
who's the fairest in the Kingdom?

83
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,210
The woman who wears the red shoes.

84
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,186
And side note, wisdom and
kingdom don't really rhyme.

85
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,970
Cut the sass and tell me her name!

86
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,840
How should I know?
I don't get out much.

87
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,180
Well, you are the magic mirror.

88
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:17,866
Magic is just my first name,
it's short for Magichard. Like Richard.

89
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,310
What can you do then?

90
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,900
I just reflect what I see,
the truth. The truth is,

91
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,820
that you should see yourself right now.
Right now!

92
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,320
Watch it.

93
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:38,000
Distribute wanted posters to every town,
village, valley, forth and forge in the kingdom,

94
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,830
and find her!

95
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,340
I feel my power draining.

96
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,300
I don't have much time.
The aging is accelerating.

97
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,720
And only three bumbling
bits of kindling for help.

98
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,930
Perhaps you should recruit another, someone
who stands to gain from your success.

99
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,970
What about this fellow?

100
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,016
Interesting.

101
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,650
Tell me more, Magichard.

102
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,836
Hey hey, Over here! Over here!

103
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,360
See, see. Come! Very quick.

104
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,860
Look at this. Look, look, look.

105
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,990
What is it?

106
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,710
I know a lot about silhouettes,

107
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,096
and I think this shape is a witch.

108
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,540
Let's not jump to conclusions.
Yes, it could be a witch.

109
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,500
...Or

110
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,500
Ya. It's a witch

111
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,590
The witch who cursed us?

112
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,680
Let's catch her and make
her break the spell!

113
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,001
En garde!

114
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:52,950
Wands where I can see 'em, witch!

115
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:02,959
Fraulein!

116
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,000
No No No! Stop!

117
00:10:04,032 --> 00:10:06,340
I get you some revenge!

118
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,300
Beautiful!

119
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,470
I didn't know anyone could be so beautiful.

120
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,100
How did she end up with us?

121
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,336
Hello, dear lady. Welcome to my
home slash command post.

122
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,980
I have six room mates
but my name's on the lease.

123
00:10:30,024 --> 00:10:31,440
I pay the rent.

124
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:36,056
Your home? Oh my gosh,
I am... I am so sorry.

125
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,966
I was starving and...

126
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,990
No need to apologize.

127
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,886
We didn't mean to interrupt
your stolen meal.

128
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,106
If you're still hungry,
I can whip up something simple.

129
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,226
- You see I, marinate the solution and...

130
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,380
Who is that?

131
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:51,709
Uhh...

132
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,970
Who?

133
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,930
Wow. I look so different.

134
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,980
I mean, my face, and my waist,
and my waist and...

135
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:07,100
My waist?

136
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,730
Oh my gosh! What happened to me?

137
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,280
Oh, I must've gotten up so
quickly my back is killing me.

138
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,032
You mean your head, right?

139
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,000
- Do you need help?
- No, I'm fine.

140
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,800
Is that really what I look like?
In the mirror? Do you see the same thing?

141
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,630
You're beautiful, miss.

142
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,340
Like an angel!

143
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,510
Really?

144
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,810
Could it be?

145
00:11:42,008 --> 00:11:43,946
Excuse me, but who are you?

146
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,480
Oh... I'm Snow...

147
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,600
Snot?

148
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,230
No no no no no no.

149
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,520
My name is...

150
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,690
R-Red Shoes.

151
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,990
Yep. It's me. Red Shoes.

152
00:11:58,056 --> 00:12:02,620
Cool name, but, by any chance
would that be Princess Red Shoes?

153
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,426
Of course, she's a princess!

154
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,436
How could she be so beautiful if she weren't?

155
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,370
Obviously! Right, miss?

156
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,420
Obviously, I mean I am a princess.

157
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,920
Who are you guys?

158
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,040
I'm Merlin.

159
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,610
Part time hero, full time romantic.

160
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,736
And this is Jack, Hans, Arthur,
Pino, Noki and Kio.

161
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,350
No way, your names are
the same as the F-Seven.

162
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,206
The Fearless Seven.
I'm looking for them.

163
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,016
Let me guess,
Merlin's your favourite?

164
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,024
No, not really.

165
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,240
No, that Merlin's not your type.

166
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,240
You seem like a Prince Arthur fan to me.

167
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,910
Honestly, none of them are
really my type.

168
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:47,659
Oh.

169
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,580
Well. That's fine.

170
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,008
Because we're not them, we're
actually completely different people.

171
00:12:53,032 --> 00:12:57,816
In no way are we the same guys, put under
a curse, and changed into different forms.

172
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,016
But only if someone looks at us,
It's very complicated.

173
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,080
Right. We're all clear.

174
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,810
So how can I assist you, my fair lady?

175
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,810
I need to find my father,

176
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,810
and I know that the F-Seven can help.

177
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,820
We know the F-Seven very well,
and their schedule is fully booked.

178
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,820
Leave it to me,
I'll find your father within the month.

179
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,466
I can do it in one week.

180
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,216
- Four days! - Three days!

181
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,530
- Two days! - One!

182
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,507
Oomph!

183
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:25,740
I already found your
father like, two weeks ago.

184
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,910
Really?

185
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,976
I just need a few days
to get him across state lines.

186
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,009
I seriously need to find my dad.

187
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:36,460
Hold on. Nobody has seen the F-Seven
in over a year, right?

188
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,920
You're not going to find them now,
we're your best bet.

189
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,680
Wow. No-ones offered to
help me for such a long time.

190
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,826
You guys are awesome

191
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,180
Really? You think we are awesome?

192
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:55,536
Yeah, you guys are caring, and sweet, and...

193
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,400
And not completely hideous to look at?

194
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,780
No, you guys are totally adorable.

195
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,700
I think I hit her too hard.

196
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,620
But she is beautiful.

197
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,250
She can help me break the curse.

198
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,500
Who is coming to my birthday party?

199
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,486
Has Ariel RSVP'd?

200
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,196
She says she can't make it, sir.
She has to wax her legs.

201
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,510
But she's a mermaid!

202
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,736
What about Sleeping Beauty?

203
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,984
Doctor's appointment.

204
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:29,156
- Is she sick?
- Says she has insomnia.

205
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,456
If she's not gonna sleep,
she can come to our party.

206
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,496
What about Rapunzel?

207
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,666
And don't tell me she's
getting her hair done.

208
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,900
Nope. It's something called, uh, book.

209
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,957
Princess Cruise?

210
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:41,126
That's a ship, sir.

211
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,837
Princess Leia?

212
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:43,032
She's a general!

213
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:45,780
I demand glorious guests!

214
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,256
How can I be any more unpopular!

215
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,950
And I don't understand, why?

216
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,266
Greetings, Prince Average.

217
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,840
It's pronounced Avv-vous-rarge.

218
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,340
Sure it is.

219
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:05,236
If you're here for the 'We Love
Our Peasants' group giveaway,

220
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,140
that motion is ended.
Grab your wrinkles and go.

221
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,300
Move along.

222
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,166
Do you think that people would respect you,

223
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:24,056
if you celebrated your birthday with
a beautiful woman on your arm?

224
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,546
Finally, someone talking sense!

225
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,426
This horrible crone gets it!

226
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,120
May I suggest inviting

227
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,710
this young lady?

228
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,556
She's beautiful, when can she get here?

229
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,420
Well, that's up to you.

230
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,130
You see, she's stolen something from me.

231
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:50,220
You find her, bring her along with you,
and you won't look like such a loser,

232
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,520
and I get my shoes back.

233
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,706
Fear not, loyal hag.

234
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,850
I, Prince Average,

235
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,860
shall find this fugitive,
and make her pay for her crimes,

236
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,024
by making her attend my birthday party.

237
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,570
There shall be balloons!

238
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:11,056
I just thought of it.
Let's have a lot of balloons!

239
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,240
What a buffoon.

240
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,800
It looks just like papa.

241
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,220
Papa won't recognise me.

242
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,560
Why won't... why won't these
shoes just come off?

243
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,910
Yes, this is me.

244
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,880
Would you like to join me
in a moisturising mask?

245
00:17:03,032 --> 00:17:06,000
Oh, thanks, oh. But I am...

246
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:07,919
Oh!

247
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,976
So tired.

248
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,300
Are you sure?

249
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,276
It's very important to take
care of your skin.

250
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,300
Positive.

251
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,810
But this is the finest French
recipe meant to hydrate skin.

252
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,520
It is made of French poopee!

253
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,860
Papa?

254
00:17:26,016 --> 00:17:30,360
Hmm. A spell that makes you fall in love.

255
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,110
Oh, there it is.

256
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,740
Merlin! Have you seen my cook book?

257
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,990
Have you checked in the kitchen?

258
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,540
Ah, silly me! The kitchen. Of course!

259
00:17:43,032 --> 00:17:44,960
Now, where was I?

260
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,000
Merlin, have you seen my moisturizer?

261
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,985
- It's nowhere to be... - No!

262
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:54,196
Whatever it is, I haven't seen it.
Now please, go away.

263
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,300
Someone's got anger management issues.

264
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,980
Getting a kiss was never
a problem with this face.

265
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,820
Red Shoes?

266
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,190
Papa?

267
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,610
Papa? Are you there?

268
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,570
Papa?

269
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,810
Boys! I'm telling you. Sweet treats are
the way to a woman's heart.

270
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,336
It works! I call it, an auto portrait.

271
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,992
I call it, the duplicatertron.

272
00:18:49,016 --> 00:18:50,506
I call it, selfie!

273
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,216
Red Shoes must love it!

274
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,716
Monsieur, monsieur.

275
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,410
She doesn't want sweets and selfies.

276
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,910
Women want diamonds.

277
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
Merlin?

278
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:10,210
The Book of Spells To Make You Fall In Love?

279
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,016
Okay, big, terrifying, wooden bunny.

280
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,510
You're a nice bunny.

281
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,520
You're a Vegan bunny, right?

282
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,480
What was that? Lightning?

283
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,110
Actually, it's called magic. I do it.

284
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,400
Really? Then do some!

285
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,150
 Darling...

286
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,200
 Wish you could see what can I see

287
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,500
 Miles ahead just you and me

288
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,880
 To infinity

289
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,976
Keep running, and whatever
you do, don't look back.

290
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,300
But I can't leave without you.

291
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,800
You're looking back. Don't do that.

292
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
But...

293
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,640
Hate to zap you longears,

294
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,310
But I need to impress a beautiful woman.

295
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,666
Big, scary bunny! Over here!

296
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,690
Red! Stop putting yourself in...

297
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,570
...danger...

298
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,040
Arthur! I got you.

299
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,776
It's no use, Red Shoes.

300
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,486
I'm slippin' away. Not much time...

301
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,656
Just... need to... use that core of mine...

302
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,190
I see the light at the end of the funnel.

303
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,916
Time for me to kick the bucket

304
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,956
I had a good run. I was God blessed.

305
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,990
Oh, I used to be able to bench two fifty!

306
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,386
Before I go, how about a farewell kiss?

307
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,450
Red Shoes! Thank goodness you're safe.

308
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,436
Do you need CPR? I'm basically an expert.

309
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,726
And don't worry, I brushed my teeth.

310
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,000
No, No, No. I'm fine, but Arthur, he's stuck.

311
00:21:13,032 --> 00:21:14,516
He tried to save me and...

312
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,000
Would you get up?

313
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,040
What? He's not hurt?

314
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,630
- Only his pride.
- Seriously Arthur?

315
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,180
You need to find a better
way to hit on girls.

316
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,400
Stand back! I may have to risk my life.

317
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,580
Someone call for three inventors?

318
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,200
For three geniuses?

319
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,290
That sounds like us!

320
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,008
Everyone came runnin' to help,
great, just great.

321
00:21:55,032 --> 00:21:56,776
Everyone except Merlin, that is.

322
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,000
Ah! Super, there he is now.

323
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,527
Where have you been?

324
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:03,316
Something awful could've happened
to Red if I hadn't shown up.

325
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,430
You?

326
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,390
Don't even go there!

327
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,930
I saved her first.

328
00:22:11,048 --> 00:22:12,980
- Right?
- I was worried about you.

329
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,048
I was worried about me too.

330
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,206
- But mostly you.
- No-one needs to worry.

331
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,490
Arthur's here. Please, my lady.

332
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,900
Um... Okay.

333
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,250
You shouldn't go into the
forest by yourself.

334
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:38,500
It's a nightmarish landsacpe, fit only for
bloodthirsty warriors like myself.

335
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,040
...And squirrels.

336
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,920
I thought I saw my father.

337
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,340
Turned out, just to be that big bunny.

338
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,510
Well, if you ever make such a dangerous
and weird mistake again,

339
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,850
just know that I can protect you.

340
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,666
This's very kind.

341
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,310
And if you really want to express
your gratitude, you can...

342
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,586
Oh, I am so sorry.

343
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:07,910
This was much slappier than
I intended it to be.

344
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,700
Oh! It happens. No problem.

345
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,660
Maybe an apology kiss then?

346
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,710
Bravo mon ami!

347
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,590
Nice try.

348
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,800
Red Shoes.

349
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:30,040
Gentlemen, to break this curse, we're going
to have to work as a tightly knit team.

350
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,048
Which means, you do everything I say.

351
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,706
- Excuse? - Huh? - What? - No.

352
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,497
You got to be kidding.

353
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:36,770
Hans and Jack will search around the Dismal Lake.

354
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,730
Triplets! You search the Caves Of Despair.

355
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,900
Red Shoe and I, will go to Golden Goose Avenue.

356
00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:47,700
Golden Goose Avenue, which happens
to be your go to place for dates.

357
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,056
We are going to focus on the mission.

358
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,490
And then see where the evening takes us.

359
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:56,960
The only thing you're going to shop for
on Golden Goose Avenue, is rejection.

360
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,670
And you can't even afford that.

361
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,436
I like my odds. You saw what she did.

362
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,800
An expression of affection.

363
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,800
Every woman shows it differently.

364
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,446
You took your shot. You got slapped.

365
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,526
May I remind you

366
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:12,430
that this is the closest thing to a
kiss anyone's had since the curse.

367
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,116
Let's work together to guide
Red Shoes' feelings towards me

368
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,992
so we can break the curse.

369
00:24:19,016 --> 00:24:20,310
What about the rest of us?

370
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,860
After I resume my princely form,

371
00:24:23,016 --> 00:24:25,490
the word about F-Seven will be out.

372
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,280
Ladies will be begging to kiss your green mugs.

373
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,160
- Really?
- Sounds reasonable.

374
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,756
I'll bring the gelato!

375
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,370
Getting one kiss sure is easier
than getting seven.

376
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,346
This is not a plan,
he's just out for himself!

377
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,396
A half baked plan is better than none.

378
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:44,000
Don't worry Merlin,
I have a big assignment for you.

379
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,260
Big assignment?

380
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,760
Here you go. I drew these up last night.

381
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,510
I can't tell if this drawing is terrible, or

382
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,850
really avant garde.

383
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,180
Oh, my neighbor's a great art teacher.

384
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,746
Pablo Picassover?

385
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:02,560
One thing's for sure,
daddy's on the big side...

386
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,730
...of big.

387
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,320
You must take after your mother.

388
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,780
No, I look a lot like papa...Oh!

389
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:16,032
Yeah, my mother. Gosh! We... exactly! Twins!

390
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,726
Alright. You know the plan. Let's move.

391
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,540
Deploy! Thunderdwarfs are go!

392
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,500
And where d'ya think you're going?

393
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,550
Your post is right there.

394
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,220
You'll watch the savage monster.
I call him Vicious!

395
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,800
I call him Woodbottom.

396
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,330
Do not worry Merlin. We'll make
sure you get kissed too.

397
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,760
Eventually.

398
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,576
We'll split up here.

399
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,350
Alright, see you later.

400
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,190
I know exactly where we should
look to find your father.

401
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,940
Really? Where?

402
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,120
Daddy!

403
00:25:56,409 --> 00:25:57,409
Wow!

404
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,596
Is this what I think it is?

405
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:05,670
I present Excalibur, the legendary
sword trapped in this rock for centuries.

406
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:09,436
Waiting for a man of great
strength to release it.

407
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,720
It says 'Do not attempt to remove by force'.

408
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,300
... Oh, right. I guess. Ahem.

409
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,730
The truth is, I realized you were the woman
of my destiny the first time I saw you.

410
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:24,770
I thought if I could show you my strength

411
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:27,230
I would be worthy of your affections.

412
00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:32,149
Oh!

413
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,636
Oops, I'll put it back.

414
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,320
No No No! Can I have it?

415
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,880
Oh, Arthur, it's just beginner's luck.

416
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,470
You want me to, maybe pull
it out for you again?

417
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,970
No, I'm not humiliated at all.

418
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,800
Let's go.

419
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,150
Don't look at me like that,
I'm the real prisoner here.

420
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,490
What? You hungry?

421
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,530
And fetch!

422
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,250
Hop along, big guy!

423
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,210
There's no way Arthur is
breaking this curse alone!

424
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,270
Woah!

425
00:27:48,048 --> 00:27:49,810
Arthur, where're you going?

426
00:27:53,056 --> 00:27:54,056
Okay.

427
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,780
See you later.

428
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:57,950
Hi.

429
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,780
Oh, look at what you made me do!

430
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,910
You...

431
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,330
I'm sorry.

432
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,540
...made me make it perfect.

433
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Thank you.

434
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:08,501
Woah!

435
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,396
I'm so sorry.

436
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,340
No, don't be. I am sorry.

437
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,000
Are you alright?

438
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:17,129
And...

439
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,930
...don't worry about this.

440
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,850
What?

441
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:24,430
Ta-da!

442
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,166
Excuse me, have you seen this man?

443
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,690
 I'm feeling good today

444
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,690
 And nothing standing in my way

445
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,056
 I wouldn't change a thing

446
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,910
 I must have been walking in a dream

447
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,120
 Everybody wants to stop and stare

448
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:48,460
 People talk but I don't care

449
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,790
 Everybody wants to stop and stare

450
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,880
 People talk but I don't care

451
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Don't matter what you think or see

452
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,520
 There's no-one I would rather be

453
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,970
 Take me as I am this is me

454
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,350
 There's no-one I would rather be

455
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:09,149
 It don't matter

456
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,270
 It don't matter to me

457
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,860
 It dont matter

458
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,490
 Take me as I am this is me

459
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,516
Arthur, I was thinking.

460
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,276
What if I just pull out the Excalibur for you?

461
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,800
Our secret.

462
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,736
Really? We have a secret now?

463
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,367
Yeah.

464
00:29:42,391 --> 00:29:45,016
I like a girl who can keep things classified.

465
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,310
Let's find your pops, friend.

466
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,520
'Bye guys.

467
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
What?

468
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,940
Hey, you.

469
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,440
No.

470
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:00,650
Hey!

471
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,280
Stop!

472
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,200
Come on!

473
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,770
Oh, you guys don't have to help.

474
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,000
That's not her. Come on.

475
00:30:41,024 --> 00:30:42,056
Sorry miss.

476
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,506
Red Shoes! Where has she gone?

477
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,306
Where's Red Shoes?

478
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,000
That's what I'd like to know.

479
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,790
Wait a minute.

480
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,476
Who said you could leave your post?

481
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,540
I'm just walking the bunny.

482
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,380
Red Shoes, where are you?

483
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,760
Hey, have you seen this girl?

484
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,656
Look what I found

485
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,980
Oh, those're mine.
Can I, actually have my shoes back?

486
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:20,126
No way. You're not serious, are you?

487
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:23,900
I'm really not in the mood,
Can you just, please give them back to me?

488
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,426
Ha! They won't even fit on you.

489
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,546
They're gonna fit me better
than they fit you.

490
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:29,570
Hey!

491
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,660
Red Shoes!

492
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,580
Guys! Guys, I'm here.

493
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,250
- Red Shoes!
- Red Shoes! Where are you?

494
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,170
Even the hideous dwarfs won't help you.

495
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,470
Those dwarfs are not hideous.

496
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,220
And I don't need anyone to help me.

497
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,116
Freeze! Put the shoes down.

498
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,706
Get on your knees and put
your hands behind your head.

499
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,536
On second thought, they're yours.

500
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,690
There's no need to push me in a corner

501
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,780
Super scary.

502
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,210
Your red shoes, milady.

503
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Thank you.

504
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,880
Excuse me, miss, have we met?

505
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,720
Well, that's kind of a complicated question.

506
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,220
Red Shoes!

507
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,390
Gotta go. Be safe.

508
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,620
Guys!

509
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,750
Where has she gone?

510
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,170
Red Shoes!

511
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,580
Stop!

512
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,460
Hold on!

513
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,040
Wait a minute.

514
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,390
Gotcha now, don't we?

515
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,310
I don't get it.

516
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,440
Now we know how fast a
bunny can hop in a pinch.

517
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,230
Thank you for helping me, Merlin.

518
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,810
A pleasure, milady.

519
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,320
But I also did it for us.

520
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,740
By the way, what is this?

521
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,820
Gosh, it seems silly but...

522
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,950
... It's my shoes

523
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,370
- They're magical.
- I know, they're fabulous.

524
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,976
But why're they after you?

525
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,316
No, my shoes, they're actually made of magic.

526
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,670
Red Shoes!

527
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,000
Are you a criminal?

528
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,130
No, of course not.

529
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,970
I knew a girl this pretty couldn't
possibly be a criminal.

530
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,510
Look, we should head out now,
there could be more guards around any minute.

531
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,640
Don't worry about them,
I've got these bad boys.

532
00:34:00,016 --> 00:34:02,940
This is gonna make it so much
harder to find my dad.

533
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,940
I have an idea!

534
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:15,024
 What a sight what I feel
when I'm looking at you

535
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,990
 Like I see in the sky for
the very first time

536
00:34:19,032 --> 00:34:26,170
 And I want you to know that I've
never seen something so beautiful

537
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:32,220
 In the stars it's a sign that
our worlds could collide

538
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,008
 You and I, side by side

539
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:43,140
 And I want you to know that I've
never seen something so beautiful

540
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,900
Ta-da!

541
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,770
Oh wow!

542
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,320
What do you think?

543
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,490
That is amazing.

544
00:34:58,024 --> 00:34:58,830
Thank you.

545
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:03,620
 This is the start of something so right

546
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:08,630
 Suddenly all of the stars have aligned

547
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,510
 In the right place at the right time

548
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,866
You had a thing on your cheek.

549
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:19,970
Alright, let's go.

550
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,200
- We've been walking for hours.
- And we'll keep walking 'till we find them.

551
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,750
Now we got her.

552
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,630
- Are they gone?
- Shh. Who cares? -

553
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,340
C'mon. Let's go see.

554
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,390
Look at that.

555
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:01,389
- Wow!
- Wow!

556
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,430
Awsome!

557
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,497
Who's that?

558
00:36:03,521 --> 00:36:04,890
It's the girl's father.

559
00:36:05,048 --> 00:36:06,350
But where's the girl?

560
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,520
It says to go to Risky Rock,
so she must be there.

561
00:36:10,016 --> 00:36:11,400
Why Risky Rock?

562
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,756
We should ask the girl.

563
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,150
Perfect! Where's the girl?

564
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,740
It says to go to Risky Rock,
so she must be there.

565
00:36:19,056 --> 00:36:21,330
But, why Risky Rock?

566
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,870
We should ask the girl.

567
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:23,739
Umm...

568
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,926
Where's the girl?

569
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,556
It says to go to Risky Rock,
so she must be there.

570
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,830
But, why Risky Rock?

571
00:36:30,032 --> 00:36:31,250
We should ask the girl.

572
00:36:42,588 --> 00:36:47,188
 This is the start of something so right

573
00:36:47,189 --> 00:36:51,189
 Suddenly all of the stars have aligned

574
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:52,089
Oww!

575
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,820
What was that for?

576
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,876
You, sir, are sabotaging my
relationship with Red Shoes.

577
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,176
What relationship are
you talking about?

578
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,756
Red Shoes and I share a secret.

579
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,740
I would tell you what it is,
but it's a secret.

580
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:08,290
While you're busy keeping secrets,
I'm going to break my curse.

581
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,596
You're nothing without
your spells, magic boy.

582
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,130
And you're nothing without Excalibur.

583
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,736
You're not waiting for someone to
pull it out for you, are you?

584
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,800
How did you know?

585
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,000
Is it true?

586
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,690
Hans, you shouldn't have.

587
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,650
Something sweet, for someone sweeter.

588
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,256
This is spectacular!

589
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,993
Oh, it's nothing.
Just let me know what you want.

590
00:37:46,017 --> 00:37:49,330
Any time, for the rest of your life.
Do you like fondue?

591
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:54,590
Behold! Carved by the finest jewellers
out of all the jewellers I know

592
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,130
which is a lot.

593
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:57,977
Pretty.

594
00:37:58,001 --> 00:38:02,590
And it's yours, Miss Shoes,
yours in exchange for nothing.

595
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,590
Make it a kiss.

596
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,720
That's really sweet Jack,
but I can't accept it.

597
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,786
I don't want your jewells,
only your good intentions.

598
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:13,230
My intentions are more than good,
they're super bonne.

599
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,400
Testing one, two.

600
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,230
Testing one... no, I'm pushing it, you dolt.

601
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,466
Attention! Hideous trolls!

602
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:22,676
Is it dwarfs with an 'f',
or dwarves, with a 'v'?

603
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,240
I want to use whatever's more offensive.

604
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,330
Oh, it's that loser, Prince Average.

605
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,596
I heard that! It's Avv-vous-rarge!

606
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,557
Oh, please.

607
00:38:29,581 --> 00:38:34,976
Inside your amateurs attempt at a facade
of a sham of a travesty of a veneer of a castle

608
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,130
is a gorgeous wanted criminal.

609
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:42,760
I hereby command that all of you exit
the premises and surrender post haste.

610
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,850
Fail to comply, and you will
never see these two again.

611
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,720
You have until three.

612
00:38:49,008 --> 00:38:50,008
One.

613
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,016
Two.

614
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,560
I lied. Charge!

615
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,606
Am I the person you want?

616
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,460
Yes, yes you are.

617
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:22,210
Though I don't know if you're a person
or a vision of beauty, some kind of angelic

618
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:26,220
thing with wings. Angelic wing things?

619
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:30,048
I will come with you,
but only after you release my friends.

620
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,270
Do it. Do it!

621
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:36,048
Now, here's the good news.
It's my birthday!

622
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:39,650
And you are going to be
the belle of the ball.

623
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,440
The invitation sounds great,
really. But...

624
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,780
It wasn't an invitation,
more of an order.

625
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,886
Prepare the lady's carriage.

626
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,466
She said she doesn't want to go, Average.

627
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:52,410
Avv-vous-rarge!

628
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,160
Don't troll me, Troll.

629
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,686
Ah! So rude.

630
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,976
I couldn't agree more.
Subjects these days.

631
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,130
Now. Shall we?

632
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,720
Get her!

633
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,656
You hold off the guards, and
I'll get her out of here.

634
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,720
No, I'm faster. You stay
here and buy us time.

635
00:40:22,056 --> 00:40:22,860
Here's a thought.

636
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:25,240
Stop fighting and fight!

637
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,820
What's the plan?

638
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,346
Rescue Red Shoes.

639
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:32,280
Like the old days, guys.

640
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,280
Arthur!

641
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,450
Can we get this over with?
They're just dwarfs!

642
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,220
Did you guys hear something?

643
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,270
Come on!

644
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,670
Duck!

645
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,130
Hi, guards, are we taking a break?

646
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,356
... well, FYI

647
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,640
They're getting away!

648
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:22,641
No!

649
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,990
Who's throwin' vegetables?

650
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:38,410
Yeah! You just got Merlined!

651
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:47,590
Run!

652
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Jack!

653
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,720
Duck!

654
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,400
I'm so sorry. You alright?

655
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,780
No. I'm not.

656
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:19,490
Gentlemen, he surrenders.

657
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,700
What?

658
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,150
Engines. Full power.

659
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,230
Shields up.

660
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:55,740
Turn on the mini frizzer.

661
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,000
Superhero landing!

662
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,130
Hooray for us!

663
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,550
- We did it!
- It was mostly me.

664
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:20,599
Yeah!

665
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,100
What?

666
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,810
You've got to be kidding.

667
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:29,400
Finally the big guns, thank you.

668
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:30,650
Fire!

669
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:39,950
Fire!

670
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:47,410
Ooh, close.

671
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,540
The cannonball. Not you.

672
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,590
timeout, timeout.
Everyone, timeout.

673
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,276
You almost blew her up, and she can't
come to my party if you blow her up.

674
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,420
Sorry, sir.

675
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,260
Alright. Time back in.

676
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,470
Surrender monsters!

677
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:02,680
No! Wait!

678
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,550
Oh. That's pretty cool.

679
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:46,350
Everyone inside. And hurry!

680
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,740
You messed with the wrong prince.

681
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:05,580
There is nothing average about Avv-vous-rarge.

682
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:09,032
I shall return!

683
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,187
On Tuesday.

684
00:46:10,211 --> 00:46:12,556
No, wait. I'll check my calendar...

685
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:16,670
Thursday, I shall return Thursday!

686
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,300
We'll be ready.

687
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,130
And waiting.

688
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,196
Arrivederci!

689
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,220
Ciao for now!

690
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,040
Bye bye!

691
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,800
You just got dwarfed!

692
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:26,970
Is that better? I think Merlined is better.

693
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,740
You should have seen the look on his big
ugly face when bunny came running at him.

694
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:50,976
That's how you see everything, isn't it?

695
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,290
With my eyes?

696
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,380
You always talk about
what someone looks like.

697
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,960
I do? I wouldn't say that.

698
00:46:58,032 --> 00:47:00,590
But I can't wait for you
to see the real me.

699
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,760
What kind of Merlin is the real you?

700
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,380
You might not believe it,

701
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:08,040
but the real me is famous,
handsome, and even popular.

702
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:11,140
Not short, stumpy and green.

703
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:14,576
Yeah, you're short, stumpy and green, but

704
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,536
you're also a wonderful and charming person.

705
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,056
I'm not explaining it right.

706
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:22,740
If you saw the real me,
you'd know exactly what I mean.

707
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:25,530
I think I can see the real you.

708
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,370
And I like you, just as you are.

709
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,540
That's hilarious.

710
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:36,670
Here, close your eyes,
and imagine the real me.

711
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:39,670
I guarantee you, it'll be different.

712
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:44,970
I do feel something different ..

713
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,180
Really?

714
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,600
But eyes opened or closed

715
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,930
to me you're still Merlin.

716
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:56,850
Now tell me, who am I to you?

717
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,980
You're a gift.

718
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:03,320
A gift that'll transform me
into someone amazing.

719
00:48:04,024 --> 00:48:06,110
Just like you're amazing.

720
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:17,420
Actually, I want to show you something too.

721
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,420
You need a hand?

722
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:26,930
Hold on. Nope. Stand back. I got this.

723
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:29,116
...One...

724
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,890
Two, yeah, okay, I need help.

725
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:50,699
Woah. Woah woah woah.

726
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,490
No thankyou.

727
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:01,750
You know what the weird thing is?
They're super comfortable.

728
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,356
Y'know, I'm just saying. Where were
you when the facade was falling?

729
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,510
I mean, that was terrifying.

730
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,430
What're you doing here?

731
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:16,350
I have come for my shoes.

732
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:21,016
Well, I had them. I mean I saw them.
But those dwarfs!

733
00:49:21,048 --> 00:49:23,570
It's dwarves with a 'v'.
So you failed?

734
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:28,280
I did not fail, I took a timeout.

735
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,386
Yeah. This is a calculated timeout.

736
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:32,530
I'm going to return on Thursday,
we all pencilled it in.

737
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:33,660
Silence!

738
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:35,450
Have a bite.

739
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,450
For strength.

740
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:42,306
Apples, the most suspicious of fruits.

741
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:45,000
I don't have much time, Prince.

742
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:49,300
You could still have the
best birthday ever,

743
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:50,946
But remember...

744
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:57,600
What's bad for me,
will be very bad for you.

745
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:04,690
She's gone.

746
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,190
Ah! What's the worst that could happen.

747
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,240
It's kind of sweet.

748
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:30,510
Don't move.

749
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:31,197
Okay.

750
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:33,316
Pino, Noki Kio, show us what you got.

751
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:34,276
Okey doky!

752
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,117
Here we go!

753
00:50:35,141 --> 00:50:36,260
Our pleasure.

754
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,024
... here we go, yeah, a little

755
00:50:46,048 --> 00:50:47,190
Oooh a little over here!

756
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,726
Now that looks like a real home.

757
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,710
Yep. I could get used to that.

758
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,130
Uh uh. I cannot.

759
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,800
It's a perfect copy of my drawing.
That's incredible.

760
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,390
Let me try.

761
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,920
This will definitely make it easier to
find your dad.

762
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:24,286
Unfortunately, this thing aint flying.

763
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:25,167
It's grounded.

764
00:51:25,191 --> 00:51:26,206
Why does it need to fly?

765
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:28,980
The posters are no good if we
can't distribute them fast.

766
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:33,150
Guys, thankyou so much for
everything you're doing.

767
00:51:33,651 --> 00:51:35,651
- My pleasure.
- It's nice.

768
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:46,270
Opening doors!

769
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:05,540
You know Merlin, I feel so
lucky that I've met you.

770
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,120
I feel the same way.

771
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,880
I feel like anything is possible.

772
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:14,687
 Darling

773
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:20,220
 Come on out there and take my hand

774
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:24,350
 I will show you that I'm your man

775
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:27,350
 Is that okay

776
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,270
Merlin! Watch out!

777
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,700
Merlin.

778
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:45,580
Merlin.

779
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:47,870
Merlin!

780
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:49,790
Everything okay?

781
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:51,420
Of course! Sure!

782
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:53,476
Nothing to be embarrassed about.

783
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:57,736
So why are we even talking about
that when we should be going...

784
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,760
this direction.

785
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,920
Hey wait!

786
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,560
So, about these magic shoes.

787
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,946
Why, are they still bothering you?

788
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:09,980
What kind of magic do
those shoes have?

789
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:13,350
Well .. how do I put this.

790
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,320
Merlin, I used to be strong, really strong.

791
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:19,966
And, I was always proud of that.

792
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:25,056
But, the shoes magic, umm,
it made me a little dainty?

793
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,216
Sorry to hear.

794
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,540
The shoes made me lose
a little bit of weight.

795
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:31,976
It could be worse.

796
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,330
..Okay.

797
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:35,920
- A lot of weight.
- Ah.

798
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,130
Well, I know what it's like to look different on
the outside from what you feel on the inside.

799
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,850
Merlin, I'd like to give you a
token of my appreciation.

800
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:53,270
Oh, here, hand me one of your spells.

801
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:53,993
Why?

802
00:54:54,017 --> 00:54:56,650
Oh, come on. I'm not going to zap you.

803
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:58,860
Give me a second.

804
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:15,170
There. Consider it your good luck charm.

805
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:19,710
Thank you.

806
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:30,048
Merlin, do you think we'd be happier

807
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:32,560
if we were our old selves again?

808
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:35,480
Yep. Yep, yep. Definately we would.

809
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:36,900
I don't know.

810
00:55:38,016 --> 00:55:39,610
I like how we are.

811
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,740
Right here, just, right now.

812
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,120
Even if I'm an ugly green monster?

813
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:53,200
I don't care about your height
or what colour you are.

814
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,670
And that's the way you feel about me, right?

815
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:00,920
Yes, of course. I mean, duhh!

816
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:06,380
I think we're both just trapped
under the same spell.

817
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:28,780
Wait. Keep your eyes closed
and don't open them until I say.

818
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:31,024
When you open your eyes there will be...

819
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,926
a handsome man in front of you.

820
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:35,436
Someone worthy of you.

821
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,670
Someone you'd be proud to be seen with.

822
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,032
I think you're right.

823
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,670
Ready? And...

824
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,170
Oh, it's such a good day to break a curse!

825
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,680
Now!

826
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,300
Ta-da!

827
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:54,470
You just got Merlined!

828
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,850
What do you think?

829
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:59,520
Mission impossibly handsome, right?

830
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:04,650
Oh, it's okay,
I know this is a lot to take in.

831
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,546
But you can let your happiness flag fly.

832
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:11,490
This, this is the real me.

833
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:14,490
- It's stupid.
- What?

834
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,870
Wait a minute!

835
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:19,870
My hands are still green sausages.

836
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,170
No! I look the same.

837
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:25,960
Yes, impossibly handsome.

838
00:57:26,008 --> 00:57:28,170
This doesn't make sense.

839
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,300
You're the most beautiful woman in
the world, why do I look the same?

840
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:33,446
What're you talking about, Merlin?

841
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:34,890
Do I need a longer kiss?

842
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:36,350
Two kisses?

843
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:38,810
Let's try again.

844
00:57:39,349 --> 00:57:40,349
Umm.

845
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:41,770
You're not making any sense.

846
00:57:51,024 --> 00:57:52,024
Hurry!

847
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
What is that?

848
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,870
This kingdom has a serious
monster problem.

849
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,327
Are you alright?

850
00:58:14,351 --> 00:58:16,260
No. I'm not.

851
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:25,400
Thank you.

852
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,690
Pleasure, milady.

853
00:58:29,056 --> 00:58:30,056
Watch out!

854
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:49,710
Ha-hah! Yes!

855
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,286
What do they want,
besides smashing us?

856
00:58:58,310 --> 00:58:59,310
I don't know!

857
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,860
The old me would've nailed that.

858
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:19,740
You just got Merlined!

859
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:31,710
Hurry!

860
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,586
Red, close your eyes.

861
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:50,456
This is no time for kissing, Merlin.

862
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,610
Trust me. Close your eyes.

863
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,490
Please, close them!

864
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,580
That was too close.

865
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:03,790
Don't look at me.

866
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:05,976
You see that tree on the
other side of the bridge?

867
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,597
Yeah.

868
01:00:06,621 --> 01:00:09,646
On my signal, run towards
it as fast as you can.

869
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:11,170
No, I can't leave you here.

870
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:14,550
You have to.
And don't look back, okay?

871
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,120
Look right at that tree until I say it's safe.

872
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:18,816
Promise you won't look.

873
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,310
Okay. I promise.

874
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:22,890
Now!

875
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,396
What?

876
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:57,720
You just got Merlined?
Oh. Yes you did.

877
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,460
Hey! Locate!

878
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,250
Hey, locate here!

879
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:34,590
You're even more of a blockhead
than Prince Average.

880
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,260
Avv-vous-rarge!

881
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:41,040
Prince Average?

882
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,860
You just got Merlined.

883
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:03,780
Take a look, Red Shoes.

884
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:04,677
Merlin!

885
01:02:04,701 --> 01:02:07,160
I have triumphantly saved the day.

886
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:09,330
Merlin, no!

887
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:13,032
Merlin!

888
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,170
Merlin!

889
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:25,490
Snow White?

890
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,670
Snow White?

891
01:03:37,032 --> 01:03:39,880
The thief was Snow White
this whole time?

892
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:43,470
Interesting. She could remove the shoes.

893
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:47,720
You're going after her yourself?

894
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,350
What? Were you going to go?

895
01:03:50,048 --> 01:03:52,560
I get it! I don't have legs.

896
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:58,520
So, here I am.

897
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:00,770
All the real me.

898
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,820
I bet you're disappointed, huh?

899
01:04:04,024 --> 01:04:07,086
You're the girl from Golden Goose Avenue.

900
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:07,677
Red Shoes!

901
01:04:07,701 --> 01:04:11,032
That's not my name, it's Snow White.

902
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,676
Princess Snow White? So your father is...

903
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,120
King White, yeah.

904
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:20,032
By the time I figured out his
new wife Regina was a witch

905
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,880
he'd already disappeared.

906
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:25,946
And the monsters who attacked us

907
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:29,970
were sent by my stepmother
to get these shoes.

908
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:34,220
I guess being beautiful is really
worth that much to her.

909
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:37,480
Have you thought about
just giving them back?

910
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,110
And give up their magic?

911
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:44,900
If I'd given up their magic, you wouldn't
have helped me find my father, would you?

912
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:47,200
Would you?

913
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,480
I thought we were both
under the same spell.

914
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:58,000
But I see now that I was wrong.

915
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:03,920
Listen, I can't get into all the details,
but I'm under a curse too.

916
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:06,260
You still don't get it, Merlin.

917
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,970
I'm not talking about our curses.

918
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:13,470
Merlin, I'm talking about
the kind of spell

919
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,770
you never want to break.

920
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,990
He likes you more than he likes me.

921
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:43,230
What would've happened if she'd taken
off her shoes that day in the barn?

922
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:44,690
You think that's important?

923
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,032
I just wonder,

924
01:06:49,056 --> 01:06:52,024
what I would've done if I'd
seen the real Snow White.

925
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:53,660
Seriously?

926
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:56,024
It's still all about appearance for you.

927
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,950
No! Not exactly.

928
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:02,790
But I can't live looking like
you for the rest of my life

929
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:07,250
Kind of proving my point, other me.
Alright. Let's try this.

930
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:10,420
Who do you like more,
Snow White or Red Shoes?

931
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:12,510
Easy, it's Red Shoes.

932
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:15,340
Now, which of us do you
think Red Shoes likes more?

933
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:17,140
Easy, it's me!

934
01:07:19,048 --> 01:07:21,680
Wait. No.

935
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:23,440
It's...

936
01:07:23,810 --> 01:07:24,850
you.

937
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:51,670
 You came in my life in a high flash of lightning

938
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:56,720
 I covered my eyes but there's no use in hiding

939
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:00,890
 This feeling has stuck and I couldn't say

940
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:02,220
You're a gift.

941
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,222
A gift that'll transform me

942
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:06,576
into someone amazing.

943
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:11,320
 This is the start of something so right

944
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:16,360
 Suddenly all of the stars have aligned

945
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:21,410
 In the right place at the right time

946
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:26,750
 This is the start of something so right

947
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:31,550
Well, I know what it's like to look different on
the outside to what we feel on the inside.

948
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:37,000
 This is the start of something so right

949
01:08:42,008 --> 01:08:49,690
 This is the start of something so right

950
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:52,520
Look at that!

951
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,256
The shoes. You're wearing them.

952
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,990
I thought you left.

953
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,740
You should take them off again.

954
01:09:09,032 --> 01:09:10,032
I can't.

955
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:13,800
You just had to make things complicated.

956
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,220
Maybe this will help.

957
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:18,776
Eat the apple, and they'll slide right off.

958
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:19,930
Where did you get that?

959
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:22,510
I want to help you, Snow White.

960
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:23,760
Please.

961
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,440
Red Shoes?

962
01:09:32,016 --> 01:09:33,016
Merlin?

963
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:34,940
Merlin?

964
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:40,240
What terrible timing you have.

965
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,240
We're gonna have to do this the hard way.

966
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:46,950
Regina?

967
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:53,340
Such a tender family reunion.

968
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:55,800
So sad we can't stay!

969
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:57,710
Red Shoes!

970
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:02,116
Come on, let's go, longears.

971
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:03,696
Hey! Wait for us!

972
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,760
How 'bout you go back
and get the others?

973
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:07,890
And make lots of copies of this.

974
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,480
Let's go!

975
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:13,336
We can do this.

976
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,360
Yeah!

977
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:19,240
Your power my lady. It has drained you.

978
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:23,200
You think? I don't need
you to tell me how I look.

979
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:25,596
I'm a mirror. It's what I do.

980
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:28,516
M - I - R - O - R.
I can't spell.

981
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:29,540
Enough.

982
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:31,960
Bind her.

983
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,130
It's snack time.

984
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,970
How can you sleep at
a time like this?

985
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:45,326
I'm not supposed to talk
when I have this on,

986
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:48,770
but I got to ask.
Do you think they've kissed yet?

987
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:49,850
I hope so,

988
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:52,890
because it'll feel better to
punch Merlin when he's pretty.

989
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:57,296
We've been waiting for a...
Where have you been?

990
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,336
Did you break the curse yet?

991
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:00,024
Merlin, are you hungry?

992
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,360
Those are bears.

993
01:11:01,399 --> 01:11:02,399
Ah...

994
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,280
Hi? This is from Merlin.

995
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,640
Wow! This is so cool.

996
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:30,890
Okay, sword.

997
01:11:31,048 --> 01:11:35,850
If you think you've humiliated, embarrassed,
and otherwise frustrated me,

998
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,520
you're right.

999
01:11:38,016 --> 01:11:41,690
But that ends now!

1000
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:53,330
Oh, zut alors. Please end this.

1001
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:09,076
Hey! Wait! You're running the wrong way.

1002
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,430
The castle's over there.

1003
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,360
Sit.

1004
01:12:40,032 --> 01:12:43,840
Eat this darling, and you'll
get your freedom.

1005
01:12:44,008 --> 01:12:45,340
Where is my father?

1006
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,040
Royal loyal little girl,
pining for her papa?

1007
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:54,720
This is getting a little boring, so I need
you to take a bite, and I'll tell you.

1008
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:56,270
I won't let you win.

1009
01:12:56,690 --> 01:13:00,150
You've torn apart my family,
and you will not get away with it, Regina.

1010
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:04,056
Ooh, I'm so scared, Snow.

1011
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,280
Very well. A different approach.

1012
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:16,950
- Merlin!
- No!

1013
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:19,960
Eat the apple, or watch him die.

1014
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:21,009
That's your choice.

1015
01:13:21,033 --> 01:13:22,936
Don't do it. No!

1016
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,840
No!

1017
01:13:26,299 --> 01:13:27,299
Red Shoes!

1018
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:29,550
Promise to me, you'll let him go.

1019
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:33,040
Oh absolutely.
When the third bell chimes,

1020
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:36,140
everything will be just
like it used to be.

1021
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:38,560
No! No no no.

1022
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:42,560
Save my papa for me.

1023
01:13:53,039 --> 01:13:54,539
Red Shoes!

1024
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:13,970
A legendary handsome knight,
fearless rescuer of princesses.

1025
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:19,180
Sitting in a tree,
not getting K - I - S - I - N - G - D.

1026
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:22,016
Burn. I can't spell.

1027
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,836
You don't have to do this.

1028
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:27,940
Just take the shoes and let us go.

1029
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:31,150
I wish. They're made of pure magic apple.

1030
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,296
The fruit of temptation and want.
They feed on your desires

1031
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:38,790
Once they give you what you desire,
the bond is permanent.

1032
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,250
That's not true. She took
them off in the river.

1033
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:43,008
That doesn't make any sense.

1034
01:14:43,032 --> 01:14:47,670
How could she possibly want to save you
more than she wanted to be beautiful?

1035
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,008
What did you do to her?

1036
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:52,180
Did you cast a spell?

1037
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:55,866
What's going to happen to her?

1038
01:14:55,890 --> 01:15:00,826
Well, once she eats the apple, its magic
will turn her into a magic apple tree.

1039
01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:03,940
The first bell, nothing really happens,
but very dramatic.

1040
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:06,456
The tree bears fruit,
and the second bell...

1041
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,690
Oh! Excitement mounts!

1042
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:10,900
The morning sun touches the fruit

1043
01:15:11,056 --> 01:15:13,636
turning it into a new
pair of red shoes

1044
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:16,620
And number three, the circle of life!

1045
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:17,990
And then what?

1046
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:21,620
Regina will be the most
beautiful person in the kingdom.

1047
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:22,937
Forever.

1048
01:15:22,961 --> 01:15:25,830
I don't care about her,
what about Snow White?

1049
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,236
The tree withers and dies,
and so does Snow White.

1050
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:32,040
No!

1051
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:33,880
Yes!

1052
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:38,430
Oh, I'm rotten! I'm dying.

1053
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:58,160
Why don't you come back and play?

1054
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:05,870
Not so fast.

1055
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:16,760
It's gonna hurt.

1056
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:23,480
Oh yeah! Stretch it out.

1057
01:16:35,079 --> 01:16:36,279
Uh-oh.

1058
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:41,740
Smoke! Smoke!

1059
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:43,926
We're here, bitch. Are you okay?

1060
01:16:43,950 --> 01:16:45,410
Yeah.

1061
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I never thought I'd say this,

1062
01:16:48,710 --> 01:16:51,000
but I'm so glad to be chubby
and green again.

1063
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:55,008
Seven to one.
I like those odds.

1064
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:56,260
Let's go.

1065
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:00,220
We like those odds even better.

1066
01:17:03,048 --> 01:17:04,810
Are you up to this, muchacho?

1067
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:08,350
You finally pulled out Excalibur.

1068
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:12,626
Oh, yes, yes. I did it.
That's exactly how it went down.

1069
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:14,900
Here you go Merlin.
You're gonna need these.

1070
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:15,940
Thanks.

1071
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:23,950
Here comes the sun.

1072
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:26,250
Now let's all get dwarfed.

1073
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:34,670
Ah, this is where your
fairy tale ends, trolls.

1074
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:40,300
You missed.

1075
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:18,920
Au revoir, mirror!

1076
01:18:34,016 --> 01:18:35,270
Finally.

1077
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:46,660
It's a good day to break a curse.

1078
01:18:48,330 --> 01:18:50,540
Eternal Beauty.

1079
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:04,760
I'm sorry

1080
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:06,640
Snow White.

1081
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:12,940
Ahhh!

1082
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,670
Extraordinary! No more carrots for me.

1083
01:19:49,048 --> 01:19:50,025
Woah! We're back!

1084
01:19:50,049 --> 01:19:51,100
Yippee!

1085
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:02,530
Papa?

1086
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:14,032
Snow White?

1087
01:20:16,330 --> 01:20:17,420
Oh papa!

1088
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:18,540
Snow!

1089
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:24,800
Wait.

1090
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:26,220
Where's Merlin?

1091
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:28,008
I'm so sorry.

1092
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:32,430
He sacrificed himself to stop Regina.

1093
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:34,560
Merlin, no!

1094
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,150
Merlin!

1095
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:41,290
I thought you were gone.

1096
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:46,420
You're the most beautiful
woman in the world.

1097
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:50,760
With my eyes open

1098
01:21:52,510 --> 01:21:53,970
or closed.

1099
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:06,270
No.

1100
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:25,500
I got Merlined.

1101
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:52,320
You're a prince, Merlin.

1102
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:02,580
Yeah, that Merlin.

1103
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
The one who's not really your type.

1104
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,340
I kind of liked the short
and green Merlin.

1105
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,310
But I'm still that Merlin inside.

1106
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:21,016
Yes, yes you are.

1107
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:41,200
Any idea who that girl is?

1108
01:23:53,001 --> 01:23:55,201
 I'm feeling good today

1109
01:23:56,402 --> 01:23:58,902
 Aint nothing standing in my way

1110
01:23:58,903 --> 01:24:01,103
 I wouldn't change a thing

1111
01:24:01,104 --> 01:24:04,604
 I must get hot walking in a dream

1112
01:24:04,605 --> 01:24:08,105
 Everybody wants to stop and stare

1113
01:24:08,106 --> 01:24:11,106
 People talk but I don't care

1114
01:24:11,107 --> 01:24:14,607
 Everybody wants to stop and stare

1115
01:24:14,608 --> 01:24:17,608
 People talk but I don't care

1116
01:24:17,609 --> 01:24:20,609
 Don't matter what you think or see

1117
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:23,610
 There's no-one I would rather be

1118
01:24:23,611 --> 01:24:26,611
 Take me as I am this is me

1119
01:24:26,612 --> 01:24:29,612
 There's no-one I would rather be

1120
01:24:30,613 --> 01:24:32,413
 It don't matter

1121
01:24:33,414 --> 01:24:35,614
 It don't matter to me

1122
01:24:36,515 --> 01:24:38,315
 It don't matter

1123
01:24:38,316 --> 01:24:41,316
 Take me as I am this is me

1124
01:24:41,317 --> 01:24:43,317
 I learned to let it go

1125
01:24:44,418 --> 01:24:46,218
 'Cause I'm comfortable

1126
01:24:47,219 --> 01:24:49,019
 In my own skin

1127
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:52,520
 I learned to dance in the suits I'm in

1128
01:24:52,521 --> 01:24:56,021
 Everybody wants to stop and stare

1129
01:24:56,022 --> 01:24:59,022
 People talk but I don't care

1130
01:24:59,023 --> 01:25:02,223
 Everybody wants to stop and stare

1131
01:25:02,224 --> 01:25:05,224
 People talk but I don't care

1132
01:25:05,225 --> 01:25:08,225
 Don't matter what you think or see

1133
01:25:08,226 --> 01:25:11,226
 There's no-one I would rather be

1134
01:25:11,227 --> 01:25:14,227
 Take me as I am this is me

1135
01:25:14,228 --> 01:25:17,228
 There's no-one I would rather be

1136
01:25:18,829 --> 01:25:20,329
 It don't matter

1137
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:23,830
 It don't matter to me

1138
01:25:24,831 --> 01:25:26,331
 It don't matter

1139
01:25:26,332 --> 01:25:29,332
 Take me as I am this is me

1140
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:32,333
 I'm comfortable in my own skin

1141
01:25:32,334 --> 01:25:35,334
 Learn to dance in suits I'm in

1142
01:25:35,335 --> 01:25:36,835
 I'm comfortable...

1143
01:25:54,436 --> 01:25:55,636
Huh?

1144
01:26:05,537 --> 01:26:07,737
Ooh. Not Again!
