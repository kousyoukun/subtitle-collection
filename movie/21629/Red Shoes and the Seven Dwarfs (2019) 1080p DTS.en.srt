1
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,675
This, is Fairy Tale Island.

2
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:31,258
A magical land of princes and princesses

3
00:00:31,758 --> 00:00:33,467
witches and monsters.

4
00:00:34,383 --> 00:00:38,800
Accidents and strange events
happen all the time.

5
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:41,342
And that's when people call us.

6
00:00:41,717 --> 00:00:46,425
The Fearless Seven, the greatest
heroes on Fairy Tale Island.

7
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:48,758
Especially me, Merlin.

8
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:53,383
But everything changed
the day we defeated a dragon

9
00:00:53,592 --> 00:00:55,300
and saved a Princess.

10
00:00:56,967 --> 00:01:01,092
We thought we'd saved a witch,
so, we attacked her.

11
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,300
But we were wrong.

12
00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:08,258
She wasn't a witch, she was a princess.

13
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,633
The Fairy Princess!

14
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:13,526
How were we supposed to know?
She looks like a witch,

15
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,675
and everyone knows that a
princess doesn't look like a witch.

16
00:01:17,717 --> 00:01:22,258
Anyways, she wanted to teach us a lesson,
so she put a curse on us.

17
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:24,425
And this was a nasty one.

18
00:01:24,592 --> 00:01:29,008
That turned us into little ugly green
monsters whenever people looked at us.

19
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:31,300
And the only way to break the curse

20
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:35,342
is to get a kiss from the
most beautiful woman in the world.

21
00:01:35,883 --> 00:01:37,675
Are you kidding me?

22
00:01:37,758 --> 00:01:39,425
With this face?

23
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:28,217
Hello, your majesty.

24
00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:31,092
- Good morning ma'am.
- Good morning ma'am.

25
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:38,967
Magic tree, magic tree...

26
00:02:39,217 --> 00:02:45,050
Let this morning be the time
that you perform your duty,

27
00:02:50,342 --> 00:02:58,342
of bringing me the shoes
of youthful eternal... beauty.

28
00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:07,592
Yes!

29
00:03:08,883 --> 00:03:10,592
Change me!

30
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:14,425
Finally!

31
00:03:19,342 --> 00:03:21,467
Not again! How long must I wait?

32
00:03:21,592 --> 00:03:23,276
- No.
- Clear these away.

33
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,068
Uh-oh.

34
00:03:24,092 --> 00:03:24,883
Heads off.

35
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,633
Pull yourself together.

36
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:31,467
Here you are.

37
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,425
Oh? Thanks!

38
00:03:57,842 --> 00:04:01,092
That wasn't here before.
What is she up to now?

39
00:04:20,883 --> 00:04:21,883
Huh?

40
00:04:42,592 --> 00:04:43,592
Huh?

41
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:48,925
You weren't here before.

42
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,550
Whatever.

43
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:00,508
Oh! Oww!

44
00:05:04,675 --> 00:05:05,675
Yes!

45
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,217
I can't believe my beloved daughter
Snow White has turned eighteen.

46
00:05:13,383 --> 00:05:19,092
I only wish her mother could see the kind of
smart and beautiful young woman she's become.

47
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:22,550
Strange thing happened during the party.

48
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:26,467
The castle guards brought in
a woman named Regina.

49
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:32,467
They said she was a witch,
but she was too beautiful to be a witch.

50
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,008
I have married Regina.
Everything feels so perfect!

51
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:44,008
Except for Regina's strange looking mirror.
There's something not quite right.

52
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:48,883
People around the castle have been
disappearing, one by one.

53
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,675
Is it because of that peculiar mirror?

54
00:05:51,758 --> 00:05:56,717
I saw it with my own eyes,
Regina talking to a tree.

55
00:05:56,758 --> 00:05:59,092
She must be a witch!

56
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:03,425
I should send Snow away to a safer place.

57
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:08,675
My dear Snow, by the time you read this,
my fate will be uncertain.

58
00:06:09,008 --> 00:06:10,842
She's coming for me now.

59
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:15,633
I only hope you can find the
Fearless Seven, and ask them for help.

60
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,383
Apples...

61
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:21,508
the most suspicious of fruits.

62
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,110
Oh,

63
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,217
Papa, where are you?

64
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:32,508
But they don't look dangerous.

65
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,300
Regina?

66
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:53,508
No, my shoes! Get her!

67
00:07:02,842 --> 00:07:04,175
- Can I borrow this?
- Okay.

68
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:05,217
Thanks!

69
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:20,800
What?

70
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:24,467
Nooo!

71
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,592
Short, chubby, and green.

72
00:07:35,842 --> 00:07:37,467
Green is like an ogre.

73
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:40,717
Blue or yellow could've made us look cute.
And cuddly.

74
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,592
Quit your complaining, Merlin!

75
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:47,425
I'm figuring out how to take this curse
and kick it where the sun don't shine.

76
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:52,050
Listen, we need to find the most
beautifullest princess to kiss us,

77
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:54,092
and we've just about run out of options.

78
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:59,133
How would a beautiful woman
even see you, Mister Invisible?

79
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:04,133
- What was that?
- Some kind of bird?

80
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:11,800
Magic mirror, full of wisdom,

81
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,967
who's the fairest in the Kingdom?

82
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,217
The woman who wears the red shoes.

83
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,175
And side note, wisdom and
kingdom don't really rhyme.

84
00:08:23,217 --> 00:08:26,967
Cut the sass and tell me her name!

85
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:29,842
How should I know?
I don't get out much.

86
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:32,175
Well, you are the magic mirror.

87
00:08:32,342 --> 00:08:36,842
Magic is just my first name,
it's short for Magichard. Like Richard.

88
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,300
What can you do then?

89
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:43,883
I just reflect what I see,
the truth. The truth is,

90
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:48,800
that you should see yourself right now.
Right now!

91
00:08:50,217 --> 00:08:51,300
Watch it.

92
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:56,967
Distribute wanted posters to every town,
village, valley, forth and forge in the kingdom,

93
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:58,800
and find her!

94
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:02,300
I feel my power draining.

95
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:06,258
I don't have much time.
The aging is accelerating.

96
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,675
And only three bumbling
bits of kindling for help.

97
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,883
Perhaps you should recruit another, someone
who stands to gain from your success.

98
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:15,925
What about this fellow?

99
00:09:16,758 --> 00:09:18,967
Interesting.

100
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:23,592
Tell me more, Magichard.

101
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:26,758
Hey hey, Over here! Over here!

102
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,300
See, see. Come! Very quick.

103
00:09:28,342 --> 00:09:29,800
Look at this. Look, look, look.

104
00:09:30,925 --> 00:09:31,925
What is it?

105
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:38,633
I know a lot about silhouettes,

106
00:09:38,842 --> 00:09:41,008
and I think this shape is a witch.

107
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,467
Let's not jump to conclusions.
Yes, it could be a witch.

108
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,425
Or

109
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,425
Ya. It's a witch

110
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,508
The witch who cursed us?

111
00:09:48,592 --> 00:09:50,592
Let's catch her and make
her break the spell!

112
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:09,883
En garde!

113
00:10:09,925 --> 00:10:11,842
Wands where I can see 'em, witch!

114
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:21,819
Fraulein!

115
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:22,883
No No No! Stop!

116
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:25,217
I get you some revenge!

117
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:30,175
Beautiful!

118
00:10:30,508 --> 00:10:33,342
I didn't know anyone could be so beautiful.

119
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,967
How did she end up with us?

120
00:10:42,383 --> 00:10:46,175
Hello, dear lady. Welcome to my
home slash command post.

121
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:48,842
I have six room mates
but my name's on the lease.

122
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:50,300
I pay the rent.

123
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:54,883
Your home? Oh my gosh,
I am... I am so sorry.

124
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,800
I was starving and...

125
00:10:56,842 --> 00:10:58,842
No need to apologize.

126
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,717
We didn't mean to interrupt
your stolen meal.

127
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:04,925
If you're still hungry,
I can whip up something simple.

128
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:07,050
- You see I, marinate the solution and...

129
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:08,217
Who is that?

130
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,527
Uhh...

131
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:11,800
Who?

132
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:21,758
Wow. I look so different.

133
00:11:22,092 --> 00:11:24,800
I mean, my face, and my waist,
and my waist and...

134
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:25,925
My waist?

135
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,550
Oh my gosh! What happened to me?

136
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:39,092
Oh, I must've gotten up so
quickly my back is killing me.

137
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:41,842
You mean your head, right?

138
00:11:42,383 --> 00:11:45,800
- Do you need help?
- No, I'm fine.

139
00:11:49,383 --> 00:11:53,592
Is that really what I look like?
In the mirror? Do you see the same thing?

140
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:55,425
You're beautiful, miss.

141
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,133
Like an angel!

142
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,300
Really?

143
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:00,592
Could it be?

144
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,717
Excuse me, but who are you?

145
00:12:02,758 --> 00:12:04,258
Oh... I'm Snow...

146
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:05,383
Snot?

147
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:07,008
No no no no no no.

148
00:12:08,467 --> 00:12:10,300
My name is...

149
00:12:11,092 --> 00:12:12,467
R-Red Shoes.

150
00:12:13,883 --> 00:12:16,758
Yep. It's me. Red Shoes.

151
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,383
Cool name, but, by any chance
would that be Princess Red Shoes?

152
00:12:21,425 --> 00:12:23,175
Of course, she's a princess!

153
00:12:23,217 --> 00:12:26,175
How could she be so
beautiful if she weren't?

154
00:12:26,217 --> 00:12:28,133
Obviously! Right, miss?

155
00:12:28,217 --> 00:12:31,175
Obviously, I mean I am a princess.

156
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,675
Who are you guys?

157
00:12:33,717 --> 00:12:35,800
I'm Merlin.

158
00:12:35,883 --> 00:12:38,342
Part time hero, full time romantic.

159
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:42,467
And this is Jack, Hans, Arthur,
Pino, Noki and Kio.

160
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:46,092
No way, your names are
the same as the F-Seven.

161
00:12:46,217 --> 00:12:48,925
The Fearless Seven.
I'm looking for them.

162
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:51,758
Let me guess,
Merlin's your favourite?

163
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:54,758
No, not really.

164
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,967
No, that Merlin's not your type.

165
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,967
You seem like a Prince Arthur fan to me.

166
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:03,633
Honestly, none of them are
really my type.

167
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:06,360
Oh.

168
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:08,300
Well. That's fine.

169
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:11,717
Because we're not them, we're
actually completely different people.

170
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:16,508
In no way are we the same guys, put under
a curse, and changed into different forms.

171
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,717
But only if someone looks at us,
It's very complicated.

172
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:20,758
Right. We're all clear.

173
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,508
So how can I assist you, my fair lady?

174
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,508
I need to find my father,

175
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:28,508
and I know that the F-Seven can help.

176
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:33,508
We know the F-Seven very well,
and their schedule is fully booked.

177
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:36,508
Leave it to me,
I'll find your father within the month.

178
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,133
I can do it in one week.

179
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,883
- Four days!
- Three days!

180
00:13:39,925 --> 00:13:41,217
- Two days!
- One!

181
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,175
Oomph!

182
00:13:42,217 --> 00:13:44,425
I already found your
father like, two weeks ago.

183
00:13:44,508 --> 00:13:45,592
Really?

184
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:48,633
I just need a few days
to get him across state lines.

185
00:13:48,675 --> 00:13:50,675
I seriously need to find my dad.

186
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:55,133
Hold on. Nobody has seen the F-Seven
in over a year, right?

187
00:13:55,258 --> 00:13:58,592
You're not going to find them now,
we're your best bet.

188
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:03,342
Wow. No-ones offered to
help me for such a long time.

189
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:05,467
You guys are awesome

190
00:14:05,508 --> 00:14:08,842
Really? You think we are awesome?

191
00:14:08,883 --> 00:14:14,175
Yeah, you guys are
caring, and sweet, and...

192
00:14:14,217 --> 00:14:17,050
And not completely hideous to look at?

193
00:14:17,217 --> 00:14:20,425
No, you guys are totally adorable.

194
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:22,342
I think I hit her too hard.

195
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:25,258
But she is beautiful.

196
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:28,883
She can help me break the curse.

197
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:37,133
Who is coming to my birthday party?

198
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:39,092
Has Ariel RSVP'd?

199
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:41,800
She says she can't make it, sir.
She has to wax her legs.

200
00:14:41,842 --> 00:14:43,133
But she's a mermaid!

201
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:44,342
What about Sleeping Beauty?

202
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,592
Doctor's appointment.

203
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:47,758
- Is she sick?
- Says she has insomnia.

204
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,050
If she's not gonna sleep,
she can come to our party.

205
00:14:50,092 --> 00:14:51,092
What about Rapunzel?

206
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:54,258
And don't tell me she's
getting her hair done.

207
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,508
Nope. It's something called, uh, book.

208
00:14:57,592 --> 00:14:58,550
Princess Cruise?

209
00:14:58,592 --> 00:14:59,717
That's a ship, sir.

210
00:14:59,758 --> 00:15:00,425
Princess Leia?

211
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:01,609
She's a general!

212
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:04,383
I demand glorious guests!

213
00:15:04,592 --> 00:15:07,842
How can I be any more unpopular!

214
00:15:07,883 --> 00:15:10,550
And I don't understand, why?

215
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,842
Greetings, Prince Average.

216
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:18,425
It's pronounced Avv-vous-rarge.

217
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,925
Sure it is.

218
00:15:20,217 --> 00:15:23,800
If you're here for the 'We Love
Our Peasants' group giveaway,

219
00:15:23,842 --> 00:15:26,717
that motion is ended.
Grab your wrinkles and go.

220
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:27,883
Move along.

221
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:35,717
Do you think that people would respect you,

222
00:15:35,758 --> 00:15:42,633
if you celebrated your birthday with
a beautiful woman on your arm?

223
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:46,092
Finally, someone talking sense!

224
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:47,967
This horrible crone gets it!

225
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:50,675
May I suggest inviting

226
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,258
this young lady?

227
00:15:54,342 --> 00:15:57,092
She's beautiful, when can she get here?

228
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:58,967
Well, that's up to you.

229
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:02,675
You see, she's stolen something from me.

230
00:16:02,883 --> 00:16:08,758
You find her, bring her along with you,
and you won't look like such a loser,

231
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:12,050
and I get my shoes back.

232
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:14,217
Fear not, loyal hag.

233
00:16:14,258 --> 00:16:16,383
I, Prince Average,

234
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:20,383
shall find this fugitive,
and make her pay for her crimes,

235
00:16:20,508 --> 00:16:22,550
by making her attend my birthday party.

236
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:26,092
There shall be balloons!

237
00:16:26,175 --> 00:16:29,550
I just thought of it.
Let's have a lot of balloons!

238
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:31,758
What a buffoon.

239
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:42,300
It looks just like papa.

240
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,717
Papa won't recognise me.

241
00:16:55,633 --> 00:17:00,050
Why won't... why won't these
shoes just come off?

242
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:09,383
Yes, this is me.

243
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:21,342
Would you like to join me
in a moisturising mask?

244
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:24,467
Oh, thanks, oh. But I am...

245
00:17:25,383 --> 00:17:26,360
Oh!

246
00:17:26,384 --> 00:17:27,425
So tired.

247
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:28,758
Are you sure?

248
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:31,717
It's very important to take
care of your skin.

249
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:32,758
Positive.

250
00:17:34,883 --> 00:17:38,258
But this is the finest French
recipe meant to hydrate skin.

251
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:40,967
It is made of French poopee!

252
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,300
Papa?

253
00:17:44,467 --> 00:17:48,800
Hmm. A spell that makes you fall in love.

254
00:17:49,092 --> 00:17:50,550
Oh, there it is.

255
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:53,175
Merlin! Have you seen my cook book?

256
00:17:53,217 --> 00:17:55,425
Have you checked in the kitchen?

257
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:58,967
Ah, silly me! The kitchen. Of course!

258
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:03,383
Now, where was I?

259
00:18:04,175 --> 00:18:06,425
Merlin, have you seen my moisturizer?

260
00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:09,383
- It's nowhere to be...
- No!

261
00:18:09,425 --> 00:18:12,592
Whatever it is, I haven't seen it.
Now please, go away.

262
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,717
Someone's got anger management issues.

263
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,383
Getting a kiss was never
a problem with this face.

264
00:18:24,217 --> 00:18:25,217
Red Shoes?

265
00:18:27,258 --> 00:18:28,592
Papa?

266
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:31,008
Papa? Are you there?

267
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:32,967
Papa?

268
00:18:55,883 --> 00:19:00,175
Boys! I'm telling you. Sweet treats are
the way to a woman's heart.

269
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,675
It works! I call it, an auto portrait.

270
00:19:05,717 --> 00:19:07,342
I call it, the duplicatertron.

271
00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:08,842
I call it, selfie!

272
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:10,550
Red Shoes must love it!

273
00:19:10,592 --> 00:19:12,050
Monsieur, monsieur.

274
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:14,758
She doesn't want sweets and selfies.

275
00:19:14,925 --> 00:19:17,258
Women want diamonds.

276
00:19:17,508 --> 00:19:18,508
Merlin?

277
00:19:24,758 --> 00:19:28,550
The Book of Spells To
Make You Fall In Love?

278
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:36,342
Okay, big, terrifying, wooden bunny.

279
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,842
You're a nice bunny.

280
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:40,842
You're a Vegan bunny, right?

281
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:46,800
What was that? Lightning?

282
00:19:46,925 --> 00:19:49,425
Actually, it's called magic. I do it.

283
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:51,717
Really? Then do some!

284
00:20:12,425 --> 00:20:15,258
Keep running, and whatever
you do, don't look back.

285
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,592
But I can't leave without you.

286
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:19,092
You're looking back. Don't do that.

287
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,300
But...

288
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,925
Hate to zap you longears,

289
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:25,592
But I need to impress a beautiful woman.

290
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,925
Big, scary bunny! Over here!

291
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:29,967
Red! Stop putting yourself in...

292
00:20:32,175 --> 00:20:33,842
danger...

293
00:20:53,592 --> 00:20:55,300
Arthur! I got you.

294
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:58,008
It's no use, Red Shoes.

295
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,717
I'm slippin' away. Not much time...

296
00:21:01,758 --> 00:21:04,883
Just... need to... use that core of mine...

297
00:21:04,925 --> 00:21:07,425
I see the light at the end of the funnel.

298
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:11,133
Time for me to kick the bucket

299
00:21:11,175 --> 00:21:13,175
I had a good run. I was God blessed.

300
00:21:13,217 --> 00:21:17,217
Oh, I used to be able to bench two fifty!

301
00:21:17,425 --> 00:21:20,592
Before I go, how about a farewell kiss?

302
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:23,675
Red Shoes! Thank goodness you're safe.

303
00:21:23,925 --> 00:21:26,633
Do you need CPR? I'm basically an expert.

304
00:21:26,675 --> 00:21:28,925
And don't worry, I brushed my teeth.

305
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:31,217
No, No, No. I'm fine,
but Arthur, he's stuck.

306
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:32,717
He tried to save me and...

307
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,217
Would you get up?

308
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:36,258
What? He's not hurt?

309
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:38,842
- Only his pride.
- Seriously Arthur?

310
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:41,383
You need to find a better
way to hit on girls.

311
00:21:50,717 --> 00:21:53,592
Stand back! I may have to risk my life.

312
00:22:02,883 --> 00:22:04,758
Someone call for three inventors?

313
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:06,383
For three geniuses?

314
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:08,467
That sounds like us!

315
00:22:09,717 --> 00:22:13,175
Everyone came runnin' to help,
great, just great.

316
00:22:13,217 --> 00:22:14,925
Everyone except Merlin, that is.

317
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:17,175
Ah! Super, there he is now.

318
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,675
Where have you been?

319
00:22:18,717 --> 00:22:21,467
Something awful could've happened
to Red if I hadn't shown up.

320
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:22,592
You?

321
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,550
Don't even go there!

322
00:22:25,925 --> 00:22:28,092
I saved her first.

323
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:31,133
- Right?
- I was worried about you.

324
00:22:31,258 --> 00:22:33,175
I was worried about me too.

325
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:36,342
- But mostly you.
- No-one needs to worry.

326
00:22:36,383 --> 00:22:38,633
Arthur's here. Please, my lady.

327
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:40,050
Um... Okay.

328
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,383
You shouldn't go into the
forest by yourself.

329
00:22:51,592 --> 00:22:56,633
It's a nightmarish landsacpe, fit only for
bloodthirsty warriors like myself.

330
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,175
And squirrels.

331
00:22:58,342 --> 00:23:00,050
I thought I saw my father.

332
00:23:00,717 --> 00:23:03,467
Turned out, just to be that big bunny.

333
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:07,633
Well, if you ever make such a dangerous
and weird mistake again,

334
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,967
just know that I can protect you.

335
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:11,758
This's very kind.

336
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,425
And if you really want to express
your gratitude, you can...

337
00:23:18,217 --> 00:23:20,675
Oh, I am so sorry.

338
00:23:20,717 --> 00:23:26,008
This was much slappier than
I intended it to be.

339
00:23:26,383 --> 00:23:28,800
Oh! It happens. No problem.

340
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,758
Maybe an apology kiss then?

341
00:23:34,383 --> 00:23:35,800
Bravo mon ami!

342
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,675
Nice try.

343
00:23:38,342 --> 00:23:39,883
Red Shoes.

344
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:48,092
Gentlemen, to break this curse, we're going
to have to work as a tightly knit team.

345
00:23:48,217 --> 00:23:50,133
Which means, you do everything I say.

346
00:23:50,217 --> 00:23:51,758
- Excuse?
- Huh? - What? - No.

347
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,550
You got to be kidding.

348
00:23:52,592 --> 00:23:54,842
Hans and Jack will search
around the Dismal Lake.

349
00:23:54,925 --> 00:23:57,800
Triplets! You search the Caves Of Despair.

350
00:23:57,925 --> 00:24:00,967
Red Shoe and I, will go
to Golden Goose Avenue.

351
00:24:01,092 --> 00:24:05,758
Golden Goose Avenue, which happens
to be your go to place for dates.

352
00:24:05,883 --> 00:24:08,092
We are going to focus on the mission.

353
00:24:08,258 --> 00:24:10,550
And then see where the evening takes us.

354
00:24:10,842 --> 00:24:15,008
The only thing you're going to shop for
on Golden Goose Avenue, is rejection.

355
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,717
And you can't even afford that.

356
00:24:16,883 --> 00:24:19,467
I like my odds. You saw what she did.

357
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:21,842
An expression of affection.

358
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:23,842
Every woman shows it differently.

359
00:24:23,967 --> 00:24:25,467
You took your shot. You got slapped.

360
00:24:25,508 --> 00:24:26,550
May I remind you

361
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:30,467
that this is the closest thing to a
kiss anyone's had since the curse.

362
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:35,133
Let's work together to guide
Red Shoes' feelings towards me

363
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:37,008
so we can break the curse.

364
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,342
What about the rest of us?

365
00:24:38,383 --> 00:24:40,883
After I resume my princely form,

366
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,508
the word about F-Seven will be out.

367
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:47,300
Ladies will be begging
to kiss your green mugs.

368
00:24:47,383 --> 00:24:49,175
- Really?
- Sounds reasonable.

369
00:24:49,258 --> 00:24:50,758
I'll bring the gelato!

370
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,383
Getting one kiss sure is easier
than getting seven.

371
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:56,342
This is not a plan,
he's just out for himself!

372
00:24:56,383 --> 00:24:58,383
A half baked plan is better than none.

373
00:24:58,425 --> 00:25:02,008
Don't worry Merlin,
I have a big assignment for you.

374
00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:04,258
Big assignment?

375
00:25:04,592 --> 00:25:06,758
Here you go. I drew these up last night.

376
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:10,508
I can't tell if this
drawing is terrible, or

377
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:12,842
really avant garde.

378
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:15,175
Oh, my neighbor's a great art teacher.

379
00:25:15,342 --> 00:25:16,717
Pablo Picassover?

380
00:25:16,758 --> 00:25:20,550
One thing's for sure,
daddy's on the big side...

381
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:22,717
of big.

382
00:25:23,883 --> 00:25:25,300
You must take after your mother.

383
00:25:25,508 --> 00:25:26,828
No, I look a lot like papa... Oh!

384
00:25:27,758 --> 00:25:34,008
Yeah, my mother. Gosh!
We... exactly! Twins!

385
00:25:34,842 --> 00:25:37,675
Alright. You know the plan. Let's move.

386
00:25:37,717 --> 00:25:40,508
Deploy! Thunderdwarfs are go!

387
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:44,467
And where d'ya think you're going?

388
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,508
Your post is right there.

389
00:25:46,592 --> 00:25:49,175
You'll watch the savage monster.
I call him Vicious!

390
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:50,758
I call him Woodbottom.

391
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:53,258
Do not worry Merlin. We'll make
sure you get kissed too.

392
00:25:53,508 --> 00:25:54,717
Eventually.

393
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,508
We'll split up here.

394
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,300
Alright, see you later.

395
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:03,133
I know exactly where we should
look to find your father.

396
00:26:03,383 --> 00:26:04,883
Really? Where?

397
00:26:12,925 --> 00:26:14,050
Daddy!

398
00:26:14,342 --> 00:26:15,342
Wow!

399
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:17,508
Is this what I think it is?

400
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:23,592
I present Excalibur, the legendary
sword trapped in this rock for centuries.

401
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:27,342
Waiting for a man of great
strength to release it.

402
00:26:27,383 --> 00:26:30,633
It says 'Do not attempt
to remove by force'.

403
00:26:30,717 --> 00:26:33,217
Oh, right. I guess. Ahem.

404
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:39,633
The truth is, I realized you were the woman
of my destiny the first time I saw you.

405
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:42,675
I thought if I could show you my strength

406
00:26:42,925 --> 00:26:45,133
I would be worthy of your affections.

407
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,050
Oh!

408
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,508
Oops, I'll put it back.

409
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,217
No No No! Can I have it?

410
00:27:04,592 --> 00:27:07,758
Oh, Arthur, it's just beginner's luck.

411
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:10,342
You want me to, maybe pull
it out for you again?

412
00:27:10,592 --> 00:27:12,842
No, I'm not humiliated at all.

413
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:14,675
Let's go.

414
00:27:24,258 --> 00:27:28,008
Don't look at me like that,
I'm the real prisoner here.

415
00:27:28,258 --> 00:27:30,342
What? You hungry?

416
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,383
And fetch!

417
00:27:41,342 --> 00:27:43,092
Hop along, big guy!

418
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,050
There's no way Arthur is
breaking this curse alone!

419
00:28:03,008 --> 00:28:04,092
Woah!

420
00:28:05,842 --> 00:28:07,633
Arthur, where're you going?

421
00:28:10,883 --> 00:28:11,883
Okay.

422
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:13,592
See you later.

423
00:28:14,758 --> 00:28:15,758
Hi.

424
00:28:16,675 --> 00:28:18,592
Oh, look at what you made me do!

425
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:19,717
You...

426
00:28:19,925 --> 00:28:21,133
I'm sorry.

427
00:28:21,342 --> 00:28:23,342
Made me make it perfect.

428
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Thank you.

429
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,300
Woah!

430
00:28:27,383 --> 00:28:29,175
I'm so sorry.

431
00:28:29,217 --> 00:28:32,133
No, don't be. I am sorry.

432
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:33,800
Are you alright?

433
00:28:33,925 --> 00:28:34,902
And...

434
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:36,717
don't worry about this.

435
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:40,633
What?

436
00:28:40,842 --> 00:28:42,217
Ta-da!

437
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:46,925
Excuse me, have you seen this man?

438
00:29:49,425 --> 00:29:52,217
Arthur, I was thinking.

439
00:29:52,258 --> 00:29:54,967
What if I just pull out
the Excalibur for you?

440
00:29:55,008 --> 00:29:56,508
Our secret.

441
00:29:57,258 --> 00:29:59,425
Really? We have a secret now?

442
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:00,050
Yeah.

443
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:02,693
I like a girl who can
keep things classified.

444
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,008
Let's find your pops, friend.

445
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:06,217
'Bye guys.

446
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,300
What?

447
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:14,633
Hey, you.

448
00:30:15,008 --> 00:30:16,133
No.

449
00:30:17,342 --> 00:30:18,342
Hey!

450
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:19,967
Stop!

451
00:30:25,883 --> 00:30:26,883
Come on!

452
00:30:54,217 --> 00:30:56,425
Oh, you guys don't have to help.

453
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,633
That's not her. Come on.

454
00:30:58,675 --> 00:30:59,675
Sorry miss.

455
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:06,133
Red Shoes! Where has she gone?

456
00:31:06,175 --> 00:31:07,925
Where's Red Shoes?

457
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:09,633
That's what I'd like to know.

458
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:11,425
Wait a minute.

459
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,092
Who said you could leave your post?

460
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:15,175
I'm just walking the bunny.

461
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:20,008
Red Shoes, where are you?

462
00:31:20,175 --> 00:31:22,383
Hey, have you seen this girl?

463
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,258
Look what I found

464
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,592
Oh, those're mine.
Can I, actually have my shoes back?

465
00:31:35,425 --> 00:31:37,717
No way. You're not serious, are you?

466
00:31:37,758 --> 00:31:41,508
I'm really not in the mood,
Can you just, please give them back to me?

467
00:31:42,342 --> 00:31:44,008
Ha! They won't even fit on you.

468
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,133
They're gonna fit me better
than they fit you.

469
00:31:46,175 --> 00:31:47,175
Hey!

470
00:31:48,175 --> 00:31:49,258
Red Shoes!

471
00:31:49,383 --> 00:31:51,175
Guys! Guys, I'm here.

472
00:31:54,758 --> 00:31:57,842
- Red Shoes!
- Red Shoes! Where are you?

473
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:01,758
Even the hideous dwarfs won't help you.

474
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,050
Those dwarfs are not hideous.

475
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,800
And I don't need anyone to help me.

476
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,675
Freeze! Put the shoes down.

477
00:32:13,717 --> 00:32:16,258
Get on your knees and put
your hands behind your head.

478
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,092
On second thought, they're yours.

479
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:21,258
There's no need to push me in a corner

480
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:23,342
Super scary.

481
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:35,758
Your red shoes, milady.

482
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,550
Thank you.

483
00:32:37,758 --> 00:32:40,425
Excuse me, miss, have we met?

484
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,258
Well, that's kind of a
complicated question.

485
00:32:44,383 --> 00:32:45,758
Red Shoes!

486
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:48,925
Gotta go. Be safe.

487
00:33:09,133 --> 00:33:10,133
Guys!

488
00:33:12,675 --> 00:33:14,258
Where has she gone?

489
00:33:15,425 --> 00:33:16,675
Red Shoes!

490
00:33:17,092 --> 00:33:18,092
Stop!

491
00:33:20,967 --> 00:33:21,967
Hold on!

492
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,550
Wait a minute.

493
00:33:27,717 --> 00:33:29,883
Gotcha now, don't we?

494
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,800
I don't get it.

495
00:33:35,383 --> 00:33:37,925
Now we know how fast a
bunny can hop in a pinch.

496
00:33:38,175 --> 00:33:39,717
Thank you for helping me, Merlin.

497
00:33:39,883 --> 00:33:41,300
A pleasure, milady.

498
00:33:41,717 --> 00:33:43,800
But I also did it for us.

499
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:47,217
By the way, what is this?

500
00:33:48,342 --> 00:33:50,300
Gosh, it seems silly but...

501
00:33:50,967 --> 00:33:52,425
It's my shoes

502
00:33:53,383 --> 00:33:55,842
- They're magical.
- I know, they're fabulous.

503
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,425
But why're they after you?

504
00:33:57,467 --> 00:34:01,758
No, my shoes, they're
actually made of magic.

505
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,133
Red Shoes!

506
00:34:03,425 --> 00:34:04,467
Are you a criminal?

507
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,592
No, of course not.

508
00:34:07,217 --> 00:34:10,425
I knew a girl this pretty couldn't
possibly be a criminal.

509
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:13,967
Look, we should head out now, there
could be more guards around any minute.

510
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:17,092
Don't worry about them,
I've got these bad boys.

511
00:34:17,467 --> 00:34:20,383
This is gonna make it so much
harder to find my dad.

512
00:34:24,342 --> 00:34:25,383
I have an idea!

513
00:35:01,092 --> 00:35:02,300
Ta-da!

514
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,175
Oh wow!

515
00:35:09,717 --> 00:35:10,717
What do you think?

516
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,883
That is amazing.

517
00:35:15,425 --> 00:35:16,217
Thank you.

518
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:36,217
You had a thing on your cheek.

519
00:35:36,258 --> 00:35:37,342
Alright, let's go.

520
00:35:57,133 --> 00:36:00,550
- We've been walking for hours.
- And we'll keep walking 'till we find them.

521
00:36:07,342 --> 00:36:09,092
Now we got her.

522
00:36:10,592 --> 00:36:12,967
- Are they gone?
- Shh. Who cares? -

523
00:36:13,175 --> 00:36:14,675
C'mon. Let's go see.

524
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:16,717
Look at that.

525
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,694
- Wow!
- Wow!

526
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,758
Awsome!

527
00:36:19,883 --> 00:36:20,800
Who's that?

528
00:36:20,842 --> 00:36:22,217
It's the girl's father.

529
00:36:22,383 --> 00:36:23,675
But where's the girl?

530
00:36:23,842 --> 00:36:26,842
It says to go to Risky Rock,
so she must be there.

531
00:36:27,342 --> 00:36:28,717
Why Risky Rock?

532
00:36:28,842 --> 00:36:30,050
We should ask the girl.

533
00:36:30,092 --> 00:36:32,467
Perfect! Where's the girl?

534
00:36:32,717 --> 00:36:36,050
It says to go to Risky Rock,
so she must be there.

535
00:36:36,342 --> 00:36:38,633
But, why Risky Rock?

536
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,026
We should ask the girl.

537
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,027
Umm...

538
00:36:41,051 --> 00:36:42,217
Where's the girl?

539
00:36:42,258 --> 00:36:44,842
It says to go to Risky Rock,
so she must be there.

540
00:36:44,883 --> 00:36:47,133
But, why Risky Rock?

541
00:36:47,342 --> 00:36:48,550
We should ask the girl.

542
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,550
Oww!

543
00:37:09,967 --> 00:37:11,092
What was that for?

544
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:14,133
You, sir, are sabotaging my
relationship with Red Shoes.

545
00:37:14,175 --> 00:37:16,425
What relationship are
you talking about?

546
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:19,008
Red Shoes and I share a secret.

547
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:22,008
I would tell you what it is,
but it's a secret.

548
00:37:22,133 --> 00:37:25,550
While you're busy keeping secrets,
I'm going to break my curse.

549
00:37:25,633 --> 00:37:27,842
You're nothing without
your spells, magic boy.

550
00:37:27,883 --> 00:37:30,383
And you're nothing without Excalibur.

551
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:34,967
You're not waiting for someone to
pull it out for you, are you?

552
00:37:35,008 --> 00:37:36,050
How did you know?

553
00:37:36,175 --> 00:37:37,258
Is it true?

554
00:37:52,342 --> 00:37:53,925
Hans, you shouldn't have.

555
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,883
Something sweet, for someone sweeter.

556
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:00,467
This is spectacular!

557
00:38:00,508 --> 00:38:03,193
Oh, it's nothing.
Just let me know what you want.

558
00:38:03,217 --> 00:38:06,550
Any time, for the rest of your life.
Do you like fondue?

559
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:11,800
Behold! Carved by the finest jewellers
out of all the jewellers I know

560
00:38:12,092 --> 00:38:13,342
which is a lot.

561
00:38:14,717 --> 00:38:15,175
Pretty.

562
00:38:15,217 --> 00:38:19,800
And it's yours, Miss Shoes,
yours in exchange for nothing.

563
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:20,800
Make it a kiss.

564
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:23,925
That's really sweet Jack,
but I can't accept it.

565
00:38:24,175 --> 00:38:26,967
I don't want your jewells,
only your good intentions.

566
00:38:27,008 --> 00:38:30,425
My intentions are more than good,
they're super bonne.

567
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:31,592
Testing one, two.

568
00:38:31,675 --> 00:38:34,425
Testing one... no,
I'm pushing it, you dolt.

569
00:38:34,467 --> 00:38:36,633
Attention! Hideous trolls!

570
00:38:36,675 --> 00:38:39,842
Is it dwarfs with an 'f',
or dwarves, with a 'v'?

571
00:38:39,883 --> 00:38:41,443
I want to use whatever's more offensive.

572
00:38:41,467 --> 00:38:43,508
Oh, it's that loser, Prince Average.

573
00:38:43,592 --> 00:38:45,758
I heard that! It's Avv-vous-rarge!

574
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,717
Oh, please.

575
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:52,133
Inside your amateurs attempt at a facade of
a sham of a travesty of a veneer of a castle

576
00:38:52,175 --> 00:38:55,300
is a gorgeous wanted criminal.

577
00:38:55,383 --> 00:38:59,925
I hereby command that all of you exit
the premises and surrender post haste.

578
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:04,008
Fail to comply, and you will
never see these two again.

579
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,883
You have until three.

580
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:07,175
One.

581
00:39:09,383 --> 00:39:10,175
Two.

582
00:39:10,342 --> 00:39:11,717
I lied. Charge!

583
00:39:32,342 --> 00:39:33,717
Am I the person you want?

584
00:39:33,758 --> 00:39:35,592
Yes, yes you are.

585
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,342
Though I don't know if you're a person
or a vision of beauty, some kind of angelic

586
00:39:39,675 --> 00:39:43,342
thing with wings. Angelic wing things?

587
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:47,175
I will come with you,
but only after you release my friends.

588
00:39:47,383 --> 00:39:48,383
Do it. Do it!

589
00:39:50,425 --> 00:39:53,133
Now, here's the good news.
It's my birthday!

590
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,758
And you are going to be
the belle of the ball.

591
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,550
The invitation sounds great,
really. But...

592
00:40:00,633 --> 00:40:02,883
It wasn't an invitation,
more of an order.

593
00:40:03,008 --> 00:40:03,967
Prepare the lady's carriage.

594
00:40:04,008 --> 00:40:06,550
She said she doesn't want to go, Average.

595
00:40:06,592 --> 00:40:09,508
Avv-vous-rarge!

596
00:40:09,633 --> 00:40:11,258
Don't troll me, Troll.

597
00:40:11,633 --> 00:40:12,758
Ah! So rude.

598
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,050
I couldn't agree more.
Subjects these days.

599
00:40:15,092 --> 00:40:16,217
Now. Shall we?

600
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,800
Get her!

601
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,734
You hold off the guards, and
I'll get her out of here.

602
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,800
No, I'm faster. You stay
here and buy us time.

603
00:40:39,133 --> 00:40:39,925
Here's a thought.

604
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:42,300
Stop fighting and fight!

605
00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:44,883
What's the plan?

606
00:40:45,925 --> 00:40:47,383
Rescue Red Shoes.

607
00:40:47,425 --> 00:40:49,342
Like the old days, guys.

608
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,300
Arthur!

609
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,467
Can we get this over with?
They're just dwarfs!

610
00:41:45,758 --> 00:41:48,217
Did you guys hear something?

611
00:41:57,258 --> 00:41:58,258
Come on!

612
00:42:18,633 --> 00:42:19,633
Duck!

613
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,092
Hi, guards, are we taking a break?

614
00:42:28,175 --> 00:42:29,300
Well, FYI

615
00:42:29,342 --> 00:42:31,592
They're getting away!

616
00:42:38,467 --> 00:42:39,592
No!

617
00:42:45,592 --> 00:42:47,925
Who's throwin' vegetables?

618
00:42:52,467 --> 00:42:55,342
Yeah! You just got Merlined!

619
00:43:03,508 --> 00:43:04,508
Run!

620
00:43:05,925 --> 00:43:06,925
Jack!

621
00:43:17,633 --> 00:43:18,633
Duck!

622
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:25,300
I'm so sorry. You alright?

623
00:43:25,425 --> 00:43:27,675
No. I'm not.

624
00:43:33,383 --> 00:43:36,383
Gentlemen, he surrenders.

625
00:43:36,592 --> 00:43:37,592
What?

626
00:44:07,592 --> 00:44:09,008
Engines. Full power.

627
00:44:09,092 --> 00:44:10,092
Shields up.

628
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,592
Turn on the mini frizzer.

629
00:44:31,342 --> 00:44:32,842
Superhero landing!

630
00:44:33,008 --> 00:44:33,967
Hooray for us!

631
00:44:34,008 --> 00:44:36,383
- We did it!
- It was mostly me.

632
00:44:36,425 --> 00:44:37,425
Yeah!

633
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:38,925
What?

634
00:44:42,383 --> 00:44:43,633
You've got to be kidding.

635
00:44:43,717 --> 00:44:46,217
Finally the big guns, thank you.

636
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:47,467
Fire!

637
00:44:55,758 --> 00:44:56,758
Fire!

638
00:45:02,675 --> 00:45:04,217
Ooh, close.

639
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:06,342
The cannonball. Not you.

640
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:09,383
Timeout, timeout.
Everyone, timeout.

641
00:45:09,758 --> 00:45:13,050
You almost blew her up, and she can't
come to my party if you blow her up.

642
00:45:13,092 --> 00:45:14,217
Sorry, sir.

643
00:45:14,592 --> 00:45:16,050
Alright. Time back in.

644
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,258
Surrender monsters!

645
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,467
No! Wait!

646
00:45:51,967 --> 00:45:53,300
Oh. That's pretty cool.

647
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,092
Everyone inside. And hurry!

648
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:19,467
You messed with the wrong prince.

649
00:46:19,633 --> 00:46:22,300
There is nothing average
about Avv-vous-rarge.

650
00:46:22,508 --> 00:46:25,758
I shall return!

651
00:46:25,967 --> 00:46:26,883
On Tuesday.

652
00:46:26,925 --> 00:46:29,258
No, wait. I'll check my calendar...

653
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:33,383
Thursday, I shall return Thursday!

654
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:36,008
We'll be ready.

655
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:36,842
And waiting.

656
00:46:36,925 --> 00:46:37,883
Arrivederci!

657
00:46:37,925 --> 00:46:38,925
Ciao for now!

658
00:46:39,008 --> 00:46:39,758
Bye bye!

659
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:41,508
You just got dwarfed!

660
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:43,675
Is that better? I think Merlined is better.

661
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:04,425
You should have seen the look on his big
ugly face when bunny came running at him.

662
00:47:05,467 --> 00:47:07,633
That's how you see everything, isn't it?

663
00:47:07,675 --> 00:47:08,967
With my eyes?

664
00:47:09,175 --> 00:47:12,050
You always talk about
what someone looks like.

665
00:47:12,133 --> 00:47:14,633
I do? I wouldn't say that.

666
00:47:14,675 --> 00:47:17,258
But I can't wait for you
to see the real me.

667
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:19,425
What kind of Merlin is the real you?

668
00:47:19,633 --> 00:47:21,050
You might not believe it,

669
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:24,675
but the real me is famous,
handsome, and even popular.

670
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,800
Not short, stumpy and green.

671
00:47:27,925 --> 00:47:31,217
Yeah, you're short, stumpy and green, but

672
00:47:31,258 --> 00:47:34,175
you're also a wonderful
and charming person.

673
00:47:34,217 --> 00:47:35,717
I'm not explaining it right.

674
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,383
If you saw the real me,
you'd know exactly what I mean.

675
00:47:40,217 --> 00:47:42,175
I think I can see the real you.

676
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,008
And I like you, just as you are.

677
00:47:47,883 --> 00:47:49,175
That's hilarious.

678
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:53,300
Here, close your eyes,
and imagine the real me.

679
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,300
I guarantee you, it'll be different.

680
00:47:57,967 --> 00:48:01,592
I do feel something different ..

681
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,800
Really?

682
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:05,217
But eyes opened or closed

683
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,550
to me you're still Merlin.

684
00:48:08,925 --> 00:48:13,467
Now tell me, who am I to you?

685
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:15,592
You're a gift.

686
00:48:15,717 --> 00:48:19,925
A gift that'll transform me
into someone amazing.

687
00:48:20,633 --> 00:48:22,717
Just like you're amazing.

688
00:48:30,967 --> 00:48:34,008
Actually, I want to show you something too.

689
00:48:38,592 --> 00:48:40,008
You need a hand?

690
00:48:40,133 --> 00:48:43,508
Hold on. Nope. Stand back. I got this.

691
00:48:44,133 --> 00:48:45,675
One...

692
00:48:45,717 --> 00:48:47,467
Two, yeah, okay, I need help.

693
00:49:05,758 --> 00:49:07,234
Woah. Woah woah woah.

694
00:49:07,258 --> 00:49:09,050
No thankyou.

695
00:49:15,133 --> 00:49:18,300
You know what the weird thing is?
They're super comfortable.

696
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:23,883
Y'know, I'm just saying. Where were
you when the facade was falling?

697
00:49:23,925 --> 00:49:26,050
I mean, that was terrifying.

698
00:49:27,883 --> 00:49:28,967
What're you doing here?

699
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,883
I have come for my shoes.

700
00:49:33,175 --> 00:49:37,526
Well, I had them. I mean I saw them.
But those dwarfs!

701
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:40,092
It's dwarves with a 'v'.
So you failed?

702
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,800
I did not fail, I took a timeout.

703
00:49:44,883 --> 00:49:46,883
Yeah. This is a calculated timeout.

704
00:49:46,925 --> 00:49:49,125
I'm going to return on Thursday,
we all pencilled it in.

705
00:49:49,175 --> 00:49:50,175
Silence!

706
00:49:50,467 --> 00:49:51,967
Have a bite.

707
00:49:52,508 --> 00:49:53,967
For strength.

708
00:49:54,633 --> 00:49:58,800
Apples, the most suspicious of fruits.

709
00:49:58,842 --> 00:50:01,508
I don't have much time, Prince.

710
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,800
You could still have the
best birthday ever,

711
00:50:05,967 --> 00:50:07,425
But remember...

712
00:50:07,467 --> 00:50:14,092
What's bad for me,
will be very bad for you.

713
00:50:20,175 --> 00:50:21,175
She's gone.

714
00:50:22,383 --> 00:50:24,675
Ah! What's the worst that could happen.

715
00:50:28,717 --> 00:50:29,717
It's kind of sweet.

716
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:46,967
Don't move.

717
00:50:47,092 --> 00:50:47,633
Okay.

718
00:50:47,675 --> 00:50:49,758
Pino, Noki Kio, show us what you got.

719
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,717
Okey doky!

720
00:50:50,758 --> 00:50:51,550
Here we go!

721
00:50:51,592 --> 00:50:52,717
Our pleasure.

722
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,443
Here we go, yeah, a little

723
00:51:02,467 --> 00:51:03,633
Oooh a little over here!

724
00:51:20,342 --> 00:51:22,133
Now that looks like a real home.

725
00:51:22,175 --> 00:51:24,133
Yep. I could get used to that.

726
00:51:24,342 --> 00:51:25,550
Uh uh. I cannot.

727
00:51:29,217 --> 00:51:32,217
It's a perfect copy of my drawing.
That's incredible.

728
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:34,800
Let me try.

729
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,300
This will definitely make it easier to
find your dad.

730
00:51:38,383 --> 00:51:40,675
Unfortunately, this thing aint flying.

731
00:51:40,717 --> 00:51:41,550
It's grounded.

732
00:51:41,592 --> 00:51:42,592
Why does it need to fly?

733
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:45,383
The posters are no good if we
can't distribute them fast.

734
00:51:45,633 --> 00:51:49,550
Guys, thankyou so much for
everything you're doing.

735
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:52,050
- My pleasure.
- It's nice.

736
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:02,592
Opening doors!

737
00:53:18,633 --> 00:53:21,842
You know Merlin, I feel so
lucky that I've met you.

738
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:24,425
I feel the same way.

739
00:53:24,842 --> 00:53:28,175
I feel like anything is possible.

740
00:53:44,425 --> 00:53:46,550
Merlin! Watch out!

741
00:53:57,550 --> 00:53:58,967
Merlin.

742
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,842
Merlin.

743
00:54:03,133 --> 00:54:04,133
Merlin!

744
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:06,050
Everything okay?

745
00:54:06,467 --> 00:54:07,675
Of course! Sure!

746
00:54:08,467 --> 00:54:09,734
Nothing to be embarrassed about.

747
00:54:09,758 --> 00:54:13,967
So why are we even talking about
that when we should be going...

748
00:54:14,008 --> 00:54:15,008
this direction.

749
00:54:15,175 --> 00:54:16,175
Hey wait!

750
00:54:19,883 --> 00:54:22,800
So, about these magic shoes.

751
00:54:22,967 --> 00:54:24,193
Why, are they still bothering you?

752
00:54:24,217 --> 00:54:26,217
What kind of magic do
those shoes have?

753
00:54:26,592 --> 00:54:29,592
Well .. How do I put this.

754
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,550
Merlin, I used to be strong, really strong.

755
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:36,175
And, I was always proud of that.

756
00:54:36,217 --> 00:54:41,258
But, the shoes magic, umm,
it made me a little dainty?

757
00:54:41,383 --> 00:54:42,425
Sorry to hear.

758
00:54:42,467 --> 00:54:46,758
The shoes made me lose
a little bit of weight.

759
00:54:46,967 --> 00:54:48,175
It could be worse.

760
00:54:48,217 --> 00:54:49,550
Okay.

761
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:52,133
- A lot of weight.
- Ah.

762
00:54:53,217 --> 00:54:57,342
Well, I know what it's like to look different
on the outside from what you feel on the inside.

763
00:55:02,008 --> 00:55:06,050
Merlin, I'd like to give you a
token of my appreciation.

764
00:55:07,467 --> 00:55:09,467
Oh, here, hand me one of your spells.

765
00:55:09,675 --> 00:55:10,175
Why?

766
00:55:10,217 --> 00:55:12,842
Oh, come on. I'm not going to zap you.

767
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,050
Give me a second.

768
00:55:27,467 --> 00:55:31,342
There. Consider it your good luck charm.

769
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,883
Thank you.

770
00:55:42,425 --> 00:55:46,217
Merlin, do you think we'd be happier

771
00:55:46,508 --> 00:55:48,717
if we were our old selves again?

772
00:55:48,883 --> 00:55:51,633
Yep. Yep, yep. Definately we would.

773
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,050
I don't know.

774
00:55:54,175 --> 00:55:55,758
I like how we are.

775
00:55:56,508 --> 00:55:59,883
Right here, just, right now.

776
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:04,258
Even if I'm an ugly green monster?

777
00:56:05,758 --> 00:56:09,342
I don't care about your height
or what colour you are.

778
00:56:10,258 --> 00:56:13,800
And that's the way you
feel about me, right?

779
00:56:13,925 --> 00:56:17,050
Yes, of course. I mean, duhh!

780
00:56:18,717 --> 00:56:22,508
I think we're both just trapped
under the same spell.

781
00:56:38,758 --> 00:56:44,883
Wait. Keep your eyes closed
and don't open them until I say.

782
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:47,133
When you open your eyes there will be...

783
00:56:47,342 --> 00:56:50,008
a handsome man in front of you.

784
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:51,508
Someone worthy of you.

785
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:53,758
Someone you'd be proud to be seen with.

786
00:56:54,967 --> 00:56:56,133
I think you're right.

787
00:56:56,217 --> 00:56:58,758
Ready? And...

788
00:56:59,092 --> 00:57:02,258
Oh, it's such a good day to break a curse!

789
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:05,758
Now!

790
00:57:06,217 --> 00:57:07,383
Ta-da!

791
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:10,550
You just got Merlined!

792
00:57:10,758 --> 00:57:11,925
What do you think?

793
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:15,592
Mission impossibly handsome, right?

794
00:57:17,342 --> 00:57:20,717
Oh, it's okay,
I know this is a lot to take in.

795
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:23,592
But you can let your happiness flag fly.

796
00:57:23,633 --> 00:57:27,550
This, this is the real me.

797
00:57:28,467 --> 00:57:30,550
- It's stupid.
- What?

798
00:57:31,717 --> 00:57:32,925
Wait a minute!

799
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:35,925
My hands are still green sausages.

800
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:39,217
No! I look the same.

801
00:57:39,467 --> 00:57:42,008
Yes, impossibly handsome.

802
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:44,217
This doesn't make sense.

803
00:57:44,342 --> 00:57:47,342
You're the most beautiful woman in
the world, why do I look the same?

804
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:49,467
What're you talking about, Merlin?

805
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:50,925
Do I need a longer kiss?

806
00:57:51,383 --> 00:57:52,383
Two kisses?

807
00:57:53,258 --> 00:57:54,842
Let's try again.

808
00:57:55,383 --> 00:57:56,360
Umm.

809
00:57:56,384 --> 00:57:57,800
You're not making any sense.

810
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,050
Hurry!

811
00:58:10,008 --> 00:58:11,008
What is that?

812
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,883
This kingdom has a serious
monster problem.

813
00:58:29,758 --> 00:58:30,300
Are you alright?

814
00:58:30,342 --> 00:58:32,258
No. I'm not.

815
00:58:40,758 --> 00:58:41,383
Thank you.

816
00:58:41,425 --> 00:58:42,675
Pleasure, milady.

817
00:58:45,008 --> 00:58:46,008
Watch out!

818
00:59:03,633 --> 00:59:05,675
Ha-hah! Yes!

819
00:59:11,758 --> 00:59:14,217
What do they want,
besides smashing us?

820
00:59:14,258 --> 00:59:15,258
I don't know!

821
00:59:24,258 --> 00:59:25,800
The old me would've nailed that.

822
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,675
You just got Merlined!

823
00:59:46,633 --> 00:59:47,633
Hurry!

824
01:00:03,008 --> 01:00:04,467
Red, close your eyes.

825
01:00:04,508 --> 01:00:06,342
This is no time for kissing, Merlin.

826
01:00:06,383 --> 01:00:08,508
Trust me. Close your eyes.

827
01:00:09,717 --> 01:00:11,383
Please, close them!

828
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:17,467
That was too close.

829
01:00:18,258 --> 01:00:19,675
Don't look at me.

830
01:00:19,842 --> 01:00:21,842
You see that tree on the
other side of the bridge?

831
01:00:21,883 --> 01:00:22,467
Yeah.

832
01:00:22,508 --> 01:00:25,508
On my signal, run towards
it as fast as you can.

833
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:27,050
No, I can't leave you here.

834
01:00:27,217 --> 01:00:30,425
You have to.
And don't look back, okay?

835
01:00:30,592 --> 01:00:32,967
Look right at that
tree until I say it's safe.

836
01:00:33,092 --> 01:00:34,675
Promise you won't look.

837
01:00:34,717 --> 01:00:37,175
Okay. I promise.

838
01:00:37,758 --> 01:00:38,758
Now!

839
01:01:10,217 --> 01:01:11,217
What?

840
01:01:11,258 --> 01:01:13,550
You just got Merlined?
Oh. Yes you did.

841
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:44,258
Hey! Locate!

842
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,050
Hey, locate here!

843
01:01:47,342 --> 01:01:50,383
You're even more of a blockhead
than Prince Average.

844
01:01:52,592 --> 01:01:55,050
Avv-vous-rarge!

845
01:01:55,342 --> 01:01:56,800
Prince Average?

846
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:14,633
You just got Merlined.

847
01:02:18,217 --> 01:02:19,550
Take a look, Red Shoes.

848
01:02:19,883 --> 01:02:20,425
Merlin!

849
01:02:20,467 --> 01:02:22,925
I have triumphantly saved the day.

850
01:02:24,092 --> 01:02:25,092
Merlin, no!

851
01:02:27,508 --> 01:02:28,800
Merlin!

852
01:02:33,633 --> 01:02:34,925
Merlin!

853
01:03:39,675 --> 01:03:41,175
Snow White?

854
01:03:50,675 --> 01:03:52,342
Snow White?

855
01:03:52,675 --> 01:03:55,550
The thief was Snow White
this whole time?

856
01:03:55,633 --> 01:03:59,133
Interesting. She could remove the shoes.

857
01:04:00,925 --> 01:04:03,383
You're going after her yourself?

858
01:04:03,467 --> 01:04:05,008
What? Were you going to go?

859
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:08,217
I get it! I don't have legs.

860
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:14,175
So, here I am.

861
01:04:15,258 --> 01:04:16,425
All the real me.

862
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:19,467
I bet you're disappointed, huh?

863
01:04:19,675 --> 01:04:22,717
You're the girl from Golden Goose Avenue.

864
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:23,300
Red Shoes!

865
01:04:23,342 --> 01:04:26,675
That's not my name, it's Snow White.

866
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,300
Princess Snow White? So your father is...

867
01:04:29,342 --> 01:04:31,758
King White, yeah.

868
01:04:32,092 --> 01:04:35,633
By the time I figured out his
new wife Regina was a witch

869
01:04:36,675 --> 01:04:38,508
he'd already disappeared.

870
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:41,550
And the monsters who attacked us

871
01:04:41,592 --> 01:04:45,592
were sent by my stepmother
to get these shoes.

872
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,842
I guess being beautiful is really
worth that much to her.

873
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:53,092
Have you thought about
just giving them back?

874
01:04:54,092 --> 01:04:55,717
And give up their magic?

875
01:04:56,925 --> 01:05:00,508
If I'd given up their magic, you wouldn't
have helped me find my father, would you?

876
01:05:01,467 --> 01:05:02,800
Would you?

877
01:05:06,592 --> 01:05:09,050
I thought we were both
under the same spell.

878
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:13,592
But I see now that I was wrong.

879
01:05:14,008 --> 01:05:19,508
Listen, I can't get into all the details,
but I'm under a curse too.

880
01:05:19,925 --> 01:05:21,842
You still don't get it, Merlin.

881
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:25,550
I'm not talking about our curses.

882
01:05:26,258 --> 01:05:29,050
Merlin, I'm talking about
the kind of spell

883
01:05:30,258 --> 01:05:32,342
you never want to break.

884
01:06:21,008 --> 01:06:23,508
He likes you more than he likes me.

885
01:06:55,383 --> 01:06:58,717
What would've happened if she'd taken
off her shoes that day in the barn?

886
01:06:58,758 --> 01:07:00,175
You think that's important?

887
01:07:02,758 --> 01:07:04,484
I just wonder,

888
01:07:04,508 --> 01:07:07,508
what I would've done if I'd
seen the real Snow White.

889
01:07:07,758 --> 01:07:09,133
Seriously?

890
01:07:09,217 --> 01:07:11,508
It's still all about appearance for you.

891
01:07:11,717 --> 01:07:14,425
No! Not exactly.

892
01:07:15,425 --> 01:07:18,258
But I can't live looking like
you for the rest of my life

893
01:07:18,425 --> 01:07:22,717
Kind of proving my point, other me.
Alright. Let's try this.

894
01:07:23,217 --> 01:07:25,883
Who do you like more,
Snow White or Red Shoes?

895
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:27,967
Easy, it's Red Shoes.

896
01:07:28,133 --> 01:07:30,800
Now, which of us do you
think Red Shoes likes more?

897
01:07:30,883 --> 01:07:32,592
Easy, it's me!

898
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:37,133
Wait. No.

899
01:07:37,717 --> 01:07:38,883
It's...

900
01:07:39,258 --> 01:07:40,300
you.

901
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:17,633
You're a gift.

902
01:08:17,925 --> 01:08:19,609
A gift that'll transform me

903
01:08:19,633 --> 01:08:21,967
into someone amazing.

904
01:08:42,967 --> 01:08:46,925
Well, I know what it's like to look different
on the outside to what we feel on the inside.

905
01:09:06,717 --> 01:09:07,883
Look at that!

906
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:15,592
The shoes. You're wearing them.

907
01:09:15,633 --> 01:09:17,342
I thought you left.

908
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:19,092
You should take them off again.

909
01:09:24,383 --> 01:09:25,383
I can't.

910
01:09:26,175 --> 01:09:29,133
You just had to make things complicated.

911
01:09:30,175 --> 01:09:31,550
Maybe this will help.

912
01:09:31,758 --> 01:09:34,092
Eat the apple, and they'll slide right off.

913
01:09:34,133 --> 01:09:35,258
Where did you get that?

914
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:37,842
I want to help you, Snow White.

915
01:09:38,092 --> 01:09:39,092
Please.

916
01:09:45,758 --> 01:09:46,758
Red Shoes?

917
01:09:47,342 --> 01:09:48,342
Merlin?

918
01:09:49,258 --> 01:09:50,258
Merlin?

919
01:09:53,092 --> 01:09:55,550
What terrible timing you have.

920
01:09:58,550 --> 01:10:00,550
We're gonna have to do this the hard way.

921
01:10:01,258 --> 01:10:02,258
Regina?

922
01:10:05,675 --> 01:10:08,633
Such a tender family reunion.

923
01:10:08,967 --> 01:10:11,092
So sad we can't stay!

924
01:10:11,925 --> 01:10:13,008
Red Shoes!

925
01:10:15,467 --> 01:10:17,383
Come on, let's go, longears.

926
01:10:17,425 --> 01:10:18,967
Hey! Wait for us!

927
01:10:19,008 --> 01:10:21,050
How 'bout you go back
and get the others?

928
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,175
And make lots of copies of this.

929
01:10:23,758 --> 01:10:24,758
Let's go!

930
01:10:27,258 --> 01:10:28,592
We can do this.

931
01:10:28,633 --> 01:10:29,633
Yeah!

932
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:34,508
Your power my lady. It has drained you.

933
01:10:34,592 --> 01:10:38,467
You think? I don't need
you to tell me how I look.

934
01:10:38,633 --> 01:10:40,842
I'm a mirror. It's what I do.

935
01:10:40,883 --> 01:10:43,758
I can't spell.

936
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:44,800
Enough.

937
01:10:45,967 --> 01:10:47,217
Bind her.

938
01:10:48,258 --> 01:10:50,383
It's snack time.

939
01:10:54,008 --> 01:10:56,217
How can you sleep at
a time like this?

940
01:10:57,883 --> 01:11:00,550
I'm not supposed to talk
when I have this on,

941
01:11:00,592 --> 01:11:04,008
but I got to ask.
Do you think they've kissed yet?

942
01:11:04,092 --> 01:11:05,092
I hope so,

943
01:11:05,175 --> 01:11:08,133
because it'll feel better to
punch Merlin when he's pretty.

944
01:11:09,342 --> 01:11:12,508
We've been waiting for a...
Where have you been?

945
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:13,568
Did you break the curse yet?

946
01:11:13,592 --> 01:11:15,258
Merlin, are you hungry?

947
01:11:15,467 --> 01:11:16,592
Those are bears.

948
01:11:16,633 --> 01:11:17,610
Ah...

949
01:11:17,634 --> 01:11:20,508
Hi? This is from Merlin.

950
01:11:38,883 --> 01:11:40,842
Wow! This is so cool.

951
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,092
Okay, sword.

952
01:11:46,258 --> 01:11:51,050
If you think you've humiliated,
embarrassed, and otherwise frustrated me,

953
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:52,717
you're right.

954
01:11:53,217 --> 01:11:56,883
But that ends now!

955
01:12:06,467 --> 01:12:08,508
Oh, zut alors. Please end this.

956
01:12:20,133 --> 01:12:24,217
Hey! Wait! You're running the wrong way.

957
01:12:24,258 --> 01:12:25,592
The castle's over there.

958
01:12:42,508 --> 01:12:43,508
Sit.

959
01:12:55,133 --> 01:12:58,967
Eat this darling, and you'll
get your freedom.

960
01:12:59,133 --> 01:13:00,467
Where is my father?

961
01:13:01,133 --> 01:13:05,133
Royal loyal little girl,
pining for her papa?

962
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:09,842
This is getting a little boring, so I need
you to take a bite, and I'll tell you.

963
01:13:09,967 --> 01:13:11,383
I won't let you win.

964
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:15,258
You've torn apart my family,
and you will not get away with it, Regina.

965
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:19,133
Ooh, I'm so scared, Snow.

966
01:13:19,425 --> 01:13:22,383
Very well. A different approach.

967
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:32,050
- Merlin!
- No!

968
01:13:32,508 --> 01:13:35,050
Eat the apple, or watch him die.

969
01:13:35,217 --> 01:13:36,092
That's your choice.

970
01:13:36,133 --> 01:13:38,008
Don't do it. No!

971
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:39,925
No!

972
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:42,360
Red Shoes!

973
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:44,633
Promise to me, you'll let him go.

974
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:48,092
Oh absolutely.
When the third bell chimes,

975
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,217
everything will be just
like it used to be.

976
01:13:51,342 --> 01:13:53,633
No! No no no.

977
01:13:55,842 --> 01:13:57,633
Save my papa for me.

978
01:14:08,092 --> 01:14:09,592
Red Shoes!

979
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:29,008
A legendary handsome knight,
fearless rescuer of princesses.

980
01:14:29,133 --> 01:14:34,217
Sitting in a tree,
not getting K - I - S - I - N - G - D.

981
01:14:35,383 --> 01:14:37,050
Burn. I can't spell.

982
01:14:39,383 --> 01:14:40,842
You don't have to do this.

983
01:14:40,883 --> 01:14:42,967
Just take the shoes and let us go.

984
01:14:43,425 --> 01:14:46,175
I wish. They're made of pure magic apple.

985
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:49,300
The fruit of temptation and want.
They feed on your desires

986
01:14:49,342 --> 01:14:53,800
Once they give you what you desire,
the bond is permanent.

987
01:14:54,008 --> 01:14:56,258
That's not true. She took
them off in the river.

988
01:14:56,342 --> 01:14:58,008
That doesn't make any sense.

989
01:14:58,050 --> 01:15:02,675
How could she possibly want to save you
more than she wanted to be beautiful?

990
01:15:02,925 --> 01:15:05,008
What did you do to her?

991
01:15:05,258 --> 01:15:07,175
Did you cast a spell?

992
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,842
What's going to happen to her?

993
01:15:10,883 --> 01:15:15,800
Well, once she eats the apple, its magic
will turn her into a magic apple tree.

994
01:15:15,842 --> 01:15:18,925
The first bell, nothing really happens,
but very dramatic.

995
01:15:19,133 --> 01:15:21,425
The tree bears fruit,
and the second bell...

996
01:15:21,467 --> 01:15:23,675
Oh! Excitement mounts!

997
01:15:23,925 --> 01:15:25,883
The morning sun touches the fruit

998
01:15:26,008 --> 01:15:28,592
turning it into a new
pair of red shoes

999
01:15:28,633 --> 01:15:31,592
And number three, the circle of life!

1000
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:32,967
And then what?

1001
01:15:33,092 --> 01:15:36,592
Regina will be the most
beautiful person in the kingdom.

1002
01:15:36,967 --> 01:15:37,883
Forever.

1003
01:15:37,925 --> 01:15:40,800
I don't care about her,
what about Snow White?

1004
01:15:40,967 --> 01:15:45,175
The tree withers and dies,
and so does Snow White.

1005
01:15:45,217 --> 01:15:47,008
No!

1006
01:15:47,133 --> 01:15:48,842
Yes!

1007
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:53,383
Oh, I'm rotten! I'm dying.

1008
01:16:10,258 --> 01:16:13,092
Why don't you come back and play?

1009
01:16:19,425 --> 01:16:20,800
Not so fast.

1010
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:31,675
It's gonna hurt.

1011
01:16:35,342 --> 01:16:38,383
Oh yeah! Stretch it out.

1012
01:16:49,967 --> 01:16:51,175
Uh-oh.

1013
01:16:55,467 --> 01:16:56,633
Smoke! Smoke!

1014
01:16:56,842 --> 01:16:58,800
We're here, bitch. Are you okay?

1015
01:16:58,842 --> 01:17:00,300
Yeah.

1016
01:17:00,883 --> 01:17:02,883
I never thought I'd say this,

1017
01:17:03,592 --> 01:17:05,883
but I'm so glad to be chubby
and green again.

1018
01:17:06,675 --> 01:17:09,883
Seven to one.
I like those odds.

1019
01:17:10,092 --> 01:17:11,133
Let's go.

1020
01:17:13,092 --> 01:17:15,092
We like those odds even better.

1021
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:19,675
Are you up to this, muchacho?

1022
01:17:20,842 --> 01:17:23,217
You finally pulled out Excalibur.

1023
01:17:23,342 --> 01:17:27,467
Oh, yes, yes. I did it.
That's exactly how it went down.

1024
01:17:27,508 --> 01:17:29,758
Here you go Merlin.
You're gonna need these.

1025
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:30,800
Thanks.

1026
01:17:36,508 --> 01:17:38,800
Here comes the sun.

1027
01:17:39,258 --> 01:17:41,092
Now let's all get dwarfed.

1028
01:17:45,008 --> 01:17:49,508
Ah, this is where your
fairy tale ends, trolls.

1029
01:17:54,133 --> 01:17:55,133
You missed.

1030
01:18:31,967 --> 01:18:33,717
Au revoir, mirror!

1031
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,050
Finally.

1032
01:18:58,717 --> 01:19:01,425
It's a good day to break a curse.

1033
01:19:03,092 --> 01:19:05,300
Eternal Beauty.

1034
01:19:18,508 --> 01:19:19,508
I'm sorry

1035
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:21,383
Snow White.

1036
01:19:24,467 --> 01:19:27,675
Ahhh!

1037
01:19:54,675 --> 01:19:57,383
Extraordinary! No more carrots for me.

1038
01:20:03,758 --> 01:20:04,717
Woah! We're back!

1039
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:05,800
Yippee!

1040
01:20:16,217 --> 01:20:17,217
Papa?

1041
01:20:27,342 --> 01:20:28,717
Snow White?

1042
01:20:31,008 --> 01:20:32,092
Oh papa!

1043
01:20:32,217 --> 01:20:33,217
Snow!

1044
01:20:38,467 --> 01:20:39,467
Wait.

1045
01:20:39,633 --> 01:20:40,883
Where's Merlin?

1046
01:20:41,008 --> 01:20:42,675
I'm so sorry.

1047
01:20:43,133 --> 01:20:47,092
He sacrificed himself to stop Regina.

1048
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:49,217
Merlin, no!

1049
01:20:52,258 --> 01:20:53,800
Merlin!

1050
01:21:54,258 --> 01:21:55,883
I thought you were gone.

1051
01:21:56,717 --> 01:22:01,008
You're the most beautiful
woman in the world.

1052
01:22:02,842 --> 01:22:05,342
With my eyes open

1053
01:22:07,092 --> 01:22:08,550
or closed.

1054
01:22:19,842 --> 01:22:20,842
No.

1055
01:22:38,217 --> 01:22:40,050
I got Merlined.

1056
01:23:05,217 --> 01:23:06,842
You're a prince, Merlin.

1057
01:23:14,425 --> 01:23:17,092
Yeah, that Merlin.

1058
01:23:17,508 --> 01:23:20,508
The one who's not really your type.

1059
01:23:24,258 --> 01:23:26,842
I kind of liked the short
and green Merlin.

1060
01:23:29,258 --> 01:23:31,800
But I'm still that Merlin inside.

1061
01:23:32,883 --> 01:23:35,508
Yes, yes you are.

1062
01:23:54,050 --> 01:23:55,675
Any idea who that girl is?

1063
01:26:08,758 --> 01:26:09,967
Huh?

1064
01:26:19,842 --> 01:26:22,050
Ooh. Not Again!
