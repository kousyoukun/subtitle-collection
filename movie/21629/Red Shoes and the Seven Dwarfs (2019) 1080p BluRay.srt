re-written by rabbit_01

00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,600
This, is Fairy Tale Island.

3
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,180
A magical land of princes and princesses

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,380
witches and monsters.

5
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,730
Accidents and strange events
happen all the time.

6
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,280
And that's when people call us.

7
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:46,360
The Fearless Seven, the greatest
heroes on Fairy Tale Island.

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,700
Especially me, Merlin.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,330
But everything changed
the day we defeated a dragon

10
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,250
and saved a Princess.

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,050
We thought we'd saved a witch,
so, we attacked her.

12
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,260
But we were wrong.

13
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,220
She wasn't a witch, she was a princess.

14
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,600
The Fairy Princess!

15
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,530
How were we supposed to know?
She looks like a witch,

16
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,630
and everyone knows that a
princess doesn't look like a witch.

17
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,230
Anyways, she wanted to teach us a lesson,
so she put a curse on us.

18
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,400
And this was a nasty one.

19
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,990
that turned us into little ugly green
monsters whenever people looked at us.

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,280
And the only way to break the curse

21
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:35,330
is to get a kiss from the
most beautiful woman in the world.

22
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,670
Are you kidding me?

23
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,410
With this face?

24
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,260
Hello, your majesty.

25
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,140
- Good morning ma'am.
- Good morning ma'am.

26
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,020
Magic tree, magic tree...

27
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:45,110
Let this morning be the time
that you perform your duty,

28
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:58,400
of bringing me the shoes
of youthful eternal... beauty.

29
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,670
Yes!

30
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,680
Change me!

31
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,510
Finally!

32
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,560
Not again! How long must I wait?

33
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,400
- No. - Clear these away.

34
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,190
Uh-oh.

35
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,400
Heads off.
Uh-oh.

36
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,980
Heads off.

37
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,730
Pull yourself together.

38
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,570
Here you are.

39
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,530
Oh? Thanks!

40
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,230
That wasn't here before.
What is she up to now?

41
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,030
Huh?

42
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,770
Huh?

43
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,110
You weren't here before.

44
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,740
Whatever.

45
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,700
Oh! Oww!

46
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,870
Yes!

47
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,410
I can't believe my beloved daughter
Snow White has turned eighteen.

48
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:19,300
I only wish her mother could see the kind of
smart and beautiful young woman she's become.

49
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,770
Strange thing happened during the party.

50
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,690
The castle guards brought in
a woman named Regina.

51
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,690
They said she was a witch,
but she was too beautiful to be a witch.

52
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,240
I have married Regina.
Everything feels so perfect!

53
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:44,250
Except for Regina's strange looking mirror.
There's something not quite right.

54
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,130
People around the castle have been
disappearing, one by one.

55
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,920
Is it because of that peculiar mirror?

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,970
I saw it with my own eyes,
Regina talking to a tree.

57
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,340
She must be a witch!

58
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,690
I should send Snow away to a safer place.

59
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,940
My dear Snow, by the time you read this,
my fate will be uncertain.

60
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,110
She's coming for me now.

61
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,900
I only hope you can find the
Fearless Seven, and ask them for help.

62
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,660
Apples...

63
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,780
... the most suspicious of fruits.

64
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Oh,

65
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,500
Papa, where are you?

66
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,790
But they don't look dangerous.

67
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,620
Regina?

68
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,820
No, my shoes! Get her!

69
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,500
- Can I borrow this?
- Okay.

70
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,530
Thanks!

71
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,130
What?

72
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,800
Nooo!!!!!

73
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,940
Short, chubby, and green.

74
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,820
Green is like an ogre.

75
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,070
Blue or yellow could've made us look cute.
And cuddly.

76
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,950
Quit your complaining, Merlin!

77
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,790
I'm figuring out how to take this curse
and kick it where the sun don't shine.

78
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,410
Listen, we need to find the most
beautifullest princess to kiss us,

79
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,440
and we've just about run out of options.

80
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,510
How would a beautiful woman
even see you, Mister Invisible?

81
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,510
- What was that?
- Some kind of bird?

82
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,190
Magic mirror, full of wisdom,

83
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,360
who's the fairest in the Kingdom?

84
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,610
The woman who wears the red shoes.

85
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,580
And side note, wisdom and
kingdom don't really rhyme.

86
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,370
Cut the sass and tell me her name!

87
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,240
How should I know?
I don't get out much.

88
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,580
Well, you are the magic mirror.

89
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,260
Magic is just my first name,
it's short for Magichard. Like Richard.

90
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,710
What can you do then?

91
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,300
I just reflect what I see,
the truth. The truth is,

92
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,220
that you should see yourself right now.
Right now!

93
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,720
Watch it.

94
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:57,400
Distribute wanted posters to every town,
village, valley, forth and forge in the kingdom,

95
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,230
and find her!

96
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,740
I feel my power draining.

97
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,700
I don't have much time.
The aging is accelerating.

98
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,120
And only three bumbling
bits of kindling for help.

99
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,330
Perhaps you should recruit another, someone
who stands to gain from your success.

100
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,370
What about this fellow?

101
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,410
Interesting.

102
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,050
Tell me more, Magichard.

103
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,230
Hey hey, Over here! Over here!

104
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,760
See, see. Come! Very quick.

105
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,260
Look at this. Look, look, look.

106
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,390
What is it?

107
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,110
I know a lot about silhouettes,

108
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,490
and I think this shape is a witch.

109
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,940
Let's not jump to conclusions.
Yes, it could be a witch.

110
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,900
...Or

111
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,900
Ya. It's a witch

112
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,990
The witch who cursed us?

113
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,080
Let's catch her and make
her break the spell!

114
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:10,400
En garde!

115
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,350
Wands where I can see 'em, witch!

116
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,350
Fraulein!

117
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,400
No No No! Stop!

118
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,740
I get you some revenge!

119
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,700
Beautiful!

120
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,870
I didn't know anyone could be so beautiful.

121
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,500
How did she end up with us?

122
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,730
Hello, dear lady. Welcome to my
home slash command post.

123
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,380
I have six room mates
but my name's on the lease.

124
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,840
I pay the rent.

125
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,450
Your home? Oh my gosh,
I am... I am so sorry.

126
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,360
I was starving and...

127
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,390
No need to apologize.

128
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,280
We didn't mean to interrupt
your stolen meal.

129
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,500
If you're still hungry,
I can whip up something simple.

130
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,620
- You see I, marinate the solution and...

131
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,780
Who is that?

132
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,100
Uhh...

133
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,370
Who?

134
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,330
Wow. I look so different.

135
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,380
I mean, my face, and my waist,
and my waist and...

136
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,500
My waist?

137
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,130
Oh my gosh! What happened to me?

138
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,680
Oh, I must've gotten up so
quickly my back is killing me.

139
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,430
You mean your head, right?

140
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,400
- Do you need help?
- No, I'm fine.

141
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:54,200
Is that really what I look like?
In the mirror? Do you see the same thing?

142
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,030
You're beautiful, miss.

143
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,740
Like an angel!

144
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,910
Really?

145
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,210
Could it be?

146
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,340
Excuse me, but who are you?

147
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,880
Oh... I'm Snow...

148
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,000
Snot?

149
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,630
No no no no no no.

150
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,920
My name is...

151
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,090
R-Red Shoes.

152
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,390
Yep. It's me. Red Shoes.

153
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:22,020
Cool name, but, by any chance
would that be Princess Red Shoes?

154
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,820
Of course, she's a princess!

155
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,830
How could she be so beautiful if she weren't?

156
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,770
Obviously! Right, miss?

157
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,820
Obviously, I mean I am a princess.

158
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,320
Who are you guys?

159
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,440
I'm Merlin.

160
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,010
Part time hero, full time romantic.

161
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,130
And this is Jack, Hans, Arthur,
Pino, Noki and Kio.

162
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,750
No way, your names are
the same as the F-Seven.

163
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,600
The Fearless Seven.
I'm looking for them.

164
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,410
Let me guess,
Merlin's your favourite?

165
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,420
No, not really.

166
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,640
No, that Merlin's not your type.

167
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,640
You seem like a Prince Arthur fan to me.

168
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:04,310
Honestly, none of them are
really my type.

169
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,050
Oh.

170
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,980
Well. That's fine.

171
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,400
Because we're not them, we're
actually completely different people.

172
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:17,210
In no way are we the same guys, put under
a curse, and changed into different forms.

173
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,410
But only if someone looks at us,
It's very complicated.

174
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,480
Right. We're all clear.

175
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,210
So how can I assist you, my fair lady?

176
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,210
I need to find my father,

177
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,210
and I know that the F-Seven can help.

178
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,220
We know the F-Seven very well,
and their schedule is fully booked.

179
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,220
Leave it to me,
I'll find your father within the month.

180
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,860
I can do it in one week.

181
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,610
- Four days! - Three days!

182
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,930
- Two days! - One!

183
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:42,900
Oomph!

184
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,140
I already found your
father like, two weeks ago.

185
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,310
Really?

186
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,370
I just need a few days
to get him across state lines.

187
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,400
I seriously need to find my dad.

188
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,860
Hold on. Nobody has seen the F-Seven
in over a year, right?

189
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,320
You're not going to find them now,
we're your best bet.

190
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,080
Wow. No-ones offered to
help me for such a long time.

191
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,220
You guys are awesome

192
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,580
Really? You think we are awesome?

193
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:14,930
Yeah, you guys are caring, and sweet, and...

194
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,800
And not completely hideous to look at?

195
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,180
No, you guys are totally adorable.

196
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,100
I think I hit her too hard.

197
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,020
But she is beautiful.

198
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,650
She can help me break the curse.

199
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,900
Who is coming to my birthday party?

200
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,880
Has Ariel RSVP'd?

201
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,590
She says she can't make it, sir.
She has to wax her legs.

202
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,910
But she's a mermaid!

203
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,130
What about Sleeping Beauty?

204
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,380
Doctor's appointment.

205
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,550
- Is she sick?
- Says she has insomnia.

206
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,850
If she's not gonna sleep,
she can come to our party.

207
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,890
What about Rapunzel?

208
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,060
And don't tell me she's
getting her hair done.

209
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,300
Nope. It's something called, uh, book.

210
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,350
Princess Cruise?

211
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,520
That's a ship, sir.

212
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,230
Princess Leia?

213
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,430
She's a general!

214
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,180
I demand glorious guests!

215
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,650
How can I be any more unpopular!

216
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,350
And I don't understand, why?

217
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,660
Greetings, Prince Average.

218
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,240
It's pronounced Avv-vous-rarge.

219
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,740
Sure it is.

220
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,630
If you're here for the 'We Love
Our Peasants' group giveaway,

221
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,540
that motion is ended.
Grab your wrinkles and go.

222
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,700
Move along.

223
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,560
Do you think that people would respect you,

224
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:43,450
if you celebrated your birthday with
a beautiful woman on your arm?

225
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,940
Finally, someone talking sense!

226
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,820
This horrible crone gets it!

227
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,520
May I suggest inviting

228
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,110
this young lady?

229
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,950
She's beautiful, when can she get here?

230
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,820
Well, that's up to you.

231
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,530
You see, she's stolen something from me.

232
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:09,620
You find her, bring her along with you,
and you won't look like such a loser,

233
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,920
and I get my shoes back.

234
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,100
Fear not, loyal hag.

235
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,250
I, Prince Average,

236
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,260
shall find this fugitive,
and make her pay for her crimes,

237
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,420
by making her attend my birthday party.

238
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,970
There shall be balloons!

239
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,450
I just thought of it.
Let's have a lot of balloons!

240
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,640
What a buffoon.

241
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,200
It looks just like papa.

242
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,620
Papa won't recognise me.

243
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,960
Why won't... why won't these
shoes just come off?

244
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,310
Yes, this is me.

245
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:22,280
Would you like to join me
in a moisturising mask?

246
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,400
Oh, thanks, oh. But I am...

247
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,310
Oh!

248
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,370
So tired.

249
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,700
Are you sure?

250
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,670
It's very important to take
care of your skin.

251
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,700
Positive.

252
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,210
But this is the finest French
recipe meant to hydrate skin.

253
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,920
It is made of French poopee!

254
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,260
Papa?

255
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:49,760
Hmm. A spell that makes you fall in love.

256
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,510
Oh, there it is.

257
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,140
Merlin! Have you seen my cook book?

258
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,390
Have you checked in the kitchen?

259
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,940
Ah, silly me! The kitchen. Of course!

260
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,360
Now, where was I?

261
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,400
Merlin, have you seen my moisturizer?

262
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,380
- It's nowhere to be... - No!

263
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,590
Whatever it is, I haven't seen it.
Now please, go away.

264
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,700
Someone's got anger management issues.

265
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,380
Getting a kiss was never
a problem with this face.

266
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,220
Red Shoes?

267
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,590
Papa?

268
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,010
Papa? Are you there?

269
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:33,970
Papa?

270
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:01,210
Boys! I'm telling you. Sweet treats are
the way to a woman's heart.

271
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,730
It works! I call it, an auto portrait.

272
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,390
I call it, the duplicatertron.

273
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,900
I call it, selfie!

274
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,610
Red Shoes must love it!

275
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,110
Monsieur, monsieur.

276
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,810
She doesn't want sweets and selfies.

277
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,310
Women want diamonds.

278
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
Merlin?

279
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,610
The Book of Spells To Make You Fall In Love?

280
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,410
Okay, big, terrifying, wooden bunny.

281
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,910
You're a nice bunny.

282
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,920
You're a Vegan bunny, right?

283
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,880
What was that? Lightning?

284
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,510
Actually, it's called magic. I do it.

285
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,800
Really? Then do some!

286
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,550
¶ Darling...

287
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,600
¶ Wish you could see what can I see

288
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,900
¶ Miles ahead just you and me

289
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,280
¶ To infinity

290
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,370
Keep running, and whatever
you do, don't look back.

291
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,700
But I can't leave without you.

292
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,200
You're looking back. Don't do that.

293
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
But...

294
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,040
Hate to zap you longears,

295
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,710
But I need to impress a beautiful woman.

296
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,060
Big, scary bunny! Over here!

297
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,090
Red! Stop putting yourself in...

298
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,970
...danger...

299
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,440
Arthur! I got you.

300
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,170
It's no use, Red Shoes.

301
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,880
I'm slippin' away. Not much time...

302
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,050
Just... need to... use that core of mine...

303
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,590
I see the light at the end of the funnel.

304
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,310
Time for me to kick the bucket

305
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,350
I had a good run. I was God blessed.

306
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,390
Oh, I used to be able to bench two fifty!

307
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,780
Before I go, how about a farewell kiss?

308
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,850
Red Shoes! Thank goodness you're safe.

309
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,830
Do you need CPR? I'm basically an expert.

310
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,120
And don't worry, I brushed my teeth.

311
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,400
No, No, No. I'm fine, but Arthur, he's stuck.

312
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,910
He tried to save me and...

313
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,400
Would you get up?

314
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,440
What? He's not hurt?

315
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,030
- Only his pride.
- Seriously Arthur?

316
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,580
You need to find a better
way to hit on girls.

317
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,800
Stand back! I may have to risk my life.

318
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,980
Someone call for three inventors?

319
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,600
For three geniuses?

320
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,690
That sounds like us!

321
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,400
Everyone came runnin' to help,
great, just great.

322
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,170
Everyone except Merlin, that is.

323
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,400
Ah! Super, there he is now.

324
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:19,920
Where have you been?

325
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,710
Something awful could've happened
to Red if I hadn't shown up.

326
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,830
You?

327
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,790
Don't even go there!

328
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,330
I saved her first.

329
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,380
- Right?
- I was worried about you.

330
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,440
I was worried about me too.

331
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,600
- But mostly you.
- No-one needs to worry.

332
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,890
Arthur's here. Please, my lady.

333
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,300
Um... Okay.

334
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,650
You shouldn't go into the
forest by yourself.

335
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,900
It's a nightmarish landsacpe, fit only for
bloodthirsty warriors like myself.

336
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,440
...And squirrels.

337
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,320
I thought I saw my father.

338
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,740
Turned out, just to be that big bunny.

339
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:08,910
Well, if you ever make such a dangerous
and weird mistake again,

340
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,250
just know that I can protect you.

341
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,060
This's very kind.

342
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:17,710
And if you really want to express
your gratitude, you can...

343
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,980
Oh, I am so sorry.

344
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:27,310
This was much slappier than
I intended it to be.

345
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,100
Oh! It happens. No problem.

346
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,060
Maybe an apology kiss then?

347
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,110
Bravo mon ami!

348
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:38,990
Nice try.

349
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,200
Red Shoes.

350
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:49,440
Gentlemen, to break this curse, we're going
to have to work as a tightly knit team.

351
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,440
Which means, you do everything I say.

352
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,100
- Excuse? - Huh? - What? - No.

353
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:53,890
You got to be kidding.

354
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,170
Hans and Jack will search around the Dismal Lake.

355
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,130
Triplets! You search the Caves Of Despair.

356
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,300
Red Shoe and I, will go to Golden Goose Avenue.

357
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:07,100
Golden Goose Avenue, which happens
to be your go to place for dates.

358
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,450
We are going to focus on the mission.

359
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,890
And then see where the evening takes us.

360
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:16,360
The only thing you're going to shop for
on Golden Goose Avenue, is rejection.

361
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,070
And you can't even afford that.

362
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,830
I like my odds. You saw what she did.

363
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,200
An expression of affection.

364
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,200
Every woman shows it differently.

365
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,840
You took your shot. You got slapped.

366
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,920
May I remind you

367
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,830
that this is the closest thing to a
kiss anyone's had since the curse.

368
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,510
Let's work together to guide
Red Shoes' feelings towards me

369
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,390
so we can break the curse.

370
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,710
What about the rest of us?

371
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,260
After I resume my princely form,

372
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,890
the word about F-Seven will be out.

373
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:48,680
Ladies will be begging to kiss your green mugs.

374
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,560
- Really?
- Sounds reasonable.

375
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,150
I'll bring the gelato!

376
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,770
Getting one kiss sure is easier
than getting seven.

377
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,740
This is not a plan,
he's just out for himself!

378
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,790
A half baked plan is better than none.

379
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,400
Don't worry Merlin,
I have a big assignment for you.

380
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,660
Big assignment?

381
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,160
Here you go. I drew these up last night.

382
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:11,910
I can't tell if this drawing is terrible, or

383
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,250
really avant garde.

384
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,580
Oh, my neighbor's a great art teacher.

385
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,140
Pablo Picassover?

386
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:21,960
One thing's for sure,
daddy's on the big side...

387
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,130
...of big.

388
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,720
You must take after your mother.

389
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,180
No, I look a lot like papa...Oh!

390
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:35,430
Yeah, my mother. Gosh! We... exactly! Twins!

391
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:39,120
Alright. You know the plan. Let's move.

392
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,940
Deploy! Thunderdwarfs are go!

393
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,900
And where d'ya think you're going?

394
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,950
Your post is right there.

395
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,620
You'll watch the savage monster.
I call him Vicious!

396
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,200
I call him Woodbottom.

397
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,730
Do not worry Merlin. We'll make
sure you get kissed too.

398
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,160
Eventually.

399
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,970
We'll split up here.

400
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,750
Alright, see you later.

401
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,590
I know exactly where we should
look to find your father.

402
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,340
Really? Where?

403
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,520
Daddy!

404
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
Wow!

405
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,990
Is this what I think it is?

406
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:25,070
I present Excalibur, the legendary
sword trapped in this rock for centuries.

407
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,830
Waiting for a man of great
strength to release it.

408
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,120
It says 'Do not attempt to remove by force'.

409
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,700
... Oh, right. I guess. Ahem.

410
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:41,130
The truth is, I realized you were the woman
of my destiny the first time I saw you.

411
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,170
I thought if I could show you my strength

412
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,630
I would be worthy of your affections.

413
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,540
Oh!

414
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,030
Oops, I'll put it back.

415
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,720
No No No! Can I have it?

416
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,280
Oh, Arthur, it's just beginner's luck.

417
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,870
You want me to, maybe pull
it out for you again?

418
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,370
No, I'm not humiliated at all.

419
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,200
Let's go.

420
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,550
Don't look at me like that,
I'm the real prisoner here.

421
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,890
What? You hungry?

422
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,930
And fetch!

423
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,650
Hop along, big guy!

424
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,610
There's no way Arthur is
breaking this curse alone!

425
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,670
Woah!

426
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,210
Arthur, where're you going?

427
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,450
Okay.

428
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,180
See you later.

429
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,350
Hi.

430
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,180
Oh, look at what you made me do!

431
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,310
You...

432
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,730
I'm sorry.

433
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,940
...made me make it perfect.

434
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Thank you.

435
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,900
Woah!

436
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,790
I'm so sorry.

437
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,740
No, don't be. I am sorry.

438
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,400
Are you alright?

439
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,520
And...

440
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,330
...don't worry about this.

441
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,250
What?

442
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,830
Ta-da!

443
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,560
Excuse me, have you seen this man?

444
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,090
¶ I'm feeling good today

445
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,090
¶ And nothing standing in my way

446
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,450

00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,310

448
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,520
¶ Everybody wants to stop and stare

449
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,860
¶ People talk but I don't care

450
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,190
¶ Everybody wants to stop and stare

451
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,280

00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,910
Arthur, I was thinking.

461
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,670
What if I just pull out the Excalibur for you?

462
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,200
Our secret.

463
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,130
Really? We have a secret now?

464
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,760
Yeah.

465
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,410
I like a girl who can keep things classified.

466
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,710
Let's find your pops, friend.

467
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,920
'Bye guys.

468
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
What?

469
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,340
Hey, you.

470
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,840
No.

471
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,050
Hey!

472
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,680
Stop!

473
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
Come on!

474
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,170
Oh, you guys don't have to help.

475
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,400
That's not her. Come on.

476
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,450
Sorry miss.

477
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,900
Red Shoes! Where has she gone?

478
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,700
Where's Red Shoes?

479
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,400
That's what I'd like to know.

480
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,190
Wait a minute.

481
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,870
Who said you could leave your post?

482
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,940
I'm just walking the bunny.

483
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,780
Red Shoes, where are you?

484
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,160
Hey, have you seen this girl?

485
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,050
Look what I found

486
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,380
Oh, those're mine.
Can I, actually have my shoes back?

487
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,520
No way. You're not serious, are you?

488
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:43,300
I'm really not in the mood,
Can you just, please give them back to me?

489
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,820
Ha! They won't even fit on you.

490
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,940
They're gonna fit me better
than they fit you.

491
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:48,970
Hey!

492
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,060
Red Shoes!

493
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,980
Guys! Guys, I'm here.

494
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,650
- Red Shoes!
- Red Shoes! Where are you?

495
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,570
Even the hideous dwarfs won't help you.

496
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,870
Those dwarfs are not hideous.

497
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,620
And I don't need anyone to help me.

498
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,510
Freeze! Put the shoes down.

499
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,100
Get on your knees and put
your hands behind your head.

500
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,930
On second thought, they're yours.

501
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,090
There's no need to push me in a corner

502
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,180
Super scary.

503
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,610
Your red shoes, milady.

504
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,400
Thank you.

505
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:42,280
Excuse me, miss, have we met?

506
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,120
Well, that's kind of a complicated question.

507
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,620
Red Shoes!

508
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,790
Gotta go. Be safe.

509
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,020
Guys!

510
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,150
Where has she gone?

511
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,570
Red Shoes!

512
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,980
Stop!

513
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,860
Hold on!

514
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Wait a minute.

515
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,790
Gotcha now, don't we?

516
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,710
I don't get it.

517
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,840
Now we know how fast a
bunny can hop in a pinch.

518
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,630
Thank you for helping me, Merlin.

519
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,210
A pleasure, milady.

520
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,720
But I also did it for us.

521
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,140
By the way, what is this?

522
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,220
Gosh, it seems silly but...

523
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,350
... It's my shoes

524
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,770
- They're magical.
- I know, they're fabulous.

525
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,370
But why're they after you?

526
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,710
No, my shoes, they're actually made of magic.

527
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,070
Red Shoes!

528
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,400
Are you a criminal?

529
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,530
No, of course not.

530
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,370
I knew a girl this pretty couldn't
possibly be a criminal.

531
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,910
Look, we should head out now,
there could be more guards around any minute.

532
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,040
Don't worry about them,
I've got these bad boys.

533
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:22,340
This is gonna make it so much
harder to find my dad.

534
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,340
I have an idea!

536

the very first time

537

541
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,300
Ta-da!

542
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,170
Oh wow!

543
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,720
What do you think?

544
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,890
That is amazing.

545
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,230
Thank you.

00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:39,370
Alright, let's go.

551
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,600
- We've been walking for hours.
- And we'll keep walking 'till we find them.

552
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,150
Now we got her.

553
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,030
- Are they gone?
- Shh. Who cares? -

554
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,740
C'mon. Let's go see.

555
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,790
Look at that.

556
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,780
- Wow!
- Wow!

557
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:21,830
Awsome!

558
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,890
Who's that?

559
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,290
It's the girl's father.

560
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,750
But where's the girl?

561
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,920
It says to go to Risky Rock,
so she must be there.

562
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,800
Why Risky Rock?

563
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,150
We should ask the girl.

564
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,550
Perfect! Where's the girl?

565
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,140
It says to go to Risky Rock,
so she must be there.

566
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,730
But, why Risky Rock?

567
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,130
We should ask the girl.

568
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:42,270
Umm...
We should ask the girl.

569
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,130
Umm...

570
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,320
Where's the girl?

571
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:46,950
It says to go to Risky Rock,
so she must be there.

572

Oww!

What was that for?

578
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,270
You, sir, are sabotaging my
relationship with Red Shoes.

579
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,570
What relationship are
you talking about?

580
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,150
Red Shoes and I share a secret.

581
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,140
I would tell you what it is,
but it's a secret.

582

While you're busy keeping secrets,
I'm going to break my curse.

You're nothing without
your spells, magic boy.

And you're nothing without Excalibur.

585
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,130
You're not waiting for someone to
pull it out for you, are you?

Hans, you shouldn't have.

589

Something sweet, for someone sweeter.

590
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,650
This is spectacular!

591
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,390
Oh, it's nothing.
Just let me know what you want.

592

Any time, for the rest of your life.
Do you like fondue?

Behold! Carved by the finest jewellers
out of all the jewellers I know

594
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,530
which is a lot.

595
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,370
Pretty.

596
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,990
And it's yours, Miss Shoes,
yours in exchange for nothing.

597
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,990
Make it a kiss.

598
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,120
That's really sweet Jack,
but I can't accept it.

599
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:29,180
I don't want your jewells,
only your good intentions.

600
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:32,630
My intentions are more than good,
they're super bonne.

Attention! Hideous trolls!

604
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:42,070
Is it dwarfs with an 'f',
or dwarves, with a 'v'?

605
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,640
I want to use whatever's more offensive.

606
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,730
Oh, it's that loser, Prince Average.

607

is a gorgeous wanted criminal.

I hereby command that all of you exit
the premises and surrender post haste.

612
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,250
Fail to comply, and you will

One.

615
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,410
Two.

616
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,960
I lied. Charge!

617
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,000
Am I the person you want?

618
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,860
Yes, yes you are.

619
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:41,610
Though I don't know if you're a person
or a vision of beauty, some kind of angelic

620
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:45,620
thing with wings. Angelic wing things?

621
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:49,440
I will come with you,
but only after you release my friends.

622
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,670
Do it. Do it!

623
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,440
Now, here's the good news.
It's my birthday!

624
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:59,050
And you are going to be
the belle of the ball.

625
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:02,840
The invitation sounds great,
really. But...

626
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,180
It wasn't an invitation,
more of an order.

627
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,280
Prepare the lady's carriage.

628
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,860
She said she doesn't want to go, Average.

629
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:11,810
Avv-vous-rarge!

630
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,560
Don't troll me, Troll.

631
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,080
Ah! So rude.

632
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,370
I couldn't agree more.
Subjects these days.

633
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,530
Now. Shall we?

634
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,120
Get her!

635
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,050
You hold off the guards, and
I'll get her out of here.

636
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,120
No, I'm faster. You stay
here and buy us time.

637
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,260
Here's a thought.

638
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:44,640
Stop fighting and fight!

639
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,220
What's the plan?

640
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,740
Rescue Red Shoes.

641
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,680
Like the old days, guys.

642
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,680
Arthur!

643
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,850
Can we get this over with?
They're just dwarfs!

644
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,620
Did you guys hear something?

645
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:00,670
Come on!

646
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,070
Duck!

647
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,530
Hi, guards, are we taking a break?

648
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,750
... well, FYI

649
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,040
They're getting away!

650
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,040
No!

651
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:50,390
Who's throwin' vegetables?

652
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:57,810
Yeah! You just got Merlined!

653
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:06,990
Run!

654
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,400
Jack!

655
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,120
Duck!

656
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,800
I'm so sorry. You alright?

657
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,180
No. I'm not.

658
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:38,890
Gentlemen, he surrenders.

659
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,100
What?

660
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:11,550
Engines. Full power.

661
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:12,630
Shields up.

662
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,140
Turn on the mini frizzer.

663
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:35,400
Superhero landing!

664
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:36,530
Hooray for us!

665
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,950
- We did it!
- It was mostly me.

666
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:39,990
Yeah!

667
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,500
What?

668
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,210
You've got to be kidding.

669
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:48,800
Finally the big guns, thank you.

670
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:50,050
Fire!

671
00:44:58,350 --> 00:44:59,350
Fire!

672
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,810
Ooh, close.

673
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:08,940
The cannonball. Not you.

674
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:11,990
timeout, timeout.
Everyone, timeout.

675
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,670
You almost blew her up, and she can't
come to my party if you blow her up.

676
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,820
Sorry, sir.

677
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,660
Alright. Time back in.

678
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,870
Surrender monsters!

679
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:22,080
No! Wait!

680
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:55,950
Oh. That's pretty cool.

681
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:05,750
Everyone inside. And hurry!

682
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,140
You messed with the wrong prince.

683
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:24,980
There is nothing average about Avv-vous-rarge.

684
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,430
I shall return!

685
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:29,580
On Tuesday.

686
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:31,950
No, wait. I'll check my calendar...

687
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:36,070
Thursday, I shall return Thursday!

688
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,700
We'll be ready.

689
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:39,530
And waiting.

690
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:40,590
Arrivederci!

691
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,620
Ciao for now!

692
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,440
Bye bye!

693
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,200
You just got dwarfed!

694
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:46,370
Is that better? I think Merlined is better.

695
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:07,140
You should have seen the look on his big
ugly face when bunny came running at him.

696
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:10,370
That's how you see everything, isn't it?

697
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,690
With my eyes?

698
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,780
You always talk about
what someone looks like.

699
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,360
I do? I wouldn't say that.

700
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:19,990
But I can't wait for you
to see the real me.

701
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,160
What kind of Merlin is the real you?

702
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:23,780
You might not believe it,

703
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:27,440
but the real me is famous,
handsome, and even popular.

704
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:30,540
Not short, stumpy and green.

705
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:33,970
Yeah, you're short, stumpy and green, but

706
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,930
you're also a wonderful and charming person.

707
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,450
I'm not explaining it right.

708
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:42,140
If you saw the real me,
you'd know exactly what I mean.

709
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,930
I think I can see the real you.

710
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,770
And I like you, just as you are.

711
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,940
That's hilarious.

712
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:56,070
Here, close your eyes,
and imagine the real me.

713
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:59,070
I guarantee you, it'll be different.

714
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:04,370
I do feel something different ..

715
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:05,580
Really?

716
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,000
But eyes opened or closed

717
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,330
to me you're still Merlin.

718
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:16,250
Now tell me, who am I to you?

719
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,380
You're a gift.

720
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:22,720
A gift that'll transform me
into someone amazing.

721
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,510
Just like you're amazing.

722
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:36,820
Actually, I want to show you something too.

723
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,820
You need a hand?

724
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:46,330
Hold on. Nope. Stand back. I got this.

725
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:48,510
...One...

726
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,290
Two, yeah, okay, I need help.

727
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:10,090
Woah. Woah woah woah.

728
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,890
No thankyou.

729
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:21,150
You know what the weird thing is?
They're super comfortable.

730
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,750
Y'know, I'm just saying. Where were
you when the facade was falling?

731
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,910
I mean, that was terrifying.

732
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:31,830
What're you doing here?

733
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:35,750
I have come for my shoes.

734
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:40,410
Well, I had them. I mean I saw them.
But those dwarfs!

735
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,970
It's dwarves with a 'v'.
So you failed?

736
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:47,680
I did not fail, I took a timeout.

737
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,780
Yeah. This is a calculated timeout.

738
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,930
I'm going to return on Thursday,
we all pencilled it in.

739
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,060
Silence!

740
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:54,850
Have a bite.

741
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,850
For strength.

742
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:01,700
Apples, the most suspicious of fruits.

743
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:04,400
I don't have much time, Prince.

744
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,700
You could still have the
best birthday ever,

745
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:10,340
But remember...

746
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:17,000
What's bad for me,
will be very bad for you.

747
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,090
She's gone.

748
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,590
Ah! What's the worst that could happen.

749
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,640
It's kind of sweet.

750
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:49,910
Don't move.

751
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:50,590
Okay.

752
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,710
Pino, Noki Kio, show us what you got.

753
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,670
Okey doky!

754
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,510
Here we go!

755
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,660
Our pleasure.

756
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,420
... here we go, yeah, a little

757
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,590
Oooh a little over here!

758
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,120
Now that looks like a real home.

759
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,110
Yep. I could get used to that.

760
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,530
Uh uh. I cannot.

761
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,200
It's a perfect copy of my drawing.
That's incredible.

762
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:37,790
Let me try.

763
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,320
This will definitely make it easier to
find your dad.

764
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,680
Unfortunately, this thing aint flying.

765
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:44,560
It's grounded.

766
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:45,600
Why does it need to fly?

767
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:48,380
The posters are no good if we
can't distribute them fast.

768
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:52,550
Guys, thankyou so much for
everything you're doing.

769
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:55,050
- My pleasure.
- It's nice.

770
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:05,670
Opening doors!

771
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:24,940
You know Merlin, I feel so
lucky that I've met you.

772
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:27,520
I feel the same way.

773
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:31,280
I feel like anything is possible.

774
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:34,080
¶ Darling

775
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:39,620
¶ Come on out there and take my hand

776
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:43,750
¶ I will show you that I'm your man

777
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:46,750
¶ Is that okay

778
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,670
Merlin! Watch out!

779
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,100
Merlin.

780
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:04,980
Merlin.

781
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:07,270
Merlin!

782
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:09,190
Everything okay?

783
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:10,820
Of course! Sure!

784
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:12,870
Nothing to be embarrassed about.

785
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,130
So why are we even talking about
that when we should be going...

786
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,160
this direction.

787
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,320
Hey wait!

788
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,960
So, about these magic shoes.

789
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,340
Why, are they still bothering you?

790
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:29,380
What kind of magic do
those shoes have?

791
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:32,750
Well .. how do I put this.

792
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,720
Merlin, I used to be strong, really strong.

793
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:39,360
And, I was always proud of that.

794
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:44,450
But, the shoes magic, umm,
it made me a little dainty?

795
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,610
Sorry to hear.

796
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,940
The shoes made me lose
a little bit of weight.

797
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:51,370
It could be worse.

798
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,730
..Okay.

799
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,320
- A lot of weight.
- Ah.

800
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,530
Well, I know what it's like to look different on
the outside from what you feel on the inside.

801
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,250
Merlin, I'd like to give you a
token of my appreciation.

802
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:12,670
Oh, here, hand me one of your spells.

803
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,390
Why?

804
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:16,050
Oh, come on. I'm not going to zap you.

805
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:18,260
Give me a second.

806
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:34,570
There. Consider it your good luck charm.

807
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:39,110
Thank you.

808
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:49,440
Merlin, do you think we'd be happier

809
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,960
if we were our old selves again?

810
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:54,880
Yep. Yep, yep. Definately we would.

811
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:56,300
I don't know.

812
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:59,010
I like how we are.

813
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,140
Right here, just, right now.

814
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,520
Even if I'm an ugly green monster?

815
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:12,600
I don't care about your height
or what colour you are.

816
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,070
And that's the way you feel about me, right?

817
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:20,320
Yes, of course. I mean, duhh!

818
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:25,780
I think we're both just trapped
under the same spell.

819
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:48,180
Wait. Keep your eyes closed
and don't open them until I say.

820
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:50,420
When you open your eyes there will be...

821
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,320
a handsome man in front of you.

822
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:54,830
Someone worthy of you.

823
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,070
Someone you'd be proud to be seen with.

824
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,430
I think you're right.

825
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:02,070
Ready? And...

826
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,570
Oh, it's such a good day to break a curse!

827
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,080
Now!

828
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:10,700
Ta-da!

829
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:13,870
You just got Merlined!

830
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,250
What do you think?

831
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:18,920
Mission impossibly handsome, right?

832
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:24,050
Oh, it's okay,
I know this is a lot to take in.

833
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,940
But you can let your happiness flag fly.

834
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:30,890
This, this is the real me.

835
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:33,890
- It's stupid.
- What?

836
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,270
Wait a minute!

837
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:39,270
My hands are still green sausages.

838
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,570
No! I look the same.

839
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,360
Yes, impossibly handsome.

840
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,570
This doesn't make sense.

841
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,700
You're the most beautiful woman in
the world, why do I look the same?

842
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:52,840
What're you talking about, Merlin?

843
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,290
Do I need a longer kiss?

844
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:55,750
Two kisses?

845
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:58,210
Let's try again.

846
00:57:58,740 --> 00:57:59,740
Umm.

847
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,170
You're not making any sense.

848
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,420
Hurry!

849
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,400
What is that?

850
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,270
This kingdom has a serious
monster problem.

851
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:33,720
Are you alright?

852
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:35,660
No. I'm not.

853
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:44,800
Thank you.

854
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,090
Pleasure, milady.

855
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:49,450
Watch out!

856
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:09,110
Ha-hah! Yes!

857
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,680
What do they want,
besides smashing us?

858
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:18,710
I don't know!

859
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,260
The old me would've nailed that.

860
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:39,140
You just got Merlined!

861
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:51,110
Hurry!

862
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,980
Red, close your eyes.

863
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:09,850
This is no time for kissing, Merlin.

864
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:12,010
Trust me. Close your eyes.

865
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,890
Please, close them!

866
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,980
That was too close.

867
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:23,190
Don't look at me.

868
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:25,370
You see that tree on the
other side of the bridge?

869
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:25,990
Yeah.

870
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:29,040
On my signal, run towards
it as fast as you can.

871
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:30,570
No, I can't leave you here.

872
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:33,950
You have to.
And don't look back, okay?

873
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,520
Look right at that tree until I say it's safe.

874
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:38,210
Promise you won't look.

875
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,710
Okay. I promise.

876
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:42,290
Now!

877
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:14,790
What?

878
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:17,120
You just got Merlined?
Oh. Yes you did.

879
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:47,860
Hey! Locate!

880
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,650
Hey, locate here!

881
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:53,990
You're even more of a blockhead
than Prince Average.

882
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,660
Avv-vous-rarge!

883
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:00,440
Prince Average?

884
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,260
You just got Merlined.

885
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:23,180
Take a look, Red Shoes.

886
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,070
Merlin!

887
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:26,560
I have triumphantly saved the day.

888
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:28,730
Merlin, no!

889
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:32,430
Merlin!

890
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,570
Merlin!

891
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:44,890
Snow White?

892
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,070
Snow White?

893
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:59,280
The thief was Snow White
this whole time?

894
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:02,870
Interesting. She could remove the shoes.

895
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:07,120
You're going after her yourself?

896
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,750
What? Were you going to go?

897
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,960
I get it! I don't have legs.

898
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:17,920
So, here I am.

899
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:20,170
All the real me.

900
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,220
I bet you're disappointed, huh?

901
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:26,480
You're the girl from Golden Goose Avenue.

902
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:27,070
Red Shoes!

903
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,430
That's not my name, it's Snow White.

904
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:33,070
Princess Snow White? So your father is...

905
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:35,520
King White, yeah.

906
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:39,430
By the time I figured out his
new wife Regina was a witch

907
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,280
he'd already disappeared.

908
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:45,340
And the monsters who attacked us

909
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:49,370
were sent by my stepmother
to get these shoes.

910
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:53,620
I guess being beautiful is really
worth that much to her.

911
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,880
Have you thought about
just giving them back?

912
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,510
And give up their magic?

913
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,300
If I'd given up their magic, you wouldn't
have helped me find my father, would you?

914
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:06,600
Would you?

915
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,880
I thought we were both
under the same spell.

916
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:17,400
But I see now that I was wrong.

917
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:23,320
Listen, I can't get into all the details,
but I'm under a curse too.

918
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:25,660
You still don't get it, Merlin.

919
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:29,370
I'm not talking about our curses.

920
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,870
Merlin, I'm talking about
the kind of spell

921
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,170
you never want to break.

922
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,390
He likes you more than he likes me.

923
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:02,630
What would've happened if she'd taken
off her shoes that day in the barn?

924
01:07:02,670 --> 01:07:04,090
You think that's important?

925
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:08,430
I just wonder,

926
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:11,420
what I would've done if I'd
seen the real Snow White.

927
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,060
Seriously?

928
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:15,420
It's still all about appearance for you.

929
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,350
No! Not exactly.

930
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:22,190
But I can't live looking like
you for the rest of my life

931
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:26,650
Kind of proving my point, other me.
Alright. Let's try this.

932
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:29,820
Who do you like more,
Snow White or Red Shoes?

933
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:31,910
Easy, it's Red Shoes.

934
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:34,740
Now, which of us do you
think Red Shoes likes more?

935
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:36,540
Easy, it's me!

936
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,080
Wait. No.

937
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:42,840
It's...

938
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:44,250
you.

939
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:11,070
¶ You came in my life in a high flash of lightning

940
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:16,120
¶ I covered my eyes but there's no use in hiding

941
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:20,290
¶ This feeling has stuck and I couldn't say

942
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:21,620
You're a gift.

943
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,620
A gift that'll transform me

944
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,970
into someone amazing.

945
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,720
¶ This is the start of something so right

946
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:35,760
¶ Suddenly all of the stars have aligned

947
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:40,810
¶ In the right place at the right time

948
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:46,150
¶ This is the start of something so right

949
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:50,950
Well, I know what it's like to look different on
the outside to what we feel on the inside.

950
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:56,400
¶ This is the start of something so right

951
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:09,090
¶ This is the start of something so right

952
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:11,920
Look at that!

953
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,650
The shoes. You're wearing them.

954
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,390
I thought you left.

955
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,140
You should take them off again.

956
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:29,430
I can't.

957
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:33,200
You just had to make things complicated.

958
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:35,620
Maybe this will help.

959
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:38,170
Eat the apple, and they'll slide right off.

960
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,330
Where did you get that?

961
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:41,910
I want to help you, Snow White.

962
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,160
Please.

963
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:50,840
Red Shoes?

964
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:52,410
Merlin?

965
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:54,340
Merlin?

966
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:59,640
What terrible timing you have.

967
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,640
We're gonna have to do this the hard way.

968
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:06,350
Regina?

969
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:12,740
Such a tender family reunion.

970
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:15,200
So sad we can't stay!

971
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:17,110
Red Shoes!

972
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:21,510
Come on, let's go, longears.

973
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:23,090
Hey! Wait for us!

974
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,160
How 'bout you go back
and get the others?

975
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:27,290
And make lots of copies of this.

976
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:28,880
Let's go!

977
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:32,730
We can do this.

978
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:33,760
Yeah!

979
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:38,640
Your power my lady. It has drained you.

980
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:42,600
You think? I don't need
you to tell me how I look.

981
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:44,990
I'm a mirror. It's what I do.

982
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:47,910
M - I - R - O - R.
I can't spell.

983
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:48,940
Enough.

984
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:51,360
Bind her.

985
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,530
It's snack time.

986
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,370
How can you sleep at
a time like this?

987
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:04,720
I'm not supposed to talk
when I have this on,

988
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:08,170
but I got to ask.
Do you think they've kissed yet?

989
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:09,250
I hope so,

990
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:12,290
because it'll feel better to
punch Merlin when he's pretty.

991
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:16,690
We've been waiting for a...
Where have you been?

992
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:17,730
Did you break the curse yet?

993
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,420
Merlin, are you hungry?

994
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:20,760
Those are bears.

995
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:21,790
Ah...

996
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,680
Hi? This is from Merlin.

997
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,040
Wow! This is so cool.

998
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:50,290
Okay, sword.

999
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:55,250
If you think you've humiliated, embarrassed,
and otherwise frustrated me,

1000
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:56,920
you're right.

1001
01:11:57,410 --> 01:12:01,090
But that ends now!

1002
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:12,730
Oh, zut alors. Please end this.

1003
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:28,470
Hey! Wait! You're running the wrong way.

1004
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,830
The castle's over there.

1005
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:47,760
Sit.

1006
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:03,240
Eat this darling, and you'll
get your freedom.

1007
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,740
Where is my father?

1008
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:09,440
Royal loyal little girl,
pining for her papa?

1009
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:14,120
This is getting a little boring, so I need
you to take a bite, and I'll tell you.

1010
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:15,670
I won't let you win.

1011
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:19,550
You've torn apart my family,
and you will not get away with it, Regina.

1012
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:23,450
Ooh, I'm so scared, Snow.

1013
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:26,680
Very well. A different approach.

1014
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:36,350
- Merlin!
- No!

1015
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:39,360
Eat the apple, or watch him die.

1016
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:40,400
That's your choice.

1017
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:42,330
Don't do it. No!

1018
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,240
No!

1019
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:46,690
Red Shoes!

1020
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:48,950
Promise to me, you'll let him go.

1021
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:52,440
Oh absolutely.
When the third bell chimes,

1022
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:55,540
everything will be just
like it used to be.

1023
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:57,960
No! No no no.

1024
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:01,960
Save my papa for me.

1025
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:13,930
Red Shoes!

1026
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:33,370
A legendary handsome knight,
fearless rescuer of princesses.

1027
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:38,580
Sitting in a tree,
not getting K - I - S - I - N - G - D.

1028
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:41,410
Burn. I can't spell.

1029
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,230
You don't have to do this.

1030
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:47,340
Just take the shoes and let us go.

1031
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,550
I wish. They're made of pure magic apple.

1032
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:53,690
The fruit of temptation and want.
They feed on your desires

1033
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:58,190
Once they give you what you desire,
the bond is permanent.

1034
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,650
That's not true. She took
them off in the river.

1035
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,400
That doesn't make any sense.

1036
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:07,070
How could she possibly want to save you
more than she wanted to be beautiful?

1037
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,400
What did you do to her?

1038
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:11,580
Did you cast a spell?

1039
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:15,260
What's going to happen to her?

1040
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:20,220
Well, once she eats the apple, its magic
will turn her into a magic apple tree.

1041
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:23,340
The first bell, nothing really happens,
but very dramatic.

1042
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:25,850
The tree bears fruit,
and the second bell...

1043
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:28,090
Oh! Excitement mounts!

1044
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:30,300
The morning sun touches the fruit

1045
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:33,030
turning it into a new
pair of red shoes

1046
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:36,020
And number three, the circle of life!

1047
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:37,390
And then what?

1048
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:41,020
Regina will be the most
beautiful person in the kingdom.

1049
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,330
Forever.

1050
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:45,230
I don't care about her,
what about Snow White?

1051
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:49,630
The tree withers and dies,
and so does Snow White.

1052
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:51,440
No!

1053
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:53,280
Yes!

1054
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:57,830
Oh, I'm rotten! I'm dying.

1055
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,560
Why don't you come back and play?

1056
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:25,270
Not so fast.

1057
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:36,160
It's gonna hurt.

1058
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:42,880
Oh yeah! Stretch it out.

1059
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:55,670
Uh-oh.

1060
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:01,140
Smoke! Smoke!

1061
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:03,320
We're here, bitch. Are you okay?

1062
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:04,810
Yeah.

1063
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,400
I never thought I'd say this,

1064
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:10,400
but I'm so glad to be chubby
and green again.

1065
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,400
Seven to one.
I like those odds.

1066
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:15,660
Let's go.

1067
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:19,620
We like those odds even better.

1068
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,210
Are you up to this, muchacho?

1069
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:27,750
You finally pulled out Excalibur.

1070
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:32,020
Oh, yes, yes. I did it.
That's exactly how it went down.

1071
01:17:32,050 --> 01:17:34,300
Here you go Merlin.
You're gonna need these.

1072
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:35,340
Thanks.

1073
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:43,350
Here comes the sun.

1074
01:17:43,810 --> 01:17:45,650
Now let's all get dwarfed.

1075
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:54,070
Ah, this is where your
fairy tale ends, trolls.

1076
01:17:58,700 --> 01:17:59,700
You missed.

1077
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:38,320
Au revoir, mirror!

1078
01:18:53,410 --> 01:18:54,670
Finally.

1079
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:06,060
It's a good day to break a curse.

1080
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:09,940
Eternal Beauty.

1081
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,160
I'm sorry

1082
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:26,040
Snow White.

1083
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:32,340
Ahhh!

1084
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:02,070
Extraordinary! No more carrots for me.

1085
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:09,420
Woah! We're back!

1086
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,500
Yippee!

1087
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:21,930
Papa?

1088
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:33,430
Snow White?

1089
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:36,820
Oh papa!

1090
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:37,940
Snow!

1091
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,200
Wait.

1092
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:45,620
Where's Merlin?

1093
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:47,400
I'm so sorry.

1094
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:51,830
He sacrificed himself to stop Regina.

1095
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:53,960
Merlin, no!

1096
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,550
Merlin!

1097
01:21:59,070 --> 01:22:00,690
I thought you were gone.

1098
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:05,820
You're the most beautiful
woman in the world.

1099
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:10,160
With my eyes open

1100
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:13,370
or closed.

1101
01:22:24,670 --> 01:22:25,670
No.

1102
01:22:43,070 --> 01:22:44,900
I got Merlined.

1103
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:11,720
You're a prince, Merlin.

1104
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:21,980
Yeah, that Merlin.

1105
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,400
The one who's not really your type.

1106
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,740
I kind of liked the short
and green Merlin.

1107
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,710
But I'm still that Merlin inside.

1108
01:23:37,790 --> 01:23:40,410
Yes, yes you are.

1109
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:00,600
Any idea who that girl is?

1110
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,600
¶ I'm feeling good today

1111
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:18,300
¶ Aint nothing standing in my way

1112
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:20,500
¶ I wouldn't change a thing

1113
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:24,000
¶ I must get hot walking in a dream

1114
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,500
¶ Everybody wants to stop and stare

1115
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:30,500
¶ People talk but I don't care

1116
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:34,000
¶ Everybody wants to stop and stare

1117
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
¶ People talk but I don't care

1118
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
¶ Don't matter what you think or see

1119
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:43,010
¶ There's no-one I would rather be

1120
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:46,010
¶ Take me as I am this is me

1121
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:49,010
¶ There's no-one I would rather be

1122
01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:51,810
¶ It don't matter

1123
01:24:52,810 --> 01:24:55,010
¶ It don't matter to me

1124
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:57,710
¶ It don't matter

1125
01:24:57,710 --> 01:25:00,710
¶ Take me as I am this is me

1126
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:02,710
¶ I learned to let it go

1127
01:25:03,810 --> 01:25:05,610
¶ 'Cause I'm comfortable

1128
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:08,410
¶ In my own skin

1129
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,920
¶ I learned to dance in the suits I'm in

1130
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:15,420
¶ Everybody wants to stop and stare

1131
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:18,420
¶ People talk but I don't care

1132
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:21,620
¶ Everybody wants to stop and stare

1133
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:24,620
¶ People talk but I don't care

1134
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:27,620
¶ Don't matter what you think or see

1135
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:30,620
¶ There's no-one I would rather be

1136
