I used to think this was
the beginning of your story.

3
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:46,689
Memory is a strange thing.

4
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,689
It does not work like I thought it did.

5
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,689
We are so bound by time.

6
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,689
By its order.

7
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:27,689
It's okay. Come back to me.

8
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,689
Come back to me.

9
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:31,689
Come back to me.

10
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:33,689
Stick em up!

11
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:37,689
You are the sheriff in this here town?

12
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:41,689
My tickle guns are gonna get you!

13
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:46,689
You want me to chase you? You better run.

14
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:08,689
I remember moments in the middle.

15
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:13,689
I love you.

16
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:15,689
I hate you!

17
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:29,689
And this was the end.

18
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:39,689
Come back to me.

19
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:42,689
Baby, come back to me.

20
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:01,689
And now Im not so sure I believe in
beginnings and endings.

21
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:06,689
There are days that define
your story beyond your life.

22
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,689
Like the day they arrived.

23
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:23,689
Good Morning.

24
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:29,689
Where is everyone?

25
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,689
Ok... Well let's get started.

26
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:36,689
Today, we're talking about Portuguese

27
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:40,689
and why it sounds so different
from the other Romance languages.

28
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:45,689
The story of Portuguese begins
in the Kingdom of Galicia...

29
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:49,689
In the Middle Ages...

30
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:54,689
when a language was seen
as an expression of art.

31
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:03,689
Any news you want to share?

32
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:07,689
Dr. Banks can turn you turn the TV to
the news channel?

33
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:27,689
... But police have already
set up a perimeter around the area

34
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:29,689
<i>As you can see, we got just
about as close as we can...</i>

35
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:34,689
<i>but unfortunately, Montana right now,
is on complete lock down.</i>

36
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:37,689
<i>The object apparently touched down...</i>

37
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:40,689
<i>40 minutes ago,
just north of ****** 04.</i>

38
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:44,689
<i>We are waiting to hear if this is perhaps
an experimental vessel or...</i>

<i>Hold on...</i>

40
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:50,689
<i>Im learning that more objects like this</i>

41
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:55,689
<i>Have landed in as many as eight other
locations around the world</i>

<i>Yes? Henry?</i>

43
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:00,689
<i>This is from a site in Hokkaido.</i>

44
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:04,689
<i>This is worldwide and is
happening right now.</i>

45
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:11,689
Okay...um...

46
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:15,689
Class is dismissed.

47

<i>The Pentagon is simply asking
for cooperation</i>

48
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:08,689
<i>while authorities assess the object.</i>

49
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:09,689
<i>You are saying its not ours?</i>

50
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:13,689
<i>- Do you even know if its from Earth?
- We are collecting information.</i>

51
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:14,689
<i>We're coordinating with other countries.</i>

52
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:18,689
<i>We are not the only ones to
have one of these in our backyard.</i>

53
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,689
<i>If this is some kind of
peaceful first contact,</i>

54
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:25,689
<i>why send twelve? Why not just one?</i>

55
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:50,689
I do not know, Mom.

56
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:52,689
Im watching the same news you are.

57
00:07:56,689 --> 00:08:00,689
Mom...mom, please don't bother
with that channel.

58
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,689
How many times I have to say that
those people are idiots?

59
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:08,689
Do I sound nervous?

60
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,689
Ok, exactly...so...

61
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:16,689
Yeah, me? You know me. Im about the same

62
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:22,689
Mom, I'm fine.

63
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:26,689
Ok, I'll call you later - bye.

64
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,690
<i>And in around eight hours after landing,</i>

65
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,690
<i>Theres still no signs of what
might be called "first contact."</i>

66
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,690
<i>The objects measuring
at least 1500ft tall...</i>

67
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,690
<i>...Two more have reported to
have penetrated Russian airspace.</i>

on the coast of the Black Sea...</i>

69
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,690
<i>...above the ocean. So far there are 12
unidentified objects spread across the globe...</i>

70
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,690
<i>...there is no obvious logic
to their locations</i>

71

74
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:13,690

I'm Colonel G.T. Weber.

91
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,690
We havn't formally met,
but two years ago,

92
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,690
You did a Farsi translation
for the Intellengy?

93
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,690
And you made quick work
with those insurgents.

94
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,690
You're on top...

95
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,690
on everyone's list
when it comes to translations.

96
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,690
And yet youve been two years in the SSBI.

97
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,690
So, you still have top secret clearance.

98
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,690
So thats why I'm in your office
and not in Berkeley.

99
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,690
Okay?

100
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,690
I have something I need you
to translate for me.

101
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,690
<i>Why are you here?</i>

102
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,690
<i>Can you understand us?</i>

103
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,690
<i>Where did you come from?</i>

104
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,690
Now you heard...
what you make of it?

105
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,690
- Is that...?
- Yes.

106
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,690
- How many?
- How many what?

107
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,690
How many were speaking?

108
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,690
Two.

109
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,690
They were speaking at the same time.

110
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,690
Are you sure they had mouths...

111
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,690
How would you approach translating this?

112
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,690
You hear any words? Phrases?

113
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,690
I do not... I do not know.

114
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,690
So what can you tell?

115
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,690
I can tell you that it is impossible to
translate an audio file.

116
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,690
I would need to be there
to interact with them.

117
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,690
You did not need that for Farsi translation.

118
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,690
I did not need because I already
knew the language, but this is...

119
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,690
I know what you're doing.

120
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,690
- Tell me what Im doing.
- I'll not take you to Montana.

121
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:33,690
Its all I can do to keep it turning into a tourist
site for everybody who has a clearance.

122
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,690
Im just telling you what it would take
to do this job.

123
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,690
It is not a negotiation.

124
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,690
If I leave here... your chance is gone.

125
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,690
Good day.

Colonel...

127
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,690
You mentioned Berkeley.
Are you going to ask Danvers next?

128
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,690
Maybe.

129
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,690
Before you commit to him...

130
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,690
ask him the Sanskrit word for "war"
and its translation.

He says that means discussion.

- A desire for more cows.

Pack your bags.

139
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,690

- Take only 10!

141
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,690
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

142
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,690
Thanks.

143
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,690

Yeah.

- Its wrong?
- The cornerstone of civilization

00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,690
Beyond that, how did they get here?

160
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,690
Are they capable of faster
than light travel?

161
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,690
I made a list of questions ranging from
handshakes to binary sequences...

162
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:19,690
How about we just talk to them

163
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,690
before we start throwing problem at them?

164
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,690
That's why you both are here.

165
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,690
I'll bring the coffee.

166
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,690
Coffee with some aliens.

167
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,690
- Take them to Dr. Kettler.
- Yes sir.

168
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,690
The procedure takes just a few minutes,
then we'll start.

169
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,690
Alright.

170
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,690
They will take care of your bags...

171
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,690
and cell phones.

172
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,690
Follow me.

173
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,690
Put this on and wear them all times.

174
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,690
Sir, they're here.

175
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,690
Louise Banks, Ian Donnelly.

176
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,690
When was your last meal?

177
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,690
- Last night.
- Same.

178
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,690
When was the last time
you did something stressful?

179
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,690
Does now count?

180
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,690
- Just saying.
- Who's being...

181
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,690
Carted off in a med-bag?

182
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,690
Not everyone is able to process
experiences like this.

183
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,690
Im gonna take some bllod from you.

184
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,690
and give you an immunization doze to

185
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,690
cover you against bacterial threats.
Can you sign this please?

186
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,690
Before we can start.

187
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,690
- Are any of you claustrophobic?
- No.

188
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,690
Are taking any medication, any allergies?

189
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,690
pregnant?

190
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,690
The boost doze may give
a kick to your systems,

191
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,690
so you may experience side effects:

192
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,690
like nausea, dizziness, headaches.

193
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,690
Or even a ringing in your ears.

194
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,690
<i>In exactly 112 minutes and 19 seconds</i>

195
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,690
<i>gravity starts to shift
and fall out of the room.</i>

196
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,690
Have you found a scientific explanation
for it?

197
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,690
- Like is it for them?
- No, I think it is for us.

198
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,690
<i>There seems to circulate air inside
the chamber, so...</i>

199
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,690
<i>After two hours, you run out of oxygen.</i>

200
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,690
It doesn't take you 18 hours to pump
fresh air into a room?

201
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,690
Atmosphere.

202
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,690
- Excuse me?
- If their atmosphere

203
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:06,690
is different from earth,

204
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,690
It would take hours to balance
the concentration of air

205
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,690
and the pressure everytime
we open their door.

206
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,690
Are you saying that could suffocate us
if they wanted to?

207
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,690
This is Agent David Halpern, the CIA.

208
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,690
- Let me take you to your stations.
- Yes sir.

209
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,690
We need the answers as soon as possible.

210
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,690
What they want, where they came from.

211
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,690
Why you are here, this is the priority.

212
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,690
Everyone.

213
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,690
This is Dr. Ian Donnelly,
he will lead the team.

214
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,690
Have they responded to anything?
Shapes, patterns,

215
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,690
numbers, Fibonacci?

216
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,690
We can't tell what they were saying,
but they responded to "hello", so...

217
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,690
Ok that is all.

218
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,690
What have you figured out?

219
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,690
We're just getting started.
Good Morning.

220
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,690
This is Dr Louise Banks.

221
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:54,690
- She will be heading your team.
- Dr. Banks, its a pleasure

222
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,690
Dr. Banks is taking over the mission
from Dr. Waller.

223
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,690
The 15 minute alarm.

224
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,690
What kind of radiation are we walking into?

225
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,690
No, this is just for safety.

226
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,690
So is there any physical contact...

227
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,690
with them?
I'm the only one using the word: aliens?

228
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,690
It has a wall made of glass,
we do not make contact.

229
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,690
What they look like?

230
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,690
You'll see soon enough. Hurry up.

231
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,690
The suits are clumsy at first.

232
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,690
But you'll get used to them.

233
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,690
All personnel in the second vehicle.

234
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,690
We get there in a few minutes.

235
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,690
Make sure you hold onto something.

236
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:17,690
Every 18 hours... the door
opens at the bottom.

237
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,690
Thats when we go in.

238
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,690
Yeah, that has happened.

239
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,690
Alright, lets move. Time is wasting.

240
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,690
You ready?

241
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,690
You ready?

242
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,690
It's okay, sir.

243
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,690
- you can proceed.
- stand by

244
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,690
Okay, bring it up.

245
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,690
You okay?

246
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,690
Yeah.

247
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,690
Dr. Banks.

248
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,690
You can do it. C'mon.

249
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,690
I... I think...

250
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,690
Grab her.

251
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,690
Dr. Donnelly, you cool?

252
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:48,690
yeah!

253
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,690
Holy fuck!

254
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,690
We go down in there,

255
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,690
You can start your job.

256
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,690
- ok.
- ok.

257
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,690
- Everybody, move up.
- Alpha Team in position.

258
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,690
We're on the move.

259
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,690
Setting up equipment...

260
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,690
What happens now?

261
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,690
They'll arrive.

262
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,690
Dr. Banks?

263
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,690
Dr. Banks?

264
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,690
You can start.

265
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,690
Wait... Just a minute.

266
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,690
I'm fired?

267
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,690
You were better than the last guy.

268
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,690
That does not make me feel any better.

269
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,690
You have till 0200 hours
to think something up.

270
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,690
And what happens then?

271
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,690
You go back in.

272
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:33,690
Violence continues to spread across the US
today due to 2 bombings.

273
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:37,690
The President has declared
a mandatory dusk to dawn curfew

274
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,690
after the crack down by the National Guard

275
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:42,690
Failed to prevent a third night
of looting across the country.

276
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:46,690
In North Dakota, 144 members of
the St. Lawrence Pentecostal occult

277
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,690
Are feared dead after they
set their compound ablaze.

278
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,690
Their website claims, the arrival of aliens

279
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,690
Set in motion a prophecy that 12...

280
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,690
Uh.. we're up in 15...
You got any new intel?

281
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,690
Yeah. We've been playing back
some of their sounds...

282
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:22,690
And where has that got you?

283
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:26,690
When they play audio back at us.
Its from an unseen source

284
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,690
What are you up with?

285
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:32,690
Conversations from inside the
room. Branches of dialogue.

286
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,690
We have nothing.

287
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:13,690
- Whats that for?
- Visual aid.

288
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:17,690
Look, I'm never going to
be able to speak their words,

289
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:18,690
if they aren't talking.

290
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,690
But they might have some sort of
written language

291
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,690
or basis for visual communication.

292
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,690
Ok. Let's start.

293
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,690
Human.

294
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,690
Human.

295
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,690
I'm human.

296
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,690
And you?

297
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,690
Human.

298
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,690
- Oh my God.
- Are you recording this?

299
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,690
Yes sir. I have sent this to base.

300
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,690
Louise, its incredible!

301
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,690
Human.

302
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,690
Human.

303
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,690
Human.

304
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:03,690
Okay... Slow down Louise.

305
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,690
I don't want to take away from your success,

306
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:28,690
but Dr. Banks,
is it really the right approach?

307
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,690
Try to teach them
how to speak and read?

308
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,690
- Thats gonna take long.
- You're wrong!

309
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,690
Its faster.

310
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:39,690
Everything you do here,

311
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:42,690
I have to explain to a
room full of men,

312
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,690
whose first and last question

313
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,690
Is how can this be used against us.

314
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,690
So you'll have to give me more than that!

315
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,690
Kangaroo.

316
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,690
What is that?

317
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,690
In 1770,

318
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,690
Captain James Cook's ship ran aground

319
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,690
off the coast of Australia and led a party,

320
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,690
where they found the aboriginal people.

321
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,690
One of the sailors pointed to the animals

322
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,690
that hop around and
put their babies in their pouch,

323
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:11,690
And he asked what they were.
The Aborigines said "kangaroo".

324
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,690
And your point is?

325
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,690
It wasn't until later that they learned
that "kangaroo" means

326
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,690
"I don't understand". So...

327
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,690
I need this so that
we don't misinterpret things in there,

328
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:26,690
otherwise it is going to take 10 times
as long.

329
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,690
I can sell that for now.

330
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,690
But I need you to submit
your vocabulary of words

331
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:34,690
before the next session.

332
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,690
Remember what happened to the Aborigines.

333
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:41,690
A more advanced race,
nearly wiped them out.

334
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,690
- Its a good story.
- Thanks.

335
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:56,690
Its not true, but it proves my point.

336
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,690
HUMAN?

337
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:18,690
I think we can present some
prime numbers here.

338
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:22,690
- It's something.
- Congratulations, you're a parrot.

339
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,690
Its a lot more than that,
you cheeky bastard. Dont you see?

340
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:28,690
They can't seem to follow our algebra.

341
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,690
But complex behaviours - that clears.

342
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:38,690
That does not make any sense, does it?

343
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,690
Problem is, not everyone shares

344
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,690
our policy of being open with the aliens.

345
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,690
That is Gen. Shang.

346
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,690
It is gathering strength in Shanghai

347
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:54,690
and at least four other nations
would follow him.

348
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,690
- Louise, we need get ground today.
- ok.

349
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:09,690
You're gonna teach them your name
and Ian's?

350
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:12,690
Yes, so that we can learn their names,
if they have names,

351
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,690
and then introduce pronouns later.

352
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,690
These are grade school words.

353
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:19,690
Eating, walking.

354
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,690
Help me understand.

355
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:30,690
No no no! Not the top!

356
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,690
Ok, this is where you want to get to, right?

357
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,690
- That is the question.
- Right.

358
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:43,690
So, first we need to make sure that
they understand what a question is.

359
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:48,690
The nature of our request for information

360
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:49,690
on the response.

361
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:52,690
Then we need to clarify

362
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:55,690
the difference between a specific "you"...

363
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,690
and a collective "you".

364
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:01,690
We don't want to know why
a 'Joe' alien is here,

365
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:04,690
we want to know why they all landed.

366
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:08,690
A purpose requires an understanding
of intent.

367
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,690
We need to find out do they make
conscious choices,

368
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:13,690
or is the motivation so instinctive

369
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,690
that they don't understand
any why "?"question at all.

370
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:20,690
And biggest of all we need to have
enough vocabulary with them,

371
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:22,690
that we understand their answer.

372
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:25,690
Yeah.

373
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,690
Stick to your list.

374
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,690
Just...

375
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:33,690
Don't add anything to it.

376
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,690
Let's get started.

377
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,690
Louise.

378
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,690
Louise, I'm Louise.

379
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,690
What is that?

380
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:25,690
Is that a new symbol?
I can't tell.

381
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:28,690
I don't know,
I think its the symbol for "human" again.

382
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:30,690
But with a curl at the end.

383
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:33,690
Maybe they indicate a question.
I don't know.

384
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:37,690
I do not know, Louise,
I think they are confused.

385
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:41,690
Dr. Banks, move to the next word.

386
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,690
Dr. Banks!

387
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:05,690
- Its okay.
- Whats going on?

388
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:06,690
What are you doing?

389
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:09,690
- Im fine.
- Are you crazy?

390
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:11,690
They need to see me.

391
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:13,690
She's taking off protection.
Dr. Banks!

392
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,690
Are you ok?
You are at risk of contamination.

393
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:21,690
- They need to see me.
- Dr. Banks.

394
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:25,690
- Dr. Banks.
- She's going upto the screen.

395
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,690
Should we abort?

396
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:34,690
Go back to your stations.

397
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:51,690
Now that's a proper introduction.

398
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,690
Louise.

399
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,690
I'm Louise.

400
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:13,690
Ian, you want to introduce yourself?

401
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:18,690
I...

402
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:22,690
Louise.

403
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:28,690
Fuck you.

404
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:34,690
Everyone dies one day, right?

405
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,690
Sir, Donnelly is taking off his suit too.

406
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,690
Permission to abort?

407
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:43,690
Continue with the session.

408
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:01,690
Ian.

409
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:03,690
Louise.

410
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:05,690
You?

411
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,690
Who are you?

412
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:38,690
I think those are their names.

413
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:43,690
They have names.

414
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:45,690
So what are we gonna call them?

415
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:47,690
I do not know.

416
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:51,690
I was thinking of Abbott and Costello.

417
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:55,690
Yeah.

418
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:57,690
I like it.

419
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:01,690
I like it.

420
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:20,690
Vehicle One, exit your vehicles
and proceed to the decontamination camp.

421
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:31,690
Do not take off the masks until they enter.

422
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:16,690
Do not remove their masks,

423
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:19,690
and adhere to the decontamination room.

424
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:26,690
- How do you feel?
- Overworked.

425
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:30,690
Like I said, I need to tell you,
you put yourself at risk.

426
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:34,690
There is no signs of radiation poisoning...
yet.

427
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:37,690
I'll check your blood.

428
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:39,690
- For now, Im gonna give you another boost.
- ok.

429
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:45,690
- No radiation?
- Nothing else we can detect either.

430
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:47,690
But I will still give her a strong
cocktail, regardless.

431
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:49,690
It was the first time we made
significant progress.

432
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:54,690
Alright. We'll take the risk.

433
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:58,690
- Honey...honey.
- What's going on?

434
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:01,690
- Can you tell me something?
- No.

435
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:05,690
- You are worried.
- How can I not worry?

436
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:07,690
Calm down.

437
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:11,690
Becky asked if the monsters
are going to kill Dad.

438
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:13,690
Honey, its not gonna happen.

439
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:19,690
- Come soon, please.
- No need to worry.

440
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:21,690
I'm so scared.

441
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,690
Here are some of the many things

442
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:39,690
we don't know about the heptopodes.

443
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:42,690
Greek: Hepta seven. Pod foot.

444
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:45,690
Seven feet. Heptaกpode.

445
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:48,690
Who are they?

446
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:53,690
Trying to answer this in any meaningful
way is hampered by the fact that,

447
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:56,690
outside of being able to see them
and hear them,

448
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:59,690
They have deposited absolutely no footprint.

449
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:04,690
The chemical composition of their
spaceship is unknown.

450
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:08,690
The Shell emits no waste,
no gas, no radiation.

451
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:11,690
Assuming that the ships
communicate with each other,

452
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,690
they do so without detection.

453
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,690
The air between the shells is controlled

454
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:18,690
by sonic emissions or light waves.

455
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:23,690
They are scientists or tourists?

456
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:26,690
If scientists,
they don't seem to ask a lot of questions.

457
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:31,690
Why they land in these places?

458
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:35,690
The world's most decorated experts
can not figure that out.

459
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:38,690
The most plausible theory is that
they chose places on earth

460
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:41,690
With the lowest incidences of
lightning strikes.

461
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:43,690
But there are exceptions.

462
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:46,690
The second most plausible theory
is that Sheena Easton

463
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,690
Had a hit song in each of
these sites in 1980.

464
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:50,690
So... we just don't know.

465
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:54,690
How do they communicate?

466
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,690
Here, Louise has brought us all to shame.

467
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:02,690
The first breakthrough was discovering
that there is no co-relation

468
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:06,690
between what a heptaกpode says,
and what a heptaกpode writes.

469
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:15,690
IAN YOU

470
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:24,690
Unlike all human written language,

471
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:26,690
their writing is semasiogrรกfica.

472
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:30,690
It conveyes meaning,
it does not represent sound.

473
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:39,690
Perhaps they view our form of writing
as a wasted oppurtunity,

474
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:42,690
Passing every second
communication's channel.

475
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:49,690
We have our friends in Pakistan to thank

476
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:52,690
For their study on how the
heptaกpodes write.

477
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,690
Because unlike speech,

478
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:57,690
a hologram is free of time.

479
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:02,690
Like their ship
or their bodies.

480
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:06,690
their written language has no form
or no direction.

481
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:09,690
Linguists call this nonlinear orthography.

482
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:13,690
Which raises the question:
"Is this how they think?"

483
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:17,690
Imagine you wanted to write a sentence

484
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,690
using 2 hands, starting from either side.

485
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:23,690
You have to know each word
you wanted to use,

486
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:26,690
as well as how much space they will occupy.

487
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:30,690
A heptaกpode can write a complex sentence

488
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:32,690
in two seconds effortlessly.

489
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:35,690
It took us a month to make
the simplest vocabulary.

490
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:39,690
Next, explain the vocabulary.

491
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:42,690
Louise thinks it will easily take
another month to get ready for that.

492
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,690
Hey.

493
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:05,690
- Hi.
- Weber's looking for you.

494
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,690
Why do you think I'm hiding out here?

495
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:11,690
C'mon up.

496
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:22,690
- Nice out here, huh?
- Yeah, it's a nice view.

497
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:25,690
Away from the noise.

498
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:30,690
You know, I was just thinking about you.

499
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:36,690
You approach language like a
mathematician. You know that right?

500
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:41,690
I will take that as a compliment.

501
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,690
But it is.

502
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:46,690
And... I want you to

503
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,690
Steer us around these communication traps

504
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:51,690
that I did not even know existed.

505
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:52,690
What...?

506
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:56,690
I guess this is why I'm still single.

507
00:56:56,690 --> 00:57:00,690
Trust me, you can understand communication

508
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:01,690
and still end up single.

509
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:13,690
I feel like everything
that happens there...

510
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:16,690
It comes down to the 2 of us.

511
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:22,690
It's a good thing, alright? You and I?

512
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:28,690
See those jokers that
we are working with?

513
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:31,690
Thank God, I got you.

514
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:37,690
<b>ALIEN CRISIS
 DAY 25 VENEZUELA</b>

515
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:41,690
<b>UNITED KINGDOM SAVE OUR SPECIES!</b>

516
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:45,690
Tonight, the first photo of the aliens
goes viral.

517
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:49,690
Biological contamination is a
major risk factor

518
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:52,690
At the Montana site. So say environmental
pressure groups.

519
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:54,690
800,000 march on Washington

520
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:57,690
to protest the government's handling
on the crisis.

521
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:00,690
All this and more, special coverage.

522
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:04,690
First contact was inside that thing.

523
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,690
Who's in charge? The government, of course.

524
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:11,690
The same government who ruined our
backyard and bankrupted our military.

525
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:14,690
Look at these people.
Most of them don't even have guns.

526
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:16,690
We could be facing a full scale
invasion invasion.

527
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:20,690
Our President is willing to sit back,
and let them overtake the country.

528
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:23,690
We are falling asleep at the wheel, people!

529
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:25,690
You know what Im talking about!

530
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:29,690
The smartest thing to do right now,
would be a show of force.

531
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:31,690
I'm talking about a shot across the brow.

532
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:35,690
I want to know what you think
about all this.

533
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:03,690
whats this word?

534
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:22,690
Green Planet...

535
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:30,690
The Earth is a planet.

536
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:33,690
Want to see my project
for Miss. Garrett's class?

537
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:35,690
Of course, little nose.

538
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:40,690
We had to make up our own TV show.

539
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:43,690
If we had one.

540
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:46,690
- Who are those two people?
- Thats you and Dad.

541
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:48,690
The show is called: "Mommy and Daddy
talk to animals."

542
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:53,690
Its lovely.

543
00:59:58,690 --> 00:59:59,690
Ok.

544
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:07,690
- It's okay to be sad that your dad and I...
- I know. I'm not.

545
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:11,690
We both love you very much.

546
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:14,690
I know. It's just a drawing - not real.

547
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:15,690
Louise?

548
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:21,690
Are you alright?

549
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:25,690
Yes I'm fine.

550
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:29,690
I not sure if it's something...

551
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:31,690
I can explain.

552
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:33,690
Would you like a checkup
with Dr. Kevin?

553
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:36,690
I am ok.

554
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:39,690
It's fine, I'm ok.

555
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:43,690
How are you feeling?

556
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:49,690
I need some sleep, but...

557
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:51,690
I am fine.

558
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:54,690
Yeah?

559
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:58,690
I've been doing a bit of reading
about this idea that...

560
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:03,690
What if you emmerse yourself into
a foreign language...

561
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:07,690
- You can actually rewire your brain.
- It is a hypothesis.

562
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:09,690
It is a theory that...

563
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:12,690
It is the theory that...

564
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:16,690
The language you speak
determines how you think.

565
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:19,690
Yes, it affects how you see everything...

566
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:24,690
I'm curious. Are you dreaming
in their language?

567
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:36,690
I've had some dreams.

568
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:41,690
I don't think that makes me
unfit to do this job.

569
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:04,690
- Did you sleep?
- A little.

570
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:07,690
Know Mandarin?

571
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:23,690
The voice you're about to hear
belongs to the Chinese military chief.

572
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:26,690
General Shang.

573
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:29,690
Put it on.

574
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:35,690
We also have a live feed,
if you want to look.

575
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:37,690
Rewind.

576
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:40,690
Stop.

577
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:44,690
He is saying each of the 12
is offering advanced technology.

578
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:51,690
Go back again... play.

579
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:58,690
The scientific team is attempting
to decode the sense...

580
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:01,690
"sense"?
I dont know what that means.

581
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:04,690
Something that will manage.

582
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:08,690
Suits, honor and flowers. I don't...

583
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:13,690
- I don't know, that's all.
- I don't know what it means either.

584
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:16,690
An hour ago, China mobilized forces...

585
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:18,690
and now Russia is following suit.

586
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:20,690
Shang is about to start something.

587
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:23,690
All same suits... Suits...

588
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:28,690
suits, honor, flowers...

589
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:30,690
Colonel, those are all parts of Mahjong.

590
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:34,690
God... are they...?

591
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:37,690
They are using a game to communicate
with the Heptapodes?

592
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:41,690
Maybe... why?

593
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:45,690
Lets say I taught them
chess instead of English.

594
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:49,690
Every conversation would be a game,
every idea expressed through opposition.

595
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:51,690
Victory... defeat. You see the problem?

596
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:55,690
If all I ever gave you was a hammer...

597
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:57,690
Everythings a nail.

598
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:01,690
We need to ask the big question.

599
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,690
Ready or not.

600
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:52,690
Heptaกpodes purpose.

601
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:06,690
Purpose of heptaกpode.
Earth. What is your purpose?

602
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:15,690
Do we only have Costello?

603
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:21,690
Ok. There you are.

604
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:46,690
What is he saying?

605
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:55,690
Offer weapon.

606
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:04,690
You saw what they wrote. Using a word that
they don't fully understand.

607
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:06,690
Enough!

608
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:08,690
Louise.

609
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:10,690
We don't know if they understand

610
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:13,690
the difference between a weapon and a tool.

611
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:17,690
Our language like a culture is messy,
and sometimes one can be both.

612
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:20,690
I think it's quite possible that they are
asking us or them for something.

613
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:22,690
Not the other way round.

614
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:24,690
Like the first part of trade.

615
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:27,690
So how do we clarify their intentions
beyond these two words?

616
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:31,690
I go back in.. right
away we go back in... we clear this out..

617
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:34,690
- It's more complicated than that.
- How is it more complicated than that?

618
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:38,690
Col., the Secretary of Defense
is on the line for you.

619
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:49,690
We need to sit on this information
till we know what it means.

620
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:51,690
So we aren't sharing it with our enemies.
We have to consider the idea

621
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:55,690
that our visitors are prodding us
to fight among ourselves,

622
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:57,690
till only one faction prevails.

623
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:59,690
- There is no evidence for that.
- Sure there is.

624
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:01,690
Just grab a history book.

625
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:04,690
British in India, Germans with Rwanda.

626
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:07,690
They even got a name for it in Hungary.

627
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:17,689
We are a world with no single leader.

628
01:08:17,689 --> 01:08:20,689
Its impossible to deal with just one of us.

629
01:08:20,689 --> 01:08:22,689
We have the word weapon now...

630
01:08:22,689 --> 01:08:24,689
Yes general.

631
01:08:49,689 --> 01:08:50,689
What did they say?

632
01:08:51,689 --> 01:08:54,689
China and Russia are off the grid.
They aren't speaking very well.

633
01:08:54,689 --> 01:08:57,689
What they learnt in the last session
has them spooked.

634
01:09:00,689 --> 01:09:01,689
Yes sir.

635
01:09:01,689 --> 01:09:03,689
We have orders to do the same.

636
01:09:03,689 --> 01:09:06,689
- Wait these are our allies!
- Put your radio on silence!

637
01:09:06,689 --> 01:09:09,689
- Do it.
- We received a message from the heptaก...

638
01:09:10,689 --> 01:09:12,689
Damn it!

639
01:09:12,689 --> 01:09:16,689
We need to be talking to each other!
Find out what this means.

640
01:09:24,689 --> 01:09:27,689
This cam is now offline...

641
01:09:31,689 --> 01:09:34,689
We've never re-entered the session before.

642
01:09:34,689 --> 01:09:36,689
Louise, trust me ok? We got time.

643
01:09:36,689 --> 01:09:38,689
Just gotta step on it, alright?

644
01:09:39,689 --> 01:09:41,689
<b>"USE WEAPON"</b>

645
01:09:41,689 --> 01:09:44,689
This is the alien message sent to provoke

646
01:09:44,689 --> 01:09:48,689
the Chinese government to withdraw their
scientists from the international mission today.

647
01:09:48,689 --> 01:09:51,689
In a statement, General Shang said:

648
01:09:51,689 --> 01:09:53,689
"China no longer trusts the aliens

649
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:54,689
who wants to divide us.

650
01:09:54,689 --> 01:09:56,689
Humanity must be protected. "

651
01:09:56,689 --> 01:09:58,689
China has asked for immediate
talks at the UN.

652
01:10:03,689 --> 01:10:06,689
Alpha 1-9, this is Condor. Over.

653
01:10:10,689 --> 01:10:14,689
Alpha 1-9, this is Condor. Come in. Over.

654
01:10:19,689 --> 01:10:22,689
Captain Marks, Condor,
not receiving a transmission.

655
01:10:22,689 --> 01:10:24,689
Let me know if you are listening.

656
01:10:25,689 --> 01:10:30,689
Capt. Marks, all escorts are
ordered to cease all activites...

657
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:02,689
No, no, no...
Dr. Banks you can't go in there.

658
01:11:02,689 --> 01:11:04,689
- Just need to ask one question.
- Dr. Banks!

659
01:11:05,689 --> 01:11:08,689
The session is closed.
You can't go back in, it's dangerous...

660
01:11:08,689 --> 01:11:10,689
We just need 5 minutes. No sweat.

661
01:11:10,689 --> 01:11:12,689
Morris, Let him go.

662
01:11:14,689 --> 01:11:16,689
Hey, Abbott.

663
01:11:21,689 --> 01:11:24,689
So, what are calling our session?
Session 37?

664
01:11:25,689 --> 01:11:29,689
- No 36 Part 2
- Ok.

665
01:11:35,689 --> 01:11:36,689
Why are you alone?

666
01:11:36,689 --> 01:11:38,689
Been attempting to call Capt. Marks.

667
01:11:38,689 --> 01:11:42,689
- The escorts not responding.
- Why not?

668
01:11:42,689 --> 01:11:44,689
Send security.

669
01:11:47,689 --> 01:11:50,689
Offer a weapon... question mark.

670
01:11:55,689 --> 01:11:57,689
They are offering us something.

671
01:12:07,689 --> 01:12:10,689
Technology, device, method...

672
01:12:10,689 --> 01:12:12,689
See this? This is a different word.

673
01:12:12,689 --> 01:12:15,689
This... this segment is a lot busier.

674
01:12:20,689 --> 01:12:23,689
Give... technology...

675
01:12:25,689 --> 01:12:26,689
... Now.

676
01:12:35,689 --> 01:12:36,689
Whats he doing?

677
01:12:42,689 --> 01:12:45,689
Capt. ****** check.

678
01:12:53,689 --> 01:12:55,689
security team coming, sir.

679
01:12:55,689 --> 01:12:58,689
4 minutes remain.
We must see this through.

680
01:12:58,689 --> 01:13:00,689
Come on. Download weapons.

681
01:13:00,689 --> 01:13:03,689
- Fire *******.
- Understood.

682
01:13:03,689 --> 01:13:05,689
We will open shooting soon.

683
01:13:05,689 --> 01:13:08,689
To be no casualties.

684
01:13:35,689 --> 01:13:37,689
Abbott wants me to write on the barrier.

685
01:13:45,689 --> 01:13:47,689
I don't know.

686
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,689
I can't do it with both hands.

687
01:15:16,689 --> 01:15:18,689
Louise.

688
01:15:34,689 --> 01:15:35,689
What is that?

689
01:16:20,689 --> 01:16:23,689
Hey...Hey...Hey... Take it easy.

690
01:16:23,689 --> 01:16:26,689
You suffered a concussion.
Just lay back.

691
01:16:29,689 --> 01:16:30,689
How you feeling?

692
01:16:39,689 --> 01:16:42,689
- How is Ian?
- Well, same as you. He is ok.

693
01:16:44,689 --> 01:16:46,689
- Who...

694
01:16:46,689 --> 01:16:48,689
- Who did this?
- Some soldiers.

695
01:16:48,689 --> 01:16:51,689
Been watching too much TV.

696
01:16:54,689 --> 01:16:57,689
- What is that?
- take it easy... take it easy

697
01:16:57,689 --> 01:17:01,689
The place is no longer secure.
We're on standby to evacuate.

698
01:17:01,689 --> 01:17:03,689
Where is Ian?

699
01:17:04,689 --> 01:17:06,689
Weber came and got him maybe
10 minutes ago.

700
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:09,689
He wouldn't leave till
he knew you were okay.

701
01:17:13,689 --> 01:17:17,689
The whole tent is on the clock to figure
out whatever it is you were given up there.

702
01:17:23,689 --> 01:17:24,689
This is all of it?

703
01:17:25,689 --> 01:17:27,689
The feed wasn't interrupted
by the explosion.

704
01:17:28,689 --> 01:17:30,689
Thats right.

705
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:35,689
- You see something?
- I don't know yet.

706
01:17:35,689 --> 01:17:38,689
I need my team get together
with Louise's team.

707
01:17:38,689 --> 01:17:41,689
- I need everyone working on this.
- We can not leave.

708
01:17:41,689 --> 01:17:43,689
- Glad to see you awake.
- We need to go back in there

709
01:17:43,689 --> 01:17:45,689
and explain to them that
this wasn't our fault.

710
01:17:45,689 --> 01:17:47,689
- We can't go back inside.
- We have to!

711
01:17:47,689 --> 01:17:49,689
What happened in there was an attack.

712
01:17:49,689 --> 01:17:52,689
We can hope for the best,
but we have to prepare for retaliation.

713
01:17:52,689 --> 01:17:54,689
we may have to evacuate...

714
01:17:54,689 --> 01:17:57,689
Thats a wrong move.
As long as they stay, we have to stay.

715
01:18:31,689 --> 01:18:33,689
Well, they are not leaving.

716
01:18:35,689 --> 01:18:37,689
Why does it feel worse?

717
01:18:42,689 --> 01:18:44,689
China is on the offensive.

718
01:18:44,689 --> 01:18:48,689
They are positioning their military to blow
the alien vessel right out of the sky.

719
01:18:48,689 --> 01:18:51,689
If this happens, we can't sit
and wait for their retaliation.

720
01:18:51,689 --> 01:18:53,689
So get prepared.

721
01:18:53,689 --> 01:18:56,689
The Air Force and Infantry are standing by.

722
01:18:56,689 --> 01:18:59,689
<b>BREAKING NEWS</b>

723
01:18:59,689 --> 01:19:02,689
Tonight, China becomes the first
world power

724
01:19:02,689 --> 01:19:05,689
To declare war against the aliens.

725
01:19:05,689 --> 01:19:08,689
Following the failure of the diplomatic
efforts of the United Nations,

726
01:19:08,689 --> 01:19:12,689
China confirmed that its language experts
tonight...

727
01:19:12,689 --> 01:19:15,689
delivered an ultimatum at the Shanghai site.

728
01:19:15,689 --> 01:19:16,689
In a televised statement,

729
01:19:16,689 --> 01:19:19,689
Gen. Shang, chairman of the
People's Liberation Army,

730
01:19:19,689 --> 01:19:23,689
Said the aliens have 24 hours to
leave Chinese territory,

731
01:19:23,689 --> 01:19:25,689
or face destruction.

732
01:19:25,689 --> 01:19:27,689
And he urged all other world leaders

733
01:19:27,689 --> 01:19:30,689
to unite with China and
take a similar stance.

734
01:19:31,689 --> 01:19:34,689
With a huge build up of forces
at their landing sites,

735
01:19:34,689 --> 01:19:36,689
Pakistan, Russia and Sudan

736
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:39,689
Are thought to be following China's lead.

737
01:19:55,689 --> 01:19:57,689
It can't be random.

738
01:20:12,689 --> 01:20:14,689
Its going to take us years.

739
01:20:19,689 --> 01:20:21,689
Whats this term here?

740
01:20:25,689 --> 01:20:26,689
Mum.

741
01:20:29,689 --> 01:20:31,689
- Mother?
- Hm?

742
01:20:31,689 --> 01:20:35,689
- sweetie?
- Whats this term for that thing...

743
01:20:35,689 --> 01:20:37,689
Like a technical term...

744
01:20:37,689 --> 01:20:40,689
When we make a deal and we
both get something out of it?

745
01:20:40,689 --> 01:20:43,689
- A compromise?
- No...

746
01:20:44,689 --> 01:20:46,689
Like it's competition,

747
01:20:46,689 --> 01:20:49,689
But both sides end up happy.

748
01:20:50,689 --> 01:20:52,689
And win-win?

749
01:20:52,689 --> 01:20:54,689
more sciency than that.

750
01:20:54,689 --> 01:20:57,689
If you want science, call your father.

751
01:21:11,689 --> 01:21:13,689
Thank you.

752
01:21:23,689 --> 01:21:25,689
Sorry.

753
01:21:25,689 --> 01:21:28,689
Its okay.

754
01:21:32,689 --> 01:21:34,689
What time is it?

755
01:21:35,689 --> 01:21:38,689
Its time to open the bottle
you've been hiding.

756
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:44,689
You cracked something, didn't you?

757
01:21:45,689 --> 01:21:47,689
Yeah. Come here.

758
01:21:47,689 --> 01:21:52,689
Take a look at this section.
It seems to be talking about time.

759
01:21:52,689 --> 01:21:55,689
You see the symbol of "time" -
everywhere.

760
01:21:55,689 --> 01:21:57,689
So what is this?

761
01:21:58,689 --> 01:22:01,689
A formula for faster than light travel?

762
01:22:01,689 --> 01:22:03,689
Who can tell?

763
01:22:04,689 --> 01:22:07,689
It has too many gaps.
Its not complete.

764
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:08,689
Then it dawned on me.

765
01:22:11,689 --> 01:22:13,689
Right here.

766
01:22:14,689 --> 01:22:16,689
Stop focussing on the "1"s.
Look at the "0"s.

767
01:22:16,689 --> 01:22:20,689
How much of it is data and
how much of it is negative space?

768
01:22:21,689 --> 01:22:23,689
So I measured it.

769
01:22:25,689 --> 01:22:28,689
0.0833 recurring.

770
01:22:33,689 --> 01:22:35,689
Perhaps you'd like to add
that as a fraction.

771
01:22:38,689 --> 01:22:40,689
1/12.

772
01:22:43,689 --> 01:22:47,689
What is saying right here, is that,
this is one of twelfth.

773
01:22:47,689 --> 01:22:51,689
- We are part of a larger hole.
- Or 1 of 12 contestants for the prize.

774
01:22:51,689 --> 01:22:53,689
- Why do we have to talk to him?
- We all working together here.

775
01:22:53,689 --> 01:22:58,689
We need to talk to the other sites, we need to
help them with what they got from the other
Heptaกpodes.

776
01:22:58,689 --> 01:23:00,689
In case you don't remember,
we're blacked out.

777
01:23:00,689 --> 01:23:03,689
China just threatened to destroy
their Shell. We are on our own.

778
01:23:03,689 --> 01:23:05,689
But it says that all the pieces fit in.

779
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:07,689
And I'm telling you that no one else cares.

780
01:23:08,689 --> 01:23:11,689
Two hours ago we pulled this audio off
a secured channel in Russia.

781
01:23:11,689 --> 01:23:14,689
Someone from their science team
was broadcasting live.

782
01:23:16,689 --> 01:23:19,689
In their final session,
the alien said:

783
01:23:19,689 --> 01:23:22,689
"There's no time. Many become one..."

784
01:23:23,689 --> 01:23:25,689
I feel we have all the given weapons.

785
01:23:25,689 --> 01:23:27,689
If anyone is receiving this...

786
01:23:28,689 --> 01:23:29,689
Please...

787
01:23:35,689 --> 01:23:36,689
Well, I mean...

788
01:23:37,689 --> 01:23:40,689
There are a lot of ways you can
interpret what he said.

789
01:23:40,689 --> 01:23:42,689
I don't need an interpreter to
know what this means.

790
01:23:42,689 --> 01:23:46,689
Russia just executed one of their own
experts to keep their secret.

791
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:48,689
"Many become one"
can be their way of saying

792
01:23:48,689 --> 01:23:50,689
Some only required.

793
01:23:50,689 --> 01:23:53,689
Why hand it out to us in pieces?
Why not give it all?

794
01:23:53,689 --> 01:23:56,689
What better way to force us
to work together for once?

795
01:23:57,689 --> 01:23:58,689
Even if I did believe you,

796
01:23:58,689 --> 01:24:02,689
How in the world are you going to get anyone
else to play along, and give out their data?

797
01:24:03,689 --> 01:24:05,689
- We offer ours in return.
- yeah?

798
01:24:07,689 --> 01:24:10,689
- What, trade?
- Its a non zero sum game.

799
01:24:13,689 --> 01:24:15,689
Non zero sum game.

800
01:24:16,689 --> 01:24:19,689
Thats it. Thanks.

801
01:24:27,689 --> 01:24:30,689
9 local completely isolated.

802
01:24:30,689 --> 01:24:34,689
Only way to reach them is to physically drive and
yell at the border guards which we are doing.

803
01:24:34,689 --> 01:24:35,689
But it won't be fast enough.

804
01:24:35,689 --> 01:24:38,689
There must be a way to get the message.

805
01:24:38,689 --> 01:24:41,689
To our allies, maybe. But at this stage,
it's little too late.

806
01:24:41,689 --> 01:24:44,689
What we need is to get all the
other nations online...

807
01:24:44,689 --> 01:24:48,689
before we start a war and theres
no way for us to reach them

808
01:24:48,689 --> 01:24:51,689
Wait. Hold on a second.
Louise.

809
01:24:52,689 --> 01:24:53,689
Its right above us.

810
01:24:54,689 --> 01:24:56,689
Thats problematic for us right now.

811
01:24:56,689 --> 01:24:59,689
The Pentagon is convinced
that our Shell will retaliate.

812
01:24:59,689 --> 01:25:02,689
I'd guess its orders say that we leave
within the hour.

813
01:25:03,689 --> 01:25:06,689
Look they are not our enemy.
They meant no act of aggression towards us.

814
01:25:06,689 --> 01:25:08,689
Maybe thats their way of being aggressive.

815
01:25:08,689 --> 01:25:11,689
- Its not the question.
- Then what is the question?

816
01:25:12,689 --> 01:25:16,689
How do we get you back in that room
thats half a mile straight up?

817
01:25:16,689 --> 01:25:18,689
I think our work here is done.

818
01:25:18,689 --> 01:25:21,689
Its in the hands of our superiors now.

819
01:25:41,689 --> 01:25:43,689
What the hell is she doing?

820
01:29:00,689 --> 01:29:02,689
Costello?

821
01:29:04,689 --> 01:29:06,689
Where is Abbott?

822
01:29:16,689 --> 01:29:19,689
"ABBOTT IS DEATH PROCESS"

823
01:29:35,689 --> 01:29:37,689
I'm sorry.

824
01:29:39,689 --> 01:29:41,689
We're sorry.

825
01:29:45,689 --> 01:29:47,689
I need you to...

826
01:29:48,689 --> 01:29:52,689
I need you to... to send a message...
to the other sites.

I don't...

836
01:31:07,689 --> 01:31:11,689
I don't understand. Who is this child?

837
01:31:17,689 --> 01:31:20,689
The program is called

- Dr. Banks!
- Louise!

842
01:32:48,689 --> 01:32:50,689
Are you alright?

843
01:32:53,689 --> 01:32:55,689
- You alright?
- Yeah.

844
01:32:55,689 --> 01:32:57,689
Come here.

845
01:32:57,689 --> 01:32:58,689
I tried to understand. But they...

846
01:32:58,689 --> 01:33:01,689
It doesn't matter now.
We have orders to evacuate.

847
01:33:01,689 --> 01:33:03,689
- Why?
- Russia and Sudan

848
01:33:03,689 --> 01:33:04,689
will follow suit.

849
01:33:07,689 --> 01:33:09,689
Ian... I do not understand why...?

850
01:33:09,689 --> 01:33:11,689
Help me, Mama.

851
01:33:11,689 --> 01:33:13,689
Louise...

852
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:15,689

Momma!

854
01:33:21,689 --> 01:33:23,689
Sorry, honey.

855
01:33:27,689 --> 01:33:29,689
What day is it, do you know baby?

856
01:33:29,689 --> 01:33:30,689
Sunday.

857
01:33:36,689 --> 01:33:38,689
Are you gonna leave me like Daddy did?

858
01:33:39,689 --> 01:33:42,689
Oh, Hannah, honey,
your daddy didn't leave you.

859
01:33:43,689 --> 01:33:45,689
You're gonna see him... this weekend.

860
01:33:46,689 --> 01:33:49,689
He never look me anymore.

861
01:33:57,689 --> 01:33:58,689
Its my fault.

862
01:34:01,689 --> 01:34:05,689
I told him something that
he wasn't ready to hear.

863
01:34:06,689 --> 01:34:08,689
What?

864
01:34:10,689 --> 01:34:11,689
Well...

865
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:14,689
Believe it or not...

866
01:34:14,689 --> 01:34:17,689
I know something thats going to happen.

867
01:34:19,689 --> 01:34:22,689
I can not explain how I know it,
I just do.

868
01:34:23,689 --> 01:34:26,689
And when I told your daddy, he
got really mad.

869
01:34:28,689 --> 01:34:31,689
He said I made the wrong choice.

870
01:34:33,689 --> 01:34:36,689
What? Whats going to happen?

871
01:34:39,689 --> 01:34:41,689
It has to do with a...

872
01:34:41,689 --> 01:34:43,689
A very rare disease.

873
01:34:46,689 --> 01:34:48,689
And its unstoppable.

874
01:34:50,689 --> 01:34:52,689
Kind of like you are.

875
01:34:53,689 --> 01:34:54,689
You're so amazing

876
01:34:55,689 --> 01:34:59,689
And your poetry and all the other amazing
things that you share with the world.

877
01:35:00,689 --> 01:35:04,689
- I'm unstoppable?
- Yeah.

878
01:35:21,689 --> 01:35:22,689
I got you...

879
01:35:24,689 --> 01:35:25,689
I got you.

880
01:35:26,689 --> 01:35:27,689
Louise.

881
01:35:29,689 --> 01:35:31,689
I just realized why my husband left me.

882
01:35:31,689 --> 01:35:33,689
My husband left me.

883
01:35:33,689 --> 01:35:35,689
You have been married?

884
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:37,689
Let's get out of here.

885
01:36:12,689 --> 01:36:14,689
- Mamma.
- Yeah?

886
01:36:14,689 --> 01:36:16,689
Why my name is Hannah?

887
01:36:22,689 --> 01:36:25,689
Your name is very special.

888
01:36:25,689 --> 01:36:27,689
Because it is a palindrome.

889
01:36:27,689 --> 01:36:31,689
It reads the same word from backwards.

890
01:36:33,689 --> 01:36:37,689
- Turn it off.
- That goes back.

01:37:09,689 --> 01:37:11,689
We're done here.

TRANSLATING HEPTAPODES

898
01:37:38,689 --> 01:37:39,689
I can read it.

899
01:37:43,689 --> 01:37:45,689
- I know what it is.
- What?

900
01:37:45,689 --> 01:37:48,689
It's not a weapon. It's a gift.

901
01:37:48,689 --> 01:37:50,689
The weapon is their language.

902
01:37:50,689 --> 01:37:52,689
They gave it all to us.

903
01:37:52,689 --> 01:37:55,689
So we can learn Heptaกpode?

904
01:37:55,689 --> 01:37:58,689
If you learn it... really learn it,

905
01:37:58,689 --> 01:38:01,689
you get to perceive time the way they do.

906
01:38:01,689 --> 01:38:03,689
So you get to see whats to happen.

907
01:38:03,689 --> 01:38:06,689
But time, it isn't the same for them.

908
01:38:06,689 --> 01:38:08,689
- It is not linear.
- Look...

909
01:38:08,689 --> 01:38:11,689
We did our best but it wasn't enough.

910

Ian, Louise... It was an honor
to work with you.

912
01:38:20,689 --> 01:38:22,689
Good luck.

913
01:38:25,689 --> 01:38:26,689
Colonel...

914
01:38:33,689 --> 01:38:35,689
I'll find out where we are going.

915
01:38:43,689 --> 01:38:45,689
Wake up, Mummy.

916
01:39:21,689 --> 01:39:23,689
Dr. Banks...

917
01:39:24,689 --> 01:39:25,689
Its a pleasure.

918
01:39:25,689 --> 01:39:29,689
General Shang, the pleasure is mine.

919
01:39:29,689 --> 01:39:31,689
Your president said...

920
01:39:31,689 --> 01:39:35,689
It was an honor to host me in celebration.

921
01:39:35,689 --> 01:39:37,689
- Of course.
- I confess...

922
01:39:37,689 --> 01:39:41,689
The only reason why I am here is...

923
01:39:42,689 --> 01:39:44,689
To meet you in person.

924
01:39:45,689 --> 01:39:48,689
Well, Im flattered. Thank you.

925
01:39:48,689 --> 01:39:52,689
18 months ago, you did something remarkable.

926
01:39:53,689 --> 01:39:57,689
Something not even my superior has done.

927
01:39:59,689 --> 01:40:02,689
- What's that?
- You changed my mind.

928
01:40:04,689 --> 01:40:08,689
You are the reason for this unification.

929
01:40:09,689 --> 01:40:12,689
All because you reached out to
me on my private number.

930
01:40:15,689 --> 01:40:18,689
Your private number?
General I do not know your private number...

931
01:40:26,689 --> 01:40:27,689
Now you know.

932
01:40:30,689 --> 01:40:33,689
I claimed to know how your mind works,
but...

933
01:40:34,689 --> 01:40:37,689
I believe it was important
for you to see that.

934
01:40:39,689 --> 01:40:41,689
I called you tonight?

935
01:40:42,689 --> 01:40:43,689
Yes, you did.

936
01:40:55,689 --> 01:40:57,689
Louise...

937
01:41:13,689 --> 01:41:15,689
Alright, let's shut down the system.

938
01:41:15,689 --> 01:41:19,689
Sir... there's a satelite
here dialling China.

939
01:41:21,689 --> 01:41:23,689
Here? What do you mean here?

940
01:41:25,689 --> 01:41:27,689
Come on, answer.

941
01:41:28,689 --> 01:41:30,689
Whose phone is it?

942
01:41:34,689 --> 01:41:36,689
It's your phone, sir.

943
01:41:42,689 --> 01:41:44,689
Search base camp now.

944
01:41:44,689 --> 01:41:47,689
Find out who is using that phone.

945
01:41:47,689 --> 01:41:49,689
- Hold on to those co-ordinates.
- Yes sir.

946
01:41:49,689 --> 01:41:52,689
C'mon... What am I saying?

947
01:41:53,689 --> 01:41:54,689
What am I saying?

948
01:41:55,689 --> 01:41:57,689
okay.

949
01:42:05,689 --> 01:42:06,689
okay.

950
01:42:07,689 --> 01:42:10,689
I never forget what you said.

951
01:42:21,689 --> 01:42:24,689
You told me my wife's dying words.

952
01:42:42,689 --> 01:42:43,689
We found the source of the phone call.

953
01:42:43,689 --> 01:42:46,689
It is in decontamination.
Waiting for instructions.

954
01:42:47,689 --> 01:42:49,689
Louise... What are you doing?

955
01:42:50,689 --> 01:42:52,689
- What are you doing?
- Changing his opinion.

956
01:42:52,689 --> 01:42:54,689
Buy us 20 seconds.

957
01:42:54,689 --> 01:42:56,689
- We do not have time.
- Trust me.

958
01:42:56,689 --> 01:42:59,689
- 20 seconds. Do you trust me?
- Now? It's all right.

959
01:42:59,689 --> 01:43:01,689
Dr. Banks...

960
01:43:03,689 --> 01:43:05,689
Drop the phone, or we shoot.

961
01:43:08,689 --> 01:43:11,689
- Drop it!
- Im sorry!

962
01:43:13,689 --> 01:43:15,689
This is an act of treason!

963
01:43:21,689 --> 01:43:23,689
- Drop it!
- Its done.

964
01:43:23,689 --> 01:43:25,689
I got it.

965
01:43:39,689 --> 01:43:42,689
The communications blackout
from all 12 landing sites...

966
01:43:42,689 --> 01:43:45,689
continues this evening...

967
01:43:45,689 --> 01:43:48,689
Hold on... We are just hearing.

968
01:43:48,689 --> 01:43:51,689
- We are going to cut this report to tell you.
- Latest news.

969
01:43:51,689 --> 01:43:53,689
China has called an emergency
press conference...

970
01:43:53,689 --> 01:43:56,689
General Shang, chief of the
People's Liberation Army...

971
01:43:56,689 --> 01:44:00,689
Has announced in an emergency press
conference that China is standing down.

972
01:44:00,689 --> 01:44:02,689
China is stating that all the intelligence
they have received...

973
01:44:03,689 --> 01:44:06,689
Will be shared immediately...

974
01:44:06,689 --> 01:44:09,689
The world is entering a new era...

975
01:44:09,689 --> 01:44:12,689
The Russian army are now revealing

976
01:44:12,689 --> 01:44:16,689
information they acquired
from both their landing sites...

977
01:46:08,689 --> 01:46:12,689
So, Hannah...

978
01:46:13,689 --> 01:46:15,689
This is where your story begins.

979
01:46:17,689 --> 01:46:19,689
The day they departed.

980
01:46:23,689 --> 01:46:25,689
Are you alright?

981
01:46:28,689 --> 01:46:31,689
Despite knowing the journey...

982
01:46:31,689 --> 01:46:33,689
and where it leads...

983
01:46:35,689 --> 01:46:37,689
I embrace it.

984
01:46:40,689 --> 01:46:43,689
And I welcome every moment of it.

985
01:46:58,689 --> 01:47:02,689
H-A-N-N-A-H.

986
01:47:16,689 --> 01:47:18,689
Now backwards.

987
01:47:18,689 --> 01:47:22,689
H-A-N-N-A-H.

988
01:47:22,689 --> 01:47:24,689
Hannah.

989
01:47:28,689 --> 01:47:29,689
You ready, baby?

990
01:47:30,689 --> 01:47:33,689
- Hey.
- Hey.

991
01:47:33,689 --> 01:47:34,689
- It's okay?
- Yes you can go.

992
01:47:35,689 --> 01:47:37,689
Daddy!

993
01:47:46,689 --> 01:47:49,689
Are you ok?
I'll just roll over you.

994
01:47:52,689 --> 01:47:54,689
Are you ready?

995
01:47:58,689 --> 01:48:00,689
Guess what... All star stuff.

996
01:48:02,689 --> 01:48:04,689
- Ian.
- Yeah.

997
01:48:04,689 --> 01:48:06,689
If you see your whole life,
from start to finish...

998
01:48:10,689 --> 01:48:12,689
Would you change things?

999
01:48:18,689 --> 01:48:20,689
Maybe I...

1000
01:48:21,689 --> 01:48:24,689
I say what I feel more often. I don't know.

1001
01:48:40,689 --> 01:48:42,689
I've had my head tilted up to the stars

1002
01:48:42,689 --> 01:48:44,689
for as long as I can remember.

1003
01:48:46,689 --> 01:48:49,689
But you know what surprised me?

1004
01:48:51,689 --> 01:48:53,689
It was not meeting them.

1005
01:48:58,689 --> 01:48:59,689
It was meeting you.

1006
01:49:40,689 --> 01:49:43,689
I'd forgotten how good it felt
to be held by you.

1007
01:49:53,689 --> 01:49:54,689
Do you want to make a baby?

1008
01:50:31,689 --> 01:50:32,689
Yes... yeah!

1009
01:50:33,305 --> 01:50:39,882
