00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:26,990

2
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,700
I used to think this was
the beginning of your story.

3
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,700
Memory is a strange thing.

4
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,700
It does not work like I thought it did.

5
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,700
We are so bound by time.

6
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,700
By its order.

7
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,699
It's okay. Come back to me.

8
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,700
Come back to me.

9
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,700
Come back to me.

10
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:31,700
Stick em up!

11
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,700
You are the sheriff in this here town?

12
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,700
My tickle guns are gonna get you!

13
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,700
You want me to chase you? You better run.

14
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,700
I remember moments in the middle.

15
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,700
I love you.

16
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,700
I hate you!

17
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,700
And this was the end.

18
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,700
Come back to me.

19
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,700
Baby, come back to me.

20
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,700
And now Im not so sure I believe in
beginnings and endings.

21
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,700
There are days that define
your story beyond your life.

22
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,700
Like the day they arrived.

23
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,700
Good Morning.

24
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,700
Where is everyone?

25
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,699
Ok... Well let's get started.

26
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,699
Today, we're talking about Portuguese

27
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,700
and why it sounds so different
from the other Romance languages.

28
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,700
The story of Portuguese begins
in the Kingdom of Galicia...

29
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,699
In the Middle Ages...

30
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,700
when a language was seen
as an expression of art.

31
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,699
Any news you want to share?

32
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,700
Dr. Banks can turn you turn the TV to
the news channel?

33
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,699
But police have already
set up a perimeter around the area

34
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,699
<i>As you can see, we got just
about as close as we can...</i>

35
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,699
<i>but unfortunately, Montana right now,
is on complete lock down.</i>

36
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,699
<i>The object apparently touched down...</i>

37
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,699
<i>40 minutes ago,
just north of ****** 04.</i>

38
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,700
<i>We are waiting to hear if this is perhaps
an experimental vessel or...</i>

39
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,699
<i>Hold on...</i>

40
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,699
<i>Im learning that more objects like this</i>

41
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,699
<i>Have landed in as many as eight other
locations around the world</i>

42
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,700
<i>Yes? Henry?</i>

43
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,699
<i>This is from a site in Hokkaido.</i>

44
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,700
<i>This is worldwide and is
happening right now.</i>

45
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,700
Okay... um...

46
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,700
Class is dismissed.

47
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,699
<i>The Pentagon is simply asking
for cooperation</i>

48
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,699
<i>while authorities assess the object.</i>

49
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,700
<i>You are saying its not ours?</i>

50
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:11,699
<i>- Do you even know if its from Earth?
- We are collecting information.</i>

51
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,699
<i>We're coordinating with other countries.</i>

52
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,700
<i>We are not the only ones to
have one of these in our backyard.</i>

53
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,699
<i>If this is some kind of
peaceful first contact,</i>

54
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,700
<i>why send twelve? Why not just one?</i>

55
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,699
I do not know, Mom.

56
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,700
Im watching the same news you are.

57
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,699
Mom... mom, please don't bother
with that channel.

58
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,700
How many times I have to say that
those people are idiots?

59
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,700
Do I sound nervous?

60
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,700
Ok, exactly... so...

61
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,700
Yeah, me? You know me. Im about the same

62
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,700
Mom, I'm fine.

63
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,700
Ok, I'll call you later - bye.

64
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,699
<i>And in around eight hours after landing,</i>

65
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,699
<i>Theres still no signs of what
might be called "first contact."</i>

66
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,699
<i>The objects measuring
at least 1500ft tall...</i>

67
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,699
<i>Two more have reported to

00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,700
<i>it may be unmanned.</i>

75

<i>Purchase of gas, water and food

I'm Colonel G.T. Weber.

92
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,699
We havn't formally met,
but two years ago,

93
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,700
You did a Farsi translation
for the Intellengy?

94
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,700
And you made quick work
with those insurgents.

95
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,700
You're on top...

96
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,699
on everyone's list
when it comes to translations.

97
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,699
And yet youve been two years in the SSBI.

98
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,699
So, you still have top secret clearance.

99
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,700
So thats why I'm in your office
and not in Berkeley.

100
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,700
Okay?

101
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,700
I have something I need you
to translate for me.

102
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
<i>Why are you here?</i>

103
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,700
<i>Can you understand us?</i>

104
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,700
<i>Where did you come from?</i>

105
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,700
Now you heard...
what you make of it?

106
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,700
- Is that...?
- Yes.

107
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,699
- How many?
- How many what?

108
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,700
How many were speaking?

109
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,700
Two.

110
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,700
They were speaking at the same time.

111
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,699
Are you sure they had mouths...

112
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,700
How would you approach translating this?

113
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,700
You hear any words? Phrases?

114
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,700
I do not... I do not know.

115
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,700
So what can you tell?

116
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:08,699
I can tell you that it is impossible to
translate an audio file.

117
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,699
I would need to be there
to interact with them.

118
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,699
You did not need that
for Farsi translation.

119
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,700
I did not need because I already
knew the language, but this is...

120
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,699
I know what you're doing.

121
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,699
- Tell me what Im doing.
- I'll not take you to Montana.

122
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,599
Its all I can do to
keep it turning into a

123
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:31,699
tourist site for everybody
who has a clearance.

124
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,699
Im just telling you what it would take
to do this job.

125
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,700
It is not a negotiation.

126
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,700
If I leave here... your chance is gone.

127
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,699
Good day.

128
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,700
Colonel...

129
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,699
You mentioned Berkeley.
Are you going to ask Danvers next?

130
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,700
Maybe.

131
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,700
Before you commit to him...

132
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:02,901
ask him the Sanskrit word for "war"
and its translation.

00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,699
Gavisti.
He says that means discussion.

139
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,699
- What you say means?
- A desire for more cows.

140
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,700
Pack your bags.

141
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,700
- All right, give me 20 minutes.
- Take only 10!

142

Dr. Banks! This way, please.

143
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,700
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

144
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,700
Thanks.

145
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,700
Sorry. Couldn't hear what you were saying.

00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,700
- Quite a reading!
- Yeah... you wrote it.

151
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,700
Yeah.

152
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:38,699

you write as a preface.

Dabbled with the basics.

154
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,700
It's great. Even if its wrong.

155
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,699
- Its wrong?
- The cornerstone of civilization

156
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,860
isn't language - its science.

Thats what they are calling the UFO?

160
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,699
Priority One. What do they want,
Where are they from?

161
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,699
Beyond that, how did they get here?

162
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,699
Are they capable of faster
than light travel?

163
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,580
I made a list of questions ranging from
handshakes to binary sequences...

164
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,700
How about we just talk to them

165
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:20,700
before we start throwing problem at them?

166
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,700
That's why you both are here.

167
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,700
I'll bring the coffee.

168
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,700
Coffee with some aliens.

169
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,700
- Take them to Dr. Kettler.
- Yes sir.

170
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,699
The procedure takes just a few minutes,
then we'll start.

171
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,700
Alright.

172
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,699
They will take care of your bags...

173
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,700
and cell phones.

174
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,699
Follow me.

175
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,700
Put this on and wear them all times.

176
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,700
Sir, they're here.

177
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,699
Louise Banks, Ian Donnelly.

178
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,699
When was your last meal?

179
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,699
- Last night.
- Same.

180
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,699
When was the last time
you did something stressful?

181
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,700
Does now count?

182
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,699
- Just saying.
- Who's being...

183
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,699
Carted off in a med-bag?

184
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,699
Not everyone is able to process
experiences like this.

185
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,699
Im gonna take some bllod from you.

186
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,699
And give you an immunization doze to

187
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,699
cover you against bacterial threats.
Can you sign this please?

188
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,699
Before we can start.

189
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,699
- Are any of you claustrophobic?
- No.

190
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,700
Are taking any medication, any allergies?

191
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,700
Pregnant?

192
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,699
The boost doze may give
a kick to your systems,

193
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,699
so you may experience side effects:

194
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,699
like nausea, dizziness, headaches.

195
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,700
Or even a ringing in your ears.

196
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,699
<i>In exactly 112 minutes and 19 seconds</i>

197
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,699
<i>gravity starts to shift
and fall out of the room.</i>

198
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,699
Have you found a scientific explanation
for it?

199
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,700
- Like is it for them?
- No, I think it is for us.

200
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,699
<i>There seems to circulate air inside
the chamber, so...</i>

201
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,699
<i>After two hours, you run out of oxygen.</i>

202
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,699
It doesn't take you 18 hours to pump
fresh air into a room?

203
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,700
Atmosphere.

204
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,699
- Excuse me?
- If their atmosphere

205
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,700
is different from earth,

206
00:22:04,701 --> 00:22:07,699
It would take hours to balance
the concentration of air

207
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,699
and the pressure everytime
we open their door.

208
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,699
Are you saying that could suffocate us
if they wanted to?

209
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,699
This is Agent David Halpern, the CIA.

210
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,699
- Let me take you to your stations.
- Yes sir.

211
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,699
We need the answers as soon as possible.

212
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,699
What they want, where they came from.

213
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,699
Why you are here, this is the priority.

214
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,700
Everyone.

215
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:30,699
This is Dr. Ian Donnelly,
he will lead the team.

216
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,699
Have they responded to anything?
Shapes, patterns,

217
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,699
numbers, Fibonacci?

218
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,580
We can't tell what they were saying,
but they responded to "hello", so...

219
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,700
Ok that is all.

220
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,700
What have you figured out?

221
00:22:44,701 --> 00:22:47,699
We're just getting started.
Good Morning.

222
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,699
This is Dr Louise Banks.

223
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,699
- She will be heading your team.
- Dr. Banks, its a pleasure

224
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,700
Dr. Banks is taking over the mission
from Dr. Waller.

225
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,700
The 15 minute alarm.

226
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,699
What kind of radiation are we walking into?

227
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,699
No, this is just for safety.

228
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,700
So is there any physical contact...

229
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,699
with them?
I'm the only one using the word: aliens?

230
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,700
It has a wall made of glass,
we do not make contact.

231
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,700
What they look like?

232
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,700
You'll see soon enough. Hurry up.

233
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,699
The suits are clumsy at first.

234
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,700
But you'll get used to them.

235
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,700
All personnel in the second vehicle.

236
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,900
We get there in a few minutes.

237
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,700
Make sure you hold onto something.

238
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,700
Every 18 hours... the door
opens at the bottom.

239
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,700
Thats when we go in.

240
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,700
Yeah, that has happened.

241
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,700
Alright, lets move. Time is wasting.

242
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,700
You ready?

243
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,700
You ready?

244
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,699
It's okay, sir.

245
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,820
- You can proceed.
- Stand by

246
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,700
Okay, bring it up.

247
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,700
You okay?

248
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,700
Yeah.

249
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,700
Dr. Banks.

250
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,699
You can do it. C'mon.

251
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,700
I... I think...

252
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,700
Grab her.

253
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,700
Dr. Donnelly, you cool?

254
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,700
Yeah!

255
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,700
Holy fuck!

256
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,700
We go down in there,

257
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,700
You can start your job.

258
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,699
- Ok.
- Ok.

259
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,700
- Everybody, move up.
- Alpha Team in position.

260
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,700
We're on the move.

261
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,700
Setting up equipment...

262
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,700
What happens now?

263
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,700
They'll arrive.

264
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,700
Dr. Banks?

265
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,700
Dr. Banks?

266
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,700
You can start.

267
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,700
Wait... Just a minute.

268
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,700
I'm fired?

269
00:33:38,701 --> 00:33:40,700
You were better than the last guy.

270
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,700
That does not make me feel any better.

271
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,699
You have till 0200 hours
to think something up.

272
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,700
And what happens then?

273
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,700
You go back in.

274
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:31,699
Violence continues to spread across the US
today due to 2 bombings.

275
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,699
The President has declared
a mandatory dusk to dawn curfew

276
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,699
after the crack down by the National Guard

277
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,699
Failed to prevent a third night
of looting across the country.

278
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,699
In North Dakota, 144 members of
the St. Lawrence Pentecostal occult

279
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,780
Are feared dead after they
set their compound ablaze.

280
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,699
Their website claims, the arrival of aliens

281
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,700
Set in motion a prophecy that 12...

282
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,699
Uh.. we're up in 15...
You got any new intel?

283
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,700
Yeah. We've been playing back
some of their sounds...

284
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,700
And where has that got you?

285
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:24,699
When they play audio back at us.
Its from an unseen source

286
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,699
What are you up with?

287
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,700
Conversations from inside the
room. Branches of dialogue.

288
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,700
We have nothing.

289
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,700
- Whats that for?
- Visual aid.

290
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,699
Look, I'm never going to
be able to speak their words,

291
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,700
if they aren't talking.

292
00:36:16,701 --> 00:36:18,699
But they might have some sort of
written language

293
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,700
or basis for visual communication.

294
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,700
Ok. Let's start.

295
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,700
Human.

296
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,700
Human.

297
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,700
I'm human.

298
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,700
And you?

299
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,700
Human.

300
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,699
- Oh my God.
- Are you recording this?

301
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,700
Yes sir. I have sent this to base.

302
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,700
Louise, its incredible!

303
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,700
Human.

304
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,700
Human.

305
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,700
Human.

306
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,700
Okay... Slow down Louise.

307
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,699
I don't want to take
away from your success,

308
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,699
but Dr. Banks,
is it really the right approach?

309
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,699
Try to teach them
how to speak and read?

310
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,699
- Thats gonna take long.
- You're wrong!

311
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,700
Its faster.

312
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,700
Everything you do here,

313
00:39:37,701 --> 00:39:40,699
I have to explain to a
room full of men,

314
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,699
whose first and last question

315
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,699
Is how can this be used against us.

316
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,700
So you'll have to give me more than that!

317
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,699
Kangaroo.

318
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,699
What is that?

319
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,699
In 1770,

320
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,699
Captain James Cook's ship ran aground

321
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,699
off the coast of Australia and led a party,

322
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,699
where they found the aboriginal people.

323
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,699
One of the sailors pointed to the animals

324
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,699
that hop around and
put their babies in their pouch,

325
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,700
And he asked what they were.
The Aborigines said "kangaroo".

326
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,699
And your point is?

327
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,699
It wasn't until later that they learned
that "kangaroo" means

328
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,699
"I don't understand". So...

329
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,699
I need this so that
we don't misinterpret things in there,

330
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,700
otherwise it is going to take 10 times
as long.

331
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,700
I can sell that for now.

332
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,699
But I need you to submit
your vocabulary of words

333
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,700
before the next session.

334
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,700
Remember what happened to the Aborigines.

335
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,700
A more advanced race,
nearly wiped them out.

336
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,700
- Its a good story.
- Thanks.

337
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,700
Its not true, but it proves my point.

338
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,700
HUMAN?

339
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,699
I think we can present some
prime numbers here.

340
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,699
- It's something.
- Congratulations, you're a parrot.

341
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,699
Its a lot more than that,
you cheeky bastard. Dont you see?

342
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,699
They can't seem to follow our algebra.

343
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,700
But complex behaviours - that clears.

344
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,700
That does not make any sense, does it?

345
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,699
Problem is, not everyone shares

346
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,699
our policy of being open with the aliens.

347
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,700
That is Gen. Shang.

348
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,699
It is gathering strength in Shanghai

349
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,699
and at least four other nations
would follow him.

350
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,700
- Louise, we need get ground today.
- Ok.

351
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,699
You're gonna teach them your name
and Ian's?

352
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,699
Yes, so that we can learn their names,
if they have names,

353
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,699
and then introduce pronouns later.

354
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,699
These are grade school words.

355
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,700
Eating, walking.

356
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,700
Help me understand.

357
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,700
No no no! Not the top!

358
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,699
Ok, this is where you
want to get to, right?

359
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,699
- That is the question.
- Right.

360
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,700
So, first we need to make sure that
they understand what a question is.

361
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,699
The nature of our request for information

362
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,700
on the response.

363
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:50,699
Then we need to clarify

364
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,699
the difference between a specific "you"...

365
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,699
and a collective "you".

366
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,699
We don't want to know why
a 'Joe' alien is here,

367
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,699
we want to know why they all landed.

368
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,699
A purpose requires an understanding
of intent.

369
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,699
We need to find out do they make
conscious choices,

370
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,699
or is the motivation so instinctive

371
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,860
that they don't understand
any why "?" question at all.

372
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:18,699
And biggest of all we need to have
enough vocabulary with them,

373
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,700
that we understand their answer.

374
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,700
Yeah.

375
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,699
Stick to your list.

376
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,700
Just...

377
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,700
Don't add anything to it.

378
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,700
Let's get started.

379
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,699
Louise.

380
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,700
Louise, I'm Louise.

381
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,700
What is that?

382
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,699
Is that a new symbol?
I can't tell.

383
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,699
I don't know,
I think its the symbol for "human" again.

384
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,699
But with a curl at the end.

385
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,700
Maybe they indicate a question.
I don't know.

386
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,699
I do not know, Louise,
I think they are confused.

387
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,700
Dr. Banks, move to the next word.

388
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,700
Dr. Banks!

389
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,699
- Its okay.
- Whats going on?

390
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,700
What are you doing?

391
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,699
- Im fine.
- Are you crazy?

392
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,699
They need to see me.

393
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,700
She's taking off protection.
Dr. Banks!

394
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,699
Are you ok?
You are at risk of contamination.

395
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,700
- They need to see me.
- Dr. Banks.

396
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,700
- Dr. Banks.
- She's going upto the screen.

397
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,700
Should we abort?

398
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,700
Go back to your stations.

399
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,700
Now that's a proper introduction.

400
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,700
Louise.

401
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,699
I'm Louise.

402
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,700
Ian, you want to introduce yourself?

403
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,700
I...

404
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,700
Louise.

405
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,700
Fuck you.

406
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,860
Everyone dies one day, right?

407
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:37,699
Sir, Donnelly is taking off his suit too.

408
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,699
Permission to abort?

409
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,700
Continue with the session.

410
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,699
Ian.

411
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,700
Louise.

412
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:03,700
You?

413
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,700
Who are you?

414
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,700
I think those are their names.

415
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,699
They have names.

416
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,700
So what are we gonna call them?

417
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,700
I do not know.

418
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,700
I was thinking of Abbott and Costello.

419
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,700
Yeah.

420
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:55,700
I like it.

421
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,700
I like it.

422
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,700
Vehicle One, exit your vehicles
and proceed to the decontamination camp.

423
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:29,700
Do not take off the masks until they enter.

424
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,699
Do not remove their masks,

425
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,700
and adhere to the decontamination room.

426
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,700
- How do you feel?
- Overworked.

427
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,700
Like I said, I need to tell you,
you put yourself at risk.

428
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,699
There is no signs of radiation poisoning...
yet.

429
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,699
I'll check your blood.

430
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,700
- For now, Im gonna give you another boost.
- Ok.

431
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:43,699
- No radiation?
- Nothing else we can detect either.

432
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,699
But I will still give her a strong
cocktail, regardless.

433
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,700
It was the first time we made
significant progress.

434
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,700
Alright. We'll take the risk.

435
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,699
- Honey... honey.
- What's going on?

436
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,699
- Can you tell me something?
- No.

437
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:03,699
- You are worried.
- How can I not worry?

438
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,699
Calm down.

439
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,699
Becky asked if the monsters
are going to kill Dad.

440
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,700
Honey, its not gonna happen.

441
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,699
- Come soon, please.
- No need to worry.

442
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,700
I'm so scared.

443
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,699
Here are some of the many things

444
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,699
we don't know about the heptopodes.

445
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,699
Greek: Hepta seven. Pod foot.

446
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,700
Seven feet. Hept치pode.

447
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,700
Who are they?

448
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:51,699
Trying to answer this in any meaningful
way is hampered by the fact that,

449
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,699
outside of being able to see them
and hear them,

450
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,700
They have deposited
absolutely no footprint.

451
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,699
The chemical composition of their
spaceship is unknown.

452
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:06,699
The Shell emits no waste,
no gas, no radiation.

453
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,699
Assuming that the ships
communicate with each other,

454
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,699
they do so without detection.

455
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,699
The air between the shells is controlled

456
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,700
by sonic emissions or light waves.

457
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,699
They are scientists or tourists?

458
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,700
If scientists,
they don't seem to ask a lot of questions.

459
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,700
Why they land in these places?

460
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,699
The world's most decorated experts
can not figure that out.

461
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:36,699
The most plausible theory is that
they chose places on earth

462
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,699
With the lowest incidences of
lightning strikes.

463
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,699
But there are exceptions.

464
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,699
The second most plausible theory
is that Sheena Easton

465
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,699
Had a hit song in each of
these sites in 1980.

466
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,700
So... we just don't know.

467
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,700
How do they communicate?

468
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,699
Here, Louise has brought us all to shame.

469
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,699
The first breakthrough was discovering
that there is no co-relation

470
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:04,700
between what a hept치pode says,
and what a hept치pode writes.

471
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,700
IAN YOU

472
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,699
Unlike all human written language,

473
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,699
their writing is semasiogr치fica.

474
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:28,700
It conveyes meaning,
it does not represent sound.

475
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:37,699
Perhaps they view our form of writing
as a wasted oppurtunity,

476
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,700
Passing every second
communication's channel.

477
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,699
We have our friends in Pakistan to thank

478
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,700
For their study on how the
hept치podes write.

479
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,699
Because unlike speech,

480
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,700
a hologram is free of time.

481
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,699
Like their ship or their bodies.

482
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:04,699
Their written language has no form
or no direction.

483
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,699
Linguists call this nonlinear orthography.

484
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:11,700
Which raises the question:
"Is this how they think?"

485
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,699
Imagine you wanted to write a sentence

486
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,700
using 2 hands, starting from either side.

487
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,699
You have to know each word
you wanted to use,

488
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,700
as well as how much space they will occupy.

489
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,699
A hept치pode can write a complex sentence

490
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,699
in two seconds effortlessly.

491
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,700
It took us a month to make
the simplest vocabulary.

492
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:37,699
Next, explain the vocabulary.

493
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,700
Louise thinks it will easily take
another month to get ready for that.

494
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,700
Hey.

495
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,700
- Hi.
- Weber's looking for you.

496
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,700
Why do you think I'm hiding out here?

497
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,700
C'mon up.

498
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:20,700
- Nice out here, huh?
- Yeah, it's a nice view.

499
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,700
Away from the noise.

500
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,700
You know, I was just thinking about you.

501
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:34,700
You approach language like a
mathematician. You know that right?

502
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,699
I will take that as a compliment.

503
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,700
But it is.

504
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:44,700
And... I want you to

505
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:47,699
Steer us around these communication traps

506
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,699
that I did not even know existed.

507
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:50,700
What...?

508
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,700
I guess this is why I'm still single.

509
00:56:54,701 --> 00:56:58,699
Trust me, you can understand communication

510
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:59,700
and still end up single.

511
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,700
I feel like everything
that happens there...

512
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,700
It comes down to the 2 of us.

513
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:20,700
It's a good thing, alright? You and I?

514
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:26,700
See those jokers that
we are working with?

515
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,700
Thank God, I got you.

516
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,700
<b>ALIEN CRISIS | DAY 25 VENEZUELA</b>

517
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:39,700
<b>UNITED KINGDOM SAVE OUR SPECIES!</b>

518
00:57:39,701 --> 00:57:43,700
Tonight, the first photo of the aliens
goes viral.

519
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,699
Biological contamination is a
major risk factor

520
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,699
At the Montana site. So say environmental
pressure groups.

521
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,699
800,000 march on Washington

522
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:55,699
to protest the government's handling
on the crisis.

523
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,700
All this and more, special coverage.

524
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,699
First contact was inside that thing.

525
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,699
Who's in charge? The government, of course.

526
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:09,699
The same government who ruined our
backyard and bankrupted our military.

527
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,699
Look at these people.
Most of them don't even have guns.

528
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,699
We could be facing a full scale
invasion invasion.

529
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:18,699
Our President is willing to sit back,
and let them overtake the country.

530
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:21,699
We are falling asleep at the wheel, people!

531
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,699
You know what Im talking about!

532
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,699
The smartest thing to do right now,
would be a show of force.

533
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,699
I'm talking about a shot across the brow.

534
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:33,700
I want to know what you think
about all this.

535
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,700
Whats this word?

536
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,700
Green Planet...

537
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:28,699
The Earth is a planet.

538
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:31,699
Want to see my project
for Miss. Garrett's class?

539
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,700
Of course, little nose.

540
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,700
We had to make up our own TV show.

541
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,699
If we had one.

542
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:44,699
- Who are those two people?
- Thats you and Dad.

543
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,820
The show is called: "Mommy and Daddy
talk to animals."

544
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:51,700
Its lovely.

545
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:57,700
Ok.

546
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,501
It's okay to be sad
that your dad and I...

547
01:00:04,513 --> 01:00:05,700
I know. I'm not.

548
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,699
We both love you very much.

549
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:12,699
I know. It's just a drawing - not real.

550
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:13,700
Louise?

551
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:19,700
Are you alright?

552
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:23,700
Yes I'm fine.

553
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:27,940
I not sure if it's something...

554
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:29,700
I can explain.

555
01:00:29,701 --> 01:00:31,700
Would you like a checkup
with Dr. Kevin?

556
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,699
I am ok.

557
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,700
It's fine, I'm ok.

558
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:41,700
How are you feeling?

559
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,700
I need some sleep, but...

560
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:49,700
I am fine.

561
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,699
Yeah?

562
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:56,700
I've been doing a bit of reading
about this idea that...

563
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:01,699
What if you emmerse yourself into
a foreign language...

564
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:05,700
- You can actually rewire your brain.
- It is a hypothesis.

565
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:07,700
It is a theory that...

566
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,699
It is the theory that...

567
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:14,699
The language you speak
determines how you think.

568
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:17,700
Yes, it affects how you see everything...

569
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:22,700
I'm curious. Are you dreaming
in their language?

570
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:34,700
I've had some dreams.

571
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:39,700
I don't think that makes me
unfit to do this job.

572
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,700
- Did you sleep?
- A little.

573
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,700
Know Mandarin?

574
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:21,700
The voice you're about to hear
belongs to the Chinese military chief.

575
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:24,700
General Shang.

576
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,700
Put it on.

577
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:33,700
We also have a live feed,
if you want to look.

578
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:35,700
Rewind.

579
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:38,700
Stop.

580
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:43,060
He is saying each of the 12
is offering advanced technology.

581
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:49,700
Go back again... play.

582
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:56,699
The scientific team is attempting
to decode the sense...

583
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:59,700
"sense"?
I dont know what that means.

584
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,699
Something that will manage.

585
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:06,700
Suits, honor and flowers. I don't...

586
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:11,699
- I don't know, that's all.
- I don't know what it means either.

587
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:14,699
An hour ago, China mobilized forces...

588
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,699
and now Russia is following suit.

589
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:18,700
Shang is about to start something.

590
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:21,700
All same suits... Suits...

591
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:26,699
suits, honor, flowers...

592
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,700
Colonel, those are all parts of Mahjong.

593
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,699
God... are they...?

594
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,700
They are using a game to communicate
with the Hept璥odes?

595
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,699
Maybe... why?

596
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:43,699
Lets say I taught them
chess instead of English.

597
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:47,699
Every conversation would be a game,
every idea expressed through opposition.

598
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,700
Victory... defeat. You see the problem?

599
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:53,699
If all I ever gave you was a hammer...

600
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:55,700
Everythings a nail.

601
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,700
We need to ask the big question.

602
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,700
Ready or not.

603
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,700
Hept치podes purpose.

604
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:04,700
Purpose of hept치pode.
Earth. What is your purpose?

605
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,700
Do we only have Costello?

606
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:19,700
Ok. There you are.

607
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,700
What is he saying?

608
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:53,700
Offer weapon.

609
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:02,699
You saw what they wrote. Using a word that
they don't fully understand.

610
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,699
Enough!

611
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,699
Louise.

612
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:08,699
We don't know if they understand

613
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:11,699
the difference between a weapon and a tool.

614
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:15,699
Our language like a culture is messy,
and sometimes one can be both.

615
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:18,699
I think it's quite possible that they are
asking us or them for something.

616
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,699
Not the other way round.

617
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,699
Like the first part of trade.

618
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,699
So how do we clarify their intentions
beyond these two words?

619
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:29,699
I go back in.. right
away we go back in... we clear this out..

620
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:32,700
- It's more complicated than that.
- How is it more complicated than that?

621
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:36,700
Col., the Secretary of Defense
is on the line for you.

622
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:47,699
We need to sit on this information
till we know what it means.

623
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,699
So we aren't sharing it with our enemies.
We have to consider the idea

624
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:53,699
that our visitors are prodding us
to fight among ourselves,

625
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,699
till only one faction prevails.

626
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,699
- There is no evidence for that.
- Sure there is.

627
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,699
Just grab a history book.

628
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,700
British in India, Germans with Rwanda.

629
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:05,700
They even got a name for it in Hungary.

630
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:15,699
We are a world with no single leader.

631
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,699
Its impossible to deal with just one of us.

632
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:20,699
We have the word weapon now...

633
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,700
Yes general.

634
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:48,700
What did they say?

635
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,699
China and Russia are off the grid.
They aren't speaking very well.

636
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:55,700
What they learnt in the last session
has them spooked.

637
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:59,700
Yes sir.

638
01:08:59,701 --> 01:09:01,699
We have orders to do the same.

639
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:04,699
- Wait these are our allies!
- Put your radio on silence!

640
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,700
- Do it.
- We received a message from the hept치...

641
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,699
Damn it!

642
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:14,700
We need to be talking to each other!
Find out what this means.

643
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,700
This cam is now offline...

644
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:32,699
We've never re-entered the session before.

645
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:34,699
Louise, trust me ok? We got time.

646
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:36,700
Just gotta step on it, alright?

647
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:39,699
<b>"USE WEAPON"</b>

648
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:42,699
This is the alien message sent to provoke

649
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,510
the Chinese government
to withdraw their

650
01:09:44,522 --> 01:09:46,699
scientists from the
international mission today.

651
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:49,699
In a statement, General Shang said:

652
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:51,699
"China no longer trusts the aliens

653
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:52,700
who wants to divide us.

654
01:09:52,701 --> 01:09:54,699
Humanity must be protected."

655
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:56,700
China has asked for immediate
talks at the UN.

656
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:04,700
Alpha 1-9, this is Condor. Over.

657
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:12,700
Alpha 1-9, this is Condor. Come in. Over.

658
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:20,699
Captain Marks, Condor, not
receiving a transmission.

659
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,700
Let me know if you are listening.

660
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:28,700
Capt. Marks, all escorts are
ordered to cease all activites...

661
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:00,699
No, no, no...
Dr. Banks you can't go in there.

662
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:02,700
- Just need to ask one question.
- Dr. Banks!

663
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:06,699
The session is closed.
You can't go back in, it's dangerous...

664
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,699
We just need 5 minutes. No sweat.

665
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,700
Morris, Let him go.

666
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,700
Hey, Abbott.

667
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:22,700
So, what are calling our session?
Session 37?

668
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:27,700
- No 36 Part 2
- Ok.

669
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:34,700
Why are you alone?

670
01:11:34,701 --> 01:11:36,699
Been attempting to call Capt. Marks.

671
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:40,699
- The escorts not responding.
- Why not?

672
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,700
Send security.

673
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:48,700
Offer a weapon... question mark.

674
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:55,700
They are offering us something.

675
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:08,699
Technology, device, method...

676
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,699
See this? This is a different word.

677
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:13,700
This... this segment is a lot busier.

678
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:21,700
Give... technology...

679
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:24,700
Now.

680
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:34,700
Whats he doing?

681
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:43,700
Capt. ****** check.

682
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,699
Security team coming, sir.

683
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:56,699
4 minutes remain.
We must see this through.

684
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,699
Come on. Download weapons.

685
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:01,699
- Fire *******.
- Understood.

686
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:03,699
We will open shooting soon.

687
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:06,700
To be no casualties.

688
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,700
Abbott wants me to write on the barrier.

689
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:45,700
I don't know.

690
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:03,700
I can't do it with both hands.

691
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:16,700
Louise.

692
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,700
What is that?

693
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:21,699
Hey... Hey... Hey... Take it easy.

694
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:24,700
You suffered a concussion.
Just lay back.

695
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:28,700
How you feeling?

696
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:40,700
- How is Ian?
- Well, same as you. He is ok.

697
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,699
- Who...

698
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,699
- Who did this?
- Some soldiers.

699
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:49,700
Been watching too much TV.

700
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:55,699
- What is that?
- Take it easy... take it easy

701
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:59,699
The place is no longer secure.
We're on standby to evacuate.

702
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:01,700
Where is Ian?

703
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,700
Weber came and got him
maybe 10 minutes ago.

704
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:07,700
He wouldn't leave till
he knew you were okay.

705
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:15,700
The whole tent is on the clock to figure
out whatever it is you were given up there.

706
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:22,700
This is all of it?

707
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,700
The feed wasn't interrupted
by the explosion.

708
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:28,700
Thats right.

709
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:33,699
- You see something?
- I don't know yet.

710
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:36,699
I need my team get together
with Louise's team.

711
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:39,699
- I need everyone working on this.
- We can not leave.

712
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:41,699
- Glad to see you awake.
- We need to go back in there

713
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:43,699
and explain to them that
this wasn't our fault.

714
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,699
- We can't go back inside.
- We have to!

715
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:47,699
What happened in there was an attack.

716
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:50,699
We can hope for the best,
but we have to prepare for retaliation.

717
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,699
We may have to evacuate...

718
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:55,700
Thats a wrong move.
As long as they stay, we have to stay.

719
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:31,700
Well, they are not leaving.

720
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:35,700
Why does it feel worse?

721
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,699
China is on the offensive.

722
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:46,699
They are positioning their military to blow
the alien vessel right out of the sky.

723
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:49,699
If this happens, we can't sit
and wait for their retaliation.

724
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:51,699
So get prepared.

725
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:54,699
The Air Force and Infantry are standing by.

726
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:57,699
<b>BREAKING NEWS</b>

727
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:00,699
Tonight, China becomes
the first world power

728
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:03,699
To declare war against the aliens.

729
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:06,699
Following the failure of the diplomatic
efforts of the United Nations,

730
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:10,699
China confirmed that its language experts
tonight...

731
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:13,699
delivered an ultimatum
at the Shanghai site.

732
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:14,700
In a televised statement,

733
01:19:14,701 --> 01:19:17,699
Gen. Shang, chairman of the
People's Liberation Army,

734
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:21,699
Said the aliens have 24 hours to
leave Chinese territory,

735
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:23,699
or face destruction.

736
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:25,699
And he urged all other world leaders

737
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:28,700
to unite with China and
take a similar stance.

738
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:32,699
With a huge build up of forces
at their landing sites,

739
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,699
Pakistan, Russia and Sudan

740
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:37,700
Are thought to be following China's lead.

741
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:55,700
It can't be random.

742
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,700
Its going to take us years.

743
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:19,700
Whats this term here?

744
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:24,700
Mum.

745
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:29,699
- Mother?
- Hm?

746
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:33,699
- Sweetie?
- Whats this term for that thing...

747
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:35,699
Like a technical term...

748
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:38,699
When we make a deal and we
both get something out of it?

749
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:41,700
- A compromise?
- No...

750
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:44,699
Like it's competition,

751
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:47,700
But both sides end up happy.

752
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:50,699
And win-win?

753
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:52,699
More sciency than that.

754
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:55,700
If you want science, call your father.

755
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:11,700
Thank you.

756
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:23,699
Sorry.

757
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:26,700
Its okay.

758
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:32,700
What time is it?

759
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:36,700
Its time to open the bottle
you've been hiding.

760
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:42,700
You cracked something, didn't you?

761
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:45,699
Yeah. Come here.

762
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:50,699
Take a look at this section.
It seems to be talking about time.

763
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:53,699
You see the symbol of "time" - everywhere.

764
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,700
So what is this?

765
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:59,699
A formula for faster than light travel?

766
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,700
Who can tell?

767
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:05,699
It has too many gaps.
Its not complete.

768
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:06,700
Then it dawned on me.

769
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,700
Right here.

770
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:14,699
Stop focussing on the "1"s.
Look at the "0"s.

771
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:18,700
How much of it is data and
how much of it is negative space?

772
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:21,700
So I measured it.

773
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:26,700
0.0833 recurring.

774
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:33,700
Perhaps you'd like to add
that as a fraction.

775
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:38,700
1/12.

776
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:45,699
What is saying right here, is that,
this is one of twelfth.

777
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:49,699
- We are part of a larger hole.
- Or 1 of 12 contestants for the prize.

778
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:51,699
- Why do we have to talk to him?
- We all working together here.

779
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:54,188
We need to talk to the other
sites, We need to help

780
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,699
them with what they got
from the other Hept치podes.

781
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,699
In case you don't remember,
we're blacked out.

782
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:01,699
China just threatened to destroy
their Shell. We are on our own.

783
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:03,699
But it says that all the pieces fit in.

784
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:05,700
And I'm telling you that no one else cares.

785
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,699
Two hours ago we pulled this audio off
a secured channel in Russia.

786
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:12,700
Someone from their science team
was broadcasting live.

787
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:17,699
In their final session,
the alien said:

788
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:20,700
"There's no time. Many become one..."

789
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,699
I feel we have all the given weapons.

790
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,700
If anyone is receiving this...

791
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:27,700
Please...

792
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:34,700
Well, I mean...

793
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:38,699
There are a lot of ways you can
interpret what he said.

794
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:40,699
I don't need an interpreter to
know what this means.

795
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:44,699
Russia just executed one of their own
experts to keep their secret.

796
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:46,699
"Many become one"
can be their way of saying

797
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:48,699
Some only required.

798
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,699
Why hand it out to us in pieces?
Why not give it all?

799
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:54,700
What better way to force us
to work together for once?

800
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:56,700
Even if I did believe you,

801
01:23:56,701 --> 01:23:58,688
How in the world are you
going to get anyone

802
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,700
else to play along, and
give out their data?

803
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:03,700
- We offer ours in return.
- Yeah?

804
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:08,700
- What, trade?
- Its a non zero sum game.

805
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:13,700
Non zero sum game.

806
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:17,700
Thats it. Thanks.

807
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:28,699
9 local completely isolated.

808
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,771
Only way to reach them is
to physically drive and

809
01:24:30,783 --> 01:24:32,699
yell at the border guards
which we are doing.

810
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:33,700
But it won't be fast enough.

811
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:36,699
There must be a way to get the message.

812
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:39,699
To our allies, maybe. But at this stage,
it's little too late.

813
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,699
What we need is to get all the
other nations online...

814
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:46,699
before we start a war and theres
no way for us to reach them

815
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:49,700
Wait. Hold on a second.
Louise.

816
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:51,700
Its right above us.

817
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,699
Thats problematic for us right now.

818
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:57,699
The Pentagon is convinced
that our Shell will retaliate.

819
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:00,700
I'd guess its orders say that we leave
within the hour.

820
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:04,699
Look they are not our enemy.
They meant no act of aggression towards us.

821
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,699
Maybe thats their way of being aggressive.

822
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:09,700
- Its not the question.
- Then what is the question?

823
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:14,699
How do we get you back in that room
thats half a mile straight up?

824
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:16,699
I think our work here is done.

825
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:19,700
Its in the hands of our superiors now.

826
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:41,700
What the hell is she doing?

827
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:00,700
Costello?

828
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:04,700
Where is Abbott?

829
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:17,700
"ABBOTT IS DEATH PROCESS"

830
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:35,700
I'm sorry.

831
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:39,700
We're sorry.

832
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:45,700
I need you to...

833
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:50,700
I need you to... to send a message...
to the other sites.

834

I don't understand. Who is this child?

844
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:18,700

- Dr. Banks!
- Louise!

849
01:32:46,701 --> 01:32:48,700
Are you alright?

850
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:53,699
- You alright?
- Yeah.

851
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:55,699
Come here.

852
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:56,700
I tried to understand. But they...

853
01:32:56,701 --> 01:32:59,699
It doesn't matter now.
We have orders to evacuate.

854
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:01,699
- Why?
- Russia and Sudan

855
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:02,700
will follow suit.

856
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:07,699
Ian... I do not understand why...?

857
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:09,699
Help me, Mama.

858
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:11,700
Louise...

859
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:13,700

Momma!

861
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:21,700
Sorry, honey.

862
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:27,699
What day is it, do you know baby?

863
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:28,700
Sunday.

864
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:36,700
Are you gonna leave me like Daddy did?

865
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:40,700
Oh, Hannah, honey,
your daddy didn't leave you.

866
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:43,700
You're gonna see him... this weekend.

867
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:47,700
He never look me anymore.

868
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:56,700
Its my fault.

869
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:03,700
I told him something that
he wasn't ready to hear.

870
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:06,700
What?

871
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:09,700
Well...

872
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:12,699
Believe it or not...

873
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:15,700
I know something thats going to happen.

874
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:20,700
I can not explain how I know it,
I just do.

875
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:24,700
And when I told your daddy, he
got really mad.

876
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:29,700
He said I made the wrong choice.

877
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:34,700
What? Whats going to happen?

878
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:39,699
It has to do with a...

879
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:41,700
A very rare disease.

880
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:46,700
And its unstoppable.

881
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:50,700
Kind of like you are.

882
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:52,700
You're so amazing

883
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:57,700
And your poetry and all the other amazing
things that you share with the world.

884
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:02,700
- I'm unstoppable?
- Yeah.

885
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:20,700
I got you...

886
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:23,700
I got you.

887
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:25,700
Louise.

888
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:29,699
I just realized why my husband left me.

889
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:31,699
My husband left me.

890
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:33,700
You have been married?

891
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:35,700
Let's get out of here.

892
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:12,699
- Mamma.
- Yeah?

893
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:14,700
Why my name is Hannah?

894
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:23,699
Your name is very special.

895
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:25,699
Because it is a palindrome.

896
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:29,700
It reads the same word from backwards.

897
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:35,700
- Turn it off.
- That goes back.

We're done here.

01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:37,700
I can read it.

906
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:43,699
- I know what it is.
- What?

907
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:46,699
It's not a weapon. It's a gift.

908
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:48,699
The weapon is their language.

909
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:50,699
They gave it all to us.

910
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:53,699
So we can learn Hept치pode?

911
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:56,699
If you learn it... really learn it,

912
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:59,699
you get to perceive time the way they do.

913
01:37:59,700 --> 01:38:01,699
So you get to see whats to happen.

914
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:04,699
But time, it isn't the same for them.

915
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:06,699
- It is not linear.
- Look...

916
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:09,700
We did our best but it wasn't enough.

to work with you.

01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:20,700
Good luck.

921
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:33,700
I'll find out where we are going.

01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:43,700
Wake up, Mummy.

923
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:21,700
Dr. Banks...

924
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:23,700
Its a pleasure.

925
01:39:23,701 --> 01:39:27,699
General Shang, the pleasure is mine.

926
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:29,699
Your president said...

927
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:33,699
It was an honor to host me in celebration.

928
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:35,699
- Of course.
- I confess...

929
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:39,700
The only reason why I am here is...

930
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:42,700
To meet you in person.

931
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:46,699
Well, Im flattered. Thank you.

932
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:50,700
18 months ago, you did
something remarkable.

933
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:55,700
Something not even my superior has done.

934
01:39:57,700 --> 01:40:00,700
- What's that?
- You changed my mind.

935
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:06,700
You are the reason for this unification.

936
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:10,700
All because you reached out to
me on my private number.

937
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:16,700
Your private number? General I do
not know your private number...

938
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:25,700
Now you know.

939
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:31,700
I claimed to know how your mind works,
but...

940
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:35,700
I believe it was important
for you to see that.

941
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:39,700
I called you tonight?

942
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:41,700
Yes, you did.

943
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:55,700
Louise...

944
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:13,699
Alright, let's shut down the system.

945
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:17,700
Sir... there's a satelite
here dialling China.

946
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:21,700
Here? What do you mean here?

947
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:25,700
Come on, answer.

948
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:28,700
Whose phone is it?

949
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:34,700
It's your phone, sir.

950
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:42,699
Search base camp now.

951
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:45,699
Find out who is using that phone.

952
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:47,699
- Hold on to those co-ordinates.
- Yes sir.

953
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:50,700
C'mon... What am I saying?

954
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:52,700
What am I saying?

955
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:55,700
Okay.

956
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:04,700
Okay.

957
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:08,700
I never forget what you said.

958
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:22,700
You told me my wife's dying words.

959
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:41,700
We found the source of the phone call.

960
01:42:41,701 --> 01:42:44,700
It is in decontamination.
Waiting for instructions.

961
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:47,700
Louise... What are you doing?

962
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:50,699
- What are you doing?
- Changing his opinion.

963
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:52,699
Buy us 20 seconds.

964
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:54,699
- We do not have time.
- Trust me.

965
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:57,699
- 20 seconds. Do you trust me?
- Now? It's all right.

966
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:59,700
Dr. Banks...

967
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:03,700
Drop the phone, or we shoot.

968
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:09,700
- Drop it!
- Im sorry!

969
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:13,700
This is an act of treason!

970
01:43:19,700 --> 01:43:21,699
- Drop it!
- Its done.

971
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:23,700
I got it.

972
01:43:37,700 --> 01:43:40,699
The communications blackout
from all 12 landing sites...

973
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:43,699
continues this evening...

974
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:46,699
Hold on... We are just hearing.

975
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:48,938
We are going to cut
this report to tell you.

976
01:43:48,950 --> 01:43:49,700
Latest news.

977
01:43:49,701 --> 01:43:51,699
China has called an emergency
press conference...

978
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:54,699
General Shang, chief of the
People's Liberation Army...

979
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:58,699
Has announced in an emergency press
conference that China is standing down.

980
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:01,220
China is stating that all the intelligence
they have received...

981
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:04,699
Will be shared immediately...

982
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:07,699
The world is entering a new era...

983
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:10,699
The Russian army are now revealing

984
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:14,700
information they acquired
from both their landing sites...

985
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:10,700
So, Hannah...

986
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:13,700
This is where your story begins.

987
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:17,700
The day they departed.

988
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:23,700
Are you alright?

989
01:46:26,700 --> 01:46:29,699
Despite knowing the journey...

990
01:46:29,700 --> 01:46:31,700
and where it leads...

991
01:46:33,700 --> 01:46:35,700
I embrace it.

992
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:41,700
And I welcome every moment of it.

993
01:46:56,700 --> 01:47:00,700
H-A-N-N-A-H.

994
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:16,699
Now backwards.

995
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:20,699
H-A-N-N-A-H.

996
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:22,700
Hannah.

997
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:27,700
You ready, baby?

998
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:31,699
- Hey.
- Hey.

999
01:47:31,700 --> 01:47:32,860
- It's okay?
- Yes you can go.

1000
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:35,700
Daddy!

1001
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:47,700
Are you ok?
I'll just roll over you.

1002
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:52,700
Are you ready?

1003
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:58,700
Guess what... All star stuff.

1004
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:02,699
- Ian.
- Yeah.

1005
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:04,700
If you see your whole life,
from start to finish...

1006
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:10,700
Would you change things?

1007
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:18,700
Maybe I...

1008
01:48:19,700 --> 01:48:22,700
I say what I feel more often. I don't know.

1009
01:48:38,700 --> 01:48:40,699
I've had my head tilted up to the stars

1010
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:42,700
for as long as I can remember.

1011
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:47,700
But you know what surprised me?

1012
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:51,700
It was not meeting them.

1013
01:48:56,700 --> 01:48:57,700
It was meeting you.

1014
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:41,700
I'd forgotten how good it felt
to be held by you.

1015
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:52,780
Do you want to make a baby?

1016
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:30,700
Yes... yeah!
