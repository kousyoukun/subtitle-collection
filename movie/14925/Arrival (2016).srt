00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:02,193
and they met the Aboriginal people.

516
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:03,778

the animals that hop around

518

520
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:11,368

the difference between

a specific "you" and a collective "you,"

572

do they make conscious choices?

577
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:12,591
Or is their motivation so instinctive

578
00:43:12,675 --> 00:43:15,719
that they don't understand
a "why" question at all?

And... And biggest of all,

we need to have enough

1433
01:48:41,933 --> 01:48:43,518
for as long as I can remember.

1434
01:48:46,021 --> 01:48:48,565
You know what surprised me the most?

1435
01:48:50,358 --> 01:48:52,444
It wasn't meeting them.

1436
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:59,451
It was meeting you.

1437
01:49:39,449 --> 01:49:43,286
I forgot how good it felt to be held by you.

1438
01:49:52,337 --> 01:49:54,339
IAN: You wanna make a baby?

1439
01:50:28,581 --> 01:50:31,209
LOUISE: Yes. Yeah.
