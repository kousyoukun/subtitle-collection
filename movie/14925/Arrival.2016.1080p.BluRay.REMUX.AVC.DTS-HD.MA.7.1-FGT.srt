1
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,360
我曾以为这就是你故事的起点
I used to think this was the beginning of your story.

2
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,680
记忆这东西作风诡异
Memory is a strange thing.

3
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,680
总是让我琢磨不透
It doesn't work like I thought it did.

4
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,880
我们完全受制于时间
We are so bound by time,

5
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,920
要跟随它的节拍
by its order.

6
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,560
好了
Okay.

7
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,400
好了，回到妈妈身边吧
Okay, come back to me.

8
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,130
到妈妈怀里来
Come back to me.

9
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,080
到妈妈怀里来
Come back to me.

10
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,570
举起手来！
Stick 'em up!

11
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,320
你就是这镇上的警长吗？
Are you the sheriff in this here town?

12
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,730
我拿着挠痒枪，现在要来收拾你了
These are my tickle guns, and I'm gonna get ya.

13
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,480
不要
No.

14
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,960
你想让我去抓你？那你快点逃吧
You want me to chase you? You better run.

15
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,920
我记得故事中间的片段
I remember moments in the middle.

16
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,770
我爱你
I love you.

17
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,000
我恨你！
I hate you!

18
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,010
这就是终点了
And this was the end.

19
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,480
回到妈妈身边
Come back to me.

20
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,760
回到妈妈身边好吗
Come back to me.

21
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,840
可现在，我有点不相信起点和终点了
But now I'm not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings.

22
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,000
一些和你人生并无交集的日子，却勾勒出你的故事
There are days that define your story beyond your life.

23
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,640
就好像他们降临的那天
Like the day they arrived.

24
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
早上好
Good morning.

25
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,680
- 早上好  - 早上好
- Morning.  - Morning.

26
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,770
怎么就你们几个？
Where is everyone?

27
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,880
好吧，我们上课吧
Okay. Well, let's get started.

28
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,680
今天我们谈下葡萄牙语
Today, we are talking about Portuguese

29
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,850
为什么它的发音和其他罗马语系有较大差别
and why it sounds so different from the other Romance languages.

30
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,530
葡萄牙语发源于加利西亚王国
The story of Portuguese begins in the kingdom of Galicia...

31
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,440
- 抱歉   - 中世纪时期
- Sorry.  - ...in the Middle Ages,

32
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,490
语言被视为一种艺术表达方式
where language was seen as an expression of art.

33
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,210
你有什么新闻想分享吗？
Any news you wanna share?

34
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,120
班克斯博士，你能打开电视机，调到新闻频道吗？
Dr. Banks, can you turn the TV to a news channel?

35
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,560
...来到现场
...arrived here on scene,

36
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,720
警察已经在周边区域设置了路障
but police have already set up a blockade here around the area.

37
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,320
你可以看到，我们已经是尽可能接近了
As you can see, we've gotten just about as close as we can,

38
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,720
可遗憾的是，蒙大拿现在已经完全封锁了
but unfortunately, Montana, right now, is on complete lockdown.

39
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,320
40分钟前，不明物体确认着陆在94号州际公路北面
The object apparently touched down 40 minutes ago just north of I-94.

40
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,760
我们正等候消息，看这是不是艘实验飞船，又或者...
We're waiting to hear if this is perhaps an experimental vessel or...

41
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,240
等下...
Hold on.

42
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,590
我刚得知，还有更多的这类物体
I'm learning that more objects like this have landed

43
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:54,280
在全球范围内的最少8处地点着陆
at as many as eight other locations around the world.

44
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,640
好，我们可以播？
Yes. Can we?

45
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,760
这是北海道某地
This is from a site in Hokkaido.

46
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,080
这是此时此刻正在全球发生的事件
This is worldwide. It is happening right now.

47
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,790
好吧
Okay.

48
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,560
就到这...  下课了
That's... Class is dismissed.

49
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,240
目前我们只请求大家的配合
For now, we're simply asking for cooperation

50
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,600
等候官方对此物体进行评估
while authorities assess the object.

51
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,280
那你就是说它不是我们国家的？
So, you're saying it's not ours?

52
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,770
你根本不知道它是否来自地球吧？
Do you even know if it's from Earth?

53
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,120
我们正在收集消息，和其他国家协调
We're still collecting information. We're coordinating with other countries.

54
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,440
不只是我们的后院里冒出这么个东西
We are not the only ones to have one of these in our backyard.

55
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,360
如果这是某种寻求和平的第一类接触
If this is some sort of peaceful first contact,

56
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,280
为什么要来12艘
why send 12?

57
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,120
一艘就够了吧
Why not just one?

58
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,640
嗯，我知道，我也看到了
Yeah, I know. I saw that, too.

59
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,320
我不知道，老妈，我跟你看的新闻都一样
I don't know, Mom. I'm watching the same news coverage you are.

60
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,400
老妈啊，别听那个台胡扯
Well, Mom, please don't bother with that channel.

61
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,720
那些人都是白痴，我提醒过你多少次了？
How many times do I have to tell you those people are idiots?

62
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,040
我哪紧张了？
Yeah, well, do I sound nervous?

63
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,960
就是，所以嘛...
Okay, exactly. So...

64
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,840
我？你了解我的，我还不是老样子
Me? Yeah. You know me, I'm about the same.

65
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,250
老妈，我没事
Mom, I'm fine.

66
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,760
好，我会再打给你的，再见
Okay, I'll call you later. Bye.

67
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,850
着陆到现在有差不多8小时了
And at around eight hours after landing,

68
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,080
仍旧没有任何"第一类接触"的迹象
there are still no signs of what might be called "first contact."

69
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,000
不明物体最少有457米高
Now, the objects measure at least 1, 500 feet tall.

70
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,810
据报道，还有2艘不明物体进入俄罗斯领空
Two are reported to have penetrated Russian airspace,

71
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,360
一艘在西伯利亚，另一艘在黑海沿岸
one in Siberia and the other off the coast of the Black...

72
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,850
矗立在海面上
...suspended above the ocean.

73
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,720
目前总计有12艘不明物体降落在全球各地
So far, there are 12 unidentified objects spread across the globe.

74
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,530
它们的降落地点并无明显关联
There is no obvious logic to their locations

75
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,160
没有证据表明这些飞船是...
and no evidence that the ships are even...

76
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,680
如果它的确是某种飞船，也不能排除
...who entertain the idea that if it is a kind of vessel,

77
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,480
它是无人驾驶的可能
it may be unmanned.

78
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,000
不管怎样，我们有应对此类事件的一套方案
Regardless, we have a protocol for scenarios like this, but...

79
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,590
委内瑞拉现场

80
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,040
在经历了不同寻常的周二后
After Tuesday's extraordinary events,

81
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,040
总统今早宣布全国进入紧急状态
the President, this morning, has declared a state of emergency,

82
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,880
仅蒙大拿州，就有约五千名
with as many as 5, 000 National Guard being deployed

83
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,800
国民警卫队进驻
to the state of Montana alone.

84
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,960
边境关闭，航班停飞
Borders are closed and flights have been grounded,

85
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,800
上百万旅客滞留机场
stranding millions of travelers.

86
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,440
人们疯狂抢购汽油，瓶装水和食物
Panic buying of gas, water, and food continues to escalate

87
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,640
联邦政府暂时解除了
and federal authorities have temporarily lifted all caps

88
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,960
对执法部门的加班禁令
on overtime for law enforcement.

89
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,480
烟酒枪械管理署已暂停发放新的持枪许可
The ATF has put a temporary ban on new gun licenses,

90
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,400
迫使许多独立供应商抢购各类武器装备
forcing many independent suppliers of hunting equipment and firearms

91
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
并把公众拒之门外
to close their doors to the public.

92
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,320
48小时过去了，在12个UFO着陆点
Forty-eight hours later and no further development...

93
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,440
才2天
Two days.

94
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,930
仍未有新的进展
...from the sight of the 12 UFO...

95
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,600
公众就已经指望我们能解答一切了
And already the public expects us to know the answers.

96
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,920
我是GT韦伯上校
I'm Colonel G.T. Weber.

97
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,280
我们没有正式见过面
We never formally met,

98
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,000
不过2年前，你给情报部门做过波斯语翻译吧？
but two years ago, you did some Farsi translations for Army intelligence.

99
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,520
那些叛军视频的翻译工作你干得很利索
You made quick work of those insurgent videos.

100
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,760
你跟那些叛军打交道也很利索啊
You made quick work of those insurgents.

101
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,040
不管是谁推荐翻译专家，都会把你排在最前面
You are on the top of everyone's list when it comes to translations.

102
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,360
而且你的单一范畴背景调查2年后才失效
And you have another two years in the SSBI.

103
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,440
所以你仍有接触核心机密的许可
So, you still have top-secret clearance.

104
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,160
这也是我选择来你办公室，而不是伯克利的原因
That's why I'm in your office and not at Berkeley.

105
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,240
好吧
Okay.

106
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,040
我有东西想请你翻译
I have something I need you to translate for me.

107
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,160
你们为何而来？
Why are you here?

108
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,800
你们听得懂我们的话吗？
Can you... Can you understand us?

109
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,850
你们来自何方？
Where did you come from?

110
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,410
你现在听过了
Now you heard it.

111
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,760
有什么想法吗？
What do you make of it?

112
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,330
那就是...
Is that...

113
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,280
是的
Yes.

114
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,760
有几个？
How many?

115
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,850
什么几个？
How many what?

116
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,600
说话的有几个？
How many speaking?

117
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,600
2个
Two.

118
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,640
假设他们不是同时开口
Assume they were not speaking at the same time.

119
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,560
你能肯定？他们有嘴吗？
Are you sure? Did they have mouths...

120
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,530
你会如何来翻译这个？
How would you approach translating this?

121
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,530
你能分辨出词语
Do you hear any words?

122
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,320
或者句子吗？
Phrases?

123
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,200
我，我不知道
I don't... I don't know.

124
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,050
那你能告诉我什么？
So, what can you tell me?

125
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,290
我能告诉你的是，仅凭一个音频文件是做不出翻译的
I can tell you that it's impossible to translate from an audio file.

126
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,960
我得亲历现场与他们交谈
I would need to be there to interact with them.

127
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,720
你翻译波斯语时也没在现场啊
You didn't need that with the Farsi translations.

128
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,640
那是因为我已经掌握了波斯语
I didn't need it because I already knew the language.

129
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,760
而这个...
But this, this is...

130
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,400
我知道你打的什么主意
I know what you're doing.

131
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,960
- 揭穿我啊  - 我不会带你去蒙大拿
- Tell me what I'm doing.  - I'm not taking you to Montana.

132
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,280
能接触核心机密的人多了，我不会让那变成
It's all I can do to keep it from turning into a tourist site

133
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,320
你们的旅游景点
for everybody who has a TS clearance.

134
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,400
我只是跟你讲明如何才能做好这份工作
I'm just telling you what it would take to do this job.

135
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,160
我不是来跟你讨价还价的
This is not a negotiation.

136
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,200
我出了这个门，你的机会就没了
If I leave here, your chance is gone.

137
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,520
再见
Good day.

138
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,600
上校
Colonel?

139
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,680
你刚提到了伯克利，你接下来要找丹弗斯吧？
You mentioned Berkeley, are you going to ask Danvers next?

140
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760
可能吧
Maybe.

141
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,360
在你邀请他前
Before you commit to him,

142
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,840
问他梵文里的“战争”一词，以及翻译过来的意思
ask him the Sanskrit word for "war" and its translation.

143
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,640
在中国和俄罗斯加入联合国的磋商后
An agreement on sharing scientific discoveries looks closer tonight,

144
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,800
有望就共享科学发现达成协议
as Russia and China join talks at the United Nations.

145
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,880
以此同时，全球金融市场陷入危机
Meanwhile, financial markets across the world are in crisis

146
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,800
道琼斯工业指数狂泻2000点
as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 2,000 points

147
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,280
打破了一周跌幅的历史记录
in its worst weekly decline in history.

148
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,240
早上好
Mornin'.

149
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,440
上校
Colonel.

150
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,490
“加维什提” 他说是争论的意思
Gavisti. He says it means "an argument."

151
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,640
你的标准答案是？
What do you say it means?

152
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,480
寻找更多的牛
"A desire for more cows."

153
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,560
收拾好背包
Pack your bags.

154
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,360
好的，给我20分钟
All right, give me 20 minutes?

155
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,770
我们10分钟后起飞
We take off in 10.

156
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,480
班克斯博士，请跟我来
Dr. Banks. Right this way, please.

157
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,520
准备起飞
Contact and ready to approach...

158
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,080
不好意思，班克斯博士，让我检查下你的安全带
Excuse me, Dr. Banks, let me make sure you're properly secured.

159
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,600
你没事吧
You okay?

160
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,840
谢谢
Thanks.

161
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,960
抱歉，刚才听不清你说了什么
Sorry, I couldn't hear what you were saying.

162
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,610
语言是文明的基石
"Language is the foundation of civilization.

163
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,280
是把人们聚到一起的粘合剂
"It is the glue that holds a people together.

164
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,720
也是冲突中最先使用的武器
"It is the first weapon drawn in a conflict."

165
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,760
路易丝，这位是伊恩・唐纳利
Louise, this is Ian Donnelly.

166
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,490
路易丝・班克斯，伊恩・唐纳利
Louise Banks, Ian Donnelly.

167
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,600
这个见面礼不错嘛
It's quite a greeting.

168
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,240
是啊，你的大作
Yeah. Well, you wrote it.

169
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,760
嗯，不过
Yeah, but...

170
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,600
序言都是这么写的
It's the kind of thing you write as a preface,

171
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,600
言简意赅，博取眼球
dazzle them with the basics.

172
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,570
话是漂亮
Yeah. It's great.

173
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,920
可惜说错了
Even if it's wrong.

174
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,200
错了？
It's wrong?

175
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,800
文明的基石并不是语言，而是科学
Well, the cornerstone of civilization isn't language, it's science.

176
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,200
伊恩是阿拉莫斯国家实验室的理论物理学家
Ian is a theoretical physicist from Los Alamos.

177
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,520
你向我汇报工作，不过在“蛋壳”里时，你会和他搭配工作
You'll be reporting to me, but you'll be working with him when you're in the shell.

178
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,680
他们是这样叫不明飞行物的？
That's what they're calling the UFO.

179
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,280
首要任务，搞清他们来自何方，来这里的目的
Priority one. What do they want, where are they from.

180
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,680
除此之外，他们是如何过来的
And beyond that, how did they get here?

181
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,200
他们掌握了超光速旅行吗？
Are they capable of faster-than-light travel?

182
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,320
他们...
Are they...

183
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,840
我专门列了个问题的单子，可以跟你说下
I have a list of questions that, you know, we can go over.

184
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,490
先用二进制序列来欢迎他们
Starting with a series of just a "handshake" of binary sequences...

185
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,050
先别急着问他们各种数学问题
How about we just talk to them

186
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,240
我们从简单交流开始，好吗？
before we start throwing math problems at them?

187
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,600
这正是要你们两个的原因
This is why you're both here.

188
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,290
我负责端咖啡
I'll bring the coffee.

189
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,400
跟外星人一起喝咖啡
Coffee with some aliens.

190
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,920
带他们两个去凯特勒博士那
All right. I want you to take these two to Dr. Kettler.

191
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,040
遵命，长官
Yes, sir.

192
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,640
跟这位上尉去医务室
Follow the captain to Medical.

193
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,600
要花几分钟走下程序，之后我们就开工了
The procedure should take just a few minutes, and then, we'll get started.

194
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,360
背包就交给他们保管吧
These men are gonna take care of your bags.

195
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,640
手机交给我
I'll take your cell phones.

196
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,440
手机
Cell phones.

197
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
跟我来
Follow me.

198
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,840
带上这个，任何时候都别取
Put these on. You're gonna wear them at all times.

199
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,200
- 他们来了再说  - 很好
- Not until they're here.  - Great.

200
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,080
长官，他们来了
Sir, they're here.

201
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,840
路易丝・班克斯，伊恩・唐纳利
Louise Banks? Ian Donnelly?

202
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,480
你们上一次用餐是什么时候？
When was the last time either of you have eaten?

203
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,240
- 昨晚  - 我也一样
- Last night.  - Same.

204
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,760
你们上一次做有精神压力的事，是什么时候？
When's the last time you did something stressful?

205
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,480
现在算吗？
Does now count?

206
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,400
说说而已
Just saying.

207
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,240
刚刚被抬进救伤直升机的是谁？
Who was being carted off in the medevac?

208
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,130
不是每个人都能承受这种经历
Not everyone is able to process experiences like this.

209
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,040
我需要给你们抽点血
I'm gonna get some blood from you

210
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,480
然后再给你们打一针疫苗，来抵御各类细菌威胁
and give you an immunization dose that covers a battery of bacterial threats.

211
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,920
你们能签下这个吗？
Would you sign these, please?

212
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,240
请把袖子卷起来
And roll up your sleeves.

213
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,480
你们都没有幽闭恐惧症吧？
Either of you claustrophobic?

214
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,890
- 没有  - 没
- Nope.  - No.

215
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,040
有在服用什么药吗？对什么过敏吗？怀孕呢？
Currently taking any medications? Allergies? Pregnant?

216
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,760
没有
No.

217
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,800
加强剂的药效明显
The booster is a kick to your system,

218
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,600
所以你们可能会有不良反应
so you may experience some side-effects,

219
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,760
诸如恶心，头晕，头疼
nausea, dizziness, headaches,

220
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,320
或者耳鸣之类的
a ringing in your ears like you have tinnitus.

221
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,450
你知道他怎么了吗？
You see what's happening to him?

222
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,800
这个怎么可能？
How does this even work?

223
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,800
读数并无变化，不过...
The readings do not change, but...

224
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,280
我也搞不懂，我们像是爬在纸上的昆虫
I don't know. It's like we're insects on a piece of paper

225
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,040
然后他们让我们自己滚蛋
and they're easing us out of the house.

226
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,120
在112分钟19秒后
At exactly 112 minutes and 19 seconds,

227
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,640
重力开始回升，让我们慢慢滑出房间
the gravity starts to shift and slides us out of the room.

228
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,610
对此你能做出科学上的解释吗？
Have you found a scientific explanation for it?

229
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
比如这个变化是为了他们自己？
Like, is it for them?

230
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,000
不，我觉得是照顾我们
No, we think it's for us.

231
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,800
似乎房间内的空气并不流通
The air doesn't seem to circulate inside the chamber,

232
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,800
所以顶多两小时，氧气就耗尽了
so after about two hours, you run out of oxygen.

233
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,320
那输送新鲜空气进房间，18个小时还不够吗？
It doesn't take 18 hours to pump fresh air into a room.

234
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,520
大气
Atmosphere.

235
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,640
你说什么？
Excuse me?

236
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,160
如果他们的大气和地球上的不同
If their atmosphere is different from Earth,

237
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,680
那他们每次打开大门前
it would certainly take hours

238
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,960
就肯定需要数小时来制造适宜氧气浓度和压力来照顾我们
to rebalance the O2 content and pressure for us every time they open their door.

239
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,400
照你这么说，他们随时都可以闷死我们？
So, you're saying they could suffocate us if they wanted?

240
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,400
这位是大卫・哈尔彭，中情局的特工
This is Agent David Halpern with the CIA.

241
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,160
跟我去你们的工作地点吧
Let me get you two to your stations.

242
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,200
好的
Yes, sir.

243
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,800
记住，我们必须尽快搞清这些问题
Remember, we need answers as soon as possible.

244
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,000
他们来做什么，他们来自何方，他们来这的目的
What do they want, where are they from, why they're here.

245
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,520
- 这是首先要解决的  - 好
- This is the priority.  - Yeah.

246
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,520
大家，这位是伊恩・唐纳利博士，他负责带你们队
Everyone, this is Dr. Ian Donnelly. He'll be running this team here.

247
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,800
他们有对什么做出回应吗
Yeah, have they responded to anything?

248
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,360
形状，模式，数字，斐波那契数列？
Shapes, patterns, numbers, Fibonacci?

249
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,520
我们并不懂他们说的话，不过他们对“你好”有回应
We can't tell what they are saying when they respond to "hello,"

250
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,600
别急于求成就行
so don't get ahead of yourself.

251
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,960
你现在有收获吗？
What have you figured out?

252
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,120
我们才刚开始而已
We're just getting started.

253
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,320
- 早上好各位  - 早上好
- Good morning.  - Good morning.

254
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,120
这位是路易丝・班克斯博士
This is Dr. Louise Banks.

255
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,240
她负责带你们队
She'll be heading your team.

256
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,080
- 班克斯博士，很荣幸  - 你好
- Dr. Banks. It's a pleasure meeting you.  - Hi.

257
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,320
班克斯博士会接手沃勒博士的工作
Dr. Banks is taking over the mission from Dr. Walker.

258
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,320
- 很高兴见面  - 班克斯博士，很高兴你能来
- Nice to see you.  - Dr. Banks, glad to see you.

259
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,440
这是15分钟警报
That's your 15-minute warning.

260
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,560
你以前潜过水吗？
You scuba-dive before?

261
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,760
我们要进入何种辐射环境？
What kind of radiation exposure are we walking into?

262
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,880
正常水平，这些只是以防万一
Nominal, these are just for safety.

263
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,000
如果有任何身体接触
So, is there any physical contact with the...

264
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,120
有谁跟我一样讲不出“外星人”吗？
Am I the only one having trouble saying "aliens"?

265
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,010
有堵墙，玻璃状的，你没法接近他们
There's a wall, like a glass wall. You can't get to them.

266
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,320
那他们长啥样的？
So, what do they look like?

267
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,520
你马上就知道了，动作快点吧
You'll see soon enough. Hurry up.

268
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,120
谢谢，请走这边

That's incredible.

406
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880
人类
Human.

407
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,520
人类
Human.

408
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
人类
Human.

409
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,840
很好
Okay.

410
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,530
很好... 慢点啊，伙计
Okay, slow down, fellas.

411
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,520
慢点
Slow down.

412
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,400
我不是想否认你取得的成果
I don't wanna take away from your success in there,

413
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,960
班克斯博士，就只有这一招了吗？
but, Dr. Banks, is this really the right approach?

414
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,880
交他们读书认字？
Trying to teach 'em how to speak and read?

415
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,120
这得花多久啊
That's gotta take longer.

416
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,770
你不懂，这会事半功倍的
You're wrong. It's faster.

417
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,320
你在这里做的每件事，我都要给一屋子的人解释
Everything you do in there I have to explain to a room full of men

418
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,520
而他们只关心一个问题：“这会给我们带来怎样的麻烦”
whose first and last question is, "How can this be used against us?"

419
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,480
所以你得给我令人信服的理由
So, you're gonna have to give me more than that.

420
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,370
袋鼠
Kangaroo.

421
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,850
什么意思？
What is that?

422
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,330
1770年
In 1770,

423
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,720
船长詹姆斯・库克的船只在澳大利亚沿岸搁浅
Captain James Cook's ship ran aground off the coast of Australia,

424
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,400
他带队登陆，并见到了当地的土著
and he led a party into the country and they met the Aboriginal people.

425
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,520
其中一位水手指着把幼崽装在兜里
One of the sailors pointed at the animals that hop around

426
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,360
在地上蹦来蹦去的动物
and put their babies in their pouch,

427
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,250
问它们叫什么，土著回答“Kanguru”
and he asked what they were, and the Aborigines said, "Kanguru."

428
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,360
你想表明什么？
And the point is?

429
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,520
很久以后他们才搞懂“Kanguru”的意思是“我听不懂”
It wasn't until later that they learned that "kanguru" means "I don't understand."

430
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,240
所以，我在房间里用这个是为了化解误会
So, I need this so that we don't misinterpret things in there,

431
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,160
不然得耗费10倍的时间
otherwise this is gonna take 10 times as long.

432
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,560
这理由勉强能交差
I could sell that for now.

433
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,720
下次对话前，你必须把要用的词
But I need you to submit your vocabulary words

434
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,880
拟个单子给我
before the next session.

435
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,480
好
Fair.

436
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,160
请别忘了土著人的遭遇
And remember what happened to the Aborigines.

437
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,800
一个更先进的种族差点令他们灭亡
A more advanced race nearly wiped 'em out.

438
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,320
你讲的故事不错
It's a good story.

439
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,520
谢谢
Thanks.

440
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,880
是杜撰的
It's not true.

441
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,800
但管用就行
But it proves my point.

442
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:09,990
人类？

443
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,320
我觉得我们能还原出
We think we were able to reproduce

444
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,000
一些素数序列给他们
some prime number sequences back at them.

445
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,240
也算是有收获
So, that's something.

446
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,360
祝贺你，学到鹦鹉的本事了
Well, congratulations. You're a parrot.

447
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,960
意义远不止如此，你个自大狂
Well, it's a lot more than that, you cheeky bastard.

448
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,960
装糊涂吗？他们似乎搞不懂我们的几何学
Don't you see? They can't seem to follow our algebra.

449
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,080
反而对高深点的，更有共鸣
But complex behaviors? That clicks.

450
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,330
这根本没道理啊，不是吗？
Well, that doesn't make any sense at all, does it?

451
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,720
问题是，不是每个人都认同我们和外星人开诚布公的做法
The problem is, not everyone shares our policy of being open with the aliens.

452
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,400
这位是尚将军
Have you met General Shang?

453
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,360
他主宰着局势走向
Call sign for him is "Big Domino."

454
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,840
不管尚做什么，最少也会有4个国家效仿
Whatever Shang does, at least four other nations will follow.

455
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,570
- 路易丝，我们今天休整一下  - 好
- Louise, you have to gain ground today.  - Okay.

456
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,210
- 你给我准备好词语单了吗？  - 准备好了
- You have a vocabulary list for me?  - I do.

457
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,240
你要教他们认识你和伊恩的名字？
You're gonna teach them your name and Ian's?

458
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,210
是的，他们有名字的话，也会教给我们
Yes, so that we can learn their names, if they have names,

459
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,400
然后再介绍代词
and then introduce pronouns later.

460
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,120
这些都是小学教的
These are all grade-school words.

461
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,800
吃，走
"Eat." "Walk."

462
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,480
给我解释下
Help me understand.

463
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,560
好
Okay.

464
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,480
别，别擦，别擦上面的
No, no, no, not the top!

465
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,800
“你们到访地球的目的？”

466
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,200
好，这就是你想问的，对吧？
Okay, this is where you wanna get to, right?

467
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,720
- 就是这个  - 好
- That is the question.  - Okay.

468
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,560
那我们首先要确定，他们懂得什么是“问题”
So, first we need to make sure that they understand what a question is.

469
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,240
本质是我们发起请求
Okay? The nature of a request for information

470
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,760
来获取信息
along with a response.

471
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,080
然后我们还得解释清楚
Then, we need to clarify

472
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,320
“你”跟“你们”有什么区别
the difference between a specific "you" and a collective "you,"

473
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,800
因为我们并不关心某个外星人被派来做什么
because we don't want to know why Joe Alien is here.

474
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,360
而是想搞清他们共同到访的目的
We want to know why they all landed.

475
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,080
而目的又需要懂得意图
And "purpose" requires an understanding of intent.

476
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,920
我们得搞清这是他们自觉的选择
We need to find out, do they make conscious choices

477
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,200
亦或是受本能驱使
or is their motivation so instinctive

478
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,360
以至于对提问根本不会有反应
that they don't understand a "why" question at all.

479
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,570
而重中之重，我们得跟他们建立起足够的词汇量
And... And biggest of all, we need to have enough vocabulary with them

480
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,640
能让我们明白他们的回答
that we understand their answer.

481
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,520
懂了
I get it.

482
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,240
遵照你的单子
Stick to your list.

483
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:32,640
千万...别乱加词进去
Just don't add anything to it.

484
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,520
重力0.97G，氧气浓度21.4%，完毕
Gravity, 0.97. Oxygen level, 21.4%. Over.

485
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,840
秃鹫，A队已就位
Condor, Alpha's now in the main.

486
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,320
正布置设备和遥测装置，完毕
Setting up equipment and telemetry. Over.

487
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,730
我们开始吧
Let's get started.

488
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,200
路易丝
"Louise."

489
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,080
路易丝，我叫路易丝
Louise. I am Louise.

490
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,650
那是什么？
What is that?

491
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,320
那是新符号吗？我分不清
Is that a new symbol? I can't tell.

492
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,320
不是吧，我觉得还是表示“人类”的符号
I don't know I think it's the symbol for "human" again.

493
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,680
只是收尾处略弯了点，或许这表示提问
It just has a little curl on the end, maybe to indicate a question.

494
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,920
我也不敢肯定
I don't know.

495
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,600
我也一样，路易丝
I don't know, Louise.

496
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,240
我觉得他们没明白
I think they're getting confused.

497
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,640
班克斯博士，我们继续下一个词吧
Dr. Banks, perhaps we should move on to the next word.

498
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,640
班克斯博士
Dr. Banks?

499
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,370
- 没事的  - 什么情况？
- It's okay, Nate.  - What's going on?

500
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,520
嘿，嘿，你在做什么？
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?

501
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,880
- 我没事  - 你疯了吗？
- Yeah, I'm fine.  - Are you insane?

502
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,200
得让他们见到我的真面目
They need to see me.

503
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,480
她要脱掉核生化防护服  班克斯博士！
She's taking off her hazmat suit. Dr. Banks!

504
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,040
你没事吧？
Is it okay?

505
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,480
你有感染的危险
You're risking contamination.

506
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,480
得让他们见到我的真面目
They need to see me.

507
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,560
班克斯博士
Dr. Banks.

508
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
班克斯博士
Dr. Banks.

509
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,120
她朝玻璃墙走去了
She's walking towards the screen.

510
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,880
要终止任务吗？
Should we abort?

511
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,560
请求收到，等候口头指令
Request noted. Stand by for frag order.

512
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,680
回到你们的位置
Go back to your stations.

513
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,640
这才算是正式见面
Now that's a proper introduction.

514
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,800
好了
Okay.

515
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,200
路易丝
"Louise."

516
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,090
我叫路易丝
I am Louise.

517
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,040
伊恩，你不介绍自己吗？
Ian, you want to introduce yourself?

518
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,080
好吧
Yeah.

519
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,440
路易丝
Louise.

520
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,160
豁出去了
Screw it.

521
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,450
人都有一死，对吧？
Everybody dies, right?

522
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,970
长官，唐纳利也脱掉了防护服
Sir, Donnelly is taking off his hazmat suit.

523
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,480
准许终止任务？
Permission to abort?

524
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,520
继续对话进程
Continue the session.

525
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,120
伊恩
Ian.

526
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,920
路易丝
Louise.

527
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,840
你呢？
You.

528
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,970
你们叫什么？
Who are you?

529
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,050
这应该是他们的名字
I think those are their names.

530
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,250
他们也有名字
They have names.

531
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,960
我们该如何称呼他们呢？
So, what are we gonna call them?

532
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,640
我不知道
I don't know.

533
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,070
我推荐阿波特和科斯特洛
I was thinking Abbott and Costello.

534
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:51,270
阿波特和科斯特洛是1940到1950年间好莱坞著名的喜剧搭档

535
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,280
好
Yeah.

536
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,560
- 好吗？  - 好，很好
- Yeah?  - Yeah, I like it.

537
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,240
很好
I like it.

538
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,120
一队人员，下车后
Team 1, exit your vehicle

539
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,360
直接前往污染物净化室
and proceed directly ahead to the decontamination tent.

540
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,090
在进入设备间前，请别取下你们的面具
Leave your respirator on until you reach the equipment room.

541
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,080
我知道
I know.

542
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:12,440
二队人员，下车后直接前往污染物净化室
Team 2, exit your vehicles and continue to the decontamination tent.

543
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,320
在进入设备间前
Leave your respirators on

544
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,520
千万别取下你们的面具
and do not hesitate until you reach the equipment room.

545
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,280
你感觉如何？
How do you feel?

546
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,720
疲劳过度
Overworked.

547
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,920
不用我多说你也明白，这样做有多危险
Well, I guess I don't need to tell you, you're putting yourself at risk.

548
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,920
并没有辐射中毒的迹象
There are no signs of radiation poisoning yet.

549
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,880
等你的血检出来后，我们再确认
We'll see how your blood tests look.

550
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,360
目前嘛，我再给你打一针加强剂
For now, I'm gonna give you another boost.

551
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,720
好
Okay.

552
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,360
没有辐射中毒
No radiation.

553
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,040
我们没查出任何异样
Nothing else we can detect either,

554
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,600
不过为了以防外一，我还是给他们打了加强剂
but I'd give 'em a strong cocktail regardless.

555
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,280
这是我们头一回取得实质进展
It's the first time we've made significant progress.

556
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,480
好吧
All right.

557
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,800
我们就冒这一回险
We'll take the risk.

558
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,280
- 宝贝  - 那边到底什么情况？
- Okay, honey...  - What is going on there?

559
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,880
- 宝贝  - 你一个字都不能透露？
- Honey.  - Is there anything you can tell me?

560
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,880
不能，你不用担心，好吗？
No... You don't need to worry, okay?

561
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,360
- 我怎么能不担心？  -冷静点
- How can I not worry?  - Just calm down.

562
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,520
冷静点
Just calm down.

563
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,480
贝基吵着问我，那些怪物会不会把爹地杀了
Becky asked me if the monsters are going to kill Daddy,

564
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,920
宝贝，那是不可能的
Honey, it's not gonna happen.

565
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,410
一定要注意安全
Just stay safe.

566
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,720
你不用担心
You don't need to worry.

567
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,680
请务必，我好害怕
Please, I'm so scared.

568
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:28,080
所有初级外星语言学家和科研人员必须遵守
All junior xenolinguistics and science personnel must observe

569
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,760
宵禁命令，除非有指挥官的特别授权
general curfew unless expressly authorized

570
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,520
可以进行加班工作
for extended work hours by unit COs.

571
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:37,200
宵禁每晚10点开始
Curfew in effect as of 2200 hours.

572
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,890
通知到所有晚班人员，消防人员，守夜人员
Notice to all late workers, fire watchers and night staff.

573
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:46,360
即刻生效，宵夜整晚供应
Effective immediately, midnight rations will be served all night.

574
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,480
我们仍然对七肢桶的许多方面一无所知
Here are some of the many things we don't know about heptapods.

575
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:42,000
hepta源自古希腊语，表示七，pod，表示脚
Greek. Hepta, "Seven. " Pod, "Foot."

576
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,400
七只脚，故称七肢桶
"Seven feet." Heptapod.

577
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,440
他们是何方神圣？
Who are they?

578
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,200
试图从任何有意义的角度来回答
Trying to answer thisin any meaningful way

579
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,960
都困难重重
is hampered by the fact that,

580
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,400
因为外界既看不到、也听不到他们
outside being able to see them and hear them,

581
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,600
七肢桶不留下任何蛛丝马迹
the heptapods leave absolutely no footprint.

582
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,680
他们宇宙飞船的化学组成仍未可知
The chemical composition of their spaceship is unknown.

583
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,810
“蛋壳”不产生废物，不排出气体，也没有辐射
The shell emits no waste, no gas, no radiation.

584
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,560
假设“蛋壳”之间有互有通讯
Assuming that the shells communicate with each other,

585
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,210
那他们手段高明，悄无声息
they do so without detection.

586
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:17,480
“蛋壳”内的空气不会被超声波或光波干扰
The air between the shells is untroubled by sonic emission or light wave.

587
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,170
他们是科学家，还是观光客？
Are they scientists or tourists?

588
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,600
他们是科学家的话，为什么提问并不积极
If they're scientists, they don't seem to ask a lot of questions.

589
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,560
他们为什么要停在现在的地方？
Why did they park where they did?

590
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,280
世界上最富盛名的专家也是一头雾水
The world's most decorated experts can't crack that one.

591
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,920
最受推崇的理论是，他们选择的地点都是
The most plausible theory is that they chose places on Earth

592
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,960
地球上闪电出现机率最低的
with the lowest incidence of lightning strikes.

593
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,640
可也有个别例外
But there are exceptions.

594
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,400
另一种候选理论是，这些地点都跟上世纪80年代
The next most plausible theory is that Sheena Easton had a hit song

595
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,320
席娜・伊斯顿：苏格兰著名歌星

596
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,520
席娜・伊斯顿的流行歌曲有关  所以... 我们只是瞎猜
at each of these sites in 1980. So, we just don't know.

597
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,440
他们之间如何交流？
How do they communicate?

598
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,480
路易丝的工作成果，令我们自惭形秽
Here, Louise is putting us all to shame.

599
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:01,720
我们取得的首个突破是发现七肢桶
The first breakthrough was to discover that there's no correlation

600
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,040
的书写和口语之间并无关联
between what a heptapod says and what a heptapod writes.

601
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:14,930
伊恩走路

602
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:25,840
不像任何人类文字，他们的书写是会意象形语标文字
Unlike all written human languages, their writing is semasiographic.

603
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,280
只传达意思，并无对应的发音
It conveys meaning. It doesn't represent sound.

604
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:38,360
或许我们的书写，在他们看来是多余的
Perhaps they view our form of writing as a wasted opportunity,

605
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,800
浪费了第二个交流渠道
passing up a second communications channel.

606
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,160
我们要感谢巴基斯坦的朋友
We have our friends in Pakistan

607
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,450
他们贡献了对七肢桶书写的研究
to thank for their study of how heptapods write.

608
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:56,730
因为和说话不同，语标不受时间限制
Because, unlike speech, a logogram is free of time.

609
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,840
与他们的飞船、身体相似
Like their ship or their bodies,

610
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,120
他们的书写文字不存在先后顺序
their written language has no forward or backward direction.

611
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,960
语言学家称之为非线性拼写
Linguists call this "nonlinear orthography,"

612
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,480
这不禁让人疑问：“他们也是这样思考的吗？”
which raises the question, "Is this how they think?"

613
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,280
想象你要用双手写一个句子
Imagine you wanted to write a sentence using two hands,

614
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,080
同时从2头开始
starting from either side.

615
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,760
你得想好要写的每一个字
You would have to know each word you wanted to use

616
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,720
以及它们占用的空间
as well as how much space that it would occupy.

617
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,760
而七肢桶在2秒内就能轻松写出
A heptapod can write a complex sentence

618
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,960
一个复杂的句子
in two seconds, effortlessly.

619
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,770
而我们做个最简单的回复，都要花上一个月
It's taken us a month to make the simplest reply.

620
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,240
下一步，扩充词汇量
Next, expanding vocabulary.

621
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,440
路易丝认为怎么都要花上一个月
Louise thinks it could easily take another month to be ready for that.

622
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,320
嘿
Hey.

623
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,880
嘿
Hey.

624
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,840
韦伯正找你呢
Weber's looking for you.

625
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,520
嗯，你以为我躲在这干嘛？
Yeah, well, why do you think I'm hiding out here?

626
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,240
上来啊
Come on up.

627
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,240
来
Come on.

628
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,400
谢谢
Thanks.

629
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,120
这地方不错吧？
Nice out here, huh?

630
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,800
嗯，风景不错
Yeah, it's a nice view.

631
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,280
远离喧嚣
Away from the noise.

632
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,760
其实，我刚好想到你
You know, I was just thinking about you.

633
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,560
你处理语言的方式挺像数学家
You approach language like a mathematician.

634
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,210
你自己也知道吧？
You know that, right?

635
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,360
我就当你是恭维我啊
I will take that as a compliment.

636
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:41,840
就是恭维
Yeah, well, it is.

637
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,440
多亏了你
It's...

638
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,210
我们才能避开那些沟通陷阱
I watch you steer us around these communication traps

639
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,240
不然我还蒙在鼓里
that I didn't even know existed.

640
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,600
说的什么啊
Say what?

641
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,000
我单身就是这个原因吧
I guess that's why I'm single.

642
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,280
不是打击你，懂得去沟通还不足以
Trust me, you can understand communication

643
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,080
让你脱单啊
and still end up single.

644
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,840
我总觉得那里面发生的一切
I feel like everything that happens in there

645
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,120
都和我们俩有关
comes down to the two of us.

646
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:21,200
这是好事，对吧？你和我？
Yeah, it's a good thing though, right? You and I?

647
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,680
整天和些废物一起工作，你也受不了吧？
Have you seen the jokers that we're working with?

648
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,320
能遇到你，真是老天有眼
I'm glad I got you.

649
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:36,310
外星人危机 第25天 委内瑞拉

650
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:39,230
外星人危机 第25天 塞拉利昂

651
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,070
伦敦  拯救我们的种族！

652
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,920
今晚，第一张外星人的照片开始疯传
Tonight, the first photograph of the aliens goes viral.

653
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,280
环保组织警告，蒙大拿存在的主要风险因子
Biological contamination is a major risk factor at the Montana site,

654
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,680
就是生化污染
so say environmental pressure groups.

655
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,840
在华盛顿，80万市民走上街头
Eight-hundred thousand march on Washington

656
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,570
抗议政府的危机应对
to protest the government's handling of the crisis.

657
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,240
别走开，还有更多的特别报道
All this, and more special coverage.

658
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,480
...有人在那东西里和外星人接触
First contact with whoever it is that is inside that thing,

659
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,440
猜猜是谁在导演？当然是政府啊
and who do we have running the show? The government.

660
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,480
没错，就是这个政府
That's right, folks. The same government

661
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,320
搞砸了我们的医疗保险，搞垮了我们的军队
who ruined our healthcare and bankrupted our military.

662
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,400
瞧瞧这些人
Look at these people.

663
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,360
他们大多数人连枪都没有
Most of them don't even have guns.

664
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,720
面对着可能的全面入侵
We could be facing a full-scale invasion,

665
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,720
我们的总统却一味忍让
and our president is just willing to sit back

666
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,720
对他们采取绥靖政策
and let them waltz in and take our country.

667
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,200
我们就要完蛋了，醒醒吧大家！
We are falling asleep at the wheel, people.

668
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,160
你们知道我说的是事实，肯定知道
You know what I'm talking about. I know you do.

669
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,520
现在我们应该展现武力,威慑对方
What if the smartest thing we could do right now

670
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,640
这才是上上策吧？
would be to give them a show of force?

671
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,800
最好是向他们发出警告
I'm talking about a shot across the bow

672
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,880
我想了解听众朋友的观点
I wanna hear what you think.

673
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,610
请拨打热线电话，发表下你对目前局势的看法
Caller number one, you're on the air. What do you think about all this?

674
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,800
这个词怎么念？
What's this word?

675
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,280
行星
"Planet."

676
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,280
不，不
No, no.

677
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,000
比方说，地球是颗行星
That's, like... The Earth is a planet.

678
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,920
我在加略特老师课上做的东西，你要看吗？
Want to see my project from Miss Garriott's class?

679
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,330
好啊，小肉鼻
Yeah, little nose.

680
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,880
我们要做自己的电视节目
We had to make up our own TV show.

681
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,170
如果我们有的话
If we had one.

682
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,560
- 这两个人是谁？  - 你和爸爸
- And who are those two people?  - That's you and Dad.

683
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:49,320
节目叫“爸爸妈妈与动物交谈”
The show is called Mommy and Daddy Talk to Animals.

684
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,210
真有爱
Well, it's lovely.

685
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:58,760
好吧
Okay.

686
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,920
你有权不开心，因为你爸爸和我...
You know it's okay to be sad that your dad and I...

687
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,600
我懂，我没事
I know. I'm not.

688
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,720
我们俩都很爱你
'Cause we both love you very much.

689
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,770
我懂，这只是幅卡通，不代表什么
I know. It's just a cartoon. Not real.

690
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,040
路易丝？
Louise?

691
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,850
你还好吗？
You all right?

692
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,200
嗯
Yeah.

693
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,050
嗯，没什么
Yeah, I'm fine.

694
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:31,040
就是我想给你解释，也可能会力不从心
I'm not sure it's something I can explain.

695
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,520
你没去凯文医生那检查下吗？
When was your last checkup with Dr. Kettler?

696
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,480
我没事
I'm okay.

697
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,770
我出去透透气
I'm gonna get some air.

698
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,560
不用担心
I'm okay.

699
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,240
- 好吧  - 我没事
- All right.  - I'm fine. Yeah.

700
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,960
你感觉好些了吗？
How you feeling?

701
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,640
我需要补充睡眠，不过还挺得住
I need some sleep, but I'm fine.

702
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:52,960
真的？
Yeah.

703
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,960
我最近在研读一种理论，里面讲到
You know, I was doing some reading about this idea that

704
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,120
如果你全身心的钻研一门外语
if you immerse yourself into a foreign language,

705
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,930
整个人都会骤然改变
that you can actually rewire your brain.

706
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,440
嗯，是萨丕尔-沃夫假说
Yeah, the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis.

707
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,960
这种理论
The theory that...

708
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,720
这种理论认为
It's the theory that

709
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:15,400
你所讲的语言能决定你的思维模式
the language you speak determines how you think and...

710
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,640
对，这能影响到你的世界观
Yeah. It affects how you see everything. It was...

711
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,080
我想问下
I'm curious,

712
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,320
你做梦都在说他们的语言吗？
are you dreaming in their language?

713
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:36,000
我是做过这样的梦，可我觉得...
I may have had a few dreams, but I don't...

714
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,360
并不会因此而误了工作
I don't think that that makes me unfit to do this job.

715
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:01,760
你有睡觉吗？
Did you sleep?

716
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,640
睡了会儿
A little.

717
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,680
你懂中文吗?
Do you know Mandarin?

718
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,520
变化了
It is shifting.

719
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,560
你马上要听的声音是来自中国军队的最高统帅
The voice you're about to hear belongs to China's military chief,

720
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,810
尚将军
General Shang.

721
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,120
戴上耳机
Pull it up.

722
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,040
这有卫星信号，你可以边看边听
We got a satellite feed here of who he's talking to,

723
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,690
确定他说了什么
if you want to look.

724
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,050
等等，往回倒
Wait, go back.

725
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,080
停
Stop.

726
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:46,000
他说这12艘船都会给我们先进技术
He's saying that each of the 12 is offering advanced technology.

727
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,760
再回倒，播放
And back again. And play.

728
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:58,210
“我们的科学家团队正尝试破译集合”
"Our science team is attempting to decode the sets."

729
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,920
“集合”，我不明白是什么意思
"Sets." I don't know what that means.

730
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,250
能获取优势之类的
Something about advantage.

731
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,840
“西服，荣誉，花朵”
"Suits, honor, and flowers."

732
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,360
我不...
I don't...

733
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,600
我不明白，就这样
I don't know, that's all.

734
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,840
我也搞不明白
I don't know what it means either.

735
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,680
一小时前，中国的军队开始集结
An hour ago, China mobilized forces.

736
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,640
现在俄罗斯也响应了
And now, Russia is following suit.

737
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,120
尚打定主意要行动了
Shang's about to start something.

738
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,600
跟着西装（跟牌）... 西装...
Following suit, "suits".

739
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,330
是序数牌，字牌，花牌
Suits. Honor. Flowers.

740
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,080
上校，这些都是麻将里的牌
Colonel, those are all tile sets in mahjong.

741
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,290
天啊，难道他们
God, are they...

742
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,920
他们在用游戏和七肢桶沟通吗？
Are they using a game to converse with their heptapods?

743
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,320
有可能...这又如何？
Maybe. Why?

744
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,200
假如我不教英语，而是教七肢桶国际象棋
Well, let's say that I taught them chess instead of English.

745
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,040
通过游戏来进行每句对话
Every conversation would be a game,

746
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:49,440
在对弈的过程中传递每个想法，只有胜负之分
every idea expressed through opposition, victory, defeat.

747
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,640
你还不明白？
You see the problem?

748
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:55,050
如果我只给你把锤子
If all I ever gave you was a hammer...

749
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,570
你看什么都像钉子
Everything's a nail.

750
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,600
我们必须问重大问题
We need to ask the big question.

751
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,160
等不了了
Ready or not.

752
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,560
对，所以...
Right, so...

753
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,600
好，告诉我你所使用的温度，好吗？
Okay, let me know what temperature you use, okay?

754
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,530
不对，这个和以前一样
No, this is the same as before.

755
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,160
- 看  - 我...
- See.  - I...

756
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,320
嗯，不，可是在3和4之间
Yeah, no, but between three and four.

757
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,850
- 好了，该走了  - 好的
- All right, time to go.  - Okay.

758
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,850
还有96分钟可以进行对话，完毕
Ninety-six minutes remaining in the session. Over.

759
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,680
好
Okay.

760
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:50,960
“七肢桶 目的”
Heptapod's purpose.

761
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,210
“七肢桶 目的 地球” 你们来地球的目的？
Heptapod purpose. Earth. What is your purpose?

762
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,960
只有科斯特洛一人？
Do we only have Costello?

763
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,200
很好，你出现了
Okay. There you are.

764
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,760
他说了什么？
What does it say?

765
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,120
给武器
"Offer weapon."

766
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,200
你可是亲眼看到他们写的
But you saw what they wrote.

767
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,610
用的那个词他们还没完全搞明白
Using a word they don't fully understand.

768
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,090
- 这可能只是个请求  - 或者是警告
- It could be just a request.  - Or a warning.

769
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,200
够了
Enough!

770
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:06,760
路易丝
Louise?

771
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,520
我们并不知道他们
We don't know if they understand

772
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:12,080
是否分得清武器和工具
the difference between a weapon and a tool.

773
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,680
我们的语言如同文化般繁杂
Our language, like our culture, is messy,

774
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,370
有时一个词能表达两种意思
and sometimes one can be both.

775
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:20,040
他们很可能想说的是，让我们给他们东西
I think it's quite possible that they're asking us to offer them something,

776
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:23,400
而不是反过来，就像贸易的雏形
not the other way around, like the first part of a trade.

777
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,800
那除了这两个词，我们如何才能搞清他们的意图?
So, how do we clarify their intentions beyond those two words?

778
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,250
我再回去
Well, I go back in.

779
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,480
我们立刻返回，找出真相
Right away, we go back in and we clear this up.

780
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,640
实际操作要比那麻烦得多
It's more complicated than that.

781
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:32,880
哪麻烦了，你说说看？
How is it more complicated than that?

782
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,120
上校，国防部长要跟你通话
Colonel, the Secretary of Defense is on the line for you.

783
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,680
在我们搞清这个之前，一定要保守秘密
We need to sit on this information till we know what it means.

784
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,250
不能让我们的敌人知道了
So, we aren't sharing it with our enemies.

785
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,650
我们还必须考虑一种可能性
We have to consider the idea

786
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,880
我们的访客想以此来挑拨我们内斗
that our visitors are prodding us to fight among ourselves

787
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,240
直到仅有一方胜出
until only one faction prevails.

788
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,480
你这么说根本没有依据
There's no evidence of that.

789
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,920
明显有
Sure there is.

790
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,840
随便翻开本史书
Just grab a history book.

791
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,840
英国同印度，德国同卢旺达
The British with India, the Germans with Rwanda.

792
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,000
在匈牙利他们还专门造了个词
They even got a name for it in Hungary.

793
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,160
嗯
Yeah.

794
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,520
我们的世界是多极的
We're a world with no single leader.

795
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,080
七肢桶不可能只挑选一国来打交道
It's impossible to deal with just one of us.

796
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,840
现在又提到了武器
And with the word "weapon" now...

797
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,920
我是哈尔彭
Halpern.

798
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,200
是的
Yes, sir.

799
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,520
收到，等候指令
Copy that. Waiting for instructions.

800
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,320
还没确认
No confirmation yet.

801
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,840
继续等待
Standing by.

802
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,320
有消息吗？
Anything?

803
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,170
他们说了什么
What did they say?

804
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,440
中国和俄罗斯都离线了，还指望他们能说什么
China and Russia are off the grid. They aren't speaking to anyone.

805
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,640
不管他们在上一次对话中了解到什么，都被吓到了
Whatever they learned in their last session has them spooked.

806
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,640
遵命，长官
Yes, sir.

807
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,530
命令我们也离线
We have orders to do the same.

808
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,800
等等，这些可是我们的盟友
Wait, these are our allies.

809
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:04,960
上校，你不能这么做
Colonel, you can't shut us down.

810
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,760
- 关掉我们的无线电  - 照办
- Put us on radio silence.  - Do it.

811
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,480
七肢桶给我们的消息是...
We received a message from the...

812
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,040
该死！
Damn it!

813
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,000
我们需要保持对话
We need to be talking to each other.

814
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,600
你想跟他们对话？先搞清这是什么意思
You wanna talk to them? Find out what this means.

815
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,040
大本营之间的通讯已中断
Base-camp talk is now offline.

816
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:26,010

- All interpreters... - No confirmation. They're offline.

817
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,050
...都退下，向部门联络员报道

818
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,160
我们之前都没有重启过对话
We've never re-entered a session before.

819
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:35,920
路易丝，相信我好吗？我们还来得及
Look, Louise, trust me, okay? We've got time.

820
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,880
只需要加快进度，对吧？
We've just gotta step on it, all right?

821
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,130
“使用武器”
"Use weapon."

822
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,840
这是外星人发出的信息
This is the alien message

823
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,840
促使中国政府在今天

824
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,600
下令让他们的科学家退出国际合作任务

825
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,520
在一份声明中，尚将军说道
In a statement, General Shang said,

826
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,000
对外星人的分化图谋，中方表示遗憾
"China no longer trusts the aliens who want to divide us.

827
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,570
会以保护全人类为己任
"Humanity must be protected."

828
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:59,240
中国请求联合国召开紧急会议

829
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,050
A19，这是秃鹫，完毕
Alpha one-niner, this is Condor. Over.

830

A19，这是秃鹫

831
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:13,800
请讲，完毕
Come in. Over.

832
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,320
马克斯上尉，这是秃鹫
Captain Marks, Condor.

833
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,560
没有收到回复，收到的话，请回答
Not receiving transmission. Squelch twice if you hear mine.

834
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,160
马克斯上尉，护送人员被要求停止一切行动
Captain Marks, all escort groups are ordered to cease all activity.

835
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,240
不，不行，班克斯博士，你不能进去
No, no, no. Dr. Banks, you can't go in there.

836
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,640
就让我问一个问题
We just need to ask one question.

837
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:06,000
班克斯博士，这次对话已经结束了，你不能...
Dr. Banks, the session is finished. You can't...

838
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,610
你不能再进去，会有危险的
You can't go back in. It's dangerous.

839
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,400
我们只需要5分钟，别紧张
Look, we just need five minutes. Don't sweat it.

840
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,440
马克斯，放他们进去
Marks, let them go.

841
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,040
嘿，阿波特
Hey, Abbott.

842
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:24,210
那么，我们该如何称呼？第37次对话？
So, what are we calling this, session 37?

843
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,290
不，第36次对话第二段
No, 36, part two.

844
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,520
好吧
Okay.

845
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,040
嗯
Yeah.

846
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,880
怎么他们单独进去了？
Why they on their own?

847
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,920
我一直在试着联系马克斯上尉
We've been attempting to hail Captain Marks.

848
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,800
护送小队不肯回应，长官
The escort units are not responding, sir.

849
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:40,880
为什么不回应？
Why not?

850
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,570
派出安保人员
Send security.

851
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:50,280
给武器，问号
"Offer weapon. Question mark."

852
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,440
你们要给我们什么吗？
Are you offering us something?

853
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,130
“技术，设备，方法”？
"Technology. Apparatus. Method"?

854
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,680
嗯，瞧见了吗？这是不同的词
Yeah, see, this is a different word.

855
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,240
这个弧线，它要臃肿得多
This segment, it's a lot busier.

856
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,080
给
"Give.

857
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,450
技术
"Technology.

858
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,080
现在
"Now."

859
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,440
他在做什么？
What's he doing?

860
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,610
上尉，看你十点钟方向
Captain, on your 10.

861
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,650
反叛人员必须立即逮捕
Mutineers are to be apprehended without engaging.

862
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,520
不能让他们激怒我们的访客，完毕
We don't want to risk antagonizing our visitors. Over.

863
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,480
安保分队接近中，长官  4分钟后到达
Security detail inbound, sir. T-minus four minutes remaining.

864
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,170
我们得拿出对策
We need to see this through.

865
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,930
好了，武器上膛，做好准备
Okay, this is it. Lock and load.

866
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,920
只要拖住他们，就能确保任务完成
We just need to hold them off until it's done.

867
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,520
明白 只需警告性射击，压制住他们
Copy that. Warning shots and suppressive fire only.

868
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,840
都上膛，找掩护
Load up and get to cover.

869
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,840
保持镇定，尽量不要造成伤亡
Stay fresh and we can avoid casualties.

870
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,530
阿波特想让我去屏障那写
Abbott wants me to write on the barrier.

871
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,840
你有这个本事？
Can you even do that?

872
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,880
我不知道
I don't know.

873
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,680
我用双手写不了
I can't do it with both hands.

874
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:17,760
路易丝
Louise.

875
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,160
那是什么声音？
What is that?

876
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,970
- 自由开火  - 快过来，我中枪了，我中枪了
- Free fire!  - Over there! I'm hit! I'm hit!

877
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,680
嘿，嘿，别忙着起来
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

878
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,250
你遭受了脑震荡
You suffered a concussion.

879
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,840
还是躺着吧
Just lay back.

880
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,120
你感觉如何？
How are you feeling?

881
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,160
伊恩怎么样了？
How is Ian?

882
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,200
和你一样 没什么大碍
Same as you. He's okay.

883
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,000
谁...
Who...

884
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,930
是谁干的？
Who did this?

885
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,040
几个小兵 看电视看傻了
Some soldiers. Been watching too much TV.

886
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,280
那是什么？
What is that?

887
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,440
别紧张，别紧张
Now, take it easy. Take it easy.

888
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,280
营地不再安全了
The site's no longer secure.

889
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,930
我们正等待疏散
We're standing by to evacuate.

890
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,480
伊恩呢？
Where's Ian?

891
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,650
大约10分钟前，韦伯把他叫走了
Weber came and got him maybe 10 minutes ago.

892
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,720
得知你没事，他才肯离开的
But he wouldn't leave until he knew you were okay.

893
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,800
帐篷里的人都在连轴转
The whole tent is on the clock

894
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:16,610
想破解七肢桶给你的那个天书
to figure out whatever it is you were given up there.

895
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,520
全都在这了？
This is all of it.

896
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,640
图像信号没有因爆炸而中断？
The feed wasn't interrupted by the explosion?

897
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,880
据我所知是这样
Not as far as we can see.

898
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,160
有你能看懂的吗？
You see something?

899
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,480
我还不知道
I don't know yet.

900
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,480
先得把我和路易丝的团队都召集起来
I'm gonna need my team to get together with Louise's team.

901
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:38,890
这需要大家群策群力
I need everybody working on this.

902
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:39,960
我们还不能离开
We cannot leave.

903
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,040
很高兴你醒了
Glad to see you're awake.

904
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:44,880
我们必须回去，我们得向他们解释，这不是我们的过错
We need to go back in and we need to explain to them this wasn't our fault.

905
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,000
- 我们不能再回去了  - 我们必须回去，跟他们解释
- We can't go back inside.  - We have to tell them... We have to.

906
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,160
在那里面发生的是一起袭击
What happened in there was an attack.

907
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:52,160
我们可以指望最好的结果，可也要做好迎接报复的准备
We can hope for the best, but I have orders to prepare for retaliation.

908
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:53,520
我们或许只能疏散
We may have to evacuate.

909
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,490
那样做就错了，只要他们还停在那，我们就应该坚守
No, that's the wrong move. As long as they stay, we have to stay.

910
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,440
他们并没飞走
Well, they're not leaving.

911
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,280
我怎么觉得要出大事？
Why does this feel worse?

912
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,680
中国摆出了进攻架势
China is on the offensive.

913
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:47,040
他们正调动军队，准备对外星人飞船发起攻击
They're positioning their military to blow the alien vessel right out of the sky.

914
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,450
一旦开战
And if this happens,

915
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:53,200
我们不能坐以待毙，所以开始准备吧
we can't sit around waiting for retaliation, so get prepared.

916
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,320
空军和陆军正待命中
The Air Force and infantry are standing by.

917
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,320
遵命
Yes, sir.

918
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,160
突发新闻

919
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:01,280
今晚，中国成为首个向外星人
Tonight, China becomes the first world power

920
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,600
宣战的世界大国
to declare war against the aliens.

921
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:08,040
在联合国的外交斡旋宣告失败后
Following the failure of diplomatic efforts at the United Nations,

922
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:11,480
中国对外证实，他们的语言专家在今晚
China has confirmed that its language experts have, tonight,

923
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,600
向上海的外星人下达了最后通牒
delivered an ultimatum at the Shanghai site.

924
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,800
在一份电视声明中
In a televised statement, General Shang,

925
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,040
中国人民解放军最高统帅，尚将军
Chairman of the People's Liberation Army,

926
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,800
限令外星人24小时内撤出中国
said the aliens have 24 hours to leave Chinese territory

927
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,560
不然将遭到毁灭性打击
or face destruction.

928
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,840
他还敦促其他国家的领导人与中国联合起来
And he urged all other world leaders to unite with China

929
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,440
采取一致行动
and take a similar stance.

930
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:33,880
巴基斯坦，俄罗斯和苏丹都在本国的着陆点
With a huge buildup of forces at their landing sites,

931
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:39,040
集结起大军 预计会紧随中国采取行动
Pakistan, Russia, and Sudan are thought to be following China's lead.

932
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:56,600
这肯定有章可循
It can't be random.

933
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,120
我们怎么也得研究数年
It's going to take us years.

934
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,080
这里该用什么术语？
What's this term here?

935
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:26,410
妈妈
Mom.

936
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,520
老妈？
Mom.

937
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,160
宝贝怎么了？
Sweetie?

938
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:34,680
用来形容那个的术语
What's this term for that thing like a...

939
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:35,960
像是科技术语
Like a technical term?

940
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:40,040
就是我们达成协议，双方都有收获那种？
Where we make a deal and we both get something out of it?

941
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:41,690
妥协吗？
"Compromise."

942
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,880
不是
No.

943
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:48,440
就好比竞争一样，但结果令双方都满意
Like, it's a competition, but both sides end up happy.

944
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,200
是双赢吗？
Like a win-win.

945
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,440
还要更有科学性
More science-y than that.

946
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,480
你要问科学方面的，去打给你父亲
If you want science, call your father.

947
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,450
谢谢
Thank you.

948
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,480
抱歉
Sorry.

949
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,280
没事的，我醒了
It's okay. I'm up.

950
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:33,880
现在什么时候了？
What time is it?

951
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:38,280
是你该拿出上等香槟庆祝的时候了
It's time you open that bottle you've been hiding.

952
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:44,160
你有突破了，是吧？
You cracked something, didn't you?

953
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,440
嗯，快过来
Yeah, come here.

954
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,010
瞧瞧这部分
Take a look at this section.

955
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,520
好像跟时间有关
It seems to be talking about time.

956
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:55,000
他们表示“时间”的符号无处不在
Their symbol for "time" is everywhere.

957
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:56,730
这到底说的什么？
So, what is this?

958
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:00,720
超光速旅行的方案吗？
A formula for faster-than-light travel?

959
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,160
谁敢下结论？
Who can tell?

960
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,570
里面有大段空白
There are too many gaps.

961
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:05,840
全都不完整
Nothing's complete.

962
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,600
然后我恍然大悟
Then it dawned on me.

963
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,010
过来
Come here.

964
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,000
就这儿
Right here.

965
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:16,240
别盯着有字的区域，注意空白区域
Stop focusing on the ones, look at the zeroes.

966
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,520
整个空间里面，有数据的区域和空白区域各占了多少？
How much of this is data? How much of it is negative space?

967
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,760
我于是测了下
So, I measured it.

968
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:26,200
数据的比例是0.0833...
0.0833 recurring.

969
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:35,120
或许你想用分数来表达
Perhaps you'd like that as a fraction.

970
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,200
十二分之一
One of 12.

971
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:46,290
这里传达出的意思是，这只是十二块之一
What they're saying right here is that this is one of 12.

972
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:48,560
我们得到的只是全图的一块
We are part of a larger whole.

973
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,400
这也有可能是让我们十二方厮杀的诱饵
Or we're one of 12 contestants for the prize.

974
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,640
我们为什么要向他汇报？
Why do I have to talk to him?

975
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,370
我们都是在这为国效命
We're all working together here.

976
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,120
我们得联络其他着陆点
We need to talk to the other sites.

977
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,810
我们应该主动支援，帮他们理解从其他七肢桶那得到的信息
We need to help them with what they've gotten from the other heptapods.

978
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,600
你可别忘了，我们现在通讯管制了
In case you don't remember, we're blacked out.

979
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,610
中国才威胁说要摧毁他们那的飞船，我们只能靠自己了
China just threatened to destroy their shell. We're on our own.

980
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,480
可这给的提示是所有分块能组合起来
Yeah, but this says that all of the pieces fit together.

981
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,000
现在根本没人关心这些
And I'm telling you that no one else cares.

982
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,480
两小时前，我们从俄国的一个加密频道截取到一段音频
Two hours ago, we pulled this audio off a secure channel in Russia.

983
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,530
他们科学团队里的一名成员对外直播的
Someone on the science team there was broadcasting wide.

984
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,160
在他们的最后一次对话中，外星人是这样说的：“时候到了...
In their final session, the alien said, "There is no time.

985
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:22,480
”许多合而为一“
"Many become one."

986
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,250
我觉得我们把武器都给完了
I feel we have all been given weapons.

987
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:28,080
如果有人收到这个的话，请..
If anyone is receiving this, please...

988
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,520
我觉得...
Well, I mean,

989
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,610
他刚刚说的话可以有各种解读
there are a lot of ways you can interpret what he's saying.

990
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,680
不需要翻译来解读我也知道它的意思
I don't need an interpreter to know what this means.

991
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,760
俄国为了保密，刚刚处决了
Russia just executed one of their own experts

992
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,170
自己的一名专家
to keep their secrets.

993
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,760
“许多合而为一”可能只是他们想表达
"Many become one" could just be their way of saying,

994
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,530
“要进行一些组合”的意思
"Some assembly required."

995
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,600
为什么要分成块给我们？
Why hand it out to us in pieces?

996
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,200
为什么不给我们完整的？
Why not just give it all over?

997
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,520
让我们人类破天荒的合作一次，没有比这更好的办法了吧？
Well, what better way to force us to work together for once?

998
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,640
就算我相信你
Even if I did believe you,

999
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,240
你有天大的本事吗，能让其他国家乖乖配合
how in the world you gonna get anybody else to play along

1000
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:01,730
交出他们的数据？
or give up their data?

1001
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,840
我们提供自己的来作交换
We offer ours in return.

1002
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:06,600
对
Yeah?

1003
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:08,200
做交易吗？
What, trade?

1004
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,640
这是非零和博弈
It's a non-zero sum game.

1005
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:13,800
非零和博弈
"Non-zero sum game."

1006
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,200
就是它
That's it.

1007
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:19,040
太好了，谢谢
Yeah, thanks.

1008
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:29,880
有9个着陆点都实行了彻底的通讯管制
Nine of the landing sites have gone total comms blackout.

1009
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,480
要想联络他们，就只有开车去边境
Only way to reach them is to physically drive there and yell

1010
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,210
让他们的边防人员传话，我们已经在办了，可这样肯定来不及
at the border guards, which we're doing, but it won't be fast enough.

1011
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,800
一定有别的渠道来给他们发消息
There's got to be a way to... To get the message to them.

1012
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:40,800
对我们的盟友可能有，不过到了这种局面，效果有限，也太迟了
To our allies maybe, but at this stage, it's too little too late.

1013
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:43,720
世界大战一触即发，我们却还
What we need is to get all the other nations online

1014
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:45,520
联络不上各方，当务之急
before one starts global war,

1015
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,680
是让有关各国都恢复联网
and there's no way for us to reach them.

1016
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,250
等下，先等会儿
Wait. Hold on a second.

1017
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:50,560
有渠道
There is.

1018
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,160
我们上方不就有吗
It's right above us.

1019
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,600
可我们现在很难办到啊
That's problematic for us right now.

1020
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:58,930
五角大楼确信我们这的“蛋壳”会实施报复
The Pentagon's convinced our shell will retaliate.

1021
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,200
估计一个小时内就要下令疏散了
My guess is they'll order us to evacuate within the hour.

1022
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,010
听我说，他们不是敌人
Look, they're not our enemy.

1023
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,800
他们从未有过任何挑衅我们的行为
They've made no act of aggression towards us.

1024
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,840
或许那就是他们的挑衅方式
Maybe this is their way of being aggressive.

1025
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,840
那不是问题所在
That's not the question.

1026
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,000
那问题是什么？
Well, what is the question?

1027
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,600
我们如何能将你俩送回离地800米高的房间？
How do we get you back in that room when it's half a mile straight up?

1028
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:17,250
我觉得任务都结束了
I think our work here is done.

1029
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:20,680
现在交由我们的上级决断了
It's in the hands of our superiors now.

1030
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,080
她又想搞什么名堂？
What the hell is she doing?

1031
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:39,880
不，天啊，天啊
No. God. Oh, God. No.

1032
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,000
科斯特洛？
Costello?

1033
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,570
阿波特呢？
Where's Abbott?

1034
01:29:15,490 --> 01:29:18,620
“阿波特成了死的了”

1035
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,530
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1036
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,960
我们都很抱歉
We're sorry.

1037
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,480
我需要你......
I need you to...

1038
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:51,080
我需要你发消息给其它着陆点
I need you to send a message to the other sites.

1039
01:29:57,570 --> 01:30:00,890
路易丝有武器

1040
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:10,520
使用武器

1041
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:11,880
我不
I don't...

1042
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,000
我不明白
I don't understand.

1043
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:17,760
你们来这的目的是什么？
What is your purpose here?

1044
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:27,900
我们来帮助人类

1045
01:30:33,340 --> 01:30:36,250
3000年后......

1046
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:42,260
我们需要人类的帮助

1047
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:47,000
你怎么能预知未来？
How can you know the future?

1048
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,210
我不...
I don't...

1049
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:08,040
我不明白
I don't understand.

1050
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,160
这个孩子是谁？
Who is this child?

1051
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,320
这个节目叫“爸爸妈妈与动物交谈”
The show is called Mommy and Daddy Talk to Animals.

1052
01:31:31,770 --> 01:31:34,850
路易丝能预知未来

1053
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:48,310
武器能打开时光隧道

1054
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:54,920
等下...
Wait.

1055
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,080
别走，等下！
No... Wait!

1056
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:47,800
- 班克斯博士！  - 路易丝！
- Dr. Banks!  - Louise!

1057
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:49,560
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

1058
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,400
- 你没事吧？  - 嗯
- Hey. You all right?  - Yeah.

1059
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,160
过来吧，发生了什么？  - 我没事
- Here, come on. What happened?  - I'm fine.

1060
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:58,000
我正想搞明白，这事关重大
Tried to figure it out. This is too big.

1061
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,890
现在都不重要了，我们接到命令要疏散了
Doesn't matter now. We have orders to evacuate.

1062
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:04,760
- 为什么？  - 俄国和苏丹会效仿中国
- Why?  - Russia and Sudan are following China.

1063
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:08,320
伊恩，我不明白这是为什么
Ian. I don't understand why the...

1064
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:09,640
帮帮我，妈妈
Help me, Mama.

1065
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:12,080
路易丝
Louise?

1066
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:13,400
天啊
Oh, my God.

1067
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:14,840
妈妈！
Mom.

1068
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,200
妈妈!
Mama!

1069
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:22,760
抱歉，宝贝
Sorry, honey.

1070
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:28,600
今天星期几，宝贝你知道吗？
What day is it? Do you know, baby?

1071
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:29,920
星期天
Sunday.

1072
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:38,120
你要像爸爸那样离开我吗？
Are you gonna leave me like Daddy did?

1073
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:42,480
汉娜宝贝，你爸爸没有离开你
Hannah, honey, your daddy didn't leave you.

1074
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:45,040
你会见到他的，就这个周末
You're gonna see him this weekend.

1075
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,600
他看我的眼神和以前不同了
He doesn't look at me the same way anymore.

1076
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,720
这要怪我
That's my fault.

1077
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,890
我跟他说了些事，他一时半会儿没法接受
I told him something that he wasn't ready to hear.

1078
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:07,240
什么事？
What?

1079
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:13,800
信不信由你
Well, believe it or not,

1080
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:16,560
我知道将来会发生的事
I know something that's going to happen.

1081
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:21,400
我也没法解释清楚，我就是知道
I can't explain how I know. I just do.

1082
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:25,920
在我告诉你爸爸后，他气坏了
And when I told your daddy, he got really mad.

1083
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:30,680
他说我做了错误的选择
And he said I made the wrong choice.

1084
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:35,440
将来会发生什么？
What? What's going to happen?

1085
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:42,280

1087
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,600
有点像你一样
Kind of like you are.

1088
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:55,560
你是如此神奇，你的诗歌

1089
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:58,920
还有你给世界增添的各种美好事物

1090
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,320
我势不可挡？

1091
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:03,440

把这些人送出去
Get those people back, please.

1104
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:26,810
你的名字很特别，因为它是回文
Well, your name is very special because it is a palindrome.

1105
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,160
顺读倒读均相同的字
It reads the same forward and backward.

1106
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:33,080
- 好了，大伙来帮帮我  - 好的，长官
- All right, guys, give me a hand here.  - Yes, sir.

1107

1120
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:46,920
这不是什么武器，这是件礼物
It's not a weapon, it's a gift.

1121
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:49,480
武器是指他们的语言
The weapon is their language.

1122
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:51,600
他们全都交给了我们，你明不明白？
They gave it all to us. Do you understand what that means?

1123
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:54,720
让我们学他们的语言？先保命再说吧
So we can learn Heptapod, if we survive.

1124
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:57,690

If you learn it, when you really learn it,

1125
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,920
你就会用他们的方式感知时间
you begin to perceive time the way that they do.

1126

这样你就能知道将来会发生什么
So you can see what's to come.

1127
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,120
而且，他们所理解的时间和我们并不相同
But time, it isn't the same for them.

1128
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:07,480
- 是非线性的  - 听着
- It's non-linear.  - Look.

1129
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:10,080
我们竭尽所能了，可还是差一点
We did our best, but it wasn't enough.

1130
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:13,000

连我上司都没这个本事
Something not even my superior has done.

1150
01:39:58,240 --> 01:39:59,840
是什么事？

1151
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:01,840
你改变了我的心意

你是我们能联合起来的原因

1153
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:12,400
全靠你拨通了我的私人号码
All because you reached out to me on my private number.

1154
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:15,480
你的私人号码
Your private number.

1155
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:18,080
将军，我并不知道啊

现在你知道了
