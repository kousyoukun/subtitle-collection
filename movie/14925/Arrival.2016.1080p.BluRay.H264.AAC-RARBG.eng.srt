1
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,367
I used to think
this was the beginning of your story.

2
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,688
Memory is a strange thing.

3
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,681
It doesn't work like I thought it did.

4
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,881
We are so bound by time,

5
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,929
by its order.

6
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,560
Okay.

7
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,404
Okay, come back to me.

8
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,131
Come back to me.

9
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,085
Come back to me.

10
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,571
Stick 'em up!

11
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,324
Are you the sheriff in this here town?

12
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,731
These are my tickle guns,
and I'm gonna get ya.

13
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,486
No.

14
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,962
You want me to chase you? You better run.

15
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,927
I remember moments in the middle.

16
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,770
I love you.

17
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,006
I hate you!

18
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,010
And this was the end.

19
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,484
Come back to me.

20
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,764
Come back to me.

21
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,843
But now I'm not so sure
I believe in beginnings and endings.

22
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,001
There are days
that define your story beyond your life.

23
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,642
Like the day they arrived.

24
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,321
Good morning.

25
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,686
- Morning.
- Morning.

26
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,770
Where is everyone?

27
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,882
Okay. Well, let's get started.

28
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,685
Today, we are talking about Portuguese

29
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,851
and why it sounds so different
from the other Romance languages.

30
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,531
The story of Portuguese
begins in the kingdom of Galicia...

31
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,442
- Sorry.
- ...in the Middle Ages,

32
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,491
where language was seen
as an expression of art.

33
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,210
Any news you wanna share?

34
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,123
Dr. Banks, can you
turn the TV to a news channel?

35
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,567
...arrived here on scene,

36
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,723
but police have already set up
a blockade here around the area.

37
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,326
As you can see, we've gotten
just about as close as we can,

38
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,724
but unfortunately, Montana, right now,
is on complete lockdown.

39
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,326
The object apparently touched down
40 minutes ago just north of I-94.

40
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,764
We're waiting to hear if this is perhaps
an experimental vessel or...

41
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,240
Hold on.

42
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,686
I'm learning that
more objects like this have landed

43
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,287
at as many as eight other locations
around the world.

44
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,641
Yes. Can we?

45
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,764
This is from a site in Hokkaido.

46
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,085
This is worldwide.
It is happening right now.

47
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,966
Okay.

48
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,564
That's... Class is dismissed.

49
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,241
For now,
we're simply asking for cooperation

50
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,601
while authorities assess the object.

51
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,284
So, you're saying it's not ours?

52
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,770
Do you even know if it's from Earth?

53
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,128
We're still collecting information.
We're coordinating with other countries.

54
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,444
We are not the only ones
to have one of these in our backyard.

55
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,364
If this is some sort of
peaceful first contact,

56
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,283
why send 12?

57
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,124
Why not just one?

58
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,647
Yeah, I know. I saw that, too.

59
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,326
I don't know, Mom. I'm watching
the same news coverage you are.

60
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,404
Well, Mom, please don't bother
with that channel.

61
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,723
How many times do I have to
tell you those people are idiots?

62
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,047
Yeah, well, do I sound nervous?

63
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,968
Okay, exactly. So...

64
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,848
Me? Yeah. You know me, I'm about the same.

65
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,250
Mom, I'm fine.

66
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,762
Okay, I'll call you later. Bye.

67
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,850
And at around eight hours after landing,

68
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,083
there are still no signs
of what might be called "first contact."

69
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,006
Now, the objects measure
at least 1, 500 feet tall.

70
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,811
Two are reported to have
penetrated Russian airspace,

71
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,367
one in Siberia and the other
off the coast of the Black...

72
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,850
...suspended above the ocean.

73
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,720
So far, there are 12 unidentified objects
spread across the globe.

74
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,531
There is no obvious logic
to their locations

75
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,166
and no evidence that the ships are even...

76
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,687
...who entertain the idea
that if it is a kind of vessel,

77
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,484
it may be unmanned.

78
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,007
Regardless, we have a protocol
for scenarios like this, but...

79
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,043
After Tuesday's extraordinary events,

80
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,044
the President, this morning,
has declared a state of emergency,

81
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,885
with as many as 5, 000 National Guard
being deployed

82
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,803
to the state of Montana alone.

83
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,962
Borders are closed
and flights have been grounded,

84
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,804
stranding millions of travelers.

85
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,441
Panic buying of gas, water, and food
continues to escalate

86
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,649
and federal authorities
have temporarily lifted all caps

87
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,961
on overtime for law enforcement.

88
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,487
The ATF has put a temporary ban
on new gun licenses,

89
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,406
forcing many independent suppliers
of hunting equipment and firearms

90
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,482
to close their doors to the public.

91
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,325
Forty-eight hours later
and no further development...

92
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,447
Two days.

93
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,930
...from the sight of the 12 UFO...

94
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,606
And already the public expects us
to know the answers.

95
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,929
I'm Colonel G.T. Weber.

96
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,287
We never formally met,

97
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,001
but two years ago, you did some
Farsi translations for Army intelligence.

98
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,526
You made quick work
of those insurgent videos.

99
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,762
You made quick work of those insurgents.

100
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,042
You are on the top of everyone's list
when it comes to translations.

101
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,367
And you have another two years
in the SSBI.

102
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,448
So, you still have top-secret clearance.

103
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,169
That's why I'm in your office
and not at Berkeley.

104
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,245
Okay.

105
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,041
I have something
I need you to translate for me.

106
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,165
Why are you here?

107
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,807
Can you... Can you understand us?

108
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,851
Where did you come from?

109
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,411
Now you heard it.

110
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,765
What do you make of it?

111
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,331
Is that...

112
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,286
Yes.

113
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,760
How many?

114
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,851
How many what?

115
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,603
How many speaking?

116
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,601
Two.

117
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,640
Assume they were not speaking
at the same time.

118
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,566
Are you sure? Did they have mouths...

119
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,530
How would you approach translating this?

120
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,531
Do you hear any words?

121
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,326
Phrases?

122
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,209
I don't... I don't know.

123
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,050
So, what can you tell me?

124
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,290
I can tell you that it's impossible
to translate from an audio file.

125
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,966
I would need to be there
to interact with them.

126
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,724
You didn't need that
with the Farsi translations.

127
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,643
I didn't need it because I already
knew the language.

128
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,768
But this, this is...

129
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,404
I know what you're doing.

130
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,961
- Tell me what I'm doing.
- I'm not taking you to Montana.

131
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,282
It's all I can do to keep it
from turning into a tourist site

132
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,327
for everybody who has a TS clearance.

133
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,404
I'm just telling you what it would take
to do this job.

134
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,164
This is not a negotiation.

135
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,208
If I leave here, your chance is gone.

136
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,521
Good day.

137
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,606
Colonel?

138
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,686
You mentioned Berkeley,
are you going to ask Danvers next?

139
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,761
Maybe.

140
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,363
Before you commit to him,

141
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,842
ask him the Sanskrit word for "war"
and its translation.

142
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,647
An agreement on sharing scientific
discoveries looks closer tonight,

143
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,803
as Russia and China join talks
at the United Nations.

144
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,887
Meanwhile, financial markets
across the world are in crisis

145
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,806
as the Dow Jones Industrial Average
fell over 2,000 points

146
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,281
in its worst weekly decline in history.

147
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,246
Mornin'.

148
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,446
Colonel.

149
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,490
Gavisti. He says it means "an argument."

150
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,641
What do you say it means?

151
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,489
"A desire for more cows."

152
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,565
Pack your bags.

153
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,366
All right, give me 20 minutes?

154
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,771
We take off in 10.

155
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,481
Dr. Banks. Right this way, please.

156
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,524
Contact and ready to approach...

157
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,080
Excuse me, Dr. Banks, let me
make sure you're properly secured.

158
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,600
You okay?

159
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,846
Thanks.

160
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,962
Sorry, I couldn't hear
what you were saying.

161
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,610
"Language is the foundation
of civilization.

162
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,286
"It is the glue
that holds a people together.

163
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,727
"It is the first weapon
drawn in a conflict."

164
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,766
Louise, this is Ian Donnelly.

165
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,490
Louise Banks, Ian Donnelly.

166
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,607
It's quite a greeting.

167
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,245
Yeah. Well, you wrote it.

168
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,767
Yeah, but...

169
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,606
It's the kind of thing you write
as a preface,

170
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,603
dazzle them with the basics.

171
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,570
Yeah. It's great.

172
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,926
Even if it's wrong.

173
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,206
It's wrong?

174
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,807
Well, the cornerstone of civilization
isn't language, it's science.

175
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,201
Ian is a theoretical physicist
from Los Alamos.

176
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,524
You'll be reporting to me, but you'll be
working with him when you're in the shell.

177
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,683
That's what they're calling the UFO.

178
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,287
Priority one. What do they want,
where are they from.

179
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,681
And beyond that, how did they get here?

180
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,206
Are they capable of
faster-than-light travel?

181
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,327
Are they...

182
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,847
I have a list of questions that,
you know, we can go over.

183
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,490
Starting with a series of just
a "handshake" of binary sequences...

184
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,050
How about we just talk to them

185
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,248
before we start
throwing math problems at them?

186
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,608
This is why you're both here.

187
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,290
I'll bring the coffee.

188
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,404
Coffee with some aliens.

189
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,929
All right. I want you
to take these two to Dr. Kettler.

190
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,047
Yes, sir.

191
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,645
Follow the captain to Medical.

192
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,606
The procedure should take just a few
minutes, and then, we'll get started.

193
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,363
These men are gonna
take care of your bags.

194
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,646
I'll take your cell phones.

195
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,441
Cell phones.

196
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,041
Follow me.

197
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,849
Put these on.
You're gonna wear them at all times.

198
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,206
- Not until they're here.
- Great.

199
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,085
Sir, they're here.

200
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,841
Louise Banks? Ian Donnelly?

201
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,485
When was the last time
either of you have eaten?

202
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,240
- Last night.
- Same.

203
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,765
When's the last time
you did something stressful?

204
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,481
Does now count?

205
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,401
Just saying.

206
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,246
Who was being carted off in the medevac?

207
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,130
Not everyone is able
to process experiences like this.

208
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,043
I'm gonna get some blood from you

209
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,488
and give you an immunization dose
that covers a battery of bacterial threats.

210
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,925
Would you sign these, please?

211
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,240
And roll up your sleeves.

212
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,486
Either of you claustrophobic?

213
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,890
- Nope.
- No.

214
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,045
Currently taking any medications?
Allergies? Pregnant?

215
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,761
No.

216
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,808
The booster is a kick to your system,

217
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,609
so you may experience some side-effects,

218
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,762
nausea, dizziness, headaches,

219
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,320
a ringing in your ears
like you have tinnitus.

220
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,450
You see what's happening to him?

221
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,806
How does this even work?

222
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,803
The readings do not change, but...

223
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,281
I don't know. It's like
we're insects on a piece of paper

224
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,045
and they're easing us out of the house.

225
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,124
At exactly 112 minutes and 19 seconds,

226
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,647
the gravity starts to shift
and slides us out of the room.

227
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,610
Have you found
a scientific explanation for it?

228
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,722
Like, is it for them?

229
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,006
No, we think it's for us.

230
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,801
The air doesn't seem to circulate
inside the chamber,

231
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,804
so after about two hours,
you run out of oxygen.

232
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,327
It doesn't take 18 hours
to pump fresh air into a room.

233
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,526
Atmosphere.

234
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,647
Excuse me?

235
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,166
If their atmosphere
is different from Earth,

236
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,685
it would certainly take hours

237
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,966
to rebalance the O2 content and pressure
for us every time they open their door.

238
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,402
So, you're saying they could
suffocate us if they wanted?

239
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,409
This is Agent David Halpern with the CIA.

240
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,163
Let me get you two to your stations.

241
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,207
Yes, sir.

242
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,806
Remember, we need answers
as soon as possible.

243
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,009
What do they want,
where are they from, why they're here.

244
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,525
- This is the priority.
- Yeah.

245
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,525
Everyone, this is Dr. Ian Donnelly.
He'll be running this team here.

246
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,807
Yeah, have they responded to anything?

247
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,360
Shapes, patterns, numbers, Fibonacci?

248
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,522
We can't tell what they are saying
when they respond to "hello,"

249
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,604
so don't get ahead of yourself.

250
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,961
What have you figured out?

251
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,121
We're just getting started.

252
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,329
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

253
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,129
This is Dr. Louise Banks.

254
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,247
She'll be heading your team.

255
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,084
- Dr. Banks. It's a pleasure meeting you.
- Hi.

256
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,322
Dr. Banks is taking over
the mission from Dr. Walker.

257
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,323
- Nice to see you.
- Dr. Banks, glad to see you.

258
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,448
That's your 15-minute warning.

259
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,565
You scuba-dive before?

260
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,768
What kind of radiation exposure
are we walking into?

261
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,888
Nominal, these are just for safety.

262
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,009
So, is there any physical contact
with the...

263
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,124
Am I the only one having
trouble saying "aliens"?

264
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,010
There's a wall, like a glass wall.
You can't get to them.

265
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,326
So, what do they look like?

266
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,524
You'll see soon enough. Hurry up.

267
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,129
Thank you. Turn this way, please.

268
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,208
All units, stand by. Over.

269
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,009
The suits are clumsy at first,
but you get used to them.

270
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,845
Load up in the second vehicle.

271
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,805
Hurry up, hurry up. Bring it over here.

272
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,881
We're clear over here, sir.

273
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,241
All set, sir. This is the last box
for this truck. This truck's clear.

274
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,521
Let's go!

275
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,045
We'll be there in a few minutes.

276
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,371
Make sure you hold on to something.

277
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,447
We are now inside the demilitarized zone.

278
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,330
- Raise 1.2 klicks. Over.
- Copy, Alpha.

279
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,290
We'll continue to monitor vitals
and signal clarity from operations.

280
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,806
Airpicket's in position
and fully operational.

281
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,326
Countermeasures in place
and ready for deployment. Over.

282
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,242
Copy, Condor.
We will observe, but not initiate. Over.

283
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,921
Watch your step.

284
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,527
We'll keep Alpha channel open. Over.

285
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,330
Alpha, be advised.
Humidity increased since yesterday.

286
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,686
Every 18 hours,

287
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,289
the door opens up at the bottom.

288
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,281
That's where we go in.

289
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,045
Red team on standby.

290
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,244
Zero movement.
Alpha detail, clear to proceed. Over.

291
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,530
Copy, Condor.
Beginning our ascent now Over.

292
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,441
Ten feet.

293
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,291
Five feet.

294
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,371
Two. One.

295
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,685
Alpha, clear to enter antechamber. Over.

296
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,729
Copy, Condor. Moving into position. Over.

297
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,569
Thirty feet from target.

298
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,361
Suit telemetry now full strength,
despite unknown interference. Over.

299
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,365
Five feet. Two, one.

300
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,567
Oxygen level, 20.3%.
No known contaminates. Over.

301
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,887
Vitals normal.

302
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,929
Gravity at 0. 97.

303
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,808
Radio signal strength decreasing.

304
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,402
90%. 85%. Fluctuating...

305
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,169
Yeah, that just happened.

306
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,684
All right, let's move. Time is wasting.

307
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,201
You ready?

308
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,366
Let's do it.

309
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,808
Condor, I'm proceeding first
with Captain Marks. Over.

310
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,042
Radio signal strength 75%. Over.

311
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,010
Landed. Gravity nominal
in the antechamber. Over.

312
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,206
It's all good, sir.

313
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,124
- You can proceed.
- Stand by.

314
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,960
Okay, bring it up.

315
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,801
Vitals in line.

316
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,487
Radio signal strength stable at 75%. Over.

317
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,401
You okay?

318
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,641
Yeah.

319
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,161
Dr. Banks.

320
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,846
You can do this.

321
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,481
Come on.

322
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,047
I don't know, I... I think...

323
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,441
Grab her.

324
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,562
Dr. Donnelly, are you all right?

325
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,682
Dr. Donnelly. You good?

326
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,286
Dr. Donnelly, are you all right?
Please respond. Over.

327
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,761
Yeah.

328
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,566
Holy fuck.

329
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,447
We're gonna go down there,

330
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,090
and you're gonna start your job.

331
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,161
Okay.

332
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,402
- Okay? Everybody, move out.
- Okay.

333
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,043
Alpha detail is in position.

334
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,645
Team is in position.

335
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,405
We're on the move.

336
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,322
Condor, Alpha's now in the nave.

337
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,127
Setting up equipment and telemetry. Over.

338
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,771
Oxygen level, 21.3%. Over.

339
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,571
So, what happens now?

340
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,965
They arrive.

341
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,201
Dr. Banks.

342
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,681
Dr. Banks.

343
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,205
You can start.

344
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,090
Alpha detail, proceed directly
through the decontamination...

345
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,605
...to the inner airlock.

346
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,287
Do not stop until you have passed
through the airlock doors.

347
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,328
Do not attempt to remove the hazmat suit

348
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,006
without proper assistance
of authorized personnel.

349
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,766
Repeat. Hazmat suits without
assistance of authorized personnel.

350
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,002
- Wait, just a minute. A minute.
- All right.

351
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,445
Keep your head low.

352
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,167
Clear.

353
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,691
- All right.
- Step on out, please.

354
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,961
Now hold that.

355
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,561
Am I fired?

356
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,611
You did better than the last guy.

357
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,522
That doesn't make me feel any better.

358
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,042
You both have till 0200 hours
to figure something out.

359
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,281
Okay, what happens then?

360
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,805
You go back in.

361
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,090
Violence continues
to spread across the US today

362
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,003
in the wake of the 12 landings.

363
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,050
The President has declared
a mandatory dusk-to-dawn curfew

364
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,168
after the crackdown by the National Guard

365
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,722
failed to prevent a third night
of looting across the country.

366
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,089
In North Dakota, 144 members
of the St. Lawrence Pentecostal Cult

367
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,845
are feared dead
after they set their compound ablaze.

368
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,924
Their website claims
the arrival of the aliens

369
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,767
set in motion a prophecy that
12 sets of 12 should "follow the lamb."

370
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,881
And this is Seven-November.
Roger, stand by...

371
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,240
Got that request...

372
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,130
We're up in 15. You got any new intel?

373
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,044
Yeah, we've been playing back
some of their sounds.

374
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,006
Where does that get you?

375
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,205
Well, they play audio back at us
from an unseen source.

376
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,646
Audio of what?

377
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,649
It's bits of conversation from the room,
random clips of dialogue.

378
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,405
Really, we... We have nothing.

379
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,966
T-minus 14 minutes to shell access.

380
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,725
Are you receiving my signal?

381
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,561
Yes. It's sending.

382
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,642
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay. Good hunting.

383
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,687
Heading out.

384
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,250
Checking in for radio.
Are you receiving me?

385
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,245
You're coming in loud and clear.

386
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,081
Good luck, Doctor.

387
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:10,528
T-minus nine minutes to shell access.

388
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,840
What's that for?

389
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,440
A visual aid.

390
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,327
Look, I'm never going to be able to
speak their words if they are talking.

391
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,682
But they might have some sort of written
language or basis for visual communication.

392
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,683
Okay. Let's get started.

393
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,007
Human.

394
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,161
"Human."

395
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,446
I'm human.

396
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,006
What are you?

397
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,646
Human.

398
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,887
Affirmative, Alpha...

399
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,081
Oh, my God.

400
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,731
Are you getting this?

401
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,808
Yes, sir.
It's uploading back to base camp.

402
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,441
Louise.

403
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,651
That's incredible.

404
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,881
Human.

405
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,527
Human.

406
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,081
Human.

407
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,841
Okay.

408
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,531
Okay, slow down, fellas.

409
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,521
Slow down.

410
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,406
I don't wanna take away
from your success in there,

411
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,960
but, Dr. Banks,
is this really the right approach?

412
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,887
Trying to teach 'em how to speak and read?

413
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,121
That's gotta take longer.

414
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,771
You're wrong. It's faster.

415
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,327
Everything you do in there
I have to explain to a room full of men

416
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,525
whose first and last question is,
"How can this be used against us?"

417
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,486
So, you're gonna
have to give me more than that.

418
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,371
Kangaroo.

419
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,850
What is that?

420
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,330
In 1770,

421
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,722
Captain James Cook's ship ran
aground off the coast of Australia,

422
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,407
and he led a party into the country
and they met the Aboriginal people.

423
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,529
One of the sailors pointed
at the animals that hop around

424
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,364
and put their babies in their pouch,

425
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,250
and he asked what they were,
and the Aborigines said, "Kanguru."

426
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,360
And the point is?

427
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,526
It wasn't until later that they learned that
"kanguru" means "I don't understand."

428
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,241
So, I need this so that we
don't misinterpret things in there,

429
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,164
otherwise this is
gonna take 10 times as long.

430
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,569
I could sell that for now.

431
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,728
But I need you
to submit your vocabulary words

432
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,881
before the next session.

433
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,487
Fair.

434
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,166
And remember
what happened to the Aborigines.

435
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,802
A more advanced race nearly wiped 'em out.

436
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,329
It's a good story.

437
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,526
Thanks.

438
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,885
It's not true.

439
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,803
But it proves my point.

440
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,329
We think we were able to reproduce

441
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,006
some prime number sequences back at them.

442
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,246
So, that's something.

443
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,368
Well, congratulations. You're a parrot.

444
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,966
Well, it's a lot more than that,
you cheeky bastard.

445
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,964
Don't you see?
They can't seem to follow our algebra.

446
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,086
But complex behaviors? That clicks.

447
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,330
Well, that doesn't make
any sense at all, does it?

448
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,727
The problem is, not everyone shares
our policy of being open with the aliens.

449
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,404
Have you met General Shang?

450
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,365
Call sign for him is "Big Domino."

451
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,842
Whatever Shang does,
at least four other nations will follow.

452
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,570
- Louise, you have to gain ground today.
- Okay.

453
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,211
- You have a vocabulary list for me?
- I do.

454
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,249
You're gonna teach them
your name and Ian's?

455
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,210
Yes, so that we can learn their names,
if they have names,

456
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,408
and then introduce pronouns later.

457
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,124
These are all grade-school words.

458
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,809
"Eat." "Walk."

459
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,485
Help me understand.

460
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,566
Okay.

461
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,484
No, no, no, not the top!

462
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,207
Okay, this is
where you wanna get to, right?

463
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,725
- That is the question.
- Okay.

464
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,566
So, first we need to make sure
that they understand what a question is.

465
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,241
Okay? The nature
of a request for information

466
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,765
along with a response.

467
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,083
Then, we need to clarify

468
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,324
the difference between
a specific "you" and a collective "you,"

469
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,803
because we don't want to know
why Joe Alien is here.

470
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,360
We want to know why they all landed.

471
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,082
And "purpose" requires
an understanding of intent.

472
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,925
We need to find out,
do they make conscious choices

473
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,207
or is their motivation so instinctive

474
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,363
that they don't understand
a "why" question at all.

475
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,570
And... And biggest of all, we need to
have enough vocabulary with them

476
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,642
that we understand their answer.

477
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,524
I get it.

478
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,244
Stick to your list.

479
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:32,648
Just don't add anything to it.

480
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,522
Gravity, 0.97. Oxygen level, 21.4%. Over.

481
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,841
Condor, Alpha's now in the main.

482
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,321
Setting up equipment and telemetry. Over.

483
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,731
Let's get started.

484
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,206
"Louise."

485
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,083
Louise. I am Louise.

486
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,650
What is that?

487
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,324
Is that a new symbol? I can't tell.

488
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,324
I don't know
I think it's the symbol for "human" again.

489
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,689
It just has a little curl on the end,
maybe to indicate a question.

490
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,921
I don't know.

491
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,600
I don't know, Louise.

492
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,249
I think they're getting confused.

493
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,648
Dr. Banks, perhaps we should
move on to the next word.

494
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,647
Dr. Banks?

495
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,370
- It's okay, Nate.
- What's going on?

496
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,522
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?

497
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,881
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Are you insane?

498
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,200
They need to see me.

499
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,484
She's taking off her hazmat suit.
Dr. Banks!

500
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,046
Is it okay?

501
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,485
You're risking contamination.

502
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,486
They need to see me.

503
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,561
Dr. Banks.

504
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,001
Dr. Banks.

505
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,127
She's walking towards the screen.

506
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,884
Should we abort?

507
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,566
Request noted. Stand by for frag order.

508
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,687
Go back to your stations.

509
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,641
Now that's a proper introduction.

510
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,801
Okay.

511
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,207
"Louise."

512
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,090
I am Louise.

513
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,047
Ian, you want to introduce yourself?

514
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,081
Yeah.

515
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,441
Louise.

516
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,167
Screw it.

517
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,450
Everybody dies, right?

518
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,970
Sir, Donnelly is taking off
his hazmat suit.

519
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,485
Permission to abort?

520
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,525
Continue the session.

521
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,121
Ian.

522
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,926
Louise.

523
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,847
You.

524
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,971
Who are you?

525
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,050
I think those are their names.

526
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,251
They have names.

527
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,969
So, what are we gonna call them?

528
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,641
I don't know.

529
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,162
I was thinking Abbott and Costello.

530
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,281
Yeah.

531
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,569
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I like it.

532
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,246
I like it.

533
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,123
Team 1, exit your vehicle

534
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,363
and proceed directly ahead
to the decontamination tent.

535
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,091
Leave your respirator on
until you reach the equipment room.

536
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,086
I know.

537
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:12,444
Team 2, exit your vehicles and continue
to the decontamination tent.

538
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,325
Leave your respirators on

539
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,529
and do not hesitate
until you reach the equipment room.

540
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,286
How do you feel?

541
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,725
Overworked.

542
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,922
Well, I guess I don't need to tell you,
you're putting yourself at risk.

543
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,925
There are no signs
of radiation poisoning yet.

544
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,889
We'll see how your blood tests look.

545
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,363
For now, I'm gonna give you another boost.

546
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,726
Okay.

547
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,365
No radiation.

548
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,044
Nothing else we can detect either,

549
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,600
but I'd give 'em
a strong cocktail regardless.

550
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,286
It's the first time
we've made significant progress.

551
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,485
All right.

552
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,809
We'll take the risk.

553
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,283
- Okay, honey...
- What is going on there?

554
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,886
- Honey.
- Is there anything you can tell me?

555
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,884
No... You don't need to worry, okay?

556
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,361
- How can I not worry?
- Just calm down.

557
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,521
Just calm down.

558
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,483
Becky asked me if
the monsters are going to kill Daddy,

559
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,927
Honey, it's not gonna happen.

560
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,410
Just stay safe.

561
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,720
You don't need to worry.

562
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,689
Please, I'm so scared.

563
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:28,084
All junior xenolinguistics
and science personnel must observe

564
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,766
general curfew unless expressly authorized

565
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,525
for extended work hours by unit COs.

566
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:37,207
Curfew in effect as of 2200 hours.

567
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,890
Notice to all late workers,
fire watchers and night staff.

568
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:46,363
Effective immediately, midnight rations
will be served all night.

569
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,486
Here are some of the many things
we don't know about heptapods.

570
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:42,007
Greek. Hepta, "Seven. " Pod, "Foot."

571
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,401
"Seven feet." Heptapod.

572
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,445
Who are they?

573
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,207
Trying to answer this
in any meaningful way

574
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,964
is hampered by the fact that,

575
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,407
outside being able
to see them and hear them,

576
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,609
the heptapods leave
absolutely no footprint.

577
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,689
The chemical composition
of their spaceship is unknown.

578
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,810
The shell emits no waste,
no gas, no radiation.

579
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,565
Assuming that the shells
communicate with each other,

580
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,210
they do so without detection.

581
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:17,482
The air between the shells is untroubled
by sonic emission or light wave.

582
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,170
Are they scientists or tourists?

583
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,608
If they're scientists, they don't seem
to ask a lot of questions.

584
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,563
Why did they park where they did?

585
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,284
The world's most decorated experts
can't crack that one.

586
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,929
The most plausible theory is that
they chose places on Earth

587
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,968
with the lowest incidence
of lightning strikes.

588
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,643
But there are exceptions.

589
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,247
The next most plausible theory is that
Sheena Easton had a hit song

590
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,529
at each of these sites in 1980.
So, we just don't know.

591
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,448
How do they communicate?

592
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,480
Here, Louise is putting us all to shame.

593
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:01,727
The first breakthrough was to discover
that there's no correlation

594
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,049
between what a heptapod says
and what a heptapod writes.

595
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:25,842
Unlike all written human languages,
their writing is semasiographic.

596
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,288
It conveys meaning.
It doesn't represent sound.

597
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:38,365
Perhaps they view our form of writing
as a wasted opportunity,

598
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,801
passing up a second
communications channel.

599
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,164
We have our friends in Pakistan

600
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,450
to thank for their study
of how heptapods write.

601
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:56,730
Because, unlike speech,
a logogram is free of time.

602
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,846
Like their ship or their bodies,

603
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,129
their written language has
no forward or backward direction.

604
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,963
Linguists call this
"nonlinear orthography,"

605
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,487
which raises the question,
"Is this how they think?"

606
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,285
Imagine you wanted to
write a sentence using two hands,

607
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,089
starting from either side.

608
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,765
You would have to know
each word you wanted to use

609
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,724
as well as
how much space that it would occupy.

610
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,768
A heptapod can write a complex sentence

611
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,968
in two seconds, effortlessly.

612
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,771
It's taken us a month to make
the simplest reply.

613
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,245
Next, expanding vocabulary.

614
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,449
Louise thinks it could easily take
another month to be ready for that.

615
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,327
Hey.

616
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,887
Hey.

617
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,849
Weber's looking for you.

618
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,525
Yeah, well, why do you think
I'm hiding out here?

619
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,240
Come on up.

620
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,241
Come on.

621
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,401
Thanks.

622
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,125
Nice out here, huh?

623
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,804
Yeah, it's a nice view.

624
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,284
Away from the noise.

625
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,768
You know, I was just thinking about you.

626
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,568
You approach language
like a mathematician.

627
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,210
You know that, right?

628
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,362
I will take that as a compliment.

629
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:41,841
Yeah, well, it is.

630
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,446
It's...

631
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,210
I watch you steer us around
these communication traps

632
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,248
that I didn't even know existed.

633
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,606
Say what?

634
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,003
I guess that's why I'm single.

635
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,283
Trust me, you can understand communication

636
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,089
and still end up single.

637
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,842
I feel like
everything that happens in there

638
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,127
comes down to the two of us.

639
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:21,201
Yeah, it's a good thing though, right?
You and I?

640
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,684
Have you seen the jokers
that we're working with?

641
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,324
I'm glad I got you.

642
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,929
Tonight, the first photograph
of the aliens goes viral.

643
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,286
Biological contamination is
a major risk factor at the Montana site,

644
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,687
so say environmental pressure groups.

645
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,842
Eight-hundred thousand march on Washington

646
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,570
to protest
the government's handling of the crisis.

647
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,246
All this, and more special coverage.

648
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,487
First contact with whoever it is
that is inside that thing,

649
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,449
and who do we have running the show?
The government.

650
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,488
That's right, folks. The same government

651
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,325
who ruined our healthcare
and bankrupted our military.

652
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,401
Look at these people.

653
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,369
Most of them don't even have guns.

654
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,728
We could be facing a full-scale invasion,

655
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,723
and our president
is just willing to sit back

656
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,723
and let them waltz in
and take our country.

657
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,201
We are falling asleep
at the wheel, people.

658
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,169
You know what I'm talking about.
I know you do.

659
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,527
What if the smartest thing
we could do right now

660
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,648
would be to give them a show of force?

661
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,802
I'm talking about a shot across the bow

662
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,881
I wanna hear what you think.

663
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,611
Caller number one, you're on the air.
What do you think about all this?

664
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,805
What's this word?

665
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,286
"Planet."

666
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,286
No, no.

667
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,003
That's, like... The Earth is a planet.

668
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,924
Want to see my project
from Miss Garriott's class?

669
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,331
Yeah, little nose.

670
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,888
We had to make up our own TV show.

671
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,171
If we had one.

672
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,561
- And who are those two people?
- That's you and Dad.

673
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:49,325
The show is called
Mommy and Daddy Talk to Animals.

674
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,210
Well, it's lovely.

675
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:58,766
Okay.

676
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,922
You know it's okay to be sad
that your dad and I...

677
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,604
I know. I'm not.

678
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,729
'Cause we both love you very much.

679
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,770
I know. It's just a cartoon. Not real.

680
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,041
Louise?

681
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,851
You all right?

682
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,206
Yeah.

683
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,051
Yeah, I'm fine.

684
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:31,046
I'm not sure it's something I can explain.

685
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,521
When was your last checkup
with Dr. Kettler?

686
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,486
I'm okay.

687
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,770
I'm gonna get some air.

688
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,561
I'm okay.

689
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,244
- All right.
- I'm fine. Yeah.

690
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,965
How you feeling?

691
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,648
I need some sleep, but I'm fine.

692
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:52,961
Yeah.

693
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,967
You know, I was doing some reading
about this idea that

694
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,121
if you immerse yourself
into a foreign language,

695
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,930
that you can actually rewire your brain.

696
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,446
Yeah, the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis.

697
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,960
The theory that...

698
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,722
It's the theory that

699
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:15,407
the language you speak
determines how you think and...

700
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,643
Yeah. It affects how you see everything.
It was...

701
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,085
I'm curious,

702
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,322
are you dreaming in their language?

703
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:36,006
I may have had a few dreams,
but I don't...

704
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,367
I don't think that
that makes me unfit to do this job.

705
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:01,761
Did you sleep?

706
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,646
A little.

707
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,686
Do you know Mandarin?

708
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,525
It is shifting.

709
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,562
The voice you're about to hear
belongs to China's military chief,

710
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,811
General Shang.

711
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,125
Pull it up.

712
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,042
We got a satellite feed here
of who he's talking to,

713
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,690
if you want to look.

714
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,051
Wait, go back.

715
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,085
Stop.

716
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:46,005
He's saying that each of the 12
is offering advanced technology.

717
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,767
And back again. And play.

718
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:58,211
"Our science team is attempting
to decode the sets."

719
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,922
"Sets." I don't know what that means.

720
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,250
Something about advantage.

721
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,846
"Suits, honor, and flowers."

722
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,360
I don't...

723
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,604
I don't know, that's all.

724
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,842
I don't know what it means either.

725
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,685
An hour ago, China mobilized forces.

726
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,649
And now, Russia is following suit.

727
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,124
Shang's about to start something.

728
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,602
Following suit, "suits".

729
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,330
Suits. Honor. Flowers.

730
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,085
Colonel, those are all
tile sets in mahjong.

731
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,291
God, are they...

732
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,924
Are they using a game
to converse with their heptapods?

733
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,324
Maybe. Why?

734
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,200
Well, let's say that I taught them chess
instead of English.

735
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,044
Every conversation would be a game,

736
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:49,442
every idea expressed
through opposition, victory, defeat.

737
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,646
You see the problem?

738
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:55,050
If all I ever gave you was a hammer...

739
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,571
Everything's a nail.

740
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,602
We need to ask the big question.

741
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,166
Ready or not.

742
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,567
Right, so...

743
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,608
Okay, let me know
what temperature you use, okay?

744
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,531
No, this is the same as before.

745
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,167
- See.
- I...

746
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,325
Yeah, no, but between three and four.

747
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,850
- All right, time to go.
- Okay.

748
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,850
Ninety-six minutes remaining
in the session. Over.

749
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,686
Okay.

750
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:50,961
Heptapod's purpose.

751
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,211
Heptapod purpose. Earth.
What is your purpose?

752
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,966
Do we only have Costello?

753
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,209
Okay. There you are.

754
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,760
What does it say?

755
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,125
"Offer weapon."

756
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,206
But you saw what they wrote.

757
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,610
Using a word they don't fully understand.

758
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,090
- It could be just a request.
- Or a warning.

759
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,207
Enough!

760
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:06,761
Louise?

761
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,528
We don't know if they understand

762
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:12,080
the difference between
a weapon and a tool.

763
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,683
Our language, like our culture, is messy,

764
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,370
and sometimes one can be both.

765
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:20,047
I think it's quite possible that they're
asking us to offer them something,

766
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:23,408
not the other way around,
like the first part of a trade.

767
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,803
So, how do we clarify their intentions
beyond those two words?

768
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,250
Well, I go back in.

769
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,482
Right away, we go back in
and we clear this up.

770
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,641
It's more complicated than that.

771
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:32,881
How is it more complicated than that?

772
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,122
Colonel, the Secretary of Defense
is on the line for you.

773
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,682
We need to sit on this information
till we know what it means.

774
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,250
So, we aren't sharing it with our enemies.

775
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,650
We have to consider the idea

776
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,882
that our visitors are prodding us
to fight among ourselves

777
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,247
until only one faction prevails.

778
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,481
There's no evidence of that.

779
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,925
Sure there is.

780
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,843
Just grab a history book.

781
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,845
The British with India,
the Germans with Rwanda.

782
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,002
They even got a name for it in Hungary.

783
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,166
Yeah.

784
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,525
We're a world with no single leader.

785
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,080
It's impossible to deal with
just one of us.

786
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,844
And with the word "weapon" now...

787
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,920
Halpern.

788
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,201
Yes, sir.

789
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,524
Copy that. Waiting for instructions.

790
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,329
No confirmation yet.

791
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,845
Standing by.

792
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,326
Anything?

793
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,171
What did they say?

794
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,441
China and Russia are off the grid.
They aren't speaking to anyone.

795
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,644
Whatever they learned
in their last session has them spooked.

796
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,641
Yes, sir.

797
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,531
We have orders to do the same.

798
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,801
Wait, these are our allies.

799
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:04,961
Colonel, you can't shut us down.

800
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,769
- Put us on radio silence.
- Do it.

801
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,480
We received a message from the...

802
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,045
Damn it!

803
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,006
We need to be talking to each other.

804
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,606
You wanna talk to them?
Find out what this means.

805
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,049
Base-camp talk is now offline.

806
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:26,010
- All interpreters...
- No confirmation. They're offline.

807
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,050
...stand down
and report to unit coordinators.

808
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,168
We've never re-entered a session before.

809
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:35,925
Look, Louise, trust me, okay?
We've got time.

810
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,889
We've just gotta step on it, all right?

811
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,131
"Use weapon."

812
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,841
This is the alien message

813
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,843
said to have provoked
the Chinese government

814
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,606
to withdraw their scientists
from the international mission today.

815
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,521
In a statement, General Shang said,

816
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,002
"China no longer trusts the aliens
who want to divide us.

817
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,570
"Humanity must be protected."

818
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:59,244
China has asked for immediate talks
at the UN.

819
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,051
Alpha one-niner, this is Condor. Over.

820
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,206
Alpha one-niner, this is Condor.

821
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:13,805
Come in. Over.

822
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,324
Captain Marks, Condor.

823
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,563
Not receiving transmission.
Squelch twice if you hear mine.

824
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,163
Captain Marks, all escort groups
are ordered to cease all activity.

825
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,242
No, no, no.
Dr. Banks, you can't go in there.

826
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,646
We just need to ask one question.

827
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:06,008
Dr. Banks, the session is finished.
You can't...

828
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,610
You can't go back in. It's dangerous.

829
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,409
Look, we just need five minutes.
Don't sweat it.

830
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,448
Marks, let them go.

831
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,044
Hey, Abbott.

832
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:24,210
So, what are we calling this, session 37?

833
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,290
No, 36, part two.

834
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,526
Okay.

835
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,041
Yeah.

836
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,881
Why they on their own?

837
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,928
We've been attempting
to hail Captain Marks.

838
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,809
The escort units are not responding, sir.

839
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:40,881
Why not?

840
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,571
Send security.

841
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:50,287
"Offer weapon. Question mark."

842
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,447
Are you offering us something?

843
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,131
"Technology. Apparatus. Method"?

844
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,688
Yeah, see, this is a different word.

845
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,240
This segment, it's a lot busier.

846
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,086
"Give.

847
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,451
"Technology.

848
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,081
"Now."

849
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,444
What's he doing?

850
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,610
Captain, on your 10.

851
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,651
Mutineers are to be apprehended
without engaging.

852
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,525
We don't want to risk
antagonizing our visitors. Over.

853
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,489
Security detail inbound, sir.
T-minus four minutes remaining.

854
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,170
We need to see this through.

855
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,930
Okay, this is it. Lock and load.

856
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,923
We just need to hold them off
until it's done.

857
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,526
Copy that. Warning shots
and suppressive fire only.

858
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,840
Load up and get to cover.

859
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,843
Stay fresh and we can avoid casualties.

860
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,531
Abbott wants me to write on the barrier.

861
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,845
Can you even do that?

862
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,885
I don't know.

863
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,685
I can't do it with both hands.

864
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:17,761
Louise.

865
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,161
What is that?

866
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,971
- Free fire!
- Over there! I'm hit! I'm hit!

867
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,686
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

868
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,250
You suffered a concussion.

869
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,845
Just lay back.

870
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,124
How are you feeling?

871
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,165
How is Ian?

872
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,203
Same as you. He's okay.

873
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,001
Who...

874
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,930
Who did this?

875
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,045
Some soldiers. Been watching too much TV.

876
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,285
What is that?

877
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,442
Now, take it easy. Take it easy.

878
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,284
The site's no longer secure.

879
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,930
We're standing by to evacuate.

880
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,486
Where's Ian?

881
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,650
Weber came and got him
maybe 10 minutes ago.

882
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,724
But he wouldn't leave
until he knew you were okay.

883
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,804
The whole tent is on the clock

884
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:16,611
to figure out whatever it is
you were given up there.

885
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,524
This is all of it.

886
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,644
The feed wasn't interrupted
by the explosion?

887
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,882
Not as far as we can see.

888
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,164
You see something?

889
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,480
I don't know yet.

890
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,484
I'm gonna need my team
to get together with Louise's team.

891
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:38,890
I need everybody working on this.

892
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:39,961
We cannot leave.

893
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,046
Glad to see you're awake.

894
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:44,885
We need to go back in and we need
to explain to them this wasn't our fault.

895
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,008
- We can't go back inside.
- We have to tell them... We have to.

896
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,168
What happened in there was an attack.

897
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:52,164
We can hope for the best, but
I have orders to prepare for retaliation.

898
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:53,526
We may have to evacuate.

899
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,491
No, that's the wrong move.
As long as they stay, we have to stay.

900
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,442
Well, they're not leaving.

901
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,281
Why does this feel worse?

902
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,683
China is on the offensive.

903
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:47,041
They're positioning their military to blow
the alien vessel right out of the sky.

904
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,450
And if this happens,

905
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:53,208
we can't sit around waiting
for retaliation, so get prepared.

906
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,328
The Air Force and infantry
are standing by.

907
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,401
Yes, sir.

908
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:01,289
Tonight, China becomes
the first world power

909
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,601
to declare war against the aliens.

910
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:08,047
Following the failure of
diplomatic efforts at the United Nations,

911
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:11,488
China has confirmed that
its language experts have, tonight,

912
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,604
delivered an ultimatum
at the Shanghai site.

913
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,808
In a televised statement, General Shang,

914
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,042
Chairman of the People's Liberation Army,

915
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,806
said the aliens have 24 hours
to leave Chinese territory

916
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,564
or face destruction.

917
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,849
And he urged all other world leaders
to unite with China

918
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,446
and take a similar stance.

919
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:33,888
With a huge buildup of forces
at their landing sites,

920
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:39,046
Pakistan, Russia, and Sudan are
thought to be following China's lead.

921
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:56,608
It can't be random.

922
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,122
It's going to take us years.

923
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,089
What's this term here?

924
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:26,411
Mom.

925
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,521
Mom.

926
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,166
Sweetie?

927
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:34,686
What's this term for that thing like a...

928
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:35,966
Like a technical term?

929
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:40,048
Where we make a deal and
we both get something out of it?

930
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:41,690
"Compromise."

931
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,886
No.

932
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:48,441
Like, it's a competition,
but both sides end up happy.

933
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,206
Like a win-win.

934
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,445
More science-y than that.

935
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,487
If you want science, call your father.

936
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,451
Thank you.

937
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,485
Sorry.

938
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,281
It's okay. I'm up.

939
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:33,884
What time is it?

940
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:38,289
It's time you open that bottle
you've been hiding.

941
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:44,161
You cracked something, didn't you?

942
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,446
Yeah, come here.

943
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,011
Take a look at this section.

944
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,528
It seems to be talking about time.

945
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:55,002
Their symbol for "time" is everywhere.

946
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:56,730
So, what is this?

947
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:00,729
A formula for faster-than-light travel?

948
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,165
Who can tell?

949
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,570
There are too many gaps.

950
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:05,846
Nothing's complete.

951
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,605
Then it dawned on me.

952
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,011
Come here.

953
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,001
Right here.

954
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:16,244
Stop focusing on the ones,
look at the zeroes.

955
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,529
How much of this is data?
How much of it is negative space?

956
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,769
So, I measured it.

957
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:26,204
0.0833 recurring.

958
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:35,127
Perhaps you'd like that as a fraction.

959
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,203
One of 12.

960
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:46,290
What they're saying right here
is that this is one of 12.

961
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:48,569
We are part of a larger whole.

962
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,404
Or we're one of 12 contestants
for the prize.

963
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,641
Why do I have to talk to him?

964
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,370
We're all working together here.

965
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,124
We need to talk to the other sites.

966
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,810
We need to help them with what they've
gotten from the other heptapods.

967
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,609
In case you don't remember,
we're blacked out.

968
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,610
China just threatened to destroy
their shell. We're on our own.

969
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,489
Yeah, but this says that
all of the pieces fit together.

970
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,006
And I'm telling you that
no one else cares.

971
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,489
Two hours ago, we pulled this audio
off a secure channel in Russia.

972
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,530
Someone on the science team there
was broadcasting wide.

973
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,163
In their final session, the alien said,
"There is no time.

974
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:22,481
"Many become one."

975
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,250
I feel we have all been given weapons.

976
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:28,089
If anyone is receiving this, please...

977
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,528
Well, I mean,

978
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,610
there are a lot of ways
you can interpret what he's saying.

979
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,682
I don't need an interpreter
to know what this means.

980
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,762
Russia just executed
one of their own experts

981
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,171
to keep their secrets.

982
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,766
"Many become one" could
just be their way of saying,

983
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,530
"Some assembly required."

984
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,602
Why hand it out to us in pieces?

985
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,205
Why not just give it all over?

986
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,521
Well, what better way to force us
to work together for once?

987
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,644
Even if I did believe you,

988
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,240
how in the world you gonna get
anybody else to play along

989
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:01,731
or give up their data?

990
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,848
We offer ours in return.

991
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:06,607
Yeah?

992
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:08,205
What, trade?

993
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,645
It's a non-zero sum game.

994
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:13,805
"Non-zero sum game."

995
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,200
That's it.

996
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:19,049
Yeah, thanks.

997
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:29,881
Nine of the landing sites
have gone total comms blackout.

998
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,480
Only way to reach them
is to physically drive there and yell

999
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,210
at the border guards, which we're doing,
but it won't be fast enough.

1000
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,806
There's got to be a way to...
To get the message to them.

1001
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:40,804
To our allies maybe, but at this stage,
it's too little too late.

1002
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:43,724
What we need is to get
all the other nations online

1003
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:45,529
before one starts global war,

1004
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,688
and there's no way for us to reach them.

1005
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,250
Wait. Hold on a second.

1006
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:50,560
There is.

1007
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,169
It's right above us.

1008
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,609
That's problematic for us right now.

1009
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:58,930
The Pentagon's convinced
our shell will retaliate.

1010
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,209
My guess is they'll order us
to evacuate within the hour.

1011
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,010
Look, they're not our enemy.

1012
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,809
They've made
no act of aggression towards us.

1013
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,848
Maybe this is
their way of being aggressive.

1014
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,843
That's not the question.

1015
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,002
Well, what is the question?

1016
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,609
How do we get you back in that room
when it's half a mile straight up?

1017
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:17,250
I think our work here is done.

1018
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:20,686
It's in the hands of our superiors now.

1019
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,088
What the hell is she doing?

1020
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:39,886
No. God. Oh, God. No.

1021
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,000
Costello?

1022
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,570
Where's Abbott?

1023
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,531
I'm sorry.

1024
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,964
We're sorry.

1025
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,484
I need you to...

1026
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:51,083
I need you to send a message
to the other sites.

1027
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:11,880
I don't...

1028
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,005
I don't understand.

1029
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:17,769
What is your purpose here?

1030
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:47,002
How can you know the future?

1031
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,211
I don't...

1032
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:08,045
I don't understand.

1033
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,162
Who is this child?

1034
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,322
The show is called
Mommy and Daddy Talk to Animals.

1035
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:54,921
Wait.

1036
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,088
No... Wait!

1037
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:47,804
- Dr. Banks!
- Louise!

1038
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:49,564
Are you all right?

1039
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,400
- Hey. You all right?
- Yeah.

1040
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,164
- Here, come on. What happened?
- I'm fine.

1041
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:58,004
Tried to figure it out. This is too big.

1042
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,890
Doesn't matter now.
We have orders to evacuate.

1043
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:04,760
- Why?
- Russia and Sudan are following China.

1044
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:08,322
Ian. I don't understand why the...

1045
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:09,640
Help me, Mama.

1046
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:12,080
Louise?

1047
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:13,400
Oh, my God.

1048
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:14,845
Mom.

1049
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,205
Mama!

1050
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:22,765
Sorry, honey.

1051
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:28,601
What day is it? Do you know, baby?

1052
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:29,920
Sunday.

1053
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:38,126
Are you gonna leave me like Daddy did?

1054
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:42,484
Hannah, honey,
your daddy didn't leave you.

1055
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:45,040
You're gonna see him this weekend.

1056
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,605
He doesn't look at me
the same way anymore.

1057
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,724
That's my fault.

1058
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,890
I told him something
that he wasn't ready to hear.

1059
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:07,246
What?

1060
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:13,807
Well, believe it or not,

1061
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:16,565
I know something that's going to happen.

1062
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:21,405
I can't explain how I know. I just do.

1063
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:25,924
And when I told your daddy,
he got really mad.

1064
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:30,685
And he said I made the wrong choice.

1065
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:35,447
What? What's going to happen?

1066
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:42,281
It has to do with a really rare disease.

1067
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,443
And it's unstoppable.

1068
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,603
Kind of like you are.

1069
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:55,568
Your swimming, and your poetry,

1070
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:58,928
and all the other amazing things
that you share with the world.

1071
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,329
I am unstoppable?

1072
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:03,446
Yeah.

1073
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:21,645
I got you.

1074
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:24,925
Louise?

1075
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:27,085
Louise.

1076
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:31,046
I just realized why my husband left me.

1077
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:32,685
My husband left me.

1078
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,569
You were married?

1079
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:36,881
Come on. Let's get out of here.

1080
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:12,766
Mama?

1081
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,001
Yeah?

1082
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,648
Why is my name Hannah?

1083
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:18,810
Yeah, got it right here.

1084
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:20,723
Get those people back, please.

1085
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:26,810
Well, your name is very special
because it is a palindrome.

1086
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,168
It reads the same forward and backward.

1087
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:33,086
- All right, guys, give me a hand here.
- Yes, sir.

1088
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,161
That goes in the back.

1089
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:52,370
Civilian contractors must have their
authorization badges

1090
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:53,930
and passkeys when checking...

1091
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:03,566
Evacuation underway...

1092
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:08,166
Hey.

1093
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:10,968
Look, we're done here.

1094
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,201
We're taking this with us.

1095
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:38,810
I can read it.

1096
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:44,769
- I know what it is.
- What?

1097
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:46,922
It's not a weapon, it's a gift.

1098
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:49,484
The weapon is their language.

1099
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:51,608
They gave it all to us.
Do you understand what that means?

1100
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:54,725
So we can learn Heptapod, if we survive.

1101
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:57,690
If you learn it, when you really learn it,

1102
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,922
you begin to perceive time
the way that they do.

1103
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:02,890
So you can see what's to come.

1104
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,122
But time, it isn't the same for them.

1105
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:07,482
- It's non-linear.
- Look.

1106
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:10,087
We did our best, but it wasn't enough.

1107
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:13,004
The captain will load you up.

1108
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:14,525
You're lifting off in five minutes.

1109
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:18,647
Ian, Louise,
it was an honor to work with ya.

1110
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:21,165
Good luck.

1111
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:25,845
Hey, Colonel!

1112
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,530
I'm gonna find out where we're going.

1113
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:45,041
Wake up, Mommy.

1114
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,050
Dr. Banks.

1115
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:24,605
A pleasure.

1116
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:26,326
General Shang.

1117
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:27,970
The pleasure is mine, really.

1118
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:30,968
Your President said

1119
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:34,328
he was honored to host me
at the celebration...

1120
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,402
- Yes.
- ...but I confess,

1121
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:39,891
the only reason why I'm here is to

1122
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:43,368
meet you in person.

1123
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:46,681
Me? Well, I'm flattered. Thank you.

1124
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:50,127
Now, 18 months ago,

1125
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:52,248
you did something remarkable.

1126
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:56,367
Something not even my superior has done.

1127
01:39:58,240 --> 01:39:59,844
And what's that?

1128
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:01,843
You changed my mind.

1129
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:07,726
You're the reason for this unification.

1130
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:12,400
All because you reached out to me
on my private number.

1131
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:15,481
Your private number.

1132
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:18,086
General, I don't know your private number.

1133
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,124
Now you know.

1134
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:31,766
I do not claim to know
how your mind works,

1135
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:37,047
but I believe it was important for you
to see that.

1136
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:40,005
I called you, didn't I?

1137
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,647
Yes, you did.

1138
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:55,966
Louise.

1139
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:15,000
- All right, let's shut down the system.
- Sir.

1140
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:18,761
There's a sat-line here dialing China.

1141
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:22,485
Here? What do you mean "here"?

1142
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,445
Come on, come on.

1143
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:29,285
Whose phone is it?

1144
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:34,601
It's your phone, sir.

1145
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:43,566
Search base camp now.

1146
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,843
Find out who's using that phone.

1147
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:48,841
- Hold on to those coordinates.
- Yes, sir.

1148
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:51,446
Come on. What'd I say?

1149
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:55,489
What'd I say? Come on.

1150
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:06,051
Come on.

1151
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:09,971
I will never forget what you said.

1152
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:23,649
You told me my wife's dying words.

1153
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,850
Found the source of the phone call.

1154
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:44,888
It's in the clean room.
Waiting for instructions.

1155
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:49,529
What are you doing?

1156
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:52,043
- What are you doing?
- Changing someone's mind.

1157
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:54,043
- Can you buy me 20 seconds?
- We don't have time for this right now.

1158
01:42:54,120 --> 01:42:56,168
No, trust me, buy me 20 seconds.
Do you trust me?

1159
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:57,685
- Okay! Yeah.
- You trust me?

1160
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,081
Dr. Banks!

1161
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:04,570
Drop the phone now or we shoot!

1162
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:10,286
- Drop it!
- Yeah. I'm sorry!

1163
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:14,649
You're committing an act of treason!

1164
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,771
- Yes.
- Drop it!

1165
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:23,450
It's done. I'm done.

1166
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:43,050
Communications blackout from all 12
landing sites continues this evening.

1167
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:45,849
Hold on, we are just hearing...

1168
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,921
And I'm being told

1169
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,685
we're going to cut this report
to tell you breaking news.

1170
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,445
Breaking now, China has called
an emergency press conference.

1171
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:55,729
General Shang, Commander-in-chief
of the People's Liberation Army,

1172
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:58,041
has announced in
an emergency press conference

1173
01:43:58,120 --> 01:43:59,804
that China is standing down.

1174
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:02,890
China is stating that
all intelligence they have received

1175
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:05,440
will be shared immediately
with all the other landing sites.

1176
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:08,000
Scientists from around the world
are sifting through information received

1177
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:09,410
- from the UK, Japan...
- Breaking news,

1178
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:11,767
the Russian armed forces are now
revealing the information

1179
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:14,081
they've acquired from
both of their landing sites

1180
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:16,242
and have declared the Black Sea
a demilitarized zone.

1181
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,846
...one of the 12 pieces of this puzzle
that's being slowly put together.

1182
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:11,045
So, Hannah.

1183
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:14,925
This is where your story begins.

1184
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:18,969
The day they departed.

1185
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,530
You all right?

1186
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:31,970
Despite knowing the journey
and where it leads,

1187
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:37,004
I embrace it,

1188
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:42,842
and I welcome every moment of it.

1189
01:46:57,480 --> 01:47:02,008
- H-A-N-N-A-H.
- H-A-N-N-A-H.

1190
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:21,125
- Now backward. H-A-N-N-A-H.
- A-N-N-A-H.

1191
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,690
Hannah.

1192
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:24,330
You ready, baby?

1193
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:26,561
Okay.

1194
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:28,521
Hi.

1195
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:33,282
- You good?
- All right. See ya.

1196
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:36,371
Daddy!

1197
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:46,806
You okay?

1198
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,291
Daddy's gonna roll over you.

1199
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:52,964
All right, you ready?

1200
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:58,651
Guess what? Star stuff.

1201
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:03,562
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1202
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:07,643
If you could see your whole life
from the start to finish,

1203
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:12,207
would you change things?

1204
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:21,846
Maybe I'd say what I feel more often.

1205
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:23,365
I... I don't know.

1206
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:43,563
You know, I've had my head tilted up to
the stars for as long as I can remember.

1207
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:48,247
You know what surprised me the most?

1208
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:52,402
It wasn't meeting them.

1209
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:58,884
It was meeting you.

1210
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:42,802
I forgot how good it felt
to be held by you.

1211
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:54,123
You wanna make a baby?

1212
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:29,886
Yes.

1213
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:31,281
Yeah.
