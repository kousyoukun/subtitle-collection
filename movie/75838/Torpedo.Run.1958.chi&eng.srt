27
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,699
船长很苦恼啊
Pretty rough on the skipper.

28
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:23,835
当然 有没有他家人的消息
Sure is. Has he heard anything about his family?

29
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,772
自日本人入侵马尼拉后 就音信全无
Not a word since the Japanese invaded Manila.

44
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,152
你不介意吧
You don't mind, do you?

45
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:19,157
现在分给大家
Now some for everybody.

46
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:21,059
泰瑞莎 等他们吃完后

47
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:23,629
马上把他们带进去拆礼物
take them inside and start opening the presents.

48

50
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,237
你要抱一下吗
You want to hold it?

51
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:44,583
很棒的派对 我们玩得很开心
Well, it was a very nice party and we enjoyed being here.

52
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,118
你们这是要去哪儿
Where do you think you're going?

53
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,120
我们必须得回基地去
Well, we have to get back to the base.

54
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:49,321
什么
What?

55
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,023
不 不会吧
Oh, no, you don't.

56
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,991
你和阿奇在这个月的演习中
You and Arch have sunk the whole enemy fleet

57
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,826
击沉整个敌方舰队五次

Six, honey, six!

59
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,497
我不算一天两次的记录
I wasn't counting doubleheaders.

60
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,098
我今早刚接到报告
I just got word this morning

61
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,000
日本人的 “士那若” 号 开始启用
they've commissioned the<i>Shinaru.</i>

62
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,869
是他们最新的航空母舰吗 巴尼
Their newest carrier, is that straight dope, Barney?

63
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,804
是 我为了这才迟到
That's why I was late.

64
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:09,041
你应该给他们留一艘航母去参加真正的战争
You ought to leave them one carrier for the real war.

65
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,410
阿奇
Arch...

66
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,012
你可以用这个来捞“士那若”的碎片给我
you can bring me back a piece of the<i>Shinaru</i>in this.

67
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,349
今天下午我们要去钓鱼
This afternoon we're going fishing.

68
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:19,017
好吧 听你的
Well, if you say so.

69
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:21,653
要是去钓鱼的话 得先培养点情绪
Well, if we're going fishing let's get in the mood.

70
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,390
有道理
Fair enough.

71
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,995
干杯
Cheers.

72

普里莫 我说过 道尔上校的电话
Primo, I told you, no telephone calls

75
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,207
今天一律不接
for Commander Doyle today.

76

海军基地来的 非常紧急

他们一定要跟道尔上校通话
They have to talk to Commander Doyle,

78
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,747
是有关珍珠港的事
something about Pearl Harbor.

79
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,692
怎么回事
What was that about?

80
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:01,960
哦 基地说有很重要的事
Oh, the base said it was important,

81
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,895
有关珍珠港的
something about Pearl Harbor.

82
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,732
简 我要你带迪迪
Jane, I want you to take Dede and get out of Manila

83
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,667
尽快离开马尼拉
just as quick as you can.

84
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:11,269
哦 巴尼 你又来了
Oh, Barney, now not that again.

85
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,739
马尼拉是我的故乡 我生长在此
Manila is my home, I was born here and--

86
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,174
而它现在是我们的家
and now it's our home.

87
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:19,344
你和我一样明白 这里将会发生什么
You know as well as I do what can happen here.

88
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,812
你很清楚知道接下来会发生什么 不是吗
You know what's coming now, don't you?

89
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,547
是的 我知道
Yes, I know.

90
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:26,051
如果菲律宾群岛被日本人入侵 我会带着泰瑞莎
But if these islands are invaded, I'll take Teresa,

91
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,520
普里莫和迪迪 躲到山里去
Primo, Dede, we'll go up in the hills

92
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,489
直到等你回来
and we'll be waiting for you there.

93
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,725
拜托亲爱的 求你了 别破坏她的生日
Come on, darling, please let's not spoil her birthday.

94
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,696
好吧
All right.

95
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,164
我得先跟基地联系一下
I want to call the base first.

96
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,853
(模拟电动机)
(imitating motor)

97
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,488
(笑)
(laughter)

98
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:04,956
很肥胖的油轮 船长
Nice big fat tanker, sir.

99
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,792
还可以加入更多记录
Plenty of room on that, sir.

100
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,198
把那个网兜丢了
Throw that net away.

101
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:17,235
什么意思 把它丢了
What do you mean throw it away?

102
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,804
那是我的
That's mine.

103
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,976
我们别再自欺欺人了
Let's quit kidding ourselves, huh?

104
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,813
马尼拉在十个月前就被占领了
Manila was captured 10 months ago.

105
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:32,651
但这并不能证明简被抓了
That doesn't prove that Jane was captured.

106
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,786
丢掉它
Throw it away.

107
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:38,056
巴尼 简会照顾好自己的
Barney, Jane knows what she's doing.

108
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,991
她很可能藏在山里的某个地方了
She's probably hiding out in the hills somewhere.

109
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,060
只要她能跟潜艇基地联系上
As soon as she can get word to ComSubPac,

110
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,628
他们马上就会联络我们 相信我
they'll let us know, believe me.

111
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,197
我说了把它丢了
I said throw it away!

112
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:47,799
是 长官
Yes, sir.

113
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:57,476
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:02,280
我们就像两个小孩子似的 对着彼此叫嚷
We're like a couple of kids yelling at each other.

115
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,119
请你喝杯咖啡吧
Let me buy you some coffee, huh?

116
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,589
艾尔 来点咖啡
Al, bring us some coffee, will you?

117
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,890
是 长官
Aye aye, sir.

118
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,562
他太紧张了
He's too tense.

119
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:18,997
是
Yeah.

120
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,799
但他的紧张并没有影响到他
Well, he wasn't too tense to get those.

121
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,701
我愿意做他的手下
Well, I'll ride with him.

122
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:23,969
你真大方
That's big of you.

123
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,270
如果你不愿意的话 你会在哪儿下船
Where would you get off?

124
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:38,550
雷达侦察出 方位256度 有陆地
I have a radar contact landmass bearing 256.

125
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,218
256度
256?

126
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,155
找到了
Got her.

127
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,790
船长请到指挥舱
Captain to the conning tower.

128
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,225
船长请到指挥舱
Captain to the conning tower.

129
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,107
看到陆地 长官
Land contact, sir.

130
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:04,809
我们的位置在哪儿
What's our position?

131
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,111
富士山
Good old Fujiyama.

132
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,280
我们又回家了 船长
Well, we're home again, captain.

133
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:09,414
嗯
Yeah.

134
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,921
我们距离海岸一英里半 方位273
Land is one half miles off, sir, bearing 273,

135
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,455
我们在骏河湾(日本最深的海湾)的入口
we're in the mouth of Suruga Bay.

136
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:21,026
中尉 你离英国家乡可很远了
Well, you're a long way from England, lieutenant.

137
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,827
这就是无知的好处 先生
That's the advantage of ignorance, sir.

138
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,765
我是由英国皇家海军派遣到美国海军

声纳还未连接

154
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,739
也许日本人在这附近有潜水艇 费舍尔
The Japs could have a submarine here, Fisher.

155
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:10,442
是 有可能 抱歉 船长
That's right, I guess they could. I'm sorry, captain.

156
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,580
声纳没有反应
No contact on sonar, sir.

157

福利 是
Mr. Foley? Yes, sir?

162
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,515
你今天是甲板值班吗
You are the officer of the deck, aren't you?

163
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,517
是 长官 那你应该知道 值班军官
Yes, sir. Then you know that the OD

164
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:53,952
不该是最后一个上甲板的人

165
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,754
是 长官
Yes, sir.

166
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,197
目测前方有帆船

距离船首左舷10度

168
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,302
可能是艘巡逻船
It's probably a picket boat.

169
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,871
让它回去报告
Let him send back a report,

170
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,339
也许他们会派个大目标出来

171
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:18,943
你还没有找到吗 福利

173
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:25,150
很抱歉 我上甲板迟了
Sorry about being late to the bridge, sir.

174
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,751
抱歉是个用在葬礼上的词
Sorry is a word for funerals.

175
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:30,021
你到底迟到了多久 福利
How late were you, Mr. Foley?

176
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,324
大约十秒钟 十秒
About 10 seconds. Ten seconds?

177
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,560
你应该知道鱼雷的时速是50英里
Well, I'm sure that you realize a torpedo traveling

178
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:39,397
十秒之内就可到达1/7英里
at 50 knots makes 1/7 of a mile in 10 seconds?

179
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,666
是 长官 以后绝不会再发生了 长官
Yes, sir. Won't happen again, sir.

180
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,506
船长 我们喝点咖啡吧
Say, cap, how about having some coffee?

181
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,480
好主意
That's a good idea.

182
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,552
福利 现在由你负责甲板了
Now that you have the deck, Mr. Foley...

是 长官
Yes, sir.

184
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,088
好好干
Take care of it, huh?

185
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,522
谢谢 长官
Thank you, sir.

186
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,499
(敲门)
(knocking on door)

187
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,838
好消息 将军
Great news, admiral.

188
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,339
“士那若”号吗
The<i>Shinaru?</i>

189
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,941
不 先生 连个影子都没有
No, sir, not a trace.

190
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,409
五个地区都未发现
Negative in five areas

191
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:26,010
其他区还未报告 长官
but others haven't called in yet, sir.

192
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,612
你有什么好消息
What is your great news?

193
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:30,181
新的美国平民战俘名单
New list, sir. Confirmed by the Swedish legation

194
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,550
由瑞典大使馆确认
of American civilian prisoners of war.

195
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,819
亚当上校 这里是作战指挥部
Commander Adams, this is an operational office.

196
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,223
长官 在两个星期前
Sir, as of 2 weeks ago,

197
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,726
巴尼・道尔的太太和孩子都还活着 他们平安无事
Barney Doyle's wife and baby are alive and well.

198
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:43,428
在哪儿
Where?

199
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:46,564
在克拉博收容中心 你确定
The internment camp at Callabo. Are you sure?

200
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:49,334
瑞典人的报告一向非常可靠
The Swedish reports have been very reliable, sir.

201
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,703
对 没错
Yes, they have.

202
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,505
马上把消息通知给巴尼
Crack it off to Barney as soon as you can raise him.

203
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,240
一定要赶快联系上
Get it through and make it move.

204
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,275
是 长官
Yes, sir.

205
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,045
亚当
Adams!

206
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,580
长官
Sir?

207
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,482
为什么敌人要现在告诉我们
Why are the enemy telling us this now?

208
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:07,685
瑞典人几周来一直在努力尝试 长官
Well, the Swedes have been trying for weeks, sir.

209
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:08,853
你知道敌人是怎样的
You know how the enemy is.

210
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,589
就是这个
That's it.

211
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,224
我不明白 长官
Don't follow, sir.

212
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,726
他们放出来的任何消息
When they tell us anything,

213
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,028
就是想要 让我们知道
it's because they want us to know.

214
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:19,063
说得也是 长官
That's true, sir.

215
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,300
为什么在这么多个月之后 为什么要等到现在
Why after all these months? Why now?

216
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,836
我不明白 长官
I don't know, sir.

217
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,371
我也不明白
Neither do I.

218
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,307
我应不应该压下这个消息
Shall I hold this information, sir?

219
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:32,844
不 巴尼有权知道
No, Barney has a right to know.

220
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,379
是 长官
Aye aye, sir.

221
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,986
安全无事
"Alive and well!"

222
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,122
谁 是谁 是谁
Who? Who? Who?

223
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,423
什么 安全无事
What? Alive and well!

224
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,791
谁安全无事
Who's alive and well?

225
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,059
船长的太太和孩子
Captain's wife and baby!

226
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:50,829
(模糊地唠叨)太好了
(indistinct chattering)

227
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,400
我不是说过了吗
Didn't I tell you?

228
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,335
现在只缺找到“士那若”号了
Now all we need is a piece of the<i>Shinaru!</i>

229
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:59,470
别忘了 那个克拉博收容中心 仍是个俘虏收容所
That Callabo is still an internment camp.

230
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,539
但那是眼下最安全的地方 巴尼
But it's the safest place in the war, Barney.

231
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,675
希望如此
We hope.

232
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,877
你还想请假吗
Well, you still want to get rest?

233
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:08,046
请假 现在 哈
Rest? Now? Ha!

234
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,380
作战指挥部有什么命令
What about that operational stuff?

235
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:10,882
他们要我们准备好
We're alerted to stand by,

236
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:13,251
随时应对紧急情况
surface for something urgent from ComSubPac.

237
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,520
你听到了 好
Well, you heard him. Right.

238
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,424
(敲门)
(knocking on door)

239
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,903
亚当 你怎么了
Adams, what's the matter with you?

240
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:33,137
哦 我很好 长官
Oh, I'm fine, sir.

241
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,806
见到鬼了
Seen a ghost?

242
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,241
是“士那若”号 长官
The<i>Shinaru</i>, sir.

243
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,543
在哪儿 指给我看
Where? Where, show me.

244
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:43,982
在这里 长官 它正往东北方向移动
Right here, sir, headed northeast.

245
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,218
我们三次准备好了攻击它 但都给它跑了
We've had three good fixes and she outran them all,

246
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,921
很明显它是开往东京湾
obviously headed for Tokyo Bay.

247
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,489
巴尼・道尔和他的
And Barney Doyle.

248
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,324
角鲨号潜艇就守在那儿
The<i>Greyfish</i> is right there.

249
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,461
它跑不了 亚当
He's got her, Adams!

250
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,996
他会抓住机会发射鱼雷
He'll get a shot at her, sir.

251
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,531
用鱼雷 必要时他会撞沉它
Shot? He'll ram her if he has to.

252
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,501
巴尼・道尔是最好的人选
Barney Doyle, if I could have picked my man.

253
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,704
他会朝它直冲过去
She's going right down his throat.

254
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:08,773
这是马上要发给他的吧
This is going out to him, of course.

255
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:11,743
长官 他已经收到作战通报了 但是...
Sir, he's already got the operational data but--

256
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,611
但是什么
But what?

257
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,513
我认为你应该全部看完 长官
I think you ought to read the rest of that, sir.

258
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,889
可恶
Devils.

259
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:30,328
这帮狡猾的恶魔
Those clever devils.

260
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:33,164
恐怕我们收到的那好消息就与此有关 长官
I'm afraid this explains our great news, sir.

261
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,400
大大有关
Too well.

262
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:38,403
巴尼 收到这些消息了吗 没有 长官
Barney got all of this yet? No, sir.

263
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:39,871
我们刚刚才把有关“士那若”号的
He's just getting the operational stuff

264
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,739
行动资料发给他而已
on the<i>Shinaru</i>now.

265
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,308
他们以为中大奖了
They think they've hit the jackpot.

266
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:44,676
哦
Yeah.

267
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:49,847
珍珠港来的消息
Message from Pearl.

268
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,816
大奖到了 长官
The jackpot, sir.

269
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,619
麦凯 是 长官
McKay! Aye, sir.

270
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:56,154
去甲板上换福利下来
Relieve Mr. Foley on the bridge.

271
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:57,722
是 长官
Aye, sir.

272
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:06,864
我们要走捷径到东京湾
Give me the shortest course between here and Tokyo Bay.

273
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,132
东京湾
Tokyo Bay?

274
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,601
是 长官
Yes, sir!

275
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,270
全速前进 全速前进 长官
All ahead full. All ahead full, sir.

276
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:13,404
全速前进
All ahead full.

277
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,806
(电话铃)
(telephone ringing)

278
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,507
全速前进 长官
Answer up, all ahead full, sir.

279
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:19,610
福利 是 长官
Mr. Foley! Yes, sir?

280
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,312
检测一下鱼雷发射装置
Run tests on the torpedo data computer

281
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:22,780
确保它运行良好
to make certain it's operating perfectly.

282
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,949
建议航向 061 长官
Recommended course 061, sir.

283
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,517
很好
Very well.

284
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,319
右转 航向 061
Down right to course 061.

285
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,088
航向 061
061, sir.

286
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:35,560
米利根 准备发报
Mr. Milligan, send this message.

287
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,795
角鲨致作战指挥部
<i> Greyfish</i>to ComSubPac.

288
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,330
我们干
Will do.

289
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:47,672
船长宣布 根据可靠情报
Captain to crew, upon reliable information

290
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:50,108
我们准备拦截“士那若”号
we are moving to intercept the<i>Shinaru.</i>

291
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,712
中大奖了
The jackpot.

292
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:57,048
“士那若”号 没错
The<i>Shinaru?</i> That's right.

293
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,150
嘿 头儿 大家干嘛对“士那若”号
Hey, chief, what's all the excitement

294
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,518
那么大惊小怪
about the<i>Shinaru?</i>

295
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,120
它只是另一艘航母而已
It's just another flattop.

296
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,589
另一艘航母 它是全美海军
Just another flattop? That's the number one target

297
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,424
的头号攻击目标
of the whole United States Navy.

298
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,926
就是它领头 率先攻击了我们的珍珠港
It led the attack against us at Pearl Harbor.

299
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,737
我们的位置非常好 巴尼
Well, that sets us up just great, Barney.

300
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,439
海水也足够深
We've got plenty of depth there too.

301
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,374
船长 作战指挥部又发来个消息
Captain, another message from ComSubPac.

302
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:24,475
阿奇 看下这个
Take it, Arch.

303
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,077
是
Yes, sir.

304
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:27,879
一切正常 长官
Checks out all right, sir.

305
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,647
船长 “士那若”号一定
Captain, the<i>Shinaru</i> will undoubtedly

306
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,083
会有驱逐舰护航的 毫无疑问
have a destroyer screen. Undoubtedly?

307
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:34,352
也许有机会 我们可以打沉它一艘
Well, there might be chance to prang one of them, too.

308
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:35,987
那是当然 不过他们也会这么做
Well, of course they're gonna be doing

309
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:38,089
他们也会想尽办法打沉我们的 中尉
a little pranging of their own, lieutenant.

310
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:39,157
那时一定会很热闹
Yes, it won't be dull.

311
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,258
一定会
I'm sure of that.

312
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:41,859
巴尼 唔
Barney. Huh?

313
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,173
念给大家听
Read it to all hands.

314
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:04,015
这是副艇长替艇长广播
This is the exec speaking for the captain.

315
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:08,386
念一段刚由作战指挥部发来的报告
I'm gonna read you a message just received from ComSubPac.

316
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,121
报告

317
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,723
据已证实的可靠情报
"Information considered reliable here verified screen

322
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,738
继续念
Go ahead.

323
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,909
据进一步的可靠消息
"Further information considered equally reliable

报告结束
End of quote.

329
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,905
我是船长
This is the captain.

330
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:04,375
我想要提醒各位
I will remind every man in this crew

331
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,477
我们的任务 就是要穿透层层防护
that we're trained to penetrate the enemy's

332
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,013
去击中目标
protective screens and shields.

333
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:12,150
巴尼 作战指挥部没要求我们非攻击不可
Barney, ComSubPac didn't say we have to attack.

334
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,752
为什么需要说呢
Why should they?

335
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,154
这就是我们来这儿的目的
That's what we're here for.

336
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:17,655
巴尼
Barney!

337
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,192
我能和你私下谈谈吗
Can I have a word with you?

338
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,864
通知舰桥 我下去了
Notify the bridge I'm going below.

339
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,833
舰桥 船长下去了
Bridge, captain going below.

340
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:40,645
说吧
Well?

341
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:45,716
巴尼 我是穷苦出身
Barney, I came up through the hose pipe.

342
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,485
我曾做过潜艇上的每项工作
I've held every job in these boats,

343
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:51,389
除船长外 经历过各项职位
enlisted man to officer, except skipper.

344
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,791
你将来会是个好船长
You'd make a good one.

345
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,127
嗯 这是其他人该对我说的
Well, this is something other people should say for me,

346
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,765
可我现在就可以管理好这艘船
but I can handle this boat right now.

347
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,700
如果你不行的话 你就不会在这儿
Well, you wouldn't be here if you couldn't.

348
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:08,206
巴尼 这次攻击作战非比寻常
Barney, this attack is more than just routine.

349
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:12,577
每次不都这样
Well, they all are.

350
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:16,681
这报告上说有1400名战俘
The message said all 1,400 prisoners.

351
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:19,183
包括你的妻儿都在那运输船上
Your wife and baby are on that transport.

352
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:26,824
我们 会 攻击 “士那若”号
We are attacking the<i>Shinaru</i>.

353
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:31,862
巴尼 这不是个意外巧合
Barney, this is not an accident.

354
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,564
当你准备攻击的时候
Where do you think that transport will be

355
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,166
你以为那运输船会在哪儿
when you have to shoot?

356
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,468
他们故意用那船来当保护网
They're deliberately using her for a screen,

357
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:39,136
何况他们还有两艘驱逐舰
and they've got two destroyers.

358
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:42,773
能够抵近攻击本就很困难
It'll be tough even getting close enough to shoot!

359
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,610
你以为我不知道吗
Don't you think I know that?

360
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:50,581
巴尼 如果我们必须攻击 让我来做
Barney, if we must shoot, let me do it.

361
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:53,818
没别的事了 阿奇
That'll be all, Arch.

362
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:20,845
那艘最大的肯定就是我们的目标
That big one sure could be our flattop.

363
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,913
第二大的就是运输船
The next big one, the transport,

364
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:25,049
一艘驱逐舰在前面 另一艘在后面
that's the destroyer ahead, another one astern of the force.

365
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,751
距离有九英里
Range 9 miles.

366

372
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,687
哦 (下潜速度)真快
Well, that was fast.

373
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:03,888
太快了
Too fast.

374
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,356

Hustle and bustle, boy.

全速 2/3
All ahead 2/3.

376
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,201
全速 2/3 长官

379
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:24,875
所有排气管都已关闭
All vents cycled and shut, sir!

380
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,566
鱼雷发射准备

381
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:50,167
鱼雷发射准备

船头右转十度
Angle in the ballast starboard 10.

388
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,585
那运输船怎么办
What about that transport?

389
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:09,053
同样速度 同样距离
Same speed, same range.

00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:11,689
距离约1200码时 右舷发射
Estimate 1,200 yards and starboard beam.

391
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:13,624
太近了 巴尼 太近了
That's close, Barney, too close.

392
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:16,193
“士那若”号时速23海里

We're 3 minutes from firing point if you plan on firing

395
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:23,033
那我们距离发射点只有三分钟 长官

396
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,769
改到一千码 是 长官

397
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:27,371
驱逐舰正在改变航向
Destroyer is changing course.

398

它正朝我们来了

399
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,318
它正在长时间地侦测
She's pinging on long scale

400
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,187
可我认为它还没发现我们
but I don't think she's picked us up yet.

401
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:45,890
它工作还真辛苦 给它点时间
Give her time, old chap. It's hard work up there.

402

鱼雷发射管准备完毕
Forward tubes are ready, sir, except for outer doors.

407
00:23:56,602 --> 00:24:01,539
很好 我们试着分散攻击 升起潜望镜
Very well. We'll try a spread of 6. Take the scope, Archie.

408
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,407

00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:38,476
一分钟后可以发射
One minute to firing point, sir.

418
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:41,145
所有发射管准备就绪 很好
All tubes ready, sir, except for outer doors. Very well.

419
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:43,013
驱逐舰正在高速接近
Destroyer approaching at high speed.

420
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:00,865
打开外门 (鱼雷发射管前盖) 打开外门
Open outer doors. Open outer doors.

421
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:03,067
升起潜望镜 便于观察发射
Up scope, this is a shooting observation.

422
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:07,905
它在发信号
She's signaling.

423
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:09,473

427
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:16,080
30秒后发射 船头角度
30 seconds to firing point, sir. On the bow?

428
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,182
左舷10度 我们不能发射
10 degrees port, but we can't shoot,

429
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:20,117
会打到运输船的 已确认 长官
we'd hit the<i>Yoshida Maru.</i> Confirmed, sir.

430
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,453
鱼雷分叉角度太大 会击中运输船
A six-torpedo spread would hit the transport.

431
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,693
有没有时间再作修正
Chance for another setup?

432
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:31,629
恐怕不行 二十秒
Doubt it, chief. 20 seconds!

433
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:37,768
能发射几枚鱼雷 而不击中运输船
How many fish can you fire without hitting the transport?

434
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:39,336
两枚 有可能
Two, sir, possibly.

435
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,873
巴尼 你不能这样做
Barney, you can't.

436
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:45,242
不要冒险 长官 没人问你
I wouldn't risk it, sir. Nobody asked you to.

437
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:47,745
离的太近了 连打两枚也不行
It's too close even for two fish.

438
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,647
驱逐舰正在高速逼近

艇首鱼雷准备完毕
Bow tubes are standing by, sir.

444
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:05,462
巴尼 那是简和迪迪
Barney, it's Jane and Dede.

445
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:10,935
十秒钟后发射
10 seconds to shoot!

446
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:14,805
你不能这么做
You-- You can't.

447
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:16,273
到达发射点 发射
Firing point! Fire.

448
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:18,342
巴尼 巴尼
Barney! Barney!

449
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,949
一号发射正常
Number one running hot, straight and normal, sir.

450
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:31,455
二号发射正常
Number two running hot, straight and normal.

451
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,807
他真是了不起
That's a bit of all right.

452
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,208
希望如此
I hope so.

453
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,243
不管怎样 他做得对
Either way he is right.

454
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,213
巴尼 你不是想要确认一下结果吗
You want to take a look to confirm it, don't you, Barney?

455
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,848
长官 我们最好下潜
We better take her down deep, sir,

456
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:59,183
驱逐舰已经快追上我们了
the destroyer is almost on us.

457
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,719
你必须确认一下 巴尼
You've got to confirm, Barney.

458
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,061
关闭外门 (鱼雷发射管前盖)

关闭外门
Close the outer doors.

左满舵 全速下潜
Left full rudder. All ahead full.

463
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:31,115
我们正在全速下潜
Answer up all ahead full!

464
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:33,550
我们能潜多深 这儿有96海里深
How deep can you go? We've got 96 fathoms.

465
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:35,919
下潜300英尺 下潜300英尺
Take her down to 300 feet. Take her down to 300 feet.

466
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,921
300英尺 是 长官
300 feet, aye, sir.

467
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,691
至少鱼雷是直行前进的
At least they're running straight.

468
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,726
一号还有多久
What's the time on number one?

469
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:43,994
还有十秒
Ten seconds to go, sir.

470
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:45,496
左满舵 长官
Rudder left full, sir.

471
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:58,142
一号没有打中
Number one missed!

472
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,114
(爆炸)
(explosions)

473
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:50,527

(indistinct chatter)

474
00:28:58,337 --> 00:28:59,803
(模糊的颤音)船体中间进水 长官
(indistinct chatter)

475
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:02,673
2号还有多久
How long to number two?

476
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,309
八秒钟后击中“士那若”号
8 seconds to hit the<i>Shinaru,</i>sir.

477
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,480
要几秒 要几秒才打不中运输船
How many to-- How many to miss the transport?

478
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:11,281
两秒
2 seconds, sir.

479
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,350
(爆炸)
(explosion)

480
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:20,724
有可能会提前爆炸 船长
It could have been a premature explosion, captain.

481
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:23,527
我是说也许
It could have been.

482
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:24,862
不会 长官
No, sir.

483
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:41,578
(爆炸)
(explosions)

484
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:23,187
我认为他们暂时找不到我们
I assume they've lost us for the moment, captain.

485
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,322
300英尺深了 长官
At 300 feet, sir.

486
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:31,228
有运输船的声音传来
Noise from the transport, sir.

487
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:33,931
船体开始破裂了
She's breaking up.

488
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:37,634
海水正在大量涌入
Water's rushing in.

489
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,271
船舱正在开裂
Bulkheads are crushing.

490
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:02,426
调转航向
Reverse course.

491
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:05,162
调转航向 右满舵

上升到60英尺

60英尺 长官

495
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:23,680
那驱逐舰正在等我们 长官
The destroyers are waiting, captain.

496
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:25,916
我知道
I know that.

497
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:27,885
保持在60英尺 长官
At 60 feet and holding, sir.

498
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:07,691
那运输船怎么样了
What about that transport?

499
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:12,663
那些驱逐舰正在等着我们上去援救生还者
Those destroyers are waiting for us to pick up survivors.

500
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:16,767
他们把生还者当诱饵
They're using them as bait.

501
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,472
是吗
Well?

502
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:27,945
我们离开这里
Let's get out of here.

503
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:30,981
你来负责 阿奇
You take over, Arch.

504
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,218
控制室 80英尺
Control room, 80 feet.

505
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,420
80英尺 长官
80 feet, aye, sir.

506
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:38,522
缓慢下潜

方位 125 长官

510
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,100
够了 非常感谢
That's enough, thanks very much.

511
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:35,412
阿奇在那儿
Where's Arch?

512
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:36,913
去打电话了
Telephone he said.

513
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:40,384
嗯 都去了半个钟头了
Yeah, he's been gone a half hour.

514
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:42,119
31分钟
31 minutes.

515
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:47,958
除非我打招呼 否则他不会回来 我贿赂了他
He's not coming back until I signal, I bribed him.

516
00:33:49,294 --> 00:33:50,627
你什么
You what?

517
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:53,096
我贿赂了他 不会吧
I bribed him. No, you didn't.

518
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:55,132
哦 你不会这么做的 那不可能
No, you didn't do that, that's impossible.

519
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,067
你不可能贿赂阿奇
You can't bribe Arch.

520
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:58,635
你不知道我给了他什么
You don't know what I offered.

521
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:04,441
巴尼 当一艘船保护另一艘船时
Barney, what's the word you use

522
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,910
你管这叫什么
when one of your ships protects the other?

523
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:09,780
呃 叫护航舰 是的
Ah, it's called screening. Oh, yes.

524
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,314
你知道 当你用一艘船
You know, when you have one ship,

525
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,616
保护另一艘船时...
you want to protect another ship--

526
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:14,117
原则很明确
The principle is very clear.

527
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:15,619
前面的船...
Ship in front.

528
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:18,422
我不想再被护航了 巴尼
I'm tired of being screened, Barney.

529
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,457
五个月来 你一直让阿奇插在我们中间
For 5 months, you've kept Arch between us

530
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:22,793
就像个监护人 为什么
like a chaperone, why?

531
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:30,100
因为我爱你 简 这就是原因
Because I love you, Jane, that's why.

532
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,671
这是个很好的开端 说下去
That's a good start, go on.

533
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,843
我不是你理想的对象
I'm a bad risk.

534
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:42,012
那谁在冒险 你还是我
Who's taking it? You or me?

535
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:45,615
不
No.

536
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:48,218
是因为不久的将来 战争即将发生 而你我无法置身事外
Is it because there is going to be a war and we'll be in it?

537
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:50,921
巴尼 在过去的5个月里
Well, I've thought a lot about that too, Barney,

538
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,656
关于这些我也想了很多
for the past 5 months.

539
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:56,593
如果一切都像你所说的那样发生了
And if it all happens just exactly as you say it will,

540
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:58,662
我还是想要一个跟你一样的人
I still want a duplicate of you.

541
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:05,802
我有点想先要个小女孩儿
I kind of figured that I'd like to have a little girl first.

542
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:08,138
哦好 那我们得先开始成立个家庭
Well, fine then let's get the family started

543
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:12,542
否则就太晚了
before it's too late.

544
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,444
你确信
Are you sure?

545
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:16,446
真的认为我们应该这样做吗
Really sure that's what you want?

546
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,750
我已经答应阿奇 让他做孩子的教父了
I've already promised Archie could be godfather.

547
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:35,398
整整34分十秒
Exactly 34 minutes and 10 seconds.

548
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,434
还有五个月
And 5 months.

549
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:38,935
还有我们余下的一生
And all the rest of our lives.

550
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:53,483
(敲门)
(knocking on door)

551
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,653
谁
Yes?

552
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:00,357
当心 有点烫
Watch it, it's a little hot.

553
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,959
谢谢
Thanks.

554
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:04,094
谢谢 阿奇
Thanks, Arch.

555
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:07,731
巴尼 我能说几句吗
Barney, can I say something?

556

当然 说吧
Yeah, yeah, what?

557
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:12,702
是我的话我做不到
I couldn't have done it.

558
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,506
你不需要做
Well, you didn't have to.

559
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:19,776
简也会要你这么做的
Jane would have wanted you to try it.

560
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:26,183
是啊
Yeah.

561
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:33,023
嘿 来吧

565
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:49,573
那小子正在成长学习中

566
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:50,941
我也是
So am I.

567
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:57,447
我躲开了那两艘驱逐舰
I gave those two destroyers a slip

568
00:36:57,516 --> 00:36:59,616
重新装载了鱼雷并报告给作战指挥部
and reloaded and reported to ComSubPac.

569
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,252
他们怎么说
What did they say?

570
00:37:03,956 --> 00:37:06,923
建议立即返回珍珠港
Recommendation to return to Pearl Harbor at once.

571
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:13,263
还有呢 还有什么 阿奇

572
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:16,633
没别的了 只是例行的沉船报告
Nothing else, just a routine sinking report.

573
00:37:16,702 --> 00:37:19,970
我签了你的名字
I signed your name.

574

谢谢
Thanks.

575
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:24,107
巴尼 我们回珍珠港吧

576
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:30,747
我们还有16枚鱼雷 对吗
We still have 16 torpedoes left, haven't we?

577
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:32,315
没错
That's right.

578
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:39,055
珍珠港那边不需要这些
Well, they don't need them at Pearl.

579
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:00,477
鱼雷发射准备

来看一下
Take a look at that setup.

583
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:18,895
要是他们在浅滩上发现我们 我们会有大麻烦

584
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:21,331
我们往深水去
Let's head for deep water.

585

00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:25,335
你要进攻吗
Are you going to attack?

587
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:26,736
不是这些船
Not that outfit.

艇首预备 右舷30度
Hang on the bow, starboard 30,

594
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:04,841

set torpedoes at high speed, depth 6 feet.

595
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,242
这将是一次艇首直接攻击
It's gonna be a straight bow shot.

596
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:09,012
已经到达发射点 长官

船长 我们在打什么
Captain, what are we shooting at?

601
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,992
拉网船
Net tender.

602
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:23,927
唔
Hmm?

603
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,695
他们的网还开着呢
Their nets are still open.

604
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:28,531
福利 报告时间
Give me the time, Foley.

605
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,866
六秒
6 seconds!

606
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:38,141
(爆炸)
(explosion)

607
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:42,345
正中目标
Solid hit.

608
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:47,217
航向转为 045

(警笛嚎叫)
(siren wailing)

612
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:09,305
驱逐舰转回来了船长
The destroyer's made a turn, captain.

613
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:11,408
它发现我们没
She found us yet?

614
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:13,042
杂音太大 它找不到
Through that?

615
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,116
这就是漏洞
Makes an open room.

616
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:24,454
我们要穿插进去
We're going through.

617
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:48,511
保持警醒
Keep us in the clear.

618
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:51,181

Aye aye, sir.

619
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,784
我们要进入东京湾吗？
We're going into Tokyo Bay?

620
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:58,955
不是进入 长官 我们已经到了
Not going, sir, we are in.

621
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:12,402
周周 告诉船员
Tell them, Jojo.

622
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:15,004
船长通报
From captain to crew.

623
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:16,439
我们已经进入东京湾
We've entered Tokyo Bay.

624
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,442
万一他们发现...
What if they find out that--

625
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:20,910
嘘
Shh.

626
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:25,548
我们是第一艘进入东京湾的美国潜艇
First American sub in Tokyo Bay.

627
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:27,917
你觉得怎么样 福利
How about dinner, Foley?

628
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:31,421
太棒了 希望是来回航程
Great, if it's a round trip.

629
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,556
(雷达脉冲)
(radar pinging)

630
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,158
正前方有水雷
Mines dead ahead.

631
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:41,331
紧急下潜
Take us down fast!

632
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:45,134
航向转为 005 左满舵 下潜95英尺

635
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,842
左满舵 长官
Rudder is left full, sir.

636
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,037
后面有船极速追来 长官
Contact to stern coming up fast, sir.

637
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,406
是艘驱逐舰
It's a destroyer pinging.

638
00:42:23,475 --> 00:42:25,041
保持前进
Steady as you go.

639
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,243
保持前进 长官
Steady as you go, aye, sir.

640
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:43,459
各位是不是觉得身上有点发热
Don't any of you chaps find it a trifle warm?

641
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,163
你干嘛 难道想要去观光吗 长官
Do you want to go sightseeing, sir?

642
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,899
听着像是个好主意
It seemed a good idea then.

643
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:08,618
慢速前进
All ahead dead slow.

644
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:10,086
慢速前进 长官
All ahead dead slow, sir.

645
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:46,923
驱逐舰快追上我们了 距离700码 长官
The tin can is closing fast, 700 yards, sir.

646
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:48,958
它跟着我们进入了布雷区
He's following us into the minefields.

647
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:51,527
它跟过来实在太愚蠢了
He is a fool coming in here.

648
00:43:51,596 --> 00:43:54,130
也可以说它很有胆量 长官
You could say he has guts too, sir.

649
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:56,532
很快就没有了
Well, he won't have them long.

650
00:44:01,106 --> 00:44:02,972
(爆炸)
(explosion)

651
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:13,416
它是个无畏的勇士
He's a happy warrior.

652
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:16,919
转舵向左
Left standard rudder.

653
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:19,055
转舵向左 长官
Left standard rudder, aye, sir.

654
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:22,258
我们最好返回海湾通道
Better get back into the channel.

655
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,694
要想返回海湾通道
If we can make the channel, we'd have 150 feet

656
00:44:24,763 --> 00:44:26,229
我们必须潜深150英尺 船长
of good water, captain.

657
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:38,141
(金属叮当声)
(metal clanging)

658
00:44:47,786 --> 00:44:50,286
听着像是船头被水雷的线缆钩住了
Sounds like we fouled a mine cable up forward.

659
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:53,356
停车 紧急倒退 转舵回中
All stop, all back emergency, rudder amidships.

660
00:44:53,425 --> 00:44:56,659
停车 紧急倒退 转舵回中 长官

664
00:45:29,194 --> 00:45:31,060
慢速前进
All ahead dead slow.

665
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:53,983
航向转为 335.
Come to course 335.

666
00:45:54,052 --> 00:45:56,352
335 长官
335, aye, sir!

667
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:28,184
干的漂亮 长官
Beautiful, sir.

668
00:46:28,253 --> 00:46:29,952
真令我大开眼界
I wouldn't have missed that.

669
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:32,288
我可不想
I would.

670
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:36,759
你觉得怎样 本森
How do you feel, Benson?

671
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:38,661
我好长时间都没知觉了 长官
I haven't felt for an hour, sir.

672
00:46:40,165 --> 00:46:42,198
听到个很微弱的声音 长官
There's a faint sound, sir.

673
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:44,767
反正不太靠近我们
Nothing close anyway.

674
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:48,437
我们有足够空间转向进入海湾通道了 船长
We got room to turn seaward now, captain.

675
00:46:48,506 --> 00:46:51,307
保持前进 保持前进 长官
Steady as you go. Steady as you go, aye, sir.

678
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,616
借过
Going through.

679
00:47:00,685 --> 00:47:02,718
万一他们把我们身后的网关上
But if they close the nets behind us?

680
00:47:02,787 --> 00:47:06,722
噢 就是这个声音
Oh, that's all that sound is, sir.

681
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:08,457
噢
All?

682
00:47:27,812 --> 00:47:29,178
但是...
But...

683
00:47:29,247 --> 00:47:31,314
如果网关上了
if the nets are closed...

684
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:33,349
东京是个大城市
Tokyo is a big town, sir.

685
00:47:33,418 --> 00:47:35,251
我们会找到公寓住的
We'll find a boarding house.

686
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:39,889
可以升起潜望镜了 船长
At periscope depth, captain.

687
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:44,827
后面还有没有声音
Any contacts with stern?

688
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:45,962
没有 长官
No contact, sir.

689
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:52,068
上升
Take it up.

690
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:54,136
前方无障碍 水雷区在左
Straight out ahead, minefield to port.

691
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,338
在航海图上做好标记 福利
Mark it on the chart, Mr. Fisher,

692
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:56,706
便于我们往返进出
for the round trip.

693
00:47:56,774 --> 00:47:58,474
正在标记
Marking it now, sir.

694
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,583
你找到它了 呵
You got her, huh?

695
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:10,519
你看看
Look.

696
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:17,260
各位 “士那若”号
The<i>Shinaru,</i>gentlemen.

697
00:48:22,834 --> 00:48:24,667
做好战斗准备 鱼雷发射管待命
Battle stations torpedo, make ready all bow tubes.

00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:26,595
嘿 我想他说的对
Hey, I think he's right.

840
00:59:26,664 --> 00:59:28,397
嗨 别闹了 伙计们
Hey, knock it off, you guys.

841
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,800
船长怎么样了 长官 他很好 没事了
How's the captain, sir? He's coming along fine.

842
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:33,569
哦 太好了 好
Oh, that's good. Good.

843
00:59:33,637 --> 00:59:38,874
呃 斯隆先生 你跟女人遇到过麻烦吗
Mr. Sloan, have you ever had any trouble with dames?

844
00:59:38,943 --> 00:59:41,376
哦 是 偶尔也有过
Well, yeah. Once in a while.

845
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:43,312
(笑)
(laughter)

846
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:58,026
早上好 先生们
Good morning, gentlemen.

847
00:59:58,095 --> 00:59:59,127
早安 长官 早安 长官
Morning, sir. Morning, sir.

848
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:00,462
早安 长官
Good morning, sir.

849
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,003
你们为什么不去喝点咖啡
Why don't you boys get some coffee?

850
01:00:08,072 --> 01:00:09,304
这里我来值守
I'll take over the watch.

851
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:10,305
是 长官
Yes, sir.

852
01:00:10,374 --> 01:00:11,406
是 长官
Aye, sir.

853
01:00:13,711 --> 01:00:15,644
我们位置在那儿
What's our position?

854
01:00:15,713 --> 01:00:18,447
我们距离皇家夏威夷酒店
8 days, 16 hours and...

855
01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:21,116
还有八天十六小时零十分钟
10 minutes from the bar of the Royal Hawaiian.

856
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,753
我昏睡了这么久吗
I was out that long?

857
01:00:24,822 --> 01:00:26,288
干嘛不睡
Why shouldn't you sleep?

858
01:00:26,357 --> 01:00:27,122
是啊
Yeah.

859
01:00:27,191 --> 01:00:29,758
我们要回家了
We're going home.

860
01:00:29,827 --> 01:00:31,693
你怎么报告的
What did you report?

861
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:34,196
我告诉作战指挥部 交代皇家
I told ComSubPac to have the Royal Hawaiian

862
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:35,731
夏威夷酒店 多安排个酒保
put out another bartender.

863
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:38,467
还说什么了
What else did you tell them?

864
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,970
没有了
Nothing else.

865
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:45,974
阿奇 你知道的
Arch, you know that...

866
01:00:47,845 --> 01:00:49,411
你心里很清楚
sleep as you call it,

867
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,912
你所称之为的“睡眠”
that could put me behind a desk

868
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,948
是有可能让我失去船长资格的
for the rest of the war.

869
01:00:53,017 --> 01:00:54,182
不是吗
You know that, don't you?

870
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:56,084
大家都需要睡觉的
Everybody sleeps.

871
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:58,186
谁知道你睡了多久
Who knows how long you slept?

872
01:00:58,956 --> 01:01:00,322
你知道
You do.

873
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:06,261
如果作战指挥部 追问这些事情 你会怎么说
If ComSubPac should ask you anything, what would you tell them?

874
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,296
他们干嘛要问 你会怎么回答
Why should they ask? What would you tell them?

875
01:01:08,365 --> 01:01:13,635
如果他们问了 巴尼 我一定会说实话
If they ask, Barney, I'd have to tell the truth.

876
01:01:18,575 --> 01:01:22,277
阿奇 你是唯一一个活着
Arch, you are the only man alive

877
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:25,113
能阻止我击沉“士那若”号的人
who can keep me from getting the<i>Shinaru.</i>

878
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:29,718
你不觉得我也很想击沉它吗 巴尼
Don't you think I want it too, Barney?

879
01:01:32,456 --> 01:01:33,522
谢谢
Thanks.

880
01:01:37,628 --> 01:01:39,594
当他过来的时候 我们捉弄他一下
When he gets here, let's really pour it on him.

881
01:01:39,663 --> 01:01:40,962
好
Yeah.

882
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:43,065
这是你的帽子
(humming) Here's your hat.

883
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:44,733
本森 你找我吗
You're looking for me, Benson?

884
01:01:44,802 --> 01:01:46,535
昨晚最后一个看幻灯片的人是你 对吗
You were the last one to look at the slides yesterday?

885
01:01:46,603 --> 01:01:48,270
是啊 而且片子非常棒
Yeah, and they were the greatest--

886
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:49,938
听着 别想找什么借口
Look, don't try to worm out of it.

887
01:01:50,007 --> 01:01:51,473
你知道你做了什么 你摸了它
You know what you did? You touched it.

888
01:01:51,542 --> 01:01:53,575
摸了它 而且还弄脏了
Touched it? And smudged it!

889
01:01:53,644 --> 01:01:56,611
弄脏了 而且还把你的大肥手指印 都印在上面了
Smudged it? Left your big fat fingerprint all over it.

890
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,280
你看看
Look at that!

891
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,316
在那儿
Where?

892
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:03,952
你知道在哪儿 你是说 靠近...
You know where. You mean right by--

893
01:02:04,021 --> 01:02:06,188
不 就在右下角这儿
No, down in the right hand corner.

894
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:07,856
哦 对 我好像看见了
Oh, yeah, I think I see it.

895
01:02:07,925 --> 01:02:09,925
你好像看见了 你当然看得见
You think you see it? Of course you see it!

896
01:02:09,993 --> 01:02:11,760
我第一次让个笨蛋来处理幻灯片
First time I let some jughead handle the slides,

897
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:14,429
他就毁了我的生意 梅特卡夫 把这记下
he ruins my business. Metcalf, put this down.

898
01:02:14,498 --> 01:02:17,399
盖瑞迪 两周之内不准看幻灯片
Garrity, no slides for 2 weeks!

899
01:02:17,468 --> 01:02:19,868
两个星期 没幻灯片看
No slides for 2 weeks?

900
01:02:19,937 --> 01:02:22,337
嘿 本森 等一下 我要跟你谈一谈
Hey, Benson, wait a minute, I want to talk to you.

901
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,559
请准许上船
Permission to come aboard, sir.

902
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:45,794
准许 长官
Certainly, sir.

903
01:02:45,863 --> 01:02:47,295
巴尼 将军
Barney. Admiral.

904
01:02:47,364 --> 01:02:48,563
你好 亚当 你好 巴尼 身体好吗
Hello, Adams. Hello, Barney, how are you?

905
01:02:48,632 --> 01:02:49,998
很高兴见到你
Nice to see you.

906
01:02:50,067 --> 01:02:51,833
有进一步的消息吗 先生
Any further news, sir?

907
01:02:51,902 --> 01:02:54,402
抱歉 巴尼 毫无音讯
Sorry, Barney, no, not a word.

908
01:02:54,471 --> 01:02:56,838
没有生还者被救上来吗 没有跟这有关的报告
No survivors were picked up, huh? No report of it.

909
01:02:56,907 --> 01:02:59,040
他们完全封锁了消息
They've put a blackout over the whole thing.

910
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:00,509
你知道的跟我们一样多
You know as much as we do.

911
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:02,477
我要多久才能回船上去 长官
How soon can I get back, sir?

912
01:03:02,546 --> 01:03:05,247
巴尼 潜艇在没有破损的情况下 会运行得更好
Barney, submarines work better without holes in them.

913
01:03:05,315 --> 01:03:07,149
嗯 情况不是太严重 将军
Well, these aren't too bad, admiral,

914
01:03:07,217 --> 01:03:08,950
如果您能优先安排替我们修理
if I can have first priority in dry dock.

915
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:10,452
嗯 我们会尽力而为的
Well, we'll do our best.

916
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:12,954
你现在的命令是多多休息
Meanwhile, your orders are take it easy.

917
01:03:13,023 --> 01:03:14,389
我们在皇家夏威夷酒店
We have rooms for you

918
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:15,824
替你准备了房间 指挥官
at the Royal Hawaiian, commander.

919
01:03:15,893 --> 01:03:17,359
那太好了 谢谢
That's fine. Thank you.

920
01:03:17,427 --> 01:03:18,860
跟我一起共进午餐好吗 指挥官
Are you joining me for luncheon, commander?

921
01:03:18,929 --> 01:03:20,162
谢谢 长官
Thank you, sir.

922
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:40,882
怎么了 你睡不着吗
What's the matter? Can't you sleep?

923
01:03:40,951 --> 01:03:42,450
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding?

924
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:44,186
你吵得我无法入睡
You're keeping me awake.

925
01:03:49,927 --> 01:03:53,795
我说 巴尼 你不会在这儿击沉“士那若”的
Look, Barney, you won't sink the<i>Shinaru</i>in here.

926
01:03:55,399 --> 01:03:57,032
你心里很明白 将军在跟我们兜圈子
That admiral has given us the run around.

927
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:58,533
他在敷衍我们 不是吗
You know that, don't you?

928
01:03:58,602 --> 01:04:01,369
他给我们的船 优先维修的待遇
He gave us first priority in dry dock.

929
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:02,938
说的没错
That's right, that...

930
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:05,607
他是这么做了
That he did.

931
01:04:10,848 --> 01:04:12,647
可他没再问你其他的事 对吗
He didn't ask you anything else, did he?

932
01:04:14,084 --> 01:04:15,150
阿
Huh?

933
01:04:15,219 --> 01:04:17,619
最后一次回答你 没有
For the last time, no.

934
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:19,221
你确定
Are you sure?

935
01:04:19,289 --> 01:04:21,356
你现在还是回床上休息去吧
Now will you get to bed and get some rest?

936
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:24,726
好吧
Okay.

937
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:28,430
好吧 哥们儿 好吧
Okay, buddy, okay.

938
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:38,673
斯隆(海军)上尉报告 长官
Lieutenant Sloan reporting, sir.

939
01:04:38,742 --> 01:04:40,842
早上好 阿奇 您找我吗
Good morning, Arch. You sent for me?

940
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:42,077
坐下
Sit down.

941
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:43,912
谢谢 长官
Thank you, sir.

942
01:04:43,981 --> 01:04:46,147
阿奇 我能给你的
Arch, what would be the best possible news

943
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:48,083
最好消息是什么
I could give you?

944
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:49,317
角鲨号修复
Sailing order, sir.

945
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:50,752
可以起航的命令 长官
<i> Greyfish</i>is ready.

946
01:04:50,821 --> 01:04:52,053
那不算是最好的消息
That is news.

947
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:53,855
可我已经很满意了 长官
It'll do very nicely, sir.

948
01:04:53,924 --> 01:04:55,657
你想不想要一艘自己的船
How would you like your own boat,

949
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:57,759
指挥官 斯隆上尉
Lieutenant Commander Sloan?

950
01:04:59,429 --> 01:05:01,529
我自己的船
My own command?

951
01:05:01,598 --> 01:05:03,798
你的升职命令刚刚下达
Your promotion has just come through.

952
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:07,168
阿奇 你从最底层做起直到现在 这是段漫长而又艰苦的历程
That's a long haul from apprentice seaman, Arch.

953
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:09,371
现在 一艘崭新的潜艇正在新伦敦(地名 在美国)
A brand new sub waiting at New London

954
01:05:09,439 --> 01:05:11,172
等待它的首任船长
for a top skipper.

955
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,241
那 就是你
The record says that's you.

956
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:18,780
有意思 我-我都不知道该说什么了
Funny, I-- I don't know what to say.

957
01:05:18,849 --> 01:05:21,449
每一位和你共事过的船长 都说你堪当此任
Every skipper you've served with has said it for you.

958
01:05:21,518 --> 01:05:23,618
谢谢 长官
Well, thank you, sir.

959
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,088
我能问个问题吗 长官
May I ask a question, sir?

960
01:05:27,157 --> 01:05:28,823
尽管问
All you like.

961
01:05:28,892 --> 01:05:31,326
巴尼会不会再回角鲨号当船长
Is Barney taking the<i>Greyfish</i>out again?

962
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:35,530
阿奇 这是另外一个问题了 对我不是 长官
Arch, that's a different problem. Not to me, sir.

963
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,666
你该有自己的船了 阿奇
You've earned the command, Arch.

964
01:05:37,734 --> 01:05:40,035
而巴尼也该有另一次机会去打沉“士那若”号
And Barney has earned another crack at the<i>Shinaru,</i>sir.

965
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:42,704
他早应该去转做行政工作 再好好休息一下了
He's overdue for a desk job and a good rest.

966
01:05:42,773 --> 01:05:46,007
他仍是你手下最好的船长 将军
He's still the best skipper you've got, admiral.

967
01:05:46,076 --> 01:05:49,277
分配工作时要考虑很多因素和条件 阿奇
There's more than one factor in duty assignments, Arch.

968
01:05:49,346 --> 01:05:51,913
这些条件你都具备 所以你该有艘自己的船
You've got them all for your own boat.

969
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:55,350
我仍想继续当巴尼的副手 长官
I'd still have the same as Barney's exec, sir.

970
01:05:55,419 --> 01:05:58,086
我条件不变 你还是想继续当他的副手
If you want to remain his exec.

971
01:05:58,155 --> 01:05:59,421
是的 长官
I do, sir.

972
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:02,691
阿奇 你是不是在替他掩饰
Arch, are you covering for him?

973
01:06:04,895 --> 01:06:06,561
掩饰什么 长官
Covering what, sir?

974
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:10,598
他是否在你们撤出东京湾后就一直昏睡
Was he knocked out after you came out of Tokyo Bay?

975
01:06:13,537 --> 01:06:15,236
三天 长官
3 days, sir.

976
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:17,172
可你也知道他都经历了些什么
But you know what he'd been though.

977
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,740
我当然知道
Of course I do.

978
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:21,309
但只有你一个人知道到底发生了些什么
But only you know what came out of it.

979
01:06:21,378 --> 01:06:23,244
他新的体格检查通过了
Well, he's passed his new physical exam.

980
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,380
很好 他现在的问题不是身体上
Perfect, the problem is not physical.

981
01:06:25,449 --> 01:06:26,982
他到底还行不行 阿奇
Is he fit, Arch?

982
01:06:28,352 --> 01:06:30,652
他当然有点紧张 但是...
He's tense, of course, but...

983
01:06:30,721 --> 01:06:32,287
如果他不紧张 我才担心
I'd be worried if he weren't.

984
01:06:32,356 --> 01:06:33,755
我想他还是行的
I think he's fit

985
01:06:33,824 --> 01:06:35,657
我想跟他一起出航
and I want to sail with him.

986
01:06:37,594 --> 01:06:39,861
“士那若”号至今仍毫无消息
The<i>Shinaru</i> is still unreported.

987
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:43,064
我能给他最好的 就是一个希望极其渺茫的猜想
The best I could give him would be a long shot hunch.

988
01:06:43,133 --> 01:06:45,800
我很想跟巴尼一起
I'd like to try it, sir.

989
01:06:45,869 --> 01:06:47,102
再去试试 长官
With Barney.

990
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:54,442
谢谢 阿奇 你帮了我不少
Thanks, Arch, you've helped me.

991
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:56,111
谢谢 长官
Thank you, sir.

992
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,746
那巴尼呢
But what about Barney?

993
01:06:57,814 --> 01:07:00,315
你也帮他争取到了再一次出航的机会
You've helped him, too, to one more trip.

994
01:07:00,384 --> 01:07:02,984
这次要是再打不沉“士那若”号
Get that<i>Shinaru</i>this time or you'll have to kill her

995
01:07:03,053 --> 01:07:04,185
就得用你自己的船去打了
with your own boat.

996
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:05,520
是 长官
Yes, sir.

997
01:07:08,025 --> 01:07:11,292
将军 你了解巴尼
Admiral, you know Barney.

998
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,094
如果他知道我获得了晋升的命令
If he knew I'd been offered my own command,

999
01:07:13,163 --> 01:07:14,195
他会逼我接受的
he'd make me take it.

1000
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:16,131
没错 他会
Yes, he would.

1001
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:20,135
好吧 我不会告诉他的 因为在这次出航之后
All right, I won't tell him, because after this trip,

1002
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:21,469
我会逼你接受的
I'm making you take it.

1003
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,638
是 长官
Yes, sir.

980
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,200
太平洋潜艇司令部 致

981
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:56,900
角鲨号指挥官 巴尼・道尔船长

982
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:03,300
与蓝鳍金枪鱼号一起

983
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:15,100
在护航驱逐舰掩护下到达指定海域(巴伯斯角)(地名 美国港口)

984
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:23,100
出航后再打开命令封条

1004
01:08:27,571 --> 01:08:28,903
怎么了
What's wrong?

1005
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:35,577
要我们巡逻吉斯卡岛
Kiska... approach patrol.

1006
01:08:35,645 --> 01:08:37,846
你知道这意味着什么 不是吗
You know what that means, don't you?

1007
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:40,949
他们把我们打入了冷宫
Well, they put us right, right in the deep freeze.

1008
01:08:41,017 --> 01:08:42,684
放松 巴尼
Easy, Barney.

1009
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:44,886
毕竟他不能只为了一艘船而开战
After all he isn't running the war just for one boat.

1010
01:08:44,955 --> 01:08:46,421
你现在能明白他的意思吗
You reading his mind now?

1011
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:48,790
不能 不过我跟他谈过
Well, no, I talked to him.

1012
01:08:53,029 --> 01:08:54,596
什么
What?

1013
01:08:54,664 --> 01:08:58,066
巴尼 那“士那若”号没有一点消息
Barney, the<i>Shinaru</i> is unreported.

1014
01:08:58,135 --> 01:09:01,469
将军说 他会给我们他认为的最佳猜想地点
He said he's giving us the best long shot hunch he has,

1015
01:09:01,538 --> 01:09:03,938
而他的猜想都是基于良好的情报来源
and his hunches are based on good intelligence.

1016
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:07,308
你们还谈了些什么
What else did you talk about?

1017
01:09:07,377 --> 01:09:09,177
你
You.

1018
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:13,014
说下去
Go on.

1019
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:16,317
他想知道自东京湾撤离后
He wanted to know how long you'd been knocked out

1020
01:09:16,386 --> 01:09:17,785
你昏睡了有多久？
after Tokyo Bay.

1021
01:09:18,588 --> 01:09:19,854
我告诉他了
I told him.

1022
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:25,326
你还告诉他些什么 嗯
What else did you tell him, hmm?

1023
01:09:25,395 --> 01:09:28,763
我说我要跟你一起出航
I told him I wanted to sail with you.

1024
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:31,666
你去跟海军上将胡说八道
You go shoot your mouth off to the admiral

1025
01:09:31,735 --> 01:09:33,334
然后接下来你瞧 我们去守吉斯卡岛了
and next thing you know we're headed for Kiska.

1026
01:09:33,403 --> 01:09:34,903
我在支持你
Steady, boy.

1027
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:36,437
你本可以要求调职的
You could have quit me, you could have asked

1028
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:37,672
你可以离开我的 为什么不
for a transfer, why didn't you?

1029
01:09:37,741 --> 01:09:39,240
是的 我本就可以离开你的
Yes, I could have quit you!

1030
01:09:39,309 --> 01:09:40,975
那你为什么不那样做
Well, why didn't you?

1031
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:45,046
你难道不明白吗
Don't you know that yet?

1032
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:49,817
等一下 斯隆先生
Just a minute, Mr. Sloan.

1033
01:09:51,288 --> 01:09:53,354
你现在给我听清楚
Now you get this straight.

1034
01:09:53,423 --> 01:09:55,290
我...
I...

1035
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:58,092
我一定要打沉“士那若”号 不管你怎么想
I'm gonna get the<i>Shinaru</i> in spite of what you think,

1036
01:09:58,161 --> 01:09:59,661
不管海军上将怎么想
in spite of what the admiral thinks,

1037
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:01,629
不管其他任何人怎么想
in spite of what anybody thinks.

1038
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:03,398
听清楚了吗
Now you got that straight?

1039
01:10:03,466 --> 01:10:04,632
是 长官
Yes, sir.

1040
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:06,034
我清楚了
I got it.

1041
01:10:06,102 --> 01:10:07,902
就这样
That's all.

1042
01:10:25,422 --> 01:10:26,721
船长
Captain!

1043
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:28,456
船长 什么事
Captain! Yes.

1044
01:10:28,525 --> 01:10:31,025
是“士那若”号 它正开往吉斯卡港
The<i>Shinaru,</i>she is heading for Kiska Harbor.

1045
01:10:36,466 --> 01:10:37,899
给我找出从这儿
Give me the shortest course

1046
01:10:37,968 --> 01:10:39,267
到吉斯卡港的最短航线
between here and Kiska Harbor.

1047
01:10:39,336 --> 01:10:40,568
是 长官
Aye aye, sir.

1048
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:45,373
建议主航向为 085 船长
Recommended base course 085, Captain.

1049
01:10:45,442 --> 01:10:46,708
调整航向为 085
Come to course 085!

1050
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:48,009
全速前进
All ahead full.

1051
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:49,978
航向 085 长官
085, aye, sir.

1052
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,580
全速前进
All ahead full.

1053
01:10:52,649 --> 01:10:54,115
全速前进 长官
All ahead full, sir.

1054
01:10:56,086 --> 01:10:57,986
给蓝鳍金枪鱼号发消息
Message to <i> Bluefin:</i>

1055
01:10:58,054 --> 01:11:00,955
跟随我们 主航向 085
Follow us, base course 085.

1056
01:11:01,024 --> 01:11:02,423
是 长官
Aye, sir.

1057
01:11:02,492 --> 01:11:04,158
全速前进 长官
Answer up, all ahead full, sir.

1058
01:11:07,797 --> 01:11:11,132
斯隆先生到舰桥来一下
Mr. Sloan, come to the bridge.

1059
01:11:29,753 --> 01:11:31,352
这个是什么意思
What does this mean?

1060
01:11:31,421 --> 01:11:33,921
为了你自己的船才把你叫回来
About bringing you back for your own boat?

1061
01:11:35,592 --> 01:11:37,058
你听着像什么意思
What does it sound like?

1062
01:11:41,498 --> 01:11:44,265
将军什么时候给你机会开自己的船
When did the admiral offer you your own command?

1063
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:47,035
你关心这干嘛
Why should you care?

1064
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,773
阿奇 我真希望你接受了
I wish you'd taken it, Arch.

1065
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:54,676
我也是
That makes two of us.

1066
01:11:54,744 --> 01:11:57,345
我想要一直追随你的 巴尼
I want to follow in your footsteps, Barney...

1067
01:11:59,015 --> 01:12:01,082
但我们中有一个人变了
but one of us has changed.

1068
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:21,135
长官 我们已经到了吉斯卡港的入口
We're here, sir, part of the entrance to Kiska Harbor.

1069
01:12:22,272 --> 01:12:23,571
雷达
Radar?

1070
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,373
那里是海岬 长官
There's the headland, sir.

1071
01:12:25,442 --> 01:12:27,942
蓝鳍金枪鱼号在我们后面500码
The<i>Bluefin,</i> 500 yards astern of us.

1072
01:12:29,245 --> 01:12:30,645
我们从海面上进入港口
No more going on the surface.

1073
01:12:30,714 --> 01:12:31,879
清理舰桥
Clear the bridge.

1074
01:12:31,948 --> 01:12:33,214
清理舰桥
TOGETHER: Clear the bridge!

1075
01:12:35,251 --> 01:12:36,884
伙计们下去喝点咖啡
You men, go down and get yourselves

1076
01:12:36,953 --> 01:12:38,953
让身子尽快暖和起来
some coffee and get warm real fast.

1077
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:40,388
福利 是 长官
Foley? Yes, sir.

1078
01:12:40,457 --> 01:12:41,789
福利 你守在TDC(鱼雷数据计算机)边上
Foley, stand by the TDC.

1079
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,157
是 长官 那舱门口怎么办
Yes, sir. How about the hatch?

1080
01:12:43,226 --> 01:12:44,992
关闭舱门 关闭舱门
Lock it down! Lock it down!

1081
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:47,662
我们要准备进攻了 是啊
We're attacking, of course. We are.

1082
01:12:47,731 --> 01:12:49,731
我来把船潜下去 长官
I'd dive the boat, sir.

1083
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:53,935
我知道我们目前没有能见度
I'm aware that we have no visibility,

1084
01:12:54,003 --> 01:12:56,838
所以我要利用雷达配合声纳来查看
that's why I want my radar to help my sonar.

1085
01:12:56,906 --> 01:12:58,940
雷达已经结冰了
Radar is already icing,

1086
01:12:59,008 --> 01:13:01,142
而这港口不易进入
and this is a tricky entrance, sir.

1087
01:13:09,085 --> 01:13:12,320
左满舵 调整航向 225
Left full rudder, come to course 225.

1088
01:13:12,389 --> 01:13:13,621
全速2/3
All ahead 2/3.

1089
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:15,123
左满舵 航向 225
Left full rudder, 225.

1090
01:13:15,191 --> 01:13:17,759
全速2/3 长官
All ahead 2/3, aye, sir!

1091
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:28,035
声纳有反应 有巨大反应
Contact. Broad contact.

1092
01:13:28,104 --> 01:13:30,938
我们要越过一道屏障 雷达
This is all across both bars. Radar?

1093
01:13:31,007 --> 01:13:32,440
没有反应 长官
No contact to head, sir.

1094
01:13:32,509 --> 01:13:33,941
肯定是天线冻住了
My antenna must be iced.

1095
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:35,443
我得到的都是微弱信号
All I'm getting is a faint headland.

1096
01:13:36,613 --> 01:13:37,945
找到了
Got it now!

1097
01:13:38,014 --> 01:13:39,714
看 那么多亮点
Look at all those blips.

1098
01:13:39,783 --> 01:13:41,115
半数的日本海军(舰艇)都在里面
Half the Jap navy must be in there.

1099
01:13:41,184 --> 01:13:43,785
我数了下有九艘船
I count nine ships, sir.

1100
01:13:43,853 --> 01:13:45,319
目标距离 3000码
Range? 3,000 yards.

1101
01:13:45,388 --> 01:13:47,121
那最大的亮点一定是艘航母
That big blip must be the flattop.

1102
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:49,323
这跟刚才那个不是相同的反应
It's not the same contact, sir.

1103
01:13:49,392 --> 01:13:52,193
是的 长官 另一个大反应距离我们前方200码远
No, sir, mine's a broad contact 200 yards ahead.

1104
01:13:55,231 --> 01:13:56,931
这可能就是情报部门所说的
It could be the log and chain boom

1105
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,499
由进口原木和链式吊杆构成的巨大屏障
imported by intelligence, captain.

1106
01:13:58,568 --> 01:14:00,368
有多近 就快到了
How close? Coming fast, sir.

1107
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:02,103
再做一次确认
We'll stay for one more confirmation.

1108
01:14:02,172 --> 01:14:03,805
太危险了 船长
It's a bad risk, captain.

1109
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:31,766
那航母就停在海岬尖角附近 距离我们1200码
It's parked at 1,200 yards, just coming around the headland tip.

1110
01:14:31,835 --> 01:14:33,000
它正在攻击我们 长官
She's attacking, sir.

1111
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:34,836
(爆炸)
(explosions)

1112
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,478
巨大障碍就在我们正前方 长官
Hard boom dead ahead, sir.

1113
01:14:43,546 --> 01:14:44,479
下潜 是 长官
Dive! Yes, sir.

1114
01:14:44,547 --> 01:14:45,847
紧急下潜
Dive the boat.

1115
01:14:47,317 --> 01:14:49,183
(爆炸)
(explosions)

1116
01:15:09,038 --> 01:15:12,273
(警报响起)
(alarm blaring)

1117
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:26,587
快点 马上过来
Come on! Come on right away!

1118
01:15:26,656 --> 01:15:29,290
(警报持续鸣响)
(alarm blaring continuously)

1119
01:15:47,477 --> 01:15:50,278
长官 巴克艾报告艇上的压力正越来越大
Mr. Buckeye reports pressure building up in the boat, sir.

1120
01:15:50,346 --> 01:15:52,947
压力多少 压力多少
How much pressure? How much pressure?

1121
01:15:53,016 --> 01:15:55,917
八磅 长官 我们有条空气管破裂了 不过可以修好
Eight pounds, sir. We got a ruptured air line but we can handle it!

1122
01:15:55,985 --> 01:15:57,552
这里有多深
How much depth do we have here?

1123
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:59,220
30英寻(约55米) 长官
30 fathoms, sir.

1124
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:01,856
下潜至90英尺
Take us down to 90 feet.

1125
01:16:01,925 --> 01:16:03,591
下潜到90英尺
Take it down to 90 feet.

1126
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:04,892
90英尺
90 feet!

1127
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:06,627
两个潜望镜都卡住了 长官
We've lost both scopes, sir.

1128
01:16:06,696 --> 01:16:08,095
雷达失灵 长官
Radar inoperative, sir.

1129
01:16:08,164 --> 01:16:09,530
天线一定是被撞毁了
Antenna must have been carried away.

1130
01:16:13,369 --> 01:16:15,803
保持原航向 保持原航向 长官
Steady as you go. Steady as you go, sir.

1131
01:16:15,872 --> 01:16:17,238
各舱室报告情况
All compartments report in.

1132
01:16:17,307 --> 01:16:18,673
怎么了 巴尼
What's the matter, Barney?

1133
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:22,243
医务官 立即马上跑步到指挥舱来
Pharmacist, right to the conning tower on the double.

1134
01:16:22,312 --> 01:16:24,545
医务官立即马上跑步赶到 长官
Pharmacist right on the double, aye, sir!

1135
01:16:27,183 --> 01:16:29,216
过来坐到海图桌边上 巴尼
Come sit over by the chart table, Barney.

1136
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:33,921
长官 蓝鳍金枪鱼号呼叫 要求确认目前情况
<i> Bluefin</i>is calling in for a check, sir.

1137
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:35,489
告诉他们 我们正在继续攻击
Tell them we're proceeding with the attack.

1138
01:16:35,558 --> 01:16:36,757
是 长官
Aye, sir.

1139
01:16:36,826 --> 01:16:38,259
保持在90英尺深 长官
90 feet and holding, sir!

1140
01:16:39,562 --> 01:16:40,595
把他的手臂放到桌上
Get his arm on the table.

1141
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:43,331
检查一下
Take a look at this.

1142
01:16:47,737 --> 01:16:49,503
怎么样
How is it?

1143
01:16:49,572 --> 01:16:51,772
肘部上方骨折了 船长
It's broken above the elbow, captain.

1144
01:16:51,841 --> 01:16:53,708
我可以把它接上
I can handle it.

1145
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:55,009
那就做吧
Go ahead then.

1146
01:17:07,757 --> 01:17:09,090
本森 是 长官
Benson? Aye, sir.

1147
01:17:09,158 --> 01:17:10,524
告诉费雪 你最初测到的
Give Mr. Fisher the first bearing

1148
01:17:10,593 --> 01:17:11,792
那航母的方位
you had on that flattop.

1149
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:13,494
方位 295 长官
295, sir.

1150
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:21,869
那是什么
What's that for?

1151
01:17:21,938 --> 01:17:23,304
吗啡 长官
Morphine, sir.

1152
01:17:23,373 --> 01:17:25,139
打一针会对你有帮助 长官
The shot would help you, sir.

1153
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:26,741
但对我的(鱼雷)发射没有帮助
It wouldn't help my shooting.

1154
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:30,978
你要靠辨别声音来发动攻击吗
Are you making a sound attack?

1155
01:17:31,047 --> 01:17:32,513
没错
That's right.

1156
01:17:32,582 --> 01:17:34,849
你知道 利用声音获得攻击机会
You know the chances of getting a hit

1157
01:17:34,917 --> 01:17:36,817
最后成功的几率只有1/8吗
with sound are about 1 in 8?

1158
01:17:36,886 --> 01:17:39,720
几率不是很理想 对吗？
Not very good odds, are they?

1159
01:17:41,391 --> 01:17:43,424
你想要退出吗 嗯
You want to quit? Uh-uh.

1160
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:47,395
不 我只是再确认一下你的计划 以防你突然晕倒
Just checking your plans, in case you pass out.

1161
01:17:47,463 --> 01:17:50,364
长官 我听到一些奇怪的声音
I'm getting some strange sounds, captain.

1162
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:10,685
你认为是什么
What do you make of it?

1163
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:14,488
我不知道
I don't know.

1164
01:18:14,557 --> 01:18:16,457
还很微弱
Pretty faint yet.

1165
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:19,260
方位
Bearing?

1166
01:18:22,665 --> 01:18:24,198
295
295.

1167
01:18:24,267 --> 01:18:27,468
调整航向至295
Come to course 295.

1168
01:18:27,537 --> 01:18:29,270
全速1/3
All ahead 1/3.

1169
01:18:34,377 --> 01:18:35,843
那是拉起锚链的声音
That's an anchor chain.

1170
01:18:35,912 --> 01:18:37,411
当然是
Of course it is.

1171
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:40,614
“士那若”号
<i> Shinaru.</i>

1172
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:44,218
对 它准备起锚出航了
Sure, she's getting underway.

1173
01:18:45,555 --> 01:18:46,921
他正试图赶快逃离
She's trying to bail out of there

1174
01:18:46,989 --> 01:18:48,656
免得被困住
before she gets caught.

1175
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:50,791
航向维持在 295
At 295 and holding.

1176
01:18:51,928 --> 01:18:53,227
很好
Very well.

1177
01:18:53,296 --> 01:18:54,662
长官 目标仍静止不动
Target still stationary, sir.

1178
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:56,163
距离1800码
1,800 yards.

1179
01:18:58,401 --> 01:19:01,202
进入战斗岗位 所有鱼雷发射管准备
Battle stations torpedo, make ready all bow tubes.

1180
01:19:02,004 --> 01:19:03,237
你能发射吗
Can you shoot?

1181
01:19:04,107 --> 01:19:05,372
我可以
I can.

1182
01:19:06,676 --> 01:19:07,842
你负责听声音
Take the sound.

1183
01:19:20,356 --> 01:19:22,423
有驱逐舰正快速驶来
Destroyer coming up fast.

1184
01:19:22,492 --> 01:19:24,558
又要故伎重施
Right in the groove again.

1185
01:19:24,627 --> 01:19:27,094
下潜就会失去发射机会
Dive and lose the shot or stay here

1186
01:19:27,163 --> 01:19:28,562
留在原地就会遭到攻击
and take the beating.

1187
01:19:29,866 --> 01:19:31,432
有可能会损失这船
Maybe lose the boat.

1188
01:19:35,037 --> 01:19:36,737
你会怎么做 斯隆先生
What would you do, Mr. Sloan?

1189
01:19:38,574 --> 01:19:40,241
你来决定
Your choice.

1190
01:19:40,309 --> 01:19:42,943
我是来学习的 记得吗
I came here to learn, remember?

1191
01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:46,013
所以我才问你
That's why I'm asking you.

1192
01:19:46,082 --> 01:19:47,681
你会怎么做
What would you do?

1193
01:19:50,686 --> 01:19:52,319
我会留下来攻击
I'd stay up and shoot.

1194
01:19:53,322 --> 01:19:54,789
这是我们来这儿的目的
That's what we're here for.

1195
01:19:54,857 --> 01:19:57,424
全都准备好了 长官
Group's ready, sir.

1196
01:19:57,493 --> 01:19:59,393
我们在距离一千码时发射六枚
We'll fire 6 at 1,000.

1197
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:01,962
我们可以随时发射 长官
We can fire anytime now, sir.

1198
01:20:02,031 --> 01:20:04,265
每多过一秒都会使成功率增加
Every second improves the shot.

1199
01:20:06,335 --> 01:20:07,868
你下令吧 阿奇
You can't, Arch.

1200
01:20:24,754 --> 01:20:26,287
它是你的 船长
She's yours, skipper.

1201
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:30,491
(不) 我们的
Ours.

1202
01:20:33,362 --> 01:20:34,662
你来做
You do it.

1203
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:40,067
去发射吧 阿奇
Go ahead and shoot, Arch.

1204
01:20:40,136 --> 01:20:41,869
快去
Go ahead.

1205
01:20:56,886 --> 01:20:58,252
全部发射 长官
All away, captain.

1206
01:20:59,822 --> 01:21:01,555
到目前为止 直奔目标而去
Running through the target so far?

1207
01:21:01,624 --> 01:21:02,857
希望如此
I hope.

1208
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:06,493
要是我没打中怎么办
What if I missed?

1209
01:21:07,964 --> 01:21:09,396
那算我们俩都没打中
That'll be two of us.

1210
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,600
海面上的攻击我们是躲不过去了
We aren't gonna miss the shellacking.

1211
01:21:12,668 --> 01:21:14,401
他们集中所有火力来对付我们
They're unloading the rack on us.

1212
01:21:47,003 --> 01:21:48,269
还要多久击中目标 福利
How long to target, Foley?

1213
01:21:48,337 --> 01:21:49,803
六秒 长官
6 seconds to go, sir.

1214
01:22:21,771 --> 01:22:23,370
(尖叫)
(screaming)

1215
01:22:24,206 --> 01:22:26,440
(爆炸)
(explosions)

1216
01:22:42,358 --> 01:22:45,592
(模糊的颤音)
(indistinct chatter)

1217
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:49,163
快点 快点
Move it! Move it!

1218
01:22:49,231 --> 01:22:52,865
(模糊的颤音)快到指挥舱去
(indistinct chatter)

1219
01:23:04,046 --> 01:23:04,979
好吧 上去
All right! Get up!

1220
01:23:05,047 --> 01:23:06,080
快点上去
Hurry! Up!

1221
01:23:51,293 --> 01:23:52,726
关不上了 巴尼
Can't close it, Barney!

1222
01:23:52,795 --> 01:23:54,061
给这里再加压50磅
Put 50 pounds of pressure in there!

1223
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:55,929
是 长官
Aye, sir!

1224
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:02,703
本森
Benson?

1225
01:24:12,615 --> 01:24:14,148
电瓶室暂时没问题
Forward battery rooms are all right,

1226
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:15,315
因为还有光线
we still got lights.

1227
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:16,984
戈尔迪 长官
Now, Goldy? Sir.

1228
01:24:17,053 --> 01:24:19,586
紧急呼叫蓝鳍金枪鱼号 做好准备 我们准备弃船
SOS<i>Bluefin</i>to stand by, we're abandoning ship.

1229
01:24:26,328 --> 01:24:27,528
我听不到任何声音 长官
I can't get anything, sir.

1230
01:24:27,596 --> 01:24:28,796
(爆炸)
(explosion)

1231
01:24:28,864 --> 01:24:30,264
只有...
All, I can--

1232
01:24:30,332 --> 01:24:31,565
等一下
Wait!

1233
01:24:31,634 --> 01:24:33,434
有鱼雷的声音
Listen, torpedoes!

1234
01:24:48,517 --> 01:24:50,918
它正在攻击驱逐舰 长官
She's fired at that destroyer, sir!

1235
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:03,831
继续呼叫蓝鳍金枪鱼号 继续呼叫
Keep calling the<i>Bluefin.</i> Keep calling!

1236
01:25:03,899 --> 01:25:05,599
情况怎么样 巴凯
What's the count, Mr. Buckeye?

1237
01:25:05,668 --> 01:25:07,000
我们这里有20个人 长官
Twenty here, sir, and the lot should be

1238
01:25:07,069 --> 01:25:08,969
眼下只有艇首鱼雷舱比较安全
safe in the forward torpedo room.

1239
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:11,672
继续呼叫
Keep calling.

1240
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:12,973
我正在发报 长官
I'm broadcasting, sir.

1241
01:25:30,126 --> 01:25:33,260
船长 角鲨号在呼救
Captain, I have an SOS from<i>Greyfish.</i>

1242
01:25:33,329 --> 01:25:34,394
他们在哪儿
Where are they?

1243
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:36,763
就在这里 长官
Right here, sir.

1244
01:25:36,832 --> 01:25:38,065
我们应该是在他们的正上方
We must be directly over them.

1245
01:25:38,134 --> 01:25:39,366
停车
All stop!

1246
01:25:39,435 --> 01:25:40,901
回应呼救
Now we can call.

1247
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:42,136
是 长官
