1
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:43,862
Bearing?

2
00:01:43,962 --> 00:01:44,863
Mark.

3
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:46,298
355.

4
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,637
Range?

5
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:52,738
Mark.

6
00:01:52,838 --> 00:01:55,041
MAN: 1000.

7
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:56,375
Ready?

8
00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:58,544
Firing point,
Captain.

9
00:01:58,644 --> 00:02:00,312
Fire 1!

10
00:02:06,152 --> 00:02:09,388
MAN: Number 1 running
hot straight north.

11
00:02:09,488 --> 00:02:12,258
Well, then we won't
waste another one.

12
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:25,171
A solid hit, sir!

13
00:02:26,672 --> 00:02:28,474
Want to confirm?

14
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:33,612
Nice shot,
right down the middle.

15
00:02:33,712 --> 00:02:35,581
You want to take
another look?

16
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:36,748
No.

17
00:02:41,887 --> 00:02:44,656
Surface for routine report
and wreckage examination.

18
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:48,160
Prepare to surface, look
out to the conning tower.

19
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,064
Well, Barney, that's another
one for the book.

20
00:02:52,164 --> 00:02:53,599
Yeah.

21
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,777
Great hit, captain.

22
00:03:05,877 --> 00:03:08,347
Nice shot, captain. Tankers
hit them where they really hurt.

23
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:10,749
No word from comms
up back yet, sir.

24
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:14,153
I'll be in my cabin.

25
00:03:14,253 --> 00:03:15,454
You'll have it, sir,
if I get it.

26
00:03:15,554 --> 00:03:17,689
I... I mean, when I get it.

27
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:23,295
Pretty rough on the skipper.

28
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:26,432
Sure is. Has he heard
anything about his family?

29
00:03:26,532 --> 00:03:29,401
Not a word since the Japanese
invaded Manila.

30
00:03:43,982 --> 00:03:45,551
( laughter )

31
00:03:46,885 --> 00:03:48,520
Let's light them up.

32
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,721
Here we go.

33
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,125
One...

34
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:54,860
two...

35
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,828
Close your eyes and
make a wish. There we are.

36
00:03:56,928 --> 00:03:58,264
Close your eyes. All
right, make a wish, darling.

37
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,832
Make a wish.
Blow.

38
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:03,435
Ooh, she has done it.

39
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,871
Well, here we go.

40
00:04:05,971 --> 00:04:08,974
One for each year,
this is for you, darling.

41
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,543
Barney.

42
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:13,579
Well, it's her birthday,
honey.

43
00:04:14,346 --> 00:04:15,447
Isn't it?

44
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:16,782
You don't mind, do you?

45
00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:21,753
Now some for everybody.

46
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:23,655
Teresa, as soon
as they finish,

47
00:04:23,755 --> 00:04:26,258
take them inside and start
opening the presents.

48
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,829
( music box playing )

49
00:04:30,929 --> 00:04:33,131
Thank you, daddy.

50
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,866
You want to hold it?

51
00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:47,179
Well, it was a very nice party
and we enjoyed being here.

52
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,714
Where do you think
you're going?

53
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:50,716
Well, we have to get
back to the base.

54
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:51,917
What?

55
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:53,619
Oh, no, you don't.

56
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:55,587
You and Arch have sunk
the whole enemy fleet

57
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:57,423
five times this month
in practice.

58
00:04:57,523 --> 00:04:59,057
Six, honey, six!

59
00:04:59,157 --> 00:05:01,092
I wasn't counting
doubleheaders.

60
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:02,694
I just got word this morning

61
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:04,596
they've commissioned
the Shinaru.

62
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:06,465
Their newest carrier,
is that straight dope, Barney?

63
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:08,400
That's why I was late.

64
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,637
You ought to leave them
one carrier for the real war.

65
00:05:11,737 --> 00:05:14,005
Arch...

66
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,642
you can bring me back a piece
of the Shinaru in this.

67
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,945
This afternoon
we're going fishing.

68
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:21,613
Well, if you say so.

69
00:05:21,713 --> 00:05:24,282
Well, if we're going fishing
let's get in the mood.

70
00:05:26,184 --> 00:05:28,019
Fair enough.

71
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,624
Cheers.

72
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,329
Commander Doyle!
Telephone!

73
00:05:37,429 --> 00:05:39,064
I'll get it.

74
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:43,269
Primo, I told you,
no telephone calls

75
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:44,803
for Commander Doyle today.

76
00:05:44,903 --> 00:05:46,838
The naval base
is very excited.

77
00:05:46,938 --> 00:05:48,807
They have to talk
to Commander Doyle,

78
00:05:48,907 --> 00:05:51,377
something
about Pearl Harbor.

79
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,289
What was that about?

80
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:04,556
Oh, the base said
it was important,

81
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,492
something about Pearl Harbor.

82
00:06:06,592 --> 00:06:09,328
Jane, I want you to take
Dede and get out of Manila

83
00:06:09,428 --> 00:06:11,263
just as quick as you can.

84
00:06:11,363 --> 00:06:13,865
Oh, Barney,
now not that again.

85
00:06:13,965 --> 00:06:16,335
Manila is my home,
I was born here and...

86
00:06:16,435 --> 00:06:18,770
and now it's our home.

87
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,940
You know as well as I do
what can happen here.

88
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,409
You know what's coming
now, don't you?

89
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:25,143
Yes, I know.

90
00:06:25,243 --> 00:06:28,647
But if these islands are
invaded, I'll take Teresa,

91
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:31,116
Primo, Dede,
we'll go up in the hills

92
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:33,084
and we'll be waiting
for you there.

93
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,354
Come on, darling, please
let's not spoil her birthday.

94
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,292
All right.

95
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:41,793
I want to call the base first.

96
00:07:02,614 --> 00:07:04,450
( imitating motor )

97
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,084
( laughter )

98
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:07,553
Nice big fat tanker, sir.

99
00:07:07,653 --> 00:07:09,421
Plenty of room
on that, sir.

100
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:15,827
Throw that net away.

101
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:19,831
What do you mean
throw it away?

102
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:21,433
That's mine.

103
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,573
Let's quit kidding
ourselves, huh?

104
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:30,409
Manila was captured
10 months ago.

105
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:35,246
That doesn't prove
that Jane was captured.

106
00:07:35,346 --> 00:07:37,383
Throw it away.

107
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:40,652
Barney, Jane knows
what she's doing.

108
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,588
She's probably hiding out
in the hills somewhere.

109
00:07:42,688 --> 00:07:44,656
As soon as she can
get word to ComSubPac,

110
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,224
they'll let us know,
believe me.

111
00:07:46,324 --> 00:07:47,826
I said throw it away!

112
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,428
Yes, sir.

113
00:07:59,004 --> 00:08:00,105
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,910
We're like a couple of kids
yelling at each other.

115
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,716
Let me buy you
some coffee, huh?

116
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:13,184
Al, bring us
some coffee, will you?

117
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,520
Aye aye, sir.

118
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:20,158
He's too tense.

119
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:21,593
Yeah.

120
00:08:21,693 --> 00:08:23,395
Well, he wasn't too
tense to get those.

121
00:08:23,495 --> 00:08:25,296
Well, I'll ride with him.

122
00:08:25,396 --> 00:08:26,565
That's big of you.

123
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:27,899
Where would you get off?

124
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,146
I have a radar contact
landmass bearing 256.

125
00:08:41,246 --> 00:08:42,848
256?

126
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,752
Got her.

127
00:08:46,852 --> 00:08:48,386
Captain to the conning tower.

128
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,855
Captain
to the conning tower.

129
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:04,736
Land contact, sir.

130
00:09:06,104 --> 00:09:07,405
What's our position?

131
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,707
Good old Fujiyama.

132
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:10,876
Well, we're home
again, captain.

133
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:12,043
Yeah.

134
00:09:15,814 --> 00:09:18,517
Land is one half miles
off, sir, bearing 273,

135
00:09:18,617 --> 00:09:20,085
we're in the mouth
of Suruga Bay.

136
00:09:21,753 --> 00:09:23,622
Well, you're a long way
from England, lieutenant.

137
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:25,423
That's the advantage
of ignorance, sir.

138
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,360
Lieutenant Redley, Royal Navy,
assigned to Grayfish,

139
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,163
for operational experience
of new sonar equipment.

140
00:09:32,263 --> 00:09:34,500
Well, it's our pleasure.
We expect to show you something

141
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,401
a lot more interesting
than mountains.

142
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:42,574
You will, sir. We're overdue
for some good clean fun,

143
00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:44,009
you've earned it, sir.

144
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:47,846
Left full rudder come
to course 185.

145
00:09:47,946 --> 00:09:49,648
Left full rudder, 185.
Bensy!

146
00:09:49,748 --> 00:09:50,816
No surface contact,
no aircraft contact.

147
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,217
Down scope.
Down scope.

148
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,421
Ready to surface, sir.

149
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:58,924
Belay that.
Now give me a sonar check.

150
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:01,426
Sound heads are rigged in,
sir, sonar not operating.

151
00:10:01,526 --> 00:10:03,695
There are no minefields
indicated in this area, captain.

152
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:05,664
Bring out the sound heads.

153
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:07,899
Stand by to surface.
Bring out the sound heads.

154
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,335
The Japs could have
a submarine here, Fisher.

155
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:13,071
That's right, I guess they
could. I'm sorry, captain.

156
00:10:16,507 --> 00:10:18,209
No contact
on sonar, sir.

157
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,781
Surface.
Surface, surface!

158
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:26,017
Lookouts to the bridge. Aye,
sir. Lookouts to the bridge.

159
00:10:26,117 --> 00:10:28,153
( siren blaring )

160
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:39,297
Break the hatch.
Break the hatch.

161
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:51,309
Mr. Foley?
Yes, sir?

162
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:53,111
You are the officer
of the deck, aren't you?

163
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:55,113
Yes, sir.
Then you know that the OD

164
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:56,548
is never the last
one to the bridge.

165
00:10:56,648 --> 00:10:58,383
Yes, sir.

166
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:08,794
Object sighted,
fishing sampan,

167
00:11:08,894 --> 00:11:11,730
10 degrees
off port bow, sir.

168
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,899
It's probably
a picket boat.

169
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:15,466
Let him send back
a report,

170
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:17,112
maybe they'll
send us out a target.

171
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,539
Haven't you found it yet,
Mr. Foley?

172
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,675
Yes, sir.

173
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,746
Sorry about being
late to the bridge, sir.

174
00:11:27,846 --> 00:11:29,380
Sorry is a word
for funerals.

175
00:11:30,682 --> 00:11:32,618
How late were you, Mr. Foley?

176
00:11:32,718 --> 00:11:35,921
About 10 seconds.
Ten seconds?

177
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:38,156
Well, I'm sure that you realize
a torpedo traveling

178
00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:41,993
at 50 knots makes 1/7
of a mile in 10 seconds?

179
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:44,295
Yes, sir.
Won't happen again, sir.

180
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,136
Say, cap, how about
having some coffee?

181
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,109
That's a good idea.

182
00:12:01,246 --> 00:12:03,148
Now that you have
the deck, Mr. Foley...

183
00:12:03,248 --> 00:12:04,650
Yes, sir.

184
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,684
Take care of it, huh?

185
00:12:05,784 --> 00:12:07,152
Thank you, sir.

186
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,128
( knocking on door )

187
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:22,433
Great news, admiral.

188
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,935
The Shinaru?

189
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,536
No, sir, not a trace.

190
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:27,005
Negative in five areas

191
00:12:27,105 --> 00:12:28,606
but others haven't
called in yet, sir.

192
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,208
What is your great news?

193
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:32,778
New list, sir. Confirmed
by the Swedish legation

194
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:35,146
of American civilian
prisoners of war.

195
00:12:35,246 --> 00:12:37,448
Commander Adams,
this is an operational office.

196
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:40,819
Sir, as of 2 weeks ago,

197
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:44,322
Barney Doyle's wife and baby
are alive and well.

198
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:46,024
Where?

199
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:49,160
The internment camp
at Callabo. Are you sure?

200
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,930
The Swedish reports
have been very reliable, sir.

201
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,299
Yes, they have.

202
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,101
Crack it off to Barney as
soon as you can raise him.

203
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:57,836
Get it through
and make it move.

204
00:12:57,936 --> 00:12:59,905
Yes, sir.

205
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,641
Adams!

206
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,176
Sir?

207
00:13:05,276 --> 00:13:07,078
Why are the enemy
telling us this now?

208
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:10,281
Well, the Swedes have been
trying for weeks, sir.

209
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:11,449
You know how the enemy is.

210
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:14,185
That's it.

211
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:15,821
Don't follow, sir.

212
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,322
When they tell us anything,

213
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,624
it's because
they want us to know.

214
00:13:19,724 --> 00:13:21,659
That's true, sir.

215
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,896
Why after all these months?
Why now?

216
00:13:24,996 --> 00:13:27,432
I don't know, sir.

217
00:13:27,532 --> 00:13:29,000
Neither do I.

218
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,903
Shall I hold
this information, sir?

219
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:35,440
No, Barney has
a right to know.

220
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,008
Aye aye, sir.

221
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,582
"Alive and well!"

222
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:46,718
Who? Who? Who?

223
00:13:46,818 --> 00:13:48,019
What?
Alive and well!

224
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,387
Who's alive and well?

225
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:50,655
Captain's wife and baby!

226
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:53,458
( indistinct chattering )

227
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,996
Didn't I tell you?

228
00:13:58,096 --> 00:13:59,931
Now all we need is
a piece of the Shinaru!

229
00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:02,067
That Callabo is still
an internment camp.

230
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:04,135
But it's the safest
place in the war, Barney.

231
00:14:04,235 --> 00:14:06,271
We hope.

232
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:08,473
Well, you still
want to get rest?

233
00:14:08,573 --> 00:14:10,641
Rest? Now? Ha!

234
00:14:10,741 --> 00:14:11,977
What about that
operational stuff?

235
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:13,478
We're alerted
to stand by,

236
00:14:13,578 --> 00:14:15,847
surface for something
urgent from ComSubPac.

237
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:18,149
Well, you heard him.
Right.

238
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:22,053
( knocking on door )

239
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:34,499
Adams, what's
the matter with you?

240
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:35,733
Oh, I'm fine, sir.

241
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,402
Seen a ghost?

242
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:38,837
The Shinaru, sir.

243
00:14:38,937 --> 00:14:41,172
Where?
Where, show me.

244
00:14:43,274 --> 00:14:46,577
Right here, sir,
headed northeast.

245
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,815
We've had three good fixes
and she outran them all,

246
00:14:49,915 --> 00:14:52,517
obviously headed
for Tokyo Bay.

247
00:14:52,617 --> 00:14:54,085
And Barney Doyle.

248
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,921
The Greyfish
is right there.

249
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:59,057
He's got her, Adams!

250
00:14:59,157 --> 00:15:00,591
He'll get a shot
at her, sir.

251
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,128
Shot? He'll ram her
if he has to.

252
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:06,097
Barney Doyle, if I could
have picked my man.

253
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:09,300
She's going
right down his throat.

254
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,369
This is going out
to him, of course.

255
00:15:11,469 --> 00:15:14,339
Sir, he's already got
the operational data but...

256
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:16,207
But what?

257
00:15:16,307 --> 00:15:18,444
I think you ought to read
the rest of that, sir.

258
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:27,518
Devils.

259
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,924
Those clever devils.

260
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:35,760
I'm afraid this explains
our great news, sir.

261
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,996
Too well.

262
00:15:38,096 --> 00:15:40,999
Barney got all of this yet?
No, sir.

263
00:15:41,099 --> 00:15:42,467
He's just getting
the operational stuff

264
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,335
on the Shinaru now.

265
00:15:44,435 --> 00:15:45,904
They think
they've hit the jackpot.

266
00:15:46,004 --> 00:15:47,305
Yeah.

267
00:15:50,641 --> 00:15:52,443
Message from Pearl.

268
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:54,445
The jackpot, sir.

269
00:15:55,646 --> 00:15:57,215
McKay!
Aye, sir.

270
00:15:57,315 --> 00:15:58,749
Relieve Mr. Foley
on the bridge.

271
00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:00,351
Aye, sir.

272
00:16:06,624 --> 00:16:09,460
Give me the shortest course
between here and Tokyo Bay.

273
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,728
Tokyo Bay?

274
00:16:10,828 --> 00:16:13,198
Yes, sir!

275
00:16:13,298 --> 00:16:14,866
All ahead full.
All ahead full, sir.

276
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:16,001
All ahead full.

277
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,402
( telephone ringing )

278
00:16:17,502 --> 00:16:19,104
Answer up,
all ahead full, sir.

279
00:16:19,204 --> 00:16:22,207
Mr. Foley!
Yes, sir?

280
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:23,909
Run tests on the torpedo
data computer

281
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:25,376
to make certain
it's operating perfectly.

282
00:16:25,476 --> 00:16:27,545
Recommended
course 061, sir.

283
00:16:27,645 --> 00:16:29,114
Very well.

284
00:16:29,214 --> 00:16:30,916
Down right to course 061.

285
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:32,717
061, sir.

286
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:38,156
Mr. Milligan,
send this message.

287
00:16:38,256 --> 00:16:40,391
Greyfish to ComSubPac.

288
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:41,959
Will do.

289
00:16:46,664 --> 00:16:50,268
Captain to crew,
upon reliable information

290
00:16:50,368 --> 00:16:52,737
we are moving to intercept
the Shinaru.

291
00:16:55,873 --> 00:16:57,308
The jackpot.

292
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:59,644
The Shinaru?
That's right.

293
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:01,746
Hey, chief,
what's all the excitement

294
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:03,114
about the Shinaru?

295
00:17:03,214 --> 00:17:04,715
It's just another flattop.

296
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,185
Just another flattop?
That's the number one target

297
00:17:07,285 --> 00:17:09,020
of the whole
United States Navy.

298
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,556
It led the attack against us
at Pearl Harbor.

299
00:17:20,598 --> 00:17:22,333
Well, that sets us up
just great, Barney.

300
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:24,035
We've got plenty
of depth there too.

301
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:25,971
Captain, another message
from ComSubPac.

302
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:27,072
Take it, Arch.

303
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,673
Yes, sir.

304
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:30,475
Checks out all right, sir.

305
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:32,243
Captain, the Shinaru
will undoubtedly

306
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,679
have a destroyer screen.
Undoubtedly?

307
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:36,948
Well, there might be chance
to prang one of them, too.

308
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:38,583
Well, of course
they're gonna be doing

309
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,685
a little pranging
of their own, lieutenant.

310
00:17:40,785 --> 00:17:41,752
Yes, it won't be dull.

311
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,853
I'm sure of that.

312
00:17:42,953 --> 00:17:44,489
Barney.
Huh?

313
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:57,802
Read it to all hands.

314
00:18:04,342 --> 00:18:06,611
This is the exec speaking
for the captain.

315
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:10,982
I'm gonna read you a message
just received from ComSubPac.

316
00:18:11,082 --> 00:18:12,717
Quote.

317
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:15,320
"Information considered
reliable here verified screen

318

322
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:30,368
Go ahead.

00:18:41,546 --> 00:18:44,215
from camp Callabo
to Japanese mainland."

328
00:18:45,116 --> 00:18:46,517
End of quote.

329
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,501
This is the captain.

330
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,971
I will remind
every man in this crew

331
00:19:07,071 --> 00:19:09,074
that we're trained
to penetrate the enemy's

332
00:19:09,174 --> 00:19:11,609
protective screens
and shields.

333
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:14,745
Barney, ComSubPac didn't
say we have to attack.

334
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:17,348
Why should they?

335
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,749
That's what we're here for.

336
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:20,285
Barney!

337
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:23,821
Can I have a word with you?

338
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,460
Notify the bridge
I'm going below.

339
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,462
Bridge,
captain going below.

340
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,274
Well?

341
00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:48,313
Barney, I came up
through the hose pipe.

342
00:19:48,413 --> 00:19:50,081
I've held every job
in these boats,

343
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:53,984
enlisted man to officer,
except skipper.

344
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:56,387
You'd make a good one.

345
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,942
Well, this is something other
people should say for me,

346
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:03,361
but I can handle
this boat right now.

347
00:20:03,461 --> 00:20:05,371
Well, you wouldn't be
here if you couldn't.

348
00:20:07,465 --> 00:20:10,835
Barney, this attack
is more than just routine.

349
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:15,173
Well, they all are.

350
00:20:15,273 --> 00:20:19,277
The message said
all 1,400 prisoners.

351
00:20:19,377 --> 00:20:21,812
Your wife and baby
are on that transport.

352
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:29,454
We are attacking
the Shinaru.

353
00:20:32,257 --> 00:20:34,459
Barney,
this is not an accident.

354
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,161
Where do you think
that transport will be

355
00:20:36,261 --> 00:20:37,762
when you have to shoot?

356
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,064
They're deliberately
using her for a screen,

357
00:20:40,164 --> 00:20:41,732
and they've got
two destroyers.

358
00:20:41,832 --> 00:20:45,370
It'll be tough even getting
close enough to shoot!

359
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,206
Don't you think I know that?

360
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:53,210
Barney, if we must
shoot, let me do it.

361
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,447
That'll be all, Arch.

362
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,441
That big one sure
could be our flattop.

363
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,510
The next big one,
the transport,

364
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,645
that's the destroyer ahead,
another one astern of the force.

365
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,380
Range 9 miles.

366
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,787
Bridge!

367
00:21:36,887 --> 00:21:38,223
Bridge, aye!

368
00:21:38,323 --> 00:21:39,290
Dive the boat!

369
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,391
Little bridge!

370
00:21:40,491 --> 00:21:41,926
Dive!
Dive!

371
00:21:42,026 --> 00:21:44,429
( honking twice )

372
00:22:03,848 --> 00:22:05,283
Well, that was fast.

373
00:22:05,383 --> 00:22:06,484
Too fast.

374
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:07,985
Hustle and bustle, boy.

375
00:22:17,194 --> 00:22:18,128
All ahead 2/3.

376
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:19,830
All ahead 2/3, sir.

377
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,199
Cycle the vents.

378
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,503
Cycle the vents!

379
00:22:25,603 --> 00:22:27,505
All vents cycled
and shut, sir!

380
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,161
Battle stations torpedo.

381
00:22:51,261 --> 00:22:52,763
Battle stations torpedo.

382
00:22:52,863 --> 00:22:54,832
( bell ringing )

383
00:22:59,303 --> 00:23:00,705
Bearing, mark.

384
00:23:00,805 --> 00:23:01,706
060.

385
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:02,907
Range, mark.

386
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,442
6000.

387
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,512
Angle in the ballast
starboard 10.

388
00:23:08,746 --> 00:23:10,180
What about that transport?

389
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,649
Same speed, same range.

390
00:23:11,749 --> 00:23:14,285
Estimate 1,200 yards
and starboard beam.

391
00:23:14,385 --> 00:23:16,220
That's close,
Barney, too close.

392
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,789
The Shinaru's indicated
at doing 23 knots.

393
00:23:18,889 --> 00:23:21,292
True bearing
of the carrier is 294.

394
00:23:21,392 --> 00:23:24,295
We're 3 minutes from firing
point if you plan on firing

395
00:23:24,395 --> 00:23:25,630
at 1,200 yards, sir.

396
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,365
Make it 1,000.
Yes, sir.

397
00:23:27,465 --> 00:23:30,000
Destroyer is changing course.

398
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:33,838
She's heading toward us.

399
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,914
She's pinging on long scale

400
00:23:44,014 --> 00:23:45,783
but I don't think
she's picked us up yet.

401
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:48,519
Give her time, old chap.
It's hard work up there.

402
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,322
Rig for silent running.

403
00:23:51,422 --> 00:23:52,857
Rig for silent running.

404
00:23:52,957 --> 00:23:54,825
Steady as you go.
Steady as you go, sir.

405
00:23:54,925 --> 00:23:56,861
Make ready all forward tubes
except for outer doors.

406
00:23:56,961 --> 00:23:59,129
Forward tubes are ready,
sir, except for outer doors.

407
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:04,134
Very well. We'll try a spread
of 6. Take the scope, Archie.

408
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,036
Aye, sir.

409
00:24:19,684 --> 00:24:22,152
Bearing, mark!

410
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,421
068.

411
00:24:23,521 --> 00:24:26,090
Range, mark!

412
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,492
1880!

413
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:29,427
She's picked us up.

414
00:24:29,527 --> 00:24:31,796
She's heading right
down our throats.

415
00:24:33,498 --> 00:24:35,666
Set all torpedoes
for 12 feet.

416
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:38,969
High speed, 2 degree spread.

417
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:41,071
One minute
to firing point, sir.

418
00:24:41,171 --> 00:24:43,741
All tubes ready, sir, except
for outer doors. Very well.

419
00:24:43,841 --> 00:24:45,643
Destroyer approaching
at high speed.

420
00:25:01,526 --> 00:25:03,461
Open outer doors.
Open outer doors.

421
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:05,696
Up scope,
this is a shooting observation.

422
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:10,501
She's signaling.

423
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:12,069
Bearing, mark!

424
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:13,337
076.

425
00:25:13,437 --> 00:25:14,805
Range, mark!

426
00:25:14,905 --> 00:25:16,574
1300!

427
00:25:16,674 --> 00:25:18,676
30 seconds to firing
point, sir. On the bow?

428
00:25:18,776 --> 00:25:20,778
10 degrees port,
but we can't shoot,

429
00:25:20,878 --> 00:25:22,713
we'd hit the Yoshida Maru.
Confirmed, sir.

430
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:25,082
A six-torpedo spread
would hit the transport.

431
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:32,289
Chance for another setup?

432
00:25:32,389 --> 00:25:34,258
Doubt it, chief.
20 seconds!

433
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,364
How many fish can you fire
without hitting the transport?

434
00:25:40,464 --> 00:25:41,966
Two, sir, possibly.

435
00:25:43,568 --> 00:25:45,470
Barney, you can't.

436
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,838
I wouldn't risk it, sir.
Nobody asked you to.

437
00:25:47,938 --> 00:25:50,340
It's too close
even for two fish.

438
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,242
Destroyer approaching
at high speed.

439
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:56,514
Bearing 042,
range 1,500 yards.

440
00:25:56,614 --> 00:25:57,648
Steady as you go.

441
00:25:57,748 --> 00:25:59,216
Steady as you go, sir.

442
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,719
Bow tubes stand by.

443
00:26:01,819 --> 00:26:03,521
Bow tubes
are standing by, sir.

444
00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:08,092
Barney, it's Jane and Dede.

445
00:26:12,296 --> 00:26:13,564
10 seconds to shoot!

446
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,401
You... You can't.

447
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:18,869
Firing point!
Fire.

448
00:26:18,969 --> 00:26:20,971
Barney!
Barney!

449
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,578
Number one running hot,
straight and normal, sir.

450
00:26:31,148 --> 00:26:34,084
Number two running hot,
straight and normal.

451
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,402
That's a bit of all right.

452
00:26:52,502 --> 00:26:53,804
I hope so.

453
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,840
Either way he is right.

454
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,809
You want to take a look to
confirm it, don't you, Barney?

455
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,444
We better take
her down deep, sir,

456
00:27:00,544 --> 00:27:01,779
the destroyer
is almost on us.

457
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:04,348
You've got to confirm, Barney.

458
00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:13,658
Close the outer doors.

459
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,560
Close the outer doors.

460
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,461
Rig for depth charge.
Rig for depth charge.

461
00:27:17,561 --> 00:27:18,896
Down emergency,
left full rudder.

462
00:27:18,996 --> 00:27:21,365
Left full rudder.
All ahead full.

463
00:27:31,676 --> 00:27:33,711
Answer up all ahead full!

464
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:36,146
How deep can you go?
We've got 96 fathoms.

465
00:27:36,246 --> 00:27:38,515
Take her down to 300 feet.
Take her down to 300 feet.

466
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,517
300 feet, aye, sir.

467
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,287
At least they're
running straight.

468
00:27:43,387 --> 00:27:45,322
What's the time
on number one?

469
00:27:45,422 --> 00:27:46,591
Ten seconds to go, sir.

470
00:27:46,691 --> 00:27:48,125
Rudder left full, sir.

471
00:27:59,536 --> 00:28:00,771
Number one missed!

472
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,744
( explosions )

473
00:28:51,488 --> 00:28:53,157
( indistinct chatter )

474
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:02,432
( indistinct chatter )

475
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:05,269
How long to number two?

476
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,938
8 seconds to hit
the Shinaru, sir.

477
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,076
How many to... How many
to miss the transport?

478
00:29:12,176 --> 00:29:13,878
2 seconds, sir.

479
00:29:13,978 --> 00:29:15,980
( explosion )

480
00:29:20,484 --> 00:29:23,320
It could have been a premature
explosion, captain.

481
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,123
It could have been.

482
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,491
No, sir.

483
00:29:42,306 --> 00:29:44,208
( explosions )

484
00:30:21,578 --> 00:30:25,783
I assume they've lost us
for the moment, captain.

485
00:30:25,883 --> 00:30:27,952
At 300 feet, sir.

486
00:30:32,022 --> 00:30:33,858
Noise from the transport, sir.

487
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:36,560
She's breaking up.

488
00:30:38,863 --> 00:30:40,264
Water's rushing in.

489
00:30:42,499 --> 00:30:43,901
Bulkheads are crushing.

490
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,022
Reverse course.

491
00:31:05,122 --> 00:31:07,758
Reverse course.
Right full rudder.

492
00:31:07,858 --> 00:31:09,059
Bring her up to 60 feet.

493
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,594
Bring her up to 60 feet.

494
00:31:10,694 --> 00:31:12,029
60 feet, aye, sir!

495
00:31:23,773 --> 00:31:26,276
The destroyers
are waiting, captain.

496
00:31:26,376 --> 00:31:28,512
I know that.

497
00:31:28,612 --> 00:31:30,514
At 60 feet and holding, sir.

498
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,320
What about that transport?

499
00:32:12,322 --> 00:32:15,292
Those destroyers are waiting
for us to pick up survivors.

500
00:32:17,794 --> 00:32:19,396
They're using them as bait.

501
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:25,102
Well?

502
00:32:29,473 --> 00:32:30,574
Let's get out of here.

503
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:33,610
You take over, Arch.

504
00:32:35,712 --> 00:32:37,814
Control room, 80 feet.

505
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,016
80 feet, aye, sir.

506
00:32:39,116 --> 00:32:41,151
5 degrees down.

507
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:45,589
Passing 095, sir.

508
00:32:45,689 --> 00:32:47,257
Steady on 125.

509
00:32:47,357 --> 00:32:48,625
125, aye, sir.

510
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,729
That's enough,
thanks very much.

511
00:33:37,074 --> 00:33:38,008
Where's Arch?

512
00:33:38,108 --> 00:33:39,509
Telephone he said.

513
00:33:39,609 --> 00:33:42,980
Yeah, he's been
gone a half hour.

514
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,748
31 minutes.

515
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:50,587
He's not coming back until
I signal, I bribed him.

516
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:53,223
You what?

517
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,692
I bribed him.
No, you didn't.

518
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:57,727
No, you didn't do that,
that's impossible.

519
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,663
You can't bribe Arch.

520
00:33:59,763 --> 00:34:01,265
You don't know
what I offered.

521
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:07,037
Barney, what's
the word you use

522
00:34:07,137 --> 00:34:09,506
when one of your ships
protects the other?

523
00:34:09,606 --> 00:34:12,376
Ah, it's called screening.
Oh, yes.

524
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:13,910
You know, when you
have one ship,

525
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,212
you want to protect
another ship...

526
00:34:15,312 --> 00:34:16,713
The principle
is very clear.

527
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:18,215
Ship in front.

528
00:34:18,315 --> 00:34:21,018
I'm tired of being
screened, Barney.

529
00:34:21,118 --> 00:34:23,053
For 5 months, you've
kept Arch between us

530
00:34:23,153 --> 00:34:25,422
like a chaperone, why?

531
00:34:29,393 --> 00:34:32,729
Because I love you,
Jane, that's why.

532
00:34:35,132 --> 00:34:37,301
That's a good start, go on.

533
00:34:40,837 --> 00:34:42,439
I'm a bad risk.

534
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,641
Who's taking it?
You or me?

535
00:34:46,143 --> 00:34:48,212
No.

536
00:34:48,312 --> 00:34:50,814
Is it because there is going
to be a war and we'll be in it?

537
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:53,517
Well, I've thought a lot
about that too, Barney,

538
00:34:53,617 --> 00:34:55,252
for the past 5 months.

539
00:34:55,352 --> 00:34:59,189
And if it all happens just
exactly as you say it will,

540
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:01,291
I still want a duplicate
of you.

541
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:08,398
I kind of figured that I'd like
to have a little girl first.

542
00:35:08,498 --> 00:35:10,734
Well, fine then let's
get the family started

543
00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:15,139
before it's too late.

544
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,041
Are you sure?

545
00:35:17,141 --> 00:35:19,075
Really sure
that's what you want?

546
00:35:20,477 --> 00:35:23,380
I've already promised
Archie could be godfather.

547
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:37,994
Exactly 34 minutes
and 10 seconds.

548
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,030
And 5 months.

549
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,565
And all the rest
of our lives.

550
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,112
( knocking on door )

551
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,283
Yes?

552
00:36:01,885 --> 00:36:02,952
Watch it, it's a little hot.

553
00:36:03,052 --> 00:36:05,555
Thanks.

554
00:36:05,655 --> 00:36:06,723
Thanks, Arch.

555
00:36:09,193 --> 00:36:10,327
Barney,
can I say something?

556
00:36:10,427 --> 00:36:13,930
Yeah, yeah, what?

557
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,332
I couldn't have done it.

558
00:36:17,567 --> 00:36:19,135
Well, you didn't have to.

559
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,406
Jane would have
wanted you to try it.

560
00:36:27,611 --> 00:36:28,812
Yeah.

561
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:35,619
Hey, come on.

562
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:37,521
Come on,
sit down right here.

563
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,330
Well, who...
Who has the deck?

564
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,698
Foley.
Uh-huh.

565
00:36:48,798 --> 00:36:52,169
Well, he's learning,
that boy, huh?

566
00:36:52,269 --> 00:36:53,570
So am I.

567
00:36:58,308 --> 00:37:00,043
I gave those two
destroyers a slip

568
00:37:00,143 --> 00:37:02,246
and reloaded and reported
to ComSubPac.

569
00:37:03,747 --> 00:37:04,881
What did they say?

570
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:09,553
Recommendation to return
to Pearl Harbor at once.

571
00:37:13,557 --> 00:37:15,859
What else?
What else, sarge?

572
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:19,229
Nothing else, just a routine
sinking report.

573
00:37:19,329 --> 00:37:22,566
I signed your name.

574
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:24,134
Thanks.

575
00:37:24,234 --> 00:37:26,736
Barney, let's head back
to Pearl Harbor.

576
00:37:29,673 --> 00:37:33,343
We still have 16
torpedoes left, haven't we?

577
00:37:33,443 --> 00:37:34,944
That's right.

578
00:37:39,749 --> 00:37:41,685
Well, they don't need
them at Pearl.

579
00:38:01,471 --> 00:38:03,072
Battle stations torpedo.

580
00:38:03,172 --> 00:38:04,608
Battle stations torpedo.

581
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:06,276
( bell ringing )

582
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,015
Take a look at that setup.

583
00:38:18,555 --> 00:38:21,491
If they spot us on the shoals,
we'll be in trouble.

584
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,927
Let's head for deep water.

585
00:38:24,027 --> 00:38:25,094
Nope.

586
00:38:25,194 --> 00:38:27,931
Are you going to attack?

587
00:38:28,031 --> 00:38:29,366
Not that outfit.

588
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,022
Bearing? Mark!

589
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,258
350.

590
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:56,926
Range? Mark!

591
00:38:57,026 --> 00:38:58,362
1500.

592
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,832
Make ready all bow tubes.
Make ready all bow tubes.

593
00:39:02,932 --> 00:39:04,501
Hang on the bow,
starboard 30,

594
00:39:04,601 --> 00:39:07,437
set torpedoes
at high speed, depth 6 feet.

595
00:39:07,537 --> 00:39:08,838
It's gonna be a straight
bow shot.

596
00:39:08,938 --> 00:39:11,608
We're on the firing
bearing now, sir.

597
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:12,976
Range 1,000.

598
00:39:13,076 --> 00:39:14,378
Shoot.

599
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,817
One fired, sir.

600
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:23,687
Captain, what are
we shooting at?

601
00:39:23,787 --> 00:39:25,589
Net tender.

602
00:39:25,689 --> 00:39:26,523
Hmm?

603
00:39:26,623 --> 00:39:28,324
Their nets are still open.

604
00:39:29,726 --> 00:39:31,127
Give me the time, Foley.

605
00:39:31,227 --> 00:39:32,496
6 seconds!

606
00:39:39,135 --> 00:39:40,770
( explosion )

607
00:39:42,972 --> 00:39:44,974
Solid hit.

608
00:39:47,911 --> 00:39:49,813
Come to course 045.

609
00:39:49,913 --> 00:39:51,648
Right full rudder,
all ahead full.

610
00:39:51,748 --> 00:39:55,552
045, right full rudder,
all ahead full, aye, sir!

611
00:39:55,652 --> 00:39:57,787
( siren wailing )

612
00:40:10,266 --> 00:40:11,901
The destroyer's made
a turn, captain.

613
00:40:12,001 --> 00:40:14,003
She found us yet?

614
00:40:14,103 --> 00:40:15,672
Through that?

615
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,746
Makes an open room.

616
00:40:25,081 --> 00:40:27,083
We're going through.

617
00:40:49,673 --> 00:40:51,140
Keep us in the clear.

618
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:53,810
Aye aye, sir.

619
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:57,413
We're going
into Tokyo Bay?

620
00:40:58,882 --> 00:41:01,585
Not going, sir,
we are in.

621
00:41:13,997 --> 00:41:15,031
Tell them, Jojo.

622
00:41:16,165 --> 00:41:17,601
From captain to crew.

623
00:41:17,701 --> 00:41:19,068
We've entered Tokyo Bay.

624
00:41:20,704 --> 00:41:22,038
What if they find out that...

625
00:41:22,138 --> 00:41:23,540
Shh.

626
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:28,177
First American sub
in Tokyo Bay.

627
00:41:29,345 --> 00:41:30,514
How about dinner, Foley?

628
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:34,017
Great, if it's a round trip.

629
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:36,152
( radar pinging )

630
00:41:36,252 --> 00:41:37,787
Mines dead ahead.

631
00:41:42,225 --> 00:41:43,927
Take us down fast!

632
00:41:44,027 --> 00:41:47,731
95 feet, left full rudder,
come to course 005.

633
00:41:47,831 --> 00:41:51,134
Left full rudder,
005, aye, sir.

634
00:41:51,234 --> 00:41:53,202
95 feet, aye, sir.

635
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,471
Rudder is left full, sir.

636
00:42:21,798 --> 00:42:23,667
Contact to stern
coming up fast, sir.

637
00:42:24,568 --> 00:42:26,002
It's a destroyer pinging.

638
00:42:26,102 --> 00:42:27,637
Steady as you go.

639
00:42:27,737 --> 00:42:29,873
Steady as you go, aye, sir.

640
00:42:42,652 --> 00:42:46,089
Don't any of you chaps
find it a trifle warm?

641
00:42:47,657 --> 00:42:49,793
Do you want to go
sightseeing, sir?

642
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,528
It seemed
a good idea then.

643
00:43:10,179 --> 00:43:11,214
All ahead dead slow.

644
00:43:11,314 --> 00:43:12,716
All ahead dead slow, sir.

645
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:49,519
The tin can is closing fast,
700 yards, sir.

646
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:51,555
He's following us
into the minefields.

647
00:43:51,655 --> 00:43:54,123
He is a fool coming in here.

648
00:43:54,223 --> 00:43:56,726
You could say he
has guts too, sir.

649
00:43:56,826 --> 00:43:59,162
Well, he won't
have them long.

650
00:44:03,733 --> 00:44:05,601
( explosion )

651
00:44:13,977 --> 00:44:16,045
He's a happy warrior.

652
00:44:17,981 --> 00:44:19,515
Left standard rudder.

653
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,685
Left standard
rudder, aye, sir.

654
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,854
Better get back
into the channel.

655
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,290
If we can make the channel,
we'd have 150 feet

656
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,858
of good water, captain.

657
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,770
( metal clanging )

658
00:44:50,413 --> 00:44:52,882
Sounds like we fouled
a mine cable up forward.

659
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:55,952
All stop, all back emergency,
rudder amidships.

660
00:44:56,052 --> 00:44:59,288
All stop, all back emergency,
rudder amidships, aye, sir.

661
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:28,685
All stop.

662
00:45:28,785 --> 00:45:30,687
All stop.

663
00:45:30,787 --> 00:45:31,721
All ahead dead slow.

664
00:45:31,821 --> 00:45:33,689
All ahead dead slow.

665
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:56,579
Come to course 335.

666
00:45:56,679 --> 00:45:58,982
335, aye, sir!

667
00:46:29,445 --> 00:46:30,780
Beautiful, sir.

668
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,548
I wouldn't have missed that.

669
00:46:32,648 --> 00:46:34,918
I would.

670
00:46:37,486 --> 00:46:39,355
How do you feel, Benson?

671
00:46:39,455 --> 00:46:41,290
I haven't felt
for an hour, sir.

672
00:46:42,792 --> 00:46:44,828
There's a faint sound, sir.

673
00:46:45,895 --> 00:46:47,363
Nothing close anyway.

674
00:46:47,463 --> 00:46:51,034
We got room to turn
seaward now, captain.

675
00:46:51,134 --> 00:46:53,903
Steady as you go.
Steady as you go, aye, sir.

676
00:46:54,003 --> 00:46:56,773
Bring us up to 62 feet.

677
00:46:56,873 --> 00:46:58,274
62 feet, aye, sir!

678
00:47:01,677 --> 00:47:03,212
Going through.

679
00:47:03,312 --> 00:47:05,314
But if they close
the nets behind us?

680
00:47:05,414 --> 00:47:09,318
Oh, that's all that
sound is, sir.

681
00:47:09,418 --> 00:47:11,087
All?

682
00:47:30,439 --> 00:47:31,775
But...

683
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:33,910
if the nets are closed...

684
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:35,945
Tokyo is a big town, sir.

685
00:47:36,045 --> 00:47:37,881
We'll find a boarding house.

686
00:47:41,017 --> 00:47:42,518
At periscope depth,
captain.

687
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:47,423
Any contacts with stern?

688
00:47:47,523 --> 00:47:48,591
No contact, sir.

689
00:47:52,695 --> 00:47:54,663
Take it up.

690
00:47:54,763 --> 00:47:56,732
Straight out ahead,
minefield to port.

691
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:57,934
Mark it on the chart,
Mr. Fisher,

692
00:47:58,034 --> 00:47:59,302
for the round trip.

693
00:47:59,402 --> 00:48:01,104
Marking it now, sir.

694
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,213
You got her, huh?

695
00:48:11,814 --> 00:48:13,149
Look.

696
00:48:18,554 --> 00:48:19,889
The Shinaru, gentlemen.

697
00:48:25,461 --> 00:48:27,263
Battle stations torpedo,
make ready all bow tubes.

698
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,465
Battle stations torpedo,
make ready all bow tubes.

699
00:48:29,565 --> 00:48:30,800
( bell ringing )

700
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,368
All tubes ready, sir.

701
00:48:35,438 --> 00:48:37,240
Bearing, mark.

702
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,241
338.

703
00:48:38,341 --> 00:48:40,143
Range, mark.

704
00:48:40,243 --> 00:48:41,310
1500.

705
00:48:42,478 --> 00:48:43,779
Destroyer cutting in.

706
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,014
Range will be perfect
in 8 seconds.

707
00:48:45,114 --> 00:48:46,382
We haven't got 8 seconds.

708
00:48:46,482 --> 00:48:47,550
Commence firing.

709
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:49,018
Fire!

710
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:57,961
All six fired, sir.
Take her down fast.

711
00:48:58,061 --> 00:48:59,295
Take her down fast!
Left full rudder.

712
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:00,663
Left full rudder,
aye, sir.

713
00:49:11,807 --> 00:49:14,978
The destroyer is intercepting
our torpedoes, captain!

714
00:49:22,018 --> 00:49:23,519
( siren wailing )

715
00:49:33,662 --> 00:49:35,932
Missed.

716
00:49:36,032 --> 00:49:37,566
We missed.

717
00:49:38,867 --> 00:49:39,969
Rotten luck.

718
00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:42,105
Contact, here we go again.

719
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,052
( explosions )

720
00:50:22,345 --> 00:50:24,914
The upper hatch
is sprung!

721
00:50:25,014 --> 00:50:26,649
See if you can dock it down!

722
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:31,020
( groans )

723
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,455
Get him up on the bunk.

724
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:36,392
Pharmacist's mate
to forward torpedo room.

725
00:50:50,406 --> 00:50:52,608
Ease your bubble to zero!

726
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:10,226
Buckeye, check for damage!

727
00:51:10,326 --> 00:51:12,095
All compartments, report in!

728
00:51:12,195 --> 00:51:14,230
Wait a minute!

729
00:51:18,067 --> 00:51:20,136
Forward torpedo room
to conning tower,

730
00:51:20,236 --> 00:51:22,105
we have one man knocked out
and are taking water

731
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:23,539
but we'll handle it.

732
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:25,374
You check on the damage.

733
00:51:25,474 --> 00:51:28,611
Hallert, get 50 pounds
of pressure in there,

734
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:30,379
reload those tubes fast
and clear the room

735
00:51:30,479 --> 00:51:32,448
except for yourself
and one man.

736
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:34,783
( explosions )

737
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,827
Flooding under
control, Barney.

738
00:51:44,927 --> 00:51:46,962
Pressure in the room is
holding, tubes are reloaded,

739
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,431
Hallert and one man
standing by.

740
00:51:48,531 --> 00:51:52,035
Destroyer is all
over us, captain.

741
00:51:52,135 --> 00:51:54,337
I'm all right.

742
00:51:54,437 --> 00:51:58,507
How close are we
to the minefield?

743
00:51:58,607 --> 00:52:01,077
Estimate 600 yards
starboard, sir.

744
00:52:01,177 --> 00:52:02,645
Well, run down the Bay,

745
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:04,680
keep us close to that
minefield as possible.

746
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:05,848
Aye, sir.

747
00:52:14,823 --> 00:52:17,126
That destroyer
is laying back, sir.

748
00:52:17,226 --> 00:52:19,695
Maybe doesn't want
to see his ancestors.

749
00:52:22,398 --> 00:52:24,333
Captain,
may I say something?

750
00:52:26,469 --> 00:52:28,037
Well, if there's time.

751
00:52:28,137 --> 00:52:30,306
In the Skagerak one night

752
00:52:30,406 --> 00:52:32,575
Germany boats
chased us into a minefield

753
00:52:32,675 --> 00:52:34,543
and we made them
think they'd killed us

754
00:52:34,643 --> 00:52:38,314
by exploding one
of their own mines.

755
00:52:38,414 --> 00:52:40,216
With what, good wishes?

756
00:52:40,316 --> 00:52:41,984
Not that we were
saving those.

757
00:52:42,084 --> 00:52:43,786
We used our stern tubes, sir.

758
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,033
Stern tubes stand by.

759
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,502
Stern tubes stand by.

760
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:02,771
Stern tubes ready, sir.

761
00:53:02,871 --> 00:53:04,240
Set gyro at 90 degrees.

762
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,409
Set gyro at 90 degrees.

763
00:53:06,509 --> 00:53:07,876
Gyro set at 90 degrees, sir.

764
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:13,849
Fire all four.

765
00:53:13,949 --> 00:53:15,184
All four fired, sir.

766
00:53:28,731 --> 00:53:30,433
( explosion )

767
00:53:39,908 --> 00:53:41,877
All stop.
All stop.

768
00:53:41,977 --> 00:53:43,379
All stop, aye, sir!

769
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:52,488
Goldy?

770
00:53:52,588 --> 00:53:54,423
The destroyer
is turning away, sir.

771
00:53:57,326 --> 00:53:58,794
He is heading
back up the bay.

772
00:53:58,894 --> 00:54:01,330
The sound is fading.

773
00:54:02,565 --> 00:54:03,932
I think we're okay.

774
00:54:05,501 --> 00:54:07,236
By golly, it worked.

775
00:54:08,937 --> 00:54:11,039
Hey, Redley.

776
00:54:11,139 --> 00:54:13,676
I thought you came
here to learn from us.

777
00:54:13,776 --> 00:54:15,344
I have, sir.

778
00:54:15,444 --> 00:54:17,780
But I'm expected to take
the information back.

779
00:54:20,449 --> 00:54:21,850
Well, Fuzz, we made it.

780
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:24,119
Yeah.

781
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,554
To the nets.

782
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:33,229
Forward torpedo room.

783
00:54:33,329 --> 00:54:34,730
Open outer doors.

784
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:36,632
Forward torpedo room,
open outer doors.

785
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,640
Nets 700 yards ahead, sir.

786
00:54:46,675 --> 00:54:48,677
Fire all bow torpedoes,
no spacing.

787
00:55:07,363 --> 00:55:08,931
( explosion )

788
00:55:11,534 --> 00:55:12,701
Close outer doors.

789
00:55:12,801 --> 00:55:13,802
Close outer doors.

790
00:55:13,902 --> 00:55:15,070
All ahead standard.

791
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:16,872
All ahead standard, aye, sir!

792
00:55:46,435 --> 00:55:47,770
We're in the clear.

793
00:56:00,115 --> 00:56:02,418
Well, thanks.

794
00:56:05,087 --> 00:56:06,455
Thanks for all of us.

795
00:56:06,555 --> 00:56:07,856
Thank you, sir.

796
00:56:09,458 --> 00:56:10,926
Recommend course
185, captain.

797
00:56:11,026 --> 00:56:12,395
Very well.

798
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:13,862
Come to course 185.

799
00:56:13,962 --> 00:56:15,398
185, aye, sir.

800
00:56:17,966 --> 00:56:20,569
Secure from battle stations,
repair battle damage.

801
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:24,139
Secure all battle stations,
repair all battle damage.

802
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:25,341
Keep me informed, Arch.

803
00:56:25,441 --> 00:56:26,742
Aye, sir.

804
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:14,056
( music box playing )

805
00:57:18,994 --> 00:57:21,397
JANE: Oh, what did you
say to daddy, Dede?

806
00:57:21,497 --> 00:57:23,399
DEDE: Thank you, daddy.

807
00:57:23,499 --> 00:57:25,634
You want to hold it?

808
00:57:28,303 --> 00:57:29,872
JANE: Yes, I know.

809
00:57:29,972 --> 00:57:31,674
But if these islands
are invaded,

810
00:57:31,774 --> 00:57:34,810
I'll take Teresa,
Primo and Dede,

811
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:38,080
we'll go up in the hills and
we'll be waiting for you there.

812
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,916
Come on, darling, please
let's not spoil her birthday.

813
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:16,852
He's still asleep, Al.

814
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:18,721
Yes, sir, I know, sir,
but he ain't had a bite.

815
00:58:18,821 --> 00:58:21,890
He'll eat when he wakes up!

816
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:24,292
I'm sorry, Al,
sleep is what he needs.

817
00:58:24,392 --> 00:58:26,161
Yes, sir.

818
00:58:28,531 --> 00:58:29,798
I just looked
in on him, Jennings.

819
00:58:29,898 --> 00:58:31,867
He's still asleep,
don't bother him.

820
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:34,236
Call it what you want,
sir, we could help him.

821
00:58:37,339 --> 00:58:41,076
Wouldn't you just postpone
what he's going through?

822
00:58:41,176 --> 00:58:42,811
Probably.

823
00:58:42,911 --> 00:58:46,014
Then let him alone, will you?

824
00:58:46,114 --> 00:58:48,751
You better take it
easy yourself, sir.

825
00:58:48,851 --> 00:58:50,886
Nothing wrong
with me, I'm fine.

826
00:58:54,957 --> 00:58:56,892
Well, what do you
want me to do?

827
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:59,595
Well, right now why don't
you go topside for a smoke?

828
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,731
Ah, maybe you're right.

829
00:59:04,032 --> 00:59:05,568
Okay.

830
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:07,169
But leave him alone, huh?

831
00:59:07,269 --> 00:59:09,104
Thanks.

832
00:59:10,773 --> 00:59:12,708
Why did she love you so much?

833
00:59:12,808 --> 00:59:15,744
I don't know, I guess
it was my personality.

834
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:18,246
What's the matter? The other
guy had more personality?

835
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:21,183
No, all he had was a car.

836
00:59:21,283 --> 00:59:24,052
So why didn't you get a car?
Yeah, why didn't you get a car?

837
00:59:24,152 --> 00:59:26,188
And drive around
all that traffic?

838
00:59:26,288 --> 00:59:27,590
( laughing )

839
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:29,191
Hey, I think he's right.

840
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:31,026
Hey, knock it off, you guys.

841
00:59:32,427 --> 00:59:34,396
How's the captain, sir?
He's coming along fine.

842
00:59:34,496 --> 00:59:36,164
Oh, that's good.
Good.

843
00:59:36,264 --> 00:59:41,470
Mr. Sloan, have you ever
had any trouble with dames?

844
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:43,972
Well, yeah.
Once in a while.

845
00:59:44,072 --> 00:59:45,941
( laughter )

846
00:59:58,721 --> 01:00:00,623
Good morning, gentlemen.

847
01:00:00,723 --> 01:00:01,724
Morning, sir.
Morning, sir.

848
01:00:01,824 --> 01:00:03,091
Good morning, sir.

849
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,599
Why don't you boys
get some coffee?

850
01:00:10,699 --> 01:00:11,900
I'll take over
the watch.

851
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:12,901
Yes, sir.

852
01:00:13,001 --> 01:00:14,036
Aye, sir.

853
01:00:16,338 --> 01:00:18,240
What's our position?

854
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:21,043
8 days,
16 hours and...

855
01:00:21,143 --> 01:00:23,746
10 minutes from the bar
of the Royal Hawaiian.

856
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,349
I was out that long?

857
01:00:27,449 --> 01:00:28,884
Why shouldn't
you sleep?

858
01:00:28,984 --> 01:00:29,718
Yeah.

859
01:00:29,818 --> 01:00:32,354
We're going home.

860
01:00:32,454 --> 01:00:34,289
What did you report?

861
01:00:34,389 --> 01:00:36,792
I told ComSubPac to have
the Royal Hawaiian

862
01:00:36,892 --> 01:00:38,360
put out
another bartender.

863
01:00:39,695 --> 01:00:41,096
What else did you
tell them?

864
01:00:42,698 --> 01:00:44,599
Nothing else.

865
01:00:45,701 --> 01:00:48,603
Arch,
you know that...

866
01:00:50,472 --> 01:00:52,007
sleep as you call it,

867
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:53,508
that could put me
behind a desk

868
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,544
for the rest
of the war.

869
01:00:55,644 --> 01:00:56,779
You know that,
don't you?

870
01:00:56,879 --> 01:00:58,681
Everybody sleeps.

871
01:00:58,781 --> 01:01:00,816
Who knows
how long you slept?

872
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:02,951
You do.

873
01:01:05,721 --> 01:01:08,857
If ComSubPac should ask you
anything, what would you tell them?

874
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:10,893
Why should they ask?
What would you tell them?

875
01:01:10,993 --> 01:01:16,264
If they ask, Barney,
I'd have to tell the truth.

876
01:01:21,203 --> 01:01:24,873
Arch, you are
the only man alive

877
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:27,743
who can keep me from
getting the Shinaru.

878
01:01:30,312 --> 01:01:32,347
Don't you think
I want it too, Barney?

879
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:36,151
Thanks.

880
01:01:40,255 --> 01:01:42,190
When he gets here,
let's really pour it on him.

881
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:43,558
Yeah.

882
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,661
( humming )
Here's your hat.

883
01:01:45,761 --> 01:01:47,329
You're looking
for me, Benson?

884
01:01:47,429 --> 01:01:49,131
You were the last one to look
at the slides yesterday?

885
01:01:49,231 --> 01:01:50,866
Yeah, and they
were the greatest...

886
01:01:50,966 --> 01:01:52,534
Look, don't try
to worm out of it.

887
01:01:52,634 --> 01:01:54,069
You know what you did?
You touched it.

888
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:56,171
Touched it?
And smudged it!

889
01:01:56,271 --> 01:01:59,207
Smudged it? Left your
big fat fingerprint all over it.

890
01:01:59,307 --> 01:02:00,909
Look at that!

891
01:02:02,477 --> 01:02:03,912
Where?

892
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:06,548
You know where.
You mean right by...

893
01:02:06,648 --> 01:02:08,784
No, down in
the right hand corner.

894
01:02:08,884 --> 01:02:10,452
Oh, yeah,
I think I see it.

895
01:02:10,552 --> 01:02:12,520
You think you see it?
Of course you see it!

896
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,356
First time I let some jughead
handle the slides,

897
01:02:14,456 --> 01:02:17,025
he ruins my business.
Metcalf, put this down.

898
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:19,995
Garrity, no slides
for 2 weeks!

899
01:02:20,095 --> 01:02:22,464
No slides
for 2 weeks?

900
01:02:22,564 --> 01:02:24,967
Hey, Benson, wait a minute,
I want to talk to you.

901
01:02:45,888 --> 01:02:47,155
Permission to
come aboard, sir.

902
01:02:47,255 --> 01:02:48,390
Certainly, sir.

903
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:49,892
Barney.
Admiral.

904
01:02:49,992 --> 01:02:51,159
Hello, Adams.
Hello, Barney, how are you?

905
01:02:51,259 --> 01:02:52,594
Nice to see you.

906
01:02:52,694 --> 01:02:54,429
Any further news, sir?

907
01:02:54,529 --> 01:02:56,999
Sorry, Barney,
no, not a word.

908
01:02:57,099 --> 01:02:59,434
No survivors were picked
up, huh? No report of it.

909
01:02:59,534 --> 01:03:01,636
They've put a blackout
over the whole thing.

910
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,105
You know
as much as we do.

911
01:03:03,205 --> 01:03:05,073
How soon
can I get back, sir?

912
01:03:05,173 --> 01:03:07,843
Barney, submarines work
better without holes in them.

913
01:03:07,943 --> 01:03:09,745
Well, these aren't
too bad, admiral,

914
01:03:09,845 --> 01:03:11,546
if I can have first
priority in dry dock.

915
01:03:11,646 --> 01:03:13,048
Well,
we'll do our best.

916
01:03:13,148 --> 01:03:15,550
Meanwhile, your orders
are take it easy.

917
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:16,985
We have rooms for you

918
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:18,420
at the Royal Hawaiian,
commander.

919
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,955
That's fine.
Thank you.

920
01:03:20,055 --> 01:03:21,456
Are you joining me
for luncheon, commander?

921
01:03:21,556 --> 01:03:22,791
Thank you, sir.

922
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:43,478
What's the matter?
Can't you sleep?

923
01:03:43,578 --> 01:03:45,047
Are you kidding?

924
01:03:45,147 --> 01:03:46,815
You're keeping me
awake.

925
01:03:52,554 --> 01:03:56,424
Look, Barney, you won't
sink the Shinaru in here.

926
01:03:58,026 --> 01:03:59,627
That admiral has given us
the run around.

927
01:03:59,727 --> 01:04:01,129
You know that,
don't you?

928
01:04:01,229 --> 01:04:03,966
He gave us first priority
in dry dock.

929
01:04:04,066 --> 01:04:05,567
That's right, that...

930
01:04:06,835 --> 01:04:08,236
That he did.

931
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:15,277
He didn't ask you
anything else, did he?

932
01:04:16,711 --> 01:04:17,746
Huh?

933
01:04:17,846 --> 01:04:20,215
For the last time,
no.

934
01:04:20,315 --> 01:04:21,817
Are you sure?

935
01:04:21,917 --> 01:04:23,986
Now will you get to bed
and get some rest?

936
01:04:26,288 --> 01:04:27,355
Okay.

937
01:04:29,024 --> 01:04:31,059
Okay, buddy,
okay.

938
01:04:40,002 --> 01:04:41,269
Lieutenant Sloan
reporting, sir.

939
01:04:41,369 --> 01:04:43,438
Good morning, Arch.
You sent for me?

940
01:04:43,538 --> 01:04:44,672
Sit down.

941
01:04:44,772 --> 01:04:46,508
Thank you, sir.

942
01:04:46,608 --> 01:04:48,743
Arch, what would be
the best possible news

943
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,678
I could give you?

944
01:04:50,778 --> 01:04:51,914
Sailing order, sir.

945
01:04:52,014 --> 01:04:53,348
Greyfish is ready.

946
01:04:53,448 --> 01:04:54,649
That is news.

947
01:04:54,749 --> 01:04:56,451
It'll do very nicely,
sir.

948
01:04:56,551 --> 01:04:58,253
How would you like
your own boat,

949
01:04:58,353 --> 01:05:00,388
Lieutenant
Commander Sloan?

950
01:05:02,057 --> 01:05:04,126
My own command?

951
01:05:04,226 --> 01:05:06,394
Your promotion
has just come through.

952
01:05:06,494 --> 01:05:09,764
That's a long haul from
apprentice seaman, Arch.

953
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,967
A brand new sub
waiting at New London

954
01:05:12,067 --> 01:05:13,768
for a top skipper.

955
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:15,870
The record says
that's you.

956
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:21,376
Funny, I...
I don't know what to say.

957
01:05:21,476 --> 01:05:24,046
Every skipper you've served
with has said it for you.

958
01:05:24,146 --> 01:05:26,248
Well, thank you, sir.

959
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:29,684
May I ask a question,
sir?

960
01:05:29,784 --> 01:05:31,419
All you like.

961
01:05:31,519 --> 01:05:33,956
Is Barney taking
the Greyfish out again?

962
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:38,126
Arch, that's a different
problem. Not to me, sir.

963
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:40,262
You've earned
the command, Arch.

964
01:05:40,362 --> 01:05:42,630
And Barney has earned another
crack at the Shinaru, sir.

965
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:45,300
He's overdue for a desk job
and a good rest.

966
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,603
He's still the best skipper
you've got, admiral.

967
01:05:48,703 --> 01:05:51,874
There's more than one factor
in duty assignments, Arch.

968
01:05:51,974 --> 01:05:54,509
You've got them all
for your own boat.

969
01:05:54,609 --> 01:05:57,946
I'd still have the same
as Barney's exec, sir.

970
01:05:58,046 --> 01:06:00,682
If you want to
remain his exec.

971
01:06:00,782 --> 01:06:02,050
I do, sir.

972
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:05,320
Arch, are you
covering for him?

973
01:06:07,522 --> 01:06:09,157
Covering what, sir?

974
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:13,228
Was he knocked out after
you came out of Tokyo Bay?

975
01:06:16,164 --> 01:06:17,832
3 days, sir.

976
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,767
But you know
what he'd been though.

977
01:06:19,867 --> 01:06:21,336
Of course I do.

978
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:23,906
But only you know
what came out of it.

979
01:06:24,006 --> 01:06:25,840
Well, he's passed
his new physical exam.

980
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,976
Perfect, the problem
is not physical.

981
01:06:28,076 --> 01:06:29,611
Is he fit, Arch?

982
01:06:30,979 --> 01:06:33,248
He's tense,
of course, but...

983
01:06:33,348 --> 01:06:34,883
I'd be worried
if he weren't.

984
01:06:34,983 --> 01:06:36,351
I think he's fit

985
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:38,286
and I want to sail
with him.

986
01:06:40,222 --> 01:06:42,457
The Shinaru
is still unreported.

987
01:06:42,557 --> 01:06:45,660
The best I could give him
would be a long shot hunch.

988
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,396
I'd like to try it,
sir.

989
01:06:48,496 --> 01:06:49,731
With Barney.

990
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:57,039
Thanks, Arch,
you've helped me.

991
01:06:57,139 --> 01:06:58,706
Thank you, sir.

992
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,342
But what about
Barney?

993
01:07:00,442 --> 01:07:02,911
You've helped him, too,
to one more trip.

994
01:07:03,011 --> 01:07:05,580
Get that Shinaru this time
or you'll have to kill her

995
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,781
with your own boat.

996
01:07:06,881 --> 01:07:08,150
Yes, sir.

997
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:13,888
Admiral,
you know Barney.

998
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,690
If he knew I'd been
offered my own command,

999
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:16,791
he'd make me
take it.

1000
01:07:16,891 --> 01:07:18,726
Yes, he would.

1001
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:22,730
All right, I won't tell him,
because after this trip,

1002
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:24,066
I'm making you take it.

1003
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:26,268
Yes, sir.

1004
01:08:30,198 --> 01:08:31,533
What's wrong?

1005
01:08:35,937 --> 01:08:38,173
Kiska...
approach patrol.

1006
01:08:38,273 --> 01:08:40,442
You know what that
means, don't you?

1007
01:08:40,542 --> 01:08:43,545
Well, they put us right,
right in the deep freeze.

1008
01:08:43,645 --> 01:08:45,280
Easy, Barney.

1009
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:47,482
After all he isn't running
the war just for one boat.

1010
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:49,017
You reading
his mind now?

1011
01:08:49,117 --> 01:08:51,419
Well, no,
I talked to him.

1012
01:08:55,657 --> 01:08:57,192
What?

1013
01:08:57,292 --> 01:09:00,662
Barney, the Shinaru
is unreported.

1014
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:04,066
He said he's giving us the best
long shot hunch he has,

1015
01:09:04,166 --> 01:09:06,568
and his hunches are based
on good intelligence.

1016
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:09,904
What else
did you talk about?

1017
01:09:10,004 --> 01:09:11,806
You.

1018
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:15,643
Go on.

1019
01:09:17,312 --> 01:09:18,913
He wanted to know how long
you'd been knocked out

1020
01:09:19,013 --> 01:09:20,415
after Tokyo Bay.

1021
01:09:21,216 --> 01:09:22,484
I told him.

1022
01:09:25,287 --> 01:09:27,922
What else did you
tell him, hmm?

1023
01:09:28,022 --> 01:09:31,359
I told him I wanted
to sail with you.

1024
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:34,262
You go shoot your mouth off
to the admiral

1025
01:09:34,362 --> 01:09:35,930
and next thing you know
we're headed for Kiska.

1026
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:37,499
Steady, boy.

1027
01:09:37,599 --> 01:09:39,033
You could have quit me,
you could have asked

1028
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:40,268
for a transfer,
why didn't you?

1029
01:09:40,368 --> 01:09:41,836
Yes, I could have
quit you!

1030
01:09:41,936 --> 01:09:43,605
Well, why didn't you?

1031
01:09:45,407 --> 01:09:47,675
Don't you
know that yet?

1032
01:09:50,312 --> 01:09:52,447
Just a minute,
Mr. Sloan.

1033
01:09:53,915 --> 01:09:55,950
Now you get this straight.

1034
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:57,885
I...

1035
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:00,688
I'm gonna get the Shinaru
in spite of what you think,

1036
01:10:00,788 --> 01:10:02,257
in spite of
what the admiral thinks,

1037
01:10:02,357 --> 01:10:04,226
in spite of
what anybody thinks.

1038
01:10:04,326 --> 01:10:05,993
Now you got that
straight?

1039
01:10:06,093 --> 01:10:07,229
Yes, sir.

1040
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:08,630
I got it.

1041
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:10,532
That's all.

1042
01:10:28,049 --> 01:10:29,317
Captain!

1043
01:10:29,417 --> 01:10:31,052
Captain!
Yes.

1044
01:10:31,152 --> 01:10:33,655
The Shinaru, she is
heading for Kiska Harbor.

1045
01:10:39,093 --> 01:10:40,495
Give me
the shortest course

1046
01:10:40,595 --> 01:10:41,863
between here
and Kiska Harbor.

1047
01:10:41,963 --> 01:10:43,197
Aye aye, sir.

1048
01:10:45,132 --> 01:10:47,969
Recommended base
course 085, Captain.

1049
01:10:48,069 --> 01:10:49,304
Come to course 085!

1050
01:10:49,404 --> 01:10:50,605
All ahead full.

1051
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:52,607
085, aye, sir.

1052
01:10:53,508 --> 01:10:55,177
All ahead full.

1053
01:10:55,277 --> 01:10:56,744
All ahead full,
sir.

1054
01:10:58,713 --> 01:11:00,582
Message to
Bluefin:

1055
01:11:00,682 --> 01:11:03,551
Follow us,
base course 085.

1056
01:11:03,651 --> 01:11:05,019
Aye, sir.

1057
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:06,788
Answer up,
all ahead full, sir.

1058
01:11:10,425 --> 01:11:13,761
Mr. Sloan,
come to the bridge.

1059
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:33,948
What does this mean?

1060
01:11:34,048 --> 01:11:36,551
About bringing you
back for your own boat?

1061
01:11:38,219 --> 01:11:39,687
What does
it sound like?

1062
01:11:44,125 --> 01:11:46,861
When did the admiral offer
you your own command?

1063
01:11:46,961 --> 01:11:49,664
Why should you care?

1064
01:11:52,667 --> 01:11:54,369
I wish you'd taken it,
Arch.

1065
01:11:54,469 --> 01:11:57,272
That makes two of us.

1066
01:11:57,372 --> 01:11:59,974
I want to follow in your
footsteps, Barney...

1067
01:12:01,643 --> 01:12:03,711
but one of us
has changed.

1068
01:12:21,095 --> 01:12:23,765
We're here, sir, part of
the entrance to Kiska Harbor.

1069
01:12:24,899 --> 01:12:26,167
Radar?

1070
01:12:26,267 --> 01:12:27,969
There's the headland, sir.

1071
01:12:28,069 --> 01:12:30,572
The Bluefin,
500 yards astern of us.

1072
01:12:31,873 --> 01:12:33,241
No more going
on the surface.

1073
01:12:33,341 --> 01:12:34,476
Clear the bridge.

1074
01:12:34,576 --> 01:12:35,843
TOGETHER:
Clear the bridge!

1075
01:12:37,879 --> 01:12:39,481
You men, go down
and get yourselves

1076
01:12:39,581 --> 01:12:41,549
some coffee
and get warm real fast.

1077
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:42,984
Foley?
Yes, sir.

1078
01:12:43,084 --> 01:12:44,386
Foley,
stand by the TDC.

1079
01:12:44,486 --> 01:12:45,753
Yes, sir.
How about the hatch?

1080
01:12:45,853 --> 01:12:47,589
Lock it down!
Lock it down!

1081
01:12:47,689 --> 01:12:50,258
We're attacking,
of course. We are.

1082
01:12:50,358 --> 01:12:52,360
I'd dive
the boat, sir.

1083
01:12:54,496 --> 01:12:56,531
I'm aware that
we have no visibility,

1084
01:12:56,631 --> 01:12:59,434
that's why I want my radar
to help my sonar.

1085
01:12:59,534 --> 01:13:01,536
Radar is already icing,

1086
01:13:01,636 --> 01:13:03,771
and this is
a tricky entrance, sir.

1087
01:13:11,713 --> 01:13:14,916
Left full rudder,
come to course 225.

1088
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,217
All ahead 2/3.

1089
01:13:16,317 --> 01:13:17,719
Left full rudder,
225.

1090
01:13:17,819 --> 01:13:20,388
All ahead 2/3,
aye, sir!

1091
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:30,632
Contact.
Broad contact.

1092
01:13:30,732 --> 01:13:33,535
This is all across
both bars. Radar?

1093
01:13:33,635 --> 01:13:35,036
No contact
to head, sir.

1094
01:13:35,136 --> 01:13:36,538
My antenna
must be iced.

1095
01:13:36,638 --> 01:13:38,229
All I'm getting
is a faint headland.

1096
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,542
Got it now!

1097
01:13:40,642 --> 01:13:42,310
Look at
all those blips.

1098
01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:43,711
Half the Jap navy
must be in there.

1099
01:13:43,811 --> 01:13:46,381
I count nine ships,
sir.

1100
01:13:46,481 --> 01:13:47,915
Range?
3,000 yards.

1101
01:13:48,015 --> 01:13:49,717
That big blip
must be the flattop.

1102
01:13:49,817 --> 01:13:51,919
It's not the same
contact, sir.

1103
01:13:52,019 --> 01:13:54,822
No, sir, mine's a broad
contact 200 yards ahead.

1104
01:13:57,859 --> 01:13:59,527
It could be the log
and chain boom

1105
01:13:59,627 --> 01:14:01,095
imported by intelligence,
captain.

1106
01:14:01,195 --> 01:14:02,964
How close?
Coming fast, sir.

1107
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:04,699
We'll stay for
one more confirmation.

1108
01:14:04,799 --> 01:14:06,434
It's a bad risk,
captain.

1109
01:14:31,759 --> 01:14:34,362
It's parked at 1,200 yards, just
coming around the headland tip.

1110
01:14:34,462 --> 01:14:35,597
She's attacking, sir.

1111
01:14:35,697 --> 01:14:37,465
( explosions )

1112
01:14:44,606 --> 01:14:46,073
Hard boom
dead ahead, sir.

1113
01:14:46,173 --> 01:14:47,074
Dive!
Yes, sir.

1114
01:14:47,174 --> 01:14:48,476
Dive the boat.

1115
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:51,813
( explosions )

1116
01:15:11,666 --> 01:15:14,902
( alarm blaring )

1117
01:15:26,648 --> 01:15:29,183
Come on!
Come on right away!

1118
01:15:29,283 --> 01:15:31,919
( alarm blaring
continuously )

1119
01:15:50,104 --> 01:15:52,874
Mr. Buckeye reports pressure
building up in the boat, sir.

1120
01:15:52,974 --> 01:15:55,543
How much pressure?
How much pressure?

1121
01:15:55,643 --> 01:15:58,513
Eight pounds, sir. We got a
ruptured air line but we can handle it!

1122
01:15:58,613 --> 01:16:00,147
How much depth
do we have here?

1123
01:16:00,247 --> 01:16:01,849
30 fathoms, sir.

1124
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:04,452
Take us down to 90 feet.

1125
01:16:04,552 --> 01:16:06,187
Take it down
to 90 feet.

1126
01:16:06,287 --> 01:16:07,489
90 feet!

1127
01:16:07,589 --> 01:16:09,223
We've lost
both scopes, sir.

1128
01:16:09,323 --> 01:16:10,692
Radar inoperative, sir.

1129
01:16:10,792 --> 01:16:12,383
Antenna must have
been carried away.

1130
01:16:15,997 --> 01:16:18,399
Steady as you go.
Steady as you go, sir.

1131
01:16:18,499 --> 01:16:19,834
All compartments
report in.

1132
01:16:19,934 --> 01:16:21,302
What's the matter,
Barney?

1133
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:24,839
Pharmacist, right to the
conning tower on the double.

1134
01:16:24,939 --> 01:16:27,174
Pharmacist right on
the double, aye, sir!

1135
01:16:29,811 --> 01:16:31,846
Come sit over by
the chart table, Barney.

1136
01:16:34,716 --> 01:16:36,518
Bluefin is calling
in for a check, sir.

1137
01:16:36,618 --> 01:16:38,085
Tell them we're
proceeding with the attack.

1138
01:16:38,185 --> 01:16:39,353
Aye, sir.

1139
01:16:39,453 --> 01:16:40,888
90 feet
and holding, sir!

1140
01:16:42,189 --> 01:16:43,326
Get his arm on the table.

1141
01:16:44,726 --> 01:16:45,960
Take a look at this.

1142
01:16:50,364 --> 01:16:52,099
How is it?

1143
01:16:52,199 --> 01:16:54,368
It's broken above
the elbow, captain.

1144
01:16:54,468 --> 01:16:56,303
I can handle it.

1145
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:57,639
Go ahead then.

1146
01:17:10,384 --> 01:17:11,686
Benson?
Aye, sir.

1147
01:17:11,786 --> 01:17:13,120
Give Mr. Fisher
the first bearing

1148
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:14,388
you had on that flattop.

1149
01:17:14,488 --> 01:17:16,123
295, sir.

1150
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:24,465
What's that for?

1151
01:17:24,565 --> 01:17:25,900
Morphine, sir.

1152
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,735
The shot would
help you, sir.

1153
01:17:27,835 --> 01:17:29,370
It wouldn't
help my shooting.

1154
01:17:31,538 --> 01:17:33,575
Are you making
a sound attack?

1155
01:17:33,675 --> 01:17:35,109
That's right.

1156
01:17:35,209 --> 01:17:37,444
You know the chances of
getting a hit

1157
01:17:37,544 --> 01:17:39,413
with sound
are about 1 in 8?

1158
01:17:39,513 --> 01:17:42,349
Not very good odds,
are they?

1159
01:17:44,018 --> 01:17:46,020
You want to quit?
Uh-uh.

1160
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:49,991
Just checking your plans,
in case you pass out.

1161
01:17:50,091 --> 01:17:52,994
I'm getting some
strange sounds, captain.

1162
01:18:11,813 --> 01:18:13,314
What do you make of it?

1163
01:18:15,817 --> 01:18:17,084
I don't know.

1164
01:18:17,184 --> 01:18:19,086
Pretty faint yet.

1165
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:21,889
Bearing?

1166
01:18:25,292 --> 01:18:26,794
295.

1167
01:18:26,894 --> 01:18:30,064
Come to course 295.

1168
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:31,899
All ahead 1/3.

1169
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:38,439
That's an anchor chain.

1170
01:18:38,539 --> 01:18:40,041
Of course it is.

1171
01:18:41,843 --> 01:18:43,244
Shinaru.

1172
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:46,848
Sure, she's
getting underway.

1173
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:49,516
She's trying
to bail out of there

1174
01:18:49,616 --> 01:18:51,252
before she gets caught.

1175
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:53,420
At 295 and holding.

1176
01:18:54,555 --> 01:18:55,823
Very well.

1177
01:18:55,923 --> 01:18:57,258
Target
still stationary, sir.

1178
01:18:57,358 --> 01:18:58,793
1,800 yards.

1179
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:03,831
Battle stations torpedo,
make ready all bow tubes.

1180
01:19:04,631 --> 01:19:05,867
Can you shoot?

1181
01:19:06,734 --> 01:19:08,002
I can.

1182
01:19:09,303 --> 01:19:10,471
Take the sound.

1183
01:19:22,984 --> 01:19:25,019
Destroyer coming up fast.

1184
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:27,154
Right in
the groove again.

1185
01:19:27,254 --> 01:19:29,691
Dive and lose the shot
or stay here

1186
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:31,192
and take the beating.

1187
01:19:32,493 --> 01:19:34,061
Maybe lose the boat.

1188
01:19:37,664 --> 01:19:39,366
What would you do,
Mr. Sloan?

1189
01:19:41,202 --> 01:19:42,837
Your choice.

1190
01:19:42,937 --> 01:19:45,539
I came here to learn,
remember?

1191
01:19:45,639 --> 01:19:48,609
That's why I'm asking you.

1192
01:19:48,709 --> 01:19:50,311
What would you do?

1193
01:19:53,314 --> 01:19:54,949
I'd stay up and shoot.

1194
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:57,384
That's what we're here for.

1195
01:19:57,484 --> 01:20:00,021
Group's ready, sir.

1196
01:20:00,121 --> 01:20:01,989
We'll fire 6 at 1,000.

1197
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:04,558
We can fire
anytime now, sir.

1198
01:20:04,658 --> 01:20:06,894
Every second
improves the shot.

1199
01:20:08,963 --> 01:20:10,497
You can't, Arch.

1200
01:20:27,381 --> 01:20:28,916
She's yours, skipper.

1201
01:20:31,585 --> 01:20:33,120
Ours.

1202
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:37,291
You do it.

1203
01:20:40,962 --> 01:20:42,663
Go ahead and shoot, Arch.

1204
01:20:42,763 --> 01:20:44,498
Go ahead.

1205
01:20:59,513 --> 01:21:00,882
All away,
captain.

1206
01:21:02,449 --> 01:21:04,151
Running through
the target so far?

1207
01:21:04,251 --> 01:21:05,486
I hope.

1208
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:09,123
What if I missed?

1209
01:21:10,591 --> 01:21:12,026
That'll be two of us.

1210
01:21:13,427 --> 01:21:15,196
We aren't gonna miss
the shellacking.

1211
01:21:15,296 --> 01:21:17,031
They're unloading
the rack on us.

1212
01:21:49,630 --> 01:21:50,865
How long to target, Foley?

1213
01:21:50,965 --> 01:21:52,433
6 seconds to go, sir.

1214
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:26,000
( screaming )

1215
01:22:26,833 --> 01:22:29,070
( explosions )

1216
01:22:44,986 --> 01:22:48,222
( indistinct chatter )

1217
01:22:50,457 --> 01:22:51,758
Move it!
Move it!

1218
01:22:51,858 --> 01:22:54,495
( indistinct chatter )

1219
01:23:06,673 --> 01:23:07,574
All right!
Get up!

1220
01:23:07,674 --> 01:23:08,709
Hurry! Up!

1221
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,322
Can't close it, Barney!

1222
01:23:55,422 --> 01:23:56,657
Put 50 pounds of
pressure in there!

1223
01:23:56,757 --> 01:23:58,559
Aye, sir!

1224
01:24:03,797 --> 01:24:05,332
Benson?

1225
01:24:15,242 --> 01:24:16,743
Forward battery rooms
are all right,

1226
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:17,911
we still got lights.

1227
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:19,580
Now, Goldy?
Sir.

1228
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:22,216
SOS Bluefin to stand by,
we're abandoning ship.

1229
01:24:28,955 --> 01:24:30,124
I can't get anything,
sir.

1230
01:24:30,224 --> 01:24:31,392
( explosion )

1231
01:24:31,492 --> 01:24:32,859
All, I can...

1232
01:24:32,959 --> 01:24:34,161
Wait!

1233
01:24:34,261 --> 01:24:36,063
Listen, torpedoes!

1234
01:24:51,145 --> 01:24:53,547
She's fired
at that destroyer, sir!

1235
01:25:04,258 --> 01:25:06,427
Keep calling the Bluefin.
Keep calling!

1236
01:25:06,527 --> 01:25:08,195
What's the count,
Mr. Buckeye?

1237
01:25:08,295 --> 01:25:09,596
Twenty here, sir,
and the lot should be

1238
01:25:09,696 --> 01:25:11,598
safe in the forward
torpedo room.

1239
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:14,268
Keep calling.

1240
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,602
I'm broadcasting, sir.

1241
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:35,856
Captain, I have an
SOS from Greyfish.

1242
01:25:35,956 --> 01:25:36,990
Where are they?

1243
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:39,360
Right here, sir.

1244
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:40,661
We must be
directly over them.

1245
01:25:40,761 --> 01:25:41,962
All stop!

1246
01:25:42,062 --> 01:25:43,497
Now we can call.

1247
01:25:43,597 --> 01:25:44,731
Aye aye, sir.

1248
01:25:44,831 --> 01:25:46,100
I got them.

1249
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,634
I got them, captain,
I got them!

1250
01:25:47,734 --> 01:25:49,470
Tell them to stand by.
We'll start escape.

1251
01:25:49,570 --> 01:25:51,138
Break out the
battle lanterns.

1252
01:25:51,238 --> 01:25:52,539
( coughing )

1253
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:54,941
Fisher, break out
the Momsen lungs.

1254
01:25:55,041 --> 01:25:56,510
Aye, sir.

1255
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:58,779
Foley, Benson,
break out the ascending line,

1256
01:25:58,879 --> 01:25:59,980
we're going up.

1257
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,515
Aye, sir.
Aye, sir.

1258
01:26:02,883 --> 01:26:04,518
Captain!
Captain!

1259
01:26:06,052 --> 01:26:07,454
It's the Bluefin, sir.

1260
01:26:19,099 --> 01:26:20,467
Now let's go.

1261
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:22,836
Now let's move.

1262
01:26:22,936 --> 01:26:24,271
Aye!
Come on!

1263
01:26:26,307 --> 01:26:28,709
Arch. See if you can
get the torpedo room.

1264
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:30,277
Aye, sir.

1265
01:26:30,377 --> 01:26:32,679
Fisher, charge the
Momsens with oxygen.

1266
01:26:32,779 --> 01:26:33,747
Aye aye, sir.

1267
01:26:33,847 --> 01:26:34,915
Let's move in.

1268
01:26:39,019 --> 01:26:40,254
They have access, sir.

1269
01:26:40,354 --> 01:26:41,888
Tell them to escape.
Aye, sir.

1270
01:26:51,632 --> 01:26:54,067
Ever felt anything
this cold?

1271
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:55,236
Lord, yes!

1272
01:26:55,336 --> 01:26:56,837
Brighton in August.

1273
01:27:02,209 --> 01:27:03,477
Open the front valve.

1274
01:27:22,796 --> 01:27:23,930
That's it.

1275
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:25,332
That's it, sir.

1276
01:27:25,432 --> 01:27:26,667
All right,
now listen to me.

1277
01:27:28,502 --> 01:27:30,971
Go up steady
and take it easy.

1278
01:27:32,172 --> 01:27:33,340
Breathe in and out
real slow

1279
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,075
so you don't
hurt your lungs.

1280
01:27:35,175 --> 01:27:36,277
You hear me back there?

1281
01:27:36,377 --> 01:27:37,811
Yes, sir.
Aye, sir.

1282
01:27:37,911 --> 01:27:39,112
Everybody set?

1283
01:27:39,212 --> 01:27:40,747
Yes, sir.
Aye, sir.

1284
01:27:41,982 --> 01:27:43,049
Come on, let's go.

1285
01:27:43,149 --> 01:27:44,818
This is a standard drill.

1286
01:27:44,918 --> 01:27:47,788
And I want to see every one
of your ugly faces up there.

1287
01:27:48,789 --> 01:27:50,123
Waiting for us.

1288
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:52,459
Part the hatch.

1289
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:30,591
( alarm blaring )

1290
01:29:58,952 --> 01:30:00,554
Hurry it up!

1291
01:30:00,654 --> 01:30:02,122
The fog is lifting!

1292
01:30:03,557 --> 01:30:05,792
( siren wailing )

1293
01:31:14,027 --> 01:31:15,796
( indistinct chatter )

1294
01:31:21,101 --> 01:31:22,168
Coffee, captain?

1295
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:39,586
Coffee
to the conning tower.

1296
01:31:39,686 --> 01:31:41,021
Coffee to the conning tower.

1297
01:31:41,121 --> 01:31:42,389
Steady on 025, sir.

1298
01:31:42,489 --> 01:31:43,490
Very well.

1299
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:45,459
Thanks, Benny.

1300
01:31:45,559 --> 01:31:46,893
Thanks a lot.

1301
01:31:48,261 --> 01:31:49,229
Here you are, Barney.

1302
01:31:49,329 --> 01:31:50,797
Thanks a lot.

1303
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,002
How about the men?

1304
01:31:56,102 --> 01:31:57,604
Chief Hallert says
six men unreported

1305
01:31:57,704 --> 01:31:59,540
from the aft
torpedo room.

1306
01:32:01,074 --> 01:32:02,543
Who are they?

1307
01:32:03,977 --> 01:32:06,747
Philips, Owens,
and Hughes,

1308
01:32:06,847 --> 01:32:08,449
Abrahams, Sherman,
and Howard.

1309
01:32:08,549 --> 01:32:10,451
Look, Barney,
two of you better get below,

1310
01:32:10,551 --> 01:32:12,118
get some rest.
He's right, Barney.

1311
01:32:12,218 --> 01:32:13,520
Let's go down
and get that arm fixed.

1312
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:15,622
No, no, wait a minute.

1313
01:32:15,722 --> 01:32:17,257
Did you get
any confirmation?

1314
01:32:17,357 --> 01:32:18,659
From the Shinaru?

1315
01:32:18,759 --> 01:32:20,026
We couldn't see
anything up there.

1316
01:32:20,126 --> 01:32:21,161
Solid fog.

1317
01:32:23,096 --> 01:32:25,966
Well, look again
for me, will you?

1318
01:32:26,066 --> 01:32:27,834
Please.

1319
01:32:27,934 --> 01:32:29,603
All right.

1320
01:32:35,175 --> 01:32:37,277
We heard a couple
of hits we thought,

1321
01:32:37,377 --> 01:32:39,741
but we didn't know with that
beating you were taking.

1322
01:32:41,147 --> 01:32:42,683
Barney.

1323
01:32:42,783 --> 01:32:44,184
Barney, look at that.

1324
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:09,142
Pass the word to the rest
of my crew, will you?

1325
01:33:09,242 --> 01:33:10,243
Pipe this through the ship.

1326
01:33:10,343 --> 01:33:11,578
Aye, sir.

1327
01:33:13,113 --> 01:33:14,915
Captain to the crew
of the Greyfish.

1328
01:33:15,015 --> 01:33:17,851
Here's a periscope
observation.

1329
01:33:17,951 --> 01:33:24,090
Bearing 285,
range 4,000 yards.

1330
01:33:25,525 --> 01:33:28,061
The flattop
Shinaru is sinking.

1331
01:33:29,630 --> 01:33:33,133
She is listing about
30 degrees to the port.

1332
01:33:33,233 --> 01:33:38,271
And she is going down
by the bow very fast.

1333
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:41,808
She's down by the bow now.

1334
01:33:41,908 --> 01:33:44,577
Gears rolling
off of her decks.

1335
01:33:46,412 --> 01:33:48,615
She's slipping, fast.

1336
01:33:59,826 --> 01:34:01,294
There she goes.

1337
01:34:28,288 --> 01:34:30,657
Scratch one flattop.

1338
01:34:32,592 --> 01:34:33,760
It's confirmed sinking.

1339
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:35,762
Well done, Greyfish.

1340
01:34:37,097 --> 01:34:38,765
Down scope.

1341
01:34:38,865 --> 01:34:40,300
All ahead full,
let's get out of here.

1342
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:41,902
All ahead full, sir.
