- But she hit him--
- Don't bother us now, honey.

11

But Miss Gulch hit Toto with a rake...

14

her nasty old cat every day!

--Seventy. Dorothy, please!

Just once or twice a week.

Miss Gulch? Just because Toto--

27
00:03:22,707 --> 00:03:25,209
Listen, honey,
I got them hogs to get in.

28
00:03:25,376 --> 00:03:29,505

You'd think you didn't have any brains.

Don't go by Miss Gulch's place.

walk up to her and spit in her eye.

...seats of great learning,
where men go to become great thinkers.

They think deep thoughts,

That's Doctor of Thinkology.

As for you, my fine friend, you're
a victim of disorganized thinking.

You're confusing courage with wisdom.

than you have.

that you haven't got. A medal.

01:39:40,896 --> 01:39:44,399
Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.

1189
01:39:44,566 --> 01:39:46,651
Oh, Auntie Em, it's you!

1190
01:39:46,818 --> 01:39:49,821
- Yes, darling.
PROFESSOR: Hello there! Anybody home?

1191
01:39:49,988 --> 01:39:53,658
I dropped by because I heard
the little girl got caught in the big--

1192
01:39:53,825 --> 01:39:57,621
- Well, she seems all right now.
- She got quite a bump on the head.

1193
01:39:57,787 --> 01:40:00,332
We kind of thought
she was gonna leave us.

1194
01:40:00,499 --> 01:40:03,210
But I did leave you.
That's just the trouble.

1195
01:40:03,376 --> 01:40:05,378
And I tried to get back for days!

1196
01:40:05,545 --> 01:40:07,506
There, there, lie quiet now.

1197
01:40:07,672 --> 01:40:10,759
- You just had a bad dream.
- Sure.

1198
01:40:10,926 --> 01:40:12,511
Remember me...

1199
01:40:12,677 --> 01:40:14,930
...your old pal, Hunk?

1200
01:40:15,096 --> 01:40:17,724
And me, Hickory?

1201
01:40:17,891 --> 01:40:19,726
You couldn't forget my face,
could you?

1202
01:40:19,893 --> 01:40:23,647
No. But it wasn't a dream.
It was a place.

1203
01:40:23,813 --> 01:40:26,483
And you and you and you...

1204
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:28,568
...and you were there.

1205
01:40:29,819 --> 01:40:31,696
But you couldn't have been,
could you?

1206
01:40:31,863 --> 01:40:33,865
AUNTIE EM: We dream lots
of silly things when we--

1207
01:40:34,032 --> 01:40:38,036
No, Aunt Em, this was
a real, truly live place.

1208
01:40:38,203 --> 01:40:41,289
And I remember that some of it
wasn't very nice...

1209
01:40:41,456 --> 01:40:43,416
...but most of it was beautiful.

1210
01:40:43,583 --> 01:40:47,462
But just the same, all I kept saying
to everybody was, "I want to go home!"

1211
01:40:47,629 --> 01:40:49,714
And they sent me home.

Doesn't anybody believe me?

1214
01:40:53,552 --> 01:40:55,637
Of course we believe you, Dorothy.

1215
01:40:55,804 --> 01:40:58,306
But anyway, Toto, we're home!

1216
01:40:58,473 --> 01:41:01,309
Home! And this is my room...

1217
01:41:01,476 --> 01:41:03,061
...and you're all here.

1218
01:41:03,228 --> 01:41:06,439
And I'm not going to leave here
ever, ever again...

1219
01:41:06,606 --> 01:41:08,567
...because I love you all.

1220
01:41:08,733 --> 01:41:12,195
And oh, Auntie Em...

1221
01:41:12,362 --> 01:41:15,407
...there's no place like home!
