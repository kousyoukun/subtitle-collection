1
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,480
人类经历了10万年
It took the earth's population a hundred thousand years

2
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,490
才繁衍出10亿人口
to reach a billion people.

3
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,640
在随后的100年 人口增长到20亿
And then just, a hundred more to reach 2 billion.

4
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,900
再翻一番 只花了50年
And only 50 years to double again...

5
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,700
在70年代 人口增至40亿
double again to four billion in 1970.

6
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,620
现在 我们快要达到80亿了 80亿
We're nearly at 8 billion now. ... 8 billion now.

7
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,850
我们正通过延长人均寿命的方式自我毁灭
We are destroying the very means by which life is extended.

8
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,760
每一次全球性的瘟疫灾难都可以被归咎
Every single global ill that plagues the Earth can be traced back...

9
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,530
被归咎于人口的过剩 人口过剩
traced back to human overpopulation... human overpopulation.

10
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,240
为什么我们还不付诸行动
What didn't we demand any action?

11
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,140
我们大量砍伐 倾倒垃圾 挥霍消费 肆意破坏
we clear cut, we dump, we consume, we destroy.

12
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,220
地球上半数的动物物种业已消亡
Half the animal species on earth have vanished

13
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,550
在过去40年里被灭绝 40年
vanished for the last 40 years... 40 years.

14
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,060
我们仍在侵略自然环境
and still we keep attacking our own environment!

15
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,270
非到大难临头 才得深刻教训 ... 留心关注
it doesn't take a catastrophe to learn our lesson... to get our attention

16
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,750
唯有痛苦方可改变行为
Nothing changes behaviour like pain.

17
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,490
或许只有痛苦 才能拯救我们
Maybe pain can save us.

18
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,670
有一个开关
There is a switch,

19
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,120
若你打开
if you throw it,

20
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,910
地球上半数人口会死亡
half the people on earth will die.

21
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:19,880
但反之 人类将在一百年内灭绝
But if you don't, the human race will be extinct in a hundred years.

22
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,500
你会怎么做
What would you do?

23
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,100
人类就像人体内的癌症
Mankind is the cancer in its own body.

24
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,600
你有拯救芸芸众生的切肤博爱吗
Do you love humanity enough to save it?

25
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,600
为防万一 他们捉住我
In case, they find me,

26
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,800
我给你留下了一串指引
I left you a path.

27
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,420
但它是最艰险的征程
The hardest one yet.

28
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,580
坎坷尽头 横亘炼狱
Inferno will be at the end

29
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,190
你是我的应急计划
You are my contingency plan.

30
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,680
你是人类最后的希望
You are humanity's final hope.

31
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,830
请确保地狱的降临
Make sure Inferno is unleashed.

32
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,100
寻找 就寻见 (圣经 马太福音 第7章 第7节)
Seek and find

33
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,450
佛罗伦萨巴迪亚教堂, 佛罗伦萨, 意大利
Badia Fiorentina (Church), Florence, Italy

34
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,360
追了一路
A long road.

35
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,540
却跑来这里
but here we are.

36
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,440
相比美国人 我更棒些
Better me, than the Americans.

37
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,590
接下来你要向我坦白 它在哪里
You're going to want to tell me where it is.

38
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,070
没错 布沙尔先生
Yes, Mr. Bouchard.

39
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,180
我知道我会的
I know I will.

40
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,260
告诉他们
Tell them,

41
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,500
人类是灾 地狱为解
"Humanity is the disease, Inferno is the cure."

42
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,800
叛徒
Traitor!

43
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,460
受难吧 罪人们 为汝之孽付出代价
Suffer, you sinners. Pay for your sins.

44
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,800
受难吧 罪人们 为汝之孽付出代价
Suffer, you sinners. Pay for your sins.

45
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,720
为汝之孽付出代价
Pay for your sins.

46
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,500
受难吧 罪人们 为汝之孽付出代价
Suffer, you sinners. Pay for your sins.

47
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,500
丢魂失魄
Ruin of souls...

48
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,220
- 请稍等 - 怎么回事 ...
- One moment, please - What is going ...

49
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,020
- 发生了什么 - 布鲁克斯医生
- What is happening - Dr. Brooks

50
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,200
抛弃所有的希望
Abadon all hope

51
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,200
所有希望
All hope ...

52
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,650
兰登先生 我是布鲁克斯医生
Mr. Langdon, I'm Dr. Brooks.

53
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,150
我会做些检查 不必担心
I'm going to do a few checks, nothing to worry about.

54
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,960
咱们把它扔掉 好吗
Let's get rid of this, shall we?

55
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,900
您知道今天是周几吗
Do you know what day of the week it is?

56
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,250
周六
Saturday.

57
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,160

58
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,810
周一 6月28号
Monday, 28th of June.

59
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,780
您知道我们在哪儿吗
Do you know where we are?

60
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,350
波士顿
Boston.

61
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,100
麻省总医院
Massachusetts General (Hospital)

62
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,200
您最后能记起的事情是什么
And what's the last thing you can remember?

63
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,840
我 呃 我在校园里
I uh... I was on campus.

64
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,170
一切都好模糊 我看不清楚
Everything is blur. It's out of focus.

65
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,520
我是不是遇到了什么意外
Was I in some kind of an accident?

66
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,570
我们会弄清楚的
We'll get to that.

67
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,380
您有没有人需要帮忙通知的
Is there someone we should call for you?

68
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,570
没
No.

69
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,220
您的妻子 家人
Your Wife? Family?

70
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,320
不 不 我没结婚
No. No. I'm not married.

71
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,530
兰登教授 你的头部受创
Professor Langdon, you're suffering from a head trauma.

72
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,530
您似乎有轻微的逆行性失忆
You appeared to have a mild retrograde amnesia

73
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,800
我们做了个CT扫瞄 没有发现颅内出血
We've done a CT scan, there's no evidence of intracranial bleeding.

74
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,570
一切都挺好 会恢复的
Which is very reassuring. Non-terminal.

75
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,840
试着放松下来
Just try to relax.

76
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,240
神经系统方面 看样子没问题
Neurologically, you seem to be fine.

77
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,920
您的记忆会在随后几天恢复
Your memory will return over the next several days.

78
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,050
那么我们 ... 我们就安心静养吧
So we'll... we'll wait and watch.

79
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,880
能麻烦你关下灯吗
Could you turn off the lights please.

80
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,640
没问题
Of course.

81
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,490
若是头部创伤严重 导致脑挫裂伤 那...
If the head trauma was bad enough to cause a cerebral contusion, then...

82
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,570
麻烦你 ... 麻烦你关下灯好吗
Could you please ... Could you please turn off the lights?

83
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:36,250
我在 ... 佛罗伦萨 ... 来干什么
What am I... doing... in Florence?

84
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,760
那是个大教堂 是佛罗伦萨旧宫 对吗
That's a Duomo. That's the Palazzo Vecchio, isn't it?

85
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,000
对的
Yes.

86
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,560
怎么 ... 我怎么来这儿的
How... How did I get here?

87
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,350
3小时前 你头部带伤 跑来我们的急诊室
You came to our emergency room 3 hours ago with a head wound.

88
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,850
我 ... 我是不是还有位女伴
Was I... Was I with a woman?

89
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,140
没 一位出租车司机送您来的
No, a cab driver brought you in.

90
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,420
没拿钱包 没有手机 没带身份证
No wallet. No phone. No ID.

91
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,230
你怎么知道我名字
How do you know my name?

92
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,210
咱俩见过
We've met.

93
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,440
我在伦敦帝国学院听过你的演讲 后面还聊了下
I saw you lecture at the Church in Imperial College London, we spoke afterwards,

94
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,290
您待我很亲切
you were very nice to me.

95
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,850
我们见过
We've met.

96
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,500
抱歉 那样讲不大恰当
Sorry, that's not quite fair.

97
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,260
那时候我9岁
I was nine at that time.

98
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,810
慢着 9 9岁
Wait. Nine-nine years old?

99
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,950
我那时对拼图游戏很入迷
I was crazy about puzzles.

100
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,170
我也喜欢您的书
And I like your books.

101
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:37,090
也许不是"失落的表意文字语言" 而是其他的
Maybe not "Lost language of Ideograms", but the others.

102
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,650
好吧
Okay.

103
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,460
我全看了
I read them all.

104
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,000
古怪的小年轻
A weird kid.

105
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,330
的确如此
I was actually.

106
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,160
我刚刚讲得很大声吗
Did I say that out loud?

107
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,730
是的
You did.

108
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,500
非常抱歉
Very sorry.

109
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,720
兰登教授 您的头疼症状一开始会比较强烈
Professor Langdon, your headaches are going to be intense initially.

110
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,690
您也可能还会有恶心 糊涂 头昏等情况
And you can also expect nausea, confusion and dizziness.

111
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,440
前台来的电话
That was the front desk.

112
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,210
警察来了 要见您
The police are here to see you.

113
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,860
我 为什么
Me, why?

114
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,380
在与他们交流之前 兰登教授 您应该了解一下您的真实情况
Before you talk to them, Professor Langdon, you should know the facts of your case.

115
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,160
您头部的创伤并非事故所致
Your head wound was not caused by an accident.

116
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,180
而是枪击造成的
It was the result of a gunshot.

117
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,140
一枚子弹擦过您头骨顶端 您很可能还狠狠地摔了下来
A bullet grazed the top of your skull and you most likely took a bad fall

118
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,830
这是导致脑震荡的原因
which is what caused the concussion.

119
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,440
如果子弹再往里一英吋
If the bullet had been an inch to the side,

120
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,130
它就真的要命了
it could have killed you.

121
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,500
快点 快点儿
Come on, Come on

122
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,110
这边 这边 快
This way. This way, come on.

123
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,440
出租车
Taxi.

124
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,870
进来
Get in.

125
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,500
啥 你们喝醉了吗
What, are you drunk?

126
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,000
怎么回事
What happened?

127
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,700
快走
Let's go!

128
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,500
加速 开快点
Step on it. Floor it!

129
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,900
- 出了啥事 - 我不知道
- What's going on? - I don't know

130
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,040
接下来会比较疼
This is gonna hurt.

131
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,970
没关系
It's okay. It's okay.

132
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,900
罗伯特
Robert.

133
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,610
寻找 就寻见
Seek and find.

134
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,900
寻找 就必寻见
佛罗伦萨 意大利 凌晨 4:52
Seek and find.
Florence, Italy 4:52 AM

135
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,790
这儿是我的住处
This is my apartment.

136
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
你仍在佛罗伦萨
You're still in Florence.

137
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,250
我要打电话叫警察
I'm going to call the police.

138
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,140
等会 那个女警刚刚才试着杀掉咱们
Wait. That policewoman just tried to kill us.

139
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,150
好的
Okay.

140
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,470
那我们打给美国领事馆 如果你没意见的话
We will call the U.S. Consulate instead if you like.

141
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:11,440
先慢着 让我 ... 让我歇会
Just... wait. Just give me... give me a minute.

142
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,900
- 整理下情况 - 为什么会有人射杀你
- Get a hold on things - Why was someone shooting at you?

143
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,240
我不知道
I don't know.

144
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,500
还有 你进急诊室时
Also, when you came into ER,

145
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,790
你在反覆喃喃些什么
you were mumbling something over and over.

146
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,240
非常抱 ... 非常抱歉

147

非常抱歉

148
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,490
你知道你当时为什么要讲这些吗
Do you have any idea why you would be saying this?

149
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,110
- 不知道 - 为什么有人要射杀你
- No. - Why was someone shooting at you?

150
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,600
你可以继续对我追问这些 女士
You can keep asking me these questions, lady.

151
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,500
但我也不知道答案是什么

152

你刚刚问了很多问题

157
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,620
没错 我感觉我现在非常玻璃心
Yeah, I'm feeling a tad vulnerable right now.

158
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,710
我现在身旁待着一个正被追杀的人
I'm with someone other people want to shoot at!

159
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,540
对不起

160
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,410
这些问题很重要
Questions are important.

161
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,320
我希望你能记起来
And I hope you recover.

162
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,840
我可以再要 ... 一杯

163
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,030
那啥 棕色的 热的
What? It's brown and it's... hot.

164
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,720
人们早上喝来补充能量的 呃
People drink it in the morning for energy. Uh...

165
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,390

166
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,330
茶 不 另一种
Tea. No. The other one.

167
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,240
- 咖啡 - 咖啡
- Coffee. - Coffee.

168
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,770
我能要一杯咖啡吗
Could I have a cup of coffee?

169
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,180
当然
Sure.

170
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,050
谢谢
Thank you.

171
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,040

174

非常勇敢
That was very courageous.

175
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,190
本能反应罢了
It's just reflexes.

176
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,600
"非常抱歉"
"Very sorry".

177
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,250
非常...
Very...

178
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
抱歉
sorry

179
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,740
我想我有些幻觉
I feel I'm having visions.

180
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,640
那是因为头部创伤
It's the head trauma.

181
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,090
一段时间内 你会无法依赖自己的意识
You won't be able to trust your own thoughts for a while.

182
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,670
我看见一个瘟疫面具
I saw a plague mask.

183
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:45,150
有点像中世纪医生 ... 在黑死病肆虐时期的形象
It's the kind the medieval doctors wore in... during the Black death.

184
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,460
你讲过类似的
You said something about that.

185
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,190
你在出租车里讲过 不过大多不连贯
You were talking in the cab it was mostly incoherent but...

186
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,710
但我的确听到"面具"两字
But I did hear the word mask.

187
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,100
还有吗
Anything else?

188

189
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,300
... 和地狱

190
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,770
还有位女士
And there's a woman.

191
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,540
那位女士 她看着 ...
The woman, she seemed...

192
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,790
寻找 就必寻见
Seek and find

193
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,500
呃 看着很吓人

194
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,240
不 你肯定有人我们可以联系一下的
No, you got to have somebody we should call.

195
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,030

I do? Why?

196
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,380
我的 ... 我有没有
My wat... Was I wearing

197
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,550
在去医院的时候戴着块手表
my watch when I was brought to the hospital?

198
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,990
没
No.

199
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,640
你没戴表
You weren't wearing a watch.

200
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,420
它对我意义重大 是我父母送的
It's important to me. It was a gift from my parents.

201
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,980
嘿 你该朝前看 忘掉它
Look, you should go ahead and clean up.

202
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,440
你的衣服沾血了 不过我想我有适合你穿的
Your clothes are covered in blood but I think I got something that might fit you.

203
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,830
你穿上后 我们就打电话给警方 行吗
Once you get dressed, we'll call the police, okay?

204
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,360
不 不 领事馆
No. No. The Consulate.

205

抱歉 我不是那种人
I'm sorry, I'm not like this.

227

232
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,790

00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,870
- 那你为什么带着它 - 我不知道

你怎么会有它 你从哪儿弄的

瞧 有个简单的法子
Look, there is a simple way

244
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,230
可以弄清楚它究竟是不是我的
to find out if this thing belongs to me.

245
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,940
我去用拇指打开它 或者尝试失败
Then my thumb will open it or it won't.

246
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,500
打开它 你疯了吗

如果它是病毒药剂 我打开后它会被释放吗

Uh, and what I'm involved with.

252
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,780

00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,790
那么 达成一致
So, we agree.

00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,280
我们把它打开
We're opening it.

269
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,820
可能是个法拉第指示器

但丁定义了现代社会中的地狱概念

Botticelli drew it but... Dante created hell as we know it.

280
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,290
这也是我的幻觉所见
This is what I have been seeing.

- Serpents. - The punishment for thievery.

287
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,650
受难吧 罪人们 为汝之孽付出代价
Suffer, you sinners. Pay for your sins.

288
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,380
那么你对为何拥有此物一无所知
So you have no idea why you have this?

289
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,890
我想现在或许该联系领事馆了
I think maybe we call the consulate now.

290
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,300
对
Right.

291
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,200
兰登教授
Professor Langdon?

292

兰登先生 管子还在吗

298
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,420
教授 我们找不着你 就无法帮你
Professor, we can't help you if we can't find you.

299
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,920
如果那是领事馆 他们又如何知情
If that's the consulate, how do they know?

300
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,680
因为他们本就知道
Because they know.

301
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,560
怎么办
What do we do?

302
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,170
告诉他们你在那儿

316
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,810
行动 拿回指示器 还有兰登

无论如何 把他抓回来
Whatever it takes, let's get him.

318
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,390
走 走 走 走 就现在
Go, go, go, go, now!

319
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,940
看这个 好奇怪
Look at this. This is odd.

320
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,530
这块区域是但丁的地狱第八层
This area here is Dante's 8th level of hell.

321
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,820
叫Malebolge 意为邪恶之囊
It's called the Malebolge, means evil ditches.

322
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,490
一共有十种罪恶
There's ten.

323
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:36,320
这儿的字母"R" 原画中并没有
This letter "R" here, is not in the original painting.

324
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,150
是后加的
It's been added.

325
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,400
还有一个
There's another one.

326
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,570

332
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,860
那是什么
What is that.

333
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,280
一段文字 那是英文吗
That's text. Is that in English?

334
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:08,660
唯有透过死亡之眼 才能瞥见真相
THE TRUTH CAN BE GLIMPSED ONLY THROUGH THE EYES OF DEATH.

335
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,030
佐布里斯特
ZOBRIST.

336
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,750
贝特朗·佐布里斯特

337
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,990

339
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,930
因激进观点而声名狼藉

340
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,490
他在这儿
Here he is.

341
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:34,350
人类经历了10万年
It took the earth's population a hundred thousand years

342
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,280
才繁衍出10亿人口
to reach a billion people.

343
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:40,960
在随后的100年 人口增长到20亿
And then just a hundred more to reach two billion.

344
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:47,420
再翻一番只花了50年 70年代人口40亿
And only fifty years to double again to four billion people in 1970.

345
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:52,520
现在 我们快有80亿了
We're nearly at eight billion now.

346
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:57,010
巴特利特以烧杯为例 (巴特利特：英国化学家)
Bartlett used the example of a beaker.

347
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,570
内有一个细菌细胞
With a single bacterium.

348
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,920
每分钟分裂一次 数目翻倍
One that divides and doubles every minute.

349
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,660
如果在11点整将第一个细菌细胞置于杯中
If you placed the first bacterium into the beaker at 11 o'clock.

350
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,010
12点整时杯就全满了
and it's completely full by 12.

351
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,250
在何时烧杯还是半满的呢
At what time is the beaker still only half full?

352
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,990
11:59

353
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,960
那就是现在的我们

还没失败
No fail.

356
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,420
距离午夜 我们还差一分钟
We're a minute to midnight.

357
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,550
每一次全球性的瘟疫灾难都可以被归咎于人口的过剩
Every single global ill that plagues the Earth can be traced back to human overpopulation.

358
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:44,700
而严肃的生育控制手段却毫无施行可能
But serious birth control measures they don't stand a chance.

359
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,100
耸人听闻 违背个人权利
Outrageous! Violation of my rights!

360
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:52,490
侵犯个人隐私 别来好为人师
Invasion of my privacy! Don't tell me what to do!

361
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,680
然而 我们仍在侵略自然环境
But still we keep attacking our own environment!

362
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:03,210
地球历史上已经有过5次物种大灭绝
They have been 5 major extinctions in the earth's history.

363
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,620
我们若不立即采取大胆行动
Unless we take bold immediate action

364
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:14,220
第六次就会轮到我们头上
the sixth extinction will be our own.

365
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,160
距离午夜 我们还差一分钟
We're a minute to midnight.

366
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,390
看起来他有挺多拥护者
Looks like he's got a lot of followers.

367
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,700
嗯 来自全球各地 五湖四海
Yeah, from all over the world.

368
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,500
他挺令人信服的
He is compelling.

369
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:34,620
在佐布里斯特消失的两年时间里 部分当局人员担心
The 2 year disappearance during which some authorities feared Zobrist

370
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,500
他可能研发了一种有害于免疫能力底下群体的病毒病原体
may have designed an opportunistic viral pathogen.

371
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,250
他制造了一种瘟疫病毒
He created a plague.

372
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,800
但 为什么是但丁
But, why Dante?

373
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,380
为什么是这幅"地狱图"
Why this map of hell?

374
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,370
这是拼图游戏 或者挑战吗
Is this supposed to be a puzzle or a challenge?

375
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,300
也可能是遗书
Or a suicide note.

376
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,650
3天前他自杀了
He killed himself 3 days ago.

377
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,600
等级
The levels.

378
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,430
罪恶等级是乱序的 这是困扰我的地方
The levels are out of order, that's what's been bothering me.

379
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:13,650
地狱这一层的次序被重新分布了
This circles of hell had been rearranged.

380
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,210
跟医院的女子是同一人
It's the same woman from the hospital.

381
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,650
我们不能待在这 肯定不能相信领事馆了
We can't stay here. We certainly can't trust the Consulate.

382
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,760
字母像布置时那样被加密 也不对
The letters are encrypted as committers, that's not right.

383
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:24,230
如果病毒真的存在 你知道有多少政府想要弄到手吗
If the plague exist, do you know how many governments would want it?

384
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,930
神棍 猜不出
Clerical profiteers, not there.

385
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:28,070
- 他们都会做些什么来得到这些 - 挑拨离间者 不是
- What they would do to get it. - Someone who discord dead, no.

386
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,130
生化武器
A biological weapon.

387
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,200
这些字母
The letters.

388
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:38,410
他把每种罪行都加上了字母 然后打乱次序
He has assigned a letter to each sin and then changed their order.

389
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,300
他设了一个字谜
He's made an anagram.

390
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,700
对了 字谜
Yes. Anagram.

391
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,490
走 我知道另一条路能出去
Let's go. I know another way out.

392
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,820
如果你带了手机 最好留在这儿
If you have phoned, best leave it here.

393
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,120
可能会被追踪
They might track it.

394
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,830
手机 衣服都不是我自个的
The phone? I'm not even wearing my own clothes.

395
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,630
很好 走吧
Good. Let's go.

396
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,050
罗伯特·兰登 世界卫生组织
Robert Langdon! World Health Organization! (WHO)

397
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,740
V, R, O.

398
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,230
我得重排这些字母 Over Code
I got to rearrange these letters, CATROVACER.

399
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,290
Covered Cat

400
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,250
天 这种东西我以前挺上手的
God. I used to be good at this.

401
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,430
Cerca trova.

402
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,350
意大利语 意为"寻找"和"发现"
It's Italian. It means "seek" and "find".

403
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,650
Cerca trova 好的
Cerca trova. Yes!

404
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,600
我知道我为什么会在佛罗伦萨了
I know why I am in Florence.

405
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:01,190
世界卫生组织已经抵达 待命

406
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,560
注意
Be advised.

407
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,150
来自巴黎的布沙尔探员已经到场
Agent Bouchard, from the Paris office is already here.

408
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,270
世界卫生组织 告诉我最新情况

布沙尔已经上去了

410
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,940

411
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,560
没有发现他
There's no sign of him.

412
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,120
布沙尔说兰登已经走了 指示器也不在
Bouchard says Langdon is gone and so is the pointer.

413
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,500
这可不行
Well, I need better.

414
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,590
你 你 你们全部都要表现得更好
I need better from you, from you, from all of us.

415
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,130
更像样
Better!

416
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,320
还要更迅速 更敏捷 别相信任何人
Work faster. Work smarter. Don't trust anyone.

417
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,700
大家加油吧
Let's do that.

418
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,490
- 去吧 - 是
- Let's go. - Yes.

419
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,950
情报看样子已经没用了
The information seems to be obsolete.

420
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,300
- 不要透露给秘书长 明白吗 - 明白
- Do not say anything to the secretary general. - OK

421
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,020
- 身份 - 瓦任莎
- Identification. - Vayentha.

422
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:49,200
- 继续 - 我要跟教务长通话
- Go ahead. - I need to speak to the provost.

423
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,690
稍等
Hold on.

424
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,500
亚得里亚海 (意大利东部地中海水域) 清晨 7:12
游艇"门达西乌姆号"
Adriatic Sea 7:12 AM
The Mendacium.

425
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,110
那么 WHO在追踪兰登这事上先你一步 瓦任莎
So, the WHO beat you to Mr. Langdon, Vayentha.

426
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,680
教务长可不喜欢这样
The provost isn't going to like that.

427
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,240
我知道 他想要清掉我了
I know. He's going to want to liquidate.

428
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,860
告诉他这儿不是柏林
Tell him this isn't Berlin.

429
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,110
他敢试 我就找上门
He tries anything and I will find him.

430
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,270
一小时内再试一遍 然后联系我们
Try to reacquire and make contact in 60 minutes.

431
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,630
你有没有在听 我不是一次性用品
Did you hear me? I am not disposable.

432
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:21,630
瓦任莎 抢先将法拉第指示器弄到手
Vayentha, get the Faraday pointer before the government does.

433
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,180
靠
Shit.

434
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,740
- 西姆斯先生 - 嗯
- Mr. Sims. - Mm.

435
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,960
事情出了点偏差
There's been a deviation.

436
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,320
听到这个真遗憾
Sorry to hear that.

437
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,490
- 什么行动 - 佛罗伦萨
- What operation? - Florence.

438
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:56,670
我们的新外勤似乎有点随性乱来了
Our new players seemed to have gone off script.

439
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:59,600
真够业余
How unprofessional.

440
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:04,620
现在WHO已经取代了我们的位置
And now the WHO has overtaken our position.

441
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,080
告诉瓦任莎 如果她还在乎这份工作
Tell Vayentha, if she values her position

442
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,890
她就该除掉兰登
she will remove Langdon.

443
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:16,040
毁尸灭迹
Body not found.

444
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,600
或者再妙点 拦路抢劫
Or better yet, a mugging gone awry.

445
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:22,320
来上一刀 我觉得 现金劫走 钱包留下
A blade, I think. Cash gone, wallet remains.

446
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:26,920
赶紧确认下 然后继续 继续 继续
Let's have a quick identification and move on. Move on, move on.

447
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,850
兰登教授已经脱离监视了
Professor Langdon is out of frame.

448
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,540
- 还带着管子吗 - 是的
- And in possession of the tube? - Yes.

449
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:43,040
他带着法拉第指示器
He has the Faraday pointer.

450
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,540
之前盯的那么紧
He was such a good frame.

451
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,980
- 瓦任莎的情况如何 - 无恙 但很焦虑
- What is Vayentha's condition? - Intact but anxious.

452
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,600
那也正常
She should be.

453
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,190
这位委托人究竟都让我们做了些什么
What in god's name has this client gotten us into?

454
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,940
不不不 只是个 ... 比方
No, no, no. This is uh... rhetorical.

455
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,590
我们什么时候准备好发布委托人的视频
When are we due to release the client's video?

456
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,690
视频刚到这
It just arrived.

457
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,070
他的指示是24小时内上传
His instructions were to upload it in 24 hours.

458
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,530
我现在想看一下
I want to look at it now.

459
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,160
但 委托人 佐布里斯特
But, the client, Mr. Zobrist.

460
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,510
委托人 委托人已经死了 我要看视频
The client, the client is dead. I want to see the video.

461
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:25,000
这是违约行为
That's a violation of our protocols.

462
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,490
我们不是政府 只是负责办事
We're not the government. We get things done.

463
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,360
阿博加斯特先生
Mr. Arbogast.

464
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:39,600
能够令我们在工作中得心应手的首要因素
Chief among the attributes that makes us so very good at our job

465
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:43,320
正是世人对我们存在的一无所知
is that as far as the world is concerned, we don't exist.

466
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:47,100
倘若这段视频暗示或甚至提及到我们
If this video implicates or even mentions us in anyway,

467
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:50,810
我就会基于客户权益考虑而中止其发布
I want to stop it's release. For the benefit of all our clients.

468
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,630
你要求过在流程操作中要避免异常事况 就这些
You asked me to avoid abnormalities in procedure, that's all.

469
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:57,910
如果佐布里斯特先生当初只是在假装正常交易 怎么办
What about Mr. Zobrist has ever remotely resembled normal.

470
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,760
- 那 我... - 也只是个比方
- Well, I... - Also rhetorical.

471
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,550
把视频带过来
Bring me the video.

472
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,060
在旧宫(维奇奥宫)的五百人大厅内 有一副著名壁画
马基雅维利大道 佛罗伦萨 意大利 上午 8:36
In the Vecchio's Hall of the Five Hundred, there's a famous mural,
Viale Machiavelli, Florence, Italy 8:36 AM

473
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,560
乔治奥·瓦萨里的"马西阿诺之战"
Giorgio Vasari's Battle of Marciano.

474
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,500
在壁画顶部附近 有一段密文
Near the top of the mural is a coded message

475
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,320
这也是艺术界中最著名的未解之谜
which is one the art world's most famous puzzles.

476
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,710
密文是什么
And what's the message?

477
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,430
Cerca trova.

478
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,950
寻找 就寻见
Seek and find.

479
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,090
在医院里 我一直念叨说我很抱歉
At the hospital, I kept saying I was sorry.

480
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,510
很抱歉 一遍又一遍
Very sorry, over and over.

481
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,080
好吧 也许那不是我的本意
Well, maybe that's not what I meant.

482
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,790
画家的名字 瓦萨里 我可能讲的是"瓦萨里"
The name of the artist, Vasari. I could have been saying Vasari.

483
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:31,930
很棒啊 感觉你清醒多了
That's good. You seem clearer.

484
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,530
- 是的 - 你的中间名叫什么
- I am. - What's your middle name?

485
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,490
呃 我挺清醒的
Well, I am.

486
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,330
嗯哼
Mm-hm.

487
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,490
佐布里斯特死了 但若病毒真的存在
Zobrist is dead but if his plague is real...

488
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:47,440
那这幅"地狱图" 就是他留给某人找到它的线索
Then this map is a trail he has left so someone can find it.

489
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,950
谁
Who?

490
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,890
嗯 跟他立场一致的人
Well, someone who believes the same as he does.

491
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,270
那就是你带着它的原因
And that's why you have it.

492
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,920
但我印象中从未见过他
Well, I don't remember ever meeting Zobrist.

493
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,960
你不记得的事情可多了
There's a lot you don't remember.

494
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,560
也许他们 也许他们之前找到你
Maybe they- Maybe they came to you.

495
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,090
征求过你的指引
Wanted your help with the path.

496
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,080
- 就因为我做过但丁的讲座 - 正是如此
- Because I lectured on Dante? - Exactly.

497
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,350
他们向你展示法拉第指示器 试着说服你支持那些主张
They showed you this Faraday pointer, tried to convince you of their cause.

498
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,930
- 大屠杀 - 你说过他挺令人信服的
- Mass murder? - You said you found him compelling.

499
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,520
那是指观点
His argument!

500
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,900
口才
His rhetoric.

501
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,550
绝非这些计划 佐布里斯特心理上有问题
Not his plan! Zobrist is a psychopath.

502
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,090
好吧 或许他们耍了你
Well, maybe they tricked you.

503
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,720
其实给了 ... 你认识的人
Sent... someone you knew.

504
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,030
离午夜还差一分钟
It's a minute to midnight.

505
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:34,360
- 那是对付咱们的吗 - 常理来看是的
- Is that for us? - Logic would suggest.

506
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,330
该死
Damn it!

507
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,140
这儿 快 跟上我
Here, come on. Follow me.

508
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,930
我们可以穿过花园到那儿
We could get there through the garden.

509
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,880
好的 旧宫在这边
Okay, the- the Palazzo Vecchio is this way.

510
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:15,920
过去一小时内 我们标记了她用信用卡购买的汽车
We just flagged the car charged to her credit card within the past hour.

511
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,730
安托万 你跟警方交涉了么
Antoine, did you talk to the police?

512
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,800
那边有见过咱们的警察
There are people who have seen me.

513
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:23,670
请跟当地警方合作
Please cooperate with local police officially.

514
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:32,240
WHO将负责监督波波利花园的搜查工作
W.H.O. will take charge overseeing the search at the Boboli Gardens.

515
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,870
把搜查犬调过来
Call in the search dogs.

516
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:44,100
我在警局里接到电话 前来支援你
I got called out from the police station to support you.

517
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,230
波波利花园 上午 8:42
Boboli Gardens 8:42 AM

518
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,450
我需要更多帮手
I need more people.

519
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,790
报告电台 发现嫌犯
Radio in, suspects found.

520
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:28,630
该死的 四组 检查北边
Damn it! Delta, check the north perimeter.

521
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,640
这儿下去有扇灰色的小门
There's a small gray door down here.

522
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,740
直通瓦萨里长廊
It will take us into the Vasari corridor.

523
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:38,730
穿过维奇奥桥 就进到了宫里
Right across the Ponte Vecchio, and into the Palazzo.

524
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,370
- 门在那 看 - 哦
- That's the door, see. - Yeah.

525
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,640
就现在
Now!

526
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,920
花园是不是被墙整个围住的
Is the garden completely walled.

527
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,290
四面全封闭
On all sides.

528
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,430
唯一的出口要穿过北面的碧提宫
The only exits are through the Palazzo Pitti, on the north side,

529
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,080
或者通过东西两侧接待游客的大门
and through the visitors gates on the east and west sides.

530
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,180
没有别的出路了
No other way out?

531
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,340
如果瓦萨里长廊大门也算的话
I suppose if you count the Vasari gate.

532
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,950
不过那门很老 鲜有人知
But it's ancient, no one knows about that.

533
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,650
兰登知道
Langdon does.

534
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,700
教授现在是个麻烦了 瓦任莎
The Professor has become a liability, Vayentha.

535
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:30,280
教务长已经发布了诛杀令 除掉兰登
The provost has issued a kill order. Eliminate Langdon.

536
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,760
如若失败 你要负责 我说得够清楚了吗
Fail, and you will be held accountable. Am I making myself clear?

537
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,660
明白了 长官
Copy that, sir.

538
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,000
旧宫五百人大厅 早上 9:13

539
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,530
那儿
There.

540
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:59,470
瓦萨里的壁画 马西阿诺之战
That's the Vasari fresco, The Battle of Marciano.

541
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,530
那儿 那儿 看 看 看 看
There. There. Look. Look, look, look.

542
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,260
好的 看那两栋农舍 壁画中间往上
Okay, see the 2 farmhouses, dead center up high,

543
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,020
往4点钟方向下移一点
come down to it's 4 o'clock,

544
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,640
你就看到一小面绿色战旗
and you'll see a small green flag.

545
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,760
- Cerca trova - 对
- Cerca trova. - Yeah.

546
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,070
寻找 就寻见
Seek and find.

547
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,950
寻找 就寻见
Seek and find.

548
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:58,450
咱们看到了 找到了
We sought it and we found it.

549
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,450
那么 现在做什么
So, now what?

550
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,840
佐布里斯特加到画里的话
The words Zobrist added to the painting.

551
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,780
唯有透过死亡之眼 才能瞥见真相
The truth can be glimpsed only through the eyes of death.

552
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,660
死亡之眼
Eyes of death.

553
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,810
谁的眼睛
Whose's eyes?

554
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,910
我是不是被注射了什么东西
Was I given an injection?

555
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:54,820
什么时候
When?

556
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,450
- 医院里面 颈动脉注射 - 没有
- At the hospital, with a hypertenol? - No.

557
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,100
没有 你是插管输液治疗 只有静脉滴注
No, you were intubated. Anything you got came through the IV.

558
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,410
不在医院里
Not at the hospital.

559
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:08,100
我当时身着正装 在车厢后座上
I was fully dress. I was in the back of some car...

560
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,380
大概是过去两天里的某个时候
at some point in the last 2 days.

561
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,790
有东西注入了我的血液里
And something was injected into my bloodstream.

562
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,610
然后现在我开始外现临床病状
and now I'm showing signs of an illness

563
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:19,790
会不会是...
What if...?

564
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,100
会是什么
What if what?

565
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:27,550
西恩娜 我会不会就是携带者
Sienna, what if I'm the carrier?

566
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:30,480
你看
Look.

567
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:34,140
如果你携带了 那我也会被感染
If you've got it then I've got it too.

568
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:38,000
还有我们接触过的每个人同样如此 都会死掉
And everyone we've come into contact with has it and will likely die.

569
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,210
但如果并非如此
But if you don't.

570
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,680
如果 如果他们注射的是药剂或致幻剂 或者别的东西
If-If they gave you an anotic or a hallucinogen or anything else.

571
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,360
那么我们仍有机会挽救这半个世界
Then we still have a chance to save half the world.

572
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,890
值得一试 不是么
It's worth a try, isn't it?

573
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,310
教授
Professor.

574
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,640
啊 真是你 你怎么这么快就回来了
Ah, it is you. Why are you back so soon?

575
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,640
我不知道她是谁
I have no idea who this woman is.

576
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:14,080
你这身行头我差点没认出来 在逛街吗
I almost didn't recognize you in that suit. You've been shopping?

577
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,330
教授 你的头被撞了
Professor, you bumped your head.

578
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:22,170
是的 洗澡的时候 暴跌一跤
In the shower, yes. It's quite a tumble.

579
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,210
- 哎呀 - 嗯
- Ayes. - Yeah.

580
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:27,300
打扰一下 这位是西恩娜 我的侄女
I'm sorry. This is Sienna, my niece.

581
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:31,140
你人在意大利呢 教授 不必提这个
You're in Italy, Professor, you don't have to say 'niece'.

582
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,640
- 不是 不是的 - 不是的 他没有
- No. No. - No, he's not.

583
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:36,990
你好 玛塔·阿尔瓦雷兹 很高兴见到你
Hello. Marta Alvarez. Pleasure to meet you.

584
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:39,670
伊格纳奇奥(小主教座堂)也跟你一块来了吗
Is Ignazio with you again?

585
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:42,480
- 伊格纳奇奥 - 对
- Ignazio? - Yeah.

586
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:54,080
伊格纳奇奥今早没能成行
Ignazio couldn't make it this morning.

587
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:58,200
很抱歉打搅你一下 玛塔 不过
I'm sorry to bother you, Marta. But...

588
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:03,810
我想你大概能想到我为什么会在这里 又一次
I can imagine you know why I'm back. Again.

589
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,740
真的吗
Really?

590
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:08,980
旧宫里头这么多的珍宝
Of all the treasures in the Palazzo.

591
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,430
昨天晚上他跟小主教座堂在那上面待了将近一个钟头
He and il Duomino spent almost an hour with it up there last night.

592
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,450
真的 非同寻常
It's-It's so morbid.

593
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:19,740
哪里哪里 这很正常
No. No. It's cool.

594
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:23,390
好了 来吧 我来带路
Alright, come on. I'm headed up that way.

595
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:32,520
他真是足智多谋的一个能人
He's an extremely resourceful man.

596
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,580
我也对你说过这话 布沙尔先生
I was told you were as well, Mr. Bouchard.

597
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,150
那么 告诉我
So. Tell me.

598
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,600
你觉得他在干嘛
What do you think he's doing?

599
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:44,010
你觉得你在干嘛
What you think you doing?

600
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:46,230
我把指示器带给你 现在它没了
I brought you the pointer and now it's gone.

601
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,460
- 你弄丢了 - 我们在街上跟丢了他
- You have a leak. - We losed him in the street.

602
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,480
在医生的住处又重新发现了
Reacquired him at the doctor's apartment.

603
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,190
有大家支持 我还能掌控
I can handle with some ground.

604
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,880
- 我们不需要你帮忙 - 如果他受伤了
- We don't need your help. - What if he's injured.

605
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,880
头部受创
A head wound.

606
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,470
什么意思 你认为他糊涂了
What? You think he's confused.

607
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,080
- 他不知道他在干嘛吗 - 有可能
- He doesn't know what he's doing? - It's possible.

608
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:05,620
他晚上失踪前进展到了哪里
How far did he get the night before he disappeared?

609
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:07,750
五百人大厅
To the Hall of Five Hundred.

610
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:11,310
那我们就不追了
So let's stop chasing him,

611
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,090
提前守着他
anticipate him instead.

612
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:29,230
嘿 朋友 还请悠着点
Whoa, inspector. Not so fast, please.

613
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,410
我快燃起来了
I'm about to burst.

614
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,660
这么浪漫的一天 他却带你来欣赏死亡面具
Such a romantic date he takes you on. To see a death mask.

615
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,370
是的 在16世纪 它们相当普遍
Yeah, they were common practice in the 1500s.

616
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,360
实质上就是某个人面部的石膏模型
It's essentially just a plaster cast of someone's face,

617
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,650
在其死后不久套模浇注的
made a few moments after that person dies.

618
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,570
"透过死亡之眼"
"Through the eyes of death."

619
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:50,700
这幅面具的模型 是一位诗人
The person who was used for this mask, the poet,

620
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,770
叫但丁
Dante.

621
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,780
我想这是一个浪漫的故事
It is a romantic story I supposed.

622
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,760
但丁热爱这座城市 他在当时很显赫 又有影响力 但
Dante loved Florence, he was prominent and powerful. But...

623
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,650
在政治权力更迭后 他被罢黜流放
The political winds changed and he was exiled.

624
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,950
人们威胁他 若胆敢回来 就火刑伺候
They threatened to burn him at the stake if he ever returned.

625
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:13,140
实际上 有人认为对但丁的放逐 是面具看着如此悲恸的原因
Actually, some people say Dante's exile is the reason his death mask looks so sad.

626
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:17,260
不 不对 那是因为比阿特丽斯的原因 ("神曲"中的人物)
No. No. It was because of Beatrice.

627
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:21,620
但丁只从远处见过她 但她却被其终生迷恋
Dante only knew her from afar but he was obsessed with her his entire life.

628
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:24,990
你的侄女很浪漫呢 教授
Your niece is a romantic, Professor.

629
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:30,300
人们认为 但丁所撰的穿越地狱之行 实际上是为了找到她
They say Dante wrote in fact about his journey out of hell to reach her.

630
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,300
但他没能成功
But he never made it.

631
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,310
她已嫁给另主
She married someone else.

632
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:37,330
这事常常发生
That happens.

633
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:38,800
有吗
Does it?

634
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,960
谁撇下了谁
Who left who?

635
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:43,770
有些东西 若你不加以照料 就会难以为继
Things fall apart if you don't look after them.

636
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,260
噢 馆方要求 参观时你们只能站在立柱外
Oh. We ask that you stay behind the stanchions. Please.

637
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:48,130
谢谢
Thank you.

638
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,270
来得很巧 教授 我们刚刚开门
Good timing, Professor. We've only just opened.

639
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,090
玛塔...
Marta...

640
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,630
在
Yes?

641
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,440
那儿 那是我们
There. That's us.

642
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,430
那是伊格纳奇奥·布索尼 ("小主教座堂")
That's Ignazio Busoni.

643
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:43,050
我们相识多年
I've known him for years.

644
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,460
他是研究但丁的学者
He's the Dante scholar.

645
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:51,200
面具的主人坚持要求参观者要站在立柱之外
The mask's owner insists on the stanchions to keep people back.

646
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:54,470
未经许可 工作人员也不能打开展柜
He doesn't even permit staff to open the case without him present.

647
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:57,390
所以面具不是博物馆所有
So the mask is not owned by the museum?

648
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:59,430
不是 有位私人收藏家从我们手里买下了
No. A private collector bought it from us,

649
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,780
并允许我们做永久性展览
and allows us to display it in perpetuity.

650
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:05,480
这是筹集经费的惯常做法
It's a common practice, to raise funds.

651
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,360
他是何许人也
Who is the collector?

652
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,850
贝特朗·佐布里斯特 那位亿万富翁
Bertram Zobrist, the billionaire.

653
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,800
他的观点很古怪 但其自杀之事仍旧令人遗憾
His ideas were quite eccentric, but still it's such a shame what happened.

654
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,850
那就是我接电话的时候了
That's when I got the call.

655
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,510
喔
Oh.

656
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:51,910
教授 我 我不知道该作何感想
Professor, I... I don't know what to think!

657
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:54,220
我很震惊
I am appalled!

658
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:07,270
- 教授 - 兰登教授
- Professor. - Professor Langdon.

659
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:10,540
瞧 这事情肯定有个解释
Look. There's an explanation for all this.

660
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:15,000
警察来了 警铃响了
The police came and the alarm went off.

661
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,500
这些都是什么人
Who are they?

662
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,100
他们都是特工人员
They're government agents.

663
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,700
你有客人了
You have an intruder.

664
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:24,180
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

665
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,680
玛塔 别让他俩跑了
Marta, don't let them go.

666
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:31,300
你不能带枪进这来
You can not bring a gun here.

667
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,860
教授
Professor.

668
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:49,800
教授 我非常尊敬您 但我不明白
Professor, I very much respect you but I do not understand.

669
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,990
- 请坐 我会解释 - 你为什么做这事
- Please sit down. I'm going to explain this. - Why you have done this?

670
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:54,820
- 那可不行 - 玛塔 我不知道面具在哪儿
- This is not okay. - Marta, I do not know where the mask is.

671
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:57,590
但我会竭尽全力找到它 还给你们
But I will do everything I can to find it and return it to you.

672
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,590
教授 你在干嘛 教授 求你 不要
Professor, what are you doing? Professor, please. No.

673
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:03,070
教授 回来 别这样
Professor, come back. Don't do that.

674
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,470
教授 请不要
Professor, please don't.

675
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,590
- 嘿 嘿 - 教授
- Hey. Hey. - Professor.

676
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:08,810
- 你别跟着就好 - 求你了 别这样
- Just don't follow us. - Please, don't do this.

677
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,430
教授
Professor!

678
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,360
咱们偷偷找条路子离开这儿
Let's just calmly find a way out of here.

679
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:30,960
你为什么不告诉我伊格纳奇奥的事情
Why didn't you tell me about Ignazio?

680
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,590
如果你知道我是个贼 你还会帮我吗
Would you help me if you knew I was a thief?

681
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:35,210
你向我求助的时候撒了谎
You lied to me when you asked for my help.

682
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,410
对 严格说来 我有所保留
Well technically, I withheld.

683
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,350
如果我真的拿了那副面具...
If I really took that mask...

684
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,000
你的确拿了 我刚刚才看到
You did take the mask, I just saw you.

685
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:47,640
这不是你的问题 你不必跟着
This is not your problem. You don't have to stay.

686
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,860
我当然要陪着 人类正面临生死存亡
Of course, I do. Human lives are at stake.

687
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:52,620
我只想知道我没站错队
I just want to know that I'm on the right side.

688
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,020
你没有
You are.

689
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:56,260
我发誓
I swear.

690
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,770
好的
Good.

691
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:00,610
现在咱们去找到要找的东西
Now let's find what we're looking for.

692
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:04,880
打给伊格纳奇奥 问他面具藏哪儿了
Call this Ignazio, and ask him where he hid the mask.

693
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:13,180
伊格纳奇奥失踪了 不知藏身何处
Ignazio's disappeared. He had gone into hiding.

694
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,210
他说过
He said.

695
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,280
别人也在追着他 但他留了条线索
They were chasing him too but he left a clue.

696
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,610
一封邮件 "天堂 25"
An email, "Paradise Twenty-five".

697
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:26,050
指的是但丁"神曲"中的天堂篇第25诗章 不过
That's a reference to Dante's Divine Comedy. "Canto XXV." But...

698
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,700
- 我现在需要那本书 - 一本书
- I need a copy of the book. - A copy of the book.

699
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,780
真荒诞 我会用谷歌
That's quaint. I use Google.

700
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:35,170
他们正在关闭博物馆 只开放主出口
They're closing down the museum, only the main exit is going to be open.

701
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:38,220
那我们就穿过亚美尼亚
Well, then we'll go through Armenia.

702
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,750
...从正门有序离开
...Go out to the front door in an orderly manner.

703
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:06,280
现已封锁全部出口
All exit doors are now sealed.

704
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,080
这是唯一的进出通道
This is the only way in or out.

705
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:11,500
有没有隐藏的出口 隧道 隐门之类的
What about hidden exits? Tunnels, concealed doorways?

706
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:15,440
这地方700年了 先生 这类玩意很多
It's a 700 year old Palazzo, Signore, there are a number of them.

707
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:16,980
带我看看
Show me.

708
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,830
亚美尼亚
ARMENIA

709
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,250
教授 真是刮目相看
Professor. How worldly.

710
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,950
旧宫的秘密之一
Secrets of the Palazzo Invisibile.

711
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:48,740
这段路很赞 改天你也试试
It's a great tour, you should take it sometime.

712
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:52,740
我们在这儿暂时安全了
We should be safe here for a minute.

713
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,980
进去
Go.

714
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:07,370
"到那时 我将带着另一个声音 另一身羊毛..."
"By then with other voice, with other fleece..."

715
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:12,090
"我将作为诗人回归 并且
在我的洗礼盆中接受那花冠..."
"I shall return as poet and put on,
at my baptismal font, the laurel crown..."

716
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:13,140
洗礼盆
Baptismal font.

717
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:15,890
圣母百花大教堂 但丁受洗之地
(译注: Il Duomo实指佛罗伦萨主教座堂广场建筑群 包括圣母百花大教堂 圣若望洗礼堂 乔托钟楼等)
Il Duomo. The Cathedral where Dante was baptized.

718
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:19,830
也是伊格纳奇奥工作的地方 他把面具藏在那了
That's where Ignazio works. That's where he hid the mask.

719
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,240
不在这儿
It is not here.

720
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:27,890
他们会认为我们正前往出口
They're going to think we're heading down to the exit.

721
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:31,540
那么我们往上走
Then we go up.

722
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,660
好的
Alright.

723
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,240
我们正在五百人大厅上面
We're right above the Hall of Five Hundred.

724
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:57,470
另一头有道楼梯 直通大街
There's a stairway leading down to the street on the other side.

725
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:58,680
那么
So.

726
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:01,630
一次迈一步
One step at a time.

727
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,480
行吗
Okay?

728
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,480
你恐高不
Are you afraid of heights?

729
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:18,990
有点儿
A little.

730
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,870
我倒是有点儿幽闭恐惧症
I'm uncomfortable in tight spaces.

731
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:24,760
那么 别往下看
So, don't look down.

732
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:28,290
或者就往下看 我记不得了
Or do. I can never remember which.

733
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:06,610
没那么难
It's not that hard.

734
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:16,700
来吧 走
Come on, go.

735
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,140
西恩娜
Sienna!

736
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:34,790
你还好吗
Are you alright?

737
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:36,450
- 你还好吗 - 还好
- You okay? - Yeah.

738
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,620
好的 只要... 慢慢去到那边横梁上
Alright, just... crawl along that beam there.

739
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:42,490
我在另一边跟你碰头 楼梯附近
And I'll meet you on the far side, by the ladder.

740
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,040
长官
Sir.

741
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:54,750
调派六个人到这来 不用戒备了
Give me a six men stationed here. Safeties off.

742
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,940
你现在变蠢了 兰登教授
You're being stupid now, Professor Langdon!

743
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,810
走 走 离开这儿 走
Go. Go. Get out of here, go!

744
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,340
他们一度需要你 但如今心意已改
They needed you but now they changed their minds.

745
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:53,800
把人都赶走 大家都离开 清空现场
Get these people out. Everyone out, clear the room.

746
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,930
把它给我
Give me that.

747
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:13,440
那些门 这儿
These doors, here.

748
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:16,060
- 东面 他们去那了 - 收到
- Eastern side. That's where they're headed. - Okay.

749
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,110
走 行动 快点
Go, move. Quickly!

750
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:11,640
布沙尔 布沙尔探员 回话
Bouchard. Agent Bouchard, come in.

751
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:16,800
你在哪儿 布沙尔探员 回话
What is your location? Agent Bouchard, come in.

752
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:19,200
重生
REBIRTH

753
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:22,780
寄来视频的信封上也有这个词
That same word is on the envelope the video arrived in,

754
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:25,870
上面还有一个日期 是明天
along with the date. The date is tomorrow.

755
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:29,770
谢谢 这些我知道
Well, thank you, that was not lost on me.

756
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,890
地狱中最黑暗的地方 是为那些
The darkest places in hell are reserved for those

757
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:37,390
在道德危机时刻皂白不辨的人而准备的
who refuse to act in time of moral crisis.

758
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:42,080
但丁的地狱并非虚构 它是预言
Dante's hell isn't fiction anymore, it's prophecy.

759
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:45,480
我们已经在这个星球上打造了人间地狱
We have created our own hell on earth.

760
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,270
天呐
Oh my.

761
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:50,570
警告已然很明显 对策却被忽略了
The warnings have been obvious, the solutions ignored.

762
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:53,090
因此 我采取了行动
So, I took action.

763
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:57,290
如果你看到了这则视频 就意味着地狱病毒
If you are watching this, it means the Inferno virus was released

764
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,710
已在昨晚午夜被释放
last night at midnight, and...

765
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:02,620
现在早就传遍了全球各个角落
it's now being carried to every corner of the Earth.

766
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:04,450
天呐
Oh my.

767
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:08,870
在释放后的6天内 病毒会不断增殖 (译注: 上帝创造天地用时6天)
Within 6 days of it's released, the virus will replicate itself.

768
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:13,000
地球上的全体人类数量
And every man, woman and child on Earth expect the current...

769
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,870
将会随机减半
the current population to be culled by half.

770
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:21,180
幸存者则将见证
The survivors will witness

771
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:27,370
这个星球上前所未有的恐怖
horrors... unknown to this planet.

772
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:30,570
但我想让大家知道原由
But I want them to know why.

773
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:35,440
这就是吾之所为 这就是吾之救赎
That this was our doing and this is our salvation.

774
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,270
现在时候已到
Now is the time.

775
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:40,440
今天是...
Today is...

776
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:41,890
后面还有
There's more.

777
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:44,100
我相信我已经明白了视频主旨
I believe I've got the gist.

778
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,380
很明显过去数年以来
It appears our organization has spent

779
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,230
我们在跟一个试图通过自行研发的致命病毒
the last several years in the employ of a madman

780
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:52,890
来发动人口大屠杀的疯子在打交道
who now intends to commit a mass murder using a deadly plague of his own creation

781
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,820
在接下来24小时的某一刻 ... 抱歉
in some point in the next 24... Sorry.

782
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,370
不到12小时了
Less than 12 hours.

783
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:01,580
那么 咱们尽吾所能 不要再
So, let's do our level best not to fuck things up

784
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:05,500
把事儿进一步搞砸了 好吗
any worse than we already have, shall we?

785
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:09,710
没了法拉第指示器 没人能找到病毒
Without the Faraday pointer, no one can find the virus.

786
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:11,310
兰登教授现在在哪
Where is Professor Langdon now?

787
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:15,000
他之前跟布鲁克斯医生在波波利花园 但情报似乎断了
He was with Dr. Brooks in the Boboli Gardens but we seemed to have lost visual.

788
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:17,680
我们恐怕也有很久没有联系上瓦任莎了
And I'm afraid we have no contact from Vayentha.

789
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:19,230
知道了
I see.

790
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:22,320
我亲自去佛罗伦萨
I'm going to Florence myself.

791
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:36,990
给她做传染性检查 把这里隔离起来
Test her for signs of contagion and quarantine this place.

792
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,260
如果不尽快找到兰登
If we don't find Langdon very soon,

793
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,470
我们很快就会看到更多死尸
we are going to be looking at a great many more dead bodies.

794
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:09,100
你还好吗
Are you alright?

795
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,010
虚弱
It's weakness.

796
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:15,060
只是虚弱 该死的
Just weakness, god damn it.

797
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,650
我们歇一会儿
We'll just take a moment.

798
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:19,850
你见到她掉下去了吗
Did you see her down there?

799
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,600
是的
Yes.

800
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:24,780
自打我11岁开始 全部所做所学
Everything I've done, every bit of work and studies since I was eleven

801
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:26,800
就是去救死扶伤 而不是置人死地
is to stop death, not cause it.

802
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:29,720
那只是自卫 有人要刺杀咱们
It was self defense. Someone was trying to kill us.

803
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:32,390
我不知道能不能跟下去了
I don't know if I can finish this.

804
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:37,570
你不能的话 我完全理解
I understand if you can't.

805
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:41,980
看 佐布里斯特才是谋杀犯 不是你
Look, Zobrist is the murderer, not you.

806
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:44,490
你救了我
You saved me.

807
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:47,510
你本不必采取行动的
You don't have to take another step.

808
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:51,620
嗯 说的没错
Yeah, you're right.

809
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,320
我做了应该做的 若有必要 我还会再来一遍
I did what was necessary and I'll do it again if I need to.

我祈愿这是最后一次

在合力寻找并外销病毒

Let's get to the point. You know where the virus is?

865
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:52,620
我猜你应该有身份证明吧
I assume you have some sort of credentials.

866

要问WHO的话你请便

不 不是日内瓦 他说是威尼斯
No, not Geneva. He said Venice.

874

我听到了

- This is the plane to Geneva? - Yes, but we just closed the door.

880
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:37,790
让飞机待那别动 我们要检查全部乘客
Keep the plane at the gate. We need to check every passenger.

881
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:40,190
那就是在浪费时间了
That would be a waste of time.

882
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,500
而且我们的时间很紧
And we have very little of that.

887
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:05,690
装有"地狱图"的法拉第指示器
The Faraday pointer with the map of hell.

888
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:10,300
是一个谜题 专门为其拥护者解谜而设计的
A puzzle, specifically designed for his followers to solve.

889

我们把它交给了你
We brought it to you.

890
01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:13,750
你正在解密的时候
And you were in the process of decoding it,

891
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:15,690
被人给绑架了
when you were kidnapped.

892
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:19,900
兰登教授

Did she tell you about any third party interest in the virus?

895
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:39,170
- 不记得了 - 她在经济上是不是有困难
- I don't remember. - Did she have financial problems?

896
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:40,340
呃 我不知道

897

Then tell me who can remember, Professor! Enough with the "I don't know, I don't remember."!

901
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,530
这样对他不好
It's not good for him.

902
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:55,870
那个"金碧辉煌的博学园"是在威尼斯圣马可大教堂内

Can I see that?

906

是我我就不会碰它
I wouldn't touch it.

907

928
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:36,950
他不是那天来找我的人
He was not the one who came to Cambridge to see me.

929
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:54,290
布沙尔 快来帮我 快点 我觉得他虚脱了

你在告诉我过去两年来

没错
That is correct.

938
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:42,430
掩饰贝特朗·佐布里斯特和他的研究

943
01:11:55,730 --> 01:12:01,960
现在你又冒冒失失的跑来 要求我相信你
Now you have the temerity to ask that I simply decide to trust you?

944
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:06,320
非常抱歉 在我看来 别无他法
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't see any other way.

945
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:13,710
你的团队 到底是干什么的
Who exactly does your group work for?

946
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:18,820
当然是服务于客户
Our clients, of course.

947
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:23,000
我们是一家私人安保公司 运作得很成功
We are a private security firm. A very successful one.

948
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:24,890
我可以请问一下
May I ask,

949
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,850
之前与你共事的那位绅士 布沙尔探员
the gentleman who was with you, agent Bouchard,

950
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:31,340
他现在在哪儿
where is he now?

951
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,140
我们不得而知 他已经失去行踪了
We don't know. We lost track of him.

952
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:38,040
那么现在的情况要比你们想像的还糟
Then the situation is worse than you think.

953
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:40,880
只有唯一一种原因会令他选择失联
There is only one reason he would move out of contact,

954
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:43,030
他想要独自找到兰登先生
he wants Mr. Langdon to himself.

955
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:43,980
为什么
Why?

956
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,180
找到病毒 然后再抬价转手 我猜的
To find the virus and sell it to the highest bidder I assume.

957
01:12:47,210 --> 01:12:50,290
借贷收购 敲诈勒索 你懂的 老一套
Leverage, blackmail, you know, the usual shit.

958
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:53,450
我觉得咱们不必再深入讨论了 西姆斯先生
I don't think we have anything further to discuss, Mr. Sims.

959
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:56,760
寻找病原体的时间已经不足8小时 抱歉
And I have less than 8 hours to find this pathogen, excuse me.

960
01:12:56,780 --> 01:13:01,030
据我所知 在此之前你就认识教授
From what I understand, you knew the Professor sometime ago.

961
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,680
有过私交
Personally.

962
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:08,290
你在乎他
You care about him.

963
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:15,780
你甚至会为了保护他 而跟像我这种不择手段的人合作 不是吗
You would even ally with an unscrupulous character
such as myself to protect him, wouldn't you?

964
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:23,650
我的组织就有找到兰登教授的资源
My organization has the resources to find your Professor.

965
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,830
威尼斯 意大利 下午 2:49

966
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,020
若你想要散播瘟疫 这儿就是理想之地
If you wanted to start a plague, this is where you do it.

967
01:13:54,050 --> 01:13:55,470
没错
Yep.

968
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:59,730
这儿每年有两千万游客来自全球各地的游客
20 million people a year come here from every corner of the globe.

969
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:03,700
14世纪黑死病肆虐期间 威尼斯人号令全部船只
During the Black Death, the Venetians made all the ships

970
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,580
在港口抛锚停泊40天
anchored in the harbor for 40 days,

971
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:07,680
随后才允许船员入城
before they would allow the crews into the city.

972
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:10,620
以确保瘟疫不会传入城内
Making sure that they were not carrying the Plague.

973
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:12,810
英文中"隔离"一词就是来自意大利语
The word "Quarantine" comes from the Italian.

974
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,750
还有"四十" 来自"Quaranta"
"quaranta", "forty".

975
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:18,610
有你陪同感觉很棒呢 教授
It's nice to have you back, Professor.

976
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:23,260
那儿 马雕在那儿 (圣马尔谷之马)
There, the horses.

977
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:33,260
都是复制品 原件在圣殿内部保管 (原因: 空气污染)
These were recreations, the originals are in a museum for preservation.

978
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:36,400
得赶紧了 布沙尔知道我们会到这儿
We should be quick. Bouchard knows we are coming here.

979
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:38,830
打扰一下
Excuse me.

980
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:43,080
问一下那位导游 这些雕塑的马头有没有被切下过
Ask that guide, if the heads have ever been severed from these horses?

981
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:46,140
打扰一下 打扰一下
Excuse me. Excuse me.

982
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:47,990
- 打扰一下 - 麻烦了 打扰一下
- Excuse me. - Please excuse me.

983
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:49,420
麻烦了
Please.

984
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,600
传说在第四次十字军东征期间(1202年 - 1204年)
According to the tale, during the Crusades,

985
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,650
这些马雕被威尼斯军队从拜占庭的君士坦丁堡(今伊斯坦布尔)劫走
the horses were looted from Constantinople.

986
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:07,510
马匹...
Horses...

987
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:12,460
但它们实在太大 难以装船
But they were too large to be loaded on board the ships,

988
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:17,000
所以马头被切下 随后再重新接回
so their heads were removed and reattached.

989
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:18,510
哪位总督干的
By whom?

990
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:21,500
那位长生不老的总督 恩里科·丹多洛 (第41任威尼斯总督)
The doge who lived forever, Enrico Dandolo.

991
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:24,390
- 恩里科·丹多洛 - 长生不老的总督
- Enrico Dandolo. - The doge who lived forever.

992
01:15:24,410 --> 01:15:26,000
当然了 恩里科·丹多洛
Of course, Enrico Dandolo.

993
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:28,280
丹多洛把威尼斯人骗入十字军中
Dandolo tricked the Venetians into the Crusades.

994
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:33,190
他原本应当率众前往埃及 却跑去把君士坦丁堡给洗劫了
He was supposed to sail his ships to Egypt, but he sacked Constantinople instead.

995
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:35,350
我很抱歉 当然是他了
I'm sorry. Of course.

996
01:15:35,370 --> 01:15:37,970
"金碧辉煌的神圣智慧博学园"
"The gilded museum of holy wisdom."

997
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,980
我们找错了教堂吗
Are we in the wrong basilica?

998
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:43,080
我们找错了国家
We're in the wrong country.

999
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,010
丹多洛逝世后 并没有埋葬在此
Dandolo passed, but he was not buried here.

1000
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:47,650
那他葬在哪里
So where was he buried?

1001
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,640
圣索菲亚大教堂
Hagia Sophia.

1002
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:52,270
- 伊斯坦布尔 - 伊斯坦布尔 (土耳其)
- Istanbul. - Istanbul.

1003
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,000
总会有出路的
There's always a way out.

1004
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:43,020
在这儿 这儿
Here. Here.

1005
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:52,100
看看你能不能把那个打开来
See if you could get that open.

1006
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,670
我抓住你的脚了
I got your foot.

1007
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,480
能搞定吗
Can you get it?

1008
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:28,990
外头有人吗
Is there someone there?

1009
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:30,860
请帮一下
Please help.

1010
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:37,570
对 对
Yes.

1011
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:39,430
拉我一把
Give me a hand.

1012
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:41,750
- 100块 - 好的 好的
- One hundred. - Yes! Yes.

1013
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:44,310
- 100欧元 - 给 我有 我有的
- A hundred euro. - Here. I got it. I got it.

1014
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,340
快 快 快
Quick. Quick. Quick.

1015
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:17,870
谢谢
Thank you.

1016
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:40,130
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1017
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:45,700
你说过他是个谋杀犯 是个精神变态
You called him a murderer, a psychopath.

1018
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:48,300
什么
What?

1019
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,410
但历史会把我们视为救世主
But history will call us saviors.

1020
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,760
天呐 我的天呐
Oh my god. Oh my god.

1021
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:01,640
我不怕死 罗伯特
I'm not afraid to die, Robert.

1022
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:07,510
但无所事事才是令我害怕的
But doing nothing terrifies me.

1023
01:19:07,530 --> 01:19:12,720
指引 指示器 他是要留给你的 佐布里斯特
The path, and the pointer, he left that all for you, Zobrist.

1024
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:17,010
- 你认识他吗 - 何止认识
- You knew him? - Knew him?

1025
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,630
我爱他
I loved him.

1026
01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:22,550
你这套衣服就是他的
You're wearing his suit.

1027
01:19:23,410 --> 01:19:25,800
不 西恩娜 不
No. Sienna, no.

1028
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:27,600
谢谢你 罗伯特
Thank you, Robert.

1029
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:32,250
谢谢你做的一切
Thank you for everything.

1030
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:37,350
不 不 西恩娜 不要
No. No. Sienna, no.

1031
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:39,560
西恩娜
Sienna!

1032
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:42,850
不 西恩娜 西恩娜 不要
No, Sienna! Sienna, no!

1033
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,480
慢点 慢点 你太快啦
Slow down, slow down. You're too fast.

1034
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:39,120
噢 拜托 拜托
Oh, come on. Come on.

1035
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:41,390
这个费了我三天时间
This took me 3 days.

1036
01:20:41,410 --> 01:20:43,160
太简单啦
Too easy.

1037
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:45,260
"镀金时代" - 马克·吐温
"The Gilded Age" by Mark Twain

1038
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:55,140
我很喜欢
I love it.

1039
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:09,280
认识你之前
Everything before you exist,

1040
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:12,770
完美生活还是臆想
an idea.

1041
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:17,160
如今已经成真了
And now it's real.

1042
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:24,360
爱 让 灵魂 复苏
Love awaken the soul to act.

1043
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:34,320
这可不公平 拿但丁来比喻我
That's not fair. Quoting Dante to me.

1044
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:41,280
不过诗句里是"美" 而不是"爱"
But it's beauty, not love.

1045
01:21:56,350 --> 01:21:57,890
怎么了
What?

1046
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:03,360
离午夜还差一分钟
It's a minute to midnight.

1047
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:08,750
比我预想的还要早
Sooner than I expected.

1048
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,310
我们要去哪
Where're we going?

1049
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:22,310
噢
Oh.

1050
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,910
我明白了
I see.

1051
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:34,220
我们一同策划 一同构思
We planned it together, we designed it together,

1052
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:38,590
但这部分只有你才知晓
but this part only belongs to you.

1053
01:22:38,610 --> 01:22:43,120
你不知道在哪 才会更安全
It's just safer if you don't know where.

1054
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:48,230
如果他们抢先找到了你呢
What if they find you first?

1055
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,130
那时怎么办
What then?

1056
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,120
如果你想知道 你也不是一个人
If you want to know, you're not alone.

1057
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:03,360
你得开始相信我
You got to start by trusting me.

1058
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:06,510
我们若不立即采取大胆行动
Unless we take bold immediate action

1059
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:11,390
第六次大灭绝就会轮到我们头上
the sixth extinction will be our own.

1060
01:23:24,010 --> 01:23:25,590
你说得对
You were right.

1061
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:31,000
我要给你安排另一条路
I'm going to make you another path.

1062
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:35,430
地狱也在尽头
Inferno will be at the end.

1063
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:40,740
如果我遇到不测 第一条线索就会发给你
If something should happen to me, the first clue will be deliver to you.

1064
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:43,700
我知道你会做好必须要做的事情
I know you'll do what must to be done.

1065
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:46,300
寻找 就寻见
Seek and find.

1066
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:52,290
你不是一个人
You're not alone.

1067
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,370
那么
So.

1068
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,980
漂亮的小妮子跑去找坏家伙了
The beautiful young woman went for the bad guy.

1069
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:04,020
这事常常发生
That happens.

1070
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:07,460
你看着好失望呢
You look disappointed.

1071
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:10,540
我先让你缓一缓
I'll give you a minute.

1072
01:25:10,570 --> 01:25:15,560
伊丽莎白并非是想要转卖病毒的人
Elizabeth is not the one who wants the virus to sell.

1073
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,880
那人是你
You are.

1074
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,930
你被人利用了
You've been used.

1075
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:26,430
有人在精心计划 驱使你为他们效力
Elaborate schemes created by people to get you to do what they want.

1076
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,650
至于我
But me,

1077
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:33,110
我就简单粗暴了
I'm very direct.

1078
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:36,890
现在我正掌握一个绝佳的机会
And this is a moment of great opportunity for me.

1079
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:40,170
所以 病毒在哪里
So, where is the virus?

1080
01:25:45,170 --> 01:25:47,370
拜托 教授
Come on, Professor.

1081
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:50,410
人世间生命几何
How much life is there in the world?

1082
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:54,140
有多少生来就在困苦挣扎
How much more is fighting to be born?

1083
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:59,500
偶尔自相残杀也并无过错
Nothing wrong with thinning the herd once in a while.

1084
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:06,900
很正常
It's healthy.

1085
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:12,070
我已见过许多天意
I've seen many acts of god.

1086
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:16,500
我是说 台风 霍乱 你知道吗
I mean, typhoons, cholera. And you know what?

1087
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,700
有时候带走的 还是善人之命
Sometimes it hits the right people.

1088
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:24,700
- 惨无人性 - 人之常情本就是不人道的
- That's inhuman. - Humanity is inhuman.

1089
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:28,670
人命或许轻贱 但从未有人停止过
Life maybe cheap, but the means to end it on a mass scale,

1090
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:31,050
探求灭绝众生的方法手段
no one ever stops paying for that.

1091
01:26:39,090 --> 01:26:41,700
我再最后问你一...
I'm going to ask you for the last...

1092
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,890
万分抱歉
Terribly sorry.

1093
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,630
没别的法子了
Didn't see any other way.

1094
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:58,170
须得迅雷不及掩耳 见血越少 效果越好
Must do this quickly. The less blood the better.

1095
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:00,620
你是哪位
Who are you?

1096
01:27:01,710 --> 01:27:04,310
噢 一名协作者
Oh, a facilitator.

1097
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:07,550
除了别的业务 我们公司还制造幻觉
Among other things my company creates illusions.

1098
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:09,980
你的头部并没有受伤
You never had a real head wound.

1099
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:17,250
- 但我失忆了 - 是化学作用
- But I lost my memory. - Chemically induced.

1100
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:20,910
我们给你注射的是苯二氮䓬类药物 (精神药物)
We gave you an injection of benzodiazapenes.

1101
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:26,330
抱歉 会伴有皮疹 一两天后就消退
Sorry, it can produce a skin rash. It should fade in a day or so.

1102
01:27:29,770 --> 01:27:31,950
这些都是...
All this was a...

1103
01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:33,550
这些都是假的吗
All this was a fake?

1104
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:36,650
我更喜欢制造真实感
I prefer created reality.

1105
01:27:36,670 --> 01:27:40,910
我的手下绑架了你
My agents kidnapped you.

1106
01:27:40,930 --> 01:27:44,650
为了触发全新的剧情 他们消去了你的记忆
They cleared your memories so we could create a fresh scenario,

1107
01:27:44,670 --> 01:27:48,490
由此你便投身于协助我们的思路中
whereby you would be invested in the idea of helping us.

1108
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:55,280
我们在你头皮上划了一道小口子 这是枪击幻觉的一部分
A small incision was made in your scalp to give the impression of a bullet graze.

1109
01:27:56,870 --> 01:27:59,420
医院里的门也是假锁的
There are no locks on hospital doors.

1110
01:27:59,450 --> 01:28:01,070
没错
Exactly.

1111
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:02,490
满分回答
Highest marks.

1112
01:28:02,510 --> 01:28:05,970
医院里杀人的那位女警察呢
What about the policewoman who shot the Doctor in the hospital?

1113
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,240
也是我的人
Also it's me.

1114
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:09,000
她的枪里是空包弹
Her gun fired blanks.

1115
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,750
门上则有爆炸伪造的枪击效果
And there were squibs in the door.

1116
01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:13,850
医生是演员 身上挂着袋血浆包
The doctor was an agent wearing a blood packet.

1117
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:17,830
出租车司机 整个医院都是咱们的人
The taxi driver, the hospital was working for us as well.

1118
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:21,050
在旧宫里她试图要杀了我
At the Palazzo Vecchio she tried to kill me.

1119
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:23,530
那是真枪实弹
It was real bullets.

1120
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,070
我要求的
At my behest.

1121
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:28,520
当事情快要败露时
When things that appeared to go tits up

1122
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:30,670
我会试图赶紧杀人灭口 毁尸灭迹
I try to sweep it all away quickly.

1123
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:31,970
所以要杀我
By killing me?

1124
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,650
我深表歉意 兰登先生
I apologize unreservedly, Mr. Langdon.

1125
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:45,220
我的确失去了一名老部下
I did lose an experienced agent.

1126
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:50,530
这个行当里 我见过的情况够多了
There's a great deal of situation I've been informed in my line of work.

1127
01:28:52,290 --> 01:28:55,080
瞧 我知道的就这些
Look, hear me what I know.

1128
01:28:55,110 --> 01:28:57,630
我知道我看着很渗人
I know I've behaved terribly.

1129
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:05,350
但谜题需要破解 这一点你最棒了
But a puzzle needed solving, who better to solve it than you.

1130
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,790
瞟一眼 好吗
Glance at it, will you?

1131
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:23,450
干得差强人意了
Not my best work.

1132
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:26,700
但足以应付意大利人
But it will do for the Italians.

1133
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:32,720
西恩娜来找我求助的时候 佐布里斯特早已拥趸者众
Zobrist had followers everywhere when Sienna first came to me for help.

1134
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:34,710
至少我是这么认为的
Or so I thought.

1135
01:29:34,730 --> 01:29:39,320
佐布里斯特死后不久 她就很严肃地找上门来
She came to us with serious concerns shortly after Zobrist died.

1136
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:43,570
不知怎的 她知道了我们受雇于佐布里斯特
Somehow, she knew Zobrist had hired us.

1137
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:47,240
她表示这位富翁的生物研究成果 可能已经落到坏人手中
She said he was doing biological work that could be fallen into the wrong hands.

1138
01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:50,420
她并未提及瘟疫 但我们已经开始警惕
She didn't mention a plague. But we heard enough to be alarmed.

1139
01:29:50,450 --> 01:29:54,320
于是我们同意协助她 找到佐布里斯特的计划
So we agreed to work with her to find Zobrist's project.

1140
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:58,980
然后当辛斯基博士带你来时 我们看到了机会
And when Dr. Sinskey brought you in, we saw an opportunity.

1141
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:01,250
当时是伊丽莎白来找我的
It was Elizabeth who came to see me.

1142
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:02,600
是的
Yes.

1143
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:06,570
从布沙尔探员手上 辛斯基博士弄到了法拉第指示器
Dr. Sinskey got the Faraday pointer from agent Bouchard.

1144
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,820
她带去让你解密
She brought it to you to decode,

1145
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:11,670
甚至用你的指纹来设作密码
and she even secured it with your thumbprint.

1146
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:13,120
我们别无选择
That left us with no choice,

1147
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:15,780
所以我们在街上把你抢了过来
so we took you from her on the street.

1148
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:21,870
医院里的情况促使你相信布鲁克斯医生
The hospital scenario encouraged you to trust Dr. Brooks.

1149
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:26,410
你们给领事馆打电话时 另一头接通的是我们
When you called to the Consulate it was answered by our man.

1150
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:27,940
兰登教授
Professor Langdon?

1151
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:30,600
谢天谢地你还活着 我们一直在找你
Thank heavens you're alive. We've been looking for you.

1152
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:31,920
东西你还带着吗
Are you still in possession?

1153
01:30:31,950 --> 01:30:33,980
你带着指示器 我们跟着你
You had the pointer and we had you.

1154
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,890
一切都推进的天衣无缝 直到布鲁克斯女士把你引开
It was all working seamlessly until Miss. Brooks stole you away.

1155
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,120
以确保病毒得以释放
To make sure the virus is released.

1156
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:44,150
看来
It appears.

1157
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:47,530
年轻人很失望
Young people are disappointing.

1158
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:52,410
我发现他们35岁左右时 就挺有耐性的了
I find them become tolerable around 35.

1159
01:30:54,970 --> 01:30:57,360
你提到过辛斯基博士
You mentioed Dr. Sinskey.

1160
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:07,000
我一直很担心你
I've been so worried.

1161
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:10,300
你还好吗
Are you alright?

1162
01:31:10,330 --> 01:31:12,630
- 我很好 - 是吗
- I'm fine. - Are you?

1163
01:31:12,650 --> 01:31:14,450
我很好
I'm okay.

1164
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:16,720
挺好的
I'm alright.

1165
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:19,530
谢天谢地
Thank god.

1166
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,250
- 你知道病毒在哪儿吗 - 伊斯坦布尔
- Do you know where the virus is? - Istanbul.

1167
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:29,300
世界卫生组织专机 下午 5:32

1168
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,800
现在正是时候
Now's the time.

1169
01:31:32,270 --> 01:31:34,540
今天是重生之日
Today is rebirth.

1170
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:37,120
地狱就是救赎
Inferno is salvation.

1171
01:31:42,690 --> 01:31:45,110
我很抱歉把你卷进来 罗伯特
I am so sorry I brought you into this, Robert,

1172
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:49,620
- 在这么多年之后 - 没事 我很高兴你那么做了
- after all these years. - No. I'm glad you did.

1173
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:53,680
我见过他 佐布里斯特 两年前
I met him, you know. Zobrist, 2 years ago.

1174
01:31:53,710 --> 01:31:55,440
他当时向我求助
He asked for my help.

1175
01:31:55,460 --> 01:31:58,780
他想让WHO支持他的行动
He wanted the WHO to endorse mass sterilization

1176
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:01,420
对饮用水和主食中进行大规模杀菌消毒
in drinking waters and staple foods.

1177
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:05,590
于是我下了逐客令 把他列为监控对像
So I threw him out of my office, put him on the watch list.

1178
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,790
但他失踪了...
But he disappeared and...

1179
01:32:10,450 --> 01:32:13,990
我猜那就是他雇佣了西姆斯的时候
I suppose that's when Zobrist hired Sims.

1180
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:19,030
我早应该发... 我不知道
I should probably have... have I don't know.

1181
01:32:19,050 --> 01:32:19,810
怎么
What?

1182
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:24,300
这些都不是你的错 你总要为它们责怪自己
You always blame yourself for things that weren't your fault.

1183
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,500
嘴还是很甜
Still very sweet.

1184
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:47,190
这边 有个门口
Here, a doorway.

1185
01:32:58,670 --> 01:33:02,710
我希望见面那会 是别的事情呢
I wish it would have happened differently, back then.

1186
01:33:04,630 --> 01:33:08,550
咱们当时没有经营好 就这么散了
We didn't look after it. It fell apart.

1187
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:10,830
这算是后悔吗
Is that a regret?

1188
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:15,450
我想起来的时候才会这样
Only when I think about it.

1189
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:24,890
你知道吗 在门口那发生的最有意思的事情是
You know, the most interesting things happened in doorways,

1190
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:29,140
那样一种持续的临界状态
at the borders, right along the edges.

1191
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:36,000
古代渔民会在寒暖洋流交汇处打渔
Ancient fishermen learned to sail where the warm water met the cold.

1192
01:33:36,030 --> 01:33:40,410
小鱼会滞留在暖流边上
The little fish would reach the edge of the warm water and they stopped.

1193
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:43,350
然后大鱼就从寒流里游过来 把它们吃掉
And the big fish would come out of the cold water and they eat them.

1194
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:45,810
最后是渔民们
And the fishermen.

1195
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:48,480
嗯 渔翁得利
Well, they caught everybody.

1196
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,990
门口那儿
Doorways.

1197
01:33:57,470 --> 01:34:01,610
你还是老样子 罗伯特
Not one part of you has changed, Robert.

1198
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:07,250
话痨一个
You talk too much.

1199
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:13,570
嗯 一点也没变
And then, not at all

1200
01:34:14,390 --> 01:34:16,070
伊丽莎白
Elizabeth.

1201
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:23,380
我无法请求你别去日内瓦
I couldn't ask you not to go to Geneva.

1202
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:26,900
做不到
I couldn't.

1203
01:34:26,930 --> 01:34:30,680
我也不想让你离开剑桥市
I didn't want to ask you to leave Cambridge.

1204
01:34:36,150 --> 01:34:38,630
事情就是这么发生的吗
Was that how it happened?

1205
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:42,870
我不能再相信记忆了
I don't trust my memory anymore.

1206
01:34:43,810 --> 01:34:46,150
我从未忘记任何事情
I never forget anything.

1207
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:48,280
好吧 那是天赋
Well, that's a gift.

1208
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:51,730
不 不是的
No, it isn't.

1209
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:09,030
离他远点 嘿 嘿 你们在干嘛
Leave him alone! Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

1210
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:10,040
离他远点
Leave him alone!

1211
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:11,810
转过身去
Turn around!

1212
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:14,450
别看我 贱货 转过头去

我得抢先找到它

引爆炸弹 确保病毒被释放

这是他选中此地的原因

1232
01:37:27,270 --> 01:37:29,440
如果袋子没有破损 我们可以装住它
If the bag is intact, we can contain it.

1233
01:37:29,460 --> 01:37:32,290
但若有人先发制人 把它弄破了
But if someone ruptures it before we get there

1234
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:38,490

你有没有彻底疏散建筑内的人群
Have you completely evacuated the building?

1239
01:38:27,370 --> 01:38:30,840
我们竭尽全力了 但这地方实在太大
Well, to the extent that we can but the place is massive.

1240
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:33,600
你可以告诉我要找的东西具体是什么吗

我听到地面下有流水声
I hear water flowing under these stones.

1247
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:11,140
它流向哪儿
Where does it go?

1248
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:13,370
只是个排水道 流入到市政蓄水池里
It's just drainage. It goes to the city cistern.

1249
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:15,650
我们要找的是一个大型地下空间

内部可能有支柱和人工照明

这个怎么用

1259
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:47,580
爆炸物装在接线盒里

1261
01:39:51,070 --> 01:39:54,530
去个电话 就会引爆
A call from this cellphone will trigger the explosion.

1262
01:39:54,550 --> 01:39:56,410
这么点就能弄破袋子吗
And that's enough to break the bag?

1263
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:58,900
四面墙壁都是混凝土
The walls are cement all around.

1264
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:03,370
这俩炸弹都要装上 两个角度 尽量分开
You need both bombs, different angles, as far apart as you can.

1265
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:05,500
然后就能弄破袋子

1268
01:40:17,810 --> 01:40:22,660
它也同样精简了人口 并孕育了文艺复兴运动
is that it also produced a leaner population, and gave birth to the Renaissance.

1269
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:26,450

We are rushing as fast as we can into the seventh circle of hell.

1270
01:40:26,470 --> 01:40:28,100
自取灭亡 却又有利可图
Suicidal but profitable.

1271
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:30,820
能够短痛 何必长痛
Why is suffering later preferable to suffering now?

1272
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:35,840
倘若我们欣然接受 然后痛苦或许就能解救我们
What if we embrace it. And then maybe pain can save us.

1273
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:41,510
你听明白了 对吧 我看得出来
You're getting this, aren't you? I can see that you are.

1274
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:44,730
现在我想知道的是我并非形单影只
Now I need to know that I'm not alone.

1275
01:40:58,740 --> 01:41:00,940

还有全面隔离和控制方案
Full isolation and containment protocols.

1279
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:13,910
物理和化学屏蔽 外加... 等会
Physical and chemical barriers along with... Wait.

1280
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,060
这是城内的供水系统吗
This is the city's water supply?

1281
01:41:18,090 --> 01:41:20,150
噢 现在不是了 已经现代化改造过
Oh, not anymore. We've modernized.

1282
01:41:20,170 --> 01:41:21,320
但里面的水就留在那儿
But there is water in there.

1283
01:41:21,350 --> 01:41:23,570
是的 最终慢慢渗入地下

1284
01:41:23,590 --> 01:41:24,930
那为什么这么多人

People come from all over the world to hear it.

1288
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:37,610
他制造了一种生物气溶胶
He created a bioaerosol.

1289
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:40,110
所以可以通过空气传播
So it will spread in the air.

1290
01:41:40,130 --> 01:41:42,440
- 清空现场人群 - 不要

我们人多势众
There are too many of us down here!

1332
01:46:56,060 --> 01:46:58,370
你抢不到袋子的
You won't get to that bag before we do!

1333
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:01,470
的确 但我会确保它破掉
No. But I can make sure it breaks.

1334
01:47:01,490 --> 01:47:04,470
不 别这么做 西恩娜 不要 你会滥杀无辜
No. Don't do this, Sienna, don't. You'll be murdering innocents.

这是大自然的旨意

人口危机问题不再只会缓解 而是一劳永逸的解决了
The problem won't just be slowed down, it would be solved permanently.

1339
01:47:15,610 --> 01:47:19,750
借生灵涂炭来拯救苍生 这是暴君的逻辑
Killing billions to save lives. That's the logic of tyrants.

1340
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:23,120
- 为了更高的目标 人类... - 就算天才也不能有这种权利
- For a greater good, humanity... - Geniuses don't come with extra rights.

Then scream at the top of your lungs. An event and leave.

1344
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:35,720
如果你爱这个物种 如果你爱这个星球
If you loved humanity, if you love this planet,

1345
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:37,770
你会不惜一切去挽救它
you would do anything to save it.

1346
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:42,250
人类历史上那些极恶之罪都曾冠以爱的名义
The greatest sins in human history had been committed in the name of love.

1347
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:44,800
但没人会赞同这种看法
No one will look on this act and call it love.

1348
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:46,520
人类会延续的
They'll be alive.

1349
01:47:47,410 --> 01:47:50,000
别人如何评价 又与我何干
What does it matter what they say about us.

1350
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:54,100
无信号
No Signal

1351
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,900
嘿 你在干什么
Hey, what are you doing?

1352
01:49:35,150 --> 01:49:36,000
不可以
Don't!

1353
01:50:25,550 --> 01:50:27,610
别射着箱子
Don't shoot the box!

1354
01:50:43,650 --> 01:50:45,000
罗伯特 快闪开
Robert, get clear!

1355
01:51:02,350 --> 01:51:04,100
你还好吗 你没事吧
Are you alright? Are you alright?

1356
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:05,000
没事
Fine.

1357
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:08,000
箱子在哪 箱子在哪
Where's the box. Where's the box.

1358
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:56,000
它密封了 完好无损
It's contained, no breach.

1359
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:00,540
病毒已被完全隔离
The virus has been completely contained.

1360
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:03,040
病毒已被隔离
The virus has been contained.

1361
01:52:03,150 --> 01:52:06,040
- 医疗小组全部进场 - 我们现在接管这儿的工作
- All medical team come in . - We'll take it from now on.

1362
01:52:06,830 --> 01:52:10,000
重复一遍 目标已被隔离 准备转移
I repeat. The target is contained, be prepared for transport.

1363
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:20,100
没有泄漏 重复一遍 没有泄漏
There is no leakage. I Repeat. There is no leakage.

1364
01:53:06,150 --> 01:53:08,910
她以为她在拯救世界
She thought she was saving the world.

1365
01:53:10,610 --> 01:53:12,500
他们也是这么想的
So did they all.

1366
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:25,000
那么 接下来要做什么
So, what would happen now?

1367
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:28,900
我们会带回日内瓦做检测 把它隔离起来
We'll take it back to Geneva for test, put it in isolation.

1368
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:32,220
首先要测出基因序列
We'll have to generate another geno sequences first

1369
01:53:32,260 --> 01:53:34,350
再顺藤摸瓜 提出解决方案
to get an idea what we are dealing with.

1370
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:38,650
接下来还有很多事要忙
There's a lot of work to be done.

1371
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:46,500
你呢 回去吗
And you, Cambridge?

1372
01:53:50,110 --> 01:53:51,300
是的
Yeah.

1373
01:53:54,700 --> 01:53:56,000
辛斯基博士
Dr. Sinskey?

1374
01:54:00,450 --> 01:54:03,110
生活又要把咱分开了
Life tore us apart again.

1375
01:54:04,930 --> 01:54:07,500
就像但丁和比阿特丽斯那样
Like Dante and Beatrice.

1376
01:54:11,570 --> 01:54:13,500
我有东西要给你
I have something for you.

1377
01:54:27,330 --> 01:54:29,800
你被绑架那晚 我捡到了这个
I picked this up the night you were taken.

1378
01:54:30,130 --> 01:54:32,650
我记得它对你似乎意味非凡
I seem to remember it was important to you.

1379
01:54:37,430 --> 01:54:39,200
是的 是的没错
Yes. Yes, it is.

1380
01:54:43,650 --> 01:54:47,850
你有没有想过 你我之间
Do you ever think about what could happen

1381
01:54:47,870 --> 01:54:49,300
会发生些什么
with you and me?

1382
01:54:51,250 --> 01:54:52,500
我想过
I do.

1383
01:54:56,690 --> 01:54:59,620
我猜生活还得有点儿神秘感 教授
I guess life must have it's mysteries, Professor,

1384
01:55:00,220 --> 01:55:02,000
即便是我们俩
even for us.

1385
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,350
佛罗伦萨 意大利 某天早上 9:00

1386
01:55:36,450 --> 01:55:40,300
- 打扰一下 你会讲英语吗 - 会的
- ' Scusati, do you speak English? - Yes.

1387
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:43,310
有没有见到玛塔·阿尔瓦雷兹 那位工作人员
Have you seen Marta Alvarez, the museum staff?

1388
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:46,790
玛塔现在不在这 她怀孕了
Marta isn't here just now. She's had her baby.

1389
01:55:46,820 --> 01:55:49,400
她怀孕了 啊呀 太棒了
She had her baby? Aw, that is great.

1390
01:55:49,810 --> 01:55:51,080
好消息
Great news.

1391
01:55:51,110 --> 01:55:54,200
那么 你或许要通知某人该给但丁面具展位开灯了
Well, you might tell someone that the lights on the Dante mask

1392
01:55:54,250 --> 01:55:55,800
我几乎看不到呢
should be turned on because I can barely see it.

1393
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:59,060
我很遗憾 先生 但丁面具不在这儿
I'm sorry, sir, the Dante mask is no longer here.

1394
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:00,050
它被盗了
It was stolen.

1395
01:56:00,510 --> 01:56:02,500
- 真的吗 - 嗯 - 我刚还看着它呢
- Really? - Um - I was just looking at it.

1396
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:05,320
失陪一下
Excuse me.
