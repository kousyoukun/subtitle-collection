1
00:01:07,585 --> 00:01:09,668
She scares me so much.

2
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:12,710
Just count with me.

3
00:01:21,835 --> 00:01:25,835
VIENNA, AUSTRIA. DECEMBER 1877

4
00:01:30,918 --> 00:01:33,335
How long? - 40.

5
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:37,751
Nonsense. It was a whole minute and eleven seconds, Majesty.

6
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,585
Fetch Lotti.

7
00:02:19,876 --> 00:02:23,835
The Emperor and Empress will arrive to the last bars of the national anthem.

8
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:26,543
You leave the carriage simultaneously

9
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,876
in front of the main entrance of the new Museum of Art History.

10
00:02:30,043 --> 00:02:33,668
You will be greeted by the architect Baron von Hasenauer,

11
00:02:33,835 --> 00:02:37,251
mayor Felder and minister-president Prince of Auersperg,

12
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:39,710
who will join you in the topping-out ceremony.

13
00:02:45,168 --> 00:02:49,085
Since you haven't seen him in a while, Your Majesty will permit me to remark

14
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:53,418
that the Prince has been critical of the Double Monarchy from the very start.

15
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:57,168
He seems to keep a precise record of how many days

16
00:02:57,335 --> 00:03:00,126
Your Majesty spends on Hungarian soil.

17
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:08,418
<i>At the Emperor's side prevails</i>

18
00:03:08,585 --> 00:03:15,043
<i>He related by common sense</i>

19
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:21,751
<i>Rich in charm that never outdated</i>

20
00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:28,501
<i>Our gracious Empress</i>

21
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:35,043
<i>What fortune to be praised as highly</i>

22
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:41,710
<i>Stream from the sky on them</i>

23
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:45,293
<i>Hail Franz Joseph</i>

24
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,668
<i>Hail Elise</i>

25
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:55,460
<i>Blessing to the entire House of Habsburg</i>

26
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,418
Majesty.

27
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:03,918
Watch out for your back, Adolf.

28
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:06,960
A magnificent building. You must be proud, Carl.

29
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:11,293
As though your ink drawing came to life and made its way to the Ringstrasse.

30
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:15,793
What a rare honour, Your Majesty.

31
00:04:16,043 --> 00:04:21,210
My wife read recently in the papers that you were struggling with your weight.

32
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,668
These tabloids are a veritable plague.

33
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,460
Your Majesty, what a delight to welcome you in person.

34
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:36,001
Being appreciative of art, I know of course the depictions of your gracefulness.

35
00:04:36,168 --> 00:04:39,043
Luckily, there are plenty because here in Vienna

36
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,585
we almost think of Majesty as a phantom.

37
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:07,876
You sway back slowly and then...

38
00:06:08,043 --> 00:06:11,793
And then the eyes. At the right moment, you do this...

39
00:06:13,585 --> 00:06:15,210
Like this and then...

40
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:27,335
That did not look quite right, Ludwig. - Show me again then.

41
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:40,668
You remind me of my dogs.

42
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:44,960
I'd love to be your dog, then I wouldn't vex your husband so much.

43
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:48,251
You would. He's jealous of my dogs.

44
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:49,918
Is he? - He is.

45
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,335
But actually,

46
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:03,210
you much rather remind me of my wallpaper.

47
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,293
They were inconsolable.

48
00:07:19,126 --> 00:07:22,335
They want to assure themselves of your existence occasionally.

49
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:25,293
I really felt... so weak.

50
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,793
Those cheekbones. - He is sweet, isn't he?

51
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:41,251
Is your dear cousin staying much longer?

52
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,335
He is leaving tomorrow. He has obligations.

53
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,126
I have never met a more fickle person. - Haven't you?

54
00:07:57,085 --> 00:08:00,543
People will gossip that you are sick again.

55
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,918
Well, it does make me sick

56
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:07,418
to stand there with a kilo of tin on my head, while everybody gawks at me.

57
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:14,876
What will you do about the Serbians? What does Gyula say?

58
00:08:15,751 --> 00:08:19,335
General Beck and I have been in contact.

59
00:08:20,085 --> 00:08:23,043
Andrássy's opinion is of minor importance now.

60
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,543
As is mine.

61
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:26,876
Stop that.

62
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,668
See what Hungary has brought us? - Yes.

63
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:34,376
A kingdom.

64
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,793
I asked for your opinion back then.

65
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:43,168
And I am despised for doing so to this day.

66
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:47,710
"A lion doesn't lose sleep over the opinion of sheep."

67
00:09:17,126 --> 00:09:18,835
<i>Nobody loves nobody.</i>

68
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:23,043
<i>Everybody loves</i> <i>what he wants from others.</i>

69
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:28,210
<i>And we love anybody who loves in us that</i> <i>which we would like to be.</i>

70
00:09:58,251 --> 00:10:00,335
Let's go on a journey.

71
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,043
Majesty, it's Christmas in two days.

72
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,418
"The large assembly organised by the Independence Party

73
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:32,043
was attended by over 5,000 people.

74
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,543
Vehement speeches were held in opposition to Minister Andrássy..."

75
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:40,501
Mama, the trees are being decorated. They are the biggest ones we have ever had.

76
00:10:40,668 --> 00:10:45,585
You have to see them. - I do not care much about dead plants.

77
00:10:47,585 --> 00:10:49,918
The child looks pale.

78
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:53,335
Yes, Majesty. - You must get some fresh air.

79
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:59,043
When was she last outdoors? - I have so much studying to do, Mama.

80
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:03,376
Studying is good, but breathing is even better.

81
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:07,668
Send for Hunyady.

82
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,460
The child is reading too much in German. - Yes.

83
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:27,126
A young idealist has of course no idea

84
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:31,001
of the duties and devotion that mark the lives of the aristocracy.

85
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:34,251
But it's quite amusing to leaf through his newspaper.

86
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:36,960
I sometimes do it in secret.

87
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:40,251
It must be the audacity of youth

88
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:44,043
that gives him these republican ideas.

89
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:50,251
These newspaper people are quite infatuated with Her Majesty.

90
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,668
She is always a source of stories, your Mama, isn't she?

91
00:11:53,835 --> 00:11:56,501
More of rumours, I would say.

92
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:36,418
<i>Long may she live</i> <i>Long may she live</i>

93
00:12:36,585 --> 00:12:41,085
<i>And yet more so</i>

94
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:43,835
<i>Long may she live</i>

95
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:46,585
<i>Long may she live</i>

96
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:50,501
<i>And yet more so</i>

97
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,460
<i>Beautiful may she remain</i>

98
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:55,960
<i>Beautiful may she remain</i>

99
00:12:56,126 --> 00:13:00,543
<i>And yet more so</i>

100
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:08,626
The candles, Mama.

101
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,835
A steady breath like a 20-year-old.

102
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:32,918
Here's to you, my darling.

103
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:36,585
Happy Birthday.

104
00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:52,418
<i>At the age of 40</i> <i>a person begins to disperse and fade,</i>

105
00:13:53,085 --> 00:13:55,335
<i>darkening like a cloud.</i>

106
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:07,876
For example, we intend to place the two sections,

107
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:11,918
for peaceful and for restless patients, further apart,

108
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:15,460
so the emotional mood swings of one group

109
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:21,085
do not trigger attacks of hysteria and panic in the other.

110
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:26,543
And in line with Your Majesty's valuable remark on your last visit,

111
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,126
which put the medical staff in a flurry,

112
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:32,293
the installation of modern bathrooms is being considered.

113
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,751
Especially since the healing power of warm baths,

114
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:41,585
with various substances or even electricity added to the water,

115
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:44,876
is proving of increasing importance in this treatment.

116
00:14:54,585 --> 00:14:57,376
Hello. Candied violets.

117
00:14:58,335 --> 00:15:00,126
You will like them.

118
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:06,335
Paralytic imbecility.

119
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:09,251
Triggered by secondary syphilis.

120
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:11,501
Don't you remember me?

121
00:15:13,001 --> 00:15:15,376
Last time you told me I was beautiful.

122
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:33,210
Most of the women here are by nature melancholic.

123
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:38,835
Jesus.

124
00:15:39,626 --> 00:15:41,376
A fairy.

125
00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:46,585
Valerie.

126
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,876
Come on, get dressed.

127
00:16:57,001 --> 00:16:58,793
It's night time.

128
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,876
We are going on a little trip. Just the two of us.

129
00:17:03,043 --> 00:17:06,251
Is it allowed? - I allow it, my dearest.

130
00:17:09,168 --> 00:17:10,710
Come.

131
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:21,585
Your horse is falling asleep. - I can't see anything, Mama.

132
00:17:22,168 --> 00:17:24,543
And I'm so cold.

133
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:28,085
Darkness is beautiful. It's protection.

134
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,960
Valerie.

135
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:38,168
Valerie.

136
00:17:54,293 --> 00:17:57,335
"... saw a large fish flapping around,

137
00:17:57,501 --> 00:18:01,335
trapped in a thorn bush, unable to move.

138
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:06,751
As soon as the fish saw Sepp on his horse, it addressed him:

139
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:11,085
God bless you, please free me from this thorn bush.

140
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:15,210
I have been trapped here for seven years..."

141
00:18:17,585 --> 00:18:20,251
Over 40 degrees? - 39.

142
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:22,960
She is quite fine.

143
00:18:23,126 --> 00:18:25,001
Papa!

144
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,668
It's beyond my comprehension that you of all people would risk our child's health.

145
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:34,751
Will you always blame me?

146
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:41,376
We didn't know it better. We should never have travelled with Sophie.

147
00:18:41,543 --> 00:18:44,418
She could have fallen ill here, too. - No!  - Yes!

148
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:55,085
I don't want you to pass on your restlessness to our child.

149
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:59,043
The task of raising the children is mine alone.

150
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,251
You committed yourself on paper.

151
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,460
I do not believe that you see more in them

152
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:09,668
than their position in the succession to the throne.

153
00:19:11,335 --> 00:19:13,001
Papa!

154
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,501
Hello, princess.

155
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:28,585
She would be 22 years old now.

156
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,918
She wasn't that droll and chubby at all.

157
00:19:42,085 --> 00:19:44,585
But she did have that serious look.

158
00:19:47,668 --> 00:19:49,543
He captured that well.

159
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:57,001
At least we leave behind a pretty picture of her.

160
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,168
The room needs to be cleaned.

161
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:36,418
My husband is not joining me?

162
00:20:38,085 --> 00:20:40,918
I was ordered to serve your dinner only, Majesty.

163
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:26,251
Good evening, Your Majesty.

164
00:21:27,918 --> 00:21:29,668
Has His Majesty gone out?

165
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:34,251
No, Your Majesty. His Majesty has already gone to bed.

166
00:21:38,335 --> 00:21:40,085
Is he unwell?

167
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:46,460
His Majesty is quite well, Your Majesty.

168
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,876
You arsehole.

169
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:14,335
Forgive me for disturbing you so late. - The later the disturbance, the better.

170
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:18,751
You are leaving so suddenly. - I always go away after New Year.

171
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,418
My sister will be joining me.

172
00:22:23,585 --> 00:22:25,960
Well, Papa is surprised that you...

173
00:22:27,876 --> 00:22:31,543
Howsoever... I would like to accompany you.

174
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:36,001
Lovely.

175
00:23:14,168 --> 00:23:16,501
Now they're checking if I've grown old.

176
00:23:23,751 --> 00:23:27,835
NORTHAMPTONSHIRE, ENGLAND. JANUARY 1878

177
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:53,543
Thank you.

178
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,626
Bay will never marry Charlotte.

179
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,001
You know very well why.

180
00:25:08,668 --> 00:25:10,668
Don't you want your sherry?

181
00:25:11,918 --> 00:25:16,293
I do not see the attraction of alcohol. - It helps to relax.

182
00:25:20,835 --> 00:25:23,626
Remember father after seven tankards of beer?

183
00:25:23,793 --> 00:25:25,335
You exaggerate.

184
00:25:27,751 --> 00:25:31,335
I believed every man spoke that way after dark.

185
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:34,085
He slurred his speech after dinner.

186
00:25:41,168 --> 00:25:43,043
My sister is tired.

187
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,751
Yes, Your Highness.

188
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:58,126
Your Imperial Highness.

189
00:26:02,293 --> 00:26:05,293
You have good eyes. - Yes, I do.

190
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,376
Majesty, Mr Louis Le Prince, resident in Leeds.

191
00:26:08,543 --> 00:26:13,043
He asked to meet you. The Earl felt his request might interest you.

192
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:16,960
You have a request? - Your Majesty.

193
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:21,585
It is said that your interest in technical innovation is unusual for a woman.

194
00:26:22,418 --> 00:26:27,085
And what I have to present is indeed an exciting new invention.

195
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:32,251
But you don't appear excited. - No. I am even-tempered by disposition.

196
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:39,501
I would like to film you, Majesty.

197
00:26:41,001 --> 00:26:42,918
What would you like?

198
00:26:44,751 --> 00:26:49,376
I have developed an apparatus that can capture moving pictures.

199
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:53,335
Like photography?

200
00:26:53,501 --> 00:26:58,168
The difference is that photographs don't move.

201
00:27:01,626 --> 00:27:04,001
I don't think much of photographs.

202
00:27:04,585 --> 00:27:09,085
They claim to be objective. But nothing is ever objective.

203
00:27:09,251 --> 00:27:10,793
Well...

204
00:27:11,626 --> 00:27:15,793
the accounts of your beauty and your grace are not objective either.

205
00:27:17,085 --> 00:27:19,543
But I can now tell that they are true.

206
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,543
Come back tomorrow.

207
00:27:26,668 --> 00:27:28,626
All right. Thank you.

208
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,960
Goodnight. - Goodnight.

209
00:27:56,376 --> 00:27:58,960
Monsieur, can your device hear me?

210
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:01,876
What a wonderful idea.

211
00:28:02,668 --> 00:28:04,251
But no, alas.

212
00:28:05,835 --> 00:28:07,168
No.

213
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,126
So I can say anything I wish as long as I smile?

214
00:28:11,293 --> 00:28:14,168
Yes, Madam. You just say whatever you wish.

215
00:28:14,335 --> 00:28:16,376
Say whatever you want.

216
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,960
What does your father say about this?

217
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:16,085
He allows her to do as she wishes.

218
00:30:16,793 --> 00:30:20,168
But he is naturally concerned.

219
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,710
All by yourself today?

220
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:04,751
Not any longer. Come, let's ride together to the other end of the forest.

221
00:31:07,168 --> 00:31:09,001
I am not in the mood.

222
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:14,043
I need to talk to you, Mama.

223
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:20,210
You are too close to your riding instructor.

224
00:31:20,876 --> 00:31:24,376
Bay is not my instructor. I ride just as well as him.

225
00:31:24,543 --> 00:31:28,918
People talk about you. And I don't want Papa to hear what they say.

226
00:31:32,543 --> 00:31:36,668
If you're bothered by gossip, you're hardly cut out to be Emperor.

227
00:31:41,751 --> 00:31:44,460
You should maintain more distance to him.

228
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:47,335
It's not fitting.

229
00:31:47,918 --> 00:31:50,835
I shall not allow my children to tell me what is fitting.

230
00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:54,751
With all due respect, Mama, you are the one acting like a child.

231
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:59,876
You abandon yourself to every whim, without considering your position.

232
00:37:06,793 --> 00:37:10,126
It's a miracle that you are unharmed. - Why?

233
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:17,168
Why can't I be dead instead of my horse? - It's sacrilege to talk like this.

234
00:37:18,835 --> 00:37:23,126
He was the most intelligent and the strongest horse.

235
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:30,418
Bay will find you another horse. - I don't want another horse! I want mine!

236
00:37:35,585 --> 00:37:37,501
And I shall never see Bay again.

237
00:37:39,376 --> 00:37:40,835
Why?

238
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:45,043
Some gossip has imputed an affair to us and set my son against me.

239
00:38:03,376 --> 00:38:05,960
I never want to see my sister again.

240
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:09,543
A little milk?

241
00:38:36,001 --> 00:38:38,168
We shall help you with this.

242
00:38:38,335 --> 00:38:41,085
You are back. - Yes.

243
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:44,335
VIENNA, AUSTRIA. MARCH 1878

244
00:38:44,585 --> 00:38:46,626
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

245
00:38:48,376 --> 00:38:51,668
I am busy after this. I shall come and see you later.

246
00:38:53,626 --> 00:38:57,835
Mr Blümlinger, we will find a solution for your family.

247
00:38:58,001 --> 00:39:02,376
Your wife shall not be forced to become a washerwoman. We feel for you.

248
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:23,543
You must be very tired after the exhausting journey.

249
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,793
I was told about your fall.

250
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:36,876
Good to see that you are unharmed.

251
00:39:41,043 --> 00:39:42,626
Come over here now.

252
00:39:56,085 --> 00:39:58,418
You can stop being angry with me.

253
00:40:51,668 --> 00:40:54,001
I am too old for another child.

254
00:42:12,876 --> 00:42:14,626
Look at me.

255
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:21,210
Don't stop looking at me.

256
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:44,876
Ida, darling. Nobody is watching, so you could try it today.

257
00:42:45,043 --> 00:42:46,793
No, thank you, my dear.

258
00:42:47,418 --> 00:42:49,126
I order you.

259
00:42:49,876 --> 00:42:52,918
Come. There is no finer place in the whole world.

260
00:42:53,585 --> 00:42:55,043
No. - Help her mount.

261
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,960
No, really. - Yes.

262
00:42:57,876 --> 00:43:00,335
Good. Hold on tight.

263
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:08,085
Your dress.

264
00:43:10,626 --> 00:43:12,626
One, two, three.

265
00:43:16,168 --> 00:43:17,251
Okay.

266
00:43:17,501 --> 00:43:20,793
I am holding you. Okay? - Okay.

267
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,626
Don't be afraid.

268
00:43:24,043 --> 00:43:25,876
It's a docile horse.

269
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,293
Continue. Faster.

270
00:44:13,001 --> 00:44:14,585
Attack.

271
00:44:15,626 --> 00:44:17,626
Now! Now!

272
00:44:17,793 --> 00:44:19,668
And... allez!

273
00:44:20,835 --> 00:44:22,668
Bend your knees.

274
00:44:24,418 --> 00:44:26,085
Move forward.

275
00:44:26,251 --> 00:44:27,668
And back.

276
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:29,960
Two steps forward.

277
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,710
Two steps back.

278
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,960
One step.

279
00:44:35,126 --> 00:44:36,668
Lunge.

280
00:44:37,501 --> 00:44:40,043
Anna Nahowski, née Nowak.

281
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,835
Resident of Schönbrunner Strasse 8. 18 years old.

282
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:48,918
Married to Franz Nahowski, her second husband. An official of the South Railways.

283
00:44:49,585 --> 00:44:51,876
18 years old?

284
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:57,460
Her first marriage to the silk manufacturer Johann Heuduck

285
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,585
was arranged by her parents.

286
00:44:59,751 --> 00:45:02,751
Heuduck indulged in alcohol and was addicted to gambling.

287
00:45:03,251 --> 00:45:06,210
And he was unable to get her pregnant.

288
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:09,418
They say she copies your hairstyle.

289
00:45:10,835 --> 00:45:14,876
She is young. That counts more than a nice hairstyle.

290
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:18,668
Her second marriage is also grounded on financial reasons.

291
00:45:18,918 --> 00:45:21,668
It seems she is longing for romance now.

292
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:26,626
As if she could find that with FJ.

293
00:45:32,335 --> 00:45:35,251
Hanni, lend me a dress.

294
00:45:38,751 --> 00:45:40,835
Majesty, I am Fini.

295
00:45:44,835 --> 00:45:46,876
Well, Fini then.

296
00:45:48,085 --> 00:45:50,751
And a few mushrooms. Not too many.

297
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:52,960
I'll get some meat.

298
00:45:56,001 --> 00:46:00,001
Hello. How is your husband? - He's very busy.

299
00:46:00,168 --> 00:46:02,835
I want some of this. - How much would you like?

300
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:07,418
Is it tender? It has to be tender. - Very tender, Madam. See for yourself.

301
00:46:07,585 --> 00:46:11,376
Let me try. - Of course, Madam.

302
00:46:16,335 --> 00:46:17,960
Exquisite.

303
00:46:18,126 --> 00:46:20,835
You should take it. Your husband will like it.

304
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:25,626
Thank you. Okay. Two servings.

305
00:46:27,626 --> 00:46:30,918
Advice from an experienced woman is very precious.

306
00:46:47,418 --> 00:46:50,376
Your complexion has changed, Majesty.

307
00:46:51,668 --> 00:46:53,960
I have been out in the fresh air a lot.

308
00:46:54,543 --> 00:46:56,835
No, that's not what I mean.

309
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:04,460
No worries, I won't look. I want to be surprised.

310
00:47:04,626 --> 00:47:07,293
That's wonderful after so many years of marriage.

311
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,876
Good morning, my darling.

312
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:14,793
Have you been smoking, Fini?

313
00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:17,793
This is Hanni.

314
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,876
No, my darling. This is Fini. Hanni is skinnier.

315
00:47:22,043 --> 00:47:23,668
Am I right, Fini?

316
00:47:26,168 --> 00:47:30,751
We're dining with Latour and Rudolf. He is leaving for Prague early in the morning.

317
00:47:30,918 --> 00:47:34,376
We will keep it short, as his mind will already be on his journey.

318
00:47:35,251 --> 00:47:38,460
Right. Carry on and enjoy yourself. Bye.

319
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:26,001
Have you heard of the technique of moving pictures?

320
00:48:26,168 --> 00:48:28,460
No, Majesty, I'm afraid I haven't.

321
00:48:29,543 --> 00:48:31,710
It will replace painting.

322
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:34,668
I hope not, Majesty.

323
00:48:36,585 --> 00:48:40,501
Have them bring you all my portraits hanging around the house,

324
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,210
and copy them.

325
00:48:44,626 --> 00:48:46,751
And be careful with my complexion.

326
00:48:54,418 --> 00:48:57,251
The academy in Prague is tightly organised.

327
00:48:57,418 --> 00:49:00,543
And I know all the gentlemen there, of course.

328
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:05,793
I assure you, Your Majesty, I will keep an eye on Rudolf.

329
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,543
I am confident

330
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:11,918
the best place for the Crown Prince's military education has been found.

331
00:49:12,085 --> 00:49:14,626
You know my views: Discipline is essential.

332
00:49:14,793 --> 00:49:16,793
But curiosity is more important.

333
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,710
So go through life with your eyes wide open.

334
00:49:20,501 --> 00:49:24,043
You are young and Prague is a pretty city.

335
00:49:24,793 --> 00:49:27,293
Gather experience, get to know the people.

336
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:31,793
Well, well, Mr Teacher. I hope you are not referring to the young girls!

337
00:49:43,918 --> 00:49:45,543
Here's to Prague.

338
00:49:49,335 --> 00:49:50,668
Cheers, Father.

339
00:50:28,585 --> 00:50:31,251
It breaks my heart that you're leaving.

340
00:50:35,251 --> 00:50:37,460
I'm doing my duty, Mama.

341
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,543
Don't let Papa hurt you.

342
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:48,835
I once gave you that advice.

343
00:50:49,001 --> 00:50:52,876
Did you? I think you can use it yourself, too.

344
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:58,501
Papa has his own idea of us.

345
00:51:00,085 --> 00:51:02,918
And he cannot accept any other idea.

346
00:51:56,501 --> 00:51:58,043
Tighter.

347
00:52:00,668 --> 00:52:04,918
Tighter, I said. Don't you have any strength in your hands?

348
00:52:05,085 --> 00:52:08,293
The horoscope says it's going to be a lovely day.

349
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,835
What do I care? Ida!

350
00:52:11,918 --> 00:52:13,335
Ida!

351
00:52:14,543 --> 00:52:17,085
Majesty? - I don't understand.

352
00:52:17,251 --> 00:52:21,085
They travel to the North Pole now, but it's still impossible to find girls

353
00:52:21,251 --> 00:52:25,626
who master their simple duties without ruining my day with their ugly visages.

354
00:52:25,793 --> 00:52:27,876
She gives her best, Majesty.

355
00:52:28,126 --> 00:52:30,001
Well, that's not enough.

356
00:52:37,668 --> 00:52:39,210
Tighter.

357
00:53:01,876 --> 00:53:03,668
Don't laugh at me.

358
00:53:04,543 --> 00:53:08,876
You know exactly that I am stronger. - The plan was to cheer you up.

359
00:53:11,085 --> 00:53:15,085
Then you would have to send me on a very long journey.

360
00:53:15,251 --> 00:53:16,918
It's most odd.

361
00:53:19,001 --> 00:53:22,085
You miss him here, but you never want to be here yourself.

362
00:53:22,293 --> 00:53:26,460
You would feel the same if your only duty was having your hair braided.

363
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,460
If you feel like leaving, I won't hold you back.

364
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,626
I am very busy, anyway.

365
00:53:37,085 --> 00:53:39,626
You shouldn't be working so much.

366
00:53:39,793 --> 00:53:43,376
You should go for a stroll every now and then.

367
00:53:44,126 --> 00:53:46,960
Schönbrunn is quite pretty in the spring.

368
00:54:04,293 --> 00:54:06,626
Your new portrait is quite lovely.

369
00:54:07,126 --> 00:54:10,418
I wonder how you managed to look like a young girl.

370
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:18,460
It will remind me of you when you're gone.

371
00:54:21,585 --> 00:54:24,626
I'm taking Valerie with me. - I don't know.

372
00:54:25,501 --> 00:54:27,876
Unlike you, she enjoys being at home.

373
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:33,085
Valerie's home is Hungary. - You are projecting, mon coeur.

374
00:54:33,251 --> 00:54:35,001
Leave her here.

375
00:56:05,043 --> 00:56:06,835
Look.

376
00:56:07,001 --> 00:56:08,626
You see?

377
00:56:08,793 --> 00:56:13,376
A series of successive pictures that produce the illusion of movement.

378
00:56:18,418 --> 00:56:20,918
People will love your invention.

379
00:56:21,585 --> 00:56:24,001
I don't know. So far...

380
00:56:25,251 --> 00:56:27,376
... everybody just laughs at me.

381
00:56:29,043 --> 00:56:30,710
Really?

382
00:56:30,876 --> 00:56:33,376
People fear the ephemeral.

383
00:56:34,126 --> 00:56:36,710
A beat of an eyelash, and life has passed by.

384
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,835
They would do anything to hold on to it. Isn't that so?

385
00:56:43,585 --> 00:56:45,668
Are you different?

386
00:56:46,793 --> 00:56:49,126
Yes. - How?

387
00:56:50,585 --> 00:56:54,126
I have nothing to hold on to.

388
00:56:54,293 --> 00:56:56,043
Except myself.

389
00:56:57,626 --> 00:57:00,835
And sometimes even that seems like

390
00:57:02,126 --> 00:57:04,251
an incredible effort.

391
00:57:10,918 --> 00:57:14,210
He didn't want to see her. He just sent the doctor.

392
00:57:21,418 --> 00:57:27,460
A hairline fracture of the right calf bone. You truly have a guardian angel, Majesty.

393
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:36,793
Consider your health a gift from God to be cherished, Majesty.

394
00:57:48,043 --> 00:57:52,251
BAVARIA. MAY 1878

395
00:57:57,543 --> 00:57:59,918
I had resolved to die.

396
00:58:00,085 --> 00:58:02,626
I just didn't have sufficient expertise.

397
00:58:04,918 --> 00:58:07,126
Stay as long as you like.

398
00:58:10,085 --> 00:58:12,085
Maybe forever, then.

399
00:58:13,918 --> 00:58:16,001
Won't that be too long for you?

400
00:58:18,626 --> 00:58:20,376
It's not that long.

401
01:01:24,918 --> 01:01:28,376
Bring me an orange. Sliced wafer-thin.

402
01:01:28,543 --> 01:01:30,710
What an idea. The same for me.

403
01:01:30,876 --> 01:01:35,085
And bring a little pot of melted chocolate and a bowl of whipped cream.

404
01:01:35,335 --> 01:01:36,418
Very well, Majesty.

405
01:01:36,585 --> 01:01:40,835
For all I care, we could have four desserts. The rest doesn't interest me.

406
01:01:41,085 --> 01:01:46,001
You should enjoy your trophies, Majesty. You shot more than all the men together.

407
01:01:46,918 --> 01:01:50,460
And it would be good for you, if I may be so bold.

408
01:01:51,293 --> 01:01:54,918
You are even slimmer than in the portraits. - Am I?

409
01:01:56,501 --> 01:02:01,543
All this is to turn us into beetles, lying on our backs and kicking our legs.

410
01:02:01,793 --> 01:02:04,168
But the ability to enjoy

411
01:02:04,418 --> 01:02:08,918
is an achievement of human civilisation, Your Imperial Highness.

412
01:02:09,085 --> 01:02:13,418
Or to put it another way, what poor creatures would we be

413
01:02:13,585 --> 01:02:18,668
without the delights of a good wine and its wonderfully relaxing effects?

414
01:02:18,918 --> 01:02:22,543
It would be unfitting to consider lust in the same manner,

415
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:24,460
Your Imperial Highness.

416
01:02:26,835 --> 01:02:29,710
So please allow me a little drunkenness.

417
01:02:31,668 --> 01:02:33,418
I envy you.

418
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,418
I really do.

419
01:03:04,668 --> 01:03:06,293
Open your mouth.

420
01:03:29,751 --> 01:03:31,668
Isn't it comforting?

421
01:05:01,751 --> 01:05:03,668
Forgive me, cousin.

422
01:05:30,335 --> 01:05:34,668
We are one, my dearest. The animal instincts could never compete with that.

423
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:42,585
So the rumours about the stable boys are true.

424
01:05:44,918 --> 01:05:46,668
I love you.

425
01:05:48,293 --> 01:05:50,126
But you don't want me.

426
01:05:50,835 --> 01:05:52,710
You don't want me either.

427
01:06:06,418 --> 01:06:09,918
Quite beautiful, this double-headed eagle. - Indeed.

428
01:06:10,085 --> 01:06:13,668
But I find it a little bit eerie. - You have many of them in Austria.

429
01:06:14,543 --> 01:06:17,960
The manor stretches across the hills over there.

430
01:06:19,543 --> 01:06:22,876
How do you like our region, Countess Festetics?

431
01:06:23,043 --> 01:06:25,043
Or may I say Marie?

432
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:27,626
I like it here. It's very pretty.

433
01:06:27,793 --> 01:06:29,043
Is it? - Yes.

434
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:32,126
Would your mistress mind if I called you Marie?

435
01:06:33,585 --> 01:06:35,251
Most likely.

436
01:06:57,043 --> 01:06:58,835
You look unwell.

437
01:06:59,835 --> 01:07:01,751
You should eat something.

438
01:07:02,793 --> 01:07:05,793
I hadn't expected such banality from you.

439
01:07:15,418 --> 01:07:19,001
Forgive me. I have passed on my lunatism to you.

440
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:22,460
It's not your lunatism. I haven't been sleeping for quite some time.

441
01:07:40,751 --> 01:07:43,918
Do you want me to leave? - No. On the contrary.

442
01:07:47,251 --> 01:07:50,251
But please put that death wish out of your mind.

443
01:07:51,043 --> 01:07:53,168
I thought I could share that with you.

444
01:07:57,001 --> 01:08:00,126
I forbid you to drown in my lake.

445
01:08:01,668 --> 01:08:03,418
It's my lake.

446
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:11,168
I prefer the sea anyway.

447
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,918
Count von Holnstein proposed to me.

448
01:08:59,251 --> 01:09:01,543
I know you consider him coarse.

449
01:09:03,793 --> 01:09:06,251
But he is a good-looking and smart man.

450
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:10,043
With considerable influence and wealth.

451
01:09:11,335 --> 01:09:13,085
And he is from Bavaria.

452
01:09:19,876 --> 01:09:22,668
It's most likely my last opportunity, Elisabeth.

453
01:09:29,751 --> 01:09:31,626
By no means.

454
01:09:55,751 --> 01:09:58,251
You are the only one who loves me the way I am.

455
01:10:23,668 --> 01:10:27,376
VIENNA, AUSTRIA. JULY 1878

456
01:11:13,543 --> 01:11:17,918
Come here. My darlings. Hello.

457
01:11:24,168 --> 01:11:26,085
Hello, my darlings.

458
01:11:30,876 --> 01:11:32,501
Come here.

459
01:11:39,751 --> 01:11:42,960
My dearest darling.

460
01:11:47,376 --> 01:11:49,251
We were concerned.

461
01:11:51,376 --> 01:11:54,751
Papa says you can't even look after yourself.

462
01:12:49,251 --> 01:12:51,251
<i>She is like a book to me.</i>

463
01:12:52,793 --> 01:12:55,418
<i>A riddle on each page.</i>

464
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:04,085
<i>Her soul is like a chaotic museum.</i>

465
01:13:06,335 --> 01:13:09,126
<i>Full of treasures</i> <i>that cannot be exploited.</i>

466
01:13:10,418 --> 01:13:12,918
<i>She doesn't know</i> <i>what to do with all that.</i>

467
01:13:20,793 --> 01:13:25,835
<i>She lives in a different world,</i> <i>where she is walking a path</i>

468
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:30,585
<i>so narrow</i> <i>that only one person can walk it.</i>

469
01:14:08,668 --> 01:14:12,501
The summer is unbearable. Does the humid air bother you too?

470
01:14:13,293 --> 01:14:16,626
Someone should invent a machine that turns the heat into cool air.

471
01:14:16,793 --> 01:14:20,126
Like an oven, but the other way around. Wouldn't that be marvellous?

472
01:14:20,293 --> 01:14:23,668
With all due respect, Highness, an astounding idea.

473
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:26,418
I heard there are even women who invent things.

474
01:14:26,585 --> 01:14:28,043
Of course.

475
01:14:34,543 --> 01:14:38,126
You don't wish to put to bed the old rumour about you and Andrássy.

476
01:14:41,293 --> 01:14:43,876
I simply wish I was allowed to talk as well.

477
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,710
Do you follow Sarajevo? - Of course.

478
01:14:51,543 --> 01:14:55,001
But when I look around here, everything seems unchanged.

479
01:14:55,251 --> 01:14:58,668
Crayfish, champagne and conversations about the weather.

480
01:15:01,418 --> 01:15:03,543
The monarchy is in decline.

481
01:15:08,585 --> 01:15:11,168
Don't let your father hear that.

482
01:15:12,668 --> 01:15:16,210
He knows what I think. And he blames you for it.

483
01:15:17,335 --> 01:15:21,585
Your father believes God puts everyone in the place He considers right for them.

484
01:15:23,251 --> 01:15:25,835
God certainly made a mistake with me.

485
01:15:32,835 --> 01:15:34,085
With me, too.

486
01:16:32,335 --> 01:16:34,751
It's very early for a conversation.

487
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:40,001
I am told that you don't sleep anyway.

488
01:16:41,543 --> 01:16:43,501
What is so urgent?

489
01:16:45,126 --> 01:16:48,960
It's my duty to control the fate of our Empire.

490
01:16:49,126 --> 01:16:52,001
Your duty is merely to represent.

491
01:16:53,585 --> 01:16:56,793
That's what I chose you for, that's what you're here for.

492
01:17:04,793 --> 01:17:10,126
You liked it as long as you enjoyed the beautiful clothes and the admiration.

493
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:14,585
But pleasure has no role to play in the tasks assigned to us.

494
01:17:16,751 --> 01:17:18,751
I was really tired.

495
01:17:25,501 --> 01:17:29,376
Von Widerhofer will be in your chambers at 8 o'clock to examine you.

496
01:17:29,543 --> 01:17:33,543
Never forget, no matter if bronchitis or head-ache,

497
01:17:35,043 --> 01:17:36,918
you are the Empress.

498
01:18:11,418 --> 01:18:13,835
I'm sorry that you are suffering.

499
01:18:18,835 --> 01:18:21,335
I don't know what to say, Majesty.

500
01:18:22,876 --> 01:18:25,376
I would kill for a cigarette.

501
01:18:59,168 --> 01:19:00,960
Make way, please.

502
01:19:40,918 --> 01:19:44,585
FJ sits at his desk all day and complains about the load of work.

503
01:19:44,751 --> 01:19:47,293
But no word about the thousands of wounded.

504
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:49,626
Get me the numbers, please.

505
01:19:54,043 --> 01:19:58,168
My dearest darling, you shouldn't have seen that.

506
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,751
We'll have Demel send up something.

507
01:20:03,751 --> 01:20:06,210
Do you still like their cream cake?

508
01:20:06,376 --> 01:20:08,460
Mama, smoking is unfitting.

509
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:13,043
You embarrassed me.

510
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:19,751
How can you think of cream cake now?

511
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:28,210
Thank you.

512
01:20:42,876 --> 01:20:45,460
Gyula and you underestimated the occupation.

513
01:20:45,626 --> 01:20:47,085
Well...

514
01:20:48,293 --> 01:20:51,126
It was very nice of you to visit the wounded.

515
01:20:55,626 --> 01:20:59,251
Is there anything I can do? - You have already done a great deal.

516
01:21:00,668 --> 01:21:04,668
It means a lot to soldiers if one shows interest in their fate.

517
01:21:08,085 --> 01:21:09,543
Yes.

518
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:13,751
Confide in me.

519
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:18,543
What are your plans for Sarajevo?

520
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:25,501
I have the impression, the situation there is still unsteady...

521
01:21:25,668 --> 01:21:27,168
Enough!

522
01:21:32,543 --> 01:21:35,085
You see what Hungary has brought us.

523
01:21:37,751 --> 01:21:39,168
Well, a kingdom.

524
01:21:39,335 --> 01:21:43,001
Well, this conversation doesn't get any better by repetition.

525
01:21:54,626 --> 01:21:56,335
Do you have a wish?

526
01:21:57,293 --> 01:21:59,293
Mon coeur? Anything at all.

527
01:22:04,876 --> 01:22:09,085
Allow me to bring you some joy. Just tell me what you want.

528
01:22:23,251 --> 01:22:25,293
A Bengal tiger.

529
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:29,585
Or an extension to the lunatic asylum.

530
01:22:31,168 --> 01:22:33,376
You have ample choice now.

531
01:22:42,793 --> 01:22:46,210
Your Majesty, what a surprise!

532
01:22:49,751 --> 01:22:51,751
I like it here with the women.

533
01:23:02,793 --> 01:23:04,835
Have the bathtubs arrived yet?

534
01:23:08,585 --> 01:23:11,710
What's wrong with her? - Adultery, Majesty.

535
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:16,126
She seems harmless, but she is a real hussy.

536
01:23:17,793 --> 01:23:23,668
The warm baths have a temperature of approximately 32 degrees centigrade.

537
01:23:23,835 --> 01:23:26,626
They are applied for up to 25 minutes

538
01:23:26,793 --> 01:23:30,043
and are indicated for all forms of mental agitation.

539
01:23:30,293 --> 01:23:34,585
They have a powerful soothing effect on the entire organism.

540
01:23:39,918 --> 01:23:43,543
She looks as though she wants to weep but can't.

541
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:47,793
Very well observed, Your Imperial Highness.

542
01:23:49,543 --> 01:23:51,626
Did something bad happen to her?

543
01:23:52,876 --> 01:23:56,585
One of her children died. But she has three others.

544
01:23:56,751 --> 01:23:59,668
Too bad that she can't find consolation in them.

545
01:24:37,043 --> 01:24:40,585
What is this? - It's called heroin.

546
01:24:40,751 --> 01:24:45,001
A semi-synthetic opioid. An absolute novelty on the market.

547
01:24:46,626 --> 01:24:49,793
It suppresses pain and has a soothing effect.

548
01:24:52,168 --> 01:24:55,460
I have no pain. - It could do you good.

549
01:24:56,251 --> 01:24:58,668
It's absolutely harmless.

550
01:24:58,835 --> 01:25:03,335
In the interest of your health, may I advise you to take care of yourself.

551
01:25:04,168 --> 01:25:05,960
At the age of 40...

552
01:25:11,043 --> 01:25:12,918
I may remind you

553
01:25:13,085 --> 01:25:17,376
that 40 is the average life expectancy of your female subjects.

554
01:25:33,376 --> 01:25:37,460
SUMMER RESIDENCE OF THE EMPRESS. AUGUST 1878

555
01:25:59,585 --> 01:26:01,460
Very well. Again.

556
01:26:19,418 --> 01:26:20,918
Press here.

557
01:26:36,376 --> 01:26:37,960
Marie.

558
01:26:39,501 --> 01:26:43,668
You shouldn't have dinner this evening.

559
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:48,668
You're serious about it.

560
01:26:50,251 --> 01:26:52,751
You have already given me your life.

561
01:26:56,001 --> 01:26:57,626
Marie.

562
01:27:08,751 --> 01:27:13,210
<i>At the Emperor's side prevails</i>

563
01:27:13,376 --> 01:27:18,001
<i>He related by common sense</i>

564
01:27:18,168 --> 01:27:22,543
<i>Rich in charm that never outdated</i>

565
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:27,585
<i>Our gracious Empress</i>

566
01:27:29,293 --> 01:27:31,918
Mama is very serious today, isn't she?

567
01:27:32,835 --> 01:27:35,001
She misses the Emperor, Princess.

568
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:38,001
He has never been absent on his birthday before.

569
01:28:12,251 --> 01:28:14,001
Fini!

570
01:28:14,168 --> 01:28:15,626
Come!

571
01:28:19,251 --> 01:28:21,793
Quick. We have to unlace the corsage.

572
01:28:23,626 --> 01:28:26,376
Take this off. - It's all right.

573
01:28:27,918 --> 01:28:31,168
I'm sorry. - Fini, come!

574
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:35,043
Quick.

575
01:28:36,668 --> 01:28:38,668
Help me... - I'm sorry.

576
01:28:41,001 --> 01:28:44,460
Everything's fine. Fini, open the front.

577
01:28:56,168 --> 01:28:59,085
They will say I have put on weight.

578
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:02,710
But they probably will have liked it.

579
01:32:22,751 --> 01:32:25,668
You're getting it tangled. Give it to me.

580
01:32:32,876 --> 01:32:35,835
I've been wondering for years why you put up with this.

581
01:32:36,001 --> 01:32:40,585
Ida, you have to weigh me. I feel weightless all of a sudden.

582
01:32:41,376 --> 01:32:45,335
First, this must go to the wig-maker in Vienna as quickly as possible.

583
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:51,793
Fanny, pull yourself together.

584
01:32:53,876 --> 01:32:55,835
This was my life's work.

585
01:32:56,626 --> 01:32:58,876
Well, now you have completed it.

586
01:33:14,501 --> 01:33:18,460
What touching devotion. She has set her heart on your hair.

587
01:33:19,251 --> 01:33:22,418
She is foolish, but she had the patience of an angel with you.

588
01:33:22,585 --> 01:33:23,960
No!

589
01:33:24,585 --> 01:33:26,043
None for you.

590
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:29,251
Three orange days a week.

591
01:33:29,418 --> 01:33:33,793
Clear beef broth in the evenings. Lean meat, if you want. Nothing more.

592
01:33:34,043 --> 01:33:38,043
No potatoes, no bread, no dumplings. And no pastry, for God's sake.

593
01:33:46,335 --> 01:33:47,835
Mama?

594
01:33:49,335 --> 01:33:51,251
Come in, darling.

595
01:33:58,376 --> 01:34:00,960
Forgive me, Mama.

596
01:34:01,126 --> 01:34:02,793
It's all right.

597
01:34:12,793 --> 01:34:15,418
Mama, I feel like crying.

598
01:34:15,585 --> 01:34:17,835
But that would be bad manners.

599
01:34:24,668 --> 01:34:26,251
But Mama!

600
01:34:28,043 --> 01:34:30,168
Let me hold you.

601
01:34:31,251 --> 01:34:33,626
Just one last time like my little chick.

602
01:36:45,001 --> 01:36:47,501
It's as though a part of you has died.

603
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:21,793
Stay.

604
01:38:29,793 --> 01:38:33,001
What an honour to be invited for coffee with Your Majesty.

605
01:38:34,418 --> 01:38:38,501
VIENNA, AUSTRIA. SEPTEMBER 1878

606
01:38:41,335 --> 01:38:42,876
You know the Emperor.

607
01:38:45,085 --> 01:38:47,043
It's funny.

608
01:38:47,210 --> 01:38:51,793
When I met him, I thought he was just a simple soldier who had lost his way.

609
01:38:53,876 --> 01:38:56,710
I want you to be his mistress.

610
01:39:02,751 --> 01:39:05,085
May I have some sugar?

611
01:39:08,210 --> 01:39:10,710
According to my information,

612
01:39:10,876 --> 01:39:14,835
your husband is hardly ever home during the week.

613
01:39:17,335 --> 01:39:20,668
So you will receive the Emperor regularly.

614
01:39:22,210 --> 01:39:23,668
He...

615
01:39:23,835 --> 01:39:27,376
has little time and no patience.

616
01:39:32,543 --> 01:39:35,418
Expect him in your bed, without your corsage.

617
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:40,960
And...

618
01:39:41,126 --> 01:39:43,210
talk to him.

619
01:39:44,335 --> 01:39:46,418
Just be kind to him.

620
01:39:47,543 --> 01:39:49,751
It's a matter close to my heart.

621
01:39:52,085 --> 01:39:54,085
You like him, don't you?

622
01:39:57,918 --> 01:40:00,626
The day I met him was probably...

623
01:40:02,501 --> 01:40:04,293
... the happiest day in my life.

624
01:40:07,376 --> 01:40:09,460
We have an agreement then.

625
01:40:10,668 --> 01:40:13,085
It will not be to your disadvantage.

626
01:40:59,376 --> 01:41:01,043
55.9.

627
01:41:35,501 --> 01:41:37,668
What a surprise, my darling.

628
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:43,626
Would you like to eat cream cake with me? Would you like a hot chocolate?

629
01:41:45,210 --> 01:41:47,710
I have drawn something for you, Mama.

630
01:41:49,793 --> 01:41:52,001
You were very dignified that day.

631
01:41:57,043 --> 01:41:59,543
Minny says you are leaving tomorrow?

632
01:42:02,585 --> 01:42:04,460
Yes.

633
01:42:04,626 --> 01:42:07,668
Then you should have an early night. Adieu.

634
01:42:35,751 --> 01:42:39,626
We can also wait until morning. - Let's go.

635
01:44:17,293 --> 01:44:21,001
ANCONA, ITALY. OCTOBER 1878

636
01:45:24,168 --> 01:45:28,751
Your Majesty, I must urge you to go under deck.

637
01:45:29,001 --> 01:45:31,585
The wind is getting stronger.

638
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:34,918
In a minute, signore.
