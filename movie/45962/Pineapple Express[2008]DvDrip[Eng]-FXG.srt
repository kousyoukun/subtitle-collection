00:01:27,292 --> 00:01:28,316
Private MiIIer...

00:01:28,493 --> 00:01:31,519
...you've been smoking Item 9
for seven minutes and 1 3 seconds.

3
00:01:31,697 --> 00:01:33,631
We're going to ask you
severaI questions.

00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,823
How do you feeI?

5
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:37,233
WeII, sir...

6
00:01:37,402 --> 00:01:39,131
...I feeI Iike a....

7
00:01:40,038 --> 00:01:42,370
Like a sIice of butter...

8
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:48,945
...meIting on top
of a big oId piIe of fIapjacks.

9
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,574
Yeah.

10
00:01:53,018 --> 00:01:56,112
Okay, Private MiIIer,
when you think of your superiors...

11
00:01:56,722 --> 00:01:59,156
...what emotions do you feeI?

12
00:02:06,098 --> 00:02:07,827
Okay, Private MiIIer?

13
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,494
Is this normaI?

14
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:14,332
Okay, Private--

15
00:02:15,407 --> 00:02:17,272
Okay, Private MiIIer?

16
00:02:17,442 --> 00:02:19,034
Private MiIIer.

17
00:02:22,514 --> 00:02:24,072
Answer the question.

18
00:02:30,255 --> 00:02:31,381
This went out, sir.

19
00:02:31,556 --> 00:02:34,218
Can you torch me?

20
00:02:34,393 --> 00:02:35,985
We'II send someone in.

21
00:02:37,195 --> 00:02:39,322
HoIy bejesus!

22
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,871
Private MiIIer, answer the question.

23
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,598
What was the question again, sir?

24
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:54,206
When you think of your superiors,
what emotions do you feeI?

25
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:56,138
You know what probIem I have...

26
00:02:56,314 --> 00:02:59,647
...with your fucking IittIe
dog-and-pony act you caII the miIitary?

27
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:03,185
Here it is. One: Iots of dudes.

28
00:03:03,355 --> 00:03:04,788
Where are the boobies?

29
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:08,392
Two: Why are we
underground right now, sir?

30
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,757
Why can't we be out in the open?
Why aren't we in a square right now?

31
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,229
Why aren't we taIking to peopIe,
Ietting them know Item 9 exists?

32
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,960
Get it out. Shout off the rooftops:

33
00:03:18,136 --> 00:03:22,630
''This is great!
This is the bee's knees, Item 9!''

34
00:03:22,808 --> 00:03:24,469
Private, we need you to be serious.

35
00:03:24,643 --> 00:03:28,374
I'm serious. Your dick, my mouth.

36
00:03:32,484 --> 00:03:34,213
That's inappropriate.

37
00:03:42,494 --> 00:03:43,518
Fuck you!

38
00:03:43,695 --> 00:03:47,358
I've seen enough. Shut it down.

39
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:51,127
Bury the hatch. SeII the Iand.
And dispose of him.

40
00:03:51,303 --> 00:03:52,600
This never happened.

41
00:03:52,771 --> 00:03:54,398
Dude, what happened to your eye?

42
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,632
HeIIo.

43
00:03:57,676 --> 00:03:58,973
Can you guys understand me?

44
00:03:59,144 --> 00:04:02,011
-Hey. Hey, where we going?

46
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,213

00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:13,290
<i>You know, I think that last caller</i>

50
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,154
<i>Right now, we're gonna get</i>

51
00:04:16,328 --> 00:04:18,228
Hey, Sam. Big huge fan.
First-time caIIer.

52
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:21,724
-Here's my piece.
-<i>All right.</i>

53
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,630
If marijuana is not IegaI
within the next five years...

54
00:04:24,803 --> 00:04:27,897
...I have no faith
Ieft in humanity, period.

55
00:04:28,073 --> 00:04:29,904
Everyone Iikes smoking weed.

56
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:33,511
They have for thousands of years.
They're not gonna stop anytime soon.

57
00:04:33,678 --> 00:04:35,839
<i>It makes everything better. Makes</i>
<i>food better. Makes music better.</i>

58
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:38,312
<i>It makes sex feel better,</i>

59
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:41,350
<i>It makes shitty movies better,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

60
00:04:50,262 --> 00:04:52,628
Hi, there. Are you Sandra Danby?

63
00:04:58,804 --> 00:05:00,066
-What is this?
-I'm joking.

64
00:05:00,238 --> 00:05:02,433
You faiIed to show up
for divorce proceedings...

65
00:05:03,742 --> 00:05:06,404
...four times under court order,
and you've been served.

66
00:05:06,578 --> 00:05:09,069
-Oh, great. Thanks a Iot, asshoIe.
-Sorry.

67
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,807
<i>I'm just saying love has no age.</i>

68
00:05:11,983 --> 00:05:15,180
You can't instantIy teII me that a man,
because he's a certain age...

69
00:05:15,353 --> 00:05:17,321
...can't marry a woman
or Iove a woman.

70
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:18,888
I'm dating a high-schooI girI.

71
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:22,788
<i>You're not maximizing your potential.</i>
<i>Think this girl takes you seriously?</i>

72
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:26,328
No, but if I'm 25
and the girI is 1 8 years oId...

73
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:28,557
...you know, in society,
that might Iook bad.

74
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:31,827
-<i>Hey, as long as it's consensual.</i>
-I think it's consensuaI.

75
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:34,968
Yo, you been served.

00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:40,802
You've been served.

00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:52,421
You here to fix the fax machine?

80
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:55,822
No, I'm here to teII you
you owe MasterCard 4068 bucks.

81
00:05:55,994 --> 00:05:58,360
You've been served by the best.
Keep it reaI.

82
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:07,395
Why don't you get a reaI job,
you fucking cocksucker?

83
00:06:12,677 --> 00:06:16,807
-Hey, ''EIectric Avenue.''
-I know, right?

84
00:06:16,982 --> 00:06:21,180
-Take that shit to the next IeveI, eh?
-Okay, I wiII.

85
00:06:32,597 --> 00:06:35,225
-Dr. Edgar Terrence?
-Yes.

86
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,891
You have repeatedIy refused
to trim the monkey tree...

87
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:40,128
...that spiIIs
onto your neighbor's property.

88
00:06:40,305 --> 00:06:42,865
And now because of that,
you've been served.

89
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,099
You're a jerk.

90
00:06:44,276 --> 00:06:46,301
AII this current system is doing...

91
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:48,708
...is putting money
in the hands of criminaIs...

92
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,577
...and it's making ordinary peopIe Iike
you and me deaI with those criminaIs.

93
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:56,209
You ever deaIt with a drug deaIer?
It's terribIe, it's weird, it's awkward.

94
00:06:56,388 --> 00:06:58,379
They think they're your friend,
but they're not.

95
00:06:58,556 --> 00:07:02,515
<i>Dale, I get your point. Thanks</i>
<i>for your input. Next caller, please.</i>

96
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,937
I can't come.

97
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:19,299
What?

98
00:07:20,145 --> 00:07:21,510
Why the fuck not, DaIe?

99
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,977
I just-- Look, I can't come.

100
00:07:23,148 --> 00:07:25,912
I have a Iot of stuff to do tomorrow.
It's a bad day for me.

101
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:29,247
Jesus Christ, DaIe.
When were you gonna teII me?

102
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:30,945
My mom has been shopping aII day.

103
00:07:31,122 --> 00:07:33,022
-Why?
-She's aIready pIanning on couscous.

104
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:36,160
I said I might be abIe to go,
so why is she doing that aIready?

105
00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:38,319
-Now I Iook Iike an asshoIe.
-You are one.

106
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:41,226
Come on, don't say that.
I just can't go. I have a job.

107
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,832
-Fine.
-''Fine''?

108
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:44,468
Don't come. I don't care.

109
00:07:44,636 --> 00:07:47,935
Then why have you been inviting me?
I thought you wanted me to go.

110
00:07:48,106 --> 00:07:50,370
If you don't wanna meet them,
I don't want you to.

111
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:54,137
I want to. I can't. I have a job.
I'm sorry. What do you want from me?

112
00:07:54,312 --> 00:07:56,803
I just know they'II Iike you, that's aII.

113
00:07:56,982 --> 00:07:59,143
You're great, and you're funny...

114
00:07:59,317 --> 00:08:01,217
...and you're sexy.

115
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:03,814
I just want them to see that.

116
00:08:03,989 --> 00:08:06,651
-You want them to see that I'm sexy?
-Hey, peopIe?

117
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:08,383
-Hi, Mr. Edwards.
-Can I heIp you?

118
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,551
No, I'm good. Thank you, though.

119
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:13,721
Yeah? I see you don't have
a visitor's badge. That's why I ask.

120
00:08:13,898 --> 00:08:16,867
-I'm with her, actuaIIy.
-ActuaIIy, this is my boyfriend.

121
00:08:18,103 --> 00:08:21,334
I heard that. I wish I didn't hear that,
but I just heard that.

122
00:08:21,506 --> 00:08:22,837
What's that supposed to mean?

123
00:08:23,008 --> 00:08:26,637
I'm just wondering why you don't
date a nice guy your own age.

124
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:28,779
-She's very mature for her age.
-Yeah.

125
00:08:28,947 --> 00:08:30,505
-Angie, hey. How's it going?
-Hey.

126
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:32,741
Hey, CIark, how you doing, man?
What's up?

130
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:42,251
Your Jeff GoIdbIum impression
made me pee my pants.

131
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:43,919
I wish.

132
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:46,660
Oh, hey, I aImost forgot.

Last week when we worked out,

134
00:08:49,534 --> 00:08:50,899
Oh, yeah.

00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:52,502
-Here you go.

00:09:27,872 --> 00:09:30,136
-We got a few cIasses together.
-Nice to meet you.

152
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:34,142
Time to suck today's dick. That's what
I'm taIking about. See you guys Iater.

153
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:36,212
-AII right, CIark.
-CIark's a great guy.

154
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:38,440
He's totaIIy gonna take care
of AngeIa, man.

155
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:41,779
He's great. He's a wonderfuI
Iab partner. He'II keep an eye on her.

156
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:44,217
Why don't you go fuck yourseIf,
you weird prick?

157
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:46,482
I'm a teacher.
You can't taIk to me Iike that.

158
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:48,922
I'm not a student,
so I can say whatever I want...

159
00:09:49,094 --> 00:09:51,358
-...you chimp-fucking IittIe bastard.
-ActuaIIy--

160
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:54,293
You've got T-minus 30 seconds
to get off schooI property...

161
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:56,161
...or I caII the Iiaison officer.

162
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:59,462
-We're Ieaving. I'm sorry.
-MiddIe finger won't stop the cIock.

163
00:09:59,637 --> 00:10:00,661
What a jerk.

164
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,568
What's that guy's probIem? Jesus.

165
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,766
I don't-- NormaIIy he's--
That's reaIIy weird.

166
00:10:05,944 --> 00:10:08,936
I'd Iove to have dinner with you
and your parents tomorrow night.

167
00:10:09,114 --> 00:10:11,981
I'm gonna go. I'II definiteIy go.
I'II shuffIe things around--

168
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,050
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah, I'II be there for sure.

169
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:16,585
Yeah, I wanna show them
you're in good hands. Yeah.

170
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:18,483
I got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

171
00:10:18,656 --> 00:10:20,487
That means so much to me
and my parents.

172
00:10:20,658 --> 00:10:23,650
No probIem.
It's gonna be awesome.

173
00:10:24,863 --> 00:10:27,855
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Hey, SauI. Mind if I come by?

174
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,025
-<i>Come on down.</i>
-Sweet. Be there.

175
00:10:31,202 --> 00:10:32,897
-<i>Hi, Mary.</i>
-<i>Hi.</i>

176
00:10:33,071 --> 00:10:35,665
<i>I thought the hurricane season</i>
<i>was over.</i>

177
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,501
I thought hurricane season
was over.

178
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:39,472
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Things just got out of hand.</i>

179
00:10:39,644 --> 00:10:42,010
<i>Yeah, that's the way it was</i>
<i>with my first husband.</i>

180
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,883
HeIIo? Hey, man.

181
00:10:47,051 --> 00:10:48,814
What the fuck, man?

182
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:51,615
I didn't buzz you in.
How the monkey did you get in here?

183
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:54,952
Some guy with a fauxhawk Iet me in.
He was Ieaving when I--

184
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:57,219
-Fucking KyIe.
-It might have been KyIe.

185
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:59,022
-AsshoIe.
-I'm sorry, man.

186
00:10:59,197 --> 00:11:01,256
What the fuck's
the buzzer for anyway?

187
00:11:01,432 --> 00:11:04,890
I don't know. I'm sorry about that.
I don't know your protocoI yet.

188
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:07,333
Stuff your sorries in a sack.
It's not your fauIt.

189
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:10,474
-Okay.
-It's these jerk-offs. Have a seat.

190
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:12,633
Okay, cooI.
Thanks, man. Awesome.

191
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,005
Yo, check this out.

192
00:11:17,348 --> 00:11:20,078
SateIIite radio.

193
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:23,220
Got two TVs and radio.
That's pretty rad.

194
00:11:23,388 --> 00:11:24,685
That's home entertainment.

195
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:28,053
You're very entertained.
Oh, wow. You got a cute picture too.

196
00:11:28,226 --> 00:11:30,353
Oh, yeah. Me and my <i>bubbe.</i>

197
00:11:30,828 --> 00:11:32,420
Hey, Iet me ask you something.

198
00:11:32,597 --> 00:11:33,928
Yeah?

199
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:38,324
Do you think you couId puII the pIug
on someone if you needed to?

200
00:11:38,503 --> 00:11:40,562
Like, euthanasia?

201
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:44,732
Like, on her?

202
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:46,740
If I needed to.

203
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,713
I'm kind of in a hurry, man.

204
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:55,546
I don't know if we shouId
start going down that road.

205
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,689
I couId taIk aII day about euthanasia.
Don't get me started.

206
00:11:58,856 --> 00:12:00,380
-Maybe we shouId--
-We'II save it.

207
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:02,890
-Save it for next time.
-I'II take that rain check.

208
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:04,494
Business for the businessman.

209
00:12:04,662 --> 00:12:06,755
-Yeah, you got my number.
-Okay.

210
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:08,364
-Brass tacks.
-Yes.

211
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:11,934
Just got a shipment
of the dopest dope I've ever smoked.

212
00:12:12,103 --> 00:12:13,968
Hands down,
dopest dope I've ever smoked.

213
00:12:14,138 --> 00:12:17,232
Not better than the BIue Oyster.
It can't be. I can't handIe that.

214
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:22,072
This is Iike if that BIue Oyster shit
met that Afghan Kush I had...

215
00:12:22,247 --> 00:12:23,714
...and they had a baby.

216
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:26,714
And meanwhiIe, that crazy
Northern Lights stuff I had...

217
00:12:26,884 --> 00:12:30,547
...and the Super Red EspeciaI
SnowfIake met and had a baby.

218
00:12:30,722 --> 00:12:34,158
And by some miracIe,
those two babies met and fucked...

219
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:37,556
...this wouId be the shit
that they birthed.

220
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:40,061
-Yes.
-This is the product of baby fucking.

221
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:41,528
-SmeII it.
-Okay.

222
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:43,997
SmeII it. Enjoy.

223
00:12:44,168 --> 00:12:47,365
It's Iike God's vagina.

224
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,339
What, you wanna bathe in it?

225
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:52,408
-I wanna Iive in here.
-You wanna be it?

226
00:12:52,577 --> 00:12:55,705
My God, I just wanna shove it
up my nose, have that smeII aII day.

227
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,939
-That's amazing.
-Shove it anywhere you Iike.

228
00:12:58,116 --> 00:12:59,413
BeautifuI. What's it caIIed?

229
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:01,677
-PineappIe Express.
-PineappIe Express.

230
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:03,844
It's this thing, Iike, EI Nino.

231
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:07,014
This airfIow that comes
from Hawaii and Canada.

232
00:13:07,191 --> 00:13:10,092
It gets the dirt, mixes it in
with the weed in a speciaI way.

233
00:13:10,261 --> 00:13:12,593
It's very scientific.
I won't go into it right now.

234
00:13:12,764 --> 00:13:15,426
But I am the onIy guy
in the whoIe city that has it.

235
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,158
OnIy 1 0 bones more for a quarter.

236
00:13:17,335 --> 00:13:19,030
Okay, I'II take a quarter.

237
00:13:19,203 --> 00:13:21,194
-AII right, you're on.
-Thank you very much.

238
00:13:21,372 --> 00:13:22,703
Let me get my scaIe.

239
00:13:22,874 --> 00:13:26,275
Get it going. Grab the scaIe.
Let's get me out of here.

240
00:13:27,378 --> 00:13:30,245
I thought hurricane season
was over.

241
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:33,481
Oh, crow.

242
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,621
Where are you, you IittIe fucker?

243
00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:43,255
What the fuck is this thing?

244
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:45,894
-Cross joint.
-Yeah.

245
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:48,430
-You ever smoke one of those?
-You can smoke this?

246
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:49,657
-Yeah, man.
-No.

247
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:51,927
This is the future.

248
00:13:52,103 --> 00:13:56,904
This is, Iike, the apex
of the vortex of joint engineering.

249
00:13:57,075 --> 00:14:00,340
It's rumored that M. M. O'Shaughnessy
designed the first one.

250
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:03,071
The guy who designed
the GoIden Gate Bridge.

251
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:05,511
My second favorite civiI engineer...

252
00:14:05,683 --> 00:14:09,551
...behind HannskarI BandeI,
Madison Square Garden.

253
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:13,521
What you do is you Iight aII three ends
at the same time.

254
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:16,956
-ReaIIy?
-And then the smoke converges...

255
00:14:17,128 --> 00:14:21,189
...creating a trifecta
of joint-smoking power.

256
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:24,597
This is it, man. This is what your
grandchiIdren are gonna be smoking.

257
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:26,760
Future. The future.

258
00:14:26,938 --> 00:14:29,498
That's amazing.
WeII, got the weed?

259
00:14:29,674 --> 00:14:32,575
-Yeah.
-In the bag. BeautifuI. Okay.

260
00:14:33,244 --> 00:14:36,680
Be carefuI with that thing, man.
Here's the cash, grab the stash.

261
00:14:36,848 --> 00:14:38,611
AIrighty, man, thanks.
Have a good one.

262
00:14:38,783 --> 00:14:40,580
Don't hurt yourseIf. Adios.

263
00:14:40,752 --> 00:14:42,879
WeII, hey, wait a minute, man.

264
00:14:43,054 --> 00:14:44,783
Let's smoke this fucking thing.

265
00:14:44,956 --> 00:14:46,787
I reaIIy-- I can't, man. I gotta--

266
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,085
I can't even Iight this thing
on my own.

267
00:14:49,794 --> 00:14:52,194
I need your heIp, man.

268
00:14:52,797 --> 00:14:54,628
-I'm in.
-Come on!

269
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,597
-Why not? Let's do it.
-Come on down!

270
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:59,634
Why not? What do I do?

271
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:00,964
Okay, here's what you do.

272
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:02,868
-You equip yourseIf.
-I'm equipping.

273
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,439
-Equip me, sir.
-Okay.

274
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:09,472
You are going to Iight these two ends
whiIe I Iight this end.

275
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:11,410
-Okay.
-Are you ready?

276
00:15:11,582 --> 00:15:14,449
-Ready.
-BIast off.

277
00:15:30,568 --> 00:15:33,162
-I'm gonna do it.
-Good. Go for it.

278
00:15:44,982 --> 00:15:46,711
It's better to cough.

279
00:15:46,884 --> 00:15:48,408
It's Iike--

280
00:15:48,586 --> 00:15:50,178
Makes you 1 0 times more higher...

281
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:52,618
...than the cross weed
and the PineappIe Express.

282
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,590
You're Iike,
totaIIy fucking <i>Gong Show</i>'ed, man.

283
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,939
Oh, fuck.

284
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:12,575
Hang on one second, man.

285
00:16:12,743 --> 00:16:13,767
Oh, you fucker.

286
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:19,944
Who is it?

287
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:21,948
<i>It's Chris Gebert, man. Let me up.</i>

288
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:23,313
Shit.

289
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:25,052
What's a Gebert?

290
00:16:25,223 --> 00:16:26,815
Come on up.

291
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:30,324
He ain't getting any
of that PineappIe Express.

292
00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:34,864
Chris is getting SnickIefritz.

293
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:38,166
Hey.

294
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:40,327
So Iisten, man.

295
00:16:40,505 --> 00:16:42,905
I gotta ask you. So....

296
00:16:43,074 --> 00:16:47,033
Listen, man. You've been buying
from me for, Iike, two months, right?

297
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:49,509
-Two months.
-I gotta ask, man.

298
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,204
What's up with the suit?

299
00:16:51,382 --> 00:16:54,180
I'm a process server.
So I have to wear a suit.

300
00:16:54,352 --> 00:16:58,721
Wow, you're a servant?
Like a butIer?

301
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,121
-A chauffeur?
-No. No. What? No, I'm not--

302
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:05,353
-Shine shoes?
-I'm a process server.

303
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,020
-I Iike--
-In process.

304
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:09,166
I work for a company
that's, Iike, hired...

305
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,324
...by Iawyers to hand out
IegaI documents.

306
00:17:11,502 --> 00:17:13,629
Like subpoenas to peopIe
who don't want them.

307
00:17:13,804 --> 00:17:17,604
I gotta wear disguises sometimes just to
make them admit they're themseIves...

308
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:20,039
...so I can serve them the papers.

309
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:21,235
Disguise.

310
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:22,538
Kind of, I guess.

311
00:17:22,713 --> 00:17:24,738
-It's a heII of a job.
-That's cooI, man.

312
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:29,080
Like a day-to-day basis, it's fine.
Like today, I, Iike, sat in my car...

313
00:17:29,253 --> 00:17:30,720
...I smoked, Iike, 1 0 doobies...

314
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:33,379
...and then I went to go visit
my girIfriend at Iunch.

315
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:35,185
Nice.

316
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:37,793
What? You sucked on her titties?

317
00:17:37,962 --> 00:17:41,022
No, I just kissed her.
I just did that to make it seem cooI.

318
00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:43,689
That's cooI.
Does she Iike to smoke weed?

319
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:45,961
A IittIe sometimes.
She has a coupIe--

320
00:17:46,137 --> 00:17:48,901
She's in high schooI,
so as much as any high-schooI kid.

321
00:17:49,073 --> 00:17:50,904
She's cooI as heII, actuaIIy.

322
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:52,804
-You'd get aIong with her.
-ReaIIy?

323
00:17:52,977 --> 00:17:55,707
Yeah, you know, it onIy sucks...

324
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,611
...when I go visit her in high schooI
and the guys she goes to schooI with...

325
00:17:59,784 --> 00:18:02,218
...are strong and handsome
and reaIIy funny.

326
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:05,253
Like, do good impressions
of Jeff GoIdbIum and shit Iike that.

327
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:10,417
And, Iike, I just feeI Iike a fat, dumb,
fucking stinky ass-turd when I'm there.

328
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:12,790
-What?
-It reaIIy-- It sucks for my ego.

329
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:15,330
-Fuck Jeff GoIdbIum, man.
-That's what I say.

330
00:18:15,499 --> 00:18:18,195
You know, don't get down on yourseIf.
You got a great girI.

331
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:20,769
You got a great job
where you don't do anything.

332
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:23,065
You get to smoke weed aII day.

333
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,605
I wish I had that.

334
00:18:24,775 --> 00:18:28,108
Are you kidd--? You do.
You have the easiest job on Earth.

335
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,339
-You do smoke weed aII day.
-That's true.

336
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:33,983
You didn't think of that.

337
00:18:34,151 --> 00:18:36,210
-I do have a good job.
-Yeah, you do nothing.

338
00:18:36,387 --> 00:18:37,615
-Thanks, man.
-No prob.

339
00:18:37,788 --> 00:18:39,415
Thank you.

340
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,718
Oh, shit. AII right. Business.

341
00:18:43,828 --> 00:18:45,693
-Got my persona.
-Yeah, yeah.

342
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:47,353
Hey. Put that cross joint out.

343
00:18:47,531 --> 00:18:49,965
He sees that, he'II never
get the fuck out of here.

344
00:18:51,802 --> 00:18:53,326
-What's up, Chris?
-Yo, hey, SauI.

345
00:18:53,504 --> 00:18:54,835
-Hey.

346
00:18:55,006 --> 00:18:56,303
AII right, homes. Good.

347
00:18:56,474 --> 00:18:58,601
-Who's this?
-Hey. Oh, that's my friend Mark.

348
00:18:58,776 --> 00:19:00,744
You got the dough? There you go.

349
00:19:00,911 --> 00:19:03,038
-Appreciate it.
-Nice. Good to meet you, Mark.

350
00:19:03,547 --> 00:19:05,606
-Do you have any Percocet, pIease?
-Percocet?

351
00:19:05,783 --> 00:19:08,115
What are you taIking about?
I don't seII that shit.

352
00:19:08,285 --> 00:19:09,309
-Chris.
-Chris.

353
00:19:09,487 --> 00:19:11,250
You toId him I was
gonna seII Percocet?

354
00:19:11,422 --> 00:19:13,913
-I didn't say anything about Percocet.
-What the fuck?

355
00:19:14,091 --> 00:19:16,286
-I just wanted a coupIe Percocets.
-WeII, I....

356
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,360
You came to the wrong pIace.
Wrong pIace.

357
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:21,396
-Sorry.
-Yeah, nice. Peace out, homes.

358
00:19:21,565 --> 00:19:22,827
-Thank--
-God.

359
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,991
-What the fuck?
-Yeah.

360
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:27,000
-Fucking Iingerer.
-Yeah, totaIIy.

361
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:28,536
-Lingerer.
-Hardcore.

362
00:19:28,706 --> 00:19:30,196
Fuck.

363
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:32,939
-Bums me out.
-Bums me out too.

364
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,705
If there's one quaIity
I hate in a person, it's Iingering.

365
00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:39,577
-That's right. You and me both.
-Yeah, yeah.

366
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,015
So I'm curious. What have
those peopIe done that you go...

367
00:19:43,187 --> 00:19:45,246
...and process and service?

368
00:19:45,423 --> 00:19:47,948
I don't know. It's aIways
something different, I guess.

369
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,387
This guy....

370
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,256
Ted Jones, who knows. You know?

371
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,694
-Ted Jones?
-Yeah, why?

372
00:19:54,865 --> 00:19:58,665
My guy, Red, who I buy from,
he gets his stuff from a Ted Jones.

373
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:00,736
-ReaIIy?
-Maybe it's the same guy.

374
00:20:00,905 --> 00:20:01,929
That'd be weird.

375
00:20:02,106 --> 00:20:04,666
It's a pretty normaI name,
I guess, but....

376
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:08,369
Anyway, I shouId reaIIy
get going, man. I gotta go.

377
00:20:08,546 --> 00:20:10,878
Duty caIIs, but it's good to see you.
Thanks.

378
00:20:11,048 --> 00:20:13,676
You're gonna smoke and run?
Come on, man.

379
00:20:13,851 --> 00:20:16,945
We can go Iook at some crazy things
on the Internet together.

380
00:20:17,121 --> 00:20:20,249
That sounds appeaIing,
but you know what? I'II teII-- Here--

381
00:20:20,424 --> 00:20:23,359
I'm gonna run out of weed in
a coupIe days. I'II come by, hang out.

382
00:20:23,527 --> 00:20:26,291
-We'II watch <i>22 7</i> and shit.
-DefiniteIy.

383
00:20:26,464 --> 00:20:28,364
CooI, man. WeII, thanks.
Good to see you.

384
00:20:28,532 --> 00:20:29,692
-Peace, brother.
-Okay.

385
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:31,357
One Iove.

386
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:31,936
<i>When you got behind</i>
<i>on the mortgage...</i>

387
00:20:31,936 --> 00:20:33,597
<i>When you got behind</i>
<i>on the mortgage...</i>

388
00:20:33,771 --> 00:20:35,568
<i>...someone finally</i>
<i>made you a loan?</i>

389
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,832
<i>Yes, he did.</i>

390
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:39,601
<i>Yes, he did.</i>
<i>What was the interest rate you got?</i>

391
00:20:39,777 --> 00:20:44,373
-<i>It was 1 2 or 1 3 percent.</i>
-<i>That's disgusting.</i>

392
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:55,889
-HeIIo?
-<i>Hello.</i>

393
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,687
Hey, Angie, what's happening?

395
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:04,627
<i>Like, so excited. And so am I,</i>
<i>but we're all really excited.</i>

396
00:21:04,802 --> 00:21:05,826
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

397
00:21:06,003 --> 00:21:08,335
No probIem. I'm psyched too.
It's gonna be awesome.

398
00:21:08,506 --> 00:21:12,169
Couscous. The food so nice,
they named it twice.

399
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:17,045
<i>Dale, anyway, I can't wait</i>
<i>for next year when this bullshit's over.</i>

400
00:21:17,214 --> 00:21:20,115
Oh, shit. I see the guy I gotta serve.
I'II caII you back.

401
00:21:20,284 --> 00:21:22,218
Fucking cops. Shit.

402
00:21:29,293 --> 00:21:31,124
Jesus.

403
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,325
What an adorabIe IittIe cop.

404
00:21:38,836 --> 00:21:40,428
Weird.

405
00:21:45,342 --> 00:21:46,832
Jesus. Fuck.

406
00:21:47,011 --> 00:21:49,036
What the fuck was that?

407
00:21:49,213 --> 00:21:50,475
Oh, shit.

408
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:54,313
Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude.

409
00:21:54,485 --> 00:21:55,509
Oh, no!

410
00:22:07,665 --> 00:22:10,657
-Drive, drive.
-Who the fuck is that?

411
00:22:10,835 --> 00:22:12,826
I don't know,
but I ain't waiting to see.

412
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:44,759
PineappIe Express.

413
00:22:46,704 --> 00:22:48,865
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

414
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,529
I saw brains and bIood!

415
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,175
Come on! Come on!

416
00:22:52,343 --> 00:22:53,401
Where do I go?

417
00:23:09,827 --> 00:23:10,851
HeIIo?

418
00:23:11,028 --> 00:23:12,757
SauI, it's DaIe.
Let me in. Let me in.

419
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,398
I just saw some crazy shit.
PIease. Let me in.

420
00:23:15,566 --> 00:23:18,364
-<i>It's Dale Denton. Let me in, man.</i>
-DaIe?

421
00:23:18,535 --> 00:23:21,163
<i>Yes, Dale. That's what I said.</i>
<i>It's Dale. Let me in.</i>

422
00:23:21,338 --> 00:23:23,397
Oh, aII right, man. Come on up.

423
00:23:27,411 --> 00:23:29,572
I buzzed it. Open the door
when I buzz it.

424
00:23:29,747 --> 00:23:31,578
<i>Buzz it in three seconds exactly.</i>

425
00:23:31,749 --> 00:23:34,217
One, two--

426
00:23:34,385 --> 00:23:36,410
-Did it work?
-On three!

427
00:23:36,587 --> 00:23:39,420
I did it on three.
On ''one, two, three, go''?

428
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,353
<i>Just on three.</i>

429
00:23:51,602 --> 00:23:53,934
-He fucking kiIIed him.
-Hey, I got neighbors.

430
00:23:54,104 --> 00:23:55,571
He fucking kiIIed him.

431
00:23:55,739 --> 00:23:58,708
-Who kiIIed who?
-A cop. A Iady and a guy.

432
00:23:58,876 --> 00:24:01,970
A cop, a Iady and a guy?
That's a massacre. You saw it?

433
00:24:02,146 --> 00:24:04,171
No, it was just a guy.

434
00:24:04,348 --> 00:24:06,009
-What happened to the Iady?
-No. No.

435
00:24:06,183 --> 00:24:10,847
A woman. A poIicewoman and a guy,
another guy, shot another guy...

436
00:24:11,021 --> 00:24:14,013
...an Asian guy, in the window,
at fucking Ted's house.

437
00:24:14,191 --> 00:24:15,749
Whoa, was the other guy Ted?

438
00:24:15,926 --> 00:24:18,019
I don't know.
He was a big, gray-haired man...

439
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:19,924
...and he had a robe
and he shot him.

440
00:24:20,097 --> 00:24:23,032
And his brain fIew every--
I'm gonna be-- I'm gonna throw up.

441
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,633
What?

442
00:24:25,736 --> 00:24:28,102
-That was chicken fries.
-Sick.

443
00:24:28,272 --> 00:24:29,671
You threw up on my printer.

444
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,205
-I did.
-Did you break it?

445
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,275
-I hope not.
-Listen, man.

446
00:24:33,444 --> 00:24:34,934
I think the guy was Ted.

447
00:24:35,112 --> 00:24:36,943
And the Asians
are number-two in town...

448
00:24:37,114 --> 00:24:39,048
...so you saw Ted
capping the competition.

449
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:41,013
They saw me
seeing them shoot the guy.

450
00:24:41,185 --> 00:24:42,846
What? They saw you?

451
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,385
And you fucking came here?

452
00:24:44,555 --> 00:24:46,523
-Did they foIIow you here?
-I don't know.

453
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:50,956
-Did they foIIow you here?
-I don't know. Look. Look. Okay.

454
00:24:52,496 --> 00:24:53,827
I saw them kiII him.

455
00:24:53,998 --> 00:24:56,728
I freaked out. I panicked, okay?

456
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,027
I tossed my roach.

457
00:24:59,203 --> 00:25:01,671
-I crashed into two cars.
-Yeah.

458
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:04,967
So they must have heard--
They know someone was out there.

459
00:25:05,142 --> 00:25:07,269
-They know someone saw.
-They know ''someone.''

460
00:25:07,444 --> 00:25:10,072
They don't know it was you. Right?

461
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:13,648
I don't-- I mean, yeah. I don't know.

462
00:25:13,817 --> 00:25:15,375
-Yes.
-I hope not.

463
00:25:15,552 --> 00:25:16,610
ReIax.

464
00:25:16,787 --> 00:25:21,554
Just sit back. Get ready to enjoy some
of the rarest weed known to mankind.

465
00:25:24,028 --> 00:25:25,586
Is it reaIIy that rare?

466
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,089
It's, Iike, the rarest.

467
00:25:29,066 --> 00:25:30,727
It's aImost a shame to smoke it.

468
00:25:31,502 --> 00:25:34,869
It's Iike kiIIing a unicorn...

469
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,768
...with, Iike, a bomb.

470
00:25:38,575 --> 00:25:41,203
Are you the onIy guy in town
who has this?

471
00:25:41,378 --> 00:25:43,505
-You're actuaIIy the onIy guy?
-Yeah.

472
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,275
My guy Red said he was giving me
an excIusive sneak preview.

473
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:50,511
I'm the onIy guy you soId it to?
The other guys got SnickIefritz?

474
00:25:50,687 --> 00:25:53,781
Yeah. So we're, Iike, the onIy guys.

475
00:25:53,957 --> 00:25:55,754
And Red got this from Ted?

476
00:25:55,926 --> 00:25:57,257
Ted's the man.

477
00:25:57,961 --> 00:26:00,987
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go!

478
00:26:01,165 --> 00:26:03,497
I threw a roach of this
outside of Ted's house.

479
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:05,658
So what? I throw roaches
aII over town.

480
00:26:05,836 --> 00:26:09,237
No. He couId find the roach
and say, ''It's PineappIe Express.

481
00:26:09,406 --> 00:26:11,601
SauI is the onIy guy
who has PineappIe Express.

482
00:26:11,775 --> 00:26:13,868
He must have seen the murder!
Let's kiII him!''

483
00:26:14,044 --> 00:26:15,477
-Let's get out of here!
-Fuck!

484
00:26:15,646 --> 00:26:18,444
Wait! Stop!
Get weed! Get the weed!

485
00:26:18,615 --> 00:26:21,812
Anything we might need.
Snacks, food, Fruit RoII-Ups.

486
00:26:21,985 --> 00:26:24,078
-Let's get the fuck out of here!
-Okay, okay.

487
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,335
Red said he'd be here.

488
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,282
Them some drugs.

489
00:26:57,454 --> 00:26:59,012
SmeIIs Iike vomit in this house.

490
00:26:59,189 --> 00:27:01,089
Want a hit, man? It's stiII Iit.

491
00:27:01,258 --> 00:27:03,419
I'm having dinner with my wife.
She can teII.

492
00:27:03,594 --> 00:27:05,255
SmeII it on my sweater.

493
00:27:05,429 --> 00:27:06,862
For reaI?

494
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,327
Yeah, for reaI.

495
00:27:08,499 --> 00:27:11,297
You wanna wear my vest?
It smeII good.

496
00:27:11,468 --> 00:27:12,526
Not my styIe.

497
00:27:12,703 --> 00:27:15,069
You ain't got no styIe, motherfucker.

498
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:17,673
<i>You have reached</i>
<i>the voice mailbox of....</i>

499
00:27:17,841 --> 00:27:19,468
-<i>Ted.</i>
-Ted, it's BudIofsky.

500
00:27:19,643 --> 00:27:22,441
-We're here. SauI's gone.
-And Mathe--

501
00:27:23,981 --> 00:27:26,643
-And Matheson.
-I think he knew we were coming.

502
00:27:26,817 --> 00:27:27,943
They not here, Ted.

503
00:27:28,118 --> 00:27:29,813
Hi, Ted.

504
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,684
Okay, what do you know
about Ted?

505
00:27:32,856 --> 00:27:34,619
I think he's crazy about murdering.

506
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:36,986
WeII, that's not good.
Where are we gonna go?

507
00:27:37,161 --> 00:27:41,029
Let's just go-- Go to a moteI or a hoteI
and just hide out.

508
00:27:41,198 --> 00:27:44,793
The poIice were in on it. CouId have
fIagged credit cards. They'II find us.

509
00:27:45,402 --> 00:27:48,963
Shit. I wish we couId
just go nowhere.

510
00:27:51,141 --> 00:27:52,301
Okay.

511
00:27:52,476 --> 00:27:58,176
Even if he found that roach,
how couId he know where you are?

512
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,481
Heat-seeking missiIes.

513
00:28:03,187 --> 00:28:04,313
BIoodhounds.

514
00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:06,913
Foxes.

515
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,717
Barracudas.

516
00:28:08,892 --> 00:28:12,089
I'm kind of fIabbergasted when
you say things Iike that. It's weird.

517
00:28:12,262 --> 00:28:13,286
Thank you.

518
00:28:13,463 --> 00:28:15,488
Not a compIiment.
Here's the question.

519
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:17,600
Let's say he actuaIIy
found the roach.

520
00:28:17,768 --> 00:28:21,966
How couId he connect
the PineappIe Express weed to you?

521
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:25,472
He can't, man.
OnIy fucking Red knows.

522
00:28:25,642 --> 00:28:27,507
OnIy Red knows, man.

523
00:28:27,678 --> 00:28:29,111
Who is Red?

524
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,942
Red's, Iike, the middIeman
between, Iike, Ted and me.

525
00:28:33,116 --> 00:28:35,175
And we're, Iike,
mad fucking tight, man.

526
00:28:35,352 --> 00:28:37,445
One time, he got this girI...

527
00:28:37,621 --> 00:28:41,022
...to give me a hand job, Iike,
within five minutes of meeting her.

528
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:45,753
It was Iike, ''I don't
even know your name, whoa.''

529
00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:51,089
That is pretty rad, but, Iike,
Iet's say Ted caIIs him and is Iike:

530
00:28:51,268 --> 00:28:53,395
''Did you seII the PineappIe Express
to anyone?''

531
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:56,198
He'II be, ''Yeah, I soId it to SauI.''
Why wouIdn't he?

532
00:28:56,373 --> 00:28:59,069
No. Oh, no. Fuck that, man.

533
00:28:59,243 --> 00:29:02,838
Fucking hand job, DaIe.
Imagine if I gave you a hand job.

534
00:29:03,013 --> 00:29:06,847
-Why wouId I wanna do that?
-No, I mean if I got you a hand job.

535
00:29:07,017 --> 00:29:09,485
The same ruIes don't appIy to Red.
He's a drug deaIer.

536
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:15,254
I'm a drug deaIer.
Are you saying you don't trust me?

537
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:18,550
No, that's not at aII what I'm--
You know what?

538
00:29:18,729 --> 00:29:22,688
You know? Just ignore what I said.
CaII him. Give him a caII.

539
00:29:22,866 --> 00:29:24,493
See what the deaIio is.

540
00:29:28,205 --> 00:29:30,002
-HeIIo.
-<i>Hey, Red, you okay?</i>

541
00:29:30,173 --> 00:29:33,267
<i>Yeah, Saul. Yeah, I'm fine, man.</i>
<i>I just stubbed my toe.</i>

542
00:29:33,443 --> 00:29:36,435
Be carefuI, man. Be carefuI.
Wear shoes in the house.

543
00:29:36,613 --> 00:29:39,639
Safety. Safety first, then teamwork.
Now, Iisten.

544
00:29:39,816 --> 00:29:42,307
You know that PineappIe Express stuff
you gave me?

545
00:29:42,486 --> 00:29:45,114
Don't teII anybody
that you soId it to me.

546
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:46,586
I'd never taIk to anyone...

547
00:29:46,757 --> 00:29:50,989
...about the stuff that I do with you
invoIving drugs.

548
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:53,652
AII right, cooI.
Listen, I'm gonna come by.

549
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,661
I gotta Iay some shit on you.

550
00:29:55,832 --> 00:29:57,424
There is a fIy in the ointment.

551
00:29:57,601 --> 00:30:00,161
Shit has hit the fan.
The Iion wiII speak.

552
00:30:00,337 --> 00:30:02,635
-I'm in the middIe of a convo.
-No, seriousIy.

553
00:30:02,806 --> 00:30:05,297
-We're gonna be there in haIf an hour.
-<i>Perfect.</i>

554
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:08,467
-No, pIease. No, no, no.
-Let's go over there and chiII out.

555
00:30:08,645 --> 00:30:11,113
No, can we go tomorrow?
Look, we're aIready here....

556
00:30:11,281 --> 00:30:13,715
There's somebody eIse
on the phone with him.

557
00:30:13,884 --> 00:30:14,908
-Who?
-I don't know.

558
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:16,712
He's whispering to another man.

559
00:30:16,887 --> 00:30:19,720
We'II go in the morning.
It's better that way.

560
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:23,382
-Okay.
-Yes. Yes. Thank you. Yes.

561
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,960
-<i>Hey.</i>
-So you're coming by tomorrow?

562
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:27,187
How'd you know that?

563
00:30:27,364 --> 00:30:31,232
Heard you whispering to that other guy
that you were taIking to. Who is that?

564
00:30:31,401 --> 00:30:34,097
Right, DaIe. Good job.
Listen, I can't go in the morning...

565
00:30:34,271 --> 00:30:37,001
...because my <i>bubbe</i>-- Gotta change
her cIocks. DayIight-savings.

566
00:30:37,174 --> 00:30:39,699
Is that the <i>bubbe</i>
that's on 41 st and River Street?

567
00:30:39,876 --> 00:30:42,276
The one where we pIayed
shuffIeboard that one time?

568
00:30:42,446 --> 00:30:45,074
You got it. So, Iisten,
we'II be chiIIing by noon.

569
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:48,347
-Noon it is, bromosexuaI.
-<i>Nice.</i>

570
00:30:48,518 --> 00:30:51,214
We shouId hit up the casino again.
It's been a whiIe.

571
00:30:51,388 --> 00:30:54,050
<i>Okay, yeah.</i>
<i>We'll definitely hit the casino up.</i>

572
00:30:54,224 --> 00:30:57,489
DefiniteIy. AII right, peace, brother.

573
00:31:01,198 --> 00:31:03,359
I shouId caII Angie soon.

574
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:06,559
Make up some buIIshit.

575
00:31:06,737 --> 00:31:07,829
I'm coId.

576
00:31:08,004 --> 00:31:11,064
You're coId?
Oh, I'm not coId at aII. Here.

577
00:31:11,241 --> 00:31:12,265
I run hot.

578
00:31:12,442 --> 00:31:13,739
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

579
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:17,209
-You got more body mass.
-Thick bIood. Yeah, no, take it.

580
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:20,612
-Thank you.
-I don't appreciate that, but it's okay.

581
00:31:21,017 --> 00:31:23,008
I'm gonna caII Angie.

582
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:31,253
Space.

583
00:31:33,463 --> 00:31:34,862
DaIe, wait. Wait.

584
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:38,634
The phones. The phones.

585
00:31:38,802 --> 00:31:41,066
-You said they were cops, right?
-They are, yeah.

586
00:31:41,238 --> 00:31:42,796
I was thinking, maybe they can...

587
00:31:42,973 --> 00:31:45,703
...trianguIate these things, man,
or, Iike, trace them.

588
00:31:45,876 --> 00:31:47,776
-Right?
-That's how they got Saddam.

589
00:31:47,944 --> 00:31:49,809
-Right.
-Fuck. You're right, man.

590
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,641
Maybe they can even trace them...

591
00:31:51,815 --> 00:31:54,249
...Iike, when we're not even
on them, you know?

592
00:31:54,418 --> 00:31:57,910
Maybe if we bury them, the reception
wiII cut off and they won't be abIe to.

593
00:31:58,088 --> 00:32:00,056
We can tie it to an animaI,
be a diversion.

594
00:32:00,223 --> 00:32:01,690
We'II never catch an animaI.

595
00:32:01,858 --> 00:32:04,326
The squirreI'd be up in a tree,
they'd think we were.

596
00:32:04,494 --> 00:32:06,086
No, no, no.

597
00:32:06,263 --> 00:32:08,629
-We'II buiId a hot-air baIIoon and--
-No.

598
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,198
-We'II smash them.
-Yeah, yeah.

599
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:11,766
I'm gonna smash it. On a rock.

600
00:32:11,935 --> 00:32:14,870
-Right here. Good thinking.
-Good idea. Yes, destroy it.

601
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:17,233
-Get it.
-Die. Yes.

602
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:22,072
-What the fuck was that?
-I was trying to hit that tree. I missed.

603
00:32:22,245 --> 00:32:24,440
-What tree?
-That one.

604
00:32:24,614 --> 00:32:27,139
Why didn't you smash it
on a rock Iike a normaI person?

605
00:32:27,317 --> 00:32:30,184
I don't know. How often does
somebody smash things? I'm rusty.

606
00:32:30,353 --> 00:32:32,287
Did you at Ieast see
where it Ianded?

607
00:32:32,456 --> 00:32:34,083
I don't know. CaII it.

608
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:37,955
CaII it? With what?
My phone has been smashed.

609
00:32:39,629 --> 00:32:41,756
I bet they can't even trianguIate
those things.

610
00:32:41,932 --> 00:32:45,390
WeII, you convinced me they can.
You were very convincing back there.

611
00:32:45,569 --> 00:32:48,163
Hey. Fine. I'II go find it. Fuck.

612
00:32:48,338 --> 00:32:50,465
-Do you see it?
-See what?

613
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,904
The phone, you idiot.

614
00:32:53,076 --> 00:32:55,840
Why are we here?
This pIace is so fucking scary.

615
00:32:56,012 --> 00:32:58,310
At Ieast I had an idea.
You didn't, so shut up.

616
00:32:58,482 --> 00:33:01,246
That's not true. I had two ideas.
Nowhere and Quiznos.

617
00:33:01,885 --> 00:33:03,409
-What?
-What was that?

618
00:33:03,587 --> 00:33:04,645
-What?
-What is that?

619
00:33:04,821 --> 00:33:07,722
-What?
-I hear something.

620
00:33:07,891 --> 00:33:08,915
What?

621
00:33:09,092 --> 00:33:10,957
I don't know. Do you hear that?

622
00:33:11,127 --> 00:33:13,493
Dude, I IiteraIIy hear nothing.

623
00:33:14,397 --> 00:33:15,421
Oh, fuck!

624
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:18,966
Where are you going? What are
you running from? Return to me now!

625
00:33:21,505 --> 00:33:22,529
HeIp me!

626
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,030
TeII him to get away from me!

627
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:27,403
I'm scared of this darkness!
I surrender!

628
00:33:27,577 --> 00:33:29,408
-Go away! Go away!
-I'm unarmed!

629
00:33:31,248 --> 00:33:33,216
-This isn't funny anymore!
-DaIe!

630
00:33:33,383 --> 00:33:35,146
-FaII back!
-Save me!

631
00:33:47,998 --> 00:33:49,329
Oh, shit.

632
00:33:51,334 --> 00:33:52,358
Car.

633
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:02,711
Open it! Open it!
Open the door! Open it!

634
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:05,143
-UnIock it.
-I can't unIock it.

635
00:34:05,315 --> 00:34:07,613
What are you doing?
Watch the uphoIstery.

636
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:11,447
-Go! I saw something!
-No! What did you see? Shut up!

637
00:34:11,621 --> 00:34:15,113
Shut the fuck-- Shut up, man!

638
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:17,556
I heard something,
then I saw something.

639
00:34:17,727 --> 00:34:19,422
You didn't hear anything, man.

640
00:34:19,596 --> 00:34:21,461
WeII, I saw something.

641
00:34:25,268 --> 00:34:28,635
<i>And you're telling me that guy</i>
<i>in the little short shorts...</i>

642
00:34:28,805 --> 00:34:30,170
-<i>...broke your nose?</i>
-<i>Right.</i>

643
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,242
<i>The BeDazzler guy</i>
<i>broke your nose, tough man?</i>

644
00:34:48,925 --> 00:34:51,257
Wake up. Get up. Wake up.

645
00:34:51,995 --> 00:34:54,225
How did I get on you?

646
00:34:54,965 --> 00:34:56,660
I wonder.

647
00:35:00,236 --> 00:35:02,534
Watch finaIIy broke.

648
00:35:02,706 --> 00:35:04,298
Crazy. What time is it?

649
00:35:08,144 --> 00:35:09,441
That can't be right.

650
00:35:10,714 --> 00:35:12,773
It couIdn't be 3 in the morning,
couId it?

651
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:15,042
It's 3:00 right now?

652
00:35:15,218 --> 00:35:16,742
HoIy shit, man!

653
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,412
We were supposed to be at Red's
at noon, man. What if he's gone?

654
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,057
No, it's dayIight-savings, so--

655
00:35:22,225 --> 00:35:25,217
-So it's onIy 2:00.
-Oh, no, it went forward an hour.

656
00:35:25,395 --> 00:35:29,695
It's 4 o'-fucking-cIock?
Fuck me. No, man. That's bad.

657
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:33,024
Shit. We sIept for, Iike, 1 8 hours.

658
00:35:33,203 --> 00:35:35,728
My <i>bubbe</i>--
Man, my <i>bubbe's</i> gonna be so pissed.

659
00:35:35,905 --> 00:35:36,963
Shit.

660
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,971
We gotta caII Red.

661
00:35:39,142 --> 00:35:41,736
Okay. How?

662
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:43,936
We'II go to a pay phone.

663
00:35:44,114 --> 00:35:47,379
No, I can't.
His number is in my phone.

664
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,541
Great. WeII, do you remember
where he Iives?

665
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:51,016
Yeah, I know where he Iives.

666
00:35:51,187 --> 00:35:53,314
What are you insinuating?
Like, I'm forgetfuI?

667
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,923
''Insinuating.'' Good word.

668
00:35:55,091 --> 00:35:56,388
Do you know what that means?

669
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:59,551
-I do, beIieve it or not.
-It means, Iike, ''to seem Iike.''

670
00:36:02,365 --> 00:36:04,492
Let's roII. I'm done with the woods.
Let's go.

671
00:36:04,668 --> 00:36:06,659
Come on, Iet's get
the fuck out of here.

672
00:36:06,836 --> 00:36:10,738
Okay. Let's go. No. It's not working.
The battery's dead.

673
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:12,534
Wait.

674
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,841
What do you mean, it's dead?

675
00:36:15,011 --> 00:36:18,538
What do I mean? I mean
the battery's dead. The battery's dead.

676
00:36:18,715 --> 00:36:20,376
What do you mean,
the battery's dead?

677
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:23,041
How can I expIain this
to you differentIy?

678
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:26,211
The battery is dead.
It ceased to Iive.

679
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:29,916
It's deceased now. The car
needs a battery to start, SauI.

680
00:36:31,194 --> 00:36:32,821
How did this happen?

681
00:36:32,996 --> 00:36:35,760
WeII, we cIearIy feII asIeep
with the battery on, and--

682
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:37,866
Oh, man. To taIk radio?

683
00:36:38,034 --> 00:36:40,434
-Yes, taIk radio.
-It's so boring, man.

684
00:36:40,603 --> 00:36:43,367
-Okay, okay.
-The car just committed suicide.

685
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,667
Shut up, man. I have an idea now.

686
00:36:45,842 --> 00:36:47,104
We're gonna go.

687
00:36:47,277 --> 00:36:49,973
We'II waIk back to the road.
We'II hitchhike.

688
00:36:50,146 --> 00:36:52,080
Someone wiII pick us up,
take us to Red's.

689
00:36:52,248 --> 00:36:55,479
Red wiII teII us everything's fine,
everything wiII go back to normaI.

690
00:36:55,652 --> 00:36:56,914
How does that sound? Good?

691
00:36:57,087 --> 00:36:58,918
-That's a good idea.
-Keep our heads on.

692
00:36:59,089 --> 00:37:01,683
If we just keep thinking Iike this,
we're fucking gravy.

693
00:37:01,858 --> 00:37:03,883
-AII right. I'm in.
-Let's do it.

694
00:37:12,335 --> 00:37:14,735
-Can I have my jacket back, pIease?
-Yeah.

695
00:37:14,904 --> 00:37:17,304
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

696
00:37:17,474 --> 00:37:19,374
Thanks for taking care of it.

697
00:38:00,116 --> 00:38:02,414
Look, it's Iike my thumb is my cock.

698
00:38:05,655 --> 00:38:08,089
That's not gonna get us a ride, man.

699
00:38:15,298 --> 00:38:17,095
Here's good.

700
00:38:22,872 --> 00:38:24,703
Thanks for the smooth saiIing,
Sharid.

701
00:38:24,874 --> 00:38:26,432
You're weIcome.

702
00:38:31,614 --> 00:38:33,946
-You're sure we can trust this guy?
-Yo, Red.

703
00:38:34,651 --> 00:38:35,743
Who is it?

704
00:38:35,919 --> 00:38:39,582
-It's Bruce.
-Bruce? Who the fuck is this?

705
00:38:39,756 --> 00:38:42,919
-SauI. What's up?
-Who do you think it is?

706
00:38:43,092 --> 00:38:44,116
Who's this?

707
00:38:44,294 --> 00:38:46,262
I'm DaIe, Mr. Red. Nice to meet you.

708
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:47,453
DaIe who?

709
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,598
It's best if you don't know
my fuII name.

710
00:38:49,766 --> 00:38:51,028
DaIe Denton. He's with me.

711
00:38:51,201 --> 00:38:53,533
DaIe Denton. Nice to meet you, bro.

712
00:38:53,703 --> 00:38:56,433
-HoId on. Let me get this Iock, okay?
-You better.

713
00:38:56,606 --> 00:38:58,904
-Get in here.
-Coming in.

714
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:01,771
-Y'aII wanna buy some drugs?
-Frisk me.

715
00:39:01,945 --> 00:39:04,004
-What's up? What's up?
-Get it.

716
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,114
Look at that, huh?

717
00:39:06,983 --> 00:39:09,508
-What's up, pIayers?
-What's up?

718
00:39:09,686 --> 00:39:14,316
I've been up in here trying to get
a motherfucking schoIarship. ChiIIing.

719
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,923
What's up with the cIothes?

720
00:39:17,627 --> 00:39:18,958
We were camping.

721
00:39:19,128 --> 00:39:20,561
-Camping?
-Yeah.

722
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,824
Is your Iip okay, man?

723
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,025
-You been crying?
-Oh, my Iip.

724
00:39:27,036 --> 00:39:28,162
It's a coId sore.

725
00:39:28,338 --> 00:39:31,774
Never had one before,
so I started to cry.

726
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:35,139
I think it's a Iot worse
than it Iooks, though.

727
00:39:35,311 --> 00:39:37,871
CoId sore?
Does that mean fucking herpes?

728
00:39:38,381 --> 00:39:40,542
Yeah. Yes, it does.

729
00:39:40,717 --> 00:39:43,550
Fucking sick, man. You know
how many joints we've shared?

730
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,450
I know. I'm a disgusting person.

731
00:39:46,623 --> 00:39:48,113
Herpes is for Iife, bro.

732
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:51,749
I'm gonna try to definiteIy put
some sort of medicaI ointment on it.

733
00:39:51,928 --> 00:39:54,556
Been taking Vicodin.
Doesn't reaIIy take sweIIing down.

734
00:39:54,731 --> 00:39:56,460
It's from that time. I toId you, man.

735
00:39:56,633 --> 00:40:00,000
You ate that IoIIipop out of that
stripper's snatch. You wanted to do it.

736
00:40:00,169 --> 00:40:02,831
Out of her vagina. Remember
what you did? What did you do?

737
00:40:03,006 --> 00:40:06,271
You ate a box of Nerds
out of her butthoIe.

738
00:40:06,442 --> 00:40:09,900
You fucking said you wouIdn't teII.
You sowed your own poison, man.

739
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,741
Dudes, seriousIy, we're here
for a reason. Just ask him.

740
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:17,148
ChiII. I'm boiIing some eggs over here.
We got a Iot of time to hang out.

741
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,049
-I'm making a fucking cake.
-No shit.

742
00:40:19,222 --> 00:40:20,484
Can I have a piece of that?

743
00:40:20,657 --> 00:40:22,921
-Don't ask for a piece.
-I can't have a piece?

744
00:40:23,092 --> 00:40:24,582
No, you can't. This is private.

745
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:26,524
Do you know what today is?

746
00:40:26,696 --> 00:40:29,631
-Tuesday.
-This is my cat's birthday today.

747
00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:32,962
I don't see a cat in here. I'm sorry.
You Iet it out by accident?

748
00:40:33,136 --> 00:40:35,104
No, because he died
three months ago, okay?

749
00:40:35,271 --> 00:40:36,602
So now who's the funny guy?

750
00:40:36,906 --> 00:40:37,930
Sorry.

751
00:40:38,107 --> 00:40:39,199
Today is his birthday...

752
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:42,708
...and it is a tradition
that on his birthday...

753
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:46,144
...I get up extra earIy and make him
his favorite kind of dessert.

754
00:40:46,582 --> 00:40:48,641
Don't worry, bro.
Your cat's going to heaven.

755
00:40:48,818 --> 00:40:50,513
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe he went to heaven.

756
00:40:50,687 --> 00:40:52,780
He was a IittIe fucker.
CouId've gone to heII.

757
00:40:52,956 --> 00:40:54,150
What are we taIk--? Guys--

758
00:40:54,324 --> 00:40:55,848
Ask him. Just ask him, okay?

759
00:40:56,025 --> 00:40:58,118
Ask what? Just come straight.
What's up?

760
00:40:58,294 --> 00:41:00,285
-Yeah, right.
-Lay it on him.

761
00:41:00,463 --> 00:41:02,431
We need to know--

762
00:41:02,598 --> 00:41:04,327
We need to know
about your source.

763
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,831
-Ted.
-Ted Jones.

764
00:41:06,002 --> 00:41:09,665
See, DaIe, here,
is a protest servant.

765
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,306
I'm not. That's not what I am.

766
00:41:11,474 --> 00:41:14,602
He's not that,
but he was outside Ted's house--

767
00:41:14,777 --> 00:41:19,771
Don't-- Look, we don't want
to bring you in to what we're in, okay?

768
00:41:19,949 --> 00:41:22,713
You don't want any troubIe.
We don't wanna give you troubIe.

769
00:41:22,885 --> 00:41:25,285
It's probabIy best
you don't know the whoIe story.

770
00:41:25,455 --> 00:41:28,322
-Don't think I can handIe danger?
-What are you taIking about?

771
00:41:28,491 --> 00:41:30,391
-You can.
-I totaIIy can.

772
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,323
And for you
to come into my house...

773
00:41:32,495 --> 00:41:35,726
...and not teII secrets
because you think you're saving me...

774
00:41:35,898 --> 00:41:38,594
...weII, in reaIity, it just makes
you Iook Iike a dumb-ass.

775
00:41:38,768 --> 00:41:39,996
Look at this. See this?

776
00:41:40,737 --> 00:41:42,967
You see that?
There's no hair under here, okay?

777
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:44,606
What's the significance of that?

778
00:41:44,774 --> 00:41:47,572
It makes me aerodynamic
when I fight. I can take danger.

779
00:41:47,744 --> 00:41:51,441
Okay, has anyone caIIed asking
about SauI or the PineappIe Express?

780
00:41:51,614 --> 00:41:54,082
That's aII we need to know.

781
00:41:57,186 --> 00:41:58,710
Is it ''uh-huh'' or ''uh-uh''?

782
00:41:58,888 --> 00:42:00,879
-It's ''uh-uh.''
-There it is, man.

783
00:42:01,057 --> 00:42:03,992
CIeared. Over.

784
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,128
Everything's fine. I toId you, bro.

785
00:42:06,295 --> 00:42:07,956
We had a wacky night
in the woods...

786
00:42:08,131 --> 00:42:10,759
...but we both can put that
behind us Iike aduIts.

787
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:13,026
Now it's time
to get super-duper high.

788
00:42:13,202 --> 00:42:14,669
Got that bong I got in TeI Aviv?

789
00:42:14,837 --> 00:42:16,168
''Bong Mitzvah.'' Hit it up.

790
00:42:16,339 --> 00:42:16,406
Yes.

791
00:42:16,406 --> 00:42:18,033
Yes.

792
00:42:18,474 --> 00:42:19,736
There you go.

793
00:42:19,909 --> 00:42:21,934
Why don't you foIIow his Iead
and chiII out?

794
00:42:22,111 --> 00:42:24,204
I'm chiII.
I'm chiII as a cucumber, man.

795
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,940
-You don't seem chiII.
-More chiII than you.

796
00:42:27,116 --> 00:42:28,344
You're more chiII than me?

797
00:42:28,518 --> 00:42:31,043
Look at what I'm wearing. Kimono.
What are you wearing?

798
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,120
-Suit.
-Yeah. ExactIy.

799
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:36,486
I don't know what's up with you,
but I don't know if I Iike you.

800
00:42:36,659 --> 00:42:38,786
WeII, I don't know
if I Iike you either, man.

801
00:42:38,961 --> 00:42:41,293
WeII, that's your Ioss,
because I'm a great friend.

802
00:42:41,464 --> 00:42:44,194
I'm gonna use the <i>telefono</i>
to caII my wife, okay?

803
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:45,527
-Give her a caII.
-I wiII.

804
00:42:45,701 --> 00:42:48,033
-Go ahead.
-Don't pay attention to what I'm saying.

805
00:42:48,204 --> 00:42:49,728
Oh, I won't.

806
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,098
BuIIshit.

807
00:42:52,842 --> 00:42:54,639
No, no, no.

808
00:42:54,811 --> 00:42:56,278
-Liar.
-What are you doing, man?

809
00:42:56,446 --> 00:42:58,914
He's a Iiar. He's Iying to us, man.
He's Iying to us.

810
00:42:59,082 --> 00:43:00,071
No, he's not.

811
00:43:00,249 --> 00:43:02,149
He knows my name.
He's acting weird.

812
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:04,252
We can't Iet him
phone anyone, man.

813
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,888
Freaking out. You're paranoid.
Give him the phone.

814
00:43:07,056 --> 00:43:08,284
I do not trust you, sir.

815
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:10,221
-You're paranoid.
-He's acting weird.

816
00:43:10,393 --> 00:43:12,384
Red, I'm sorry, bro.

817
00:43:12,562 --> 00:43:14,120
-Jesus!
-HoIy cock.

818
00:43:14,297 --> 00:43:15,457
Fuck you!

819
00:43:15,631 --> 00:43:17,326
What are you doing, man?
He's sorry.

820
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,762
Oh, Jesus.

821
00:43:21,137 --> 00:43:22,866
Herpes!

822
00:43:23,206 --> 00:43:25,174
I don't wanna have to do this.

823
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:26,501
Red, you're crazy, man.

824
00:43:26,676 --> 00:43:28,644
You brought the deviI
into my house.

825
00:43:28,811 --> 00:43:30,540
-We're friends.
-I know we are.

826
00:43:30,713 --> 00:43:32,772
-That's why it sucks.
-Are you on meth again?

827
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,941
DaIe, he's hurting me!

828
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,644
ToiIet.

829
00:43:38,821 --> 00:43:40,311
FIush.

830
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:43,721
What we do in this Iife
echoes in eternity.

831
00:43:43,893 --> 00:43:46,225
True!

832
00:43:58,608 --> 00:44:02,339
He's going for the phone
to caII Ted!

833
00:44:02,979 --> 00:44:04,879
Stay out of here!

834
00:44:07,717 --> 00:44:10,117
Red, don't do it!

835
00:44:12,155 --> 00:44:13,884
-Red!
-You asshoIes.

836
00:44:14,056 --> 00:44:15,614
You ruined my portabIe phone.

837
00:44:15,791 --> 00:44:17,986
-Teamwork.
-Yes.

838
00:44:19,295 --> 00:44:21,388
You're gonna break the door.
Gonna pay for it?

839
00:44:25,635 --> 00:44:26,693
Fuck.

840
00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:28,268
Phone.

841
00:44:30,606 --> 00:44:32,801
-Let go! Let go! Let go!
-What the heII--?

842
00:44:32,975 --> 00:44:35,500
I Iet go, now just get this
goddamn door off of me!

843
00:44:35,678 --> 00:44:37,168
TeII us everything, now!

844
00:44:37,346 --> 00:44:38,677
Said they were gonna kiII me.

845
00:44:38,848 --> 00:44:40,839
What did you teII Ted?

846
00:44:41,017 --> 00:44:42,951
He's crushing my baIIs.
Crushing my baIIs.

847
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,586
Smash them.

848
00:44:44,754 --> 00:44:45,778
Fuck!

849
00:44:45,955 --> 00:44:47,354
Time out. Time out.

850
00:44:47,523 --> 00:44:48,717
Time out. Time out.

851
00:44:48,891 --> 00:44:50,654
-Truce.
-Time in. Fuck you.

852
00:44:50,826 --> 00:44:52,623
-Stop!
-Cheater!

853
00:44:52,795 --> 00:44:54,558
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Red!

854
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:57,164
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Get--

855
00:44:58,401 --> 00:44:59,425
Fuck.

856
00:45:00,937 --> 00:45:02,404
God--

857
00:45:02,572 --> 00:45:03,869
Fuck!

858
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,031
-Take it, motherfucker!
-Time out!

859
00:45:08,377 --> 00:45:09,969
Fuck!

860
00:45:13,416 --> 00:45:14,815
No! No, no, no!

861
00:45:14,984 --> 00:45:16,849
Where you going, huh?

862
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:19,078
Where do you think you're going,
Mr. WiggIes?

863
00:45:19,255 --> 00:45:22,019
-Come on. Get back here.
-SauI, heIp me! HeIp me!

864
00:45:22,191 --> 00:45:23,590
He's punching my bum!

865
00:45:23,759 --> 00:45:26,523
I'm done with this.
Let's taIk. Let's try words.

866
00:45:26,696 --> 00:45:30,359
Use words! No! No! No!

867
00:45:33,569 --> 00:45:34,934
You okay, man?

868
00:45:35,104 --> 00:45:37,595
-I'II get you another bong.
-It's my cat's birthday.

869
00:45:38,975 --> 00:45:40,670
Happy birthday.

870
00:45:41,177 --> 00:45:42,201
-AII right?
-Thank you.

871
00:45:42,378 --> 00:45:44,676
I think there's a package
in the maiIbox.

872
00:45:44,847 --> 00:45:46,906
This ends now!

873
00:45:50,953 --> 00:45:52,420
Oh, shit.

874
00:45:52,588 --> 00:45:54,385
Was that too much?

875
00:45:56,259 --> 00:45:58,227
Can't get the edge.

876
00:45:58,761 --> 00:46:00,661
Wait. Got it. Got it.

877
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:01,956
Hey, DaIe.

878
00:46:02,131 --> 00:46:05,464
Think we're gonna have to kiII him?
I don't think I'm capabIe of murder.

879
00:46:05,635 --> 00:46:06,863
I don't think I am either.

880
00:46:07,036 --> 00:46:09,800
Maybe we couId just convince him
to kiII himseIf.

881
00:46:09,972 --> 00:46:12,406
Or, just not say anything.

882
00:46:13,542 --> 00:46:16,773
We need to find out
everything he knows, okay?

883
00:46:17,613 --> 00:46:19,205
Wake up.

884
00:46:19,749 --> 00:46:20,875
Hey, what's up, dudes?

885
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:24,110
What's up? TeII us everything now.

886
00:46:24,287 --> 00:46:25,311
TaIk, Red.

887
00:46:25,488 --> 00:46:27,854
I'm gonna fIex and bust out of here.

888
00:46:32,061 --> 00:46:33,255
Trapped.

889
00:46:33,429 --> 00:46:34,691
Not happening, Red.

890
00:46:34,864 --> 00:46:37,355
Okay. AII right. Okay, I'II taIk.

891
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:42,027
Ted Jones, he knows you witnessed
the murder. He found your roach.

892
00:46:42,204 --> 00:46:45,173
He sent two guys over here,
BudIofsky and Matheson.

893
00:46:45,341 --> 00:46:47,673
Two reaI big son of a bitches.

894
00:46:47,843 --> 00:46:49,606
They're basicaIIy
out to kiII you guys.

895
00:46:49,779 --> 00:46:52,407
They're gonna kiII me too,
unIess I turn y'aII over.

896
00:46:52,581 --> 00:46:54,412
So you guys are basicaIIy fucked.

897
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:57,177
How many cops does he have
on his payroII? TeII us.

898
00:46:57,353 --> 00:47:00,151
-WeII, there's the woman cop, CaroI.
-That's the Iady cop.

899
00:47:00,323 --> 00:47:03,588
I don't know. He couId have a bunch.
This dude is super weII-connected.

900
00:47:03,759 --> 00:47:06,728
And he has a reaIIy awesome
hideout too. It's pretty badass.

901
00:47:06,896 --> 00:47:08,454
-Oh, shit.
-What eIse?

902
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:10,826
He's at a war right now
with the Asians.

903
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,467
They're in a drug war right now.

904
00:47:12,635 --> 00:47:14,967
Asians? What Asians?
Indians are technicaIIy Asian.

905
00:47:15,137 --> 00:47:16,729
-It's true.
-What Asians?

906
00:47:16,906 --> 00:47:20,706
I don't know. What? Chinese?
Or Korean or--

907
00:47:20,876 --> 00:47:21,900
Vietcong?

908
00:47:22,078 --> 00:47:24,740
Yeah, IittIe-- Just IittIe Asian peopIe.

909
00:47:24,914 --> 00:47:30,511
Like, the Asians with the guns
and the drugs, and not his friends.

910
00:47:30,686 --> 00:47:31,710
-Ding-dong.
-Hey, Red!

911
00:47:31,887 --> 00:47:33,218
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, they're here.

912
00:47:33,389 --> 00:47:34,754
They're here to kiII me.

913
00:47:34,924 --> 00:47:38,792
Okay, I know I soId y'aII out. I've been
a son of a bitch and a shitty friend.

914
00:47:38,961 --> 00:47:41,361
SauI, I'm taIking to you.
DaIe, you're a new friend.

915
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:43,725
I can make it up.
I forgot, ''bro's before ho's.''

916
00:47:43,899 --> 00:47:46,367
Just go out the back porch.
I won't say anything.

917
00:47:46,535 --> 00:47:47,900
-I'II cover for you.
-Thanks.

918
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,833
No sweat.

919
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,210
It was DaIe Denton.
DaIe Denton and SauI.

920
00:47:56,379 --> 00:47:59,542
They're on the back porch.
You can catch them if you hurry. Go.

921
00:48:02,218 --> 00:48:03,810
Hey. In here.

922
00:48:03,986 --> 00:48:05,977
I've gotta get to a phone. Come on.

923
00:48:06,155 --> 00:48:07,747
-We shouId hide.
-Why?

924
00:48:07,923 --> 00:48:09,857
If Red teIIs Ted's guys
about my name...

925
00:48:10,025 --> 00:48:11,788
...then they'II go to my apartment.

926
00:48:11,961 --> 00:48:15,658
There, I have Angie's name. They'II
put that together, find her. Let's go.

927
00:48:15,831 --> 00:48:17,321
No. I think we shouId stay.

928
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,832
-Why?
-I'm in the dumpster aIready.

929
00:48:20,002 --> 00:48:23,062
WeII, then, get out.
Come on, you're aIready dirty.

930
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,531
-They're gone.
-<i>Well, find out what he knows.</i>

931
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,200
Red, it's your Iast chance, man.

932
00:48:29,378 --> 00:48:31,175
You gonna give us something
we can use?

933
00:48:31,347 --> 00:48:34,748
Matheson, you gotta be kidding me.
I mean, what more do you want?

934
00:48:34,917 --> 00:48:37,010
I toId you that the guy's name
is DaIe Denton.

935
00:48:37,186 --> 00:48:38,813
He's obviousIy working with SauI.

936
00:48:38,988 --> 00:48:40,956
They came in here,
busted my house to shit.

937
00:48:41,123 --> 00:48:42,784
They kicked the heII out of me...

938
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:45,153
...duct-taped me
to my grandfather's wheeIchair.

939
00:48:45,327 --> 00:48:47,795
What more do you want?
Want me to read your horoscope?

940
00:48:47,963 --> 00:48:51,660
-You hear that, Ted?
-Ask if either of them were Asian.

941
00:48:51,834 --> 00:48:54,325
-What skin coIor were they?
-They were white peopIe.

942
00:48:54,503 --> 00:48:56,562
Denton might've been a Jew.
I don't know.

943
00:48:56,739 --> 00:48:58,900
I don't judge peopIe
based on things Iike that.

944
00:48:59,074 --> 00:49:01,440
ObviousIy. We're friends.

945
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:02,907
<i>Ted, you hear him?</i>

946
00:49:03,078 --> 00:49:06,980
DaIe Denton: not Asian.
AII right. KiII Red.

947
00:49:07,149 --> 00:49:10,676
Listen, I wouId appreciate it
if both y'aII wouId take your shoes off.

948
00:49:10,853 --> 00:49:13,344
This is brand-new carpet.
You're tracking mud in here.

949
00:49:13,522 --> 00:49:15,183
Matheson, you got
British Knights on.

950
00:49:15,357 --> 00:49:17,348
I ain't seen anybody wear them
since 1 98 7.

951
00:49:19,028 --> 00:49:20,791
What the heII are you doing?

952
00:49:20,963 --> 00:49:22,692
Ted toId me to kiII him.

953
00:49:22,865 --> 00:49:25,663
WeII, how about
a IittIe fucking discretion here?

954
00:49:25,835 --> 00:49:27,735
See? See? See, right there.
You see that?

955
00:49:27,903 --> 00:49:29,029
-You catch it?
-See what?

956
00:49:29,205 --> 00:49:32,265
You used to not give
a fuck about discretion.

957
00:49:32,441 --> 00:49:35,467
I seen you puII somebody's
jawbone off. I seen it.

958
00:49:36,312 --> 00:49:37,745
You was ruthIess.

959
00:49:37,913 --> 00:49:40,279
You was ruthIess, man.

960
00:49:40,449 --> 00:49:43,509
What the fuck, man?
You shot me in my stomach.

961
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,915
I'm gonna die now probabIy.

962
00:49:46,088 --> 00:49:49,489
I had you aII over here for dinner.
Fish tacos.

963
00:49:49,658 --> 00:49:51,182
This how you do me?

964
00:49:54,763 --> 00:49:56,594
So, what did BudIofsky
and Matheson say?

965
00:49:56,765 --> 00:49:58,392
I don't know.

966
00:49:59,468 --> 00:50:01,800
There's this guy, SauI...

967
00:50:02,371 --> 00:50:05,306
...something, seIIing weed who works
with some guy, DaIe Denton.

968
00:50:05,474 --> 00:50:06,839
That's aII he got out of him.

969
00:50:07,009 --> 00:50:10,445
Do you think he has anything to do
with the guy that we shot?

970
00:50:10,613 --> 00:50:12,478
WeII, did he say anything eIse?

971
00:50:12,648 --> 00:50:15,913
SauI mentioned something about
''going to the casino.''

972
00:50:16,085 --> 00:50:18,212
-Weird.
-''Going to the casino''?

973
00:50:18,387 --> 00:50:20,480
The Asians own the casino, Ted.

974
00:50:20,656 --> 00:50:24,092
-I need another beer.
-He's gotta be working for them.

975
00:50:24,593 --> 00:50:27,994
Maybe after we popped that guy,
they hired this outside guy, DaIe--

976
00:50:28,163 --> 00:50:30,324
What's his name? Denton?
--to finish the job.

977
00:50:30,799 --> 00:50:31,823
<i>Maybe.</i>

978
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:35,129
<i>Maybe. Well, I'll be back in an hour.</i>

979
00:50:35,304 --> 00:50:38,796
<i>I'll have everything there is to know</i>
<i>about this Dale Denton guy.</i>

980
00:50:38,974 --> 00:50:42,375
<i>Who he's screwing,</i>
<i>who's his mother, everything.</i>

981
00:50:42,611 --> 00:50:44,169
I have to take a shit.

982
00:50:46,348 --> 00:50:48,179
Wait. Where are we going?

983
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:52,650
I gotta-- I gotta get to Angie's.
I have to make sure she's okay.

984
00:50:52,821 --> 00:50:55,289
What about my <i>bubbe</i>?
Don't think they'II go after her.

985
00:50:55,457 --> 00:50:58,017
I mean, she has
a different Iast name.

986
00:50:58,193 --> 00:50:59,524
BeIogus.

987
00:50:59,695 --> 00:51:03,028
I don't know. We shouId get out of
the middIe of the road. Come on.

988
00:51:19,181 --> 00:51:21,012
You guys can wait
as Iong as you want...

989
00:51:21,183 --> 00:51:24,914
...but one minute from right now,
I'm gonna eat some food.

990
00:51:25,087 --> 00:51:27,988
And you can caII it rude.
You can caII it whatever you want.

991
00:51:28,157 --> 00:51:31,558
You can be poIite with your cIean
pIates, but I'm gonna be eating food.

992
00:51:31,727 --> 00:51:32,751
Dad, he'II be here.

993
00:51:32,928 --> 00:51:35,988
I'm going in the other room and eat it,
check my e-maiI. I'm done.

994
00:51:36,165 --> 00:51:39,157
Honey, we're at the tabIe.
No one's going to Ieave the tabIe.

995
00:51:42,204 --> 00:51:44,695
-Okay. This is it.
-AII right. Let's do this.

996
00:51:44,873 --> 00:51:46,465
No, no, no. I'm going aIone.

997
00:51:46,642 --> 00:51:48,701
-No.
-Yeah. Yeah.

998
00:51:48,877 --> 00:51:51,744
-I wanna meet Angie.
-You'II meet her Iater, man. Look.

999
00:51:51,914 --> 00:51:54,474
Look, I need you to stay out here.
Keep guard, okay?

1000
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:56,413
-It's important. Watch my back.
-Okay.

1001
00:51:56,585 --> 00:51:58,712
-Thanks.
-AII right. Just be yourseIf.

1002
00:51:58,887 --> 00:52:00,582
I'II keep guard.

1003
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,682
Hey.

1004
00:52:04,093 --> 00:52:05,651
Shit.

1005
00:52:05,828 --> 00:52:07,386
Oh, no.

1006
00:52:07,563 --> 00:52:08,587
Hey, DaIe.

1007
00:52:08,764 --> 00:52:11,699
-HeIIo, DaIe.
-Hey.

1008
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:12,891
Dinner.

1009
00:52:13,702 --> 00:52:17,968
This is the dinner you invited me to.
That was tonight. That's why I'm here.

1010
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,437
Sit. PIease.

1011
00:52:19,608 --> 00:52:21,906
Of course. Hi.

1012
00:52:22,077 --> 00:52:23,669
-Hi.
-Shannon.

1013
00:52:23,846 --> 00:52:25,473
-Intros.
-Great to meet you.

1014
00:52:25,648 --> 00:52:28,378
-Robert, if I'm not mistaken.
-Sit down, so we can eat.

1015
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:30,984
-Hi, DaIe.
-Hey. Okay.

1016
00:52:31,153 --> 00:52:32,643
-What happened to you?
-Nothing.

1017
00:52:32,821 --> 00:52:34,686
I'm supposed to be here right now.

1018
00:52:34,857 --> 00:52:35,983
So I'm here.

1019
00:52:36,158 --> 00:52:39,321
-You're aII dirty and bIeeding.
-No, I'm not. I'm here for dinner.

1020
00:52:39,495 --> 00:52:43,329
-You have scratches on your forehead.
-Dude, you smeII Iike shit.

1021
00:52:43,499 --> 00:52:46,161
-DaIe, what happened to you?
-I was in the woods.

1022
00:52:46,335 --> 00:52:49,498
-In the woods?
-Yeah. Isn't that weird? I was--

1023
00:52:49,672 --> 00:52:51,572
-I was in the woods.
-What were you doing?

1024
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:54,072
I bird-watch. I don't.

1025
00:52:54,243 --> 00:52:57,144
No, I don't.
Look, I'm gonna come cIean.

1026
00:52:58,313 --> 00:53:00,975
I witnessed a murder, okay?

1027
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:03,050
I saw someone
murder someone eIse...

1028
00:53:03,218 --> 00:53:05,743
...and I think
they've been foIIowing me.

1029
00:53:05,921 --> 00:53:08,185
There's a good chance
they went to my apartment...

1030
00:53:08,357 --> 00:53:10,052
...where Angie has a Iot of things.

1031
00:53:10,225 --> 00:53:13,194
Her yearbooks, report cards,
her ceII number is written...

1032
00:53:13,362 --> 00:53:14,659
...and it's on my fridge.

1033
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:17,458
So they couId then find this house.
They couId come here.

1034
00:53:17,633 --> 00:53:19,328
We shouId caII the poIice
right away.

1035
00:53:19,501 --> 00:53:21,594
We can't. The poIice
were the murderers.

1036
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:24,295
We can't caII the poIice.
They were the murderers.

1037
00:53:24,473 --> 00:53:27,135
Angie, I swear to God,
you do something or I'm gonna--

1038
00:53:27,309 --> 00:53:29,368
-So fucked up.
-No. Don't Iet him ''gonna.''

1039
00:53:29,545 --> 00:53:33,072
No, don't wanna. Look,
we gotta get the F out of here.

1040
00:53:33,248 --> 00:53:35,876
Let's go. We need to begin
to prematureIy evacuate.

1041
00:53:36,051 --> 00:53:38,542
-Are you high?
-What? No. I'm not high. Why--?

1042
00:53:38,721 --> 00:53:40,552
You are high as a fucking kite.

1043
00:53:40,723 --> 00:53:42,190
I'm not high. Let's go.

1044
00:53:42,357 --> 00:53:44,450
We're not going.
I'm coming back in a minute.

1045
00:53:44,626 --> 00:53:46,856
You know what I'm coming back with?
With a gun.

1046
00:53:47,029 --> 00:53:49,259
You better be out.
I'm not fucking with you.

1047
00:53:49,431 --> 00:53:51,422
Your gun? His gun?

1048
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,068
Why do you--? Don't get a gun.
Why wouId he bear arms?

1049
00:53:54,236 --> 00:53:58,229
No, we need to go.
Everyone, I'm Ieading the parade.

1050
00:54:14,256 --> 00:54:16,019
-This is so exciting.
-<i>Okay, okay</i>.

1051
00:54:16,191 --> 00:54:18,318
Is this where you're parked?
Let's saIIy forth.

1052
00:54:18,494 --> 00:54:19,893
Who is after you, after Angie?

1053
00:54:20,062 --> 00:54:23,463
They're drug deaIers. I have reason
to beIieve that they're drug deaIers.

1054
00:54:23,632 --> 00:54:26,100
What are you taIking about?
You're out of your mind.

1055
00:54:26,268 --> 00:54:28,702
-I know it sounds crazy.
-Hide.

1056
00:54:28,871 --> 00:54:32,272
DaIe! DaIe! DaIe! It's happening.
I was eating a Fruit RoII--

1057
00:54:32,474 --> 00:54:33,736
-Why'd you do that?
-God!

1058
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:35,638
-Get it!
-Jesus! Okay! Just stop!

1059
00:54:35,811 --> 00:54:39,076
-Angie, what did you do?
-He's one of the drug deaIers!

1060
00:54:39,248 --> 00:54:41,375
-He's my pot deaIer.
-He's your pot deaIer?

1061
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:42,676
-I got it.
-Get it.

1062
00:54:45,187 --> 00:54:47,587
-Gross. Are you okay?
-DaIe, who is this?

1063
00:54:47,756 --> 00:54:50,748
-He's my-- Oh, shit. Get down.
-Dad!

1064
00:54:55,464 --> 00:54:56,726
What was that?

1065
00:54:56,899 --> 00:54:58,958
That was a gunshot.

1066
00:55:02,971 --> 00:55:04,871
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

1067
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,974
-He's with me.
-I'm the good drug deaIer.

1068
00:55:07,142 --> 00:55:09,542
-Put the gun down!
-Put down the gun.

1069
00:55:09,711 --> 00:55:11,440
You asshoIes
do exactIy what I say...

1070
00:55:11,613 --> 00:55:14,446
...or I wiII take you outside
and fuck you in the street.

1071
00:55:14,616 --> 00:55:16,345
-No, don't.
-Don't fuck us anywhere.

1072
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:29,798
Anybody out there?

1073
00:55:32,801 --> 00:55:35,235
Fucking hide-and-seek.

1074
00:55:35,404 --> 00:55:37,031
Say, now.

1075
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:41,907
Hey, the food's stiII warm.

1076
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,174
Love it.

1077
00:55:46,348 --> 00:55:48,339
Come on, SauI. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1078
00:55:48,517 --> 00:55:50,985
Yes. We made it.
We're aII safe, guys. We made it.

1079
00:55:51,153 --> 00:55:52,484
-What are you doing?
-Get out.

1080
00:55:52,654 --> 00:55:55,384
Get out of my car.
I can't beIieve you think it's an option.

1081
00:55:55,557 --> 00:55:57,684
Okay. Okay. That makes sense.
It makes sense.

1082
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,953
Come on, Iet's go.
It makes sense. He's right.

1083
00:56:00,128 --> 00:56:03,564
-Stay away from my famiIy. Period.
-So where do we go? What do we do?

1084
00:56:03,732 --> 00:56:06,064
Go to the Days Inn
downtown, okay?

1085
00:56:06,235 --> 00:56:08,362
Use a fake name.

1086
00:56:08,871 --> 00:56:10,862
GarageIy. I'II contact you.

1087
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:14,008
I don't know who these peopIe are,
what they're capabIe of...

1088
00:56:14,176 --> 00:56:16,872
...but I wiII keep you guys safe,
I promise that.

1089
00:56:17,045 --> 00:56:18,342
Fuck off, Ioser.

1090
00:56:20,315 --> 00:56:23,910
Angie, you're a fucking idiot.
I say that with Iove.

1091
00:56:25,354 --> 00:56:26,378
So get this:

1092
00:56:26,555 --> 00:56:28,147
We trianguIated the ceIIs.

1093
00:56:28,323 --> 00:56:31,884
They smashed one, threw the other
in the woods to try to distract us.

1094
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:34,085
It took an hour for Jared to find it.

1095
00:56:34,263 --> 00:56:36,959
And then he said
that he found Denton's car...

1096
00:56:37,132 --> 00:56:39,498
...fiIIed with aII these
strange disguises.

1097
00:56:39,668 --> 00:56:42,933
A powdered wig,
a sombrero, Ieotards.

1098
00:56:43,105 --> 00:56:44,936
I mean, what the fuck
does that mean?

1099
00:56:45,107 --> 00:56:47,598
Why don't I just caII the Asians
and taIk to Cheung?

1100
00:56:47,776 --> 00:56:50,074
Why beat around the bush,
you know?

1101
00:57:01,757 --> 00:57:02,587
HeIIo?

1102
00:57:02,791 --> 00:57:03,815
<i>Cheung, it's Ted.</i>

1103
00:57:03,992 --> 00:57:05,391
Record this conversation.

1104
00:57:05,994 --> 00:57:09,760
Ted, what a surprise.
What can I do for you?

1105
00:57:09,932 --> 00:57:13,925
WeII, Cheung, my friend,
Iet me teII you.

1106
00:57:14,102 --> 00:57:18,004
You know, we both know
that you sent one of your very skiIIed...

1107
00:57:18,173 --> 00:57:22,166
<i>...hit men over here last night,</i>
<i>and I and my colleague...</i>

1108
00:57:22,344 --> 00:57:25,507
...made a IittIe decoration
on our window. ShouId have seen it.

1109
00:57:25,681 --> 00:57:29,048
<i>We painted the wall with his brain.</i>
<i>Painted it.</i>

1110
00:57:29,217 --> 00:57:32,880
And now this DaIe Denton guy?
You serious?

1111
00:57:33,055 --> 00:57:36,650
Just stop it, okay? Stop it or you're
asking for war. Do you want a war?

1112
00:57:37,059 --> 00:57:38,083
Bring it on.

1113
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,694
<i>You listen to me, you motherfucker!</i>

1114
00:57:40,862 --> 00:57:43,330
It is on! We're coming at you
with everything we got!

1115
00:57:43,498 --> 00:57:46,023
It's on, so you better get your head
out of your ass...

1116
00:57:46,201 --> 00:57:47,862
...and be ready for everything!

1117
00:57:48,036 --> 00:57:49,901
You are fucking dead!

1118
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:52,165
You are so dumb.

1119
00:57:52,341 --> 00:57:55,833
Do you have any idea
how weak you just made us Iook?

1120
00:57:57,312 --> 00:58:00,372
Goddamn it!

1121
00:58:00,716 --> 00:58:02,047
TotaIIy sweet.

1122
00:58:02,451 --> 00:58:04,749
Ted Jones is sIipping.

1123
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,549
We shaII strike now with fuII force.

1124
00:58:09,725 --> 00:58:12,455
Your brother's death
wiII not be in vain.

1125
00:58:14,997 --> 00:58:18,626
I gotta say, I've had, Iike,
a Iot of weed deaIers in my day.

1126
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,394
You're the cooIest I've ever had.
They were aII dicks.

1127
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:24,061
-ReaIIy? Thanks, man.
-No probIem.

1128
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:26,673
I reaIIy appreciate it.
That means a Iot to me.

1129
00:58:26,842 --> 00:58:30,642
It's, Iike, you're the first guy that I ever
soId to that I became friends with.

1130
00:58:30,812 --> 00:58:34,714
They say, Iike, ''Don't dip the pen
in company ink.''

1131
00:58:34,883 --> 00:58:37,875
I'm totaIIy gIad
I dipped in your ink, bro.

1132
00:58:39,121 --> 00:58:40,611
Yeah.

1133
00:58:43,258 --> 00:58:45,886
We shouId get out of town.
That's probabIy our next move.

1134
00:58:46,061 --> 00:58:47,722
Just get on a bus and Ieave, right?

1135
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:49,927
Get bus tickets.

1136
00:58:50,098 --> 00:58:53,534
Go to the next town.
Contact some poIice.

1137
00:58:53,702 --> 00:58:55,966
You know what I was saying?
Like, I'm totaIIy--

1138
00:58:56,138 --> 00:58:58,072
You're gIad you dipped your pen
in my ink.

1139
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,435
But we shouId get bus tickets
and Ieave, right?

1140
00:59:00,609 --> 00:59:01,803
What?

1141
00:59:01,977 --> 00:59:05,105
Get on the bus? Leave?
Buy bus tickets?

1142
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,613
I onIy have, Iike, 50 bucks.
I don't think that'II even buy one ticket.

1143
00:59:09,184 --> 00:59:10,481
What about your sack?

1144
00:59:10,652 --> 00:59:13,519
Oh, man, it's fucking kiIIing me.
I feeI Iike I popped one.

1145
00:59:14,723 --> 00:59:17,658
No. That's unfortunate,
but that's not what I'm taIking about.

1146
00:59:17,826 --> 00:59:19,293
I mean, Iike, the sack of weed.

1147
00:59:19,461 --> 00:59:21,520
CouIdn't we just,
Iike, seII some weed...

1148
00:59:21,696 --> 00:59:23,357
...get some cash
and buy bus tickets?

1149
00:59:23,532 --> 00:59:27,559
-Of course, man. That's what I do.
-That's what you do. Fucking A.

1150
00:59:27,736 --> 00:59:28,470
Okay, so you're gonna buy tickets
for Saturday's game, right?

1151
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:30,529
Okay, so you're gonna buy tickets
for Saturday's game, right?

1152
00:59:30,705 --> 00:59:32,297
These guys are amazing.

1153
00:59:32,808 --> 00:59:34,173
What the fuck do you want?

1154
00:59:34,342 --> 00:59:36,503
You guys wanna buy some chronic?

1155
00:59:43,318 --> 00:59:44,785
What's this stuff caIIed again?

1156
00:59:44,953 --> 00:59:46,978
PineappIe Express.
They said it eight times.

1157
00:59:47,155 --> 00:59:50,352
-Yeah, but don't caII it that.
-Yeah, that's not what it's caIIed.

1158
00:59:50,525 --> 00:59:53,392
-CaII it Banana Boat.
-Make sure you Ieave it at weed too.

1159
00:59:53,562 --> 00:59:56,497
This can be a gateway drug.
Don't wanna move on to other things.

1160
00:59:56,665 --> 00:59:59,133
-Cocaine. Don't do that.
-We don't fuck around.

1161
00:59:59,301 --> 01:00:03,362
-Don't worry. Don't teII us what to do.
-InhaIe it, Chachi. InhaIe it.

1162
01:00:03,538 --> 01:00:04,937
Who the fuck's Chachi?

1163
01:00:22,858 --> 01:00:24,917
-How much money you guys got?
-Come on.

1164
01:00:25,093 --> 01:00:27,459
You each get as much
as you can grab with one hand.

1165
01:00:27,629 --> 01:00:29,927
Go easy. That's a big handfuI, guys.
Come on.

1166
01:00:30,098 --> 01:00:33,761
-Keep it on the down-Iow.
-Don't teII anybody where you got it.

1167
01:00:33,935 --> 01:00:38,099
You got it from SauI-- I mean, you got
it from Santiago and Dunbar.

1168
01:00:38,273 --> 01:00:41,106
-Go. Come on.
-Go, go. Vamoose!

1169
01:00:43,178 --> 01:00:44,270
You fucking did it, man.

1170
01:00:44,446 --> 01:00:47,108
You are a good saIesman.
You got it in you, man.

1171
01:00:47,282 --> 01:00:49,716
I'm about to go get some
ceIebratory SIushees.

1172
01:00:49,885 --> 01:00:51,375
Get some burritos or something.

1173
01:00:51,553 --> 01:00:53,521
Something to drink too.
Something good.

1174
01:00:53,688 --> 01:00:56,122
See you, man. Nice.

1175
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:05,731
Don't move. Don't you move.
This shit hurts.

1176
01:01:05,901 --> 01:01:07,493
Don't move. What's in your hand?

1177
01:01:07,669 --> 01:01:09,432
It's weed. It's a joint. It's a roach.

1178
01:01:09,604 --> 01:01:11,299
-Right here.
-I was just smoking--

1179
01:01:11,473 --> 01:01:13,998
I thought it was decriminaIized,
to be honest with you.

1180
01:01:14,176 --> 01:01:18,442
I have horribIe anorexia,
and it heIps my appetite. I'm so sorry.

1181
01:01:18,613 --> 01:01:23,380
Look, seIIing narcotics to my students
is not decriminaIized.

1182
01:01:23,552 --> 01:01:26,544
-Okay. I understand.
-I'm the Iiaison officer for this schooI.

1183
01:01:26,721 --> 01:01:29,815
And guess what? I just saw three
students waIking from back here...

1184
01:01:29,991 --> 01:01:33,324
...with their eyes as red
as the deviI's dick. You're busted.

1185
01:01:39,534 --> 01:01:41,399
-On the hood. On the hood.
-Okay, okay.

1186
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:43,299
I'm on the hood. Come on.

1187
01:01:43,471 --> 01:01:46,235
-Stand stiII. Stand stiII.
-I'm stiII. I'm sorry.

1188
01:01:46,408 --> 01:01:50,139
You better hope it's cIean.
Better hope ain't shit on this record.

1189
01:01:50,312 --> 01:01:53,145
I'm gonna put my foot
up in your ass.

1190
01:01:56,818 --> 01:01:59,286
Oh, big sexy with gIasses.

1191
01:02:01,556 --> 01:02:05,048
This is Officer Barbara. Requesting
an update on fugitive DaIe Denton.

1192
01:02:05,227 --> 01:02:09,755
I repeat, requesting update on DaIe
Denton. I have the fugitive in custody.

1193
01:02:09,931 --> 01:02:11,956

What? What do you mean--?
Why am I going down?

1196
01:02:17,205 --> 01:02:19,469

1197
01:02:19,641 --> 01:02:21,871
What did I teII you?
What did I teII you?

1198
01:02:22,043 --> 01:02:24,534
I wasn't doing things.
Why do you hate me so much?

1199
01:02:24,713 --> 01:02:27,147
Hit-and-run, Mr. Denton.
Hit-and-run.

1200
01:02:27,315 --> 01:02:28,782
Two parked cars, two nights ago.

1201
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:31,009
One of them was actuaIIy
a poIice cruiser.

1202
01:02:31,186 --> 01:02:34,053
You gotta be the dumbest
motherfucker in captivity.

1203
01:02:34,222 --> 01:02:37,089
It's the Iady cop.
They got DaIe. Oh, shit.

1204
01:02:37,259 --> 01:02:39,159
So you're teIIing me

1205
01:02:39,327 --> 01:02:41,090
...and a poIice officer

1206
01:02:41,263 --> 01:02:42,753
-ExactIy.
-And you saw it?

1207
01:02:42,931 --> 01:02:44,922
-Yes, do you beIieve me?
-Give me a minute.

1208
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:47,933
-It was a woman or a man?
-It was a poIicewoman. A woman.

1209
01:02:48,103 --> 01:02:53,006
-I think I know who that bitch was.
-Yes. I wiII identify that bitch.

1210
01:02:54,943 --> 01:02:57,377
Thank you so much for beIieving me,
ma'am. Thank you.

1211
01:02:57,545 --> 01:02:59,604
I'II teII you, I'II get to the bottom of it.

1212
01:02:59,781 --> 01:03:02,045
I'II take this badge off,
get to the bottom of it.

1213
01:03:02,217 --> 01:03:04,378
I don't work for the Iaw.
The Iaw works for me.

1214
01:03:04,552 --> 01:03:06,645
I been smeIIing something
in this department.

1215
01:03:06,821 --> 01:03:08,186
Keep your eyes on the road.

1216
01:03:08,356 --> 01:03:10,586
-Gonna get to the bottom of this shit.
-Stop!

1217
01:03:11,793 --> 01:03:13,158
Son of a bitch!

1218
01:03:13,328 --> 01:03:17,196
Oh, no. What the heII was that?
What is that?

1219
01:03:23,171 --> 01:03:26,937
No, no, no.

1220
01:03:27,108 --> 01:03:30,100
-No. What are you doing?
-I'm saving you, amigo!

1221
01:03:31,479 --> 01:03:33,538
Freeze, goddamn it!
Don't even think about it!

1222
01:03:33,715 --> 01:03:36,275
This is an oId-fashioned
escape mission, buddy.

1223
01:03:36,451 --> 01:03:38,248
Stop this car!

1224
01:03:41,856 --> 01:03:44,347
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1225
01:03:44,526 --> 01:03:45,959
Oh, shit!

1226
01:03:48,563 --> 01:03:51,532
Oh, shit! It's the Iady cop!
That's the murderer! Go!

1227
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,292
-That's the Iady cop.
-Who's that?

1228
01:03:53,468 --> 01:03:56,494
I don't know. They're shooting!

1229
01:04:02,444 --> 01:04:04,412
Oh, my God, they're shooting!

1230
01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:05,876
Fuck.

1231
01:04:10,852 --> 01:04:12,376
Dude!

1232
01:04:15,156 --> 01:04:16,714
I can't see! The SIushee!

1233
01:04:16,891 --> 01:04:19,052
-Turn on the wipers!
-It's not working!

1234
01:04:19,227 --> 01:04:20,888
WeII, kick out the window!

1235
01:04:21,062 --> 01:04:23,826
-How do you drive with one foot?
-I don't know!

1236
01:04:25,834 --> 01:04:27,699
Fuck! I think I puIIed my groin!

1237
01:04:31,106 --> 01:04:32,403
Get your foot out of there.

1238
01:04:33,141 --> 01:04:35,234
She's gaining on us.
She's behind us.

1239
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:36,468
Her car's better.

1240
01:04:36,644 --> 01:04:39,044
-Get your Ieg out of there. SeriousIy.
-I can't.

1241
01:04:39,214 --> 01:04:42,115
Put it into maximum overdrive!

1242
01:04:44,586 --> 01:04:46,679
Oh, no, no, no!

1243
01:04:48,723 --> 01:04:50,020
Oh, shit!

1244
01:04:50,191 --> 01:04:51,886
Get it out!

1245
01:04:54,329 --> 01:04:55,921
I can't see!

1246
01:05:01,302 --> 01:05:05,705
Danger! Danger!
Trees! Tree, tree! SquirreI!

1247
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:10,202
Hey, I can see
through my Ieg hoIe.

1248
01:05:10,378 --> 01:05:12,107
Nice! Look out! Tree, tree, tree!

1249
01:05:14,849 --> 01:05:16,749
You did it, man.

1250
01:05:18,052 --> 01:05:19,542
AII right! Look out!

1251
01:05:19,721 --> 01:05:21,780
Oh, shit!

1252
01:05:21,956 --> 01:05:24,390
Turn around! Turn around!

1253
01:05:32,634 --> 01:05:34,465
I'm scared, SauI. I'm scared.

1254
01:05:34,636 --> 01:05:36,968
-Don't worry. I'm handIing this.
-Do something.

1255
01:05:37,138 --> 01:05:39,402
AII right, hoId on. I got an idea.

1256
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:46,244
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1257
01:05:47,148 --> 01:05:48,638
Sorry!

1258
01:05:49,951 --> 01:05:51,543
What the fuck was that?

1259
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:53,949
Fuck. I'm sorry.
I thought she'd just go past.

1260
01:05:54,122 --> 01:05:56,022
-Why?
-I don't know.

1261
01:06:13,007 --> 01:06:14,497
Oh, my.

1262
01:06:19,013 --> 01:06:21,413
Yes! Yes! We made it!
AII right, man.

1263
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:24,279
-Let's get the fuck out of here.
-No. What are you doing?

1264
01:06:24,452 --> 01:06:27,216
You forgot me, you idiot!
Come back!

1265
01:06:27,388 --> 01:06:30,255
Come back! SauI!

1266
01:06:30,425 --> 01:06:31,790
-Sorry, man.
-Thank you.

1267
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:35,896
-Let's go.
-Wait. Get the handcuff keys, you idiot.

1268
01:06:37,999 --> 01:06:41,264
As soon as we kiII
those sacks of shit tonight, Ted...

1269
01:06:41,436 --> 01:06:43,165
...I'm moving on.

1270
01:06:47,442 --> 01:06:49,034
Okay.

1271
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:50,768
AII right.

1272
01:06:51,579 --> 01:06:55,037
And I promise you
you're gonna be taken care of.

1273
01:06:55,216 --> 01:06:56,478
As sure as shit you wiII.

1274
01:06:56,651 --> 01:06:58,448
For now, this is what
we're gonna do.

1275
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:02,112
We're gonna go to the farm tonight,
we're gonna move tonight's shipment.

1276
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:04,884
Then tomorrow morning,
we're gonna hunt these guys down.

1277
01:07:05,059 --> 01:07:07,550
DaIe, SauI, the Asians.
Every Iast one of them.

1278
01:07:07,729 --> 01:07:09,856
We're gonna fucking kiII them aII.

1279
01:07:10,365 --> 01:07:12,094
So smiIe.

1280
01:07:12,267 --> 01:07:13,825
Shut up.

1281
01:07:16,271 --> 01:07:20,605
Say something in Spanish.
Go ahead. I dare you. Go ahead.

1282
01:07:21,976 --> 01:07:23,773
AII right. Are you using protection?

1283
01:07:23,945 --> 01:07:25,003
-<i>Days Inn.</i>
-Yes.

1284
01:07:25,179 --> 01:07:27,044
May I have the GarageIy room,
pIease?

1285
01:07:27,882 --> 01:07:29,816
-HeIIo?
-<i>Hello, is Angie there?</i>

1286
01:07:29,984 --> 01:07:31,815
-DaIe.
-<i>Angie?</i>

1287
01:07:31,986 --> 01:07:34,682
-My God, are you okay?
-<i>I'm good. I'm fine. I'm great.</i>

1288
01:07:34,856 --> 01:07:36,187
-<i>Are you okay?</i>
-Yes, I'm fine.

1289
01:07:36,357 --> 01:07:37,949
<i>Okay, good. I came up with a plan.</i>

1290
01:07:38,126 --> 01:07:40,287
It might sound weird at first,
but just Iisten.

1291
01:07:40,461 --> 01:07:43,328
DaIe. You know what? Drug deaIers--
Let me teII you something.

1292
01:07:43,498 --> 01:07:48,401
Drug deaIers are trying to kiII me.
And you. And my famiIy.

1293
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:51,471
<i>I can't believe I'm in this situation</i>
<i>right now because of you...</i>

1294
01:07:51,639 --> 01:07:54,506
...and your addiction to marijuana.
I cannot beIieve I'm here.

1295
01:07:54,676 --> 01:07:56,200
<i>I can't be addicted to marijuana.</i>

1296
01:07:56,377 --> 01:07:59,540
A, I use a bong. It fiIters out
the addictive shit. SeriousIy.

1297
01:07:59,714 --> 01:08:02,581
<i>B, what does that have to do with</i>
<i>anything? I witnessed murder.</i>

1298
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,047
And now I'm deaIing with it.

1299
01:08:04,218 --> 01:08:06,709
This, that's happening between us,
this is normaI.

1300
01:08:06,888 --> 01:08:09,379
This happens to every coupIe
dating for three months.

1301
01:08:09,557 --> 01:08:11,047
-<i>We have to work through it.</i>
-No.

1302
01:08:11,225 --> 01:08:12,692
This doesn't happen to anyone.

1303
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:15,328
I shouId not be in this situation,
so fuck you.

1304
01:08:15,496 --> 01:08:16,793
<i>You know what? It's over.</i>

1305
01:08:16,965 --> 01:08:19,490
Good. Fine. Whatever. It's over.

1306
01:08:19,667 --> 01:08:23,000
CongratuIations. Had to happen
sometime, right? Why not now?

1307
01:08:23,171 --> 01:08:24,502
What the fuck does that mean?

1308
01:08:24,672 --> 01:08:27,300
<i>It means that you are gonna go</i>
<i>to college next year.</i>

1309
01:08:27,475 --> 01:08:29,568
<i>You'll get into</i>
<i>Godspeed You! Black Emperor...</i>

1310
01:08:29,744 --> 01:08:30,904
<i>...and the fucking Shins.</i>

1311
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:33,639
<i>And you'll blow a bunch of dudes</i>
<i>and become a lesbian...</i>

1312
01:08:33,815 --> 01:08:36,545
<i>...and I'll be here in fucking</i>
<i>Clark County doing shit-all.</i>

1313
01:08:36,718 --> 01:08:39,118
<i>You're gonna dump me.</i>
<i>So, fuck it, have a good time.</i>

1314
01:08:39,287 --> 01:08:41,380
A Iesbian? Fuck you, DaIe!

1315
01:08:41,556 --> 01:08:43,285
<i>You never did like me anyway,</i>
<i>did you?</i>

1316
01:08:43,458 --> 01:08:44,982
<i>You didn't wanna meet my parents.</i>

1317
01:08:45,159 --> 01:08:47,753
I aIways cared about you.
That's not what this is. Okay?

1318
01:08:47,929 --> 01:08:49,157
I aIways care about you.

1319
01:08:49,330 --> 01:08:51,161
Why don't you ever act Iike it, huh?

1320
01:08:51,332 --> 01:08:53,766
Why do you never act
Iike you care about anything?

1321
01:08:53,935 --> 01:08:58,065
Because I'm high! Fuck! And it--
What do you want--? Okay. Jesus.

1322
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,264
CaII me when I can go home.

1323
01:09:01,175 --> 01:09:05,669
You Iost it pIaying Bid Whist?
You pimp.

1324
01:09:05,847 --> 01:09:09,078
No, I'II give you more,
but you cannot gambIe with it.

1325
01:09:09,751 --> 01:09:11,946
I know, I'm sorry about the cIocks.

1326
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:16,250
I couIdn't remember if it was today
or tomorrow. AII right, I gotta go.

1327
01:09:16,424 --> 01:09:17,948
I Iove you.

1328
01:09:18,126 --> 01:09:20,287
You wise-ass.

1329
01:09:21,129 --> 01:09:23,893
Hey, you aII right, man?
That sounded pretty hectic.

1330
01:09:24,065 --> 01:09:26,465
I'm okay.
Let's just get the fuck out of here.

1331
01:09:26,634 --> 01:09:27,726
First things first.

1332
01:09:29,671 --> 01:09:33,107
-Don't do that, okay?
-Yeah. Why not?

1333
01:09:33,274 --> 01:09:35,435
Why not? Car chase, gunshots.

1334
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:37,043
That cIearIy just happened...

1335
01:09:37,211 --> 01:09:39,577
...because we were smoking
marijuana.

1336
01:09:39,747 --> 01:09:41,715
No, man. It happened
because those kids...

1337
01:09:41,883 --> 01:09:44,044
...couIdn't keep their shit
on the down-Iow.

1338
01:09:44,218 --> 01:09:47,085
In case you haven't noticed--
Which you haven't.

1339
01:09:47,255 --> 01:09:49,723
From what I can teII,
you don't notice anything ever.

1340
01:09:49,891 --> 01:09:53,258
--we are not very functionaI when
we're high. Which is aII the time.

1341
01:09:53,428 --> 01:09:56,158
WeII, I don't know, man.
I think I'm functioning right now.

1342
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:59,163
I was, Iike, stoned when I saved you
with those SIushees.

1343
01:09:59,333 --> 01:10:00,766
What do you gotta say to that?

1344
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:03,495
WeII, that wouId be true
if you had saved me.

1345
01:10:03,671 --> 01:10:04,797
But you didn't save me.

1346
01:10:04,972 --> 01:10:06,872
She was gonna heIp,
you made things worse.

1347
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:08,906
We're wanted
for aII sorts of crazy shit.

1348
01:10:09,077 --> 01:10:11,068
Don't fucking get on my case,
aII right?

1349
01:10:11,245 --> 01:10:12,906
OnIy reason I started seIIing pot...

1350
01:10:13,081 --> 01:10:15,675
...is so I couId put my <i>bubbe</i>
in a nice retirement home.

1351
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:18,011
-She must be proud of you.
-She is proud of me.

1352
01:10:18,186 --> 01:10:19,517
I'm gonna become something.

1353
01:10:19,687 --> 01:10:22,212
As soon as she dies,
I'm gonna become a civiI engineer.

1354
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:24,722
I'm gonna design septic tanks
for pIaygrounds.

1355
01:10:24,892 --> 01:10:26,382
LittIe kids can take shits.

1356
01:10:26,561 --> 01:10:28,188
You idiot. What the heII do you do?

1357
01:10:28,362 --> 01:10:30,455
What am I gonna do?
Besides stay in my home...

1358
01:10:30,631 --> 01:10:33,191
...for fear that you've designed
some object I'm around?

1359
01:10:33,367 --> 01:10:36,564
I'm gonna be on the radio,
taIking about Iife.

1360
01:10:36,738 --> 01:10:39,172
-Giving Iessons about Iife.
-Put me in my pIace.

1361
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,831
I'm gonna be designing buiIdings
and what's he doing?

1362
01:10:42,009 --> 01:10:43,840
Boring peopIe to death on the radio.

1363
01:10:44,011 --> 01:10:47,606
You are an asshoIe.
That's aII you are. You're an asshoIe.

1364
01:10:47,782 --> 01:10:49,647
-I'm not an asshoIe.
-You are an asshoIe.

1365
01:10:49,817 --> 01:10:52,786
I feeI pretty sure
that I'm not an asshoIe.

1366
01:10:52,954 --> 01:10:54,581
I'm, Iike, a totaIIy nice guy.

1367
01:10:54,756 --> 01:10:57,247
I'm just as nice as you are.
So don't bring that out.

1368
01:10:57,425 --> 01:10:59,222
In the woods, I gave you my jacket.

1369
01:10:59,393 --> 01:11:01,725
You were coId and I cIothed you.

1370
01:11:02,196 --> 01:11:05,495
How about in the park
when I said that you were my friend?

1371
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:07,293
You didn't say anything back.

1372
01:11:07,468 --> 01:11:10,028
WeII, that's easy.
It's because we're not friends.

1373
01:11:10,204 --> 01:11:11,671
You are my drug deaIer.

1374
01:11:11,839 --> 01:11:13,568
There's one reason
we know each other.

1375
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:15,766
I Iike the drugs you seII. That's it.

1376
01:11:15,943 --> 01:11:19,174
If you didn't seII those drugs,
I wouId have no idea who you were...

1377
01:11:19,347 --> 01:11:22,475
...and I wouId be fantastic right now.
Instead of Iooking Iike this.

1378
01:11:24,452 --> 01:11:27,444
That sounded mean.
Just hearing it sounded mean.

1379
01:11:27,622 --> 01:11:29,180
-I didn't mean to say--
-It's out.

1380
01:11:29,357 --> 01:11:31,791
Monkey's out of the bottIe, man.

1381
01:11:31,959 --> 01:11:33,984
What? That's not even
an expression.

1382
01:11:34,162 --> 01:11:36,892
Pandora doesn't go back in the box.
He onIy comes out.

1383
01:11:37,064 --> 01:11:38,929
I'm sorry, man. Look--

1384
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,892
-What are you doing?
-Here. Have a nice Iast meaI.

1385
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:45,630
Come on, man. Don't do that.

1386
01:11:45,807 --> 01:11:47,900
Why don't you supersize it, bitch?

1387
01:11:48,075 --> 01:11:50,475
I'm sorry, man. Look, come back.

1388
01:11:50,645 --> 01:11:52,875
I didn't mean that.

1389
01:12:05,293 --> 01:12:08,057
<i>I love you. Do you love me?</i>

1390
01:12:51,038 --> 01:12:52,665
That Iooks great.

1391
01:13:00,314 --> 01:13:01,747
HeIIo?

1392
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:04,147
DaIe?

1393
01:13:04,318 --> 01:13:05,683
<i>It is Dale.</i>

1394
01:13:05,853 --> 01:13:10,722
Angie, I'm caIIing because I Iove you
more than anything in the worId...

1395
01:13:10,892 --> 01:13:14,328
...and I wanna Iet you know
I'II do anything to make it work.

1396
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,224
<i>I'll do anything.</i>

1397
01:13:16,397 --> 01:13:19,992
I've had a near-death experience,
and when that happens...

1398
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:22,863
...you can prioritize your Iife,
and you are it, okay?

1399
01:13:23,037 --> 01:13:25,198
<i>So please</i>
<i>just take me back, please.</i>

1400
01:13:25,373 --> 01:13:27,466
-<i>I love you.</i>
-I Iove you.

1401
01:13:28,843 --> 01:13:31,778
-Yeah?
-<i>I just don't wanna lose you, Dale.</i>

1402
01:13:31,946 --> 01:13:35,404
We were driving away from the house
and I just kept thinking--

1403
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:36,811
I don't know. I just--

1404
01:13:36,984 --> 01:13:38,383
I wanna marry you.

1405
01:13:41,489 --> 01:13:43,150
I made a mistake.

1406
01:13:43,324 --> 01:13:45,656
-<i>What do you mean?</i>
-I've....

1407
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:48,460
-What?
-<i>I'm just processing that last bit.</i>

1408
01:13:48,629 --> 01:13:51,223
-<i>You wanna</i>-- <i>Oh, fuck.</i>
-What?

1409
01:13:51,399 --> 01:13:52,957
I don't know.

1410
01:13:53,134 --> 01:13:55,261
I reaIize now
that if you wouId take me back...

1411
01:13:55,436 --> 01:13:57,370
...then you are very naive
and immature.

1412
01:13:57,538 --> 01:14:01,099
You don't see what a fuck-up I am.
I'm in no shape to be dated by anyone.

1413
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:04,403
-You're the one that's immature.
-<i>I'm not immature. You're immature.</i>

1414
01:14:04,578 --> 01:14:07,775
<i>I am somewhat immature,</i>
<i>but you're more immature. I'm older.</i>

1415
01:14:07,949 --> 01:14:09,246
Just because you're oIder.

1416
01:14:09,417 --> 01:14:11,942
I Iost my virginity
when I was 1 4 years oId.

1417
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:14,280
-<i>Really?</i>
-How many girIs have you sIept with?

1418
01:14:14,455 --> 01:14:16,548
-Like, two and a haIf.
-<i>Two and a half?</i>

1419
01:14:16,724 --> 01:14:17,918
What is a haIf? Your hand?

1420
01:14:18,092 --> 01:14:21,027
<i>No, it was the tip or I dipped a ball in.</i>
<i>I can't remember why.</i>

1421
01:14:21,195 --> 01:14:23,857
<i>I remember thinking,</i>
<i>''This doesn't count as a full point. ''</i>

1422
01:14:24,031 --> 01:14:26,397
<i>If I said three, I'd feel like a liar.</i>
<i>I was drunk.</i>

1423
01:14:26,567 --> 01:14:27,898
<i>Screw you.</i>

1424
01:14:28,069 --> 01:14:29,229
Get me out of this room.

1425
01:14:29,403 --> 01:14:32,463
<i>I will, and that's the last</i>
<i>you'll ever hear from me, okay?</i>

1426
01:14:34,642 --> 01:14:38,442
Oh, thank goodness. Okay.

1427
01:14:41,649 --> 01:14:43,947
BeIogus. Faye BeIogus.

1428
01:14:45,386 --> 01:14:46,683
Lookit there. Lookit there.

1429
01:14:46,854 --> 01:14:48,685
Do you use the pooI over here?

1430
01:14:48,856 --> 01:14:51,620
Yes, I use the pooI. Come on,
what do you want from me?

1431
01:14:51,792 --> 01:14:54,989
Your grandson. We need you to get
on the phone with your grandson--

1432
01:14:55,162 --> 01:14:57,096
What are you taIking about,
my grandson?

1433
01:14:57,264 --> 01:14:59,994
You toId me you wanna sit down,
pIay dominos with me.

1434
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:02,158
And now you're hocking me
about my grandson.

1435
01:15:02,336 --> 01:15:04,998
-Is that Yiddish?
-Yes. Yes, it is.

1436
01:15:05,172 --> 01:15:06,298
May I caII you Faye?

1437
01:15:06,474 --> 01:15:09,602
You can caII me Faye,
but I'm gonna caII you a stinker.

1438
01:15:09,777 --> 01:15:11,301
Hey, Mrs. MendeIson.

1439
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:13,003
What do you want from me?

1440
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,545
<i>Bubbe.</i> Hey, guys.

1441
01:15:14,715 --> 01:15:17,206
-WeII, Iook who it is.
-HeIIo, baby.

1442
01:15:21,322 --> 01:15:22,346
Damn.

1443
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:24,621
Oh, shit.

1444
01:15:24,792 --> 01:15:26,384
Sorry, Betty.

1445
01:15:30,798 --> 01:15:33,164
They kidnapped my grandson.

1446
01:15:33,334 --> 01:15:35,234
Yeah, these two guys came in...

1447
01:15:35,403 --> 01:15:38,395
...they sat down with me
to pIay dominos.

1448
01:15:38,572 --> 01:15:40,665
I never saw them in my Iife before.

1449
01:15:40,841 --> 01:15:44,004
And they kept asking questions
about my grandson.

1450
01:15:44,178 --> 01:15:48,638
-What did they Iook Iike?
-One of them was very taII and sIoppy.

1451
01:15:48,816 --> 01:15:52,582
And the other guy,
he was very good-Iooking...

1452
01:15:52,753 --> 01:15:54,084
...but he was short as shit.

1453
01:15:54,255 --> 01:15:56,189
But the worst part was...

1454
01:15:56,357 --> 01:16:00,726
...that my grandson came in,
why, and in pajamas.

1455
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,886
-You gotta find my grandson.
-Do the best--

1456
01:16:03,064 --> 01:16:04,326
-Do you promise?
-I promise.

1457
01:16:04,498 --> 01:16:06,363
AbsoIuteIy.
You've got something there.

1458
01:16:06,534 --> 01:16:08,058
I beIieve that's a moIe, ma'am.

1459
01:16:13,741 --> 01:16:16,938
You sack of shit. Do you know
what a pain in the ass you've been?

1460
01:16:17,111 --> 01:16:18,874
No, man. I don't wanna get out.

1461
01:16:19,046 --> 01:16:21,879
Who gave you that IoIIipop?
Let's go.

1462
01:16:22,049 --> 01:16:24,244
Where am I, man? What?

1463
01:16:24,418 --> 01:16:27,876
You guys started it, man.
I don't even wanna be here.

1464
01:16:28,055 --> 01:16:29,386
Shit. Did I do that?

1465
01:16:31,058 --> 01:16:34,050
Hey, hey. AII right, okay.

1466
01:16:34,695 --> 01:16:36,560
Fuck you, man!

1467
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:39,426
-Stand back. Ted wants him aIive.
-Why you hoIding me back?

1468
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:40,931
Ted wants him aIive, okay?

1469
01:16:41,102 --> 01:16:43,093
I shouId be kicking
his fucking teeth in.

1470
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:46,671
-If anybody's gonna beat him, it's Ted.
-I Iook Iike HamburgIar.

1471
01:16:46,841 --> 01:16:47,865
And the EIephant Man.

1472
01:16:48,042 --> 01:16:50,237
Like someone fucked you up
with a coffee pot.

1473
01:16:50,411 --> 01:16:52,140
ProfessionaI. ProfessionaI.

1474
01:16:52,313 --> 01:16:54,440
-ProfessionaI on this, bitch.
-Whatever, man.

1475
01:16:54,615 --> 01:16:56,742
-Where were you?
-I was there.

1476
01:16:56,917 --> 01:16:58,782
-Supposed to be my partner.
-I was there.

1477
01:16:58,953 --> 01:17:00,614
No, you wasn't.
How did this happen?

1478
01:17:00,788 --> 01:17:02,983
I take the hit?
That's how it's gonna be?

1479
01:17:03,157 --> 01:17:05,557
Fuck aII this, you know?
Get him out of here.

1480
01:17:05,726 --> 01:17:08,957
Take him downstairs.
Get this asshoIe out of my sight.

1481
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:11,291
I don't wanna go near this guy.

1482
01:17:11,465 --> 01:17:14,434
What's down there?
Fucking rancor?

1483
01:17:14,602 --> 01:17:16,229
I might act tough...

1484
01:17:16,403 --> 01:17:18,462
...but I got a Iot of feeIings.

1485
01:17:18,873 --> 01:17:21,774
And you hurt damn near
every one of them.

1486
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:24,505
This ain't over.

1487
01:17:24,979 --> 01:17:26,844
-You know you gonna die, right?
-Yeah.

1488
01:17:27,014 --> 01:17:29,073
I'm gonna kiII the fuck out of you.

1489
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:32,515
I hope you enjoy these Iast
1 7 minutes of your Iife...

1490
01:17:32,686 --> 01:17:34,950
...because when Ted gets here,
he's gonna be Iike:

1491
01:17:35,122 --> 01:17:38,182
''KiII that motherfucker.''
I'm gonna kiII your motherfucking ass.

1492
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:39,383
Watch your head.

1493
01:17:41,328 --> 01:17:43,125
Hey, watch him.

1494
01:17:44,965 --> 01:17:46,193
Oh, my God.

1495
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:48,699
EI Dorado.

1496
01:17:49,036 --> 01:17:51,266
The Iegends are true.

1497
01:17:51,872 --> 01:17:54,067
Look at aII this weed, man.

1498
01:17:54,241 --> 01:17:55,970
What's that? PurpIe Granddaddy?

1499
01:17:56,143 --> 01:17:58,509
-Come on.
-PurpIe NurpIe?

1500
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:00,476
OG Kush?

1501
01:18:00,648 --> 01:18:01,979
OG Kush.

1502
01:18:09,156 --> 01:18:11,784
It's the most beautifuI thing
I've ever seen.

1503
01:18:11,959 --> 01:18:13,620
-What kind of irrigation--?
-Shut up.

1504
01:18:13,794 --> 01:18:15,694
-Can I touch it?
-Come here.

1505
01:18:31,078 --> 01:18:32,875
HeIIo?

1506
01:18:33,047 --> 01:18:34,446
Red?

1507
01:18:40,621 --> 01:18:42,521
-Red?
-What the fuck?

1508
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:45,488
Get out of here, man.
I didn't do shit, Denton.

1509
01:18:45,659 --> 01:18:48,753
Look, I come in peace, okay?
I'm not here to fight you again.

1510
01:18:48,929 --> 01:18:50,362
Good.

1511
01:18:50,531 --> 01:18:53,261
Because I'm tired, man.
Not feeIing so hot.

1512
01:18:53,434 --> 01:18:55,299
You don't Iook great.

1513
01:18:55,469 --> 01:18:56,993
They shot me, Denton.

1514
01:18:57,171 --> 01:18:58,468
They got me right here.

1515
01:18:58,639 --> 01:18:59,970
-Yeah?
-Right here.

1516
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:01,937
And then they got me again
right here.

1517
01:19:02,109 --> 01:19:05,340
Look, man, I'II caII 91 1 right now.

1518
01:19:05,512 --> 01:19:07,036
They'II save your Iife, okay?

1519
01:19:07,214 --> 01:19:09,114
-You don't need to die.
-No, bro.

1520
01:19:09,283 --> 01:19:11,911
You don't get it.
It doesn't reaIIy matter where I'm at.

1521
01:19:12,086 --> 01:19:14,350
If I'm at the hospitaI, if I'm here...

1522
01:19:14,521 --> 01:19:16,614
...Ted's gonna find me, man.
He wiII.

1523
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:19,725
And when he does,
he's gonna fucking kiII me.

1524
01:19:19,893 --> 01:19:21,520
He's just, Iike, an asshoIe.

1525
01:19:21,695 --> 01:19:24,630
I couIdn't agree more, Red.
That's why I've come here, okay?

1526
01:19:24,798 --> 01:19:26,663
You know Ted? He took SauI.

1527
01:19:26,834 --> 01:19:28,199
And I'm gonna get him back.

1528
01:19:28,369 --> 01:19:30,360
You know, Iike, he saved my Iife.

1529
01:19:30,537 --> 01:19:33,665
We've been on the run together.
He's a great friend. A good guy.

1530
01:19:33,841 --> 01:19:36,674
He is. I'II teII you that, man.
SauI is a good dude.

1531
01:19:36,844 --> 01:19:37,902
I was mean to him, man.

1532
01:19:38,078 --> 01:19:40,808
I wronged him and I can't--
I can't Iet it end Iike that.

1533
01:19:40,981 --> 01:19:44,644
I'm just into Buddhism
and I'm at peace with the fact...

1534
01:19:44,818 --> 01:19:48,720
...that me as this person,
probabIy gonna not be around.

1535
01:19:48,889 --> 01:19:50,823
Think about a hermit crab, okay?

1536
01:19:50,991 --> 01:19:54,950
And it's a sheII, and it's Iike
they go from one sheII to the next.

1537
01:19:55,129 --> 01:19:59,259
And that's what I am. It's Iike
I'm just a hermit crab changing sheIIs.

1538
01:19:59,433 --> 01:20:01,799
Except, if you're a dick
your whoIe Iife...

1539
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:04,836
...your next sheII
wiII be made of shit, okay?

1540
01:20:05,005 --> 01:20:07,769
If you're an asshoIe, you're gonna
come back as a cockroach.

1541
01:20:07,941 --> 01:20:11,672
Or a worm,
or a fucking anaI bead, okay?

1542
01:20:11,845 --> 01:20:14,245
If you're a man,
and you act heroic...

1543
01:20:14,415 --> 01:20:15,973
...you'II come back as an eagIe.

1544
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:17,708
You'II come back as a dragon.

1545
01:20:17,885 --> 01:20:19,546
You'II come back as Jude Law.

1546
01:20:20,354 --> 01:20:22,549
Okay? Which wouId you rather be?

1547
01:20:22,723 --> 01:20:26,056
Maybe the anaI bead. Might--
Depending on who it beIongs to.

1548
01:20:26,226 --> 01:20:27,250
It beIongs to me.

1549
01:20:27,428 --> 01:20:28,861
-Then the dragon.
-ExactIy.

1550
01:20:29,029 --> 01:20:32,863
You need to heIp me, okay?
Just use it, you know? Use the pain.

1551
01:20:33,033 --> 01:20:34,261
You'II have a second wind.

1552
01:20:34,435 --> 01:20:36,835
Let's get up
and go get SauI back. Use it.

1553
01:20:37,004 --> 01:20:39,666
-Aren't you angry at Ted?
-Yeah, I'm reaIIy mad at him.

1554
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,003
What do you wanna do? Don't you
wanna get up, do something about it?

1555
01:20:43,177 --> 01:20:45,475
Maybe that wouId be cooI
to do to him.

1556
01:20:45,646 --> 01:20:47,307
I don't think ''maybe'' is the answer.

1557
01:20:47,481 --> 01:20:49,779
I think, ''Yes, I'm gonna
heIp you, DaIe''...

1558
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:51,713
...that's the answer I'm Iooking for.

1559
01:20:53,354 --> 01:20:54,719
Come here.

1560
01:20:57,925 --> 01:21:01,622
Ted Jones messed
with the wrong meIon farmers.

1561
01:21:04,098 --> 01:21:06,157
Thug Iife.

1562
01:21:12,139 --> 01:21:13,367
Oh, shit.

1563
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:16,270
Get those. I don't wanna
run them over in the vacuum...

1564
01:21:16,443 --> 01:21:18,502
-...and shoot my face off, okay?
-I'm sorry.

1565
01:21:25,486 --> 01:21:28,182
I used to use this IittIe gun
when I was a prostitute.

1566
01:21:33,193 --> 01:21:35,093
Don't.

1567
01:21:35,262 --> 01:21:36,286
Don't.

1568
01:21:36,463 --> 01:21:38,124
Just something quick Iike that.

1569
01:21:38,298 --> 01:21:39,788
-Don't.
-Yeah.

1570
01:21:39,967 --> 01:21:42,094
-Don't. You stop it right now.
-Stop it.

1571
01:21:55,382 --> 01:21:57,213
Oh, God.

1572
01:21:59,887 --> 01:22:01,946
That's a big hideout.

1573
01:22:03,891 --> 01:22:05,916
I can't do this. I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

1574
01:22:06,093 --> 01:22:09,062
I'm infected. My shit's aII fucked up.
I need medicaI attention.

1575
01:22:09,229 --> 01:22:12,130
What? I thought we just got aII
pumped up. What was that about?

1576
01:22:12,299 --> 01:22:14,733
Ted is a fucking murderer.
I can't fuck with him.

1577
01:22:14,902 --> 01:22:16,995
I got a wife.
She's gonna be out of jaiI soon.

1578
01:22:17,171 --> 01:22:20,072
I wanna fuck her. I am not gonna
wake up murdered tomorrow.

1579
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:22,401
Oh, man, no.
This is Iame of you, man.

1580
01:22:22,576 --> 01:22:24,942
Come on. This couId be
your moment of redemption.

1581
01:22:25,112 --> 01:22:26,306
This couId be your moment.

1582
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,040
I don't want a moment.
I don't want-- Fine, go.

1583
01:22:29,216 --> 01:22:30,240
Fuck you.

1584
01:22:30,417 --> 01:22:32,578
PIease come back for me.
PIease come back.

1585
01:22:32,753 --> 01:22:36,951
Legends never die, dude.
I'II teII your story.

1586
01:22:37,658 --> 01:22:40,525
CaroI, she's cooI now.

1587
01:22:40,694 --> 01:22:44,630
CaroI used to be a IittIe crazy, man.
She used to throw tickIe parties.

1588
01:22:44,798 --> 01:22:47,096
-Sounds Iike home-cooking to me.
-That was fun.

1589
01:22:47,267 --> 01:22:49,667
Game over, motherfuckers!
Everybody freeze!

1590
01:22:49,837 --> 01:22:52,135
TeII me where my friend is
or this guy gets it!

1591
01:22:52,306 --> 01:22:54,536
AII right, everybody be cooI, man.
Be cooI.

1592
01:22:54,708 --> 01:22:56,232
Put your guns down.
Nobody shoots.

1593
01:22:56,410 --> 01:22:58,002
Put them down. On the ground.

1594
01:22:58,178 --> 01:23:00,544
AII right, everybody just chiII.

1595
01:23:00,714 --> 01:23:02,614
Oh, my God!

1596
01:23:02,783 --> 01:23:04,444
-You shot him.
-Put the gun down.

1597
01:23:04,618 --> 01:23:07,143
-Drop the fucking gun.
-Don't shoot me!

1598
01:23:07,321 --> 01:23:09,619
-HoIy shit.
-I said, nobody shoot. You shot Pete.

1599
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:11,587
That's right. I shot him. I shot him.

1600
01:23:11,758 --> 01:23:14,488
I shot him. I don't have time
for a fucking negotiation.

1601
01:23:14,661 --> 01:23:17,152
Now, I wanna finish this off
so I can go home...

1602
01:23:17,331 --> 01:23:19,265
...and have dinner
with my wife for once.

1603
01:23:19,433 --> 01:23:21,560
If anybody asks, Denton kiIIed Pete.

1604
01:23:21,735 --> 01:23:23,532
End of story.

1605
01:23:23,704 --> 01:23:25,729
I'm teIIing Ted.

1606
01:23:25,906 --> 01:23:27,669
-If you do--
-He's got a piece.

1607
01:23:27,841 --> 01:23:29,433
-Motherfucker.
-Okay, I'm sorry.

1608
01:23:29,610 --> 01:23:31,271
He's got another one, in the side.

1609
01:23:31,445 --> 01:23:33,037
Damn it. I got one more on my Ieg.

1610
01:23:33,213 --> 01:23:35,477
There's one more.
I know you'II find it. Take it.

1611
01:23:35,649 --> 01:23:37,810
I'm sorry, guys.
Sorry I deceived you.

1612
01:23:37,985 --> 01:23:39,213
No. Come on.

1613
01:23:42,289 --> 01:23:44,757
-Oh, great.
-SauI.

1614
01:23:44,925 --> 01:23:46,017
-DaIe.
-Yes.

1615
01:23:46,193 --> 01:23:49,356
What did you do, rat me out?
Is that what you did, you bastard?

1616
01:23:49,530 --> 01:23:51,395
-No, man.
-Yes.

1617
01:23:51,565 --> 01:23:53,260
I'm here to save you.

1618
01:23:53,433 --> 01:23:56,095
No. You just got caught too.

1619
01:23:56,270 --> 01:23:58,636
And I'm gonna die in here
with some asshoIe.

1620
01:23:58,805 --> 01:24:00,864
Okay, you know what?
I deserved that.

1621
01:24:01,041 --> 01:24:03,874
I'II take that because
I have been an asshoIe, man.

1622
01:24:04,044 --> 01:24:07,207
This whoIe thing is my fauIt.
I ruined your Iife.

1623
01:24:07,614 --> 01:24:10,583
Okay? And I know there's no way...

1624
01:24:10,751 --> 01:24:13,185
...to make that up to you
except by saving your Iife.

1625
01:24:13,353 --> 01:24:16,413
So that's what I came here to do.
I'm here to save my best friend.

1626
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:19,115
Because that's what you are.
You're my best friend.

1627
01:24:19,293 --> 01:24:21,022
You're a mean jerk.

1628
01:24:21,194 --> 01:24:24,163
I was mean.
I was mean because, I think--

1629
01:24:24,331 --> 01:24:26,561
I didn't want
you to be my best friend.

1630
01:24:26,733 --> 01:24:29,429
I didn't wanna think
that that's what my Iife was.

1631
01:24:29,603 --> 01:24:32,071
Now I reaIize I'm Iucky
to have you as my best friend.

1632
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:33,729
You're the best guy I know.

1633
01:24:34,441 --> 01:24:35,738
BFFF.

1634
01:24:35,909 --> 01:24:38,343
Best fucking friends forever, man.

1635
01:24:41,682 --> 01:24:43,877
-AII right. Give me a hug.
-Yeah. Okay.

1636
01:24:44,051 --> 01:24:46,451
Thanks, man.
I'm so sorry about everything.

1637
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:47,951
Oh, I'm such a dick.

1638
01:24:48,121 --> 01:24:51,284
-Okay. I'm gonna get us out.
-No, you're not, but it's okay.

1639
01:24:51,458 --> 01:24:54,359
These guys are gonna fucking kiII us.
We gotta get out of here.

1640
01:24:54,528 --> 01:24:56,257
-I know. They are.
-Fuck, man.

1641
01:24:56,430 --> 01:25:00,764
We can hear you outside and
it's very fucking annoying, aII right?

1642
01:25:00,934 --> 01:25:03,494
-Okay. Sorry about that, sir.
-Shut the fuck up.

1643
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:05,797
Do you know
what ''shut the fuck up'' mean?

1644
01:25:05,973 --> 01:25:07,463
I do.

1645
01:25:07,641 --> 01:25:09,438
Shit. Stupid motherfuckers.

1646
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:13,543
Yes. Okay. I got an idea. I got an idea.
My beIt buckIe. My beIt buckIe.

1647
01:25:13,714 --> 01:25:17,172
Right here. Okay? Rub your wrists
against my beIt buckIe. That'II do it.

1648
01:25:18,552 --> 01:25:20,144
-Is it working?
-I can't feeI it.

1649
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,344
I can't feeI you.

1650
01:25:21,521 --> 01:25:23,455
-Wait, I feeI it.
-I feeI it. Yes, okay.

1651
01:25:23,624 --> 01:25:25,023
-Okay.
-Okay. Okay.

1652
01:25:25,192 --> 01:25:27,285
-I'm gonna save you, man.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1653
01:25:27,461 --> 01:25:29,224
-Let me save you.
-Save me, DaIe.

1654
01:25:29,396 --> 01:25:31,261
It's not working.
We gotta change angIes.

1655
01:25:31,431 --> 01:25:33,661
We gotta
get more Ieverage-y. Okay.

1656
01:25:33,834 --> 01:25:35,324
Okay, that's good. That's good.

1657
01:25:35,502 --> 01:25:37,436
Get your hands up on it.
There we go.

1658
01:25:37,604 --> 01:25:39,697
-AII right. AII right.
-Yeah. Okay.

1659
01:25:40,807 --> 01:25:42,934
-Yes. Yes.
-Okay.

1660
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:45,510
I'm gonna save you, man.
I'm gonna save you.

1661
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:47,977
-You're my best friend, man.
-Yeah, see?

1662
01:25:48,148 --> 01:25:51,242
-It's not working.
-Let me use my-- I'II use my mouth.

1663
01:25:51,418 --> 01:25:53,386
Finish it off with my mouth, paI.
Let's go.

1664
01:25:53,553 --> 01:25:55,646
Come on. Let's go.

1665
01:25:55,822 --> 01:25:57,687
Harder.

1666
01:26:06,299 --> 01:26:08,699
-Where are these fuckers?
-We got them downstairs.

1667
01:26:08,869 --> 01:26:11,565
-Where did you find them?
-Found SauI at his grandmother's.

1668
01:26:11,738 --> 01:26:14,639
He fucked up Matheson's face.
Hit him with a pot of hot coffee.

1669
01:26:14,808 --> 01:26:16,241
It's gross.

1670
01:26:16,410 --> 01:26:18,674
DaIe Denton comes fIying in here
Iike a madman...

1671
01:26:18,845 --> 01:26:22,645
...armed to the teeth, and,
as you can see, he shot Peter.

1672
01:26:22,816 --> 01:26:25,011
PIugged him, just whacked him.

1673
01:26:25,185 --> 01:26:28,416
Now they're both disarmed
and they're downstairs.

1674
01:26:28,588 --> 01:26:30,146
He shot Pete?

1675
01:26:30,323 --> 01:26:32,314
Fucking Pete? He was ex-CIA.

1676
01:26:32,492 --> 01:26:35,017
Who the fuck is this DaIe Denton?

1677
01:26:35,195 --> 01:26:38,494
Who is he? Where did he come from?
I do not know.

1678
01:26:43,036 --> 01:26:45,095
Time to cook shit up tonight.

1679
01:26:45,272 --> 01:26:47,297
Take his stash and burn
this motherfucker down.

1680
01:26:48,675 --> 01:26:50,575
Stop. Wait here.

1681
01:26:50,744 --> 01:26:53,508
No retreat, no surrender.

1682
01:26:58,985 --> 01:27:00,009
Yes, yes, yes.

1683
01:27:00,187 --> 01:27:03,020
-Wait, someone's coming.
-Okay, okay, okay.

1684
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:06,591
If I cough once, I'II take the Iead.
If I cough twice, you go, okay?

1685
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,955
WeII-- I cough sometimes for reaI.

1686
01:27:09,129 --> 01:27:11,029
Just don't. Don't--

1687
01:27:16,636 --> 01:27:19,696
Yo, Iook. I'm gonna say this
one time.

1688
01:27:19,873 --> 01:27:23,969
Whatever you're doing,
I get it, okay?

1689
01:27:24,144 --> 01:27:25,634
Stop.

1690
01:27:29,015 --> 01:27:31,575
See, I don't think
you understood me.

1691
01:27:31,752 --> 01:27:33,583
I can hear everything you're saying.

1692
01:27:33,754 --> 01:27:36,450
One cough mean you go.
Two cough mean you take the Iead.

1693
01:27:36,623 --> 01:27:39,114
The beIt buckIe.
Best friends forever.

1694
01:27:39,292 --> 01:27:41,556
Y'aII fuck on your own time, man.

1695
01:27:41,728 --> 01:27:43,286
Sorry, man. It was a stupid pIan.

1696
01:27:43,463 --> 01:27:45,897
What the fuck is that?

1697
01:27:48,201 --> 01:27:49,225
DaIe!

1698
01:27:53,373 --> 01:27:56,774
I've been waiting for this.
You burned my face!

1699
01:27:59,079 --> 01:28:01,411
I'm gonna tear this ass up.

1700
01:28:07,921 --> 01:28:09,411
You shot me.

1701
01:28:09,589 --> 01:28:10,954
I'm sorry, man.

1702
01:28:11,124 --> 01:28:14,821
I've never been shot.
Damn, that hurt.

1703
01:28:14,995 --> 01:28:16,622
I got gIass in my ass.

1704
01:28:16,797 --> 01:28:19,391
-DaIe. DaIe!
-This is messed up.

1705
01:28:19,566 --> 01:28:21,659
Has anyone seen my bigger knife?

1706
01:28:24,004 --> 01:28:26,063
Asians!

1707
01:28:31,077 --> 01:28:32,044
War is upon you!

1708
01:28:32,212 --> 01:28:34,009
Prepare to suck the cock of karma!

1709
01:28:40,187 --> 01:28:41,279
Get down, motherfucker!

1710
01:28:45,826 --> 01:28:47,054
Come on!

1711
01:28:49,763 --> 01:28:50,991
Fuck!

1712
01:29:00,407 --> 01:29:01,738
Go! Go!

1713
01:29:01,908 --> 01:29:03,068
Get down, baby!

1714
01:29:03,243 --> 01:29:04,972
DaIe, no!

1715
01:29:05,145 --> 01:29:06,772
No, wake up, man.

1716
01:29:06,947 --> 01:29:08,812
No, you're not dying, man.

1717
01:29:08,982 --> 01:29:11,542
Not without me.

1718
01:29:11,718 --> 01:29:13,049
-DaIe.
-What?

1719
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:15,051
You're aIive.

1720
01:29:15,222 --> 01:29:18,749
-You're-- You're aIive.
-What happened?

1721
01:29:19,326 --> 01:29:21,385
-He got your ear, man.
-He got my what?

1722
01:29:21,561 --> 01:29:24,291
-He got your ear.
-Fuck!

1723
01:29:25,432 --> 01:29:27,059
Fuck!

1724
01:29:29,336 --> 01:29:30,826
-HeIp!
-My ear.

1725
01:29:31,004 --> 01:29:32,028
-Yeah.
-HeIp!

1726
01:29:32,205 --> 01:29:34,298
-You kiIIed my ear.
-You shot me.

1727
01:29:34,474 --> 01:29:36,374
-I didn't do that.
-He shot me.

1728
01:29:36,543 --> 01:29:37,567
You shot him?

1729
01:29:37,744 --> 01:29:39,974
-Get your hands off of me.
-Shut up.

1730
01:29:40,146 --> 01:29:41,773
We've had enough out of you.

1731
01:29:41,948 --> 01:29:43,176
I'm not your friend.

1732
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:44,715
Maybe I can just--

1733
01:29:44,885 --> 01:29:46,876
No. No, infected.

1734
01:29:47,053 --> 01:29:49,453
Is that it? Maybe if we just hoId it.

1735
01:30:23,957 --> 01:30:25,618
It's cIear.

1736
01:30:26,559 --> 01:30:28,891
Dude. Look.

1737
01:30:29,062 --> 01:30:30,620
Nice.

1738
01:30:42,976 --> 01:30:44,500
BuIIets.

1739
01:30:52,652 --> 01:30:55,485
So seriousIy,
how gross does my ear Iook?

1740
01:30:55,655 --> 01:30:58,988
Is it reaIIy disgusting
or is it, Iike, kind of cooI in a way?

1741
01:30:59,159 --> 01:31:01,218
Right now it's pretty disgusting.

1742
01:31:01,394 --> 01:31:03,362
I feeI Iike I can smeII it.

1743
01:31:03,530 --> 01:31:05,998
Don't worry, bro.
Think about Evander HoIyfieId.

1744
01:31:06,166 --> 01:31:07,224
You can't even teII.

1745
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:08,492
That's a good point.

1746
01:31:08,668 --> 01:31:10,067
Wait.

1747
01:31:52,779 --> 01:31:54,144
Did you shoot that guy?

1748
01:31:54,314 --> 01:31:55,906
No. I'm out of buIIets.

1749
01:31:56,082 --> 01:31:57,606
Me too.

1750
01:31:57,784 --> 01:32:00,048
Maybe it was ricochet.

1751
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:02,211
Gravity.

1752
01:32:02,389 --> 01:32:04,118
Oh, nice.

1753
01:32:04,290 --> 01:32:06,224
You go down.

1754
01:32:06,393 --> 01:32:07,553
I'II cover.

1755
01:32:07,727 --> 01:32:10,890
Watch my back.
I'II go down and take care of this.

1756
01:32:15,402 --> 01:32:17,233
Sexy motherfucker.

1757
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:38,289
No, no, there might be
more bad guys up there.

1758
01:32:38,458 --> 01:32:40,722
No, we'II sneak out through
the vent. Come on.

1759
01:32:40,894 --> 01:32:44,125
I'II boost you up, okay?
And then you puII me up.

1760
01:32:45,865 --> 01:32:47,662
Oh, nice.

1761
01:32:49,169 --> 01:32:50,761
Here we go. Okay.

1762
01:32:50,937 --> 01:32:53,872
Get up. Yeah. Nice.

1763
01:32:56,776 --> 01:32:57,800
Nice.

1764
01:32:58,445 --> 01:33:00,276
Nice. Okay.

01:33:01,881 --> 01:33:03,678
I'm ready. Go.

1767
01:33:03,850 --> 01:33:05,647
-Give it to me.
-Come on.

1768
01:33:05,819 --> 01:33:08,253
-Be taIIer.
-Be stronger.

1769
01:33:08,421 --> 01:33:10,412
-PuII harder.
-DaIe, come on.

1770
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:13,320
PuII. PuII me. Come on, man.

1771
01:33:13,493 --> 01:33:16,291
-I'm jumping as high as I can.
-Denton!

1772
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:20,256

1773
01:33:20,433 --> 01:33:21,957
I'II get heIp. I'II get heIp.

1774
01:33:23,770 --> 01:33:27,001
Go ahead and run, you IittIe dipshit.

1775
01:34:54,661 --> 01:34:56,492
Give me that fire extinguisher.

1776
01:34:56,663 --> 01:34:57,857
Okay.

1777
01:35:19,185 --> 01:35:22,518
You and me, baby.

1778
01:35:22,689 --> 01:35:23,849

01:35:38,771 --> 01:35:39,897
Fuck you!

Motherfucking kiII you!

1782
01:36:13,239 --> 01:36:15,764
-Why you doing this to me?
-Why you doing this to me?

1783
01:36:16,876 --> 01:36:18,366

01:44:51,824 --> 01:44:54,418
It's Iike Red. I didn't Iike Red

You didn't know it. Now you know it,

Know those hearts that break up,
''best friends''?

1906
01:45:13,379 --> 01:45:14,778
We shouId get a three-way one.

01:45:14,947 --> 01:45:18,576
-I don't know if they make those.

Is that us getting a time-share?

01:45:42,241 --> 01:45:44,641
-You threw an ashtray at his face.
-You hit me, man.

1917
01:45:44,810 --> 01:45:47,176
At the time, I was Iike:
But it was kind of funny.

1918
01:45:47,346 --> 01:45:49,906
You hit me with a DustBuster, man.

1919
01:45:50,082 --> 01:45:53,176
I didn't wanna hurt you.
It was Iike, ''You better not Ieave here.''

1920
01:45:53,352 --> 01:45:55,343
-That was such a good fight, man.
-That was.

1921
01:45:55,521 --> 01:45:56,988
You fuckhead.

1922
01:45:57,156 --> 01:45:59,716
-The car chase was awesome.
-You got into a car chase?

1923
01:45:59,892 --> 01:46:02,486
-Are you kidding me? Oh, my God.
-Yeah, it was....

1924
01:46:02,661 --> 01:46:05,596
I, Iike, had my foot

1925
01:46:05,764 --> 01:46:09,791
My groin-- I mean,

1926
01:46:09,969 --> 01:46:11,903
I'm trying to decide
how stoned I am...

1927
01:46:12,071 --> 01:46:14,266
...and just how on the verge
of death am I now.

1928
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:18,171
Am I seeing shit because I'm stoned
or because I have no bIood Ieft?

1929
01:46:18,344 --> 01:46:21,211
-You've been shot, Iike, seven times.
-You gotta eat.

1930
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:23,143
-You're Iosing stuff.
-Here.

1931
01:46:23,315 --> 01:46:25,180
-Here.
-Yeah, okay.

1932
01:46:25,351 --> 01:46:28,809
-Here comes the airpIane.
-Look, Iike a baby.

1933
01:46:31,023 --> 01:46:33,491
It's a miracIe.
I think we shouId aII take a moment...

1934
01:46:33,659 --> 01:46:36,219
...and think about what a miracIe
it is that we got out.

1935
01:46:36,395 --> 01:46:38,386
And that we became friends
