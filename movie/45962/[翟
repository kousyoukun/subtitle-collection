1
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:17,493
-When did it start?
-At 0500. We're seven minutes in.

2
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,336
Private Miller...

3
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,548
...you've been smoking Item 9
for seven minutes and 13 seconds.

4
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,675
We're going to ask you
several questions.

5
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:33,843
How do you feel?

6
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,262
Well, sir...

7
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,181
...I feel like a....

8
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,392
Like a slice of butter...

9
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:47,982
...melting on top
of a big old pile of flapjacks.

10
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:51,611
Yeah.

11
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:55,156
Okay, Private Miller,
when you think of your superiors...

12
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,201
...what emotions do you feel?

13
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,876
Okay, Private Miller?

14
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:11,547
Is this normal?

15
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,382
Okay, Private--

16
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,302
Okay, Private Miller?

17
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,054
Private Miller.

18
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,100
Answer the question.

19
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,399
This went out, sir.

20
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,236
Can you torch me?

21
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,029
We'll send someone in.

22
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,366
Holy bejesus!

23
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,916
Private Miller, answer the question.

24
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,626
What was the question again, sir?

25
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:53,256
When you think of your superiors,
what emotions do you feel?

26
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,174
You know what problem I have...

27
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,678
...with your fucking little
dog-and-pony act you call the military?

28
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:02,223
Here it is. One: lots of dudes.

29
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,808
Where are the boobies?

30
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:07,436
Two: Why are we
underground right now, sir?

31
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,773
Why can't we be out in the open?
Why aren't we in a square right now?

32
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:14,277
Why aren't we talking to people,
letting them know Item 9 exists?

33
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,988
Get it out. Shout off the rooftops:

34
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:21,659
"This is great!
This is the bee's knees, Item 9!"

35
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,494
Private, we need you to be serious.

36
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:27,415
I'm serious. Your dick, my mouth.

37
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,254
That's inappropriate.

38
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,555
Fuck you!

39
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:46,392
I've seen enough. Shut it down.

40
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,146
Bury the hatch. Sell the land.
And dispose of him.

41
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,647
This never happened.

42
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,441
Dude, what happened to your eye?

43
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,651
Hello.

44
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,987
Can you guys understand me?

45
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,032
-Hey. Hey, where we going?
-This is General Brat.

46
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,993
We've reached
a final conclusion on Item 9.

47
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,245
Illegal!

48
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,538
Hey, this is Sam. Good morning

49
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:07,872
Hey, this is Sam. Good morning

50
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,206
Welcome to KRAD

51
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,335
You know, I think that last caller
had some undeniable points.

52
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,171
Right now, we're gonna get
to the next caller, Dale Denton

53
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,256
Hey, Sam. Big huge fan.
First-time caller.

54
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,760
-Here's my piece.
-All right.

55
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,679
If marijuana is not legal
within the next five years...

56
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,933
...I have no faith
left in humanity, period.

57
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,935
Everyone likes smoking weed.

58
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,521
They have for thousands of years.
They're not gonna stop anytime soon.

59
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,857
It makes everything better. Makes
food better. Makes music better.

60
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,360
It makes sex feel better
for God's sakes.

61
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,363
It makes shitty movies better
you know?

62
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,666
Hi, there. Are you Sandra Danby?

63
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,875
Yeah.

64
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:57,672
Well, I'm Garth
from Global Saviors, and....

65
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,090
-What is this?
-I'm joking.

66
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,467
You failed to show up
for divorce proceedings...

67
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,429
...four times under court order,
and you've been served.

68
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,099
-Oh, great. Thanks a lot, asshole.
-Sorry.

69
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,851
I'm just saying love has no age

70
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,230
You can't instantly tell me that a man,
because he's a certain age...

71
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,357
...can't marry a woman
or love a woman.

72
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:17,900
I'm dating a high-school girl.

73
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,821
You're not maximizing your potential
Think this girl takes you seriously?

74
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:25,366
No, but if I'm 25
and the girl is 18 years old...

75
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,576
...you know, in society,
that might look bad.

76
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,871
-Hey, as long as it's consensual
-I think it's consensual.

77
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,000
Yo, you been served.

78
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,586
You've been served.
You've been served.

79
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,839
You've been served.

80
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,931
Walter Wadska the third.

81
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,434
You here to fix the fax machine?

82
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,854
No, I'm here to tell you
you owe MasterCard 4068 bucks.

83
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,398
You've been served by the best.
Keep it real.

84
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:06,449
Why don't you get a real job,
you fucking cocksucker?

85
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:15,833
-Hey, "Electric Avenue."
-I know, right?

86
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:20,212
-Take that shit to the next level, eh?
-Okay, I will.

87
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,268
-Dr. Edgar Terrence?
-Yes.

88
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,937
You have repeatedly refused
to trim the monkey tree...

89
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,148
...that spills
onto your neighbor's property.

90
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,901
And now because of that,
you've been served.

91
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,152
You're a jerk.

92
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,321
All this current system is doing...

93
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,740
...is putting money
in the hands of criminals...

94
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,619
...and it's making ordinary people like
you and me deal with those criminals.

95
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:55,247
You ever dealt with a drug dealer?
It's terrible, it's weird, it's awkward.

96
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,416
They think they're your friend,
but they're not.

97
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:01,545
Dale, I get your point. Thanks
for your input. Next caller, please

98
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,976
I can't come.

99
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,354
What?

100
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,523
Why the fuck not, Dale?

101
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,024
I just-- Look, I can't come.

102
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,944
I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow.
It's a bad day for me.

103
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:28,280
Jesus Christ, Dale.
When were you gonna tell me?

104
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,990
My mom has been shopping all day.

105
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,034
-Why?
-She's already planning on couscous.

106
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,204
I said I might be able to go,
so why is she doing that already?

107
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,373
-Now I look like an asshole.
-You are one.

108
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,251
Come on, don't say that.
I just can't go. I have a job.

109
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,877
-Fine.
-"Fine"?

110
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,504
Don't come. I don't care.

111
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,966
Then why have you been inviting me?
I thought you wanted me to go.

112
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,385
If you don't wanna meet them,
I don't want you to.

113
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:53,180
I want to. I can't. I have a job.
I'm sorry. What do you want from me?

114
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,850
I just know they'll like you, that's all.

115
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,185
You're great, and you're funny...

116
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,229
...and you're sexy.

117
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,857
I just want them to see that.

118
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,693
-You want them to see that I'm sexy?
-Hey, people?

119
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,403
-Hi, Mr. Edwards.
-Can I help you?

120
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,572
No, I'm good. Thank you, though.

121
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,741
Yeah? I see you don't have
a visitor's badge. That's why I ask.

122
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,911
-I'm with her, actually.
-Actually, this is my boyfriend.

123
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:20,374
I heard that. I wish I didn't hear that,
but I just heard that.

124
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,876
What's that supposed to mean?

125
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,671
I'm just wondering why you don't
date a nice guy your own age.

126
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,798
-She's very mature for her age.
-Yeah.

127
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,550
-Angie, hey. How's it going?
-Hey.

128
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,760
Hey, Clark, how you doing, man?
What's up?

129
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,722
I'm good, bro. I'm good.

130
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,515
Dude, I wanted to tell you.

131
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,559
You were hilarious today
in drama class.

132
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,270
Your Jeff Goldblum impression
made me pee my pants.

133
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:42,938
I wish.

134
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,691
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

135
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,402
Last week when we worked out,
you forgot your shorts in my car.

136
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,945
Oh, yeah.

137
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,530
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

138
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,115
Yeah, no problem, no problem.

139
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,742
-Can you hold those?
-Yeah.

140
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,952
-Yeah.
-How's it going, Sporty Spice?

141
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,412
This is my boyfriend, Dale.

142
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,039
-Hey, nice to meet you.
-You too.

143
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,333
I've heard so much about you.
You're real cool.

144
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,752
-I mean, you're great. Yeah.
-Yeah, awesome.

145
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,714
Anyways, yeah, dude, next year.
Next year college, man. College.

146
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,133
Gonna be kick-ass.
I will watch her back for you.

147
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:15,262
I know there's tons of guys that are
gonna be trying to get on that shit.

148
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,306
-Oh, good.
-Because I got that-- Yeah.

149
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,141
You got her ass? Perfect.

150
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,144
-I'll watch her ass for--
-He's trying to be nice.

151
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,438
-I'll catch you at Home Ec.
-Okay.

152
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,732
You guys got Home Ec
together too. That's cool.

153
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,151
-We got a few classes together.
-Nice to meet you.

154
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:33,155
Time to suck today's dick. That's what
I'm talking about. See you guys later.

155
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,241
-All right, Clark.
-Clark's a great guy.

156
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,493
He's totally gonna take care
of Angela, man.

157
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:40,829
He's great. He's a wonderful
lab partner. He'll keep an eye on her.

158
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,249
Why don't you go fuck yourself,
you weird prick?

159
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,501
I'm a teacher.
You can't talk to me like that.

160
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,962
I'm not a student,
so I can say whatever I want...

161
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,381
-...you chimp-fucking little bastard.
-Actually--

162
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,342
You've got T-minus 30 seconds
to get off school property...

163
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,177
...or I call the liaison officer.

164
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,514
-We're leaving. I'm sorry.
-Middle finger won't stop the clock.

165
00:09:58,682 --> 00:09:59,682
What a jerk.

166
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,600
What's that guy's problem? Jesus.

167
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,812
I don't-- Normally he's--
That's really weird.

168
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,982
I'd love to have dinner with you
and your parents tomorrow night.

169
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,026
I'm gonna go. I'll definitely go.
I'll shuffle things around--

170
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,070
-Really?
-Yeah, I'll be there for sure.

171
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,614
Yeah, I wanna show them
you're in good hands. Yeah.

172
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,533
I got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

173
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,535
That means so much to me
and my parents.

174
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,705
No problem.
It's gonna be awesome.

175
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,875
-Hello?
-Hey, Saul. Mind if I come by?

176
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,045
-Come on down.
-Sweet. Be there.

177
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,880
-Hi, Mary
-Hi.

178
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,675
I thought the hurricane season
was over.

179
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,510
I thought hurricane season
was over.

180
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,470
I'm sorry.
Things just got out of hand

181
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,015
Yeah, that's the way it was
with my first husband.

182
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,894
Hello? Hey, man.

183
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,813
What the fuck, man?

184
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,607
I didn't buzz you in.
How the monkey did you get in here?

185
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,944
Some guy with a fauxhawk let me in.
He was leaving when I--

186
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,238
-Fucking Kyle.
-It might have been Kyle.

187
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,032
-Asshole.
-I'm sorry, man.

188
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,242
What the fuck's
the buzzer for anyway?

189
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,912
I don't know. I'm sorry about that.
I don't know your protocol yet.

190
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,331
Stuff your sorries in a sack.
It's not your fault.

191
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,460
-Okay.
-It's these jerk-offs. Have a seat.

192
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,628
Okay, cool.
Thanks, man. Awesome.

193
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,006
Yo, check this out.

194
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,094
Satellite radio.

195
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:22,222
Got two TVs and radio.
That's pretty rad.

196
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,682
That's home entertainment.

197
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,061
You're very entertained.
Oh, wow. You got a cute picture too.

198
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,354
Oh, yeah. Me and my bubbe.

199
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,440
Hey, let me ask you something.

200
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,941
Yeah?

201
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:37,321
Do you think you could pull the plug
on someone if you needed to?

202
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,573
Like, euthanasia?

203
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,744
Like, on her?

204
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,746
If I needed to.

205
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,710
I'm kind of in a hurry, man.

206
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,546
I don't know if we should
start going down that road.

207
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,674
I could talk all day about euthanasia.
Don't get me started.

208
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,384
-Maybe we should--
-We'll save it.

209
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,887
-Save it for next time.
-I'll take that rain check.

210
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,472
Business for the businessman.

211
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,766
-Yeah, you got my number.
-Okay.

212
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,351
-Brass tacks.
-Yes.

213
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,938
Just got a shipment
of the dopest dope I've ever smoked.

214
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,981
Hands down,
dopest dope I've ever smoked.

215
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,235
Not better than the Blue Oyster.
It can't be. I can't handle that.

216
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:21,073
This is like if that Blue Oyster shit
met that Afghan Kush I had...

217
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,699
...and they had a baby.

218
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,702
And meanwhile, that crazy
Northern Lights stuff I had...

219
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,540
...and the Super Red Especial
Snowflake met and had a baby.

220
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:33,168
And by some miracle,
those two babies met and fucked...

221
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:36,547
...this would be the shit
that they birthed.

222
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,049
-Yes.
-This is the product of baby fucking.

223
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,509
-Smell it.
-Okay.

224
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,011
Smell it. Enjoy.

225
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,348
It's like God's vagina.

226
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,351
What, you wanna bathe in it?

227
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,395
-I wanna live in here.
-You wanna be it?

228
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,690
My God, I just wanna shove it
up my nose, have that smell all day.

229
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,942
-That's amazing.
-Shove it anywhere you like.

230
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,402
Beautiful. What's it called?

231
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,696
-Pineapple Express.
-Pineapple Express.

232
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,865
It's this thing, like, El Niño.

233
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,034
This airflow that comes
from Hawaii and Canada.

234
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,079
It gets the dirt, mixes it in
with the weed in a special way.

235
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,582
It's very scientific.
I won't go into it right now.

236
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,418
But I am the only guy
in the whole city that has it.

237
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,170
Only 10 bones more for a quarter.

238
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,046
Okay, I'll take a quarter.

239
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,215
-All right, you're on.
-Thank you very much.

240
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,717
Let me get my scale.

241
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:25,262
Get it going. Grab the scale.
Let's get me out of here.

242
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,224
I thought hurricane season
was over.

243
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,477
Oh, crow.

244
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,608
Where are you, you little fucker?

245
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:42,237
What the fuck is this thing?

246
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,907
-Cross joint.
-Yeah.

247
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,409
-You ever smoke one of those?
-You can smoke this?

248
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,660
-Yeah, man.
-No.

249
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,913
This is the future.

250
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,918
This is, like, the apex
of the vortex of joint engineering.

251
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,338
It's rumored that M. M. O'Shaughnessy
designed the first one.

252
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,090
The guy who designed
the Golden Gate Bridge.

253
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,509
My second favorite civil engineer...

254
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,555
...behind Hannskarl Bandel,
Madison Square Garden.

255
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:12,517
What you do is you light all three ends
at the same time.

256
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,938
-Really?
-And then the smoke converges...

257
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:20,192
...creating a trifecta
of joint-smoking power.

258
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,612
This is it, man. This is what your
grandchildren are gonna be smoking.

259
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,781
Future. The future.

260
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,492
That's amazing.
Well, got the weed?

261
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,578
-Yeah.
-In the bag. Beautiful. Okay.

262
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:35,666
Be careful with that thing, man.
Here's the cash, grab the stash.

263
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,626
Alrighty, man, thanks.
Have a good one.

264
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,586
Don't hurt yourself. Adios.

265
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,880
Well, hey, wait a minute, man.

266
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,799
Let's smoke this fucking thing.

267
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,801
I really-- I can't, man. I gotta--

268
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,095
I can't even light this thing
on my own.

269
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,181
Yeah, I need your help, man.

270
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,642
-I'm in.
-Come on!

271
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,603
-Why not? Let's do it.
-Come on down!

272
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,647
Why not? What do I do?

273
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,982
Okay, here's what you do.

274
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,858
-You equip yourself.
-I'm equipping.

275
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,443
-Equip me, sir.
-Okay.

276
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:08,490
You are going to light these two ends
while I light this end.

277
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,409
-Okay.
-Are you ready?

278
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,453
-Ready.
-Blast off.

279
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,180
-I'm gonna do it.
-Good. Go for it.

280
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,694
It's better to cough.

281
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,404
It's like--

282
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,197
Makes you 10 times more higher...

283
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,616
...than the cross weed
and the Pineapple Express.

284
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,579
You're like,
totally fucking Gong Show'ed, man.

285
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,926
Oh, fuck.

286
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,553
Hang on one second, man.

287
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:12,763
Oh, you fucker.

288
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:18,935
Who is it?

289
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,937
It's Chris Gebert, man. Let me up

290
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,314
Shit.

291
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,066
What's a Gebert?

292
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,817
Come on up.

293
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,321
He ain't getting any
of that Pineapple Express.

294
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:33,867
Chris is getting Snicklefritz.

295
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,162
Hey.

296
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,331
So listen, man.

297
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,917
I gotta ask you. So....

298
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:46,046
Listen, man. You've been buying
from me for, like, two months, right?

299
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,507
-Two months.
-I gotta ask, man.

300
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,217
What's up with the suit?

301
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:53,178
I'm a process server.
So I have to wear a suit.

302
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:57,724
Wow, you're a servant?
Like a butler?

303
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:01,103
-A chauffeur?
-No. No. What? No, I'm not--

304
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,356
-Shine shoes?
-I'm a process server.

305
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,024
-I like--
-In process.

306
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,151
I work for a company
that's, like, hired...

307
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,320
...by lawyers to hand out
legal documents.

308
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,614
Like subpoenas to people
who don't want them.

309
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:16,618
I gotta wear disguises sometimes just to
make them admit they're themselves...

310
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,037
...so I can serve them the papers.

311
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,247
Disguise.

312
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:21,540
Kind of, I guess.

313
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,750
-It's a hell of a job.
-That's cool, man.

314
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:28,088
Like a day-to-day basis, it's fine.
Like today, I, like, sat in my car...

315
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,714
...I smoked, like, 10 doobies...

316
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,384
...and then I went to go visit
my girlfriend at lunch.

317
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,177
Nice.

318
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,805
What? You sucked on her titties?

319
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:40,016
No, I just kissed her.
I just did that to make it seem cool.

320
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,686
That's cool.
Does she like to smoke weed?

321
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,980
A little sometimes.
She has a couple--

322
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,899
She's in high school,
so as much as any high-school kid.

323
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,901
She's cool as hell, actually.

324
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,820
-You'd get along with her.
-Really?

325
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,698
Yeah, you know, it only sucks...

326
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:58,618
...when I go visit her in high school
and the guys she goes to school with...

327
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,204
...are strong and handsome
and really funny.

328
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:04,249
Like, do good impressions
of Jeff Goldblum and shit like that.

329
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:09,421
And, like, I just feel like a fat, dumb,
fucking stinky ass-turd when I'm there.

330
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,798
-What?
-It really-- It sucks for my ego.

331
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,342
-Fuck Jeff Goldblum, man.
-That's what I say.

332
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,179
You know, don't get down on yourself.
You got a great girl.

333
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,764
You got a great job
where you don't do anything.

334
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,058
You get to smoke weed all day.

335
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,602
I wish I had that.

336
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,105
Are you kidd--? You do.
You have the easiest job on Earth.

337
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,358
-You do smoke weed all day.
-That's true.

338
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,986
You didn't think of that.

339
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,197
-I do have a good job.
-Yeah, you do nothing.

340
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,615
-Thanks, man.
-No prob.

341
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,408
Thank you.

342
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,703
Oh, shit. All right. Business.

343
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,706
-Got my persona.
-Yeah, yeah.

344
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,374
Hey. Put that cross joint out.

345
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,960
He sees that, he'll never
get the fuck out of here.

346
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,339
-What's up, Chris?
-Yo, hey, Saul.

347
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:53,840
-Hey.
-How you doing, buddy?

348
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,300
All right, homes. Good.

349
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,594
-Who's this?
-Hey. Oh, that's my friend Mark.

350
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,721
You got the dough? There you go.

351
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,057
-Appreciate it.
-Nice. Good to meet you, Mark.

352
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,601
-Do you have any Percocet, please?
-Percocet?

353
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,103
What are you talking about?
I don't sell that shit.

354
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,313
-Chris.
-Chris.

355
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,232
You told him I was
gonna sell Percocet?

356
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,901
-I didn't say anything about Percocet.
-What the fuck?

357
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,278
-I just wanted a couple Percocets.
-Well, I....

358
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:17,364
You came to the wrong place.
Wrong place.

359
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:20,408
-Sorry.
-Yeah, nice. Peace out, homes.

360
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,826
-Thank--
-God.

361
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,995
-What the fuck?
-Yeah.

362
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,997
-Fucking lingerer.
-Yeah, totally.

363
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,541
-Lingerer.
-Hardcore.

364
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,209
Fuck.

365
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,920
-Bums me out.
-Bums me out too.

366
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:35,715
If there's one quality
I hate in a person, it's lingering.

367
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,593
-That's right. You and me both.
-Yeah, yeah.

368
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:42,013
So I'm curious. What have
those people done that you go...

369
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,266
...and process and service?

370
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,935
I don't know. It's always
something different, I guess.

371
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,395
This guy....

372
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:51,273
Ted Jones, who knows. You know?

373
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,692
-Ted Jones?
-Yeah, why?

374
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,654
My guy, Red, who I buy from,
he gets his stuff from a Ted Jones.

375
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,739
-Really?
-Maybe it's the same guy.

376
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,949
That'd be weird.

377
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,660
It's a pretty normal name,
I guess, but....

378
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:07,372
Anyway, I should really
get going, man. I gotta go.

379
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,874
Duty calls, but it's good to see you.
Thanks.

380
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,669
You're gonna smoke and run?
Come on, man.

381
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,880
We can go look at some crazy things
on the Internet together.

382
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,175
That sounds appealing, but I think
I should probably just get going.

383
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,760
-Oh, that sucks.
-Yeah.

384
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,221
That's cool, man.
What are you doing this weekend?

385
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,308
Because, you know, my bubbe's
got season tickets to the opera...

386
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,644
...and she can't make it,
so wanna go see Phantom?

387
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,689
-Of the Opera?
-Yeah.

388
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,318
I can't this weekend,
but you know what? Here.

389
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:40,196
You know-- I'll run out of weed in
a couple days. I'll come by, hang out.

390
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,158
-We'll watch 227 and shit.
-Definitely.

391
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,201
Cool, man. Well, thanks.
Good to see you.

392
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,536
-Peace, brother.
-Okay.

393
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,204
One love.

394
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,498
When you got behind
on the mortgage...

395
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,459
...someone finally
made you a loan?

396
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:53,710
Yes, he did

397
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,504
Yes, he did.
What was the interest rate you got?

398
00:20:56,672 --> 00:21:01,259
-It was 12 or 13 percent
-That's disgusting.

399
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,771
-Hello?
-Hello.

400
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,564
Hey, Angie, what's happening?

401
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:18,193
I just talked to my mom, and they are
so excited you're coming for dinner.

402
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:21,529
Like, so excited. And so am I
but we're all really excited.

403
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,697
Thank you so much

404
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,200
No problem. I'm psyched too.
It's gonna be awesome.

405
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:29,037
Couscous. The food so nice,
they named it twice.

406
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,917
Dale, anyway, I can't wait
for next year when this bullshit's over

407
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:37,003
Oh, shit. I see the guy I gotta serve.
I'll call you back.

408
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,089
Fucking cops. Shit.

409
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,014
Jesus.

410
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:55,230
What an adorable little cop.

411
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,315
Weird.

412
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,738
Jesus. Fuck.

413
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,907
What the fuck was that?

414
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,367
Oh, shit.

415
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:11,204
Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude.

416
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,414
Oh, no!

417
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,554
-Drive, drive.
-Who the fuck is that?

418
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:29,723
I don't know,
but I ain't waiting to see.

419
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,629
Pineapple Express.

420
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,759
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

421
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,427
I saw brains and blood!

422
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,053
Come on! Come on!

423
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,305
Where do I go?

424
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:27,739
Hello?

425
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,657
Saul, it's Dale.
Let me in. Let me in.

426
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,285
I just saw some crazy shit.
Please. Let me in.

427
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:35,246
-It's Dale Denton. Let me in, man
-Dale?

428
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,041
Yes, Dale. That's what I said
It's Dale. Let me in.

429
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,293
Oh, all right, man. Come on up.

430
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,466
I buzzed it. Open the door
when I buzz it.

431
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,468
Buzz it in three seconds exactly

432
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:51,095
One, two--

433
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,306
-Did it work?
-On three!

434
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:56,309
I did it on three.
On "one, two, three, go"?

435
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,228
Just on three

436
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,824
-He fucking killed him.
-Hey, I got neighbors.

437
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,450
He fucking killed him.

438
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,578
-Who killed who?
-A cop. A lady and a guy.

439
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,873
A cop, a lady and a guy?
That's a massacre. You saw it?

440
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,042
No, it was just a guy.

441
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,877
-What happened to the lady?
-No. No.

442
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:27,715
A woman. A policewoman and a guy,
another guy, shot another guy...

443
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,885
...an Asian guy, in the window,
at fucking Ted's house.

444
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,637
Whoa, was the other guy Ted?

445
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,889
I don't know.
He was a big, gray-haired man...

446
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,808
...and he had a robe
and he shot him.

447
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,894
And his brain flew every--
I'm gonna be-- I'm gonna throw up.

448
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,521
What?

449
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,983
-That was chicken fries.
-Sick.

450
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,568
You threw up on my printer.

451
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,069
-I did.
-Did you break it?

452
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,154
-I hope not.
-Listen, man.

453
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,823
I think the guy was Ted.

454
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,825
And the Asians
are number-two in town...

455
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,910
...so you saw Ted
capping the competition.

456
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,912
They saw me
seeing them shoot the guy.

457
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,747
What? They saw you?

458
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,249
And you fucking came here?

459
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,418
-Did they follow you here?
-I don't know.

460
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:07,839
-Did they follow you here?
-I don't know. Look. Look. Okay.

461
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,717
I saw them kill him.

462
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:13,595
I freaked out. I panicked, okay?

463
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,930
I tossed my roach.

464
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:18,558
-I crashed into two cars.
-Yeah.

465
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:21,853
So they must have heard--
They know someone was out there.

466
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,147
-They know someone saw.
-They know "someone."

467
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:26,941
They don't know it was you. Right?

468
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,528
I don't-- I mean, yeah. I don't know.

469
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,280
-Yes.
-I hope not.

470
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:33,489
Relax.

471
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:38,453
Just sit back. Get ready to enjoy some
of the rarest weed known to mankind.

472
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,457
Is it really that rare?

473
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,959
It's, like, the rarest.

474
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,629
It's almost a shame to smoke it.

475
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,758
It's like killing a unicorn...

476
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:53,635
...with, like, a bomb.

477
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,097
Are you the only guy in town
who has this?

478
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,391
-You're actually the only guy?
-Yeah.

479
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,145
My guy Red said he was giving me
an exclusive sneak preview.

480
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:07,398
I'm the only guy you sold it to?
The other guys got Snicklefritz?

481
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,652
Yeah. So we're, like, the only guys.

482
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,654
And Red got this from Ted?

483
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,155
Ted's the man.

484
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,867
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go!

485
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,370
I threw a roach of this
outside of Ted's house.

486
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,538
So what? I throw roaches
all over town.

487
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:26,125
No. He could find the roach
and say, "It's Pineapple Express.

488
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,503
Saul is the only guy
who has Pineapple Express.

489
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,755
He must have seen the murder!
Let's kill him!"

490
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,340
-Let's get out of here!
-Fuck!

491
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:35,343
Wait! Stop!
Get weed! Get the weed!

492
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,680
Anything we might need.
Snacks, food, Fruit Roll-Ups.

493
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,974
-Let's get the fuck out of here!
-Okay, okay.

494
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,203
Red said he'd be here.

495
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,171
Them some drugs.

496
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,883
Smells like vomit in this house.

497
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,927
Want a hit, man? It's still lit.

498
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,263
I'm having dinner with my wife.
She can tell.

499
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,098
Smell it on my sweater.

500
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,725
For real?

501
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,184
Yeah, for real.

502
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,146
You wanna wear my vest?
It smell good.

503
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,397
Not my style.

504
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,899
You ain't got no style, motherfucker.

505
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,527
You have reached
the voice mailbox of...

506
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,320
-Ted.
-Ted, it's Budlofsky.

507
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,282
-We're here. Saul's gone.
-And Mathe--

508
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,494
-And Matheson.
-I think he knew we were coming.

509
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,787
They not here, Ted.

510
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,664
Hi, Ted.

511
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,542
Okay, what do you know
about Ted?

512
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,586
I think he's crazy about murdering.

513
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:54,088
Jesus, man.
Well, how much money do you have?

514
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:57,425
-I have, like, the 75 that you gave me.
-That's it?

515
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,469
-Well, how much do you have?
-Three bucks.

516
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,221
What you getting on my case for?
I have more than you.

517
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:06,142
Well, that's my 75 technically.
So I have $78 and you have nothing.

518
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,688
I don't know. Let's just go-- Go to
a motel or a hotel and just hide out.

519
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:14,442
The police were in on it. Could have
flagged credit cards. They'll find us.

520
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:18,613
Shit. I wish we could
just go nowhere.

521
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:21,908
Okay.

522
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:27,789
Even if he found that roach,
how could he know where you are?

523
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,084
Heat-seeking missiles.

524
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:33,920
Bloodhounds.

525
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,506
Foxes.

526
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,299
Barracudas.

527
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,677
I'm kind of flabbergasted when
you say things like that. It's weird.

528
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:42,887
Thank you.

529
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,098
Not a compliment.
Here's the question.

530
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,183
Let's say he actually
found the roach.

531
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:51,562
How could he connect
the Pineapple Express weed to you?

532
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,066
He can't, man.
Only fucking Red knows.

533
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,110
Only Red knows, man.

534
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,694
Who is Red?

535
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:02,532
Red's, like, the middleman
between, like, Ted and me.

536
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,784
And we're, like,
mad fucking tight, man.

537
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:07,036
One time, he got this girl...

538
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:10,623
...to give me a hand job, like,
within five minutes of meeting her.

539
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:15,336
It was like, "I don't
even know your name, whoa."

540
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:20,675
That is pretty rad, but, like,
let's say Ted calls him and is like:

541
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:23,010
"Did you sell the Pineapple Express
to anyone?"

542
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,805
He'll be, "Yeah, I sold it to Saul."
Why wouldn't he?

543
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,683
No. Oh, no. Fuck that, man.

544
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:32,436
Fucking hand job, Dale.
Imagine if I gave you a hand job.

545
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:36,440
-Why would I wanna do that?
-No, I mean if I got you a hand job.

546
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,068
The same rules don't apply to Red.
He's a drug dealer.

547
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:44,866
I'm a drug dealer.
Are you saying you don't trust me?

548
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,161
No, that's not at all what I'm--
You know what?

549
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:52,290
You know? Just ignore what I said.
Call him. Give him a call.

550
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,083
See what the dealio is.

551
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,589
-Hello.
-Hey, Red, you okay?

552
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,884
Yeah, Saul. Yeah, I'm fine, man.
I just stubbed my toe.

553
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:06,053
Be careful, man. Be careful.
Wear shoes in the house.

554
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,223
Safety. Safety first, then teamwork.
Now, listen.

555
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,893
You know that Pineapple Express stuff
you gave me?

556
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,729
Don't tell anybody
that you sold it to me.

557
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:16,189
I'd never talk to anyone...

558
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:20,568
...about the stuff that I do with you
involving drugs.

559
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:23,237
All right, cool.
Listen, I'm gonna come by.

560
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,239
I gotta lay some shit on you.

561
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,033
There is a fly in the ointment.

562
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:29,744
Shit has hit the fan.
The lion will speak.

563
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:32,246
-I'm in the middle of a convo.
-No, seriously.

564
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,916
-We're gonna be there in half an hour.
-Perfect.

565
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,085
-No, please. No, no, no.
-Let's go over there and chill out.

566
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,713
No, can we go tomorrow?
Look, we're already here....

567
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,299
There's somebody else
on the phone with him.

568
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:44,508
-Who?
-I don't know.

569
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,302
He's whispering to another man.

570
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,305
We'll go in the morning.
It's better that way.

571
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:52,975
-Okay.
-Yes. Yes. Thank you. Yes.

572
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:55,561
-Hey.
-So you're coming by tomorrow?

573
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:56,771
How'd you know that?

574
00:30:56,939 --> 00:31:00,816
Heard you whispering to that other guy
that you were talking to. Who is that?

575
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,611
Right, Dale. Good job.
Listen, I can't go in the morning...

576
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,614
...because my bubbe-- Gotta change
her clocks. Daylight-savings.

577
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,283
Is that the bubbe
that's on 41st and River Street?

578
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,869
The one where we played
shuffleboard that one time?

579
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,664
You got it. So, listen,
we'll be chilling by noon.

580
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,959
-Noon it is, bromosexual.
-Nice.

581
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,795
We should hit up the casino again.
It's been a while.

582
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:23,631
Okay, yeah.
We'll definitely hit the casino up

583
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:27,093
Definitely. All right, peace, brother.

584
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,136
-Where is he?
-I don't know.

585
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,180
-Why'd he mention a casino?
-I don't know.

586
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:34,141
You make me call my good
friend, send him into a booby trap.

587
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,977
-And lie to him.
-Is Saul Asian?

588
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,145
-Making me a shitty person.
-Is he Asian?

589
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,689
-He's not Asian.
-You're lying.

590
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,400
-I'm not lying. I'm not lying.
-You're lying.

591
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,110
Did you hear slot machines?

592
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:46,904
-Man, I don't know where he is.
-You tell me where he is.

593
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,949
Tell me. In 45 minutes,
I gotta go have dinner with my wife.

594
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,701
-I got a reservation.
-Forty-five?

595
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,036
That's a dinner reservation
you gonna miss.

596
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,663
That's a reservation I'll make.

597
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,249
-I don't think so.
-Because if he doesn't start to--

598
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:02,503
-Look, can you do this one solo?
-No, I can't do this solo. Are you crazy?

599
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:06,299
-What are you talking about? What?
-What, you trying to abandon me?

600
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,552
This is teamwork. This is a
partnership. We are in this together.

601
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,345
-You want me to stay?
-Yes.

602
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:12,847
-Fine, I'll stay.
-Thank you.

603
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:15,016
-You happy now?
-Yes.

604
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,476
There's no way that
we could pause for a minute...

605
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,978
...you guys go home...

606
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:22,273
...and then tomorrow we
could just, like, continue?

607
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:29,196
I should call Angie soon.

608
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,408
Make up some bullshit.

609
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:33,659
I'm cold.

610
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:36,912
You're cold?
Oh, I'm not cold at all. Here.

611
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,080
I run hot.

612
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:39,582
-Really?
-Yeah.

613
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,044
-You got more body mass.
-Thick blood. Yeah, no, take it.

614
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:46,422
-Thank you.
-I don't appreciate that, but it's okay.

615
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,841
I'm gonna call Angie.

616
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,099
Space.

617
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:00,686
Dale, wait. Wait.

618
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,440
The phones. The phones.

619
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,901
-You said they were cops, right?
-They are, yeah.

620
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,611
I was thinking, maybe they can...

621
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:11,530
...triangulate these things, man,
or, like, trace them.

622
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,616
-Right?
-That's how they got Saddam.

623
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:15,618
-Right.
-Fuck. You're right, man.

624
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,453
Maybe they can even trace them...

625
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:20,081
...like, when we're not even
on them, you know?

626
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,751
Maybe if we bury them, the reception
will cut off and they won't be able to.

627
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,878
We can tie it to an animal,
be a diversion.

628
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,505
We'll never catch an animal.

629
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,132
The squirrel'd be up in a tree,
they'd think we were.

630
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,926
No, no, no.

631
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:34,470
-We'll build a hot-air balloon and--
-No.

632
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,013
-We'll smash them.
-Yeah, yeah.

633
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,598
I'm gonna smash it. On a rock.

634
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,684
-Right here. Good thinking.
-Good idea. Yes, destroy it.

635
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,062
-Get it.
-Die. Yes.

636
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,900
-What the fuck was that?
-I was trying to hit that tree. I missed.

637
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,277
-What tree?
-That one.

638
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,988
Why didn't you smash it
on a rock like a normal person?

639
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,991
I don't know. How often does
somebody smash things? I'm rusty.

640
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,119
Did you at least see
where it landed?

641
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,912
I don't know. Call it.

642
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,791
Call it? With what?
My phone has been smashed.

643
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,586
I bet they can't even triangulate
those things.

644
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:11,215
Well, you convinced me they can.
You were very convincing back there.

645
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,009
Hey. Fine. I'll go find it. Fuck.

646
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,303
-Do you see it?
-See what?

647
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,722
The phone, you idiot.

648
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,684
Why are we here?
This place is so fucking scary.

649
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:24,145
At least I had an idea.
You didn't, so shut up.

650
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,064
That's not true. I had two ideas.
Nowhere and Quiznos.

651
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,233
-What?
-What was that?

652
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,484
-What?
-What is that?

653
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:33,529
-What?
-I hear something.

654
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:34,738
What?

655
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,782
I don't know. Do you hear that?

656
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,326
Dude, I literally hear nothing.

657
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,245
Oh, fuck!

658
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:44,790
Where are you going? What are
you running from? Return to me now!

659
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,377
Help me!

660
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,880
Tell him to get away from me!

661
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,215
I'm scared of this darkness!
I surrender!

662
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,217
-Go away! Go away!
-I'm unarmed!

663
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,054
-This isn't funny anymore!
-Dale!

664
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,973
-Fall back!
-Save me!

665
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,154
Oh, shit.

666
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:18,199
Car.

667
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,542
Open it! Open it!
Open the door! Open it!

668
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,961
-Unlock it.
-I can't unlock it.

669
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,422
What are you doing?
Watch the upholstery.

670
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:37,259
-Go! I saw something!
-No! What did you see? Shut up!

671
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:40,930
Shut the fuck-- Shut up, man!

672
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,390
I heard something,
then I saw something.

673
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,267
You didn't hear anything, man.

674
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,269
Well, I saw something.

675
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:54,443
And you're telling me that guy
in the little short shorts...

676
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:55,986
-...broke your nose?
-Right.

677
00:35:56,154 --> 00:36:00,074
The BeDazzler guy
broke your nose, tough man?

678
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:17,091
Wake up. Get up. Wake up.

679
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,052
How did I get on you?

680
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,471
I wonder.

681
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,352
Watch finally broke.

682
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,145
Crazy. What time is it?

683
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:35,276
That can't be right.

684
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,612
It couldn't be 3 in the morning,
could it?

685
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,864
It's 3:00 right now?

686
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,575
Holy shit, man!

687
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:46,245
We were supposed to be at Red's
at noon, man. What if he's gone?

688
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:47,871
No, it's daylight-savings, so--

689
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,041
-So it's only 2:00.
-Oh, no, it went forward an hour.

690
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:55,504
It's 4 o'-fucking-clock?
Fuck me. No, man. That's bad.

691
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,841
Shit. We slept for, like, 18 hours.

692
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:01,552
My bubbe--
Man, my bubbe's gonna be so pissed.

693
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,803
Shit.

694
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:04,805
We gotta call Red.

695
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,558
Okay. How?

696
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,768
We'll go to a pay phone.

697
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:13,188
No, I can't.
His number is in my phone.

698
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,357
Great. Well, do you remember
where he lives?

699
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:16,859
Yeah, I know where he lives.

700
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:19,153
What are you insinuating?
Like, I'm forgetful?

701
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,738
"Insinuating." Good word.

702
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,197
Do you know what that means?

703
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:25,367
-I do, believe it or not.
-It means, like, "to seem like."

704
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,331
Let's roll. I'm done with the woods.
Let's go.

705
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,499
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here.

706
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:36,545
Okay. Let's go. No. It's not working.
The battery's dead.

707
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,380
Wait.

708
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:40,674
What do you mean, it's dead?

709
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:44,386
What do I mean? I mean
the battery's dead. The battery's dead.

710
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,221
What do you mean,
the battery's dead?

711
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,891
How can I explain this
to you differently?

712
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:52,061
The battery is dead.
It ceased to live.

713
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:55,731
It's deceased now. The car
needs a battery to start, Saul.

714
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,651
How did this happen?

715
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,570
Well, we clearly fell asleep
with the battery on, and--

716
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,697
Oh, man. To talk radio?

717
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,241
-Yes, talk radio.
-It's so boring, man.

718
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,203
-Okay, okay.
-The car just committed suicide.

719
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,497
Shut up, man. I have an idea now.

720
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:12,915
We're gonna go.

721
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,793
We'll walk back to the road.
We'll hitchhike.

722
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,920
Someone will pick us up,
take us to Red's.

723
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:21,298
Red will tell us everything's fine,
everything will go back to normal.

724
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:22,758
How does that sound? Good?

725
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,760
-That's a good idea.
-Keep our heads on.

726
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:27,513
If we just keep thinking like this,
we're fucking gravy.

727
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:29,723
-All right. I'm in.
-Let's do it.

728
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,567
-Can I have my jacket back, please?
-Yeah.

729
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,112
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

730
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,197
Thanks for taking care of it.

731
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,240
Look, it's like my thumb is my cock.

732
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,912
That's not gonna get us a ride, man.

733
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,921
Here's good.

734
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,512
Thanks for the smooth sailing,
Sharid.

735
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,264
You're welcome.

736
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,772
-You're sure we can trust this guy?
-Yo, Red.

737
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:01,565
Who is it?

738
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:05,402
-It's Bruce.
-Bruce? Who the fuck is this?

739
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,739
-Saul. What's up?
-Who do you think it is?

740
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:09,948
Who's this?

741
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,075
I'm Dale, Mr. Red. Nice to meet you.

742
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,285
Dale who?

743
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,412
It's best if you don't know
my full name.

744
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,872
Dale Denton. He's with me.

745
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,374
Dale Denton. Nice to meet you, bro.

746
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,252
-Hold on. Let me get this lock, okay?
-You better.

747
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,713
-Get in here.
-Coming in.

748
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:27,591
-Y'all wanna buy some drugs?
-Frisk me.

749
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,843
-What's up? What's up?
-Get it.

750
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,929
Look at that, huh?

751
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:35,349
-What's up, players?
-What's up?

752
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:40,145
I've been up in here trying to get
a motherfucking scholarship. Chilling.

753
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:41,730
What's up with the clothes?

754
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,775
We were camping.

755
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,401
-Camping?
-Yeah.

756
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,655
Is your lip okay, man?

757
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:51,865
-You been crying?
-Oh, my lip.

758
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:53,992
It's a cold sore.

759
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,579
Never had one before,
so I started to cry.

760
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,958
I think it's a lot worse
than it looks, though.

761
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,710
Cold sore?
Does that mean fucking herpes?

762
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,380
Yeah. Yes, it does.

763
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:09,383
Fucking sick, man. You know
how many joints we've shared?

764
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:12,261
I know. I'm a disgusting person.

765
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,929
Herpes is for life, bro.

766
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:17,599
I'm gonna try to definitely put
some sort of medical ointment on it.

767
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,394
Been taking Vicodin.
Doesn't really take swelling down.

768
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:22,271
It's from that time. I told you, man.

769
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,816
You ate that lollipop out of that
stripper's snatch. You wanted to do it.

770
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,652
Out of her vagina. Remember
what you did? What did you do?

771
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,114
You ate a box of Nerds
out of her butthole.

772
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:35,742
You fucking said you wouldn't tell.
You sowed your own poison, man.

773
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,579
Dudes, seriously, we're here
for a reason. Just ask him.

774
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:42,958
Chill. I'm boiling some eggs over here.
We got a lot of time to hang out.

775
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:44,877
-I'm making a fucking cake.
-No shit.

776
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,295
Can I have a piece of that?

777
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,755
-Don't ask for a piece.
-I can't have a piece?

778
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,424
No, you can't. This is private.

779
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,342
Do you know what today is?

780
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,470
-Tuesday.
-This is my cat's birthday today.

781
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,807
I don't see a cat in here. I'm sorry.
You let it out by accident?

782
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,934
No, because he died
three months ago, okay?

783
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,436
So now who's the funny guy?

784
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:03,770
Sorry.

785
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,022
Today is his birthday...

786
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,525
...and it is a tradition
that on his birthday...

787
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,987
...I get up extra early and make him
his favorite kind of dessert.

788
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,489
Don't worry, bro.
Your cat's going to heaven.

789
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,325
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe he went to heaven.

790
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,619
He was a little fucker.
Could've gone to hell.

791
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:19,995
What are we talk--? Guys--

792
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,663
Ask him. Just ask him, okay?

793
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,957
Ask what? Just come straight.
What's up?

794
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,126
-Yeah, right.
-Lay it on him.

795
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,253
We need to know--

796
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,172
We need to know
about your source.

797
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,673
-Ted.
-Ted Jones.

798
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:35,510
See, Dale, here,
is a protest servant.

799
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,137
I'm not. That's not what I am.

800
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:40,432
He's not that,
but he was outside Ted's house--

801
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,604
Don't-- Look, we don't want
to bring you in to what we're in, okay?

802
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:48,523
You don't want any trouble.
We don't wanna give you trouble.

803
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,109
It's probably best
you don't know the whole story.

804
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:54,154
-Don't think I can handle danger?
-What are you talking about?

805
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,198
-You can.
-I totally can.

806
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:58,158
And for you
to come into my house...

807
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:01,536
...and not tell secrets
because you think you're saving me...

808
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,414
...well, in reality, it just makes
you look like a dumb-ass.

809
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,832
Look at this. See this?

810
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,794
You see that?
There's no hair under here, okay?

811
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:10,420
What's the significance of that?

812
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,382
It makes me aerodynamic
when I fight. I can take danger.

813
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:17,260
Okay, has anyone called asking
about Saul or the Pineapple Express?

814
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,888
That's all we need to know.

815
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,559
Is it "uh-huh" or "uh-uh"?

816
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,728
-It's "uh-uh."
-There it is, man.

817
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:29,815
Cleared. Over.

818
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:31,942
Everything's fine. I told you, bro.

819
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,777
We had a wacky night
in the woods...

820
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,571
...but we both can put that
behind us like adults.

821
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,865
Now it's time
to get super-duper high.

822
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,492
Got that bong I got in Tel Aviv?

823
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,994
"Bong Mitzvah." Hit it up.

824
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,870
Yes.

825
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,580
There you go.

826
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,749
Why don't you follow his lead
and chill out?

827
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:50,043
I'm chill.
I'm chill as a cucumber, man.

828
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,754
-You don't seem chill.
-More chill than you.

829
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,172
You're more chill than me?

830
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,883
Look at what I'm wearing. Kimono.
What are you wearing?

831
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,927
-Suit.
-Yeah. Exactly.

832
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:02,305
I don't know what's up with you,
but I don't know if I like you.

833
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,599
Well, I don't know
if I like you either, man.

834
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,102
Well, that's your loss,
because I'm a great friend.

835
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,022
I'm gonna use the telefono
to call my wife, okay?

836
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,356
-Give her a call.
-I will.

837
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:12,149
-Go ahead.
-Don't pay attention to what I'm saying.

838
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,233
-Go ahead.
-Sit on my couch...

839
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,485
...my chillastic couch, and chill out.

840
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,363
-I'm chilling right here.
-Don't listen to what I'm saying.

841
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,866
-This is private. This is my wife.
-I'm listening.

842
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,243
I'm not trying to be enemies.
I don't wanna be.

843
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:25,078
-I wanna be friends.
-Well, then good.

844
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:26,872
-I wanna be best friends.
-Come here.

845
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,291
-Shake my fucking hand.
-Shake my hand. Okay.

846
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:31,418
-See, we can be friends.
-I'm feeling it.

847
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:34,796
-You feel that? We can be best friends.
-I'm looking through you, man.

848
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:36,381
I'm looking through you too...

849
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:39,342
...and I see I need to paint
the spot on the wall behind you.

850
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,261
-I'm looking through you.
-Transparent.

851
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:45,098
-I see your intentions.
-I see your intestines and intentions.

852
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,435
-What'd I have for dinner last night?
-Cake.

853
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:50,729
I'll be right back.
Make this phone call.

854
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:54,232
Bullshit.

855
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:56,777
No, no, no.

856
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,445
-Liar.
-What are you doing, man?

857
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,072
He's a liar. He's lying to us, man.
He's lying to us.

858
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,240
No, he's not.

859
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,284
He knows my name.
He's acting weird.

860
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,411
We can't let him
phone anyone, man.

861
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:09,039
Freaking out. You're paranoid.
Give him the phone.

862
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,457
I do not trust you, sir.

863
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,375
-You're paranoid.
-He's acting weird.

864
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,544
Red, I'm sorry, bro.

865
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,296
-Jesus!
-Holy cock.

866
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:17,631
Fuck you!

867
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:19,466
What are you doing, man?
He's sorry.

868
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:20,926
Oh, Jesus.

869
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,013
Herpes!

870
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:27,307
I don't wanna have to do this.

871
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:28,642
Red, you're crazy, man.

872
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,811
You brought the devil
into my house.

873
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,687
-We're friends.
-I know we are.

874
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,940
-That's why it sucks.
-Are you on meth again?

875
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:39,110
Dale, he's hurting me!

876
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,821
Toilet.

877
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,489
Flush.

878
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:45,867
What we do in this life
echoes in eternity.

879
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:48,370
True!

880
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:04,511
He's going for the phone
to call Ted!

881
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,013
Stay out of here!

882
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:12,269
Red, don't do it!

883
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,022
-Red!
-You assholes.

884
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,774
You ruined my portable phone.

885
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:20,151
-Teamwork.
-Yes.

886
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,530
You're gonna break the door.
Gonna pay for it?

887
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:28,869
Fuck.

888
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,412
Phone.

889
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,958
-Let go! Let go! Let go!
-What the hell--?

890
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:37,669
I let go, now just get this
goddamn door off of me!

891
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:39,337
Tell us everything, now!

892
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,839
Said they were gonna kill me.

893
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:43,008
What did you tell Ted?

894
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,093
He's crushing my balls.
Crushing my balls.

895
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:46,720
Smash them.

896
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:47,929
Fuck!

897
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:49,514
Time out. Time out.

898
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:50,891
Time out. Time out.

899
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,809
-Truce.
-Time in. Fuck you.

900
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,769
-Stop!
-Cheater!

901
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,730
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Red!

902
00:46:56,898 --> 00:46:59,316
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Get--

903
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:01,568
Fuck.

904
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,571
God--

905
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,031
Fuck!

906
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,199
-Take it, motherfucker!
-Time out!

907
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,120
Fuck!

908
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:16,958
No! No, no, no!

909
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,002
Where you going, huh?

910
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,254
Where do you think you're going,
Mr. Wiggles?

911
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:24,174
-Come on. Get back here.
-Saul, help me! Help me!

912
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,759
He's punching my bum!

913
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:28,678
I'm done with this.
Let's talk. Let's try words.

914
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:32,515
Use words! No! No! No!

915
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:37,103
You okay, man?

916
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,773
-I'll get you another bong.
-It's my cat's birthday.

917
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,817
Happy birthday.

918
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:44,361
-All right?
-Thank you.

919
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,821
I think there's a package
in the mailbox.

920
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,074
This ends now!

921
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,579
Oh, shit.

922
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:56,539
Was that too much?

923
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,377
Can't get the edge.

924
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,796
Wait. Got it. Got it.

925
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:04,130
Hey, Dale.

926
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,634
Think we're gonna have to kill him?
I don't think I'm capable of murder.

927
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,010
I don't think I am either.

928
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:11,972
Maybe we could just convince him
to kill himself.

929
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,557
Or, just not say anything.

930
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:18,937
We need to find out
everything he knows, okay?

931
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,356
Wake up.

932
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,024
Hey, what's up, dudes?

933
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:26,277
What's up? Tell us everything now.

934
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,487
Talk, Red.

935
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:29,990
I'm gonna flex and bust out of here.

936
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:35,412
Trapped.

937
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,830
Not happening, Red.

938
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:39,499
Okay. All right. Okay, I'll talk.

939
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:44,170
Ted Jones, he knows you witnessed
the murder. He found your roach.

940
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,340
He sent two guys over here,
Budlofsky and Matheson.

941
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:49,843
Two real big son of a bitches.

942
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:51,761
They're basically
out to kill you guys.

943
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,556
They're gonna kill me too,
unless I turn y'all over.

944
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:56,558
So you guys are basically fucked.

945
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:59,352
How many cops does he have
on his payroll? Tell us.

946
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,313
-Well, there's the woman cop, Carol.
-That's the lady cop.

947
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,734
I don't know. He could have a bunch.
This dude is super well-connected.

948
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,862
And he has a really awesome
hideout too. It's pretty badass.

949
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,613
-Oh, shit.
-What else?

950
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,991
He's at a war right now
with the Asians.

951
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,617
They're in a drug war right now.

952
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,120
Asians? What Asians?
Indians are technically Asian.

953
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,872
-It's true.
-What Asians?

954
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,876
I don't know. What? Chinese?
Or Korean or--

955
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:24,044
Vietcong?

956
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,880
Yeah, little-- Just little Asian people.

957
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:32,677
Like, the Asians with the guns
and the drugs, and not his friends.

958
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:33,887
-Ding-dong.
-Hey, Red!

959
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:35,388
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, they're here.

960
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:36,890
They're here to kill me.

961
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:40,935
Okay, I know I sold y'all out. I've been
a son of a bitch and a shitty friend.

962
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,521
Saul, I'm talking to you.
Dale, you're a new friend.

963
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,899
I can make it up.
I forgot, "bro's before ho's."

964
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:48,526
Just go out the back porch.
I won't say anything.

965
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,070
-I'll cover for you.
-Thanks.

966
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,988
No sweat.

967
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:58,369
It was Dale Denton.
Dale Denton and Saul.

968
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:01,706
They're on the back porch.
You can catch them if you hurry. Go.

969
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,960
Hey. In here.

970
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,129
I've gotta get to a phone. Come on.

971
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:09,923
-We should hide.
-Why?

972
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:12,008
If Red tells Ted's guys
about my name...

973
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:13,927
...then they'll go to my apartment.

974
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:17,806
There, I have Angie's name. They'll
put that together, find her. Let's go.

975
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,474
No. I think we should stay.

976
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:21,976
-Why?
-I'm in the dumpster already.

977
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:25,230
Well, then, get out.
Come on, you're already dirty.

978
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:29,692
-They're gone.
-Well, find out what he knows

979
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,361
Red, it's your last chance, man.

980
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,321
You gonna give us something
we can use?

981
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:36,908
Matheson, you gotta be kidding me.
I mean, what more do you want?

982
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:39,160
I told you that the guy's name
is Dale Denton.

983
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:40,954
He's obviously working with Saul.

984
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:43,123
They came in here,
busted my house to shit.

985
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,958
They kicked the hell out of me...

986
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:47,293
...duct-taped me
to my grandfather's wheelchair.

987
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,963
What more do you want?
Want me to read your horoscope?

988
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:53,800
-You hear that, Ted?
-Ask if either of them were Asian.

989
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,469
-What skin color were they?
-They were white people.

990
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:58,721
Denton might've been a Jew.
I don't know.

991
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,057
I don't judge people
based on things like that.

992
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,601
Obviously. We're friends.

993
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,061
Ted, you hear him?

994
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:09,149
Dale Denton: not Asian.
All right. Kill Red.

995
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,819
Listen, I would appreciate it
if both y'all would take your shoes off.

996
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:15,488
This is brand-new carpet.
You're tracking mud in here.

997
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,323
Matheson, you got
British Knights on.

998
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,492
I ain't seen anybody wear them
since 1987.

999
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:22,954
What the hell are you doing?

1000
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:24,831
Ted told me to kill him.

1001
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:27,834
Well, how about
a little fucking discretion here?

1002
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,878
See? See? See, right there.
You see that?

1003
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,171
-You catch it?
-See what?

1004
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,424
You used to not give
a fuck about discretion.

1005
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:37,635
I seen you pull somebody's
jawbone off. I seen it.

1006
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,888
You was ruthless.

1007
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,432
You was ruthless, man.

1008
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,685
What the fuck, man?
You shot me in my stomach.

1009
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,062
I'm gonna die now probably.

1010
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:51,649
I had you all over here for dinner.
Fish tacos.

1011
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,359
This how you do me?

1012
00:51:56,906 --> 00:51:58,740
So, what did Budlofsky
and Matheson say?

1013
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:00,533
I don't know.

1014
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,953
There's this guy, Saul...

1015
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,457
...something, selling weed who works
with some guy, Dale Denton.

1016
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,000
That's all he got out of him.

1017
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:12,587
Do you think he has anything to do
with the guy that we shot?

1018
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:14,631
Well, did he say anything else?

1019
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:18,051
Saul mentioned something about
"going to the casino."

1020
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:20,386
-Weird.
-"Going to the casino"?

1021
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,639
The Asians own the casino, Ted.

1022
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:26,226
-I need another beer.
-He's gotta be working for them.

1023
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:30,146
Maybe after we popped that guy,
they hired this outside guy, Dale--

1024
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:32,482
What's his name? Denton?
--to finish the job.

1025
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:33,983
Maybe

1026
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:37,278
Maybe. Well, I'll be back in an hour

1027
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:40,949
I'll have everything there is to know
about this Dale Denton guy.

1028
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:44,535
Who he's screwing,
who's his mother, everything

1029
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,329
I have to take a shit.

1030
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,333
Wait. Where are we going?

1031
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:54,796
I gotta-- I gotta get to Angie's.
I have to make sure she's okay.

1032
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:57,423
What about my bubbe?
Don't think they'll go after her.

1033
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,176
I mean, she has
a different last name.

1034
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,678
Belogus.

1035
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:05,181
I don't know. We should get out of
the middle of the road. Come on.

1036
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,157
You guys can wait
as long as you want...

1037
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:27,078
...but one minute from right now,
I'm gonna eat some food.

1038
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:30,123
And you can call it rude.
You can call it whatever you want.

1039
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:33,710
You can be polite with your clean
plates, but I'm gonna be eating food.

1040
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:34,919
Dad, he'll be here.

1041
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:38,131
I'm going in the other room and eat it,
check my e-mail. I'm done.

1042
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:41,301
Honey, we're at the table.
No one's going to leave the table.

1043
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,848
-Okay. This is it.
-All right. Let's do this.

1044
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:48,641
No, no, no. I'm going alone.

1045
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:50,852
-No.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1046
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,896
-I wanna meet Angie.
-You'll meet her later, man. Look.

1047
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,649
Look, I need you to stay out here.
Keep guard, okay?

1048
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:58,568
-It's important. Watch my back.
-Okay.

1049
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,862
-Thanks.
-All right. Just be yourself.

1050
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,739
I'll keep guard.

1051
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,824
Hey.

1052
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,827
Shit.

1053
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:09,537
Oh, no.

1054
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:10,747
Hey, Dale.

1055
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,833
-Hello, Dale.
-Hey.

1056
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,043
Dinner.

1057
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:20,131
This is the dinner you invited me to.
That was tonight. That's why I'm here.

1058
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:21,591
Sit. Please.

1059
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:24,052
Of course. Hi.

1060
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,845
-Hi.
-Shannon.

1061
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,638
-Intros.
-Great to meet you.

1062
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,516
-Robert, if I'm not mistaken.
-Sit down, so we can eat.

1063
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,144
-Hi, Dale.
-Hey. Okay.

1064
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:34,812
-What happened to you?
-Nothing.

1065
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,856
I'm supposed to be here right now.

1066
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:38,149
So I'm here.

1067
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:41,486
-You're all dirty and bleeding.
-No, I'm not. I'm here for dinner.

1068
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:45,490
-You have scratches on your forehead.
-Dude, you smell like shit.

1069
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,326
-Dale, what happened to you?
-I was in the woods.

1070
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:51,662
-In the woods?
-Yeah. Isn't that weird? I was--

1071
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,706
-I was in the woods.
-What were you doing?

1072
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:56,209
I bird-watch. I don't.

1073
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:59,295
No, I don't.
Look, I'm gonna come clean.

1074
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:03,132
I witnessed a murder, okay?

1075
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,218
I saw someone
murder someone else...

1076
00:55:05,386 --> 00:55:07,887
...and I think
they've been following me.

1077
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:10,348
There's a good chance
they went to my apartment...

1078
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:12,225
...where Angie has a lot of things.

1079
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:15,353
Her yearbooks, report cards,
her cell number is written...

1080
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:16,813
...and it's on my fridge.

1081
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,607
So they could then find this house.
They could come here.

1082
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:21,484
We should call the police
right away.

1083
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,736
We can't. The police
were the murderers.

1084
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:26,447
We can't call the police.
They were the murderers.

1085
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:29,283
Angie, I swear to God,
you do something or I'm gonna--

1086
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,536
-So fucked up.
-No. Don't let him "gonna."

1087
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:35,248
No, don't wanna. Look,
we gotta get the F out of here.

1088
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:38,042
Let's go. We need to begin
to prematurely evacuate.

1089
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:40,711
-Are you high?
-What? No. I'm not high. Why--?

1090
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,713
You are high as a fucking kite.

1091
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,340
I'm not high. Let's go.

1092
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:46,592
We're not going.
I'm coming back in a minute.

1093
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,011
You know what I'm coming back with?
With a gun.

1094
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,431
You better be out.
I'm not fucking with you.

1095
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,599
Your gun? His gun?

1096
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,227
Why do you--? Don't get a gun.
Why would he bear arms?

1097
00:55:56,395 --> 00:56:00,398
No, we need to go.
Everyone, I'm leading the parade.

1098
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:18,416
I just want you to know,
I always got your back.

1099
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,296
And I'm glad we're partners.

1100
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,512
-This is so exciting.
-Okay, okay.

1101
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,806
Is this where you're parked?
Let's sally forth.

1102
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,391
Who is after you, after Angie?

1103
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:38,978
They're drug dealers. I have reason
to believe that they're drug dealers.

1104
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:41,606
What are you talking about?
You're out of your mind.

1105
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:44,192
-I know it sounds crazy.
-Hide.

1106
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:47,778
Dale! Dale! Dale! It's happening.
I was eating a Fruit Roll--

1107
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:49,238
-Why'd you do that?
-God!

1108
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,157
-Get it!
-Jesus! Okay! Just stop!

1109
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:54,577
-Angie, what did you do?
-He's one of the drug dealers!

1110
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,871
-He's my pot dealer.
-He's your pot dealer?

1111
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:58,164
-I got it.
-Get it.

1112
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,085
-Gross. Are you okay?
-Dale, who is this?

1113
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:06,255
-He's my-- Oh, shit. Get down.
-Dad!

1114
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,220
What was that?

1115
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,472
That was a gunshot.

1116
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:20,353
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

1117
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:22,480
-He's with me.
-I'm the good drug dealer.

1118
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:25,024
-Put the gun down!
-Put down the gun.

1119
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:26,943
You assholes
do exactly what I say...

1120
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,904
...or I will take you outside
and fuck you in the street.

1121
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:31,822
-No, don't.
-Don't fuck us anywhere.

1122
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:40,540
-Where's your gun?
-I don't need it.

1123
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,417
Kill motherfuckers with my hands.

1124
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:47,964
Get out your goddamn gun.
You're making me uncomfortable.

1125
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,560
Anybody out there?

1126
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:06,023
Fucking hide-and-seek.

1127
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,817
Say, now.

1128
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,697
Hey, the food's still warm.

1129
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:16,951
Love it.

1130
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,370
I found a bloody fork.

1131
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:23,165
It's fucking freaky, man.
They could still be here.

1132
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,585
Did you check the rest of the house?

1133
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,963
I'm about to check that bathroom,
I know that much.

1134
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:31,424
Come on, Saul. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1135
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:34,093
Yes. We made it.
We're all safe, guys. We made it.

1136
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:35,595
-What are you doing?
-Get out.

1137
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,472
Get out of my car.
I can't believe you think it's an option.

1138
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,766
Okay. Okay. That makes sense.
It makes sense.

1139
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:43,060
Come on, let's go.
It makes sense. He's right.

1140
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:46,647
-Stay away from my family. Period.
-So where do we go? What do we do?

1141
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:49,150
Go to the Days Inn
downtown, okay?

1142
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:51,444
Use a fake name.

1143
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,946
Garagely. I'll contact you.

1144
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:57,116
I don't know who these people are,
what they're capable of...

1145
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:59,952
...but I will keep you guys safe,
I promise that.

1146
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,454
Fuck off, loser.

1147
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:07,001
Angie, you're a fucking idiot.
I say that with love.

1148
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,339
Okay, you call this Mocha Milkshake.

1149
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:14,967
This one here, English Breeze.
Charge $40 for these.

1150
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:16,802
-Forty?
-Yeah.

1151
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:22,433
This one, Da Vinci's Brush.
Call this one Bumble Bush.

1152
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:26,562
And this here, Spanish Trampoline.

1153
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,981
Crazy with them names, ain't you, T?

1154
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:31,359
What the fuck is--?
What is it, Spanish--?

1155
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:34,070
Spanish Trampoline.
Used to call it Spanish Mudflaps...

1156
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,697
...but Troy likes to trampoline
so Spanish Trampoline.

1157
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:39,075
-Almost the same number of syllables.
-How much?

1158
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,327
-Forty-five for these last three.
-All right.

1159
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:44,205
-And leave me the best stash.
-All right.

1160
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:46,415
It's Pineapple Express.
Get your ass up.

1161
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,126
Yup, of course.

1162
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,173
So get this:

1163
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:55,925
We triangulated the cells.

1164
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:59,679
They smashed one, threw the other
in the woods to try to distract us.

1165
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,847
It took an hour for Jared to find it.

1166
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,725
And then he said
that he found Denton's car...

1167
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:07,269
...filled with all these
strange disguises.

1168
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,690
A powdered wig,
a sombrero, leotards.

1169
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,733
I mean, what the fuck
does that mean?

1170
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:15,403
Why don't I just call the Asians
and talk to Cheung?

1171
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,863
Why beat around the bush,
you know?

1172
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,501
Hello?

1173
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:31,711
Cheung, it's Ted

1174
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,170
Record this conversation.

1175
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:37,550
Ted, what a surprise.
What can I do for you?

1176
01:00:37,718 --> 01:00:41,721
Well, Cheung, my friend,
let me tell you.

1177
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:45,808
You know, we both know
that you sent one of your very skilled...

1178
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:49,979
...hit men over here last night
and I and my colleague...

1179
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:53,315
...made a little decoration
on our window. Should have seen it.

1180
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:56,861
We painted the wall with his brain
Painted it.

1181
01:00:57,028 --> 01:01:00,698
And now this Dale Denton guy?
You serious?

1182
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:04,452
Just stop it, okay? Stop it or you're
asking for war. Do you want a war?

1183
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,870
-What?
-What?

1184
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,455
-Hello?
-Troy?

1185
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:12,209
Dad! Get off the phone. I told you
I'm gonna call some hot bitches later...

1186
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:14,879
-...and this is the time.
-I got you your own line...

1187
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:17,298
...so you would stay off mine.
Get off the phone.

1188
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:20,926
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm not a little kid, I'm a man!

1189
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:24,513
And from this point forward, I'm
not taking any of your fucking shit

1190
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:28,976
I love you, Dad, but the dynamic
in our relationship is about to change

1191
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:31,395
Troy, do me a favor,
get off the fucking phone!

1192
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:35,107
-Shit.
-So you have a son

1193
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:37,276
Sounds like a very nice boy.

1194
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:40,237
All right, you listen to me, Cheung
you motherfucker!

1195
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,865
It is on! We're coming at you
with everything we got!

1196
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:45,576
It's on, so you better get your head
out of your ass...

1197
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:47,411
...and be ready for everything!

1198
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:49,455
You are fucking dead!

1199
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:51,707
You are so dumb.

1200
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:55,377
Do you have any idea
how weak you just made us look?

1201
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,924
Goddamn it!

1202
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:01,592
Totally sweet.

1203
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:04,303
Ted Jones is slipping.

1204
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:08,098
We shall strike now with full force.

1205
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:12,019
Your brother's death
will not be in vain.

1206
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:18,192
I gotta say, I've had, like,
a lot of weed dealers in my day.

1207
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,945
You're the coolest I've ever had.
They were all dicks.

1208
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,614
-Really? Thanks, man.
-No problem.

1209
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:26,242
I really appreciate it.
That means a lot to me.

1210
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:30,204
It's, like, you're the first guy that I ever
sold to that I became friends with.

1211
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:34,291
They say, like, "Don't dip the pen
in company ink."

1212
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:37,461
I'm totally glad
I dipped in your ink, bro.

1213
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:40,172
Yeah.

1214
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:45,469
We should get out of town.
That's probably our next move.

1215
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:47,304
Just get on a bus and leave, right?

1216
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,473
Get bus tickets.

1217
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:53,102
Go to the next town.
Contact some police.

1218
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,521
You know what I was saying?
Like, I'm totally--

1219
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:57,648
You're glad you dipped your pen
in my ink.

1220
01:02:57,816 --> 01:02:59,984
But we should get bus tickets
and leave, right?

1221
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,360
What?

1222
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:04,655
Get on the bus? Leave?
Buy bus tickets?

1223
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:08,158
I only have, like, 50 bucks.
I don't think that'll even buy one ticket.

1224
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,035
What about your sack?

1225
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:13,080
Oh, man, it's fucking killing me.
I feel like I popped one.

1226
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:17,209
No. That's unfortunate,
but that's not what I'm talking about.

1227
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:18,836
I mean, like, the sack of weed.

1228
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:21,088
Couldn't we just,
like, sell some weed...

1229
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:22,923
...get some cash
and buy bus tickets?

1230
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:27,136
-Of course, man. That's what I do.
-That's what you do. Fucking A.

1231
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:28,012
Okay, so you're gonna buy tickets
for Saturday's game, right?

1232
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:30,097
Okay, so you're gonna buy tickets
for Saturday's game, right?

1233
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:31,849
These guys are amazing.

1234
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,726
What the fuck do you want?

1235
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:36,061
You guys wanna buy some chronic?

1236
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:44,361
What's this stuff called again?

1237
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,530
Pineapple Express.
They said it eight times.

1238
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:49,908
-Yeah, but don't call it that.
-Yeah, that's not what it's called.

1239
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,953
-Call it Banana Boat.
-Make sure you leave it at weed too.

1240
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:56,040
This can be a gateway drug.
Don't wanna move on to other things.

1241
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:58,709
-Cocaine. Don't do that.
-We don't fuck around.

1242
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:02,921
-Don't worry. Don't tell us what to do.
-Inhale it, Chachi. Inhale it.

1243
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,506
Who the fuck's Chachi?

1244
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,485
-How much money you guys got?
-Come on.

1245
01:04:24,653 --> 01:04:27,029
You each get as much
as you can grab with one hand.

1246
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:29,490
Go easy. That's a big handful, guys.
Come on.

1247
01:04:29,658 --> 01:04:33,327
-Keep it on the down-low.
-Don't tell anybody where you got it.

1248
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:37,665
You got it from Saul-- I mean, you got
it from Santiago and Dunbar.

1249
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:40,668
-Go. Come on.
-Go, go. Vamoose!

1250
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:43,837
You fucking did it, man.

1251
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:46,674
You are a good salesman.
You got it in you, man.

1252
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:49,259
I'm about to go get some
celebratory Slushees.

1253
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:50,928
Get some burritos or something.

1254
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:53,097
Something to drink too.
Something good.

1255
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:55,683
See you, man. Nice.

1256
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:05,275
Don't move. Don't you move.
This shit hurts.

1257
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,069
Don't move. What's in your hand?

1258
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:08,987
It's weed. It's a joint. It's a roach.

1259
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,864
-Right here.
-I was just smoking--

1260
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:13,575
I thought it was decriminalized,
to be honest with you.

1261
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:17,996
I have horrible anorexia,
and it helps my appetite. I'm so sorry.

1262
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:22,960
Look, selling narcotics to my students
is not decriminalized.

1263
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:26,130
-Okay. I understand.
-I'm the liaison officer for this school.

1264
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:29,383
And guess what? I just saw three
students walking from back here...

1265
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:32,886
...with their eyes as red
as the devil's dick. You're busted.

1266
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:40,978
-On the hood. On the hood.
-Okay, okay.

1267
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:42,855
I'm on the hood. Come on.

1268
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:45,816
-Stand still. Stand still.
-I'm still. I'm sorry.

1269
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:49,695
You better hope it's clean.
Better hope ain't shit on this record.

1270
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:52,698
I'm gonna put my foot
up in your ass.

1271
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,829
Oh, big sexy with glasses.

1272
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:04,626
This is Officer Barbara. Requesting
an update on fugitive Dale Denton.

1273
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:09,339
I repeat, requesting update on Dale
Denton. I have the fugitive in custody.

1274
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:11,508
425, 425, what's your location?

1275
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,344
You going down.

1276
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,597
What? What do you mean--?
Why am I going down?

1277
01:06:16,765 --> 01:06:19,016
What did that thing tell you?
What are you doing?

1278
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:21,435
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

1279
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:24,104
I wasn't doing things.
Why do you hate me so much?

1280
01:06:24,272 --> 01:06:26,690
Hit-and-run, Mr. Denton.
Hit-and-run.

1281
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:28,358
Two parked cars, two nights ago.

1282
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,569
One of them was actually
a police cruiser.

1283
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:33,614
You gotta be the dumbest
motherfucker in captivity.

1284
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:36,658
It's the lady cop.
They got Dale. Oh, shit.

1285
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,702
So you're telling me
you saw Ted Jones...

1286
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,662
...and a police officer
shoot somebody?

1287
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,331
-Exactly.
-And you saw it?

1288
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:44,500
-Yes, do you believe me?
-Give me a minute.

1289
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,503
-It was a woman or a man?
-It was a policewoman. A woman.

1290
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:52,549
-I think I know who that bitch was.
-Yes. I will identify that bitch.

1291
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:56,929
Thank you so much for believing me,
ma'am. Thank you.

1292
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:59,181
I'll tell you, I'll get to the bottom of it.

1293
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:01,600
I'll take this badge off,
get to the bottom of it.

1294
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:03,936
I don't work for the law.
The law works for me.

1295
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,230
I been smelling something
in this department.

1296
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:07,731
Keep your eyes on the road.

1297
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:10,150
-Gonna get to the bottom of this shit.
-Stop!

1298
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:12,736
Son of a bitch!

1299
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:16,740
Oh, no. What the hell was that?
What is that?

1300
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:26,500
No, no, no.

1301
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:29,670
-No. What are you doing?
-I'm saving you, amigo!

1302
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,090
Freeze, goddamn it!
Don't even think about it!

1303
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:35,843
This is an old-fashioned
escape mission, buddy.

1304
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,803
Stop this car!

1305
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:43,934
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1306
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:45,519
Oh, shit!

1307
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:51,108
Oh, shit! It's the lady cop!
That's the murderer! Go!

1308
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:52,860
-That's the lady cop.
-Who's that?

1309
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:56,071
I don't know. They're shooting!

1310
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:03,954
Oh, my God, they're shooting!

1311
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:05,455
Fuck.

1312
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,962
Dude!

1313
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,300
I can't see! The Slushee!

1314
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:18,635
-Turn on the wipers!
-It's not working!

1315
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:20,470
Well, kick out the window!

1316
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:23,390
-How do you drive with one foot?
-I don't know!

1317
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:27,269
Fuck! I think I pulled my groin!

1318
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:31,982
Get your foot out of there.

1319
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:34,818
She's gaining on us.
She's behind us.

1320
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:36,028
Her car's better.

1321
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,614
-Get your leg out of there. Seriously.
-I can't.

1322
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:41,658
Put it into maximum overdrive!

1323
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:46,246
Oh, no, no, no!

1324
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:49,583
Oh, shit!

1325
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:51,460
Get it out!

1326
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,505
I can't see!

1327
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:05,265
Danger! Danger!
Trees! Tree, tree! Squirrel!

1328
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:09,770
Hey, I can see
through my leg hole.

1329
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:11,688
Nice! Look out! Tree, tree, tree!

1330
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,318
You did it, man.

1331
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:19,112
All right! Look out!

1332
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,365
Oh, shit!

1333
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:23,951
Turn around! Turn around!

1334
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,044
I'm scared, Saul. I'm scared.

1335
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:36,546
-Don't worry. I'm handling this.
-Do something.

1336
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:38,966
All right, hold on. I got an idea.

1337
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:45,806
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1338
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,225
Sorry!

1339
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:51,103
What the fuck was that?

1340
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,522
Fuck. I'm sorry.
I thought she'd just go past.

1341
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,565
-Why?
-I don't know.

1342
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:14,084
Oh, my.

1343
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:20,966
Yes! Yes! We made it!
All right, man.

1344
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:23,802
-Let's get the fuck out of here.
-No. What are you doing?

1345
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,763
You forgot me, you idiot!
Come back!

1346
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:29,808
Come back! Saul!

1347
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:31,309
-Sorry, man.
-Thank you.

1348
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:35,439
-Let's go.
-Wait. Get the handcuff keys, you idiot.

1349
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:40,569
I haven't used a gun since Nam.

1350
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:44,656
Angie, you have exhibited
poor decision-making skills.

1351
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:45,824
Oh, this is my fault.

1352
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:48,744
And we have hosted violence
in our home because of it.

1353
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,871
-"Hosted violence"?
-He's a bad guy.

1354
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:53,665
You don't see that
you have stooped way, way below...

1355
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,752
-You lowered your expectations...
-...of what you are worthy of.

1356
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,838
...but this guy is so far beneath you.
You deserve much better.

1357
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:02,007
Open your heart
to someone who deserves you.

1358
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:04,217
Or don't have a boyfriend
at all for a while.

1359
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:06,178
-We're stuck in this room.
-I love him.

1360
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,971
-It's not your decision.
-Love him?

1361
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:10,807
-You don't know what love is.
-I'm gonna date him.

1362
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:13,185
-We're going to the police.
-That's what I said.

1363
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:15,520
-I know.
-He said not to go to the police.

1364
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:18,106
-You should listen. He's a lawyer.
-You come with us.

1365
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,859
-He can't possibly work in law.
-I'm not going anywhere.

1366
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:22,194
-You stay.
-We're leaving.

1367
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:24,446
-You stay in the room.
-Fine, go. Fine, go.

1368
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:27,365
And we don't need the shampoos.
Why did--?

1369
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,788
As soon as we kill
those sacks of shit tonight, Ted...

1370
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:34,706
...I'm moving on.

1371
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,545
Okay.

1372
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,297
All right.

1373
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:46,551
And I promise you
you're gonna be taken care of.

1374
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,011
As sure as shit you will.

1375
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:49,971
For now, this is what
we're gonna do.

1376
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:53,642
We're gonna go to the farm tonight,
we're gonna move tonight's shipment.

1377
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:56,394
Then tomorrow morning,
we're gonna hunt these guys down.

1378
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:59,064
Dale, Saul, the Asians.
Every last one of them.

1379
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:01,399
We're gonna fucking kill them all.

1380
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:03,610
So smile.

1381
01:12:03,778 --> 01:12:05,362
Shut up.

1382
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:12,119
Say something in Spanish.
Go ahead. I dare you. Go ahead.

1383
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:15,288
All right. Are you using protection?

1384
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:16,540
-Days Inn
-Yes.

1385
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:18,583
May I have the Garagely room,
please?

1386
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:21,336
-Hello?
-Hello, is Angie there?

1387
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:23,338
-Dale.
-Angie?

1388
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:26,216
-My God, are you okay?
-I'm good. I'm fine. I'm great

1389
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:27,717
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

1390
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,469
Okay, good. I came up with a plan

1391
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:31,805
It might sound weird at first,
but just listen.

1392
01:12:31,973 --> 01:12:34,850
Dale. You know what? Drug dealers--
Let me tell you something.

1393
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:39,938
Drug dealers are trying to kill me.
And you. And my family.

1394
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:42,983
I can't believe I'm in this situation
right now because of you...

1395
01:12:43,151 --> 01:12:46,027
...and your addiction to marijuana.
I cannot believe I'm here.

1396
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,737
I can't be addicted to marijuana

1397
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:51,074
A, I use a bong. It filters out
the addictive shit. Seriously.

1398
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:54,119
B, what does that have to do with
anything? I witnessed murder.

1399
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:55,579
And now I'm dealing with it.

1400
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:58,248
This, that's happening between us,
this is normal.

1401
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,917
This happens to every couple
dating for three months.

1402
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:02,586
-We have to work through it
-No.

1403
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:04,212
This doesn't happen to anyone.

1404
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,840
I should not be in this situation,
so fuck you.

1405
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:08,341
You know what? It's over

1406
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:11,011
Good. Fine. Whatever. It's over.

1407
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:14,514
Congratulations. Had to happen
sometime, right? Why not now?

1408
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:16,016
What the fuck does that mean?

1409
01:13:16,184 --> 01:13:18,852
It means that you are gonna go
to college next year.

1410
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:21,104
You'll get into
Godspeed You! Black Emperor..

1411
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:22,439
...and the fucking Shins

1412
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:25,192
And you'll blow a bunch of dudes
and become a lesbian...

1413
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:28,069
...and I'll be here in fucking
Clark County doing shit-all.

1414
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,655
You're gonna dump me.
So, fuck it, have a good time

1415
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:32,908
A lesbian? Fuck you, Dale!

1416
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:34,826
You never did like me anyway
did you?

1417
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:36,536
You didn't wanna meet my parents

1418
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:39,289
I always cared about you.
That's not what this is. Okay?

1419
01:13:39,457 --> 01:13:40,707
I always care about you.

1420
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,709
Why don't you ever act like it, huh?

1421
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:45,295
Why do you never act
like you care about anything?

1422
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:49,591
Because I'm high! Fuck! And it--
What do you want--? Okay. Jesus.

1423
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:51,801
Call me when I can go home.

1424
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:57,224
You lost it playing Bid Whist?
You pimp.

1425
01:13:57,391 --> 01:14:00,602
No, I'll give you more,
but you cannot gamble with it.

1426
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,480
I know, I'm sorry about the clocks.

1427
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:07,776
I couldn't remember if it was today
or tomorrow. All right, I gotta go.

1428
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:09,486
I love you.

1429
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:11,821
You wise-ass.

1430
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:15,408
Hey, you all right, man?
That sounded pretty hectic.

1431
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:17,994
I'm okay.
Let's just get the fuck out of here.

1432
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:19,246
First things first.

1433
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:24,626
-Don't do that, okay?
-Yeah. Why not?

1434
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:26,962
Why not? Car chase, gunshots.

1435
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,588
That clearly just happened...

1436
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:31,091
...because we were smoking
marijuana.

1437
01:14:31,259 --> 01:14:33,260
No, man. It happened
because those kids...

1438
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:35,595
...couldn't keep their shit
on the down-low.

1439
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:38,598
In case you haven't noticed--
Which you haven't.

1440
01:14:38,766 --> 01:14:41,268
From what I can tell,
you don't notice anything ever.

1441
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:44,771
--we are not very functional when
we're high. Which is all the time.

1442
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:47,691
Well, I don't know, man.
I think I'm functioning right now.

1443
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:50,694
I was, like, stoned when I saved you
with those Slushees.

1444
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:52,279
What do you gotta say to that?

1445
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:55,031
Well, that would be true
if you had saved me.

1446
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,324
But you didn't save me.

1447
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,410
She was gonna help,
you made things worse.

1448
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:00,453
We're wanted
for all sorts of crazy shit.

1449
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:02,622
Don't fucking get on my case,
all right?

1450
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:04,457
Only reason I started selling pot...

1451
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:07,210
...is so I could put my bubbe
in a nice retirement home.

1452
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:09,546
-She must be proud of you.
-She is proud of me.

1453
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:11,047
I'm gonna become something.

1454
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:13,758
As soon as she dies,
I'm gonna become a civil engineer.

1455
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:16,261
I'm gonna design septic tanks
for playgrounds.

1456
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:17,929
Little kids can take shits.

1457
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,723
You idiot. What the hell do you do?

1458
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:21,975
What am I gonna do?
Besides stay in my home...

1459
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:24,728
...for fear that you've designed
some object I'm around?

1460
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:28,106
I'm gonna be on the radio,
talking about life.

1461
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:30,692
-Giving lessons about life.
-Put me in my place.

1462
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,361
I'm gonna be designing buildings
and what's he doing?

1463
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,363
Boring people to death on the radio.

1464
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:39,159
You are an asshole.
That's all you are. You're an asshole.

1465
01:15:39,327 --> 01:15:41,161
-I'm not an asshole.
-You are an asshole.

1466
01:15:41,329 --> 01:15:44,331
I feel pretty sure
that I'm not an asshole.

1467
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:46,124
I'm, like, a totally nice guy.

1468
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:48,793
I'm just as nice as you are.
So don't bring that out.

1469
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:50,754
In the woods, I gave you my jacket.

1470
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:53,256
You were cold and I clothed you.

1471
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:57,010
How about in the park
when I said that you were my friend?

1472
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:58,845
You didn't say anything back.

1473
01:15:59,013 --> 01:16:01,556
Well, that's easy.
It's because we're not friends.

1474
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:03,183
You are my drug dealer.

1475
01:16:03,351 --> 01:16:05,101
There's one reason
we know each other.

1476
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:07,312
I like the drugs you sell. That's it.

1477
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,690
If you didn't sell those drugs,
I would have no idea who you were...

1478
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:14,027
...and I would be fantastic right now.
Instead of looking like this.

1479
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:18,990
That sounded mean.
Just hearing it sounded mean.

1480
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:20,700
-I didn't mean to say--
-It's out.

1481
01:16:20,868 --> 01:16:23,328
Monkey's out of the bottle, man.

1482
01:16:23,496 --> 01:16:25,538
What? That's not even
an expression.

1483
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:28,416
Pandora doesn't go back in the box.
He only comes out.

1484
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,460
I'm sorry, man. Look--

1485
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,422
-What are you doing?
-Here. Have a nice last meal.

1486
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,175
Come on, man. Don't do that.

1487
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:39,427
Why don't you supersize it, bitch?

1488
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:42,013
I'm sorry, man. Look, come back.

1489
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,391
I didn't mean that.

1490
01:16:56,821 --> 01:16:59,572
I love you. Do you love me?

1491
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:44,200
That looks great.

1492
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:53,293
Hello?

1493
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:55,670
Dale?

1494
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:57,213
It is Dale

1495
01:17:57,381 --> 01:18:02,260
Angie, I'm calling because I love you
more than anything in the world...

1496
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:05,847
...and I wanna let you know
I'll do anything to make it work.

1497
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:07,765
I'll do anything

1498
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:11,519
I've had a near-death experience,
and when that happens...

1499
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:14,397
...you can prioritize your life,
and you are it, okay?

1500
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:16,733
So please
just take me back, please

1501
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:18,985
-I love you.
-I love you.

1502
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:23,323
-Yeah?
-I just don't wanna lose you, Dale

1503
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:26,951
We were driving away from the house
and I just kept thinking--

1504
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:28,328
I don't know. I just--

1505
01:18:28,496 --> 01:18:29,913
I wanna marry you.

1506
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,667
I made a mistake.

1507
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:37,170
-What do you mean?
-I've....

1508
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:40,006
-What?
-I'm just processing that last bit

1509
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:42,759
-You wanna-- Oh, fuck
-What?

1510
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:44,511
I don't know.

1511
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:46,804
I realize now
that if you would take me back...

1512
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:48,890
...then you are very naive
and immature.

1513
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:52,644
You don't see what a fuck-up I am.
I'm in no shape to be dated by anyone.

1514
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:55,939
-You're the one that's immature.
-I'm not immature. You're immature

1515
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:59,317
I am somewhat immature,
but you're more immature. I'm older

1516
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:00,777
Just because you're older.

1517
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:03,488
I lost my virginity
when I was 14 years old.

1518
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:05,823
-Really?
-How many girls have you slept with?

1519
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:08,076
-Like, two and a half.
-Two and a half?

1520
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:09,452
What is a half? Your hand?

1521
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:12,539
No, it was the tip or I dipped a ball in
I can't remember why.

1522
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:15,375
I remember thinking,
"This doesn't count as a full point."

1523
01:19:15,543 --> 01:19:17,919
If I said three, I'd feel like a liar
I was drunk.

1524
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:19,420
Screw you

1525
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:20,755
Get me out of this room.

1526
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:24,008
I will, and that's the last
you'll ever hear from me, okay?

1527
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:29,973
Oh, thank goodness. Okay.

1528
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,478
Belogus. Faye Belogus.

1529
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:38,231
Lookit there. Lookit there.

1530
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:40,233
Do you use the pool over here?

1531
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:43,152
Yes, I use the pool. Come on,
what do you want from me?

1532
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,531
Your grandson. We need you to get
on the phone with your grandson--

1533
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:48,616
What are you talking about,
my grandson?

1534
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:51,536
You told me you wanna sit down,
play dominos with me.

1535
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:53,705
And now you're hocking me
about my grandson.

1536
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:56,541
-Is that Yiddish?
-Yes. Yes, it is.

1537
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:57,834
May I call you Faye?

1538
01:19:58,002 --> 01:20:01,129
You can call me Faye,
but I'm gonna call you a stinker.

1539
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:02,839
Hey, Mrs. Mendelson.

1540
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:04,549
What do you want from me?

1541
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:06,092
Bubbe. Hey, guys.

1542
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,761
-Well, look who it is.
-Hello, baby.

1543
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:13,891
Damn.

1544
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:16,144
Oh, shit.

1545
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:17,937
Sorry, Betty.

1546
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:24,694
They kidnapped my grandson.

1547
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:26,779
Yeah, these two guys came in...

1548
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:29,949
...they sat down with me
to play dominos.

1549
01:20:30,117 --> 01:20:32,201
I never saw them in my life before.

1550
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:35,538
And they kept asking questions
about my grandson.

1551
01:20:35,706 --> 01:20:40,168
-What did they look like?
-One of them was very tall and sloppy.

1552
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:44,130
And the other guy,
he was very good-looking...

1553
01:20:44,298 --> 01:20:45,632
...but he was short as shit.

1554
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:47,717
But the worst part was...

1555
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:52,263
...that my grandson came in,
why, and in pajamas.

1556
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:54,432
-You gotta find my grandson.
-Do the best--

1557
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,850
-Do you promise?
-I promise.

1558
01:20:56,018 --> 01:20:57,894
Absolutely.
You've got something there.

1559
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,604
I believe that's a mole, ma'am.

1560
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:08,488
You sack of shit. Do you know
what a pain in the ass you've been?

1561
01:21:08,656 --> 01:21:10,406
No, man. I don't wanna get out.

1562
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:13,409
Who gave you that lollipop?
Let's go.

1563
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:15,787
Where am I, man? What?

1564
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:19,415
You guys started it, man.
I don't even wanna be here.

1565
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:20,917
Shit. Did I do that?

1566
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:25,588
Hey, hey. All right, okay.

1567
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,091
Fuck you, man!

1568
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:30,968
-Stand back. Ted wants him alive.
-Why you holding me back?

1569
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,470
Ted wants him alive, okay?

1570
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:34,639
I should be kicking
his fucking teeth in.

1571
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:38,184
-If anybody's gonna beat him, it's Ted.
-I look like Hamburglar.

1572
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:39,394
And the Elephant Man.

1573
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,771
Like someone fucked you up
with a coffee pot.

1574
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:43,690
Professional. Professional.

1575
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:45,983
-Professional on this, bitch.
-Whatever, man.

1576
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:48,277
-Where were you?
-I was there.

1577
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:50,321
-Supposed to be my partner.
-I was there.

1578
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:52,156
No, you wasn't.
How did this happen?

1579
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:54,534
I take the hit?
That's how it's gonna be?

1580
01:21:54,702 --> 01:21:57,078
Fuck all this, you know?
Get him out of here.

1581
01:21:57,246 --> 01:22:00,498
Take him downstairs.
Get this asshole out of my sight.

1582
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:02,834
I don't wanna go near this guy.

1583
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:05,962
What's down there?
Fucking rancor?

1584
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,755
I might act tough...

1585
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:10,007
...but I got a lot of feelings.

1586
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:13,302
And you hurt damn near
every one of them.

1587
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:16,055
This ain't over.

1588
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:18,391
-You know you gonna die, right?
-Yeah.

1589
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:20,601
I'm gonna kill the fuck out of you.

1590
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:24,063
I hope you enjoy these last
17 minutes of your life...

1591
01:22:24,231 --> 01:22:26,482
...because when Ted gets here,
he's gonna be like:

1592
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:29,736
"Kill that motherfucker."
I'm gonna kill your motherfucking ass.

1593
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:30,903
Watch your head.

1594
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:34,657
Hey, watch him.

1595
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:37,744
Oh, my God.

1596
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:40,246
El Dorado.

1597
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:42,790
The legends are true.

1598
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:45,585
Look at all this weed, man.

1599
01:22:45,753 --> 01:22:47,503
What's that? Purple Granddaddy?

1600
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:50,047
-Come on.
-Purple Nurple?

1601
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:52,008
OG Kush?

1602
01:22:52,176 --> 01:22:53,509
OG Kush.

1603
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:03,311
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1604
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,146
-What kind of irrigation--?
-Shut up.

1605
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:07,231
-Can I touch it?
-Come here.

1606
01:23:22,623 --> 01:23:24,415
Hello?

1607
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:25,958
Red?

1608
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:34,050
-Red?
-What the fuck?

1609
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:37,011
Get out of here, man.
I didn't do shit, Denton.

1610
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:40,306
Look, I come in peace, okay?
I'm not here to fight you again.

1611
01:23:40,474 --> 01:23:41,891
Good.

1612
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:44,811
Because I'm tired, man.
Not feeling so hot.

1613
01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:46,813
You don't look great.

1614
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:48,523
They shot me, Denton.

1615
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:49,982
They got me right here.

1616
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:51,484
-Yeah?
-Right here.

1617
01:23:51,652 --> 01:23:53,486
And then they got me again
right here.

1618
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:56,864
Look, man, I'll call 911 right now.

1619
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,574
They'll save your life, okay?

1620
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:00,660
-You don't need to die.
-No, bro.

1621
01:24:00,828 --> 01:24:03,454
You don't get it.
It doesn't really matter where I'm at.

1622
01:24:03,622 --> 01:24:05,873
If I'm at the hospital, if I'm here...

1623
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,167
...Ted's gonna find me, man.
He will.

1624
01:24:08,335 --> 01:24:11,254
And when he does,
he's gonna fucking kill me.

1625
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:13,047
He's just, like, an asshole.

1626
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:16,175
I couldn't agree more, Red.
That's why I've come here, okay?

1627
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:18,177
You know Ted? He took Saul.

1628
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:19,720
And I'm gonna get him back.

1629
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:21,889
You know, like, he saved my life.

1630
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:25,184
We've been on the run together.
He's a great friend. A good guy.

1631
01:24:25,352 --> 01:24:28,187
He is. I'll tell you that, man.
Saul is a good dude.

1632
01:24:28,355 --> 01:24:29,438
I was mean to him, man.

1633
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:32,358
I wronged him and I can't--
I can't let it end like that.

1634
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:36,195
I'm just into Buddhism
and I'm at peace with the fact...

1635
01:24:36,363 --> 01:24:40,241
...that me as this person,
probably gonna not be around.

1636
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:42,368
Think about a hermit crab, okay?

1637
01:24:42,536 --> 01:24:46,497
And it's a shell, and it's like
they go from one shell to the next.

1638
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:50,793
And that's what I am. It's like
I'm just a hermit crab changing shells.

1639
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:53,337
Except, if you're a dick
your whole life...

1640
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:56,382
...your next shell
will be made of shit, okay?

1641
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:59,302
If you're an asshole, you're gonna
come back as a cockroach.

1642
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:03,222
Or a worm,
or a fucking anal bead, okay?

1643
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:05,766
If you're a man,
and you act heroic...

1644
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:07,518
...you'll come back as an eagle.

1645
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:09,228
You'll come back as a dragon.

1646
01:25:09,396 --> 01:25:11,063
You'll come back as Jude Law.

1647
01:25:11,899 --> 01:25:14,066
Okay? Which would you rather be?

1648
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:17,570
Maybe the anal bead. Might--
Depending on who it belongs to.

1649
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:18,779
It belongs to me.

1650
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:20,406
-Then the dragon.
-Exactly.

1651
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:24,410
You need to help me, okay?
Just use it, you know? Use the pain.

1652
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:25,786
You'll have a second wind.

1653
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:28,372
Let's get up
and go get Saul back. Use it.

1654
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:31,208
-Aren't you angry at Ted?
-Yeah, I'm really mad at him.

1655
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:34,545
What do you wanna do? Don't you
wanna get up, do something about it?

1656
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:37,006
Maybe that would be cool
to do to him.

1657
01:25:37,174 --> 01:25:38,841
I don't think "maybe" is the answer.

1658
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:41,302
I think, "Yes, I'm gonna
help you, Dale"...

1659
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:43,262
...that's the answer I'm looking for.

1660
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,265
Come here.

1661
01:25:49,436 --> 01:25:53,147
Ted Jones messed
with the wrong melon farmers.

1662
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:57,693
Thug life.

1663
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:04,909
Oh, shit.

1664
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:07,787
Get those. I don't wanna
run them over in the vacuum...

1665
01:26:07,955 --> 01:26:10,039
-...and shoot my face off, okay?
-I'm sorry.

1666
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:19,715
I used to use this little gun
when I was a prostitute.

1667
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:26,639
Don't.

1668
01:26:26,807 --> 01:26:27,807
Don't.

1669
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:29,642
Just something quick like that.

1670
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:31,310
-Don't.
-Yeah.

1671
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:33,646
-Don't. You stop it right now.
-Stop it.

1672
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:48,744
Oh, God.

1673
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:53,499
That's a big hideout.

1674
01:26:55,419 --> 01:26:57,461
I can't do this. I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

1675
01:26:57,629 --> 01:27:00,589
I'm infected. My shit's all fucked up.
I need medical attention.

1676
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:03,676
What? I thought we just got all
pumped up. What was that about?

1677
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:06,262
Ted is a fucking murderer.
I can't fuck with him.

1678
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,514
I got a wife.
She's gonna be out of jail soon.

1679
01:27:08,682 --> 01:27:11,600
I wanna fuck her. I am not gonna
wake up murdered tomorrow.

1680
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:13,936
Oh, man, no.
This is lame of you, man.

1681
01:27:14,104 --> 01:27:16,480
Come on. This could be
your moment of redemption.

1682
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:17,857
This could be your moment.

1683
01:27:18,025 --> 01:27:20,568
I don't want a moment.
I don't want-- Fine, go.

1684
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:21,777
Fuck you.

1685
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:24,113
Please come back for me.
Please come back.

1686
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:28,492
Legends never die, dude.
I'll tell your story.

1687
01:27:29,202 --> 01:27:32,038
Carol, she's cool now.

1688
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:36,167
Carol used to be a little crazy, man.
She used to throw tickle parties.

1689
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:38,627
-Sounds like home-cooking to me.
-That was fun.

1690
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:41,213
Game over, motherfuckers!
Everybody freeze!

1691
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:43,674
Tell me where my friend is
or this guy gets it!

1692
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:46,052
All right, everybody be cool, man.
Be cool.

1693
01:27:46,219 --> 01:27:47,762
Put your guns down.
Nobody shoots.

1694
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:49,555
Put them down. On the ground.

1695
01:27:49,723 --> 01:27:52,058
All right, everybody just chill.

1696
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:54,143
Oh, my God!

1697
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:55,978
-You shot him.
-Put the gun down.

1698
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:58,689
-Drop the fucking gun.
-Don't shoot me!

1699
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:01,150
-Holy shit.
-I said, nobody shoot. You shot Pete.

1700
01:28:01,318 --> 01:28:03,110
That's right. I shot him. I shot him.

1701
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:06,030
I shot him. I don't have time
for a fucking negotiation.

1702
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:08,699
Now, I wanna finish this off
so I can go home...

1703
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:10,785
...and have dinner
with my wife for once.

1704
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:13,079
If anybody asks, Denton killed Pete.

1705
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:15,081
End of story.

1706
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:17,249
I'm telling Ted.

1707
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:19,210
-If you do--
-He's got a piece.

1708
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:20,961
-Motherfucker.
-Okay, I'm sorry.

1709
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,797
He's got another one, in the side.

1710
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:24,590
Damn it. I got one more on my leg.

1711
01:28:24,758 --> 01:28:27,009
There's one more.
I know you'll find it. Take it.

1712
01:28:27,177 --> 01:28:29,345
I'm sorry, guys.
Sorry I deceived you.

1713
01:28:29,513 --> 01:28:30,763
No. Come on.

1714
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:36,268
-Oh, great.
-Saul.

1715
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:37,561
-Dale.
-Yes.

1716
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:40,898
What did you do, rat me out?
Is that what you did, you bastard?

1717
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:42,942
-No, man.
-Yes.

1718
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:44,777
I'm here to save you.

1719
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:47,613
No. You just got caught too.

1720
01:28:47,781 --> 01:28:50,157
And I'm gonna die in here
with some asshole.

1721
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:52,409
Okay, you know what?
I deserved that.

1722
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:55,412
I'll take that because
I have been an asshole, man.

1723
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:58,749
This whole thing is my fault.
I ruined your life.

1724
01:28:59,126 --> 01:29:02,128
Okay? And I know there's no way...

1725
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:04,713
...to make that up to you
except by saving your life.

1726
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:07,967
So that's what I came here to do.
I'm here to save my best friend.

1727
01:29:08,135 --> 01:29:10,636
Because that's what you are.
You're my best friend.

1728
01:29:10,804 --> 01:29:12,555
You're a mean jerk.

1729
01:29:12,722 --> 01:29:15,683
I was mean.
I was mean because, I think--

1730
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:18,102
I didn't want
you to be my best friend.

1731
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:20,980
I didn't wanna think
that that's what my life was.

1732
01:29:21,148 --> 01:29:23,607
Now I realize I'm lucky
to have you as my best friend.

1733
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:25,276
You're the best guy I know.

1734
01:29:25,986 --> 01:29:27,278
BFFF.

1735
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:29,864
Best fucking friends forever, man.
Seriously.

1736
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:35,411
-All right. Give me a hug.
-Yeah. Okay.

1737
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:37,997
Thanks, man.
I'm so sorry about everything.

1738
01:29:38,165 --> 01:29:39,498
Oh, I'm such a dick.

1739
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:42,835
-Okay. I'm gonna get us out.
-No, you're not, but it's okay.

1740
01:29:43,003 --> 01:29:45,880
These guys are gonna fucking kill us.
We gotta get out of here.

1741
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:47,798
-I know. They are.
-Fuck, man.

1742
01:29:47,966 --> 01:29:52,303
We can hear you outside and
it's very fucking annoying, all right?

1743
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:55,014
-Okay. Sorry about that, sir.
-Shut the fuck up.

1744
01:29:55,182 --> 01:29:57,349
Do you know
what "shut the fuck up" mean?

1745
01:29:57,517 --> 01:29:59,018
I do.

1746
01:29:59,186 --> 01:30:00,978
Shit. Stupid motherfuckers.

1747
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:05,065
Yes. Okay. I got an idea. I got an idea.
My belt buckle. My belt buckle.

1748
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:08,694
Right here. Okay? Rub your wrists
against my belt buckle. That'll do it.

1749
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:11,697
-Is it working?
-I can't feel it.

1750
01:30:11,865 --> 01:30:12,865
I can't feel you.

1751
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:14,992
-Wait, I feel it.
-I feel it. Yes, okay.

1752
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,535
-Okay.
-Okay. Okay.

1753
01:30:16,703 --> 01:30:18,829
-I'm gonna save you, man.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1754
01:30:18,997 --> 01:30:20,748
-Let me save you.
-Save me, Dale.

1755
01:30:20,916 --> 01:30:22,791
It's not working.
We gotta change angles.

1756
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:25,211
We gotta
get more leverage-y. Okay.

1757
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:26,879
Okay, that's good. That's good.

1758
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:28,964
Get your hands up on it.
There we go.

1759
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:31,217
-All right. All right.
-Yeah. Okay.

1760
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:34,470
-Yes. Yes.
-Okay.

1761
01:30:34,638 --> 01:30:37,056
I'm gonna save you, man.
I'm gonna save you.

1762
01:30:37,224 --> 01:30:39,516
-You're my best friend, man.
-Yeah, see?

1763
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:42,770
-It's not working.
-Let me use my-- I'll use my mouth.

1764
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:44,897
Finish it off with my mouth, pal.
Let's go.

1765
01:30:45,065 --> 01:30:47,191
Come on. Let's go.

1766
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:49,235
Harder.

1767
01:30:57,827 --> 01:31:00,246
-Where are these fuckers?
-We got them downstairs.

1768
01:31:00,413 --> 01:31:03,082
-Where did you find them?
-Found Saul at his grandmother's.

1769
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:06,168
He fucked up Matheson's face.
Hit him with a pot of hot coffee.

1770
01:31:06,336 --> 01:31:07,753
It's gross.

1771
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:10,214
Dale Denton comes flying in here
like a madman...

1772
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:14,176
...armed to the teeth, and,
as you can see, he shot Peter.

1773
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:16,553
Plugged him, just whacked him.

1774
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:19,932
Now they're both disarmed
and they're downstairs.

1775
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,684
He shot Pete?

1776
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:23,852
Fucking Pete? He was ex-CIA.

1777
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:26,563
Who the fuck is this Dale Denton?

1778
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:30,025
Who is he? Where did he come from?
I do not know.

1779
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:36,615
Time to cook shit up tonight.

1780
01:31:36,783 --> 01:31:38,826
Take his stash and burn
this motherfucker down.

1781
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:42,121
Stop. Wait here.

1782
01:31:42,289 --> 01:31:45,040
No retreat, no surrender.

1783
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:51,547
Yes, yes, yes.

1784
01:31:51,715 --> 01:31:54,550
-Wait, someone's coming.
-Okay, okay, okay.

1785
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:58,137
If I cough once, I'll take the lead.
If I cough twice, you go, okay?

1786
01:31:58,305 --> 01:32:00,472
Well-- I cough sometimes for real.

1787
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,558
Just don't. Don't--

1788
01:32:08,148 --> 01:32:11,233
Yo, look. I'm gonna say this
one time.

1789
01:32:11,401 --> 01:32:15,487
Whatever you're doing,
I get it, okay?

1790
01:32:15,655 --> 01:32:17,156
Stop.

1791
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:23,120
See, I don't think
you understood me.

1792
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:25,122
I can hear everything you're saying.

1793
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:28,000
One cough mean you go.
Two cough mean you take the lead.

1794
01:32:28,168 --> 01:32:30,669
The belt buckle.
Best friends forever.

1795
01:32:30,837 --> 01:32:33,088
Y'all fuck on your own time, man.

1796
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:34,840
Sorry, man. It was a stupid plan.

1797
01:32:35,008 --> 01:32:37,426
What the fuck is that?

1798
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:40,763
Dale!

1799
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:48,312
I've been waiting for this.
You burned my face!

1800
01:32:50,607 --> 01:32:52,941
I'm gonna tear this ass up.

1801
01:32:59,449 --> 01:33:00,949
You shot me.

1802
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:02,493
I'm sorry, man.

1803
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:06,372
I've never been shot.
Damn, that hurt.

1804
01:33:06,539 --> 01:33:08,165
I got glass in my ass.

1805
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:10,918
-Dale. Dale!
-This is messed up.

1806
01:33:11,086 --> 01:33:13,212
Has anyone seen my bigger knife?

1807
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:17,591
Asians!

1808
01:33:22,555 --> 01:33:23,555
War is upon you!

1809
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:25,557
Prepare to suck the cock of karma!

1810
01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:32,815
Get down, motherfucker!

1811
01:33:37,362 --> 01:33:38,570
Come on!

1812
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:42,533
Fuck!

1813
01:33:51,918 --> 01:33:53,252
Go! Go!

1814
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:54,586
Get down, baby!

1815
01:33:54,754 --> 01:33:56,505
Dale, no!

1816
01:33:56,673 --> 01:33:58,298
No, wake up, man.

1817
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:00,342
No, you're not dying, man.

1818
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:03,095
Not without me.

1819
01:34:03,263 --> 01:34:04,596
-Dale.
-What?

1820
01:34:04,764 --> 01:34:06,598
You're alive.

1821
01:34:06,766 --> 01:34:10,269
-You're-- You're alive.
-What happened?

1822
01:34:10,854 --> 01:34:12,938
-He got your ear, man.
-He got my what?

1823
01:34:13,106 --> 01:34:15,816
-He got your ear.
-Fuck!

1824
01:34:16,943 --> 01:34:18,610
Fuck!

1825
01:34:20,864 --> 01:34:22,364
-Help!
-My ear.

1826
01:34:22,532 --> 01:34:23,574
-Yeah.
-Help!

1827
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:25,826
-You killed my ear.
-You shot me.

1828
01:34:25,994 --> 01:34:27,911
-I didn't do that.
-He shot me.

1829
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:29,121
You shot him?

1830
01:34:29,289 --> 01:34:31,498
-Get your hands off of me.
-Shut up.

1831
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:33,292
We've had enough out of you.

1832
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:34,710
I'm not your friend.

1833
01:34:34,878 --> 01:34:36,253
Maybe I can just--

1834
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:38,422
No. No, infected.

1835
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:40,966
Is that it? Maybe if we just hold it.

1836
01:35:15,502 --> 01:35:17,169
It's clear.

1837
01:35:18,087 --> 01:35:20,422
Dude. Look.

1838
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:22,174
Nice.

1839
01:35:34,521 --> 01:35:36,021
Bullets.

1840
01:35:44,197 --> 01:35:47,032
So seriously,
how gross does my ear look?

1841
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:50,536
Is it really disgusting
or is it, like, kind of cool in a way?

1842
01:35:50,703 --> 01:35:52,746
Right now it's pretty disgusting.

1843
01:35:52,914 --> 01:35:54,873
I feel like I can smell it.

1844
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:57,543
Don't worry, bro.
Think about Evander Holyfield.

1845
01:35:57,710 --> 01:35:58,752
You can't even tell.

1846
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,045
That's a good point.

1847
01:36:00,213 --> 01:36:01,588
Wait.

1848
01:36:44,299 --> 01:36:45,674
Did you shoot that guy?

1849
01:36:45,842 --> 01:36:47,426
No. I'm out of bullets.

1850
01:36:47,594 --> 01:36:49,136
Me too.

1851
01:36:49,304 --> 01:36:51,597
Maybe it was ricochet.

1852
01:36:51,764 --> 01:36:53,765
Gravity.

1853
01:36:53,933 --> 01:36:55,642
Oh, nice.

1854
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:57,769
You go down.

1855
01:36:57,937 --> 01:36:59,104
I'll cover.

1856
01:36:59,272 --> 01:37:02,441
Watch my back.
I'll go down and take care of this.

1857
01:37:06,946 --> 01:37:08,780
Sexy motherfucker.

1858
01:37:27,425 --> 01:37:29,801
No, no, there might be
more bad guys up there.

1859
01:37:29,969 --> 01:37:32,262
No, we'll sneak out through
the vent. Come on.

1860
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:35,641
I'll boost you up, okay?
And then you pull me up.

1861
01:37:37,393 --> 01:37:39,186
Oh, nice.

1862
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:42,314
Here we go. Okay.

1863
01:37:42,482 --> 01:37:45,400
Get up. Yeah. Nice.

1864
01:37:48,321 --> 01:37:49,321
Nice.

1865
01:37:49,989 --> 01:37:51,823
Nice. Okay.

1866
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:53,241
Pull me up.

1867
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:55,202
I'm ready. Go.

1868
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:57,162
-Give it to me.
-Come on.

1869
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:59,790
-Be taller.
-Be stronger.

1870
01:37:59,957 --> 01:38:01,958
-Pull harder.
-Dale, come on.

1871
01:38:02,126 --> 01:38:04,836
Pull. Pull me. Come on, man.

1872
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:07,839
-I'm jumping as high as I can.
-Denton!

1873
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:11,802
Dale!

1874
01:38:11,969 --> 01:38:13,512
I'll get help. I'll get help.

1875
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:18,517
Go ahead and run, you little dipshit.
I'll find you.

1876
01:39:46,189 --> 01:39:48,023
Give me that fire extinguisher.

1877
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:49,399
Okay.

1878
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:14,049
You and me, baby.
Drop it now! Put the bag down!

1879
01:40:14,217 --> 01:40:15,383
Now!

1880
01:40:30,316 --> 01:40:31,441
Fuck you!

1881
01:40:36,572 --> 01:40:39,491
Fuck the police!

1882
01:41:00,012 --> 01:41:02,347
Motherfucking kill you!

1883
01:41:04,767 --> 01:41:07,310
-Why you doing this to me?
-Why you doing this to me?

1884
01:41:08,396 --> 01:41:09,896
Oh, shit!

1885
01:41:10,064 --> 01:41:11,273
Come here!

1886
01:41:18,614 --> 01:41:20,532
I hate you!

1887
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:22,993
No! Ted, stop it!

1888
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:32,836
Come on, bitch.
Come on, I'll twist your balls so tight.

1889
01:41:33,004 --> 01:41:34,963
You're in the jungle now, baby.

1890
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,014
Jesus!

1891
01:41:51,397 --> 01:41:52,939
Fuck.

1892
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:03,742
Gonna die.

1893
01:42:06,412 --> 01:42:08,747
-You killed--
-I didn't wanna do that.

1894
01:42:09,832 --> 01:42:11,750
But you weren't gonna stop.

1895
01:42:18,299 --> 01:42:19,883
Shoot him!

1896
01:42:20,051 --> 01:42:22,385
Just take it easy, buddy.

1897
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:26,514
Shoot him, you dumb fuck!

1898
01:42:29,644 --> 01:42:31,436
I'm hungry.

1899
01:42:31,604 --> 01:42:33,521
I'm going home.

1900
01:42:37,443 --> 01:42:39,110
All right.

1901
01:42:40,696 --> 01:42:42,364
Help.

1902
01:42:45,117 --> 01:42:46,868
I knew you were going soft.

1903
01:42:47,036 --> 01:42:50,121
Dinner's gonna be cold tonight,
asshole.

1904
01:42:50,289 --> 01:42:52,374
Fucked up, man.

1905
01:42:54,585 --> 01:42:58,129
-Well, lookie here. Mr. Folgers.
-Oh, man.

1906
01:42:58,297 --> 01:42:59,756
What's up, sir?

1907
01:43:00,383 --> 01:43:04,177
-Look, I didn't wanna hit you, man--
-Shut the fuck up.

1908
01:43:04,345 --> 01:43:08,848
You think you was gonna
get me, motherfucker, huh?

1909
01:43:09,016 --> 01:43:11,643
You need to sit
your little sexy ass down...

1910
01:43:11,811 --> 01:43:13,937
...and watch yourself get killed now.

1911
01:43:14,105 --> 01:43:15,522
All right.

1912
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:17,774
You know what?
This is how it's gonna be?

1913
01:43:17,942 --> 01:43:21,528
All right. This is how it ends.

1914
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:41,798
You just got killed by a
Daewoo Lanos, motherfucker.

1915
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:43,466
How you like me now, huh?

1916
01:43:44,802 --> 01:43:45,969
Gross.

1917
01:43:46,137 --> 01:43:47,178
Red?

1918
01:43:47,638 --> 01:43:48,805
Saul.

1919
01:43:48,973 --> 01:43:51,850
Hey, Saul. I came back for you, bro.

1920
01:43:52,018 --> 01:43:53,685
-Yeah.
-I remembered, man.

1921
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,021
Bro's before ho's.

1922
01:43:56,731 --> 01:43:59,691
-You lied to me.
-I did. I lied bigtime to you.

1923
01:43:59,859 --> 01:44:04,320
Dale said that you didn't even
have herpes and I said that you did.

1924
01:44:04,488 --> 01:44:08,074
Honestly, like, from now on, from
everything that we've gone through...

1925
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:12,037
...and, like, from seeing this asshole's
nuts smashed with my Daewoo...

1926
01:44:12,204 --> 01:44:15,206
...I wanna be a better friend to you,
like I really am.

1927
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,877
I fucking love you, dog.
Fucking love you.

1928
01:44:19,503 --> 01:44:21,588
I wanna be inside you, homes.

1929
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,591
No more lies, Red.

1930
01:44:24,759 --> 01:44:27,302
-This is my moment.
-This is your moment.

1931
01:44:29,889 --> 01:44:31,389
Red!

1932
01:44:49,075 --> 01:44:51,993
You know what? I'm feeling it.

1933
01:44:52,161 --> 01:44:54,037
Red, I'm coming, baby.

1934
01:44:54,205 --> 01:44:56,623
Your stupidity amazes me.

1935
01:44:59,043 --> 01:45:00,794
Hey, Ted!

1936
01:45:00,961 --> 01:45:02,921
You killed my brother...

1937
01:45:03,089 --> 01:45:06,216
...Caucasian son of cocksucker!

1938
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:09,427
Suck my balls! Two times!

1939
01:45:17,269 --> 01:45:18,353
Bitch!

1940
01:45:18,521 --> 01:45:20,063
Bring it on.

1941
01:45:31,659 --> 01:45:32,700
Shit. Dale.

1942
01:45:34,245 --> 01:45:36,454
Dale!

1943
01:45:36,622 --> 01:45:38,289
Holy shit!

1944
01:46:14,785 --> 01:46:15,827
Sorry, Ted.

1945
01:46:19,999 --> 01:46:21,958
You've been served.

1946
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:31,843
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1947
01:46:32,011 --> 01:46:34,554
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1948
01:46:38,851 --> 01:46:40,476
Saul! Saul!

1949
01:46:46,025 --> 01:46:48,985
Wake up, man! This place
is gonna collapse! Come on!

1950
01:46:49,153 --> 01:46:50,987
Come to me!

1951
01:46:53,032 --> 01:46:54,866
You're not dying today, friend.

1952
01:46:55,034 --> 01:46:57,911
Not on my watch.

1953
01:47:24,897 --> 01:47:28,107
Saul. Wake up, man, please.

1954
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:29,734
Saul.

1955
01:47:29,902 --> 01:47:31,402
Wake up.

1956
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:33,988
Oh, sweet Saul.

1957
01:47:36,492 --> 01:47:39,202
Saul.

1958
01:47:42,039 --> 01:47:43,831
Yes. Yeah.

1959
01:47:43,999 --> 01:47:45,458
Saul, you made it.

1960
01:47:45,626 --> 01:47:48,169
-What?
-Yeah.

1961
01:47:48,337 --> 01:47:50,255
Where am I?

1962
01:47:50,422 --> 01:47:52,465
You made it, man.

1963
01:47:52,633 --> 01:47:55,176
-You saved me.
-You came back for me.

1964
01:47:55,344 --> 01:47:58,388
-Yeah.
-Oh, thank you.

1965
01:47:58,555 --> 01:47:59,889
What happened?

1966
01:48:00,057 --> 01:48:01,266
What happened?

1967
01:48:07,773 --> 01:48:10,191
Holy shit.

1968
01:48:14,113 --> 01:48:15,822
What's that?

1969
01:48:18,617 --> 01:48:20,451
Hi.

1970
01:48:20,619 --> 01:48:22,495
-Red?
-Red?

1971
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:28,126
-Red.
-Hey.

1972
01:48:28,294 --> 01:48:31,629
Red. Where'd you come from, man?
Where'd he come from?

1973
01:48:31,797 --> 01:48:32,880
He came back to save us.

1974
01:48:33,048 --> 01:48:34,132
-He saved us?
-Yeah.

1975
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:35,717
All right, man.

1976
01:48:35,884 --> 01:48:38,011
-We all saved each other.
-Yeah.

1977
01:48:38,178 --> 01:48:41,055
Oh, man. We made it, guys.

1978
01:48:41,223 --> 01:48:44,851
We made it. Oh, we made it.

1979
01:48:50,316 --> 01:48:55,278
Hello, you're listening to PPRPBP
I am Dale Denton.

1980
01:48:55,446 --> 01:48:59,282
The topic of the day: new beginnings
Getting over losses.

1981
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:01,826
Friends. Life

1982
01:49:01,994 --> 01:49:04,620
We have our first caller.

1983
01:49:04,788 --> 01:49:07,415
Yes, ring-ring-ring. How's it going?

1984
01:49:07,583 --> 01:49:09,208
Hi. Am I on the air?

1985
01:49:09,376 --> 01:49:12,420
You are. You're about
to get D'd by the Dale.

1986
01:49:12,588 --> 01:49:13,671
A D in the face.

1987
01:49:13,839 --> 01:49:15,173
-Dale Denton?
-Yeah?

1988
01:49:15,341 --> 01:49:17,300
You're my hero.

1989
01:49:17,468 --> 01:49:20,011
You're my hero.

1990
01:49:20,679 --> 01:49:22,180
You are good, man. Seriously.

1991
01:49:22,348 --> 01:49:24,265
-Thanks.
-Gotta admit, you're pretty good.

1992
01:49:24,433 --> 01:49:26,434
-It sounds pretty good.
-It sounds real.

1993
01:49:26,602 --> 01:49:29,395
-It's not bad, huh?
-If I close my eyes, it sounds like--

1994
01:49:29,563 --> 01:49:32,690
-You are on the radio.
-That's the radio. That's a DJ.

1995
01:49:32,858 --> 01:49:35,693
-If you were on it, I would listen to it.
-Thanks, man.

1996
01:49:35,861 --> 01:49:38,237
It's like when my bubbe
was always playing opera...

1997
01:49:38,405 --> 01:49:40,239
...I hated it, but my bubbe loves it.

1998
01:49:40,407 --> 01:49:43,201
Then it grows on you.
It grows on you. Yeah.

1999
01:49:43,369 --> 01:49:45,995
It's like Red. I didn't like Red
when I first met him.

2000
01:49:46,163 --> 01:49:48,247
-You didn't like me?
-You liked him so much...

2001
01:49:48,415 --> 01:49:50,208
...I like you now.

2002
01:49:50,376 --> 01:49:53,836
I know this sounds weird, but can
we be best friends? Just us, for real?

2003
01:49:54,004 --> 01:49:56,047
-We should all be best friends.
-We should.

2004
01:49:56,215 --> 01:49:59,425
Seriously. You guys are, like,
both of my best friends.

2005
01:49:59,593 --> 01:50:02,387
You didn't know it. Now you know it,
we'll all be best friends.

2006
01:50:02,554 --> 01:50:04,764
Know those hearts that break up,
"best friends"?

2007
01:50:04,932 --> 01:50:06,349
We should get a three-way one.

2008
01:50:06,517 --> 01:50:10,144
-I don't know if they make those.
-We should make the first one.

2009
01:50:10,312 --> 01:50:13,231
I want the middle piece,
so it'll be crooked on both sides.

2010
01:50:13,399 --> 01:50:17,318
I know we've gone over this, but, like,
1000 pardons, 1000 pardons, please.

2011
01:50:17,486 --> 01:50:20,238
-I fucked up--
-I was a dick to you, man. I'm sorry.

2012
01:50:20,406 --> 01:50:22,907
I know I was an asshole.
I hope I redeemed myself.

2013
01:50:23,075 --> 01:50:25,952
-I know me and you had our deal.
-We've had some times.

2014
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:28,996
I feel like something's happening here.
Is that a boner?

2015
01:50:29,164 --> 01:50:31,916
Is that a condo? That us moving
into an apartment together?

2016
01:50:32,084 --> 01:50:33,626
Is that us getting a time-share?

2017
01:50:33,794 --> 01:50:36,212
-You threw an ashtray at his face.
-You hit me, man.

2018
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:38,756
At the time, I was like:
But it was kind of funny.

2019
01:50:38,924 --> 01:50:41,467
You hit me with a DustBuster, man.

2020
01:50:41,635 --> 01:50:44,762
I didn't wanna hurt you.
It was like, "You better not leave here."

2021
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:46,931
-That was such a good fight, man.
-That was.

2022
01:50:47,099 --> 01:50:48,558
You fuckhead.

2023
01:50:48,725 --> 01:50:51,269
-The car chase was awesome.
-You got into a car chase?

2024
01:50:51,437 --> 01:50:54,063
-Are you kidding me? Oh, my God.
-Yeah, it was....

2025
01:50:54,231 --> 01:50:57,150
I, like, had my foot
through the window.

2026
01:50:57,317 --> 01:51:01,362
My groin-- I mean,
I felt like a wishbone.

2027
01:51:03,115 --> 01:51:06,325
-I just feel different about everything.
-Me too, man. Everything.

2028
01:51:06,493 --> 01:51:08,578
Like, I never wanna
kill anybody else again.

2029
01:51:08,745 --> 01:51:10,621
-Ever.
-That's something you pretty much--

2030
01:51:10,789 --> 01:51:12,623
You can just kind of
dip your toes into.

2031
01:51:12,791 --> 01:51:14,667
We kind of dipped our toes
into murder.

2032
01:51:14,835 --> 01:51:17,295
I killed six guys, I think.
How many guys did you--?

2033
01:51:17,463 --> 01:51:19,338
-We each shot several people.
-A lot.

2034
01:51:19,506 --> 01:51:21,507
Some people get a taste for it,
but I don't.

2035
01:51:21,675 --> 01:51:24,802
I shot someone who was already dead
so that doesn't count as a murder.

2036
01:51:24,970 --> 01:51:27,138
Apparently you hit him
with your car, I'm told.

2037
01:51:27,306 --> 01:51:29,849
-That-- You killed him.
-Okay, so I did murder somebody.

2038
01:51:30,017 --> 01:51:32,351
-You murdered, man.
-Not a big deal. That's cool.

2039
01:51:32,519 --> 01:51:35,104
-That's cool. Whatever. Kill or be killed.
-I know.

2040
01:51:35,272 --> 01:51:37,064
I'm trying to decide
how stoned I am...

2041
01:51:37,232 --> 01:51:39,442
...and just how on the verge
of death am I now.

2042
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:43,070
Am I seeing shit because I'm stoned
or because I have no blood left?

2043
01:51:43,238 --> 01:51:46,073
-You've been shot, like, seven times.
-You gotta eat.

2044
01:51:46,241 --> 01:51:47,992
-You're losing stuff.
-Yeah.

2045
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:50,036
-Here.
-Yeah, okay.

2046
01:51:50,204 --> 01:51:53,664
-Here comes the airplane.
-Look, like a baby.

2047
01:51:55,876 --> 01:51:58,336
It's a miracle.
I think we should all take a moment...

2048
01:51:58,504 --> 01:52:01,088
...and think about what a miracle
it is that we got out.

2049
01:52:01,256 --> 01:52:03,257
And that we became friends
in the process...

2050
01:52:03,425 --> 01:52:05,676
...and learned some shit about life
and stuff.

2051
01:52:05,844 --> 01:52:10,056
Should we touch each other's hands
while we do it? Okay.

2052
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:13,517
I love you guys.

2053
01:52:13,685 --> 01:52:16,062
I love you dudes so much.

2054
01:52:18,982 --> 01:52:21,651
I'll remember that
for the rest of my life.

2055
01:52:22,527 --> 01:52:23,986
-Red?
-Red?

2056
01:52:24,154 --> 01:52:26,155
Yo, Red, man. You alive?

2057
01:52:26,323 --> 01:52:27,657
What's up, pal?

2058
01:52:28,575 --> 01:52:30,076
-Hey.
-Hey.

2059
01:52:30,244 --> 01:52:33,955
I'm like the nerd at the sleepover
who fell asleep at 9.

2060
01:52:34,122 --> 01:52:36,374
That's okay. We won't put
our dicks in your mouth.

2061
01:52:36,541 --> 01:52:40,002
-Oh, God.
-Hey, there's bubbe.

2062
01:52:40,170 --> 01:52:42,296
Come on. Let's get out of here.

2063
01:52:42,464 --> 01:52:44,382
Yeah, maybe
we should go to the doctor.

2064
01:52:44,549 --> 01:52:46,676
Do you think she'll drive me
to the hospital?

2065
01:52:46,843 --> 01:52:48,761
Me too. I should
get the ear looked at.

2066
01:52:48,929 --> 01:52:51,180
My ear should probably
get professional attention.

2067
01:52:51,348 --> 01:52:53,432
-It is bad.
-That's a bullet burp.

2068
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:56,644
Either I'm getting ready to die
or I'm gonna take a massive shit.

2069
01:52:56,812 --> 01:52:58,688
If somebody could get me
to the hospital.

2070
01:52:58,855 --> 01:53:00,439
Blood from my ear just....

2071
01:53:00,607 --> 01:53:03,401
You guys smell like shit.

2072
01:53:04,611 --> 01:53:07,280
You are in serious danger.
