<i> 1937   美利堅合眾國 </ i></i>

2
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,109
- When did it start? - At 0500. We're seven minutes in.

3
00:01:27,926 --> 00:01:28,950
OK...Private Miller...

4
00:01:29,127 --> 00:01:32,153
...you've been smoking ltem 9 for seven minutes and 13 seconds.

5
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,264
We're going to ask you several questions.

6
00:01:34,432 --> 00:01:35,456
How do you feel?

7
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:37,867
Well, sir...

8
00:01:38,036 --> 00:01:39,765
...I feel like a...

9
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:43,004
Like a slice of butter...

10
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:49,578
...melting on top of a big old pile of flapjacks.

11
00:01:52,183 --> 00:01:53,207
Yeah.

12
00:01:53,651 --> 00:01:56,745
Okay, Private Miller, when you think of your superiors...

13
00:01:57,355 --> 00:01:59,789
...what emotions do you feel?

14
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:08,460
Okay, Private Miller?

15
00:02:12,103 --> 00:02:13,127
Is this normal?

16
00:02:13,304 --> 00:02:14,965
Okay, Private...

17
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,905
Okay, Private Miller?

18
00:02:18,076 --> 00:02:19,668
Private Miller.

19
00:02:23,147 --> 00:02:24,705
Answer the question.

20
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:32,015
This went out, sir.

21
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,852
Can you torch me?

22
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:36,618
We'll send someone in.

23
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,956
Holy bejesus!

24
00:02:45,603 --> 00:02:48,504
Private Miller, answer the question.

25
00:02:48,673 --> 00:02:50,231
What was the question again, sir?

26
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:54,839
When you think of your superiors, what emotions do you feel?

27
00:02:55,179 --> 00:02:56,771
You know what problem I have...

28
00:02:56,948 --> 00:03:00,281
...with your fucking little dog-and-pony act you call the military?

29
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:03,818
Here it is. One: lots of dudes.

30
00:03:03,988 --> 00:03:05,421
Where are the boobies?

31
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,026
Two: Why are we underground right now, sir?

32
00:03:09,193 --> 00:03:12,390
Why can't we be out in the open? Why aren't we in a square right now?

33
00:03:12,564 --> 00:03:15,863
Why aren't we talking to people, letting them know ltem 9 exists?

34
00:03:16,034 --> 00:03:18,594
Get it out. Shout off the rooftops:

35
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,264
"This is great! This is the bee's knees, ltem 9!"

36
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:25,102
Private, we need you to be serious.

37
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:29,007
I'm serious. Your dick, my mouth.

38
00:03:33,117 --> 00:03:34,846
That's inappropriate.

39
00:03:43,127 --> 00:03:44,151
Fuck you!

40
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:47,992
I've seen enough. Shut it down.

41
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:51,761
Bury the hatch. Sell the land. And dispose of him.

42
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,233
This never happened.

43
00:03:53,404 --> 00:03:55,031
Dude, what happened to your eye?

44
00:03:55,673 --> 00:03:57,265
Hello.

45
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:59,606
Can you guys understand me?

46
00:03:59,777 --> 00:04:02,644
- Hey. Hey, where we going? - This is General Brat.

47
00:04:02,814 --> 00:04:05,578
We've reached a final conclusion on ltem 9.

48
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:07,847
Illegal!

49
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:09,043
<i>Hey, this is Sam. Good morning.</i>

50
00:04:09,654 --> 00:04:10,814
<i>Welcome to KRAD.</i>

51
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:13,924
<i>You know, I think that last caller</i> <i>had some undeniable points.</i>

52
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:16,788
<i>Right now, we're gonna get</i> <i>to the next caller, Dale Denton.</i>

53
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:18,861
Hey, Sam. Big huge fan. First-time caller.

54
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:22,357
- Here's my piece. - <i>All right.</i>

55
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:25,263
If marijuana is not legal within the next five years...

56
00:04:25,436 --> 00:04:28,530
...I have no faith left in humanity, period.

57
00:04:28,706 --> 00:04:30,537
Everyone likes smoking weed.

58
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:34,144
They have for thousands of years. They're not gonna stop anytime soon.

59
00:04:34,312 --> 00:04:36,473
<i>It makes everything better. Makes</i> <i>food better. Makes music better.</i>

60
00:04:36,648 --> 00:04:38,946
<i>It makes sex feel better,</i> <i>for God's sakes.</i>

61
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:41,984
<i>It makes shitty movies better,</i> <i>you know?</i>

62
00:04:50,895 --> 00:04:53,261
Hi, there. Are you Sandra Danby?

63
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:54,455
Yeah.

64
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:59,262
Well, I'm Garth from Global Saviors, and...

65
00:04:59,437 --> 00:05:00,699
- What is this? - I'm joking.

66
00:05:00,872 --> 00:05:03,067
You failed to show up for divorce proceedings...

67
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,037
...four times under court order, and you've been served.

68
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:09,702
- Oh, great. Thanks a lot, asshole. - Sorry.

69
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:12,441
<i>I'm just saying love has no age.</i>

70
00:05:12,617 --> 00:05:15,814
You can't instantly tell me that a man, because he's a certain age...

71
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:17,955
...can't marry a woman or love a woman.

72
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:19,521
I'm dating a high-school girl.

73
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:23,422
<i>You're not maximizing your potential.</i> <i>Think this girl takes you seriously?</i>

74
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:26,961
No, but if I'm 25 and the girl is 18 years old...

75
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:29,190
...you know, in society, that might look bad.

76
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:32,461
- <i>Hey, as long as it's consensual.</i> - I think it's consensual.

77
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:35,602
Yo, you been served.

78
00:05:35,773 --> 00:05:39,209
You've been served. You've been served.

79
00:05:39,377 --> 00:05:41,436
You've been served.

80
00:05:48,753 --> 00:05:50,516
Walter Wadska the third.

81
00:05:50,688 --> 00:05:53,054
You here to fix the fax machine?

82
00:05:53,224 --> 00:05:56,455
No, I'm here to tell you you owe MasterCard 4068 bucks.

83
00:05:56,627 --> 00:05:58,993
You've been served by the best. Keep it real.

84
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:08,028
Why don't you get a real job, you fucking cocksucker?

85
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:17,441
- Hey, "Electric Avenue." - I know, right?

86
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:21,813
- Take that shit to the next level, eh? - Okay, I will.

87
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:35,859
- Dr. Edgar Terrence? - Yes.

88
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:38,524
You have repeatedly refused to trim the monkey tree...

89
00:06:38,703 --> 00:06:40,762
...that spills onto your neighbor's property.

90
00:06:40,938 --> 00:06:43,498
And now because of that, you've been served.

91
00:06:43,674 --> 00:06:44,732
You're a jerk.

92
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:46,934
All this current system is doing...

93
00:06:47,111 --> 00:06:49,341
...is putting money in the hands of criminals...

94
00:06:49,514 --> 00:06:53,211
...and it's making ordinary people like you and me deal with those criminals.

95
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:56,842
You ever dealt with a drug dealer? It's terrible, it's weird, it's awkward.

96
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:59,012
They think they're your friend, but they're not.

97
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,149
<i>Dale, I get your point. Thanks</i> <i>for your input. Next caller, please.</i>

98
00:07:15,773 --> 00:07:17,570
I can't come.

99
00:07:18,442 --> 00:07:19,932
What?

100
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:22,143
Why the fuck not, Dale?

101
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:23,610
I just... Look, I can't come.

102
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:26,545
I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow. It's a bad day for me.

103
00:07:26,717 --> 00:07:29,880
Jesus Christ, Dale. When were you gonna tell me?

104
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:31,578
My mom has been shopping all day.

105
00:07:31,756 --> 00:07:33,656
- Why? - She's already planning on couscous.

106
00:07:33,825 --> 00:07:36,794
I said I might be able to go, so why is she doing that already?

107
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:38,952
- Now I look like an asshole. - You are one.

108
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,860
Come on, don't say that. I just can't go. I have a job.

109
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:43,466
- Fine. - "Fine"?

110
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:45,101
Don't come. I don't care.

111
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:48,568
Then why have you been inviting me? I thought you wanted me to go.

112
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:51,003
If you don't wanna meet them, I don't want you to.

113
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:54,770
I want to. I can't. I have a job. I'm sorry. What do you want from me?

114
00:07:54,946 --> 00:07:57,437
I just know they'll like you, that's all.

115
00:07:57,615 --> 00:07:59,776
You're great, and you're funny...

116
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:01,851
...and you're sexy.

117
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:04,448
I just want them to see that.

118
00:08:04,622 --> 00:08:07,284
- You want them to see that I'm sexy? - Hey, people?

119
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,016
- Hi, Mr. Edwards. - Can I help you?

120
00:08:09,193 --> 00:08:11,184
No, I'm good. Thank you, though.

121
00:08:11,362 --> 00:08:14,354
Yeah? I see you don't have a visitor's badge. That's why I ask.

122
00:08:14,532 --> 00:08:17,501
- I'm with her, actually. - Actually, this is my boyfriend.

123
00:08:18,736 --> 00:08:21,967
I heard that. I wish I didn't hear that, but I just heard that.

124
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,470
What's that supposed to mean?

125
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:27,270
I'm just wondering why you don't date a nice guy your own age.

126
00:08:27,445 --> 00:08:29,413
- She's very mature for her age. - Yeah.

127
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,138
- Angie, hey. How's it going? - Hey.

128
00:08:31,315 --> 00:08:33,374
Hey, Clark, how you doing, man? What's up?

129
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:36,315
I'm good, bro. I'm good.

130
00:08:36,487 --> 00:08:38,114
Dude, I wanted to tell you.

131
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:40,154
You were hilarious today in drama class.

132
00:08:40,324 --> 00:08:42,884
Your Jeff Goldblum impression made me pee my pants.

133
00:08:43,494 --> 00:08:44,552
I wish.

134
00:08:45,463 --> 00:08:47,294
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

135
00:08:47,465 --> 00:08:49,990
Last week when we worked out, you forgot your shorts in my car.

136
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:51,532
Oh, yeah.

137
00:08:51,702 --> 00:08:53,135
- Here you go. - Thanks.

138
00:08:53,304 --> 00:08:54,703
Yeah, no problem, no problem.

139
00:08:54,872 --> 00:08:56,339
- Can you hold those? - Yeah.

140
00:08:56,507 --> 00:08:58,566
- Yeah. - How's it going, Sporty Spice?

141
00:08:58,743 --> 00:09:00,005
This is my boyfriend, Dale.

142
00:09:00,177 --> 00:09:01,644
- Hey, nice to meet you. - You too.

143
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:03,939
I've heard so much about you. You're real cool.

144
00:09:04,115 --> 00:09:06,345
- I mean, you're great. Yeah. - Yeah, awesome.

145
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:10,317
Anyways, yeah, dude, next year. Next year college, man. College.

146
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:12,752
Gonna be kick-ass. I will watch her back for you.

147
00:09:12,924 --> 00:09:16,860
I know there's tons of guys that are gonna be trying to get on that shit.

148
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:18,928
- Oh, good. - Because I got that... Yeah.

149
00:09:19,096 --> 00:09:20,723
You got her ass? Perfect.

150
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:23,765
- I'll watch her ass for... - He's trying to be nice.

151
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:26,028
- I'll catch you at Home Ec. - Okay.

152
00:09:26,203 --> 00:09:28,330
You guys got Home Ec together too. That's cool.

153
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:30,770
- We got a few classes together. - Nice to meet you.

154
00:09:30,942 --> 00:09:34,776
Time to suck today's dick. That's what I'm talking about. See you guys later.

155
00:09:34,946 --> 00:09:36,846
- All right, Clark. - Clark's a great guy.

156
00:09:37,014 --> 00:09:39,073
He's totally gonna take care of Angela, man.

157
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,413
He's great. He's a wonderful lab partner. He'll keep an eye on her.

158
00:09:42,586 --> 00:09:44,850
Why don't you go fuck yourself, you weird prick?

159
00:09:45,022 --> 00:09:47,115
I'm a teacher. You can't talk to me like that.

160
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,555
I'm not a student, so I can say whatever I want...

161
00:09:49,727 --> 00:09:51,991
...you chimp-fucking little bastard. - Actually...

162
00:09:52,163 --> 00:09:54,927
You've got T-minus 30 seconds to get off school property...

163
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:56,794
...or I call the liaison officer.

164
00:09:56,968 --> 00:10:00,096
- We're leaving. I'm sorry. - Middle finger won't stop the clock.

165
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:01,295
What a jerk.

166
00:10:01,472 --> 00:10:03,201
What's that guy's problem? Jesus.

167
00:10:03,374 --> 00:10:06,400
I don't... Normally he's... That's really weird.

168
00:10:06,577 --> 00:10:09,569
I'd love to have dinner with you and your parents tomorrow night.

169
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:12,614
I'm gonna go. I'll definitely go. I'll shuffle things around...

170
00:10:12,783 --> 00:10:14,683
- Really? - Yeah, I'll be there for sure.

171
00:10:14,852 --> 00:10:17,218
Yeah, I wanna show them you're in good hands. Yeah.

172
00:10:17,388 --> 00:10:19,117
I got nothing to be embarrassed about.

173
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,121
That means so much to me and my parents.

174
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:24,284
No problem. It's gonna be awesome.

175
00:10:25,496 --> 00:10:28,488
- <i>Hello?</i> - Hey, Saul. Mind if I come by?

176
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:31,658
- <i>Come on down.</i> - Sweet. Be there.

177
00:10:31,836 --> 00:10:33,531
- <i>Hi, Mary.</i> - <i>Hi.</i>

178
00:10:33,704 --> 00:10:36,298
<i>I thought the hurricane season</i> <i>was over.</i>

179
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:38,135
I thought hurricane season was over.

180
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:40,106
<i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>Things just got out of hand.</i>

181
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:42,643
<i>Yeah, that's the way it was</i> <i>with my first husband.</i>

182
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,516
Hello? Hey, man.

183
00:10:47,685 --> 00:10:49,448
What the fuck, man?

184
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,248
I didn't buzz you in. How the monkey did you get in here?

185
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:55,586
Some guy with a fauxhawk let me in. He was leaving when l...

186
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,853
- Fucking Kyle. - It might have been Kyle.

187
00:10:58,029 --> 00:10:59,656
- Asshole. - I'm sorry, man.

188
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,889
What the fuck's the buzzer for anyway?

189
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:05,524
I don't know. I'm sorry about that. I don't know your protocol yet.

190
00:11:05,703 --> 00:11:07,967
Stuff your sorries in a sack. It's not your fault.

191
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:11,108
- Okay. - It's these jerk-offs. Have a seat.

192
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:13,266
Okay, cool. Thanks, man. Awesome.

193
00:11:13,444 --> 00:11:15,639
Yo, check this out.

194
00:11:17,982 --> 00:11:20,712
Satellite radio.

195
00:11:20,885 --> 00:11:23,854
Got two TVs and radio. That's pretty rad.

196
00:11:24,021 --> 00:11:25,318
That's home entertainment.

197
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:28,686
You're very entertained. Oh, wow. You got a cute picture too.

198
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:30,986
Oh, yeah. Me and my <i>bubbe.</i>

199
00:11:31,462 --> 00:11:33,054
Hey, let me ask you something.

200
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,561
Yeah?

201
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:38,958
Do you think you could pull the plug on someone if you needed to?

202
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:41,195
Like, euthanasia?

203
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,365
Like, on her?

204
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:47,374
If I needed to.

205
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:53,346
I'm kind of in a hurry, man.

206
00:11:53,517 --> 00:11:56,179
I don't know if we should start going down that road.

207
00:11:56,353 --> 00:11:59,322
I could talk all day about euthanasia. Don't get me started.

208
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,014
- Maybe we should... - We'll save it.

209
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:03,524
- Save it for next time. - I'll take that rain check.

210
00:12:03,694 --> 00:12:05,127
Business for the businessman.

211
00:12:05,296 --> 00:12:07,389
- Yeah, you got my number. - Okay.

212
00:12:07,565 --> 00:12:08,998
- Brass tacks. - Yes.

213
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:12,567
Just got a shipment of the dopest dope I've ever smoked.

214
00:12:12,736 --> 00:12:14,601
Hands down, dopest dope I've ever smoked.

215
00:12:14,772 --> 00:12:17,866
Not better than the Blue Oyster. It can't be. I can't handle that.

216
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:22,706
This is like if that Blue Oyster shit met that Afghan Kush I had...

217
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,347
...and they had a baby.

218
00:12:24,515 --> 00:12:27,348
And meanwhile, that crazy Northern Lights stuff I had...

219
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:31,181
...and the Super Red Especial Snowflake met and had a baby.

220
00:12:31,355 --> 00:12:34,791
And by some miracle, those two babies met and fucked...

221
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,190
...this would be the shit that they birthed.

222
00:12:38,362 --> 00:12:40,694
- Yes. - This is the product of baby fucking.

223
00:12:40,865 --> 00:12:42,162
- Smell it. - Okay.

224
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,631
Smell it. Enjoy.

225
00:12:44,802 --> 00:12:47,999
It's like God's vagina.

226
00:12:49,573 --> 00:12:50,972
What, you wanna bathe in it?

227
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:53,042
- I wanna live in here. - You wanna be it?

228
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,338
My God, I just wanna shove it up my nose, have that smell all day.

229
00:12:56,514 --> 00:12:58,573
- That's amazing. - Shove it anywhere you like.

230
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:00,046
Beautiful. What's it called?

231
00:13:00,217 --> 00:13:02,310
- Pineapple Express. - Pineapple Express.

232
00:13:02,486 --> 00:13:04,477
It's this thing, like, El Ni隳.

233
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:07,647
This airflow that comes from Hawaii and Canada.

234
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:10,726
It gets the dirt, mixes it in with the weed in a special way.

235
00:13:10,895 --> 00:13:13,227
It's very scientific. I won't go into it right now.

236
00:13:13,397 --> 00:13:16,059
But I am the only guy in the whole city that has it.

237
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:17,791
Only 10 bones more for a quarter.

238
00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:19,663
Okay, I'll take a quarter.

239
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:21,828
- All right, you're on. - Thank you very much.

240
00:13:22,006 --> 00:13:23,337
Let me get my scale.

241
00:13:23,507 --> 00:13:26,908
Get it going. Grab the scale. Let's get me out of here.

242
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:30,879
I thought hurricane season was over.

243
00:13:31,782 --> 00:13:34,114
Oh, crow.

244
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:39,254
Where are you, you little fucker?

245
00:13:40,658 --> 00:13:43,889
What the fuck is this thing?

246
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:46,528
- Cross joint. - Yeah.

247
00:13:46,697 --> 00:13:49,063
- You ever smoke one of those? - You can smoke this?

248
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:50,291
- Yeah, man. - No.

249
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:52,560
This is the future.

250
00:13:52,736 --> 00:13:57,537
This is, like, the apex of the vortex of joint engineering.

251
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,973
It's rumored that M. M. O'Shaughnessy designed the first one.

252
00:14:01,145 --> 00:14:03,705
The guy who designed the Golden Gate Bridge.

253
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:06,145
My second favorite civil engineer...

254
00:14:06,317 --> 00:14:10,185
...behind Hannskarl Bandel, Madison Square Garden.

255
00:14:10,354 --> 00:14:14,154
What you do is you light all three ends at the same time.

256
00:14:14,325 --> 00:14:17,590
- Really? - And then the smoke converges...

257
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:21,822
...creating a trifecta of joint-smoking power.

258
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:25,230
This is it, man. This is what your grandchildren are gonna be smoking.

259
00:14:25,402 --> 00:14:27,393
Future. The future.

260
00:14:27,571 --> 00:14:30,131
That's amazing. Well, got the weed?

261
00:14:30,307 --> 00:14:33,208
- Yeah. - In the bag. Beautiful. Okay.

262
00:14:33,877 --> 00:14:37,313
Be careful with that thing, man. Here's the cash, grab the stash.

263
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:39,244
Alrighty, man, thanks. Have a good one.

264
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,213
Don't hurt yourself. Adios.

265
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:43,512
Well, hey, wait a minute, man.

266
00:14:43,687 --> 00:14:45,416
Let's smoke this fucking thing.

267
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:47,420
I really... I can't, man. I gotta...

268
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:49,718
I can't even light this thing on my own.

269
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,827
I need your help, man.

270
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,261
- I'm in. - Come on!

271
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:58,230
- Why not? Let's do it. - Come on down!

272
00:14:58,402 --> 00:15:00,267
Why not? What do I do?

273
00:15:00,437 --> 00:15:01,597
Okay, here's what you do.

274
00:15:01,772 --> 00:15:03,501
- You equip yourself. - I'm equipping.

275
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:05,073
- Equip me, sir. - Okay.

276
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:10,106
You are going to light these two ends while I light this end.

277
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:12,044
- Okay. - Are you ready?

278
00:15:12,216 --> 00:15:15,083
- Ready. - Blast off.

279
00:15:31,201 --> 00:15:33,795
- I'm gonna do it. - Good. Go for it.

280
00:15:45,616 --> 00:15:47,345
It's better to cough.

281
00:15:47,518 --> 00:15:49,042
It's like...

282
00:15:49,219 --> 00:15:50,811
Makes you 10 times more higher...

283
00:15:50,988 --> 00:15:53,252
...than the cross weed and the Pineapple Express.

284
00:15:53,424 --> 00:15:57,224
You're like, totally fucking <i>Gong Show'ed,</i> man.

285
00:16:10,174 --> 00:16:11,573
Oh, fuck.

286
00:16:11,742 --> 00:16:13,209
Hang on one second, man.

287
00:16:13,377 --> 00:16:14,401
Oh, you fucker.

288
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,578
Who is it?

289
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:22,582
<i>It's Chris Gebert, man. Let me up.</i>

290
00:16:22,753 --> 00:16:23,947
Shit.

291
00:16:24,355 --> 00:16:25,686
What's a Gebert?

292
00:16:25,856 --> 00:16:27,448
Come on up.

293
00:16:27,624 --> 00:16:30,957
He ain't getting any of that Pineapple Express.

294
00:16:31,128 --> 00:16:35,497
Chris is getting Snicklefritz.

295
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:38,800
Hey.

296
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:40,960
So listen, man.

297
00:16:41,138 --> 00:16:43,538
I gotta ask you. So...

298
00:16:43,707 --> 00:16:47,666
Listen, man. You've been buying from me for, like, two months, right?

299
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:50,143
- Two months. - I gotta ask, man.

300
00:16:50,314 --> 00:16:51,838
What's up with the suit?

301
00:16:52,015 --> 00:16:54,813
I'm a process server. So I have to wear a suit.

302
00:16:54,985 --> 00:16:59,354
Wow, you're a servant? Like a butler?

303
00:16:59,523 --> 00:17:02,754
- A chauffeur? - No. No. What? No, I'm not...

304
00:17:02,926 --> 00:17:05,986
- Shine shoes? - I'm a process server.

305
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:07,653
- I like... - In process.

306
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:09,799
I work for a company that's, like, hired...

307
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:11,958
...by lawyers to hand out legal documents.

308
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:14,263
Like subpoenas to people who don't want them.

309
00:17:14,438 --> 00:17:18,238
I gotta wear disguises sometimes just to make them admit they're themselves...

310
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:20,673
...so I can serve them the papers.

311
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:21,868
Disguise.

312
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:23,171
Kind of, I guess.

313
00:17:23,347 --> 00:17:25,372
- It's a hell of a job. - That's cool, man.

314
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:29,713
Like a day-to-day basis, it's fine. Like today, I, like, sat in my car...

315
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:31,354
...I smoked, like, 10 doobies...

316
00:17:31,522 --> 00:17:34,013
...and then I went to go visit my girlfriend at lunch.

317
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:35,818
Nice.

318
00:17:35,993 --> 00:17:38,427
What? You sucked on her titties?

319
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:41,655
No, I just kissed her. I just did that to make it seem cool.

320
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:44,323
That's cool. Does she like to smoke weed?

321
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:46,594
A little sometimes. She has a couple...

322
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,534
She's in high school, so as much as any high-school kid.

323
00:17:49,706 --> 00:17:51,537
She's cool as hell, actually.

324
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,437
- You'd get along with her. - Really?

325
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,340
Yeah, you know, it only sucks...

326
00:17:56,513 --> 00:18:00,244
...when I go visit her in high school and the guys she goes to school with...

327
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:02,851
...are strong and handsome and really funny.

328
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,887
Like, do good impressions of Jeff Goldblum and shit like that.

329
00:18:06,056 --> 00:18:11,050
And, like, I just feel like a fat, dumb, fucking stinky ass-turd when I'm there.

330
00:18:11,228 --> 00:18:13,423
- What? - It really... It sucks for my ego.

331
00:18:13,597 --> 00:18:15,963
- Fuck Jeff Goldblum, man. - That's what I say.

332
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:18,829
You know, don't get down on yourself. You got a great girl.

333
00:18:19,002 --> 00:18:21,402
You got a great job where you don't do anything.

334
00:18:21,572 --> 00:18:23,699
You get to smoke weed all day.

335
00:18:23,874 --> 00:18:25,239
I wish I had that.

336
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:28,742
Are you kidd...? You do. You have the easiest job on Earth.

337
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:31,972
- You do smoke weed all day. - That's true.

338
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:34,617
You didn't think of that.

339
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:36,844
- I do have a good job. - Yeah, you do nothing.

340
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,248
- Thanks, man. - No prob.

341
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:40,049
Thank you.

342
00:18:40,224 --> 00:18:43,352
Oh, shit. All right. Business.

343
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:46,326
- Got my persona. - Yeah, yeah.

344
00:18:46,497 --> 00:18:47,987
Hey. Put that cross joint out.

345
00:18:48,165 --> 00:18:50,599
He sees that, he'll never get the fuck out of here.

346
00:18:52,436 --> 00:18:53,960
- What's up, Chris? - Yo, hey, Saul.

347
00:18:54,137 --> 00:18:55,468
- Hey. - How you doing, buddy?

348
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:56,936
All right, homes. Good.

349
00:18:57,107 --> 00:18:59,234
- Who's this? - Hey. Oh, that's my friend Mark.

350
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:01,377
You got the dough? There you go.

351
00:19:01,545 --> 00:19:03,672
- Appreciate it. - Nice. Good to meet you, Mark.

352
00:19:04,181 --> 00:19:06,240
- Do you have any Percocet, please? - Percocet?

353
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,748
What are you talking about? I don't sell that shit.

354
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:09,943
- Chris. - Chris.

355
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,883
You told him I was gonna sell Percocet?

356
00:19:12,055 --> 00:19:14,546
- I didn't say anything about Percocet. - What the fuck?

357
00:19:14,725 --> 00:19:16,920
- I just wanted a couple Percocets. - Well, I...

358
00:19:17,094 --> 00:19:18,994
You came to the wrong place. Wrong place.

359
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:22,029
- Sorry. - Yeah, nice. Peace out, homes.

360
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:23,461
- Thank... - God.

361
00:19:23,634 --> 00:19:25,625
- What the fuck? - Yeah.

362
00:19:25,802 --> 00:19:27,633
- Fucking lingerer. - Yeah, totally.

363
00:19:27,804 --> 00:19:29,169
- Lingerer. - Hardcore.

364
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:30,829
Fuck.

365
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:33,572
- Bums me out. - Bums me out too.

366
00:19:33,744 --> 00:19:37,339
If there's one quality I hate in a person, it's lingering.

367
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:40,210
- That's right. You and me both. - Yeah, yeah.

368
00:19:40,384 --> 00:19:43,649
So I'm curious. What have those people done that you go...

369
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,879
...and process and service?

370
00:19:46,056 --> 00:19:48,581
I don't know. It's always something different, I guess.

371
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:50,021
This guy...

372
00:19:50,193 --> 00:19:52,889
Ted Jones, who knows. You know?

373
00:19:53,063 --> 00:19:55,327
- Ted Jones? - Yeah, why?

374
00:19:55,499 --> 00:19:59,299
My guy, Red, who I buy from, he gets his stuff from a Ted Jones.

375
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:01,369
- Really? - Maybe it's the same guy.

376
00:20:01,538 --> 00:20:02,562
That'd be weird.

377
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:05,299
It's a pretty normal name, I guess, but...

378
00:20:05,475 --> 00:20:09,002
Anyway, I should really get going, man. I gotta go.

379
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,511
Duty calls, but it's good to see you. Thanks.

380
00:20:11,682 --> 00:20:14,310
You're gonna smoke and run? Come on, man.

381
00:20:14,484 --> 00:20:17,578
We can go look at some crazy things on the Internet together.

382
00:20:17,754 --> 00:20:20,882
That sounds appealing, but you know what? I'll tell... Here...

383
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:23,993
I'm gonna run out of weed in a couple days. I'll come by, hang out.

384
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:26,925
- We'll watch <i>227</i> and shit. - Definitely.

385
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:28,997
Cool, man. Well, thanks. Good to see you.

386
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,326
- Peace, brother. - Okay.

387
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,990
One love.

388
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:32,569
<i>When you got behind</i> <i>on the mortgage...</i>

389
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:34,230
<i>When you got behind</i> <i>on the mortgage...</i>

390
00:20:34,404 --> 00:20:36,201
<i>... someone finally</i> <i>made you a loan?</i>

391
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:37,465
<i>Yes, he did.</i>

392
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:40,235
<i>Yes, he did.</i> <i>What was the interest rate you got?</i>

393
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:45,006
- <i>It was 12 or 13 percent.</i> - <i>That's disgusting.</i>

394
00:20:54,691 --> 00:20:56,522
- Hello? - <i>Hello.</i>

395
00:20:56,693 --> 00:20:58,320
Hey, Angie, what's happening?

396
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:01,953
<i>I just talked to my mom, and they are</i> <i>so excited you're coming for dinner.</i>

397
00:21:02,132 --> 00:21:05,260
<i>Like, so excited. And so am I,</i> <i>but we're all really excited.</i>

398
00:21:05,435 --> 00:21:06,459
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

399
00:21:06,637 --> 00:21:08,969
No problem. I'm psyched too. It's gonna be awesome.

400
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:12,802
Couscous. The food so nice, they named it twice.

401
00:21:14,277 --> 00:21:17,678
<i>Dale, anyway, I can't wait</i> <i>for next year when this bullshit's over.</i>

402
00:21:17,848 --> 00:21:20,749
Oh, shit. I see the guy I gotta serve. I'll call you back.

403
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:22,851
Fucking cops. Shit.

404
00:21:29,926 --> 00:21:31,757
Jesus.

405
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:38,958
What an adorable little cop.

406
00:21:39,469 --> 00:21:41,061
Weird.

407
00:21:45,976 --> 00:21:47,466
Jesus. Fuck.

408
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:49,669
What the fuck was that?

409
00:21:49,846 --> 00:21:51,108
Oh, shit.

410
00:21:52,182 --> 00:21:54,946
Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude.

411
00:21:55,118 --> 00:21:56,142
Oh, no!

412
00:22:08,298 --> 00:22:11,290
- Drive, drive. - Who the fuck is that?

413
00:22:11,468 --> 00:22:13,459
I don't know, but I ain't waiting to see.

414
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,392
Pineapple Express.

415
00:22:47,337 --> 00:22:49,498
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

416
00:22:49,673 --> 00:22:51,163
I saw brains and blood!

417
00:22:51,341 --> 00:22:52,808
Come on! Come on!

418
00:22:52,976 --> 00:22:54,034
Where do I go?

419
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,484
Hello?

420
00:23:11,661 --> 00:23:13,390
Saul, it's Dale. Let me in. Let me in.

421
00:23:13,563 --> 00:23:16,031
I just saw some crazy shit. Please. Let me in.

422
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:18,997
- <i>It's Dale Denton. Let me in, man.</i> - Dale?

423
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:21,797
<i>Yes, Dale. That's what I said.</i> <i>It's Dale. Let me in.</i>

424
00:23:21,972 --> 00:23:24,031
Oh, all right, man. Come on up.

425
00:23:28,044 --> 00:23:30,205
I buzzed it. Open the door when I buzz it.

426
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,211
<i>Buzz it in three seconds exactly.</i>

427
00:23:32,382 --> 00:23:34,850
One, two...

428
00:23:35,018 --> 00:23:37,043
- Did it work? - On three!

429
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,053
I did it on three. On "one, two, three, go"?

430
00:23:40,223 --> 00:23:41,986
<i>Just on three.</i>

431
00:23:52,235 --> 00:23:54,567
- He fucking killed him. - Hey, I got neighbors.

432
00:23:54,738 --> 00:23:56,205
He fucking killed him.

433
00:23:56,373 --> 00:23:59,342
- Who killed who? - A cop. A lady and a guy.

434
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:02,603
A cop, a lady and a guy? That's a massacre. You saw it?

435
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:04,804
No, it was just a guy.

436
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:06,642
- What happened to the lady? - No. No.

437
00:24:06,817 --> 00:24:11,481
A woman. A policewoman and a guy, another guy, shot another guy...

438
00:24:11,655 --> 00:24:14,647
...an Asian guy, in the window, at fucking Ted's house.

439
00:24:14,825 --> 00:24:16,383
Whoa, was the other guy Ted?

440
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,653
I don't know. He was a big, gray-haired man...

441
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:20,558
...and he had a robe and he shot him.

442
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,665
And his brain flew every... I'm gonna be... I'm gonna throw up.

443
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,267
What?

444
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:28,735
- That was chicken fries. - Sick.

445
00:24:28,905 --> 00:24:30,304
You threw up on my printer.

446
00:24:30,473 --> 00:24:31,838
- I did. - Did you break it?

447
00:24:32,008 --> 00:24:33,908
- I hope not. - Listen, man.

448
00:24:34,077 --> 00:24:35,567
I think the guy was Ted.

449
00:24:35,745 --> 00:24:37,576
And the Asians are number-two in town...

450
00:24:37,747 --> 00:24:39,681
...so you saw Ted capping the competition.

451
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,647
They saw me seeing them shoot the guy.

452
00:24:41,818 --> 00:24:43,479
What? They saw you?

453
00:24:43,653 --> 00:24:45,018
And you fucking came here?

454
00:24:45,188 --> 00:24:47,156
- Did they follow you here? - I don't know.

455
00:24:47,324 --> 00:24:51,590
- Did they follow you here? - I don't know. Look. Look. Okay.

456
00:24:53,129 --> 00:24:54,460
I saw them kill him.

457
00:24:54,631 --> 00:24:57,361
I freaked out. I panicked, okay?

458
00:24:57,534 --> 00:24:59,661
I tossed my roach.

459
00:24:59,836 --> 00:25:02,304
- I crashed into two cars. - Yeah.

460
00:25:02,472 --> 00:25:05,600
So they must have heard... They know someone was out there.

461
00:25:05,775 --> 00:25:07,902
- They know someone saw. - They know "someone."

462
00:25:08,078 --> 00:25:10,706
They don't know it was you. Right?

463
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:14,282
I don't... I mean, yeah. I don't know.

464
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:16,009
- Yes. - I hope not.

465
00:25:16,186 --> 00:25:17,244
Relax.

466
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:22,187
Just sit back. Get ready to enjoy some of the rarest weed known to mankind.

467
00:25:24,661 --> 00:25:26,219
Is it really that rare?

468
00:25:26,663 --> 00:25:28,722
It's, like, the rarest.

469
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:31,360
It's almost a shame to smoke it.

470
00:25:32,135 --> 00:25:35,502
It's like killing a unicorn...

471
00:25:35,672 --> 00:25:37,401
...with, like, a bomb.

472
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:41,837
Are you the only guy in town who has this?

473
00:25:42,012 --> 00:25:44,139
- You're actually the only guy? - Yeah.

474
00:25:44,314 --> 00:25:47,909
My guy Red said he was giving me an exclusive sneak preview.

475
00:25:48,084 --> 00:25:51,144
I'm the only guy you sold it to? The other guys got Snicklefritz?

476
00:25:51,321 --> 00:25:54,415
Yeah. So we're, like, the only guys.

477
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:56,388
And Red got this from Ted?

478
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,890
Ted's the man.

479
00:25:58,595 --> 00:26:01,621
Let's get the fuck out of here! Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go!

480
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:04,130
I threw a roach of this outside of Ted's house.

481
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:06,292
So what? I throw roaches all over town.

482
00:26:06,469 --> 00:26:09,870
No. He could find the roach and say, "It's Pineapple Express.

483
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,235
Saul is the only guy who has Pineapple Express.

484
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:14,502
He must have seen the murder! Let's kill him!"

485
00:26:14,678 --> 00:26:16,111
- Let's get out of here! - Fuck!

486
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:19,077
Wait! Stop! Get weed! Get the weed!

487
00:26:19,249 --> 00:26:22,446
Anything we might need. Snacks, food, Fruit Roll-Ups.

488
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:24,712
- Let's get the fuck out of here! - Okay, okay.

489
00:26:43,773 --> 00:26:45,968
Red said he'd be here.

490
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:55,915
Them some drugs.

491
00:26:58,088 --> 00:26:59,646
Smells like vomit in this house.

492
00:26:59,823 --> 00:27:01,723
Want a hit, man? It's still lit.

493
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:04,052
I'm having dinner with my wife. She can tell.

494
00:27:04,227 --> 00:27:05,888
Smell it on my sweater.

495
00:27:06,062 --> 00:27:07,495
For real?

496
00:27:07,664 --> 00:27:08,961
Yeah, for real.

497
00:27:09,132 --> 00:27:11,930
You wanna wear my vest? It smell good.

498
00:27:12,102 --> 00:27:13,160
Not my style.

499
00:27:13,336 --> 00:27:15,702
You ain't got no style, motherfucker.

500
00:27:15,872 --> 00:27:18,306
<i>You have reached</i> <i>the voice mailbox of...</i>

501
00:27:18,475 --> 00:27:20,102
- <i>Ted.</i> - Ted, it's Budlofsky.

502
00:27:20,276 --> 00:27:23,074
- We're here. Saul's gone. - And Mathe...

503
00:27:24,614 --> 00:27:27,276
- And Matheson. - I think he knew we were coming.

504
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,576
They not here, Ted.

505
00:27:28,752 --> 00:27:30,447
Hi, Ted.

506
00:27:31,054 --> 00:27:33,318
Okay, what do you know about Ted?

507
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,253
I think he's crazy about murdering.

508
00:27:35,425 --> 00:27:37,620
Well, that's not good. Where are we gonna go?

509
00:27:37,794 --> 00:27:41,662
Let's just go... Go to a motel or a hotel and just hide out.

510
00:27:41,831 --> 00:27:45,426
The police were in on it. Could have flagged credit cards. They'll find us.

511
00:27:46,036 --> 00:27:49,597
Shit. I wish we could just go nowhere.

512
00:27:51,775 --> 00:27:52,935
Okay.

513
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:58,809
Even if he found that roach, how could he know where you are?

514
00:28:00,283 --> 00:28:02,114
Heat-seeking missiles.

515
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,946
Bloodhounds.

516
00:28:06,022 --> 00:28:07,546
Foxes.

517
00:28:07,724 --> 00:28:09,351
Barracudas.

518
00:28:09,526 --> 00:28:12,723
I'm kind of flabbergasted when you say things like that. It's weird.

519
00:28:12,896 --> 00:28:13,920
Thank you.

520
00:28:14,097 --> 00:28:16,122
Not a compliment. Here's the question.

521
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:18,233
Let's say he actually found the roach.

522
00:28:18,401 --> 00:28:22,599
How could he connect the Pineapple Express weed to you?

523
00:28:22,772 --> 00:28:26,105
He can't, man. Only fucking Red knows.

524
00:28:26,276 --> 00:28:28,141
Only Red knows, man.

525
00:28:28,311 --> 00:28:29,744
Who is Red?

526
00:28:29,913 --> 00:28:33,576
Red's, like, the middleman between, like, Ted and me.

527
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,809
And we're, like, mad fucking tight, man.

528
00:28:35,985 --> 00:28:38,078
One time, he got this girl...

529
00:28:38,254 --> 00:28:41,655
...to give me a hand job, like, within five minutes of meeting her.

530
00:28:41,825 --> 00:28:46,387
It was like, "I don't even know your name, whoa."

531
00:28:46,763 --> 00:28:51,723
That is pretty rad, but, like, let's say Ted calls him and is like:

532
00:28:51,901 --> 00:28:54,028
"Did you sell the Pineapple Express to anyone?"

533
00:28:54,204 --> 00:28:56,832
He'll be, "Yeah, I sold it to Saul." Why wouldn't he?

534
00:28:57,006 --> 00:28:59,702
No. Oh, no. Fuck that, man.

535
00:28:59,876 --> 00:29:03,471
Fucking hand job, Dale. Imagine if I gave you a hand job.

536
00:29:03,646 --> 00:29:07,480
- Why would I wanna do that? - No, I mean if I got you a hand job.

537
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:10,118
The same rules don't apply to Red. He's a drug dealer.

538
00:29:12,122 --> 00:29:15,888
I'm a drug dealer. Are you saying you don't trust me?

539
00:29:16,693 --> 00:29:19,184
No, that's not at all what I'm... You know what?

540
00:29:19,362 --> 00:29:23,321
You know? Just ignore what I said. Call him. Give him a call.

541
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,127
See what the dealio is.

542
00:29:28,838 --> 00:29:30,635
- Hello. - <i>Hey, Red, you okay?</i>

543
00:29:30,807 --> 00:29:33,901
<i>Yeah, Saul. Yeah, I'm fine, man.</i> <i>I just stubbed my toe.</i>

544
00:29:34,077 --> 00:29:37,069
Be careful, man. Be careful. Wear shoes in the house.

545
00:29:37,247 --> 00:29:40,273
Safety. Safety first, then teamwork. Now, listen.

546
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,941
You know that Pineapple Express stuff you gave me?

547
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:45,747
Don't tell anybody that you sold it to me.

548
00:29:45,922 --> 00:29:47,219
I'd never talk to anyone...

549
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:51,622
...about the stuff that I do with you involving drugs.

550
00:29:51,794 --> 00:29:54,285
All right, cool. Listen, I'm gonna come by.

551
00:29:54,464 --> 00:29:56,295
I gotta lay some shit on you.

552
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:58,058
There is a fly in the ointment.

553
00:29:58,234 --> 00:30:00,794
Shit has hit the fan. The lion will speak.

554
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,268
- I'm in the middle of a convo. - No, seriously.

555
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:05,930
- We're gonna be there in half an hour. - <i>Perfect.</i>

556
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:09,101
- No, please. No, no, no. - Let's go over there and chill out.

557
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,747
No, can we go tomorrow? Look, we're already here...

558
00:30:11,915 --> 00:30:14,349
There's somebody else on the phone with him.

559
00:30:14,517 --> 00:30:15,541
- Who? - I don't know.

560
00:30:15,718 --> 00:30:17,345
He's whispering to another man.

561
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,353
We'll go in the morning. It's better that way.

562
00:30:20,523 --> 00:30:24,015
- Okay. - Yes. Yes. Thank you. Yes.

563
00:30:24,194 --> 00:30:26,594
- <i>Hey.</i> - So you're coming by tomorrow?

564
00:30:26,763 --> 00:30:27,821
How'd you know that?

565
00:30:27,997 --> 00:30:31,865
Heard you whispering to that other guy that you were talking to. Who is that?

566
00:30:32,035 --> 00:30:34,731
Right, Dale. Good job. Listen, I can't go in the morning...

567
00:30:34,904 --> 00:30:37,634
...because my <i>bubbe...</i> Gotta change her clocks. Daylight-savings.

568
00:30:37,807 --> 00:30:40,332
Is that the <i>bubbe</i> that's on 41 st and River Street?

569
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,910
The one where we played shuffleboard that one time?

570
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:45,707
You got it. So, listen, we'll be chilling by noon.

571
00:30:46,182 --> 00:30:48,980
- Noon it is, bromosexual. - <i>Nice.</i>

572
00:30:49,152 --> 00:30:51,848
We should hit up the casino again. It's been a while.

573
00:30:52,021 --> 00:30:54,683
<i>Okay, yeah.</i> <i>We'll definitely hit the casino up.</i>

574
00:30:54,857 --> 00:30:58,122
Definitely. All right, peace, brother.

575
00:31:01,831 --> 00:31:03,992
I should call Angie soon.

576
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:07,193
Make up some bullshit.

577
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,462
I'm cold.

578
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:11,698
You're cold? Oh, I'm not cold at all. Here.

579
00:31:11,874 --> 00:31:12,898
I run hot.

580
00:31:13,076 --> 00:31:14,373
- Really? - Yeah.

581
00:31:14,544 --> 00:31:17,843
- You got more body mass. - Thick blood. Yeah, no, take it.

582
00:31:18,014 --> 00:31:21,245
- Thank you. - I don't appreciate that, but it's okay.

583
00:31:21,651 --> 00:31:23,642
I'm gonna call Angie.

584
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,887
Space.

585
00:31:34,097 --> 00:31:35,496
Dale, wait. Wait.

586
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,267
The phones. The phones.

587
00:31:39,435 --> 00:31:41,699
- You said they were cops, right? - They are, yeah.

588
00:31:41,871 --> 00:31:43,429
I was thinking, maybe they can...

589
00:31:43,606 --> 00:31:46,336
...triangulate these things, man, or, like, trace them.

590
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:48,409
- Right? - That's how they got Saddam.

591
00:31:48,578 --> 00:31:50,443
- Right. - Fuck. You're right, man.

592
00:31:50,613 --> 00:31:52,274
Maybe they can even trace them...

593
00:31:52,448 --> 00:31:54,882
...like, when we're not even on them, you know?

594
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:58,543
Maybe if we bury them, the reception will cut off and they won't be able to.

595
00:31:58,721 --> 00:32:00,689
We can tie it to an animal, be a diversion.

596
00:32:00,857 --> 00:32:02,324
We'll never catch an animal.

597
00:32:02,492 --> 00:32:04,960
The squirrel'd be up in a tree, they'd think we were.

598
00:32:05,128 --> 00:32:06,720
No, no, no.

599
00:32:06,896 --> 00:32:09,262
- We'll build a hot-air balloon and... - No.

600
00:32:09,432 --> 00:32:10,831
- We'll smash them. - Yeah, yeah.

601
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,399
I'm gonna smash it. On a rock.

602
00:32:12,568 --> 00:32:15,503
- Right here. Good thinking. - Good idea. Yes, destroy it.

603
00:32:15,672 --> 00:32:17,867
- Get it. - Die. Yes.

604
00:32:19,542 --> 00:32:22,705
- What the fuck was that? - I was trying to hit that tree. I missed.

605
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:25,074
- What tree? - That one.

606
00:32:25,248 --> 00:32:27,773
Why didn't you smash it on a rock like a normal person?

607
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,817
I don't know. How often does somebody smash things? I'm rusty.

608
00:32:30,987 --> 00:32:32,921
Did you at least see where it landed?

609
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:34,716
I don't know. Call it.

610
00:32:35,358 --> 00:32:38,589
Call it? With what? My phone has been smashed.

611
00:32:40,263 --> 00:32:42,390
I bet they can't even triangulate those things.

612
00:32:42,565 --> 00:32:46,023
Well, you convinced me they can. You were very convincing back there.

613
00:32:46,202 --> 00:32:48,796
Hey. Fine. I'll go find it. Fuck.

614
00:32:48,971 --> 00:32:51,098
- Do you see it? - See what?

615
00:32:51,274 --> 00:32:53,538
The phone, you idiot.

616
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,474
Why are we here? This place is so fucking scary.

617
00:32:56,646 --> 00:32:58,944
At least I had an idea. You didn't, so shut up.

618
00:32:59,115 --> 00:33:01,879
That's not true. I had two ideas. Nowhere and Quiznos.

619
00:33:02,518 --> 00:33:04,042
- What? - What was that?

620
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,278
- What? - What is that?

621
00:33:05,455 --> 00:33:08,356
- What? - I hear something.

622
00:33:08,524 --> 00:33:09,548
What?

623
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:11,591
I don't know. Do you hear that?

624
00:33:11,761 --> 00:33:14,127
Dude, I literally hear nothing.

625
00:33:15,031 --> 00:33:16,055
Oh, fuck!

626
00:33:16,232 --> 00:33:19,599
Where are you going? What are you running from? Return to me now!

627
00:33:22,138 --> 00:33:23,162
Help me!

628
00:33:24,173 --> 00:33:25,663
Tell him to get away from me!

629
00:33:25,842 --> 00:33:28,037
I'm scared of this darkness! I surrender!

630
00:33:28,211 --> 00:33:30,042
- Go away! Go away! - I'm unarmed!

631
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:33,849
- This isn't funny anymore! - Dale!

632
00:33:34,016 --> 00:33:35,779
- Fall back! - Save me!

633
00:33:48,631 --> 00:33:49,962
Oh, shit.

634
00:33:51,968 --> 00:33:52,992
Car.

635
00:34:01,411 --> 00:34:03,345
Open it! Open it! Open the door! Open it!

636
00:34:03,513 --> 00:34:05,777
- Unlock it. - I can't unlock it.

637
00:34:05,948 --> 00:34:08,246
What are you doing? Watch the upholstery.

638
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:12,081
- Go! I saw something! - No! What did you see? Shut up!

639
00:34:12,255 --> 00:34:15,747
Shut the fuck... Shut up, man!

640
00:34:15,925 --> 00:34:18,189
I heard something, then I saw something.

641
00:34:18,361 --> 00:34:20,056
You didn't hear anything, man.

642
00:34:20,229 --> 00:34:22,094
Well, I saw something.

643
00:34:25,902 --> 00:34:29,269
<i>And you're telling me that guy</i> <i>in the little short shorts...</i>

644
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:30,804
- <i>... broke your nose?</i> - <i>Right.</i>

645
00:34:30,973 --> 00:34:34,875
<i>The BeDazzler guy</i> <i>broke your nose, tough man?</i>

646
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,891
Wake up. Get up. Wake up.

647
00:34:52,628 --> 00:34:54,858
How did I get on you?

648
00:34:55,598 --> 00:34:57,293
I wonder.

649
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:03,168
Watch finally broke.

650
00:35:03,339 --> 00:35:04,931
Crazy. What time is it?

651
00:35:08,778 --> 00:35:10,075
That can't be right.

652
00:35:11,347 --> 00:35:13,406
It couldn't be 3 in the morning, could it?

653
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:15,676
It's 3:00 right now?

654
00:35:15,852 --> 00:35:17,376
Holy shit, man!

655
00:35:17,553 --> 00:35:21,045
We were supposed to be at Red's at noon, man. What if he's gone?

656
00:35:21,224 --> 00:35:22,691
No, it's daylight-savings, so...

657
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:25,851
- So it's only 2:00. - Oh, no, it went forward an hour.

658
00:35:26,028 --> 00:35:30,328
It's 4 o'-fucking-clock? Fuck me. No, man. That's bad.

659
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:33,658
Shit. We slept for, like, 18 hours.

660
00:35:33,836 --> 00:35:36,361
My <i>bubbe...</i> Man, my <i>bubbe's</i> gonna be so pissed.

661
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:37,597
Shit.

662
00:35:37,773 --> 00:35:39,604
We gotta call Red.

663
00:35:39,775 --> 00:35:42,369
Okay. How?

664
00:35:42,545 --> 00:35:44,570
We'll go to a pay phone.

665
00:35:44,747 --> 00:35:48,012
No, I can't. His number is in my phone.

666
00:35:48,184 --> 00:35:50,175
Great. Well, do you remember where he lives?

667
00:35:50,353 --> 00:35:51,650
Yeah, I know where he lives.

668
00:35:51,821 --> 00:35:53,948
What are you insinuating? Like, I'm forgetful?

669
00:35:54,123 --> 00:35:55,556
"Insinuating." Good word.

670
00:35:55,725 --> 00:35:57,022
Do you know what that means?

671
00:35:57,193 --> 00:36:00,185
- I do, believe it or not. - It means, like, "to seem like."

672
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:05,126
Let's roll. I'm done with the woods. Let's go.

673
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:07,292
Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.

674
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:11,372
Okay. Let's go. No. It's not working. The battery's dead.

675
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:13,168
Wait.

676
00:36:14,143 --> 00:36:15,474
What do you mean, it's dead?

677
00:36:15,645 --> 00:36:19,172
What do I mean? I mean the battery's dead. The battery's dead.

678
00:36:19,348 --> 00:36:21,009
What do you mean, the battery's dead?

679
00:36:21,183 --> 00:36:23,674
How can I explain this to you differently?

680
00:36:23,853 --> 00:36:26,845
The battery is dead. It ceased to live.

681
00:36:27,023 --> 00:36:30,550
It's deceased now. The car needs a battery to start, Saul.

682
00:36:31,827 --> 00:36:33,454
How did this happen?

683
00:36:33,629 --> 00:36:36,393
Well, we clearly fell asleep with the battery on, and...

684
00:36:36,566 --> 00:36:38,500
Oh, man. To talk radio?

685
00:36:38,668 --> 00:36:41,068
- Yes, talk radio. - It's so boring, man.

686
00:36:41,237 --> 00:36:44,001
- Okay, okay. - The car just committed suicide.

687
00:36:44,173 --> 00:36:46,300
Shut up, man. I have an idea now.

688
00:36:46,475 --> 00:36:47,737
We're gonna go.

689
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,606
We'll walk back to the road. We'll hitchhike.

690
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,714
Someone will pick us up, take us to Red's.

691
00:36:52,882 --> 00:36:56,113
Red will tell us everything's fine, everything will go back to normal.

692
00:36:56,285 --> 00:36:57,547
How does that sound? Good?

693
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,551
- That's a good idea. - Keep our heads on.

694
00:36:59,722 --> 00:37:02,316
If we just keep thinking like this, we're fucking gravy.

695
00:37:02,491 --> 00:37:04,516
- All right. I'm in. - Let's do it.

696
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:15,369
- Can I have my jacket back, please? - Yeah.

697
00:37:15,538 --> 00:37:17,938
- Thank you. - Thank you.

698
00:37:18,107 --> 00:37:20,007
Thanks for taking care of it.

699
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,048
Look, it's like my thumb is my cock.

700
00:38:06,288 --> 00:38:08,722
That's not gonna get us a ride, man.

701
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:17,728
Here's good.

702
00:38:23,506 --> 00:38:25,337
Thanks for the smooth sailing, Sharid.

703
00:38:25,508 --> 00:38:27,066
You're welcome.

704
00:38:32,248 --> 00:38:34,580
- You're sure we can trust this guy? - Yo, Red.

705
00:38:35,284 --> 00:38:36,376
Who is it?

706
00:38:36,552 --> 00:38:40,215
- It's Bruce. - Bruce? Who the fuck is this?

707
00:38:40,389 --> 00:38:43,552
- Saul. What's up? - Who do you think it is?

708
00:38:43,726 --> 00:38:44,750
Who's this?

709
00:38:44,927 --> 00:38:46,895
I'm Dale, Mr. Red. Nice to meet you.

710
00:38:47,063 --> 00:38:48,087
Dale who?

711
00:38:48,264 --> 00:38:50,232
It's best if you don't know my full name.

712
00:38:50,399 --> 00:38:51,661
Dale Denton. He's with me.

713
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:54,166
Dale Denton. Nice to meet you, bro.

714
00:38:54,336 --> 00:38:57,066
- Hold on. Let me get this lock, okay? - You better.

715
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,537
- Get in here. - Coming in.

716
00:38:59,709 --> 00:39:02,405
- Y'all wanna buy some drugs? - Frisk me.

717
00:39:02,578 --> 00:39:04,637
- What's up? What's up? - Get it.

718
00:39:04,814 --> 00:39:06,748
Look at that, huh?

719
00:39:07,616 --> 00:39:10,141
- What's up, players? - What's up?

720
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:14,949
I've been up in here trying to get a motherfucking scholarship. Chilling.

721
00:39:15,124 --> 00:39:16,557
What's up with the clothes?

722
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,591
We were camping.

723
00:39:19,762 --> 00:39:21,195
- Camping? - Yeah.

724
00:39:21,363 --> 00:39:24,457
Is your lip okay, man?

725
00:39:24,633 --> 00:39:26,658
- You been crying? - Oh, my lip.

726
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,796
It's a cold sore.

727
00:39:28,971 --> 00:39:32,407
Never had one before, so I started to cry.

728
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:35,772
I think it's a lot worse than it looks, though.

729
00:39:35,945 --> 00:39:38,505
Cold sore? Does that mean fucking herpes?

730
00:39:39,014 --> 00:39:41,175
Yeah. Yes, it does.

731
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:44,183
Fucking sick, man. You know how many joints we've shared?

732
00:39:44,353 --> 00:39:47,083
I know. I'm a disgusting person.

733
00:39:47,256 --> 00:39:48,746
Herpes is for life, bro.

734
00:39:48,924 --> 00:39:52,382
I'm gonna try to definitely put some sort of medical ointment on it.

735
00:39:52,561 --> 00:39:55,189
Been taking Vicodin. Doesn't really take swelling down.

736
00:39:55,364 --> 00:39:57,093
It's from that time. I told you, man.

737
00:39:57,266 --> 00:40:00,633
You ate that lollipop out of that stripper's snatch. You wanted to do it.

738
00:40:00,803 --> 00:40:03,465
Out of her vagina. Remember what you did? What did you do?

739
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:06,904
You ate a box of Nerds out of her butthole.

740
00:40:07,076 --> 00:40:10,534
You fucking said you wouldn't tell. You sowed your own poison, man.

741
00:40:10,713 --> 00:40:13,375
Dudes, seriously, we're here for a reason. Just ask him.

742
00:40:13,549 --> 00:40:17,781
Chill. I'm boiling some eggs over here. We got a lot of time to hang out.

743
00:40:17,953 --> 00:40:19,682
- I'm making a fucking cake. - No shit.

744
00:40:19,855 --> 00:40:21,117
Can I have a piece of that?

745
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,554
- Don't ask for a piece. - I can't have a piece?

746
00:40:23,726 --> 00:40:25,216
No, you can't. This is private.

747
00:40:25,394 --> 00:40:27,157
Do you know what today is?

748
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:30,264
- Tuesday. - This is my cat's birthday today.

749
00:40:30,432 --> 00:40:33,595
I don't see a cat in here. I'm sorry. You let it out by accident?

750
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:35,737
No, because he died three months ago, okay?

751
00:40:35,905 --> 00:40:37,236
So now who's the funny guy?

752
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,564
Sorry.

753
00:40:38,741 --> 00:40:39,833
Today is his birthday...

754
00:40:40,009 --> 00:40:43,342
...and it is a tradition that on his birthday...

755
00:40:43,512 --> 00:40:46,777
...I get up extra early and make him his favorite kind of dessert.

756
00:40:47,216 --> 00:40:49,275
Don't worry, bro. Your cat's going to heaven.

757
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:51,146
Yeah, maybe. Maybe he went to heaven.

758
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,413
He was a little fucker. Could've gone to hell.

759
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:54,783
What are we talk...? Guys...

760
00:40:54,957 --> 00:40:56,481
Ask him. Just ask him, okay?

761
00:40:56,659 --> 00:40:58,752
Ask what? Just come straight. What's up?

762
00:40:58,928 --> 00:41:00,919
- Yeah, right. - Lay it on him.

763
00:41:01,096 --> 00:41:03,064
We need to know...

764
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,961
We need to know about your source.

765
00:41:05,134 --> 00:41:06,465
- Ted. - Ted Jones.

766
00:41:06,635 --> 00:41:10,298
See, Dale, here, is a protest servant.

767
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:11,939
I'm not. That's not what I am.

768
00:41:12,107 --> 00:41:15,235
He's not that, but he was outside Ted's house...

769
00:41:15,411 --> 00:41:20,405
Don't... Look, we don't want to bring you in to what we're in, okay?

770
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:23,347
You don't want any trouble. We don't wanna give you trouble.

771
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:25,919
It's probably best you don't know the whole story.

772
00:41:26,088 --> 00:41:28,955
- Don't think I can handle danger? - What are you talking about?

773
00:41:29,124 --> 00:41:31,024
- You can. - I totally can.

774
00:41:31,193 --> 00:41:32,956
And for you to come into my house...

775
00:41:33,128 --> 00:41:36,359
...and not tell secrets because you think you're saving me...

776
00:41:36,532 --> 00:41:39,228
...well, in reality, it just makes you look like a dumb-ass.

777
00:41:39,401 --> 00:41:40,629
Look at this. See this?

778
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,600
You see that? There's no hair under here, okay?

779
00:41:43,772 --> 00:41:45,239
What's the significance of that?

780
00:41:45,407 --> 00:41:48,205
It makes me aerodynamic when I fight. I can take danger.

781
00:41:48,377 --> 00:41:52,074
Okay, has anyone called asking about Saul or the Pineapple Express?

782
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:54,716
That's all we need to know.

783
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,344
Is it "uh-huh" or "uh-uh"?

784
00:41:59,521 --> 00:42:01,512
- It's "uh-uh." - There it is, man.

785
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:04,625
Cleared. Over.

786
00:42:04,793 --> 00:42:06,761
Everything's fine. I told you, bro.

787
00:42:06,929 --> 00:42:08,590
We had a wacky night in the woods...

788
00:42:08,764 --> 00:42:11,392
...but we both can put that behind us like adults.

789
00:42:11,567 --> 00:42:13,660
Now it's time to get super-duper high.

790
00:42:13,836 --> 00:42:15,303
Got that bong I got in Tel Aviv?

791
00:42:15,471 --> 00:42:16,802
"Bong Mitzvah." Hit it up.

792
00:42:16,972 --> 00:42:17,039
Yes.

793
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:18,666
Yes.

794
00:42:19,108 --> 00:42:20,370
There you go.

795
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:22,567
Why don't you follow his lead and chill out?

796
00:42:22,745 --> 00:42:24,838
I'm chill. I'm chill as a cucumber, man.

797
00:42:25,014 --> 00:42:27,574
- You don't seem chill. - More chill than you.

798
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,978
You're more chill than me?

799
00:42:29,151 --> 00:42:31,676
Look at what I'm wearing. Kimono. What are you wearing?

800
00:42:31,854 --> 00:42:33,754
- Suit. - Yeah. Exactly.

801
00:42:33,923 --> 00:42:37,120
I don't know what's up with you, but I don't know if I like you.

802
00:42:37,293 --> 00:42:39,420
Well, I don't know if I like you either, man.

803
00:42:39,595 --> 00:42:41,927
Well, that's your loss, because I'm a great friend.

804
00:42:42,097 --> 00:42:44,827
I'm gonna use the <i>telefono</i> to call my wife, okay?

805
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,160
- Give her a call. - I will.

806
00:42:46,335 --> 00:42:48,667
- Go ahead. - Don't pay attention to what I'm saying.

807
00:42:48,837 --> 00:42:50,361
Oh, I won't.

808
00:42:51,674 --> 00:42:52,732
Bullshit.

809
00:42:53,475 --> 00:42:55,272
No, no, no.

810
00:42:55,444 --> 00:42:56,911
- Liar. - What are you doing, man?

811
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:59,547
He's a liar. He's lying to us, man. He's lying to us.

812
00:42:59,715 --> 00:43:00,704
No, he's not.

813
00:43:00,883 --> 00:43:02,783
He knows my name. He's acting weird.

814
00:43:02,952 --> 00:43:04,886
We can't let him phone anyone, man.

815
00:43:05,054 --> 00:43:07,522
Freaking out. You're paranoid. Give him the phone.

816
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:08,918
I do not trust you, sir.

817
00:43:09,091 --> 00:43:10,854
- You're paranoid. - He's acting weird.

818
00:43:11,026 --> 00:43:13,017
Red, I'm sorry, bro.

819
00:43:13,195 --> 00:43:14,753
- Jesus! - Holy cock.

820
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,090
Fuck you!

821
00:43:16,265 --> 00:43:17,960
What are you doing, man? He's sorry.

822
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:19,395
Oh, Jesus.

823
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,499
Herpes!

824
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,807
I don't wanna have to do this.

825
00:43:25,975 --> 00:43:27,135
Red, you're crazy, man.

826
00:43:27,309 --> 00:43:29,277
You brought the devil into my house.

827
00:43:29,445 --> 00:43:31,174
- We're friends. - I know we are.

828
00:43:31,347 --> 00:43:33,406
- That's why it sucks. - Are you on meth again?

829
00:43:35,084 --> 00:43:37,575
Dale, he's hurting me!

830
00:43:37,753 --> 00:43:39,277
Toilet.

831
00:43:39,455 --> 00:43:40,945
Flush.

832
00:43:41,123 --> 00:43:44,354
What we do in this life echoes in eternity.

833
00:43:44,526 --> 00:43:46,858
True!

834
00:43:59,241 --> 00:44:02,972
He's going for the phone to call Ted!

835
00:44:03,612 --> 00:44:05,512
Stay out of here!

836
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,750
Red, don't do it!

837
00:44:12,788 --> 00:44:14,517
- Red! - You assholes.

838
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,248
You ruined my portable phone.

839
00:44:16,425 --> 00:44:18,620
- Teamwork. - Yes.

840
00:44:19,928 --> 00:44:22,021
You're gonna break the door. Gonna pay for it?

841
00:44:26,268 --> 00:44:27,326
Fuck.

842
00:44:27,503 --> 00:44:28,902
Phone.

843
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,435
- Let go! Let go! Let go! - What the hell...?

844
00:44:33,609 --> 00:44:36,134
I let go, now just get this goddamn door off of me!

845
00:44:36,311 --> 00:44:37,801
Tell us everything, now!

846
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,311
Said they were gonna kill me.

847
00:44:39,481 --> 00:44:41,472
What did you tell Ted?

848
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,584
He's crushing my balls. Crushing my balls.

849
00:44:43,752 --> 00:44:45,219
Smash them.

850
00:44:45,387 --> 00:44:46,411
Fuck!

851
00:44:46,588 --> 00:44:47,987
Time out. Time out.

852
00:44:48,157 --> 00:44:49,351
Time out. Time out.

853
00:44:49,525 --> 00:44:51,288
- Truce. - Time in. Fuck you.

854
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,257
- Stop! - Cheater!

855
00:44:53,429 --> 00:44:55,192
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Red!

856
00:44:55,364 --> 00:44:57,798
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Get...

857
00:44:59,034 --> 00:45:00,058
Fuck.

858
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,037
God...

859
00:45:03,205 --> 00:45:04,502
Fuck!

860
00:45:04,673 --> 00:45:06,664
- Take it, motherfucker! - Time out!

861
00:45:09,011 --> 00:45:10,603
Fuck!

862
00:45:14,049 --> 00:45:15,448
No! No, no, no!

863
00:45:15,617 --> 00:45:17,482
Where you going, huh?

864
00:45:17,653 --> 00:45:19,712
Where do you think you're going, Mr. Wiggles?

865
00:45:19,888 --> 00:45:22,652
- Come on. Get back here. - Saul, help me! Help me!

866
00:45:22,825 --> 00:45:24,224
He's punching my bum!

867
00:45:24,393 --> 00:45:27,157
I'm done with this. Let's talk. Let's try words.

868
00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:30,992
Use words! No! No! No!

869
00:45:34,203 --> 00:45:35,568
You okay, man?

870
00:45:35,737 --> 00:45:38,228
- I'll get you another bong. - It's my cat's birthday.

871
00:45:39,608 --> 00:45:41,303
Happy birthday.

872
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:42,834
- All right? - Thank you.

873
00:45:43,011 --> 00:45:45,309
I think there's a package in the mailbox.

874
00:45:45,481 --> 00:45:47,540
This ends now!

875
00:45:51,587 --> 00:45:53,054
Oh, shit.

876
00:45:53,222 --> 00:45:55,019
Was that too much?

877
00:45:56,892 --> 00:45:58,860
Can't get the edge.

878
00:45:59,394 --> 00:46:01,294
Wait. Got it. Got it.

879
00:46:01,463 --> 00:46:02,589
Hey, Dale.

880
00:46:02,764 --> 00:46:06,097
Think we're gonna have to kill him? I don't think I'm capable of murder.

881
00:46:06,268 --> 00:46:07,496
I don't think I am either.

882
00:46:07,669 --> 00:46:10,433
Maybe we could just convince him to kill himself.

883
00:46:10,606 --> 00:46:13,040
Or, just not say anything.

884
00:46:14,176 --> 00:46:17,407
We need to find out everything he knows, okay?

885
00:46:18,247 --> 00:46:19,839
Wake up.

886
00:46:20,382 --> 00:46:21,508
Hey, what's up, dudes?

887
00:46:21,683 --> 00:46:24,743
What's up? Tell us everything now.

888
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,944
Talk, Red.

889
00:46:26,121 --> 00:46:28,487
I'm gonna flex and bust out of here.

890
00:46:32,694 --> 00:46:33,888
Trapped.

891
00:46:34,062 --> 00:46:35,324
Not happening, Red.

892
00:46:35,497 --> 00:46:37,988
Okay. All right. Okay, I'll talk.

893
00:46:38,167 --> 00:46:42,661
Ted Jones, he knows you witnessed the murder. He found your roach.

894
00:46:42,838 --> 00:46:45,807
He sent two guys over here, Budlofsky and Matheson.

895
00:46:45,974 --> 00:46:48,306
Two real big son of a bitches.

896
00:46:48,477 --> 00:46:50,240
They're basically out to kill you guys.

897
00:46:50,412 --> 00:46:53,040
They're gonna kill me too, unless I turn y'all over.

898
00:46:53,215 --> 00:46:55,046
So you guys are basically fucked.

899
00:46:55,217 --> 00:46:57,811
How many cops does he have on his payroll? Tell us.

900
00:46:57,986 --> 00:47:00,784
- Well, there's the woman cop, Carol. - That's the lady cop.

901
00:47:00,956 --> 00:47:04,221
I don't know. He could have a bunch. This dude is super well-connected.

902
00:47:04,393 --> 00:47:07,362
And he has a really awesome hideout too. It's pretty badass.

903
00:47:07,529 --> 00:47:09,087
- Oh, shit. - What else?

904
00:47:09,264 --> 00:47:11,459
He's at a war right now with the Asians.

905
00:47:11,633 --> 00:47:13,100
They're in a drug war right now.

906
00:47:13,268 --> 00:47:15,600
Asians? What Asians? Indians are technically Asian.

907
00:47:15,771 --> 00:47:17,363
- It's true. - What Asians?

908
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:21,339
I don't know. What? Chinese? Or Korean or...

909
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:22,534
Vietcong?

910
00:47:22,711 --> 00:47:25,373
Yeah, little... Just little Asian people.

911
00:47:25,547 --> 00:47:31,144
Like, the Asians with the guns and the drugs, and not his friends.

912
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,344
- Ding-dong. - Hey, Red!

913
00:47:32,521 --> 00:47:33,852
- Oh, shit. - Oh, they're here.

914
00:47:34,022 --> 00:47:35,387
They're here to kill me.

915
00:47:35,557 --> 00:47:39,425
Okay, I know I sold y'all out. I've been a son of a bitch and a shitty friend.

916
00:47:39,595 --> 00:47:41,995
Saul, I'm talking to you. Dale, you're a new friend.

917
00:47:42,164 --> 00:47:44,359
I can make it up. I forgot, "bro's before ho's."

918
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:47,001
Just go out the back porch. I won't say anything.

919
00:47:47,169 --> 00:47:48,534
- I'll cover for you. - Thanks.

920
00:47:48,704 --> 00:47:50,467
No sweat.

921
00:47:54,943 --> 00:47:56,843
It was Dale Denton. Dale Denton and Saul.

922
00:47:57,012 --> 00:48:00,175
They're on the back porch. You can catch them if you hurry. Go.

923
00:48:02,851 --> 00:48:04,443
Hey. In here.

924
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,611
I've gotta get to a phone. Come on.

925
00:48:06,788 --> 00:48:08,380
- We should hide. - Why?

926
00:48:08,557 --> 00:48:10,491
If Red tells Ted's guys about my name...

927
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:12,422
...then they'll go to my apartment.

928
00:48:12,594 --> 00:48:16,291
There, I have Angie's name. They'll put that together, find her. Let's go.

929
00:48:16,465 --> 00:48:17,955
No. I think we should stay.

930
00:48:18,133 --> 00:48:20,465
- Why? - I'm in the dumpster already.

931
00:48:20,636 --> 00:48:23,696
Well, then, get out. Come on, you're already dirty.

932
00:48:25,674 --> 00:48:28,165
- They're gone. - <i>Well, find out what he knows.</i>

933
00:48:28,343 --> 00:48:29,833
Red, it's your last chance, man.

934
00:48:30,012 --> 00:48:31,809
You gonna give us something we can use?

935
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:35,381
Matheson, you gotta be kidding me. I mean, what more do you want?

936
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,643
I told you that the guy's name is Dale Denton.

937
00:48:37,819 --> 00:48:39,446
He's obviously working with Saul.

938
00:48:39,621 --> 00:48:41,589
They came in here, busted my house to shit.

939
00:48:41,757 --> 00:48:43,418
They kicked the hell out of me...

940
00:48:43,592 --> 00:48:45,787
...duct-taped me to my grandfather's wheelchair.

941
00:48:45,961 --> 00:48:48,429
What more do you want? Want me to read your horoscope?

942
00:48:48,597 --> 00:48:52,294
- You hear that, Ted? - Ask if either of them were Asian.

943
00:48:52,467 --> 00:48:54,958
- What skin color were they? - They were white people.

944
00:48:55,137 --> 00:48:57,196
Denton might've been a Jew. I don't know.

945
00:48:57,372 --> 00:48:59,533
I don't judge people based on things like that.

946
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:02,074
Obviously. We're friends.

947
00:49:02,244 --> 00:49:03,541
<i>Ted, you hear him?</i>

948
00:49:03,712 --> 00:49:07,614
Dale Denton: not Asian. All right. Kill Red.

949
00:49:07,783 --> 00:49:11,310
Listen, I would appreciate it if both y'all would take your shoes off.

950
00:49:11,486 --> 00:49:13,977
This is brand-new carpet. You're tracking mud in here.

951
00:49:14,156 --> 00:49:15,817
Matheson, you got British Knights on.

952
00:49:15,991 --> 00:49:17,982
I ain't seen anybody wear them since 1987.

953
00:49:19,661 --> 00:49:21,424
What the hell are you doing?

954
00:49:21,596 --> 00:49:23,325
Ted told me to kill him.

955
00:49:23,498 --> 00:49:26,296
Well, how about a little fucking discretion here?

956
00:49:26,468 --> 00:49:28,368
See? See? See, right there. You see that?

957
00:49:28,537 --> 00:49:29,663
- You catch it? - See what?

958
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:32,898
You used to not give a fuck about discretion.

959
00:49:33,075 --> 00:49:36,101
I seen you pull somebody's jawbone off. I seen it.

960
00:49:36,945 --> 00:49:38,378
You was ruthless.

961
00:49:38,547 --> 00:49:40,913
You was ruthless, man.

962
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:44,143
What the fuck, man? You shot me in my stomach.

963
00:49:44,853 --> 00:49:46,548
I'm gonna die now probably.

964
00:49:46,722 --> 00:49:50,123
I had you all over here for dinner. Fish tacos.

965
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:51,816
This how you do me?

966
00:49:55,397 --> 00:49:57,228
So, what did Budlofsky and Matheson say?

967
00:49:57,399 --> 00:49:59,026
I don't know.

968
00:50:00,102 --> 00:50:02,434
There's this guy, Saul...

969
00:50:03,004 --> 00:50:05,939
...something, selling weed who works with some guy, Dale Denton.

970
00:50:06,108 --> 00:50:07,473
That's all he got out of him.

971
00:50:07,642 --> 00:50:11,078
Do you think he has anything to do with the guy that we shot?

972
00:50:11,246 --> 00:50:13,111
Well, did he say anything else?

973
00:50:13,281 --> 00:50:16,546
Saul mentioned something about "going to the casino."

974
00:50:16,718 --> 00:50:18,845
- Weird. - "Going to the casino"?

975
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,113
The Asians own the casino, Ted.

976
00:50:21,289 --> 00:50:24,725
- I need another beer. - He's gotta be working for them.

977
00:50:25,227 --> 00:50:28,628
Maybe after we popped that guy, they hired this outside guy, Dale...

978
00:50:28,797 --> 00:50:30,958
What's his name? Denton? - to finish the job.

979
00:50:31,433 --> 00:50:32,457
<i>Maybe.</i>

980
00:50:32,634 --> 00:50:35,762
<i>Maybe. Well, I'll be back in an hour.</i>

981
00:50:35,937 --> 00:50:39,429
<i>I'll have everything there is to know</i> <i>about this Dale Denton guy.</i>

982
00:50:39,608 --> 00:50:43,009
<i>Who he's screwing,</i> <i>who's his mother, everything.</i>

983
00:50:43,245 --> 00:50:44,803
I have to take a shit.

984
00:50:46,982 --> 00:50:48,813
Wait. Where are we going?

985
00:50:48,984 --> 00:50:53,284
I gotta... I gotta get to Angie's. I have to make sure she's okay.

986
00:50:53,455 --> 00:50:55,923
What about my <i>bubbe?</i> Don't think they'll go after her.

987
00:50:56,091 --> 00:50:58,651
I mean, she has a different last name.

988
00:50:58,827 --> 00:51:00,158
Belogus.

989
00:51:00,328 --> 00:51:03,661
I don't know. We should get out of the middle of the road. Come on.

990
00:51:19,815 --> 00:51:21,646
You guys can wait as long as you want...

991
00:51:21,817 --> 00:51:25,548
...but one minute from right now, I'm gonna eat some food.

992
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,621
And you can call it rude. You can call it whatever you want.

993
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:32,191
You can be polite with your clean plates, but I'm gonna be eating food.

994
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,384
Dad, he'll be here.

995
00:51:33,562 --> 00:51:36,622
I'm going in the other room and eat it, check my e-mail. I'm done.

996
00:51:36,798 --> 00:51:39,790
Honey, we're at the table. No one's going to leave the table.

997
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:45,329
- Okay. This is it. - All right. Let's do this.

998
00:51:45,507 --> 00:51:47,099
No, no, no. I'm going alone.

999
00:51:47,275 --> 00:51:49,334
- No. - Yeah. Yeah.

1000
00:51:49,511 --> 00:51:52,378
- I wanna meet Angie. - You'll meet her later, man. Look.

1001
00:51:52,547 --> 00:51:55,107
Look, I need you to stay out here. Keep guard, okay?

1002
00:51:55,283 --> 00:51:57,046
- It's important. Watch my back. - Okay.

1003
00:51:57,219 --> 00:51:59,346
- Thanks. - All right. Just be yourself.

1004
00:51:59,521 --> 00:52:01,216
I'll keep guard.

1005
00:52:01,723 --> 00:52:03,315
Hey.

1006
00:52:04,726 --> 00:52:06,284
Shit.

1007
00:52:06,461 --> 00:52:08,019
Oh, no.

1008
00:52:08,196 --> 00:52:09,220
Hey, Dale.

1009
00:52:09,397 --> 00:52:12,332
- Hello, Dale. - Hey.

1010
00:52:12,501 --> 00:52:13,525
Dinner.

1011
00:52:14,336 --> 00:52:18,602
This is the dinner you invited me to. That was tonight. That's why I'm here.

1012
00:52:18,773 --> 00:52:20,070
Sit. Please.

1013
00:52:20,242 --> 00:52:22,540
Of course. Hi.

1014
00:52:22,711 --> 00:52:24,303
- Hi. - Shannon.

1015
00:52:24,479 --> 00:52:26,106
- Intros. - Great to meet you.

1016
00:52:26,281 --> 00:52:29,011
- Robert, if I'm not mistaken. - Sit down, so we can eat.

1017
00:52:29,184 --> 00:52:31,618
- Hi, Dale. - Hey. Okay.

1018
00:52:31,786 --> 00:52:33,276
- What happened to you? - Nothing.

1019
00:52:33,455 --> 00:52:35,320
I'm supposed to be here right now.

1020
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:36,616
So I'm here.

1021
00:52:36,791 --> 00:52:39,954
- You're all dirty and bleeding. - No, I'm not. I'm here for dinner.

1022
00:52:40,128 --> 00:52:43,962
- You have scratches on your forehead. - Dude, you smell like shit.

1023
00:52:44,132 --> 00:52:46,794
- Dale, what happened to you? - I was in the woods.

1024
00:52:46,968 --> 00:52:50,131
- In the woods? - Yeah. Isn't that weird? I was...

1025
00:52:50,305 --> 00:52:52,205
- I was in the woods. - What were you doing?

1026
00:52:52,374 --> 00:52:54,706
I bird-watch. I don't.

1027
00:52:54,876 --> 00:52:57,777
No, I don't. Look, I'm gonna come clean.

1028
00:52:58,947 --> 00:53:01,609
I witnessed a murder, okay?

1029
00:53:01,783 --> 00:53:03,683
I saw someone murder someone else...

1030
00:53:03,852 --> 00:53:06,377
...and I think they've been following me.

1031
00:53:06,555 --> 00:53:08,819
There's a good chance they went to my apartment...

1032
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,685
...where Angie has a lot of things.

1033
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:13,828
Her yearbooks, report cards, her cell number is written...

1034
00:53:13,995 --> 00:53:15,292
...and it's on my fridge.

1035
00:53:15,463 --> 00:53:18,091
So they could then find this house. They could come here.

1036
00:53:18,266 --> 00:53:19,961
We should call the police right away.

1037
00:53:20,135 --> 00:53:22,228
We can't. The police were the murderers.

1038
00:53:22,404 --> 00:53:24,929
We can't call the police. They were the murderers.

1039
00:53:25,106 --> 00:53:27,768
Angie, I swear to God, you do something or I'm gonna...

1040
00:53:27,943 --> 00:53:30,002
- So fucked up. - No. Don't let him "gonna."

1041
00:53:30,178 --> 00:53:33,705
No, don't wanna. Look, we gotta get the F out of here.

1042
00:53:33,882 --> 00:53:36,510
Let's go. We need to begin to prematurely evacuate.

1043
00:53:36,685 --> 00:53:39,176
- Are you high? - What? No. I'm not high. Why...?

1044
00:53:39,354 --> 00:53:41,185
You are high as a fucking kite.

1045
00:53:41,356 --> 00:53:42,823
I'm not high. Let's go.

1046
00:53:42,991 --> 00:53:45,084
We're not going. I'm coming back in a minute.

1047
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,490
You know what I'm coming back with? With a gun.

1048
00:53:47,662 --> 00:53:49,892
You better be out. I'm not fucking with you.

1049
00:53:50,065 --> 00:53:52,056
Your gun? His gun?

1050
00:53:52,233 --> 00:53:54,701
Why do you...? Don't get a gun. Why would he bear arms?

1051
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:58,862
No, we need to go. Everyone, I'm leading the parade.

1052
00:54:14,889 --> 00:54:16,652
- This is so exciting. - <i>Okay, okay.</i>

1053
00:54:16,825 --> 00:54:18,952
Is this where you're parked? Let's sally forth.

1054
00:54:19,127 --> 00:54:20,526
Who is after you, after Angie?

1055
00:54:20,695 --> 00:54:24,096
They're drug dealers. I have reason to believe that they're drug dealers.

1056
00:54:24,265 --> 00:54:26,733
What are you talking about? You're out of your mind.

1057
00:54:26,901 --> 00:54:29,335
- I know it sounds crazy. - Hide.

1058
00:54:29,504 --> 00:54:32,905
Dale! Dale! Dale! It's happening. I was eating a Fruit Roll...

1059
00:54:33,108 --> 00:54:34,370
- Why'd you do that? - God!

1060
00:54:34,542 --> 00:54:36,271
- Get it! - Jesus! Okay! Just stop!

1061
00:54:36,444 --> 00:54:39,709
- Angie, what did you do? - He's one of the drug dealers!

1062
00:54:39,881 --> 00:54:42,008
- He's my pot dealer. - He's your pot dealer?

1063
00:54:42,183 --> 00:54:43,309
- I got it. - Get it.

1064
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,220
- Gross. Are you okay? - Dale, who is this?

1065
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:51,382
- He's my... Oh, shit. Get down. - Dad!

1066
00:54:56,097 --> 00:54:57,359
What was that?

1067
00:54:57,532 --> 00:54:59,591
That was a gunshot.

1068
00:55:03,605 --> 00:55:05,505
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

1069
00:55:05,674 --> 00:55:07,608
- He's with me. - I'm the good drug dealer.

1070
00:55:07,776 --> 00:55:10,176
- Put the gun down! - Put down the gun.

1071
00:55:10,345 --> 00:55:12,074
You assholes do exactly what I say...

1072
00:55:12,247 --> 00:55:15,080
...or I will take you outside and fuck you in the street.

1073
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:16,979
- No, don't. - Don't fuck us anywhere.

1074
00:55:28,463 --> 00:55:30,431
Anybody out there?

1075
00:55:33,435 --> 00:55:35,869
Fucking hide-and-seek.

1076
00:55:36,037 --> 00:55:37,664
Say, now.

1077
00:55:40,175 --> 00:55:42,541
Hey, the food's still warm.

1078
00:55:45,613 --> 00:55:46,807
Love it.

1079
00:55:46,981 --> 00:55:48,972
Come on, Saul. Come on. Come on. Come on.

1080
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:51,618
Yes. We made it. We're all safe, guys. We made it.

1081
00:55:51,786 --> 00:55:53,117
- What are you doing? - Get out.

1082
00:55:53,288 --> 00:55:56,018
Get out of my car. I can't believe you think it's an option.

1083
00:55:56,191 --> 00:55:58,318
Okay. Okay. That makes sense. It makes sense.

1084
00:55:58,493 --> 00:56:00,586
Come on, let's go. It makes sense. He's right.

1085
00:56:00,762 --> 00:56:04,198
- Stay away from my family. Period. - So where do we go? What do we do?

1086
00:56:04,365 --> 00:56:06,697
Go to the Days Inn downtown, okay?

1087
00:56:06,868 --> 00:56:08,995
Use a fake name.

1088
00:56:09,504 --> 00:56:11,495
Garagely. I'll contact you.

1089
00:56:11,673 --> 00:56:14,642
I don't know who these people are, what they're capable of...

1090
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:17,505
...but I will keep you guys safe, I promise that.

1091
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:18,976
Fuck off, loser.

1092
00:56:20,949 --> 00:56:24,544
Angie, you're a fucking idiot. I say that with love.

1093
00:56:25,987 --> 00:56:27,011
So get this:

1094
00:56:27,188 --> 00:56:28,780
We triangulated the cells.

1095
00:56:28,957 --> 00:56:32,518
They smashed one, threw the other in the woods to try to distract us.

1096
00:56:32,694 --> 00:56:34,719
It took an hour for Jared to find it.

1097
00:56:34,896 --> 00:56:37,592
And then he said that he found Denton's car...

1098
00:56:37,766 --> 00:56:40,132
...filled with all these strange disguises.

1099
00:56:40,301 --> 00:56:43,566
A powdered wig, a sombrero, leotards.

1100
00:56:43,738 --> 00:56:45,569
I mean, what the fuck does that mean?

1101
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:48,231
Why don't I just call the Asians and talk to Cheung?

1102
00:56:48,409 --> 00:56:50,707
Why beat around the bush, you know?

1103
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:03,220
Hello?

1104
00:57:03,424 --> 00:57:04,448
<i>Cheung, it's Ted.</i>

1105
00:57:04,626 --> 00:57:06,025
Record this conversation.

1106
00:57:06,628 --> 00:57:10,394
Ted, what a surprise. What can I do for you?

1107
00:57:10,565 --> 00:57:14,558
Well, Cheung, my friend, let me tell you.

1108
00:57:14,736 --> 00:57:18,638
You know, we both know that you sent one of your very skilled...

1109
00:57:18,807 --> 00:57:22,800
<i>... hit men over here last night,</i> <i>and I and my colleague...</i>

1110
00:57:22,977 --> 00:57:26,140
...made a little decoration on our window. Should have seen it.

1111
00:57:26,314 --> 00:57:29,681
<i>We painted the wall with his brain.</i> <i>Painted it.</i>

1112
00:57:29,851 --> 00:57:33,514
And now this Dale Denton guy? You serious?

1113
00:57:33,688 --> 00:57:37,283
Just stop it, okay? Stop it or you're asking for war. Do you want a war?

1114
00:57:37,692 --> 00:57:38,716
Bring it on.

1115
00:57:38,893 --> 00:57:41,327
<i>You listen to me, you motherfucker!</i>

1116
00:57:41,496 --> 00:57:43,964
It is on! We're coming at you with everything we got!

1117
00:57:44,132 --> 00:57:46,657
It's on, so you better get your head out of your ass...

1118
00:57:46,835 --> 00:57:48,496
...and be ready for everything!

1119
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:50,535
You are fucking dead!

1120
00:57:51,673 --> 00:57:52,799
You are so dumb.

1121
00:57:52,974 --> 00:57:56,466
Do you have any idea how weak you just made us look?

1122
00:57:57,946 --> 00:58:01,006
Goddamn it!

1123
00:58:01,349 --> 00:58:02,680
Totally sweet.

1124
00:58:03,084 --> 00:58:05,382
Ted Jones is slipping.

1125
00:58:05,553 --> 00:58:09,182
We shall strike now with full force.

1126
00:58:10,358 --> 00:58:13,088
Your brother's death will not be in vain.

1127
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:19,259
I gotta say, I've had, like, a lot of weed dealers in my day.

1128
00:58:19,434 --> 00:58:22,028
You're the coolest I've ever had. They were all dicks.

1129
00:58:22,203 --> 00:58:24,694
- Really? Thanks, man. - No problem.

1130
00:58:24,873 --> 00:58:27,307
I really appreciate it. That means a lot to me.

1131
00:58:27,475 --> 00:58:31,275
It's, like, you're the first guy that I ever sold to that I became friends with.

1132
00:58:31,446 --> 00:58:35,348
They say, like, "Don't dip the pen in company ink."

1133
00:58:35,516 --> 00:58:38,508
I'm totally glad I dipped in your ink, bro.

1134
00:58:39,754 --> 00:58:41,244
Yeah.

1135
00:58:43,892 --> 00:58:46,520
We should get out of town. That's probably our next move.

1136
00:58:46,694 --> 00:58:48,355
Just get on a bus and leave, right?

1137
00:58:49,264 --> 00:58:50,561
Get bus tickets.

1138
00:58:50,732 --> 00:58:54,168
Go to the next town. Contact some police.

1139
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:56,599
You know what I was saying? Like, I'm totally...

1140
00:58:56,771 --> 00:58:58,705
You're glad you dipped your pen in my ink.

1141
00:58:58,873 --> 00:59:01,068
But we should get bus tickets and leave, right?

1142
00:59:01,242 --> 00:59:02,436
What?

1143
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:05,738
Get on the bus? Leave? Buy bus tickets?

1144
00:59:05,914 --> 00:59:09,247
I only have, like, 50 bucks. I don't think that'll even buy one ticket.

1145
00:59:09,817 --> 00:59:11,114
What about your sack?

1146
00:59:11,286 --> 00:59:14,153
Oh, man, it's fucking killing me. I feel like I popped one.

1147
00:59:15,356 --> 00:59:18,291
No. That's unfortunate, but that's not what I'm talking about.

1148
00:59:18,459 --> 00:59:19,926
I mean, like, the sack of weed.

1149
00:59:20,094 --> 00:59:22,153
Couldn't we just, like, sell some weed...

1150
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:23,991
...get some cash and buy bus tickets?

1151
00:59:24,165 --> 00:59:28,192
- Of course, man. That's what I do. - That's what you do. Fucking A.

1152
00:59:28,369 --> 00:59:29,103
Okay, so you're gonna buy tickets for Saturday's game, right?

1153
00:59:29,103 --> 00:59:31,162
Okay, so you're gonna buy tickets for Saturday's game, right?

1154
00:59:31,339 --> 00:59:32,931
These guys are amazing.

1155
00:59:33,441 --> 00:59:34,806
What the fuck do you want?

1156
00:59:34,976 --> 00:59:37,137
You guys wanna buy some chronic?

1157
00:59:43,952 --> 00:59:45,419
What's this stuff called again?

1158
00:59:45,586 --> 00:59:47,611
Pineapple Express. They said it eight times.

1159
00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:50,986
- Yeah, but don't call it that. - Yeah, that's not what it's called.

1160
00:59:51,159 --> 00:59:54,026
- Call it Banana Boat. - Make sure you leave it at weed too.

1161
00:59:54,195 --> 00:59:57,130
This can be a gateway drug. Don't wanna move on to other things.

1162
00:59:57,298 --> 00:59:59,766
- Cocaine. Don't do that. - We don't fuck around.

1163
00:59:59,934 --> 01:00:03,995
- Don't worry. Don't tell us what to do. - Inhale it, Chachi. Inhale it.

1164
01:00:04,172 --> 01:00:05,571
Who the fuck's Chachi?

1165
01:00:23,491 --> 01:00:25,550
- How much money you guys got? - Come on.

1166
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:28,093
You each get as much as you can grab with one hand.

1167
01:00:28,262 --> 01:00:30,560
Go easy. That's a big handful, guys. Come on.

1168
01:00:30,732 --> 01:00:34,395
- Keep it on the down-low. - Don't tell anybody where you got it.

1169
01:00:34,569 --> 01:00:38,733
You got it from Saul... I mean, you got it from Santiago and Dunbar.

1170
01:00:38,906 --> 01:00:41,739
- Go. Come on. - Go, go. Vamoose!

1171
01:00:43,811 --> 01:00:44,903
You fucking did it, man.

1172
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:47,741
You are a good salesman. You got it in you, man.

1173
01:00:47,915 --> 01:00:50,349
I'm about to go get some celebratory Slushees.

1174
01:00:50,518 --> 01:00:52,008
Get some burritos or something.

1175
01:00:52,186 --> 01:00:54,154
Something to drink too. Something good.

1176
01:00:54,322 --> 01:00:56,756
See you, man. Nice.

1177
01:01:02,964 --> 01:01:06,365
Don't move. Don't you move. This shit hurts.

1178
01:01:06,534 --> 01:01:08,126
Don't move. What's in your hand?

1179
01:01:08,302 --> 01:01:10,065
It's weed. It's a joint. It's a roach.

1180
01:01:10,238 --> 01:01:11,933
- Right here. - I was just smoking...

1181
01:01:12,106 --> 01:01:14,631
I thought it was decriminalized, to be honest with you.

1182
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:19,075
I have horrible anorexia, and it helps my appetite. I'm so sorry.

1183
01:01:19,247 --> 01:01:24,014
Look, selling narcotics to my students is not decriminalized.

1184
01:01:24,185 --> 01:01:27,177
- Okay. I understand. - I'm the liaison officer for this school.

1185
01:01:27,355 --> 01:01:30,449
And guess what? I just saw three students walking from back here...

1186
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:33,958
...with their eyes as red as the devil's dick. You're busted.

1187
01:01:40,168 --> 01:01:42,033
- On the hood. On the hood. - Okay, okay.

1188
01:01:42,203 --> 01:01:43,932
I'm on the hood. Come on.

1189
01:01:44,105 --> 01:01:46,869
- Stand still. Stand still. - I'm still. I'm sorry.

1190
01:01:47,041 --> 01:01:50,772
You better hope it's clean. Better hope ain't shit on this record.

1191
01:01:50,945 --> 01:01:53,778
I'm gonna put my foot up in your ass.

1192
01:01:57,452 --> 01:01:59,920
Oh, big sexy with glasses.

1193
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:05,682
This is Officer Barbara. Requesting an update on fugitive Dale Denton.

1194
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:10,388
I repeat, requesting update on Dale Denton. I have the fugitive in custody.

1195
01:02:10,565 --> 01:02:12,590
425, 425, what's your location?

1196
01:02:14,135 --> 01:02:15,397
You going down.

1197
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:17,663
What? What do you mean...? Why am I going down?

1198
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:20,103
What did that thing tell you? What are you doing?

1199
01:02:20,274 --> 01:02:22,504
What did I tell you? What did I tell you?

1200
01:02:22,677 --> 01:02:25,168
I wasn't doing things. Why do you hate me so much?

1201
01:02:25,346 --> 01:02:27,780
Hit-and-run, Mr. Denton. Hit-and-run.

1202
01:02:27,949 --> 01:02:29,416
Two parked cars, two nights ago.

1203
01:02:29,584 --> 01:02:31,643
One of them was actually a police cruiser.

1204
01:02:31,819 --> 01:02:34,686
You gotta be the dumbest motherfucker in captivity.

1205
01:02:34,856 --> 01:02:37,723
It's the lady cop. They got Dale. Oh, shit.

1206
01:02:37,892 --> 01:02:39,792
So you're telling me you saw Ted Jones...

1207
01:02:39,961 --> 01:02:41,724
...and a police officer shoot somebody?

1208
01:02:41,896 --> 01:02:43,386
- Exactly. - And you saw it?

1209
01:02:43,564 --> 01:02:45,555
- Yes, do you believe me? - Give me a minute.

1210
01:02:45,733 --> 01:02:48,566
- It was a woman or a man? - It was a policewoman. A woman.

1211
01:02:48,736 --> 01:02:53,639
- I think I know who that bitch was. - Yes. I will identify that bitch.

1212
01:02:55,576 --> 01:02:58,010
Thank you so much for believing me, ma'am. Thank you.

1213
01:02:58,179 --> 01:03:00,238
I'll tell you, I'll get to the bottom of it.

1214
01:03:00,414 --> 01:03:02,678
I'll take this badge off, get to the bottom of it.

1215
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:05,011
I don't work for the law. The law works for me.

1216
01:03:05,186 --> 01:03:07,279
I been smelling something in this department.

1217
01:03:07,455 --> 01:03:08,820
Keep your eyes on the road.

1218
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:11,220
- Gonna get to the bottom of this shit. - Stop!

1219
01:03:12,426 --> 01:03:13,791
Son of a bitch!

1220
01:03:13,961 --> 01:03:17,829
Oh, no. What the hell was that? What is that?

1221
01:03:23,804 --> 01:03:27,570
No, no, no.

1222
01:03:27,742 --> 01:03:30,734
- No. What are you doing? - I'm saving you, amigo!

1223
01:03:32,113 --> 01:03:34,172
Freeze, goddamn it! Don't even think about it!

1224
01:03:34,348 --> 01:03:36,908
This is an old-fashioned escape mission, buddy.

1225
01:03:37,084 --> 01:03:38,881
Stop this car!

1226
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:44,981
- What the fuck are you doing? - Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1227
01:03:45,159 --> 01:03:46,592
Oh, shit!

1228
01:03:49,197 --> 01:03:52,166
Oh, shit! It's the lady cop! That's the murderer! Go!

1229
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:53,925
- That's the lady cop. - Who's that?

1230
01:03:54,101 --> 01:03:57,127
I don't know. They're shooting!

1231
01:04:03,077 --> 01:04:05,045
Oh, my God, they're shooting!

1232
01:04:05,213 --> 01:04:06,510
Fuck.

1233
01:04:11,485 --> 01:04:13,009
Dude!

1234
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:17,348
I can't see! The Slushee!

1235
01:04:17,525 --> 01:04:19,686
- Turn on the wipers! - It's not working!

1236
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,521
Well, kick out the window!

1237
01:04:21,696 --> 01:04:24,460
- How do you drive with one foot? - I don't know!

1238
01:04:26,467 --> 01:04:28,332
Fuck! I think I pulled my groin!

1239
01:04:31,739 --> 01:04:33,036
Get your foot out of there.

1240
01:04:33,774 --> 01:04:35,867
She's gaining on us. She's behind us.

1241
01:04:36,043 --> 01:04:37,101
Her car's better.

1242
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:39,678
- Get your leg out of there. Seriously. - I can't.

1243
01:04:39,847 --> 01:04:42,748
Put it into maximum overdrive!

1244
01:04:45,219 --> 01:04:47,312
Oh, no, no, no!

1245
01:04:49,357 --> 01:04:50,654
Oh, shit!

1246
01:04:50,825 --> 01:04:52,520
Get it out!

1247
01:04:54,962 --> 01:04:56,554
I can't see!

1248
01:05:01,936 --> 01:05:06,339
Danger! Danger! Trees! Tree, tree! Squirrel!

1249
01:05:09,243 --> 01:05:10,835
Hey, I can see through my leg hole.

1250
01:05:11,012 --> 01:05:12,741
Nice! Look out! Tree, tree, tree!

1251
01:05:15,483 --> 01:05:17,383
You did it, man.

1252
01:05:18,686 --> 01:05:20,176
All right! Look out!

1253
01:05:20,354 --> 01:05:22,413
Oh, shit!

1254
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:25,024
Turn around! Turn around!

1255
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:35,098
I'm scared, Saul. I'm scared.

1256
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:37,601
- Don't worry. I'm handling this. - Do something.

1257
01:05:37,772 --> 01:05:40,036
All right, hold on. I got an idea.

1258
01:05:43,544 --> 01:05:46,877
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1259
01:05:47,782 --> 01:05:49,272
Sorry!

1260
01:05:50,584 --> 01:05:52,176
What the fuck was that?

1261
01:05:52,353 --> 01:05:54,583
Fuck. I'm sorry. I thought she'd just go past.

1262
01:05:54,755 --> 01:05:56,655
- Why? - I don't know.

1263
01:06:13,641 --> 01:06:15,131
Oh, my.

1264
01:06:19,647 --> 01:06:22,047
Yes! Yes! We made it! All right, man.

1265
01:06:22,216 --> 01:06:24,912
- Let's get the fuck out of here. - No. What are you doing?

1266
01:06:25,086 --> 01:06:27,850
You forgot me, you idiot! Come back!

1267
01:06:28,022 --> 01:06:30,889
Come back! Saul!

1268
01:06:31,058 --> 01:06:32,423
- Sorry, man. - Thank you.

1269
01:06:32,593 --> 01:06:36,529
- Let's go. - Wait. Get the handcuff keys, you idiot.

1270
01:06:38,632 --> 01:06:41,897
As soon as we kill those sacks of shit tonight, Ted...

1271
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:43,798
...l'm moving on.

1272
01:06:48,075 --> 01:06:49,667
Okay.

1273
01:06:49,844 --> 01:06:51,402
All right.

1274
01:06:52,213 --> 01:06:55,671
And I promise you you're gonna be taken care of.

1275
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:57,112
As sure as shit you will.

1276
01:06:57,284 --> 01:06:59,081
For now, this is what we're gonna do.

1277
01:06:59,253 --> 01:07:02,745
We're gonna go to the farm tonight, we're gonna move tonight's shipment.

1278
01:07:02,923 --> 01:07:05,517
Then tomorrow morning, we're gonna hunt these guys down.

1279
01:07:05,693 --> 01:07:08,184
Dale, Saul, the Asians. Every last one of them.

1280
01:07:08,362 --> 01:07:10,489
We're gonna fucking kill them all.

1281
01:07:10,998 --> 01:07:12,727
So smile.

1282
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,458
Shut up.

1283
01:07:16,904 --> 01:07:21,238
Say something in Spanish. Go ahead. I dare you. Go ahead.

1284
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:24,407
All right. Are you using protection?

1285
01:07:24,578 --> 01:07:25,636
- <i>Days Inn.</i> - Yes.

1286
01:07:25,813 --> 01:07:27,678
May I have the Garagely room, please?

1287
01:07:28,516 --> 01:07:30,450
- Hello? - <i>Hello, is Angie there?</i>

1288
01:07:30,618 --> 01:07:32,449
- Dale. - <i>Angie?</i>

1289
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:35,316
- My God, are you okay? - <i>I'm good. I'm fine. I'm great.</i>

1290
01:07:35,489 --> 01:07:36,820
- <i>Are you okay?</i> - Yes, I'm fine.

1291
01:07:36,991 --> 01:07:38,583
<i>Okay, good. I came up with a plan.</i>

1292
01:07:38,759 --> 01:07:40,920
It might sound weird at first, but just listen.

1293
01:07:41,095 --> 01:07:43,962
Dale. You know what? Drug dealers... Let me tell you something.

1294
01:07:44,131 --> 01:07:49,034
Drug dealers are trying to kill me. And you. And my family.

1295
01:07:49,203 --> 01:07:52,104
<i>I can't believe I'm in this situation</i> <i>right now because of you...</i>

1296
01:07:52,273 --> 01:07:55,140
...and your addiction to marijuana. I cannot believe I'm here.

1297
01:07:55,309 --> 01:07:56,833
<i>I can't be addicted to marijuana.</i>

1298
01:07:57,011 --> 01:08:00,174
A, I use a bong. It filters out the addictive shit. Seriously.

1299
01:08:00,347 --> 01:08:03,214
<i>B, what does that have to do with</i> <i>anything? I witnessed murder.</i>

1300
01:08:03,384 --> 01:08:04,681
And now I'm dealing with it.

1301
01:08:04,852 --> 01:08:07,343
This, that's happening between us, this is normal.

1302
01:08:07,521 --> 01:08:10,012
This happens to every couple dating for three months.

1303
01:08:10,191 --> 01:08:11,681
- <i>We have to work through it.</i> - No.

1304
01:08:11,859 --> 01:08:13,326
This doesn't happen to anyone.

1305
01:08:13,494 --> 01:08:15,962
I should not be in this situation, so fuck you.

1306
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,427
<i>You know what? It's over.</i>

1307
01:08:17,598 --> 01:08:20,123
Good. Fine. Whatever. It's over.

1308
01:08:20,301 --> 01:08:23,634
Congratulations. Had to happen sometime, right? Why not now?

1309
01:08:23,804 --> 01:08:25,135
What the fuck does that mean?

1310
01:08:25,306 --> 01:08:27,934
<i>It means that you are gonna go</i> <i>to college next year.</i>

1311
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:30,201
<i>You'll get into</i> <i>Godspeed You! Black Emperor...</i>

1312
01:08:30,377 --> 01:08:31,537
<i>... and the fucking Shins.</i>

1313
01:08:31,712 --> 01:08:34,272
<i>And you'll blow a bunch of dudes</i> <i>and become a lesbian...</i>

1314
01:08:34,448 --> 01:08:37,178
<i>... and I'll be here in fucking</i> <i>Clark County doing shit-all.</i>

1315
01:08:37,351 --> 01:08:39,751
<i>You're gonna dump me.</i> <i>So, fuck it, have a good time.</i>

1316
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,013
A lesbian? Fuck you, Dale!

1317
01:08:42,189 --> 01:08:43,918
<i>You never did like me anyway,</i> <i>did you?</i>

1318
01:08:44,091 --> 01:08:45,615
<i>You didn't wanna meet my parents.</i>

1319
01:08:45,793 --> 01:08:48,387
I always cared about you. That's not what this is. Okay?

1320
01:08:48,562 --> 01:08:49,790
I always care about you.

1321
01:08:49,964 --> 01:08:51,795
Why don't you ever act like it, huh?

1322
01:08:51,966 --> 01:08:54,400
Why do you never act like you care about anything?

1323
01:08:54,568 --> 01:08:58,698
Because I'm high! Fuck! And it... What do you want...? Okay. Jesus.

1324
01:08:58,873 --> 01:09:00,898
Call me when I can go home.

1325
01:09:01,809 --> 01:09:06,303
You lost it playing Bid Whist? You pimp.

1326
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,711
No, I'll give you more, but you cannot gamble with it.

1327
01:09:10,384 --> 01:09:12,579
I know, I'm sorry about the clocks.

1328
01:09:12,753 --> 01:09:16,883
I couldn't remember if it was today or tomorrow. All right, I gotta go.

1329
01:09:17,057 --> 01:09:18,581
I love you.

1330
01:09:18,759 --> 01:09:20,920
You wise-ass.

1331
01:09:21,762 --> 01:09:24,526
Hey, you all right, man? That sounded pretty hectic.

1332
01:09:24,698 --> 01:09:27,098
I'm okay. Let's just get the fuck out of here.

1333
01:09:27,268 --> 01:09:28,360
First things first.

1334
01:09:30,304 --> 01:09:33,740
- Don't do that, okay? - Yeah. Why not?

1335
01:09:33,908 --> 01:09:36,069
Why not? Car chase, gunshots.

1336
01:09:36,243 --> 01:09:37,676
That clearly just happened...

1337
01:09:37,845 --> 01:09:40,211
...because we were smoking marijuana.

1338
01:09:40,381 --> 01:09:42,349
No, man. It happened because those kids...

1339
01:09:42,516 --> 01:09:44,677
...couldn't keep their shit on the down-low.

1340
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:47,719
In case you haven't noticed... Which you haven't.

1341
01:09:47,888 --> 01:09:50,356
From what I can tell, you don't notice anything ever.

1342
01:09:50,524 --> 01:09:53,891
- we are not very functional when we're high. Which is all the time.

1343
01:09:54,061 --> 01:09:56,791
Well, I don't know, man. I think I'm functioning right now.

1344
01:09:56,964 --> 01:09:59,797
I was, like, stoned when I saved you with those Slushees.

1345
01:09:59,967 --> 01:10:01,400
What do you gotta say to that?

1346
01:10:01,569 --> 01:10:04,129
Well, that would be true if you had saved me.

1347
01:10:04,305 --> 01:10:05,431
But you didn't save me.

1348
01:10:05,606 --> 01:10:07,506
She was gonna help, you made things worse.

1349
01:10:07,675 --> 01:10:09,540
We're wanted for all sorts of crazy shit.

1350
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:11,701
Don't fucking get on my case, all right?

1351
01:10:11,879 --> 01:10:13,540
Only reason I started selling pot...

1352
01:10:13,714 --> 01:10:16,308
...is so I could put my <i>bubbe</i> in a nice retirement home.

1353
01:10:16,483 --> 01:10:18,644
- She must be proud of you. - She is proud of me.

1354
01:10:18,819 --> 01:10:20,150
I'm gonna become something.

1355
01:10:20,321 --> 01:10:22,846
As soon as she dies, I'm gonna become a civil engineer.

1356
01:10:23,023 --> 01:10:25,355
I'm gonna design septic tanks for playgrounds.

1357
01:10:25,526 --> 01:10:27,016
Little kids can take shits.

1358
01:10:27,194 --> 01:10:28,821
You idiot. What the hell do you do?

1359
01:10:28,996 --> 01:10:31,089
What am I gonna do? Besides stay in my home...

1360
01:10:31,265 --> 01:10:33,825
...for fear that you've designed some object I'm around?

1361
01:10:34,001 --> 01:10:37,198
I'm gonna be on the radio, talking about life.

1362
01:10:37,371 --> 01:10:39,805
- Giving lessons about life. - Put me in my place.

1363
01:10:39,974 --> 01:10:42,465
I'm gonna be designing buildings and what's he doing?

1364
01:10:42,643 --> 01:10:44,474
Boring people to death on the radio.

1365
01:10:44,645 --> 01:10:48,240
You are an asshole. That's all you are. You're an asshole.

1366
01:10:48,415 --> 01:10:50,280
- I'm not an asshole. - You are an asshole.

1367
01:10:50,451 --> 01:10:53,420
I feel pretty sure that I'm not an asshole.

1368
01:10:53,587 --> 01:10:55,214
I'm, like, a totally nice guy.

1369
01:10:55,389 --> 01:10:57,880
I'm just as nice as you are. So don't bring that out.

1370
01:10:58,058 --> 01:10:59,855
In the woods, I gave you my jacket.

1371
01:11:00,027 --> 01:11:02,359
You were cold and I clothed you.

1372
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:06,129
How about in the park when I said that you were my friend?

1373
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:07,927
You didn't say anything back.

1374
01:11:08,102 --> 01:11:10,662
Well, that's easy. It's because we're not friends.

1375
01:11:10,838 --> 01:11:12,305
You are my drug dealer.

1376
01:11:12,473 --> 01:11:14,202
There's one reason we know each other.

1377
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:16,400
I like the drugs you sell. That's it.

1378
01:11:16,577 --> 01:11:19,808
If you didn't sell those drugs, I would have no idea who you were...

1379
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:23,108
...and I would be fantastic right now. Instead of looking like this.

1380
01:11:25,085 --> 01:11:28,077
That sounded mean. Just hearing it sounded mean.

1381
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,813
- I didn't mean to say... - It's out.

1382
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:32,424
Monkey's out of the bottle, man.

1383
01:11:32,593 --> 01:11:34,618
What? That's not even an expression.

1384
01:11:34,795 --> 01:11:37,525
Pandora doesn't go back in the box. He only comes out.

1385
01:11:37,698 --> 01:11:39,563
I'm sorry, man. Look...

1386
01:11:40,034 --> 01:11:43,526
- What are you doing? - Here. Have a nice last meal.

1387
01:11:43,704 --> 01:11:46,264
Come on, man. Don't do that.

1388
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,533
Why don't you supersize it, bitch?

1389
01:11:48,709 --> 01:11:51,109
I'm sorry, man. Look, come back.

1390
01:11:51,278 --> 01:11:53,508
I didn't mean that.

1391
01:12:05,926 --> 01:12:08,690
<i>I love you. Do you love me?</i>

1392
01:12:51,672 --> 01:12:53,299
That looks great.

1393
01:13:00,948 --> 01:13:02,381
Hello?

1394
01:13:03,484 --> 01:13:04,781
Dale?

1395
01:13:04,952 --> 01:13:06,317
<i>It is Dale.</i>

1396
01:13:06,487 --> 01:13:11,356
Angie, I'm calling because I love you more than anything in the world...

1397
01:13:11,525 --> 01:13:14,961
...and I wanna let you know I'll do anything to make it work.

1398
01:13:15,129 --> 01:13:16,858
<i>I'll do anything.</i>

1399
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:20,625
I've had a near-death experience, and when that happens...

1400
01:13:20,801 --> 01:13:23,497
...you can prioritize your life, and you are it, okay?

1401
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:25,831
<i>So please</i> <i>just take me back, please.</i>

1402
01:13:26,006 --> 01:13:28,099
- <i>I love you.</i> - I love you.

1403
01:13:29,476 --> 01:13:32,411
- Yeah? - <i>I just don't wanna lose you, Dale.</i>

1404
01:13:32,579 --> 01:13:36,037
We were driving away from the house and I just kept thinking...

1405
01:13:36,216 --> 01:13:37,444
I don't know. I just...

1406
01:13:37,618 --> 01:13:39,017
I wanna marry you.

1407
01:13:42,122 --> 01:13:43,783
I made a mistake.

1408
01:13:43,957 --> 01:13:46,289
- <i>What do you mean?</i> - I've...

1409
01:13:46,693 --> 01:13:49,093
- What? - <i>I'm just processing that last bit.</i>

1410
01:13:49,263 --> 01:13:51,857
- <i>You wanna... Oh, fuck.</i> - What?

1411
01:13:52,032 --> 01:13:53,590
I don't know.

1412
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:55,894
I realize now that if you would take me back...

1413
01:13:56,069 --> 01:13:58,003
...then you are very naive and immature.

1414
01:13:58,172 --> 01:14:01,733
You don't see what a fuck-up I am. I'm in no shape to be dated by anyone.

1415
01:14:01,909 --> 01:14:05,037
- You're the one that's immature. - <i>I'm not immature. You're immature.</i>

1416
01:14:05,212 --> 01:14:08,409
<i>I am somewhat immature,</i> <i>but you're more immature. I'm older.</i>

1417
01:14:08,582 --> 01:14:09,879
Just because you're older.

1418
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:12,575
I lost my virginity when I was 14 years old.

1419
01:14:12,753 --> 01:14:14,914
- <i>Really?</i> - How many girls have you slept with?

1420
01:14:15,088 --> 01:14:17,181
- Like, two and a half. - <i>Two and a half?</i>

1421
01:14:17,357 --> 01:14:18,551
What is a half? Your hand?

1422
01:14:18,725 --> 01:14:21,660
<i>No, it was the tip or I dipped a ball in.</i> <i>I can't remember why.</i>

1423
01:14:21,829 --> 01:14:24,491
<i>I remember thinking,</i> <i>"This doesn't count as a full point."</i>

1424
01:14:24,665 --> 01:14:27,031
<i>If I said three, I'd feel like a liar.</i> <i>I was drunk.</i>

1425
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:28,532
<i>Screw you.</i>

1426
01:14:28,702 --> 01:14:29,862
Get me out of this room.

1427
01:14:30,037 --> 01:14:33,097
<i>I will, and that's the last</i> <i>you'll ever hear from me, okay?</i>

1428
01:14:35,275 --> 01:14:39,075
Oh, thank goodness. Okay.

1429
01:14:42,282 --> 01:14:44,580
Belogus. Faye Belogus.

1430
01:14:46,019 --> 01:14:47,316
Lookit there. Lookit there.

1431
01:14:47,487 --> 01:14:49,318
Do you use the pool over here?

1432
01:14:49,489 --> 01:14:52,253
Yes, I use the pool. Come on, what do you want from me?

1433
01:14:52,426 --> 01:14:55,623
Your grandson. We need you to get on the phone with your grandson...

1434
01:14:55,796 --> 01:14:57,730
What are you talking about, my grandson?

1435
01:14:57,898 --> 01:15:00,628
You told me you wanna sit down, play dominos with me.

1436
01:15:00,801 --> 01:15:02,792
And now you're hocking me about my grandson.

1437
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:05,632
- Is that Yiddish? - Yes. Yes, it is.

1438
01:15:05,806 --> 01:15:06,932
May I call you Faye?

1439
01:15:07,107 --> 01:15:10,235
You can call me Faye, but I'm gonna call you a stinker.

1440
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:11,934
Hey, Mrs. Mendelson.

1441
01:15:12,112 --> 01:15:13,636
What do you want from me?

1442
01:15:13,814 --> 01:15:15,179
<i>Bubbe.</i> Hey, guys.

1443
01:15:15,349 --> 01:15:17,840
- Well, look who it is. - Hello, baby.

1444
01:15:21,955 --> 01:15:22,979
Damn.

1445
01:15:23,924 --> 01:15:25,255
Oh, shit.

1446
01:15:25,425 --> 01:15:27,017
Sorry, Betty.

1447
01:15:31,431 --> 01:15:33,797
They kidnapped my grandson.

1448
01:15:33,967 --> 01:15:35,867
Yeah, these two guys came in...

1449
01:15:36,036 --> 01:15:39,028
...they sat down with me to play dominos.

1450
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:41,299
I never saw them in my life before.

1451
01:15:41,475 --> 01:15:44,638
And they kept asking questions about my grandson.

1452
01:15:44,811 --> 01:15:49,271
- What did they look like? - One of them was very tall and sloppy.

1453
01:15:49,449 --> 01:15:53,215
And the other guy, he was very good-looking...

1454
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:54,718
...but he was short as shit.

1455
01:15:54,888 --> 01:15:56,822
But the worst part was...

1456
01:15:56,990 --> 01:16:01,359
...that my grandson came in, why, and in pajamas.

1457
01:16:01,528 --> 01:16:03,519
- You gotta find my grandson. - Do the best...

1458
01:16:03,697 --> 01:16:04,959
- Do you promise? - I promise.

1459
01:16:05,132 --> 01:16:06,997
Absolutely. You've got something there.

1460
01:16:07,167 --> 01:16:08,691
I believe that's a mole, ma'am.

1461
01:16:14,374 --> 01:16:17,571
You sack of shit. Do you know what a pain in the ass you've been?

1462
01:16:17,744 --> 01:16:19,507
No, man. I don't wanna get out.

1463
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:22,513
Who gave you that lollipop? Let's go.

1464
01:16:22,683 --> 01:16:24,878
Where am I, man? What?

1465
01:16:25,052 --> 01:16:28,510
You guys started it, man. I don't even wanna be here.

1466
01:16:28,689 --> 01:16:30,020
Shit. Did I do that?

1467
01:16:31,692 --> 01:16:34,684
Hey, hey. All right, okay.

1468
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:37,194
Fuck you, man!

1469
01:16:37,364 --> 01:16:40,060
- Stand back. Ted wants him alive. - Why you holding me back?

1470
01:16:40,233 --> 01:16:41,564
Ted wants him alive, okay?

1471
01:16:41,735 --> 01:16:43,726
I should be kicking his fucking teeth in.

1472
01:16:43,904 --> 01:16:47,305
- lf anybody's gonna beat him, it's Ted. - I look like Hamburglar.

1473
01:16:47,474 --> 01:16:48,498
And the Elephant Man.

1474
01:16:48,675 --> 01:16:50,870
Like someone fucked you up with a coffee pot.

1475
01:16:51,044 --> 01:16:52,773
Professional. Professional.

1476
01:16:52,946 --> 01:16:55,073
- Professional on this, bitch. - Whatever, man.

1477
01:16:55,248 --> 01:16:57,375
- Where were you? - I was there.

1478
01:16:57,551 --> 01:16:59,416
- Supposed to be my partner. - I was there.

1479
01:16:59,586 --> 01:17:01,247
No, you wasn't. How did this happen?

1480
01:17:01,421 --> 01:17:03,616
I take the hit? That's how it's gonna be?

1481
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:06,190
Fuck all this, you know? Get him out of here.

1482
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:09,591
Take him downstairs. Get this asshole out of my sight.

1483
01:17:09,763 --> 01:17:11,924
I don't wanna go near this guy.

1484
01:17:12,099 --> 01:17:15,068
What's down there? Fucking rancor?

1485
01:17:15,235 --> 01:17:16,862
I might act tough...

1486
01:17:17,037 --> 01:17:19,096
...but I got a lot of feelings.

1487
01:17:19,506 --> 01:17:22,407
And you hurt damn near every one of them.

1488
01:17:23,443 --> 01:17:25,138
This ain't over.

1489
01:17:25,612 --> 01:17:27,477
- You know you gonna die, right? - Yeah.

1490
01:17:27,647 --> 01:17:29,706
I'm gonna kill the fuck out of you.

1491
01:17:29,883 --> 01:17:33,148
I hope you enjoy these last 17 minutes of your life...

1492
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,584
...because when Ted gets here, he's gonna be like:

1493
01:17:35,756 --> 01:17:38,816
"Kill that motherfucker." I'm gonna kill your motherfucking ass.

1494
01:17:38,992 --> 01:17:40,016
Watch your head.

1495
01:17:41,962 --> 01:17:43,759
Hey, watch him.

1496
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,827
Oh, my God.

1497
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,332
El Dorado.

1498
01:17:49,669 --> 01:17:51,899
The legends are true.

1499
01:17:52,506 --> 01:17:54,701
Look at all this weed, man.

1500
01:17:54,875 --> 01:17:56,604
What's that? Purple Granddaddy?

1501
01:17:56,777 --> 01:17:59,143
- Come on. - Purple Nurple?

1502
01:17:59,312 --> 01:18:01,109
OG Kush?

1503
01:18:01,281 --> 01:18:02,612
OG Kush.

1504
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:12,418
It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

1505
01:18:12,592 --> 01:18:14,253
- What kind of irrigation...? - Shut up.

1506
01:18:14,428 --> 01:18:16,328
- Can I touch it? - Come here.

1507
01:18:31,711 --> 01:18:33,508
Hello?

1508
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,079
Red?

1509
01:18:41,254 --> 01:18:43,154
- Red? - What the fuck?

1510
01:18:43,323 --> 01:18:46,121
Get out of here, man. I didn't do shit, Denton.

1511
01:18:46,293 --> 01:18:49,387
Look, I come in peace, okay? I'm not here to fight you again.

1512
01:18:49,563 --> 01:18:50,996
Good.

1513
01:18:51,164 --> 01:18:53,894
Because I'm tired, man. Not feeling so hot.

1514
01:18:54,067 --> 01:18:55,932
You don't look great.

1515
01:18:56,103 --> 01:18:57,627
They shot me, Denton.

1516
01:18:57,804 --> 01:18:59,101
They got me right here.

1517
01:18:59,272 --> 01:19:00,603
- Yeah? - Right here.

1518
01:19:00,774 --> 01:19:02,571
And then they got me again right here.

1519
01:19:02,742 --> 01:19:05,973
Look, man, I'll call 911 right now.

1520
01:19:06,146 --> 01:19:07,670
They'll save your life, okay?

1521
01:19:07,848 --> 01:19:09,748
- You don't need to die. - No, bro.

1522
01:19:09,916 --> 01:19:12,544
You don't get it. It doesn't really matter where I'm at.

1523
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:14,983
If I'm at the hospital, if I'm here...

1524
01:19:15,155 --> 01:19:17,248
...Ted's gonna find me, man. He will.

1525
01:19:17,424 --> 01:19:20,359
And when he does, he's gonna fucking kill me.

1526
01:19:20,527 --> 01:19:22,154
He's just, like, an asshole.

1527
01:19:22,329 --> 01:19:25,264
I couldn't agree more, Red. That's why I've come here, okay?

1528
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:27,297
You know Ted? He took Saul.

1529
01:19:27,467 --> 01:19:28,832
And I'm gonna get him back.

1530
01:19:29,002 --> 01:19:30,993
You know, like, he saved my life.

1531
01:19:31,171 --> 01:19:34,299
We've been on the run together. He's a great friend. A good guy.

1532
01:19:34,474 --> 01:19:37,307
He is. I'll tell you that, man. Saul is a good dude.

1533
01:19:37,477 --> 01:19:38,535
I was mean to him, man.

1534
01:19:38,712 --> 01:19:41,442
I wronged him and I can't... I can't let it end like that.

1535
01:19:41,615 --> 01:19:45,278
I'm just into Buddhism and I'm at peace with the fact...

1536
01:19:45,452 --> 01:19:49,354
...that me as this person, probably gonna not be around.

1537
01:19:49,523 --> 01:19:51,457
Think about a hermit crab, okay?

1538
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:55,584
And it's a shell, and it's like they go from one shell to the next.

1539
01:19:55,762 --> 01:19:59,892
And that's what I am. It's like I'm just a hermit crab changing shells.

1540
01:20:00,066 --> 01:20:02,432
Except, if you're a dick your whole life...

1541
01:20:02,602 --> 01:20:05,469
...your next shell will be made of shit, okay?

1542
01:20:05,639 --> 01:20:08,403
If you're an asshole, you're gonna come back as a cockroach.

1543
01:20:08,575 --> 01:20:12,306
Or a worm, or a fucking anal bead, okay?

1544
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:14,879
If you're a man, and you act heroic...

1545
01:20:15,048 --> 01:20:16,606
...you'll come back as an eagle.

1546
01:20:16,783 --> 01:20:18,341
You'll come back as a dragon.

1547
01:20:18,518 --> 01:20:20,179
You'll come back as Jude Law.

1548
01:20:20,987 --> 01:20:23,182
Okay? Which would you rather be?

1549
01:20:23,356 --> 01:20:26,689
Maybe the anal bead. Might... Depending on who it belongs to.

1550
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:27,884
It belongs to me.

1551
01:20:28,061 --> 01:20:29,494
- Then the dragon. - Exactly.

1552
01:20:29,663 --> 01:20:33,497
You need to help me, okay? Just use it, you know? Use the pain.

1553
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:34,895
You'll have a second wind.

1554
01:20:35,068 --> 01:20:37,468
Let's get up and go get Saul back. Use it.

1555
01:20:37,637 --> 01:20:40,299
- Aren't you angry at Ted? - Yeah, I'm really mad at him.

1556
01:20:40,473 --> 01:20:43,636
What do you wanna do? Don't you wanna get up, do something about it?

1557
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:46,108
Maybe that would be cool to do to him.

1558
01:20:46,279 --> 01:20:47,940
I don't think "maybe" is the answer.

1559
01:20:48,114 --> 01:20:50,412
I think, "Yes, I'm gonna help you, Dale"...

1560
01:20:50,584 --> 01:20:52,347
...that's the answer I'm looking for.

1561
01:20:53,987 --> 01:20:55,352
Come here.

1562
01:20:58,558 --> 01:21:02,255
Ted Jones messed with the wrong melon farmers.

1563
01:21:04,731 --> 01:21:06,790
Thug life.

1564
01:21:12,772 --> 01:21:14,000
Oh, shit.

1565
01:21:14,174 --> 01:21:16,904
Get those. I don't wanna run them over in the vacuum...

1566
01:21:17,077 --> 01:21:19,136
...and shoot my face off, okay? - I'm sorry.

1567
01:21:26,119 --> 01:21:28,815
I used to use this little gun when I was a prostitute.

1568
01:21:33,827 --> 01:21:35,727
Don't.

1569
01:21:35,895 --> 01:21:36,919
Don't.

1570
01:21:37,097 --> 01:21:38,758
Just something quick like that.

1571
01:21:38,932 --> 01:21:40,422
- Don't. - Yeah.

1572
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,727
- Don't. You stop it right now. - Stop it.

1573
01:21:56,016 --> 01:21:57,847
Oh, God.

1574
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:02,579
That's a big hideout.

1575
01:22:04,524 --> 01:22:06,549
I can't do this. I'm sorry. I can't do this.

1576
01:22:06,726 --> 01:22:09,695
I'm infected. My shit's all fucked up. I need medical attention.

1577
01:22:09,863 --> 01:22:12,764
What? I thought we just got all pumped up. What was that about?

1578
01:22:12,932 --> 01:22:15,366
Ted is a fucking murderer. I can't fuck with him.

1579
01:22:15,535 --> 01:22:17,628
I got a wife. She's gonna be out of jail soon.

1580
01:22:17,804 --> 01:22:20,705
I wanna fuck her. I am not gonna wake up murdered tomorrow.

1581
01:22:20,874 --> 01:22:23,035
Oh, man, no. This is lame of you, man.

1582
01:22:23,209 --> 01:22:25,575
Come on. This could be your moment of redemption.

1583
01:22:25,745 --> 01:22:26,939
This could be your moment.

1584
01:22:27,113 --> 01:22:29,673
I don't want a moment. I don't want... Fine, go.

1585
01:22:29,849 --> 01:22:30,873
Fuck you.

1586
01:22:31,051 --> 01:22:33,212
Please come back for me. Please come back.

1587
01:22:33,386 --> 01:22:37,584
Legends never die, dude. I'll tell your story.

1588
01:22:38,291 --> 01:22:41,158
Carol, she's cool now.

1589
01:22:41,328 --> 01:22:45,264
Carol used to be a little crazy, man. She used to throw tickle parties.

1590
01:22:45,432 --> 01:22:47,730
- Sounds like home-cooking to me. - That was fun.

1591
01:22:47,901 --> 01:22:50,301
Game over, motherfuckers! Everybody freeze!

1592
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:52,768
Tell me where my friend is or this guy gets it!

1593
01:22:52,939 --> 01:22:55,169
All right, everybody be cool, man. Be cool.

1594
01:22:55,342 --> 01:22:56,866
Put your guns down. Nobody shoots.

1595
01:22:57,043 --> 01:22:58,635
Put them down. On the ground.

1596
01:22:58,812 --> 01:23:01,178
All right, everybody just chill.

1597
01:23:01,348 --> 01:23:03,248
Oh, my God!

1598
01:23:03,416 --> 01:23:05,077
- You shot him. - Put the gun down.

1599
01:23:05,251 --> 01:23:07,776
- Drop the fucking gun. - Don't shoot me!

1600
01:23:07,954 --> 01:23:10,252
- Holy shit. - I said, nobody shoot. You shot Pete.

1601
01:23:10,423 --> 01:23:12,220
That's right. I shot him. I shot him.

1602
01:23:12,392 --> 01:23:15,122
I shot him. I don't have time for a fucking negotiation.

1603
01:23:15,295 --> 01:23:17,786
Now, I wanna finish this off so I can go home...

1604
01:23:17,964 --> 01:23:19,898
...and have dinner with my wife for once.

1605
01:23:20,066 --> 01:23:22,193
If anybody asks, Denton killed Pete.

1606
01:23:22,369 --> 01:23:24,166
End of story.

1607
01:23:24,337 --> 01:23:26,362
I'm telling Ted.

1608
01:23:26,539 --> 01:23:28,302
- lf you do... - He's got a piece.

1609
01:23:28,475 --> 01:23:30,067
- Motherfucker. - Okay, I'm sorry.

1610
01:23:30,243 --> 01:23:31,904
He's got another one, in the side.

1611
01:23:32,078 --> 01:23:33,670
Damn it. I got one more on my leg.

1612
01:23:33,847 --> 01:23:36,111
There's one more. I know you'll find it. Take it.

1613
01:23:36,282 --> 01:23:38,443
I'm sorry, guys. Sorry I deceived you.

1614
01:23:38,618 --> 01:23:39,846
No. Come on.

1615
01:23:42,922 --> 01:23:45,390
- Oh, great. - Saul.

1616
01:23:45,558 --> 01:23:46,650
- Dale. - Yes.

1617
01:23:46,826 --> 01:23:49,989
What did you do, rat me out? Is that what you did, you bastard?

1618
01:23:50,163 --> 01:23:52,028
- No, man. - Yes.

1619
01:23:52,198 --> 01:23:53,893
I'm here to save you.

1620
01:23:54,067 --> 01:23:56,729
No. You just got caught too.

1621
01:23:56,903 --> 01:23:59,269
And I'm gonna die in here with some asshole.

1622
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:01,498
Okay, you know what? I deserved that.

1623
01:24:01,674 --> 01:24:04,507
I'll take that because I have been an asshole, man.

1624
01:24:04,677 --> 01:24:07,840
This whole thing is my fault. I ruined your life.

1625
01:24:08,248 --> 01:24:11,217
Okay? And I know there's no way...

1626
01:24:11,384 --> 01:24:13,818
...to make that up to you except by saving your life.

1627
01:24:13,987 --> 01:24:17,047
So that's what I came here to do. I'm here to save my best friend.

1628
01:24:17,223 --> 01:24:19,748
Because that's what you are. You're my best friend.

1629
01:24:19,926 --> 01:24:21,655
You're a mean jerk.

1630
01:24:21,828 --> 01:24:24,797
I was mean. I was mean because, I think...

1631
01:24:24,964 --> 01:24:27,194
I didn't want you to be my best friend.

1632
01:24:27,367 --> 01:24:30,063
I didn't wanna think that that's what my life was.

1633
01:24:30,236 --> 01:24:32,704
Now I realize I'm lucky to have you as my best friend.

1634
01:24:32,872 --> 01:24:34,362
You're the best guy I know.

1635
01:24:35,074 --> 01:24:36,371
BFFF.

1636
01:24:36,543 --> 01:24:38,977
Best fucking friends forever, man. Seriously.

1637
01:24:42,315 --> 01:24:44,510
- All right. Give me a hug. - Yeah. Okay.

1638
01:24:44,684 --> 01:24:47,084
Thanks, man. I'm so sorry about everything.

1639
01:24:47,253 --> 01:24:48,584
Oh, I'm such a dick.

1640
01:24:48,755 --> 01:24:51,918
- Okay. I'm gonna get us out. - No, you're not, but it's okay.

1641
01:24:52,091 --> 01:24:54,992
These guys are gonna fucking kill us. We gotta get out of here.

1642
01:24:55,161 --> 01:24:56,890
- I know. They are. - Fuck, man.

1643
01:24:57,063 --> 01:25:01,397
We can hear you outside and it's very fucking annoying, all right?

1644
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:04,128
- Okay. Sorry about that, sir. - Shut the fuck up.

1645
01:25:04,304 --> 01:25:06,431
Do you know what "shut the fuck up" mean?

1646
01:25:06,606 --> 01:25:08,096
I do.

1647
01:25:08,274 --> 01:25:10,071
Shit. Stupid motherfuckers.

1648
01:25:10,844 --> 01:25:14,177
Yes. Okay. I got an idea. I got an idea. My belt buckle. My belt buckle.

1649
01:25:14,347 --> 01:25:17,805
Right here. Okay? Rub your wrists against my belt buckle. That'll do it.

1650
01:25:19,185 --> 01:25:20,777
- Is it working? - I can't feel it.

1651
01:25:20,954 --> 01:25:21,978
I can't feel you.

1652
01:25:22,155 --> 01:25:24,089
- Wait, I feel it. - I feel it. Yes, okay.

1653
01:25:24,257 --> 01:25:25,656
- Okay. - Okay. Okay.

1654
01:25:25,825 --> 01:25:27,918
- I'm gonna save you, man. - Yeah. Yeah.

1655
01:25:28,094 --> 01:25:29,857
- Let me save you. - Save me, Dale.

1656
01:25:30,029 --> 01:25:31,894
It's not working. We gotta change angles.

1657
01:25:32,065 --> 01:25:34,295
We gotta get more leverage-y. Okay.

1658
01:25:34,467 --> 01:25:35,957
Okay, that's good. That's good.

1659
01:25:36,135 --> 01:25:38,069
Get your hands up on it. There we go.

1660
01:25:38,238 --> 01:25:40,331
- All right. All right. - Yeah. Okay.

1661
01:25:41,441 --> 01:25:43,568
- Yes. Yes. - Okay.

1662
01:25:43,743 --> 01:25:46,143
I'm gonna save you, man. I'm gonna save you.

1663
01:25:46,312 --> 01:25:48,610
- You're my best friend, man. - Yeah, see?

1664
01:25:48,781 --> 01:25:51,875
- It's not working. - Let me use my... I'll use my mouth.

1665
01:25:52,051 --> 01:25:54,019
Finish it off with my mouth, pal. Let's go.

1666
01:25:54,187 --> 01:25:56,280
Come on. Let's go.

1667
01:25:56,456 --> 01:25:58,321
Harder.

1668
01:26:06,933 --> 01:26:09,333
- Where are these fuckers? - We got them downstairs.

1669
01:26:09,502 --> 01:26:12,198
- Where did you find them? - Found Saul at his grandmother's.

1670
01:26:12,372 --> 01:26:15,273
He fucked up Matheson's face. Hit him with a pot of hot coffee.

1671
01:26:15,441 --> 01:26:16,874
It's gross.

1672
01:26:17,043 --> 01:26:19,307
Dale Denton comes flying in here like a madman...

1673
01:26:19,479 --> 01:26:23,279
...armed to the teeth, and, as you can see, he shot Peter.

1674
01:26:23,449 --> 01:26:25,644
Plugged him, just whacked him.

1675
01:26:25,818 --> 01:26:29,049
Now they're both disarmed and they're downstairs.

1676
01:26:29,222 --> 01:26:30,780
He shot Pete?

1677
01:26:30,957 --> 01:26:32,948
Fucking Pete? He was ex-CIA.

1678
01:26:33,126 --> 01:26:35,651
Who the fuck is this Dale Denton?

1679
01:26:35,828 --> 01:26:39,127
Who is he? Where did he come from? I do not know.

1680
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:45,729
Time to cook shit up tonight.

1681
01:26:45,905 --> 01:26:47,930
Take his stash and burn this motherfucker down.

1682
01:26:49,309 --> 01:26:51,209
Stop. Wait here.

1683
01:26:51,377 --> 01:26:54,141
No retreat, no surrender.

1684
01:26:59,619 --> 01:27:00,643
Yes, yes, yes.

1685
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:03,653
- Wait, someone's coming. - Okay, okay, okay.

1686
01:27:03,823 --> 01:27:07,224
If I cough once, I'll take the lead. If I cough twice, you go, okay?

1687
01:27:07,393 --> 01:27:09,588
Well... I cough sometimes for real.

1688
01:27:09,762 --> 01:27:11,662
Just don't. Don't...

1689
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:20,330
Yo, look. I'm gonna say this one time.

1690
01:27:20,506 --> 01:27:24,602
Whatever you're doing, I get it, okay?

1691
01:27:24,777 --> 01:27:26,267
Stop.

1692
01:27:29,649 --> 01:27:32,209
See, I don't think you understood me.

1693
01:27:32,385 --> 01:27:34,216
I can hear everything you're saying.

1694
01:27:34,387 --> 01:27:37,083
One cough mean you go. Two cough mean you take the lead.

1695
01:27:37,256 --> 01:27:39,747
The belt buckle. Best friends forever.

1696
01:27:39,926 --> 01:27:42,190
Y'all fuck on your own time, man.

1697
01:27:42,362 --> 01:27:43,920
Sorry, man. It was a stupid plan.

1698
01:27:44,097 --> 01:27:46,531
What the fuck is that?

1699
01:27:48,835 --> 01:27:49,859
Dale!

1700
01:27:54,007 --> 01:27:57,408
I've been waiting for this. You burned my face!

1701
01:27:59,712 --> 01:28:02,044
I'm gonna tear this ass up.

1702
01:28:08,554 --> 01:28:10,044
You shot me.

1703
01:28:10,223 --> 01:28:11,588
I'm sorry, man.

1704
01:28:11,758 --> 01:28:15,455
I've never been shot. Damn, that hurt.

1705
01:28:15,628 --> 01:28:17,255
I got glass in my ass.

1706
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:20,024
- Dale. Dale! - This is messed up.

1707
01:28:20,199 --> 01:28:22,292
Has anyone seen my bigger knife?

1708
01:28:24,637 --> 01:28:26,696
Asians!

1709
01:28:31,711 --> 01:28:32,678
War is upon you!

1710
01:28:32,845 --> 01:28:34,642
Prepare to suck the cock of karma!

1711
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:41,912
Get down, motherfucker!

1712
01:28:46,459 --> 01:28:47,687
Come on!

1713
01:28:50,396 --> 01:28:51,624
Fuck!

1714
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,371
Go! Go!

1715
01:29:02,542 --> 01:29:03,702
Get down, baby!

1716
01:29:03,876 --> 01:29:05,605
Dale, no!

1717
01:29:05,778 --> 01:29:07,405
No, wake up, man.

1718
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:09,445
No, you're not dying, man.

1719
01:29:09,615 --> 01:29:12,175
Not without me.

1720
01:29:12,351 --> 01:29:13,682
- Dale. - What?

1721
01:29:13,853 --> 01:29:15,684
You're alive.

1722
01:29:15,855 --> 01:29:19,382
- You're... You're alive. - What happened?

1723
01:29:19,959 --> 01:29:22,018
- He got your ear, man. - He got my what?

1724
01:29:22,195 --> 01:29:24,925
- He got your ear. - Fuck!

1725
01:29:26,065 --> 01:29:27,692
Fuck!

1726
01:29:29,969 --> 01:29:31,459
- Help! - My ear.

1727
01:29:31,637 --> 01:29:32,661
- Yeah. - Help!

1728
01:29:32,839 --> 01:29:34,932
- You killed my ear. - You shot me.

1729
01:29:35,108 --> 01:29:37,008
- I didn't do that. - He shot me.

1730
01:29:37,176 --> 01:29:38,200
You shot him?

1731
01:29:38,377 --> 01:29:40,607
- Get your hands off of me. - Shut up.

1732
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:42,407
We've had enough out of you.

1733
01:29:42,582 --> 01:29:43,810
I'm not your friend.

1734
01:29:43,983 --> 01:29:45,348
Maybe I can just...

1735
01:29:45,518 --> 01:29:47,509
No. No, infected.

1736
01:29:47,687 --> 01:29:50,087
Is that it? Maybe if we just hold it.

1737
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:26,251
It's clear.

1738
01:30:27,193 --> 01:30:29,525
Dude. Look.

1739
01:30:29,695 --> 01:30:31,253
Nice.

1740
01:30:43,609 --> 01:30:45,133
Bullets.

1741
01:30:53,286 --> 01:30:56,119
So seriously, how gross does my ear look?

1742
01:30:56,289 --> 01:30:59,622
Is it really disgusting or is it, like, kind of cool in a way?

1743
01:30:59,792 --> 01:31:01,851
Right now it's pretty disgusting.

1744
01:31:02,028 --> 01:31:03,996
I feel like I can smell it.

1745
01:31:04,163 --> 01:31:06,631
Don't worry, bro. Think about Evander Holyfield.

1746
01:31:06,799 --> 01:31:07,857
You can't even tell.

1747
01:31:08,034 --> 01:31:09,126
That's a good point.

1748
01:31:09,302 --> 01:31:10,701
Wait.

1749
01:31:53,412 --> 01:31:54,777
Did you shoot that guy?

1750
01:31:54,947 --> 01:31:56,539
No. I'm out of bullets.

1751
01:31:56,716 --> 01:31:58,240
Me too.

1752
01:31:58,417 --> 01:32:00,681
Maybe it was ricochet.

1753
01:32:00,853 --> 01:32:02,844
Gravity.

1754
01:32:03,022 --> 01:32:04,751
Oh, nice.

1755
01:32:04,924 --> 01:32:06,858
You go down.

1756
01:32:07,026 --> 01:32:08,186
I'll cover.

1757
01:32:08,361 --> 01:32:11,524
Watch my back. I'll go down and take care of this.

1758
01:32:16,035 --> 01:32:17,866
Sexy motherfucker.

1759
01:32:36,522 --> 01:32:38,922
No, no, there might be more bad guys up there.

1760
01:32:39,091 --> 01:32:41,355
No, we'll sneak out through the vent. Come on.

1761
01:32:41,527 --> 01:32:44,758
I'll boost you up, okay? And then you pull me up.

1762
01:32:46,499 --> 01:32:48,296
Oh, nice.

1763
01:32:49,802 --> 01:32:51,394
Here we go. Okay.

1764
01:32:51,570 --> 01:32:54,505
Get up. Yeah. Nice.

1765
01:32:57,410 --> 01:32:58,434
Nice.

1766
01:32:59,078 --> 01:33:00,909
Nice. Okay.

1767
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:02,342
Pull me up.

1768
01:33:02,515 --> 01:33:04,312
I'm ready. Go.

1769
01:33:04,483 --> 01:33:06,280
- Give it to me. - Come on.

1770
01:33:06,452 --> 01:33:08,886
- Be taller. - Be stronger.

1771
01:33:09,055 --> 01:33:11,046
- Pull harder. - Dale, come on.

1772
01:33:11,223 --> 01:33:13,953
Pull. Pull me. Come on, man.

1773
01:33:14,126 --> 01:33:16,924
- I'm jumping as high as I can. - Denton!

1774
01:33:19,865 --> 01:33:20,889
Dale!

1775
01:33:21,067 --> 01:33:22,591
I'll get help. I'll get help.

1776
01:33:24,403 --> 01:33:27,634
Go ahead and run, you little dipshit. I'll find you.

1777
01:34:55,294 --> 01:34:57,125
Give me that fire extinguisher.

1778
01:34:57,296 --> 01:34:58,490
Okay.

1779
01:35:19,819 --> 01:35:23,152
You and me, baby. Drop it now! Put the bag down!

1780
01:35:23,322 --> 01:35:24,482
Now!

1781
01:35:39,405 --> 01:35:40,531
Fuck you!

1782
01:35:45,678 --> 01:35:48,579
Fuck the police!

1783
01:36:09,101 --> 01:36:11,467
Motherfucking kill you!

1784
01:36:13,873 --> 01:36:16,398
- Why you doing this to me? - Why you doing this to me?

1785
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:19,000
Oh, shit!

1786
01:36:19,178 --> 01:36:20,372
Come here!

1787
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:29,654
I hate you!

1788
01:36:29,822 --> 01:36:32,086
No! Ted, stop it!

1789
01:36:39,031 --> 01:36:41,932
Come on, bitch. Come on, I'll twist your balls so tight.

1790
01:36:42,101 --> 01:36:44,069
You're in the jungle now, baby.

1791
01:36:52,044 --> 01:36:53,102
Jesus!

1792
01:37:00,519 --> 01:37:02,043
Fuck.

1793
01:37:11,297 --> 01:37:12,855
Gonna die.

1794
01:37:15,501 --> 01:37:17,867
- You killed... - I didn't wanna do that.

1795
01:37:18,938 --> 01:37:20,872
But you weren't gonna stop.

1796
01:37:27,413 --> 01:37:28,971
Shoot him!

1797
01:37:29,148 --> 01:37:31,480
Just take it easy, buddy.

1798
01:37:33,252 --> 01:37:35,618
Shoot him, you dumb fuck!

1799
01:37:38,757 --> 01:37:40,520
I'm hungry.

1800
01:37:40,693 --> 01:37:42,627
I'm going home.

1801
01:37:46,532 --> 01:37:48,193
All right.

1802
01:37:49,802 --> 01:37:51,463
Help.

1803
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:55,969
I knew you were going soft.

1804
01:37:56,141 --> 01:37:59,235
Dinner's gonna be cold tonight, asshole.

1805
01:37:59,411 --> 01:38:01,470
Fucked up, man.

1806
01:38:03,682 --> 01:38:07,243
- Well, lookie here. Mr. Folgers. - Oh, man.

1807
01:38:07,419 --> 01:38:08,852
What's up, sir?

1808
01:38:09,488 --> 01:38:13,288
- Look, I didn't wanna hit you, man... - Shut the fuck up.

1809
01:38:13,459 --> 01:38:17,953
You think you was gonna get me, motherfucker, huh?

1810
01:38:18,130 --> 01:38:20,724
You need to sit your little sexy ass down...

1811
01:38:20,899 --> 01:38:23,026
...and watch yourself get killed now.

1812
01:38:23,202 --> 01:38:24,635
All right.

1813
01:38:24,803 --> 01:38:26,862
You know what? This is how it's gonna be?

1814
01:38:27,039 --> 01:38:30,634
All right. This is how it ends.

1815
01:38:46,792 --> 01:38:50,888
You just got killed by a Daewoo Lanos, motherfucker.

1816
01:38:51,063 --> 01:38:52,553
How you like me now, huh?

1817
01:38:53,899 --> 01:38:55,059
Gross.

1818
01:38:55,234 --> 01:38:56,258
Red?

1819
01:38:56,702 --> 01:38:57,862
Saul.

1820
01:38:58,037 --> 01:39:00,938
Hey, Saul. I came back for you, bro.

1821
01:39:01,106 --> 01:39:02,767
- Yeah. - I remembered, man.

1822
01:39:03,609 --> 01:39:05,099
Bro's before ho's.

1823
01:39:05,811 --> 01:39:08,780
- You lied to me. - I did. I lied bigtime to you.

1824
01:39:08,947 --> 01:39:13,384
Dale said that you didn't even have herpes and I said that you did.

1825
01:39:13,552 --> 01:39:17,147
Honestly, like, from now on, from everything that we've gone through...

1826
01:39:17,323 --> 01:39:21,123
...and, like, from seeing this asshole's nuts smashed with my Daewoo...

1827
01:39:21,293 --> 01:39:24,285
...I wanna be a better friend to you, like I really am.

1828
01:39:25,064 --> 01:39:27,931
I fucking love you, dog. Fucking love you.

1829
01:39:28,567 --> 01:39:30,660
I wanna be inside you, homes.

1830
01:39:31,904 --> 01:39:33,667
No more lies, Red.

1831
01:39:33,839 --> 01:39:36,364
- This is my moment. - This is your moment.

1832
01:39:38,977 --> 01:39:40,467
Red!

1833
01:39:58,130 --> 01:40:01,065
You know what? I'm feeling it.

1834
01:40:01,233 --> 01:40:03,098
Red, I'm coming, baby.

1835
01:40:03,268 --> 01:40:05,702
Your stupidity amazes me.

1836
01:40:08,107 --> 01:40:09,870
Hey, Ted!

1837
01:40:10,042 --> 01:40:12,010
You killed my brother...

1838
01:40:12,177 --> 01:40:15,271
...Caucasian son of cocksucker!

1839
01:40:15,447 --> 01:40:18,473
Suck my balls! Two times!

1840
01:40:26,325 --> 01:40:27,417
Bitch!

1841
01:40:27,593 --> 01:40:29,117
Bring it on.

1842
01:40:40,739 --> 01:40:41,763
Shit. Dale.

1843
01:40:43,308 --> 01:40:45,503
Dale!

1844
01:40:45,677 --> 01:40:47,338
Holy shit!

1845
01:41:23,849 --> 01:41:24,873
Sorry, Ted.

1846
01:41:29,054 --> 01:41:31,022
You've been served.

1847
01:41:38,163 --> 01:41:40,927
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1848
01:41:41,099 --> 01:41:43,624
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1849
01:41:47,906 --> 01:41:49,533
Saul! Saul!

1850
01:41:55,113 --> 01:41:58,048
Wake up, man! This place is gonna collapse! Come on!

1851
01:41:58,217 --> 01:42:00,048
Come to me!

1852
01:42:02,087 --> 01:42:03,952
You're not dying today, friend.

1853
01:42:04,122 --> 01:42:06,989
Not on my watch.

1854
01:42:33,986 --> 01:42:37,183
Saul. Wake up, man, please.

1855
01:42:37,356 --> 01:42:38,789
Saul.

1856
01:42:38,957 --> 01:42:40,447
Wake up.

1857
01:42:40,626 --> 01:42:43,060
Oh, sweet Saul.

1858
01:42:45,564 --> 01:42:48,260
Saul.

1859
01:42:51,103 --> 01:42:52,900
Yes. Yeah.

1860
01:42:53,071 --> 01:42:54,538
Saul, you made it.

1861
01:42:54,706 --> 01:42:57,231
- What? - Yeah.

1862
01:42:57,409 --> 01:42:59,343
Where am I?

1863
01:42:59,511 --> 01:43:01,536
You made it, man.

1864
01:43:01,713 --> 01:43:04,238
- You saved me. - You came back for me.

1865
01:43:04,416 --> 01:43:07,442
- Yeah. - Oh, thank you.

1866
01:43:07,619 --> 01:43:08,950
What happened?

1867
01:43:09,121 --> 01:43:10,349
What happened?

1868
01:43:16,862 --> 01:43:19,262
Holy shit.

1869
01:43:23,168 --> 01:43:24,897
What's that?

1870
01:43:27,673 --> 01:43:29,538
Hi.

1871
01:43:29,708 --> 01:43:31,573
- Red? - Red?

1872
01:43:34,413 --> 01:43:37,177
- Red. - Hey.

1873
01:43:37,349 --> 01:43:40,682
Red. Where'd you come from, man? Where'd he come from?

1874
01:43:40,852 --> 01:43:41,944
He came back to save us.

1875
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:43,178
- He saved us? - Yeah.

1876
01:43:43,355 --> 01:43:44,788
All right, man.

1877
01:43:44,957 --> 01:43:47,084
- We all saved each other. - Yeah.

1878
01:43:47,259 --> 01:43:50,126
Oh, man. We made it, guys.

1879
01:43:50,295 --> 01:43:53,924
We made it. Oh, we made it.

1880
01:43:59,371 --> 01:44:04,331
<i>Hello, you're listening to PPRPBP.</i> <i>I am Dale Denton.</i>

1881
01:44:04,509 --> 01:44:08,343
<i>The topic of the day: new beginnings.</i> <i>Getting over losses.</i>

1882
01:44:08,513 --> 01:44:10,913
<i>Friends. Life.</i>

1883
01:44:11,083 --> 01:44:13,677
We have our first caller.

1884
01:44:13,852 --> 01:44:16,480
Yes, ring-ring-ring. How's it going?

1885
01:44:16,655 --> 01:44:18,282
Hi. Am I on the air?

1886
01:44:18,457 --> 01:44:21,483
You are. You're about to get D'd by the Dale.

1887
01:44:21,660 --> 01:44:22,718
A D in the face.

1888
01:44:22,894 --> 01:44:24,259
- Dale Denton? - Yeah?

1889
01:44:24,429 --> 01:44:26,363
You're my hero.

1890
01:44:26,531 --> 01:44:29,056
You're my hero.

1891
01:44:29,768 --> 01:44:31,258
You are good, man. Seriously.

1892
01:44:31,436 --> 01:44:33,336
- Thanks. - Gotta admit, you're pretty good.

1893
01:44:33,505 --> 01:44:35,496
- It sounds pretty good. - It sounds real.

1894
01:44:35,674 --> 01:44:38,472
- It's not bad, huh? - lf I close my eyes, it sounds like...

1895
01:44:38,644 --> 01:44:41,738
- You are on the radio. - That's the radio. That's a DJ.

1896
01:44:41,913 --> 01:44:44,780
- lf you were on it, I would listen to it. - Thanks, man.

1897
01:44:44,950 --> 01:44:47,316
It's like when my <i>bubbe</i> was always playing opera...

1898
01:44:47,486 --> 01:44:49,317
...I hated it, but my <i>bubbe</i> loves it.

1899
01:44:49,488 --> 01:44:52,286
Then it grows on you. It grows on you. Yeah.

1900
01:44:52,457 --> 01:44:55,051
It's like Red. I didn't like Red when I first met him.

1901
01:44:55,227 --> 01:44:57,320
- You didn't like me? - You liked him so much...

1902
01:44:57,496 --> 01:44:59,259
...I like you now.

1903
01:44:59,431 --> 01:45:02,889
I know this sounds weird, but can we be best friends? Just us, for real?

1904
01:45:03,068 --> 01:45:05,093
- We should all be best friends. - We should.

1905
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:08,501
Seriously. You guys are, like, both of my best friends.

1906
01:45:08,674 --> 01:45:11,472
You didn't know it. Now you know it, we'll all be best friends.

1907
01:45:11,643 --> 01:45:13,838
Know those hearts that break up, "best friends"?

1908
01:45:14,012 --> 01:45:15,411
We should get a three-way one.

1909
01:45:15,580 --> 01:45:19,209
- I don't know if they make those. - We should make the first one.

1910
01:45:19,384 --> 01:45:22,319
I want the middle piece, so it'll be crooked on both sides.

1911
01:45:22,487 --> 01:45:26,389
I know we've gone over this, but, like, 1000 pardons, 1000 pardons, please.

1912
01:45:26,558 --> 01:45:29,288
- I fucked up... - I was a dick to you, man. I'm sorry.

1913
01:45:29,461 --> 01:45:31,986
I know I was an asshole. I hope I redeemed myself.

1914
01:45:32,164 --> 01:45:35,031
- I know me and you had our deal. - We've had some times.

1915
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:38,067
I feel like something's happening here. Is that a boner?

1916
01:45:38,236 --> 01:45:40,966
Is that a condo? That us moving into an apartment together?

1917
01:45:41,139 --> 01:45:42,697
Is that us getting a time-share?

1918
01:45:42,874 --> 01:45:45,274
- You threw an ashtray at his face. - You hit me, man.

1919
01:45:45,444 --> 01:45:47,810
At the time, I was like: But it was kind of funny.

1920
01:45:47,979 --> 01:45:50,539
You hit me with a DustBuster, man.

1921
01:45:50,716 --> 01:45:53,810
I didn't wanna hurt you. It was like, "You better not leave here."

1922
01:45:53,985 --> 01:45:55,976
- That was such a good fight, man. - That was.

1923
01:45:56,154 --> 01:45:57,621
You fuckhead.

1924
01:45:57,789 --> 01:46:00,349
- The car chase was awesome. - You got into a car chase?

1925
01:46:00,525 --> 01:46:03,119
- Are you kidding me? Oh, my God. - Yeah, it was...

1926
01:46:03,295 --> 01:46:06,230
I, like, had my foot through the window.

1927
01:46:06,398 --> 01:46:10,425
My groin... I mean, I felt like a wishbone.

1928
01:46:10,602 --> 01:46:12,536
I'm trying to decide how stoned I am...

1929
01:46:12,704 --> 01:46:14,899
...and just how on the verge of death am I now.

1930
01:46:15,073 --> 01:46:18,804
Am I seeing shit because I'm stoned or because I have no blood left?

1931
01:46:18,977 --> 01:46:21,844
- You've been shot, like, seven times. - You gotta eat.

1932
01:46:22,013 --> 01:46:23,776
- You're losing stuff. - Here.

1933
01:46:23,949 --> 01:46:25,814
- Here. - Yeah, okay.

1934
01:46:25,984 --> 01:46:29,442
- Here comes the airplane. - Look, like a baby.

1935
01:46:31,656 --> 01:46:34,124
It's a miracle. I think we should all take a moment...

1936
01:46:34,292 --> 01:46:36,852
...and think about what a miracle it is that we got out.

1937
01:46:37,028 --> 01:46:39,019
And that we became friends in the process...

1938
01:46:39,197 --> 01:46:41,427
...and learned some shit about life and stuff.

1939
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:45,832
Should we touch each other's hands while we do it? Okay.

1940
01:46:47,873 --> 01:46:49,306
I love you guys.

1941
01:46:49,474 --> 01:46:51,840
I love you dudes so much.

1942
01:46:54,746 --> 01:46:57,442
I'll remember that for the rest of my life.

1943
01:46:58,316 --> 01:46:59,749
- Red? - Red?

1944
01:46:59,918 --> 01:47:01,909
Yo, Red, man. You alive?

1945
01:47:02,087 --> 01:47:03,452
What's up, pal?

1946
01:47:04,356 --> 01:47:05,846
- Hey. - Hey.

1947
01:47:06,024 --> 01:47:09,721
I'm like the nerd at the sleepover who fell asleep at 9.

1948
01:47:09,895 --> 01:47:12,159
That's okay. We won't put our dicks in your mouth.

1949
01:47:12,330 --> 01:47:15,788
- Oh, God. - Hey, there's <i>bubbe.</i>

1950
01:47:15,967 --> 01:47:18,060
Come on. Let's get out of here.

1951
01:47:18,236 --> 01:47:20,170
Yeah, maybe we should go to the doctor.

1952
01:47:20,338 --> 01:47:22,431
Do you think she'll drive me to the hospital?

1953
01:47:22,607 --> 01:47:24,541
Me too. I should get the ear looked at.

1954
01:47:24,709 --> 01:47:26,973
My ear should probably get professional attention.

1955
01:47:27,145 --> 01:47:29,204
- It is bad. - That's a bullet burp.

1956
01:47:29,381 --> 01:47:32,407
Either I'm getting ready to die or I'm gonna take a massive shit.

1957
01:47:32,584 --> 01:47:34,449
If somebody could get me to the hospital.

1958
01:47:34,619 --> 01:47:36,211
Blood from my ear just...

1959
01:47:36,388 --> 01:47:39,186
You guys smell like shit.

1960
01:47:40,392 --> 01:47:43,054
You are in serious danger.
