1
00:01:16,113 --> 00:01:19,742
- When did it start?
- At 0500. We're seven minutes in.

2
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:29,583
Private Miller...

3
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,786
...you've been smoking Item 9
for seven minutes and 13 seconds.

4
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:35,007
We're going to ask
you several questions.

5
00:01:35,065 --> 00:01:36,089
How do you feel?

6
00:01:37,101 --> 00:01:38,500
Well, sir...

7
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:40,398
...I feel like a...

8
00:01:41,305 --> 00:01:43,637
Like a slice of butter...

9
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:50,211
...melting on top
of a big old pile of flapjacks.

10
00:01:52,816 --> 00:01:53,840
Yeah.

11
00:01:54,284 --> 00:01:57,378
Okay, Private Miller,
when you think of your superiors...

12
00:01:57,988 --> 00:02:00,422
...what emotions do you feel?

13
00:02:07,364 --> 00:02:09,093
Okay, Private Miller?

14
00:02:12,736 --> 00:02:13,760
Is this normal?

15
00:02:13,937 --> 00:02:15,598
Okay, Private...

16
00:02:16,673 --> 00:02:18,538
Okay, Private Miller?

17
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:20,301
Private Miller.

18
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,338
Answer the question.

19
00:02:31,522 --> 00:02:32,648
This went out, sir.

20
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:35,485
Can you torch me?

21
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,251
We'll send someone in.

22
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:40,589
Holy bejesus!

23
00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:49,137
Private Miller, answer the question.

24
00:02:49,306 --> 00:02:50,864
What was the question again, sir?

25
00:02:51,308 --> 00:02:55,472
When you think of your superiors,
what emotions do you feel?

26
00:02:55,812 --> 00:02:57,404
You know what problem I have...

27
00:02:57,581 --> 00:03:00,914
...with your fucking little
dog-and-pony act you call the military?

28
00:03:01,084 --> 00:03:04,451
Here it is. One: lots of dudes.

29
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:06,054
Where are the boobies?

30
00:03:06,223 --> 00:03:09,659
Two: Why are we
underground right now, sir?

31
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:13,023
Why can't we be out in the open?
Why aren't we in a square right now?

32
00:03:13,197 --> 00:03:16,496
Why aren't we talking to people,
letting them know Item 9 exists?

33
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:19,227
Get it out. Shout off the rooftops:

34
00:03:19,403 --> 00:03:23,897
"This is great!
This is the bee's knees, Item 9!"

35
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:25,735
Private, we need you to be serious.

36
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:29,640
I'm serious. Your dick, my mouth.

37
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,479
That's inappropriate.

38
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,784
Fuck you!

39
00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:48,625
I've seen enough. Shut it down.

40
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,394
Bury the hatch. Sell the land.
And dispose of him.

41
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:53,866
This never happened.

42
00:03:54,037 --> 00:03:55,664
Dude, what happened to your eye?

43
00:03:56,306 --> 00:03:57,898
Hello.

44
00:03:58,942 --> 00:04:00,239
Can you guys understand me?

45
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,277
- Hey. Hey, where we going?
- This is General Brat.

46
00:04:03,447 --> 00:04:06,211
We've reached
a final conclusion on Item 9.

47
00:04:06,717 --> 00:04:08,480
Illegal!

48
00:04:08,652 --> 00:04:09,676
<i>Hey, this is Sam. Good morning.</i>

49
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:11,447
<i>Welcome to KRAD.</i>

50
00:04:11,622 --> 00:04:14,557
<i>You know, I think that last caller</i>
<i>had some undeniable points.</i>

51
00:04:14,725 --> 00:04:17,421
<i>Right now, we're gonna get</i>
<i>to the next caller, Dale Denton.</i>

52
00:04:17,594 --> 00:04:19,494
Hey, Sam. Big huge fan.
First-time caller.

53
00:04:21,398 --> 00:04:22,990
- Here's my piece.
- <i>All right.</i>

54
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,896
If marijuana is not legal
within the next five years...

55
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:29,163
...I have no faith
left in humanity, period.

56
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,170
Everyone likes smoking weed.

57
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:34,777
They have for thousands of years.
They're not gonna stop anytime soon.

58
00:04:34,945 --> 00:04:37,106
<i>It makes everything better. Makes</i>
<i>food better. Makes music better.</i>

59
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:39,579
<i>It makes sex feel better,</i>
<i>for God's sakes.</i>

60
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,617
<i>It makes shitty movies better,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

61
00:04:51,528 --> 00:04:53,894
Hi, there. Are you Sandra Danby?

62
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:55,088
Yeah.

63
00:04:55,265 --> 00:04:59,895
Well, I'm Garth
from Global Saviors, and...

64
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,332
- What is this?
- I'm joking.

65
00:05:01,505 --> 00:05:03,700
You failed to show up
for divorce proceedings...

66
00:05:05,008 --> 00:05:07,670
...four times under court order,
and you've been served.

67
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:10,335
- Oh, great. Thanks a lot, asshole.
- Sorry.

68
00:05:10,514 --> 00:05:13,074
<i>I'm just saying love has no age.</i>

69
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,447
You can't instantly tell me that a man,
because he's a certain age...

70
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,588
...can't marry a woman
or love a woman.

71
00:05:18,755 --> 00:05:20,154
I'm dating a high-school girl.

72
00:05:20,324 --> 00:05:24,055
<i>You're not maximizing your potential.</i>
<i>Think this girl takes you seriously?</i>

73
00:05:24,227 --> 00:05:27,594
No, but if I'm 25
and the girl is 18 years old...

74
00:05:27,764 --> 00:05:29,823
...you know, in society,
that might look bad.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,094
- <i>Hey, as long as it's consensual.</i>
- I think it's consensual.

76
00:05:34,438 --> 00:05:36,235
Yo, you been served.

77
00:05:36,406 --> 00:05:39,842
You've been served.
You've been served.

78
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,069
You've been served.

79
00:05:49,386 --> 00:05:51,149
Walter Wadska the third.

80
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:53,687
You here to fix the fax machine?

81
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:57,088
No, I'm here to tell you
you owe MasterCard 4088 bucks.

82
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,626
You've been served by the best.
Keep it real.

83
00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:08,661
Why don't you get a real job,
you fucking cocksucker?

84
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:18,074
- Hey, "Electric Avenue."
- I know, right?

85
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:22,446
- Take that shit to the next level, eh?
- Okay, I will.

86
00:06:33,864 --> 00:06:36,492
- Dr. Edgar Terrence?
- Yes.

87
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,157
You have repeatedly refused
to trim the monkey tree...

88
00:06:39,336 --> 00:06:41,395
...that spills
onto your neighbor's property.

89
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:44,131
And now because of that,
you've been served.

90
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:45,365
You're a jerk.

91
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:47,567
All this current system is doing...

92
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:49,974
...is putting money
in the hands of criminals...

93
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:53,844
...and it's making ordinary people like
you and me deal with those criminals.

94
00:06:54,017 --> 00:06:57,475
You ever dealt with a drug dealer?
It's terrible, it's weird, it's awkward.

95
00:06:57,654 --> 00:06:59,645
They think they're your friend,
but they're not.

96
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:03,782
<i>Dale, I get your point. Thanks</i>
<i>for your input. Next caller, please.</i>

97
00:07:16,406 --> 00:07:18,203
I can't come.

98
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:20,565
What?

99
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:22,776
Why the fuck not, Dale?

100
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:24,243
I just... Look, I can't come.

101
00:07:24,414 --> 00:07:27,178
I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow.
It's a bad day for me.

102
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,513
Jesus Christ, Dale.
When were you gonna tell me?

103
00:07:30,687 --> 00:07:32,211
My mom has been shopping all day.

104
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:34,289
- Why?
- She's already planning on couscous.

105
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,427
I said I might be able to go,
so why is she doing that already?

106
00:07:37,594 --> 00:07:39,585
- Now I look like an asshole.
- You are one.

107
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:42,493
Come on, don't say that.
I just can't go. I have a job.

108
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,099
- Fine.
- "Fine"?

109
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:45,734
Don't come. I don't care.

110
00:07:45,902 --> 00:07:49,201
Then why have you been inviting me?
I thought you wanted me to go.

111
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:51,636
If you don't wanna meet them,
I don't want you to.

112
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:55,403
I want to. I can't. I have a job.
I'm sorry. What do you want from me?

113
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:58,070
I just know they'll like you, that's all.

114
00:07:58,248 --> 00:08:00,409
You're great, and you're funny...

115
00:08:00,584 --> 00:08:02,484
...and you're sexy.

116
00:08:02,886 --> 00:08:05,081
I just want them to see that.

117
00:08:05,255 --> 00:08:07,917
- You want them to see that I'm sexy?
- Hey, people?

118
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:09,649
- Hi, Mr. Edwards.
- Can I help you?

119
00:08:09,826 --> 00:08:11,817
No, I'm good. Thank you, though.

120
00:08:11,995 --> 00:08:14,987
Yeah? I see you don't have
a visitor's badge. That's why I ask.

121
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:18,134
- I'm with her, actually.
- Actually, this is my boyfriend.

122
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:22,600
I heard that. I wish I didn't hear that,
but I just heard that.

123
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:24,103
What's that supposed to mean?

124
00:08:24,274 --> 00:08:27,903
I'm just wondering why you don't
date a nice guy your own age.

125
00:08:28,078 --> 00:08:30,046
- She's very mature for her age.
- Yeah.

126
00:08:30,213 --> 00:08:31,771
- Angie, hey. How's it going?
- Hey.

127
00:08:31,948 --> 00:08:34,007
Hey, Clark, how you doing, man?
What's up?

128
00:08:34,184 --> 00:08:36,948
I'm good, bro. I'm good.

129
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,747
Dude, I wanted to tell you.

130
00:08:38,922 --> 00:08:40,787
You were hilarious today
in drama class.

131
00:08:40,957 --> 00:08:43,517
Your Jeff Goldblum impression
made me pee my pants.

132
00:08:44,127 --> 00:08:45,185
I wish.

133
00:08:46,096 --> 00:08:47,927
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

134
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:50,623
Last week when we worked out,
you forgot your shorts in my car.

135
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,165
Oh, yeah.

136
00:08:52,335 --> 00:08:53,768
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

137
00:08:53,937 --> 00:08:55,336
Yeah, no problem, no problem.

138
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:56,972
- Can you hold those?
- Yeah.

139
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,199
- Yeah.
- How's it going, Sporty Spice?

140
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:00,638
This is my boyfriend, Dale.

141
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,277
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- You too.

142
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:04,572
I've heard so much about you.
You're real cool.

143
00:09:04,748 --> 00:09:06,978
- I mean, you're great. Yeah.
- Yeah, awesome.

144
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,950
Anyways, yeah, dude, next year.
Next year college, man. College.

145
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:13,385
Gonna be kick-ass.
I will watch her back for you.

146
00:09:13,557 --> 00:09:17,493
I know there's tons of guys that are
gonna be trying to get on that shit.

147
00:09:17,661 --> 00:09:19,561
- Oh, good.
- Because I got that... Yeah.

148
00:09:19,729 --> 00:09:21,356
You got her ass? Perfect.

149
00:09:21,531 --> 00:09:24,398
- I'll watch her ass for...
- He's trying to be nice.

150
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:26,661
- I'll catch you at Home Ec.
- Okay.

151
00:09:26,836 --> 00:09:28,963
You guys got Home Ec
together too. That's cool.

152
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:31,403
- We got a few classes together.
- Nice to meet you.

153
00:09:31,575 --> 00:09:35,409
Time to suck today's dick. That's what
I'm talking about. See you guys later.

154
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:37,479
- All right, Clark.
- Clark's a great guy.

155
00:09:37,647 --> 00:09:39,706
He's totally gonna take care
of Angela, man.

156
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:43,046
He's great. He's a wonderful
lab partner. He'll keep an eye on her.

157
00:09:43,219 --> 00:09:45,483
Why don't you go fuck yourself,
you weird prick?

158
00:09:45,655 --> 00:09:47,748
I'm a teacher.
You can't talk to me like that.

159
00:09:47,924 --> 00:09:50,188
I'm not a student,
so I can say whatever I want...

160
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,624
...you chimp-fucking little bastard.
- Actually...

161
00:09:52,796 --> 00:09:55,560
You've got T-minus 30 seconds
to get off school property...

162
00:09:55,732 --> 00:09:57,427
...or I call the liaison officer.

163
00:09:57,601 --> 00:10:00,729
- We're leaving. I'm sorry.
- Middle finger won't stop the clock.

164
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:01,928
What a jerk.

165
00:10:02,105 --> 00:10:03,834
What's that guy's problem? Jesus.

166
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:07,033
I don't... Normally he's...
That's really weird.

167
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,202
I'd love to have dinner with you
and your parents tomorrow night.

168
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,247
I'm gonna go. I'll definitely go.
I'll shuffle things around...

169
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,316
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll be there for sure.

170
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:17,851
Yeah, I wanna show them
you're in good hands. Yeah.

171
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:19,750
I got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

172
00:10:19,923 --> 00:10:21,754
That means so much to me
and my parents.

173
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:24,917
No problem.
It's gonna be awesome.

174
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:29,121
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Saul. Mind if I come by?

175
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:32,291
- <i>Come on down.</i>
- Sweet. Be there.

176
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:34,164
- <i>Hi, Mary.</i>
- <i>Hi.</i>

177
00:10:34,337 --> 00:10:36,931
<i>I thought the hurricane season</i>
<i>was over.</i>

178
00:10:37,107 --> 00:10:38,768
I thought hurricane season
was over.

179
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:40,739
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Things just got out of hand.</i>

180
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,276
<i>Yeah, that's the way it was</i>
<i>with my first husband.</i>

181
00:10:46,716 --> 00:10:48,149
Hello? Hey, man.

182
00:10:48,318 --> 00:10:50,081
What the fuck, man?

183
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:52,881
I didn't buzz you in.
How the monkey did you get in here?

184
00:10:53,056 --> 00:10:56,219
Some guy with a fauxhawk let me in.
He was leaving when l...

185
00:10:56,393 --> 00:10:58,486
- Fucking Kyle.
- It might have been Kyle.

186
00:10:58,662 --> 00:11:00,289
- Asshole.
- I'm sorry, man.

187
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:02,522
What the fuck's
the buzzer for anyway?

188
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:06,157
I don't know. I'm sorry about that.
I don't know your protocol yet.

189
00:11:06,336 --> 00:11:08,600
Stuff your sorries in a sack.
It's not your fault.

190
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:11,741
- Okay.
- It's these jerk-offs. Have a seat.

191
00:11:11,908 --> 00:11:13,899
Okay, cool.
Thanks, man. Awesome.

192
00:11:14,077 --> 00:11:16,272
Yo, check this out.

193
00:11:18,615 --> 00:11:21,345
Satellite radio.

194
00:11:21,518 --> 00:11:24,487
Got two TVs and radio.
That's pretty rad.

195
00:11:24,654 --> 00:11:25,951
That's home entertainment.

196
00:11:26,122 --> 00:11:29,319
You're very entertained.
Oh, wow. You got a cute picture too.

197
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:31,619
Oh, yeah. Me and my <i>bubbe.</i>

198
00:11:32,095 --> 00:11:33,687
Hey, let me ask you something.

199
00:11:33,863 --> 00:11:35,194
Yeah?

200
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:39,591
Do you think you could pull the plug
on someone if you needed to?

201
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:41,828
Like, euthanasia?

202
00:11:43,973 --> 00:11:45,998
Like, on her?

203
00:11:46,176 --> 00:11:48,007
If I needed to.

204
00:11:52,682 --> 00:11:53,979
I'm kind of in a hurry, man.

205
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,812
I don't know if we should
start going down that road.

206
00:11:56,986 --> 00:11:59,955
I could talk all day about euthanasia.
Don't get me started.

207
00:12:00,123 --> 00:12:01,647
- Maybe we should...
- We'll save it.

208
00:12:01,825 --> 00:12:04,157
- Save it for next time.
- I'll take that rain check.

209
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:05,760
Business for the businessman.

210
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:08,022
- Yeah, you got my number.
- Okay.

211
00:12:08,198 --> 00:12:09,631
- Brass tacks.
- Yes.

212
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:13,200
Just got a shipment
of the dopest dope I've ever smoked.

213
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:15,234
Hands down,
dopest dope I've ever smoked.

214
00:12:15,405 --> 00:12:18,499
Not better than the Blue Oyster.
It can't be. I can't handle that.

215
00:12:18,675 --> 00:12:23,339
This is like if that Blue Oyster shit
met that Afghan Kush I had...

216
00:12:23,513 --> 00:12:24,980
...and they had a baby.

217
00:12:25,148 --> 00:12:27,981
And meanwhile, that crazy
Northern Lights stuff I had...

218
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:31,814
...and the Super Red Especial
Snowflake met and had a baby.

219
00:12:31,988 --> 00:12:35,424
And by some miracle,
those two babies met and fucked...

220
00:12:35,592 --> 00:12:38,823
...this would be the shit
that they birthed.

221
00:12:38,995 --> 00:12:41,327
- Yes.
- This is the product of baby fucking.

222
00:12:41,498 --> 00:12:42,795
- Smell it.
- Okay.

223
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:45,264
Smell it. Enjoy.

224
00:12:45,435 --> 00:12:48,632
It's like God's vagina.

225
00:12:50,206 --> 00:12:51,605
What, you wanna bathe in it?

226
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:53,675
- I wanna live in here.
- You wanna be it?

227
00:12:53,843 --> 00:12:56,971
My God, I just wanna shove it
up my nose, have that smell all day.

228
00:12:57,147 --> 00:12:59,206
- That's amazing.
- Shove it anywhere you like.

229
00:12:59,382 --> 00:13:00,679
Beautiful. What's it called?

230
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,943
- Pineapple Express.
- Pineapple Express.

231
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:05,110
It's this thing, like, El Niño.

232
00:13:05,288 --> 00:13:08,280
This airflow that comes
from Hawaii and Canada.

233
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,359
It gets the dirt, mixes it in
with the weed in a special way.

234
00:13:11,528 --> 00:13:13,860
It's very scientific.
I won't go into it right now.

235
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,692
But I am the only guy
in the whole city that has it.

236
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:18,424
Only 10 bones more for a quarter.

237
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:20,296
Okay, I'll take a quarter.

238
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,461
- All right, you're on.
- Thank you very much.

239
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,970
Let me get my scale.

240
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,541
Get it going. Grab the scale.
Let's get me out of here.

241
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:31,512
I thought hurricane season
was over.

242
00:13:32,415 --> 00:13:34,747
Oh, crow.

243
00:13:36,986 --> 00:13:39,887
Where are you, you little fucker?

244
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,522
What the fuck is this thing?

245
00:13:45,762 --> 00:13:47,161
- Cross joint.
- Yeah.

246
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,696
- You ever smoke one of those?
- You can smoke this?

247
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:50,924
- Yeah, man.
- No.

248
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,193
This is the future.

249
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:58,170
This is, like, the apex
of the vortex of joint engineering.

250
00:13:58,341 --> 00:14:01,606
It's rumored that M. M. O'Shaughnessy
designed the first one.

251
00:14:01,778 --> 00:14:04,338
The guy who designed
the Golden Gate Bridge.

252
00:14:04,514 --> 00:14:06,778
My second favorite civil engineer...

253
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,818
...behind Hannskarl Bandel,
Madison Square Garden.

254
00:14:10,987 --> 00:14:14,787
What you do is you light all three ends
at the same time.

255
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,223
- Really?
- And then the smoke converges...

256
00:14:18,394 --> 00:14:22,455
...creating a trifecta
of joint-smoking power.

257
00:14:22,632 --> 00:14:25,863
This is it, man. This is what your
grandchildren are gonna be smoking.

258
00:14:26,035 --> 00:14:28,026
Future. The future.

259
00:14:28,204 --> 00:14:30,764
That's amazing.
Well, got the weed?

260
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,841
- Yeah.
- In the bag. Beautiful. Okay.

261
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,946
Be careful with that thing, man.
Here's the cash, grab the stash.

262
00:14:38,114 --> 00:14:39,877
Alrighty, man, thanks.
Have a good one.

263
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:41,846
Don't hurt yourself. Adios.

264
00:14:42,018 --> 00:14:44,145
Well, hey, wait a minute, man.

265
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,049
Let's smoke this fucking thing.

266
00:14:46,222 --> 00:14:48,053
I really... I can't, man. I gotta...

267
00:14:48,224 --> 00:14:50,351
I can't even light this thing
on my own.

268
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,460
I need your help, man.

269
00:14:54,063 --> 00:14:55,894
- I'm in.
- Come on!

270
00:14:56,065 --> 00:14:58,863
- Why not? Let's do it.
- Come on down!

271
00:14:59,035 --> 00:15:00,900
Why not? What do I do?

272
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,230
Okay, here's what you do.

273
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:04,134
- You equip yourself.
- I'm equipping.

274
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:05,706
- Equip me, sir.
- Okay.

275
00:15:06,643 --> 00:15:10,739
You are going to light these two ends
while I light this end.

276
00:15:10,914 --> 00:15:12,677
- Okay.
- Are you ready?

277
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:15,716
- Ready.
- Blast off.

278
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:34,428
- I'm gonna do it.
- Good. Go for it.

279
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:47,978
It's better to cough.

280
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:49,675
It's like...

281
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:51,444
Makes you 10 times more higher...

282
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:53,885
...than the cross weed
and the Pineapple Express.

283
00:15:54,057 --> 00:15:57,857
You're like,
totally fucking <i>Gong Show'ed,</i> man.

284
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:12,206
Oh, fuck.

285
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,842
Hang on one second, man.

286
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,034
Oh, you fucker.

287
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:21,211
Who is it?

288
00:16:21,384 --> 00:16:23,215
<i>It's Chris Gebert, man. Let me up.</i>

289
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:24,580
Shit.

290
00:16:24,988 --> 00:16:26,319
What's a Gebert?

291
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:28,081
Come on up.

292
00:16:28,257 --> 00:16:31,590
He ain't getting any
of that Pineapple Express.

293
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:36,130
Chris is getting Snicklefritz.

294
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:39,433
Hey.

295
00:16:39,602 --> 00:16:41,593
So listen, man.

296
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:44,171
I gotta ask you. So...

297
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:48,299
Listen, man. You've been buying
from me for, like, two months, right?

298
00:16:48,478 --> 00:16:50,776
- Two months.
- I gotta ask, man.

299
00:16:50,947 --> 00:16:52,471
What's up with the suit?

300
00:16:52,648 --> 00:16:55,446
I'm a process server.
So I have to wear a suit.

301
00:16:55,618 --> 00:16:59,987
Wow, you're a servant?
Like a butler?

302
00:17:00,156 --> 00:17:03,387
- A chauffeur?
- No. No. What? No, I'm not...

303
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:06,619
- Shine shoes?
- I'm a process server.

304
00:17:06,796 --> 00:17:08,286
- I like...
- In process.

305
00:17:08,464 --> 00:17:10,432
I work for a company
that's, like, hired...

306
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,591
...by lawyers to hand out
legal documents.

307
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:14,896
Like subpoenas to people
who don't want them.

308
00:17:15,071 --> 00:17:18,871
I gotta wear disguises sometimes just to
make them admit they're themselves...

309
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:21,306
...so I can serve them the papers.

310
00:17:21,477 --> 00:17:22,501
Disguise.

311
00:17:22,678 --> 00:17:23,804
Kind of, I guess.

312
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,005
- It's a hell of a job.
- That's cool, man.

313
00:17:26,182 --> 00:17:30,346
Like a day-to-day basis, it's fine.
Like today, I, like, sat in my car...

314
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,987
...I smoked, like, 10 doobies...

315
00:17:32,155 --> 00:17:34,646
...and then I went to go visit
my girlfriend at lunch.

316
00:17:34,824 --> 00:17:36,451
Nice.

317
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:39,060
What? You sucked on her titties?

318
00:17:39,228 --> 00:17:42,288
No, I just kissed her.
I just did that to make it seem cool.

319
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:44,956
That's cool.
Does she like to smoke weed?

320
00:17:45,134 --> 00:17:47,227
A little sometimes.
She has a couple...

321
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:50,167
She's in high school,
so as much as any high-school kid.

322
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:52,170
She's cool as hell, actually.

323
00:17:52,341 --> 00:17:54,070
- You'd get along with her.
- Really?

324
00:17:54,243 --> 00:17:56,973
Yeah, you know, it only sucks...

325
00:17:57,146 --> 00:18:00,877
...when I go visit her in high school
and the guys she goes to school with...

326
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,484
...are strong and handsome
and really funny.

327
00:18:03,653 --> 00:18:06,520
Like, do good impressions
of Jeff Goldblum and shit like that.

328
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:11,683
And, like, I just feel like a fat, dumb,
fucking stinky ass-turd when I'm there.

329
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:14,056
- What?
- It really... It sucks for my ego.

330
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,596
- Fuck Jeff Goldblum, man.
- That's what I say.

331
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:19,462
You know, don't get down on yourself.
You got a great girl.

332
00:18:19,635 --> 00:18:22,035
You got a great job
where you don't do anything.

333
00:18:22,205 --> 00:18:24,332
You get to smoke weed all day.

334
00:18:24,507 --> 00:18:25,872
I wish I had that.

335
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:29,375
Are you kidd...? You do.
You have the easiest job on Earth.

336
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:32,605
- You do smoke weed all day.
- That's true.

337
00:18:32,782 --> 00:18:35,250
You didn't think of that.

338
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:37,477
- I do have a good job.
- Yeah, you do nothing.

339
00:18:37,653 --> 00:18:38,881
- Thanks, man.
- No prob.

340
00:18:39,055 --> 00:18:40,682
Thank you.

341
00:18:40,857 --> 00:18:43,985
Oh, shit. All right. Business.

342
00:18:45,094 --> 00:18:46,959
- Got my persona.
- Yeah, yeah.

343
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,620
Hey. Put that cross joint out.

344
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:51,232
He sees that, he'll never
get the fuck out of here.

345
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:54,593
- What's up, Chris?
- Yo, hey, Saul.

346
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,101
- Hey.
- How you doing, buddy?

347
00:18:56,272 --> 00:18:57,569
All right, homes. Good.

348
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,867
- Who's this?
- Hey. Oh, that's my friend Mark.

349
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:02,010
You got the dough? There you go.

350
00:19:02,178 --> 00:19:04,305
- Appreciate it.
- Nice. Good to meet you, Mark.

351
00:19:04,814 --> 00:19:06,873
- Do you have any Percocet, please?
- Percocet?

352
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:09,381
What are you talking about?
I don't sell that shit.

353
00:19:09,552 --> 00:19:10,576
- Chris.
- Chris.

354
00:19:10,753 --> 00:19:12,516
You told him I was
gonna sell Percocet?

355
00:19:12,688 --> 00:19:15,179
- I didn't say anything about Percocet.
- What the fuck?

356
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:17,553
- I just wanted a couple Percocets.
- Well, I...

357
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:19,627
You came to the wrong place.
Wrong place.

358
00:19:19,795 --> 00:19:22,662
- Sorry.
- Yeah, nice. Peace out, homes.

359
00:19:22,832 --> 00:19:24,094
- Thank...
- God.

360
00:19:24,267 --> 00:19:26,258
- What the fuck?
- Yeah.

361
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:28,266
- Fucking lingerer.
- Yeah, totally.

362
00:19:28,437 --> 00:19:29,802
- Lingerer.
- Hardcore.

363
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:31,462
Fuck.

364
00:19:32,408 --> 00:19:34,205
- Bums me out.
- Bums me out too.

365
00:19:34,377 --> 00:19:37,972
If there's one quality
I hate in a person, it's lingering.

366
00:19:38,147 --> 00:19:40,843
- That's right. You and me both.
- Yeah, yeah.

367
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:44,282
So I'm curious. What have
those people done that you go...

368
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:46,512
...and process and service?

369
00:19:46,689 --> 00:19:49,214
I don't know. It's always
something different, I guess.

370
00:19:49,392 --> 00:19:50,654
This guy...

371
00:19:50,826 --> 00:19:53,522
Ted Jones, who knows. You know?

372
00:19:53,696 --> 00:19:55,960
- Ted Jones?
- Yeah, why?

373
00:19:56,132 --> 00:19:59,932
My guy, Red, who I buy from,
he gets his stuff from a Ted Jones.

374
00:20:00,102 --> 00:20:02,002
- Really?
- Maybe it's the same guy.

375
00:20:02,171 --> 00:20:03,195
That'd be weird.

376
00:20:03,372 --> 00:20:05,932
It's a pretty normal name,
I guess, but...

377
00:20:06,108 --> 00:20:09,635
Anyway, I should really
get going, man. I gotta go.

378
00:20:09,812 --> 00:20:12,144
Duty calls, but it's good to see you.
Thanks.

379
00:20:12,315 --> 00:20:14,943
You're gonna smoke and run?
Come on, man.

380
00:20:15,117 --> 00:20:18,211
We can go look at some crazy things
on the Internet together.

381
00:20:18,387 --> 00:20:21,515
That sounds appealing,
but you know what? I'll tell... Here...

382
00:20:21,691 --> 00:20:24,626
I'm gonna run out of weed in
a couple days. I'll come by, hang out.

383
00:20:24,794 --> 00:20:27,558
- We'll watch <i>227</i> and shit.
- Definitely.

384
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,630
Cool, man. Well, thanks.
Good to see you.

385
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:30,959
- Peace, brother.
- Okay.

386
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:32,623
One love.

387
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:34,863
<i>When you got behind</i>
<i>on the mortgage...</i>

388
00:20:35,037 --> 00:20:36,834
<i>... someone finally</i>
<i>made you a loan?</i>

389
00:20:37,006 --> 00:20:38,098
<i>Yes, he did.</i>

390
00:20:38,274 --> 00:20:40,868
<i>Yes, he did.</i>
<i>What was the interest rate you got?</i>

391
00:20:41,043 --> 00:20:45,639
- <i>It was 12 or 13 percent.</i>
- <i>That's disgusting.</i>

392
00:20:55,324 --> 00:20:57,155
- Hello?
- <i>Hello.</i>

393
00:20:57,326 --> 00:20:58,953
Hey, Angie, what's happening?

394
00:20:59,128 --> 00:21:02,586
<i>I just talked to my mom, and they are</i>
<i>so excited you're coming for dinner.</i>

395
00:21:02,765 --> 00:21:05,893
<i>Like, so excited. And so am I,</i>
<i>but we're all really excited.</i>

396
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:07,092
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

397
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,602
No problem. I'm psyched too.
It's gonna be awesome.

398
00:21:09,772 --> 00:21:13,435
Couscous. The food so nice,
they named it twice.

399
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:18,311
<i>Dale, anyway, I can't wait</i>
<i>for next year when this bullshit's over.</i>

400
00:21:18,481 --> 00:21:21,382
Oh, shit. I see the guy I gotta serve.
I'll call you back.

401
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,484
Fucking cops. Shit.

402
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,390
Jesus.

403
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:39,591
What an adorable little cop.

404
00:21:40,102 --> 00:21:41,694
Weird.

405
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:48,099
Jesus. Fuck.

406
00:21:48,277 --> 00:21:50,302
What the fuck was that?

407
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:51,741
Oh, shit.

408
00:21:52,815 --> 00:21:55,579
Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude.

409
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:56,775
Oh, no!

410
00:22:08,931 --> 00:22:11,923
- Drive, drive.
- Who the fuck is that?

411
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:14,092
I don't know,
but I ain't waiting to see.

412
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:46,025
Pineapple Express.

413
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,131
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

414
00:22:50,306 --> 00:22:51,796
I saw brains and blood!

415
00:22:51,974 --> 00:22:53,441
Come on! Come on!

416
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:54,667
Where do I go?

417
00:23:11,093 --> 00:23:12,117
Hello?

418
00:23:12,294 --> 00:23:14,023
Saul, it's Dale.
Let me in. Let me in.

419
00:23:14,196 --> 00:23:16,664
I just saw some crazy shit.
Please. Let me in.

420
00:23:16,832 --> 00:23:19,630
- <i>It's Dale Denton. Let me in, man.</i>
- Dale?

421
00:23:19,802 --> 00:23:22,430
<i>Yes, Dale. That's what I said.</i>
<i>It's Dale. Let me in.</i>

422
00:23:22,605 --> 00:23:24,664
Oh, all right, man. Come on up.

423
00:23:28,677 --> 00:23:30,838
I buzzed it. Open the door
when I buzz it.

424
00:23:31,013 --> 00:23:32,844
<i>Buzz it in three seconds exactly.</i>

425
00:23:33,015 --> 00:23:35,483
One, two...

426
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:37,676
- Did it work?
- On three!

427
00:23:37,853 --> 00:23:40,686
I did it on three.
On "one, two, three, go"?

428
00:23:40,856 --> 00:23:42,619
<i>Just on three.</i>

429
00:23:52,868 --> 00:23:55,200
- He fucking killed him.
- Hey, I got neighbors.

430
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:56,838
He fucking killed him.

431
00:23:57,006 --> 00:23:59,975
- Who killed who?
- A cop. A lady and a guy.

432
00:24:00,142 --> 00:24:03,236
A cop, a lady and a guy?
That's a massacre. You saw it?

433
00:24:03,412 --> 00:24:05,437
No, it was just a guy.

434
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:07,275
- What happened to the lady?
- No. No.

435
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:12,114
A woman. A policewoman and a guy,
another guy, shot another guy...

436
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:15,280
...an Asian guy, in the window,
at fucking Ted's house.

437
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,016
Whoa, was the other guy Ted?

438
00:24:17,193 --> 00:24:19,286
I don't know.
He was a big, gray-haired man...

439
00:24:19,462 --> 00:24:21,191
...and he had a robe
and he shot him.

440
00:24:21,363 --> 00:24:24,298
And his brain flew every...
I'm gonna be... I'm gonna throw up.

441
00:24:24,467 --> 00:24:25,900
What?

442
00:24:27,002 --> 00:24:29,368
- That was chicken fries.
- Sick.

443
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:30,937
You threw up on my printer.

444
00:24:31,106 --> 00:24:32,471
- I did.
- Did you break it?

445
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:34,541
- I hope not.
- Listen, man.

446
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,200
I think the guy was Ted.

447
00:24:36,378 --> 00:24:38,209
And the Asians
are number-two in town...

448
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,314
...so you saw Ted
capping the competition.

449
00:24:40,483 --> 00:24:42,280
They saw me
seeing them shoot the guy.

450
00:24:42,451 --> 00:24:44,112
What? They saw you?

451
00:24:44,286 --> 00:24:45,651
And you fucking came here?

452
00:24:45,821 --> 00:24:47,789
- Did they follow you here?
- I don't know.

453
00:24:47,957 --> 00:24:52,223
- Did they follow you here?
- I don't know. Look. Look. Okay.

454
00:24:53,762 --> 00:24:55,093
I saw them kill him.

455
00:24:55,264 --> 00:24:57,994
I freaked out. I panicked, okay?

456
00:24:58,167 --> 00:25:00,294
I tossed my roach.

457
00:25:00,469 --> 00:25:02,937
- I crashed into two cars.
- Yeah.

458
00:25:03,105 --> 00:25:06,233
So they must have heard...
They know someone was out there.

459
00:25:06,408 --> 00:25:08,535
- They know someone saw.
- They know "someone."

460
00:25:08,711 --> 00:25:11,339
They don't know it was you. Right?

461
00:25:11,514 --> 00:25:14,915
I don't... I mean, yeah. I don't know.

462
00:25:15,084 --> 00:25:16,642
- Yes.
- I hope not.

463
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:17,877
Relax.

464
00:25:18,053 --> 00:25:22,820
Just sit back. Get ready to enjoy some
of the rarest weed known to mankind.

465
00:25:25,294 --> 00:25:26,852
Is it really that rare?

466
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,355
It's, like, the rarest.

467
00:25:30,332 --> 00:25:31,993
It's almost a shame to smoke it.

468
00:25:32,768 --> 00:25:36,135
It's like killing a unicorn...

469
00:25:36,305 --> 00:25:38,034
...with, like, a bomb.

470
00:25:39,842 --> 00:25:42,470
Are you the only guy in town
who has this?

471
00:25:42,645 --> 00:25:44,772
- You're actually the only guy?
- Yeah.

472
00:25:44,947 --> 00:25:48,542
My guy Red said he was giving me
an exclusive sneak preview.

473
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:51,777
I'm the only guy you sold it to?
The other guys got Snicklefritz?

474
00:25:51,954 --> 00:25:55,048
Yeah. So we're, like, the only guys.

475
00:25:55,224 --> 00:25:57,021
And Red got this from Ted?

476
00:25:57,192 --> 00:25:58,523
Ted's the man.

477
00:25:59,228 --> 00:26:02,254
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go!

478
00:26:02,431 --> 00:26:04,763
I threw a roach of this
outside of Ted's house.

479
00:26:04,934 --> 00:26:06,925
So what? I throw roaches
all over town.

480
00:26:07,102 --> 00:26:10,503
No. He could find the roach
and say, "It's Pineapple Express.

481
00:26:10,673 --> 00:26:12,868
Saul is the only guy
who has Pineapple Express.

482
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:15,135
He must have seen the murder!
Let's kill him!"

483
00:26:15,311 --> 00:26:16,744
- Let's get out of here!
- Fuck!

484
00:26:16,912 --> 00:26:19,710
Wait! Stop!
Get weed! Get the weed!

485
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:23,079
Anything we might need.
Snacks, food, Fruit Roll-Ups.

486
00:26:23,252 --> 00:26:25,345
- Let's get the fuck out of here!
- Okay, okay.

487
00:26:44,406 --> 00:26:46,601
Red said he'd be here.

488
00:26:54,216 --> 00:26:56,548
Them some drugs.

489
00:26:58,721 --> 00:27:00,279
Smells like vomit in this house.

490
00:27:00,456 --> 00:27:02,356
Want a hit, man? It's still lit.

491
00:27:02,524 --> 00:27:04,685
I'm having dinner with my wife.
She can tell.

492
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,521
Smell it on my sweater.

493
00:27:06,695 --> 00:27:08,128
For real?

494
00:27:08,297 --> 00:27:09,594
Yeah, for real.

495
00:27:09,765 --> 00:27:12,563
You wanna wear my vest?
It smell good.

496
00:27:12,735 --> 00:27:13,793
Not my style.

497
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:16,335
You ain't got no style, motherfucker.

498
00:27:16,505 --> 00:27:18,939
<i>You have reached</i>
<i>the voice mailbox of...</i>

499
00:27:19,108 --> 00:27:20,735
- <i>Ted.</i>
- Ted, it's Budlofsky.

500
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:23,707
- We're here. Saul's gone.
- And Mathe...

501
00:27:25,247 --> 00:27:27,909
- And Matheson.
- I think he knew we were coming.

502
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:29,209
They not here, Ted.

503
00:27:29,385 --> 00:27:31,080
Hi, Ted.

504
00:27:31,687 --> 00:27:33,951
Okay, what do you know
about Ted?

505
00:27:34,123 --> 00:27:35,886
I think he's crazy about murdering.

506
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:38,253
Well, that's not good.
Where are we gonna go?

507
00:27:38,427 --> 00:27:42,295
Let's just go... Go to a motel or a hotel
and just hide out.

508
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:46,059
The police were in on it. Could have
flagged credit cards. They'll find us.

509
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:50,230
Shit. I wish we could
just go nowhere.

510
00:27:52,408 --> 00:27:53,568
Okay.

511
00:27:53,742 --> 00:27:59,442
Even if he found that roach,
how could he know where you are?

512
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:02,747
Heat-seeking missiles.

513
00:28:04,453 --> 00:28:05,579
Bloodhounds.

514
00:28:06,655 --> 00:28:08,179
Foxes.

515
00:28:08,357 --> 00:28:09,984
Barracudas.

516
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,356
I'm kind of flabbergasted when
you say things like that. It's weird.

517
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:14,553
Thank you.

518
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,755
Not a compliment.
Here's the question.

519
00:28:16,932 --> 00:28:18,866
Let's say he actually
found the roach.

520
00:28:19,034 --> 00:28:23,232
How could he connect
the Pineapple Express weed to you?

521
00:28:23,405 --> 00:28:26,738
He can't, man.
Only fucking Red knows.

522
00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:28,774
Only Red knows, man.

523
00:28:28,944 --> 00:28:30,377
Who is Red?

524
00:28:30,546 --> 00:28:34,209
Red's, like, the middleman
between, like, Ted and me.

525
00:28:34,383 --> 00:28:36,442
And we're, like,
mad fucking tight, man.

526
00:28:36,618 --> 00:28:38,711
One time, he got this girl...

527
00:28:38,887 --> 00:28:42,288
...to give me a hand job, like,
within five minutes of meeting her.

528
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:47,020
It was like, "I don't
even know your name, whoa."

529
00:28:47,396 --> 00:28:52,356
That is pretty rad, but, like,
let's say Ted calls him and is like:

530
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:54,661
"Did you sell the Pineapple Express
to anyone?"

531
00:28:54,837 --> 00:28:57,465
He'll be, "Yeah, I sold it to Saul."
Why wouldn't he?

532
00:28:57,639 --> 00:29:00,335
No. Oh, no. Fuck that, man.

533
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:04,104
Fucking hand job, Dale.
Imagine if I gave you a hand job.

534
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:08,113
- Why would I wanna do that?
- No, I mean if I got you a hand job.

535
00:29:08,283 --> 00:29:10,751
The same rules don't apply to Red.
He's a drug dealer.

536
00:29:12,755 --> 00:29:16,521
I'm a drug dealer.
Are you saying you don't trust me?

537
00:29:17,326 --> 00:29:19,817
No, that's not at all what I'm...
You know what?

538
00:29:19,995 --> 00:29:23,954
You know? Just ignore what I said.
Call him. Give him a call.

539
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,760
See what the dealio is.

540
00:29:29,471 --> 00:29:31,268
- Hello.
- <i>Hey, Red, you okay?</i>

541
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,534
<i>Yeah, Saul. Yeah, I'm fine, man.</i>
<i>I just stubbed my toe.</i>

542
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,702
Be careful, man. Be careful.
Wear shoes in the house.

543
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,906
Safety. Safety first, then teamwork.
Now, listen.

544
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:43,574
You know that Pineapple Express stuff
you gave me?

545
00:29:43,752 --> 00:29:46,380
Don't tell anybody
that you sold it to me.

546
00:29:46,555 --> 00:29:47,852
I'd never talk to anyone...

547
00:29:48,023 --> 00:29:52,255
...about the stuff that I do with you
involving drugs.

548
00:29:52,427 --> 00:29:54,918
All right, cool.
Listen, I'm gonna come by.

549
00:29:55,097 --> 00:29:56,928
I gotta lay some shit on you.

550
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:58,691
There is a fly in the ointment.

551
00:29:58,867 --> 00:30:01,427
Shit has hit the fan.
The lion will speak.

552
00:30:01,603 --> 00:30:03,901
- I'm in the middle of a convo.
- No, seriously.

553
00:30:04,072 --> 00:30:06,563
- We're gonna be there in half an hour.
- <i>Perfect.</i>

554
00:30:06,742 --> 00:30:09,734
- No, please. No, no, no.
- Let's go over there and chill out.

555
00:30:09,912 --> 00:30:12,380
No, can we go tomorrow?
Look, we're already here...

556
00:30:12,548 --> 00:30:14,982
There's somebody else
on the phone with him.

557
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,174
- Who?
- I don't know.

558
00:30:16,351 --> 00:30:17,978
He's whispering to another man.

559
00:30:18,153 --> 00:30:20,986
We'll go in the morning.
It's better that way.

560
00:30:21,156 --> 00:30:24,648
- Okay.
- Yes. Yes. Thank you. Yes.

561
00:30:24,827 --> 00:30:27,227
- <i>Hey.</i>
- So you're coming by tomorrow?

562
00:30:27,396 --> 00:30:28,454
How'd you know that?

563
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,498
Heard you whispering to that other guy
that you were talking to. Who is that?

564
00:30:32,668 --> 00:30:35,364
Right, Dale. Good job.
Listen, I can't go in the morning...

565
00:30:35,537 --> 00:30:38,267
...because my <i>bubbe...</i> Gotta change
her clocks. Daylight-savings.

566
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,965
Is that the <i>bubbe</i>
that's on 41 st and River Street?

567
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:43,543
The one where we played
shuffleboard that one time?

568
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:46,340
You got it. So, listen,
we'll be chilling by noon.

569
00:30:46,815 --> 00:30:49,613
- Noon it is, bromosexual.
- <i>Nice.</i>

570
00:30:49,785 --> 00:30:52,481
We should hit up the casino again.
It's been a while.

571
00:30:52,654 --> 00:30:55,316
<i>Okay, yeah.</i>
<i>We'll definitely hit the casino up.</i>

572
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,755
Definitely. All right, peace, brother.

573
00:31:02,464 --> 00:31:04,625
I should call Angie soon.

574
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,826
Make up some bullshit.

575
00:31:08,003 --> 00:31:09,095
I'm cold.

576
00:31:09,271 --> 00:31:12,331
You're cold?
Oh, I'm not cold at all. Here.

577
00:31:12,507 --> 00:31:13,531
I run hot.

578
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:15,006
- Really?
- Yeah.

579
00:31:15,177 --> 00:31:18,476
- You got more body mass.
- Thick blood. Yeah, no, take it.

580
00:31:18,647 --> 00:31:21,878
- Thank you.
- I don't appreciate that, but it's okay.

581
00:31:22,284 --> 00:31:24,275
I'm gonna call Angie.

582
00:31:30,893 --> 00:31:32,520
Space.

583
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,129
Dale, wait. Wait.

584
00:31:37,432 --> 00:31:39,900
The phones. The phones.

585
00:31:40,068 --> 00:31:42,332
- You said they were cops, right?
- They are, yeah.

586
00:31:42,504 --> 00:31:44,062
I was thinking, maybe they can...

587
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:46,969
...triangulate these things, man,
or, like, trace them.

588
00:31:47,142 --> 00:31:49,042
- Right?
- That's how they got Saddam.

589
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:51,076
- Right.
- Fuck. You're right, man.

590
00:31:51,246 --> 00:31:52,907
Maybe they can even trace them...

591
00:31:53,081 --> 00:31:55,515
...like, when we're not even
on them, you know?

592
00:31:55,684 --> 00:31:59,176
Maybe if we bury them, the reception
will cut off and they won't be able to.

593
00:31:59,354 --> 00:32:01,322
We can tie it to an animal,
be a diversion.

594
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,957
We'll never catch an animal.

595
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:05,593
The squirrel'd be up in a tree,
they'd think we were.

596
00:32:05,761 --> 00:32:07,353
No, no, no.

597
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:09,895
- We'll build a hot-air balloon and...
- No.

598
00:32:10,065 --> 00:32:11,464
- We'll smash them.
- Yeah, yeah.

599
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:13,032
I'm gonna smash it. On a rock.

600
00:32:13,201 --> 00:32:16,136
- Right here. Good thinking.
- Good idea. Yes, destroy it.

601
00:32:16,305 --> 00:32:18,500
- Get it.
- Die. Yes.

602
00:32:20,175 --> 00:32:23,338
- What the fuck was that?
- I was trying to hit that tree. I missed.

603
00:32:23,512 --> 00:32:25,707
- What tree?
- That one.

604
00:32:25,881 --> 00:32:28,406
Why didn't you smash it
on a rock like a normal person?

605
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:31,450
I don't know. How often does
somebody smash things? I'm rusty.

606
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,554
Did you at least see
where it landed?

607
00:32:33,722 --> 00:32:35,349
I don't know. Call it.

608
00:32:35,991 --> 00:32:39,222
Call it? With what?
My phone has been smashed.

609
00:32:40,896 --> 00:32:43,023
I bet they can't even triangulate
those things.

610
00:32:43,198 --> 00:32:46,656
Well, you convinced me they can.
You were very convincing back there.

611
00:32:46,835 --> 00:32:49,429
Hey. Fine. I'll go find it. Fuck.

612
00:32:49,604 --> 00:32:51,731
- Do you see it?
- See what?

613
00:32:51,907 --> 00:32:54,171
The phone, you idiot.

614
00:32:54,343 --> 00:32:57,107
Why are we here?
This place is so fucking scary.

615
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,577
At least I had an idea.
You didn't, so shut up.

616
00:32:59,748 --> 00:33:02,512
That's not true. I had two ideas.
Nowhere and Quiznos.

617
00:33:03,151 --> 00:33:04,675
- What?
- What was that?

618
00:33:04,853 --> 00:33:05,911
- What?
- What is that?

619
00:33:06,088 --> 00:33:08,989
- What?
- I hear something.

620
00:33:09,157 --> 00:33:10,181
What?

621
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:12,224
I don't know. Do you hear that?

622
00:33:12,394 --> 00:33:14,760
Dude, I literally hear nothing.

623
00:33:15,664 --> 00:33:16,688
Oh, fuck!

624
00:33:16,865 --> 00:33:20,232
Where are you going? What are
you running from? Return to me now!

625
00:33:22,771 --> 00:33:23,795
Help me!

626
00:33:24,806 --> 00:33:26,296
Tell him to get away from me!

627
00:33:26,475 --> 00:33:28,670
I'm scared of this darkness!
I surrender!

628
00:33:28,844 --> 00:33:30,675
- Go away! Go away!
- I'm unarmed!

629
00:33:32,514 --> 00:33:34,482
- This isn't funny anymore!
- Dale!

630
00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:36,412
- Fall back!
- Save me!

631
00:33:49,264 --> 00:33:50,595
Oh, shit.

632
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:53,625
Car.

633
00:34:02,044 --> 00:34:03,978
Open it! Open it!
Open the door! Open it!

634
00:34:04,146 --> 00:34:06,410
- Unlock it.
- I can't unlock it.

635
00:34:06,581 --> 00:34:08,879
What are you doing?
Watch the upholstery.

636
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:12,714
- Go! I saw something!
- No! What did you see? Shut up!

637
00:34:12,888 --> 00:34:16,380
Shut the fuck... Shut up, man!

638
00:34:16,558 --> 00:34:18,822
I heard something,
then I saw something.

639
00:34:18,994 --> 00:34:20,689
You didn't hear anything, man.

640
00:34:20,862 --> 00:34:22,727
Well, I saw something.

641
00:34:26,535 --> 00:34:29,902
<i>And you're telling me that guy</i>
<i>in the little short shorts...</i>

642
00:34:30,072 --> 00:34:31,437
- <i>... broke your nose?</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

643
00:34:31,606 --> 00:34:35,508
<i>The BeDazzler guy</i>
<i>broke your nose, tough man?</i>

644
00:34:50,192 --> 00:34:52,524
Wake up. Get up. Wake up.

645
00:34:53,261 --> 00:34:55,491
How did I get on you?

646
00:34:56,231 --> 00:34:57,926
I wonder.

647
00:35:01,503 --> 00:35:03,801
Watch finally broke.

648
00:35:03,972 --> 00:35:05,564
Crazy. What time is it?

649
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:10,708
That can't be right.

650
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,039
It couldn't be 3 in the morning,
could it?

651
00:35:14,216 --> 00:35:16,309
It's 3:00 right now?

652
00:35:16,485 --> 00:35:18,009
Holy shit, man!

653
00:35:18,186 --> 00:35:21,678
We were supposed to be at Red's
at noon, man. What if he's gone?

654
00:35:21,857 --> 00:35:23,324
No, it's daylight-savings, so...

655
00:35:23,492 --> 00:35:26,484
- So it's only 2:00.
- Oh, no, it went forward an hour.

656
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:30,961
It's 4 o'-fucking-clock?
Fuck me. No, man. That's bad.

657
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,291
Shit. We slept for, like, 18 hours.

658
00:35:34,469 --> 00:35:36,994
My <i>bubbe...</i>
Man, my <i>bubbe's</i> gonna be so pissed.

659
00:35:37,172 --> 00:35:38,230
Shit.

660
00:35:38,406 --> 00:35:40,237
We gotta call Red.

661
00:35:40,408 --> 00:35:43,002
Okay. How?

662
00:35:43,178 --> 00:35:45,203
We'll go to a pay phone.

663
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:48,645
No, I can't.
His number is in my phone.

664
00:35:48,817 --> 00:35:50,808
Great. Well, do you remember
where he lives?

665
00:35:50,986 --> 00:35:52,283
Yeah, I know where he lives.

666
00:35:52,454 --> 00:35:54,581
What are you insinuating?
Like, I'm forgetful?

667
00:35:54,756 --> 00:35:56,189
"Insinuating." Good word.

668
00:35:56,358 --> 00:35:57,655
Do you know what that means?

669
00:35:57,826 --> 00:36:00,818
- I do, believe it or not.
- It means, like, "to seem like."

670
00:36:03,632 --> 00:36:05,759
Let's roll. I'm done with the woods.
Let's go.

671
00:36:05,934 --> 00:36:07,925
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here.

672
00:36:08,103 --> 00:36:12,005
Okay. Let's go. No. It's not working.
The battery's dead.

673
00:36:12,174 --> 00:36:13,801
Wait.

674
00:36:14,776 --> 00:36:16,107
What do you mean, it's dead?

675
00:36:16,278 --> 00:36:19,805
What do I mean? I mean
the battery's dead. The battery's dead.

676
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:21,642
What do you mean,
the battery's dead?

677
00:36:21,816 --> 00:36:24,307
How can I explain this
to you differently?

678
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:27,478
The battery is dead.
It ceased to live.

679
00:36:27,656 --> 00:36:31,183
It's deceased now. The car
needs a battery to start, Saul.

680
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,087
How did this happen?

681
00:36:34,262 --> 00:36:37,026
Well, we clearly fell asleep
with the battery on, and...

682
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:39,133
Oh, man. To talk radio?

683
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:41,701
- Yes, talk radio.
- It's so boring, man.

684
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,634
- Okay, okay.
- The car just committed suicide.

685
00:36:44,806 --> 00:36:46,933
Shut up, man. I have an idea now.

686
00:36:47,108 --> 00:36:48,370
We're gonna go.

687
00:36:48,543 --> 00:36:51,239
We'll walk back to the road.
We'll hitchhike.

688
00:36:51,413 --> 00:36:53,347
Someone will pick us up,
take us to Red's.

689
00:36:53,515 --> 00:36:56,746
Red will tell us everything's fine,
everything will go back to normal.

690
00:36:56,918 --> 00:36:58,180
How does that sound? Good?

691
00:36:58,353 --> 00:37:00,184
- That's a good idea.
- Keep our heads on.

692
00:37:00,355 --> 00:37:02,949
If we just keep thinking like this,
we're fucking gravy.

693
00:37:03,124 --> 00:37:05,149
- All right. I'm in.
- Let's do it.

694
00:37:13,602 --> 00:37:16,002
- Can I have my jacket back, please?
- Yeah.

695
00:37:16,171 --> 00:37:18,571
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

696
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,640
Thanks for taking care of it.

697
00:38:01,383 --> 00:38:03,681
Look, it's like my thumb is my cock.

698
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:09,355
That's not gonna get us a ride, man.

699
00:38:16,564 --> 00:38:18,361
Here's good.

700
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:25,970
Thanks for the smooth sailing,
Sharid.

701
00:38:26,141 --> 00:38:27,699
You're welcome.

702
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:35,213
- You're sure we can trust this guy?
- Yo, Red.

703
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:37,009
Who is it?

704
00:38:37,185 --> 00:38:40,848
- It's Bruce.
- Bruce? Who the fuck is this?

705
00:38:41,022 --> 00:38:44,185
- Saul. What's up?
- Who do you think it is?

706
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:45,383
Who's this?

707
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,528
I'm Dale, Mr. Red. Nice to meet you.

708
00:38:47,696 --> 00:38:48,720
Dale who?

709
00:38:48,897 --> 00:38:50,865
It's best if you don't know
my full name.

710
00:38:51,032 --> 00:38:52,294
Dale Denton. He's with me.

711
00:38:52,467 --> 00:38:54,799
Dale Denton. Nice to meet you, bro.

712
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:57,699
- Hold on. Let me get this lock, okay?
- You better.

713
00:38:57,872 --> 00:39:00,170
- Get in here.
- Coming in.

714
00:39:00,342 --> 00:39:03,038
- Y'all wanna buy some drugs?
- Frisk me.

715
00:39:03,211 --> 00:39:05,270
- What's up? What's up?
- Get it.

716
00:39:05,447 --> 00:39:07,381
Look at that, huh?

717
00:39:08,249 --> 00:39:10,774
- What's up, players?
- What's up?

718
00:39:10,952 --> 00:39:15,582
I've been up in here trying to get
a motherfucking scholarship. Chilling.

719
00:39:15,757 --> 00:39:17,190
What's up with the clothes?

720
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:20,224
We were camping.

721
00:39:20,395 --> 00:39:21,828
- Camping?
- Yeah.

722
00:39:21,996 --> 00:39:25,090
Is your lip okay, man?

723
00:39:25,266 --> 00:39:27,291
- You been crying?
- Oh, my lip.

724
00:39:28,303 --> 00:39:29,429
It's a cold sore.

725
00:39:29,604 --> 00:39:33,040
Never had one before,
so I started to cry.

726
00:39:34,175 --> 00:39:36,405
I think it's a lot worse
than it looks, though.

727
00:39:36,578 --> 00:39:39,138
Cold sore?
Does that mean fucking herpes?

728
00:39:39,647 --> 00:39:41,808
Yeah. Yes, it does.

729
00:39:41,983 --> 00:39:44,816
Fucking sick, man. You know
how many joints we've shared?

730
00:39:44,986 --> 00:39:47,716
I know. I'm a disgusting person.

731
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:49,379
Herpes is for life, bro.

732
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:53,015
I'm gonna try to definitely put
some sort of medical ointment on it.

733
00:39:53,194 --> 00:39:55,822
Been taking Vicodin.
Doesn't really take swelling down.

734
00:39:55,997 --> 00:39:57,726
It's from that time. I told you, man.

735
00:39:57,899 --> 00:40:01,266
You ate that lollipop out of that
stripper's snatch. You wanted to do it.

736
00:40:01,436 --> 00:40:04,098
Out of her vagina. Remember
what you did? What did you do?

737
00:40:04,272 --> 00:40:07,537
You ate a box of Nerds
out of her butthole.

738
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:11,167
You fucking said you wouldn't tell.
You sowed your own poison, man.

739
00:40:11,346 --> 00:40:14,008
Dudes, seriously, we're here
for a reason. Just ask him.

740
00:40:14,182 --> 00:40:18,414
Chill. I'm boiling some eggs over here.
We got a lot of time to hang out.

741
00:40:18,586 --> 00:40:20,315
- I'm making a fucking cake.
- No shit.

742
00:40:20,488 --> 00:40:21,750
Can I have a piece of that?

743
00:40:21,923 --> 00:40:24,187
- Don't ask for a piece.
- I can't have a piece?

744
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:25,849
No, you can't. This is private.

745
00:40:26,027 --> 00:40:27,790
Do you know what today is?

746
00:40:27,962 --> 00:40:30,897
- Tuesday.
- This is my cat's birthday today.

747
00:40:31,065 --> 00:40:34,228
I don't see a cat in here. I'm sorry.
You let it out by accident?

748
00:40:34,402 --> 00:40:36,370
No, because he died
three months ago, okay?

749
00:40:36,538 --> 00:40:37,869
So now who's the funny guy?

750
00:40:38,173 --> 00:40:39,197
Sorry.

751
00:40:39,374 --> 00:40:40,466
Today is his birthday...

752
00:40:40,642 --> 00:40:43,975
...and it is a tradition
that on his birthday...

753
00:40:44,145 --> 00:40:47,410
...I get up extra early and make him
his favorite kind of dessert.

754
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:49,908
Don't worry, bro.
Your cat's going to heaven.

755
00:40:50,084 --> 00:40:51,779
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe he went to heaven.

756
00:40:51,953 --> 00:40:54,046
He was a little fucker.
Could've gone to hell.

757
00:40:54,222 --> 00:40:55,416
What are we talk...? Guys...

758
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,114
Ask him. Just ask him, okay?

759
00:40:57,292 --> 00:40:59,385
Ask what? Just come straight.
What's up?

760
00:40:59,561 --> 00:41:01,552
- Yeah, right.
- Lay it on him.

761
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:03,697
We need to know...

762
00:41:03,865 --> 00:41:05,594
We need to know
about your source.

763
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:07,098
- Ted.
- Ted Jones.

764
00:41:07,268 --> 00:41:10,931
See, Dale, here,
is a protest servant.

765
00:41:11,105 --> 00:41:12,572
I'm not. That's not what I am.

766
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,868
He's not that,
but he was outside Ted's house...

767
00:41:16,044 --> 00:41:21,038
Don't... Look, we don't want
to bring you in to what we're in, okay?

768
00:41:21,216 --> 00:41:23,980
You don't want any trouble.
We don't wanna give you trouble.

769
00:41:24,152 --> 00:41:26,552
It's probably best
you don't know the whole story.

770
00:41:26,721 --> 00:41:29,588
- Don't think I can handle danger?
- What are you talking about?

771
00:41:29,757 --> 00:41:31,657
- You can.
- I totally can.

772
00:41:31,826 --> 00:41:33,589
And for you
to come into my house...

773
00:41:33,761 --> 00:41:36,992
...and not tell secrets
because you think you're saving me...

774
00:41:37,165 --> 00:41:39,861
...well, in reality, it just makes
you look like a dumb-ass.

775
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:41,262
Look at this. See this?

776
00:41:42,003 --> 00:41:44,233
You see that?
There's no hair under here, okay?

777
00:41:44,405 --> 00:41:45,872
What's the significance of that?

778
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,838
It makes me aerodynamic
when I fight. I can take danger.

779
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,707
Okay, has anyone called asking
about Saul or the Pineapple Express?

780
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:55,349
That's all we need to know.

781
00:41:58,453 --> 00:41:59,977
Is it "uh-huh" or "uh-uh"?

782
00:42:00,154 --> 00:42:02,145
- It's "uh-uh."
- There it is, man.

783
00:42:02,323 --> 00:42:05,258
Cleared. Over.

784
00:42:05,426 --> 00:42:07,394
Everything's fine. I told you, bro.

785
00:42:07,562 --> 00:42:09,223
We had a wacky night
in the woods...

786
00:42:09,397 --> 00:42:12,025
...but we both can put that
behind us like adults.

787
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,293
Now it's time
to get super-duper high.

788
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:15,936
Got that bong I got in Tel Aviv?

789
00:42:16,104 --> 00:42:17,435
"Bong Mitzvah." Hit it up.

790
00:42:17,605 --> 00:42:19,299
Yes.

791
00:42:19,741 --> 00:42:21,003
There you go.

792
00:42:21,175 --> 00:42:23,200
Why don't you follow his lead
and chill out?

793
00:42:23,378 --> 00:42:25,471
I'm chill.
I'm chill as a cucumber, man.

794
00:42:25,647 --> 00:42:28,207
- You don't seem chill.
- More chill than you.

795
00:42:28,383 --> 00:42:29,611
You're more chill than me?

796
00:42:29,784 --> 00:42:32,309
Look at what I'm wearing. Kimono.
What are you wearing?

797
00:42:32,487 --> 00:42:34,387
- Suit.
- Yeah. Exactly.

798
00:42:34,556 --> 00:42:37,753
I don't know what's up with you,
but I don't know if I like you.

799
00:42:37,926 --> 00:42:40,053
Well, I don't know
if I like you either, man.

800
00:42:40,228 --> 00:42:42,560
Well, that's your loss,
because I'm a great friend.

801
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:45,460
I'm gonna use the <i>telefono</i>
to call my wife, okay?

802
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:46,793
- Give her a call.
- I will.

803
00:42:46,968 --> 00:42:49,300
- Go ahead.
- Don't pay attention to what I'm saying.

804
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,994
Oh, I won't.

805
00:42:52,307 --> 00:42:53,365
Bullshit.

806
00:42:54,108 --> 00:42:55,905
No, no, no.

807
00:42:56,077 --> 00:42:57,544
- Liar.
- What are you doing, man?

808
00:42:57,712 --> 00:43:00,180
He's a liar. He's lying to us, man.
He's lying to us.

809
00:43:00,348 --> 00:43:01,337
No, he's not.

810
00:43:01,516 --> 00:43:03,416
He knows my name.
He's acting weird.

811
00:43:03,585 --> 00:43:05,519
We can't let him
phone anyone, man.

812
00:43:05,687 --> 00:43:08,155
Freaking out. You're paranoid.
Give him the phone.

813
00:43:08,323 --> 00:43:09,551
I do not trust you, sir.

814
00:43:09,724 --> 00:43:11,487
- You're paranoid.
- He's acting weird.

815
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:13,650
Red, I'm sorry, bro.

816
00:43:13,828 --> 00:43:15,386
- Jesus!
- Holy cock.

817
00:43:15,563 --> 00:43:16,723
Fuck you!

818
00:43:16,898 --> 00:43:18,593
What are you doing, man?
He's sorry.

819
00:43:18,766 --> 00:43:20,028
Oh, Jesus.

820
00:43:22,403 --> 00:43:24,132
Herpes!

821
00:43:24,472 --> 00:43:26,440
I don't wanna have to do this.

822
00:43:26,608 --> 00:43:27,768
Red, you're crazy, man.

823
00:43:27,942 --> 00:43:29,910
You brought the devil
into my house.

824
00:43:30,078 --> 00:43:31,807
- We're friends.
- I know we are.

825
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,039
- That's why it sucks.
- Are you on meth again?

826
00:43:35,717 --> 00:43:38,208
Dale, he's hurting me!

827
00:43:38,386 --> 00:43:39,910
Toilet.

828
00:43:40,088 --> 00:43:41,578
Flush.

829
00:43:41,756 --> 00:43:44,987
What we do in this life
echoes in eternity.

830
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:47,491
True!

831
00:43:59,874 --> 00:44:03,605
He's going for the phone
to call Ted!

832
00:44:04,245 --> 00:44:06,145
Stay out of here!

833
00:44:08,983 --> 00:44:11,383
Red, don't do it!

834
00:44:13,421 --> 00:44:15,150
- Red!
- You assholes.

835
00:44:15,323 --> 00:44:16,881
You ruined my portable phone.

836
00:44:17,058 --> 00:44:19,253
- Teamwork.
- Yes.

837
00:44:20,561 --> 00:44:22,654
You're gonna break the door.
Gonna pay for it?

838
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:27,959
Fuck.

839
00:44:28,136 --> 00:44:29,535
Phone.

840
00:44:31,873 --> 00:44:34,068
- Let go! Let go! Let go!
- What the hell...?

841
00:44:34,242 --> 00:44:36,767
I let go, now just get this
goddamn door off of me!

842
00:44:36,944 --> 00:44:38,434
Tell us everything, now!

843
00:44:38,613 --> 00:44:39,944
Said they were gonna kill me.

844
00:44:40,114 --> 00:44:42,105
What did you tell Ted?

845
00:44:42,283 --> 00:44:44,217
He's crushing my balls.
Crushing my balls.

846
00:44:44,385 --> 00:44:45,852
Smash them.

847
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,044
Fuck!

848
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:48,620
Time out. Time out.

849
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:49,984
Time out. Time out.

850
00:44:50,158 --> 00:44:51,921
- Truce.
- Time in. Fuck you.

851
00:44:52,093 --> 00:44:53,890
- Stop!
- Cheater!

852
00:44:54,062 --> 00:44:55,825
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Red!

853
00:44:55,997 --> 00:44:58,431
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get...

854
00:44:59,667 --> 00:45:00,691
Fuck.

855
00:45:02,203 --> 00:45:03,670
God...

856
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:05,135
Fuck!

857
00:45:05,306 --> 00:45:07,297
- Take it, motherfucker!
- Time out!

858
00:45:09,644 --> 00:45:11,236
Fuck!

859
00:45:14,682 --> 00:45:16,081
No! No, no, no!

860
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,115
Where you going, huh?

861
00:45:18,286 --> 00:45:20,345
Where do you think you're going,
Mr. Wiggles?

862
00:45:20,521 --> 00:45:23,285
- Come on. Get back here.
- Saul, help me! Help me!

863
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:24,857
He's punching my bum!

864
00:45:25,026 --> 00:45:27,790
I'm done with this.
Let's talk. Let's try words.

865
00:45:27,962 --> 00:45:31,625
Use words! No! No! No!

866
00:45:34,836 --> 00:45:36,201
You okay, man?

867
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:38,861
- I'll get you another bong.
- It's my cat's birthday.

868
00:45:40,241 --> 00:45:41,936
Happy birthday.

869
00:45:42,443 --> 00:45:43,467
- All right?
- Thank you.

870
00:45:43,644 --> 00:45:45,942
I think there's a package
in the mailbox.

871
00:45:46,114 --> 00:45:48,173
This ends now!

872
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,687
Oh, shit.

873
00:45:53,855 --> 00:45:55,652
Was that too much?

874
00:45:57,525 --> 00:45:59,493
Can't get the edge.

875
00:46:00,027 --> 00:46:01,927
Wait. Got it. Got it.

876
00:46:02,096 --> 00:46:03,222
Hey, Dale.

877
00:46:03,397 --> 00:46:06,730
Think we're gonna have to kill him?
I don't think I'm capable of murder.

878
00:46:06,901 --> 00:46:08,129
I don't think I am either.

879
00:46:08,302 --> 00:46:11,066
Maybe we could just convince him
to kill himself.

880
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:13,673
Or, just not say anything.

881
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:18,040
We need to find out
everything he knows, okay?

882
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,472
Wake up.

883
00:46:21,015 --> 00:46:22,141
Hey, what's up, dudes?

884
00:46:22,316 --> 00:46:25,376
What's up? Tell us everything now.

885
00:46:25,553 --> 00:46:26,577
Talk, Red.

886
00:46:26,754 --> 00:46:29,120
I'm gonna flex and bust out of here.

887
00:46:33,327 --> 00:46:34,521
Trapped.

888
00:46:34,695 --> 00:46:35,957
Not happening, Red.

889
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,621
Okay. All right. Okay, I'll talk.

890
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,294
Ted Jones, he knows you witnessed
the murder. He found your roach.

891
00:46:43,471 --> 00:46:46,440
He sent two guys over here,
Budlofsky and Matheson.

892
00:46:46,607 --> 00:46:48,939
Two real big son of a bitches.

893
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,873
They're basically
out to kill you guys.

894
00:46:51,045 --> 00:46:53,673
They're gonna kill me too,
unless I turn y'all over.

895
00:46:53,848 --> 00:46:55,679
So you guys are basically fucked.

896
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:58,444
How many cops does he have
on his payroll? Tell us.

897
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:01,417
- Well, there's the woman cop, Carol.
- That's the lady cop.

898
00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:04,854
I don't know. He could have a bunch.
This dude is super well-connected.

899
00:47:05,026 --> 00:47:07,995
And he has a really awesome
hideout too. It's pretty badass.

900
00:47:08,162 --> 00:47:09,720
- Oh, shit.
- What else?

901
00:47:09,897 --> 00:47:12,092
He's at a war right now
with the Asians.

902
00:47:12,266 --> 00:47:13,733
They're in a drug war right now.

903
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:16,233
Asians? What Asians?
Indians are technically Asian.

904
00:47:16,404 --> 00:47:17,996
- It's true.
- What Asians?

905
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:21,972
I don't know. What? Chinese?
Or Korean or...

906
00:47:22,143 --> 00:47:23,167
Vietcong?

907
00:47:23,344 --> 00:47:26,006
Yeah, little... Just little Asian people.

908
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:31,777
Like, the Asians with the guns
and the drugs, and not his friends.

909
00:47:31,953 --> 00:47:32,977
- Ding-dong.
- Hey, Red!

910
00:47:33,154 --> 00:47:34,485
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, they're here.

911
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,020
They're here to kill me.

912
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:40,058
Okay, I know I sold y'all out. I've been
a son of a bitch and a shitty friend.

913
00:47:40,228 --> 00:47:42,628
Saul, I'm talking to you.
Dale, you're a new friend.

914
00:47:42,797 --> 00:47:44,992
I can make it up.
I forgot, "bro's before ho's."

915
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:47,634
Just go out the back porch.
I won't say anything.

916
00:47:47,802 --> 00:47:49,167
- I'll cover for you.
- Thanks.

917
00:47:49,337 --> 00:47:51,100
No sweat.

918
00:47:55,576 --> 00:47:57,476
It was Dale Denton.
Dale Denton and Saul.

919
00:47:57,645 --> 00:48:00,808
They're on the back porch.
You can catch them if you hurry. Go.

920
00:48:03,484 --> 00:48:05,076
Hey. In here.

921
00:48:05,253 --> 00:48:07,244
I've gotta get to a phone. Come on.

922
00:48:07,421 --> 00:48:09,013
- We should hide.
- Why?

923
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:11,124
If Red tells Ted's guys
about my name...

924
00:48:11,292 --> 00:48:13,055
...then they'll go to my apartment.

925
00:48:13,227 --> 00:48:16,924
There, I have Angie's name. They'll
put that together, find her. Let's go.

926
00:48:17,098 --> 00:48:18,588
No. I think we should stay.

927
00:48:18,766 --> 00:48:21,098
- Why?
- I'm in the dumpster already.

928
00:48:21,269 --> 00:48:24,329
Well, then, get out.
Come on, you're already dirty.

929
00:48:26,307 --> 00:48:28,798
- They're gone.
- <i>Well, find out what he knows.</i>

930
00:48:28,976 --> 00:48:30,466
Red, it's your last chance, man.

931
00:48:30,645 --> 00:48:32,442
You gonna give us something
we can use?

932
00:48:32,613 --> 00:48:36,014
Matheson, you gotta be kidding me.
I mean, what more do you want?

933
00:48:36,183 --> 00:48:38,276
I told you that the guy's name
is Dale Denton.

934
00:48:38,452 --> 00:48:40,079
He's obviously working with Saul.

935
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:42,222
They came in here,
busted my house to shit.

936
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:44,051
They kicked the hell out of me...

937
00:48:44,225 --> 00:48:46,420
...duct-taped me
to my grandfather's wheelchair.

938
00:48:46,594 --> 00:48:49,062
What more do you want?
Want me to read your horoscope?

939
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:52,927
- You hear that, Ted?
- Ask if either of them were Asian.

940
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,591
- What skin color were they?
- They were white people.

941
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:57,829
Denton might've been a Jew.
I don't know.

942
00:48:58,005 --> 00:49:00,166
I don't judge people
based on things like that.

943
00:49:00,341 --> 00:49:02,707
Obviously. We're friends.

944
00:49:02,877 --> 00:49:04,174
<i>Ted, you hear him?</i>

945
00:49:04,345 --> 00:49:08,247
Dale Denton: not Asian.
All right. Kill Red.

946
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:11,943
Listen, I would appreciate it
if both y'all would take your shoes off.

947
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:14,610
This is brand-new carpet.
You're tracking mud in here.

948
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:16,450
Matheson, you got
British Knights on.

949
00:49:16,624 --> 00:49:18,615
I ain't seen anybody wear them
since 1987.

950
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:22,057
What the hell are you doing?

951
00:49:22,229 --> 00:49:23,958
Ted told me to kill him.

952
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:26,929
Well, how about
a little fucking discretion here?

953
00:49:27,101 --> 00:49:29,001
See? See? See, right there.
You see that?

954
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,296
- You catch it?
- See what?

955
00:49:30,471 --> 00:49:33,531
You used to not give
a fuck about discretion.

956
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:36,734
I seen you pull somebody's
jawbone off. I seen it.

957
00:49:37,578 --> 00:49:39,011
You was ruthless.

958
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,546
You was ruthless, man.

959
00:49:41,716 --> 00:49:44,776
What the fuck, man?
You shot me in my stomach.

960
00:49:45,486 --> 00:49:47,181
I'm gonna die now probably.

961
00:49:47,355 --> 00:49:50,756
I had you all over here for dinner.
Fish tacos.

962
00:49:50,925 --> 00:49:52,449
This how you do me?

963
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:57,861
So, what did Budlofsky
and Matheson say?

964
00:49:58,032 --> 00:49:59,659
I don't know.

965
00:50:00,735 --> 00:50:03,067
There's this guy, Saul...

966
00:50:03,637 --> 00:50:06,572
...something, selling weed who works
with some guy, Dale Denton.

967
00:50:06,741 --> 00:50:08,106
That's all he got out of him.

968
00:50:08,275 --> 00:50:11,711
Do you think he has anything to do
with the guy that we shot?

969
00:50:11,879 --> 00:50:13,744
Well, did he say anything else?

970
00:50:13,914 --> 00:50:17,179
Saul mentioned something about
"going to the casino."

971
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:19,478
- Weird.
- "Going to the casino"?

972
00:50:19,653 --> 00:50:21,746
The Asians own the casino, Ted.

973
00:50:21,922 --> 00:50:25,358
- I need another beer.
- He's gotta be working for them.

974
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:29,261
Maybe after we popped that guy,
they hired this outside guy, Dale...

975
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,591
What's his name? Denton?
- to finish the job.

976
00:50:32,066 --> 00:50:33,090
<i>Maybe.</i>

977
00:50:33,267 --> 00:50:36,395
<i>Maybe. Well, I'll be back in an hour.</i>

978
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:40,062
<i>I'll have everything there is to know</i>
<i>about this Dale Denton guy.</i>

979
00:50:40,241 --> 00:50:43,642
<i>Who he's screwing,</i>
<i>who's his mother, everything.</i>

980
00:50:43,878 --> 00:50:45,436
I have to take a shit.

981
00:50:47,615 --> 00:50:49,446
Wait. Where are we going?

982
00:50:49,617 --> 00:50:53,917
I gotta... I gotta get to Angie's.
I have to make sure she's okay.

983
00:50:54,088 --> 00:50:56,556
What about my <i>bubbe?</i>
Don't think they'll go after her.

984
00:50:56,724 --> 00:50:59,284
I mean, she has
a different last name.

985
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,791
Belogus.

986
00:51:00,961 --> 00:51:04,294
I don't know. We should get out of
the middle of the road. Come on.

987
00:51:20,448 --> 00:51:22,279
You guys can wait
as long as you want...

988
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:26,181
...but one minute from right now,
I'm gonna eat some food.

989
00:51:26,353 --> 00:51:29,254
And you can call it rude.
You can call it whatever you want.

990
00:51:29,423 --> 00:51:32,824
You can be polite with your clean
plates, but I'm gonna be eating food.

991
00:51:32,993 --> 00:51:34,017
Dad, he'll be here.

992
00:51:34,195 --> 00:51:37,255
I'm going in the other room and eat it,
check my e-mail. I'm done.

993
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:40,423
Honey, we're at the table.
No one's going to leave the table.

994
00:51:43,471 --> 00:51:45,962
- Okay. This is it.
- All right. Let's do this.

995
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,732
No, no, no. I'm going alone.

996
00:51:47,908 --> 00:51:49,967
- No.
- Yeah. Yeah.

997
00:51:50,144 --> 00:51:53,011
- I wanna meet Angie.
- You'll meet her later, man. Look.

998
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,740
Look, I need you to stay out here.
Keep guard, okay?

999
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:57,679
- It's important. Watch my back.
- Okay.

1000
00:51:57,852 --> 00:51:59,979
- Thanks.
- All right. Just be yourself.

1001
00:52:00,154 --> 00:52:01,849
I'll keep guard.

1002
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:03,948
Hey.

1003
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:06,917
Shit.

1004
00:52:07,094 --> 00:52:08,652
Oh, no.

1005
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:09,853
Hey, Dale.

1006
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:12,965
- Hello, Dale.
- Hey.

1007
00:52:13,134 --> 00:52:14,158
Dinner.

1008
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:19,235
This is the dinner you invited me to.
That was tonight. That's why I'm here.

1009
00:52:19,406 --> 00:52:20,703
Sit. Please.

1010
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:23,173
Of course. Hi.

1011
00:52:23,344 --> 00:52:24,936
- Hi.
- Shannon.

1012
00:52:25,112 --> 00:52:26,739
- Intros.
- Great to meet you.

1013
00:52:26,914 --> 00:52:29,644
- Robert, if I'm not mistaken.
- Sit down, so we can eat.

1014
00:52:29,817 --> 00:52:32,251
- Hi, Dale.
- Hey. Okay.

1015
00:52:32,419 --> 00:52:33,909
- What happened to you?
- Nothing.

1016
00:52:34,088 --> 00:52:35,953
I'm supposed to be here right now.

1017
00:52:36,123 --> 00:52:37,249
So I'm here.

1018
00:52:37,424 --> 00:52:40,587
- You're all dirty and bleeding.
- No, I'm not. I'm here for dinner.

1019
00:52:40,761 --> 00:52:44,595
- You have scratches on your forehead.
- Dude, you smell like shit.

1020
00:52:44,765 --> 00:52:47,427
- Dale, what happened to you?
- I was in the woods.

1021
00:52:47,601 --> 00:52:50,764
- In the woods?
- Yeah. Isn't that weird? I was...

1022
00:52:50,938 --> 00:52:52,838
- I was in the woods.
- What were you doing?

1023
00:52:53,007 --> 00:52:55,339
I bird-watch. I don't.

1024
00:52:55,509 --> 00:52:58,410
No, I don't.
Look, I'm gonna come clean.

1025
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:02,242
I witnessed a murder, okay?

1026
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:04,316
I saw someone
murder someone else...

1027
00:53:04,485 --> 00:53:07,010
...and I think
they've been following me.

1028
00:53:07,188 --> 00:53:09,452
There's a good chance
they went to my apartment...

1029
00:53:09,623 --> 00:53:11,318
...where Angie has a lot of things.

1030
00:53:11,492 --> 00:53:14,461
Her yearbooks, report cards,
her cell number is written...

1031
00:53:14,628 --> 00:53:15,925
...and it's on my fridge.

1032
00:53:16,096 --> 00:53:18,724
So they could then find this house.
They could come here.

1033
00:53:18,899 --> 00:53:20,594
We should call the police
right away.

1034
00:53:20,768 --> 00:53:22,861
We can't. The police
were the murderers.

1035
00:53:23,037 --> 00:53:25,562
We can't call the police.
They were the murderers.

1036
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:28,401
Angie, I swear to God,
you do something or I'm gonna...

1037
00:53:28,576 --> 00:53:30,635
- So fucked up.
- No. Don't let him "gonna."

1038
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:34,338
No, don't wanna. Look,
we gotta get the F out of here.

1039
00:53:34,515 --> 00:53:37,143
Let's go. We need to begin
to prematurely evacuate.

1040
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:39,809
- Are you high?
- What? No. I'm not high. Why...?

1041
00:53:39,987 --> 00:53:41,818
You are high as a fucking kite.

1042
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:43,456
I'm not high. Let's go.

1043
00:53:43,624 --> 00:53:45,717
We're not going.
I'm coming back in a minute.

1044
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:48,123
You know what I'm coming back with?
With a gun.

1045
00:53:48,295 --> 00:53:50,525
You better be out.
I'm not fucking with you.

1046
00:53:50,698 --> 00:53:52,689
Your gun? His gun?

1047
00:53:52,866 --> 00:53:55,334
Why do you...? Don't get a gun.
Why would he bear arms?

1048
00:53:55,502 --> 00:53:59,495
No, we need to go.
Everyone, I'm leading the parade.

1049
00:54:15,522 --> 00:54:17,285
- This is so exciting.
- <i>Okay, okay.</i>

1050
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:19,585
Is this where you're parked?
Let's sally forth.

1051
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,159
Who is after you, after Angie?

1052
00:54:21,328 --> 00:54:24,729
They're drug dealers. I have reason
to believe that they're drug dealers.

1053
00:54:24,898 --> 00:54:27,366
What are you talking about?
You're out of your mind.

1054
00:54:27,534 --> 00:54:29,968
- I know it sounds crazy.
- Hide.

1055
00:54:30,137 --> 00:54:33,538
Dale! Dale! Dale! It's happening.
I was eating a Fruit Roll...

1056
00:54:33,741 --> 00:54:35,003
- Why'd you do that?
- God!

1057
00:54:35,175 --> 00:54:36,904
- Get it!
- Jesus! Okay! Just stop!

1058
00:54:37,077 --> 00:54:40,342
- Angie, what did you do?
- He's one of the drug dealers!

1059
00:54:40,514 --> 00:54:42,641
- He's my pot dealer.
- He's your pot dealer?

1060
00:54:42,816 --> 00:54:43,942
- I got it.
- Get it.

1061
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:48,853
- Gross. Are you okay?
- Dale, who is this?

1062
00:54:49,023 --> 00:54:52,015
- He's my... Oh, shit. Get down.
- Dad!

1063
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:57,992
What was that?

1064
00:54:58,165 --> 00:55:00,224
That was a gunshot.

1065
00:55:04,238 --> 00:55:06,138
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

1066
00:55:06,307 --> 00:55:08,241
- He's with me.
- I'm the good drug dealer.

1067
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:10,809
- Put the gun down!
- Put down the gun.

1068
00:55:10,978 --> 00:55:12,707
You assholes
do exactly what I say...

1069
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,713
...or I will take you outside
and fuck you in the street.

1070
00:55:15,883 --> 00:55:17,612
- No, don't.
- Don't fuck us anywhere.

1071
00:55:29,096 --> 00:55:31,064
Anybody out there?

1072
00:55:34,068 --> 00:55:36,502
Fucking hide-and-seek.

1073
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,297
Say, now.

1074
00:55:40,808 --> 00:55:43,174
Hey, the food's still warm.

1075
00:55:46,246 --> 00:55:47,440
Love it.

1076
00:55:47,614 --> 00:55:49,605
Come on, Saul. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1077
00:55:49,783 --> 00:55:52,251
Yes. We made it.
We're all safe, guys. We made it.

1078
00:55:52,419 --> 00:55:53,750
- What are you doing?
- Get out.

1079
00:55:53,921 --> 00:55:56,651
Get out of my car.
I can't believe you think it's an option.

1080
00:55:56,824 --> 00:55:58,951
Okay. Okay. That makes sense.
It makes sense.

1081
00:55:59,126 --> 00:56:01,219
Come on, let's go.
It makes sense. He's right.

1082
00:56:01,395 --> 00:56:04,831
- Stay away from my family. Period.
- So where do we go? What do we do?

1083
00:56:04,998 --> 00:56:07,330
Go to the Days Inn
downtown, okay?

1084
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:09,628
Use a fake name.

1085
00:56:10,137 --> 00:56:12,128
Garagely. I'll contact you.

1086
00:56:12,306 --> 00:56:15,275
I don't know who these people are,
what they're capable of...

1087
00:56:15,442 --> 00:56:18,138
...but I will keep you guys safe,
I promise that.

1088
00:56:18,312 --> 00:56:19,609
Fuck off, loser.

1089
00:56:21,582 --> 00:56:25,177
Angie, you're a fucking idiot.
I say that with love.

1090
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:27,644
So get this:

1091
00:56:27,821 --> 00:56:29,413
We triangulated the cells.

1092
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:33,151
They smashed one, threw the other
in the woods to try to distract us.

1093
00:56:33,327 --> 00:56:35,352
It took an hour for Jared to find it.

1094
00:56:35,529 --> 00:56:38,225
And then he said
that he found Denton's car...

1095
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:40,765
...filled with all these
strange disguises.

1096
00:56:40,934 --> 00:56:44,199
A powdered wig,
a sombrero, leotards.

1097
00:56:44,371 --> 00:56:46,202
I mean, what the fuck
does that mean?

1098
00:56:46,373 --> 00:56:48,864
Why don't I just call the Asians
and talk to Cheung?

1099
00:56:49,042 --> 00:56:51,340
Why beat around the bush,
you know?

1100
00:57:03,023 --> 00:57:03,853
Hello?

1101
00:57:04,057 --> 00:57:05,081
<i>Cheung, it's Ted.</i>

1102
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:06,658
Record this conversation.

1103
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:11,027
Ted, what a surprise.
What can I do for you?

1104
00:57:11,198 --> 00:57:15,191
Well, Cheung, my friend,
let me tell you.

1105
00:57:15,369 --> 00:57:19,271
You know, we both know
that you sent one of your very skilled...

1106
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,433
<i>... hit men over here last night,</i>
<i>and I and my colleague...</i>

1107
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:26,773
...made a little decoration
on our window. Should have seen it.

1108
00:57:26,947 --> 00:57:30,314
<i>We painted the wall with his brain.</i>
<i>Painted it.</i>

1109
00:57:30,484 --> 00:57:34,147
And now this Dale Denton guy?
You serious?

1110
00:57:34,321 --> 00:57:37,916
Just stop it, okay? Stop it or you're
asking for war. Do you want a war?

1111
00:57:38,325 --> 00:57:39,349
Bring it on.

1112
00:57:39,526 --> 00:57:41,960
<i>You listen to me, you motherfucker!</i>

1113
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:44,597
It is on! We're coming at you
with everything we got!

1114
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:47,290
It's on, so you better get your head
out of your ass...

1115
00:57:47,468 --> 00:57:49,129
...and be ready for everything!

1116
00:57:49,303 --> 00:57:51,168
You are fucking dead!

1117
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:53,432
You are so dumb.

1118
00:57:53,607 --> 00:57:57,099
Do you have any idea
how weak you just made us look?

1119
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:01,639
Goddamn it!

1120
00:58:01,982 --> 00:58:03,313
Totally sweet.

1121
00:58:03,717 --> 00:58:06,015
Ted Jones is slipping.

1122
00:58:06,186 --> 00:58:09,815
We shall strike now with full force.

1123
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:13,721
Your brother's death
will not be in vain.

1124
00:58:16,263 --> 00:58:19,892
I gotta say, I've had, like,
a lot of weed dealers in my day.

1125
00:58:20,067 --> 00:58:22,661
You're the coolest I've ever had.
They were all dicks.

1126
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:25,327
- Really? Thanks, man.
- No problem.

1127
00:58:25,506 --> 00:58:27,940
I really appreciate it.
That means a lot to me.

1128
00:58:28,108 --> 00:58:31,908
It's, like, you're the first guy that I ever
sold to that I became friends with.

1129
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:35,981
They say, like, "Don't dip the pen
in company ink."

1130
00:58:36,149 --> 00:58:39,141
I'm totally glad
I dipped in your ink, bro.

1131
00:58:40,387 --> 00:58:41,877
Yeah.

1132
00:58:44,525 --> 00:58:47,153
We should get out of town.
That's probably our next move.

1133
00:58:47,327 --> 00:58:48,988
Just get on a bus and leave, right?

1134
00:58:49,897 --> 00:58:51,194
Get bus tickets.

1135
00:58:51,365 --> 00:58:54,801
Go to the next town.
Contact some police.

1136
00:58:54,968 --> 00:58:57,232
You know what I was saying?
Like, I'm totally...

1137
00:58:57,404 --> 00:58:59,338
You're glad you dipped your pen
in my ink.

1138
00:58:59,506 --> 00:59:01,701
But we should get bus tickets
and leave, right?

1139
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:03,069
What?

1140
00:59:03,243 --> 00:59:06,371
Get on the bus? Leave?
Buy bus tickets?

1141
00:59:06,547 --> 00:59:09,880
I only have, like, 50 bucks.
I don't think that'll even buy one ticket.

1142
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:11,747
What about your sack?

1143
00:59:11,919 --> 00:59:14,786
Oh, man, it's fucking killing me.
I feel like I popped one.

1144
00:59:15,989 --> 00:59:18,924
No. That's unfortunate,
but that's not what I'm talking about.

1145
00:59:19,092 --> 00:59:20,559
I mean, like, the sack of weed.

1146
00:59:20,727 --> 00:59:22,786
Couldn't we just,
like, sell some weed...

1147
00:59:22,963 --> 00:59:24,624
...get some cash
and buy bus tickets?

1148
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:28,825
- Of course, man. That's what I do.
- That's what you do. Fucking A.

1149
00:59:29,002 --> 00:59:31,795
Okay, so you're gonna buy tickets
for Saturday's game, right?

1150
00:59:31,972 --> 00:59:33,564
These guys are amazing.

1151
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:35,439
What the fuck do you want?

1152
00:59:35,609 --> 00:59:37,770
You guys wanna buy some chronic?

1153
00:59:44,585 --> 00:59:46,052
What's this stuff called again?

1154
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:48,244
Pineapple Express.
They said it eight times.

1155
00:59:48,422 --> 00:59:51,619
- Yeah, but don't call it that.
- Yeah, that's not what it's called.

1156
00:59:51,792 --> 00:59:54,659
- Call it Banana Boat.
- Make sure you leave it at weed too.

1157
00:59:54,828 --> 00:59:57,763
This can be a gateway drug.
Don't wanna move on to other things.

1158
00:59:57,931 --> 01:00:00,399
- Cocaine. Don't do that.
- We don't fuck around.

1159
01:00:00,567 --> 01:00:04,628
- Don't worry. Don't tell us what to do.
- Inhale it, Chachi. Inhale it.

1160
01:00:04,805 --> 01:00:06,204
Who the fuck's Chachi?

1161
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:26,183
- How much money you guys got?
- Come on.

1162
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,726
You each get as much
as you can grab with one hand.

1163
01:00:28,895 --> 01:00:31,193
Go easy. That's a big handful, guys.
Come on.

1164
01:00:31,365 --> 01:00:35,028
- Keep it on the down-low.
- Don't tell anybody where you got it.

1165
01:00:35,202 --> 01:00:39,366
You got it from Saul... I mean, you got
it from Santiago and Dunbar.

1166
01:00:39,539 --> 01:00:42,372
- Go. Come on.
- Go, go. Vamoose!

1167
01:00:44,444 --> 01:00:45,536
You fucking did it, man.

1168
01:00:45,712 --> 01:00:48,374
You are a good salesman.
You got it in you, man.

1169
01:00:48,548 --> 01:00:50,982
I'm about to go get some
celebratory Slushees.

1170
01:00:51,151 --> 01:00:52,641
Get some burritos or something.

1171
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:54,787
Something to drink too.
Something good.

1172
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:57,389
See you, man. Nice.

1173
01:01:03,597 --> 01:01:06,998
Don't move. Don't you move.
This shit hurts.

1174
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:08,759
Don't move. What's in your hand?

1175
01:01:08,935 --> 01:01:10,698
It's weed. It's a joint. It's a roach.

1176
01:01:10,871 --> 01:01:12,566
- Right here.
- I was just smoking...

1177
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:15,264
I thought it was decriminalized,
to be honest with you.

1178
01:01:15,442 --> 01:01:19,708
I have horrible anorexia,
and it helps my appetite. I'm so sorry.

1179
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:24,647
Look, selling narcotics to my students
is not decriminalized.

1180
01:01:24,818 --> 01:01:27,810
- Okay. I understand.
- I'm the liaison officer for this school.

1181
01:01:27,988 --> 01:01:31,082
And guess what? I just saw three
students walking from back here...

1182
01:01:31,258 --> 01:01:34,591
...with their eyes as red
as the devil's dick. You're busted.

1183
01:01:40,801 --> 01:01:42,666
- On the hood. On the hood.
- Okay, okay.

1184
01:01:42,836 --> 01:01:44,565
I'm on the hood. Come on.

1185
01:01:44,738 --> 01:01:47,502
- Stand still. Stand still.
- I'm still. I'm sorry.

1186
01:01:47,674 --> 01:01:51,405
You better hope it's clean.
Better hope ain't shit on this record.

1187
01:01:51,578 --> 01:01:54,411
I'm gonna put my foot
up in your ass.

1188
01:01:58,085 --> 01:02:00,553
Oh, big sexy with glasses.

1189
01:02:02,823 --> 01:02:06,315
This is Officer Barbara. Requesting
an update on fugitive Dale Denton.

1190
01:02:06,493 --> 01:02:11,021
I repeat, requesting update on Dale
Denton. I have the fugitive in custody.

1191
01:02:11,198 --> 01:02:13,223
425, 425, what's your location?

1192
01:02:14,768 --> 01:02:16,030
You going down.

1193
01:02:16,203 --> 01:02:18,296
What? What do you mean...?
Why am I going down?

1194
01:02:18,472 --> 01:02:20,736
What did that thing tell you?
What are you doing?

1195
01:02:20,907 --> 01:02:23,137
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

1196
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:25,801
I wasn't doing things.
Why do you hate me so much?

1197
01:02:25,979 --> 01:02:28,413
Hit-and-run, Mr. Denton.
Hit-and-run.

1198
01:02:28,582 --> 01:02:30,049
Two parked cars, two nights ago.

1199
01:02:30,217 --> 01:02:32,276
One of them was actually
a police cruiser.

1200
01:02:32,452 --> 01:02:35,319
You gotta be the dumbest
motherfucker in captivity.

1201
01:02:35,489 --> 01:02:38,356
It's the lady cop.
They got Dale. Oh, shit.

1202
01:02:38,525 --> 01:02:40,425
So you're telling me
you saw Ted Jones...

1203
01:02:40,594 --> 01:02:42,357
...and a police officer
shoot somebody?

1204
01:02:42,529 --> 01:02:44,019
- Exactly.
- And you saw it?

1205
01:02:44,197 --> 01:02:46,188
- Yes, do you believe me?
- Give me a minute.

1206
01:02:46,366 --> 01:02:49,199
- It was a woman or a man?
- It was a policewoman. A woman.

1207
01:02:49,369 --> 01:02:54,272
- I think I know who that bitch was.
- Yes. I will identify that bitch.

1208
01:02:56,209 --> 01:02:58,643
Thank you so much for believing me,
ma'am. Thank you.

1209
01:02:58,812 --> 01:03:00,871
I'll tell you, I'll get to the bottom of it.

1210
01:03:01,047 --> 01:03:03,311
I'll take this badge off,
get to the bottom of it.

1211
01:03:03,483 --> 01:03:05,644
I don't work for the law.
The law works for me.

1212
01:03:05,819 --> 01:03:07,912
I been smelling something
in this department.

1213
01:03:08,088 --> 01:03:09,453
Keep your eyes on the road.

1214
01:03:09,623 --> 01:03:11,853
- Gonna get to the bottom of this shit.
- Stop!

1215
01:03:13,059 --> 01:03:14,424
Son of a bitch!

1216
01:03:14,594 --> 01:03:18,462
Oh, no. What the hell was that?
What is that?

1217
01:03:24,437 --> 01:03:28,203
No, no, no.

1218
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:31,367
- No. What are you doing?
- I'm saving you, amigo!

1219
01:03:32,746 --> 01:03:34,805
Freeze, goddamn it!
Don't even think about it!

1220
01:03:34,981 --> 01:03:37,541
This is an old-fashioned
escape mission, buddy.

1221
01:03:37,717 --> 01:03:39,514
Stop this car!

1222
01:03:43,123 --> 01:03:45,614
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1223
01:03:45,792 --> 01:03:47,225
Oh, shit!

1224
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:52,799
Oh, shit! It's the lady cop!
That's the murderer! Go!

1225
01:03:52,966 --> 01:03:54,558
- That's the lady cop.
- Who's that?

1226
01:03:54,734 --> 01:03:57,760
I don't know. They're shooting!

1227
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:05,678
Oh, my God, they're shooting!

1228
01:04:05,846 --> 01:04:07,143
Fuck.

1229
01:04:12,118 --> 01:04:13,642
Dude!

1230
01:04:16,423 --> 01:04:17,981
I can't see! The Slushee!

1231
01:04:18,158 --> 01:04:20,319
- Turn on the wipers!
- It's not working!

1232
01:04:20,493 --> 01:04:22,154
Well, kick out the window!

1233
01:04:22,329 --> 01:04:25,093
- How do you drive with one foot?
- I don't know!

1234
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,965
Fuck! I think I pulled my groin!

1235
01:04:32,372 --> 01:04:33,669
Get your foot out of there.

1236
01:04:34,407 --> 01:04:36,500
She's gaining on us.
She's behind us.

1237
01:04:36,676 --> 01:04:37,734
Her car's better.

1238
01:04:37,911 --> 01:04:40,311
- Get your leg out of there. Seriously.
- I can't.

1239
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,381
Put it into maximum overdrive!

1240
01:04:45,852 --> 01:04:47,945
Oh, no, no, no!

1241
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:51,287
Oh, shit!

1242
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:53,153
Get it out!

1243
01:04:55,595 --> 01:04:57,187
I can't see!

1244
01:05:02,569 --> 01:05:06,972
Danger! Danger!
Trees! Tree, tree! Squirrel!

1245
01:05:09,876 --> 01:05:11,468
Hey, I can see
through my leg hole.

1246
01:05:11,645 --> 01:05:13,374
Nice! Look out! Tree, tree, tree!

1247
01:05:16,116 --> 01:05:18,016
You did it, man.

1248
01:05:19,319 --> 01:05:20,809
All right! Look out!

1249
01:05:20,987 --> 01:05:23,046
Oh, shit!

1250
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:25,657
Turn around! Turn around!

1251
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:35,731
I'm scared, Saul. I'm scared.

1252
01:05:35,902 --> 01:05:38,234
- Don't worry. I'm handling this.
- Do something.

1253
01:05:38,405 --> 01:05:40,669
All right, hold on. I got an idea.

1254
01:05:44,177 --> 01:05:47,510
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1255
01:05:48,415 --> 01:05:49,905
Sorry!

1256
01:05:51,217 --> 01:05:52,809
What the fuck was that?

1257
01:05:52,986 --> 01:05:55,216
Fuck. I'm sorry.
I thought she'd just go past.

1258
01:05:55,388 --> 01:05:57,288
- Why?
- I don't know.

1259
01:06:14,274 --> 01:06:15,764
Oh, my.

1260
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,680
Yes! Yes! We made it!
All right, man.

1261
01:06:22,849 --> 01:06:25,545
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- No. What are you doing?

1262
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:28,483
You forgot me, you idiot!
Come back!

1263
01:06:28,655 --> 01:06:31,522
Come back! Saul!

1264
01:06:31,691 --> 01:06:33,056
- Sorry, man.
- Thank you.

1265
01:06:33,226 --> 01:06:37,162
- Let's go.
- Wait. Get the handcuff keys, you idiot.

1266
01:06:39,265 --> 01:06:42,530
As soon as we kill
those sacks of shit tonight, Ted...

1267
01:06:42,702 --> 01:06:44,431
...l'm moving on.

1268
01:06:48,708 --> 01:06:50,300
Okay.

1269
01:06:50,477 --> 01:06:52,035
All right.

1270
01:06:52,846 --> 01:06:56,304
And I promise you
you're gonna be taken care of.

1271
01:06:56,483 --> 01:06:57,745
As sure as shit you will.

1272
01:06:57,917 --> 01:06:59,714
For now, this is what
we're gonna do.

1273
01:06:59,886 --> 01:07:03,378
We're gonna go to the farm tonight,
we're gonna move tonight's shipment.

1274
01:07:03,556 --> 01:07:06,150
Then tomorrow morning,
we're gonna hunt these guys down.

1275
01:07:06,326 --> 01:07:08,817
Dale, Saul, the Asians.
Every last one of them.

1276
01:07:08,995 --> 01:07:11,122
We're gonna fucking kill them all.

1277
01:07:11,631 --> 01:07:13,360
So smile.

1278
01:07:13,533 --> 01:07:15,091
Shut up.

1279
01:07:17,537 --> 01:07:21,871
Say something in Spanish.
Go ahead. I dare you. Go ahead.

1280
01:07:23,243 --> 01:07:25,040
All right. Are you using protection?

1281
01:07:25,211 --> 01:07:26,269
- <i>Days Inn.</i>
- Yes.

1282
01:07:26,446 --> 01:07:28,311
May I have the Garagely room,
please?

1283
01:07:29,149 --> 01:07:31,083
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, is Angie there?</i>

1284
01:07:31,251 --> 01:07:33,082
- Dale.
- <i>Angie?</i>

1285
01:07:33,253 --> 01:07:35,949
- My God, are you okay?
- <i>I'm good. I'm fine. I'm great.</i>

1286
01:07:36,122 --> 01:07:37,453
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- Yes, I'm fine.

1287
01:07:37,624 --> 01:07:39,216
<i>Okay, good. I came up with a plan.</i>

1288
01:07:39,392 --> 01:07:41,553
It might sound weird at first,
but just listen.

1289
01:07:41,728 --> 01:07:44,595
Dale. You know what? Drug dealers...
Let me tell you something.

1290
01:07:44,764 --> 01:07:49,667
Drug dealers are trying to kill me.
And you. And my family.

1291
01:07:49,836 --> 01:07:52,737
<i>I can't believe I'm in this situation</i>
<i>right now because of you...</i>

1292
01:07:52,906 --> 01:07:55,773
...and your addiction to marijuana.
I cannot believe I'm here.

1293
01:07:55,942 --> 01:07:57,466
<i>I can't be addicted to marijuana.</i>

1294
01:07:57,644 --> 01:08:00,807
A, I use a bong. It filters out
the addictive shit. Seriously.

1295
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:03,847
<i>B, what does that have to do with</i>
<i>anything? I witnessed murder.</i>

1296
01:08:04,017 --> 01:08:05,314
And now I'm dealing with it.

1297
01:08:05,485 --> 01:08:07,976
This, that's happening between us,
this is normal.

1298
01:08:08,154 --> 01:08:10,645
This happens to every couple
dating for three months.

1299
01:08:10,824 --> 01:08:12,314
- <i>We have to work through it.</i>
- No.

1300
01:08:12,492 --> 01:08:13,959
This doesn't happen to anyone.

1301
01:08:14,127 --> 01:08:16,595
I should not be in this situation,
so fuck you.

1302
01:08:16,763 --> 01:08:18,060
<i>You know what? It's over.</i>

1303
01:08:18,231 --> 01:08:20,756
Good. Fine. Whatever. It's over.

1304
01:08:20,934 --> 01:08:24,267
Congratulations. Had to happen
sometime, right? Why not now?

1305
01:08:24,437 --> 01:08:25,768
What the fuck does that mean?

1306
01:08:25,939 --> 01:08:28,567
<i>It means that you are gonna go</i>
<i>to college next year.</i>

1307
01:08:28,741 --> 01:08:30,834
<i>You'll get into</i>
<i>Godspeed You! Black Emperor...</i>

1308
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:32,170
<i>... and the fucking Shins.</i>

1309
01:08:32,345 --> 01:08:34,905
<i>And you'll blow a bunch of dudes</i>
<i>and become a lesbian...</i>

1310
01:08:35,081 --> 01:08:37,811
<i>... and I'll be here in fucking</i>
<i>Clark County doing shit-all.</i>

1311
01:08:37,984 --> 01:08:40,384
<i>You're gonna dump me.</i>
<i>So, fuck it, have a good time.</i>

1312
01:08:40,553 --> 01:08:42,646
A lesbian? Fuck you, Dale!

1313
01:08:42,822 --> 01:08:44,551
<i>You never did like me anyway,</i>
<i>did you?</i>

1314
01:08:44,724 --> 01:08:46,248
<i>You didn't wanna meet my parents.</i>

1315
01:08:46,426 --> 01:08:49,020
I always cared about you.
That's not what this is. Okay?

1316
01:08:49,195 --> 01:08:50,423
I always care about you.

1317
01:08:50,597 --> 01:08:52,428
Why don't you ever act like it, huh?

1318
01:08:52,599 --> 01:08:55,033
Why do you never act
like you care about anything?

1319
01:08:55,201 --> 01:08:59,331
Because I'm high! Fuck! And it...
What do you want...? Okay. Jesus.

1320
01:08:59,506 --> 01:09:01,531
Call me when I can go home.

1321
01:09:02,442 --> 01:09:06,936
You lost it playing Bid Whist?
You pimp.

1322
01:09:07,113 --> 01:09:10,344
No, I'll give you more,
but you cannot gamble with it.

1323
01:09:11,017 --> 01:09:13,212
I know, I'm sorry about the clocks.

1324
01:09:13,386 --> 01:09:17,516
I couldn't remember if it was today
or tomorrow. All right, I gotta go.

1325
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:19,214
I love you.

1326
01:09:19,392 --> 01:09:21,553
You wise-ass.

1327
01:09:22,395 --> 01:09:25,159
Hey, you all right, man?
That sounded pretty hectic.

1328
01:09:25,331 --> 01:09:27,731
I'm okay.
Let's just get the fuck out of here.

1329
01:09:27,901 --> 01:09:28,993
First things first.

1330
01:09:30,937 --> 01:09:34,373
- Don't do that, okay?
- Yeah. Why not?

1331
01:09:34,541 --> 01:09:36,702
Why not? Car chase, gunshots.

1332
01:09:36,876 --> 01:09:38,309
That clearly just happened...

1333
01:09:38,478 --> 01:09:40,844
...because we were smoking
marijuana.

1334
01:09:41,014 --> 01:09:42,982
No, man. It happened
because those kids...

1335
01:09:43,149 --> 01:09:45,310
...couldn't keep their shit
on the down-low.

1336
01:09:45,485 --> 01:09:48,352
In case you haven't noticed...
Which you haven't.

1337
01:09:48,521 --> 01:09:50,989
From what I can tell,
you don't notice anything ever.

1338
01:09:51,157 --> 01:09:54,524
- we are not very functional when
we're high. Which is all the time.

1339
01:09:54,694 --> 01:09:57,424
Well, I don't know, man.
I think I'm functioning right now.

1340
01:09:57,597 --> 01:10:00,430
I was, like, stoned when I saved you
with those Slushees.

1341
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,033
What do you gotta say to that?

1342
01:10:02,202 --> 01:10:04,762
Well, that would be true
if you had saved me.

1343
01:10:04,938 --> 01:10:06,064
But you didn't save me.

1344
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:08,139
She was gonna help,
you made things worse.

1345
01:10:08,308 --> 01:10:10,173
We're wanted
for all sorts of crazy shit.

1346
01:10:10,343 --> 01:10:12,334
Don't fucking get on my case,
all right?

1347
01:10:12,512 --> 01:10:14,173
Only reason I started selling pot...

1348
01:10:14,347 --> 01:10:16,941
...is so I could put my <i>bubbe</i>
in a nice retirement home.

1349
01:10:17,116 --> 01:10:19,277
- She must be proud of you.
- She is proud of me.

1350
01:10:19,452 --> 01:10:20,783
I'm gonna become something.

1351
01:10:20,954 --> 01:10:23,479
As soon as she dies,
I'm gonna become a civil engineer.

1352
01:10:23,656 --> 01:10:25,988
I'm gonna design septic tanks
for playgrounds.

1353
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:27,649
Little kids can take shits.

1354
01:10:27,827 --> 01:10:29,454
You idiot. What the hell do you do?

1355
01:10:29,629 --> 01:10:31,722
What am I gonna do?
Besides stay in my home...

1356
01:10:31,898 --> 01:10:34,458
...for fear that you've designed
some object I'm around?

1357
01:10:34,634 --> 01:10:37,831
I'm gonna be on the radio,
talking about life.

1358
01:10:38,004 --> 01:10:40,438
- Giving lessons about life.
- Put me in my place.

1359
01:10:40,607 --> 01:10:43,098
I'm gonna be designing buildings
and what's he doing?

1360
01:10:43,276 --> 01:10:45,107
Boring people to death on the radio.

1361
01:10:45,278 --> 01:10:48,873
You are an asshole.
That's all you are. You're an asshole.

1362
01:10:49,048 --> 01:10:50,913
- I'm not an asshole.
- You are an asshole.

1363
01:10:51,084 --> 01:10:54,053
I feel pretty sure
that I'm not an asshole.

1364
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:55,847
I'm, like, a totally nice guy.

1365
01:10:56,022 --> 01:10:58,513
I'm just as nice as you are.
So don't bring that out.

1366
01:10:58,691 --> 01:11:00,488
In the woods, I gave you my jacket.

1367
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:02,992
You were cold and I clothed you.

1368
01:11:03,463 --> 01:11:06,762
How about in the park
when I said that you were my friend?

1369
01:11:06,933 --> 01:11:08,560
You didn't say anything back.

1370
01:11:08,735 --> 01:11:11,295
Well, that's easy.
It's because we're not friends.

1371
01:11:11,471 --> 01:11:12,938
You are my drug dealer.

1372
01:11:13,106 --> 01:11:14,835
There's one reason
we know each other.

1373
01:11:15,008 --> 01:11:17,033
I like the drugs you sell. That's it.

1374
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:20,441
If you didn't sell those drugs,
I would have no idea who you were...

1375
01:11:20,613 --> 01:11:23,741
...and I would be fantastic right now.
Instead of looking like this.

1376
01:11:25,718 --> 01:11:28,710
That sounded mean.
Just hearing it sounded mean.

1377
01:11:28,888 --> 01:11:30,446
- I didn't mean to say...
- It's out.

1378
01:11:30,623 --> 01:11:33,057
Monkey's out of the bottle, man.

1379
01:11:33,226 --> 01:11:35,251
What? That's not even
an expression.

1380
01:11:35,428 --> 01:11:38,158
Pandora doesn't go back in the box.
He only comes out.

1381
01:11:38,331 --> 01:11:40,196
I'm sorry, man. Look...

1382
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:44,159
- What are you doing?
- Here. Have a nice last meal.

1383
01:11:44,337 --> 01:11:46,897
Come on, man. Don't do that.

1384
01:11:47,073 --> 01:11:49,166
Why don't you supersize it, bitch?

1385
01:11:49,342 --> 01:11:51,742
I'm sorry, man. Look, come back.

1386
01:11:51,911 --> 01:11:54,141
I didn't mean that.

1387
01:12:06,559 --> 01:12:09,323
<i>I love you. Do you love me?</i>

1388
01:12:52,305 --> 01:12:53,932
That looks great.

1389
01:13:01,581 --> 01:13:03,014
Hello?

1390
01:13:04,117 --> 01:13:05,414
Dale?

1391
01:13:05,585 --> 01:13:06,950
<i>It is Dale.</i>

1392
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:11,989
Angie, I'm calling because I love you
more than anything in the world...

1393
01:13:12,158 --> 01:13:15,594
...and I wanna let you know
I'll do anything to make it work.

1394
01:13:15,762 --> 01:13:17,491
<i>I'll do anything.</i>

1395
01:13:17,663 --> 01:13:21,258
I've had a near-death experience,
and when that happens...

1396
01:13:21,434 --> 01:13:24,130
...you can prioritize your life,
and you are it, okay?

1397
01:13:24,303 --> 01:13:26,464
<i>So please</i>
<i>just take me back, please.</i>

1398
01:13:26,639 --> 01:13:28,732
- <i>I love you.</i>
- I love you.

1399
01:13:30,109 --> 01:13:33,044
- Yeah?
- <i>I just don't wanna lose you, Dale.</i>

1400
01:13:33,212 --> 01:13:36,670
We were driving away from the house
and I just kept thinking...

1401
01:13:36,849 --> 01:13:38,077
I don't know. I just...

1402
01:13:38,251 --> 01:13:39,650
I wanna marry you.

1403
01:13:42,755 --> 01:13:44,416
I made a mistake.

1404
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:46,922
- <i>What do you mean?</i>
- I've...

1405
01:13:47,326 --> 01:13:49,726
- What?
- <i>I'm just processing that last bit.</i>

1406
01:13:49,896 --> 01:13:52,490
- <i>You wanna... Oh, fuck.</i>
- What?

1407
01:13:52,665 --> 01:13:54,223
I don't know.

1408
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,527
I realize now
that if you would take me back...

1409
01:13:56,702 --> 01:13:58,636
...then you are very naive
and immature.

1410
01:13:58,805 --> 01:14:02,366
You don't see what a fuck-up I am.
I'm in no shape to be dated by anyone.

1411
01:14:02,542 --> 01:14:05,670
- You're the one that's immature.
- <i>I'm not immature. You're immature.</i>

1412
01:14:05,845 --> 01:14:09,042
<i>I am somewhat immature,</i>
<i>but you're more immature. I'm older.</i>

1413
01:14:09,215 --> 01:14:10,512
Just because you're older.

1414
01:14:10,683 --> 01:14:13,208
I lost my virginity
when I was 14 years old.

1415
01:14:13,386 --> 01:14:15,547
- <i>Really?</i>
- How many girls have you slept with?

1416
01:14:15,721 --> 01:14:17,814
- Like, two and a half.
- <i>Two and a half?</i>

1417
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:19,184
What is a half? Your hand?

1418
01:14:19,358 --> 01:14:22,293
<i>No, it was the tip or I dipped a ball in.</i>
<i>I can't remember why.</i>

1419
01:14:22,462 --> 01:14:25,124
<i>I remember thinking,</i>
<i>"This doesn't count as a full point."</i>

1420
01:14:25,298 --> 01:14:27,664
<i>If I said three, I'd feel like a liar.</i>
<i>I was drunk.</i>

1421
01:14:27,834 --> 01:14:29,165
<i>Screw you.</i>

1422
01:14:29,335 --> 01:14:30,495
Get me out of this room.

1423
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:33,730
<i>I will, and that's the last</i>
<i>you'll ever hear from me, okay?</i>

1424
01:14:35,908 --> 01:14:39,708
Oh, thank goodness. Okay.

1425
01:14:42,915 --> 01:14:45,213
Belogus. Faye Belogus.

1426
01:14:46,652 --> 01:14:47,949
Lookit there. Lookit there.

1427
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,951
Do you use the pool over here?

1428
01:14:50,122 --> 01:14:52,886
Yes, I use the pool. Come on,
what do you want from me?

1429
01:14:53,059 --> 01:14:56,256
Your grandson. We need you to get
on the phone with your grandson...

1430
01:14:56,429 --> 01:14:58,363
What are you talking about,
my grandson?

1431
01:14:58,531 --> 01:15:01,261
You told me you wanna sit down,
play dominos with me.

1432
01:15:01,434 --> 01:15:03,425
And now you're hocking me
about my grandson.

1433
01:15:03,603 --> 01:15:06,265
- Is that Yiddish?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

1434
01:15:06,439 --> 01:15:07,565
May I call you Faye?

1435
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:10,868
You can call me Faye,
but I'm gonna call you a stinker.

1436
01:15:11,043 --> 01:15:12,567
Hey, Mrs. Mendelson.

1437
01:15:12,745 --> 01:15:14,269
What do you want from me?

1438
01:15:14,447 --> 01:15:15,812
<i>Bubbe.</i> Hey, guys.

1439
01:15:15,982 --> 01:15:18,473
- Well, look who it is.
- Hello, baby.

1440
01:15:22,588 --> 01:15:23,612
Damn.

1441
01:15:24,557 --> 01:15:25,888
Oh, shit.

1442
01:15:26,058 --> 01:15:27,650
Sorry, Betty.

1443
01:15:32,064 --> 01:15:34,430
They kidnapped my grandson.

1444
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,500
Yeah, these two guys came in...

1445
01:15:36,669 --> 01:15:39,661
...they sat down with me
to play dominos.

1446
01:15:39,839 --> 01:15:41,932
I never saw them in my life before.

1447
01:15:42,108 --> 01:15:45,271
And they kept asking questions
about my grandson.

1448
01:15:45,444 --> 01:15:49,904
- What did they look like?
- One of them was very tall and sloppy.

1449
01:15:50,082 --> 01:15:53,848
And the other guy,
he was very good-looking...

1450
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:55,351
...but he was short as shit.

1451
01:15:55,521 --> 01:15:57,455
But the worst part was...

1452
01:15:57,623 --> 01:16:01,992
...that my grandson came in,
why, and in pajamas.

1453
01:16:02,161 --> 01:16:04,152
- You gotta find my grandson.
- Do the best...

1454
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:05,592
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

1455
01:16:05,765 --> 01:16:07,630
Absolutely.
You've got something there.

1456
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,324
I believe that's a mole, ma'am.

1457
01:16:15,007 --> 01:16:18,204
You sack of shit. Do you know
what a pain in the ass you've been?

1458
01:16:18,377 --> 01:16:20,140
No, man. I don't wanna get out.

1459
01:16:20,313 --> 01:16:23,146
Who gave you that lollipop?
Let's go.

1460
01:16:23,316 --> 01:16:25,511
Where am I, man? What?

1461
01:16:25,685 --> 01:16:29,143
You guys started it, man.
I don't even wanna be here.

1462
01:16:29,322 --> 01:16:30,653
Shit. Did I do that?

1463
01:16:32,325 --> 01:16:35,317
Hey, hey. All right, okay.

1464
01:16:35,962 --> 01:16:37,827
Fuck you, man!

1465
01:16:37,997 --> 01:16:40,693
- Stand back. Ted wants him alive.
- Why you holding me back?

1466
01:16:40,866 --> 01:16:42,197
Ted wants him alive, okay?

1467
01:16:42,368 --> 01:16:44,359
I should be kicking
his fucking teeth in.

1468
01:16:44,537 --> 01:16:47,938
- If anybody's gonna beat him, it's Ted.
- I look like Hamburglar.

1469
01:16:48,107 --> 01:16:49,131
And the Elephant Man.

1470
01:16:49,308 --> 01:16:51,503
Like someone fucked you up
with a coffee pot.

1471
01:16:51,677 --> 01:16:53,406
Professional. Professional.

1472
01:16:53,579 --> 01:16:55,706
- Professional on this, bitch.
- Whatever, man.

1473
01:16:55,881 --> 01:16:58,008
- Where were you?
- I was there.

1474
01:16:58,184 --> 01:17:00,049
- Supposed to be my partner.
- I was there.

1475
01:17:00,219 --> 01:17:01,880
No, you wasn't.
How did this happen?

1476
01:17:02,054 --> 01:17:04,249
I take the hit?
That's how it's gonna be?

1477
01:17:04,423 --> 01:17:06,823
Fuck all this, you know?
Get him out of here.

1478
01:17:06,993 --> 01:17:10,224
Take him downstairs.
Get this asshole out of my sight.

1479
01:17:10,396 --> 01:17:12,557
I don't wanna go near this guy.

1480
01:17:12,732 --> 01:17:15,701
What's down there?
Fucking rancor?

1481
01:17:15,868 --> 01:17:17,495
I might act tough...

1482
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:19,729
...but I got a lot of feelings.

1483
01:17:20,139 --> 01:17:23,040
And you hurt damn near
every one of them.

1484
01:17:24,076 --> 01:17:25,771
This ain't over.

1485
01:17:26,245 --> 01:17:28,110
- You know you gonna die, right?
- Yeah.

1486
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,339
I'm gonna kill the fuck out of you.

1487
01:17:30,516 --> 01:17:33,781
I hope you enjoy these last
17 minutes of your life...

1488
01:17:33,953 --> 01:17:36,217
...because when Ted gets here,
he's gonna be like:

1489
01:17:36,389 --> 01:17:39,449
"Kill that motherfucker."
I'm gonna kill your motherfucking ass.

1490
01:17:39,625 --> 01:17:40,649
Watch your head.

1491
01:17:42,595 --> 01:17:44,392
Hey, watch him.

1492
01:17:46,232 --> 01:17:47,460
Oh, my God.

1493
01:17:47,633 --> 01:17:49,965
El Dorado.

1494
01:17:50,302 --> 01:17:52,532
The legends are true.

1495
01:17:53,139 --> 01:17:55,334
Look at all this weed, man.

1496
01:17:55,508 --> 01:17:57,237
What's that? Purple Granddaddy?

1497
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:59,776
- Come on.
- Purple Nurple?

1498
01:17:59,945 --> 01:18:01,742
OG Kush?

1499
01:18:01,914 --> 01:18:03,245
OG Kush.

1500
01:18:10,423 --> 01:18:13,051
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1501
01:18:13,225 --> 01:18:14,886
- What kind of irrigation...?
- Shut up.

1502
01:18:15,061 --> 01:18:16,961
- Can I touch it?
- Come here.

1503
01:18:32,344 --> 01:18:34,141
Hello?

1504
01:18:34,313 --> 01:18:35,712
Red?

1505
01:18:41,887 --> 01:18:43,787
- Red?
- What the fuck?

1506
01:18:43,956 --> 01:18:46,754
Get out of here, man.
I didn't do shit, Denton.

1507
01:18:46,926 --> 01:18:50,020
Look, I come in peace, okay?
I'm not here to fight you again.

1508
01:18:50,196 --> 01:18:51,629
Good.

1509
01:18:51,797 --> 01:18:54,527
Because I'm tired, man.
Not feeling so hot.

1510
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,565
You don't look great.

1511
01:18:56,736 --> 01:18:58,260
They shot me, Denton.

1512
01:18:58,437 --> 01:18:59,734
They got me right here.

1513
01:18:59,905 --> 01:19:01,236
- Yeah?
- Right here.

1514
01:19:01,407 --> 01:19:03,204
And then they got me again
right here.

1515
01:19:03,375 --> 01:19:06,606
Look, man, I'll call 911 right now.

1516
01:19:06,779 --> 01:19:08,303
They'll save your life, okay?

1517
01:19:08,481 --> 01:19:10,381
- You don't need to die.
- No, bro.

1518
01:19:10,549 --> 01:19:13,177
You don't get it.
It doesn't really matter where I'm at.

1519
01:19:13,352 --> 01:19:15,616
If I'm at the hospital, if I'm here...

1520
01:19:15,788 --> 01:19:17,881
...Ted's gonna find me, man.
He will.

1521
01:19:18,057 --> 01:19:20,992
And when he does,
he's gonna fucking kill me.

1522
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,787
He's just, like, an asshole.

1523
01:19:22,962 --> 01:19:25,897
I couldn't agree more, Red.
That's why I've come here, okay?

1524
01:19:26,065 --> 01:19:27,930
You know Ted? He took Saul.

1525
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:29,465
And I'm gonna get him back.

1526
01:19:29,635 --> 01:19:31,626
You know, like, he saved my life.

1527
01:19:31,804 --> 01:19:34,932
We've been on the run together.
He's a great friend. A good guy.

1528
01:19:35,107 --> 01:19:37,940
He is. I'll tell you that, man.
Saul is a good dude.

1529
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:39,168
I was mean to him, man.

1530
01:19:39,345 --> 01:19:42,075
I wronged him and I can't...
I can't let it end like that.

1531
01:19:42,248 --> 01:19:45,911
I'm just into Buddhism
and I'm at peace with the fact...

1532
01:19:46,085 --> 01:19:49,987
...that me as this person,
probably gonna not be around.

1533
01:19:50,156 --> 01:19:52,090
Think about a hermit crab, okay?

1534
01:19:52,258 --> 01:19:56,217
And it's a shell, and it's like
they go from one shell to the next.

1535
01:19:56,395 --> 01:20:00,525
And that's what I am. It's like
I'm just a hermit crab changing shells.

1536
01:20:00,699 --> 01:20:03,065
Except, if you're a dick
your whole life...

1537
01:20:03,235 --> 01:20:06,102
...your next shell
will be made of shit, okay?

1538
01:20:06,272 --> 01:20:09,036
If you're an asshole, you're gonna
come back as a cockroach.

1539
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:12,939
Or a worm,
or a fucking anal bead, okay?

1540
01:20:13,112 --> 01:20:15,512
If you're a man,
and you act heroic...

1541
01:20:15,681 --> 01:20:17,239
...you'll come back as an eagle.

1542
01:20:17,416 --> 01:20:18,974
You'll come back as a dragon.

1543
01:20:19,151 --> 01:20:20,812
You'll come back as Jude Law.

1544
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:23,815
Okay? Which would you rather be?

1545
01:20:23,989 --> 01:20:27,322
Maybe the anal bead. Might...
Depending on who it belongs to.

1546
01:20:27,493 --> 01:20:28,517
It belongs to me.

1547
01:20:28,694 --> 01:20:30,127
- Then the dragon.
- Exactly.

1548
01:20:30,296 --> 01:20:34,130
You need to help me, okay?
Just use it, you know? Use the pain.

1549
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,528
You'll have a second wind.

1550
01:20:35,701 --> 01:20:38,101
Let's get up
and go get Saul back. Use it.

1551
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:40,932
- Aren't you angry at Ted?
- Yeah, I'm really mad at him.

1552
01:20:41,106 --> 01:20:44,269
What do you wanna do? Don't you
wanna get up, do something about it?

1553
01:20:44,443 --> 01:20:46,741
Maybe that would be cool
to do to him.

1554
01:20:46,912 --> 01:20:48,573
I don't think "maybe" is the answer.

1555
01:20:48,747 --> 01:20:51,045
I think, "Yes, I'm gonna
help you, Dale"...

1556
01:20:51,217 --> 01:20:52,980
...that's the answer I'm looking for.

1557
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:55,985
Come here.

1558
01:20:59,191 --> 01:21:02,888
Ted Jones messed
with the wrong melon farmers.

1559
01:21:05,364 --> 01:21:07,423
Thug life.

1560
01:21:13,405 --> 01:21:14,633
Oh, shit.

1561
01:21:14,807 --> 01:21:17,537
Get those. I don't wanna
run them over in the vacuum...

1562
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:19,769
...and shoot my face off, okay?
- I'm sorry.

1563
01:21:26,752 --> 01:21:29,448
I used to use this little gun
when I was a prostitute.

1564
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:36,360
Don't.

1565
01:21:36,528 --> 01:21:37,552
Don't.

1566
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:39,391
Just something quick like that.

1567
01:21:39,565 --> 01:21:41,055
- Don't.
- Yeah.

1568
01:21:41,233 --> 01:21:43,360
- Don't. You stop it right now.
- Stop it.

1569
01:21:56,649 --> 01:21:58,480
Oh, God.

1570
01:22:01,153 --> 01:22:03,212
That's a big hideout.

1571
01:22:05,157 --> 01:22:07,182
I can't do this. I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

1572
01:22:07,359 --> 01:22:10,328
I'm infected. My shit's all fucked up.
I need medical attention.

1573
01:22:10,496 --> 01:22:13,397
What? I thought we just got all
pumped up. What was that about?

1574
01:22:13,565 --> 01:22:15,999
Ted is a fucking murderer.
I can't fuck with him.

1575
01:22:16,168 --> 01:22:18,261
I got a wife.
She's gonna be out of jail soon.

1576
01:22:18,437 --> 01:22:21,338
I wanna fuck her. I am not gonna
wake up murdered tomorrow.

1577
01:22:21,507 --> 01:22:23,668
Oh, man, no.
This is lame of you, man.

1578
01:22:23,842 --> 01:22:26,208
Come on. This could be
your moment of redemption.

1579
01:22:26,378 --> 01:22:27,572
This could be your moment.

1580
01:22:27,746 --> 01:22:30,306
I don't want a moment.
I don't want... Fine, go.

1581
01:22:30,482 --> 01:22:31,506
Fuck you.

1582
01:22:31,684 --> 01:22:33,845
Please come back for me.
Please come back.

1583
01:22:34,019 --> 01:22:38,217
Legends never die, dude.
I'll tell your story.

1584
01:22:38,924 --> 01:22:41,791
Carol, she's cool now.

1585
01:22:41,961 --> 01:22:45,897
Carol used to be a little crazy, man.
She used to throw tickle parties.

1586
01:22:46,065 --> 01:22:48,363
- Sounds like home-cooking to me.
- That was fun.

1587
01:22:48,534 --> 01:22:50,934
Game over, motherfuckers!
Everybody freeze!

1588
01:22:51,103 --> 01:22:53,401
Tell me where my friend is
or this guy gets it!

1589
01:22:53,572 --> 01:22:55,802
All right, everybody be cool, man.
Be cool.

1590
01:22:55,975 --> 01:22:57,499
Put your guns down.
Nobody shoots.

1591
01:22:57,676 --> 01:22:59,268
Put them down. On the ground.

1592
01:22:59,445 --> 01:23:01,811
All right, everybody just chill.

1593
01:23:01,981 --> 01:23:03,881
Oh, my God!

1594
01:23:04,049 --> 01:23:05,710
- You shot him.
- Put the gun down.

1595
01:23:05,884 --> 01:23:08,409
- Drop the fucking gun.
- Don't shoot me!

1596
01:23:08,587 --> 01:23:10,885
- Holy shit.
- I said, nobody shoot. You shot Pete.

1597
01:23:11,056 --> 01:23:12,853
That's right. I shot him. I shot him.

1598
01:23:13,025 --> 01:23:15,755
I shot him. I don't have time
for a fucking negotiation.

1599
01:23:15,928 --> 01:23:18,419
Now, I wanna finish this off
so I can go home...

1600
01:23:18,597 --> 01:23:20,531
...and have dinner
with my wife for once.

1601
01:23:20,699 --> 01:23:22,826
If anybody asks, Denton killed Pete.

1602
01:23:23,002 --> 01:23:24,799
End of story.

1603
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:26,995
I'm telling Ted.

1604
01:23:27,172 --> 01:23:28,935
- If you do...
- He's got a piece.

1605
01:23:29,108 --> 01:23:30,700
- Motherfucker.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

1606
01:23:30,876 --> 01:23:32,537
He's got another one, in the side.

1607
01:23:32,711 --> 01:23:34,303
Damn it. I got one more on my leg.

1608
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,744
There's one more.
I know you'll find it. Take it.

1609
01:23:36,915 --> 01:23:39,076
I'm sorry, guys.
Sorry I deceived you.

1610
01:23:39,251 --> 01:23:40,479
No. Come on.

1611
01:23:43,555 --> 01:23:46,023
- Oh, great.
- Saul.

1612
01:23:46,191 --> 01:23:47,283
- Dale.
- Yes.

1613
01:23:47,459 --> 01:23:50,622
What did you do, rat me out?
Is that what you did, you bastard?

1614
01:23:50,796 --> 01:23:52,661
- No, man.
- Yes.

1615
01:23:52,831 --> 01:23:54,526
I'm here to save you.

1616
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:57,362
No. You just got caught too.

1617
01:23:57,536 --> 01:23:59,902
And I'm gonna die in here
with some asshole.

1618
01:24:00,072 --> 01:24:02,131
Okay, you know what?
I deserved that.

1619
01:24:02,307 --> 01:24:05,140
I'll take that because
I have been an asshole, man.

1620
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:08,473
This whole thing is my fault.
I ruined your life.

1621
01:24:08,881 --> 01:24:11,850
Okay? And I know there's no way...

1622
01:24:12,017 --> 01:24:14,451
...to make that up to you
except by saving your life.

1623
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:17,680
So that's what I came here to do.
I'm here to save my best friend.

1624
01:24:17,856 --> 01:24:20,381
Because that's what you are.
You're my best friend.

1625
01:24:20,559 --> 01:24:22,288
You're a mean jerk.

1626
01:24:22,461 --> 01:24:25,430
I was mean.
I was mean because, I think...

1627
01:24:25,597 --> 01:24:27,827
I didn't want
you to be my best friend.

1628
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,696
I didn't wanna think
that that's what my life was.

1629
01:24:30,869 --> 01:24:33,337
Now I realize I'm lucky
to have you as my best friend.

1630
01:24:33,505 --> 01:24:34,995
You're the best guy I know.

1631
01:24:35,707 --> 01:24:37,004
BFFF.

1632
01:24:37,176 --> 01:24:39,610
Best fucking friends forever, man.
Seriously.

1633
01:24:42,948 --> 01:24:45,143
- All right. Give me a hug.
- Yeah. Okay.

1634
01:24:45,317 --> 01:24:47,717
Thanks, man.
I'm so sorry about everything.

1635
01:24:47,886 --> 01:24:49,217
Oh, I'm such a dick.

1636
01:24:49,388 --> 01:24:52,551
- Okay. I'm gonna get us out.
- No, you're not, but it's okay.

1637
01:24:52,724 --> 01:24:55,625
These guys are gonna fucking kill us.
We gotta get out of here.

1638
01:24:55,794 --> 01:24:57,523
- I know. They are.
- Fuck, man.

1639
01:24:57,696 --> 01:25:02,030
We can hear you outside and
it's very fucking annoying, all right?

1640
01:25:02,201 --> 01:25:04,761
- Okay. Sorry about that, sir.
- Shut the fuck up.

1641
01:25:04,937 --> 01:25:07,064
Do you know
what "shut the fuck up" mean?

1642
01:25:07,239 --> 01:25:08,729
I do.

1643
01:25:08,907 --> 01:25:10,704
Shit. Stupid motherfuckers.

1644
01:25:11,477 --> 01:25:14,810
Yes. Okay. I got an idea. I got an idea.
My belt buckle. My belt buckle.

1645
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:18,438
Right here. Okay? Rub your wrists
against my belt buckle. That'll do it.

1646
01:25:19,818 --> 01:25:21,410
- Is it working?
- I can't feel it.

1647
01:25:21,587 --> 01:25:22,611
I can't feel you.

1648
01:25:22,788 --> 01:25:24,722
- Wait, I feel it.
- I feel it. Yes, okay.

1649
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:26,289
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

1650
01:25:26,458 --> 01:25:28,551
- I'm gonna save you, man.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1651
01:25:28,727 --> 01:25:30,490
- Let me save you.
- Save me, Dale.

1652
01:25:30,662 --> 01:25:32,527
It's not working.
We gotta change angles.

1653
01:25:32,698 --> 01:25:34,928
We gotta
get more leverage-y. Okay.

1654
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:36,590
Okay, that's good. That's good.

1655
01:25:36,768 --> 01:25:38,702
Get your hands up on it.
There we go.

1656
01:25:38,871 --> 01:25:40,964
- All right. All right.
- Yeah. Okay.

1657
01:25:42,074 --> 01:25:44,201
- Yes. Yes.
- Okay.

1658
01:25:44,376 --> 01:25:46,776
I'm gonna save you, man.
I'm gonna save you.

1659
01:25:46,945 --> 01:25:49,243
- You're my best friend, man.
- Yeah, see?

1660
01:25:49,414 --> 01:25:52,508
- It's not working.
- Let me use my... I'll use my mouth.

1661
01:25:52,684 --> 01:25:54,652
Finish it off with my mouth, pal.
Let's go.

1662
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:56,913
Come on. Let's go.

1663
01:25:57,089 --> 01:25:58,954
Harder.

1664
01:26:07,566 --> 01:26:09,966
- Where are these fuckers?
- We got them downstairs.

1665
01:26:10,135 --> 01:26:12,831
- Where did you find them?
- Found Saul at his grandmother's.

1666
01:26:13,005 --> 01:26:15,906
He fucked up Matheson's face.
Hit him with a pot of hot coffee.

1667
01:26:16,074 --> 01:26:17,507
It's gross.

1668
01:26:17,676 --> 01:26:19,940
Dale Denton comes flying in here
like a madman...

1669
01:26:20,112 --> 01:26:23,912
...armed to the teeth, and,
as you can see, he shot Peter.

1670
01:26:24,082 --> 01:26:26,277
Plugged him, just whacked him.

1671
01:26:26,451 --> 01:26:29,682
Now they're both disarmed
and they're downstairs.

1672
01:26:29,855 --> 01:26:31,413
He shot Pete?

1673
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:33,581
Fucking Pete? He was ex-CIA.

1674
01:26:33,759 --> 01:26:36,284
Who the fuck is this Dale Denton?

1675
01:26:36,461 --> 01:26:39,760
Who is he? Where did he come from?
I do not know.

1676
01:26:44,303 --> 01:26:46,362
Time to cook shit up tonight.

1677
01:26:46,538 --> 01:26:48,563
Take his stash and burn
this motherfucker down.

1678
01:26:49,942 --> 01:26:51,842
Stop. Wait here.

1679
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:54,774
No retreat, no surrender.

1680
01:27:00,252 --> 01:27:01,276
Yes, yes, yes.

1681
01:27:01,453 --> 01:27:04,286
- Wait, someone's coming.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1682
01:27:04,456 --> 01:27:07,857
If I cough once, I'll take the lead.
If I cough twice, you go, okay?

1683
01:27:08,026 --> 01:27:10,221
Well... I cough sometimes for real.

1684
01:27:10,395 --> 01:27:12,295
Just don't. Don't...

1685
01:27:17,903 --> 01:27:20,963
Yo, look. I'm gonna say this
one time.

1686
01:27:21,139 --> 01:27:25,235
Whatever you're doing,
I get it, okay?

1687
01:27:25,410 --> 01:27:26,900
Stop.

1688
01:27:30,282 --> 01:27:32,842
See, I don't think
you understood me.

1689
01:27:33,018 --> 01:27:34,849
I can hear everything you're saying.

1690
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:37,716
One cough mean you go.
Two cough mean you take the lead.

1691
01:27:37,889 --> 01:27:40,380
The belt buckle.
Best friends forever.

1692
01:27:40,559 --> 01:27:42,823
Y'all fuck on your own time, man.

1693
01:27:42,995 --> 01:27:44,553
Sorry, man. It was a stupid plan.

1694
01:27:44,730 --> 01:27:47,164
What the fuck is that?

1695
01:27:49,468 --> 01:27:50,492
Dale!

1696
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:58,041
I've been waiting for this.
You burned my face!

1697
01:28:00,345 --> 01:28:02,677
I'm gonna tear this ass up.

1698
01:28:09,187 --> 01:28:10,677
You shot me.

1699
01:28:10,856 --> 01:28:12,221
I'm sorry, man.

1700
01:28:12,391 --> 01:28:16,088
I've never been shot.
Damn, that hurt.

1701
01:28:16,261 --> 01:28:17,888
I got glass in my ass.

1702
01:28:18,063 --> 01:28:20,657
- Dale. Dale!
- This is messed up.

1703
01:28:20,832 --> 01:28:22,925
Has anyone seen my bigger knife?

1704
01:28:25,270 --> 01:28:27,329
Asians!

1705
01:28:32,344 --> 01:28:33,311
War is upon you!

1706
01:28:33,478 --> 01:28:35,275
Prepare to suck the cock of karma!

1707
01:28:41,453 --> 01:28:42,545
Get down, motherfucker!

1708
01:28:47,092 --> 01:28:48,320
Come on!

1709
01:28:51,029 --> 01:28:52,257
Fuck!

1710
01:29:01,673 --> 01:29:03,004
Go! Go!

1711
01:29:03,175 --> 01:29:04,335
Get down, baby!

1712
01:29:04,509 --> 01:29:06,238
Dale, no!

1713
01:29:06,411 --> 01:29:08,038
No, wake up, man.

1714
01:29:08,213 --> 01:29:10,078
No, you're not dying, man.

1715
01:29:10,248 --> 01:29:12,808
Not without me.

1716
01:29:12,984 --> 01:29:14,315
- Dale.
- What?

1717
01:29:14,486 --> 01:29:16,317
You're alive.

1718
01:29:16,488 --> 01:29:20,015
- You're... You're alive.
- What happened?

1719
01:29:20,592 --> 01:29:22,651
- He got your ear, man.
- He got my what?

1720
01:29:22,828 --> 01:29:25,558
- He got your ear.
- Fuck!

1721
01:29:26,698 --> 01:29:28,325
Fuck!

1722
01:29:30,602 --> 01:29:32,092
- Help!
- My ear.

1723
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:33,294
- Yeah.
- Help!

1724
01:29:33,472 --> 01:29:35,565
- You killed my ear.
- You shot me.

1725
01:29:35,741 --> 01:29:37,641
- I didn't do that.
- He shot me.

1726
01:29:37,809 --> 01:29:38,833
You shot him?

1727
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:41,240
- Get your hands off of me.
- Shut up.

1728
01:29:41,413 --> 01:29:43,040
We've had enough out of you.

1729
01:29:43,215 --> 01:29:44,443
I'm not your friend.

1730
01:29:44,616 --> 01:29:45,981
Maybe I can just...

1731
01:29:46,151 --> 01:29:48,142
No. No, infected.

1732
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,720
Is that it? Maybe if we just hold it.

1733
01:30:25,223 --> 01:30:26,884
It's clear.

1734
01:30:27,826 --> 01:30:30,158
Dude. Look.

1735
01:30:30,328 --> 01:30:31,886
Nice.

1736
01:30:44,242 --> 01:30:45,766
Bullets.

1737
01:30:53,919 --> 01:30:56,752
So seriously,
how gross does my ear look?

1738
01:30:56,922 --> 01:31:00,255
Is it really disgusting
or is it, like, kind of cool in a way?

1739
01:31:00,425 --> 01:31:02,484
Right now it's pretty disgusting.

1740
01:31:02,661 --> 01:31:04,629
I feel like I can smell it.

1741
01:31:04,796 --> 01:31:07,264
Don't worry, bro.
Think about Evander Holyfield.

1742
01:31:07,432 --> 01:31:08,490
You can't even tell.

1743
01:31:08,667 --> 01:31:09,759
That's a good point.

1744
01:31:09,935 --> 01:31:11,334
Wait.

1745
01:31:54,045 --> 01:31:55,410
Did you shoot that guy?

1746
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:57,172
No. I'm out of bullets.

1747
01:31:57,349 --> 01:31:58,873
Me too.

1748
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:01,314
Maybe it was ricochet.

1749
01:32:01,486 --> 01:32:03,477
Gravity.

1750
01:32:03,655 --> 01:32:05,384
Oh, nice.

1751
01:32:05,557 --> 01:32:07,491
You go down.

1752
01:32:07,659 --> 01:32:08,819
I'll cover.

1753
01:32:08,994 --> 01:32:12,157
Watch my back.
I'll go down and take care of this.

1754
01:32:16,668 --> 01:32:18,499
Sexy motherfucker.

1755
01:32:37,155 --> 01:32:39,555
No, no, there might be
more bad guys up there.

1756
01:32:39,724 --> 01:32:41,988
No, we'll sneak out through
the vent. Come on.

1757
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:45,391
I'll boost you up, okay?
And then you pull me up.

1758
01:32:47,132 --> 01:32:48,929
Oh, nice.

1759
01:32:50,435 --> 01:32:52,027
Here we go. Okay.

1760
01:32:52,203 --> 01:32:55,138
Get up. Yeah. Nice.

1761
01:32:58,043 --> 01:32:59,067
Nice.

1762
01:32:59,711 --> 01:33:01,542
Nice. Okay.

1763
01:33:01,713 --> 01:33:02,975
Pull me up.

1764
01:33:03,148 --> 01:33:04,945
I'm ready. Go.

1765
01:33:05,116 --> 01:33:06,913
- Give it to me.
- Come on.

1766
01:33:07,085 --> 01:33:09,519
- Be taller.
- Be stronger.

1767
01:33:09,688 --> 01:33:11,679
- Pull harder.
- Dale, come on.

1768
01:33:11,856 --> 01:33:14,586
Pull. Pull me. Come on, man.

1769
01:33:14,759 --> 01:33:17,557
- I'm jumping as high as I can.
- Denton!

1770
01:33:20,498 --> 01:33:21,522
Dale!

1771
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:23,224
I'll get help. I'll get help.

1772
01:33:25,036 --> 01:33:28,267
Go ahead and run, you little dipshit.
I'll find you.

1773
01:34:55,927 --> 01:34:57,758
Give me that fire extinguisher.

1774
01:34:57,929 --> 01:34:59,123
Okay.

1775
01:35:20,452 --> 01:35:23,785
You and me, baby.
Drop it now! Put the bag down!

1776
01:35:23,955 --> 01:35:25,115
Now!

1777
01:35:40,038 --> 01:35:41,164
Fuck you!

1778
01:35:46,311 --> 01:35:49,212
Fuck the police!

1779
01:36:09,734 --> 01:36:12,100
Motherfucking kill you!

1780
01:36:14,506 --> 01:36:17,031
- Why you doing this to me?
- Why you doing this to me?

1781
01:36:18,143 --> 01:36:19,633
Oh, shit!

1782
01:36:19,811 --> 01:36:21,005
Come here!

1783
01:36:28,353 --> 01:36:30,287
I hate you!

1784
01:36:30,455 --> 01:36:32,719
No! Ted, stop it!

1785
01:36:39,664 --> 01:36:42,565
Come on, bitch.
Come on, I'll twist your balls so tight.

1786
01:36:42,734 --> 01:36:44,702
You're in the jungle now, baby.

1787
01:36:52,677 --> 01:36:53,735
Jesus!

1788
01:37:01,152 --> 01:37:02,676
Fuck.

1789
01:37:11,930 --> 01:37:13,488
Gonna die.

1790
01:37:16,134 --> 01:37:18,500
- You killed...
- I didn't wanna do that.

1791
01:37:19,571 --> 01:37:21,505
But you weren't gonna stop.

1792
01:37:28,046 --> 01:37:29,604
Shoot him!

1793
01:37:29,781 --> 01:37:32,113
Just take it easy, buddy.

1794
01:37:33,885 --> 01:37:36,251
Shoot him, you dumb fuck!

1795
01:37:39,390 --> 01:37:41,153
I'm hungry.

1796
01:37:41,326 --> 01:37:43,260
I'm going home.

1797
01:37:47,165 --> 01:37:48,826
All right.

1798
01:37:50,435 --> 01:37:52,096
Help.

1799
01:37:54,873 --> 01:37:56,602
I knew you were going soft.

1800
01:37:56,774 --> 01:37:59,868
Dinner's gonna be cold tonight,
asshole.

1801
01:38:00,044 --> 01:38:02,103
Fucked up, man.

1802
01:38:04,315 --> 01:38:07,876
- Well, lookie here. Mr. Folgers.
- Oh, man.

1803
01:38:08,052 --> 01:38:09,485
What's up, sir?

1804
01:38:10,121 --> 01:38:13,921
- Look, I didn't wanna hit you, man...
- Shut the fuck up.

1805
01:38:14,092 --> 01:38:18,586
You think you was gonna
get me, motherfucker, huh?

1806
01:38:18,763 --> 01:38:21,357
You need to sit
your little sexy ass down...

1807
01:38:21,532 --> 01:38:23,659
...and watch yourself get killed now.

1808
01:38:23,835 --> 01:38:25,268
All right.

1809
01:38:25,436 --> 01:38:27,495
You know what?
This is how it's gonna be?

1810
01:38:27,672 --> 01:38:31,267
All right. This is how it ends.

1811
01:38:47,425 --> 01:38:51,521
You just got killed by a
Daewoo Lanos, motherfucker.

1812
01:38:51,696 --> 01:38:53,186
How you like me now, huh?

1813
01:38:54,532 --> 01:38:55,692
Gross.

1814
01:38:55,867 --> 01:38:56,891
Red?

1815
01:38:57,335 --> 01:38:58,495
Saul.

1816
01:38:58,670 --> 01:39:01,571
Hey, Saul. I came back for you, bro.

1817
01:39:01,739 --> 01:39:03,400
- Yeah.
- I remembered, man.

1818
01:39:04,242 --> 01:39:05,732
Bro's before ho's.

1819
01:39:06,444 --> 01:39:09,413
- You lied to me.
- I did. I lied bigtime to you.

1820
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:14,017
Dale said that you didn't even
have herpes and I said that you did.

1821
01:39:14,185 --> 01:39:17,780
Honestly, like, from now on, from
everything that we've gone through...

1822
01:39:17,956 --> 01:39:21,756
...and, like, from seeing this asshole's
nuts smashed with my Daewoo...

1823
01:39:21,926 --> 01:39:24,918
...I wanna be a better friend to you,
like I really am.

1824
01:39:25,697 --> 01:39:28,564
I fucking love you, dog.
Fucking love you.

1825
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:31,293
I wanna be inside you, homes.

1826
01:39:32,537 --> 01:39:34,300
No more lies, Red.

1827
01:39:34,472 --> 01:39:36,997
- This is my moment.
- This is your moment.

1828
01:39:39,610 --> 01:39:41,100
Red!

1829
01:39:58,763 --> 01:40:01,698
You know what? I'm feeling it.

1830
01:40:01,866 --> 01:40:03,731
Red, I'm coming, baby.

1831
01:40:03,901 --> 01:40:06,335
Your stupidity amazes me.

1832
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:10,503
Hey, Ted!

1833
01:40:10,675 --> 01:40:12,643
You killed my brother...

1834
01:40:12,810 --> 01:40:15,904
...Caucasian son of cocksucker!

1835
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:19,106
Suck my balls! Two times!

1836
01:40:26,958 --> 01:40:28,050
Bitch!

1837
01:40:28,226 --> 01:40:29,750
Bring it on.

1838
01:40:41,372 --> 01:40:42,396
Shit. Dale.

1839
01:40:43,941 --> 01:40:46,136
Dale!

1840
01:40:46,310 --> 01:40:47,971
Holy shit!

1841
01:41:24,482 --> 01:41:25,506
Sorry, Ted.

1842
01:41:29,687 --> 01:41:31,655
You've been served.

1843
01:41:38,796 --> 01:41:41,560
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1844
01:41:41,732 --> 01:41:44,257
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1845
01:41:48,539 --> 01:41:50,166
Saul! Saul!

1846
01:41:55,746 --> 01:41:58,681
Wake up, man! This place
is gonna collapse! Come on!

1847
01:41:58,850 --> 01:42:00,681
Come to me!

1848
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:04,585
You're not dying today, friend.

1849
01:42:04,755 --> 01:42:07,622
Not on my watch.

1850
01:42:34,619 --> 01:42:37,816
Saul. Wake up, man, please.

1851
01:42:37,989 --> 01:42:39,422
Saul.

1852
01:42:39,590 --> 01:42:41,080
Wake up.

1853
01:42:41,259 --> 01:42:43,693
Oh, sweet Saul.

1854
01:42:46,197 --> 01:42:48,893
Saul.

1855
01:42:51,736 --> 01:42:53,533
Yes. Yeah.

1856
01:42:53,704 --> 01:42:55,171
Saul, you made it.

1857
01:42:55,339 --> 01:42:57,864
- What?
- Yeah.

1858
01:42:58,042 --> 01:42:59,976
Where am I?

1859
01:43:00,144 --> 01:43:02,169
You made it, man.

1860
01:43:02,346 --> 01:43:04,871
- You saved me.
- You came back for me.

1861
01:43:05,049 --> 01:43:08,075
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank you.

1862
01:43:08,252 --> 01:43:09,583
What happened?

1863
01:43:09,754 --> 01:43:10,982
What happened?

1864
01:43:17,495 --> 01:43:19,895
Holy shit.

1865
01:43:23,801 --> 01:43:25,530
What's that?

1866
01:43:28,306 --> 01:43:30,171
Hi.

1867
01:43:30,341 --> 01:43:32,206
- Red?
- Red?

1868
01:43:35,046 --> 01:43:37,810
- Red.
- Hey.

1869
01:43:37,982 --> 01:43:41,315
Red. Where'd you come from, man?
Where'd he come from?

1870
01:43:41,485 --> 01:43:42,577
He came back to save us.

1871
01:43:42,753 --> 01:43:43,811
- He saved us?
- Yeah.

1872
01:43:43,988 --> 01:43:45,421
All right, man.

1873
01:43:45,590 --> 01:43:47,717
- We all saved each other.
- Yeah.

1874
01:43:47,892 --> 01:43:50,759
Oh, man. We made it, guys.

1875
01:43:50,928 --> 01:43:54,557
We made it. Oh, we made it.

1876
01:44:00,004 --> 01:44:04,964
<i>Hello, you're listening to PPRPBP.</i>
<i>I am Dale Denton.</i>

1877
01:44:05,142 --> 01:44:08,976
<i>The topic of the day: new beginnings.</i>
<i>Getting over losses.</i>

1878
01:44:09,146 --> 01:44:11,546
<i>Friends. Life.</i>

1879
01:44:11,716 --> 01:44:14,310
We have our first caller.

1880
01:44:14,485 --> 01:44:17,113
Yes, ring-ring-ring. How's it going?

1881
01:44:17,288 --> 01:44:18,915
Hi. Am I on the air?

1882
01:44:19,090 --> 01:44:22,116
You are. You're about
to get D'd by the Dale.

1883
01:44:22,293 --> 01:44:23,351
A D in the face.

1884
01:44:23,527 --> 01:44:24,892
- Dale Denton?
- Yeah?

1885
01:44:25,062 --> 01:44:26,996
You're my hero.

1886
01:44:27,164 --> 01:44:29,689
You're my hero.

1887
01:44:30,401 --> 01:44:31,891
You are good, man. Seriously.

1888
01:44:32,069 --> 01:44:33,969
- Thanks.
- Gotta admit, you're pretty good.

1889
01:44:34,138 --> 01:44:36,129
- It sounds pretty good.
- It sounds real.

1890
01:44:36,307 --> 01:44:39,105
- It's not bad, huh?
- If I close my eyes, it sounds like...

1891
01:44:39,277 --> 01:44:42,371
- You are on the radio.
- That's the radio. That's a DJ.

1892
01:44:42,546 --> 01:44:45,413
- If you were on it, I would listen to it.
- Thanks, man.

1893
01:44:45,583 --> 01:44:47,949
It's like when my <i>bubbe</i>
was always playing opera...

1894
01:44:48,119 --> 01:44:49,950
...I hated it, but my <i>bubbe</i> loves it.

1895
01:44:50,121 --> 01:44:52,919
Then it grows on you.
It grows on you. Yeah.

1896
01:44:53,090 --> 01:44:55,684
It's like Red. I didn't like Red
when I first met him.

1897
01:44:55,860 --> 01:44:57,953
- You didn't like me?
- You liked him so much...

1898
01:44:58,129 --> 01:44:59,892
...I like you now.

1899
01:45:00,064 --> 01:45:03,522
I know this sounds weird, but can
we be best friends? Just us, for real?

1900
01:45:03,701 --> 01:45:05,726
- We should all be best friends.
- We should.

1901
01:45:05,903 --> 01:45:09,134
Seriously. You guys are, like,
both of my best friends.

1902
01:45:09,307 --> 01:45:12,105
You didn't know it. Now you know it,
we'll all be best friends.

1903
01:45:12,276 --> 01:45:14,471
Know those hearts that break up,
"best friends"?

1904
01:45:14,645 --> 01:45:16,044
We should get a three-way one.

1905
01:45:16,213 --> 01:45:19,842
- I don't know if they make those.
- We should make the first one.

1906
01:45:20,017 --> 01:45:22,952
I want the middle piece,
so it'll be crooked on both sides.

1907
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:27,022
I know we've gone over this, but, like,
1000 pardons, 1000 pardons, please.

1908
01:45:27,191 --> 01:45:29,921
- I fucked up...
- I was a dick to you, man. I'm sorry.

1909
01:45:30,094 --> 01:45:32,619
I know I was an asshole.
I hope I redeemed myself.

1910
01:45:32,797 --> 01:45:35,664
- I know me and you had our deal.
- We've had some times.

1911
01:45:35,833 --> 01:45:38,700
I feel like something's happening here.
Is that a boner?

1912
01:45:38,869 --> 01:45:41,599
Is that a condo? That us moving
into an apartment together?

1913
01:45:41,772 --> 01:45:43,330
Is that us getting a time-share?

1914
01:45:43,507 --> 01:45:45,907
- You threw an ashtray at his face.
- You hit me, man.

1915
01:45:46,077 --> 01:45:48,443
At the time, I was like:
But it was kind of funny.

1916
01:45:48,612 --> 01:45:51,172
You hit me with a DustBuster, man.

1917
01:45:51,349 --> 01:45:54,443
I didn't wanna hurt you.
It was like, "You better not leave here."

1918
01:45:54,618 --> 01:45:56,609
- That was such a good fight, man.
- That was.

1919
01:45:56,787 --> 01:45:58,254
You fuckhead.

1920
01:45:58,422 --> 01:46:00,982
- The car chase was awesome.
- You got into a car chase?

1921
01:46:01,158 --> 01:46:03,752
- Are you kidding me? Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it was...

1922
01:46:03,928 --> 01:46:06,863
I, like, had my foot
through the window.

1923
01:46:07,031 --> 01:46:11,058
My groin... I mean,
I felt like a wishbone.

1924
01:46:11,235 --> 01:46:13,169
I'm trying to decide
how stoned I am...

1925
01:46:13,337 --> 01:46:15,532
...and just how on the verge
of death am I now.

1926
01:46:15,706 --> 01:46:19,437
Am I seeing shit because I'm stoned
or because I have no blood left?

1927
01:46:19,610 --> 01:46:22,477
- You've been shot, like, seven times.
- You gotta eat.

1928
01:46:22,646 --> 01:46:24,409
- You're losing stuff.
- Here.

1929
01:46:24,582 --> 01:46:26,447
- Here.
- Yeah, okay.

1930
01:46:26,617 --> 01:46:30,075
- Here comes the airplane.
- Look, like a baby.

1931
01:46:32,289 --> 01:46:34,757
It's a miracle.
I think we should all take a moment...

1932
01:46:34,925 --> 01:46:37,485
...and think about what a miracle
it is that we got out.

1933
01:46:37,661 --> 01:46:39,652
And that we became friends
in the process...

1934
01:46:39,830 --> 01:46:42,060
...and learned some shit about life
and stuff.

1935
01:46:42,233 --> 01:46:46,465
Should we touch each other's hands
while we do it? Okay.

1936
01:46:48,506 --> 01:46:49,939
I love you guys.

1937
01:46:50,107 --> 01:46:52,473
I love you dudes so much.

1938
01:46:55,379 --> 01:46:58,075
I'll remember that
for the rest of my life.

1939
01:46:58,949 --> 01:47:00,382
- Red?
- Red?

1940
01:47:00,551 --> 01:47:02,542
Yo, Red, man. You alive?

1941
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:04,085
What's up, pal?

1942
01:47:04,989 --> 01:47:06,479
- Hey.
- Hey.

1943
01:47:06,657 --> 01:47:10,354
I'm like the nerd at the sleepover
who fell asleep at 9.

1944
01:47:10,528 --> 01:47:12,792
That's okay. We won't put
our dicks in your mouth.

1945
01:47:12,963 --> 01:47:16,421
- Oh, God.
- Hey, there's <i>bubbe.</i>

1946
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:18,693
Come on. Let's get out of here.

1947
01:47:18,869 --> 01:47:20,803
Yeah, maybe
we should go to the doctor.

1948
01:47:20,971 --> 01:47:23,064
Do you think she'll drive me
to the hospital?

1949
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:25,174
Me too. I should
get the ear looked at.

1950
01:47:25,342 --> 01:47:27,606
My ear should probably
get professional attention.

1951
01:47:27,778 --> 01:47:29,837
- It is bad.
- That's a bullet burp.

1952
01:47:30,014 --> 01:47:33,040
Either I'm getting ready to die
or I'm gonna take a massive shit.

1953
01:47:33,217 --> 01:47:35,082
If somebody could get me
to the hospital.

1954
01:47:35,252 --> 01:47:36,844
Blood from my ear just...

1955
01:47:37,021 --> 01:47:39,819
You guys smell like shit.

1956
01:47:41,025 --> 01:47:43,687
You are in serious danger.

1957
01:49:43,688 --> 01:49:44,688
