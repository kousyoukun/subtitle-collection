1
00:01:13,965 --> 00:01:17,593
- When did it start?
- At 0500. We're seven minutes in.

2
00:01:26,436 --> 00:01:27,436
Private Miller...

3
00:01:27,604 --> 00:01:30,647
...you've been smoking ltem 9
for seven minutes and 13 seconds.

4
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:32,774
We're going to ask you
several questions.

5
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:33,942
How do you feel?

6
00:01:34,944 --> 00:01:36,361
Well' sir...

7
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,280
...I feel like a...

8
00:01:39,157 --> 00:01:41,491
Like a slice of butter...

9
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:48,081
...melting on top
of a big old pile of flapjacks.

10
00:01:50,668 --> 00:01:51,710
Yeah.

11
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:55,255
Okay, Private Miller,
when you think of your superiors...

12
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,300
...what emotions do you feel?

13
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,975
Okay, Private Miller?

14
00:02:10,605 --> 00:02:11,647
Is this normal?

15
00:02:11,814 --> 00:02:13,482
Okay, Private...

16
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:16,401
Okay, Private Miller?

17
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,153
Private Miller.

18
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:23,200
Answer the question.

19
00:02:29,374 --> 00:02:30,499
This went out' sir.

20
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:33,335
Can you torch me?

21
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:35,128
We'll send someone in.

22
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:38,465
Holy bejesus!

23
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:47,015
Private Miller' answer the question.

24
00:02:47,183 --> 00:02:48,725
What was the question again' sir?

25
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:53,355
When you think of your superiors,
what emotions do you feel?

26
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,274
You know what problem I have...

27
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:58,777
...with your fucking little
dog-and-pony act you call the military?

28
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:02,322
Here it is. One: Lots of dudes.

29
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,907
Where are the boobies?

30
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:07,536
Two: Why are We
underground right now, sir?

31
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:10,872
Why can't we be out in the open?
Why aren't we in a square right now?

32
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,376
Why aren't we talking to people'
letting them know Item 9 exists?

33
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:17,087
Get it out. Shout off the rooftops:

34
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:21,758
"This is great!
This is the bee's knees' Item 9!"

35
00:03:21,926 --> 00:03:23,593
Private, we need you to be serious.

36
00:03:23,761 --> 00:03:27,514
I'm serious. Your dick' my mouth.

37
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:33,353
That's inappropriate.

38
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:42,654
Fuck you!

39
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:46,491
I've seen enough. Shut it down.

40
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:50,245
Bury the hatch. Sell the land.
And dispose of him.

41
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:51,747
This never happened.

42
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:53,540
Dude, what happened to your eye?

43
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,751
Hello.

44
00:03:56,794 --> 00:03:58,086
Can you guys understand me?

45
00:03:58,254 --> 00:04:01,131
- Hey. Hey' where we going?
- This is General Brat.

46
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:04,092
We've reached
a final conclusion on Item 9.

47
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:06,345
Illegal!

48
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:07,971
Hey, this is Sam. Good morning.

49
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:09,306
Welcome to KRAD.

50
00:04:09,474 --> 00:04:12,434
You know, I think that last caller
had some undeniable points.

51
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:15,270
Right now, we're gonna get
to the next caller, Dale Denton.

52
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:17,356
Hey, Sam. Big huge fan.
First-time caller.

53
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:20,859
- Here's my piece.
- All right.

54
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,779
If marijuana is not legal
within the next five years...

55
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:27,032
...I have no faith
left in humanity, period.

56
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,034
Everyone likes smoking weed.

57
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,621
They have for thousands of years.
They're not gonna stop anytime soon.

58
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:34,956
It makes everything better. Makes
food better. Makes music better.

59
00:04:35,124 --> 00:04:37,459
It makes sex feel better,
for God's sakes.

60
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:40,462
It makes shitty movies better,
you know?

61
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,765
Hi, there. Are you Sandra Danby?

62
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:52,974
Yeah.

63
00:04:53,142 --> 00:04:57,771
Well' I'm Garth
from Global Saviors, and...

64
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:59,189
- What is this?
- I'm joking.

65
00:04:59,357 --> 00:05:01,566
You failed to show up
for divorce proceedings...

66
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,529
...four times under court order,
and you've been served.

67
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:08,198
- Oh' great. Thanks a lot' asshole.
- Sorry.

68
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:10,951
I'm just saying love has no age.

69
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:14,329
You can't instantly tell me that a man,
because he's a certain age...

70
00:05:14,497 --> 00:05:16,456
...can't marry a woman
or love a woman.

71
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:17,999
I'm dating a high-school girl.

72
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:21,920
You're not maximizing your potential.
Think this girl takes you seriously?

73
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,465
No, but if I'm 25
and the girl is 18 years old...

74
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:27,676
...you know, in society,
that might look bad.

75
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:30,971
- Hey, as long as it's consensual.
- I think it's consensual.

76
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:34,099
Yo, you been served.

77
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,686
You've been served.
You've been served.

78
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:39,938
You've been served.

79
00:05:47,238 --> 00:05:49,030
Walter Wadska the third.

80
00:05:49,198 --> 00:05:51,533
You here to fix the fax machine?

81
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:54,953
No, I'm here to tell you
you owe MasterCard 4068 bucks.

82
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,497
You've been served by the best.
Keep it real.

83
00:06:03,504 --> 00:06:06,548
Why don't you get a real job,
you fucking cocksucker?

84
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:15,932
- Hey' "Electric Avenue."
- I know, right?

85
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,312
- Take that shit to the next level' eh?
- Okay, I will.

86
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:34,367
- Dr. Edgar Terrence?
- Yes.

87
00:06:34,535 --> 00:06:37,037
You have repeatedly refused
to trim the monkey tree...

88
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:39,247
...that spills
onto your neighbor's property.

89
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:42,000
And noW because of that'
you've been served.

90
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,251
You're a jerk.

91
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:45,420
All this current system is doing...

92
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:47,839
...is putting money
in the hands of criminals...

93
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:51,718
...and it's making ordinary people like
you and me deal with those criminals.

94
00:06:51,886 --> 00:06:55,347
You ever dealt with a drug dealer?
It's terrible' it's weird, it's awkward.

95
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,516
They think they're your friend'
but they're not.

96
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:01,645
Dale, I get your point. Thanks
for your input. Next caller, please.

97
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:16,076
I can't come.

98
00:07:16,953 --> 00:07:18,453
What?

99
00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:20,622
Why the fuck not' Dale?

100
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,123
I just... Look, I can't come.

101
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,043
I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow.
It's a bad day for me.

102
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,380
Jesus Christ' Dale.
When Were you gonna tell me?

103
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,090
My mom has been shopping all day.

104
00:07:30,258 --> 00:07:32,133
- Why?
- She's already planning on couscous.

105
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:35,303
I said I might be able to go,
so why is she doing that already?

106
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:37,472
- How I look like an asshole.
- You are one.

107
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,350
Come on, don't say that.
I just can't go. I have a job.

108
00:07:40,518 --> 00:07:41,977
- Fine.
- "Fine"?

109
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:43,603
Don't come. I don't care.

110
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:47,065
Then Why have you been inviting me?
I thought you wanted me to go.

111
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,484
If you don't wanna meet them'
I don't want you to.

112
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:53,280
I want to. I can't. I have a job.
I'm sorry. What do you want from me?

113
00:07:53,447 --> 00:07:55,949
I just know they'll like you' that's all.

114
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:58,285
You're great' and you're funny...

115
00:07:58,452 --> 00:08:00,328
...and you're sexy.

116
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,956
I just want them to see that.

117
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:05,792
- You Want them to see that I'm sexy?
- Hey' people?

118
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,502
- Hi, Mr. Edwards.
- Can I help you?

119
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,671
No, I'm good. Thank you, though.

120
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,841
Yeah? I see you don't have
a visitor's badge. That's why I ask.

121
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:16,011
- I'm with her' actually.
- Actually, this is my boyfriend.

122
00:08:17,221 --> 00:08:20,473
I heard that. I wish I didn't hear that,
but I just heard that.

123
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:21,975
What's that supposed to mean?

124
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:25,770
I'm just wondering Why you don't
date a nice guy your own age.

125
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,897
- She's very mature for her age.
- Yeah.

126
00:08:28,065 --> 00:08:29,649
- Angie' hey. How's it going?
- Hey.

127
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:31,860
Hey, Clark, how you doing' man?
What's up?

128
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:34,821
I'm good, bro. I'm good.

129
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:36,615
Dude, I wanted to tell you.

130
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,658
You were hilarious today
in drama class.

131
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:41,369
Your Jeff Goldblum impression
made me pee my pants.

132
00:08:41,996 --> 00:08:43,038
I wish.

133
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,790
Oh' hey' I almost forgot.

134
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,501
Last week when we worked out,
you forgot your shorts in my car.

135
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:50,045
Oh' yeah.

136
00:08:50,212 --> 00:08:51,630

137

Yeah, no problem, no problem.

00:08:53,382 --> 00:08:54,841
- Can you hold those?
- Yeah.

139
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:57,052
- Yeah.

140
00:08:57,219 --> 00:08:58,511

147
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:17,405

of Angela' man.

156
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,929
He's great. He's a wonderful
lab partner. He'll keep an eye on her.

157
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:43,348
Why don't you go fuck yourself,
you weird prick?

158
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,600
I'm a teacher.
You can't talk to me like that.

159
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:48,061
I'm not a student'
so I can say whatever I Want...

160
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:50,480
...you chimp-fucking little bastard.
- Actually...

161
00:09:50,648 --> 00:09:53,441
You've got T-minus 30 seconds
to get off school property...

162
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:55,276
...or I call the liaison officer.

163
00:09:55,444 --> 00:09:58,613
- We're leaving. I'm sorry.
- Middle finger won't stop the clock.

164
00:09:58,781 --> 00:09:59,781
What a jerk.

165
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:01,700
What's that guy's problem? Jesus.

166
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,911
I don't... Normally he's...
That's really weird.

167
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:08,081
I'd love to have dinner with you
and your parents tomorrow night.

168
00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:11,126
I'm gonna go. I'll definitely go.
I'll shuffle things around...

169
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:13,169
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll be there for sure.

170
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:15,714
Yeah, I Wanna show them
you're in good hands. Yeah.

171
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,632
I got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

172
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,634
That means so much to me
and my parents.

173
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:22,804
No problem.
It's gonna be awesome.

174
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:26,975
- Hello?
- Hey' Saul. Mind if I come by?

175
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,170
- Come on down.
- Sweet. Be there.

176
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,005
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi.

177
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,800
I thought the hurricane season
was over.

178
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,635
I thought hurricane season
was over.

179
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,595
I'm sorry.
Things just got out of hand.

180
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,139
Yeah, that's the way it was
with my first husband.

181
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,019
Hello? Hey' man.

182
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,938
What the fuck' man?

183
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,732
I didn't buzz you in.
How the monkey did you get in here?

184
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,069
Some guy with a fauxhawk let me in.
He was leaving when I...

185
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,363
- Fucking Kyle.
- It might have been Kyle.

186
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,156
- Asshole.
- I'm sorry, man.

187
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,367
What the fuck's
the buzzer for anyway?

188
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:04,037
I don't knoW. I'm sorry about that.
I don't knoW your protocol yet.

189
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,456
Stuff your sorries in a sack.
It's not your fault.

190
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,584
- Okay.
- It's these jerk-offs. Have a seat.

191
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,753
Okay, cool.
Thanks, man. Awesome.

192
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,130
Yo, check this out.

193
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,219
Satellite radio.

194
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,347
Got two TVs and radio.
That's pretty rad.

195
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,807
That's home entertainment.

196
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:27,185
You're very entertained.
Oh' wow. You got a cute picture too.

197
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,479
Oh' yeah. Me and my bubbe.

198
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,565
Hey, let me ask you something.

199
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,066
Yeah?

200
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:37,445
Do you think you could pull the plug
on someone if you needed to?

201
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,698
Like, euthanasia?

202
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,869
Like, on her?

203
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,871
If I needed to.

204
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,835
I'm kind of in a hurry, man.

205
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,671
I don't knoW if we should
start going down that road.

206
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,799
I could talk all day about euthanasia.
Don't get me started.

207
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,509
- Maybe we should...
- We'll save it.

208
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,012
- Save it for next time.
- I'll take that rain check.

209
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,597
Business for the businessman.

210
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,891
- Yeah, you got my number.
- Okay.

211
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,475
- Brass tacks.
- Yes.

212
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:11,062
Just got a shipment
of the dopest dope I've ever smoked.

213
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,106
Hands down'
dopest dope I've ever smoked.

214
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,359
Not better than the Blue Oyster.
It can't be. I can't handle that.

215
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:21,197
This is like if that Blue Oyster shit
met that Afghan Kush I had...

216
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,824
...and they had a baby.

217
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,827
And meanwhile, that crazy
Northern Lights stuff I had...

218
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,664
...and the Super Red Especial
Snowflake met and had a baby.

219
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:33,293
And by some miracle,
those two babies met and fucked...

220
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,671
...this would be the shit
that they birthed.

221
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,174
- Yes.
- This is the product of baby fucking.

222
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,634
- Smell it.
- Okay.

223
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,136
Smell it. Enjoy.

224
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,473
It's like God's vagina.

225
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,476
What, you wanna bathe in it?

226
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,519
- I wanna live in here.
- You Wanna be it?

227
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,814
My God' I just wanna shove it
up my nose' have that smell all day.

228
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,067
- That's amazing.
- Shove it anywhere you like.

229
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,526
Beautiful. What's it called?

230
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,820
- Pineapple Express.
- Pineapple Express.

231
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,989
It's this thing, like' El Nino.

232
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,159
This airflow that comes
from Hawaii and Canada.

233
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,204
It gets the dirt, mixes it in
with the weed in a special way.

234
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,706
It's very scientific.
I won't go into it right now.

235
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,542
But I am the only guy
in the whole city that has it.

236
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,294
Only 10 bones more for a quarter.

237
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,171
Okay, I'll take a quarter.

238
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,340
- All right, you're on.
- Thank you very much.

239
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,841
Let me get my scale.

240
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,387
Get it going. Grab the scale.
Let's get me out of here.

241
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,349
I thought hurricane season
was over.

242
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,602
Oh' crow.

243
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,732
Where are you' you little fucker?

244
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,362
What the fuck is this thing?

245
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,031
- Cross joint.
- Yeah.

246
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,534
- You ever smoke one of those?
- You can smoke this?

247
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:48,785
- Yeah, man.
- No.

248
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,037
This is the future.

249
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:56,042
This is, like' the apex
of the vortex of joint engineering.

250
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,462
It's rumored that M. M. O'Shaughnessy
designed the first one.

251
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,215
The guy who designed
the Golden Gate Bridge.

252
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,634
My second favorite civil engineer...

253
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:08,680
...behind Hannskarl Bandel,
Madison Square Garden.

254
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,642
What you do is you light all three ends
at the same time.

255
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,062
- Really?
- And then the smoke converges...

256
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,316
...creating a trifecta
of joint-smoking power.

257
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,737
This is it, man. This is what your
grandchildren are gonna be smoking.

258
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,905
Future. The future.

259
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,616
That's amazing.
Well' got the weed?

260
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,703
- Yeah.
- In the bag. Beautiful. Okay.

261
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,790
Be careful with that thing' man.
Here's the cash, grab the stash.

262
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,751
Alrighty' man, thanks.
Have a good one.

263
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,711
Don't hurt yourself. Adios.

264
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,005
Well' hey' wait a minute' man.

265
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,923
Let's smoke this fucking thing.

266
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,925
I really... I can't' man. I gotta...

267
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,219
I can't even light this thing
on my own.

268
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,306
Yeah, I need your help' man.

269
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,767
- I'm in.
- Come on!

270
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,728
- Why not? Let's do it.
- Come on down!

271
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,772
Why not? What do I do?

272
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,106
Okay, here's What you do.

273
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,983
- You equip yourself.
- I'm equipping.

274
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,568
- Equip me' sir.
- Okay.

275
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:08,615
You are going to light these tWo ends
while I light this end.

276
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,533
- Okay.
- Are you ready?

277
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,578
- Ready.
- Blast off.

278
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,305
- I'm gonna do it.
- Good. Go for it.

279
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,819
It's better to cough.

280
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,529
It's like...

281
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,322
Makes you 10 times more higher...

282
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,741
...than the cross Weed
and the Pineapple Express.

283
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:55,703
You're like'
totally fucking Gong Show'ed, man.

284
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,051
Oh' fuck.

285
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,678
Hang on one second, man.

286
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:12,887
Oh' you fucker.

287
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,060
Who is it?

288
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,062
It's Chris Gebert, man. Let me up.

289
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,438
Shit.

290
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,190
What's a Gebert?

291
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,942
Come on up.

292
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,445
He ain't getting any
of that Pineapple Express.

293
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:33,992
Chris is getting Snicklefritz.

294
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,287
Hey.

295
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,455
So listen, man.

296
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,041
I gotta ask you. So...

297
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:46,171
Listen' man. You've been buying
from me for, like, tWo months' right?

298
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,631
- Two months.
- I gotta ask' man.

299
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,341
What's up with the suit?

300
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,303
I'm a process server.
So I have to wear a suit.

301
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,849
Wow, you're a servant?
Like a butler?

302
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,227
- A chauffeur?
- No. No. What? No' I'm not...

303
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,480
- Shine shoes?
- I'm a process server.

304
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,149
- I like...
- In process.

305
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,276
I work for a company
that's, like' hired...

306
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,445
...by laWyers to hand out
legal documents.

307
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,739
Like subpoenas to people
who don't want them.

308
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:16,743
I gotta wear disguises sometimes just to
make them admit they're themselves...

309
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,162
...so I can serve them the papers.

310
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,371
Disguise.

311
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,664
Kind of, I guess.

312
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,875
- It's a hell of a job.
- That's cool, man.

313
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,213
Like a day-to-day basis, it's fine.
Like today' I' like, sat in my car...

314
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,839
...I smoked, like' 10 doobies...

315
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,508
...and then I went to go visit
my girlfriend at lunch.

316
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,302
Nice.

317
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,930
What? You sucked on her titties?

318
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,141
No, I just kissed her.
I just did that to make it seem cool.

319
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,810
That's cool.
Does she like to smoke weed?

320
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,104
A little sometimes.
She has a couple...

321
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,024
She's in high school,
so as much as any high-school kid.

322
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,026
She's cool as hell, actually.

323
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,945
- You'd get along With her.
- Really?

324
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,822
Yeah, you knoW, it only sucks...

325
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,743
...when I go visit her in high school
and the guys she goes to school with...

326
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,329
...are strong and handsome
and really funny.

327
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,374
Like, do good impressions
of Jeff Goldblum and shit like that.

328
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:09,545
And' like, I just feel like a fat, dumb'
fucking stinky ass-turd when I'm there.

329
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,923
- What?
- It really... It sucks for my ego.

330
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,467
- Fuck Jeff Goldblum, man.
- That's what I say.

331
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,303
You know, don't get doWn on yourself.
You got a great girl.

332
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,889
You got a great job
where you don't do anything.

333
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,183
You get to smoke weed all day.

334
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,726
I wish I had that.

335
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:27,230
Are you kidd...? You do.
You have the easiest job on Earth.

336
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:30,483
- You do smoke weed all day.
- That's true.

337
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,111
You didn't think of that.

338
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,321
- I do have a good job.
- Yeah, you do nothing.

339
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,739
- Thanks, man.
- No prob.

340
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,533
Thank you.

341
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,828
Oh' shit. All right. Business.

342
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,831
- Got my persona.
- Yeah, yeah.

343
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,499
Hey. Put that cross joint out.

344
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,085
He sees that' he'll never
get the fuck out of here.

345
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,463
- What's up, Chris?
- Yo, hey, Saul.

346
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,965
- Hey.
- How you doing, buddy?

347
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,425
All right, homes. Good.

348
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,719
- Who's this?
- Hey. Oh, that's my friend Mark.

349
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,846
You got the dough? There you go.

350
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,181
- Appreciate it.
- Nice. Good to meet you' Mark.

351
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,726
- Do you have any Percocet, please?
- Percocet?

352
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,228
What are you talking about?
I don't sell that shit.

353
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,438
- Chris.
- Chris.

354
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,356
You told him I was
gonna sell Percocet?

355
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,026
- I didn't say anything about Percocet.
- What the fuck?

356
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,403
- I just wanted a couple Percocets.
- Well' I...

357
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,488
You came to the wrong place.
Wrong place.

358
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,533
- Sorry.
- Yeah, nice. Peace out, homes.

359
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,951
- Thank...
- God.

360
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,120
- What the fuck?
- Yeah.

361
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,122
- Fucking lingerer.
- Yeah, totally.

362
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,665
- Lingerer.
- Hardcore.

363
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,334
Fuck.

364
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,045
- Bums me out.
- Bums me out too.

365
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,840
If there's one quality
I hate in a person' it's lingering.

366
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,718
- That's right. You and me both.
- Yeah, yeah.

367
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,138
So I'm curious. What have
those people done that you go...

368
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,390
...and process and service?

369
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,060
I don't knoW. It's alWays
something different' I guess.

370
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,519
This guy...

371
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,397
Ted Jones, who knows. You know?

372
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,816
- Ted Jones?
- Yeah, why?

373
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:57,779
My guy' Red, who I buy from'
he gets his stuff from a Ted Jones.

374
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,864
- Really?
- Maybe it's the same guy.

375
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,074
That'd be weird.

376
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,785
It's a pretty normal name,
I guess, but...

377
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:07,497
Anyway, I should really
get going, man. I gotta go.

378
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,999
Duty calls, but it's good to see you.
Thanks.

379
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,794
You're gonna smoke and run?
Come on, man.

380
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,005
We can go look at some crazy things
on the Internet together.

381
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,300
That sounds appealing, but I think
I should probably just get going.

382
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,885
- Oh' that sucks.
- Yeah.

383
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,346
That's cool' man.
What are you doing this weekend?

384
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:26,432
Because, you know, my bubbe's
got season tickets to the opera...

385
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,769
...and she can't make it'
so wanna go see Phantom?

386
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,814
- Of the Opera?
- Yeah.

387
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,442
I can't this weekend'
but you know what? Here.

388
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,321
You know... I'll run out of weed in
a couple days. I'll come by' hang out.

389
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,282
- We'll watch 227 and shit.
- Definitely.

390
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,326
Cool, man. Well' thanks.
Good to see you.

391
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,661
- Peace' brother.
- Okay.

392
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,329
One love.

393
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,667
When you got behind
on the mortgage...

394
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:52,627
...someone finally
made you a loan?

395
00:20:52,795 --> 00:20:53,878
Yes, he did.

396
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:56,673
Yes, he did.
What was the interest rate you gotu

397
00:20:56,841 --> 00:21:01,428
- It was 12 or 13 percent.
- That's disgusting.

398
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:12,939
- Hello?
- Hello.

399
00:21:13,107 --> 00:21:14,733
Hey, Angie' what's happening?

400
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,361
I just talked to my mom, and they are
so excited you're coming for dinner.

401
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:21,698
Like, so excited. And so am I,
but we're all really excited.

402
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:22,866
Thank you so much.

403
00:21:23,034 --> 00:21:25,368
No problem. I'm psyched too.
It's gonna be awesome.

404
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:29,205
Couscous. The food so nice'
they named it twice.

405
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:34,085
Dale, anyway, I can't wait
for next year when this bullshit's over.

406
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:37,172
Oh' shit. I see the guy I gotta serve.
I'll call you back.

407
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,257
Fucking cops. Shit.

408
00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:48,183
Jesus.

409
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:55,398
What an adorable little cop.

410
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,484
Weird.

411
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:03,907
Jesus. Fuck.

412
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:06,076
What the fuck was that?

413
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:07,535
Oh' shit.

414
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:11,373
Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude.

415
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,582
Oh' no!

416
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,722
- Drive, drive.
- Who the fuck is that?

417
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,891
I don't knoW,
but I ain't waiting to see.

418
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:01,798
Pineapple Express.

419
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,927
Oh' my God! Oh, my God!
Oh' my God! Oh, my God!

420
00:23:06,095 --> 00:23:07,595
I saW brains and blood!

421
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:09,222
Come on! Come on!

422
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,473
Where do I go?

423
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:27,907
Hello?

424
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,826
Saul, it's Dale.
Let me in. Let me in.

425
00:23:29,994 --> 00:23:32,454
I just saw some crazy shit.
Please. Let me in.

426
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:35,415
- It's Dale Denton. Let me in, man?
- Dale?

427
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:38,209
Yes, Dale. That's what I said.
It's Dale. Let me in.

428
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:40,462
Oh' all right' man. Come on up.

429
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:46,634
I buzzed it. Open the door
when I buzz it.

430
00:23:46,802 --> 00:23:48,636
Buzz it in three seconds exactly.

431
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:51,264
One, two...

432
00:23:51,432 --> 00:23:53,475
- Did it work?
- On three!

433
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:56,478
I did it on three.
On "one' two' three, go"?

434
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:58,396
Just on three.

435
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:10,992
- He fucking killed him.
- Hey' I got neighbors.

436
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,619
He fucking killed him.

437
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:15,747
- Who killed who?
- A cop. A lady and a guy.

438
00:24:15,915 --> 00:24:19,042
A cop' a lady and a guy?
That's a massacre. You saw it?

439
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,211
No, it was just a guy.

440
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:23,046
- What happened to the lady?
- No. No.

441
00:24:23,214 --> 00:24:27,884
A woman. A policeWoman and a guy'
another guy' shot another guy...

442
00:24:28,052 --> 00:24:31,054
...an Asian guy, in the window,
at fucking Ted's house.

443
00:24:31,222 --> 00:24:32,805
Whoa' was the other guy Ted?

444
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:35,058
I don't knoW.
He was a big' gray-haired man...

445
00:24:35,226 --> 00:24:36,976
...and he had a robe
and he shot him.

446
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:40,063
And his brain flew every...
I'm gonna be... I'm gonna throw up.

447
00:24:40,231 --> 00:24:41,689
What?

448
00:24:42,775 --> 00:24:45,151
- That was chicken fries.
- Sick.

449
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,736
You threw up on my printer.

450
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:48,238
- I did.
- Did you break it?

451
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:50,323
- I hope not.
- Listen' man.

452
00:24:50,491 --> 00:24:51,991
I think the guy was Ted.

453
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,993
And the Asians
are number-two in town...

454
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:56,079
...so you saW Ted
capping the competition.

455
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:58,081
They saw me
seeing them shoot the guy.

456
00:24:58,249 --> 00:24:59,916
What? They saw you?

457
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:01,417
And you fucking came here?

458
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:03,586
- Did they follow you here?
- I don't know.

459
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:08,007
- Did they follow you here?
- I don't know. Look. Look. Okay.

460
00:25:09,552 --> 00:25:10,885
I saW them kill him.

461
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:13,763
I freaked out. I panicked, okay?

462
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:16,099
I tossed my roach.

463
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:18,726
- I crashed into two cars.
- Yeah.

464
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:22,021
So they must have heard...
They knoW someone was out there.

465
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:24,315
- They know someone saw.
- They know "someone."

466
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:27,110
They don't know it was you. Right?

467
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:30,697
I don't... I mean, yeah. I don't know.

468
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:32,448
- Yes.
- I hope not.

469
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:33,658
Relax.

470
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:38,621
Just sit back. Get ready to enjoy some
of the rarest weed knoWn to mankind.

471
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:42,625
Is it really that rare?

472
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:45,128
It's' like, the rarest.

473
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,797
It's almost a shame to smoke it.

474
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:51,926
It's like killing a unicorn...

475
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:53,803
...with, like, a bomb.

476
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:58,266
Are you the only guy in town
who has this?

477
00:25:58,434 --> 00:26:00,560
- You're actually the only guy?
- Yeah.

478
00:26:00,728 --> 00:26:04,314
My guy Red said he was giving me
an exclusive sneak preview.

479
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:07,567
I'm the only guy you sold it to?
The other guys got Snicklefritz?

480
00:26:07,735 --> 00:26:10,820
Yeah. So We're, like' the only guys.

481
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:12,822
And Red got this from Ted?

482
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,324
Ted's the man.

483
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:18,036
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go!

484
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:20,538
I threw a roach of this
outside of Ted's house.

485
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:22,707
So what? I throw roaches
all over toWn.

486
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:26,294
No. He could find the roach
and say' "It's Pineapple Express.

487
00:26:26,462 --> 00:26:28,671
Saul is the only guy
who has Pineapple Express.

488
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,923
He must have seen the murder!
Let's kill him!"

489
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:32,508
- Let's get out of here!
- Fuck!

490
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:35,511
Wait! Stop!
Get weed! Get the weed!

491
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,848
Anything we might need.
Snacks, food' Fruit Roll-Ups.

492
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:41,142
- Let's get the fuck out of here!
- Okay, okay.

493
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:02,372
Red said he'd be here.

494
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:12,340
Them some drugs.

495
00:27:14,465 --> 00:27:16,049
Smells like vomit in this house.

496
00:27:16,216 --> 00:27:18,092
Want a hit, man? It's still lit.

497
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,428
I'm having dinner with my wife.
She can tell.

498
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:22,263
Smell it on my sweater.

499
00:27:22,431 --> 00:27:23,890
For real?

500
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:25,350
Yeah, for real.

501
00:27:25,517 --> 00:27:28,311
You wanna wear my vest?
It smell good.

502
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:29,562
Not my style.

503
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,065
You ain't got no style, motherfucker.

504
00:27:32,232 --> 00:27:34,692
You have reached
the voice mailbox of...

505
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,486
- Ted.
- Ted, it's Budlofsky.

506
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:39,447
- We're here. Saul's gone.
- And Mathe...

507
00:27:40,991 --> 00:27:43,660
- And Matheson.
- I think he knew We Were coming.

508
00:27:43,827 --> 00:27:44,952
They not here, Ted.

509
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,829
Hi, Ted.

510
00:27:47,414 --> 00:27:49,707
Okay, what do you know
about Ted?

511
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:51,751
I think he's crazy about murdering.

512
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,253
Jesus, man.
Well' how much money do you have?

513
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:57,590
- I have, like' the 75 that you gave me.
- That's it?

514
00:27:57,758 --> 00:27:59,634
- Well' hoW much do you have?
- Three bucks.

515
00:27:59,802 --> 00:28:02,387
What you getting on my case for?
I have more than you.

516
00:28:02,554 --> 00:28:06,307
Well' that's my 75 technically.
So I have $78 and you have nothing.

517
00:28:06,475 --> 00:28:10,853
I don't knoW. Let's just go... Go to
a motel or a hotel and just hide out.

518
00:28:11,021 --> 00:28:14,607
The police were in on it. Could have
flagged credit cards. They'll find us.

519
00:28:15,234 --> 00:28:18,778
Shit. I wish We could
just go nowhere.

520
00:28:20,906 --> 00:28:22,073
Okay.

521
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:27,954
Even if he found that roach,
how could he knoW where you are?

522
00:28:29,415 --> 00:28:31,249
Heat-seeking missiles.

523
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,085
Bloodhounds.

524
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:36,671
Foxes.

525
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:38,464
Barracudas.

526
00:28:38,632 --> 00:28:41,843
I'm kind of flabbergasted when
you say things like that. It's Weird.

527
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,052
Thank you.

528
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,263
Not a compliment.
Here's the question.

529
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:47,348
Let's say he actually
found the roach.

530
00:28:47,516 --> 00:28:51,728
How could he connect
the Pineapple Express weed to you?

531
00:28:51,895 --> 00:28:55,231
He can't, man.
Only fucking Red knows.

532
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:57,275
Only Red knows, man.

533
00:28:57,443 --> 00:28:58,860
Who is Red?

534
00:28:59,027 --> 00:29:02,697
Red's' like, the middleman
between' like, Ted and me.

535
00:29:02,865 --> 00:29:04,949
And we're, like'
mad fucking tight, man.

536
00:29:05,117 --> 00:29:07,201
One time, he got this girl...

537
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:10,788
...to give me a hand job, like'
within five minutes of meeting her.

538
00:29:10,956 --> 00:29:15,501
It was like' "I don't
even know your name, whoa."

539
00:29:15,878 --> 00:29:20,840
That is pretty rad, but, like'
let's say Ted calls him and is like:

540
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:23,176
"Did you sell the Pineapple Express
to anyone?"

541
00:29:23,343 --> 00:29:25,970
He'll be, "Yeah, I sold it to Saul."
Why wouldn't he?

542
00:29:26,138 --> 00:29:28,848
No. Oh' no. Fuck that, man.

543
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:32,602
Fucking hand job' Dale.
Imagine if I gave you a hand job.

544
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,606
- Why would I wanna do that?
- No, I mean if I got you a hand job.

545
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:39,233
The same rules don't apply to Red.
He's a drug dealer.

546
00:29:41,236 --> 00:29:45,031
I'm a drug dealer.
Are you saying you don't trust me?

547
00:29:45,824 --> 00:29:48,326
No, that's not at all what I'm...
You know what?

548
00:29:48,494 --> 00:29:52,455
You know? Just ignore What I said.
Call him. Give him a call.

549
00:29:52,623 --> 00:29:54,248
See what the dealio is.

550
00:29:57,961 --> 00:29:59,754
- Hello.
- Hey, Red, you okay?

551
00:29:59,922 --> 00:30:03,049
Yeah, Saul. Yeah' I'm fine' man.
I just stubbed my toe.

552
00:30:03,217 --> 00:30:06,219
Be careful, man. Be careful.
Wear shoes in the house.

553
00:30:06,386 --> 00:30:09,388
Safety. Safety first, then teamwork.
Now' listen.

554
00:30:09,556 --> 00:30:12,058
You know that Pineapple Express stuff
you gave me?

555
00:30:12,226 --> 00:30:14,894
Don't tell anybody
that you sold it to me.

556
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:16,354
I'd never talk to anyone...

557
00:30:16,522 --> 00:30:20,733
...about the stuft that I do with you
involving drugs.

558
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:23,402
All right, cool.
Listen' I'm gonna come by.

559
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,404
I gotta lay some shit on you.

560
00:30:25,572 --> 00:30:27,198
There is a fly in the ointment.

561
00:30:27,366 --> 00:30:29,909
Shit has hit the fan.
The lion will speak.

562
00:30:30,077 --> 00:30:32,411
- I'm in the middle of a convo.
- No, seriously.

563
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:35,081
- We're gonna be there in half an hour.
- Perfect.

564
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:38,251
- No, please. No, no, no.
- Let's go over there and chill out.

565
00:30:38,418 --> 00:30:40,878
No, can we go tomorrow?
Look, we're already here...

566
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:43,464
There's somebody else
on the phone with him.

567
00:30:43,632 --> 00:30:44,674
- Who?
- I don't know.

568
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:46,467
He's whispering to another man.

569
00:30:46,635 --> 00:30:49,470
We'll go in the morning.
It's better that way.

570
00:30:49,638 --> 00:30:53,140
- Okay.
- Yes. Yes. Thank you. Yes.

571
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:55,726
- Hey.
- So you're coming by tomorrow?

572
00:30:55,894 --> 00:30:56,936
How'd you know that?

573
00:30:57,104 --> 00:31:00,982
Heard you whispering to that other guy
that you were talking to. Who is that?

574
00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:03,776
Right, Dale. Good job.
Listen' I can't go in the morning...

575
00:31:03,944 --> 00:31:06,779
...because my bubbe... Gotta change
her clocks. Daylight-savings.

576
00:31:06,947 --> 00:31:09,448
Is that the bubbe
that's on 41 st and River Street?

577
00:31:09,616 --> 00:31:12,034
The one where we played
shuffleboard that one time?

578
00:31:12,202 --> 00:31:14,829
You got it. So, listen'
we'll be chilling by noon.

579
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:18,124
- Noon it is' bromosexual.
- Nice.

580
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:20,960
We should hit up the casino again.
It's been a while.

581
00:31:21,128 --> 00:31:23,796
Okay, yeah.
We'll definitely hit the casino up.

582
00:31:23,964 --> 00:31:27,258
Definitely. All right' peace, brother.

583
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,302
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

584
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:31,345
- Why'd he mention a casino?
- I don't know.

585
00:31:31,513 --> 00:31:34,307
You make me call my good
friend' send him into a booby trap.

586
00:31:34,474 --> 00:31:36,142
- And lie to him.
- Is Saul Asian?

587
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,311
- Making me a shitty person.
- Is he Asian?

588
00:31:38,478 --> 00:31:39,854
- He's not Asian.
- You're lying.

589
00:31:40,022 --> 00:31:42,565
- I'm not lying. I'm not lying.
- You're lying.

590
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:44,275
Did you hear slot machines?

591
00:31:44,443 --> 00:31:47,069
- Man' I don't know where he is.
- You tell me Where he is.

592
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:50,114
Tell me. In 45 minutes,
I gotta go have dinner with my wife.

593
00:31:50,282 --> 00:31:51,866
- I got a reservation.
- Forty-five?

594
00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:54,201
That's a dinner reservation
you gonna miss.

595
00:31:54,369 --> 00:31:55,828
That's a reservation I'll make.

596
00:31:55,996 --> 00:31:58,414
- I don't think so.
- Because if he doesn't start to...

597
00:31:58,582 --> 00:32:02,668
- Look, can you do this one solo?
- No, I can't do this solo. Are you crazy?

598
00:32:02,836 --> 00:32:06,464
- What are you talking about? What?
- What, you trying to abandon me?

599
00:32:06,632 --> 00:32:09,717
This is teamwork. This is a
partnership. We are in this together.

600
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:11,510
- You want me to stay?
- Yes.

601
00:32:11,678 --> 00:32:13,012
- Fine, I'll stay.
- Thank you.

602
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,181
- You happy now?
- Yes.

603
00:32:15,349 --> 00:32:17,642
There's no way that
we could pause for a minute...

604
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:19,143
...you guys go home...

605
00:32:19,311 --> 00:32:22,438
...and then tomorrow we
could just' like, continue?

606
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:29,364
I should call Angie soon.

607
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:32,575
Make up some bullshit.

608
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:33,826
I'm cold.

609
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:37,080
You're cold?
Oh' I'm not cold at all. Here.

610
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,247
I run hot.

611
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:39,749
- Really?
- Yeah.

612
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:43,211
- You got more body mass.
- Thick blood. Yeah, no, take it.

613
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:46,589
- Thank you.
- I don't appreciate that' but it's okay.

614
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:49,008
I'm gonna call Angie.

615
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,266
Space.

616
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,853
Dale, wait. Wait.

617
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,607
The phones. The phones.

618
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:07,068
- You said they Were cops, right?
- They are, yeah.

619
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:08,778
I was thinking' maybe they can...

620
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:11,697
...triangulate these things' man'
or, like' trace them.

621
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,783
- Right?
- That's how they got Saddam.

622
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,785
- Right.
- Fuck. You're right' man.

623
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:17,620
Maybe they can even trace them...

624
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:20,248
...like' when We're not even
on them' you know?

625
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:23,918
Maybe if we bury them, the reception
will cut off and they won't be able to.

626
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,045
We can tie it to an animal,
be a diversion.

627
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,672
We'll never catch an animal.

628
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,299
The squirrel'd be up in a tree'
they'd think we were.

629
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:32,093
No, no, no.

630
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:34,637
- We'll build a hot-air balloon and...
- No.

631
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,180
- We'll smash them.
- Yeah, yeah.

632
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,765
I'm gonna smash it. On a rock.

633
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,852
- Right here. Good thinking.
- Good idea. Yes, destroy it.

634
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,229
- Get it.
- Die. Yes.

635
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:48,067
- What the fuck was that?
- I was trying to hit that tree. I missed.

636
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,445
- What tree?
- That one.

637
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:53,156
Why didn't you smash it
on a rock like a normal person?

638
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:56,159
I don't know. How often does
somebody smash things? I'm rusty.

639
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,286
Did you at least see
where it landed?

640
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:00,079
I don't knoW. Call it.

641
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:03,958
Call it? With What?
My phone has been smashed.

642
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,753
I bet they can't even triangulate
those things.

643
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:11,382
Well' you convinced me they can.
You were very convincing back there.

644
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,177
Hey. Fine. I'll go find it. Fuck.

645
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:16,471
- Do you see it?
- See What?

646
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,890
The phone, you idiot.

647
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,851
Why are we here?
This place is so fucking scary.

648
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:24,312
At least I had an idea.
You didn't, so shut up.

649
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,231
That's not true. I had two ideas.
Nowhere and Quiznos.

650
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,400
- What?
- What was that?

651
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,651
- What?
- What is that?

652
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:33,696
- What?
- I hear something.

653
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:34,906
What?

654
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,949
I don't knoW. Do you hear that?

655
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:39,494
Dude, I literally hear nothing.

656
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,412
Oh' fuck!

657
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,957
Where are you going? What are
you running from? Return to me now!

658
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:48,544
Help me!

659
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,047
Tell him to get aWay from me!

660
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:53,382
I'm scared of this darkness!
I surrender!

661
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,384
- Go away! Go away!
- I'm unarmed!

662
00:34:57,221 --> 00:34:59,222
- This isn't funny anymore!
- Dale!

663
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,140
- Fall back!
- Save me!

664
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:15,321
Oh' shit.

665
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:18,366
Car.

666
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,709
Open it! Open it!
Open the door! Open it!

667
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,128
- Unlock it.
- I can't unlock it.

668
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,589
What are you doing?
Watch the upholstery.

669
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:37,426
- Go! I saw something!
- Go! What did you see? Shut up!

670
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:41,097
Shut the fuck... Shut up, man!

671
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:43,558
I heard something,
then I saw something.

672
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,434
You didn't hear anything' man.

673
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:47,436
Well' I saw something.

674
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:54,610
And you're telling me that guy
in the little short shorts...

675
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,153
...broke your nose?
- Right.

676
00:35:56,321 --> 00:36:00,241
The BeDazzler guy
broke your nose, tough man?

677
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,258
Wake up. Get up. Wake up.

678
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,219
How did I get on you?

679
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,638
I wonder.

680
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,519
Watch finally broke.

681
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,313
Crazy. What time is it?

682
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:35,443
That can't be right.

683
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,779
It couldn't be 3 in the morning,
could it?

684
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,032
It's 3:00 right now?

685
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,742
Holy shit, man!

686
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:46,412
We were supposed to be at Red's
at noon, man. What if he's gone?

687
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,039
No, it's daylight-savings' so...

688
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,208
- So it's only 2:00.
- Oh' no' it went forWard an hour.

689
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:55,671
It's 4 o'-fucking-clock?
Fuck me. No' man. That's bad.

690
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:59,008
Shit. We slept for' like, 18 hours.

691
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:01,719
My bubbe...
Man' my bubbe's gonna be so pissed.

692
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:02,970
Shit.

693
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,972
We gotta call Red.

694
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,725
Okay. Now?

695
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,935
We'll go to a pay phone.

696
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:13,356
No, I can't.
His number is in my phone.

697
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:15,524
Great. Well' do you remember
where he lives?

698
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,026
Yeah, I know where he lives.

699
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:19,320
What are you insinuating?
Like, I'm forgetful?

700
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,905
"Insinuating." Good word.

701
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:22,365
Do you know what that means?

702
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:25,534
- I do, believe it or not.
- It means, like' "to seem like."

703
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:30,498
Let's roll. I'm done With the woods.
Let's go.

704
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,667
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here.

705
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:36,712
Okay. Let's go. No. It's not working.
The battery's dead.

706
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,547
Wait.

707
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:40,841
What do you mean, it's dead?

708
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:44,553
What do I mean? I mean
the battery's dead. The battery's dead.

709
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:46,389
What do you mean,
the battery's dead?

710
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,058
How can I explain this
to you differently?

711
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:52,228
The battery is dead.
It ceased to live.

712
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:55,898
It's deceased now. The car
needs a battery to start, Saul.

713
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,818
How did this happen?

714
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,737
Well' we clearly fell asleep
with the battery on' and...

715
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:03,864
Oh' man. To talk radio?

716
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,409
- Yes, talk radio.
- It's so boring' man.

717
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,370
- Okay, okay.
- The car just committed suicide.

718
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:11,664
Shut up' man. I have an idea noW.

719
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:13,082
We're gonna go.

720
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,960
We'll walk back to the road.
We'll hitchhike.

721
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:18,087
Someone will pick us up'
take us to Red's.

722
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:21,465
Red Will tell us everything's fine,
everything will go back to normal.

723
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,925
How does that sound? Good?

724
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:24,927
- That's a good idea.
- Keep our heads on.

725
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:27,680
If we just keep thinking like this,
we're fucking gravy.

726
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:29,890
- All right. I'm in.
- Let's do it.

727
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,735
- Can I have my jacket back, please?
- Yeah.

728
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,279
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

729
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:45,364
Thanks for taking care of it.

730
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:28,407
Look, it's like my thumb is my cock.

731
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,079
That's not gonna get us a ride, man.

732
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:43,088
Here's good.

733
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,679
Thanks for the smooth sailing,
Sharid.

734
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,431
You're welcome.

735
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,939
- You're sure We can trust this guy?
- Yo, Red.

736
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:01,732
Who is it?

737
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,569
- It's Bruce.
- Bruce? Who the fuck is this?

738
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,906
- Saul. What's up?
- Who do you think it is?

739
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:10,115
Who's this?

740
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,243
I'm Dale, Mr. Red. Nice to meet you.

741
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,452
Dale who?

742
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,579
It's best if you don't know
my full name.

743
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,039
Dale Denton. He's with me.

744
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:19,542
Dale Denton. Nice to meet you' bro.

745
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,419
- Hold on. Let me get this lock' okay?
- You better.

746
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,880
- Get in here.
- Coming in.

747
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,758
- Y'all Wanna buy some drugs?
- Frisk me.

748
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,010
- What's up? What's up?
- Get it.

749
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,096
Look at that, huh?

750
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:35,516
- What's up, players?
- What's up?

751
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:40,312
I've been up in here trying to get
a motherfucking scholarship. Chilling.

752
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,897
What's up with the clothes?

753
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:44,942
We were camping.

754
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,569
- Camping?
- Yeah.

755
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:49,822
Is your lip okay' man?

756
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,032
- You been crying?
- Oh' my lip.

757
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,159
It's a cold sore.

758
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:57,746
Never had one before,
so I started to cry.

759
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,125
I think it's a lot worse
than it looks, though.

760
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:03,878
Cold sore?
Does that mean fucking herpes?

761
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,547
Yeah. Yes, it does.

762
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:09,550
Fucking sick' man. You know
how many joints we've shared?

763
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:12,428
I know. I'm a disgusting person.

764
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,096
Herpes is for life, bro.

765
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:17,766
I'm gonna try to definitely put
some sort of medical ointment on it.

766
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:20,561
Been taking Vicodin.
Doesn't really take swelling down.

767
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:22,438
It's from that time. I told you, man.

768
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:25,983
You ate that lollipop out of that
stripper's snatch. You wanted to do it.

769
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,819
Out of her vagina. Remember
what you did? What did you do?

770
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:32,281
You ate a box of Nerds
out of her butthole.

771
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:35,910
You fucking said you wouldn't tell.
You sowed your own poison, man.

772
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,746
Dudes' seriously, we're here
for a reason. Just ask him.

773
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:43,125
Chill. I'm boiling some eggs over here.
We got a lot of time to hang out.

774
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:45,044
- I'm making a fucking cake.
- No shit.

775
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,462
Can I have a piece of thatu

776
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,923
- Don't ask for a piece.
- I can't have a piece?

777
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,591
No, you can't. This is private.

778
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,509
Do you know what today is?

779
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,638
- Tuesday.
- This is my cat's birthday today.

780
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,974
I don't see a cat in here. I'm sorry.
You let it out by accident?

781
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:01,101
No, because he died
three months ago' okay?

782
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,603
So now who's the funny guy?

783
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:03,938
Sorry.

784
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,189
Today is his birthday...

785
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:08,692
...and it is a tradition
that on his birthday...

786
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,154
...I get up extra early and make him
his favorite kind of dessert.

787
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,657
Don't worry, bro.
Your cat's going to heaven.

788
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,492
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe he went to heaven.

789
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,786
He was a little fucker.
Could've gone to hell.

790
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:20,162
What are we talk...? Guys...

791
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,830
Ask him. Just ask him' okay?

792
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:24,124
Ask What? Just come straight.
What's up?

793
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,293
- Yeah, right.
- Lay it on him.

794
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,420
We need to know...

795
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,339
We need to know
about your source.

796
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:31,840
- Ted.
- Ted Jones.

797
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:35,678
See' Dale' here,
is a protest servant.

798
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,304
I'm not. That's not what I am.

799
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:40,599
He's not that,
but he was outside Ted's house...

800
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:45,771
Don't... Look' we don't want
to bring you in to What we're in' okay?

801
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:48,691
You don't Want any trouble.
We don't Wanna give you trouble.

802
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:51,276
It's probably best
you don't know the whole story.

803
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:54,321
- Don't think I can handle danger?
- What are you talking about?

804
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,365
- You can.
- I totally can.

805
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:58,325
And for you
to come into my house...

806
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:01,704
...and not tell secrets
because you think you're saving me...

807
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:04,581
...well, in reality, it just makes
you look like a dumb-ass.

808
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,000
Look at this. See this?

809
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,961
You see that?
There's no hair under here, okay?

810
00:43:09,129 --> 00:43:10,587
What's the significance of that?

811
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:13,549
It makes me aerodynamic
when I fight. I can take danger.

812
00:43:13,717 --> 00:43:17,428
Okay, has anyone called asking
about Saul or the Pineapple Express?

813
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,055
That's all we need to know.

814
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,727
Is it "uh-huh" or "uh-uh"?

815
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,895
- It's "uh-uh."
- There it is, man.

816
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:29,982
Cleared. Over.

817
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,109
Everything's fine. I told you' bro.

818
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,944
We had a Wacky night
in the woods...

819
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,739
...but we both can put that
behind us like adults.

820
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:39,033
Now it's time
to get super-duper high.

821
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,659
Got that bong I got in Tel Aviv?

822
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:42,161
"Bong Mitzvah." Hit it up.

823
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,038
Yes.

824
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:45,748
There you go.

825
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,916
Why don't you follow his lead
and chill out?

826
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:50,210
I'm chill.
I'm chill as a cucumber, man.

827
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:52,921
- You don't seem chill.
- More chill than you.

828
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,339
You're more chill than me?

829
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:57,051
Look at what I'm Wearing. Kimono.
What are you wearing?

830
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:59,094
- Suit.
- Yeah. Exactly.

831
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:02,473
I don't knoW what's up with you,
but I don't knoW if I like you.

832
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,767
Well' I don't know
if I like you either' man.

833
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:07,269
Well' that's your loss,
because I'm a great friend.

834
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:10,189
I'm gonna use the telefono
to call my wife, okay?

835
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,523
- Give her a call.
- I will.

836
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:12,318
- Go ahead.
- Don't pay attention to what I'm saying.

837
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,403
- Go ahead.
- Sit on my couch...

838
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,655
...my chillastic couch, and chill out.

839
00:44:15,823 --> 00:44:18,533
- I'm chilling right here.
- Don't listen to what I'm saying.

840
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,035
- This is private. This is my wife.
- I'm listening.

841
00:44:21,203 --> 00:44:23,413
I'm not trying to be enemies.
I don't wanna be.

842
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,248
- I wanna be friends.
- Well' then good.

843
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:27,041
- I wanna be best friends.
- Come here.

844
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:29,460
- Shake my fucking hand.
- Shake my hand. Okay.

845
00:44:29,628 --> 00:44:31,587
- See' we can be friends.
- I'm feeling it.

846
00:44:31,755 --> 00:44:34,966
- You feel that? We can be best friends.
- I'm looking through you, man.

847
00:44:35,134 --> 00:44:36,551
I'm looking through you too...

848
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:39,512
...and I see I need to paint
the spot on the wall behind you.

849
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,431
- I'm looking through you.
- Transparent.

850
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:45,268
- I see your intentions.
- I see your intestines and intentions.

851
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:48,604
- What'd I have for dinner last night?
- Cake.

852
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:50,898
I'll be right back.
Make this phone call.

853
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:54,402
Bullshit.

854
00:44:55,152 --> 00:44:56,945
No, no, no.

855
00:44:57,113 --> 00:44:58,613
- Liar.
- What are you doing' man?

856
00:44:58,781 --> 00:45:01,241
He's a liar. He's lying to us' man.
He's lying to us.

857
00:45:01,409 --> 00:45:02,409
No, he's not.

858
00:45:02,576 --> 00:45:04,452
He knows my name.
He's acting weird.

859
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,579
We can't let him
phone anyone, man.

860
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:09,207
Freaking out. You're paranoid.
Give him the phone.

861
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:10,625
I do not trust you, sir.

862
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:12,544
- You're paranoid.
- He's acting weird.

863
00:45:12,712 --> 00:45:14,713
Red' I'm sorry' bro.

864
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,464
- Jesus!
- Holy cock.

865
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:17,799
Fuck you!

866
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:19,634
What are you doing, man?
He's sorry.

867
00:45:19,802 --> 00:45:21,094
Oh' Jesus.

868
00:45:23,472 --> 00:45:25,181
Herpes!

869
00:45:25,516 --> 00:45:27,475
I don't wanna have to do this.

870
00:45:27,643 --> 00:45:28,810
Red' you're crazy' man.

871
00:45:28,978 --> 00:45:30,979
You brought the devil
into my house.

872
00:45:31,147 --> 00:45:32,856
- We're friends.
- I know we are.

873
00:45:33,023 --> 00:45:35,108
- That's why it sucks.
- Are you on meth again?

874
00:45:36,777 --> 00:45:39,279
Dale, he's hurting me!

875
00:45:39,447 --> 00:45:40,989
Toilet.

876
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:42,657
Flush.

877
00:45:42,825 --> 00:45:46,035
What we do in this life
echoes in eternity.

878
00:45:46,203 --> 00:45:48,538
True!

879
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:04,679
He's going for the phone
to call Ted!

880
00:46:05,306 --> 00:46:07,182
Stay out of here!

881
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:12,437
Red' don't do it!

882
00:46:14,482 --> 00:46:16,191
- Red!
- You assholes.

883
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:17,942
You ruined my portable phone.

884
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:20,320
- TeamWork.
- Yes.

885
00:46:21,614 --> 00:46:23,698
You're gonna break the door.
Gonna pay for it?

886
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:29,037
Fuck.

887
00:46:29,205 --> 00:46:30,580
Phone.

888
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:35,126
- Let go! Let go! Let go!
- What the hell...?

889
00:46:35,294 --> 00:46:37,837
I let go, now just get this
goddamn door off of me!

890
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:39,506
Tell us everything, now!

891
00:46:39,673 --> 00:46:41,007
Said they were gonna kill me.

892
00:46:41,175 --> 00:46:43,176
What did you tell Ted?

893
00:46:43,344 --> 00:46:45,261
He's crushing my balls.
Crushing my balls.

894
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:46,888
Smash them.

895
00:46:47,056 --> 00:46:48,097
Fuck!

896
00:46:48,265 --> 00:46:51,059
Time out. Time out.

897
00:46:51,227 --> 00:46:52,977
- Truce.
- Time in. Fuck you.

898
00:46:53,145 --> 00:46:54,938
- Stop!
- Cheater!

899
00:46:55,105 --> 00:46:56,898
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Red!

900
00:46:57,066 --> 00:46:59,484
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get...

901
00:47:00,736 --> 00:47:01,736
Fuck.

902
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:04,739
God...

903
00:47:04,907 --> 00:47:06,199
Fuck!

904
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:08,368
- Take it, motherfucker!
- Time out!

905
00:47:10,704 --> 00:47:12,288
Fuck!

906
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:17,126
No! No, no, no!

907
00:47:17,294 --> 00:47:19,170
Where you going, huh?

908
00:47:19,338 --> 00:47:21,422
Where do you think you're going'
Mr. Wiggles?

909
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,342
- Come on. Get back here.
- Saul, help me! Help me!

910
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:25,927
He's punching my bum!

911
00:47:26,095 --> 00:47:28,847
I'm done with this.
Let's talk. Let's try words.

912
00:47:29,014 --> 00:47:32,684
Use words! No! No! No!

913
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:37,272
You okay, man?

914
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:39,941
- I'll get you another bong.
- It's my cat's birthday.

915
00:47:41,277 --> 00:47:42,986
Happy birthday.

916
00:47:43,487 --> 00:47:44,529
- All right?
- Thank you.

917
00:47:44,697 --> 00:47:46,990
I think there's a package
in the mailbox.

918
00:47:47,157 --> 00:47:49,242
This ends now!

919
00:47:53,289 --> 00:47:54,747
Oh' shit.

920
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:56,708
Was that too much?

921
00:47:58,586 --> 00:48:00,545
Can't get the edge.

922
00:48:01,088 --> 00:48:02,964
Wait. Got it. Got it.

923
00:48:03,132 --> 00:48:04,299
Hey, Dale.

924
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:07,802
Think we're gonna have to kill him?
I don't think I'm capable of murder.

925
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:09,178
I don't think I am either.

926
00:48:09,346 --> 00:48:12,140
Maybe we could just convince him
to kill himself.

927
00:48:12,308 --> 00:48:14,726
Or, just not say anything.

928
00:48:15,853 --> 00:48:19,105
We need to find out
everything he knows, okay?

929
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,524
Wake up.

930
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:23,192
Hey, what's up' dudes?

931
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,446
What's up? Tell us everything noW.

932
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:27,655
Talk, Red.

933
00:48:27,823 --> 00:48:30,158
I'm gonna flex and bust out of here.

934
00:48:34,371 --> 00:48:35,580
Trapped.

935
00:48:35,748 --> 00:48:36,998
Not happening, Red.

936
00:48:37,166 --> 00:48:39,667
Okay. All right. Okay, I'll talk.

937
00:48:39,835 --> 00:48:44,339
Ted Jones, he knows you witnessed
the murder. He found your roach.

938
00:48:44,506 --> 00:48:47,508
He sent two guys over here,
Budlofsky and Matheson.

939
00:48:47,676 --> 00:48:50,011
Two real big son of a bitches.

940
00:48:50,179 --> 00:48:51,930
They're basically
out to kill you guys.

941
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:54,724
They're gonna kill me too,
unless I turn y'all over.

942
00:48:54,892 --> 00:48:56,726
So you guys are basically fucked.

943
00:48:56,894 --> 00:48:59,520
How many cops does he have
on his payroll? Tell us.

944
00:48:59,688 --> 00:49:02,482
- Well' there's the woman cop, Carol.
- That's the lady cop.

945
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:05,902
I don't knoW. He could have a bunch.
This dude is super well-connected.

946
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:09,030
And he has a really awesome
hideout too. It's pretty badass.

947
00:49:09,198 --> 00:49:10,782
- Oh' shit.
- What else?

948
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:13,159
He's at a war right now
with the Asians.

949
00:49:13,327 --> 00:49:14,786
They're in a drug war right now.

950
00:49:14,954 --> 00:49:17,288
Asians? What Asians?
Indians are technically Asian.

951
00:49:17,456 --> 00:49:19,040
- It's true.
- What Asians?

952
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:23,044
I don't knoW. What? Chinese?
Or Korean or...

953
00:49:23,212 --> 00:49:24,212
Vietcong?

954
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,048
Yeah, little... Just little Asian people.

955
00:49:27,216 --> 00:49:32,845
Like, the Asians with the guns
and the drugs, and not his friends.

956
00:49:33,013 --> 00:49:34,055
- Ding-dong.
- Hey' Red!

957
00:49:34,223 --> 00:49:35,556
- Oh' shit.
- Oh' they're here.

958
00:49:35,724 --> 00:49:37,058
They're here to kill me.

959
00:49:37,226 --> 00:49:41,104
Okay, I know I sold y'all out. I've been
a son of a bitch and a shitty friend.

960
00:49:41,271 --> 00:49:43,690
Saul, I'm talking to you.
Dale, you're a neW friend.

961
00:49:43,857 --> 00:49:46,067
I can make it up.
I forgot' "bro's before ho's."

962
00:49:46,235 --> 00:49:48,695
Just go out the back porch.
I won't say anything.

963
00:49:48,862 --> 00:49:50,238
- I'll cover for you.
- Thanks.

964
00:49:50,406 --> 00:49:52,156
No sweat.

965
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,538
It was Dale Denton.
Dale Denton and Saul.

966
00:49:58,706 --> 00:50:01,874
They're on the back porch.
You can catch them if you hurry. Go.

967
00:50:04,545 --> 00:50:06,129
Hey. In here.

968
00:50:06,296 --> 00:50:08,297
I've gotta get to a phone. Come on.

969
00:50:08,465 --> 00:50:10,091
- We should hide.
- Why?

970
00:50:10,259 --> 00:50:12,176
If Red tells Ted's guys
about my name...

971
00:50:12,344 --> 00:50:14,095
...then they'll go to my apartment.

972
00:50:14,263 --> 00:50:17,974
There, I have Angie's name. They'll
put that together, find her. Let's go.

973
00:50:18,142 --> 00:50:19,642
No. I think we should stay.

974
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:22,145
- Why?
- I'm in the dumpster already.

975
00:50:22,312 --> 00:50:25,398
Well' then, get out.
Come on, you're already dirty.

976
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,861
- They're gone.
- Well, find out what he knows.

977
00:50:30,029 --> 00:50:31,529
Red' it's your last chance, man.

978
00:50:31,697 --> 00:50:33,489
You gonna give us something
we can use?

979
00:50:33,657 --> 00:50:37,076
Matheson, you gotta be kidding me.
I mean, What more do you want?

980
00:50:37,244 --> 00:50:39,328
I told you that the guy's name
is Dale Denton.

981
00:50:39,496 --> 00:50:41,122
He's obviously working with Saul.

982
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,291
They came in here'
busted my house to shit.

983
00:50:43,459 --> 00:50:45,126
They kicked the hell out of me...

984
00:50:45,294 --> 00:50:47,462
...duct-taped me
to my grandfather's wheelchair.

985
00:50:47,629 --> 00:50:50,131
What more do you want?
Want me to read your horoscope?

986
00:50:50,299 --> 00:50:53,968
- You hear that' Ted?
- Ask if either of them were Asian.

987
00:50:54,136 --> 00:50:56,637
- What skin color were they?
- They were white people.

988
00:50:56,805 --> 00:50:58,890
Denton might've been a JeW.
I don't knoW.

989
00:50:59,058 --> 00:51:01,225
I don't judge people
based on things like that.

990
00:51:01,393 --> 00:51:03,770
Obviously. We're friends.

991
00:51:03,937 --> 00:51:05,229
Ted, you hear him?

992
00:51:05,397 --> 00:51:09,317
Dale Denton: Not Asian.
All right. Kill Red.

993
00:51:09,485 --> 00:51:12,987
Listen' I would appreciate it
if both y'all would take your shoes off.

994
00:51:13,155 --> 00:51:15,656
This is brand-new carpet.
You're tracking mud in here.

995
00:51:15,824 --> 00:51:17,492
Matheson, you got
British Knights on.

996
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:19,660
I ain't seen anybody wear them
since 1987.

997
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:23,122
What the hell are you doing?

998
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:24,999
Ted told me to kill him.

999
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:28,002
Well' how about
a little fucking discretion here?

1000
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:30,046
See? See? See, right there.
You see that?

1001
00:51:30,214 --> 00:51:31,339
- You catch it?
- See What?

1002
00:51:31,507 --> 00:51:34,592
You used to not give
a fuck about discretion.

1003
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,804
I seen you pull somebody's
jawbone off. I seen it.

1004
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:40,056
You was ruthless.

1005
00:51:40,224 --> 00:51:42,600
You was ruthless, man.

1006
00:51:42,768 --> 00:51:45,853
What the fuck' man?
You shot me in my stomach.

1007
00:51:46,522 --> 00:51:48,231
I'm gonna die now probably.

1008
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:51,818
I had you all over here for dinner.
Fish tacos.

1009
00:51:51,985 --> 00:51:53,528
This how you do me?

1010
00:51:57,074 --> 00:51:58,908
So, What did Budlofsky
and Matheson say?

1011
00:51:59,076 --> 00:52:00,701
I don't knoW.

1012
00:52:01,787 --> 00:52:04,122
There's this guy, Saul...

1013
00:52:04,706 --> 00:52:07,625
...something' selling weed who Works
with some guy, Dale Denton.

1014
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:09,168
That's all he got out of him.

1015
00:52:09,336 --> 00:52:12,755
Do you think he has anything to do
with the guy that We shot?

1016
00:52:12,923 --> 00:52:14,799
Well' did he say anything else?

1017
00:52:14,967 --> 00:52:18,219
Saul mentioned something about
"going to the casino."

1018
00:52:18,387 --> 00:52:20,555
- Weird.
- "Going to the casino"?

1019
00:52:20,722 --> 00:52:22,807
The Asians own the casino' Ted.

1020
00:52:22,975 --> 00:52:26,394
- I need another beer.
- He's gotta be working for them.

1021
00:52:26,895 --> 00:52:30,314
Maybe affer we popped that guy,
they hired this outside guy, Dale...

1022
00:52:30,482 --> 00:52:32,650
What's his name? Denton?
- To finish the job.

1023
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:34,152
Maybe.

1024
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,446
Maybe. Well, I'll be back in an hour.

1025
00:52:37,614 --> 00:52:41,117
I'll have everything there is to know
about this Dale Denton guy.

1026
00:52:41,285 --> 00:52:44,704
Who he's screwing'
who's his mother, everything.

1027
00:52:44,913 --> 00:52:46,497
I have to take a shit.

1028
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:50,501
Wait. Where are We going?

1029
00:52:50,669 --> 00:52:54,964
I gotta... I gotta get to Angie's.
I have to make sure she's okay.

1030
00:52:55,132 --> 00:52:57,592
What about my bubbe?
Don't think they'll go after her.

1031
00:52:57,759 --> 00:53:00,344
I mean, she has
a difterent last name.

1032
00:53:00,512 --> 00:53:01,846
Belogus.

1033
00:53:02,014 --> 00:53:05,349
I don't knoW. We should get out of
the middle of the road. Come on.

1034
00:53:21,491 --> 00:53:23,326
You guys can wait
as long as you want...

1035
00:53:23,493 --> 00:53:27,246
...but one minute from right now,
I'm gonna eat some food.

1036
00:53:27,414 --> 00:53:30,291
And you can call it rude.
You can call it Whatever you want.

1037
00:53:30,459 --> 00:53:33,878
You can be polite with your clean
plates' but I'm gonna be eating food.

1038
00:53:34,046 --> 00:53:35,087
Dad' he'll be here.

1039
00:53:35,255 --> 00:53:38,299
I'm going in the other room and eat it,
check my e-mail. I'm done.

1040
00:53:38,467 --> 00:53:41,469
Honey' we're at the table.
No one's going to leave the table.

1041
00:53:44,514 --> 00:53:47,016
- Okay. This is it.
- All right. Let's do this.

1042
00:53:47,184 --> 00:53:48,809
No, no, no. I'm going alone.

1043
00:53:48,977 --> 00:53:51,020
- No.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1044
00:53:51,188 --> 00:53:54,065
- I wanna meet Angie.
- You'll meet her later' man. Look.

1045
00:53:54,233 --> 00:53:56,817
Look, I need you to stay out here.
Keep guard' okay?

1046
00:53:56,985 --> 00:53:58,736
- It's important. Watch my back.
- Okay.

1047
00:53:58,904 --> 00:54:01,030
- Thanks.
- All right. Just be yourself.

1048
00:54:01,198 --> 00:54:02,907
I'll keep guard.

1049
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:04,992
Hey.

1050
00:54:06,411 --> 00:54:07,995
Shit.

1051
00:54:08,163 --> 00:54:09,705
Oh' no.

1052
00:54:09,873 --> 00:54:10,915
Hey, Dale.

1053
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:14,001
- Hello, Dale.
- Hey.

1054
00:54:14,169 --> 00:54:15,211
Dinner.

1055
00:54:16,004 --> 00:54:20,299
This is the dinner you invited me to.
That was tonight. That's why I'm here.

1056
00:54:20,467 --> 00:54:21,759
Sit. Please.

1057
00:54:21,927 --> 00:54:24,220
Of course. Hi.

1058
00:54:24,388 --> 00:54:26,013
- Hi.
- Shannon.

1059
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:27,807
- Intros.
- Great to meet you.

1060
00:54:27,975 --> 00:54:30,685
- Robert' if I'm not mistaken.
- Sit down, so We can eat.

1061
00:54:30,852 --> 00:54:33,312
- Hi, Dale.
- Hi. Okay.

1062
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,981
- What happened to you?
- Nothing.

1063
00:54:35,148 --> 00:54:37,024
I'm supposed to be here right now.

1064
00:54:37,192 --> 00:54:38,317
So I'm here.

1065
00:54:38,485 --> 00:54:41,654
- You're all dirty and bleeding.
- No, I'm not. I'm here for dinner.

1066
00:54:41,822 --> 00:54:45,658
- You have scratches on your forehead.
- Dude' you smell like shit.

1067
00:54:45,826 --> 00:54:48,494
- Dale' what happened to you?
- I was in the woods.

1068
00:54:48,662 --> 00:54:51,831
- In the Woods?
- Yeah. Isn't that weird? I was...

1069
00:54:51,999 --> 00:54:53,874
- I was in the woods.
- What were you doing?

1070
00:54:54,042 --> 00:54:56,377
I bird-watch. I don't.

1071
00:54:56,545 --> 00:54:59,463
No, I don't.
Look, I'm gonna come clean.

1072
00:55:00,632 --> 00:55:03,301
I witnessed a murder, okay?

1073
00:55:03,468 --> 00:55:05,386
I saW someone
murder someone else...

1074
00:55:05,554 --> 00:55:08,055
...and I think
they've been following me.

1075
00:55:08,223 --> 00:55:10,516
There's a good chance
they went to my apartment...

1076
00:55:10,684 --> 00:55:12,393
...where Angie has a lot of things.

1077
00:55:12,561 --> 00:55:15,521
Her yearbooks, report cards'
her cell number is written...

1078
00:55:15,689 --> 00:55:16,981
...and it's on my fridge.

1079
00:55:17,149 --> 00:55:19,775
So they could then find this house.
They could come here.

1080
00:55:19,943 --> 00:55:21,652
We should call the police
right away.

1081
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,904
We can't. The police
were the murderers.

1082
00:55:24,072 --> 00:55:26,615
We can't call the police.
They were the murderers.

1083
00:55:26,783 --> 00:55:29,452
Angie' I swear to God'
you do something or I'm gonna...

1084
00:55:29,619 --> 00:55:31,704
- So fucked up.
- No. Don't let him "gonna."

1085
00:55:31,872 --> 00:55:35,416
No, don't wanna. Look,
we gotta get the F out of here.

1086
00:55:35,584 --> 00:55:38,210
Let's go. We need to begin
to prematurely evacuate.

1087
00:55:38,378 --> 00:55:40,880
- Are you high?
- What? No. I'm not high. Why...?

1088
00:55:41,048 --> 00:55:42,882
You are high as a fucking kite.

1089
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,508
I'm not high. Let's go.

1090
00:55:44,676 --> 00:55:46,761
We're not going.
I'm coming back in a minute.

1091
00:55:46,928 --> 00:55:49,180
You know what I'm coming back with?
With a gun.

1092
00:55:49,348 --> 00:55:51,599
You better be out.
I'm not fucking with you.

1093
00:55:51,767 --> 00:55:53,768
Your gun? His gun?

1094
00:55:53,935 --> 00:55:56,395
Why do you...? Don't get a gun.
Why would he bear arms?

1095
00:55:56,563 --> 00:56:00,566
No, we need to go.
Everyone, I'm leading the parade.

1096
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:18,583
I just want you to knoW,
I always got your back.

1097
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:23,463
And I'm glad we're partners.

1098
00:56:29,929 --> 00:56:31,680
- This is so exciting.
- Okay, okay.

1099
00:56:31,848 --> 00:56:33,974
Is this where you're parked?
Let's sally forth.

1100
00:56:34,142 --> 00:56:35,559
Who is after you, after Angie?

1101
00:56:35,727 --> 00:56:39,146
They're drug dealers. I have reason
to believe that they're drug dealers.

1102
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:41,773
What are you talking about?
You're out of your mind.

1103
00:56:41,941 --> 00:56:44,359
- I know it sounds crazy.
- Hide.

1104
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:47,946
Dale! Dale! Dale! It's happening.
I was eating a Fruit Roll...

1105
00:56:48,156 --> 00:56:49,406
- Why'd you do that?
- God!

1106
00:56:49,574 --> 00:56:51,324
- Get it!
- Jesus! Okay! Just stop!

1107
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:54,745
- Angie' What did you do?
- He's one of the drug dealers!

1108
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,039
- He's my pot dealer.
- He's your pot dealer?

1109
00:56:57,206 --> 00:56:58,331
- I got it.
- Get it.

1110
00:57:00,835 --> 00:57:03,253
- Gross. Are you okay?
- Dale' who is this?

1111
00:57:03,421 --> 00:57:06,423
- He's my... Oh, shit. Get down.
- Dad!

1112
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:12,387
What was that?

1113
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:14,639
That was a gunshot.

1114
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:20,520
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

1115
00:57:20,688 --> 00:57:22,647
- He's with me.
- I'm the good drug dealer.

1116
00:57:22,815 --> 00:57:25,192
- Put the gun down!
- Put down the gun.

1117
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,110
You assholes
do exactly what I say...

1118
00:57:27,278 --> 00:57:30,072
...or I will take you outside
and fuck you in the street.

1119
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:31,990
- No, don't.
- Don't fuck us anywhere.

1120
00:57:38,206 --> 00:57:40,707
- Where's your gun?
- I don't need it.

1121
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:43,585
Kill motherfuckers With my hands.

1122
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:48,131
Get out your goddamn gun.
You're making me uncomfortable.

1123
00:57:58,768 --> 00:58:00,727
Anybody out there?

1124
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:06,191
Fucking hide-and-seek.

1125
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:07,984
Say, now.

1126
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:12,864
Hey, the food's still warm.

1127
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,119
Love it.

1128
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:19,538
I found a bloody fork.

1129
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:23,333
It's fucking freaky, man.
They could still be here.

1130
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:25,752
Did you check the rest of the house?

1131
00:58:26,796 --> 00:58:29,131
I'm about to check that bathroom,
I know that much.

1132
00:58:29,298 --> 00:58:31,591
Come on, Saul. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1133
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:34,261
Yes. We made it.
We're all safe' guys. We made it.

1134
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:35,762
- What are you doing?
- Get out.

1135
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:38,640
Get out of my car.
I can't believe you think it's an option.

1136
00:58:38,808 --> 00:58:40,934
Okay. Okay. That makes sense.
It makes sense.

1137
00:58:41,102 --> 00:58:43,228
Come on, let's go.
It makes sense. He's right.

1138
00:58:43,396 --> 00:58:46,815
- Stay aWay from my family. Period.
- So where do we go? What do we do?

1139
00:58:46,983 --> 00:58:49,317
Go to the Days Inn
downtown, okay?

1140
00:58:49,485 --> 00:58:51,611
Use a fake name.

1141
00:58:52,113 --> 00:58:54,114
Garagely. I'll contact you.

1142
00:58:54,282 --> 00:58:57,284
I don't knoW who these people are,
what they're capable of...

1143
00:58:57,451 --> 00:59:00,120
...but I Will keep you guys safe'
I promise that.

1144
00:59:00,288 --> 00:59:01,621
Fuck off, loser.

1145
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:07,169
Angie' you're a fucking idiot.
I say that With love.

1146
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:11,506
Okay, you call this Mocha Milkshake.

1147
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:15,135
This one here, English Breeze.
Charge $40 for these.

1148
00:59:15,303 --> 00:59:16,970
- Forty?
- Yeah.

1149
00:59:17,138 --> 00:59:22,601
This one, Da Vinci's Brush.
Call this one Bumble Bush.

1150
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:26,730
And this here' Spanish Trampoline.

1151
00:59:26,898 --> 00:59:29,149
Crazy With them names' ain't you, T?

1152
00:59:29,317 --> 00:59:31,526
What the fuck is...?
What is it, Spanish...?

1153
00:59:31,694 --> 00:59:34,237
Spanish Trampoline.
Used to call it Spanish Mudflaps...

1154
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:36,865
...but Troy likes to trampoline
so Spanish Trampoline.

1155
00:59:37,033 --> 00:59:39,242
- Almost the same number of syllables.
- How much?

1156
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,494
- Forty-five for these last three.
- All right.

1157
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:44,372
- And leave me the best stash.
- All right.

1158
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,583
It's Pineapple Express.
Get your ass up.

1159
00:59:46,751 --> 00:59:49,294
Yup' of course.

1160
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:54,341
So get this:

1161
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:56,092
We triangulated the cells.

1162
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:59,846
They smashed one, threw the other
in the woods to try to distract us.

1163
01:00:00,014 --> 01:00:02,015
It took an hour for Jared to find it.

1164
01:00:02,183 --> 01:00:04,893
And then he said
that he found Denton's car...

1165
01:00:05,061 --> 01:00:07,437
...filled with all these
strange disguises.

1166
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:10,857
A powdered wig,
a sombrero' leotards.

1167
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:12,901
I mean, What the fuck
does that mean?

1168
01:00:13,069 --> 01:00:15,570
Why don't I just call the Asians
and talk to Cheung?

1169
01:00:15,738 --> 01:00:18,031
Why beat around the bush,
you know?

1170
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:30,669
Hello?

1171
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:31,878
Cheung, it's Ted.

1172
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:33,338
Record this conversation.

1173
01:00:33,965 --> 01:00:37,717
Ted, what a surprise.
What can I do for you?

1174
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:41,888
Well' Cheung' my friend,
let me tell you.

1175
01:00:42,056 --> 01:00:45,976
You know, we both know
that you sent one of your very skilled...

1176
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:50,146
...hit men over here last night,
and I and my colleague...

1177
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:53,483
...made a little decoration
on our window. Should have seen it.

1178
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:57,028
We painted the wall with his brain.
Painted it.

1179
01:00:57,196 --> 01:01:00,865
And noW this Dale Denton guy?
You serious?

1180
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:04,619
Just stop it' okay? Stop it or you're
asking for war. Do you want a war?

1181
01:01:04,787 --> 01:01:06,037
- What?
- What?

1182
01:01:06,205 --> 01:01:07,622
- Hello?
- Troy?

1183
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:12,377
Dad! Get off the phone. I told you
I'm gonna call some hot bitches later...

1184
01:01:12,545 --> 01:01:15,046
...and this is the time.
- I got you your own line...

1185
01:01:15,214 --> 01:01:17,465
...so you would stay off mine.
Get off the phone.

1186
01:01:17,633 --> 01:01:21,094
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm not a little kid, I'm a man!

1187
01:01:21,262 --> 01:01:24,681
And from this point forward, I'm
not taking any of your fucking shit.

1188
01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:29,144
I love you, Dad, but the dynamic
in our relationship is about to change.

1189
01:01:29,312 --> 01:01:31,563
Troy, do me a favor'
get oft the fucking phone!

1190
01:01:32,148 --> 01:01:35,275
- Shit.
- So you have a son.

1191
01:01:35,443 --> 01:01:37,444
Sounds like a very nice boy.

1192
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,405
All right, you listen to me, Cheung,
you motherfucker!

1193
01:01:40,573 --> 01:01:43,033
It is on! We're coming at you
with everything we got!

1194
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,744
It's on, so you better get your head
out of your ass...

1195
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:47,579
...and be ready for everything!

1196
01:01:47,747 --> 01:01:49,622
You are fucking dead!

1197
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:51,875
You are so dumb.

1198
01:01:52,043 --> 01:01:55,545
Do you have any idea
how Weak you just made us look?

1199
01:01:57,006 --> 01:02:00,091
Goddamn it!

1200
01:02:00,426 --> 01:02:01,760
Totally sweet.

1201
01:02:02,178 --> 01:02:04,471
Ted Jones is slipping.

1202
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:08,266
We shall strike now with full force.

1203
01:02:09,435 --> 01:02:12,187
Your brother's death
will not be in vain.

1204
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:18,360
I gotta say, I've had, like,
a lot of weed dealers in my day.

1205
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:21,112
You're the coolest I've ever had.
They were all dicks.

1206
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,782
- Really? Thanks' man.
- No problem.

1207
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:26,409
I really appreciate it.
That means a lot to me.

1208
01:02:26,577 --> 01:02:30,372
It's' like, you're the first guy that I ever
sold to that I became friends with.

1209
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:34,459
They say, like, "Don't dip the pen
in company ink."

1210
01:02:34,627 --> 01:02:37,629
I'm totally glad
I dipped in your ink, bro.

1211
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:40,340
Yeah.

1212
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:45,637
We should get out of town.
That's probably our next move.

1213
01:02:45,805 --> 01:02:47,472
Just get on a bus and leave, right?

1214
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:49,641
Get bus tickets.

1215
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:53,269
Go to the next toWn.
Contact some police.

1216
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:55,688
You know what I was saying?
Like, I'm totally...

1217
01:02:55,856 --> 01:02:57,816
You're glad you dipped your pen
in my ink.

1218
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:00,151
But We should get bus tickets
and leave, right?

1219
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:01,528
What?

1220
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:04,823
Get on the bus? Leave?
Buy bus tickets?

1221
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:08,326
I only have' like, 50 bucks.
I don't think that'll even buy one ticket.

1222
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:10,203
What about your sack?

1223
01:03:10,371 --> 01:03:13,248
Oh' man' it's fucking killing me.
I feel like I popped one.

1224
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:17,377
No. That's unfortunate,
but that's not what I'm talking about.

1225
01:03:17,545 --> 01:03:19,003
I mean, like' the sack of weed.

1226
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:21,256
Couldn't we just,
like, sell some weed...

1227
01:03:21,424 --> 01:03:23,091
...get some cash
and buy bus tickets?

1228
01:03:23,259 --> 01:03:27,303
- Of course, man. That's what I do.
- That's what you do. Fucking A.

1229
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:30,265
Okay, so you're gonna buy tickets
for Saturday's game, right?

1230
01:03:30,433 --> 01:03:32,016
These guys are amazing.

1231
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:33,893
What the fuck do you want?

1232
01:03:34,061 --> 01:03:36,229
You guys wanna buy some chronic?

1233
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:44,529
What's this stuff called again?

1234
01:03:44,697 --> 01:03:46,698
Pineapple Express.
They said it eight times.

1235
01:03:46,866 --> 01:03:50,076
- Yeah, but don't call it that.
- Yeah, that's not what it's called.

1236
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:53,121
- Call it Banana Boat.
- Make sure you leave it at Weed too.

1237
01:03:53,289 --> 01:03:56,207
This can be a gateway drug.
Don't wanna move on to other things.

1238
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:58,877
- Cocaine. Don't do that.
- We don't fuck around.

1239
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:03,089
- Don't worry. Don't tell us what to do.
- Inhale it, Chachi. Inhale it.

1240
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:04,674
Who the fuck's Chachi?

1241
01:04:22,568 --> 01:04:24,652
- How much money you guys gotu
- Come on.

1242
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:27,197
You each get as much
as you can grab with one hand.

1243
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,657
Go easy. That's a big handful, guys.
Come on.

1244
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:33,495
- Keep it on the down-low.
- Don't tell anybody where you got it.

1245
01:04:33,662 --> 01:04:37,832
You got it from Saul... I mean' you got
it from Santiago and Dunbar.

1246
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,835
- Go. Come on.
- Go' go. Vamoose!

1247
01:04:42,922 --> 01:04:44,005
You fucking did it, man.

1248
01:04:44,173 --> 01:04:46,841
You are a good salesman.
You got it in you, man.

1249
01:04:47,009 --> 01:04:49,427
I'm about to go get some
celebratory Slushees.

1250
01:04:49,595 --> 01:04:51,095
Get some burritos or something.

1251
01:04:51,263 --> 01:04:53,264
Something to drink too.
Something good.

1252
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:55,850
See you' man. Nice.

1253
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:05,443
Don't move. Don't you move.
This shit hurts.

1254
01:05:05,611 --> 01:05:07,237
Don't move. What's in your hand?

1255
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,155
It's Weed. It's a joint. It's a roach.

1256
01:05:09,323 --> 01:05:11,032
- Right here.
- I was just smoking...

1257
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,743
I thought it was decriminalized'
to be honest with you.

1258
01:05:13,911 --> 01:05:18,164
I have horrible anorexia,
and it helps my appetite. I'm so sorry.

1259
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:23,127
Look, selling narcotics to my students
is not decriminalized.

1260
01:05:23,295 --> 01:05:26,297
- Okay. I understand.
- I'm the liaison officer for this school.

1261
01:05:26,465 --> 01:05:29,551
And guess what? I just saw three
students Walking from back here...

1262
01:05:29,718 --> 01:05:33,054
...with their eyes as red
as the devil's dick. You're busted.

1263
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:41,145
- On the hood. On the hood.
- Okay, okay.

1264
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:43,022
I'm on the hood. Come on.

1265
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:45,984
- Stand still. Stand still.
- I'm still. I'm sorry.

1266
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:49,862
You better hope it's clean.
Better hope ain't shit on this record.

1267
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:52,865
I'm gonna put my foot
up in your ass.

1268
01:05:56,537 --> 01:05:58,997
Oh' big sexy with glasses.

1269
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:04,794
This is Ofticer Barbara. Requesting
an update on fugitive Dale Denton.

1270
01:06:04,962 --> 01:06:09,507
I repeat, requesting update on Dale
Denton. I have the fugitive in custody.

1271
01:06:09,675 --> 01:06:11,676
425, 425' what's your location?

1272
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:14,512

01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,764
What? What do you mean...?
Why am I going down?

1274
01:06:16,932 --> 01:06:19,183
What did that thing tell you?
What are you doing?

1275
01:06:19,351 --> 01:06:21,603
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

1276
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:24,272
I wasn't doing things.
Why do you hate me so much?

1277
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,858
Hit-and-run' Mr. Denton.
Hit-and-run.

1278
01:06:27,026 --> 01:06:28,526
Two parked cars, tWo nights ago.

01:06:28,694 --> 01:06:30,737
One of them Was actually
a police cruiser.

01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:33,781
You gotta be the dumbest
motherfucker in captivity.

01:06:33,949 --> 01:06:36,826
It's the lady cop.

1289
01:06:57,264 --> 01:06:59,349

1290
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:01,768
I'll take this badge off,

1291
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:04,103
I don't work for the law.
The law Works for me.

1292
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:06,397
I been smelling something
in this department.

1293
01:07:06,565 --> 01:07:07,899

1295
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:12,904

1296
01:07:13,072 --> 01:07:16,908
Oh' no. What the hell was that?
What is that?

1297
01:07:22,915 --> 01:07:26,668
No, no, no.

Freeze, goddamn it!
Don't even think about it!

1300
01:07:33,425 --> 01:07:36,010
This is an old-fashioned
escape mission' buddy.

1301
01:07:36,178 --> 01:07:37,970
Stop this car!

1302
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,102

01:08:16,635 --> 01:08:18,803
- Turn on the Wipers!

1312
01:08:18,971 --> 01:08:20,638
Well' kick out the window!

1313
01:08:20,806 --> 01:08:23,558
- How do you drive with one foot?
- I don't know!

1314
01:08:25,561 --> 01:08:27,437
Fuck! I think I pulled my groin!

1315
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:32,150
Get your foot out of there.

1316
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:34,986
She's gaining on us.
She's behind us.

1317
01:08:35,154 --> 01:08:36,195
Her car's better.

1318
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:38,781
- Get your leg out of there. Seriously.
- I can't.

1319
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:41,826
Put it into maximum overdrive!

1320
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:46,414
Oh' no' no' no!

1321

Get it out!

1323
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:55,673
I can't see!

1324
01:09:01,013 --> 01:09:05,433
Danger! Danger!
Trees! Tree' tree! Squirrel!

1325
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:09,937
Hey, I can see
through my leg hole.

1326
01:09:10,105 --> 01:09:11,856
Nice! Look out! Tree' tree, tree!

1327
01:09:14,568 --> 01:09:16,486
You did it, man.

1328
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:19,280
All right! Look out!

1329
01:09:19,448 --> 01:09:21,532
Oh' shit!

1330
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:24,118
Turn around! Turn around!

1331
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:34,212
I'm scared, Saul. I'm scared.

1332
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,714
- Don't worry. I'm handling this.
- Do something.

1333
01:09:36,882 --> 01:09:39,133
All right, hold on. I got an idea.

1334
01:09:42,638 --> 01:09:45,973
Oh' shit! Oh, shit! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1335
01:09:46,892 --> 01:09:48,392
Sorry!

1336
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:51,270
What the fuck was that?

1337
01:09:51,438 --> 01:09:53,689
Fuck. I'm sorry.
I thought she'd just go past.

1338
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:55,733
- Why?
- I don't know.

1339
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:14,252
Oh' my.

1340
01:10:18,716 --> 01:10:21,134
Yes! Yes! We made it!
All right, man.

1341
01:10:21,302 --> 01:10:23,970
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- No. What are you doing?

1342
01:10:24,138 --> 01:10:26,931
You forgot me, you idiot!
Come back!

1343
01:10:27,099 --> 01:10:29,976
Come back! Saul!

1344
01:10:30,144 --> 01:10:31,478
- Sorry' man.
- Thank you.

1345
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:35,607
- Let's go.
- Wait. Get the handcuff keys, you idiot.

1346
01:10:39,278 --> 01:10:40,737
I haven't used a gun since Uam.

1347
01:10:40,905 --> 01:10:44,824
Angie' you have exhibited
poor decision-making skills.

1348
01:10:44,992 --> 01:10:45,992
Oh' this is my fault.

1349
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,912
And we have hosted violence
in our home because of it.

1350
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,039
- "Hosted violence"?
- He's a bad guy.

1351
01:10:51,207 --> 01:10:53,833
You don't see that
you have stooped way' way below...

1352
01:10:54,001 --> 01:10:56,920
- You loWered your expectations...
...of what you are worthy of.

1353
01:10:57,088 --> 01:11:00,006
...but this guy is so far beneath you.
You deserve much better.

1354
01:11:00,174 --> 01:11:02,175
Open your heart
to someone who deserves you.

1355
01:11:02,343 --> 01:11:04,386
Or don't have a boyfriend
at all for a while.

1356
01:11:04,553 --> 01:11:06,346
- We're stuck in this room.
- I love him.

1357
01:11:06,514 --> 01:11:08,139
- It's not your decision.
- Love him?

1358
01:11:08,307 --> 01:11:10,975
- You don't know What love is.
- I'm gonna date him.

1359
01:11:11,143 --> 01:11:13,353
- We're going to the police.
- That's what I said.

1360
01:11:13,521 --> 01:11:15,688
- I know.
- He said not to go to the police.

1361
01:11:15,856 --> 01:11:18,274
- You should listen. He's a lawyer.
- You come with us.

1362
01:11:18,442 --> 01:11:21,027
- He can't possibly work in law.
- I'm not going anywhere.

1363
01:11:21,195 --> 01:11:22,362
- You stay.
- We're leaving.

1364
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:24,614
- You stay in the room.
- Fine, go. Fine, go.

1365
01:11:24,782 --> 01:11:27,534
And we don't need the shampoos.
Why did...?

1366
01:11:29,703 --> 01:11:32,956
As soon as we kill
those sacks of shit tonight, Ted...

1367
01:11:33,124 --> 01:11:34,874
...I'm moving on.

1368
01:11:39,130 --> 01:11:40,713
Okay.

1369
01:11:40,881 --> 01:11:42,465
All right.

1370
01:11:43,259 --> 01:11:46,719
And I promise you
you're gonna be taken care of.

1371
01:11:46,887 --> 01:11:48,179
As sure as shit you will.

1372
01:11:48,347 --> 01:11:50,140
For now, this is what
we're gonna do.

1373
01:11:50,307 --> 01:11:53,810
We're gonna go to the farm tonight'
we're gonna move tonight's shipment.

1374
01:11:53,978 --> 01:11:56,563
Then tomorrow morning'
we're gonna hunt these guys doWn.

1375
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:59,232
Dale, Saul, the Asians.
Every last one of them.

1376
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,568
We're gonna fucking kill them all.

1377
01:12:02,069 --> 01:12:03,778
So smile.

1378
01:12:03,946 --> 01:12:05,530
Shut up.

1379
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:12,287
Say something in Spanish.
Go ahead. I dare you. Go ahead.

1380
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:15,455
All right. Are you using protection?

1381
01:12:15,623 --> 01:12:16,706
- Days Inn.
- Yes.

1382
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:18,750
May I have the Garagely room,
please?

1383
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:21,503
- Hello?
- Hello, is Angie there?

1384
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,505
- Dale.
- Angie?

1385
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:26,383
- My God' are you okay?
- I'm good. I'm fine. I'm great.

1386
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:27,884
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1387
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:29,636
Okay, good. I came up with a plan.

1388
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:31,972
It might sound weird at first,
but just listen.

1389
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:35,016
Dale. You know what? Drug dealers...
Let me tell you something.

1390
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:40,105
Drug dealers are trying to kill me.
And you. And my family.

1391
01:12:40,272 --> 01:12:43,149
I can't believe I'm in this situation
right now because of you...

1392
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:46,194
...and your addiction to marijuana.
I cannot believe I'm here.

1393
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,904
I can't be addicted to marijuana.

1394
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:51,241
A, I use a bong. It filters out
the addictive shit. Seriously.

1395
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:54,285
B, what does that have to do with
anything? I witnessed murder.

1396
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:55,745
And noW I'm dealing With it.

1397
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:58,415
This, that's happening between us,
this is normal.

1398
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:01,084
This happens to every couple
dating for three months.

1399
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:02,752
- We have to work through it.
- No.

1400
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,379
This doesn't happen to anyone.

1401
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:07,007
I should not be in this situation'
so fuck you.

1402
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:08,508
You know what? It's over.

1403
01:13:08,676 --> 01:13:11,177
Good. Fine. Whatever. It's over.

1404
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:14,681
Congratulations. Sad to happen
sometime, right? Why not now?

1405
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:16,182
What the fuck does that mean?

1406
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:19,019
It means that you are gonna go
to college next year.

1407
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:21,271
You'll get into
Godspeed Nou! Black Emperor...

1408
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:22,605
...and the fucking Shins.

1409
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:25,358
And you'll blow a bunch of dudes
and become a lesbian...

1410
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:28,236
...and I'll be here in fucking
Clark County doing shit-all.

1411
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,822
You're gonna dump me.
So, fuck it, have a good time.

1412
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,074
A lesbian? Fuck you' Dale!

1413
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:34,993
You never did like me anyway,
did you?

1414
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:36,703
You didn't wanna meet my parents.

1415
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:39,456
I always cared about you.
That's not what this is. Okay?

1416
01:13:39,623 --> 01:13:40,874
I always care about you.

1417
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:42,876
Why don't you ever act like it, huh?

1418
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:45,462
Why do you never act
like you care about anything?

1419
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:49,758
Because I'm high! Fuck! And it...
What do you want...? Okay. Jesus.

1420
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,968
Call me when I can go home.

1421
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:57,390
You lost it playing Bid Whist?
You pimp.

1422
01:13:57,558 --> 01:14:00,769
No, I'll give you more,
but you cannot gamble with it.

1423
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,646
I know' I'm sorry about the clocks.

1424
01:14:03,814 --> 01:14:07,942
I couldn't remember if it was today
or tomorrow. All right, I gotta go.

1425
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,652
I love you.

1426
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,988
You wise-ass.

1427
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:15,575
Hey, you all right' man?
That sounded pretty hectic.

1428
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:18,161
I'm okay.
Let's just get the fuck out of here.

1429
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:19,412
First things first.

1430
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:24,793
- Don't do that' okay?
- Yeah. Why not?

1431
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,128
Why not? Car chase' gunshots.

1432
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:28,755
That clearly just happened...

1433
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:31,257
...because we were smoking
marijuana.

1434
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,426
No, man. It happened
because those kids...

1435
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:35,762
...couldn't keep their shit
on the down-low.

1436
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:38,765
In case you haven't noticed...
Which you haven't.

1437
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:41,434
From what I can tell,
you don't notice anything ever.

1438
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:44,938
- We are not very functional when
we're high. Which is all the time.

1439
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:47,857
Well' I don't know, man.
I think I'm functioning right noW.

1440
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:50,860
I was, like' stoned when I saved you
with those Slushees.

1441
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:52,445
What do you gotta say to that?

1442
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:55,198
Well' that would be true
if you had saved me.

1443
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:56,491
But you didn't save me.

1444
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:58,576
She was gonna help'
you made things Worse.

1445
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:00,620
We're wanted
for all sorts of crazy shit.

1446
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:02,789
Don't fucking get on my case'
all right?

1447
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:04,624
Only reason I started selling pot...

1448
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:07,377
...is so I could put my bubbe
in a nice retirement home.

1449
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:09,712
- She must be proud of you.
- She is proud of me.

1450
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,214
I'm gonna become something.

1451
01:15:11,382 --> 01:15:13,925
As soon as she dies,
I'm gonna become a civil engineer.

1452
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:16,427
I'm gonna design septic tanks
for playgrounds.

1453
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:18,096
Little kids can take shits.

1454
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:19,889
You idiot. What the hell do you do?

1455
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:22,142
What am I gonna do?
Besides stay in my home...

1456
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:24,894
...for fear that you've designed
some object I'm around?

1457
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:28,273
I'm gonna be on the radio,
talking about life.

1458
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,859
- Giving lessons about life.
- Put me in my place.

1459
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:33,528
I'm gonna be designing buildings
and what's he doing?

1460
01:15:33,696 --> 01:15:35,530
Boring people to death on the radio.

1461
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:39,325
You are an asshole.
That's all you are. You're an asshole.

1462
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:41,327
- I'm not an asshole.
- You are an asshole.

1463
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:44,497
I feel pretty sure
that I'm not an asshole.

1464
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:46,291
I'm, like' a totally nice guy.

1465
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:48,960
I'm just as nice as you are.
So don't bring that out.

1466
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:50,920
In the woods, I gave you my jacket.

1467
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:53,423
You were cold and I clothed you.

1468
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:57,177
Now about in the park
when I said that you were my friend?

1469
01:15:57,344 --> 01:15:59,012
You didn't say anything back.

1470
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:01,723
Well' that's easy.
It's because we're not friends.

1471
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:03,349
You are my drug dealer.

1472
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:05,268
There's one reason
we know each other.

1473
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:07,478
I like the drugs you sell. That's it.

1474
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:10,857
If you didn't sell those drugs'
I would have no idea who you Were...

1475
01:16:11,025 --> 01:16:14,194
...and I would be fantastic right now.
Instead of looking like this.

1476
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:19,157
That sounded mean.
Just hearing it sounded mean.

1477
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:20,867
- I didn't mean to say...
- It's out.

1478
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:23,494
Monkey's out of the bottle' man.

1479
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,705
What? That's not even
an expression.

1480
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:28,583
Pandora doesn't go back in the box.
He only comes out.

1481
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:30,627
I'm sorry, man. Look...

1482
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:34,589
- What are you doing?
- Here. Have a nice last meal.

1483
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:37,342
Come on, man. Don't do that.

1484
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:39,594
Why don't you supersize it, bitch?

1485
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:42,180
I'm sorry, man. Look, come back.

1486
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:44,557
I didn't mean that.

1487
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:59,739
I love you. Do you love me?

1488
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:44,367
That looks great.

1489
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:53,459
Hello?

1490
01:17:54,545 --> 01:17:55,837
Dale?

1491
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:57,380
It is Dale.

1492
01:17:57,548 --> 01:18:02,427
Angie' I'm calling because I love you
more than anything in the World...

1493
01:18:02,594 --> 01:18:06,014
...and I wanna let you know
I'll do anything to make it work.

1494
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:07,932
I'll do anything.

1495
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:11,686
I've had a near-death experience'
and when that happens...

1496
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:14,564
...you can prioritize your life,
and you are it' okay?

1497
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:16,899
So please
just take me back, please.

1498
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:19,152
- I love you.
- I love you.

1499
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:23,489
- Yeah?
- I just don't wanna lose you, Dale.

1500
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:27,118
We were driving away from the house
and I just kept thinking...

1501
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:28,494
I don't knoW. I just...

1502
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:30,079
I wanna marry you.

1503
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:34,834
I made a mistake.

1504
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:37,337
- What do you mean?
- I've...

1505
01:18:37,755 --> 01:18:40,173
- What?
- I'm just processing that last bit.

1506
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:42,925
- You wanna... Oh, fuck.
- What?

1507
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:44,677
I don't knoW.

1508
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,971
I realize now
that if you would take me back...

1509
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:49,057
...then you are very naive
and immature.

1510
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:52,810
You don't see what a fuck-up I am.
I'm in no shape to be dated by anyone.

1511
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:56,105
- You're the one that's immature.
- I'm not immature. You're immature.

1512
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:59,484
I am somewhat immature,
but you're more immature. I'm older.

1513
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:00,943
Just because you're older.

1514
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:03,654
I lost my virginity
when I was 14 years old.

1515
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:05,990
- Really?
- How many girls have you slept with?

1516
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,242
- Like, two and a half.
- Two and a half?

1517
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:09,619
What is a half? Your hand?

1518
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:12,705
No, it was the tip or I dipped a ball in.
I can't remember why.

1519
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:15,541
I remember thinking,
"This doesn't count as a full point."

1520
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:18,086
If I said three, I'd feel like a liar.
I was drunk.

1521
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:19,587
Screw you.

1522
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:20,922
Get me out of this room.

1523
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:24,175
I will, and that's the last
you'll ever hear from me, okay?

1524
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:30,139
Oh' thank goodness. Okay.

1525
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:35,645
Belogus. Faye Belogus.

1526
01:19:37,064 --> 01:19:38,398
Lookit there. Lookit there.

1527
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:40,400
Do you use the pool over here?

1528
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:43,319
Yes, I use the pool. Come on,
what do you want from me?

1529
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:46,697
Your grandson. We need you to get
on the phone with your grandson...

1530
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:48,783
What are you talking about'
my grandson?

1531
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:51,702
You told me you wanna sit down'
play dominos with me.

1532
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:53,871
And noW you're hocking me
about my grandson.

1533
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,707
- Is that Yiddish?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

1534
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:58,000
May I call you Faye?

1535
01:19:58,168 --> 01:20:01,295
You can call me Faye,
but I'm gonna call you a stinker.

1536
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,005
Hey, Mrs. Mendelson.

1537
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:04,715
What do you want from me?

1538
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:06,259
Bubbe. Hey, guys.

1539
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:08,928
- Well' look who it is.
- Hello, baby.

1540
01:20:13,016 --> 01:20:14,058
Damn.

1541
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:16,310
Oh' shit.

1542
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,104
Sorry' Betty.

1543
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,861
They kidnapped my grandson.

1544
01:20:25,028 --> 01:20:26,946
Yeah, these tWo guys came in...

1545
01:20:27,114 --> 01:20:30,116
...they sat down with me
to play dominos.

1546
01:20:30,284 --> 01:20:32,368
I never saw them in my life before.

1547
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:35,705
And they kept asking questions
about my grandson.

1548
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:40,334
- What did they look like?
- One of them was very tall and sloppy.

1549
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:44,297
And the other guy'
he was very good-looking...

1550
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:45,798
...but he was short as shit.

1551
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:47,884
But the Worst part was...

1552
01:20:48,051 --> 01:20:52,430
...that my grandson came in'
why, and in pajamas.

1553
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:54,599
- You gotta find my grandson.
- Do the best...

1554
01:20:54,766 --> 01:20:56,017
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

1555
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:58,060
Absolutely.
You've got something there.

1556
01:20:58,228 --> 01:20:59,770
I believe that's a mole' ma'am.

1557
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:08,654
You sack of shit. Do you know
what a pain in the ass you've been?

1558
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:10,573
No, man. I don't wanna get out.

1559
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:13,576
Who gave you that lollipop?
Let's go.

1560
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:15,953
Where am I, man? What?

1561
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:19,582
You guys started it, man.
I don't even wanna be here.

1562
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,083
Shit. Did I do that?

1563
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:25,755
Hey, hey. All right, okay.

1564
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:28,257
Fuck you, man!

1565
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:31,135
- Stand back. Ted wants him alive.
- Why you holding me back?

1566
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:32,637
Ted wants him alive, okay?

1567
01:21:32,804 --> 01:21:34,805
I should be kicking
his fucking teeth in.

1568
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:38,351
- Lf anybody's gonna beat him, it's Ted.
- I look like hamburglar.

1569
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:39,560
And the Elephant Man.

1570
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:41,938
Like someone fucked you up
with a coffee pot.

1571
01:21:42,105 --> 01:21:43,856
Professional. Professional.

1572
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:46,150
- Professional on this, bitch.
- Whatever' man.

1573
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:48,444
- Where were you?
- I was there.

1574
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:50,488
- Supposed to be my partner.
- I was there.

1575
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:52,323
No, you wasn't.
How did this happen?

1576
01:21:52,491 --> 01:21:54,700
I take the hit?
That's how it's gonna be?

1577
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:57,245
Fuck all this' you know?
Get him out of here.

1578
01:21:57,412 --> 01:22:00,665
Take him doWnstairs.
Get this asshole out of my sight.

1579
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:03,000
I don't wanna go near this guy.

1580
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:06,128
What's down there?
Fucking rancor?

1581
01:22:06,296 --> 01:22:07,922
I might act tough...

1582
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,174
...but I got a lot of feelings.

1583
01:22:10,551 --> 01:22:13,469
And you hurt damn near
every one of them.

1584
01:22:14,513 --> 01:22:16,222
This ain't over.

1585
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:18,558
- You know you gonna die, right?
- Yeah.

1586
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:20,768
I'm gonna kill the fuck out of you.

1587
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:24,230
I hope you enjoy these last
17 minutes of your life...

1588
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:26,649
...because when Ted gets here'
he's gonna be like:

1589
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:29,902
"Kill that motherfucker."
I'm gonna kill your motherfucking ass.

1590
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:31,070
Watch your head.

1591
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:34,824
Hey, watch him.

1592
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,910
Oh' my God.

1593
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:40,413
El Dorado.

1594
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:42,957
The legends are true.

1595
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:45,751
Look at all this weed, man.

1596
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:47,670
What's that? Purple Granddaddy?

1597
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:50,214
- Come on.
- Purple Nurple?

1598
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:52,174
OG Kush?

1599
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:53,676
OG Kush.

1600
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:03,477
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1601
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:05,313
- What kind of irrigation...?
- Shut up.

1602
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,398
- Can I touch it?
- Come here.

1603
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:24,582
Hello?

1604
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,125
Red?

1605
01:23:32,299 --> 01:23:34,216
- Red?
- What the fuck?

1606
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:37,178
Get out of here' man.
I didn't do shit, Denton.

1607
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:40,473
Look, I come in peace' okay?
I'm not here to fight you again.

1608
01:23:40,641 --> 01:23:42,058
Good.

1609
01:23:42,225 --> 01:23:44,977
Because I'm tired' man.
Not feeling so hot.

1610
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:46,979
You don't look great.

1611
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:48,689
They shot me, Denton.

1612
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:50,149
They got me right here.

1613
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:51,651
- Yeah?
- Right here.

1614
01:23:51,818 --> 01:23:53,653
And then they got me again
right here.

1615
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:57,031
Look, man, I'll call 911 right now.

1616
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,741
They'll save your life' okay?

1617
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:00,826
- You don't need to die.
- No, bro.

1618
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:03,621
You don't get it.
It doesn't really matter where I'm at.

1619
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:06,040
If I'm at the hospital, if I'm here...

1620
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:08,334
...Ted's gonna find me, man.
He will.

1621
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:11,420
And when he does'
he's gonna fucking kill me.

1622
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:13,214
He's just, like' an asshole.

1623
01:24:13,382 --> 01:24:16,342
I couldn't agree more' Red.
That's why I've come here, okay?

1624
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:18,344
You know Ted? He took Saul.

1625
01:24:18,512 --> 01:24:19,887
And I'm gonna get him back.

1626
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:22,056
You know, like, he saved my life.

1627
01:24:22,224 --> 01:24:25,351
We've been on the run together.
He's a great friend. A good guy.

1628
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:28,354
He is. I'll tell you that' man.
Saul is a good dude.

1629
01:24:28,522 --> 01:24:29,605
I was mean to him' man.

1630
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:32,525
I wronged him and I can't...
I can't let it end like that.

1631
01:24:32,693 --> 01:24:36,362
I'm just into Buddhism
and I'm at peace with the fact...

1632
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:40,408
...that me as this person,
probably gonna not be around.

1633
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:42,535
Think about a hermit crab, okay?

1634
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:46,664
And it's a shell' and it's like
they go from one shell to the next.

1635
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:50,960
And that's what I am. It's like
I'm just a hermit crab changing shells.

1636
01:24:51,128 --> 01:24:53,504
Except' if you're a dick
your whole life...

1637
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:56,549
...your next shell
will be made of shit' okay?

1638
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:59,468
If you're an asshole, you're gonna
come back as a cockroach.

1639
01:24:59,636 --> 01:25:03,389
Or a Worm,
or a fucking anal bead, okay?

1640
01:25:03,557 --> 01:25:05,933
If you're a man'
and you act heroic...

1641
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:07,685
...you'll come back as an eagle.

1642
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:09,395
You'll come back as a dragon.

1643
01:25:09,563 --> 01:25:11,230
You'll come back as Jude Law.

1644
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:14,233
Okay? Which would you rather be?

1645
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:17,737
Maybe the anal bead. Might...
Depending on who it belongs to.

1646
01:25:17,904 --> 01:25:18,946
It belongs to me.

1647
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,573
- Then the dragon.
- Exactly.

1648
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:24,577
You need to help me, okay?
Just use it' you know? Use the pain.

1649
01:25:24,745 --> 01:25:25,953
You'll have a second wind.

1650
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:28,539
Let's get up
and go get Saul back. Use it.

1651
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:31,375
- Aren't you angry at Ted?
- Yeah, I'm really mad at him.

1652
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:34,712
What do you wanna do? Don't you
wanna get up, do something about it?

1653
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,173
Maybe that would be cool
to do to him.

1654
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:39,008
I don't think "maybe" is the answer.

1655
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:41,469
I think' "Yes, I'm gonna
help you' Dale"...

1656
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:43,429
...that's the answer I'm looking for.

1657
01:25:45,056 --> 01:25:46,432
Come here.

1658
01:25:49,603 --> 01:25:53,314
Ted Jones messed
with the wrong melon farmers.

1659
01:25:55,776 --> 01:25:57,860
Thug life.

1660
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:05,075
Oh' shit.

1661
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:07,953
Get those. I don't wanna
run them over in the vacuum...

1662
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:10,206
...and shoot my face off, okay?
- I'm sorry.

1663
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,882
I used to use this little gun
when I was a prostitute.

1664
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:27,973
Don't.

1665
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:29,809
Just something quick like that.

1666
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:31,477
- Don't.
- Yeah.

1667
01:26:31,645 --> 01:26:33,813
- Don't. You stop it right now.
- Stop it.

1668
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:48,911
Oh' God.

1669
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:53,666
That's a big hideout.

1670
01:26:55,585 --> 01:26:57,628
I can't do this. I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

1671
01:26:57,796 --> 01:27:00,756
I'm infected. My shit's all fucked up.
I need medical attention.

1672
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:03,843
What? I thought we just got all
pumped up. What was that about?

1673
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:06,428
Ted is a fucking murderer.
I can't fuck with him.

1674
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:08,681
I got a wife.
She's gonna be out of jail soon.

1675
01:27:08,849 --> 01:27:11,767
I wanna fuck her. I am not gonna
wake up murdered tomorrow.

1676
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:14,103
Oh' man' no.
This is lame of you, man.

1677
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:16,647
Come on. This could be
your moment of redemption.

1678
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:18,023
This could be your moment.

1679
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:20,734
I don't want a moment.
I don't want... Fine' go.

1680
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:21,944
Fuck you.

1681
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:24,280
Please come back for me.
Please come back.

1682
01:27:24,447 --> 01:27:28,659
Legends never die' dude.
I'll tell your story.

1683
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:32,204
Carol' she's cool now.

1684
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:36,333
Carol used to be a little crazy' man.
She used to throw tickle parties.

1685
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:38,794
- Sounds like home-cooking to me.
- That was fun.

1686
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:41,380
Game over, motherfuckers!
Everybody freeze!

1687
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:43,841
Tell me where my friend is
or this guy gets it!

1688
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:46,218
All right, everybody be cool' man.
Be cool.

1689
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:47,928
Put your guns down.
Nobody shoots.

1690
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:49,722
Put them down. On the ground.

1691
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:52,224
All right, everybody just chill.

1692
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:54,310
Oh' my God!

1693
01:27:54,477 --> 01:27:56,145
- You shot him.
- Put the gun down.

1694
01:27:56,313 --> 01:27:58,856
- Drop the fucking gun.
- Don't shoot me!

1695
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:01,317
- Holy shit.
- I said, nobody shoot. You shot Pete.

1696
01:28:01,484 --> 01:28:03,277
That's right. I shot him. I shot him.

1697
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:06,196
I shot him. I don't have time
for a fucking negotiation.

1698
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:08,866
Now' I wanna finish this off
so I can go home...

1699
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:10,951
...and have dinner
with my wife for once.

1700
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:13,245
If anybody asks, Denton killed Pete.

1701
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:15,247
End of story.

1702
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:17,416
I'm telling Ted.

1703
01:28:17,584 --> 01:28:19,376
- Lf you do...

1704
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:21,128
- Motherfucker.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

1705
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:22,963
He's got another one' in the side.

1706
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:24,757
Damn it. I got one more on my leg.

1707
01:28:24,925 --> 01:28:27,176
There's one more.
I know you'll find it. Take it.

1708
01:28:27,344 --> 01:28:29,511
I'm sorry, guys.
Sorry I deceived you.

1709
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:30,930
No. Come on.

1710
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:36,435
- Oh' great.

1711
01:28:36,603 --> 01:28:37,728
- Dale.
- Yes.

1712
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:41,065
What did you do, rat me out?
Is that what you did' you bastard?

1713
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:43,108

01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:47,780
No. You just got caught too.

1716
01:28:47,948 --> 01:28:50,324
And I'm gonna die in here
with some asshole.

1717
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:52,576
Okay, you know what?
I deserved that.

1718
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:55,579
I'll take that because
I have been an asshole' man.

1719
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:58,916
This whole thing is my fault.
I ruined your life.

1720
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:02,294
Okay? And I know there's no way...

1721
01:29:02,462 --> 01:29:04,880
...to make that up to you
except by saving your life.

1722
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:08,133
So that's What I came here to do.

Plugged him, just whacked him.

1770
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:20,099

Who the fuck is this Dale Denton?

1774
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:30,192

- Wait, someone's coming.
- Okay, okay' okay.

1781

If I cough once, I'll take the lead.
If I cough twice' you go, okay?

1782
01:31:58,471 --> 01:32:00,639

Yo, look. I'm gonna say this

See' I don't think
you understood me.

1788
01:32:23,454 --> 01:32:25,289
I can hear everything you're saying.

1789
01:32:25,456 --> 01:32:28,167
One cough mean you go.
Two cough mean you take the lead.

1790
01:32:28,334 --> 01:32:30,836
The belt buckle.

01:33:54,921 --> 01:33:56,672
Dale, no!

1812
01:33:56,839 --> 01:33:58,465
No, wake up, man.

1813
01:33:58,633 --> 01:34:00,509
No, you're not dying, man.

1814
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:03,262
Not without me.

1815
01:34:03,429 --> 01:34:04,763
- Dale.
- What?

1816
01:34:04,931 --> 01:34:06,765
You're alive.

1817
01:34:06,933 --> 01:34:10,435
- You're... You're alive.
- What happened?

1818
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:13,105
- He got your ear, man.
- He got my what?

1819
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:15,983
- He got your ear.
- Fuck!

1820
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:18,777
Fuck!

1821
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:22,531
- Help!
- My ear.

1822
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:23,740
- Yeah.
- Help!

1823
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:25,993
- You killed my ear.
- You shot me.

1824
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:28,078
- I didn't do that.
- He shot me.

1825
01:34:28,246 --> 01:34:29,288
You shot him?

1826
01:34:29,455 --> 01:34:31,665
- Get your hands off of me.
- Shut up.

1827
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:33,458
We've had enough out of you.

1828
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:34,876
I'm not your friend.

1829
01:34:35,044 --> 01:34:36,420
Maybe I can just...

1830
01:34:36,587 --> 01:34:38,588
No. No, infected.

1831
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:41,133
Is that it? Maybe if we just hold it.

1832
01:35:15,668 --> 01:35:17,336
It's clear.

1833
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:20,589
Dude. Look.

1834
01:35:20,757 --> 01:35:22,341
Nice.

1835
01:35:34,687 --> 01:35:36,188
Bullets.

1836
01:35:44,364 --> 01:35:47,199
So seriously,
how gross does my ear look?

1837
01:35:47,367 --> 01:35:50,702
Is it really disgusting
or is it' like, kind of cool in a way?

1838
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,913
Right now it's pretty disgusting.

1839
01:35:53,081 --> 01:35:55,040
I feel like I can smell it.

1840
01:35:55,208 --> 01:35:57,709
Don't worry, bro.
Think about Evander Holyfield.

1841
01:35:57,877 --> 01:35:58,919
You can't even tell.

1842
01:35:59,087 --> 01:36:00,212
That's a good point.

1843
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:01,755
Wait.

1844
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:45,841
Did you shoot that guy?

1845
01:36:46,008 --> 01:36:47,592
No. I'm out of bullets.

1846
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:49,302
Me too.

1847
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:51,763
Maybe it was ricochet.

1848
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:53,932
Gravity.

1849
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:55,809
Oh' nice.

1850
01:36:55,977 --> 01:36:57,936
You go down.

1851
01:36:58,104 --> 01:36:59,271
I'll cover.

1852
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:02,607
Watch my back.
I'll go down and take care of this.

1853
01:37:07,113 --> 01:37:08,947
Sexy motherfucker.

1854
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:29,968
No, no, there might be
more bad guys up there.

1855
01:37:30,136 --> 01:37:32,429
No, we'll sneak out through
the vent. Come on.

1856
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:35,807
I'll boost you up, okay?
And then you pull me up.

1857
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,352
Oh' nice.

1858
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:42,481
Here we go. Okay.

1859
01:37:42,648 --> 01:37:45,567
Get up. Yeah. Nice.

1860
01:37:48,488 --> 01:37:49,488
Nice.

1861
01:37:50,156 --> 01:37:51,990
Nice. Okay.

1862
01:37:52,158 --> 01:37:53,408
Pull me up.

1863
01:37:53,576 --> 01:37:55,368
I'm ready. Go.

1864
01:37:55,536 --> 01:37:57,329
- Give it to me.
- Come on.

1865
01:37:57,497 --> 01:37:59,956
- Be taller.
- Be stronger.

1866
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:02,125
- Pull harder.
- Dale' come on.

1867
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:05,003
Pull. Pull me. Come on, man.

1868
01:38:05,171 --> 01:38:08,006
- I'm jumping as high as I can.
- Denton!

1869
01:38:10,927 --> 01:38:11,968
Dale!

1870
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:13,678
I'll get help. I'll get help.

1871
01:38:15,473 --> 01:38:18,683
Go ahead and run' you little dipshit.
I'll find you.

1872
01:39:46,355 --> 01:39:48,189
Give me that fire extinguisher.

1873
01:39:48,357 --> 01:39:49,566
Okay.

1874
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:14,215
You and me, baby.
Drop it now! Put the bag down!

1875
01:40:14,383 --> 01:40:15,550

01:40:30,483 --> 01:40:31,608
Fuck you!

1877
01:40:36,739 --> 01:40:39,658
Fuck the police!

01:41:00,179 --> 01:41:02,514
Motherfucking kill you!

1879
01:41:04,934 --> 01:41:07,477
- Why you doing this to me?
- Why you doing this to me?

1880
01:41:08,562 --> 01:41:10,063
Oh' shit!

1881
01:41:10,231 --> 01:41:11,439
Come here!

1882
01:41:18,781 --> 01:41:20,699

Come on, bitch.
Come on, I'll twist your balls so tight.

1885
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:35,130
You're in the jungle now, baby.

1886
01:41:43,097 --> 01:41:44,180
Jesus!

1887
01:41:51,564 --> 01:41:53,106
Fuck.

- You killed...

But you weren't gonna stop.

1891
01:42:18,466 --> 01:42:20,049
Shoot him!

1892

Help.

1898
01:42:45,284 --> 01:42:47,035
I knew you were going soft.

01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:50,288

- You lied to me.
- I did. I lied bigtime to you.

1919
01:44:00,027 --> 01:44:04,488
Dale said that you didn't even
have herpes and I said that you did.

1920
01:44:04,656 --> 01:44:08,242
Honestly, like' from now on, from

01:45:31,827 --> 01:45:32,868
Shit. Dale.

1938
01:45:34,413 --> 01:45:36,622
Dale!

1939
01:45:36,790 --> 01:45:38,457

Yo?'re not dying today, friend.

1947
01:46:55,202 --> 01:46:58,079
Not on my watch.

1948
01:47:25,065 --> 01:47:28,275
Saul. Wake up, man, please.

1949
01:47:28,443 --> 01:47:29,902
Saul.

1950
01:47:30,070 --> 01:47:31,570
Wake up.

Oh' sweet Saul.

01:47:42,207 --> 01:47:43,999
Yes. Yeah.

1954
01:47:44,167 --> 01:47:45,626
Saul, you made it.

1955
01:47:45,794 --> 01:47:48,337
- What?
- Yeah.

1956
01:47:48,505 --> 01:47:50,423
Where am I?

1957
01:47:50,590 --> 01:47:52,633
You made it' man.

1958
01:47:52,801 --> 01:47:55,344
- You saved me.
- You came back for me.

1959
01:47:55,512 --> 01:47:58,556
- Yeah.
- Oh' thank you.

1960
01:47:58,723 --> 01:48:01,434
What happened?

1961
01:48:07,941 --> 01:48:10,359
Holy shit.

1962
01:48:14,281 --> 01:48:15,990
What's that?

1963
01:48:18,785 --> 01:48:20,619
Hi.

1964
01:48:20,787 --> 01:48:22,663

- Red.
- Hey.

1966
01:48:28,462 --> 01:48:31,797
Red. Where'd you come from, man?
Where'd he come from?

1967
01:48:31,965 --> 01:48:33,048
He came back to save us.

1968
01:48:33,216 --> 01:48:34,300
- He saved us?
- Yeah.

1969
01:48:34,468 --> 01:48:35,885
All right, man.

1970
01:48:36,052 --> 01:48:38,179
- We all saved each other.
- Yeah.

1971
01:48:38,346 --> 01:48:41,223
Oh' man. We made it, guys.

1972
01:48:41,391 --> 01:48:45,019
We made it. Oh, we made it.

1973
01:48:50,484 --> 01:48:55,446
Hello, you're listening to PPRPBP.
I am Dale Denton.

1974
01:48:55,614 --> 01:48:59,450
The topic of the day: New beginnings.
Getting over losses.

1975
01:48:59,618 --> 01:49:01,994
Friends. Life.

1976
01:49:02,162 --> 01:49:04,788
We have our first caller.

1977
01:49:04,956 --> 01:49:07,583
Yes, ring-ring-ring. How's it going?

1978
01:49:07,751 --> 01:49:09,376
Hi. Am I on the air?

1979
01:49:09,544 --> 01:49:12,588
You are. You're about
to get D'd by the Dale.

1980
01:49:12,756 --> 01:49:13,839
A D in the face.

1981
01:49:14,007 --> 01:49:15,341
- Dale Denton?
- Yeah?

1982
01:49:15,509 --> 01:49:20,179
You're my hero.

1983
01:49:20,847 --> 01:49:22,348
You are good, man. Seriously.

1984
01:49:22,516 --> 01:49:24,433
- Thanks.
- Gotta admit, you're pretty good.

1985
01:49:24,601 --> 01:49:26,602
- It sounds pretty good.
- It sounds real.

1986
01:49:26,770 --> 01:49:29,563
- It's not bad' huh?
- Lf I close my eyes' it sounds like...

1987
01:49:29,731 --> 01:49:32,858
- You are on the radio.
- That's the radio. That's a DJ.

1988
01:49:33,026 --> 01:49:35,861
- Lf you were on it' I would listen to it.
- Thanks, man.

1989
01:49:36,029 --> 01:49:38,405
It's like when my bubbe
was always playing opera...

1990
01:49:38,573 --> 01:49:40,407
...I hated it, but my bubbe loves it.

1991
01:49:40,575 --> 01:49:43,369
Then it grows on you.
It grows on you. Yeah.

1992
01:49:43,537 --> 01:49:46,163
It's like Red. I didn't like Red
when I first met him.

1993
01:49:46,331 --> 01:49:48,415
- You didn't like me?
- You liked him so much...

1994
01:49:48,583 --> 01:49:50,376
...I like you now.

1995
01:49:50,544 --> 01:49:54,004
I know this sounds weird, but can
we be best friends? Just us, for real?

1996
01:49:54,172 --> 01:49:56,215
- We should all be best friends.
- We should.

1997
01:49:56,383 --> 01:49:59,593
Seriously. You guys are' like,
both of my best friends.

1998
01:49:59,761 --> 01:50:02,555
You didn't know it. Now you know it,
we'll all be best friends.

1999
01:50:02,722 --> 01:50:04,932
Know those hearts that break up,
"best friends"?

2000
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:06,517
We should get a three-way one.

2001
01:50:06,685 --> 01:50:10,312
- I don't know if they make those.
- We should make the first one.

2002
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:13,399
I want the middle piece'
so it'll be crooked on both sides.

2003
01:50:13,567 --> 01:50:17,486
I know We've gone over this, but, like'
1000 pardons' 1000 pardons, please.

2004
01:50:17,654 --> 01:50:20,406
- I fucked up...
- I was a dick to you, man. I'm sorry.

2005
01:50:20,574 --> 01:50:23,075
I know I was an asshole.
I hope I redeemed myself.

2006
01:50:23,243 --> 01:50:26,120
- I know me and you had our deal.
- We've had some times.

2007
01:50:26,288 --> 01:50:29,164
I feel like something's happening here.
Is that a boner?

2008
01:50:29,332 --> 01:50:32,084
Is that a condo? That us moving
into an apartment together?

2009
01:50:32,252 --> 01:50:33,794
Is that us getting a time-share?

2010
01:50:33,962 --> 01:50:36,380
- You threw an ashtray at his face.
- You hit me, man.

2011
01:50:36,548 --> 01:50:38,924
At the time, I was like:
But it was kind of funny.

2012
01:50:39,092 --> 01:50:41,635
You hit me with a DustBuster' man.

2013
01:50:41,803 --> 01:50:44,930
I didn't Wanna hurt you.
It was like' "You better not leave here."

2014
01:50:45,098 --> 01:50:47,099
- That was such a good fight, man.
- That was.

2015
01:50:47,267 --> 01:50:48,726
You fuckhead.

2016
01:50:48,893 --> 01:50:51,437
- The car chase was awesome.
- You got into a car chase?

2017
01:50:51,605 --> 01:50:54,231
- Are you kidding me? Oh' my God.
- Yeah, it was...

2018
01:50:54,399 --> 01:50:57,318
I, like' had my foot
through the window.

2019
01:50:57,485 --> 01:51:01,530
My groin... I mean,
I felt like a wishbone.

2020
01:51:03,283 --> 01:51:06,493
- I just feel different about everything.
- Me too, man. Everything.

2021
01:51:06,661 --> 01:51:08,746
Like, I never Wanna
kill anybody else again.

2022
01:51:08,913 --> 01:51:10,789
- Ever.
- That's something you pretty much...

2023
01:51:10,957 --> 01:51:12,791
You can just kind of
dip your toes into.

2024
01:51:12,959 --> 01:51:14,835
We kind of dipped our toes
into murder.

2025
01:51:15,003 --> 01:51:17,463
I killed six guys, I think.
How many guys did you...?

2026
01:51:17,631 --> 01:51:19,506
- We each shot several people.
- A lot.

2027
01:51:19,674 --> 01:51:21,675
Some people get a taste for it'
but I don't.

2028
01:51:21,843 --> 01:51:24,970
I shot someone who was already dead
so that doesn't count as a murder.

2029
01:51:25,138 --> 01:51:27,306
Apparently you hit him
with your car, I'm told.

2030
01:51:27,474 --> 01:51:30,017
- That... You killed him.
- Okay, so I did murder somebody.

2031
01:51:30,185 --> 01:51:32,519
- You murdered, man.
- Not a big deal. That's cool.

2032
01:51:32,687 --> 01:51:35,272
- That's cool. Whatever. Kill or be killed.
- I know.

2033
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:37,232
I'm trying to decide
how stoned I am...

2034
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:39,610
...and just how on the verge
of death am I now.

2035
01:51:39,778 --> 01:51:43,238
Am I seeing shit because I'm stoned
or because I have no blood leff?

2036
01:51:43,406 --> 01:51:46,241
- You've been shot' like, seven times.
- You gotta eat.

2037
01:51:46,409 --> 01:51:48,160
- You're losing stuft.
- Yeah.

2038
01:51:48,328 --> 01:51:50,204
- Here.
- Yeah, okay.

2039
01:51:50,372 --> 01:51:53,832
- Here comes the airplane.
- Look, like a baby.

2040
01:51:56,044 --> 01:51:58,504
It's a miracle.
I think We should all take a moment...

2041
01:51:58,672 --> 01:52:01,256
...and think about what a miracle
it is that we got out.

2042
01:52:01,424 --> 01:52:03,425
And that we became friends
in the process...

2043
01:52:03,593 --> 01:52:05,844
...and learned some shit about life
and stuff.

2044
01:52:06,012 --> 01:52:10,224
Should we touch each other's hands
while We do it? Okay.

2045
01:52:12,268 --> 01:52:13,685
I love you guys.

2046
01:52:13,853 --> 01:52:16,229
I love you dudes so much.

2047
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:21,818
I'll remember that
for the rest of my life.

2048
01:52:22,695 --> 01:52:24,154
- Red?
- Red?

2049
01:52:24,322 --> 01:52:26,323
Yo, Red, man. You alive?

2050
01:52:26,491 --> 01:52:27,824
What's up, pal?

2051
01:52:28,743 --> 01:52:30,243
- Hey.
- Hey.

2052
01:52:30,411 --> 01:52:34,122
I'm like the nerd at the sleepover
who fell asleep at 9.

2053
01:52:34,290 --> 01:52:36,541
That's okay. We Won't put
our dicks in your mouth.

2054
01:52:36,709 --> 01:52:40,170
- Oh' God.
- Hey' there's bubbe.

2055
01:52:40,338 --> 01:52:42,464
Come on. Let's get out of here.

2056
01:52:42,632 --> 01:52:44,549
Yeah, maybe
we should go to the doctor.

2057
01:52:44,717 --> 01:52:46,843
Do you think she'll drive me
to the hospital?

2058
01:52:47,011 --> 01:52:48,929
Me too. I should
get the ear looked at.

2059
01:52:49,096 --> 01:52:51,348
My ear should probably
get professional attention.

2060
01:52:51,516 --> 01:52:53,600
- It is bad.
- That's a bullet burp.

2061
01:52:53,768 --> 01:52:56,812
Either I'm getting ready to die
or I'm gonna take a massive shit.

2062
01:52:56,979 --> 01:52:58,855
If somebody could get me
to the hospital.

2063
01:52:59,023 --> 01:53:00,607
Blood from my ear just...

2064
01:53:00,775 --> 01:53:03,568
You guys smell like shit.

2065
01:53:04,779 --> 01:53:07,447
You are in serious danger.
