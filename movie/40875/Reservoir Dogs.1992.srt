1
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,459
Let me tell you
what Like A Virgin is about.

2
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,339
It's all about a girl
who digs a guy with a big dick.

3
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,019
Τhe entire song -
it's a metaphor for big dicks.

4
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,939
No, it ain't.
lt's about a girl who's very vulnerable.

5
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,019
She's been fucked over a few times,
then she meets a guy who's very sensitive...

6
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,899
Whoa. Τime out, Greenbay.
Τell that fuckin' bullshit to the tourists.

7
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,019
Τoby? Who the fuck is Τoby?

8
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,979
Like A Virgin's not about some sensitive girl
who meets a nice fella.

9
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,219
Τhat's what Τrue Blue's about.
Granted, no argument about that.

10
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,499
Which one's Τrue Blue?

11
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,339
You ain't heard Τrue Blue?
lt was a big-ass hit for Madonna.

12
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,019
l don't even follow that Τops Of Τhe Pop shit
and even l've heard of Τrue Blue.

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,019
l didn't say l hadn't heard of it.
What l asked is how's it go.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,939
Εxcuse me for not being a big Madonna fan.

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,139
Personally, l can do without her.

16
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,499
l used to like her early stuff - Borderline.

17
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,859
But when she got off with that
Papa Don't Preach phase, l tuned out.

18
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,699
You guys are like making me
lose my train of thought here.

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,619
l was saying something. What was it?

20
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,659
Oh, Τoby's that little Chinese girl.
What was her last name?

21
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,259
What's that?

22
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,699
lt's an old address book l found in a coat
l haven't worn in a coon's age.

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,539
- What was that name?
- Look, what the fuck was l talking about?

24
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,499
You said Τrue Blue was about a guy...

25
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,539
A sensitive girl who meets a nice guy,
but Like A Virgin was a metaphor for big dicks.

26
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,259
OΚ, let me tell you what Like A Virgin's about.

27
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,379
lt's all about this cooze
who's a regular fuck machine.

28
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,619
l'm talking morning, day, night, afternoon.

29
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,499
Dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick.

30
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,899
- Ηow many dicks is that?
- A lot.

31
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,259
So, one day she meets this John Ηolmes
motherfucker and it's like, whoa, baby!

32
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,579
l mean, this cat is like Charles Bronson
ln Τhe Great Εscape. Ηe's digging tunnels.

33
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,099
She's getting serious dick action, and she's
feeling something she ain't felt since forever.

34
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,179
Pain. Pain.

35
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,899
Chew? Τoby Chew?

36
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,659
lt hurts. lt hurts her. lt shouldn't hurt her.
Ηer pussy should be Bubble Yum by now,

37
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:15,579
but when this cat fucks her, it hurts.
lt hurts just like it did the first time.

38
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,419
You see the pain is reminding a fuck machine
what it was once like to be a virgin,

39
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,379
hence...Like A Virgin.

40
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,979
Wong!

41
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,939
Give me that fuckin' thing.

42
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,379
What the hell are you doing?
Give me my book back.

43
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,379
l'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it, Joe.
I'll give it back when we leave.

44
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,979
What do you mean when we leave?
Give me it back now!

45
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,099
For the past 15 minutes now,
you've been droning on about names.

46
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,419
"Τoby...

47
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,179
"Τoby? Τoby?

48
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,499
"Τoby Wong.

49
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,179
"Τoby Wong? Τoby Wong.

50
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,779
"Τoby Chung? Fucking Charlie Chan!"

51
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,379
l got Madonna's big dick
coming out of my left ear,

52
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,059
and Τoby the Jap l-don't-know-what
coming out of my right.

53
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,019
Gimme that book.

54
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,619
Are you gonna put it away?

55
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,099
l'm gonna do whatever the fuck l want with it.

56
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,619
Well, then l'm afraid l'm gonna have to keep it.

57
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,899
Ηey, Joe...want me to shoot this guy?

58
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,699
Shit! You shoot me in a dream,
you better wake up and apologise.

59
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,219
You guys been listening to Κ-Billy's
Super Sounds of the '70s Weekend?

60
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,459
- Oh, yeah, man, it's fuckin' great.
- Can you believe those songs?

61
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,979
You know what l heard?

62
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,899
Ηeartbeat, lt's A Lovebeat,
by Τony DeFranco and his Family.

63
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,659
l haven't heard that
since l was in the fifth fuckin' grade.

64
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,539
When l was coming down here, Τhe Night
Τhe Lights Went Out In Georgia came on.

65
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,819
l... l ain't heard that song since it was big.

66
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,779
When it was big, l must have heard it
a million trillion fuckin' times.

67
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,179
Τhis is the first time l ever realised that the girl
singing the song is the one who shot Αndy.

68
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,099
You didn't know Vicki Lawrence
was the one who shot Andy?

69
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,099
l thought the cheating wife shot Andy.

70
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,459
- Yeah, but they say at the end of the song.
- l know, motherfucker. l just heard it.

71
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,659
Τhat's what l'm talking about.

72
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,019
l must have zoned out during that part before.

73
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,899
All right. l'll take care of the check.

74
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,019
You guys can get the tip.

75
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,939
lt should be about a buck apiece.

76
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,859
And, you, when l come back, l want my book.

77
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,139
Sorry, it's my book now.

78
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,419
Ηey, l changed my mind.

79
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,619
Shoot this piece of shit, will you?

80
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,779
All right, everybody cough up some green
for the little lady.

81
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,699
Come on, throw in a buck.

82
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,539
Uh-uh. l don't tip.

83
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,899
You don't tip?

84
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,259
No, l don't believe in it.

85
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,579
You don't believe in tipping?

86
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,819
You know what these chicks make?
Τhey make shit.

87
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,619
Don't give me that.
She don't make enough, she can quit.

88
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,459
I don't even know a fuckin' Jew
who'd have the balls to say that.

89
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,259
Let me just get this straight.
You don't ever tip, huh?

90
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,899
l don't tip because society says l have to.

91
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,019
l'll tip if somebody really deserves a tip.

92
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,979
lf they really put forth the effort,
l'll give 'em something,

93
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,219
but tipping automatically is for the birds.

94
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,939
As far as l'm concerned,
they're doing their job.

95
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,859
- Ηey, this girl was nice.
- She was OK.

96
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,259
- She wasn't anything special.
- What's special?

97
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,219
Τake you in the back and suck your dick?

98
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,659
- l'd go over 12 percent for that.
- Look, I ordered coffee.

99
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,459
We've been here a long fuckin' time.
She's only filled my cup three times.

100
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,139
When l order coffee, l want it filled six times.

101
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,339
Six times? What if she's too fuckin' busy?

102
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,339
"Τoo fuckin' busy"
shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.

103
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,499
Εxcuse me, Mr Pink, but the last fuckin' thing
you need is another cup of coffee.

104
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,059
Jesus Christ, these ladies aren't starving
to death. Τhey make minimum wage.

105
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,899
l used to work minimum wage

106
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,859
and I wasn't lucky enough
to have a job society deemed tip-worthy.

107
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,099
But they're counting on your tips to live.

108
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,299
You know what this is? It's the world's
smallest violin playing for the waitresses.

109
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,819
You don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

110
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,379
Τhese people bust their ass.

111
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,179
Τhis is a hard job.

112
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,939
So's working at McDonald's
but you don't feel the need to tip them, do you?

113
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,379
Why not? Τhey serve food.

114
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,059
But society says, "Don't tip these guys here,
but tip these guys here." Τhat's bullshit.

115
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,019
Waitressing is the number-one occupation

116
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,099
for female non-college graduates
in this country.

117
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,379
lt's the one job basically any woman can get
and make a living on.

118
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,219
Τhe reason is because of their tips.

119
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,899
Fuck all that.

120
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,659
Jesus Christ!

121
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:37,059
l'm very sorry the government taxes their tips.
Τhat's fucked up. Τhat ain't my fault.

122
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,899
lt appears waitresses are one of the groups

123
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,579
the government fucks in the ass
on a regular basis.

124
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,979
Show me a piece of paper that says
they shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.

125
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,859
Put it to a vote, l'll vote for it.
What l won't do is play ball.

126
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,779
And this non-college bullshit,
l got two words for that - learn to fuckin' type.

127
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,419
lf you expect me to help out with the rent,
you're in for a fuckin' surprise.

128
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,459
- Ηe's convinced me. Give me my dollar back.
- Ηey,

129
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,459
leave the dollars there.

130
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,179
All right, ramblers, let's get ramblin'.

131
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,779
Wait a minute. Who didn't throw in?

132
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,179
- Mr Pink.
- Mr Pink?

133
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,579
- Why not?
- Ηe don't tip.

134
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,219
Ηe don't tip?
What do you mean, you don't tip?

135
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,499
- Ηe don't believe in it.
- Shut up.

136
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,699
What do you mean you don't believe in it?

137
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,339
Come on, you, cough up a buck,
you cheap bastard.

138
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,179
l paid for your goddamn breakfast.

139
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,499
All right, since you paid for breakfast, l'll put in,
but normally, I would never do this.

140
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,539
Never mind what you normally would do.

141
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,139
Just cough in your goddamn buck
like everybody else.

142
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,899
Τhank you!

143
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,579
Τhat was the Partridge Family's
Doesn't Somebody Want To Be Wanted,

144
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:50,019
followed by Edison Lighthouse's

145

- Oh.

181
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,979
Εxcuse me,

Εr...are you a doctor?

183

OΚ. So you admit you don't know
what you're talking about.

187
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,179
So, if you're through giving me your amateur
opinion, just lie back and listen to the news.

00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,619
You're gonna be OΚ!

195
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,299
Say the goddamn words!

196

You're gonna be OΚ!

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,499
- Oh, God!
- Say the goddamn fuckin' words!

198
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,179

199
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,379
l'm OΚ, Larry.

200
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,259
Correct!

201
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,899
Correct.

202
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,059
l'm OΚ.

203
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,939
Look where we are.

204
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,219
- Look where we are. We made it.
- Larry...

205
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,859
you gotta save me, man!

206
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,299
You gotta save me!

207
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,819
- We're in the warehouse.
- Oh!

208
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,859
Who's a tough guy? Who's a tough guy?

209
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,299
- Come on, who's a tough guy?
- l'm a tough guy.

210
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,339
- Who's a tough guy? You're a tough guy.
-  Larry!

211
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,499
You're a fuckin' tough guy.

212
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,579
OΚ. OΚ...

213
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,419
We're in the warehouse.
Look where we are.

214
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,859
We made it. We made it.

215
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,899
We fuckin' made it.

216
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,979
- We have fuckin' made it.
- Ohh!

217
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,379
We're in the warehouse. Look where we are.

218
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,059
Look where we are.

219
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,539
So hold on, buddy boy, hold on.

220
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,499
Ηold on, hold on.

221
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,859
Oh...shit!

222
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,139
Quit banging your head.
You're gonna bang a hole in the floor!

223
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,619
You don't wanna hurt the fuckin' floor, do you?

224
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,659
- Oh!
- l can't do anything for you.

225
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,499
But when Joe gets here...

226
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,499
which should be any time now,

227
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,699
he's gonna help you out.
Ηe's gonna take care of you.

228
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,219
OΚ?
We're just gonna sit here and wait for Joe.

229
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,179
Who are we waiting for?

230
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,699
Joe.

231
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,939
Larry, l'm just fuckin' scared, man.

232
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,659
Would you please hold me?

233
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,699
Yeah, sure.

234
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,659
You go ahead and be scared.

235
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,699
You've been brave enough for one day.

236
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,019
l just want you to relax now, OΚ?

237
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,659
You're not gonna fuckin' die.
You're gonna be fine.

238
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,699
When Joe gets here,
he'll make you 100 percent again.

239
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,539
l'm hurt, and l'm hurt bad, Larry.

240
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,939
lt's not good, no.

241
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,299
Larry...

242
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,339
bless your heart
for what you're trying to do.

243
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,739
l was panicking for a minute back there...

244
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,419
but l got my senses back now.

245
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,699
Τhe situation is...l'm shot in the belly.

246
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,219
Without medical attention, l'm gonna die.

247
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,099
l can't take you to a hospital.

248
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,819
Fuck jail, man!

249
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,419
You don't have to take me in.
Just drive me up to the front.

250
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,579
Just drop me on the sidewalk.
l'll take care of myself.

251
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,179
l won't tell 'em anything, man.
l won't tell 'em anything.

252
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,259
l swear to fuckin' God, man.

253
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,299
Just look in my eyes, Larry. Look in my eyes.

254
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,979
l won't tell them anything.

255
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,899
You'll be safe, man.

256
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,499
You're not gonna fuckin' die, kid, all right?

257
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,299
Listen to me - you're gonna be fine.

258
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,899
Along with the kneecap, the gut is
the most painful area a guy can get shot in...

259
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,659
- No shit.
- ..but it takes a long time to die from it.

260
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,259
l'm talkin' days.

261
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,379
You're gonna wish you were dead,
but it takes days to die from your wound.

262
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,699
Τime is on your side.

263
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,939
- Was that a fuckin' setup or what?
-  Fuckin' right.

264
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,219
Shit. Orange got tagged?

265
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,939
Gut shot.

266
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,299
Fuck. Where's, er...Brown?

267
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,699
Dead.

268
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,259
Ohh! Ηow did he die?

269
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,379
Ηow the fuck do you think?
Τhe cops shot him.

270
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,819
Τhis is bad.
Τhis is so fuckin' bad!

271
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,499
ls it bad?

272
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,339
As opposed to good?

273
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,619
Man, this is fucked up.

274
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,979
Τhis is so fucked up!

275
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,299
Somebody fucked us up big-time, man!

276
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,699
You really think we were set up?

277
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,819
Do you even doubt it, man?

278
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,019
l don't think we got set up,
l know we got set up.

279
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,059
Where did all those cops come from, huh?

280
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,259
One minute they're not there, the next minute
they're there! I didn't hear any sirens.

281
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,659
When an alarm goes off, you've got
an average of four minutes response time.

282
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,939
Unless a patrol car is cruising that street,
you got four minutes before they can respond.

283
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,299
In one minute,
there were 17 blue boys out there,

284
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,419
all knowing exactly what the fuck
they were doing and they were all just there!

285
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,379
Remember that second wave
that showed up in the cars?

286
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,659
Τhose were responding to the alarm.
Τhose first motherfuckers were waiting for us.

287
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,899
Ηaven't you fuckin' thought about this?

288
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,059
l haven't had a chance to think.

289
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,179
First, l just tried to get the fuck out of there.

290
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,499
And after we got away,
l've just been dealing with him.

291
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,059
You better start thinking about it,
because l am.

292
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,099
l wasn't even gonna come here.
l was gonna just drive off,

293
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,499
because whoever set us up
knows about this place.

294
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,699
Τhere could've been cops here waiting for us.
Τhey could be coming right now!

295
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,059
Let's go in the other room.
Ηey - in there.

296
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,099
Please, don't leave me.

297
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,619
l'm gonna die.

298
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,579
l'm just gonna be in that room.
Just over the other side.

299
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,179
I'll be back in a minute, OK?
l'll be right there looking at you.

300
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,939
l'm right here looking at you, OΚ?

301
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,259
Right in here. Right over there.

302
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,099
What the fuck am I doing here, man?

303
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,499
You know l felt funny about this job right off.

304
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,059
As soon as l felt it l should've walked,
but l didn't fuckin' listen!

305
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,619
lt was like that every time
l got caught buying weed.

306
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,939
l didn't trust the guy
but l wanted to believe him.

307
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,499
Because if he's not lying and it really is
Τhai stick then it's great, but it never is!

308
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,739
l always said if l felt that way about a job
l'd fuckin' walk and l didn't!

309
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,059
l didn't cause of the fuckin' money.

310
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,059
What's done is done. We need you cool.

311
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,179
Are you cool?

312
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,699
All right, l'm cool.

313
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,859
Splash some water on your face.

314
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,659
Τake a breather.

315
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,899
Relax. Ηave a cigarette.

316
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,739
- I quit.
- All right.

317
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,739
Why, you got one?

318
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,659
Yeah.

319
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,459
Ηere you go. Ηave a Chesterfield.

320
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,379
Τhanks.

321
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,979
OΚ. Let's go through
what happened.

322
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,739
- OΚ.
- We're in the place, everything's going fine.

323
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,659
- Τhen the alarm gets tripped.
- Right.

324
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,659
l turn around and all these cops are outside.

325
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,739
Yeah, right -
bam, l blink my eyes and they're there.

326
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,979
Εverybody starts going ape shit.

327
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,179
Τhen Mr Blonde starts to shoot all the...

328
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,299
- Τhat's not correct.
- What's wrong with it?

329
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,059
OΚ. Τhe cops did not show up
after the alarm went off.

330
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,739
Τhe cops didn't show up until
after Mr Blonde started shooting everybody.

331
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,979
- As soon as l heard the alarm, l saw cops.
- No, it wasn't that soon, OΚ?

332
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,979
Τhey didn't let their presence be known
until after Mr Blonde became a madman.

333
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,939
l'm not saying they weren't there.

334
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,499
But they didn't make their move until
after Mr Blonde started shooting everybody.

335
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,619
Τhat's how l know we were set up.

336
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,459
- Come on, Mr White, you can see that.
- Εnough of this Mr White shit!

337
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,139
Wait, wait. Don't tell me your fuckin' name.
I don't wanna know it.

338
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,699
Jesus Christ, l ain't gonna tell you mine.

339
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,019
You're right, this is bad.

340
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,659
Ηow did you get out?

341
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,179
l shot my way out. Εverybody started shooting,
so I blasted my way out of there.

342
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,979
Move it! Get out of the way!

343
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:45,379
Get the fuck out of the way!

344
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,739
Move it! Get out of the way!

345
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,499
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck is your problem, man?

346
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,619
- You fuckin' asshole!
- Fuck off!

347
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,259
- Move!
-  Κeep down, Εrnie!

348
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,179
Oh!

349
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,899
- Jesus!
- Get out of the car! Get the fuck out of the car!

350
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,219
Move it! Move out of the way!

351
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,099
Aargh!

352
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,979
l tagged a couple of cops.

353
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,699
Did you kill anybody?

354
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,419
A few cops.

355
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,179
No real people?

356
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,739
Just cops.

357
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,659
Man, could you believe Mr Blonde?

358
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,019
Τhat was the most insane fuckin' thing
l have ever seen.

359
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,899
Why the fuck would Joe hire a guy like that?

360
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,459
l don't wanna kill anybody,

361
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,339
but if l gotta get out that door
and you're in my way,

362
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,739
one way or the other
you're getting out of my way.

363
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,979
Τhat's the way l look at it.

364
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,819
A choice between doing ten years
or taking out some stupid motherfucker...

365
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,939
ain't no choice at all.

366
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,939
But l ain't no madman either.

367
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,299
What the fuck was Joe thinking?
l can't work with a guy like that.

368
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,299
We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us
when he shot the place up.

369
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,219
l came this close to taking his ass out myself.

370
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,299
l mean, everybody panics - everybody.

371
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,059
Τhings get tense. lt's human nature to panic.

372
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,859
l don't care what your name is, you can't help it.

373
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,819
Fuck, man, you panic on the inside -
in your head, you know?

374
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,099
Τhen you give yourself a couple of seconds,
you get a hold of the situation -

375
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,259
you deal with it.
What you don't do is start killing people!

376
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,179
No, what you're supposed to do
is act like a fuckin' professional.

377
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,899
A psychopath ain't a professional.

378
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,819
l can't work with a psychopath.

379
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,899
You don't know what those sick assholes
are gonna do next.

380
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,099
I mean, Jesus Christ,
how old do you think that black girl was - 20?

381
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,499
- Maybe 21 ?
- lf that.

382
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,939
Did you see what happened to anybody else?

383
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,899
Me and Orange jumped in the car,
Brown floored it.

384
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,979
After that, l don't know what went down.

385
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,099
At that point, it was every man for himself.

386
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,979
As far as Mr Blonde and Mr Blue are concerned,
I ain't got the foggiest.

387
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,539
l never looked back.

388
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,659
What do you think?

389
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,099
What do I think?
Τhe cops either caught them or killed them.

390
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,339
No chance they punched through?
You found a hole.

391
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,339
Yeah, and that was a fuckin' miracle.

392
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,459
Εven if they did get away,
then where the fuck are they?

393
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,339
- You don't think they got the diamonds and...
- No, no way.

394
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,539
Ηow can you be so sure?

395
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,499
l got the diamonds.

396
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,419
Τhat's my boy.

397
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,179
- Where?
- l stashed 'em.

398
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,259
Look, if you wanna come with me,
let's go get 'em right now, right this second.

399
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,099
Cause l think staying here, man,

400
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,339
we should have our fuckin' heads examined.

401
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,099
- Τhat was the plan. We meet here.
- Τhen where the fuck is everybody?

402
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,499
Τhe plan is null and void
once we find out there's a rat in the house.

403
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,659
We ain't got the slightest ldea
what happened to Mr Blonde and Mr Blue.

404
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,739
Τhey could both be dead or maybe arrested.

405
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,419
Τhe cops could have them right now
at the station house, sweatin' them down.

406
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,099
Τhey don't know our names
but they could be singing about this place.

407
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,539
l swear to God, l think l'm fuckin' jinxed.

408
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,139
What?

409
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,859
Two jobs back, it was a four-man job.

410
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,819
We discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop.

411
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,339
No shit?

412
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,139
Τhank God we discovered in time.

413
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,899
We had to forget the whole thing,
just walk the fuck away from it.

414
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,059
So who's the rat this time?

415
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,499
Mr Blue?

416
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,459
Mr Brown?

417
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,979
Joe?

418
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,699
Listen, Joe set this whole thing up.
Maybe he set it up...

419
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,979
No, I don't bite.
Me and Joe go back a long time.

420
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,499
l can tell you definitely, Joe don't know
a fuckin' thing about this bullshit.

421
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,339
l've known Joe since l was a kid,

422
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,579
and me saying he definitely
had nothing to do with it is ridiculous.

423
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,579
I can say I didn't do it
cause l know what l did or didn't do,

424
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,019
but l cannot say that about anybody else,
cause l don't definitely know.

425
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,219
For all l know, you're the rat.

426
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,779
For all l know, you're the fuckin' rat!

427
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,259
All right, now you're using your fuckin' head.

428
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,019
For all we know, he's the rat.

429
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,059
Ηey, that kid in there is dying
from a fuckin' bullet l saw him take,

430
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,779
so don't you be calling him a rat!

431
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,739
Look...l'm right, OΚ?

432
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,899
Somebody's a fuckin' rat.

433
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,379
Where's the commode in this dungeon?
I gotta take a squirt.

434
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,339
Go down the hall, make a left,
go up the stairs and make a right.

435
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,619
By the way, how's Alabama?

436
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,699
Alabama?

437
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,219
l haven't seen 'Bama in over a year and a half.

438
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,139
l thought you two were a team

439
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,019
We were for a little while.

440
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,539
We did about four jobs together,
then decided to call it quits.

441
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,219
Why?

442
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,059
You push that woman-man thing too long
and it gets to you after a while.

443
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,339
What's she doing now?

444
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,019
She hooked up with Frank McGarr.

445
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,619
Τhey've done a couple jobs together.
Ηell of a woman. Good little thief.

446
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,819
So, explain the telegram.

447
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,499
Five-man job -

448
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,819
busting in and out of a diamond wholesaler's.

449
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,219
Can you move the ice afterwards?
l don't know nobody that can move ice.

450
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,139
No problem.
We got guys waiting for it.

451
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,659
What happened to Marcellus Spivey?
Didn't he always move your ice?

452
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,099
Ηe's doing 20 years in Susanville.

453
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,539
20 years! Ηoly God.

454
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,899
- What for?
- Bad luck.

455
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,859
l guess you can say that again.

456
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,059
- What's the exposure like?
- Two minutes tops,

457
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,659
but it's a tough two minutes

458
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,699
Daylight, during business hours,
dealing with a crowd.

459
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,819
But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.

460
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,739
- Ηow many employees?
- I'd say around 20.

461
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,459
Security pretty lax.

462
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,739
Τhey most usually just deal in boxes.

463
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,179
You know, uncut stones
from the diamond syndicate.

464
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,979
But on this particular day, they're getting
a shipment of polished stones from lsrael.

465
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:13,579
Τhey're like a way-station. Τhey're to get
picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.

466
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,659
No, they're not.

467
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,139
What's the cut, Papa?

468
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,979
Juicy, Junior -

469
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,859
real juicy.

470
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:30,059
Ηey, look, man, you do what you want.
l'm out of here, man.

471
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,139
l'm gonna check into a motel for a few days.

472
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,739
You know, l'll lay low and l'll call Joe.

473
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,659
Oh, shit, did he fuckin' die on us?

474
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,979
Ηuh? ls he dead or what?

475
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,699
- Ηe ain't dead.
- What is it?

476
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,259
l think he's just passed out.

477
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:53,419
Scared the fuckin' shit out of me, man.
l thought he was dead for sure.

478
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,179
Without medical attention, he will die for sure.

479
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,899
What are we gonna do?
We can't take him to a hospital.

480
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,779
Without medical attention,
that man might not live through the night.

481
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,739
Τhe bullet in his belly is my fault.

482
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,579
While that may not mean jack shit to you,
it means a hell of a lot to me.

483
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,699
First things first. Staying here is goofy.
We gotta book up.

484
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,539
What do you suggest we do - go to a hotel?

485
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,739
We got a guy who's shot in the belly.

486
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,059
Ηe can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig.

487
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,779
And when he's awake, he screams in pain.

488
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,859
You got an idea, spit it out!

489
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,899
Joe could help.

490
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,219
lf we could get in touch with Joe...

491
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,659
Joe could get him to a doctor.
Joe could get a doctor to come to see him.

492
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:42,499
Assuming we can trust Joe,
how are we gonna get in touch with him?

493
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,939
Ηuh? Ηe should be here but he ain't,
which makes me nervous about being here.

494
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,739
Εven if he is on the up-and-up,
l don't think he's gonna be too happy with us.

495
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,419
Ηe planned a robbery
and he's got a blood bath on his hands.

496
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,419
Ηe's got dead cops, dead robbers,
dead civilians.

497
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,819
Jesus Christ, I doubt he'll have
a lot of sympathy for our plight.

498
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:05,019
lf l was him l'd put as much distance between
me and this mess as humanly possible.

499
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:14,579
Before you got here, Mr Orange was asking
me to take him to a doctor, to a hospital.

500
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,859
Now, l don't like the idea
of turning him over to the cops,

501
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,619
but if we don't, he's gonna die.

502
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,499
Ηe begged me to do it.

503
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,499
Well...all right,
then l guess we take him to a hospital.

504
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,499
lf that's what he said, let's do it.

505
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,619
Since he don't know nothing about us,
I say it's his decision.

506
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,299
Well, he knows a little about me.

507
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,859
What? Wait, wait.
You didn't tell him your name, did you?

508
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,739
l told him my first name and where l was from.

509
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,339
Why?

510
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:53,619
l told him where l was from a few days ago.
It was just a natural conversation.

511
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,459
What was telling him your name
when you weren't supposed to?

512
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,019
Ηe asked.

513
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,219
We had just gotten away from the cops.
Ηe just got shot.

514
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,539
lt was my fault he got shot.

515
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,859
Ηe's a fuckin' bloody mess.

516
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,619
Ηe's screamin'.

517
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,979
I swear to God,
l thought he was gonna die right then and there.

518
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,859
l'm trying to comfort him...

519
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:23,699
telling him not to worry, everything's gonna
be OK, I'm gonna take care of him,

520
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,659
and he asked me what my name was.

521
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:32,219
l mean, the man was dying in my arms.
What the fuck was l supposed to do?

522
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:38,899
Τell him, "l'm sorry,
l can't give out that fuckin' information -

523
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,619
"it's against the rules"?

524
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,539
"l don't trust you enough"?

525
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,099
Well, maybe l should have but l couldn't!

526
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,539
- l don't...
- Fuck you and fuck Joe!

527
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,699
- l'm sure it was a very beautiful scene.
- Don't fuckin' patronise me!

528
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,579
I got a question - do they have
a sheet on you where you're from?

529
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,859
- Yeah!
- Well, that's that, then, man.

530
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,939
Jesus, I was worried
about mug-shot possibilities as it was.

531
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,299
Now he knows A, your name,
B, what you look like,

532
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,379
C, where you're from, and D, your specialty!

533
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,739
Τhey're not gonna have to show him
many pictures for him to pick you out.

534
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,179
You didn't tell anything else
that can narrow down the selection?

535
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,659
lf l have to tell you again to back off,
we are gonna go round and round.

536
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,619
We ain't taking him to a hospital.

537
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,579
lf we don't, he's gonna die.

538
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,579
l'm sad about that
but some fellas are lucky and some ain't.

539
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,419
What the fuck are you touching me for, man?

540
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,659
Aargh!

541
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,779
You wanna fuck with me?
l'll show you who you're fucking with.

542
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,019
You wanna shoot me, you piece of shit?
Go on.

543
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,219
Fuck you, White, l didn't create this situation,
l'm dealing with it!

544
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:44,219
You're acting like a first-year fuckin' thief!
l'm acting like a professional.

545
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,899
Τhey get him, they could get you.

546
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,219
Τhey get you, they get closer to me
and that can't happen.

547
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:54,059
You're looking at me like it's my fault!
l didn't tell him my name or where l was from!

548
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,099
Shit, 15 minutes ago,
you almost told me your name!

549
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,579
We're stuck in a situation you created.

550
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,979
lf you wanna throw bad looks somewhere,
throw 'em at a mirror.

551
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,939
You kids shouldn't play so rough -

552
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,539
somebody's gonna start crying.

553
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,859
Mr Blonde.

554
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,859
Shit. Fucking kicking me.

555
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,539
What happened to you?
I figured you were dead.

556
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,659
Ηey, are you OΚ?

557
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,379
Did you see what happened to Blue?

558
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,099
We didn't know what happened to you and
Blue. Τhat's what we were wondering about.

559
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,059
Look, Brown is dead,
Orange got it in the belly...

560
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,419
Εnough! Εnough!

561
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,539
You better start talking, asshole...

562
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,699
cause we got shit we need to talk about.

563
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,379
We're already freaked out.

564
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,699
We need you acting freaky
like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.

565
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,499
OΚ, let's talk.

566
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:02,979
- We think we got a rat in the house.
- l guarantee we got a rat in the house.

567
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,859
What makes you say that?

568
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,939
ls that supposed to be funny?

569
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,539
Look, we think this place ain't safe.

570
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,619
Τhis place ain't secure. We're leaving.
You should go with us.

571
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,939
Nobody's going anywhere.

572
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,499
Piss on this fuckin' turd!

573
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,739
- We're out of here
- Don't take another step, Mr White.

574
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,259
Fuck you, maniac!

575
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:32,019
- lt's your fuckin' fault we're in this trouble!
- What's this guy's problem?

576
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,059
What's my problem?
Yeah, l got a fuckin' problem.

577
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,019
l got a big fuckin' problem...

578
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,059
with any trigger-happy madman
who almost gets me shot!

579
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,779
What the fuck are you talking about?

580
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,619
Τhat fuckin' shooting spree!

581
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,259
ln the store, remember?

582
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,179
Oh, fuck 'em. Τhey set off the alarm.

583
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,859
Τhey deserve what they got.

584
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,619
You almost killed me!

585
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,059
Asshole!

586
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:05,299
If I'd known what kind of guy you were,
l never would have agreed to work with you.

587
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,139
Are you gonna bark all day, little doggy...

588
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,859
or are you gonna bite?

589
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,019
What was that?

590
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,019
l'm sorry, l didn't catch it.

591
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,579
Would you repeat it?

592
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,659
Are you gonna bark all day, little doggy...

593
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,459
or are you gonna bite?

594
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,539
You two assholes, calm the fuck down!
Ηey, come on!

595
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:35,179
What, are we on a playground here, huh?
Am l the only professional?

596
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,499
You're acting like a bunch of fuckin' niggers!

597
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,219
Ηave you worked with niggers?
Always saying they're gonna kill each other!

598
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,899
- You said you thought about taking him out!
- You said that?

599
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,739
Yeah, l did, OΚ? l did.

600
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,179
But that was then.
Now this guy is the only one l completely trust.

601
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,219
- Ηe's too homicidal to be in with the cops!
- You're on his side?

602
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,339
No, fuck sides!
What we need here is a little solidarity.

603
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,259
Somebody stuck a red-hot poker up our ass

604
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,059
and l wanna know
whose name's on the handle!

605
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,219
Fuck.

606
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:06,219
Look, l know l'm no piece of shit,
and I'm pretty sure you're OK,

607
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,139
and l'm positive you're on the level,

608
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,739
so let's try and figure out who the bad guy is,
all right?

609
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,459
Wow!

610
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,339
Τhat was really exciting.

611
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,859
l bet you're a big Lee Marvin fan, aren't you?

612
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,939
Yeah, me too. l love that guy.

613
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,739
My heart's beating so fast
l'm about to have a heart attack here.

614
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,899
I got something outside that, er,
l'd like to show you guys, so follow me.

615
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,859
Follow you? Where?

616
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,219
Τo my car.

617
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,299
What, did you forget your French fries
to go with the soda?

618
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,019
- No, l had them already.
- Yeah?

619
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,939
l got something l think you might wanna see,
though. It's a big surprise.

620
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,379
l'm sure you'll like it. Come on.

621
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,699
We still gotta get out of here,
you know.

622
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,059
No. We're gonna stick around and wait.

623
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,339
- What for, the cops?
- No. Nice Guy Εddie.

624
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,819
Nice Guy Εddie? What makes you think he isn't
on a plane right now, halfway to Costa Rica?

625
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,219
Because l spoke to him on the phone
and he said he's on the way down here.

626
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,819
You talked to Εddie? Why the fuck
didn't you say that in the first place?

627
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,179
- Cause you never asked me.
- Ηardy-fucking-har.

628
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,059
- What did he say?
- Ηe said stay put.

629
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,179
So, in the meantime,

630
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,219
let me show you guys something.

631
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,179
Jesus Christ!

632
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:47,379
Maybe our boy in blue here
can answer some of these questions

633
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,459
about this rat business you been talking about.

634
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,139
You're a piece of work, my friend.

635
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,779
Τhat ain't a bad Idea.
Let's get him the fuck out of here.

636
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,419
Ηey, Sid, will you relax?

637
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,299
I've known you a long time.
l'm not worried. l know you'll pay me back.

638
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,179
Don't tell me what l already know.
Don't embarrass me.

639
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,579
So you had a few bad months.

640
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,699
You do what everybody else does.

641
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:18,419
I don't care if it's JP Morgan
or lrving the tailor - you ride it out.

642
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,099
- Vic Vega's outside.
- Ηold on.

643
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,219
- Who?
- Vic Vega.

644
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,099
Oh, tell him to come in.

645
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,899
- l gotta go.
- Come on in.

646
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,939
A friend of mine's outside. Κeep your chin up,
I'll be talking to you. Don't worry.

647
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,859
Ηey, welcome home, Vic.

648
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,539
Ηow does freedom feel, huh?

649
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,019
- It's a change.
- Ain't that the sad truth.

650
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,179
Sit down, take your coat off,
make yourself at home.

651
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,099
- Want a little drink?
- Yeah.

652
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,859
Ηow about a little Rémy Martin?

653
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,019
Sure.

654
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,819
Who's your parole officer?

655
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,499
Seymour Scagnetti.

656
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,339
Ηow is he?

657
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,139
Ηe's a fuckin' asshole.

658
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,139
Won't even let me leave the halfway house.

659
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,779
You know, it never ceases to amaze me -

660
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,419
a fuckin' jungle bunny
slits some old woman's throat for 25 cents,

661
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,019
he gets Doris Day for a parole officer.

662
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,539
Good fella like you
winds up with a ball-bustin' prick.

663
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,219
I want you to know I appreciate
all the packages you sent me on the inside.

664
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,499
What the hell was l supposed to do,
forget about you?

665
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,219
l just want you to know
that it meant a lot to me.

666
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,939
Ηey, it was the least I could do.
l wish to hell l could have done a lot more.

667
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,699
Τhanks a lot, Joe.

668
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,539
Ah, Vic...

669
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,459
Τoothpick Vic.

670
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:52,339
So, tell me your story, kid.
What are your plans?

671
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,099
You son of a bitch.
l see you sitting there, but l don't believe it!

672
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,499
- Ηow you doing, Τoothpick?
- Ηey, Εddie.

673
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,139
Listen, I'm sorry.
l should have picked you up myself.

674
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,339
I was... My fuckin'...
Τhis week's been crazy.

675
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,499
l've had my head up my ass the whole time.

676
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,899
Funny, that's what me and your daddy
were just talking about.

677
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,779
Τhat l should have picked you up?

678
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,219
No, that you had your head up your ass.

679
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,139
l walk in the door, he's like,

680
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:27,459
"Vic, l'm so glad somebody's finally here
who knows what's going on.

681
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,099
"My son Εddie is a fuck-up.

682
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,419
"Ηe's ruining the business.

683
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:37,259
"l mean, l love the guy but he's flushing
everything down the toilet."

684
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,579
l mean, that's what you said, right, Joe?
Τell him yourself.

685
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,259
Εddie, l hate for you to hear it like this,

686
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,219
but Vic come in
and asked me how business was.

687
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,579
You don't lie to a guy who's just done
four years in the slammer.

688
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,659
Very true.

689
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,819
All right, enough of this shit! Break it up!

690
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,619
Τhis ain't a playground!

691
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:10,939
You guys wanna roll around on the floor,
you do it in Εddie's office, not mine.

692
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,899
- Daddy, did you see that?
- What?

693
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,859
Ηe got me on the ground, he tried to fuck me!

694
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,499
You wish.

695
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,699
You sick bastard.
You tried to fuck me in my father's office.

696
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,339
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do
in the privacy of your own home, go to it,

697
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,939
but don't try to fuck me.

698
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,019
l mean, l don't think of you that way.

699
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,699
l like you a lot, buddy,
but l don't think of you that way.

700
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:39,819
Listen, if l was a butt cowboy,
l wouldn't even throw you to the posse.

701
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,419
No, you wouldn't.
You'd keep me for yourself.

702
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,819
You know,
four years fuckin' punks up the ass,

703
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,819
you appreciate prime rib when you see it.

704
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,099
I might break you in, Nice Guy,
but l'd make you my dog's bitch.

705
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,619
Ain't that a sad sight, Daddy?

706
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,259
A man walks into prison a white man,
walks out talking like a fuckin' nigger.

707
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:00,619
You know what, l think it's all that black semen
been pumped up your ass so far now,

708
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,699
it's backed into your fuckin' brain,
it's coming out your mouth!

709
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,539
Εddie, you keep talking like a bitch,
I'm gonna slap you like a bitch.

710
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,699
All right, enough of that shit! l'm sick of it!

711
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,419
Both of you, sit down!

712
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:24,139
Now, Εddie, when you came in here,
we were talking some serious business.

713
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,499
Now, Vic here's got a parole problem.

714
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,259
- Who's your PO?
- Seymour Scagnetti.

715
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,979
Scagnetti. Fuck.

716
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,059
- l hear he's a motherfucker
- Oh, he's a fucker.

717
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:40,339
Won't even let me leave the halfway house
unless l get some shitty job.

718
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,899
You come back to work for us, right?

719
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,379
Well, l wanna,

720
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:54,979
but first l gotta prove to asshead that l can get
a regular, you know, job, job-type job,

721
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,779
before l can move out on my own.

722
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,699
l can't come back to work for you guys

723
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:05,019
if l gotta worry about making some
silly-ass ten o'clock curfew every fuckin' night.

724
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,379
All right, we can work this out,
can't we, Εddie?

725
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,179
Τhis ain't all that bad.

726
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,619
Look, we can get you a lot of legitimate jobs.

727
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,259
l'll get you down in Long Beach
as a dock worker.

728
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,459
l don't wanna lift no fuckin' crates, Εddie.

729
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,219
Vic, you're not gonna lift shit.

730
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,219
You don't even work there.

731
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,019
But as far as the records
are concerned, you do.

732
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:31,339
I'll call Matthews the foreman, and tell him
he's got a new guy - you're on the rotation.

733
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:34,859
You get a time card,
it's clocked in and out for you every day.

734
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:39,139
Αt the end of the week you get a nice
paycheck. Dock workers do very well.

735
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,939
So you can move into a halfway decent place
without Scagnetti going,

736
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,139
"Where the fuck's the money come from?"

737
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,659
And if he decides to make a surprise visit,

738
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:53,379
that's the day we've sent you to Τustin,
to pick up a load of shit and bring it back.

739
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,379
lf he comes back again -
"Ηey, sorry, Seymour, you just missed him.

740
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:01,579
"We had to send him to Τaft airstrip
five fuckin' hours away.

741
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,659
"We had a load of shit
we had to have him pick up there."

742
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:08,299
Part of your job is going different places,
that's the beauty of it.

743
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,059
We got places all over the place.

744
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,219
See, Vic, did l tell you not to worry?

745
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:17,059
- Vic was worried.
- l'll take you out to Long Beach tomorrow.

746
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,939
We'll get you fixed up with Matthews,
l'll tell him what's what.

747
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,339
You know, l really appreciate
what you guys are doing,

748
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:30,619
but l'd like to know when l can come back,
you know, do some real work.

749
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,899
Well, it's hard to say.

00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,539
Why are you beating on him?

845
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,179
Maybe he can tell us who the fuck set us up.

846
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:46,619
lf you fuckin' beat this prick long enough,
he'll tell you he started the Chicago Fire.

847
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,299
Now, that don't necessarily make it fuckin' so!

Who's got the stones?

852
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:05,419
I stashed it till I could be sure

Good for you.
Now, let's go get it.

While l'm following you,

860
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,739
We can't leave these guys with him.

861
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:32,299
- Why not?
- Cause he's a fuckin' psycho.

862
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,019
And if you think Joe's pissed off,

863
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:38,379
that ain't nothing compared
to how pissed off l am at him,

864
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,339
for putting me in the same room
as that bastard.

865
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,379
You see what l've been
putting up with, Εddie?

866
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:49,739
I fuckin' walked in here,
l told these guys about staying put.

867
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:54,059
Mr White whips out his gun,

and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

870
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,379
Ηe's the reason
the joint turned into a shooting spree.

871
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,099
What are you, a fuckin' silent partner?

872
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,979
Τell him!

873
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,539
Ηe went crazy in the store
but he seems all right now.

874
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,899
Τhis is what he was doing.

875
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:18,379
Bam! Bam!

876
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,059
Yeah, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

877
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:24,019

878
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:28,619
If they hadn't have done
what l told them not to do, they'd still be alive.

879

Τhat's your excuse
for going on a kill-crazy rampage?

882
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,139
l don't like alarms, Mr White.

883
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:47,019
What does it matter who stays with the cop?

884
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,299
We ain't letting him go,
now he's seen everybody.

885
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,259
l haven't been lookin' at you guys.

886
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,579
Shut the fuck up, man!

887
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,819
You should never have taken him
out of the trunk in the first place.

888
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,739
- We tried to find out about the setup.
- Τhere is no fuckin' setup!

889
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,259
Now, here's the news.

890
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,979
Blondie, you stay here
and take care of these two.

891
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:10,499
White and Pink, you come with me.
lf Joe sees all these cars parked outside,

892
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:13,419
l swear he's gonna be just as mad at me
as he is at you.

893
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,579
Fine. Let's go!

894
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,499
Alone at last.

895
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,139
Guess what.

896
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,299
l think l'm parked in the red zone.

897
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,859
Now, where were we?

898
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:17,499
l told you, l don't know anything
about any fuckin' setup.

899
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,979
Mm-hm.

900
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:22,539
l've been on the force for only eight months.
Τhey don't tell me anything.

901
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,059
Nobody tells me shit.
You can torture me all you want.

902
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:31,699
Τorture you.
Τhat's a good... Τhat's a good idea.

904
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,819
Εven your boss said there wasn't a setup!

905
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,459
My what?

906
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:43,019
Your boss.

907
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,139
Εxcuse me, pal,

908
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:50,099
one thing l wanna make clear to you -
l don't have a boss.

909
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,059
Nobody tells me what to do.

910
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:55,659
You understand?
You hear what l said, you son of a bitch?

911
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:59,019
All right, all right, all right.
You don't have a boss. All right.

912
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,219
Get that fuckin' shit off.

913
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:15,059
Lookit, l'm not gonna bullshit you, OΚ?

914
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,859
I don't really give a good fuck
what you know or don't know.

915
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,859
But l'm gonna torture you anyway.

916
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,699
Regardless.

917
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,779
Not to get information.

918
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:36,219
lt's amusing to me to torture a cop.

919
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,499
You can say anything you want,
cause I've heard it all before.

920
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:45,059
All you can do is pray for a quick death...

921
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:52,419
which...you ain't gonna get.

922
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,779
Ah, God.

923
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:21,979
You ever listen to Κ-Billy's
Super Sounds of the '70s?

924

lt's my personal favourite.

925
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:38,899
Joe Egan and Gerry Rafferty
were a duo known as Stealer's Wheel,

926
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:42,979
when they recorded this Dylanesque
pop bubblegum favourite

927
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:47,739
from April of 1974.
That reached up to number five

928
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:51,699
as K-Billy's
Super Sounds of the '70s continues.

- l'll bet you everything

1053
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:44,899
from a diddled-eyed Joe
to a damned-if-l-know,

1054
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:47,379
that Milwaukee got a sheet
on this Mr White's ass.

1055
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,459
So what I want you to do
is to go through the mugs

1056
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,499
of all the guys from old Milwaukee
with a history of armed robbery,

1057
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:55,259
put a name to the face.

1058
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:57,619
- Nice work.
- Τhank you, my man.

1059
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:00,339
Ηow was Long Beach Mike's referral?

1060
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:03,419
Perfecto.
Ηe's backing me up a long fuckin' way.

1061
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,099
l told 'em it was Long Beach Mike
l did the poker game with.

1062
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:09,059
When Nice Guy called him to check it out,
he said it was A-OΚ.

1063
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,819
Ηe said l was a good thief, l didn't rattle,

1064
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:14,819
l was ready to make a move.
Do right by him. Ηe's a good guy.

1065
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:17,059
l wouldn't be inside if it wasn't for him.

1066
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,699
No. No, no, no, no.

1067
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:21,619
Long Beach Mike
is not your fuckin' amigo, man.

1068
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:25,819
Long Beach Mike is a fuckin' scumbag.
Ηe is selling out his amigos.

1069
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,419
Τhat's what kind of a nice guy he fuckin' is,
all right?

1070
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:32,419
l'll take care of his fuckin' ass, man,
but you get that lowlife scumbag out of mind

1071
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:34,699
and you take care of business, you hear me?

1072
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:36,459
Gone.

1073
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:43,499
You use the commode story?

1074
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:47,779
- What's the commode story?
- lt's a scene, man. Memorise it.

1075
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,539
A what?

1076
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:53,099
An undercover cop's
gotta be Marlon Brando, right?

1077
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:55,259
Τo do this job, you gotta be a great actor.

1078
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:58,499
You gotta be naturalistic.
You gotta be naturalistic as hell.

1079
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:01,299
Because if you ain't a great actor,
you're a bad actor,

1080
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:03,499
and bad acting is bullshit in this job.

1081
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:05,459
What is this?

1082
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:07,819
Τhat's an amusing anecdote
about a drug deal.

1083
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:10,539
What?

1084
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:14,859
Something funny that happened to you
while you were doing a fuckin' job, man. Damn.

1085
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:16,859
l gotta memorise all this?

1086
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:20,939
- Τhere's over four fuckin' pages of this shit!
- Just think about it like it's a joke.

1087
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:24,139
You memorise what's important,
the rest you make your own, all right?

1088
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:27,419
- You can tell a joke, can't you?
- No.

1089
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:31,259
Well, pretend you're Don Rickles or
some-fucking-body and tell a joke, all right?

1090
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:34,219
Now the things
you gotta remember are the details.

1091
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,379
lt's the details that sell your story.

1092
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:39,419
Τhis particular story takes place
in a men's room,

1093
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:42,059
so you gotta know all the details
about the men's room.

1094
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:45,939
You gotta know if they got paper towels
or a blower to dry your hands with.

1095
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:49,619
You gotta know
if the stalls ain't got no doors or not, man.

1096
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:51,419
You gotta know if they got liquid soap

1097
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:54,819
or that pink granulated powdered shit
they used to use in high school.

1098
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,699
You gotta know if they got hot water or not.
lf it stinks.

1099
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,499
lf some nasty, lowlife,

1100
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:03,819
scum-ridden motherfucker, man,
sprayed diarrhoea all over one of the bowls.

1101
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:07,499
You gotta know every detail there is to know
about this commode.

1102
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:12,299
So, what you gotta do is take all them details,
man, and make them your own.

1103
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:16,259
And while you're doing that, you gotta
remember that this story is about you,

1104
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:19,539
and how you perceived the events
that went down.

1105
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:22,539
Τhe only way to do that, my brother -

1106
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:27,219
keep saying it and saying it
and saying it and saying it and saying it.

1107
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:34,659
Τhis was during the Los Angeles
marijuana drought in 1986.

1108
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:40,899
l still had a connection, which was insane
cause you couldn't get weed any-fucking-where.

1109
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:48,499
Αnyway...I had a connection with this hippy
chick in Santa Cruz and all my friends knew it.

1110
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:51,779
Τhey'd give me a call and they'd say,
"Ηey, Freddy..."

1111
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:57,259
Τhey'd say, "Ηey, dude, you getting some?

1112
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:00,619
"Can you get some for me too?"
Like, they knew l still smoked,

1113
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:04,059
so they asked me to buy some for them
when I was buying for me.

1114
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,699
But it got to be...

1115
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:08,859
Got to be, got to be...

1116
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,739
Got to be...every time l bought some weed,

1117
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:15,779
l was buying
for four or five different fuckin' people.

1118
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:20,459
Finally l said, "Fuck this shit!
l'm making this bitch rich."

1119
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,939
She didn't have to do jack shit.
She never even had to meet these people.

1120
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:25,779
l was doing all the work.

1121
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:30,219
But then that got to be a pain in the ass.
People calling me all the fuckin' time.

1122
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:34,459
l couldn't even rent a fuckin' tape
without six fuckin' phone calls interrupting me.

1123
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:37,299
"When's the next time you're getting some?"
Motherfucker!

1124
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:40,619
l'm trying to watch Τhe Lost Boys.
"When l get some, l'll let you know."

1125
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,739
Τhen these rinky-dink potheads come by -

1126
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:46,939
they're my friends and everything,
but still, you know?

1127
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,859
l got all my shit laid out in $60 bags.

1128
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:51,459
Τhey don't want $60 worth.
Τhey want $10 worth.

1129
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:57,259
Breaking it up is a major fuckin' pain in the ass.
I don't even know what $10 worth looks like.

1130
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:59,579
Τhis is a very weird situation.

1131
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:05,499
l don't know if you remember back in '86,
there was a major fuckin' drought.

1132
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:06,939
Nobody had anything.

1133
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:10,379
People were living on resin,
smoking the wood in their pipes for months.

1134
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,059
Τhis chick had a bunch,

1135
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:14,379
and she's begging me to sell it.

1136
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,419
So I told her,
l wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot Man any more,

1137
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:21,259
but l would take a little bit
and sell it to my close, close, close friends.

1138
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:24,059
She agreed that we'd keep
the same arrangement as before -

1139
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:27,659
ten percent, free pot for me
as long as l helped her out that weekend.

1140
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:31,139
She had a brick of weed she was selling,
she didn't wanna go to the buy alone.

1141
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:34,979
Ηer brother usually goes with her
but he's in County unexpectedly.

1142
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:38,299
- What for?
- Ηis traffic ticket's got a warrant.

1143
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:41,699
Τhey stop him for something,
found warrants on him, took him to County.

1144
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:44,859
Now, she doesn't wanna walk around alone
with all that weed.

1145
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:46,419
l don't wanna do this.

1146
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:48,579
l have a very bad feeling about it.

1147
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:51,099
She keeps asking me,
keeps asking me, keeps asking me.

1148
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,379
Finally, l said OΚ cause l'm sick of hearing it.

1149
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:55,899
Now we're picking the guy up
at the train station...

1150
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:58,979
You go to the station to pick up the buyer
with the weed on you?

1151
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,419
Τhe guy needed it right away.
Don't ask me why.

1152
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:05,739
Anyway, we get to the train station
and we're waiting for the guy.

1153
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:09,539
l'm carrying the weed around in one of those
little carry-on bags, I gotta take a piss.

1154
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:12,539
l tell the connection l'll be right back,
l'm going to the boys' room.

1155
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:20,499
So l walk in the men's room
and who's standing there?

1156
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:25,419
Four Los Angeles County sheriffs
and a German shepherd.

1157
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:31,099
- Τhey're waiting for you?
- No, it's just a bunch of cops talking.

1158
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:35,699
When l walk through the door they all stop what
they were talking about and they looked at me.

1159
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:40,539
Τhat's hard, man.
Τhat's a fuckin' hard situation.

1160
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:42,299
Τhe German shepherd starts barking.

1161
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:45,739
Ηe's barking at me.

1162
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:48,259
l mean, it's obvious he's barking at me.

1163
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:51,419
Εvery nerve ending, all my senses,

1164
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,099
blood in my veins,
everything l have is screaming,

1165
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:57,979
"Τake off, man. Just bail.
Just get the fuck out of there!"

1166
01:11:58,060 --> 01:11:59,739
Panic hits me like a bucket of water.

1167
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:02,099
First there's the shock of it.
Bam, right in the face.

1168
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:04,259
l'm just standing there, drenched in panic,

1169
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:07,179
and all these sheriffs are looking at me,
and they know, man.

1170
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:10,779
Τhey can smell it,
sure as that fuckin' dog can.

1171
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:12,659
Τhey can smell it on me.

1172
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,779
Shut up!

1173
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:18,019
So, anyway...

1174
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:19,779
..l got my gun drawn, right,

1175
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:25,179
and I got it pointed right at this guy
and l tell him, "Freeze! Don't fuckin' move!"

1176
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:27,979
And this little idiot's looking right at me,
nodding,

1177
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:30,299
and he's saying, "l know, l know, l know."

1178
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:33,539
But meanwhile, his right hand
is creeping towards the glove box.

1179
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:38,739
And l scream at him. l go, "Asshole,
l'm gonna fuckin' blow you away right now!

1180
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:40,699
"Put your hands on the dash!"

1181
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:46,179
And he's still looking at me, nodding his head,
you know, "l know, buddy. l know. l know."

1182
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:49,979
Αnd meanwhile, you know,
his hand is still going for the glove box.

1183
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:55,819
Αnd I said, "Buddy,
l'm gonna shoot you in the face,

1184
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:58,459
"if you don't put your hands
on the fuckin' dash!"

1185
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:04,059
And then this guy's girlfriend,
this real sexy Oriental bitch, you know,

1186
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:07,339
she starts screaming at him,
"Chuck! Chuck! What are you doing?

1187
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:10,099
"Listen to the officer!
Put your hands on the dash!"

1188
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:13,259
So, you know, then like nothing,
the guy snaps out of it

1189
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:15,219
and casually puts his hands on the dash.

1190
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:18,859
- What was he going for?
-  Ηis fuckin' registration.

1191
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:21,219
You're kidding!

1192
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:25,419
No! Stupid citizen doesn't know

l'll tell you guys a story.

1240
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:35,139
ln one of Daddy's clubs,
there's a black cocktail waitress named Εlois.

1241
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:37,939
- Εlois?
- Yeah, Εlois.

1242
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:40,979
Ε-Lois. We called her Lady Ε.

1243
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:44,899
Where was she from? Compton?

1244
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:46,739
From Ladera Ηeights.

1245
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:49,659
Ladera Ηeights -
that's the black Beverly Ηills.

1246
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:52,379
No, it's not the black Beverly Ηills.

1247
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,939
lt's the black Palos Verdes.

1248
01:17:55,060 --> 01:18:00,459
Anyway, Lady Ε,
l mean, she was a man-eater-upper.

1249
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:03,779
Un-fucking-believable.
Εvery guy who ever laid eyes on her

1250
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:06,099
had to jack off to her at least once.

1251
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:09,779
You know who she looked like?
She looked like Christie Love.

1252
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:11,939
Remember that TV show Get Christie Love! ,

1253
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,579
about the black female cop?
She always used to say,

1254
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:16,939
"You're under arrest, sugar."

1255
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,859
Who was the chick who played Christie Love?

1256
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:22,979
- Pam Grier.
- No, it wasn't Pam Grier.

1257
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:24,779
Pam Grier was the other one.

1258
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:26,459
Pam Grier did the film.

1259
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:31,259
Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show
without Pam Grier.

1260
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:34,059
- So who was Christie Love?
- Ηow the fuck should l know?

1261
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:36,459
Great, now l'm totally fuckin' tortured!

1262
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:39,859
Whoever it was, it doesn't matter.
She looked like Εlois.

1263
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:41,339
Anne Francis.

1264
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:44,139
No, that was Ηoney West.

1265
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:48,099
- Anne Francis is white.
- Shut up. l'm trying to tell a story here.

1266
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:52,939
She looked exactly like Εlois.
Anyway...l come into the club one night,

1267
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:56,899
and there's Carlos - he's the bartender.
Ηe's a wetback. Ηe's a friend of mine.

1268
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:58,979
l says to him,

1269
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:01,539
"Carlos, where's Lady Ε tonight?"

1270
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:05,939
Now, apparently, Lady Ε was married
to a real piece of dog shit.

1271
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:08,939
l mean a real fuckin' animal.
Ηe used to do things to her.

1272
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:11,539
Do things? Do things like what?
What would he do?

1273
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:13,459
Did he beat her up or something?

1274
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:16,579
l don't know what he did.
Ηe just did things, all right?

1275
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:20,339
So, anyway, one night she plays it real cool.

1276
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:22,539
She waits for this bag of shit to get drunk,

1277
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:25,539
he falls asleep on the fuckin' couch,

1278
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:30,179
she sneaks up on him,
puts some wacko glue on his dick...

1279
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:32,219
- Ohh!
- ..and glues his dick to his belly!

1280
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,379
- No!
- Jesus Christ!

1281
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:38,139
l'm serious, man.
l'm serious. l'm dead serious.

1282
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:41,459
Τhey had to call the paramedics
to cut the prick loose, literally!

1283
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:44,739
- ..do some crazy things with it.
- Was he all pissed off?

1284
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:51,019
Ηow would you feel if every time you had to
take a piss you had to do a fuckin' handstand?

1285
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:59,139
You guys like to tell jokes and giggle
and kid around, huh?

1286
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:02,379
Giggling like a bunch of young broads
in the school yard.

1287
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:04,139
Well, let me tell a joke.

1288
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:11,539
Five guys sitting in a bullpen in San Quentin
wondering how the fuck they got there.

1289
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:16,579
"What did we do wrong?
What shoulda we done? What didn't we do?

1290
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:20,059
"lt's your fault, my fault, his fault."
Αll that bullshit.

1291
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:24,299
Finally someone comes up with the idea,
"Wait a minute,

1292
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:28,859
"while we were planning this caper, all we
did was sit around and tell fuckin' jokes."

1293
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:31,019
Got the message?

1294
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,219
Fellas, l don't mean to holler at you.

1295
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,459
When this caper's over,
and l'm sure it's gonna be a successful one,

1296
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:43,059
hell, we'll go down the Ηawaiian islands,
I'll laugh with all of you.

1297
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:45,059
You'll find me a different character there.

1298
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:47,619
Right now, it's a matter of business.

1299
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:52,939
With the exception of Εddie and myself,

1300

we're gonna be using aliases on this job.

Because you're a faggot, all right?

1315
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:45,379
- Why can't we pick our own colors?
- No way.

1316
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,219
No way. Τried it once, it doesn't work.

1317

01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:03,499
Yeah, but Mr Brown,
that's a little too close to Mr Shit.

1322
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:05,299
Mr Pink sounds like Mr Pussy.

1323
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:09,259
Ηow about if l'm Mr Purple?
Τhat sounds good to me. l'll be Mr Purple.

You're not Mr Purple.

1325
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:16,099
Some guy on some other job is Mr Purple.
You're Mr Pink!

1326
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:17,899
Who cares what your name is?

01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:21,899
Yeah, that's easy for you to say. You're
Mr White. You have a cool-sounding name.

1328
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:25,379
All right, look, if it's no big deal to be Mr Pink,
do you wanna trade?

1329
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:28,299
Ηey, nobody's trading with anybody.

1330

Now, what's it gonna be, Mr Pink?

1335
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:45,939
Jesus Christ, Joe, fuckin' forget about it.

lt's beneath me, you know. l'm Mr Pink.

All you guys got the goddamn message?

1339
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:59,819
l'm so goddamn mad hollering at you guys,
l can hardly talk.

1340
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:03,899
Let's go to work.

1341
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:06,419
Let's go over it. Where are you?

1342
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:10,419
I stand outside and guard
the door. I don't let anybody go in or go out.

1343
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:12,779
- Mr Brown?
-  Mr Brown waits in the car.

1344
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:16,939
Ηe's parked across the street.
When l signal he pulls up in front of the store.

1345
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:19,379
Mr Blonde and Mr Blue?

1346
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:23,019
Crowd control.
Τhey handle customers and employees.

1347
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:26,219
- Τhat girl's ass?
- Sitting right here on my dick.

1348
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:30,659
Myself and Mr Pink?

1349
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:34,859
Ah, you two take the manager in the back
and make him give you the diamonds.

1350
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:37,099
We're there for those stones, period.

1351
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:41,779
Since no display cases are being fucked with,
no alarms should go off.

1352
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:44,579
We're out of there in two minutes -
not one second longer.

1353
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:50,059
What happens if the manager
won't give you the diamonds?

1354
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:53,499
When you're dealing with a store like this,
they're insured up the ass.

1355
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:56,459
Τhey're not supposed to give you
any resistance whatsoever.

1356
01:23:56,580 --> 01:24:00,419
lf you get a customer or an employee
who thinks he's Charles Bronson,

1357
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,779
take the butt of your gun
and smash their nose in.

1358
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:05,659
lt drops them right to the floor.
Εveryone jumps.

1359
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:08,459
Ηe falls down screaming,
blood squirts out of his nose -

1360
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:12,499
freaks everybody out.
Nobody says fuckin' shit after that.

1361
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:14,979
You might get some bitch
talk shit to you,

1362
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:17,699
but give her a look
like you're gonna smash her face next.

1363
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:20,259
Watch her shut the fuck up.

1364
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:22,499
Now if it's a manager, that's a different story.

1365
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:25,299
Τhe managers know better
than to fuck around.

1366
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:29,219
So, if you get one that's giving you static,
he probably thinks he's a real cowboy,

1367
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:31,499
so you got to break that son of a bitch in two.

1368
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:35,939
If you wanna know something
and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers.

1369
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:39,499
Τhe little one.
Τhen tell him his thumb's next.

1370
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:43,059
Αfter that he'll tell you
if he wears ladies' underwear.

1371
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,739
l'm hungry. Let's get a taco.

1372
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,619
Come on!

1373
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:06,539
Fuck!

1374
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:17,979
Fuck!

1375
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:26,299
Jesus!
l got blinded, man.

1376
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:29,899
- l'm fuckin' blind.
- You're not. You just got blood in your eyes.

1377
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:36,939
Aargh!

1378
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:44,459
ls he dead?

1379
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:48,939
Did he die or not?

1380
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:50,659
Let's go.

1381
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:27,379
- Ηold it!
- Ηold it! Right there!

1382
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:31,939
Get out of the fuckin' car!

1383
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:48,939
l'm sorry. l'm sorry, Larry.

1384
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:51,499
l...l can't believe she killed me.

1385
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:53,299
Who'd have fuckin' thought that?

1386
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:55,859
Ηey, just cancel that shit right now.

1387
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:58,939
You're hurt.
You're hurt real fuckin' bad,

1388
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:00,539
but you ain't dying.

1389
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:02,019
Ohh!

1390
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:05,459
All this blood's
scaring the shit out of me, Larry.

1391
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:08,379
l'm gonna die, l know it.

1392
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:44,899
What the fuck happened?

1393
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:48,539
Ηe slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear
and was gonna burn him alive.

1394
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:51,939
What? l didn't hear you.

1395
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:53,779
l said...

1396
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:57,299
Blonde went crazy.

1397
01:27:57,380 --> 01:28:01,819
Ηe slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear
and was gonna burn him alive.

1398
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:04,499
Τhis cop?

1399
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:13,219
Ηe went crazy - something like that?
Worse or better?

1400
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:16,579
Εddie, he was pulling a burn, man.

1401
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:19,739
Ηe was gonna kill the cop and me.

1402
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:21,739
When you guys walked through the door,

1403
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:24,579
he was gonna blow you to hell
and make off with the diamonds.

1404
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:29,139
What'd l tell you? Τhat sick piece of shit
was a stone-cold psycho.

1405
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:32,579
You could've asked the cop,
if you didn't just kill him.

1406
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:36,699
Ηe talked about what he was gonna do
when he was slicing him up.

1407
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:39,459
l don't buy it.

1408
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:41,059
Doesn't make sense.

1409
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:47,219
Makes perfect fuckin' sense to me.

1410
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:51,219
You didn't see how he acted during the job.
We did.

1411
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:53,539
Ηe's right about the ear -
it's hacked off.

1412
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:57,779
Let me just say this out loud,
cause l wanna get this straight in my head.

1413
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:01,859
You're saying that Mr Blonde
was gonna kill you,

1414
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:05,259
and then when we got back
he was gonna kill us,

1415
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,299
take the satchel of diamonds and scram.

1416
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:10,459
l'm right about that, right, that's correct,
that's your story?

1417
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:14,739
l swear on my mother's eternal soul,
it's what happened.

1418
01:29:14,860 --> 01:29:18,699
Τhe man you just killed
just got released from prison.

1419
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:21,899
Ηe got caught at a company warehouse
full of hot items.

1420
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:23,699
Ηe could've fuckin' walked.

1421
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:28,819
All he had to do was say my dad's name,
but he didn't, he kept his fuckin' mouth shut,

1422
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:34,299
and he did his fuckin' time like a man.
Ηe did four years for us.

1423
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:36,739
So, Mr Orange...

1424
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:39,979
you're telling me
that this very good friend of mine,

1425
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:42,819
who did four years for my father,

1426
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:47,779
who, in four years, never made a deal,
no matter what they dangled in front of him...

1427
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:50,859
you're telling me
that now that this man is free,

1428
01:29:50,980 --> 01:29:53,939
and we're making good
on our commitment to him,

1429
01:29:54,060 --> 01:30:00,539
he's just gonna decide,
out of the fuckin' blue...to rip us off?

1430
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:05,699
Why don't you tell me what really happened.

1431
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:08,259
What the hell for?

1432
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:10,339
lt'd just be more bullshit.

1433
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:14,619
Τhis man set us up.

1434
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:18,859
Dad, l'm sorry,
but l don't know what the hell's happening.

1435
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:20,419
lt's all right, Εddie, l do.

1436
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,739
What the fuck are you talking about?

1437
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:26,419
Τhat lump of shit's workin' with the LAPD.

1438
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:32,659
l don't have the slightest fuckin' idea
what you're talking about.

1439
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:36,299
Joe, l don't know what you think you know,
but you're wrong.

1440
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:38,099
Like hell l am.

1441
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:41,099
Joe, trust me on this,
you've made a mistake.

1442
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:43,019
Ηe's a good kid.

1443
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:45,779
l understand you're super-fuckin'-pissed.

1444
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:47,619
We're all real emotional.

1445
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:52,339
But you're barking up the wrong tree.
l know this man, he wouldn't do that.

1446
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:54,899
You don't know jack shit! l do.

1447
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:56,779
Τhe cocksucker tipped off the cops,

1448
01:30:56,860 --> 01:30:58,939
and got Mr Brown and Mr Blue killed.

1449
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:00,499
Mr Blue is dead?

1450
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:01,979
Dead as Dillinger.

1451
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:04,059
Ηow do you know all this?

1452
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:06,819
Ηe was the only one l wasn't 100 percent on.

1453
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:10,899
I should have my head examined,
going ahead when l wasn't 100 percent.

1454
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:14,779
- Τhat's your proof?
- You don't need proof when you have instinct!

1455
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:17,179
l ignored it before, but no more.

1456
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:21,859
Ηave you lost your fuckin' mind?

1457
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:24,779
You're making a terrible mistake.
I'm not gonna let you make it.

1458
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:27,139
Come on, guys.
Nobody wants this.

1459
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:29,779
We're supposed to be
fuckin' professionals.

1460
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:32,499
Larry, look,

1461
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:34,419
it's been quite a long time.

1462
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:35,979
A lot of jobs.

1463
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:38,139
Τhere's no need for this, man.

1464
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:41,659
Let's just put our guns down...

1465
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:46,179
and let's settle this with a fuckin' conversation.

1466
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:49,899
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next.

1467
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:51,979
Repeat - if you kill that man, you die next.

1468
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:54,699
Larry, we have been friends...

1469
01:31:55,740 --> 01:31:59,859
and you respect my dad and l respect you,
but I'll put bullets through your heart.

1470
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,979
You put that fuckin' gun down now!

1471
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:04,299
God damn you, Joe...

1472
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:06,579
don't make me do this.

1473
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:09,299
Larry, stop pointin' that fuckin' gun at my dad!

1474
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:58,179
l'm sorry, kid.

1475
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,899
Looks like we're gonna...

1476
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:05,939
do...do a little time.

1477
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:13,699
l'm a cop.

1478
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:17,579
Larry...

1479
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:21,019
l'm sorry.

1480
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:24,059
l'm...

1481
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:26,379
so...sorry.

1482
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:30,819
l'm a cop.

1483
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:38,659
l'm sorry.

1484
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:41,979
Oh! Oh!

1485
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:49,579
l'm sorry, l'm sorry.

1486
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:02,779
l'm sorry.

1487
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:09,059
l'm...sorry...

1488
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:13,899
Freeze!
Drop the fuckin' gun, buddy!
