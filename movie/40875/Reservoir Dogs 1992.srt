2
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,900
让我告诉你"宛若处女"说的是什么
Let me tell you what "Like A Virgin" is about.

3
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,280
是说一个姑娘找到一个大老二的男人
It's all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick.

4
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:27,430
后期：Lee.要好好找工作！

5
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,460
整首歌就是暗指大老二
The entire song is a metaphor for big dicks.

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,940
不  不是的
No it ain't.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,240
是说一个非常敏感的妞
It's about a girl who's very vulnerable.

8
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,950
她有过几次性经验
She's been fucked over a few times

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,620
然后遇上一个敏感的男人
and she meets a guy who's sensitive.

10
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,990
歇歇吧  这些废话拿去唬弄游客好了
Whoa. Timeout. Tell that bullshit to the tourists.

11
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,180
塔比  谁是他妈的塔比  
Toby? Who the fuck is Toby?

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,560
"宛若处女"不是说什么
"Like A Virgin" is not about some

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,950
一个敏感的姑娘遇见一个好小伙子
sensitive girl who meets a nice fella.

14
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,570
那是"绝对忧郁"说的故事
That's what "True Blue" is about. No argument about that.

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,520
哪首歌是"绝对忧郁"  
Which one is "True Blue"?

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,560
是麦当娜的一首热门上榜歌曲
It was a big-ass hit for Madonna.

17
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,310
我从不关心什么狗屁排行榜
I don't even follow that top-of-the-pops shit

18
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,050
但我听过这首歌
and I've heard of "True Blue."

19
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,480
我不会说我没听过
I didn't say I ain't heard of it.

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,890
我只想知道它讲了什么
All I asked is how's it go?

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,380
很抱歉我不是世上最爱麦当娜的歌迷
Excuse me for not being the world's biggest Madonna fan.

22
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,880
没有她我也能活下去
Personally I can do without her.

23
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,030
我曾经喜欢她早期的歌"边缘"...
I used to like her early stuff "Borderline"...

24
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,580
但从她唱了那首"爸爸  不要说教"之后
but once she got off with that "Papa Don't Preach" phase

25
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,110
我就不喜欢了
I tuned out.

26
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,010
嘿  你们这些家伙打断了我的思路
Hey you guys are making me lose my train of thought here.

27
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,170
我刚才讲到哪了  
I was sayin' something. What was it?

28
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,600
哦  那个中国小姑娘塔比
Oh Toby's that little Chinese girl.

29
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,300
-她姓什么来着  -那是什么  
-What was her last name? -What's that?

30
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,640
是我在一件旧外套里
It's an old address book I found in a coat

31
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,910
找到的一本旧地址簿
I haven't worn in a coon's age.

32
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,060
-那名字是什么  -我他妈的在讲什么来着  
-What was that name? -What the fuck was I talkin' about?

33
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,260
你说"绝对忧郁"讲一个...
You said "True Blue" was about a guy...

34
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,640
一个敏感的妞遇上一个棒小伙...
a sensitive girl who meets a nice guy...

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,310
但"宛若处女"是个暗指大老二的故事
but "Like A Virgin" was a metaphor for big dicks.

36
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,640
让我告诉你"宛若处女"是讲什么
Let me tell you what "Like A Virgin" is about.

37
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,640
它讲的是一个职业性交机器的经历
It's all about this cooze who's a regular fuck machine.

38
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,090
我是指早上  白天  晚上  下午...
I'm talkin' morning day night afternoon...

39
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,010
老二  老二...
dick dick dick dick dick dick dick dick dick!

40
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,240
-有多少个"老二"  -很多
-How many "dicks" is that? -A lot.

41
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,700
然后有一天  她遇见约翰・荷莫斯那个混蛋
Then one day she meets this John Holmes motherfucker.

42
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,540
一个大惊喜
It's like "Whoa baby."

43
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,380
那混蛋就像"大逃亡"里的主角
He's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape."

44
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,090
他插进"隧道"  现在她见识了真正的老二
He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' serious dick action.

45
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,410
她体会到久违的感觉  痛  痛
She's feelin' somethin' she ain't felt since forever: pain pain.

46
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,100
朱  塔比・朱  
Chew? Toby Chew?

47
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,470
她被弄伤了
It hurts. It hurts her.

48
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,020
她不应该痛  她的私处本该是充满快感的
It shouldn't hurt her. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now.

49
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,750
但那家伙干她时  就是痛
But when this cat fucks her it hurts.

50
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,980
痛得就像是第一次一样
It hurts just like it did the first time.

51
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,690
疼痛让这个性交机器记起了...
You see the pain is reminding a fuck machine...

52
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,840
还是处女时的那次感觉
what it was once like to be a virgin.

53
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,780
因此  叫"宛若处女"
Hence "Like A Virgin."

54
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,380
王
Wang.

55
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,770
-把那该死的东西给我  -你以为你是谁  
-Give me that fuckin' thing. -What in hell do you think you're doin'?

56
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,860
我讨厌听你说这个  乔  我会在走的时候还给你
I'm sick of hearin' it Joe. I'll give it back to you when we leave.

57
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,440
什么意思  走的时候  马上还给我
What do you mean when we leave? Give me it back now!

58
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,530
过去十五分钟你都在念叨这些名字
For the past 15 minutes now you've been droning on about names.

59
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,400
塔比  塔比  
"Toby. Toby?

60
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,740
塔比  塔比・王
Toby? Toby Wong.

61
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,970
塔比・王  塔比・王
Toby Wong? Toby Wong.

62
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,010
塔比・张  去他妈的查理・陈
Toby Chung fuckin' Charlie Chan."

63
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,550
我左耳朵听到的是麦当娜的大老二
I've got Madonna's big dick comin' out of my left ear...

64
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,270
而塔比那个日本...不管是什么人  
and Toby the Jap...I don't know what...

65
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,590
却出现在我的右耳朵
comin' out of my right.

66
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,130
把本子给我
Give me that book.

67
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,110
你会把它放在一边吗  
Are you gonna put it away?

68
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,810
我想他妈的干什么就干什么
I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I want with it.

69
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,270
那我恐怕只好继续保管它
Well then I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.

70
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,260
嘿  乔  要我开枪崩了这家伙吗  
Hey Joe want me to shoot this guy?

71
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,180
妈的
Shit.

72
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,480
你做梦对我开过枪  醒来后最好向我道歉
You shoot me in a dream you better wake up and apologize.

73
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,830
你们听过
You guys been listenin'

74
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,520
K・比利做的"70年代超级声"吗  
to K-BILLY's "Super Sounds of the '70s" weekend?

75
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,360
听过  节目非常棒
Yeah. That's fuckin' great.

76
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,820
你相信他们在歌里唱的吗  
You believe the songs they're playin'?

77
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,280
知道我那时候听什么  
Know what I heard the other day?

78
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,820
东尼・迪弗朗科和家人唱的
"Heartbeat It's a Lovebeat"

79
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,350
"心跳  是爱的悸动"
by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco family.

80
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,000
我到十五年级之后就再没听过
I haven't heard that song since I was in the fifth fuckin' grade.

81
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,870
我到这时
When I was comin'down here

82
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,710
"乔治亚黑夜"刚问世
"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on.

83
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,660
这首歌流行起来后我就没听过了
I ain't heard that song since it was big.

84
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,320
但它流行的时候
But when it was big

85
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,940
我肯定听过无数次
I must've heard it a million-trillion fuckin' times.

86
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,950
那是我第一次了解到...
But this is the first time I ever realized...

87
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,820
那姑娘唱的那首歌  就是枪杀安迪的那首
that the girl singin' the song is the one who shot Andy.

88
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,480
你不知道  是维奇・罗伦斯枪杀了安迪  
You didn't know that Vickie Lawrence was the one who shot Andy?

89
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,530
我以为是个不忠的妻子枪杀了安迪
I thought the cheatin' wife shot Andy.

90
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,520
他们说那是那首歌的结尾
They say that at the end of the song.

91
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,000
我知道  混蛋  我听说是这样  所以才这么说
I know motherfucker.I just heard it.That's what I'm talkin' about.

92
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,450
我以前肯定是漏听了那部分
I must've zoned out during that part before.

93
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,310
好了  我来付帐
All right I'll take care of the check.

94
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,700
你们自己付小费
You guys can get the tip.

95
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,120
每人一块钱
Should be about a buck apiece.

96
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,470
你  我回来时把本子还给我
And you when I come back I want my book.

97
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,910
对不起  现在它是我的
Sorry. It's my book now.

98
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,110
嘿  我改主意了  毙了这混蛋好吗  
Hey I changed my mind. Shoot this piece of shit will ya?

99
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,160
好了  每人掏一块钱给那位年轻女士
All right everybody cough up some green for the little lady.

100
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,210
快  就一块钱
Come on throw in a buck.

101
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,960
我不付小费
I don't tip.

102
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,740
-你不付小费  -我不赞成这个
-You don't tip? -I don't believe in it.

103
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,990
你不赞成付小费  
You don't believe in tipping?

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,330
你知道这些姑娘能挣多少吗  少得可怜
Do you know what these chicks make? They make shit.

105
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,050
她挣不到足够的钱就会辞职不干
If she don't make enough money she can quit.

106
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,880
我从不知道  一个该死的犹太人会这么说
I don't even know a fuckin' Jew who'd have the balls to say that.

107
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,690
别怪我这么直接  你从不付小费吗  
Let me get this straight. You don't ever tip huh?

108
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,090
我不给小费是因为社会说我必须给
I don't tip because society says I have to.

109
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,010
如果她们真的尽力工作了  我会给她们额外的报酬
If they really put forth the effort I'll give 'em somethin' extra.

110
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,590
而现在是主动给她们小费
But this tipping automatically it's for the birds.

111
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,350
我觉得她们只是尽了自己的本份
As far as I'm concerned they're just doin' their job.

112
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,270
-这姑娘不错  -她没问题
-This girl was nice. -She was okay.

113
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,690
-但也没什么特别  -怎样算特别  
-She wasn't anything special. -What's special?

114
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,370
带你回家然后舔你的老二  
Take you in the back and suck your dick?

115
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,970
那我愿意为此多给12%
I'd go over 12% for that.

116
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,970
我叫了咖啡对吗  她只给我添了三次
I ordered coffee all right? She's only filled my cup three times.

117
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,950
我想要六次
I want it filled six times.

118
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,310
六次  如果她太忙呢  
Six times? Well what if she's too fuckin' busy?

119
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,910
侍应生的字典里
The words"too fuckin' busy"

120
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,510
不该有"太忙"这个词
shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.

121
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,230
抱歉  粉先生  你无非就是想要...
Excuse me Mr. Pink but the last fuckin' thing you need's...

122
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,650
另一杯咖啡
another cup of coffee.

123
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:44,250
这些侍应不会饿死  她们有最低收入保障
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage.

124
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,340
我也拿过低保  可那时...
I used to work minimum wage and when I did...

125
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,860
我并没幸运到有人认为
I wasn't lucky enough to have a job

126
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,320
值得付小费
that society deemed tip-worthy.

127
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,450
你不在乎她们是靠你的小费维生  
You don't care they're countin' on your tips to live?

128
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,890
知道这是什么意思吗  
You know what this is?

129
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,790
这是世上最小的小提琴  只为侍应生演奏
The world's smallest violin playin' just for the waitresses.

130
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,250
你一点也不知道你在说的是什么
You don't have any idea what you're talkin' about.

131
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,690
这些人忙得不可开交  这是份辛苦的工作
These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.

132
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,120
在麦当劳工作也一样  但你不会觉得该付她们小费
So's working at McDonald's but you don't feel the need to tip them.

133
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,680
她们为你服务  但是社会说  
They're servin' you food but society says...

134
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,580
"别给那些人小费  但要给这些人"  全是胡说
"Don't tip these guys over here but tip these guys." That's bullshit.

135
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,780
侍应生是这个国家...
Waitressing is the number-one occupation...

136
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,540
没受过大学教育的女性的首选职业
for female non-college graduates in this country.

137
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,660
这份工作关键在于  任何女人都能胜任并赖以谋生
It's the one job basically any woman can get and make a living on.

138
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,580
原因就在于她们的小费
The reason is because of their tips.

139
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,300
去他妈的
Fuck all that.

140
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,810
很遗憾政府要对她们的小费征税
I'm very sorry the government taxes their tips.

141
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,140
真是糟透了  但那不是我的错
That's fucked up. That ain't my fault.

142
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,290
这说明侍应生是众多...
It would appear that waitresses are one of the many groups...

143
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,640
不时受到政府欺压的群体之一
the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis.

144
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,510
给我一份说政府不该这样干的报纸
Show me a paper that says the government shouldn't do

145
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,290
我会签名
that I'll sign it.

146
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,000
我会表示支持  但我不会做发起人
I'll vote for it. But what I won't do is play ball.

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,990
至于未受过大学教育
This non-college bullshit

148
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,990
我称之为  不学好样
I got two words for that: Learn to fuckin' type.

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,720
如果你指望我为此掏钱
If you're expectin' me to help out with the rent

150
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,440
那你会大失所望
you're in for a big surprise.

151
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,380
有道理  把我的钱还我
He's convinced me. Give me my dollar back.

152
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,880
嘿  别碰那些钱
Hey. Leave the dollars there.

153
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,490
好了  各位  我们走吧
All right ramblers let's get ramblin'.

154
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,250
等等  谁没掏钱  
Wait a minute. Who didn't throw in?

155
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,060
-粉先生  -粉先生  
-Mr. Pink. -Mr. Pink?

156
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,750
-为什么  -他不付小费
-Why not? -He don't tip.

157
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,730
他不付小费  
He don't tip?

158
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,730
-你不付小费  -他不赞成
-You don't tip? -He don't believe in it.

159
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,190
闭嘴  什么意思  你不赞成这样做  
Shut up. What do you mean you don't believe in it?

160
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,610
快掏钱  你这下流坯
Cough up a buck you cheap bastard.

161
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,990
我已经请你们吃了他妈的早餐
I paid for your goddamn breakfast.

162
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,960
既然你请了早餐  我掏钱好了
Since you bought breakfast I'll put in.

163
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,930
但平时我可不干
But normally I would never do this.

164
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,230
不管你平时怎么做
Never mind what you normally would do.

165
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,850
只管像其他人一样  掏出你那该死的一块钱  谢谢
Just cough in your goddamn buck like everybody else. Thank you.

166
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,730
这是帕特里奇家族
That was the Partridge Family's

167
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,810
上演的"谁想逃帐"
"Doesn't Somebody Want To Be Wanted? "...

168
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,130
接下来是爱迪生・莱特豪斯的  
followed by Edison Lighthouse's...

169
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,410
"爱随我的迷迭香成长"
"Love Grows Where My Rosemary Goes"...

170
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,140
就像K・比利的"70年代超级声"一样
as K-BILLY's "Super Sounds of the '70s" weekend...

171
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,620
请继续收听
just keeps on truckin'.

172
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,130
请继续收听
just keeps on truckin'.

173
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,200
我要死了
I'm gonna die.

174
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,200
我要死了
I'm gonna die!

175
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,230
坚持住  伙计
Just hold on buddy boy!

176
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,900
我要死了
I'm gonna die!

177
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,330
-对不起  -把你的手给我
-I'm sorry! -Give me your hand.

178
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,760
真不敢相信她想杀了我  老兄  有谁能料到  
I can't believe she killed me man! Who'd have fuckin' thought that?

179
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,400
嘿  现在别说那些废话了
Hey just cancel that shit right now!

180
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,350
你受了伤  确实伤得很重  但你不会死
You're hurt. You're hurt real fuckin' bad but you ain't dying!

181
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,690
这些血吓死我了  拉里
All this blood's scarin' the shit out of me Larry!

182
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,200
我要死了  我知道
I'm gonna die! I know it!

183
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,320
抱歉  我不知道你有医学学位
Excuse me I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine.

184
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,480
你是医生  
Are you a doctor?

185
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,450
你是医生吗  
Are you a doctor?

186
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,980
请回答我  你是医生吗  
Answer me please! Are you a doctor?

187
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,770
不  我不是  我不是
No I'm not. I'm not.

188
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,910
那么你承认不知道自己在说什么了
So you admit you don't know what you're talkin' about.

189
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,270
如果你说完了你的业余看法
If you're through givin' me your amateur opinion

190
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,610
躺回去听我说
lie back and listen.

191
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,370
我带你到会合地点
I'm takin' you back to the rendezvous

192
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,040
乔会替你找个医生
Joe's gonna get you a doctor...

193
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,850
医生会给你治伤...
the doctor's gonna fix you up and...

194
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,130
你会没事的
you're gonna be okay.

195
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,650
现在说  "你会没事的"
Now say it! You're gonna be okay!

196
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,070
说啊
Say it!

197
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,030
你会没事的
You're gonna be okay!

198
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,200
把这该死的话说出来  你会没事的
Say the goddamn words! You're gonna be okay!

199
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,680
上帝啊
Oh God!

200
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,860
他妈的说啊
Say the goddamn fuckin' words!

201
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,510
说
Say it!

202
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,770
好的  拉里
Okay Larry.

203
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,780
好好说  好好说
Correct! Correct!

204
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,380
我很好
I'm okay.

205
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,700
看看我们到哪了
Look where we are.

206
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,480
看看我们到哪了
Look where we are.

207
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,400
她怀了孩子  老兄  她怀了孩子
She had a baby man. She had a baby!

208
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,330
我们在仓库里
We're in a warehouse.

209
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,790
谁是硬汉  谁是硬汉  
Who's a tough guy? Who's a tough guy?

210
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,670
-回答我  谁是硬汉  -我是硬汉
-Come on who's a tough guy? -I am a tough guy

211
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,570
谁是硬汉  你是硬汉
Who's a tough guy? You're a tough guy.

212
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,540
你是个他妈的硬汉
You're a fuckin' tough guy.

213
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,750
我们在仓库里  看看我们在哪
We're in a warehouse. Look where we are.

214
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,170
我们到了  我们到了
We made it. We made it.

215
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,580
我们他妈的到了  我们现在他妈的到了
We fuckin' made it. We have fuckin' made it.

216
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,660
我们在仓库里  看看我们在哪

218
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,830
撑住  撑住
Hold on. Hold on.

219
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,650
-妈的  -别再撞你的头
-Shit! -Stop bangin' your head.

220
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,190
你要在地板上撞出一个洞来了
You're gonna bang a fuckin' hole in the floor.

221
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,990
你不想弄坏他妈的地板对吗  
You don't wanna hurt the fuckin' floor do you?

222
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,210
我没法为你做任何事
I can't do anything for you.

223
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,770
但只要乔一到这...
But when Joe gets here...

224
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,810
他随时都会赶来...
which should be any time now...

225
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,070
他会帮助你  会照顾你
he's gonna help you out he's gonna take care of you.

226
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,550
我们得坐下等着乔
We're gonna sit and wait for Joe.

227
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,090
-我们在等谁  -乔
-Who are we waitin' for? -Joe.

228
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,620
拉里  我他妈的害怕  老兄
Larry I'm fucking scared man.

229
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,350
你能抱着我吗  
Would you please hold me?

230
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,170
是的  当然
Yeah sure.

231
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,820
你有理由害怕
You go ahead and be scared.

232
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,300
你今天已经够勇敢的了
You've been brave enough for one day.

233
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,740
现在我要你放松  明白吗  
I just want you to relax now okay?

234
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,100
你不会死  你会好起来的
You're not gonna fuckin' die. You're gonna be fine.

235
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,680
乔一到这  就会让你完好如初的
When Joe gets here he'll make you 100% again.

236
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,890
我受伤了是吗  我伤得很重  拉里
Am I hurt? I'm hurt bad Larry.

237
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,980
情况是不太妙
It's not good no.

238
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,410
嘿  拉里
Hey Larry...

239
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,610
感谢你为我做的努力
bless your heart for what you're tryin' to do.

240
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,540
我刚才在那惊慌失措
I was panicking for a minute back there.

241
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,760
但是我现在清醒过来了
But I got my senses back now.

242
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,890
现在的情况是我腹部中枪
The situation is I'm shot in the belly.

243
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,130
没有医生救治我会死的
Without medical attention I'm gonna die.

244
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,250
-我不能带你去医院  -去他妈的监狱  老兄
-I can't take you to a hospital. -Fuck jail man!

245
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,930
你不用带我进去  只要把我送到门口就行
You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front man.

246
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,710
把我扔在人行便道上  我会照顾自己
Just drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself.

247
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,470
我不会告诉他们任何事  老兄  我什么都不会说
I won't tell 'em anything man. I won't tell 'em anything.

248
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,170
我向他妈的上帝发誓  老兄
I swear to fucking God man.

249
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,450
看着我的眼睛  拉里  看着我的眼睛
Just look in my eyes Larry. Look in my eyes.

250
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,300
我什么都不会告诉他们
I won't tell them anything.

251
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,220
你会很安全  老兄
You'll be safe man.

252
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:00,740
你不会他妈的死掉  小伙子  对吗  
You're not gonna fuckin' die kid. All right?

253
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,910
听我说  你会好起来的
Listen to me. You're gonna be fine.

254
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,300
和膝盖一样...
Along with the kneecap...

255
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,960
内脏被打中是最痛的部位
the gut is the most painful area a guy can get shot in.

256
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,130
别说笑了
No shit!

257
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,040
但是要过很长时间才会致命
But it takes a long time to die from it.

258
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,530
得好几天
I'm talkin' days.

259
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,720
你会宁可死掉
You're gonna wish you were dead

260
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,840
但是得好几天你才会死
but it takes days to die from your wound.

261
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,570
你有的是时间
Time is on your side.

262
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,930
那是不是个他妈的圈套  
Was that a fucking setup or what?

263
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,520
该死  橙挂彩了  
Shit. Orange got tagged?

264
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,350
腹部中枪
Gut shot.

265
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,710
妈的  褐在哪  
Fuck. Where's Brown?

266
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,070
死了
Dead.

267
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,630
怎么死的  
How did he die?

268
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,990
他妈的你以为呢  警察击毙了他
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.

269
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,070
真是糟糕
This is bad.

270
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,980
是他妈的非常糟  不是吗  
This is so fucking bad. Is it bad?

271
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,660
相对"好"而言吗  
As opposed to good?

272
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,980
老兄  真是糟糕
Man this is fucked up.

273
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,330
真是太糟糕了
This is so fucked up.

274
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,360
有人出卖了我们  老兄
Somebody fucked us up big time man.

275
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,070
-你真的觉得我们是中了埋伏  -你一点不怀疑吗  
-You really think we were set up? -Do you even doubt it man?

276
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,340
我们肯定是中了埋伏  我知道
I don't think we got set up I know it.

277
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,600
所有那些警察是从哪来的  嗯  
Where did all those cops come from huh?

278
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,020
前一分钟还不在  下一分钟就来了
One minute they're not there and the next minute they're there.

279
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,420
我根本没听到警报声  警报器响了是吗  
I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off okay?

280
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,990
当警报响了之后  你得要四分钟来作出反应
When an alarm goes you got a four-minute response time.

281
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,670
如果不是有辆巡逻车  正好在那条街上的话
Unless a patrol car is cruising that street at that moment...

282
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,300
在他们能作出反应之前你有四分钟
you got four minutes before they can realistically respond.

283
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,380
一分钟内  有十七个警察出现  
In one minute there were 17 blue boys out there...

284
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,140
全都清楚他们在嘛
all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing

285
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,840
他们早就埋伏在那了
and they were all there!

286
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,800
记得第二批出现的警车吗  
Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars?

287
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,430
那才是听到警报后赶来的
Those were the ones responding to the alarm

288
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,720
但第一批混蛋
but those first motherfuckers...

289
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,010
是早就埋伏在那的
they were there and they were waitin' for us.

290
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,580
你他妈的就没想过这些吗  
Haven't you fuckin' thought about this?

291
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,360
我根本没机会去想
I haven't had a chance to think.

292
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,760
我首先想到的就是他妈的逃跑
First I was just tryin' to get the fuck outta there.

293
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,910
而我们逃脱之后  我一直和他在一起
And after we got away I've just been dealin' with him.

294
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,290
最好快想  因为这很重要
Better start thinkin' about it 'cause that's all I'm thinkin' about.

295
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,250
我甚至不想来这  我想开车逃走  老兄...
I wasn't even gonna come here. I was just gonna drive off man...

296
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,900
因为不管内奸是谁  他都知道这地方
because whoever set us up knows about this place.

297
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,880
这里可能有警察在等着
There could've been cops here waitin'!

298
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,790
也许现在警察正在赶来
There could be cops comin' right now!

299
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,740
我们去另一个房间  嘿  在那边
Let's go in the other room. Hey. In there.

300
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,350
拉里  别离开我
Larry don't leave me.

301
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,400
我就在另一个房间好吗  我会在那看着你
I'll be right in the other room okay? I'll be right there lookin' at ya.

302
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,020
我会在这看着你  好吗  
I'm right here lookin' at you okay?

303
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,580
我就在那边
I'm right over there.

304
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,710
拉里
Larry...

305
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,090
我他妈的要死了
I'm gonna fucking die.

306
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,910
拉里
Larry.

307
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,380
我他妈的在这干什么  老兄
What the fuck am I doin' here man?

308
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,520
我觉得这活太有趣了
I felt funny about this job right off.

309
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,510
我一有这种感觉就该放弃
As soon as I felt it I should have said"No thank you"

310
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,400
但我没有
but I never fuckin' listen.

311
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,710
我每次买大麻都会这样
Every time I ever got fucked buying weed the same thing.

312
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,490
我不相信那家伙  但我想相信他
I didn't trust the guy but I wanted to believe him.

313
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,440
如果他没说谎而且真是泰国大麻  那倒也不错
If he's not lying and it really is Thai stick then it's great.

314
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,210
但从来都不是
But it never is

315
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,930
我总说行动时有那种感觉我就离开
and I always said that if I felt that about a job I'd fuckin' walk.

316
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,160
但我没有  我没离开是因为该死的钱
And I didn't. I didn't because of the fuckin' money!

317
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,010
过去的就过去了  你冷静点
What's done is done. I need you cool.

318
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,980
你冷静了吗  
Are you cool?

319
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,700
我很冷静
I'm cool.

320
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,800
往脸上泼点水
Splash some water on your face.

321
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,390
做个深呼吸
Take a breather.

322
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,990
放松下来  抽支烟
Relax. Have a cigarette.

323
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,980
我戒了
I quit.

324
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,810
-好吧  -来支也好  你有吗  
-All right. -Why you got one?

325
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,280
好了  我们来想想发生了什么事
Okay let's go through what happened.

326
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,870
我们到了那  一切都很顺利
We're in the place everything's going fine.

327
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,060
然后警铃响了
Then the alarm gets tripped.

328
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,560
我一转身看到那些警察在外面
I turn around and all these cops are outside.

329
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,020
你说的没错  就像变魔术一样  我眨眨眼他们就在那了
You're right. It was like bam I blinked my eyes and they're there.

330
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,540
大家都开始惊慌  然后金先生开了枪
Everybody starts going ape-shit.Then Mr. Blonde starts to shoot all

331
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,520
-不是这样  -有什么不对  
-That's not correct. -What's wrong with it?

332
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,350
警铃响了后警察并没出现
Okay. The cops did not show up after the alarm went off.

333
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,190
金先生向所有人开枪之前
The cops didn't show up until after

334
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,010
警察并没出现
Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.

335
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,190
-接着我听到警铃声  看到了警察  -并没那么快
-Soon as I heard the alarm I saw cops. -It wasn't that soon.

336
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,210
在金先生发疯之前
They didn't let their presence be known

337
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,170
他们并没出现
until after Mr. Blonde became a madman.

338
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,130
我不是说他们不在那  他们早就在
I'm not sayin' they weren't there. I'm sayin' they were there.

339
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,200
但是他们
But they didn't make a move

340
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,180
在金先生开枪之前没有行动
until after Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.

341
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,140
所以我才知道是中了埋伏
I mean that's how I know we were set up.

342
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,590
-白先生  你能看到的  -别再叫什么鬼"白先生"了
-Mr. White you can see that... -Enough of this "Mr. White" shit.

343
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,340
等等  别告诉我你叫什么鬼名字  我不想知道
Wait! Don't tell me you're fuckin' name! I don't wanna know it!

344
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,960
老天  我可不想告诉你我叫什么
Jesus Christ I ain't gonna tell you mine.

345
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,560
你是对的  那没好处
You're right. This is bad.

346
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,520
-你是怎么逃脱的  -我杀出了一条血路
-How did you get out? -I shot my way out.

347
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,950
所有人都在开枪  所以我趁乱逃了出来
Everybody started shootin' so I blasted my way out of there.

348
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,090
躲开  让开路  他妈的让开路
Move it! Get outta the way! Get the fuck outta the way!

349
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,620
他妈的快躲开
Get the fuck outta the way!

350
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,960
让开  把路让开
Move it! Get outta the way!

351
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,760
老天  你他妈的有问题吗  老兄  
Jesus Christ! What the fuck is your problem man?

352
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:01,110
-你这该死的混蛋  -去你妈的
-You fuckin' asshole! -Fuck you!

353
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,070
让开
Move!

354
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,690
天啊
Jesus!

355
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,250
从车里出来  他妈的从车上下来
Get outta the car! Get the fuck outta the car!

356
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,510
闪开  从路上闪开
Move it! Move outta the way!

357
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,150
我打伤了几个警察
I tagged a couple of cops.

358
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,270
你杀了什么人吗  
Did you kill anybody?

359
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,550
-几个警察  -没有行人  
-A few cops. -No real people?

360
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,510
只杀了警察
Just cops.

361
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,920
你信任金先生吗  
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

362
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,400
那是我曾见过的最疯狂的事
That was the most insane fuckin' thing I have ever seen.

363
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,160
乔为什么找个这样的家伙  
Why the fuck would Joe hire a guy like that?

364
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,770
我不想杀人
I don't want to kill anybody.

365
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,520
但如果你想挡我的路...
If I gotta get out that door and you're standin' in my way...

366
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,020
要么我杀了你  要么你就让开
one way or the other you're gettin' outta my way.

367
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,450
这是我看待事情的方式
That's the way I look at it.

368
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,130
是坐十年牢...
The choice between doin' ten years...

369
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,010
还是干掉一个愚蠢的混蛋...
and takin' out some stupid motherfucker...

370
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,110
只能选择其一
ain't no choice at all.

371
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,910
但我并不是疯子
But I ain't no madman either.

372
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,800
乔他妈怎么想的  
What the fuck was Joe thinkin'?

373
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,690
你没法和那种家伙共事
You can't work with a guy like that.

374
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,800
万幸的是
We're awful goddamn lucky

375
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,550
他在那乱射一气时没伤到我们
he didn't tag us when he shot the place up.

376
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,640
我差一点就想弄死他了
I came this close to takin' his ass out myself.

377
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,700
我是说  所有人都很惊慌  所有人
I mean everybody panics. Everybody.

378
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,430
形势紧急  那是人的自然反应
Things get tense. It's human nature.

379
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,310
人的惊慌是无法控制的
You panic. I don't care what your name is you can't help it.

380
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,220
妈的  老兄  惊慌是发自内心的  知道吗  
Fuck man you panic on the inside in your head you know?

381
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,370
你给自己几秒钟
You give yourself a couple of seconds

382
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,510
看清楚形势
get ahold of it and deal with it.

383
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,100
你就不会在那
What you don't do is start shootin' up the place

384
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,630
开枪杀人
and start killin' people.

385
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:14,910
你的举动应该显得专业一点
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional.

386
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,240
一个精神病患不会是专业人士
A psychopath ain't a professional.

387
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,560
你无法和一个疯子共事
You can't work with a psychopath.

388
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,150
你不知道那些混蛋下一步会干嘛
You don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next.

389
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,240
我是说  老天
I mean Jesus Christ

390
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,500
你觉得那个黑人女孩有多大  二十  
how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty?

391
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,820
-也许二十一  -大概吧
-Maybe 21? -If that.

392
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,460
你知道其他人的情况吗  
Did you see what happened to anybody else?

393
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,230
我和橙跳上了车  褐被打死了
Me and Orange jumped in the car Brown floored it.

394
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,450
之后的事我就不知道了
After that I don't know what went down.

395
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,450
大家只能各顾各
It was every man for himself.

396
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,420
至于金先生和蓝先生
As far as Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue are concerned

397
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,500
我不清楚
I ain't got the foggiest...

398
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,800
我一逃出去就没回头看过
cause once I got out I never looked back.

399
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,850
你怎么想  
What do you think?

400
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,250
我怎么想  他们不是被抓了就是被杀了
What do I think? The cops either caught 'em or killed 'em.

401
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,690
没机会逃脱吗  你就逃脱了
No chance they punched through? You found a hole.

402
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,080
对  但这是个他妈的奇迹
Yeah and that was a fuckin' miracle.

403
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,980
就算他们逃脱了  那他们在哪  
But even if they did get away then where the fuck are they?

404
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,700
你没想过
You don't think

405
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,400
他们可能拿了钻石然后...
it's possible one of 'em got ahold of the diamonds and...

406
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:12,870
-不  决不会  -你怎么这样肯定  
-No no way. -How can you be so sure?

407
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,800
我拿了钻石
I got the diamonds.

408
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,710
好伙计
That's my boy.

409
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,520
-在哪  -我藏起来了
-Where? -I stashed 'em.

410
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,860
如果你想和我一起走  我们马上就去拿
If you wanna come with me let's go get 'em right now this second.

411
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,730
因为我觉得留在这  老兄
'Cause I think stayin' here man

412
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,500
我们就该检查一下脑袋了
we should have our fuckin' heads examined.

413
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,610
原计划是在这会面
That was the plan. We meet here.

414
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,610
那其他人在哪  
Then where the fuck is everybody?

415
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,260
只要发现有内奸
I say the plan becomes null

416
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,820
计划就可以取消
and void once we found out we got a rat here.

417
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,460
金先生和蓝先生
We ain't got the slightest idea

418
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,020
下落不明
what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue.

419
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,400
可能完了  也可能被抓住了
They could both be dead or maybe they're arrested.

420
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,950
警察也许正在
The cops could have 'em right now

421
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,430
警局盘问他们
at the station sweatin' 'em down.

422
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,290
他们不知道我们叫什么
They don't know our names

423
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,150
但也许会供出这地方
but they could be singin' about this place.

424
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,840
我向上帝发誓  我觉得我是个扫把星
I swear to God I think I'm fuckin' jinxed.

425
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,770
什么  
What?

426
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,650
有次买卖是四个人一起干的
Two jobs back it was a four-man job.

427
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,130
我们发现其中一个是警方的卧底
We discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.

428
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,660
不是吧  
No shit?

429
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,400
感谢上帝我们及时发现了
Thank God we discovered in time.

430
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,590
我们只好放弃整个计划  一走了之
We had to forget the whole thing just walk the fuck away from it.

431
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,800
那这次谁是内奸  
So who's the rat this time?

432
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,830
蓝先生  
Mr. Blue?

433
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,650
褐先生  
Mr. Brown?

434
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:40,020
乔  乔策划的整个计划  也许全都是他在捣鬼
Joe? Joe set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.

435
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:43,530
我不这么想  我和乔认识很久了
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time.

436
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,260
我可以断然告诉你
I can tell you definitely

437
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,930
乔对这个圈套一无所知
Joe didn't know a thing about this bullshit.

438
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,360
我了解乔  如果我说他肯定
I know Joe and me sayin' he definitely

439
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,690
和这无关就太可笑了
had nothin' to do with it is ridiculous.

440
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,280
我可以断定不是我
I can say I definitely didn't do it

441
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,790
我知道自己做没做
cause I know what I did or didn't do.

442
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,580
但我无法断定其他人有没有做
But I cannot definitely say that about

443
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,320
因为确实不知道
anybody cause I don't definitely know.

444
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,450
在我看来  你就是内奸
For all I know you're the rat.

445
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,910
在我看来  你才是他妈的内奸
For all I know you're the fuckin' rat!

446
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,340
很好  现在你他妈的在用脑子了
All right now you're usin' your fuckin' head.

447
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,880
现在看来  他是内奸
For all we know he's the rat.

448
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:11,250
这孩子快死了  我亲眼看到他中枪...
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet I saw him take...

449
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,400
所以你不能说他是内奸
so don't you be calling him a rat!

450
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,850
听着  我是对的  明白吗  
Look I'm right okay?

451
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,420
有人是他妈的内奸
Somebody's a fuckin' rat.

452
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,760
这地牢的厕所在哪  我要撒尿
Where's the commode in this dungeon? I gotta take a squirt.

453
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,550
沿走廊一直走  左转  上楼梯...
Go down the hall make a left go up the stairs...

454
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,520
然后右转
and make a right.

455
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:45,010
-顺便问一下  阿拉巴马怎么样  -阿拉巴马  
-By the way how's Alabama? -Alabama?

456
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,700
我有一年半没见过她了
I haven't seen Bama in over a year and a half.

457
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,160
但我想你们俩是一组的
But I thought you two were a team.

458
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,140
有段时间是
We were for a little while.

459
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:57,940
一起干了四次买卖  然后决定拆伙
Did about four jobs together then decided to call it quits.

460
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,490
为什么  
Why?

461
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,530
你做那种男男女女的事太久
You push that woman-man thing too long

462
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,490
一段时间后就会对你有影响
and it gets to you after a while.

463
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,660
她现在在干嘛  
What's she doin' now?

464
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,470
她搭上了弗兰克-麦加
She hooked up with Frank McGar.

465
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,280
他们一起干了几票
They've done a couple jobs together.

466
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,460
该死的女人  精明的小贼
Hell of a woman. Good little thief.

467
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,680
白先生

468
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:21,900
-电报里说了什么  -五个人的工作
-So explain the telegram. -Five-man job.

469
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,210
一个钻石批发商的场子
Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.

470
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,790
事后你能脱手吗  
Can you move the ice afterwards?

471
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,280
我可没这种熟人
I don't know nobody that can move ice.

472
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,480
没问题  有人正在等这批货
No problem. We got guys waitin' for it.

473
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,250
马赛罗-斯派维怎么了  
What happened to Marcellus Spivey?

474
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,940
他不是一直处理你的钻石吗  
Didn't he always move your ice?

475
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,440
他要在苏珊维尔蹲二十年大狱
He's doin' 20 years in Susanville.

476
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,800
二十年  上帝  怎么回事  
Twenty years? Holy God. What for?

477
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,230
运气不好
Bad luck.

478
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,150
我猜你会这么说
I guess you can say that again.

479
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,020
行动要多长时间  
What's the exposure like?

480
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:48,030
最多两分钟  但很棘手
Two minutes tops. But it's a tough two minutes.

481
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,580
白天  交易时间  大群的人
Daylight during business hours dealing with a crowd.

482
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,090
但会有人帮你应付人群
But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.

483
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,010
-有多少店员  -二十个左右
-How many employees? -I'd say around 20.

484
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,790
保安相当松懈
Security pretty lax.

485
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,290
他们平时的主要业务是打包
They most usually just deal in boxes.

486
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,410
来自钻石财团的未经切割的钻石
You know uncut stones from the diamond syndicate.

487
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,850
但那天他们有批货
But on this day they're getting a shipment

488
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,230
是从以色列来的打磨好的钻石
of polished stones from lsrael.

489
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,460
他们就像中转站  懂吗  
They're like a way station you know?

490
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,950
-他们接手后会送往佛蒙特  -不  不会
-They get picked up and sent to Vermont. -No they're not.

491
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,350
油水怎样  老爹  
What's the cut poppa?

492
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:24,130
很大  年轻人  非常大
Juicy junior. Real juicy.

493
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,320
听着  伙计  你做你想做的
Look man you do what you want.

494
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,200
我要离开这  老兄  我要找个旅馆呆几天
I'm outta here man. I'm gonna check into a motel for a few days.

495
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,310
我得躲躲  过后再打电话给乔
You know I'll lay low and I'll call Joe--

496
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,960
该死  他死在我们手上了吗  
Shit. Did he fuckin' die on us?

497
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,280
他是死了还是怎么了  
Huh? ls he dead or what?

498
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,700
-他没死  -那是怎么了  
-He ain't dead. -What is it?

499
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,360
他只是昏倒了
I think he's just passed out.

500
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,590
他妈的吓死我了
He scared the fuckin' shit outta me.

501
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,680
我还以为他真的死了
I thought he was dead for sure.

502
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,500
没有医生救治  他真的会死
Without medical attention he will die for sure.

503
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,540
我们该怎么办  老兄  我们不能送他去医院
What are we gonna do man? We can't take him to the hospital.

504
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:06,150
没有医生救治  他也许活不过今晚
Without medical attention he might not live through the night.

505
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,900
他中枪是我的错
The bullet in his belly is my fault.

506
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,900
对你来说也许不算什么
While that might not mean jack shit to you

507
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,890
对我来说却很重要
it means a hell of a lot to me.

508
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,610
事有轻重缓急  懂吗  
First things first okay?

509
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,760
傻瓜才会留在这  我们得有准备
Stayin' here's goofy. We gotta book up.

510
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:19,370
那你说该怎么办  去旅馆  
So what do you suggest we do? Go to a hotel?

511
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,560
我们有个腹部中枪没法走路的人
We got a guy who's shot in the belly

512
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,680
血流得像头中了梭镖的猪
who can't walk bleeds like a stuck pig.

513
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,040
醒来时会痛得大喊大叫
And when he's awake he screams in pain.

514
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,120
你有办法就说
You got an idea spit it out.

515
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,990
乔可以帮忙
Joe could help.

516
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:35,950
如果我们能联系上乔  乔能给他找个医生
If we could get in touch with Joe Joe could get him to a doctor.

517
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,940
乔能找个医生来看看他
Joe could get a doctor to come to see him.

518
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:43,160
就算我们可以相信乔  可怎么和他取得联系  
Assuming we can trust Joe how we gonna get in touch with him?

519
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,190
他应该来的  但他没来
He's supposed to be here but he ain't

520
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,220
这让我对留在这感到不安
which makes me nervous about bein' here.

521
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,160
就算他是可靠的
Even if he is on the up and up

522
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,960
我认为他也不会高兴和我们在一起
I don't think he's gonna be too happy with us.

523
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,550
他策划抢劫  结果成了一场屠杀
He planned a robbery and he's got a bloodbath on his hands now.

524
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,940
他得到了死警察  死劫匪  死平民
He's got dead cops dead robbers dead civilians.

525
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,750
我很怀疑  他能对我们有多少同情
I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight.

526
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,300
如果我是他  我会尽可能
If I was him I'd put as much distance

527
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,660
让自己离这趟混水远点
between me and this mess as possible.

528
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:11,030
你到这之前  橙先生...
Before you got here Mr. Orange...

529
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,890
要我送他去医院看医生
was askin' me to take him to a doctor to a hospital.

530
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,960
我不喜欢  这个会把他送到警察手上的主意
I don't like the idea of turnin' him over to the cops...

531
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,770
可我不这样做他就会死
but if we don't he's gonna die.

532
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:25,680
他求我那样做
He begged me to do it.

533
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:29,670
好吧  我想我们可以送他去医院
Well all right. Then I guess we take him to a hospital.

534
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,950
他那样说的话  照做好了
If that's what he said let's do it.

535
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,680
既然他不知道我们的底细  就照他说的办
Since he don't know nothin' about us I say it's his decision.

536
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,430
他知道一些我的事
He knows a little about me.

537
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,850
什么  等等  你跟他说了你的名字吗  
What? Wait wait. You didn't tell him your name did you?

538
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,990
我告诉过他我的名和我从哪来
I told him my first name and where I was from.

539
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,520
为什么  
Why?

540
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,660
几天前我告诉他我是哪里人
I told him where I was from a few days ago.

541
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,470
那只是普通的闲聊
It was just a natural conversation.

542
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:57,570
你告诉他名字又是为什么  
What was tellin' him your name when you weren't supposed to?

543
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,180
他问的我
He asked.

544
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,230
我们刚摆脱警察时  他中了枪
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot.

545
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,770
他中枪是我的错
It was my fault he got shot.

546
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,290
他浑身都是血
He's a fuckin' bloody mess.

547
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,760
大声尖叫着
He's screamin'.

548
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:16,020
我发誓我以为他会死在那
I swear to God I thought he was gonna die right then and there.

549
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,020
我想安慰他  告诉他别担心...
I'm tryin' to comfort him telling him not to worry...

550
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,720
一切都会好起来  我会照顾他
everything's going to be okay I'm gonna take care of him.

551
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,140
然后他问我叫什么
And he asked me what my name was.

552
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,210
我是说  他要死在我怀里了
I mean the man was dyin' in my arms.

553
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,490
我他妈的能怎么做  
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

554
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:38,730
告诉他我很抱歉  我不能透露这个该死的信息  
Tell him I'm sorry? I can't give out that fuckin' information?

555
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,850
这坏了规矩  
It's against the rules?

556
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,860
我不够信任你  
I don't trust you enough?

557
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:48,160
也许我该那样做  但我做不到
Maybe I should've but I couldn't.

558
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,700
去你的  去他妈的乔
Fuck you! Fuck Joe!

559
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:54,290
-我确信那是个动人的场景  -别他妈的装腔作势
-I'm sure it was a beautiful scene. -Don't fuckin' patronize me!

560
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,650
我有个问题
I have one question.

561
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,810
警察有你的资料吗  
Do they have a sheet on you where you're from?

562
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,180
-有  -那就是了
-Yeah! -That's that then.

563
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:02,110
我是说  我担心警察会让他辨认你的照片
I mean I was worried about mug shot possibility as it was.

564
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,400
他知道 A 你的名字 B 你的相貌
He knows A your name B your face C

565
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,500
C 你的家乡 D 你的专长
your hometown and D your specialty.

566
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:08,330
他们用不着给他看太多照片
They're not gonna have to show him a lot of pictures

567
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,850
就能把你认出来
for him to pick you out!

568
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,780
你没说别的什么
You didn't tell him anything else

569
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,510
能让警察更容易找出你的资料吧  
so they could narrow down the selection?

570
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,450
如果我不得不再次要你作出让步
If I have to tell you again to back off

571
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,180
我们就会没完没了了
we're gonna go round and round.

572
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:20,190
我们不能送他去医院
We ain't takin' him to a hospital.

573
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,940
如果不送他去  他会死掉
If we don't he's gonna die.

574
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,550
对此我很难过
And I'm very sad about that

575
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,080
但有人运气好有人运气差
but some fellas are lucky and some ain't.

576
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,830
你他妈的干嘛抓住我  
What the fuck are you touchin' me for man?

577
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,270
让你明白在和谁打交道
I'll show you who you're fuckin' with!

578
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,510
你想向我开枪吗  来啊  开枪啊
You wanna shoot me you piece of shit?

579
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,670
不是我造成的这个局面  我是在想办法
I didn't create this situation I'm dealin' with it!

580
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,510
你的做法像个刚出道的小毛贼  我的做法才像个行家
You're actin' like a first-year thief! I'm actin' like a professional!

581
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,390
如果警察抓住他  就可能抓到你我...
If they get him they could get you they could get closer to me...

582
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,430
不能让这事发生
and that can't happen!

583
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,250
这难道怪我吗  我可没告诉他我叫什么
You're lookin' at me like it's my fault? I didn't tell him my name!

584
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,790
也没告诉他我是哪里人
I didn't tell him where I was from!

585
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,490
妈的  十五分钟前你几乎告诉我你叫什么
Shit! Fifteen minutes ago you almost told me your name!

586
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,770
你自己惹的乱子得自己应付
You're gonna get stuck in a situation you created!

587
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,270
如果你想找人发泄  对着镜子发泄好了
So if you wanna throw bad looks around throw 'em at a mirror!

588
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,270
你们不该表现得这样粗鲁
You kids shouldn't play so rough.

589
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:09,210
有人要开始哭了
Somebody's gonna start cryin'.

590
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,920
金先生
Mr. Blonde.

591
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,280
你他妈的踢了我
Shit. You're fuckin' kickin' me.

592
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:23,910
你出了什么状况  还以为你死了呢
What happened to you? Figured you were dead.

593
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,190
嘿  你没事吧  
Hey you okay?

594
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,830
你知道蓝的下落吗  
Did you see what happened to Blue?

595
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,780
我们不知道你们出了什么问题
We didn't know what happened to you.

596
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,520
这是我们想知道的
That's what we were wonderin' about.

597
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:42,400
听着  褐已经死了  橙腹部中了枪
Look Brown is dead Orange got it in the belly.

598
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,710
够了  够了
Enough! Enough!

599
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,870
你最好快说  混蛋
You better start talkin' asshole.

600
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,820
因为我们还有要紧的事要说
'Cause we got shit we need to talk about.

601
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,630
我们已经绞尽脑汁
We're already freaked out.

602
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:56,120
我们需要你加入来帮我们弄清楚
We need you actin' freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.

603
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,930
好吧  让我们谈谈
Okay let's talk.

604
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,430
我们认为在这房子里有个内奸
We think we got a rat in the house.

605
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,490
我肯定我们当中有个内奸
I guarantee we got a rat in the house.

606
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,370
你为什么这样说  
What makes you say that?

607
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,430
那样想很有趣吗  
Is that supposed to be funny?

608
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,260
听着  我们觉得这地方不安全
Look we think this place ain't safe.

609
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,780
这儿不再安全
This place ain't secure anymore.

610
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,100
你该和我们一起离开
We're leavin' and you should go with us.

611
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,410
谁都别想离开
Nobody's goin' anywhere.

612
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:19,000
去他的臭狗屎
Piss on this fuckin' turd.

613
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:22,240
-我们离开这  -别再走一步  白先生
-We're outta here. -Don't take another step Mr. White.

614
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,120
去你妈的  疯子
Fuck you maniac!

615
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,930
我们身处困境都他妈怪你
It's your fuckin' fault we're in this trouble!

616
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,510
这家伙有什么问题  
What's this guy's problem?

617
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,560
我有什么问题  对  我有个见鬼的问题
What's my problem? Yeah I got a fuckin' problem!

618
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,400
我有个该死的大问题...
I got a big fuckin' problem...

619
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,490
就是和一个胡乱开枪  几乎将我干掉的疯子在一起
with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!

620
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:47,020
-你他妈的在说什么  -说你那该死的疯狂射击
-What the fuck you talkin' about? -That fucking shooting spree!

621
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,510
在那个店里  记得吗  
In the store! Remember?

622
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:55,390
哦  去他妈的  他们启动了报警装置  他们活该
Oh fuck 'em. They set off the alarm. They deserve what they got.

623
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,450
你几乎杀了我
You almost killed me!

624
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,790
混蛋
Asshole!

625
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,190
如果我早知道你这么疯
If I knew what kind of guy you were

626
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,200
我绝不会同意和你共事
I never would've agreed to work with you.

627
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,310
小狗  你要吠上一整天...
Are you gonna bark all day little doggie...

628
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,340
还是要咬人  
or are you gonna bite?

629
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,530
你说什么  
What was that?

630
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:21,990
对不起  我没听清  你能再说一次吗  
I'm sorry I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?

631
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,830
你想叫上一整天  小狗...
Are you gonna bark all day little doggie...

632
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,920
还是想咬人  
or are you gonna bite?

633
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,980
你们两个混蛋  他妈的冷静点  别这样
You two assholes calm the fuck down! Hey come on!

634
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,610
我们难道是在角斗场吗  我是唯一的专业人士吗  
What are we on a playground here? Am I the only professional?

635
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,060
你们的举止就像两个他妈的黑鬼
You're actin' like a bunch of fuckin' niggers!

636
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,840
跟黑鬼合作过吗  
Ever work with niggers? Always sayin

637
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,420
他们总说要干掉对方
they're gonna kill each other.

638
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,440
你说过想把他干掉
You said yourself you thought about taking him out.

639
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,060
-你他妈的那样说过  -对  那又怎么样  
-You fuckin' said that? -Yeah I did okay?

640
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,020
但那是之前  现在
But that was then. Right now

641
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,790
这家伙是我唯一信得过的人
this guy is the only one I completely trust.

642
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,700
-对付警察时他最狠  -你站在他那边  
-He's too homicidal to be with the cops. -You takin' his side?

643
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,760
去他妈的立场  老兄  我们现在需要团结
Fuck sides man! What we need here is solidarity!

644
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,870
有人用烧红的火钳捅我们的屁股
Somebody's stickin' a red-hot poker up our ass

645
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,770
我要把他找出来
and I want to know who.

646
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,700
妈的  听着  我知道我不是内奸
Fuck. Look I know I'm no piece of shit.

647
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,810
我十分肯定你没问题
I'm pretty sure you're okay

648
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,680
我他妈的也相信你没问题
and I'm fuckin' positive you're on the level.

649
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,510
所以让我们仔细想想谁是内奸  行吗  
So let's try and figure out who the bad guy is all right?

650
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:18,810
这真是令人兴奋
Wow. That was really exciting.

651
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:23,700
我打赌你是李・马文的拥趸  对吗  
I bet you're a big Lee Marvin fan aren't ya?

652
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,090
我也是  我喜欢那家伙
Yeah me too. I love that guy.

653
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:35,460
我的心跳很快  几乎心脏病发
My heart's beatin' so fast I'm about to have a heart attack here.

654
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,080
我有些东西在外面
I got somethin' outside that

655
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,370
我想让你们看看  跟我来

656
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,330
跟你去  去哪

657
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,960
去我的车
To my car.

658
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,560
你忘了你的薯条和汽水吗  
Did you forget your French fries to go with the soda?

659
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,570
不  我已经吃过了
No I had them already.

660
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,390
有些东西我觉得你们没准想看看
I got somethin' I think you might wanna see though.

661
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,470
-是什么  -一个大惊喜

我肯定你会喜欢它  来吧
I'm sure you'll like it. Come on.

663
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,750
我们还是离开这吧
We still gotta get outta here you know.

664
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,260
不  我们得留下继续等
No. We're gonna stick around and we're gonna wait.

665
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:15,680
-等什么  警察吗  -不  是等"好家伙"艾迪
-What for? The cops? -No. Nice Guy Eddie.

666
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,080
"好家伙"艾迪  你怎么认为
Nice Guy Eddie? What makes you think

667
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,270
他不是在去哥斯达黎加的飞机上呢  
he isn't on a plane halfway to Costa Rica?

668
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,100
因为我和他通过电话
Because I spoke to him on the phone

669
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,690
他说他在来这的路上
and he said he's on the way down here.

670
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,440
你和"好家伙"艾迪谈过  
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie?

671
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,990
为什么你不早说  
Why didn't you say that in the first place?

672
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,870
-你没问过我  -非常幽默
-'Cause you never asked me. -Hardy-fuckin'-har.

673
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,130
-他怎么说  -他说留在原地
-What'd he say? -He said stay put.

674
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,700
这段时间里...
So in the meantime...

675
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,470
我会给你们看点东西
I'll show you guys somethin'.

676
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,650
老天
Jesus Christ.

677
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,700
也许我们穿制服的朋友  可以回答一些...
Maybe our boy in blue here can answer some of these questions...

678
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,150
你们讨论过的有关内奸的问题
about this rat business you've been talkin' about.

679
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:54,190
真有你的  伙计
You're a piece of work my friend.

680
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,330
让我们把他妈的弄出来
Let's get him the fuck outta here.

681
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,430
金先生

682
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,930
嘿  你能放松点吗  
Hey Sid will you relax?

683
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,270
我认识你很长时间了  我不会担心
I've known you a long time. I'm not worried.

684

我知道你会报答我
I know you'll pay me back.

685
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,690
别跟我说我早就知道的东西  别让我尴尬
Don't tell me what I already know. Don't embarrass me.

686
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:13,890
你有几个月过得很糟  过得和别人没什么两样
So you had a few bad months. You do what everybody else does.

687
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,480
我不在乎什么J・P・摩根或者欧文裁缝  
I don't care if it's J.P. Morgan or lrving the tailor.

688
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,800
你已经渡过难关了
You ride it out.

689
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,520
-维克・维加在外面  -等等
-Vic Vega's outside. -Hold on.

690
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,620
-谁  -维克・维加
-Who? -Vic Vega.

691
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,460
叫他进来  我得挂了

692
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:29,000
-进来吧  -有个朋友在等我
-Come on in. -A friend of mine's outside.

693

I'll be talkin' to you. Don't worry.

694
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,740
嘿  欢迎回来  维克
Hey welcome home Vic.

695
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,100
自由的感觉怎么样  嗯  
How does freedom feel huh?

696
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,370
-全都不同了  -没那么悲观
-It's a change. -Ain't that the sad truth.

697
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:48,380
坐下  脱掉你的外套  别客气
Sit down take your coat off make yourself at home.

698
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,390
-要喝一杯吗  -好的
-Have a little drink? -Yeah.

699
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:53,440
小雷蒙・马丁怎么样  
How about a little Remy Martin?

700
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,520
行
Sure.

701
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,560
你的假释官是谁  
Who's your parole officer?

702
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,930
西摩斯・斯盖里提
Seymour Scagnetti.

703
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,550
他怎么样  
How is he?

704
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:07,310
是个该死的混蛋  竟然不许我离开房子半步
He's a fuckin' asshole. Won't even let me leave the halfway house.

705
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,250
真让我惊诧不已
It never ceases to amaze me.

706
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,500
一个为了二十五美分
A fuckin' jungle bunny goes out

707
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,470
割破女人喉咙的小乖乖给放了出来
there slits a woman's throat for 25 cents...

708
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:17,440
却得整天和假释官呆在一起
he gets Doris Day for a parole officer.

709
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:21,090
一个像你这样的好小伙子  却和一个混蛋纠缠不清
A good fella like you winds up with a ball-bustin' prick.

710
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,990
我想让你知道我很感激
I want you to know I appreciate all

711
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,640
坐牢时你给我送的东西
the packages you sent me on the inside.

712
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,680
我能怎么样呢  
What the hell was I supposed to do?

713
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,710
把你忘了  
Forget about you?

714
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,640
我只想让你知道  那对我来说意味着很多
I just want you to know that it meant a lot to me.

715
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,310
那是我起码能做到的  我希望能做得更多
It was the least I could do. I wish to hell I could've done a lot more.

716
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,380
非常感谢  乔
Thanks a lot Joe.

717
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,940
啊  维克

00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,120
牙签维克

00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,700
跟我说说你的故事  孩子  你有什么打算  
So tell me your story kid. What are your plans?

720
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:56,280
你这狗娘养的  真不敢相信是你坐在那
You son of a bitch. I see you sittin' there but I don't believe it.

721
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,820
-你怎么样  牙签  -嘿  艾迪
-How you doin' Toothpick? -Hey Eddie.

听着  我很抱歉  我该亲自去接你的
Listen I'm sorry. I should've picked you up myself.

723
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,580
我...我他妈的- -这礼拜太疯狂了
I was... My fuckin'...This week's been crazy.

724
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,900
我忙得头都挨着屁股了
I've had my head up my ass the whole time.

725
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,600
你的话很有趣
Funny you say that cause that's

726
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,040
我和你爸爸正在说这事
what me and your daddy were talkin' about.

727
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,540
是说我该亲自去接你吗  
That I should've picked you up?

728
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,750
是说你头挨着屁股
No that you had your head up your ass.

729
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,180
我一来  他像在说  "维克...
I walk in the door he's like "Vic Vic...

730
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:27,890
"真高兴  总算有个知道该怎么做的人来了
I'm so glad somebody's finally here who knows what's goin' on.

731
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,610
"我儿子艾迪是个糊涂蛋
My son Eddie's a fuck-up.

732
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,690
"他只会毁了这些生意
He's ruining the business.

733
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,790
"我是说  我爱这家伙
I mean I love the guy

734
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,600
但他做的每件事都一塌糊涂"
but he's flushin' everything down the toilet."

735
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,860
那是你说的对吗  乔  你自己告诉他
That's what you said right Joe? Tell him yourself.

736
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,780
艾迪  我讨厌你听到这些
Eddie I hate for you to hear it like this...

737
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,580
但维克进来问我生意怎么样
but Vic came in and asked me how business was.

738
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:50,620
你不能对一个  在监狱里呆了四年的家伙说谎
You don't lie to a guy who's just done four years in the slammer.

739
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,010
就是这样
That's very true.

740
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,740
好了  闹够了  歇歇吧
All right enough of this shit! Break it up!

741
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:02,090
好了  这不是角斗场
Come on this ain't a playground!

742
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,590
想在地上打滚就去艾迪的办公室
You guys wanna roll around on the floor

743
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,040
别在我这胡闹
you do it in Eddie's office not mine.

744
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,050
-老爹  看到没有  -什么  
-Daddy did you see that? -What?

745
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,260
他把我按在地上想操我
The guy got me on the ground he tried to fuck me.

746
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,950
-你求之不得  -你这变态混蛋  维克
-You wish. -You sick bastard Vic.

747
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,470
你想在我老爹的办公室操我
You tried to fuck me in my father's office.

748
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,230
听着  维克
Look Vic

749
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,740
不管你想在自己家干什么私事...
whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home...

750
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,110
尽管做  但别想操我
go to it but don't try to fuck me.

751
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,350
我可不会考虑你的好意
I don't think of you that way.

752
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,470
我很喜欢你  伙计  但我不会让你那样做
I like you a lot buddy but I don't think of you that way.

753
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,800
听着  如果我是个操屁眼的牛仔
Listen if I was a butt cowboy

754
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,990
我不会把你扔给那些暴徒
I wouldn't even throw you to the posse.

755
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,570
不  你不会  你会把我留给你自己
No you wouldn't. You'd keep me for yourself.

756
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,920
操了四年的屁股
Four years fuckin' punks up the ass

757
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,950
你肯定会对一个漂亮的身体感兴趣
you'd appreciate a piece of prime rib.

758
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,930
我可以撕碎你"好家伙"
I might break you in Nice Guy

759
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,470
但我会让你和狗做性伴侣
but I'd make you my dog's bitch.

760
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,190
真可悲是吧  老爹
Ain't that a sad sight Daddy?

761
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,930
进监狱时是白人
A man walks into prison a white man

762
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,430
出来后说话却像个黑鬼
walks out talkin' like a fuckin' nigger.

763
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,490
知道是为什么  大概是那些黑人的精液...
You know what? I think it's all that black semen...

764
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,130
从你屁眼灌进你脑子里了
pumped up your asshole now it's backed into your fuckin' brain...

765
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,030
而且还会从你嘴里流出来
and it's comin' out your mouth!

766
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,110
艾迪  你再像母狗一样说话
Eddie you keep talkin' like a bitch

767
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,930
我就会像对付母狗那样抽你
I'm gonna slap you like a bitch.

768
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,900
够了  真让我恶心
Enough of that shit! I'm sick of it!

769
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,160
现在你俩都坐下
Now both of you sit down.

770
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,490
艾迪  
Now Eddie...

771
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:24,530
你进来的时候我们在谈正事
when you came in here we were talkin' some serious business.

772
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,700
维克的假释官有点麻烦
Vic here's got a parole problem.

773
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,650
-谁是你的假释官  -西摩斯・斯盖里提
-Who's your P.O.? -Seymour Scagnetti.

774
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:33,360
斯盖里提  妈的
Scagnetti. Fuck.

775
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:37,430
-我听说他是个混蛋  -他就是个混蛋
-I hear he's a motherfucker. -Oh he's a fucker.

776
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,260
在我找到什么狗屁工作前
Won't even let me leave the halfway house

777
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,750
甚至不许离开住所半步
unless I get some shitty job.

778
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,210
你会回来替我们工作  对吗  
You're comin' back to work for us right?

779
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,690
我想回来
Well I wanna.

780
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:51,570
但我首先要向那猪脑子证明...
But first I gotta prove to uh ass-head...

781
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:55,060
我能找到一份像模像样的正式工作
that I can get a regular you know job-type job...

782
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:58,260
在我能自由行动之前
before I can move out on my own.

783
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,660
如果我得为此操心  我就不能回来替你们做事
I can't come back to work for you guys if I gotta worry about uh...

784
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,170
还有每天晚上十点...
makin' some silly-ass 10:00 curfew...

785
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:06,190
愚蠢的熄灯禁制
every fuckin' night.

786
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:09,640
我们能解决这些问题  是吧  艾迪  
We can work this out can't we Eddie?

787
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,700
并不太难办
This ain't all that bad.

788
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,780
我们可以给你找很多合法工作

I don't wanna lift no fuckin' crates Eddie.

791
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,670
你不用搬什么东西  你甚至不用干活
You ain't gonna lift shit. You don't even work there.

792
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,760
至于档案所记录的  是你在工作
But as far as the records are concerned you do.

793
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,880
我会给马修电话告诉他有个新人
I call Matthews and tell him he's got a new guy boom

794
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,710
你会在安排表上
you're on the rotation.

795
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:35,650
你会有一张卡记录你每天的出入时间
You get a time card. It's clocked in and out for you every day.

796
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,150
到了周末你会拿到一份不错的薪水
At the end of the week you get a nice paycheck.

797
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,350
码头工人很不赖
Dockworkers do very well.

798
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,970
你能搬进一个像样的地方
You can move into a halfway decent place

799
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,140
不会有斯盖里提问...
without Scagnetti goin'...

800
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,480
"这些钱是他妈从哪来的"
"Where the fuck's the money comin' from? "

801
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:49,030
另外  如果他决定做一次突然来访...
And if he decides to make a surprise visit...

802
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,380
我们就说派你去塔斯廷搬东西了
that's the day we sent you to Tustin to pick up a load of shit.

803

"你错过他了
You just missed him.

805
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:01,900
我们派他去塔夫托机场  要工作五小时
We had to send him to the Taft airstrip five fuckin' hours away.

806
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:04,810
"我们要他去提货然后带回这"
We had a load of shit he had to pick up there and bring back here."

807
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,380
你的工作决定你得到处跑  这是个漂亮的安排
Part of your job is goin' different places. That's the beauty of it.

808
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:11,120
我们到处都有生意
We got places all over the place.

809
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,480
懂了吗  我说过不用担心
See Vic? Did I tell you not to worry?

810
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:17,380
-维克曾担心过  -我明天带你去长滩
-Vic was worried. -I'll take you to Long Beach tomorrow.

811
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,390
我们会向马修介绍你  告诉他如此这般
We'll get you fixed up with Matthews I'll tell him what's what.

812
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:25,830
要知道  我真的很感激你们的安排
You know I really appreciate what you guys are doin'...

813
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,640
但我想知道我什么时候能回来
but I'd like to know when I can come back...

814
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:30,990
做些真正的工作
you know do some real work.

815
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:33,700
这可很难说
Well it's hard to say.

816
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,570
这是个特殊时刻
It's kind of a strange time now.

817
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:38,220
事情有点...
Things are kind of...

818
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,630
有点混乱  就是这样
They're a little fucked up is what they are.

819

我们要筹备在维加斯的一个大聚会

给你找个工作  一些现金
Get you a job give you some cash...

822
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:55,650
让那个斯盖里提从你背后滚开
and get this Scagnetti fuck off your back...

823
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:57,840
然后我们再跟你谈  行吗  
and then we'll talk to you all right?

824
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:04,480
老爹  我有个主意
Huh? Dad I got an idea.

825
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:07,400
听我说

I know you don't like usin' the boys on these jobs...

827
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,320
但维克在这

I mean he's only been nothin' but good luck for us.

829
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:18,600
这家伙绝不会抱怨叫苦
The guy's a fuckin' rabbit's foot for cryin' out loud.

我希望他能加入
I'd like to have him in.

831
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:24,100
你知道他能控制自己

而且你肯定可以信任他

889
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:52,480
乔怎么说  
What'd Joe say?

让我他妈的喘口气
Give me a fuckin'chance to breathe.

893

我自己也有几个问题
I got a few questions of my own here.

894
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:03,960
你不会死  他会

找谁  
Who?

897
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,800
你以为是找杂技演员吗  当然是找医生
A fuckin' snake charmer! Who do you think? I'll call a doctor.

898
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,750
他们会治好他  褐和蓝怎么样  
They'll fix him right up. What happened to Brown and Blue?

899
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:19,160
褐死了  蓝不知下落
Brown's dead. We don't know what happened to Blue.

900
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:21,140
褐死了  你肯定  
Brown's dead? Are you sure?

901
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:25,080
我肯定  我当时在那  他头上中了一枪
I'm sure. I was there. He took one in the head.

902
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:27,530
没人知道蓝先生怎么样吗  
Nobody's got a clue what happened to Mr. Blue?

903
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,790
也不知道他是死是活
Either he's alive or he's dead...

904
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,820
是被警察抓了还是没被抓
or the cops got him or they don't.

905
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,310
我得从这杂种嘴里问出来
I take it this is the bastard you told me about.

906
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,350
你们干嘛揍他  
Why are you beatin' on him?

907
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,130
也许他能说出谁是内奸
Maybe he could tell us who set us up.

908
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:44,700
你继续揍这杂种
If you fuckin'beat this prick long enough

909
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,970
他会告诉你芝加哥大火是他干的
he'll tell you he started the Chicago Fire.

910
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,890
这不会有多大用处
Now that don't necessarily make it fuckin' so!

911
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,220
拜托  伙计  用用脑子
Come on man think!

912
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,670
好了  最后一件要紧事
All right first things fuckin' last.

913
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:56,420
谁拿了钻石  
Who's got the stones?

914
00:49:56,430 --> 00:50:00,170
拜托  有谁能告诉我一点线索  
Please somebody tell me one little fuckin' favor.

915
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:01,920
在我手里
I got a bag.

916
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,000
满意了吗  我藏起来了
Okay? I stashed it 'til

917
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,950
我得先确定这地方还没变成警局
we could be sure this place wasn't a police station.

918
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:08,370
很好  我们现在去拿吧
Good for you. Now let's go get it.

919
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,620
首先我们得处理那些车
First we gotta get rid of those cars.

920
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,620
外面看起来就像停车场
It looks like Sam's Hot Car Lot outside.

921
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:13,820
好吧
Okay.

922
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,670
金留在这照看他们两个
Blondie stay here and baby-sit them two.

923
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,650
白和粉各开一辆车
White and Pink take a car each.

924
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,910
我跟在你们后面  扔掉车之后去取钻石
I'll follow you. You ditch 'em. Pick up the stones.

925
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,890
我会在路上
While I'm followin' you

926
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:27,350
替我们的朋友安排一个医生
I'll arrange some sort of a doctor for our friend.

927
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,400
不能让他和这家伙在一起
You can't leave these guys here with him.

928
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:32,860
-为什么  -因为他是个该死的疯子
-Why not? -Because he's a fuckin' psycho.

929
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,280
如果你觉得乔很恼火...
And if you think Joe's pissed off...

930
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:39,240
那绝对比不上我对于让我...
that ain't nothin' compared to how pissed off I am at him...

931
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,530
和这杂种呆在一块火大
for puttin' me in the same room as that bastard.

932
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:46,160
看到我都忍受了些什么吗  艾迪
You see what I've been puttin' up with Eddie?

933
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:50,210
我他妈的走进来让这些家伙留下来
I fuckin' walked in here I told these guys about stayin' put.

934
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,350
白先生掏出枪来指着我的脸
Mr. White whips out his gun he's stickin' it in my face...

935
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:58,220
叫我混蛋  说他要干掉我
callin' me a motherfucker sayin' he's gonna blow me away...

936
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:00,550
然后不停地说废话
and blah blah blah blah blah.

937
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:02,840
是他让行动变成了射击派对
He's the reason the joint turned into a shootin' spree.

938
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:06,650
你他妈的哑巴了  
What are you a fuckin' silent partner?

939
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,030
告诉他
Tell him!

940
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:11,030
他在店子里发疯  但现在看来很正常
He went crazy in the store but he seems all right now.

941
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,100
他当时做的就是...
This is what he was doin': bam bam...

942
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,440
没错
Yeah bam bam bam bam bam.

943
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,960
我叫他们别碰该死的报警器  可他们不听
I told 'em not to touch the fuckin' alarm they did.

944
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,400
如果他们照我说的做
If they hadn't have done what I told 'em not to do

945
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,090
他们就不会死
they'd still be alive.

946
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:32,220
他妈的英雄
My fuckin' hero.

947
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,400
谢谢
Thanks.

948
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:39,500
那就是你疯狂大屠杀的借口  
That's your excuse for going on a kill-crazy rampage?

949
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,700
我不喜欢报警器  白先生
I don't like alarms Mr. White.

950
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,560
谁留下来看着这个警察有什么关系  
What does it matter who stays with the cop?

951
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,750
不能放他走  他能认出我们
We ain't lettin' him go. He's seen everybody.

952
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,670
我谁也没看见
I haven't been looking at you guys.

953
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,180
他妈的闭嘴  伙计
Shut the fuck up man!

954
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:55,960
关键在于  不该把他
You guys should never have taken him

955
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,290
从行李箱弄出来
outta the trunk in the first place.

956
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:01,370
-我们想找出谁是内奸  -没有什么他妈的内奸
-We tried to find out about the setup. -There is no fuckin' setup!

957
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,230
现在听我说
Now here's the news!

958
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,340
金  你留下来照看他们两个
Blondie you stay here take care of these two!

959
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,720
白和粉  和我一起走  如果乔...
White and Pink you come with me 'cause if Joe gets here...

960
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,990
看到外面停着那么多车
and he sees all these cars parked outside...

961
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,570
我发誓他对谁都不会有什么好脸色
I swear to you he's gonna be just as mad at me as he is at you.

962
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:16,230
没问题  我们走吧
Fine. Let's go.

963
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:38,950
总算清静了
Alone at last.

964
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,220
猜猜怎么着
Guess what.

965
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,280
我想我把车停在禁区了
I think I'm parked in the red zone.

966
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:13,390
我们说到哪了  
Now where were we?

967
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:18,210
我告诉你  我对他妈的内奸一无所知
I told you I don't know anything about any fuckin' setup.

968
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,760
我加入警队只有八个月
I've been on the force for only eight months.

969
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:23,710
他们不会告诉我任何事
They don't tell me anything.

970
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:28,590
没人跟我说过  你用尽方法折磨我也没用
Nobody tells me shit. You can torture me all you want.

971
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:30,970
折磨你  好主意
Torture you? That's a good...

972
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:34,170
这是个好主意  我喜欢它
That's a good idea. I like that one yeah.

973
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,800
你的老板都说了没什么内奸
Even your boss said there wasn't a setup.

974
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:43,500
-我的什么  -你的老板
-My what? -Your boss.

975
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,560
抱歉  伙计
Excuse me pal.

976
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,540
有件事你得弄明白  我没什么老板
One thing I wanna make clear to you: I don't have a boss.

977
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,750
没人能对我指手划脚  懂吗  
Nobody tells me what to do. You understand?

978
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:56,380
听到我的话了吗  狗娘养的
You hear what I said you son of a bitch?

979
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,530
好的  好的  好的  你没有老板
All right all right all right you don't have a boss.

980
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,730
他妈的真够脏
Get that fuckin' shit off.

981
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:16,040
听着  我不会再跟你废话  明白吗  
Look I'm not gonna bullshit you okay?

982
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:20,110
我不会真的在乎你知道还是不知道
I don't really give a good fuck what you know or don't know...

983
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,840
但我会折磨你
but I'm gonna torture you anyway...

984
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:27,490
不管怎样
regardless.

985
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:29,530
不是为了要知道什么
Not to get information.

986
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,210
只是为了寻开心...
It's amusing to me...

987
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:36,700
而折磨一个警察
to torture a cop.

988
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,400
你想说什么都行  因为我早都听过了
You can say anything you want because I've heard it all before.

989
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,400
你能做的只有...
All you can do is...

990
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,280
祈求快点死去...
pray for a quick death...

991
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:49,930
总之...
which...

992
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:53,480
你将求死不能
you ain't gonna get.

993
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,510
天啊
Oh God.

994
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:22,660
你听过K・比利的"70年代超级声"吗  
You ever listen to K・BILLY's "Super Sounds of the '70s"?

995
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:28,440
那是我最喜欢的节目
It's my personal favorite.

996
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,970
艾根和莱佛蒂像"偷来的车轮"一样
Joe Egan and Gerry Rafferty were

997
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:39,190
是知名的歌唱组合
a duo known as Stealer's Wheel...

998
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:43,430
他们录制"最爱泡泡糖"这张专辑时...
when they recorded this Dylanesque pop bubble-gum favorite...

999
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:46,640
是1974年四月
from April of 1974.

1000
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,690
曾升到排行榜第五位...
That reached up to number five...

1001
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:52,070
就像七零年代  在"70年代超级声"的延续
as K-BILLY's "Super Sounds of the '70s" continues.

1002
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,250
别动
Hold still.

1003
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:45,460
别动  该死的
Hold still you fuck.

1004
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,310
这也没什么不好是吗  
Was that good for you too?

1005
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,900
嘿  怎么回事  
Hey what's goin' on?

1006
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:12,420
你听到了吗  
You hear that?

1007
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,320
哪也别去  我等会回来
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

1008
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:11,960
别  停下  停下
Don't! Stop! Stop!

1009
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:16,280
-什么  怎么了  -别这么做
-What? What's the matter? -Don't do this.

1010
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:19,490
那么就烧一点点  
That burn a little bit?

1011
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:22,000
不  停下
Don't! Stop!

1012
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:26,700
求求你停下
Please stop.

1013
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,960
停下  停下
Just stop. Stop.

1014
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,970
我跟你说  别  求你了
Just talk to me. Don't. Please.

1015
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:32,680
别烧我  求你了
Don't burn me please.

1016
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:39,440
我对你们一无所知
I don't know anything about any of you fucking guys.

1017
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,520
我什么都不会说
I'm not gonna say anything.

1018
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:44,940
不  求你了  不
No! Please no.

1019
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,490
-你说完了吗  -停下
-You all through? -Stop!

1020
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:47,680
说完了吗  
You all through?

1021
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:51,190
求你了  我家里还有个孩子
Please. I got a little kid at home.

1022
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:53,050
完了吗  
You all done?

1023
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:55,030
-不要  -点火了
-Don't! -Have some fire.

1024
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:01,090
哦  妈的
Oh shit.

1025
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,620
嘿  你
Hey you.

1037
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,530
弗兰克・费切蒂...

1038
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,420
大概五个月前向我们介绍过
introduced us about five months ago.

1039
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,840
我记不太清了

1044
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,260
我不知该怎么对你说  马文
I don't know what to tell you Marvin.

1045
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:51,510

1046
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:56,450
那该死的变态

01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,450
那该死的杂种
That fuckin' bastard!

1048
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:04,760
马文  你得撑住
Marvin I need you to hold on.

1049
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:07,790
警察一直在另一个街区等候行动
There's cops waiting to move a block away.

1050
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,930
他们在他妈的等什么  
What the fuck are they waiting for?

1051
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,210
这个该死的家伙  他弄伤了我的脸
This fuckin' guy he slashes my face...

1052
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:17,800
还他妈的割掉了我的耳朵
and cuts my fuckin' ear off!

1053
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:20,080
我他妈的被毁了容
I'm fuckin' deformed!

1054
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:21,780
去你妈的
Fuck you!

1055
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:25,120
我他妈的都快死了
I'm fuckin' dyin' here!

1056
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:27,290
我他妈的要死了
I'm fuckin' dyin'!

1057
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:39,660
在乔・卡伯特出现之前他们不会行动
They're not to make a move 'til Joe Cabot shows up.

1058
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,590
我是被派来抓他的
I was sent in to get him.

1059
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:44,300
懂吗  
All right?

1060
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:47,250
你也听到了  他正在赶来
You heard 'em. They said he's on his way.

1061
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:49,780
别对我发火  马文
Don't pussy out on me now Marvin.

1062
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,010
我们只要呆在这继续流血...
We're just gonna sit here and bleed...

1063
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:57,480
等乔・卡伯特  把他那该死的脑袋伸进来
'til Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.

1064
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,210
橙先生

1065
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,540
向这个"自己人"问好吧
Say hello to a motherfucker who's inside.

1066
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,430
卡伯特接了个买卖  他想要我加入
Cabot's doing a job. He wants me on the team.

1067
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:25,970
这最好不是个玩笑
This better not be a joke.

1068
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,670
不是玩笑  我混进去了  取得了他的信任
This ain't a joke. I'm in. I'm up his ass.

1069
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:40,240
"好家伙"艾迪告诉我乔想见我
Nice Guy Eddie tells me Joe wants to meet me.

1070
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:44,210
他让我等一个电话
He says I should just wait for a phone call.

1071
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:46,580
等了三天后
After waiting three days

1072
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:48,630
昨晚他打电话给我说乔准备好了
he calls me last night and says Joe's ready.

1073
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:51,750
-他十五分钟后来接我  -谁接的你  
-He'll pick me up in 15 minutes. -Who picked you up?

1074
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:54,460
-"好家伙"  我们去了一家酒吧  -哪家  
-Nice Guy. We get to a bar. -What bar?

1075
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:56,110
皮特开的那家
Smokey Pete's in Gardena.

1076
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:57,750
我们到了那...
We get there...

1077
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:00,750
见到乔和一个叫白先生的人
and I meet Joe and a guy named Mr. White.

1078
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,810
是假名  我叫橙先生
Phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.

1079
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:05,610
-橙先生  -橙先生
-Mr. Orange? -Mr. Orange.

1080
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:08,810
那么  橙先生
Okay Mr. Orange.

1081
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:12,510
-你以前从没见过那混蛋  -谁  白先生吗  
-You ever see this motherfucker before? -Who? Mr. White?

1082
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:14,290
对  白先生
Yes. Mr. White.

1083
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:17,430
不  他不是卡伯特的手下
No. He ain't one of Cabot's men either.

1084
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:19,800
他是从外地来的
He's gotta be from out of town.

1085
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:22,150
-乔和他很熟  -你怎么能断定  
-Joe knows him good. -How can you tell?

1086
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,210
从他们说话的样子能断定他们是朋友
The way they talk. You can tell they're buddies.

1087
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,420
-你们聊过吗  -我和乔吗  
-You two talk? -Me and Joe?

1088
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:29,510
白先生
Mr. White.

1089
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:31,130
-一点点  -说些什么  
-A little. -About what?

1090
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:33,690
-"酿酒者"  -"密尔沃基酿酒者"队  
The Brewers. Milwaukee Brewers?

1091
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:36,880
他们头天晚上赢了比赛  他赢了些钱
They won the night before. He made some money off them.

1092
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:40,140
很好  如果他是"酿酒者"队的球迷  
Good. If this crook's a Brewers fan

1093
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:41,700
他就是从威斯康辛来的
he's gotta be from Wisconsin.

1094
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,650
我敢和你打赌...
And I'll bet you everything...

1095
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,800
密尔沃基肯定有这个白先生的资料
they got a sheet in Milwaukee on this Mr. White's ass.

1096
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:52,130
所以我想要你去看看密尔沃基的档案
So I want you to go through everybody in Milwaukee...

1097
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:55,700
看看所有有关武装抢劫的资料  找出他的名字
with a history of armed robbery and put a name to the face.

1098
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,300
-干得不错  弗雷蒂  -谢谢  伙计
-Nice work Freddy. -Thank you my man.

1099
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:02,030
-麦克那个人怎么样  -不错
-How was Long Beach Mike's referral? -Perfect.

1100
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:04,200
他一直都在帮我
His backing me up went a long way.

1101
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,090
我跟他们说我俩是牌友
I told them I played poker with him.

1102
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:09,330
"好家伙"调查过之后说没问题
Nice Guy checked it out and said it was A-okay.

1103
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:12,340
说我是个在行的盗贼  我没多说什么
Said I was a good thief I didn't rattle...

1104
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:14,790
然后我开始准备行动
and that I was ready to move.

1105
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:17,510
他是个好人  没他我混不进去
He's a good guy. I wouldn't be inside without him.

1106
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,440
不  不  不...
No no no

1107
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,670
长滩麦克不是你的朋友
Long Beach Mike is not your friend.

1108
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:24,110
长滩麦克是个他妈的人渣
Long Beach Mike is a fucking scumbag.

1109
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:26,350
他出卖了他的朋友
He's selling out his friends.

1110
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,180
他就是那种好法
That's how nice he fuckin' is.

1111
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:31,280
我会小心他的
I'll take care of his ass...

1112
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:35,120
你做事的时候要注意撇开那个下流坯
but you get that scumbag out of mind and take care of business.

1113
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,870
我是这样做的
Gone.

1114
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,570
用那个"马桶故事"吗  
Use the commode story?

1115
01:06:44,810 --> 01:06:48,040
-什么"马桶故事"  -是个电影情节  记住它
-What's the commode story? -It's a scene. Memorize it.

1116
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:53,320
-是什么  -做卧底就要像白兰度
-A what? -Undercover cops gotta be Brando.

1117
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:56,630
得做个好演员  表现得自然逼真
To do this job you gotta be a great actor naturalistic.

1118
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:59,450
要表现得无懈可击
You gotta be naturalistic as hell.

1119
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:04,400
如果你是个糟糕的演员  事情就会干砸了
If you're a bad actor that's bullshit in this job.

1120
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:05,960
什么乱七八糟的  
What is this?

1121
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:08,890
是关于毒品交易的趣事
That's an amusing anecdote about a drug deal.

1122
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:11,560
当你工作时
Something funny that

1123
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:15,210
发生的一些趣事
happened to you while you were doing a job.

1124
01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:18,690
我要全记住吗  这些狗屁足有四页
I gotta memorize all this? There's four pages of this shit.

1125
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:21,450
就当它是个笑话
Think about it like it's a joke.all right?

1126
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,660
记住最重要的  其余的你看着办
Memorize what's important. The rest you make your own.all right?

1127
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:26,820
-你会讲笑话对吧  -不会
-You can tell a joke can't you? -No

1128
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,620
就当你是东・瑞科斯在说笑话  行吗  
Well pretend you're Don Rickles... and tell a joke all right?

1129
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:34,620
关键是你要记住细节
The things you gotta remember are the details.

1130
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,720
这对你的故事有帮助
The details sell your story.

1131
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:39,810
故事场景是在一间男厕所
This particular story takes place in a men's room.

1132
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,530
你得知道所有的细节
You gotta know all the details...

1133
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:46,390
不管他们用纸巾还是暖风机把手弄干
whether they got paper towels or a blower to dry your hands.

1134
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:50,130
你得知道隔间是否有门
You gotta know if the stalls ain't got no doors or not.

1135

得知道是否有透明皂
You gotta know if they got liquid soap

1136
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:53,320
或者粉红色的狗屁颗粒...

1137
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:55,380
那种中学里用的东西

1138
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:58,370
你得知道是否有热水  臭不臭...
You gotta know if they got hot water or not if it stinks...

1139
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:01,760
脏不脏  是否有缺德的杂种...
if some nasty lowlife scum-ridden motherfucker...

1140
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:04,300
拉肚子弄得马桶上到处都是
sprayed diarrhea all over one of the bowls.

1141
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:07,730
你得知道有关马桶的每个细节
You gotta know every detail there is to know about this commode.

1142
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:12,650
你得告诉他们这些全是你的经历
What you gotta do is take all them details and make 'em your own.

1143
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:16,630
你这样做的时候  想要记住这是你的故事...
While you're doing that remember that this story is about you...

1144
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:19,950
和你是怎么接受这些事情的
and how you perceived the events that went down.

1145
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,010
唯一的办法就是...
The only way to do that...

1146
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:25,000
不停地说它
is keep sayin' it...

1147
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,490
一遍又一遍地说
and sayin' it and sayin' it.

1148
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:35,700
1986洛杉矶大麻缺货时
This is during the L.A. marijuana drought 1986.

1149
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:39,210
我一直和那些人有联系  有点疯狂...
I still had a connection which was insane 'cause...

1150
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,510
因为你根本弄不到货
you couldn't get any weed anywhere then.

1151
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,950
总之  我和圣克鲁斯的一个家伙有联系
Anyway I had a connection with this hippie chick in Santa Cruz...

1152
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:49,010
我的朋友都知道这事
and all my friends knew it.

1153
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:51,690
他们打电话给我说"嘿  弗雷蒂..."
They call me and say "Hey Freddy..."

1154
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:55,520
我说"嘿  伙计"
I say "Hey dude.

1155
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,750
你弄到了吗  能不能给我也来点  
You gettin' some? Can you get some for me too? "

1156
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:04,500
他们知道我有货  所以要我替他们买点
They knew I still smoked so they asked me to buy some for them.

1157
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,140
所以...
It got to be...

1158
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:13,990
每次我买大麻时
Every time I bought some weed

1159
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:16,090
都要替四五个人带点
I was buyin' for four or five people.

1160
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:20,560
最后我说  去他妈的  我能靠这婊子发财了
Finally I said fuck this shit. I'm makin' this bitch rich.

1161
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:24,280
她甚至不用见那些人
She didn't even have to meet these people.

1162
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:26,340
所有的事都由我来办
I was doing all the work.

1163
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:30,650
我就像得了痔疮一样坐不稳当  电话不停地打来
That got to be a pain in the ass people calling all the time.

1164
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:34,470
甚至我租盒带子来看都会被打断六次
I couldn't even rent a tape without six fuckin' interruptions.

1165
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:36,680
"你下次去弄货是什么时候"
"When's the next time you're gettin' some? "

1166
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,130
混蛋  让我看完这片子
"Motherfucker I'm tryin' to watch The Lost Boys.

1167
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:41,150
"有货我会通知你"
When I get some I'll call you."

1168
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,660
那些瘾君子都闻讯而来
Then these rink-a-dink potheads come by.

1169
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:47,200
都是我的朋友熟人  但...
They're my friends and everything but still...

1170
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:50,600
我花六十美元一袋买来  他们却不想整袋买下
I got it laid out in 60-dollar bags they don't want 60 dollars worth.

1171
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:54,040
他们只要十美元的货  拆开卖可不容易
They want ten dollars' worth and breaking it up wasn't easy.

1172
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:57,730
我根本不知道十美元能买多少
I don't even know what ten dollars' worth looks like.

1173
01:09:58,110 --> 01:10:00,030
那情形真是头疼
This was a very weird situation.

1174
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:03,420
回想起86年...
Remember back in '86...

1175
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:05,850
货真叫他妈紧缺
there was a major fuckin' drought.

1176
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:07,400
谁都没货
Nobody had anything.

1177
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:10,710
大家只好抽树叶过瘾
People were livin' on resin smokin' the wood in their pipes.

1178
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:14,670
有个小妞弄到了一些货  求我替她卖掉
This chick had a bunch and she's beggin' me to sell it.

1179
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:17,710
我说我不会像乔那样抽太多成
So I told her I wasn't gonna be Joe the pot man anymore...

1180
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:21,650
但我得拿点卖给我的朋友
but I would take a little bit and sell it to my close friends.

1181
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,290
她同意了  我们像谈好的那样...
She agreed and we kept the same arrangement as before...

1182
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:26,330
我免费得一成...
ten percent and free pot for me...

1183
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,330
如果我能帮她的话
if I helped her that weekend.

1184
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:30,110
她要卖掉大麻
She was sellin' a brick of weed

1185
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:31,640
却又不想一个人去
and didn't wanna go to the buy alone.

1186
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:35,200
通常是她兄弟和她一起  但他出了麻烦
Her brother usually goes with her but he's in County unexpectedly.

1187
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:38,250
-什么麻烦  -他的驾照在审核期
What for? His traffic tickets gone to warrant.

1188
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:42,140
他们拦住他发现了这个问题  把他拘留了
They stopped him found warrants on him took him to County.

1189
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:45,180
她不想一个人带着大麻到处走
She doesn't wanna walk around alone with all that weed.

1190
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:49,010
我不想干  我对此有很坏的预感
I don't wanna do this.I have a very bad feeling about it.

1191
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,120
她一直求我  求我
She keeps asking me asking me.

1192
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:54,110
最后我答应了  因为实在受不了
Finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of hearing it.

1193
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,440
-于是我们去车站  -等等
-So we go to the train station... -Wait.

1194
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:59,510
你把大麻带在身上去车站  
You're goin' to the train station with the weed on ya?

1195
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,780
买家想在那交易
The guy needed it right away.

1196
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,180
总之  我们去了车站
Anyway we get to the train station...

1197
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,200
然后等着那家伙
and we're waitin' for the guy.

1198
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,840
我把大麻放在一个手提袋里
I'm carryin' the weed in a carry-on bag.

1199
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:13,530
我要去撒尿  所以我跟她说我要去厕所
I gotta take a piss so I tell her I'm goin' to the boy's room.

1200
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:20,840
我走进厕所时猜猜谁在那  
So I walk into the men's room and who's standing there?

1201
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:25,920
四个洛杉矶警察和一条德国牧羊犬
Four Los Angeles County sheriffs and a German shepherd.

1202
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:31,580
-他们在等着你  -不  他们只是在聊天
-They're waitin' for you? -No they're just talkin'.

1203
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:34,710
我走进去时  他们停了下来
When I walked in they all stopped talkin'...

1204
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,180
然后看着我
and they looked at me.

1205
01:11:37,370 --> 01:11:40,060
真紧张  真他妈的紧张
That's hard. That's a fuckin' hard situation.

1206
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:42,800
德国牧羊犬开始叫
German shepherd starts barking.

1207
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:46,110
它向着我叫
He's barkin' at me.

1208
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:48,740
我是说  它显然是在冲着我叫
I mean it's obvious he's barkin' at me.

1209
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:52,560
我所有的感觉神经都僵硬了
Every nerve ending all of my senses

1210
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,370
血在血管里尖叫
the blood in the veins was screamin

1211
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:58,430
"离开这  伙计  放弃  从这离开"
"Take off man. Just bail. Get the fuck outta there."

1212
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:02,460
我吓出一身冷汗  像当头淋下来一桶水
Panic hits me like a bucket of water. Bam! Right in the face.

1213
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:05,170
我浑身都湿透了
I'm drenched in panic

1214
01:12:05,170 --> 01:12:07,540
那些警察看着我意识到有问题
and these cops are lookin' at me and they know it.

1215
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:11,150
他们能闻得到  就像该死的狗能闻到一样
They can smell it sure as that fuckin' dog can.

1216
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:13,180
能闻出我身上的味
They can smell it on me.

1217
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:15,630
闭嘴
Shut up.

1218
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:20,050
总之  我拔出枪来
So anyway I got my gun drawn.

1219
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:23,070
我指着那家伙告诉他
I point it at this guy and I tell him...

1220
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:25,600
"别动  他妈的别动"
"Freeze. Don't fuckin' move."

1221
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:28,610
这个小白痴看着我说...
This little idiot's looking right at me and saying...

1222
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:30,550
"我知道  我知道"
"I know I know."

1223
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:34,000
但他的右手却偷偷伸向手套箱
But meanwhile his right hand is creepin' toward the glove box.

1224
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:38,850
我对他大吼  混蛋  我会一枪崩了你
I scream at him "Asshole! I'm gonna blow you away right now!

1225
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:41,130
"把手放到仪表板上"
Put your hands on the dash."

1226
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:44,180
他还是看着我  点着头
He's still looking at me nodding his head.

1227
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:46,620
"我知道  伙计  我知道"
"I know buddy I know."

1228
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,370
同时他的手却仍在伸向手套箱
Meanwhile his hand is still going for the glove box.

1229
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,180
然后我说
And I said...

1230
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:56,040
"伙计  我会从你的脸上射进去...
"Buddy I'm gonna shoot you in the face...

1231
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:58,880
"如果你不把手放上来的话"
if you don't put your hands up."

1232
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:04,390
接着那家伙的女朋友  一个非常性感的亚洲婊子
Then this guy's girlfriend this real sexy Oriental bitch...

1233
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:07,770
她开始向他尖叫  你在干什么  
she starts screaming at him: "Chuck what are you doin'?

1234
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:11,100
"听警察的话  把手放到仪表板上"
Listen to the officer! Put your hands on the dash!"

1235
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:15,370
然后那家伙  猛然抽出手来放到了仪表板上
So then the guy snaps out of it and puts his hands on the dash.

1236
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:16,960
他拿了什么  
What was he goin' for?

1237
01:13:17,170 --> 01:13:19,250
他该死的驾照
His fucking registration.

1238
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:22,170
-你在开玩笑  -不  伙计
-You're kidding. -No man!

1239
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:24,050
那个白痴不知道
Stupid citizen doesn't know

1240
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:25,790
他差点就把命送掉了
how close he came to gettin blown away.

1241
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,400
只差这么一点
That close man.

1242
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:02,900
你知道应付那种局面
You knew how to handle that situation.

1243
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:05,880
尿湿了裤子时  跳到水里游泳就是
You shit your pants dive in and swim.

1244
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:10,500
再说点卡伯特的事
Tell me more about Cabot.

1245
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,420
我不知道
I don't know.

1246
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:14,480
他是个很有趣的人
He's a cool guy.

1247
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:18,820
很有趣  是个有趣的家伙
He's funny. He's a funny guy.

1248
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:21,810
你记得神奇四侠吗  
You remember the Fantastic Four?

1249
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:24,830
当然  有那个隐身的骚货...

1250
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:26,840
还有霹雳火  对吗

1251
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:29,320
石头人

1252
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:31,220
那混蛋...
Motherfucker...

1253
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:33,260
看起来就像石头人
Iooks just like the Thing.

1254
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:39,920
嘿  表演时间

01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,890
拿好你的夹克  我在车上等你
Grab your jacket. I'm parked outside.

1256
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:44,840
我就下来

1257
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,620
他就下来
He'll be right down.

1258
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:09,700
现在别惹我
Don't pussy out on me now.

1259
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,720
他们不知道
They don't know.

1260
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:14,010
他们什么都不知道
They don't know shit.

1261
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:17,170
你不会受伤  你是他妈的传奇人物
You're not gonna get hurt. You're fuckin' Baretta.

1262
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:20,670
他们相信了所有的假话  因为你非常棒
They believe every fuckin' word 'cause you're super cool.

1263
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:29,580
我们的朋友来了
There goes our boy.

1264
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,710
这家伙脑子里  得有块城砖一样大的石头
The guy has to have rocks in his head the size of Gibraltar...

1265
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:34,300
才会做卧底
to work undercover.

1266
01:16:34,410 --> 01:16:37,230
-你想来点吗  -是的  给我那只熊爪
-You want one of these? -Yeah give me the bear claw.

1267
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:55,290
我知道我在说什么
I know what I'm talking about.

1268
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:57,990
黑种女人和白种女人不尽相同
Black women ain't the same as white women.

1269
01:16:58,220 --> 01:16:59,550
有些微的区别
There's a slight difference.

1270
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:02,330
非常有趣  你知道我的意思

1271
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:04,220
白种女人能忍受的
What a white bitch will put up with

1272
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:05,840
黑种女人一分钟也受不了
a black bitch wouldn't for a minute.

1273
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:08,730
如果你越过她们的底线  她们会让你很狼狈
If you cross their line they fuck you up.

1274
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:11,410
我同意粉的说法
I gotta go along with Pink on that.

1275
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:14,250
那么  专家先生  如果真是这样...
Okay Mr. Expert if this is such a truism...

1276
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,620
为什么我认识的每个黑鬼
why is it that every nigger I know

1277
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:18,530
都把他们的女人像垃圾一样看待  
treats his woman like a piece of shit?

1278
01:17:18,610 --> 01:17:22,300
我敢说同样是那些  在外面趾高气扬的黑鬼...
I'll bet those same niggers who show their ass in public...

1279
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:25,320
他们的母狗回到家时  他们就会战战兢兢
when their bitches get 'em home they chill the fuck out.

1280
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,480
-那些家伙不会  -哦  会的  他们也会
-Not these guys. -Oh yeah. Those guys too.

1281
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:30,620
跟你们说个故事
Tell you guys a story.

1282
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:33,080
老爹的夜总会里

1283
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,380
有个叫伊露斯的黑人女侍

1287
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:46,790
从拉达那来的
She's from Ladora Heights.

1288
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:49,260
拉达那高地是黑人的比华利山
Ladora Heights. The black Beverly Hills.

1289
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:52,630
那不是黑人的比华利山
It's not the black Beverly Hills.

1290
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:55,250
那是黑人的佛得角
It's the black Palos Verdes.

1291
01:17:55,530 --> 01:17:57,190
总之...
Anyway...

1292
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:01,560
E小姐  她是个迷死人的女人
Lady E she was a man-eater-upper. Un-fuckin'-believable.

1293
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:06,430
每个曾见过她的男人  至少要向她"起立致敬"一次
Every guy who ever saw her had to jack off to her at least once.

1294
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,540
知道她看起来像谁吗  克里斯蒂・萝芙
You know who she looked like? Christie Love.

1295
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:11,570

1296
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:13,930
关于一个黑人女警的

1297
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:16,910
她总是说"你被逮捕了  宝贝"
She always used to say "You're under arrest sugar! "

1298
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:22,090
克里斯蒂・萝芙是谁演的  -佩恩・格莉尔
-Who played Christie Love? -Pam Grier.

1299
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,900
不是佩恩・格莉尔  她演的是另一部片子
No it wasn't Pam Grier. Pam Grier was the other one.

1300
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:26,890
格莉尔是演电影的...
Pam Grier did the film.

1301
01:18:27,130 --> 01:18:31,510
不会演电视  萝芙只是像她而已
Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show without Pam Grier.

1302
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:34,850
-那是谁演的萝芙  -我怎么知道  
-So who was Christie Love? -How should I know?

1303
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:36,900
好极了  我该头疼了
Great. Now I'm totally fuckin' tortured.

1304
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:40,210
不管是谁  总之很像伊露斯
Whoever it was she looked exactly like Elois.

1305
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:41,790
安妮・弗朗西斯
Anne Francis.

1306
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:44,460
不  那片子叫"甜蜜西部"
No. That was Honey West.

1307
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:46,340
安妮・弗朗西斯是白人
Anne Francis is white.

1308
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:50,580
我在试着讲故事  她看起来的确像伊露斯
I'm tryin' to tell a story here. She looked exactly like Elois.

1309
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:53,290
有天晚上我们去夜总会
We come into the club one night...

1310
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:55,320
那有个男侍叫卡洛斯
and there's Carlos the bartender.

1311
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:58,500
墨西哥人  是我的一个朋友
He's a wetback. He's a friend of mine.

1312
01:18:58,830 --> 01:19:01,290
我对他说"卡洛斯  今晚E小姐上哪了"
I says to him "Carlos where's Lady E tonight? "

1313
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:04,340
显然E小姐...
Apparently Lady E...

1314
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:07,670
嫁给了一个窝囊废  一个真正的畜牲
was married to real piece of dog shit a real animal.

1315
01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:10,020
他对她很糟糕
He used to do things to her.

1316
01:19:10,270 --> 01:19:12,090
例如呢  他都干了什么  
Like what? What would he do?

1317
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:13,870
狠狠揍她  
Beat her up?

1318
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,750
我不知道  反正他对她不好
I don't know. He just did things.

1319
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:20,470
总之  有天晚上她干了件有趣的事
So anyway one night she plays it real cool.

1320
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:22,960
她等到那家伙喝醉
She waits for him to get drunk.

1321
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:25,910
在睡椅上睡着了之后
He falls asleep on the fuckin' couch.

1322
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:30,260
她偷偷摸过去在他的老二上涂上胶水
She sneaks up on him puts some glue on his dick...

1323
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,580
然后粘在他肚子上
and glues his dick to his belly.

1324
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:35,490
我的天
Jesus Christ!

1325
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,320
我是说真的  伙计  非常认真
I'm serious man. I'm dead serious.

1326
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:41,700
他们不得不叫医生来替他慢慢割开
They had to call the paramedics to cut the prick loose.

1327
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:44,990
他是不是非常恼火  
Was he all pissed off?

1328
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:49,170
如果你非得他妈的倒立着撒尿
How would you feel if you had to

1329
01:19:49,170 --> 01:19:51,200
你会有什么感觉  
do a fuckin' handstand to take a piss?

1330
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:59,460
你们喜欢说笑话然后傻笑取乐是吗  
You guys like to tell jokes and giggle and kid around huh?

1331
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:02,450
笑得像一群学校里的傻妞
Giggling like a bunch of girls in the schoolyard.

1332
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,490
让我说个笑话吧
Well let me tell a joke.

1333
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:08,210
五个人坐在候审室里
Five guys sittin' in a bullpen...

1334
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,190
在圣昆廷
San Quentin...

1335
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:13,150
想知道是怎么到这来的
wonderin' how the fuck they got there.

1336
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:16,540
我们做错了什么  我们忘做了什么  
"What did we do wrong? What shouldn't we have done?

1337
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,600
"这是你的错  他的错- -"
It's your fault his fault--"

1338
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,440
全是些废话
All that bullshit.

1339
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:22,270
终于有个人说
Finally somebody says...

1340
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:24,550
等等
"Wait a minute.

1341
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:26,620
我们在计划行动时
While we were planning this caper...

1342
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,210
"只是在无所事事地说笑话"
we just sat around tellin' fuckin' jokes."

1343
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:31,050
明白了吗  
Got the message?

1344
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:35,240
我不是要教训你们
I don't mean to holler at ya.

1345
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:39,830
等行动结束...我相信行动一定会成功
When this caper's over and I'm sure it'll be successful...

1346
01:20:40,130 --> 01:20:43,270
我们可以去夏威夷  我会和你们一起大笑
we'll go down to Hawaiian lslands I'll laugh with all of youse.

1347
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,450
让你们看看我另外的一面
Find me a different character down there.

1348
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:47,880
现在是办正事的时候
Right now it's a matter of business.

1349
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:51,440
除了艾迪和我
With the exception of Eddie and myself...

1350
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:53,300
你们已经知道...
who you already know...

1351
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:56,170
我们在这次行动中要使用化名
we're gonna be using aliases on this job.

1352
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,740
我们希望...
Under no circumstances...

1353
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:01,960
你们任何人彼此交谈时  都不要...
do we want any one of you to relate to each other...

1354
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:04,300
使用你们的真名
by your Christian names.

1355
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:08,680
而且我也不希望  有任何人谈论自己的私事
And I don't want any talk about yourself personally.

1356
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:12,680
包括你去过哪  你妻子的名字...
That includes where you been your wife's name...

1357
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:14,760
平时你干些什么...
where you might've done time...

1358
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:18,580
或是你在圣彼得堡抢过哪家银行
or a bank maybe you robbed in St. Petersburg.

1359
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:22,590
如果忍不住  我希望你们只谈论...
All I want you guys to talk about if you have to...

1360
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:25,310
你们想要做的事
is what you're gonna do.

1361
01:21:25,570 --> 01:21:27,590
将要做的事
That should do it.

1362
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,050
这是你们的名字
These are your names...

1363
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:33,040
褐先生  白先生...
Mr. Brown Mr. White...

1364
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:35,590
金先生  蓝先生...
Mr. Blonde Mr. Blue...

1365
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:37,830
橙先生和粉先生
Mr. Orange and Mr. Pink.

1366
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:41,510
-为什么我是粉先生  -因为你是个同性恋  行吗  
-Why am I Mr. Pink? -Because you're a faggot! All right?

1367
01:21:43,450 --> 01:21:45,790
-自己选颜色不行吗  -不行
-Why can't we pick our own colors? -No way.

1368
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:48,520
不行  试过一次  行不通
No way. Tried it once. It doesn't work.

1369
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,000
有四个人为了做黑先生动手打架
You get four guys all fightin' over who gets to be Mr. Black.

1370
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:55,470
他们互不相识  所以没人想退让
They don't know each other so nobody wants to back down.

1371
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:57,950
不行  我来定  你是粉先生
No way. I pick. You're Mr. Pink.

1372
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:00,150
该庆幸你不是黄先生
Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.

1373
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,610
但是褐先生  和屎先生很接近
But Mr. Brown that's too close to Mr. Shit.

1374
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,640
粉先生听来像"女阴"先生
Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy.

1375
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,580
紫先生怎么样  
How about Mr. Purple?

1376
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:09,630
听起来不错  我要做紫先生
That's sounds good. I'll be Mr. Purple.

1377
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:12,130
你不是紫先生
You're not Mr. Purple.

1378
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:16,390
另一个买卖有人叫紫先生了  你就叫粉先生
Some guy on some other job is Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink!

1379
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:18,330
谁会在乎你叫什么  
Who cares what your name is?

1380
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:20,210
你说得容易  你是白先生
Easy for you to say. You're Mr. White.

1381
01:22:20,210 --> 01:22:21,940
你有个听来很酷的名字
You have a cool-sounding name.

1382
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:25,720
如果你不介意叫粉先生  你愿意交换吗  
If it's no big deal to be Mr. Pink you wanna trade?

1383
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:28,590
不准私自交换
Nobody's tradin' with anybody.

1384
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:31,810
这不是他妈的市政讨论会  你知道的
This ain't a goddamn fuckin' city council meeting you know.

1385
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:35,400
听着  粉先生
Now listen up Mr. Pink.

1386
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:38,080
这件事上你有两条路可走
There's two ways you can go on this job...

1387
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:40,580
我的路或者那条公路
my way or the highway.

1388
01:22:40,850 --> 01:22:42,730
你选哪条  粉先生
What's it gonna be Mr. Pink?

1389
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:45,800
老天  他妈的忘了这些好了
Jesus Christ Joe. Fuckin' forget about it.

1390
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:49,140
这名字很衬我  我是粉先生  继续吧
It's beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink. Let's move on.

1391
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:52,150
我觉得高兴时自然会继续
I'll move on when I feel like it.

1392
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:55,180
你们都明白了吗  
Do all you guys got the goddamn message?

1393
01:22:56,930 --> 01:23:00,710
我扯着嗓子向你们喊叫  几乎都说不出话来了
I'm so goddamn mad hollerin' at you guys I can hardly talk.

1394
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:04,240
我们开始行动吧
Let's go to work.

1395
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:07,130
我们重复一次  你在哪  
Let's go over it. Where are you?

1396
01:23:07,410 --> 01:23:10,770
我站在外边守住门  不让任何人进出
I stand outside and guard the door.I don't let anybody go in or out.

1397
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,720
-褐先生  -他等在车里
-Mr. Brown. -He waits in the car.

1398
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:17,270
我给他信号  他就把车开到门口
I give him the signal he pulls up in front.

1399
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:19,600
金先生和蓝先生
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue.

1400
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:23,250
控制人群  他们控制顾客和店员
Crowd control. They handle the customers and the employees.

1401
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:26,540
-那个妞的屁股  -正好坐在我的老二上
-That girl's ass. -Sittin' right here on my dick.

1402
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,050
我和粉先生呢  
Myself and Mr. Pink?

1403
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:35,170
你们俩抓住经理让他给你们钻石
You two take the manager and make him give you the diamonds.

1404
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,450
我们的目标是钻石
We're there for those stones period.

1405
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:39,310
因为没有监视器添乱
Since no display cases are being

1406
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:40,990
不会有警报声
fucked with no alarms should go off.

1407
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:45,190
我们要在两分钟内出来  不能拖延一秒
We're out in two minutes not one second longer.

1408
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:49,330
如果经理不给你钻石怎么办  
What if the manager won't give you the diamonds?

1409
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:53,870
像这样的店铺都有保险
A store like this is insured up the ass.

1410
01:23:54,190 --> 01:23:56,910
无论你要什么他们都不会反抗
They're not supposed to give you any resistance whatsoever.

1411
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:58,990
如果有顾客或店员
If you get a customer or an employee

1412
01:23:58,990 --> 01:24:00,750
自以为是查尔斯・布朗森...
who thinks he's Charles Bronson...

1413
01:24:01,130 --> 01:24:03,210
把枪塞进他的鼻孔
smash their nose with your gun.

1414
01:24:03,390 --> 01:24:05,790
把他放倒在地上  任何人都会害怕
Drops him right to the floor. Everyone jumps.

1415
01:24:06,030 --> 01:24:08,760
他会跪在地上尖叫  鼻孔里鲜血直冒
He falls down screaming blood squirts out of his nose.

1416
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:11,760
搞定一个之后就没人敢再说废话
Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin' shit after that.

1417
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,380
也许有哪个母狗会跟你废话
Some bitch might talk shit to you.

1418
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:19,330
看她一眼  似乎接下来就轮到她  她就会闭上臭嘴
Give her a look like she's next. Watch her shut the fuck up.

1419
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:23,240
如果是经理  那就不同
If it's the manager that's different.

1420
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,600
经理懂得不要乱来
The managers know not to fuck around...

1421
01:24:25,850 --> 01:24:27,960
如果他不合作
so if he's giving you static...

1422
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:30,190
自以为是个真正的牛仔
he probably thinks he's a real cowboy

1423
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:32,160
那只好让这杂种吃点苦头
so you gotta that bastard in two.

1424
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:36,190
他不开口就切掉他一根手指
If he won't tell ya something cut off one of his fingers.

1425
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:39,540
小指  然后告诉他下一根是拇指
The little one. Then tell him his thumb's next.

1426
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:42,560
之后他会告诉你  他是否穿了女式内衣
After that he'll tell you if he wears ladies underwear.

1427
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:48,560
我饿了  去买个玉米卷
I'm hungry. Let's get a taco.

1428
01:25:04,290 --> 01:25:05,180
妈的
Fuck.

1429
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,400
老天
Jesus.

1430
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:27,680
我瞎了  伙计  我瞎了
I'm blind man. I'm fuckin' blind.

1431
01:25:27,950 --> 01:25:30,190
不  只不过是血流进了你的眼睛
No you just got blood in your eyes.

1432
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:44,740
他死了  
Is he dead?

1433
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:48,020
他是不是死了  
Did he die or not?

1434
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,680
我们走
Let's go.

1435
01:26:25,370 --> 01:26:27,610
停下  出来
Hold it! Get out!

1436
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:31,200
从他妈的车里出来
Get out of the fuckin' car!

1437
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:48,900
对不起  对不起  拉里
I'm sorry. I'm sorry Larry.

1438
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:53,370
真不敢相信她想杀了我  谁他妈会料到呢  
I can't believe she killed me. Who'd have fucking thought that?

1439
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:56,220
嘿  现在别说废话了
Hey just cancel that shit right now.

1440
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:59,230
你受了伤  伤得确实很重
You're hurt. You're hurt real fuckin' bad.

1441
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:01,070
但你不会死
But you ain't dying.

1442
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:05,260
我流出的这些血让我害怕  拉里
All this blood's scaring the shit out of me Larry.

1443
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,540
我快死了  我知道
I'm gonna die. I know it.

1444
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:45,110
他妈的怎么了  
What the fuck happened?

1445
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:47,170
他猛砍这警察的脸  割掉他的耳朵
He slashed the cop's face cut off his ear

1446
01:27:47,170 --> 01:27:49,060
还想活活烧他
and was gonna burn him alive.

1447
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,630
什么  我没听到
What? I didn't hear you.

1448
01:27:52,890 --> 01:27:54,170
我是说...
I said...

1449
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:57,550
金发疯了
Blonde went crazy.

1450
01:27:57,690 --> 01:28:00,220
他猛砍这警察的脸  割掉他的耳朵
He slashed the cop's face cut off his ear

1451
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:02,750
还想烧死他
and was gonna burn him alive.

1452
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:04,270
这个警察  
This cop?

1453
01:28:09,370 --> 01:28:11,350
他发疯了  就像这样子  
He went crazy? Something like that?

1454
01:28:11,610 --> 01:28:13,530
更坏还是更好  
Worse or better?

1455
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:16,790
艾迪  他想点火  伙计
Eddie he was pulling a burn man.

1456
01:28:18,150 --> 01:28:20,060
他想杀了那警察和我
He was gonna kill the cop and me.

1457
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,130
你们进来的时候
When you guys walked in

1458
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:24,740
他想杀了你们带着钻石逃跑
he was gonna kill you and run with the diamonds.

1459
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:25,770
我跟你说过什么  
What'd I tell ya?

1460
01:28:25,890 --> 01:28:29,310
那个变态的杂种是个冷血疯子
That sick piece of shit was a stone-cold psycho.

1461
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:32,640
你该问问那警察  而不是杀了他
You should've asked the cop not just killed him.

1462
01:28:32,930 --> 01:28:34,630
他用刀割他的时候说了
He talked about what he was gonna do when

1463
01:28:34,630 --> 01:28:36,320
他想干什么
he was slicing him up.

1464
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,660
我不相信
I don't buy it.

1465
01:28:39,810 --> 01:28:41,180
这没道理
Doesn't make sense.

1466
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:47,910
我他妈的全都相信
Makes perfect fuckin' sense to me.

1467
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:51,510
你没看到行动的时候他是怎么干的  我们看到过
You didn't see how he acted during the job. We did.

1468
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:53,830
他没说错  耳朵是割下来的
He's right. The ear's hacked off.

1469
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:58,020
让我再大声说一遍  因为我想弄清楚
Let me just say this out loud 'cause I wanna get this straight.

1470
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:00,980
你说金先生...
You're saying that Mr. Blonde...

1471
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:02,250
想杀了你...
was gonna kill you...

1472
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:05,430
然后在我们回来时干掉我们...
and then when we got back he was gonna kill us...

1473
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:07,490
带着钻石逃走
take the diamonds and scram.

1474
01:29:07,730 --> 01:29:10,710
我说得对不对  这是你的故事  
I'm right about that right? That's your story?

1475
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:13,360
我以我母亲的灵魂发誓...
I swear on my mother's soul...

1476
01:29:13,610 --> 01:29:15,070
就是这样
that's what happened.

1477
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:18,980
你杀死的这个人刚从监狱放出来
The man you killed just got released from prison.

1478
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:22,120
他在一个  满是违禁品的公司仓库里被抓
He got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items.

1479
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:24,840
他可以他妈的脱罪
He could've fuckin' walked.

1480
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,070
只要他说出我老爹的名字
All he had to do was say my dad's name

1481
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:29,020
但他没有  他守口如瓶
but he didn't; he kept his mouth shut.

1482
01:29:29,350 --> 01:29:32,230
他像个男人那样什么都没说
He did his fuckin' time like a man.

1483
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:34,600
他为我们坐了四年牢
He did four years for us.

1484
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:37,100
所以  橙先生...
So Mr. Orange...

1485
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:40,140
你说我的这个好朋友...
you're telling me that this good friend of mine...

1486
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:43,070
替我父亲坐了四年牢的人...
who did four years for my father...

1487
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:45,640
四年里从没妥协
who in four years never made a deal

1488
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:47,950
没向他们说出半个字的人
no matter what they offered him...

1489
01:29:48,410 --> 01:29:51,160
你告诉我现在他自由了...
you're telling me that now that he's free...

1490
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:54,170
并且我们向他作出了很好的承诺...
and we're making good on our commitment to him...

1491
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:58,830
他却决定  不算这个该死的警察...
he's just gonna decide out of the fucking blue...

1492
01:29:59,290 --> 01:30:00,960
把我们全干掉  
to rip us off?

1493
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:05,920
为什么你不告诉我真相  
Why don't you tell me what really happened.

1494
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:07,760
到底怎么回事  
What the hell for?

1495
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:10,780
用不着再废话
It'd just be more bullshit.

1496
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:14,890
这个人出卖了我们
This man set us up.

1497
01:30:16,230 --> 01:30:19,140
爸  我很抱歉  但我不知道发生了什么事
Dad I'm sorry but I don't know what's happening.

1498
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:22,960
-没关系  我知道  -你在说什么  
-It's all right. I do. -What are you talking about?

1499
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:26,730
这个愚蠢的废物是洛杉矶警方的人
That lump of shit's workin' with the L.A.P.D.

1500
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:31,410
我他妈的一点都不明白...
I don't have the slightest fucking idea...

1501
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:33,000
你在说什么
what you're talking about.

1502
01:30:33,110 --> 01:30:36,540
乔  我不知道你以为自己知道什么  但你错了
Joe I don't know what you think you know but you're wrong.

1503
01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:38,450
的确如此
Like hell I am.

1504
01:30:38,690 --> 01:30:41,600
你要相信我  你弄错了
Trust me on this. You've made a mistake.

1505
01:30:41,890 --> 01:30:43,430
他是个好伙计
He's a good kid.

1506
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:46,020
我明白你非常恼火
I understand you're super-fuckin'-pissed.

1507
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:47,900
我们都很激动
We're all real emotional.

1508
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:50,070
但是你弄错了对像
But you're barking up the wrong tree.

1509
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:52,100
我了解他  他没有那样做
I know this man. He wouldn't do that.

1510
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:53,850
你不知道警察的把戏
You don't know jack shit!

1511
01:30:53,970 --> 01:30:55,080
我知道
I do.

1512
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,060
这个杂种向警方告密...
The cocksucker tipped off the cops...

1513
01:30:57,260 --> 01:30:59,290
害死了褐先生和蓝先生
and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.

1514
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:02,300
-蓝先生死了  -是的
-Mr. Blue is dead? -Dead as Dillinger.

1515
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:04,400
你怎么知道这些  
How do you know all this?

1516
01:31:04,650 --> 01:31:07,860
他是我唯一不能完全信任的人
He was the only one I wasn't 100 percent on.

1517
01:31:08,150 --> 01:31:09,670
我该检讨自己
I should have my head examined going ahead

1518
01:31:09,670 --> 01:31:11,190
在没有十足把握时就开始行动
when I wasn't 100 percent.

1519
01:31:11,490 --> 01:31:15,010
-那就是你的证据  -有直觉你就用不着证据
-That's your proof? -With instinct you don't need proof.

1520
01:31:15,330 --> 01:31:17,470
我以前忽视了  但再也不会
I ignored it before but no more.

1521
01:31:19,930 --> 01:31:22,140
你是不是他妈的疯了  
Have you lost your fuckin' mind?

1522
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:25,030
我不会让你犯一个大错误
I'm not gonna let you make a terrible mistake.

1523
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:28,030
拜托  伙计们  没人想这样
Come on guys. Nobody wants this.

1524
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:30,070
我们该他妈的表现得专业点
We're supposed to be fuckin' professionals.

1525
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:32,800
拉里  听着...
Larry look...

1526
01:31:33,050 --> 01:31:34,840

01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:36,360
很多生意
A lot of jobs.

1528
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,390
不需要这样  伙计
There's no need for this man.

1529
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:41,930
我们都把枪放下
Let's just put our guns down...

1530
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:44,810
把事情弄清楚
and let's settle this...

1531
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:46,550
他妈的好好谈谈
with a fucking conversation.

1532
01:31:46,690 --> 01:31:50,010
乔  如果你杀了他  你会是下一个
Joe if you kill that man you die next.

1533
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:52,340
再说一次  你杀他  我就杀你
Repeat: you kill him you die next.

1534
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:55,670
拉里  我们是朋友
Larry we have been friends.

1535
01:31:55,970 --> 01:31:57,950
你尊敬我父亲我也尊敬你
You respect my dad and I respect you...

1536
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:59,970
但是我会向你开枪
but I'll put bullets in you.

1537
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:02,280
现在你把那该死的枪放下
You put that fuckin' gun down now.

1538
01:32:03,170 --> 01:32:05,380
该死的  乔...
Goddamn you Joe...

1539
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:06,930
别让我这么做
don't make me do this.

1540
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,570
拉里  别拿枪指着我老爹
Larry you stop pointin' that gun at my dad!

1541
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,340
对不起  伙计
I'm sorry kid.

1542
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:02,680
看来我们还要...
Looks like we're gonna...

1543
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:05,950
再支持一会
do a little time.

1544
01:34:12,530 --> 01:34:14,390
我是个警察
I'm a cop.

1545
01:34:16,270 --> 01:34:18,130
拉里...
Larry...

1546
01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:21,330
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1547
01:34:22,610 --> 01:34:24,300

(? Ηarry Nilsson: Coconut)

1560
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:39,019
? Brother bought a coconut,
he bought it for a dime

1561
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:42,419
? Ηis sister had another one,
