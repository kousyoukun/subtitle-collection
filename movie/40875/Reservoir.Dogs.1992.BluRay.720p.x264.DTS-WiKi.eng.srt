1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,952
Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin" is about.

2
00:00:09,036 --> 00:00:12,289
It's all about a girl
who digs a guy with a big dick.

3
00:00:12,373 --> 00:00:14,542
The entire song
is a metaphor for big dicks.

4
00:00:14,626 --> 00:00:16,044
No, it ain't.

5
00:00:16,127 --> 00:00:19,297
It's about a girl
who's very vulnerable.

6
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:22,634
She's been fucked over a few times
and she meets a guy who's sensitive.

7
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:25,971
Whoa. Timeout.
Tell that bullshit to the tourists.

8
00:00:26,056 --> 00:00:28,266
Toby? Who the fuck is Toby?

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,938
"Like A Virgin" is not about some
sensitive girl who meets a nice fella.

10
00:00:33,022 --> 00:00:35,650
That's what "True Blue" is about.
No argument about that.

11
00:00:35,692 --> 00:00:39,571
- Which one is "True Blue"?
- It was a big-ass hit for Madonna.

12
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:43,075
I don't even follow that top-of-the-pops
shit, and I've heard of "True Blue."

13
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:45,953
I didn't say I ain't heard of it.
All I asked is, how's it go?

14
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:48,457
Excuse me for not being
the world's biggest Madonna fan.

15
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,960
Personally, I can do without her.

16
00:00:51,044 --> 00:00:53,129
I used to like her early stuff,
"Borderline"...

17
00:00:53,213 --> 00:00:56,133
but once she got off with that
"Papa, Don't Preach" phase, I tuned out.

18
00:00:56,216 --> 00:00:59,052
Hey, you guys are making me
lose my train of thought here.

19
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,263
I was sayin' something.
What was it?

20
00:01:01,347 --> 00:01:04,642
Oh, Toby's that
little Chinese girl.

21
00:01:04,726 --> 00:01:07,354
- What was her last name?
- What's that?

22
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,901
It's an old address book I found in
a coat I haven't worn in a coon's age.

23
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:15,071
- What was that name?
- What the fuck was I talkin' about?

24
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:17,365
You said "True Blue"
was about a guy--

25
00:01:17,408 --> 00:01:19,702
a sensitive girl
who meets a nice guy...

26
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:22,372
but "Like A Virgin"
was a metaphor for big dicks.

27
00:01:22,414 --> 00:01:24,708
Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin" is about.

28
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:27,712
It's all about this cooze
who's a regular fuck machine.

29
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,173
I'm talkin' morning, day,
night, afternoon...

30
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,093
dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick!

31
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,345
- How many "dicks" is that?
- A lot.

32
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,724
Then one day, she meets
this John Holmes motherfucker.

33
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:42,396
It's like, "Whoa, baby." He's like
Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape."

34
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,983
He's diggin' tunnels.
Now she's gettin' serious dick action.

35
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:50,530
She's feelin' somethin' she ain't
felt since forever: pain, pain.

36
00:01:50,614 --> 00:01:52,240
Chew? Toby Chew?

37
00:01:52,283 --> 00:01:54,577
It hurts. It hurts her.

38
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:57,121
It shouldn't hurt her.
Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now.

39
00:01:57,163 --> 00:01:59,832
But when this cat
fucks her, it hurts.

40
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:03,045
It hurts just like it did
the first time.

41
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:05,757
You see, the pain
is reminding a fuck machine...

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,925
what it was once like
to be a virgin.

43
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,845
Hence, "Like A Virgin."

44
00:02:12,014 --> 00:02:13,515
Wong.

45
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,770
-Give me that fuckin' thing.
-What in hell do you think you're doin'?

46
00:02:17,854 --> 00:02:20,940
I'm sick of hearin' it, Joe.
I'll give it back to you when we leave.

47
00:02:20,983 --> 00:02:23,527
What do you mean, when we leave?
Give me it back now!

48
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:27,574
For the past 15 minutes now,
you've been droning on about names.

49
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:30,494
"Toby. Toby?

50
00:02:30,536 --> 00:02:32,830
Toby? Toby Wong.

51
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:35,083
Toby Wong? Toby Wong.

52
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:38,087
Toby Chung fuckin' Charlie Chan."

53
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,631
I've got Madonna's big dick
comin' out of my left ear...

54
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:44,636
and Toby the Jap-- I don't know what--
comin' out of my right.

55
00:02:44,678 --> 00:02:47,222
Give me that book.

56
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:49,224
Are you gonna put it away?

57
00:02:49,308 --> 00:02:52,853
I'm gonna do whatever
the fuck I want with it.

58
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:55,357
Well, then I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to keep it.

59
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:58,361
Hey, Joe,
want me to shoot this guy?

60
00:02:58,402 --> 00:02:59,361
Shit.

61
00:02:59,404 --> 00:03:03,492
You shoot me in a dream,
you better wake up and apologize.

62
00:03:07,371 --> 00:03:10,583
You guys been listenin' to K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s" weekend?

63
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:12,502
Yeah. That's fuckin' great.

64
00:03:12,544 --> 00:03:15,422
- You believe the songs they're playin'?
- Know what I heard the other day?

65
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:18,426
"Heartbeat, It's a Lovebeat" by little
Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco family.

66
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:21,053
I haven't heard that song since
I was in the fifth fuckin' grade.

67
00:03:21,138 --> 00:03:24,767
When I was comin' down here, "The Night
the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on.

68
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,728
I ain't heard that song
since it was big.

69
00:03:27,812 --> 00:03:31,024
But when it was big, I must've heard it
a million-trillion fuckin' times.

70
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:33,068
But this is the first time
I ever realized...

71
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:35,905
that the girl singin' the song
is the one who shot Andy.

72
00:03:35,988 --> 00:03:38,574
You didn't know that Vickie Lawrence
was the one who shot Andy?

73
00:03:38,658 --> 00:03:42,579
- I thought the cheatin' wife shot Andy.
- They say that at the end of the song.

74
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:46,083
I know, motherfucker. I just heard it.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

75
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,547
I must've zoned out
during that part before.

76
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:50,672
All right,
I'll take care of the check.

77
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:54,384
All right,
I'll take care of the check.

78
00:03:54,427 --> 00:03:56,804
You guys can get the tip.

79
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:59,265
Should be about a buck apiece.

80
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:02,561
And you, when I come back
I want my book.

81
00:04:02,603 --> 00:04:05,022
Sorry. It's my book now.

82
00:04:05,106 --> 00:04:09,152
Hey, I changed my mind.
Shoot this piece of shit, will ya?

83
00:04:13,574 --> 00:04:16,243
All right, everybody cough up
some green for the little lady.

84
00:04:22,126 --> 00:04:24,336
Come on, throw in a buck.

85
00:04:24,421 --> 00:04:26,089
I don't tip.

86
00:04:26,173 --> 00:04:28,842
- You don't tip?
- I don't believe in it.

87
00:04:28,926 --> 00:04:31,095
You don't believe in tipping?

88
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:34,391
Do you know what these chicks make?
They make shit.

89
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,143
If she don't make enough money,
she can quit.

90
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:40,940
I don't even know a fuckin' Jew
who'd have the balls to say that.

91
00:04:41,024 --> 00:04:43,777
Let me get this straight.
You don't ever tip, huh?

92
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,571
I don't tip because
society says I have to.

93
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:51,035
If they really put forth the effort,
I'll give 'em somethin' extra.

94
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:53,705
But this tipping automatically,
it's for the birds.

95
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,459
As far as I'm concerned,
they're just doin' their job.

96
00:04:57,543 --> 00:04:59,420
- This girl was nice.
- She was okay.

97
00:04:59,504 --> 00:05:01,798
- She wasn't anything special.
- What's special?

98
00:05:01,882 --> 00:05:04,468
Take you in the back
and suck your dick?

99
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:10,099
I'd go over 12% for that.

100
00:05:10,183 --> 00:05:14,020
I ordered coffee, all right?
She's only filled my cup three times.

101
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:16,106
I want it filled six times.

102
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,402
Six times? Well, what if
she's too fuckin' busy?

103
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,614
The words "too fuckin' busy"
shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.

104
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:25,326
Excuse me, Mr. Pink,
but the last fuckin' thing you need's...

105
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,827
another cup of coffee.

106
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:31,290
These ladies aren't starvin' to death.
They make minimum wage.

107
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,460
I used to work minimum wage,
and when I did...

108
00:05:33,544 --> 00:05:36,422
I wasn't lucky enough to have a job
that society deemed tip-worthy.

109
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:38,591
You don't care they're
countin' on your tips to live?

110
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:43,055
You know what this is?

111
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:45,850
The world's smallest violin,
playin' just for the waitresses.

112
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:49,354
You don't have any idea
what you're talkin' about.

113
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:52,774
These people bust their ass.
This is a hard job.

114
00:05:52,858 --> 00:05:56,195
So's working at McDonald's,
but you don't feel the need to tip them.

115
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:58,823
They're servin' you food,
but society says...

116
00:05:58,907 --> 00:06:02,661
"Don't tip these guys over here,
but tip these guys." That's bullshit.

117
00:06:02,745 --> 00:06:04,914
Waitressing is
the number-one occupation...

118
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:07,667
for female non-college graduates
in this country.

119
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:11,714
It's the one job basically
any woman can get and make a living on.

120
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:13,757
The reason is
because of their tips.

121
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:16,469
Fuck all that.

122
00:06:19,306 --> 00:06:21,934
I'm very sorry the government
taxes their tips.

123
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:24,270
That's fucked up.
That ain't my fault.

124
00:06:24,354 --> 00:06:26,439
It would appear that waitresses
are one of the many groups...

125
00:06:26,523 --> 00:06:28,775
the government fucks in the ass
on a regular basis.

126
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:32,404
Show me a paper that says the government
shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.

127
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,116
I'll vote for it.
But what I won't do is play ball.

128
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,079
This non-college bullshit, I got two
words for that: Learn to fuckin' type.

129
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:42,541
If you're expectin' me to help out with
the rent, you're in for a big surprise.

130
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:44,544
He's convinced me.
Give me my dollar back.

131
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:47,965
Hey. Leave the dollars there.

132
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:52,595
All right, ramblers,
let's get ramblin'.

133
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,390
Wait a minute.
Who didn't throw in?

134
00:06:55,474 --> 00:06:58,185
- Mr. Pink.
- Mr. Pink?

135
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:00,897
- Why not?
- He don't tip.

136
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:02,899
He don't tip?

137
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:04,901
- You don't tip?
- He don't believe in it.

138
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:08,280
Shut up. What do you mean,
you don't believe in it?

139
00:07:08,364 --> 00:07:13,036
Cough up a buck, you cheap bastard.
I paid for your goddamn breakfast.

140
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,999
Since you bought breakfast, I'll put in.
But normally I would never do this.

141
00:07:19,127 --> 00:07:21,379
Never mind what you
normally would do.

142
00:07:21,463 --> 00:07:25,926
Just cough in your goddamn buck
like everybody else. Thank you.

143
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:32,142
That was the Partridge Family's
"Doesn't Somebody Want To Be Wanted?"...

144
00:07:32,226 --> 00:07:34,311
followed by Edison Lighthouse's...

145
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,523
"Love Grows Where
My Rosemary Goes"...

146
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:41,236
as K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s" weekend...

147
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,864
just keeps on truckin'.

148
00:07:43,865 --> 00:07:44,365
just keeps on truckin'.

149
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:29,406
I'm gonna die.

150
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:32,409
I'm gonna die!

151
00:09:32,493 --> 00:09:35,371
Just hold on, buddy boy!

152
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:37,123
I'm gonna die!

153
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:42,504
- I'm sorry!
- Give me your hand.

154
00:09:42,546 --> 00:09:46,842
I can't believe she killed me, man!
Who'd have fuckin' thought that?

155
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:51,474
Hey, just cancel
that shit right now!

156
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:55,436
You're hurt. You're hurt
real fuckin' bad, but you ain't dying!

157
00:10:01,903 --> 00:10:04,864
All this blood's scarin'
the shit out of me, Larry!

158
00:10:04,906 --> 00:10:07,367
I'm gonna die!
I know it!

159
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:10,496
Excuse me, I didn't realize
you had a degree in medicine.

160
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:14,709
Are you a doctor?

161
00:10:14,793 --> 00:10:16,670
Are you a doctor?

162
00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:19,173
Answer me, please!
Are you a doctor?

163
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:23,928
No, I'm not.
I'm not.

164
00:10:24,012 --> 00:10:27,057
So you admit you don't know
what you're talkin' about.

165
00:10:27,141 --> 00:10:31,688
If you're through givin' me your
amateur opinion, lie back and listen.

166
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:35,191
I'm takin' you back to the rendezvous,
Joe's gonna get you a doctor...

167
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,988
the doctor's gonna
fix you up and...

168
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,324
you're gonna be okay.

169
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:44,786
Now say it!
You're gonna be okay!

170
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,288
Say it!

171
00:10:46,372 --> 00:10:49,208
You're gonna be okay!

172
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,378
Say the goddamn words!
You're gonna be okay!

173
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:53,922
Oh, God!

174
00:10:53,964 --> 00:10:56,049
Say the goddamn fuckin' words!

175
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:57,718
Say it!

176
00:10:57,802 --> 00:10:59,971
Okay, Larry.

177
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:02,933
Correct! Correct!

178
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:07,605
I'm okay.

179
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,909
Look where we are.

180
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:20,662
Look where we are.

181
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:24,542
She had a baby, man.
She had a baby!

182
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,543
We're in a warehouse.

183
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:30,924
Who's a tough guy?
Who's a tough guy?

184
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:34,845
Come on, who's a tough guy?

185
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:37,765
Who's a tough guy?
You're a tough guy.

186
00:11:37,808 --> 00:11:39,768
You're a fuckin' tough guy.

187
00:11:45,191 --> 00:11:47,944
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.

188
00:11:47,986 --> 00:11:50,363
We made it. We made it.

189
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:53,743
We fuckin' made it.
We have fuckin' made it.

190
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:58,832
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.

191
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:02,252
Look where we are.

192
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,048
Hold on. Hold on.

193
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:09,844
- Shit!
- Stop bangin' your head.

194
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,348
You're gonna bang
a fuckin' hole in the floor.

195
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:16,185
You don't wanna hurt
the fuckin' floor, do you?

196
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:19,439
I can't do anything for you.

197
00:12:19,524 --> 00:12:21,985
But when Joe gets here...

198
00:12:22,026 --> 00:12:24,028
which should be any time now...

199
00:12:24,112 --> 00:12:27,240
he's gonna help you out,
he's gonna take care of you.

200
00:12:27,324 --> 00:12:29,743
We're gonna sit
and wait for Joe.

201
00:12:31,705 --> 00:12:35,250
- Who are we waitin' for?
- Joe.

202
00:12:39,631 --> 00:12:43,760
Larry, I'm fucking scared, man.

203
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,559
Would you please hold me?

204
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:51,394
Yeah, sure.

205
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:20,012
You go ahead and be scared.

206
00:13:20,095 --> 00:13:22,514
You've been brave enough
for one day.

207
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:29,898
I just want you
to relax now, okay?

208
00:13:29,982 --> 00:13:32,318
You're not gonna fuckin' die.
You're gonna be fine.

209
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:35,863
When Joe gets here,
he'll make you 100% again.

210
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,076
Am I hurt?
I'm hurt bad, Larry.

211
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:44,165
It's not good, no.

212
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:45,667
Hey, Larry...

213
00:13:46,877 --> 00:13:49,797
bless your heart
for what you're tryin' to do.

214
00:13:51,048 --> 00:13:53,759
I was panicking
for a minute back there.

215
00:13:54,803 --> 00:13:57,931
But I got my senses back now.

216
00:13:58,015 --> 00:14:01,101
The situation is,
I'm shot in the belly.

217
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:04,314
Without medical attention,
I'm gonna die.

218
00:14:07,943 --> 00:14:11,405
- I can't take you to a hospital.
- Fuck jail, man!

219
00:14:11,489 --> 00:14:16,077
You don't have to take me in.
Just drive me up to the front, man.

220
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:19,873
Just drop me on the sidewalk.
I'll take care of myself.

221
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:26,631
I won't tell 'em anything, man.
I won't tell 'em anything.

222
00:14:26,674 --> 00:14:29,385
I swear to fucking God, man.

223
00:14:31,012 --> 00:14:34,641
Just look in my eyes, Larry.
Look in my eyes.

224
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:40,440
I won't tell them anything.

225
00:14:40,523 --> 00:14:42,483
You'll be safe, man.

226
00:14:43,944 --> 00:14:47,907
You're not gonna fuckin' die, kid.
All right?

227
00:14:47,991 --> 00:14:51,119
Listen to me.
You're gonna be fine.

228
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:54,540
Along with the kneecap...

229
00:14:54,623 --> 00:14:57,167
the gut is the most painful area
a guy can get shot in.

230
00:14:57,252 --> 00:14:58,420
No shit!

231
00:14:58,503 --> 00:15:01,256
But it takes a long time
to die from it.

232
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,759
I'm talkin' days.

233
00:15:03,843 --> 00:15:08,014
You're gonna wish you were dead, but
it takes days to die from your wound.

234
00:15:08,056 --> 00:15:09,849
Time is on your side.

235
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:12,185
Was that a fucking setup, or what?

236
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:15,773
Shit. Orange got tagged?

237
00:15:16,775 --> 00:15:18,610
Gut shot.

238
00:15:18,694 --> 00:15:20,946
Fuck. Where's Brown?

239
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,364
Dead.

240
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:25,910
How did he die?

241
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:29,205
How the fuck do you think?
The cops shot him.

242
00:15:30,082 --> 00:15:31,375
This is bad.

243
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:35,171
This is so fucking bad.
Is it bad?

244
00:15:35,255 --> 00:15:36,923
As opposed to good?

245
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:40,218
Man, this is fucked up.

246
00:15:40,302 --> 00:15:42,554
This is so fucked up.

247
00:15:42,638 --> 00:15:45,599
Somebody fucked us up
big time, man.

248
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,233
- You really think we were set up?
- Do you even doubt it, man?

249
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:56,780
I don't think we got set up, I know it.
Where did all those cops come from, huh?

250
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,283
One minute they're not there,
and the next minute they're there.

251
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,620
I didn't hear any sirens.
The alarm went off, okay?

252
00:16:02,704 --> 00:16:05,206
When an alarm goes, you got
a four-minute response time.

253
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,918
Unless a patrol car is cruising
that street at that moment...

254
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,546
you got four minutes before
they can realistically respond.

255
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,591
In one minute, there were
17 blue boys out there...

256
00:16:13,675 --> 00:16:17,053
all knowing exactly what the fuck they
were doing, and they were all there!

257
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:21,017
Remember that second wave
that showed up in the cars?

258
00:16:21,101 --> 00:16:23,729
Those were the ones responding to the
alarm, but those first motherfuckers...

259
00:16:23,812 --> 00:16:26,231
they were there
and they were waitin' for us.

260
00:16:26,315 --> 00:16:28,817
Haven't you fuckin'
thought about this?

261
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:31,612
I haven't had a chance to think.

262
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:34,950
First I was just tryin'
to get the fuck outta there.

263
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:38,120
And after we got away,
I've just been dealin' with him.

264
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:40,540
Better start thinkin' about it,
'cause that's all I'm thinkin' about.

265
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,460
I wasn't even gonna come here.
I was just gonna drive off, man...

266
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,130
because whoever set us up
knows about this place.

267
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:49,968
There could've been cops here waitin'!
There could be cops comin' right now!

268
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:56,976
Let's go in the other room.
Hey. In there.

269
00:16:57,018 --> 00:16:59,604
Larry, don't leave me.

270
00:17:04,026 --> 00:17:07,613
I'll be right in the other room, okay?
I'll be right there lookin' at ya.

271
00:17:07,697 --> 00:17:10,283
I'm right here
lookin' at you, okay?

272
00:17:12,912 --> 00:17:14,872
I'm right over there.

273
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,002
Larry...

274
00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:21,338
I'm gonna fucking die.

275
00:17:21,422 --> 00:17:23,174
Larry.

276
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:27,637
What the fuck
am I doin' here, man?

277
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:29,806
I felt funny about
this job right off.

278
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,602
As soon as I felt it I should have said,
"No, thank you," but I never listen.

279
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,980
Every time I ever got fucked
buying weed, the same thing.

280
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:38,733
I didn't trust the guy,
but I wanted to believe him.

281
00:17:38,817 --> 00:17:41,695
If he's not lying and it really
is Thai stick, then it's great.

282
00:17:41,737 --> 00:17:45,157
But it never is, and I always said that
if I felt that about a job, I'd walk.

283
00:17:45,242 --> 00:17:48,370
And I didn't. I didn't
because of the fuckin' money!

284
00:17:48,454 --> 00:17:51,248
What's done is done.
I need you cool.

285
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,251
Are you cool?

286
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,005
I'm cool.

287
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:01,051
Splash some water on your face.

288
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:06,683
Take a breather.

289
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:24,246
Relax. Have a cigarette.

290
00:18:24,288 --> 00:18:26,290
I quit.

291
00:18:26,332 --> 00:18:29,085
- All right.
- Why, you got one?

292
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:05,502
Okay, let's go through
what happened.

293
00:19:05,587 --> 00:19:08,131
We're in the place,
everything's going fine.

294
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:10,342
Then the alarm gets tripped.

295
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:14,805
I turn around
and all these cops are outside.

296
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:20,270
You're right. It was like, bam,
I blinked my eyes and they're there.

297
00:19:20,354 --> 00:19:24,734
Everybody starts going ape-shit.
Then Mr. Blonde starts to shoot all--

298
00:19:24,818 --> 00:19:27,779
- That's not correct.
- What's wrong with it?

299
00:19:27,863 --> 00:19:31,575
Okay. The cops did not show up
after the alarm went off.

300
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:35,246
The cops didn't show up until after
Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.

301
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,458
- Soon as I heard the alarm, I saw cops.
- It wasn't that soon.

302
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:42,379
They didn't let their presence be known
until after Mr. Blonde became a madman.

303
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,383
I'm not sayin' they weren't there.
I'm sayin' they were there.

304
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:49,346
But they didn't make a move until after
Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.

305
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,391
I mean, that's how
I know we were set up.

306
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:55,812
- Mr. White, you can see that--
- Enough of this "Mr. White" shit.

307
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:59,567
Wait! Don't tell me you're fuckin' name!
I don't wanna know it!

308
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,236
Jesus Christ,
I ain't gonna tell you mine.

309
00:20:07,576 --> 00:20:09,870
You're right.
This is bad.

310
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:18,714
- How did you get out?
- I shot my way out.

311
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:21,259
Everybody started shootin',
so I blasted my way out of there.

312
00:20:25,431 --> 00:20:29,310
Move it! Get outta the way!
Get the fuck outta the way!

313
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,939
Get the fuck outta the way!

314
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,277
Move it!
Get outta the way!

315
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,036
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck is your problem, man?

316
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:48,374
- You fuckin' asshole!
- Fuck you!

317
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,417
Move!

318
00:20:56,843 --> 00:20:58,052
Jesus!

319
00:20:58,136 --> 00:21:00,555
Get outta the car!
Get the fuck outta the car!

320
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:02,808
Move it!
Move outta the way!

321
00:21:31,926 --> 00:21:34,428
I tagged a couple of cops.

322
00:21:34,512 --> 00:21:36,597
Did you kill anybody?

323
00:21:36,682 --> 00:21:39,810
- A few cops.
- No real people?

324
00:21:39,894 --> 00:21:41,854
Just cops.

325
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:55,245
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

326
00:21:56,705 --> 00:21:59,708
That was the most insane
fuckin' thing I have ever seen.

327
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:02,462
Why the fuck would Joe
hire a guy like that?

328
00:22:02,546 --> 00:22:04,131
I don't want to kill anybody.

329
00:22:04,214 --> 00:22:06,842
If I gotta get out that door
and you're standin' in my way...

330
00:22:06,884 --> 00:22:09,345
one way or the other
you're gettin' outta my way.

331
00:22:09,387 --> 00:22:11,764
That's the way I look at it.

332
00:22:11,848 --> 00:22:14,434
The choice between
doin' ten years...

333
00:22:14,518 --> 00:22:17,312
and takin' out
some stupid motherfucker...

334
00:22:18,314 --> 00:22:20,441
ain't no choice at all.

335
00:22:20,525 --> 00:22:23,194
But I ain't no madman, either.

336
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:26,907
What the fuck was Joe thinkin'?
You can't work with a guy like that.

337
00:22:29,452 --> 00:22:32,830
We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't
tag us when he shot the place up.

338
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:36,878
I came this close
to takin' his ass out myself.

339
00:22:36,961 --> 00:22:40,006
I mean, everybody panics.
Everybody.

340
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,718
Things get tense.
It's human nature.

341
00:22:42,801 --> 00:22:46,555
You panic. I don't care what
your name is, you can't help it.

342
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:50,477
Fuck, man, you panic on the inside,
in your head, you know?

343
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:54,732
You give yourself a couple of seconds,
get ahold of it and deal with it.

344
00:22:54,816 --> 00:22:57,902
What you don't do is start shootin' up
the place and start killin' people.

345
00:22:57,986 --> 00:23:02,157
What you're supposed to do
is act like a fuckin' professional.

346
00:23:02,241 --> 00:23:06,788
A psychopath ain't a professional.
You can't work with a psychopath.

347
00:23:06,872 --> 00:23:09,458
You don't know what those
sick assholes are gonna do next.

348
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:15,757
I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you
think that black girl was? Twenty?

349
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,135
- Maybe 21?
- If that.

350
00:23:20,137 --> 00:23:22,765
Did you see what happened
to anybody else?

351
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:27,521
Me and Orange jumped in the car,
Brown floored it.

352
00:23:27,604 --> 00:23:29,773
After that,
I don't know what went down.

353
00:23:29,857 --> 00:23:31,817
It was every man for himself.

354
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:34,820
As far as Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue are
concerned, I ain't got the foggiest...

355
00:23:34,863 --> 00:23:37,115
'cause once I got out,
I never looked back.

356
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:39,201
What do you think?

357
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:42,538
What do I think? The cops either
caught 'em or killed 'em.

358
00:23:44,332 --> 00:23:47,001
No chance they punched through?
You found a hole.

359
00:23:47,086 --> 00:23:49,422
Yeah, and that was
a fuckin' miracle.

360
00:23:49,505 --> 00:23:53,259
But even if they did get away,
then where the fuck are they?

361
00:23:53,343 --> 00:23:56,680
You don't think it's possible one of 'em
got ahold of the diamonds and--

362
00:23:56,764 --> 00:24:00,142
- No, no way.
- How can you be so sure?

363
00:24:01,603 --> 00:24:04,105
I got the diamonds.

364
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,034
That's my boy.

365
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:16,829
- Where?
- I stashed 'em.

366
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:21,126
If you wanna come with me,
let's go get 'em right now, this second.

367
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:24,796
'Cause I think stayin' here, man, we
should have our fuckin' heads examined.

368
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,965
That was the plan.
We meet here.

369
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,968
Then where the fuck is everybody?

370
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:32,138
I say the plan becomes null and void
once we found out we got a rat here.

371
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:35,308
We ain't got the slightest idea
what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue.

372
00:24:35,393 --> 00:24:37,729
They could both be dead
or maybe they're arrested.

373
00:24:37,812 --> 00:24:40,732
The cops could have 'em right now
at the station, sweatin' 'em down.

374
00:24:40,816 --> 00:24:44,403
They don't know our names, but they
could be singin' about this place.

375
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:56,125
I swear to God,
I think I'm fuckin' jinxed.

376
00:24:56,209 --> 00:24:58,127
What?

377
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,966
Two jobs back,
it was a four-man job.

378
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,469
We discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop.

379
00:25:07,431 --> 00:25:09,057
No shit?

380
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:12,728
Thank God we discovered in time.

381
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:15,898
We had to forget the whole thing,
just walk the fuck away from it.

382
00:25:16,942 --> 00:25:19,152
So who's the rat this time?

383
00:25:19,236 --> 00:25:21,196
Mr. Blue?

384
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,032
Mr. Brown?

385
00:25:23,116 --> 00:25:27,245
Joe? Joe set this whole thing up.
Maybe he set it up to set it up.

386
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:30,833
I don't buy it.
Me and Joe go back a long time.

387
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:34,212
I can tell you definitely, Joe didn't
know a thing about this bullshit.

388
00:25:34,296 --> 00:25:38,926
I know Joe, and me sayin' he definitely
had nothin' to do with it is ridiculous.

389
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:42,096
I can say I definitely didn't do it,
'cause I know what I did or didn't do.

390
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,642
But I cannot definitely say that about
anybody, 'cause I don't definitely know.

391
00:25:45,684 --> 00:25:47,811
For all I know, you're the rat.

392
00:25:47,895 --> 00:25:50,272
For all I know,
you're the fuckin' rat!

393
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,692
All right, now you're usin'
your fuckin' head.

394
00:25:52,776 --> 00:25:55,237
For all we know, he's the rat.

395
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:58,574
That kid in there is dying
from a fuckin' bullet I saw him take...

396
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:00,785
so don't you be calling him a rat!

397
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:03,204
Look, I'm right, okay?

398
00:26:03,288 --> 00:26:05,749
Somebody's a fuckin' rat.

399
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:13,133
Where's the commode in this dungeon?
I gotta take a squirt.

400
00:26:16,053 --> 00:26:18,889
Go down the hall, make a left,
go up the stairs...

401
00:26:18,974 --> 00:26:20,892
and make a right.

402
00:26:28,526 --> 00:26:32,322
- By the way, how's Alabama?
- Alabama?

403
00:26:32,364 --> 00:26:35,993
I haven't seen Bama
in over a year and a half.

404
00:26:36,077 --> 00:26:38,538
But I thought you two
were a team.

405
00:26:39,581 --> 00:26:41,541
We were for a little while.

406
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:45,255
Did about four jobs together,
then decided to call it quits.

407
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:46,881
Why?

408
00:26:50,052 --> 00:26:53,806
You push that woman-man thing too long
and it gets to you after a while.

409
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,017
What's she doin' now?

410
00:26:56,101 --> 00:26:59,605
She hooked up with Frank McGar.
They've done a couple jobs together.

411
00:26:59,688 --> 00:27:01,857
Hell of a woman.
Good little thief.

412
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:09,200
- So explain the telegram.
- Five-man job.

413
00:27:09,283 --> 00:27:11,535
Bustin' in and bustin' out
of a diamond wholesaler's.

414
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:14,580
Can you move the ice afterwards?
I don't know nobody that can move ice.

415
00:27:14,664 --> 00:27:16,874
No problem.
We got guys waitin' for it.

416
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:20,254
What happened to Marcellus Spivey?
Didn't he always move your ice?

417
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,799
He's doin' 20 years in Susanville.

418
00:27:22,882 --> 00:27:26,135
Twenty years? Holy God.
What for?

419
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,638
Bad luck.

420
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:29,556
I guess you can say that again.

421
00:27:30,475 --> 00:27:32,393
What's the exposure like?

422
00:27:32,477 --> 00:27:35,397
Two minutes, tops.
But it's a tough two minutes.

423
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:38,901
Daylight, during business hours,
dealing with a crowd.

424
00:27:38,985 --> 00:27:41,404
But you'll have the guys
to deal with the crowd.

425
00:27:41,488 --> 00:27:44,366
- How many employees?
- I'd say around 20.

426
00:27:44,449 --> 00:27:46,201
Security pretty lax.

427
00:27:46,285 --> 00:27:48,662
They most usually
just deal in boxes.

428
00:27:48,746 --> 00:27:51,749
You know, uncut stones
from the diamond syndicate.

429
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:56,505
But on this day, they're getting a
shipment of polished stones from lsrael.

430
00:27:56,589 --> 00:27:58,841
They're like a way station,
you know?

431
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:02,262
-They get picked up and sent to Vermont.
-No, they're not.

432
00:28:05,766 --> 00:28:07,726
What's the cut, poppa?

433
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:11,439
Juicy, junior.
Real juicy.

434
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:16,696
Look, man, you do what you want.

435
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:19,573
I'm outta here, man. I'm gonna
check into a motel for a few days.

436
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:22,661
You know, I'll lay low
and I'll call Joe--

437
00:28:22,745 --> 00:28:25,331
Shit. Did he fuckin' die on us?

438
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:29,628
Huh? ls he dead or what?

439
00:28:31,088 --> 00:28:34,049
- He ain't dead.
- What is it?

440
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:36,802
I think he's just passed out.

441
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:40,974
He scared the fuckin' shit outta me.
I thought he was dead for sure.

442
00:28:41,016 --> 00:28:43,852
Without medical attention,
he will die for sure.

443
00:28:44,938 --> 00:28:47,899
What are we gonna do, man?
We can't take him to the hospital.

444
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:53,448
Without medical attention,
he might not live through the night.

445
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:56,284
The bullet in his belly
is my fault.

446
00:28:56,368 --> 00:29:00,164
While that might not mean jack shit
to you, it means a hell of a lot to me.

447
00:29:00,247 --> 00:29:04,043
First things first, okay?
Stayin' here's goofy. We gotta book up.

448
00:29:04,127 --> 00:29:06,755
So what do you suggest we do?
Go to a hotel?

449
00:29:06,838 --> 00:29:11,009
We got a guy who's shot in the belly,
who can't walk, bleeds like a stuck pig.

450
00:29:11,052 --> 00:29:13,429
And when he's awake,
he screams in pain.

451
00:29:14,514 --> 00:29:16,516
You got an idea, spit it out.

452
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,393
Joe could help.

453
00:29:18,477 --> 00:29:23,232
If we could get in touch with Joe,
Joe could get him to a doctor.

454
00:29:23,316 --> 00:29:26,319
Joe could get a doctor
to come to see him.

455
00:29:26,403 --> 00:29:30,491
Assuming we can trust Joe,
how we gonna get in touch with him?

456
00:29:30,575 --> 00:29:34,538
He's supposed to be here, but he ain't,
which makes me nervous about bein' here.

457
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:38,375
Even if he is on the up and up, I don't
think he's gonna be too happy with us.

458
00:29:38,417 --> 00:29:41,045
He planned a robbery and
he's got a bloodbath on his hands now.

459
00:29:41,129 --> 00:29:44,466
He's got dead cops, dead robbers,
dead civilians.

460
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,261
I tend to doubt he's gonna have
a lot of sympathy for our plight.

461
00:29:47,345 --> 00:29:52,058
If I was him, I'd put as much distance
between me and this mess as possible.

462
00:29:55,771 --> 00:29:58,565
Before you got here,
Mr. Orange...

463
00:29:58,608 --> 00:30:02,404
was askin' me to take him
to a doctor, to a hospital.

464
00:30:04,281 --> 00:30:07,493
I don't like the idea of
turnin' him over to the cops...

465
00:30:07,577 --> 00:30:10,288
but if we don't,
he's gonna die.

466
00:30:10,372 --> 00:30:13,208
He begged me to do it.

467
00:30:13,292 --> 00:30:17,213
Well, all right.
Then I guess we take him to a hospital.

468
00:30:17,297 --> 00:30:19,466
If that's what he said,
let's do it.

469
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:22,218
Since he don't know nothin' about us,
I say it's his decision.

470
00:30:22,303 --> 00:30:23,929
He knows a little about me.

471
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:30,353
What? Wait, wait.
You didn't tell him your name, did you?

472
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:33,523
I told him my first name
and where I was from.

473
00:30:33,608 --> 00:30:35,026
Why?

474
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:39,197
I told him where I was from
a few days ago.

475
00:30:39,281 --> 00:30:41,992
It was just
a natural conversation.

476
00:30:42,076 --> 00:30:45,079
What was tellin' him your name
when you weren't supposed to?

477
00:30:45,163 --> 00:30:46,706
He asked.

478
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:51,795
We had just gotten away from the cops.
He just got shot.

479
00:30:51,838 --> 00:30:55,300
It was my fault he got shot.

480
00:30:55,383 --> 00:30:57,802
He's a fuckin' bloody mess.

481
00:30:57,886 --> 00:31:00,305
He's screamin'.

482
00:31:00,348 --> 00:31:03,560
I swear to God, I thought he was
gonna die right then and there.

483
00:31:03,643 --> 00:31:07,564
I'm tryin' to comfort him,
telling him not to worry...

484
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:11,235
everything's going to be okay,
I'm gonna take care of him.

485
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:13,655
And he asked me
what my name was.

486
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:19,995
I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms.
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

487
00:31:21,498 --> 00:31:26,295
Tell him I'm sorry? I can't
give out that fuckin' information?

488
00:31:26,378 --> 00:31:29,381
It's against the rules?

489
00:31:29,465 --> 00:31:32,385
I don't trust you enough?

490
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:35,681
Maybe I should've,
but I couldn't.

491
00:31:35,764 --> 00:31:38,225
Fuck you! Fuck Joe!

492
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:41,521
- I'm sure it was a beautiful scene.
- Don't fuckin' patronize me!

493
00:31:41,605 --> 00:31:44,066
I have one question. Do they have
a sheet on you where you're from?

494
00:31:44,108 --> 00:31:46,402
- Yeah!
- That's that, then.

495
00:31:46,485 --> 00:31:49,363
I mean, I was worried about
mug shot possibility as it was.

496
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:53,744
He knows A, your name, B, your face,
C, your hometown and D, your specialty.

497
00:31:53,827 --> 00:31:57,080
They're not gonna have to show him a lot
of pictures for him to pick you out!

498
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,752
You didn't tell him anything else
so they could narrow down the selection?

499
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:04,423
If I have to tell you again to back off,
we're gonna go 'round and 'round.

500
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:07,427
We ain't takin' him to a hospital.

501
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,178
If we don't, he's gonna die.

502
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:12,348
And I'm very sad about that, but
some fellas are lucky and some ain't.

503
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:15,061
What the fuck are you
touchin' me for, man?

504
00:32:20,442 --> 00:32:22,527
I'll show you
who you're fuckin' with!

505
00:32:22,611 --> 00:32:24,738
You wanna shoot me,
you piece of shit?

506
00:32:24,822 --> 00:32:27,908
I didn't create this situation,
I'm dealin' with it!

507
00:32:27,993 --> 00:32:31,747
You're actin' like a first-year thief!
I'm actin' like a professional!

508
00:32:31,831 --> 00:32:34,625
If they get him, they could get you,
they could get closer to me...

509
00:32:34,709 --> 00:32:36,669
and that can't happen!

510
00:32:36,753 --> 00:32:39,464
You're lookin' at me like it's my fault?
I didn't tell him my name!

511
00:32:39,548 --> 00:32:42,050
I didn't tell him
where I was from!

512
00:32:42,134 --> 00:32:44,762
Shit! Fifteen minutes ago
you almost told me your name!

513
00:32:44,804 --> 00:32:47,014
You're gonna get stuck
in a situation you created!

514
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:50,519
So if you wanna throw bad looks around,
throw 'em at a mirror!

515
00:32:50,603 --> 00:32:53,523
You kids shouldn't play so rough.

516
00:32:53,606 --> 00:32:56,442
Somebody's gonna start cryin'.

517
00:32:56,526 --> 00:32:58,152
Mr. Blonde.

518
00:33:00,281 --> 00:33:02,533
Shit. You're fuckin' kickin' me.

519
00:33:07,331 --> 00:33:11,168
What happened to you?
Figured you were dead.

520
00:33:14,756 --> 00:33:17,467
Hey, you okay?

521
00:33:18,761 --> 00:33:21,097
Did you see what happened to Blue?

522
00:33:21,181 --> 00:33:24,810
We didn't know what happened to you.
That's what we were wonderin' about.

523
00:33:26,854 --> 00:33:29,648
Look, Brown is dead,
Orange got it in the belly.

524
00:33:29,732 --> 00:33:31,984
Enough! Enough!

525
00:33:32,027 --> 00:33:35,155
You better start talkin', asshole.

526
00:33:35,197 --> 00:33:38,075
'Cause we got shit
we need to talk about.

527
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,869
We're already freaked out.

528
00:33:39,953 --> 00:33:43,373
We need you actin' freaky
like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.

529
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,168
Okay, let's talk.

530
00:33:46,252 --> 00:33:48,671
We think we got
a rat in the house.

531
00:33:48,755 --> 00:33:50,757
I guarantee we got
a rat in the house.

532
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:52,634
What makes you say that?

533
00:33:52,718 --> 00:33:54,678
Is that supposed to be funny?

534
00:33:54,762 --> 00:33:57,515
Look, we think
this place ain't safe.

535
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:00,352
This place ain't secure anymore.
We're leavin' and you should go with us.

536
00:34:00,435 --> 00:34:02,687
Nobody's goin' anywhere.

537
00:34:03,564 --> 00:34:06,275
Piss on this fuckin' turd.

538
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:09,529
- We're outta here.
- Don't take another step, Mr. White.

539
00:34:09,571 --> 00:34:12,365
Fuck you, maniac!

540
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:17,163
It's your fuckin' fault
we're in this trouble!

541
00:34:17,247 --> 00:34:19,791
What's this guy's problem?

542
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:22,795
What's my problem?
Yeah, I got a fuckin' problem!

543
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:25,672
I got a big fuckin' problem...

544
00:34:25,757 --> 00:34:28,760
with any trigger-happy madman
who almost gets me shot!

545
00:34:30,596 --> 00:34:34,308
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
- That fucking shooting spree!

546
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,770
In the store! Remember?

547
00:34:37,855 --> 00:34:42,652
Oh, fuck 'em. They set off the alarm.
They deserve what they got.

548
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:44,695
You almost killed me!

549
00:34:45,781 --> 00:34:47,074
Asshole!

550
00:34:49,452 --> 00:34:53,498
If I knew what kind of guy you were, I
never would've agreed to work with you.

551
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:58,586
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...

552
00:34:58,671 --> 00:35:00,631
or are you gonna bite?

553
00:35:00,673 --> 00:35:02,800
What was that?

554
00:35:05,345 --> 00:35:09,266
I'm sorry, I didn't catch it.
Would you repeat it?

555
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:13,104
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...

556
00:35:14,273 --> 00:35:16,191
or are you gonna bite?

557
00:35:16,275 --> 00:35:19,236
You two assholes, calm the fuck down!
Hey, come on!

558
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,907
What, are we on a playground here?
Am I the only professional?

559
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:25,327
You're actin' like
a bunch of fuckin' niggers!

560
00:35:25,411 --> 00:35:28,706
Ever work with niggers? Always sayin'
they're gonna kill each other.

561
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,708
You said yourself
you thought about taking him out.

562
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:33,336
- You fuckin' said that?
- Yeah, I did, okay?

563
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,091
But that was then. Right now, this guy
is the only one I completely trust.

564
00:35:37,175 --> 00:35:39,969
-He's too homicidal to be with the cops.
-You takin' his side?

565
00:35:40,053 --> 00:35:43,056
Fuck sides, man!
What we need here is solidarity!

566
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,061
Somebody's stickin' a red-hot poker
up our ass, and I want to know who.

567
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,983
Fuck. Look, I know
I'm no piece of shit.

568
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:55,946
I'm pretty sure you're okay, and I'm
fuckin' positive you're on the level.

569
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,784
So let's try and figure out
who the bad guy is, all right?

570
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:03,997
Wow.

571
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:06,166
That was really exciting.

572
00:36:08,044 --> 00:36:11,005
I bet you're a big
Lee Marvin fan, aren't ya?

573
00:36:13,342 --> 00:36:16,387
Yeah, me too.
I love that guy.

574
00:36:18,014 --> 00:36:22,769
My heart's beatin' so fast,
I'm about to have a heart attack here.

575
00:36:22,854 --> 00:36:27,693
I got somethin' outside that
I'd like to show you guys, so follow me.

576
00:36:27,734 --> 00:36:29,611
Follow you? Where?

577
00:36:30,613 --> 00:36:32,239
To my car.

578
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,869
Did you forget your French fries
to go with the soda?

579
00:36:35,911 --> 00:36:39,707
No, I had them already. I got somethin'
I think you might wanna see, though.

580
00:36:39,748 --> 00:36:41,750
- What?
- It's a big surprise.

581
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:44,795
I'm sure you'll like it.
Come on.

582
00:36:54,725 --> 00:36:57,061
We still gotta get
outta here, you know.

583
00:36:57,102 --> 00:36:59,563
No. We're gonna stick around
and we're gonna wait.

584
00:36:59,605 --> 00:37:02,983
- What for? The cops?
- No. Nice Guy Eddie.

585
00:37:03,068 --> 00:37:07,573
Nice Guy Eddie? What makes you think he
isn't on a plane halfway to Costa Rica?

586
00:37:07,656 --> 00:37:10,993
Because I spoke to him on the phone
and he said he's on the way down here.

587
00:37:11,077 --> 00:37:14,289
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why
didn't you say that in the first place?

588
00:37:14,373 --> 00:37:17,167
- 'Cause you never asked me.
- Hardy-fuckin'-har.

589
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:20,421
- What'd he say?
- He said stay put.

590
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:23,007
So in the meantime...

591
00:37:23,091 --> 00:37:25,760
I'll show you guys somethin'.

592
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,935
Jesus Christ.

593
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:35,022
Maybe our boy in blue here
can answer some of these questions...

594
00:37:35,106 --> 00:37:38,443
about this rat business
you've been talkin' about.

595
00:37:38,526 --> 00:37:41,487
You're a piece of work,
my friend.

596
00:37:41,572 --> 00:37:43,616
Let's get him
the fuck outta here.

597
00:37:45,993 --> 00:37:48,245
Hey, Sid, will you relax?

598
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,582
I've known you a long time.
I'm not worried.

599
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:53,168
I know you'll pay me back.

600
00:37:53,252 --> 00:37:57,006
Don't tell me what I already know.
Don't embarrass me.

601
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:01,178
So you had a few bad months.
You do what everybody else does.

602
00:38:01,261 --> 00:38:06,141
I don't care if it's J.P. Morgan
or lrving the tailor. You ride it out.

603
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:08,812
- Vic Vega's outside.
- Hold on.

604
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:10,939
- Who?
- Vic Vega.

605
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:13,776
Tell him to come in.
I gotta go.

606
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,321
- Come on in.
- A friend of mine's outside.

607
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:18,991
I'll be talkin' to you.
Don't worry.

608
00:38:23,621 --> 00:38:26,040
Hey, welcome home, Vic.

609
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:29,419
How does freedom feel, huh?

610
00:38:29,503 --> 00:38:32,673
- It's a change.
- Ain't that the sad truth.

611
00:38:32,757 --> 00:38:35,677
Sit down, take your coat off,
make yourself at home.

612
00:38:35,761 --> 00:38:37,679
- Have a little drink?
- Yeah.

613
00:38:37,763 --> 00:38:40,766
How about a little Remy Martin?

614
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,810
Sure.

615
00:38:42,894 --> 00:38:44,938
Who's your parole officer?

616
00:38:46,231 --> 00:38:48,316
Seymour Scagnetti.

617
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,944
How is he?

618
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,947
He's a fuckin' asshole.

619
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,991
Won't even let me
leave the halfway house.

620
00:38:55,075 --> 00:38:57,661
It never ceases to amaze me.

621
00:38:57,745 --> 00:39:01,916
A fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there,
slits a woman's throat for 25 cents...

622
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,836
he gets Doris Day
for a parole officer.

623
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,549
A good fella like you
winds up with a ball-bustin' prick.

624
00:39:10,593 --> 00:39:14,055
I want you to know I appreciate all
the packages you sent me on the inside.

625
00:39:14,097 --> 00:39:16,057
What the hell
was I supposed to do?

626
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,102
Forget about you?

627
00:39:18,144 --> 00:39:21,064
I just want you to know
that it meant a lot to me.

628
00:39:21,106 --> 00:39:24,735
It was the least I could do. I wish
to hell I could've done a lot more.

629
00:39:24,818 --> 00:39:27,779
Thanks a lot, Joe.

630
00:39:27,864 --> 00:39:29,282
Ah, Vic.

631
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,496
Toothpick Vic.

632
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,170
So tell me your story, kid.
What are your plans?

633
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:43,715
You son of a bitch. I see you
sittin' there, but I don't believe it.

634
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:46,218
- How you doin', Toothpick?
- Hey, Eddie.

635
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:54,227
Listen, I'm sorry.
I should've picked you up myself.

636
00:39:54,312 --> 00:39:56,940
I was-- My fuckin'--
This week's been crazy.

637
00:39:57,023 --> 00:39:59,275
I've had my head up my ass
the whole time.

638
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,445
Funny you say that, 'cause that's what
me and your daddy were talkin' about.

639
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,448
That I should've picked you up?

640
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:07,243
No, that you had
your head up your ass.

641
00:40:09,496 --> 00:40:11,581
I walk in the door, he's like,
"Vic, Vic...

642
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:15,337
I'm so glad somebody's finally here
who knows what's goin' on.

643
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,006
My son Eddie's a fuck-up.

644
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,093
He's ruining the business.

645
00:40:21,177 --> 00:40:25,056
I mean, I love the guy, but he's
flushin' everything down the toilet."

646
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,310
That's what you said, right, Joe?
Tell him yourself.

647
00:40:28,352 --> 00:40:31,188
Eddie, I hate for you
to hear it like this...

648
00:40:31,272 --> 00:40:35,026
but Vic came in
and asked me how business was.

649
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:38,030
You don't lie to a guy who's
just done four years in the slammer.

650
00:40:38,113 --> 00:40:39,364
That's very true.

651
00:40:44,705 --> 00:40:47,166
All right, enough of this shit!
Break it up!

652
00:40:47,207 --> 00:40:49,501
Come on, this ain't a playground!

653
00:40:53,465 --> 00:40:58,554
You guys wanna roll around on the floor,
you do it in Eddie's office, not mine.

654
00:40:58,638 --> 00:41:01,474
- Daddy, did you see that?
- What?

655
00:41:01,558 --> 00:41:03,643
The guy got me on the ground,
he tried to fuck me.

656
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:06,355
- You wish.
- You sick bastard, Vic.

657
00:41:06,439 --> 00:41:08,858
You tried to fuck me
in my father's office.

658
00:41:08,941 --> 00:41:12,194
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do
in the privacy of your own home...

659
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:14,531
go to it,
but don't try to fuck me.

660
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:16,742
I don't think of you that way.

661
00:41:16,826 --> 00:41:20,955
I like you a lot, buddy,
but I don't think of you that way.

662
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:27,504
Listen, if I was a butt cowboy,
I wouldn't even throw you to the posse.

663
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:31,009
No, you wouldn't.
You'd keep me for yourself.

664
00:41:31,093 --> 00:41:35,431
Four years fuckin' punks up the ass,
you'd appreciate a piece of prime rib.

665
00:41:35,515 --> 00:41:38,893
I might break you in, Nice Guy,
but I'd make you my dog's bitch.

666
00:41:38,977 --> 00:41:40,562
Ain't that a sad sight, Daddy?

667
00:41:40,646 --> 00:41:43,899
A man walks into prison a white man,
walks out talkin' like a fuckin' nigger.

668
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:46,944
You know what?
I think it's all that black semen...

669
00:41:46,986 --> 00:41:49,530
pumped up your asshole, now it's
backed into your fuckin' brain...

670
00:41:49,615 --> 00:41:52,451
and it's comin' out your mouth!

671
00:41:52,535 --> 00:41:56,414
Eddie, you keep talkin' like a bitch,
I'm gonna slap you like a bitch.

672
00:41:56,456 --> 00:41:59,334
Enough of that shit!
I'm sick of it!

673
00:41:59,418 --> 00:42:01,587
Now both of you, sit down.

674
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,929
Now, Eddie...

675
00:42:08,971 --> 00:42:11,974
when you came in here,
we were talkin' some serious business.

676
00:42:13,142 --> 00:42:15,102
Vic here's got a parole problem.

677
00:42:15,186 --> 00:42:18,106
- Who's your P.O.?
- Seymour Scagnetti.

678
00:42:18,148 --> 00:42:20,776
Scagnetti. Fuck.

679
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:24,906
- I hear he's a motherfucker.
- Oh, he's a fucker.

680
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:28,202
Won't even let me leave the halfway
house unless I get some shitty job.

681
00:42:28,285 --> 00:42:30,621
You're comin' back
to work for us, right?

682
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:36,086
Well, I wanna.

683
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:39,006
But first I gotta prove to,
uh, ass-head...

684
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,510
that I can get a regular,
you know, job-type job...

685
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:45,722
before I can move out on my own.

686
00:42:45,806 --> 00:42:49,143
I can't come back to work for you guys
if I gotta worry about, uh...

687
00:42:49,185 --> 00:42:51,604
makin' some silly-ass
10:00 curfew...

688
00:42:51,688 --> 00:42:53,606
every fuckin' night.

689
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:57,110
We can work this out,
can't we, Eddie?

690
00:42:57,194 --> 00:42:59,112
This ain't all that bad.

691
00:42:59,197 --> 00:43:02,242
We can get you
a lot of legitimate jobs.

692
00:43:02,325 --> 00:43:05,161
I'll get you down in Long Beach
as a dockworker.

693
00:43:05,204 --> 00:43:08,541
I don't wanna lift
no fuckin' crates, Eddie.

694
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:12,129
You ain't gonna lift shit.
You don't even work there.

695
00:43:12,212 --> 00:43:15,215
But as far as the records
are concerned, you do.

696
00:43:15,299 --> 00:43:19,178
I call Matthews and tell him he's got
a new guy, boom, you're on the rotation.

697
00:43:19,262 --> 00:43:23,141
You get a time card. It's clocked
in and out for you every day.

698
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:27,855
At the end of the week you get a nice
paycheck. Dockworkers do very well.

699
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:30,567
You can move into a halfway decent place
without Scagnetti goin'...

700
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:32,903
"Where the fuck's
the money comin' from?"

701
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:36,491
And, if he decides
to make a surprise visit...

702
00:43:36,574 --> 00:43:40,870
that's the day we sent you to Tustin
to pick up a load of shit.

703
00:43:40,954 --> 00:43:44,124
If he comes back again, hey,
"Sorry, Seymour.

704
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:45,834
You just missed him.

705
00:43:45,919 --> 00:43:49,381
We had to send him to the Taft airstrip
five fuckin' hours away.

706
00:43:49,464 --> 00:43:52,217
We had a load of shit he had to
pick up there and bring back here."

707
00:43:52,301 --> 00:43:55,888
Part of your job is goin' different
places. That's the beauty of it.

708
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:58,558
We got places all over the place.

709
00:43:58,642 --> 00:44:00,894
See, Vic?
Did I tell you not to worry?

710
00:44:00,978 --> 00:44:04,899
- Vic was worried.
- I'll take you to Long Beach tomorrow.

711
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:08,904
We'll get you fixed up with Matthews,
I'll tell him what's what.

712
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:13,284
You know, I really appreciate
what you guys are doin'...

713
00:44:13,368 --> 00:44:16,079
but I'd like to know
when I can come back...

714
00:44:16,163 --> 00:44:18,415
you know, do some real work.

715
00:44:18,499 --> 00:44:20,835
Well, it's hard to say.

716
00:44:20,918 --> 00:44:23,754
It's kind of a strange time now.

717
00:44:23,797 --> 00:44:26,258
Things are kind of--

718
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,386
They're a little fucked up,
is what they are.

719
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:32,556
We're just gettin' ready for
a big meetin' right now in Vegas.

720
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,187
Look, just let Eddie for now
set you up at Long Beach.

721
00:44:37,271 --> 00:44:40,566
Get you a job,
give you some cash...

722
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:43,778
and get this Scagnetti fuck
off your back...

723
00:44:43,862 --> 00:44:47,074
and then we'll talk
to you, all right?

724
00:44:47,158 --> 00:44:48,242
Huh?

725
00:44:48,326 --> 00:44:51,955
Dad, I got an idea.

726
00:44:52,038 --> 00:44:54,791
Just hear me out.

727
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:58,378
I know you don't like usin'
the boys on these jobs...

728
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:02,926
but Vic here-- I mean, he's only
been nothin' but good luck for us.

729
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:05,971
The guy's a fuckin' rabbit's foot,
for cryin' out loud.

730
00:45:07,181 --> 00:45:09,475
I'd like to have him in.

731
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:13,230
You know he can handle himself, and
you damn sure know you can trust him.

732
00:45:14,857 --> 00:45:16,901
All right, Vic...

733
00:45:16,985 --> 00:45:21,073
how would you feel about pullin'
a job with about five other guys?

734
00:45:23,742 --> 00:45:25,786
I'd feel great about it.

735
00:45:30,584 --> 00:45:34,296
K-BILLY's "Super Sounds
of the '70s" continues.

736
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,465
If you're the 12th caller...

737
00:45:36,549 --> 00:45:39,969
you'll win two tickets to
the monster truck extravaganza...

738
00:45:40,053 --> 00:45:43,306
being held tonight
at the Carson Fairgrounds...

739
00:45:43,391 --> 00:45:48,396
featuring Big Daddy Don Bodine's truck,
"The Behemoth."

740
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,360
The 12th caller wins on the station
where the '70s survived.

741
00:45:58,534 --> 00:46:01,996
Hey, Dov, we got
a major situation here.

742
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,583
I know you know that. I gotta talk to
Daddy and find out what he wants done.

743
00:46:13,426 --> 00:46:17,847
All I know is what Vic told me.
The place turned into a bullet-fest.

744
00:46:17,932 --> 00:46:20,393
He took a cop hostage
just to get the fuck outta there.

745
00:46:20,476 --> 00:46:22,436
Get up! Get up!

746
00:46:25,607 --> 00:46:27,776
Do I sound like
I'm fuckin' jokin'?

747
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:30,237
He's fuckin' drivin' around
with a cop in his trunk!

748
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:36,911
I don't know who did what!

749
00:46:36,996 --> 00:46:40,124
I don't know who's got the loot.
I don't know if anybody's got the loot.

750
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:44,087
I don't know who's dead, who's alive,
who's caught, who's not.

751
00:46:59,814 --> 00:47:02,775
I will know.
I'm practically there now.

752
00:47:03,986 --> 00:47:06,822
But what do I tell
these guys about Daddy?

753
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:12,246
All right.
You sure that's what he said?

754
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:15,958
Okay, that's what I'll tell 'em.

755
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:18,044
Huh? Fuck you!

756
00:47:18,128 --> 00:47:20,630
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?

757
00:47:20,714 --> 00:47:22,257
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?

758
00:47:25,553 --> 00:47:28,306
You're gonna suffer
for nothin', pal.

759
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,726
You hear me?
'Cause you're gonna fuckin' talk.

760
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:33,770
- I don't fucking know anything!
- You fuckin' know.

761
00:47:33,855 --> 00:47:36,399
You know. Look at me.
You fuckin' know.

762
00:47:36,483 --> 00:47:38,944
What in the Sam Hill's
goin' on here?

763
00:47:39,027 --> 00:47:42,113
- Nice Guy, we got a cop.
- Where the fuck is Joe?

764
00:47:43,366 --> 00:47:45,368
Holy shit. Orange is dead.

765
00:47:45,452 --> 00:47:49,331
No, he's not dead, but he will be
if we don't get him taken care of.

766
00:47:49,415 --> 00:47:51,834
We were set up.
The cops were there waitin' for us.

767
00:47:51,918 --> 00:47:54,254
What? Nobody fuckin'
set anybody up.

768
00:47:54,337 --> 00:47:55,963
The cops were there
waitin' for us.

769
00:47:56,047 --> 00:47:57,715
- Bullshit.
- Fuck you, man!

770
00:47:57,799 --> 00:48:01,136
You weren't there, we were,
and the cops had that store staked out.

771
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:04,515
Okay, Mr. Fuckin' Detective,
you're so fuckin' smart.

772
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:07,894
- Who did it?
- We've been askin' each other!

773
00:48:07,978 --> 00:48:10,981
What'd you come up with?
You think I fuckin' set you up?

774
00:48:11,065 --> 00:48:13,818
I don't know, but somebody did.

775
00:48:15,112 --> 00:48:18,657
Nobody did. You fuckin' assholes
turned the jewelry store--

776
00:48:18,741 --> 00:48:21,744
- Don't you call me an asshole!
- You fuckin' idiot!

777
00:48:21,828 --> 00:48:23,872
Turned the jewelry store
into a wild west show...

778
00:48:23,955 --> 00:48:26,374
and you wonder why
the fuckin' cops show up?

779
00:48:27,918 --> 00:48:29,336
Where's Joseph?

780
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,630
I don't know.
I ain't talked to him.

781
00:48:31,715 --> 00:48:36,136
I talked to Dov. He says Daddy's comin'
down here and he's fuckin' pissed.

782
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,681
He's pissed?
I told you he'd be pissed.

783
00:48:38,765 --> 00:48:40,225
What'd Joe say?

784
00:48:40,308 --> 00:48:42,226
I told you,
I ain't talked to him!

785
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:45,230
- All I know is he's pissed.
- What are you gonna do about him?

786
00:48:45,314 --> 00:48:49,360
Give me a fuckin' chance to breathe.
I got a few questions of my own here.

787
00:48:49,444 --> 00:48:50,904
You ain't dying. He is.

788
00:48:50,987 --> 00:48:54,491
All right, Mr. Fuckin' Compassion,
I will call somebody!

789
00:48:54,575 --> 00:48:56,327
Who?

790
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:59,830
A fuckin' snake charmer!
Who do you think? I'll call a doctor.

791
00:48:59,915 --> 00:49:03,794
They'll fix him right up.
What happened to Brown and Blue?

792
00:49:03,878 --> 00:49:06,130
Brown's dead.
We don't know what happened to Blue.

793
00:49:06,214 --> 00:49:08,091
Brown's dead? Are you sure?

794
00:49:08,174 --> 00:49:12,137
I'm sure. I was there.
He took one in the head.

795
00:49:12,221 --> 00:49:14,473
Nobody's got a clue
what happened to Mr. Blue?

796
00:49:14,557 --> 00:49:16,767
Either he's alive or he's dead...

797
00:49:16,851 --> 00:49:19,854
or the cops got him
or they don't.

798
00:49:22,817 --> 00:49:25,319
I take it this is the bastard
you told me about.

799
00:49:25,403 --> 00:49:27,321
Why are you beatin' on him?

800
00:49:27,405 --> 00:49:29,782
Maybe he could tell us
who set us up.

801
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:34,038
You beat this prick long enough, he'll
tell you he started the Chicago Fire.

802
00:49:34,122 --> 00:49:36,916
Now that don't necessarily
make it fuckin' so!

803
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,210
Come on, man, think!

804
00:49:39,294 --> 00:49:42,714
All right,
first things fuckin' last.

805
00:49:42,799 --> 00:49:47,262
Who's got the stones? Please, somebody
tell me one little fuckin' favor.

806
00:49:47,304 --> 00:49:48,889
I got a bag.

807
00:49:48,972 --> 00:49:53,018
Okay? I stashed it 'til we could be sure
this place wasn't a police station.

808
00:49:53,102 --> 00:49:55,354
Good for you.
Now let's go get it.

809
00:49:55,438 --> 00:49:59,693
First we gotta get rid of those cars.
It looks like Sam's Hot Car Lot outside.

810
00:49:59,777 --> 00:50:00,778
Okay.

811
00:50:00,862 --> 00:50:04,741
Blondie, stay here
and baby-sit them two.

812
00:50:04,825 --> 00:50:07,536
White and Pink,
take a car each.

813
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:11,165
I'll follow you. You ditch 'em.
Pick up the stones.

814
00:50:11,249 --> 00:50:14,377
While I'm followin' you, I'll arrange
some sort of a doctor for our friend.

815
00:50:14,461 --> 00:50:16,379
You can't leave these guys
here with him.

816
00:50:16,463 --> 00:50:19,925
- Why not?
- Because he's a fuckin' psycho.

817
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:23,304
And if you think
Joe's pissed off...

818
00:50:23,346 --> 00:50:26,266
that ain't nothin' compared
to how pissed off I am at him...

819
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:28,519
for puttin' me
in the same room as that bastard.

820
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:33,191
You see what I've been
puttin' up with, Eddie?

821
00:50:33,233 --> 00:50:38,280
I fuckin' walked in here,
I told these guys about stayin' put.

822
00:50:38,364 --> 00:50:41,367
Mr. White whips out his gun,
he's stickin' it in my face...

823
00:50:41,451 --> 00:50:45,288
callin' me a motherfucker,
sayin' he's gonna blow me away...

824
00:50:45,372 --> 00:50:47,541
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

825
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:51,003
He's the reason the joint
turned into a shootin' spree.

826
00:50:51,088 --> 00:50:53,674
What are you,
a fuckin' silent partner?

827
00:50:53,757 --> 00:50:55,550
Tell him!

828
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,179
He went crazy in the store,
but he seems all right now.

829
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:03,185
This is what he was doin':
bam, bam...

830
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:06,022
bam, bam.

831
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:08,399
Yeah, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

832
00:51:08,483 --> 00:51:11,569
I told 'em not to touch
the fuckin' alarm, they did.

833
00:51:11,653 --> 00:51:16,200
If they hadn't have done what I told 'em
not to do, they'd still be alive.

834
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:19,996
My fuckin' hero.

835
00:51:21,665 --> 00:51:23,709
Thanks.

836
00:51:23,793 --> 00:51:26,546
That's your excuse for going
on a kill-crazy rampage?

837
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:28,715
I don't like alarms, Mr. White.

838
00:51:32,261 --> 00:51:34,597
What does it matter
who stays with the cop?

839
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:36,724
We ain't lettin' him go.
He's seen everybody.

840
00:51:36,808 --> 00:51:38,852
I haven't been looking at you guys.

841
00:51:38,936 --> 00:51:41,397
Shut the fuck up, man!

842
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:44,317
You guys should never have taken him
outta the trunk in the first place.

843
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:48,447
- We tried to find out about the setup.
- There is no fuckin' setup!

844
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:50,240
Now here's the news!

845
00:51:50,324 --> 00:51:53,410
Blondie, you stay here,
take care of these two!

846
00:51:53,453 --> 00:51:55,747
White and Pink, you come with me,
'cause if Joe gets here...

847
00:51:55,831 --> 00:51:58,000
and he sees all these
cars parked outside...

848
00:51:58,083 --> 00:52:01,086
I swear to you he's gonna be
just as mad at me as he is at you.

849
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:03,255
Fine. Let's go.

850
00:52:23,989 --> 00:52:25,949
Alone at last.

851
00:52:47,392 --> 00:52:49,769
Guess what.

852
00:52:49,853 --> 00:52:52,522
I think I'm parked in the red zone.

853
00:52:57,695 --> 00:53:00,448
Now, where were we?

854
00:53:01,909 --> 00:53:05,287
I told you, I don't know anything
about any fuckin' setup.

855
00:53:06,789 --> 00:53:08,791
I've been on the force
for only eight months.

856
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:11,127
They don't tell me anything.

857
00:53:12,671 --> 00:53:15,674
Nobody tells me shit.
You can torture me all you want.

858
00:53:15,717 --> 00:53:18,011
Torture you?
That's a good--

859
00:53:18,095 --> 00:53:21,223
That's a good idea.
I like that one, yeah.

860
00:53:22,725 --> 00:53:25,895
Even your boss said
there wasn't a setup.

861
00:53:27,481 --> 00:53:30,567
- My what?
- Your boss.

862
00:53:31,652 --> 00:53:33,570
Excuse me, pal.

863
00:53:33,655 --> 00:53:37,659
One thing I wanna make clear to you:
I don't have a boss.

864
00:53:37,743 --> 00:53:40,829
Nobody tells me what to do.
You understand?

865
00:53:40,913 --> 00:53:43,415
You hear what I said,
you son of a bitch?

866
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,586
All right, all right, all right,
you don't have a boss.

867
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:51,759
Get that fuckin' shit off.

868
00:54:00,019 --> 00:54:03,105
Look, I'm not gonna
bullshit you, okay?

869
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:07,778
I don't really give a good fuck
what you know or don't know...

870
00:54:09,197 --> 00:54:11,741
but I'm gonna
torture you anyway...

871
00:54:13,744 --> 00:54:15,287
regardless.

872
00:54:15,371 --> 00:54:17,665
Not to get information.

873
00:54:19,292 --> 00:54:21,252
It's amusing to me...

874
00:54:21,336 --> 00:54:23,755
to torture a cop.

875
00:54:23,797 --> 00:54:27,009
You can say anything you want
because I've heard it all before.

876
00:54:28,636 --> 00:54:30,805
All you can do is...

877
00:54:30,847 --> 00:54:33,057
pray for a quick death...

878
00:54:35,686 --> 00:54:38,272
which...

879
00:54:38,356 --> 00:54:40,525
you ain't gonna get.

880
00:54:55,752 --> 00:54:57,545
Oh, God.

881
00:55:05,805 --> 00:55:09,809
You ever listen to K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s"?

882
00:55:13,231 --> 00:55:15,525
It's my personal favorite.

883
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:26,371
Joe Egan and Gerry Rafferty
were a duo known as Stealer's Wheel...

884
00:55:26,413 --> 00:55:30,542
when they recorded this Dylanesque,
pop, bubble-gum favorite...

885
00:55:30,626 --> 00:55:33,712
from April of 1974.

886
00:55:33,796 --> 00:55:35,714
That reached up to number five...

887
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:39,177
as K-BILLY's "Super Sounds
of the '70s" continues.

888
00:56:28,194 --> 00:56:30,321
Hold still.

889
00:56:30,405 --> 00:56:32,532
Hold still, you fuck.

890
00:56:52,973 --> 00:56:55,392
Was that good for you too?

891
00:56:56,144 --> 00:56:57,979
Hey, what's goin' on?

892
00:56:58,021 --> 00:56:59,481
You hear that?

893
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:12,412
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

894
00:58:56,619 --> 00:58:59,080
Don't! Stop! Stop!

895
00:59:00,457 --> 00:59:03,418
- What? What's the matter?
- Don't do this.

896
00:59:04,671 --> 00:59:06,589
That burn a little bit?

897
00:59:07,466 --> 00:59:09,092
Don't! Stop!

898
00:59:12,013 --> 00:59:13,806
Please stop.

899
00:59:13,848 --> 00:59:16,058
Just stop. Stop.

900
00:59:16,142 --> 00:59:18,060
Just talk to me.
Don't. Please.

901
00:59:18,145 --> 00:59:19,771
Don't burn me, please.

902
00:59:22,984 --> 00:59:26,613
I don't know anything about
any of you fucking guys.

903
00:59:26,697 --> 00:59:28,615
I'm not gonna say anything.

904
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:31,994
No! Please, no.

905
00:59:32,078 --> 00:59:33,579
- You all through?
- Stop!

906
00:59:33,663 --> 00:59:34,747
You all through?

907
00:59:34,831 --> 00:59:38,335
Please.
I got a little kid at home.

908
00:59:38,961 --> 00:59:40,129
You all done?

909
00:59:40,171 --> 00:59:42,131
- Don't!
- Have some fire.

910
01:00:46,249 --> 01:00:48,209
Oh, shit.

911
01:00:50,254 --> 01:00:51,714
Hey, you.

912
01:00:54,592 --> 01:00:56,886
What's your name?

913
01:01:00,099 --> 01:01:01,350
Marvin.

914
01:01:03,394 --> 01:01:04,603
Marvin what?

915
01:01:08,901 --> 01:01:10,402
Marvin Nash.

916
01:01:16,952 --> 01:01:18,870
Listen to me, Marvin.
I'm a--

917
01:01:21,624 --> 01:01:24,585
Listen to me, Marvin Nash.
I'm a cop.

918
01:01:26,463 --> 01:01:28,215
Yeah, I know.

919
01:01:30,718 --> 01:01:32,303
You do?

920
01:01:33,471 --> 01:01:36,766
Yeah.
Your name's Freddy somethin'.

921
01:01:37,893 --> 01:01:39,478
Newendyke.

922
01:01:40,688 --> 01:01:42,648
Freddy Newendyke.

923
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:48,655
Frankie Ferchetti...

924
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:52,618
introduced us
about five months ago.

925
01:01:55,539 --> 01:01:58,000
I don't remember that at all.

926
01:02:01,171 --> 01:02:03,089
I do.

927
01:02:06,093 --> 01:02:08,554
Freddy.

928
01:02:16,731 --> 01:02:18,691
How do I look?

929
01:02:21,445 --> 01:02:22,863
What?

930
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:33,417
I don't know what to tell you,
Marvin.

931
01:02:37,046 --> 01:02:38,631
That fuck.

932
01:02:41,176 --> 01:02:43,595
That sick fuck!

933
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:46,599
That fuckin' bastard!

934
01:02:48,518 --> 01:02:51,938
Marvin, I need you to hold on.

935
01:02:52,023 --> 01:02:54,943
There's cops waiting to move
a block away.

936
01:02:56,027 --> 01:02:59,113
What the fuck
are they waiting for?

937
01:02:59,198 --> 01:03:02,410
This fuckin' guy,
he slashes my face...

938
01:03:02,451 --> 01:03:04,953
and cuts my fuckin' ear off!

939
01:03:05,038 --> 01:03:07,248
I'm fuckin' deformed!

940
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:08,876
Fuck you!

941
01:03:10,252 --> 01:03:12,254
I'm fuckin' dyin' here!

942
01:03:12,338 --> 01:03:14,423
I'm fuckin' dyin'!

943
01:03:22,851 --> 01:03:26,897
They're not to make a move
'til Joe Cabot shows up.

944
01:03:26,939 --> 01:03:29,775
I was sent in to get him.

945
01:03:29,817 --> 01:03:31,402
All right?

946
01:03:31,486 --> 01:03:34,447
You heard 'em.
They said he's on his way.

947
01:03:34,489 --> 01:03:36,950
Don't pussy out on me now,
Marvin.

948
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:41,164
We're just gonna sit here
and bleed...

949
01:03:41,247 --> 01:03:44,667
'til Joe Cabot sticks
his fuckin' head through that door.

950
01:04:05,401 --> 01:04:07,653
Say hello to a motherfucker
who's inside.

951
01:04:07,737 --> 01:04:10,573
Cabot's doing a job.
He wants me on the team.

952
01:04:10,657 --> 01:04:13,118
This better not be a joke.

953
01:04:13,202 --> 01:04:16,873
This ain't a joke.
I'm in. I'm up his ass.

954
01:04:24,507 --> 01:04:27,427
Nice Guy Eddie tells me
Joe wants to meet me.

955
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:31,431
He says I should just wait
for a phone call.

956
01:04:31,515 --> 01:04:35,853
After waiting three days he calls me
last night and says Joe's ready.

957
01:04:35,937 --> 01:04:38,940
- He'll pick me up in 15 minutes.
- Who picked you up?

958
01:04:39,024 --> 01:04:41,652
- Nice Guy. We get to a bar.
- What bar?

959
01:04:41,694 --> 01:04:43,237
Smokey Pete's in Gardena.

960
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:44,864
We get there...

961
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:47,951
and I meet Joe
and a guy named Mr. White.

962
01:04:48,035 --> 01:04:49,953
Phony name.
My name's Mr. Orange.

963
01:04:50,037 --> 01:04:52,790
- Mr. Orange?
- Mr. Orange.

964
01:04:54,042 --> 01:04:55,960
Okay, Mr. Orange.

965
01:04:56,044 --> 01:04:59,715
- You ever see this motherfucker before?
- Who? Mr. White?

966
01:04:59,798 --> 01:05:01,424
Yes. Mr. White.

967
01:05:02,135 --> 01:05:07,057
No. He ain't one of Cabot's men either.
He's gotta be from out of town.

968
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,309
- Joe knows him good.
- How can you tell?

969
01:05:09,393 --> 01:05:12,396
The way they talk.
You can tell they're buddies.

970
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,565
- You two talk?
- Me and Joe?

971
01:05:15,442 --> 01:05:16,651
Mr. White.

972
01:05:16,735 --> 01:05:18,278
- A little.
- About what?

973
01:05:18,362 --> 01:05:19,446
The Brewers.

974
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:20,906
Milwaukee Brewers?

975
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:24,076
They won the night before.
He made some money off them.

976
01:05:24,161 --> 01:05:28,958
Good. If this crook's a Brewers fan,
he's gotta be from Wisconsin.

977
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:31,835
And I'll bet you everything...

978
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,006
they got a sheet in Milwaukee
on this Mr. White's ass.

979
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:39,386
So I want you to go through
everybody in Milwaukee...

980
01:05:39,429 --> 01:05:42,891
with a history of armed robbery
and put a name to the face.

981
01:05:42,974 --> 01:05:45,476
- Nice work, Freddy.
- Thank you, my man.

982
01:05:46,729 --> 01:05:49,231
- How was Long Beach Mike's referral?
- Perfect.

983
01:05:49,274 --> 01:05:53,529
His backing me up went a long way.
I told them I played poker with him.

984
01:05:53,612 --> 01:05:56,532
Nice Guy checked it out
and said it was A-okay.

985
01:05:56,616 --> 01:05:59,536
Said I was a good thief,
I didn't rattle...

986
01:05:59,619 --> 01:06:01,955
and that I was ready to move.

987
01:06:02,039 --> 01:06:04,708
He's a good guy.
I wouldn't be inside without him.

988
01:06:06,794 --> 01:06:09,171
Long Beach Mike
is not your friend.

989
01:06:09,255 --> 01:06:11,507
Long Beach Mike
is a fucking scumbag.

990
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:13,510
He's selling out his friends.

991
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:16,388
That's how nice he fuckin' is.

992
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,432
I'll take care of his ass...

993
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:22,353
but you get that scumbag out of mind
and take care of business.

994
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:24,023
Gone.

995
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:31,740
Use the commode story?

996
01:06:31,824 --> 01:06:35,286
- What's the commode story?
- It's a scene. Memorize it.

997
01:06:37,247 --> 01:06:40,542
- A what?
- Undercover cops gotta be Brando.

998
01:06:40,626 --> 01:06:43,838
To do this job you gotta be
a great actor, naturalistic.

999
01:06:43,921 --> 01:06:46,674
You gotta be naturalistic as hell.

1000
01:06:46,716 --> 01:06:51,680
If you're a bad actor,
that's bullshit in this job.

1001
01:06:51,764 --> 01:06:53,098
What is this?

1002
01:06:53,182 --> 01:06:56,102
That's an amusing anecdote
about a drug deal.

1003
01:06:58,230 --> 01:07:02,485
Something funny that happened to you
while you were doing a job.

1004
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:05,905
I gotta memorize all this?
There's four pages of this shit.

1005
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:08,658
Think about it like it's a joke.

1006
01:07:08,701 --> 01:07:11,871
Memorize what's important.
The rest you make your own.

1007
01:07:11,955 --> 01:07:13,873
You can tell a joke,
can't you?

1008
01:07:15,042 --> 01:07:16,960
Well, pretend you're Don Rickles...

1009
01:07:17,044 --> 01:07:18,962
and tell a joke, all right?

1010
01:07:19,046 --> 01:07:21,840
The things you gotta remember
are the details.

1011
01:07:21,883 --> 01:07:23,885
The details sell your story.

1012
01:07:23,969 --> 01:07:27,014
This particular story
takes place in a men's room.

1013
01:07:27,097 --> 01:07:29,725
You gotta know
all the details--

1014
01:07:29,809 --> 01:07:33,646
whether they got paper towels
or a blower to dry your hands.

1015
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:37,401
You gotta know if the stalls
ain't got no doors or not.

1016
01:07:37,443 --> 01:07:40,529
You gotta know if they got liquid soap
or that pink, granulated shit...

1017
01:07:40,613 --> 01:07:42,573
they used in high school.

1018
01:07:42,616 --> 01:07:45,577
You gotta know if they got
hot water or not, if it stinks...

1019
01:07:45,619 --> 01:07:48,997
if some nasty, lowlife,
scum-ridden motherfucker...

1020
01:07:49,082 --> 01:07:51,501
sprayed diarrhea
all over one of the bowls.

1021
01:07:51,585 --> 01:07:54,963
You gotta know every detail
there is to know about this commode.

1022
01:07:55,047 --> 01:07:59,927
What you gotta do is take
all them details and make 'em your own.

1023
01:08:00,011 --> 01:08:03,890
While you're doing that, remember
that this story is about you...

1024
01:08:03,933 --> 01:08:07,186
and how you perceived
the events that went down.

1025
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:09,188
The only way to do that...

1026
01:08:10,273 --> 01:08:12,191
is keep sayin' it...

1027
01:08:12,276 --> 01:08:14,695
and sayin' it and sayin' it.

1028
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:22,997
This is during
the L.A. marijuana drought, 1986.

1029
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:26,458
I still had a connection,
which was insane 'cause...

1030
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:28,711
you couldn't get any weed
anywhere then.

1031
01:08:30,255 --> 01:08:34,176
Anyway, I had a connection with
this hippie chick in Santa Cruz...

1032
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:36,178
and all my friends knew it.

1033
01:08:36,262 --> 01:08:38,931
They call me and say,
"Hey, Freddy--"

1034
01:08:40,601 --> 01:08:42,728
I say, "Hey, dude.

1035
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:46,983
You gettin' some?
Can you get some for me too?"

1036
01:08:47,067 --> 01:08:51,822
They knew I still smoked,
so they asked me to buy some for them.

1037
01:08:51,864 --> 01:08:53,324
It got to be--

1038
01:08:58,998 --> 01:09:03,378
Every time I bought some weed
I was buyin' for four or five people.

1039
01:09:03,461 --> 01:09:08,049
Finally I said, fuck this shit.
I'm makin' this bitch rich.

1040
01:09:08,133 --> 01:09:11,511
She didn't even have to
meet these people.

1041
01:09:11,596 --> 01:09:13,514
I was doing all the work.

1042
01:09:13,598 --> 01:09:17,936
That got to be a pain in the ass,
people calling all the time.

1043
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:21,691
I couldn't even rent a tape
without six fuckin' interruptions.

1044
01:09:21,775 --> 01:09:23,860
"When's the next time
you're gettin' some?"

1045
01:09:23,944 --> 01:09:26,363
"Motherfucker, I'm tryin'
to watch The Lost Boys.

1046
01:09:26,405 --> 01:09:28,365
When I get some,
I'll call you."

1047
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:31,869
Then these rink-a-dink
potheads come by.

1048
01:09:31,953 --> 01:09:34,414
They're my friends and everything,
but still--

1049
01:09:34,498 --> 01:09:37,876
I got it laid out in 60-dollar bags,
they don't want 60 dollars worth.

1050
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:41,297
They want ten dollars' worth,
and breaking it up wasn't easy.

1051
01:09:41,381 --> 01:09:44,968
I don't even know
what ten dollars' worth looks like.

1052
01:09:45,052 --> 01:09:47,221
This was a very weird situation.

1053
01:09:48,431 --> 01:09:50,641
Remember back in '86...

1054
01:09:50,725 --> 01:09:53,061
there was a major
fuckin' drought.

1055
01:09:53,145 --> 01:09:54,563
Nobody had anything.

1056
01:09:54,647 --> 01:09:57,942
People were livin' on resin,
smokin' the wood in their pipes.

1057
01:09:58,026 --> 01:10:01,947
This chick had a bunch
and she's beggin' me to sell it.

1058
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:04,950
So I told her I wasn't gonna be
Joe the pot man anymore...

1059
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:08,913
but I would take a little bit
and sell it to my close friends.

1060
01:10:08,997 --> 01:10:11,541
She agreed and we kept
the same arrangement as before--

1061
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:13,543
ten percent
and free pot for me...

1062
01:10:13,586 --> 01:10:15,546
if I helped her
that weekend.

1063
01:10:15,588 --> 01:10:18,925
She was sellin' a brick of weed
and didn't wanna go to the buy alone.

1064
01:10:18,967 --> 01:10:22,471
Her brother usually goes with her,
but he's in County unexpectedly.

1065
01:10:22,555 --> 01:10:23,639
What for?

1066
01:10:23,723 --> 01:10:25,558
His traffic tickets
gone to warrant.

1067
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,437
They stopped him, found warrants
on him, took him to County.

1068
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,441
She doesn't wanna walk around alone
with all that weed.

1069
01:10:32,483 --> 01:10:36,279
I don't wanna do this.
I have a very bad feeling about it.

1070
01:10:36,363 --> 01:10:38,323
She keeps asking me, asking me.

1071
01:10:38,407 --> 01:10:41,327
Finally I said okay
'cause I'm sick of hearing it.

1072
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:43,662
- So we go to the train station--
- Wait.

1073
01:10:43,746 --> 01:10:46,749
You're goin' to the train station
with the weed on ya?

1074
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:49,002
The guy needed it right away.

1075
01:10:49,086 --> 01:10:51,422
Anyway, we get to
the train station...

1076
01:10:51,464 --> 01:10:53,424
and we're waitin' for the guy.

1077
01:10:53,466 --> 01:10:56,094
I'm carryin' the weed
in a carry-on bag.

1078
01:10:56,136 --> 01:11:00,849
I gotta take a piss, so I tell her
I'm goin' to the boy's room.

1079
01:11:05,147 --> 01:11:08,108
So I walk into the men's room
and who's standing there?

1080
01:11:09,777 --> 01:11:13,197
Four Los Angeles County sheriffs
and a German shepherd.

1081
01:11:15,409 --> 01:11:18,871
- They're waitin' for you?
- No, they're just talkin'.

1082
01:11:18,955 --> 01:11:21,958
When I walked in,
they all stopped talkin'...

1083
01:11:22,042 --> 01:11:24,419
and they looked at me.

1084
01:11:24,503 --> 01:11:27,297
That's hard.
That's a fuckin' hard situation.

1085
01:11:28,341 --> 01:11:30,009
German shepherd starts barking.

1086
01:11:31,761 --> 01:11:33,304
He's barkin' at me.

1087
01:11:33,388 --> 01:11:35,974
I mean, it's obvious
he's barkin' at me.

1088
01:11:37,894 --> 01:11:41,690
Every nerve ending, all of my senses,
the blood in the veins was screamin':

1089
01:11:41,732 --> 01:11:45,736
"Take off, man. Just bail.
Get the fuck outta there."

1090
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:48,322
Panic hits me
like a bucket of water.

1091
01:11:48,364 --> 01:11:49,865
Bam! Right in the face.

1092
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:54,872
I'm drenched in panic and these cops
are lookin' at me and they know it.

1093
01:11:54,956 --> 01:11:58,376
They can smell it,
sure as that fuckin' dog can.

1094
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:00,378
They can smell it on me.

1095
01:12:01,255 --> 01:12:02,840
Shut up.

1096
01:12:04,216 --> 01:12:07,344
So anyway,
I got my gun drawn.

1097
01:12:07,387 --> 01:12:10,348
I point it at this guy
and I tell him...

1098
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:12,851
"Freeze.
Don't fuckin' move."

1099
01:12:12,893 --> 01:12:15,896
This little idiot's
looking right at me and saying...

1100
01:12:15,939 --> 01:12:17,774
"I know, I know."

1101
01:12:17,858 --> 01:12:21,278
But meanwhile his right hand
is creepin' toward the glove box.

1102
01:12:21,362 --> 01:12:26,201
I scream at him, "Asshole!
I'm gonna blow you away right now!

1103
01:12:26,243 --> 01:12:28,370
Put your hands on the dash."

1104
01:12:28,412 --> 01:12:31,457
He's still looking at me,
nodding his head.

1105
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:33,876
"I know, buddy, I know."

1106
01:12:33,918 --> 01:12:37,672
Meanwhile his hand is still
going for the glove box.

1107
01:12:37,756 --> 01:12:39,382
And I said...

1108
01:12:39,466 --> 01:12:43,345
"Buddy, I'm gonna shoot you
in the face...

1109
01:12:43,429 --> 01:12:46,140
if you don't put your hands up."

1110
01:12:47,601 --> 01:12:51,730
Then this guy's girlfriend,
this real sexy Oriental bitch...

1111
01:12:51,773 --> 01:12:55,068
she starts screaming at him:
"Chuck, what are you doin'?

1112
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:58,405
Listen to the officer!
Put your hands on the dash!"

1113
01:12:58,447 --> 01:13:02,702
So then the guy snaps out of it
and puts his hands on the dash.

1114
01:13:02,786 --> 01:13:04,162
What was he goin' for?

1115
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:06,498
His fucking registration.

1116
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:09,418
- You're kidding.
- No, man!

1117
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:13,089
Stupid citizen doesn't know how close
he came to gettin' blown away.

1118
01:13:13,173 --> 01:13:14,633
That close, man.

1119
01:13:48,214 --> 01:13:50,174
You knew how to handle
that situation.

1120
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:53,178
You shit your pants,
dive in and swim.

1121
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:57,767
Tell me more about Cabot.

1122
01:13:57,851 --> 01:13:59,686
I don't know.

1123
01:13:59,728 --> 01:14:01,730
He's a cool guy.

1124
01:14:03,441 --> 01:14:06,110
He's funny.
He's a funny guy.

1125
01:14:06,861 --> 01:14:09,071
You remember
the Fantastic Four?

1126
01:14:10,157 --> 01:14:12,075
Yeah, with that invisible bitch...

1127
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:14,077
and "Flame on"
and shit, right?

1128
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:16,539
Thing.

1129
01:14:17,207 --> 01:14:18,458
Motherfucker...

1130
01:14:18,542 --> 01:14:20,502
Iooks just like the Thing.

1131
01:14:24,758 --> 01:14:27,344
Hey! Showtime!

1132
01:14:27,386 --> 01:14:30,306
Grab your jacket.
I'm parked outside.

1133
01:14:30,389 --> 01:14:32,224
I'll be right down.

1134
01:14:33,726 --> 01:14:34,977
He'll be right down.

1135
01:15:54,989 --> 01:15:57,116
Don't pussy out on me now.

1136
01:15:57,158 --> 01:15:59,118
They don't know.

1137
01:15:59,161 --> 01:16:01,413
They don't know shit.

1138
01:16:01,497 --> 01:16:04,625
You're not gonna get hurt.
You're fuckin' Baretta.

1139
01:16:04,667 --> 01:16:08,129
They believe every fuckin' word
'cause you're super cool.

1140
01:16:15,513 --> 01:16:16,973
There goes our boy.

1141
01:16:17,015 --> 01:16:20,143
The guy has to have rocks in his head
the size of Gibraltar...

1142
01:16:20,227 --> 01:16:21,687
to work undercover.

1143
01:16:21,729 --> 01:16:24,690
- You want one of these?
- Yeah, give me the bear claw.

1144
01:16:40,751 --> 01:16:42,711
I know what I'm talking about.

1145
01:16:42,754 --> 01:16:45,423
Black women ain't the same
as white women.

1146
01:16:45,507 --> 01:16:46,925
There's a slight difference.

1147
01:16:47,009 --> 01:16:49,762
Very funny.
You know what I mean.

1148
01:16:49,846 --> 01:16:53,308
What a white bitch will put up with,
a black bitch wouldn't for a minute.

1149
01:16:53,391 --> 01:16:56,227
If you cross their line,
they fuck you up.

1150
01:16:56,312 --> 01:16:58,856
I gotta go along with Pink
on that.

1151
01:16:58,898 --> 01:17:01,692
Okay, Mr. Expert,
if this is such a truism...

1152
01:17:01,735 --> 01:17:06,198
why is it that every nigger I know
treats his woman like a piece of shit?

1153
01:17:06,282 --> 01:17:09,744
I'll bet those same niggers
who show their ass in public...

1154
01:17:09,828 --> 01:17:12,748
when their bitches get 'em home
they chill the fuck out.

1155
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:15,917
- Not these guys.
- Oh, yeah. Those guys too.

1156
01:17:16,001 --> 01:17:18,045
Tell you guys a story.

1157
01:17:18,087 --> 01:17:22,926
In one of Daddy's clubs there's
a black cocktail waitress named Elois.

1158
01:17:22,968 --> 01:17:25,012
- Elois?
- Yeah, Elois.

1159
01:17:25,096 --> 01:17:28,641
E and Lois.
We called her Lady E.

1160
01:17:28,725 --> 01:17:30,643
Where was she from?
Compton?

1161
01:17:32,771 --> 01:17:34,189
She's from Ladora Heights.

1162
01:17:34,273 --> 01:17:36,692
Ladora Heights.
The black Beverly Hills.

1163
01:17:37,777 --> 01:17:40,071
It's not
the black Beverly Hills.

1164
01:17:40,113 --> 01:17:42,699
It's the black Palos Verdes.

1165
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,618
Anyway...

1166
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:49,081
Lady E, she was a man-eater-upper.
Un-fuckin'-believable.

1167
01:17:49,124 --> 01:17:53,963
Every guy who ever saw her
had to jack off to her at least once.

1168
01:17:54,005 --> 01:17:56,966
You know who she looked like?
Christie Love.

1169
01:17:57,050 --> 01:17:58,968
Remember that TV show
Get Christie Love...

1170
01:17:59,052 --> 01:18:01,346
about the black female cop?

1171
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:04,350
She always used to say,
"You're under arrest, sugar! "

1172
01:18:06,478 --> 01:18:09,314
- Who played Christie Love?
- Pam Grier.

1173
01:18:09,356 --> 01:18:12,317
No, it wasn't Pam Grier.
Pam Grier was the other one.

1174
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,320
Pam Grier did the film.

1175
01:18:14,362 --> 01:18:19,034
Christie Love was like
a Pam Grier TV show without Pam Grier.

1176
01:18:19,118 --> 01:18:22,330
- So, who was Christie Love?
- How should I know?

1177
01:18:22,372 --> 01:18:24,332
Great. Now I'm totally
fuckin' tortured.

1178
01:18:24,374 --> 01:18:27,669
Whoever it was,
she looked exactly like Elois.

1179
01:18:27,753 --> 01:18:29,171
Anne Francis.

1180
01:18:29,255 --> 01:18:31,924
No. That was Honey West.

1181
01:18:32,008 --> 01:18:33,760
Anne Francis is white.

1182
01:18:33,843 --> 01:18:38,098
I'm tryin' to tell a story here.
She looked exactly like Elois.

1183
01:18:38,182 --> 01:18:40,726
We come into the club
one night...

1184
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:42,728
and there's Carlos,
the bartender.

1185
01:18:42,812 --> 01:18:45,982
He's a wetback.
He's a friend of mine.

1186
01:18:46,024 --> 01:18:48,693
I says to him,
"Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?"

1187
01:18:49,779 --> 01:18:51,781
Apparently Lady E...

1188
01:18:51,865 --> 01:18:55,160
was married to real piece
of dog shit, a real animal.

1189
01:18:55,202 --> 01:18:57,454
He used to do things to her.

1190
01:18:57,538 --> 01:18:59,498
Like what?
What would he do?

1191
01:18:59,582 --> 01:19:01,292
Beat her up?

1192
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:04,212
I don't know.
He just did things.

1193
01:19:04,254 --> 01:19:07,966
So anyway, one night
she plays it real cool.

1194
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:10,386
She waits for him to get drunk.

1195
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:13,390
He falls asleep
on the fuckin' couch.

1196
01:19:13,432 --> 01:19:17,770
She sneaks up on him,
puts some glue on his dick...

1197
01:19:17,854 --> 01:19:20,023
and glues his dick
to his belly.

1198
01:19:21,149 --> 01:19:22,901
Jesus Christ!

1199
01:19:22,985 --> 01:19:25,779
I'm serious, man.
I'm dead serious.

1200
01:19:25,863 --> 01:19:29,158
They had to call the paramedics
to cut the prick loose.

1201
01:19:30,494 --> 01:19:32,412
Was he all pissed off?

1202
01:19:34,457 --> 01:19:38,712
How would you feel if you had to do
a fuckin' handstand to take a piss?

1203
01:19:43,008 --> 01:19:46,929
You guys like to tell jokes
and giggle and kid around, huh?

1204
01:19:47,013 --> 01:19:49,933
Giggling like a bunch of girls
in the schoolyard.

1205
01:19:49,975 --> 01:19:51,935
Well, let me tell a joke.

1206
01:19:52,979 --> 01:19:55,690
Five guys
sittin' in a bullpen...

1207
01:19:55,774 --> 01:19:57,609
San Quentin...

1208
01:19:57,692 --> 01:20:00,612
wonderin' how the fuck
they got there.

1209
01:20:00,696 --> 01:20:04,033
"What did we do wrong?
What shouldn't we have done?

1210
01:20:04,117 --> 01:20:06,035
It's your fault, his fault--"

1211
01:20:06,119 --> 01:20:07,871
All that bullshit.

1212
01:20:07,955 --> 01:20:09,707
Finally somebody says...

1213
01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:12,000
"Wait a minute.

1214
01:20:12,084 --> 01:20:14,086
While we were
planning this caper...

1215
01:20:14,129 --> 01:20:16,673
we just sat around
tellin' fuckin' jokes."

1216
01:20:16,757 --> 01:20:18,467
Got the message?

1217
01:20:20,761 --> 01:20:22,679
I don't mean to holler at ya.

1218
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:27,310
When this caper's over,
and I'm sure it'll be successful...

1219
01:20:27,394 --> 01:20:30,772
we'll go down to Hawaiian lslands,
I'll laugh with all of youse.

1220
01:20:30,815 --> 01:20:32,900
Find me a different character
down there.

1221
01:20:32,984 --> 01:20:35,320
Right now it's a matter
of business.

1222
01:20:36,488 --> 01:20:38,907
With the exception
of Eddie and myself...

1223
01:20:38,991 --> 01:20:40,743
who you already know...

1224
01:20:40,827 --> 01:20:43,663
we're gonna be using aliases
on this job.

1225
01:20:43,705 --> 01:20:46,207
Under no circumstances...

1226
01:20:46,292 --> 01:20:49,462
do we want any one of you
to relate to each other...

1227
01:20:49,504 --> 01:20:51,756
by your Christian names.

1228
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:56,220
And I don't want any talk
about yourself personally.

1229
01:20:56,303 --> 01:21:00,182
That includes where you been,
your wife's name...

1230
01:21:00,266 --> 01:21:02,184
where you might've done time...

1231
01:21:02,269 --> 01:21:06,106
or a bank maybe you robbed
in St. Petersburg.

1232
01:21:06,190 --> 01:21:10,111
All I want you guys to talk about,
if you have to...

1233
01:21:10,195 --> 01:21:12,781
is what you're gonna do.

1234
01:21:12,865 --> 01:21:15,034
That should do it.

1235
01:21:15,117 --> 01:21:17,536
These are your names--

1236
01:21:17,579 --> 01:21:20,540
Mr. Brown, Mr. White...

1237
01:21:20,582 --> 01:21:23,043
Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue...

1238
01:21:23,127 --> 01:21:25,296
Mr. Orange and Mr. Pink.

1239
01:21:25,379 --> 01:21:29,008
- Why am I Mr. Pink?
- Because you're a faggot! All right?

1240
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:33,263
- Why can't we pick our own colors?
- No way.

1241
01:21:33,347 --> 01:21:36,016
No way. Tried it once.
It doesn't work.

1242
01:21:36,059 --> 01:21:39,521
You get four guys all fightin'
over who gets to be Mr. Black.

1243
01:21:39,563 --> 01:21:42,983
They don't know each other,
so nobody wants to back down.

1244
01:21:43,067 --> 01:21:45,403
No way. I pick.
You're Mr. Pink.

1245
01:21:45,486 --> 01:21:47,613
Be thankful
you're not Mr. Yellow.

1246
01:21:48,782 --> 01:21:51,076
But Mr. Brown,
that's too close to Mr. Shit.

1247
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:53,078
Mr. Pink
sounds like Mr. Pussy.

1248
01:21:53,162 --> 01:21:55,039
How about Mr. Purple?

1249
01:21:55,081 --> 01:21:57,083
That's sounds good.
I'll be Mr. Purple.

1250
01:21:57,167 --> 01:21:59,586
You're not Mr. Purple.

1251
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:03,925
Some guy on some other job
is Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink!

1252
01:22:04,008 --> 01:22:05,760
Who cares what your name is?

1253
01:22:05,844 --> 01:22:09,473
Easy for you to say. You're Mr. White.
You have a cool-sounding name.

1254
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:13,269
If it's no big deal to be Mr. Pink,
you wanna trade?

1255
01:22:13,311 --> 01:22:16,105
Nobody's tradin' with anybody.

1256
01:22:16,148 --> 01:22:19,318
This ain't a goddamn fuckin'
city council meeting, you know.

1257
01:22:21,154 --> 01:22:23,114
Now listen up, Mr. Pink.

1258
01:22:23,198 --> 01:22:25,742
There's two ways you can go
on this job--

1259
01:22:25,784 --> 01:22:28,078
my way or the highway.

1260
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:30,205
What's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?

1261
01:22:30,957 --> 01:22:33,918
Jesus Christ, Joe.
Fuckin' forget about it.

1262
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:36,629
It's beneath me.
I'm Mr. Pink. Let's move on.

1263
01:22:36,714 --> 01:22:39,634
I'll move on
when I feel like it.

1264
01:22:39,717 --> 01:22:42,637
Do all you guys
got the goddamn message?

1265
01:22:44,306 --> 01:22:48,269
I'm so goddamn mad hollerin'
at you guys, I can hardly talk.

1266
01:22:49,646 --> 01:22:51,731
Let's go to work.

1267
01:22:51,815 --> 01:22:54,651
Let's go over it.
Where are you?

1268
01:22:54,693 --> 01:22:58,280
I stand outside and guard the door.
I don't let anybody go in or out.

1269
01:22:59,032 --> 01:23:01,201
- Mr. Brown.
- He waits in the car.

1270
01:23:01,284 --> 01:23:04,788
I give him the signal,
he pulls up in front.

1271
01:23:04,872 --> 01:23:07,082
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue.

1272
01:23:07,166 --> 01:23:10,795
Crowd control. They handle
the customers and the employees.

1273
01:23:10,837 --> 01:23:14,049
- That girl's ass.
- Sittin' right here on my dick.

1274
01:23:16,552 --> 01:23:18,512
Myself and Mr. Pink?

1275
01:23:18,596 --> 01:23:22,725
You two take the manager
and make him give you the diamonds.

1276
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:24,937
We're there
for those stones, period.

1277
01:23:25,021 --> 01:23:28,483
Since no display cases are being
fucked with, no alarms should go off.

1278
01:23:29,735 --> 01:23:32,696
We're out in two minutes,
not one second longer.

1279
01:23:33,906 --> 01:23:36,867
What if the manager
won't give you the diamonds?

1280
01:23:37,953 --> 01:23:41,415
A store like this
is insured up the ass.

1281
01:23:41,499 --> 01:23:44,419
They're not supposed to give you
any resistance whatsoever.

1282
01:23:44,502 --> 01:23:48,256
If you get a customer or an employee
who thinks he's Charles Bronson...

1283
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:50,717
smash their nose with your gun.

1284
01:23:50,759 --> 01:23:53,261
Drops him right to the floor.
Everyone jumps.

1285
01:23:53,346 --> 01:23:56,266
He falls down screaming,
blood squirts out of his nose.

1286
01:23:56,349 --> 01:23:59,269
Freaks everybody out.
Nobody says fuckin' shit after that.

1287
01:24:00,438 --> 01:24:02,899
Some bitch might
talk shit to you.

1288
01:24:02,941 --> 01:24:06,904
Give her a look like she's next.
Watch her shut the fuck up.

1289
01:24:08,072 --> 01:24:10,741
If it's the manager,
that's different.

1290
01:24:10,825 --> 01:24:13,077
The managers know not
to fuck around...

1291
01:24:13,161 --> 01:24:15,455
so if he's giving you static...

1292
01:24:15,539 --> 01:24:19,752
he probably thinks he's a real cowboy
so you gotta that bastard in two.

1293
01:24:19,794 --> 01:24:23,757
If he won't tell ya something,
cut off one of his fingers.

1294
01:24:23,798 --> 01:24:27,093
The little one.
Then tell him his thumb's next.

1295
01:24:27,136 --> 01:24:30,097
After that he'll tell you
if he wears ladies underwear.

1296
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:36,062
I'm hungry.
Let's get a taco.

1297
01:24:51,706 --> 01:24:52,623
Fuck.

1298
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:12,898
Jesus.

1299
01:25:12,982 --> 01:25:15,192
I'm blind, man.
I'm fuckin' blind.

1300
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:17,695
No, you just got
blood in your eyes.

1301
01:25:30,878 --> 01:25:32,212
Is he dead?

1302
01:25:33,589 --> 01:25:35,507
Did he die or not?

1303
01:25:36,718 --> 01:25:38,178
Let's go.

1304
01:26:12,802 --> 01:26:15,138
Hold it! Get out!

1305
01:26:16,765 --> 01:26:18,725
Get out of the fuckin' car!

1306
01:26:34,244 --> 01:26:36,413
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Larry.

1307
01:26:37,498 --> 01:26:39,416
I can't believe she killed me.

1308
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,043
Who'd have fucking thought that?

1309
01:26:41,086 --> 01:26:43,755
Hey, just cancel that shit
right now.

1310
01:26:43,839 --> 01:26:46,759
You're hurt.
You're hurt real fuckin' bad.

1311
01:26:46,842 --> 01:26:48,594
But you ain't dying.

1312
01:26:49,888 --> 01:26:52,808
All this blood's scaring
the shit out of me, Larry.

1313
01:26:54,101 --> 01:26:56,061
I'm gonna die.
I know it.

1314
01:27:31,145 --> 01:27:32,605
What the fuck happened?

1315
01:27:32,688 --> 01:27:36,651
He slashed the cop's face, cut off
his ear and was gonna burn him alive.

1316
01:27:37,945 --> 01:27:40,155
What? I didn't hear you.

1317
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:41,657
I said...

1318
01:27:43,493 --> 01:27:45,078
Blonde went crazy.

1319
01:27:45,161 --> 01:27:50,417
He slashed the cop's face, cut off
his ear and was gonna burn him alive.

1320
01:27:50,501 --> 01:27:51,752
This cop?

1321
01:27:56,842 --> 01:27:58,886
He went crazy?
Something like that?

1322
01:27:58,969 --> 01:28:01,054
Worse or better?

1323
01:28:01,139 --> 01:28:04,351
Eddie, he was
pulling a burn, man.

1324
01:28:05,602 --> 01:28:07,604
He was gonna kill
the cop and me.

1325
01:28:07,688 --> 01:28:11,525
When you guys walked in, he was gonna
kill you and run with the diamonds.

1326
01:28:12,193 --> 01:28:13,277
What'd I tell ya?

1327
01:28:13,361 --> 01:28:16,906
That sick piece of shit
was a stone-cold psycho.

1328
01:28:16,991 --> 01:28:20,203
You should've asked the cop,
not just killed him.

1329
01:28:20,286 --> 01:28:23,915
He talked about what he was gonna do
when he was slicing him up.

1330
01:28:25,459 --> 01:28:27,211
I don't buy it.

1331
01:28:27,253 --> 01:28:28,713
Doesn't make sense.

1332
01:28:33,010 --> 01:28:35,471
Makes perfect fuckin' sense
to me.

1333
01:28:35,554 --> 01:28:39,099
You didn't see how he acted
during the job. We did.

1334
01:28:39,184 --> 01:28:41,353
He's right.
The ear's hacked off.

1335
01:28:41,436 --> 01:28:45,607
Let me just say this out loud,
'cause I wanna get this straight.

1336
01:28:46,567 --> 01:28:48,527
You're saying that Mr. Blonde...

1337
01:28:48,570 --> 01:28:49,738
was gonna kill you...

1338
01:28:49,821 --> 01:28:53,033
and then when we got back
he was gonna kill us...

1339
01:28:53,075 --> 01:28:55,035
take the diamonds and scram.

1340
01:28:55,077 --> 01:28:58,289
I'm right about that, right?
That's your story?

1341
01:28:58,957 --> 01:29:00,917
I swear on my mother's soul...

1342
01:29:00,959 --> 01:29:02,585
that's what happened.

1343
01:29:03,587 --> 01:29:06,548
The man you killed
just got released from prison.

1344
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:09,719
He got caught at a company warehouse
full of hot items.

1345
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:12,389
He could've fuckin' walked.

1346
01:29:12,473 --> 01:29:16,644
All he had to do was say my dad's name,
but he didn't; he kept his mouth shut.

1347
01:29:16,728 --> 01:29:19,814
He did his fuckin' time
like a man.

1348
01:29:19,898 --> 01:29:22,150
He did four years for us.

1349
01:29:22,234 --> 01:29:24,653
So, Mr. Orange...

1350
01:29:24,737 --> 01:29:27,740
you're telling me
that this good friend of mine...

1351
01:29:27,783 --> 01:29:30,619
who did four years
for my father...

1352
01:29:30,703 --> 01:29:35,625
who, in four years, never made a deal,
no matter what they offered him...

1353
01:29:35,667 --> 01:29:38,753
you're telling me that
now that he's free...

1354
01:29:38,796 --> 01:29:41,757
and we're making good
on our commitment to him...

1355
01:29:41,799 --> 01:29:46,471
he's just gonna decide,
out of the fucking blue...

1356
01:29:46,555 --> 01:29:48,473
to rip us off?

1357
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:53,521
Why don't you tell me
what really happened.

1358
01:29:53,605 --> 01:29:55,273
What the hell for?

1359
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,318
It'd just be more bullshit.

1360
01:30:00,488 --> 01:30:02,448
This man set us up.

1361
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:06,745
Dad, I'm sorry,
but I don't know what's happening.

1362
01:30:06,829 --> 01:30:10,583
- It's all right. I do.
- What are you talking about?

1363
01:30:10,667 --> 01:30:14,338
That lump of shit's workin'
with the L.A.P.D.

1364
01:30:15,672 --> 01:30:19,009
I don't have the slightest
fucking idea...

1365
01:30:19,093 --> 01:30:20,511
what you're talking about.

1366
01:30:20,595 --> 01:30:24,140
Joe, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.

1367
01:30:24,224 --> 01:30:26,017
Like hell I am.

1368
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:29,188
Trust me on this.
You've made a mistake.

1369
01:30:29,272 --> 01:30:30,982
He's a good kid.

1370
01:30:31,024 --> 01:30:33,610
I understand
you're super-fuckin'-pissed.

1371
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:35,446
We're all real emotional.

1372
01:30:35,529 --> 01:30:39,742
But you're barking up the wrong tree.
I know him. He wouldn't do that.

1373
01:30:39,826 --> 01:30:41,369
You don't know jack shit!

1374
01:30:41,453 --> 01:30:42,621
I do.

1375
01:30:42,704 --> 01:30:44,622
The cocksucker
tipped off the cops...

1376
01:30:44,707 --> 01:30:46,834
and got Mr. Brown
and Mr. Blue killed.

1377
01:30:46,918 --> 01:30:49,879
- Mr. Blue is dead?
- Dead as Dillinger.

1378
01:30:49,963 --> 01:30:51,965
How do you know all this?

1379
01:30:52,049 --> 01:30:55,469
He was the only one
I wasn't 100 percent on.

1380
01:30:55,553 --> 01:30:58,806
I should have my head examined,
going ahead when I wasn't 100 percent.

1381
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:02,644
- That's your proof?
- With instinct, you don't need proof.

1382
01:31:02,728 --> 01:31:05,064
I ignored it before,
but no more.

1383
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:09,736
Have you lost your fuckin' mind?

1384
01:31:09,778 --> 01:31:12,614
I'm not gonna let you make
a terrible mistake.

1385
01:31:12,698 --> 01:31:15,618
Come on, guys.
Nobody wants this.

1386
01:31:15,702 --> 01:31:17,620
We're supposed to be
fuckin' professionals.

1387
01:31:18,497 --> 01:31:20,374
Larry, look...

1388
01:31:20,416 --> 01:31:22,418
it's been quite a long time.

1389
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:23,920
A lot of jobs.

1390
01:31:23,961 --> 01:31:27,006
There's no need for this, man.

1391
01:31:27,090 --> 01:31:29,509
Let's just put our guns down...

1392
01:31:30,678 --> 01:31:32,388
and let's settle this...

1393
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:34,098
with a fucking conversation.

1394
01:31:34,182 --> 01:31:37,644
Joe, if you kill that man,
you die next.

1395
01:31:37,728 --> 01:31:39,897
Repeat: you kill him,
you die next.

1396
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:43,275
Larry, we have been friends.

1397
01:31:43,359 --> 01:31:45,528
You respect my dad
and I respect you...

1398
01:31:45,612 --> 01:31:47,530
but I'll put bullets
in you.

1399
01:31:47,614 --> 01:31:49,866
You put that fuckin' gun
down now.

1400
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:52,954
Goddamn you, Joe...

1401
01:31:53,038 --> 01:31:54,456
don't make me do this.

1402
01:31:54,539 --> 01:31:57,167
Larry, you stop pointin' that gun
at my dad!

1403
01:33:44,002 --> 01:33:45,920
I'm sorry, kid.

1404
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:50,258
Looks like we're gonna...

1405
01:33:51,594 --> 01:33:53,554
do a little time.

1406
01:34:00,063 --> 01:34:01,981
I'm a cop.

1407
01:34:03,775 --> 01:34:05,735
Larry...

1408
01:34:06,987 --> 01:34:08,947
I'm sorry.

1409
01:34:10,116 --> 01:34:11,909
I'm...

1410
01:34:11,952 --> 01:34:14,079
so sorry.

1411
01:34:16,958 --> 01:34:19,419
I'm a cop.

1412
01:34:36,481 --> 01:34:37,941
I'm sorry.

1413
01:34:49,663 --> 01:34:51,123
I'm sorry.

1414
01:34:52,708 --> 01:34:54,376
I'm...

1415
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:55,711
sorr--

1416
01:34:58,465 --> 01:34:59,549
Freeze!

1417
01:34:59,633 --> 01:35:01,635
Drop the fucking gun, buddy!

1418
01:35:01,677 --> 01:35:03,637
- Now!
- Put the gun down!

1419
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:06,515
- Don't do it!
- Drop the gun, man!

1420
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:09,853
- Drop the fucking gun!
- We're gonna blow you away!
