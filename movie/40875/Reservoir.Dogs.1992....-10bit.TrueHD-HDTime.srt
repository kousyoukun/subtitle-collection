00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,052
Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin" is about.

2
00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:12,389
It's all about a girl
who digs a guy with a big dick.

3
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:14,642
The entire song
is a metaphor for big dicks.

4
00:00:14,726 --> 00:00:16,144
No, it ain't.

5
00:00:16,227 --> 00:00:19,397
It's about a girl
who's very vulnerable.

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,734
She's been fucked over a few times
and she meets a guy who's sensitive.

7
00:00:22,818 --> 00:00:26,071
Whoa. Timeout.
Tell that bullshit to the tourists.

8
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:28,366
Toby? Who the fuck is Toby?

9
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:33,038
"Like A Virgin" is not about some
sensitive girl who meets a nice fella.

10
00:00:33,122 --> 00:00:35,750
That's what "True Blue" is about.
No argument about that.

11
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:39,671
- Which one is "True Blue"?
- It was a big-ass hit for Madonna.

12
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:43,175
I don't even follow that top-of-the-pops
shit, and I've heard of "True Blue."

13
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:46,053
I didn't say I ain't heard of it.
All I asked is, how's it go?

14
00:00:46,138 --> 00:00:48,557
Excuse me for not being
the world's biggest Madonna fan.

15
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:51,060
Personally, I can do without her.

16
00:00:51,144 --> 00:00:53,229
I used to like her early stuff,
"Borderline"...

17
00:00:53,313 --> 00:00:56,233
but once she got off with that
"Papa, Don't Preach" phase, I tuned out.

18
00:00:56,316 --> 00:00:59,152
Hey, you guys are making me
lose my train of thought here.

19
00:00:59,236 --> 00:01:01,363
I was sayin' something.
What was it?

20
00:01:01,447 --> 00:01:04,742
Oh, Toby's that
little Chinese girl.

21
00:01:04,826 --> 00:01:07,454
- What was her last name?
- What's that?

22
00:01:07,538 --> 00:01:12,001
It's an old address book I found in
a coat I haven't worn in a coon's age.

23
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:15,171
- What was that name?
- What the fuck was I talkin' about?

24
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:17,465
You said "True Blue"
was about a guy--

25
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:19,802
a sensitive girl
who meets a nice guy...

26
00:01:19,886 --> 00:01:22,472
but "Like A Virgin"
was a metaphor for big dicks.

27
00:01:22,514 --> 00:01:24,808
Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin" is about.

28
00:01:24,892 --> 00:01:27,812
It's all about this cooze
who's a regular fuck machine.

29
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,273
I'm talkin' morning, day,
night, afternoon...

30
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,193
dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick!

31
00:01:33,235 --> 00:01:35,445
- How many "dicks" is that?
- A lot.

32
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:38,824
Then one day, she meets
this John Holmes motherfucker.

33
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:42,496
It's like, "Whoa, baby." He's like
Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape."

34
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:46,083
He's diggin' tunnels.
Now she's gettin' serious dick action.

35
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:50,630
She's feelin' somethin' she ain't
felt since forever: pain, pain.

36
00:01:50,714 --> 00:01:52,340
Chew? Toby Chew?

37
00:01:52,383 --> 00:01:54,677
It hurts. It hurts her.

38
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,221
It shouldn't hurt her.
Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now.

39
00:01:57,263 --> 00:01:59,932
But when this cat
fucks her, it hurts.

40
00:02:00,017 --> 00:02:03,145
It hurts just like it did
the first time.

41
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:05,857
You see, the pain
is reminding a fuck machine...

42
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,025
what it was once like
to be a virgin.

43
00:02:08,109 --> 00:02:10,945
Hence, "Like A Virgin."

44
00:02:12,114 --> 00:02:13,615
Wong.

45
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:17,870
-Give me that fuckin' thing.
-What in hell do you think you're doin'?

46
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:21,040
I'm sick of hearin' it, Joe.
I'll give it back to you when we leave.

47
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,627
What do you mean, when we leave?
Give me it back now!

48
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:27,674
For the past 15 minutes now,
you've been droning on about names.

49
00:02:27,758 --> 00:02:30,594
"Toby. Toby?

50
00:02:30,636 --> 00:02:32,930
Toby? Toby Wong.

51
00:02:33,014 --> 00:02:35,183
Toby Wong? Toby Wong.

52
00:02:35,267 --> 00:02:38,187
Toby Chung fuckin' Charlie Chan."

53
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,731
I've got Madonna's big dick
comin' out of my left ear...

54
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:44,736
and Toby the Jap-- I don't know what--
comin' out of my right.

55
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:47,322
Give me that book.

56
00:02:47,406 --> 00:02:49,324
Are you gonna put it away?

57
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:52,953
I'm gonna do whatever
the fuck I want with it.

58
00:02:53,038 --> 00:02:55,457
Well, then I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to keep it.

59
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,461
Hey, Joe,
want me to shoot this guy?

60
00:02:58,502 --> 00:02:59,461
Shit.

61
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:03,592
You shoot me in a dream,
you better wake up and apologize.

62
00:03:07,471 --> 00:03:10,683
You guys been listenin' to K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s" weekend?

63
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:12,602
Yeah. That's fuckin' great.

64
00:03:12,644 --> 00:03:15,522
- You believe the songs they're playin'?
- Know what I heard the other day?

65
00:03:15,606 --> 00:03:18,526
"Heartbeat, It's a Lovebeat" by little
Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco family.

66
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:21,153
I haven't heard that song since
I was in the fifth fuckin' grade.

67
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:24,867
When I was comin' down here, "The Night
the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on.

68
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,828
I ain't heard that song
since it was big.

69
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:31,124
But when it was big, I must've heard it
a million-trillion fuckin' times.

70
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,168
But this is the first time
I ever realized...

71
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:36,005
that the girl singin' the song
is the one who shot Andy.

72
00:03:36,088 --> 00:03:38,674
You didn't know that Vickie Lawrence
was the one who shot Andy?

73
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:42,679
- I thought the cheatin' wife shot Andy.
- They say that at the end of the song.

74
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:46,183
I know, motherfucker. I just heard it.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

75
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,647
I must've zoned out
during that part before.

76
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:50,772
All right,
I'll take care of the check.

77
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:54,484
All right,
I'll take care of the check.

78
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:56,904
You guys can get the tip.

79
00:03:56,988 --> 00:03:59,365
Should be about a buck apiece.

80
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:02,661
And you, when I come back
I want my book.

81
00:04:02,703 --> 00:04:05,122
Sorry. It's my book now.

82
00:04:05,206 --> 00:04:09,252
Hey, I changed my mind.
Shoot this piece of shit, will ya?

83
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:16,343
All right, everybody cough up
some green for the little lady.

84
00:04:22,226 --> 00:04:24,436
Come on, throw in a buck.

85
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:26,189
I don't tip.

86
00:04:26,273 --> 00:04:28,942
- You don't tip?
- I don't believe in it.

87
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:31,195
You don't believe in tipping?

88
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,491
Do you know what these chicks make?
They make shit.

89
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,243
If she don't make enough money,
she can quit.

90
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:41,040
I don't even know a fuckin' Jew
who'd have the balls to say that.

91
00:04:41,124 --> 00:04:43,877
Let me get this straight.
You don't ever tip, huh?

92
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,671
I don't tip because
society says I have to.

93
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:51,135
If they really put forth the effort,
I'll give 'em somethin' extra.

94
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:53,805
But this tipping automatically,
it's for the birds.

95
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,559
As far as I'm concerned,
they're just doin' their job.

96
00:04:57,643 --> 00:04:59,520
- This girl was nice.
- She was okay.

97
00:04:59,604 --> 00:05:01,898
- She wasn't anything special.
- What's special?

98
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:04,568
Take you in the back
and suck your dick?

99
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:10,199
I'd go over 12% for that.

100
00:05:10,283 --> 00:05:14,120
I ordered coffee, all right?
She's only filled my cup three times.

101
00:05:14,204 --> 00:05:16,206
I want it filled six times.

102
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,502
Six times? Well, what if
she's too fuckin' busy?

103
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:22,714
The words "too fuckin' busy"
shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.

104
00:05:22,798 --> 00:05:25,426
Excuse me, Mr. Pink,
but the last fuckin' thing you need's...

105
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:26,927
another cup of coffee.

106
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:31,390
These ladies aren't starvin' to death.
They make minimum wage.

107
00:05:31,475 --> 00:05:33,560
I used to work minimum wage,
and when I did...

108
00:05:33,644 --> 00:05:36,522
I wasn't lucky enough to have a job
that society deemed tip-worthy.

109
00:05:36,606 --> 00:05:38,691
You don't care they're
countin' on your tips to live?

110
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:43,155
You know what this is?

111
00:05:43,197 --> 00:05:45,950
The world's smallest violin,
playin' just for the waitresses.

112
00:05:46,034 --> 00:05:49,454
You don't have any idea
what you're talkin' about.

113
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:52,874
These people bust their ass.
This is a hard job.

114
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:56,295
So's working at McDonald's,
but you don't feel the need to tip them.

115
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:58,923
They're servin' you food,
but society says...

116
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:02,761
"Don't tip these guys over here,
but tip these guys." That's bullshit.

117
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:05,014
Waitressing is
the number-one occupation...

118
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,767
for female non-college graduates
in this country.

119
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:11,814
It's the one job basically
any woman can get and make a living on.

120
00:06:11,897 --> 00:06:13,857
The reason is
because of their tips.

121
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:16,569
Fuck all that.

122
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:22,034
I'm very sorry the government
taxes their tips.

123
00:06:22,118 --> 00:06:24,370
That's fucked up.
That ain't my fault.

124
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:26,539
It would appear that waitresses
are one of the many groups...

125
00:06:26,623 --> 00:06:28,875
the government fucks in the ass
on a regular basis.

126
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,504
Show me a paper that says the government
shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.

127
00:06:32,547 --> 00:06:35,216
I'll vote for it.
But what I won't do is play ball.

128
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,179
This non-college bullshit, I got two
words for that: Learn to fuckin' type.

129
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:42,641
If you're expectin' me to help out with
the rent, you're in for a big surprise.

130
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:44,644
He's convinced me.
Give me my dollar back.

131
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:48,065
Hey. Leave the dollars there.

132
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:52,695
All right, ramblers,
let's get ramblin'.

133
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,490
Wait a minute.
Who didn't throw in?

134
00:06:55,574 --> 00:06:58,285
- Mr. Pink.
- Mr. Pink?

135
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:00,997
- Why not?
- He don't tip.

136
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:02,999
He don't tip?

137
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,001
- You don't tip?
- He don't believe in it.

138
00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:08,380
Shut up. What do you mean,
you don't believe in it?

139
00:07:08,464 --> 00:07:13,136
Cough up a buck, you cheap bastard.
I paid for your goddamn breakfast.

140
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,099
Since you bought breakfast, I'll put in.
But normally I would never do this.

141
00:07:19,227 --> 00:07:21,479
Never mind what you
normally would do.

142
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:26,026
Just cough in your goddamn buck
like everybody else. Thank you.

143
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:32,242
That was the Partridge Family's
"Doesn't Somebody Want To Be Wanted?"...

144
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,411
followed by Edison Lighthouse's...

145
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:37,623
"Love Grows Where
My Rosemary Goes"...

146
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,336
as K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s" weekend...

147
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,964
just keeps on truckin'.

148
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:44,465
just keeps on truckin'.

149
00:09:27,754 --> 00:09:29,506
I'm gonna die.

150
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:32,509
I'm gonna die!

151
00:09:32,593 --> 00:09:35,471
Just hold on, buddy boy!

152
00:09:35,555 --> 00:09:37,223
I'm gonna die!

153
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:42,604
- I'm sorry!
- Give me your hand.

154
00:09:42,646 --> 00:09:46,942
I can't believe she killed me, man!
Who'd have fuckin' thought that?

155
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:51,574
Hey, just cancel
that shit right now!

156
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:55,536
You're hurt. You're hurt
real fuckin' bad, but you ain't dying!

157
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:04,964
All this blood's scarin'
the shit out of me, Larry!

158
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:07,467
I'm gonna die!
I know it!

159
00:10:07,551 --> 00:10:10,596
Excuse me, I didn't realize
you had a degree in medicine.

160
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:14,809
Are you a doctor?

161
00:10:14,893 --> 00:10:16,770
Are you a doctor?

162
00:10:16,812 --> 00:10:19,273
Answer me, please!
Are you a doctor?

163
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:24,028
No, I'm not.
I'm not.

164
00:10:24,112 --> 00:10:27,157
So you admit you don't know
what you're talkin' about.

165
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:31,788
If you're through givin' me your
amateur opinion, lie back and listen.

166
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:35,291
I'm takin' you back to the rendezvous,
Joe's gonna get you a doctor...

167
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:39,088
the doctor's gonna
fix you up and...

168
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,424
you're gonna be okay.

169
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,886
Now say it!
You're gonna be okay!

170
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,388
Say it!

171
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:49,308
You're gonna be okay!

172
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,478
Say the goddamn words!
You're gonna be okay!

173
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:54,022
Oh, God!

174
00:10:54,064 --> 00:10:56,149
Say the goddamn fuckin' words!

175
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:57,818
Say it!

176
00:10:57,902 --> 00:11:00,071
Okay, Larry.

177
00:11:00,155 --> 00:11:03,033
Correct! Correct!

178
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:07,705
I'm okay.

179
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,009
Look where we are.

180
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:20,762
Look where we are.

181
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,642
She had a baby, man.
She had a baby!

182
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,643
We're in a warehouse.

183
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:31,024
Who's a tough guy?
Who's a tough guy?

184
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,945
Come on, who's a tough guy?

185
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,865
Who's a tough guy?
You're a tough guy.

186
00:11:37,908 --> 00:11:39,868
You're a fuckin' tough guy.

187
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:48,044
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.

188
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:50,463
We made it. We made it.

189
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:53,843
We fuckin' made it.
We have fuckin' made it.

190
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:58,932
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.

191
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:02,352
Look where we are.

192
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,148
Hold on. Hold on.

193
00:12:07,442 --> 00:12:09,944
- Shit!
- Stop bangin' your head.

194
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,448
You're gonna bang
a fuckin' hole in the floor.

195
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:16,285
You don't wanna hurt
the fuckin' floor, do you?

196
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:19,539
I can't do anything for you.

197
00:12:19,624 --> 00:12:22,085
But when Joe gets here...

198
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:24,128
which should be any time now...

199
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:27,340
he's gonna help you out,
he's gonna take care of you.

200
00:12:27,424 --> 00:12:29,843
We're gonna sit
and wait for Joe.

201
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:35,350
- Who are we waitin' for?
- Joe.

202
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:43,860
Larry, I'm fucking scared, man.

203
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:49,659
Would you please hold me?

204
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:51,494
Yeah, sure.

205
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:20,112
You go ahead and be scared.

206
00:13:20,195 --> 00:13:22,614
You've been brave enough
for one day.

207
00:13:26,661 --> 00:13:29,998
I just want you
to relax now, okay?

208
00:13:30,082 --> 00:13:32,418
You're not gonna fuckin' die.
You're gonna be fine.

209
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:35,963
When Joe gets here,
he'll make you 100% again.

210
00:13:37,507 --> 00:13:40,176
Am I hurt?
I'm hurt bad, Larry.

211
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:44,265
It's not good, no.

212
00:13:44,349 --> 00:13:45,767
Hey, Larry...

213
00:13:46,977 --> 00:13:49,897
bless your heart
for what you're tryin' to do.

214
00:13:51,148 --> 00:13:53,859
I was panicking
for a minute back there.

215
00:13:54,903 --> 00:13:58,031
But I got my senses back now.

216
00:13:58,115 --> 00:14:01,201
The situation is,
I'm shot in the belly.

217
00:14:01,244 --> 00:14:04,414
Without medical attention,
I'm gonna die.

218
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:11,505
- I can't take you to a hospital.
- Fuck jail, man!

219
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:16,177
You don't have to take me in.
Just drive me up to the front, man.

220
00:14:16,261 --> 00:14:19,973
Just drop me on the sidewalk.
I'll take care of myself.

221
00:14:22,435 --> 00:14:26,731
I won't tell 'em anything, man.
I won't tell 'em anything.

222
00:14:26,774 --> 00:14:29,485
I swear to fucking God, man.

223
00:14:31,112 --> 00:14:34,741
Just look in my eyes, Larry.
Look in my eyes.

224
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:40,540
I won't tell them anything.

225
00:14:40,623 --> 00:14:42,583
You'll be safe, man.

226
00:14:44,044 --> 00:14:48,007
You're not gonna fuckin' die, kid.
All right?

227
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:51,219
Listen to me.
You're gonna be fine.

228
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:54,640
Along with the kneecap...

229
00:14:54,723 --> 00:14:57,267
the gut is the most painful area
a guy can get shot in.

230
00:14:57,352 --> 00:14:58,520
No shit!

231
00:14:58,603 --> 00:15:01,356
But it takes a long time
to die from it.

232
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,859
I'm talkin' days.

233
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:08,114
You're gonna wish you were dead, but
it takes days to die from your wound.

234
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:09,949
Time is on your side.

235
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:12,285
Was that a fucking setup, or what?

236
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,873
Shit. Orange got tagged?

237
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,710
Gut shot.

238
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:21,046
Fuck. Where's Brown?

239
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,464
Dead.

240
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:26,010
How did he die?

241
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:29,305
How the fuck do you think?
The cops shot him.

242
00:15:30,182 --> 00:15:31,475
This is bad.

243
00:15:31,517 --> 00:15:35,271
This is so fucking bad.
Is it bad?

244
00:15:35,355 --> 00:15:37,023
As opposed to good?

245
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:40,318
Man, this is fucked up.

246
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:42,654
This is so fucked up.

247
00:15:42,738 --> 00:15:45,699
Somebody fucked us up
big time, man.

248
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:52,333
- You really think we were set up?
- Do you even doubt it, man?

249
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:56,880
I don't think we got set up, I know it.
Where did all those cops come from, huh?

250
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,383
One minute they're not there,
and the next minute they're there.

251
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,720
I didn't hear any sirens.
The alarm went off, okay?

252
00:16:02,804 --> 00:16:05,306
When an alarm goes, you got
a four-minute response time.

253
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,018
Unless a patrol car is cruising
that street at that moment...

254
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,646
you got four minutes before
they can realistically respond.

255
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,691
In one minute, there were
17 blue boys out there...

256
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:17,153
all knowing exactly what the fuck they
were doing, and they were all there!

257
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:21,117
Remember that second wave
that showed up in the cars?

258
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:23,829
Those were the ones responding to the
alarm, but those first motherfuckers...

259
00:16:23,912 --> 00:16:26,331
they were there
and they were waitin' for us.

260
00:16:26,415 --> 00:16:28,917
Haven't you fuckin'
thought about this?

261
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:31,712
I haven't had a chance to think.

262
00:16:31,755 --> 00:16:35,050
First I was just tryin'
to get the fuck outta there.

263
00:16:35,134 --> 00:16:38,220
And after we got away,
I've just been dealin' with him.

264
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:40,640
Better start thinkin' about it,
'cause that's all I'm thinkin' about.

265
00:16:40,724 --> 00:16:43,560
I wasn't even gonna come here.
I was just gonna drive off, man...

266
00:16:43,644 --> 00:16:46,230
because whoever set us up
knows about this place.

267
00:16:46,314 --> 00:16:50,068
There could've been cops here waitin'!
There could be cops comin' right now!

268
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:57,076
Let's go in the other room.
Hey. In there.

269
00:16:57,118 --> 00:16:59,704
Larry, don't leave me.

270
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:07,713
I'll be right in the other room, okay?
I'll be right there lookin' at ya.

271
00:17:07,797 --> 00:17:10,383
I'm right here
lookin' at you, okay?

272
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:14,972
I'm right over there.

273
00:17:17,225 --> 00:17:19,102
Larry...

274
00:17:19,144 --> 00:17:21,438
I'm gonna fucking die.

275
00:17:21,522 --> 00:17:23,274
Larry.

276
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:27,737
What the fuck
am I doin' here, man?

277
00:17:27,821 --> 00:17:29,906
I felt funny about
this job right off.

278
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,702
As soon as I felt it I should have said,
"No, thank you," but I never listen.

279
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,080
Every time I ever got fucked
buying weed, the same thing.

280
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:38,833
I didn't trust the guy,
but I wanted to believe him.

281
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:41,795
If he's not lying and it really
is Thai stick, then it's great.

282
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:45,257
But it never is, and I always said that
if I felt that about a job, I'd walk.

283
00:17:45,342 --> 00:17:48,470
And I didn't. I didn't
because of the fuckin' money!

284
00:17:48,554 --> 00:17:51,348
What's done is done.
I need you cool.

285
00:17:52,433 --> 00:17:54,351
Are you cool?

286
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,105
I'm cool.

287
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:01,151
Splash some water on your face.

288
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:06,783
Take a breather.

289
00:18:21,176 --> 00:18:24,346
Relax. Have a cigarette.

290
00:18:24,388 --> 00:18:26,390
I quit.

291
00:18:26,432 --> 00:18:29,185
- All right.
- Why, you got one?

292
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:05,602
Okay, let's go through
what happened.

293
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:08,231
We're in the place,
everything's going fine.

294
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,442
Then the alarm gets tripped.

295
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:14,905
I turn around
and all these cops are outside.

296
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:20,370
You're right. It was like, bam,
I blinked my eyes and they're there.

297
00:19:20,454 --> 00:19:24,834
Everybody starts going ape-shit.
Then Mr. Blonde starts to shoot all--

298
00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:27,879
- That's not correct.
- What's wrong with it?

299
00:19:27,963 --> 00:19:31,675
Okay. The cops did not show up
after the alarm went off.

300
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,346
The cops didn't show up until after
Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.

301
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,558
- Soon as I heard the alarm, I saw cops.
- It wasn't that soon.

302
00:19:38,642 --> 00:19:42,479
They didn't let their presence be known
until after Mr. Blonde became a madman.

303
00:19:42,563 --> 00:19:45,483
I'm not sayin' they weren't there.
I'm sayin' they were there.

304
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:49,446
But they didn't make a move until after
Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.

305
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,491
I mean, that's how
I know we were set up.

306
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:55,912
- Mr. White, you can see that--
- Enough of this "Mr. White" shit.

307
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:59,667
Wait! Don't tell me you're fuckin' name!
I don't wanna know it!

308
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,336
Jesus Christ,
I ain't gonna tell you mine.

309
00:20:07,676 --> 00:20:09,970
You're right.
This is bad.

310
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:18,814
- How did you get out?
- I shot my way out.

311
00:20:18,898 --> 00:20:21,359
Everybody started shootin',
so I blasted my way out of there.

312
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:29,410
Move it! Get outta the way!
Get the fuck outta the way!

313
00:20:31,371 --> 00:20:33,039
Get the fuck outta the way!

314
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,377
Move it!
Get outta the way!

315
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:45,136
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck is your problem, man?

316
00:20:45,221 --> 00:20:48,474
- You fuckin' asshole!
- Fuck you!

317
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:49,517
Move!

318
00:20:56,943 --> 00:20:58,152
Jesus!

319
00:20:58,236 --> 00:21:00,655
Get outta the car!
Get the fuck outta the car!

320
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:02,908
Move it!
Move outta the way!

321
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:34,528
I tagged a couple of cops.

322
00:21:34,612 --> 00:21:36,697
Did you kill anybody?

323
00:21:36,782 --> 00:21:39,910
- A few cops.
- No real people?

324
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:41,954
Just cops.

325
00:21:53,301 --> 00:21:55,345
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

326
00:21:56,805 --> 00:21:59,808
That was the most insane
fuckin' thing I have ever seen.

327
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,562
Why the fuck would Joe
hire a guy like that?

328
00:22:02,646 --> 00:22:04,231
I don't want to kill anybody.

329
00:22:04,314 --> 00:22:06,942
If I gotta get out that door
and you're standin' in my way...

330
00:22:06,984 --> 00:22:09,445
one way or the other
you're gettin' outta my way.

331
00:22:09,487 --> 00:22:11,864
That's the way I look at it.

332
00:22:11,948 --> 00:22:14,534
The choice between
doin' ten years...

333
00:22:14,618 --> 00:22:17,412
and takin' out
some stupid motherfucker...

334
00:22:18,414 --> 00:22:20,541
ain't no choice at all.

335
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:23,294
But I ain't no madman, either.

336
00:22:23,378 --> 00:22:27,007
What the fuck was Joe thinkin'?
You can't work with a guy like that.

337
00:22:29,552 --> 00:22:32,930
We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't
tag us when he shot the place up.

338
00:22:33,015 --> 00:22:36,978
I came this close
to takin' his ass out myself.

339
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:40,106
I mean, everybody panics.
Everybody.

340
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,818
Things get tense.
It's human nature.

341
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:46,655
You panic. I don't care what
your name is, you can't help it.

342
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:50,577
Fuck, man, you panic on the inside,
in your head, you know?

343
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:54,832
You give yourself a couple of seconds,
get ahold of it and deal with it.

344
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:58,002
What you don't do is start shootin' up
the place and start killin' people.

345
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:02,257
What you're supposed to do
is act like a fuckin' professional.

346
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:06,888
A psychopath ain't a professional.
You can't work with a psychopath.

347
00:23:06,972 --> 00:23:09,558
You don't know what those
sick assholes are gonna do next.

348
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,857
I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you
think that black girl was? Twenty?

349
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:18,235
- Maybe 21?
- If that.

350
00:23:20,237 --> 00:23:22,865
Did you see what happened
to anybody else?

351
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,621
Me and Orange jumped in the car,
Brown floored it.

352
00:23:27,704 --> 00:23:29,873
After that,
I don't know what went down.

353
00:23:29,957 --> 00:23:31,917
It was every man for himself.

354
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:34,920
As far as Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue are
concerned, I ain't got the foggiest...

355
00:23:34,963 --> 00:23:37,215
'cause once I got out,
I never looked back.

356
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:39,301
What do you think?

357
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:42,638
What do I think? The cops either
caught 'em or killed 'em.

358
00:23:44,432 --> 00:23:47,101
No chance they punched through?
You found a hole.

359
00:23:47,186 --> 00:23:49,522
Yeah, and that was
a fuckin' miracle.

360
00:23:49,605 --> 00:23:53,359
But even if they did get away,
then where the fuck are they?

361
00:23:53,443 --> 00:23:56,780
You don't think it's possible one of 'em
got ahold of the diamonds and--

362
00:23:56,864 --> 00:24:00,242
- No, no way.
- How can you be so sure?

363
00:24:01,703 --> 00:24:04,205
I got the diamonds.

364
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,134
That's my boy.

365
00:24:14,218 --> 00:24:16,929
- Where?
- I stashed 'em.

366
00:24:17,013 --> 00:24:21,226
If you wanna come with me,
let's go get 'em right now, this second.

367
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:24,896
'Cause I think stayin' here, man, we
should have our fuckin' heads examined.

368
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,065
That was the plan.
We meet here.

369
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,068
Then where the fuck is everybody?

370
00:24:29,152 --> 00:24:32,238
I say the plan becomes null and void
once we found out we got a rat here.

371
00:24:32,322 --> 00:24:35,408
We ain't got the slightest idea
what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue.

372
00:24:35,493 --> 00:24:37,829
They could both be dead
or maybe they're arrested.

373
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:40,832
The cops could have 'em right now
at the station, sweatin' 'em down.

374
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:44,503
They don't know our names, but they
could be singin' about this place.

375
00:24:52,471 --> 00:24:56,225
I swear to God,
I think I'm fuckin' jinxed.

376
00:24:56,309 --> 00:24:58,227
What?

377
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,066
Two jobs back,
it was a four-man job.

378
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,569
We discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop.

379
00:25:07,531 --> 00:25:09,157
No shit?

380
00:25:10,326 --> 00:25:12,828
Thank God we discovered in time.

381
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:15,998
We had to forget the whole thing,
just walk the fuck away from it.

382
00:25:17,042 --> 00:25:19,252
So who's the rat this time?

383
00:25:19,336 --> 00:25:21,296
Mr. Blue?

384
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,132
Mr. Brown?

385
00:25:23,216 --> 00:25:27,345
Joe? Joe set this whole thing up.
Maybe he set it up to set it up.

386
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:30,933
I don't buy it.
Me and Joe go back a long time.

387
00:25:31,017 --> 00:25:34,312
I can tell you definitely, Joe didn't
know a thing about this bullshit.

388
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:39,026
I know Joe, and me sayin' he definitely
had nothin' to do with it is ridiculous.

389
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:42,196
I can say I definitely didn't do it,
'cause I know what I did or didn't do.

390
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,742
But I cannot definitely say that about
anybody, 'cause I don't definitely know.

391
00:25:45,784 --> 00:25:47,911
For all I know, you're the rat.

392
00:25:47,995 --> 00:25:50,372
For all I know,
you're the fuckin' rat!

393
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:52,792
All right, now you're usin'
your fuckin' head.

394
00:25:52,876 --> 00:25:55,337
For all we know, he's the rat.

395
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:58,674
That kid in there is dying
from a fuckin' bullet I saw him take...

396
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:00,885
so don't you be calling him a rat!

397
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:03,304
Look, I'm right, okay?

398
00:26:03,388 --> 00:26:05,849
Somebody's a fuckin' rat.

399
00:26:10,605 --> 00:26:13,233
Where's the commode in this dungeon?
I gotta take a squirt.

400
00:26:16,153 --> 00:26:18,989
Go down the hall, make a left,
go up the stairs...

401
00:26:19,074 --> 00:26:20,992
and make a right.

402
00:26:28,626 --> 00:26:32,422
- By the way, how's Alabama?
- Alabama?

403
00:26:32,464 --> 00:26:36,093
I haven't seen Bama
in over a year and a half.

404
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,638
But I thought you two
were a team.

405
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,641
We were for a little while.

406
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:45,355
Did about four jobs together,
then decided to call it quits.

407
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:46,981
Why?

408
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:53,906
You push that woman-man thing too long
and it gets to you after a while.

409
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,117
What's she doin' now?

410
00:26:56,201 --> 00:26:59,705
She hooked up with Frank McGar.
They've done a couple jobs together.

411
00:26:59,788 --> 00:27:01,957
Hell of a woman.
Good little thief.

412
00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:09,300
- So explain the telegram.
- Five-man job.

413
00:27:09,383 --> 00:27:11,635
Bustin' in and bustin' out
of a diamond wholesaler's.

414
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:14,680
Can you move the ice afterwards?
I don't know nobody that can move ice.

415
00:27:14,764 --> 00:27:16,974
No problem.
We got guys waitin' for it.

416
00:27:17,017 --> 00:27:20,354
What happened to Marcellus Spivey?
Didn't he always move your ice?

417
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,899
He's doin' 20 years in Susanville.

418
00:27:22,982 --> 00:27:26,235
Twenty years? Holy God.
What for?

419
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,738
Bad luck.

420
00:27:27,821 --> 00:27:29,656
I guess you can say that again.

421
00:27:30,575 --> 00:27:32,493
What's the exposure like?

422
00:27:32,577 --> 00:27:35,497
Two minutes, tops.
But it's a tough two minutes.

423
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:39,001
Daylight, during business hours,
dealing with a crowd.

424
00:27:39,085 --> 00:27:41,504
But you'll have the guys
to deal with the crowd.

425
00:27:41,588 --> 00:27:44,466
- How many employees?
- I'd say around 20.

426
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:46,301
Security pretty lax.

427
00:27:46,385 --> 00:27:48,762
They most usually
just deal in boxes.

428
00:27:48,846 --> 00:27:51,849
You know, uncut stones
from the diamond syndicate.

429
00:27:51,933 --> 00:27:56,605
But on this day, they're getting a
shipment of polished stones from lsrael.

430
00:27:56,689 --> 00:27:58,941
They're like a way station,
you know?

431
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:02,362
-They get picked up and sent to Vermont.
-No, they're not.

432
00:28:05,866 --> 00:28:07,826
What's the cut, poppa?

433
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,539
Juicy, junior.
Real juicy.

434
00:28:14,168 --> 00:28:16,796
Look, man, you do what you want.

435
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:19,673
I'm outta here, man. I'm gonna
check into a motel for a few days.

436
00:28:19,758 --> 00:28:22,761
You know, I'll lay low
and I'll call Joe--

437
00:28:22,845 --> 00:28:25,431
Shit. Did he fuckin' die on us?

438
00:28:26,975 --> 00:28:29,728
Huh? ls he dead or what?

439
00:28:31,188 --> 00:28:34,149
- He ain't dead.
- What is it?

440
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:36,902
I think he's just passed out.

441
00:28:36,945 --> 00:28:41,074
He scared the fuckin' shit outta me.
I thought he was dead for sure.

442
00:28:41,116 --> 00:28:43,952
Without medical attention,
he will die for sure.

443
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:47,999
What are we gonna do, man?
We can't take him to the hospital.

444
00:28:49,585 --> 00:28:53,548
Without medical attention,
he might not live through the night.

445
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:56,384
The bullet in his belly
is my fault.

446
00:28:56,468 --> 00:29:00,264
While that might not mean jack shit
to you, it means a hell of a lot to me.

447
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:04,143
First things first, okay?
Stayin' here's goofy. We gotta book up.

448
00:29:04,227 --> 00:29:06,855
So what do you suggest we do?
Go to a hotel?

449
00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:11,109
We got a guy who's shot in the belly,
who can't walk, bleeds like a stuck pig.

450
00:29:11,152 --> 00:29:13,529
And when he's awake,
he screams in pain.

451
00:29:14,614 --> 00:29:16,616
You got an idea, spit it out.

452
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,493
Joe could help.

453
00:29:18,577 --> 00:29:23,332
If we could get in touch with Joe,
Joe could get him to a doctor.

454
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:26,419
Joe could get a doctor
to come to see him.

455
00:29:26,503 --> 00:29:30,591
Assuming we can trust Joe,
how we gonna get in touch with him?

456
00:29:30,675 --> 00:29:34,638
He's supposed to be here, but he ain't,
which makes me nervous about bein' here.

457
00:29:34,721 --> 00:29:38,475
Even if he is on the up and up, I don't
think he's gonna be too happy with us.

458
00:29:38,517 --> 00:29:41,145
He planned a robbery and
he's got a bloodbath on his hands now.

459
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:44,566
He's got dead cops, dead robbers,
dead civilians.

460
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,361
I tend to doubt he's gonna have
a lot of sympathy for our plight.

461
00:29:47,445 --> 00:29:52,158
If I was him, I'd put as much distance
between me and this mess as possible.

462
00:29:55,871 --> 00:29:58,665
Before you got here,
Mr. Orange...

463
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:02,504
was askin' me to take him
to a doctor, to a hospital.

464
00:30:04,381 --> 00:30:07,593
I don't like the idea of
turnin' him over to the cops...

465
00:30:07,677 --> 00:30:10,388
but if we don't,
he's gonna die.

466
00:30:10,472 --> 00:30:13,308
He begged me to do it.

467
00:30:13,392 --> 00:30:17,313
Well, all right.
Then I guess we take him to a hospital.

468
00:30:17,397 --> 00:30:19,566
If that's what he said,
let's do it.

469
00:30:19,649 --> 00:30:22,318
Since he don't know nothin' about us,
I say it's his decision.

470
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,029
He knows a little about me.

471
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,453
What? Wait, wait.
You didn't tell him your name, did you?

472
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,623
I told him my first name
and where I was from.

473
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:35,126
Why?

474
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:39,297
I told him where I was from
a few days ago.

475
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:42,092
It was just
a natural conversation.

476
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:45,179
What was tellin' him your name
when you weren't supposed to?

477
00:30:45,263 --> 00:30:46,806
He asked.

478
00:30:48,308 --> 00:30:51,895
We had just gotten away from the cops.
He just got shot.

479
00:30:51,938 --> 00:30:55,400
It was my fault he got shot.

480
00:30:55,483 --> 00:30:57,902
He's a fuckin' bloody mess.

481
00:30:57,986 --> 00:31:00,405
He's screamin'.

482
00:31:00,448 --> 00:31:03,660
I swear to God, I thought he was
gonna die right then and there.

483
00:31:03,743 --> 00:31:07,664
I'm tryin' to comfort him,
telling him not to worry...

484
00:31:07,748 --> 00:31:11,335
everything's going to be okay,
I'm gonna take care of him.

485
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:13,755
And he asked me
what my name was.

486
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:20,095
I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms.
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

487
00:31:21,598 --> 00:31:26,395
Tell him I'm sorry? I can't
give out that fuckin' information?

488
00:31:26,478 --> 00:31:29,481
It's against the rules?

489
00:31:29,565 --> 00:31:32,485
I don't trust you enough?

490
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:35,781
Maybe I should've,
but I couldn't.

491
00:31:35,864 --> 00:31:38,325
Fuck you! Fuck Joe!

492
00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:41,621
- I'm sure it was a beautiful scene.
- Don't fuckin' patronize me!

493
00:31:41,705 --> 00:31:44,166
I have one question. Do they have
a sheet on you where you're from?

494
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:46,502
- Yeah!
- That's that, then.

495
00:31:46,585 --> 00:31:49,463
I mean, I was worried about
mug shot possibility as it was.

496
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:53,844
He knows A, your name, B, your face,
C, your hometown and D, your specialty.

497
00:31:53,927 --> 00:31:57,180
They're not gonna have to show him a lot
of pictures for him to pick you out!

498
00:31:57,265 --> 00:32:00,852
You didn't tell him anything else
so they could narrow down the selection?

499
00:32:00,936 --> 00:32:04,523
If I have to tell you again to back off,
we're gonna go 'round and 'round.

500
00:32:04,607 --> 00:32:07,527
We ain't takin' him to a hospital.

501
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,278
If we don't, he's gonna die.

502
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:12,448
And I'm very sad about that, but
some fellas are lucky and some ain't.

503
00:32:12,533 --> 00:32:15,161
What the fuck are you
touchin' me for, man?

504
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:22,627
I'll show you
who you're fuckin' with!

505
00:32:22,711 --> 00:32:24,838
You wanna shoot me,
you piece of shit?

506
00:32:24,922 --> 00:32:28,008
I didn't create this situation,
I'm dealin' with it!

507
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:31,847
You're actin' like a first-year thief!
I'm actin' like a professional!

508
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:34,725
If they get him, they could get you,
they could get closer to me...

509
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:36,769
and that can't happen!

510
00:32:36,853 --> 00:32:39,564
You're lookin' at me like it's my fault?
I didn't tell him my name!

511
00:32:39,648 --> 00:32:42,150
I didn't tell him
where I was from!

512
00:32:42,234 --> 00:32:44,862
Shit! Fifteen minutes ago
you almost told me your name!

513
00:32:44,904 --> 00:32:47,114
You're gonna get stuck
in a situation you created!

514
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:50,619
So if you wanna throw bad looks around,
throw 'em at a mirror!

515
00:32:50,703 --> 00:32:53,623
You kids shouldn't play so rough.

516
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:56,542
Somebody's gonna start cryin'.

517
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:58,252
Mr. Blonde.

518
00:33:00,381 --> 00:33:02,633
Shit. You're fuckin' kickin' me.

519
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:11,268
What happened to you?
Figured you were dead.

520
00:33:14,856 --> 00:33:17,567
Hey, you okay?

521
00:33:18,861 --> 00:33:21,197
Did you see what happened to Blue?

522
00:33:21,281 --> 00:33:24,910
We didn't know what happened to you.
That's what we were wonderin' about.

523
00:33:26,954 --> 00:33:29,748
Look, Brown is dead,
Orange got it in the belly.

524
00:33:29,832 --> 00:33:32,084
Enough! Enough!

525
00:33:32,127 --> 00:33:35,255
You better start talkin', asshole.

526
00:33:35,297 --> 00:33:38,175
'Cause we got shit
we need to talk about.

527
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:39,969
We're already freaked out.

528
00:33:40,053 --> 00:33:43,473
We need you actin' freaky
like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.

529
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,268
Okay, let's talk.

530
00:33:46,352 --> 00:33:48,771
We think we got
a rat in the house.

531
00:33:48,855 --> 00:33:50,857
I guarantee we got
a rat in the house.

532
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:52,734
What makes you say that?

533
00:33:52,818 --> 00:33:54,778
Is that supposed to be funny?

534
00:33:54,862 --> 00:33:57,615
Look, we think
this place ain't safe.

535
00:33:57,699 --> 00:34:00,452
This place ain't secure anymore.
We're leavin' and you should go with us.

536
00:34:00,535 --> 00:34:02,787
Nobody's goin' anywhere.

537
00:34:03,664 --> 00:34:06,375
Piss on this fuckin' turd.

538
00:34:06,459 --> 00:34:09,629
- We're outta here.
- Don't take another step, Mr. White.

539
00:34:09,671 --> 00:34:12,465
Fuck you, maniac!

540
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,263
It's your fuckin' fault
we're in this trouble!

541
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,891
What's this guy's problem?

542
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:22,895
What's my problem?
Yeah, I got a fuckin' problem!

543
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,772
I got a big fuckin' problem...

544
00:34:25,857 --> 00:34:28,860
with any trigger-happy madman
who almost gets me shot!

545
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:34,408
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
- That fucking shooting spree!

546
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,870
In the store! Remember?

547
00:34:37,955 --> 00:34:42,752
Oh, fuck 'em. They set off the alarm.
They deserve what they got.

548
00:34:42,835 --> 00:34:44,795
You almost killed me!

549
00:34:45,881 --> 00:34:47,174
Asshole!

550
00:34:49,552 --> 00:34:53,598
If I knew what kind of guy you were, I
never would've agreed to work with you.

551
00:34:55,141 --> 00:34:58,686
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...

552
00:34:58,771 --> 00:35:00,731
or are you gonna bite?

553
00:35:00,773 --> 00:35:02,900
What was that?

554
00:35:05,445 --> 00:35:09,366
I'm sorry, I didn't catch it.
Would you repeat it?

555
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:13,204
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...

556
00:35:14,373 --> 00:35:16,291
or are you gonna bite?

557
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:19,336
You two assholes, calm the fuck down!
Hey, come on!

558
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:23,007
What, are we on a playground here?
Am I the only professional?

559
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:25,427
You're actin' like
a bunch of fuckin' niggers!

560
00:35:25,511 --> 00:35:28,806
Ever work with niggers? Always sayin'
they're gonna kill each other.

561
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,808
You said yourself
you thought about taking him out.

562
00:35:30,892 --> 00:35:33,436
- You fuckin' said that?
- Yeah, I did, okay?

563
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,191
But that was then. Right now, this guy
is the only one I completely trust.

564
00:35:37,275 --> 00:35:40,069
-He's too homicidal to be with the cops.
-You takin' his side?

565
00:35:40,153 --> 00:35:43,156
Fuck sides, man!
What we need here is solidarity!

566
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,161
Somebody's stickin' a red-hot poker
up our ass, and I want to know who.

567
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:52,083
Fuck. Look, I know
I'm no piece of shit.

568
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:56,046
I'm pretty sure you're okay, and I'm
fuckin' positive you're on the level.

569
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,884
So let's try and figure out
who the bad guy is, all right?

570
00:36:02,304 --> 00:36:04,097
Wow.

571
00:36:04,181 --> 00:36:06,266
That was really exciting.

572
00:36:08,144 --> 00:36:11,105
I bet you're a big
Lee Marvin fan, aren't ya?

573
00:36:13,442 --> 00:36:16,487
Yeah, me too.
I love that guy.

574
00:36:18,114 --> 00:36:22,869
My heart's beatin' so fast,
I'm about to have a heart attack here.

575
00:36:22,954 --> 00:36:27,793
I got somethin' outside that
I'd like to show you guys, so follow me.

576
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:29,711
Follow you? Where?

577
00:36:30,713 --> 00:36:32,339
To my car.

578
00:36:33,508 --> 00:36:35,969
Did you forget your French fries
to go with the soda?

579
00:36:36,011 --> 00:36:39,807
No, I had them already. I got somethin'
I think you might wanna see, though.

580
00:36:39,848 --> 00:36:41,850
- What?
- It's a big surprise.

581
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:44,895
I'm sure you'll like it.
Come on.

582
00:36:54,825 --> 00:36:57,161
We still gotta get
outta here, you know.

583
00:36:57,202 --> 00:36:59,663
No. We're gonna stick around
and we're gonna wait.

584
00:36:59,705 --> 00:37:03,083
- What for? The cops?
- No. Nice Guy Eddie.

585
00:37:03,168 --> 00:37:07,673
Nice Guy Eddie? What makes you think he
isn't on a plane halfway to Costa Rica?

586
00:37:07,756 --> 00:37:11,093
Because I spoke to him on the phone
and he said he's on the way down here.

587
00:37:11,177 --> 00:37:14,389
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why
didn't you say that in the first place?

588
00:37:14,473 --> 00:37:17,267
- 'Cause you never asked me.
- Hardy-fuckin'-har.

589
00:37:17,351 --> 00:37:20,521
- What'd he say?
- He said stay put.

590
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:23,107
So in the meantime...

591
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:25,860
I'll show you guys somethin'.

592
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,035
Jesus Christ.

593
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:35,122
Maybe our boy in blue here
can answer some of these questions...

594
00:37:35,206 --> 00:37:38,543
about this rat business
you've been talkin' about.

595
00:37:38,626 --> 00:37:41,587
You're a piece of work,
my friend.

596
00:37:41,672 --> 00:37:43,716
Let's get him
the fuck outta here.

597
00:37:46,093 --> 00:37:48,345
Hey, Sid, will you relax?

598
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,682
I've known you a long time.
I'm not worried.

599
00:37:50,766 --> 00:37:53,268
I know you'll pay me back.

600
00:37:53,352 --> 00:37:57,106
Don't tell me what I already know.
Don't embarrass me.

601
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:01,278
So you had a few bad months.
You do what everybody else does.

602
00:38:01,361 --> 00:38:06,241
I don't care if it's J.P. Morgan
or lrving the tailor. You ride it out.

603
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,912
- Vic Vega's outside.
- Hold on.

604
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,039
- Who?
- Vic Vega.

605
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:13,876
Tell him to come in.
I gotta go.

606
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,421
- Come on in.
- A friend of mine's outside.

607
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:19,091
I'll be talkin' to you.
Don't worry.

608
00:38:23,721 --> 00:38:26,140
Hey, welcome home, Vic.

609
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:29,519
How does freedom feel, huh?

610
00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:32,773
- It's a change.
- Ain't that the sad truth.

611
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:35,777
Sit down, take your coat off,
make yourself at home.

612
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:37,779
- Have a little drink?
- Yeah.

613
00:38:37,863 --> 00:38:40,866
How about a little Remy Martin?

614
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,910
Sure.

615
00:38:42,994 --> 00:38:45,038
Who's your parole officer?

616
00:38:46,331 --> 00:38:48,416
Seymour Scagnetti.

617
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,044
How is he?

618
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:53,047
He's a fuckin' asshole.

619
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:55,091
Won't even let me
leave the halfway house.

620
00:38:55,175 --> 00:38:57,761
It never ceases to amaze me.

621
00:38:57,845 --> 00:39:02,016
A fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there,
slits a woman's throat for 25 cents...

622
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,936
he gets Doris Day
for a parole officer.

623
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,649
A good fella like you
winds up with a ball-bustin' prick.

624
00:39:10,693 --> 00:39:14,155
I want you to know I appreciate all
the packages you sent me on the inside.

625
00:39:14,197 --> 00:39:16,157
What the hell
was I supposed to do?

626
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,202
Forget about you?

627
00:39:18,244 --> 00:39:21,164
I just want you to know
that it meant a lot to me.

628
00:39:21,206 --> 00:39:24,835
It was the least I could do. I wish
to hell I could've done a lot more.

629
00:39:24,918 --> 00:39:27,879
Thanks a lot, Joe.

630
00:39:27,964 --> 00:39:29,382
Ah, Vic.

631
00:39:32,678 --> 00:39:34,596
Toothpick Vic.

632
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:40,270
So tell me your story, kid.
What are your plans?

633
00:39:40,353 --> 00:39:43,815
You son of a bitch. I see you
sittin' there, but I don't believe it.

634
00:39:43,899 --> 00:39:46,318
- How you doin', Toothpick?
- Hey, Eddie.

635
00:39:51,241 --> 00:39:54,327
Listen, I'm sorry.
I should've picked you up myself.

636
00:39:54,412 --> 00:39:57,040
I was-- My fuckin'--
This week's been crazy.

637
00:39:57,123 --> 00:39:59,375
I've had my head up my ass
the whole time.

638
00:39:59,459 --> 00:40:02,545
Funny you say that, 'cause that's what
me and your daddy were talkin' about.

639
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,548
That I should've picked you up?

640
00:40:04,632 --> 00:40:07,343
No, that you had
your head up your ass.

641
00:40:09,596 --> 00:40:11,681
I walk in the door, he's like,
"Vic, Vic...

642
00:40:11,766 --> 00:40:15,437
I'm so glad somebody's finally here
who knows what's goin' on.

643
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,106
My son Eddie's a fuck-up.

644
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:21,193
He's ruining the business.

645
00:40:21,277 --> 00:40:25,156
I mean, I love the guy, but he's
flushin' everything down the toilet."

646
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,410
That's what you said, right, Joe?
Tell him yourself.

647
00:40:28,452 --> 00:40:31,288
Eddie, I hate for you
to hear it like this...

648
00:40:31,372 --> 00:40:35,126
but Vic came in
and asked me how business was.

649
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:38,130
You don't lie to a guy who's
just done four years in the slammer.

650
00:40:38,213 --> 00:40:39,464
That's very true.

651
00:40:44,805 --> 00:40:47,266
All right, enough of this shit!
Break it up!

652
00:40:47,307 --> 00:40:49,601
Come on, this ain't a playground!

653
00:40:53,565 --> 00:40:58,654
You guys wanna roll around on the floor,
you do it in Eddie's office, not mine.

654
00:40:58,738 --> 00:41:01,574
- Daddy, did you see that?
- What?

655
00:41:01,658 --> 00:41:03,743
The guy got me on the ground,
he tried to fuck me.

656
00:41:03,827 --> 00:41:06,455
- You wish.
- You sick bastard, Vic.

657
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:08,958
You tried to fuck me
in my father's office.

658
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:12,294
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do
in the privacy of your own home...

659
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:14,631
go to it,
but don't try to fuck me.

660
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:16,842
I don't think of you that way.

661
00:41:16,926 --> 00:41:21,055
I like you a lot, buddy,
but I don't think of you that way.

662
00:41:23,016 --> 00:41:27,604
Listen, if I was a butt cowboy,
I wouldn't even throw you to the posse.

663
00:41:27,689 --> 00:41:31,109
No, you wouldn't.
You'd keep me for yourself.

664
00:41:31,193 --> 00:41:35,531
Four years fuckin' punks up the ass,
you'd appreciate a piece of prime rib.

665
00:41:35,615 --> 00:41:38,993
I might break you in, Nice Guy,
but I'd make you my dog's bitch.

666
00:41:39,077 --> 00:41:40,662
Ain't that a sad sight, Daddy?

667
00:41:40,746 --> 00:41:43,999
A man walks into prison a white man,
walks out talkin' like a fuckin' nigger.

668
00:41:44,041 --> 00:41:47,044
You know what?
I think it's all that black semen...

669
00:41:47,086 --> 00:41:49,630
pumped up your asshole, now it's
backed into your fuckin' brain...

670
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,551
and it's comin' out your mouth!

671
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:56,514
Eddie, you keep talkin' like a bitch,
I'm gonna slap you like a bitch.

672
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:59,434
Enough of that shit!
I'm sick of it!

673
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:01,687
Now both of you, sit down.

674
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,029
Now, Eddie...

675
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:12,074
when you came in here,
we were talkin' some serious business.

676
00:42:13,242 --> 00:42:15,202
Vic here's got a parole problem.

677
00:42:15,286 --> 00:42:18,206
- Who's your P.O.?
- Seymour Scagnetti.

678
00:42:18,248 --> 00:42:20,876
Scagnetti. Fuck.

679
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,006
- I hear he's a motherfucker.
- Oh, he's a fucker.

680
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:28,302
Won't even let me leave the halfway
house unless I get some shitty job.

681
00:42:28,385 --> 00:42:30,721
You're comin' back
to work for us, right?

682
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,186
Well, I wanna.

683
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:39,106
But first I gotta prove to,
uh, ass-head...

684
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:42,610
that I can get a regular,
you know, job-type job...

685
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:45,822
before I can move out on my own.

686
00:42:45,906 --> 00:42:49,243
I can't come back to work for you guys
if I gotta worry about, uh...

687
00:42:49,285 --> 00:42:51,704
makin' some silly-ass
10:00 curfew...

688
00:42:51,788 --> 00:42:53,706
every fuckin' night.

689
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:57,210
We can work this out,
can't we, Eddie?

690
00:42:57,294 --> 00:42:59,212
This ain't all that bad.

691
00:42:59,297 --> 00:43:02,342
We can get you
a lot of legitimate jobs.

692
00:43:02,425 --> 00:43:05,261
I'll get you down in Long Beach
as a dockworker.

693
00:43:05,304 --> 00:43:08,641
I don't wanna lift
no fuckin' crates, Eddie.

694
00:43:08,725 --> 00:43:12,229
You ain't gonna lift shit.
You don't even work there.

695
00:43:12,312 --> 00:43:15,315
But as far as the records
are concerned, you do.

696
00:43:15,399 --> 00:43:19,278
I call Matthews and tell him he's got
a new guy, boom, you're on the rotation.

697
00:43:19,362 --> 00:43:23,241
You get a time card. It's clocked
in and out for you every day.

698
00:43:23,325 --> 00:43:27,955
At the end of the week you get a nice
paycheck. Dockworkers do very well.

699
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:30,667
You can move into a halfway decent place
without Scagnetti goin'...

700
00:43:30,751 --> 00:43:33,003
"Where the fuck's
the money comin' from?"

701
00:43:33,087 --> 00:43:36,591
And, if he decides
to make a surprise visit...

702
00:43:36,674 --> 00:43:40,970
that's the day we sent you to Tustin
to pick up a load of shit.

703
00:43:41,054 --> 00:43:44,224
If he comes back again, hey,
"Sorry, Seymour.

704
00:43:44,308 --> 00:43:45,934
You just missed him.

705
00:43:46,019 --> 00:43:49,481
We had to send him to the Taft airstrip
five fuckin' hours away.

706
00:43:49,564 --> 00:43:52,317
We had a load of shit he had to
pick up there and bring back here."

707
00:43:52,401 --> 00:43:55,988
Part of your job is goin' different
places. That's the beauty of it.

708
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,658
We got places all over the place.

709
00:43:58,742 --> 00:44:00,994
See, Vic?
Did I tell you not to worry?

710
00:44:01,078 --> 00:44:04,999
- Vic was worried.
- I'll take you to Long Beach tomorrow.

711
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:09,004
We'll get you fixed up with Matthews,
I'll tell him what's what.

712
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:13,384
You know, I really appreciate
what you guys are doin'...

713
00:44:13,468 --> 00:44:16,179
but I'd like to know
when I can come back...

714
00:44:16,263 --> 00:44:18,515
you know, do some real work.

715
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:20,935
Well, it's hard to say.

716
00:44:21,018 --> 00:44:23,854
It's kind of a strange time now.

717
00:44:23,897 --> 00:44:26,358
Things are kind of--

718
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,486
They're a little fucked up,
is what they are.

719
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:32,656
We're just gettin' ready for
a big meetin' right now in Vegas.

720
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:37,287
Look, just let Eddie for now
set you up at Long Beach.

721
00:44:37,371 --> 00:44:40,666
Get you a job,
give you some cash...

722
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,878
and get this Scagnetti fuck
off your back...

723
00:44:43,962 --> 00:44:47,174
and then we'll talk
to you, all right?

724
00:44:47,258 --> 00:44:48,342
Huh?

725
00:44:48,426 --> 00:44:52,055
Dad, I got an idea.

726
00:44:52,138 --> 00:44:54,891
Just hear me out.

727
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:58,478
I know you don't like usin'
the boys on these jobs...

728
00:44:58,563 --> 00:45:03,026
but Vic here-- I mean, he's only
been nothin' but good luck for us.

729
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:06,071
The guy's a fuckin' rabbit's foot,
for cryin' out loud.

730
00:45:07,281 --> 00:45:09,575
I'd like to have him in.

731
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:13,330
You know he can handle himself, and
you damn sure know you can trust him.

732
00:45:14,957 --> 00:45:17,001
All right, Vic...

733
00:45:17,085 --> 00:45:21,173
how would you feel about pullin'
a job with about five other guys?

734
00:45:23,842 --> 00:45:25,886
I'd feel great about it.

735
00:45:30,684 --> 00:45:34,396
K-BILLY's "Super Sounds
of the '70s" continues.

736
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,565
If you're the 12th caller...

737
00:45:36,649 --> 00:45:40,069
you'll win two tickets to
the monster truck extravaganza...

738
00:45:40,153 --> 00:45:43,406
being held tonight
at the Carson Fairgrounds...

739
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:48,496
featuring Big Daddy Don Bodine's truck,
"The Behemoth."

740
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:53,460
The 12th caller wins on the station
where the '70s survived.

741
00:45:58,634 --> 00:46:02,096
Hey, Dov, we got
a major situation here.

742
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:05,683
I know you know that. I gotta talk to
Daddy and find out what he wants done.

743
00:46:13,526 --> 00:46:17,947
All I know is what Vic told me.
The place turned into a bullet-fest.

744
00:46:18,032 --> 00:46:20,493
He took a cop hostage
just to get the fuck outta there.

745
00:46:20,576 --> 00:46:22,536
Get up! Get up!

746
00:46:25,707 --> 00:46:27,876
Do I sound like
I'm fuckin' jokin'?

747
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,337
He's fuckin' drivin' around
with a cop in his trunk!

748
00:46:35,093 --> 00:46:37,011
I don't know who did what!

749
00:46:37,096 --> 00:46:40,224
I don't know who's got the loot.
I don't know if anybody's got the loot.

750
00:46:40,308 --> 00:46:44,187
I don't know who's dead, who's alive,
who's caught, who's not.

751
00:46:59,914 --> 00:47:02,875
I will know.
I'm practically there now.

752
00:47:04,086 --> 00:47:06,922
But what do I tell
these guys about Daddy?

753
00:47:09,134 --> 00:47:12,346
All right.
You sure that's what he said?

754
00:47:13,806 --> 00:47:16,058
Okay, that's what I'll tell 'em.

755
00:47:16,142 --> 00:47:18,144
Huh? Fuck you!

756
00:47:18,228 --> 00:47:20,730
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?

757
00:47:20,814 --> 00:47:22,357
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?

758
00:47:25,653 --> 00:47:28,406
You're gonna suffer
for nothin', pal.

759
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:30,826
You hear me?
'Cause you're gonna fuckin' talk.

760
00:47:30,909 --> 00:47:33,870
- I don't fucking know anything!
- You fuckin' know.

761
00:47:33,955 --> 00:47:36,499
You know. Look at me.
You fuckin' know.

762
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:39,044
What in the Sam Hill's
goin' on here?

763
00:47:39,127 --> 00:47:42,213
- Nice Guy, we got a cop.
- Where the fuck is Joe?

764
00:47:43,466 --> 00:47:45,468
Holy shit. Orange is dead.

765
00:47:45,552 --> 00:47:49,431
No, he's not dead, but he will be
if we don't get him taken care of.

766
00:47:49,515 --> 00:47:51,934
We were set up.
The cops were there waitin' for us.

767
00:47:52,018 --> 00:47:54,354
What? Nobody fuckin'
set anybody up.

768
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:56,063
The cops were there
waitin' for us.

769
00:47:56,147 --> 00:47:57,815
- Bullshit.
- Fuck you, man!

770
00:47:57,899 --> 00:48:01,236
You weren't there, we were,
and the cops had that store staked out.

771
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,615
Okay, Mr. Fuckin' Detective,
you're so fuckin' smart.

772
00:48:04,699 --> 00:48:07,994
- Who did it?
- We've been askin' each other!

773
00:48:08,078 --> 00:48:11,081
What'd you come up with?
You think I fuckin' set you up?

774
00:48:11,165 --> 00:48:13,918
I don't know, but somebody did.

775
00:48:15,212 --> 00:48:18,757
Nobody did. You fuckin' assholes
turned the jewelry store--

776
00:48:18,841 --> 00:48:21,844
- Don't you call me an asshole!
- You fuckin' idiot!

777
00:48:21,928 --> 00:48:23,972
Turned the jewelry store
into a wild west show...

778
00:48:24,055 --> 00:48:26,474
and you wonder why
the fuckin' cops show up?

779
00:48:28,018 --> 00:48:29,436
Where's Joseph?

780
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,730
I don't know.
I ain't talked to him.

781
00:48:31,815 --> 00:48:36,236
I talked to Dov. He says Daddy's comin'
down here and he's fuckin' pissed.

782
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,781
He's pissed?
I told you he'd be pissed.

783
00:48:38,865 --> 00:48:40,325
What'd Joe say?

784
00:48:40,408 --> 00:48:42,326
I told you,
I ain't talked to him!

785
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:45,330
- All I know is he's pissed.
- What are you gonna do about him?

786
00:48:45,414 --> 00:48:49,460
Give me a fuckin' chance to breathe.
I got a few questions of my own here.

787
00:48:49,544 --> 00:48:51,004
You ain't dying. He is.

788
00:48:51,087 --> 00:48:54,591
All right, Mr. Fuckin' Compassion,
I will call somebody!

789
00:48:54,675 --> 00:48:56,427
Who?

790
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:59,930
A fuckin' snake charmer!
Who do you think? I'll call a doctor.

791
00:49:00,015 --> 00:49:03,894
They'll fix him right up.
What happened to Brown and Blue?

792
00:49:03,978 --> 00:49:06,230
Brown's dead.
We don't know what happened to Blue.

793
00:49:06,314 --> 00:49:08,191
Brown's dead? Are you sure?

794
00:49:08,274 --> 00:49:12,237
I'm sure. I was there.
He took one in the head.

795
00:49:12,321 --> 00:49:14,573
Nobody's got a clue
what happened to Mr. Blue?

796
00:49:14,657 --> 00:49:16,867
Either he's alive or he's dead...

797
00:49:16,951 --> 00:49:19,954
or the cops got him
or they don't.

798
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:25,419
I take it this is the bastard
you told me about.

799
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,421
Why are you beatin' on him?

800
00:49:27,505 --> 00:49:29,882
Maybe he could tell us
who set us up.

801
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:34,138
You beat this prick long enough, he'll
tell you he started the Chicago Fire.

802
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:37,016
Now that don't necessarily
make it fuckin' so!

803
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,310
Come on, man, think!

804
00:49:39,394 --> 00:49:42,814
All right,
first things fuckin' last.

805
00:49:42,899 --> 00:49:47,362
Who's got the stones? Please, somebody
tell me one little fuckin' favor.

806
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:48,989
I got a bag.

807
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:53,118
Okay? I stashed it 'til we could be sure
this place wasn't a police station.

808
00:49:53,202 --> 00:49:55,454
Good for you.
Now let's go get it.

809
00:49:55,538 --> 00:49:59,793
First we gotta get rid of those cars.
It looks like Sam's Hot Car Lot outside.

810
00:49:59,877 --> 00:50:00,878
Okay.

811
00:50:00,962 --> 00:50:04,841
Blondie, stay here
and baby-sit them two.

812
00:50:04,925 --> 00:50:07,636
White and Pink,
take a car each.

813
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,265
I'll follow you. You ditch 'em.
Pick up the stones.

814
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:14,477
While I'm followin' you, I'll arrange
some sort of a doctor for our friend.

815
00:50:14,561 --> 00:50:16,479
You can't leave these guys
here with him.

816
00:50:16,563 --> 00:50:20,025
- Why not?
- Because he's a fuckin' psycho.

817
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:23,404
And if you think
Joe's pissed off...

818
00:50:23,446 --> 00:50:26,366
that ain't nothin' compared
to how pissed off I am at him...

819
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:28,619
for puttin' me
in the same room as that bastard.

820
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:33,291
You see what I've been
puttin' up with, Eddie?

821
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:38,380
I fuckin' walked in here,
I told these guys about stayin' put.

822
00:50:38,464 --> 00:50:41,467
Mr. White whips out his gun,
he's stickin' it in my face...

823
00:50:41,551 --> 00:50:45,388
callin' me a motherfucker,
sayin' he's gonna blow me away...

824
00:50:45,472 --> 00:50:47,641
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

825
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:51,103
He's the reason the joint
turned into a shootin' spree.

826
00:50:51,188 --> 00:50:53,774
What are you,
a fuckin' silent partner?

827
00:50:53,857 --> 00:50:55,650
Tell him!

828
00:50:55,735 --> 00:50:58,279
He went crazy in the store,
but he seems all right now.

829
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:03,285
This is what he was doin':
bam, bam...

830
00:51:03,369 --> 00:51:06,122
bam, bam.

831
00:51:06,205 --> 00:51:08,499
Yeah, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

832
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:11,669
I told 'em not to touch
the fuckin' alarm, they did.

833
00:51:11,753 --> 00:51:16,300
If they hadn't have done what I told 'em
not to do, they'd still be alive.

834
00:51:18,011 --> 00:51:20,096
My fuckin' hero.

835
00:51:21,765 --> 00:51:23,809
Thanks.

836
00:51:23,893 --> 00:51:26,646
That's your excuse for going
on a kill-crazy rampage?

837
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,815
I don't like alarms, Mr. White.

838
00:51:32,361 --> 00:51:34,697
What does it matter
who stays with the cop?

839
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:36,824
We ain't lettin' him go.
He's seen everybody.

840
00:51:36,908 --> 00:51:38,952
I haven't been looking at you guys.

841
00:51:39,036 --> 00:51:41,497
Shut the fuck up, man!

842
00:51:41,539 --> 00:51:44,417
You guys should never have taken him
outta the trunk in the first place.

843
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:48,547
- We tried to find out about the setup.
- There is no fuckin' setup!

844
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:50,340
Now here's the news!

845
00:51:50,424 --> 00:51:53,510
Blondie, you stay here,
take care of these two!

846
00:51:53,553 --> 00:51:55,847
White and Pink, you come with me,
'cause if Joe gets here...

847
00:51:55,931 --> 00:51:58,100
and he sees all these
cars parked outside...

848
00:51:58,183 --> 00:52:01,186
I swear to you he's gonna be
just as mad at me as he is at you.

849
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:03,355
Fine. Let's go.

850
00:52:24,089 --> 00:52:26,049
Alone at last.

851
00:52:47,492 --> 00:52:49,869
Guess what.

852
00:52:49,953 --> 00:52:52,622
I think I'm parked in the red zone.

853
00:52:57,795 --> 00:53:00,548
Now, where were we?

854
00:53:02,009 --> 00:53:05,387
I told you, I don't know anything
about any fuckin' setup.

855
00:53:06,889 --> 00:53:08,891
I've been on the force
for only eight months.

856
00:53:08,975 --> 00:53:11,227
They don't tell me anything.

857
00:53:12,771 --> 00:53:15,774
Nobody tells me shit.
You can torture me all you want.

858
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:18,111
Torture you?
That's a good--

859
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:21,323
That's a good idea.
I like that one, yeah.

860
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:25,995
Even your boss said
there wasn't a setup.

861
00:53:27,581 --> 00:53:30,667
- My what?
- Your boss.

862
00:53:31,752 --> 00:53:33,670
Excuse me, pal.

863
00:53:33,755 --> 00:53:37,759
One thing I wanna make clear to you:
I don't have a boss.

864
00:53:37,843 --> 00:53:40,929
Nobody tells me what to do.
You understand?

865
00:53:41,013 --> 00:53:43,515
You hear what I said,
you son of a bitch?

866
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,686
All right, all right, all right,
you don't have a boss.

867
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:51,859
Get that fuckin' shit off.

868
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:03,205
Look, I'm not gonna
bullshit you, okay?

869
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:07,878
I don't really give a good fuck
what you know or don't know...

870
00:54:09,297 --> 00:54:11,841
but I'm gonna
torture you anyway...

871
00:54:13,844 --> 00:54:15,387
regardless.

872
00:54:15,471 --> 00:54:17,765
Not to get information.

873
00:54:19,392 --> 00:54:21,352
It's amusing to me...

874
00:54:21,436 --> 00:54:23,855
to torture a cop.

875
00:54:23,897 --> 00:54:27,109
You can say anything you want
because I've heard it all before.

876
00:54:28,736 --> 00:54:30,905
All you can do is...

877
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:33,157
pray for a quick death...

878
00:54:35,786 --> 00:54:38,372
which...

879
00:54:38,456 --> 00:54:40,625
you ain't gonna get.

880
00:54:55,852 --> 00:54:57,645
Oh, God.

881
00:55:05,905 --> 00:55:09,909
You ever listen to K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s"?

882
00:55:13,331 --> 00:55:15,625
It's my personal favorite.

883
00:55:21,799 --> 00:55:26,471
Joe Egan and Gerry Rafferty
were a duo known as Stealer's Wheel...

884
00:55:26,513 --> 00:55:30,642
when they recorded this Dylanesque,
pop, bubble-gum favorite...

885
00:55:30,726 --> 00:55:33,812
from April of 1974.

886
00:55:33,896 --> 00:55:35,814
That reached up to number five...

887
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:39,277
as K-BILLY's "Super Sounds
of the '70s" continues.

888
00:56:28,294 --> 00:56:30,421
Hold still.

889
00:56:30,505 --> 00:56:32,632
Hold still, you fuck.

890
00:56:53,073 --> 00:56:55,492
Was that good for you too?

891
00:56:56,244 --> 00:56:58,079
Hey, what's goin' on?

892
00:56:58,121 --> 00:56:59,581
You hear that?

893
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,512
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

894
00:58:56,719 --> 00:58:59,180
Don't! Stop! Stop!

895
00:59:00,557 --> 00:59:03,518
- What? What's the matter?
- Don't do this.

896
00:59:04,771 --> 00:59:06,689
That burn a little bit?

897
00:59:07,566 --> 00:59:09,192
Don't! Stop!

898
00:59:12,113 --> 00:59:13,906
Please stop.

899
00:59:13,948 --> 00:59:16,158
Just stop. Stop.

900
00:59:16,242 --> 00:59:18,160
Just talk to me.
Don't. Please.

901
00:59:18,245 --> 00:59:19,871
Don't burn me, please.

902
00:59:23,084 --> 00:59:26,713
I don't know anything about
any of you fucking guys.

903
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:28,715
I'm not gonna say anything.

904
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:32,094
No! Please, no.

905
00:59:32,178 --> 00:59:33,679
- You all through?
- Stop!

906
00:59:33,763 --> 00:59:34,847
You all through?

907
00:59:34,931 --> 00:59:38,435
Please.
I got a little kid at home.

908
00:59:39,061 --> 00:59:40,229
You all done?

909
00:59:40,271 --> 00:59:42,231
- Don't!
- Have some fire.

910
01:00:46,349 --> 01:00:48,309
Oh, shit.

911
01:00:50,354 --> 01:00:51,814
Hey, you.

912
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:56,986
What's your name?

913
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:01,450
Marvin.

914
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:04,703
Marvin what?

915
01:01:09,001 --> 01:01:10,502
Marvin Nash.

916
01:01:17,052 --> 01:01:18,970
Listen to me, Marvin.
I'm a--

917
01:01:21,724 --> 01:01:24,685
Listen to me, Marvin Nash.
I'm a cop.

918
01:01:26,563 --> 01:01:28,315
Yeah, I know.

919
01:01:30,818 --> 01:01:32,403
You do?

920
01:01:33,571 --> 01:01:36,866
Yeah.
Your name's Freddy somethin'.

921
01:01:37,993 --> 01:01:39,578
Newendyke.

922
01:01:40,788 --> 01:01:42,748
Freddy Newendyke.

923
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:48,755
Frankie Ferchetti...

924
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:52,718
introduced us
about five months ago.

925
01:01:55,639 --> 01:01:58,100
I don't remember that at all.

926
01:02:01,271 --> 01:02:03,189
I do.

927
01:02:06,193 --> 01:02:08,654
Freddy.

928
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,791
How do I look?

929
01:02:21,545 --> 01:02:22,963
What?

930
01:02:30,597 --> 01:02:33,517
I don't know what to tell you,
Marvin.

931
01:02:37,146 --> 01:02:38,731
That fuck.

932
01:02:41,276 --> 01:02:43,695
That sick fuck!

933
01:02:43,779 --> 01:02:46,699
That fuckin' bastard!

934
01:02:48,618 --> 01:02:52,038
Marvin, I need you to hold on.

935
01:02:52,123 --> 01:02:55,043
There's cops waiting to move
a block away.

936
01:02:56,127 --> 01:02:59,213
What the fuck
are they waiting for?

937
01:02:59,298 --> 01:03:02,510
This fuckin' guy,
he slashes my face...

938
01:03:02,551 --> 01:03:05,053
and cuts my fuckin' ear off!

939
01:03:05,138 --> 01:03:07,348
I'm fuckin' deformed!

940
01:03:07,391 --> 01:03:08,976
Fuck you!

941
01:03:10,352 --> 01:03:12,354
I'm fuckin' dyin' here!

942
01:03:12,438 --> 01:03:14,523
I'm fuckin' dyin'!

943
01:03:22,951 --> 01:03:26,997
They're not to make a move
'til Joe Cabot shows up.

944
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:29,875
I was sent in to get him.

945
01:03:29,917 --> 01:03:31,502
All right?

946
01:03:31,586 --> 01:03:34,547
You heard 'em.
They said he's on his way.

947
01:03:34,589 --> 01:03:37,050
Don't pussy out on me now,
Marvin.

948
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:41,264
We're just gonna sit here
and bleed...

949
01:03:41,347 --> 01:03:44,767
'til Joe Cabot sticks
his fuckin' head through that door.

950
01:04:05,501 --> 01:04:07,753
Say hello to a motherfucker
who's inside.

951
01:04:07,837 --> 01:04:10,673
Cabot's doing a job.
He wants me on the team.

952
01:04:10,757 --> 01:04:13,218
This better not be a joke.

953
01:04:13,302 --> 01:04:16,973
This ain't a joke.
I'm in. I'm up his ass.

954
01:04:24,607 --> 01:04:27,527
Nice Guy Eddie tells me
Joe wants to meet me.

955
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:31,531
He says I should just wait
for a phone call.

956
01:04:31,615 --> 01:04:35,953
After waiting three days he calls me
last night and says Joe's ready.

957
01:04:36,037 --> 01:04:39,040
- He'll pick me up in 15 minutes.
- Who picked you up?

958
01:04:39,124 --> 01:04:41,752
- Nice Guy. We get to a bar.
- What bar?

959
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:43,337
Smokey Pete's in Gardena.

960
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,964
We get there...

961
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:48,051
and I meet Joe
and a guy named Mr. White.

962
01:04:48,135 --> 01:04:50,053
Phony name.
My name's Mr. Orange.

963
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:52,890
- Mr. Orange?
- Mr. Orange.

964
01:04:54,142 --> 01:04:56,060
Okay, Mr. Orange.

965
01:04:56,144 --> 01:04:59,815
- You ever see this motherfucker before?
- Who? Mr. White?

966
01:04:59,898 --> 01:05:01,524
Yes. Mr. White.

967
01:05:02,235 --> 01:05:07,157
No. He ain't one of Cabot's men either.
He's gotta be from out of town.

968
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,409
- Joe knows him good.
- How can you tell?

969
01:05:09,493 --> 01:05:12,496
The way they talk.
You can tell they're buddies.

970
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:14,665
- You two talk?
- Me and Joe?

971
01:05:15,542 --> 01:05:16,751
Mr. White.

972
01:05:16,835 --> 01:05:18,378
- A little.
- About what?

973
01:05:18,462 --> 01:05:19,546
The Brewers.

974
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:21,006
Milwaukee Brewers?

975
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:24,176
They won the night before.
He made some money off them.

976
01:05:24,261 --> 01:05:29,058
Good. If this crook's a Brewers fan,
he's gotta be from Wisconsin.

977
01:05:29,141 --> 01:05:31,935
And I'll bet you everything...

978
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:35,106
they got a sheet in Milwaukee
on this Mr. White's ass.

979
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:39,486
So I want you to go through
everybody in Milwaukee...

980
01:05:39,529 --> 01:05:42,991
with a history of armed robbery
and put a name to the face.

981
01:05:43,074 --> 01:05:45,576
- Nice work, Freddy.
- Thank you, my man.

982
01:05:46,829 --> 01:05:49,331
- How was Long Beach Mike's referral?
- Perfect.

983
01:05:49,374 --> 01:05:53,629
His backing me up went a long way.
I told them I played poker with him.

984
01:05:53,712 --> 01:05:56,632
Nice Guy checked it out
and said it was A-okay.

985
01:05:56,716 --> 01:05:59,636
Said I was a good thief,
I didn't rattle...

986
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:02,055
and that I was ready to move.

987
01:06:02,139 --> 01:06:04,808
He's a good guy.
I wouldn't be inside without him.

988
01:06:06,894 --> 01:06:09,271
Long Beach Mike
is not your friend.

989
01:06:09,355 --> 01:06:11,607
Long Beach Mike
is a fucking scumbag.

990
01:06:11,692 --> 01:06:13,610
He's selling out his friends.

991
01:06:13,694 --> 01:06:16,488
That's how nice he fuckin' is.

992
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:18,532
I'll take care of his ass...

993
01:06:18,616 --> 01:06:22,453
but you get that scumbag out of mind
and take care of business.

994
01:06:22,538 --> 01:06:24,123
Gone.

995
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,840
Use the commode story?

996
01:06:31,924 --> 01:06:35,386
- What's the commode story?
- It's a scene. Memorize it.

997
01:06:37,347 --> 01:06:40,642
- A what?
- Undercover cops gotta be Brando.

998
01:06:40,726 --> 01:06:43,938
To do this job you gotta be
a great actor, naturalistic.

999
01:06:44,021 --> 01:06:46,774
You gotta be naturalistic as hell.

1000
01:06:46,816 --> 01:06:51,780
If you're a bad actor,
that's bullshit in this job.

1001
01:06:51,864 --> 01:06:53,198
What is this?

1002
01:06:53,282 --> 01:06:56,202
That's an amusing anecdote
about a drug deal.

1003
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:02,585
Something funny that happened to you
while you were doing a job.

1004
01:07:02,627 --> 01:07:06,005
I gotta memorize all this?
There's four pages of this shit.

1005
01:07:06,089 --> 01:07:08,758
Think about it like it's a joke.

1006
01:07:08,801 --> 01:07:11,971
Memorize what's important.
The rest you make your own.

1007
01:07:12,055 --> 01:07:13,973
You can tell a joke,
can't you?

1008
01:07:15,142 --> 01:07:17,060
Well, pretend you're Don Rickles...

1009
01:07:17,144 --> 01:07:19,062
and tell a joke, all right?

1010
01:07:19,146 --> 01:07:21,940
The things you gotta remember
are the details.

1011
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:23,985
The details sell your story.

1012
01:07:24,069 --> 01:07:27,114
This particular story
takes place in a men's room.

1013
01:07:27,197 --> 01:07:29,825
You gotta know
all the details--

1014
01:07:29,909 --> 01:07:33,746
whether they got paper towels
or a blower to dry your hands.

1015
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:37,501
You gotta know if the stalls
ain't got no doors or not.

1016
01:07:37,543 --> 01:07:40,629
You gotta know if they got liquid soap
or that pink, granulated shit...

1017
01:07:40,713 --> 01:07:42,673
they used in high school.

1018
01:07:42,716 --> 01:07:45,677
You gotta know if they got
hot water or not, if it stinks...

1019
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:49,097
if some nasty, lowlife,
scum-ridden motherfucker...

1020
01:07:49,182 --> 01:07:51,601
sprayed diarrhea
all over one of the bowls.

1021
01:07:51,685 --> 01:07:55,063
You gotta know every detail
there is to know about this commode.

1022
01:07:55,147 --> 01:08:00,027
What you gotta do is take
all them details and make 'em your own.

1023
01:08:00,111 --> 01:08:03,990
While you're doing that, remember
that this story is about you...

1024
01:08:04,033 --> 01:08:07,286
and how you perceived
the events that went down.

1025
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:09,288
The only way to do that...

1026
01:08:10,373 --> 01:08:12,291
is keep sayin' it...

1027
01:08:12,376 --> 01:08:14,795
and sayin' it and sayin' it.

1028
01:08:18,258 --> 01:08:23,097
This is during
the L.A. marijuana drought, 1986.

1029
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:26,558
I still had a connection,
which was insane 'cause...

1030
01:08:26,601 --> 01:08:28,811
you couldn't get any weed
anywhere then.

1031
01:08:30,355 --> 01:08:34,276
Anyway, I had a connection with
this hippie chick in Santa Cruz...

1032
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,278
and all my friends knew it.

1033
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:39,031
They call me and say,
"Hey, Freddy--"

1034
01:08:40,701 --> 01:08:42,828
I say, "Hey, dude.

1035
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:47,083
You gettin' some?
Can you get some for me too?"

1036
01:08:47,167 --> 01:08:51,922
They knew I still smoked,
so they asked me to buy some for them.

1037
01:08:51,964 --> 01:08:53,424
It got to be--

1038
01:08:59,098 --> 01:09:03,478
Every time I bought some weed
I was buyin' for four or five people.

1039
01:09:03,561 --> 01:09:08,149
Finally I said, fuck this shit.
I'm makin' this bitch rich.

1040
01:09:08,233 --> 01:09:11,611
She didn't even have to
meet these people.

1041
01:09:11,696 --> 01:09:13,614
I was doing all the work.

1042
01:09:13,698 --> 01:09:18,036
That got to be a pain in the ass,
people calling all the time.

1043
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:21,791
I couldn't even rent a tape
without six fuckin' interruptions.

1044
01:09:21,875 --> 01:09:23,960
"When's the next time
you're gettin' some?"

1045
01:09:24,044 --> 01:09:26,463
"Motherfucker, I'm tryin'
to watch The Lost Boys.

1046
01:09:26,505 --> 01:09:28,465
When I get some,
I'll call you."

1047
01:09:29,550 --> 01:09:31,969
Then these rink-a-dink
potheads come by.

1048
01:09:32,053 --> 01:09:34,514
They're my friends and everything,
but still--

1049
01:09:34,598 --> 01:09:37,976
I got it laid out in 60-dollar bags,
they don't want 60 dollars worth.

1050
01:09:38,019 --> 01:09:41,397
They want ten dollars' worth,
and breaking it up wasn't easy.

1051
01:09:41,481 --> 01:09:45,068
I don't even know
what ten dollars' worth looks like.

1052
01:09:45,152 --> 01:09:47,321
This was a very weird situation.

1053
01:09:48,531 --> 01:09:50,741
Remember back in '86...

1054
01:09:50,825 --> 01:09:53,161
there was a major
fuckin' drought.

1055
01:09:53,245 --> 01:09:54,663
Nobody had anything.

1056
01:09:54,747 --> 01:09:58,042
People were livin' on resin,
smokin' the wood in their pipes.

1057
01:09:58,126 --> 01:10:02,047
This chick had a bunch
and she's beggin' me to sell it.

1058
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:05,050
So I told her I wasn't gonna be
Joe the pot man anymore...

1059
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:09,013
but I would take a little bit
and sell it to my close friends.

1060
01:10:09,097 --> 01:10:11,641
She agreed and we kept
the same arrangement as before--

1061
01:10:11,683 --> 01:10:13,643
ten percent
and free pot for me...

1062
01:10:13,686 --> 01:10:15,646
if I helped her
that weekend.

1063
01:10:15,688 --> 01:10:19,025
She was sellin' a brick of weed
and didn't wanna go to the buy alone.

1064
01:10:19,067 --> 01:10:22,571
Her brother usually goes with her,
but he's in County unexpectedly.

1065
01:10:22,655 --> 01:10:23,739
What for?

1066
01:10:23,823 --> 01:10:25,658
His traffic tickets
gone to warrant.

1067
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:29,537
They stopped him, found warrants
on him, took him to County.

1068
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:32,541
She doesn't wanna walk around alone
with all that weed.

1069
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:36,379
I don't wanna do this.
I have a very bad feeling about it.

1070
01:10:36,463 --> 01:10:38,423
She keeps asking me, asking me.

1071
01:10:38,507 --> 01:10:41,427
Finally I said okay
'cause I'm sick of hearing it.

1072
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:43,762
- So we go to the train station--
- Wait.

1073
01:10:43,846 --> 01:10:46,849
You're goin' to the train station
with the weed on ya?

1074
01:10:46,933 --> 01:10:49,102
The guy needed it right away.

1075
01:10:49,186 --> 01:10:51,522
Anyway, we get to
the train station...

1076
01:10:51,564 --> 01:10:53,524
and we're waitin' for the guy.

1077
01:10:53,566 --> 01:10:56,194
I'm carryin' the weed
in a carry-on bag.

1078
01:10:56,236 --> 01:11:00,949
I gotta take a piss, so I tell her
I'm goin' to the boy's room.

1079
01:11:05,247 --> 01:11:08,208
So I walk into the men's room
and who's standing there?

1080
01:11:09,877 --> 01:11:13,297
Four Los Angeles County sheriffs
and a German shepherd.

1081
01:11:15,509 --> 01:11:18,971
- They're waitin' for you?
- No, they're just talkin'.

1082
01:11:19,055 --> 01:11:22,058
When I walked in,
they all stopped talkin'...

1083
01:11:22,142 --> 01:11:24,519
and they looked at me.

1084
01:11:24,603 --> 01:11:27,397
That's hard.
That's a fuckin' hard situation.

1085
01:11:28,441 --> 01:11:30,109
German shepherd starts barking.

1086
01:11:31,861 --> 01:11:33,404
He's barkin' at me.

1087
01:11:33,488 --> 01:11:36,074
I mean, it's obvious
he's barkin' at me.

1088
01:11:37,994 --> 01:11:41,790
Every nerve ending, all of my senses,
the blood in the veins was screamin':

1089
01:11:41,832 --> 01:11:45,836
"Take off, man. Just bail.
Get the fuck outta there."

1090
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,422
Panic hits me
like a bucket of water.

1091
01:11:48,464 --> 01:11:49,965
Bam! Right in the face.

1092
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:54,972
I'm drenched in panic and these cops
are lookin' at me and they know it.

1093
01:11:55,056 --> 01:11:58,476
They can smell it,
sure as that fuckin' dog can.

1094
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,478
They can smell it on me.

1095
01:12:01,355 --> 01:12:02,940
Shut up.

1096
01:12:04,316 --> 01:12:07,444
So anyway,
I got my gun drawn.

1097
01:12:07,487 --> 01:12:10,448
I point it at this guy
and I tell him...

1098
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:12,951
"Freeze.
Don't fuckin' move."

1099
01:12:12,993 --> 01:12:15,996
This little idiot's
looking right at me and saying...

1100
01:12:16,039 --> 01:12:17,874
"I know, I know."

1101
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:21,378
But meanwhile his right hand
is creepin' toward the glove box.

1102
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:26,301
I scream at him, "Asshole!
I'm gonna blow you away right now!

1103
01:12:26,343 --> 01:12:28,470
Put your hands on the dash."

1104
01:12:28,512 --> 01:12:31,557
He's still looking at me,
nodding his head.

1105
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,976
"I know, buddy, I know."

1106
01:12:34,018 --> 01:12:37,772
Meanwhile his hand is still
going for the glove box.

1107
01:12:37,856 --> 01:12:39,482
And I said...

1108
01:12:39,566 --> 01:12:43,445
"Buddy, I'm gonna shoot you
in the face...

1109
01:12:43,529 --> 01:12:46,240
if you don't put your hands up."

1110
01:12:47,701 --> 01:12:51,830
Then this guy's girlfriend,
this real sexy Oriental bitch...

1111
01:12:51,873 --> 01:12:55,168
she starts screaming at him:
"Chuck, what are you doin'?

1112
01:12:55,210 --> 01:12:58,505
Listen to the officer!
Put your hands on the dash!"

1113
01:12:58,547 --> 01:13:02,802
So then the guy snaps out of it
and puts his hands on the dash.

1114
01:13:02,886 --> 01:13:04,262
What was he goin' for?

1115
01:13:04,346 --> 01:13:06,598
His fucking registration.

1116
01:13:07,933 --> 01:13:09,518
- You're kidding.
- No, man!

1117
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,189
Stupid citizen doesn't know how close
he came to gettin' blown away.

1118
01:13:13,273 --> 01:13:14,733
That close, man.

1119
01:13:48,314 --> 01:13:50,274
You knew how to handle
that situation.

1120
01:13:50,317 --> 01:13:53,278
You shit your pants,
dive in and swim.

1121
01:13:55,865 --> 01:13:57,867
Tell me more about Cabot.

1122
01:13:57,951 --> 01:13:59,786
I don't know.

1123
01:13:59,828 --> 01:14:01,830
He's a cool guy.

1124
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:06,210
He's funny.
He's a funny guy.

1125
01:14:06,961 --> 01:14:09,171
You remember
the Fantastic Four?

1126
01:14:10,257 --> 01:14:12,175
Yeah, with that invisible bitch...

1127
01:14:12,259 --> 01:14:14,177
and "Flame on"
and shit, right?

1128
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:16,639
Thing.

1129
01:14:17,307 --> 01:14:18,558
Motherfucker...

1130
01:14:18,642 --> 01:14:20,602
Iooks just like the Thing.

1131
01:14:24,858 --> 01:14:27,444
Hey! Showtime!

1132
01:14:27,486 --> 01:14:30,406
Grab your jacket.
I'm parked outside.

1133
01:14:30,489 --> 01:14:32,324
I'll be right down.

1134
01:14:33,826 --> 01:14:35,077
He'll be right down.

1135
01:15:55,089 --> 01:15:57,216
Don't pussy out on me now.

1136
01:15:57,258 --> 01:15:59,218
They don't know.

1137
01:15:59,261 --> 01:16:01,513
They don't know shit.

1138
01:16:01,597 --> 01:16:04,725
You're not gonna get hurt.
You're fuckin' Baretta.

1139
01:16:04,767 --> 01:16:08,229
They believe every fuckin' word
'cause you're super cool.

1140
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:17,073
There goes our boy.

1141
01:16:17,115 --> 01:16:20,243
The guy has to have rocks in his head
the size of Gibraltar...

1142
01:16:20,327 --> 01:16:21,787
to work undercover.

1143
01:16:21,829 --> 01:16:24,790
- You want one of these?
- Yeah, give me the bear claw.

1144
01:16:40,851 --> 01:16:42,811
I know what I'm talking about.

1145
01:16:42,854 --> 01:16:45,523
Black women ain't the same
as white women.

1146
01:16:45,607 --> 01:16:47,025
There's a slight difference.

1147
01:16:47,109 --> 01:16:49,862
Very funny.
You know what I mean.

1148
01:16:49,946 --> 01:16:53,408
What a white bitch will put up with,
a black bitch wouldn't for a minute.

1149
01:16:53,491 --> 01:16:56,327
If you cross their line,
they fuck you up.

1150
01:16:56,412 --> 01:16:58,956
I gotta go along with Pink
on that.

1151
01:16:58,998 --> 01:17:01,792
Okay, Mr. Expert,
if this is such a truism...

1152
01:17:01,835 --> 01:17:06,298
why is it that every nigger I know
treats his woman like a piece of shit?

1153
01:17:06,382 --> 01:17:09,844
I'll bet those same niggers
who show their ass in public...

1154
01:17:09,928 --> 01:17:12,848
when their bitches get 'em home
they chill the fuck out.

1155
01:17:12,931 --> 01:17:16,017
- Not these guys.
- Oh, yeah. Those guys too.

1156
01:17:16,101 --> 01:17:18,145
Tell you guys a story.

1157
01:17:18,187 --> 01:17:23,026
In one of Daddy's clubs there's
a black cocktail waitress named Elois.

1158
01:17:23,068 --> 01:17:25,112
- Elois?
- Yeah, Elois.

1159
01:17:25,196 --> 01:17:28,741
E and Lois.
We called her Lady E.

1160
01:17:28,825 --> 01:17:30,743
Where was she from?
Compton?

1161
01:17:32,871 --> 01:17:34,289
She's from Ladora Heights.

1162
01:17:34,373 --> 01:17:36,792
Ladora Heights.
The black Beverly Hills.

1163
01:17:37,877 --> 01:17:40,171
It's not
the black Beverly Hills.

1164
01:17:40,213 --> 01:17:42,799
It's the black Palos Verdes.

1165
01:17:42,883 --> 01:17:44,718
Anyway...

1166
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:49,181
Lady E, she was a man-eater-upper.
Un-fuckin'-believable.

1167
01:17:49,224 --> 01:17:54,063
Every guy who ever saw her
had to jack off to her at least once.

1168
01:17:54,105 --> 01:17:57,066
You know who she looked like?
Christie Love.

1169
01:17:57,150 --> 01:17:59,068
Remember that TV show
Get Christie Love...

1170
01:17:59,152 --> 01:18:01,446
about the black female cop?

1171
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:04,450
She always used to say,
"You're under arrest, sugar! "

1172
01:18:06,578 --> 01:18:09,414
- Who played Christie Love?
- Pam Grier.

1173
01:18:09,456 --> 01:18:12,417
No, it wasn't Pam Grier.
Pam Grier was the other one.

1174
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:14,420
Pam Grier did the film.

1175
01:18:14,462 --> 01:18:19,134
Christie Love was like
a Pam Grier TV show without Pam Grier.

1176
01:18:19,218 --> 01:18:22,430
- So, who was Christie Love?
- How should I know?

1177
01:18:22,472 --> 01:18:24,432
Great. Now I'm totally
fuckin' tortured.

1178
01:18:24,474 --> 01:18:27,769
Whoever it was,
she looked exactly like Elois.

1179
01:18:27,853 --> 01:18:29,271
Anne Francis.

1180
01:18:29,355 --> 01:18:32,024
No. That was Honey West.

1181
01:18:32,108 --> 01:18:33,860
Anne Francis is white.

1182
01:18:33,943 --> 01:18:38,198
I'm tryin' to tell a story here.
She looked exactly like Elois.

1183
01:18:38,282 --> 01:18:40,826
We come into the club
one night...

1184
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:42,828
and there's Carlos,
the bartender.

1185
01:18:42,912 --> 01:18:46,082
He's a wetback.
He's a friend of mine.

1186
01:18:46,124 --> 01:18:48,793
I says to him,
"Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?"

1187
01:18:49,879 --> 01:18:51,881
Apparently Lady E...

1188
01:18:51,965 --> 01:18:55,260
was married to real piece
of dog shit, a real animal.

1189
01:18:55,302 --> 01:18:57,554
He used to do things to her.

1190
01:18:57,638 --> 01:18:59,598
Like what?
What would he do?

1191
01:18:59,682 --> 01:19:01,392
Beat her up?

1192
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:04,312
I don't know.
He just did things.

1193
01:19:04,354 --> 01:19:08,066
So anyway, one night
she plays it real cool.

1194
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:10,486
She waits for him to get drunk.

1195
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:13,490
He falls asleep
on the fuckin' couch.

1196
01:19:13,532 --> 01:19:17,870
She sneaks up on him,
puts some glue on his dick...

1197
01:19:17,954 --> 01:19:20,123
and glues his dick
to his belly.

1198
01:19:21,249 --> 01:19:23,001
Jesus Christ!

1199
01:19:23,085 --> 01:19:25,879
I'm serious, man.
I'm dead serious.

1200
01:19:25,963 --> 01:19:29,258
They had to call the paramedics
to cut the prick loose.

1201
01:19:30,594 --> 01:19:32,512
Was he all pissed off?

1202
01:19:34,557 --> 01:19:38,812
How would you feel if you had to do
a fuckin' handstand to take a piss?

1203
01:19:43,108 --> 01:19:47,029
You guys like to tell jokes
and giggle and kid around, huh?

1204
01:19:47,113 --> 01:19:50,033
Giggling like a bunch of girls
in the schoolyard.

1205
01:19:50,075 --> 01:19:52,035
Well, let me tell a joke.

1206
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:55,790
Five guys
sittin' in a bullpen...

1207
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:57,709
San Quentin...

1208
01:19:57,792 --> 01:20:00,712
wonderin' how the fuck
they got there.

1209
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:04,133
"What did we do wrong?
What shouldn't we have done?

1210
01:20:04,217 --> 01:20:06,135
It's your fault, his fault--"

1211
01:20:06,219 --> 01:20:07,971
All that bullshit.

1212
01:20:08,055 --> 01:20:09,807
Finally somebody says...

1213
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:12,100
"Wait a minute.

1214
01:20:12,184 --> 01:20:14,186
While we were
planning this caper...

1215
01:20:14,229 --> 01:20:16,773
we just sat around
tellin' fuckin' jokes."

1216
01:20:16,857 --> 01:20:18,567
Got the message?

1217
01:20:20,861 --> 01:20:22,779
I don't mean to holler at ya.

1218
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,410
When this caper's over,
and I'm sure it'll be successful...

1219
01:20:27,494 --> 01:20:30,872
we'll go down to Hawaiian lslands,
I'll laugh with all of youse.

1220
01:20:30,915 --> 01:20:33,000
Find me a different character
down there.

1221
01:20:33,084 --> 01:20:35,420
Right now it's a matter
of business.

1222
01:20:36,588 --> 01:20:39,007
With the exception
of Eddie and myself...

1223
01:20:39,091 --> 01:20:40,843
who you already know...

1224
01:20:40,927 --> 01:20:43,763
we're gonna be using aliases
on this job.

1225
01:20:43,805 --> 01:20:46,307
Under no circumstances...

1226
01:20:46,392 --> 01:20:49,562
do we want any one of you
to relate to each other...

1227
01:20:49,604 --> 01:20:51,856
by your Christian names.

1228
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:56,320
And I don't want any talk
about yourself personally.

1229
01:20:56,403 --> 01:21:00,282
That includes where you been,
your wife's name...

1230
01:21:00,366 --> 01:21:02,284
where you might've done time...

1231
01:21:02,369 --> 01:21:06,206
or a bank maybe you robbed
in St. Petersburg.

1232
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:10,211
All I want you guys to talk about,
if you have to...

1233
01:21:10,295 --> 01:21:12,881
is what you're gonna do.

1234
01:21:12,965 --> 01:21:15,134
That should do it.

1235
01:21:15,217 --> 01:21:17,636
These are your names--

1236
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:20,640
Mr. Brown, Mr. White...

1237
01:21:20,682 --> 01:21:23,143
Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue...

1238
01:21:23,227 --> 01:21:25,396
Mr. Orange and Mr. Pink.

1239
01:21:25,479 --> 01:21:29,108
- Why am I Mr. Pink?
- Because you're a faggot! All right?

1240
01:21:30,944 --> 01:21:33,363
- Why can't we pick our own colors?
- No way.

1241
01:21:33,447 --> 01:21:36,116
No way. Tried it once.
It doesn't work.

1242
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:39,621
You get four guys all fightin'
over who gets to be Mr. Black.

1243
01:21:39,663 --> 01:21:43,083
They don't know each other,
so nobody wants to back down.

1244
01:21:43,167 --> 01:21:45,503
No way. I pick.
You're Mr. Pink.

1245
01:21:45,586 --> 01:21:47,713
Be thankful
you're not Mr. Yellow.

1246
01:21:48,882 --> 01:21:51,176
But Mr. Brown,
that's too close to Mr. Shit.

1247
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:53,178
Mr. Pink
sounds like Mr. Pussy.

1248
01:21:53,262 --> 01:21:55,139
How about Mr. Purple?

1249
01:21:55,181 --> 01:21:57,183
That's sounds good.
I'll be Mr. Purple.

1250
01:21:57,267 --> 01:21:59,686
You're not Mr. Purple.

1251
01:21:59,770 --> 01:22:04,025
Some guy on some other job
is Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink!

1252
01:22:04,108 --> 01:22:05,860
Who cares what your name is?

1253
01:22:05,944 --> 01:22:09,573
Easy for you to say. You're Mr. White.
You have a cool-sounding name.

1254
01:22:09,657 --> 01:22:13,369
If it's no big deal to be Mr. Pink,
you wanna trade?

1255
01:22:13,411 --> 01:22:16,205
Nobody's tradin' with anybody.

1256
01:22:16,248 --> 01:22:19,418
This ain't a goddamn fuckin'
city council meeting, you know.

1257
01:22:21,254 --> 01:22:23,214
Now listen up, Mr. Pink.

1258
01:22:23,298 --> 01:22:25,842
There's two ways you can go
on this job--

1259
01:22:25,884 --> 01:22:28,178
my way or the highway.

1260
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:30,305
What's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?

1261
01:22:31,057 --> 01:22:34,018
Jesus Christ, Joe.
Fuckin' forget about it.

1262
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:36,729
It's beneath me.
I'm Mr. Pink. Let's move on.

1263
01:22:36,814 --> 01:22:39,734
I'll move on
when I feel like it.

1264
01:22:39,817 --> 01:22:42,737
Do all you guys
got the goddamn message?

1265
01:22:44,406 --> 01:22:48,369
I'm so goddamn mad hollerin'
at you guys, I can hardly talk.

1266
01:22:49,746 --> 01:22:51,831
Let's go to work.

1267
01:22:51,915 --> 01:22:54,751
Let's go over it.
Where are you?

1268
01:22:54,793 --> 01:22:58,380
I stand outside and guard the door.
I don't let anybody go in or out.

1269
01:22:59,132 --> 01:23:01,301
- Mr. Brown.
- He waits in the car.

1270
01:23:01,384 --> 01:23:04,888
I give him the signal,
he pulls up in front.

1271
01:23:04,972 --> 01:23:07,182
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue.

1272
01:23:07,266 --> 01:23:10,895
Crowd control. They handle
the customers and the employees.

1273
01:23:10,937 --> 01:23:14,149
- That girl's ass.
- Sittin' right here on my dick.

1274
01:23:16,652 --> 01:23:18,612
Myself and Mr. Pink?

1275
01:23:18,696 --> 01:23:22,825
You two take the manager
and make him give you the diamonds.

1276
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:25,037
We're there
for those stones, period.

1277
01:23:25,121 --> 01:23:28,583
Since no display cases are being
fucked with, no alarms should go off.

1278
01:23:29,835 --> 01:23:32,796
We're out in two minutes,
not one second longer.

1279
01:23:34,006 --> 01:23:36,967
What if the manager
won't give you the diamonds?

1280
01:23:38,053 --> 01:23:41,515
A store like this
is insured up the ass.

1281
01:23:41,599 --> 01:23:44,519
They're not supposed to give you
any resistance whatsoever.

1282
01:23:44,602 --> 01:23:48,356
If you get a customer or an employee
who thinks he's Charles Bronson...

1283
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,817
smash their nose with your gun.

1284
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:53,361
Drops him right to the floor.
Everyone jumps.

1285
01:23:53,446 --> 01:23:56,366
He falls down screaming,
blood squirts out of his nose.

1286
01:23:56,449 --> 01:23:59,369
Freaks everybody out.
Nobody says fuckin' shit after that.

1287
01:24:00,538 --> 01:24:02,999
Some bitch might
talk shit to you.

1288
01:24:03,041 --> 01:24:07,004
Give her a look like she's next.
Watch her shut the fuck up.

1289
01:24:08,172 --> 01:24:10,841
If it's the manager,
that's different.

1290
01:24:10,925 --> 01:24:13,177
The managers know not
to fuck around...

1291
01:24:13,261 --> 01:24:15,555
so if he's giving you static...

1292
01:24:15,639 --> 01:24:19,852
he probably thinks he's a real cowboy
so you gotta that bastard in two.

1293
01:24:19,894 --> 01:24:23,857
If he won't tell ya something,
cut off one of his fingers.

1294
01:24:23,898 --> 01:24:27,193
The little one.
Then tell him his thumb's next.

1295
01:24:27,236 --> 01:24:30,197
After that he'll tell you
if he wears ladies underwear.

1296
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:36,162
I'm hungry.
Let's get a taco.

1297
01:24:51,806 --> 01:24:52,723
Fuck.

1298
01:25:11,330 --> 01:25:12,998
Jesus.

1299
01:25:13,082 --> 01:25:15,292
I'm blind, man.
I'm fuckin' blind.

1300
01:25:15,376 --> 01:25:17,795
No, you just got
blood in your eyes.

1301
01:25:30,978 --> 01:25:32,312
Is he dead?

1302
01:25:33,689 --> 01:25:35,607
Did he die or not?

1303
01:25:36,818 --> 01:25:38,278
Let's go.

1304
01:26:12,902 --> 01:26:15,238
Hold it! Get out!

1305
01:26:16,865 --> 01:26:18,825
Get out of the fuckin' car!

1306
01:26:34,344 --> 01:26:36,513
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Larry.

1307
01:26:37,598 --> 01:26:39,516
I can't believe she killed me.

1308
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,143
Who'd have fucking thought that?

1309
01:26:41,186 --> 01:26:43,855
Hey, just cancel that shit
right now.

1310
01:26:43,939 --> 01:26:46,859
You're hurt.
You're hurt real fuckin' bad.

1311
01:26:46,942 --> 01:26:48,694
But you ain't dying.

1312
01:26:49,988 --> 01:26:52,908
All this blood's scaring
the shit out of me, Larry.

1313
01:26:54,201 --> 01:26:56,161
I'm gonna die.
I know it.

1314
01:27:31,245 --> 01:27:32,705
What the fuck happened?

1315
01:27:32,788 --> 01:27:36,751
He slashed the cop's face, cut off
his ear and was gonna burn him alive.

1316
01:27:38,045 --> 01:27:40,255
What? I didn't hear you.

1317
01:27:40,339 --> 01:27:41,757
I said...

1318
01:27:43,593 --> 01:27:45,178
Blonde went crazy.

1319
01:27:45,261 --> 01:27:50,517
He slashed the cop's face, cut off
his ear and was gonna burn him alive.

1320
01:27:50,601 --> 01:27:51,852
This cop?

1321
01:27:56,942 --> 01:27:58,986
He went crazy?
Something like that?

1322
01:27:59,069 --> 01:28:01,154
Worse or better?

1323
01:28:01,239 --> 01:28:04,451
Eddie, he was
pulling a burn, man.

1324
01:28:05,702 --> 01:28:07,704
He was gonna kill
the cop and me.

1325
01:28:07,788 --> 01:28:11,625
When you guys walked in, he was gonna
kill you and run with the diamonds.

1326
01:28:12,293 --> 01:28:13,377
What'd I tell ya?

1327
01:28:13,461 --> 01:28:17,006
That sick piece of shit
was a stone-cold psycho.

1328
01:28:17,091 --> 01:28:20,303
You should've asked the cop,
not just killed him.

1329
01:28:20,386 --> 01:28:24,015
He talked about what he was gonna do
when he was slicing him up.

1330
01:28:25,559 --> 01:28:27,311
I don't buy it.

1331
01:28:27,353 --> 01:28:28,813
Doesn't make sense.

1332
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:35,571
Makes perfect fuckin' sense
to me.

1333
01:28:35,654 --> 01:28:39,199
You didn't see how he acted
during the job. We did.

1334
01:28:39,284 --> 01:28:41,453
He's right.
The ear's hacked off.

1335
01:28:41,536 --> 01:28:45,707
Let me just say this out loud,
'cause I wanna get this straight.

1336
01:28:46,667 --> 01:28:48,627
You're saying that Mr. Blonde...

1337
01:28:48,670 --> 01:28:49,838
was gonna kill you...

1338
01:28:49,921 --> 01:28:53,133
and then when we got back
he was gonna kill us...

1339
01:28:53,175 --> 01:28:55,135
take the diamonds and scram.

1340
01:28:55,177 --> 01:28:58,389
I'm right about that, right?
That's your story?

1341
01:28:59,057 --> 01:29:01,017
I swear on my mother's soul...

1342
01:29:01,059 --> 01:29:02,685
that's what happened.

1343
01:29:03,687 --> 01:29:06,648
The man you killed
just got released from prison.

1344
01:29:06,733 --> 01:29:09,819
He got caught at a company warehouse
full of hot items.

1345
01:29:09,861 --> 01:29:12,489
He could've fuckin' walked.

1346
01:29:12,573 --> 01:29:16,744
All he had to do was say my dad's name,
but he didn't; he kept his mouth shut.

1347
01:29:16,828 --> 01:29:19,914
He did his fuckin' time
like a man.

1348
01:29:19,998 --> 01:29:22,250
He did four years for us.

1349
01:29:22,334 --> 01:29:24,753
So, Mr. Orange...

1350
01:29:24,837 --> 01:29:27,840
you're telling me
that this good friend of mine...

1351
01:29:27,883 --> 01:29:30,719
who did four years
for my father...

1352
01:29:30,803 --> 01:29:35,725
who, in four years, never made a deal,
no matter what they offered him...

1353
01:29:35,767 --> 01:29:38,853
you're telling me that
now that he's free...

1354
01:29:38,896 --> 01:29:41,857
and we're making good
on our commitment to him...

1355
01:29:41,899 --> 01:29:46,571
he's just gonna decide,
out of the fucking blue...

1356
01:29:46,655 --> 01:29:48,573
to rip us off?

1357
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:53,621
Why don't you tell me
what really happened.

1358
01:29:53,705 --> 01:29:55,373
What the hell for?

1359
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,418
It'd just be more bullshit.

1360
01:30:00,588 --> 01:30:02,548
This man set us up.

1361
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:06,845
Dad, I'm sorry,
but I don't know what's happening.

1362
01:30:06,929 --> 01:30:10,683
- It's all right. I do.
- What are you talking about?

1363
01:30:10,767 --> 01:30:14,438
That lump of shit's workin'
with the L.A.P.D.

1364
01:30:15,772 --> 01:30:19,109
I don't have the slightest
fucking idea...

1365
01:30:19,193 --> 01:30:20,611
what you're talking about.

1366
01:30:20,695 --> 01:30:24,240
Joe, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.

1367
01:30:24,324 --> 01:30:26,117
Like hell I am.

1368
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:29,288
Trust me on this.
You've made a mistake.

1369
01:30:29,372 --> 01:30:31,082
He's a good kid.

1370
01:30:31,124 --> 01:30:33,710
I understand
you're super-fuckin'-pissed.

1371
01:30:33,794 --> 01:30:35,546
We're all real emotional.

1372
01:30:35,629 --> 01:30:39,842
But you're barking up the wrong tree.
I know him. He wouldn't do that.

1373
01:30:39,926 --> 01:30:41,469
You don't know jack shit!

1374
01:30:41,553 --> 01:30:42,721
I do.

1375
01:30:42,804 --> 01:30:44,722
The cocksucker
tipped off the cops...

1376
01:30:44,807 --> 01:30:46,934
and got Mr. Brown
and Mr. Blue killed.

1377
01:30:47,018 --> 01:30:49,979
- Mr. Blue is dead?
- Dead as Dillinger.

1378
01:30:50,063 --> 01:30:52,065
How do you know all this?

1379
01:30:52,149 --> 01:30:55,569
He was the only one
I wasn't 100 percent on.

1380
01:30:55,653 --> 01:30:58,906
I should have my head examined,
going ahead when I wasn't 100 percent.

1381
01:30:58,990 --> 01:31:02,744
- That's your proof?
- With instinct, you don't need proof.

1382
01:31:02,828 --> 01:31:05,164
I ignored it before,
but no more.

1383
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,836
Have you lost your fuckin' mind?

1384
01:31:09,878 --> 01:31:12,714
I'm not gonna let you make
a terrible mistake.

1385
01:31:12,798 --> 01:31:15,718
Come on, guys.
Nobody wants this.

1386
01:31:15,802 --> 01:31:17,720
We're supposed to be
fuckin' professionals.

1387
01:31:18,597 --> 01:31:20,474
Larry, look...

1388
01:31:20,516 --> 01:31:22,518
it's been quite a long time.

1389
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,020
A lot of jobs.

1390
01:31:24,061 --> 01:31:27,106
There's no need for this, man.

1391
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:29,609
Let's just put our guns down...

1392
01:31:30,778 --> 01:31:32,488
and let's settle this...

1393
01:31:32,530 --> 01:31:34,198
with a fucking conversation.

1394
01:31:34,282 --> 01:31:37,744
Joe, if you kill that man,
you die next.

1395
01:31:37,828 --> 01:31:39,997
Repeat: you kill him,
you die next.

1396
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:43,375
Larry, we have been friends.

1397
01:31:43,459 --> 01:31:45,628
You respect my dad
and I respect you...

1398
01:31:45,712 --> 01:31:47,630
but I'll put bullets
in you.

1399
01:31:47,714 --> 01:31:49,966
You put that fuckin' gun
down now.

1400
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:53,054
Goddamn you, Joe...

1401
01:31:53,138 --> 01:31:54,556
don't make me do this.

1402
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:57,267
Larry, you stop pointin' that gun
at my dad!

1403
01:33:44,102 --> 01:33:46,020
I'm sorry, kid.

1404
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:50,358
Looks like we're gonna...

1405
01:33:51,694 --> 01:33:53,654
do a little time.

1406
01:34:00,163 --> 01:34:02,081
I'm a cop.

1407
01:34:03,875 --> 01:34:05,835
Larry...

1408
01:34:07,087 --> 01:34:09,047
I'm sorry.

1409
01:34:10,216 --> 01:34:12,009
I'm...

1410
01:34:12,052 --> 01:34:14,179
so sorry.

1411
01:34:17,058 --> 01:34:19,519
I'm a cop.

1412
01:34:36,581 --> 01:34:38,041
I'm sorry.

1413
01:34:49,763 --> 01:34:51,223
I'm sorry.

1414
01:34:52,808 --> 01:34:54,476
I'm...

1415
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:55,811
sorr--

1416
01:34:58,565 --> 01:34:59,649
Freeze!

1417
01:34:59,733 --> 01:35:01,735
Drop the fucking gun, buddy!

1418
01:35:01,777 --> 01:35:03,737
- Now!
- Put the gun down!

1419
01:35:03,779 --> 01:35:06,615
- Don't do it!
- Drop the gun, man!

1420
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:09,953
- Drop the fucking gun!
- We're gonna blow you away!
