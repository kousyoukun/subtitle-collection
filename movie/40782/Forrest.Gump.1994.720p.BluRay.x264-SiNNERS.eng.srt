00:03:13,143 --> 00:03:17,706
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hello. My name's Forrest - Forrest Gump.

2
00:03:23,656 --> 00:03:25,590
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Do you want a chocolate?

3
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:32,599
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I could eat about a million
and a half of these.

4
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:34,601
{\fnTahoma\fs13}My mama always said

5
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,401
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Life was like
a box of chocolates.

6
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:42,603
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You never know what
you're going to get.

7
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,956
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Those must be
comfortable shoes.

8
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:56,392
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that

9
00:03:56,463 --> 00:03:58,397
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and not feel a thing.

10
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:04,071
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I wish I had shoes like that.

11
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:06,573
{\fnTahoma\fs13}My feet hurt.

12
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:08,576
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mama always said
there's an awful lot

13
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:12,581
{\fnTahoma\fs13}you can tell about
a person by their shoes.

14
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,584
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Where they're going,

15
00:04:14,652 --> 00:04:16,119
{\fnTahoma\fs13}where they've been.

16
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,722
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I've worn lots of shoes.

17
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,603
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I bet if I think
about it real hard

18
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:33,106
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I could remember
my first pair of shoes.

19
00:04:35,845 --> 00:04:38,907
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mama said they'd
take me anywhere.

20
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:42,067
{\fnTahoma\fs13}She said they was my magic shoes.

21
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:45,581
{\fnTahoma\fs13}All right, Forrest,
Open your eyes now.

22
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:53,954
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Let's take a little walk around.

23
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,194
{\fnTahoma\fs13}How do those feel?

24
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:08,907
{\fnTahoma\fs13}His legs are strong,
Mrs. Gump,

25
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:11,412
{\fnTahoma\fs13}as strong as I've ever seen.

26
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:15,542
{\fnTahoma\fs13}But his back's as
crooked as a politician.

27
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,987
{\fnTahoma\fs13}But we're going to straighten him
right up, aren't we, Forrest?

28
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:20,320
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest!

29
00:05:20,392 --> 00:05:23,054
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now, when I was a baby,

30
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:25,893
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero

31
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:26,967
{\fnTahoma\fs13}General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

32
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:28,059
{\fnTahoma\fs13}General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

33
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:31,571
{\fnTahoma\fs13}She said we was related
to him in some way.

34
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,073
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What he did was,

35
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:36,577
{\fnTahoma\fs13}he tarted up this club
called the Ku Klux Klan.

36
00:05:36,646 --> 00:05:40,082
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bed sheets

37
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,588
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and act like a bunch
of ghosts or spooks or something.

38
00:05:44,656 --> 00:05:48,592
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.

39
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:52,722
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And, anyway, that'show
I got my name... Forrest Gump.

40
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:56,132
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mama said the Forrest part
was to remind me

41
00:05:56,203 --> 00:05:59,138
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that sometimes we all
do things that, well,

42
00:05:59,207 --> 00:06:01,641
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that just don't make no sense.

43
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:13,540
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This way. Hold on. Ugh!

44
00:06:13,609 --> 00:06:15,770
{\fnTahoma\fs13}All right.

45
00:06:15,845 --> 00:06:17,779
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What are y'all staring at?

46
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:19,281
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Haven't you ever seen

47
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:22,341
{\fnTahoma\fs13}a little boy with braces
on his legs before?

48
00:06:23,588 --> 00:06:25,021
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Don't ever let anybody

49
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:27,523
{\fnTahoma\fs13}tell you they're better
than you, Forrest.

50
00:06:27,593 --> 00:06:30,027
{\fnTahoma\fs13}If God intended everybody
to be the same,

51
00:06:30,096 --> 00:06:33,031
{\fnTahoma\fs13}he'd have given us all
braces on our legs.

52
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:37,035
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.

53
00:06:37,238 --> 00:06:41,573
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,

54
00:06:41,643 --> 00:06:44,578
{\fnTahoma\fs13}about a half mile from the town
of Greenbow, Alabama.

55
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:47,582
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That's in the county
of Greenbow.

56
00:06:47,651 --> 00:06:50,085
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Our house had been
in Mama's family

57
00:06:50,154 --> 00:06:52,213
{\fnTahoma\fs13}since her grandpa's
grandpa's grandpa

58
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,726
{\fnTahoma\fs13}had come across the ocean
about a thousand years ago.

59
00:06:55,795 --> 00:06:58,161
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Since it was just me and Mama

60
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,164
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and we had all these empty rooms,

61
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:02,667
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mama decided to let those rooms out,

62
00:07:02,736 --> 00:07:04,169
{\fnTahoma\fs13}mostly to people passing through,

63
00:07:04,238 --> 00:07:07,833
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.

64
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,845
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That's how me and Mama got money.

65
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:13,677
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mama was a real smart lady.

66
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,684
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Remember what I told you, Forrest.

67
00:07:15,752 --> 00:07:18,778
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You're no different
than anybody else is.

68
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:23,526
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Did you hear
what I said, Forrest?

69
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:26,029
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You're the same
as everybody else.

70
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:28,032
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You are no different.

71
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,765
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Your boy's... different,
Mrs. Gump.

72
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:35,275
{\fnTahoma\fs13}His I. Q is 75.

73
00:07:35,343 --> 00:07:37,868
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well, we're all different,

74
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:39,209
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mr. Hancock.

75
00:07:42,452 --> 00:07:44,886
{\fnTahoma\fs13}She wanted me to have
the finest education

76
00:07:44,955 --> 00:07:48,391
{\fnTahoma\fs13}so she to ok me to
the Greenbow County Central School.

77
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:51,394
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I met the principal and all.

78
00:07:51,463 --> 00:07:54,728
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump.

79
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:57,201
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now, this is normal.

80
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:02,265
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest is right here.

81
00:08:02,344 --> 00:08:05,177
{\fnTahoma\fs13}The state require s
a minimum I. Q of 80

82
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:06,976
{\fnTahoma\fs13}to attend public school.

83
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:08,346
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mrs. Gump,

84
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:11,318
{\fnTahoma\fs13}he's going to have to
go to a special school.

85
00:08:11,388 --> 00:08:13,822
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now, he'll be just fine.

86
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:16,325
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What does normal mean anyway?

87
00:08:16,394 --> 00:08:18,328
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He might be...

88
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:20,523
{\fnTahoma\fs13}a bit on the slow side,

89
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,032
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but my boy Forrest

90
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:25,036
{\fnTahoma\fs13}is going to get the same
opportunities as everyone else.

91
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,198
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He's not going to
some special school

92
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:29,209
{\fnTahoma\fs13}to learn how to retread tires.

93
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:32,269
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We're talking about
five little points here.

94
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:37,017
{\fnTahoma\fs13}There must be something
can be done.

95
00:08:37,086 --> 00:08:41,547
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We're a progressive
school system.

96
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,389
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We don't want to see
anybody left behind.

97
00:08:44,462 --> 00:08:49,230
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

98
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,982
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He's on vacation.

99
00:09:11,036 --> 00:09:14,972
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

100
00:09:20,547 --> 00:09:23,175
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You don't say much, do you?

101
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:36,773
{\fnTahoma\fs13}"Finally, he had to try.

102
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:39,782
{\fnTahoma\fs13}"It looked easy, but...

103
00:09:39,851 --> 00:09:42,445
{\fnTahoma\fs13}oh, what happened.
First they..."

104
00:09:42,521 --> 00:09:45,786
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mama, what's vacation mean?

105
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:47,120
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Vacation?

106
00:09:47,194 --> 00:09:48,957
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Where Daddy went?

107
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:53,629
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Vacation's when
you go somewhere...

108
00:09:56,038 --> 00:09:58,302
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and you don't ever come back.

109
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:04,313
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Anyway, I guess you could say

110
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:06,942
{\fnTahoma\fs13}me and Mama was on our own.

111
00:10:07,017 --> 00:10:08,985
{\fnTahoma\fs13}But we didn't mind.

112
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:11,488
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Our house was never empty.

113
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:14,492
{\fnTahoma\fs13}There was always folks
coming and going.

114
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,652
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Supper!

115
00:10:15,729 --> 00:10:17,162
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's supper, everyone!

116
00:10:17,231 --> 00:10:18,755
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That sure looks special.

117
00:10:18,832 --> 00:10:21,665
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Sometimes, we had
so many people staying with us

118
00:10:21,736 --> 00:10:25,172
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that every room was filled,
with travelers, you know,

119
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:27,675
{\fnTahoma\fs13}folks living
out of their suitcases

120
00:10:27,743 --> 00:10:31,179
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and hat cases
and sample cases.

121
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:34,945
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest Gump,
it's suppertime! Forrest?

122
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:37,852
{\fnTahoma\fs13}One time, a young man
was staying with us,

123
00:10:37,923 --> 00:10:41,017
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and he had him a guitar case.

124
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:49,365
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Well, you ain't
never caught a rabbit #

125
00:10:49,438 --> 00:10:51,030
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# And you ain't no #

126
00:10:51,106 --> 00:10:52,630
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Friend of mine #

127
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,102
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest,

128
00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:58,943
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

129
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:00,449
{\fnTahoma\fs13}No, that's all right, ma'am.

130
00:11:00,517 --> 00:11:03,953
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I was showing him
a thing or two on the guitar.

131
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:06,957
{\fnTahoma\fs13}All right. Supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

132
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:09,961
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

133
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:13,465
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you did there.

134
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:14,966
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Slow it down some.

135
00:11:15,036 --> 00:11:17,504
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# You ain't nothing but... #

136
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:19,870
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I liked that guitar.

137
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:22,536
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It sounded good.

138
00:11:22,612 --> 00:11:27,846
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I started moving around
to the music,

139
00:11:27,918 --> 00:11:29,852
{\fnTahoma\fs13}swinging my hips.

140
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,013
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Cryin' all the time #

141
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,580
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This one night,

142
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:35,592
{\fnTahoma\fs13}me and Mama was out shopping,

143
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,095
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and we walked by Vincy's
Furniture and Appliance Store,

144
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,153
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and guess what?

145
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:45,639
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog #

146
00:11:45,707 --> 00:11:48,767
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Cryin' all the time #

147
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:52,413
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog #

148
00:11:52,482 --> 00:11:55,383
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This is not for
children's eyes.

149
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:57,511
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Cryin' all the time #

150
00:11:57,588 --> 00:11:59,021
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Some years later,

151
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,025
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that handsome young man
who they called the King,

152
00:12:02,094 --> 00:12:04,995
{\fnTahoma\fs13}well, he sung too many songs.

153
00:12:05,064 --> 00:12:07,999
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Had him self a heart attack
or something.

154
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:11,059
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It must be hard being a king.

155
00:12:14,576 --> 00:12:17,010
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You know, it's funny how you
remember some things,

156
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:18,011
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but some things you can't.

157
00:12:18,214 --> 00:12:21,547
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You do your very best now, Forrest.

158
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:24,018
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I sure will, Mama.

159
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:27,614
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school

160
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:29,023
{\fnTahoma\fs13}very well.

161
00:12:32,097 --> 00:12:33,962
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Are you coming along?

162
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:37,526
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mama said not to be
taking rides from strangers.

163
00:12:37,604 --> 00:12:40,129
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This is the bus to school.

164
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:45,409
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm Forrest...
Forrest Gump.

165
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,277
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm Dorothy Harris.

166
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,784
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well, now we ain't
strangers anymore.

167
00:13:02,535 --> 00:13:05,231
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This seat's taken.

168
00:13:06,807 --> 00:13:08,104
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's taken.

169
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:18,110
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You can't sit here.

170
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,361
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You know, it's funny what
a young man recollects,

171
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,761
{\fnTahoma\fs13}'cause I don 't
remember being born.

172
00:13:26,832 --> 00:13:30,233
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

173
00:13:30,303 --> 00:13:31,736
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and I don't know

174
00:13:31,804 --> 00:13:34,238
{\fnTahoma\fs13}when I went on
my first outdoor picnic,

175
00:13:34,308 --> 00:13:35,741
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but I do remember

176
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:39,802
{\fnTahoma\fs13}the first time I heard
the sweetest voice

177
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:41,781
{\fnTahoma\fs13}in the wide world.

178
00:13:41,851 --> 00:13:44,786
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You can sit here
if you want.

179
00:13:47,124 --> 00:13:50,992
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.

180
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:53,656
{\fnTahoma\fs13}She was like an angel.

181
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:57,498
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well, are you going to
sit down or aren't you?

182
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,633
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What's wrong with your legs?

183
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:05,645
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Um, nothing at all, thank you.

184
00:14:05,713 --> 00:14:08,511
{\fnTahoma\fs13}My legs are just fine and dandy.

185
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,518
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I just sat next to her
on that bus

186
00:14:11,587 --> 00:14:14,522
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and had a conversation
all the way to school.

187
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:17,025
{\fnTahoma\fs13}My back's crooked
like a question mark.

188
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:19,722
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Next to Mama,
no one ever talked to me

189
00:14:19,798 --> 00:14:22,198
{\fnTahoma\fs13}or asked me questions.

190
00:14:22,267 --> 00:14:24,531
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Are you stupid or something?

191
00:14:24,603 --> 00:14:27,663
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mama says,
"Stupid is as stupid does."

192
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,733
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm Jenny.

193
00:14:30,811 --> 00:14:33,371
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm Forrest... Forrest Gump.

194
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:35,882
{\fnTahoma\fs13}From that day on,
we was always together.

195
00:14:35,951 --> 00:14:38,511
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny and me
was like peas and carrots.

196
00:14:41,624 --> 00:14:43,524
{\fnTahoma\fs13}She taught me how to climb.

197
00:14:43,594 --> 00:14:46,085
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Come on, Forrest,
you can do it.

198
00:14:46,163 --> 00:14:48,825
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I showed her how to dangle.

199
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,424
{\fnTahoma\fs13}"A good little..."

200
00:14:50,502 --> 00:14:52,936
{\fnTahoma\fs13}She helped me
learn how to read,

201
00:14:53,005 --> 00:14:56,099
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and I showed her how to swing.

202
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:59,678
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Sometimes, we'd just sitout

203
00:14:59,747 --> 00:15:02,045
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and wait for the stars.

204
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:04,585
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mama's going to worry about me.

205
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,554
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Just stay a little longer.

206
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:11,719
{\fnTahoma\fs13}For some reason,
Jenny didn 't never want to go home.

207
00:15:11,795 --> 00:15:14,559
{\fnTahoma\fs13}O.K., Jenny, I'll stay.

208
00:15:14,632 --> 00:15:18,933
{\fnTahoma\fs13}She was my most special friend.

209
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:22,904
{\fnTahoma\fs13}My only friend.

210
00:15:25,646 --> 00:15:27,580
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now, my mama always told me

211
00:15:27,648 --> 00:15:29,582
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that miracles happen every day

212
00:15:29,651 --> 00:15:31,585
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Some people don't think so,

213
00:15:31,653 --> 00:15:33,143
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but they do.

214
00:15:35,424 --> 00:15:37,517
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, dummy!

215
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:41,063
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Are you dumb,
or just plain stupid?

216
00:15:41,131 --> 00:15:42,894
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.

217
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:44,298
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Just run away, Forrest.

218
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,735
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run, Forrest!

219
00:15:46,806 --> 00:15:48,899
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run away! Hurry!

220
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:50,532
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Get the bikes!

221
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,407
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Let's get him! Come on!

222
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:54,276
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Look out, Gump!

223
00:15:54,347 --> 00:15:57,214
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We're going to get you!

224
00:15:57,285 --> 00:15:59,412
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run, Forrest, run!

225
00:15:59,488 --> 00:16:01,513
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run, Forrest!

226
00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:04,450
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Come back here, you!

227
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,043
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run, Forrest!

228
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,706
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run!

229
00:16:53,188 --> 00:16:55,918
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now, you wouldn't
believe if I told you...

230
00:16:56,992 --> 00:17:00,223
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but I could run
like the wind blows.

231
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:04,556
{\fnTahoma\fs13}From that day on,

232
00:17:04,635 --> 00:17:07,069
{\fnTahoma\fs13}if I was going somewhere,

233
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:09,504
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I was running.

234
00:17:42,348 --> 00:17:45,675
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That boy sure
is a running fool.

235
00:17:48,646 --> 00:17:50,580
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now, remember how I told you

236
00:17:50,648 --> 00:17:53,583
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that Jenny never seemed
to want to go home?

237
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:57,019
{\fnTahoma\fs13}She lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.

238
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,718
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Her mama had gone
to heaven when she was 5,

239
00:17:59,793 --> 00:18:04,231
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.

240
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:05,527
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny?

241
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:08,536
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He was a very loving man.

242
00:18:08,605 --> 00:18:12,769
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He was always kissing
and touching her and her sisters.

243
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:16,546
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And then this one time,

244
00:18:16,614 --> 00:18:19,549
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny wasn't on the bus
to go to school.

245
00:18:19,618 --> 00:18:22,052
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny, why didn't you
come to school today?

246
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:24,555
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Shh. Daddy's taking a nap.

247
00:18:24,624 --> 00:18:25,716
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny!

248
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:28,056
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Come on!

249
00:18:28,128 --> 00:18:31,063
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny, where'd you run to?

250
00:18:31,132 --> 00:18:33,657
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You better
get back here, girl!

251
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:37,802
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Where you at?

252
00:18:41,144 --> 00:18:42,577
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny!

253
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:44,512
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny, where you at?

254
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,286
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny!

255
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:50,287
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Pray with me, Forrest.

256
00:18:50,356 --> 00:18:51,789
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Pray with me.

257
00:18:51,858 --> 00:18:53,086
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny!

258
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:56,458
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

259
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,464
{\fnTahoma\fs13}far, far away from here.

260
00:18:58,532 --> 00:19:03,470
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far.

261
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:06,474
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mama always said
God is mysterious.

262
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:07,873
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny!

263
00:19:07,944 --> 00:19:10,879
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He didn 't turn Jenny
in to a bird that day.

264
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:12,710
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Instead,

265
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,718
{\fnTahoma\fs13}he had the police say

266
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:18,222
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny didn't have to stay
in that house no more.

267
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,724
{\fnTahoma\fs13}She was to live
with her grandma,

268
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:22,728
{\fnTahoma\fs13}just over on Creekmore Avenue,

269
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:26,789
{\fnTahoma\fs13}which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.

270
00:19:28,136 --> 00:19:29,262
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Some nights,

271
00:19:29,337 --> 00:19:31,271
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny'd sneak out

272
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:33,773
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and come on over to my house,

273
00:19:33,843 --> 00:19:36,277
{\fnTahoma\fs13}just'cause
she said she was scared.

274
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:39,338
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Scared of what,
I don 't know.

275
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,078
{\fnTahoma\fs13}But I think
it was her grandma's dog.

276
00:19:42,153 --> 00:19:45,088
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He was a mean dog.

277
00:19:45,157 --> 00:19:48,320
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Anyway, Jenny and me
was best friends

278
00:19:48,394 --> 00:19:49,884
{\fnTahoma\fs13}all the way up
through high school.

279
00:19:50,897 --> 00:19:52,330
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, stupid!

280
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,367
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Quit it!

281
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:55,868
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run, Forrest, run!

282
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:59,431
{\fnTahoma\fs13}didn't you hear me, stupid?

283
00:19:59,508 --> 00:20:00,440
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run, Forrest!

284
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:01,840
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Get in the truck!

285
00:20:01,911 --> 00:20:05,244
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Come on!
He's getting away! Move it!

286
00:20:05,315 --> 00:20:07,783
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run, Forrest! Run!

287
00:20:12,557 --> 00:20:14,752
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Move it! Move it!

288
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:16,658
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You better be runnin'!

289
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:32,874
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Whoo-hoo!
Go!

290
00:20:35,486 --> 00:20:37,977
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run, Forrest!

291
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,649
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now, it used to be

292
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:44,662
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I ran to get
where I was going.

293
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:48,064
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I never thought
it would take me anywhere.

294
00:21:16,704 --> 00:21:18,763
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Who in the hell is that?

295
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,638
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.

296
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,701
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Just a local idiot.

297
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:26,145
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And can you believe it?

298
00:21:26,216 --> 00:21:29,014
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I got to go to college, too.

299
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,159
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest, move it!

300
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,160
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run!

301
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,161
{\fnTahoma\fs13}O.K.!

302
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:39,323
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run!

303
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:42,231
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run, you stupid
son of a bitch! Run!

304
00:21:55,085 --> 00:21:57,986
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run, son of a bitch, run!
Go! Run!

305
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:02,887
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run! Run! Go!

306
00:22:14,275 --> 00:22:17,711
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He must be the stupidest
son of a bitch alive,

307
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:19,747
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but he sure is fast.

308
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:24,583
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now, maybe it's just me,

309
00:22:24,655 --> 00:22:27,715
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but college was
very confusing times.

310
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,392
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Federal troops,
enforcing a court order,

311
00:22:31,462 --> 00:22:33,726
{\fnTahoma\fs13}integrated the University
of Alabama today.

312
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:35,323
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Two Negroes were admitted,

313
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:37,335
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but only after
Governor George Wallace

314
00:22:37,404 --> 00:22:39,338
{\fnTahoma\fs13}had carried out
his symbolic threat

315
00:22:39,406 --> 00:22:41,840
{\fnTahoma\fs13}to stand in the school house door.

316
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:44,673
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I take it from that statement...

317
00:22:44,746 --> 00:22:46,680
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Earl, what's going on?

318
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:49,182
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Coons are trying
to get into school.

319
00:22:49,252 --> 00:22:52,187
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Coons? When raccoons tried
getting on our back porch,

320
00:22:52,255 --> 00:22:54,689
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mama just chased them off
with a broom.

321
00:22:54,758 --> 00:22:56,623
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Not raccoons, you idiot. Niggers.

322
00:22:56,694 --> 00:22:59,629
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And they want to go
to school with us.

323
00:22:59,698 --> 00:23:01,632
{\fnTahoma\fs13}With us? They do?

324
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:03,635
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Shortly after Govern or Wallace

325
00:23:03,703 --> 00:23:06,638
{\fnTahoma\fs13}had carried out his promise
to block the door way,

326
00:23:06,707 --> 00:23:09,767
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Kennedy ordered these cretary
of defense to use military force.

327
00:23:09,844 --> 00:23:12,176
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Here, by video tape,
is the encounter

328
00:23:12,246 --> 00:23:14,680
{\fnTahoma\fs13}by General Graham, commander
of the National Guard,

329
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,308
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and Governor Wallace.

330
00:23:16,385 --> 00:23:19,149
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Because these National Guardsmen

331
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:22,658
{\fnTahoma\fs13}are here today as
federal soldiers for Alabama,

332
00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:24,661
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and they live within our borders.

333
00:23:24,729 --> 00:23:26,663
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They are our brothers.

334
00:23:26,732 --> 00:23:29,326
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We are winning in this fight,

335
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:32,336
{\fnTahoma\fs13}because we are awakening
the American people

336
00:23:32,405 --> 00:23:36,341
{\fnTahoma\fs13}to the dangers that
we have spoken about so many times

337
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,344
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that is so evident today...

338
00:23:38,412 --> 00:23:42,212
{\fnTahoma\fs13}A trend toward military
dictatorship in this country.

339
00:23:45,254 --> 00:23:47,188
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And so, at day's end,

340
00:23:47,256 --> 00:23:50,714
{\fnTahoma\fs13}the University of Alabama in
Tuscaloosa had been desegregated,

341
00:23:50,794 --> 00:23:53,319
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and students Jimmy Hood
and Vivian Malone

342
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:57,266
{\fnTahoma\fs13}had been signed up
for summer classes.

343
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,833
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Ma'am, you dropped your book.

344
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:02,499
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Ma'am.

345
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:05,009
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Govern or Wallace
did what he promised.

346
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:08,674
{\fnTahoma\fs13}By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob...

347
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,217
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Say, wasn't that Gump?

348
00:24:10,285 --> 00:24:12,310
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Naw, that couldn't be.

349
00:24:12,388 --> 00:24:15,323
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It sure as hell was.

350
00:24:18,729 --> 00:24:20,697
{\fnTahoma\fs13}A few years later,

351
00:24:20,765 --> 00:24:23,199
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that angry little man
at the school house door

352
00:24:23,268 --> 00:24:26,294
{\fnTahoma\fs13}thought it'd be a good idea
and ran for president.

353
00:24:29,242 --> 00:24:32,405
{\fnTahoma\fs13}But somebody thought
that it wasn't.

354
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:35,073
{\fnTahoma\fs13}But he didn't die.

355
00:24:40,255 --> 00:24:42,189
{\fnTahoma\fs13}My bus is here.

356
00:24:42,258 --> 00:24:44,192
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Is it the number 9?

357
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,194
{\fnTahoma\fs13}No, it's the number 4.

358
00:24:46,263 --> 00:24:48,788
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It was nice talking to you.

359
00:24:51,937 --> 00:24:53,700
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I remember when that happened,

360
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:55,205
{\fnTahoma\fs13}when Wallace got shot.

361
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:56,639
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I was in college.

362
00:24:56,709 --> 00:24:59,143
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Did you go to a girls' college

363
00:24:59,213 --> 00:25:01,579
{\fnTahoma\fs13}or a girls' and boys'
together college?

364
00:25:01,648 --> 00:25:02,842
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It was coed.

365
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:05,647
{\fnTahoma\fs13}'Cause Jenny went to a college
I couldn't go to.

366
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,813
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It was a college
just for girls.

367
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:11,326
{\fnTahoma\fs13}But I'd go and visit her
every chance I got.

368
00:25:16,817 --> 00:25:20,116
{\fnTahoma\fs13}#I don't know why I love you#

369
00:25:20,188 --> 00:25:23,680
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# But I do #

370
00:25:25,528 --> 00:25:29,521
{\fnTahoma\fs13}#I don't know why I cry so #

371
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,068
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# But I do #

372
00:25:35,306 --> 00:25:39,607
{\fnTahoma\fs13}#I only know I know that... #

373
00:25:41,681 --> 00:25:43,114
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That hurts.

374
00:25:43,183 --> 00:25:48,144
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# But I don't know why
I love you#

375
00:25:48,222 --> 00:25:51,214
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# But I do #

376
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,754
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest!

377
00:25:55,832 --> 00:25:58,096
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest!

378
00:25:58,168 --> 00:26:00,102
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest, stop it!

379
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,603
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Stop it!

380
00:26:01,673 --> 00:26:03,106
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What are you doing?

381
00:26:03,174 --> 00:26:04,607
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He was hurting you.

382
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:06,109
{\fnTahoma\fs13}No, he wasn't!

383
00:26:06,178 --> 00:26:08,112
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Get over there!

384
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,613
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Billy, I'm sorry.

385
00:26:09,683 --> 00:26:11,116
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Just keep away from me.

386
00:26:11,184 --> 00:26:13,118
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Don't be such... Don't go.

387
00:26:13,186 --> 00:26:15,120
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Billy, wait a second.

388
00:26:15,189 --> 00:26:17,555
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He doesn't know any better.

389
00:26:19,194 --> 00:26:22,220
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest, why'd you do that?

390
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:28,137
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I brought you some chocolate.

391
00:26:28,205 --> 00:26:29,433
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm sorry.

392
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,644
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'll go back
to my college now.

393
00:26:34,714 --> 00:26:35,976
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest...

394
00:26:39,219 --> 00:26:40,743
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Look at you.

395
00:26:42,723 --> 00:26:44,156
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Come on.

396
00:26:44,225 --> 00:26:45,317
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Come on.

397
00:26:52,502 --> 00:26:53,935
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Is this your own room?

398
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:54,936
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Shh!

399
00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:00,786
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Do you ever dream, Forrest...

400
00:27:02,355 --> 00:27:04,289
{\fnTahoma\fs13}about who you're going to be?

401
00:27:05,526 --> 00:27:06,959
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Who I'm going to be?

402
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:07,959
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yeah.

403
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:09,962
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Aren't I going to be me?

404
00:27:10,031 --> 00:27:11,293
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You'll always be you,

405
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:13,300
{\fnTahoma\fs13}just another kind of you.

406
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:15,462
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You know?

407
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:17,472
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I want to be famous.

408
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:22,304
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I want to be a singer
like Joan Baez.

409
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,314
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I just want to be...

410
00:27:24,382 --> 00:27:25,815
{\fnTahoma\fs13}on an empty stage

411
00:27:25,884 --> 00:27:28,478
{\fnTahoma\fs13}with my guitar, my voice.

412
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:31,148
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Just me.

413
00:27:32,892 --> 00:27:36,328
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And I want to reach people
on a personal level.

414
00:27:38,734 --> 00:27:41,168
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I want to be able
to say things,

415
00:27:41,236 --> 00:27:42,669
{\fnTahoma\fs13}just one to one.

416
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,105
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Have you ever been
with a girl, Forrest?

417
00:27:54,018 --> 00:27:55,451
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I sit next to them

418
00:27:55,521 --> 00:27:58,012
{\fnTahoma\fs13}in my home economics class
all the time.

419
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:28,221
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Oh, I'm sorry.

420
00:28:28,295 --> 00:28:29,319
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's O.K.

421
00:28:29,396 --> 00:28:30,328
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Sorry.

422
00:28:37,573 --> 00:28:39,063
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's all right.

423
00:28:42,312 --> 00:28:43,745
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's O.K.

424
00:28:43,814 --> 00:28:45,247
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Oh, I'm dizzy.

425
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:56,526
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'll bet that never
happened in home ec.

426
00:29:00,768 --> 00:29:02,201
{\fnTahoma\fs13}No.

427
00:29:07,941 --> 00:29:11,342
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I think I ruined
your roommate's bathrobe.

428
00:29:11,412 --> 00:29:13,846
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I don't care.
I don't like her anyway.

429
00:29:13,915 --> 00:29:16,509
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run! Run! Run! Run!

430
00:29:16,585 --> 00:29:18,678
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run! Run! Run! Run!

431
00:29:18,754 --> 00:29:20,187
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run! Run! Run! Run!

432
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,224
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run! Run!

433
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:25,227
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Stop! Stop! Stop!

434
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,368
{\fnTahoma\fs13}College ran by real fast

435
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:34,553
{\fnTahoma\fs13}'cause I played
so much football.

436
00:29:34,687 --> 00:29:35,813
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They even put me on a thing

437
00:29:35,888 --> 00:29:37,321
{\fnTahoma\fs13}called the all-America team

438
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,153
{\fnTahoma\fs13}where you get to meet

439
00:29:39,226 --> 00:29:41,160
{\fnTahoma\fs13}the president of the United States.

440
00:29:41,228 --> 00:29:42,490
{\fnTahoma\fs13}President Kennedy met

441
00:29:42,563 --> 00:29:44,724
{\fnTahoma\fs13}with the collegiate
all-American football team

442
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,182
{\fnTahoma\fs13}at the Oval Office today.

443
00:29:46,315 --> 00:29:48,010
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now the really good thing

444
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:51,020
{\fnTahoma\fs13}about meeting the president
of the United States

445
00:29:51,088 --> 00:29:52,521
{\fnTahoma\fs13}is the food.

446
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,854
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They put you in this little room

447
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:58,521
{\fnTahoma\fs13}with just about anything
you'd want to eat or drink.

448
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,189
{\fnTahoma\fs13}But since, number one,

449
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:01,858
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I wasn 't hungry but thirsty,

450
00:30:01,935 --> 00:30:04,529
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and number two, they was free,

451
00:30:04,605 --> 00:30:08,371
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I must have drank me
about 15 Dr. Peppers.

452
00:30:10,912 --> 00:30:13,506
{\fnTahoma\fs13}How does it feel
to be an all-American?

453
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:14,845
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's an honor, sir.

454
00:30:14,917 --> 00:30:17,511
{\fnTahoma\fs13}How does it feel
to be an all-American?

455
00:30:17,588 --> 00:30:19,556
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Very good, sir.

456
00:30:19,623 --> 00:30:22,217
{\fnTahoma\fs13}How does it feel
to be an all-American?

457
00:30:22,293 --> 00:30:23,726
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Very good, sir.

458
00:30:23,795 --> 00:30:25,729
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Congratulations.
How do you feel?

459
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:28,232
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I got to pee.

460
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,825
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I believe he said
he had to pee.

461
00:30:45,421 --> 00:30:48,185
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Some time later,
for noparticular reason,

462
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:51,558
{\fnTahoma\fs13}somebody shot
that nice young president

463
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,030
{\fnTahoma\fs13}when he was riding
in his car.

464
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,965
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And a few years after that,

465
00:30:56,035 --> 00:30:58,469
{\fnTahoma\fs13}somebody shot
his little brother, too,

466
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:00,871
{\fnTahoma\fs13}only he was
in a hotel kitchen.

467
00:31:02,109 --> 00:31:04,202
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Must be hard being brothers.

468
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,111
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I wouldn't know.

469
00:31:07,316 --> 00:31:08,578
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest Gump.

470
00:31:08,651 --> 00:31:10,084
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now can you believe it?

471
00:31:10,152 --> 00:31:12,586
{\fnTahoma\fs13}After only five years
of playing football,

472
00:31:12,656 --> 00:31:14,248
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I got a college degree.

473
00:31:14,324 --> 00:31:16,918
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Congratulations, son.

474
00:31:16,994 --> 00:31:19,121
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mama was so proud.

475
00:31:20,365 --> 00:31:22,629
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest, I'm so proud of you.

476
00:31:22,701 --> 00:31:24,293
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'll hold this for you.

477
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:26,463
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Congratulations, son.

478
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:29,133
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Have you given any thought
to your future?

479
00:31:31,212 --> 00:31:32,679
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Thought?

480
00:31:33,915 --> 00:31:35,849
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hello. I'm Forrest.
Forrest Gump.

481
00:31:35,918 --> 00:31:37,510
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Nobody gives a horse's shit

482
00:31:37,587 --> 00:31:39,179
{\fnTahoma\fs13}who you are, pus ball!

483
00:31:39,255 --> 00:31:42,019
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You're not even a lowlife,
scum-sucking maggot!

484
00:31:42,092 --> 00:31:44,356
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Get your maggoty ass
on the bus!

485
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:45,862
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You're in the army now!

486
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,693
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Seat's taken.

487
00:31:49,935 --> 00:31:51,027
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Taken.

488
00:31:54,107 --> 00:31:57,008
{\fnTahoma\fs13}At first it seemed
like I made a mistake.

489
00:31:57,078 --> 00:31:59,012
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It was only
my induction day,

490
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,139
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and I was getting yelled at.

491
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,314
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Sit down if you want to.

492
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,654
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I didn't know who I might meet

493
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,160
{\fnTahoma\fs13}or what they might ask.

494
00:32:11,228 --> 00:32:13,992
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You ever been
on a real shrimp boat?

495
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,828
{\fnTahoma\fs13}No.

496
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,664
{\fnTahoma\fs13}But I been on a real big boat.

497
00:32:18,738 --> 00:32:21,673
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm talking about
a shrimp catching boat.

498
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:24,676
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I been working on
shrimp boats all my life.

499
00:32:24,745 --> 00:32:27,009
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I started out
on my uncle's boat

500
00:32:27,081 --> 00:32:29,015
{\fnTahoma\fs13}when I was about maybe 9.

501
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:32,018
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I was just looking
into buying my own boat

502
00:32:32,087 --> 00:32:34,021
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and got drafted.

503
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:37,354
{\fnTahoma\fs13}My given name
is Benjamin Buford Blue.

504
00:32:37,427 --> 00:32:39,691
{\fnTahoma\fs13}People call me Bubba,

505
00:32:39,764 --> 00:32:42,198
{\fnTahoma\fs13}just like one of them
old red neck boys.

506
00:32:42,266 --> 00:32:43,528
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Can you believe that?

507
00:32:43,602 --> 00:32:45,695
{\fnTahoma\fs13}My name's Forrest Gump.

508
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:48,035
{\fnTahoma\fs13}People call me Forrest Gump.

509
00:32:48,107 --> 00:32:51,042
{\fnTahoma\fs13}So Bubba was from
Bayou La Batre, Alabama,

510
00:32:51,111 --> 00:32:52,840
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and his mama cooked shrimp.

511
00:32:54,815 --> 00:32:57,181
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And her mama
before her cooked shrimp,

512
00:32:57,252 --> 00:33:00,847
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.

513
00:33:00,923 --> 00:33:02,686
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Bubba's family knew everything

514
00:33:02,758 --> 00:33:05,192
{\fnTahoma\fs13}there was to know about
the shrimping business.

515
00:33:05,262 --> 00:33:07,526
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I know everything
there is to know

516
00:33:07,597 --> 00:33:08,859
{\fnTahoma\fs13}about the shrimping business.

517
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:11,367
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm going into
the shrimping business for myself

518
00:33:11,436 --> 00:33:13,700
{\fnTahoma\fs13}after I get out of the army.

519
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:17,598
{\fnTahoma\fs13}O.K.

520
00:33:17,677 --> 00:33:18,939
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Gump!

521
00:33:19,012 --> 00:33:21,606
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What's your sole purpose
in this army?

522
00:33:21,682 --> 00:33:24,116
{\fnTahoma\fs13}To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!

523
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:27,780
{\fnTahoma\fs13}God damn it, Gump,
you're a goddamn genius.

524
00:33:27,856 --> 00:33:30,290
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That's the most outstanding
answer I've ever heard.

525
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,954
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You must have
a goddamn I. Q Of 160.

526
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,624
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You are goddamn gifted,
Private Gump.

527
00:33:36,867 --> 00:33:39,131
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Listen up, people!

528
00:33:39,204 --> 00:33:42,139
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now for some reason,
I fit in the army

529
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:44,142
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Like one of them round pegs.

530
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,472
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's not really hard.

531
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:47,479
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You just make your bed neat,

532
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:48,980
{\fnTahoma\fs13}remember to stand up straight,

533
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:50,641
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and always answer every question

534
00:33:50,718 --> 00:33:52,652
{\fnTahoma\fs13}with "Yes, Drill Sergeant."

535
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,153
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Is that clear?

536
00:33:54,223 --> 00:33:56,487
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yes, Drill Sergeant!

537
00:33:56,558 --> 00:33:59,994
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What you do is drag your nets
along the bottom.

538
00:34:00,063 --> 00:34:01,325
{\fnTahoma\fs13}On a good day,

539
00:34:01,398 --> 00:34:04,333
{\fnTahoma\fs13}you can catch over
a hundred pounds of shrimp.

540
00:34:04,402 --> 00:34:05,664
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Everything goes all right,

541
00:34:05,736 --> 00:34:07,499
{\fnTahoma\fs13}2 men shrimping 10 hours,

542
00:34:07,572 --> 00:34:09,665
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Less what you spends on gas...

543
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:11,834
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Done, Drill Sergeant!

544
00:34:11,911 --> 00:34:13,344
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Gump!

545
00:34:14,915 --> 00:34:17,850
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly?

546
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,852
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You told me to,
Drill Sergeant.

547
00:34:19,921 --> 00:34:21,513
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jesus H. Christ.

548
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:23,523
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This is a new company record.

549
00:34:23,592 --> 00:34:25,025
{\fnTahoma\fs13}If it wasn't a waste

550
00:34:25,094 --> 00:34:26,527
{\fnTahoma\fs13}of a fine enlisted man,

551
00:34:26,595 --> 00:34:29,029
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'd recommend you for O.C.S.,
Private Gump.

552
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,363
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You're going to be
a general someday!

553
00:34:31,435 --> 00:34:33,369
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now disassemble your weapon
and continue!

554
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,374
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Anyway, like I was saying,

555
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:39,707
{\fnTahoma\fs13}shrimp is the fruit
of the sea.

556
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:43,043
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it,

557
00:34:43,116 --> 00:34:44,549
{\fnTahoma\fs13}bake it, saute it.

558
00:34:44,618 --> 00:34:47,712
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They's, uh, shrimp kabobs,
shrimp creole,

559
00:34:47,788 --> 00:34:51,724
{\fnTahoma\fs13}shrimp gumbo,
pan fried, deep fried,

560
00:34:51,793 --> 00:34:53,055
{\fnTahoma\fs13}stir fried.

561
00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:54,892
{\fnTahoma\fs13}There's pineapple shrimp

562
00:34:54,964 --> 00:34:57,831
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and lemon shrimp,
coconut shrimp,

563
00:34:57,901 --> 00:34:59,027
{\fnTahoma\fs13}pepper shrimp,

564
00:34:59,102 --> 00:35:01,536
{\fnTahoma\fs13}shrimp soup, shrimp stew,

565
00:35:01,606 --> 00:35:03,198
{\fnTahoma\fs13}shrimp salad,

566
00:35:03,274 --> 00:35:05,037
{\fnTahoma\fs13}shrimp in potatoes,

567
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,543
{\fnTahoma\fs13}shrimp burger,

568
00:35:06,612 --> 00:35:08,375
{\fnTahoma\fs13}shrimp sandwich.

569
00:35:10,617 --> 00:35:12,710
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That... That's about it.

570
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:20,121
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Night time in the army
is alonely time.

571
00:35:20,195 --> 00:35:22,629
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We'd lay there in our bunks,

572
00:35:22,699 --> 00:35:25,133
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and I'd miss my mama,

573
00:35:25,201 --> 00:35:27,795
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and I'd miss Jenny.

574
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:33,143
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, Gump.

575
00:35:33,211 --> 00:35:35,805
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Get a load of the tits on her.

576
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:49,997
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Turns out...

577
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,158
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny had gotten
in to some trouble

578
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:55,500
{\fnTahoma\fs13}over some photos of her
in her college sweater.

579
00:35:55,573 --> 00:35:57,768
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And she was
thrown out of school.

580
00:35:57,842 --> 00:36:01,005
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# My baby does the hanky panky #

581
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:03,513
{\fnTahoma\fs13}But that wasn't a bad thing,

582
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:06,017
{\fnTahoma\fs13}'cause a man who owns a theater

583
00:36:06,085 --> 00:36:07,518
{\fnTahoma\fs13}in Memphis, Tennessee,

584
00:36:07,587 --> 00:36:09,179
{\fnTahoma\fs13}saw those photos

585
00:36:09,256 --> 00:36:13,022
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.

586
00:36:13,094 --> 00:36:15,187
{\fnTahoma\fs13}The first chance I got,

587
00:36:15,263 --> 00:36:17,527
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I took the bus up to Memphis

588
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,864
{\fnTahoma\fs13}to see her perform in that show.

589
00:36:19,936 --> 00:36:21,369
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That was Amber, Amber Flame.

590
00:36:21,438 --> 00:36:22,871
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Give her a big hand.

591
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,875
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,

592
00:36:25,944 --> 00:36:27,707
{\fnTahoma\fs13}direct from Hollywood,
California,

593
00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:29,542
{\fnTahoma\fs13}our very own beatnik beauty.

594
00:36:29,615 --> 00:36:31,879
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Let's give a big round of applause

595
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:33,714
{\fnTahoma\fs13}to the luscious Bobbie Dylan.

596
00:36:42,965 --> 00:36:48,734
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# How many roads
must a man walk down #

597
00:36:48,805 --> 00:36:54,176
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Before you can
call him a man? #

598
00:36:54,245 --> 00:37:00,446
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Yes, and how many seas
must the white dove sail #

599
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,453
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Her dream had come true.

600
00:37:02,522 --> 00:37:04,456
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Before she sleeps
in the sand? #

601
00:37:04,524 --> 00:37:06,355
{\fnTahoma\fs13}She was a folk singer.

602
00:37:06,427 --> 00:37:09,521
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Yes, and how many times #

603
00:37:09,597 --> 00:37:12,657
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Must the cannon balls fly #

604
00:37:12,735 --> 00:37:17,332
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Before they're
forever banned? #

605
00:37:17,407 --> 00:37:18,738
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Shake it up now.

606
00:37:18,808 --> 00:37:20,241
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Somebody get her a harmonica.

607
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:22,040
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# The answer, my friend #

608
00:37:22,113 --> 00:37:23,876
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Is blowin' in the wind #

609
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:25,382
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This ain't Captain Kangaroo.

610
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:28,214
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, honey, I got
something here for you.

611
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:30,346
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey! God damn it!

612
00:37:30,423 --> 00:37:32,687
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, you stupid jerk!

613
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,523
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm singing a song here.

614
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,032
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Polly, get out here!

615
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,534
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Shut up yourself!

616
00:37:41,604 --> 00:37:43,071
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Just shut up!

617
00:37:45,642 --> 00:37:48,577
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest! What are you
doing here?

618
00:37:48,646 --> 00:37:49,977
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What are you doing?

619
00:37:51,049 --> 00:37:52,812
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What are you doing, Forrest?

620
00:37:52,885 --> 00:37:54,910
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Let me down!

621
00:37:59,084 --> 00:38:01,518
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You can't keep
doing this, Forrest.

622
00:38:01,588 --> 00:38:04,022
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You can't keep
trying to rescue me.

623
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,887
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They was trying to grab you.

624
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,292
{\fnTahoma\fs13}A lot of people try to grab me.

625
00:38:08,362 --> 00:38:12,355
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.

626
00:38:12,434 --> 00:38:15,961
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I can't help it.
I love you.

627
00:38:16,038 --> 00:38:18,302
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest...

628
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:20,343
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You don't know what love is.

629
00:38:27,086 --> 00:38:30,021
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

630
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:34,860
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We prayed for God
to turn me into a bird

631
00:38:34,929 --> 00:38:36,863
{\fnTahoma\fs13}so I could fly far away.

632
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:39,691
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yes, I do.

633
00:38:42,672 --> 00:38:45,106
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You think I could
fly off this bridge?

634
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:55,376
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What do you mean, Jenny?

635
00:38:58,557 --> 00:38:59,819
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Nothing.

636
00:39:02,896 --> 00:39:05,160
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I got to get out of here.

637
00:39:07,402 --> 00:39:08,494
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Wait, Jenny.

638
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:11,004
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest, you stay
away from me, O. K?

639
00:39:11,073 --> 00:39:13,007
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You stay away from me, please.

640
00:39:13,076 --> 00:39:14,509
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Can I have a ride?

641
00:39:14,577 --> 00:39:15,839
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Where are you going?

642
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:17,004
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I don't care.

643
00:39:17,081 --> 00:39:18,309
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Get in the truck.

644
00:39:18,382 --> 00:39:20,577
{\fnTahoma\fs13}So bye-bye, Jenny.

645
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:24,854
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They sending me to Vietnam.

646
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:29,392
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's this whole other country.

647
00:39:31,966 --> 00:39:33,729
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Just hang on a minute.

648
00:39:35,303 --> 00:39:38,238
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Listen, you promise me
something, O. K?

649
00:39:38,307 --> 00:39:40,241
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Just if you're
ever in trouble,

650
00:39:40,309 --> 00:39:41,571
{\fnTahoma\fs13}don't be brave.

651
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:44,580
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You just run, O. K?
Just run away.

652
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,013
{\fnTahoma\fs13}O.K.

653
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:52,519
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny.

654
00:39:54,094 --> 00:39:57,188
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'll write you all the time.

655
00:40:05,774 --> 00:40:07,580
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And just like that,
she was gone.

656
00:40:07,581 --> 00:40:09,344
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And just like that,
she was gone.

657
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:27,036
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You come back safe to me.

658
00:40:27,105 --> 00:40:28,538
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Do you hear?

659
00:40:48,126 --> 00:40:49,718
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Some folks are born #

660
00:40:49,794 --> 00:40:52,058
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Made to wave the flag #

661
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:55,395
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Ooh, they're red,
white, and blue #

662
00:40:55,467 --> 00:40:58,994
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# And when the band plays
"Hail To The Chief" #

663
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:02,665
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Ooh, they'll point
the cannon at you #

664
00:41:02,741 --> 00:41:04,504
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# It ain't me #

665
00:41:04,576 --> 00:41:06,510
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# It ain't me #

666
00:41:06,578 --> 00:41:09,672
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# I ain't no senator's son #

667
00:41:09,748 --> 00:41:11,511
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# It ain't me #

668
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:13,016
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now they told us

669
00:41:13,084 --> 00:41:16,019
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that Vietnam was going
to be very different

670
00:41:16,087 --> 00:41:18,112
{\fnTahoma\fs13}from the United States
of America.

671
00:41:18,189 --> 00:41:22,285
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Except for all
the beer cans and barbecues,

672
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,123
{\fnTahoma\fs13}it was.

673
00:41:33,872 --> 00:41:36,966
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, I'll bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

674
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:39,977
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimp.

675
00:41:40,045 --> 00:41:41,979
{\fnTahoma\fs13}After we win this war

676
00:41:42,047 --> 00:41:43,674
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and we take over everything,

677
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:46,012
{\fnTahoma\fs13}we can get American
shrimpers out here

678
00:41:46,084 --> 00:41:47,346
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and shrimp these waters.

679
00:41:47,419 --> 00:41:49,353
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Just shrimp all the time, man.

680
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:54,354
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You must be my FNGs.

681
00:41:54,426 --> 00:41:55,518
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Morning, sir.

682
00:41:55,594 --> 00:41:57,118
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Oh, get your hands down.

683
00:41:57,195 --> 00:41:58,628
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Do not salute me.

684
00:41:58,697 --> 00:42:01,131
{\fnTahoma\fs13}There are goddamn snipers
all around this area

685
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:03,292
{\fnTahoma\fs13}who'd love
to grease an officer.

686
00:42:03,368 --> 00:42:06,633
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fort Platoon.

687
00:42:07,872 --> 00:42:09,464
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What's wrong with your lip?

688
00:42:10,542 --> 00:42:12,806
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I was born with big gums, sir.

689
00:42:12,877 --> 00:42:14,970
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well, you better tuck that in.

690
00:42:15,046 --> 00:42:17,480
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Gonna get that caught
on a trip wire.

691
00:42:18,717 --> 00:42:21,151
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Where are you boys
from in the world?

692
00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:22,311
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Alabama, sir!
Alabama, sir!

693
00:42:23,555 --> 00:42:24,522
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You twins?

694
00:42:26,758 --> 00:42:29,352
{\fnTahoma\fs13}No. We are not relations, sir.

695
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:32,691
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Look,

696
00:42:32,764 --> 00:42:34,095
{\fnTahoma\fs13}it's pretty basic here.

697
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:36,428
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You stick with me

698
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:37,934
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and learn from the guys

699
00:42:38,003 --> 00:42:39,937
{\fnTahoma\fs13}who've been in country a while,

700
00:42:40,005 --> 00:42:41,267
{\fnTahoma\fs13}you'll be all right.

701
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:43,603
{\fnTahoma\fs13}There is one item of G.I. gear

702
00:42:43,675 --> 00:42:46,769
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that can be the difference
between life and death...

703
00:42:46,845 --> 00:42:47,903
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Socks.

704
00:42:47,979 --> 00:42:50,004
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Cushioned sole, O.D. green.

705
00:42:50,081 --> 00:42:51,912
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Try and keep your feet dry.

706
00:42:51,983 --> 00:42:54,417
{\fnTahoma\fs13}When we're out humpin',
change your socks

707
00:42:54,486 --> 00:42:55,680
{\fnTahoma\fs13}whenever we stop.

708
00:42:55,754 --> 00:42:58,018
{\fnTahoma\fs13}The Mekong will eat
a grunt's feet

709
00:42:58,089 --> 00:42:59,522
{\fnTahoma\fs13}right off his legs.

710
00:42:59,591 --> 00:43:01,024
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Sergeant Sims. God damn it,

711
00:43:01,092 --> 00:43:03,526
{\fnTahoma\fs13}where's that sling rope
I said to order?

712
00:43:03,595 --> 00:43:05,028
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I put in the requisitions.

713
00:43:05,096 --> 00:43:07,360
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well, you call
those sons of bitches...

714
00:43:07,432 --> 00:43:09,525
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Lieutenant Dan
sure knew his stuff.

715
00:43:09,601 --> 00:43:12,536
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I felt real lucky
he was my lieutenant.

716
00:43:12,604 --> 00:43:16,267
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He was from a long,
great military tradition.

717
00:43:16,341 --> 00:43:18,866
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Somebody in his family
had fought

718
00:43:18,943 --> 00:43:20,410
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and died

719
00:43:20,478 --> 00:43:22,070
{\fnTahoma\fs13}in every...

720
00:43:22,147 --> 00:43:23,273
{\fnTahoma\fs13}single...

721
00:43:23,348 --> 00:43:25,441
{\fnTahoma\fs13}American war.

722
00:43:25,517 --> 00:43:27,451
{\fnTahoma\fs13}God damn it, kick some ass.

723
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:28,781
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Get on it!

724
00:43:28,853 --> 00:43:30,286
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I guess you could say

725
00:43:30,355 --> 00:43:32,789
{\fnTahoma\fs13}he had a lot to live up to.

726
00:43:33,858 --> 00:43:35,792
{\fnTahoma\fs13}So, you boys
from Arkansas, huh?

727
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,952
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well,

728
00:43:37,028 --> 00:43:38,791
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I been through there.

729
00:43:38,863 --> 00:43:41,627
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Little Rock's a fine town.

730
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,463
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now, shake down your gear.

731
00:43:43,535 --> 00:43:44,797
{\fnTahoma\fs13}See the platoon sergeant.

732
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:47,633
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Draw what you need
for the field.

733
00:43:47,706 --> 00:43:49,139
{\fnTahoma\fs13}If you boys are hungry,

734
00:43:49,207 --> 00:43:51,971
{\fnTahoma\fs13}we got steaks burning
right over here.

735
00:43:52,043 --> 00:43:54,807
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Two standing orders
in this platoon...

736
00:43:54,879 --> 00:43:57,404
{\fnTahoma\fs13}1... take care of your feet,

737
00:43:57,482 --> 00:44:01,077
{\fnTahoma\fs13}2... try not to do
anything stupid,

738
00:44:01,152 --> 00:44:02,744
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Like getting
yourself killed.

739
00:44:08,993 --> 00:44:11,518
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I sure hope I don't
let him down.

740
00:44:22,707 --> 00:44:25,642
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I got to see
a lot of the country side.

741
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:28,110
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We would take
these real long walks.

742
00:44:30,181 --> 00:44:32,115
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# There must be
some kind of way #

743
00:44:32,183 --> 00:44:34,276
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Out of here #

744
00:44:34,352 --> 00:44:36,445
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Said the joker
to the thief #

745
00:44:36,521 --> 00:44:37,954
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And we were always lookin'

746
00:44:38,022 --> 00:44:39,956
{\fnTahoma\fs13}for this guy named Charlie.

747
00:44:40,024 --> 00:44:41,616
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# There's too much confusion #

748
00:44:43,027 --> 00:44:45,791
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# I can't get no relief #

749
00:44:48,366 --> 00:44:49,458
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hold it up!

750
00:44:49,534 --> 00:44:50,967
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hold up, boys!

751
00:44:52,537 --> 00:44:55,563
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It wasn't always fun.

752
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,905
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Lieutenant Dan was always
getting these funny feelings

753
00:44:58,977 --> 00:45:02,071
{\fnTahoma\fs13}about a rock or a trail
or the road,

754
00:45:02,147 --> 00:45:05,082
{\fnTahoma\fs13}so he'd tell us
to get down, shut up.

755
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,242
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Get down!

756
00:45:06,317 --> 00:45:07,409
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Shut up!

757
00:45:08,486 --> 00:45:09,748
{\fnTahoma\fs13}So we did.

758
00:45:26,271 --> 00:45:29,536
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now I don't know
much about anything,

759
00:45:29,607 --> 00:45:32,542
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but I think some of
America's best young men

760
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,872
{\fnTahoma\fs13}served in this war.

761
00:45:33,945 --> 00:45:36,209
{\fnTahoma\fs13}There was Dallas from Phoenix.

762
00:45:37,615 --> 00:45:40,379
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Cleveland...
he was from Detroit.

763
00:45:40,451 --> 00:45:41,679
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, Tex.

764
00:45:41,753 --> 00:45:43,243
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, Tex.

765
00:45:43,321 --> 00:45:44,913
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What the hell's going on?

766
00:45:44,989 --> 00:45:47,184
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And Tex was...

767
00:45:47,258 --> 00:45:49,852
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from...

768
00:45:49,928 --> 00:45:51,452
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Ah, nothing.

769
00:45:55,366 --> 00:45:57,391
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Fourth platoon, on your feet.

770
00:45:57,468 --> 00:46:00,369
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Y'all got 10 clicks
to go to that river.

771
00:46:00,438 --> 00:46:02,030
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Move out.

772
00:46:02,106 --> 00:46:04,540
{\fnTahoma\fs13}1, 2! Hup!

773
00:46:05,944 --> 00:46:07,377
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Step it up!

774
00:46:07,445 --> 00:46:08,776
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Look alive out there.

775
00:46:08,847 --> 00:46:10,280
{\fnTahoma\fs13}The good thing about Vietnam

776
00:46:10,348 --> 00:46:12,612
{\fnTahoma\fs13}is there was always
someplace to go.

777
00:46:12,684 --> 00:46:13,946
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Fire in the hole!

778
00:46:17,522 --> 00:46:20,116
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Gump, check out that hole.

779
00:46:20,191 --> 00:46:23,126
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And there was always
something to do.

780
00:46:23,194 --> 00:46:24,286
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mount'em up!

781
00:46:24,362 --> 00:46:26,159
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Spread out!
Cover his back!

782
00:46:31,236 --> 00:46:33,830
{\fnTahoma\fs13}One day it started raining,

783
00:46:33,905 --> 00:46:37,238
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and it didn't quit for four months.

784
00:46:37,308 --> 00:46:40,744
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We've been through
every kind of rain there is...

785
00:46:40,812 --> 00:46:43,440
{\fnTahoma\fs13}little bitty stinging rain

786
00:46:44,197 --> 00:46:47,406
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and big old fat rain,

787
00:46:47,467 --> 00:46:49,909
{\fnTahoma\fs13}rain that flew in side ways,

788
00:46:50,027 --> 00:46:51,688
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and sometimes rain even seemed

789
00:46:51,765 --> 00:46:55,097
{\fnTahoma\fs13}to come straight up
from underneath.

790
00:46:55,169 --> 00:46:58,695
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Shoot, it even rained at night.

791
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,534
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, Forrest.

792
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:01,697
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, Bubba.

793
00:47:01,779 --> 00:47:04,041
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm going to lean up against you.

794
00:47:04,115 --> 00:47:05,545
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You lean up against me.

795
00:47:05,617 --> 00:47:07,879
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This way we don't have to sleep

796
00:47:07,955 --> 00:47:09,885
{\fnTahoma\fs13}with our heads in the mud.

797
00:47:09,957 --> 00:47:12,549
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You know why we're
a good partnership, Forrest?

798
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:15,892
{\fnTahoma\fs13}'Cause we be watching out
for one another,

799
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,727
{\fnTahoma\fs13}like brothers and stuff.

800
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:21,229
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, Forrest,

801
00:47:21,309 --> 00:47:23,399
{\fnTahoma\fs13}something I been thinking about.

802
00:47:23,478 --> 00:47:26,410
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I got a very important
question to ask you.

803
00:47:28,151 --> 00:47:30,081
{\fnTahoma\fs13}How would you like to go

804
00:47:30,154 --> 00:47:32,084
{\fnTahoma\fs13}into the shrimping
business with me?

805
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:34,920
{\fnTahoma\fs13}O.K.

806
00:47:34,995 --> 00:47:36,755
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Man, I tell you what.

807
00:47:36,832 --> 00:47:39,094
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I got it all figured out, too.

808
00:47:39,169 --> 00:47:40,599
{\fnTahoma\fs13}So many pounds of shrimp

809
00:47:40,671 --> 00:47:42,101
{\fnTahoma\fs13}will pay off the boat.

810
00:47:42,173 --> 00:47:43,603
{\fnTahoma\fs13}So many pounds for gas.

811
00:47:43,674 --> 00:47:45,604
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We'll live right on the boat.

812
00:47:45,678 --> 00:47:47,940
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We ain't got to pay no rent.

813
00:47:48,015 --> 00:47:49,945
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We can just work it together,

814
00:47:50,018 --> 00:47:51,948
{\fnTahoma\fs13}split everything right
down the middle.

815
00:47:52,021 --> 00:47:54,111
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

816
00:47:54,191 --> 00:47:57,215
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

817
00:47:58,796 --> 00:48:01,388
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That's a fine idea.

818
00:48:01,468 --> 00:48:04,229
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Bubba did have a fine idea.

819
00:48:07,644 --> 00:48:08,904
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I even wrote Jenny

820
00:48:08,979 --> 00:48:10,909
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and told her all about it.

821
00:48:10,982 --> 00:48:12,572
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I sent her letters...

822
00:48:12,652 --> 00:48:14,742
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Not every day, but almost.

823
00:48:14,821 --> 00:48:17,083
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I told her what I was doing

824
00:48:17,158 --> 00:48:19,591
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and asked her what she was doing

825
00:48:19,662 --> 00:48:22,854
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and told her how
I thought about her always.

826
00:48:24,226 --> 00:48:26,156
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And how I was looking forward

827
00:48:26,229 --> 00:48:28,159
{\fnTahoma\fs13}to getting a letter from her

828
00:48:28,232 --> 00:48:30,993
{\fnTahoma\fs13}just as soon
as she had the time.

829
00:48:31,071 --> 00:48:34,003
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'd always let her know
that I was O. K.

830
00:48:34,074 --> 00:48:41,504
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Then I'd sign each letter
"Love, Forrest Gump."

831
00:48:51,432 --> 00:48:54,193
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# There's somethin'
happenin' here #

832
00:48:55,539 --> 00:48:59,133
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This one day, we was out
walking like always,

833
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:02,974
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and then, just like that,

834
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,980
{\fnTahoma\fs13}somebody turned off the rain,

835
00:49:05,053 --> 00:49:06,643
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and the sun come out.

836
00:49:06,722 --> 00:49:09,483
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# I got to beware #

837
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,650
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Ambush!

838
00:49:11,729 --> 00:49:13,659
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Take cover!

839
00:49:22,247 --> 00:49:24,873
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Get that pig up here,
god damn it!

840
00:49:25,009 --> 00:49:27,134
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest! You okay?

841
00:49:29,749 --> 00:49:32,647
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Strong-arm, Strong-arm!

842
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,515
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey! We got a man down!

843
00:49:35,591 --> 00:49:39,048
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Strong-arm,
this is Leg Lima 6! Over!

844
00:49:39,129 --> 00:49:41,562
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Roger, Strong-arm!
Be advised we have incoming

845
00:49:41,634 --> 00:49:44,033
{\fnTahoma\fs13}from the tree line at point blue

846
00:49:44,104 --> 00:49:46,434
{\fnTahoma\fs13}plus two!
A.K. s and rockets!

847
00:49:46,508 --> 00:49:47,768
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We're getting it hard!

848
00:49:47,842 --> 00:49:49,398
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Misfire! Misfire!

849
00:49:50,479 --> 00:49:52,274
{\fnTahoma\fs13}God damn it!

850
00:49:53,852 --> 00:49:57,785
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Get that pig unfucked
and on the treeline!

851
00:49:59,626 --> 00:50:02,218
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They got us,
and it hurt.

852
00:50:02,298 --> 00:50:05,789
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We're going to move
back to the blue line.

853
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,768
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Pull back! Pull back!

854
00:50:08,841 --> 00:50:10,828
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest! Run, Forrest!

855
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:12,636
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Pull back!

856
00:50:12,713 --> 00:50:14,906
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run! Run, man!

857
00:50:14,984 --> 00:50:16,072
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run!

858
00:50:16,152 --> 00:50:17,412
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Pull back, Gump!

859
00:50:18,989 --> 00:50:22,149
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Run, God damn it! Run!

860
00:50:48,099 --> 00:50:52,124
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I ran and ran
just like Jenny told me to.

861
00:50:54,876 --> 00:50:57,069
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I ran so far so fast

862
00:50:57,145 --> 00:50:59,578
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that pretty soon
I was all by myself,

863
00:50:59,649 --> 00:51:01,239
{\fnTahoma\fs13}which was a bad thing.

864
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:02,407
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Bubba.

865
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:07,080
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Bubba was my best good friend.

866
00:51:07,161 --> 00:51:09,594
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I had to make sure he was O.K.

867
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:21,112
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Where the hell are you?

868
00:51:21,181 --> 00:51:23,271
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Bubba!

869
00:51:23,352 --> 00:51:26,284
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And on my way
back to find Bubba,

870
00:51:26,357 --> 00:51:29,118
{\fnTahoma\fs13}well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.

871
00:51:29,195 --> 00:51:30,179
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Tex.

872
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:33,721
{\fnTahoma\fs13}O.K.

873
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,233
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I couldn't let him
lay there all alone,

874
00:51:36,305 --> 00:51:37,735
{\fnTahoma\fs13}scared the way he was,

875
00:51:37,807 --> 00:51:39,567
{\fnTahoma\fs13}so I grabbed him up

876
00:51:39,643 --> 00:51:41,369
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and run him out of there.

877
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,328
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Every time I went back
looking for Bubba,

878
00:51:59,405 --> 00:52:00,835
{\fnTahoma\fs13}somebody else was saying,

879
00:52:00,906 --> 00:52:03,838
{\fnTahoma\fs13}"Help me, Forrest, help me!"

880
00:52:10,422 --> 00:52:12,581
{\fnTahoma\fs13}O.K. Here. Here.

881
00:52:14,896 --> 00:52:17,862
{\fnTahoma\fs13}No sweat, man.
Lay back. You'll be O.K.

882
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:24,730
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.

883
00:52:24,811 --> 00:52:26,241
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I know my position

884
00:52:26,312 --> 00:52:28,209
{\fnTahoma\fs13}is danger close!

885
00:52:28,282 --> 00:52:30,715
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We got Charlie
all over this area.

886
00:52:30,787 --> 00:52:33,719
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I got to have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

887
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:36,224
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Lieutenant Dan,
Coleman's dead!

888
00:52:36,295 --> 00:52:37,725
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I know he's dead!

889
00:52:37,797 --> 00:52:40,729
{\fnTahoma\fs13}My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!

890
00:52:40,802 --> 00:52:42,232
{\fnTahoma\fs13}God damn it!

891
00:52:42,303 --> 00:52:44,233
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What are you doing?

892
00:52:44,306 --> 00:52:45,736
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You leave me here!

893
00:52:45,808 --> 00:52:47,738
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Get away.
Just leave me here!

894
00:52:47,811 --> 00:52:49,241
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Get out!

895
00:52:49,314 --> 00:52:53,247
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Aah! God, I said
leave me here, God damn it!

896
00:52:53,319 --> 00:52:55,683
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Leg Lima, this is Strong-arm.

897
00:52:55,757 --> 00:52:58,723
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Be advised your fast movers
are in bound. Over.

898
00:52:58,794 --> 00:53:02,194
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Then it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.

899
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:05,027
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Aah! Something bit me!

900
00:53:11,947 --> 00:53:13,877
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You son of a bitch!

901
00:53:15,353 --> 00:53:18,377
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I can't leave the platoon.

902
00:53:18,456 --> 00:53:21,388
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I told you
to leave me there, Gump.

903
00:53:21,462 --> 00:53:23,426
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forget about me.
Get your self out!

904
00:53:23,499 --> 00:53:25,728
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Did you hear what I said?

905
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:28,234
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Gump, damn it, put me down.

906
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:30,828
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Get your ass out of here.

907
00:53:32,813 --> 00:53:35,938
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I didn't ask you to pull me out
of there, God damn you!

908
00:53:36,018 --> 00:53:38,950
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Where the hell
do you think you're going?

909
00:53:39,022 --> 00:53:40,452
{\fnTahoma\fs13}To get Bubba.

910
00:53:40,525 --> 00:53:43,457
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I got an air strike
in bound right now.

911
00:53:43,528 --> 00:53:46,018
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They're going to nape
the whole area.

912
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:47,564
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Stay here!
That's an order.

913
00:53:47,635 --> 00:53:49,065
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I gotta find Bubba!

914
00:54:04,292 --> 00:54:05,984
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest.

915
00:54:13,306 --> 00:54:14,635
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Bubba.

916
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,537
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm O.K., Forrest.

917
00:54:16,611 --> 00:54:18,133
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm O.K.

918
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,580
{\fnTahoma\fs13}O-Oh, Bubba, no.

919
00:54:28,663 --> 00:54:30,458
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'll be all right.

920
00:54:38,844 --> 00:54:39,932
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Come on.

921
00:54:40,013 --> 00:54:41,739
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Come on. Come on.

922
00:54:45,721 --> 00:54:48,415
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Ugh. I'm O.K., Forrest.

923
00:54:51,364 --> 00:54:53,294
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm O.K. I'm fine.

924
00:55:29,821 --> 00:55:32,845
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Top smoke. Get it up there.

925
00:55:32,926 --> 00:55:35,790
{\fnTahoma\fs13}If I'd have known
this was going to be

926
00:55:35,862 --> 00:55:38,794
{\fnTahoma\fs13}the last time
me and Bubba was gonna talk,

927
00:55:38,867 --> 00:55:41,799
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'd of thought of
something better to say.

928
00:55:41,873 --> 00:55:42,926
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, Bubba.

929
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:44,267
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, Forrest.

930
00:55:46,712 --> 00:55:48,142
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest...

931
00:55:48,216 --> 00:55:51,307
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Why did this happen?

932
00:55:51,387 --> 00:55:54,319
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You got shot.

933
00:55:54,389 --> 00:55:58,758
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.

934
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:02,390
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I want to go home.

935
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:05,265
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Bubba was my best good friend.

936
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:07,270
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And even I know

937
00:56:07,343 --> 00:56:10,778
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that ain't something you can
find just around the corner.

938
00:56:10,849 --> 00:56:14,284
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Bubba was going to be
a shrimping boat captain,

939
00:56:14,355 --> 00:56:18,654
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but instead, he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.

940
00:56:24,236 --> 00:56:26,566
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That's all I have
to say about that.

941
00:56:28,777 --> 00:56:30,970
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It was a bullet, wasn't it?

942
00:56:32,883 --> 00:56:34,313
{\fnTahoma\fs13}A bullet?

943
00:56:34,384 --> 00:56:37,112
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That jumped up and bit you.

944
00:56:38,257 --> 00:56:40,119
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Oh. Yes, sir.

945
00:56:40,193 --> 00:56:42,819
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Bit me directly
in the but-tocks.

946
00:56:42,896 --> 00:56:47,333
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They said it was a million
dollar wound, but...

947
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:49,333
{\fnTahoma\fs13}the army must keep that money,

948
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:53,339
{\fnTahoma\fs13}'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

949
00:56:53,412 --> 00:56:57,168
{\fnTahoma\fs13}The only good thing about being
wounded in the but-tocks

950
00:56:57,306 --> 00:56:59,066
{\fnTahoma\fs13}is the ice cream.

951
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:02,039
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They gave me all
the ice cream I could eat.

952
00:57:02,113 --> 00:57:03,543
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And guess what?

953
00:57:03,614 --> 00:57:07,514
{\fnTahoma\fs13}A good friend of mine was
in the bed right next door.

954
00:57:08,824 --> 00:57:11,882
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

955
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:16,491
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Lieutenant Dan, ice cream!

956
00:57:27,351 --> 00:57:30,112
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's time for
your bath, Lieutenant.

957
00:57:38,366 --> 00:57:39,762
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Harper!

958
00:57:43,374 --> 00:57:44,804
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Cooper.

959
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:45,803
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Larson.

960
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,140
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Webster.

961
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:51,814
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Gump.

962
00:57:51,886 --> 00:57:53,316
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Gump!

963
00:57:53,389 --> 00:57:55,014
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm Forrest Gump.

964
00:57:57,327 --> 00:57:58,723
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Kyle.

965
00:58:00,332 --> 00:58:01,661
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Nichols.

966
00:58:03,404 --> 00:58:05,768
{\fnTahoma\fs13}McMill.

967
00:58:05,841 --> 00:58:06,825
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Johnson.

968
00:58:17,908 --> 00:58:20,874
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Surprise, surprise, surprise!

969
00:58:23,683 --> 00:58:27,118
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Gump, how can you
watch that stupid shit?

970
00:58:27,188 --> 00:58:28,618
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Turn it off.

971
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:31,123
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You are tuned
to the American forces

972
00:58:31,195 --> 00:58:32,625
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Vietnam network.

973
00:58:32,697 --> 00:58:34,253
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This is channel 6, Saigon.

974
00:58:36,701 --> 00:58:38,359
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Good catch, Gump.

975
00:58:40,207 --> 00:58:42,104
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You know how to play this?

976
00:58:43,713 --> 00:58:46,180
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Come on. Let me show you.

977
00:58:47,718 --> 00:58:50,151
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now, the secret to this game is

978
00:58:50,221 --> 00:58:52,151
{\fnTahoma\fs13}no matter what happens,

979
00:58:52,224 --> 00:58:54,657
{\fnTahoma\fs13}never, ever...

980
00:58:54,729 --> 00:58:56,819
{\fnTahoma\fs13}take your eye off the ball.

981
00:58:59,737 --> 00:59:00,997
{\fnTahoma\fs13}All right.

982
00:59:04,244 --> 00:59:05,674
{\fnTahoma\fs13}For some reason,

983
00:59:05,746 --> 00:59:08,179
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Ping-Pong came very natural to me.

984
00:59:08,249 --> 00:59:09,407
{\fnTahoma\fs13}See?

985
00:59:09,484 --> 00:59:11,677
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Any idiot can play.

986
00:59:11,755 --> 00:59:15,190
{\fnTahoma\fs13}So I started playing it
all the time.

987
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:16,886
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I played Ping-Pong

988
00:59:16,962 --> 00:59:20,556
{\fnTahoma\fs13}even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.

989
00:59:28,913 --> 00:59:30,343
{\fnTahoma\fs13}The hospital's people

990
00:59:30,417 --> 00:59:34,350
{\fnTahoma\fs13}said it made me look
like a duck in water...

991
00:59:34,422 --> 00:59:35,852
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Whatever that means.

992
00:59:35,924 --> 00:59:39,153
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Even Lieutenant Dan
would come and watch me play.

993
00:59:43,894 --> 00:59:46,327
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I played Ping-Pong so much,

994
00:59:46,396 --> 00:59:49,226
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I even played it in my sleep.

995
00:59:56,345 --> 00:59:57,273
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now...

996
00:59:57,347 --> 00:59:58,777
{\fnTahoma\fs13}you listen to me.

997
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:00,780
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We all have a destiny.

998
01:00:00,852 --> 01:00:04,287
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Nothing just happens.
It's all part of a plan!

999
01:00:04,359 --> 01:00:07,348
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I should have died
out there with my men,

1000
01:00:07,429 --> 01:00:11,420
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but now... I'm nothing
but a god damn cripple,

1001
01:00:11,501 --> 01:00:13,193
{\fnTahoma\fs13}a legless freak!

1002
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:15,360
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Look. Look! Look at me!

1003
01:00:15,441 --> 01:00:16,871
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You see that?

1004
01:00:16,944 --> 01:00:18,806
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Do you know what it's like

1005
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,869
{\fnTahoma\fs13}not to be able to use your legs?

1006
01:00:23,887 --> 01:00:25,942
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Y-Y -Yes, sir, I do.

1007
01:00:29,396 --> 01:00:32,157
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Did you hear what I said?

1008
01:00:32,233 --> 01:00:34,095
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You cheated me!

1009
01:00:34,169 --> 01:00:35,599
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I had a destiny.

1010
01:00:35,671 --> 01:00:38,194
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I was supposed
to die in the field

1011
01:00:38,274 --> 01:00:39,466
{\fnTahoma\fs13}with honor!

1012
01:00:39,543 --> 01:00:41,269
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That was my destiny,

1013
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:44,312
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and you...
cheated me out of it!

1014
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:55,227
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You understand
what I'm saying, Gump?

1015
01:00:57,704 --> 01:01:00,795
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This wasn't supposed
to happen...

1016
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:02,670
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Not to me.

1017
01:01:04,214 --> 01:01:05,736
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I had a destiny.

1018
01:01:07,721 --> 01:01:09,311
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I was...

1019
01:01:09,388 --> 01:01:11,148
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Lieutenant...

1020
01:01:11,225 --> 01:01:12,951
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Dan Taylor.

1021
01:01:17,834 --> 01:01:19,764
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Y-You still

1022
01:01:19,837 --> 01:01:21,495
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Lieutenant Dan.

1023
01:01:43,873 --> 01:01:45,303
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Look at me.

1024
01:01:46,877 --> 01:01:49,310
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What am I going to do now?

1025
01:01:51,885 --> 01:01:54,680
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What am I going to do now?

1026
01:02:04,405 --> 01:02:06,030
{\fnTahoma\fs13}PFC Gump?

1027
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:09,636
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yes, sir!

1028
01:02:09,712 --> 01:02:11,108
{\fnTahoma\fs13}As you were.

1029
01:02:12,248 --> 01:02:13,336
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Son,

1030
01:02:13,417 --> 01:02:15,875
{\fnTahoma\fs13}you been awarded
the Medal of Honor.

1031
01:02:16,011 --> 01:02:18,240
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Guess what, Lieutenant Dan?

1032
01:02:18,314 --> 01:02:21,042
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They want to give me a med...

1033
01:02:26,828 --> 01:02:28,758
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Ma'am.

1034
01:02:28,831 --> 01:02:31,264
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What did they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

1035
01:02:31,334 --> 01:02:33,196
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They sent him home.

1036
01:02:39,846 --> 01:02:43,213
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Two weeks later,
I left Vietnam.

1037
01:02:43,286 --> 01:02:44,774
{\fnTahoma\fs13}The ceremony was kicked off

1038
01:02:44,855 --> 01:02:46,945
{\fnTahoma\fs13}with a can did speech
by the president

1039
01:02:47,025 --> 01:02:51,462
{\fnTahoma\fs13}regarding the need for further
escalation of the war in Vietnam.

1040
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:55,463
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Johnson awarded 4 Medals of Honor to
men from each of the armed services.

1041
01:02:55,537 --> 01:02:57,434
{\fnTahoma\fs13}America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.

1042
01:02:59,377 --> 01:03:01,307
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I understand you were wounded.

1043
01:03:01,378 --> 01:03:03,308
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Where were you hit?

1044
01:03:03,383 --> 01:03:04,973
{\fnTahoma\fs13}In the but-tocks, sir.

1045
01:03:05,051 --> 01:03:06,981
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well, that must be a sight.

1046
01:03:07,054 --> 01:03:09,815
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'd kinda like to see that.

1047
01:03:09,893 --> 01:03:13,657
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# And here's to you,
Mrs. Robinson #

1048
01:03:13,732 --> 01:03:16,790
{\fnTahoma\fs13}#Jesus loves you more
than you will know #

1049
01:03:20,441 --> 01:03:23,773
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# God bless you, please,
Mrs. Robinson #

1050
01:03:23,847 --> 01:03:25,505
{\fnTahoma\fs13}God damn, son!

1051
01:03:27,352 --> 01:03:30,787
{\fnTahoma\fs13}After that, Mama went
to the hotel to lay down,

1052
01:03:30,857 --> 01:03:34,790
{\fnTahoma\fs13}so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.

1053
01:03:34,863 --> 01:03:36,793
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hilary! I got the vets.

1054
01:03:36,866 --> 01:03:39,661
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What do you want
to do with them?

1055
01:03:39,737 --> 01:03:42,295
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's a good thing
Mama was resting,

1056
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:45,307
{\fnTahoma\fs13}'cause the streets
was awful crowded with people

1057
01:03:45,378 --> 01:03:48,310
{\fnTahoma\fs13}lookin'at all the statues
and monuments,

1058
01:03:48,383 --> 01:03:51,315
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and some of them people
were loud and pushy.

1059
01:03:51,388 --> 01:03:53,216
{\fnTahoma\fs13}O.K., follow me!

1060
01:03:53,292 --> 01:03:56,590
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.

1061
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:04,459
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Come on.

1062
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:05,524
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Go!

1063
01:04:14,421 --> 01:04:17,788
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, you're a good man
for doing this.

1064
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:19,222
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Good.

1065
01:04:19,296 --> 01:04:20,784
{\fnTahoma\fs13}O.K.

1066
01:04:20,865 --> 01:04:23,797
{\fnTahoma\fs13}There was this man
giving a little talk.

1067
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:25,300
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And for some reason,

1068
01:04:25,373 --> 01:04:28,305
{\fnTahoma\fs13}he was wearing
an American flag for a shirt.

1069
01:04:29,878 --> 01:04:33,811
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And he liked to say
the "F" word... a lot.

1070
01:04:33,884 --> 01:04:36,146
{\fnTahoma\fs13}"F" this and "F" that.

1071
01:04:36,221 --> 01:04:39,187
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And every time
he said the "F" word,

1072
01:04:39,259 --> 01:04:42,317
{\fnTahoma\fs13}people, for some reason,
well, they cheered.

1073
01:04:43,898 --> 01:04:46,558
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yeah! Yeah!

1074
01:04:48,038 --> 01:04:51,096
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Come on, man.
Come up here, man.

1075
01:04:51,176 --> 01:04:52,538
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Come on. Come on.

1076
01:04:52,613 --> 01:04:54,772
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move!

1077
01:04:56,417 --> 01:04:58,381
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Go on. Let's get up there.

1078
01:05:10,874 --> 01:05:13,898
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Tell us a little bit
about the war, man.

1079
01:05:13,979 --> 01:05:15,876
{\fnTahoma\fs13}The war in Vietnam?

1080
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:18,707
{\fnTahoma\fs13}The war in Viet-

1081
01:05:18,786 --> 01:05:20,342
{\fnTahoma\fs13}fucking-nam!

1082
01:05:44,422 --> 01:05:45,852
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well...

1083
01:05:45,925 --> 01:05:48,857
{\fnTahoma\fs13}There was only one thing
I could say

1084
01:05:48,931 --> 01:05:50,361
{\fnTahoma\fs13}about the war in Vietnam.

1085
01:05:50,432 --> 01:05:53,364
{\fnTahoma\fs13}There's only one thing
I can say about...

1086
01:05:53,436 --> 01:05:54,924
{\fnTahoma\fs13}the war in Vietnam.

1087
01:05:58,443 --> 01:06:00,305
{\fnTahoma\fs13}In Vietnam...

1088
01:06:11,464 --> 01:06:13,394
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What the hell are you do...

1089
01:06:13,467 --> 01:06:16,399
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'll beat your head in,
you goddamn oinker!

1090
01:06:16,471 --> 01:06:18,904
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jesus Christ!
What did they do with this?

1091
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:20,940
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Can't hear you!

1092
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:24,842
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Can't hear anything!

1093
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,847
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This... This one!

1094
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:27,848
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Give me that!

1095
01:06:27,921 --> 01:06:30,479
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Speak up!

1096
01:06:33,195 --> 01:06:35,559
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And that's all I have to say

1097
01:06:35,632 --> 01:06:37,392
{\fnTahoma\fs13}about that.

1098
01:06:43,744 --> 01:06:45,937
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That's so right on, man.

1099
01:06:46,015 --> 01:06:47,480
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You said it all.

1100
01:06:49,018 --> 01:06:51,177
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What's your name, man?

1101
01:06:51,256 --> 01:06:54,691
{\fnTahoma\fs13}My name is Forrest.
Forrest Gump.

1102
01:06:54,762 --> 01:06:56,318
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest Gump.

1103
01:06:56,397 --> 01:06:57,657
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Gump! Gump!
Gump!

1104
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:01,234
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest!

1105
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:03,740
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest!

1106
01:07:07,151 --> 01:07:08,995
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny!

1107
01:07:09,065 --> 01:07:10,057
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest!

1108
01:07:37,044 --> 01:07:40,769
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It was the happiest
moment of my life.

1109
01:07:42,431 --> 01:07:46,222
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny and me were just like
peas and carrots again.

1110
01:07:46,293 --> 01:07:47,683
{\fnTahoma\fs13}She showed me around

1111
01:07:47,754 --> 01:07:50,746
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and even in troduced me
to some of her new friends.

1112
01:07:50,819 --> 01:07:52,280
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Shut that blind, man!

1113
01:07:52,355 --> 01:07:55,354
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And get your white ass
away from that window.

1114
01:07:55,427 --> 01:07:56,651
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Don't you know we in a war here?

1115
01:07:56,654 --> 01:07:57,733
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Don't you know we in a war here?

1116
01:07:57,814 --> 01:07:59,754
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He's cool.
He's one of us.

1117
01:07:59,831 --> 01:08:01,806
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Let me tell you about us.

1118
01:08:01,879 --> 01:08:04,878
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Our purpose here is
to protect our black leaders

1119
01:08:04,953 --> 01:08:07,476
{\fnTahoma\fs13}from the racial
on slaught of the pig

1120
01:08:07,546 --> 01:08:10,441
{\fnTahoma\fs13}who wishes to brutalize
our black leaders,

1121
01:08:10,516 --> 01:08:13,784
{\fnTahoma\fs13}rape our women, and destroy
our black communities.

1122
01:08:13,862 --> 01:08:15,290
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Who's the baby killer?

1123
01:08:15,367 --> 01:08:17,947
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This is my good friend
I told you about.

1124
01:08:18,009 --> 01:08:20,589
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This is Forrest Gump.
Forrest, this is Wesley.

1125
01:08:20,653 --> 01:08:22,793
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Wesley and I
lived together in Berkeley,

1126
01:08:22,856 --> 01:08:25,765
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

1127
01:08:25,837 --> 01:08:28,355
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We are here to offer
protection and help

1128
01:08:28,415 --> 01:08:30,504
{\fnTahoma\fs13}for all those
who need our help,

1129
01:08:30,566 --> 01:08:31,794
{\fnTahoma\fs13}because we,
the Black Panthers,

1130
01:08:31,855 --> 01:08:34,753
{\fnTahoma\fs13}are against the war in Vietnam.

1131
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:36,361
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We are against any war

1132
01:08:36,436 --> 01:08:38,070
{\fnTahoma\fs13}where black soldiers
are sent to the front line

1133
01:08:38,109 --> 01:08:40,850
{\fnTahoma\fs13}to die for a country
that hates them.

1134
01:08:40,918 --> 01:08:43,957
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

1135
01:08:44,012 --> 01:08:49,053
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and come to be brutalized and
killed in their own communities.

1136
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:51,741
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We are against
these racist and imperial acts...

1137
01:08:53,969 --> 01:08:56,974
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# And I gave her the gun #

1138
01:08:57,072 --> 01:08:59,093
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# I shot her #

1139
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:03,520
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest!

1140
01:09:03,617 --> 01:09:04,510
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Stop it!

1141
01:09:04,568 --> 01:09:05,684
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Stop it!

1142
01:09:06,497 --> 01:09:07,562
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest!

1143
01:09:07,627 --> 01:09:10,025
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Stop it! Stop it!

1144
01:09:18,841 --> 01:09:21,273
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I shouldn't have
brought you here.

1145
01:09:21,345 --> 01:09:26,042
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I should have known it was going
to be some bullshit hassle!

1146
01:09:26,117 --> 01:09:28,674
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He should not be
hitting you, Jenny.

1147
01:09:33,861 --> 01:09:35,688
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Come on, Forrest.

1148
01:09:40,803 --> 01:09:45,518
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

1149
01:09:47,346 --> 01:09:50,244
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He doesn't mean it
when he does things like this.

1150
01:09:50,314 --> 01:09:52,780
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I would never hurt you, Jenny.

1151
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:56,654
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I know you wouldn't,
Forrest.

1152
01:09:58,728 --> 01:10:01,421
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I wanted to be your boy friend.

1153
01:10:11,914 --> 01:10:14,073
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

1154
01:10:15,922 --> 01:10:17,784
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You look handsome in it.

1155
01:10:17,859 --> 01:10:19,586
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You do.

1156
01:10:22,866 --> 01:10:24,296
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You know what?

1157
01:10:24,366 --> 01:10:25,455
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What?

1158
01:10:27,872 --> 01:10:32,205
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

1159
01:10:33,714 --> 01:10:35,304
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Me, too, Forrest.

1160
01:10:35,384 --> 01:10:38,841
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We walked around
all night, Jenny and me,

1161
01:10:38,922 --> 01:10:40,853
{\fnTahoma\fs13}just talkin'.

1162
01:10:40,925 --> 01:10:45,691
{\fnTahoma\fs13}She told me about
all the traveling she'd done

1163
01:10:45,767 --> 01:10:49,633
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and how she discovered
ways to expand her mind

1164
01:10:49,707 --> 01:10:53,259
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and learn how
to live in harmony...

1165
01:10:53,395 --> 01:10:55,292
{\fnTahoma\fs13}which must be
out west somewhere,

1166
01:10:55,364 --> 01:10:58,297
{\fnTahoma\fs13}'cause she made it
all the way to California.

1167
01:10:58,369 --> 01:11:00,300
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Love one another right now #

1168
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:04,671
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Anybody want to go
to San Francisco?

1169
01:11:04,746 --> 01:11:06,211
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'll go.

1170
01:11:06,282 --> 01:11:07,610
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Far out!

1171
01:11:07,683 --> 01:11:10,115
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It was a very special night

1172
01:11:10,189 --> 01:11:11,882
{\fnTahoma\fs13}for the two of us.

1173
01:11:13,593 --> 01:11:15,524
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I didn't want it to end.

1174
01:11:16,697 --> 01:11:18,559
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

1175
01:11:19,835 --> 01:11:21,356
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I have to, Forrest.

1176
01:11:22,838 --> 01:11:23,766
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny?

1177
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:28,269
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Things got
a little out of hand.

1178
01:11:28,348 --> 01:11:29,938
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's just this war

1179
01:11:30,016 --> 01:11:32,776
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and that lying
son of a bitch Johnson and...

1180
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:37,054
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I would never hurt you.
You know that.

1181
01:11:39,865 --> 01:11:41,762
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Know what I think?

1182
01:11:43,772 --> 01:11:45,202
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I think...

1183
01:11:45,275 --> 01:11:47,297
{\fnTahoma\fs13}you should go home to Greenbow,

1184
01:11:47,377 --> 01:11:49,365
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Alabama!

1185
01:11:59,397 --> 01:12:00,759
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest,

1186
01:12:01,899 --> 01:12:04,524
{\fnTahoma\fs13}we have very
different lives, you know.

1187
01:12:13,417 --> 01:12:15,348
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I want you...

1188
01:12:15,421 --> 01:12:17,511
{\fnTahoma\fs13}to have this.

1189
01:12:21,364 --> 01:12:23,352
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest, I can't keep this.

1190
01:12:25,368 --> 01:12:26,798
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I got it...

1191
01:12:26,871 --> 01:12:30,203
{\fnTahoma\fs13}just by doing
what you told me to do.

1192
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:35,144
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Why are you so good to me?

1193
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:37,045
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You're my girl.

1194
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:40,883
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'll always be your girl.

1195
01:13:03,828 --> 01:13:08,787
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# To everything,
turn, turn, turn #

1196
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:13,364
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# There is a season,
turn, turn, turn #

1197
01:13:13,444 --> 01:13:17,208
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# And a time to every purpose #

1198
01:13:17,282 --> 01:13:19,304
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Under heaven #

1199
01:13:20,489 --> 01:13:23,320
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And just like that,

1200
01:13:23,397 --> 01:13:28,430
{\fnTahoma\fs13}she was gone
out of my life again.

1201
01:13:28,707 --> 01:13:30,954
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That's one small step for man,

1202
01:13:32,547 --> 01:13:34,987
{\fnTahoma\fs13}one giant leap for mankind.

1203
01:13:40,967 --> 01:13:42,165
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I thought I was
going back to Vietnam,

1204
01:13:43,602 --> 01:13:44,911
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but instead they decided

1205
01:13:44,923 --> 01:13:47,125
{\fnTahoma\fs13}the best way for me
to fight the Communists

1206
01:13:47,131 --> 01:13:49,079
{\fnTahoma\fs13}was to play Ping-Pong,

1207
01:13:49,088 --> 01:13:51,303
{\fnTahoma\fs13}so I was in the special Services,

1208
01:13:51,332 --> 01:13:52,836
{\fnTahoma\fs13}traveling around the country,

1209
01:13:52,932 --> 01:13:55,583
{\fnTahoma\fs13}cheering up wounded veterans
and showing'em

1210
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:56,979
{\fnTahoma\fs13}how to play Ping-Pong.

1211
01:13:57,326 --> 01:13:58,221
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I was so good
that some years later,

1212
01:13:58,293 --> 01:14:00,301
{\fnTahoma\fs13}the army decided I should be

1213
01:14:00,378 --> 01:14:02,663
{\fnTahoma\fs13}on the all-American Ping-Pong team.

1214
01:14:02,746 --> 01:14:06,201
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We were the first Americans
to visit the land of China

1215
01:14:06,279 --> 01:14:08,817
{\fnTahoma\fs13}in a million years or something.

1216
01:14:08,895 --> 01:14:12,001
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Somebody said world peace
was in our hands,

1217
01:14:12,074 --> 01:14:14,927
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but all I did was play Ping-Pong.

1218
01:14:15,008 --> 01:14:18,041
{\fnTahoma\fs13}When I got home,
I was a national celebrity,

1219
01:14:18,117 --> 01:14:20,014
{\fnTahoma\fs13}famouser even
than Captain Kangaroo.

1220
01:14:21,053 --> 01:14:22,984
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Here he is, Forrest Gump.

1221
01:14:23,056 --> 01:14:24,419
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Right here.

1222
01:14:30,263 --> 01:14:33,231
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Gump, have a seat.

1223
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:36,062
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest Gump, John Lennon.

1224
01:14:36,137 --> 01:14:38,068
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Welcome home.

1225
01:14:38,138 --> 01:14:40,069
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Can you tell us, um,

1226
01:14:40,141 --> 01:14:42,265
{\fnTahoma\fs13}what was China like?

1227
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:47,570
{\fnTahoma\fs13}In the land of China...

1228
01:14:47,652 --> 01:14:49,583
{\fnTahoma\fs13}people hardly got nothin'at all.

1229
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:51,811
{\fnTahoma\fs13}No possessions?

1230
01:14:54,293 --> 01:14:59,091
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And in China,
they never go to church.

1231
01:14:59,165 --> 01:15:00,596
{\fnTahoma\fs13}No religion, too?

1232
01:15:02,669 --> 01:15:04,258
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hard to imagine.

1233
01:15:04,337 --> 01:15:07,600
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.

1234
01:15:07,676 --> 01:15:09,107
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Some years later,

1235
01:15:09,177 --> 01:15:11,108
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that nice young man from England

1236
01:15:11,179 --> 01:15:14,147
{\fnTahoma\fs13}was on his way home
to see his little boy

1237
01:15:14,217 --> 01:15:16,114
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and was signing some autographs.

1238
01:15:16,185 --> 01:15:18,047
{\fnTahoma\fs13}For no particular reason at all,

1239
01:15:18,122 --> 01:15:20,587
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Somebody shot him.

1240
01:15:23,128 --> 01:15:25,059
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They gave you...

1241
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:27,119
{\fnTahoma\fs13}the congressional Medal of Honor.

1242
01:15:28,534 --> 01:15:30,328
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.

1243
01:15:33,272 --> 01:15:34,861
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Lieutenant Dan!

1244
01:15:34,942 --> 01:15:36,804
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They gave you...

1245
01:15:36,877 --> 01:15:39,902
{\fnTahoma\fs13}the congressional
Medal of Honor.

1246
01:15:41,149 --> 01:15:43,080
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yes, sir.
They surely did.

1247
01:15:43,151 --> 01:15:44,979
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They gave you,

1248
01:15:45,052 --> 01:15:46,573
{\fnTahoma\fs13}an imbecile,

1249
01:15:46,655 --> 01:15:48,586
{\fnTahoma\fs13}a moron who goes on television

1250
01:15:48,657 --> 01:15:51,088
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and makes a fool out of himself

1251
01:15:51,161 --> 01:15:54,129
{\fnTahoma\fs13}in front of
the whole damn country,

1252
01:15:54,197 --> 01:15:56,526
{\fnTahoma\fs13}the Congressional
Medal of Honor.

1253
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:58,899
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yes, sir.

1254
01:16:01,174 --> 01:16:04,403
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well... that...
that's just perfect!

1255
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:08,170
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yeah, well, I just got
one thing to say to that...

1256
01:16:08,247 --> 01:16:10,611
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Goddamn bless America.

1257
01:16:14,288 --> 01:16:16,947
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Oh, God, whoa!

1258
01:16:17,026 --> 01:16:19,788
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Ow! Oh! Oh, God!

1259
01:16:19,862 --> 01:16:21,486
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Lieutenant Dan!

1260
01:16:21,564 --> 01:16:24,555
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Lieutenant Dan said
he was living in a hotel

1261
01:16:24,633 --> 01:16:27,567
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and because he didn't
have no legs,

1262
01:16:27,637 --> 01:16:30,571
{\fnTahoma\fs13}he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.

1263
01:16:32,678 --> 01:16:34,575
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Make a right. Take a right!

1264
01:16:39,919 --> 01:16:43,579
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What do you do here
in New York, Lieutenant Dan?

1265
01:16:43,657 --> 01:16:46,088
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm living off
the government tit.

1266
01:16:49,531 --> 01:16:51,587
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, hey, hey, are you blind?

1267
01:16:51,667 --> 01:16:53,098
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm walking here!

1268
01:16:53,169 --> 01:16:54,600
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Ah, get out!

1269
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:56,328
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Come on. Go, go, go!

1270
01:17:02,013 --> 01:17:04,103
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I stayed with Lieutenant Dan

1271
01:17:04,182 --> 01:17:06,511
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and celebrated the holidays.

1272
01:17:10,489 --> 01:17:13,183
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You have a great year,
and hurry home.

1273
01:17:13,259 --> 01:17:14,951
{\fnTahoma\fs13}God bless you.

1274
01:17:17,197 --> 01:17:20,323
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Have you found
Jesus yet, Gump?

1275
01:17:21,769 --> 01:17:25,634
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I didn't know I was supposed
to be looking for Him, sir.

1276
01:17:31,649 --> 01:17:35,105
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That's all these cripples
down at the V. A...

1277
01:17:35,186 --> 01:17:38,585
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That's all they ever
talk about.

1278
01:17:38,658 --> 01:17:42,888
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jesus this
and Jesus that. Ha.

1279
01:17:42,961 --> 01:17:46,451
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Have I... found Jesus?

1280
01:17:46,533 --> 01:17:49,967
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They even had a priest
come and talk to me.

1281
01:17:50,036 --> 01:17:52,592
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He said God is listening,

1282
01:17:52,673 --> 01:17:55,607
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but I have to help myself.

1283
01:17:55,678 --> 01:17:58,612
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now, if I accept Jesus
into my heart,

1284
01:17:58,681 --> 01:18:03,116
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'll get to walk beside Him
in the kingdom of heaven.

1285
01:18:03,185 --> 01:18:05,412
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Did you hear what I said?

1286
01:18:06,692 --> 01:18:08,486
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Walk...

1287
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:11,114
{\fnTahoma\fs13}beside Him
in the kingdom of heaven.

1288
01:18:11,195 --> 01:18:13,626
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well... kiss my crippled ass.

1289
01:18:13,699 --> 01:18:15,630
{\fnTahoma\fs13}God is listening?

1290
01:18:15,702 --> 01:18:17,758
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What a crock of shit.

1291
01:18:20,708 --> 01:18:23,196
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm going to heaven,
Lieutenant Dan.

1292
01:18:25,714 --> 01:18:26,643
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Oh?

1293
01:18:31,221 --> 01:18:32,446
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well...

1294
01:18:35,057 --> 01:18:36,578
{\fnTahoma\fs13}before you go...
why don't you

1295
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:39,078
{\fnTahoma\fs13}get your ass
down to the corner

1296
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:40,872
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and get us more Ripple?

1297
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:41,970
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yes, sir.

1298
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,482
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We're at approximately

1299
01:18:43,553 --> 01:18:46,645
{\fnTahoma\fs13}45th Street in New York City
at One Astor Plaza.

1300
01:18:46,724 --> 01:18:48,655
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This is the site of the old...

1301
01:18:48,727 --> 01:18:51,158
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What the hell is
in Bayou La Batre?

1302
01:18:51,228 --> 01:18:52,659
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Shrimping boats.

1303
01:18:52,732 --> 01:18:56,166
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Shrimping boats? Who gives
a shit about shrimping boats?

1304
01:18:56,235 --> 01:18:58,166
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I got to buy me one

1305
01:18:58,238 --> 01:19:00,169
{\fnTahoma\fs13}soon as I have some money.

1306
01:19:00,241 --> 01:19:01,672
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I promised Bubba in Vietnam

1307
01:19:01,741 --> 01:19:05,175
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that as soon as the war
was over, we'd be partners.

1308
01:19:05,245 --> 01:19:08,679
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He'd be the captain
and I'd be his first mate.

1309
01:19:08,751 --> 01:19:11,685
{\fnTahoma\fs13}But now that he's dead,
I got to be the captain.

1310
01:19:11,754 --> 01:19:13,685
{\fnTahoma\fs13}A shrimp boat captain.

1311
01:19:13,757 --> 01:19:16,849
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yes, sir. A promise
is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.

1312
01:19:19,196 --> 01:19:21,127
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now hear this!

1313
01:19:21,197 --> 01:19:22,628
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Private Gump here

1314
01:19:22,701 --> 01:19:25,132
{\fnTahoma\fs13}is gonna be
a shrimp boat captain.

1315
01:19:25,204 --> 01:19:27,135
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well, I tell you what, Gilligan.

1316
01:19:27,206 --> 01:19:30,140
{\fnTahoma\fs13}The day that you are
a shrimp boat captain,

1317
01:19:30,209 --> 01:19:33,143
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I will come and be
your first mate.

1318
01:19:34,714 --> 01:19:37,648
{\fnTahoma\fs13}If you're ever
a shrimp boat captain,

1319
01:19:37,717 --> 01:19:39,648
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that's the day
I'm an astronaut!

1320
01:19:39,721 --> 01:19:41,652
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Danny, what are you
complaining about?

1321
01:19:41,723 --> 01:19:43,154
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Danny, how you doing, huh?

1322
01:19:43,223 --> 01:19:44,654
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mr. Hot Wheels!

1323
01:19:44,726 --> 01:19:46,157
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Who's your friend?

1324
01:19:46,229 --> 01:19:48,694
{\fnTahoma\fs13}My name is Forrest.
Forrest Gump.

1325
01:19:48,765 --> 01:19:51,196
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This is cunning Carla

1326
01:19:51,266 --> 01:19:53,197
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and long-limbs Lenore.

1327
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:55,167
{\fnTahoma\fs13}So where you been,
baby cakes, huh?

1328
01:19:55,239 --> 01:19:57,170
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Haven't seen you
around lately.

1329
01:19:57,242 --> 01:19:59,673
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You should have been here
for Christmas,

1330
01:19:59,746 --> 01:20:01,677
{\fnTahoma\fs13}'cause Tommy bought a free round

1331
01:20:01,746 --> 01:20:03,677
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and gave everybody
a turkey sandwich.

1332
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:05,681
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well, well,
I had, uh... company.

1333
01:20:05,752 --> 01:20:07,683
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey! Hey, we was just there!

1334
01:20:07,754 --> 01:20:09,685
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That's like Times Square.

1335
01:20:09,756 --> 01:20:12,187
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Don't you just love New Year's?

1336
01:20:12,259 --> 01:20:14,690
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You can start all over.

1337
01:20:14,763 --> 01:20:16,694
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Everybody gets a second chance.

1338
01:20:16,766 --> 01:20:18,129
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's funny...

1339
01:20:18,199 --> 01:20:21,133
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but in the middle
of all that fun,

1340
01:20:21,203 --> 01:20:23,031
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I began to think about Jenny,

1341
01:20:23,105 --> 01:20:26,539
{\fnTahoma\fs13}wondering how she was
spending her New Year's night

1342
01:20:26,611 --> 01:20:29,270
{\fnTahoma\fs13}out in California.

1343
01:20:29,347 --> 01:20:32,644
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Don't you love her ways? #

1344
01:20:32,717 --> 01:20:35,809
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Tell me what you say #

1345
01:20:35,886 --> 01:20:38,978
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Don't you love her madly? #

1346
01:20:39,059 --> 01:20:42,151
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Want to meet her daddy? #

1347
01:20:42,229 --> 01:20:45,287
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Don't you love her face? #

1348
01:20:45,367 --> 01:20:50,165
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Don't you love her
as she's walkin' out the door? #

1349
01:20:50,238 --> 01:20:51,669
{\fnTahoma\fs13}9... 8...

1350
01:20:51,741 --> 01:20:53,672
{\fnTahoma\fs13}7... 6...

1351
01:20:53,743 --> 01:20:55,674
{\fnTahoma\fs13}5... 4...

1352
01:20:55,744 --> 01:20:57,209
{\fnTahoma\fs13}3... 2...

1353
01:20:57,282 --> 01:20:58,211
{\fnTahoma\fs13}1!

1354
01:20:58,281 --> 01:21:00,473
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Happy new year!

1355
01:21:10,262 --> 01:21:14,196
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Should auld acquaintance
be forgot #

1356
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:17,203
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# And never brought to mind? #

1357
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:20,137
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Happy new year, Lieutenant Dan!

1358
01:21:20,207 --> 01:21:24,903
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Should auld acquaintance
be forgot #

1359
01:21:24,979 --> 01:21:29,937
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# In days of auld lang syne! #

1360
01:21:38,996 --> 01:21:40,551
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Together we stand #

1361
01:21:40,633 --> 01:21:43,292
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Divided we fall #

1362
01:21:43,368 --> 01:21:45,458
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Come on now, people, let's #

1363
01:21:45,538 --> 01:21:46,467
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Get on the ball #

1364
01:21:46,539 --> 01:21:48,766
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# And work together #

1365
01:21:48,842 --> 01:21:50,568
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Come on, come on #

1366
01:21:50,644 --> 01:21:52,302
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Let's work together #

1367
01:21:54,749 --> 01:21:57,180
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Oh! What are you,
stupid or something?

1368
01:21:57,252 --> 01:21:58,683
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What's your problem?

1369
01:21:58,754 --> 01:22:00,185
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What's his problem?

1370
01:22:00,257 --> 01:22:03,191
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Did you lose your packet
in the war or something?

1371
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:05,191
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Is your friend
stupid or something?

1372
01:22:05,262 --> 01:22:06,693
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What did you say?

1373
01:22:06,763 --> 01:22:09,194
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I said is your friend
stupid or something?

1374
01:22:09,267 --> 01:22:10,526
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Don't call him stupid!

1375
01:22:10,601 --> 01:22:12,032
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, don't push her!

1376
01:22:12,104 --> 01:22:13,125
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You shut up!

1377
01:22:13,204 --> 01:22:15,101
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Don't you ever call him stupid!

1378
01:22:15,174 --> 01:22:17,503
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Come on, baby,
why you being so upset, huh?

1379
01:22:17,577 --> 01:22:18,734
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Get your goddamned clothes

1380
01:22:18,812 --> 01:22:21,243
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and get the hell out of here!

1381
01:22:21,314 --> 01:22:23,142
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You should be in a sideshow.

1382
01:22:23,216 --> 01:22:24,339
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You're so pathetic!

1383
01:22:24,417 --> 01:22:25,905
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Get out of here!

1384
01:22:25,988 --> 01:22:27,419
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You big guy!

1385
01:22:27,488 --> 01:22:29,454
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Loser. You freak!

1386
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:35,888
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Oh, no. No.

1387
01:23:00,763 --> 01:23:02,191
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm sorry I ruined

1388
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:05,190
{\fnTahoma\fs13}your New Year's Eve party,
Lieutenant Dan.

1389
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:07,585
{\fnTahoma\fs13}She tastes like cigarettes.

1390
01:23:23,683 --> 01:23:25,611
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I guess Lieutenant Dan figured

1391
01:23:25,682 --> 01:23:28,612
{\fnTahoma\fs13}there's some things
you just can't change.

1392
01:23:28,681 --> 01:23:31,611
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He didn't want
to be called crippled

1393
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:35,107
{\fnTahoma\fs13}just like I didn't
want to be called stupid.

1394
01:23:39,176 --> 01:23:41,297
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Happy new year, Gump.

1395
01:23:46,039 --> 01:23:47,591
{\fnTahoma\fs13}The U.S. Ping-Pong team

1396
01:23:47,672 --> 01:23:49,100
{\fnTahoma\fs13}met with President Nixon today...

1397
01:23:49,171 --> 01:23:50,792
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Wouldn't you know it?

1398
01:23:50,870 --> 01:23:52,593
{\fnTahoma\fs13}A few months later,

1399
01:23:52,669 --> 01:23:55,599
{\fnTahoma\fs13}they invited me
and the Ping-Pong team

1400
01:23:55,667 --> 01:23:57,095
{\fnTahoma\fs13}to visit the White House.

1401
01:23:57,167 --> 01:23:58,561
{\fnTahoma\fs13}So I went...

1402
01:23:58,633 --> 01:23:59,788
{\fnTahoma\fs13}again.

1403
01:23:59,866 --> 01:24:03,657
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And I met the president
of the United States again.

1404
01:24:03,731 --> 01:24:06,283
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Only this time,
they didn't get us rooms

1405
01:24:06,363 --> 01:24:08,086
{\fnTahoma\fs13}in a real fancy hotel.

1406
01:24:08,161 --> 01:24:09,589
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Are you enjoying yourself

1407
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:11,588
{\fnTahoma\fs13}in our nation's capital,
young man?

1408
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:13,088
{\fnTahoma\fs13}where are you staying?

1409
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:14,588
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's called the Hotel Ebbott.

1410
01:24:14,658 --> 01:24:17,588
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Oh, no, no, no.
I know a much nicer hotel.

1411
01:24:17,656 --> 01:24:19,016
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's brand-new. Very modern.

1412
01:24:19,091 --> 01:24:21,711
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'll have my people
take care of it.

1413
01:24:21,788 --> 01:24:23,011
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Security.

1414
01:24:23,088 --> 01:24:24,516
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yeah. Sir,

1415
01:24:24,588 --> 01:24:27,518
{\fnTahoma\fs13}you might want to send
a maintenance man

1416
01:24:27,586 --> 01:24:30,013
{\fnTahoma\fs13}over to that office
across the way.

1417
01:24:30,083 --> 01:24:31,511
{\fnTahoma\fs13}The lights are off

1418
01:24:31,584 --> 01:24:34,514
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and they must be looking
for a fuse box,

1419
01:24:34,582 --> 01:24:37,512
{\fnTahoma\fs13}'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

1420
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:39,508
{\fnTahoma\fs13}O.K., sir.
I'll check it out.

1421
01:24:39,579 --> 01:24:40,871
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Thank you. Good night.

1422
01:24:44,078 --> 01:24:45,506
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Therefore...

1423
01:24:45,577 --> 01:24:47,505
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I shall resign the presidency

1424
01:24:47,575 --> 01:24:49,833
{\fnTahoma\fs13}effective at noon tomorrow.

1425
01:24:49,908 --> 01:24:51,836
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Vice President Ford

1426
01:24:51,907 --> 01:24:53,994
{\fnTahoma\fs13}will be sworn in as president

1427
01:24:54,073 --> 01:24:56,727
{\fnTahoma\fs13}at that hour in this office.

1428
01:25:07,833 --> 01:25:09,295
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest Gump.

1429
01:25:09,366 --> 01:25:10,987
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yes, sir!

1430
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:12,492
{\fnTahoma\fs13}As you were.

1431
01:25:12,564 --> 01:25:14,492
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I have your discharge papers.

1432
01:25:14,561 --> 01:25:16,216
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Service is up, son.

1433
01:25:18,494 --> 01:25:21,785
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Does this mean I can't
play Ping-Pong no more?

1434
01:25:21,858 --> 01:25:23,821
{\fnTahoma\fs13}For the army, it does.

1435
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:27,918
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And just like that,

1436
01:25:27,989 --> 01:25:31,417
{\fnTahoma\fs13}my service in
the United States Army was over.

1437
01:25:35,984 --> 01:25:37,947
{\fnTahoma\fs13}So I went home.

1438
01:25:59,607 --> 01:26:01,126
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm home, Mama.

1439
01:26:01,207 --> 01:26:03,600
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I know. I know.

1440
01:26:04,970 --> 01:26:06,398
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Louise, he's here.

1441
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:09,400
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now, when I got home,
I had no idea,

1442
01:26:09,469 --> 01:26:11,896
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but Mama had all sorts
of visitors.

1443
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:13,896
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We've had all sorts of visitors.

1444
01:26:13,967 --> 01:26:17,395
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Everybody wants you
to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

1445
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:20,324
{\fnTahoma\fs13}One man even left
a check for $25,000

1446
01:26:20,397 --> 01:26:23,825
{\fnTahoma\fs13}if you'd be agree able to saying
you like using their paddle.

1447
01:26:23,896 --> 01:26:26,826
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I only like using
my own paddle.

1448
01:26:26,894 --> 01:26:28,288
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hi, Miss Louise.

1449
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:29,346
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, Forrest.

1450
01:26:29,426 --> 01:26:32,321
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I know that,
but it's $25,000, Forrest.

1451
01:26:32,391 --> 01:26:35,819
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I thought maybe
you could hold it for a while,

1452
01:26:35,889 --> 01:26:38,316
{\fnTahoma\fs13}see if it grows on you.

1453
01:26:38,389 --> 01:26:40,317
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That Mama, she sure was right.

1454
01:26:40,388 --> 01:26:43,075
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's funny how things work out.

1455
01:26:43,212 --> 01:26:45,106
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I didn't stay home for long

1456
01:26:45,177 --> 01:26:47,604
{\fnTahoma\fs13}because I'd made
apromise to Bubba,

1457
01:26:47,676 --> 01:26:50,103
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and I always try
to keep my promise,

1458
01:26:50,175 --> 01:26:52,602
{\fnTahoma\fs13}so I went on down
to Bayou La Batre

1459
01:26:52,674 --> 01:26:54,159
{\fnTahoma\fs13}to meet Bubba's family.

1460
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:58,631
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Are you crazy
or just plain stupid?

1461
01:26:58,705 --> 01:27:01,928
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Stupid is as stupid does,
Mrs. Blue.

1462
01:27:02,002 --> 01:27:02,930
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I guess.

1463
01:27:03,002 --> 01:27:04,430
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And, of course,

1464
01:27:04,501 --> 01:27:07,588
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I paid my respect
to Bubba himself.

1465
01:27:08,832 --> 01:27:11,486
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, Bubba.
It's me, Forrest Gump.

1466
01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:16,758
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I remember everything
you said,

1467
01:27:16,829 --> 01:27:19,689
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and I got it
all figured out.

1468
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:27,979
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm taking $24,562.47

1469
01:27:28,056 --> 01:27:30,177
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that I got, that's left

1470
01:27:30,256 --> 01:27:32,683
{\fnTahoma\fs13}after a new hair cut
and a new suit

1471
01:27:32,754 --> 01:27:35,684
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,

1472
01:27:35,752 --> 01:27:38,612
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and I bought a bus ticket,
then three Dr. Peppers.

1473
01:27:38,684 --> 01:27:40,670
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Tell me something.

1474
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:43,177
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Are you stupid or something?

1475
01:27:43,249 --> 01:27:45,937
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1476
01:27:46,015 --> 01:27:47,943
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That's what's left
after me saying,

1477
01:27:48,014 --> 01:27:51,942
{\fnTahoma\fs13}"When I was in China on
the all-America Ping-Pong team,

1478
01:27:52,011 --> 01:27:53,939
{\fnTahoma\fs13}"I just loved
playing Ping-Pong

1479
01:27:54,011 --> 01:27:56,132
{\fnTahoma\fs13}with my Flex-O-Lite
Ping-Pong paddle,"

1480
01:27:56,208 --> 01:27:58,136
{\fnTahoma\fs13}which everybody knows isn't true,

1481
01:27:58,207 --> 01:28:01,137
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but Mama said it was just
a little white lie,

1482
01:28:01,206 --> 01:28:03,134
{\fnTahoma\fs13}so it wasn't hurting nobody.

1483
01:28:03,206 --> 01:28:05,633
{\fnTahoma\fs13}So anyway,
I'm putting all that

1484
01:28:05,705 --> 01:28:08,132
{\fnTahoma\fs13}on gas, ropes, and new nets

1485
01:28:08,204 --> 01:28:11,134
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1486
01:28:32,226 --> 01:28:35,654
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now Bubba told me everything
he knew about shrimping,

1487
01:28:35,722 --> 01:28:38,652
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but you know what I found out?

1488
01:28:39,722 --> 01:28:42,274
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Shrimping is tough.

1489
01:28:44,219 --> 01:28:46,873
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I only caught five.

1490
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:50,378
{\fnTahoma\fs13}A couple more,
you can have yourself a cocktail.

1491
01:28:52,214 --> 01:28:55,144
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, you ever think about
naming this old boat?

1492
01:28:55,213 --> 01:28:58,143
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's bad luck to have
a boat without a name.

1493
01:28:58,211 --> 01:29:00,638
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'd never named a boat before,

1494
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:05,728
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but there was only one
I could think of,

1495
01:29:05,808 --> 01:29:09,759
{\fnTahoma\fs13}the most beautiful name
in the wide world.

1496
01:29:13,838 --> 01:29:15,323
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Do a little dance #

1497
01:29:15,403 --> 01:29:17,366
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Make a little love #

1498
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:19,363
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Get down tonight#

1499
01:29:19,434 --> 01:29:21,725
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Get down tonight#

1500
01:29:21,801 --> 01:29:23,989
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Do a little dance #

1501
01:29:24,066 --> 01:29:25,823
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Make a little love #

1502
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:27,521
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Get down tonight#

1503
01:29:28,764 --> 01:29:30,056
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Get down tonight... #

1504
01:29:30,129 --> 01:29:32,522
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny

1505
01:29:32,594 --> 01:29:33,886
{\fnTahoma\fs13}in a long while,

1506
01:29:33,961 --> 01:29:36,388
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but I thought about her a lot.

1507
01:29:36,461 --> 01:29:39,548
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I hoped whatever
she was doing made her happy.

1508
01:29:39,627 --> 01:29:44,645
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Oh, and the bird
you cannot change #

1509
01:29:48,088 --> 01:29:54,775
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# And this bird
you cannot change #

1510
01:29:54,852 --> 01:30:02,221
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Lord knows I can't change #

1511
01:30:02,293 --> 01:30:09,224
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Lord, help me, I can't change #

1512
01:31:25,442 --> 01:31:28,878
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I thought about Jenny all the time.

1513
01:32:18,675 --> 01:32:23,271
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?

1514
01:32:23,346 --> 01:32:26,713
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well, thought
I'd try out my sea legs.

1515
01:32:26,784 --> 01:32:29,719
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well, you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.

1516
01:32:29,787 --> 01:32:31,220
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yes, I know that.

1517
01:32:31,289 --> 01:32:35,487
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You wrote me a letter,
you idiot.

1518
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:37,926
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well, well.
Captain Forrest Gump.

1519
01:32:37,997 --> 01:32:40,864
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I had to see this for myself...

1520
01:32:42,168 --> 01:32:43,635
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and...

1521
01:32:43,704 --> 01:32:48,141
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I told you if you were ever
a shrimp boat captain,

1522
01:32:48,208 --> 01:32:50,142
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that I'd be your first mate.

1523
01:32:50,211 --> 01:32:51,872
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well, here I am.

1524
01:32:51,946 --> 01:32:53,880
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm a man of my word.

1525
01:32:53,948 --> 01:32:54,972
{\fnTahoma\fs13}O.K.

1526
01:32:55,050 --> 01:32:57,211
{\fnTahoma\fs13}But don't you be thinking

1527
01:32:57,286 --> 01:32:59,720
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that I'm going
to be calling you "sir."

1528
01:32:59,788 --> 01:33:00,720
{\fnTahoma\fs13}No, sir.

1529
01:33:09,267 --> 01:33:10,791
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's my boat.

1530
01:33:13,972 --> 01:33:18,068
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I have a feeling
if we head due east,

1531
01:33:18,143 --> 01:33:21,704
{\fnTahoma\fs13}we'll find some shrimp,
so take a left.

1532
01:33:23,116 --> 01:33:24,549
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Take a left!

1533
01:33:24,617 --> 01:33:25,549
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Which way?

1534
01:33:25,619 --> 01:33:26,551
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Over there!

1535
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:28,053
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They're over there!

1536
01:33:28,122 --> 01:33:31,455
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Get on the wheel
and take a left.

1537
01:33:31,526 --> 01:33:32,959
{\fnTahoma\fs13}O.K.

1538
01:33:34,296 --> 01:33:36,230
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Gump, what are you doing?

1539
01:33:36,298 --> 01:33:37,731
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Take a left!

1540
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:38,789
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Left!

1541
01:33:40,670 --> 01:33:44,606
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That's where we're going
to find those shrimp, my boy!

1542
01:33:45,676 --> 01:33:47,803
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That's where we'll find them.

1543
01:34:00,225 --> 01:34:02,159
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.

1544
01:34:02,228 --> 01:34:04,162
{\fnTahoma\fs13}O.K., so I was wrong.

1545
01:34:04,230 --> 01:34:07,165
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well, how are we
going to find them?

1546
01:34:07,234 --> 01:34:11,261
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.

1547
01:34:11,339 --> 01:34:14,001
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# So pray that #

1548
01:34:14,076 --> 01:34:17,341
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# I'm homeward bound... #

1549
01:34:17,412 --> 01:34:20,108
{\fnTahoma\fs13}So I went to church every Sunday.

1550
01:34:21,551 --> 01:34:23,485
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,

1551
01:34:23,553 --> 01:34:27,421
{\fnTahoma\fs13}though I think he left
the praying up to me.

1552
01:34:41,941 --> 01:34:43,340
{\fnTahoma\fs13}No shrimp.

1553
01:34:44,444 --> 01:34:47,379
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Where the hell's
this God of yours?

1554
01:34:47,447 --> 01:34:49,881
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that

1555
01:34:49,951 --> 01:34:53,768
{\fnTahoma\fs13}'cause right then God showed up.

1556
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:11,854
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You'll never sink this boat!

1557
01:35:11,922 --> 01:35:14,584
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now, me, I was scared,

1558
01:35:14,659 --> 01:35:18,720
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.

1559
01:35:18,797 --> 01:35:19,786
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Come on!

1560
01:35:22,334 --> 01:35:24,632
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You call this a storm?

1561
01:35:24,704 --> 01:35:28,640
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Come on, you son of a bitch!

1562
01:35:28,709 --> 01:35:32,645
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's time for a show down!

1563
01:35:32,714 --> 01:35:34,181
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You and me!

1564
01:35:34,248 --> 01:35:37,308
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm right here!
Come and get me!

1565
01:35:39,988 --> 01:35:41,421
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You'll never sink...

1566
01:35:41,490 --> 01:35:42,787
{\fnTahoma\fs13}this...

1567
01:35:42,858 --> 01:35:43,950
{\fnTahoma\fs13}boat!

1568
01:35:46,029 --> 01:35:48,124
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hurricane Carmen
came through here yesterday,

1569
01:35:48,257 --> 01:35:50,054
{\fnTahoma\fs13}destroying nearly
everything in its path.

1570
01:35:50,127 --> 01:35:53,062
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And as in other towns
up and down the coast,

1571
01:35:53,130 --> 01:35:55,928
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industry

1572
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,332
{\fnTahoma\fs13}has fallen victim to Carmen

1573
01:35:58,403 --> 01:36:01,236
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and has been left in utter ruin.

1574
01:36:01,305 --> 01:36:02,738
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This reporter has learned,

1575
01:36:02,808 --> 01:36:05,242
{\fnTahoma\fs13}in fact, only one shrimping boat

1576
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:06,834
{\fnTahoma\fs13}actually survived the storm.

1577
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:09,380
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

1578
01:36:09,449 --> 01:36:12,543
{\fnTahoma\fs13}After that, shrimping was easy.

1579
01:36:12,619 --> 01:36:15,383
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# There will be great bounty #

1580
01:36:15,456 --> 01:36:18,118
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Oh, my God... #

1581
01:36:18,192 --> 01:36:20,126
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Since people still
needed them shrimps

1582
01:36:20,195 --> 01:36:22,561
{\fnTahoma\fs13}for shrimp cocktails
and barbecues and all

1583
01:36:22,631 --> 01:36:25,566
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and we were the only boat
left standing,

1584
01:36:25,634 --> 01:36:28,068
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Bubba Gump shrimp's
what they got.

1585
01:36:28,137 --> 01:36:31,072
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We got a whole bunch of boats.

1586
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:33,074
{\fnTahoma\fs13}12 Jennys, big old warehouse.

1587
01:36:33,143 --> 01:36:35,077
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We even have hats

1588
01:36:35,145 --> 01:36:37,579
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that say "Bubba Gump" on them.

1589
01:36:37,648 --> 01:36:39,081
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Bubba Gump Shrimp.

1590
01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:40,583
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's a household name.

1591
01:36:40,652 --> 01:36:42,313
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hold on there, boy.

1592
01:36:42,387 --> 01:36:44,821
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Are you telling me
you're the owner

1593
01:36:44,890 --> 01:36:47,120
{\fnTahoma\fs13}of the Bubba Gump
Shrimp Corporation?

1594
01:36:47,193 --> 01:36:50,128
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yes. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.

1595
01:36:50,197 --> 01:36:53,132
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Boy, I heard some whoppers
in my time,

1596
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:56,135
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but that tops them all.

1597
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:01,640
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We were sitting
next to a millionaire.

1598
01:37:04,646 --> 01:37:09,640
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well, I thought it was
a very lovely story,

1599
01:37:09,719 --> 01:37:12,779
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and you tell it so well,

1600
01:37:12,856 --> 01:37:14,949
{\fnTahoma\fs13}with such enthusiasm.

1601
01:37:15,025 --> 01:37:19,121
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

1602
01:37:19,196 --> 01:37:21,426
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yes, I would.

1603
01:37:25,704 --> 01:37:27,331
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That's him right there.

1604
01:37:29,575 --> 01:37:32,635
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Let me tell you
something about Lieutenant Dan.

1605
01:37:32,713 --> 01:37:34,203
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest...

1606
01:37:39,387 --> 01:37:43,517
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I never thanked you
for saving my life.

1607
01:38:08,721 --> 01:38:11,155
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He never actually said so,

1608
01:38:11,224 --> 01:38:15,593
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but I think
he made his peace with God.

1609
01:38:22,370 --> 01:38:25,168
{\fnTahoma\fs13}For the second time in 17 days,

1610
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:27,674
{\fnTahoma\fs13}President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.

1611
01:38:27,743 --> 01:38:30,678
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Base to Jenny 1.
Base to Jenny 1.

1612
01:38:30,746 --> 01:38:32,179
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny 1. Go, Margo.

1613
01:38:32,249 --> 01:38:34,183
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest has a phone call.

1614
01:38:34,251 --> 01:38:38,688
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yeah, well, you'll have
to tell them to call him back.

1615
01:38:38,756 --> 01:38:41,190
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He is indisposed at the moment.

1616
01:38:41,259 --> 01:38:42,726
{\fnTahoma\fs13}His mama's sick.

1617
01:39:01,816 --> 01:39:02,748
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Where's Mama?

1618
01:39:02,818 --> 01:39:04,615
{\fnTahoma\fs13}She's upstairs.

1619
01:39:07,055 --> 01:39:08,784
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hi, Forrest.

1620
01:39:09,859 --> 01:39:11,053
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'll see you tomorrow.

1621
01:39:11,127 --> 01:39:12,424
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Oh, all right.

1622
01:39:18,802 --> 01:39:21,635
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?

1623
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:35,310
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What's the matter, Mama?

1624
01:39:35,389 --> 01:39:38,552
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm dying, Forrest.

1625
01:39:40,695 --> 01:39:43,596
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Come on in,
sit down over here.

1626
01:39:57,315 --> 01:39:59,442
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Why are you dying, Mama?

1627
01:39:59,517 --> 01:40:01,610
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's my time.

1628
01:40:01,686 --> 01:40:04,746
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's just my time.

1629
01:40:04,823 --> 01:40:06,848
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Oh, now...

1630
01:40:07,926 --> 01:40:10,486
{\fnTahoma\fs13}don't you be afraid,
sweet heart.

1631
01:40:10,563 --> 01:40:13,964
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Death is just a part of life.

1632
01:40:14,033 --> 01:40:17,992
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Something we're all
destined to do.

1633
01:40:18,072 --> 01:40:20,404
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I didn't know it,

1634
01:40:20,474 --> 01:40:23,409
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but I was destined
to be your mama.

1635
01:40:23,478 --> 01:40:26,208
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I did the best I could.

1636
01:40:26,281 --> 01:40:28,215
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You did good.

1637
01:40:28,284 --> 01:40:34,554
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well... I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.

1638
01:40:34,624 --> 01:40:39,152
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You have to do the best
with what God gave you.

1639
01:40:42,667 --> 01:40:45,261
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What's my destiny, Mama?

1640
01:40:45,337 --> 01:40:49,774
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

1641
01:40:51,111 --> 01:40:54,046
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Life is a box
of chocolates, Forrest.

1642
01:40:54,114 --> 01:40:57,049
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You never know what
you're going to get.

1643
01:40:57,118 --> 01:41:00,053
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mama always hada way
of explaining things

1644
01:41:00,121 --> 01:41:02,055
{\fnTahoma\fs13}so I could understand them.

1645
01:41:02,123 --> 01:41:03,590
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I will miss you, Forrest.

1646
01:41:05,327 --> 01:41:07,591
{\fnTahoma\fs13}She had got the cancer

1647
01:41:07,662 --> 01:41:09,596
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and died on a Tuesday.

1648
01:41:09,665 --> 01:41:12,259
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I bought her a new hat

1649
01:41:12,335 --> 01:41:14,360
{\fnTahoma\fs13}with little flowers on it.

1650
01:41:17,307 --> 01:41:20,003
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And that's all I have
to say about that.

1651
01:41:27,286 --> 01:41:29,982
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number 7 bus?

1652
01:41:30,055 --> 01:41:32,785
{\fnTahoma\fs13}There'll be another one
along shortly.

1653
01:41:36,296 --> 01:41:40,733
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now, because I had been
a football star and war hero

1654
01:41:40,802 --> 01:41:43,737
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and national celebrity
and a shrimping boat captain

1655
01:41:43,805 --> 01:41:45,238
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and a college graduate,

1656
01:41:45,307 --> 01:41:47,741
{\fnTahoma\fs13}the city fathers
of Greenbow, Alabama,

1657
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:50,301
{\fnTahoma\fs13}decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

1658
01:41:51,815 --> 01:41:55,342
{\fnTahoma\fs13}So I never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,

1659
01:41:55,418 --> 01:41:58,353
{\fnTahoma\fs13}though he did take care
of my Bubba Gump money.

1660
01:41:58,422 --> 01:42:01,357
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.

1661
01:42:01,425 --> 01:42:03,859
{\fnTahoma\fs13}So then I got a call from him

1662
01:42:03,929 --> 01:42:06,489
{\fnTahoma\fs13}saying we don't have to worry
about money no more,

1663
01:42:06,565 --> 01:42:10,968
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and I said,
"That's good. One less thing."

1664
01:42:11,037 --> 01:42:12,834
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# I've got a new hope... #

1665
01:42:12,905 --> 01:42:15,339
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now Mama said
there's only so much fortune

1666
01:42:15,409 --> 01:42:17,036
{\fnTahoma\fs13}a man really needs,

1667
01:42:17,110 --> 01:42:20,511
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and the rest
is just for showing off.

1668
01:42:20,581 --> 01:42:23,482
{\fnTahoma\fs13}So I gave a whole bunch of it

1669
01:42:23,551 --> 01:42:26,816
{\fnTahoma\fs13}to the Four square Gospel Church...

1670
01:42:26,888 --> 01:42:31,951
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital...

1671
01:42:33,430 --> 01:42:35,864
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and even though Bubba was dead

1672
01:42:35,932 --> 01:42:39,368
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,

1673
01:42:39,437 --> 01:42:42,167
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.

1674
01:42:45,544 --> 01:42:47,205
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You know what?

1675
01:42:47,279 --> 01:42:51,215
{\fnTahoma\fs13}She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.

1676
01:42:51,283 --> 01:42:53,877
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That smells wonderful.

1677
01:42:53,953 --> 01:42:56,387
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And 'cause I was a gozillionaire

1678
01:42:56,456 --> 01:42:59,391
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and I liked doing it so much,

1679
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:02,896
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I cut that grass for free.

1680
01:43:04,332 --> 01:43:07,768
{\fnTahoma\fs13}But at night time
when there was nothing to do

1681
01:43:07,836 --> 01:43:10,270
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and the house was all empty,

1682
01:43:10,339 --> 01:43:13,274
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'd always think of Jenny.

1683
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:20,590
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And then... she was there.

1684
01:44:53,365 --> 01:44:54,662
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hello, Forrest.

1685
01:44:54,734 --> 01:44:56,929
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hello, Jenny.

1686
01:45:07,782 --> 01:45:10,910
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny came back
and stayed with me.

1687
01:45:10,986 --> 01:45:15,821
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Maybe it was because
she had no where else to go,

1688
01:45:15,891 --> 01:45:19,258
{\fnTahoma\fs13}or maybe it was because
she was so tired

1689
01:45:19,329 --> 01:45:22,765
{\fnTahoma\fs13}'cause she went to bed
and slept and slept

1690
01:45:22,833 --> 01:45:25,063
{\fnTahoma\fs13}like she hadn't slept in years.

1691
01:45:25,136 --> 01:45:27,502
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It was wonderful
having her home.

1692
01:45:27,571 --> 01:45:30,005
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Every day we'd take a walk,

1693
01:45:30,075 --> 01:45:34,011
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and I'd jabber on
like a monkey in a tree,

1694
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:37,015
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and she'd listen about
Ping-Ponging and shrimping

1695
01:45:37,083 --> 01:45:40,018
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and Mama making
a trip up to heaven.

1696
01:45:40,087 --> 01:45:42,021
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I did all the talking.

1697
01:45:42,089 --> 01:45:44,580
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny most of the time
was real quiet.

1698
01:46:24,238 --> 01:46:26,968
{\fnTahoma\fs13}How could you do this?

1699
01:47:04,284 --> 01:47:08,778
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.

1700
01:47:10,291 --> 01:47:13,226
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I never really knew
why she came back,

1701
01:47:13,295 --> 01:47:14,728
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but I didn't care.

1702
01:47:14,796 --> 01:47:16,730
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It was like olden times.

1703
01:47:16,799 --> 01:47:19,597
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We was like
peas and carrots again.

1704
01:47:21,237 --> 01:47:23,671
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Every day,
I'd pick pretty flowers

1705
01:47:23,741 --> 01:47:27,302
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and put them in her room for her,

1706
01:47:27,378 --> 01:47:30,814
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and she gave me the best gift
anyone could ever get

1707
01:47:30,882 --> 01:47:32,315
{\fnTahoma\fs13}in the wide world.

1708
01:47:32,384 --> 01:47:34,909
{\fnTahoma\fs13}They're made just for running.

1709
01:47:34,987 --> 01:47:36,249
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Carry me home to see my kin #

1710
01:47:38,925 --> 01:47:41,450
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And she even showed me
how to dance.

1711
01:47:43,297 --> 01:47:45,663
{\fnTahoma\fs13}#I miss ol'Bammy once again #

1712
01:47:45,732 --> 01:47:46,960
{\fnTahoma\fs13}#And I think it's a sin #

1713
01:47:48,236 --> 01:47:49,897
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Sweet home Alabama... #

1714
01:47:49,971 --> 01:47:54,999
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well, we was like family,
Jenny and me...

1715
01:47:57,913 --> 01:48:01,110
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and it was the happiest time
in my life.

1716
01:48:25,312 --> 01:48:26,745
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You done watching it?

1717
01:48:27,815 --> 01:48:29,806
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm going to bed.

1718
01:48:40,698 --> 01:48:42,256
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Will you marry me?

1719
01:48:47,307 --> 01:48:50,276
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1720
01:48:52,812 --> 01:48:54,712
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You would, Forrest.

1721
01:48:57,151 --> 01:48:58,914
{\fnTahoma\fs13}But you won't marry me.

1722
01:49:01,323 --> 01:49:03,723
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You don't want to marry me.

1723
01:49:06,829 --> 01:49:09,229
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1724
01:49:14,671 --> 01:49:16,605
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm not a smart man,

1725
01:49:16,673 --> 01:49:21,133
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but I know what love is.

1726
01:49:58,055 --> 01:49:59,317
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny...

1727
01:50:01,393 --> 01:50:03,691
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest, I do love you.

1728
01:50:56,723 --> 01:50:59,317
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Where are you running off to?

1729
01:50:59,394 --> 01:51:00,952
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm not running.

1730
01:52:31,386 --> 01:52:33,354
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That day,

1731
01:52:33,421 --> 01:52:34,854
{\fnTahoma\fs13}for no particular reason,

1732
01:52:34,923 --> 01:52:37,915
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I decided to go for a little run.

1733
01:52:37,992 --> 01:52:41,450
{\fnTahoma\fs13}So I ran to the end of the road,

1734
01:52:41,530 --> 01:52:44,863
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and when I got there, I thought
maybe I'd run to the end of town.

1735
01:52:44,934 --> 01:52:47,562
{\fnTahoma\fs13}President Carter,
suffering from heat exhaustion...

1736
01:52:47,636 --> 01:52:49,627
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And when I got there,

1737
01:52:49,705 --> 01:52:53,641
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I thought maybe I'd just
run across Greenbow County.

1738
01:52:53,710 --> 01:52:56,144
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now, I figured
since I'd run this far,

1739
01:52:56,212 --> 01:53:00,080
{\fnTahoma\fs13}maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.

1740
01:53:00,150 --> 01:53:02,084
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And that's what I did.

1741
01:53:02,153 --> 01:53:04,144
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I ran clear across Alabama.

1742
01:53:04,221 --> 01:53:08,749
{\fnTahoma\fs13}No particular reason.
I just kept on going.

1743
01:53:08,826 --> 01:53:10,760
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I ran clear to the ocean.

1744
01:53:16,001 --> 01:53:17,593
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And when I got there,

1745
01:53:17,669 --> 01:53:20,103
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I figured since
I'd gone this far,

1746
01:53:20,172 --> 01:53:23,335
{\fnTahoma\fs13}might as well turn around,
just keep on going.

1747
01:53:25,378 --> 01:53:28,438
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And when I got to another ocean,

1748
01:53:28,514 --> 01:53:31,449
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I figured since
I'd gone this far...

1749
01:53:33,354 --> 01:53:35,652
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I might as well just turn back

1750
01:53:35,723 --> 01:53:37,315
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and keep right on going.

1751
01:53:37,391 --> 01:53:40,724
{\fnTahoma\fs13}when I got tired, I slept.

1752
01:53:40,795 --> 01:53:42,888
{\fnTahoma\fs13}when I got hungry, I ate.

1753
01:53:42,964 --> 01:53:45,398
{\fnTahoma\fs13}When I had to go...

1754
01:53:45,467 --> 01:53:46,491
{\fnTahoma\fs13}you know...

1755
01:53:47,636 --> 01:53:48,796
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I went.

1756
01:53:48,870 --> 01:53:50,064
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And so...

1757
01:53:50,139 --> 01:53:52,164
{\fnTahoma\fs13}you just ran?

1758
01:53:53,809 --> 01:53:55,367
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yeah.

1759
01:53:55,444 --> 01:53:59,141
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Lookin' out at the road
rushin' under my wheels #

1760
01:54:02,319 --> 01:54:05,186
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Lookin' back
at the years gone by #

1761
01:54:05,255 --> 01:54:07,553
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Like so many summer fields #

1762
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:12,391
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# In '65, I was 17 #

1763
01:54:12,463 --> 01:54:14,897
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# And runnin' up one on one #

1764
01:54:16,334 --> 01:54:18,928
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# I don't know
where I'm runnin' now #

1765
01:54:19,004 --> 01:54:22,098
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# I'm just runnin' on #

1766
01:54:22,174 --> 01:54:23,937
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Runnin' on #

1767
01:54:24,009 --> 01:54:25,943
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Runnin' on empty #

1768
01:54:26,011 --> 01:54:27,410
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Runnin' on #

1769
01:54:27,479 --> 01:54:29,276
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Runnin' dry #

1770
01:54:29,349 --> 01:54:30,281
{\fnTahoma\fs13}# Runnin' on... #

1771
01:54:30,350 --> 01:54:31,942
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'd think a lot...

1772
01:54:32,018 --> 01:54:36,284
{\fnTahoma\fs13}about Mama and Bubba
and Lieutenant Dan.

1773
01:54:36,356 --> 01:54:37,880
{\fnTahoma\fs13}But most of all,

1774
01:54:37,957 --> 01:54:39,948
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I thought about Jenny.

1775
01:54:40,027 --> 01:54:42,791
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I thought about her a lot.

1776
01:54:44,265 --> 01:54:45,857
{\fnTahoma\fs13}For more than two years,

1777
01:54:45,933 --> 01:54:47,662
{\fnTahoma\fs13}a man named Forrest Gump,

1778
01:54:47,735 --> 01:54:50,727
{\fnTahoma\fs13}a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
stopping only to sleep,

1779
01:54:50,806 --> 01:54:53,070
{\fnTahoma\fs13}has been running across America.

1780
01:54:53,141 --> 01:54:55,234
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Charles Cooper
brings you this report.

1781
01:54:55,310 --> 01:54:56,572
{\fnTahoma\fs13}For the fourth time

1782
01:54:56,645 --> 01:54:58,237
{\fnTahoma\fs13}on his journey across America,

1783
01:54:58,314 --> 01:55:00,748
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest Gump, the gardener
from Greenbow, Alabama,

1784
01:55:00,817 --> 01:55:03,581
{\fnTahoma\fs13}is about to cross
the Mississippi River again today.

1785
01:55:03,653 --> 01:55:05,086
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'll be damned. Forrest?

1786
01:55:05,154 --> 01:55:07,088
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Sir, where are you running?

1787
01:55:07,156 --> 01:55:09,590
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Are you doing this
for world peace?

1788
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:12,094
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Are you doing this
for the homeless?

1789
01:55:12,162 --> 01:55:14,096
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Are you running
for women's rights?

1790
01:55:14,164 --> 01:55:15,096
{\fnTahoma\fs13}The environment?

1791
01:55:15,165 --> 01:55:16,427
{\fnTahoma\fs13}they just couldn't believe

1792
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:18,934
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that Somebody would do
all that running

1793
01:55:19,003 --> 01:55:20,436
{\fnTahoma\fs13}for no particular reason.

1794
01:55:20,505 --> 01:55:22,097
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Why are you doing this?

1795
01:55:22,173 --> 01:55:24,437
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I just felt like running.

1796
01:55:24,509 --> 01:55:26,136
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I just felt like runnin'.

1797
01:55:27,213 --> 01:55:28,145
{\fnTahoma\fs13}That's you.

1798
01:55:28,214 --> 01:55:30,808
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I can't believe it's really you.

1799
01:55:30,883 --> 01:55:32,316
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now... for some reason,

1800
01:55:32,384 --> 01:55:34,818
{\fnTahoma\fs13}what I was doing seemed to...

1801
01:55:34,887 --> 01:55:36,411
{\fnTahoma\fs13}make sense to people.

1802
01:55:36,489 --> 01:55:39,424
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It was like an alarm
went off in my head.

1803
01:55:39,493 --> 01:55:42,519
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I said, "Here's a guy
that's got his act together.

1804
01:55:42,596 --> 01:55:44,530
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Here's somebody
who has the answer."

1805
01:55:44,598 --> 01:55:46,532
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'll follow you
anywhere, Mr. Gump.

1806
01:55:46,601 --> 01:55:48,933
{\fnTahoma\fs13}So I got company.

1807
01:55:50,471 --> 01:55:53,031
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And after that,
I got more company.

1808
01:55:53,107 --> 01:55:56,634
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And then, even
more people joined in.

1809
01:55:58,647 --> 01:56:00,328
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Somebody later told me

1810
01:56:00,461 --> 01:56:02,019
{\fnTahoma\fs13}it gave people hope.

1811
01:56:03,598 --> 01:56:04,758
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now...

1812
01:56:04,832 --> 01:56:07,323
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now, I don't know
anything about that,

1813
01:56:07,402 --> 01:56:09,836
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but some of those people asked me

1814
01:56:09,905 --> 01:56:11,839
{\fnTahoma\fs13}if I could help them out.

1815
01:56:11,907 --> 01:56:14,341
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I was wondering
if you might help me.

1816
01:56:14,409 --> 01:56:16,343
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm in the bumper sticker business.

1817
01:56:16,412 --> 01:56:18,004
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I need a good slogan,

1818
01:56:18,081 --> 01:56:20,015
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and since you've
been so inspirational,

1819
01:56:20,083 --> 01:56:22,677
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I thought you might
be able to help me...

1820
01:56:22,752 --> 01:56:24,515
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Whoa, man! You just ran

1821
01:56:24,587 --> 01:56:26,885
{\fnTahoma\fs13}through a big pile of dog shit!

1822
01:56:28,125 --> 01:56:29,717
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It happens.

1823
01:56:29,793 --> 01:56:31,158
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What, shit?

1824
01:56:32,229 --> 01:56:33,526
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Sometimes.

1825
01:56:35,967 --> 01:56:38,435
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And some years later,
I heard that that fella

1826
01:56:38,503 --> 01:56:40,767
{\fnTahoma\fs13}did come up with
a bumper sticker slogan

1827
01:56:40,839 --> 01:56:44,104
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and made a lot of money
off of it.

1828
01:56:44,175 --> 01:56:46,109
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Another time,
I was running along.

1829
01:56:46,178 --> 01:56:49,113
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Somebody who'd lost all his money
in the T-shirt business,

1830
01:56:49,181 --> 01:56:52,617
{\fnTahoma\fs13}he wanted to put my face
on a T-shirt,

1831
01:56:52,685 --> 01:56:54,619
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but he couldn't draw that well,

1832
01:56:54,687 --> 01:56:56,621
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and he didn't have a camera.

1833
01:56:56,690 --> 01:57:00,126
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that color anyway.

1834
01:57:04,431 --> 01:57:06,331
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Have a nice day.

1835
01:57:07,935 --> 01:57:09,869
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Someyears later, I found out

1836
01:57:09,937 --> 01:57:13,373
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that that man did come up
with an idea for a T-shirt.

1837
01:57:13,441 --> 01:57:15,602
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He made a lot of money.

1838
01:57:17,946 --> 01:57:19,880
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Anyway, like I was saying,

1839
01:57:19,948 --> 01:57:22,883
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I had a lot of company.

1840
01:57:22,951 --> 01:57:24,384
{\fnTahoma\fs13}My mama always said,

1841
01:57:24,454 --> 01:57:27,389
{\fnTahoma\fs13}"You got to put the past
behind you

1842
01:57:27,457 --> 01:57:29,891
{\fnTahoma\fs13}before you can move on."

1843
01:57:29,959 --> 01:57:33,895
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And I think that's
what my running was all about.

1844
01:57:35,299 --> 01:57:37,893
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I had run for three years...

1845
01:57:37,968 --> 01:57:39,902
{\fnTahoma\fs13}two months...

1846
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:42,063
{\fnTahoma\fs13}14 days, and 16 hours.

1847
01:57:57,256 --> 01:57:59,747
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Quiet. Quiet.
He's going to say something.

1848
01:58:11,271 --> 01:58:13,296
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm pretty tired.

1849
01:58:15,944 --> 01:58:18,037
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Think I'll go home now.

1850
01:58:35,966 --> 01:58:38,560
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Now what are we supposed to do?

1851
01:58:39,803 --> 01:58:41,395
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And just like that...

1852
01:58:42,740 --> 01:58:44,674
{\fnTahoma\fs13}my runnin' days was over.

1853
01:58:46,077 --> 01:58:48,409
{\fnTahoma\fs13}So I went home to Alabama.

1854
01:58:48,613 --> 01:58:50,843
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Moments ago, at 2:25 P.M.,

1855
01:58:50,915 --> 01:58:53,349
{\fnTahoma\fs13}as President Reagan
was leaving the...

1856
01:58:55,254 --> 01:58:57,188
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Five or six gunshots were fired

1857
01:58:57,256 --> 01:58:59,190
{\fnTahoma\fs13}by an unknown, would-be assassin.

1858
01:58:59,258 --> 01:59:01,692
{\fnTahoma\fs13}The president was
shot in the chest...

1859
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:03,352
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I picked up the mail.

1860
01:59:03,430 --> 01:59:06,024
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And one day, out
of the blue clear sky,

1861
01:59:06,099 --> 01:59:08,294
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I got a letter from Jenny

1862
01:59:08,368 --> 01:59:10,802
{\fnTahoma\fs13}wondering if I could
come down to Savannah

1863
01:59:10,870 --> 01:59:14,306
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and see her, and that's
what I'm doing here.

1864
01:59:15,376 --> 01:59:17,810
{\fnTahoma\fs13}She saw me on TV... running.

1865
01:59:17,878 --> 01:59:22,372
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm supposed to go on
the number 9 bus to Richmond Street

1866
01:59:22,451 --> 01:59:25,386
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and get off and go one block left

1867
01:59:25,454 --> 01:59:27,888
{\fnTahoma\fs13}to 1947 Henry Street...

1868
01:59:27,956 --> 01:59:29,218
{\fnTahoma\fs13}apartment 4.

1869
01:59:29,291 --> 01:59:32,886
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Why, you don't need
to take a bus.

1870
01:59:32,962 --> 01:59:36,898
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Henry Street is just
five or six blocks...

1871
01:59:36,966 --> 01:59:38,900
{\fnTahoma\fs13}down that way.

1872
01:59:38,968 --> 01:59:40,401
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Down that way?

1873
01:59:40,470 --> 01:59:41,903
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Down that way.

1874
01:59:43,807 --> 01:59:46,139
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It was nice talking to you.

1875
01:59:48,479 --> 01:59:50,913
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I hope everything
works out for you!

1876
02:00:00,158 --> 02:00:02,251
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest!

1877
02:00:02,328 --> 02:00:04,091
{\fnTahoma\fs13}How you doin'?

1878
02:00:04,163 --> 02:00:05,596
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Come in! Come in!

1879
02:00:05,664 --> 02:00:07,097
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I got your letter.

1880
02:00:07,166 --> 02:00:09,100
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Oh, I was wondering
about that.

1881
02:00:11,004 --> 02:00:12,437
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This your house?

1882
02:00:12,506 --> 02:00:14,098
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yeah. It's messy right now.

1883
02:00:14,174 --> 02:00:16,108
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I just got off work.

1884
02:00:16,176 --> 02:00:18,269
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's nice.

1885
02:00:18,345 --> 02:00:20,210
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You got air-conditioning.

1886
02:00:26,354 --> 02:00:27,616
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Thank you.

1887
02:00:27,688 --> 02:00:29,121
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I ate some.

1888
02:00:31,527 --> 02:00:36,260
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I, uh, kept... kept a scrap book
of... of your clippings and...

1889
02:00:36,331 --> 02:00:38,231
{\fnTahoma\fs13}everything. There you are.

1890
02:00:40,203 --> 02:00:42,068
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yes, I got you running.

1891
02:00:44,140 --> 02:00:47,234
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I ran a long way.

1892
02:00:47,310 --> 02:00:48,971
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's a long time.

1893
02:00:51,315 --> 02:00:52,304
{\fnTahoma\fs13}There...

1894
02:00:59,324 --> 02:01:01,918
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this.

1895
02:01:05,497 --> 02:01:06,429
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I just...

1896
02:01:06,498 --> 02:01:07,931
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I want to apologize

1897
02:01:07,999 --> 02:01:11,935
{\fnTahoma\fs13}for anything that I ever
did to you 'cause...

1898
02:01:12,004 --> 02:01:13,437
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I was messed up...

1899
02:01:13,506 --> 02:01:15,098
{\fnTahoma\fs13}for a long time, and...

1900
02:01:19,680 --> 02:01:20,612
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, you.

1901
02:01:20,681 --> 02:01:23,115
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This is my old friend
from Alabama.

1902
02:01:23,183 --> 02:01:24,775
{\fnTahoma\fs13}How do you do?

1903
02:01:24,851 --> 02:01:28,309
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Next week
my schedule changes, so I can...

1904
02:01:28,389 --> 02:01:30,823
{\fnTahoma\fs13}No problem. Got to go.
I'm double-parked.

1905
02:01:30,892 --> 02:01:31,859
{\fnTahoma\fs13}O.K. Thanks.

1906
02:01:34,529 --> 02:01:36,963
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This is my
very good friend Mr. Gump.

1907
02:01:37,031 --> 02:01:38,293
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Can you say hi?

1908
02:01:38,367 --> 02:01:39,800
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hello, Mr. Gump.

1909
02:01:39,868 --> 02:01:40,732
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hello.

1910
02:01:40,803 --> 02:01:43,033
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Can I go watch TV now?

1911
02:01:43,105 --> 02:01:44,936
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yes. Just keep it low.

1912
02:01:47,142 --> 02:01:48,905
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You're a mama, Jenny.

1913
02:01:48,979 --> 02:01:50,446
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm a mama.

1914
02:01:53,783 --> 02:01:55,216
{\fnTahoma\fs13}His name's Forrest.

1915
02:01:56,653 --> 02:01:57,585
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Like me!

1916
02:01:58,990 --> 02:02:01,424
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I named him after his daddy.

1917
02:02:02,660 --> 02:02:06,426
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He got a daddy
named Forrest, too?

1918
02:02:06,497 --> 02:02:07,930
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You're his daddy, Forrest.

1919
02:02:24,517 --> 02:02:25,950
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest, look at me.

1920
02:02:26,019 --> 02:02:28,487
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Look at me, Forrest.

1921
02:02:30,524 --> 02:02:32,458
{\fnTahoma\fs13}There's nothing you need to do.

1922
02:02:32,526 --> 02:02:34,460
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You didn't do anything wrong.

1923
02:02:35,529 --> 02:02:36,461
{\fnTahoma\fs13}O. K?

1924
02:02:40,969 --> 02:02:42,698
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Isn't he beautiful?

1925
02:02:43,972 --> 02:02:46,907
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1926
02:02:50,980 --> 02:02:51,912
{\fnTahoma\fs13}But...

1927
02:02:55,484 --> 02:02:57,918
{\fnTahoma\fs13}is... is he s-smart? Like, can he...

1928
02:02:57,988 --> 02:02:59,580
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He's very smart.

1929
02:02:59,656 --> 02:03:02,853
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He's one of
the smartest in his class.

1930
02:03:11,502 --> 02:03:14,096
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yeah, it's O.K.
Go talk to him.

1931
02:03:23,515 --> 02:03:24,948
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What are you watching?

1932
02:03:25,017 --> 02:03:26,450
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Bert and Ernie.

1933
02:03:49,435 --> 02:03:50,629
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest...

1934
02:03:52,605 --> 02:03:53,936
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm sick.

1935
02:03:56,443 --> 02:03:59,879
{\fnTahoma\fs13}What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?

1936
02:03:59,947 --> 02:04:03,383
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I have some kind of virus,
and the doctors,

1937
02:04:03,450 --> 02:04:05,384
{\fnTahoma\fs13}they don't know what it is,

1938
02:04:05,453 --> 02:04:08,547
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and there isn't anything
they can do about it.

1939
02:04:13,295 --> 02:04:15,388
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You could come home with me.

1940
02:04:17,133 --> 02:04:18,725
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny, you and...

1941
02:04:18,801 --> 02:04:19,733
{\fnTahoma\fs13}little Forrest

1942
02:04:19,802 --> 02:04:21,235
{\fnTahoma\fs13}could come stay

1943
02:04:21,304 --> 02:04:23,602
{\fnTahoma\fs13}at my house in Greenbow.

1944
02:04:26,977 --> 02:04:30,071
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'll take care of you
if you're sick.

1945
02:04:32,316 --> 02:04:34,409
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Would you marry me, Forrest?

1946
02:04:40,325 --> 02:04:41,292
{\fnTahoma\fs13}O.K.

1947
02:04:42,460 --> 02:04:44,189
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Please take your seats.

1948
02:04:47,766 --> 02:04:49,028
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Forrest?

1949
02:04:49,101 --> 02:04:50,762
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's time to start.

1950
02:05:11,792 --> 02:05:13,123
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Your tie.

1951
02:05:25,875 --> 02:05:28,139
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Lieutenant Dan.

1952
02:05:42,927 --> 02:05:44,554
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Lieutenant Dan.

1953
02:05:45,764 --> 02:05:47,254
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hello, Forrest.

1954
02:05:47,332 --> 02:05:49,857
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You got new legs.

1955
02:05:49,934 --> 02:05:51,868
{\fnTahoma\fs13}New legs!

1956
02:05:51,937 --> 02:05:55,031
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yeah. I got new legs.

1957
02:05:55,107 --> 02:05:56,369
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Custom-made.

1958
02:05:56,442 --> 02:05:57,534
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Titanium alloy.

1959
02:05:57,610 --> 02:06:00,704
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's what they use
on the space shuttle.

1960
02:06:04,451 --> 02:06:06,078
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Magic legs.

1961
02:06:07,954 --> 02:06:08,886
{\fnTahoma\fs13}This...

1962
02:06:09,956 --> 02:06:11,480
{\fnTahoma\fs13}is my fiancee.

1963
02:06:11,559 --> 02:06:12,491
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Susan.

1964
02:06:14,962 --> 02:06:17,522
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Lieutenant Dan.

1965
02:06:17,598 --> 02:06:19,691
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hi, Forrest.

1966
02:06:19,767 --> 02:06:22,235
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Lieutenant Dan...

1967
02:06:22,304 --> 02:06:23,896
{\fnTahoma\fs13}this is my Jenny.

1968
02:06:23,972 --> 02:06:27,237
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hi. It's nice
to meet you finally.

1969
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:40,080
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Do you, Forrest, take Jenny

1970
02:06:40,156 --> 02:06:41,623
{\fnTahoma\fs13}to be your wife?

1971
02:06:43,427 --> 02:06:45,861
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Do you, Jenny, take Forrest

1972
02:06:45,930 --> 02:06:47,522
{\fnTahoma\fs13}to be your husband?

1973
02:06:49,100 --> 02:06:52,558
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And so I pronounce you
man and wife.

1974
02:07:38,654 --> 02:07:40,053
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, Forrest...

1975
02:07:45,428 --> 02:07:47,919
{\fnTahoma\fs13}were you scared in Vietnam?

1976
02:07:49,267 --> 02:07:51,030
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Yes.

1977
02:07:51,102 --> 02:07:52,694
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Well, I...

1978
02:07:52,770 --> 02:07:54,897
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I don't know.

1979
02:07:54,972 --> 02:07:57,031
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Sometimes it would stop raining

1980
02:07:57,108 --> 02:08:00,509
{\fnTahoma\fs13}long enough for
the stars to come out...

1981
02:08:03,448 --> 02:08:05,382
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and then it was nice.

1982
02:08:08,655 --> 02:08:11,715
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It was like just
before the sun goes to bed

1983
02:08:11,791 --> 02:08:13,190
{\fnTahoma\fs13}down on the bayou.

1984
02:08:13,259 --> 02:08:17,992
{\fnTahoma\fs13}there was always
a million sparkles on the water...

1985
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:21,927
{\fnTahoma\fs13}like that mountain lake.

1986
02:08:22,002 --> 02:08:23,936
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It was so clear, Jenny,

1987
02:08:24,004 --> 02:08:26,939
{\fnTahoma\fs13}it looked like
there were two skies

1988
02:08:27,007 --> 02:08:28,941
{\fnTahoma\fs13}one on top of the other.

1989
02:08:30,645 --> 02:08:34,012
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And then in the desert,
when the sun comes up...

1990
02:08:36,484 --> 02:08:37,917
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I couldn't tell

1991
02:08:37,987 --> 02:08:43,789
{\fnTahoma\fs13}where heaven stopped
and the earth began.

1992
02:08:45,094 --> 02:08:47,255
{\fnTahoma\fs13}It's so beautiful.

1993
02:08:51,335 --> 02:08:54,361
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I wish I could've
been there with you.

1994
02:08:57,609 --> 02:08:59,600
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You were.

1995
02:09:09,855 --> 02:09:11,550
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I love you.

1996
02:09:15,628 --> 02:09:18,756
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You died on a Saturday morning.

1997
02:09:20,634 --> 02:09:24,730
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And I had you placed
here under our tree.

1998
02:09:29,143 --> 02:09:32,579
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And I had that house
of your father's

1999
02:09:32,647 --> 02:09:34,911
{\fnTahoma\fs13}bulldozed to the ground.

2000
02:09:38,153 --> 02:09:39,347
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Mama...

2001
02:09:40,489 --> 02:09:42,423
{\fnTahoma\fs13}always said

2002
02:09:42,491 --> 02:09:46,587
{\fnTahoma\fs13}that dyin' was a part of life.

2003
02:09:49,165 --> 02:09:50,928
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I sure wish it wasn't.

2004
02:09:54,337 --> 02:09:55,861
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Little Forrest is...

2005
02:09:57,174 --> 02:09:59,438
{\fnTahoma\fs13}doing just fine.

2006
02:09:59,510 --> 02:10:00,499
{\fnTahoma\fs13}"But..."

2007
02:10:00,577 --> 02:10:03,011
{\fnTahoma\fs13}About to start school again so on,

2008
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:05,105
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and...

2009
02:10:05,182 --> 02:10:08,447
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and I make his breakfast,
lunch, and dinner

2010
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:09,578
{\fnTahoma\fs13}every day.

2011
02:10:11,356 --> 02:10:12,948
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I make sure he...

2012
02:10:14,359 --> 02:10:15,792
{\fnTahoma\fs13}combs his hair

2013
02:10:15,861 --> 02:10:17,954
{\fnTahoma\fs13}and brushes his teeth every day.

2014
02:10:20,199 --> 02:10:22,759
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Teaching him how
to play Ping-Pong.

2015
02:10:25,038 --> 02:10:26,471
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He's really good.

2016
02:10:26,540 --> 02:10:28,633
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Uh, Forrest, you go.

2017
02:10:33,213 --> 02:10:34,646
{\fnTahoma\fs13}We fish a lot.

2018
02:10:38,052 --> 02:10:40,418
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And every night,
we read a book.

2019
02:10:40,488 --> 02:10:41,921
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He's so smart, Jenny.

2020
02:10:44,993 --> 02:10:47,086
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You'd be so proud of him.

2021
02:10:48,831 --> 02:10:50,093
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I am.

2022
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:54,663
{\fnTahoma\fs13}He, uh, wrote you
a... a letter.

2023
02:10:56,005 --> 02:10:58,940
{\fnTahoma\fs13}And he says I can't read it.
I'm not supposed to,

2024
02:10:59,008 --> 02:11:01,943
{\fnTahoma\fs13}so I'll just leave it
here for you.

2025
02:11:18,196 --> 02:11:20,097
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Jenny...

2026
02:11:25,003 --> 02:11:27,938
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I don't know
if Mama was right

2027
02:11:28,006 --> 02:11:31,100
{\fnTahoma\fs13}or if it... it's
Lieutenant Dan.

2028
02:11:31,175 --> 02:11:33,040
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I don't know...

2029
02:11:34,179 --> 02:11:36,841
{\fnTahoma\fs13}if we each have a...

2030
02:11:38,017 --> 02:11:39,143
{\fnTahoma\fs13}destiny...

2031
02:11:40,619 --> 02:11:44,385
{\fnTahoma\fs13}or if we're all just
floating around accidental-like

2032
02:11:44,457 --> 02:11:45,890
{\fnTahoma\fs13}on a breeze...

2033
02:11:50,130 --> 02:11:52,064
{\fnTahoma\fs13}but I... I think...

2034
02:11:53,968 --> 02:11:55,731
{\fnTahoma\fs13}maybe it's both.

2035
02:11:59,974 --> 02:12:03,205
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Maybe both get happening
at the same time.

2036
02:12:08,984 --> 02:12:10,918
{\fnTahoma\fs13}But I miss you, Jenny.

2037
02:12:17,493 --> 02:12:19,484
{\fnTahoma\fs13}If there's anything
you need...

2038
02:12:20,663 --> 02:12:22,597
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I won't be far away.

2039
02:12:56,970 --> 02:12:59,404
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Here's your bus.

2040
02:12:59,473 --> 02:13:00,838
{\fnTahoma\fs13}O.K.

2041
02:13:00,907 --> 02:13:03,398
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey...

2042
02:13:03,478 --> 02:13:04,911
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I know this.

2043
02:13:04,979 --> 02:13:07,413
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'm gonna share that
for show-and-tell

2044
02:13:07,482 --> 02:13:10,645
{\fnTahoma\fs13}because Grandma used
to read it to you.

2045
02:13:10,718 --> 02:13:12,777
{\fnTahoma\fs13}My favorite book.

2046
02:13:16,258 --> 02:13:17,691
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Here we are.

2047
02:13:17,759 --> 02:13:19,090
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey...

2048
02:13:20,997 --> 02:13:22,430
{\fnTahoma\fs13}here you go.

2049
02:13:27,604 --> 02:13:29,162
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Hey, Forrest...

2050
02:13:29,239 --> 02:13:30,706
{\fnTahoma\fs13}don't...

2051
02:13:33,511 --> 02:13:36,036
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I want to tell you
I love you.

2052
02:13:36,113 --> 02:13:38,081
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I love you, too, Daddy.

2053
02:13:38,149 --> 02:13:41,016
{\fnTahoma\fs13}I'll be right here
when you get back.

2054
02:13:46,458 --> 02:13:49,894
{\fnTahoma\fs13}You understand this is the bus
to school, now, don't you?

2055
02:13:49,962 --> 02:13:53,728
{\fnTahoma\fs13}Of course, and you're Dorothy
Harris, and I'm Forrest Gump.
