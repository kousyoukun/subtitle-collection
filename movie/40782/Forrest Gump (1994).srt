1
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,351
Hello.
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

2
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,871
Do you want a chocolate?

3
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,557
I could eat
about a million and a half of these.

4
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,350
My mama always said
life was like a box of chocolates.

5
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,030
You never know
what you're going to get.

6
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,073
Those must be comfortable shoes.

7
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,950
I bet you could walk all day in shoes
like that and not feel a thing.

8
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,752
- I wish I had shoes like that.
- My feet hurt.

9
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,589
Mama always said there's an awful lot

10
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,831
you can tell about a person
by their shoes.

11
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,196
Where they're going,
where they've been.

12
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,514
I've worn lots of shoes.

13
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,675
I bet if I think about it real hard,

14
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,275
I could remember
my first pair of shoes.

15
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,998
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.

16
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,033
She said they was my magic shoes.

17
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,510
All right, Forrest,
open your eyes now.

18
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,196
Let's take a little walk around.

19
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,831
How do those feel?

20
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,117
His legs are strong, Mrs Gump,
as strong as I've ever seen.

21
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,113
But his back's as
crooked as a politician.

22
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,636
But we're going to straighten him
right up, aren't we, Forrest?

23
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,159
When I was a baby, Mama named me
after the great Civil War hero

24
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,879
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

25
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,269
She said we was related to him
in some way.

26
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,354
What he did was he started up
this club called the Ku Klux Klan.

27
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,637
They'd all dress up
in their robes and their bed sheets

28
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,077
and act like a bunch
of ghosts or spooks or something.

29
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,869
They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.

30
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,953
And anyway, that's how
I got my name, Forrest Gump.

31
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,749
Mama said the Forrest part
was to remind me that sometimes

32
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,197
we all do things that, well,
just don't make no sense.

33
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,679
This way. Hold on.

34
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,476
All right.
What are y'all staring at?

35
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,838
Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?

36
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,794
Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest.

37
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,235
If God wanted everybody
to be the same,

38
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,959
he'd have given us all
braces on our legs.

39
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,316
Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.

40
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,435
We lived about
a quarter mile off Route 17,

41
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,318
about a half mile
from the town of Greenbow, Alabama.

42
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,198
That's in the county of Greenbow.

43
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,558
Our house had been in Mama's family
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa

44
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,712
had come across the ocean
about a thousand years ago.

45
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,237
Since it was just me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,

46
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,472
Mama decided to let those rooms out,
mostly to people passing through,

47
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,757
like from Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.

48
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,960
That's how me and Mama got money.
Mama was a real smart lady.

49
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,191
Remember what I told you, Forrest.

50
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,477
You're no different
than anybody else is.

51
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,995
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?
You're the same as everybody else.

52
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,389
You are no different.

53
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:15,749
Your boy's different, Mrs Gump.
His I.Q. Is 75.

54
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,594
Well, we're all different,
Mr Hancock.

55
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,558
She wanted me to have
the finest education,

56
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,076
so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.

57
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,230
I met the principal and all.

58
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,517
I want to show you
something, Mrs Gump.

59
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:41,039
Now, this is normal.
Forrest is right here.

60
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,277
The state requires a minimum I.Q.
Of 80 to attend public school.

61
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,433
Mrs Gump, he's going to have
to go to a special school.

62
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,116
- He'll be just fine.
- What does normal mean anyway?

63
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,228
He might be a bit on the slow side,
but my boy Forrest

64
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,392
will get the same opportunities
as everyone else.

65
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,598
He's not going to some special school
to learn how to retread tyres.

66
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,036
We're talking about
five little points here.

67
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,078
There must be something can be done.

68
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,193
We're a progressive school system.

69
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,592
We don't want to see
anybody left behind.

70
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,196
Is there a Mr Gump, Mrs Gump?

71
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,796
He's on vacation.

72
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,992
Your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

73
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,428
You don't say much, do you?

74
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,316
"Finally, he had to try.
It looked easy, but...

75
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,789
"Oh, what happened. First they..."

76
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,237
- Mama, what's vacation mean?
- Vacation?

77
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,993
Where daddy went?

78
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,431
Vacation's when you go somewhere...
and you don't ever come back.

79
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,351
Anyway, I guess you could say
me and Mama was on our own.

80
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,632
But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.

81
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,518
There was always
folks coming and going.

82
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,071
- Supper! It's supper, everyone!
- That sure looks special.

83
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,549
Sometimes, we had so many people
staying with us

84
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,837
that every room was filled,
with travellers, you know,

85
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,597
folks living out of their suitcases
and hat cases and sample cases.

86
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,593
Forrest Gump,
it's suppertime! Forrest?

87
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,913
One time, a young man was staying
with us, and he had a guitar case.

88
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,268
Forrest, I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

89
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,839
No, that's all right, ma'am.

90
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,196
I was showing him
a thing or two on the guitar.

91
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,078
All right. Supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

92
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,958
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

93
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,273
Say, show me that crazy little walk
you did there. Slow it down some.

94
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,239
I liked that guitar. It sounded good.

95
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:00,913
I started moving around to the music,
swinging my hips.

96
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,549
This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,

97
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,791
and we walked by Benson's furniture
and appliance store, and guess what?

98
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,313
This is not for children's eyes.

99
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,678
Some years later, that handsome
young man who they called The King,

100
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,513
well, he sung too many songs.

101
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,478
Had himself a heart attack
or something.

102
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,393
It must be hard being a king.

103
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,360
It's funny how you remember some
things, but some things you can't.

104
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,750
- You do your very best now, Forrest.
- I sure will, Mama.

105
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,595
I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school very well.

106
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,351
Are you coming along?

107
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,750
Mama said not to take rides
from strangers.

108
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,751
This is the bus to school.

109
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,589
- I'm Forrest, Forrest Gump.
- I'm Dorothy Harris.

110
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,830
Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.

111
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,789
This seat's taken.

112
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,151
It's taken.

113
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,111
You can't sit here.

114
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,677
You know, it's funny what
a young man recollects,

115
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,433
'cause I don't remember being born.

116
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,478
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

117
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,109
and I don't know when I went
on my first outdoor picnic,

118
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,988
but I do remember
the first time I heard

119
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,436
the sweetest voice in the wide world.

120
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,353
You can sit here if you want.

121
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,638
I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.

122
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,796
She was like an angel.

123
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,111
Well, are you going
to sit down or aren't you?

124
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,351
What's wrong with your legs?

125
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,070
Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.

126
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,958
I just sat next to her on that bus

127
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,793
and had a conversation
all the way to school.

128
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,110
My back's crooked
like a question mark.

129
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,069
Next to Mama, no one ever talked
to me or asked me questions.

130
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,390
Are you stupid or something?

131
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,870
Mama says,
"Stupid is as stupid does."

132
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,829
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Forrest, Forrest Gump.

133
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,559
From that day on,
we was always together.

134
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,234
Jenny and me
was like peas and carrots.

135
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,030
She taught me how to climb.

136
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,429
Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

137
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,988
I showed her how to dangle.

138
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,874
She helped me learn how to read,
and I showed her how to swing.

139
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,751
Sometimes, we'd just sit out
and wait for the stars.

140
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,960
- Mama's going to worry about me.
- Just stay a little longer.

141
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,953
For some reason,
Jenny never wanted to go home.

142
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,634
OK, Jenny, I'll stay.

143
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,030
She was my most special friend.

144
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,640
My only friend.

145
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,029
My Mama always told me
that miracles happen every day.

146
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,669
Some people don't think so,
but they do.

147
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,678
Hey, dummy!

148
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,155
Are you retarded,
or just plain stupid?

149
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,391
- Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.
- Just run away, Forrest.

150
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,553
Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!

151
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,997
- Get the bikes!
- Let's get him! Come on!

152
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,631
Look out, dummy!
We're going to get you!

153
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,793
Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!

154
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,435
Come back here, you!

155
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,995
Run, Forrest! Run!

156
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,915
You wouldn't
believe it if I told you,

157
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,231
but I can run like the wind blows.

158
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,117
From that day on, if I was
going somewhere, I was running.

159
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,677
That boy sure is a running fool.

160
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,194
Remember how I told you that Jenny
never seemed to want to go home?

161
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,670
She lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.

162
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,194
Her mama had gone to heaven
when she was five,

163
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,637
and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.

164
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,517
Jenny?

165
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,556
He was a very loving man.

166
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,758
He was always kissing
and touching her and her sisters.

167
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,155
And then this one time, Jenny
wasn't on the bus to go to school.

168
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,629
Jenny,
why didn't you come to school today?

169
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,391
Daddy's taking a nap.

170
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,392
Come on!

171
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,478
Jenny, where'd you run to?
You better get back here, girl!

172
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,269
Where you at?

173
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,270
Jenny! Jenny, where you at?

174
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,031
Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.

175
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,508
Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly
far, far, far away from here.

176
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,310
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far...

177
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,153
Mama always said God is mysterious.

178
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,234
He didn't turn Jenny
into a bird that day.

179
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,915
Instead, he had the police say

180
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,390
Jenny didn't have to stay
in that house no more.

181
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,598
She was to live with her grandma,
just over on Creekmore Avenue,

182
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,514
which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.

183
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,159
Some nights, Jenny'd sneak out
and come on over to my house,

184
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,678
just 'cause she said she was scared.
Scared of what, I don't know.

185
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:56,073
But I think it was her grandma's dog.
He was a mean dog.

186
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,552
Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends
all the way up through high school.

187
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,075
- Hey, stupid!
- Quit it!

188
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,513
Run, Forrest, run!

189
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,037
- Didn't you hear me, stupid?
- Run, Forrest!

190
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,511
Get in the truck!
Come on! He's getting away! Move it!

191
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,909
Run, Forrest! Run!

192
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,875
Run, Forrest!

193
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,192
Now, it used to be
I ran to get where I was going.

194
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,590
I never thought
it would take me anywhere.

195
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,991
Who in the hell is that?

196
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,710
That is Forrest Gump, coach.
Just a local idiot.

197
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,868
And can you believe it?
I got to go to college, too.

198
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,676
- Forrest, move it! Run!
- OK!

199
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,514
- Run!
- Run, you stupid son of a bitch!

200
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,593
Run, son of a bitch, run! Go! Run!

201
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,268
He must be the stupidest son of
a bitch alive, but he sure is fast.

202
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,069
Now, maybe it's just me,
but college was very confusing times.

203
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,635
Federal troops,
enforcing a court order,

204
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,870
integrated
the University of Alabama today.

205
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,393
Two Negroes were admitted,

206
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,313
but only after Governor George
Wallace had carried out

207
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,551
his symbolic threat
to stand in the schoolhouse door.

208
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,157
Earl, what's going on?

209
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,629
Coons are trying to get into school.

210
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,518
Coons? When racoons
tried getting on our back porch,

211
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,830
Mama just chased them off
with a broom.

212
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,596
Not racoons, you idiot. Niggers.
They want to go to school with us.

213
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,557
With us? They do?

214
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,471
Shortly after Governor Wallace

215
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,313
had carried out his promise
to block the doorway,

216
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,516
President Kennedy
ordered the Secretary of Defence

217
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,477
to use military force.

218
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,120
Here, by videotape,
is the encounter by General Graham,

219
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,714
commander of the national guard,
and Governor Wallace.

220
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,839
Because these national guardsmen
are here today

221
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,549
as federal soldiers for Alabama,
and they live within our borders.

222
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,952
They are our brothers.
We are winning in this fight,

223
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,318
because we are awakening
the American people to the dangers

224
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,916
that we have spoken about
so many times, so evident today,

225
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,515
a trend toward military
dictatorship in this country.

226
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,952
And so, at day's end,

227
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,715
the University of Alabama
in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated,

228
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,872
and students Jimmy Hood
and Vivian Malone

229
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,032
had been signed up
for summer classes.

230
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,996
Ma'am, you dropped your book. Ma'am.

231
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,518
Governor Wallace
did what he promised.

232
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,910
By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob from gathering...

233
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,436
- Say, wasn't that Gump?
- Naw, that couldn't be.

234
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,318
It sure as hell was.

235
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,792
A few years later, that angry
little man at the schoolhouse door

236
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,838
thought it'd be a good idea
and ran for President.

237
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,112
But somebody thought that it wasn't.
But he didn't die.

238
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,914
- My bus is here.
- Is it the number nine?

239
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,152
- No, it's the number four.
- It was nice talking to you.

240
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:56,435
I remember when that happened, when
Wallace got shot. I was in college.

241
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,478
Did you go to a girls college
or a girls and boys together college?

242
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,437
It was coed.

243
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,638
Jenny went to a college I couldn't go
to. It was a college just for girls.

244
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,030
But I'd go and visit her
every chance I got.

245
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,517
That hurts.

246
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,590
Forrest, stop it! Stop it!
What are you doing?

247
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,470
- He was hurting you.
- No, he wasn't! Get over there!

248
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,358
- Billy, I'm sorry.
- Just keep away from me.

249
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,194
Don't be such a... Don't go.
Billy, wait a second.

250
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,635
He doesn't know any better.

251
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,038
Forrest, why'd you do that?

252
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,990
I brought you some chocolate.
I'm sorry.

253
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,710
I'll go back to my college now.

254
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,271
Look at you.

255
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,154
Come on. Come on.

256
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,349
Is this your own room?

257
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,755
Do you ever dream, Forrest,
about who you're going to be?

258
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,798
Who I'm going to be?
Aren't I going to be me?

259
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,077
You'll always be you,
just another kind of you.

260
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,914
You know? I want to be famous.

261
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,715
I want to be a singer
like Joan Baez.

262
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:20,716
I just want to be on an empty stage
with my guitar, my voice.

263
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,075
Just me.

264
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,148
And I want to reach people
on a personal level.

265
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,074
I want to be able to say things,
just one to one.

266
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,229
Have you ever been with a girl,
Forrest?

267
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,959
I sit next to them in my home
economics class all the time.

268
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,592
I'm sorry.

269
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,955
- It's OK.
- Sorry.

270
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,677
It's all right.

271
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,676
- It's OK.
- I'm dizzy.

272
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,150
I'll bet that never
happened in home ec.

273
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,519
No.

274
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,230
I think I ruined
your roommate's bathrobe.

275
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,595
I don't care.
I don't like her anyway.

276
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,553
College ran by real fast
'cause I played so much football.

277
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,189
They even put me on a thing
called the All-America team

278
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,829
where you get to meet the President
of the United States.

279
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,071
President Kennedy met with the
collegiate All-American football team

280
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,718
at the Oval Office today.

281
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:37,191
The really good thing about meeting
the President of the United States

282
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,955
is the food.
They put you in this little room

283
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,396
with just about anything
you'd want to eat or drink.

284
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,677
But since, number one,
I wasn't hungry, but thirsty,

285
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,198
and number two, they was free, I must
have drank about 15 Dr Peppers.

286
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,954
How does it feel
to be an All-American?

287
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,439
It's an honour, sir.

288
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,750
How does it feel
to be an All-American?

289
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,717
Very good, sir.

290
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,234
How does it feel
to be an All-American?

291
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,594
Very good, sir.

292
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,992
- Congratulations. How do you feel?
- I got to pee.

293
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,435
I believe he said he had to pee.

294
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,318
Some time later,
for no particular reason,

295
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,679
somebody shot that nice young
President when he was in his car.

296
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,072
And a few years after that, somebody
shot his little brother, too,

297
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,276
only he was in a hotel kitchen.

298
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,189
Must be hard being brothers.
I wouldn't know.

299
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,596
Now can you believe it?

300
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,639
After only five years of playing
football, I got a college degree.

301
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,711
Congratulations, son.

302
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,791
Mama was so proud.

303
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,834
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.
I'll hold this for you.

304
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,956
Congratulations, son.

305
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,271
Have you given
any thought to your future?

306
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,792
Thought?

307
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,836
Hello. I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

308
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,037
Nobody gives a horse's shit
who you are, pus ball!

309
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,793
You're not even a lowlife,
scum-sucking maggot!

310
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,395
Get your maggoty ass on the bus!
You're in the army now!

311
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,031
- Seat's taken.
- Taken.

312
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,158
At first it seemed
like I made a mistake.

313
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,074
It was only my induction day,
and I was getting yelled at.

314
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,710
Sit down if you want to.

315
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,709
I didn't know who I might meet
or what they might ask.

316
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,394
You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

317
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,792
No. But I been on a real big boat.

318
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,713
I'm talking about
a shrimp catching boat.

319
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,553
I been working on shrimp boats
all my life.

320
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,792
I started out on my uncle's boat
when I was about maybe nine.

321
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,635
I was just looking into buying
my own boat and got drafted.

322
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,871
My given name
is Benjamin Buford Blue.

323
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,953
People call me Bubba, just like
one of them old redneck boys.

324
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,837
Can you believe that?

325
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:27,072
My name's Forrest Gump.
People call me Forrest Gump.

326
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:31,756
So Bubba was from Bayou La Batre,
Alabama, and his mama cooked shrimp.

327
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,835
And her mama before her
cooked shrimp,

328
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,356
and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.

329
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,193
Bubba's family knew
everything there was to know

330
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,032
about the shrimping business.

331
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,271
I know everything there is to know
about the shrimping business.

332
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,672
I'm going into the shrimping business
myself after I get out of the army.

333
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,195
Gump! What's your sole purpose
in this army?

334
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,669
To do whatever you tell me,
drill sergeant!

335
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,116
God damn it, Gump,
you're a goddamn genius.

336
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,589
That's the most outstanding answer
I've ever heard.

337
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,674
You must have a goddamn I.Q. Of 160.
You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump.

338
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,075
Listen up, people!

339
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,199
For some reason, I fit in the army
like one of them round pegs.

340
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,191
It's not really hard.

341
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,477
You just make your bed neat,
remember to stand up straight,

342
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,916
and always answer every question
with "Yes, drill sergeant."

343
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,709
- Is that clear?
- Yes, drill sergeant!

344
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,110
What you do is
drag your nets along the bottom.

345
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,318
On a good day, you can catch
over a hundred pounds of shrimp.

346
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,392
Everything goes all right,
two men shrimping ten hours,

347
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,311
less what you spends on gas...

348
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,995
- Done, drill sergeant!
- Gump!

349
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,199
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly?

350
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,077
You told me to, drill sergeant.

351
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,709
Jesus H. Christ.
This is a new company record.

352
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,598
If it wasn't a waste
of a fine enlisted man,

353
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,910
I'd recommend you for O.C.S.,
Private Gump.

354
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,195
You're going to be a general someday!

355
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,840
Now disassemble your weapon
and continue!

356
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:14,079
Anyway, like I was saying,
shrimp is the fruit of the sea.

357
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,870
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it.

358
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,838
There's shrimp kabobs, shrimp creole,

359
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,914
shrimp gumbo, pan fried,
deep fried, stir fried.

360
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,516
There's pineapple shrimp
and lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp,

361
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,195
pepper shrimp,
shrimp soup, shrimp stew,

362
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:41,799
shrimp salad, shrimp in potatoes,
shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich.

363
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,797
That's about it.

364
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,917
Night-time in the army
is a lonely time.

365
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,710
We'd lay there in our bunks,
and I'd miss my mama,

366
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,234
and I'd miss Jenny.

367
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,317
Gump, get a load of the tits on her.

368
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,636
Turns out Jenny had gotten
into some trouble

369
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,871
over some photos of her
in her college sweater.

370
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,951
And she was thrown out of school.

371
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,634
But that wasn't a bad thing,

372
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,474
'cause a man who owns a theatre
in Memphis, Tennessee,

373
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,680
saw those photos and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.

374
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,038
The first chance I got,
I took the bus up to Memphis

375
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,156
to see her perform in that show.

376
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,118
That was Amber, Amber Flame.
Give her a big hand.

377
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,919
And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,

378
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,549
direct from Hollywood, California,
our very own beatnik beauty.

379
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,428
Let's give a big round of applause
to the luscious Bobbie Dylon.

380
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,474
Her dream had come true.
She was a folk singer.

381
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,917
- Come on baby, shake it up now!
- Somebody get her a harmonica.

382
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,071
- This ain't Captain Kangaroo!
- I got something here for you.

383
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,752
God damn it!

384
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,391
Hey, you stupid jerk!
I'm singing a song here.

385
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,910
Paulie, get out here!

386
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,873
Shut up!

387
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:17,111
Forrest! What are you doing here?
What are you doing?

388
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,797
What are you doing, Forrest?
Let me down!

389
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,073
You can't keep doing this, Forrest.
You can't keep trying to rescue me.

390
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,233
- They was trying to grab you.
- A lot of people try to grab me.

391
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,154
You can't keep
doing this all the time.

392
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,516
I can't help it. I love you.

393
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,796
You don't know what love is.

394
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,795
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

395
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,554
We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far away?

396
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,836
Yes, I do.

397
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,478
You think
I could fly off this bridge?

398
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,358
What do you mean, Jenny?

399
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,236
Nothing.

400
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,795
I gotta get out of here.

401
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,390
- Wait, Jenny.
- Forrest, you stay away from me, OK?

402
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,311
Just stay away from me, please.

403
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,994
- Can I have a ride?
- Where are you going?

404
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,469
- I don't care.
- Get in the truck.

405
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,551
So bye-bye, Jenny.

406
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,354
They sending me to Vietnam.

407
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,510
It's this whole other country.

408
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,830
Just hang on a minute.

409
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,633
Listen, you promise me something, OK?

410
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,678
Just if you're ever in trouble,
don't be brave.

411
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,639
- You just run, OK? Just run away.
- OK.

412
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,433
I'll write you all the time.

413
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,270
And just like that, she was gone.

414
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,708
You come back safe to me.
Do you hear?

415
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,118
They told us that Vietnam
was going to be very different

416
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,270
from the United States of America.

417
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:42,071
Except for all the beer cans
and barbecues, it was.

418
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,312
I'll bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

419
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,198
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimp.

420
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,795
After we win this war
and we take over everything,

421
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,316
we can get American shrimpers out
here and shrimp these waters.

422
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,277
Just shrimp all the time, man.

423
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,190
- You must be my FNGs.
- Morning, sir.

424
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,033
Get your hands down.
Do not salute me.

425
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,554
There are goddamn snipers
all around this area

426
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,631
who'd love to grease an officer.

427
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,757
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fort Platoon.

428
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,670
- What's wrong with your lip?
- I was born with big gums, sir.

429
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,151
Well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

430
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,156
Where are you boys from in the world?

431
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,915
- Alabama, sir!
- You twins?

432
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,554
No. We are not relations, sir.

433
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,351
Look, it's pretty basic here.
You stick with me and learn

434
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,989
from the guys who've been in country
a while, you'll be all right.

435
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,116
There is one item of G.I. Gear

436
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,193
that can be the difference
between life and death. Socks.

437
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,109
Cushioned sole, O.D. Green.
Try and keep your feet dry.

438
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,829
When we're out humpin',
change your socks whenever we stop.

439
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,230
The Mekong will eat
a grunt's feet right off his legs.

440
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,279
Sergeant Sims. God damn it, where's
that sling rope I said to order?

441
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,069
- I put in the requisitions.
- Well, call those sons of bitches...

442
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:25,915
Lieutenant Dan knew his stuff. I felt
real lucky he was my lieutenant.

443
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,595
He was from a long,
great military tradition.

444
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,559
Somebody in his family
had fought and died

445
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,428
in every single American war.

446
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,517
God damn it, kick some ass.
Get on it!

447
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,309
I guess you could say
he had a lot to live up to.

448
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,110
So, you boys from Arkansas?
Well, I been through there.

449
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,760
Little Rock's a fine town.

450
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,877
Now, shake down your gear.
See the platoon sergeant.

451
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,520
Draw what you need for the field.

452
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,752
If you boys are hungry, we got
steaks burning right over here.

453
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:09,153
Two standing orders in this platoon.
One, take good care of your feet.

454
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:14,633
Two, try not to do anything stupid,
like getting yourself killed.

455
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,436
I sure hope I don't let him down.

456
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:38,513
I got to see a lot of countryside.
We would take these real long walks.

457
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,797
And we were always lookin'
for this guy named Charlie.

458
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,354
- Hold it up!
- Hold up, boys!

459
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,673
It wasn't always fun.

460
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,957
Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings

461
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:13,876
about a rock or a trail or the road,
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up.

462
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,190
Get down! Shut up!

463
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,071
So we did.

464
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,395
I don't know much about anything,

465
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,995
but I think some of America's
best young men served in this war.

466
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,116
There was Dallas from Phoenix.

467
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,677
Cleveland, he was from Detroit.

468
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,151
Hey, Tex. What the hell's going on?

469
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,109
And Tex was... Well, I don't
remember where Tex come from.

470
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,156
Ah, nothing.

471
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,111
Fourth platoon, on your feet.

472
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,478
Y'all got 10 clicks
to go to that river. Move out.

473
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:14,916
- One, two, hup!
- Step it up! Look alive out there.

474
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,515
The good thing about Vietnam
is there was always someplace to go.

475
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,511
Fire in the hole!

476
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,789
Gump, check out that hole.

477
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,678
And there was always something to do.

478
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,638
Mount 'em up!
Spread out! Cover his back!

479
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:42,310
One day it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months.

480
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,472
We've been through every
kind of rain there is.

481
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:52,033
Little bitty stinging rain
and big old fat rain,

482
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:56,398
rain that flew in sideways,
and sometimes rain even seemed

483
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,836
to come straight up from underneath.

484
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,196
Shoot, it even rained at night.

485
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,078
- Hey, Forrest.
- Hey, Bubba.

486
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,755
I'm going to lean up against you.
You lean up against me.

487
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,913
This way we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud.

488
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,434
You know why
we're a good partnership, Forrest?

489
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:21,469
'Cause we be watching out for one
another, like brothers and stuff.

490
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,789
Hey, Forrest,
something I been thinking about.

491
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,713
I got a very important question
to ask you.

492
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,075
How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?

493
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,672
- OK.
- Man, I tell you what.

494
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,955
I got it all figured out, too.

495
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,838
So many pounds of shrimp
will pay off the boat.

496
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,071
So many pounds for gas.
We'll live right on the boat.

497
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,390
We ain't got to pay no rent.

498
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,189
We can just work it together, split
everything right down the middle.

499
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:59,274
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50. Hey,
Forrest, all the shrimp you can eat.

500
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,229
That's a fine idea.

501
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,959
Bubba did have a fine idea.

502
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,557
I even wrote Jenny
and told her all about it.

503
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,189
I sent her letters.
Not every day, but almost.

504
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,796
I told her what I was doing
and asked her what she was doing,

505
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,838
and told her
how I thought about her always.

506
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,988
And how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from her

507
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,833
just as soon as she had the time.

508
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,673
I'd always let her know
that I was OK.

509
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:41,791
Then I'd sign each letter
"Love, Forrest Gump."

510
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,636
This one day,
we was out walking like always,

511
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:04,397
and then, just like that,
somebody turned off the rain,

512
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,914
and the sun come out.

513
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,036
Ambush! Take cover!

514
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,510
- Get that pig up here, God damn it!
- Forrest, are you OK?

515
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,350
Strong Arm, Strong Arm!

516
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,076
- We've got a man down.
- Strong Arm, this is Leg Lima 6!

517
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,836
Roger, Strong Arm! We have incoming
from the treeline at Point Blue...

518
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,356
...plus two! A.K. S and rockets!
We're getting it hard!

519
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,592
- Misfire! Misfire!
- God damn it!

520
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,988
Get that pig unfucked
and put it in the treeline!

521
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,069
They got us down, hard and hurt.

522
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,630
We're going to move back
to the blue line.

523
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,437
Pull back! Pull back!

524
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,315
- Forrest! Run, Forrest!
- Pull back!

525
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,712
- Run! Run, man! Run!
- Pull back, Gump!

526
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,193
Run, God damn it! Run!

527
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:47,073
I ran and ran
just like Jenny told me to.

528
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:55,672
I ran so far so fast that soon I was
all by myself, which was a bad thing.

529
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,751
Bubba was my best good friend.
I had to make sure he was OK.

530
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,829
Where the hell are you?

531
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:22,472
And on my way back to find Bubba,
there was a boy laying on the ground.

532
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:26,439
Tex. OK.

533
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,669
I couldn't let him lay there
all alone, scared the way he was,

534
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,116
so I grabbed him up
and run him out of there.

535
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,553
Every time I went back
looking for Bubba,

536
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:55,792
somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest, help me!"

537
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,150
OK. Here. Here.

538
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,233
No sweat, man.
Lay back. You'll be OK.

539
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:15,751
I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.

540
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:21,472
I know my position is danger close!
We got Charlie all over this area.

541
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,358
I got to have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

542
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,670
Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

543
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,072
I know he's dead! My whole
goddamn platoon is wiped out!

544
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,870
God damn it! What are you doing?
You leave me here!

545
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,350
Get away.
Just leave me here! Get out!

546
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,955
God, I said leave me here,
God damn it!

547
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,429
Leg Lima six, this is strong-arm.

548
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,432
Be advised your fast
movers are inbound. Over.

549
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,558
Then it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.

550
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,200
Something bit me!

551
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,951
Goddamn son of a bitch!

552
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:09,991
I can't leave the platoon.
I told you to leave me there, Gump.

553
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:14,198
Forget about me. Get yourself out!
Did you hear what I said?

554
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:18,592
Gump, damn it, put me down.
Get your ass out of here.

555
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,197
I didn't ask you to pull me out
of there, God damn you!

556
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,477
- Where do you think you're going?
- To get Bubba.

557
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,516
I got an air strike
inbound right now.

558
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,957
They're going to nape the whole area.
Stay here! That's an order.

559
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,429
I gotta find Bubba!

560
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,393
I'm OK, Forrest. I'm OK.

561
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,234
- Bubba, no.
- I'll be all right.

562
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,073
Come on. Come on. Come on.

563
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,392
I'm OK, Forrest.

564
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,077
I'm OK. I'm fine.

565
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,112
Top smoke. Get it up there.

566
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:20,393
If I'd have known this was going
to be the last time me and Bubba

567
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,756
was gonna talk, I'd of thought
of something better to say.

568
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,719
- Hey, Bubba.
- Hey, Forrest.

569
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:35,796
- Forrest, why did this happen?
- You got shot.

570
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:41,072
Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.

571
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,799
I want to go home.

572
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,996
Bubba was my best good friend.

573
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:52,596
And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner.

574
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,797
Bubba was going to be
a shrimping boat captain,

575
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:00,112
but instead, he died right
there by that river in Vietnam.

576
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,036
That's all I have to say about that.

577
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,953
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

578
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,878
- A bullet?
- That jumped up and bit you.

579
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:23,235
Yes, sir.
Bit me directly in the but-tocks.

580
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:27,472
They said it was a million
dollar wound, but...

581
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,516
The army must keep that money,

582
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:33,229
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

583
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:37,029
The only good thing
about being wounded in the but-tocks

584
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,997
is the ice cream.

585
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:43,232
They gave me all the ice cream
I could eat. And guess what?

586
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,233
A good friend of mine was
in the bed right next door.

587
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:52,436
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

588
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,478
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream!

589
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,799
It's time for your bath,
Lieutenant.

590
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,314
Harper!

591
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,876
Cooper. Larson.

592
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,828
Webster. Gump.

593
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,480
- Gump!
- I'm Forrest Gump.

594
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:39,073
Kyle. Nichols.

595
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:44,479
McMill. Johnson.

596
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,992
Gump, how can you watch
that stupid shit? Turn it off.

597
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,753
You are tuned to the American Forces
Vietnam Network.

598
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,115
This is Channel 6, Saigon.

599
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:17,231
Good catch, Gump.
You know how to play this?

600
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,034
Come on. Let me show you.

601
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,752
The secret to this game is
no matter what happens,

602
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:33,073
never, ever take your eye
off the ball.

603
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,352
All right.

604
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,994
For some reason, ping-pong
came very natural to me.

605
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,277
See? Any idiot can play.

606
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,635
So I started playing it all the time.

607
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:54,548
I played ping-pong even when I didn't
have anyone to play ping-pong with.

608
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:07,789
The hospital's people said it
made me look like a duck in water,

609
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,518
whatever that means.

610
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,797
Even Lieutenant Dan
would come and watch me play.

611
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:22,553
I played ping-pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep.

612
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,831
Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.

613
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,117
Nothing just happens.
It's all part of a plan!

614
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,078
I should have died
out there with my men,

615
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:45,109
but now, I'm nothing but
a goddamn cripple, a legless freak!

616
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:49,117
Look. Look! Look at me!
You see that?

617
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,954
Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?

618
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,676
Yes, sir, I do.

619
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:06,114
Did you hear what I said?
You cheated me! I had a destiny.

620
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,875
I was supposed to die in the field
with honour!

621
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:14,911
That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!

622
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,315
You understand what I'm saying, Gump?

623
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:35,238
This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me. I had a destiny.

624
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:41,711
I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.

625
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,595
You're still Lieutenant Dan.

626
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:16,311
Look at me.
What am I going to do now?

627
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,398
What am I going to do now?

628
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,795
PFC Gump?

629
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,997
- Yes, sir!
- As you were.

630
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:42,675
Son, you been awarded
the Medal of Honour.

631
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:47,880
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan?
They want to give me a med...

632
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,637
Ma'am, what did they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

633
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,517
They sent him home.

634
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,911
Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.

635
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,470
The ceremony was kicked off
with a candid speech by the President

636
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:16,269
regarding the need for further
escalation of the war in Vietnam.

637
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,716
President Johnson awarded four medals
of honour to men from each...

638
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,519
America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.

639
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,075
I understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?

640
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,752
In the but-tocks, sir.

641
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:34,197
Well, that must be a sight.
I'd kinda like to see that.

642
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,312
God damn, son!

643
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,357
After that, Mama went
to the hotel to lay down,

644
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:58,228
so I went out for a walk
to see our capital.

645
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:03,030
Hilary! I got the vets.
What do you want to do with them?

646
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,509
It's a good thing Mama was resting,

647
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,398
'cause the streets was
awful crowded with people

648
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,278
lookin' at all the statues
and monuments,

649
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,430
and some of them people
were loud and pushy.

650
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,954
OK, follow me! Move it out!

651
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:19,271
Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.

652
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,830
Come on. Go!

653
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:40,916
You're a good man
for doing this. Good.

654
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,036
OK.

655
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,076
There was this man
giving a little talk.

656
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:49,472
And for some reason, he was wearing
an American flag for a shirt.

657
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:54,789
And he liked to say
the "F" Word a lot.

658
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,110
"F" This and "F" That.

659
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:02,513
And every time he said the "F" Word,
people, for some reason, cheered.

660
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,512
Come on, man. Come up here, man.

661
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:15,115
Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move!

662
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,477
Go on. Let's get up there.

663
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,313
Tell us a little bit
about the war, man.

664
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:39,714
- The war in Vietnam?
- The war in Viet-fuckin'-nam!

665
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,073
Well...

666
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:08,392
There was only one thing
I could say about the war in Vietnam.

667
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,598
There's only one thing
I can say about the war in Vietnam.

668
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,917
In Vietnam...

669
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,357
What the hell are you do...

670
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:33,193
I'll beat your head in,
you goddamn oinker!

671
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,589
Jesus Christ!
What did they do with this?

672
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,431
Can't hear you!

673
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,236
Can't hear anything!

674
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,197
This... This one! Give me that!

675
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,748
Speak up!

676
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,637
That's it.

677
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:53,236
And that's all I have to say
about that.

678
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,315
That's so right on, man.
You said it all.

679
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:08,834
- What's your name, man?
- My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.

680
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:12,232
- Forrest Gump.
- Gump!

681
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:53,309
It was the happiest moment
of my life.

682
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:58,229
Jenny and me were just
like peas and carrots again.

683
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:03,952
She showed me around and introduced
me to some of her new friends.

684
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:07,316
Shut that blind, man! And get your
white ass away from that window.

685
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,675
Don't you know we in a war here?

686
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,435
- He's cool. He's one of us.
- Let me tell you about us.

687
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,636
Our purpose here
is to protect our black leaders

688
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,631
from the racial onslaught of the pig

689
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,597
who wishes to brutalise
our black leaders,

690
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:23,559
rape our women,
and destroy our black communities.

691
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:28,793
- Who's the baby killer?
- This is my friend I told you about.

692
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,678
This is Forrest Gump.
Forrest, this is Wesley.

693
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,149
Wesley and I
lived together in Berkeley,

694
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,038
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

695
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:39,918
We are here to offer
protection and help

696
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,231
for all those who need our help,
because we, the Black Panthers,

697
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,675
are against the war in Vietnam.

698
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,718
We are against any war where black
soldiers are sent to the front line

699
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,597
to die for a country that hates them.

700
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,355
We are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

701
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:58,069
and come to be brutalised
and killed in their own communities.

702
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,675
We are against all these racist
and imperial acts...

703
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:19,909
Forrest! Stop it! Stop it!

704
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,788
I shouldn't have brought you here.

705
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,714
I should have known it was going
to be some bullshit hassle!

706
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,880
He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

707
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,676
Come on, Forrest.

708
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:54,036
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

709
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,353
He doesn't mean it
when he does things like this.

710
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,954
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

711
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:09,114
- I know you wouldn't, Forrest.
- I wanted to be your boyfriend.

712
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:25,792
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.
You look handsome in it. You do.

713
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,239
- You know what?
- What?

714
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,279
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

715
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,592
Me, too, Forrest.

716
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:46,356
We walked around all night,
Jenny and me, just talkin'.

717
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:51,631
She told me about
all the travelling she'd done

718
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:55,349
and how she discovered
ways to expand her mind

719
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:00,798
and learn how to live in harmony,
which must be out west somewhere,

720
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:04,429
'cause she made it
all the way to California.

721
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:09,593
Hey. Anybody
want to go to San Francisco?

722
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,638
- I'll go.
- Far out!

723
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:16,633
It was a very special night
for the two of us.

724
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,271
I didn't want it to end.

725
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:25,592
- Wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.
- I have to, Forrest.

726
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:31,836
Jenny?
Things got a little out of hand.

727
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:36,672
It's just this war and that lying
son of a bitch Johnson and...

728
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,833
I would never hurt you.
You know that.

729
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,471
Know what I think?

730
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:52,354
I think you should go home
to Greenbow, Alabama!

731
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:07,234
Forrest, we have very different
lives, you know.

732
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:19,116
I want you to have this.

733
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,316
Forrest, I can't keep this.

734
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:31,830
I got it just by doing
what you told me to do.

735
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:37,916
- Why are you so good to me?
- You're my girl.

736
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,630
I'll always be your girl.

737
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:25,438
And just like that,
she was gone out of my life again.

738
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:34,151
It's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.

739
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,917
I thought I was going back
to Vietnam, but instead they decided

740
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,073
the best way for me to fight
the communists was to play ping-pong,

741
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:50,755
so I was in the Special Services,
travelling around the country,

742
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:54,753
cheering up wounded veterans and
showing 'em how to play ping-pong.

743
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,353
I was so good,

744
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:59,716
the Army decided I should be
on the All-American ping-pong team.

745
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,956
We were the first Americans
to visit the land of China

746
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,871
in a million years or something.

747
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:08,758
Somebody said world peace
was in our hands,

748
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,354
but all I did was play ping-pong.

749
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:14,876
When I got home,
I was a national celebrity,

750
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,793
famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.

751
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,111
Here he is, Forrest Gump. Right here.

752
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:34,077
- Forrest Gump, John Lennon.
- Welcome home.

753
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:38,199
Can you tell us, what was China like?

754
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:45,598
In the land of China,
people hardly got nothin' at all.

755
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,432
No possessions?

756
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:54,231
And in China,
they never go to church.

757
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:58,871
- No religion, too?
- Hard to imagine.

758
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:02,472
Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.

759
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,757
Some years later,
that nice young man from England

760
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:10,516
was on his way home to see his little
boy and was signing some autographs.

761
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:14,912
For no particular reason at all,
somebody shot him.

762
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:21,199
They gave you
The Congressional Medal of Honour.

763
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,272
Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.

764
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,672
Lieutenant Dan!

765
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:33,550
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honour.

766
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,397
Yes, sir. They surely did.

767
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:41,793
They gave you, an imbecile,
a moron who goes on television

768
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:47,000
and makes a fool out of himself
in front of the whole damn country,

769
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,435
the Congressional Medal of Honour.

770
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,792
Yes, sir.

771
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,877
Well, that's just perfect!

772
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:03,308
Well, I just got one thing to say
to that. Goddamn bless America.

773
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,312
Lieutenant Dan!

774
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:16,836
Lieutenant Dan
said he was living in a hotel.

775
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:21,914
Because he didn't have no legs, he
spent his time exercising his arms.

776
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,871
Take a right. Take a right!

777
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:31,192
Come on, already!

778
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:34,511
What do you do here in New York,
Lieutenant Dan?

779
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,830
I'm living off the government tit.

780
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:45,478
Are you blind? I'm walking here!
Get out! Come on. Go, go, go!

781
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:56,512
I stayed with Lieutenant Dan
and celebrated the holidays.

782
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:04,631
You have a great year,
and hurry home. God bless you.

783
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,837
Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

784
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:13,913
I didn't know I was supposed
to be looking for him, sir.

785
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:26,354
That's all these cripples at the VA,
that's all they ever talk about.

786
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:34,149
Jesus this and Jesus that.
Have I found Jesus?

787
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:38,156
They even had a priest
come and talk to me.

788
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:43,633
He said God is listening,
but I have to help myself.

789
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,473
Now, if I accept Jesus into my heart,

790
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:50,712
I'll get to walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

791
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,030
Did you hear what I said?

792
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:58,432
Walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

793
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:04,550
Well, kiss my crippled ass. God
is listening? What a crock of shit.

794
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:10,075
I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.

795
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:18,959
Well...

796
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,274
Before you go, why don't you
get your ass down to the corner

797
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,033
- and get us more ripple?
- Yes, sir.

798
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:32,193
We're at approximately 45th street
in New York City at One Astor Plaza.

799
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,475
This is the site
of the old Astor Hotel...

800
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,348
- What the hell is in Bayou La Batre?
- Shrimping boats.

801
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,557
Shrimping boats? Who gives a shit
about shrimping boats?

802
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:45,428
I got to buy me one
soon as I have some money.

803
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,953
I promised Bubba in Vietnam

804
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,191
that as soon as the war was over,
we'd be partners.

805
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:53,670
He'd be the captain
and I'd be his first mate.

806
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:56,513
But now that he's dead,
I got to be the captain.

807
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,431
A shrimp boat captain.

808
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,557
Yes, sir. A promise is a promise,
Lieutenant Dan.

809
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:05,557
Now hear this!

810
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:11,198
Private Gump here is gonna be
a shrimp boat captain.

811
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,989
Tell you what, Gilligan. The day
you are a shrimp boat captain,

812
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,230
I will come and be your first mate.

813
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:23,395
If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,
that's the day I'm an astronaut!

814
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:26,631
Danny, what are you complaining
about? How you doing?

815
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:32,033
- Mr Hot Wheels. Who's your friend?
- My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.

816
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:36,272
This is Cunning Carla
and Long-limbs Lenore.

817
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:40,069
So where you been, babycakes?
Haven't seen you around lately.

818
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,549
You should have been here
for Christmas,

819
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,394
'cause Tommy bought a free round
and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.

820
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,277
Well, I had company.

821
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:52,154
We was just there!
That's Times Square.

822
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:56,950
Don't you just love New Year's?
You can start all over.

823
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,634
Everybody gets a second chance.

824
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,958
It's funny,
but in the middle of all that fun,

825
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,951
I began to think about Jenny,

826
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:09,477
wondering how she was spending her
New Year's night out in California.

827
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,270
Nine, eight, seven, six,

828
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:40,230
five, four, three, two, one!
Happy New Year!

829
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,598
Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!

830
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:36,594
What are you, stupid or something?
What's your problem?

831
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:41,435
What's his problem? Did you lose
your packet in the war or something?

832
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:44,273
- Is your friend stupid or something?
- What did you say?

833
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:46,590
I said is your friend
stupid or something?

834
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,433
- Don't call him stupid!
- Hey, don't push her!

835
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,353
You shut up!
Don't you ever call him stupid!

836
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,670
Why you so upset?

837
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:58,150
Get your goddamn clothes
and get the hell out of here!

838
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:01,277
You should be in a sideshow.
You're so pathetic!

839
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:02,759
Get out of here!

840
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:06,196
- You retard!
- Loser. You freak!

841
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,312
Oh, no.

842
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:40,232
I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's
Eve party, Lieutenant Dan.

843
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,595
She tastes like cigarettes.

844
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:02,716
I guess Lieutenant Dan figured
there's some things you can't change.

845
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:05,633
He didn't want to be called crippled

846
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:09,030
like I didn't want
to be called stupid.

847
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,030
Happy New Year, Gump.

848
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,389
The U.S. Ping-pong team met
with President Nixon today...

849
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,836
Wouldn't you know it?
A few months later,

850
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,072
they invited me and the ping-pong
team to visit the White House.

851
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:33,038
So I went, again.

852
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:36,556
And I met the President
of the United States again.

853
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:40,633
Only this time, they didn't get us
rooms in a real fancy hotel.

854
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:44,076
Are you enjoying yourself
in our nation's capital, young man?

855
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:47,197
- Where are you staying?
- It's called the Hotel Ebbott.

856
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,714
Oh, no. I know a much nicer hotel.

857
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:53,952
It's brand-new. Very modern.
I'll have my people take care of it.

858
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:56,554
- Security.
- Yeah. Sir...

859
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:01,760
You might want to send a maintenance
man to that office across the way.

860
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:06,118
The lights are off and they must be
looking for a fuse box,

861
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:09,033
'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

862
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:12,635
- OK, sir. I'll check it out.
- Thank you. Good night.

863
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:18,596
Therefore,
I shall resign the presidency

864
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:22,832
effective at noon tomorrow.
Vice President Ford

865
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:27,550
will be sworn in as President
at that hour in this office.

866
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:41,073
- Forrest Gump.
- Yes, sir!

867
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:46,757
As you were. I have your
discharge papers. Service is up, son.

868
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:51,637
Does this mean
I can't play ping-pong no more?

869
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,631
For the Army, it does.

870
01:21:55,520 --> 01:22:00,833
And just like that, my service
in the United States Army was over.

871
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,031
So I went home.

872
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:31,799
- I'm home, Mama.
- I know. I know.

873
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,553
Louise, he's here.

874
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:38,553
When I got home, I had no idea,
but Mama'd had all sorts of visitors.

875
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:41,200
We've had all sorts of visitors.

876
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,919
Everybody wants you to use
their ping-pong stuff.

877
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,549
One man even left a check for $25,000

878
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:51,269
if you'd be agreeable to saying
you like using their paddle.

879
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,669
I only like using my own paddle.

880
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,796
- Hi, Miss Louise.
- Hey, Forrest.

881
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:59,509
I know that,
but it's $25,000, Forrest.

882
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,797
I thought maybe
you could hold it for a while,

883
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,269
see if it grows on you.

884
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:09,751
That Mama, she sure was right.
It's funny how things work out.

885
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,751
I didn't stay home for long

886
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:16,595
because I'd made a promise to Bubba,
and I always try to keep my promise,

887
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:20,389
so I went on down to Bayou La Batre
to meet Bubba's family.

888
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:24,758
Are you crazy or just plain stupid?

889
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:28,753
- Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs Blue.
- I guess.

890
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:33,357
And, of course,
I paid my respect to Bubba himself.

891
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,074
Hey, Bubba. It's me, Forrest Gump.

892
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:44,955
I remember everything you said,
and I got it all figured out.

893
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:54,030
I'm taking $24,562.47 that I got,

894
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:57,396
that's left after a new haircut
and a new suit

895
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:00,313
and I took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,

896
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,153
and I bought a bus ticket,
and three Dr Peppers.

897
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:07,552
Tell me something.
Are you stupid or something?

898
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:10,108
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

899
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:11,997
That's what's left after me saying,

900
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:15,868
"When I was in China
on the All-America ping-pong team,

901
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,757
"I just loved playing ping-pong

902
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,910
"with my Flex-o-lite
ping-pong paddle,"

903
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,956
which everybody knows isn't true,

904
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:25,953
but Mama said it was just a little
white lie, it wasn't hurting nobody.

905
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:30,079
So anyway,
I'm putting all that on gas, ropes,

906
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:34,153
and new nets
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

907
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,757
Bubba told me everything
he knew about shrimping,

908
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,638
but you know what I found out?

909
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,240
Shrimping is tough.

910
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,640
I only caught five.

911
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:12,076
A couple more,
you can have yourself a cocktail.

912
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:16,553
You ever think about
naming this old boat?

913
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:19,393
It's bad luck
to have a boat without a name.

914
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,710
I'd never named a boat before,

915
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:26,635
but there was only one
I could think of,

916
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:30,508
the most beautiful name
in the wide world.

917
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:56,352
I hadn't heard from Jenny in a long
while, but I thought about her a lot.

918
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:59,238
I hoped whatever she was doing
made her happy.

919
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:44,237
I thought about Jenny all the time.

920
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:35,676
Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?

921
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,752
Well, thought I'd try out
my sea legs.

922
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:41,752
Well, you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.

923
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:47,233
Yes, I know that.
You wrote me a letter, you idiot.

924
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:52,474
Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.
I had to see this for myself.

925
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:59,471
And I told you if you were
ever a shrimp boat captain,

926
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:02,870
that I'd be your first mate.
Well, here I am.

927
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:05,872
- I'm a man of my word.
- OK.

928
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:09,794
But don't you be thinking that
I'm going to be calling you "Sir."

929
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,950
No, sir.

930
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,790
That's my boat.

931
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:28,079
I have a feeling if we head due east,

932
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:31,630
we'll find some shrimp.
So take a left.

933
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:35,235
- Take a left!
- Which way?

934
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:37,754
Over there! They're over there!

935
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:42,470
- Get on the wheel and take a left.
- OK.

936
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:48,032
Gump, what are you doing?
Take a left! Left!

937
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:53,713
That's where we're going
to find those shrimp, my boy!

938
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,511
That's where we'll find them.

939
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:12,354
- Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.
- OK, so I was wrong.

940
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:15,238
How are we going to find them?

941
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:18,949
Maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.

942
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:27,514
So I went to church every Sunday.

943
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:34,478
Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came too,
though he left the praying up to me.

944
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:53,680
- No shrimp.
- Where the hell's this God of yours?

945
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:58,595
It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that,
'cause right then God showed up.

946
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:17,229
You'll never sink this boat!

947
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:23,190
Now, me, I was scared,
but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.

948
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,589
Come on!

949
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:33,112
You call this a storm?
Come on, you son of a bitch!

950
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:42,070
It's time for a showdown! You and me!
I'm right here! Come and get me!

951
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:47,869
You'll never sink this boat!

952
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:51,996
Hurricane Carmen
came through here yesterday,

953
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,150
destroying nearly everything
in its path.

954
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:57,038
And as in other towns
up and down the coast,

955
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,554
Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industry

956
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:04,634
has fallen victim to Carmen
and has been left in utter ruin.

957
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,233
This reporter has learned,

958
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:09,995
in fact, only one shrimping boat
actually survived the storm.

959
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:12,435
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

960
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:15,478
After that, shrimping was easy.

961
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:23,918
Since people still needed
them shrimps for shrimp cocktails

962
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,152
and barbecues and all, and we were
the only boat left standing,

963
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:33,394
Bubba-Gump shrimp's what they got.
We got a whole bunch of boats.

964
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:35,471
Twelve Jennys, big old warehouse.

965
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:39,678
We even have hats
that say "Bubba-Gump" on them.

966
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,274
Bubba-Gump Shrimp. A household name.

967
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,032
Hold on there, boy.

968
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:48,636
Are you telling me you're the owner
of the Bubba-Gump Shrimp Corporation?

969
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:51,518
Yes. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.

970
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:56,628
Boy, I heard some whoppers
in my time, but that tops them all.

971
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:02,476
We were sitting
next to a millionaire.

972
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:10,235
Well, I thought it was
a very lovely story,

973
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:15,235
and you tell it so well,
with such enthusiasm.

974
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:19,154
Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

975
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:21,470
Yes, I would.

976
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,352
That's him right there.

977
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:32,158
Let me tell you something
about Lieutenant Dan.

978
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:42,673
I never thanked you
for saving my life.

979
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:13,350
He never actually said so, but
I think he made his peace with God.

980
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:22,632
For the second time in 17 days,

981
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:26,156
President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.

982
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:30,677
- Base to Jenny 1. Base to Jenny 1.
- Jenny 1. Go, Margo.

983
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,591
Forrest has a phone call.

984
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:35,069
Well, you'll have to tell them
to call him back.

985
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:39,517
- He is indisposed at the moment.
- His mama's sick.

986
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:00,517
- Where's Mama?
- She's upstairs.

987
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,550
Hi, Forrest.

988
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:08,076
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

989
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:17,795
Sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?

990
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:32,758
- What's the matter, Mama?
- I'm dying, Forrest.

991
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:37,878
Come on in, sit down over here.

992
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:57,268
- Why are you dying, Mama?
- It's my time. It's just my time.

993
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:03,119
Now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart.

994
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:09,749
Death is just a part of life.
Something we're all destined to do.

995
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:15,994
I didn't know it,
but I was destined to be your mama.

996
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:20,551
- I did the best I could.
- You did good.

997
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:26,317
Well, I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.

998
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:31,151
You have to do the best
with what God gave you.

999
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,994
What's my destiny, Mama?

1000
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:41,358
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

1001
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:45,473
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.

1002
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:48,313
You never know
what you're going to get.

1003
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:52,473
Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.

1004
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,516
I will miss you, Forrest.

1005
01:36:56,120 --> 01:37:00,238
She had got the cancer
and died on a Tuesday.

1006
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:04,836
I bought her a new hat
with little flowers on it.

1007
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:10,792
And that's all
I have to say about that.

1008
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:19,953
Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number seven bus?

1009
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:23,112
There'll be another one
along shortly.

1010
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:30,158
Now, because I had been
a football star and war hero

1011
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:33,073
and national celebrity
and a shrimping boat captain

1012
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:36,869
and a college graduate, the city
fathers of Greenbow, Alabama,

1013
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:39,554
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

1014
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:44,192
So I never went back
to work for Lieutenant Dan,

1015
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,953
though he did take care
of my Bubba-Gump money.

1016
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:51,272
He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.

1017
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:54,875
I got a call from him saying we don't
have to worry about money no more,

1018
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:59,158
and I said,
"That's good. One less thing."

1019
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:04,999
Now Mama said there's only
so much fortune a man really needs,

1020
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:08,311
and the rest is just for showing off.

1021
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:13,713
So I gave a whole bunch of it
to the Foursquare Gospel Church.

1022
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:19,275
And I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre fishing hospital.

1023
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:26,317
And even though Bubba was dead
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,

1024
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:30,075
I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.

1025
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,912
You know what?

1026
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,834
She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.

1027
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,309
That smells wonderful.

1028
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:45,520
And 'cause I was a gozillionaire
and I liked doing it so much,

1029
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,670
I cut that grass for free.

1030
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:53,630
But at night-time
when there was nothing to do

1031
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:58,555
and the house was all empty,
I'd always think of Jenny.

1032
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:03,190
And then, she was there.

1033
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:38,475
- Hello, Forrest.
- Hello, Jenny.

1034
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:51,758
Jenny came back and stayed with me.

1035
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:56,470
Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,

1036
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:00,348
or maybe it was because she was
so tired, 'cause she went to bed

1037
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:04,877
and slept and slept,
like she hadn't slept in years.

1038
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,676
It was wonderful having her home.

1039
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:14,029
Every day we'd take a walk, and I'd
jabber on like a monkey in a tree,

1040
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:16,873
and she'd listen about
ping-ponging and shrimping

1041
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:20,748
and Mama making a trip up to heaven.
I did all the talking.

1042
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:24,116
Jenny most of the time
was real quiet.

1043
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:04,833
How could you do this?

1044
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:44,797
Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.

1045
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:50,512
I never really knew
why she came back, but I didn't care.

1046
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:55,151
It was like olden times.
We was like peas and carrots again.

1047
01:42:56,520 --> 01:43:00,479
Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers
and put them in her room for her,

1048
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:06,997
and she gave me the best gift anyone
could ever get in the wide world.

1049
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:09,036
They're just for running.

1050
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:15,637
And she even showed me how to dance.

1051
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:29,033
Well, we was like family,
Jenny and me...

1052
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:34,997
and it was the happiest time
in my life.

1053
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:02,159
You done watching it?
I'm going to bed.

1054
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:14,830
Will you marry me?

1055
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:22,116
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1056
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:26,477
You would, Forrest.

1057
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:30,510
But you won't marry me.

1058
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:35,079
You don't want to marry me.

1059
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:40,349
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1060
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:51,037
I'm not a smart man,
but I know what love is.

1061
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:32,953
Forrest, I do love you.

1062
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:28,153
- Where are you running off to?
- I'm not running.

1063
01:47:55,040 --> 01:48:00,398
That day, for no particular reason,
I decided to go for a little run.

1064
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:04,429
So I ran to the end of the road,
and when I got there

1065
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:07,080
I thought maybe I'd run
to the end of town.

1066
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:09,879
President Carter,
suffering from heat exhaustion...

1067
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:11,678
And when I got there,

1068
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:15,753
I thought maybe I'd just
run across Greenbow County.

1069
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:18,229
Now, thinking since I'd run this far,

1070
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:21,995
maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.

1071
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:25,595
And that's what I did.
I ran clear across Alabama.

1072
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:29,195
No particular reason.
I just kept on going.

1073
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:31,911
I ran clear to the ocean.

1074
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:41,199
And when I got there,
I figured since I'd gone this far,

1075
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:44,352
might as well turn around,
just keep on going.

1076
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:51,952
And when I got to another ocean,
I figured since I'd gone this far,

1077
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:57,396
I might as well just turn back
and keep right on going.

1078
01:48:57,480 --> 01:49:02,759
When I got tired, I slept.
When I got hungry, I ate.

1079
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:08,233
When I had to go...
you know... I went.

1080
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:13,993
- And so, you just ran.
- Yeah.

1081
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:53,952
I'd think a lot about Mama
and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.

1082
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:59,990
But most of all, I thought about
Jenny. I thought about her a lot.

1083
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:05,149
For more than two years,
a man named Forrest Gump,

1084
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:07,800
a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
stopping only to sleep,

1085
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:12,112
has been running across America.
Charles Cooper reports.

1086
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:15,317
For the fourth time
on his journey across America,

1087
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:19,996
Forrest Gump the gardener will cross
the Mississippi River again today.

1088
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:24,750
- I'll be damned. Forrest?
- Why are you running?

1089
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:28,230
- Are you doing this for world peace?
- For the homeless?

1090
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:31,118
- Are you running for women's rights?
- The environment?

1091
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:35,910
They couldn't believe somebody would
do all that running for no reason.

1092
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,118
- Why are you doing this?
- I just felt like running.

1093
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:41,713
I just felt like runnin'.

1094
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:46,230
It's you.
I can't believe it's really you.

1095
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:51,599
For some reason, what I was doing
seemed to make sense to people.

1096
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:53,989
It was like an alarm
went off in my head.

1097
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:57,550
I said, "Here's a guy
that's got his act together.

1098
01:50:57,640 --> 01:51:01,394
"Here's somebody who has the answer."
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr Gump.

1099
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:03,675
So I got company.

1100
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:10,951
And after that, I got more company.
And then, even more people joined in.

1101
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:16,032
Somebody later told me
it gave people hope.

1102
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:21,316
I don't know anything about that,

1103
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:25,757
but some of those people asked me
if I could help them out.

1104
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:30,152
I was wondering if you might help me.
I'm in the bumper sticker business.

1105
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:33,596
I need a good slogan, and since
you've been so inspirational,

1106
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:36,114
I thought
you might be able to help me...

1107
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:40,193
Whoa, man! You just ran
through a big pile of dog shit!

1108
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:45,279
- It happens.
- What, shit?

1109
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:47,112
Sometimes.

1110
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:52,236
And some years later, I heard
that that fella did come up

1111
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:56,552
with a bumper sticker slogan
and made a lot of money off of it.

1112
01:51:56,640 --> 01:51:58,835
Another time, I was running along,

1113
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:01,559
somebody who'd lost all his money
in the t-shirt business,

1114
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:04,837
he wanted to put my face
on a t-shirt,

1115
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:08,674
but he couldn't draw that well,
and he didn't have a camera.

1116
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:12,150
Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that colour anyway.

1117
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:17,872
Have a nice day.

1118
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:22,876
Some years later,
I found out that that man did come up

1119
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:26,748
with an idea for a t-shirt.
He made a lot of money.

1120
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:33,870
Anyway, like I was saying,
I had a lot of company.

1121
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:40,229
Mama always said, "Put the past
behind you before you can move on."

1122
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:44,434
And I think
that's what my running was all about.

1123
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:51,870
I had run for three years,
two months, 14 days and 16 hours.

1124
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:09,110
Quiet. Quiet.
He's going to say something.

1125
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:22,635
I'm pretty tired.

1126
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:27,189
Think I'll go home now.

1127
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:46,394
Now what are we supposed to do?

1128
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:52,355
And just like that,
my runnin' days was over.

1129
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:54,590
So I went home to Alabama.

1130
01:53:56,280 --> 01:54:00,432
Moments ago, at 2.25 p.m., as
President Reagan was leaving the...

1131
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:06,194
...five or six gunshots were fired
by an unknown would-be assassin.

1132
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:08,475
The President was shot
in the chest...

1133
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:10,312
I picked up the mail.

1134
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:14,837
And one day, out of the blue clear
sky, I got a letter from Jenny

1135
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:18,595
wondering if I could come down
to Savannah and see her,

1136
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:20,671
and that's what I'm doing here.

1137
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:23,951
She saw me on TV, running.

1138
01:54:24,040 --> 01:54:28,272
I'm supposed to go on the number nine
bus to Richmond Street

1139
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:34,959
and get off and go one block left
to 1947 Henry Street, apartment 4.

1140
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:38,396
Why, you don't need to take a bus.

1141
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:43,315
Henry Street is just five
or six blocks down that way.

1142
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:47,073
- Down that way?
- Down that way.

1143
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:51,195
It was nice talking to you.

1144
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:55,709
I hope everything works out for you!

1145
01:55:06,680 --> 01:55:11,196
- How you doin'? Come in! Come in!
- I got your letter.

1146
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:17,037
- I was wondering about that.
- This your house?

1147
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:20,078
Yeah. It's messy right now.
I just got off work.

1148
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:23,835
It's nice. You got air conditioning.

1149
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:32,951
- Thank you.
- I ate some.

1150
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:40,790
I kept a scrapbook of your clippings,
and everything. There you are.

1151
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:44,471
And this, I got you running.

1152
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:51,311
I ran a long way. It's a long time.

1153
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:55,716
And there...

1154
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:04,830
Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this.

1155
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:12,518
I just I want to apologise
for anything that I ever did to you

1156
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:16,434
'cause I was messed up
for a long time, and...

1157
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:22,599
- Hi.
- Hey, you.

1158
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:25,638
- This is an old friend from Alabama.
- How do you do?

1159
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:29,110
Next week my schedule changes,
so I can...

1160
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:31,395
No problem. Got to go.
I'm double-parked.

1161
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:33,277
OK. Thanks.

1162
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:38,669
This is my very good friend Mr Gump.
Can you say hi?

1163
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:41,115
- Hello, Mr Gump.
- Hello.

1164
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:45,079
- Can I go watch TV now?
- Yes. Just keep it low.

1165
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:50,272
- You're a mama, Jenny.
- I'm a mama.

1166
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:57,155
- His name's Forrest.
- Like me!

1167
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:04,036
- I named him after his daddy.
- He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

1168
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:07,955
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1169
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:27,316
Forrest, look at me.
Look at me, Forrest.

1170
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:34,277
There's nothing you need to do.
You didn't do anything wrong. OK?

1171
01:57:38,680 --> 01:57:40,432
Isn't he beautiful?

1172
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:45,673
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1173
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:50,192
But...

1174
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:55,316
Is he smart? Can he...

1175
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:59,791
He's very smart. He's one
of the smartest in his class.

1176
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:10,593
Yeah, it's OK. Go talk to him.

1177
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:22,876
- What are you watching?
- Bert and Ernie.

1178
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:48,678
Forrest, I'm sick.

1179
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:54,476
What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?

1180
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:59,634
I have some virus, and the doctors,
they don't know what it is,

1181
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:02,757
and there isn't
anything they can do about it.

1182
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:09,834
You could come home with me.

1183
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:17,149
You and little Forrest could
come stay at my house in Greenbow.

1184
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:23,398
I'll take care of you if you're sick.

1185
01:59:24,840 --> 01:59:27,513
Would you marry me, Forrest?

1186
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:33,953
OK.

1187
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:37,079
Please take your seats.

1188
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:43,312
Forrest? It's time to start.

1189
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:04,551
Hi. Your tie.

1190
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:19,155
Lieutenant Dan.

1191
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:37,199
- Lieutenant Dan.
- Hello, Forrest.

1192
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:41,235
You got new legs. New legs!

1193
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:46,109
Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.

1194
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:50,352
Titanium alloy. It's what they use
on the space shuttle.

1195
02:00:53,600 --> 02:00:55,556
Magic legs.

1196
02:00:57,320 --> 02:01:01,632
This is my fiancée, Susan.

1197
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:08,551
- Lieutenant Dan.
- Hi, Forrest.

1198
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:15,557
- Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.
- Hi. It's nice to meet you finally.

1199
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:29,593
Do you, Forrest, take Jenny
to be your wife?

1200
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:35,233
Do you, Jenny,
take Forrest to be your husband?

1201
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:40,076
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

1202
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:12,433
- Hey.
- Hi.

1203
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:33,234
Were you scared in Vietnam?

1204
02:02:34,520 --> 02:02:38,877
Yes. Well, I don't know.

1205
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:45,239
Sometimes it would stop raining long
enough for the stars to come out.

1206
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:49,837
And then it was nice.

1207
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:57,392
It was like just before the sun
goes to bed down on the bayou.

1208
02:02:57,480 --> 02:03:02,190
There was always
a million sparkles on the water.

1209
02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:07,355
Like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,

1210
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:12,594
it looked like there were two skies
one on top of the other.

1211
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:17,470
And then in the desert,
when the sun comes up,

1212
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:26,509
I couldn't tell where heaven stopped
and the earth began.

1213
02:03:27,880 --> 02:03:30,075
It was so beautiful.

1214
02:03:34,120 --> 02:03:36,918
I wish I could've been there
with you.

1215
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:41,951
You were.

1216
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:53,432
I love you.

1217
02:03:57,280 --> 02:04:00,317
You died on a Saturday morning.

1218
02:04:02,080 --> 02:04:06,073
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

1219
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:15,838
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.

1220
02:04:19,480 --> 02:04:26,397
Mama always said
that dyin' was a part of life.

1221
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:31,670
I sure wish it wasn't.

1222
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:38,519
Little Forrest is doing just fine.

1223
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:43,868
About to start school again soon,

1224
02:04:44,840 --> 02:04:48,992
and I make his breakfast,
lunch, and dinner every day.

1225
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:56,710
I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

1226
02:04:59,240 --> 02:05:05,110
Teaching him how to play ping-pong.
He's really good.

1227
02:05:05,200 --> 02:05:07,156
Forrest, you go.

1228
02:05:11,720 --> 02:05:13,836
We fish a lot.

1229
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:20,715
And every night, we read a book.
He's so smart, Jenny.

1230
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:27,835
You'd be so proud of him. I am.

1231
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:32,118
He wrote you a letter.

1232
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:35,636
And he says I can't read it.

1233
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:39,599
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

1234
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:07,236
I don't know if mama was right
or if it's Lieutenant Dan.

1235
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:14,719
I don't know if
we each have a destiny,

1236
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:21,319
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze.

1237
02:06:25,560 --> 02:06:30,350
But I think maybe it's both.

1238
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:38,111
Maybe both is happening
at the same time.

1239
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:45,437
But I miss you, Jenny.

1240
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:56,116
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

1241
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:33,275
Here's your bus. OK.

1242
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:37,191
I know this.

1243
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:39,953
I'm gonna share that for
show-and-tell

1244
02:07:40,040 --> 02:07:42,679
because Grandma
used to read it to you.

1245
02:07:42,760 --> 02:07:44,716
My favourite book.

1246
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:53,795
Here you go.

1247
02:08:00,520 --> 02:08:01,919
Don't...

1248
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:08,994
- I want to tell you I love you.
- I love you, too, Daddy.

1249
02:08:09,080 --> 02:08:12,152
I'll be right here when you get back.

1250
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:20,712
You understand this is
the bus to school, don't you?

1251
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:25,430
Of course, and you're Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump.
