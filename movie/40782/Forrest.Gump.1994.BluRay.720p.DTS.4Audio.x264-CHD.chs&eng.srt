1
00:03:19,496 --> 00:03:24,059
你好 我叫福雷斯 福雷斯甘
Hello. My name's Forrest - Forrest Gump.

2
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,943
要吃巧克力吗?
Do you want a chocolate?

3
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:38,952
我能吃掉上百万块巧克力
I could eat about a million and a half of these.

4
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,954
我妈妈常说
My mama always said

5
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:44,754
人生就像一盒各式各样的巧克力
Life was like a box of chocolates.

6
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:48,956
你永远不知道下一块将会是哪种
You never know what you're going to get.

7
00:03:56,374 --> 00:03:59,309
那双鞋子一定很舒适
Those must be comfortable shoes.

8
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:02,745
穿这样的鞋子你可以走上一整天
I bet you could walk all day in shoes like that

9
00:04:02,816 --> 00:04:04,750
脚都不会痛
and not feel a thing.

10
00:04:06,988 --> 00:04:10,424
我希望能有一双这样的鞋子
I wish I had shoes like that.

11
00:04:10,492 --> 00:04:12,926
其实我的脚很痛
My feet hurt .

12
00:04:12,995 --> 00:04:14,929
妈妈常说要想知道一个人的很多事情
Mama always said there's an awful lot

13
00:04:14,998 --> 00:04:18,934
只要看看他穿的鞋就能知道
you can tell about a person by their shoes.

14
00:04:19,003 --> 00:04:20,937
他会往哪里走
Where they're going,

15
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:22,472
他住在哪里
where they've been.

16
00:04:29,515 --> 00:04:32,075
我穿过很多双鞋子
I've worn lots of shoes.

17
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:36,956
如果我仔细想的话
I bet if I think about it real hard

18
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:39,459
我能记得我第一双鞋子的模样
I could remember my first pair of shoes.

19
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,260
妈妈说它会带我到任何地方
Mama said they'd take me anywhere .

20
00:04:45,394 --> 00:04:48,420
她说它是双魔鞋
She said they was my magic shoes.

21
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:51,934
好的 福雷斯 张开双眼
All right, Forrest, Open your eyes now .

22
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,307
你走几步看看
Let's take a little walk around.

23
00:05:07,955 --> 00:05:09,547
感觉如何？
How do those feel?

24
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:15,260
他的双腿很强壮 甘太太
His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,

25
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:17,765
是我见过最强壮的
as strong as I've ever seen.

26
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:21,895
但是他的背象政客一样弯
But his back's as crooked as a politician.

27
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:25,340
但我们会让他再直起来 对吧？
But we're going to straighten him right up, aren't we, Forrest?

28
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:26,673
福雷斯！
Forrest!

29
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:29,407
我刚出世时
Now, when I was a baby,

30
00:05:29,482 --> 00:05:32,246
妈用了一位内战英雄的名字为我取名
Mama named me after the great Civil War hero

31
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,320
内森贝弗福雷斯将军
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

32
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,412
内森贝弗福雷斯将军
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

33
00:05:34,488 --> 00:05:37,924
她说我们有点亲戚关系
She said we was related to him in some way.

34
00:05:37,993 --> 00:05:39,426
他做过的事情是：
What he did was,

35
00:05:39,494 --> 00:05:42,930
建立了一个俱乐部叫三Ｋ党
he tarted up this club called the Ku Klux Klan.

36
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:46,435
他们全披着长袍和床单
They'd all dress up in their robes and their bed sheets

37
00:05:46,503 --> 00:05:50,941
看来像一群鬼
and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something.

38
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:54,945
他们还在马上也披了床单四处跑
They'd even put bed sheets on their horses and ride around.

39
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:59,075
不管怎样 这就是我名字的由来：福雷斯甘
And, anyway, that'show I got my name... Forrest Gump.

40
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:02,485
妈妈说这名字是提醒我
Mama said the Forrest part was to remind me

41
00:06:02,556 --> 00:06:05,491
我们会经常做一些
that sometimes we all do things that, well,

42
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,994
并没有意义的事情
that just don't make no sense.

43
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,893
向这边！
This way. Hold on. Ugh!

44
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,123
好了
All right.

45
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:24,132
你们在看什么？
What are y'all staring at?

46
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:25,634
从来没有见过
Haven't you ever seen

47
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:28,694
小孩子戴脚撑的吗？
a little boy with braces on his legs before ?

48
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:31,374
不要管其它人
Don't ever let anybody

49
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:33,876
说他们比你强 福雷斯
tell you they're better than you, Forrest.

50
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:36,380
如果上帝要让人人都一样的话
If God intended everybody to be the same,

51
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:39,384
他会给每人一双脚撑
he'd have given us all braces on our legs.

52
00:06:39,452 --> 00:06:43,388
妈妈总有办法让我明白她的意思
Mama always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them.

53
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:47,926
我们住在17号公路附近
We lived about a quarter mile off Route 17,

54
00:06:47,996 --> 00:06:50,931
距离亚拉巴马州绿茵镇约半哩
about a half mile from the town of Greenbow, Alabama.

55
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,935
这个地方属于绿茵县
That's in the county of Greenbow.

56
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:56,438
我们的房子来自妈妈的家族
Our house had been in Mama's family

57
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:58,566
从她爷爷的爷爷的爷爷传下来的
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa

58
00:06:58,643 --> 00:07:02,079
他大概在一千年前飘洋过海来这里
had come across the ocean about a thousand years ago.

59
00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:04,514
房子只有我和妈妈住
Since it was just me and Mama

60
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,517
我们有好多空房间
and we had all these empty rooms,

61
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:09,020
妈妈将这些空房出租
Mama decided to let those rooms out,

62
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:10,522
给路过的人住
mostly to people passing through,

63
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,186
比如从莫比镇、或蒙哥马利镇来的人
Like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, places like that.

64
00:07:14,263 --> 00:07:17,198
我和妈妈靠这个挣到钱
That's how me and Mama got money.

65
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:20,030
妈妈是个很聪明的女士
Mama was a real smart lady.

66
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:22,037
记住我说的话,福雷斯
Remember what I told you, Forrest.

67
00:07:22,105 --> 00:07:25,131
你和其它任何人是一样的
You're no different than anybody else is.

68
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:29,879
听清楚了没有 福雷斯？
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?

69
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:32,382
你和其它人是一样的
You're the same as everybody else.

70
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,385
你并没有什么不一样
You are no different.

71
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:39,118
你的孩子有点不一样 甘太太
Your boy's...different, Mrs. Gump.

72
00:07:39,194 --> 00:07:41,628
他的智商只有75
His I.Q is 75.

73
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:44,221
我们都是不一样的
Well, we're all different,

74
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,562
汉考克先生
Mr. Hancock.

75
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:51,239
她希望我得到最好的教育
She wanted me to have the finest education

76
00:07:51,308 --> 00:07:54,744
所以她带我去绿茵县中心学校
so she took me to the Greenbow County Central School.

77
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:57,747
我见到了校长什么的
I met the principal and all.

78
00:07:57,816 --> 00:08:01,081
请你看看这个 甘太太
I want to show you something, Mrs. Gump.

79
00:08:01,154 --> 00:08:03,554
这是正常水平
Now, this is normal.

80
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:08,618
福雷斯则是在这儿
Forrest is right here .

81
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,530
州政府要求智商起码要80
The state require s a minimum I.Q of 80

82
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,329
才能上公立学校
to attend public school.

83
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:14,699
甘太太
Mrs. Gump,

84
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,671
他应该上特殊学校
he's going to have to go to a special school.

85
00:08:17,741 --> 00:08:20,175
在那里他会很好的
Now, he'll be just fine.

86
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:22,678
正常水平是什么意思?
What does normal mean anyway ?

87
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:24,681
他可能…
He might be...

88
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:26,876
反应不太灵敏
a bit on the slow side,

89
00:08:26,952 --> 00:08:28,385
但我儿子福雷斯
but my boy Forrest

90
00:08:28,454 --> 00:08:31,389
应该和其它人一样得到机会
is going to get the same opportunities as everyone else.

91
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,551
他不该去特殊学校
He's not going to some special school

92
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:35,562
学怎么翻修轮胎
to learn how to retread tires.

93
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,622
这不过是区区5分的问题
We're talking about five little points here .

94
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:43,370
一定会有办法解决的
There must be something can be done.

95
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:47,900
我们的学校是要排名次的
We're a progressive school system.

96
00:08:47,978 --> 00:08:50,742
我们不想有人拉后腿
We don't want to see anybody left behind.

97
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:55,583
甘先生在哪儿 甘太太？
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

98
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:00,335
他去度假了
He's on vacation.

99
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:21,325
你妈妈真是很关心你的教育 孩子
Well, your mama sure does care about your schooling, son.

100
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,528
你不太会说话 是吗？
You don't say much, do you?

101
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:43,126
“最后 他必须去试一试
"Finally, he had to try.

102
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,135
“看起来容易 但是…
"It looked easy, but...

103
00:09:46,204 --> 00:09:48,798
“发生了怪事 首先他们…
oh, what happened. First they..."

104
00:09:48,874 --> 00:09:52,139
妈妈 度假是什么意思？
Mama, what's vacation mean?

105
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:53,473
度假？
Vacation?

106
00:09:53,547 --> 00:09:55,310
爸爸去哪儿了？
Where Daddy went?

107
00:09:57,218 --> 00:09:59,982
度假就是你去一个地方…
Vacation's when you go somewhere...

108
00:10:02,391 --> 00:10:04,655
然后就不再回来
and you don't ever come back.

109
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:10,666
总之 我想你可以说
Anyway, I guess you could say

110
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,295
我和妈妈无依无靠
me and Mama was on our own.

111
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,338
但我们不介意
But we didn't mind.

112
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,841
我们的房子总住满了人
Our house was never empty.

113
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,845
经常是人来人往的
There was always folks coming and going.

114
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,005
开饭！
Supper!

115
00:10:22,082 --> 00:10:23,515
大家来吃晚饭啦！
It's supper, everyone!

116
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:25,108
这看起来很特别
That sure looks special.

117
00:10:25,185 --> 00:10:28,018
有时有这么多人和我们一起住
Sometimes, we had so many people staying with us

118
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:31,525
每个房间都住满了旅客
that every room was filled, with travelers, you know,

119
00:10:31,594 --> 00:10:34,028
这些人带着行李箱子
folks living out of their suitcases

120
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:37,532
还有帽子箱子 还有样品箱子
and hat cases and sample cases.

121
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:41,298
福雷斯甘 吃晚饭了！福雷斯？
Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest?

122
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:44,205
有一次 又有位年青人和我们住一起
One time, a young man was staying with us,

123
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:47,370
他带着一个吉它箱子
and he had him a guitar case.

124
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:55,718
“你从来逮不到兔子”
# Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit #

125
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,383
“你也不是…”
# And you ain't no #

126
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:58,983
“我的朋友”
# Friend of mine #

127
00:11:00,863 --> 00:11:02,455
福雷斯
Forrest,

128
00:11:02,532 --> 00:11:05,296
叫你不要打扰这位叔叔
I told you not to bother this nice young man.

129
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:06,802
不 没关系 太太
No, that's all right, ma'am.

130
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,306
我在弹吉它给他听
I was showing him a thing or two on the guitar.

131
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,310
好吧 你可以来吃晚饭了
All right. Supper's ready if y'all want to eat.

132
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:16,314
行 好极了 谢谢你 太太
Yeah, that sounds good.  Thank you, ma'am.

133
00:11:16,382 --> 00:11:19,818
喂 兄弟 请你再表演一遍刚才那步法
Say, man, show me that crazy little walk you did there .

134
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:21,319
稍微慢一点
Slow it down some.

135
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,857
“你只不过是…”
# You ain't nothing but... #

136
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:26,223
我喜欢那吉它
I liked that guitar.

137
00:11:26,295 --> 00:11:28,889
它很好听
It sounded good.

138
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:34,199
我伴着音乐移动着脚步
I started moving around to the music,

139
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,205
扭着我的臀部
swinging my hips.

140
00:11:36,273 --> 00:11:38,366
“哭喊不停”
# Cryin' all the time #

141
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:39,933
那天晚上
This one night,

142
00:11:40,011 --> 00:11:41,945
我和妈妈出去购物
me and Mama was out shopping,

143
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:44,448
我们路过文斯家私商店
and we walked by Vincy's Furniture and Appliance Store,

144
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:45,506
你猜怎么着？
and guess what?

145
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:51,992
“你只不过是一条猎犬”
# You ain't nothin' but a hound dog #

146
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,120
“哭喊不停”
# Cryin' all the time #

147
00:11:56,832 --> 00:11:58,766
“你只不过是一条猎犬”
# You ain't nothin' but a hound dog #

148
00:11:58,835 --> 00:12:01,736
小孩子不能看这个
This is not for children's eyes.

149
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,864
“哭喊不停”
# Cryin' all the time #

150
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:05,374
几年以后 
Some years later,

151
00:12:05,443 --> 00:12:08,378
听说那位帅哥被人称为“猫王”
that handsome young man who they called the King,

152
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:11,348
嗯 他唱的歌实在太多
well, he sung too many songs.

153
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:14,352
结果他得了心脏病什么的
Had him self a heart attack or something.

154
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,412
看来“王”确实是不好当啊
It must be hard being a king.

155
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:23,363
你知道 你的记忆有时清楚得不得了
You know, it's funny how you remember some things,

156
00:12:23,432 --> 00:12:24,364
有时却什么也不记得
but some things you can't.

157
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:27,900
你要开始努力学习了 福雷斯
You do your very best now, Forrest.

158
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:30,371
我一定会的 妈妈
I sure will, Mama.

159
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,967
我记得第一次乘校车去上学
I remember the bus ride on the first day of school

160
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,376
非常清楚
very well.

161
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,315
你上不上车？
Are you coming along?

162
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:43,879
妈妈说不要上陌生人的车子
Mama said not to be taking rides from strangers .

163
00:12:43,957 --> 00:12:46,482
这是校车
This is the bus to school.

164
00:12:48,964 --> 00:12:51,762
我是福雷斯…福雷斯甘
I'm Forrest... Forrest Gump.

165
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,630
我是多萝西哈里斯
I'm Dorothy Harris.

166
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:56,137
嗯 现在我们不是陌生人了
Well, now we ain't strangers anymore .

167
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,584
这位子有人了
This seat's taken.

168
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,457
有人了
It's taken.

169
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:24,463
你不准坐这儿
You can't sit here .

170
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,714
你知道 孩子记事实在奇怪
You know, it's funny what a young man recollects,

171
00:13:30,782 --> 00:13:33,114
我不记得我的出生
'cause I don 't remember being born.

172
00:13:33,185 --> 00:13:36,586
我不记得我的第一份圣诞礼物
I don't recall what I got for my first Christmas,

173
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:38,089
我也不记得
and I don't know

174
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:40,591
我第一次去野餐
when I went on my first outdoor picnic,

175
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:42,094
但我却记得
but I do remember

176
00:13:42,162 --> 00:13:46,155
我第一次听到最甜的声音
the first time I heard the sweetest voice

177
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:48,134
在整个世界上
in the wide world.

178
00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:51,139
你愿意的话可以坐这儿
You can sit here if you want.

179
00:13:53,477 --> 00:13:57,345
我一生再没见过如此美丽的人
I had never seen anything so beautiful in my life.

180
00:13:57,415 --> 00:14:00,009
她就象一位天使
She was like an angel.

181
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:03,851
你想坐还是不想坐？
Well, are you going to sit down or aren't you?

182
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:09,986
你的腿怎么啦？
What's wrong with your legs?

183
00:14:10,064 --> 00:14:11,998
没什么 谢谢你
Um, nothing at all, thank you.

184
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:14,864
我的的腿好得很
My legs are just fine and dandy.

185
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:17,871
我和她在并排坐在校车里
I just sat next to her on that bus

186
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,875
去学校途中我们一直在说话
and had a conversation all the way to school.

187
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,378
当时我的背象个问号那么弯
My back's crooked like a question mark.

188
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:26,075
除了妈妈 没有人和我说话
Next to Mama, no one ever talked to me

189
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:28,551
或问我问题
or asked me questions.

190
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,884
你是不是有点傻？
Are you stupid or something?

191
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:34,016
妈妈说 “做傻事的才是傻瓜”
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does."

192
00:14:34,094 --> 00:14:37,086
我叫珍妮
I'm Jenny .

193
00:14:37,164 --> 00:14:39,724
我叫福雷斯…福雷斯甘
I'm Forrest... Forrest Gump.

194
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:42,235
由那天开始 我们经常在一起
From that day on, we was always together.

195
00:14:42,304 --> 00:14:44,864
珍妮和我形影不离
Jenny and me was like peas and carrots.

196
00:14:47,977 --> 00:14:49,877
她教我怎么爬树
She taught me how to climb.

197
00:14:49,947 --> 00:14:52,438
快 福雷斯 你能做到
Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

198
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,178
我教她怎么摇摆
I showed her how to dangle.

199
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:56,777
“一个好小…”
"A good little..."

200
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,289
她帮我学怎么认字
She helped me learn how to read,

201
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:02,452
我教她怎么倒挂
and I showed her how to swing.

202
00:15:03,597 --> 00:15:06,031
有时 我们就那么坐着
Sometimes, we'd just sitout

203
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,398
等星星出来
and wait for the stars.

204
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,938
妈妈会担心我的
Mama's going to worry about me.

205
00:15:11,006 --> 00:15:13,907
再呆一会儿
Just stay a little longer.

206
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:18,072
不知为什么 珍妮从来不爱回家
For some reason, Jenny didn 't never want to go home.

207
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:20,912
好吧 珍妮 我再呆一会儿
O.K.,Jenny, I'll stay .

208
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:25,286
她是我最好的朋友
She was my most special friend.

209
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,257
我唯一的朋友
My only friend.

210
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,933
妈妈总是对我说
Now, my mama always told me

211
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:35,935
每天都会有奇迹
that miracles happen every day

212
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:37,938
有些人并不同意
Some people don't think so,

213
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:39,496
但这是真的
but they do.

214
00:15:41,777 --> 00:15:43,870
嗨 傻瓜！
Hey, dummy!

215
00:15:44,982 --> 00:15:47,416
你是哑巴 还是真的是傻瓜？
Are you dumb, or just plain stupid?

216
00:15:47,484 --> 00:15:49,247
喂 我是福雷斯甘
Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.

217
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,651
快跑 福雷斯
Just run away, Forrest.

218
00:15:51,723 --> 00:15:53,088
跑 福雷斯！
Run, Forrest!

219
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,252
快跑！快！
Run away! Hurry!

220
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:56,885
骑上自行车！
Get the bikes!

221
00:15:56,963 --> 00:15:58,760
我们去捉他！快点！
Let's get him! Come on!

222
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,629
小心点 阿甘！
Look out, Gump!

223
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,567
我们来捉你了！
We're going to get you!

224
00:16:03,638 --> 00:16:05,765
跑 福雷斯 跑！
Run, Forrest, run!

225
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,866
跑 福雷斯！
Run, Forrest!

226
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,803
你给我回来！
Come back here, you!

227
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:27,396
跑 福雷斯！
Run, Forrest!

228
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:29,059
跑！
Run!

229
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,271
你现在大概不会相信我的话…
Now, you wouldn't believe if I told you...

230
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:06,576
但我跑起来像风一样
but I could run like the wind blows.

231
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:10,909
从那天开始
From that day on,

232
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,422
如果我要去哪里
if I was going somewhere,

233
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,857
我就跑着去
I was running.

234
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:52,028
那孩子真是个能跑的傻瓜
That boy sure is a running fool.

235
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:56,933
记不记得我告诉过你
Now, remember how I told you

236
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:59,936
珍妮总是不爱回家？
that Jenny never seemed to want to go home?

237
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:03,372
她家的房子和亚拉巴马州一样老
She lived in a house that was as old as Alabama.

238
00:18:03,443 --> 00:18:06,071
她五岁时她妈妈就去天堂了
Her mama had gone to heaven when she was 5,

239
00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:10,584
她的爸爸好象是个农夫
and her daddy was some kind of a farmer.

240
00:18:10,652 --> 00:18:11,880
珍妮？
Jenny?

241
00:18:11,954 --> 00:18:14,889
他是个非常有爱心的人
He was a very loving man.

242
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:19,122
他经常亲吻抚摸她和她姐妹
He was always kissing and touching her and her sisters.

243
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:22,899
后来有一次
And then this one time,

244
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:25,902
珍妮没有来乘车去学校
Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.

245
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,405
珍妮 你今天怎么不来学校？
Jenny, why didn't you come to school today?

246
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,908
嘘 爸爸正在午睡
Shh. Daddy's taking a nap.

247
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,069
珍妮！
Jenny!

248
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,409
快点！
Come on!

249
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:37,416
珍妮 你往哪儿跑？
Jenny, where'd you run to?

250
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:40,010
你最好马上回来 丫头！
You better get back here, girl!

251
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:44,155
你在哪儿？
Where you at?

252
00:18:47,497 --> 00:18:48,930
珍妮！
Jenny!

253
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,865
珍妮 你在哪儿？
Jenny, where you at?

254
00:18:53,672 --> 00:18:54,639
珍妮！
Jenny!

255
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:56,640
和我一起祈祷 福雷斯
Pray with me, Forrest.

256
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:58,142
和我一起祈祷
Pray with me.

257
00:18:58,211 --> 00:18:59,439
珍妮！
Jenny!

258
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:02,811
亲爱的上帝 把我变成一只会飞的鸟吧
Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far,

259
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:04,817
飞得越远越好
far, far away from here .

260
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:09,823
亲爱的上帝 把我变成一只会飞的鸟吧
Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far.

261
00:19:09,892 --> 00:19:12,827
妈妈常说上帝是神秘的
Mama always said God is mysterious.

262
00:19:12,895 --> 00:19:14,226
珍妮！
Jenny!

263
00:19:14,297 --> 00:19:17,232
那天他没有把珍妮变成一只鸟
He didn 't turn Jenny in to a bird that day.

264
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,063
而是…
Instead,

265
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:21,071
他叫来了警察
he had the police say

266
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:24,575
说珍妮再也不必住在那间房子里了
Jenny didn't have to stay in that house no more.

267
00:19:24,643 --> 00:19:27,077
后来她和她祖母住在一起
She was to live with her grandma,

268
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:29,081
就是克里克大街那里
just over on Creekmore Avenue,

269
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:33,142
我很高兴 因为她那里离我家很近
which made me happy, 'cause she was so close.

270
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:35,615
有时晚上
Some nights,

271
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,624
珍妮会溜出来
Jenny'd sneak out

272
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:40,126
跑到我的房子里
and come on over to my house,

273
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:42,630
因为她说她很害怕
just'cause she said she was scared.

274
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:45,691
害怕什么 我不知道
Scared of what, I don 't know.

275
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:48,431
我猜是怕她祖母的狗
But I think it was her grandma's dog.

276
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:51,441
他是只很凶的狗
He was a mean dog.

277
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,673
总之 珍妮和我是最好的朋友
Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends

278
00:19:54,747 --> 00:19:56,237
一直到上中学
all the way up through high school.

279
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,683
嗨 傻瓜！
Hey, stupid!

280
00:19:58,752 --> 00:20:00,720
住手！
Quit it!

281
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:02,221
跑 福雷斯 跑！
Run, Forrest, run!

282
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:05,784
你没听见吗 傻瓜？

283
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:06,793
跑 福雷斯！
Run, Forrest!

284
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:08,193
快上卡车！
Get in the truck!

285
00:20:08,264 --> 00:20:11,597
快！他要跑了！快追！

286
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,136
跑 福雷斯！跑！
Run, Forrest! Run!

287
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,105

288
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,011
你快跑吧！

289
00:20:36,565 --> 00:20:39,227
哇！ - 快！
- Whoo-hoo! - Go!

290
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,330
跑 福雷斯！
Run, Forrest!

291
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,002
一直以来
Now, it used to be

292
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,015
我到哪儿都跑着去
I ran to get where I was going.

293
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:54,417
我没想过后来会跑遍所有地方
I never thought it would take me anywhere .

294
00:21:23,057 --> 00:21:25,116
那究竟是什么人？
Who in the hell is that?

295
00:21:25,193 --> 00:21:27,991
那人叫福雷斯甘 教练
That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.

296
00:21:28,063 --> 00:21:30,054
当地的傻瓜
Just a local idiot.

297
00:21:30,132 --> 00:21:32,498
你能相信吗？
And can you believe it?

298
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:35,367
我也能上大学了
I got to go to college, too.

299
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,512
福雷斯 快！
Forrest, move it!

300
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:43,513
跑！
Run!

301
00:21:43,582 --> 00:21:44,514
好！
O.K. !

302
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:45,676
跑！
Run!

303
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:48,584
跑 你这狗娘养的傻瓜！跑！
Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run!

304
00:22:01,438 --> 00:22:04,339
跑 狗娘养的 跑！快跑！
Run, son of a bitch, run! Go! Run!

305
00:22:06,544 --> 00:22:09,240
跑！跑！
Run! Run! Go!

306
00:22:20,628 --> 00:22:24,064
他大概是狗娘养的最傻的傻瓜
He must be the stupidest son of a bitch alive ,

307
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:26,100
但他跑得真是快
but he sure is fast.

308
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:30,936
也许只是我这样觉得
Now, maybe it's just me,

309
00:22:31,008 --> 00:22:34,068
但大学生活让我非常迷惑
but college was very confusing times.

310
00:22:35,413 --> 00:22:37,745
联邦军队 执行法庭的判决
Federal troops, enforcing a court order,

311
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,079
今天在亚拉巴马大学取缔种族隔离
integrated the University of Alabama today.

312
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:41,676
允许两名黑人进学校
Two Negroes were admitted,

313
00:22:41,754 --> 00:22:43,688
但乔治华莱士州长随后
but only after Governor George Wallace

314
00:22:43,757 --> 00:22:45,691
发出他的象征性威胁
had carried out his symbolic threat

315
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:48,193
站在教学楼门口
to stand in the school house door.

316
00:22:48,262 --> 00:22:51,026
我对于那个声明…
I take it from that statement...

317
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:53,033
伊尔 出什么事了？
Earl, what's going on?

318
00:22:53,101 --> 00:22:55,535
“熊崽”想进这学校
Coons are trying to get into school.

319
00:22:55,605 --> 00:22:58,540
熊崽？如果浣熊想进我家的后院
Coons? When raccoons tried getting on our back porch,

320
00:22:58,608 --> 00:23:01,042
妈妈会用扫帚赶它们走
Mama just chased them off with a broom.

321
00:23:01,111 --> 00:23:02,976
我不是说浣熊 傻瓜 是黑鬼
Not raccoons, you idiot. Niggers.

322
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:05,982
他们想和我们一起上学校
And they want to go to school with us.

323
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,985
和我们一起？他们？
With us? They do?

324
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,988
在华莱士州长
Shortly after Govern or Wallace

325
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,991
将阻塞校门的威胁付诸实施之后
had carried out his promise to block the door way,

326
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,120
肯尼迪下令国防部使用武力
Kennedy ordered these cretary of defense to use military force.

327
00:23:16,197 --> 00:23:18,529
本台播放的录像 是当时在现场
Here, by video tape, is the encounter

328
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:21,033
国民警卫队指挥官格拉汉将军
by General Graham, commander of the National Guard,

329
00:23:21,103 --> 00:23:22,661
和华莱士州长的冲突
and Governor Wallace.

330
00:23:22,738 --> 00:23:25,502
因为国民警卫队
Because these National Guardsmen

331
00:23:25,575 --> 00:23:29,011
今天是作为亚拉巴马州的联邦士兵
are here today as federal soldiers for Alabama,

332
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,014
他们住在本州境内
and they live within our borders.

333
00:23:31,082 --> 00:23:33,016
他们是我们的兄弟
They are our brothers.

334
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:35,679
我们已经获得胜利
We are winning in this fight,

335
00:23:35,754 --> 00:23:38,689
因为我们唤醒了美国人民
because we are awakening the American people

336
00:23:38,758 --> 00:23:42,694
去面对我们谈论已久的危机
to the dangers that we have spoken about so many times

337
00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:44,697
今天的事清楚地显示…
that is so evident today...

338
00:23:44,765 --> 00:23:48,565
我们的国家正在走向军事独裁
A trend toward military dictatorship in this country.

339
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:53,541
就这样 当天傍晚
And so, at day's end,

340
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:57,067
在图卡卢沙的亚拉巴马大学的隔离被取缔

343
00:24:05,457 --> 00:24:07,186
太太 你的书掉了
Ma'am, you dropped your book.

344
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,852
太太
Ma'am.

345
00:24:08,928 --> 00:24:11,362
华莱士州长说到做到
Govern or Wallace did what he promised.

346
00:24:11,432 --> 00:24:15,027
在图卡卢沙的校园里 他让人们…
By being on the Tuscaloosa campus, he kept the mob...

347
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:16,570
喂 那是阿甘吧？
Say, wasn't that Gump?

348
00:24:16,638 --> 00:24:18,663
不 不会的
Naw, that couldn't be.

349
00:24:18,741 --> 00:24:21,676
绝对是他
It sure as hell was.

350
00:24:25,082 --> 00:24:27,050
几年之后
A few years later,

351
00:24:27,118 --> 00:24:29,552
教学楼门口那位坏脾气的小个子
that angry little man at the school house door

352
00:24:29,621 --> 00:24:32,647
觉得去竞选总统是个好主意
thought it'd be a good idea and ran for president.

353
00:24:35,595 --> 00:24:38,758
但有人觉得不是
But somebody thought that it wasn't.

354
00:24:38,832 --> 00:24:41,426
但他没有死
But he didn't die.

355
00:24:46,608 --> 00:24:48,542
我的车到了
My bus is here .

356
00:24:48,611 --> 00:24:50,545
这是9路车吗？
Is it the number 9?

357
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:52,547
不 这是4路车
No, it's the number 4.

358
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,141
很高兴和你聊天
It was nice talking to you.

359
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,053
我还记得那时候
I remember when that happened,

360
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,558
当华莱士遇刺时
when Wallace got shot.

361
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:02,992
我还在上大学
I was in college.

362
00:25:03,062 --> 00:25:05,496
你上的是女子大学
Did you go to a girls' college

363
00:25:05,566 --> 00:25:07,932
还是男女都有的大学？
or a girls' and boys' together college?

364
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:09,195
男女都有
It was coed.

365
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,000
珍妮上的大学我不能去上
'Cause Jenny went to a college I couldn't go to.

366
00:25:12,073 --> 00:25:14,166
那是所女孩子读的大学
It was a college just for girls.

367
00:25:14,243 --> 00:25:17,679
但我一有机会就去看她
But I'd go and visit her every chance I got.

368
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:26,469
“我不知道我为何爱你”
#I don't know why I love you#

369
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:30,033
“可我就是爱”
# But I do #

370
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:35,874
“我不知道我为何哭泣”
#I don't know why I cry so #

371
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:38,421
“可我就是哭”
# But I do #

372
00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:45,960
“我只知道我知道…”
#I only know I know that... #

373
00:25:48,034 --> 00:25:49,467
很痛
That hurts.

374
00:25:49,536 --> 00:25:54,497
“可我不知道我为何爱你”
# But I don't know why I love you#

375
00:25:54,575 --> 00:25:57,567
“可我就是爱”
# But I do #

376
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:02,107
福雷斯！
Forrest!

377
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,449
福雷斯！
Forrest!

378
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,455
福雷斯 住手！
Forrest, stop it!

379
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,956
住手！
Stop it!

380
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:09,459
你干什么？
What are you doing?

381
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:10,960
他在伤害你
He was hurting you.

382
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:12,462
不 他没有！
No, he wasn't!

383
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,465
往那边走！
Get over there !

384
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,966
比利 对不起
Billy, I'm sorry.

385
00:26:16,036 --> 00:26:17,469
请离我远一点
Just keep away from me.

386
00:26:17,537 --> 00:26:19,471
不要这样…不要走
Don't be such... Don't go.

387
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:21,473
比利 等一下
Billy, wait a second.

388
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:23,908
他不懂事
He doesn't know any better.

389
00:26:25,547 --> 00:26:28,573
福雷斯 你为什么那样做？
Forrest, why'd you do that?

390
00:26:31,054 --> 00:26:34,490
我给你带了巧克力来
I brought you some chocolate.

391
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:35,786
对不起
I'm sorry.

392
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,997
现在我要回我的学校了
I'll go back to my college now .

393
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:42,329
福雷斯…
Forrest...

394
00:26:45,572 --> 00:26:47,096
瞧你
Look at you.

395
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:50,509
来吧
Come on.

396
00:26:50,578 --> 00:26:51,670
来吧
Come on.

397
00:26:58,855 --> 00:27:00,288
这是你自己的房间吗？
Is this your own room?

398
00:27:00,357 --> 00:27:01,289
嘘！
Shh!

399
00:27:04,962 --> 00:27:07,139
你有过梦想吗 福雷斯…
Do you ever dream, Forrest...

400
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:10,642
梦想你将来要成为什么人？
about who you're going to be?

401
00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:13,312
我将来要成为什么人？
Who I'm going to be?

402
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,312
对
Yeah.

403
00:27:14,381 --> 00:27:16,315
我将来不能做我自己了吗？
Aren't I going to be me?

404
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,646
你永远都会是你
You'll always be you,

405
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,653
但会是另一种人
just another kind of you.

406
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:21,815
你明白吗？
You know?

407
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:23,825
我想成名
I want to be famous.

408
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:28,657
我想当个琼贝兹那样的歌手
I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.

409
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,667
我只想…
I just want to be...

410
00:27:30,735 --> 00:27:32,168
站在空旷的舞台上
on an empty stage

411
00:27:32,237 --> 00:27:34,831
伴着我的吉它 我的歌声
with my guitar, my voice.

412
00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:37,501
只有我自己
Just me.

413
00:27:39,245 --> 00:27:42,681
我想自己去接触大众
And I want to reach people on a personal level.

414
00:27:45,087 --> 00:27:47,521
我想能够谈一些事
I want to be able to say things,

415
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:49,022
只是两个人之间
just one to one.

416
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:58,458
你有和女孩子一起过吗 福雷斯？
Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?

417
00:28:00,371 --> 00:28:01,804
我和她们坐一起
I sit next to them

418
00:28:01,874 --> 00:28:04,365
在家政课的课堂上
in my home economics class all the time.

419
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:34,574
啊 对不起
Oh, I'm sorry.

420
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:35,672
没关系
It's O.K.

421
00:28:35,749 --> 00:28:36,681
对不起
Sorry.

422
00:28:43,926 --> 00:28:45,416
没关系
It's all right.

423
00:28:48,665 --> 00:28:50,098
没关系
It's O.K.

424
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,600
啊 我头晕
Oh, I'm dizzy .

425

427
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,695
我想我弄脏了你室友的浴袍
I think I ruined your roommate's bathrobe.

428
00:29:17,765 --> 00:29:20,199
我无所谓 反正我不喜欢她
I don't care . I don't like her anyway .

429
00:29:20,268 --> 00:29:22,862

大学生活过得真快

435
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,906
因为我美式足球打得太多

452
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:19,859

我听着他好象说他想撒尿

不久之后,不知什么原因

这次他是在一个酒店的厨房里

467
00:31:08,462 --> 00:31:10,555
做兄弟可真不容易啊

468
00:31:12,133 --> 00:31:13,464

入伍第一天

你愿意的话可以坐下

492

我不知我会遇到谁

493
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,513
或他们会问我什么

494
00:32:17,581 --> 00:32:20,345
你有没有乘过真正的捕虾船？

人们都管我叫布巴

505
00:32:46,117 --> 00:32:48,551
好象个乡下佬的名字

506
00:32:48,619 --> 00:32:49,881
很难以置信吧？

你到部队来干什么？
What's your sole purpose in this army?

522

干你叫我干的事 教官！

不知什么原因 我很适合当兵
Now for some reason, I fit in the army

529
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:50,495
就象一对插销那么适合
Like one of them round pegs.

530
00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:51,825
真实一点都不苦
It's not really hard.

531
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:53,832
你只需把你的床铺好

532
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,333
记着要站得笔直

533

不管回答什么问题

534
00:33:57,071 --> 00:33:59,005
都说“是 教官”

535
00:33:59,073 --> 00:34:00,506

是 教官！
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

537
00:34:02,911 --> 00:34:06,347
你只需要沿着海底拖你的网
What you do is drag your nets along the bottom.

538
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:07,678
在一个好天气
On a good day,

539
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:10,686
你一次就能捕到上百磅的虾

540
00:34:10,755 --> 00:34:12,017
如果一切顺利

541
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:13,852
两个人捕10个小时的虾

542
00:34:13,925 --> 00:34:16,018
减去你用掉的油费

543
00:34:16,094 --> 00:34:18,187
完成了 教官！

544
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,697
阿甘！
Gump!

545
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:24,203
为什么你这么快就把枪装好了？
Why did you put that weapon together so quickly?

546
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:26,205
你叫我这么做的 教官
You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

547
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:27,866
耶稣基督啊
Jesus H. Christ.

548
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:29,876
这是新的连队纪录
This is a new company record .

549
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:31,378
如果不是因为
If it wasn't a waste

550
00:34:31,447 --> 00:34:32,880
我们这儿兵源不足
of a fine enlisted man,

551
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:35,382
我会推荐你上军官预备学校 列兵阿甘
I'd recommend you for O.C.S., Private Gump.

552
00:34:35,452 --> 00:34:37,716
有朝一日你会当上将军！
You're going to be a general someday!

553
00:34:37,788 --> 00:34:39,722
现在把你的枪拆开重装一遍！
Now disassemble your weapon and continue!

554
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:43,727
总之 就象我说过的
Anyway, like I was saying,

555
00:34:43,796 --> 00:34:46,060
虾是海里最好的东西
shrimp is the fruit of the sea.

556
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:49,396
你可以烧它、煮它、烤它

557

烘它、炒它

你要保持双脚干燥
Try and keep your feet dry.

706
00:42:58,336 --> 00:43:00,770
我们爬山的时候 要换袜子
When we're out humpin', change your socks

707
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:02,033
否则停下来的时候
whenever we stop.

708
00:43:02,107 --> 00:43:04,371
湄公河会把你的脚泡烂
The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet

709
00:43:04,442 --> 00:43:05,875
整个脚会掉下来
right off his legs.

710
00:43:05,944 --> 00:43:07,377
西斯中士 见鬼
Sergeant Sims. God damn it,

711
00:43:07,445 --> 00:43:09,879
我叫你去领的绳子呢？
where's that sling rope I said to order?

712
00:43:09,948 --> 00:43:11,381
我写到申请单上了
I put in the requisitions.

713
00:43:11,449 --> 00:43:13,713
嗯 你叫那帮狗娘养的…
Well, you call those sons of bitches...

714
00:43:13,785 --> 00:43:15,878
丹中尉很了解他的下属
Lieutenant Dan sure knew his stuff.

715
00:43:15,954 --> 00:43:18,889
能做他的下属我觉得很幸运
I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.

716
00:43:18,957 --> 00:43:22,620
他来自一个军人世家
He was from a long, great military tradition.

717
00:43:22,694 --> 00:43:25,219
他家族的人曾经分别参加…
Somebody in his family had fought

718
00:43:25,296 --> 00:43:26,763
并牺牲…
and died

719
00:43:26,831 --> 00:43:28,423
在…
in every...

720
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,626
每一场…
single...

721
00:43:29,701 --> 00:43:31,794
美国的战争里
American war.

722
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,804
见鬼 抓紧时间
God damn it, kick some ass.

723
00:43:33,872 --> 00:43:35,134
快去做！
Get on it!

724
00:43:35,206 --> 00:43:36,639
我想你可以说
I guess you could say

725
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:39,142
他很有荣誉感
he had a lot to live up to.

726
00:43:40,211 --> 00:43:42,145
那么你们几个是堪萨斯人 是吗？
So, you boys from Arkansas, huh?

727
00:43:42,213 --> 00:43:43,305
嗯
Well,

728
00:43:43,381 --> 00:43:45,144
我去过那里
I been through there.

729
00:43:45,216 --> 00:43:47,980
小石城是个好地方
Little Rock's a fine town.

730
00:43:48,053 --> 00:43:49,816
现在放下装备
Now, shake down your gear.

731
00:43:49,888 --> 00:43:51,150
去找排军需官
See the platoon sergeant.

732
00:43:51,222 --> 00:43:53,986
领你要用的东西
Draw what you need for the field.

733
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:55,492
如果你们几个饿了
If you boys are hungry,

734
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,324
我们这儿正好在烧牛排
we got steaks burning right over here .

735
00:43:58,396 --> 00:44:01,160
我们排有两条守则…
Two standing orders in this platoon...

736
00:44:01,232 --> 00:44:03,757
一：保护好你的脚
1... take care of your feet,

737
00:44:03,835 --> 00:44:07,430
二：别做任何傻事
2... try not to do anything stupid,

738
00:44:07,505 --> 00:44:09,097
比如让你自己被打死
Like getting yourself killed.

739
00:44:15,346 --> 00:44:17,871
我希望我不会令他失望
I sure hope I don't let him down.

740
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,995
我到了这个国家的很多地方
I got to see a lot of the country side.

741
00:44:32,063 --> 00:44:34,463
我们走了很长的路
We would take these real long walks.

742
00:44:36,534 --> 00:44:38,468
“总会有条路”
# There must be some kind of way #

743
00:44:38,536 --> 00:44:40,629
“从这里出发”
# Out of here #

744
00:44:40,705 --> 00:44:42,798
“小丑告诉贼”
# Said the joker to the thief #

745
00:44:42,874 --> 00:44:44,307
我们总是在找
And we were always lookin'

746
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:46,309
一个叫“越共”的家伙
for this guy named Charlie.

747
00:44:46,377 --> 00:44:47,969
“一切都令人迷惑”
# There's too much confusion #

748
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,144
“我什么都不相信”
# I can't get no relief #

749
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:55,811
停下！
Hold it up!

750
00:44:55,887 --> 00:44:57,320
停下 兄弟们！
Hold up, boys!

751
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:01,916
也不总是很有趣
It wasn't always fun.

752
00:45:01,993 --> 00:45:05,258
丹中尉总是有些奇怪的感觉
Lieutenant Dan was always getting these funny feelings

753
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:08,424
对于路上的风吹草动
about a rock or a trail or the road,

754
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,435
他会叫我们蹲下 安静
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up.

755
00:45:11,503 --> 00:45:12,595
蹲下！
Get down!

756
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:13,762
安静！
Shut up!

757
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:16,101
我们都照做
So we did.

758
00:45:32,624 --> 00:45:35,889
我对什么都不太明白
Now I don't know much about anything,

759
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,895
但我想美国最好的年青人
but I think some of America's best young men

760
00:45:38,963 --> 00:45:40,225
都参加了这场战争
served in this war.

761
00:45:40,298 --> 00:45:42,562
那是非尼克斯来的达拉斯
There was Dallas from Phoenix.

762
00:45:43,968 --> 00:45:46,732
克利夫兰…他来自底特律
Cleveland... he was from Detroit.

763
00:45:46,804 --> 00:45:48,032
嘿 泰克斯
Hey, Tex.

764
00:45:48,106 --> 00:45:49,596
嘿 泰克斯
Hey, Tex.

765
00:45:49,674 --> 00:45:51,266
究竟出什么事了？
What the hell's going on?

766
00:45:51,342 --> 00:45:53,537
泰克斯是…
And Tex was...

767
00:45:53,611 --> 00:45:56,205
嗯 我不记得泰克斯是哪里人了
Well, I don't remember where Tex come from...

768
00:45:56,281 --> 00:45:57,805
啊 没事了
Ah, nothing.

769
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:03,744
第四排 站起来
Fourth platoon, on your feet.

770
00:46:03,821 --> 00:46:06,722
你们10分钟内赶到河边
Y'all got 10 clicks to go to that river.

771
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:08,383
出发
Move out.

772
00:46:08,459 --> 00:46:10,893
一二一！
1, 2! Hup!

773
00:46:12,297 --> 00:46:13,730
齐步走！
Step it up!

774
00:46:13,798 --> 00:46:15,129
那边好象不错
Look alive out there .

775
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,633
在越南最好的一点
The good thing about Vietnam

776
00:46:16,701 --> 00:46:18,965
就是总有地方可去
is there was always someplace to go.

777
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:20,299
小心手雷！
Fire in the hole!

778
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:26,469
阿甘 搜一下那个洞
Gump, check out that hole.

779
00:46:26,544 --> 00:46:29,479
也总有事情可做
And there was always something to do.

780
00:46:29,547 --> 00:46:30,639
准备好！
Mount'em up!

781
00:46:30,715 --> 00:46:32,512
散开！掩护他！
Spread out! Cover his back!

782
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:40,183
有一天开始下雨了
One day it started raining,

783
00:46:40,258 --> 00:46:43,591
然后一直不停的下了四个月
and it didn't quit for four months.

784
00:46:43,661 --> 00:46:47,097
我们经历了各种各样的雨…
We've been through every kind of rain there is...

785
00:46:47,165 --> 00:46:49,793
象小针样的雨
little bitty stinging rain

786
00:46:50,315 --> 00:46:53,524
还有倾盆大雨
and big old fat rain,

787
00:46:53,585 --> 00:46:56,027
从侧面下的雨
rain that flew in side ways,

788
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:57,806
有时甚至还有
and sometimes rain even seemed

789
00:46:57,883 --> 00:47:01,215
从下往上的雨
to come straight up from underneath.

790
00:47:01,287 --> 00:47:04,813
连晚上也下雨
Shoot, it even rained at night.

791
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:06,652
嘿 福雷斯
Hey, Forrest.

792
00:47:06,727 --> 00:47:07,815
嘿 布巴
Hey, Bubba.

793
00:47:07,897 --> 00:47:10,159
我的背靠着你的背
I'm going to lean up against you.

794
00:47:10,233 --> 00:47:11,663
你的背靠着你的背
You lean up against me.

795
00:47:11,735 --> 00:47:13,997
这样我们睡着的时候
This way we don't have to sleep

796
00:47:14,073 --> 00:47:16,003
头就不会钻进泥里
with our heads in the mud.

797
00:47:16,075 --> 00:47:18,667
你知道为何我们是好伙伴 福雷斯？
You know why we're a good partnership, Forrest?

798
00:47:18,747 --> 00:47:22,010
因为我们互相照顾
'Cause we be watching out for one another,

799
00:47:22,085 --> 00:47:23,845
就象兄弟一样
like brothers and stuff.

800
00:47:25,757 --> 00:47:27,347
嘿 福雷斯
Hey, Forrest,

801
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,517
我在考虑一件事
something I been thinking about.

802
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,528
我有个很重要的问题要问你
I got a very important question to ask you.

803
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:36,199
你想不想
How would you like to go

804
00:47:36,272 --> 00:47:38,202
和我一起去捕虾？
into the shrimping business with me?

805
00:47:39,778 --> 00:47:41,038
好的
O.K.

806
00:47:41,113 --> 00:47:42,873
兄弟 你听我说
Man, I tell you what.

807
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:45,212
我全计划好了
I got it all figured out, too.

808
00:47:45,287 --> 00:47:46,717
我们捕到的虾多少磅
So many pounds of shrimp

809
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:48,219
拿来付买船的贷款
will pay off the boat.

810
00:47:48,291 --> 00:47:49,721
多少磅拿来付油费
So many pounds for gas.

811
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:51,722
我们住在船上就行
We'll live right on the boat.

812
00:47:51,796 --> 00:47:54,058
这样就不用付房租
We ain't got to pay no rent.

813
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:56,063
我们合伙来干
We can just work it together,

814
00:47:56,136 --> 00:47:58,066
全部都对半分
split everything right down the middle.

815
00:47:58,139 --> 00:48:00,229
兄弟 告诉你 五五分成
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

816
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:03,333
还有 福雷斯 虾可以随便吃
Hey, Forrest, all the shrimp you can eat.

817
00:48:04,914 --> 00:48:07,506
真是个好主意
That's a fine idea.

818
00:48:07,586 --> 00:48:10,347
布巴的主意真得很好
Bubba did have a fine idea.

819
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:15,600
我甚至写信给珍妮
I even wrote Jenny

820
00:48:16,235 --> 00:48:18,165
告诉她这件事情
and told her all about it.

821
00:48:18,238 --> 00:48:19,828
我给她寄信…
I sent her letters...

822
00:48:19,908 --> 00:48:21,998
差不多每天都寄
Not every day, but almost.

823
00:48:22,077 --> 00:48:24,339
告诉她我在做的事
I told her what I was doing

824
00:48:24,414 --> 00:48:26,847
也问她在做些什么
and asked her what she was doing

825
00:48:26,918 --> 00:48:30,110
告诉她我经常想念她
and told her how I thought about her always.

826
00:48:31,482 --> 00:48:33,412
和我多么希望
And how I was looking forward

827
00:48:33,485 --> 00:48:35,415
能收到她一封回信
to getting a letter from her

828
00:48:35,488 --> 00:48:38,249
只要她有时间
just as soon as she had the time.

829
00:48:38,327 --> 00:48:41,259
我总是告诉她我很平安
I'd always let her know that I was O. K.

830
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:48,760
然后我的落款总是“爱你的福雷斯甘”
Then I'd sign each letter "Love, Forrest Gump. "

831
00:48:58,688 --> 00:49:01,449
“有事情正在发生”
# There's somethin' happenin' here #

832
00:49:02,795 --> 00:49:06,389
那一天 我们象平常一样走着
This one day, we was out walking like always,

833
00:49:06,466 --> 00:49:10,230
然后 忽然之间
and then, just like that,

834
00:49:10,306 --> 00:49:12,236
就象有人关掉天上的水龙头
somebody turned off the rain,

835
00:49:12,309 --> 00:49:13,899
太阳出来了
and the sun come out.

836
00:49:13,978 --> 00:49:16,739
“我必须小心”
# I got to beware #

837
00:49:16,816 --> 00:49:18,906
有埋伏！
Ambush!

838
00:49:18,985 --> 00:49:20,915
快找掩护！
Take cover!

839
00:49:29,503 --> 00:49:32,129
快把它拿过来 见鬼
Get that pig up here, god damn it!

840
00:49:32,265 --> 00:49:34,390
福雷斯 你没事吧？
Forrest! You okay?

841
00:49:37,005 --> 00:49:39,903
强手 强手！
Strong-arm, Strong-arm!

842
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,771
嘿！有个人倒下了！
Hey! We got a man down!

843
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:46,304
强手 我们是第雷利六号！完毕！
Strong-arm, this is Leg Lima 6! Over!

844
00:49:46,385 --> 00:49:48,818

Roger, Strong-arm! Be advised we have incoming

845
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:51,289
在蓝点树林
from the tree line at point blue

846
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,690
从两个方向！有冲锋枪和火箭筒！
plus two! A.K.s and rockets!

847
00:49:53,764 --> 00:49:55,024
我们损失惨重！
We're getting it hard!

848
00:49:55,098 --> 00:49:56,654
哑火！哑火！
Misfire! Misfire!

849
00:49:57,735 --> 00:49:59,530
见鬼！
God damn it!

850
00:50:01,108 --> 00:50:05,041
把那玩意扔掉撤退到树林！
Get that pig unfucked and on the treeline!

851
00:50:06,882 --> 00:50:09,474
他们压住我们了
They got us, and it hurt.

852
00:50:09,554 --> 00:50:13,045
我们准备撤退
We're going to move back to the blue line.

853
00:50:13,126 --> 00:50:16,024
撤退！撤退！
Pull back! Pull back!

854
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,084
福雷斯！跑 福雷斯！
Forrest! Run, Forrest!

855
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:19,892
撤退！
Pull back!

856
00:50:19,969 --> 00:50:22,162
跑！跑 兄弟！
Run! Run, man!

857
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,328
跑！
Run!

858
00:50:23,408 --> 00:50:24,668
撤退 阿甘！
Pull back, Gump!

859
00:50:26,245 --> 00:50:29,405
跑 见鬼！跑！
Run, God damn it! Run!

860
00:50:55,355 --> 00:50:59,380
我一直跑 就象珍妮要我做的
I ran and ran just like Jenny told me to.

861
00:51:02,132 --> 00:51:04,325
我跑得这么快这么远
I ran so far so fast

862
00:51:04,401 --> 00:51:06,834
很快就只剩下我一个人
that pretty soon I was all by myself,

863
00:51:06,905 --> 00:51:08,495
这下糟糕了
which was a bad thing.

864
00:51:08,575 --> 00:51:09,663
布巴
Bubba.

865
00:51:12,246 --> 00:51:14,336
布巴是我最好的朋友
Bubba was my best good friend.

866
00:51:14,417 --> 00:51:16,850
我要保证他没事
I had to make sure he was O.K.

867
00:51:25,935 --> 00:51:28,368
你在哪儿？
Where the hell are you?

868
00:51:28,437 --> 00:51:30,527
布巴！
Bubba!

869
00:51:30,608 --> 00:51:33,540
我回去找布巴途中
And on my way back to find Bubba,

870
00:51:33,613 --> 00:51:36,374
发现有个人躺在地上
well, there was this boy laying on the ground.

871
00:51:36,451 --> 00:51:37,435
泰克斯
Tex.

872
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:40,977
好了
O.K.

873
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,489
我不能让他单独躺在那里
I couldn't let him lay there all alone,

874
00:51:43,561 --> 00:51:44,991
他非常害怕
scared the way he was,

875
00:51:45,063 --> 00:51:46,823
所以我扶起他
so I grabbed him up

876
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:48,625
背他逃出那里
and run him out of there.

877
00:52:03,856 --> 00:52:06,584
每次我回去找布巴
Every time I went back looking for Bubba,

878
00:52:06,661 --> 00:52:08,091
总有人在喊：
somebody else was saying,

879
00:52:08,162 --> 00:52:11,094
“救命 福雷斯 救命！”
"Help me, Forrest, help me! "

880
00:52:17,678 --> 00:52:19,837
好了 好了
O.K. Here. Here .

881
00:52:22,152 --> 00:52:25,118
不要怕 兄弟 躺下 你会没事的
No sweat, man. Lay back. You'll be O.K.

882
00:52:27,526 --> 00:52:31,986
我开始担心我可能永远找不到布巴
I started to get scared that I might never find Bubba.

883
00:52:32,067 --> 00:52:33,497
我知道我的处境
I know my position

884
00:52:33,568 --> 00:52:35,465
越来越危险！
is danger close!

885
00:52:35,538 --> 00:52:37,971
这一带到处都是“越共”
We got Charlie all over this area.

886
00:52:38,043 --> 00:52:40,975
我这儿需要快速的支援 完毕
I got to have those fast movers in here now. Over.

887
00:52:41,047 --> 00:52:43,480
丹中尉 科曼死了！
Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

888
00:52:43,551 --> 00:52:44,981
我知道他死了！
I know he's dead!

889
00:52:45,053 --> 00:52:47,985
我他妈的整个排全完了！
My whole goddamn platoon is wiped out!

890
00:52:48,058 --> 00:52:49,488
该死的！
God damn it!

891
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:51,489
你干什么？
What are you doing?

892
00:52:51,562 --> 00:52:52,992
你把我放下！
You leave me here!

893
00:52:53,064 --> 00:52:54,994
走开 把我留在这里！
Get away . Just leave me here!

894
00:52:55,067 --> 00:52:56,497
走开！
Get out!

895
00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:00,503
啊！我说把我留在这儿 该死的！
Aah! God, I said leave me here, God damn it!

896
00:53:00,575 --> 00:53:02,939
雷利 我是强手
Leg Lima, this is Strong-arm.

897
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,979
我们马上提供快速支援 完毕
Be advised your fast movers are in bound. Over.

898
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:09,450
突然好象有什么东西跳起来咬我
Then it felt like something just jumped up and bit me.

899
00:53:09,522 --> 00:53:12,283
啊！什么东西在咬我！
Aah! Something bit me!

900
00:53:19,203 --> 00:53:21,133
你这狗娘养的！
You son of a bitch!

901
00:53:22,609 --> 00:53:25,633
我不能离开我的排
I can't leave the platoon.

902
00:53:25,712 --> 00:53:27,644
我叫你把我留在那里 阿甘
I told you to leave me there, Gump.

903
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,682
丢下我 你自己逃吧！
Forget about me. Get your self out!

904
00:53:30,755 --> 00:53:32,984
你听到我的话没有？
Did you hear what I said?

905
00:53:33,057 --> 00:53:35,490
阿甘 见鬼 放下我
Gump, damn it, put me down.

906
00:53:35,561 --> 00:53:38,084
你自己逃吧
Get your ass out of here.

907
00:53:40,069 --> 00:53:43,194
我没叫你救我出去 去你妈的！
I didn't ask you to pull me out of there, God damn you!

908
00:53:43,274 --> 00:53:45,000
你又要去哪里？
Where the hell do you think you're going?

909
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,708
去找布巴
To get Bubba.

910
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,713
我已经呼叫空袭了
I got an air strike in bound right now.

911
00:53:49,784 --> 00:53:52,274
他们会把那里炸平
They're going to nape the whole area.

912
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:53,500
留在这里！这是命令
Stay here! That's an order.

913
00:53:53,502 --> 00:53:56,321
我要找到布巴！
I gotta find Bubba!

914
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:13,240
福雷斯
Forrest.

915
00:54:20,562 --> 00:54:21,891
布巴
Bubba.

916
00:54:21,965 --> 00:54:23,793
我没事 福雷斯
I'm O.K., Forrest.

917
00:54:23,867 --> 00:54:25,389
我没事
I'm O.K.

918
00:54:33,815 --> 00:54:35,836
啊 布巴 不
O-Oh, Bubba, no.

919
00:54:35,919 --> 00:54:37,714
我没事的
I'll be all right.

920
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,188
行了
Come on.

921
00:54:47,269 --> 00:54:48,995
行了 行了
Come on. Come on.

922
00:54:52,977 --> 00:54:55,671
我没事 福雷斯
Ugh. I'm O.K., Forrest.

923
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,550
我没事 我很好
I'm O.K. I'm fine.

924
00:55:37,077 --> 00:55:40,101
炸平那里
Top smoke. Get it up there .

925
00:55:40,182 --> 00:55:43,046
如果我知道这将是
If I'd have known this was going to be

926
00:55:43,118 --> 00:55:46,050
我和布巴的最后一次谈话
the last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,

927
00:55:46,123 --> 00:55:49,055
我会想些更好的话来说
I'd of thought of something better to say.

928
00:55:49,129 --> 00:55:50,182
嘿 布巴
Hey, Bubba.

929
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,523
嘿 福雷斯
Hey, Forrest.

930
00:55:53,968 --> 00:55:55,398
福雷斯…
Forrest...

931
00:55:55,472 --> 00:55:58,563
出什么事了？
Why did this happen?

932
00:55:58,643 --> 00:56:01,575
你中弹了
You got shot.

933
00:56:01,645 --> 00:56:06,014
布巴说了一句我永远不会忘记的话
Then Bubba said something I won't ever forget.

934
00:56:06,086 --> 00:56:09,646
我想回家
I want to go home.

935
00:56:09,726 --> 00:56:12,521
布巴是我最好的好朋友
Bubba was my best good friend.

936
00:56:12,596 --> 00:56:14,526
我还知道
And even I know

937
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:18,034
好朋友不是那么容易找到的
that ain't something you can find just around the corner.

938
00:56:18,105 --> 00:56:21,540
布巴想当一个捕虾船的船长
Bubba was going to be a shrimping boat captain,

939
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:25,910
但是 他却死在越南的一条河边
but instead, he died right there by that river in Vietnam.

940
00:56:31,492 --> 00:56:33,822
我要说的就是这些了
That's all I have to say about that.

941
00:56:36,033 --> 00:56:38,226
那是粒子弹 是吗？
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

942
00:56:40,139 --> 00:56:41,569
子弹？
A bullet?

943
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,368
跳起来咬你的那个东西
That jumped up and bit you.

944
00:56:45,513 --> 00:56:47,375
啊 对 先生
Oh. Yes, sir.

945
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:50,075
正好咬在我屁股上
Bit me directly in the but-tocks .

946
00:56:50,152 --> 00:56:54,589
他们说这样的伤口价值百万 但…
They said it was a million dollar wound, but...

947
00:56:54,659 --> 00:56:56,589
那些钱大概是被军队留着了
the army must keep that money ,

948
00:56:56,662 --> 00:57:00,595
因为那一百万我至今连半毛钱也没看见
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel of that million dollars .

949
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:04,424
屁股受伤的唯一好处
The only good thing about being wounded in the but-tocks

950
00:57:04,562 --> 00:57:06,322
是冰淇淋
is the ice cream.

951
00:57:06,397 --> 00:57:09,295
我能吃多少冰淇淋他们就给我多少
They gave me all the ice cream I could eat.

952
00:57:09,369 --> 00:57:10,799
你猜怎么着？
And guess what?

953
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:14,770
我的一位好朋友就在隔壁床上
A good friend of mine was in the bed right next door.

954
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,138
丹中尉 我给你拿冰淇淋来了
Lieutenant Dan, I got you some ice cream.

955
00:57:21,019 --> 00:57:23,747
丹中尉 冰淇淋！
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream!

956
00:57:34,607 --> 00:57:37,368
你该洗澡了 中尉
It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

957
00:57:45,622 --> 00:57:47,018
哈珀！
Harper!

958
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:52,060
库珀
Cooper.

959
00:57:52,131 --> 00:57:53,059
拉森
Larson.

960
00:57:55,136 --> 00:57:56,396
韦斯特
Webster.

961
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,070
阿甘
Gump.

962
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,572
阿甘！
Gump!

963
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:02,270
我是福雷斯甘
I'm Forrest Gump.

964
00:58:04,583 --> 00:58:05,979
凯利
Kyle.

965
00:58:07,588 --> 00:58:08,917
尼科斯
Nichols.

966
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:13,024
麦克米尔
McMill.

967
00:58:13,097 --> 00:58:14,081
约翰逊
Johnson.

968
00:58:25,164 --> 00:58:28,130
惊喜 惊喜 惊喜！
Surprise, surprise, surprise!

969
00:58:30,939 --> 00:58:34,374
阿甘 你怎么能看这种狗屎节目？
Gump, how can you watch that stupid shit?

970
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:35,874
把它关掉
Turn it off.

971
00:58:35,946 --> 00:58:38,379
你正在收看美军台
You are tuned to the American forces

972
00:58:38,451 --> 00:58:39,881
越南电视网
Vietnam network.

973
00:58:39,953 --> 00:58:41,509
这是西贡台6频道
This is channel 6, Saigon.

974
00:58:43,957 --> 00:58:45,615
接得好 阿甘
Good catch, Gump.

975
00:58:47,463 --> 00:58:49,360
你知道怎么打吗？
You know how to play this?

976
00:58:50,969 --> 00:58:53,436
来 我教你
Come on. Let me show you.

977
00:58:54,974 --> 00:58:57,407
打乒乓球的关键就是
Now, the secret to this game is

978
00:58:57,477 --> 00:58:59,407
无论发生什么事
no matter what happens,

979
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,913
永远不要…
never, ever...

980
00:59:01,985 --> 00:59:04,075
把目光离开球
take your eye off the ball.

981
00:59:06,993 --> 00:59:08,253
好吧
All right.

982
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,930
不知为什么
For some reason,

983
00:59:13,002 --> 00:59:15,435
我天生是打乒乓的料
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.

984
00:59:15,505 --> 00:59:16,663
看见了？
See?

985
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,933
连傻瓜也会打
Any idiot can play .

986
00:59:19,011 --> 00:59:22,446
于是我开始经常打球
So I started playing it all the time.

987
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,142
我打乒乓球
I played Ping-Pong

988
00:59:24,218 --> 00:59:27,812
甚至没人陪着也能打
even when I didn't have anyone to play Ping-Pong with.

989
00:59:36,169 --> 00:59:37,599
医院里的人
The hospital's people

990
00:59:37,673 --> 00:59:41,606
说我就象下了水的鸭子…
said it made me look like a duck in water...

991
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:43,108

992
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,409
但连丹中尉也来看我打球

我打了这么多的乒乓球

连睡觉时也在打

我们都有自己的命运

没什么事是完全偶然的 它总有缘故
Nothing just happens. It's all part of a plan!

999
01:00:11,615 --> 01:00:14,604
我应该和我的士兵一起死在那儿
I should have died out there with my men,

1000
01:00:14,685 --> 01:00:18,676
但现在…我只是个他妈的残废人

1001
01:00:18,757 --> 01:00:20,449

你知不知道

没有腿是什么感觉？

1008
01:00:39,489 --> 01:00:41,351
你害了我！

1009

我本该死在战场上

1011

那才是我的命运
That was my destiny,

1013
01:00:48,602 --> 01:00:51,568
而你…使我得不到它！

1014
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:02,483
你听明白我的话了吗 阿甘？
You understand what I'm saying, Gump?

1015
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,051
本来不应该是这样…
This wasn't supposed to happen...

1016
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:09,926
我不应该这样
Not to me.

1017
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:12,992
我有自己的命运

01:08:43,432 --> 01:08:45,066
黑人士兵总被送往前线
where black soldiers are sent to the front line

1132
01:08:45,123 --> 01:08:46,846
为一个仇恨他们的国家送死
to die for a country that hates them.

1133
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:49,953
我们反对任何派黑人士兵去打仗的战争
We are against any war where black soldiers go to fight

1134
01:08:50,023 --> 01:08:51,523
这样会毁掉他们自己的社区
and come to be brutalized and killed in their own communities.

1135
01:08:51,723 --> 01:08:57,737
我们反对种族主义和帝国主义行为
We are against these racist and imperial acts...

1136
01:09:00,965 --> 01:09:03,970
“我给她一支枪”
# And I gave her the gun #

1137
01:09:04,068 --> 01:09:06,089
“我给她一枪”
# I shot her #

1138
01:09:08,733 --> 01:09:10,516
福雷斯
Forrest!

1139
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:11,506
停手！
Stop it!

1140
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:12,680
停手！
Stop it!

1141
01:09:13,493 --> 01:09:14,558
福雷斯！
Forrest!

1142
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:17,021
停手！停手！
Stop it! Stop it!

1143
01:09:25,837 --> 01:09:28,269
我不该带你来这里
I shouldn't have brought you here .

1144
01:09:28,341 --> 01:09:33,038
我早该知道大家会争吵！
I should have known it was going to be some bullshit hassle!

1145
01:09:33,113 --> 01:09:35,670
他不该打你 珍妮
He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

1146
01:09:40,857 --> 01:09:42,684
走吧 福雷斯
Come on, Forrest.

1147
01:09:47,799 --> 01:09:52,514
对不起我在你们黑豹党聚会上打架
Sorry I had a fight in the middle of your Black Panther party .

1148
01:09:54,342 --> 01:09:57,240
他不是故意这么做的
He doesn't mean it when he does things like this.

1149
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:59,776
我永远也不会伤害你 珍妮
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

1150
01:10:01,719 --> 01:10:03,650
我知道你不会,福雷斯
I know you wouldn't, Forrest.

1151
01:10:05,724 --> 01:10:08,417
我想成为你的男友
I wanted to be your boy friend.

1152
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:21,069
这件制服不错 福雷斯
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

1153
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:24,780
你穿起来很帅
You look handsome in it.

1154
01:10:24,855 --> 01:10:26,582
真的
You do.

1155
01:10:29,862 --> 01:10:31,292
你知道吗?
You know what?

1156
01:10:31,362 --> 01:10:32,451
什么?
What?

1157
01:10:34,868 --> 01:10:39,201
很开心我们俩能一起到首都来
I'm glad we were here together in our nation's capital.

1158
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,300
我也是 福雷斯
Me, too, Forrest.

1159
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:45,837
我们整晚到处逛 我和珍妮
We walked around all night, Jenny and me,

1160
01:10:45,918 --> 01:10:47,849
聊天
just talkin'.

1161
01:10:47,921 --> 01:10:52,687
她告诉我她所有的旅行
She told me about all the traveling she'd done

1162
01:10:52,763 --> 01:10:56,629
她如何发现了新的思想
and how she discovered ways to expand her mind

1163
01:10:56,703 --> 01:11:00,255
学习怎样在和谐中生活…
and learn how to live in harmony...

1164
01:11:00,391 --> 01:11:02,288
和谐那地方一定是在我们西边
which must be out west somewhere,

1165
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,293
因为她一路去到了加州
'cause she made it all the way to California.

1166
01:11:05,365 --> 01:11:07,296
“去爱另一个人”
# Love one another right now #

1167
01:11:09,371 --> 01:11:11,667
有人想去旧金山吗？
Anybody want to go to San Francisco?

1168
01:11:11,742 --> 01:11:13,207
我要去
I'll go.

1169
01:11:13,278 --> 01:11:14,606
走啦！
Far out!

1170
01:11:14,679 --> 01:11:17,111
这是很特别的一晚
It was a very special night

1171
01:11:17,185 --> 01:11:18,878
对于我们俩来说
for the two of us.

1172
01:11:20,589 --> 01:11:22,520
我真的不想今晚结束
I didn't want it to end.

1173
01:11:23,693 --> 01:11:25,555
希望你不走 珍妮
Wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

1174
01:11:26,831 --> 01:11:28,352
我必须走 福雷斯
I have to, Forrest.

1175
01:11:29,834 --> 01:11:30,762
珍妮？
Jenny?

1176
01:11:32,606 --> 01:11:35,265
所有的事都乱套了
Things got a little out of hand.

1177
01:11:35,344 --> 01:11:36,934
都是因为这场战争
It's just this war

1178
01:11:37,012 --> 01:11:39,772
还有爱撒谎的约翰逊总统和…
and that lying son of a bitch Johnson and...

1179
01:11:41,186 --> 01:11:44,050
我永远不会伤害你 你知道的
I would never hurt you. You know that.

1180
01:11:46,861 --> 01:11:48,758
想知道我怎么想吗?
Know what I think?

1181
01:11:50,768 --> 01:11:52,198
我想…
I think...

1182
01:11:52,271 --> 01:11:54,293
你应该回绿茵镇的家
you should go home to Greenbow ,

1183
01:11:54,373 --> 01:11:56,361
亚拉巴马！
Alabama!

1184
01:12:06,393 --> 01:12:07,755
福雷斯
Forrest,

1185
01:12:08,895 --> 01:12:11,520
我们的人生完全不同 你知道
we have very different lives, you know.

1186
01:12:20,413 --> 01:12:22,344
我希望你…
I want you...

1187
01:12:22,417 --> 01:12:24,507
收下这个
to have this.

1188
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,348
福雷斯 我不能接受这个
Forrest, I can't keep this.

1189
01:12:32,364 --> 01:12:33,794
我能得到它…
I got it...

1190
01:12:33,867 --> 01:12:37,199
都是因为我做了你叫我做的事
just by doing what you told me to do.

1191
01:12:38,876 --> 01:12:42,140
你为何对我这么好？
Why are you so good to me?

1192
01:12:42,213 --> 01:12:44,041
你是我的女友
You're my girl.

1193
01:12:46,186 --> 01:12:47,879
我永远都是你的女友
I'll always be your girl.

1194
01:13:10,824 --> 01:13:15,783
“什么都在改变改变改变”
# To everything, turn, turn, turn #

1195
01:13:15,866 --> 01:13:20,360
“这是个改变改变改变的季节”
# There is a season, turn, turn, turn #

1196
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:24,204
“为了任何目标而开始的时刻”
# And a time to every purpose #

1197
01:13:24,278 --> 01:13:26,300
“在整个世界”
# Under heaven #

1198
01:13:27,485 --> 01:13:30,316
就是这样
And just like that,

1199
01:13:30,393 --> 01:13:35,426
他再次离开我的生活
she was gone out of my life again.

1200
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:37,950
这是个人的一小步
That's one small step for man,

1201
01:13:39,543 --> 01:13:41,983
人类的一大步
one giant leap for mankind.

1202
01:13:47,963 --> 01:13:49,161
我以为我要回越南去
I thought I was going back to Vietnam,

1203
01:13:50,598 --> 01:13:51,907
但他们又觉得
but instead they decided

1204
01:13:51,919 --> 01:13:54,121
我对付共产党的最好办法
the best way for me to fight the Communists

1205
01:13:54,127 --> 01:13:56,075
是打乒乓球
was to play Ping-Pong,

1206
01:13:56,084 --> 01:13:58,299
于是我接受了一个特别任务
so I was in the special Services,

1207
01:13:58,328 --> 01:13:59,832
走遍全国
traveling around the country,

1208
01:13:59,928 --> 01:14:02,579
慰劳负伤的老兵 为他们表演
cheering up wounded veterans and showing'em

1209
01:14:02,635 --> 01:14:03,975
怎么打乒乓球
how to play Ping-Pong.

1210
01:14:04,322 --> 01:14:05,217
我打得很好 所以几年后
I was so good that some years later,

1211
01:14:05,289 --> 01:14:07,297
军队又觉得我应该
the army decided I should be

1212
01:14:07,374 --> 01:14:09,659
加入全美乒乓球队
on the all-American Ping-Pong team.

1213
01:14:09,742 --> 01:14:13,197
我们是第一批访问中国大陆的美国人
We were the first Americans to visit the land of China

1214
01:14:13,275 --> 01:14:15,813
大约一百万年以来
in a million years or something.

1215
01:14:15,891 --> 01:14:18,997
有人说世界和平就在我们手中
Somebody said world peace was in our hands,

1216
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:21,923
但我所做的只不过是打乒乓球
but all I did was play Ping-Pong.

1217
01:14:22,004 --> 01:14:25,037
回家以后 我成了全国有名的人物
When I got home, I was a national celebrity ,

1218
01:14:25,113 --> 01:14:27,010
比袋鼠船长还要有名
famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.

1219
01:14:28,049 --> 01:14:29,980
这位就是福雷斯甘
Here he is, Forrest Gump.

1220
01:14:30,052 --> 01:14:31,415
在这儿
Right here.

1221
01:14:37,259 --> 01:14:40,227
阿甘 请坐
Gump, have a seat.

1222
01:14:40,296 --> 01:14:43,058
福雷斯甘 这位是约翰列侬
Forrest Gump, John Lennon.

1223
01:14:43,133 --> 01:14:45,064
欢迎你回国
Welcome home.

1224
01:14:45,134 --> 01:14:47,065
你能不能告诉我们 嗯
Can you tell us, um,

1225
01:14:47,137 --> 01:14:49,261
中国是怎么样的？
what was China like?

1226
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:54,566
在中国大陆…
In the land of China...

1227
01:14:54,648 --> 01:14:56,579
人们差不多什么都没有
people hardly got nothin'at all.

1228
01:14:56,649 --> 01:14:58,807
没有财产？
No possessions?

1229
01:15:01,289 --> 01:15:06,087
在中国 他们不去教堂
And in China, they never go to church.

1230
01:15:06,161 --> 01:15:07,592
也没有宗教？
No religion, too?

1231
01:15:09,665 --> 01:15:11,254
难以想象
Hard to imagine.

1232
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:14,596
嗯 只要你肯试着想象 迪克
Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.

1233
01:15:14,672 --> 01:15:16,103
几年以后
Some years later,

1234
01:15:16,173 --> 01:15:18,104
那位从英格兰来的好年青人
that nice young man from England

1235
01:15:18,175 --> 01:15:21,143
他回家去看他的孩子
was on his way home to see his little boy

1236
01:15:21,213 --> 01:15:23,110
半路上在给人签名
and was signing some autographs.

1237
01:15:23,181 --> 01:15:25,043
完全没什么原因
For no particular reason at all,

1238
01:15:25,118 --> 01:15:27,583
有人枪杀了他
Somebody shot him.

1239
01:15:30,124 --> 01:15:32,055
他们给你…
They gave you...

1247
01:15:52,048 --> 01:15:53,569

让你这白痴上电视
a moron who goes on television

1249

让你去出丑

1250
01:15:58,157 --> 01:16:01,125
在整个该死的国家面前

1251
01:16:01,193 --> 01:16:03,522
国会荣誉勋章

1254
01:16:11,472 --> 01:16:15,166
嗯 我对此只能说一句话…
Yeah, well, I just got one thing to say to that...

1255
01:16:15,243 --> 01:16:17,607
上帝诅咒美国
Goddamn bless America.

1256
01:16:21,284 --> 01:16:23,943
啊 天哪
Oh, God, whoa!

1259
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,551
丹中尉说他住在一家旅馆里

1260
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:34,563
因为他没有腿

1261
01:16:34,633 --> 01:16:37,567
他花很多时间练习他们手臂

1262
01:16:39,674 --> 01:16:41,571
向右转 向右！

1263
01:16:46,915 --> 01:16:50,575
你在纽约做什么 丹中尉？

You have a great year, and hurry home.

1272
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,947
上帝保佑你
God bless you.

1273
01:17:24,193 --> 01:17:27,319
你找到耶稣了吗 阿甘？
Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

1274
01:17:28,765 --> 01:17:32,630
我不知道我应该去找他 长官
I didn't know I was supposed to be looking for Him, sir.

1275
01:17:38,645 --> 01:17:42,101
从越南回来的残废军人
That's all these cripples down at the V. A....

1276
01:17:42,182 --> 01:17:45,581
他们都这么说
That's all they ever talk about.

1277
01:17:45,654 --> 01:17:49,884
耶稣这个耶稣那个 哈
Jesus this and Jesus that. Ha.

1278
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:53,447
我…找到耶稣了吗？
Have I...found Jesus?

1279
01:17:53,529 --> 01:17:56,963
他们还叫了个牧师来和我聊天
They even had a priest come and talk to me.

1280
01:17:57,032 --> 01:17:59,588
他说上帝在听着
He said God is listening,

1281
01:17:59,669 --> 01:18:02,603
但我只能顾到自己
but I have to help myself.

1282
01:18:02,674 --> 01:18:05,608
如果我的心能接受耶稣
Now, if I accept Jesus into my heart,

1283
01:18:05,677 --> 01:18:10,112
我就可以与他在天国同行
I'll get to walk beside Him in the kingdom of heaven.

1284
01:18:10,181 --> 01:18:12,408
你听到我说的话了吗？
Did you hear what I said?

1285
01:18:13,688 --> 01:18:15,482
同行…
Walk...

1286
01:18:15,554 --> 01:18:18,110
与他在天国同行
beside Him in the kingdom of heaven.

1287
01:18:18,191 --> 01:18:20,622
嗯…去你妈的
Well...kiss my crippled ass.

1288
01:18:20,695 --> 01:18:22,626
上帝在听着？
God is listening?

1289
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,754
全是狗屁
What a crock of shit.

1290
01:18:27,704 --> 01:18:30,192
我要上天堂 丹中尉

1295
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:47,868
帮我再打点酒？

1296
01:18:47,945 --> 01:18:48,966

有捕虾船
Shrimping boats.

1302
01:18:59,728 --> 01:19:03,162
捕虾船？捕虾船关我什么事？
Shrimping boats? Who gives a shit about shrimping boats?

我在越南答应过布巴的

1306
01:19:08,737 --> 01:19:12,171
等战争结束 我们合伙捕虾

1317
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:44,644
如果你能当捕虾船的船长
If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,

1319
01:19:46,717 --> 01:19:48,648

最近一直没见你

1328
01:20:04,238 --> 01:20:06,669
你应该在这儿过圣诞节的

1329
01:20:06,742 --> 01:20:08,673
汤米请大伙喝酒

1330
01:20:08,742 --> 01:20:10,673
每人一块火鸡三明治

每人都有新的机会
Everybody gets a second chance.

1337
01:20:23,762 --> 01:20:25,125
很奇怪…
It's funny...

1338
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:28,129
在这欢乐的气氛中
but in the middle of all that fun,

1339
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:30,027
我想起了珍妮
I began to think about Jenny,

1340
01:20:30,101 --> 01:20:33,535
不知她会如何庆祝除夕夜

“你对她的爱不再疯狂？”

1347
01:20:52,363 --> 01:20:57,161
“你不再爱正在离开的她？”
# Don't you love her as she's walkin' out the door? #

1348
01:20:57,234 --> 01:20:58,665

“怎能忘记旧日朋友”
# Should auld acquaintance be forgot #

1355
01:21:21,265 --> 01:21:24,199
“心中能不怀想？”

1356
01:21:24,268 --> 01:21:27,133
新年快乐 丹中尉！

“让我们一起工作”

1366
01:22:01,745 --> 01:22:04,176

我想丹中尉发现

有些事你是无法改变的

01:24:24,652 --> 01:24:26,012
是新开张的水门酒店 设备很先进
It's brand-new. Very modern.

1411
01:24:26,087 --> 01:24:28,707
我会叫人安排你入住的
I'll have my people take care of it.

1412
01:24:28,784 --> 01:24:30,007
保安
Security.

1413
01:24:30,084 --> 01:24:31,512
是 先生
Yeah. Sir,

1414
01:24:31,584 --> 01:24:34,514
你能不能叫人维修人员
you might want to send a maintenance man

1415
01:24:34,582 --> 01:24:37,009
去对面办公室看看
over to that office across the way .

1416
01:24:37,079 --> 01:24:38,507
里面灯不亮
The lights are off

1417
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:41,510
他们大概正在找保险丝盒
and they must be looking for a fuse box ,

1418
01:24:41,578 --> 01:24:44,508
因为他们打着手电 把我都照醒了
'cause them flashlights, they're keeping me awake .

1419
01:24:44,576 --> 01:24:46,504
好的 先生。我去查一下
O.K., sir. I'll check it out.

1420
01:24:46,575 --> 01:24:47,867
谢谢 晚安
Thank you. Good night.

1421
01:24:51,074 --> 01:24:52,502
因此…
Therefore...

1422
01:24:52,573 --> 01:24:54,501
我将辞去总统职位
I shall resign the presidency

1423
01:24:54,571 --> 01:24:56,829
从明天中午起生效
effective at noon tomorrow.

1424
01:24:56,904 --> 01:24:58,832
福特副总统
Vice President Ford

1425
01:24:58,903 --> 01:25:00,990
将宣誓就任总统
will be sworn in as president

1426
01:25:01,069 --> 01:25:03,723
明天此时在这间办公室
at that hour in this office.

1427
01:25:14,829 --> 01:25:16,291
福雷斯甘
Forrest Gump.

1428
01:25:16,362 --> 01:25:17,983
是 长官！
Yes, sir!

1429
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:19,488
根据条例
As you were.

1430
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,488
我收到你的退役批文
I have your discharge papers.

1431
01:25:21,557 --> 01:25:23,212
服役期结束了 孩子
Service is up, son.

1432
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:28,781
是不是说我不能再打乒乓球了？
Does this mean I can't play Ping-Pong no more?

1433
01:25:28,854 --> 01:25:30,817
对军队来说 是的
For the army, it does.

1434
01:25:32,986 --> 01:25:34,914
就这样
And just like that,

1435
01:25:34,985 --> 01:25:38,413
我在合众国军队的生活结束了
my service in the United States Army was over.

1436
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:44,943
所以我回家
So I went home.

1437
01:26:06,603 --> 01:26:08,122
我回家了 妈妈
I'm home, Mama.

1438
01:26:08,203 --> 01:26:10,596
我知道 我知道
I know. I know .

1439
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:13,394
露西 他来了
Louise, he's here .

1440
01:26:13,466 --> 01:26:16,396
当我回家时 我不知道做什么
Now, when I got home, I had no idea,

1441
01:26:16,465 --> 01:26:18,892
但妈妈有很多访客
but Mama had all sorts of visitors.

1442
01:26:18,964 --> 01:26:20,892
我们有客人来访
We've had all sorts of visitors .

1443
01:26:20,963 --> 01:26:24,391
每个人都想要你用他们的乒乓器材
Everybody wants you to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

1444
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:27,320
有个人还留了一张两万五的支票
One man even left a check for $25,000

1445
01:26:27,393 --> 01:26:30,821
希望你能说：你爱用他们的球拍
if you'd be agree able to saying you like using their paddle.

1446
01:26:30,892 --> 01:26:33,822
我只爱用我自己的球拍
I only like using my own paddle.

1447
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:35,284
嗨 露西小姐
Hi, Miss Louise.

1448
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:36,342
嘿 福雷斯
Hey, Forrest.

1449
01:26:36,422 --> 01:26:39,317
我知道 可那是两万五啊 福雷斯
I know that, but it's $25,000, Forrest.

1450
01:26:39,387 --> 01:26:42,815
我想也许你可以试用一段时间
I thought maybe you could hold it for a while,

1451
01:26:42,885 --> 01:26:45,312
看看顺不顺手
see if it grows on you.

1452
01:26:45,385 --> 01:26:47,313
妈妈的确说得对
That Mama, she sure was right.

1453
01:26:47,384 --> 01:26:50,071
事情总是出乎意料
It's funny how things work out.

1454
01:26:50,208 --> 01:26:52,102
我在家没有待太久
I didn't stay home for long

1455
01:26:52,173 --> 01:26:54,600
因为我答应过布巴
because I'd made apromise to Bubba,

1456
01:26:54,672 --> 01:26:57,099
我总要信守我的诺言
and I always try to keep my promise,

1457
01:26:57,171 --> 01:26:59,598
所以我去了拉巴特湾
so I went on down to Bayou La Batre

1458
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:01,155
去见布巴的家人
to meet Bubba's family.

1459
01:27:01,234 --> 01:27:05,627
你是疯子还是傻瓜？
Are you crazy or just plain stupid?

1460
01:27:05,701 --> 01:27:08,924
做傻事的才是傻瓜 布鲁太太
Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.

1461
01:27:08,998 --> 01:27:09,926
我想也是
I guess.

1462
01:27:09,998 --> 01:27:11,426
当然
And, of course,

1463
01:27:11,497 --> 01:27:14,584
我也去看望了布巴本人
I paid my respect to Bubba himself.

1464
01:27:15,828 --> 01:27:18,482
嘿 布巴 是我 福雷斯甘
Hey, Bubba. It's me, Forrest Gump.

1465
01:27:21,826 --> 01:27:23,754
我记得你说过的话
I remember everything you said,

1466
01:27:23,825 --> 01:27:26,685
我已经安排好了
and I got it all figured out.

1467
01:27:28,356 --> 01:27:34,975
我带来两万四千五百六十二块四毛七分
I'm taking $24,562.47

1468
01:27:35,052 --> 01:27:37,173
这是我所有的钱
that I got, that's left

1469
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,679
其它钱用来理发和买新衣服
after a new hair cut and a new suit

1470
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:42,680
还有带妈妈上街吃了一顿好饭
and took Mama out to a real fancy dinner,

1471
01:27:42,748 --> 01:27:45,608
还买了车票 还买了三瓶汽水
and I bought a bus ticket, then three Dr. Peppers.

1472
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,666
告诉我
Tell me something.

1473
01:27:47,746 --> 01:27:50,173
你是傻瓜吗？
Are you stupid or something?

1474
01:27:50,245 --> 01:27:52,933
做傻事的才是傻瓜 先生
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1475
01:27:53,011 --> 01:27:54,939
我拿到这些钱是因为我说：
That's what's left after me saying,

1476
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:58,938
“我和全美乒乓球队在中国时 
"When I was in China on the all-America Ping-Pong team,

1477
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:00,935
“我最喜欢打乒乓球…
"I just loved playing Ping-Pong

1478
01:28:01,007 --> 01:28:03,128
“用我的菲利奥莱乒乓球拍”
with my Flex-O-Lite Ping-Pong paddle,"

1479
01:28:03,204 --> 01:28:05,132
谁都知道这不是真话
which everybody knows isn't true,

1480
01:28:05,203 --> 01:28:08,133
但妈妈说它只是一个善意的谎话
but Mama said it was just a little white lie,

1481
01:28:08,202 --> 01:28:10,130
它不会伤害任何人
so it wasn't hurting nobody.

1482
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:12,629
总之 剩下的钱我全部用来
So anyway, I'm putting all that

1483
01:28:12,701 --> 01:28:15,128
买燃料、绳索和网具
on gas, ropes, and new nets

1484
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:18,130
以及一条全新的捕虾船
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1485
01:28:39,222 --> 01:28:42,650
布巴告诉过我所有和捕虾有关的事情
Now Bubba told me everything he knew about shrimping,

1486
01:28:42,718 --> 01:28:45,648
但你知道我有什么发现吗？
but you know what I found out?

1487
01:28:46,718 --> 01:28:49,270
捕虾很难的
Shrimping is tough.

1488
01:28:51,215 --> 01:28:53,869
我只捕到五只
I only caught five .

1489
01:28:53,946 --> 01:28:57,374
再来两只 你就能做串烧虾了
A couple more, you can have yourself a cocktail.

1490
01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:02,140
嘿 你有没有想过该为这条船命名？
Hey, you ever think about naming this old boat?

1491
01:29:02,209 --> 01:29:05,139
船没有名字就没有好运气
It's bad luck to have a boat without a name.

1492
01:29:05,207 --> 01:29:07,634
我以前从来没有给船命名
I'd never named a boat before,

1493
01:29:07,706 --> 01:29:12,724
我能想起的只有一个名字
but there was only one I could think of,

1494
01:29:12,804 --> 01:29:16,755
世界上最美丽的名字
the most beautiful name in the wide world.

1495
01:29:20,834 --> 01:29:22,319
“跳跳舞”
# Do a little dance #

1496
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:24,362
“谈谈情”
# Make a little love #

1497
01:29:24,431 --> 01:29:26,359
“度过今晚”
# Get down tonight#

1498
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:28,721
“度过今晚”
# Get down tonight#

1499
01:29:28,797 --> 01:29:30,985
“跳跳舞”
# Do a little dance #

1500
01:29:31,062 --> 01:29:32,819
“谈谈情”
# Make a little love #

1501
01:29:32,896 --> 01:29:34,517
“度过今晚”
# Get down tonight#

1502
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,052
“度过今晚…”
# Get down tonight... #

1503
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:39,518
我没听到珍妮的消息
Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny

1504
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:40,882
已经很久了
in a long while,

1505
01:29:40,957 --> 01:29:43,384
但我仍经常想念她
but I thought about her a lot.

1506
01:29:43,457 --> 01:29:46,544
不管她在做什么 我希望她开心
I hoped whatever she was doing made her happy.

1507
01:29:46,623 --> 01:29:51,641
“你不能改变那只小鸟”
# Oh, and the bird you cannot change #

1508
01:29:55,084 --> 01:30:01,771
“你不能改变这只小鸟”
# And this bird you cannot change #

1509
01:30:01,848 --> 01:30:09,217
“上天知道我无法改变”
# Lord knows I can't change #

1510
01:30:09,289 --> 01:30:16,220
“上天保佑我无法改变”
# Lord, help me, I can't change #

1511
01:31:32,438 --> 01:31:35,874
我时刻想念着珍妮
I thought about Jenny all the time.

1512
01:32:25,424 --> 01:32:30,020
丹中尉 你来做什么？
Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing here?

1513
01:32:30,095 --> 01:32:33,462
嗯 我想到海中施展拳脚
Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs.

1514
01:32:33,533 --> 01:32:36,468
可是你没有脚了 丹中尉
Well, you ain't got no legs, Lieutenant Dan.

1515
01:32:36,536 --> 01:32:37,969
是的 我知道
Yes, I know that.

1516
01:32:38,038 --> 01:32:42,236
你写了封信给我 白痴
You wrote me a letter, you idiot.

1517
01:32:42,309 --> 01:32:44,675
好了 福雷斯甘船长
Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.

1518
01:32:44,746 --> 01:32:47,613
我要亲眼来看看…
I had to see this for myself...

1519
01:32:48,917 --> 01:32:50,384
并且…
and...

1520
01:32:50,453 --> 01:32:54,890
我说过如果你能当捕虾船的船长
I told you if you were ever a shrimp boat captain,

1521
01:32:54,957 --> 01:32:56,891
我就来当你的大副
that I'd be your first mate.

1522
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,621
所以我来了
Well, here I am.

1523
01:32:58,695 --> 01:33:00,629
我是信守诺言的
I'm a man of my word .

1524
01:33:00,697 --> 01:33:01,721
好的
O.K.

1525
01:33:01,799 --> 01:33:03,960
但你别以为
But don't you be thinking

1526
01:33:04,035 --> 01:33:06,469
我会叫你长官
that I'm going to be calling you "sir."

1527
01:33:06,537 --> 01:33:07,469
不用 长官
No, sir.

1528
01:33:16,016 --> 01:33:17,540
这是我的船
It's my boat.

1529
01:33:20,721 --> 01:33:24,817
我觉得如果我们向东开
I have a feeling if we head due east,

1530
01:33:24,892 --> 01:33:28,453
我们就会找到虾 现在左转
we'll find some shrimp, so take a left.

1531
01:33:29,865 --> 01:33:31,298
向左转！
Take a left!

1532
01:33:31,366 --> 01:33:32,298
哪边？
Which way?

1533
01:33:32,368 --> 01:33:33,300
那边！
Over there!

1534
01:33:33,369 --> 01:33:34,802
他们在那边！
They're over there!

1535
01:33:34,871 --> 01:33:38,204
快打舵盘向左
Get on the wheel and take a left.

1536
01:33:38,275 --> 01:33:39,708
好的
O.K.

1537
01:33:41,045 --> 01:33:42,979
阿甘 你干什么？
Gump, what are you doing?

1538
01:33:43,047 --> 01:33:44,480
向左转！
Take a left!

1539
01:33:44,549 --> 01:33:45,538
左边！
Left!

1540
01:33:47,419 --> 01:33:51,355
那边我们会找到虾的 兄弟！
That's where we're going to find those shrimp, my boy!

1541
01:33:52,425 --> 01:33:54,552
那边我们会找到它们
That's where we'll find them.

1542
01:34:06,974 --> 01:34:08,908
还是没有虾 丹中尉
Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.

1543
01:34:08,977 --> 01:34:10,911
好吧 我弄错了
O.K., so I was wrong.

1544
01:34:10,979 --> 01:34:13,914
嗯 我们怎么才能找到虾呢？
Well, how are we going to find them?

1545
01:34:13,983 --> 01:34:18,010
也许你可以去祷告
Maybe you should just pray for shrimp.

1546
01:34:18,088 --> 01:34:20,750
“所以我们祷告”
# So pray that #

1547
01:34:20,825 --> 01:34:24,090
“我在回家路上…”
# I'm homeward bound... #

1548
01:34:24,161 --> 01:34:26,857
所以我每个星期天都去教堂
So I went to church every Sunday.

1549
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:30,234
有时丹中尉也来
Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,

1550
01:34:30,302 --> 01:34:34,170
虽然他只让我负责祷告
though I think he left the praying up to me.

1551
01:34:48,690 --> 01:34:50,089
没有虾
No shrimp.

1552
01:34:51,193 --> 01:34:54,128
你那上帝到底在哪儿？
Where the hell's this God of yours?

1553
01:34:54,196 --> 01:34:56,630
奇怪的是丹中尉一说这话
It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that

1554
01:34:56,700 --> 01:35:00,517
上帝就来了
'cause right then God showed up.

1555
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:18,603
你绝不能弄沉这条船！
You'll never sink this boat!

1556
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:21,333
我当时很害怕
Now, me, I was scared,

1557
01:35:21,408 --> 01:35:25,469
但丹中尉 他象是发疯了
but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.

1558
01:35:25,546 --> 01:35:26,535
来吧！
Come on!

1559
01:35:29,083 --> 01:35:31,381
你这算是风暴吗？
You call this a storm?

1560
01:35:31,453 --> 01:35:35,389
来吧 你这狗娘养的！
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1561
01:35:35,458 --> 01:35:39,394
咱们来较量一下吧！
It's time for a show down!

1562
01:35:39,463 --> 01:35:40,930
你和我！
You and me!

1563
01:35:40,997 --> 01:35:44,057
我就在这儿 来捉我吧！
I'm right here! Come and get me!

1564
01:35:46,737 --> 01:35:48,170
你绝不能弄沉…
You'll never sink...

1565
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:49,536
这条…
this...

1566
01:35:49,607 --> 01:35:50,699
船！
boat!

1567
01:35:52,778 --> 01:35:54,873
卡门飓风昨天过境
Hurricane Carmen came through here yesterday,

1568
01:35:55,006 --> 01:35:56,803
沿途几乎摧毁了一切
destroying nearly everything in its path.

1569
01:35:56,876 --> 01:35:59,811
沿海的其他城镇也一样
And as in other towns up and down the coast,

1570
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:02,677
拉巴特湾的捕虾业
Bayou La Batre's entire shrimping industry

1571
01:36:02,749 --> 01:36:05,081
成为卡门飓风的最大受害者
has fallen victim to Carmen

1572
01:36:05,152 --> 01:36:07,985
渔港完全成了废墟
and has been left in utter ruin.

1573
01:36:08,054 --> 01:36:09,487
记者被告知
This reporter has learned,

1574
01:36:09,557 --> 01:36:11,991
实际上只有一条捕虾船
in fact, only one shrimping boat

1575
01:36:12,059 --> 01:36:13,583
幸免于难
actually survived the storm.

1576
01:36:13,661 --> 01:36:16,129
露西 露西 福雷斯来了
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

1577
01:36:16,198 --> 01:36:19,292
从此以后 捕虾就很容易了
After that, shrimping was easy.

1578
01:36:19,368 --> 01:36:22,132
“将会有丰厚的回报”
# There will be great bounty #

1579
01:36:22,205 --> 01:36:24,867
“我的上帝…”
# Oh, my God... #

1580
01:36:24,941 --> 01:36:26,875
因为人们仍然需要虾
Since people still needed them shrimps

1581
01:36:26,944 --> 01:36:29,310
来做虾串烧和虾烧烤什么的
for shrimp cocktails and barbecues and all

1582
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:32,315
而我们的船是唯一剩下的了
and we were the only boat left standing,

1583
01:36:32,383 --> 01:36:34,817
他们只能来布巴甘这里买虾
Bubba Gump shrimp's what they got.

1584
01:36:34,886 --> 01:36:37,821
我们购置了一大堆船
We got a whole bunch of boats.

1585
01:36:37,889 --> 01:36:39,823
有12条珍妮号 还有一个大仓库
12 Jennys, big old warehouse.

1586
01:36:39,892 --> 01:36:41,826
我们还订做了帽子
We even have hats

1587
01:36:41,894 --> 01:36:44,328
上面写着“布巴甘”
that say "Bubba Gump" on them.

1588
01:36:44,397 --> 01:36:45,830
布巴甘捕虾公司
Bubba Gump Shrimp.

1589
01:36:45,899 --> 01:36:47,332
这名字家喻户晓
It's a household name.

1590
01:36:47,401 --> 01:36:49,062
等等 小兄弟
Hold on there, boy.

1591
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:51,570
你是说你就是…
Are you telling me you're the owner

1592
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:53,869
布巴捕虾公司的老板？
of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation?

1593
01:36:53,942 --> 01:36:56,877
对 我们挣了一大堆钱
Yes. We got more money than Davy Crockett.

1594
01:36:56,946 --> 01:36:59,881
孩子 我听过很多牛皮
Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,

1595
01:36:59,949 --> 01:37:02,884
这是最大的一个
but that tops them all.

1596
01:37:04,988 --> 01:37:08,389
我们身边正坐着一个百万富翁
We were sitting next to a millionaire .

1597
01:37:11,395 --> 01:37:16,389
嗯 我觉得那是个很有趣的故事
Well, I thought it was a very lovely story,

1598
01:37:16,468 --> 01:37:19,528
你讲得真好
and you tell it so well,

1599
01:37:19,605 --> 01:37:21,698
非常热情洋溢
with such enthusiasm.

1600
01:37:21,774 --> 01:37:25,870
你想看看丹中尉长什么样吗？
Would you like to see what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

1601
01:37:25,945 --> 01:37:28,175
是的 我想看
Yes, I would.

1602
01:37:32,453 --> 01:37:34,080
这个就是他
That's him right there .

1603
01:37:36,324 --> 01:37:39,384
我再讲点关于丹中尉的事
Let me tell you something about Lieutenant Dan.

1604
01:37:39,462 --> 01:37:40,952
福雷斯…
Forrest...

1605
01:37:46,136 --> 01:37:50,266
我一直还没谢谢你救我一命
I never thanked you for saving my life .

1606
01:38:15,470 --> 01:38:17,904
他从来没说出来
He never actually said so,

1607
01:38:17,973 --> 01:38:22,342
但我想他跟上帝已经讲和了
but I think he made his peace with God.

1608
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:31,917
这是17天里第二次
For the second time in 17 days,

1609
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:34,423
福特总幸免被刺杀
President Ford escaped possible assassination today.

1610
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:37,427
总部呼叫珍妮一号。总部呼叫珍妮一号
Base to Jenny 1. Base to Jenny 1.

1611
01:38:37,495 --> 01:38:38,928
珍妮一号 请说
Jenny 1. Go, Margo.

1612
01:38:38,998 --> 01:38:40,932
有福雷斯的电话
Forrest has a phone call.

1613
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:45,437
嗯 你跟他说他迟点再回电话
Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them to call him back.

1614
01:38:45,505 --> 01:38:47,939
他现在很忙
He is indisposed at the moment.

1615
01:38:48,008 --> 01:38:49,475
他妈妈病了
His mama's sick.

1616
01:39:08,565 --> 01:39:09,497
妈妈在哪儿？
Where's Mama?

1617
01:39:09,567 --> 01:39:11,364
她在楼上
She's upstairs .

1618
01:39:13,804 --> 01:39:15,533
嗨 福雷斯
Hi, Forrest.

1619
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:17,802
明天见
I'll see you tomorrow .

1620
01:39:17,876 --> 01:39:19,173
好的
Oh, all right.

1621
01:39:25,551 --> 01:39:28,384
你的腿全好了 是吗 孩子？
Sure got you straightened out, didn't we, boy?

1622
01:39:40,569 --> 01:39:42,059
怎么了 妈妈？
What's the matter, Mama?

1623
01:39:42,138 --> 01:39:45,301
我快死了 福雷斯
I'm dying, Forrest.

1624
01:39:47,444 --> 01:39:50,345
进来 坐下
Come on in, sit down over here .

1625
01:40:04,064 --> 01:40:06,191
为什么你快死了 妈妈？
Why are you dying, Mama?

1626
01:40:06,266 --> 01:40:08,359
我的时候到了
It's my time.

1627
01:40:08,435 --> 01:40:11,495
因为我的时候到了
It's just my time.

1628
01:40:11,572 --> 01:40:13,597
现在…
Oh, now...

1629
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:17,235
你不用害怕 宝贝
don't you be afraid, sweet heart .

1630
01:40:17,312 --> 01:40:20,713
死亡只是生命的一部分
Death is just a part of life .

1631
01:40:20,782 --> 01:40:24,741
是我们注定要面对的
Something we're all destined to do.

1632
01:40:24,821 --> 01:40:27,153
我并不知道
I didn't know it,

1633
01:40:27,223 --> 01:40:30,158
但我注定要做你的妈妈
but I was destined to be your mama.

1634
01:40:30,227 --> 01:40:32,957
我就尽力做好
I did the best I could.

1635
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:34,964
你做得很好
You did good.

1636
01:40:35,033 --> 01:40:41,303
嗯…我相信你能实现自己的命运
Well...I happen to believe you make your own destiny .

1637
01:40:41,373 --> 01:40:45,901
你要凭着上帝所给予的做到最好
You have to do the best with what God gave you.

1638
01:40:49,416 --> 01:40:52,010
我的命运是什么 妈妈？
What's my destiny, Mama?

1639
01:40:52,086 --> 01:40:56,523
你要自己去弄明白
You're going to have to figure that out for yourself.

1640
01:40:57,860 --> 01:41:00,795
人生就像一盒各式各样的巧克力
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.

1641
01:41:00,863 --> 01:41:03,798
你永远不知道下一块将会是哪种
You never know what you're going to get.

1642
01:41:03,867 --> 01:41:06,802
妈妈总有办法把事情说清楚
Mama always hada way of explaining things

1643
01:41:06,870 --> 01:41:08,804
让我也能听明白
so I could understand them.

1644
01:41:08,872 --> 01:41:10,339
我会想念你的 福雷斯
I will miss you, Forrest.

1645
01:41:12,076 --> 01:41:14,340
她得了癌症
She had got the cancer

1646
01:41:14,411 --> 01:41:16,345
在星期二去世了
and died on a Tuesday.

1647
01:41:16,414 --> 01:41:19,008
我给她买了顶新帽子
I bought her a new hat

1648
01:41:19,084 --> 01:41:21,109
上面有很多小花
with little flowers on it.

1649
01:41:24,056 --> 01:41:26,752
我要说的说是这么多了
And that's all I have to say about that.

1650
01:41:34,035 --> 01:41:36,731
你不是说你在等7路车吗？
Didn't you say you were waiting for the number 7 bus?

1651
01:41:36,804 --> 01:41:39,534
等一下还会有下一班车的
There'll be another one along shortly.

1652
01:41:43,045 --> 01:41:47,482
现在因为我成了足球明星和战争英雄
Now, because I had been a football star and war hero

1653
01:41:47,551 --> 01:41:50,486
以及全国知名的人物和捕虾船的船长
and national celebrity and a shrimping boat captain

1654
01:41:50,554 --> 01:41:51,987
以及大学毕业生
and a college graduate,

1655
01:41:52,056 --> 01:41:54,490
亚拉巴马州绿茵镇的父老乡亲
the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama,

1656
01:41:54,559 --> 01:41:57,050
决定给我一个好工作
decided to get together and offered me a fine job.

1657
01:41:58,564 --> 01:42:02,091
所以我不再回去和丹中尉一起工作了
So I never went back to work for Lieutenant Dan,

1658
01:42:02,167 --> 01:42:05,102
但他继续打理着我们布巴甘公司的财产
though he did take care of my Bubba Gump money.

1659
01:42:05,171 --> 01:42:08,106
他替我买了一家卖苹果的公司的股票
He got me invested in some kind of fruit company.

1660
01:42:08,174 --> 01:42:10,608
后有他打电话给我
So then I got a call from him

1661
01:42:10,678 --> 01:42:13,238
说我们再也不用担心没钱花了
saying we don't have to worry about money no more,

1662
01:42:13,314 --> 01:42:17,717
我说：“好啊 又少一件麻烦事”
and I said, "That's good. One less thing."

1663
01:42:17,786 --> 01:42:19,583
“我有了新的希望…”
# I've got a new hope... #

1664
01:42:19,654 --> 01:42:22,088
妈妈说过财产不用太多
Now Mama said there's only so much fortune

1665
01:42:22,158 --> 01:42:23,785
一个人用不了多少
a man really needs,

1666
01:42:23,859 --> 01:42:27,260
多余的钱只是用来炫耀
and the rest is just for showing off.

1667
01:42:27,330 --> 01:42:30,231
所以我拿出一大堆
So I gave a whole bunch of it

1668
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:33,565
给四方福音教堂…
to the Four square Gospel Church...

1669
01:42:33,637 --> 01:42:38,700
又拿出一大堆给拉巴特湾渔场医院…
and I gave a whole bunch to the Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital...

1670
01:42:40,179 --> 01:42:42,613
虽然布巴已经死了
and even though Bubba was dead

1671
01:42:42,681 --> 01:42:46,117
丹中尉也说我是笨蛋
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,

1672
01:42:46,186 --> 01:42:48,916
我还是把布巴那一份给了布巴的妈妈
I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.

1673
01:42:52,293 --> 01:42:53,954
你猜怎么着？
You know what?

1674
01:42:54,028 --> 01:42:57,964
她再也不用去任何人家的厨房干活了
She didn't have to work in nobody's kitchen no more.

1675
01:42:58,032 --> 01:43:00,626
那感觉真不错
That smells wonderful.

1676
01:43:00,702 --> 01:43:03,136
因为我成了亿万富翁
And 'cause I was a gozillionaire

1677
01:43:03,205 --> 01:43:06,140
并且我喜欢干活
and I liked doing it so much,

1678
01:43:06,209 --> 01:43:09,645
我免费帮他们割草
I cut that grass for free.

1679
01:43:11,081 --> 01:43:14,517
但到了晚上无事可干
But at night time when there was nothing to do

1680
01:43:14,585 --> 01:43:17,019
房子空空荡荡的
and the house was all empty,

1681
01:43:17,088 --> 01:43:20,023
我会经常想念珍妮
I'd always think of Jenny.

1682
01:44:23,539 --> 01:44:27,339
然后…她就出现了
And then...she was there.

1683
01:45:00,114 --> 01:45:01,411
你好 福雷斯
Hello, Forrest.

1684
01:45:01,483 --> 01:45:03,678
你好 珍妮
Hello, Jenny .

1685
01:45:14,531 --> 01:45:17,659
珍妮回来与我一起住
Jenny came back and stayed with me.

1686
01:45:17,735 --> 01:45:22,570
也许因为她没什么别的地方可去了
Maybe it was because she had no where else to go,

1687
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:26,007
也许因为她太累了
or maybe it was because she was so tired

1688
01:45:26,078 --> 01:45:29,514
因为她总是在睡觉
'cause she went to bed and slept and slept

1689
01:45:29,582 --> 01:45:31,812
好象她多年没睡觉了
like she hadn't slept in years.

1690
01:45:31,885 --> 01:45:34,251
有她在家真好
It was wonderful having her home.

1691
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,754
每天我们都散步
Every day we'd take a walk,

1692
01:45:36,824 --> 01:45:40,760
我不停地跟她说话
and I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,

1693
01:45:40,829 --> 01:45:43,764
她听我说乒乓球和捕虾
and she'd listen about Ping-Ponging and shrimping

1694
01:45:43,832 --> 01:45:46,767
还有妈妈去天堂的事
and Mama making a trip up to heaven.

1695
01:45:46,836 --> 01:45:48,770
我不停地说
I did all the talking.

1696
01:45:48,838 --> 01:45:51,329
珍妮总是很安静
Jenny most of the time was real quiet.

1697
01:46:30,987 --> 01:46:33,717
你怎么能这么做？
How could you do this?

1698
01:47:11,033 --> 01:47:15,527
有时我想石头会不够用
Sometimes I guess there just aren't enough rocks.

1699
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,975
我一直不知道她为什么回来
I never really knew why she came back,

1700
01:47:20,044 --> 01:47:21,477
但我不介意
but I didn't care.

1701
01:47:21,545 --> 01:47:23,479
就象昔日重来
It was like olden times.

1702
01:47:23,548 --> 01:47:26,346
我们又形影不离了
We was like peas and carrots again.

1703
01:47:27,986 --> 01:47:30,420
每天我都会采来好看的花
Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers

1704
01:47:30,490 --> 01:47:34,051
放在她的房间里
and put them in her room for her,

1705
01:47:34,127 --> 01:47:37,563
而她给了我人所能得到的最好的礼物
and she gave me the best gift anyone could ever get

1706
01:47:37,631 --> 01:47:39,064
在整个世界里
in the wide world.

1707
01:47:39,133 --> 01:47:41,658
这是最适合跑步的
They're made just for running.

1708
01:47:41,736 --> 01:47:42,998
“带我回家见亲朋”
# Carry me home to see my kin #

1709
01:47:45,674 --> 01:47:48,199
他还教我如何跳舞
And she even showed me how to dance.

1710
01:47:50,046 --> 01:47:52,412
“我又想起老朋友”
#I miss ol'Bammy once again #

1711
01:47:52,481 --> 01:47:53,709
“我不再对他不起”
#And I think it's a sin #

1712
01:47:54,985 --> 01:47:56,646
“亚拉巴马我的家…”
# Sweet home Alabama... #

1713
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:01,748
我们就象一家人 珍妮和我…
Well, we was like family, Jenny and me...

1714
01:48:04,662 --> 01:48:07,859
那是我一生最快乐的时光
and it was the happiest time in my life.

1715
01:48:32,061 --> 01:48:33,494
你看还要看吗？
You done watching it?

1716
01:48:34,564 --> 01:48:36,555
我要去睡了
I'm going to bed.

1717
01:48:47,447 --> 01:48:49,005
你能嫁给我吗？
Will you marry me?

1718
01:48:54,056 --> 01:48:57,025
我会做个好丈夫的 珍妮
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1719
01:48:59,561 --> 01:49:01,461
你会的 福雷斯
You would, Forrest.

1720
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:05,663
但你不能嫁给我
But you won't marry me.

1721
01:49:08,072 --> 01:49:10,472
你不愿意嫁给我
You don't want to marry me.

1722
01:49:13,578 --> 01:49:15,978
你为什么不爱我 珍妮？
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1723
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:23,354
我不是很聪明
I'm not a smart man,

1724
01:49:23,422 --> 01:49:27,882
但我知道什么是爱
but I know what love is.

1725
01:50:04,804 --> 01:50:06,066
珍妮…
Jenny...

1726
01:50:08,142 --> 01:50:10,440
福雷斯 我真的爱你
Forrest, I do love you.

1727
01:51:03,472 --> 01:51:06,066
那你为什么要跑？
Where are you running off to?

1728
01:51:06,143 --> 01:51:07,701
我没有跑
I'm not running.

1729
01:52:38,135 --> 01:52:40,103
那一天
That day,

1730
01:52:40,170 --> 01:52:41,603
不知什么原因
for no particular reason,

1731
01:52:41,672 --> 01:52:44,664
我决定出去跑一趟
I decided to go for a little run.

1732
01:52:44,741 --> 01:52:48,199
所以我跑到路的尽头
So I ran to the end of the road,

1733
01:52:48,279 --> 01:52:51,612
当我到达那里 我想也许我能跑到城边
and when I got there, I thought maybe I'd run to the end of town.

1734
01:52:51,683 --> 01:52:54,311
卡特总统因中暑病倒…
President Carter, suffering from heat exhaustion...

1735
01:52:54,385 --> 01:52:56,376
而当我到达那里
And when I got there,

1736
01:52:56,454 --> 01:53:00,390
我想也许我能跑遍绿茵县
I thought maybe I'd just run across Greenbow County.

1737
01:53:00,459 --> 01:53:02,893
这时我想既然我跑了那么远
Now, I figured since I'd run this far,

1738
01:53:02,961 --> 01:53:06,829
也许我可以跑遍亚拉巴马州
maybe I'd just run across the great state of Alabama.

1739
01:53:06,899 --> 01:53:08,833
我就这么做了
And that's what I did.

1740
01:53:08,902 --> 01:53:10,893
我横越整个亚拉巴马
I ran clear across Alabama.

1741
01:53:10,970 --> 01:53:15,498
不知什么原因 我继续跑
No particular reason. I just kept on going.

1742
01:53:15,575 --> 01:53:17,509
我一直跑到大海
I ran clear to the ocean.

1743
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:24,342
当我到达那里
And when I got there,

1744
01:53:24,418 --> 01:53:26,852
我想既然我跑了那么远
I figured since I'd gone this far,

1745
01:53:26,921 --> 01:53:30,084
也许不如掉头继续跑
might as well turn around, just keep on going.

1746
01:53:32,127 --> 01:53:35,187
然后当我跑到另一个大海
And when I got to another ocean,

1747
01:53:35,263 --> 01:53:38,198
我想既然我跑了那么远…
I figured since I'd gone this far...

1748
01:53:40,103 --> 01:53:42,401
我也许不如掉头
I might as well just turn back

1749
01:53:42,472 --> 01:53:44,064
继续跑下去
and keep right on going.

1750
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:47,473
当我累了 我就睡觉
when I got tired, I slept.

1751
01:53:47,544 --> 01:53:49,637
当我饿了 我就吃饭
when I got hungry, I ate.

1752
01:53:49,713 --> 01:53:52,147
当我想去…
When I had to go...

1753
01:53:52,216 --> 01:53:53,240
你知道…
you know...

1754
01:53:54,385 --> 01:53:55,545
我就去
I went.

1755
01:53:55,619 --> 01:53:56,813
所以…
And so...

1756
01:53:56,888 --> 01:53:58,913
你不停地跑?
you just ran?

1757
01:54:00,558 --> 01:54:02,116
对
Yeah.

1758
01:54:02,193 --> 01:54:05,890
“看着路在车轮下延伸”
# Lookin' out at the road rushin' under my wheels #

1759
01:54:09,068 --> 01:54:11,935
“看着一年年时光飞逝”
# Lookin' back at the years gone by #

1760
01:54:12,004 --> 01:54:14,302
“就象一片片夏日农田”
# Like so many summer fields #

1761
01:54:15,909 --> 01:54:19,140
“六五年那时我十七岁”
# In '65, I was 17 #

1762
01:54:19,212 --> 01:54:21,646
“我在一刻不停地奔跑”
# And runnin' up one on one #

1763
01:54:23,083 --> 01:54:25,677
“我不知道跑到了何处”
# I don't know where I'm runnin' now #

1764
01:54:25,753 --> 01:54:28,847
“我只是在不停地奔跑”
# I'm just runnin' on #

1765
01:54:28,923 --> 01:54:30,686
“奔跑”
# Runnin' on #

1766
01:54:30,758 --> 01:54:32,692
“无缘无故地奔跑”
# Runnin' on empty #

1767
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:34,159
“奔跑”
# Runnin' on #

1768
01:54:34,228 --> 01:54:36,025
“精疲力竭”
# Runnin' dry #

1769
01:54:36,098 --> 01:54:37,030
“奔跑…”
# Runnin' on... #

1770
01:54:37,099 --> 01:54:38,691
我想了很多事…
I'd think a lot...

1771
01:54:38,767 --> 01:54:43,033
关于妈妈和布巴还有丹中尉
about Mama and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.

1772
01:54:43,105 --> 01:54:44,629
但最经常的
But most of all,

1773
01:54:44,706 --> 01:54:46,697
我在想念珍妮
I thought about Jenny.

1774
01:54:46,776 --> 01:54:49,540
我非常想念她
I thought about her a lot.

1775
01:54:51,014 --> 01:54:52,606
两年多来
For more than two years,

1776
01:54:52,682 --> 01:54:54,411
一位名叫福雷斯甘的人
a man named Forrest Gump,

1777
01:54:54,484 --> 01:54:57,476
来自亚拉巴马绿茵县的园艺师 除了睡觉

1782
01:55:05,063 --> 01:55:07,497

1784
01:55:10,402 --> 01:55:11,835
天那 福雷斯？
I'll be damned. Forrest?

1785
01:55:11,903 --> 01:55:13,837
先生 你为什么要跑？
Sir, where are you running?

1786
01:55:13,905 --> 01:55:16,339
你是为了世界和平吗？
Are you doing this for world peace?

1787
01:55:16,409 --> 01:55:18,843
你是为了无家可者吗？
Are you doing this for the homeless?

1788
01:55:18,911 --> 01:55:20,845
你是为了妇女权利吗？

为了保护环境吗？

1790
01:55:21,914 --> 01:55:23,176
他们就是不相信
they just couldn't believe

1791
01:55:23,249 --> 01:55:25,683
有些人跑步
that Somebody would do all that running

1792
01:55:25,752 --> 01:55:27,185
什么都不为
for no particular reason.

1793
01:55:27,254 --> 01:55:28,846
你为什么这样做？
Why are you doing this?

1794
01:55:28,922 --> 01:55:31,186
我只是想跑
I just felt like running.

1795
01:55:31,258 --> 01:55:32,885
我只是想跑
I just felt like runnin'.

1796
01:55:33,962 --> 01:55:34,894
是你

1797
01:55:34,963 --> 01:55:37,557
我不敢相信真的是你
I can't believe it's really you.

1798
01:55:37,632 --> 01:55:39,065
然后…不知什么原因
Now...for some reason,

1799
01:55:39,133 --> 01:55:41,567
我所做的事好象
what I was doing seemed to...

1800
01:55:41,636 --> 01:55:43,160
在某些人看来有了意义
make sense to people.

1801
01:55:43,238 --> 01:55:46,173
我的头脑中好象响起一声警报
It was like an alarm went off in my head.

1802
01:55:46,242 --> 01:55:49,268
我说 “他是个实干家 
I said, "Here's a guy that's got his act together.

1803
01:55:49,345 --> 01:55:51,279
他拥有所有问题的答案”
Here's somebody who has the answer."

1804
01:55:51,347 --> 01:55:53,281
我要追随你 甘先生
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.

1805
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:55,682
于是我有了伙伴
So I got company.

1806
01:55:57,220 --> 01:55:59,780
然后 我有了更多的伙伴
And after that, I got more company.

1807
01:55:59,856 --> 01:56:03,383
然后 又有更多的人加入
And then, even more people joined in.

1808
01:56:05,396 --> 01:56:07,077
有人后来告诉我
Somebody later told me

1809
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:08,768
人们看到了希望
it gave people hope.

1810
01:56:10,347 --> 01:56:11,507
那时…
Now...

1811
01:56:11,581 --> 01:56:14,072
那时我什么也不知道
Now, I don't know anything about that,

1812
01:56:14,151 --> 01:56:16,585
有些人曾经问我
but some of those people asked me

1813
01:56:16,654 --> 01:56:18,588
我能不能帮助他们
if I could help them out.

1814
01:56:18,656 --> 01:56:21,090
我想你也许能够帮助我
I was wondering if you might help me.

1815
01:56:21,158 --> 01:56:23,092
我是做贴纸生意的
I'm in the bumper sticker business.

1816
01:56:23,161 --> 01:56:24,753
我需要一句好的口号
I need a good slogan,

1817
01:56:24,830 --> 01:56:26,764
你很有天才
and since you've been so inspirational,

1818
01:56:26,832 --> 01:56:29,426
我想你也许能帮助我…
I thought you might be able to help me...

1819
01:56:29,501 --> 01:56:31,264
啊！你刚跑过…
Whoa, man! You just ran

1820
01:56:31,336 --> 01:56:33,634
一大堆狗屎！
through a big pile of dog shit!

1821
01:56:34,874 --> 01:56:36,466
不管它
It happens.

1822
01:56:36,542 --> 01:56:37,907
什么 狗屎？
What, shit?

1823
01:56:38,978 --> 01:56:40,275
有时
Sometimes.

1824
01:56:42,716 --> 01:56:45,184
几年后 我听说那个家伙
And some years later, I heard that that fella

1825
01:56:45,252 --> 01:56:47,516
想出来一条贴纸口号
did come up with a bumper sticker slogan

1826
01:56:47,588 --> 01:56:50,853
赚了一大笔钱
and made a lot of money off of it.

1827
01:56:50,924 --> 01:56:52,858
还有一次 我一个人跑着
Another time, I was running along.

1828
01:56:52,927 --> 01:56:55,862
遇到个卖T恤衫赔了本的人
Somebody who'd lost all his money in the T-shirt business,

1829
01:56:55,930 --> 01:56:59,366
他希望把我的脸印在T恤衫上
he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,

1830
01:56:59,434 --> 01:57:01,368
但他不太会画画
but he couldn't draw that well,

1831
01:57:01,436 --> 01:57:03,370
他也没带照相机
and he didn't have a camera.

1832
01:57:03,439 --> 01:57:06,875
用这个吧 反正没人喜欢这颜色
Here, use this one. Nobody likes that color anyway.

1833
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:13,080
祝你过得好
Have a nice day.

1834
01:57:14,684 --> 01:57:16,618
几年后 我听说
Someyears later, I found out

1835
01:57:16,686 --> 01:57:20,122
那个人确实想出了一个T恤图案
that that man did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.

1836
01:57:20,190 --> 01:57:22,351
赚了一大笔钱
He made a lot of money.

1837
01:57:24,695 --> 01:57:26,629
总之 就象我说过的
Anyway, like I was saying,

1838
01:57:26,697 --> 01:57:29,632
我有了很多伙伴
I had a lot of company.

1839
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:31,133
我妈妈总是说
My mama always said,

1840
01:57:31,203 --> 01:57:34,138
“你得丢开以往的事
"You got to put the past behind you

1841
01:57:34,206 --> 01:57:36,640
“才能不断继续前进”
before you can move on. "

1842
01:57:36,708 --> 01:57:40,644
我想那就是我这次跑步的意义了
And I think that's what my running was all about.

1843
01:57:42,048 --> 01:57:44,642
我跑了三年…
I had run for three years...

1844
01:57:44,717 --> 01:57:46,651
两个月…
two months....

1845
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:48,812
14天又16小时
14 days, and 16 hours.

1846
01:58:04,005 --> 01:58:06,496
安静 安静。他有话要说
Quiet. Quiet. He's going to say something.

1847
01:58:18,020 --> 01:58:20,045
我很累了
I'm pretty tired.

1848
01:58:22,693 --> 01:58:24,786
现在我想回家了
Think I'll go home now .

1849
01:58:42,715 --> 01:58:45,309
那我们该怎么办？
Now what are we supposed to do?

1850
01:58:46,552 --> 01:58:48,144
就这样…
And just like that...

1851
01:58:49,489 --> 01:58:51,423
我跑步的日子结束了
my runnin' days was over.

1852
01:58:52,826 --> 01:58:55,158
我回到亚拉巴马的家
So I went home to Alabama.

1853
01:58:55,362 --> 01:58:57,592
不久前 下午2时25分
Moments ago, at 2:25 P.M.,

1854
01:58:57,664 --> 01:59:00,098
当里根总统走出…
as President Reagan was leaving the...

1855
01:59:02,003 --> 01:59:03,937
开了五至六枪
Five or six gunshots were fired

1856
01:59:04,005 --> 01:59:05,939
一个不知名的凶手
by an unknown, would-be assassin.

1857
01:59:06,007 --> 01:59:08,441
总统胸部中弹…
The president was shot in the chest...

1858
01:59:08,509 --> 01:59:10,101
我拿到邮件
I picked up the mail.

1859
01:59:10,179 --> 01:59:12,773
有一天 天气晴朗
And one day, out of the blue clear sky,

1860
01:59:12,848 --> 01:59:15,043
我收到一封珍妮的来信
I got a letter from Jenny

1861
01:59:15,117 --> 01:59:17,551
问我能不能来萨凡纳
wondering if I could come down to Savannah

1862
01:59:17,619 --> 01:59:21,055
来看她 所以我就来了
and see her, and that's what I'm doing here.

1863
01:59:22,125 --> 01:59:24,559
她在电视上看到我…跑步
She saw me on TV... running.

1864
01:59:24,627 --> 01:59:29,121
我正要乘9路车去里奇蒙街
I'm supposed to go on the number 9 bus to Richmond Street

1865
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:32,135
然后下车向左走
and get off and go one block left

1866
01:59:32,203 --> 01:59:34,637
到亨利街1947号…

4单元
apartment 4.

1868
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:39,635
那你不必乘公交车
Why, you don't need to take a bus.

1869
01:59:39,711 --> 01:59:43,647
亨利街离这儿只有五六个街区…
Henry Street is just five or six blocks...

1870
01:59:43,715 --> 01:59:45,649
就往那边

1871
01:59:45,717 --> 01:59:47,150
往那边？
Down that way?

1872
01:59:47,219 --> 01:59:48,652

Down that way .

1873

1882

Susan.

1963
02:06:21,711 --> 02:06:24,271
丹中尉
Lieutenant Dan.

1964
02:06:24,347 --> 02:06:26,440
嗨 福雷斯
Hi, Forrest.

1965
02:06:26,516 --> 02:06:28,984
丹中尉…
Lieutenant Dan...

1966
02:06:29,053 --> 02:06:30,645
这位是我的珍妮
this is my Jenny.

1967
02:06:30,721 --> 02:06:33,986
很高兴能见到你
Hi. It's nice to meet you finally.

1968
02:06:44,269 --> 02:06:46,829
福雷斯 你愿意让珍妮
Do you, Forrest, take Jenny

1969
02:06:46,905 --> 02:06:48,372
做你的妻子吗？
to be your wife?

1970
02:06:50,176 --> 02:06:52,610
珍妮 你愿意让福雷斯
Do you, Jenny, take Forrest

1971
02:06:52,679 --> 02:06:54,271
做你的丈夫吗？
to be your husband?

1972
02:06:55,849 --> 02:06:59,307
那么我宣布你们结为夫妻
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

1973
02:07:45,403 --> 02:07:46,802
嘿 福雷斯…
Hey, Forrest...

1974
02:07:52,177 --> 02:07:54,668
你在越南害怕过吗？
were you scared in Vietnam?

1975
02:07:56,016 --> 02:07:57,779
是的
Yes.

1976
02:07:57,851 --> 02:07:59,443
我…
Well, I...

1977
02:07:59,519 --> 02:08:01,646
我不知道
I don't know.

1978
02:08:01,721 --> 02:08:03,780
当雨停的时候
Sometimes it would stop raining

1979
02:08:03,857 --> 02:08:07,258
有时能看到星星…
long enough for the stars to come out...

1980
02:08:10,197 --> 02:08:12,131
那感觉很好
and then it was nice.

1981
02:08:15,404 --> 02:08:18,464
就象太阳下山前
It was like just before the sun goes to bed

1982
02:08:18,540 --> 02:08:19,939
在拉巴特湾
down on the bayou.

1983
02:08:20,008 --> 02:08:24,741
海面的闪闪鳞光…
there was always a million sparkles on the water...

1984
02:08:26,549 --> 02:08:28,676
就象山间的湖水
like that mountain lake.

1985
02:08:28,751 --> 02:08:30,685
那样的清澈 珍妮
It was so clear, Jenny,

1986
02:08:30,753 --> 02:08:33,688
就象另一片天空
it looked like there were two skies

1987
02:08:33,756 --> 02:08:35,690
两重天空
one on top of the other.

1988
02:08:37,394 --> 02:08:40,761
还有在沙漠里 当太阳升起…
And then in the desert, when the sun comes up...

1989
02:08:43,233 --> 02:08:44,666
我分不清
I couldn't tell

1990
02:08:44,736 --> 02:08:50,538
哪儿是天 哪儿是地
where heaven stopped and the earth began.

1991
02:08:51,843 --> 02:08:54,004
真是美丽
It's so beautiful.

1992
02:08:58,084 --> 02:09:01,110
我但愿那时和你在一起
I wish I could've been there with you.

1993
02:09:04,358 --> 02:09:06,349
你确实在的
You were.

1994
02:09:16,604 --> 02:09:18,299
我爱你
I love you.

1995
02:09:22,377 --> 02:09:25,505
你在星期六清晨死去
You died on a Saturday morning.

1996
02:09:27,383 --> 02:09:31,479
我把你葬在我们的树下
And I had you placed here under our tree.

1997
02:09:35,892 --> 02:09:39,328
我把你父亲的房子
And I had that house of your father's

1998
02:09:39,396 --> 02:09:41,660
推成了平地
bulldozed to the ground.

1999
02:09:44,902 --> 02:09:46,096
妈妈…
Mama...

2000
02:09:47,238 --> 02:09:49,172
总是说…
always said

2001
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:53,336
死亡是生命的一部分
that dyin' was a part of life .

2002
02:09:55,914 --> 02:09:57,677
我真的希望不是这样
I sure wish it wasn't.

2003
02:10:01,086 --> 02:10:02,610
小福雷斯…
Little Forrest is...

2004
02:10:03,923 --> 02:10:06,187
很好
doing just fine.

2005
02:10:06,259 --> 02:10:07,248
“不过…”
"But..."

2006
02:10:07,326 --> 02:10:09,760
就要去上学了
About to start school again so on,

2007
02:10:09,829 --> 02:10:11,854
还有…
and...

2008
02:10:11,931 --> 02:10:15,196
我给他做早餐、午餐和晚餐
and I make his breakfast, lunch, and dinner

2009
02:10:15,269 --> 02:10:16,327
每天
every day.

2010
02:10:18,105 --> 02:10:19,697
我让他…
I make sure he...

2011
02:10:21,108 --> 02:10:22,541
梳头
combs his hair

2012
02:10:22,610 --> 02:10:24,703
让他每天刷牙
and brushes his teeth every day.

2013
02:10:26,948 --> 02:10:29,508
教他怎么打乒乓球
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

2014
02:10:31,787 --> 02:10:33,220
他打得很棒
He's really good.

2015
02:10:33,289 --> 02:10:35,382
福雷斯 你来发球
Uh, Forrest, you go.

2016
02:10:39,962 --> 02:10:41,395
我们经常钓鱼
We fish a lot.

2017
02:10:44,801 --> 02:10:47,167
我们每天晚上读书
And every night, we read a book.

2018
02:10:47,237 --> 02:10:48,670
他聪明极了 珍妮
He's so smart, Jenny.

2019
02:10:51,742 --> 02:10:53,835
你一定会为他骄傲
You'd be so proud of him.

2020
02:10:55,580 --> 02:10:56,842
我会的
I am.

2021
02:10:58,249 --> 02:11:01,412
他还给你写了封信
He, uh, wrote you a...a letter.

2022
02:11:02,754 --> 02:11:05,689
他说不许我看 我不能看
And he says I can't read it. I'm not supposed to,

2023
02:11:05,757 --> 02:11:08,692
所以我把它放在这儿给你
so I'll just leave it here for you.

2024
02:11:24,945 --> 02:11:26,846
珍妮…
Jenny...

2025
02:11:31,752 --> 02:11:34,687
我不知道是妈妈对
I don't know if Mama was right

2026
02:11:34,755 --> 02:11:37,849
还是丹中尉对
or if it...it's Lieutenant Dan.

2027
02:11:37,924 --> 02:11:39,789
我不知道
I don't know...

2028
02:11:40,928 --> 02:11:43,590
是否我们每个人都有
if we each have a...

2029
02:11:44,766 --> 02:11:45,892
注定的命运…
destiny...

2030
02:11:47,368 --> 02:11:51,134
还是我们的生命中只有偶然
or if we're all just floating around accidental-like

2031
02:11:51,206 --> 02:11:52,639
象在风中飘…
on a breeze...

2032
02:11:56,879 --> 02:11:58,813
但我想…
but I...I think...

2033
02:12:00,717 --> 02:12:02,480
也许两者都有吧
maybe it's both.

2034
02:12:06,723 --> 02:12:09,954
也许两者都在同时发生着
Maybe both get happening at the same time.

2035
02:12:15,733 --> 02:12:17,667
可是我想念你 珍妮
But I miss you, Jenny.

2036
02:12:24,242 --> 02:12:26,233
如果你想要什么…
If there's anything you need...

2037
02:12:27,412 --> 02:12:29,346
我就在你身边
I won't be far away.

2038
02:13:03,719 --> 02:13:06,153
你的车来了
Here's your bus.

2039
02:13:06,222 --> 02:13:07,587
好吧
O.K.

2040
02:13:07,656 --> 02:13:10,147
嗨…
Hey...

2041
02:13:10,227 --> 02:13:11,660
我知道
I know this.

2042
02:13:11,728 --> 02:13:14,162
我会在故事会上讲故事
I'm gonna share that for show-and-tell

2043
02:13:14,231 --> 02:13:17,394
因为奶奶曾给你读过
because Grandma used to read it to you.

2044
02:13:17,467 --> 02:13:19,526
我最喜欢的书
My favorite book.

2045
02:13:23,007 --> 02:13:24,440
好了
Here we are.

2046
02:13:24,508 --> 02:13:25,839
嘿…
Hey...

2047
02:13:27,746 --> 02:13:29,179
你该走了
here you go.

2048
02:13:34,353 --> 02:13:35,911
嘿 福雷斯…
Hey, Forrest...

2049
02:13:35,988 --> 02:13:37,455
不要…
don't...

2050
02:13:40,260 --> 02:13:42,785
我想告诉你我爱你
I want to tell you I love you.

2051
02:13:42,862 --> 02:13:44,830
我也爱你 爸爸
I love you, too, Daddy.

2052
02:13:44,898 --> 02:13:47,765
我就在这儿等你回来
I'll be right here when you get back.

2053
02:13:53,207 --> 02:13:56,643
你知道这是校车 是吧？
You understand this is the bus to school, now, don't you?

2054
02:13:56,711 --> 02:14:00,477
当然 你是多萝西哈里斯 我是福雷斯甘
Of course, and you're Dorothy Harris, and I'm Forrest Gump.
