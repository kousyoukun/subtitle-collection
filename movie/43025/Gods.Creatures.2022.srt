1
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:39,899
（狗吠叫）

2
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:57,356
弗朗西:漫長的一天。

3
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:01,162
（吠叫繼續
在遠處）

4
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:23,844
（模糊的喋喋不休）

5
00:03:11,828 --> 00:03:12,860
愛琳？

6
00:03:14,336 --> 00:03:15,368
謝謝,愛。

7
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,275
莎拉:更像
驢子闖進來了,瑪麗。

8
00:03:21,277 --> 00:03:24,542
他媽的,喜歡,
我們本來可以是任何東西。

9
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:29,481
教師,護士,理髮師。

10
00:03:29,483 --> 00:03:34,244
（笑）理髮師？
不要那麼雄心勃勃,莎拉。

11
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:37,885
你不只是聽到她的聲音嗎？
叫我們驢子？
實際的屁股,喜歡。

12
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:40,426
-但是真是個屁,希拉,女孩。
-（笑聲）

13
00:03:42,397 --> 00:03:44,628
（警笛哀嚎）

14
00:03:48,502 --> 00:03:50,095
（模糊的喊叫）

15
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:00,413
瑪麗: 我的兒子！（抽泣）

16
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,415
不！

17
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:05,616
不！

18
00:04:05,618 --> 00:04:08,784
馬克！（歇斯底裡地哭泣）

19
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,696
（瑪麗輕輕地哭泣）

20
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:55,094
（莎拉用蓋爾語唱歌）

21
00:05:52,054 --> 00:05:55,462
如果我什麼都不做,
我正在教這個小屁孩
如何游泳。

22
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:56,694
莎拉:愛琳。

23
00:05:56,696 --> 00:05:58,355
耶穌基督,姑娘。

24
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,225
耶拉...

25
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,161
為了他媽的緣故。
他們真的生活在水面上

26
00:06:02,163 --> 00:06:03,470
他們都沒有學會如何做。

27
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:05,395
你知道的
這是傳統,愛琳。

28
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:08,068
什麼,知道是運氣不好？

29
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,072
如果他們不會游泳,
他們不會跳進去
並説明其他人。

30
00:06:12,074 --> 00:06:14,976
一群自私的流氓,
太擔心了
關於他們自己的皮膚。

31
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:17,242
-（奧斯卡咕咕）
-怎麼了,奧斯卡,愛情？

32
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:21,114
醒來哭泣三,
每晚四次。

33
00:06:21,116 --> 00:06:24,084
-災難,就像。
-耶穌基督,
我記得和你在一起的夜晚。

34
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:25,789
永遠睡不著。

35
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,253
騙子告訴我
我只能讓你哭。

36
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,419
我該怎麼做？

37
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:32,499
- 聽到每一個噪音。
-（咕咕）

38
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:34,633
你是更容易的孩子,
公平地說。

39
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,775
（咕咕）

40
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:50,308
（用蓋爾語演唱）

41
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:11,032
（模糊的喋喋不休）

42
00:07:11,034 --> 00:07:13,232
布萊恩:進展如何？
我有一段時間沒見你了。

43
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:14,266
事情怎麼樣？

44
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,840
很高興見到你。（笑）

45
00:07:16,842 --> 00:07:18,369
（笑聲）

46
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,678
嗨,丹。

47
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,339
布萊恩·奧哈拉？管他呢
你在這裡嗎？

48
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:22,813
耶穌基督,你的大小。

49
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:24,243
你越強壯...
過來這裡。

50
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:26,179
布萊恩:我們都更廣泛了
更聰明的是丹男孩的樣子。

51
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:28,489
-過了一會兒。
-好傢伙,事情怎麼樣？

52
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:33,725
布萊恩。

53
00:07:34,794 --> 00:07:37,256
-基督,布萊恩
-（笑）

54
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:44,901
媽媽,看看你,呵呵。

55
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:47,838
-你的頭髮。
你一點也沒變。
-（哭泣）

56
00:07:48,643 --> 00:07:49,873
（奧斯卡哭泣）

57
00:07:51,613 --> 00:07:52,876
布萊恩:這是誰,對吧？

58
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:55,714
這是我的寶貝弟弟,是嗎？

59
00:07:55,716 --> 00:07:57,881
什麼！不不不。
上帝啊。（笑）

60
00:07:57,883 --> 00:07:59,245
哦,來找我。

61
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:01,654
哦。（氣喘吁吁）

62
00:08:01,656 --> 00:08:03,150
嗯,帕迪,事情怎麼樣？

63
00:08:03,152 --> 00:08:05,185
愛琳:你是個婊子養的兒子。

64
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:07,319
-布萊恩！
-布萊恩:愛琳！

65
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,519
搞什麼！
你在這裡幹什麼？

66
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:11,290
現在是「回合時間」
我回來了,不是嗎？

67
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:12,324
（歎息）

68
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:15,833
- 布萊恩:莎拉。
-布萊恩。

69
00:08:15,835 --> 00:08:18,638
愛琳:馬克·菲茨需要死
等你回來
對我們來說,是嗎？

70
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:20,332
什麼？

71
00:08:22,237 --> 00:08:23,577
這就是為誰準備的？

72
00:08:24,811 --> 00:08:26,437
啊,他媽的我,是的。

73
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:29,946
我很抱歉。

74
00:08:34,018 --> 00:08:35,556
只要給我一秒鐘。

75
00:08:37,923 --> 00:08:39,087
瑪麗,嗯...

76
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:42,695
我很抱歉,瑪麗。

77
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:44,697
-我很抱歉。
-瑪麗:謝謝。

78
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,944
帕迪多久了
一直都是這樣的？

79
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,014
好幾年了
在此階段。

80
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:09,249
-回來一定很奇怪。
-嗯。

81
00:09:09,251 --> 00:09:11,020
可能一模一樣,
但是,是嗎？

82
00:09:11,022 --> 00:09:13,220
（布萊恩和愛琳笑）

83
00:09:13,222 --> 00:09:15,189
布萊恩:她會停止去嗎？

84
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:17,895
愛琳:哦,不是一秒鐘
你一直都在走。

85
00:09:17,897 --> 00:09:19,699
（奧斯卡哭泣）

86
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:21,932
愛琳:一分鐘,愛。

87
00:09:24,332 --> 00:09:26,266
（車輛接近）

88
00:09:29,271 --> 00:09:31,601
布萊恩:那個爸爸,是嗎？

89
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:34,472
你應該出去見見他。
他喜歡這樣。

90
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,441
繼續。

91
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:53,227
-你好嗎？
-哦,是的,是的。

92
00:09:56,969 --> 00:09:58,298
（模糊的喋喋不休）

93
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,674
愛琳:看到他們很奇怪
握手。

94
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:04,172
（愛琳歎息）他是不同的,
不是嗎？成長為自己。

95
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:05,976
你估計嗎？

96
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,408
愛琳:一位母親知道。

97
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,014
（腳步聲接近）

98
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:19,616
你臉上的表情。

99
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:23,125
-別那麼震驚,夥計。
-什麼？

100
00:10:24,964 --> 00:10:27,459
-缺點:她喂過你嗎？
- 布萊恩:呃,不。還沒有。

101
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:31,771
缺點:難以置信
他回家了,對吧？

102
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:35,368
很高興現在回家,好吧。

103
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:41,308
所以,你在澳大利亞。

104
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,509
未取得聯繫
和我們在一起多久？

105
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:48,150
你會得到一個概念,
突然間,回家了。

106
00:10:48,152 --> 00:10:52,858
狗屎天氣,他媽的所有工作,
而不告訴任何人？

107
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,763
是的。那是關於
它的大小,是的。

108
00:10:56,765 --> 00:10:59,062
來吧,你為什麼回來了,喜歡？

109
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,362
呃。。。

110
00:11:03,332 --> 00:11:04,364
稻田的牡蠣。

111
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,371
基督。哦,你開始了
從無到有。
你省錢了嗎？

112
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:15,012
牡蠣需要工作。
它們並不便宜。

113
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:18,543
但我們仍然有
它的許可證。

114
00:11:19,854 --> 00:11:21,249
我保留了付款。

115
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:25,319
每年
因為Con放棄了它。

116
00:11:27,422 --> 00:11:28,586
以防萬一。

117
00:11:33,461 --> 00:11:35,098
（嗡嗡聲）

118
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,612
（伴有咕嚕聲）

119
00:11:57,023 --> 00:12:00,453
-向前傾斜。
-好的。

120
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:04,160
-布萊恩:是這樣嗎？
-是的。

121
00:12:04,162 --> 00:12:05,722
-布萊恩:那好嗎？
-是的。

122
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:15,165
布萊恩: 我明白了
你照顧它。

123
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,663
缺點:我的父親
再也無法忍受了,

124
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:23,107
你走了
並一直不復存在。

125
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:25,175
就是這樣。沒有其他選擇。

126
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:28,915
不想工作它
與其他人一起。

127
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,887
耶穌基督,這是不真實的。

128
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:36,021
缺點:地面的
部分有點軟。

129
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,188
您必須更換
你的一些棧橋。

130
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,388
查找供應商
為您的牡蠣和袋子。

131
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,853
從種子開始
或者半個成年人,然後。

132
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:47,329
至少一年
在它們成熟之前,轉為利潤。

133
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:48,968
你必須找到
另一筆收入。

134
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:53,236
但你自己也知道這一點。

135
00:13:53,238 --> 00:13:56,107
那不算什麼
你無法管理,
不過,布萊恩。是嗎？

136
00:13:56,109 --> 00:13:58,538
不麻煩。
為了他媽的緣故。（笑）

137
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:48,885
（叮叮噹噹）

138
00:14:50,922 --> 00:14:54,066
哦,對不起,愛琳。
忘了打卡了。

139
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:57,036
-給我一分鐘時間。
-不著急,愛。

140
00:15:12,614 --> 00:15:16,055
布萊恩:好看的牡蠣。
謝謝弗朗西

141
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,552
如果他們抓住了我們,那就有點瘋狂了。

142
00:15:18,554 --> 00:15:20,521
-愛琳:哦,
不要對我說。
-（笑）

143
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,063
快點吧,你會的。加油。

144
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:25,427
我在等媽。

145
00:15:28,465 --> 00:15:29,629
（咕嚕咕嚕）

146
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,864
-晚餐見,是嗎？
-去吧,是的,走開。

147
00:15:43,018 --> 00:15:44,050
注意安全。

148
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,704
-布萊恩:啪！
-（熱鬧的愛爾蘭音樂播放）

149
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:48,543
（愛琳·百靈）

150
00:16:57,048 --> 00:16:58,586
（歡呼）

151
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,631
布萊恩:謝謝你們,夥計們。

152
00:17:16,342 --> 00:17:17,902
嗨,小夥子,事情怎麼樣？

153
00:17:21,611 --> 00:17:22,775
丹:你來了。

154
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,582
在這裡,採取一些這樣的措施。繼續。

155
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:29,386
弗朗西:週刊。給我們一首歌。

156
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:31,080
-走吧。
-謝謝,媽媽。

157
00:17:31,082 --> 00:17:32,983
-你去吧,丹。
-莎拉:好的,好的。
我會為你做一個。

他媽的,法蘭西。

204
00:20:07,678 --> 00:20:09,513
沒有
附近有足夠多的袋子。

205
00:20:09,515 --> 00:20:11,207
其餘的在哪裡
我他媽的半個成年人？

206
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:13,880
我相信他們都在那裡。
你把它們填好了,
不是嗎？

207
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:15,420
無法想像
我怎麼可能沒有。

208
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,686
我以完全相同的方式拆分它們
就像我上次做的那樣,喜歡。

209
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:21,052
因為你是個白癡,
這就是原因。鄧尼斯在這裡嗎？

210
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,724
愛琳:我沒有
看到他了嗎,沒有。

211
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:32,272
這是一個容易犯的錯誤,
女孩。快點走吧。

212
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:36,474

213

不是嗎？

214
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,164
羞辱你和法蘭西
我們不得不早點回家
那天晚上。

215
00:21:10,642 --> 00:21:13,445
我一直在佔用空間,
他不開心
關於它。

216
00:21:16,846 --> 00:21:20,353
擦了擦他的手
在最後一晚之後。

217
00:21:20,355 --> 00:21:23,818
但在這裡,我哭出了我的眼睛
就好像他就是那個人一樣
誰傷了我的心。

218
00:21:26,394 --> 00:21:27,492
不過,忍不住。

219
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,762
慢慢來。

220
00:21:42,938 --> 00:21:45,301
我回來了
在我父母的房子里
住了幾個晚上。

221
00:21:51,617 --> 00:21:54,211
時間不言而喻
很快進入透視。

222
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,360
他的話很殘酷。

223
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,062
不過,他只是
像其他人一樣。

224
00:22:12,671 --> 00:22:14,671
我們都是上帝的受造物
不知情。

225
00:22:37,388 --> 00:22:39,322
（愛琳歎息）

226
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:40,961
（愛琳會說蓋爾語）

227
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:49,068
（喘息）

228
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:48,831
布萊恩:那是四條鮭魚。

229
00:23:58,579 --> 00:23:59,776
兩百給你。

230
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,679
司機:好人。

231
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,720
-布萊恩:謝謝。
-乾杯。

232
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,077
布萊恩:工作進展如何,康？

233
00:24:41,248 --> 00:24:43,655
啊,我想是創造出來的。

234
00:24:44,856 --> 00:24:46,350
這是從哪裡來的？

235
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:58,604
你認為你是
一個硬漢,是嗎？
與系統作鬥爭。

236
00:24:58,606 --> 00:25:00,672
偷獵,
好像你不知道更好。

237
00:25:00,674 --> 00:25:02,971
這不是你沒有做的事
回到過去,騙子。

238
00:25:02,973 --> 00:25:05,468
我從來沒有出去過
在春潮時。

239
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,107
馬可肯定死了
做同樣的事情。

240
00:25:09,045 --> 00:25:12,343
那就是
你會發生什麼
最終,否則你會被抓住。

241
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:15,654
所有指向同一目的,
喜歡。愚蠢。

242
00:25:15,656 --> 00:25:18,085
耶穌基督,輕裝上陣,夥計。

243
00:25:18,087 --> 00:25:21,726
她為你偷的包
還不夠,不是嗎？

244
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:25,323
你持續了多長時間
誠實行事
牡蠣？

245
00:25:25,325 --> 00:25:27,556
反正比我想像的要長。
公平競爭。

246
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:29,635
你一直告訴我
我能做什麼,不能做什麼,

247
00:25:29,637 --> 00:25:32,132
但我保持
帕迪的農場正在走。

248
00:25:32,134 --> 00:25:35,036
你父親只想說
你不必採取
這樣的風險。

249
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,242
謝謝媽。

250
00:25:57,731 --> 00:25:59,599
（水湧出）

251
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,932
（海鷗吱
在遠處）

252
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:53,411
這是怎麼回事,小夥子？

253
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:55,787
檢查是否沒有任何內容
我可以利用。

254
00:26:58,957 --> 00:27:00,693
基督,事情是
那可是壞事吧？

255
00:27:02,158 --> 00:27:03,322
你就像一隻老鼠。

256
00:27:04,963 --> 00:27:06,699
其中大部分是我的舊狗屎。

257
00:27:07,768 --> 00:27:10,329
它早已成為任何用途。

258
00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:12,936
投資一些新事物
為了你自己。

259
00:27:12,938 --> 00:27:14,773
給自己
反正有機會,小夥子。

260
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,173
告訴我們,什麼...
你明天要做什麼？

261
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:21,637
（點擊舌頭）呃。。。

262
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,573
晚上出門
潮汐過後,我會說。

263
00:27:25,313 --> 00:27:26,752
所以,你是自由的
早上,我服用嗎？

264
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:32,186
可以有一份工作給你。

265
00:27:32,188 --> 00:27:35,387
我的意思是,使用這些肯定
我可以付錢給你
上面有點額外。

266
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,733
這很艱難,不是嗎...

267
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,461
自己動手嗎？

268
00:27:45,971 --> 00:27:47,432
實在是太過分了,
一個人。

269
00:27:51,174 --> 00:27:52,536
這是教訓
你父親學會了。

270
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,214
這些將適合布萊恩,
他們會嗎？

271
00:29:15,225 --> 00:29:16,587
你沒事吧,瑪麗？

272
00:29:20,197 --> 00:29:24,199
我一直以為我聽到了馬克
當我獨自一人在這裡時。

273
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,467
晚上有聲音...

274
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,108
可能是他
在這個地方移動。

275
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,311
奇怪的舒適。

276
00:29:42,956 --> 00:29:44,219
（歎息）

277
00:29:57,432 --> 00:29:58,530
謝謝,愛。

278
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,424
（氣喘吁吁）

279
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:03,760
弗朗西:布萊恩,
出來他媽的。
你能快點嗎？

280
00:31:19,954 --> 00:31:20,986
（咕嚕咕嚕）

281
00:31:25,322 --> 00:31:26,453
哦。

282
00:31:27,962 --> 00:31:29,962
-哦。
-（笑）

283
00:31:35,431 --> 00:31:36,969
必須保持警惕
在潮汐上,夥計。

284
00:31:57,387 --> 00:31:58,419
（呻吟）

285
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:25,710
布萊恩:某個早晨,
稻田男孩。

286
00:32:32,587 --> 00:32:34,521
一切都在改變,
但。。。

287
00:32:36,591 --> 00:32:39,493
一模一樣
當你,我,
和騙子在工作。

288
00:32:48,504 --> 00:32:50,834
喝冷茶
從7UP瓶中取出

289
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:52,506
在晴朗的日子里,
沒有比這更好的了。

290
00:33:00,285 --> 00:33:01,548
你在那裡嗎？

291
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:05,651
（輕輕地咕嚕咕嚕）

292
00:33:10,361 --> 00:33:11,591
狗屎...

293
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:15,859
他媽的。。。

294
00:33:18,732 --> 00:33:20,369
迪克,波洛克斯,屁股。

295
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,048
（輕輕咕咕）

296
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,009
你什麼都沒說？

297
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:35,879
愛琳:
我沒有告訴他任何事情,沒有。

298
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,816
九個月後,這個傢伙。

299
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:43,524
他是一個需要説明的小傢伙。

300
00:33:43,526 --> 00:33:47,660
通常的家庭特徵。
男孩就是男孩。

301
00:33:47,662 --> 00:33:49,398
粘在他們母親的奶頭上。

302
00:33:54,339 --> 00:33:55,866
看起來很聰明。

303
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:59,034
你想要嗎
和我們一起下來？

304
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:00,871
愛琳:我應該回家了。

305
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:03,181
我們有一個早期的
在上午。

306
00:34:03,183 --> 00:34:05,975
引領全國
幾天。

307
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,582
顯示小個子
世界還有更多。

308
00:34:08,584 --> 00:34:10,815
布萊恩:來吧。
讓我們來展示一下。

309
00:34:15,294 --> 00:34:16,359
哦。

310
00:34:17,395 --> 00:34:18,790
（咯咯笑）

311
00:34:21,795 --> 00:34:22,827
（門打開）

312
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:25,863
（門關閉）

313
00:34:25,865 --> 00:34:27,271
（笑）

314
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,174
我。。。我不知道。

315
00:34:29,176 --> 00:34:31,770
-聖誕毛衣。
-聖誕毛衣,
就是這個。

316
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,938
好吧,到...

317
00:34:36,216 --> 00:34:38,678
你可以去
在世界任何地方。

318
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,350
無條件。
你會去哪裡？

319
00:34:42,387 --> 00:34:43,584
你知道嗎...

320
00:34:44,884 --> 00:34:49,051
我寧願只是...（歎息）
把歲月捲回來...

321
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,790
然後坐你
和你父親下來
使你們表現得像成年人一樣。

322
00:34:57,468 --> 00:35:01,701
這很好
想像你相處融洽,
住在一個屋簷下。

323
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:11,282
但我為此感到自豪
不過,你現在是。

324
00:35:11,284 --> 00:35:13,779
就好像作品本身
是開始
和它的結束。

325
00:35:15,486 --> 00:35:16,914
莎拉:嘿,丹。

326
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:19,455
- 丹:嘿,莎拉。
-我能買一杯威士忌嗎？

327
00:35:19,457 --> 00:35:20,786
當然可以。是的。

328
00:35:24,154 --> 00:35:25,461
你想再喝一杯嗎？

329
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:29,465
不。不,留在那裡。
我會得到的,好吧。

330
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,473
讓我來告訴你這個。

331
00:35:37,475 --> 00:35:40,410
哦,你很偉大。
不過,謝謝。

332
00:35:47,518 --> 00:35:49,452
你出去過夜？

333
00:35:49,454 --> 00:35:51,179
我們將在這之後看到現在。

334
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:52,224
嗯嗯。

335
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:58,824
我簡直不敢相信
老實說,你還在這裡。

336
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,367
我以為你會有
早就拋棄了這個地方。

337
00:36:05,536 --> 00:36:06,898
我不知道
你為什麼會這麼想。

338
00:36:08,572 --> 00:36:10,473
我需要的一切
在這裡。

339
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,278
不用去
尋找它。

340
00:36:14,644 --> 00:36:15,676
嗯。

341
00:36:19,484 --> 00:36:20,549
比如？

342
00:36:24,654 --> 00:36:27,688
不。我們曾經有過
一起好瘋狂
當我們年輕的時候,不是嗎？

343
00:36:28,724 --> 00:36:30,394
-我們？
-嗯嗯嗯。

344
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,925
那是很久以前的事了。

345
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:37,434
我不會掛在上面
如果我是你。

346
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:42,670
你在喝什麼？

347
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,741
當然,去吧,給我一個驚喜。

348
00:36:52,616 --> 00:36:55,551
我,嗯...兩個又一樣。

349
00:36:55,553 --> 00:36:57,520
-呃,她有
威士卡,是她嗎？
- 和:嗯嗯嗯。

350
00:36:57,522 --> 00:36:59,214
-（叮叮噹噹）
-（模糊的喋喋不休）

351
00:37:01,251 --> 00:37:02,294
布萊恩:你去吧。

352
00:37:04,595 --> 00:37:05,627
有...

353
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,867
退潮時間是什麼時候？

354
00:37:15,573 --> 00:37:16,704
繼續吧,你會嗎？

355
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,839
好吧。晚上,寵物。

356
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:22,039
晚安。

357
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,662
莎拉:我可能會借用
那讓你的頂端
其中一個晚上,愛琳。

358
00:37:42,336 --> 00:37:43,797
愛琳: 我來見你
明天,姑娘。

359
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,552
（烏鴉吱吱叫）

360
00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:26,702
愛琳:對不起,小夥子們。

361
00:39:26,704 --> 00:39:28,099
（模糊的喋喋不休）

362
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:33,841
-早上好。
- 所有:早上好。

363
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:53,960
女人1:
你昨晚出去了嗎？

364
00:39:53,962 --> 00:39:56,765
女人2:不,不。
我不是。你出去了嗎？

365
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,636
（模糊的喋喋不休）

366
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:33,736
晚安,是嗎？

367
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:10,674
女人:瑪麗,看。

368
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:14,469
-看看那個。
-停止皮帶。愛琳。

369
00:41:18,552 --> 00:41:21,080
-真菌。
-狗屎。

370
00:41:24,822 --> 00:41:26,184
女人:我們也有真菌。

371
00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:28,483
鄧尼斯:讓我看看！

372
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,697
-檢查股票的其餘部分。
-（呼吸沉重）

373
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,028
鄧尼斯:把這些扔掉。

374
00:41:36,031 --> 00:41:38,537
他媽的緣故！
真是一場災難。

375
00:41:42,499 --> 00:41:44,070
（繼續呼吸沉重）

376
00:41:47,141 --> 00:41:48,206
女人: 耶穌！

377
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:53,211
-莎拉？
-不要碰我。

378
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,739
巡警西部:
特此警告您

379
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,236
停止種植
所有牡蠣持有量

380
00:42:18,238 --> 00:42:20,073
直至另行通知,

381
00:42:20,075 --> 00:42:24,077
可處以失去許可證
如果被發現違規
暫停。

382
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,685
您今天收穫的任何牡蠣
必須銷毀。

383
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:30,655
（模糊的喋喋不休）

384
00:42:38,863 --> 00:42:40,390
布萊恩: 你有嗎
對我有什麼工作嗎？

385
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:42,964
弗朗西:不,我不會
再次需要你
有一段時間,沒有。

386
00:42:42,966 --> 00:42:45,197
保持低頭
像他們的其餘部分一樣,
你會很宏偉。

387
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:46,803
我會拿走你欠我的,所以。

388
00:42:46,805 --> 00:42:47,936
（法蘭西笑）

389
00:42:51,304 --> 00:42:55,108
弗朗西:好的,小夥子們,
讓我們把它們都扔掉。是的。

390
00:42:57,046 --> 00:42:58,210
（門關閉）

391
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:33,850
（淋浴運行）

392
00:44:00,978 --> 00:44:03,176
-女人1:我們是什麼
現在應該做,喜歡嗎？
-女人2:哦。

393
00:44:03,178 --> 00:44:05,541
女人3:同樣的事情發生了,
大約七八年前,
不是嗎？

394
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:07,345
幾乎被摧毀
牡蠣養殖者。

395
00:44:07,347 --> 00:44:09,754
女人2:他們的想法
在家裡無所事事。
對任何人都沒有好處。

396
00:44:09,756 --> 00:44:12,581
瑪麗:似乎得到了
對她來說越來越糟,
不是嗎？

397
00:44:13,023 --> 00:44:14,319
可憐的克拉圖。

398
00:44:16,928 --> 00:44:18,697
她不是故意要咬你。

399
00:44:20,294 --> 00:44:23,735
如果法蘭西做了什麼,
她需要大聲說出來。

400
00:44:25,101 --> 00:44:26,661
（模糊的喋喋不休）

401
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,490
-愛琳:嘿,愛。
-希亞。

402
00:44:55,494 --> 00:44:57,626
你忙嗎？

403
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:02,334
不是很好的時間,沒有。
我只是在做
房子里有幾份工作。

404
00:45:02,336 --> 00:45:05,172
媽媽說他們沒見過你
在工廠幾天內。

405
00:45:06,846 --> 00:45:08,571
氣味終於來了
找到你,是嗎？

406
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:10,705
不。

407
00:45:15,888 --> 00:45:17,382
發生了什麼事,姑娘？

408
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:23,421
我在這裡,你知道的。

409
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:28,800
如果你需要任何東西。是的？

410
00:45:32,168 --> 00:45:33,200
是的。

411
00:45:38,845 --> 00:45:40,141
我會讓你回到它。

412
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:44,178
謝謝。

413
00:45:55,785 --> 00:45:58,654
（車門打開、關閉）

414
00:45:59,393 --> 00:46:01,756
（發動機起動,轉速）

415
00:46:23,648 --> 00:46:24,955
（歎息）

416
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:03,521
（布萊恩·葛籣茨）

417
00:47:55,476 --> 00:47:57,509
（電話鈴聲）

418
00:47:58,875 --> 00:47:59,951
缺點:你好？

419
00:48:02,483 --> 00:48:03,515
愛琳。

420
00:48:20,765 --> 00:48:23,865
愛琳。事情如何？
嘿,你可能會跟著我
通過這裏現在。

421
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:28,771
我們現在就在這裡,看。

422
00:48:41,093 --> 00:48:42,455
騙子怎麼了？

423
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:46,888
布萊恩在哪裡,邁克？

424
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,231
很抱歉拖拽您
一路進城。

425
00:48:51,268 --> 00:48:54,698
你一定很高興
有布萊恩
和你一起回到房子里。

426
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,403
當然,你瞭解你自己。

427
00:48:56,405 --> 00:48:57,734
你估計嗎？

428
00:48:57,736 --> 00:48:59,571
上帝知道我的女兒
搬回了房子里,

429
00:48:59,573 --> 00:49:01,276
我們會撕扯條
彼此關閉。

430
00:49:02,246 --> 00:49:03,971
他是澳大利亞,是嗎？

431
00:49:03,973 --> 00:49:05,445
澳大利亞,是的。

432
00:49:05,447 --> 00:49:08,646
這不總是這樣嗎？
傷透了母親的心。

433
00:49:10,452 --> 00:49:11,583
完全。

434
00:49:12,652 --> 00:49:15,323
看,有人提出過索賠

435
00:49:15,325 --> 00:49:18,821
關於村裡的一次襲擊
幾周前

436
00:49:18,823 --> 00:49:21,626
由一位年輕女子創作
誰在丹·內爾的酒吧

437
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:24,662
當晚
4月18日。

438
00:49:24,664 --> 00:49:27,698
布萊恩說他在家
那天晚上和你在一起。

439
00:49:28,437 --> 00:49:29,535
是嗎？

440
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,572
是的,他是。

441
00:49:33,574 --> 00:49:37,048
-他沒有出去
或任何階段的任何東西...
- 沒有。不。

442
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:40,183
你會再說一遍
在法庭上？

443
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,448
我會。是的。

444
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:48,422
好吧。看,我知道,
嗯,布萊恩的
一個努力工作的人。

445
00:49:48,424 --> 00:49:49,819
是這樣嗎？

446
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:52,393
我會給他一個喊叫
現在在那裡為你。就一分鐘。

447
00:49:53,495 --> 00:49:55,363
這有點多,邁克,不是嗎,

448
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
把我拖出來
半夜
只是問一個簡單的問題？

449
203:00:00,000 --> 00:49:58,236
我們必須被看作是
做我們的工作,愛琳。

450
00:50:02,141 --> 00:50:03,569
（門打開）

451
00:50:29,168 --> 00:50:30,233
（車門關閉）

452
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,829
（深深地歎息）

453
00:50:49,386 --> 00:50:50,583
你沒事吧？

454
00:50:52,587 --> 00:50:56,457
哼。需要喝幾品脫。

455
00:50:56,459 --> 00:50:58,723
我的麵包車正在回去的路上。
我們可能會把它撿起來。

456
00:51:07,305 --> 00:51:09,734
還有其他人出來嗎,
你還記得嗎？

457
00:51:12,871 --> 00:51:14,068
我不能告訴你。

458
00:51:26,819 --> 00:51:28,819
我離開你之後發生了什麼？

459
00:51:29,954 --> 00:51:31,327
我們喝了幾杯。

460
00:51:33,463 --> 00:51:35,430
我們沒有做的任何事情
想當年。

461
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:40,567
那是什麼意思？

462
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:45,638
上帝啊。。。

463
00:51:49,446 --> 00:51:51,974
我最好回去嗎
去他媽的澳大利亞？

464
00:51:53,648 --> 00:51:56,451
是這樣嗎？被拖拽
變成這個狗屎。

465
00:51:58,884 --> 00:52:00,884
你不會去
任何地方,好嗎？

466
00:52:02,426 --> 00:52:03,524
你聽到我說話了嗎？

467
00:52:06,397 --> 00:52:07,858
（水流）

468
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,126
（烏鴉嗤之）

469
00:52:31,653 --> 00:52:32,685
謝謝,媽媽。

470
00:52:49,902 --> 00:52:52,837
瑪麗:暫停
不會持久,是重點。

471
00:52:52,839 --> 00:52:54,839
幾周後,
水會冷卻,

472
00:52:54,841 --> 00:52:57,380
所有這些都會神奇地重置。

473
00:52:57,382 --> 00:53:00,944
牡蠣養殖者再次創造它,
就像什麼都沒發生過一樣。

474
00:53:01,716 --> 00:53:03,221
這就是時間的作用。

475
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:06,180
教訓浪費在年輕人身上。

476
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:08,523
女人:愛琳？愛琳。

477
00:53:10,054 --> 00:53:12,824
是否有任何額外的時間
我可以在下周接機嗎？

478
00:53:12,826 --> 00:53:14,727
你可能會報導莎拉的轉變。

479
00:53:16,335 --> 00:53:17,763
你沒收到她的消息嗎？

480
00:53:21,571 --> 00:53:23,241
我有。是的。

481
00:53:42,922 --> 00:53:44,592
我們有衛兵進入我們。

482
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,530
耶拉,不...

483
00:53:48,532 --> 00:53:50,257
他們只是在看
與客戶交談

484
00:53:50,259 --> 00:53:51,797
幾周後。

485
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:55,471
這是一個安靜的夜晚...

486
00:53:56,606 --> 00:53:58,133
這就是我告訴他們的。

487
00:54:02,876 --> 00:54:04,447
現在會更在他們的隊伍中

488
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,449
要研究
外國拖網漁船強姦
我們的海洋,對吧？

489
00:54:08,585 --> 00:54:11,982
他們的雙手被綁住,
那是什麼
無論如何,他們都會告訴你。

490
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:20,298
為什麼耶穌不是
出生在澳大利亞？

491
00:54:20,597 --> 00:54:21,860
嘿。

492
00:54:21,862 --> 00:54:22,894
-啊,因為他是...
-（模糊的喋喋不休）

493
00:54:22,896 --> 00:54:23,928
艾瑪:晚上,小夥子們。

494
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,601
-丹:好的。
-是的。

495
00:54:26,603 --> 00:54:28,097
你和我們在一起嗎？
明天又來了,姑娘？

496
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:30,198
我是,是的。謝謝。

497
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,738
-夜給你。
-丹:夜。

498
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,805
布萊恩:晚上。

499
00:54:34,743 --> 00:54:36,479
因為沒有智者...

500
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:41,616
也沒有處女。

501
00:54:41,618 --> 00:54:43,244
（布萊恩笑）

502
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:44,454
-好吧。
-嗯。

503
00:54:44,951 --> 00:54:45,983
丹:好人。

504
00:54:48,086 --> 00:54:50,988
-來吧...
-（模糊的喋喋不休）

505
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,830
-丹:夜。
-老人:夜之歸你。晚上。

506
00:55:05,675 --> 00:55:06,839
（敲門）

507
00:55:14,618 --> 00:55:15,716
布萊恩在嗎？

508
00:55:16,455 --> 00:55:17,784
（奧斯卡咕咕）

509
00:55:17,786 --> 00:55:19,852
費用將是
對他不利。

510
00:55:19,854 --> 00:55:23,185
他需要展示自己
在地區法院前
今天週,

511
00:55:23,187 --> 00:55:26,122
和初步還押候審
將製作
在法官面前。

512
00:55:26,124 --> 00:55:27,860
為了他媽的緣故,邁克。

513
00:55:27,862 --> 00:55:30,093
看,只要確保
他在那裡,你會嗎？

514
00:55:46,485 --> 00:55:48,386
愛琳:你告訴他們的
那天晚上你沒有出去。

515
00:55:51,985 --> 00:55:54,282
但我們都知道
不過,這是一個謊言。

516
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:56,020
愛琳,你對此瞭解多少？

517
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:01,498
弗朗西虐待她
多少年,

518
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,897
沒有人
想什麼都想。

519
00:56:04,899 --> 00:56:07,867
突然間,每個人都認為
布萊恩是問題所在。

520
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:12,366
誰從不伸出援手
在他生命中的一個女人身上。

521
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:15,237
你自己說了些什麼
是在發生在莎拉身上之後。

522
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:19,076
也許是法蘭西,是的。

523
00:56:20,948 --> 00:56:22,981
但你不想要
聽聽她的聲音？

524
00:56:48,206 --> 00:56:49,238
你沒事吧？

525
00:56:52,111 --> 00:56:53,583
鄧尼斯:莎拉的
今天不會再來了嗎？

526
00:57:04,222 --> 00:57:05,892
（模糊的喋喋不休）

527
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,028
你什麼時候回來？

528
00:57:44,163 --> 00:57:45,195
我不知道。

529
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,711
會發生什麼
如果他回來受審？

530
00:57:57,583 --> 00:58:03,345
水稻:
<i>♪ 在清醒和睡覺時</我>

531
00:58:04,788 --> 00:58:09,252
<i>♪ 我渴望在那裡</我>

00:58:10,794 --> 00:58:14,389

00:58:14,391 --> 00:58:18,602
<i>♪ 那些善良的街道</i>

534
00:58:18,604 --> 00:58:24,234
<i> ♪ 我出生的地方</我>

535
00:58:27,041 --> 00:58:28,073
加油。

536
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:31,681
它是如何完成的？

537
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:34,442
嗯？

538
00:58:35,852 --> 00:58:41,020
<i>♪ 和男孩們</我>

布萊恩和帕迪:

541
00:58:50,526 --> 00:58:51,602
（笑）

542
00:58:57,302 --> 00:58:59,500
什麼都沒有
你錯了,帕迪,夥計。

543
00:59:00,503 --> 00:59:01,975
嗯。

544
00:59:01,977 --> 00:59:04,406
你只是在玩一把戲
在我們其他人身上。

545
00:59:08,577 --> 00:59:10,181
你還有哪些其他歌曲？

546
00:59:12,889 --> 00:59:15,285
<>·麥</我>嗯？

547
00:59:17,322 --> 00:59:19,388
也許是<i>野生漫遊者</我>？

548
00:59:25,902 --> 00:59:26,934
好人。

549
00:59:29,202 --> 00:59:30,234
嗯。

550
00:59:32,073 --> 00:59:35,745
邁克:申訴人
等了一個星期
在向她報告之前

551
00:59:35,747 --> 00:59:40,013
並聲稱她是
跟著到當地的碼頭
在襲擊當晚

552
00:59:40,015 --> 00:59:43,951
並且被告
隨後強姦了她
在那兒。

553
00:59:43,953 --> 00:59:48,351
被告的母親
已經提供了他
有不在場證明,法官。

554
00:59:48,353 --> 00:59:51,728
她重申了這一說法。
她和被告
在房子里

555
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:53,455
在工作時間
當晚,

556
00:59:53,457 --> 00:59:56,392
被告人仍保留
和她在一起的房子里

557
00:59:56,394 --> 00:59:58,097
在工作時間
聲稱的攻擊？

558
00:59:59,496 --> 01:00:01,133
我願意,閣下。是的。

559
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:02,805
法官:嗯。

560
01:00:04,633 --> 01:00:07,304
這是一個嚴重的指控。

561
01:00:07,306 --> 01:00:10,780
這也是第一次
被告
一直在法庭上。

562
01:00:13,147 --> 01:00:15,180
現在我的意見
還不夠...

563
01:00:15,182 --> 01:00:18,480
在證據書中
供國家起訴。

564
01:00:18,482 --> 01:00:21,989
費用將被發回重審
回到民進黨
以獲取進一步說明。

565
01:00:21,991 --> 01:00:26,125
我也相信這個收費
本來不應該是
被帶到法庭上。

566
01:00:27,326 --> 01:00:29,029
呃,被告
可以自由離開。

567
01:00:33,332 --> 01:00:34,397
下一步是什麼？

568
01:00:35,664 --> 01:00:37,499
邁克:第15號檔,法官。

569
01:00:38,634 --> 01:00:40,007
醉酒和無序。

570
01:01:03,164 --> 01:01:04,460
（歎息）

571
01:01:05,364 --> 01:01:07,133
（水湧出）

572
01:01:41,169 --> 01:01:42,267
（呼氣）

573
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,907
（模糊的喋喋不休）

574
01:03:02,646 --> 01:03:05,251
鄧尼斯:艾琳。
來這裡一分鐘,好嗎？

575
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:13,457
她最近出席的情況如何？

576
01:03:17,496 --> 01:03:20,266
16個班次中有14個班次被遺漏。

577
01:03:20,268 --> 01:03:23,797
莎拉:我可以做
日子一天過去了。請。

578
01:03:23,799 --> 01:03:25,975
鄧尼斯:還有其他人嗎？
同時錯過了一個班次？

579
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,672
您可以讓我們知道
至少,你知道,
被叫來生病了。

580
01:03:32,181 --> 01:03:33,708
但是我必須讓你走,姑娘。

581
01:03:39,419 --> 01:03:40,550
你是對的,鄧尼斯。

582
01:03:43,093 --> 01:03:45,687
我應該讓你知道
我發生了什麼事。

583
01:03:47,328 --> 01:03:49,196
這是錯誤,是嗎？

584
01:03:51,167 --> 01:03:53,530
一切都非常方便
但是,對你來說,不是嗎？

585
01:03:55,006 --> 01:03:58,007
在法蘭西的牡蠣袋之間
和其他一切,

586
01:03:58,009 --> 01:03:59,701
每個人都有他們的
他媽的閉上眼睛。

587
01:04:03,278 --> 01:04:04,882
鄧尼斯:等等,等一下。

588
01:04:07,645 --> 01:04:08,677
莎拉？

589
01:04:10,549 --> 01:04:12,582
怎麼樣
牡蠣袋,莎拉？

590
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:21,624
來吧,小夥子們,專注,
回到工作上。

591
01:04:27,632 --> 01:04:29,797
她是什麼意思
關於法蘭西的牡蠣,愛琳？

592
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:33,240
回家。

593
01:04:34,309 --> 01:04:36,012
-什麼？
-回家一天。

594
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:53,194
（愛琳咯咯笑）

595
01:04:53,196 --> 01:04:54,327
（咕咕）

596
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:57,528
奧斯卡,愛。

597
01:04:59,433 --> 01:05:02,731
你不能只是帶走他
出入日托
沒有告訴我。

598
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:04,007
他不是你的兒子。

599
01:05:05,472 --> 01:05:07,406
我不想要你
再照顧他了。

600
01:05:07,408 --> 01:05:09,408
他媽的,愛琳。
她仍然是他的祖母。

601
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,379
如果你真的和她坐在一起,

602
01:05:13,381 --> 01:05:15,645
你無法否認
發生了什麼事,愛琳。

603
01:05:15,647 --> 01:05:18,582
-缺點:對她放輕鬆。
-愛琳:沒有。

604
01:05:18,584 --> 01:05:20,584
為了他媽的緣故,
她需要聽到它。

605
01:05:23,061 --> 01:05:25,094
（腳步聲後退）

606
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,968
缺點:我會和她談談。

607
01:05:57,623 --> 01:05:59,260
你必須小心他。

608
01:06:22,516 --> 01:06:26,452
無時無刻不在
莎拉在這裡,
當它是愛琳的房間。

609
01:06:36,629 --> 01:06:39,531
我曾經和她媽媽開玩笑
關於你們倆,

610
01:06:39,533 --> 01:06:40,829
我們會成為岳父母。

611
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,273
鄧尼斯:她在撒謊嗎
關於牡蠣袋,愛琳？

612
01:07:21,443 --> 01:07:24,642
我得把你
直到我弄清楚
故事是什麼。

613
01:07:28,384 --> 01:07:29,812
暫停令已經解除。

614
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,848
瘋狂幾個星期。

615
01:07:32,850 --> 01:07:35,422
可能必須僱用
多了幾隻手。

616
01:07:36,392 --> 01:07:37,820
（繼續模糊地談論）

617
01:07:48,437 --> 01:07:49,964
丹:所以故事就這樣流傳開來,

618
01:07:49,966 --> 01:07:51,768
幾個月來,
人們認為妻子死了

619
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:55,068
因為她摔倒了
井試圖拯救
火雞。

620
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:56,938
這是一些聰明的刺,
警衛。

621
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:59,776
女人1:那就太好了
讓你都過來
下個星期天彌撒后。

622
01:08:00,713 --> 01:08:02,449
女人2:
給你休息一次。

623
01:08:02,451 --> 01:08:04,880
（模糊的喋喋不休）

丹:我們保留權利
拒絕在這裡服務,愛。

633
01:08:33,141 --> 01:08:34,514
幫自己一個忙

顯示面孔
只是為了它。

這是否意味著
對你來說絕對沒什麼？

難道沒有心嗎
還是有感覺在你裡面？
