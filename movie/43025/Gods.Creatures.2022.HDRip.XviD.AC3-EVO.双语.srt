1
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,245
漫长的一天 
Long day ahead.

2
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:07,655
艾琳?
Aileen?

3
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:10,058
谢谢你 爱 
Thanks  love.

4
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:15,997
更像是驴子闯进来的，玛丽 
More like donkeys broken in  Mary.

5
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,399
妈的，我们本来什么都有可能的 
Fuck's sake  like  we could have been anything.

6
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:24,337
老师 护士 美发师 
Teachers  nurses  hairdressers.

7
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:28,976
理发师吗?别这么野心勃勃，莎拉 
Hairdressers? Don't be so ambitious  Sarah.

8
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,680
你没听到她叫我们蠢货吗?实际的驴  
Did you not just hear her calling us donkeys? Actual asses  like.

9
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:35,315
但真是个混蛋，希拉，姑娘 
But what an arse  Sheila  girl.

10
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:55,302
我的儿子!
My son!

11
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:57,304
不!
No!

12
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,474
不!
No!

13
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:03,611
马克!
Mark!

14
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:50,151
如果我什么都不做，我就教这个小混蛋游泳 
If I do nothing else  I'm teaching this little fecker how to swim.

15
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,552
艾琳 
Erin.

16
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:53,087
耶稣基督 女孩 
Jesus Christ  girl.

17
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,989
Yera……
Yera...

18
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,924
操的缘故 它们真的生活在水上
for fuck's sake. They literally live on the water

19
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,159
他们没有一个人学会怎么做 
and none of them learn how.

20
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,127
你知道这是传统，艾琳 
You know it's the tradition  Erin.

21
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:02,864
怎么，知道就会倒霉吗?
What  it's bad luck to know?

22
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:06,868
如果他们不会游泳，他们就不会跳下去帮助别人 
If they can't swim  they won't jump in and help anyone else.

23
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:09,770
一群自私的混蛋，太关心自己的皮肤了 
Pack of selfish wankers  too worried about their own skins.

24
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:12,006
怎么了，奥斯卡，亲爱的?
What's wrong  Oscar  love?

25
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:15,910
一晚上会哭三四次 
Wakes up crying three  four times a night.

26
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:18,880
灾难 像 -天啊，我记得和你在一起的夜晚 
-Disaster  like. -Jesus Christ  I remember nights with you.

27
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:20,648
无法睡眠 
Could never sleep.

28
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:23,017
骗我说我只能让你哭 
Con telling me I just had to let you cry.

29
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,151
我怎么能这么做呢?
How could I do that?

30
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:27,188
听到噪音 
Hearing every noise.

31
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,523
说句公道话，你是比较容易相处的孩子 
You were the easier child  to be fair.

32
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,995
进展得怎样?我有段时间没见到你了 
How's it going? I haven't see you in a while.

33
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,030
事情怎么样了?
How's things?

34
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:11,699
很高兴见到你 
Good to see you.

35
00:07:13,134 --> 00:07:14,168
你好 丹 
Hi  Dan.

36
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,103
布莱恩·奥哈拉?你在这里做什么?
Brian O'Hara? What the hell are you doing here?

37
00:07:16,137 --> 00:07:17,672
天啊，你这么大 
Jesus Christ  the size of you.

38
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:18,806
你变得越强大……到这里来 
The stronger you get... Come here.

39
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,975
从外表上看，我们都更宽广更睿智了，丹，小子 
We're all wider and wiser by the look Dan boy.

40
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,210
加勒比海盗 -哦，孩子，一切都好吗?
-After a while. -Well boy  how's things?

41
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,616
布莱恩 
Brian.

42
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:32,019
基督 布莱恩……
Christ  Brian...

43
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,727
妈，看看你 
Mom  look at you  huh.

44
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,697
——你的头发 你一点也没变 
- Your hair. You haven't changed a bit.

45
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:47,735
这是谁?
Who's this  huh?

46
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:50,604
是我的小弟弟，对吧?
It's my baby brother  is it?

47
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:52,740
什么!不 不 不 耶稣基督 
What! No  no  no. Jesus Christ.

48
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,008
哦，到我这儿来 
Oh  come here to me.

49
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,544
哦 
Oh.

50
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:57,945
帕迪，最近怎么样?
Well  Paddy  how's things?

51
00:07:57,979 --> 00:07:59,981
你个混蛋 
You son of a bitch.

52
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:02,083
——布莱恩!——艾琳!
- Brian! - Erin!

53
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:04,251
什么他妈的!你在这里做什么?
What the fuck! What are you doing here?

54
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:06,053
我该回来了，不是吗?
It's 'bout time I came back  isn't it?

55
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:10,691
——莎拉 ——布莱恩 
- Sarah. - Brian.

56
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:13,527
马克·菲兹死了你才会回到我们身边，是吗?
It takes Mark Fitz dying for you to come back to us  does it?

57
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:15,096
什么?
What?

58
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,498
这是给他的吗?
That's who this is for?

59
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,202
我操，就是这样 
Ah  fuck me  it is.

60
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:24,805
我很抱歉 
I'm so sorry.

61
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,277
给我一点时间 
Just give me one second.

62
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:33,914
玛丽 嗯…
Mary  um...

63
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,585
我很抱歉，玛丽 
I'm so sorry  Mary.

64
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,587
-很抱歉 ——谢谢

65
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:55,803
帕迪这样多久了?

66
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,840
在这个阶段已经有好几年了

67
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:04,045
-回来一定很奇怪 嗯 
-Must be weird being back. -Hmm.

68
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:05,846
可能是一模一样的，对吧?
Probably the exact fuckin' same  though  is it?

69
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:09,984
她会停下来吗?
Does she ever stop going?

70
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,753
你不在的时候，一秒钟都没有 
Oh  not a second all the time you were gone.

71
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:16,791
一分钟 爱 
One minute  love.

72
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:26,333
爸爸，是吗?
That dad  is it?

73
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:29,236
你应该出去见见他 他就像这样 
You should go out and meet him. He'd like that.

74
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:31,205
继续 
Go on.

75
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,022
你好吗?-哦 是的 是的 
-You good? -Oh yeah  yeah.

76
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:55,396
看到他们握手真奇怪 
Strange seeing them shake hands.

77
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,999
他与众不同，不是吗?成长为自己 
He's different  isn't he? Grown into himself.

78
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:00,835
你认为吗?
Do you reckon?

79
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:04,171
母亲知道 
A mother knows.

80
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,348
你脸上的表情 
The look on your face.

81
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,952
-别那么震惊，伙计 -什么?
-Don't be so shocked  mate. -What?

82
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:22,223
-她喂过你吗?-哦 不 还没有 
- Has she fed you? - Uh  no. Not yet.

83
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,660
很难相信他回来了，是吧?
Hard to believe he's home  huh?

84
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,164
回家真好，好吧 
Good to be home now  all right.

85
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:36,103
那么，你在澳大利亚 
So  you're in Australia.

86
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:39,273
多久没和我们联系了?
Not been in touch with us in how long?

87
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,977
你突然就有了回家的念头 
And you get a notion  all of a sudden  to come home.

88
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,748
糟糕的天气，该死的工作，却不告诉任何人?
Shit weather  fuck all work  and not tell anyone?

89
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:51,452
是的 差不多就是这么大了，是的 
Yeah. That's about the size of it  yeah.

90
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,921
拜托，你怎么回来了?
Come on  why are you back  like?

91
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:57,158
嗯…
Uh...

92
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,160
水稻的牡蛎 
Paddy's oysters.

93
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:06,167
基督 你又要从零开始了 你攒钱了吗?
Christ. Oh  you be starting from nothing again. Have you money saved?

94
00:11:07,268 --> 00:11:09,870
牡蛎把工作 他们并不便宜 
Oysters take work. They aren't cheap.

95
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:13,307
但我们还有许可证 
But we still have the license for it.

96
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,076
我一直在还款 
I kept up the payments.

97
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:20,114
Con放弃后的每一年 
Every year since Con gave up on it.

98
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:23,350
以防 
Just in case.

99
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:55,249
它向前倾斜 -好的 
-Tilt it forward. -Okay.

100
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:58,986
-是那边吗?——是的 
- Is it that way? - Yes.

101
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,454
-可以吗?-是的 
- That all right? - Yeah.

102
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,024
我看到你照顾它了 
I see you looked after it.

103
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,427
我父亲再也无法忍受了，
My father wasn't able for it anymore

104
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:17,965
你走了，一直没走 
and you were gone and stayed gone.

105
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:20,034
仅此而已 没有其他的选择 
That was that. No other option.

106
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,837
不想和别人合作 
Didn't want to work it with anyone else.

107
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,610
上帝啊，这太不真实了 
Jesus Christ  it's unreal.

108
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:30,911
地面有些地方有点软 
Ground's a bit soft in parts.

109
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,047
你得换一些支架 
You'll have to replace some of your trestles.

110
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,215
为你的牡蛎和包装袋找一个供应商 
Find a supplier for your oysters and bags.

111
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:38,586
那就从种子或半生的种子开始吧 
Start with seeds or half-growns  then.

112
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,156
至少在它们成熟前一年，就能盈利 
Be a year at least before they mature  turn profit.

113
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:43,857
你得另找收入 
You'll have to find another income.

114
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:48,095
但你自己也知道 
But you know that yourself.

115
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:50,964
这不是你做不到的，布莱恩 是吗?
That's nothing you can't manage  though  Brian. Is it?

116
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:53,334
不是一个麻烦 操的缘故 
Not a bother. For fuck's sake.

117
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:48,956
哦 对不起 艾琳 忘记打卡了 
Oh  sorry  Aileen. Forgot to clock out.

118
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,925
-给我一分钟 -不 爱 
-Just give me a minute. -No rush  love.

119
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:10,944
漂亮的牡蛎 谢谢你 佛朗斯 
Fine looking oysters. Thanks  Francie.

120
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:13,347
如果他们抓到我们，你就疯了 
Be some craic if they caught us.

121
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,349
别跟我这么说 
Oh  don't say that to me.

122
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:18,952
你快点吧 来吧 
Hurry up will you. Come on.

123

-晚饭见，好吗?-走吧，走吧 
-See you for dinner  yeah? -Go on  aye  go away.

125
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:38,972
是安全的 
Be safe.

126
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:39,501

谢谢你 伙计 
Thank you  guys.

128
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:12,667

时间很快就会把这一切都看清楚 
Time puts it all into perspective very quickly.

193

他说话很粗暴 
He was brutal with his words.

194
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,859
尽管如此，他还是和其他人一样

马克也是这么死的 
Sure Mark died doing the same thing.

208
00:25:03,904 --> 00:25:07,108
那不是你最终会发生的事，就是你会被抓 
And that's either what will happen to you eventually  or you'll be caught.

209
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:10,544

你就像只老鼠 
You're like a rat.

222
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:01,622
大部分都是我的旧东西 
Most of this is my old shite.

223
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,126
它早已没有任何用处了 
It's long past being any use.

224

我得说，涨潮后晚上再出发 
head out in the evening after the tide  I'd say.

229
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:21,675
我猜你早上有空吧?
So  you're free in the morning  I take it?

230
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:27,014
我可以给你一份工作 
Could have a job for you.

231
00:27:27,047 --> 00:27:30,184
我是说，把这些都用了，我可以额外给你一点钱 
I mean  use these away sure and I could pay you a bit extra on top.

232
00:27:34,388 --> 00:27:35,656
这很艰难，不是吗?
It's tough  isn't it...

233
00:27:37,158 --> 00:27:38,225
你一个人做吗?
doin' it by yourself?

234

这对一个人来说太过分了

这是你父亲学到的教训

236
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,042
这些很适合布莱恩，对吧?

237
00:29:10,084 --> 00:29:11,352
玛丽，你还好吗?
Are you all right  Mary?

238
00:29:15,055 --> 00:29:19,059

夜里的声音……
A sound at night...

240
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:26,967
可能是他在这里四处走动 
and it might be him moving around the place.

241
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:32,139
奇怪的安慰

Everything supposedly shifts  but...

249
00:32:31,418 --> 00:32:34,321

273
00:34:31,138 --> 00:34:33,473
你可以去世界上任何地方 
you could go anywhere in the world.

274
00:34:33,508 --> 00:34:35,242
没有条件 你会去哪里?
No conditions. Where would you go?

275
00:34:37,277 --> 00:34:38,412
你知道吗?
Do you know what...

276
00:34:39,514 --> 00:34:43,785
我宁愿只是…时光倒流……
I'd rather just... reel the years back in...

277
00:34:43,818 --> 00:34:46,588
让你和你父亲坐下来让你们表现得像个成年人 
and sit you and your father down and make ye act like adults.

278
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:56,531
想象你们相处得很好，住在同一个屋檐下 
It's nice imagining you getting along  living under the one roof.

279
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:06,173
但我为你现在的样子感到骄傲 
But I'm proud the way you are now  though.

280
00:35:06,206 --> 00:35:08,576
就好像作品本身就是它的开始和结束 
It's as if the work itself was the beginning and the end of it.

281
00:35:10,377 --> 00:35:11,679
嘿 丹 
Hey  Dan.

282
00:35:11,713 --> 00:35:14,314
——嘿 莎拉 -能给我来杯威士忌吗?
- Hey  Sarah. - Can I get a whiskey  please?

283
00:35:14,348 --> 00:35:15,583
当然可以 是的 
You can  of course. Yeah.

284
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,320
你想再喝一杯吗?
Did you want another drink?

285
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:24,324
不 不 呆在那里 我去拿，好吧 
No. No  stay there. I'll get it  all right.

286
00:35:30,865 --> 00:35:32,332
我给你拿这个 
Let me get you this.

287
00:35:32,366 --> 00:35:35,302
哦 你是大 谢谢 虽然 
Oh  you're grand. Thanks  though.

288
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:44,311
你晚上出去了吗?
You out for the night?

289
00:35:44,344 --> 00:35:45,913
看完这个我们就知道了 
We'll see now after this one.

290
00:35:45,947 --> 00:35:47,147
嗯 
Mmm-hmm.

291
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:53,621
说实话，我真不敢相信你还在这 
I can't believe you're still here  to be honest.

292
00:35:55,757 --> 00:35:58,258
我以为你早就抛弃这里了 
I thought you would have long abandoned this place.

293
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:01,696
我不知道你为什么会这么想 
I don't know why you'd think that.

294
00:36:03,463 --> 00:36:05,332
我需要的一切都在这里 
Everything I ever needed was here.

295
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:08,201
不用自己去找 
Didn't have to go looking for it.

296
00:36:09,504 --> 00:36:10,505
嗯 
Hmm.

297
00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:15,409
像什么?
Like what?

298
00:36:19,514 --> 00:36:22,517
不 我们年轻的时候经常一起疯，对吧?
Nah. We used to have a good craic together when we were younger  didn't we?

299
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:25,285
-美国吗?-Mmm-hmm 
-Us? -Mmm-hmm.

300
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,723
那是很久以前的事了 
It was so long ago.

301
00:36:30,424 --> 00:36:32,325
如果我是你，我就不会纠结于此 
I wouldn't get hung up on it if I were you.

302
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,497
你在喝什么?
What are you drinking?

303
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:42,570
去吧，给我个惊喜 
Go on sure  surprise me.

304
00:36:47,508 --> 00:36:50,410
我 嗯…两个一样的 
I  um... two of the same again.

305
00:36:50,444 --> 00:36:52,379
-她在喝威士忌，是吗?嗯 
- Uh  she's having whiskey  is she? Mmm-hmm.

306
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:57,217
那就这样吧 
There you go.

307
00:36:59,486 --> 00:37:00,487
有……
There's...

308
00:37:07,729 --> 00:37:09,664
退潮时间是什么时候?
What time is low tide due?

309
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:11,532
继续说，好吗?
Go on  will you?

310
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:14,669
好的 晚上 宠物 
All right. Night  pet.

311
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,804
晚安，各位 
Good night.

312
00:37:32,954 --> 00:37:35,523
哪天晚上我可以借你的上衣穿，艾琳 
I might borrow that top off you one of the nights  Aileen.

313
00:37:37,091 --> 00:37:38,626
明天见，姑娘 
I'll see you tomorrow  girl.

314
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:21,562
对不起 小伙子 
Sorry  lads.

315
00:39:26,868 --> 00:39:28,669
——早上好 ——早上好 
- Good morning. - Good morning.

316
00:39:47,521 --> 00:39:48,789
你昨晚出去了吗?
Were you out last night?

317
00:39:48,823 --> 00:39:51,626
不 不 我不是 是你吗?
No  no. I was not. Were you out?

318
00:40:27,128 --> 00:40:28,596
晚安，是吗?
Good night so  was it?

319
00:41:03,064 --> 00:41:05,566
玛丽 你看 
Mary  look.

320
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,203
的文采 停止传送带上 艾琳 
-Look at that. -Stop the belt. Aileen.

321
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:15,910
真菌 狗屎 
-Fungus. -Shit.

322
00:41:19,714 --> 00:41:20,982
我们也有真菌 
We've got fungus  too.

323
00:41:22,016 --> 00:41:23,217
让我看看!
Let me see that!

324
00:41:26,087 --> 00:41:28,589
检查一下剩下的存货 
Check the rest of the stock.

325
00:41:28,622 --> 00:41:29,857
把这些扔了 
Throw these ones out.

326
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:33,260
操的缘故!一场灾难 
Fuck's sake! What a disaster.

327
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:43,004
耶稣!
Jesus!

328
00:41:46,307 --> 00:41:48,009
莎拉?——不要再碰我 
-Sarah? -Don't touch me.

329
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:10,631
特此警告
You are hereby warned

330
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:13,034
停止养殖所有生蚝
to cease cultivation of all oyster holdings

331
00:42:13,067 --> 00:42:14,503
直到进一步通知 
until further notice

332
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:18,906
如果被发现违反暂停，可被吊销执照 
punishable by loss of license if caught in breach of the moratorium.

333
00:42:18,939 --> 00:42:22,576
你今天收获的所有牡蛎都必须销毁 
Any oysters you harvested today must be destroyed.

334
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:34,955
你有工作给我吗?
Do you have any work for me?

335
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:37,825
不，我这段时间都不需要你了，不 
No  I'm not gonna need you again for a while  no.

336
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:39,994
像其他人一样低头，你就会没事的 
Keep your head down like the rest of 'em  you'll be grand.

337
00:42:40,027 --> 00:42:41,695
我会收回你欠我的，所以 
I'll take what you owe me  so.

338
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:49,937
好了，伙计们，把他们都扔出去 是的 
All right  lads  let's throw them all out. Yeah.

339
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:58,005
我们现在该怎么办，比如?哦 
What are we supposed to do now  like? Oh.

340
00:43:58,038 --> 00:44:00,307
同样的事情也发生过，大概在七八年前，对吧?
Same thing happened  about seven or eight years ago  didn't it?

341
00:44:00,341 --> 00:44:01,742
几乎摧毁了牡蛎养殖户 
Nearly destroyed the oyster farmers.

342
00:44:01,775 --> 00:44:04,445
一想到他们在家无所事事 对任何人都没有好处 
The idea of them at home doing nothing. No good for anyone.

343
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:07,348
她的情况似乎越来越糟了，不是吗?
It seems to be gotten worse and worse for her  doesn't it?

344
00:44:07,915 --> 00:44:09,116
可怜的cratur 
Poor cratur.

345
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:13,420
她不是故意要咬你的 
She didn't mean to bite at you.

346
00:44:15,122 --> 00:44:18,659
如果弗朗西做了什么，她应该说出来 
If Francie's done something  she needs to speak up about it.

347
00:44:46,854 --> 00:44:48,255
——嘿 爱 -你好 
- Hey  love. - Hiya.

348
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:52,359
你忙吗?
Are you busy?

349
00:44:52,393 --> 00:44:57,131
不是时候，不是 我只是在装修房子 
Not a great time  no. I'm just doing a few jobs on the house.

350
00:44:57,164 --> 00:45:00,000
妈妈说他们几天没在工厂看到你了 
Mom says they haven't seen you in the factory in a few days.

351
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:03,337
你终于闻到这味道了，是吗?
The smell's finally getting to you  is it?

352
00:45:04,438 --> 00:45:05,439
不 
No.

353
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:12,179
之后呢，姑娘?
What's after happening  girl?

354
00:45:15,416 --> 00:45:18,219
我在这里，你知道的 
I'm here  you know.

355
00:45:20,487 --> 00:45:23,724
如果你需要什么 是吗?
If you need anything. Yeah?

356
00:45:27,027 --> 00:45:28,028
是的 
Yeah.

357
00:45:33,568 --> 00:45:35,002
我不打扰你了 
I'll let you get back to it.

358
00:45:38,038 --> 00:45:39,039
谢谢 
Thanks.

359
00:47:53,641 --> 00:47:54,875
喂?
Hello?

360
00:47:57,311 --> 00:47:58,312
艾琳 
Aileen.

361
00:48:15,563 --> 00:48:18,600
艾琳 近况如何?你现在可以跟我走了 
Aileen. How are things? Hey  you might follow me through here now.

362
00:48:22,002 --> 00:48:23,538
我们现在才进来，你看 
We're just in here now  look.

363
00:48:36,016 --> 00:48:37,284
大会进行得怎么样了?
How's Con gettin' on?

364
00:48:39,486 --> 00:48:41,623
迈克 布莱恩在哪儿吗?
Where's Brian  Mike?

365
00:48:41,656 --> 00:48:44,091
抱歉把你大老远拉过来 
Sorry to drag you all the way into town.

366
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,463
你一定很高兴布莱恩回到家里和你在一起 
You must be delighted to have Brian back in the house with you.

367
00:48:49,496 --> 00:48:51,231
当然，你自己也知道 
Sure  you know yourself.

368
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:52,299
你认为吗?
Do you reckon?

369
00:48:52,332 --> 00:48:54,368
天知道如果我的女儿们搬回来住，
God knows if my girls moved back into the house

370
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:56,136
我们会把对方撕成碎片 
we'd be tearing strips off each other.

371
00:48:57,137 --> 00:48:58,706
他去了澳大利亚，是吗?
Australia he was  was it?

372
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,874
澳大利亚 是的 
Australia  yeah.

373
00:48:59,908 --> 00:49:03,444
不都是这样吗?伤了他母亲的心 
Isn't that always the way? Breaking his mother's heart.

374
00:49:05,312 --> 00:49:06,380
完全正确 
Exactly.

375
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:10,184
听着，已经有人索赔了
Look  there's been a claim made

376
00:49:10,217 --> 00:49:13,588
关于几周前村里发生的一起袭击案
about an assault in the village a couple of weeks back

377
00:49:13,621 --> 00:49:16,423
被丹·内尔的酒吧里的一个年轻女人所杀
by a young woman who was in Dan Nell's pub

378
00:49:16,457 --> 00:49:19,460
在4月18日晚上
on the night of the 18th of April.

379
00:49:19,493 --> 00:49:22,496
布莱恩说那晚他和你在家里 
Brian says he was at home with you that night.

380
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:24,364
是这样吗?
Is that right?

381
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:28,368
他是 是的 
He was  yeah.

382
00:49:28,402 --> 00:49:31,773
-他在任何阶段都没有出去过…-不 不 
-He didn't go out or anything at any stage... -No. No.

383
00:49:31,806 --> 00:49:35,075
你会在法庭上再说一遍吗?
And you'd say that again in court?

384
00:49:35,108 --> 00:49:36,276
我会的 是的 
I would. Yeah.

385
00:49:38,479 --> 00:49:43,250
好的 听着，我知道，布莱恩是个勤奋的人 
All right. Look  I know  well  Brian's a hard-workin' fella.

386
00:49:43,283 --> 00:49:44,384
就是这样吗？
Is that it?

387
00:49:44,418 --> 00:49:47,254
我现在就去叫他 一分钟 
I'll give him a shout for you there now. One minute.

388
00:49:48,355 --> 00:49:49,824
有点过分了，迈克，不是吗，
It's a bit much  Mike  isn't it

389
00:49:49,858 --> 00:49:53,093
大半夜的把我拖出来就为了问一个简单的问题?
to drag me out in the middle of the night just to ask a simple question?

390
00:49:53,126 --> 00:49:55,128
我们得让人看到我们在做本职工作，艾琳 
We've to be seen to be doing our job  Aileen.

391
00:50:44,278 --> 00:50:45,412
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

392
00:50:47,447 --> 00:50:51,318
嗯 我得去喝几杯 
Huh. Need to go for a few pints.

393
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:53,521
我的货车在回来的路上 我们可能会捡起来 
My van is on the way back. We might pick it up.

394
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:04,532
外面还有其他人吗，你记得吗?
Was there anyone else out  do you remember?

395
00:51:07,669 --> 00:51:08,803
我不能告诉你 
I couldn't tell you.

396
00:51:21,649 --> 00:51:23,618
我离开你之后发生了什么?
What happened after I left you?

397
00:51:24,752 --> 00:51:26,219
我们喝了几杯 
We had a few drinks.

398
00:51:28,355 --> 00:51:30,290
没有我们以前做过的事 
Nothing we didn't do back in the day.

399
00:51:34,261 --> 00:51:35,395
这是什么意思?
What does that mean?

400
00:51:39,232 --> 00:51:40,267
耶稣基督……
Jesus Christ...

401
00:51:44,338 --> 00:51:46,741
我是不是该他妈的回澳大利亚去?
Am I better off going back to fucking Australia?

402
00:51:48,509 --> 00:51:51,311
就是这样吗？被扯进这破事里 
Is that it? Getting dragged into this shit.

403
00:51:53,681 --> 00:51:55,683
你哪也不能去，好吗?
You're not going anywhere  all right?

404
00:51:57,317 --> 00:51:58,385
你听到了吗?
Do you hear me?

405
00:52:26,514 --> 00:52:27,515
谢谢 妈妈 
Thanks  Mom.

406
00:52:44,732 --> 00:52:47,635
重点是，禁令不会持续太久 
The moratorium won't last  is the point.

407
00:52:47,669 --> 00:52:49,637
再过几周，水就会冷却，
In a couple of weeks  the water will cool

408
00:52:49,671 --> 00:52:52,272
一切都将神奇地重置 
all will magically reset.

409
00:52:52,305 --> 00:52:55,743
牡蛎养殖户又来了，好像什么都没发生过 
Oyster farmers coining it again  like nothing ever happened.

410
00:52:56,577 --> 00:52:57,945
这就是时间的作用 
That's what time does.

411
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,915
教训在年轻人身上浪费了 
Lesson wasted on the young.

412
00:53:00,948 --> 00:53:03,383
艾琳?艾琳 
Aileen? Aileen.

413
00:53:04,852 --> 00:53:07,622
下周我能加班吗?
Are there any extra hours I can pick up next week?

414
00:53:07,655 --> 00:53:09,557
你可以替莎拉的班 
You might cover Sarah's shifts.

415
00:53:11,258 --> 00:53:12,593
你没有她的消息吗?
You haven't heard from her?

416
00:53:16,463 --> 00:53:17,965
我有 是的 
I have. Yeah.

417
00:53:37,752 --> 00:53:39,453
我们被守卫盯上了 
We've had Guards into us.

418
00:53:41,354 --> 00:53:43,390
Yera 不…
Yera  no...

419
00:53:43,423 --> 00:53:44,992
他们只是想和顾客交谈
they were just looking to talk to customers

420
00:53:45,026 --> 00:53:46,627
他们几个星期前来过 
who were in a few weeks back.

421
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:50,363
那是一个宁静的夜晚……
It was a quiet night...

422
00:53:51,498 --> 00:53:52,900
我就是这么告诉他们的 
That's what I told them.

423
00:53:57,705 --> 00:53:58,940
现在更符合他们的口味了
It'd be more in their line now

424
00:53:58,973 --> 00:54:01,341
看着外国拖网渔船蹂躏我们的海洋，是吧?
to be looking into foreign trawlers raping our oceans  huh?

425
00:54:03,477 --> 00:54:06,781
他们无能为力，反正他们会这么告诉你的 
Their hands are tied  that's what they'll tell you anyway.

426
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,022
为什么耶稣不是出生在澳大利亚?
Why wasn't Jesus born in Australia?

427
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:16,456
Oye 
Oye.

428
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:17,692
啊，因为他…
Ah  'cause he was...

429
00:54:17,725 --> 00:54:18,726
晚上 小伙子 
Night  lads.

430
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,461
——好的 -是的 
- All right. - Yeah.

431
00:54:21,495 --> 00:54:22,864
你明天还来吗，姑娘?
Are you in with us tomorrow again  girl?

432
00:54:22,897 --> 00:54:24,932
我 是的 谢谢 
I am  yeah. Thanks.

433
00:54:24,966 --> 00:54:26,567
-晚安 ——夜 
- Night to you. - Night.

434
00:54:26,601 --> 00:54:27,635
的夜晚 
Night.

435
00:54:29,604 --> 00:54:31,172
因为没有智者……
Because there was no wise men...

436
00:54:35,042 --> 00:54:36,476
不是处女 
No virgins either.

437
00:54:38,012 --> 00:54:39,346
-好的 嗯 
-All right. -Hmm.

438
00:54:39,781 --> 00:54:40,782
好男人 
Good man.

439
00:54:42,884 --> 00:54:45,787
来吧……
Come on...

440
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,660
——夜 -晚安 的夜晚 
- Night. - Night to you. Night.

441
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:10,578
布莱恩在吗?
Is Brian in?

442
00:55:12,647 --> 00:55:14,682
他会被起诉的 
A charge is gonna be brought against him.

443
00:55:14,715 --> 00:55:17,952
他需要在本周的今天到地方法院出庭，
He needs to present himself in front of the district court today week

444
00:55:17,985 --> 00:55:20,888
初审将在法官面前进行 
and an initial remand will be made in front of a judge.

445
00:55:20,922 --> 00:55:22,690
看在上帝的份上，迈克 
For fuck sake  Mike.

446
00:55:22,723 --> 00:55:24,892
听着，确保他在那，好吗?
Look  just make sure he's there  will you?

447
00:55:41,408 --> 00:55:43,110
你告诉他们你那晚没出去 
You told them you weren't out that night.

448
00:55:46,814 --> 00:55:49,016
但我们都知道那是个谎言 
But we both know that's a lie  though.

449
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,818
你知道些什么，艾琳?
What do you know about it  Erin?

450
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:56,389
弗朗西虐待了她多少年，
There's Francie mistreating her for how many years

451
00:55:56,423 --> 00:55:59,727
没人在意 
and nobody thinks anything of it.

452
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,697
突然间所有人都认为布莱恩是问题所在 
And suddenly everyone reckons that Brian's the problem.

453
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:07,101
他这辈子都没碰过女人 
Who never put a hand on a woman in his life.

454
00:56:07,134 --> 00:56:10,004
你自己也说莎拉出事后出事了 
You said yourself something was after happening to Sarah.

455
00:56:11,739 --> 00:56:13,875
也许是弗朗西 
Maybe it was Francie  yeah.

456
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:17,812
但你不想听听她的说法吗?
But you don't want to hear her side?

457
00:56:43,004 --> 00:56:43,804
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

458
00:56:46,941 --> 00:56:48,475
莎拉今天又不在家?
Sarah's not in again today?

459
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:37,858
你什么时候回来?
What time will you be back?

460
00:57:38,993 --> 00:57:39,994
我不知道 
I don't know.

461
00:57:48,602 --> 00:57:50,604
如果他回来受审怎么办?
What happens if he's returned for trial?

There's nothing wrong with you  Paddy  mate.

474
00:58:55,269 --> 00:58:56,804
嗯 
Hmm.

475
00:58:56,837 --> 00:58:59,173
你只是在和我们其他人开玩笑 
You're only playing a trick on the rest of us.

476
00:59:03,344 --> 00:59:04,979
你们还有其他歌曲吗?
What other songs do you have?

A blast of <i>The Wild Rover</i> maybe?

479
00:59:20,795 --> 00:59:21,796
好男人 
Good man.

480
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,032
嗯 
Hm.

481
00:59:26,934 --> 00:59:30,638
投诉人等了一个星期才提出报告
The complainant waited a week before making her report

482
00:59:30,671 --> 00:59:34,842
并声称在袭击发生当晚她被跟踪到了当地码头
and claims she was followed down to the local pier on the night of the assault

483
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:38,813
被告随后在那里强奸了她 
and that the defendant subsequently raped her down there.

484
00:59:38,846 --> 00:59:43,117
被告的母亲为他提供了不在场证明，法官 
The defendant's mother has provided him with an alibi  Judge.

485
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:46,620
她重申了她和被告当时在房子里的证词
And she reaffirms the statement that she and the defendant were in the house

486
00:59:46,654 --> 00:59:48,222
在事发当晚的几个小时里，
during the hours of the night in question

487
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:51,158
被告和她一起待在房子里
that the defendant remained in the house with her

488
00:59:51,192 --> 00:59:52,927
在被侵犯的几小时内?
during the hours of the claimed assault?

489
00:59:54,295 --> 00:59:55,963
是的，法官阁下 是的 
I do  Your Honor. Yes.

490
00:59:56,397 --> 00:59:57,698
嗯 
Hmm.

491
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,103
这是一个严重的指控 
This is a serious accusation.

492
01:00:02,136 --> 01:00:05,673
这也是被告第一次出庭 
It's also the first time the defendant has been before the court.

493
01:00:08,008 --> 01:00:10,010
现在我的观点是没有足够的…
Now it's my opinion that there's not enough...

494
01:00:10,044 --> 01:00:13,247
在公诉证据簿上
in the Book of Evidence for the State to prosecute.

495
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,851
有关控罪将发还民进党作进一步指示 
Charges will be remanded back to the DPP for further instructions.

496
01:00:16,884 --> 01:00:20,955
我还认为，这项指控不应提交法庭 
I also believe that this charge should not have been brought before the court.

497
01:00:22,156 --> 01:00:23,891
被告可以离开了 
Uh  the defendant is free to leave.

498
01:00:28,162 --> 01:00:29,196
接下来是什么?
What's next?

499
01:00:30,431 --> 01:00:32,266
文件15日法官 
File 15  Judge.

500
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,869
醉酒和无序 
Drunk and disorderly.

501
01:02:57,444 --> 01:03:00,080
艾琳 过来一下，好吗?
Aileen. Come here a minute  will you?

502
01:03:06,854 --> 01:03:08,255
她最近出勤情况如何?
What's her attendance lately?

503
01:03:12,326 --> 01:03:15,095
16个班中有14个没来 
Fourteen of 16 shifts missed.

504
01:03:15,129 --> 01:03:18,533
我可以把日子补上 拜托 
I can make the days up. Please.

505
01:03:18,566 --> 01:03:20,868
还有谁在同一时间翘了班吗?
Has anyone else missed a shift in the same time?

506
01:03:22,637 --> 01:03:25,439
你应该让我们知道的至少，打电话请病假 
You could have let us know at least  you know  called in sick.

507
01:03:27,074 --> 01:03:28,475
但我必须让你走，姑娘 
But I have to let you go  girl.

508
01:03:34,248 --> 01:03:35,349
你是对的 丹尼斯 
You're right  Dennis.

509
01:03:37,985 --> 01:03:40,454
我应该让你知道我发生了什么 
I should've let you know what's been happening with me.

510
01:03:42,189 --> 01:03:44,058
这是个错误，对吧?
That was the mistake  yeah?

511
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,329
不过这对你来说很方便，不是吗?
It's all very convenient for you  though  isn't it?

512
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:52,900
弗朗西的生蚝袋和其他东西，
Between Francie's oyster bags and everything else

513
01:03:52,933 --> 01:03:54,468
每个人都他妈的闭着眼睛 
everyone's got their fucking eyes closed.

514
01:03:58,138 --> 01:03:59,607
等等，等一下 
Wait  hang on a second.

515
01:04:02,443 --> 01:04:03,444
莎拉?
Sarah?

516
01:04:05,379 --> 01:04:07,381
那牡蛎袋呢，莎拉?
What about the oyster bags  Sarah?

517
01:04:14,488 --> 01:04:16,423
来吧，伙计们，集中注意力，回到工作上 
Come on lads  focus  back on the work.

518
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:24,566
她说弗兰西的牡蛎是什么意思，艾琳?
What does she mean about Francie's oysters  Aileen?

519
01:04:27,101 --> 01:04:28,102
回家了 
Go home.

520
01:04:29,169 --> 01:04:30,904
-什么?-回家吧 
-What? -Go home for the day.

521
01:04:51,058 --> 01:04:52,326
奥斯卡 爱 
Oscar  love.

522
01:04:54,294 --> 01:04:57,498
你不能瞒着我就把他从日托所带走 
You can't just take him out of daycare without telling me.

523
01:04:57,532 --> 01:04:58,932
他不是你儿子 
He's not your son.

524
01:05:00,334 --> 01:05:02,236
我不想让你再照顾他了 
I don't want you looking after him anymore.

525
01:05:02,269 --> 01:05:04,238
他妈的 艾琳 她还是他的祖母 
Fuck's sake  Erin. She's still his grandmother.

526
01:05:05,607 --> 01:05:08,208
如果你真的和她坐在一起
If you'd actually sit with her

527
01:05:08,242 --> 01:05:10,444
你不可能这么轻易地否认发生了什么，艾琳 
you wouldn't be able to deny what happened so easily  Aileen.

528
01:05:10,477 --> 01:05:13,380
-对她宽容点 ——没有 
- Go easy on her. - No.

529
01:05:13,414 --> 01:05:15,382
妈的，她得听我说 
For fuck's sake  she needs to hear it.

530
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:25,693
我会和她谈谈的 
I'll talk to her.

531
01:05:52,453 --> 01:05:54,121
你对他一定要小心 
You have to be careful with him.

532
01:06:17,377 --> 01:06:21,281
莎拉在这里的时候，这里是艾琳的房间 
And all the time that Sarah was in here  when it was Erin's room.

533
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:34,361
我以前常拿你们俩跟她妈妈开玩笑，
I used to joke with her mother about the two of you

534
01:06:34,394 --> 01:06:35,597
我们会成为亲家 
that we'd be in-laws.

535
01:07:11,164 --> 01:07:13,166
她在牡蛎袋的事上撒谎了吗，艾琳?
Was she lying about the oyster bags  Aileen?

536
01:07:16,336 --> 01:07:19,473
我得先让你接电话直到我弄清楚到底是怎么回事 
I'm gonna have to put you on the line until I figure out what the story is.

537
01:07:23,277 --> 01:07:24,612
禁令的解除 
Moratorium's been lifted.

538
01:07:25,747 --> 01:07:27,615
疯狂的几个星期 
Be a mad few weeks.

539
01:07:27,649 --> 01:07:30,284
可能得多雇几个人手了 
Might have to hire a few more hands.

540
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:44,732
于是这个故事传开了，
So the story went round

541
01:07:44,766 --> 01:07:46,568
几个月来，人们都以为他妻子死了
and for months  people thought the wife died

542
01:07:46,601 --> 01:07:49,804
因为她为了救火鸡掉进了井里 
'cause she'd fallen down the well tryin' to save the turkey.

543
01:07:49,837 --> 01:07:51,706
那个守卫是个聪明的家伙 
It was some clever prick  the guard.

544
01:07:51,739 --> 01:07:54,576

The way I used to listen to my mother at nights

679
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:12,292
在爸爸生气的时候抱着他上床 
carrying Dad down to bed when he'd be pissed.

680
01:28:15,029 --> 01:28:17,497
听到她那晚之后四处走动，
Hearing her moving around the rest of the night then

681
01:28:18,398 --> 01:28:19,767
独自哭泣 
crying away to herself.

682
01:28:21,536 --> 01:28:23,638
我只是躺在自己的房间里 
Me just lying there in my own room.

683
01:28:28,109 --> 01:28:31,311
20年前，我还能听到他们的回音 
Twenty years ago  and I can still hear their echo.

684
01:28:43,124 --> 01:28:46,027
我想这附近的每栋房子都有同样的鬼魂 
I suppose every house around here has the same ghosts.

685
01:28:51,732 --> 01:28:55,770
妈妈很自豪能把这所房子留给我 
Mom was so proud of the fact that she was able to leave me this house.

686
01:29:01,108 --> 01:29:03,376
我会在她死后住在这里
I'd live here after she did

687
01:29:05,012 --> 01:29:08,916
等等……直到潮水把它冲走 
and so on... until the tide takes it.

688
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:21,529
以前我总是在你家醒来，艾琳…
All the times I used to wake up in your house  Aileen...

689
01:29:24,497 --> 01:29:26,133
布莱恩躺在我旁边的床上 
Brian in the bed beside me.

690
01:29:31,172 --> 01:29:33,941
同样的风让我每晚睡不着觉 
That same wind keeping me awake every night.

691
01:29:40,681 --> 01:29:42,950
是不是他的声音一直萦绕在我心头……
Is it the sound of him that's haunting me...

692
01:29:44,151 --> 01:29:45,953
和其他鬼魂一起吗?
with all these other ghosts?

693
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:51,058
过去的雷声袭来 
The thunder of pasts getting in.

694
01:29:51,092 --> 01:29:53,995
因为突然之间，我…
Because all of a sudden  I...

695
01:29:56,463 --> 01:29:57,732
我不知道我在哪里 
I don't know where I am.

696
01:30:01,636 --> 01:30:04,805
好像这房子和它所有的历史都不是我的 
As if this house and all its history wasn't mine.
