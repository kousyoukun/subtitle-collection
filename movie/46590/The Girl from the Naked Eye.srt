00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,081
<i>Sandy  always hope it rains ...</ i></i>

2
00:01:01,282 --> 00:01:02,879
<i> And now we know why ...</ i></i>

3
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,384
<i> When I asked her,
I never said no. </ i></i>

4
00:01:11,785 --> 00:01:15,310
<i> Now she just smiled. </ i></i>

5
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:21,366
<i> Now, I understand. </ i></i>

6
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:28,791
<i> I wanted to be seen the rain
of tonight, Sandy. </ i></i>

7
00:02:46,592 --> 00:02:49,174
You said that when you are here,
she was already dead.

8
00:02:49,275 --> 00:02:50,807
How long?

9
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,843
How long did you stay in apartment
before calling the police?

10
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,187
I do not remember.

11
00:02:59,188 --> 00:03:02,359
You do not know who had
to be tonight?

12
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,878
I told you that I came and found a
on foot.

13
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,527
How long you know?

14
00:03:10,028 --> 00:03:13,118
About two and a half months.

15
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:17,954
Do you mind if get less and
on to the police station?

16
00:03:19,355 --> 00:03:22,760
- Why?
- And we just ... talk.

17
00:03:28,461 --> 00:03:30,600
<i> I called the police after
I found Sandy. </ i></i>

18
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:33,214
<i> I had to think twice
before they do. </ i></i>

19
00:03:33,249 --> 00:03:36,657
Sandy Wright. Born and raised
in Springfield.

20
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,415
Look good.

21
00:03:40,316 --> 00:03:42,893
Her parents reported her to the "People
missing "three months ago.

22
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:51,534
So ... I have no reason
been a murder?

23
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:53,859
Why did it kill?

24
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,013
Maybe because i fuck
from time to time.

25
00:03:56,014 --> 00:03:57,574
It was just a buddy, right?

26
00:03:57,575 --> 00:04:02,528
Were passed on her list of friends.
Also have 6 friends.

27
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:04,090
That's her job.

28
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:06,193
What does it yet?

29
00:04:06,194 --> 00:04:08,824
To escape the world,
still need money.

30
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:11,578
Sell ??candy at the mall.
Can I go now?

31
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:21,325
<i> "Naked Eye" ...
my second home. </ i></i>

<i> place where men come to throw money
in Pitipoance and cheap whiskey. </ i></i>

33

<i> those detectives could not prove anything,

34

He takes care of these girls. </ I></i>

35
00:04:43,337 --> 00:04:46,356
<i> And most importantly is that Simon
Sandy was last night. </ i></i>

36
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:52,662
- Honey! What are you doing?
- Okay. But you?

37
00:04:52,663 --> 00:04:53,958
- You all right?
- Yes.

38
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:55,628
Come here.

39
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,169
- What did I say about breaks?
- Simon, I just got here.

40
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,669
You just got here. Time to go back
to work. Give it to me, come on.

41
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,618
- Come, let's go.
- Did you know that Jake is here?

42
00:05:03,619 --> 00:05:05,641
- Jake? Seriously?
- Yes.

43
00:05:05,642 --> 00:05:08,474
Great. Move your ass back
to work. Come on! Let's go!

44
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,759
Go, go!

45
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,508
You pay to smoke in here!

46
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:15,265
Bad Bitch!

47
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:42,757
Roxy!

48
00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:46,872
Suck your belly.
You look like a hippo.

49
00:05:55,573 --> 00:05:56,889
Miles ...

50
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,628
- What are you there?
- Who?

51
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:02,102
Who the hell do you think I mean?
The Jake.

52
00:06:03,403 --> 00:06:04,341
I do not know ...

53
00:06:04,942 --> 00:06:06,602
Give him hell out.

54
00:06:06,703 --> 00:06:09,571
<i> I have never seen daylight
since I started working for Simon. </ i></i>

55
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:12,701
<i> But as I met Sandy. </ i></i>

56
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:21,187
What about gambling?
David told me that you left her dead.

57
00:06:21,588 --> 00:06:23,048
I gave up baths.

58
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,049
That's why you're here.

59
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,428
I heard that you are looking for someone
with muscle. Pay well and provide a meal.

60
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:34,156
This is not allowed weapons.
You have to just do a good job.

61
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:40,577
In this club, I offer private dances
my clients.

62
00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:43,563
You will be ... protection.

63
00:06:44,364 --> 00:06:49,485
Take care of the meetings, stop time and
make sure that my money is actually received at the end.

64
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:02,217
I do not want.

65
00:07:03,518 --> 00:07:06,373
If you did not come here to drink, Jake,
What the hell are you looking here?

66
00:07:07,274 --> 00:07:09,060
Need to talk to Simon.

67
00:07:11,261 --> 00:07:12,778
It's a girl, is not it?

68
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,643
He is not in too good a provision
this evening.

69
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:23,273
Tell Simon that if the state is not
improves, mine is worse.

70
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:38,145
Do me a favor.
Go and take a walk.

71
00:07:45,946 --> 00:07:48,257
Jake, what the hell are you doing here?

72
00:07:48,658 --> 00:07:53,136
It's your day free. Should you occupy
with your hobbies.

73
00:07:53,137 --> 00:07:55,720
The Bay ...

74
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:04,873
Drink?

75
00:08:08,374 --> 00:08:09,737
Some rontanele?

76
00:08:15,138 --> 00:08:17,684
- What is it?
- What happened last night with Sandy?

77
00:08:18,985 --> 00:08:22,111
Detectives me head fucked all day.
Now you?

78
00:08:22,112 --> 00:08:25,159
- It was my friendly fighter.
- Dude ...

79
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,728
Everyone knows that you and Sandy
were not just friends.

80
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:29,504
All are wrong.

81
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:36,730
At the end of the day, Sandy was a prostitute.
You ought to know better that.

82
00:08:36,931 --> 00:08:38,735
I know it as we know it.

83
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:47,393
You believe that there is something about
My daughters, of whom you know, and I do not.

84
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:51,655
Who drove it last night?

85
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:55,499
Nobody led her. He said he would
call a taxi.

86
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,555
- Nonsense.
- Do not blame me, Jake.

87
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:01,966
You should have a drive.
What the hell happened there?

88
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,531
Who has seen it?

89
00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:15,204
- Yes. Anne ...
- What the hell, Simon? I waited all day.

90
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:18,726
- Do not answer the phone ...
- I can not talk now.

91
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,166
So shut the fuck up!

92
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:25,578
- Simon, are empty.
- Well, honey, see you tonight.

93
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:31,590
We boys dealing with it, Jake.

94
00:09:31,991 --> 00:09:33,352
Where is your notebook?

95
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:36,280
I now notebook with me, OK?
Perhaps it's in my jacket at home.

96
00:09:36,281 --> 00:09:39,162
- Did you bring it tomorrow.
- Let us take now.

97
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:45,279
It's late, okay?
My children sleep.

98
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,379
To hell with you your children!
Bring notebook now!

99
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,929
Look at you ...
You are pathetic!

100
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,231
Do you think it will give you my notebook
to arrange all my customers?

101
00:09:56,232 --> 00:09:57,593
Are you nuts?

102
00:09:59,094 --> 00:10:02,399
In terms of emotional
I understand, okay?

103
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,912
But you must be smart.

104
00:10:04,513 --> 00:10:06,855
Believe me, it'll catch on
this villain.

105
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,908
But they do it in my style.

106
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:17,447
Try not only to protect you, right?

107
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:20,401
Now, I'm your only friend.

108
00:10:25,502 --> 00:10:26,673
Look ...

109
00:10:28,174 --> 00:10:29,904
And I feel just like you.

110
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:31,847
That is all we care about Sandy.

111
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:35,535
But now you have to go home
and to rest.

112
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,429
And you go out of here.

113
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,253
<i> Simon knew more,
but do not tell me. </ i></i>

114
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:55,807
<i>His  cared the least to

115

116

the same. </ i></i>

117
00:11:04,185 --> 00:11:05,348
<i> But Sandy was different. </ i></i>

118
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:10,030
- You must be Jake, my driver.
- Oh, yes. Have a seat.

119
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:13,238
I'm Sandy.

120
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:20,320
- What drink?
- Only water.

121
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:23,612
I quit drinking.
I create problems.

122
00:11:24,113 --> 00:11:26,006
If you do not drink, then
what are good?

123
00:11:30,007 --> 00:11:31,220
Beautiful.

124
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:34,825
Beauty occurs when
look inside.

125
00:11:36,126 --> 00:11:37,446
How old are you? 18?

126
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,646
Are quite mature.

127
00:11:42,147 --> 00:11:44,012
Are you ready to make some money
easy?

128
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:47,195
Not easy ...

129

Now or never, baby.

137
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:49,127
It becomes too hard. I go out.

138
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:50,718
What would you, Jake?

139
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:56,200
What the hell is that?

140
00:12:57,201 --> 00:12:58,456
Key to Bentley.

141
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:00,944
You think they're crazy?

142
00:13:01,945 --> 00:13:05,218
As far as I know, you are the craziest
villain here.

143
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,755
Tell me I am wrong.

144
00:13:14,156 --> 00:13:16,179
Jake, you're wrong.

145
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,898
Oh, shit ...

146
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:31,930
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!

147
00:13:32,431 --> 00:13:35,058
Man, 4 fuckin' 3?

148
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,308
Fuck, Jake!

149
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,932
And I sat in bed at home.

150
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,111
I relax myself.

151
00:14:42,912 --> 00:14:47,327
When I got a call saying that I
that car you've lost me.

152
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:50,416
My most beautiful Bentley.

153
00:14:51,617 --> 00:14:53,468
At a poker game!

154
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:59,020
I'm sorry ...
I'll pay it.

155
00:15:02,021 --> 00:15:04,122
I am sure you gonna do it.

156
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:20,303
Keep an eye on Jake.
I do not want to come around.

157
00:15:20,304 --> 00:15:22,592
And after I leave,
Bring me some cigarettes.

158
00:15:35,593 --> 00:15:37,875
<i> Simon goes to see her Angela. </ i></i>

159
00:15:37,876 --> 00:15:41,557
<i>Before reaching home 
the wife was fat. </ i></i>

160
00:15:44,058 --> 00:15:46,996
<i> Simon built a building in the center,
he has turned it into a brothel. </ i></i>

161
00:15:50,397 --> 00:15:52,540
<i> And he gave Angela an apartment
there. </ i></i>

162
00:15:53,341 --> 00:15:56,352
<i> In fact, it was the first girl I
led, </ i></i>

163
00:15:56,353 --> 00:15:58,774
<i> before Simon and a rise in status
No.1 mistress. </ i></i>

164
00:16:01,575 --> 00:16:03,098
<i> Angela is a whore. </ i></i>

165
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,470
Yes?

166
00:16:07,471 --> 00:16:10,466
What do you mean "yes"? Open the damn door.
I freeze balls.

167
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:18,134
Are you kidding me?

168
00:16:49,135 --> 00:16:50,810
- Are you ready for this?
- Yes.

169
00:16:56,011 --> 00:16:57,423
Pull my hair.

170
00:16:58,924 --> 00:17:00,190
Beat my ass!

171
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:03,046
Pull my hair!
Fuck me!

172
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:10,611
What chick ...

173
00:17:11,112 --> 00:17:13,819
- Are you serious, man?
- I have nothing with you, Johnny.

174
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,652
You can not do that.

175
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:21,840
Cracks my ass!

176
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,031
You can shut the fuck
for a second!

177
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:28,116
- What is it?
- I ... we can fuck in peace?

178
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:33,242
You know what ... just talking, Simon.

179
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:35,102
- Yes, I know.
- Just words.

180
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:40,426
OK, just that talking too much!
I could do it easily and quietly?

181
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,695
It's nothing. We find
on someone else.

182
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,023
- I'll find someone else?
- Yes.

183
00:17:45,324 --> 00:17:47,538
Seriously? Fuck you!

184
00:17:47,739 --> 00:17:49,720
- I fuck you!
- I fuck you!

185
00:17:49,721 --> 00:17:51,208
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

186
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:53,207
Damn!

187
00:17:53,508 --> 00:17:54,832
What the hell?

188
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:02,150
- You go.
- That's me.

189
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,377
How the hell did you get here?

190
00:18:07,778 --> 00:18:09,774
Notebook, Simon!
I want that name!

191
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:12,067
Now do it on the detective, Jake?

192
00:18:12,268 --> 00:18:13,407
Get it bitch!

193
00:18:18,908 --> 00:18:20,398
Ungrateful shit you are.

194
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,781
I gave you a job, I gave money.

195
00:18:23,782 --> 00:18:25,261
And so I reward you?

196
00:18:25,262 --> 00:18:28,471
I think they're crap?
What the hell is wrong with you?

197
00:18:30,572 --> 00:18:32,040
You can not do, Simon?

198
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:36,572
Fuck you.
Let me handle me.

199
00:18:37,173 --> 00:18:40,624
I see that you do.
Just eating shit in your mouth.

200
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,535
Jake ...

201
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:48,665
Idiot, hit women?

202
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:52,127
Yes ... What the hell?

203
00:18:52,528 --> 00:18:53,965
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

204
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:54,924
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

205
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,925
Fuck you!

206
00:18:57,126 --> 00:19:00,373
- Hey, you're done!
- Do not touch him hell!

207
00:19:05,374 --> 00:19:06,493
Jake ...

208
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:20,488
Why do that, Jake?
For a slut who fucks?

209
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:25,094
Hi, back. You guys stay on the stairs
and cover each floor.

210
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:29,655
- Johnny, are you okay?
- To hell with Jake. I will kill him.

211
00:19:29,656 --> 00:19:31,038
Easy, killer.

212
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,932
And I would just kill.

213
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:38,585
Last chance.

214
00:19:40,886 --> 00:19:41,953
Fuck you!

215
00:20:04,254 --> 00:20:06,201
Try figure that,
bastard.

216
00:20:06,202 --> 00:20:09,437
What are you doing, Johnny? Put the gun down.
It's Jake.

217
00:20:09,438 --> 00:20:12,625
- To calm down. He has got to threaten me.
- Fuck you!

218
00:20:14,026 --> 00:20:15,319
I do not want to hurt you.

219
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,209
Fuck you.
Take and try.

220
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,180
Yes, and as a draw
a fag.

221
00:20:21,181 --> 00:20:22,526
Shut the fuck up, Sammy.

222
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:26,044
Johnny, put the gun down.
Let's see what Jake has to say.

223
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:29,088
Look ... I had to talk to Sammy.
Let's see what happened with Sandy.

224
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:32,053
But now all is well. You can
go to Simon to get you.

225
00:20:33,154 --> 00:20:34,856
All is well.

226
00:20:35,357 --> 00:20:36,485
Quench yourself.

227
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:42,488
- Put the gun down.
- Put it down.

228
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:51,424
Fuck you, Jake!

229
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:06,855
Please do not make me sick!

230
00:21:37,056 --> 00:21:39,085
Come on! Come on!
It's down!

231
00:21:42,086 --> 00:21:43,558
Baby, you're so beautiful!

232
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:46,553
Thank you, darling, you know how to do
a girl feel good!

233
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:50,483
Jake, are you crazy?
What the hell?

234
00:21:50,884 --> 00:21:52,588
I'm in trouble.
Help me, dear.

235
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:55,326
And what should I do?

236
00:21:56,027 --> 00:21:58,890
- Samantha, did you see Jake?
- Open once!

237
00:21:58,891 --> 00:22:00,870
No, I have seen.
What the hell is happening?

238
00:22:00,871 --> 00:22:01,871
It's a mistake!

239
00:22:01,872 --> 00:22:03,486
- Where is Jake?
- I do not know.

240
00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:04,663
Damn!

241
00:22:06,664 --> 00:22:08,783
Gagico, did you see Jake?

242
00:22:08,784 --> 00:22:10,285
Oh, honey ... I'm in the middle
of stuff.

243
00:22:11,386 --> 00:22:12,569
Oh, baby ... yeah!

244
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,814
Come hell out!

245
00:22:15,815 --> 00:22:16,975
Let's go, man!

246
00:22:17,276 --> 00:22:18,465
You have a naughty ass, bitch.

247
00:22:18,466 --> 00:22:20,171
- Come on!
- Fuck you!

248
00:22:22,172 --> 00:22:23,509
Oh, baby ...

249
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,051
Jake, Jake ...

250
00:22:27,052 --> 00:22:28,416
Thank you, Wendy.

251
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:33,678
Damn!

252
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:48,012
- Good.
- Good.

253
00:22:49,313 --> 00:22:52,364
- You Jake, is not it?
- Yes.

254
00:22:57,165 --> 00:22:59,012
I'm sorry for Sandy.

255
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,169
Thank you.

256
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,256
Police!

257
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:15,017
Leave him alone!

258
00:23:36,618 --> 00:23:38,838
- Are you OK?
- Yes ...

259
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:41,114
Thank you for your help.

260
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,354
Fucking bastard!

261
00:25:09,555 --> 00:25:12,655
<i>Damn ... That  would have had
to happen. </ i></i>

262
00:25:14,756 --> 00:25:16,481
<i> But now I can not return. </ i></i>

263
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:20,184
<i> is a matter of time until
they will lay hands on me. </ i></i>

264
00:25:25,085 --> 00:25:28,066
- Where did you get it on Sandy?
- No, it's a new girl.

265
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:30,267
Here it comes.

266
00:25:30,268 --> 00:25:31,268
See you later.

267
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:44,746
- How was it?
- He gave me money.

268
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:48,495
To fuck you!

269
00:26:00,996 --> 00:26:02,938
What the hell is wrong with you?

270
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:07,528
Do not like? Do not you satisfied?
Do not get fucked pretty good?

271
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:09,762
Yes! I fucked very well.

272
00:26:09,763 --> 00:26:11,239
Then, why fuck?

273
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,035
You see, when I fuck her, fuck me one thousand
and I pull my head.

274
00:26:14,036 --> 00:26:17,320
It's a game of shooting
you need to be ready.

275
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:19,295
What the hell are you on here?

276
00:26:20,096 --> 00:26:23,963
What the hell is this? Litter. Dyno Club?
Who the hell uses that?

277
00:26:24,364 --> 00:26:26,935
- I'm sorry.
- Shut the fuck up.

278
00:26:27,136 --> 00:26:29,826
Get the fuck out of here.

279
00:26:38,327 --> 00:26:39,572
Mike ...

280
00:26:40,373 --> 00:26:44,490
Yes, I know. 5 old, right?
Look ... pay them tomorrow.

281
00:26:45,191 --> 00:26:48,304
What the hell do you think?
That get drunk every night?

282
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:50,778
They run on these whores ...

283
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,334
Look ... I gotta go,
well?

284
00:26:57,435 --> 00:26:59,050
I'm sorry.

285
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,701
Why are you such a jerk?

286
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,039
I am wretched now?
I got money.

287
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,275
Do not respect the girls
they drive.

288
00:27:05,676 --> 00:27:07,906
If you fuck men ...
Why do you think you are?

289
00:27:08,107 --> 00:27:10,474
I do not know and do not want
you know ...

290
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:13,282
But if it do, then you
just like me.

291
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:19,609
What is it? Drugs, sex or your father
beat you every night when you were a kid?

292
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:24,308
This is my first night.
How long do it, Jake?

293
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:29,664
Sorry ... just that dude
me out of my mind ...

294
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,417
And I just escaped, Sam ...

295
00:27:35,918 --> 00:27:38,578
I will do well, OK?

296
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:44,056
Come on ... Let me make you buy
a milkshake or something ...

297
00:27:46,757 --> 00:27:50,148
<i> She was right.
Who was I to judge? </ I></i>

298
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:04,885
King of Macedonia has paid the most expensive
prostitute in the world.

299
00:28:04,886 --> 00:28:07,320
He paid his mistress with
50 thalers.

300
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:08,970
How is that?

301
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:11,989
Around about 70 million
dollars in today's money.

302
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,580
If you do this to get rich,
going to be disappointed.

303
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:31,086
I do not know because ... what else
I could do.

304
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:38,054
I can understand.
But do not lock it.

305
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:44,243
But you ...
Are you stuck?

306
00:28:51,744 --> 00:28:53,605
I used to play games of chance.

307
00:28:54,806 --> 00:28:57,466
I lost a lot of money for people
to whom did you want to lose money.

308
00:29:00,467 --> 00:29:01,637
How much money?

309
00:29:03,438 --> 00:29:04,988
One hundred thousand.

310
00:29:07,389 --> 00:29:08,964
Money ...

311
00:29:27,965 --> 00:29:31,196
- You look like hell.
- I feel like hell.

312
00:29:31,197 --> 00:29:32,602
But you were lucky.

313
00:29:34,782 --> 00:29:36,143
So what happened?

314
00:29:40,344 --> 00:29:42,136
Jake loses his mind.

315
00:29:43,237 --> 00:29:47,204
He came here, stole my notebook
and shot everywhere.

316
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:50,764
- Does your notebook?
- Yes.

317
00:29:51,465 --> 00:29:53,045
Then Jake is dead.

318
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:58,406
Hold on ... do not want to be killed, right?

319
00:29:58,907 --> 00:30:00,561
You can not arrest him or something
like that?

320
00:30:01,662 --> 00:30:03,815
Are police lieutenant for 10 years,

321
00:30:03,816 --> 00:30:07,055
and I'm going to go to jail
because you are weak guy.

322
00:30:07,756 --> 00:30:12,715
Do not ask, but I say ...
that my partner should not kill him.

323
00:30:12,716 --> 00:30:15,801
Not your partner.
Let me be clear about this.

324
00:30:16,202 --> 00:30:19,571
I pay well to take away
copoii you. So.

325
00:30:19,572 --> 00:30:22,743
On a personal level, I would not piss no
you if you burn in a fire.

326
00:30:23,844 --> 00:30:25,520
So why should we kill him?

327
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:32,657
First, a girl found dead
in your apartment.

328
00:30:32,658 --> 00:30:35,819
Second, the city walks a fool
seeking to take revenge.

329
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,047
And thirdly,
but not least,

330
00:30:38,048 --> 00:30:40,690
this is now a writing fool,

331
00:30:40,691 --> 00:30:44,628
it says that I fucked this girl
dead 2 times a week

332
00:30:44,629 --> 00:30:45,629
the last two months.

333
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,582
How many charges does it mean?

334
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:49,835
Trafficking in minors for prostitution,

335
00:30:49,836 --> 00:30:55,167
restraint and ... no less important,
crime.

336
00:30:55,368 --> 00:30:58,055
- I did not kill her.
- Then who?

337
00:30:58,556 --> 00:30:59,905
How the hell should I know?

338
00:30:59,996 --> 00:31:03,476
When you are fucking better, because
Let me tell you something:

339
00:31:03,477 --> 00:31:06,623
if this notebook go elsewhere
you nor I can protect.

340
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:17,985
Look ... I will take back
notebook.

341
00:31:17,986 --> 00:31:18,846
Well?

342
00:31:19,347 --> 00:31:21,944
A hell to pay him some money to Jake.
He's a reasonable guy.

343
00:31:21,945 --> 00:31:23,562
Jake, reasonable guy?

344
00:31:26,363 --> 00:31:28,742
We forget that I was ridiculed.

345
00:31:31,543 --> 00:31:36,323
All right. If you want to kill,
kill him.

346
00:31:38,224 --> 00:31:39,766
That's the best.

347
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:02,389
What are those?

348
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,220
It's a game with handcuffs, dear.

349
00:32:04,521 --> 00:32:06,646
- Do not do that.
- Do not worry.

350
00:32:06,647 --> 00:32:08,885
- No!
- Yes? What?

351
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:10,926
Get off me!

352
00:32:11,227 --> 00:32:14,251
FBI! Federal Inspector!

353
00:32:18,252 --> 00:32:19,717
You gotta be kidding.

354
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:21,884
Who the hell are you calling?

355
00:32:21,885 --> 00:32:24,722
- Bad Bitch.
- The game is over, baby.

356
00:32:24,723 --> 00:32:27,105
- Leave.
- Get off me!

357
00:32:27,106 --> 00:32:28,553
Come on, calm down.

358
00:32:28,554 --> 00:32:30,153
Only now is real, baby.

359
00:32:30,154 --> 00:32:32,174
- Keep it.
- Come on.

360
00:32:33,575 --> 00:32:35,779
- Shit.
- Keep it well.

361
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,697
Open her legs!

362
00:32:40,698 --> 00:32:41,698
Stop! Please!

363
00:32:41,699 --> 00:32:42,699
What the hell ...

364
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,613
Are you a cop?
Her boyfriend?

365
00:32:46,614 --> 00:32:47,614
What?

366
00:33:01,515 --> 00:33:03,418
My finger!

367
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,807
It is now my finger.

368
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:08,273
Let's go.

369
00:33:11,174 --> 00:33:12,683
Did they hurt?

370
00:33:17,284 --> 00:33:18,402
Well ...

371
00:33:21,803 --> 00:33:23,239
What?

372
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,584
Let me give you something to drink, OK?

373
00:33:34,385 --> 00:33:36,918
<i> Sandy was strong in its own way. </ i></i>

374
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:40,199
<i> But she did not belong to this world. </ i></i>

375
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,421
It's your drink?

376
00:33:52,922 --> 00:33:55,351
Try, but I had a
hard week.

377
00:34:05,852 --> 00:34:07,227
Thank you for what
you did.

378
00:34:07,528 --> 00:34:09,244
Leave not a big deal.

379
00:34:10,245 --> 00:34:13,089
I would not let anyone hurt you,
so ...

380
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,611
And my father said that ...

381
00:34:21,112 --> 00:34:23,271
You know ... both are the same.

382
00:34:24,172 --> 00:34:27,499
Both sell our bodies for
some money cursed.

383
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,023
But I am not this ...
Not like me.

384
00:34:31,524 --> 00:34:34,034
It's like ... no you are not so.

385
00:34:34,235 --> 00:34:36,067
It's just a job.

386
00:34:36,268 --> 00:34:37,856
I am very good at this job,
so ...

387
00:34:40,257 --> 00:34:43,175
You should not concerned about the villains
like the time you will do the job.

388
00:34:53,576 --> 00:34:55,219
Dance with me?

389
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,161
Come on, dance with me.

390
00:34:59,162 --> 00:35:01,116
Come on!

391
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:19,605
Why do this?

392
00:35:22,806 --> 00:35:25,115
Why sit miss me?

393
00:35:25,816 --> 00:35:27,115
You can do anything you want.

394
00:35:35,016 --> 00:35:37,298
My mother's boyfriend
tried to rape me.

395
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:41,443
And ... when I told my mother,
she believed me.

396
00:35:43,444 --> 00:35:44,999
So I went.

397
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,889
When I got here, I
$ 20 in your pocket.

398
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:54,366
And I could not rent an apartment, for
I was too young, without a job ...

399
00:35:58,567 --> 00:36:03,136
And when I met Simon,
he gave me what he called:

400
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,943
"The biggest career opportunity."

401
00:36:07,544 --> 00:36:10,486
And ... I got here.

402
00:36:12,187 --> 00:36:14,007
I did not let any family
in this world ...

403
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:17,572
I who disappoint.

404
00:36:19,173 --> 00:36:20,961
We remain trapped
in this world.

405
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:25,323
I will not stay blocked ...
I promise that.

406
00:36:27,424 --> 00:36:32,505
Once on my feet, I go
faster than you say "fish".

407
00:36:33,906 --> 00:36:36,101
That's a problem, since
no place to sleep.

408
00:36:49,902 --> 00:36:52,099
- Good.
- Good.

409
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,715
- Do you mind if I stay?
- No.

410
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:03,016
So, how are you?
You look tired.

411
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:06,414
And I'm tired.
Should I go home.

412
00:37:06,415 --> 00:37:10,426
I would not want to walk alone back home.
This city is full of strange.

413
00:37:11,227 --> 00:37:12,350
I have no money.

414
00:37:15,551 --> 00:37:18,496
- What are you doing?
- I think.

415
00:37:18,897 --> 00:37:22,492
- What?
- How to solve a problem that I have.

416
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:27,832
- You're a detective or something?
- No.

417
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:30,344
I could help.

418
00:37:30,945 --> 00:37:34,041
I am very good at mysteries. Read
mystery books when I was little.

419
00:37:34,942 --> 00:37:39,119
- How to solve mysteries?
- I do not know. What mystery is this?

420
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,612
It's a mystery policeman. Let's say ...
Your friend was killed.

421
00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:50,818
- Your boyfriend was killed?
- I like something ...

422
00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:52,573
Leave, I gotta go.

423
00:37:52,874 --> 00:37:56,257
Wait. It can help you.

424
00:38:00,158 --> 00:38:02,775
Sounds like a list of suspects, right?

425
00:38:04,376 --> 00:38:08,971
Why not phone your friend and looking
see who called him the day he died?

426
00:38:09,172 --> 00:38:11,089
But if you do not find the phone?

427
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,228
Why not call him?

428
00:38:15,029 --> 00:38:19,216
<i> Bingo. An indication from a
chick in the club. </ i></i>

429
00:38:23,817 --> 00:38:27,749
<i> must begin to use my head.
You have to check Sandy's place. </ I></i>

430
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,715
<i>Simon  Sandy gave him a second phone
for the job. </ i></i>

431
00:39:08,716 --> 00:39:10,525
The report, there is a situation here.

432
00:39:47,026 --> 00:39:50,163
Hey, hey! Police, get back!
Keep your hands above your head!

433
00:39:50,164 --> 00:39:51,164
I take it.

434
00:40:08,165 --> 00:40:11,239
8-2-0-0 ...

435
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,263
0-0 ...

436
00:40:25,864 --> 00:40:27,077
Edward Baits.

437
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:33,516
<i>Edward  Baits, a programmer who has created 
porn sites about foot fetishes. </ i></i>

438
00:40:34,217 --> 00:40:36,891
<i>He loved sucks ,when Sandy was 
dirty . </ i></i>

439
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:40,096
Yes, honey, more. Yes!
More.

440
00:40:40,797 --> 00:40:44,309
You know where I could find
Edward ...

441
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,826
- Oh, yes ...
- Yes?

442
00:40:46,827 --> 00:40:48,385
Oh, yes ...

443
00:40:51,386 --> 00:40:54,189
- Who the hell are you?
- What are you doing, Jake?

444
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,639
- Get out.
- I call security.

445
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,393
What do you want? Here.
You want money? I have.

446
00:41:05,106 --> 00:41:07,006
I want the laptop?
Merry Christmas.

447
00:41:08,907 --> 00:41:13,326
<i> already knew that he killed her.
But you may have known something. </ I></i>

448
00:41:19,827 --> 00:41:22,023
Are you sure? All right.

449
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:26,898
- Who was?
- I called one of the girls. I've found.

450
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:38,496
Please ... Take all for what you came
and go from there.

451
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:42,676
Last night you were a girl.
You know as Tammy.

452
00:41:42,677 --> 00:41:44,130
I do not know what you mean.

453
00:41:44,131 --> 00:41:46,518
You see it every Tuesday
from last month.

454
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,048
I know this because
I was her driver.

455
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:54,733
And what is it? I always treated her well,
I paid well.

456
00:41:54,734 --> 00:41:57,392
- Is dead.
- Dead?

457
00:41:58,393 --> 00:42:01,812
O Lord ...
Do you think I killed her?

458
00:42:03,013 --> 00:42:06,582
- You did?
- Why should I be killed?

459
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:09,113
I have no reason
and killed her.

460
00:42:10,914 --> 00:42:16,592
Jesus Christ! I'm just a
computer engineer, for God!

461
00:42:17,693 --> 00:42:19,550
He said where he was going that night?

462
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:24,002
I did not say anything!
I'm just a customer.

463
00:42:24,903 --> 00:42:27,100
- Think about it, Edward.
- I know nothing!

464
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:28,629
Think!

465
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,381
OK, OK ...

466
00:42:32,982 --> 00:42:34,752
Now I remember.

467
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:41,034
He went to the bathroom
to wash ...

468
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:45,022
And when he left the bathroom,
She said:

469
00:42:45,323 --> 00:42:47,633
"Yes, well, Bobby.
We see the club in 15 minutes ".

470
00:42:47,634 --> 00:42:48,669
Bobby.

471
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:52,894
- Bobby.
- Bobby ...

472
00:42:53,895 --> 00:42:56,810
- Bobby who?
- I do not know. He said only "Bobby".

473
00:42:59,311 --> 00:43:02,098
- Bobby Banks?
- I said!

474
00:43:02,399 --> 00:43:04,008
Think about it, Edward!
Bobby's Banks?

475
00:43:04,009 --> 00:43:05,121
I do not know!

476
00:43:05,822 --> 00:43:07,768
I do not know ...
I do not know ...

477
00:43:18,569 --> 00:43:19,953
Give him hell.

478
00:43:19,954 --> 00:43:21,589
I'll fuck them all.

479
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:24,413
Man, do not know why I care
the bitch.

480
00:43:24,914 --> 00:43:26,226
Fucking bitch.

481
00:43:27,327 --> 00:43:29,528
Let's hit it.

482
00:43:59,229 --> 00:44:01,068
I killed the bastard.

483
00:44:30,569 --> 00:44:32,759
Do not know what Jack wanted,
is not it?

484
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:37,061
I do not know ... I do not know!
I do not know!

485
00:44:41,562 --> 00:44:43,716
<i> I wanted and it protect
Sandy. </ i></i>

486
00:44:45,217 --> 00:44:47,187
<i> I would have her back. </ i></i>

487
00:44:48,588 --> 00:44:52,096
You thought to go back to school?
School you would do well.

488
00:44:52,297 --> 00:44:53,802
It was good.

489
00:44:54,103 --> 00:44:56,081
Yes? What was your time
favorite?

490
00:44:56,882 --> 00:45:00,614
- I did poetry last year.
- Poetry? Seriously?

491
00:45:04,915 --> 00:45:08,454
You know, I do some training ...

492
00:45:08,755 --> 00:45:11,356
It's a place in the center
and is made once a week.

493
00:45:11,857 --> 00:45:14,944
I thought that if you look ...
you could go.

494
00:45:16,345 --> 00:45:18,134
Yes ... And what would that prove?

495
00:45:19,535 --> 00:45:24,591
It would prove nothing, but ... you know ... you could
go to college, to follow the poetry ...

496
00:45:25,992 --> 00:45:29,026
Yes ... It made so much money
of poetry ...

497
00:45:31,327 --> 00:45:32,960
Come on, it's not about money.

498
00:45:33,461 --> 00:45:37,472
- I want to hear a poem of yours.
- What?

499
00:45:38,373 --> 00:45:40,644
Come on, nobody hears us.

500
00:45:41,945 --> 00:45:45,238
- Okay, but do not laugh.
- I laugh again?

501
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:47,644
No ... not really.

502
00:45:49,145 --> 00:45:52,313
- Okay then.
- Okay.

503
00:45:54,814 --> 00:45:57,441
"I fell in love once before you die."

504
00:45:58,142 --> 00:46:00,776
"When my soul glistened
and my eyes were big. "

505
00:46:02,077 --> 00:46:04,644
"But he was young,
and I was like him. "

506
00:46:06,145 --> 00:46:08,440
"The lives of ourselves
they live. "

507
00:46:10,241 --> 00:46:13,323
"But I knew ... I knew that it would not last."

508
00:46:14,824 --> 00:46:17,453
"We could not save
passing month. "

509
00:46:18,554 --> 00:46:20,669
"I looked then
dark skies. "

510
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,680
"And he looked at me with eyes
its lost. "

511
00:46:25,781 --> 00:46:27,775
"Then, my life is over."

512
00:46:27,976 --> 00:46:31,868
"When time, space and
Universe ended. "

513
00:46:40,469 --> 00:46:43,782
- I liked.
- Thanks.

514
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:34,206
Hey, you're not on the list.

515
00:47:34,807 --> 00:47:36,063
I have a message for Mr. Banks.

516
00:47:36,064 --> 00:47:37,829
Mr. Banks does not accept messages,

517
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:40,337
but if I give him,
I have to offer.

518
00:47:40,338 --> 00:47:44,891
- It's personal.
- Of course, Bruce Lee, just give me hell ...

519
00:47:52,092 --> 00:47:55,307
<i>Bobby Banks offered weapons  ...
in the area. </ i></i>

520
00:47:55,308 --> 00:47:57,353
<i> He believes he's a playboy. </ i></i>

521
00:47:57,454 --> 00:48:01,005
<i> Yes, right. Sandy told me that he liked
plastic penises. </ i></i>

522
00:48:01,906 --> 00:48:03,791
How the hell did you get here, boy?

523
00:48:08,392 --> 00:48:09,667
So what you want, Jack?

524
00:48:10,168 --> 00:48:12,981
- Jake.
- OK ...

525
00:48:13,282 --> 00:48:16,426
So what you want, Jake?

526
00:48:20,427 --> 00:48:21,946
Revenge.

527
00:48:21,947 --> 00:48:24,383
Forgot your first orgasm
Sandy?

528
00:48:26,284 --> 00:48:29,193
You are so good that pay
girls to fuck you.

529
00:48:30,794 --> 00:48:32,316
Hey, I do not pay girls
to fuck me.

530
00:48:32,317 --> 00:48:35,659
Pay as you go,
after you fuck, tool.

531
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:39,410
- What did you do?
- What the hell do I do?

532
00:48:43,311 --> 00:48:47,246
- You killed Sandy.
- Sandy is dead?

533
00:48:49,247 --> 00:48:50,685
I know that you were last night
with it.

534
00:48:50,686 --> 00:48:52,854
How the hell can I prove,
Sherlock?

535
00:48:52,855 --> 00:48:56,968
Not all scoundrels manage to cross
all the time.

536
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:03,028
And she has passed on to you?

537
00:49:05,129 --> 00:49:08,722
She wanted a favor ...
so that I provided.

538
00:49:11,123 --> 00:49:14,239
- What favor?
- That's between me and her, yes, Jack?

539
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:19,504
How Sandy is dead, there's between you and
it. You just left you.

540
00:49:19,905 --> 00:49:22,649
- I killed myself.
- Do not believe you.

541
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,161
You're an idiot.

542
00:50:33,662 --> 00:50:34,775
Come on!

543
00:50:53,576 --> 00:50:55,857
These guys are people
Simon.

544
00:50:57,158 --> 00:50:59,511
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

545
00:51:03,012 --> 00:51:06,025
Nice club. I think out
good money here.

546
00:51:07,926 --> 00:51:10,733
Do you think Bobby puts its money in this
night club?

547
00:51:12,134 --> 00:51:15,266
This guy sells weapons.
It's an idiot.

548
00:51:15,867 --> 00:51:17,020
Seriously?

549
00:51:19,321 --> 00:51:22,288
That's why I worry so much
that lead you to guys like him.

550
00:51:24,089 --> 00:51:26,473
Jake, not time.

551
00:51:29,174 --> 00:51:32,865
I know, I'm a shit driver ...
A driver shit.

552
00:51:33,366 --> 00:51:36,284
Columns I remember something.

553
00:51:37,185 --> 00:51:38,922
You are very strange.

554
00:51:43,323 --> 00:51:47,075
- What are you doing?
- Charleston.

555
00:51:47,076 --> 00:51:48,847
Charleston dance know?

556
00:51:48,848 --> 00:51:50,286
I think not.

557
00:51:52,587 --> 00:51:56,844
I wanted to be Joan Crawford,
Josephine Baker.

558
00:51:57,345 --> 00:51:59,842
The film "Our girls dancing."
Hallelujah!

559
00:52:01,443 --> 00:52:06,713
O God, my favorite was ...
Clara Bow.

560
00:52:06,714 --> 00:52:08,597
I loved her.

561
00:52:08,598 --> 00:52:09,680
Who is she?

562
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:11,612
A silent film star.

563
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:14,968
The best film of his
was "It" ("Sex Appeal")

564
00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:18,820
It acts as a seller is
love with her beautiful head.

565
00:52:20,521 --> 00:52:25,406
In another life, he would not have been
interested in it, but it does.

566
00:52:27,107 --> 00:52:29,542
This is because she has sex appeal.

567
00:52:33,143 --> 00:52:37,104
Quality sex appeal ...
who charms others

568
00:52:37,105 --> 00:52:39,748
with its magnetic force ...

569
00:52:43,749 --> 00:52:45,520
You believe that we, Jake?

570
00:52:58,821 --> 00:53:00,035
I take them.

571
00:53:09,136 --> 00:53:11,706
- Has 16 years.
- And?

572
00:53:12,007 --> 00:53:16,990
- I do not know what to think about it.
- I should not feel anything.

573
00:53:18,591 --> 00:53:21,944
Not paying you to feel,
but to drive.

574
00:53:24,345 --> 00:53:25,714
I can not do it.

575
00:53:26,815 --> 00:53:30,658
Look ... kid ran away from home.
There was no one.

576
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:33,701
I found it on the subway,
in the middle of the night.

577
00:53:34,102 --> 00:53:37,710
I put it in an apartment.
Now it's on their feet.

578
00:53:38,111 --> 00:53:40,253
- I am a villain?
- The fuck.

579
00:53:40,854 --> 00:53:45,672
Jake ... We both know that it needs
of this work, it needs money.

580
00:53:45,673 --> 00:53:51,670
- So just drive away. You can do this?
- It's a good girl. Just ...

581
00:53:51,671 --> 00:53:53,755
Just drive the car fucking.

582
00:53:55,156 --> 00:53:57,765
- I thought that if ...
- Just drive damn car!

583
00:54:05,366 --> 00:54:07,695
Yes, partner.
They were my money.

584
00:54:07,696 --> 00:54:10,532
Your money?
Find the Jake.

585
00:54:27,033 --> 00:54:30,117
- Yes?
- I spotted your guy.

586
00:54:30,118 --> 00:54:34,758
A silver Lexus, license plate
magical. He heads south.

587
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:37,007
I understand.

588
00:54:42,608 --> 00:54:45,517
<i> Why I got involved with a girl
my age </ i></i>

589
00:54:46,118 --> 00:54:49,208
<i>Perhaps she was  dreams ...
As I had my time. </ i></i>

590
00:54:50,509 --> 00:54:52,090
<i> Or maybe ...</ i></i>

591
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:56,463
<i> ... was just ...</ i></i>

592
00:54:58,164 --> 00:55:00,069
<i> ... her smile. </ i></i>

593
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:13,607
You have time until
finish the cigarette.

594
00:55:13,808 --> 00:55:16,590
I did not kill her, man.
I swear!

595
00:55:16,591 --> 00:55:19,789
- Why did you do it?
- God, man!

596
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,347
You are wrong! Think!

597
00:55:22,748 --> 00:55:24,772
If he had confidence in me,
of what would come to me?

598
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:30,591
Why did you go to the police? What did you say?
What favor did you do?

599
00:55:31,392 --> 00:55:34,104
He wanted a gun, right?

600
00:55:37,045 --> 00:55:39,629
One of the bullets. One that you keep
right now!

601
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:54,034
Damn ... damn!

602
00:55:55,335 --> 00:55:58,440
Come on, man ... come on!

603
00:56:06,441 --> 00:56:11,380
- What kind of gun was it?
- Silver. Beretta 9 mm.

604
00:56:11,381 --> 00:56:12,381
OK?

605
00:56:12,382 --> 00:56:17,075
- Why Sandy wanted a weapon?
- I do not know!

606
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,998
For you, right?
He did it for you, Jake!

607
00:56:24,809 --> 00:56:26,409
Drop the gun, Jake!

608
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:34,601
- I know.
- Of course I do.

609
00:56:35,502 --> 00:56:38,349
Jake, Lt. Frank O'Malley.

610
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:40,944
Frank, this is Jake.

611
00:56:43,145 --> 00:56:46,743
- You're a cop.
- Not tonight.

612
00:56:47,344 --> 00:56:49,694
Tonight, Jake,
are just a friend.

613
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:56,458
I just want to know who
Sandy killed.

614
00:56:58,259 --> 00:56:59,957
Is not that my job?

615
00:57:00,358 --> 00:57:03,437
- No, your job is to take bribes.
- Easy, Jake.

616
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:06,543
And I want to know
who killed Sandy.

617
00:57:08,944 --> 00:57:10,665
Put the gun down.

618
00:57:12,166 --> 00:57:14,616
We carry this conversation
to my office, OK?

619
00:57:17,717 --> 00:57:19,557
Drop the gun.

620
00:58:03,058 --> 00:58:06,811
- Thank you, Frank.
- With pleasure.

621
00:58:22,812 --> 00:58:25,264
You do not know when to quit, is not it, Jake?

622
00:58:25,765 --> 00:58:28,132
I should be drunk somewhere?

623
00:58:28,933 --> 00:58:31,363
You should have killed
when I had the chance.

624
00:58:32,164 --> 00:58:34,615
You could you kill any chicken
cucoþi a struggle.

625
00:58:36,916 --> 00:58:40,512
What the hell were you thinking?
You bitch stirs the whole town for?

626
00:58:40,513 --> 00:58:42,895
Bitch drinking
Pina Colada?

627
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:47,993
Do you know any thing more useless
than a whore?

628
00:58:52,994 --> 00:58:57,512
- It's a dead whore.
- Are you finished?

629
00:58:58,413 --> 00:59:01,044
No, you bastard!
I do not ...

630
00:59:05,045 --> 00:59:07,214
You took the money, Jake?

631
00:59:35,915 --> 00:59:37,411
You did not yet caught the bastard?

632
00:59:37,412 --> 00:59:40,319
- My place is so busted! I broke ...
- Yes ... Yes ...

633
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,344
Look, Angela ... I can not talk
about it now.

634
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:46,312
You are a coward! I do not close.
I thought her to be careful ...

635
00:59:46,313 --> 00:59:48,872
- As if you were in deep shit.
- Yes, I'm in deep shit.

636
00:59:48,873 --> 00:59:50,055
- No you are!
- You are!

637
00:59:50,056 --> 00:59:51,385
- You are crazy!
- Jesus!

638
00:59:54,986 --> 00:59:57,090
What? What happened?

639
00:59:58,331 --> 01:00:02,076
Call for backup.
There will be a long night.

640
01:00:12,077 --> 01:00:17,598
<i> last time I saw ...
were so sad. </ i></i>

641
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,156
What happens?

642
01:00:24,057 --> 01:00:26,368
- How old are you?
- 19.

643
01:00:26,369 --> 01:00:27,626
You're talking nonsense.

644
01:00:29,227 --> 01:00:33,241
- What does it matter?
- Counts. You have only 16 years.

645
01:00:35,242 --> 01:00:37,347
I have time for that.
Are late.

646
01:00:46,348 --> 01:00:47,376
- Yes?
- Yes.

647
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:48,377
OK.

648
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,455
Can I do this
again?

649
01:00:51,556 --> 01:00:54,539
Call him Simon.
I have to go.

650
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:58,093
No, wait.
Come on, what's with the rush?

651
01:01:06,594 --> 01:01:08,574
Come on, time has expired.
I am a busy girl.

652
01:01:08,975 --> 01:01:12,629
- But it's my birthday.
- Come, I know it's not your birthday.

653
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:14,916
You know?

654
01:01:25,317 --> 01:01:27,425
- Finish ... Finish.
- Come on, wait a minute ... Come on ...

655
01:01:27,426 --> 01:01:28,768
- Stop it!
- Hey!

656
01:01:39,169 --> 01:01:41,628
- Stop the car.
- What?

657
01:01:41,929 --> 01:01:43,840
Stop the car!
I want to get off.

658
01:01:53,741 --> 01:01:56,066
- What happened?
- You can not do that.

659
01:01:56,067 --> 01:01:58,313
What to do? Protect yourself,
as to other guys.

660
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:03,149
Others are villains. But this is a guy Jew
and cute. Just got drunk less.

661
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:08,426
- I like him, is not it?
- What? That's my business.

662
01:02:08,427 --> 01:02:12,311
Not like me. You just told me that.
If you can not do ...

663
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:13,630
You're right, I can do.

664
01:02:13,831 --> 01:02:15,764
Any idea how smart are you?

665
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:19,575
You could do anything, but you still supervise
every night as you waste your life.

666
01:02:21,576 --> 01:02:23,863
That's pretty good life for you ...
Why would not it be better for me?

667
01:02:25,164 --> 01:02:26,628
You think I want to do this?

668
01:02:27,129 --> 01:02:30,280
I have to pay 100 grand ...
Otherwise, I will find and kill me.

669
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:35,682
Believe me when I will pay the debt,
I will leave here in a jiffy.

670
01:02:39,183 --> 01:02:41,971
Stop in to do so.
I will use every bit of soul.

671
01:02:43,372 --> 01:02:45,405
The guy you love
loves me not.

672
01:02:45,806 --> 01:02:47,831
There is nothing left of me
the soul.

673
01:02:53,032 --> 01:02:57,345
One day, when you find it on that boy,
you will find true love.

674
01:03:01,046 --> 01:03:04,713
But I'm not that guy.
You could find someone much better.

675
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,865
Do not tell me what is and what is not love.
I'm not a child.

676
01:03:10,066 --> 01:03:12,431
You have only 16 years!

677
01:03:13,032 --> 01:03:15,536
Let me be clear: you and me
not going to ever be together.

678
01:03:18,937 --> 01:03:21,261
No longer do this.

679
01:03:23,562 --> 01:03:29,091
- You're not my father.
- I care about you.

680
01:03:32,192 --> 01:03:34,668
I want another driver.

681
01:03:35,569 --> 01:03:38,728
- Sandy ...
- I want a different driver.

682
01:03:46,929 --> 01:03:48,730
Even it you want?

683
01:03:50,531 --> 01:03:51,828
Yes ...

684
01:03:55,529 --> 01:03:59,654
You know ... I will say to Simon
tomorrow morning.

685
01:04:11,955 --> 01:04:14,320
<i> what you love
me, Sandy? </ i></i>

686
01:04:15,521 --> 01:04:18,827
<i> Was I the only type of the world
who cares about you? </ i></i>

687
01:04:21,128 --> 01:04:22,840
<i>You were only that 
cares about me. </ i></i>

688
01:04:26,341 --> 01:04:29,776
<i> must gather my head.
Not finished. </ I></i>

689
01:04:40,777 --> 01:04:44,787
- Hey, you still are here?
- Oh, no ... you again?

690
01:04:48,008 --> 01:04:53,224
Business is really hard.
Blame the economy.

691
01:04:54,225 --> 01:04:58,640
- However, why do it?
- As me and I buy a car.

692
01:04:59,141 --> 01:05:01,102
So I can leave here.

693
01:05:02,103 --> 01:05:05,282
- Yes? And where are you going?
- I do not know.

694
01:05:06,183 --> 01:05:07,994
How on.

695
01:05:12,295 --> 01:05:14,698
Have you found that guy
who killed your boyfriend?

696
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:19,322
I'm with you, man.

697
01:05:36,423 --> 01:05:37,892
I loved it.

698
01:05:46,893 --> 01:05:48,616
<i> What happened, Sandy </ i></i>

699
01:05:52,317 --> 01:05:54,420
<i>Who killed  </ i></i>

700
01:05:54,521 --> 01:05:56,001
Can we meet tonight
to me?

701
01:05:57,102 --> 01:06:00,467
- What happened?
- Should give you something.

702
01:06:03,868 --> 01:06:06,347
<i> life that's good enough for you ...
Why would not it be good for me </ i></i>

703
01:06:07,448 --> 01:06:10,328
<i> have to pay 100 grand ...
Otherwise, I will find and kill me. </ I></i>

704
01:06:11,529 --> 01:06:13,115
<i> what Sandy wanted a gun </ i></i>

705
01:06:13,316 --> 01:06:16,680
<i> you, okay?
He did it for you, Jake! </ I></i>

706
01:06:17,381 --> 01:06:19,747
<i> You got the money, Jake </ i></i>

707
01:06:22,348 --> 01:06:23,881
Frank.

708
01:06:30,382 --> 01:06:34,703
- Who is it?
- He e.

709
01:06:46,904 --> 01:06:51,382
She tried to blackmail me,
bitch.

710
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:53,958
Try to give me expose business ...
our business

711
01:06:53,959 --> 01:06:55,531
if not pay.

712
01:06:59,032 --> 01:07:00,709
And what did you do?

713
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:05,272
What do you think? I went to the bank, took out money
and I paid.

714
01:07:05,273 --> 01:07:09,465
But I killed her. I would not kill anyone
for 100 grand.

715
01:07:20,166 --> 01:07:22,942
But you gave 100 grand.

716
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:31,033
- Yes.
- You are so weak.

717
01:07:40,334 --> 01:07:42,380
You have killed Sandy.

718
01:07:43,581 --> 01:07:49,197
Some people do not understand that you can not threaten
a businessman like me.

719
01:08:00,198 --> 01:08:01,658
How did you know?

720
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:06,658
Your boys have told me.

721
01:08:08,059 --> 01:08:09,820
So, where's my money?

722
01:08:11,121 --> 01:08:15,471
Your money?
You forget one important detail ...

723
01:08:16,072 --> 01:08:18,067
There is a cost to each business.

724
01:08:20,468 --> 01:08:23,719
This will not end
not until Jake will kill you.

725
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:28,686
Jake? Why did it kill me?

726
01:08:29,187 --> 01:08:31,125
He believes that you have killed her.

727
01:08:39,126 --> 01:08:41,480
Fucking idiot.

728
01:08:54,081 --> 01:08:55,922
Hey, Take off your clothes.

729
01:11:29,223 --> 01:11:32,330
Get up, man.
Are you okay?

730
01:11:46,031 --> 01:11:48,011
Hey, boss, are you okay?

731
01:13:00,512 --> 01:13:05,263
- What happened?
- I did your job, it happened.

732
01:13:06,164 --> 01:13:07,343
What do you mean?

733
01:13:08,144 --> 01:13:10,864
Your girlfriend, Sandy, try to squeeze
Simon money.

734
01:13:12,065 --> 01:13:14,381
So he killed her.

735
01:13:17,382 --> 01:13:19,737
The case is closed ... as the story.

736
01:13:20,838 --> 01:13:23,312
I think you want to sleep.

737
01:13:25,013 --> 01:13:26,998
Beautiful weapon.

738
01:13:38,099 --> 01:13:40,674
It's a gift from my mother.

739
01:13:40,675 --> 01:13:43,146
Is it bullshit Simon,
but not a killer.

740
01:13:43,147 --> 01:13:45,323
Shut the fuck up.

741
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:50,441
Damn ...

742
01:14:04,042 --> 01:14:05,126
Jake ...

743
01:14:07,727 --> 01:14:09,586
I thought you Sandy.

744
01:14:14,087 --> 01:14:17,605
- Sandy.
- Jake, I did.

745
01:14:18,506 --> 01:14:23,419
- What have you succeeded? What have you done?
- Come as fast as you can.

746
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:44,630
Damn!

747
01:15:08,531 --> 01:15:12,716
Why did you do it?
Why did you give them money?

748
01:15:16,217 --> 01:15:18,186
I'm an idiot ...

749
01:15:28,187 --> 01:15:32,474
Go, Jake.
Get the hell out of here.

750
01:15:35,175 --> 01:15:36,213
Thank you.

751
01:15:39,114 --> 01:15:43,761
Fuck you ...
girl.

752
01:15:54,862 --> 01:15:58,107
