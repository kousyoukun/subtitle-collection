1
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,840
繼續走
Go on!

2
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,040
看你有點孤單  要人陪嗎
Seem a little lonely. Need some company?

3
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,530
我有時間陪  小姐
Make some time for you,little missy

4
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,000
-讓開 讓開  別擋著路！
-Come on, move! Get out of the way!

5
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,720
-快點  -快點
- Hurry.  -Quickly.

6
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
快點
Hurry.

7
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,530
- 讓開!  - 快走!
- Move it!  -Come on, come on!

8
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,080
-別擋著路了  -快點
- Get out of the way, now!  -Come on.

9
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,560
小心放炮！
Fire in the hole!

10
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,200
鎮上又來了一輛四輪馬車
Another wagon coming from town!

11
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,360
是鮑格先生的黃金!
That's Mr. Bogue's gold!

12
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,480
讓開  別擋著路
Move. Get out of the way!

13
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,720
到邊上去
Out of the road!

14
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,210
這些金子很沉
This gold's heavy.

15
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,880
-肯定有很多  -各位都往後退
- Must be a lot in there.  -You folks stay back!

16
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,720
離金子遠點！
Stay away from the gold!

17
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,720
-進去  你  上去   -繼續走
- Get right inside. You, get up there!  -Get going!

18
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,320
馬車上還有更多金子
There's more gold in the wagon.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,120
快點  快把剩下的箱子都搬進來
Hurry up. Get the rest of those cases.

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,840
不該這樣對待這些人
Ain't right how these men are being treated.

21
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,410
他們可是打過南北戰爭的
They fought in the war.

22
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,360
排好隊去領你們的工錢吧
Line your asses up and get paid.

23
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,480
- 好了，出發   - 快走，快
- All right, let's go. -Let's go! Move!

24
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,440
- 好了 排好隊  - 動起來  快點
- All right, boys, line up.  -Move. Come on!

25
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,360
把馬車開回礦洞去
Get that wagon back to the mine.

26
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,330
出發  快走！
Let's move! Move!

27
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,600
我們的水呢？
What about our water?

28
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,760
鮑格會回來的  他會霸佔這片土地的
Bogue's gonna come back,and he's gonna try and take this land.

29
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
- 那我們的家人怎麼辦？  - 怎麼對付鮑格？
- What about our families?  -What about Bogue?

30
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,640
嘿  靜一靜  靜一靜！
Hey, calm down! Calm down!

31
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,240
我們的莊稼快要旱死了!
Our crops are dying!

32
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,920
他卻說我們水裏有毒？
He's telling us that the water's poison?

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,080
- 騙人的  - 的確是騙人的
- It's a lie!  -it is a lie.

34
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,480
否則他為什麼讓黑石人  卻不讓我們靠近？
Otherwise, why does he have Blackstones keeping us away from it?

35
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,080
- 他也是個人 特納  -他有軍隊 武裝  菲利普斯
- He's just a man, Turner.  -He's a man with an army, Phillips!

36
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,000
- 他是個要求開採礦山的人  -他要把我們趕走
- He's a man with a claim to mine a mountain.\n-He's trying to run us out of town.

37
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,880
他的礦工們都在我們鎮子邊宿營
And his miners are camping on the edge of our town!

38
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,320
一個掠奪我們土地的人
A man seizing our land.

39
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,640
一個雇了一群槍手的人
A man with dozens of hired guns on his payroll.

40
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
這我們知道  特納
We know that, Turner.

41
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,200
- 誰會反抗他這樣的人  - 我們會
- Who's gonna stand up to a man like that?  -We will.

42
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,520
- 如何反抗？用什麼反抗？  - 我們只是農民
- But how? With what?  -We're just farmers.

43
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,840
反抗鮑格？
To Bogue?

44
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,960
- 法律會站我們這邊的  - 鮑格就是法律  馬修
- There are laws on our side.  -Bogue is the law, Matthew.

45
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,480
都被他收買了
Bought and paid for.

46
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,400
- 連我們的警長都被他收買了  -還有警員們
- Even got our sheriff on his payroll!  -And his deputies.

47
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,160
我看我們得跟他打  - 我也這麼覺得
- And that's why I say we fight.  -I say we fight. Yeah.

48
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,810
我可不打   我也不會走
I ain't fighting, and I ain't leaving neither.

49
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,680
- 那你做什麼  - 上帝會保佑的
- Well, what are you gonna do?  -God will provide.

50
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,760
說的對  菲利普兄弟  上帝當然會保佑的
That is right, Brother Phillip. The Lord surely will provide.

51
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,280
好了  鮑格是個商人
Now, now. Bogue is a businessman.

52
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,010
只要跟他評道理  他會給你合理的分成的
If you just reason with him,he'll give you a fair share.

53
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,280
- 得了吧   - 合理分成？蓋文
- Yeah. Right. Sure he will.  -Fair share, Gavin?

54
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,010
這裏只有你能掙到錢
You're the only one making money here!

55
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,480
不  你和你的妓女們
No, you and your whores.

56
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,720
本  這麼說不公平
Now, Ben, that ain't fair.

57
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,360
你知道的  你那天晚上也去過
You know that. You were there the other night.

58
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,880
你胡說，蓋文
You know that's a lie now, Gavin!

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,320
- 拜託  兄弟姐妹們  - 你知道自己在胡說
- Please, brothers and sisters...  -You know that's a lie.

60
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,090
- 拜託  兄弟姐妹們  - 講理？
- Please, brothers and sisters.  -Reason?

61
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,600
看看丹尼斯一家跟他講理的下場
Ask the Dennehys\nhow far reasoning got them.

62
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
他把丹尼斯家的所有莊稼都燒了
He burned all the Dennehys' crops!

63
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,360
- 我們的農場在凋零  - 沒錯
- Our farms are rotting.  -That's right.

64
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,680
他早晚都會把我們趕走的
It's only a matter of time before he drives all of us out of here.

65
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,880
為了我們的孩子著想
For the sake of our children,

66
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,800
我想現在是時候離開「玫瑰溪」了
I believe it's time we leave Rose Creek.

67
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,080
- 去哪兒  - 我們能去哪
- To where?  -And where are we gonna go?

68
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,280
我知道你們都很害怕
- I know you're scared.

69
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,200
我們都怕  但是我們走了很遠才來到這裏
We all are, but we came far to get here.

70
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,800
經歷了太多挫折  才把這裏建成家園
Suffered losses too painful to bear to make this our home.

71
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,160
- 讚美上帝  - 阿門！
- Praise God.  -Amen.

72
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
我們做到了
We did it.

73
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,040
我們所有人
All of us.

74
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,760
團結一心
Together.

75
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,080
這山谷是我們的
This valley is ours.

76
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,770
- 我同意馬修  - 我也贊同
- I agree with Matthew.  -I'm with Matthew.

77
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,290
這是上帝的教堂  不能帶槍進來
This is the Lord's house. It's no place for guns.

78
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,280
這裏還有女人和孩子
There are women and children.

79
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,520
鮑格先生
Mr. Bogue.

80
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,920
這就是被你們愛的  你們願意為之而死的
This is what you love, what you'd die for.

81
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,040
也是你們的子孫後代
And what your children

82
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,330
為之勞作  為之受苦
and your children's children will work on, suffer for,

83
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,520
被其吞噬的
be consumed by.

84
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,000
看著我  孩子  上來
Look at me, boy. Come on up here.

85
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,720
來啊 孩子  來
Come on, boy. Come on!

86
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,480
沒事的  兒子
It's okay, son.

87
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,400
我來這裏是為了金子
Now, I come here for gold.

88
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,650
金子
Gold.

89
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,880
在這個國家  民主一直等同於資本主義
This country has long equated democracy with capitalism,

90
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,560
資本主義等同於上帝
capitalism with God.

91
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,290
所以你們不只是妨礙了資本主義的發展
So you're standing\nnot only in the way of progress and capital.

92
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
也是在妨礙上帝的意圖
You're standing in the way of God!

93
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,160
- 就為了什麼？  -別  神父
- And for what?  -No, preacher.

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,080
你能幫幫我嗎？
You want to help me out?

95
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,330
我們來尋找答案
Let's find out.

96
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,240
把手放進去
Put your hand in there for me.

97
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,080
來啊
Go on.

98
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
繼續
Go on.

99
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,480
土地
Land.

100
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,210
這裏已經不再是土地
This is no longer land.

101
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,800
自從我在地圖上標注了這裏
The moment I put a pin in the map,

102
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,200
自從我來到這片荒涼的山谷
the day I descended into this godforsaken valley

103
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,690
自從我看到了它
and cast my gaze upon it,

104
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,880
這裏就不再是土地了  而是……
it ceased to be land and became...

105
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,400
好了  把手拿出來吧
That's it. Pull your hand out.

106
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,920
塵土
Dust.

107
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,960
好了  坐回去
Go on, sit back down.

108
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,240
這就是你們的上帝？
This is your God?

109
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,240
每個地塊20美元  這就是我的出價
$20 for each parcel of dust, that is my offer.

110
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,000
我的土地可是這個的3倍  - 你不能這麼做
- My land is worth three times that!  -You can't do that.

111
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,120
我們要為家人考慮
We have to think of our families.

112
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,280
這個山谷不止這個價
This valley's worth more than that.

113
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,890
你是在霸佔我們的土地  - 還有我們的生計
- You're stealing our land!\n-And our livelihood.

114
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,810
沒有更好的條件
It won't sweeten.

115
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,240
只會更差
It'll only sour.

116
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,840
- 他們進來了  - 大家快出去
- They're coming in!  -Everybody on out!

117
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,200
出去！快！
Get out of here! Go on!

118
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,160
你們幹什麼？這是上帝的教堂
What are you doing? This is God's house.

119
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,760
你們兩個別走
Both of you! Stay here!

120
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,760
你們哪兒也不別去  站住
You're not going anywhere. Stay here!

121
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,560
不  不  不
No,no,no!

122
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,480
- 不  拜託    - 跪下
- No, please, no!  -Get down.

123
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,400
來人幫幫她  快點  快點
Somebody help her. Come on. Come on.

124
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,090
- 出去！  - 這是上帝的教堂！
- Get out!  -it's the Lord's house!

125
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,280
快走  快滾出去
- Move!  -Get the hell out of here!

126
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,600
不  不要
No! Don't!

127
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,480
求你們了
Please!

128
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,200
不要背棄上帝
Do not turn your back on the Lord.

129
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,760
請住手！
Please stop.

130
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,480
- 求你了  快住手
- Please, stop it!

131
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,640
別起來  神父
Stay down, preacher!

132
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,040
- 三個星期之後我會再回來
- I'll return to Rose Creek in three weeks.

133
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,200
等我回來後

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,240
我不給人打工的
I'm not for sale.

268
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,480
先生   先生
Mister. Mister!

269
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,040
非要讓我追你嗎？
You intend to make me chase?

270
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,290
我有個提議
I have a proposition.

271
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,120
我最怕別人的提議  小姐  -是夫人
- And I'm wary of propositions, miss. -Missus.

272
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,250
不知道我的朋友有沒有把詳細情況告訴你
I'm not sure if my friend filled you in on the details.

273
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,400
說了不少了
Enough of 'em.

274
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,880
那你為何不肯聽
Then why won't you at least listen?

275
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,120
我們只是普通的農民
We're simple farmers.

276
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,640
被趕出家園的勤勞正直的人
Decent, hard-working people being driven from our homes.

277
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,600
男人們被殘忍殺害
Men slaughtered in cold blood.

278
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,200
女人和孩子們缺衣少食
Women and children without food or essentials.

279
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,120
都是因為一個叫鮑格的人想開採我們的山谷  奪走我們的一切
All because some man named Bogue wants to mine our valley and take it from us.

280
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,440
巴塞羅繆·鮑格？
Bartholomew Bogue?

281
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,600
你認識他？
You know of him?

282
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,240
聽過這名字
Heard the name.

283
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,960
這是什麼？
What's this?

284
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,010
這是我們的全部家當
Everything we have.

285
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,640
所有值錢的
That's what it's worth to us.

286
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,520
見過出高價的  卻沒見過出全部家當的
Been offered a lot for my work but never everything.

287
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,200
那個人殺了我丈夫
That man murdered my husband.

288
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,880
當街殺了他
Killed him dead in the middle of the street.

289
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,520
所以你想報仇
So you seek revenge.

290
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,360
我要的是伸張正義  我們都應該這樣
I seek righteousness, as should we all.

291
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,720
但是我也會報仇
But I'll take revenge.

292
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,330
雙槍小子
The Two Gun Kid.

293
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,050
這是我現在的名字了
That's my name now.

294
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,360
因為你有兩把槍嗎
'Cause you got two guns?

295
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,400
- 這也未必  - 我說過這綽號很挫
- Maybe not.  -Told you it was a stupid name.

296
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,280
迪奇  閉上你的臭嘴
Dicky, shut your goddamn mouth.

297
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,770
法拉第  繼續走
Faraday, walk!

298
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,200
他只是不喜歡他媽媽給他取名為厄爾
Just mad 'cause Mama gave him the name Earl.

299
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,840
你想怎麼處置他
What do you want to do with him?

300
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,360
帶他去那個礦井怎麼樣？
How 'bout we take him over into that mine there?

301
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,600
在這裏就行了
This is as good a place as any.

302
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,760
到礦井裏去  法拉第
Into the mine, Faraday.

303
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,210
你們要殺就殺
If you're gonna kill me, kill me.

304
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,770
要搶就搶
If you're gonna rob me, rob me.

305
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,720
反正我死活不進那礦井
But I will not go in that mine.

306
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,880
那裏面有老鼠
There's rats in there.

307
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,800
三天前在弗吉尼亞城
Virginia City? Three days past?

308
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,640
你肯定記得你賭牌時出老千  騙走了誰的50美元
Best you remember who'd you cheat out of $50 in a card game!

309
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,160
要贏你倆的錢  我根本用不著出老千
I assure you I did not have to cheat to beat the likes of you two.

310
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
別衝動
Easy.

311
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,730
兩位  給我一點時間  我讓你們見證一下奇跡
Gentlemen, allow me a moment to show you something quite miraculous.

312
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,320
交出騙走我們的錢  法拉第
You just show us our money, Faraday!

313
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,560
52張撲克牌
Fifty-two cards.

314
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,120
- 抽一張吧  - 我們才不和你玩遊戲
- Pick a card. -We ain't playing no game.

315
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,800
我已經在你們槍口下  你們還能看個魔術開開心
You've got the drop on me.You'll get a hoot outta this.

316
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,560
拜託  厄爾  你就抽一張吧
Come on, Earl, just pick one real quick.

317
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,520
你知道我最愛看魔術
You know how I like magic.

318
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,640
好吧  把槍對準他  - 指著呢
- All right, keep the gun on him. -Got it trained right on him.

319
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,410
不許耍花樣
No tricks now.

320
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,960
別讓我看到
Don't let me see it.

321
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,610
給你的夥計看看  記住是哪張牌
Show your associate. Commit the card to memory.

322
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,120
然後把撲克放回去
When you're ready, put the card back in the deck.

323
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,370
別耍花樣
Don't try nothing.

324
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,650
拿槍指著我  很好  厄爾
Keep your gun on me. That's very good, Earl.

325
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,840
我不可能知道你抽的是哪張牌
Now, there's no way I can know what your card is

326
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,250
因為我沒看到它
because I didn't see it.

327
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,040
- 然  - 你快點
- Yet... -Come on. Let's go!

328
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,760
只要洗一下撲克  很神奇的
With a shuffle and a cut, miraculously,

329
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,880
就是這張
your card.

330
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,560
不是這張  你不會變魔術
That ain't his card.Man, you ain't no magic man.

331
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,680
不是嗎？等等
That's not it? Hold on.

332
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,520
別胡鬧了  不然我打爆你的頭
Quit playing around before I blow your goddamn head off.

333
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,120
別忘了我們說好的  厄爾  由我來動手
Remember the plan, Earl. I get to kill him.

334
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,250
我還沒說完呢
You didn't let me finish.

335
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,680
你那張牌是紅桃K  對吧？
Your card was the king of hearts, right?

336
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,360
這就是你的牌吧？
Is this your card?

337
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,200
你看  這點時間值吧
Now, you see? That was worth it, wasn't it?

338
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,640
- 這魔術不錯  - 挺不錯
- That was kind of good. -Pretty good.

339
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,880
這...
That was...

340
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,960
不  你殺了我兄弟
No, you just killed my brother.

341
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,040
- 那我該殺了你嗎？  - 不  求你了
- Should I kill you?  -No. Please.

342
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,360
還想再看個魔術嗎？
Would you like to see another magic trick?

343
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,040
不了
No.

344
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
好的
Yeah.

345
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,730
這魔術就叫神奇...
It's called The Incredible...

346
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,160
不
No.

347
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,650
消失的...
Disappearing...

348
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,200
耳朵
Ear.

349
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,320
我的耳朵！
MY ear!

350
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,080
我們再也不會見到彼此了
We are never gonna cross paths again.

351
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,920
請別殺我
Please don't kill me.

352
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,170
我不要錢了
Keep your money, please.

353
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,240
我本不想殺他的
I didn't want to kill him.

354
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,920
是他不該碰我的槍
He shouldn't have touched my guns.

355
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,400
只能從這個谷底進來
The only way in is the valley floor,

356
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,450
進出的大路是向西的
and the main road in and out is to the west.

357
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,930
金礦在哪
Where's the mine?

358
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,640
在這
Here.

359
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,800
- 鮑格現在在哪？  - 在薩克拉門托
- And where's Bogue?  -Sacramento.

360
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,720
不到三個星期就會回來
Back in less than three weeks.

361
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,240
你們鎮上還有多少成年男子
And how many men you say you got left in town?

362
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,480
大概四十來個吧
Forty, maybe.

363
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,640
是農民  不是士兵
Farmers. Not fighters.

364
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,800
但你知道挑起這件事  就意味著什麼嗎
You understand what it means when you start something like this?

365
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,240
這不是我們挑起的  奇森先生
We did not start this, Mr. Chisolm.

366
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,440
還愣著幹什麼？把它馴服就行了
What are you waiting on? Just get him under control.

367
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,520
在酒吧泡了一晚上  你連一匹蠢馬都馴服不了
Spend all night at the saloon,\nand then you can't even control a silly horse.

368
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,440
拜託  夥計  加把勁
Come on, lad, get in there!

369
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,320
蠢馬？這可是一匹良種馬
Silly horse? That's a stallion.

370
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,320
他叫傑克  曾經還踢死過人  所以他應該小心點
His name's Jack, and he's killed men before,so he oughta be careful.

371
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,640
- 慢點  慢點    -我想把我的馬要回來
- Easy, easy, easy!  -I require my horse back.

372
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
就是這匹
That horse.

373
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,560
兩天前
Two days past.

374
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,000
你押你的馬  我押我的愛爾蘭威士忌
Your horse against my Irish whiskey.

375
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,160
我們在酒吧玩骰子
Behind the saloon rolling dice.

376
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,370
你這是胡說  完全是...
That, sir, is a lie. A complete, absolute...

377
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,880
天哪
Good Lord.

378
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,370
- 我本以為剛才是做夢呢
- Easy.  -I thought that was a dream.

379
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,760
以為你是個小妖呢  原來不是夢？
I thought you were a leprechaun. That was real?

380
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,440
我搞錯了   我是想贖回我的馬
I was mistaken. I would like to buy my horse back.

381
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,280
不過我現在手頭有點緊
Though I am light of funds at the moment.

382
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,720
那麼
So...

383
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,520
看來我們之間陷入了僵局啊
Seems we have ourselves a Mexican standoff,

384
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,080
一個愛爾蘭人和一個基督徒的僵局  不知道會是什麼結局
only between an Irishman and a Baptist,and I'm not sure how that ends.

385
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,480
結局就是你走人
With you walking away

386
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,610
留下你的馬
without your horse.

387
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,200
你為何要碰你的槍？
Now, Why'd you have to go and touch your gun for?

388
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,680
我們只是在客氣的商談著
We were in the middle of a gentlemen's negotiation.

389
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,880
過來
come on!

390
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,440
他的馬多少錢？
How much for his horse?

391
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,360
馬25美元
$25 for the horse.

392
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,240
馬鞍是7.25美元
Seven and two bits for the saddle.

393
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,200
我們又見面了
Our paths cross again.

394
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,410
為何幫我這個忙
To what do I owe the pleasure?

395
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,760
來吧
Come on.

396
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,000
我接了個活兒  正尋找幾個幫手
Took a job. Looking for some men to join me.

397
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,240
有錢賺嗎
Is there money in it?

398
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,600
她是誰
And who's she?

399
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,280
聖女貞德
Joan of Arc.

400
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,600
我叫艾瑪·卡倫
My name's Emma Cullen.

401
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,400
這是我的朋友泰迪Q
And this is my associate, Teddy Q.

402
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,560
我的確喜歡掙點錢
Well, I do have an affinity for shiny things.

403
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,160
- 這活很難嗎？  - 難如登天
- Is it difficult?  -Impossible.

404
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,960
- 你目前有多少人？  -兩個
- How many you got so far?  -Two.

405
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,400
- 他們倆？  -是你和我
- What, them?  -You and me.

406
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,160
派個女人去請槍手  真沒男子漢氣概
Sending a woman to gather guns is not very chivalrous.

407
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,320
是我主動要求的
I volunteered.

408
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,760
其實是我執意要請的
Insisted, actually.

409
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,240
她好像有深仇大恨啊
Lot of fire in that one.

410
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,840
那麼問題來了
Begs the question.

411
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,560
我們要殺誰？
Whose execution do we seek?

412
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,120
巴塞羅繆·鮑格
Bartholomew Bogue.

413
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,440
鮑爾特·鮑格？那個強盜資本家？
Bart Bogue? The robber baron?

414
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,850
那麼肯定有很多金子
Means there's gold in the equation,

415
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,880
但如果死了，要黃金也沒什麼用了
but gold don't do you much good when you're buried with it.

416
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,640
不想幹的話  隨時可以走
You want out, feel free to leave.

417
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,880
只是別騎走我的馬
Just leave my horse.

418
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,080
因為是我花錢買的
'Cause I paid for it.

419
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,240
我只是隨口說說
Just speaking out loud.

420
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,040
從這往東20英里是「火山泉」  可以做我們的補給站
Twenty miles east of here.Volcano Springs. Supply station.

421
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,200
你去找一個法國人後裔  他叫羅比索
You look for a Cajun, name of Robicheaux.

422
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,280
- 古德奈特·羅比索？  - 是的
- Goodnight Robicheaux?  -That's right.

423
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,360
死亡天使
The Angel of Death.

424
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,600
三天後  在章克申城外跟我會合
Meet me outside of Junction City\nin three days.

425
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,880
如果我沒到的話  說明我死了  你可以...
Yeah, I ain't there,then it means I'm dead and you can...

426
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,520
你可以騎走我的馬
You can keep my horse.

427
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,930
你跟我一起  走吧
You're with me. Come on, let's go. Come on.

428
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,360
三天
Three days.

429
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,240
槍  槍
The gun. The gun!

430
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,200
把槍給他
Give it to him.

431
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,210
他已經死了  如果你不清楚的話
He was already dead,if that's what you're wondering.

432
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,160
- 你一直在這裏面睡？  - 他不怎麼打呼嚕
- You been sleeping in here?  -He doesn't snore much.

433
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,520
你是瓦斯凱嗎？  - 關你什麼事
- You Vasquez?  -What's this to you?

434
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
現在  我要撕掉一張通緝令
Here. I'm gonna tear up a warrant.

435
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,440
我只想核實一下有沒有找錯人
I just want to make sure I'm talking to the right man.

436
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,120
不
No.

437
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,400
一點也不像我
Poor likeness.

438
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,560
你是個賞金獵人？
You a bounty hunter?

439
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,290
我是正式宣誓的緝拿警察
Duly sworn warrant officer.

440
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,600
你的槍呢？
Where is your gun?

441
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
不打算開槍的人  是不會帶槍的
Man carries a gun, he tends to use it.

442
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,320
你殺了一個騎警  你的人頭懸賞500美元
Dead ranger by your hand. $500 reward.

443
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,680
那是他找死
Maybe he had it coming.

444
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,960
對我來說都一樣
Doesn't matter to me either way.

445
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,640
- 你想領那筆賞金？  -看情況了
- Why? You intend to get that reward?  -That depends.

446
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,600
我想給你介紹個活
Got a business proposition for you.

447
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,000
這活兒和她有關嗎？
Well, does this business involve her?

448
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,720
是的
Yes, it does.

449
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,600
放我走  放我走
Get me out of here! Let me out of here!

450
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,120
你少這麼皮笑肉不笑的
You wipe that smile off your face.

451
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,240
使勁笑吧  不能讓他加入你的隊伍
Laugh now. Get it outta your system.

452
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,520
我們幹完這個活  之後呢
After our business is concluded, what then?

453
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,520
依然會有很多人來追殺你
There'll still be a lot of men after your hide.

454
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,440
- 那我有什麼好處？  -有的
- And that should give me comfort?  -Should.

455
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,610
我就不再是其中之一了
I won't be one of 'em.

456
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,120
你真有種   朋友
You're loco, my friend.

457
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,290
我來講講規則
Let me tell you the game.

458
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,200
-快點  -出槍最快的獲勝
- Go on, now!  -Fastest gun wins.

459
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,400
勝者得所有賭金
Winner take all.

460
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,120
希望你們都已經下好注了
Hope you've all put your bets down.

461
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,000
阿爾卡德
Arcade.

462
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,290
比利·羅克斯
Billy Rocks.

On my gun.

464
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,400

465
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,080
- 非常好   - 身手不錯吧
- That's good.  -That was pretty good, huh?

466
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,360
- 比利贏了  - 什麼
- Billy wins.  -What?

467
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,560
你瞎了嗎？  拜託  艾德
Are you blind? Come on, Eddy.

468
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,600
- 你胡說  - 拜託  阿爾卡德

- Double down!  -We all want some more!

471
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,360
來場真正的決鬥吧
Why don't we do it for real?

472
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,440
- 得了吧 阿爾卡德  後退  不  不  雙倍賭注
- Come on, Arcade, back off.  -No, no, double down.

473
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,250
來啊  你這吃屎的小矮子
Come on, you scum-sucking runt of a man.

474
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,440
我不想摻和這事
I want no part of this.

475
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,800
- 雙倍賭注 勝者通吃  - 你這是找死  阿爾卡德
- Double or nothing!  -it's your funeral, Arcade.

476

雙倍賭注 勝者通吃
Double or nothing.

477
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,560
他要決鬥了
He called it.

478
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,570
好吧
All right.

479
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,080
他真是瘋了
He's lost his mind.

480
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,650
- 這樣可這麼贏  - 這樣可不好
- He ain't got a chance.  -It ain't right.

481
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,080
比利
Billy?

482
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,160
聽我發令
On my gun.

483
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,960
- 從沒見過這種身手事  -剛才怎麼回事
- Never seen anything like this.  -What the hell was that?

484
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,840
- 拜託  - 好像被他捅死了
- Come on, now.  -I think he killed him.

485
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,280
- 被他捅死了？   -搞什麼
- He killed him, right?  -What the hell?

486
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,360
該死的
Damn!

487
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
該死的  阿爾卡德
Damn it, Arcade.

488
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,930
他自找的  這是什麼鳥事
- Man, he got it.  -What was that?

489
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,080
- 該死的  - 看  我就說過吧
- Damn!  -See? I told you. I told you!

490
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,880
我不會給作弊的人付錢的
I ain't in the habit of paying off cheaters.

491
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,610
我就不給錢了
I'll be keeping my money.

492
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,450
別生氣  古德奈特  他喝醉了
Easy, Goodnight. He's drunk.

493
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,690
他說酒話
He don't mean it.

494
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,960
羅比索先生  早知道是你和你的手下
Mr. Robicheaux,if I'd known it was you, that was your man,

495
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,960
我絕不敢這麼出言不遜
I never would've made such a disrespectful comment.

496
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,560
沒關係  年輕人  只要給我賭金就是了
It's all right, son. You just pay me double.

497
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,130
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

498
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,480
- 這傻子  - 你是古德奈特·羅比索？
- Damn fool.  -Goodnight Robicheaux?

499
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,960
山姆·奇森讓我們來找你
Sam Chisolm sent us.

500
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,530
-把他抬出去  -肯定揍的不輕
-All right,get him outta here.  -Tthat's gotta be real  rough.

501
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,440


502
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,880
來自堪薩斯州的威奇托市
"Duly sworn warrant officer

503
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,480
及其它七個州正式宣誓的緝拿警察
"from Wichita, Kansas,and seven other states."

504
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,200
- 我們說的是同一個人嗎？  - 我想是的
- Do we have the same man?  -Yeah, believe we do.

505
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,400
我們是不是該找個沒人的地方談談？
Should we talk somewhere more private?

506
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,600
不用  我就喜歡在這  比利  你喜歡嗎
Nah, I like it right here. Billy, you like it here?

507
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,520
可以
Yeah.

508
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,600
- 你們是怎麼認識的？  - 我們怎麼認識的  比利
- How'd y'all meet?  -How did we meet, Billy?

509
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,080
他在北太平洋鐵路犯案被通緝  我當時追殺他
I was serving a warrant on him for the Northern Pacific Railroad.

510
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,320
犯了什麼案  用髮夾殺了個人？
Warrant for what? Killing a man with a hairpin?

511
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,440
這個你要花錢
Now,now,you're gonna have to pay for that.

512
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,000
真搞笑
That is funny.

513
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,840
當時是這樣的
Here's what it is.

514
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,720
我在德克薩斯州的一個鄉下酒吧找到了比利
I found Billy down in an old redneck saloon in Texas,

515
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
還有好幾條大漢
and all these good ol' boys,

516
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,480
酒吧不願招待比利這種種族之人
they didn't want to serve Billy's kind, all right?

517
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:10,080
於是這小子赤手空拳  把滿屋子的人都打趴下了
So this petite son of a bitch took on the whole room bare-knuckled.

518
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,200
我都看呆了  我對自己說
I watched in awe, and I said to myself,

519
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,200
古德奈特  對這種人不能抓捕  應該結交
"Goodnight, this is not a man to arrest,this is a man to befriend."

520
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,320
- 你靠他街頭打鬥過活？  -我倆平分
- You make your living off of his alley fights?  -Equal shares.

521
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,840
平時古德會幫我避免被白人欺負
Between fights, Goody helps me\nnavigate the white man's prejudices.

522
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,160
我讓他有活幹  他也能讓我規規矩矩的
I keep him employed, and he keeps me on the level.

523
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,840
奇森先生讓我們來找你
Well, Mr. Chisolm told us to come fetch you,

524
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,080
可他沒提到你的朋友
but he didn't say anything about your friend over there.

525
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,240
不管我去哪  比利都會一起去的
Wherever I go, Billy goes.

526
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,040
好
Yes, sir.

527
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
我倆惺惺相惜
We understand each other.

528
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,640
騎馬去章克申市要一天半  我們還有兩天時間
Well, day-and-a-half ride to Junction City. We got two days.

529
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,480
先喝上半天酒吧
Let's do a half day of drinking.

530
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,760
我就喜歡你
I like you.

531
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,570

很高興見到你  即使暴風雨就要來了
Sight to see, even with a storm on our backs.

533
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,080
下雨也不過是濕濕身而已
Yeah. Rain ain't nothing but wet.

534
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,760
在火中失去的  終將在灰燼中找到
Well, what we lose in the fire we will find in the ashes.

535
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,000
沒錯
That's right.

536
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
好
Yeah.

537
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,360
這是比利·羅克斯  跟我一起的
This is Billy Rocks. He's with me.

538
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,680
山姆  那是比利
Sam, that's Billy.

539
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,410
他和古德奈特一起來的
He come with Goodnight.

540
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,080
這人能行嗎
I don't know about this one.

541
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
她是誰？
Who's this?

542
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,640
她是我們的僱主
We work for her.

543
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,200
很高興認識你  小姐
Well, enchante, mon cher.

544
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,240
- 我叫艾瑪·卡倫  - 你的手很涼  艾瑪
- Emma Cullen.  -Your hands are cold, Emma.

545
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,680
你很緊張嗎？
Are you nervous?

546
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,970
別緊張
Don't be.

547
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,280
我是古德奈特
Goodnight's my name.

548
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,120
那個比利很擅長用刀
That Billy is pretty nifty with them pigstickers.

549
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,400
很好  還找了個墨西哥人
Good, we got a Mexican.

550
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,960
這是多麼快樂的一夥
What a merry band we are.

551
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,200
我是南軍士兵  奇森是北軍士兵
Me a gray, Chisolm a blue,

552
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,520
比利是神秘的東方人
Billy, a mysterious man of the Orient,

553
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,160
還有一個愛爾蘭酒鬼
a drunk Irishman,

554
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,160
一個德州人
a Taxman,

555
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,520
一個女性和她的異性同伴
a female and her gentleman caller.

556
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,960
這可不會有什麼好結局
This is not going to end well.

557
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,560
我是墨西哥人  混蛋
I'm Mexican, cabron.

558
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,160
沒有「德州人」這個詞
No such thing as a "Texican."

559
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,240
我爺爺就這麼說
Try telling that to my granddaddy.

560
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,880
他死在了阿拉莫
He died at the Alamo.

561
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,160
新奧爾良南方軍隊  長長的兵營和刺刀
New Orleans Greys, long barracks, bayonets.

562
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,400
還有鮮血和牙齒
Blood. Teeth.

563
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,320
被一群棕色的魔鬼打死了
Mauled by a horde of teeming brown devils.

564
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,680
我爺爺當年就是棕色魔鬼中的一員
My grandfather was one of those devils,you know.

565
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,360
托盧卡兵營
Toluca Battalion.

566
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,560
嘿  搞不好就是我爺爺打死你爺爺呢
Hey. Maybe my grandfather killed your grandfather, huh?

567
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,450
這想法不錯
What a charming thought.

568
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,970
看來咱倆是世交
I sense we are bonding.

569
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,920
我們說的是同一個傑克·霍恩？
So we're talking about the same Jack Horne.

570
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,200
那個傳奇傑克·霍恩
The Jack Horne. The legend Jack Horne.

571
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,360
傳奇？傳奇個屁
Legend? Legend, my ass.

572
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,320
他雖然殺過300個印第安人
Yeah, he might've killed 300 Crow,

573
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,400
可他沒見過我們兄弟倆
but he ain't never met the Pigeon brothers before.

574
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,560
這來福槍是傑克·霍恩的？
And you saying that's Jack Home's rifle?

575
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,200
是是傑克·霍恩生前的
It was Jack Home's rifle.

576
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,960
有支軍隊想懸賞1000美元要他死亡的證據
And there's an Army fort want to pay $1,000 for proof of death.

577
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,280
這來福槍就是證明了
Rifle'll do.

578
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
你們沒有屍體嗎
You have no body?

579
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,360
萊恩用一塊大石頭砸了他的腦袋
Well, you see, Len here smashed a boulder over his head.

580
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,200
他摔下懸崖了
Fell off a cliff.

581
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,200
偷襲他的？
Snuck up on him, huh?

582
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,640
你這話是什麼意思
Just what the hell are you trying to imply?

583
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,120
我的天
Oh, my Lord.

584
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,560
看來這兄弟倆也成名不久啊
The Pigeon brothers weren't famous very long.

585
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,240
這兩個混蛋
These two ungodly creatures

586
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,280
用石頭砸了我的腦袋
broke a rock on my head.

587
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,610
還搶了我的財物
Robbed me of my possessions.

588
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,440
我追了他們兩天
I trailed 'em for two days.

589
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,880
那是他們找死  霍恩先生
Guess they got what they deserved, Mr. Horne.

590
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,010
我是山姆·奇森
My name is Sam Chisolm.

591
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,280
大概六年前我們在夏安族見過
We met about six years ago up in Cheyenne.

592
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,250
現在我有權利
Now, I got a right,

593
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:02,000
上帝和法律賦予我的權利  來取回他們搶走我的錢
by the Lord and by the law,\nto take back what belongs to me.

594
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,250
你們沒意見吧？
Are we in agreement?

595
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,200
當然
Yeah.

596
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,200
當然  先生
Yes, sir.

597
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,800
你還在獵殺印第安人嗎？
You still collecting scalps?

598
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,120
政府不再懸賞殺印第安人了
The government don't pay a bounty on redskins anymore.

599
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,560
你肯定失業了  對吧
You must be out of work.

600
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,730
這就說來話長了  是水是
Now, that's part of another story, ain't it?

601
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,730
沒錯
Yes, it is.

602
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,240
我們在找人  霍恩先生  找像你這樣好身手的人
We... We're looking for some men, Mr. Horne,\nsome good men like yourself, to do a job.

603
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,000
對付一個人  巴塞羅繆·鮑格和他的手下
Going after a fella,name of Bartholomew Bogue and his men.

604
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,600
我想你可能會有興趣
Just... Well, just thought you'd be interested.

605
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,920
他穿的應該是衣服吧
I believe that bear was wearing people's clothes.

606
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,320
永遠不要相信把人埋在地上的民族
Never trust a people who bury their dead above the ground.

607
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,440
要等過了河才能嘲笑鱷魚
Don't call the alligator "big mouth" till you cross the river.

608
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,680
- 你是當兵的？  - 不是
- Are you in the army?  -No, sir.

609
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,800
看你帶著一把軍用.45口徑的長柯爾特手槍
I figured 'cause you carry this army-issue Open Top .45 Long Colt.

610
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,530
以為你是當兵的
Took you for a soldier.

611
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,450
你會用槍嗎？
You know how to shoot that thing?

612
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,080
- 如果我不得不開槍的話  我估計會吧  - 不得不開槍？
- If I had to, I reckon.  -if you had to?

613
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:40,120
這樣吧  給我喝點威士忌  我就教你幾招用槍的秘訣
Tell you what, for a sip of your whiskey,I'll teach you a few lessons.

614
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,000
第一條
Lesson one.

615
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,000
這個手勢
This

616
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,560
意思是別開槍
means don't shoot.

617
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,320
記住了？
You got it?

618
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,000
你再看
Now watch this one.

619
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,050
現在  第二條
Now, lesson two.

620
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,370
拿走我這張牌
Take this card out of my hand.

621
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,720
能拿走你就能活命
You take the card, you live.

622
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,400
拿不到就沒命
You don't, you die.

623
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,600
拜託  泰迪
Come on, Teddy.

624
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,000
要專注
Focus.

625
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,120
動作要快
You got to be quick.

626
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,680
剛剛第一戰你就輸了
You just lost your first gunfight.

627
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,890
再來一次
Try it again.

628
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,610
第二條  撲克牌決不是關鍵所在
Lesson two. It was never about the cards.

629
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,320
好了  我再教你第三條
Now, I'll give you a third lesson.

630
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,800
你也許比我更需要那些秘訣
Think you need that more than I do.

631
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,680
你還是休息吧  法拉第先生
Why don't you just take the rest, Mr. Faraday?

632
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,090
好的
Well, I think I will.

633
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,160
火還在燒
The fire still burns.

634
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,520
我們曾在半夜聽過這聲音  是不是
We have heard the chimes at midnight. Have we not?

635
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,840
這是個什麼活兒  山姆
So what's the play here, Sam?

636
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,480
有什麼報酬
What's the payout?

637
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,880
金子？
Little gold?

638
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,320
現鈔？
Cash money?

639
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,960
還是鑽石？
Diamonds?

640
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,600
你還是老樣子
You ain't changed.

641
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,360
全部...
Everything that...

642
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,040
他們的全部家當  這就是他們給的報酬
Everything they have,that's what they offered.

643
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,840
全部家當？
Everything? Yes?

644
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,720
他跟你妹妹差不多年齡  如果她還活著的話
She's about the same age your sister'd be by now.

645
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,160
是啊
Yeah, she is.

646
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,520
我只想確定這是為了他們  而不是為了你以前的恩怨
Just making sure we're fighting the battle in front of us, not behind.

647
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,050
聞到了嗎？
Smell that?

648
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,800
什麼味道？
What smell?

649
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,610
- 煙味？  - 是血腥味
- The smoke?  -it's blood.

650
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,730
- 他追蹤我們了   - 真沒想到
- He's been tracking us.  -I'll be damned.

651
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,250
這不是我的幻覺吧
Please tell me I'm hallucinating.

652
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,480
是你的幻覺
You are hallucinating.

653
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,050
我也是
So am I.

654
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,360
只要有一個  就還有別的人
Where there's one, there's more.

655
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,800
別開火  冷靜點
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

656
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,920
科曼奇人？
Comanche?

657
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,080
我們沒有惡意
We come in peace.

658
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,200
瓦斯凱
Vasquez.

659
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,360
你會說科曼奇語？
You speak Comanche?

660
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,010
會一點
Some.

661
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,520
你會不會
You speak...

662
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,080
白人的英語？
...white man's English?

663
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,840
會一點
Some.

664
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,130
你的部落呢
Where's your tribe?

665
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:09,330
部落長老們說我跟他們不是同路人
The elders told me my path is different.

666
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,920
我們的路也與眾不同  我們的路
My path is different, too. My path... Our path.

667
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,160
我們要去對付一個惡人
We go to fight wicked men.

668
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,410
很可能我們都會死
Probably, we all die.

669
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,680
我被稱為紅色收穫
I'm called Red Harvest.

670
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,600
- 他說的什麼？  - 他說跟我們一起
- What'd he say?  -Said he's with us.

671
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,200
給他弄點吃的  我已經吃過了
Gonna fix him some breakfast. I had mine.

672
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,320
那就生火吧
Let's get this fire started.

673
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,160


674
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,960


675
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,160


676
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,490
克裏斯汀
Kristen.

677
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,520
那人不是善類
That man's trouble.

678
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,000
下午好  各位
Afternoon, gentlemen.

679
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,320
鎮上禁止攜帶槍支
Town's got a ban on firearms.

680
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,800
交出槍  離鎮時候再還給你們
Check 'em in. Get 'em back on your way out.

681
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,040
能不能問問  你們怎麼都穿的這麼體面
You don't mind me asking,but how is it all of you go so well-heeled?

682
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,560
他們都是警員
These men are deputies.

683
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,760
這麼個小鎮卻有這麼多警察？
Awful lot of deputies for such a small place, ain't it?

684
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,240
他是什麼人
What's his story?

685
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,890
我的僕人  沒什麼本事
My manservant. He's harmless.

686
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,120
我在上海救了他一命
Saved his life in Shanghai,

687
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,490
他欠了賭債
debt of honor and the like.

688
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,760
你不介意放下槍吧？
Now, you don't mind giving up those guns, do you?

689
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,320
沒問題  為了治安嘛
Absolutely. Law and order, I say.

690
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,920
警長？
Sheriff?

691
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,850
我很願意配合你們交出槍
Now, I must tell you that I'm more than happy to cooperate.

692
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,680
但你們身後的我那些朋友就未必願意了
I can't say the same thing for my compadres behind you.

693
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,360
不少流浪漢啊
Quite a batch of strays.

694
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,960
我會為你祈禱的  簡短的祈禱
I'll say a prayer for you.You know, a little prayer.

695
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,560
可以用你做一塊上好的地毯
Yeah, you'll make a hell of a rug.

696
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,330
而你會被殺
And you'll be murdered

697
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,000
被世上最風流的人
by the world's greatest lover.

698
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,690
好吧
All right.

699
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,840
好吧
All right.

700
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,810
你們來這有何目的  先生
What's your aim here, mister?

701
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,480
這個嘛
Well...

702
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,920
我聽說這裏負責保安的是一群膽小鬼
I hear that there are some cowards running security here,

703
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
所以我們就來這裏弄點金子
so I figured we'd come down here and look after all this gold.

704
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,280
膽小鬼？
Cowards?

705
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,320
黑石的警察們  膽小鬼
Blackstone detective agents. Cowards.

706
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,160
黑石人很棒  對抗北軍
Now, Blackstones are good,union busting,

707
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,960
勤勞的農民們  不過
back-shooting homesteaders and women, but

708
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,520
你帶領他們對抗的  是真正的殺手
you put 'em up against some real men,men that know what they're doing...

709
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,200
不想要我的槍了嗎？
You sure you don't want my gun?

710
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,120
你知道我們是誰的人  是吧
Now, you do know who we work for, right?

711
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,200
知道他的能量有多大吧
The force he can bring to bear?

712
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,880
你告訴鮑格
You tell Bogue

713
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,880
如果他想霸佔鎮子
if he wants his town,

714
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,520
讓他來找我
come see me.

715
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,560
看來他沒聽到你信號
I don't believe he heard you.

716
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,120
去吧  馬兒
Go on, horse.

717
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,960
不
No!

718
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,880
魔鬼  別開槍  我只是店老闆
Devil, don't shoot. I'm the proprietor.

719
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,200
不
No!

720
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,800
上帝  讓我看明白點
Lord, give me clear vision!

721
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,320
看清楚點
Clear sight!

722
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,800
幹掉他
Go on, shoot him.

723
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,800
開槍
Take the shot.

724
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,360
開槍
Take that shot.

725
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,800
快他媽開槍啊
Take the damn shot!

726
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,240
把槍給我
Give me that.

727
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,720
子彈堵住 了
It's jammed.

728
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,090
怎麼樣
How'd we do?

729
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,770
我幹掉了5個
I got five.

730
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,640
- 我殺了6個  - 嘿
- I got six.  -Hey.

731
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,200
- 你幹掉了幾個？  -6個
- What'd you get?  -Six.

732
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,280
我搞定了7個
I got seven.

733
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,640
想比試一下嗎？
You wanna try and tie it up?

734
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,320
混蛋
Huh, chingado ?

735
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,720
你定個時間　蠢貨
Say when, guero.

736
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,400
嘿
Hey-

737
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,240
出來吧
Come on out of there.

738
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,560
來，出來
Come on. Come on!

739
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,800
解下槍帶
Take off that gun belt.

740
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,200
你沒事吧
You all right?

741
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,960
好的很
Nice and easy.

742
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,850
徽章也摘下來
Take off that badge, too.

743
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,240
我仍然是警長  正式當選的
I'm still sheriff. Duly elected.

744
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,240
就當是撤職好了
Consider this a recall.

745
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,970
給你老闆帶個話
Now, you're gonna deliver a message to your boss.

746
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,720
先生  你們這已經給他送話了
Mister, you already sent him a message,

747
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,320
只不過你們不會喜歡他的回答的
only you're not gonna like his answer.

748
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,840
告訴他  他的鎮子和整個山谷都在我們手裏
Tell him we have his town,we have his whole valley.

749
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,360
如果他想要回去的話  就來找我們談
He want it back,he's gonna have to make a deal with us.

750
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,250
他不會跟任何人談交易的  不停你問這裏的人
He don't make deals.You can ask anybody here.

751
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,520
他只會派大量的人馬來碾平你們
He's just gonna send as many men as it takes to squash you flat.

752
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,680
我們等他來  在此之前  你告訴他
We'll be waiting. In the meantime, you tell him this.

753
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,680
林肯市  林肯總統的林肯  跟著我說
Lincoln. Like the president. Say it.

754
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,440
林肯市  林肯總統的林肯
Lincoln, like the president.

755
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,560
沒錯  堪薩其州的林肯市
That's right. Lincoln, Kansas.

756
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,360
告訴他  如果他不敢來的話
And you tell him if he don't show up himself,

757
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:41,330
他也只是個膽小鬼
he ain't nothing but a yellow-bellied sapsucking coward.

758
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,600
你走吧
Go on, git.

759
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,040
走吧
Git.

760
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,320
嘿
Hey-

761
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,050
山姆·奇森  念一遍
Sam Chisolm. Say it.

762
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,120
山姆·奇森
Sam Chisolm.

763
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,720
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

764
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,800
真是個熱鬧的歡迎會
Well, this is quite the welcome party.

765
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,770
- 人都去哪兒了？  - 應該被我們都殺光了吧
- Where is everybody?  -I think we killed 'em all.

766
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,320
不  他們在那
No, they're here.

767
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:19,160
但他們要先確認蠟燭點著了  才敢吹滅火柴
They just want to make sure their candle is lit before they blow out the match.

768
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:30,920
大家都出來  出來吧
Everyone! Come on! Come out!

769
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,080
- 出來  - 大家出來吧
- Come out!\n-Come on out, everybody!

770
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,560
你們都怎麼了
What's the matter with y'all?

771
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,320
沒看到剛才他們做的事嗎？
Don't you see what they just did?

772
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,640
出來吧  出來吧
Come on! Come out!

773
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,920
這些人是來幫我們的
These men are here to help us!

774
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,160
- 出來吧  - 看看這
- Come on!  -Well, look at that.

775
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,640
- 出來吧  - 別害怕
- Come on!  -Nothing to be scared of! Let's go!

776
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,200
- 出來吧    - 他死了嗎？
- Come on!    -Is he dead?

777
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,960
別靠近
Come on. Get away.

778
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,240
沒事的
It's okay.

779
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,160
來  別害怕
Come on, don't be afraid.

780
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:19,370
我找來了這些人  出價很合理
I have assembled these men and offered fair pay.

781
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,080
誰讓你代表我們交易的
Who picked you to deal on our behalf?

782
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,280
但除了我   沒人有這個膽量
Seems I was the only one with balls enough to do so.

783
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,760
於是我就去了
So I did.

784
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,010
正如我所說的  這些人是來幫我們的
As I said, these men are here to help us.

785
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,760
奇森先生？
Mr. Chisolm?

786
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,680
我叫山姆·奇森
My name is Sam Chisolm,

787
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,890
堪薩斯州威奇托市正式宣誓的緝拿警察
and I'm a duly sworn warrant officer in Wichita, Kansas.

788
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,000
我也是印第安人州
Also, a licensed peace officer

789
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,840
阿肯色州和其它七個州的合法治安官
in the Indian Territories, Arkansas and seven other states.

790
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,570
今天發生的事
Now, what happened here was

791
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,760
只是一個開始
just an opening skirmish.

792
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,440
真正的大戰還在後面
The real battle is yet to come.

793
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:07,040
到時必須是在對我們有利的情況下進行
The idea is that when it comes,it'll be on our terms.

794
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,960
- 對我們有利？   - 這怎麼可能
- On our terms?  -Yeah, there's no way in hell.

795
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,720
那個混蛋會帶著200人回來把我們都殺了
Son of a bitch'll come back with 200 men\nand slaughter us all.

796
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,800
如果你們想走  可以走
If you want to leave, leave.

797
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,440
但帶不走你們的土地
Just don't take anything you didn't bring with you.

798
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,400
要想保住你們的鎮子  你們就必須為之戰鬥
You want to keep your town,you're gonna have to fight for it.

799
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,290
我是來幫助你們的  但你們也要幫我們
Now, we're here to help you,but you got to help us.

800
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,250
我們需要所有人都站出來戰鬥
We're gonna need every somebody out here to help us fight.

801
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,760
我的天  你意思是我們就在這等他回來報復？
Good Lord! Are you suggesting we wait here to face retaliation?

802
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:33,960
- 他就是這個意思   -什麼？
- Hell, yeah, he is.  -What?

803
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:37,240
讓他們來吧  我們會做好準備的    -我插一句  先生
- Let 'em come. We'll be ready for 'em.\n-I beg pardon, sir.

804
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,080
我們都想跟他打
The spirit here is willing,

805
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,200
但我們不會打仗啊  -沒錯
-but we are not killers.  -That's right.

806
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,600
沒有人生來就會打仗  但端起槍就不一樣了
Most aren't,till they're looking down the barrel of a gun.

807
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,160
我從未對大活人開過槍
Now, I never shot anything that could shoot back at me.

808
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,880
但是這是我們的家園
But this is our home.

809
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,200
- 我肯定要保衛它  -沒錯
- Damned if I won't defend it.  -That's right.

810
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:54,200
告訴你們  來報復的那些人
And now let me tell you,\nthese men that are coming here,

811
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,640
他們會低估你們
they're gonna underestimate you.

812
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:56,920
這會是他們犯的第一個錯誤
That'll be their first mistake.

813
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,600
你說的雖然好  但是我們沒有足夠時間
That's all well and good,but we don't have enough time.

814
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,770
鮑格說他三個星期後回來  而且那還是八天前說的
Bogue said he'd be back in three weeks,that was eight days ago.

815
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,200
一個星期  - 我們只有...  不  才一個星期？
- One week.  -That only leaves us... No, one week?

816
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,960
一個星期？  一個星期？
- One week?  -One week.

817
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,160
去薩克拉門托報信需要三天
Three days' ride to Sacramento with the bad news,

818
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,480
鮑格做安排需要一天  回這裏需要三天
one day for Bogue to plan, three days back.

819
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,050
你們只有七天時間
Seven days, that's all you got.

820
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,840
我的天哪
For goodness' sake.

821
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,720
我們明早就開始訓練  今晚好好休息吧
We'll get started in the morning. Get a good night's rest.

822
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,040
這幾天有你們累的
May be your last for a while.

823
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,400
我再要些豆子
I'll have some more beans.

824
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,600
感覺就像動物園裏被觀賞的動物
Like being in one of them damn zoos.

825
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,720
虛名只是浮雲
Fame is a sarcophagus.

826
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,650
你這是在書上看的，還是你現編的
You read those in a book,or you just make 'em up as you go?

827
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,360
今後我盡量只用單音節詞
I'll try to use one-syllable words from now on.

828
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,640
什麼...音節是什麼？
What... What's a syllable?

829
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,210
白人吃的東西
White people's food...

830
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,720
是用來餵狗的
...is for dogs.

831
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,960
他說什麼？
What'd he say?

832
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:37,560
他讓你別再盯著他的額頭看了
He asked that you kindly stop staring at his hairline.

833
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,880
好吧
I will.

834
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,530
只要他別看著我的額頭流口水
As long as he stops licking his lips over mine.

835
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,880
這些屍體沒資格葬在教堂墓地
These bodies don't get buried in the church graveyard.

836
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,480
你都拉去公墓吧
You take 'em to Boot Hill.

837
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,130
天黑之前我們應該可以走10英里
I expect we'll make ten miles by sundown.

838
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,600
看來這能殯葬所大賺一筆的
I suppose that undertaker's\ngonna get some business out of this deal.

839
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:08,240
我向你們保證  沒什麼可害怕的
I guarantee you, there ain't no reason to be running off scared.

840
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,920
真不想看到你們就這麼走了
Hate to see y'all go like this, now.

841
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,160
你們不重新考慮一下嗎
Now, now, won't you reconsider?

842
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,800
沒想到我們大老遠來到這裏
Who'd have thought we'd travel this many miles

843
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:32,760
結果卻是玫瑰溪的人都走了  留下我們送死
just to have the good people of Rose Creek turn tail and leave us to die?

844
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:36,680
這裏的土地難道不值得他們拚命嗎？
Well, some people have died for much less.

845
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:47,050
瞧
Behold.

846
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,200
我們的隊伍正走來
Our army approaches.

847
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:58,880
太好了  他們帶來了乾草叉  我們有希望打贏了
Good, they brought their pitchforks.\nWe may stand a chance after all.

848
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,880
上帝  請不要審判我
Lord, keep me from judgment.

849
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,880
把槍放在肩膀上  右肩
Gun on your shoulder. Right shoulder.

850
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,080
刀  其實並不難
Knives. There's nothing to it.

851
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,680
天哪
Oh, boy.

852
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,240
你們誰參加過南北戰爭
Who here fought in the War of Northern Aggression?

853
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:30,960
我沒有
Not me.

854
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,480
這是什麼？  拜託
What is this? Come on.

855
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,000
甩
Throw.

856
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,600
砍
Slash.

857
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,120
捅  就這幾招
Stab. That's it.

858
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,720
就這麼簡單
That simple.

859
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,640
我的天  - 嘿
- Like hell.  -Hey.

860
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,560
- 這玩意誰能學得會？  - 都回來
- How the hell we gonna learn to do that?  -Get back here!

861
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,840
回來
Get back!

862
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,360
開槍
Fire!

863
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,760
上帝都看哭了
Jesus wept!

864
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,000
裝彈
Reload!

865
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,280
就算亂放槍  也總該打中一個吧
Statistically speaking,they should've hit something.

866
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,120
你們開始惹我上火了
Y'all starting to piss me off.

867
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,400
說多少次了  腳下要踩穩
How many times I got to tell you to keep your foot up underneath you?

868
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,290
拜託  老師 把你的帽子摘了
Come on, now.Schoolteacher, take your hat off your head.

869
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,480
天啊
Jesus!

870
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:24,960
泰迪
Teddy...

871
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,960
我本來對你很有期望的
Expect more from you, son.

872
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,210
不是要躲避後坐力  是要吸收它
The recoil is not to be shunned,it's to be absorbed.

873
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,520
我可什麼都不躲避
I ain't shunning a damn thing, sir.

874
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,880
你是要逼我發火嗎？
You trying to make me angry? Is that what it is?

875
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,400
你...
Do you...

876
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,920
這是你第二次走火了
That's the second time for you.

877
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,720
- 去給我做份煎蛋  - 是因為擊錘
- Go make me some eggs.  -The damn hammer...

878
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,240
我不想聽  你回去吧
No, I don't wanna hear it! Have a nice afternoon.

879
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,970
幹什麼  你要把槍指著我？
You gonna point... You gonna point that rifle at me?

880
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,160
不  先生
No, sir.

881
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,720
就算割掉騾子耳朵  也變不成馬
You cut the ears off a mule,don't make him a horse.

882
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,480
- 把槍留下  -我是為了幫你們  聽見了嗎
- Leave your weapon.  -I'm trying to help you. You understand?

883
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:58,080
瞄準要輕  扣扳機要慢
Keep the target soft, pull the trigger slow.

884
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:01,130
- 慢到你沒法更慢  - 像這樣嗎？
- So slow. You can't pull it slow enough.-Like that?

885
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,160
讓槍聲嚇你一跳
Let the shot surprise you.

886
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,120
好了
All right, now.

887
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,690
準備好了就開槍
Fire when ready.

888
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,040
開槍
Fire!

889
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,360
我的手指被夾住了
Think I pinched my finger.

890
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,160
上帝保佑他們吧
Bless their hearts.

891
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,570
這也太難了
That's hard to do.

892
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,530
這麼多人  居然沒打中一個靶子
This many men and miss that many targets?

893
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,600
還是兩輪
Twice?

894
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,890
我面前是一群死人啊
I'm looking at a line of dead men.

895
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:33,320
要對你們開槍的目標充滿恨意
You gotta hate what you're firing at!

896
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,000
仇恨它  拜託
Hate it! Come on!

897
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,760
都上點心吧
Get some gravel in your crawl

898
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,640
該死的
Goddamn sons of bitches!

899
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:40,760
好
All right.

900
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,360
這些人需要啟迪
These men need inspiration.

901
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,120
- 啟迪一下他們  - 得了
- Inspire them.  -Yeah.

902
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,200
畢竟你是古德奈特·羅比索
You are Goodnight Robicheaux, after all.

903
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,690
不是嗎
Aint'cha?

904
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,680
我能打中沙粒  但沒必要浪費子彈
I can hit sand, but we need the lead.

905
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,330
他在安提特姆戰役中幹掉了23個人
Twenty-three confirmed kills at Antietam.

906
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,840
是康納利的南軍中的神槍手之一
This is one of Connolly's Confederate sharpshooters.

907
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,760
綽號「死亡天使」
Dubbed "the Angel of Death."

908
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,400
他給你們示範一下
Do what he does.

909
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,570
他可是個傳奇人物
He's a legend.

910
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,840
是不是
Or is that all you are?

911
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,440
真是好槍法
- That's some fancy shooting there. -He did it. He did it.

912
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,800
難怪別人叫他古德奈特了
- That's why they call him Goodnight.  -You're telling me.

913
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,600
- 真不敢相信  太厲害了
- Can you believe that?  -That's fantastic.

914
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,560
我說的沒錯吧
Told you.

915
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:53,320
你們都回去擦擦槍  也許槍的亮光就能把他們嚇跑
Y'all go home, polish your rifles,maybe the glint'll scare 'em off.

916
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,320
今天不練了嗎
We ain't gonna shoot no more?

917
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,760
這裏就是我們的陷阱
So this is our trap.

918
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,320
應該可以把敵人擋在這裏
It might work. Pin 'em in there.

919
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:18,400
應該可以  但前提是能讓鎮上大半的人
Well, it might, if we can teach more than half of these townsfolk

920
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,250
學會如何打中十步之外的一面牆
to hit the broad side of a barn at ten paces.

921
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:23,160
搞幾處埋伏
Come up with a few surprises.

922
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,040
要多搞幾處
We'll need more than a few.

923
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,920
這就是個死亡之盒
It's a box of death.

924
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,800
那就用熾熱的溫度去融化各種元素
So melt the elements, with fervent heat.

925
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,880
就像聖經裏的索多瑪和蛾摩拉城
Like Sodom and Gomorrah.

926
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,240
你怎麼看
What do you think?

927
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,040
這情形就像我以前認識的一個人
Reminds me of this fella I used to know.

928
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,000
他從五樓的房頂上摔下
Fell off a five-story building.

929
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,480
一路砸穿了每一層樓板
Passed each floor on the way down.

930
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,680
房裏的人聽到他喊「我暫時還行」
People inside heard him say,"So far, so good!"

931
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,200
他現在死了  -是啊
- He's dead now.  -Yeah.

932
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,840
- 我做的對得起你幫我買馬了嗎？山姆
I make good on my horse yet, Sam?

933
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,680
暫時還行  我們去搞些彈藥
So far, so good. Let's go get some ammo.

934
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:05,800
走吧
Come on.

935
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,960
鮑格先生要求在他回來前把礦采開
Mr. Bogue wants this mine stripped before he gets back.

936
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,090
快點  你們這些懶貨
Move it, you lazy dogs!

937
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,040
把金子採出來
Move that gold out!

938
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,880
小心放炮
Fire in the hole!

939
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,490
好像是槍聲
That sounded like a gunshot!

940
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,410
從懸崖上傳來的
It's coming from the cliff.

941
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,930
-是誰啊  -不知道\n-Who was that？ -I don't know.

942
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,160
-先別放炮了  -看那裏
-Keep the powder down.  -Look it,right there.

943
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,280
他們不是鮑格的人
These ain't Bogue's guys.

944
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,560
是啊  他們已經把他們都殺了
Yup. They done killed them all.

945
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,680
現在金礦關閉
This mine is now closed.

946
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,160
你們可以走了
You men are free to go.

947
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,930
當然也可以留下來戰鬥
Or you can stay and fight.

948
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,520
這些炸藥用得上  - 是啊
- This will help.  -Yeah.

949
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,600
我一直想炸點什麼玩玩
I've always wanted to blow something up.

950
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,250
快回屋子裏去
Go back inside.

951
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,360
奇森先生  這是什麼？
Mr. Chisolm, what's this?

952
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,080
是援兵
Reinforcements.

953
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,200
- 馬車上是什麼？  - 炸藥
- What's that on the wagon?  -Dynamite.

954
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,850
炸藥？你們要放在哪
Dynamite? Where you gonna put that stuff?

955
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:56,280
- 放你家    -我家？為什麼是我家？
- Your place.  -My place? Why my place?

956
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,200
天哪  你們一定要小心點
Oh, Lord. Please be careful with it.

957
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:21,240
我的鎮子  我的金子  怎麼會這樣？
My town. My gold. How?

958
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:24,320
他們來的太突然了  鮑格先生  我沒法...
It was happening so fast, Mr. Bogue,I couldn't...

959
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,880
我們人手不夠
There just wasn't enough.

960
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,760
還說我是膽小鬼？
And that I'd be a coward?

961
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:35,360
如果你不去玫瑰溪的話
If you didn't come to Rose Creek. Yes, sir.

962
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,680
- 他說他叫奇森對嗎？   -山姆奇森
- He said his name was Chisolm?  -Sam Chisolm.

963
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,000
- 來自林肯？  -林肯總統的林肯
- From Lincoln?  -Like the president.

964
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,520
他說要多少錢了嗎？
He name his price?

965
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,680
沒說要錢  只開了條件
He didn't have one. Just terms.

966
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,050
人人都能用錢收買  是不是 哈普先生
All men have a price. Isn't that right, Mr. Harp?

967
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,520
這個人不是
Not this man.

968
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,360
他們有多少人？
How many men you say?

969
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,240
- 七個  -七個？七個？
- Seven.  -Seven? Seven?

970
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,680
七個人騎馬來到我鎮上
Seven men ride into my town,

971
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,720
幹掉22個頂尖的僱傭槍手？
dispatch with 22 of the best guns money can buy?

972
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:16,840
是這樣嗎
Is that what you're telling me?

973
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,720
他們一個頂三個  鮑格先生
They fought like three times that, Mr. Bogue.

974
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,600
胡扯  他們只不過打了個出其不意而已
Bullshit. it was nothing but the element of surprise.

975
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,050
嘿
Hey-

976
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,490
出其不意
Surprise.

977
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,440
你以為洛克菲勒需要親自幹嗎
You think Rockefeller had to do things himself?

978
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,560
范德比爾特
Vanderbilt?

979
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:42,210
而我的一切都是我一手幹出來的
Everything I have, I worked for it.

980
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:47,040
不像他們有上流社會的朋友和效力的政客
Not like them, with their fancy friends and their pocketed politicians.

981
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,480
你知道我要那片土地
I want land, you know what I do.

982
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,680
我就要搶到
I take it.

983
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:54,600
你知道歷史書上會怎麼記載玫瑰溪嗎？
You know what history will say about Rose Creek?

984
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,200
沒任何記載
Nothing.

985
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,680
很長時間內都不會有這個地方
It won't have existed for long enough.

986
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,640
但是歷史會記住我
But history will remember me,

987
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,680
記住我的成就
and what I built.

988
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:10,440
德納利先生  召集一批人馬  跟我們一起殺回去
Mr. Denali,recruit an army to go back with us.

989
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,320
漂亮
Pretty.

990
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,280
我是說你打的漂亮
I mean good.

991
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,530
你槍法很好  再來一次
Your shooting is good. Do it again.

992
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,840
盯著準星最下端  下巴靠在...
Sight the lowest part of the V,cheek resting against the...

993
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,400
我父親教過我  謝謝
I had a father, thank you.

994
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,560
我爸可沒教過
I didn't.

995
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:02,370
天  我厲害吧
God dang it, I'm good.

996
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,840
你為何做這件事  法拉第先生
Why are you doing this, Mr. Faraday?

997
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:08,080
我是說  你為何來這裏
I mean, why are you here

998
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:11,000
幫別人打仗
fighting someone else's fight?

999
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,210
我想要回我的馬  這就是我的代價
I needed my horse back,and this was the price.

1000
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:19,680
輕輕扣一下扳機  就能殺死一個人
Six pounds of pressure.That's all that's required to kill a man.

1001
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,800
但會留下一生的噩夢
And they say the nightmares never go away.

1002
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:29,040
你經常會被這樣的噩夢驚醒嗎  法拉第先生
Those nightmares,they keep you up often, Mr. Faraday?

1003
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,520
如果你真要戰鬥的話  最好換上褲子
You might want to wear some pants if you're fixing to fight.

1004
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,120
鮑格會從南邊過來
Bogue will come from the south.

1005
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,360
他喜歡佔據高地
Now, he'll prefer high ground,

1006
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,800
但我們要把他引到鎮上  把鎮子變成靶場
but we'll try to lure him into town,turn it into a shooting gallery.

1007
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:52,090
只要製造足夠的混亂  那我們就能打散他們的陣形
Now, if we can create enough confusion,\nmaybe we can get them to break ranks.

1008
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,760
這兒地形很開闊啊  山姆
That's a lotta open space here, Sam.

1009
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,410
沒辦法把他們擋在鎮外
I don't really see a way to keep 'em out.

1010
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,800
不用擋  我們放他們進來
We're not. We're gonna let 'em in.

1011
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:06,040
對我們把他們趕到這裏  離開這片空地
Yes, yes, we force 'em down through here,\nleave this open here,

1012
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,120
把這變成墓地
make this into a graveyard.

1013
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,320
古德奈特  你的來福槍槍法最好
Goodnight, you're our best shot with a rifle.

1014
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,720
你找個視線清晰的高處
You find high ground that gives you a clear line of sight,

1015
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,530
交戰開始後  你要盯緊了鮑格
you keep Bogue in your sights once the chaos starts.

1016
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,960
我們還有些散彈鎗
Now, we have some shotguns.

1017
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:20,640
可以把槍法差的人安排在每家每戶門前
We can get the men who can't shoot,place 'em in front of each door.

1018
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,440
門口很難打不中
It's hard to miss a doorway.

1019
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:25,490
我們可以挖戰壕  一直挖到到那裏
We could dig trenches.Shoot all the way out that way.

1020
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,760
去這樣的高處  麻煩就在於你下不來
Trouble with taking one of these positions,you can't ever get down.

1021
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,810
無論如何都不能放跑鮑格
Now, whatever happens, Bogue can't leave.

1022
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:33,840
何以見得鮑格一定會來？
How do we even know Bogue's gonna show?

1023
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,880
- 他會來的  -如果他把你一槍打死了呢
- He'll show.-And if he just shoots you in the head?

1024
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,080
那你們也打死他  隨便  給我報仇就是了
Then just shoot him in the head.Hell, I don't know, avenge me.

1025
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:45,000
只要能把他們引進來  關門打狗
If we can lure him into the bottleneck,\nclose the door behind him,

1026
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:47,320
每一批人邊開火邊逼進   我們就有勝算了
each group fire and advance,we stand a chance.

1027
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:51,850
如果出現最壞的情況  我們敗了  那就把金礦炸了
Worst-case scenario,all is lost and we blow the mine.

1028
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,090
這裏是最好的地點
This right here is the best spot.

1029
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,640
可以在上面安排人嗎？牢固嗎？
Can we take position up there? Is it safe?

1030
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,320
那上面有地方站嗎
Anything left up there to stand on?

1031
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:04,080
祈禱上帝寬恕就不用跑那麼遠了
Won't have to go too far to pray for forgiveness.

1032
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,320
說的好
There you go.

1033
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:12,240
但你這樣的人是不會被寬恕的   白人
But there is no forgiveness for men like you, guero.

1034
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,010
別叫我白人
Don't call me guero.

1035
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,650
白人是什麼意思
What's guero mean, anyway?

1036
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:20,320
- 英俊？有風度？  -差不多
- Handsome? Debonair?  -Yeah, something like that.

1037
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,000
不  這是我們的據點
No, this is our stronghold.

1038
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,840
你帶他們都去教堂
You funnel them all towards the church.

1039
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,040
我在哪
Where am I?

1040
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,400
你照顧好婦女兒童們
You keep the women and children safe and out of harm...

1041
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,760
我要參戰
I aim to fight.

1042
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,880
到了需要你參戰的地步  說明我們都戰死了
Well, if it comes to that,then we're all dead, ain't we?

1043
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,680
但願我們死前已經懺悔過了
Let's hope if we die, we've confessed.

1044
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,360
古德奈特
Goody.

1045
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,200
你還好吧
You all right?

1046
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:59,640
要多遠  山姆  大約50或75碼外？
What do you say, Sam,about 50 or 75 yards out?

1047
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,560
就在這裏挖壕溝
That's our trench.

1048
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:06,450
在兩邊一起挖  其他的人都站在旁邊
Ditches on each side! The rest of y'all stand to the side!

1049
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,840
馬車行旁邊也要挖一條壕溝   看這裏
We're gonna need another ditch by the livery.   See that?

1050
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,640
很好  拉
Good, and heave!

1051
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:22,240
- 好  現在綁上  -要把槍
- All right, tie it up, now.  -Put your weapon...

1052
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,040
一定要塗滿了
Make sure you paint the whole thing.

1053
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,120
在炸彈旁邊吸煙？很好
Very smart, smoking, huh?

1054
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,600
- 三分鐘  - 這距離可不短
- Three minutes.  -That's too much land to cover.

1055
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,120
雞蛋是哪兒來的
Where did them eggs come from?

1056
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,800
來自雞屁股啊  你這個笨蛋
A chicken's ass, you dummy.

1057
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,480
我跟你們介紹過我老婆嗎？
Did I introduce you to my wife?

1058
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:41,360
她叫艾塞爾  我非常愛她
Her name is Ethel, and I love her.

1059
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,680
你好  艾塞爾  你真漂亮
Hello, Ethel. Charmed.

1060
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:47,160
我把她看作一生之戀
And I consider her to be the love of my life.

1061
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,920
她可不扯犢子
And she is a no-bullshitter,

1062
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,920
是個直脾氣   -好了 別鬧了
-she's a straight shooter.  -All right, calm down, now.

1063
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,000
把槍收起來  年輕人
Put the gun away, son.

1064
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:56,320
她叫艾塞爾  -把槍收起來
- Her name is Ethel.  -Put it away.

1065
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,360
你要尊重她
And you'll show her some goddamn respect.

1066
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,770
好的
Yeah.

1067
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,120
你可以不尊重瑪利亞
It's Maria you can disrespect.

1068
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:05,720
我和瑪利亞的事別告訴艾塞爾
Don't tell Ethel about Maria.

1069
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,240
等等  你說的是我的瑪利亞？
Wait, wait, wait. My Maria, cabron?

1070
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,160
你也有個瑪利亞？
You have a Maria?

1071
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,160
我有三個瑪利亞！
I have three Marias!

1072
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,520
這不得體
That's not right.

1073
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,720
貓頭鷹跟著我來了
The owl followed me here.

1074
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,960
- 沒什麼跟著你  - 我聽到那聲音了
- Nothing's following you.  -I heard the voice.

1075
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,160
- 古德奈特  -我聽到那聲音了
- Goody...  -I heard the voice.

1076
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:33,890
- 古德奈特  -比利  我聽到了
- Goody.  -Billy, I heard it.

1077
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:38,240
我再用槍殺人的話  我會死的慘不忍睹  比利
I pull that trigger in violence again,I'm gonna die a ghastly death, Billy.

1078
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,890
我聽到了
I heard it.

1079
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,840
- 一回事？  -這不是一回事
- Same thing, it's not the same thing.  -Yeah, it is.

1080
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:47,360
不 女人是女人  槍就是槍  不是一回事
No, a woman's a woman,a gun's a gun, in the Lord's eye.

1081
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,120
那只是噩夢  古德奈特
They're just dreams, Goody.

1082
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,040
要麼談槍  要麼談女人
You talk about guns, you talk about women,

1083
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,920
兩者要分開談  這樣不得體
you talk about 'em separately. it ain't right.

1084
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,440
當然得體  我的朋友
Sure it is. Sure it is, my friend.

1085
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,480
我曾經有過老婆
I had a wife once.

1086
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:03,000
有過家庭  還有幾個孩子
Had a family. Had some children, too.

1087
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,880
有過
One time.

1088
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,360
我估計這針線能比你活的更長
Now the stitching'll outlast you, I imagine.

1089
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,720
你太客氣了
That's... That's very nice of you.

1090
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,800
我沒開口讓你縫的
I didn't ask you to do that.

1091
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:15,680
我也沒讓你開口
I didn't ask you to ask.

1092
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,930
你別盯著看了
You quit staring.

1093
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,360
我沒開口讓她縫的
I didn't ask her to do that.

1094
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,520
人家用針頭在你的衣服上又抽又插的
Well, the lady just did some poking and sticking for you.

1095
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:29,160
你是不是也該用你的小針頭給她又抽又插的？
Maybe you should consider returning the favor, you know?

1096
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,530
好了  好了
Okay, all right.

1097
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:56,040
-晚上好  奇森先生   -神父
- Evening, Mr. Chisolm.  -Preacher.

1098
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,240
- 多麼美好的夜晚  -是的
- What a beautiful night it is. -Yes, it is.

1099
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:05,360
我只想抽時間來這裏
I just wanted to take a moment to come up here

1100
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:10,080
感謝你為我們做的這些事
and to thank you for everything that you've done for us.

1101
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:14,720
我們很久沒享受過這樣的夜晚了
It's been a long while since we've been able to enjoy an evening quite like tonight.

1102
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,770
在你們來之前
Before you and your men arrived,

1103
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:20,600
我們的日常娛樂都被奪走了
all of our everyday pleasures had been taken from us.

1104
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,440
能夠找回這樣的日子  哪怕只有一晚
To have those back, even if only for a moment,

1105
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,000
對你來說可能不算什麼
well, it might not mean that much to you,

1106
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:31,090
但我們都對你特別感激
but, by God,we are all eternally grateful to you.

1107
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:34,160
有些事你不知道  神父
More than you know, preacher.

1108
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:39,920
我最不想玩撲克了
Last thing I wanna be doing is playing cards.

1109
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,650
- 一整夜  - 一整夜
- All night. -All night.

1110
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,760
這些人中  有一些無法活下去
You know, some of these folks ain't gonna make it.

1111
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,800
是啊
Yeah.

1112
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,600
-來  慢點  慢點  -穩住
- Here we go. Easy. Easy.  -Steady.

1113
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,960
把繩子另一頭扔給我
- Throw me the other end!  -Here you go.

1114
01:26:58,800 --> 01:26:59,840
好了
Okay, pues.

1115
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,960
-夠了嗎？  -好了
- That far enough?  -That'll do!

1116
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:07,800
好 再來兩三下就可以了
All right, two or three more of those,then we're good.

1117
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:09,760
好的
That's it, right there.

1118
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:13,400
看  看
Look. Look. Look.

1119
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,680
小心碰頭  泰迪
Watch your head now, Teddy.

1120
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,320
現在你可以為我們祈禱了  神父
Now you can pray for us, Father.

1121
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:27,000
兄弟  我會為你祈禱的  直到我忘了怎樣祈禱
My brother, I will pray for you until I forget how to pray.

1122
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,680
喝水嗎？奇森先生
Water, Mr. Chisolm?

1123
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,610
這是玫瑰溪歷史上重要的一天
This is a grand day in the history books of Rose Creek!

1124
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,120
上帝保佑你  奇森先生
God bless you, Mr. Chisolm, sir.

1125
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,120
這是正當的  兄弟姐妹們
Vindication, brothers and sisters!

1126
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:40,720
- 喝水嗎  霍恩先生  -謝謝你 小姐
- Water, Mr. Horne?  -Thank you, miss.

1127
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,800
為了上帝的榮耀
For God's glory!

1128
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,520
鮑格帶著人馬來了
Bogue comes with his men.

1129
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:06,800
什麼時候到
When?

1130
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,640
明天一早
Dawn.

1131
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:43,520
上帝說  只要有兩三個人奉我的名聚會
The Lord said, "Where there are two or three gathered in My name,

1132
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:44,880
我就會在他們中間
"I will be there."

1133
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,690
你還沒拿到你的那份金子就要走了？
You just gonna run off before you get your cut of the gold?

1134
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:21,080
明天你們都會死的  山姆
Well, y'all gonna be dead this time tomorrow, Sam.

1135
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:24,720
我相信人人都有權利自己死在什麼地方
I believe every man's got the right to choose where he dies, if he can.

1136
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:29,480
這話或許能忽悠他們幾個人
Well, that kind of talk may work with these other sons of bitches,

1137
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:31,210
但我知道你為何來這裏
but I know why you're here.

1138
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,120
你不是為了為民除害
And it's not for the benefit of mankind.

1139
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,280
你拋下了這些人  古德
You run out on these people, Goody,

1140
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:40,120
對你失望的  將不只是他們或者我
and you gonna be disappointing more than just them or me.

1141
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,720
還記得北軍士兵毒打我的時候
Remember what you said to me when them Billy Yanks

1142
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,760
你對我說過的話嗎
were kicking my sorry ass six ways to Sunday?

1143
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,330
-我記得  -是嗎
- I remember.  -Yeah?

1144
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,440
你問我為什麼救你這麼一個南軍士兵
You asked me why I wanted to save a piece of rebel trash like you,

1145
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:55,800
我對你說戰爭結束了
and I told you the war was over.

1146
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,040
-但並未結束  -不 結束了
- But it ain't over, Sam.  -Yes, it is.

1147
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:59,520
沒有  殺戮並未結束
No, it isn't. No, the killing's not over.

1148
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:03,080
還在繼續著  一遍又一遍
It keeps going on and on and on.

1149
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:07,440
- 我見過那麼多死亡  -戰爭已經結束了
- I seen so much death.  -The war is over

1150
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,320
對我倆來說都是
for both of us.

1151
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:12,440
在戰火中失去的
What we lost in the fire,

1152
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,040
還能在灰燼中找到
we'll find in the ashes.

1153
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,120
我需要你
I need you.

1154
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,770
我已經變成了我鄙視的人
I've become everything I despise. I...

1155
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:31,080
成了個懦弱的膽小鬼
I'm faint-hearted and I'm a coward.

1156
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,400
再見
Bye.

1157
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,680
只記住以前的我吧
You remember me as I was.

1158
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:47,720
走吧
Come on.

1159
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,920
願人尊你的名為聖
...hallowed be Thy name.

1160
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,490
願你的國降臨
Thy kingdom come,

1161
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,840
您你的旨意行
Thy will be done,

1162
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,240
在地上如同行在天上
on Earth as it is in heaven.

1163
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,800
我們日用的飲食  今日賜給我們
Give us this day our daily bread

1164
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,960
免我們的債
and forgive us our trespasses...

1165
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,400
你們沒事吧
You all right?

1166
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,480
怎麼
Well...

1167
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:28,080
比利呢
Where's Billy?

1168
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,240
看來他又開始喝酒了
It looks like he's started to drink.

1169
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,200
那好
All right. Well...

1170
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,240
如果還有誰想走  現在正是時候
Anybody else want to leave, now's the time.

1171
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,440
沒人會怪你
No one'll hold no ill will towards you.

1172
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,960
那你呢
What about you?

1173
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,640
我...
I...

1174
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:47,240
我要堅持到最後
I believe I'm gonna see this through.

1175
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:49,200
要讓鎮民們找回以前的生活
These people deserve their lives back.

1176
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:56,520
我沒別的地方可去  所以我留下
I have nowhere else to go, so I'm in.

1177
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:00,490
我們知道  明天會是血腥的一天
You know, I knew that tomorrow was gonna be a dark day.

1178
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:04,000
現在又少了一個人  會更血腥
And now that there's one less of us,gonna be darker.

1179
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:09,320
但能夠服務人民
But to be in the service of others

1180
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:13,520
跟你們這些漢子們一起
with men that I respect,

1181
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,120
並肩戰鬥
like you all...

1182
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,760
我已經心滿意足了
Well, I shouldn't have to ask for more than that.

1183
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:55,280
- 我們明早見  -好
- I'll see you in the morning. -All right.

1184
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,120
我餓了
I'm hungry-

1185
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,120
等等  你會說英語？
Wait. Hell, you speak English?

1186
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:04,280
那又如何
So?

1187
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,800
你這小混蛋  那我們有很多要聊的
You little shit. We got a lot to talk about.

1188
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,040
你別走啊
Don't walk away from me!

1189
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,960
我來頂替他
I'll take his place.

1190
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:48,120
-頂替誰  -晚安
- Who?  -Goodnight.

1191
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:52,120
我看到他騎馬走了
Just saw him ride out.

1192
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:31,640
謝謝你賦予我的力量
Thank you for the strength that you have given me.

1193
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:38,200
到時候了
It's time.

1194
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:39,640
快點  孩子們
Come on, children!

1195
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:41,050
快  孩子們  快
- Come on.  -Children, quickly, please, go on.

1196
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:43,480
快  快點

1352
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:20,160
趴下

1353
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:21,840
他們來了

就這些了
This is all we've got.

1363
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:22,290
這讓我想起我爸以前常說的話
This reminds me of what my daddy used to say.

1364
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:24,680

我爸說過的話多了

但我要換個馬甲了
I might need a new vest.

1370
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:48,720
我們必須幹掉那挺機槍

我知道這名字嗎

你會從你的訃告上看到

1405
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:46,600
上帝讓他們成為綿羊
If God didn't want 'em sheared,

1406
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:48,760
就是讓我剪羊毛的

1416
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:43,200
我求你饒恕
I... I beg your pardon.

1417
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:47,560
是我對不起你
I've done you wrong.

1418
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:48,970
天啊
God.

1419

我要你跟我一起祈禱

他們把繩子套在我脖子上的時候祈禱了嗎

不管他們以前是什麼人

到最後

每個人都是勇敢光榮的

他們為那些無力自衛的人而戰
They fought for the ones who couldn't fight for themselves,

1471
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:06,280
也為他們而犧牲

1472
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:10,400
只是為了贏得並不屬於他們的東西
All to win something that didn't belong to them.

1473
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:13,570
這是
