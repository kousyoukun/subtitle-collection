1
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,840
继续走
Go on!

2
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,040
看你有点孤单  要人陪吗
Seem a little lonely. Need some company?

3
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,530
我有时间陪  小姐
Make some time for you,little missy

4
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,000
-让开 让开  别挡着路！
-Come on, move! Get out of the way!

5
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,720
-快点  -快点
- Hurry.  -Quickly.

6
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
快点

- 让开!  - 快走!

8
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,080
-别挡着路了  -快点
- Get out of the way, now!  -Come on.

9
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,560
小心放炮！
Fire in the hole!

10
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,200
镇上又来了一辆四轮马车
Another wagon coming from town!

11
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,360
是鲍格先生的黄金!
That's Mr. Bogue's gold!

12
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,480
让开  别挡着路
Move. Get out of the way!

13
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,720
到边上去
Out of the road!

14
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,210
这些金子很沉
This gold's heavy.

15
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,880
-肯定有很多  -各位都往后退
- Must be a lot in there.  -You folks stay back!

16
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,720
离金子远点！
Stay away from the gold!

17
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,720
-进去  你  上去   -继续走
- Get right inside. You, get up there!  -Get going!

18
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,320
马车上还有更多金子
There's more gold in the wagon.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,120
快点  快把剩下的箱子都搬进来
Hurry up. Get the rest of those cases.

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,840
不该这样对待这些人
Ain't right how these men are being treated.

21
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,410
他们可是打过南北战争的
They fought in the war.

22
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,360
排好队去领你们的工钱吧
Line your asses up and get paid.

23
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,480
- 好了，出发   - 快走，快
- All right, let's go. -Let's go! Move!

24
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,440
- 好了 排好队  - 动起来  快点
- All right, boys, line up.  -Move. Come on!

25
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,360
把马车开回矿洞去
Get that wagon back to the mine.

26
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,330
出发  快走！
Let's move! Move!

27
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,600
我们的水呢？
What about our water?

28
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,760
鲍格会回来的  他会霸占这片土地的
Bogue's gonna come back,and he's gonna try and take this land.

29
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
- 那我们的家人怎么办？  - 怎么对付鲍格？
- What about our families?  -What about Bogue?

30
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,640
嘿  静一静  静一静！
Hey, calm down! Calm down!

31
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,240
我们的庄稼快要旱死了!
Our crops are dying!

32
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,920
他却说我们水里有毒？
He's telling us that the water's poison?

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,080
- 骗人的  - 的确是骗人的
- It's a lie!  -it is a lie.

34
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,480
否则他为什么让黑石人  却不让我们靠近？
Otherwise, why does he have Blackstones keeping us away from it?

35
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,080
- 他也是个人 特纳  -他有军队 武装  菲利普斯
- He's just a man, Turner.  -He's a man with an army, Phillips!

36
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,000
- 他是个要求开采矿山的人  -他要把我们赶走
- He's a man with a claim to mine a mountain.\n-He's trying to run us out of town.

37
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,880
他的矿工们都在我们镇子边宿营
And his miners are camping on the edge of our town!

38
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,320
一个掠夺我们土地的人
A man seizing our land.

39
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,640
一个雇了一群枪手的人
A man with dozens of hired guns on his payroll.

40
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
这我们知道  特纳
We know that, Turner.

41
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,200
- 谁会反抗他这样的人  - 我们会
- Who's gonna stand up to a man like that?  -We will.

42
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,520
- 如何反抗？用什么反抗？  - 我们只是农民
- But how? With what?  -We're just farmers.

43
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,840
反抗鲍格？
To Bogue?

44
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,960
- 法律会站我们这边的  - 鲍格就是法律  马修
- There are laws on our side.  -Bogue is the law, Matthew.

45
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,480
都被他收买了
Bought and paid for.

46
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,400
- 连我们的警长都被他收买了  -还有警员们
- Even got our sheriff on his payroll!  -And his deputies.

47
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,160
我看我们得跟他打  - 我也这么觉得
- And that's why I say we fight.  -I say we fight. Yeah.

48
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,810
我可不打   我也不会走
I ain't fighting, and I ain't leaving neither.

49
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,680
- 那你做什么  - 上帝会保佑的
- Well, what are you gonna do?  -God will provide.

50
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,760
说的对  菲利普兄弟  上帝当然会保佑的
That is right, Brother Phillip. The Lord surely will provide.

51
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,280
好了  鲍格是个商人
Now, now. Bogue is a businessman.

52
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,010
只要跟他评道理  他会给你合理的分成的
If you just reason with him,he'll give you a fair share.

53
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,280
- 得了吧   - 合理分成？盖文
- Yeah. Right. Sure he will.  -Fair share, Gavin?

54
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,010
这里只有你能挣到钱
You're the only one making money here!

55
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,480
不  你和你的妓女们
No, you and your whores.

56
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,720
本  这么说不公平
Now, Ben, that ain't fair.

57
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,360
你知道的  你那天晚上也去过
You know that. You were there the other night.

58
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,880
你胡说，盖文
You know that's a lie now, Gavin!

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,320
- 拜托  兄弟姐妹们  - 你知道自己在胡说
- Please, brothers and sisters...  -You know that's a lie.

60
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,090
- 拜托  兄弟姐妹们  - 讲理？
- Please, brothers and sisters.  -Reason?

61
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,600
看看丹尼斯一家跟他讲理的下场
Ask the Dennehys\nhow far reasoning got them.

62
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
他把丹尼斯家的所有庄稼都烧了
He burned all the Dennehys' crops!

63
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,360
- 我们的农场在凋零  - 没错
- Our farms are rotting.  -That's right.

64
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,680
他早晚都会把我们赶走的
It's only a matter of time before he drives all of us out of here.

65
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,880
为了我们的孩子着想
For the sake of our children,

66
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,800
我想现在是时候离开“玫瑰溪”了
I believe it's time we leave Rose Creek.

67
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,080
- 去哪儿  - 我们能去哪
- To where?  -And where are we gonna go?

68
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,280
我知道你们都很害怕
- I know you're scared.

69
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,200
我们都怕  但是我们走了很远才来到这里
We all are, but we came far to get here.

70
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,800
经历了太多挫折  才把这里建成家园
Suffered losses too painful to bear to make this our home.

71
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,160
- 赞美上帝  - 阿门！
- Praise God.  -Amen.

72
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
我们做到了
We did it.

73
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,040
我们所有人
All of us.

74
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,760
团结一心
Together.

75
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,080
这山谷是我们的
This valley is ours.

76
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,770
- 我同意马修  - 我也赞同
- I agree with Matthew.  -I'm with Matthew.

77
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,290
这是上帝的教堂  不能带枪进来
This is the Lord's house. It's no place for guns.

78
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,280
这里还有女人和孩子
There are women and children.

79
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,520
鲍格先生
Mr. Bogue.

80
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,920
这就是被你们爱的  你们愿意为之而死的
This is what you love, what you'd die for.

81
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,040
也是你们的子孙后代
And what your children

82
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,330
为之劳作  为之受苦
and your children's children will work on, suffer for,

83
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,520
被其吞噬的
be consumed by.

84
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,000
看着我  孩子  上来
Look at me, boy. Come on up here.

85
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,720
来啊 孩子  来
Come on, boy. Come on!

86
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,480
没事的  儿子
It's okay, son.

87
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,400
我来这里是为了金子
Now, I come here for gold.

88
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,650
金子
Gold.

89
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,880
在这个国家  民主一直等同于资本主义
This country has long equated democracy with capitalism,

90
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,560
资本主义等同于上帝
capitalism with God.

91
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,290
所以你们不只是妨碍了资本主义的发展
So you're standing\nnot only in the way of progress and capital.

92
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
也是在妨碍上帝的意图
You're standing in the way of God!

93
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,160
- 就为了什么？  -别  神父
- And for what?  -No, preacher.

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,080
你能帮帮我吗？
You want to help me out?

95
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,330
我们来寻找答案
Let's find out.

96
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,240
把手放进去
Put your hand in there for me.

97
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,080
来啊
Go on.

98
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
继续
Go on.

99
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,480
土地
Land.

100
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,210
这里已经不再是土地
This is no longer land.

101
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,800
自从我在地图上标注了这里
The moment I put a pin in the map,

102
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,200
自从我来到这片荒凉的山谷
the day I descended into this godforsaken valley

103
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,690
自从我看到了它
and cast my gaze upon it,

104
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,880
这里就不再是土地了  而是……
it ceased to be land and became...

105
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,400
好了  把手拿出来吧
That's it. Pull your hand out.

106
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,920
尘土
Dust.

107
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,960
好了  坐回去
Go on, sit back down.

108
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,240
这就是你们的上帝？
This is your God?

109
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,240
每个地块20美元  这就是我的出价
$20 for each parcel of dust, that is my offer.

110
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,000
我的土地可是这个的3倍  - 你不能这么做
- My land is worth three times that!  -You can't do that.

111
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,120
我们要为家人考虑
We have to think of our families.

112
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,280
这个山谷不止这个价
This valley's worth more than that.

113
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,890
你是在霸占我们的土地  - 还有我们的生计
- You're stealing our land!\n-And our livelihood.

114
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,810
没有更好的条件
It won't sweeten.

115
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,240
只会更差
It'll only sour.

116
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,840
- 他们进来了  - 大家快出去
- They're coming in!  -Everybody on out!

117
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,200
出去！快！
Get out of here! Go on!

118
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,160
你们干什么？这是上帝的教堂
What are you doing? This is God's house.

119
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,760
你们两个别走
Both of you! Stay here!

120
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,760
你们哪儿也不别去  站住
You're not going anywhere. Stay here!

121
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,560
不  不  不
No,no,no!

122
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,480
- 不  拜托    - 跪下
- No, please, no!  -Get down.

123
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,400
来人帮帮她  快点  快点
Somebody help her. Come on. Come on.

124
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,090
- 出去！  - 这是上帝的教堂！
- Get out!  -it's the Lord's house!

125
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,280
快走  快滚出去
- Move!  -Get the hell out of here!

126
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,600
不  不要
No! Don't!

127
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,480
求你们了
Please!

128
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,200
不要背弃上帝
Do not turn your back on the Lord.

129
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,760
请住手！
Please stop.

130
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,480
- 求你了  快住手
- Please, stop it!

131
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,640
别起来  神父
Stay down, preacher!

132
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,040
- 三个星期之后我会再回来
- I'll return to Rose Creek in three weeks.

133
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,200
等我回来后
Those of you who accept my offer,

134
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,850

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,040
非要让我追你吗？
You intend to make me chase?

270
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,290
我有个提议
I have a proposition.

271
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,120
我最怕别人的提议  小姐  -是夫人
- And I'm wary of propositions, miss. -Missus.

272
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,250
不知道我的朋友有没有把详细情况告诉你
I'm not sure if my friend filled you in on the details.

273
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,400
说了不少了
Enough of 'em.

274
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,880
那你为何不肯听
Then why won't you at least listen?

275
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,120
我们只是普通的农民
We're simple farmers.

276
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,640
被赶出家园的勤劳正直的人
Decent, hard-working people being driven from our homes.

277
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,600
男人们被残忍杀害
Men slaughtered in cold blood.

278
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,200
女人和孩子们缺衣少食
Women and children without food or essentials.

279
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,120
都是因为一个叫鲍格的人想开采我们的山谷  夺走我们的一切
All because some man named Bogue wants to mine our valley and take it from us.

280
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,440
巴塞罗缪·鲍格？
Bartholomew Bogue?

281
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,600
你认识他？
You know of him?

282
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,240
听过这名字
Heard the name.

283
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,960
这是什么？
What's this?

284
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,010
这是我们的全部家当
Everything we have.

285
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,640
所有值钱的
That's what it's worth to us.

286
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,520
见过出高价的  却没见过出全部家当的
Been offered a lot for my work but never everything.

287
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,200
那个人杀了我丈夫
That man murdered my husband.

288
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,880
当街杀了他
Killed him dead in the middle of the street.

289
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,520
所以你想报仇
So you seek revenge.

290
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,360
我要的是伸张正义  我们都应该这样
I seek righteousness, as should we all.

291
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,720
但是我也会报仇
But I'll take revenge.

292
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,330
双枪小子
The Two Gun Kid.

293
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,050
这是我现在的名字了
That's my name now.

294
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,360
因为你有两把枪吗
'Cause you got two guns?

295
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,400
- 这也未必  - 我说过这绰号很挫
- Maybe not.  -Told you it was a stupid name.

296
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,280
迪奇  闭上你的臭嘴
Dicky, shut your goddamn mouth.

297
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,770
法拉第  继续走
Faraday, walk!

298
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,200
他只是不喜欢他妈妈给他取名为厄尔
Just mad 'cause Mama gave him the name Earl.

299
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,840
你想怎么处置他
What do you want to do with him?

300
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,360
带他去那个矿井怎么样？
How 'bout we take him over into that mine there?

301
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,600
在这里就行了
This is as good a place as any.

302
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,760
到矿井里去  法拉第
Into the mine, Faraday.

303
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,210
你们要杀就杀
If you're gonna kill me, kill me.

304
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,770
要抢就抢
If you're gonna rob me, rob me.

305
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,720
反正我死活不进那矿井
But I will not go in that mine.

306
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,880
那里面有老鼠
There's rats in there.

307
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,800
三天前在弗吉尼亚城
Virginia City? Three days past?

308
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,640
你肯定记得你赌牌时出老千  骗走了谁的50美元
Best you remember who'd you cheat out of $50 in a card game!

309
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,160
要赢你俩的钱  我根本用不着出老千
I assure you I did not have to cheat to beat the likes of you two.

310
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
别冲动
Easy.

311
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,730
两位  给我一点时间  我让你们见证一下奇迹
Gentlemen, allow me a moment to show you something quite miraculous.

312
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,320
交出骗走我们的钱  法拉第
You just show us our money, Faraday!

313
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,560
52张扑克牌
Fifty-two cards.

314
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,120
- 抽一张吧  - 我们才不和你玩游戏
- Pick a card. -We ain't playing no game.

315
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,800
我已经在你们枪口下  你们还能看个魔术开开心
You've got the drop on me.You'll get a hoot outta this.

316
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,560
拜托  厄尔  你就抽一张吧
Come on, Earl, just pick one real quick.

317
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,520
你知道我最爱看魔术
You know how I like magic.

318
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,640
好吧  把枪对准他  - 指着呢
- All right, keep the gun on him. -Got it trained right on him.

319
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,410
不许耍花样
No tricks now.

320
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,960
别让我看到
Don't let me see it.

321
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,610
给你的伙计看看  记住是哪张牌
Show your associate. Commit the card to memory.

322
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,120
然后把扑克放回去
When you're ready, put the card back in the deck.

323
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,370
别耍花样
Don't try nothing.

324
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,650
拿枪指着我  很好  厄尔
Keep your gun on me. That's very good, Earl.

325
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,840
我不可能知道你抽的是哪张牌
Now, there's no way I can know what your card is

326
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,250
因为我没看到它
because I didn't see it.

327
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,040
- 然  - 你快点
- Yet... -Come on. Let's go!

328
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,760
只要洗一下扑克  很神奇的
With a shuffle and a cut, miraculously,

329
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,880
就是这张
your card.

330
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,560
不是这张  你不会变魔术
That ain't his card.Man, you ain't no magic man.

331
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,680
不是吗？等等
That's not it? Hold on.

332
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,520
别胡闹了  不然我打爆你的头
Quit playing around before I blow your goddamn head off.

333
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,120
别忘了我们说好的  厄尔  由我来动手
Remember the plan, Earl. I get to kill him.

334
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,250
我还没说完呢
You didn't let me finish.

335
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,680
你那张牌是红桃K  对吧？
Your card was the king of hearts, right?

336
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,360
这就是你的牌吧？
Is this your card?

337
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,200
你看  这点时间值吧
Now, you see? That was worth it, wasn't it?

338
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,640
- 这魔术不错  - 挺不错
- That was kind of good. -Pretty good.

339
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,880
这...
That was...

340
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,960
不  你杀了我兄弟
No, you just killed my brother.

341
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,040
- 那我该杀了你吗？  - 不  求你了
- Should I kill you?  -No. Please.

342
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,360
还想再看个魔术吗？
Would you like to see another magic trick?

343
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,040
不了
No.

344
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
好的
Yeah.

345
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,730
这魔术就叫神奇...
It's called The Incredible...

346
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,160
不
No.

347
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,650
消失的...
Disappearing...

348
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,200
耳朵
Ear.

349
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,320
我的耳朵！
MY ear!

350
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,080
我们再也不会见到彼此了
We are never gonna cross paths again.

351
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,920
请别杀我
Please don't kill me.

352
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,170
我不要钱了
Keep your money, please.

353
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,240
我本不想杀他的
I didn't want to kill him.

354
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,920
是他不该碰我的枪
He shouldn't have touched my guns.

355
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,400
只能从这个谷底进来
The only way in is the valley floor,

356
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,450
进出的大路是向西的
and the main road in and out is to the west.

357
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,930
金矿在哪
Where's the mine?

358
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,640
在这
Here.

359
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,800
- 鲍格现在在哪？  - 在萨克拉门托
- And where's Bogue?  -Sacramento.

360
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,720
不到三个星期就会回来
Back in less than three weeks.

361
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,240
你们镇上还有多少成年男子
And how many men you say you got left in town?

362
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,480
大概四十来个吧
Forty, maybe.

363
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,640
是农民  不是士兵
Farmers. Not fighters.

364
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,800
但你知道挑起这件事  就意味着什么吗
You understand what it means when you start something like this?

365
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,240
这不是我们挑起的  奇森先生
We did not start this, Mr. Chisolm.

366
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,440
还愣着干什么？把它驯服就行了
What are you waiting on? Just get him under control.

367
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,520
在酒吧泡了一晚上  你连一匹蠢马都驯服不了
Spend all night at the saloon,\nand then you can't even control a silly horse.

368
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,440
拜托  伙计  加把劲
Come on, lad, get in there!

369
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,320
蠢马？这可是一匹良种马
Silly horse? That's a stallion.

370
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,320
他叫杰克  曾经还踢死过人  所以他应该小心点
His name's Jack, and he's killed men before,so he oughta be careful.

371
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,640
- 慢点  慢点    -我想把我的马要回来
- Easy, easy, easy!  -I require my horse back.

372
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
就是这匹
That horse.

373
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,560
两天前
Two days past.

374
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,000
你押你的马  我押我的爱尔兰威士忌
Your horse against my Irish whiskey.

375
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,160
我们在酒吧玩骰子
Behind the saloon rolling dice.

376
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,370
你这是胡说  完全是...
That, sir, is a lie. A complete, absolute...

377
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,880
天哪
Good Lord.

378
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,370
- 我本以为刚才是做梦呢
- Easy.  -I thought that was a dream.

379
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,760
以为你是个小妖呢  原来不是梦？
I thought you were a leprechaun. That was real?

380
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,440
我搞错了   我是想赎回我的马
I was mistaken. I would like to buy my horse back.

381
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,280
不过我现在手头有点紧
Though I am light of funds at the moment.

382
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,720
那么
So...

383
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,520
看来我们之间陷入了僵局啊
Seems we have ourselves a Mexican standoff,

384
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,080
一个爱尔兰人和一个基督徒的僵局  不知道会是什么结局
only between an Irishman and a Baptist,and I'm not sure how that ends.

385
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,480
结局就是你走人
With you walking away

386
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,610
留下你的马
without your horse.

387
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,200
你为何要碰你的枪？
Now, Why'd you have to go and touch your gun for?

388
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,680
我们只是在客气的商谈着
We were in the middle of a gentlemen's negotiation.

389
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,880
过来
come on!

390
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,440
他的马多少钱？
How much for his horse?

391
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,360
马25美元
$25 for the horse.

392
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,240
马鞍是7.25美元
Seven and two bits for the saddle.

393
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,200
我们又见面了
Our paths cross again.

394
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,410
为何帮我这个忙
To what do I owe the pleasure?

395
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,760
来吧
Come on.

396
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,000
我接了个活儿  正寻找几个帮手
Took a job. Looking for some men to join me.

397
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,240
有钱赚吗
Is there money in it?

398
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,600
她是谁
And who's she?

399
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,280
圣女贞德
Joan of Arc.

400
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,600
我叫艾玛·卡伦
My name's Emma Cullen.

401
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,400
这是我的朋友泰迪Q
And this is my associate, Teddy Q.

402
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,560
我的确喜欢挣点钱
Well, I do have an affinity for shiny things.

403
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,160
- 这活很难吗？  - 难如登天
- Is it difficult?  -Impossible.

404
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,960
- 你目前有多少人？  -两个
- How many you got so far?  -Two.

405
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,400
- 他们俩？  -是你和我
- What, them?  -You and me.

406
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,160
派个女人去请枪手  真没男子汉气概
Sending a woman to gather guns is not very chivalrous.

407
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,320
是我主动要求的
I volunteered.

408
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,760
其实是我执意要请的
Insisted, actually.

409
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,240
她好像有深仇大恨啊
Lot of fire in that one.

410
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,840
那么问题来了
Begs the question.

411
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,560
我们要杀谁？
Whose execution do we seek?

412
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,120
巴塞罗缪·鲍格
Bartholomew Bogue.

413
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,440
鲍尔特·鲍格？那个强盗资本家？
Bart Bogue? The robber baron?

414
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,850
那么肯定有很多金子
Means there's gold in the equation,

415
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,880
但如果死了，要黄金也没什么用了
but gold don't do you much good when you're buried with it.

416
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,640
不想干的话  随时可以走
You want out, feel free to leave.

417
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,880
只是别骑走我的马
Just leave my horse.

418
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,080
因为是我花钱买的
'Cause I paid for it.

419
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,240
我只是随口说说
Just speaking out loud.

420
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,040
从这往东20英里是“火山泉”  可以做我们的补给站
Twenty miles east of here.Volcano Springs. Supply station.

421
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,200
你去找一个法国人后裔  他叫罗比索
You look for a Cajun, name of Robicheaux.

422
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,280
- 古德奈特·罗比索？  - 是的
- Goodnight Robicheaux?  -That's right.

423
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,360
死亡天使
The Angel of Death.

424
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,600
三天后  在章克申城外跟我会合
Meet me outside of Junction City\nin three days.

425
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,880
如果我没到的话  说明我死了  你可以...
Yeah, I ain't there,then it means I'm dead and you can...

426
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,520
你可以骑走我的马
You can keep my horse.

427
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,930
你跟我一起  走吧
You're with me. Come on, let's go. Come on.

428
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,360
三天
Three days.

429
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,240
枪  枪
The gun. The gun!

430
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,200
把枪给他
Give it to him.

431
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,210
他已经死了  如果你不清楚的话
He was already dead,if that's what you're wondering.

432
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,160
- 你一直在这里面睡？  - 他不怎么打呼噜
- You been sleeping in here?  -He doesn't snore much.

433
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,520
你是瓦斯凯吗？  - 关你什么事
- You Vasquez?  -What's this to you?

434
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
现在  我要撕掉一张通缉令
Here. I'm gonna tear up a warrant.

435
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,440
我只想核实一下有没有找错人
I just want to make sure I'm talking to the right man.

436
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,120
不
No.

437
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,400
一点也不像我
Poor likeness.

438
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,560
你是个赏金猎人？
You a bounty hunter?

439
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,290
我是正式宣誓的缉拿警察
Duly sworn warrant officer.

440
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,600
你的枪呢？
Where is your gun?

441
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
不打算开枪的人  是不会带枪的
Man carries a gun, he tends to use it.

442
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,320
你杀了一个骑警  你的人头悬赏500美元
Dead ranger by your hand. $500 reward.

443
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,680
那是他找死
Maybe he had it coming.

444
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,960
对我来说都一样
Doesn't matter to me either way.

445
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,640
- 你想领那笔赏金？  -看情况了
- Why? You intend to get that reward?  -That depends.

446
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,600
我想给你介绍个活
Got a business proposition for you.

447
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,000
这活儿和她有关吗？
Well, does this business involve her?

448
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,720
是的
Yes, it does.

449
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,600
放我走  放我走
Get me out of here! Let me out of here!

450
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,120
你少这么皮笑肉不笑的
You wipe that smile off your face.

451
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,240
使劲笑吧  不能让他加入你的队伍
Laugh now. Get it outta your system.

452
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,520
我们干完这个活  之后呢
After our business is concluded, what then?

453
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,520
依然会有很多人来追杀你
There'll still be a lot of men after your hide.

454
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,440
- 那我有什么好处？  -有的
- And that should give me comfort?  -Should.

455
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,610
我就不再是其中之一了
I won't be one of 'em.

456
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,120
你真有种   朋友
You're loco, my friend.

457
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,290
我来讲讲规则
Let me tell you the game.

458
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,200
-快点  -出枪最快的获胜
- Go on, now!  -Fastest gun wins.

459
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,400
胜者得所有赌金
Winner take all.

460
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,120
希望你们都已经下好注了
Hope you've all put your bets down.

461
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,000
阿尔卡德
Arcade.

462
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,290
比利·罗克斯
Billy Rocks.

463
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,360
听我的发令枪
On my gun.

464
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,400
怎么样  伙计们
Yeah, how about that, boys?

465
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,080
- 非常好   - 身手不错吧
- That's good.  -That was pretty good, huh?

466
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,360
- 比利赢了  - 什么
- Billy wins.  -What?

467
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,560
你瞎了吗？  拜托  艾德
Are you blind? Come on, Eddy.

468
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,600
- 你胡说  - 拜托  阿尔卡德
- You're a liar!\n-Come on, Arcade.

469
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,960
- 嘿 拜托  大家都看到是我赢了  -是啊
- Hey, come on, we all saw me win, now.  -Yeah!

470
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,160
- 双倍下注  - 再来一局
- Double down!  -We all want some more!

471
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,360
来场真正的决斗吧
Why don't we do it for real?

472
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,440
- 得了吧 阿尔卡德  后退  不  不  双倍赌注
- Come on, Arcade, back off.  -No, no, double down.

473
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,250
来啊  你这吃屎的小矮子
Come on, you scum-sucking runt of a man.

474
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,440
我不想掺和这事
I want no part of this.

475
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,800
- 双倍赌注 胜者通吃  - 你这是找死  阿尔卡德
- Double or nothing!  -it's your funeral, Arcade.

476
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,880
双倍赌注 胜者通吃
Double or nothing.

477
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,560
他要决斗了
He called it.

478
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,570
好吧
All right.

479
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,080
他真是疯了
He's lost his mind.

480
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,650
- 这样可这么赢  - 这样可不好
- He ain't got a chance.  -It ain't right.

481
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,080
比利
Billy?

482
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,160
听我发令
On my gun.

483
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,960
- 从没见过这种身手事  -刚才怎么回事
- Never seen anything like this.  -What the hell was that?

484
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,840
- 拜托  - 好像被他捅死了
- Come on, now.  -I think he killed him.

485
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,280
- 被他捅死了？   -搞什么
- He killed him, right?  -What the hell?

486
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,360
该死的
Damn!

487
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
该死的  阿尔卡德
Damn it, Arcade.

488
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,930
他自找的  这是什么鸟事
- Man, he got it.  -What was that?

489
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,080
- 该死的  - 看  我就说过吧
- Damn!  -See? I told you. I told you!

490
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,880
我不会给作弊的人付钱的
I ain't in the habit of paying off cheaters.

491
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,610
我就不给钱了
I'll be keeping my money.

492
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,450
别生气  古德奈特  他喝醉了
Easy, Goodnight. He's drunk.

493
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,690
他说酒话
He don't mean it.

494
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,960
罗比索先生  早知道是你和你的手下
Mr. Robicheaux,if I'd known it was you, that was your man,

495
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,960
我绝不敢这么出言不逊
I never would've made such a disrespectful comment.

496
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,560
没关系  年轻人  只要给我赌金就是了
It's all right, son. You just pay me double.

497
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,130
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

498
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,480
- 这傻子  - 你是古德奈特·罗比索？
- Damn fool.  -Goodnight Robicheaux?

499
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,960
山姆·奇森让我们来找你
Sam Chisolm sent us.

500
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,530
-把他抬出去  -肯定揍的不轻
-All right,get him outta here.  -Tthat's gotta be real  rough.

501
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,440


502
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,880
来自堪萨斯州的威奇托市
"Duly sworn warrant officer

503
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,480
及其它七个州正式宣誓的缉拿警察
"from Wichita, Kansas,and seven other states."

504
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,200
- 我们说的是同一个人吗？  - 我想是的
- Do we have the same man?  -Yeah, believe we do.

505
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,400
我们是不是该找个没人的地方谈谈？
Should we talk somewhere more private?

506
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,600
不用  我就喜欢在这  比利  你喜欢吗
Nah, I like it right here. Billy, you like it here?

507
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,520
可以
Yeah.

508
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,600
- 你们是怎么认识的？  - 我们怎么认识的  比利
- How'd y'all meet?  -How did we meet, Billy?

509
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,080
他在北太平洋铁路犯案被通缉  我当时追杀他
I was serving a warrant on him for the Northern Pacific Railroad.

510
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,320
犯了什么案  用发夹杀了个人？
Warrant for what? Killing a man with a hairpin?

511
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,440
这个你要花钱
Now,now,you're gonna have to pay for that.

512
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,000
真搞笑
That is funny.

513
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,840
当时是这样的
Here's what it is.

514
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,720
我在德克萨斯州的一个乡下酒吧找到了比利
I found Billy down in an old redneck saloon in Texas,

515
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
还有好几条大汉
and all these good ol' boys,

516
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,480
酒吧不愿招待比利这种种族之人
they didn't want to serve Billy's kind, all right?

517
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:10,080
于是这小子赤手空拳  把满屋子的人都打趴下了
So this petite son of a bitch took on the whole room bare-knuckled.

518
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,200
我都看呆了  我对自己说
I watched in awe, and I said to myself,

519
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,200
古德奈特  对这种人不能抓捕  应该结交
"Goodnight, this is not a man to arrest,this is a man to befriend."

520
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,320
- 你靠他街头打斗过活？  -我俩平分
- You make your living off of his alley fights?  -Equal shares.

521
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,840
平时古德会帮我避免被白人欺负
Between fights, Goody helps me\nnavigate the white man's prejudices.

522
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,160
我让他有活干  他也能让我规规矩矩的
I keep him employed, and he keeps me on the level.

523
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,840
奇森先生让我们来找你
Well, Mr. Chisolm told us to come fetch you,

524
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,080
可他没提到你的朋友
but he didn't say anything about your friend over there.

525
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,240
不管我去哪  比利都会一起去的
Wherever I go, Billy goes.

526
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,040
好
Yes, sir.

527
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
我俩惺惺相惜
We understand each other.

528
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,640
骑马去章克申市要一天半  我们还有两天时间
Well, day-and-a-half ride to Junction City. We got two days.

529
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,480
先喝上半天酒吧
Let's do a half day of drinking.

530
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,760
我就喜欢你
I like you.

531
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,570
- 山姆·奇森  -古德奈特·罗比索
- Sam Chisolm!  -Goodnight Robicheaux.

532
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,520
很高兴见到你  即使暴风雨就要来了
Sight to see, even with a storm on our backs.

533
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,080
下雨也不过是湿湿身而已
Yeah. Rain ain't nothing but wet.

534
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,760
在火中失去的  终将在灰烬中找到
Well, what we lose in the fire we will find in the ashes.

535
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,000
没错
That's right.

536
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
好
Yeah.

537
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,360
这是比利·罗克斯  跟我一起的
This is Billy Rocks. He's with me.

538
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,680
山姆  那是比利
Sam, that's Billy.

539
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,410
他和古德奈特一起来的
He come with Goodnight.

540
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,080
这人能行吗
I don't know about this one.

541
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
她是谁？
Who's this?

542
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,640
她是我们的雇主
We work for her.

543
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,200
很高兴认识你  小姐
Well, enchanté, mon cher.

544

- 我叫艾玛·卡伦  - 你的手很凉  艾玛
- Emma Cullen.  -Your hands are cold, Emma.

545
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,680
你很紧张吗？
Are you nervous?

546
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,970
别紧张
Don't be.

547
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,280
我是古德奈特
Goodnight's my name.

548
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,120
那个比利很擅长用刀
That Billy is pretty nifty with them pigstickers.

549
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,400
很好  还找了个墨西哥人
Good, we got a Mexican.

550
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,960
这是多么快乐的一伙
What a merry band we are.

551
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,200
我是南军士兵  奇森是北军士兵
Me a gray, Chisolm a blue,

552
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,520
比利是神秘的东方人
Billy, a mysterious man of the Orient,

553
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,160
还有一个爱尔兰酒鬼

554
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,160
一个德州人
a Taxman,

555
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,520
一个女性和她的异性同伴
a female and her gentleman caller.

556
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,960
这可不会有什么好结局
This is not going to end well.

557
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,560
我是墨西哥人  混蛋
I'm Mexican, cabron.

558
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,160
没有“德州人”这个词
No such thing as a "Texican."

559
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,240
我爷爷就这么说
Try telling that to my granddaddy.

560
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,880
他死在了阿拉莫
He died at the Alamo.

561
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,160
新奥尔良南方军队  长长的兵营和刺刀

还有鲜血和牙齿
Blood. Teeth.

563
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,320
被一群棕色的魔鬼打死了
Mauled by a horde of teeming brown devils.

564
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,680
我爷爷当年就是棕色魔鬼中的一员
My grandfather was one of those devils,you know.

565
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,360
托卢卡兵营
Toluca Battalion.

566
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,560
嘿  搞不好就是我爷爷打死你爷爷呢
Hey. Maybe my grandfather killed your grandfather, huh?

567
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,450
这想法不错
What a charming thought.

568
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,970
看来咱俩是世交
I sense we are bonding.

569
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,920
我们说的是同一个杰克·霍恩？
So we're talking about the same Jack Horne.

570
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,200
那个传奇杰克·霍恩
The Jack Horne. The legend Jack Horne.

571
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,360
传奇？传奇个屁
Legend? Legend, my ass.

572
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,320
他虽然杀过300个印第安人
Yeah, he might've killed 300 Crow,

573
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,400
可他没见过我们兄弟俩
but he ain't never met the Pigeon brothers before.

574
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,560
这来福枪是杰克·霍恩的？
And you saying that's Jack Home's rifle?

575
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,200
是是杰克·霍恩生前的
It was Jack Home's rifle.

576
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,960
有支军队想悬赏1000美元要他死亡的证据
And there's an Army fort want to pay $1,000 for proof of death.

577
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,280
这来福枪就是证明了
Rifle'll do.

578
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
你们没有尸体吗
You have no body?

579
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,360
莱恩用一块大石头砸了他的脑袋
Well, you see, Len here smashed a boulder over his head.

580
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,200
他摔下悬崖了
Fell off a cliff.

581
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,200
偷袭他的？
Snuck up on him, huh?

582
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,640
你这话是什么意思
Just what the hell are you trying to imply?

583
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,120
我的天
Oh, my Lord.

584
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,560
看来这兄弟俩也成名不久啊
The Pigeon brothers weren't famous very long.

585
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,240
这两个混蛋
These two ungodly creatures

586
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,280
用石头砸了我的脑袋
broke a rock on my head.

587
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,610
还抢了我的财物
Robbed me of my possessions.

588
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,440
我追了他们两天
I trailed 'em for two days.

589
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,880
那是他们找死  霍恩先生
Guess they got what they deserved, Mr. Horne.

590
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,010
我是山姆·奇森
My name is Sam Chisolm.

591
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,280
大概六年前我们在夏安族见过
We met about six years ago up in Cheyenne.

592
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,250
现在我有权利
Now, I got a right,

593
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:02,000
上帝和法律赋予我的权利  来取回他们抢走我的钱
by the Lord and by the law,\nto take back what belongs to me.

594
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,250
你们没意见吧？
Are we in agreement?

595
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,200
当然
Yeah.

596
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,200
当然  先生
Yes, sir.

597
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,800
你还在猎杀印第安人吗？
You still collecting scalps?

598
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,120
政府不再悬赏杀印第安人了
The government don't pay a bounty on redskins anymore.

599
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,560
你肯定失业了  对吧
You must be out of work.

600
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,730
这就说来话长了  是水是
Now, that's part of another story, ain't it?

601
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,730
没错
Yes, it is.

602
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,240
我们在找人  霍恩先生  找像你这样好身手的人
We... We're looking for some men, Mr. Horne,\nsome good men like yourself, to do a job.

603
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,000
对付一个人  巴塞罗缪·鲍格和他的手下
Going after a fella,name of Bartholomew Bogue and his men.

604
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,600
我想你可能会有兴趣
Just... Well, just thought you'd be interested.

605
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,920
他穿的应该是衣服吧
I believe that bear was wearing people's clothes.

606
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,320
永远不要相信把人埋在地上的民族
Never trust a people who bury their dead above the ground.

607
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,440
要等过了河才能嘲笑鳄鱼
Don't call the alligator "big mouth" till you cross the river.

608
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,680
- 你是当兵的？  - 不是
- Are you in the army?  -No, sir.

609
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,800
看你带着一把军用.45口径的长柯尔特手枪
I figured 'cause you carry this army-issue Open Top .45 Long Colt.

610
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,530
以为你是当兵的
Took you for a soldier.

611
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,450
你会用枪吗？
You know how to shoot that thing?

612
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,080
- 如果我不得不开枪的话  我估计会吧  - 不得不开枪？
- If I had to, I reckon.  -if you had to?

613
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:40,120
这样吧  给我喝点威士忌  我就教你几招用枪的秘诀
Tell you what, for a sip of your whiskey,I'll teach you a few lessons.

614
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,000
第一条
Lesson one.

615
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,000
这个手势
This

616
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,560
意思是别开枪
means don't shoot.

617
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,320
记住了？
You got it?

618
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,000
你再看
Now watch this one.

619
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,050
现在  第二条
Now, lesson two.

620
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,370
拿走我这张牌
Take this card out of my hand.

621
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,720
能拿走你就能活命
You take the card, you live.

622
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,400
拿不到就没命
You don't, you die.

623
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,600
拜托  泰迪
Come on, Teddy.

624
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,000
要专注
Focus.

625
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,120
动作要快
You got to be quick.

626
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,680
刚刚第一战你就输了
You just lost your first gunfight.

627
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,890
再来一次
Try it again.

628
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,610
第二条  扑克牌决不是关键所在
Lesson two. It was never about the cards.

629
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,320
好了  我再教你第三条
Now, I'll give you a third lesson.

630
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,800
你也许比我更需要那些秘诀
Think you need that more than I do.

631
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,680
你还是休息吧  法拉第先生
Why don't you just take the rest, Mr. Faraday?

632
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,090
好的
Well, I think I will.

633
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,160
火还在烧
The fire still burns.

634
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,520
我们曾在半夜听过这声音  是不是
We have heard the chimes at midnight. Have we not?

635
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,840
这是个什么活儿  山姆
So what's the play here, Sam?

636
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,480
有什么报酬
What's the payout?

637
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,880
金子？
Little gold?

638
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,320
现钞？
Cash money?

639
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,960
还是钻石？
Diamonds?

640
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,600
你还是老样子
You ain't changed.

641
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,360
全部...
Everything that...

642
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,040
他们的全部家当  这就是他们给的报酬
Everything they have,that's what they offered.

643
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,840
全部家当？
Everything? Yes?

644
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,720
他跟你妹妹差不多年龄  如果她还活着的话
She's about the same age your sister'd be by now.

645
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,160
是啊
Yeah, she is.

646
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,520
我只想确定这是为了他们  而不是为了你以前的恩怨
Just making sure we're fighting the battle in front of us, not behind.

647
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,050
闻到了吗？
Smell that?

648
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,800
什么味道？
What smell?

649
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,610
- 烟味？  - 是血腥味
- The smoke?  -it's blood.

650
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,730
- 他追踪我们了   - 真没想到
- He's been tracking us.  -I'll be damned.

651
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,250
这不是我的幻觉吧
Please tell me I'm hallucinating.

652
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,480
是你的幻觉
You are hallucinating.

653
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,050
我也是
So am I.

654
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,360
只要有一个  就还有别的人
Where there's one, there's more.

655
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,800
别开火  冷静点
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

656
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,920
科曼奇人？
Comanche?

657
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,080
我们没有恶意
We come in peace.

658
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,200
瓦斯凯
Vasquez.

659
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,360
你会说科曼奇语？
You speak Comanche?

660
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,010
会一点
Some.

661
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,520
你会不会
You speak...

662
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,080
白人的英语？
...white man's English?

663
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,840
会一点
Some.

664
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,130
你的部落呢
Where's your tribe?

665
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:09,330
部落长老们说我跟他们不是同路人
The elders told me my path is different.

666
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,920
我们的路也与众不同  我们的路
My path is different, too. My path... Our path.

667
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,160
我们要去对付一个恶人
We go to fight wicked men.

668
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,410
很可能我们都会死
Probably, we all die.

669
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,680
我被称为红色收获
I'm called Red Harvest.

670
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,600
- 他说的什么？  - 他说跟我们一起
- What'd he say?  -Said he's with us.

671
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,200
给他弄点吃的  我已经吃过了
Gonna fix him some breakfast. I had mine.

672
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,320
那就生火吧
Let's get this fire started.

673
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,160


674
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,960


675
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,160


676
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,490
克里斯汀
Kristen.

677
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,520
那人不是善类
That man's trouble.

678
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,000
下午好  各位
Afternoon, gentlemen.

679
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,320
镇上禁止携带枪支
Town's got a ban on firearms.

680
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,800
交出枪  离镇时候再还给你们
Check 'em in. Get 'em back on your way out.

681
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,040
能不能问问  你们怎么都穿的这么体面
You don't mind me asking,but how is it all of you go so well-heeled?

682
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,560
他们都是警员
These men are deputies.

683
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,760
这么个小镇却有这么多警察？
Awful lot of deputies for such a small place, ain't it?

684
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,240
他是什么人
What's his story?

685
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,890
我的仆人  没什么本事
My manservant. He's harmless.

686
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,120
我在上海救了他一命
Saved his life in Shanghai,

687
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,490
他欠了赌债
debt of honor and the like.

688
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,760
你不介意放下枪吧？
Now, you don't mind giving up those guns, do you?

689
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,320
没问题  为了治安嘛
Absolutely. Law and order, I say.

690
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,920
警长？
Sheriff?

691
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,850
我很愿意配合你们交出枪
Now, I must tell you that I'm more than happy to cooperate.

692
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,680
但你们身后的我那些朋友就未必愿意了
I can't say the same thing for my compadres behind you.

693
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,360
不少流浪汉啊
Quite a batch of strays.

694
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,960
我会为你祈祷的  简短的祈祷
I'll say a prayer for you.You know, a little prayer.

695
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,560
可以用你做一块上好的地毯
Yeah, you'll make a hell of a rug.

696
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,330
而你会被杀
And you'll be murdered

697
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,000
被世上最风流的人
by the world's greatest lover.

698
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,690
好吧
All right.

699
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,840
好吧
All right.

700
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,810
你们来这有何目的  先生
What's your aim here, mister?

701
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,480
这个嘛
Well...

702
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,920
我听说这里负责保安的是一群胆小鬼
I hear that there are some cowards running security here,

703
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
所以我们就来这里弄点金子
so I figured we'd come down here and look after all this gold.

704
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,280
胆小鬼？
Cowards?

705
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,320
黑石的警察们  胆小鬼
Blackstone detective agents. Cowards.

706
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,160
黑石人很棒  对抗北军
Now, Blackstones are good,union busting,

707
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,960
勤劳的农民们  不过
back-shooting homesteaders and women, but

708
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,520
你带领他们对抗的  是真正的杀手
you put 'em up against some real men,men that know what they're doing...

709
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,200
不想要我的枪了吗？
You sure you don't want my gun?

710
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,120
你知道我们是谁的人  是吧
Now, you do know who we work for, right?

711
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,200
知道他的能量有多大吧
The force he can bring to bear?

712
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,880
你告诉鲍格
You tell Bogue

713
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,880
如果他想霸占镇子
if he wants his town,

714
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,520
让他来找我
come see me.

715
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,560
看来他没听到你信号
I don't believe he heard you.

716
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,120
去吧  马儿
Go on, horse.

717
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,960
不
No!

718
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,880
魔鬼  别开枪  我只是店老板
Devil, don't shoot. I'm the proprietor.

719
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,200
不
No!

720
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,800
上帝  让我看明白点
Lord, give me clear vision!

721
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,320
看清楚点
Clear sight!

722
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,800
干掉他
Go on, shoot him.

723
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,800
开枪
Take the shot.

724
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,360
开枪
Take that shot.

725
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,800
快他妈开枪啊
Take the damn shot!

726
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,240
把枪给我
Give me that.

727
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,720
子弹堵住 了
It's jammed.

728
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,090
怎么样
How'd we do?

729
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,770
我干掉了5个
I got five.

730
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,640
- 我杀了6个  - 嘿
- I got six.  -Hey.

731
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,200
- 你干掉了几个？  -6个
- What'd you get?  -Six.

732
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,280
我搞定了7个
I got seven.

733
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,640
想比试一下吗？
You wanna try and tie it up?

734
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,320
混蛋
Huh, chingado ?

735
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,720
你定个时间　蠢货
Say when, guero.

736
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,400
嘿
Hey-

737
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,240
出来吧
Come on out of there.

738
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,560
来，出来
Come on. Come on!

739
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,800
解下枪带
Take off that gun belt.

740
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,200
你没事吧
You all right?

741
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,960
好的很
Nice and easy.

742
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,850
徽章也摘下来
Take off that badge, too.

743
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,240
我仍然是警长  正式当选的
I'm still sheriff. Duly elected.

744
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,240
就当是撤职好了
Consider this a recall.

745
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,970
给你老板带个话
Now, you're gonna deliver a message to your boss.

746
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,720
先生  你们这已经给他送话了
Mister, you already sent him a message,

747
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,320
只不过你们不会喜欢他的回答的
only you're not gonna like his answer.

748
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,840
告诉他  他的镇子和整个山谷都在我们手里
Tell him we have his town,we have his whole valley.

749
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,360
如果他想要回去的话  就来找我们谈
He want it back,he's gonna have to make a deal with us.

750
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,250
他不会跟任何人谈交易的  不停你问这里的人
He don't make deals.You can ask anybody here.

751
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,520
他只会派大量的人马来碾平你们
He's just gonna send as many men as it takes to squash you flat.

752
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,680
我们等他来  在此之前  你告诉他
We'll be waiting. In the meantime, you tell him this.

753
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,680
林肯市  林肯总统的林肯  跟着我说
Lincoln. Like the president. Say it.

754
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,440
林肯市  林肯总统的林肯
Lincoln, like the president.

755
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,560
没错  堪萨其州的林肯市
That's right. Lincoln, Kansas.

756
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,360
告诉他  如果他不敢来的话
And you tell him if he don't show up himself,

757
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:41,330
他也只是个胆小鬼
he ain't nothing but a yellow-bellied sapsucking coward.

758
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,600
你走吧
Go on, git.

759
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,040
走吧
Git.

760
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,320
嘿
Hey-

761
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,050
山姆·奇森  念一遍
Sam Chisolm. Say it.

762
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,120
山姆·奇森
Sam Chisolm.

763
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,720
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

764
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,800
真是个热闹的欢迎会
Well, this is quite the welcome party.

765
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,770
- 人都去哪儿了？  - 应该被我们都杀光了吧
- Where is everybody?  -I think we killed 'em all.

766
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,320
不  他们在那
No, they're here.

767
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:19,160
但他们要先确认蜡烛点着了  才敢吹灭火柴
They just want to make sure their candle is lit before they blow out the match.

768
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:30,920
大家都出来  出来吧
Everyone! Come on! Come out!

769
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,080
- 出来  - 大家出来吧
- Come out!\n-Come on out, everybody!

770
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,560
你们都怎么了
What's the matter with y'all?

771
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,320
没看到刚才他们做的事吗？
Don't you see what they just did?

772
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,640
出来吧  出来吧
Come on! Come out!

773
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,920
这些人是来帮我们的
These men are here to help us!

774
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,160
- 出来吧  - 看看这
- Come on!  -Well, look at that.

775
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,640
- 出来吧  - 别害怕
- Come on!  -Nothing to be scared of! Let's go!

776
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,200
- 出来吧    - 他死了吗？
- Come on!    -Is he dead?

777
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,960
别靠近
Come on. Get away.

778
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,240
没事的
It's okay.

779
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,160
来  别害怕
Come on, don't be afraid.

780
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:19,370
我找来了这些人  出价很合理
I have assembled these men and offered fair pay.

781
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,080
谁让你代表我们交易的
Who picked you to deal on our behalf?

782
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,280
但除了我   没人有这个胆量
Seems I was the only one with balls enough to do so.

783
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,760
于是我就去了
So I did.

784
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,010
正如我所说的  这些人是来帮我们的
As I said, these men are here to help us.

785
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,760
奇森先生？
Mr. Chisolm?

786
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,680
我叫山姆·奇森
My name is Sam Chisolm,

787
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,890
堪萨斯州威奇托市正式宣誓的缉拿警察
and I'm a duly sworn warrant officer in Wichita, Kansas.

788
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,000
我也是印第安人州
Also, a licensed peace officer

789
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,840
阿肯色州和其它七个州的合法治安官
in the Indian Territories, Arkansas and seven other states.

790
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,570
今天发生的事
Now, what happened here was

791
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,760
只是一个开始
just an opening skirmish.

792
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,440
真正的大战还在后面
The real battle is yet to come.

793
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:07,040
到时必须是在对我们有利的情况下进行
The idea is that when it comes,it'll be on our terms.

794
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,960
- 对我们有利？   - 这怎么可能
- On our terms?  -Yeah, there's no way in hell.

795
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,720
那个混蛋会带着200人回来把我们都杀了
Son of a bitch'll come back with 200 men\nand slaughter us all.

796
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,800
如果你们想走  可以走
If you want to leave, leave.

797
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,440
但带不走你们的土地
Just don't take anything you didn't bring with you.

798
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,400
要想保住你们的镇子  你们就必须为之战斗
You want to keep your town,you're gonna have to fight for it.

799
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,290
我是来帮助你们的  但你们也要帮我们
Now, we're here to help you,but you got to help us.

800
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,250
我们需要所有人都站出来战斗
We're gonna need every somebody out here to help us fight.

801
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,760
我的天  你意思是我们就在这等他回来报复？
Good Lord! Are you suggesting we wait here to face retaliation?

802
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:33,960
- 他就是这个意思   -什么？
- Hell, yeah, he is.  -What?

803
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:37,240
让他们来吧  我们会做好准备的    -我插一句  先生
- Let 'em come. We'll be ready for 'em.\n-I beg pardon, sir.

804
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,080
我们都想跟他打
The spirit here is willing,

805
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,200
但我们不会打仗啊  -没错
-but we are not killers.  -That's right.

806
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,600
没有人生来就会打仗  但端起枪就不一样了
Most aren't,till they're looking down the barrel of a gun.

807
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,160
我从未对大活人开过枪
Now, I never shot anything that could shoot back at me.

808
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,880
但是这是我们的家园
But this is our home.

809
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,200
- 我肯定要保卫它  -没错
- Damned if I won't defend it.  -That's right.

810
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:54,200
告诉你们  来报复的那些人
And now let me tell you,\nthese men that are coming here,

811
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,640
他们会低估你们
they're gonna underestimate you.

812
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:56,920
这会是他们犯的第一个错误
That'll be their first mistake.

813
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,600
你说的虽然好  但是我们没有足够时间
That's all well and good,but we don't have enough time.

814
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,770
鲍格说他三个星期后回来  而且那还是八天前说的
Bogue said he'd be back in three weeks,that was eight days ago.

815
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,200
一个星期  - 我们只有...  不  才一个星期？
- One week.  -That only leaves us... No, one week?

816
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,960
一个星期？  一个星期？
- One week?  -One week.

817
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,160
去萨克拉门托报信需要三天
Three days' ride to Sacramento with the bad news,

818
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,480
鲍格做安排需要一天  回这里需要三天
one day for Bogue to plan, three days back.

819
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,050
你们只有七天时间
Seven days, that's all you got.

820
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,840
我的天哪
For goodness' sake.

821
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,720
我们明早就开始训练  今晚好好休息吧
We'll get started in the morning. Get a good night's rest.

822
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,040
这几天有你们累的
May be your last for a while.

823
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,400
我再要些豆子
I'll have some more beans.

824
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,600
感觉就像动物园里被观赏的动物
Like being in one of them damn zoos.

825
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,720
虚名只是浮云
Fame is a sarcophagus.

826
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,650
你这是在书上看的，还是你现编的
You read those in a book,or you just make 'em up as you go?

827
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,360
今后我尽量只用单音节词
I'll try to use one-syllable words from now on.

828
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,640
什么...音节是什么？
What... What's a syllable?

829
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,210
白人吃的东西
White people's food...

830
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,720
是用来喂狗的
...is for dogs.

831
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,960
他说什么？
What'd he say?

832
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:37,560
他让你别再盯着他的额头看了
He asked that you kindly stop staring at his hairline.

833
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,880
好吧
I will.

834
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,530
只要他别看着我的额头流口水
As long as he stops licking his lips over mine.

835
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,880
这些尸体没资格葬在教堂墓地
These bodies don't get buried in the church graveyard.

836
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,480
你都拉去公墓吧
You take 'em to Boot Hill.

837
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,130
天黑之前我们应该可以走10英里
I expect we'll make ten miles by sundown.

838
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,600
看来这能殡葬所大赚一笔的
I suppose that undertaker's\ngonna get some business out of this deal.

839
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:08,240
我向你们保证  没什么可害怕的
I guarantee you, there ain't no reason to be running off scared.

840
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,920
真不想看到你们就这么走了
Hate to see y'all go like this, now.

841
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,160
你们不重新考虑一下吗
Now, now, won't you reconsider?

842
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,800
没想到我们大老远来到这里
Who'd have thought we'd travel this many miles

843
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:32,760
结果却是玫瑰溪的人都走了  留下我们送死
just to have the good people of Rose Creek turn tail and leave us to die?

844
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:36,680
这里的土地难道不值得他们拼命吗？
Well, some people have died for much less.

845
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:47,050
瞧
Behold.

846
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,200
我们的队伍正走来
Our army approaches.

847
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:58,880
太好了  他们带来了干草叉  我们有希望打赢了
Good, they brought their pitchforks.\nWe may stand a chance after all.

848
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,880
上帝  请不要审判我
Lord, keep me from judgment.

849
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,880
把枪放在肩膀上  右肩
Gun on your shoulder. Right shoulder.

850
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,080
刀  其实并不难
Knives. There's nothing to it.

851
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,680
天哪
Oh, boy.

852
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,240
你们谁参加过南北战争
Who here fought in the War of Northern Aggression?

853
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:30,960
我没有
Not me.

854
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,480
这是什么？  拜托
What is this? Come on.

855
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,000
甩
Throw.

856
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,600
砍
Slash.

857
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,120
捅  就这几招
Stab. That's it.

858
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,720
就这么简单
That simple.

859
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,640
我的天  - 嘿
- Like hell.  -Hey.

860
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,560
- 这玩意谁能学得会？  - 都回来
- How the hell we gonna learn to do that?  -Get back here!

861
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,840
回来
Get back!

862
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,360
开枪
Fire!

863
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,760
上帝都看哭了
Jesus wept!

864
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,000
装弹
Reload!

865
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,280
就算乱放枪  也总该打中一个吧
Statistically speaking,they should've hit something.

866
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,120
你们开始惹我上火了
Y'all starting to piss me off.

867
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,400
说多少次了  脚下要踩稳
How many times I got to tell you to keep your foot up underneath you?

868
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,290
拜托  老师 把你的帽子摘了
Come on, now.Schoolteacher, take your hat off your head.

869
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,480
天啊
Jesus!

870
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:24,960
泰迪
Teddy...

871
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,960
我本来对你很有期望的
Expect more from you, son.

872
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,210
不是要躲避后坐力  是要吸收它
The recoil is not to be shunned,it's to be absorbed.

873
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,520
我可什么都不躲避
I ain't shunning a damn thing, sir.

874
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,880
你是要逼我发火吗？
You trying to make me angry? Is that what it is?

875
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,400
你...
Do you...

876
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,920
这是你第二次走火了
That's the second time for you.

877
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,720
- 去给我做份煎蛋  - 是因为击锤
- Go make me some eggs.  -The damn hammer...

878
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,240
我不想听  你回去吧
No, I don't wanna hear it! Have a nice afternoon.

879
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,970
干什么  你要把枪指着我？
You gonna point... You gonna point that rifle at me?

880
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,160
不  先生
No, sir.

881
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,720
就算割掉骡子耳朵  也变不成马
You cut the ears off a mule,don't make him a horse.

882
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,480
- 把枪留下  -我是为了帮你们  听见了吗
- Leave your weapon.  -I'm trying to help you. You understand?

883
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:58,080
瞄准要轻  扣扳机要慢
Keep the target soft, pull the trigger slow.

884
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:01,130
- 慢到你没法更慢  - 像这样吗？
- So slow. You can't pull it slow enough.-Like that?

885
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,160
让枪声吓你一跳
Let the shot surprise you.

886
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,120
好了
All right, now.

887
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,690
准备好了就开枪
Fire when ready.

888
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,040
开枪
Fire!

889
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,360
我的手指被夹住了
Think I pinched my finger.

890
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,160
上帝保佑他们吧
Bless their hearts.

891
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,570
这也太难了
That's hard to do.

892
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,530
这么多人  居然没打中一个靶子
This many men and miss that many targets?

893
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,600
还是两轮
Twice?

894
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,890
我面前是一群死人啊
I'm looking at a line of dead men.

895
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:33,320
要对你们开枪的目标充满恨意
You gotta hate what you're firing at!

896
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,000
仇恨它  拜托
Hate it! Come on!

897
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,760
都上点心吧
Get some gravel in your crawl

898
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,640
该死的
Goddamn sons of bitches!

899
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:40,760
好
All right.

900
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,360
这些人需要启迪
These men need inspiration.

901
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,120
- 启迪一下他们  - 得了
- Inspire them.  -Yeah.

902
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,200
毕竟你是古德奈特·罗比索
You are Goodnight Robicheaux, after all.

903
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,690
不是吗
Aint'cha?

904
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,680
我能打中沙粒  但没必要浪费子弹
I can hit sand, but we need the lead.

905
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,330
他在安提特姆战役中干掉了23个人
Twenty-three confirmed kills at Antietam.

906
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,840
是康纳利的南军中的神枪手之一
This is one of Connolly's Confederate sharpshooters.

907
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,760
绰号“死亡天使”
Dubbed "the Angel of Death."

908
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,400
他给你们示范一下
Do what he does.

909
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,570
他可是个传奇人物
He's a legend.

910
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,840
是不是
Or is that all you are?

911
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,440
真是好枪法
- That's some fancy shooting there. -He did it. He did it.

912
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,800
难怪别人叫他古德奈特了
- That's why they call him Goodnight.  -You're telling me.

913
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,600
- 真不敢相信  太厉害了
- Can you believe that?  -That's fantastic.

914
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,560
我说的没错吧
Told you.

915
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:53,320
你们都回去擦擦枪  也许枪的亮光就能把他们吓跑
Y'all go home, polish your rifles,maybe the glint'll scare 'em off.

916
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,320
今天不练了吗
We ain't gonna shoot no more?

917
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,760
这里就是我们的陷阱
So this is our trap.

918
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,320
应该可以把敌人挡在这里
It might work. Pin 'em in there.

919
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:18,400
应该可以  但前提是能让镇上大半的人
Well, it might, if we can teach more than half of these townsfolk

920
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,250
学会如何打中十步之外的一面墙
to hit the broad side of a barn at ten paces.

921
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:23,160
搞几处埋伏
Come up with a few surprises.

922
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,040
要多搞几处
We'll need more than a few.

923
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,920
这就是个死亡之盒
It's a box of death.

924
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,800
那就用炽热的温度去融化各种元素
So melt the elements, with fervent heat.

925
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,880
就像圣经里的索多玛和蛾摩拉城
Like Sodom and Gomorrah.

926
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,240
你怎么看
What do you think?

927
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,040
这情形就像我以前认识的一个人
Reminds me of this fella I used to know.

928
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,000
他从五楼的房顶上摔下
Fell off a five-story building.

929
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,480
一路砸穿了每一层楼板
Passed each floor on the way down.

930
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,680
房里的人听到他喊“我暂时还行”
People inside heard him say,"So far, so good!"

931
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,200
他现在死了  -是啊
- He's dead now.  -Yeah.

932
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,840
- 我做的对得起你帮我买马了吗？山姆
I make good on my horse yet, Sam?

933
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,680
暂时还行  我们去搞些弹药
So far, so good. Let's go get some ammo.

934
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:05,800
走吧
Come on.

935
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,960
鲍格先生要求在他回来前把矿采开
Mr. Bogue wants this mine stripped before he gets back.

936
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,090
快点  你们这些懒货
Move it, you lazy dogs!

937
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,040
把金子采出来
Move that gold out!

938
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,880
小心放炮
Fire in the hole!

939
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,490
好像是枪声
That sounded like a gunshot!

940
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,410
从悬崖上传来的
It's coming from the cliff.

941
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,930
-是谁啊  -不知道\n-Who was that？ -I don't know.

942
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,160
-先别放炮了  -看那里
-Keep the powder down.  -Look it,right there.

943
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,280
他们不是鲍格的人
These ain't Bogue's guys.

944
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,560
是啊  他们已经把他们都杀了
Yup. They done killed them all.

945
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,680
现在金矿关闭
This mine is now closed.

946
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,160
你们可以走了
You men are free to go.

947
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,930
当然也可以留下来战斗
Or you can stay and fight.

948
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,520
这些炸药用得上  - 是啊
- This will help.  -Yeah.

949
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,600
我一直想炸点什么玩玩
I've always wanted to blow something up.

950
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,250
快回屋子里去
Go back inside.

951
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,360
奇森先生  这是什么？
Mr. Chisolm, what's this?

952
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,080
是援兵
Reinforcements.

953
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,200
- 马车上是什么？  - 炸药
- What's that on the wagon?  -Dynamite.

954
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,850
炸药？你们要放在哪
Dynamite? Where you gonna put that stuff?

955
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:56,280
- 放你家    -我家？为什么是我家？
- Your place.  -My place? Why my place?

956
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,200
天哪  你们一定要小心点
Oh, Lord. Please be careful with it.

957
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:21,240
我的镇子  我的金子  怎么会这样？
My town. My gold. How?

958
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:24,320
他们来的太突然了  鲍格先生  我没法...
It was happening so fast, Mr. Bogue,I couldn't...

959
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,880
我们人手不够
There just wasn't enough.

960
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,760
还说我是胆小鬼？
And that I'd be a coward?

961
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:35,360
如果你不去玫瑰溪的话
If you didn't come to Rose Creek. Yes, sir.

962
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,680
- 他说他叫奇森对吗？   -山姆奇森
- He said his name was Chisolm?  -Sam Chisolm.

963
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,000
- 来自林肯？  -林肯总统的林肯
- From Lincoln?  -Like the president.

964
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,520
他说要多少钱了吗？
He name his price?

965
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,680
没说要钱  只开了条件
He didn't have one. Just terms.

966
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,050
人人都能用钱收买  是不是 哈普先生
All men have a price. Isn't that right, Mr. Harp?

967
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,520
这个人不是
Not this man.

968
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,360
他们有多少人？
How many men you say?

969
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,240
- 七个  -七个？七个？
- Seven.  -Seven? Seven?

970
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,680
七个人骑马来到我镇上
Seven men ride into my town,

971
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,720
干掉22个顶尖的雇佣枪手？
dispatch with 22 of the best guns money can buy?

972
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:16,840
是这样吗
Is that what you're telling me?

973
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,720
他们一个顶三个  鲍格先生
They fought like three times that, Mr. Bogue.

974
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,600
胡扯  他们只不过打了个出其不意而已
Bullshit. it was nothing but the element of surprise.

975
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,050
嘿
Hey-

976
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,490
出其不意
Surprise.

977
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,440
你以为洛克菲勒需要亲自干吗
You think Rockefeller had to do things himself?

978
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,560
范德比尔特
Vanderbilt?

979
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:42,210
而我的一切都是我一手干出来的
Everything I have, I worked for it.

980
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:47,040
不像他们有上流社会的朋友和效力的政客
Not like them, with their fancy friends and their pocketed politicians.

981
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,480
你知道我要那片土地
I want land, you know what I do.

982
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,680
我就要抢到
I take it.

983
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:54,600
你知道历史书上会怎么记载玫瑰溪吗？
You know what history will say about Rose Creek?

984
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,200
没任何记载
Nothing.

985
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,680
很长时间内都不会有这个地方
It won't have existed for long enough.

986
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,640
但是历史会记住我
But history will remember me,

987
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,680
记住我的成就
and what I built.

988
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:10,440
德纳利先生  召集一批人马  跟我们一起杀回去
Mr. Denali,recruit an army to go back with us.

989
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,320
漂亮
Pretty.

990
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,280
我是说你打的漂亮
I mean good.

991
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,530
你枪法很好  再来一次
Your shooting is good. Do it again.

992
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,840
盯着准星最下端  下巴靠在...
Sight the lowest part of the V,cheek resting against the...

993
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,400
我父亲教过我  谢谢
I had a father, thank you.

994
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,560
我爸可没教过
I didn't.

995
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:02,370
天  我厉害吧
God dang it, I'm good.

996
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,840
你为何做这件事  法拉第先生
Why are you doing this, Mr. Faraday?

997
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:08,080
我是说  你为何来这里
I mean, why are you here

998
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:11,000
帮别人打仗
fighting someone else's fight?

999
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,210
我想要回我的马  这就是我的代价
I needed my horse back,and this was the price.

1000
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:19,680
轻轻扣一下扳机  就能杀死一个人
Six pounds of pressure.That's all that's required to kill a man.

1001
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,800
但会留下一生的噩梦
And they say the nightmares never go away.

1002
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:29,040
你经常会被这样的噩梦惊醒吗  法拉第先生
Those nightmares,they keep you up often, Mr. Faraday?

1003
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,520
如果你真要战斗的话  最好换上裤子
You might want to wear some pants if you're fixing to fight.

1004
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,120
鲍格会从南边过来
Bogue will come from the south.

1005
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,360
他喜欢占据高地
Now, he'll prefer high ground,

1006
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,800
但我们要把他引到镇上  把镇子变成靶场
but we'll try to lure him into town,turn it into a shooting gallery.

1007
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:52,090
只要制造足够的混乱  那我们就能打散他们的阵形
Now, if we can create enough confusion,\nmaybe we can get them to break ranks.

1008
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,760
这儿地形很开阔啊  山姆
That's a lotta open space here, Sam.

1009
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,410
没办法把他们挡在镇外
I don't really see a way to keep 'em out.

1010
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,800
不用挡  我们放他们进来
We're not. We're gonna let 'em in.

1011
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:06,040
对我们把他们赶到这里  离开这片空地
Yes, yes, we force 'em down through here,\nleave this open here,

1012
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,120
把这变成墓地
make this into a graveyard.

1013
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,320
古德奈特  你的来福枪枪法最好
Goodnight, you're our best shot with a rifle.

1014
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,720
你找个视线清晰的高处
You find high ground that gives you a clear line of sight,

1015
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,530
交战开始后  你要盯紧了鲍格
you keep Bogue in your sights once the chaos starts.

1016
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,960
我们还有些散弹枪
Now, we have some shotguns.

1017
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:20,640
可以把枪法差的人安排在每家每户门前
We can get the men who can't shoot,place 'em in front of each door.

1018
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,440
门口很难打不中
It's hard to miss a doorway.

1019
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:25,490
我们可以挖战壕  一直挖到到那里
We could dig trenches.Shoot all the way out that way.

1020
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,760
去这样的高处  麻烦就在于你下不来
Trouble with taking one of these positions,you can't ever get down.

1021
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,810
无论如何都不能放跑鲍格
Now, whatever happens, Bogue can't leave.

1022
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:33,840
何以见得鲍格一定会来？
How do we even know Bogue's gonna show?

1023
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,880
- 他会来的  -如果他把你一枪打死了呢
- He'll show.-And if he just shoots you in the head?

1024
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,080
那你们也打死他  随便  给我报仇就是了
Then just shoot him in the head.Hell, I don't know, avenge me.

1025
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:45,000
只要能把他们引进来  关门打狗
If we can lure him into the bottleneck,\nclose the door behind him,

1026
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:47,320
每一批人边开火边逼进   我们就有胜算了
each group fire and advance,we stand a chance.

1027
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:51,850
如果出现最坏的情况  我们败了  那就把金矿炸了
Worst-case scenario,all is lost and we blow the mine.

1028
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,090
这里是最好的地点
This right here is the best spot.

1029
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,640
可以在上面安排人吗？牢固吗？
Can we take position up there? Is it safe?

1030
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,320
那上面有地方站吗
Anything left up there to stand on?

1031
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:04,080
祈祷上帝宽恕就不用跑那么远了
Won't have to go too far to pray for forgiveness.

1032
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,320
说的好
There you go.

1033
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:12,240
但你这样的人是不会被宽恕的   白人
But there is no forgiveness for men like you, guero.

1034
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,010
别叫我白人
Don't call me guero.

1035
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,650
白人是什么意思
What's guero mean, anyway?

1036
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:20,320
- 英俊？有风度？  -差不多
- Handsome? Debonair?  -Yeah, something like that.

1037
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,000
不  这是我们的据点
No, this is our stronghold.

1038
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,840
你带他们都去教堂
You funnel them all towards the church.

1039
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,040
我在哪
Where am I?

1040
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,400
你照顾好妇女儿童们
You keep the women and children safe and out of harm...

1041
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,760
我要参战
I aim to fight.

1042
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,880
到了需要你参战的地步  说明我们都战死了
Well, if it comes to that,then we're all dead, ain't we?

1043
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,680
但愿我们死前已经忏悔过了
Let's hope if we die, we've confessed.

1044
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,360
古德奈特
Goody.

1045
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,200
你还好吧
You all right?

1046
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:59,640
要多远  山姆  大约50或75码外？
What do you say, Sam,about 50 or 75 yards out?

1047
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,560
就在这里挖壕沟
That's our trench.

1048
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:06,450
在两边一起挖  其他的人都站在旁边
Ditches on each side! The rest of y'all stand to the side!

1049
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,840
马车行旁边也要挖一条壕沟   看这里
We're gonna need another ditch by the livery.   See that?

1050
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,640
很好  拉
Good, and heave!

1051
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:22,240
- 好  现在绑上  -要把枪
- All right, tie it up, now.  -Put your weapon...

1052
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,040
一定要涂满了
Make sure you paint the whole thing.

1053
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,120
在炸弹旁边吸烟？很好
Very smart, smoking, huh?

1054
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,600
- 三分钟  - 这距离可不短
- Three minutes.  -That's too much land to cover.

1055
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,120
鸡蛋是哪儿来的
Where did them eggs come from?

1056
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,800
来自鸡屁股啊  你这个笨蛋
A chicken's ass, you dummy.

1057
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,480
我跟你们介绍过我老婆吗？
Did I introduce you to my wife?

1058
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:41,360
她叫艾塞尔  我非常爱她
Her name is Ethel, and I love her.

1059
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,680
你好  艾塞尔  你真漂亮
Hello, Ethel. Charmed.

1060
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:47,160
我把她看作一生之恋
And I consider her to be the love of my life.

1061
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,920
她可不扯犊子
And she is a no-bullshitter,

1062
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,920
是个直脾气   -好了 别闹了
-she's a straight shooter.  -All right, calm down, now.

1063
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,000
把枪收起来  年轻人
Put the gun away, son.

1064
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:56,320
她叫艾塞尔  -把枪收起来
- Her name is Ethel.  -Put it away.

1065
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,360
你要尊重她
And you'll show her some goddamn respect.

1066
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,770
好的
Yeah.

1067
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,120
你可以不尊重玛利亚
It's Maria you can disrespect.

1068
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:05,720
我和玛利亚的事别告诉艾塞尔
Don't tell Ethel about Maria.

1069
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,240
等等  你说的是我的玛利亚？
Wait, wait, wait. My Maria, cabron?

1070
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,160
你也有个玛利亚？
You have a Maria?

1071
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,160
我有三个玛利亚！
I have three Marias!

1072
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,520
这不得体
That's not right.

1073
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,720
猫头鹰跟着我来了
The owl followed me here.

1074
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,960
- 没什么跟着你  - 我听到那声音了
- Nothing's following you.  -I heard the voice.

1075
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,160
- 古德奈特  -我听到那声音了
- Goody...  -I heard the voice.

1076
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:33,890
- 古德奈特  -比利  我听到了
- Goody.  -Billy, I heard it.

1077
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:38,240
我再用枪杀人的话  我会死的惨不忍睹  比利
I pull that trigger in violence again,I'm gonna die a ghastly death, Billy.

1078
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,890
我听到了
I heard it.

1079
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,840
- 一回事？  -这不是一回事
- Same thing, it's not the same thing.  -Yeah, it is.

1080
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:47,360
不 女人是女人  枪就是枪  不是一回事
No, a woman's a woman,a gun's a gun, in the Lord's eye.

1081
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,120
那只是噩梦  古德奈特
They're just dreams, Goody.

1082
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,040
要么谈枪  要么谈女人
You talk about guns, you talk about women,

1083
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,920
两者要分开谈  这样不得体
you talk about 'em separately. it ain't right.

1084
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,440
当然得体  我的朋友
Sure it is. Sure it is, my friend.

1085
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,480
我曾经有过老婆
I had a wife once.

1086
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:03,000
有过家庭  还有几个孩子
Had a family. Had some children, too.

1087
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,880
有过
One time.

1088
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,360
我估计这针线能比你活的更长
Now the stitching'll outlast you, I imagine.

1089
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,720
你太客气了
That's... That's very nice of you.

1090
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,800
我没开口让你缝的
I didn't ask you to do that.

1091
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:15,680
我也没让你开口
I didn't ask you to ask.

1092
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,930
你别盯着看了
You quit staring.

1093
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,360
我没开口让她缝的
I didn't ask her to do that.

1094
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,520
人家用针头在你的衣服上又抽又插的
Well, the lady just did some poking and sticking for you.

1095
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:29,160
你是不是也该用你的小针头给她又抽又插的？
Maybe you should consider returning the favor, you know?

1096
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,530
好了  好了
Okay, all right.

1097
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:56,040
-晚上好  奇森先生   -神父
- Evening, Mr. Chisolm.  -Preacher.

1098
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,240
- 多么美好的夜晚  -是的
- What a beautiful night it is. -Yes, it is.

1099
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:05,360
我只想抽时间来这里
I just wanted to take a moment to come up here

1100
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:10,080
感谢你为我们做的这些事
and to thank you for everything that you've done for us.

1101
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:14,720
我们很久没享受过这样的夜晚了
It's been a long while since we've been able to enjoy an evening quite like tonight.

1102
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,770
在你们来之前
Before you and your men arrived,

1103
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:20,600
我们的日常娱乐都被夺走了
all of our everyday pleasures had been taken from us.

1104
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,440
能够找回这样的日子  哪怕只有一晚
To have those back, even if only for a moment,

1105
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,000
对你来说可能不算什么
well, it might not mean that much to you,

1106
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:31,090
但我们都对你特别感激
but, by God,we are all eternally grateful to you.

1107
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:34,160
有些事你不知道  神父
More than you know, preacher.

1108
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:39,920
我最不想玩扑克了
Last thing I wanna be doing is playing cards.

1109
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,650
- 一整夜  - 一整夜
- All night. -All night.

1110
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,760
这些人中  有一些无法活下去
You know, some of these folks ain't gonna make it.

1111
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,800
是啊
Yeah.

1112
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,600
-来  慢点  慢点  -稳住
- Here we go. Easy. Easy.  -Steady.

1113
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,960
把绳子另一头扔给我
- Throw me the other end!  -Here you go.

1114
01:26:58,800 --> 01:26:59,840
好了
Okay, pues.

1115
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,960
-够了吗？  -好了
- That far enough?  -That'll do!

1116
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:07,800
好 再来两三下就可以了
All right, two or three more of those,then we're good.

1117
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:09,760
好的
That's it, right there.

1118
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:13,400
看  看
Look. Look. Look.

1119
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,680
小心碰头  泰迪
Watch your head now, Teddy.

1120
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,320
现在你可以为我们祈祷了  神父
Now you can pray for us, Father.

1121
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:27,000
兄弟  我会为你祈祷的  直到我忘了怎样祈祷
My brother, I will pray for you until I forget how to pray.

1122
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,680
喝水吗？奇森先生
Water, Mr. Chisolm?

1123
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,610
这是玫瑰溪历史上重要的一天
This is a grand day in the history books of Rose Creek!

1124
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,120
上帝保佑你  奇森先生
God bless you, Mr. Chisolm, sir.

1125
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,120
这是正当的  兄弟姐妹们
Vindication, brothers and sisters!

1126
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:40,720
- 喝水吗  霍恩先生  -谢谢你 小姐
- Water, Mr. Horne?  -Thank you, miss.

1127
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,800
为了上帝的荣耀
For God's glory!

1128
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,520
鲍格带着人马来了
Bogue comes with his men.

1129
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:06,800
什么时候到
When?

1130
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,640
明天一早
Dawn.

1131
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:43,520
上帝说  只要有两三个人奉我的名聚会
The Lord said, "Where there are two or three gathered in My name,

1132
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:44,880
我就会在他们中间
"I will be there."

1133
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,690
你还没拿到你的那份金子就要走了？
You just gonna run off before you get your cut of the gold?

1134
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:21,080
明天你们都会死的  山姆
Well, y'all gonna be dead this time tomorrow, Sam.

1135
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:24,720
我相信人人都有权利自己死在什么地方
I believe every man's got the right to choose where he dies, if he can.

1136
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:29,480
这话或许能忽悠他们几个人
Well, that kind of talk may work with these other sons of bitches,

1137
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:31,210
但我知道你为何来这里
but I know why you're here.

1138
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,120
你不是为了为民除害
And it's not for the benefit of mankind.

1139
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,280
你抛下了这些人  古德
You run out on these people, Goody,

1140
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:40,120
对你失望的  将不只是他们或者我
and you gonna be disappointing more than just them or me.

1141
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,720
还记得北军士兵毒打我的时候
Remember what you said to me when them Billy Yanks

1142
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,760
你对我说过的话吗
were kicking my sorry ass six ways to Sunday?

1143
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,330
-我记得  -是吗
- I remember.  -Yeah?

1144
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,440
你问我为什么救你这么一个南军士兵
You asked me why I wanted to save a piece of rebel trash like you,

1145
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:55,800
我对你说战争结束了
and I told you the war was over.

1146
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,040
-但并未结束  -不 结束了
- But it ain't over, Sam.  -Yes, it is.

1147
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:59,520
没有  杀戮并未结束
No, it isn't. No, the killing's not over.

1148
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:03,080
还在继续着  一遍又一遍
It keeps going on and on and on.

1149
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:07,440
- 我见过那么多死亡  -战争已经结束了
- I seen so much death.  -The war is over

1150
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,320
对我俩来说都是
for both of us.

1151
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:12,440
在战火中失去的
What we lost in the fire,

1152
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,040
还能在灰烬中找到
we'll find in the ashes.

1153
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,120
我需要你
I need you.

1154
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,770
我已经变成了我鄙视的人
I've become everything I despise. I...

1155
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:31,080
成了个懦弱的胆小鬼
I'm faint-hearted and I'm a coward.

1156
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,400
再见
Bye.

1157
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,680
只记住以前的我吧
You remember me as I was.

1158
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:47,720
走吧
Come on.

1159
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,920
愿人尊你的名为圣
...hallowed be Thy name.

1160
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,490
愿你的国降临
Thy kingdom come,

1161
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,840
您你的旨意行
Thy will be done,

1162
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,240
在地上如同行在天上
on Earth as it is in heaven.

1163
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,800
我们日用的饮食  今日赐给我们
Give us this day our daily bread

1164
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,960
免我们的债
and forgive us our trespasses...

1165
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,400
你们没事吧
You all right?

1166
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,480
怎么
Well...

1167
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:28,080
比利呢
Where's Billy?

1168
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,240
看来他又开始喝酒了
It looks like he's started to drink.

1169
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,200
那好
All right. Well...

1170
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,240
如果还有谁想走  现在正是时候
Anybody else want to leave, now's the time.

1171
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,440
没人会怪你
No one'll hold no ill will towards you.

1172
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,960
那你呢
What about you?

1173
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,640
我...
I...

1174
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:47,240
我要坚持到最后
I believe I'm gonna see this through.

1175
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:49,200
要让镇民们找回以前的生活
These people deserve their lives back.

1176
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:56,520
我没别的地方可去  所以我留下
I have nowhere else to go, so I'm in.

1177
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:00,490
我们知道  明天会是血腥的一天
You know, I knew that tomorrow was gonna be a dark day.

1178
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:04,000
现在又少了一个人  会更血腥
And now that there's one less of us,gonna be darker.

1179
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:09,320
但能够服务人民
But to be in the service of others

1180
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:13,520
跟你们这些汉子们一起
with men that I respect,

1181
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,120
并肩战斗
like you all...

1182
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,760
我已经心满意足了
Well, I shouldn't have to ask for more than that.

1183
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:55,280
- 我们明早见  -好
- I'll see you in the morning. -All right.

1184
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,120
我饿了
I'm hungry-

1185
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,120
等等  你会说英语？
Wait. Hell, you speak English?

1186
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:04,280
那又如何
So?

1187
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,800
你这小混蛋  那我们有很多要聊的
You little shit. We got a lot to talk about.

1188
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,040
你别走啊
Don't walk away from me!

1189
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,960
我来顶替他
I'll take his place.

1190
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:48,120
-顶替谁  -晚安
- Who?  -Goodnight.

1191
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:52,120
我看到他骑马走了
Just saw him ride out.

1192
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:31,640
谢谢你赋予我的力量
Thank you for the strength that you have given me.

1193
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:38,200
到时候了
It's time.

1194
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:39,640
快点  孩子们
Come on, children!

1195
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:41,050
快  孩子们  快

1200
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:52,920
小心台阶
Watch your step.

1201
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:08,720
稳住  稳住
Easy, easy.

1202
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:10,880
稳住
Steady.

1203
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,250
稳住
Easy now, easy.

1204
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:33,850
是奇森？

1347
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:56,720

- Come on. Stay together.  -Let's go! Go, go, go.

1348

别停下  去山脊线

1349
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:00,170
走  一直走

1350
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:01,880
趴下  趴下
Get down. Get down!

1351
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,360
走  走
Come on. Come on.

1352
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:20,160
趴下
Get down!

1353
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:21,840
他们来了
They're coming!

1354
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:23,920
我们没弹药了  伙计
We're running outta ammo, boys!

1355
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:27,360
-该死的  比利  -我就知道你会回来
- Shit, Billy.  -I knew you'd come back.

1356
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:30,930
你知道？  你怎么知道的
You did, did you? How'd you know that?

1357
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:34,240
你忘了这个

- All right. Let's do it.  -Yeah!

1359
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:38,000
你是我们中的败类
You're a disgrace.

1360
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:13,490
去那边  去那边
Over there! Over there!

1361
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:15,600
弹药  弹药
Ammo, ammo!

1362
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,000
就这些了
This is all we've got.

1363
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:22,290
这让我想起我爸以前常说的话
This reminds me of what my daddy used to say.

1364
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:24,680
什么话  古德
What's that, Goody?

1365

什么
What?

1366
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:33,360
我爸说过的话多了
Well, my daddy used to say a lot of things, you know.

1367
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:40,200

暂时还行
So far, so good.

1369
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:43,730
但我要换个马甲了
I might need a new vest.

1370
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:48,720
我们必须干掉那挺机枪
Damn, we gotta do something about that gun.

1371
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:02,440
嘿
Hey-

1372

You know what?

1373
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:06,160
我们扯平了
We're even.

1374
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:08,000
那马是你的了  你不欠我的了
For the horse. You don't owe me anything.

1375
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:10,360
但你欠我的

1376
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:12,760
欠你什么
What's that?

1377
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:14,560
掩护
Cover.

1378
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:17,130
快  快
Come on! Come on!

1379
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:37,200
到这边来
Over here!

1380
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:39,920
到这边  古德
This side, Goody.

1381
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,080
快  法拉第  快
Ride, Faraday, ride!

1382
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:47,880

1383
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:05,010

瞄准教堂顶部

1385
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:19,320
我打中他了

1386
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:37,000
古德
Goody.

1387
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:48,160
来啊
Come on, boy!

1388
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:02,440
还爬起来？
Why don't you stay down, boy?

1389
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:54,760
我们走
Let's go, boys.

1390
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:56,480
好  好
Yeah. Yeah.

1391
01:56:58,120 --> 01:56:59,120

我知道这名字吗
Should I know that name?

1398
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:17,640
你会从你的讣告上看到
You should know it from your obituary.

1399
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:22,240
我们有关系？

1405
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:46,600
上帝让他们成为绵羊
If God didn't want 'em sheared,

1406
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:48,760
就是让我剪羊毛的
he wouldn't have made 'em sheep.

1407
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,040

好
Yeah.

1413
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:27,050
请你走吧
Please, just leave.

1414
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:33,880
请放过我  求你了
Please leave me be! Please!

1415
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:40,200
求你
Please.

1416
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:43,200
我求你饶恕
I... I beg your pardon.

1417
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:47,560
是我对不起你
I've done you wrong.

1418
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:48,970

1419
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:54,890
我要你跟我一起祈祷

被他们吊起来
That they strung up.

1432
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:37,680
他们把绳子套在我脖子上的时候祈祷了吗
Did they pray when they put the rope around my neck?

1433
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:39,120
他们祈祷了吗

杀了我也不会让你得到满足的
Killing me won't give you the satisfaction you want!

1442

That's all right. As long as I can walk, I'll be fine.

1467

不管他们以前是什么人
Whatever they were in life,

1468
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:54,640
到最后
here, at the end,

1469
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:58,920
每个人都是勇敢光荣的
each man stood with courage and honor.

1470
02:08:00,440 --> 02:08:04,160
他们为那些无力自卫的人而战
They fought for the ones who couldn't fight for themselves,

1471
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:06,280
也为他们而牺牲
and they died for them, too.

1472
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:10,400
只是为了赢得并不属于他们的东西
All to win something that didn't belong to them.

1473
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:13,570
这是
It was

1474
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:16,280
很高尚的
magnificent.
