1
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,834
Go on!

2
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,176
Seem a little lonely. Need some company?

3
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,576
Make some time for you, little missy.

4
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,989
- Yeah!
- Come on, move! Get out of the way!

5
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,678
- Hurry.
- Quickly.

6
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
Hurry.

7
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,519
- Move it!
- Come on, come on!

8
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,068
- Get out of the way, now!
- Come on.

9
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,554
Fire in the hole!

10
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,189
Another wagon coming from town!

11
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,350
That's Mr. Bogue's gold!

12
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,078
Hyah! Hyah!

13
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,952
Hyah!

14
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,471
Move. Get out of the way!

15
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,708
Out of the road!

16
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,199
This gold's heavy.

17
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,874
- Must be a lot in there.
- You folks stay back!

18
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,712
Stay away from the gold!

19
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,776
- Get right inside. You, get up there!
- Get going!

20
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,313
There's more gold in the wagon.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,070
Hurry up. Get the rest of those cases.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,833
Ain't right how these
men are being treated.

23
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,399
They fought in the war.

24
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,358
- Whoa. Whoa!
- Line your asses up and get paid.

25
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,471
- All right, let's go.
- Let's go! Move!

26
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,431
- All right, boys, line up.
- Move. Come on!

27
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,351
Get that wagon back to the mine.

28
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,274
Let's move! Move!

29
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,588
What about our water?

30
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,877
Bogue's gonna come back,
and he's gonna try and take this land.

31
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,016
- What about our families?
- What about Bogue?

32
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,632
Hey, calm down! Calm down!

33
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,233
Our crops are dying!

34
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,920
He's telling us that the water's poison?

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,080
- It's a lie!
- It is a lie.

36
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,616
Otherwise, why does he have Blackstones
keeping us away from it?

37
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,120
- He's just a man, Turner.
- He's a man with an army, Phillips!

38
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,096
- He's a man with a claim to mine a mountain.
- He's trying to run us out of town.

39
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,936
And his miners are camping
on the edge of our town!

40
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,440
A man seizing our land.

41
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,631
A man with dozens of hired guns
on his payroll.

42
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
We know that, Turner.

43
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,189
- Who's gonna stand up to a man like that?
- We will.

44
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,616
- But how? With what?
- We're just farmers.

45
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,834
To Bogue?

46
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,161
- There are laws on our side.
- Bogue is the law, Matthew.

47
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,475
Bought and paid for.

48
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,456
- Even got our sheriff on his payroll!
- And his deputies.

49
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,153
- And that's why I say we fight.
- I say we fight. Yeah.

50
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,896
I ain't fighting,
and I ain't leaving neither.

51
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,776
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- God will provide.

52
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,856
That is right, Brother Phillip.
The Lord surely will provide.

53
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,269
Now, now. Bogue is a businessman.

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,616
If you just reason with him...

55
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,993
...he'll give you a fair share.

56
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,275
- Oh, yeah. Right. Sure he will.
- Fair share, Gavin?

57
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,998
You're the only one making money here!

58
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,469
No, you and your whores.

59
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,715
Now, Ben, that ain't fair.

60
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,496
You know that.
You were there the other night.

61
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,873
You know that's a lie now, Gavin!

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,281
- Please, brothers and sisters...
- You know that's a lie.

63
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,078
- Please, brothers and sisters.
- Reason?

64
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,595
Ask the Dennehys
how far reasoning got them.

65
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,736
He burned all the Dennehys' crops!

66
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,352
- Our farms are rotting.
- That's right.

67
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,736
It's only a matter of time
before he drives all of us out of here.

68
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,876
For the sake of our children,

69
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,794
I believe it's time we leave Rose Creek.

70
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,336
- To where?
- And where are we gonna go?

71
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,336
- I know you're scared.
- I've given everything I have.

72
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,193
We all are, but we came far to get here.

73
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,794
Suffered losses too painful to bear
to make this our home.

74
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,154
- Praise God.
- Amen.

75
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
We did it.

76
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,029
All of us.

77
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,748
Together.

78
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,075
This valley is ours.

79
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,880
- I agree with Matthew.
- I'm with Matthew.

80
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,279
This is the Lord's house.
It's no place for guns.

81
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,277
There are women and children.

82
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,798
Shh.

83
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,239
Oh!

84
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,514
Mr. Bogue.

85
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,911
This is what you love, what you'd die for.

86
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,033
And what your children

87
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,318
and your children's children
will work on, suffer for,

88
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,510
be consumed by.

89
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,997
Look at me, boy. Come on up here.

90
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,711
Come on, boy. Come on!

91
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,477
It's okay, son.

92
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,397
Now, I come here for gold.

93
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,639
Gold.

94
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,874
This country has long equated democracy
with capitalism,

95
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,551
capitalism with God.

96
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,279
So you're standing not only in
the way of progress and capital.

97
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,351
You're standing in the way of God!

98
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,154
- And for what? Hmm?
- No, preacher.

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,069
You want to help me out?

100
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,318
Let's find out.

101
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,237
Put your hand in there for me.

102
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,075
Go on.

103
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Go on.

104
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,478
Land.

105
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,198
This is no longer land.

106
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,793
The moment I put a pin in the map,

107
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,189
the day I descended
into this godforsaken valley

108
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,679
and cast my gaze upon it,

109
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,877
it ceased to be land and became...

110
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,480
That's it. Pull your hand out.

111
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,913
Dust.

112
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,948
Go on, sit back down.

113
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,232
This is your God?

114
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,234
$20 for each parcel of dust,
that is my offer.

115
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,056
- My land is worth three times that!
- You can't do that.

116
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,116
We have to think of our families.

117
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,376
This valley's worth more than that.

118
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,296
- You're stealing our land!
- And our livelihood.

119
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,799
It won't sweeten.

120
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,232
It'll only sour.

121
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,936
- They're coming in!
- Everybody on out!

122
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,188
Get out of here! Go on!

123
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,157
What are you doing? This is God's house.

124
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,751
Both of you! Stay here!

125
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,752
You're not going anywhere. Stay here!

126
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,558
No, no, no!

127
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,477
- No, please, no!
- Get down.

128
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,391
Somebody help her. Come on. Come on.

129
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,078
- Get out!
- It's the Lord's house!

130
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,277
- Move!
- Get the hell out of here!

131
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,592
No! Don't!

132
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,474
Please!

133
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,194
Do not turn your back on the Lord.

134
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,751
Please stop.

135
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,576
- Please, stop it!
- Leave him alone!

136
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,736
Stay down, preacher!

137
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,036
- I'll return to Rose Creek in three weeks.
- Stop moving.

138
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,190
Those of you who accept my offer,

139
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,840
whose signed deeds are on my desk
when I return...

140
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,837
- Matthew!
- ...shall get their $20.

141
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Get off him!

142
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,792
Those of you who do not,

143
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,236
may your good Lord help you.

144
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,599
I'll help you. I'm sorry. Let me help you.

145
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,159
The Lord's watching.

146
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
What kind of man are you?

147
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,709
What'd these people ever do to you? Huh?

148
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,552
For what, Bogue?

149
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,514
For land?

150
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,708
For land?

151
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,515
No!

152
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,831
Matthew!

153
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,235
Isabel, no!

154
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,598
Son of a bitch.

155
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,790
- No, Caleb!
- Oh, my God.

156
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,836
Down, down! Stay down.

157
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,713
No, no.

158
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,709
No!

159
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,791
Leave the bodies where they lay

160
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,320
and let 'em look at 'em a few days.

161
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,277
No!

162
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,271
- My God.
- No!

163
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,110
No! No!

164
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,198
Caleb.

165
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,191
Please, God, don't take him.

166
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,096
Come on, Leni. We have to
get the baby away from the church.

167
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,856
- It's on fire. Come on, come on, come on.
- No, no.

168
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,269
Come on, come with us. Come on, Leni.

169
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,277
This is the Lord's house.

170
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,616
- Come on, there's a fire!
- Something's on fire!

171
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,518
- Let's put it out, men. We can't leave this!
- Shit, it's on fire!

172
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,096
It'll be burned to the ground
if we don't hurry!

173
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,473
- Stay back!
- Wait, wait, wait.

174
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,993
- Stay back.
- Stay back, men!

175
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,376
Come on, we're just trying to help.

176
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,914
You don't get paid to help. Move!

177
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,433
- I can't.
- I'm fine.

178
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,551
Come on. Come on. Come with us.

179
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,839
Damn wheel's busted. I can't fix it!

180
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,359
Got a long ride ahead of us.

181
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,349
Well, lookee there.

182
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,797
You know where you are, cowboy?

183
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,397
Oh, get right here. Get right here.

184
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,591
Yeah, I'm hoping to change my luck.

185
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,069
- These cards are shit.
- Deal.

186
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,598
Now, let's try to keep
civil this round, okay?

187
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,199
I'm looking at you, Lucas.

188
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,033
Just play the damn game, Faraday.

189
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,440
What the hell is he doing here?

190
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,914
Shot of busthead.

191
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,837
Sorry, don't carry that kind, cowboy.

192
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,030
Well, in that case, I'll have a double.

193
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,960
- What's that for?
- Information.

194
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,271
Looking for a man. Big fella.

195
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,634
'Bout your size.

196
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,200
What's his name?

197
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,312
Name his mama gave him
was, uh, Daniel Harrison,

198
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,034
but sometimes
he goes by the name of Powder Dan.

199
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,874
Killed a tenant farmer
and his son in cold blood.

200
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,393
Stole the man's plow horse.

201
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,075
Man's wife tried to intervene.
Took advantage, then killed her, too.

202
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,518
- Ain't heard of him.
- Well, like I said, he use different names.

203
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,428
Had a bullet scar on his,
uh, left shoulder.

204
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,948
Right there.

205
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,432
Now, Powder Dan ran with an outlaw,
name of July Bully.

206
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,794
May he rest in peace.

207
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,958
- He's dead?
- Yes, sir.

208
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,040
How'd he die?

209
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,360
I whispered in his ear.

210
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,955
Yeah, what's that?

211
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,795
Come here.

212
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,551
Bring them in

213
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,959
Bring them in

214
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,474
From the fields of sin

215
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,513
Bring them in

216
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,512
He shot my damn foot!

217
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,189
Come on, hey. Settle down, mister. Come on.

218
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,471
Come on, easy.

219
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,709
I got a family, mister.

220
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,631
They're better off without you.

221
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,151
Somebody fetch the sheriff.

222
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,576
- Get the sheriff!
- Get the sheriff.

223
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,716
- Get the sheriff!
- Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

224
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,832
I'm gonna kill you, Faraday.

225
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,229
You son of a bitch. Deal with you later.

226
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,680
- Well, I know it.
- Go on out.

227
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,715
Come on, come on.

228
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,112
Dan, you dead?

229
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,872
Pity. I had just ordered a drink from him.

230
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,550
Money for blood's a peculiar business.

231
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,600
He started shooting
everyone in cold blood!

232
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,656
- And he's still in there, yeah.
- That son of a bitch!

233
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,874
- There he is!
- There he is!

234
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,234
- That's him!
- That's him!

235
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,896
- Sheriff! Sheriff!
- He shot him in cold blood!

236
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,478
My name is Sam Chisolm.

237
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,712
I'm a duly sworn warrant officer
of the circuit court in Wichita, Kansas.

238
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,518
I'm also a licensed peace officer

239
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,309
in the Indian Territories, Arkansas,
Nebraska, and seven other states.

240
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,189
Now, this man is wanted on charges
in Nebraska,

241
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,872
expedited by federal writ,

242
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,750
under Common State Law Enforcement Act.

243
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,753
Yes, sir.

244
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,070
Wire Judge Talbot in
Wichita for the reward.

245
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,798
Half the money goes to the man's widow.

246
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,474
And you can hold my part for me
till I get back.

247
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,560
Where you headed?

248
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,317
Off into the mountains, hunting a vaquero.

249
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,832
No, Miss Emma. I'll do it.

250
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,436
- Excuse me. Are you a bounty hunter, sir?
- No, sir.

251
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,696
Yeah, that's Powder Dan.
Get him on outta here.

252
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,915
I have need of a man with
your qualifications.

253
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,274
You can't afford me.

254
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,193
Well, can you at least describe the rates
or offer up the particulars?

255
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,430
Rose Creek.
It's only four days' ride from here.

256
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,637
A rich man has overtaken the town.
He's killed half a dozen men.

257
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,679
He's got the sheriff on his payroll
and Blackstone agents in his employ.

258
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,399
Well, you don't need a bounty hunter,
you need an army.

259
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,317
And we intend to hire one, sir.

260
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,236
Guess you weren't expecting
to see me again, were ya?

261
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,277
Wild Bill? Is that you? You look like shit.

262
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,078
Ain't no Wild Bill.

263
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,073
They call me

264
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,718
the Two Gun Kid.

265
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,936
Keep your hands away
from your weapons, Faraday.

266
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,554
- Hands up. Hands up.
- Hands away from the...

267
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,273
Get his guns, Dicky.

268
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,199
Don't try nothing.

269
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,750
Oh, a pretty one.

270
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,676
What's that, a Peacemaker?

271
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,318
Now turn around.

272
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,233
I'm not for sale.

273
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,476
Mister. Mister!

274
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,032
You intend to make me chase?

275
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,279
I have a proposition.

276
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,113
- And I'm wary of propositions, miss.
- Missus.

277
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,239
I'm not sure if my friend
filled you in on the details.

278
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,389
Enough of 'em.

279
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,830
Then why won't you at least listen?

280
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,115
We're simple farmers.

281
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,636
Decent, hard-working people
being driven from our homes.

282
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,597
Men slaughtered in cold blood.

283
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,193
Women and children
without food or essentials.

284
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,114
All because some man named Bogue wants
to mine our valley and take it from us.

285
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,429
Bartholomew Bogue?

286
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,589
You know of him?

287
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,233
Heard the name.

288
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,958
What's this?

289
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,998
Everything we have.

290
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,632
That's what it's worth to us.

291
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,515
Been offered a lot for my work
but never everything.

292
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,190
That man murdered my husband.

293
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,870
Killed him dead in the
middle of the street.

294
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,514
So you seek revenge.

295
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,355
I seek righteousness, as should we all.

296
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,711
But I'll take revenge.

297
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,318
The Two Gun Kid.

298
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,038
That's my name now.

299
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,348
'Cause you got two guns?

300
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,396
- Maybe not.
- Told you it was a stupid name.

301
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,277
Dicky, shut your goddamn mouth.

302
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,759
Faraday, walk!

303
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,195
Just mad 'cause Mama gave him
the name Earl.

304
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,880
What do you want to do with him?

305
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,354
How 'bout we take him over
into that mine there?

306
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,598
- Uh...
- Whoa.

307
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,591
This is as good a place as any.

308
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,749
Into the mine, Faraday.

309
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,200
If you're gonna kill me, kill me.

310
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,759
If you're gonna rob me, rob me.

311
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,711
But I will not go in that mine.

312
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,873
There's rats in there.

313
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,794
Virginia City? Three days past?

314
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,632
Best you remember who'd you cheat
out of $50 in a card game!

315
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,110
I assure you I did not have to cheat
to beat the likes of you two.

316
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
Easy.

317
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,719
Gentlemen, allow me a moment
to show you something quite miraculous.

318
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,309
You just show us our money, Faraday!

319
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,549
Fifty-two cards.

320
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,108
- Pick a card.
- We ain't playing no game.

321
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,794
You've got the drop on me.
You'll get a hoot outta this.

322
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,616
Come on, Earl,
just pick one real quick.

323
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,517
You know how I like magic.

324
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,634
- All right, keep the gun on him.
- Got it trained right on him.

325
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,399
No tricks now.

326
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,954
Don't let me see it.

327
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,600
Show your associate.
Commit the card to memory.

328
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,109
When you're ready,
put the card back in the deck.

329
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,359
Don't try nothing.

330
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,640
Keep your gun on me.
That's very good, Earl.

331
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,836
Now, there's no way
I can know what your card is

332
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,239
because I didn't see it.

333
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,030
- Yet...
- Come on. Let's go!

334
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,755
With a shuffle and a cut, miraculously,

335
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,874
your card.

336
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,554
That ain't his card.
Man, you ain't no magic man.

337
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,675
That's not it? Hold on.

338
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,513
Quit playing around
before I blow your goddamn head off.

339
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,115
Oh, remember the plan, Earl.
I get to kill him.

340
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,239
You didn't let me finish.

341
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,673
Your card was the king of hearts, right?

342
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,352
Is this your card?

343
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,192
Now, you see? That was worth it, wasn't it?

344
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,696
- That was kind of good.
- Pretty good.

345
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,869
That was...

346
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,588
No, you just killed my brother. Huh?

347
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,035
- Should I kill you?
- No. Please.

348
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,350
Would you like to see another magic trick?

349
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,028
No.

350
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
Yeah.

351
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,719
It's called The Incredible...

352
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,153
No.

353
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,637
Disappearing...

354
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,195
Ear.

355
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,360
Oh, my ear!

356
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,077
We are never gonna cross paths again.

357
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,040
Please don't kill me.

358
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,159
Keep your money, please.

359
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,234
I didn't want to kill him.

360
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,917
He shouldn't have touched my guns.

361
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,392
The only way in is the valley floor,

362
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,438
and the main road in and
out is to the west.

363
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,919
Where's the mine?

364
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,629
Here.

365
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,790
- And where's Bogue?
- Sacramento.

366
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,711
Back in less than three weeks.

367
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,230
And how many men you say
you got left in town?

368
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,469
Forty, maybe.

369
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,634
Farmers. Not fighters.

370
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,856
You understand what it means
when you start something like this?

371
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,235
We did not start this, Mr. Chisolm.

372
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,398
Whoa!

373
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,433
What are you waiting on?
Just get him under control.

374
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,516
Spend all night at the saloon,
and then you can't even control a silly horse.

375
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,431
Come on, lad, get in there!

376
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,317
Silly horse? That's a stallion.

377
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,312
His name's Jack, and he's killed men before,
so he oughta be careful.

378
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,630
- Easy, easy, easy!
- I require my horse back.

379
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
That horse.

380
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,551
Two days past.

381
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,995
Your horse against my Irish whiskey.

382
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,150
Behind the saloon rolling dice.

383
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,358
That, sir, is a lie.
A complete, absolute...

384
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,868
Good Lord.

385
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,416
- Easy.
- I thought that was a dream.

386
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,715
I thought you were a leprechaun.
That was real?

387
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,429
Uh, I was mistaken.
I would like to buy my horse back.

388
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,273
Though I am light of funds at the moment.

389
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,714
So...

390
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,516
Seems we have ourselves
a Mexican standoff,

391
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,070
only between an Irishman and a Baptist,
and I'm not sure how that ends.

392
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,469
With you walking away

393
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,599
without your horse.

394
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,188
Now, why'd you have to go
and touch your gun for?

395
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,674
We were in the middle
of a gentlemen's negotiation.

396
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,875
Come on!

397
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,456
How much for his horse?

398
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,352
$25 for the horse.

399
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,237
Seven and two bits for the saddle.

400
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,197
Our paths cross again.

401
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,399
To what do I owe the pleasure?

402
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,754
Come on.

403
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,990
Took a job. Looking for
some men to join me.

404
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,229
Is there money in it?

405
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,589
And who's she?

406
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,269
Joan of Arc.

407
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,593
My name's Emma Cullen.

408
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,389
And this is my associate, Teddy Q.

409
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,550
Well, I do have an
affinity for shiny things.

410
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,315
- Is it difficult?
- Impossible.

411
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,949
- How many you got so far?
- Two.

412
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,429
- What, them?
- You and me.

413
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,151
Sending a woman to gather guns
is not very chivalrous.

414
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,312
I volunteered.

415
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,758
Insisted, actually.

416
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,236
Lot of fire in that one.

417
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,833
Begs the question.

418
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,556
Whose execution do we seek?

419
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,112
Bartholomew Bogue.

420
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,431
Bart Bogue? The robber baron?

421
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,896
Means there's gold in the equation,

422
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,936
but gold don't do you much good
when you're buried with it.

423
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,640
You want out, feel free to leave.

424
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,869
Just leave my horse.

425
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,068
'Cause I paid for it.

426
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,235
Just speaking out loud.

427
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,034
Twenty miles east of here.
Volcano Springs. Supply station.

428
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,192
You look for a Cajun, name of Robicheaux.

429
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,271
- Goodnight Robicheaux?
- That's right.

430
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,360
The Angel of Death.

431
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,590
Meet me outside of Junction City
in three days.

432
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,961
Yeah, I ain't there,
then it means I'm dead and you can...

433
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,515
You can keep my horse.

434
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,918
You're with me. Come on, let's go.
Come on. Hyah!

435
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,354
Three days.

436
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,232
The gun. The gun!

437
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,192
Give it to him.

438
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,198
He was already dead,
if that's what you're wondering.

439
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,114
- You been sleeping in here?
- He doesn't snore much.

440
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,515
- You Vasquez?
- What's this to you?

441
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,239
Here. I'm gonna tear up a warrant.

442
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,440
I just want to make sure
I'm talking to the right man.

443
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,829
- No.
- Shh, shh.

444
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,392
Poor likeness.

445
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,549
You a bounty hunter?

446
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,278
Duly sworn warrant officer.

447
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,589
Where is your gun?

448
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,671
Man carries a gun, he tends to use it.

449
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,310
Dead ranger by your hand. $500 reward.

450
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,674
Maybe he had it coming.

451
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,016
Doesn't matter to me either way.

452
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,635
- Why? You intend to get that reward?
- That depends.

453
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,598
Got a business proposition for you.

454
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,994
Well, does this business involve her?

455
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,998
- Yes, it does.
- Ooh.

456
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,594
- Get me out of here! Let me out of here!
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

457
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,110
You wipe that smile off your face.

458
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,230
Oh, laugh now. Get it outta your system.

459
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,514
After our business is concluded, what then?

460
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,511
There'll still be a lot
of men after your hide.

461
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,477
- And that should give me comfort?
- Should.

462
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,599
I won't be one of 'em.

463
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,113
You're loco, my friend.

464
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,640
Si.

465
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,196
Hyah! Hyah!

466
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,718
Hyah!

467
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,279
Let me tell you the game.

468
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,194
- Go on, now!
- Fastest gun wins.

469
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,388
Winner take all.

470
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,110
Hope you've all put your bets down.

471
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,994
Arcade.

472
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,279
Billy Rocks.

473
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,352
On my gun.

474
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,238
Whoo!

475
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,440
Yeah, how about that, boys?

476
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,160
- That's good.
- That was pretty good, huh?

477
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,351
- Billy wins.
- What?

478
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,556
Are you blind? Come on, Eddy.

479
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,589
- You're a liar!
- Oh, come on, Arcade.

480
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,956
- Hey, come on, we all saw me win, now.
- Yeah!

481
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,216
- Double down!
- We all want some more!

482
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,360
Why don't we do it for real?

483
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,616
- Come on, Arcade, back off.
- No, no, double down.

484
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,234
Come on, you scum-sucking runt of a man.

485
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,436
I want no part of this.

486
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,796
- Double or nothing!
- It's your funeral, Arcade.

487
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,838
Double or nothing.

488
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,554
He called it.

489
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,038
Whoa!

490
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,559
All right.

491
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,073
He's lost his mind.

492
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,800
- He ain't got a chance.
- It ain't right.

493
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,080
Billy?

494
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,149
On my gun.

495
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,552
- Oh!
- Sh...

496
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,016
- Never seen anything like this.
- What the hell was that?

497
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,837
- Oh, come on, now.
- I think he killed him.

498
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,296
- He killed him, right?
- What the hell?

499
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,356
Damn!

500
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,240
Damn it, Arcade.

501
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,918
- Man, he got it.
- What was that?

502
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,072
- Damn!
- See? I told you. I told you!

503
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,868
I ain't in the habit of
paying off cheaters.

504
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,598
I'll be keeping my money.

505
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,439
Easy, Goodnight. He's drunk.

506
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,678
He don't mean it.

507
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,955
Mr. Robicheaux,
if I'd known it was you, that was your man,

508
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
I never would've made
such a disrespectful comment.

509
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,552
It's all right, son.
You just pay me double.

510
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,119
Yes, sir.

511
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,470
- Damn fool.
- Goodnight Robicheaux?

512
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,957
Sam Chisolm sent us.

513
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,518
- All right, get him outta here.
- That's gotta be real rough.

514
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,480
I said,
what do you think I'm paying for?

515
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,877
"Duly sworn warrant officer

516
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,474
"from Wichita, Kansas,
and seven other states."

517
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,196
- Do we have the same man?
- Yeah, believe we do.

518
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,396
Should we talk somewhere more private?

519
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,590
Nah, I like it right here.
Billy, you like it here?

520
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,511
Oh, yeah.

521
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,596
- How'd y'all meet?
- Ooh, how did we meet, Billy?

522
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,070
I was serving a warrant on him
for the Northern Pacific Railroad.

523
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,270
Warrant for what?
Killing a man with a hairpin?

524
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,436
Now, now,
you're gonna have to pay for that.

525
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,949
That is funny.

526
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,837
Here's what it is.

527
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,708
I found Billy
down in an old redneck saloon in Texas,

528
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,856
and all these good ol' boys,

529
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,474
they didn't want to serve
Billy's kind, all right?

530
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:10,071
So this, uh, petite son of a bitch
took on the whole room bare-knuckled.

531
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,197
I watched in awe, and I said to myself,

532
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,193
"Goodnight, this is not a man to arrest,
this is a man to befriend."

533
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,314
- You make your living off of his alley fights?
- Equal shares.

534
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,717
Between fights, Goody helps me
navigate the white man's prejudices.

535
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,835
Mmm-hmm.

536
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,152
I keep him employed,
and he keeps me on the level.

537
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,880
Well, Mr. Chisolm told
us to come fetch you,

538
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,136
but he didn't say anything
about your friend over there.

539
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,230
Wherever I go, Billy goes.

540
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,035
Yes, sir.

541
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
We understand each other.

542
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,628
Well, day-and-a-half ride
to Junction City. We got two days.

543
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,915
Let's do a half day of drinking.

544
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,757
I like you.

545
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,912
Ha-ha-ha!

546
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,560
- Sam Chisolm!
- Goodnight Robicheaux.

547
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,513
Oh, sight to see,
even with a storm on our backs.

548
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,073
Yeah. Rain ain't nothing but wet.

549
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,754
Well, what we lose in the fire
we will find in the ashes.

550
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,910
That's right.

551
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Oh, yeah.

552
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,351
- Ah...
- This is Billy Rocks. He's with me.

553
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,670
Sam, uh, that's Billy.

554
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,399
He come with Goodnight.

555
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,440
I don't know about this one.

556
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
Who's this?

557
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,632
- We work for her.
- Uh-huh.

558
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,198
Well, enchanté, mon cher.

559
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,234
- Emma Cullen.
- Your hands are cold, Emma.

560
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,673
Are you nervous?

561
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,958
Don't be.

562
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,268
Goodnight's my name.

563
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,113
That Billy is pretty nifty
with them pigstickers.

564
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,398
Oh, good, we got a Mexican.

565
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,952
Oh... yippee, yippee, yippee, ándale.

566
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,791
Oh? Ooh, oh...

567
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,199
Olé, muchacho.

568
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,953
What a merry band we are.

569
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,197
Me a gray, Chisolm a blue,

570
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,510
Billy, a mysterious man of the Orient,

571
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,148
a drunk Irishman,

572
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,151
a Texican,

573
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,470
a female and her gentleman caller.

574
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,950
This is not going to end well.

575
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,557
I'm Mexican, cabrón.

576
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,148
No such thing as a "Texican."

577
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,231
Try telling that to my granddaddy.

578
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,871
He died at the Alamo.

579
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,157
New Orleans Greys, long barracks, bayonets.

580
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,390
Blood. Teeth.

581
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,313
Mauled by a horde of teeming brown devils.

582
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,677
My grandfather was one of those devils,
you know.

583
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,352
Toluca Battalion.

584
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,510
Hey. Maybe my grandfather
killed your grandfather, huh?

585
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,431
Mmm, what a charming thought.

586
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,470
I sense we are bonding.

587
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,911
So we're talking about the same Jack Horne.

588
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,195
The Jack Horne. The legend Jack Horne.

589
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,350
Legend? Legend, my ass.

590
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,317
Yeah, he might've killed 300 Crow,

591
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,391
but he ain't never met
the Pigeon brothers before.

592
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,556
And you saying that's Jack Horne's rifle?

593
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,190
- It was Jack Horne's rifle.
- Uh-huh.

594
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,952
And there's an Army fort
want to pay $1,000 for proof of death.

595
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,269
Rifle'll do.

596
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
You have no body?

597
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,354
Well, you see, Len here
smashed a boulder over his head.

598
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,200
Fell off a cliff.

599
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,192
Snuck up on him, huh?

600
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,635
Just what the hell
are you trying to imply?

601
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,115
Oh, my Lord.

602
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,040
Mmm.

603
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,549
The Pigeon brothers
weren't famous very long.

604
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,235
These two ungodly creatures

605
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,272
broke a rock on my head.

606
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,598
Robbed me of my possessions.

607
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,432
I trailed 'em for two days.

608
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,875
Guess they got
what they deserved, Mr. Horne. Uh...

609
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,999
My name is Sam Chisolm.

610
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,277
We met about six years ago up in Cheyenne.

611
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,238
Now, I got a right,

612
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,996
by the Lord and by the law,
to take back what belongs to me.

613
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,239
Are we in agreement?

614
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,200
Yeah.

615
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,200
Yes, sir.

616
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,879
You still collecting scalps?

617
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,117
The government don't pay
a bounty on redskins anymore.

618
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,553
You must be out of work.

619
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,840
Now, that's part of
another story, ain't it?

620
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,719
Yes, it is.

621
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,639
We, uh... We're looking
for some men, Mr. Horne,

622
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,228
some good men like yourself, to do a job.

623
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,993
Going after a fella,
name of Bartholomew Bogue and his men.

624
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,595
Just... Well, just thought
you'd be interested.

625
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,036
I believe that bear
was wearing people's clothes.

626
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,309
Never trust a people
who bury their dead above the ground.

627
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,432
Don't call the alligator
"big mouth" till you cross the river.

628
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,736
- Are you in the army?
- No, sir.

629
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,788
I figured 'cause you carry this
army-issue Open Top.45 Long Colt.

630
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,518
Took you for a soldier.

631
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,440
You know how to shoot that thing?

632
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,069
- If I had to, I reckon.
- If you had to?

633
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:40,113
Tell you what, for a sip of your whiskey,
I'll teach you a few lessons.

634
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,993
Lesson one.

635
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,995
This

636
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,553
means don't shoot.

637
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,313
You got it?

638
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,992
Now watch this one.

639
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,040
Now, lesson two.

640
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,358
Take this card out of my hand.

641
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,715
You take the card, you live.

642
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,392
You don't, you die.

643
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,591
Come on, Teddy.

644
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,993
Focus.

645
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,118
You got to be quick.

646
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,676
You just lost your first gunfight.

647
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,878
Try it again.

648
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,599
Lesson two. It was never about the cards.

649
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,316
Now, I'll give you a third lesson.

650
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,789
Think you need that more than I do.

651
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,670
Why don't you just take the rest,
Mr. Faraday?

652
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,079
Well, I think I will.

653
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,038
Oh.

654
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,156
The fire still burns.

655
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,509
We have heard the chimes at midnight.
Have we not?

656
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,830
So what's the play here, Sam, huh?

657
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,475
What's the payout?

658
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,872
Little gold, hmm?

659
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,871
Cash money, hmm?

660
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,960
Diamonds?

661
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,560
You ain't changed.

662
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,352
Everything that, uh...

663
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,035
Everything they have,
that's what they offered.

664
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,838
Everything? Yes?

665
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,712
She's about the same age
your sister'd be by now, huh?

666
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,153
Yeah, she is.

667
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,515
Just making sure we're fighting
the battle in front of us, not behind.

668
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,039
Smell that?

669
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,792
What smell?

670
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,600
- The smoke?
- It's blood.

671
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,719
- He's been tracking us.
- I'll be damned.

672
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,234
Please tell me I'm hallucinating.

673
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,471
You are hallucinating.

674
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,039
So am I.

675
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,360
Where there's one,
there's more.

676
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,040
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

677
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,916
Comanche?

678
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,069
We come in peace.

679
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,200
Vasquez.

680
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,352
You speak Comanche?

681
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,998
Some.

682
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,513
You speak...

683
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,074
...white man's English?

684
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,840
Some.

685
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,948
Where's your tribe? Huh?

686
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:09,318
The elders told me my path is different.

687
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,915
My path is different, too.
My path... Our path.

688
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,151
We go to fight wicked men.

689
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,399
Probably, we all die.

690
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,677
I'm called Red Harvest.

691
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,596
- What'd he say?
- Said he's with us.

692
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,196
Gonna fix him some breakfast. I had mine.

693
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,313
Let's get this fire started.

694
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,157
- Mr. Paley, come on in.
- All right, sweetheart.

695
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,958
Buy me a drink, sugar.

696
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,272
Better get her all nailed down.

697
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,240
I keep telling him.
He just don't listen.

698
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,479
Kristen.

699
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,200
Hyah. Come on!

700
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,513
That man's trouble.

701
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,993
Afternoon, gentlemen.

702
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,310
Town's got a ban on firearms.

703
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,795
Check 'em in. Get 'em back on your way out.

704
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,031
You don't mind me asking,
but how is it all of you go so well-heeled?

705
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,552
These men are deputies.

706
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,755
Awful lot of deputies
for such a small place, ain't it?

707
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,240
What's his story?

708
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,876
Ah. My, uh, manservant. He's harmless.

709
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,116
Saved his life in Shanghai,

710
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,478
debt of honor and the like.

711
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,757
Now, you don't mind
giving up those guns, do you?

712
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,308
Absolutely. Law and order, I say.

713
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,920
Sheriff?

714
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,840
Now, I must tell you that
I'm more than happy to cooperate.

715
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,673
I can't say the same thing
for my compadres behind you.

716
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,356
Quite a batch of strays.

717
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,952
I'll say a prayer for you.
You know, a little prayer.

718
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,556
Yeah, you'll make a hell of a rug.

719
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,319
And you'll be murdered

720
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,993
by the world's greatest lover.

721
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,678
All right.

722
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,832
All right.

723
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,799
What's your aim here, mister?

724
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,473
Well...

725
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,912
I hear that there are some cowards
running security here,

726
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,992
so I figured we'd come down here
and look after all this gold.

727
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,274
Cowards?

728
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,312
Blackstone detective agents. Cowards.

729
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,157
Now, Blackstones are good, union busting,

730
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,955
back-shooting homesteaders
and women, but

731
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,576
you put 'em up against some real men,
men that know what they're doing...

732
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,192
You sure you don't want my gun?

733
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,116
Now, you do know who we work for, right?

734
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,193
The force he can bring to bear?

735
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,873
You tell Bogue

736
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,872
if he wants his town,

737
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,513
come see me.

738
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,554
I don't believe he heard you.

739
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:04,960
Meh-koo!

740
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,111
Go on, horse.

741
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,949
No!

742
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,871
Devil, don't shoot. I'm the proprietor.

743
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,076
No!

744
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,795
Lord, give me clear vision!

745
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,314
Clear sight!

746
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,912
Hyah!

747
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,393
Hyah! Hyah!

748
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,640
Hyah!

749
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,240
Hyah! Hyah!

750
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,793
Go on, shoot him.

751
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,793
Take the shot.

752
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,353
Take that shot.

753
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,792
Take the damn shot!

754
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,233
Give me that.

755
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,715
It's jammed.

756
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,079
How'd we do?

757
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,759
I got five.

758
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,632
- I got six.
- Hey.

759
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,191
- What'd you get?
- Six.

760
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,272
I got seven.

761
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,680
You wanna try and tie it up?

762
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,312
Huh, chingado?

763
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,717
Say when, güero.

764
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,400
Hey.

765
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,229
Come on out of there.

766
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,551
Come on. Come on!

767
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,793
Take off that gun belt.

768
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,194
You all right?

769
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,952
Nice and easy.

770
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,839
Take off that badge, too.

771
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,228
I'm still sheriff. Duly elected.

772
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,231
Consider this a recall.

773
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,958
Now, you're gonna deliver
a message to your boss.

774
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,712
Mister, you already sent him a message,

775
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,320
only you're not gonna like his answer.

776
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,830
Tell him we have his town,
we have his whole valley.

777
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,354
He want it back,
he's gonna have to make a deal with us.

778
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,238
He don't make deals.
You can ask anybody here.

779
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,517
He's just gonna send as many men
as it takes to squash you flat.

780
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,680
We'll be waiting.
In the meantime, you tell him this.

781
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,669
Lincoln. Like the president. Say it.

782
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,432
Lincoln, like the president.

783
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,556
That's right. Lincoln, Kansas.

784
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,416
And you tell him if he
don't show up himself,

785
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:41,318
he ain't nothing
but a yellow-bellied sapsucking coward.

786
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,600
Go on, git.

787
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,028
Git.

788
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,314
Hey.

789
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,039
Sam Chisolm. Say it.

790
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,111
Sam Chisolm.

791
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,712
Yes, sir.

792
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,796
Well, this is quite the welcome party.

793
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,758
- Where is everybody?
- I think we killed 'em all.

794
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,314
No, they're here.

795
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:19,154
They just want to make sure their candle
is lit before they blow out the match.

796
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:30,915
Everyone! Come on! Come out!

797
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,072
- Come out!
- Come on out, everybody!

798
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,552
What's the matter with y'all?

799
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,312
Don't you see what they just did?

800
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,636
Come on! Come out!

801
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,916
These men are here to help us!

802
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,152
- Come on!
- Well, look at that.

803
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,840
- Come on!
- Nothing to be scared of! Let's go!

804
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,195
- Come on!
- Is he dead?

805
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,952
Come on. Get away.

806
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,235
It's okay.

807
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,155
Come on, don't be afraid.

808
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:19,358
I have assembled these men
and offered fair pay.

809
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,074
Who picked you to deal on our behalf?

810
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,197
Seems I was the only one
with balls enough to do so.

811
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,754
So I did.

812
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,999
As I said, these men are here to help us.

813
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,760
Mr. Chisolm?

814
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,670
Uh, my name is Sam Chisolm,

815
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,878
and, uh, I'm a duly sworn warrant officer
in Wichita, Kansas.

816
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,995
Uh, also, a licensed peace officer

817
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,833
in the Indian Territories, Arkansas
and seven other states.

818
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,559
Now, what happened here was

819
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,752
just an opening skirmish.

820
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,432
The real battle is yet to come.

821
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:07,035
The idea is that when it comes,
it'll be on our terms.

822
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,953
- On our terms?
- Yeah, there's no way in hell.

823
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,713
Son of a bitch'll come back with 200 men
and slaughter us all.

824
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,792
If you want to leave, leave.

825
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,435
Just don't take anything
you didn't bring with you.

826
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,400
You want to keep your town,
you're gonna have to fight for it.

827
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,279
Now, we're here to help you,
but you got to help us.

828
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,238
We're gonna need every somebody out here
to help us fight.

829
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,756
Good Lord! Are you suggesting we wait here
to face retaliation?

830
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:33,955
- Hell, yeah, he is.
- What?

831
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:37,237
- Let 'em come. We'll be ready for 'em.
- I beg pardon, sir.

832
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,072
The spirit here is willing,

833
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,196
- but we are not killers.
- That's right.

834
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,590
Most aren't, till they're looking
down the barrel of a gun.

835
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,151
Now, I never shot anything
that could shoot back at me.

836
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,874
But this is our home.

837
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,256
- Damned if I won't defend it.
- That's right.

838
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:54,256
And now let me tell you,
these men that are coming here,

839
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,633
they're gonna underestimate you.

840
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:56,960
That'll be their first mistake.

841
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,595
That's all well and good,
but we don't have enough time.

842
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,760
Bogue said he'd be back in three weeks,
that was eight days ago.

843
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,195
- One week.
- That only leaves us... No, one week?

844
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,952
- One week?
- One week.

845
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,156
Three days' ride to Sacramento
with the bad news,

846
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,470
one day for Bogue to plan, three days back.

847
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,039
Seven days, that's all you got.

848
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,839
For goodness' sake.

849
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,713
We'll get started in the morning.
Get a good night's rest.

850
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,031
May be your last for a while.

851
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,392
I'll have some more beans.

852
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,590
Like being in one of them damn zoos.

853
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,717
Fame is a sarcophagus.

854
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,640
You read those in a book,
or you just make 'em up as you go?

855
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,349
I'll try to use
one-syllable words from now on.

856
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,631
What... What's a syllable?

857
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,198
White people's food...

858
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,713
...is for dogs.

859
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,949
What'd he say?

860
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:37,557
He asked that you kindly stop
staring at his hairline.

861
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,874
I will.

862
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,520
As long as he stops
licking his lips over mine, hmm?

863
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,720
Ah...

864
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,875
These bodies don't get buried
in the church graveyard.

865
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,473
You take 'em to Boot Hill.

866
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,120
I expect
we'll make ten miles by sundown.

867
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,590
I suppose that undertaker's
gonna get some business out of this deal.

868
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:08,229
I guarantee you, there ain't
no reason to be running off scared.

869
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,914
Hate to see y'all go like this, now.

870
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,155
Now, now, won't you reconsider?

871
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,200
Hyah!

872
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,795
Who'd have thought
we'd travel this many miles

873
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:32,749
just to have the good people of Rose Creek
turn tail and leave us to die?

874
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:36,675
Well, some people have died for much less.

875
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:47,039
Behold.

876
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,193
Our army approaches.

877
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:58,870
Oh, good, they brought their pitchforks.
We may stand a chance after all.

878
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,876
Lord, keep me from judgment.

879
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,874
Gun on your shoulder.
Right shoulder.

880
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,074
Knives. There's nothing to it.

881
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,677
Oh, boy.

882
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,233
Who here fought
in the War of Northern Aggression?

883
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:30,955
Mmm. Not me.

884
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,473
What is this? Come on.

885
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,993
Throw.

886
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,593
Slash.

887
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,117
Stab. That's it.

888
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,160
Yah!

889
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:46,720
Yah!

890
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,713
That simple.

891
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,631
- Like hell.
- Hey.

892
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,553
- How the hell we gonna learn to do that?
- Get back here!

893
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,834
Get back!

894
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,353
Fire!

895
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,750
Jesus wept!

896
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:11,988
Reload!

897
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,275
Statistically speaking,
they should've hit something.

898
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,112
Y'all starting to piss me off.

899
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,397
How many times I got to tell you
to keep your foot up underneath you, huh?

900
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,278
Come on, now.
Schoolteacher, take your hat off your head.

901
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,480
Jesus!

902
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:24,955
Teddy...

903
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,948
Expect more from you, son.

904
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,200
The recoil is not to be shunned,
it's to be absorbed.

905
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,510
I ain't shunning a damn thing, sir.

906
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,873
You trying to make me angry?
Is that what it is?

907
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,393
- Do you...
- Oh!

908
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,917
That's the second time for you.

909
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,720
- Go make me some eggs.
- The damn hammer...

910
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,234
No, I don't wanna hear it!
Have a nice afternoon.

911
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,016
You gonna point...
You gonna point that rifle at me?

912
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,155
No, sir.

913
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,678
You cut the ears off a mule,
don't make him a horse.

914
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:53,760
Leave your weapon.

915
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,536
I'm trying to help you.
You understand?

916
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:58,074
Keep the target soft,
pull the trigger slow.

917
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:01,118
- So slow. You can't pull it slow enough.
- Like that?

918
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,156
Let the shot surprise you.

919
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,113
All right, now.

920
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,678
Fire when ready.

921
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,028
Fire!

922
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,357
Think I pinched my finger.

923
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,154
Bless their hearts.

924
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,559
That's hard to do.

925
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,518
This many men and miss that many targets?

926
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,600
Twice?

927
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,880
I'm looking at a line of dead men.

928
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:33,317
You gotta hate what you're firing at!

929
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,992
Hate it! Come on!

930
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,753
Get some gravel in your craw!

931
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,637
Goddamn sons of bitches!

932
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:40,755
All right.

933
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,357
These men need inspiration.

934
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,115
- Inspire them.
- Yeah.

935
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,192
You are Goodnight Robicheaux, after all.

936
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,678
Aint'cha?

937
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,671
I can hit sand, but we need the lead.

938
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,318
Twenty-three confirmed kills at Antietam.

939
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,829
This is one of Connolly's
Confederate sharpshooters.

940
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,753
Dubbed "the Angel of Death."

941
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,388
Do what he does.

942
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,558
He's a legend.

943
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,832
Or is that all you are?

944
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,350
Whoa!

945
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,496
- That's some fancy shooting there.
- He did it. He did it.

946
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,801
- That's why they call him Goodnight.
- You're telling me.

947
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,598
- Can you believe that?
- That's fantastic.

948
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,555
Told you.

949
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:53,318
Y'all go home, polish your rifles,
maybe the glint'll scare 'em off.

950
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,312
We ain't gonna shoot no more?

951
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,752
So this is our trap.

952
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,314
It might work. Pin 'em in there.

953
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:18,400
Well, it might, if we can teach
more than half of these townsfolk

954
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,239
to hit the broad side
of a barn at ten paces.

955
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:23,151
Come up with a few surprises.

956
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,037
We'll need more than a few.

957
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,917
It's a box of death.

958
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,788
So melt the elements, with fervent heat.

959
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,871
Like Sodom and Gomorrah.

960
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,233
What do you think?

961
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,033
Reminds me of this fella I used to know.

962
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,997
Fell off a five-story building.

963
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,480
Passed each floor on the way down.

964
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,677
People inside heard him say,
"So far, so good!"

965
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,189
- He's dead now.
- Yeah.

966
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,831
I make good on my horse yet, Sam?

967
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,672
So far, so good. Let's go get some ammo.

968
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:05,800
Come on.

969
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,951
Mr. Bogue wants this mine stripped
before he gets back.

970
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,079
Move it, you lazy dogs!

971
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,028
Move that gold out!

972
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,878
Fire in the hole!

973
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,478
That sounded like a gunshot!

974
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,399
It's coming from the cliff.

975
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,919
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

976
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,150
- Keep the powder down.
- Look-it, right there.

977
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,272
These ain't Bogue's guys.

978
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,557
Yup. They done killed them all.

979
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,674
This mine is now closed.

980
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,152
You men are free to go.

981
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,918
Or you can stay and fight.

982
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,516
- This will help.
- Yeah.

983
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,557
I've always wanted to blow something up.

984
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,239
Go back inside.

985
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,280
Whoa-hoa-hoa!

986
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,357
Mr. Chisolm, what's this?

987
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,075
Reinforcements.

988
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,196
- What's that on the wagon?
- Dynamite.

989
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,840
Dynamite? Where you gonna put that stuff?

990
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:56,276
- Your place.
- My place? Why my place?

991
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,193
Oh, Lord. Please be careful with it.

992
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:21,232
My town. My gold. How?

993
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:24,312
It was happening so fast, Mr. Bogue,
I couldn't...

994
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,876
There just wasn't enough.

995
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,753
And that I'd be a coward?

996
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,319
Uh...

997
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:35,352
If you didn't come to Rose Creek. Yes, sir.

998
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,670
- He said his name was Chisolm?
- Sam Chisolm.

999
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,990
- From Lincoln?
- Like the president.

1000
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,513
He name his price?

1001
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,670
He didn't have one. Just terms.

1002
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,039
All men have a price.
Isn't that right, Mr. Harp?

1003
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,514
Not this man.

1004
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,357
How many men you say?

1005
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,236
- Seven.
- Seven? Seven?

1006
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,670
Seven men ride into my town,

1007
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,716
dispatch with 22 of the best guns
money can buy?

1008
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:16,896
Is that what you're telling me?

1009
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,720
They fought like three
times that, Mr. Bogue.

1010
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,588
Bullshit.
It was nothing but the element of surprise.

1011
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,039
Hey.

1012
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,479
Surprise.

1013
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,437
You think Rockefeller
had to do things himself?

1014
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,555
Vanderbilt?

1015
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:42,200
Everything I have, I worked for it.

1016
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:47,035
Not like them, with their fancy friends
and their pocketed politicians.

1017
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,475
I want land, you know what I do.

1018
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,669
I take it.

1019
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:54,591
You know what history will say
about Rose Creek?

1020
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,194
Nothing.

1021
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,669
It won't have existed for long enough.

1022
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,637
But history will remember me,

1023
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,669
and what I built.

1024
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:10,436
Mr. Denali,
recruit an army to go back with us.

1025
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,320
Pretty.

1026
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,274
I mean good.

1027
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,519
Your shooting is good. Do it again.

1028
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,831
Sight the lowest part of the V,
cheek resting against the...

1029
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,392
I had a father, thank you.

1030
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,560
I didn't.

1031
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:02,355
Whoo! God dang it, I'm good.

1032
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,833
Why are you doing this, Mr. Faraday?

1033
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:08,075
I mean, why are you here

1034
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,990
fighting someone else's fight?

1035
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,200
I needed my horse back,
and this was the price.

1036
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:19,672
Six pounds of pressure.
That's all that's required to kill a man.

1037
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,796
And they say the nightmares never go away.

1038
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:29,036
Those nightmares,
they keep you up often, Mr. Faraday?

1039
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,513
You might want to wear some pants
if you're fixing to fight.

1040
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,176
Bogue will come from the south.

1041
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,350
Now, he'll prefer high ground,

1042
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,794
but we'll try to lure him into town,
turn it into a shooting gallery.

1043
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:52,078
Now, if we can create enough confusion,
maybe we can get them to break ranks.

1044
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,754
That's a lotta
open space here, Sam.

1045
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,400
I don't really see a way to keep 'em out.

1046
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,795
We're not.
We're gonna let 'em in.

1047
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:06,037
Yes, yes, we force 'em down through here,
leave this open here,

1048
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,111
make this into a graveyard.

1049
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,310
Goodnight, you're our
best shot with a rifle.

1050
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,709
You find high ground
that gives you a clear line of sight,

1051
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,519
you keep Bogue in your sights
once the chaos starts.

1052
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,056
Now, we have some shotguns.

1053
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:20,629
We can get the men who can't shoot,
place 'em in front of each door.

1054
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,438
It's hard to miss a doorway.

1055
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:25,478
We could dig trenches.
Shoot all the way out that way.

1056
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,757
Trouble with taking one of these positions,
you can't ever get down.

1057
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,798
Now, whatever happens, Bogue can't leave.

1058
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:34,096
How do we even know
Bogue's gonna show?

1059
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,873
- He'll show.
- And if he just shoots you in the head?

1060
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,077
Then just shoot him in the head.
Hell, I don't know, uh, avenge me.

1061
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,991
If we can lure him into the bottleneck,
close the door behind him,

1062
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:47,310
each group fire and advance,
we stand a chance.

1063
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:51,839
Worst-case scenario,
all is lost and we blow the mine.

1064
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,200
This right
here is the best spot.

1065
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,630
Can we take position up there? Is it safe?

1066
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,312
Anything left up there to stand on?

1067
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:04,038
Won't have to go too far
to pray for forgiveness.

1068
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,313
There you go.

1069
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:12,190
But there is no forgiveness
for men like you, güero.

1070
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,999
Don't call me güero.

1071
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,638
What's güero mean, anyway?

1072
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:20,315
- Handsome? Debonair?
- Yeah, something like that.

1073
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,992
No, this is our stronghold.

1074
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,832
You funnel them all towards the church.

1075
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,035
Where am I?

1076
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,395
You keep the women and children
safe and out of harm...

1077
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,754
I aim to fight.

1078
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,874
Well, if it comes to that,
then we're all dead, ain't we?

1079
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,677
Let's hope if we die, we've confessed.

1080
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,355
Goody.

1081
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,200
You all right?

1082
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:59,634
What do you say, Sam,
about 50 or 75 yards out?

1083
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,555
That's our trench.

1084
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:06,439
Ditches on each side!
The rest of y'all stand to the side!

1085
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,830
We're gonna need another ditch
by the livery. See that?

1086
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,628
Good, and heave!

1087
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:22,234
- All right, tie it up, now.
- Put your weapon...

1088
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,037
Make sure you paint the whole thing.

1089
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,111
Very smart, smoking, huh?

1090
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,036
- Whoa!
- Three minutes.

1091
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:01,593
That's too much land to cover.

1092
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,113
Where them eggs come from?

1093
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,790
A chicken's ass, you dummy.

1094
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,471
Did I introduce you to my wife?

1095
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:41,356
Her name is Ethel, and I love her.

1096
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,670
Hello, Ethel. Charmed.

1097
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:47,157
And I consider her to
be the love of my life.

1098
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,909
And she is a no-bullshitter,

1099
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,200
- she's a straight shooter.
- All right, calm down, now.

1100
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,993
Put the gun away, son.

1101
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:56,310
- Her name is Ethel.
- Put it away.

1102
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,356
And you'll show her some goddamn respect.

1103
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,759
Yeah.

1104
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,112
It's Maria you can disrespect.

1105
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:06,911
Don't tell Ethel about Maria.

1106
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,118
Wait, wait, wait. My Maria, cabrón? Hmm?

1107
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,148
You have a Maria?

1108
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,760
I have three Marias!

1109
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,513
That's not right.

1110
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,716
The owl followed me here.

1111
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,952
- Nothing's following you.
- I heard the voice.

1112
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,216
- Goody...
- I heard the voice.

1113
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:33,879
- Goody.
- Billy, I heard it.

1114
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:38,238
I pull that trigger in violence again,
I'm gonna die a ghastly death, Billy.

1115
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,878
I heard it.

1116
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,896
- Same thing, it's not the same thing.
- Yeah, it is.

1117
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:47,356
No, a woman's a woman,
a gun's a gun, in the Lord's eye.

1118
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,112
They're just dreams, Goody.

1119
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,031
You talk about guns, you talk about women,

1120
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,960
you talk about 'em separately.
It ain't right.

1121
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,434
Sure it is. Sure it is, my friend.

1122
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,472
I had a wife once.

1123
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:02,997
Had a family. Had some children, too.

1124
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,877
- One time.
- Mmm?

1125
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,349
Now the stitching'll outlast you,
I imagine.

1126
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,715
That's... That's very nice of you.

1127
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,791
I didn't ask you to do that.

1128
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:15,675
I didn't ask you to ask.

1129
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:17,640
Mmm. Mmm.

1130
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,918
You quit staring.

1131
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,353
I didn't ask her to do that.

1132
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,512
Well, the lady just did some poking
and sticking for you.

1133
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:29,108
Maybe you should consider
returning the favor, you know?

1134
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,996
Okay, all right.

1135
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:56,037
- Evening, Mr. Chisolm.
- Preacher.

1136
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,231
- Ah, what a beautiful night it is.
- Yes, it is.

1137
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:05,353
I just wanted to take a moment
to come up here

1138
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:10,069
and to thank you
for everything that you've done for us.

1139
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:14,711
It's been a long while since we've been able
to enjoy an evening quite like tonight.

1140
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,758
Before you and your men arrived,

1141
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:20,594
all of our everyday pleasures
had been taken from us.

1142
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,431
To have those back,
even if only for a moment,

1143
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,040
well, it might not mean that much to you,

1144
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:31,078
but, by God,
we are all eternally grateful to you.

1145
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:34,157
More than you know, preacher.

1146
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:39,911
Last thing I wanna be doing
is playing cards.

1147
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,638
- All night.
- All night.

1148
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,756
You know, some of these folks
ain't gonna make it.

1149
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,795
Yeah.

1150
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,598
- Here we go. Easy. Easy.
- Steady.

1151
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,955
- Throw me the other end!
- Here you go.

1152
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,837
- Whoa, whoa!
- Okay, pues.

1153
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,956
- That far enough?
- That'll do!

1154
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:07,796
All right, two or three more
of those, then we're good.

1155
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,757
That's it, right there.

1156
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:13,390
Look. Look. Look.

1157
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,678
Watch your head now, Teddy.

1158
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,318
Now you can pray for us, Father.

1159
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:26,995
My brother, I will pray for you
until I forget how to pray.

1160
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,672
Water, Mr. Chisolm?

1161
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,600
This is a grand day
in the history books of Rose Creek!

1162
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,111
God bless you, Mr. Chisolm, sir.

1163
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,111
Vindication, brothers and sisters!

1164
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:40,715
- Water, Mr. Horne?
- Thank you, miss.

1165
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,792
For God's glory!

1166
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,515
Bogue comes with his men.

1167
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:06,800
When?

1168
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,632
Dawn.

1169
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:43,512
The Lord said, "Where there
are two or three gathered in My name,

1170
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:44,874
"I will be there."

1171
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,679
You just gonna run off
before you get your cut of the gold?

1172
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:21,077
Well, y'all gonna be dead
this time tomorrow, Sam.

1173
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:24,716
I believe every man's got the right
to choose where he dies, if he can.

1174
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:29,476
Well, that kind of talk
may work with these other sons of bitches,

1175
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:31,198
but I know why you're here.

1176
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,115
And it's not for the benefit of mankind.

1177
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,270
You run out on these people, Goody,

1178
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:40,114
and you gonna be disappointing
more than just them or me.

1179
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,715
Remember what you said to me
when them Billy Yanks

1180
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,756
were kicking my sorry ass
six ways to Sunday?

1181
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,319
- Mmm-hmm. I remember.
- Yeah?

1182
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,437
You asked me why I wanted to save
a piece of rebel trash like you,

1183
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:55,800
and I told you the war was over.

1184
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,136
- But it ain't over, Sam.
- Yes, it is.

1185
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:59,515
No, it isn't. No, the killing's not over.

1186
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:03,070
It keeps going on and on and on.

1187
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:07,438
- I seen so much death.
- The war is over

1188
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,317
for both of us.

1189
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:12,429
What we lost in the fire,

1190
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,032
we'll find in the ashes.

1191
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,114
I need you.

1192
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,758
I've become everything I despise. I...

1193
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:29,718
- I'm faint-hearted...
- Mmm.

1194
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,074
And I'm a coward.

1195
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,388
Bye.

1196
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,677
You remember me as I was.

1197
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:47,720
Come on.

1198
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,913
...hallowed be Thy name.

1199
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,479
Thy kingdom come,

1200
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,837
Thy will be done,

1201
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,229
on Earth as it is in heaven.

1202
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,788
Give us this day our daily bread

1203
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,950
and forgive us our trespasses...

1204
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,393
You all right?

1205
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,474
Well...

1206
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:28,080
Where's Billy?

1207
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,233
It looks like he's started to drink.

1208
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,190
All right. Well...

1209
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,230
Anybody else want to leave, now's the time.

1210
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,436
No one'll hold no ill will towards you.

1211
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,951
What about you?

1212
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,632
I...

1213
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:47,233
I believe I'm gonna see this through.

1214
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:49,197
These people deserve their lives back.

1215
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:56,508
I have nowhere else to go, so I'm in.

1216
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:00,480
You know, I knew that tomorrow
was gonna be a dark day.

1217
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:03,996
And now that there's one less of us,
gonna be darker.

1218
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:09,314
But to be in the service of others

1219
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:13,516
with men that I respect,

1220
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,113
like you all...

1221
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,755
Well, I shouldn't have
to ask for more than that.

1222
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:55,272
- I'll see you in the morning.
- All right.

1223
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,114
I'm hungry.

1224
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,070
Wait. Hell, you speak English?

1225
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:04,280
So?

1226
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:08,757
You little shit.
We got a lot to talk about.

1227
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,038
Don't walk away from me!

1228
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,952
I'll take his place.

1229
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:48,116
- Who?
- Goodnight.

1230
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:52,117
Just saw him ride out.

1231
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:31,595
Thank you for the strength
that you have given me.

1232
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:38,195
It's time.

1233
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:39,696
Come on, children!

1234
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:41,096
- Come on.
- Children, quickly, please, go on.

1235
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:43,475
- Let's go.
- Come on, hurry!

1236
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:45,439
Hurry, children!

1237
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:47,400
Come on, come on.

1238
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:51,318
Now get on down in there. Come on.

1239
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:52,913
Watch your step.

1240
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:08,716
Easy, easy.

1241
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:10,880
Steady.

1242
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:18,880
Hyah, hyah.

1243
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,239
Easy now, easy.

1244
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:33,839
Chisolm?

1245
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,034
It's him, all right.

1246
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:00,440
It's only minutes.

1247
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:01,576
Shh!

1248
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:04,592
We're safe. Nothing to fear.

1249
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:05,680
Yeah.

1250
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,078
Mr. Denali.

1251
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:42,190
Keep it clear!

1252
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:44,229
- Come on!
- Steady!

1253
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:48,960
That's it, straight on!

1254
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:51,834
- Mask up.
- All together. Come on.

1255
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:56,949
Bring 'em up!

1256
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,789
Steady on, boys! Steady on!

1257
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:06,159
Mind your sister.

1258
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:09,228
Come on, line up, boys.
Steady on, steady on!

1259
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:14,080
Hyah! Hyah!

1260
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:22,096
Shoot whoever you see!

1261
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:24,429
Don't spare a soul, do you hear me?

1262
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,016
Go around! Go around!

1263
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,473
Go through the miners' camp!

1264
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,868
Just stay with me, boys!

1265
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:49,557
Drain all the blood
from their bodies, you hear me?

1266
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:52,719
I'm counting.

1267
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:53,835
Five.

1268
01:37:57,640 --> 01:37:58,640
Four.

1269
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:07,196
Three.

1270
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,194
Two.

1271
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:16,312
Let's go, come on!

1272
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:22,595
One!

1273
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:25,915
One!

1274
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:38,468
Hold! Hold!

1275
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,835
Shh, shh, shh.

1276
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:41,955
Keep your line!

1277
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:43,520
Head to the left!

1278
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,876
Pull!

1279
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:51,136
Watch your back coming in!

1280
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:52,160
Get him!

1281
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:56,800
I can't see 'em from here!

1282
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,157
Hey! Easy, easy, easy!

1283
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:09,960
Let's do it!

1284
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:15,109
- Now!
- Come on!

1285
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,111
- Let's go!
- Shoot, shoot!

1286
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,635
Dig in! Keep shooting!

1287
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:26,869
I got him!

1288
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:32,756
Here they come! Stand your ground!

1289
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:40,074
- Through here, go!
- Cut him off round that bend!

1290
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:46,760
Get him! Go!

1291
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:53,635
Watch your right!

1292
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:09,228
- Shoot! Go around, fire!
- Head him off, over there!

1293
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:14,829
There's another one up top!

1294
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:21,120
Over there!

1295
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:28,758
"Although I walk through the valley

1296
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:31,115
"of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil

1297
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:34,078
"for Thou art with me."

1298
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,600
That's it! Unload on him!

1299
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:46,995
I got him!

1300
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:50,269
- Here!
- There!

1301
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:04,953
Go 'round, go 'round!

1302
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,553
- Ain't no way through!
- Come on!

1303
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:10,269
Push the wagon!

1304
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:17,714
Get to the church!

1305
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:21,960
Let's go, come on!

1306
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:31,598
Now! Now!

1307
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,232
Hyah! Hyah!

1308
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,416
There's too many of 'em.
They're gonna kill all of us!

1309
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:39,670
No! No! Stay down!

1310
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:40,909
Keep shooting!

1311
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:45,080
Whoa!

1312
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,160
Whoa!

1313
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,199
What are you doing there?

1314
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:05,713
Get back to the livery stable!

1315
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,474
Just keep moving!

1316
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:09,559
They're gonna kill us all!

1317
01:42:36,440 --> 01:42:37,793
We're outnumbered!

1318
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:38,955
Go around the barn!

1319
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,632
We're clear, we're clear!

1320
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:50,515
Keep shooting!

1321
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:01,994
Light up that wagon!

1322
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,636
- They're on that roof!
- Push them wagons!

1323
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:08,075
Block 'em in!

1324
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:10,555
They got us trapped!

1325
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:12,154
Ain't no way out!

1326
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:13,629
Go, go, go!

1327
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:27,800
Open 'em up!

1328
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,319
Go get the wagon.

1329
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,029
Head to the church!

1330
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:47,074
Into the church!

1331
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,233
Bring the fight to these cowards!

1332
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:50,878
Yeah, let's kill these bastards!

1333
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:54,431
- Wagons! Wagons! Let's go.
- Hurry, güero!

1334
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,560
Light 'em up and lock
these sons of bitches in here!

1335
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:59,198
Lock 'em up! Let's...

1336
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:00,315
Güero, man!

1337
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:06,069
- Light it up!
- Yeah.

1338
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:07,680
That's far enough. Leave it, let's go!

1339
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:15,913
Are you okay, güero?

1340
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:19,472
So far, so good.

1341
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:33,880
Can't get out! It's a dead end!

1342
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:38,636
- We're trapped!
- Go the other way!

1343
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:44,913
- We still have men there, sir.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

1344
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:46,675
I'm going!

1345
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:49,029
- Go.
- Keep shooting!

1346
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:50,189
They're trapped!

1347
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:58,439
Keep shooting!

1348
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:08,879
Keep shooting, güerito!

1349
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:21,150
Go 'round! It's blocked!

1350
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:48,720
Now!

1351
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:52,595
Come on!

1352
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:57,953
They got the devil's breath!

1353
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:00,036
They got a goddamn Gatling gun!

1354
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:09,795
Let 'em have it.

1355
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:13,715
Let's run!

1356
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,069
Get the fuck...

1357
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:16,794
Gavin, damn it!

1358
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:27,712
Take cover!

1359
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,791
- Go on, Miss Emma.
- Get down!

1360
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:34,960
They have a Gatling gun!
A Gatling gun!

1361
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,395
Get inside! Inside, inside!

1362
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:40,589
- Billy!
- Hey, Goody!

1363
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:03,029
- Go! Gun!
- Gatling gun!

1364
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:04,758
Move, get out of the way, go on!

1365
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:11,879
Get down, get down!

1366
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:27,189
Go on, Miss Emma, go!

1367
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:50,392
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

1368
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:52,675
They're reloading! Stay down! Stay down!

1369
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:54,432
Get down!

1370
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:55,555
The children.

1371
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:56,755
- Get down.
- Get down!

1372
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:07,114
- Get down against the wall, come on!
- Hey, Goody!

1373
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:09,635
- Yeah, I see 'em, I see 'em.
- Let's go, Billy!

1374
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:12,520
We gotta get these kids outta here.

1375
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,159
All right, everybody, come on.

1376
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:16,576
- Everyone, up the stairs.
- Quick, quick.

1377
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:18,000
- Quick, quick, quick.
- Be careful.

1378
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:23,716
Can't walk. They got my leg, sir.

1379
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:28,274
Schoolteacher, what are you doing up here?

1380
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:29,634
I want to stay.

1381
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:31,073
Come on, now, get outta here!

1382
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:32,760
Wrap that leg! Stop the bleeding.

1383
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:37,676
Find some ammo. You did good...

1384
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,909
Shit!

1385
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:47,840
Ah!

1386
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:56,552
We are giants put on this earth

1387
01:48:56,640 --> 01:49:00,076
to rid it of evil and to
keep all that is good!

1388
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:07,278
- Straight to the field. Come on.
- Quickly. Quickly!

1389
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:08,736
- Go on, children, hurry.
- Come on.

1390
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:09,829
- Quickly.
- To the field.

1391
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,313
- Keep going, keep going!
- Anthony!

1392
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:51,628
- Quickly now.
- Anthony!

1393
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:53,278
- Pa! Quickly!
- Go, go, go.

1394
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:54,713
- You can't...
- Go, go, go!

1395
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:56,720
- Come on. Stay together.
- Let's go! Go, go, go.

1396
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:58,552
Keep going! To the ridge line!

1397
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:00,159
Come on. Just keep going.

1398
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:01,838
Get down. Get down!

1399
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,353
Come on. Come on.

1400
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:20,152
Get down!

1401
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:21,835
They're coming!

1402
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:23,911
We're running outta ammo, boys!

1403
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:27,357
- Shit, Billy.
- I knew you'd come back.

1404
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:30,918
You did, did you?
How'd you know that?

1405
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:35,594
- You forgot this.
- Whoo!

1406
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,348
- All right. Let's do it.
- Yeah!

1407
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:37,997
You're a disgrace.

1408
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:13,560
Over there! Over there!

1409
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:15,600
Ammo, ammo!

1410
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:17,993
This is all we've got.

1411
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:22,279
This reminds me of
what my daddy used to say.

1412
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:24,675
What's that, Goody?

1413
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:30,520
What?

1414
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:33,353
Well, my daddy used to say
a lot of things, you know.

1415
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:40,190
- You all right?
- Hell yeah.

1416
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:41,998
So far, so good.

1417
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:43,718
I might need a new vest.

1418
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:48,716
Damn, we gotta do something
about that gun.

1419
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:02,435
Hey.

1420
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:03,909
You know what?

1421
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:06,153
We're even.

1422
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:07,992
For the horse. You don't owe me anything.

1423
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:10,354
Well, you owe me.

1424
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:12,760
What's that?

1425
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:14,549
Cover.

1426
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:17,119
Come on! Come on!

1427
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:37,200
Over here!

1428
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:39,914
- This side, Goody.
- Hyah!

1429
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,719
- Ride, Faraday, ride!
- Hyah!

1430
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:47,880
What do we have here?

1431
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:04,999
Get the two in the back.

1432
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:08,960
Hit the steeple.

1433
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:19,315
I got him!

1434
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:36,995
Oh, Goody.

1435
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:47,680
Hah!

1436
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:48,480
Come on, boy!

1437
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:03,160
Why don't you stay down, boy?

1438
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:54,753
Let's go, boys.

1439
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:56,600
Yeah. Yeah.

1440
01:56:58,120 --> 01:56:59,120
Dynamite.

1441
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:01,356
I've always been lucky with one-eyed jacks.

1442
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:02,869
Dynamite!

1443
01:57:56,360 --> 01:57:57,509
Bring them

1444
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:02,151
Bring them in

1445
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:11,154
Chisolm?

1446
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:14,633
Should I know that name?

1447
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:17,630
You should know it from your obituary.

1448
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,035
Ah.

1449
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:22,233
We connected, somehow?

1450
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:24,436
14th of October, 1867.

1451
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:31,397
Did you hire renegade Greys to pillage
and steal land in Kansas?

1452
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:36,238
Homesteaders.

1453
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:39,519
Good people trying
to make a life for themselves,

1454
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:40,715
like these people here.

1455
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:46,596
If God didn't want 'em sheared,

1456
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:48,750
he wouldn't have made 'em sheep.

1457
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:10,109
Ahhh!

1458
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,035
No.

1459
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:18,120
Pick it up.

1460
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:23,391
Go on, pick it up. Pick it up.

1461
02:00:23,480 --> 02:00:24,595
Pick it up!

1462
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:56,637
You a God-fearing man? Huh?

1463
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:03,755
Yeah.

1464
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:27,630
Please, just leave.

1465
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:33,871
Please leave me be! Please!

1466
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:40,193
Please.

1467
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:43,192
I... I beg your pardon.

1468
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:47,552
I've done you wrong.

1469
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:48,959
God.

1470
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:54,879
I want you to pray with me.

1471
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:56,955
All right?

1472
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:00,115
Come on.

1473
02:02:04,120 --> 02:02:05,120
All right?

1474
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:07,551
- Ask for forgiveness.
- Wait.

1475
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:09,633
- Yeah, you can.
- I...

1476
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:12,757
You close your eyes, and you pray.

1477
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,673
Pray for my mother

1478
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:20,159
that your men raped.

1479
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:23,796
Go on, pray. You pray.

1480
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:28,560
Pray for my two sisters...

1481
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:31,478
...that your men murdered.

1482
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:34,995
That they strung up.

1483
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:37,736
Did they pray
when they put the rope around my neck?

1484
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:39,113
Did they pray then?

1485
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:43,120
Pray, pray.

1486
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:46,273
I remember. Chisolm...

1487
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:48,359
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1488
02:02:48,440 --> 02:02:49,873
- I remember.
- You remember?

1489
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:54,234
I said pray.

1490
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:56,233
No.

1491
02:02:57,400 --> 02:02:58,879
Hallelujah.

1492
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:04,196
Killing me won't give you
the satisfaction you want!

1493
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:08,198
"Our Father..."

1494
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:09,280
Say it.

1495
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:11,957
"Who art in heaven.

1496
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:16,393
"Hallowed be Thy name." Say it.

1497
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:21,395
"Thy kingdom come..." Go on.

1498
02:03:22,120 --> 02:03:23,360
Come on.

1499
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:25,114
Say it.

1500
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:49,879
Amen.

1501
02:05:08,080 --> 02:05:09,274
Faraday?

1502
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:45,079
Thank you, Father.

1503
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:52,429
Preacher.

1504
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:57,191
I'm gonna take good care
of your men, Mr. Chisolm.

1505
02:05:57,320 --> 02:05:58,548
Proper.

1506
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:03,359
You made it? You made it through!

1507
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:16,474
Let's go.

1508
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:18,896
God bless you, Mr. Chisolm.

1509
02:06:18,920 --> 02:06:20,280
Take care of Jack, Teddy.

1510
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:31,550
- Miss Emma.
- Thank you.

1511
02:06:42,040 --> 02:06:44,474
- Thank you so much, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Chisolm.

1512
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:46,630
- Thank you!
- Thank you, Mr. Chisolm.

1513
02:06:46,720 --> 02:06:48,472
Godspeed, men.

1514
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:54,519
Mom, is it over?

1515
02:06:56,360 --> 02:06:57,360
Mommy?

1516
02:06:58,680 --> 02:07:00,079
- Mom!
- Sweetheart!

1517
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:10,033
That's all right.
As long as I can walk, I'll be fine.

1518
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:52,470
Whatever they were in life,

1519
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:55,273
here, at the end,

1520
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:59,911
each man stood with courage and honor.

1521
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:04,152
They fought for the ones
who couldn't fight for themselves,

1522
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:07,158
and they died for them, too.

1523
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:10,636
All to win something
that didn't belong to them.

1524
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:13,559
It was

1525
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:16,271
magnificent.
