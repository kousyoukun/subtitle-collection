(tense music)

00:01:00,418 --> 00:01:02,687
Darnell, stop, police!

00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:05,490
(dramatic music)

00:01:24,944 --> 00:01:26,312
(garbage clattering)

10
00:01:26,345 --> 00:01:27,380
Darnell, wait, wait, wait, wait!

11
00:01:27,412 --> 00:01:29,081
I just want to talk.

12
00:01:38,257 --> 00:01:39,392
Darnell, wait!

13
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:42,494
No, take the stairs, stairs!

14
00:01:42,527 --> 00:01:44,796
Go around, block the alley.

15
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:48,566
Wait, man, wait please.

16
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,635
This is 120 pursuing
the suspect on foot

17
00:01:50,669 --> 00:01:51,703
in the alley
Copy that, 120.

18
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:52,537
(gunshots)

19
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,538
Shit.

20
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,974
Hold on, hold on.

21
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:59,644
Hey, hey, kid, look
at me, look at me.

22
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,480
Listen to me, I'm gonna
put pressure on it.

23
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:03,748
Police!
You gotta hold on.

24
00:02:03,782 --> 00:02:05,952
All right, call an ambulance.

25
00:02:05,985 --> 00:02:07,320
All right, you gotta hold on.

26
00:02:07,353 --> 00:02:08,321
Where's the shooter?

27
00:02:08,354 --> 00:02:09,654
He drove off.

28
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:11,257
You gotta hold on.

29
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,426
Stay with me, come on!

30
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:16,795
Come on.

31
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:25,171
Captain.

32
00:02:25,204 --> 00:02:26,038
Douglas.

33
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,575
The Captain's got a reason...

34
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:35,580
(radio chatter in background)
(sirens in distance)

35
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:37,450
Did you find it?

36
00:02:37,482 --> 00:02:39,085
We don't even have casings.

37
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:39,919
They're ghosts.

38
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,320
Did you see the shooter?

39
00:02:41,354 --> 00:02:43,555
No, I think these murders
are over territory.

40
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:45,557
Well, I'd like to talk to him.

41
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,593
Did you ever think that maybe
he wasn't just hiding from us?

42
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,997
I told you to wait.

43
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,831
Well, I thought that
he was gonna bolt.

44
00:02:51,864 --> 00:02:55,201
I told you to wait.

45
00:02:55,234 --> 00:02:58,404
I am your captain, Steve,
I gave you an order.

46
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:04,642
I'm putting you on patrol.

47
00:03:05,677 --> 00:03:06,578
What?

48
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:08,513
I said I'm fucking
putting you on patrol

49
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:10,548
until I talk to the Colonel
and I figure what the hell

50
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:11,417
to do with you.

51
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:13,252
Captain.

52
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,488
Captain!

53
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,793
(soft somber music)

54
00:03:56,594 --> 00:03:57,430
Hey, buddy.

55
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:01,333
I thought you were going to bed.

56
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:06,172
I have another night.

57
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,606
Can you do these
before school tomorrow?

58
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,741
You know there's an
app for that, right?

59
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:12,411
I'll show you app, show you app.

60
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:14,847
You'll do 'em?

61
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,648
I'll do 'em.

62
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:17,682
Thank you.

63
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:21,854
It's a big day tomorrow.

64
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,122
Get some sleep.

65
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:36,402
(upbeat whimsical music)

66
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:03,229
- Chris!
- Yeah?

67
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:04,662
Do you want some shrimp?

68
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:05,965
I don't know.

69
00:05:05,998 --> 00:05:10,970
(upbeat whimsical music)
(indistinct chattering)

70
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,817
Your parents are still up.

71
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:27,853
You're such a worrier.

72
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:34,792
Team Dork?

73
00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:35,828
Team Dork.

74
00:05:38,063 --> 00:05:39,231
God I can't believe
you didn't tell me

75
00:05:39,265 --> 00:05:40,665
your parents were still up.

76
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:44,136
(upbeat whimsical music)

77
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,610
Grant, what the hell?

78
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:53,946
You forgot to unlock the gate.

79
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,449
We had to crawl
through the bushes.

80
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,716
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

81
00:05:59,852 --> 00:06:00,920
Team Dork?

82
00:06:03,755 --> 00:06:05,757
(mock groaning)
(laughing)

83
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,060
(shushing)

84
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:14,233
Is it nice kissing like that?

85
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:15,367
It's okay.

86
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:17,670
Making out with Brandy
Torgenson at the pool

87
00:06:17,702 --> 00:06:19,605
once this summer does
not make you an expert.

88
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:20,973
It was more than once.

89
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,708
It looks messy.

90
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:26,345
I think as you get better
at it there's less spit.

91
00:06:29,747 --> 00:06:31,083
They'll be at it for
awhile, we're good.

92
00:06:31,116 --> 00:06:33,018
You know when your
parents are doing it?

93
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:33,886
Ew.

94
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,187
They're dealer came by.

95
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:36,522
That means date night.

96
00:06:36,555 --> 00:06:38,357
They get loopy and
they do it for hours

97
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,026
but lucky for us, I
found their stash.

98
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,628
Criminal behavior,
that's what this is.

99
00:06:42,661 --> 00:06:43,495
Okay, let's go.

100
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,234
So why is this thing a big deal?

101
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:49,501
It's a total lunar eclipse

102
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,303
when the moon's super
close to the Earth.

103
00:06:51,337 --> 00:06:52,204
Why's it's red?

104
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:56,008
The light hitting the
moon is from the sun

105
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,611
and the sun's light
comes to our atmosphere

106
00:06:58,644 --> 00:06:59,712
and our atmosphere refracts it

107
00:06:59,744 --> 00:07:01,714
which messes with
the color spectrum

108
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:05,351
so it looks red, kinda
like the sun at sunset.

109
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:06,218
It's cool, right?

110
00:07:06,252 --> 00:07:07,152
It's weird.

111
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:08,153
It's creepy.

112
00:07:08,187 --> 00:07:09,421
Back in the day, people
thought the blood moon

113
00:07:09,455 --> 00:07:10,788
meant the god's were angry.

114
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:12,658
Hell yeah, if I walked
out of my castle

115
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:14,660
and I saw that, it be
like the world's ending.

116
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:17,029
Of course in your fantasy
you have a castle.

117
00:07:17,863 --> 00:07:20,765
Yeah but why did they
think it meant something?

118
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:22,735
Humans aren't the
center of the universe.

119
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:25,137
Well, I mean, some of us are.

120
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,573
You really think that a
little bit though, don't you?

121
00:07:27,606 --> 00:07:29,675
Yeah but you're one
of billions of people

122
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,878
on one small rock out
of billions of rocks.

123
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,214
There's a huge universe out
there in constant motion.

124
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,516
Sometimes things just
get in each other's way.

125
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:38,917
All right, Neal deGrasse,
what did you read

126
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:40,486
in your big thick nerd book?

127
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,687
Everything's random?

128
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,889
There's no meaning to anything?

129
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:44,723
What?

130
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:46,791
It wasn't a book.

131
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:49,794
It was a website.

132
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:50,629
(laughing)

133
00:07:50,663 --> 00:07:52,331
And I didn't say it was random.

134
00:07:52,364 --> 00:07:55,401
The universe works beautifully.

135
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:58,270
Maybe there's a plan, maybe
that's why we're so intelligent.

136
00:07:58,304 --> 00:08:00,939
Maybe we're the universe
trying to figure itself out.

137
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,678
I don't know if
it's the weed or you

138
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:07,846
but my brain just
melted a little bit.

139
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,915
Talk like that at Cold Spring,
they're gonna kill you.

140
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,817
Not everyone can afford 30
grand a year for Gilman.

141
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:15,287
You know it's not like they
gave me a choice, right?

142
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:16,855
I don't want to be
away from you guys

143
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:17,890
and who's gonna watch your back

144
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:19,391
with all those big ass seniors?

145
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:20,592
I will.

146
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,528
I kick way more ass
than you do, anyway.

147
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:23,429
Okay.

148
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:25,197
I don't need anyone
to watch my back.

149
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,965
It's gonna be different
at this school.

150
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:28,300
Really?

151
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:30,169
'Cause that's what you said
at the start of sixth grade

152
00:08:30,202 --> 00:08:31,070
and they're still
making fun of you.

153
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:32,104
I'm gonna make it different.

154
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,772
All right, dude,
just be careful.

155
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:35,974
Two kids from there
got shot last month?

156
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:39,445
That school is for real.

157
00:08:47,886 --> 00:08:50,456
(upbeat music)

158
00:08:56,695 --> 00:08:59,798
(electronic beeping)

159
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:11,276
Move it.

160
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:15,849
(bell ringing)

161
00:09:19,118 --> 00:09:20,719
Does anyone know how
many branches there are

162
00:09:20,753 --> 00:09:22,388
in the US government?

163
00:09:23,288 --> 00:09:25,758
Come on, guys.

164
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:26,759
Remind me you're?

165
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:28,093
Marcus.

166
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:29,428
Marcus.
Three.

167
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:30,729
That's right.

168
00:09:30,763 --> 00:09:32,898
Can anyone name one of them?

169
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:33,766
Anyone?

170
00:09:35,968 --> 00:09:36,836
Yes.

171
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,903
Legislative.

172
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:39,438
Legislative, great.
Little suck up.

173
00:09:39,471 --> 00:09:40,739
And there are two more.

174
00:09:40,773 --> 00:09:42,741
I'd like to hear
from someone else.

175
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:43,575
Emily.

176
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:45,577
Uh, the president, right?

177
00:09:45,611 --> 00:09:47,713
The executive
branch, we call it.

178
00:09:47,746 --> 00:09:49,548
And can anyone guess the third?

179
00:09:49,581 --> 00:09:50,682
Cassie?

180
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,485
Uh, um.

181
00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:55,788
I should know this.

182
00:09:55,821 --> 00:09:58,457
All right, folks,
let's write this down.

183
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,692
Executive, legislative.

184
00:10:02,094 --> 00:10:04,530
Uh, the supreme court.

185
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,331
Supreme court, that's right.

186
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:07,633
Three columns, folks.

187
00:10:09,201 --> 00:10:10,402
Marcus Jackson.

188
00:10:10,436 --> 00:10:11,737
Still a smart kid, huh?

189
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,139
I used to babysit Marcus
back when you were like,

190
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:16,141
what seven or eight right?

191
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:17,009
Something like that.

192
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:18,644
You know, I'd love
to say, oh my god,

193
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:20,612
you've gotten so big but uh.

194
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:21,713
Hey, beautiful.

195
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:22,548
Oh my god.

196
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:23,682
Bryan, Jesus.

197
00:10:23,715 --> 00:10:25,417
What's up?
This is Marcus.

198
00:10:25,451 --> 00:10:26,251
He helped me in class.

199
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:27,453
Like you need any help.

200
00:10:27,486 --> 00:10:28,922
She's smarter than I'll ever be.

201
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:30,722
Marcus, this is my boyfriend.

202
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,191
Bryan.

203
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:33,692
I know, I've seen you play.

204
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,464
So y'all went to
Keatonsville Middle?

205
00:10:38,497 --> 00:10:40,466
Yeah.
We went to Arbudis.

206
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:42,334
Bunch of stoners.

207
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:43,302
Myself included.

208
00:10:43,335 --> 00:10:44,470
(laughing)

209
00:10:44,503 --> 00:10:46,705
I'm Carl, this is Ned.

210
00:10:46,738 --> 00:10:48,842
He's a senior but
he chills with us.

211
00:10:49,675 --> 00:10:50,809
Seniors are lame.

212
00:10:50,844 --> 00:10:52,544
Yo, we're going to hell
house after school.

213
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:53,947
You guys should come by.

214
00:10:53,979 --> 00:10:55,047
What's hell house?

215
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,448
An old common in the woods.

216
00:10:56,482 --> 00:10:58,016
People go there to
smoke weed and stuff.

217
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:58,885
It's haunted.

218
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:02,688
She said you're
good with computers?

219
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:04,490
He's awesome with computers.

220
00:11:04,523 --> 00:11:06,325
Show them the phone thing.

221
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:08,660
Come on, man, what's
the phone thing?

222
00:11:08,694 --> 00:11:09,795
It's just a little trick.

223
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,032
All right, they're
like 20 phones nearby

224
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:15,767
with their Bluetooth turned on.

225
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:16,768
You really want to
keep your phone private

226
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,804
you need to turn that
shit in airplane mode.

227
00:11:21,106 --> 00:11:23,509
(soft music)

228
00:11:24,776 --> 00:11:27,446
(duck quacking)

229
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:32,518
Wait, wait, what?

230
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:34,520
Do it again, do it again.

231
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:37,756
(duck quacking)

232
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:38,757
(laughing)

233
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,591
Oh snap, man.

234
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,560
(laughing)

235
00:11:41,593 --> 00:11:42,528
You like that?

236
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:44,496
You're gonna love this.

237
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:49,701
(woman moaning)

238
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:53,105
(laughing)

239
00:11:53,138 --> 00:11:54,606
Dude, you're so freaky, man.

240
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,309
(woman moaning)

241
00:11:59,077 --> 00:11:59,879
Hey!

242
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:02,581
Hey, who's messing
with my phone?

243
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:04,783
Huh?

244
00:12:04,816 --> 00:12:07,319
(tense music)

245
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:12,157
Mr. Howard, did you
want to chat with me?

246
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:16,194
Ms. Byprin, everything's fine.

247
00:12:18,597 --> 00:12:20,766
That's Clay Howard.

248
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:23,302
(tense music)

249
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,608
(soft piano music)

250
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,217
(kids chattering)

251
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:43,488
Is Grant coming or what?

252
00:12:43,522 --> 00:12:45,123
I don't know, he
hasn't texted back.

253
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:47,626
Shit this place is creepy.

254
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:49,628
I know, right?

255
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:50,629
(shouts)

256
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:51,864
(laughing)

257
00:12:51,898 --> 00:12:53,032
Got you.

258
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:54,433
All right, come on, guys.

259
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:55,300
We're up there.

260
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:57,603
Is Ned coming?

261
00:12:57,636 --> 00:12:59,338
Man, that joker got detention.

262
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:03,042
Yo, what up, players?

263
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:05,744
So we start hearing this noise.

264
00:13:05,777 --> 00:13:06,778
Shut up.

265
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:08,915
And we think it's like
the groundskeeper guy

266
00:13:08,948 --> 00:13:10,482
who's always chasing people off.

267
00:13:10,515 --> 00:13:11,817
So we put the campfire out

268
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,419
and then we see it.

269
00:13:16,788 --> 00:13:18,958
Right over there.

270
00:13:18,992 --> 00:13:22,895
Looked like a woman wearing
like a nun's habit or some shit.

271
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:24,196
A soft glow behind.

272
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:26,131
You guys want to
talk about a ghost?

273
00:13:26,164 --> 00:13:27,666
Talk about Darnell.

274
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:30,769
People are dying
around here, for real.

275
00:13:30,802 --> 00:13:32,005
Do you know what
happened to him?

276
00:13:32,038 --> 00:13:34,406
I heard some city guys
been coming around

277
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,475
telling the small
time county dealers

278
00:13:36,508 --> 00:13:39,544
to step off and if they don't.

279
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:43,315
I'm cool.

280
00:13:46,251 --> 00:13:47,719
What's the matter, man?

281
00:13:48,553 --> 00:13:50,455
You don't like that bud?

282
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,492
Now see, you gotta
try that shit.

283
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:55,028
I sold them that shit.

284
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:56,595
That's my best
shit, right, Carl?

285
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:57,462
Yeah.

286
00:13:58,363 --> 00:13:59,197
New blood.

287
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,135
What's your name?

288
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:03,036
Holly.

289
00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:04,403
Holly.

290
00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:05,905
And who's your friend, Holly?

291
00:14:07,606 --> 00:14:10,509
I'm um, Marcus?

292
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:12,111
You're not sure?

293
00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:15,714
Okay we got Holly,
we got Um Marcus.

294
00:14:15,747 --> 00:14:16,548
I'm Clay.

295
00:14:16,581 --> 00:14:17,749
We heard.

296
00:14:17,783 --> 00:14:19,317
Heard about me already.

297
00:14:19,351 --> 00:14:21,154
Shit, curious little
freshman, huh?

298
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:22,855
Can you get your
arm off me, please?

299
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:24,222
So what did you hear
about me, Holly, hmm?

300
00:14:24,256 --> 00:14:25,892
I heard you were an asshole.

301
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:28,493
(laughing)

302
00:14:28,527 --> 00:14:31,864
Shit, honest I like it.

303
00:14:31,898 --> 00:14:33,900
So since we're being honest.

304
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:37,136
Why did you go through
my phone, Um Marcus?

305
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:40,173
I don't know what
you're talking about.

306
00:14:40,205 --> 00:14:41,773
Boy, if you're gonna
keep lying to me

307
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:43,542
you gotta practice.

308
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:45,544
Get off.

309
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:48,246
What's wrong, huh?

310
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,916
She said move your arm.

311
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:52,617
Huh?

312
00:14:52,651 --> 00:14:54,120
She said move your arm.

313
00:14:56,155 --> 00:14:57,123
Get up.

314
00:14:57,156 --> 00:14:58,757
Get up.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

315
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,758
Shut up.

316
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,226
(tense music)

317
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:02,895
You know I have some
tricks of my own, too.

318
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:06,264
Press a button, make a noise.

319
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:08,835
Robbie, what was that
thing he made the phone do?

320
00:15:08,868 --> 00:15:09,869
Tweet tweet, right?

321
00:15:09,902 --> 00:15:10,702
Yeah.

322
00:15:10,736 --> 00:15:12,004
Yeah, tweet tweet.

323
00:15:12,038 --> 00:15:13,940
Now where is that button?

324
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:15,340
Leave him alone.

325
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:18,443
Wrong button.

326
00:15:20,213 --> 00:15:21,848
I guess we gotta
try another one.

327
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:22,849
Ow, ow.

328
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:23,682
Stop it.

329
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:24,516
Yo, relax, yo.

330
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,350
Calm her down.

331
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,418
Do it.

332
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:27,252
Okay, okay.

333
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:28,121
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Tweet tweet.

334
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:28,955
No, no, no.

335
00:15:28,988 --> 00:15:29,788
You didn't sell me there.

336
00:15:29,821 --> 00:15:30,622
You didn't sell me.

337
00:15:30,655 --> 00:15:31,891
Tweet tweet.

338
00:15:31,924 --> 00:15:32,724
What did you do with
my phone, Marcus?

339
00:15:32,758 --> 00:15:33,893
Nothing, I swear.

340
00:15:33,926 --> 00:15:34,994
Bullshit.

341
00:15:35,027 --> 00:15:35,895
Clay.

342
00:15:35,928 --> 00:15:36,728
You put some kind of
software on there,

343
00:15:36,762 --> 00:15:37,496
some kind of spy fucker?
No, no, no.

344
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:38,898
It's just some stupid trick.

345
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:43,836
Robbie, what was that
one he did in my phone?

346
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,504
(mock moaning)

347
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:46,772
Uh huh.

348
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:47,606
(laughing)

349
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:48,440
Yeah.

350
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:50,076
(mock moaning)

351
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:52,410
Now where's that button?

352
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:53,812
(groaning)

353
00:15:53,846 --> 00:15:55,982
(tense music)

354
00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:57,083
Stop!

355
00:15:57,116 --> 00:15:58,717
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

356
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,052
Let go of me.

357
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:01,220
Hey, relax.

358
00:16:01,254 --> 00:16:02,454
Hey.
Let go of me!

359
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:04,623
Quit it, hey relax.

360
00:16:04,656 --> 00:16:07,160
(tense music)

361
00:16:11,264 --> 00:16:13,099
Don't you ever touch
my phone again.

362
00:16:13,132 --> 00:16:13,966
Clay!

363
00:16:20,106 --> 00:16:22,175
Hey, Cassie, what's up?

364
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,475
What the hell are you doing?

365
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:24,911
Oh, just having some fun.

366
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:26,344
Okay, just having some fun?

367
00:16:26,378 --> 00:16:27,612
Are you kidding me?
Messing with the kid.

368
00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:28,480
Hey.

369
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:41,526
(phone chiming)

370
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:48,167
What is it?

371
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:55,407
Tweet tweet (horn honking).

372
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,575
Tweet tweet (horn honking)

373
00:16:56,608 --> 00:17:00,847
tweet tweet (horn honking)
tweet tweet (horn honking).

374
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,480
Just don't look at it.

375
00:17:02,514 --> 00:17:03,348
Give it to me.

376
00:17:09,754 --> 00:17:11,324
Come on.

377
00:17:11,356 --> 00:17:13,025
(tense music)

378
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:14,759
(train horn blowing)

379
00:17:14,793 --> 00:17:18,130
(soft reflective music)

380
00:17:20,132 --> 00:17:20,967
Come on.

381
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:24,337
Come on.

382
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:31,978
This is what we need to be
doing right now, really?

383
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:33,846
Don't you want to
check your phone?

384
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,464
Remember how long it took
for us to build this?

385
00:17:52,497 --> 00:17:54,934
Half of the summer
after sixth grade.

386
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:56,269
We were gonna live here.

387
00:17:57,336 --> 00:17:59,138
Never go home.

388
00:17:59,171 --> 00:18:00,505
Doesn't work that way.

389
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:04,210
I've got to go back to
that school tomorrow

390
00:18:04,243 --> 00:18:05,177
and they're all gonna
know that I'm the kid

391
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:06,979
from the video who
got his ass beat

392
00:18:07,013 --> 00:18:08,247
and cried his guts out.

393
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:13,152
I thought it would be
different at this school.

394
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:23,728
Why don't we stop by the
hospital in the morning

395
00:18:23,762 --> 00:18:26,198
and just take a look at you.

396
00:18:26,232 --> 00:18:28,067
I'm fine, Ma, it
was just a fall.

397
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:30,870
You gonna be okay
at that school?

398
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:32,238
If it was good enough
for him, it's good enough

399
00:18:32,271 --> 00:18:33,172
for me, right?

400
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:35,341
You talk to him lately?

401
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:40,179
I was thinking today
that if he was around

402
00:18:40,212 --> 00:18:43,282
maybe we could afford
that school Grant goes to

403
00:18:43,316 --> 00:18:45,284
and maybe you'd have him around

404
00:18:45,318 --> 00:18:46,385
to talk to sometimes.

405
00:18:48,854 --> 00:18:50,323
I'm gonna go wash my hands.

406
00:18:55,828 --> 00:18:58,730
(tense jazz music)

407
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:33,132
(kids whispering)

408
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:38,237
Yo, you should pick that up.

409
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:41,340
Bananas are so good
(mock moaning).

410
00:19:42,674 --> 00:19:47,079
Justin Weingarter, you're
always such a douche bag.

411
00:19:52,918 --> 00:19:53,752
Hey.

412
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:59,291
I'm so sorry, I had no idea.

413
00:19:59,325 --> 00:20:00,926
He said he was just teasing you.

414
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:06,531
I'm gonna kill him.

415
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:13,272
He's not as tough as he
says he is, believe me.

416
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:21,013
Hey, wait do you think
that he's the one

417
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:23,382
that sent the video around
like from his phone?

418
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,622
I'll find out what's up.

419
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:34,793
(soft tense music)

420
00:21:02,455 --> 00:21:04,990
You really think Clay
will listen to her?

421
00:21:05,024 --> 00:21:07,259
You think there's something
going on with them?

422
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:08,160
Mister YouTube.

423
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:12,398
Hey come on, give us some
of those tears, Oscar...

424
00:21:12,431 --> 00:21:13,532
All right, assholes.

425
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,141
Clay, dude, dude.

426
00:21:22,174 --> 00:21:23,843
Awesome, how 'bout after school

427
00:21:23,876 --> 00:21:25,777
make this baby cry
some more, huh?

428
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,712
Nah, man, I'm done
with that kid.

429
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,915
Dude, fun's just getting
started, come on.

430
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:31,150
Kid took a beating.

431
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:34,053
He's a little ass dude but him
and his friends stood tall.

432
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,127
How much of a beating you
think you'd take, Justin?

433
00:21:41,994 --> 00:21:43,162
Spit out the tater tot.

434
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:53,705
Leave the kids alone.

435
00:22:07,453 --> 00:22:10,956
(soft tense music)

436
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,258
Why aren't you texting me back?

437
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,192
'Cause you were away.

438
00:22:13,225 --> 00:22:14,026
'Cause I was away?

439
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:14,860
I'm playing basketball.

440
00:22:14,894 --> 00:22:16,295
Nothing happened!

441
00:22:16,328 --> 00:22:17,129
What happened with you and Clay?

442
00:22:17,163 --> 00:22:18,030
Nothing happened.
Be honest.

443
00:22:18,063 --> 00:22:19,465
What do you mean nothing?

444
00:22:19,498 --> 00:22:20,633
Why do I keep hearing his name?

445
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:21,634
Okay, okay, fine.
Were you with him?

446
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:24,036
- Fine, yes.
- What?

447
00:22:24,069 --> 00:22:26,105
How could you do that?

448
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:29,074
(soft tense music)

449
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,914
I'm just terrified
to see him again...

450
00:22:34,947 --> 00:22:35,780
Cassie.

451
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:38,716
Marcus, hey.

452
00:22:40,685 --> 00:22:41,719
I'll just be a sec.

453
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:45,591
Hey, you wanted me to check
your work for the test?

454
00:22:45,624 --> 00:22:48,093
Oh yeah, thank you so much.

455
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,698
I should, I should go.

456
00:22:53,731 --> 00:22:56,502
Cassie, are you okay?

457
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:01,574
I saw you and Bryan
and are you okay?

458
00:23:04,776 --> 00:23:08,380
Whatever you said
to Clay it worked.

459
00:23:08,414 --> 00:23:10,249
What happened, what
did he say to you?

460
00:23:10,282 --> 00:23:11,783
Marcus.

461
00:23:11,816 --> 00:23:14,386
He just, these kids
were picking on me

462
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,821
and he told them to
back off and they did.

463
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:21,860
Listen, be careful
with him, okay?

464
00:23:21,894 --> 00:23:26,065
I trusted him and then I
found out that I shouldn't.

465
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,301
Found things that he
was hiding from me.

466
00:23:30,135 --> 00:23:33,405
Just watch your back, okay?

467
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,674
Cassie.

468
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:36,542
Oh my god.

469
00:23:38,743 --> 00:23:41,513
(kids clamoring)

470
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,590
(tense music)

471
00:23:51,624 --> 00:23:53,459
- Get him.
- Yeah.

472
00:23:53,492 --> 00:23:56,228
(kids clamoring)

473
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:17,616
Come on!

474
00:24:18,816 --> 00:24:19,985
Let's go.

475
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:22,787
(kids clamoring)

476
00:24:24,189 --> 00:24:26,258
Oh my god.

477
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:27,259
Out of the way, out of the way.

478
00:24:27,293 --> 00:24:29,295
Get out of the way.

479
00:24:29,328 --> 00:24:30,663
Oh my god.

480
00:24:30,696 --> 00:24:33,899
(kids clamoring)

481
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:36,435
(tense music)

482
00:24:46,045 --> 00:24:47,079
Did you see what happened?

483
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:49,915
Yeah, did you see
what Cassie did after?

484
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:52,785
(kids whispering)

485
00:24:56,989 --> 00:24:59,491
(tense music)

486
00:25:34,226 --> 00:25:36,729
(tense music)

487
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,901
(sirens wailing)

488
00:26:06,425 --> 00:26:09,194
(sirens wailing)

489
00:26:24,143 --> 00:26:26,779
(phone buzzing)

490
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,693
Oh, hey.

491
00:26:43,295 --> 00:26:47,132
Good morning, hi my
girl, hi my girl, yes.

492
00:27:02,147 --> 00:27:03,649
Up early.

493
00:27:03,682 --> 00:27:05,818
Given you don't need
to be at school today.

494
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:08,454
How are those
college apps going?

495
00:27:10,556 --> 00:27:11,390
Prodigious.

496
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:14,660
That's an SAT word.

497
00:27:19,164 --> 00:27:20,732
I'm going out.

498
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:22,968
I think maybe you
should stay in,

499
00:27:23,001 --> 00:27:26,405
use this unfortunate incident
to think about your future.

500
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:27,806
I'm good, thanks.

501
00:27:29,575 --> 00:27:30,409
Hey.

502
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,344
Hey!

503
00:27:33,212 --> 00:27:34,613
I meant what I said last night.

504
00:27:34,646 --> 00:27:35,714
You don't get into
college you're not

505
00:27:35,747 --> 00:27:36,950
gonna live here anymore.

506
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,619
So, mister SAT word, what
are you gonna do then?

507
00:27:42,187 --> 00:27:43,589
I'm gonna be fine.

508
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:47,192
You had your way, I've got mine.

509
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:52,164
I didn't walk the dog.

510
00:27:52,197 --> 00:27:55,133
(soft tense music)

511
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,520
Hey, it's Cassie,
leave a message.

512
00:28:14,553 --> 00:28:17,489
(soft tense music)

513
00:28:32,738 --> 00:28:35,407
(bells tolling)

514
00:29:23,522 --> 00:29:24,323
For what?

515
00:29:24,356 --> 00:29:26,258
These fools are 100 grand a day.

516
00:29:26,291 --> 00:29:27,860
To sit at a fucking
desk all day,

517
00:29:27,894 --> 00:29:29,595
pay that shit off in 10 years?

518
00:29:29,628 --> 00:29:30,830
That's chump shit, man.

519
00:29:30,863 --> 00:29:34,199
We're gonna be making 100
grand, 100 grand next year,

520
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:35,167
you feel me?

521
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,971
(gun cocks)

522
00:29:38,004 --> 00:29:40,272
(gunshots)

523
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:45,677
(clapping)

524
00:29:45,711 --> 00:29:47,112
Nice shooting, tex.

525
00:29:51,884 --> 00:29:52,718
So.

526
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,788
How come you didn't
ask for no re-up?

527
00:29:56,822 --> 00:29:58,024
I will when I need it.

528
00:29:59,658 --> 00:30:01,426
Is that what you
want me to tell Will?

529
00:30:04,097 --> 00:30:05,364
You know what he's been to you?

530
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:10,402
Kind and Will aint
known for being kind.

531
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:13,438
He gave you muscle,
took all this territory

532
00:30:13,472 --> 00:30:14,539
for you to push our shit.

533
00:30:14,573 --> 00:30:16,208
'Cause your pretty
ass looks right

534
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:18,377
walking up them
big county lawns.

535
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,278
Is that what
happened to Darnell?

536
00:30:23,482 --> 00:30:25,784
I'ma forget you said that

537
00:30:25,817 --> 00:30:28,453
and you gave you
product, good product,

538
00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:30,489
for you to sell.

539
00:30:32,658 --> 00:30:35,394
Yeah, we are selling
it, all right?

540
00:30:35,427 --> 00:30:36,261
All of it.

541
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:38,296
Sell more.

542
00:30:39,531 --> 00:30:41,968
You asked for this
deal, remember?

543
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,208
Here's the thing
about stepping up.

544
00:30:51,144 --> 00:30:52,945
You could say you're gonna,

545
00:30:52,979 --> 00:30:54,680
you could think you're gonna.

546
00:30:54,713 --> 00:30:56,949
Only part that
matters is the doing.

547
00:30:56,983 --> 00:30:59,152
You do, we're
gonna be all right.

548
00:30:59,184 --> 00:31:00,019
You don't.

549
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:06,025
Big man wants to see you later.

550
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,261
Yeah, for what?

551
00:31:09,294 --> 00:31:10,129
You'll see.

552
00:31:11,296 --> 00:31:13,833
Well lookie here, lookie here.

553
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,371
Who's bike is this?

554
00:31:22,175 --> 00:31:23,475
Okay.

555
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:25,144
Nephew birthday coming.

556
00:31:29,614 --> 00:31:32,451
(low tense music)

557
00:31:58,978 --> 00:32:00,146
Rough night?

558
00:32:01,413 --> 00:32:02,280
What do you want, man?

559
00:32:02,314 --> 00:32:03,682
We shouldn't meet
in public like this.

560
00:32:05,617 --> 00:32:07,319
Cassie's missing.

561
00:32:07,352 --> 00:32:08,720
She didn't come home last night.

562
00:32:08,754 --> 00:32:09,721
I thought you might
know something.

563
00:32:09,755 --> 00:32:10,555
Where were you?

564
00:32:10,589 --> 00:32:11,790
What do you mean missing?

565
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:15,194
All right, give me your
license and your registration

566
00:32:15,228 --> 00:32:17,230
in case somebody's looking.

567
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:21,600
Is she in trouble?

568
00:32:23,836 --> 00:32:25,403
I just don't know where she is.

569
00:32:25,437 --> 00:32:27,106
The captains on it, they
brought that boyfriend

570
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:27,940
of hers in for questioning.

571
00:32:27,974 --> 00:32:30,375
Oh what and I'm next, Officer?

572
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,312
You don't want me
in that room, man.

573
00:32:34,346 --> 00:32:35,647
They start asking questions,

574
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,449
you know where they're gonna go.

575
00:32:37,482 --> 00:32:38,416
Is that a threat?

576
00:32:40,052 --> 00:32:41,220
Where do they think she is?

577
00:32:41,254 --> 00:32:42,654
You don't get to
ask the questions...

578
00:32:42,687 --> 00:32:43,488
And you don't get
to play cop with me.

579
00:32:43,522 --> 00:32:45,323
I could snap you
like a fucking twig.

580
00:32:45,357 --> 00:32:46,525
It's a good thing
I'm not a twig.

581
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:48,426
Jesus, you think that I
don't have enough problems

582
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,295
at the department without
you crawling up my ass?

583
00:32:50,328 --> 00:32:52,198
You know who I work for, man.

584
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:53,132
All right?

585
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:54,800
You know how this works.

586
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:56,035
You know my man
in the city, Will,

587
00:32:56,068 --> 00:32:57,970
has a copy of that
sealed testimony,

588
00:32:58,004 --> 00:32:58,804
knows what really
happened between you

589
00:32:58,838 --> 00:33:00,639
and that kid a few years back.

590
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,507
How the PD covered that shit up,

591
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:04,743
paid off the parents, kept
it from going to trial.

592
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:06,745
So if you want to keep
that shit out of the papers

593
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:09,748
and keep that shiny little
badge, you give me information.

594
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:11,650
That's how it works, that's
how it's always worked.

595
00:33:11,683 --> 00:33:13,953
I told you that I would
give you information

596
00:33:13,986 --> 00:33:16,022
about local drug dealers.

597
00:33:16,055 --> 00:33:18,590
This shit is not
part of our deal.

598
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:19,491
It is now.

599
00:33:22,195 --> 00:33:24,964
Tell me what you know.

600
00:33:26,032 --> 00:33:28,533
Look at me, I got busted
back to a patrol car.

601
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:29,768
They don't even let me
in the room anymore.

602
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:30,837
Get back in the room.

603
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,971
Oh, okay.

604
00:33:32,004 --> 00:33:34,941
Find out everything they
know or I'm making the call.

605
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,052
This one, you can really
see her, her face.

606
00:33:48,054 --> 00:33:51,623
This one, it's, that's what
she really looks like now.

607
00:33:52,591 --> 00:33:54,927
Can you use all three?

608
00:33:54,961 --> 00:33:55,895
Sure.

609
00:33:55,928 --> 00:33:57,263
Jeanie, that's a good idea.

610
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:00,233
Do I get them back?

611
00:34:00,266 --> 00:34:01,366
Of course.

612
00:34:05,804 --> 00:34:06,605
Good to see you.

613
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:07,940
- Hey.
- Hey.

614
00:34:07,974 --> 00:34:09,842
I drove Cassie's parents here.

615
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:11,409
Nobody will tell me anything.

616
00:34:11,443 --> 00:34:12,245
What have you heard?

617
00:34:12,278 --> 00:34:13,478
Nothing new.

618
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:15,081
Uh, hey.

619
00:34:15,114 --> 00:34:19,018
I didn't tell anyone about
what happened at the party.

620
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,720
Yeah, good don't.

621
00:34:23,555 --> 00:34:26,893
Can I get my phone call already?

622
00:34:32,031 --> 00:34:33,199
- Sergeant.
- Ma'am.

623
00:34:35,201 --> 00:34:36,168
They found you.

624
00:34:36,202 --> 00:34:38,770
Yeah, I was out on route
40, out of radio range.

625
00:34:39,638 --> 00:34:42,141
I need someone to canvas
Cassie's neighborhood.

626
00:34:42,174 --> 00:34:43,142
Canvas?

627
00:34:43,175 --> 00:34:43,976
Any uniform can do that.

628
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:44,977
Yeah, shoe fits.

629
00:34:45,912 --> 00:34:48,114
Ma'am, Captain, Katherine.

630
00:34:52,651 --> 00:34:53,485
Let me help.

631
00:34:56,155 --> 00:34:58,024
I know you don't
trust me, all right,

632
00:34:58,057 --> 00:35:01,060
but I chose this job
to do good, I did,

633
00:35:01,093 --> 00:35:03,863
it's just most days
job aint about that.

634
00:35:06,332 --> 00:35:07,699
Let me help.

635
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:09,634
Colonel's still looking
for a place to put you.

636
00:35:09,668 --> 00:35:10,535
I don't know how
long you'll be here.

637
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:11,770
Well, I'm here now.

638
00:35:11,803 --> 00:35:14,773
So if I'm here in this

639
00:35:14,806 --> 00:35:17,944
and I'm not out there doing
what any first year could do.

640
00:35:17,977 --> 00:35:19,412
I'm the best in the room.

641
00:35:19,444 --> 00:35:20,512
Even you know that.

642
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:28,586
You can be good
police on this one?

643
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,523
Yes, that's what
I signed up for.

644
00:35:31,556 --> 00:35:33,059
I signed up for the pension.

645
00:35:36,862 --> 00:35:38,763
When was the last
time you saw Cassie?

646
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:42,567
You gotta think about that one?

647
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,436
No I...

648
00:35:45,037 --> 00:35:45,838
Why?

649
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:47,605
Just answer the question.

650
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:49,041
Yesterday at school.

651
00:35:49,075 --> 00:35:51,377
Yesterday got exciting,
I hear Clay Howard...

652
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,244
He's a dick.

653
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:55,314
We had a disagreement.

654
00:35:55,348 --> 00:35:56,648
We're gonna need more than that.

655
00:35:56,681 --> 00:35:58,117
Is this about him?

656
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,051
Figures.

657
00:35:59,085 --> 00:36:01,420
I told you, he's a dick.

658
00:36:01,454 --> 00:36:02,554
Answer her question.

659
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,093
It was about Cassie.

660
00:36:07,126 --> 00:36:08,928
She's your girlfriend, right?

661
00:36:10,363 --> 00:36:11,796
She was.

662
00:36:11,831 --> 00:36:13,165
Was?

663
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:15,533
Did that dick have
something to do with that?

664
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,070
That must have pissed you off.

665
00:36:18,104 --> 00:36:20,439
When was the last time
you saw Cassie, exactly?

666
00:36:21,506 --> 00:36:22,441
At school at the fight.

667
00:36:22,475 --> 00:36:24,310
You talk to her after that?

668
00:36:24,343 --> 00:36:26,345
I texted her, she
didn't text back.

669
00:36:26,379 --> 00:36:28,114
Where were you last night?

670
00:36:28,147 --> 00:36:29,382
Out.
Out?

671
00:36:29,415 --> 00:36:31,816
Yeah, went out for a drive.

672
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:34,519
All night?

673
00:36:34,552 --> 00:36:36,188
Y'all know how much
longer this gonna be?

674
00:36:36,222 --> 00:36:38,324
I got a game tonight.

675
00:36:38,357 --> 00:36:39,425
I think the warriors
are gonna have

676
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,394
to do without tonight, Bryan.

677
00:36:42,627 --> 00:36:43,429
(knocking)

678
00:36:43,462 --> 00:36:44,263
Yeah?

679
00:36:44,296 --> 00:36:45,630
We got something.

680
00:36:45,663 --> 00:36:50,668
(soft tense music)
(indistinct radio chatter)

681
00:36:53,805 --> 00:36:55,408
Long night, you get any sleep?

682
00:36:55,441 --> 00:36:56,409
Not bad.

683
00:36:56,442 --> 00:36:57,776
My husband got that
snore strap, so.

684
00:36:57,809 --> 00:36:58,844
I didn't know they worked.

685
00:36:58,878 --> 00:36:59,879
Yeah.

686
00:36:59,912 --> 00:37:00,779
All right, so we
got a 2006 Sonata,

687
00:37:00,812 --> 00:37:02,882
it's registered
to Aaron Williams.

688
00:37:04,316 --> 00:37:05,683
Recover anything?

689
00:37:05,717 --> 00:37:06,952
Odds and ends.

690
00:37:06,986 --> 00:37:10,456
Receipts, non recent, some old
workout clothes in the trunk.

691
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:11,290
Prints?

692
00:37:11,323 --> 00:37:12,358
Dusting.

693
00:37:12,391 --> 00:37:13,758
No prints on the steering wheel.

694
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:15,027
It looks like it's
been wiped clean.

695
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:15,895
Intentionally?

696
00:37:19,597 --> 00:37:21,233
Why the hell would
she come out here?

697
00:37:22,468 --> 00:37:23,269
Come on.

698
00:37:23,302 --> 00:37:24,103
It's cold.

699
00:37:24,136 --> 00:37:25,570
It's like 80 degrees out.

700
00:37:25,603 --> 00:37:26,805
I don't have a swimsuit.

701
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:27,772
So?

702
00:37:29,308 --> 00:37:31,477
(laughing)

703
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,511
I'm going in.

704
00:37:32,545 --> 00:37:34,813
Go ahead, prep school.

705
00:37:34,847 --> 00:37:37,283
(laughing)

706
00:37:37,316 --> 00:37:38,583
Holly!

707
00:37:38,616 --> 00:37:40,853
(shouting)

708
00:37:45,824 --> 00:37:46,859
Dudes!

709
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:47,927
Baltimore.

710
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,295
We are on the scene.

711
00:37:49,328 --> 00:37:50,129
Come on, what is it?

712
00:37:50,162 --> 00:37:51,530
My god.

713
00:37:51,564 --> 00:37:52,531
That's Cassie's car.

714
00:37:52,565 --> 00:37:54,133
What if something
did happen to her?

715
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,568
Why would something
of happened to her?

716
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,903
A lot has been going
on the past few days.

717
00:37:57,937 --> 00:37:58,904
Like what?

718
00:37:58,938 --> 00:38:00,239
Well, if you actually
talked to your friends

719
00:38:00,272 --> 00:38:02,174
when you were off from your
fancy country club school

720
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:04,110
you'd know, wouldn't you?

721
00:38:04,143 --> 00:38:07,980
For now, channel
seven signing off.

722
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:29,301
Did you find her?

723
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:34,173
Hey, scooch.

724
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:36,808
I'm fine.

725
00:38:36,842 --> 00:38:38,710
You're not.

726
00:38:38,743 --> 00:38:39,545
It's okay.

727
00:38:39,578 --> 00:38:43,916
It's okay to be not
fine, sometimes.

728
00:38:45,217 --> 00:38:46,318
You're always fine.

729
00:38:49,488 --> 00:38:50,322
I'm not.

730
00:38:52,591 --> 00:38:55,828
Sometimes I think I don't even
want to do this job anymore.

731
00:38:55,861 --> 00:38:56,728
Yeah, you do.

732
00:38:58,497 --> 00:39:00,399
I didn't always.

733
00:39:00,432 --> 00:39:02,800
I was gonna be a teacher.

734
00:39:02,835 --> 00:39:04,503
Then you came along.

735
00:39:08,673 --> 00:39:10,808
We didn't want to tell you

736
00:39:10,843 --> 00:39:12,278
and we were hoping that you,

737
00:39:14,246 --> 00:39:15,881
that you wouldn't remember

738
00:39:16,882 --> 00:39:20,818
but when you were little

739
00:39:22,588 --> 00:39:23,889
I was getting groceries.

740
00:39:24,722 --> 00:39:28,427
I had finished loading
the car and I had you

741
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,996
in your car seat and
your pink bunny blanket

742
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,065
wrapped up like a
burrito with legs.

743
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:36,902
Just your little
face peeking out.

744
00:39:36,936 --> 00:39:40,639
I went around to the
driver side and I,

745
00:39:40,673 --> 00:39:43,509
I got in and I started to
put my key in the ignition

746
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:45,978
and a man opened the door.

747
00:39:46,946 --> 00:39:50,683
I looked down and he had a knife

748
00:39:51,716 --> 00:39:53,751
and he said, "Drive."

749
00:39:55,221 --> 00:39:58,357
So, I drove.

750
00:40:00,326 --> 00:40:01,694
I looked in the rear view mirror

751
00:40:01,726 --> 00:40:04,463
and I had the mirror set
up so I that I could,

752
00:40:05,763 --> 00:40:10,768
I could see your face and
you were just smiling at me.

753
00:40:13,805 --> 00:40:16,609
We got to a red light

754
00:40:16,642 --> 00:40:20,312
and this man looks out the
window just for a second

755
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:26,185
and I see a patrol
car on the other side

756
00:40:27,419 --> 00:40:29,488
and he hasn't seen it yet

757
00:40:31,523 --> 00:40:35,760
and suddenly I take
his head and I,

758
00:40:37,029 --> 00:40:39,565
I slam it into the dashboard.

759
00:40:39,598 --> 00:40:44,603
I've never done anything
like that before, ever,

760
00:40:45,604 --> 00:40:48,607
and he, he slashed
at me with the knife,

761
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:52,845
I put my arms up
and he cuts my arm,

762
00:40:52,878 --> 00:40:54,280
there's blood everywhere

763
00:40:54,313 --> 00:40:56,315
and I unbuckled you faster

764
00:40:56,348 --> 00:40:58,350
than I have ever
unbuckled you before

765
00:40:58,384 --> 00:40:59,718
and I had you in my arms

766
00:40:59,752 --> 00:41:00,785
and he grabbed for you

767
00:41:00,818 --> 00:41:03,788
and I pulled him away
from you so hard.

768
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:07,092
I ran so hard towards
that patrol car

769
00:41:07,126 --> 00:41:09,561
and there was blood
going down the blanket

770
00:41:09,595 --> 00:41:10,896
and the officers face went white

771
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:15,100
and I, I turned around

772
00:41:16,769 --> 00:41:19,972
and the guy was running, he
was running around the car

773
00:41:20,005 --> 00:41:22,941
to try and get away and
the other officer was there

774
00:41:24,076 --> 00:41:28,013
with her gun drawn and that
man kneeled in front of her

775
00:41:35,854 --> 00:41:39,958
and the other officer came
around and he cuffed him

776
00:41:45,164 --> 00:41:47,533
and I didn't want to
be a teacher anymore.

777
00:41:50,536 --> 00:41:53,372
I've been on this
job for 17 years

778
00:41:56,742 --> 00:42:01,113
and bad things are still
happening in this town

779
00:42:01,146 --> 00:42:02,581
and I...

780
00:42:02,614 --> 00:42:05,217
(somber music)

781
00:42:06,652 --> 00:42:09,154
And I can't stop them.

782
00:42:09,188 --> 00:42:12,691
(somber reflective music)

783
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:33,312
Give me the damn phone!

784
00:42:33,345 --> 00:42:35,047
Oh my god, are you serious?

785
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,081
You don't want me
to come over there

786
00:42:36,115 --> 00:42:36,915
and take it from you.

787
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:37,783
It's getting worse.

788
00:42:38,984 --> 00:42:40,486
You can stay at my house.

789
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:41,887
I'll talk to my mom,
she'll be cool with it.

790
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,755
I'll be fine.

791
00:42:44,656 --> 00:42:48,227
Marcus, you have to tell
someone what you saw.

792
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,662
The cops, your mom, somebody.

793
00:42:53,465 --> 00:42:55,134
What if Clay finds out?

794
00:42:56,301 --> 00:42:58,570
The guys still have my bike.

795
00:42:58,604 --> 00:43:01,073
What if she's out there?

796
00:43:01,106 --> 00:43:02,374
You can help find her.

797
00:43:05,177 --> 00:43:06,211
Just 'cause it's the hard thing

798
00:43:06,245 --> 00:43:08,147
doesn't mean it's
not the right thing.

799
00:43:12,017 --> 00:43:12,852
Team Dork?

800
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,721
Team Dork.

801
00:43:22,194 --> 00:43:23,996
May I be excused?

802
00:43:24,029 --> 00:43:27,901
That is pizza from Scatinos.

803
00:43:27,933 --> 00:43:30,035
You had like two bites
and there isn't a piece

804
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:31,603
of broccoli on that thing.

805
00:43:31,637 --> 00:43:32,771
I'm not hungry.

806
00:43:32,805 --> 00:43:35,875
You may be excused when you
finish the food you took.

807
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:39,745
(sighing)

808
00:43:52,591 --> 00:43:53,725
May I be excused?

809
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:02,534
You do remember I gave birth
to you that time, right?

810
00:44:02,568 --> 00:44:03,903
What?

811
00:44:03,937 --> 00:44:05,304
You come home from
school the first day

812
00:44:05,337 --> 00:44:08,640
with cuts on your face, tell
me you fell playing soccer

813
00:44:08,674 --> 00:44:09,608
and you don't even play soccer.

814
00:44:09,641 --> 00:44:11,043
I do sometimes.
Then you come home tonight

815
00:44:11,076 --> 00:44:13,979
and won't say two words
and boy I am trying

816
00:44:14,012 --> 00:44:15,247
to let you do your
thing your way

817
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,250
but if something is wrong,
you gotta talk to me.

818
00:44:18,283 --> 00:44:19,218
Nothing is wrong.

819
00:44:19,251 --> 00:44:20,920
I am not stupid.

820
00:44:20,954 --> 00:44:22,054
I finished my food.

821
00:44:22,087 --> 00:44:22,889
Why won't you just let me go?

822
00:44:22,922 --> 00:44:23,989
Whatever you are dealing with,

823
00:44:24,022 --> 00:44:25,757
you don't have to
do it on your own.

824
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:26,758
You're just a kid.

825
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:28,895
I may be just a kid but
I'm not stupid, either.

826
00:44:28,928 --> 00:44:29,728
I didn't say that.

827
00:44:29,761 --> 00:44:30,696
I understand shit.

828
00:44:30,729 --> 00:44:31,663
Language.

829
00:44:31,697 --> 00:44:32,798
I have to understand.

830
00:44:32,832 --> 00:44:34,266
If I'm just a kid than
how come I take care

831
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:35,634
of myself all the damn time?

832
00:44:35,667 --> 00:44:37,369
Oh you take care of yourself?

833
00:44:37,402 --> 00:44:38,872
Yeah, 'cause you're never here.

834
00:44:38,905 --> 00:44:40,339
Because I am out
making the money

835
00:44:40,372 --> 00:44:41,607
that puts the food on the table.

836
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,008
You grabbing your
lunch out of the fridge

837
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:44,911
in the morning is not you
taking care of yourself.

838
00:44:44,944 --> 00:44:46,778
I'm on my own at that school.

839
00:44:46,812 --> 00:44:49,047
I'm the one that has to
survive there for four years.

840
00:44:49,081 --> 00:44:49,883
Me not you.

841
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:51,817
You do not have
to be on your own.

842
00:44:51,851 --> 00:44:52,919
I am trying to help you.

843
00:44:52,952 --> 00:44:54,319
Maybe I don't want your help.

844
00:44:54,353 --> 00:44:56,822
It is my job to help
you, I am your mama.

845
00:44:56,856 --> 00:44:58,457
Maybe I don't want a mama.

846
00:45:17,042 --> 00:45:18,477
You're excused.

847
00:45:19,511 --> 00:45:21,113
That thing you said about dad,

848
00:45:22,882 --> 00:45:24,884
I think about it for
you, too sometimes.

849
00:45:26,585 --> 00:45:28,453
Maybe if he was
still around you'd...

850
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:32,992
Marcus.

851
00:45:33,026 --> 00:45:34,192
I know, I wasn't really supposed

852
00:45:34,226 --> 00:45:37,162
to happen when I did and maybe
you'd have a better life...

853
00:45:37,195 --> 00:45:39,698
Marcus, that is not what this...

854
00:45:39,731 --> 00:45:41,767
Don't lie about it with me.

855
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,068
Just tell me the truth.

856
00:45:43,101 --> 00:45:44,403
I'm not a kid anymore.

857
00:45:44,436 --> 00:45:46,138
I'm not stupid.

858
00:45:57,282 --> 00:45:59,351
No, you are not stupid.

859
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,189
You are so smart, I don't
even know where it comes from.

860
00:46:06,893 --> 00:46:08,594
But you don't know
everything yet.

861
00:46:09,862 --> 00:46:12,097
Relationships aren't
a solid thing.

862
00:46:13,265 --> 00:46:16,869
They get tested, they bend,

863
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:19,471
then you see if they break

864
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:24,142
and if you haven't used too much

865
00:46:24,176 --> 00:46:28,413
that is because the raw
material was not strong enough.

866
00:46:29,748 --> 00:46:33,385
Your daddy, he said
a lot of things.

867
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:41,894
But a man is not what he says.

868
00:46:44,162 --> 00:46:45,263
He's what he does.

869
00:46:47,934 --> 00:46:50,502
Your daddy wasn't
ready for doing.

870
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:55,975
Now tell me,

871
00:46:57,376 --> 00:46:59,444
what the hell is
going on with you?

872
00:47:04,683 --> 00:47:05,817
Marcus.

873
00:47:10,089 --> 00:47:12,157
Good evening, I am
Captain Katherine Hilman

874
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:14,526
with the Baltimore County
Police Department's

875
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:16,762
Criminal Investigative Division.

876
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:19,431
Yesterday, at
approximately 8:16 PM,

877
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:20,867
Cassandra "Cassie" Williams

878
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,802
was reported missing by her
mother, Jeanie Williams.

879
00:47:23,836 --> 00:47:25,838
Cassie was last seen
yesterday about three PM,

880
00:47:25,872 --> 00:47:28,740
by her boyfriend, Bryan Santini.

881
00:47:28,774 --> 00:47:32,210
Today, a car owned by Aaron
Williams, Cassie's father,

882
00:47:32,244 --> 00:47:34,914
was discovered in a
parking lot off route 40.

883
00:47:34,947 --> 00:47:36,381
Holly, answer your damn phone.

884
00:47:36,415 --> 00:47:38,750
Searches of the area
are being conducted.

885
00:47:38,784 --> 00:47:42,521
At this time, Cassie is
considered a missing person.

886
00:47:42,554 --> 00:47:44,189
We will continue
to conduct searches

887
00:47:44,222 --> 00:47:45,992
and follow all leads
as they come...

888
00:47:46,025 --> 00:47:48,828
(soft tense music)

889
00:47:48,861 --> 00:47:50,395
Clay!

890
00:47:50,429 --> 00:47:51,898
We are reconstructing a timeline

891
00:47:51,931 --> 00:47:53,732
of Cassie's whereabouts
in the 24 hours

892
00:47:53,765 --> 00:47:54,867
before she disappeared.

893
00:47:54,901 --> 00:47:55,868
Go.

894
00:47:55,902 --> 00:47:57,170
If you have any
information whatsoever

895
00:47:57,202 --> 00:47:59,404
or saw her in the last 24 hours,

896
00:47:59,438 --> 00:48:01,440
please contact our tip line,

897
00:48:01,473 --> 00:48:04,977
no matter how minute
or small it may seem.

898
00:48:07,013 --> 00:48:10,315
We will follow up on
every lead and tip.

899
00:48:10,348 --> 00:48:13,285
(soft tense music)

900
00:48:18,757 --> 00:48:20,392
(phone ringing)

901
00:48:20,425 --> 00:48:21,693
Baltimore County Police.

902
00:48:21,727 --> 00:48:24,496
Hi, I have information
on that missing girl.

903
00:48:27,365 --> 00:48:28,300
Go ahead.

904
00:48:31,104 --> 00:48:33,338
(knocking)

905
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:37,809
I threw rocks.

906
00:48:37,844 --> 00:48:39,578
Why didn't you say
something or text?

907
00:48:39,611 --> 00:48:40,746
I did text.

908
00:48:42,148 --> 00:48:43,348
Oh.

909
00:48:43,381 --> 00:48:44,884
Could you help me, please?

910
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:49,321
Oh shit, sorry.

911
00:48:49,354 --> 00:48:51,623
It's okay, mom's
on the night shift.

912
00:48:53,926 --> 00:48:56,028
You okay?

913
00:48:56,062 --> 00:48:58,197
I want to go to Fort Invincible.

914
00:48:58,231 --> 00:49:01,566
(soft reflective music)

915
00:49:29,795 --> 00:49:30,762
Do you need help?

916
00:49:30,796 --> 00:49:31,864
I got it, got it.

917
00:49:31,898 --> 00:49:34,200
There you go.

918
00:49:34,233 --> 00:49:37,536
(soft reflective music)

919
00:49:41,007 --> 00:49:42,440
Having fun there?

920
00:49:43,575 --> 00:49:44,743
He's pissed.

921
00:49:47,612 --> 00:49:48,713
What happened?

922
00:49:48,747 --> 00:49:52,185
He was all pissed because
he'd been calling me

923
00:49:52,218 --> 00:49:54,386
and I'd been ignoring him.

924
00:49:55,687 --> 00:49:57,422
He said with
everything going on,

925
00:49:57,455 --> 00:49:59,591
he don't want me
going out at all.

926
00:50:00,893 --> 00:50:02,295
It aint safe.

927
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:05,965
And I was like, I
can't be locked in here

928
00:50:05,998 --> 00:50:08,500
with you two fighting, no way.

929
00:50:10,368 --> 00:50:11,304
He flipped out.

930
00:50:12,337 --> 00:50:16,474
Threw a lamp at the
wall, sent me to my room.

931
00:50:16,508 --> 00:50:19,879
I got out of that window
as fast as I could.

932
00:50:19,912 --> 00:50:22,114
They're so messed up.

933
00:50:22,148 --> 00:50:25,218
It's like, I don't
even got a family.

934
00:50:29,922 --> 00:50:30,990
But you do.

935
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:33,458
You've got me.

936
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,830
You know I love you, right?

937
00:50:39,497 --> 00:50:40,665
You love me?

938
00:50:42,201 --> 00:50:43,035
Yeah.

939
00:50:44,971 --> 00:50:46,705
What do you mean?

940
00:50:46,738 --> 00:50:49,075
I mean, I mean I love you.

941
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:53,346
(soft reflective music)

942
00:51:23,175 --> 00:51:24,043
I'm gonna go pee.

943
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,054
You okay?

944
00:51:38,858 --> 00:51:40,492
You'll talk to
him but not to me?

945
00:51:40,525 --> 00:51:42,094
Well, he's been around.

946
00:51:42,128 --> 00:51:43,296
It's been like two days.

947
00:51:44,663 --> 00:51:45,998
I miss you guys.

948
00:51:46,032 --> 00:51:48,834
Then why didn't you
come to hell house?

949
00:51:48,868 --> 00:51:49,969
If you had come
maybe that wouldn't

950
00:51:50,002 --> 00:51:50,836
of happened to Marcus.

951
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:52,305
I didn't know that
was gonna happen.

952
00:51:52,338 --> 00:51:53,139
You said you would come.

953
00:51:53,172 --> 00:51:54,739
I said I might come.

954
00:51:54,773 --> 00:51:56,842
I met some kids at school,
we were hanging out.

955
00:51:56,876 --> 00:51:59,444
It's always about you,
you're so selfish.

956
00:51:59,477 --> 00:52:02,048
Just 'cause I have other
stuff going on in my life?

957
00:52:02,081 --> 00:52:03,049
Good stuff.

958
00:52:03,082 --> 00:52:04,984
That doesn't mean I'm
not still your friend.

959
00:52:05,017 --> 00:52:06,484
Well, a friend would
have been there.

960
00:52:09,754 --> 00:52:10,588
It's fine.

961
00:52:11,656 --> 00:52:13,159
Me and Marcus can deal.

962
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,194
We have each other.

963
00:52:18,364 --> 00:52:20,199
What does that mean?

964
00:52:21,267 --> 00:52:26,272
He said he loves me.

965
00:52:26,705 --> 00:52:29,075
He loves you?

966
00:52:29,108 --> 00:52:30,608
Loves you like how?

967
00:52:39,385 --> 00:52:40,685
I've always...

968
00:52:44,123 --> 00:52:45,690
What about Brandy Torgenson?

969
00:52:49,428 --> 00:52:50,963
Screw Brandy Torgenson.

970
00:52:58,971 --> 00:53:00,638
Shit.
No, wait, wait, wait.

971
00:53:00,672 --> 00:53:03,775
(upbeat tense music)

972
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,745
Marcus, wait.

973
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:18,024
Marcus!

974
00:53:38,543 --> 00:53:39,512
Marcus?

975
00:53:39,544 --> 00:53:42,448
Holly (shushes).

976
00:53:47,386 --> 00:53:49,422
Sorry about...
(shushes)

977
00:53:49,455 --> 00:53:52,724
(tense dramatic music)

978
00:54:17,149 --> 00:54:17,983
Goodbye.

979
00:54:20,186 --> 00:54:23,422
(tense dramatic music)

980
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:31,629
What are you guys looking at?

981
00:54:31,663 --> 00:54:33,466
(shushes) Get down.

982
00:54:33,499 --> 00:54:34,567
Clay, Clay.

983
00:54:35,968 --> 00:54:39,872
I heard something, there's
something out there.

984
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,942
Did you hear that?

985
00:55:07,765 --> 00:55:08,733
(twigs snapping)

986
00:55:08,766 --> 00:55:12,371
(energetic dramatic music)

987
00:56:02,754 --> 00:56:05,524
(sirens wailing)

988
00:56:11,997 --> 00:56:13,032
Hey.

989
00:56:13,065 --> 00:56:16,001
Got you guys some hot chocolate.

990
00:56:16,035 --> 00:56:19,004
Thought that this might
warm you up, there you go.

991
00:56:22,575 --> 00:56:26,811
So I heard that you, you
guys maybe saw something

992
00:56:26,845 --> 00:56:29,215
tonight that you didn't
want to see, is that right?

993
00:56:32,051 --> 00:56:34,920
Maybe you can tell
me about that?

994
00:56:36,922 --> 00:56:38,023
Hey.

995
00:56:38,057 --> 00:56:39,592
We were able to get ahold
of all of your parents

996
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:41,793
and they are on their way.

997
00:56:41,827 --> 00:56:43,462
If it's all right with
them, can you take us back

998
00:56:43,495 --> 00:56:44,396
to where you were?

999
00:56:45,898 --> 00:56:48,133
Okay, I have a file
on Clay Howard.

1000
00:56:48,167 --> 00:56:50,569
You said that he had a
relationship with Cassie?

1001
00:56:50,603 --> 00:56:52,605
I don't know, it
looked like that.

1002
00:56:52,638 --> 00:56:55,807
I mean, I said that on
the phone yesterday.

1003
00:56:55,841 --> 00:56:56,909
The phone?

1004
00:56:56,942 --> 00:56:59,211
I called and said I
had seen her the day

1005
00:56:59,245 --> 00:57:01,180
she disappeared at school.

1006
00:57:01,213 --> 00:57:02,715
You called here?

1007
00:57:02,747 --> 00:57:04,250
Yeah.

1008
00:57:04,283 --> 00:57:06,619
Do you remember
who you talked to?

1009
00:57:06,652 --> 00:57:07,886
Not sure.

1010
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,923
It was male or female,
man or a woman?

1011
00:57:10,956 --> 00:57:11,857
Male.

1012
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:13,025
That's good.

1013
00:57:13,058 --> 00:57:13,993
Can you please check that out?

1014
00:57:17,296 --> 00:57:19,764
You guys are doing great.

1015
00:57:19,797 --> 00:57:23,135
(somber dramatic music)

1016
00:58:15,154 --> 00:58:16,355
You son of a bitch.

1017
00:58:16,388 --> 00:58:17,356
You son of a bitch!

1018
00:58:17,389 --> 00:58:18,257
Holly.
No, no.

1019
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,291
You defend him?

1020
00:58:19,325 --> 00:58:20,392
Hey, you don't push your mother!

1021
00:58:20,426 --> 00:58:22,061
That's enough, that's enough.

1022
00:58:25,831 --> 00:58:27,766
Suns coming up, let's go.

1023
00:58:30,402 --> 00:58:31,236
After you.

1024
00:58:32,738 --> 00:58:33,639
We'll be right behind you.

1025
00:58:39,745 --> 00:58:40,579
Okay?

1026
00:58:42,081 --> 00:58:43,082
All right, let's go.

1027
00:58:45,517 --> 00:58:48,687
(soft dramatic music)

1028
00:59:27,793 --> 00:59:29,128
Here.

1029
00:59:29,161 --> 00:59:30,562
Thank you.

1030
00:59:30,596 --> 00:59:33,499
(soft tense music)

1031
00:59:57,857 --> 00:59:59,191
You mad at me?

1032
01:00:02,494 --> 01:00:03,695
I'm scared.

1033
01:00:05,531 --> 01:00:07,366
To think you were there,
so close to all that

1034
01:00:07,399 --> 01:00:08,801
and I had no idea.

1035
01:00:12,204 --> 01:00:13,772
Can't believe she's dead.

1036
01:00:23,649 --> 01:00:27,653
I can only imagine what
they're going through.

1037
01:00:34,059 --> 01:00:34,960
Looks like a kind
of contamination

1038
01:00:34,993 --> 01:00:37,396
but unfortunately
that is exactly

1039
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:38,797
what we're looking at right now.

1040
01:00:38,832 --> 01:00:40,065
Here, lab results from his car.

1041
01:00:40,098 --> 01:00:42,601
And the, some of the
dirt looks brushed over

1042
01:00:42,634 --> 01:00:44,736
which means someone was trying
to cover up their tracks,

1043
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:45,737
like literally.

1044
01:00:47,439 --> 01:00:49,341
Did you find out
who took that call?

1045
01:00:49,374 --> 01:00:50,976
No, there's no record of it.

1046
01:00:51,009 --> 01:00:53,245
You sure the kid called it in?

1047
01:00:53,278 --> 01:00:54,948
Why would he lie?

1048
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:55,915
Ask around.

1049
01:00:57,583 --> 01:00:59,384
What you find out about the car?

1050
01:00:59,418 --> 01:01:00,552
My guess is it's a small SUV...

1051
01:01:00,586 --> 01:01:03,522
(soft tense music)

1052
01:01:23,977 --> 01:01:26,111
All right, we got something.

1053
01:01:26,144 --> 01:01:28,480
Come on everybody, let's go.

1054
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,435
It smell like smoke to you?

1055
01:01:50,469 --> 01:01:51,670
Go see what you can see.

1056
01:01:56,241 --> 01:01:57,977
Hello, officers.

1057
01:01:58,011 --> 01:01:59,511
This is the captain.

1058
01:02:01,313 --> 01:02:02,147
Okay.

1059
01:02:03,115 --> 01:02:03,983
You Clay Howard?

1060
01:02:05,517 --> 01:02:06,986
Cleaning up?

1061
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:07,819
It's a shower, yeah.

1062
01:02:07,854 --> 01:02:08,687
At noon?

1063
01:02:09,621 --> 01:02:11,356
No school, two days suspension.

1064
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:13,191
Burning something
in the back there?

1065
01:02:14,459 --> 01:02:15,561
Just lunch.

1066
01:02:15,594 --> 01:02:16,963
Look, can I help you?

1067
01:02:16,996 --> 01:02:18,430
Get dressed.

1068
01:02:18,463 --> 01:02:19,765
We'll talk at the station.

1069
01:02:20,833 --> 01:02:21,667
No.

1070
01:02:27,907 --> 01:02:29,541
Excuse me?

1071
01:02:29,575 --> 01:02:31,677
I'm sorry but unless you're
arresting me for something

1072
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:33,612
I suggest you
speak to my lawyer.

1073
01:02:33,645 --> 01:02:34,446
You have a lawyer?

1074
01:02:34,479 --> 01:02:35,280
I will in an hour.

1075
01:02:36,481 --> 01:02:38,250
We're just trying
to help Cassie.

1076
01:02:39,151 --> 01:02:40,887
Don't you want to help her?

1077
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,121
Lady, I know my rights.

1078
01:02:43,155 --> 01:02:44,857
What's going on here?

1079
01:02:44,891 --> 01:02:46,025
Just a few questions.

1080
01:02:46,059 --> 01:02:47,693
Not without his lawyer
present you're not.

1081
01:02:47,726 --> 01:02:48,928
And that's you?

1082
01:02:48,962 --> 01:02:50,529
Someone from my firm.

1083
01:02:50,562 --> 01:02:51,898
What's this in reference to?

1084
01:02:51,931 --> 01:02:52,999
Cassie Williams.

1085
01:02:54,934 --> 01:02:57,235
That girl who disappeared?

1086
01:02:57,269 --> 01:02:58,503
Yeah.

1087
01:02:58,537 --> 01:03:01,807
Can you at least tell me where
he was the night before last?

1088
01:03:01,841 --> 01:03:03,342
That's easy, he was with me.

1089
01:03:04,443 --> 01:03:06,144
Anyone who could
corroborate that?

1090
01:03:06,178 --> 01:03:07,512
Call the number on the card.

1091
01:03:07,546 --> 01:03:08,380
Let's go.

1092
01:03:12,986 --> 01:03:14,988
No, it wasn't a dog.

1093
01:03:15,021 --> 01:03:17,522
You said the body was
wrapped in plastic.

1094
01:03:17,556 --> 01:03:18,790
What color?

1095
01:03:18,824 --> 01:03:21,493
Grayish, clearish,
like a shower liner.

1096
01:03:22,361 --> 01:03:25,797
And you said that what, you
were about 75 feet away?

1097
01:03:25,832 --> 01:03:27,799
Those headlights, that
was the only source

1098
01:03:27,834 --> 01:03:28,800
of illumination?

1099
01:03:28,835 --> 01:03:30,569
Why would anyone
bury a dog there?

1100
01:03:30,602 --> 01:03:32,704
Sometimes people are
looking for a pretty place,

1101
01:03:32,738 --> 01:03:34,806
sometimes they don't want
the body in the back yard.

1102
01:03:34,841 --> 01:03:37,509
The rangers tell me pet
graves are not uncommon.

1103
01:03:37,542 --> 01:03:39,344
Forensics is combing the site.

1104
01:03:39,378 --> 01:03:41,713
That will take a day
or two but right now

1105
01:03:41,747 --> 01:03:44,750
all we have tied to Cassie
is the car, nothing else.

1106
01:03:44,783 --> 01:03:47,120
She's still
categorized as missing.

1107
01:03:47,152 --> 01:03:49,821
We saw him, he was burying her.

1108
01:03:49,856 --> 01:03:50,789
He killed her.

1109
01:03:50,822 --> 01:03:52,824
You can't just let him
get away with that.

1110
01:03:52,859 --> 01:03:54,760
Right now I'm
looking for evidence.

1111
01:03:54,793 --> 01:03:56,896
I go where the
evidence takes me.

1112
01:03:56,929 --> 01:03:59,264
Look, we'll keep an eye on him.

1113
01:03:59,297 --> 01:04:00,732
I promise, okay?

1114
01:04:06,906 --> 01:04:08,941
I just got this.

1115
01:04:08,975 --> 01:04:12,177
Santini's ex girlfriend
filed a complaint

1116
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:14,379
against him last
year for assault.

1117
01:04:14,413 --> 01:04:17,449
But his parents got a
lawyer, so they settled it.

1118
01:04:17,482 --> 01:04:19,484
You see him doing it?

1119
01:04:19,518 --> 01:04:20,786
Clay Howard?

1120
01:04:23,588 --> 01:04:25,024
Maybe there's another option.

1121
01:04:25,058 --> 01:04:25,958
Yeah, what?

1122
01:04:25,992 --> 01:04:28,660
Well that steering
wheel was wiped clean

1123
01:04:28,694 --> 01:04:29,661
and the footprints
were brushed over.

1124
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:31,898
It was really thorough
for a high school kid.

1125
01:04:32,899 --> 01:04:36,768
That call that kid made,
what if it wasn't lost?

1126
01:04:36,802 --> 01:04:39,839
What if it wasn't
logged in on purpose?

1127
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:43,375
Hmm.

1128
01:04:45,777 --> 01:04:46,745
Like a cop?

1129
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:49,214
Well.

1130
01:04:49,247 --> 01:04:52,151
(soft tense music)

1131
01:04:55,687 --> 01:04:57,355
What if we're wrong?

1132
01:04:57,389 --> 01:04:58,858
I know what I saw.

1133
01:04:58,891 --> 01:05:01,226
It be easier if we
didn't see it but we did.

1134
01:05:01,259 --> 01:05:03,462
Then why did the
cops find a dog?

1135
01:05:03,495 --> 01:05:06,199
Maybe Clay knew we
went to the police,

1136
01:05:06,231 --> 01:05:07,799
so they moved the body
but they needed something

1137
01:05:07,834 --> 01:05:10,002
to put in that hole to
explain what we saw.

1138
01:05:10,837 --> 01:05:14,806
But how did they know
we went to the police?

1139
01:05:14,841 --> 01:05:17,143
I mean, come on.

1140
01:05:17,176 --> 01:05:18,510
What can we do?

1141
01:05:20,312 --> 01:05:22,882
I'm told all the
time what I can't do,

1142
01:05:22,915 --> 01:05:24,117
'cause I'm a kid,
'cause I'm a nerd.

1143
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:26,551
I'm told all kinds of reasons.

1144
01:05:26,585 --> 01:05:28,754
She was always nice to me.

1145
01:05:28,787 --> 01:05:30,522
Not 'cause she had to be.

1146
01:05:30,555 --> 01:05:32,491
Everybody at that school liked
her just 'cause she wanted

1147
01:05:32,524 --> 01:05:34,359
to be and she goes missing.

1148
01:05:34,392 --> 01:05:36,294
We might have seen her go
into a hole in the ground

1149
01:05:36,328 --> 01:05:37,763
and now everyone just
wants to wait around

1150
01:05:37,796 --> 01:05:38,831
and see what happens?

1151
01:05:39,765 --> 01:05:40,900
What can we do?

1152
01:05:40,933 --> 01:05:42,501
We can chose to not look away.

1153
01:05:42,534 --> 01:05:44,003
We can stand up
and do something,

1154
01:05:44,036 --> 01:05:46,239
even if other people aren't.

1155
01:05:46,271 --> 01:05:47,140
Just 'cause it's the hard thing

1156
01:05:47,173 --> 01:05:48,841
doesn't mean it's
not the right thing.

1157
01:05:50,742 --> 01:05:54,180
We can do what we can
and give this to anyone

1158
01:05:54,213 --> 01:05:55,714
who tells us what we can't do.

1159
01:06:00,186 --> 01:06:01,954
Unless the default
settings are turned off

1160
01:06:01,988 --> 01:06:03,122
our phones should keep
everywhere we've been

1161
01:06:03,156 --> 01:06:04,790
for the last month or so.

1162
01:06:04,823 --> 01:06:06,225
Hidden file in the OS.

1163
01:06:06,259 --> 01:06:07,692
Clay hasn't changed
the settings.

1164
01:06:07,726 --> 01:06:08,995
It could have where he's been.

1165
01:06:09,028 --> 01:06:10,830
And where he might
have put Cassie.

1166
01:06:10,863 --> 01:06:12,364
Cop said she was
looking for evidence,

1167
01:06:12,397 --> 01:06:13,365
let's get her some.

1168
01:06:16,768 --> 01:06:18,770
Can't believe he's
just sitting there.

1169
01:06:18,804 --> 01:06:20,840
He has, he has to look normal.

1170
01:06:20,873 --> 01:06:22,741
You guys sure you
want to do this?

1171
01:06:22,774 --> 01:06:24,476
What if there are consequences?

1172
01:06:25,377 --> 01:06:27,146
Fuck the consequences.

1173
01:06:28,446 --> 01:06:30,816
Good, I hate that guy.

1174
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:34,519
(light hearted tense music)

1175
01:06:42,094 --> 01:06:43,262
You got him?

1176
01:06:46,464 --> 01:06:47,399
(phone buzzing)

1177
01:06:47,432 --> 01:06:48,800
Also known as
(speaking foreign language).

1178
01:06:48,835 --> 01:06:53,272
Sitting Blue was a chief of
the Hunkpapa Lakota tribe

1179
01:06:53,306 --> 01:06:54,406
part of the seven tribes
of the Sioux nation

1180
01:06:55,607 --> 01:06:58,110
and the reason that we are
talking about him today

1181
01:06:58,144 --> 01:07:03,149
because there was a treaty
in 1868 (clears throat)

1182
01:07:05,517 --> 01:07:06,751
and it was...

1183
01:07:06,785 --> 01:07:10,056
(lighthearted tense music)

1184
01:07:10,089 --> 01:07:12,757
(phone buzzing)

1185
01:07:13,993 --> 01:07:15,995
Is wearing full war regalia,

1186
01:07:16,028 --> 01:07:19,065
he's completely decked out,
even the horse is decked out

1187
01:07:19,098 --> 01:07:20,032
and what...

1188
01:07:20,933 --> 01:07:23,635
Put it away, final warning.

1189
01:07:25,938 --> 01:07:29,075
Fighting amongst themselves
and with the US government.

1190
01:07:29,108 --> 01:07:32,345
(phone buzzing)

1191
01:07:32,377 --> 01:07:34,313
No, he's ignoring it.

1192
01:07:36,381 --> 01:07:37,216
(phone buzzing)

1193
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:38,217
We'll go through listing

1194
01:07:38,251 --> 01:07:39,919
all of the events
that lead up to.

1195
01:07:39,952 --> 01:07:43,189
So, let me just take a look
at what you've got so far.

1196
01:07:43,222 --> 01:07:46,791
(lighthearted tense music)

1197
01:08:07,113 --> 01:08:09,681
(bell ringing)

1198
01:08:19,524 --> 01:08:20,927
Free period, he's grading.

1199
01:08:21,894 --> 01:08:25,197
Serial WN 27843.

1200
01:08:25,231 --> 01:08:28,267
Try pound nine zero zero six.

1201
01:08:35,408 --> 01:08:37,676
(coughing)

1202
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:47,386
Hey.

1203
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:49,554
I'm sorry about the
thing with Grant.

1204
01:08:51,424 --> 01:08:52,624
It's okay.

1205
01:08:52,657 --> 01:08:53,491
Is it?

1206
01:08:56,695 --> 01:08:58,596
I mean, do you like him?

1207
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:02,201
I don't know, I mean
he can be a douche bag.

1208
01:09:02,234 --> 01:09:03,601
That's for sure.

1209
01:09:03,635 --> 01:09:05,938
But maybe I do?

1210
01:09:06,805 --> 01:09:08,707
It's just, you
said what you said

1211
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:11,509
and I don't really
know what it meant.

1212
01:09:11,543 --> 01:09:16,148
I guess it meant
you're my best friend.

1213
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:18,783
You're my best friend, too.

1214
01:09:18,817 --> 01:09:23,022
And I don't want anything
to mess with that.

1215
01:09:23,956 --> 01:09:24,789
Not possible.

1216
01:09:40,805 --> 01:09:41,806
(intercom beeps)

1217
01:09:41,841 --> 01:09:44,509
Mr. Dexter, please
come to the library.

1218
01:09:44,542 --> 01:09:47,612
Mr. Dexter, come to
the library, please.

1219
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:52,584
(lighthearted tense music)

1220
01:10:06,932 --> 01:10:10,036
(phone buzzing)

1221
01:10:10,069 --> 01:10:14,073
(lighthearted tense jazz music)

1222
01:10:23,449 --> 01:10:26,485
(phone buzzing)

1223
01:10:26,519 --> 01:10:27,319
You got it?

1224
01:10:27,353 --> 01:10:28,320
No, I can't find it.

1225
01:10:28,354 --> 01:10:29,188
It's not in his desk.
It's gotta be in there.

1226
01:10:29,221 --> 01:10:30,122
Just keep looking.

1227
01:10:35,261 --> 01:10:36,262
Shit.

1228
01:10:36,295 --> 01:10:37,096
What?

1229
01:10:37,129 --> 01:10:37,930
He's coming back.

1230
01:10:37,963 --> 01:10:38,831
Already?

1231
01:10:38,864 --> 01:10:40,533
Just stay, I'll buy
you a few minutes.

1232
01:10:40,565 --> 01:10:42,034
Just find it.

1233
01:10:42,068 --> 01:10:43,635
Wait, what are you doing?

1234
01:10:43,668 --> 01:10:45,104
What's happening?

1235
01:10:45,137 --> 01:10:46,604
Consequences.

1236
01:10:46,638 --> 01:10:50,209
(lighthearted tense music)

1237
01:10:55,081 --> 01:10:56,982
Holly, what the
hell are you doing?

1238
01:10:57,016 --> 01:10:58,150
This is bullshit.

1239
01:10:58,184 --> 01:10:59,885
This school isn't
gonna change my life,

1240
01:10:59,919 --> 01:11:01,420
you make it worse.

1241
01:11:02,388 --> 01:11:04,656
I hate this school!

1242
01:11:04,689 --> 01:11:05,958
Just calm down.

1243
01:11:05,991 --> 01:11:09,228
(indistinct shouting)

1244
01:11:09,261 --> 01:11:10,830
Holly, calm down.

1245
01:11:10,863 --> 01:11:12,932
Calm down, stop
tearing these down.

1246
01:11:12,965 --> 01:11:15,167
Holly, just stop.
Screw you.

1247
01:11:15,201 --> 01:11:16,368
Give me those.

1248
01:11:16,402 --> 01:11:18,636
They beat up my friend and
now they do nothing about it.

1249
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:20,139
No, Holly...
Screw this school.

1250
01:11:20,172 --> 01:11:22,707
Holly, stop it, calm down.

1251
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:23,708
Holly!

1252
01:11:23,741 --> 01:11:26,912
(indistinct shouting)

1253
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:29,181
Stop it.

1254
01:11:29,215 --> 01:11:30,216
No way.

1255
01:11:30,249 --> 01:11:31,016
Give those to me.

1256
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:31,851
They're mine.

1257
01:11:31,884 --> 01:11:32,985
I think you better
call security.

1258
01:11:33,018 --> 01:11:34,453
Screw you, too.

1259
01:11:35,387 --> 01:11:36,555
Security!

1260
01:11:36,589 --> 01:11:40,159
(lighthearted tense music)

1261
01:11:42,561 --> 01:11:43,362
No, no!

1262
01:11:43,395 --> 01:11:45,297
Calm down, just calm down.

1263
01:11:48,733 --> 01:11:50,903
(sobbing)

1264
01:11:51,736 --> 01:11:52,571
What's going on?

1265
01:11:53,973 --> 01:11:55,841
What is going on?

1266
01:11:58,244 --> 01:12:00,412
(sobbing)

1267
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,395
One of those days.

1268
01:12:16,428 --> 01:12:19,999
(lighthearted tense music)

1269
01:12:57,102 --> 01:12:57,937
Hey, dude!

1270
01:13:02,107 --> 01:13:03,409
What the hell?

1271
01:13:03,442 --> 01:13:04,243
You stole your parents car?

1272
01:13:04,276 --> 01:13:05,077
It's better than a bike.

1273
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:05,945
You get it?

1274
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:26,065
Hey, so about that
thing with me and Holly.

1275
01:13:26,365 --> 01:13:28,534
It's fine, we talked about it.

1276
01:13:28,567 --> 01:13:29,401
Yeah?

1277
01:13:31,337 --> 01:13:32,171
Oh.

1278
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:36,075
Well, I just wanted
you to know that it's...

1279
01:13:36,108 --> 01:13:37,876
Now is not the time.

1280
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:38,743
Sure.

1281
01:13:42,715 --> 01:13:45,750
Is it fine like
actually fine or is it...

1282
01:13:47,953 --> 01:13:49,521
It's encrypted.

1283
01:13:49,555 --> 01:13:50,689
Well can you cracked it?

1284
01:13:50,723 --> 01:13:52,491
Well I had hoped
he had an older OS

1285
01:13:52,524 --> 01:13:53,559
or hadn't set it up

1286
01:13:53,592 --> 01:13:57,663
but it's the latest
version and it's encrypted.

1287
01:13:59,265 --> 01:14:01,166
I just thought if
we did something it,

1288
01:14:02,001 --> 01:14:05,204
if only we could talk to
her, just for a minute,

1289
01:14:05,237 --> 01:14:07,339
she could tell us what happened.

1290
01:14:07,373 --> 01:14:11,410
(somber reflective music)

1291
01:14:11,443 --> 01:14:13,912
I trusted him and
then I found out

1292
01:14:13,946 --> 01:14:15,147
that I shouldn't have.

1293
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:17,116
Found things the he
was hiding from me.

1294
01:14:18,783 --> 01:14:19,718
Maybe we can.

1295
01:14:30,162 --> 01:14:30,996
Dude?

1296
01:14:32,898 --> 01:14:35,200
She found things.

1297
01:14:35,234 --> 01:14:36,635
She found things.

1298
01:14:37,536 --> 01:14:40,272
I know I'd seen
that name before.

1299
01:14:40,306 --> 01:14:43,876
(lighthearted tense music)

1300
01:14:56,622 --> 01:14:58,490
What happened to you?

1301
01:14:58,524 --> 01:15:01,527
Suspended, people with
perfect records are boring.

1302
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,262
Did you find anything?

1303
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:05,197
GPS log gets lost in the woods

1304
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:06,665
but he went back into that park,

1305
01:15:06,699 --> 01:15:08,367
close to where we
saw him that night

1306
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,736
and left out the same
entrance an hour later

1307
01:15:10,769 --> 01:15:12,504
and then he was there right

1308
01:15:12,538 --> 01:15:14,239
before we were
there with the cops.

1309
01:15:14,273 --> 01:15:15,140
Holy shit.

1310
01:15:15,174 --> 01:15:16,575
That's not the best part.

1311
01:15:16,608 --> 01:15:17,409
What's the best part?

1312
01:15:17,443 --> 01:15:18,744
I saw him earlier this morning

1313
01:15:18,777 --> 01:15:20,212
on the other side of the park.

1314
01:15:20,245 --> 01:15:22,781
Wait, isn't now when
we call the cops?

1315
01:15:22,815 --> 01:15:24,683
Clay moved the body, remember?

1316
01:15:24,717 --> 01:15:25,984
The only people we
told were the cops.

1317
01:15:26,018 --> 01:15:27,853
What if one of them
tipped him off,

1318
01:15:27,886 --> 01:15:28,921
what if that's how he knew

1319
01:15:28,954 --> 01:15:30,356
and what if they
tip him off again?

1320
01:15:30,389 --> 01:15:33,092
We need hard proof,
we need to find her.

1321
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:34,793
What if Clay shows up?

1322
01:15:34,828 --> 01:15:36,628
Don't make me give
you the finger.

1323
01:15:37,529 --> 01:15:39,031
You're going no matter what?

1324
01:15:45,537 --> 01:15:47,673
What does he mean the finger?

1325
01:15:47,706 --> 01:15:49,274
I need to stop by my house.

1326
01:15:52,644 --> 01:15:54,012
My dad's rifle's locked up.

1327
01:16:03,122 --> 01:16:04,022
You are amazing.

1328
01:16:06,425 --> 01:16:08,227
Why'd you bring a Porsche?

1329
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:09,895
My dad took the Beemer to work.

1330
01:16:11,997 --> 01:16:13,265
What?

1331
01:16:13,298 --> 01:16:16,168
Just don't get us pulled over.

1332
01:16:16,201 --> 01:16:17,035
Hey.

1333
01:16:19,171 --> 01:16:20,139
You were right.

1334
01:16:21,507 --> 01:16:25,177
I can be selfish
sometimes but I'm here.

1335
01:16:26,311 --> 01:16:27,346
Okay.

1336
01:16:32,418 --> 01:16:35,254
(low tense music)

1337
01:16:42,294 --> 01:16:45,464
(indistinct chatting)

1338
01:16:53,472 --> 01:16:55,007
(knocking)

1339
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:55,875
Mr. Howard.

1340
01:16:56,942 --> 01:16:57,776
Almost forgot.

1341
01:16:59,478 --> 01:17:02,314
(low tense music)

1342
01:17:23,635 --> 01:17:25,905
I dropped a pin to
mark where he was.

1343
01:17:25,939 --> 01:17:27,473
Should be somewhere over there.

1344
01:17:47,192 --> 01:17:48,093
Over there.

1345
01:17:49,194 --> 01:17:52,030
(low tense music)

1346
01:18:52,691 --> 01:18:55,527
(low tense music)

1347
01:19:14,613 --> 01:19:16,782
(panting)

1348
01:19:22,287 --> 01:19:24,456
(sobbing)

1349
01:19:27,492 --> 01:19:30,596
(somber tense music)

1350
01:19:36,668 --> 01:19:37,669
Hey, Cassie.

1351
01:19:56,089 --> 01:19:58,757
(phone beeping)

1352
01:20:00,525 --> 01:20:02,127
(static crackling)

1353
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:02,996
Shit.

1354
01:20:05,697 --> 01:20:06,565
Marcus!

1355
01:20:22,748 --> 01:20:25,584
(low tense music)

1356
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:46,105
Marcus!

1357
01:20:47,874 --> 01:20:48,774
Give me the phone.

1358
01:20:51,176 --> 01:20:52,011
Toss it.

1359
01:20:53,046 --> 01:20:53,946
Toss it right now!

1360
01:20:54,914 --> 01:20:56,916
(gunshot)

1361
01:20:56,949 --> 01:20:58,684
Give me the phone.

1362
01:21:02,688 --> 01:21:04,322
Don't move.

1363
01:21:04,356 --> 01:21:05,958
Don't fucking move.

1364
01:21:15,968 --> 01:21:17,369
Who was that to?

1365
01:21:18,503 --> 01:21:19,805
Huh?

1366
01:21:19,839 --> 01:21:21,941
Who, who was it to?

1367
01:21:21,974 --> 01:21:25,243
(tense dramatic music)

1368
01:21:28,848 --> 01:21:29,681
Shit.

1369
01:21:33,685 --> 01:21:35,088
Who else are you here with?

1370
01:21:35,121 --> 01:21:35,922
It's just me.

1371
01:21:35,955 --> 01:21:37,857
Bullshit, you drove the Porsche?

1372
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:39,257
I hacked your phone.

1373
01:21:39,291 --> 01:21:41,226
Tells the cops everything
they need to know,

1374
01:21:41,259 --> 01:21:43,096
whether or not I say anything.

1375
01:21:43,129 --> 01:21:44,696
You have it?

1376
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:46,698
It's already on its way to them.

1377
01:21:46,732 --> 01:21:49,068
I can still tell
when you're lying.

1378
01:21:49,102 --> 01:21:50,268
It was you, right?

1379
01:21:50,302 --> 01:21:52,370
It was you the other
night in the woods?

1380
01:21:56,274 --> 01:21:59,444
Yeah, I really wish
you hadn't seen me.

1381
01:21:59,478 --> 01:22:02,748
(tense dramatic music)

1382
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:08,520
Just gonna kill me, too?

1383
01:22:14,593 --> 01:22:18,663
I didn't kill her.

1384
01:22:18,697 --> 01:22:19,698
I loved her.

1385
01:22:31,710 --> 01:22:33,378
I didn't kill her, man.

1386
01:22:33,411 --> 01:22:34,646
I saw you burying her.

1387
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:38,450
I could never hurt her.

1388
01:22:38,483 --> 01:22:42,221
She was the most
important thing to me.

1389
01:22:42,255 --> 01:22:45,757
(somber reflective music)

1390
01:22:47,692 --> 01:22:49,594
She'd been dating
Bryan for forever but,

1391
01:22:53,132 --> 01:22:57,069
I mean I never felt
something like that before.

1392
01:22:59,771 --> 01:23:02,674
I think she had a sense of
what I was into but I...

1393
01:23:02,707 --> 01:23:04,342
Clay, Will.

1394
01:23:04,376 --> 01:23:05,278
Will, Clay.

1395
01:23:06,778 --> 01:23:08,647
I don't think she knew how deep.

1396
01:23:11,284 --> 01:23:13,552
Or what the people
I was involved with

1397
01:23:13,585 --> 01:23:14,921
were capable of.

1398
01:23:17,924 --> 01:23:19,391
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1399
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:22,761
(somber dramatic music)

1400
01:23:24,696 --> 01:23:26,299
The other day she
broke into my phone,

1401
01:23:26,331 --> 01:23:28,034
saw what I was doing.

1402
01:23:28,067 --> 01:23:29,534
Saw that I thought Will's people

1403
01:23:29,568 --> 01:23:31,736
were behind the
murder going done.

1404
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:34,506
Said she couldn't be
with someone like that.

1405
01:23:34,539 --> 01:23:35,807
I told her I was just
in it for the money,

1406
01:23:35,842 --> 01:23:38,443
that I, that I could take
care of her if she wanted.

1407
01:23:39,377 --> 01:23:42,248
She said she didn't love me.

1408
01:23:43,415 --> 01:23:46,319
Never loved me,
said it was over.

1409
01:23:46,351 --> 01:23:47,253
I told her I'd give it up,

1410
01:23:47,286 --> 01:23:49,554
I'd go to college.

1411
01:23:49,588 --> 01:23:52,158
Whatever she wanted, I'd do it.

1412
01:23:52,191 --> 01:23:53,491
Do you even care about me?

1413
01:23:53,525 --> 01:23:54,927
I begged her.

1414
01:23:54,961 --> 01:23:57,997
She told me stay away and
that if I came any closer

1415
01:23:58,030 --> 01:24:00,665
she'd call the cops and
tell them what I was doing.

1416
01:24:00,699 --> 01:24:01,868
Cassie, I can keep you safe!

1417
01:24:01,901 --> 01:24:03,435
Cassie, I love you.

1418
01:24:03,468 --> 01:24:04,536
Let go of me.
I love you.

1419
01:24:04,569 --> 01:24:05,370
Let go of me.

1420
01:24:05,403 --> 01:24:06,538
Let fucking go of me.

1421
01:24:06,571 --> 01:24:09,909
(somber dramatic music)

1422
01:24:13,712 --> 01:24:18,050
I never saw her again.

1423
01:24:18,084 --> 01:24:19,986
What happened to her?

1424
01:24:21,453 --> 01:24:24,290
She started telling people
what she saw in my phone

1425
01:24:24,323 --> 01:24:26,725
and that she had
to go to the cops.

1426
01:24:26,758 --> 01:24:29,262
Tell them that she knew
who was behind the murders.

1427
01:24:30,562 --> 01:24:32,298
It must have gotten back
to Will that she knew

1428
01:24:33,398 --> 01:24:34,267
and that she was gonna talk.

1429
01:24:35,167 --> 01:24:37,402
Shut the fuck up!

1430
01:24:37,435 --> 01:24:40,772
(somber dramatic music)

1431
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:49,315
(screaming)

1432
01:24:49,348 --> 01:24:51,150
Told you he wasn't ready.

1433
01:24:52,684 --> 01:24:54,452
They told me to bury her.

1434
01:24:54,486 --> 01:24:55,955
Told me to clean up my mess

1435
01:24:56,821 --> 01:24:58,823
and he made it clear what
would happen if I didn't,

1436
01:24:58,858 --> 01:25:01,760
to me, to Robbie, to my crew.

1437
01:25:03,963 --> 01:25:08,267
Oh shit, oh shit Marcus I
told them I was coming here.

1438
01:25:08,301 --> 01:25:10,735
Marcus, you need to go.

1439
01:25:10,769 --> 01:25:11,603
Yo, Clay where you at?

1440
01:25:13,772 --> 01:25:14,739
Shit.

1441
01:25:14,773 --> 01:25:15,707
Marcus, go.

1442
01:25:16,641 --> 01:25:17,475
Marcus, my phone.

1443
01:25:21,147 --> 01:25:22,214
Marcus.

1444
01:25:22,248 --> 01:25:25,483
(tense dramatic music)

1445
01:25:34,961 --> 01:25:37,629
Yeah man, she's right over here.

1446
01:25:52,111 --> 01:25:54,046
Will aint too happy.

1447
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:58,050
Too many people talking,
now that 5-0's on it.

1448
01:25:58,084 --> 01:26:00,052
Hell, when you kill
someone people notice.

1449
01:26:00,086 --> 01:26:01,420
Not when you do it right.

1450
01:26:02,821 --> 01:26:04,190
Why y'all dig her up.

1451
01:26:05,291 --> 01:26:06,092
We're gonna move her again.

1452
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:07,692
Again?

1453
01:26:07,726 --> 01:26:08,760
Why?

1454
01:26:08,793 --> 01:26:10,997
We thought somebody maybe
saw us leaving the park.

1455
01:26:12,431 --> 01:26:13,531
Damn, boy.

1456
01:26:13,565 --> 01:26:15,267
You fucked this up right.

1457
01:26:15,301 --> 01:26:17,535
Who's Porsche is that?

1458
01:26:17,569 --> 01:26:18,737
It's Robbie's.

1459
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:19,604
Oh.

1460
01:26:20,473 --> 01:26:21,374
That's your car?

1461
01:26:25,777 --> 01:26:28,780
Well, you aint say nothing
about having to move

1462
01:26:28,813 --> 01:26:31,484
when you called, said
your phone was gone.

1463
01:26:31,516 --> 01:26:32,751
That some shit on
there might be trouble.

1464
01:26:32,784 --> 01:26:33,685
Yeah, false alarm.

1465
01:26:33,718 --> 01:26:35,054
You got it, let me see it.

1466
01:26:36,455 --> 01:26:38,024
Hey, I see you.

1467
01:26:38,057 --> 01:26:39,691
Hey, hey, hey.

1468
01:26:40,792 --> 01:26:41,593
We don't want any trouble, man.

1469
01:26:41,626 --> 01:26:43,628
Aight, just go.

1470
01:26:43,661 --> 01:26:44,497
We got it under control.

1471
01:26:44,529 --> 01:26:45,331
Who's over there?

1472
01:26:45,364 --> 01:26:46,298
No one.

1473
01:26:46,332 --> 01:26:48,566
He's just a kid, he
didn't see anything.

1474
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,435
He's not gonna be a problem.

1475
01:26:49,468 --> 01:26:50,635
Well step on out, kid.

1476
01:26:50,668 --> 01:26:53,873
No, no, no don't move,
don't move, don't move.

1477
01:26:53,906 --> 01:26:54,706
The kid walks.

1478
01:27:02,214 --> 01:27:03,049
Holy shit.

1479
01:27:04,216 --> 01:27:05,017
Fuck!

1480
01:27:05,051 --> 01:27:05,851
Oh shit.

1481
01:27:05,885 --> 01:27:08,154
(gunshots)

1482
01:27:09,021 --> 01:27:11,190
(gunshot)

1483
01:27:15,061 --> 01:27:15,895
No!

1484
01:27:16,761 --> 01:27:19,031
(gunshots)

1485

Head back towards the car.

1486
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,002
If you get a signal,
you call 911.

1487
01:27:23,035 --> 01:27:24,370
If you get to the
car, get out of here.

1488
01:27:24,403 --> 01:27:25,271
What about you?

(tense dramatic music)

1490
01:27:32,044 --> 01:27:33,412

1494
01:27:44,256 --> 01:27:45,858

I'll lead them away if I can.

1497
01:27:47,659 --> 01:27:49,895
They could kill you.

1498
01:27:49,929 --> 01:27:50,896
Go, go.

1499
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:51,897

(gunshots)

1505
01:28:58,730 --> 01:28:59,532
I gotta go back.

1506
01:28:59,565 --> 01:29:00,765
We need to make that call

1507
01:29:00,798 --> 01:29:02,535

Listen, they're after my boy.

1564

How many?

1565

Responding at the scene.

1568

Two armed suspects, shots fired.

01:32:22,935 --> 01:32:25,971
Two vics, I'm gonna
need an Ambo for one.

It's gonna be okay, okay?

01:32:33,512 --> 01:32:34,513
My boy.

1574

it has that phone.

1587

1594
01:33:50,389 --> 01:33:52,191
Jesus, I didn't think
it hurt this much.

1595
01:33:52,224 --> 01:33:53,927
Ambulance is on it's way.

1596

Ma'am, keep your mask on.

1631

01:37:19,966 --> 01:37:23,168
Want me to go?

1636
01:37:23,201 --> 01:37:24,037
Holly!

1637
01:37:30,143 --> 01:37:31,844
I'm gonna take you

1638
01:37:39,685 --> 01:37:41,286
No.

Hey, you okay?

You were good police, today.

1649

B-team is coming to take over.

1650
01:39:14,147 --> 01:39:15,814
Get what rest you can.

1651

1654
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:37,170
Yeah, well if he's
really badly hurt

1655
01:39:37,203 --> 01:39:38,436
he doesn't have a lot of time.

1656
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:39,872
You really want
to help this kid.

1657
01:39:39,906 --> 01:39:41,040
Well, some of us
signed up for this job

1658
01:39:41,073 --> 01:39:42,008
for more than the
pension, right?

1659
01:39:42,041 --> 01:39:42,975
I didn't sign up
for the pension.

1660
01:39:43,009 --> 01:39:44,309
I talked to Matt Schwartz.

1661
01:39:51,050 --> 01:39:51,951
Yeah.

1662
01:39:51,984 --> 01:39:53,853
He said that he was
on phones the night

1663
01:39:53,886 --> 01:39:55,254
the kid called in.

1664
01:39:55,288 --> 01:39:56,856
He said you took over for him

1665
01:39:56,889 --> 01:39:58,390
when we went to go
pick up his lo mein.

1666
01:39:58,423 --> 01:40:02,829
It's not much but if I keep
digging I'm gonna find more,

1667
01:40:02,862 --> 01:40:03,695
won't I?

1668
01:40:06,398 --> 01:40:07,699
You know why you
didn't make lieutenant

1669
01:40:07,732 --> 01:40:08,533
three years ago?

1670
01:40:08,567 --> 01:40:09,401
I don't know, why do you think

1671
01:40:09,434 --> 01:40:10,837
I didn't make lieutenant
three years ago?

1672
01:40:10,870 --> 01:40:13,338
It's not 'cause I told the
bosses you hit that kid,

1673
01:40:13,371 --> 01:40:15,007
it's because you
put a 15 year old

1674
01:40:15,041 --> 01:40:17,009
in the hospital for
mouthing off to you.

1675
01:40:17,043 --> 01:40:18,476
He's deaf in his left ear.

1676
01:40:18,510 --> 01:40:20,378
His jaw will never be the same

1677
01:40:20,412 --> 01:40:21,881
and that aint being good police,

1678
01:40:21,914 --> 01:40:24,283
at least it shouldn't be.

1679
01:40:24,317 --> 01:40:26,219
Some lines, when you cross them,

1680
01:40:26,252 --> 01:40:27,819
it's gotta count
for some things.

1681
01:40:27,854 --> 01:40:30,323
So, yeah.

1682
01:40:30,355 --> 01:40:32,191
I filed that report.

1683
01:40:33,092 --> 01:40:34,293
You're damn right I did.

1684
01:40:36,128 --> 01:40:38,563
But today, you saved that woman,

1685
01:40:39,464 --> 01:40:42,801
Steve, and those kids, and
even Howard is hanging on

1686
01:40:42,835 --> 01:40:47,840
in the ICU, so this thing,
whatever you're into, it's over.

1687
01:40:55,147 --> 01:40:55,982
It's over.

1688
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:59,784
You were good
police today, Steve.

1689
01:40:59,818 --> 01:41:01,921
I hope wherever you end up

1690
01:41:01,954 --> 01:41:04,357
you're the cop
that you are today.

1691
01:41:04,389 --> 01:41:06,058
But it can't be in my precinct.

1692
01:41:07,492 --> 01:41:08,327
You understand?

1693
01:41:12,530 --> 01:41:13,366
Yeah.

1694
01:41:14,766 --> 01:41:15,700
Go home, Steve.

1695
01:41:24,643 --> 01:41:26,913
(groaning)

1696
01:41:32,550 --> 01:41:33,685
They're still looking.

1697
01:41:33,718 --> 01:41:35,553
But nothing yet.

1698
01:41:35,587 --> 01:41:37,390
It's two in the morning.

1699
01:41:37,422 --> 01:41:38,958
They had to do surgery.

1700
01:41:38,991 --> 01:41:40,893
You lost a lot of blood.

1701
01:41:40,927 --> 01:41:42,261
You need to rest.

1702
01:41:43,162 --> 01:41:44,931
For now, at least.

1703
01:41:44,964 --> 01:41:49,035
The number of times I've
said that to patients.

1704
01:41:50,303 --> 01:41:54,941
And I'm always surprised when
they don't want to listen.

1705
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:59,879
I tried to get Marcus to listen.

1706
01:42:00,947 --> 01:42:02,781
I tried to make him come with us

1707
01:42:04,016 --> 01:42:06,651
but he's so stubborn.

1708
01:42:11,057 --> 01:42:12,124
I'm mad at him.

1709
01:42:15,094 --> 01:42:15,928
Is that bad?

1710
01:42:16,996 --> 01:42:18,130
Are you mad at him?

1711
01:42:22,034 --> 01:42:22,868
You...

1712
01:42:28,274 --> 01:42:31,676
Won't have kids for
awhile but if you do,

1713
01:42:32,811 --> 01:42:37,049
from day one, you feed them
like you're feeding yourself.

1714
01:42:44,756 --> 01:42:48,394
You worry about their
future like it's your own.

1715
01:42:48,427 --> 01:42:50,695
(grunting)

1716
01:42:52,965 --> 01:42:57,203
Feel the pain when they hurt.

1717
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:00,072
(shouting)

1718
01:43:00,106 --> 01:43:01,107
When they're scared.

1719
01:43:03,808 --> 01:43:05,577
You get used to
taking care of them

1720
01:43:05,610 --> 01:43:07,880
like they're a part of you.

1721
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:12,952
But they're not really.

1722
01:43:16,422 --> 01:43:19,091
At some point, they
prove it to you.

1723
01:43:19,125 --> 01:43:22,194
They just become
their own thing.

1724
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:30,469
A part of me is mad, yeah,

1725
01:43:32,138 --> 01:43:34,739
that he didn't think
how it would hurt me

1726
01:43:34,773 --> 01:43:36,175
if anything happened to him.

1727
01:43:41,047 --> 01:43:43,082
But he's not really
my boy anymore.

1728
01:43:47,219 --> 01:43:48,220
It happened.

1729
01:43:49,687 --> 01:43:54,326
He made his decisions and
those decisions saved my life

1730
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:57,129
and maybe yours.

1731
01:44:00,466 --> 01:44:02,268
They brought justice
for that girl.

1732
01:44:09,408 --> 01:44:11,877
I wish he hadn't
done any of it but I,

1733
01:44:14,246 --> 01:44:15,081
I'm proud.

1734
01:44:18,851 --> 01:44:20,453
I am so damn proud.

1735
01:44:25,391 --> 01:44:26,724
He did more in one day

1736
01:44:26,758 --> 01:44:29,594
than most people
do in a lifetime.

1737
01:44:34,333 --> 01:44:36,469
He was so brave.

1738
01:44:36,502 --> 01:44:37,903
Marcus, Marcus!

1739
01:44:40,172 --> 01:44:43,075
How can I be mad
at him for that?

1740
01:44:47,279 --> 01:44:49,281
Hey, hey Marcus.

1741
01:44:49,315 --> 01:44:50,682
Hey, you there buddy?

1742
01:44:50,715 --> 01:44:52,617
Okay, okay.

1743
01:44:52,650 --> 01:44:53,486
Yeah, yeah, it's all right.

1744
01:44:53,519 --> 01:44:54,386
Let's get you up.

1745
01:44:57,923 --> 01:44:59,158
You'll be fine.

1746
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:02,294
Come on, here, put this on.

1747
01:45:02,328 --> 01:45:03,429
Hey, Captain!

1748
01:45:04,964 --> 01:45:06,565
Captain!

1749
01:45:06,599 --> 01:45:10,102
(somber reflective music)

1750
01:45:17,076 --> 01:45:18,377
There's one.

1751
01:45:18,410 --> 01:45:20,778
They look like fireworks.

1752
01:45:20,812 --> 01:45:23,282
Shooting stars totally
beat a blood moon.

1753
01:45:28,753 --> 01:45:30,189
I don't know.

1754
01:45:30,222 --> 01:45:32,391
Blood moons are super
rare, so kind of cooler

1755
01:45:32,424 --> 01:45:35,394
plus the whole end
of the world thing.

1756
01:45:35,427 --> 01:45:37,229
Blood moon doesn't mean
there's an apocalypse.

1757
01:45:37,263 --> 01:45:38,631
So you say.

1758
01:45:43,569 --> 01:45:45,437
Remember the last
time we did this?

1759
01:45:48,174 --> 01:45:52,111
She's gone but the world
just keeps on turning.

1760
01:45:53,546 --> 01:45:55,447
How is that right?

1761
01:45:55,481 --> 01:45:57,749
It aint right it just is.

1762
01:45:58,984 --> 01:45:59,952
So cold.

1763
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:03,389
It's like she died and
it doesn't even matter.

1764
01:46:05,591 --> 01:46:09,461
It does matter, to us.

1765
01:46:09,495 --> 01:46:12,131
Maybe the universe is cold
and maybe it doesn't care,

1766
01:46:13,065 --> 01:46:14,600
it doesn't meant that we can't.

1767
01:46:17,102 --> 01:46:19,338
I haven't forgotten
her and I won't.

1768
01:46:25,377 --> 01:46:28,813
(somber uplifting music)

1769
01:46:49,501 --> 01:46:52,404
(soft tense music)
