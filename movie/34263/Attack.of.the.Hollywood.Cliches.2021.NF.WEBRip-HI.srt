00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:15,875
Hi. Unlike you, I'm Rob Lowe,
and I love movies.

3
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:20,750
The fact is, I'd rather be watching
a movie than doing this right now.

4
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:24,750
But let's pretend I didn't say that
and just enjoy each other's company.

5
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,791
Thousands of movies
are released every year.

6
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,291
That's a lot of stories,

7
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,583
even though
according to screenwriting theory

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:37,125
there are only seven basic plots:
overcoming the monster...

9
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,083
and the other six.

10
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:43,291
It's little wonder that stock characters,

11
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,875
familiar story beats,
and convenient plot devices

12
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,166
have crept in over time.

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,708
Tonight, we celebrate the clichés
that have made cinema what it is today:

14
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:55,666
struggling for relevance
in the aftermath of a pandemic.

15
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:59,541
<i>Over the next hour,
we'll be looking at Tinseltown's habit</i>

these handy cinematic tropes in...</i>

17
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,583
Attack of the Hollywood Clichés!

18
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,125
<i>We'll be asking questions like,</i>

19

<i>"Why do women being chased
by large, scary dinosaurs</i>

<i>have to do it in high heels?"</i>

21
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,000
<i>As we build to some
of my favorite clichés,</i>

22
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:20,791
<i>we'll be looking at some of the most
dramatic moments in cinema.</i>

23
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,458
<i>Some of the most controversial.</i>

24
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,333
Sister is teaching the mothers
how to wash their children.

25

[Lowe] <i>How other clichés have been raised

[tires screech]

27
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:33,666
<i>And of course,
how Hollywood deals with sex.</i>

28
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,083
<i>And violence.</i>

29
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:40,750
And where better to begin
than with a familiar beginning,

30
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:44,458
from the world of romantic comedy,
it's the meet cute.

31
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:50,708
<i>That magical moment in movies
when the love begins.</i>

32
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,708
People watch romcoms to get high.

33
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:57,250
<i>They wanna experience
that first sensation of love</i>

34
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,750
<i>so that when they see those two people
meet for the very first time,</i>

35
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,500
<i>when that moment, that spark,</i>

36
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,583
<i>that chemistry happens,</i>

37
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,541
it feels so real to them

38
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,666
that they have that sensation
in their body.

39
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,625
There's always some funny, contrived
reason why you have the two people

40
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,916
who are gonna fall in love meet,

41

<i>They can't meet

- Lady, keep driving.
- [screams] Get out!

44
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,333
Some kind of embarrassing,
comedic, unlikely scenario...

45
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,083
that brings the two together.

46
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,791
I live just over the street.
I have, um, water and soap.

47
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,000
You can get cleaned up.

48
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,958
[Pugh]<i> If that happened in real life,</i>

49
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,208
you would throw
the rest of your juice in their face.

50
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,625
You'd be like, "No, get away from me."

51
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:45,416
In five minutes,
we can have you spick and span

52
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,875
and back on the street again,

53
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,291
in the non-prostitute sense, obviously.

54
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,375
[Lowe] <i>Whenever two people

of cinematic romance are ever present.</i>

56
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:03,791
I hate the water,
and I hate being wet, and I hate you!

57
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:04,958
Good!

58
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:08,041
They don't like each other,
are engaged or married to someone else.

59
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,000
Jack, I'm engaged.

60
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,666
I'm marrying Cal.

61
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,041
There has to be a struggle
to go through or else it would be boring.

62
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,875
[Lowe] <i>Of course, this being the movies,</i>

63
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:24,458
<i>male strategies vary from annoying
persistence to outright harassment.</i>

64
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,458
Well, how about this for a coincidence?

65
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:31,208
A lot of films which are shown
from the male point of view

66
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,625
feature what you would
really call stalking.

67
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,416
You wanna dance with me?

68
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,750
No.

69
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:37,833
Why not?

70
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,583
Because I don't want to.

71
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,875
- Well, will you go out with me?
- What?

72
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,583
- No!
- No?

73
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,333
- No!
- No?

74
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,708
- Hey, pal, she just told you.
- Why not?

75
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:52,375
Like in <i>Twilight,</i> when he
climbs up through her window

76
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,708
<i>and says, "I like watching you sleep."</i>

77
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,041
Do you do that a lot?

78
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,750
Just the past couple of months.

79
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:03,625
Stalking is sexy only applies
when it's men stalking women.

80
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:08,250
When women are persistent
or stalking male characters,

81
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,666
<i>they become the villain.</i>

82
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,416
I just wanna be a part of your life.

83
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,166
And this is the way you do it, huh?
Showing up at my apartment?

84
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,750
What am I supposed to do?

85
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,083
You won't answer my calls,
you change your number.

86
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,333
I'm not gonna be ignored, Dan.

87
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,541
[Lowe] <i>Every story needs a lead character
who commands attention,</i>

88
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,458
someone as unique, special,
and one-of-a-kind

89
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,208
as the lead in every other movie.

90
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,416
Since all aspects of your protagonists
have to be remarkable,

91
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,750
it's not enough for them
to just have a job.

92
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:39,291
Whatever that job is,
they gotta job the shit out of it,

93
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:43,625
especially if their job is the job:
the cop's job.

94
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,375
- You think I'm crazy?
- Yeah.

The way your movie is cast

depends on what kind of story
you're telling.

<i>Twenty men being blown to smithereens.</i>

00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,500
[Newman] <i>Throughout the silent era,</i>

306
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,916
characters on screen had to
express themselves physically

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,666
because people got bored
with the intertitle.

308

<i>They laughed at the flowery prose.</i>

309
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,833
So, what you get was lengthy fight scenes.

the first staged fist-fight for film</i>

[Lowe] <i>Fast forward 100 years or so,</i>

316
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,458
Something that I've loved
seeing in the last ten years

317
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:39,291

The other kind of fantastic,
I think, cliché,

00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,916

for us as an audience

321
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,666

on one kill at a time.

325
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,916
It's kind of very related
to video games, I think,

326
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,083
where this idea
that you might have all the skills

327

So Jackie Chan was my favorite.

331
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,916
<i>The reason he was so popular

333
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,250
It's absurd what he's doing,

334

The guy that played Uncle Remus

751
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,666
<i>James Baskett, became

he was competitive enough

754
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:30,291
to be in the Best Actor

755

You often don't know

758
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:45,000
why they're there, they just kind of exist

That vase.

762
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,083
I find the magical negro trope
very unrealistic,

763
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:58,392

00:45:40,791 --> 00:45:43,916
Thank you for playing
"Should we or should we not

[Lowe] <i>But what the hell,

900
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:57,458
<i>His stuff just doesn't go anywhere.</i>

901

<i>No wonder the keyboard gets a beating.</i>

902
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:07,458
Every hero needs a villain
to go up against.

903
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:10,000
It's taken us a while
to get around to him,

904
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:12,583
but he's been expecting you, Mr. Bond.

905
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:16,541
<i>If your hero is good-looking,</i>

906
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:20,083
<i>this means the clichéd bad guy
has to be the polar opposite,</i>

907
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:23,666
<i>and the filmmakers usually
make it easy for us to spot who they are.</i>

908
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:26,625
Allow me to introduce myself.

909
00:46:27,958 --> 00:46:31,166
I am Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

910
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:35,125
We make them other than us.
We make them ugly, disfigured.

911
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:38,833
Some scar to say that they're evil,
even if they're a lion.

912
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:40,208
Murderer.

913
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:43,333
You're telling a story,
you're telling the audience

914
00:46:43,416 --> 00:46:46,583
that your character has been
involved in nefarious activity

915
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:49,541
<i>and probably physical violence
in the past.</i>

916
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:53,625
...and fulfill your destiny.

917
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:56,416
The disfigured villain goes way back.

918
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:00,250
<i>Back to silent film.
You have, obviously, Lon Chaney</i>

919
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:01,791
<i>in </i>Phantom of the Opera,

920
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:05,083
with the hairpins
stretching his nostrils out.

921
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:11,708
The problem with that sort of
characterization is the fact that then,

922
00:47:11,791 --> 00:47:14,125
in real life, it translates to people

923
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:16,625
who have those physical disfigurements

924
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:20,625
being seen by other people
as dangerous, as scary,

925
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:22,125
as someone to shun.

926
00:47:22,208 --> 00:47:28,125
Certainly that equating of disfigurement
in some way turning you into a psychopath

927
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:30,833
is incredibly insulting.

928
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:33,541
A lot of villains
are more cultured than the hero.

929
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:37,083
You know, you'll have villains
who talk about their love of Beethoven.

930
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:38,916
You don't like Beethoven.

931
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,833
[Mark] <i>Loving the finer things in life...</i>

932
00:47:40,916 --> 00:47:42,541
You don't know what you're missing.

933
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:44,583
...gives a sense
that there is another side,

934
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:49,041
another side to them, which enhances
the fact that they're, you know, evil.

935
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:54,583
I ate his liver with some fava beans
and a nice Chianti.

936
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,708
They're often British.

937
00:47:58,791 --> 00:48:01,708
That tends to be
a real subcategory of villains.

938
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,916
In Hollywood, they thought
that an English accent

939
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,083
was a shorthand for sophistication.

940
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:11,291
Do you intend to cooperate with us?
I'd like a simple yes or no.

941
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:16,333
If your baddie had an English accent,
then the hero was dealing with something

942
00:48:16,416 --> 00:48:18,041
that wasn't just plain brutish.

943
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:20,208
There was something else behind it.

944
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:23,291
Somehow casting an English actor,
because we're cheap,

945
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:25,083
and you can say the dialogue,

946
00:48:25,166 --> 00:48:28,708
and you can say gibberish dialogue
with great conviction.

947
00:48:28,791 --> 00:48:33,625
History, tradition, culture,
are not concepts.

948
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:37,000
These are trophies
I keep in my den as paperweights!

949
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:41,916
The monologue is a cliché
because it's the stuff of drama.

950
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,916
Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.

951
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,791
It's the writer allowing the audience to
understand where this character comes from

952
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:52,708
and why they're doing what they're doing.

953
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:57,625
I had a villain's monologue
in the final sequence of <i>Logan.</i>

954
00:48:57,708 --> 00:49:01,083
I'm giving this verse
about why I've done what I've done

955
00:49:01,166 --> 00:49:02,708
and killed his family, all this.

956
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:06,125
I realized we needn't stop perfecting
what we eat and drink.

957
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:08,291
We use those products
to perfect ourselves.

958
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:10,500
And halfway through my monologue...

959
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:14,000
he kills me, deservedly.

960
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:18,666
There comes a time when every movie
simply has to stop happening.

961
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,125
And that time is known as the end.

962
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,458
It's when all the narrative plates
you've been spinning

963
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:26,916
have to suddenly weave together
in a better metaphor than this.

964
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,833
It's time for
the movie's climactic endgame,

965
00:49:29,916 --> 00:49:33,333
<i>and there are only
so many forms that can take.</i>

966
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:37,750
<i>The shower scene in Hitchcock's </i>Psycho

967
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:41,916
<i>with Janet Leigh is seen</i> by many
<i>to be the inspiration for our next cliché.</i>

968
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,958
<i>And for locks on bathroom doors.</i>

969
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:48,833
Hitchcock popularized this notion
that it would be women going through

970
00:49:48,916 --> 00:49:53,125
these horrific circumstances,
and he set up this expectation

971
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:56,500
<i>that women would play
a central role in thrillers.</i>

972
00:49:57,583 --> 00:50:00,250
[Lowe] <i>Eighteen years later,
Janet Leigh's daughter,</i>

973
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:02,208
<i>Jamie Lee Curtis, played a role</i>

974
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:06,500
<i>which made her an icon of the cliché
now known as the final girl.</i>

975
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:13,250
The monster versus the final girl,
Jamie Lee Curtis in <i>Halloween,</i>

976
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:15,708
symbolically stands as the first.

977
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:17,916
She is the blueprint, the prototype.

978
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,041
The final girl is the one girl
who doesn't have sex,

979
00:50:21,125 --> 00:50:23,333
who's more innocent than her friends.

980
00:50:23,416 --> 00:50:26,791
You must have a small fortune stashed
from babysitting so much.

981
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:28,375
Guys think I'm too smart.

982
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:29,916
Because she's not having sex,

983
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,333
she's somehow miraculously
more observant than all of her friends

984
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:35,125
and senses something wrong first.

985
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:37,708
If you want
a really good final-girl movie,

986
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:40,416
you need to take a group of friends...

987
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,125
If you listen to the old timers in town,
they'll tell you he's still out there.

988
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:48,083
They've all gone off
on a weekend party somewhere.

989
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:51,041
You need to give them
a spurious reason to go off

990
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:54,458
in different directions,
and get up to any kind of mischief.

991
00:50:54,541 --> 00:50:56,250
[suspenseful music playing]

992
00:50:56,333 --> 00:51:00,291
That's another cliché, another rule:
If you do the dirty deed,

993
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:01,541
you're gonna die.

994
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,916
One by one they are dispatched.

995
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,125
[cackling]

996
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:11,791
There's always a lull in these movies

997
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:14,583
where everyone thinks
the killer might be dead.

998
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:19,625
Then it all comes crashing down
and she has to prove herself again.

999
00:51:21,666 --> 00:51:25,458
But she survives and she becomes
the audience surrogate.

1000
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:29,875
[woman screaming]

1001
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:34,000
I think slasher films
and all their clichés

1002
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:39,625
would be completely dead right now
if there hadn't existed <i>Scream.</i>

1003
00:51:39,708 --> 00:51:43,250
[Lowe] Scream <i>turned the cliché
on its blood-splattered head</i>

1004
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:47,541
<i>by dispatching assumed final girl
Drew Barrymore in its opening moments.</i>

1005
00:51:49,291 --> 00:51:55,416
I think the <i>Scream</i> franchise
really addressed the horror fans

1006
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:00,875
and their knowledge of the clichés,
and sort of turned it on its head.

1007
00:52:00,958 --> 00:52:02,518
What's the point? They're all the same.

1008
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:04,916
Some stupid killer
stalking some big-breasted girl

1009
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,833
who's running up the stairs when
she should be going out the door.

1010
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:08,750
It's insulting.

[Lowe] <i>But the final girl
has appropriately survived.</i>

towards the end,</i>

1015

and we're making people
scared of her towards the end.

1016
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:23,250
Eat it, bitch!

1017
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:27,166
She is sometimes more deadly
than the people

1018
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,958
that she's actually
kind of fighting to survive.

1019
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:34,625
And technically,
has a much bigger body count

1020
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:38,000
than any of the would-be "killers"
in the movie.

1021
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:43,333
I think it's kind of evolved
as a cliché now

1022
00:52:43,416 --> 00:52:46,125
into almost
a kind of a comfort-food finale.

1023

<i>where one of the pair has a frenzied race
against time and geography</i>

1045
00:54:01,916 --> 00:54:04,541
<i>to declare undying love to their partner.</i>

1046
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:08,875
Often, that will involve
a last-minute lover's dash to the airport,

1047
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:10,833
<i>or to stop a wedding happening.</i>

1048
00:54:10,916 --> 00:54:13,125
The Graduate's<i> a classic one of that.</i>

1049
00:54:17,208 --> 00:54:19,541
Oh, Jesus, God, no.

1050
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:23,500
[Lowe] <i>Having chased and convinced
their other half of their eternal love,</i>

1051
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:27,666
<i>their reward is a passionate kiss,
usually in bad weather conditions.</i>

1052
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:32,541
[King] <i>It's when you're so wrapped up
in kissing the person you love</i>

1053
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:35,708
that you're not even aware
of the terrible weather.

1054
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:38,666
And I think that's what happened
in <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral,</i>

1055
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:41,708
was these two people
having all these obstacles

1056
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:46,708
not to be together,
and finally, in the rain...

1057
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,250
Is it still raining? I hadn't noticed.

1058
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:58,458
Greta Gerwig, the director,
did that for the end of <i>Little Women.</i>

1059
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:07,625
She wanted that end-of-the-movie shot,
and I remember chatting to her about this

1060
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:12,458
and she was like, "I want it, I want it,
I grew up watching it, and I want it."

1061
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:17,208
If things have gone right, at the end,
the audience is on the edge of their seat

1062
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:19,291
wondering whether the good guy will win,

1063
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:22,500
<i>while knowing, with every
fiber in their being, that he will.</i>

1064
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:27,833
Hey, why don't you pick on someone
your own size?

1065
00:55:27,916 --> 00:55:31,291
The morality tale
demands that the hero kills the villain.

1066
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:37,041
<i>The better the death,</i>

1067
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:41,250
the more satisfying
the vanquishing of the villain is.

1068
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:44,833
Someone falling from a great height
has been a classic way

1069
00:55:44,916 --> 00:55:46,541
to finish your story.

1070
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:49,166
<i>Brilliantly done in </i>Die Hard,<i> of course,</i>

1071
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:52,875
and it gives them a moment or two
to know that they're beaten.

1072
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:58,958
It's a very satisfying moment
for the audience.

1073
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:03,875
<i>It's to enable them to feel safe.
You vanquish the villain so you feel safe.</i>

1074
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:06,166
[screaming]

1075
00:56:07,583 --> 00:56:10,666
[Garfield] <i>And the more dastardly
the behavior of the villain,</i>

1076
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:14,916
the more karmic justice
we are praying for.

1077
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,166
There's a blood lust that a great villain
creates in an audience.

1078
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,083
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

1079
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:31,958
At the end of a movie, we want
to have good overcome bad.

1080
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:36,041
That's what drives that desire
to watch a movie with great heroes.

1081
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:39,500
That everything's gonna be okay
and the world's not scary.

1082
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:43,541
[Lowe] <i>Until the contractually
binding sequel brings them back,</i>

1083
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:46,500
<i>the last few moments of the movie
are for the heroes to bask</i>

1084
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:49,875
<i>in their hard-earned glory
before riding off into the distance.</i>

1085
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:54,458
Well, as I said at the start,
I've been Rob Lowe,

1086
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:57,583
and that's it
for our look at Hollywood clichés.

1087
00:56:57,666 --> 00:57:01,083
Nothing for me to do now except
jump on my horse and/or motorcycle

1088
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:04,708
and ride off into the sunset
while rock music and/or hip-hop kicks in.

1089
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:07,041
But that would ruin my suit.

1090
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:11,000
So let's just abruptly roll credits
when I snap my fingers.

1091
00:57:11,666 --> 00:57:14,666
