00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:15,875
Hi. Unlike you, I'm Rob Lowe,
and I love movies.

5
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:20,750
The fact is, I'd rather be watching
a movie than doing this right now.

6
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:24,750
But let's pretend I didn't say that
and just enjoy each other's company.

7
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,791
Thousands of movies
are released every year.

8
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,291
That's a lot of stories,

9
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,583
even though
according to screenwriting theory

10
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:37,125
there are only seven basic plots:
overcoming the monster...

11
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,083
and the other six.

12
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:43,291
It's little wonder that stock characters,

13
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,875
familiar story beats,
and convenient plot devices

14
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,166
have crept in over time.

15
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,708
Tonight, we celebrate the clichés
that have made cinema what it is today:

16
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:55,666
struggling for relevance
in the aftermath of a pandemic.

17
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:59,541
<i>Over the next hour,</i>
<i>we'll be looking at Tinseltown's habit</i>

18

19
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,583
Attack of the Hollywood Clichés!

20
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,125
{\an8}<i>We'll be asking questions like,</i>

21
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:11,833
{\an8}<i>"Why do women being chased</i>
<i>by large, scary dinosaurs</i>

22
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,625
<i>have to do it in high heels?"</i>

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,000
{\an8}<i>As we build to some</i>
<i>of my favorite clichés,</i>

24
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:20,791

{\an8}<i>Some of the most controversial.</i>

30
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,083
{\an8}<i>And violence.</i>

31
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:40,750
{\an8}And where better to begin
than with a familiar beginning,

32
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:44,458
from the world of romantic comedy,
it's the meet cute.

33
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:50,708
<i>That magical moment in movies</i>
<i>when the love begins.</i>

34
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,708
People watch romcoms to get high.

35
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:57,250
{\an8}<i>They wanna experience</i>
<i>that first sensation of love</i>

36
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,750
{\an8}<i>so that when they see those two people</i>
<i>meet for the very first time,</i>

37
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,500

38

39

00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,083
that brings the two together.

48
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,791
I live just over the street.
I have, um, water and soap.

49
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,000
You can get cleaned up.

50

[Pugh]<i> If that happened in real life,</i>

{\an8}Well, how about this for a coincidence?

67
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:31,208
A lot of films which are shown
from the male point of view

68
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,625
feature what you would
really call stalking.

69

because like all good co-stars,
they never hog the scenes.

An everyday seeming prop

234

can make even the most godlike figure
seem like a regular Joe.

the carbs through my skin.

The way your movie is cast

depends on what kind of story

of subtly different personality types,

00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,083
{\an8}was a shorthand for sophistication.

942
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:11,291
{\an8}Do you intend to cooperate with us?
I'd like a simple yes or no.

943
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:16,333
{\an8}If your baddie had an English accent,
then the hero was dealing with something

944
00:48:16,416 --> 00:48:18,041
that wasn't just plain brutish.

945
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:20,208
There was something else behind it.

946
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:23,291
Somehow casting an English actor,
because we're cheap,

947
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:25,083
{\an8}and you can say the dialogue,

948
00:48:25,166 --> 00:48:28,708
{\an8}and you can say gibberish dialogue
with great conviction.

949
00:48:28,791 --> 00:48:33,625
{\an8}History, tradition, culture,
are not concepts.

950
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:37,000
{\an8}These are trophies
I keep in my den as paperweights!

951
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:41,916
The monologue is a cliché
because it's the stuff of drama.

952
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,916
{\an8}Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.

953
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,791
{\an8}It's the writer allowing the audience to
understand where this character comes from

954
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:52,708
and why they're doing what they're doing.

955
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:57,625
I had a villain's monologue
in the final sequence of <i>Logan.</i>

956
00:48:57,708 --> 00:49:01,083
I'm giving this verse
about why I've done what I've done

957
00:49:01,166 --> 00:49:02,708
and killed his family, all this.

958
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:06,125
{\an8}I realized we needn't stop perfecting
what we eat and drink.

959
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:08,291
{\an8}We use those products
to perfect ourselves.

960
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:10,500
And halfway through my monologue...

961
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:14,000
he kills me, deservedly.

962
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:18,666
There comes a time when every movie
simply has to stop happening.

963
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,125
And that time is known as the end.

964
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,458
It's when all the narrative plates
you've been spinning

965
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:26,916
have to suddenly weave together
in a better metaphor than this.

966
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,833
It's time for
the movie's climactic endgame,

967
00:49:29,916 --> 00:49:33,333
<i>and there are only</i>
<i>so many forms that can take.</i>

968
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:37,750
{\an8}<i>The shower scene in Hitchcock's </i>Psycho

<i>And for locks on bathroom doors.</i>

971
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:48,833
Hitchcock popularized this notion
that it would be women going through

972
00:49:48,916 --> 00:49:53,125
{\an8}these horrific circumstances,
and he set up this expectation

973
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:56,500
{\an8}<i>that women would play</i>

{\an8}<i>which made her an icon of the cliché</i>

979
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:17,916
She is the blueprint, the prototype.

980
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,041
The final girl is the one girl
who doesn't have sex,

981
00:50:21,125 --> 00:50:23,333
{\an8}who's more innocent than her friends.

982
00:50:23,416 --> 00:50:26,791
{\an8}You must have a small fortune stashed
from babysitting so much.

983
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:28,375
{\an8}Guys think I'm too smart.

984
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:29,916
Because she's not having sex,

985
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,333
she's somehow miraculously
more observant than all of her friends

986
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:35,125
and senses something wrong first.

987
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:37,708
If you want
a really good final-girl movie,

988
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:40,416
you need to take a group of friends...

989
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,125
{\an8}If you listen to the old timers in town,
they'll tell you he's still out there.

{\an8}They've all gone off
on a weekend party somewhere.

991
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:51,041
You need to give them
a spurious reason to go off
