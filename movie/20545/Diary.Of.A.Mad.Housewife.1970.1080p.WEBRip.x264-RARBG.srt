[whistles]

00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,128
Good morning. Good morning.

5
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:02,263
Well, you certainly
had a good sleep.

6
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:05,133
You were dead to the world
when the alarm clock rang.

7
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,437
Quarter to eight, Tine.
I've been up for 15 minutes.

8
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,472
Come on, Tine. Get up.

9
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:13,841
[hums]

10
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,111
For God's sake,
Tine, snap to it.

00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:19,213
[humming]

12
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,856
Wish I could understand what's
the matter with you these days.

13
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,659
I'm really very worried
about you.

14
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:35,129
Take the way you look.
You don't look well.

15
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:38,432
Your color's rotten. You act
as if you're exhausted.

16
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:39,300
How could you be exhausted

17
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,302
the minute you get up
in the morning?

18
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:46,274
What's more. You're too thin,
for God's sake.

19
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,810
Oh, you used to have
a terrific figure.

20
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,680
You've gotten so bloody skinny.

21
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:56,217
And that God awful
hair of yours.

22
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,520
Just... hanging down.

23
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:03,191
No style. Well...

24
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,202
Maybe you don't care
what you look like

25
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:07,228
in front of me and the girls...

26
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:09,897
but what about
the rest of the world?

27
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,867
You're Mrs. Jonathan Balser.

28
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,170
My wife.

29
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:21,909
My wife is a reflection of me.

30
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:24,945
I'm only telling you this,

31
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,882
because I am deeply concerned
about you, Tina.

32
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,320
Tina, for God's sake,

33
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:35,289
do you know what you're doing
to your lungs?

34
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,494
To say nothing of your heart.

35
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:45,165
Do you know what you're doing to
your whole circulatory system?

36
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:49,470
Don't you have any
willpower at all?

37
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,275
[buzzing]

38
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:00,314
Put it out, Tine.

39
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,729
This is the softest
four-minute egg I ever saw.

40
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,931
If it is a four-minute egg.

41
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,535
Hey, Tine, is this
a four-minute egg?

42
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:25,239
Your mother made
Phi Beta Kapa at Smith,

43
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:27,508
but I don't think she can make
a four-minute egg.

44
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:33,314
[sighs]
Will you look at those trunks?

45
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:35,792
Back from the country
over two weeks.

46
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,551
She hasn't unpacked
those bloody trunks yet.

47
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,722
Hey, Tine...
better call an agency,

48
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,425
get a laundress over here
so you can unpack those trunks.

49
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,629
Is my bacon ready yet?
Twenty past eight.

50
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,065
Some more toast, Tine.

51
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:56,904
Hey, Tine, why don't you
get cracking on a thorough

52
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,907
fall house cleaning campaign
around here?

53
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,843
Get the floors waxed.
Get the windows washed.

54
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,313
Get this place looking
as if civilized people

55
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:06,947
are in residence. Hmm?

56
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,319
Gee, that's a little light,
isn't it?

57
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,454
I'm sorry. I hurried it.

58
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,889
Sweetie, can I have a little
more damson plum preserve,

59
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,358
please?

60
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:28,836
That was Hodison on the phone.
We're flying to Wichita at noon.

61
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,904
Will you please
pack my bag for me, Tine?

62
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,307
I'll send Miss Newby by
for it in about an hour.

63
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:39,780
Better pack my gray
Glen-plaid worsted from Sills

64
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,383
and four pairs
of gray Lisle socks.

65
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,418
And since I'll be
in court most of the time,

66
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:47,321
give me four pale blue shirts,
two Oxford Voile,

67
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:48,822
two Sea Island cotton.

68
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:52,360
I'll leave the ties up to you,
but keep the suit in mind.

69
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:55,062
Don't forget my robe
from Turnbill and Asser.

70
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,565
And my black wing-tipped shoes.
Not the new ones.

71
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,733
The ones I ordered
last year from Peal's.

72
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:04,071
And put everything in my
oxblood cowhide tan two suiter,

73
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,706
the one from T. Anthony.

Jonathan. You're back.
I didn't hear you come in.

92
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,516
Christ, don't you ever get
any ice out for this thing?

93
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:31,051
What's the matter?
Did something happen?

94
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,153
Yes, something happened.
My plane almost crashed

95
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,822
That's what happened.

96
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,924
Trouble with the landing gear.

97
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,892
Circled Kennedy
for about an hour.

98
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,629
Then the pilot
decided to try it.

99
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:43,697
That's what he told us
on the intercom.

100
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:45,666
- He'd try it.
- Poor darling.

101
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,935
Whole emergency squad
was waiting for us.

102
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,571
Foam trucks, ambulances...
What's this?

103
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:53,206
God, you know I hate
crummy Chinese food.

104
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,142
I didn't expect you back
till tomorrow.

105
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,385
Let the girls eat it.
I wanna go out.

106
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,846
- I'll fix you a hamburger.
- I don't want a damn hamburger.

107
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,114
I want a good dinner,
out, with some friends.

108
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,150
Let's get somebody
to go to Elaine's with us.

109
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,586
It's after 6:00.
They're probably all tied up.

110
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:08,522
I'm gonna take shower. Line up
a sitter and call the Willards

111
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:10,591
or call the Bards.
Get somebody!

112
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,837
Well, what's new?
Anybody call while I was gone?

113
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:26,073
Here comes rapture.

114
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:30,711
- Charlotte Rady called.
- Ch... Charlotte Rady?

115
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,214
Wow!
Why didn't you say so?

116
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,149
She's giving a benefit
for Joe Nemlo

117
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,518
when his show opens
at the Flagan Gallery.

118
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,554
Boy, oh, boy.

119
00:08:40,588 --> 00:08:42,590
Gee, I wonder what
made her call now?

120
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,558
I mean, I wonder what
made her invite us, now?

121
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,894
We-We met her over a year ago.

122
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,735
Why... what suddenly made
her decide that we were...

123
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,700
- you know, eligible.
- Eligible?

124
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,602
Maybe...

125
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,837
Maybe it's because
she saw us at the Hamptons.

126
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,708
Oh, man. Were we smart
to spend the summer out there.

127
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:05,913
Ah! "Buena" sera. "Buena" sera.
Is the lamb "senja" tonight?

128
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,848
- Scusi?
- "Senja."

129
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,049
The way the French fix it.

130
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:12,686
The lamb is "poco coto."
The way the Italians fix it.

131
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:17,090
Well, is it rare
the way the Americans like it?

132
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,728
- Rare, signore.
- I'll have the lamb.

133
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,663
Me too and I like
to see the wine list.

134
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,297
No, no, no list.

135
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,299
I bring you
a nice bottle of Barolo.

136
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,937
[scoffs] I happen to want
a Lambrusco.

137
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,640
No Lambrusco.
Barolo.

138
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,342
Well, then be sure
to make it a '65.

139
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:39,346
Ah, '65 is a very bad year, sir.
I bring you '64.

140
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,882
Fresh bastard.

141
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,619
Well, one thing's clear.
We gotta give a big party.

142
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:46,820
Why is that clear?

143
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,724
I-I mean how big a party
do you have in mind?

144
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,194
Ah, about a 100 people.
Sort of a cocktail buffet.

145
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,839
Ah, those crummy
little dinners we used to have

146
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:58,999
don't mean a thing. Hmm-mm.
We're way beyond that now.

147
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,703
Can I have another drink,
Jonathan?

148
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,741
I'm gonna get Beaumont
to do the party.

149
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,843
The man the Willis'
and the Bards' use.

150
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:11,745
But he's so pretentious.

151
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,982
Pretentious, pretentious.
What the hell does that mean?

152
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,684
Just what the dictionary says.

153
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,652
Look, don't start
worrying about it now.

154
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:20,754
Beaumont's booked months ahead.

155
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:23,028
I probably won't be able
to get him until Christmas time.

156
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:25,168
Think you can have
the silver polished

157
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,794

00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,261
maybe come down to New York,
fooled around in the theatre.

315
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:57,196
Shouldn't have blocked my
creativity the way I did.

316
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,433
I'm a very creative
kind of person.

317
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,972
- What do you think of that?
- That's a creation.

318
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:10,677
Mother, you're not going
to wear that outfit, are you?

319
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,379
Tina: What's wrong
with this outfit?

320
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,581
- It shows all your "bos."
- My what?

321
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:19,619
- "Bos," bosoms, you know.
- The word for them is breasts.

322
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,254
I have asked you a 100 times

323
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:23,523
to call things
by their proper names.

324
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,326
- They're disgusting.
- What's disgusting?

325
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,328
The names for things
you want us to use.

326
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,397
Vagina, for God's sake.

327
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,399
Do you think that
poo-poo and poh-poh,

328
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,535
and thing and down there
are nicer?

329
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,471
You mustn't be ashamed
of natural functions.

330
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:40,973
I suppose you think
that's natural outfit?

331
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:44,311
Cut so low, your... breasts
are hanging out?

332
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:45,578
[doorbell buzzes]

333
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,515
That must be Mrs. Prinz.

334
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:54,020
I can't stand Mrs. Prinz.
She smells like a wet dog.

335
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:56,956
Mrs. Prinz.

336
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,991
You're a lucky man, Mr. Balser.

337
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,059
Good night, girls.

338
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,395
Two little daughters,
so full of love, so sweet.

339
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,696
- Bless their hearts.
- Sure.

340
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,732
I have two sons
My sons I never see.

341
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,075
- Uh-huh.
- Not a phone call even.

342
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,436
Why can't my sons make
a phone call once a week?

343
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:10,269
Maybe they could spend a dime

344
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:11,838
to find out
they have a mother...

345
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:12,839
- Uh-huh.
- Living and breathing

346
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:15,342
with my emphysema, yet.
Not dead in the grave.

347
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,810
I don't sleep nights thinking
how cruel my sons are to me.

348
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:20,055
They can stay up until the end
of this program, Mrs. Prinz.

349
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,914
- After that, lights out.
- Uh, Mr. Balser,

350
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,450
before you go, please.

351
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,385
It's a miracle
I didn't break the leg.

352
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,086
I don't sleep nights
from the pain.

353
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,154
- Ah.
- And doctor bills.

354
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:30,490
A poor widow like me
shouldn't have doctor bills

355
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,992
for a crack in the pavement
the city's too rotten to fix.

356
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,428
What I want, Mr. Balser,
is you should be my lawyer

357
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:36,496
and sue the city for me.

358
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:39,766
I don't handle personal
injury cases, Mrs. Prinz.

359
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:42,869
Last Tuesday, broad daylight,

360
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:45,405
on Madison Avenue, in front
of Rockner's stationery store.

361
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:47,350
I'm sorry. You'll have to get
someone else, Mrs. Prinz.

362
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:49,409
- Goodbye, girls.
- Make the city pay me,

363
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:52,044
Mr. Balser.
Fifty thousand dollars.

364
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:53,913
For my pain, Mr. Balser.

365

[whispers] No idea who we are.

367
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,353
How dear of you to come.

368
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,955
How very sweet and dear of you.

369
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,058
And now be good little lambs
and get yourselves a drink.

370
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:07,694
You know everyone here.

371
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,034
Oh, my God!

372
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,336
Did you ever see
so many names in one place?

373
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:19,506
Never.

374
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,408
Isn't it marvelous
that we've developed

375
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,510
such an exciting social life?

376
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:24,644
Marvelous.

377
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,747
Um, uh, look who's there.
That's, um...

378
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,684
It's um... What's his name?
He won the Pulitzer prize.

379

[indistinct chatter]

380
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:49,402
- Who's that?
- Nobody. Balser's wife.

[indistinct chatter]

382
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:13,460
I'm used to paying that sort
of price for something.

383
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:14,661
But it's a lot of money.

384
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:16,529
[indistinct chatter]

385
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,731
Hi there.

386
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:20,567
I'm Tina Balser.

387
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:22,769
We met at Joe Nemlo's party.

388
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,475
You were looking for a...

389
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:31,578
a tall skinny blonde
with green horn rims.

390
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:34,447
Oh, yes.

391
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:37,584
Mrs. Balser.
Samuel Keefer.

392
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,552
- How do you do?
- Hello.

393
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,220
So, I think you ought
to do that, George.

394
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,623
Especially since you're the most
ambitious prick I know.

395
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:45,858
You and I have been friends
for a long time.

396
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:47,627
Samuel: Screw friendship.

397
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:49,596
Excuse me.

398
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:54,701
Charming pair.

399
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,569
[laughter]

400
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:00,707
[indistinct chatter]

401
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,550
Hello.

402
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:14,654
We weren't laughing
at you, you know.

403
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:17,490
- Oh, I didn't think you were.
- Oh, yes, you did.

404
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:19,892
In case you don't know it,
that's pretty looney.

405
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:21,594
Oh, go to hell.

406
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:23,662
What's the matter?

407
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:29,802
- Can't you relax?
- Would you leave me alone?

408
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:33,139
Look, I came all the way over
here to give you a compliment

409
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:35,575
and you act as if
I'm insulting you.

410
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:38,477
- A compliment?
- Yes.

411
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,681
I honestly
didn't recognize you before.

412
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,752
You know, you look like a
totally different woman tonight.

413
00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:48,721
Tell me...

414
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,257
does screwing appeal to you?

415
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,667
What's the matter? You drunk?

416
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:02,969
Just mad.

417
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,305
- Looney, as you said.
- Stand still. Here.

418
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,574
I haven't finished.

419
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,743
- I find this all rather boring.
- You're not bored,

420
00:25:10,777 --> 00:25:14,681
so, cut the crap. As a matter
of fact, you're thawing.

421
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,884
And you're just beginning
to vibrate.

422
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,554
You know, you excite
the hell out of me.

423
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:24,957
And I excite you too, don't I?

424
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,695
Oh, my.

425
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:31,631
Oh, my goodness.

426
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:35,201
Why, this hasn't happened
to me in years.

427
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:39,672
Not since I was
a horny teenager.

428
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:43,843
- You're disgusting.
- Stand right here.

429
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:47,013
We don't want the world
to see how you affect me, do we?

430
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,649
How would you like
to sit on my lap?

431
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:53,285
You are the most
disgusting man I have ever met.

432
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:56,689
- So?
- So nothing, you worm.

433
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:03,596
I noticed you're talking
to George Prager.

434
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:06,265
- Yes.
- Mmm. You see?

435
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,100
That should prove
something to you.

436
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:09,268
What?

437
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,905
I'm damn proud you can hold
your own with someone like that.

438
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,941
What were you talking about?

439
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,610
Sex.

440
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,713
We were talking about sex.

441
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:23,015
Sex?

442
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:24,917
That's right.

443
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:29,188
Hmm-mm. Nothing the matter
with you, Tina.

444
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:31,791
- [Tina sighs]
- I take it all back.

445
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:35,594
If you can banter about sex with
someone like George Prager...

446
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:38,631
you're not as insecure
as I thought.

447
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:42,635
- [telephone rings]
- Tina: Please get that, Lottie?

448
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,905
Lottie: Hello?
Just a moment, please.

449
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:49,676
There's a man who wants
to speak to you, Mrs. Balser.

450
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:51,978
He says to tell you
it's Mr. Prager.

451
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:56,716
Thank you, Lottie.
I'll take it in here.

452
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:09,996
- Hello?
- Hi.

453
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,675
Have you recovered from
my shocking behavior yet?

454
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:14,701
I gave you damn near two weeks.

455
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:16,435
How are you?

456
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,971
Why, I'm just fine,
thank you. How are you?

457
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:20,106
Okay, good. That's over.

458
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,408
Let's get to the point.
Can I see you this afternoon?

459
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,677
Actually,
I'd like to see you right now.

460
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:28,748
You mean you'd take me out
for a drink or... or for lunch?

461
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:31,851
George: [laughs] Oh, Jesus.

462
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:33,753
Oh, really, baby.

463
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:35,688
You expect me
to go through all that?

464
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:39,726
Come on. Come on.
Be a big, brave girl.

465
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,160
Play it clean and straight, huh?

466
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:42,829
Oh, I'm not brave.

467
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:44,663
I'm a coward
through and through.

468
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:48,067
Actually, I'm afraid of about
everything you could name.

469
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,136
Yeah. And I'll name one.

470
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,806
Me.
There's nothing wrong with that.

471
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,743
I find you rather exciting.

472
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:58,945
Well, about you coming over...

473
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:02,081
Um... I...

474
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,210
I have to go to a committee
meeting at my daughter's school.

475
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:08,454
I was just on my way out.

476
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:11,290
Tomorrow. Ah, no.
Tomorrow's Saturday. Monday.

477
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:13,826
Monday I promised Jonathan
I'd go down

478
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,828
and pick out our
Christmas cards for this year.

479
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:16,796
[sighs]

480
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:18,240
Your life is really
full of crap, isn't it?

481
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:19,832
Look, I'm in the telephone book.

482
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:21,433
If you wanna see me,
you call me.

483
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:22,467
[telephone hangs up]

484
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:28,340
Believe me, the girls
are gonna be just fine.

485
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:31,510
In some cases the fever
runs as high as 105.

486
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,345
But there's still nothing
to worry about.

487
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:35,882
The thing just has
to run its course.

488
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:37,884
No antibiotics can touch it.

489
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:42,855
Give them plenty of fluids
and keep 'em warm.

490
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:45,124
And, uh...

491
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:47,760
don't worry if they throw up
a lot in the next few days.

492
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:50,963
You'll just have to rally round
with the old mop and pail.

493
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:53,432
- Will I get it?
- Probably.

494
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,201
This thing is very contagious.

495
00:28:56,202 --> 00:28:58,871
You mean my husband
will get it too?

496
00:28:58,905 --> 00:28:59,905
Tina!

497
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:05,978
Tina!

498
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:16,088
Tine... this damn thing
makes me so thirsty.

499
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:18,858
Get me a glass
of ginger ale, will you?

500
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,759
With lots of cracked ice?

501
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,261
Cracked, not cubes.

502
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,339
If only you would only
go lie down in the living room,

503
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:25,531
I could clean up this mess.

504
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:26,665
Oh, too weak to move.

505
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:29,301
Little while ago you said
you were feeling stronger.

506
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:31,070
I'm having a relapse.

507
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:34,941
- Tine?
- Mmm?

508
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,110
Bring me a Carr's water biscuit,
will you?

509
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:41,914
[TV channel hopping]

510
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:46,886
Darn.

511
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:48,254
Tina!

512
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:52,925
Tina!

513
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:56,195
Goddammit.

514
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:58,264
Tina!

515
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:08,841
Tine... I've got this terrible
craving for a tall lemonade.

516
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:10,576
I'll see if there's a can
in the freezer.

517
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:13,379
But Tine...
I'd rather have fresh lemonade.

518
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:17,016
Make me the real old fashioned
kind, Tine, with...

519
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,551
plenty of cracked ice
and sliced lemons.

520
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,254
Tine?

521
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,591
Put in a touch
of grenadine, will you?

522
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:30,529
[door creaks]

523
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:36,035
You're up.

524
00:30:37,036 --> 00:30:39,305
- You must be feeling better.
- Oh, God, no.

525
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:42,108
I feel perfectly lousy.

526
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:47,980
- What's that you're reading?
- A cook book.

527
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:50,582
- Looking for a turkey stuffing.
- Oh...

528
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,885
Thanksgiving. Oh.

529
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:56,255
- Christ. When's that?
- A week from tomorrow.

530
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:01,627
My brain's been affected
by this thing.

531
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,429
Tina...

532
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:06,532
the invitations to our party
have to out right away.

533
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:07,533
The party's not
for another month.

534
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:09,635
I know, but the kind of people
we're inviting

535
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:12,905
make plans two
and three months ahead of time.

536
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:15,141
We'll be lucky if everybody
isn't all booked up.

537
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:20,112
Would you please do them?
I'd like to help you, but...

538
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:21,981
I really feel rotten.

539
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,316
I feel weak as a kitten.

540
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,587
God...
I have to go back to bed.

541
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:41,033
Tina!

542
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:45,103
Tina!

543
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:50,376
Huh. Tina!

544
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:54,680
Tina!

545
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:01,020
Tin... a!

546
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:08,060
Tine, I've been thinking
about the turkey stuffing.

547
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,531
Maybe you could do
a whole different kind

548
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:14,266
of Thanksgiving dinner
this year.

549
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:18,170
Not that your Thanksgiving
dinners haven't been great.

550
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:21,073
But... it might be fun
to jazz it up.

551
00:32:22,074 --> 00:32:26,378
More... gourmet.
Less classic American, you know?

552
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,115
That's a wonderful idea,
Jonathan.

553
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:31,217
How are you coming
with the invitations?

554
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,119
[sighs]

555

Finished.

556
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:36,188
I'll mail them tomorrow.
No stamps in the house.

557
00:32:37,223 --> 00:32:39,358
Why can't you take 'em
to the post office?

558
00:32:40,026 --> 00:32:41,260
It's awfully cold outside.

559
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,096
For God's sakes, Tina,

560
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,999
the post office is only
four bloody blocks away.

561
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,035
That's true.

562
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:52,104
That's absolutely true.

563
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:57,276
What you say
has a certain ring of truth.

Yes.

00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:17,205
- Tina: Were you working?
- No, I'm not working.

567
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:18,597
Would I answer if I was working?

568
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,699
Oh. This is Tina Balser.

00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:22,468

00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:25,037
Tina Balser.

571
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:29,108
Oh. So, it's you. What's up?
You wanna drink?

572
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:31,610
I thought that might be nice.

573
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:33,145
Hold on a minute.

574
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,820
Look, tomorrow's out. It'll have
to be the day after tomorrow.

575
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,089
Friday at three o' clock.

576
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:46,024
You gonna change your mind?
Chicken out, not show?

577
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:49,128
No.

578
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:51,330
Is this the table
where you work?

579
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:56,335
I mean, well, if it is, what
a wonderful view to inspire you.

580
00:33:57,436 --> 00:33:59,071
Are you working on a new...

581
00:33:59,105 --> 00:34:01,307
article or new book
or something?

582
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:06,178
I never talk
about my work... ever.

583
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:07,779
So, forget it from now on.

584
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:10,516
[sighs]
Now, please, don't start.

585
00:34:11,117 --> 00:34:13,752
- Start what?
- Being impossible.

586
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,222
I am impossible.
Don't you start.

587
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:17,289
Me? Start what?

588
00:34:17,323 --> 00:34:21,093
- Getting all nerved up.
- I am not all nerved up.

589
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,363
You just an... antagonize me.

590
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,233
That isn't exactly
the word for it.

591
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,115
What changed your mind
about coming here?

592
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,684
I, uh...

593
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,256
- I'm not very clear about that.
- Well, it doesn't matter.

594
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,159
Point it, you are here.

595
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:55,561
It's interesting, isn't it?

596
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,297
That's not exactly
the word for it.

597
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,333
You know anything about me?
Aside from my work.

598
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:04,603
Everything they say is true.

599
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:07,673
Well, except for the bit
about my being on stuff.

600
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,476
I was for a while,
but not long enough...

601
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:11,777
to get in any real trouble.

602
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,645
I take it this is
the big warning.

603
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,414
You can skip that.

604
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:17,549
I can take care of myself.

605
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:20,419
Oh, please, don't start
that la-de-da shit with me.

606
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,721
It makes me wanna puke.
Save it for your husband

607
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:24,290
and your charming crew
of friends.

608
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:27,426
[scoffs] This is ridiculous.

609
00:35:28,394 --> 00:35:30,896
- I am going home.
- [screams] Sit down!

610
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,903
- Sit down.
- I can't stay.

611
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:40,472
- You make me too mad.
- You're not mad.

612
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:42,308
You're scared to death.

613
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,281
Goddammit, so am I.

614
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,194
So am I.

615
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:45,484
Baby, you are a terrific
piece of ass.

616
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,654
Are you always that good?

617
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:52,558
No.

618
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:55,160
Hmm.

619
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:00,999
Well, so much
for the compliment.

620
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,569
Now, what the hell do we do?

621
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:06,605
- What do you mean?
- Well...

622
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:08,450
I thought you'd be good
for a couple of screws,

623
00:40:08,474 --> 00:40:09,841
but this could get out of hand.

624
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:15,113
Don't worry.

625
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:19,485
I have no intention
of getting involved with you.

626
00:40:19,518 --> 00:40:20,619
Oh.

627
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:23,589
I am the one who is not
going to get involved with you.

628
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,558
I'm not gonna let a dizzy,
mixed-up broad like you

629
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:27,593
mess me up.

630
00:40:27,626 --> 00:40:29,895
Then there's nothing
to worry about, is there?

631
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,597
Oh, I know your type.

632
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:35,734
For females like you, sex...
particularly great sex...

633
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,536
there's got to be love.

634
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:41,907
I could never love you.
Ever.

635
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:58,456
[sighs]

636
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:04,496
Could you please move a little
so I can get up off this floor?

637
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,231
What for?

638
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:09,635
To get dressed and go home.

639
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:12,938
It's only ten past four.

640
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:15,807
You just got here.

641
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:26,084
Hey.

642
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:27,986
- George, let me go.
- Why?

643
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,555
Cause you already...

644
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,792
You're reliable, aren't you?

645
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,768
Let's see.

646
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:48,774
[chuckling]

647
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,643
Oh, yes, you are.

648
00:41:52,277 --> 00:41:55,814
Alive and kicking.

649
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,885
Tina: Mmm.

650
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:01,720
[Tina giggles]

651
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:05,624
The thing it all hangs on is,

652
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:08,627
can you have a straight
sex thing or not?

653
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,762
It's not gonna be easy for you.

654
00:42:11,797 --> 00:42:13,098
I know your type.

655
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:17,836
You said that before.
What exactly is my type?

656
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,971
Your type is that when you
were a little girl,

657
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:24,876
you brushed your hair 100
strokes every single night.

658
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,012
I always cheated.

659
00:42:27,613 --> 00:42:30,548
And you wore white gloves
and you went to dancing school.

660
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:35,353
And on your tenth birthday,
you're daddy hired a magician

661
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,988
to entertain at your party.

662
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:40,959
And the next summer you went
to camp and fell in love

663
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:43,161
with your dyke riding counselor.

664
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:44,562
Tennis counselor.

665
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:48,900
[laughs] Then you went to some
pukey girls' school, didn't you?

666
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:50,736
And you edited the year book.

667
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:54,272
And then during the summer
and vacation on Nantucket,

668
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,207
you necked your ass off
with a dumb boy

669
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,709
from
Virginia Military Institute.

670
00:42:57,743 --> 00:43:00,679
He was a smart, and from Exeter.

671
00:43:01,146 --> 00:43:02,748
And it was East Hampton.

672
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:05,951
Now, that get-up.

673
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,120
That's your type.

674
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:12,758
Why do you come here looking
as if you're on your way

675
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,860
to a poetry reading
at the Y.M.H.A.?

676
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:17,896
Instead of on my way to commit
adultery on 50th Street.

677
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,766
Really, is that what it is
to you, Mrs. Balser?

678
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:22,600
Certainly not a love affair.

679
00:43:23,735 --> 00:43:25,771
Well, there are,
I believe, other terms.

680
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:29,641
Save 'em...
for your bloody awful books.

681
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:32,310
Hey.

682
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,981
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

683
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:37,716
You take that back.

684
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,622
Okay.

685
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,058
You're good.

686
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:50,628
You're so good...

687
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:52,964
it doesn't bear thinking about.

688
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:56,902
Oh.

689
00:43:58,269 --> 00:43:59,705
Well...

690
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:05,944
Now, you tell me why you came
up here thinking about it.

691
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:10,648
Because then I have to figure
out why George, the writer...

692
00:44:10,882 --> 00:44:13,685
is also George,
the deliberately...

693
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:16,121
coarse and vulgar clod.

694
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:18,790
Oh.

695
00:44:25,864 --> 00:44:29,735
Hey, what do you say we play
this by ear for a while?

696
00:44:31,903 --> 00:44:33,104
Okay.

697
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:37,442
Now... we will not see
each other for say...

698
00:44:37,843 --> 00:44:40,779
mmm, about a week.
And we won't call each other.

699
00:44:43,782 --> 00:44:46,017
Don't give me that smile.
You're gonna wanna call me.

700
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:49,387
Now, let's say we have a date
a week from today.

701
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,321
Same time.

702
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:53,424
During that week
we will think things over.

703
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:55,761
You will think about whether
you can swing this

704
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:58,764
for what it is,
pure and incredible sex.

705
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,167
And I will think about just
what I can or cannot take.

706
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,770
- And what does that mean?
- Well, it means I'm just

707
00:45:04,803 --> 00:45:07,472
not sure wanna cope with all
of your emotional tantrums.

708
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:10,776
- My emotional tantrums?
- You'll be crazy about me.

709
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:13,779
You really are.
All crazy, weak in the knees.

710
00:45:13,812 --> 00:45:14,956
And then you're
gonna have tantrums

711
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,415
and you're gonna throw fits
and you're gonna get upset

712
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:20,285
and possessive
and make demands and scenes.

713
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:22,453
Listen to yourself.
[mumbles]

714
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:25,857
Now, if during this week
you've decided you've kicked it

715
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:27,759
or you don't wanna play
it my way,

716
00:45:27,793 --> 00:45:29,861
you just don't call me
or you don't come.

717
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:32,430
And if, during the week,
I've decided I don't need it,

718
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,065
I'll call you
and tell you not to come

719
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:36,434
or I just will not
be here when you show up.

720
00:45:37,135 --> 00:45:41,506
- All the unmitigated gall.
- Well... what about it?

721
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,143
What do you say?
Deal?

722
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:49,815
- It's a deal.
- Good.

723
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:07,098
Sylvia: Yuck.
Onions before breakfast.

724
00:46:07,132 --> 00:46:10,168
- Couldn't you wait until later?
- Food's in the dining room.

725
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:11,946
You won't be able
to smell anything in there.

726
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:15,573
You can smell the bloody onions
all the way in our bedroom.

727
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,810
That's what woke me up.
What's this?

728
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,146
Something for
the turkey stuffing.

729
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:23,014
It looks mucky. Ugh.

730
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,855
- What's that bloody smell?
- Good morning, Jonathan.

731
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:33,925
God. Are you making
a big production?

732
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:37,062
I am making Thanksgiving dinner.

733
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:40,198
And rather special,
as you requested. Why?

734
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:45,136
I feel as if I'm getting that
goddamn thing all over again.

735
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:48,506
You probably drank
too much last night.

736
00:46:49,107 --> 00:46:51,843
Go back to sleep. You'll feel
better when you wake up.

737
00:46:57,015 --> 00:46:58,283
[shuffling feet]

738
00:47:00,218 --> 00:47:02,520
- Feeling any better?
- Mmm.

739
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:03,922
You look better.

740
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:12,230
Where are the girls?

741
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:15,000
Watching the Thanksgiving parade
with some friends.

742
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:17,235
Oh, great.

743
00:47:17,903 --> 00:47:19,971
It gives us plenty of time.

744
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:23,408
Time?

745
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:26,011
For a little old
roll in the hay.

746
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:30,348
- Now?
- Yeah, of course now.

747
00:47:30,982 --> 00:47:32,450
Honey, you're not feeling well.

748
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:34,019
I feel fine.

749
00:47:34,052 --> 00:47:36,387
I feel pretty horny
as a matter of fact.

750
00:47:36,922 --> 00:47:39,190
You get pretty horny
lying around in bed all day.

751
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:42,260
Well... I'm sorry,
but I...

752
00:47:43,261 --> 00:47:45,030
I really don't feel like it.

753
00:47:45,931 --> 00:47:48,934
I mean, I haven't been
lying around in bed all day.

754
00:47:49,267 --> 00:47:51,336
I've been running around
all day.

755
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:55,206
- And there's a lot left to do.
- [sighs]

756
00:47:55,974 --> 00:47:57,976
And if I don't go turn off the...

757
00:47:58,009 --> 00:48:00,878
Yeah, okay, I get the idea.

758
00:48:03,148 --> 00:48:06,017
Do you think you could at least
bring me something to eat?

759
00:48:07,052 --> 00:48:10,155
- Sure. What would you like?
- Juice and coffee,

760
00:48:10,188 --> 00:48:12,523
one four-minute egg and a scone.
No butter.

761
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:14,325
And some damson plum preserves.

762
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,062
- We're gonna be eating dinner...
- Well, I'm hungry.

763
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:18,596
I haven't eaten all day.

764
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:35,413
My, this is a delicious dinner,
Tine.

765
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:38,283
Isn't this
just scrumptious, girls?

766
00:48:40,685 --> 00:48:43,388
This wine is called
Romanee-Saint-Vivant.

767
00:48:44,055 --> 00:48:45,290
Can you say that?

768
00:48:45,323 --> 00:48:47,925
Both: Romanee-Saint-Vivant.

769
00:48:48,126 --> 00:48:51,229
Good. You must learn
so when you grow up,

770
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,597
you'll know all about wines.

771
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:56,134
No reason why women
shouldn't know as much as men.

772
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:59,437
Expensive for a 1964.

773
00:49:00,138 --> 00:49:04,142
Expensive but not... smug.
You know what I mean?

774
00:49:04,175 --> 00:49:06,277
Liz: This stuffing
tastes different.

775
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:09,580
Why didn't you make the old
kind of stuffing we love?

776
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:13,584
Daddy specifically asked for
something different this year.

777
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:14,986
Didn't you, Jonathan?

778
00:49:15,586 --> 00:49:18,389
I did. And I'm glad I did.

779
00:49:18,423 --> 00:49:21,159
It's great. Super-duper.

780
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:23,294
Always said you had
the makings of a superb cook.

781
00:49:23,328 --> 00:49:26,564
What's in the stuffing?
The squiggly things?

782
00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:29,634
Please don't talk
with your mouth full, Sylvie.

783
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:31,136
Oysters.

784
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:34,111
- [Sylvie coughs]
- Sylvie!

785
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:37,587
Sylvie! What do you mean by
doing such a disgusting thing?

786
00:49:38,043 --> 00:49:39,644
Sylvie! I am talking to you.

787
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:41,479
What was the meaning
of that outrage?

788
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:43,414
Oysters! They make me sick.

789
00:49:43,448 --> 00:49:47,152
- You and Liz just love oysters.
- On the half shell

790
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:50,388
with cocktail sauce. Not in a
bloody turkey, for God's sake.

791
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:53,724
Sylvie, you will apologize
to your mother this instant.

792
00:49:53,758 --> 00:49:55,526
And then you will eat
this delicious dinner

793
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,662
that she has worked
so hard to cook.

794
00:49:57,695 --> 00:49:59,697
Sylvie: [shouts]
It isn't delicious, it's awful.

795
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,300
Mushy chestnuts, onion
and celery and cream.

796
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:05,736
Even the salad isn't normal.
Oranges and cut up plants.

797
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:07,638
You go straight to your room.

798
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:10,141
I'm happy to go to my room.

799
00:50:17,582 --> 00:50:19,117
I feel rather peculiar.

800
00:50:28,293 --> 00:50:29,360
[sighs]

801
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:35,133
[telephone rings]

802
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:41,106
Elliott here, Jonathan.
How are you?

803
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:44,175
Jonathan: Elly, old boy.
How are you?

804
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:47,212
- Have a pleasant Thanksgiving?
- Elliot: Splendid, and you?

805
00:50:47,245 --> 00:50:49,114
Jonathan: Perfect.
Couldn't have been better.

806
00:50:49,147 --> 00:50:51,092
Elliott: I'm awfully sorry
to bother you on a holiday,

807
00:50:51,116 --> 00:50:54,252
but, uh, we're having a little
financial meeting here.

808
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:56,821
- Are you free to join us?
- Jonathan: Of course.

809
00:50:56,854 --> 00:50:59,324
I'd love to.
Be over in ten minutes.

810
00:51:09,267 --> 00:51:10,368
What was that?

811
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:13,104
Tina: What was what?

812
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:18,075
- That awful crash.
- I dropped a plate.

813
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,180
Didn't sound like a plate.

814
00:51:26,717 --> 00:51:29,320
- Why are you going out?
- You ought to know.

815
00:51:29,354 --> 00:51:31,189
You were listening
on the extension.

816
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:34,759
Why does Mr. Asher want you
for a financial meeting?

817
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:37,728
Because I'm gonna be one of
the major investors

818
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:39,230
in his new vineyard.

819
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:42,267
How much?

820
00:51:46,171 --> 00:51:48,306
Who do you think you are,
cross examining me?

821
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:50,308
How much are you investing,
Jonathan?

822
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:52,677
I don't like
being cross examined.

823
00:51:53,578 --> 00:51:56,881
And I don't like being spied on
on the telephone.

824
00:52:00,218 --> 00:52:02,653
How can we afford
to invest in a vineyard?

825
00:52:03,288 --> 00:52:06,224
I'm in charge of
financial matters around here.

826
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:14,299
So you can take
that snippy tone of voice

827
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:17,168
and do "you know what"
with it, old girl.

828
00:52:19,337 --> 00:52:22,440
And since you've had
such an exhausting day...

829
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:26,311
I suggest that you
just go to bed.

830
00:52:26,544 --> 00:52:27,845
And relax.

831
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:35,386
[sighing]

832
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,195
Well...

833
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:46,597
we're hooked.

834
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:50,235
At least for a while, anyway.

835
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:53,471
Mmm.

836
00:52:55,406 --> 00:52:56,607
Who taught you all that?

837
00:52:58,276 --> 00:52:59,510
[sighing]

838
00:53:03,314 --> 00:53:04,549
Oh.

839
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,952
Marvelous hands.

840
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,323
Incredible hands.

841
00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:15,460
He didn't teach you all that.

842
00:53:17,328 --> 00:53:18,263
Who?

843
00:53:18,296 --> 00:53:20,398
That goofed up husband of yours.

844
00:53:23,268 --> 00:53:25,670
You screw around a lot
before you married him?

845
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:28,673
Not a lot.

846
00:53:29,674 --> 00:53:31,509
Well, what's his problem,
anyway?

847
00:53:34,812 --> 00:53:35,980
I gather you don't know it,

848
00:53:36,013 --> 00:53:38,316
but he happens to be
a brilliant lawyer.

849
00:53:41,452 --> 00:53:44,255
Well, is he likely
to get wise to this?

850
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:47,925
No, he doesn't watch me.

851
00:53:48,793 --> 00:53:52,430
He's a... little too involved
with himself right now.

852
00:53:52,463 --> 00:53:55,500
Well, he probably has
a broad somewhere.

853
00:53:57,302 --> 00:53:58,403
Mmm, no.

854
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:01,339
He isn't the type.

855
00:54:01,372 --> 00:54:04,442
Oh, everybody is the type,
pussycat.

856
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:05,443
Well, did you...

857
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:07,978
just screw around a lot
since you married him?

858
00:54:11,716 --> 00:54:12,717
Never before.

859
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:15,653
Really?

860
00:54:16,721 --> 00:54:18,956
Well, what took you so long?

861
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:22,727
Um...

862
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:27,498
I believed in all those
square virtues.

863
00:54:28,566 --> 00:54:30,501
Fidelity and loyalty.

864
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:33,304
- Nothing, you'd understand.
- Mmm.

865
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:36,574
Yeah. Now tell me
the real reason.

866
00:54:36,974 --> 00:54:38,476
That is the real reason.

867
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:43,581
And besides,
sex isn't that important to me.

868
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,015
[chuckling]

869
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:48,819
No, it really isn't.

870
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:51,389
Oh, my sweet fish.

871
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:53,624
My sweet fish.

872
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:58,663
You do not act like a broad
to whom sex is not important.

873
00:55:00,565 --> 00:55:01,666
Who broke you in?

874
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:07,505
Come on. Tell me.
What was he like?

875
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:09,807
I dig hearing about
that sort of thing.

876
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,075
Voyeur.

877
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:14,612
Oh, don't give me any crap about
being a voyeur. I am a voyeur.

878
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,046
- [growls]
- [chuckles]

879
00:55:20,451 --> 00:55:21,552
Well...

880
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:26,624
there wasn't anybody...
like that.

881
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:29,360
- [sighs]
- [laughs]

882
00:55:31,462 --> 00:55:33,464
And besides,
there doesn't have to be.

883
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:37,568
With... some women...

884
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:40,070
sex is just...

885
00:55:41,606 --> 00:55:42,607
instinctive.

886
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:46,611
Remember what Proust
told about Albertine?

887
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,479
She...

888
00:55:50,715 --> 00:55:52,349
instinctively knew...

889
00:55:53,618 --> 00:55:55,786
what would give
the male body pleasure.

890
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:00,057
She... what?

891
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:03,428
She instinctively knew
what would give the male...

892
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:04,695
[laughing]

893
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:11,602
Oh, George,
please don't laugh at me.

894
00:56:11,636 --> 00:56:13,103
Oh, Jesus.

895
00:56:13,638 --> 00:56:15,773
My funny baby.

896
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:17,742
[laughing]
[clapping]

897
00:56:21,145 --> 00:56:24,114
"Albertine
instinctively knew..."

898
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:29,420
Oh, my God. My God, you
are too much. You knucklehead.

899
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,658
Proust was a homosexual
and Albertine was a goddamn boy.

900
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:37,662
Well, I don't happen
to believe in that theory.

901
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:41,566
I happen to believe that
the character of Albertine

902
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,068
- was based on a real woman.
- And who taught you that?

903
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:46,571
Some crappy professor
at Sarah Lawrence?

904
00:56:46,604 --> 00:56:49,774
- Smith.
- Oh. Hey. Hey.

905
00:56:51,509 --> 00:56:54,411
Hey. Hey, sweetheart.

906
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:56,747
Oh, sweetheart cookie.

907
00:56:57,548 --> 00:56:58,668
You really are a smart dame,

908
00:56:59,817 --> 00:57:01,495
but sometimes you've got a box
full of marbles for a brain.

909
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:02,796
And you're a mean,
cruel bastard.

910
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,523
And you manage to spoil
just about everything.

911
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:13,598
My Christmas list.

912
00:57:13,631 --> 00:57:15,533
The ones that can't
be covered by cash

913
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:18,135
and the ones that require
the personal touch

914
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:20,538
of a little present
besides cash.

915
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:23,941
You'll notice that I put down
suggestions after each name,

916
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:25,676
with a sort of price ceiling.

917
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:28,646
In some cases,
I've even indicated stores.

918
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:30,715
Lord & Taylor is nice for boots

919
00:57:30,748 --> 00:57:33,518
and I happen to know
Ms. Newby needs a pair.

920
00:57:33,551 --> 00:57:37,154
Fleece-lined suede will be nice,
I think, as I've suggested.

921
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:38,756
I've even put down her size.

922
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:41,225
I take it you want me
to do your Christmas shopping?

923
00:57:41,258 --> 00:57:44,562
Yes, I do.
I haven't any time this year.

924
00:57:44,595 --> 00:57:46,897
By the way,
how are the RSVP's coming in?

925
00:57:47,632 --> 00:57:49,734
Everyone's answered,
except seven or eight.

926
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:53,270
Uh-huh. What about Charlotte
Rady and Julie Hayes

927
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,172
and the Packards?
They all accept?

928
00:57:55,606 --> 00:57:57,642
Charlotte Rady
and Julie Hayes did,

929
00:57:57,675 --> 00:57:58,885
Joyce Packard called
this morning

930
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,511
and said she couldn't come.

931
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,714
I'm very sorry to hear that.

932
00:58:04,782 --> 00:58:08,252
Very, very sorry.
Did she give any reason?

933
00:58:08,285 --> 00:58:10,555
They're off
to some place to ski.

934
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:12,657
Klosters or Kitzbuhel.

935
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:15,492
Boy, some people really know
how to live, don't they?

936
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:18,529
I hope you've arranged to have
the apartment done next week.

937
00:58:18,563 --> 00:58:20,731
Uh, floors waxed,
windows washed.

938
00:58:20,765 --> 00:58:22,633
You've ordered the flowers,
haven't you?

939
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:25,702
Not yet.

940
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:30,908
Not yet?

941
00:58:31,642 --> 00:58:35,613
Do you realize our party
is only nine days away?

942
00:58:38,082 --> 00:58:39,617
[door slams]

943
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:55,600
I wanna have a talk with you.

944
00:58:58,736 --> 00:58:59,870
About what?

945
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:03,941
Do you know what tobacco
does to your teeth?

946
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:07,277
Stains them.

the way we live.

951
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,927

realize my creative potential,

955
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:39,276
you are doing everything
to hold me back?

956
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:45,716
What if I happen to think that
some of your methods are wrong?

957
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:49,286

for so-called celebrities...

959
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:54,091
running after them.

960
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:56,927
I think it's idiotic
and demeaning.

961
00:59:57,828 --> 01:00:01,766
They don't care about you.
They wanna use you.

962
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:03,934
Why don't you just let me
be the judge of that.

963
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:06,771
Why? Why can't you
go along with me

964
01:00:06,804 --> 01:00:08,605
instead of working
to destroy me?

965
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:13,410
Wanna know the truth? I'm more
worried about the girls.

966
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:16,413
What the hell do you mean
by that crack?

967
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:19,750
Girls look to their mothers
to learn how to be women...

968
01:00:21,018 --> 01:00:23,754
and you sure set
one hell of a horrible example.

969
01:00:23,788 --> 01:00:26,223
Well, listen here,
Jonathan Balser,

970
01:00:26,256 --> 01:00:29,193
if there's any rotten example
being set, for those girls,

971
01:00:29,226 --> 01:00:30,460
it is not me.

972
01:00:30,494 --> 01:00:33,731
So you take that kind of talk
and shove it right up your ass.

973
01:00:33,764 --> 01:00:36,801
You calm down. Calm down.
Stop using such foul language.

974
01:00:36,834 --> 01:00:38,302
I'm gonna pretend
that you never said

975
01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:39,970
any of the nasty
things you just said.

976
01:00:40,004 --> 01:00:43,240
Well, that is very big
of you, I must say.

977
01:00:43,273 --> 01:00:44,975
I have been patient...

978
01:00:45,442 --> 01:00:48,212
I have been
fantastically patient...

979
01:00:48,245 --> 01:00:50,948
more patient
than any other man I know.

980
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:54,118
But I am at my wit's end.
I don't know what to do.

981
01:00:54,752 --> 01:00:56,086
About what?

982
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:00,390
In nine days we are giving
a party for 100 people.

983
01:01:01,091 --> 01:01:04,695
I have hired Beaumont, the most
expensive caterer in New York,

984
01:01:04,729 --> 01:01:07,998
to handle the food
and the service. Even the ice.

985
01:01:08,766 --> 01:01:12,002
I would like to see you
do one thing

986
01:01:12,036 --> 01:01:13,904
to make this party a success.

987

a week from Saturday...

a safe way of inviting you?

990
01:01:26,984 --> 01:01:28,452
Not on your life.

991
01:01:31,822 --> 01:01:32,923
Why?

992
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:36,794
First of all,
I don't dig parties.

993
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:39,797
I hate them.
And second of all,

994
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:42,699
I do not get my kicks
from that sort of thing.

995
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:46,003
What sort of thing?

996
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:48,773
That "nobody-knows-but-us" crap.

I might have known you'd take
that kind of cheap thrill.

999
01:01:56,881 --> 01:01:58,415
I only asked you

1000
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:01,151
because it would be
more bearable if you were there.

1001
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:06,891
If you hate parties so much,

1002
01:02:06,924 --> 01:02:09,259
what were you doing
at the do where we met?

The tall, skinny blonde.

1005

Oh, what difference
does it make who it was?

1006
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:20,838
Oh... it sounds as if you...

cared for her.

No, I don't give a shit why.

1047

Well, one of the reasons
is that damn party we're having.

1048

Interesting things like that.

And then... And then Friday,
I have to go to the dentist

1051
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,918
- and to the hairdresser.
- Yeah.

1052
01:04:47,952 --> 01:04:50,254
Next week I could see you
early in the week.

01:09:24,728 --> 01:09:28,632
over that Destin Company lady
lingerie you're always wearing.

1102
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:30,267
Oh, shut up.

1103
01:09:30,534 --> 01:09:31,568
You shut up.

1104
01:09:36,373 --> 01:09:37,641
- Come here.
- No.

1105
01:09:40,444 --> 01:09:41,611
It's...

1106
01:09:42,812 --> 01:09:44,414
too cold.

1107
01:09:50,254 --> 01:09:53,189
That's not bad.
That's not bad at all.

1108
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:56,360
It's a lot better than walking
around in a dirty old raincoat.

1109
01:09:56,393 --> 01:09:57,527
Mmm.

1110
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:02,232
Well, that's it.
Christmas is over.

1111
01:10:02,266 --> 01:10:04,968
I was a good little boy
and Santa Claus came.

1112
01:10:05,469 --> 01:10:06,670
Didn't you?

1113
01:10:08,272 --> 01:10:10,307
What are you gonna do
on Christmas?

1114
01:10:11,741 --> 01:10:12,942
Why?

1115
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:16,446
What should I be doing?
What are you doing?

1116
01:10:17,314 --> 01:10:19,816
Tell me, how is the birthday
of our Lord celebrated

1117
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:22,952
in the warm and loving
Balser household?

1118
01:10:24,688 --> 01:10:25,955
[telephone rings]

1119
01:10:33,663 --> 01:10:35,399
Answer the telephone.

1120
01:10:38,535 --> 01:10:40,404
Answer the goddamn phone.

1121
01:10:44,808 --> 01:10:46,376
Okay.

1122
01:10:51,715 --> 01:10:53,249
Hello.

1123
01:10:54,718 --> 01:10:55,952
No, I was taking a shower.

1124
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:57,721
Because I felt like it.
That's why.

1125
01:10:59,489 --> 01:11:02,326
Will you get off that
stupid kick, for Christ's sake?

1126
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:04,260
No, that's too early.

1127
01:11:07,464 --> 01:11:08,464
[sighs]

1128
01:11:09,433 --> 01:11:10,967
I thought I told you
to knock it off.

1129
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,569
I'll be there
about eight o' clock.

1130
01:11:13,803 --> 01:11:15,038
[hangs up]

1131
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:26,616
It was agreed that you have
no damn right to be jealous.

1132
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:28,752
- I am not jealous.
- What?

1133
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:31,755
I'm not jealous.
I just feel sick.

1134
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:33,523
Why? You asked for it.

1135
01:11:33,557 --> 01:11:36,326
You begged for it. You ordered
me to answer the phone.

1136
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,462
How come
it was plugged in today?

1137
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:40,364
Afraid you'd miss that call?

1138
01:11:40,397 --> 01:11:43,500
Oh, Christ, here comes
the big agony scene.

1139
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:46,436
I'm not even sure
you bought that chemise for me.

1140
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:50,640
- Well, it fit you, didn't it?
- It could fit any number of...

1141
01:11:50,674 --> 01:11:52,108
- broads.
- Oh, please.

1142
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,611
What are you trying to prove?
That I'm a rat? A bastard?

1143
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:56,746
You know that.
That's why you come here.

1144
01:11:56,780 --> 01:12:00,417
- It's what turns you on.
- Sometimes it turns me on.

1145
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:02,852
Sometimes it makes me
wanna throw up.

1146
01:12:02,886 --> 01:12:04,354
Everything has its price.

1147
01:12:05,755 --> 01:12:06,790
I know.

1148
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:08,858
I'm not sure I can pay it.

1149
01:12:08,892 --> 01:12:11,795
Well, can you or can't you?
If you can't, get off the pot.

1150
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:14,540
You're trying to confuse things,
as I knew you would.

1151
01:12:14,564 --> 01:12:15,675
All this jazz about presents.

1152
01:12:15,699 --> 01:12:18,435
What the hell has presents
got to do with you and me?

1153
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:20,437
Jesus, I must be out of my mind.

1154
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:25,141
Anytime you show signs
of being human, I'll think

1155
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,711
- you're out of your mind.
- I'm not human.

1156
01:12:27,744 --> 01:12:29,379
Sentimental.

1157
01:12:29,413 --> 01:12:31,715
We happen to have
a fantastic sex thing.

1158
01:12:31,748 --> 01:12:32,849
Sex is sex.

1159
01:12:33,417 --> 01:12:34,884
A lay is a lay is a lay.

1160
01:12:35,485 --> 01:12:38,488
You wanna get laid, you come
here and you get royally laid.

1161
01:12:38,522 --> 01:12:39,423
Isn't that enough?

1162
01:12:39,456 --> 01:12:41,425
No why the hell
do you have to dress it up

1163
01:12:41,458 --> 01:12:43,460
with a lot of schmultz
and trimmings?

1164
01:12:43,493 --> 01:12:46,062
If that's what you want,
go find yourself some nice

1165
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:47,497
guilty type
of adulteress husband

1166
01:12:47,531 --> 01:12:49,999
in that select social
set you travel in.

1167
01:12:50,534 --> 01:12:52,736
They're past masters
at that sort of crap.

1168
01:12:55,539 --> 01:12:59,476
You don't need a woman.
You need a sex machine.

1169
01:12:59,509 --> 01:13:01,845
Well, it sure would save one
hell of a lot of trouble.

1170
01:13:02,979 --> 01:13:04,414
Merry Christmas!

1171
01:13:05,582 --> 01:13:08,184
Madame Balser?
Beaumont service, Madame.

1172
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:11,555
Ah! Monsieur Beaumont,
a pleasure to meet you at last.

1173
01:13:11,588 --> 01:13:14,157
I'm not Monsieur Beaumont.
I'm Monsieur Henri.

1174
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:17,561
Oh.
How do you do, Henri?

1175
01:13:17,594 --> 01:13:19,563
What time does
Monsieur Beaumont arrive?

1176
01:13:19,596 --> 01:13:22,499
Monsieur Beaumont does not
arrive, Monsieur Balser.

1177
01:13:22,532 --> 01:13:26,470
Please, is there somewhere my
people can change their clothes?

1178
01:13:26,803 --> 01:13:27,871
Doesn't arrive?

1179
01:13:29,072 --> 01:13:31,808
You mean, not come at all?
I'm afraid I don't understand.

1180
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:34,844
Monsieur Beaumont only appears
at those parties

1181
01:13:34,878 --> 01:13:36,145
where the, uh...

1182
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:39,516
necessary arrangements
have been made.

1183
01:13:39,849 --> 01:13:41,117
Well, I...

1184
01:13:42,018 --> 01:13:43,787
This should have
been made clear to me.

1185
01:13:44,788 --> 01:13:47,090
I wasn't told that one had
to make special arrangements

1186
01:13:47,123 --> 01:13:49,192
to have
Monsieur Beaumont appear.

1187
01:13:51,561 --> 01:13:53,463
Bloody upsetting.

1188
01:13:53,863 --> 01:13:56,766
- Does it really matter?
- Goddamn right it matters.

1189
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,602
I'm paying enough for Beaumont
to come here

1190
01:13:58,635 --> 01:14:00,637
and show his bloody face.
He could've told me.

1191
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:02,872
You've got your
hell of a goddamn nerve.

1192
01:14:02,906 --> 01:14:05,842
Now how the hell are me and my
wife supposed to get in and out

1193
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:09,045
- of our front door, huh?
- What's the trouble, Mr. Meyer?

1194
01:14:09,078 --> 01:14:10,790
Trouble? I said
you got your hell of a nerve

1195
01:14:10,814 --> 01:14:13,717
putting these lousy
coat racks in the hall.

1196
01:14:14,884 --> 01:14:17,129
I'm terribly sorry, but you see,
we're having a big party...

1197
01:14:17,153 --> 01:14:18,664
I don't care if you're having
the last supper.

1198
01:14:18,688 --> 01:14:21,625
These lousy coatracks
are blocking my front door.

1199
01:14:21,658 --> 01:14:25,194
How the hell are our friends
supposed to get into our house?

1200
01:14:25,228 --> 01:14:28,665
- I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Meyer.
- I tell you something.

1201
01:14:28,698 --> 01:14:30,610
I wouldn't have come
over here and made this fuss,

1202
01:14:30,634 --> 01:14:32,936
if it wasn't for
that husband of yours.

1203
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:35,905
If that husband of yours
hadn't rung my bell last week

1204
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:40,777
and asked... No, no, no.
He told me to get a new doormat.

1205
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:44,648
That husband of yours said
that my doormat is an eyesore.

1206
01:14:44,681 --> 01:14:47,050
That's exactly the word he used.
Eyesore!

1207
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:51,287
Then he had the nerve to ask me
to take in my umbrella stand.

1208
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,890
That is an imported
umbrella stand.

1209
01:14:53,923 --> 01:14:55,759
I mean, he's got
his goddamn nerve.

1210
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:58,728
Just who the hell does he think
he is, that husband of yours?

1211
01:15:00,263 --> 01:15:02,231
Can't you wait
until the party begins?

1212
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,734
The party has begun.

1213
01:15:04,768 --> 01:15:06,903
Sylvie: Mother, mother.

1214
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:08,872
Why? What's the matter?

1215
01:15:08,905 --> 01:15:12,141
We went into the pantry and
there were platters of canapes

1216
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:13,577
and we were going
to take one each

1217
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:15,679
and a tall man said
if we touched anything,

1218
01:15:15,712 --> 01:15:17,180
he'd lock us in our rooms.

1219
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:18,658
Well, I just better
straighten him out.

1220
01:15:18,682 --> 01:15:20,950
Tina, don't you dare
go in there.

1221
01:15:20,984 --> 01:15:22,218
Monsieur Henri is right.

1222
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:25,722
These people are professionals.
These people are perfectionists.

1223
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:28,000
If Monsieur Henri doesn't want
you two girls under his feet,

1224
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:31,227
spoiling all their hard work,
then you listen to him.

1225
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:34,163
- Can't we just have one canape?
- Please?

1226
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:35,732
That's up to Monsieur Henri.

1227
01:15:35,765 --> 01:15:37,300
Why is it up to Monsieur Henri?

1228
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:38,201
Because he's in charge here.

1229
01:15:38,234 --> 01:15:40,770
He's in charge here?
This is our party.

1230
01:15:40,804 --> 01:15:42,005
My party!

1231
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:45,341
My party! You haven't lifted
one finger for this party.

1232
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:50,179
Monsieur Henri is
an employee in this house!

1233
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:53,349
If I wanna serve
canapes to Lulu,

1234
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,985
that's who he'll serve
canapes to.

1235
01:15:59,823 --> 01:16:02,091
You're mother's very funny,
isn't she, girls?

1236
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:03,259
[Jonathan laughs]

1237
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:05,128
You heard her.
You heard what she said.

1238
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:07,130
Your mother wants
to have a poodle party

1239
01:16:07,163 --> 01:16:09,733
instead of a people party.
[laughs]

1240
01:16:11,034 --> 01:16:14,003
Oh, mother, a poodle party!

1241
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:16,706
You lousy bastard.

1242
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:19,709
All right now. Come on.
You two go watch television.

1243
01:16:19,743 --> 01:16:21,611
Go on now. Hurry up. Hurry up.

1244
01:16:21,645 --> 01:16:23,613
Don't care what you say
in front of them, do you?

1245
01:16:23,647 --> 01:16:26,315
Making my own daughters
laugh at me?

1246
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,952
As usual,
you've got everything twisted.

1247
01:16:29,385 --> 01:16:32,388
You let them see
that you find me ridiculous.

1248
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,924
You encourage them
to find me ridiculous!

1249
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:36,726
What have I got twisted?!

1250
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:39,863
Oh, why do you have
to overreact to everything?

1251
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:43,299
What have I got twisted?!

1252
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:45,735
What has she got twisted,

Man: reaching for
these drinks.

1256
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:04,220
Man: Get me two J&B's, just
a touch of water and some lemon.

1257
01:17:04,253 --> 01:17:05,254
Okay? Thank you.

1258
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:07,532
Man: Oh, look. Don't run away.
I wanna talk to you.

1259
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:10,660
Man: Mark, how are you? Good
to see you. Merry Christmas.

1260
01:17:14,263 --> 01:17:15,775
Man: What are you getting
for Christmas?

1261
01:17:15,799 --> 01:17:20,203
Man: Beer please and a
double vodka and tonic.

1262
01:17:20,236 --> 01:17:21,971
Man: Yes, yes. Absolutely.

01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:24,140
Woman: Can you get that, please?

1264
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:26,910
Man: Seriously,
I couldn't stand it.

1265
01:17:26,943 --> 01:17:29,278
Divine party, angel.

1266
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:31,414
I see you're using
Beaumont's people.

1267
01:17:31,447 --> 01:17:33,016
You should have called me.

1268
01:17:33,049 --> 01:17:35,251
I would have told you about
this other new person

1269
01:17:35,284 --> 01:17:37,286
who is simply marvelous.

1270
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,188
Everybody in the world
used Beaumont

1271
01:17:39,222 --> 01:17:40,857
in these last couple of years.

1272
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:42,926
Those omelets of his
have had it.

1273
01:17:44,093 --> 01:17:47,196
That's what we're having.
Omelets.

1274
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:49,799
Oh, dear,
I've said something wrong.

1275
01:17:49,833 --> 01:17:51,801
I just meant
that if you called me,

1276
01:17:51,835 --> 01:17:53,903
I could have
given you some advice.

1277
01:17:55,872 --> 01:17:58,842
I do have some advice
for you, angel.

1278
01:17:58,875 --> 01:18:00,043
About something else.

1279
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:05,749
Do you remember in Shakespeare
what Iago said to the Moor?

1280
01:18:05,782 --> 01:18:08,885
Look to your wife.
Observe her well.

1281
01:18:09,886 --> 01:18:13,056
Only you must switch
the sexes around, Tina, dear.

1282
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:15,925
Why, Charlotte...

1283
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:19,829
I didn't know
that you'd done the classics.

1284
01:18:20,463 --> 01:18:22,031
I thought you
got into the movies

1285
01:18:22,065 --> 01:18:24,968
because you were
Maddy Gordon's favorite hooker.

1286
01:18:26,469 --> 01:18:28,805
Rotten little bitch.

1287

- Henri shut down the big bar.
- I know.

1288
01:18:39,883 --> 01:18:42,786
It's much too early.
People wanna drink,

1289
01:18:42,819 --> 01:18:44,988
- not think about food.
- I know.

1290
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:48,224
Stop him.
Make him re-open the bar.

1291
01:18:48,257 --> 01:18:50,359
I've already asked him to.

1292
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:52,896
He says he has
another party to do tonight

1293
01:18:52,929 --> 01:18:55,932
and if we want food at all,
it has to be now.

1294
01:18:55,965 --> 01:18:59,468
And if we don't want it,
we have to pay for it anyway.

1295
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,471
Oh, God.

1296
01:19:05,975 --> 01:19:08,144
Oh, is the bar
shut down here, too?

1297
01:19:08,177 --> 01:19:09,879
Sit down, honey.
You with anyone?

1298
01:19:09,913 --> 01:19:10,990
We'll never get
a table at Elaine's.

1299
01:19:11,014 --> 01:19:13,549
I wanna go to Elaine's.
I think George'll be there.

1300
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,260
Girl: How do you know
George will be there?

1301
01:19:15,284 --> 01:19:16,920
- George?
- I wanna dance.

1302
01:19:16,953 --> 01:19:18,888
Let's go somewhere
where we can get some chow

1303
01:19:18,922 --> 01:19:20,800
and then let's get some
place where we can dance.

1304
01:19:20,824 --> 01:19:23,860
I wanna know how you know where
George is having dinner tonight?

1305
01:19:23,893 --> 01:19:25,895
- George who?
- Why don't we have

1306
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:28,464
a fast omelet here and then
go some place to dance?

1307
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:31,134
I don't want
any crap omelet, that's why.

1308
01:19:31,467 --> 01:19:33,402
Let's go, everybody. Come on.

1309
01:19:33,436 --> 01:19:36,405
Come on, honey.

Beaumont's people certainly
left this place in good shape

1312
01:20:42,371 --> 01:20:43,572
you gotta say that.

1313
01:20:43,606 --> 01:20:46,943
Beaumont's people certainly
left this place in good shape.

1314
01:20:47,143 --> 01:20:49,378
I mean, you can't even tell
there's been a party here.

1315
01:20:49,913 --> 01:20:51,847
Has there been a party here?

1316
01:20:52,916 --> 01:20:55,985
By the way, what the hell
did you say to Charlotte Rady?

1317
01:20:56,019 --> 01:20:57,930
Saw the two of you talking,
the next thing I know,

1318
01:20:57,954 --> 01:20:59,422
she was charging
out the front door.

1319
01:21:00,156 --> 01:21:03,026
What makes you think
I had anything to do with it?

1320
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:05,028
Maybe she was bored.

1321
01:21:06,162 --> 01:21:08,898
Maybe there weren't
enough celebrities.

1322
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,938
Or maybe she just
needed another fix.

1323
01:21:16,072 --> 01:21:19,943
Well... on the whole, I think
everything went quite well.

1324
01:21:25,114 --> 01:21:26,114
Don't you?

1325
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:30,019
How much did it cost?

1326

What the hell difference
does it make how much it cost?

1327

I'll be it cost over $1,000.

didn't have to lift a finger.

those omelets so early.

1330

But most people were damned
happy to see those omelets.

1331

At quarter past nine,
there were 13 people here.

- I counted them.
- God, I might have known.

down everything.

you're giving something the axe.

put it in his pocket.

the bloody hell didn't you

1341
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:25,541
march right over there
and get it back?

I don't know.

1350
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:57,073
Well, it's the way you acted
when I came in today.

1351
01:22:57,106 --> 01:22:59,975
- Why? How did I act?
- Oh.

1352
01:23:00,543 --> 01:23:01,577
So...

1353
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:03,746
So casual, as if it hasn't been
almost three weeks

1354
01:23:03,779 --> 01:23:06,182
- since you've seen me.
- What did you expect?

1355
01:23:06,215 --> 01:23:07,450
Crescendo violin?

1356
01:23:16,192 --> 01:23:17,993
What's the matter?
Why are you crying?

1357
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:24,067
Why are you crying?

1358
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:26,335
Maybe it's because
I realized today...

1359
01:23:26,369 --> 01:23:29,372
that you never wanna know
a damn thing about me.

1360
01:23:30,139 --> 01:23:33,242
Do you know that you don't
even know the names of my girls?

1361
01:23:33,276 --> 01:23:36,412
You don't even give a goddamn
about anything about me.

1362
01:23:36,445 --> 01:23:37,680
Oh, Christ.

Cut out the waterworks,
will you?

01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:14,083
Hurry up, love.

1365
01:24:14,117 --> 01:24:17,120
I don't mean to be brisk,
but you can't stay long today.

1366
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:20,089
I'm not planning
on staying long.

1367
01:24:28,231 --> 01:24:29,498
Listen, uh, baby...

1368
01:24:29,832 --> 01:24:31,543
one of the reasons
I let you come here today

1369
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:34,069
- was because I, um...
- "Let me come here today"?

1370
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:38,274
Yes. I let you come in today.

1371
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:40,809
One of the reasons was I...

1372
01:24:40,843 --> 01:24:42,678
wanted to say
what I have to say in person.

1373
01:24:42,711 --> 01:24:44,113
You'd have gotten it all wrong

1374
01:24:44,147 --> 01:24:45,514
if I'd have said it
on the phone.

1375
01:24:46,482 --> 01:24:48,451
I decided we ought
to cool this for a while.

1376
01:24:48,484 --> 01:24:52,221
- You... you're tired of me.
- No, because I'm tired.

1377
01:24:52,255 --> 01:24:54,123
I had three hours
sleep last night

1378
01:24:54,157 --> 01:24:56,425
and I work like
a son of a bitch day and night.

1379
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,528
When I work,
I work like a maniac.

1380
01:25:00,263 --> 01:25:02,465
I can't work like that
and do other things.

1381
01:25:03,566 --> 01:25:07,570
Contrary to what I like
to think, I'm not Superman.

1382
01:25:12,208 --> 01:25:15,778
- What do you mean by cool this?
- Let things ride for a while.

1383
01:25:15,811 --> 01:25:17,680
Say a few weeks and then...

1384
01:25:17,713 --> 01:25:20,183
when things let up,
I'll give you a call.

1385
01:25:21,417 --> 01:25:22,851
When what things let up?

1386
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:26,389
Look, uh, I don't ask you
to account to me.

1387
01:25:27,223 --> 01:25:28,463
Is it something you're writing?

1388
01:25:31,694 --> 01:25:33,229
Please tell me.

1389
01:25:34,197 --> 01:25:36,199
Did you start something
over Christmas?

1390
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,767
I know you don't talk
about your work,

1391
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:40,936
but you can tell me
that much, can't you?

1392
01:25:44,807 --> 01:25:47,276
Or is it...
screwing around

1393
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:50,679
with some other broad
that's made you so puking tired.

1394
01:25:50,713 --> 01:25:54,583
Oh, whammy. Now we have got
a full dressed tantrum going on.

1395
01:25:54,617 --> 01:25:58,321
- You animal. I hate your guts.
- Oh, boy. The works.

1396
01:25:58,354 --> 01:26:00,923
How can I ever
let any part of me touch you?

1397
01:26:00,956 --> 01:26:02,791
Not what you were whimpering
a half hour ago.

1398
01:26:02,825 --> 01:26:04,627
Oh, you rotten,
sadistic son of a bitch.

1399
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:07,363
In case you don't know it, baby,
that's exactly what you did.

1400
01:26:07,396 --> 01:26:10,266
That's what turns you on,
what makes our sex so fantastic.

1401
01:26:10,299 --> 01:26:11,900
You're goddamn right
I'm a sadist

1402
01:26:11,934 --> 01:26:14,169
and you're the perfect
willing victim.

1403
01:26:17,406 --> 01:26:20,543
Poor little housewife. You can't
take it straight, can you?

1404
01:26:20,576 --> 01:26:22,878
You want it all tied up
with hearts and flowers

1405
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:24,347
and lyrics by Hammerstein.

1406
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:26,282
I warned you. I called you.
Didn't I?

1407
01:26:26,315 --> 01:26:28,360
Now, you listen to me. There
have always been other broads

1408
01:26:28,384 --> 01:26:31,320
and there always will be.
Broads and broads and broads.

1409
01:26:31,354 --> 01:26:34,290
What the hell has that got
to do with you, Mrs. America?

1410
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:36,492
You're sick.

1411
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,295
Sick.

1412
01:26:41,397 --> 01:26:44,900
You have to put on
this big, virile act...

1413
01:26:46,369 --> 01:26:49,472
- because you're really a fag.
- Now, you listen girl.

1414
01:26:49,505 --> 01:26:51,674
You take these clothes
and you get dressed.

1415
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:54,243
And you get the hell out
of my house in one minute flat

1416
01:26:54,277 --> 01:26:56,379
or you are gonna be
a basket case.

1417
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:18,534
What's the matter?

1418
01:27:19,935 --> 01:27:21,337
Why are you up?

1419
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:27,310
I'm having
some hot milk and honey.

1420
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:30,613
My mother used to give it to me
when I was a kid...

1421
01:27:31,714 --> 01:27:33,516
when bad dreams woke me up.

1422
01:27:34,483 --> 01:27:35,718
Your mother?

1423
01:27:36,852 --> 01:27:38,354
Bad dreams?

1424
01:27:47,363 --> 01:27:49,332
Why can't you sleep, Jonathan?

1425
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:53,969
I was wondering. What ever
happened to my red suspenders?

1426
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:55,070
What red suspenders?

1427
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:57,340
I was wearing them
the night we met.

1428
01:27:57,373 --> 01:27:59,342
What ever happened to them?

1429
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:02,345
Oh, you must have thrown
them away a long time ago.

1430
01:28:03,479 --> 01:28:06,449
It was so hot at the democratic
club and I took off my jacket

1431
01:28:06,482 --> 01:28:10,386
and you dug my red suspenders.
Remember, Tine?

1432
01:28:12,087 --> 01:28:15,023
That speech you gave
was so good.

1433
01:28:15,057 --> 01:28:16,692
Yeah. Was it?

1434
01:28:18,427 --> 01:28:19,728
You were witty...

1435
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:22,365
and charming...

1436
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,602
and very sexy.

1437
01:28:28,504 --> 01:28:30,072
My new frontier type speech.

1438
01:28:30,939 --> 01:28:34,643
Oh, God, how I wanted to go
into politics in those days.

1439
01:28:35,077 --> 01:28:36,545
You remember
how fired up we were

1440
01:28:36,579 --> 01:28:38,581
about what was happening
in Washington?

1441
01:28:40,115 --> 01:28:42,351
We were so young and hopeful.

1442
01:28:44,487 --> 01:28:45,521
Sounds corny...

1443
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:51,427
but we were idealistic.
Weren't we, Tine?

1444
01:28:56,965 --> 01:28:58,367
And then...

1445
01:29:00,102 --> 01:29:01,804
suddenly it was all over.

1446
01:29:03,906 --> 01:29:05,474
Just gone.

1447
01:29:09,445 --> 01:29:12,515
I used to wake up three o'clock
in the morning, crying.

1448
01:29:14,049 --> 01:29:15,751
Because it wasn't there anymore.

1449
01:29:18,521 --> 01:29:20,489
It's three o'clock
in the morning now.

1450
01:29:27,463 --> 01:29:29,364
What's wrong, Jonathan?

1451
01:29:31,133 --> 01:29:33,536
Just about everything
you can think of is wrong.

1452
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:37,806
Tell me.

1453
01:29:40,443 --> 01:29:41,744
Do you really wanna know?

1454
01:29:46,649 --> 01:29:49,752
The... the vineyard in France
is a total loss.

1455
01:29:49,785 --> 01:29:51,487
No hope of salvaging a penny.

1456
01:29:52,488 --> 01:29:54,423
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1457
01:29:54,457 --> 01:29:58,561
Some, some, some kind of
plant disease. Root rot, uh...

1458
01:29:58,594 --> 01:30:00,529
Every vine is full of it.

1459
01:30:01,597 --> 01:30:04,567
- Did you invest a lot in it?
- A lot.

1460
01:30:05,668 --> 01:30:06,869
How much?

1461
01:30:08,637 --> 01:30:09,805
We're cleaned out.

1462
01:30:10,473 --> 01:30:13,742
I even sold our stock
and I'm in debt.

1463
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:16,745
[sighs] Well...

1464
01:30:20,549 --> 01:30:21,817
you'll just have to...

1465
01:30:23,519 --> 01:30:26,555
cut down
and live a lot differently.

1466
01:30:29,024 --> 01:30:32,761
After all, you... you still have
a good income from the firm.

1467
01:30:38,567 --> 01:30:39,735
Um...

1468
01:30:41,136 --> 01:30:44,172
that's another thing. I...

1469
01:30:45,841 --> 01:30:47,543
I'm in trouble at the office.

1470
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:49,044
It seems Hodison has been

1471
01:30:49,077 --> 01:30:51,847
extremely displeased
with me recently and...

1472
01:30:52,548 --> 01:30:55,651
today I tried for a motion
in a suit and lost.

1473
01:30:55,684 --> 01:30:58,253
He called me down
like a bloody office boy.

1474
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:00,589
He said... he said I may...

1475
01:31:01,524 --> 01:31:04,593
I'd be looking for a new job
if I didn't get with it.

1476
01:31:08,564 --> 01:31:09,765
What else, Jonathan?

1477
01:31:14,269 --> 01:31:17,706
Um... I've been having
an affair.

1478
01:31:25,748 --> 01:31:26,748
Yes.

1479
01:31:29,585 --> 01:31:31,754
Yes. Did Margo call you?
She threatened to.

1480
01:31:31,787 --> 01:31:33,388
I'll kill her if she did.

1481
01:31:37,259 --> 01:31:40,195
I knew it all along,
without really knowing.

1482
01:31:41,296 --> 01:31:44,032
I'm not cut out
for all that jazz.

1483
01:31:44,066 --> 01:31:46,602
All the lies.
All the arrangements.

1484
01:31:46,635 --> 01:31:47,770
And the guilt.

1485
01:31:48,971 --> 01:31:50,739
And... [chuckles]

1486
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:52,740
Oh...

1487
01:31:53,408 --> 01:31:56,211
Oh, I know
I've neglected you in...

1488
01:31:56,912 --> 01:31:58,547
in the hay.

1489
01:31:59,715 --> 01:32:01,584
I hate myself for it.

1490
01:32:03,085 --> 01:32:04,687
Tine...

1491
01:32:06,689 --> 01:32:08,891
I expected
a big scene over this.

1492
01:32:09,925 --> 01:32:12,527
Tears.
Recriminations.

1493
01:32:14,763 --> 01:32:18,233
Oh, Tina,
you're being wonderful.

1494
01:32:18,734 --> 01:32:19,868
Oh...

1495
01:32:20,669 --> 01:32:23,238
so patient and understanding.

1496
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:25,774
Please don't.

1497
01:32:27,843 --> 01:32:29,578
Don't make me out to be...

1498
01:32:30,679 --> 01:32:31,680
so...

1499
01:32:34,917 --> 01:32:36,251
well, so noble.

1500
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:40,589
You're a fine human being, Tina.

1501
01:32:41,757 --> 01:32:42,958
No, I'm not.

1502
01:32:44,727 --> 01:32:45,794
I...

1503
01:32:53,836 --> 01:32:55,638
I'm just a human being.

1504
01:32:57,372 --> 01:32:59,274
Do you want a divorce, Tine?

1505
01:33:01,710 --> 01:33:02,710
Or...

1506
01:33:03,378 --> 01:33:06,314
do you think we could pick up
the pieces and...

1507
01:33:06,849 --> 01:33:09,952
maybe work out a better
marriage than we ever had?

1508
01:33:16,291 --> 01:33:18,661
So, that's it.
That's where it's at.

1509
01:33:18,694 --> 01:33:21,730
Well, that's pretty dirty pool.
Your old man levels with you

1510
01:33:21,764 --> 01:33:23,866
and you don't open your mouth
about your boyfriend.

1511
01:33:23,899 --> 01:33:26,802
You leave the poor slob dragging
his guilt tail and you're just

1512
01:33:26,835 --> 01:33:28,713
- as guilty as he is.
- What obligation did she have,

1513
01:33:28,737 --> 01:33:30,839
to make that silly bastard
feel better?

1514
01:33:30,873 --> 01:33:34,710
I joined group with the
understanding I would get help

1515
01:33:34,743 --> 01:33:37,880
with my very real
and terrible life problems.

1516
01:33:37,913 --> 01:33:39,748
She has a husband, a lover,

1517
01:33:39,782 --> 01:33:42,050
and an eight-room apartment
on the park.

1518
01:33:42,084 --> 01:33:43,418
Why does she need help?

1519
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:45,320
Man: I don't understand
her problem.

1520
01:33:45,854 --> 01:33:47,923
Your husband works hard
to support you.

1521
01:33:47,956 --> 01:33:50,759
In return for which he wants
the house clean,

1522
01:33:50,793 --> 01:33:51,727
the buttons sewn on,

1523
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:55,097
and a modest amount
of sexual intercourse.

1524
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:56,540
I mean, what's your problem?

1525
01:33:56,564 --> 01:33:59,367
Man: You are nothing but
a spoilt middle class bitch.

1526
01:33:59,401 --> 01:34:01,937
Exactly like my ex-wife,
so I know where of I speak.

1527
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:04,006
Woman: wait till you hear
about some of the freaks.

[clamoring]

1529
01:34:05,808 --> 01:34:07,710
Woman:
She's doing it in group.

1530
01:34:07,743 --> 01:34:09,778
Man: What about those two
sweet little girls?

1531
01:34:09,812 --> 01:34:11,847
Woman: Be sure
your lawyer gets the dog.

1532
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:14,783
If your old man gets it,
he will leave it alone all day

1533
01:34:14,817 --> 01:34:16,819
and that is not good
for poodles.

1534
01:34:16,852 --> 01:34:18,362
- When a...
- Woman: Poodles are irrelevant.

1535
01:34:18,386 --> 01:34:20,823
Man: [screams] Who the hell
cares about poodles?

1536
01:34:20,856 --> 01:34:23,325
All we got here
is a rotten state of affairs.

1537
01:34:23,358 --> 01:34:25,293
[clamoring]

1538
01:34:26,094 --> 01:34:29,131
Woman: I want to build
a kiln in our garage.

1539
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:32,701
I want to have clay out there
and a potter's wheel out there

1540
01:34:32,735 --> 01:34:35,237
and make pots.
"Oh, no." my husband says,

1541
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:38,907
"No wife of the Chairman of the
Board of Strasberg and Stern

1542
01:34:38,941 --> 01:34:40,308
is going to make pots."

1543
01:34:40,342 --> 01:34:41,953
"Well, what's wrong
with pots?" I ask him.

1544
01:34:41,977 --> 01:34:44,446
"If you want pots, go out
and buy pots." he tells me.

1545
01:34:44,479 --> 01:34:47,783
Well, I don't want to buy pots.
I want to make pots.

1546
01:34:47,816 --> 01:34:51,720
Oh, my husband is a cannibal
who is devouring my life juices

1547
01:34:51,754 --> 01:34:53,832
just like your husband
is devouring your life juices.

1548
01:34:53,856 --> 01:34:55,758
Will you leave him?
Leave him.

1549
01:34:55,791 --> 01:34:58,026
Woman: Stay with him
and count your blessings.

1550

- Man 2: Ah, shit. Split!

- Man: Out!
