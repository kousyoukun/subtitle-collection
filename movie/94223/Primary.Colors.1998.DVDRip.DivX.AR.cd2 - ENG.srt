1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,385
So Tuesday, when you go to cast
your vote, think about that.

2
00:00:01,455 --> 00:00:04,390
Think about what you`re reaIIy
interested in.

3
00:00:04,458 --> 00:00:06,392
Then pick your candidate.

4
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:27,413
I don`t think I`II be abIe to
take it if he Ioses.

5
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:33,408
If he does Iose, maybe we
couId go away for a whiIe.

6
00:00:34,454 --> 00:00:36,422
Try some non-campaign sex.
See if it hoIds up.

7
00:00:43,463 --> 00:00:45,431
Goddamn it, Richard, why are
you aIways in my room?

8
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:47,433
Because it`s neater.

9
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,437
Henry, when this is over, we
shouId work together.

10
00:00:51,505 --> 00:00:53,439
Set up a consuIting firm.

11
00:00:53,507 --> 00:00:57,443
Both of you, enough ``when this
is over, we are pros`` crap.

12
00:00:57,511 --> 00:01:00,378
You may be pros, but I`m
emotionaIIy invoIved.

13
00:01:01,415 --> 00:01:03,383
-Can I sIeep here?
-No!

14
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,382
Okay, shit.

15
00:01:09,423 --> 00:01:11,391
See, a pro knows how to
say good-bye..

16
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:19,399
Polls are still open in
New Hampshire.

17
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:22,401
Harris is a serious man and
has serious things to say.

18
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:25,404
The people recognize that.

19
00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:30,409
ls we`ll see some upsets today, but
the biggest will be for Jack Stanton.

20
00:01:30,477 --> 00:01:34,413
Stanton, like Romney, Muskie and
Hart before him, flamed...

21
00:01:34,481 --> 00:01:37,416
then burned out. He`s just stirring
the ashes now.

22
00:01:38,452 --> 00:01:40,420
They can`t understand why
we don`t quit.

23
00:01:42,456 --> 00:01:44,424
I mean, don`t we know
we`re over?

24
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,429
An entire industry of poIiticaI
experts has espIained...

25
00:01:49,496 --> 00:01:50,428
why we`re dead.

26
00:01:50,497 --> 00:01:52,431
Why are stiII waIking around?

27
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:56,436
Across the upper Midwest.

28
00:01:57,471 --> 00:02:04,377
We predict Lawrence Harris to
win in New Hampshire.

29
00:02:05,412 --> 00:02:08,381
WeII, so what? It`s his state.
He has to win here.

30
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:13,375
Governor Jack Stanton, who is still
campaigning, has decided to...

31
00:02:13,453 --> 00:02:18,390
fight right down to the wire and is
out on this cold and rainy night...

32
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:23,395
working to get last minute votes.
This has been his technique and...

33
00:02:23,463 --> 00:02:25,397
many are surprised at how
effective it`s been.

34
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:28,401
According to exit polls, an
overwhelming number...

35
00:02:28,468 --> 00:02:30,402
of Stanton voters say that what
decided them was actually...

36
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,404
meeting the governor.

37
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,409
So, we predict Governor
Jack Stanton...

38
00:02:36,476 --> 00:02:39,411
a close second to
Lawrence Harris.

39
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,411
I`II be a son of a bitch!

40
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,415
Don`t be discouraged. We
can stiII win!

41
00:02:43,483 --> 00:02:47,419
Are you crazy? Didn`t you hear?
We`re second. We`re aIive.

42
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:49,421
We`re a finking miracIe.

43
00:03:02,402 --> 00:03:04,370
We have a chance now,
a real chance.

44
00:03:04,438 --> 00:03:06,372
If we couId just eIiminate Harris.

45
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,377
-Harris wiII take CoIorado.
-And FIorida, unIess you hit him.

46
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:13,379
I`II get FIorida.
It`s the South.

47
00:03:13,447 --> 00:03:17,383
But it`s Jewish. You must fire a
siIver buIIet in FIorida.

48
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:19,385
Without Harris, we can win.

49
00:03:19,453 --> 00:03:23,389
No. Negative wiII boomerang. I
know it. I`m not going negative.

50
00:03:24,424 --> 00:03:27,393
For President, Jack Stanton or
Lawrence Harris?

51
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:32,387
l served my country in Korea and my
boy Jeff fought in the Gulf War.

52
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:35,401
Jack Stanton dodged the
Vietnam draft...

53
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:39,405
And covered up his anti-war
arrest record.

54
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,408
l believe in real solutions and
telling the truth.

55
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:45,411
Jack Stanton believes in glib
answers to tough question...

56
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,413
about his country and himself.

57
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:51,417
l`m Lawrence Harris. l`ll fight the
tough fights.

58
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:55,421
l won`t run away. lt`s a question
of character.

59
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:58,424
Paid for by the Harris for
President Committee.

60
00:04:11,404 --> 00:04:12,371
Okay. I`m going to kiII
the bastard.

61
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:17,376
AIthough I think he`s a
fine man...

62
00:04:17,444 --> 00:04:20,379
and agree we need to Iower the
deficit, I don`t agree...

63
00:04:20,447 --> 00:04:22,381
with Senator Harris`s...

64
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:26,385
proposaI to reduce or even
freeze cost of Iiving...

65
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:28,387
adjustments for SociaI Security.

66
00:04:29,422 --> 00:04:32,391
I aIso disagree with Senator
Harris about Medicare.

67
00:04:35,428 --> 00:04:38,397
Senator Harris and I aIso disagree
about the MiddIe East.

68
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:44,392
WhiIe in the Senate my opponent
cast many votes regarding the...

69
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:47,406
security of the state of IsraeI.

70
00:04:50,443 --> 00:04:52,411
I agree with many of his votes,
but some it`s important...

71
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,413
to stand with our friends.

72
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:58,417
And America has no better friend
than the state of IsraeI.

73
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:09,362
We`re up three points
and cIimbing...

74
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:12,364
so a meeting with the Rainbow
CoaIition might...

75
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:15,368
Who is it?

76
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:17,369
WiIIiam McCoIIister.

77
00:05:17,437 --> 00:05:20,372
Can I caII you back? I`II just
be five minutes.

78
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:27,380
You don`t remember me,
Mr Burton?

79
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:30,383
WiIIie, the barbecue pIace.
Come on in.

80
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,388
What are you doing here?

81
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:39,391
I figured it wouId be easier to taIk
face-to-face with a brother...

82
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:43,395
than to the Gov, even though
he`s Iike a brother.

83
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:49,391
I, um...I fIew here because my
daughter Loretta`s with chiId...

84
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:53,405
and she says Jack Stanton`s
the daddy.

85
00:05:57,444 --> 00:05:58,411
Right.

86
00:06:02,382 --> 00:06:03,349
Has he Ianded yet?

87
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:06,352
He`s in the men`s room.

88
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:09,355
-Is he aIone?
-What do you mean?

89
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,357
Doesn`t matter.

90
00:06:16,396 --> 00:06:20,355
-We`re in the Iead.
-Good, good.

91
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:23,368
Harris is second. ActuaIIy,
undecided`s kiIIing everyone.

92
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:26,371
WiIIie McCoIIister came to
see me Iast night.

93
00:06:27,407 --> 00:06:29,375
His daughter`s pregnant and
says you`re the father.

94
00:06:38,418 --> 00:06:40,386
-Who eIse knows?
-He says no one.

95
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:43,388
-What does he want?
-I don`t know.

96
00:06:46,426 --> 00:06:48,394
I just can`t catch
a break, can I?

97
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:51,397
AII right, aII right.

98
00:06:52,432 --> 00:06:55,401
-Is WiIIie stiII here?
-No, he went back this morning.

99
00:06:56,436 --> 00:07:00,395
I can`t Ieave before the primary. If
this gets out, it`II kiII us. You...

100
00:07:00,473 --> 00:07:05,410
and Howard have to fIy back to
Mammoth FaIIs. TaIk to him.

101
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:08,413
We have to make sure he knows
this is a mistake.

102
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:12,418
They`re good peopIe, but not
sophisticated. I want them to know.

103
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:16,422
Why pick me? Because
I`m bIack?

104
00:07:17,457 --> 00:07:19,425
No. Because WiIIie
picked you.

105
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:24,430
You don`t have to taIk. Howard
knows to say.

106
00:07:24,497 --> 00:07:27,432
But you shouId be here, because
he came to you.

107
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:32,427
Governor, if I`m doing this, then
there`s something I need to know.

108
00:07:32,505 --> 00:07:34,439
I am not the father of that chiId.

109
00:07:36,476 --> 00:07:38,444
Henry, you wiII never have to be
ashamed to be part...

110
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:40,445
of this campaign. Understand.

111
00:07:40,513 --> 00:07:44,449
You`II never have to swaIIow it,
duck it or apoIogize for it.

112
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:46,451
I`II make sure that
doesn`t happen.

113
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:48,454
Guys?

114
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,406
Hey, Mr. Burton.

115
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:10,409
Hey, Gov.

116
00:08:14,447 --> 00:08:17,416
You remember Howard Ferguson. He
works with the Governor, too.

117
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:27,426
What can I do for you?

118
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:34,422
The Governor is very concerned about
this situation with your daughter.

119
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:40,428
He`d Iike to see it resoIved as
I`m sure you wouId.

120
00:08:42,475 --> 00:08:44,443
He wants her to have an
amniocentesis performed...

121
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:48,447
so paternity can be estabIished.

122
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:49,447
A what?

123
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:52,451
It`s a medicaI procedure
performed in a hospitaI.

124
00:08:54,487 --> 00:08:56,455
A needIe is inserted into
the abdomen.

125
00:08:56,523 --> 00:08:59,492
Amniotic fIuid is draw from
your daughter`s womb.

126
00:08:59,492 --> 00:09:03,394
Genetic materiaI is compared
with the Governor`s to...

127
00:09:03,463 --> 00:09:05,397
to determine if he is the father.

128
00:09:05,465 --> 00:09:06,397
I don`t understand.

129
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:08,400
NormaIIy it`s used to determine
fetaI heaIth.

130
00:09:08,468 --> 00:09:11,403
That`s what you`II teII
the hospitaI.

131
00:09:11,471 --> 00:09:14,406
You want to make sure the
baby`s heaIthy.

132
00:09:14,474 --> 00:09:16,408
-A needIe?
-It`s a common procedure.

133
00:09:16,476 --> 00:09:20,412
-They`d put a needIe her in beIIy?
-Look, Mr. McCoIIister...

134
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,415
some peopIe want to destroy
Governor Stanton.

135
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,419
He doesn`t think you do. But he
can`t aIIow this. You can`t.

136
00:09:29,455 --> 00:09:31,423
I`m sure Loretta`s a fine person,
but she`s a chiId.

137
00:09:31,491 --> 00:09:34,426
And chiIdren are
impressionabIe.

138
00:09:34,494 --> 00:09:38,430
She ain`t said a word to anybody.
She`s a good girI.

139
00:09:40,466 --> 00:09:43,435
I`m sure she is. And the Governor
wants to heIp her...

140
00:09:43,503 --> 00:09:48,440
and you, through this. He is
prepared to be very generous.

141
00:09:49,475 --> 00:09:52,444
He wiII heIp provide
for the baby.

142
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:57,438
He wiII do this because he
beIieves you are his friend.

143
00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:03,389
But we must resoIve this.

144
00:10:04,424 --> 00:10:07,393
We must determine that he is
not father of that chiId.

145
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,397
I`m sure that you...

146
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:15,401
you know, you understand...

147
00:10:17,437 --> 00:10:19,405
our position.

148
00:10:26,446 --> 00:10:27,413
PuII over.

149
00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:30,416
PuII over.

150
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,429
I`m Izzi RosenbIat, with
``Schmooze for Jews.``

151
00:10:54,507 --> 00:10:57,442
My guest today is presidentiaI
nominne...

152
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,377
and JFK IookaIike, Governor
Jack Stanton.

153
00:11:01,414 --> 00:11:03,382
Jack, when we were
taIking before...

154
00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:06,384
you said your mama
Iiked Vegas.

155
00:11:06,452 --> 00:11:10,388
As a tip to our Iisteners, where
does she stay?

156
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:12,390
She`s IoyaI to the
MGM Grand.

157
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,393
MGM Grand. Listen up,
you Vegas fans.

158
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:18,396
And who is her favorite act?
Is it Wayne Newton?

159
00:11:18,464 --> 00:11:19,396
AbsoIuteIy.

160
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:21,399
Everyone Ioves
Wayne Newton.

161
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:25,403
He came on this show. Of course,
that was many years ago.

162
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:29,407
Now, to satisfy the curiosity
of our Vegas fans...

163
00:11:29,475 --> 00:11:34,412
when your mother pIays bIackjack,
where does she stand pat? Sixteen?

164
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,416
She`s a bit of a gambIer. Sometimes
she goes up to 17.

165
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:41,420
Oh, my. Excuse me,
Governor.

166
00:11:41,487 --> 00:11:44,422
I`m toId we have Senator
Harris on the phone.

167
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,427
HeIIo. This is indeed
an honor.

168
00:11:49,462 --> 00:11:52,431
Governor Stanton was teIIing us
his mother Ioves Las Vegas.

169
00:11:52,498 --> 00:11:57,435
Does your mother have a favorite
vacation spot?

170
00:11:57,503 --> 00:11:58,435
My mother`s dead.

171
00:12:00,406 --> 00:12:01,373
Oh. I`m sorry.

172
00:12:02,408 --> 00:12:04,376
And Jack Stanton should be
ashamed of his scaring...

173
00:12:04,444 --> 00:12:06,378
elderly people down here.

174
00:12:06,446 --> 00:12:08,380
You mean about going
up to seventeen?

175
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:10,382
I don`t foIIow you.

176
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:14,386
He`s telling people l want to
cut their Social Security.

177
00:12:14,454 --> 00:12:16,388
Larry, it`s in your book.

178
00:12:16,456 --> 00:12:19,391
You`re playing sleazy
politics!

179
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:21,393
Izzi, can I speak?

180
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:25,397
Be my guest, governor. What am
I saying? You`re are my guest!

181
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:30,391
Larry, I`m Iooking at your campaign,
page 18, paragraph 3.

182
00:12:31,437 --> 00:12:35,396
It says you want to ``study`` a freeze
of cost of Iiving adjustments.

183
00:12:36,442 --> 00:12:40,401
That`s one possibility. We might want
to rework how they`re calculated.

184
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,417
Cost of Iiving adjustments are
caIcuIated to keep up with infIation.

185
00:12:45,485 --> 00:12:47,419
I guess you don`t Iike that.

186
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,422
-Wait! l don`t say that!
-lt`s in your book.

187
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,425
l said it has to be studied.
Who knows?

188
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:57,429
We might want to spend more on
cost of living adjustments.

189
00:12:57,497 --> 00:13:01,365
Senator Harris, Who is your
favorite comedian?

190
00:13:01,434 --> 00:13:04,369
I`m just teIIing foIks what
my positions are.

191
00:13:04,437 --> 00:13:08,373
No, you`re distorting my positions.
That`s why no trusts politicians.

192
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:11,376
-You can`t defend your positions.
-You`re playing games.

193
00:13:11,444 --> 00:13:14,379
Folks, we can`t keep spending
money this way.

194
00:13:14,447 --> 00:13:19,384
But you just said you might to spend
more on cost of Iiving adjustments.

195
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:20,384
No, l, uh...

196
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:23,389
Excuse me. Now listen...

197
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:27,393
Excuse me.

198
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,398
What happened? Did he hang up?

199
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:37,392
Yes, yes. WeII, so teII me,
Governor...

200
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,402
who`s your favorite comedian?

201
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:42,408
-The phones haven`t stopped ringing!
-It was fantastic.

202
00:13:43,443 --> 00:13:46,412
We couIdn`t beIieve it when
Harris caIIed. CouId we?

203
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:49,414
He`s fucked. We`II waIk
away with FIorida.

204
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,418
Wait! Turn on CNN.

205
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:56,422
Senator Harris suffered
two heart attacks...

206
00:13:56,489 --> 00:14:00,357
the first after a phone call with
Governor Jack Stanton...

207
00:14:00,426 --> 00:14:03,361
during a Florida radio show.

208
00:14:04,397 --> 00:14:05,364
Jesus.

209
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,368
-Oh, shit. We heard him having it.
-He remains in a coma.

210
00:14:09,435 --> 00:14:12,370
His condition is critical. But hospital
sources will not comment...

211
00:14:12,438 --> 00:14:15,373
on the Senator`s condition
at this point.

212
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:19,378
lt`s difficult to say what affect this
will have on the campaign.

213
00:14:31,424 --> 00:14:33,392
The vote`s in 2 days.
What do we do?

214
00:14:35,428 --> 00:14:38,397
Go back to Mammoth FaIIs. Daisy
puIIs the negative ads.

215
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:40,398
I understand how
you feeI, but...

216
00:14:41,434 --> 00:14:43,402
We go back to Mammoth FaIIs.

217
00:14:53,446 --> 00:14:56,415
I was so pridefuI, so
fucking smug.

218
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:58,416
You couIdn`t have known.

219
00:14:59,452 --> 00:15:02,353
We were going to win. I couId
have been gracious.

220
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,358
I`m sorry. The man cuts a
vicious negative ad...

221
00:15:06,425 --> 00:15:08,359
ambushes you on a taIk show
and caIIs you sIeazy...

222
00:15:08,427 --> 00:15:12,363
and you`re supposed
to be gracious?

223
00:15:12,431 --> 00:15:13,363
Is Jackie okay?

224
00:15:13,432 --> 00:15:15,366
He`s fine. Go on. Don`t
stop the meeting.

225
00:15:17,403 --> 00:15:20,372
Harris is a smart man and he`s
right about the damn issue.

226
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:22,373
The bastard rubbed your
nose in it.

227
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:26,377
And I rubbed his nose back. But
that`s not how you win the big ones.

228
00:15:28,414 --> 00:15:30,382
I don`t know what to do now.

229
00:15:32,418 --> 00:15:35,387
I guess I`II back tonight, address
the victory party.

230
00:15:36,422 --> 00:15:39,391
Try to get Mrs. Harris on
the phone again.

231
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:43,394
She hasn`t returned my phone
caIIs, but you can`t bIame her.

232
00:15:43,462 --> 00:15:45,396
What do you think?

233
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:56,408
What the fuck were you
and Howard staring at?

234
00:15:56,475 --> 00:15:57,407
Nothing. No one.

235
00:15:57,476 --> 00:16:00,343
BuIIshit. Who was that
woman with Susan?

236
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:03,348
It Iooked Iike Fat
WiIIie`s wife.

237
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,350
Why is she worth staring at?

238
00:16:08,387 --> 00:16:10,355
Henry, what the fuck is
going on here?

239
00:16:10,423 --> 00:16:11,355
Nothing!

240
00:16:26,405 --> 00:16:27,372
AII right. AII right.

241
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:36,370
Son of a bitch! Amniocentesis,
you motherfucker!

242
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:42,376
-Susan, I`m sorry.
-When were you going to teII me?!

243
00:17:07,446 --> 00:17:08,413
I`m sorry. I`m sorry.

244
00:17:13,452 --> 00:17:16,421
l know we wish Senator Harris
a full and speedy recovery.

245
00:17:16,489 --> 00:17:20,425
l think the people of Florida will
understand if l forego...

246
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:26,432
any talk of victory or defeat... and
ask them to join me in prayer.

247
00:17:26,465 --> 00:17:29,434
I know New York. Everything is
driven by the tabIoids.

248
00:17:29,502 --> 00:17:32,437
-Where`s Henry? Daisy?
-I don`t know. I fIew in with you.

249
00:17:32,505 --> 00:17:34,439
Brad, the New York numbers.

250
00:17:34,507 --> 00:17:39,444
You`re at 22% and Harris is
running at 18%, comatose.

251
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,448
-Shit, Henry.
-Sorry.

252
00:17:43,516 --> 00:17:47,452
How do you think New York wiII
take the thing with Harris?

253
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,457
WeII, Susan, I think first we have
to see if Harris is stiII in.

254
00:17:52,525 --> 00:17:54,459
That`s not very heIpfuI. LuciIIe?

255
00:17:55,494 --> 00:17:57,462
WeII, if Harris is out and Ozio
doesn`t jump in...

256
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,397
I say we win by defauIt.

257
00:18:00,466 --> 00:18:02,400
My God, this poor woman.

258
00:18:03,436 --> 00:18:05,404
l want to thank all of you...

259
00:18:05,471 --> 00:18:08,406
for your remarkable outpouring
of affection.

260
00:18:09,442 --> 00:18:14,402
lt`s obvious my husband will not
be able to continue his campaign.

261
00:18:15,448 --> 00:18:18,417
Fantastic! I mean, weII...
you know what I mean.

262
00:18:18,484 --> 00:18:19,416
We have asked our good friend
former Governor...

263
00:18:19,485 --> 00:18:20,417
Fred Picker of Florida.

264
00:18:20,486 --> 00:18:23,421
to carry on.

265
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:31,419
To continue to raise questions in
a meaningful, honorable way.

266
00:18:31,497 --> 00:18:34,432
She`s not too upset to
give us a poke.

267
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:38,437
Come on. Her husband may be
dying and she thinks Jack did it.

268
00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:41,439
l turn the campaign over
to Governor Picker.

269
00:18:45,478 --> 00:18:48,447
Excuse me. This is a rather
emotional time.

270
00:18:49,482 --> 00:18:51,450
Governor, do you think you can
win the nomination?

271
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:57,445
Well, l`m not out to,
win the nomination.

272
00:18:57,523 --> 00:19:01,391
l`m out to continue what
Senator Harris began...

273
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,396
to give Americans an honest
choice on the issues.

274
00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:06,396
But if you won the nomination?

275
00:19:06,465 --> 00:19:09,400
lt`s really premature to talk
about that now.

276
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:12,403
l haven`t had time to
think about it.

277
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,399
What l have thought about is the
best way l can help Senator Harris.

278
00:19:19,478 --> 00:19:24,415
As l know him as a man of
action rather than words...

279
00:19:24,483 --> 00:19:29,420
the best action is for me to go down
and donate a pint of blood,...

280
00:19:29,488 --> 00:19:33,424
because that`s he needs now.

281
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:37,429
lf you want to come with ma
and donate a pint,...

282
00:19:37,496 --> 00:19:39,430
Mrs. Harris would appreciate it.

283
00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:43,435
Jesus Christ, we shouId have
thought of that.

284
00:19:45,471 --> 00:19:46,438
Great goddamn move.

285
00:19:47,473 --> 00:19:51,432
How do we run against this guy
if he not going to run?

286
00:19:52,478 --> 00:19:55,447
Shit, he`II run. But tiII he announces
it he`s the fIavor of the week...

287
00:19:55,514 --> 00:19:58,449
and goIden. We just wait
untiI he comes out.

288
00:20:04,423 --> 00:20:07,392
Lawrence Harris made several
negative spots.

289
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,397
His pollsters have advised more.
Will you go in that direction?

290
00:20:12,465 --> 00:20:16,401
No. l won`t be doing any spots
or having any polls,...

291
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:18,403
because l`m not paying
any pollsters.

292
00:20:18,471 --> 00:20:21,406
l`m not hiring folks to tell me
what you`re thinking...

293
00:20:21,474 --> 00:20:23,408
or how to get at you.

294
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:25,410
Then what are you
going to do?

295
00:20:25,478 --> 00:20:27,412
Just talk straight.

296
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,415
Jesus Christ. Who is this guy?

297
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:33,418
don`t panic. He`s as much as
admitted he`s running.

298
00:20:33,486 --> 00:20:36,421
So now we`II see some tamish
on the goIden image.

299
00:20:37,456 --> 00:20:40,425
The media giveth and...
go fuck yourseIf.

300
00:20:42,461 --> 00:20:45,430
Governor, why did you quit
politics in 1978?

301
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:49,434
There were a lot of reasons. l
had personal problems.

302
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,439
This can`t be easy to talk about.

303
00:20:54,507 --> 00:20:55,439
No, it`s not.

304
00:20:55,508 --> 00:20:58,443
But l guess it`s part of the game
now, so l`ll be candid.

305
00:20:59,478 --> 00:21:00,376
l got too wrapped up in...

306
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:06,385
being governor, and l began to
neglect my family.

307
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:09,387
My wife fell in love with
another man.

308
00:21:10,422 --> 00:21:14,381
l quit, in part to see if l could
salvage my marriage...

309
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,395
but l couldn`t. So then l just
wanted to make sure...

310
00:21:17,463 --> 00:21:20,398
my boys knew l loved them.

311
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:24,402
l think if you ask them, they`ll
say we made it through okay.

312
00:21:25,437 --> 00:21:28,406
They`re in college now and when Mrs.
Harris asked me to do this.....

313
00:21:28,474 --> 00:21:31,409
they were very enthusiastic.
l guess you could say...

314
00:21:31,477 --> 00:21:34,412
l`m doing this for them, too.

315
00:21:34,446 --> 00:21:36,414
Awesome. The best I`ve
ever seen.

316
00:21:36,482 --> 00:21:38,416
What do we do?

317
00:21:39,451 --> 00:21:41,419
WeII, now we panic.

318
00:21:49,461 --> 00:21:50,428
Hey, amnio man!

319
00:21:51,463 --> 00:21:53,431
God, how in the heII did
you find out?

320
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:55,433
Loretta taIked to a
schooImate.

321
00:21:55,501 --> 00:21:59,471
Ä Current Affair`` just offered the
McCoIIisters $250,000.

322
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:02,372
Fat WiIIie threw them
off the property.

323
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:05,376
I stashed them in another county.
I couId kiII Jack.

324
00:22:05,444 --> 00:22:07,378
He says he`s not the father.

325
00:22:07,446 --> 00:22:09,380
He`s probabIy not. It
doesn`t matter.

326
00:22:09,448 --> 00:22:12,383
Shit begets shit. Cashmere made
anything possibIe.

327
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:14,386
Didn`t she?

328
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:19,380
I`m a good consuItant and I know New
York, but I`m not a magician.

329
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,392
The rumor`s about you and
the bIack girI...

330
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,396
Say I gave bIood to disprove
the charge and...

331
00:22:25,464 --> 00:22:27,398
we`re waiting for the resuIts.

332
00:22:27,466 --> 00:22:28,398
Too defensive.

333
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:32,404
And Iook at the contrast between why
you gave bIood and why Picker did.

334
00:22:32,471 --> 00:22:34,405
I agree. But it might be good to
get on some TV shows...

335
00:22:34,473 --> 00:22:36,407
Iike ``Oprah`` and ``GeraIdo``.

336
00:22:36,475 --> 00:22:39,410
You mean strip away those Iast
annoying shreds of dignity...

337
00:22:39,478 --> 00:22:41,412
and waIIow in trash.

338
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,415
Why campaign in New
York at aII?

339
00:22:44,483 --> 00:22:47,418
You can`t skip New York.

340
00:22:47,486 --> 00:22:49,455
They`II kiII me.

341
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:51,423
No, it`II just feeI Iike
they have.

342
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,427
But you`II survive. We aII find
a way to survive.

343
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:04,369
That`s why I`m so happy to be New
York...to have the opportunity to...

344
00:23:05,404 --> 00:23:07,372
If you`d just give me
a chance.

345
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,379
Give me a chance to, to
answer your questions.

346
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:19,384
I Iove New York!

347
00:23:26,425 --> 00:23:28,393
Bugger, bugger, bugger!

348
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,394
You`re a phony! A pederast!

349
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:38,392
You`re a sick, hetero fuck!

350
00:23:57,456 --> 00:23:59,458
I can`t make much of this.

351
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,358
Tomorrow we start
Connecticut..

352
00:24:01,427 --> 00:24:04,362
Picker`s speaking at a raIIy
there. We hit it, too.

353
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:09,367
He don`t. He`s meeting with
the Lubavitcher Rebbe.

354
00:24:09,435 --> 00:24:11,369
What? Who the fuck
decided that?

355
00:24:11,437 --> 00:24:14,372
The Rebbe. You can`t win
New York without him.

356
00:24:15,407 --> 00:24:17,375
Norman knows New York.
It`s his caII.

357
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,379
Susan`s right. You go to the raIIy.
I`II keep the appointment.

358
00:25:06,391 --> 00:25:08,359
Thank you. WeII, this is kind
of overwheIming.

359
00:25:11,396 --> 00:25:13,364
He`s nervous now. He`s
the man now.

360
00:25:17,402 --> 00:25:19,370
I didn`t expect this.

361
00:25:22,407 --> 00:25:26,366
And aII the foIks giving bIood
in the back...

362
00:25:26,445 --> 00:25:29,380
I want to thank them.
I reaIIy do.

363
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:36,387
WouId aII of you do
me a favor?

364
00:25:36,455 --> 00:25:39,390
Don`t shout quite so Ioud.
Thanks.

365
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:49,389
I reaIIy mean it. I wish everyone
wouId just caIm down a IittIe.

366
00:25:50,435 --> 00:25:52,403
When I say ``everyone``, I mean
the press and the TV...

367
00:25:52,471 --> 00:25:54,405
crews and aII my coIIeagues...

368
00:25:54,473 --> 00:26:00,343
and aII the peopIe who
advise my coIIeagues.

369
00:26:00,412 --> 00:26:02,346
I think we need to caIm
down some.

370
00:26:04,383 --> 00:26:05,350
You know...

371
00:26:07,386 --> 00:26:09,354
this is a terrific country.

372
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:13,358
But sometimes we go a IittIe crazy.
Maybe that`s part of...

373
00:26:13,425 --> 00:26:17,361
our greatness, party
of our freedom.

374
00:26:18,397 --> 00:26:21,366
But if we don`t watch out
and caIm down,...

375
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:23,367
it aII may spin out of controI.

376
00:26:25,404 --> 00:26:28,373
You know, the worId is getting more
and more compIicated.

377
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,376
PoIiticians have to expIain
things to you...

378
00:26:32,444 --> 00:26:34,378
in simpIer terms...

379
00:26:34,446 --> 00:26:38,382
so that they can get their IittIe
oversimpIified expIanations...

380
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:42,386
on the evening news.

381
00:26:43,422 --> 00:26:46,391
And eventuaIIy, instead of
even trying to expIain...

382
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:49,393
they give up and start sIinging
mud at each other.

383
00:26:49,461 --> 00:26:52,396
And it`s aII to keep you excited,
keep you watching...

384
00:26:52,464 --> 00:26:56,400
Iike you watch a...a car
wreck or a...

385
00:26:56,468 --> 00:27:02,407
wrestIing match. That`s just what
it`s Iike professionaI wrestIing.

386
00:27:04,443 --> 00:27:07,412
It`s staged and it`s fake and it
doesn`t mean anything.

387
00:27:09,448 --> 00:27:13,407
That goes for the debates. We
don`t hate our opponents.

388
00:27:13,485 --> 00:27:15,419
HaIf the time we don`t
even know them.

389
00:27:16,455 --> 00:27:20,414
But it seems it`s the onIy way we
know how to keep you aII riIed up.

390
00:27:22,461 --> 00:27:24,429
So what I want to do is
quiet things down...

391
00:27:24,496 --> 00:27:29,433
and start having a
conversation...

392
00:27:29,501 --> 00:27:35,440
about what sort of country we want
this to be in the next century.

393
00:27:37,476 --> 00:27:39,444
And I want Governor Stanton
to know that I...

394
00:27:39,511 --> 00:27:41,445
weIcome him to this
conversation.

395
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:45,450
Okay. This show is yours. You
gentIemen know the ruIes.

396
00:27:45,517 --> 00:27:48,452
No eye-gouging, no
chair-tossing.

397
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,454
Three knockdowns,
I stop the bout.

398
00:27:50,522 --> 00:27:52,456
I hope he doesn`t Iose it.
GeraIdo wiII go after...

399
00:27:52,524 --> 00:27:54,458
him end Picker`s smooth.

400
00:27:54,526 --> 00:27:57,461
-He won`t Iose it.
-He doesn`t have anything to Iose.

401
00:28:02,434 --> 00:28:04,402
ls there any truth whatsoever...

402
00:28:04,469 --> 00:28:06,403
to the awful allegation that you
are the father of a...

403
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:08,405
child by a teenage girl?

404
00:28:08,473 --> 00:28:09,405
Oh, shit.

405
00:28:09,474 --> 00:28:14,411
No, it`s good it`s out there. Now, if
Jack just keeps the answer short...

406
00:28:14,446 --> 00:28:17,415
by the publicity over the phony
Cashmere McLeod tapes.

407
00:28:17,482 --> 00:28:20,417
Her family are good people.
They`re my friends.

408
00:28:20,485 --> 00:28:22,419
l just spoke with the father...

409
00:28:22,487 --> 00:28:26,423
and he apologized for causing
me so much trouble.

410
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:30,428
I think that`s aII we need to know,
Jack. Right, foIks?

411
00:28:31,463 --> 00:28:35,422
Jesus Christ. Picker actuaIIy saved
him. I`ve never seen that before.

412
00:28:36,468 --> 00:28:40,427
Maybe this is the first time. Maybe
Picker`s the reaI thing.

413
00:28:41,473 --> 00:28:45,432
You know what your probIem is,
Hotchkiss? You got gaIIoping TB.

414
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,444
You don`t mean tubercuIosis,
right?

415
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,448
No, I mean True BeIieverism. You
taIk and act Iike a pro...

416
00:28:50,515 --> 00:28:54,451
but inside you`re just Iike Libby,
who actuaIIy goes crazy...

417
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:58,455
when her candidate turns
out not to be a rock.

418
00:28:59,491 --> 00:29:01,391
In `78, she actuaIIy wore a
button that said...

419
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,395
``I`m Picker person`` and nose
dived when he quit the race.

420
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,399
-Didn`t even try to find out why...
-He toId us why.

421
00:29:10,435 --> 00:29:13,404
What? He wanted to stay
home with his kids?

422
00:29:13,472 --> 00:29:16,407
``I`d rather be dad than president``?
Give me a break.

423
00:29:17,609 --> 00:29:21,443
The race among Democratic
contenders is still a toss-up.

424
00:29:21,513 --> 00:29:23,447
Polls taken after both men
appeared on ``Geraldo``...

425
00:29:23,515 --> 00:29:25,484
indicate that governor Picker...

426
00:29:25,484 --> 00:29:28,453
has a substantial lead...

427
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,456
but there has been a remarkable 5%
increase for Governor Stanton.

428
00:29:33,492 --> 00:29:34,459
Fucking Norman Asher.

429
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,468
I`m taking a Ieave of absence.
I can`t stay and take...

430
00:29:43,535 --> 00:29:45,469
orders from Norman Asher.

431
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:47,471
We`re from different parts of the
jungIe. The thing`s...

432
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:49,473
about gone anyway.

433
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:51,475
I can`t beIieve this.

434
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:56,470
Why? Henry, I`ve been through
this shit a hundred times.

435
00:29:57,516 --> 00:30:00,485
These guys Iove you then they
stop Ioving you.

436
00:30:00,552 --> 00:30:02,486
Yeah, but Stanton`s different.

437
00:30:02,554 --> 00:30:03,486
Yeah, he`s different.

438
00:30:04,523 --> 00:30:06,491
He was worth it.

439
00:30:07,526 --> 00:30:09,494
You take care of your ass,
Hotchkiss.

440
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:15,500
I`II see you next time.

441
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:29,447
I`m sorry about Iosing
Daisy and Richard...

442
00:30:29,514 --> 00:30:31,448
but we`re pros and these
things happen.

443
00:30:32,484 --> 00:30:37,444
Now, I want to taIk about something
Richard said about Picker...

444
00:30:37,522 --> 00:30:39,456
that I want to find out.

445
00:30:40,492 --> 00:30:43,461
Why did Picker quit in `78?

446
00:30:49,367 --> 00:30:51,335
AII I heard about was a
condo deveIopment...

447
00:30:51,536 --> 00:30:53,470
named CIearwater Estates...

448
00:30:53,538 --> 00:30:57,474
where the state and county matched
funds to buiId a connecting road.

449
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,477
And?

450
00:31:00,512 --> 00:31:01,479
Nothing specific.

451
00:31:03,515 --> 00:31:05,483
The project deveIoper was a guy
named Edgardo Reyes.

452
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,485
Edgardo Reyes is the brother
of Antonia Reyes.

453
00:31:09,554 --> 00:31:14,491
Picker`s former wife. Did anyone
ever foIIow this up.

454
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,491
No.

455
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:19,429
WeII, Libby, Iet`s go.

456
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:23,434
What?

457
00:31:26,471 --> 00:31:27,438
What?

458
00:31:28,473 --> 00:31:30,441
-I`m trying to decide.
-Decide what?

459
00:31:31,476 --> 00:31:33,444
If I want to do this, you
stupid shit!

460
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:37,448
I protested you. I don`t do
in the opponent.

461
00:31:37,516 --> 00:31:39,450
What is the difference?

462
00:31:40,485 --> 00:31:43,454
AII the difference in the worId.
AII the moraI difference.

463
00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:47,458
I`m not too interested in tearing
Fred Picker down.

464
00:31:48,493 --> 00:31:51,462
-And if he`s bad?
-It`II out.

465
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:54,465
But when? Say he wins
the nomination...

466
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:58,469
and then it comes out. Now,
Iook at this.

467
00:32:00,505 --> 00:32:03,474
ResuIts of the bIood test
Dr. Beauregard gave me.

468
00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:07,512
CongratuIations. I`m sure
this wiII heIp.

469
00:32:07,512 --> 00:32:08,479
But it won`t.

470
00:32:09,514 --> 00:32:13,473
You know it. It won`t matter my bIood
doesn`t match Loretta`s baby`s.

471
00:32:13,552 --> 00:32:15,486
It won`t matter I can`t
be the father.

472
00:32:16,521 --> 00:32:18,421
It wouId onIy matter if I were
the father. Because...

473
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,424
guiIt is what`s interesting.

474
00:32:20,492 --> 00:32:23,427
Am I supposed to accept this and
Iet Picker sIide in...

475
00:32:23,495 --> 00:32:26,430
because you were a ``Picker Person``
in the 70s?

476
00:32:27,465 --> 00:32:30,434
You mean injustice for aII?
That`s a stupid argument!

477
00:32:30,502 --> 00:32:32,436
Okay, but this isn`t.

478
00:32:32,504 --> 00:32:35,439
Picker couId be guiIty of fraud.

479
00:32:35,507 --> 00:32:37,441
If he used infIuence to heIp
his brother in-Iaw,...

480
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:38,441
he can`t be president.

481
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,444
He couId be a reaI shit.

482
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,439
Forget who you thought he was. You
most find out who he reaIIy is.

483
00:32:55,493 --> 00:32:56,460
Get packed.

484
00:33:00,498 --> 00:33:02,466
We are in Iimbo now,
Henry.

485
00:33:04,502 --> 00:33:08,461
We are outside the
mainstream.

486
00:33:10,508 --> 00:33:11,475
We are in purgatory.

487
00:33:13,511 --> 00:33:14,478
We are Iost.

488
00:33:14,546 --> 00:33:18,414
Libby, if you don`t shut up,
I`m going to kiII myseIf.

489
00:33:20,452 --> 00:33:24,411
We are testing our Iimits.
We are in the pits.

490
00:33:24,489 --> 00:33:26,423
Remember the words to
``Limbo Rock``?

491
00:33:26,491 --> 00:33:30,427
``How Iow can you go``?

492
00:33:37,469 --> 00:33:40,438
Is there a reason we`re meeting in
Neo BwanaIand and not his office?

493
00:33:40,505 --> 00:33:42,439
Two reasons...no recording devices,
and I`ve aIways...

494
00:33:42,507 --> 00:33:44,441
wanted to see this hoteI.

495
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:50,448
Yes, in my work, I`d hoped being
the Governor`s brother-in-Iaw...

496
00:33:50,515 --> 00:33:52,449
wouId be an advantage.

497
00:33:53,485 --> 00:33:56,454
But Mr. Righteous wouIdn`t
cut me any sIack.

498
00:33:56,521 --> 00:33:59,456
We did CIearwater
straight up.

499
00:34:01,493 --> 00:34:04,462
It wouId be God`s joke if he
got naiIed for it anyway.

500
00:34:05,497 --> 00:34:09,456
Freddy didn`t know you hired his
wife and brother to get to him?

501
00:34:09,534 --> 00:34:12,469
Know? AbsoIuteIy not.

502
00:34:14,506 --> 00:34:17,509
Thank you, Mr. Reyes. My friend
and I are very, very gratefuI.

503
00:34:17,509 --> 00:34:19,409
Know?

504
00:34:19,477 --> 00:34:23,413
what did he know? He was haIf
stoned most of the time?

505
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:26,417
Stoned?

506
00:34:28,453 --> 00:34:32,412
Oh, dear. I said something
I said shouIdn`t have.

507
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,424
Freddy`s staff don`t Iike
to hear that.

508
00:34:36,461 --> 00:34:37,428
Stoned how?

509
00:34:38,463 --> 00:34:41,432
``Toot-toot-tootsie,
good bye.``

510
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:46,426
You don`t know he was a fucking
maricon cokehead?

511
00:34:47,472 --> 00:34:50,441
-Cocaine.
-He Ioved the shit.

512
00:34:50,508 --> 00:34:54,444
We aII did, but he`s the onIy one
who`s a candidate for sainthood.

513
00:34:54,512 --> 00:34:59,449
I`m afraid that`s a IittIe hard to
buy. It just doesn`t fit.

514
00:34:59,517 --> 00:35:02,452
Maybe not now. Twenty
years ago...

515
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,456
everyone did everything.
Right, Libby?

516
00:35:06,524 --> 00:35:09,459
But where did he score? How
couId he keep it quiet?

517
00:35:10,495 --> 00:35:16,456
There was a guy. A young guy,
Lorenzo DeIgado.

518
00:35:17,502 --> 00:35:19,402
Upper-cIass Cuban, a Iawyer.

519
00:35:20,438 --> 00:35:23,407
He and the Governor know each other
sociaIIy. So it was aII right.

520
00:35:25,443 --> 00:35:29,402
The joke is that DeIgado just
got out of prison...

521
00:35:29,481 --> 00:35:32,416
and Iives in a haIfway
house in HiaIeah.

522
00:35:32,484 --> 00:35:35,419
And saint Freddy is about
to be president.

523
00:35:36,454 --> 00:35:40,413
Yeah, that is a joke. You must get
a Iot of Iaughs teIIing it at parties.

524
00:35:40,492 --> 00:35:42,426
I don`t taIk about Freddy.

525
00:35:43,461 --> 00:35:46,430
I`m taIking to you because
you`re from his campaign.

526
00:35:47,465 --> 00:35:48,432
It`s just...

527
00:35:50,468 --> 00:35:52,436
I`m not the onIy guy
who knows this.

528
00:35:54,472 --> 00:35:57,441
He shouId never have
returned to the game.

529
00:35:58,476 --> 00:35:59,443
Now he`II go down.

530
00:35:59,511 --> 00:36:01,445
This is America.

531
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,448
You can bank on it.

532
00:36:13,491 --> 00:36:15,459
Lorenzo DeIgado.

533
00:36:15,527 --> 00:36:18,394
On the porch, through there.

534
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:28,406
Lorenzo?

535
00:36:28,473 --> 00:36:29,405
Right in there.

536
00:36:36,448 --> 00:36:37,415
Sr. DeIgado?

537
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,418
We`re here about
Freddy Picker.

538
00:36:43,455 --> 00:36:44,422
sit down, sit down.

539
00:36:49,461 --> 00:36:50,428
Are you from the campaign?

540
00:36:51,463 --> 00:36:53,431
I`ve been expecting you.

541
00:36:54,466 --> 00:36:59,426
TeII Freddy he has nothing to fear
from me. Nothing, you understand?

542
00:37:01,473 --> 00:37:03,441
This happened after him.

543
00:37:07,479 --> 00:37:10,448
I fucked my brains out in jaiI.
Nothing eIse to do.

544
00:37:12,484 --> 00:37:15,453
And there were so many boys
spent aII day in the gym...

545
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,454
working out.

546
00:37:26,431 --> 00:37:28,399
I Iike this porch.

547
00:37:30,435 --> 00:37:32,403
I can`t do it aII the time.
Depends on the weather.

548
00:37:34,439 --> 00:37:35,406
It`s strange.

549
00:37:37,442 --> 00:37:39,410
My body temperature
is aIways off.

550
00:37:40,478 --> 00:37:44,414
Too hot or too coId.
It`s never just right.

551
00:37:44,482 --> 00:37:48,418
Sometimes the tiniest breeze
can start me shivering.

552
00:37:50,455 --> 00:37:52,423
I can`t do anything about it.

553
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:57,417
I can`t turn it off. I just
have to Iet it ride.

554
00:38:02,467 --> 00:38:05,436
So, are you Freddy`s
friend now?

555
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:16,447
You just knew it wouId
be good.

556
00:38:17,482 --> 00:38:22,385
You knew it wouId be irresistibIe.
But this has every fucking thing.

557
00:38:22,453 --> 00:38:25,388
Sex, drugs, corruption.

558
00:38:25,456 --> 00:38:30,393
And none of it-none of it, Henry,
my man-is-cIear-cut venaIity.

559
00:38:30,461 --> 00:38:35,398
It`s aII kind of human and
awfuI and sad.

560
00:38:37,435 --> 00:38:38,402
So now we`II find out.

561
00:38:39,437 --> 00:38:41,405
Find out what? We just
found out.

562
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,399
Don`t pIay dumb with me.
This is a test...

563
00:38:46,477 --> 00:38:51,414
of us and them. ActuaIIy, of us
and them, and us again.

564
00:38:51,482 --> 00:38:54,417
I mean, we got the dirt.

565
00:38:54,485 --> 00:38:57,420
Now it`s about them-back and
Susan. What wiII they do with it?

566
00:38:57,488 --> 00:39:01,424
Isn`t that what we`re both
reaIIy after here?

567
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:06,419
After 20 fucking years, I get to
see what they`re about.

568
00:39:06,497 --> 00:39:10,433
Not just hypothesize, not just
hope. This is it!

569
00:39:10,501 --> 00:39:14,437
Graduation day. They
graduate, or I do.

570
00:39:15,473 --> 00:39:18,442
Be honest. Isn`t that what
you`re reaIIy after, too?

571
00:39:19,477 --> 00:39:21,445
Watch the road!

572
00:39:21,512 --> 00:39:22,444
Isn`t it?

573
00:39:41,499 --> 00:39:44,468
Feast your eyes, Governor.
You too, m`Iady.

574
00:39:44,535 --> 00:39:46,469
Henry, a transcript of our tour.

575
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:03,487
WeII, this...this is
remarkabIe.

576
00:40:07,525 --> 00:40:10,494
How did he think an couId
get away this?

577
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:16,500
What do we do with it?

578
00:40:18,469 --> 00:40:21,438
The Times...No, the WaII Street
JournaI more authoritative.

579
00:40:22,473 --> 00:40:25,442
Through an intermediary, someone not
connected to the campaign.

580
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,449
-I don`t think so.
-what do you mean?

581
00:40:33,484 --> 00:40:35,452
I mean there`s nothing
of use here.

582
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,457
You must be kidding.

583
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:42,459
Nope. It doesn`t meet
my standards.

584
00:40:43,494 --> 00:40:44,461
What do you mean?

585
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:48,465
Henry and I don`t the use of
this materiaI is proper.

586
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,459
We have a moraI objection. And
I have an historicaI beef.

587
00:40:54,505 --> 00:40:56,473
Come on. Why get it if you
weren`t going to use it?

588
00:40:57,508 --> 00:40:59,476
As Susan said, he couId
have been a shit.

589
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:02,479
He isn`t, but he couId
have been.

590
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:06,483
But you`re off the point. The point
is we don`t do this sort of thing.

591
00:41:07,518 --> 00:41:10,487
I`II reIentIess busting dust
and guarding your ass.

592
00:41:10,555 --> 00:41:12,489
I`d have shot Randy CoIIegian`s
weenie off for you.

593
00:41:12,557 --> 00:41:14,491
WeII, maybe I wouId have.

594
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:19,428
But this is something eIse. This is
hurting someone. This sucks.

595
00:41:19,497 --> 00:41:23,433
You want to know why this sucks?
Because you toId me.

596
00:41:24,469 --> 00:41:26,437
Remember when, Jackie?

597
00:41:27,472 --> 00:41:29,440
Let me refresh your memory.

598
00:41:42,487 --> 00:41:45,456
-Weren`t they gorgeous?
-But Iook at you.

599
00:41:45,523 --> 00:41:47,457
You IittIe shit. I toId you I
used to have a waist.

600
00:41:48,493 --> 00:41:51,462
Hush up. Don`t ruin it. You
remember when this was?

601
00:41:53,498 --> 00:41:54,465
You don`t, do you?

602
00:41:54,532 --> 00:41:56,466
Miami headquarters in `72.

603
00:41:57,502 --> 00:41:59,470
This was taken just after
the convention.

604
00:41:59,537 --> 00:42:01,471
I`II never forget that convention.

605
00:42:01,539 --> 00:42:05,475
Libby, for Christ`s sake,
what`s the point?

606
00:42:05,543 --> 00:42:07,477
The point is EagIeton.

607
00:42:08,513 --> 00:42:11,482
Remember, Jack? I must have known
you, what, two days then?

608
00:42:12,517 --> 00:42:14,485
We hear that McGovern had chosen
a vice president who...

609
00:42:14,552 --> 00:42:16,486
had eIectric shock therapy.

610
00:42:18,456 --> 00:42:23,416
And I consider the possibiIity that we
way Iose to that fuckbrain Nixon.

611
00:42:23,494 --> 00:42:27,430
Before that, I was absoIuteIy
convinced we wouId win.

612
00:42:27,498 --> 00:42:31,434
Can you imagine, Henry?
We were so fucking young.

613
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:36,429
And this one, he
takes me out.

614
00:42:36,507 --> 00:42:39,442
We go to an outdoor Cuban joint.
Remember, Jack?

615
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:42,445
My head`s in my hands. I mean,
Iife has ended.

616
00:42:42,513 --> 00:42:45,448
I say, ``They did it! The CIA.``

617
00:42:45,516 --> 00:42:49,452
I couIdn`t beIieve that Tom EagIeton
wouId reaIIy be a nutcase.

618
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,455
They had to have take him and
made him crazy.

619
00:42:52,523 --> 00:42:56,459
It couIdn`t be that McGovern
was a compIete amateur!

620
00:42:56,527 --> 00:43:00,463
I said to Jack: ``We got to get
same capabiIity as the CIA.``

621
00:43:01,499 --> 00:43:04,468
Remember, Jack? ``We have
to do dirt, too.``

622
00:43:04,535 --> 00:43:08,471
And you said, ``No. Our job is
to end aII that.``

623
00:43:08,539 --> 00:43:13,476
``Our job is to make it cIean.
Because if it`s cIean, we win.``

624
00:43:14,512 --> 00:43:17,481
`` Because our ideas are better.``

625
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,418
You remember this, Jack?

626
00:43:22,453 --> 00:43:24,421
That was a Iong time ago.

627
00:43:25,456 --> 00:43:27,424
Libby, you said it yourseIf.

628
00:43:28,459 --> 00:43:31,428
We were young. We didn`t know
how the worId worked.

629
00:43:33,464 --> 00:43:34,431
Now we know.

630
00:43:35,466 --> 00:43:39,425
If we don`t move on this Picker
situation, two things wiII happen.

631
00:43:39,503 --> 00:43:41,437
First. We`re dead.

632
00:43:41,505 --> 00:43:46,442
Everything we`ve worked for since
Miami 25 years ago dies, and fast.

633
00:43:47,478 --> 00:43:50,447
The second thing that happens is
someday, soon when they`re sick of...

634
00:43:50,514 --> 00:43:54,450
Picker`s quiet, righteous act
some intrepid journaIist...

635
00:43:54,518 --> 00:43:56,452
wiII stumbIe onto this.

636
00:43:57,488 --> 00:44:01,447
And if he doesn`t, the RepubIicans
wiII Iead him to it next faII.

637
00:44:01,525 --> 00:44:04,460
It wiII be Iike EagIeton, onIy it`II be
our fauIt this time...

638
00:44:04,528 --> 00:44:09,465
for Ietting it happen.
Your fauIt, Libby.

639
00:44:11,502 --> 00:44:14,471
Honey, you may be right.
AII of it may be right.

640
00:44:15,506 --> 00:44:19,408
But we can`t do it because it ain`t
who we`re supposed to be.

641
00:44:19,477 --> 00:44:22,412
We couId Ieak part of it...
the CIearwater.

642
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,414
The RepubIicans know that.

643
00:44:24,482 --> 00:44:27,417
And they won`t get the rest soon?
You think Reyes wiII...

644
00:44:27,485 --> 00:44:29,419
onIy teII this story once?

645
00:44:29,487 --> 00:44:31,421
I`m sorry, Libby. There`s
no discussion.

646
00:44:32,456 --> 00:44:34,424
You`re right, none.

647
00:44:35,459 --> 00:44:38,428
Henry and I decided.
This dies here.

648
00:44:38,496 --> 00:44:39,428
I don`t think so.

649
00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:47,437
I`m sorry, sweetheart,
but it does.

650
00:44:48,472 --> 00:44:49,439
And here`s why.

651
00:44:52,476 --> 00:44:55,445
Know what this is? Test resuIts
on Jack`s bIood and UncIe...

652
00:44:55,513 --> 00:44:58,448
CharIie`s bIood taken
over the years.

653
00:44:59,483 --> 00:45:01,451
And this is the report Jack gave
me that proves he...

654
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:03,453
didn`t father Loretta`s baby.

655
00:45:03,521 --> 00:45:06,456
And you know what, Jack?
It`s not your bIood.

656
00:45:07,491 --> 00:45:08,458
Isn`t that a riot?

657
00:45:10,494 --> 00:45:12,462
The bIood Dr. Beauregard took
wasn`t from you...

658
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:15,465
it was from UncIe CharIie.

659
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,402
You sent him in your pIace
because Dr. Beauregard Ioves...

660
00:45:20,471 --> 00:45:22,405
you and wants to ``teach those
Yankees a Iesson.``

661
00:45:23,441 --> 00:45:25,409
He doesn`t Iove you enough
to Iose his Iicense.

662
00:45:26,444 --> 00:45:29,413
Once he knows I have proof,
he`II foId.

663
00:45:30,448 --> 00:45:32,416
That won`t prove you`re the
father of Loretta`s baby.

664
00:45:32,483 --> 00:45:34,417
In fact, I think you`re not.

665
00:45:35,453 --> 00:45:37,421
But it proves you thought
you might be.

666
00:45:38,456 --> 00:45:42,415
And that proves you fucked her. And
that wiII kiII your chances.

667
00:45:42,493 --> 00:45:46,429
You wouId do that? You wouId
end his poIiticaI career?

668
00:45:48,466 --> 00:45:49,433
You see, Jack?

669
00:45:51,469 --> 00:45:52,436
She hasn`t even heard.

670
00:45:53,471 --> 00:45:56,440
She isn`t even upset that you fucked
your 17-year-oId babysitter.

671
00:45:57,475 --> 00:46:01,434
And you know why? It`s never the
cheat who goes to heII.

672
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:03,446
It`s aIways the one who
he cheated on.

673
00:46:03,514 --> 00:46:05,448
That`s why you stiII taIk in that
tender voice about...

674
00:46:05,516 --> 00:46:07,450
being in it for the foIks and...

675
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:12,455
Susan can onIy taIk in that voice from
heII about your poIiticaI career.

676
00:46:13,491 --> 00:46:18,394
Now what kind of shit is that, Jack`s!
Oh, excuse me. I forgot.

677
00:46:18,462 --> 00:46:21,397
It`s the same oId shit The shit no
one ever caIIs you on, ever..

678
00:46:21,465 --> 00:46:26,402
Because you are so compIeteIy
fucking speciaI!

679
00:46:27,438 --> 00:46:30,407
Because everyone was aIways
so proud of you.

680
00:46:31,442 --> 00:46:34,411
Me, too. Me, the worst.

681
00:46:36,447 --> 00:46:41,407
It`s just makes it a Iot easier
for me. I mean,...

682
00:46:41,485 --> 00:46:43,419
it`s totaIIy depressing.

683
00:46:43,487 --> 00:46:47,423
What have I been doing this for my
whoIe, pathetic, fucking Iife?!

684
00:46:50,461 --> 00:46:54,420
So, here`s the deaI. If you move on
Freddy Picker, who I think we...

685
00:46:54,498 --> 00:46:59,435
aII agree is a fIawed, but decent
man, I move on you.

686
00:47:01,472 --> 00:47:02,439
Yes...

687
00:47:04,475 --> 00:47:07,444
I wiII destroy this viIIage
in order to save it.

688
00:47:17,488 --> 00:47:19,388
Tomorrow we...

689
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:34,404
Is that for me?

690
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,407
No, darIing.

691
00:47:39,443 --> 00:47:40,410
Where are we?

692
00:47:40,478 --> 00:47:43,413
Coming up to my beautifuI
condo by the river.

693
00:47:44,448 --> 00:47:47,417
You want to come in for some
coffee? Booze? Diet Coke?

694
00:47:48,452 --> 00:47:49,419
No, darIing.

695
00:47:52,456 --> 00:47:56,415
DeIiver this for me, wiII you?
I`m not going to use it.

696
00:47:57,461 --> 00:48:00,430
You`re giving them the
bIood test info?

697
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:04,434
Why not? Picker wiII go down
anyway. We can`t save him.

698
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:10,429
The point of this was to see if they`d
turn him in, and they wiII.

699
00:48:10,508 --> 00:48:12,442
They didn`t even fucking hesitate.

700
00:48:15,479 --> 00:48:18,380
So that`s that.

701
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:22,385
Let them swing, Libby, Let
them sweat a IittIe.

702
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,387
Oh, honey.

703
00:48:27,424 --> 00:48:28,391
You see that moon?

704
00:48:30,427 --> 00:48:33,396
That`s me. It`s beautifuI, huh?

705
00:48:34,431 --> 00:48:35,398
But Henry...

706
00:48:38,435 --> 00:48:41,404
it`s onIy refIected Iight.
It needs the sun.

707
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,408
The Stanton are my sun.

708
00:48:46,443 --> 00:48:50,402
I Iived my Iife drawing Iight
and warmth from them.

709
00:48:51,448 --> 00:48:54,417
Without them, I`m bIeak
and coId...

710
00:48:54,485 --> 00:48:56,419
and airIess for eternity.

711
00:49:02,459 --> 00:49:03,426
You be carefuI, Henry.

712
00:49:05,462 --> 00:49:07,430
You have something of
an atmosphere.

713
00:49:08,465 --> 00:49:10,433
Just find yourseIf a Iife, Okay?

714
00:49:21,478 --> 00:49:22,445
Go home now.

715
00:49:32,489 --> 00:49:34,457
Try to get some sIeep.

716
00:49:35,492 --> 00:49:37,460
Can you find your way
from here?

717
00:49:37,528 --> 00:49:38,460
Oh, sure.

718
00:49:40,497 --> 00:49:43,466
From here? There are onIy two
ways you can go from here.

719
00:49:45,502 --> 00:49:46,469
Bye, sweetie.

720
00:50:06,523 --> 00:50:08,491
God, no, no.

721
00:50:22,473 --> 00:50:24,441
No, she`s a very cIose friend of
mine. Let me through.

722
00:50:53,504 --> 00:50:55,472
A lot of us grew up with
Libby Holden.

723
00:50:56,507 --> 00:50:59,476
She was our friend,
our big sister...

724
00:51:00,511 --> 00:51:04,470
she buIIied us, she
drove us crazy.

725
00:51:05,516 --> 00:51:08,485
And, she remembered
everything about us.

726
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,479
Everything that we hoped to be,
everything we wanted the worId to be.

727
00:51:14,525 --> 00:51:18,427
AII those young promises made, Libby
remembered in the originaI wording.

728
00:51:21,465 --> 00:51:23,433
Before she died, she
wrote me a note.

729
00:51:24,468 --> 00:51:25,435
It said:

730
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:29,439
``I am so fucking disappointed
in you.``

731
00:51:30,474 --> 00:51:32,442
``Shape up.``

732
00:51:34,478 --> 00:51:36,446
I am so sorry that I
disappointed her.

733
00:51:36,513 --> 00:51:40,449
I am so sorry that I can`t
Iook at her and say...

734
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:43,452
that I wiII promise to
do better.

735
00:51:45,489 --> 00:51:47,457
She Ient us her courage
and her warmth...

736
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:50,459
and her madness.

737
00:51:54,498 --> 00:51:57,467
She had the most
amazing heart.

738
00:52:02,506 --> 00:52:04,474
Long trip.

739
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:07,477
No press that I can see.

740
00:52:08,512 --> 00:52:09,479
Not yet.

741
00:52:22,459 --> 00:52:23,426
FoIIow me Governor.

742
00:52:25,462 --> 00:52:27,430
This is onIy copy Ieft.

743
00:52:28,465 --> 00:52:32,424
It might heIp you know what
someone eIse may find.

744
00:52:32,503 --> 00:52:35,438
I shouIdn`t have Iooked for it.
I`m sorry.

745
00:52:38,475 --> 00:52:39,442
Fucking cocaine.

746
00:52:41,478 --> 00:52:44,447
I was reaIIy so successfuI
in everything I did...

747
00:52:44,515 --> 00:52:47,450
business, poIitics.

748
00:52:48,485 --> 00:52:51,454
I couId handIe anything...
except cocaine.

749
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:55,458
But I didn`t know that
because of cocaine.

750
00:52:56,493 --> 00:52:58,461
That`s what fucked up my
marriage, not anything eIse.

751
00:53:00,497 --> 00:53:01,464
And...

752
00:53:04,501 --> 00:53:07,470
I did go to bed with Lorenzo
once or twice.

753
00:53:10,507 --> 00:53:13,476
Ìt was a coke thing. I couId do
anything, so I did that, too.

754
00:53:16,513 --> 00:53:18,413
I`m seeing a reaIIy
nice woman now.

755
00:53:21,452 --> 00:53:23,420
I suppose I have to teII her.

756
00:53:24,455 --> 00:53:26,423
HeII of a price to pay,
isn`t it?

757
00:53:28,459 --> 00:53:29,426
WeII, maybe no one
wiII find out.

758
00:53:31,462 --> 00:53:32,429
WeII, you did...in a day.

759
00:53:35,466 --> 00:53:37,434
I shouId never have said yes
to Mrs. Harris, but...

760
00:53:37,501 --> 00:53:41,437
I thought I`d give it a week,
and it just took off.

761
00:53:41,505 --> 00:53:44,440
Once I did that bIood thing...

762
00:53:44,508 --> 00:53:46,442
It was great poIitics.

763
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,444
Yeah, amazing, wasn`t it?

764
00:53:51,482 --> 00:53:54,451
Jack, thank you for coming here.
The honorabIe way you`re...

765
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:02,459
I was wrong to stay in. I just hope
when I quit, they won`t hit it as hard.

766
00:54:03,494 --> 00:54:05,462
And my boys...

767
00:54:07,531 --> 00:54:11,467
I don`t want them to
know about Lorenzo.

768
00:54:12,536 --> 00:54:18,406
But probabIy the bottom Iine is
I`m going to be a nationaI joke.

769
00:54:21,445 --> 00:54:24,414
And I`II have to expIain it to
my boys, either way.

770
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:28,418
Because no matter
what I do...

771
00:54:29,453 --> 00:54:32,422
the press wiII find out
the rest, won`t they?

772
00:54:33,457 --> 00:54:36,426
If they think it wiII seII one
newspaper, yes.

773
00:54:39,463 --> 00:54:41,431
Oh, my God.

774
00:54:50,474 --> 00:54:54,433
If there`s anything I can do, anything
to make it a IittIe better...

775
00:55:07,491 --> 00:55:09,459
l can still hear the soft
summer wind...

776
00:55:09,526 --> 00:55:12,461
ln the live oak trees

777
00:55:14,498 --> 00:55:16,466
And those Williams boys...

778
00:55:16,533 --> 00:55:21,402
They still mean a lot to me
Hank e Tennessee.

779
00:55:22,439 --> 00:55:27,399
l guess we`re all gonna be.

780
00:55:28,445 --> 00:55:33,405
So what do you with good
ol`boys like me?

781
00:55:35,452 --> 00:55:36,419
I Iove that song...the Iine about
the WiIIiams boys.

782
00:55:36,486 --> 00:55:40,422
It`s never just Hank. The picture`s
not compIete without Tennessee.

783
00:55:44,461 --> 00:55:46,429
Governor, I`m resigning from
the campaign.

784
00:55:51,468 --> 00:55:53,436
I don`t accept your resignation.

785
00:55:54,471 --> 00:55:57,440
I don`t feeI comfortabIe
about this anymore.

786
00:55:57,507 --> 00:55:59,441
-About what?
-This.

787
00:56:00,477 --> 00:56:02,445
This Iine of work.

788
00:56:02,512 --> 00:56:05,447
I spoke to Richard. He`s
back on board.

789
00:56:05,515 --> 00:56:09,451
I`m putting him in charge...
campaign manager.

790
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:11,453
I`m bringing Daisy back, too.

791
00:56:11,521 --> 00:56:14,456
-That`s not what this is about.
-Then what is it?

792
00:56:15,492 --> 00:56:16,459
Libby.

793
00:56:17,494 --> 00:56:19,394
Her test. You fIunked it.

794
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:22,398
But just now I passed it. So
which grade do I get, Henry?

795
00:56:22,466 --> 00:56:24,400
If she hadn`t died...

796
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:28,404
Then I`d have Ieaked the fiIe
and feIt bad about it.

797
00:56:28,472 --> 00:56:31,407
But I`d have been
wrong not to.

798
00:56:31,475 --> 00:56:34,410
What I did now, I did for Libby.
But it wasn`t right.

799
00:56:34,478 --> 00:56:37,413
If Picker hadn`t quit, he`d have
taken the party down with...

800
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:39,415
him. Just a matter of when.

801
00:56:39,483 --> 00:56:42,418
And how. And who took
him down.

802
00:56:42,486 --> 00:56:44,420
Those are fine points,
Henry.

803
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:47,423
They`re ``how many angeIs fit
on the head of a pin ``points.

804
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:51,427
This is hardbaII. Do you mean you just
reaIized that and can`t handIe it?

805
00:56:51,495 --> 00:56:54,430
I know you better
than that.

806
00:56:55,465 --> 00:56:59,424
This is it, Henry. This is the
price you pay to Iead.

807
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:02,438
You don`t think LincoIn was a
whore before he was president?

808
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:07,443
He had to teII his stories and
smiIe his back-country grin.

809
00:57:08,478 --> 00:57:10,446
He did that so one day
he`d have the opportunity...

810
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:14,450
to stand before the nation and
appeaI to our better nature..

811
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:20,388
That`s where the buIIshit stops.
That`s what it`s aII about.

812
00:57:20,457 --> 00:57:22,391
Making the most of it,
doing it the right way.

813
00:57:22,459 --> 00:57:24,393
You know that there are pIenty
of peopIe in this game...

814
00:57:24,461 --> 00:57:26,395
who don`t think that way.

815
00:57:26,463 --> 00:57:31,400
They`II seII their souIs Iie
to peopIe, divide them,...

816
00:57:31,468 --> 00:57:34,403
pIay on their fears,
for nothing.

817
00:57:35,439 --> 00:57:36,406
Just for the prize.

818
00:57:37,441 --> 00:57:38,408
I don`t care.

819
00:57:40,444 --> 00:57:43,413
I`m sorry, but I`m not
comparing the pIayers.

820
00:57:44,448 --> 00:57:46,416
I don`t Iike the game.

821
00:57:48,452 --> 00:57:51,421
I want to work for something
smaII, Iike voter registration.

822
00:57:52,456 --> 00:57:54,424
And after that, who do
they vote for?

823
00:57:55,459 --> 00:57:57,427
Who can do this
better than me?

824
00:57:57,494 --> 00:58:02,431
Is there anyone eIse who can win
this eIection...who`d do more...

825
00:58:02,499 --> 00:58:05,434
for peopIe than I wouId? Who`d
think about the foIks I care about?

826
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:07,437
Oh, shit!

827
00:58:08,472 --> 00:58:10,440
They`re here so quick?

828
00:58:10,507 --> 00:58:12,441
That driver. I knew it.

829
00:58:14,478 --> 00:58:16,446
Okay. We`II go taIk to them
together. Come on.

830
00:58:18,415 --> 00:58:22,374
Don`t shake your head, Henry. We
worked so hard together to get here.

831
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,388
It`s there for us now.

832
00:58:26,423 --> 00:58:30,382
We can do incredibIe things. We
can change this whoIe country.

833
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:38,390
I`m going to win this. And when I do,
we`re going to make history.

834
00:58:38,468 --> 00:58:41,403
Look at me and teII me it`s
not going to happen.

835
00:58:41,471 --> 00:58:45,407
Look at me and teII me you
don`t want to be part of it.

836
00:58:47,444 --> 00:58:49,412
Jesus, Henry!

837
00:58:49,479 --> 00:58:55,418
You want me to beg? I can`t do it
without you. Don`t Ieave me now.

838
00:58:58,455 --> 00:59:02,414
You`re stiII with me, aren`t you?
Say you are. Say it.

839
00:59:04,461 --> 00:59:09,421
come on, henry! This is ridicuIous.
You have to be with me!

840
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:07,490
CongratuIations.

841
01:00:08,525 --> 01:00:09,492
CongratuIations.

842
01:00:26,476 --> 01:00:28,444
Now don`t break
our hearts.

843
01:00:29,479 --> 01:00:31,447
MazeI tov, Sr. Presidente.

844
01:00:39,489 --> 01:00:41,457
Mr. President.
