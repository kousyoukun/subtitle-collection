[ Man ]
 You know, I've seen him
 do it a million times now,

2
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:59,327
but I can't tell you
 how he does it, Henry.

3
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,562
The right-handed part.

4
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:04,432
I can tell you a whole lot
 about what he does
 with his left hand, though.

5
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,800
He's a genius with it.

6
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:12,240
He might put that left hand
 on your elbow or on your
 bicep, like he's doing now.

7
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:14,308
Very basic move.
 He's interested in you.

8
00:01:14,342 --> 00:01:16,844
He's honored to meet you.

9
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:20,848
If he gets any higher,
 if he gets on your shoulder,
 like that,

10
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,284
it's not as intimate.

11
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,653
It means he'll share
 a laugh with you or a secret,
 a light secret,

12
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,256
not a real one,
 but very flattering.

13
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:30,724
If he doesn't know you that
 well and wants to share
 something emotional with you,

14
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,194
he'll lock you
 in a two-hander.

15
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:36,497
Well, you'll see when he
 shakes hands with you, Henry.

 this is Henry Burton.

17
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:45,206
I met your grandfather
 when I was a boy.

18
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,875
I hitchhiked to Washington
 to hear him speak.

19

He was a great man.
 Thank you, sir.

How are you?

21
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,184
Good to see you.
 He's really glad you're
 coming on board. I can tell.

22
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:59,320
I didn't say I was coming
 on board. Did you tell him
 I was coming on board?

23
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:01,589
No, take it easy.

24
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,158
What is he doing here anyway?
 He's a Southern governor
 nobody's heard of.

25
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:06,660
Already you're sounding
 like a campaign manager.

 I'm kidding,

27

If I told you Jack Stanton's
 here 'cause he's interested
 in adult literacy,

28
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:17,405
you'd tell me
I was full of shit.
 Yes.

29

Howard Ferguson, Henry Burton,
 this is Marianne Walsh,

30
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,376
the very special librarian
 who's running these classes.

31
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,181
Thank you, Governor Walsh--
Oh, Governor Stanton.
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:30,284
I'm a little nervous.
 I'm sorry. Um.

33

If you'll walk with me,
I'll take you up
to the, uh, library.

 Uh, yes, yes.

 of the library.

38
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,603
How long ago did you start up
 this reading program?
 About three years ago.

We have no money.
 Uh, very little money.

40

That's general studies.

They could've sent me

than just giving welfare
 recipients a safety net.

 a ladder.

I'm against dismissing
any idea that might help...

734
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:08,139
because
 it isn't my idea.

735
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:11,610
Senator,
 you have met these people,
 looked into their eyes.

736
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:14,012
Are you saying we should
 do nothin' to help unless
 we come up with it?

737
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:16,915
Nailed him!
He's toast!

738
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:19,451
[ Richard ]
 Hell, yes!
 What I meant was--

739
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:21,052
[ Arlen ]
 Kickin' ass
 and takin' names!

740
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:24,523
Grand slam.
As good as it gets.

741
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,692
Hi. How was I?

742
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:29,127
You took it, honey.
 It was yours. Sure.

743
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,862
Governor, March Cunningham,
 The Black Advocate.

744
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:36,835
- Were you ever arrested
 during the Vietnam War?
 - No.

745
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:41,172
- You were never
 arrested in Chicago?
 - I was accidentally detained.

746
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:44,543
Then released.
 The record was expunged.

747
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:47,212
You remember how
 you were released?

748
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:50,549
They realized
it was a mistake.
It was a long time ago.

749
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:53,519
Check your records.
 [ Susan ] Honey,
 we're gonna be late.

750
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:56,187
Henry?
 You guys go ahead.
 I'll meet you. Go on.

751
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:00,859
[ Car Engine Starts,
 Doors Closing ]

752
00:41:06,565 --> 00:41:08,834
What are you
 doing here?

753
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:11,970
Why is The Black Advocate
 suddenly interested
 in Stanton?

754
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:14,540
They're not. I am.

755
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:16,808
I'm trying to find out
 who he is because a friend
 of mine works for him.

756
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:19,044
Oh, March. Come on.
Don't do this.

757
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:21,246
I thought you might
 be interested too.

758
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:23,749
Do you know why
 he was released?

759
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:25,984
He called a senator
 to get him out of jail...

760
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:28,954
and then persuaded
 the mayor of Chicago
 to have his record expunged.

761
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,557
So?
 "So?"

762
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:34,292
You don't care that this guy
 was already so manipulative
 in the '60s...

763
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,862
that he got into bed
 with the mayor of Chicago,

764
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:39,865
the same mayor
 that busted the protestors
 at the Democratic Convention?

765
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:44,069
No, I don't care.
 Stanton was never a radical.
 He's a politician.

766
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:46,872
He couldn't get
 elected with a record,
 so he had that expunged.

767
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:49,808
That's the kind of man you
 want to work for, somebody
 who just wants to get elected?

768
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,844
No, I want to work for a man
 who fights the good fight,

769
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:54,813
then watch a
 Republican get elected.

770
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,315
What's the difference?
 Can you tell?
 I can tell the difference...

771
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,886
between a man who believes
 what I believe and lies
 to get elected...

772
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:03,822
and a man who-- who just
 doesn't give a fuck.

773
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:07,258
I'll take the liar.
 How did he
 do this to you?

774
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:09,961
Do what? What?
 What are you--

775
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,999
Why are you making this guy
into the devil?

776
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:18,136
Why don't you at least
 get to know him, maybe
 spend a few days with us?

777
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,273
Honey, I miss you,
 and we could be together.

778
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:25,210
[ Scoffs ]
 God.

779
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:28,046
I think you'd fuck me
 to get some good press
 for Stanton.

780
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:40,258
We're in trouble.

781
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,229
What does she have?

782
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:49,300
What the fuck is
 The Black Advocate doing
 covering Stanton?

783
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:51,737
They're not.
 It's-- She's--

784
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,271
It's personal.

785
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:58,610
Well, it don't matter.
 We're fucked.

786
00:42:58,644 --> 00:43:01,212
If some little shitty paper
 like The Black Advocate's

787
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:03,081
got a reporter
 who can dig this up,

788
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:05,717
then we're fuckin'
 flying blind in the wind.

789
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:08,186
Now they're all
 gonna come after us.

790
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:10,656
Did you see any
 other president up there
 on the stage tonight?

791
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:13,692
We're the fucking ball game.

792
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:17,996
Now every flea
 that ever nipped his ass
 is gonna want a piece of us.

793
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:21,099
It's gonna be the war thing,
 the drug thing,
 the woman thing.

794
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:23,835
That's the killer right there.
 You're gonna have to talk
 to him about that.

795
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:26,705
Me? No. Hey,
 you're the strategy guy.

796
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:28,373
But you're the body man.

797
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:30,642
Maybe we can talk
 to Susan.

798
00:43:30,676 --> 00:43:33,378
Are you out
 of your fuckin' mind?

799
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:37,382
"Mrs. Stanton, we need to know
 who the governor's plugging
 so we can have spin control."

800
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:39,718
All right, then,
 let's just quit.

801
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:42,721
If everyone's gonna take
 a bite out of him, we're
 not gonna say anything,

802
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:45,123
let's go work for someone
 we're not too chickenshit
 to protect.

803
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,298
All right.
 We'll set up a meeting.
Him or her?

804
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:55,767
Shit, her!
 Her!

805
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:58,970
Goddamn,
 this is gonna be rough.

806
00:43:59,004 --> 00:44:02,774
So, I have to be in Concord
 in an hour to meet Jack.

807
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:04,342
What's the crisis?

808
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:14,019
It's campaign business.
It's, uh, private.

809
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:17,022
Please, if it's not
 too private for you--

810
00:44:17,055 --> 00:44:20,959
Lucille is one
 of my closest friends
 and part of this campaign.

811
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,761
What's the crisis?

812
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,418
Say you're out in the woods
taking a shit...

813
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:51,256
and a wild boar
 comes charging at ya.

814
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:54,993
Now, do you pull
 your britches up and run?

815
00:44:57,228 --> 00:45:02,067
Or do you try to pull
 your britches up and grab
 the doves you just shot...

816
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:07,338
and then try to run,
 all at the same time?

817
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:11,209
Or do you just forget
 about the fuckin' doves,
 pull your britches up and run,

818
00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:14,345
'cause you ain't got time
to aim and button your fly?

819
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:20,819
And if you miss,

820
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:26,357
well... you don't want to die
 with your dick hanging out.

821
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:28,193
You see what
 I'm sayin'?

822
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:31,496
I think I speak for everyone
 in the room when I say no.

823
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:34,099
Well, I mean, uh,

824
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:37,268
what if you're not
 prepared for the boar...

825
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:40,538
and you get caught
 with your britches down
 and lose the doves?

826
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:44,843
All right, what Richard
 is saying is--

827
00:45:44,876 --> 00:45:48,780
[ Sighs ]
 If you get caught
 in the forest--

828
00:45:48,814 --> 00:45:51,249
Don't give us a "taking
a shit in the woods"
metaphor again.

829
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:55,420
Tell us what you
 are talking about.
 Okay.

830
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:58,023
- Say that this boar is part--
 - I don't believe this.

831
00:45:58,056 --> 00:46:00,859
Who do the boars represent,
 the Republicans?

832
00:46:00,892 --> 00:46:02,961
[ Henry ]
 No, the press.
 The press?

833
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:05,831
Yes. Don't they?

834
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:08,499
Yeah, the press.
 [ Sniffs ]

835
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:11,269
Now, you're dealing
 with these wild boars.

836
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:15,540
Oh, God.
 Suddenly they start saying
 things like "marijuana."

837
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:18,409
"Chicago." Maybe a woman
 comes forward and says--

838
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:21,279
Bullshit. That's
 not gonna happen.

839
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:23,982
Absolutely not.
 I don't think so
 either.

840
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:25,416
But...

841
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:30,288
I'm just trying
 to figure this out.

842
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:33,925
If it did happen,

843
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:37,028
then he's not gonna
 get trapped like Hart,
 'cause we know the rules.

844
00:46:37,062 --> 00:46:40,431
If some bimbo from a
 former life comes forward,
 we just say, "Bullshit."

845
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:44,169
[ Lucille ]
 Bullshit is right.
 What are you suggesting we do?

846
00:46:44,202 --> 00:46:47,238
How would you deal with it?
 By knowing more
 than they do.

847
00:46:47,272 --> 00:46:51,843
By being prepared, so when
 a story like Chicago comes up,
 we fight back with the truth.

848
00:46:51,877 --> 00:46:55,180
How are we supposed to know
what kind of garbage
they're gonna come up with?

849
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:59,517
That's the point, Lucille.
 That's the whole
 ever-fuckin' point.

850
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,587
We need to hire an operative
 to do research, you see?

851
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:05,556
We need somebody
 that can get at--
 Investigate our lives.

852
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:09,427
Investigate everything
 anybody can make
 an allegation about.

853
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,429
That's ridiculous.
 We don't play that game.

854
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:14,365
That's the media's game.
 We play the people's game.

855
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:17,335
We say, "The Republicans
 and the media want the
 election to be about trash.

856
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:19,470
"We want it to be
 about your future.

857
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:22,340
We don't shoot doves
 in this campaign.
 We protect them."

858
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:24,542
What do you mean?

859
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:32,217
Well, don't the doves
 represent the people?

860
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,220
[ Richard ] No.
Then I don't understand
who the doves are.

861
00:47:35,253 --> 00:47:38,356
Forget the doves.
 Henry, you agree with this?

862
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:41,392
Yes.
 [ Susan ]
 Okay.

863
00:47:41,426 --> 00:47:43,661
We'll do it.
 I'll tell the governor.

864
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,264
I want Libby Holden.
Oh, my God!

865
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:49,334
If we're gonna get someone
 to find the dirt, we have
 to have someone who knows us,

866
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,903
someone we trust
 completely.

867
00:47:51,937 --> 00:47:55,040
But I mean, is she
 out of the hospital?
 Yes.

868
00:47:55,073 --> 00:47:57,909
[ Lucille ]
 She's okay now?
Who is she?

869
00:47:57,943 --> 00:48:00,645
She was Jack's chief
 of staff 20 years ago.
 She had a breakdown.

870
00:48:00,678 --> 00:48:03,982
She just suddenly became
 incoherent in the middle
 of a press conference.

871
00:48:04,015 --> 00:48:06,985
It was awful.
She's been in and out of
mental hospitals for years.

872
00:48:07,018 --> 00:48:09,620
She seems very stable now.
 She's been home for 18 months.

873
00:48:09,654 --> 00:48:12,190
You and Henry can fly back
 tomorrow and brief her.

874
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:16,294
Well, that's good...
 that she's stable,

875
00:48:16,327 --> 00:48:19,230
because you're kind of
 putting the whole campaign
 in her hands now.

876
00:48:19,264 --> 00:48:20,898

00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,037
They're gonna
 kill me with trash.
 Not if you don't let them.

1021
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:15,973
It's my own fault.
 It's my own goddamned fault.
 I didn't keep it together.

1022
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,879
We can still win this thing.
 We're going to win it.

1023
00:56:21,912 --> 00:56:23,948
But the hits you're taking are
 nothing compared to what

1024
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:26,617
average folks
 are going through.

1025
00:56:26,651 --> 00:56:29,754
Hmm.
Losing their jobs,
losing their homes.

1026
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:33,791
Keep that in your mind.
 Keep the folks in your mind.
 Yes.

1027
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:37,962
It's about them, isn't it?
 Yeah, it's about them.
 It's about history.

1028
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:41,932
Well, that's truer
 for Susan than it is for me.
 It's always been about them.

1029
00:56:41,966 --> 00:56:47,538
Like this fella, Danny
 Scanlon. Worked every day
 since he was 14.

1030
00:56:47,572 --> 00:56:50,775
Couldn't get insurance,
 couldn't get his
 leg fixed right.

1031
00:56:50,808 --> 00:56:52,977
Doesn't complain.

1032
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:55,746
Doesn't do anyone any harm.
 Achin' to do good.

1033
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:00,451
[ Sighing ]
 God, if you--

1034
00:57:00,485 --> 00:57:02,520
If you let a man
 like that go down,

1035
00:57:02,553 --> 00:57:05,523
you don't deserve to take up
 space on this planet, do you?

1036
00:57:05,556 --> 00:57:07,024
We won't let him
 go down.
 No.

1037
00:57:19,203 --> 00:57:22,540
[ Ringing ]
 [ Henry Gasps ]
 Sh--

1038
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:28,045
Yeah.
 [ Libby ]
 Bummer, Henry, bummer.

1039
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:31,081
Libby?
Yeah. She's
got tapes.

1040
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:33,117
Who?
 Who's got tapes?

1041
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,219
Cashmere, the hair slut,
 you moron.

1042
00:57:35,252 --> 00:57:37,221
She's gonna play 'em at
 her press conference tomorrow.

1043
00:57:37,254 --> 00:57:39,690
I do not have time
 for ineptitude.

1044
00:57:39,724 --> 00:57:42,059
Now go tell Jack and Susan
 the cunt's got tapes...

1045
00:57:42,092 --> 00:57:45,563
and get your ass
 back to Mammoth Falls.

1046
00:57:45,596 --> 00:57:48,032
[ Dial Tone ]
 [ Sighing ]

1047
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:04,081
Hey, Henry.
 Morning.

1048
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:06,984
Honey, I have to run.
 I will. Hold on.

1049
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:10,087
[ Susan ]
 The new member of the swimming
 team wants to talk to you.

1050
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:14,258
Hey, Jackie boy.
 That's great. You made it.

1051
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:17,828
Well, that's great.
 We're proud of you.

1052
00:58:17,862 --> 00:58:21,031
Yeah. No, no, just a
 bunch of campaign
 garbage, that's all.

1053
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:23,233
Governor, this--
 this can't wait.

1054
00:58:23,267 --> 00:58:27,171
All right.
 Well, we'll call you tonight.
 I love you too. Bye-bye.

1055
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:30,641
- What is it?
 - I was just talking to Libby.

1056
00:58:30,675 --> 00:58:32,677
She says Cashmere McLeod
 has tape recordings
 of you and her...

1057
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,912
talking on the
 phone together...

1058
00:58:34,945 --> 00:58:36,981
and she's gonna
 play them at a press
 conference tomorrow.

1059
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:44,622
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
 How bad?

1060
00:58:44,655 --> 00:58:47,658
I don't know.
 Did you tell her-- Henry,
 could you excuse us, please?

1061
00:58:47,692 --> 00:58:50,027
Sure.

1062
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:59,904
Well, it is cold here, Sam,
 but these are friendly people.

1063
00:58:59,937 --> 00:59:02,907
- It reminds me a lot of home.
 - I like her hair that way.

1064
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:07,244
It softens her face.
 Yes. Could be
 longer, though.

1065
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:09,747
If you hung out
 with us for a day,

1066
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:13,083
you'd see what the folks
 are really interested in
 is the future.

1067
00:59:13,117 --> 00:59:16,787
- He's gotten fat.
 - [ Man ] And he jogs. Can you
 imagine how much he eats?

1068
00:59:16,821 --> 00:59:20,825
- Can you imagine
 what he eats?
 - What's he governor of again?

1069
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:23,193
Let me see. It's not Georgia.
 [ Announcer ] Governor, just
 to set the record straight,

1070
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:25,930
did you have an affair
 with Cashmere McLeod?
 Not Florida.

1071
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:29,333
Now, Sam, I am not gonna
 dignify that trash.

1072
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:32,202
And I am disappointed,
 at a time when the
 American people...

1073
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:34,304
have an awful lot
 they're concerned about--

1074
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:37,942
I saw a picture
 of the hairdresser.
 Not bad.

1075
00:59:37,975 --> 00:59:39,877
We've had tough times
 in our marriage, but
 we've worked them out.

1076
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:43,247
I don't think
 this is fair.

1077
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,917
People suffer and struggle
 and go through all sorts
 of crazy things.

1078
00:59:46,951 --> 00:59:49,954
The important thing is
 we're still here.

1079
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:53,924
If you want to draw
 a political lesson from that
 about Jack's character,

1080
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:56,193
here it is:
 He will stick.

1081
00:59:56,226 --> 00:59:59,029
He will work
 through the tough times.

1082
00:59:59,063 --> 01:00:02,867
He will wake up every morning
 and bust his butt
 for the American people.

1083
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,702
"Bust his butt."
 The mouth on her.

1084
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:07,638
He should just take
her in hand.

1085
01:00:07,672 --> 01:00:10,240
Yeah, right.
 Yeah, but she's honest.
 They had some tough times.

1086
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:13,410
Maybe that's when
he screwed the hairdresser.
 [ Phone Ringing ]

1087
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:18,315
[ Announcer ] And with that
 we come to the end of
 The Week In Washington.

1088
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:20,284

 thank you for joining us.

- Hi. Are you watching?
 - [ Stantons ] Thank you.

- Yeah, it's just
 going off now.

- [ Man On P.A. ] We're out.
 Thanks, everybody.

And it's over.
 How'd it play where you are?

1093
01:00:31,796 --> 01:00:33,998
Wasn't she fantastic?

1094
01:00:34,031 --> 01:00:37,902
Yeah, great. But they'd
 like to see her hair
 a little longer.

1095
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:41,906

 Not long.

 get to Sailor's and watch
 old Cashmere with an expert.

 public the tapes which she
 says prove her allegations...

 against Governor Jack Stanton.

I want to make
 one thing clear.

We'll take no questions
 until after the playing
 of the tapes.

And this will not
 be an inquisition.

Yeah, right.
We get the inquisition.

1130

The tapes were recorded on
 Miss McLeod's phone machine.

Portions you're about
 to hear were recorded

You said no one could do
 the things I did to you.

[ Cashmere ]
 I could come up there.
 God, what a whiny bitch!

 Stay home, crack open

 possible to get laid?

1145

[ Cashmere ] I'd say it's
 entirely possible, if you
 postpone that trip.

[ Jack ]
 I'm too horny
 to think straight.

As you can see, these tapes
 were, uh, recorded on
 Miss McLeod's phone machine--

1148
01:03:43,353 --> 01:03:46,190
All right, I'm recording

 I'm gonna kill him. How could
 he be so fuckin' dumb?

 of abrupt cutouts in here.

 What you doin'
 this weekend?

 in midsentence, I think.

 Stay home, crack open
 a bottle of Chablis.

 possible to get laid?

[ Sailorman ]
 Now, that breakup
 in the middle,

1158

that could be cellular static,
 or they might have

Wait a second.
 Wait a goddamned second.

1160
01:04:15,953 --> 01:04:17,521

 Do you think it's at all
 possible to get laid?

1162

[ Mumbling ]
 "At all possible
 to get laid." Again.

 - Just again, damn it.

1164

 Do you think it's at all

 Yourself!

Hello? You're not crackin' up,
 are you, 'cause two of us
 would be one too many.

1167

Un-fucking-believable!

He said, "Do you think it's at
 all possible to get yourself
 laid?" He was talking to me.

1169
01:04:50,287 --> 01:04:52,122
He said he didn't want me
 too horny to think straight.

1170
01:04:52,156 --> 01:04:54,624
It was just before
 Thanksgiving.

1171
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:58,562
Okay, look.
 Play it again from the top.
 Just his lines. One at a time.

 [ Jack ] I'm on my way
 to meet with the family.

There was an accident, uh,
a bender on the interstate.

1174
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:09,239
That's the family he was gonna
 meet. Okay, next line, his.

 - An abrupt cutout, right?

1176
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:17,281
- Yep.
 - He said, "What are you doin'
 this weekend, Henry ?"

1177
01:05:17,314 --> 01:05:22,019
I remember he called me Henry.
 I remember the whole call,
 it meant so much to me.

1178
01:05:22,052 --> 01:05:24,221
Ha! Jesus Christ!
 We got her!

1179
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:27,591
You got her. We don't.
 How do we prove it?

1180
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:33,163
Ah, no, no.
 No. Libby, they--

1181

We can't let 'em
get away with this.

1182

Come on. This cannot be
a world that lets them
get away with it!

1183

Oh, my. Imagine a black boy
 sayin' that. What a privileged
 fuckin' life you've had.

1184
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:44,674
But never mind
 about the world, baby.

1185
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:48,245
I won't let 'em get away
 with it. I will find a way.

1186
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:51,181
I'm gonna get a lead on where
 Ted Koppel and Larry King
 are this weekend.

1187
01:05:51,215 --> 01:05:53,650
Can you nail the conversations
 on their cellulars?

1188
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:56,286
Have to rent a van,
 track 'em. Sure.
 Do it.

1189
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:59,389
Then we'll pick the best one.
 Let's go, Henry.

[ Libby ]
 You asshole!

1193
01:06:06,263 --> 01:06:10,600
Yes, it was off a cellular
 telephone, but don't pull that
 outraged-puppy shit with me.

1194
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:13,603
It's not like you've
suddenly become an innocent
because the tape is phony.

1195
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:16,640
God! I wish we'd castrated you
 when we had the chance.

Libby, you're talking
 on a cellular phone!
 Oh, shit!

Yes, I-- Goddamned
sure I know who did it.

Yes.

 Okay. Bye.

 You know who did it?

Yes. Oh, yes, indeedy.

- What the--
 - Triumphant day, huh, Randy?

1203

Perhaps your best day.

Is that Cashmere on the line?
 Let me say hi.
 No, it's not.

1205

Say good-bye
 to Sherman Presley, then.
 We've got business.

1206

It's not Sherman Presley,
 whoever he is.

 what you're talking about.

 friend the governor's private

What? Are you--
 Come on, why would I do that?

 exhausted my patience.

 a signed confession.

 before you do something stupid
 and get yourself into trouble!

Randy, you wet fart
of a human turd,

1217
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,803
you ambushed Jack Stanton,
 and you're gonna admit it
 or you're gonna die.

 anything about this.

write this out in longhand?

You couldn't just make do

 did. You had to embellish it.

 You have a choice to make,
 and very quickly.

and guilt-ridden
 about your jealousy and greed.

You could not live with
 yourself if you deprived the
 American people of this man.

Tonight an aide
of Governor Jack Stanton...

has asked to join us
 in order to play a tape.

1242

I haven't heard this tape yet,
 but my producer has.

1243
01:08:40,884 --> 01:08:44,221
We'd like to thank her
for letting us go on
with such short notice.

 No, no, no. I can't wait.
 I have to have it now, okay?

 Look at his face.
Oh, my God.

1250
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:05,275
- Now, that sounded like me.
 - It was you, Larry,

1251
01:09:05,309 --> 01:09:08,612
asking the headwaiter at
 Cafe des Artistes could he
 seat you right away...

1252
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:11,381

 anything to eat
 since morning.

 - We recorded it off

1254
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:17,321
[ Daisy ]
 Now I would like to read
 a letter from the man...

1255
01:09:17,354 --> 01:09:20,224
who did the same thing
 to Governor Stanton.

 of unsubstantiated garbage--

01:11:20,377 --> 01:11:23,547
It all started
 innocently enough
 for Governor Stanton.

He walked in one day and he

No. It would ruin

01:19:53,923 --> 01:19:57,593
I do not agree with
 Senator Harris's proposal
 to study a reduction,

1440
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:01,898
even a freeze,
 in cost-of-living adjustments
 for Social Security.

1441
01:20:01,931 --> 01:20:05,835
And I also disagree
 with Senator Harris
 about Medicare.

1442

[ Audience Murmuring ]

1443
01:20:08,337 --> 01:20:11,975
There's one other area where
 Senator Harris and I disagree,
 and that is the Middle East.

1444
01:20:12,008 --> 01:20:13,843
[ Audience
 Continues Murmuring ]

1445
01:20:13,877 --> 01:20:16,279
When he was a member
 of the Senate Foreign
 Relations Committee,

1446
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:21,317
my opponent cast many votes
 regarding the security and
 future of the state of Israel.

1447
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:25,588
- [ Woman ] No!
 - Wait, I agree with many
 of his votes, but some--

1448
01:20:25,621 --> 01:20:28,291
Well, I think it's important
 to stand with our friends.

1449
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:31,861
And America has
 no better friend than
 the state of Israel.

1450
01:20:31,895 --> 01:20:35,164
- [ Approving Murmurs ]
 - Thank you.

1451
01:20:41,037 --> 01:20:44,173
Well, we're up three points
 and climbing-- Thanks, God--

1452
01:20:44,207 --> 01:20:46,242
so a meeting with the Rainbow
 Coalition might just be--
 [ Knocking At Door ]

1453
01:20:46,275 --> 01:20:50,947
Uh, one second.
 Who is it?
 William McCollister.

1454
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:54,183
Can I call you back?
 Yeah, I'll just be
 five minutes.

1455
01:20:58,321 --> 01:21:00,623
Ain't you rememberin' me,
 Mr. Burton?

1456
01:21:00,656 --> 01:21:03,426
Willie.
 The barbecue place.
 Come on in.

1457
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:08,631
So, uh, what are you
 doing here?

1458
01:21:08,664 --> 01:21:13,469
Well, I figured it'd be easier
 to talk face-to-face
 with a brother...

1459
01:21:13,502 --> 01:21:16,505
than to the gov, even though
 he's like a brother.

1460
01:21:16,539 --> 01:21:19,375
I, uh--

1461
01:21:19,408 --> 01:21:23,012
I flew here 'cause my daughter
 Loretta is with child,

1462
01:21:23,046 --> 01:21:26,215
and she says Governor
 Jack Stanton's the daddy.

1463
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:31,454
Right.

1464
01:21:35,658 --> 01:21:39,395
Has he landed yet?
 Yeah. He's
 in the men's room.

1465
01:21:39,428 --> 01:21:43,132
Okay.
 Uh, is he alone?
 What do you mean?

1466
01:21:43,166 --> 01:21:45,068
Doesn't matter.

1467
01:21:49,038 --> 01:21:52,441
Governor.
 Hey. Well, we're
 in the lead.

1468
01:21:52,475 --> 01:21:56,679
Uh, good, good.
 Senator Harris is second. The
 undecided's killin' everyone.

1469
01:21:56,712 --> 01:21:59,949
Governor, Willie McCollister
 came to see me last night.

1470
01:21:59,983 --> 01:22:02,518
His daughter is pregnant and
 she says you're the father.

1471
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:14,163
Who else knows?
 Well, he says no one.

1472
01:22:14,197 --> 01:22:16,199
What's he want?
 I don't know.

1473
01:22:19,202 --> 01:22:21,070
I just can't catch
 a break, can I?

1474
01:22:23,339 --> 01:22:26,675
All right. All right.
 Is Willie still here?

1475
01:22:26,709 --> 01:22:28,544
Uh, no, he went back
 early this morning.

1476
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:31,447
Well, I can't leave
before the primary.

1477
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,749
If this gets out,
 it'll kill us.

1478
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:37,186
You and Howard'll
have to fly back to
Mammoth Falls tomorrow.

1479
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:39,188
We gotta talk to him.

1480
01:22:39,222 --> 01:22:42,125
We gotta make sure he
 understands there's been
 some kind of mistake.

1481
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:46,095
They're good people
but not sophisticated.
But I want 'em to know.

1482
01:22:46,129 --> 01:22:48,464
Why pick me?

1483
01:22:48,497 --> 01:22:51,400
Is it because
 I'm black?
 No.

1484
01:22:51,434 --> 01:22:54,237
It's because
 Willie picked you.

1485
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:57,440
You don't have to say
 anything. Howard knows
 exactly what to say.

1486
01:22:57,473 --> 01:23:01,210
But you should be there
because he came to you.
 All right.

1487
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:03,346
Governor,
 if I'm gonna do this,

1488
01:23:03,379 --> 01:23:05,381
then there's something
 I need to know.

1489
01:23:05,414 --> 01:23:09,085
I am not the father
of that child.

1490
01:23:09,118 --> 01:23:14,190
Henry, you will never
 have to be ashamed
 to be part of this campaign.

1491
01:23:14,223 --> 01:23:17,760
You understand that?
 You never have to swallow it,
 duck it or apologize for it.

1492
01:23:17,793 --> 01:23:20,163
I'll make sure
 that doesn't happen.

1493
01:23:20,196 --> 01:23:24,400
Guys? Hmm?
 [ Sighs ]

[ Dog Barking ]

1495
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:42,185
Hey, Mr. Burton.
 Hi, Willie.

1496
01:23:43,252 --> 01:23:45,221
Hey, Gov.

1497
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:50,359
You remember Howard Ferguson.
 He works with the
 governor too.

1498
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:57,433
Hello.
 Mornin'.

1499
01:23:57,466 --> 01:24:01,370
Well, what can I
 do for ya?

1500
01:24:03,406 --> 01:24:05,441
The governor
 is very concerned...

1501
01:24:05,474 --> 01:24:08,677
about this situation
 with your daughter.

1502
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:10,446
He'd like
 to see it resolved.

1503
01:24:12,681 --> 01:24:15,651
As I'm sure you would.

1504
01:24:15,684 --> 01:24:18,721
He would like her
 to have an amniocentesis
 as soon as possible...

1505
01:24:18,754 --> 01:24:21,857
so that paternity can be
 positively established.

1506
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:27,563
A what?
 It's a medical procedure
 performed in a hospital.

1507
01:24:27,596 --> 01:24:29,732
A needle is inserted
 into the abdomen.

1508
01:24:29,765 --> 01:24:33,102
Amniotic fluid is drawn
 from your daughter's womb.

1509
01:24:33,136 --> 01:24:36,172
Genetic material is analyzed.
 It can then be compared...

1510
01:24:36,205 --> 01:24:38,174
with the governor's blood
 to determine whether
 he is the father.

1511
01:24:38,207 --> 01:24:40,476
I don't understand.
 It's normally used to
 determine...

1512
01:24:40,509 --> 01:24:44,447
the health of the fetus,
 and that's what you'll
 tell them at Mercy Hospital.

1513
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:48,551
That you want to make sure
 that the baby's healthy.

1514
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,186
It's a common
 procedure, Willie.

1515
01:24:50,219 --> 01:24:51,520
They put a needle
in her belly?

1516
01:24:51,554 --> 01:24:54,190
Look, look, look.
 Mr. McCollister.

1517
01:24:54,223 --> 01:24:56,692
There are people
 who would like to destroy
 Governor Stanton.

1518
01:24:56,725 --> 01:24:59,328
He doesn't believe
 you're one of them,
 but he can't allow this.

1519
01:24:59,362 --> 01:25:01,697
You can't allow this.

1520
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:05,468
I'm sure your daughter's
 a fine young person,
 but she's a child.

1521
01:25:05,501 --> 01:25:08,471
Children are impressionable,
 and there's been a lot of news
 about the governor--

1522
01:25:08,504 --> 01:25:11,907
She ain't said a word
 to anybody. I told her not to.
 She's a good girl.

1523
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:15,611
Oh, I'm sure she is.

1524
01:25:15,644 --> 01:25:17,346
And the governor wants to do
 everything possible

1525
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:19,882
to help her, and you,
 through this time.

1526
01:25:19,915 --> 01:25:22,285
He is prepared to be
 very generous.

1527
01:25:22,318 --> 01:25:25,321
He will help her
 provide for the baby.

1528
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:30,393
Now, he'll do this
 because he believes that
 you are his friend.

1529
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:36,499
But we must resolve this.

1530
01:25:36,532 --> 01:25:38,834
We must determine to
everyone's satisfaction

1531
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:40,769
that he is not the
 father of that child.

1532
01:25:44,273 --> 01:25:45,708
I'm sure that
 you, uh--

1533
01:25:47,843 --> 01:25:49,645
you know,
 you understand...

1534
01:25:51,414 --> 01:25:52,815
our position.

1535
01:26:00,356 --> 01:26:02,658
Pull over.

1536
01:26:02,691 --> 01:26:04,527
Pull over.

1537
01:26:23,746 --> 01:26:27,683
Hello, folks. I'm Izzy
 Rosenblatt, and I'm here
 with Schmooze for Jews.

1538
01:26:27,716 --> 01:26:30,819
And my guest today is
presidential nominee...

1539
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:33,489
and J.F.K. look-alike,
 Governor Jack Stanton.

1540
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:35,090
Hi, Izzy.
 Hi, Jack.

1541
01:26:35,123 --> 01:26:39,895
Jack, when we were talking
before, you were telling me
that your mama liked Vegas.

1542
01:26:39,928 --> 01:26:42,998
As a tip to our listeners,
 when she goes there,
 where does she stay?

1543
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:45,734
Which hotel?
 Well, she's pretty loyal
 to the MGM Grand.

1544
01:26:45,768 --> 01:26:48,837
MGM Grand. Listen up,
 you Vegas fans.

1545
01:26:48,871 --> 01:26:52,341
And, and who is
her favorite act there?
Is it Wayne Newton?

1546
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:55,978
Absolutely.
 Everybody loves Wayne Newton.
 He's marvelous.

1547
01:26:56,011 --> 01:26:59,848
He was once a guest
 on this show. That was
 many, many years ago.

1548
01:26:59,882 --> 01:27:04,420
Now, to satisfy the curiosity
 of our Vegas fans,

1549
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:07,523
when your mother
 plays blackjack,
 where does she stand pat?

1550
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:10,893
Is it 16?
 Well, she is a bit
 of a gambler.

1551
01:27:10,926 --> 01:27:14,597
Uh, but sometimes
 she'll go up to 17.
Oh, my.

1552
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:18,967
Uh, excuse me, Governor,
 but I'm told we have
 Senator Harris on the phone.

1553
01:27:19,001 --> 01:27:22,705
Uh, hello.
 This is indeed an honor.
 Thank you.

1554
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:26,609
We were just talking with
 Governor Stanton about how
 his mother loves Las Vegas.

1555
01:27:26,642 --> 01:27:30,479
I was wondering, Senator,
 does your mother have
 a favorite vacation spot?

1556
01:27:30,513 --> 01:27:35,484
My mother's dead.
 Oh.
 I'm sorry.

1557
01:27:35,518 --> 01:27:39,688
Jack Stanton should be ashamed
 of the way he's scaring other
 elderly people down here.

1558
01:27:39,722 --> 01:27:42,625
You mean about
going up to 17?
 What?

1559
01:27:42,658 --> 01:27:44,727
I'm not following you.

1560
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,363
He's telling people I'm
 going to cut their
 Social Security and--

1561
01:27:47,396 --> 01:27:50,433
It's, uh-- Come on, Larry.
 It's part of your book.

1562
01:27:50,466 --> 01:27:53,035
Everyone knows what you're
 doing down here, the sleazy
 politics you're playing!

1563
01:27:53,068 --> 01:27:56,405
Is it okay if I
 get a word in here?
 Go ahead. Be my guest.

1564
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:58,941
What am I saying?
 You are my guest!
 [ Chuckling ]

1565
01:27:58,974 --> 01:28:04,547
Larry, I'm lookin'
 at your campaign book here.
 Page 18, paragraph 3.

1566
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:08,984
What does it mean when you
 say you want to study a freeze
 of cost-of-living adjustments?

1567
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:11,520
Ah. That's only
 one possibility.

1568
01:28:11,554 --> 01:28:14,790
Uh, we might want to rework
 how they're calculated.

1569
01:28:14,823 --> 01:28:18,927
I can tell you, cost-of-living
 adjustments are calculated
 to keep up with inflation.

1570
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:21,430
But I guess you don't think
 that's such a good idea.

1571
01:28:21,464 --> 01:28:24,333
Now, wait a minute!
 I didn't say that.
 It's right here in your book.

1572
01:28:24,367 --> 01:28:26,935
I-I said it has to be studied.
 Who knows?

1573
01:28:26,969 --> 01:28:30,706
We might even want to spend
 more on cost-of-living
 adjustments.

1574
01:28:30,739 --> 01:28:34,877
Tell me, Senator, who is
 your favorite comedian?
 What?

1575
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:37,413
I'm tellin' the folks
 what my positions are.

1576
01:28:37,446 --> 01:28:39,815
And you're the one here that--
 No, no, no. You're
 distorting my positions.

1577
01:28:39,848 --> 01:28:42,451
This is the reason no one
 trusts the political process!

1578
01:28:42,485 --> 01:28:44,953
You just can't defend
 your positions.
 Not when you play these games.

01:36:33,321 --> 01:36:38,160
You see, what happened was I
 got too wrapped up in the
 business of being governor...

1719
01:36:38,193 --> 01:36:40,528
and I began
 to neglect my family,

1720
01:36:40,562 --> 01:36:44,867
and my wife fell in love
 with another man.

1721
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:48,837
I quit in part to see if
 I could salvage my marriage,
 but I couldn't.

1722
01:36:48,871 --> 01:36:51,106
So I just wanted to make sure
 that my boys...

1723
01:36:51,139 --> 01:36:54,042
knew that they had two parents
 that loved them very much.

1724
01:36:54,076 --> 01:36:58,446
And I think if you ask them
they'll tell you that
we made it through okay.

1725
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:02,384
They're in college now,
 and when Mrs. Harris
 asked me to do this,

1726
01:37:02,417 --> 01:37:05,020
they were very, very
 enthusiastic.

 that I'm doing this
 for them too.

I wanna talk
 about Picker,

1874
01:46:08,062 --> 01:46:11,533
something Richard said
 about Picker.

1875

I wanna find out...

1876
01:46:13,768 --> 01:46:16,971
why did Picker quit
 in '78?

1877
01:46:21,976 --> 01:46:25,613
[ Libby ]
 The only dirt I ever heard
 about Picker...

1878
01:46:25,647 --> 01:46:28,049
was a condo development
 named Clearwater Estates...

1879
01:46:28,082 --> 01:46:31,486
where the state matched money
 for the county to build
 a connecting road.

1880
01:46:31,519 --> 01:46:33,655
And?

1881
01:46:33,688 --> 01:46:36,491
Nothing specific.

1882
01:46:36,524 --> 01:46:40,462
The project was being
 developed by a guy
 named Edgardo Reyes.

1883
01:46:40,495 --> 01:46:43,665
Edgardo Reyes is the brother
 of Antonia Reyes, who is--

1884
01:46:43,698 --> 01:46:47,769
Picker's former wife.
 Who else knows about this?

1885
01:46:47,802 --> 01:46:50,472
Anyone follow it up?
 Nope.

1886
01:46:50,505 --> 01:46:53,641
Well, Lib, let's go.

1887

1888
01:47:00,014 --> 01:47:03,818
What?
 I'm tryin' to decide.

1889
01:47:03,851 --> 01:47:08,089
- Decide what?
 - Whether I wanna do this
 for ya, you stupid shit.

1890

All the difference in the
 world. All the moral
 difference in the world.

I'm not too
 interested in tearin' ol'
 Freddy Picker down.

1894
01:47:21,836 --> 01:47:25,940
And if he's bent,
 if he's a crook?
 It'll out.

1895
01:47:25,973 --> 01:47:29,076
But when?
 Say he wins the nomination,
 and then it comes out.

 But it won't.

 It won't matter that my blood
 doesn't match Loretta's baby.

It won't matter
 that I can't be the father.

1902
01:47:50,698 --> 01:47:52,834
The only way it would matter
 is if I were the father,

1903
01:47:52,867 --> 01:47:55,269
because guilty is
what's interesting.

1904

Am I supposed to live
 by these rules and let Picker
 slide in on a special pass...

1905
01:47:58,606 --> 01:48:01,676
because you were a Picker
 person in the '70s?

1906

You mean "and justice
 for all"? That's a
 stupid fuckin' argument.

1907
01:48:04,646 --> 01:48:08,950
Okay, but this isn't.
 Picker could be guilty
 of fraud or a tax swindle.

1908

If he used influence
 to help his brother-in-law,
 he's not fit to be president.

01:54:23,390 --> 01:54:25,960
Actually, of us and them
 and us again.

2006
01:54:25,993 --> 01:54:28,362
We passed the entrance exam.
 We got the dirt.

2007

Now it's about them,
 Jack and Susan.

2008

What are they
 gonna do with it?

2009
01:54:32,666 --> 01:54:36,503
Little buddy, isn't that
what we're both after here?

2010
01:54:36,537 --> 01:54:39,440
I mean, after 25 years, I get
 to see what they're about.

2011
01:54:40,674 --> 01:54:43,110
Not just hypothesize.
 Not just hope.

2012

This is it.
Graduation day.

2013

They graduate or I do.

2014
01:54:49,716 --> 01:54:54,121
Tell the truth, Henry.
 Isn't that what you're
 really after too?

2015
01:54:54,155 --> 01:54:56,123
[ Horn Honking ]
 Watch the road, Libby,
 goddamn it.

2016

[ Libby ]
 Isn't it?

2017
01:55:16,077 --> 01:55:18,512
[ Libby ] Here, Governor,
 feast your eyes.
 You too, my lady.

2018
01:55:18,545 --> 01:55:20,314
Henry, a transcript
 of our tour.

[ Water Running ]

2020
01:55:35,029 --> 01:55:37,331

 This is remarkable.

[ Groans ]

2022
01:55:41,502 --> 01:55:44,405
How on earth did he

get away with this?

Now, now, what do we do
with this?

2025
01:55:53,047 --> 01:55:57,318
The Times?
 No, the Wall Street Journal.
 More authoritative in a way.

2026

Through an intermediary,
 someone not associated
 with the campaign.

 - I don't think there's
 anything of use here.

[ Chuckles ]
 You gotta be kiddin'.

It doesn't meet
 my standards.

What on earth do you mean?

2032
01:56:19,773 --> 01:56:23,644
I mean, madame, Henry
 and I don't think the use
 of this material is proper.

2033
01:56:23,677 --> 01:56:28,415
We have a moral objection.
 And I have a historical beef.

2034
01:56:28,449 --> 01:56:31,652
Aw, come on, Libby.
 Why did you go out and get it
 if you weren't gonna use it?

2035
01:56:31,685 --> 01:56:34,321
'Cause Susan was right.
 He could've been a real shit.

 he would be, and he isn't.
 But he could've been.

But, Jackie, my dearest,
 you're off the fuckin' point.

2038

The point is we don't do
 this sort of thing.

Oh, I'll be relentless bustin'
 dust and guardin' your ass.

I'd have even blown
 Randy Culligan's weenie off

Well, maybe I wouldn't have.
 But this is something else.

2042

This is hurting someone else.
 This sucks.

You wanna know
 why this sucks?

[ Henry ]
 Yeah, but look at you.
 You little shit.

2049

 to have a waist.

 Hush up.
 Don't ruin it.

2051
01:57:24,605 --> 01:57:28,809
Do you remember when this was?
 You don't, do you?

2052
01:57:28,842 --> 01:57:32,079
The Miami headquarters
 in '72.
 Yeah.

2053
01:57:32,113 --> 01:57:36,550
It was taken just after
 the convention. I'll never
 forget that convention.

2054

Libby, for chrissake,
 what are you doing?
 What's the point?

2055
01:57:39,753 --> 01:57:43,824
The point is Eagleton.
 'Member, Jack?

2056

I must've known you,
 what, two days then?

2057
01:57:47,161 --> 01:57:52,399
We hear that McGovern has
 chosen a vice president who
 had electric shock treatments.

2058
01:57:52,433 --> 01:57:54,568
For the first time I
 considered the possibility...

2059
01:57:54,601 --> 01:57:57,704
we might lose
 to that fuckbrain Nixon.

2060
01:57:57,738 --> 01:58:02,309
I mean, before that,
 I was absolutely convinced
 we would win.

2061
01:58:02,343 --> 01:58:05,646
[ Chuckling ]
 Can you imagine, Henry?
 We were so fuckin' young.

2062
01:58:06,813 --> 01:58:11,152
And this one--
 He takes me out.

2063

We go to this little
 open-air Cuban joint.
 'Member, Jack?

2064
01:58:14,488 --> 01:58:17,624
I got my head in my hands.
 Life has ended.

01:58:17,658 --> 01:58:21,628
I say, "They did it.
 The C.I.A. It had to be
 the C.I.A."

2066
01:58:21,662 --> 01:58:24,398
I couldn't believe that
 Tom Eagleton would really be
 a nutcase.

2067
01:58:24,431 --> 01:58:27,334
They had to have dragged
 him off and drugged him
 and made him crazy.

2068
01:58:27,368 --> 01:58:30,737
It couldn't have been
that McGovern was
a complete fucking amateur.

2069
01:58:30,771 --> 01:58:35,909
No, they did dirty tricks.

 capability as the C.I.A."

 are better."

2076

That was a long time ago.

2077
01:58:59,833 --> 01:59:03,337
Libby, you said it yourself.
 We were young.

2078
01:59:04,605 --> 01:59:06,340
We didn't know
 how the world worked.

2079

Now we know.

2080
01:59:10,811 --> 01:59:14,581
We know that if we don't move
 on this Picker situation,
 two things will happen:

2081
01:59:14,615 --> 01:59:16,850
The first is, we're dead.
 Everything we've worked for...

2082
01:59:16,883 --> 01:59:21,655
since Miami 25 years ago dies,
 and fast.

2083
01:59:21,688 --> 01:59:24,891
The second thing that happens
 is someday very soon,
 when the romance dies,

2084
01:59:24,925 --> 01:59:27,494
when they've gotten sick
 of Freddie Picker's quiet,
 righteous act,

2085
01:59:27,528 --> 01:59:30,464
some enterprising journalist
 will stumble onto this.

2086
01:59:32,499 --> 01:59:35,302
If he doesn't, the Republicans
 will lead him to it
 on their timetable.

2087
01:59:35,336 --> 01:59:38,339
Next fall, it'll be
 another Eagleton.

2088
01:59:38,372 --> 01:59:40,841
It'll be our fault this time
 for letting it happen.

2089
01:59:41,875 --> 01:59:43,410
Your fault, Libby.

2090

Honey, you may be right.

2091
01:59:46,813 --> 01:59:49,683
All of it may be right.

2092
01:59:49,716 --> 01:59:53,420
But we can't do it
 because it just ain't
 who we're supposed to be.

2093
01:59:53,454 --> 01:59:56,523
Maybe we could leak part of
 it, the Clearwater stuff.

We know the
 Republicans have that.

 have the rest any day now?

 gonna tell this story once?

I'm sorry, Libby.
 There's just no discussion.

 this dies here.

I'm sorry, sweetheart,
 but it does.

Test results on Jack's blood,
 Uncle Charlie's blood taken
 over the years.

 Jack gave me that proves
 he's not the father...

 It's not your blood.
 Isn't that a riot?

The blood sample
 Dr. Beauregard took
 was not from you.

It was
 from Uncle Charlie.

2110

You sent him to have his blood
 tested in your place,

2111
02:00:52,813 --> 02:00:55,382
because you know
 good old Dr. Beauregard
 loves you and...

 "wants to teach those Yankees
 a lesson."

He's not gonna love you enough
 to lose his license, Jack.

2114
02:01:00,787 --> 02:01:04,425
Once he knows
 I have proof, he'll fold
 like a cheap accordion.

2115
02:01:04,458 --> 02:01:07,528
I know that won't prove
 you are the father
 of Loretta's baby.

2116
02:01:07,561 --> 02:01:09,396
In fact,
 I think you're not.

2117

But it proves you thought
 you might be.

That proves you fucked her.
 That will kill your chances.

You would end
 his political career.

You see, Jack,
 she hasn't even heard.

2122
02:01:27,714 --> 02:01:32,052
She isn't even upset
 that you fucked your
 17-year-old baby-sitter.

2123

 It's never the cheat
 who goes to hell.

It's always the one
 who he cheated on.

 in that voice from hell
 about your political career.

 calls you on ever.

Because you're so completely
 fucking special.

2131

 Because everyone was always
 so proud of you.

 a whole lot easier for me.

 a flawed but decent man,

You're giving them
 the blood test info,

Why not?
 Picker will go down anyway.
 We can't save him.

2154
02:03:41,582 --> 02:03:44,851
The whole point of this was
 to see if they'd turn him in,
 and they will.

The Stantons are my sun.

 A lot of us here today grew up
 with Libby Holden.

She was our friend.

She was our big sister.

She bullied us.
 She drove us crazy.

Worst of all, she remembered
 everything about us.

Everything we hoped to be.

Everything we wanted
 the world to be.

Before she died,

 that I disappointed her.

 to do better.

Abraham Lincoln was a whore
before he was a president?

He had to tell his stories
 and smile his shit-eating,
 back-country grin.

2286
02:12:42,188 --> 02:12:45,358
He did it so he would one day
 have the opportunity...

to stand in front of the
 nation and appeal to "the
 better angels of our nature."

2288

That's where
the bullshit stops.
That's what it's all about.

02:13:22,528 --> 02:13:26,299
I wanna work
 for something small.
 Voter registration.

2298
02:13:26,332 --> 02:13:29,169
After everyone's registered,
 who will they vote for?

2299
02:13:29,202 --> 02:13:31,637
In the end, Henry,
 who can do this
 better than me?

2300
02:13:31,671 --> 02:13:33,406
Think about it.
 Is there anyone out there...

2301
02:13:33,439 --> 02:13:37,777
with a chance to actually win
 this election who'd do more
 for the people than I would?

2302
02:13:37,810 --> 02:13:39,512
Who'd even think
 about the folks
 I care about?

 Oh, shit.
 Aw, is that them? So quick?

- [ Henry ]
 That damn driver. I knew it.
 - All right.

2305
02:13:49,155 --> 02:13:52,092
We'll go talk
 to them together.
 Come on.

2306
02:13:52,125 --> 02:13:57,130
Ah, don't shake your head.
 We worked so hard together
 to get here.

2307
02:13:57,163 --> 02:13:59,332
It's there for us now.
 Right there.

2308
02:14:00,366 --> 02:14:02,168
We can do incredible things.

2309
02:14:03,236 --> 02:14:05,238
We can change
this whole country.

2310
02:14:08,174 --> 02:14:12,678
I'm gonna win this thing,
 and when I do,
 we're gonna make history.

2311
02:14:12,712 --> 02:14:16,149
Look me in the eye and tell me
 it's not gonna happen.

2312
02:14:16,182 --> 02:14:19,419
Look me in the eye and tell me
 you don't wanna be part of it.

2313
02:14:21,854 --> 02:14:26,259
Jeez-- Jesus, Henry.
You want me to get down
on my knees?

2314
02:14:26,292 --> 02:14:29,362
I can't do without you.
Don't leave me now.

2315
02:14:32,565 --> 02:14:36,436
You're still with me,
 aren't you? Say you are.
 Say it. Say it.

2316
02:14:39,339 --> 02:14:41,607
Come on. Henry!

2317
02:14:41,641 --> 02:14:44,544
This is ridiculous!
 You gotta be with me!
