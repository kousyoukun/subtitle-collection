1
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,355
You know, I've seen him
do it a million times now,

2
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,159
but I can't tell you
how he does it, Henry.

3
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,834
The right-handed part.

4
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,953
I can tell you a whole lot about what
he does with his left hand, though.

5
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,354
He's a genius with it.

6
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,074
He might put that left hand
on your elbow

7
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,754
or on your bicep,
like he's doing now.

8
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,917
Very basic move.
He's interested in you.

9
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,520
He's honored to meet you.

10
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,269
If he gets any higher,
if he gets on your shoulder, like that,

11
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,319
it's not as intimate.

12
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,400
It means he'll share a laugh with
you or a secret, a light secret,

13
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,193
not a real one,
but very flattering.

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,279
If he doesn't know you that well and wants
to share something emotional with you,

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,119
he'll lock you
in a two-hander.

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,589
Well, you'll see when he
shakes hands with you, Henry.

17
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,875
Governor.

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,439
Governor Stanton, this is Henry Burton.
Governor.

19
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,750
I met your grandfather
when I was a boy.

20
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,714
I hitchhiked to Washington
to hear him speak.

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,269
He was a great man.
Thank you, sir.

22
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,992
How are you?
Good to see you.

23
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,310
He's really glad you're
coming on board. I can tell.

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,471
I didn't say
I was coming on board.

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,994
Did you tell him
I was coming on board?

26
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,838
No, take it easy.

27
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,480
What is he doing here anyway? He's a
Southern governor nobody's heard of.

28
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,149
Already you're sounding
like a campaign manager.

29
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,392
Howard, I said...
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

30
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,798
If I told you Jack Stanton's here 'cause
he's interested in adult literacy,

31
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,314
you'd tell me
I was full of shit.

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,390
Yes.

33
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,279
Howard Ferguson, Henry Burton,
this is Marianne Walsh,

34
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,954
the very special librarian
who's running these classes.

35
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,198
Thank you, Governor Walsh...
Oh, Governor Stanton. I'm sorry.

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,793
I'm a little nervous.
I'm sorry. Um.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,949
If you'll walk with me,
I'll take you up to the, uh, library.

38
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,031
The walls
are pretty bad,

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,158
but the, uh, the library
is much, um...

40
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,197
Better?
Uh, yes, yes.

41
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,829
We're very proud
of the library.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,197
How long ago did you start up this
reading program? About three years ago.

43
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,000
We have no money.
Uh, very little money.

44
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,357
It's the only reading program like
it in New York, that I know of.

45
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,193
Of course, there may be others,
but I don't... know of them.

46
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,720
Ooh!

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,758
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

48
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,558
Yes. Um...

49
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,759
My name is Ruby. I'm a domestic.
I've been in this class two months.

50
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,117
Jack Mandela Washington.
I'm a handyman. How are you, Jack?

51
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,874
Tawana Carter. I'm a waitress.
Good to meet you, Tawana.

52
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,236
Anthony Ramirez,
freelance carpenter.

53
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,994
Nice to meet you.
Raymond Dominguez. I'm a truck driver.

54
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,357
I just wanted to say,
"Welcome aboard." What? I'm not on board.

55
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,352
I just ca...
Maria Lopez, waitress.

56
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,591
You're kidding too, right? Yeah.

57
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,878
Why don't you tell the governor a
little bit about yourself, Dewayne.

58
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,439
I'm a...
I'm a short order chef.

59
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,831
And, uh, until I come here,
I couldn't read a lick.

60
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,399
Dewayne's dyslexic.

61
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,080
And, uh, they just kept
a-passin' me up...

62
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,794
third grade,
fourth grade.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,358
Uh, I just sit in the back
and stickin' to my own self.

64
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,592
And, uh, it was like
no one noticed.

65
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,391
I go on all the ways through and,
uh, I graduated elementary school.

66
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,552
And, uh, they sent me
to Ben Franklin.

67
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,149
That's general studies.

68
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,199
They could've sent me
to the Bronx Zoo.

69
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,069
I mean, no one ever say,
"Dewayne, you can't read.

70
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,154
"What you gonna do with
your sorry ass?" Excuse me.

71
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,870
Anyway,
graduation come, and my mama come.

72
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,032
She take the day off from the
laundry where she work at.

73
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,390
So we're there, and, um,

74
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,394
Dr. Dalembretti is calling out
the names on the diplomas,

75
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,200
and, uh, and... and
what each kid done.

76
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,239
You know, like,
"Sharonna Harris, honors.

77
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,631
Tyrone Kirby,
Regents diploma."

78
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,880
And then...

79
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,074
Then he come
to my name,

80
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,199
and, uh, he say
so everyone hear it...

81
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,590
He said,
"Dewayne Smith...

82
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,320
receives certificate...

83
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,672
of attendance."

84
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,957
You could hear people buzzin'.

85
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,270
I mean, a couple
of folks was laughin'.

86
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,909
I gotta go up there
and get this.

87
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,077
I gotta stand up there,

88
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,709
just dyin',

89
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,475
trying not
to look at anyone.

90
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,356
Trying not to look
too stupid, you know?

91
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,280
And Mama's sittin' out front.

92
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,432
She got her hat on.
She got her purse on her lap.

93
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,794
And tears coming down
from behind her glasses...

94
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,715
like someone...
like someone died.

95
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,598
I wanna thank you...

96
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,037
for sharing that
with us, Dewayne.

97
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,192
I want to thank all of you
for having real courage.

98
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,639
My Uncle Charlie...

99
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,476
was a... a war hero,
World War II.

100
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,835
He was sent to Iwo Jima,
where they raised the flag.

101
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,558
He took out four machine-gun nests
of Japs... Japanese soldiers...

102
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,711
who had a squad
of his buddies pinned down.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,118
He had one grenade, his rifle,
his bayonet and his bare hands.

104
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,351
- And he took 'em out.
- Shit.

105
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,994
They gave him the Medal of Honor.
President Truman did.

106
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,471
When he came home to Grace
Junction, they had a parade for him.

107
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,154
The town fathers came to my
parents' house and said to him,

108
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,073
"Charlie, what you got
in mind for yourself now?"

109
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,038
Charlie said
he didn't know.

110
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,875
The mayor said, "Maybe you'd like a full
scholarship to the state university."

111
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,394
The banker said
maybe Charlie didn't want

112
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,630
to go back to school
after all he'd been through.

113
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,032
Maybe he'd like a management
job, a big future at the bank.

114
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,195
The sawmill owner said, "You may not want
to be cooped up in a school or a bank.

115
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,398
Come manage my crew."
You know what?

116
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,637
Damned if Charlie
didn't turn 'em all down.

117
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,634
- What'd he do?
- Nothin'.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,799
He just laid down on his couch
and smoked his Luckies.

119
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,519
You couldn't get him
off that couch.

120
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,799
Was he messed up
in the head from the war?

121
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,395
It was just
that he couldn't read.

122
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,031
He was embarrassed and
didn't want to tell anyone.

123
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,113
He had the courage to win the
Congressional Medal of Honor,

124
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,274
but he didn't have the courage to do what
each and every one of you is doing here.

125
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,637
He didn't have the courage to
admit he needed help and get it.

126
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,390
I understand what you're doing,
appreciate it, and honor your commitment.

127
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,680
People say, "Jack, why do you spend so
much time and effort on adult literacy?"

128
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,911
And I say to them...

129
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,834
I say to them, "Because...

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,469
it gives me a chance
to see courage."

131
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,113
I want to thank you.

132
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,995
I want to thank you for
allowing me to visit here today.

133
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,157
Thank you, Governor.

134
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,712
Let's get him
out of here.

135
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,509
- He likes it.
- Governor Stanton.

136
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,836
I want to thank you
personally for coming.

137
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,794
I will be damned.

138
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,996
Because I'm...
Ooh! Sorry.

139
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,198
Can I help you?
You should have those shoes checked.

140
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,317
If there's anything...

141
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,757
You're gonna go work for him, aren't you?
No, I am not.

142
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,239
I'm gonna meet him
at his suite

143
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,754
in the Sherry-Netherland
so we can talk.

144
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,834
About what?
Probably about going to work for him.

145
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,715
How can you walk out on Adam Larkin
and get into bed with some cracker...

146
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,474
I'm not getting into bed... who
hasn't done piss for blacks in his state?

147
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,915
I could say the same about Adam Larkin.
But he will.

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,879
He has to bide his time.
He's a black congressman.

149
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,873
I don't like Larkin.
I didn't like working for him.

150
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,758
I don't know what
Stanton wants, but...

151
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,830
Well, I do.

152
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,116
Stanton wants to use the grandson
of a civil rights leader,

153
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,033
a black man in politics,
as a vote getter.

154
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,953
That's hilarious. And you tell
me you have no sense of humor.

155
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,390
Put a black man on the team,
really roll in those votes.

156
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,074
That's why there are so many
black men running the country.

157
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,676
If you're so upset about politics,
come work at The Black Advocate.

158
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,558
We're never disillusioned.

159
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,518
Would you hand me
that tie on the headboard?

160
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,193
Get your
own damn tie.

161
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,839
No tie. No suit.

162
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,839
Just leather jacket cool.
All right.

163
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,231
I'll be back in two hours, and then
we can talk about The Black Advocate.

164
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,359
Okay? Aw, come on,
don't be mad. Co...

165
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,275
Okay, be mad, but only for two
hours, and wait up for me.

166
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,197
Oh, my God.
My boy.

167
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,000
Henry Burton,
I am mighty honored.

168
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,913
I'm Arlen Sporken,
the governor's media consultant.

169
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,230
- Hey, Henry.
- Hi.

170
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,511
Nonfat caffeine?
No, thank you.

171
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,752
I am just delighted that
you're on board. No.

172
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,717
Get me one of
those sandwiches.

173
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,519
Only if you pinch my cheek and
call me "sugar." I'll get it.

174
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,036
We're gonna win this thing.
Isn't that right, Arlen? Absolutely.

175
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,952
The big question
is Ozio.

176
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,875
You think he's got the "cagones" to run?
Uh, cojones.

177
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,874
And I don't know Ozio well
enough to judge his cojones.

178
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,715
They're big but they're glass.
Hey, there, Henry.

179
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,951
Governor Stanton,
it's nice to, uh...

180
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,112
You remember Miss Walsh?
I... Oh, I'm sorry.

181
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,635
- You all right, darlin'?
- Uh, thank you.

182
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,870
Thank you.
For this, um,

183
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,600
opportunity to discuss the, um...
The program.

184
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,831
That's a great program.
Don't you think?

185
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,355
- Yes, excellent program.
- Excuse me. If I could just...

186
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,552
Uh, thank you very much. You take up
what we talked about to the board.

187
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,190
Oh, yes, I will.
I'll just see my way out.

188
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,398
Thank you. Uh, good-bye.
Bye-bye, now.

189
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,553
Miss Walsh is on the regional
board of the Teachers Union.

190
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,075
Ah, a teacher
and a librarian.

191
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,639
It's the missus.

192
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,080
Hi, darlin'.

193
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,075
Oh, oh, listen, honey,
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,072
I'm... Well,
we got stuck here.

195
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,039
But great news, honey.
We had real progress with the teachers.

196
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,596
Tonight? Are you sure?
I'm so sorry, honey.

197
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,149
Charlie, did you know we were
supposed to meet with that guy

198
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,914
from the Portsmouth
Democratic Committee?

199
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,912
Well, goddamn it,
Charlie.

200
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,070
Now, honey.

201
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,669
Are you Uncle Charlie,
the Medal of Honor winner?

202
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,515
Well, I'm Uncle Charlie and whatever
else he says. He's the master.

203
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,119
If you just stop popping my
eardrum, I'll leave right now.

204
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,279
No, please, don't...
Susan, don't go.

205
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,432
Susan, just stay...

206
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,671
We'd better go.

207
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,150
All right. Where's the plane?
Teterboro.

208
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,073
Shit. All the way out there?
All right. Let's go.

209
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,232
Arlen, see you in D.C.
Daisy, come with Howard tomorrow.

210
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,119
Henry, Mitch, Charlie,
let's go, let's go.

211
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,591
Go? I just came here to talk to
you about... Talk on the plane.

212
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,956
It's just New Hampshire.
I teach... Sorry.

213
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,111
I teach classes
in the morning.

214
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,152
Call in sick.
The kids won't mind.

215
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,357
I... Do I have time
for a phone call?

216
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,478
Well, when we get there.
Now, if we're gonna talk, let's talk.

217
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,879
Governor?

218
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,399
Hi, hon.

219
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,158
Mmm.

220
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,880
This is Henry Burton.
This is my wife Susan. Hello.

221
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,271
I met you 25 years ago at your
grandfather's in Oak Bluffs.

222
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,193
You were running under the
sprinkler in little wet underpants.

223
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,749
Your grandfather was a great man.
Oh, thank you.

224
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,797
Jack Stanton could also
be a great man,

225
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,396
if he wasn't such a faithless, thoughtless,
disorganized, undisciplined shit.

226
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,313
Honey, why are you making such a
big deal of this? Because it is big.

227
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,711
First impressions count, asshole.
Oh, hello, this is New Hampshire.

228
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,276
These people don't know you. They
probably don't even remember your state.

229
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,909
They're waiting to be swept
off their feet by Orlando Ozio,

230
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,149
who's governor
of a real state.

231
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,231
They came to meet you,
and you didn't show.

232
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,359
I talked to the head of the Portsmouth
Democratic Party about fly-fishing...

233
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,597
for an hour
and 45 minutes.

234
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,354
Do you realize how...

235
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,996
indescribably boring
fly-fishing is?

236
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,552
Do you realize I'm now committed
to doing this... I'm sorry.

237
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,317
This thing with him. I'm going
fly-fishing because of you, asshole!

238
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,155
You can't... It's not funny.
You can't do this to me, Jack.

239
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,639
We've only been
at this a month,

240
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,439
and already you're fucking up
in your old fucked-up way.

241
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,710
The only shot
we have here...

242
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,230
The only shot
is to be perfect.

243
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,914
Barely adequate won't swing it.

244
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,720
No, Jack,
you can't blow off...

245
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,030
Primrose Lane
Jack.

246
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,875
Life's a holiday
on Primrose Lane

247
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,670
When I'm walking down
that Primrose Lane

248
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,719
With you
You're not funny.

249
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,876
I have
got to find a phone.

250
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,633
When we get back
to the apartment.

251
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,918
Honey, this was
so great today,

252
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,838
this readin' program.

253
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,479
You should have seen
the people,

254
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,914
and the teacher was...

255
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,838
Well, she was
just inspirational.

256
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,950
Gimme a break.

257
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,190
Tell me how good the curriculum
was, not the teacher.

258
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,839
We can replicate
a curriculum.

259
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,389
You can't sell a program
without a good teacher.

260
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,391
This is an argument
I always win, Henry.

261
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,517
Was the teacher
that inspirational?

262
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,592
Well, she...

263
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,639
She was a pretty typical school
board bureaucrat, I thought.

264
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,869
Ha.

265
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,916
We got it
on a six-month sublet.

266
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,515
It's better than a hotel.
Cheaper too.

267
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,876
We can keep clothes
and store stuff.

268
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,879
We have privacy.
I don't give a shit about privacy.

269
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,833
I'm here to get known,
and you can't get known in private.

270
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,634
This is more like the end of
a campaign than the beginning.

271
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,838
Goddamn it, Charlie!
No cable?

272
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,559
You gotta be kiddin', man.

273
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,789
You can't run
for the president

274
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,757
of the United-fucking-States
without CNN!

275
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,830
Do you have any bags?

276
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,911
I didn't expect to come.
I'm leaving in the morning.

277
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,753
How about something to eat?
That'd be great.

278
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,673
This is the worst two-bit,
candy-assed, goddamn place I've ever seen!

279
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,239
Hey! Darling.

280
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,633
It's 4:00 in the morning. This is not how
you want to be introduced to the neighbors.

281
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,191
Come on, Henry.
I'll make you some tea.

282
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,711
Yeah, well, I'm out
of here tomorrow morning.

283
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,315
I know we gotta go cheap,
but not this cheap.

284
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,869
Not loser cheap.

285
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,159
- So why did you quit Larkin?
- What?

286
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,118
Why did you stop working for Adam Larkin?
Careful, it's hot.

287
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,512
Thank you.
Well, I just, um...

288
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,710
It's all right. I know you can't talk
about your old boss to your new boss.

289
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,037
I haven't got
a new boss yet.

290
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,791
Larkin's very different
from Jack. Very cool.

291
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,030
Never blinks.
Hmm.

292
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,072
A pro.

293
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,634
Oh.

294
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,155
He would never swallow tea
without testing it.

295
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,153
Aah.

296
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,757
That's the real thing
experience teaches you. Isn't it?

297
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,439
How not to get burned.

298
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,591
Do you think people
ever learn that?

299
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,795
Not the best people.

300
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,639
He, uh... Adam taught me
a lot, but...

301
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,079
it was all the same.

302
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,554
He never surprised me.

303
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,317
Almost no one stepped up and voted
with us because it was right.

304
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,754
They always asked for a lulu.

305
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,510
Lulu?

306
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,479
Uh, yeah. It's New York
for artificial sweeteners.

307
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,280
Anyway, we'd win,
and then we'd be gutted in the Senate.

308
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,794
We'd settle
for their version,

309
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,518
then the White House
would veto,

310
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,711
which we knew
from the start.

311
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,635
Then what? We'd celebrate
our great moral victory.

312
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,234
We forced a veto.

313
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,474
So you dropped out?

314
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,550
Yeah.

315
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,279
So why are you here?

316
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,393
Tell me.

317
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,358
Tell me.

318
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,359
It's 4:00 in the morning.

319
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,073
Let's just tell the truth.

320
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,029
Okay. Well,

321
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,714
I was always curious
about how it would be...

322
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,794
to work with someone
who actually cared about...

323
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,717
I mean,

324
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,520
it couldn't always have been
the way it is now.

325
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,989
It must have been different
when my grandfather was alive.

326
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,309
Hey, you were there.

327
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,550
You had Kennedy. I didn't.

328
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,509
I've never heard a president use
words like "destiny" and "sacrifice"

329
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,830
without thinking,
"Bullshit."

330
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,192
And okay, maybe it was
bullshit with Kennedy too,

331
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,431
but...

332
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,114
but... people believed it.

333
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,596
And... I guess...

334
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,355
that's what I want.

335
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,192
I want to believe it.

336
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,316
I want to be a part
of something that's history.

337
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,237
I bet this is
the longest answer

338
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,630
to a five-word question
you have ever gotten.

339
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,712
No, it isn't.

340
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,713
The longest answer to a five-word
question I've ever gotten...

341
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,394
is the answer to:
"Do you do much fly-fishing?"

342
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,392
It's a good answer,
Henry.

343
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,277
History's what
we're about too.

344
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,439
What else is there?

345
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,030
March, some guy about an automobile
insurance scam on line three.

346
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,919
Thanks.

347
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,912
Yes?

348
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,878
It's me. Please
don't hang up again.

349
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,509
Fuck you. March,
I'm in New Hampshire in a coffee shop.

350
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,632
I don't know when I'll get to the next phone.
Could you just listen for two minutes?

351
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,476
Listen, I think this guy
could be the real thing.

352
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,029
This guy could be so incredible,
you'd end up working for him.

353
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,397
This son of a bitch
actually likes these people.

354
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,919
He's worth the risk.
This guy could really do...

355
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,990
Henry, hey.

356
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,879
Help me get him outta here.
We have a fund-raiser in 20 minutes.

357
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,759
You bastard.
I waited for you all night.

358
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,319
I can explain about that.

359
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,671
I bought you some stuff at the drug store.
No, I can't.

360
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,592
I can't go to Mammoth Falls
without clothes.

361
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,471
Give me your keys. I'll have Daisy
pack things, bring them on Wednesday.

362
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,952
Why can't I pack
things and bring 'em on Wednesday?

363
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,157
Because by Wednesday
you'll be in Mississippi.

364
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,551
We have to set up the campaign headquarters
before we leave. So keys, please.

365
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,630
Hey.

366
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,835
I thought you were supposed
to be telling us to hurry.

367
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,319
I... Um...

368
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,509
Susan... Mrs. Stanton,
I'm not sure.

369
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,671
I mean,
I... I... I don't know.

370
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,310
I've never helped run a
presidential campaign before.

371
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,790
Well,
neither have we,

372
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,315
but that's how history
is made, Henry...

373
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,474
by the first-timers.

374
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,440
We are beginning
our pre-boarding procedure.

375
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,634
Are you, uh...

376
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,150
Is this...

377
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,993
Uh, where are
the state party people?

378
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,119
They're tied up with the
congressional races. We're it.

379
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,195
All right. All right.

380
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,233
Okay, get me the national
committee mailing lists...

381
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,750
of every donor
since the beginning of time.

382
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,831
Also, I need
a complete database

383
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,480
of voting records
on every possible candidate,

384
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,359
so we can set up a rapid
response negative operation.

385
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,716
How do we do that,
honey?

386
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,232
Don't you, uh...

387
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,677
Don't any of you have
any special skills?

388
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,278
I speak Hebrew.

389
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,470
Great.

390
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,871
Now double-click
on "Pro-Choice," Ella Louise.

391
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,155
All right.

392
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,197
Uh, now call up
the "Harris Vote."

393
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,873
- Like this?
- No! No!

394
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,311
Why can't I learn this?

395
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,076
This announcement is for
the candidate briefing on the 23rd.

396
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,914
Put it on 500 leaflets.

397
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,349
And then what?

398
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,479
Hand them out.

399
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,400
Goin' places
that I've never been

400
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,429
Call only the Orthodox
and conservative synagogues.

401
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,479
Speak only to the rabbis
and start off in Hebrew.

402
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,153
Check.
On the road again

403
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,560
How's that?
Fantastic.

404
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,119
Okay, we need
to file that with...

405
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,874
Excuse me.

406
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,111
- We need your vote.
- Terry.

407
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,555
Will you give them to your friends?
Terry!

408
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,949
- Terry.
- Thank you. Bye!

409
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,800
Ha-ha!

410
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,759
Look, just hold out the leaflets
for people. Don't stalk them.

411
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,513
Okay.

412
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,910
Hey, Henry.
Oh.

413
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,639
How y'all doing?
We're coming along.

414
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,440
We don't have
much staff yet, do we?

415
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,398
No, but what we have
is choice.

416
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,871
I want you to meet the most brilliant
political strategist in the party.

417
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,515
This is Richard Jemmons.
This is my right arm, Henry Burton.

418
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,034
Hi.

419
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,997
I sure admired
your granddaddy.

420
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,231
- Great.
- Henry.

421
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,755
I'll pick you up for dinner around
7:00 p.m. We can talk a little policy.

422
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,830
Right.

423
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,991
Nice meetin' you, Henry.
Say hi to Winona for me.

424
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,640
Who?
He means Jennifer Rogers.

425
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,631
Every girl Richard falls for
is Winona Ryder to him.

426
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,676
Oh, that's...

427
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,474
Psychotic.

428
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,432
On the road again

429
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,480
Like a band of gypsies
we go down the highway

430
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,114
We're the best of friends

431
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,958
Does that smell good,
or what?

432
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,834
Hey, Gov!
Hey! How y'all doin'?

433
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,319
Come on over here.

434
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,719
How's the food?

435
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,598
Willie.
Hi, honey.

436
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,398
I'm glad
you made it. Hi.

437
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,556
It smells so good.
Hey, good.

438
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,631
We got it
all set up for you.

439
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,110
Yeah!
He got chicken.

440
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,272
Hey, Will! How's business?
Hey, Gov.

441
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,353
Hey, Amalee, the gov's here.
It's hot.

442
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,076
You got your mojo workin' tonight?
Ain't no end to it.

443
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,992
My friend!
Loretta!

444
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,629
Hi, Governor.
How're you doin'? Hey, Lo!

445
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,518
Good to see you.

446
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,320
The gov's here!
How're you doin', now?

447
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,630
Hi. Henry Burton. Pleased to meet you.
Good to meet you.

448
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,472
Honey,
how's it goin'?

449
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,678
I had to tell Jackie you were too busy
working for the folks to baby-sit.

450
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,672
He was not happy.
Yes'm.

451
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,514
How're you doin'?
Welcome.

452
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,671
How're you doin',
Will?

453
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,838
Hey, not so good
since my mama died.

454
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,959
I miss her like a pain.
You gotta let that happen.

455
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,952
Your mama deserves it.

456
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,033
Your pain will heal with time,
but you gotta give your mama her due.

457
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,158
We gotta miss our mamas.
Ain't nobody gonna love us like our mamas.

458
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,516
You still got your mama
with you, Henry?

459
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,830
No, she's in Beverly Hills
with her second husband.

460
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,833
You're a lucky man.
Thank you.

461
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,674
The next time I see
my mama, she's blind.

462
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,395
A year later,
she's just got one leg from diabetes.

463
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,951
She could've done anything.
She could've been anything.

464
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,878
God bless the mamas.

465
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,549
My mama worked her whole life
and never asked for nothin'.

466
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,597
Shit, my mama
raised seven children.

467
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,950
If Ozio doesn't run,
we concentrate on New Hampshire.

468
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,633
If he does,
we concentrate on the South.

469
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,996
Ozio might wait
until New Hampshire.

470
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,479
Shouldn't we wait
for the governor?

471
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,234
This pertains to
how he's running the campaign.

472
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,878
He's on a mama-thon.
That can go on all night in the South.

473
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,075
We have to figure...

474
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,629
My mama worked her
whole life for her family...

475
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,554
and never did anything
for herself!

476
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,033
Now they're cuttin' her up!
Cuttin' pieces out of her!

477
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,592
Why'd that happen
to my mama?

478
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,514
I looked over Jordan
and what did I see

479
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,558
Comin' for to carry
me home

480
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,599
You know what Richard's
favorite song is?

481
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,038
I tell you that it is the most American
goddamn song that I can think of.

482
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,713
A Southern governor
wrote it.

483
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,797
You know which one
I'm thinking of?

484
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,315
You are my sunshine

485
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,789
My only sunshine

486
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,191
You make me happy
when skies are gray

487
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,840
I'll be damned. I didn't know
a Southern governor wrote that.

488
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:48,073
You'll never know, dear
how much I love you

489
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,470
Please don't take
my sunshine away

490
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,510
The other night, dear,
as I lay sleeping Come on, darlin'.

491
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:03,800
I dreamt I held you
in my arms

492
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,315
When I awoke, dear

493
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,154
I was mistaken

494
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,110
And I hung my head
and cried

495
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,116
You are my sunshine,
my only sunshine

496
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,275
You make me happy
when skies are gray

497
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,669
You'll never know, dear,
how much I love you

498
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,989
Henry, I have a printout

499
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,912
of every grassroots
organization in New Hampshire.

500
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,229
Great. Put it on my desk.

501
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,715
These rabbis
are putty in my hands.

502
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,870
Fantastic.

503
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,551
I started out with 200.
I have one left.

504
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,039
You know how I did it?
No.

505
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,269
Look.

506
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,476
Terry, I am
speechless.

507
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,237
Well, I think my grandfather
would endorse the governor, Jesse.

508
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,439
Even if you ran.
Okay. Yeah.

509
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,511
You too, my friend.
All right.

510
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,791
Where the fuck are my clothes?
Take it easy.

511
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,952
Daisy got sidetracked. She's not a muffin.
She works for Sporken.

512
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,078
What am I doing here?
Does this guy even have a chance in hell?

513
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,480
I haven't canvassed
hell lately.

514
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,552
If we only worked for guys who had a
chance in hell, we wouldn't have Richard.

515
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,749
Oh, shit, he's bird-dogging.

516
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,513
Sweetheart,
I got a hotel room.

517
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,557
Why don't you go
with me for a little bit?

518
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,119
You're crushing
my originals.

519
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,754
I didn't mean to do that.
You don't know what you're missing.

520
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,435
It's got room service, a vibrating bed.
Wait. Don't embarrass him.

521
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,080
Cable movies.
You wanna walk the snake?

522
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,436
What's that look?
You don't believe me?

523
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,239
Baby, I'm tellin' you,
I got a python in here.

524
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,030
Hey!

525
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,474
Gee, I've never seen one
that old before.

526
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,230
Come on, bud.

527
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,834
Let's park that Mustang
back in the garage.

528
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,158
She's not married,
is she?

529
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,077
Hey, fuck you!
Fuck me?

530
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,557
Fuck you, you redneck son of a bitch.
Ever hear of Anita Hill?

531
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,153
You are so lucky
she's cool.

532
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,992
I wouldn't have done it
if she wasn't cool.

533
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,793
You know when
the muffin is cool.

534
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,349
Your sensitive mind tells you
when to show her your cock.

535
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,999
Where'd you
go to school?

536
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,117
Hotchkiss, right?
I read up on you.

537
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,352
You're a tight-ass preppy
elitist from Hotchkiss. Bullshit!

538
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,276
Bullshit, it's bullshit! You called me
a redneck, which I'm proud to say I am.

539
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,919
You, Hotchkiss, are a honky.

540
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,879
You just look black.
It's the best part of you.

541
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,033
It lets you intimidate the pale
faces, especially lib-labs,

542
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,476
and work that voodoo
sexual shit on white girls.

543
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,230
I'm blacker than you are.
I got some slave in me. I can feel it.

544
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,829
You're crazy! What?

545
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,356
You got a visitor.
It's not a visitor. It's me.

546
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,475
Where the fuck
have you been?

547
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,597
Where is my suitcase?
I got it.

548
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,314
Can't let a lady carry
a suitcase, not in the South.

549
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,280
Henry, I am so glad that you
finally got a wardrobe,

550
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,149
We got a very important dinner
with a very important person. Who?

551
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,958
Governor Ozio's son.

552
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,316
What the fuck does
Ozio's son want?

553
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,756
A scouting expedition
for Pop, I guess.

554
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,595
But it could be Ozio is
looking for someone to endorse.

555
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,718
Jesus.

556
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,439
Wouldn't that
be something?

557
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,310
Mm-hmm.

558
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,513
This has to be handled
just right.

559
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,759
Just right.

560
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,911
Red Skelton.
That's what I remember.

561
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,832
Red Buttons.

562
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,594
All right. I hope you don't
mind eatin' pig with your hands.

563
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,910
Is there any other way?
Not in the South.

564
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,909
There we go.

565
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,435
The governor's been watching
you move around the country.

566
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,194
He was hoping the next time you
pass our way, you'd stop in,

567
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,354
spend a little time, get to know us better.
We will absolutely do that.

568
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,309
In fact, you got the book. When can we
meet with Jimmy's dad... Governor Ozio?

569
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,520
You don't mind us talking
business, do you? No.

570
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,873
How else will I learn?

571
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,919
Let's see.
We're pretty booked.

572
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,230
Next Tuesday we're in Albany
on the way to New Hampshire.

573
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,709
How's Tuesday?
Let's look.

574
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,598
Tuesday.

575
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,876
Let me just
scroll down here.

576
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,474
Tuesday's pretty full.

577
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,836
Maybe I can
slot you in somewhere.

578
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,957
Yeah.
Oh, um...

579
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,395
We land at 4:00,
then there's a drop-by

580
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,118
at the Teachers Union
cocktail party...

581
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,396
before their annual dinner
at the Sheraton.

582
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,877
I'd like to skip that,
but they'd notice.

583
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,470
I'm the only candidate
invited to the cocktail party.

584
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,070
I know.

585
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,790
The governor turned it down because
he's the keynote speaker at the dinner.

586
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,874
You'll both be at the Sheraton
at the same time.

587
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,520
You can meet after the cocktail
party, just before dinner,

588
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,240
in his suite.

589
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,119
Perfect.

590
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,550
I'll see him then.
Excellent.

591
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,590
Fuck all, Henry.
Fuck all.

592
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,070
You don't know fuck all
about briefing me!

593
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,670
You make me look like
a fuckin' amateur!

594
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,714
Like a rube-ass, barefoot, dipshit,
third-rate,

595
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,514
southern-fried
piece-of-shit alderman!

596
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,916
You didn't know that
Ozio was speaking at that dinner.

597
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,880
You couldn't tell me, so I don't go
shootin' my mouth off about that party.

598
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,714
Hello, Richard.

599
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,279
If you'd
like to make a call...

600
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,476
Shit!

601
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,074
What the fuck kind
of operation we got here?

602
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,358
How did we get scheduled for a
drop-in when he is the main speaker?

603
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,794
Get me Howard!

604
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,710
You threw the phone out the window.
Stop the car.

605
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,991
Don't kill us. Just stop it.

606
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,510
The phone landed in the brush.
You're wrong.

607
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,233
It landed in the trees.

608
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,274
I look like shit if I go
to that cocktail party.

609
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,114
I'm Ozio's warm-up act.
Don't think he didn't know it.

610
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,953
But somehow,
we didn't know it.

611
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,629
Get out of the goddamn brush.
It landed in the trees.

612
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,753
Jimmy Ozio is probably tellin' his
father he's got nothin' to worry about.

613
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,832
That would be the case
even if Henry hadn't screwed up.

614
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,276
Here's the phone.
It was in the brush.

615
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,793
Well, shit.

616
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,636
You wouldn't have found it if
I hadn't thrown it out the car.

617
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,674
Hello.

618
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,319
No.

619
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,038
No, sorry,
he's not here.

620
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,837
Henry Burton.
Can I take a message?

621
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,993
Oh.

622
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,879
Oh, God. I see.

623
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,916
No, no, no.
I got it. I got it.

624
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,554
How reliable is Daisy?

625
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,513
A hundred percent.
Then we just got really bad news.

626
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,711
In the next issue of
Manhattan magazine,

627
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,791
there's an interview with Ozio
in which he blasts you.

628
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,835
"What's he done? His state's
last in everything.

629
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,275
He doesn't know shit
about education."

630
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,153
Well, you were right
about the meeting.

631
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,478
This is bad.

632
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,879
- You have to hit back.
- But not too hard.

633
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,156
You don't want to lose the liberals.
You're gonna lose 'em anyway.

634
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,719
Richard,
are you with us?

635
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,679
I'd give him a little poke. It'll
make us look better when he drops out.

636
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,989
When who drops out?

637
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,436
- Ozio's 24 points ahead of us.
- That's the giveaway.

638
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,160
If he's willing to acknowledge
our presence,

639
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,516
he's the stupidest Italian
since Nero.

640
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,554
Or he's not gonna race.
He'll sit on his throne and snipe.

641
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,359
It doesn't matter.
I'm not gonna do it.

642
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,750
Jack!

643
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,433
I'm not gonna go negative.

644
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,710
Any jackass can
burn down a barn.

645
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,599
It's self-defense.
I'm not gonna do it!

646
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,593
Shane!

647
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,637
Come back!

648
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,230
Come back, Shane!

649
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,957
Run for president.

650
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,910
Hello?

651
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,958
How're you doin', Henry?
Uh, fine.

652
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,515
Look, there's been
a bender on the interstate.

653
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,751
I'm on my way to meet with the
family, so cancel Howard.

654
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,271
Uh, yeah. Okay.

655
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,960
And, Governor, look.

656
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,909
About the Teachers
Union dinner...

657
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,992
Listen, my man.
I know how much I lay on you.

658
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,198
I know how hard you work for me.
And I'm honored by it.

659
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,874
I'm honored.
Yeah, but I should have thought...

660
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,758
It didn't occur to me...
Forget it.

661
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,753
Get out of that office
for a while and rest.

662
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,474
Stay home, crack open
a bottle of Chablis.

663
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,632
What you doing this weekend, Henry?
Uh, this weekend.

664
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,831
I'm setting up
a list of meetings...

665
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,355
You think it's possible
to get yourself laid?

666
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,473
Sir?
I'm serious.

667
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,911
I don't want you too horny to think
straight or too burned out to kick ass

668
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,150
when we really need
to start rolling.

669
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,754
What you doin' Thanksgiving?
What?

670
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,878
You said your mama's in Beverly
Hills, so if you're free,

671
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,879
maybe you'd like to spend it
with Susan, Jackie and me.

672
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,510
It's not the same as being with your
mama, but we're family too.

673
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,150
Uh, thank you.
Yes, I... I would like that.

674
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,355
Well, good.

675
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,439
And, Henry, the reason
I won't take on Ozio

676
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,355
is that I don't want to give that son of a
bitch the power to make me the son of a bitch.

677
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,114
All right?
See you, Henry.

678
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,040
Right.

679
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,951
Dear Lord,
thank you for what we're about to receive.

680
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,394
Amen.

681
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,279
All right, son.
Here we go.

682
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,040
Happy Thanksgiving,
everybody!

683
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,993
Who the hell are all these people?
Most are from shelters.

684
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,549
You're kidding.
No, he invites them every year.

685
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,873
That's the good news. The bad news
is he also invites his friends.

686
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,878
People he's been collecting
since kindergarten

687
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,355
so he can take them
aboard when he sails.

688
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,317
Some of them
really suck.

689
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,279
Henry. Daisy.

690
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,909
She has the same problem. Right.

691
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,152
I want you to meet Lucille Kaufman,
an old friend from New York.

692
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,470
I marched
with your grandfather.

693
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,630
Hello, Lucille.

694
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,233
Lucille and I went
to law school together.

695
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,630
Let's get a drink.
You're Jack's coordinator?

696
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,430
Can't you do something about his clothes
and the color of the campaign posters?

697
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,591
And Arlen Sporken,
while you're at it.

698
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,513
If I wasn't swamped,
I'd join the campaign full-time.

699
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,234
Henry, I want you
to meet my son Jackie.

700
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,990
Hi, Jackie. This is our family
doctor, Dr. Beauregard.

701
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,400
Henry, you and Jack are gonna have to find
yourselves a way to educate them Yankees.

702
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,358
Maybe if they both
wear capes.

703
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,479
This is Randy Culligan.
I gave him his first job as a law clerk.

704
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,190
Whoo!

705
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,435
Refried black-eyed peas

706
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,399
More corn and chicken fries
Gumbo, rice

707
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,720
Thinks that I am

708
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,189
Unforgettable too

709
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,152
Hey, folks. May I
have your attention here?

710
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,235
Folks, you all know me.
I'm Jackie Stanton's mama.

711
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,396
How 'bout if we
sing us a chorus...

712
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,790
of You Are My Sunshine...
Yeah!

713
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,954
...in honor of the great
Southern governors of America.

714
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,990
You are my
sunshine, my only sunshine

715
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,314
You make me happy when skies
are gray

716
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,839
You'll never know, dear,
how much I love you Hello. Huh?

717
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,709
Please don't take my
sunshine away You're kidding?

718
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,678
Hey! Hey, hey,
hey, hey!

719
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,390
Wait. Hold up.
Ozio just dropped out.

720
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,080
That's fantastic!
Yes!

721
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,993
Gentlemen, welcome
to the first debate...

722
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,356
of the Democratic
presidential primary.

723
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,678
I remind you to keep your
responses to one minute. Okay.

724
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,434
Senator Martin. Oh, God.
I'm so nervous I'm sick.

725
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,399
It's three weeks
to the primary.

726
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,312
What I want to say
about health care

727
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,678
is that although it's vital that every
man, woman and child be covered,

728
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,959
it's also vital that we
conserve as well as expend.

729
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,313
We're providing a safety net
for folks on welfare

730
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,233
who otherwise would be unable
to get off welfare. Oh, shit.

731
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,596
Oh, man.
What did you just see?

732
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,478
Uh, nothing. No one.

733
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,550
Y'all are missing

734
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,950
one of the great assholes
of our time back there.

735
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,831
I can't help feeling sad
as I listen to Senator Martin.

736
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,319
Lookin' sad.

737
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,791
I remember a time when
being a Democrat meant more...

738
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,679
than just giving welfare
recipients a safety net.

739
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,598
It meant giving them
a ladder.

740
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,593
It meant giving them a way to
climb back to an equal height.

741
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,310
It meant dignity.
I say if we don't control spending,

742
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,040
we don't shore up the economy
of this great country of ours,

743
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,992
our economy will go under.

744
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,873
This is a new
economic era.

745
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,276
Who are we shoring
the economy up for?

746
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,000
Your bond-holding fat cats?
I'd like to know.

747
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,597
It's not just bondholders. Ordinary
men and women will benefit as well.

748
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,991
Goddamn it.
Why is he doing this?

749
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,279
Because he's just gotta get on
the good side of Lawrence Harris.

750
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,795
A lower deficit means,
among other things,

751
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,076
that working families will
have lower mortgage rates.

752
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,471
Okay, not bad, but shut up.
We're okay.

753
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,029
Governor Nilson's idea
has got merit.

754
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,716
We do need to provide jobs for
those who need work. That is true.

755
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,359
Jack, excuse me.

756
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,638
What, if anything,
are you against?

757
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:01,039
I... I'm against doing nothing
while people are suffering.

758
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,352
I'm against dismissing
any idea that might help

759
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,511
because it isn't my idea.

760
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,672
Senator, you have met these
people, looked into their eyes.

761
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,713
Are you saying we should do nothin'
to help unless we come up with it?

762
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,269
Nailed him!
He's toast!

763
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,596
Hell, yes!
What I meant was...

764
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,831
Kickin' ass
and takin' names!

765
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,275
Grand slam.
As good as it gets.

766
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,158
Hi. How was I?

767
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,516
You took it, honey.
It was yours. Sure.

768
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,671
Governor, March Cunningham,
The Black Advocate.

769
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,396
<i>Were you ever arrested
during the Vietnam War?</i>

770
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,470
No.

771
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,951
You were never
arrested in Chicago?

772
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,676
I was accidentally detained.

773
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,992
Then released.
The record was expunged.

774
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,071
You remember how
you were released?

775
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,710
They realized it was a mistake.
It was a long time ago.

776
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,799
- Check your records.
- Honey, we're gonna be late.

777
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,350
Henry? You guys go ahead.
I'll meet you. Go on.

778
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,191
What are you
doing here?

779
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,711
Why is The Black Advocate
suddenly interested in Stanton?

780
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,678
They're not. I am.

781
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,400
I'm trying to find out who he is
because a friend of mine works for him.

782
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,551
Oh, March. Come on.
Don't do this.

783
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,790
I thought you might
be interested too.

784
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,678
Do you know why
he was released?

785
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,229
He called a senator
to get him out of jail

786
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,597
and then persuaded the mayor of
Chicago to have his record expunged.

787
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,671
<i>"So"?
So? I?</i>

788
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,793
You don't care that this guy was
already so manipulative in the 60's...

789
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,076
that he got into bed
with the mayor of Chicago,

790
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,993
the same mayor that busted the
protestors at the Democratic Convention?

791
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,313
No, I don't care. Stanton was
never a radical. He's a politician.

792
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,034
He couldn't get elected with a
record, so he had that expunged.

793
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,397
That's the kind of man you want to work for,
somebody who just wants to get elected?

794
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,239
No, I want to work for a man
who fights the good fight,

795
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,919
then watch a Republican
get elected.

796
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,714
What's the difference? Can you tell?
I can tell the difference

797
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,395
between a man who believes what
I believe and lies to get elected

798
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,279
and a man who... who just
doesn't give a fuck.

799
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,831
I'll take the liar.
How did he do this to you?

800
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,998
Do what? What?
What are you...

801
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,271
Why are you making this guy
into the devil?

802
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,434
Why don't you at least get to know
him, maybe spend a few days with us?

803
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,750
Honey, I miss you,
and we could be together.

804
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,638
God.

805
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,838
I think you'd fuck me to get
some good press for Stanton.

806
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,634
We're in trouble.

807
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,072
What does she have?

808
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,989
What the fuck is The Black
Advocate doing covering Stanton?

809
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,718
They're not.
It's... She's...

810
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,595
It's personal.

811
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,996
Well, it don't matter.
We're fucked.

812
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,720
If some little shitty paper
like The Black Advocate's

813
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,552
got a reporter
who can dig this up,

814
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,149
then we're fuckin'
flying blind in the wind.

815
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,277
Now they're all
gonna come after us.

816
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,636
Did you see any other president
up there on the stage tonight?

817
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,280
We're the fucking
ball game.

818
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:16,432
Now every flea that ever nipped his
ass is gonna want a piece of us.

819
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,592
It's gonna be the war thing,
the drug thing, the woman thing.

820
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,354
That's the killer right there. You're
gonna have to talk to him about that.

821
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,955
Me? No. Hey,
you're the strategy guy.

822
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,072
But you're the body man.

823
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,072
Maybe we can talk
to Susan.

824
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,231
Are you out
of your fuckin' mind?

825
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,959
"Mrs. Stanton, we need to know who the governor's
plugging so we can have spin control."

826
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,872
All right, then,
let's just quit.

827
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,270
If everyone's gonna take a bite out of
him, we're not gonna say anything,

828
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,113
let's go work for someone we're
not too chickenshit to protect.

829
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,032
All right. We'll set up a meeting.
Him or her?

830
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,032
Shit, her!
Her!

831
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,751
Goddamn,
this is gonna be rough.

832
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,354
So, I have to be in Concord
in an hour to meet Jack.

833
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,079
What's the crisis?

834
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,552
It's campaign business.
It's, uh, private.

835
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,030
Please, if it's not
too private for you...

836
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,192
Lucille is one of my closest
friends and part of this campaign.

837
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,552
What's the crisis?

838
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,117
Say you're out in the woods
taking a shit...

839
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,760
and a wild boar
comes charging at ya.

840
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,957
Now, do you pull
your britches up and run?

841
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,236
Or do you try to pull your britches
up and grab the doves you just shot,

842
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,118
and then try to run,
all at the same time?

843
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,840
Or do you just forget about the fuckin'
doves, pull your britches up and run,

844
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,594
'cause you ain't got time
to aim and button your fly?

845
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,472
And if you miss,

846
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,593
well... you don't want to die
with your dick hanging out.

847
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,034
You see what
I'm sayin'?

848
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,792
I think I speak for everyone
in the room when I say no.

849
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,630
Well, I mean, uh,

850
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,510
what if you're not
prepared for the boar,

851
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,275
and you get caught with your
britches down and lose the doves?

852
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,193
All right, what Richard
is saying is...

853
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,869
If you get caught
in the forest...

854
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,395
Don't give us a "taking a shit
in the woods" metaphor again.

855
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,118
Tell us what you
are talking about.

856
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,349
Okay.

857
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,469
Say that this boar is part...
I don't believe this.

858
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,313
Who do the boars represent,
the Republicans?

859
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,511
No, the press. The press?

860
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,353
Yes. Don't they?

861
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,989
Yeah, the press.

862
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,669
Now, you're dealing
with these wild boars.

863
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,754
Oh, God. Suddenly they start
saying things like "marijuana."

864
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,033
"Chicago." Maybe a woman
comes forward and says...

865
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,760
Bullshit.
That's not gonna happen.

866
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,793
Absolutely not.
I don't think so either.

867
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,314
But...

868
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,317
I'm just trying
to figure this out.

869
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,560
If it did happen,

870
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:35,270
then he's not gonna get trapped like
Hart, 'cause we know the rules.

871
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,910
If some bimbo from a former life comes
forward, we just say, "Bullshit."

872
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,072
Bullshit is right.
What are you suggesting we do?

873
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,512
How would you deal with it?
By knowing more than they do.

874
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,151
By being prepared, so when a story like Chicago
comes up, we fight back with the truth.

875
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,437
How are we supposed to know what kind
of garbage they're gonna come up with?

876
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,229
That's the point, Lucille.
That's the whole ever-fuckin' point.

877
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,839
We need to hire an operative
to do research, you see?

878
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,839
We need somebody that can get at...
Investigate our lives.

879
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,629
Investigate everything anybody
can make an allegation about.

880
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,957
That's ridiculous.
We don't play that game.

881
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,509
That's the media's game.
We play the people's game.

882
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,392
We say, "The Republicans
and the media

883
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,879
want the election
to be about trash.

884
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,838
We want it to be
about your future."

885
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,436
We don't shoot doves in this campaign.
We protect them.

886
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,514
What do you mean?

887
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,195
Well, don't the doves
represent the people?

888
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,713
No. Then I don't
understand who the doves are.

889
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,838
Forget the doves.
Henry, you agree with this?

890
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,790
- Yes.
- Okay.

891
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,437
We'll do it.
I'll tell the governor.

892
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,358
I want Libby Holden.
Oh, my God!

893
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,876
If we're gonna get someone to find the
dirt, we have to have someone who knows us,

894
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,997
someone we trust
completely.

895
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,230
But I mean,
is she out of the hospital?

896
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,355
Yes.

897
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,670
She's okay now?
Who is she?

898
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,639
She was Jack's chief of staff 20 years ago.
She had a breakdown.

899
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,870
She just suddenly
became incoherent

900
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,280
in the middle
of a press conference.

901
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,233
It was awful. She's been in and
out of mental hospitals for years.

902
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,920
She seems very stable now.
She's been home for 18 months.

903
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,911
You and Henry can fly back
tomorrow and brief her.

904
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,430
Well, that's good...
that she's stable,

905
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,831
because you're kind of putting the
whole campaign in her hands now.

906
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,911
Yes, I know.

907
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,156
Well, that's good.

908
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,911
Are we the doves?
Lucille, I think we can forget the metaphor.

909
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,152
Actually, I think we're the ones
taking the shit in the woods.

910
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,038
Hey, Ella.
Henry.

911
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:47,000
Oh, I'm just thrilled
y'all came back.

912
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,356
I got a million messages
for you.

913
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,909
He looks like a band leader.
I'm getting rid of it.

914
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,278
Hey, Henry,
how're you doin'?

915
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,193
On behalf of Jack Stanton,
we'd like to thank you for your support.

916
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:04,240
Never call 'em secretaries. Always call
'em assistants. Jennifer, look who's back!

917
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,789
Henry! Oh!

918
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,877
Shalom.

919
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,395
You're working on Friday
and wearing a yarmulke.

920
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,199
I'm dressed for work.
How you doin', H.B.?

921
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,239
I'm here!
Who's talkin' to me?

922
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,471
Uh, Miss Holden?

923
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,229
Henry Burton.
Ah-ha.

924
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,199
Hi, I'm Terry Hicks.

925
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,749
Jennifer.
Uh-huh.

926
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,560
Hello, Lib.
Hello, shit-for-brains.

927
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,836
You learned how
to watch your mouth yet?

928
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,390
I will not let you fuck up this
campaign too. I will not let it happen!

929
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,393
Uh...
That was 20 years ago.

930
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,915
Yes, I was thinner then.
I had a waist.

931
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,238
Peter Goldsmith.
Ella Louise Harriman.

932
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,277
Where is this happening?
What?

933
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,589
The fucking meeting!

934
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,793
I will need a safe house.

935
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,078
I know the house.
Little, nice rose garden.

936
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,312
Call Becky Raymond.
673-4982.

937
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,277
Tell her it's for the governor.
She'll know what you mean.

938
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,279
Now, staff.

939
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,798
I want that one,
the one who looks like Winona Ryder.

940
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,997
Gorgeous.
Is she smart?

941
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,912
Oh, she's smart.

942
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,833
I want her as soon as the
meeting's over. Start.

943
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,555
Well, um, a reporter
for The Black Advocate

944
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,677
dug up the governor's
Chicago arrest.

945
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,354
We know we can't stop that.
Why stop it? It's a paper trail.

946
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,874
Chicago's not
that important.

947
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,953
But we're concerned
there may be other things.

948
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,077
Like Cashmere McLeod.
Uh, who?

949
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,959
Boy, you really
don't know shit, do you?

950
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,439
You mean Susan's hairdresser?

951
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,999
And Jack's porkpie.

952
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,755
What? For Christ's
sake, act your age.

953
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,753
Jack Stanton fucks around,
and he's got enemies.

954
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,635
But what, Susan's hairdresser?
What can she do to us?

955
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,231
She can sell her story
to the Flash for 150,000,

956
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,594
minus the ten percent she's giving to the
slime-suckin', down-on-his-luck attorney...

957
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,671
who's agenting
the deal for her.

958
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,549
You know this?
No, I imagined it in the booby hatch!

959
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,070
It's bullshit.

960
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,639
In your dreams, sweetheart.

961
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,639
She can't hurt us.
She has no proof.

962
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,950
She has no credibility.
It's bullshit.

963
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,917
She's the tip
of the iceberg.

964
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,515
Our Jackie's done some pretty
stupid things in his life.

965
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,439
He's poked his pecker
in some sorry trash bins.

966
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,520
We gotta stop 'em
before they stop us.

967
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,754
We gotta crush 'em
and sweep 'em up.

968
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,311
From now on, you can
call me the Dustbuster.

969
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,751
You know, honey child?
I'm stronger than dirt.

970
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,638
I believe you.

971
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,275
We could offer her 200,000 not to print it.
Then kill her to make sure?

972
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,471
The important thing is
he didn't do anything wrong,

973
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,880
he has nothing
to be defensive about.

974
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,600
He should act pissed off. But not too
pissed off. He's running for president.

975
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,672
It should be like, "Well, it's too
bad, but we don't take it seriously."

976
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,038
This ain't as frightening
as things that happen to people,

977
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,753
like losing your job
or getting foreclosed.

978
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,672
- Where the fuck's the light?
- I'm looking for it.

979
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,434
Like, "Shit happens, but
we're calm in a shit storm."

980
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,759
Or maybe it's, "We expected
this crap to happen."

981
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,389
Right.
The usual media trash bash.

982
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,073
Why did he do it?

983
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,437
Did he figure Cashmere McLeod would be
so honored she'd never betray the secret?

984
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,918
Wait a minute. Maybe it isn't true.
What difference does it make?

985
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,718
It'd be better
if it wasn't true.

986
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,959
Why? They say Hitler never looked
at another woman after Eva Braun.

987
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,633
Does that make him
better than Stanton?

988
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,793
Or Jefferson, Kennedy, or any of the guys
we wish we worked for who fucked around?

989
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,669
But that's not the official
line for interviews.

990
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:30,512
No, of course not.

991
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,071
Today a potentially explosive
development for Governor Jack Stanton

992
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,471
in his quest for the Democratic
presidential nomination.

993
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,278
A hairdresser has come
forward alleging

994
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,550
a long-term affair
with the married candidate.

995
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,918
The story, as yet unconfirmed,
appeared today in the Flash.

996
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,071
There has been no statement
yet from the governor...

997
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,197
regarding the young woman,
Cashmere McLeod...

998
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,113
Unbelievable... but the
accusation comes right on the heels...

999
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:59,195
of the disclosure that Governor Stanton
was arrested in 1968 in Chicago.

1000
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,596
Fuckin' Eye Witness News.
Goddamn it.

1001
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,560
Ted Koppel wants someone from the team
for his show. 60 Minutes wants a Sunday...

1002
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,917
Do we have to take this?
They're gonna dignify this garbage.

1003
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:12,078
We have to go along with that?
Well, we can't ignore it.

1004
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,994
They might have given him Chicago
'cause that was 30 years ago,

1005
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,594
and they might have given him
Cashmere because she was paid.

1006
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,718
But the two right on top of one another...
You see what I'm saying?

1007
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,593
How many people are going
to be saying,

1008
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,718
"Do we want a former radical hippie
that messes with hairdressers?"

1009
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,315
He did not fuck
Cashmere McLeod.

1010
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,593
If you can't handle that simple
fact, you can leave right now.

1011
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,599
All right.
Let's think this through.

1012
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,915
Who has thoughts about
60 Minutes?

1013
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,471
Well, I think you do it. I think
you say yes to all these interviews,

1014
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,631
and show 'em we ain't
got a thing to hide.

1015
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,599
And the sooner the better.
We have two weeks left to the primary.

1016
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,196
Right.
And I think we should take the attitude

1017
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,634
that we expected this
to happen, you know?

1018
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,109
It's just the usual
bullshit media trash bash.

1019
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,431
Shit happens,
but we're calm in a shit storm, you know?

1020
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,672
This is not near as bad as things
that happen to real people.

1021
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,558
Do you agree, Henry?

1022
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,834
My problem is I go out
and I run and I work out,

1023
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,914
and then I come in here and eat donuts.

1024
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,913
Well, you know, you got to eat something.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1025
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:54,199
I mean, the thing is,
is just not to eat too many of 'em.

1026
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,318
I believe you're right.
If you could just have a little bit.

1027
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:01,030
Hey, Governor. Henry, my man.
Sit down. Have some coffee.

1028
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,350
No, I'm okay.
You gonna get some sleep tonight?

1029
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,273
Hmm. Absolutely.
Don't you worry about me.

1030
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,318
I was just going over
some ideas with Danny here.

1031
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,030
Danny Scanlon, this is
my friend Henry Burton.

1032
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,516
Can I get you something, Mr. Burton?
Apple fritter? No, thanks.

1033
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,793
You know that Danny here
works here every night,

1034
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,235
twelve-hour shift,
$5.25 an hour?

1035
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,359
But like I was telling
the governor, I don't mind.

1036
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,592
I would mind if I couldn't work.
How about an apple fritter?

1037
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,234
Uh, not for me.

1038
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,190
What was the best game you saw all
year, Danny? College, not pro.

1039
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,472
Utah State
versus San Diego State.

1040
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,519
Oh, yes, that was
a great game, wasn't it?

1041
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,110
Yeah, I saw that.
It was a great ground game.

1042
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,315
Yep. You gotta have a good ground game.
Yeah, you do.

1043
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,069
Apple fritter?
No, I, I just said...

1044
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,675
I... I'll have one,
Dan, but just one. Okay.

1045
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:57,675
I will make some fresh coffee,
and if you want some, you call me.

1046
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,273
All right, Danny.
Thank you.

1047
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:07,793
You look tired, Governor.
Maybe it's time to go home.

1048
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,516
They're gonna kill me with trash.
Not if you don't let them.

1049
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,956
It's my own fault. It's my own goddamned
fault. I didn't keep it together.

1050
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:20,150
We can still win this thing.
We're going to win it.

1051
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:23,320
But the hits you're taking are
nothing compared to

1052
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,589
what average folks
are going through.

1053
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,670
Hmm.

1054
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,910
Losing their jobs,
losing their homes.

1055
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,911
Keep that in your mind.
Yes.

1056
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,991
Keep the folks in your mind.

1057
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,639
It's about them,
isn't it?

1058
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,950
Yeah, it's about them.
It's about history.

1059
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:40,472
Well, that's truer for Susan than it
is for me. It's always been about them.

1060
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,551
Like this fella,
Danny Scanlon.

1061
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,356
Worked every day
since he was 14.

1062
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,833
Couldn't get insurance,
couldn't get his leg fixed right.

1063
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,039
Doesn't complain.

1064
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,839
Doesn't do anyone any harm.
Achin' to do good.

1065
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,757
God, if you...

1066
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,279
If you let a man
like that go down,

1067
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,829
you don't deserve to take up
space on this planet, do you?

1068
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,150
We won't let him
go down.

1069
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,475
Sh...

1070
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,309
- Yeah.
- Bummer, Henry, bummer.

1071
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,911
Libby?
Yeah. She's got tapes.

1072
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,514
Who?
Who's got tapes?

1073
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,916
Cashmere, the hair slut,
you moron.

1074
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,758
She's gonna play 'em at her
press conference tomorrow.

1075
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,990
I do not have time
for ineptitude.

1076
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,430
Now go tell Jack and Susan
the cunt's got tapes,

1077
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,915
and get your ass
back to Mammoth Falls.

1078
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,557
Hey, Henry.
Morning.

1079
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,109
Honey, I have to run.
I will. Hold on.

1080
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,314
The new member of the swimming
team wants to talk to you.

1081
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,553
Hey, Jackie boy.
That's great. You made it.

1082
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,394
Well, that's great.
We're proud of you.

1083
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,431
Yeah. No, no, just a bunch of
campaign garbage, that's all.

1084
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,397
Governor, this...
this can't wait.

1085
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,632
All right. Well, we'll call you tonight.
I love you too. Bye-bye.

1086
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,553
What is it?
I was just talking to Libby.

1087
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,473
She says Cashmere McLeod has
tape recordings of you and her

1088
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,193
talking on
the phone together,

1089
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,880
and she's gonna play them at
a press conference tomorrow.

1090
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,429
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- How bad?

1091
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:46,230
I don't know. Did you tell her...
Henry, could you excuse us, please?

1092
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,720
Sure.

1093
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,478
Well, it is cold here, Sam,
but these are friendly people.

1094
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,709
It reminds me a lot of home.

1095
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,473
I like her hair
that way.

1096
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:05,520
It softens her face. Yes.
Could be longer, though.

1097
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,678
If you hung out
with us for a day,

1098
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:11,310
you'd see what the folks are
really interested in is the future.

1099
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,760
He's gotten fat.

1100
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,150
And he jogs. Can you
imagine how much he eats?

1101
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,953
Can you imagine
what he eats?

1102
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,553
What's he
governor of again?

1103
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,519
Let me see. It's not Georgia.
Governor, just to set the record straight,

1104
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,240
did you have an affair with
Cashmere McLeod? Not Florida.

1105
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,756
Now, Sam, I am not gonna
dignify that trash.

1106
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,594
And I am disappointed,
at a time when the American people...

1107
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,512
have an awful lot
they're concerned about,

1108
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:36,036
I saw a picture of the hairdresser.
Not bad.

1109
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,350
We've had tough times in our
marriage, but we've worked them out.

1110
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,113
I don't think
this is fair.

1111
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,389
People suffer and struggle and go
through all sorts of crazy things.

1112
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,631
The important thing is
we're still here.

1113
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:52,472
If you want to draw a political lesson
from that about Jack's character,

1114
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,597
<i>here it is:
He will stick.</i>

1115
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,149
He will work
through the tough times.

1116
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:01,115
He will wake up every morning and
bust his butt for the American people.

1117
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,470
"Bust his butt."
The mouth on her.

1118
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,437
He should just take
her in hand.

1119
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,998
Yeah, right. Yeah, but she's honest.
They had some tough times.

1120
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,680
Maybe that's when he screwed
the hairdresser.

1121
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,589
And with that we come to
the end of The Week In Washington.

1122
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,751
Governor and Mrs.
Stanton, thank you for joining us. Yeah?

1123
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,513
- Hi.
- Thank you.

1124
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:21,829
Are you watching?

1125
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,479
Yeah, it's just
going off now.

1126
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,838
We're out.
Thanks, everybody.

1127
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,319
And it's over.
How'd it play where you are?

1128
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,238
Wasn't she fantastic?

1129
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:36,274
Yeah, great. But they'd like to
see her hair a little longer.

1130
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,834
Watch your step, sir.
Thank you.

1131
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,959
Hey.

1132
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,037
Hey! Henry!

1133
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,669
Oh, it's good to see you.
How ya doin'?

1134
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,239
How long you in town for?
Not long.

1135
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:58,359
No time to talk. We gotta get to Sailor's
and watch old Cashmere with an expert.

1136
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,917
You take care
of yourself now, dear.

1137
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,190
I'll be home for dinner.
We'll take my truck.

1138
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,033
Uh, I...

1139
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,710
And
my friends around to help me.

1140
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,553
So you met Jack and Susan in
Florida working for McGovern?

1141
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,359
What were they like?
Yep.

1142
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,038
Glorious.
Golden. Golden.

1143
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:30,760
And here I am just
missing you again Did they have any...

1144
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,673
Please, mister, please.

1145
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,352
Don't play B-17.

1146
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,310
It was our song.
It was her song.

1147
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,029
Sing with me, Henry.
But it's over.

1148
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:47,431
Please, mister, please.

1149
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:51,190
If you know what I mean.
All right!

1150
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:55,751
I don't ever want to play
that song again.

1151
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,714
Ha ha ha!

1152
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,109
Sailorman!

1153
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,798
Libby. Good to see ya, girl.

1154
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,200
How was the booby hatch?

1155
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:09,033
Well, a better class of drugs
than the old days.

1156
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,958
- Where's the beer?
- Hey.

1157
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,677
Welcome to the world of electronics.
Brewski. Thanks.

1158
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,274
Cashmere McLeod and
her attorney are about to make...

1159
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,079
Here she comes...
Public the tapes
which she says prove her allegations...

1160
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,551
Recording.
...against Governor Jack Stanton.

1161
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,474
I know just what she looked
like in high school.

1162
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,955
I'm Sherman Presley,
Ms. McLeod's attorney.

1163
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,952
I want to make
one thing clear.

1164
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,999
We'll take no questions until
after the playing of the tapes.

1165
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,597
And this will not
be an inquisition.

1166
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,956
Yeah, right.
We get the inquisition.

1167
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:47,113
The tapes were recorded on
Miss McLeod's phone machine.

1168
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:50,792
Portions you're about to hear were
recorded just before Thanksgiving.

1169
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,553
Governor Jack Stanton
seduced me...

1170
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,790
Can you back that up?

1171
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,277
...and I have tapes
to prove it.

1172
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,559
I'm on my way
to meet with the family.

1173
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,233
But you said you loved me.

1174
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:10,309
You said no one could do
the things I did to you.

1175
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:14,356
I could come up there.
God, what a whiny bitch!

1176
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,109
Remember that time
I met you in Dallas?

1177
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,477
<i>Hmm. I get hot
just thinkin' about it.</i>

1178
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,437
- Oh, my God.
- What you doin' this weekend?

1179
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:25,512
Mmm, nothing,
now that you're leaving.

1180
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,990
Stay home, crack open
a bottle of Chablis.

1181
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,515
Do you think it's at all
possible to get laid?

1182
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:34,958
<i>I'd say it's entirely
possible, if you postpone that trip.</i>

1183
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,673
I'm too horny
to think straight.

1184
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:42,229
As you can see, these tapes were, uh,
recorded on Miss McLeod's phone machine...

1185
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,596
All right, I'm recording the rest
of this bullshit. Let's get to work.

1186
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:48,071
I'm gonna kill him.
How could he be so fuckin' dumb?

1187
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,470
There's a couple of abrupt
cutouts in here. Let's replay it.

1188
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,750
I'm on my
way to meet with the family.

1189
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,911
That's a pretty
abrupt cutout right there.

1190
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,112
What you doin'
this weekend?

1191
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,111
That's picked up
in midsentence, I think.

1192
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,315
I mean, it could be.

1193
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,236
Stay home, crack open
a bottle of Chablis.

1194
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,837
Do you think it's at all
possible to get laid?

1195
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,118
Now, that breakup
in the middle,

1196
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,999
that could be cellular static,
or they might have used it to cover.

1197
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:14,436
Wait a second.
Wait a goddamned second.

1198
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,430
Play that line again.

1199
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,356
Do you think it's at all
possible to get laid?

1200
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:24,991
"At all possible
to get laid." Again.

1201
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,912
What?
Just again, damn it.

1202
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,469
Do you think it's at all
possible to get laid?

1203
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:36,232
Yourself.
Yourself!

1204
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,840
Hello? You're not crackin' up, are you?
'Cause two of us would be one too many.

1205
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,152
Un-fucking-believable!
Yourself...

1206
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,596
He said, "Do you think it's at all
possible to get yourself laid?"

1207
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,957
He was talking to me. He said he didn't
want me too horny to think straight.

1208
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,832
It was just before
Thanksgiving.

1209
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,880
Okay, look. Play it again from the top.
Just his lines. One at a time.

1210
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:00,192
Shit! JACK: I'm on my way
to meet with the family.

1211
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,078
"Meet with the family."

1212
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,436
There was an accident, uh,
a bender on the interstate.

1213
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,160
That's the family he was gonna meet.
Okay, next line, his.

1214
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,278
What you doin'
this weekend?

1215
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,879
An abrupt cutout, right?

1216
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,519
Yep.

1217
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,557
He said, "What are you doin'
this weekend, Henry?"

1218
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:20,234
I remember he called me Henry. I remember
the whole call, it meant so much to me.

1219
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,630
Ha! Jesus Christ!
We got her!

1220
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,312
You got her. We don't.
How do we prove it?

1221
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,672
Ah, no, no.
No. Libby, they...

1222
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,957
We can't let 'em
get away with this.

1223
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:37,160
Come on. This cannot be a world
that lets them get away with it!

1224
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:41,393
Oh, my. Imagine a black boy sayin' that.
What a privileged fuckin' life you've had.

1225
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,438
But never mind
about the world, baby.

1226
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,194
I won't let 'em get away
with it. I will find a way.

1227
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,837
I'm gonna get a lead on where Ted
Koppel and Larry King are this weekend.

1228
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,991
Can you nail the conversations
on their cellulars?

1229
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,549
Have to rent a van, track 'em.
Sure. Do it.

1230
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,837
Then we'll pick the best one.
Let's go, Henry.

1231
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,313
We gotta change
the world now.

1232
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,238
You asshole!

1233
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:08,837
Yes, it was off a cellular telephone, but
don't pull that outraged-puppy shit with me.

1234
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,038
It's not like you've suddenly become
an innocent because the tape is phony.

1235
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,318
God! I wish we'd castrated you
when we had the chance.

1236
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,512
Libby, you're talking on a
cellular phone! Oh, shit!

1237
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,598
Yes, I... Goddamned
sure I know who did it.

1238
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,510
Yes.

1239
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,676
I'll get it done.
Okay. Bye.

1240
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,996
W... W... Wait a minute.
You know who did it?

1241
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,674
Yes. Oh, yes, indeedy.

1242
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,316
What the...
Triumphant day, huh, Randy?

1243
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,038
Perhaps your best day.

1244
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:43,397
Is that Cashmere on the line?
Let me say hi. No, it's not.

1245
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:46,074
Say good-bye to Sherman Presley, then.
We've got business.

1246
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,992
It's not Sherman Presley,
whoever he is.

1247
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,754
You've branched out, Randy.
Electronics now, huh?

1248
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,160
I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

1249
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,551
You've been recording your friend the
governor's private conversations, haven't you?

1250
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:58,439
What? Are you...
Come on, why would I do that?

1251
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:01,320
I'm a big Stanton supporter.
I always have been.

1252
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,391
Why, he's puttin' this state
right on the map.

1253
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:06,996
I've only been here 20 seconds and
you've already exhausted my patience.

1254
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,673
I'm gonna want
a signed confession.

1255
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:12,270
L... L... Libby, put that thing away before you do
something stupid and get yourself into trouble!

1256
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,875
Randy, you wet fart
of a human turd,

1257
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:18,351
you ambushed Jack Stanton, and you're
gonna admit it or you're gonna die.

1258
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:22,195
Libby, you're crazy!
Certi-fuckin'-fiably! At last, a fact.

1259
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,759
Buddy, you'll go to jail too!

1260
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,638
I... I don't know
anything about this.

1261
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,757
He's shocked.
He had no idea.

1262
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,833
Now, Randy, you gonna
write this out in longhand?

1263
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,072
I don't know what you're
talkin' about. Enough.

1264
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,870
You know what?
I'm gonna blow your nuts off. Oh, shit!

1265
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,031
Yes, I'm a gay
lesbian woman.

1266
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:42,475
I do not mythologize
the male sexual organ.

1267
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:46,275
God!
Now, now, you tiny scumbag,

1268
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:47,589
I know you did it.

1269
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:50,240
You're on retainer
to the Flash. I know that.

1270
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,152
And you stupid
little shit!

1271
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:56,279
You couldn't just make do with the crap
Jack actually did. You had to embellish it.

1272
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,477
Mister, you're about
to become missus.

1273
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:02,713
Libby, come on. Don't! You have a
choice to make, and very quickly.

1274
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,635
Just how crazy is Libby?
And you're gonna have to do it now.

1275
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,871
One... two...

1276
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,589
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

1277
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,557
Okay! Okay! Okay!

1278
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,359
Very good. Very wise.

1279
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:22,594
Now, I want you to be eloquent in
this letter you're about to write...

1280
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,239
and guilt-ridden
about your jealousy and greed.

1281
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,198
You could not
live with yourself

1282
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,954
if you deprived the
American people of this man.

1283
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,709
Tonight an aide
of Governor Jack Stanton

1284
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,837
has asked to join us
in order to play a tape.

1285
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:39,393
I haven't heard this tape yet,
but my producer has.

1286
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:43,155
We'd like to thank her for letting
us go on with such short notice.

1287
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:44,875
Okay, here we go.

1288
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,874
Uh,
I can be there in 15 minutes.

1289
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,951
I could come up there, sugar.

1290
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,714
No, no, no. I can't wait.
I have to have it now, okay?

1291
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,874
Oh, entirely. I get hot
just thinkin' about it.

1292
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,873
Look at King.
Look at his face. Oh, my God.

1293
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,754
Now, that sounded like me.
It was you, Larry,

1294
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,311
asking the headwaiter at Cafe des
Artistes could he seat you right away...

1295
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,596
because you hadn't had
anything to eat since morning.

1296
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:13,150
Well, how'd... How did you...
We recorded it off your cell phone.

1297
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,430
Now I would like to read
a letter from the man

1298
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,750
who did the same thing
to Governor Stanton.

1299
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,549
"To whom it may concern,

1300
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,149
I am an employee
of the Flash.

1301
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:27,119
I admit taking innocent statements
of Governor Jack Stanton...

1302
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,840
off his cellular phone,
editing them...

1303
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,073
and paying Cashmere McLeod to pretend
she was having a conversation with him.

1304
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:37,232
I did this for my own gain
and advancement.

1305
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,991
I confess it now because I can
no longer live with the fear

1306
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,515
that I may deprive
the American people

1307
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,876
of a great man."

1308
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,075
And it's signed: "Randy
Culligan, Attorney at Law."

1309
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:53,198
Don't you think the media owes
Governor Stanton an apology?

1310
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:58,116
I mean, spreading this kind of
unsubstantiated garbage... Good, very good.

1311
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,669
It should be harder than this
to smear an innocent man.

1312
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,030
There you go, Daisy.

1313
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,033
We'll be right back with your phone calls.
Don't go away.

1314
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,554
How'd you get my cellular?

1315
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:12,390
Henry, well done. She was...

1316
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,515
She was so great!

1317
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,910
Still the one
that I wouldn't switch

1318
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,152
Still
the one that I wouldn't switch

1319
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:24,996
We're still having fun and you're
still the one There's people out there.

1320
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:30,029
You are
still the one that makes me shout

1321
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:33,312
Still the one
that I dream about

1322
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:37,792
We're still having fun
and you're still the one

1323
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:42,038
Whoo, whoo
Still the one

1324
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,316
Yeah, still the one

1325
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,471
I want to thank you all
for stickin' with us

1326
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:49,312
and workin' so hard
through all this.

1327
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:53,599
W-We don't have much time,
but with your help and the grace of God,

1328
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:56,752
we will get done what
needs to get done. Yes.

1329
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,990
You know, it's been
pretty awful, but...

1330
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:02,232
we're still here!

1331
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,349
Well, I know it would be easy
to get a lot of laughs tonight

1332
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,309
by doing some cheap blow-dry
jokes, so I'll just get started.

1333
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:22,152
It all started innocently
enough for Governor Stanton.

1334
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:26,313
He walked in one day and he asked
for a little trim.

1335
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,313
- And some longer bangs.
- Hmm.

1336
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,837
They don't care
about the fine points.

1337
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,916
No. It would ruin
the punch line.

1338
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:39,438
Does anyone ever survive
one of these feeding frenzies?

1339
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,830
Well, if they've been
around a while, maybe.

1340
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,399
But this is the first thing

1341
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,039
most people will hear
about Jack Stanton,

1342
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,918
and you've got to figure
he's history.

1343
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:51,389
Fuckin' idiot! God... damn...
her!

1344
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:57,795
O'er the land of the free

1345
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,719
And the home

1346
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:06,319
Of the brave

1347
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,354
Thank you, Phil.

1348
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,591
Folks, as the head of the
Portsmouth Democratic Party,

1349
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,840
it's my pleasure
to introduce to you

1350
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,913
one of the South's
most progressive governors,

1351
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,753
and the husband
of one of the best little

1352
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,751
fly-fishermen
to ever put on waders.

1353
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,389
Please welcome
Governor Jack Stanton!

1354
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:45,159
Thank you for that
kind introduction, Tommy,

1355
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:48,950
and, uh, thank you
for the fish.

1356
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:52,715
Yeah, he gave me a big
slab-sided, white-bellied fella.

1357
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,677
Looked a lot like me.

1358
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,638
Put it right on the grill
and gave it some heat,

1359
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,440
kinda like they're doing to me now too.

1360
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:02,234
I want... I want to thank you
for comin' out tonight.

1361
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,233
I know how hard you work and how
little time you have to rest.

1362
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,116
Some of us got more time than we'd like.

1363
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,635
Right. Right.
I understand.

1364
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,316
In fact, since this factory closed,
how many of you have found work?

1365
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,319
Let me see a show of hands.

1366
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,959
Right. Right.

1367
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,356
And how many of you work jobs
that just pay the rent

1368
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,999
no matter how many hours
you put in?

1369
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:28,029
I see. My mama worked jobs
like that after my daddy died.

1370
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:32,831
I remember her comin' home from work
just bone-weary. You know what I mean.

1371
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,470
And I... I know she wanted to play
with me and ask me about school.

1372
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,591
But sometimes you're just
too tired to do anything...

1373
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,956
but heat up a TV dinner and
blob out in front of the tube.

1374
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:44,158
- You got that one right.
- There you go.

1375
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:47,312
And I don't have to tell you how
hard it is to be lookin' for work.

1376
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,478
Hey, I don't have to tell you
anything about hard times.

1377
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,278
So you know
what I'm gonna do?

1378
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:55,956
I'm gonna do something really outrageous.
I'm gonna tell the truth.

1379
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:00,992
I know what you're thinkin'.

1380
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,476
You're thinkin' he must really
be desperate to do that,

1381
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,991
but if you had to swallow
enough sh... garbage...

1382
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,435
You can say shit.
We're X-rated.

1383
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,474
Yeah, me too, if you believe
what you read in the paper.

1384
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,516
Okay. All right.

1385
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,553
Here's the truth.

1386
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:27,756
No politician can
reopen this factory,

1387
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:31,515
or bring back the shipyard jobs
or make your union strong again.

1388
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:34,593
No politician can make it be
the way it used to be,

1389
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:38,390
because we're living in a new world
now, a world without economic borders.

1390
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,155
A guy can push a button in New York
and move a billion dollars to Tokyo.

1391
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,996
And in that world, muscle jobs
go where muscle labor is cheap,

1392
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:47,559
and that is not here.

1393
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,316
So if you want to compete, you're gonna
have to exercise a different set of muscles

1394
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,674
the one between your ears.

1395
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,312
He's lost 'em. Fuck 'em.
He's got me.

1396
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,755
Now, this whole country's gonna
have to go back to school.

1397
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,389
We're gonna have to get
smarter, learn new skills.

1398
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,035
And I will make you this deal:
I will work hard for you.

1399
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,952
I will wake up every morning
thinkin' about you.

1400
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:09,839
I will fight, sweat and bleed to
get the money to make education

1401
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,071
a lifetime thing
in this country,

1402
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,436
to give you the support
you need to move up.

1403
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:19,274
But you have got to do the
heavy lifting your own selves.

1404
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,789
Now, you know I've taken a
lot of hits in this campaign.

1405
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,680
But you know
what that means?

1406
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:27,195
It means someone thinks
that you're only interested

1407
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:30,079
in the kind of garbage that
they've been throwin' at me.

1408
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:34,109
So Tuesday, when you go to cast your
vote, you think about that.

1409
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,396
You think about what
you're really interested in,

1410
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,120
and then pick your candidate.

1411
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,510
Yeah!

1412
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,558
Thank you.

1413
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,598
I don't think I'll be able
to take it if he loses.

1414
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,192
If he does lose,
maybe we want to go away for a while.

1415
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:09,318
Try some non-campaign sex,
see if it holds up?

1416
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,834
Goddamn it, Richard.
Why are you always in my room?

1417
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,637
'Cause it's neater.

1418
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,715
Henry, when this is all over,
you and me ought to work together.

1419
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,713
Set up a consulting firm.
Tap that black Hotchkiss vote.

1420
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,997
Both of you, stop with the "when
this is over, we are pros" crap.

1421
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,674
Maybe you're pros, but I've
gotten emotionally involved.

1422
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,352
- Can I sleep here?
- No!

1423
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,393
All right. Shit.

1424
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,874
See, a pro knows
how to say good-bye.

1425
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,714
It's primary day in New Hampshire
where the polls are still open.

1426
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,189
Harris is a serious man and
has serious things to say

1427
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,918
about America's
economic future.

1428
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,638
People of this country
recognize that,

1429
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,996
and that's why we're
going to see upsets today.

1430
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,197
But the biggest upset has
got to be for Jack Stanton.

1431
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:06,035
Stanton, like George Romney,
Ed Muskie, Gary Hart before him,

1432
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,191
flamed for an instant
then burned out.

1433
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,953
He's just stirring
the ashes now.

1434
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:13,195
I can't understand
why we don't just quit.

1435
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,871
I mean, don't we know
we're over?

1436
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:20,120
An entire industry
of political experts

1437
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,675
has explained
why we're dead.

1438
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,990
Why are we still
walking around?

1439
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:28,670
The fact is Jack...
If it rains across the upper Midwest.

1440
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,874
And with 15%
of the vote in,

1441
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:36,039
we are predicting Lawrence
Harris to win in New Hampshire.

1442
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:39,989
Shit, that ain't nothin'.
It's his own state. He's gotta win here.

1443
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:43,912
Governor Jack Stanton,
who is still campaigning, by the way,

1444
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,599
has obviously decided to fight

1445
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:46,755
right down to the wire,

1446
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,475
and is in downtown Manchester
on this cold and rainy night,

1447
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,511
fighting to pick up
any last-minute votes.

1448
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:55,593
This has been his technique all
along, and many are surprised

1449
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,910
just how effective
it has been.

1450
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,834
According to exit polls, an overwhelming
number of Stanton voters say...

1451
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,311
the deciding factor for them was
that they actually met the governor.

1452
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,040
So we predict Governor
Jack Stanton a close second

1453
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:11,551
to Lawrence Harris, with Nilson and
Martin a distant third and fourth.

1454
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:15,429
I'll be a son of a bitch!
Don't be discouraged. We could still win!

1455
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,114
Are you crazy?
Didn't you hear?

1456
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:21,432
We're second. We're alive.
We're a fuckin' miracle, man.

1457
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,755
On the road again

1458
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,356
We have a chance now,
a real chance.

1459
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,312
If we could just
get rid of Harris.

1460
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,397
Harris'll probably
take Colorado.

1461
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:43,359
He could take Florida, too,
unless you start hitting him.

1462
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,751
I'll get Florida. It's the South.
But it's Jewish.

1463
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:49,309
You got to fire off a silver
bullet in Florida, Jack.

1464
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,517
Without Harris
we have the field.

1465
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:54,069
No. Negative'll boomerang.
I know it. Huh?

1466
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,879
I'm not goin' negative.

1467
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:00,072
For president,
Jack Stanton or Lawrence Harris?

1468
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,596
I served my country in Korea,

1469
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:04,751
and my boy Jeff fought
in the Gulf War.

1470
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,230
Jack Stanton dodged

1471
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,549
the Vietnam draft,

1472
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:11,156
and used political connections to
cover up his antiwar arrest record.

1473
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,275
I believe in real solutions
and telling the truth.

1474
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,912
Jack Stanton believes in glib
answers to tough questions,

1475
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,230
about his country
and himself.

1476
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,119
I'm Lawrence Harris.

1477
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:25,033
I'll fight the tough fights.
I won't run away.

1478
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:27,353
It's a question of character.

1479
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:31,431
Paid for by the
Harris for President Committee.

1480
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,512
Okay, I'm gonna kill
the son of a bitch.

1481
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,830
- Yes!
- Yes!

1482
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,356
But though I think
he is a fine man,

1483
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,239
and I agree with him
about lowerin' the deficit,

1484
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,359
I do not agree with Senator Harris's
proposal to study a reduction,

1485
01:19:56,440 --> 01:20:00,274
even a freeze, in cost-of-living
adjustments for Social Security.

1486
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:04,630
And I also disagree with
Senator Harris about Medicare.

1487
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,675
There's one other area where Senator Harris
and I disagree, and that is the Middle East.

1488
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,669
When he was a member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee,

1489
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:19,789
my opponent cast many votes regarding the
security and future of the state of Israel.

1490
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,358
No! Wait, I agree with
many of his votes, but some...

1491
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,916
Well, I think it's important
to stand with our friends.

1492
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:30,550
And America has no better
friend than the state of Israel.

1493
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:34,116
Thank you.

1494
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,559
Well, we're up three points
and climbing. Thanks, God...

1495
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:44,995
so a meeting with the Rainbow Coalition
might just be...

1496
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:49,039
Uh, one second. Who is it?
William McCollister.

1497
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,792
Can I call you back?
Yeah, I'll just be five minutes.

1498
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:59,277
Ain't you rememberin' me,
Mr. Burton?

1499
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,831
Willie. The barbecue place.
Come on in.

1500
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:07,271
So, uh, what are you
doing here?

1501
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:12,116
Well, I figured it'd be easier to
talk face-to-face with a brother

1502
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:15,477
than to the gov, even though
he's like a brother.

1503
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,120
I, uh...

1504
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:21,673
I flew here 'cause my daughter
Loretta is with child,

1505
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:25,117
and she says Governor
Jack Stanton's the daddy.

1506
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,115
Right.

1507
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,950
Has he landed yet? Yeah.
He's in the men's room.

1508
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,676
Okay. Uh, is he alone?
What do you mean?

1509
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:43,469
Doesn't matter.

1510
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,474
Governor. Hey.
Well, we're in the lead.

1511
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,350
Uh, good, good.
Senator Harris is second.

1512
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,556
The undecided's
killin' everyone.

1513
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:58,638
Governor, Willie McCollister
came to see me last night.

1514
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,440
His daughter is pregnant and
she says you're the father.

1515
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,960
Who else knows?
Well, he says no one.

1516
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,475
What's he want?
I don't know.

1517
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,276
I just can't catch
a break, can I?

1518
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:25,511
All right. All right.
Is Willie still here?

1519
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,512
Uh, no, he went back
early this morning.

1520
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,274
Well, I can't leave
before the primary.

1521
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,078
If this gets out,
it'll kill us.

1522
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,469
You and Howard'll have to fly
back to Mammoth Falls tomorrow.

1523
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:37,435
We gotta talk to him.

1524
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,478
We gotta make sure he understands
there's been some kind of mistake.

1525
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:44,837
They're good people but not sophisticated.
But I want 'em to know.

1526
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,599
Why pick me?

1527
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,834
Is it because I'm black? No.

1528
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,193
It's because
Willie picked you.

1529
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,114
You don't have to say anything.
Howard knows exactly what to say.

1530
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:59,835
But you should be there because
he came to you. All right.

1531
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,957
Governor,
if I'm gonna do this,

1532
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:04,071
then there's something
I need to know.

1533
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,074
I am not the father
of that child.

1534
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:12,594
Henry, you will never have to be
ashamed to be part of this campaign.

1535
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:16,514
You understand that? You never have to
swallow it, duck it or apologize for it.

1536
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,918
I'll make sure
that doesn't happen.

1537
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:23,192
Guys? Hmm?

1538
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,430
Hey, Mr. Burton.
Hi, Willie.

1539
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,190
Hey, Gov.

1540
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,073
You remember
Howard Ferguson.

1541
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,879
He works
with the governor too.

1542
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,637
Hello.
Mornin'.

1543
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,993
Well, what can I
do for ya?

1544
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,111
The governor
is very concerned

1545
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:06,840
about this situation
with your daughter.

1546
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,233
He'd like
to see it resolved.

1547
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,114
As I'm sure you would.

1548
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,711
He would like her to have an
amniocentesis as soon as possible

1549
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,394
so that paternity can be
positively established.

1550
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:25,157
A what? It's a medical procedure
performed in a hospital.

1551
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,630
A needle is inserted
into the abdomen.

1552
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,713
Amniotic fluid is drawn
from your daughter's womb.

1553
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:34,275
Genetic material is analyzed.
It can then be compared

1554
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,914
with the governor's blood to
determine whether he is the father.

1555
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,877
I don't understand.
It's normally used to determine

1556
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,119
the health of the fetus, and that's
what you'll tell them at Mercy Hospital.

1557
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:46,870
That you want to make sure
that the baby's healthy.

1558
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,000
It's a common
procedure, Willie.

1559
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:50,479
They put a needle
in her belly?

1560
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,278
Look, look, look.
Mr. McCollister.

1561
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,429
There are people who would like
to destroy Governor Stanton.

1562
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,749
He doesn't believe you're one of
them, but he can't allow this.

1563
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,315
You can't allow this.

1564
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,714
I'm sure your daughter's a fine
young person, but she's a child.

1565
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:07,153
Children are impressionable, and there's
been a lot of news about the governor...

1566
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:08,754
She ain't said a word
to anybody.

1567
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:10,877
I told her not to.
She's a good girl.

1568
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,390
Oh, I'm sure she is.

1569
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,113
And the governor wants to do
everything possible

1570
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,794
to help her, and you,
through this time.

1571
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:20,991
He is prepared to be
very generous.

1572
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,514
He will help her
provide for the baby.

1573
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:29,476
Now, he'll do this because he
believes that you are his friend.

1574
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:35,436
But we must resolve this.

1575
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,670
We must determine
to everyone's satisfaction

1576
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,910
that he is not
the father of that child.

1577
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,678
I'm sure that
you, uh...

1578
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,553
you know,
you understand...

1579
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:51,880
our position.

1580
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:00,675
Pull over.

1581
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,390
Pull over.

1582
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,112
Hello, folks.
I'm Izzy Rosenblatt,

1583
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:26,117
and I'm here
with Schmooze for Jews.

1584
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:29,519
And my guest today is
presidential nominee...

1585
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:32,234
and J.F.K. look-alike,
Governor Jack Stanton.

1586
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,073
Hi, Izzy.
Hi, Jack.

1587
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:38,472
Jack, when we were talking before, you
were telling me that your mama liked Vegas.

1588
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:41,672
As a tip to our listeners,
when she goes there, where does she stay?

1589
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,479
Which hotel?
Well, she's pretty loyal to the MGM Grand.

1590
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:47,400
MGM Grand. Listen up,
you Vegas fans.

1591
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:50,354
And, and who is her favorite act there?
Is it Wayne Newton?

1592
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:54,389
Absolutely. Everybody loves Wayne Newton.
He's marvelous.

1593
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:57,956
He was once a guest on this show.
That was many, many years ago.

1594
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:02,151
Now, to satisfy the
curiosity of our Vegas fans,

1595
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,838
when your mother plays blackjack,
where does she stand pat?

1596
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,878
Is it 16?
Well, she is a bit of a gambler.

1597
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:12,073
Uh, but sometimes she'll go up to 17.
Oh, my.

1598
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:17,077
Uh, excuse me, Governor, but I'm told
we have Senator Harris on the phone.

1599
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,797
- Uh, hello. This is indeed an honor.
- Thank you.

1600
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,232
We were just talking
with Governor Stanton

1601
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,152
about how his mother
loves Las Vegas.

1602
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:29,075
I was wondering, Senator, does your
mother have a favorite vacation spot?

1603
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:33,950
My mother's dead. Oh. I'm sorry.

1604
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:38,477
Jack Stanton should be ashamed of the way
he's scaring other elderly people down here.

1605
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,279
You mean about going up to 17?
What?

1606
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,160
I'm not following you.

1607
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:46,039
He's telling people I'm going to
cut their Social Security and...

1608
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:48,876
It's, uh... Come on, Larry.
It's part of your book.

1609
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,679
Everyone knows what you're doing down
here, the sleazy politics you're playing!

1610
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,957
Is it okay if I get a word in here?
Go ahead. Be my guest.

1611
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:57,515
What am I saying?
You are my guest!

1612
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:02,637
Larry, I'm lookin' at your campaign
book here. Page 18, paragraph 3.

1613
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:07,756
What does it mean when you say you want to
study a freeze of cost-of-living adjustments?

1614
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,116
Ah. That's only
one possibility.

1615
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:13,352
Uh, we might want to rework
how they're calculated.

1616
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,431
I can tell you,
cost-of-living adjustments

1617
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,517
are calculated
to keep up with inflation.

1618
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,717
But I guess you don't think
that's such a good idea.

1619
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:22,952
Now, wait a minute! I didn't say that.
It's right here in your book.

1620
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:25,475
I... I said it has to be studied.
Who knows?

1621
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:29,110
We might even want to spend more
on cost-of-living adjustments.

1622
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,955
Tell me, Senator, who is
your favorite comedian?

1623
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,600
What? I'm tellin' the folks
what my positions are.

1624
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:36,710
You're the one here that...

1625
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,552
No, no, no. You're
distorting my positions.

1626
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:40,836
This is the reason no one
trusts the political process!

1627
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,359
You just can't defend
your positions.

1628
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:43,589
Not when you play these games.

1629
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:46,593
Ladies and gentlemen, we just can't
afford to keep spending money like this.

1630
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:48,751
You just said
you might want to spend more

1631
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:50,035
on cost-of-living adjustments.

1632
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:51,713
Larry,
I think you're confused.

1633
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:54,679
No, no, no, no.

1634
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,718
Excuse me. But, uh, now listen.

1635
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:02,518
Excuse me.

1636
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,830
What happened?
Did he hang up or... or what?

1637
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,078
Uh, yes. Yes, yes.

1638
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:11,438
Well, uh, so, tell me, Governor,
who's your favorite comedian?

1639
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:15,270
The phones haven't stopped ringing!
It was fantastic, a rout.

1640
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:18,239
We couldn't believe it when we
heard Harris on the phone, could we?

1641
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:21,392
No, no. We couldn't. He's fucked now.
We're gonna walk away with Florida.

1642
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:25,679
Quick! Turn on CNN.
Whoa, whoa. It's on. Shh.

1643
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:28,872
According to sources,
Senator Harris suffered two heart attacks,

1644
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:33,234
the first one immediately after a
phone call with Governor Jack Stanton

1645
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:35,038
during a Florida
radio talk show.

1646
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:39,396
Jesus. Oh, shit.
We heard him having it.

1647
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:43,235
...he remains in a coma.
His condition is listed as critical.

1648
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:48,076
Hospital sources in Florida will not confirm
the senator's condition at this point.

1649
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:52,520
It's difficult to say exactly what
effect this will have on the campaign.

1650
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:56,551
We don't know the damage to
Senator Harris's heart muscle yet.

1651
01:29:56,720 --> 01:30:01,157
His doctors have only issued general
bulletins regarding his condition.

1652
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:03,277
Because after such a massive
heart attack...

1653
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:05,551
The vote's in two days.
What do we do?

1654
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,556
We go back to Mammoth Falls, and Daisy
stays and pulls the negative ads.

1655
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:13,117
Jack, I understand how you feel.
But couldn't we respect...

1656
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:15,357
We go back to Mammoth Falls.

1657
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:18,274
There's a long history
of plaque buildup in the arteries.

1658
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:20,720
In the case of
Senator Harris...

1659
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:28,676
I was so
prideful, so fuckin' smug.

1660
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:30,997
There was no way
you could know this.

1661
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,753
We were gonna
whip his butt.

1662
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,672
I could have been gracious.
It would have been smarter.

1663
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:37,878
Well, I'm sorry. The man cuts
a vicious negative ad,

1664
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,678
then he ambushes you
in a talk show

1665
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:41,353
and he accuses you
of sleazy politics.

1666
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:44,552
You're supposed to be gracious?
Wha... Am I missing something here?

1667
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:46,677
Is Jackie okay?
Yeah, he's fine. Go ahead.

1668
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,791
This is no time to stop
the meeting.

1669
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,516
Harris is a smart man, and he's right
about the damn issues. He's right.

1670
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,837
He's a pompous son of a bitch.
He rubbed your nose in it.

1671
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,958
And I rubbed his nose right back in it,
but that's not how you win the big ones.

1672
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:02,917
All right. I don't know
what I'm gonna do now.

1673
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,231
I guess I have to fly back
tonight, address the victory party,

1674
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:11,231
try to get Mrs. Harris on the
phone at the hospital again.

1675
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:15,434
She hasn't been returning my phone
calls, but, uh, can't blame her, can ya?

1676
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:18,114
Ah. What do you think?

1677
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:23,634
Henry.

1678
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:28,239
What the fuck was that in there?
Who were you and Howard starin' at?

1679
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,153
Nothing. No one. Bullshit.
That wasn't nothin'.

1680
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:32,719
Who was
that woman with Susan?

1681
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,077
It looked like what's-her-name,
Fat Willie's wife.

1682
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,198
Why is she worth
starin' at?

1683
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:42,911
Henry, what the fuck is goin' on here?
Nothing.

1684
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,678
Party atmosphere...

1685
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,512
...after this win
here in Florida.

1686
01:31:56,680 --> 01:32:00,275
Yeah. All right. All right.

1687
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:05,754
You son of a bitch!

1688
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,958
Amniocentesis...
You motherfucker!

1689
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:14,554
Susan, I... I'm sorry...
When were you gonna tell me?

1690
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:22,351
My wife could
not be with me at this time.

1691
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:25,273
She's with our son Jackie at
Mammoth Falls... Susan, I'm...

1692
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:26,998
I want to extend
my sympathy...

1693
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,390
Come on, come on.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1694
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,557
A terrible thing has happened to
a good man.

1695
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:35,110
But Larry Harris is a fighter...
Shh, shh, shh. I'm sorry.

1696
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:39,279
With God's help he will rise to fight
again, a worthy and honorable opponent.

1697
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:42,030
And I know every one of us
throughout this great country...

1698
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,679
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1699
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:47,917
...wishes Senator Harris
a full and speedy recovery.

1700
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,991
I think
the people of Florida...

1701
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:55,074
will understand if I forego
any talk of victory or defeat

1702
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,709
and ask them to join me
in a prayer.

1703
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,958
We'll need a
consultant in New York, Jack.

1704
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:01,189
Norman Asher's good.

1705
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,953
Where the fuck
is Henry? Daisy?

1706
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,156
I don't know.
I just flew in with you, remember?

1707
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:08,039
Brad, do we have the New York numbers?
You're at 22.

1708
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:11,351
And Harris is running
at 18%, comatose.

1709
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,439
Shit, Henry.

1710
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:17,712
I'm really sorry.
The governor would like your input on New York.

1711
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,359
How do you think they'll take
the thing with Harris?

1712
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:24,271
Well, obviously, Susan, first we
have to see if Harris is still in.

1713
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:27,159
That's not very helpful.
Lucille?

1714
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:30,676
If Harris is out and Ozio
doesn't change his mind and jump in,

1715
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:33,117
I say the race is ours
by default.

1716
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,793
My God,
this poor woman.

1717
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:37,434
I want
to thank all of you...

1718
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:41,152
for your remarkable
outpouring of affection.

1719
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:44,439
It's obvious that my husband
will not be able

1720
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:46,955
to continue his campaign
for the presidency.

1721
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:50,158
Fantastic! I mean...
Well, you know what I mean.

1722
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:51,389
We have asked
our good friend

1723
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:56,879
former governor Fred Picker of
Florida to carry on for us.

1724
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:01,875
To continue to raise the
questions in a meaningful,

1725
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:03,954
honorable way.

1726
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:07,396
She's not too upset to give us a poke.
Give her a break.

1727
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:10,234
Her husband may be dying
and she thinks Jack did it.

1728
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:13,830
Now let me turn this campaign
over to Governor Picker.

1729
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:15,519
Thank you, darlin'.

1730
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,550
I hope you'll excuse me.
This is a rather emotional time.

1731
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:23,872
Mr... Governor Picker,
do you think you can win the nomination?

1732
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:27,033
Well I'm, uh, I'm not...

1733
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,270
out to win the nomination.

1734
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:31,237
I... I'm out to

1735
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:33,197
continue
what Senator Harris began.

1736
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:37,319
I'm trying to give the American
people an honest choice on the issues.

1737
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:38,999
But if you won
the nomination...

1738
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:42,039
Uh, it's really premature
to talk about that right now.

1739
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:45,070
I really haven't had
the time to think about it.

1740
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,311
Now, what I have thought about
is the best way I can help

1741
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:51,949
Senator Harris
in this campaign.

1742
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:56,637
And as I know him as a man
of action rather than words,

1743
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:01,155
the best action is
for me to go down

1744
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:02,999
and donate a pint of blood,

1745
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:05,757
because that's what
he really needs now.

1746
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:09,239
If you folks would like to
come down and donate a pint,

1747
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:11,357
I know Mrs. Harris
would certainly appreciate it.

1748
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:15,638
Jesus Christ, we should have
thought of that blood thing.

1749
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,949
Great.
Great goddamn move.

1750
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:23,394
How do we treat this guy? How do we
run against him if he's not gonna run?

1751
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,478
Oh, shit, he'll run.

1752
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,755
But till he announces it,

1753
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:28,672
he'll be
the flavor of the week.

1754
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:31,036
We'll just be patient
and wait till he comes out.

1755
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:35,236
What kind of changes
can we expect in the campaign?

1756
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:38,836
Lawrence Harris has made several
negative 30-second spots,

1757
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:41,873
and his pollsters
have advised even more.

1758
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:45,000
Will you keep going
in that direction? No.

1759
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:47,071
I won't be doing
any spots,

1760
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:50,756
and I won't be having any polls because
I'm not gonna be paying any pollsters.

1761
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:52,638
I'm not gonna hire folks

1762
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:55,280
to tell me what you're thinkin'
and how I can get at you.

1763
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:59,274
Then what exactly are you gonna do?
I'm gonna talk straight.

1764
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:01,910
Jesus Christ!
Who is this guy?

1765
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,798
Well,
let's not panic.

1766
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:05,234
He's as much as
admitted he's runnin',

1767
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:08,034
so now we're gonna see some
tarnish on the golden image.

1768
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:12,835
The media giveth and...
go fuck yourself.

1769
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:17,270
Governor, why did you
quit politics in 1978?

1770
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,072
Uh, there were a lot
of reasons, Charlie.

1771
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:22,277
Uh, I had personal problems.

1772
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:25,673
I know this can't be
easy for you to talk about.

1773
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:29,157
No, no, it's not,
but I guess...

1774
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:31,231
it's part of the game now,
so I'll be candid.

1775
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:34,599
You see, what happened was
I got too wrapped up

1776
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:36,637
in the business
of being governor,

1777
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:39,110
and I began
to neglect my family,

1778
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:41,556
and my wife fell in love
with another man.

1779
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:46,918
I quit in part to see if I could
salvage my marriage, but I couldn't.

1780
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:49,431
So I just wanted to make sure
that my boys...

1781
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,433
knew that they had two parents
that loved them very much.

1782
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:56,150
And I think if you ask them they'll
tell you that we made it through okay.

1783
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:00,954
They're in college now, and when Mrs.
Harris asked me to do this,

1784
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:03,191
they were very, very
enthusiastic.

1785
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:06,273
So I guess you could say that
I'm doing this for them too.

1786
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:09,000
Awesome.
Best I've ever seen.

1787
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:13,278
What do we do?
Well, now we panic.

1788
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,756
As I said earlier,
it must be very difficult...

1789
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:20,390
Hello.

1790
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:22,830
Hey, Amnio Man!

1791
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,514
God! How in the hell
did you find out?

1792
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:27,910
It wasn't hard.
Loretta talked to a schoolmate.

1793
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,231
A Current Affair just offered
the McCollisters 250,000,

1794
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,789
and Fat Willie threw 'em off the
property and threatened to call the cops.

1795
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:37,437
I had to stash 'em in another county.
I could fuckin' kill Jack.

1796
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,831
He says he's not the father.
Well, he's probably not.

1797
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:45,113
It doesn't matter. Shit begets shit.
Cashmere made anything possible.

1798
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:46,953
Yeah, didn't she?

1799
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:49,999
Listen, I'm a good consultant
and I know New York.

1800
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:54,074
But I'm not a magician. Those rumors
about you and the black girl...

1801
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:57,949
Norman, can't I tell 'em I gave
blood to disprove the charge,

1802
01:37:58,040 --> 01:37:59,314
and we're just waitin'
for the results?

1803
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:00,879
That's too defensive.

1804
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:02,280
I don't like the contrast

1805
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:04,277
between why you gave blood
and why Picker gave blood.

1806
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:07,398
I agree. But it might be a good
idea to get on some TV shows

1807
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:09,471
like Montel and Geraldo.

1808
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:12,553
You mean strip away those last
annoying little shreds of dignity

1809
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:14,591
and just wallow in trash?

1810
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:16,956
Why campaign in New York
at all? What is the use?

1811
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:19,475
You have to.
You can't skip New York.

1812
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:20,914
Well, they'll kill me.

1813
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:23,790
No. It'll just feel
like they have.

1814
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:28,199
But you'll survive.
We all find a way to survive.

1815
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:35,315
Th-That's why
I'm so, so happy to be in New York,

1816
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:38,120
to have the opportunity to...

1817
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:41,193
If, if you just
give me a chance...

1818
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:44,239
Please give me a chance...

1819
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,755
to answer your,
your questions...

1820
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,229
I love New York!

1821
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:00,720
I hope you rot in hell!

1822
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,313
Bugger, bugger, bugger!

1823
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:04,515
Son of a bitch!

1824
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:10,073
You're a phony! A pederast!
You're a sick hetero fuck!

1825
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:19,473
I'm in. I'm in.

1826
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:31,594
I don't know
how much more of this I can take.

1827
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:33,830
Okay, tomorrow we start
working Connecticut.

1828
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:37,231
Picker's speaking at a rally,
and we ought to hit it at the same time.

1829
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:41,154
He can't tomorrow. He's got to go to Brooklyn
and meet with the Lubavitcher Rebbe.

1830
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:43,709
What? Who the fuck
decided that?

1831
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:46,394
The Lubavitcher Rebbe.
Can't win New York without him.

1832
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:49,791
Hey, listen, Governor...
Norman knows New York. It's his call.

1833
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,630
Susan's right. You go to the rally.
I better keep the appointment.

1834
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:31,674
Thank you.

1835
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:40,712
Thank you. Well, this is
kind of overwhelming.

1836
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,435
He's nervous now.
He's the man now.

1837
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:52,157
I didn't expect this.

1838
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:59,078
To all the folks giving their blood
in the back out there in the tents,

1839
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:01,556
I want to thank them.
I really do.

1840
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:08,518
Would you all do me...
Would you all do me a favor?

1841
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:10,637
Just don't shout
quite so loud.

1842
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:14,031
Thank you.

1843
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:18,034
- Thanks. Now, I... I... I really mean it.
- We love you!

1844
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:21,750
I... I wish everyone would
just calm down a little.

1845
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:24,673
And when I say "everyone,"
I mean, uh, the press,

1846
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:28,116
and, uh, the TV crews
and all my colleagues...

1847
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:32,316
and all the folks who make a
living advising my colleagues.

1848
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:34,557
I think we need
to calm down some.

1849
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:41,710
You know, this is
a terrific country.

1850
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:44,520
But sometimes we go
a little crazy.

1851
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:49,356
And maybe that's part of our
greatness, part of our freedom.

1852
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:52,994
But if we don't watch out
and calm down,

1853
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:55,276
it all may just
spin out of control.

1854
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:01,354
You know, the world is getting
more and more complicated.

1855
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:06,789
And politicians have to explain
things to you in simpler terms

1856
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:11,832
so that they can get their little
oversimplified explanations

1857
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:14,149
on the evening news.

1858
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:18,120
And eventually,
instead of even trying to explain things,

1859
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:21,636
they just give up and start
slingin' mud at each other.

1860
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:25,197
And it's all to keep you
excited, keep you watchin',

1861
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:27,510
like you watch, uh,
a car wreck...

1862
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:30,752
or a, uh,
wrestlin' match.

1863
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:34,675
As a matter of fact, that's exactly
what it's like: professional wrestlin'.

1864
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:38,353
It's... It's staged
and it's fake,

1865
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:40,158
and it doesn't
mean anything.

1866
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:43,031
And that goes
for the debates.

1867
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:45,271
We don't... We don't
hate our opponents.

1868
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,238
Hell, half the time
we don't even know them.

1869
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:52,873
But it seems it's the only way we
know how to keep you all riled up.

1870
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:56,511
So what I want to do
with this campaign

1871
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:59,194
is kind of
quiet things down...

1872
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:01,835
and start having
a conversation...

1873
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:07,558
about what sort of country we want
this to be in the next century.

1874
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:13,878
And I want Governor Stanton to know
that I welcome him to this conversation.

1875
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,070
Well, okay.

1876
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:17,834
This show is all yours.
You gentlemen know the rules.

1877
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:20,520
No eye-gouging,
no chair-tossing.

1878
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:22,671
Three knockdowns,
I come in to stop the bout.

1879
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:26,789
I hope he don't lose it. Geraldo's gonna
go after him, and Picker's very smooth.

1880
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:29,759
He won't lose it. Frankly, folks,
he doesn't have anything to lose.

1881
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:32,833
...overshadows
your entire campaign.

1882
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,594
Is there any truth,
any truth whatsoever, sir,

1883
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:40,311
to the awful allegation that you are
the father of a child by a teenage girl?

1884
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:43,559
Oh, shit! No, it's good.
It's out there.

1885
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:45,950
Now, if Jack just keeps
the answer short...

1886
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:48,270
...that she's been
influenced by all the publicity...

1887
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:50,192
surrounding the phony
Cashmere McLeod tapes.

1888
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:53,113
Now, the family involved are good people.
They're friends of mine.

1889
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:56,551
I spoke with the father just before
they went to an undisclosed location,

1890
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:59,196
and he apologized for
causing me so much trouble.

1891
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:02,477
I think that's all we need to know, Jack.
Don't you, folks?

1892
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:05,111
Jesus Christ.

1893
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:07,396
Picker actually saved him.
I've never seen that before.

1894
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:10,433
That's incredible.
Maybe this is the first time.

1895
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:12,471
Maybe Picker's an original,
the real thing.

1896
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:16,949
You know your problem, Hotchkiss?
It's you got gallopin' T.B.

1897
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:20,836
You don't mean tuberculosis, right?
I mean true-believer-ism.

1898
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:23,191
You talk like a pro,
you act like a pro,

1899
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:25,471
but inside,
you're just like Libby,

1900
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:28,473
who actually goes crazy when her
candidate turns out not to be

1901
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,756
the rock her church
was built on.

1902
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:33,351
Do you know in '78 she actually
wore a button that said,

1903
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:34,669
"I'm a Picker Person"...

1904
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,310
and nose-dived when
he quit the race?

1905
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:40,798
Didn't even try to get the goods on
why he was... Well, he told us why.

1906
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:45,232
What? He wanted
to stay home with his kids?

1907
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:48,478
"I'd rather be dad than
president?" Gimme a fuckin' break.

1908
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:53,350
The race among Democratic
contenders might be a toss-up.

1909
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:57,639
Polls taken after the two men
appeared on the Geraldo show indicate

1910
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:00,639
that Governor Picker still has
a substantial lead,

1911
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:04,879
but there has been a remarkable
five-percent increase for Governor Stanton.

1912
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:06,675
Fuckin' Norman Asher.

1913
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,360
...Stanton's
appearance is attributed by many...

1914
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:10,869
Thank you.

1915
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:15,356
Hey,
I'm just takin' a leave of absence.

1916
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,954
I can't stick around and take
orders from Norman Asher.

1917
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:20,392
We're from different parts
of the jungle.

1918
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,314
Let him have his day.
This thing's about gone anyway.

1919
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:25,914
I can't believe this.
Why?

1920
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:29,029
Henry, I've been through
this shit a hundred times.

1921
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:32,472
That's what these guys do.
They love you, and they stop lovin' ya.

1922
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:34,672
But Stanton's different.

1923
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:38,189
Yeah, he is different.
He was worth it.

1924
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:41,916
You take care
of your ass, Hotchkiss.

1925
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,840
I'll see you
next time.

1926
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,913
I'm very sorry about
losing Daisy and Richard.

1927
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:04,270
But we're all pros.
We know these things happen.

1928
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:06,593
I wanna talk
about Picker,

1929
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:09,949
something Richard said
about Picker.

1930
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:12,119
I wanna find out...

1931
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:15,953
why did Picker quit
in '78?

1932
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:23,391
The only dirt I
ever heard about Picker...

1933
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:26,399
was a condo development
named Clearwater Estates

1934
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:30,155
where the state matched money for the
county to build a connecting road.

1935
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:32,150
And?

1936
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:34,639
Nothing specific.

1937
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:38,551
The project was being developed
by a guy named Edgardo Reyes.

1938
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:42,714
Edgardo Reyes is the brother
of Antonia Reyes, who is...

1939
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:45,992
Picker's former wife.
Who else knows about this?

1940
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:48,709
Anyone follow it up?
Nope.

1941
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:52,393
Well, Lib, let's go.

1942
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:55,870
What?

1943
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:01,996
- What?
- I'm tryin' to decide.

1944
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:06,313
Decide what? Whether I wanna do
this for ya, you stupid shit.

1945
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:09,840
I bust dust. I protect ya.
I don't do in the opponent.

1946
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:12,237
What the fuck
is the difference?

1947
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,591
All the difference
in the world.

1948
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:16,398
All the moral difference
in the world.

1949
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:19,992
I'm not too interested in
tearin' ol' Freddy Picker down.

1950
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:23,596
And if he's bent, if he's a crook?
It'll out.

1951
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:27,640
But when? Say he wins the
nomination, and then it comes out.

1952
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:30,354
Look at this.
Look at this.

1953
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:35,589
The results of the blood test
Dr. Beauregard gave me.

1954
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:37,914
Congratulations.

1955
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:41,233
- I'm sure this'll help.
- But it won't.

1956
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:45,798
Libby, honey, you know it. It won't matter
that my blood doesn't match Loretta's baby.

1957
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,310
It won't matter
that I can't be the father.

1958
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:51,235
The only way it would matter
is if I were the father,

1959
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:53,517
because guilty is
what's interesting.

1960
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:56,917
Am I supposed to live by these rules and
let Picker slide in on a special pass

1961
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:59,395
because you were a Picker
person in the 70's?

1962
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:02,717
You mean "and justice for all"?
That's a stupid fuckin' argument.

1963
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:07,073
Okay, but this isn't. Picker could
be guilty of fraud or a tax swindle.

1964
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:10,676
If he used influence to help his
brother-in-law, he's not fit to be president.

1965
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:13,517
He could be a real shit.

1966
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:18,475
Forget who you thought he was.
Find out who he really is.

1967
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:29,150
Get packed.

1968
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:35,551
We're in limbo now, Henry.

1969
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:40,871
We are outside
the mainstream.

1970
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:46,719
We are in purgatory.
We are lost.

1971
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:49,314
Libby,
if you don't shut up,

1972
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:51,949
I'm gonna kill myself.

1973
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:57,149
We are testing our
limits. We are in the pits.

1974
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:59,829
'Member Limbo Rock?
'Member the words?

1975
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:03,000
"How low can you go?"

1976
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:12,679
Is there a reason we're meeting him
in neo-Bwana Land instead of his office?

1977
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:15,150
Two reasons.
No recordin' devices.

1978
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:18,876
And I've always wanted to see this hotel.
Hmm. Yeah.

1979
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:20,914
Yes, I had this business.

1980
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,514
Yes, I hoped having the
governor as brother-in-law...

1981
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:24,749
would be an advantage.

1982
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:29,031
But Mr. Righteous
wouldn't cut me any slack.

1983
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:31,670
We did Clearwater
straight up.

1984
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:37,431
It would be God's little joke if they
nailed him for it anyway, wouldn't it?

1985
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:41,709
Freddy didn't know you hired his
wife and brother to get to him?

1986
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:44,794
Know? Absolutely not.

1987
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:47,997
Thank you, Mr. Reyes.

1988
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:51,152
My friend and I are very
grateful, more than we can say.

1989
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:54,312
Know? What the fuck
did he know?

1990
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:56,431
He was half-stoned
most of the time.

1991
01:49:57,680 --> 01:49:58,909
Stoned?

1992
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:04,556
Oh, dear. I really said
something I shouldn't, didn't I?

1993
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:06,831
Saint Freddy's staffers
don't like to hear that.

1994
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:09,833
Stoned how?

1995
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:13,434
Toot, toot,
tootsie good-bye

1996
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:19,078
You two look disappointed. You didn't
know he was a fucking maricon cokehead?

1997
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:22,869
Wait a minute. Coc...
Cocaine. He loved the shit.

1998
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:26,960
Hell, we all loved the shit, but he's the
only one who's a candidate for sainthood.

1999
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:29,913
I... I'm afraid that's
a little hard to buy.

2000
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,994
- I mean, it just doesn't fit.
- Maybe not now.

2001
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:38,597
Twenty years ago, almost everyone
was doing everything. Right, Libby?

2002
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:42,310
But where would Freddy score? How could he
keep it quiet in the governor's mansion?

2003
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:44,232
There was a guy.

2004
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,994
There was a young guy.
Lorenzo Delgado.

2005
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:51,717
Upper-class Cuban.
A lawyer.

2006
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:56,118
He and the governor knew each other
socially, so it was perfectly all right.

2007
01:50:57,720 --> 01:51:02,032
The joke is, Delgado just got
out of prison,

2008
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:04,873
and now lives in a
halfway house in Hialeah.

2009
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:07,474
And Saint Freddy is about
to be president.

2010
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:10,273
Yeah, that is a joke.

2011
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:13,194
Must get a lot of laughs when
you tell it at dinner parties.

2012
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:15,678
I don't talk about Freddy.

2013
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:19,157
I'm talking to you 'cause
you're from his campaign.

2014
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:21,480
It's just...

2015
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:25,474
I'm not the only guy
in town knows this.

2016
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:30,156
Ah, he should have never
gotten back into the game.

2017
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:32,358
Now he'll go down.

2018
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:37,270
This is America.
You can bank on it.

2019
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:47,555
Lorenzo Delgado.

2020
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:51,518
On the porch.
Through there.

2021
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:53,634
Thank you.

2022
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,038
Lorenzo?
Right in there.

2023
01:52:03,240 --> 01:52:04,230
Thanks.

2024
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:13,551
Mr. Delgado,
we're here about Freddy Picker.

2025
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:17,991
Sit down.
Sit down.

2026
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,673
Are you
from the campaign?

2027
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:25,794
I've been expecting you.

2028
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:29,874
You can tell Freddy he has
nothing to fear from me.

2029
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:31,878
Nothing.
Understand?

2030
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,991
This happened after him.

2031
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:41,551
I fucked my brains out
in jail.

2032
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:43,557
Not much else to do there.

2033
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:49,789
There were so many boys who spent all
day in the gym working on their bodies.

2034
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:01,551
I like this porch.

2035
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:05,393
I can't do it all the time.
It depends on the weather.

2036
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:08,872
It's strange.

2037
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:12,073
My body temperature is always
off one way or the other.

2038
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:13,998
Too hot or too cold.

2039
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:16,917
It's never just right.

2040
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:21,109
Sometimes the tiniest breeze
can set me off, shivering.

2041
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:26,751
There's nothing I can do about it.
I can't turn it off.

2042
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:30,071
I just gotta let it ride.

2043
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:38,310
So, are you
Freddy's friend now?

2044
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:49,190
You just knew
it was gonna be good.

2045
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:51,990
You just knew
it was gonna be irresistible.

2046
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:54,799
But this has every
fucking thing.

2047
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:57,634
Sex. Drugs.
Corruption.

2048
01:53:57,960 --> 01:54:00,031
And none of it,
none of it,

2049
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:02,760
Henry, my man,
is clear-cut venality.

2050
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:07,351
It's all kind of human
and awful and... sad.

2051
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:11,636
Now we'll find out.

2052
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:14,794
Find out what, Libby?
We just found out.

2053
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:18,555
Oh, don't play dumb with me, Henry.
This is a test.

2054
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:21,311
Of us and them.

2055
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:23,955
Actually, of us and them
and us again.

2056
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:26,356
We passed the entrance exam.
We got the dirt.

2057
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:29,040
Now it's about them,
Jack and Susan.

2058
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:30,918
What are they
gonna do with it?

2059
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,799
Little buddy, isn't that
what we're both after here?

2060
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:38,110
I mean, after 25 years,
I get to see what they're about.

2061
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,594
Not just hypothesize.
Not just hope.

2062
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:44,390
This is it.
Graduation day.

2063
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:46,991
They graduate or I do.

2064
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:51,071
Tell the truth, Henry.
Isn't that what you're really after too?

2065
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,230
Watch the
road, Libby, goddamn it.

2066
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:55,719
Isn't it?

2067
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:16,509
Here, Governor, feast your eyes.
You too, my lady.

2068
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:18,870
Henry, a transcript
of our tour.

2069
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:35,919
This is...
This is remarkable.

2070
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:42,713
How on earth did he think he
was gonna get away with this?

2071
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:49,189
Now, now, what do we do
with this?

2072
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:54,390
The Times? No, the Wall Street Journal.
More authoritative in a way.

2073
01:55:55,160 --> 01:55:58,994
Through an intermediary,
someone not associated with the campaign.

2074
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:03,879
I don't think so.

2075
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:08,231
What do you mean? I don't think
there's anything of use here.

2076
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:12,913
You gotta be kiddin'.

2077
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:15,390
It doesn't meet
my standards.

2078
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:17,149
What on earth do you mean?

2079
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:21,151
I mean, madame, Henry and I don't think
the use of this material is proper.

2080
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:25,799
We have a moral objection.
And I have a historical beef.

2081
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:27,310
Aw, come on, Libby.

2082
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:29,311
Why did you go out and get it
if you weren't gonna use it?

2083
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:31,996
'Cause Susan was right.
He could've been a real shit.

2084
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:34,350
I didn't think he would be, and he isn't.
But he could've been.

2085
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:36,829
But, Jackie, my dearest,
you're off the fuckin' point.

2086
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,435
The point is we don't do
this sort of thing.

2087
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:42,951
Oh, I'll be relentless bustin'
dust and guardin' your ass.

2088
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:45,959
I'd have even blown Randy
Culligan's weenie off for ya.

2089
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:49,312
Well, maybe I wouldn't have.
But this is something else.

2090
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:52,120
This is hurting someone else.
This sucks.

2091
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:54,670
You wanna know
why this sucks?

2092
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:56,633
Because you told me so.

2093
01:56:57,920 --> 01:56:59,877
'Member when, Jackie?

2094
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:01,998
Let me refresh your memory.

2095
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:15,757
Weren't they gorgeous, Henry?

2096
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:18,315
- Yeah, but look at you.
- You little shit.

2097
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:20,118
I told you I used
to have a waist.

2098
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:22,510
Libby... Hush up. Don't ruin it.

2099
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:26,674
Do you remember when this was?
You don't, do you?

2100
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:29,713
The Miami headquarters in '72.
Yeah.

2101
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:31,877
It was taken just
after the convention.

2102
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,313
I'll never forget
that convention.

2103
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:37,996
Libby, for christ sake, what are you doing?
What's the point?

2104
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:41,630
The point is Eagleton.
'Member, Jack?

2105
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:44,640
I must've known you,
what, two days then?

2106
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:48,071
We hear that McGovern
has chosen a vice president

2107
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:49,878
who had electric shock
treatments.

2108
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:52,790
For the first time
I considered the possibility

2109
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:55,394
we might lose
to that fuckbrain Nixon.

2110
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:59,793
I mean, before that,
I was absolutely convinced we would win.

2111
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:04,313
Can you imagine, Henry?
We were so fuckin' young.

2112
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:08,511
And this one...
He takes me out.

2113
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:12,510
We go to this little open-air Cuban joint.
'Member, Jack?

2114
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:15,553
I got my head in my hands.
Life has ended.

2115
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:19,469
I say, "They did it. The C.I.A.
It had to be the C.I.A."

2116
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:22,115
I couldn't believe that Tom
Eagleton would really be a nutcase.

2117
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:25,233
They had to have dragged him off
and drugged him and made him crazy.

2118
01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:28,677
It couldn't have been that McGovern
was a complete fucking amateur.

2119
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:33,795
No, they did dirty tricks. I said, "We gotta
get the same capability as the C.I.A."

2120
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:36,754
'Member, Jack?
"We gotta be able to do dirt too."

2121
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:40,915
You said, "No. Our job is
to end all that.

2122
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:43,351
Our job is
to make it clean.

2123
01:58:43,680 --> 01:58:46,513
Because if it's clean,
we win.

2124
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:50,595
Because our ideas
are better."

2125
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:54,117
You remember that,
Jack?

2126
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:57,398
That was a long time ago.

2127
01:58:58,040 --> 01:59:01,795
Libby, you said it yourself.
We were young.

2128
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:04,796
We didn't know
how the world worked.

2129
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:07,799
Now we know.

2130
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:12,429
We know that if we don't move on this
Picker situation, two things will happen:

2131
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:15,200
The first is, we're dead.
Everything we've worked for

2132
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:18,671
since Miami 25 years ago
dies, and fast.

2133
01:59:19,640 --> 01:59:22,871
The second thing that happens is someday
very soon, when the romance dies,

2134
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:25,474
when they've gotten sick of Freddie
Picker's quiet, righteous act,

2135
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:28,991
some enterprising journalist
will stumble onto this.

2136
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:33,393
If he doesn't, the Republicans will
lead him to it on their timetable.

2137
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:35,596
Next fall, it'll be
another Eagleton.

2138
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:39,552
It'll be our fault this time
for letting it happen.

2139
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:41,873
Your fault, Libby.

2140
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:45,038
Honey, you may be right.

2141
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:47,475
All of it may be right.

2142
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:51,350
But we can't do it because it just
ain't who we're supposed to be.

2143
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:54,479
Maybe we could leak part of
it, the Clearwater stuff.

2144
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:56,478
We know the Republicans
have that.

2145
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:59,320
You don't think they're gonna
have the rest any day now?

2146
01:59:59,480 --> 02:00:01,471
You think Reyes is only
gonna tell this story once?

2147
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:04,469
I'm sorry, Libby.
There's just no discussion.

2148
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:07,109
You're right.
None.

2149
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:10,759
Henry and me have decided
this dies here.

2150
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:12,599
I don't think so.

2151
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:20,154
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
but it does.

2152
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,593
And here's why.

2153
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:26,153
You know what this is?

2154
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:30,878
Test results on Jack's blood,
Uncle Charlie's blood taken over the years.

2155
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:35,318
This is the blood test report Jack
gave me that proves he's not the father

2156
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:36,674
of Loretta McCollister's baby.

2157
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:39,354
You know what, Jack?
It's not your blood.

2158
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:41,435
Isn't that a riot?

2159
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:46,111
The blood sample Dr. Beauregard
took was not from you.

2160
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:48,232
It was
from Uncle Charlie.

2161
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:50,751
You sent him to have his blood
tested in your place,

2162
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:53,354
because you know good old
Dr. Beauregard loves you and,

2163
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:55,630
"Wants to
teach those Yankees a lesson."

2164
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:58,520
He's not gonna love you enough
to lose his license, Jack.

2165
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:01,752
Once he knows I have proof,
he'll fold like a cheap accordion.

2166
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:05,238
I know that won't prove you are
the father of Loretta's baby.

2167
02:01:05,640 --> 02:01:07,358
In fact,
I think you're not.

2168
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:09,790
But it proves you thought
you might be.

2169
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:14,394
That proves you fucked her.
That will kill your chances.

2170
02:01:15,160 --> 02:01:16,594
You would do that.

2171
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:19,471
You would end
his political career.

2172
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:24,517
You see, Jack,
she hasn't even heard.

2173
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:29,394
She isn't even upset that you
fucked your 17-year-old baby-sitter.

2174
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:33,920
You know why?
It's never the cheat who goes to hell.

2175
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:36,270
It's always the one
who he cheated on.

2176
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:39,400
That's why you can still talk
in that tenderhearted voice

2177
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:41,153
about bein' in it
for the folks.

2178
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:45,713
And Susie here can only talk in that voice
from hell about your political career.

2179
02:01:46,280 --> 02:01:51,036
What kind of shit is that?
Excuse me, I forgot.

2180
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:55,757
It's the same old shit. It's the
shit no one ever calls you on ever.

2181
02:01:55,880 --> 02:01:59,271
Because you're so completely
fucking special.

2182
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:02,878
Because everyone
was always so proud of you.

2183
02:02:03,680 --> 02:02:06,274
Me too.
Me the worst.

2184
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:11,270
It just makes it
a whole lot easier for me.

2185
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:15,873
It's totally depressing.

2186
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:19,954
What have I been doing this for
my whole pathetic fucking life?

2187
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:24,638
So here's the deal:

2188
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:29,671
If you move on Freddy Picker, who I think
we all agree is a flawed but decent man,

2189
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:32,192
I move on you.

2190
02:02:34,040 --> 02:02:35,758
Yes.

2191
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:40,675
I will destroy this village
in order to save it.

2192
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:51,716
Henry, tomorrow we...

2193
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:08,437
Is that for me?

2194
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:10,153
No, darlin'.

2195
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:12,838
Where are we?

2196
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:16,073
We're just coming up to
my beautiful condo by the river.

2197
02:03:17,080 --> 02:03:20,357
Hey, do you wanna come in for some
coffee, booze, Diet Coke?

2198
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:23,036
Not tonight.

2199
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:26,876
Deliver this for me,
will ya?

2200
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:29,033
I'm not gonna use it.

2201
02:03:29,680 --> 02:03:33,071
You're giving them the blood test
info, letting them off the hook?

2202
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:37,672
Why not? Picker will go down anyway.
We can't save him.

2203
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:42,876
The whole point of this was to see
if they'd turn him in, and they will.

2204
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:45,634
They didn't even
fuckin' hesitate.

2205
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:50,514
So... that's that.

2206
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:55,198
Let 'em swing, Libby.
Let 'em sweat a little.

2207
02:03:55,440 --> 02:03:57,033
Oh, honey.

2208
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:01,711
You see that moon?

2209
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:06,117
That's me. It's beautiful, huh?

2210
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:08,873
But, Henry,

2211
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:12,671
it's only reflected light.

2212
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:14,632
It needs the sun.

2213
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:17,911
The Stantons are my sun.

2214
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:23,280
I lived my life drawing
light and warmth from them.

2215
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:27,353
Without them,
I'm bleak and cold

2216
02:04:27,600 --> 02:04:29,750
and airless
for eternity.

2217
02:04:34,840 --> 02:04:36,558
You be careful, Henry.

2218
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:39,631
You still have something
of an atmosphere.

2219
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:43,280
Find yourself
a life, okay?

2220
02:04:44,120 --> 02:04:45,519
Okay.

2221
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:47,918
Come here.

2222
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:55,550
Go on now.

2223
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:09,679
Try and get some sleep.
You can find your way from here?

2224
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:12,794
Oh, sure.

2225
02:05:13,120 --> 02:05:16,954
From here? There's only two
ways you can go from here.

2226
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,116
Bye, sweetie.
Good night.

2227
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:41,751
No! No. No.

2228
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:44,676
Oh, God, no.

2229
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:57,112
Hey, hey!
No, she's a friend of mine.

2230
02:05:57,280 --> 02:05:59,271
She's a close friend of mine.
Come on. Let me through.

2231
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:00,839
It's okay.

2232
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:04,118
It's all right.

2233
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:27,916
A lot of us here today
grew up with Libby Holden.

2234
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:30,233
She was our friend.

2235
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:31,595
She was our big sister.

2236
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:36,755
She bullied us.
She drove us crazy.

2237
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:40,437
Worst of all, she remembered
everything about us.

2238
02:06:41,560 --> 02:06:43,551
Everything we hoped to be.

2239
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,310
Everything we wanted
the world to be.

2240
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,037
All those young promises made,

2241
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:51,231
Libby remembered
in the original wording.

2242
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:55,875
Before she died,
she wrote me a note.

2243
02:06:56,920 --> 02:06:58,479
It said,

2244
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:02,117
"I am so fucking
disappointed in you.

2245
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:04,471
Shape up."

2246
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:08,755
I am so sorry
that I disappointed her.

2247
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:13,233
I am so sorry I can't look
at her and say

2248
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:16,157
that I will promise
to do better.

2249
02:07:17,240 --> 02:07:20,835
She lent us her courage
and her warmth...

2250
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:23,433
and her madness.

2251
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,479
She...

2252
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:29,914
She had
the most amazing heart.

2253
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:36,593
Long trip.

2254
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,877
No press
that I can see.

2255
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:43,278
Not yet.

2256
02:07:54,920 --> 02:07:56,638
Follow me, Governor.

2257
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:01,797
This is the only copy left.
I want you to have it

2258
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:04,633
because it might help to know
what someone else may find.

2259
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:07,793
I shouldn't have looked for it.
I'm really sorry.

2260
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:12,678
Fucking cocaine.

2261
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:17,629
You know, I was so successful
at everything I did.

2262
02:08:18,160 --> 02:08:21,630
In business, politics.
Hell, I could handle anything.

2263
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:23,993
Except cocaine.

2264
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:27,829
Only, I didn't know that
because of cocaine.

2265
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:32,076
That's really what fucked up my marriage.
It wasn't anything else.

2266
02:08:33,720 --> 02:08:35,154
And...

2267
02:08:37,320 --> 02:08:40,233
I did go to bed
with 'Renzo once or twice.

2268
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:44,153
Hell, it was
just a coke thing.

2269
02:08:44,240 --> 02:08:45,833
I could do anything,
so I did that too.

2270
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:51,670
I'm seeing
a really nice woman now.

2271
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:55,519
I suppose I have to tell her.

2272
02:08:57,400 --> 02:08:59,198
Hell of a price
to pay, isn't it?

2273
02:09:00,280 --> 02:09:02,396
Maybe no one
will find out.

2274
02:09:03,320 --> 02:09:05,880
You did... in a day.

2275
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:09,911
I should never have said yes
to Mrs. Harris,

2276
02:09:10,040 --> 02:09:13,032
but I liked what Harris was doing,
and I thought I'd give it a week.

2277
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:15,272
Then it...
It just took off.

2278
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:19,149
Once I did that blood thing...
That was great politics.

2279
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:22,160
Yeah. Amazing,
wasn't it?

2280
02:09:23,560 --> 02:09:25,836
Jack, I'd like to thank you
for coming here

2281
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:28,396
the honorable way
you have.

2282
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:31,034
I was wrong to stay in.

2283
02:09:31,120 --> 02:09:32,872
I just hope when I quit

2284
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:34,917
maybe they won't
hit it as hard.

2285
02:09:37,680 --> 02:09:39,159
My boys...

2286
02:09:41,480 --> 02:09:43,949
I really don't want them
to know about 'Renzo.

2287
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:47,671
But probably
the bottom line is...

2288
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:52,078
I'm gonna be a national joke.

2289
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:55,679
And I'm gonna have to
explain it all

2290
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:57,433
to my boys,
either way.

2291
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,196
Because no matter what I do...

2292
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:03,671
the press is still
gonna find out

2293
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:04,830
the rest of it,
aren't they?

2294
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:09,434
If they think it'll sell
one newspaper, yes.

2295
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:13,673
Oh, my God.

2296
02:10:22,640 --> 02:10:27,157
If there's anything I can do, anything
that can make it a little better...

2297
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:42,271
I can still
hear the soft summer wind

2298
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:44,996
In the live oak trees

2299
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:48,999
And those Williams boys

2300
02:10:49,120 --> 02:10:51,555
They still mean a lot
to me

2301
02:10:51,960 --> 02:10:53,871
Hank and Tennessee

2302
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:59,953
I guess we're all gonna be
what we're gonna be

2303
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:02,752
So what do you do

2304
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:05,520
With good ol' boys
like me

2305
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:07,034
You know,
I love that song.

2306
02:11:07,120 --> 02:11:08,793
The line about
the Williams boys.

2307
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:10,479
It's never just Hank.

2308
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:13,393
The picture ain't complete
without ol' Tennessee.

2309
02:11:16,480 --> 02:11:19,677
Governor, I'm resigning
from the campaign.

2310
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:26,437
I don't accept
your resignation.

2311
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:30,555
Look, I just don't feel
comfortable about this anymore.

2312
02:11:30,760 --> 02:11:32,876
About what?
This...

2313
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:35,238
This line of work.

2314
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:37,756
I spoke to Richard.
He's back on board.

2315
02:11:38,080 --> 02:11:39,957
I'm puttin' him in charge.
Campaign manager.

2316
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:41,953
Probably in the office now.

2317
02:11:42,160 --> 02:11:44,276
I'm bringing Daisy back
too, if she'll come.

2318
02:11:44,360 --> 02:11:47,478
That's not what this is about.
Then what is it?

2319
02:11:47,920 --> 02:11:49,672
Libby.
Ah.

2320
02:11:49,880 --> 02:11:51,518
Libby's test.
You flunked it.

2321
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:53,637
But just now
I passed it,

2322
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:55,916
so which grade do I get,
the high or the low?

2323
02:11:56,040 --> 02:11:57,314
If she hadn't died...

2324
02:11:57,400 --> 02:11:59,232
If she hadn't died,
I'd have leaked the file

2325
02:11:59,320 --> 02:12:00,879
to someone, and I'd have
felt bad about it.

2326
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:03,554
But you know what?
I would have been wrong not to do it.

2327
02:12:03,680 --> 02:12:06,718
What I did now, I did for
Libby, but it wasn't right.

2328
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:08,518
If Picker hadn't quit,
he'd have won the nomination,

2329
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:10,273
gone down and
taken the party with him.

2330
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:12,391
It was only a question of when.
And how.

2331
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:14,517
And who pushed him off
the cliff when he was falling.

2332
02:12:14,600 --> 02:12:15,999
Those are fine points,

2333
02:12:16,080 --> 02:12:19,960
"how many angels can you fit
on the head of a pin" points.

2334
02:12:20,040 --> 02:12:21,553
This is hardball.

2335
02:12:21,680 --> 02:12:24,240
You tellin' me you just discovered
that you don't have the stomach for it?

2336
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:27,713
I know you better than that.
We spent too much time together.

2337
02:12:28,480 --> 02:12:31,950
This is it, Henry.
This is the price you pay to lead.

2338
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:35,636
You don't think Abraham Lincoln was
a whore before he was a president?

2339
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:37,274
He had to tell his stories

2340
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:40,159
and smile his shit-eating,
back-country grin.

2341
02:12:40,280 --> 02:12:43,113
He did it so he would one day
have the opportunity

2342
02:12:43,240 --> 02:12:44,514
to stand in front
of the nation

2343
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:46,870
and appeal to "the better
angels of our nature."

2344
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:49,192
That's where
the bullshit stops.

2345
02:12:50,160 --> 02:12:51,275
That's what it's all about.

2346
02:12:51,400 --> 02:12:54,916
So we have the opportunity to make the
most of it, to do it the right way.

2347
02:12:55,080 --> 02:12:57,833
You know as well as I do
there are plenty

2348
02:12:57,920 --> 02:13:00,514
of people playing this game
that don't think that way.

2349
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:03,399
They're willing to sell their
souls, crawl through sewers,

2350
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:05,909
lie to people, divide them,
play on their worst fears,

2351
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,833
for nothing,
just for the prize.

2352
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:10,793
I don't care.

2353
02:13:12,840 --> 02:13:16,515
I'm sorry, but I'm not
comparing the players.

2354
02:13:17,280 --> 02:13:18,953
I don't like the game.

2355
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:23,916
I wanna work for something small.
Voter registration.

2356
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:27,040
After everyone's registered,
who will they vote for?

2357
02:13:27,320 --> 02:13:29,675
In the end, Henry,
who can do this better than me?

2358
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:31,592
Think about it.
Is there anyone out there

2359
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:33,677
with a chance to actually
win this election

2360
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:35,512
who'd do more for the
people than I would?

2361
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:38,116
Who'd even think about
the folks I care about?

2362
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:41,519
Oh, shit.

2363
02:13:41,600 --> 02:13:43,398
Aw, is that them?
So quick?

2364
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:47,110
That damn driver. I knew it.
All right.

2365
02:13:47,200 --> 02:13:49,669
We'll go talk
to them together. Come on.

2366
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:51,997
Ah, don't shake your head.

2367
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:54,876
We worked so hard together
to get here.

2368
02:13:55,280 --> 02:13:57,874
It's there for us now.
Right there.

2369
02:13:58,600 --> 02:14:00,591
We can do incredible things.

2370
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:03,716
We can change
this whole country.

2371
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:07,314
I'm gonna win this thing,

2372
02:14:07,400 --> 02:14:10,791
and when I do,
we're gonna make history.

2373
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:14,077
Look me in the eye and tell
me it's not gonna happen.

2374
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:16,834
Look me in the eye
and tell me

2375
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:17,955
you don't
wanna be part of it.

2376
02:14:20,120 --> 02:14:22,316
Jeez... Jesus, Henry.

2377
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:24,033
You want me to get down
on my knees?

2378
02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:27,870
I can't do without you.
Don't leave me now.

2379
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:31,914
You're still with me,
aren't you?

2380
02:14:32,640 --> 02:14:34,995
Say you are.
Say it. Say it.

2381
02:14:37,680 --> 02:14:39,478
Come on. Henry!

2382
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:42,559
This is ridiculous!
You gotta be with me!

2383
02:15:45,320 --> 02:15:47,391
Mr. President.

2384
02:15:58,200 --> 02:15:59,998
Now, don't break our hearts.

2385
02:16:02,840 --> 02:16:05,593
Mazel tov,
Mr. President.
