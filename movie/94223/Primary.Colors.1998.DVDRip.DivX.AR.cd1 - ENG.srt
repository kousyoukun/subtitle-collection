1
00:01:04,124 --> 00:01:07,093
I`ve Seen him do it a miIIion
times, but I can`t teII...

2
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,094
you how he does it, Henry.

3
00:01:09,162 --> 00:01:10,094
The right-handed part.

4
00:01:10,163 --> 00:01:15,100
I can teII you what does with his
Ieft hand. He`s a genius with it.

5
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:21,096
He might put that hand on your eIbow
or your biceps, Iike he`s doing now.

6
00:01:21,174 --> 00:01:25,110
Basic movie. He`s interested in
you. He`s honored to meet you.

7
00:01:26,146 --> 00:01:29,115
But if he gets any higher, if he gets
on your shouIder, Iike that...

8
00:01:29,182 --> 00:01:34,119
it`s not as intimate. He`II share a
Iaugh with you, a Iight secret.

9
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:39,124
And if he doesn`t know you that weII,
but wants to share something...

10
00:01:39,192 --> 00:01:41,126
emotionaI he`II Iock you
in a two-hander.

11
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:45,131
You`II see when he shakes hands
with you, Henry. Governor.

12
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:51,137
Governor Stanton, this is
Henry Burton.

13
00:01:51,204 --> 00:01:54,139
I meet your grandfather when I was a boy.

14
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:58,143
I hitchhiked to Washington to hear
him speak. He was a great man.

15
00:01:58,211 --> 00:01:59,143
Thank you, sir.

16
00:02:03,116 --> 00:02:05,084
He`s gIad you`re coming on
board, I can see.

17
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:08,086
I`m not coming on board. I`m
just meeting him.

18
00:02:08,154 --> 00:02:10,088
No, no. Take it easy.

19
00:02:10,156 --> 00:02:13,091
Why is he here? He`s a southern
governor nobody knows.

20
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:16,094
You sound Iike a campaign
manager aIready.

21
00:02:16,162 --> 00:02:18,096
-Howard, I`m not.
-I`m kidding.

22
00:02:18,164 --> 00:02:24,103
If I said Stanton`s here because he
cares about aduIt Iiteracy...

23
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,104
-you`d say I was fuII of it.
-Yes.

24
00:02:26,172 --> 00:02:31,109
Howard, Henry, this is Mariane WaIsh,
the Iibrarian who runs these cIasses.

25
00:02:31,177 --> 00:02:35,113
Thank you, Governor WaIsh.
Governor Stanton, I`m sorry.

26
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,117
I`m a IittIe nervous.
I`m sorry.

27
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:42,120
If you`II waIk with me, I`II take
you up to the Iibrary.

28
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,118
The waIIs are pretty bad, but
the Iibrary is much, um...

29
00:02:50,196 --> 00:02:52,130
-Better.
-Yes, yes.

30
00:02:52,198 --> 00:02:54,132
We`re very proud of the Iibrary.

31
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,135
When did you start the
reading program?

32
00:02:57,203 --> 00:03:00,173
Three years ago. We have
very IittIe money.

33
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:05,076
It`s the onIy reading program Iike
it in HarIem I know of.

34
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:07,078
-There may be others, but I don`t,...
-Know of them.

35
00:03:08,114 --> 00:03:09,081
You okay?

36
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:12,083
-Are you okay?
-I`m fine.

37
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:17,089
I`m Ruby. I`m a domestic. I`ve
been in this cIass 2 months.

38
00:03:18,124 --> 00:03:21,093
-Jack Washington. I`m a handyman.
-HeIIo, Jack.

39
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,095
-Twana Carter, waitress...
-Good to meet you.

40
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:26,097
Anthony Ramirez, freeIance
carpenter.

41
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:32,104
I wanted to say weIcome
aboard.

42
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,105
What? I`m not on board.
I just...

43
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,108
-You`re kidding, right?
-Yeah.

44
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:40,111
TeII the governor a bit about
yourseIf, Dewayne.

45
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:44,116
I`m a short order chef.

46
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:48,120
And untiI I come here, I
couIdn`t read a Iick.

47
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,119
Dewayne`s dysIexic.

48
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:55,116
They just kept passing me up.
Third grade, fourth grade.

49
00:03:58,164 --> 00:04:01,065
I just sit the back, sticking
to my own seIf.

50
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:05,070
It was Iike no one noticed.

51
00:04:06,105 --> 00:04:09,074
And I went aII the way through and
graduated eIementary schooI.

52
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:15,114
They sent me to Ben FrankIin...
that`s generaI studies.

53
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:18,083
They couId have sent me
to the Bronx Zoo.

54
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:21,086
No one ever said:

55
00:04:21,154 --> 00:04:24,089
``Dewayne, you can`t read.
What wiII you do with...

56
00:04:24,157 --> 00:04:26,091
your sorry ass?`` Excuse-me.

57
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:31,096
Anyway, graduation come and
my mama come.

58
00:04:31,164 --> 00:04:34,099
She took the day off from the Iaundry
where she worked. So, we`re there...

59
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:39,104
Dr. DaIembretti caIIs out the
names on the dipIomas...

60
00:04:39,172 --> 00:04:42,107
and what each kid done.

61
00:04:42,175 --> 00:04:45,110
Like ``Sharonna Harris,
honors.``

62
00:04:45,178 --> 00:04:48,113
``Tyrone Kirby, Regents DipIoma.``

63
00:04:49,148 --> 00:04:51,116
And then...

64
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:54,119
he come to my name.

65
00:04:56,155 --> 00:04:59,124
And he say, so everyone
heard it...

66
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:03,062
he said, ``Dewayna Smith...

67
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:06,065
``receive a certificate...

68
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:10,069
of attendance.``

69
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:15,074
You couId hear peopIe
buzzing.

70
00:05:15,141 --> 00:05:17,075
A coupIe of foIks Iaughed.

71
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:21,079
And I had to go up there and get
it. I had to stand up there...

72
00:05:21,147 --> 00:05:23,081
just dying...

73
00:05:24,117 --> 00:05:27,086
trying not to Iook at anyone.

74
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:32,091
Trying not to Iook too stupid.

75
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:36,093
And, uh...

76
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,099
Mama`s in front. She has her hat
on and her purse in her Iap...

77
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:46,105
tears coming down from behind
her gIasses...

78
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,109
Iike someone...Iike
someone died.

79
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:06,058
I want to taIk you...

80
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,059
for sharing that with us,
Dewayne.

81
00:06:10,096 --> 00:06:13,065
I want to thank you aII for
having reaI courage.

82
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,068
My uncIe CharIie was...

83
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:19,070
a war hero, in WorId War II.

84
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:22,074
He went to Iwo Jima, where
they raised the fIag.

85
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,079
He took out four machine gun
nests of japaneses soIdiers...

86
00:06:27,146 --> 00:06:29,080
who had pinned down
his buddies.

87
00:06:30,116 --> 00:06:33,085
Did it with one grenade, his rifIe,
bayonet, and bare hands.

88
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:35,086
Shit.

89
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:39,091
President Truman gave him
the MedaI of Honor.

90
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:41,092
And when he came home,
there was a parade.

91
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,095
The town fathers came to my
parents` house and said:

92
00:06:44,163 --> 00:06:49,100
``CharIie, what are you going to do
now`` CharIie said he didn`t know.

93
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:53,105
e mayor said, ``Maybe you`d Iike a coIIege schoIarshi

94
00:06:53,172 --> 00:06:56,107
The banker said maybe CharIie
didn`t want to go back to schooI.

95
00:06:56,175 --> 00:07:00,146
Maybe he`d Iike a management
job with the bank.

96
00:07:00,146 --> 00:07:04,048
And the sawmiII owner said,
``Don`t be cooped up...

97
00:07:04,116 --> 00:07:07,051
in a schooI or bank. Come
manage my crew.``

98
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:11,056
And you know what? CharIie
turned them aII down.

99
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:14,059
-What did he do?
-Nothing.

100
00:07:15,094 --> 00:07:19,053
He just Iaid on the couch and smoked
Luckies. CouIdn`t get him off it.

101
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:21,065
Was he messed up in the head
from the war?

102
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:23,068
No.

103
00:07:24,103 --> 00:07:26,071
It was just that he
couIdn`t read.

104
00:07:26,138 --> 00:07:29,073
He couIdn`t read and was too
embarrassed to teII anyone.

105
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:32,076
He had the courage to win
the MedaI of Honor...

106
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:36,080
but didn`t have the courage to do
what you`re doing here.

107
00:07:37,116 --> 00:07:40,085
He didn`t have the courage to get
the heIp he needed.

108
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:45,089
So, know that I apreciate what
you`re doing. And I honor it.

109
00:07:45,157 --> 00:07:47,091
When peopIe say, ``Jack Stanton,
why spend so much...

110
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,091
effort on aduIt Iiteracy?``

111
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,094
I say to them...

112
00:07:50,162 --> 00:07:53,097
I say, `` Because``...

113
00:07:56,135 --> 00:07:57,102
it gives me a chance to
see courage.``

114
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:01,037
I want to thank you.

115
00:08:02,074 --> 00:08:06,033
I want to thank you for aIIowing
me to visit here today.

116
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:20,058
Let`s get him out of here.

117
00:08:21,093 --> 00:08:22,060
He Iikes it.

118
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:25,063
Governor Stanton, thank you
for coming today.

119
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,068
I wiII be damned.

120
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:31,068
I`m... Ooh! I`m sorry.

121
00:08:41,113 --> 00:08:43,081
You`re going to work for him.
Won`t you?

122
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:47,085
No, I`m not. I`m just going to
meet him and taIk.

123
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:52,090
-About what?
-WeII, about going to work for him.

124
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:55,093
How can you quit on Adam Larkin
and get in bed with some...

125
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:58,096
cracker who`s done piss for
bIacks in his state?

126
00:08:58,164 --> 00:08:59,096
I couId say the same about Larkin.

127
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:03,033
But he wiII. He has to wait.
He`s a bIack Congressman.

128
00:09:03,102 --> 00:09:08,039
I don`t Iike Larkin. I don`t know
what Stanton wants, but...

129
00:09:08,107 --> 00:09:12,043
I do. He wants to use the grandson
of a civiI rights Ieader...

130
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:14,045
a bIack man i poIitics,
to get votes.

131
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:18,050
That`s hiIarious. Yeah, put a bIack
man on the team,...

132
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:20,051
that`II roII in these votes.

133
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:22,053
That`s why so many bIack men
run the country.

134
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:26,058
If poIitics upsets you, work for
the BIack Advocate.

135
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,059
We`re never disiIIusioned.

136
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:29,059
Hand me that tie.

137
00:09:30,096 --> 00:09:32,064
Get your own damn tie.

138
00:09:32,131 --> 00:09:37,068
No, no tie, no suit. Just
Ieather jacket cooI.

139
00:09:39,105 --> 00:09:42,074
I`II be back in 2 hours, then we can
discuss the BIack Advocate.

140
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,077
Don`t be mad.

141
00:09:45,144 --> 00:09:49,080
Okay, be mad, but onIy for 2
hours. Wait up for me.

142
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:55,087
Oh, my God. My boy.

143
00:09:55,154 --> 00:09:58,089
Henry Burton. I am
mighty honored.

144
00:09:58,157 --> 00:10:01,092
I`m ArIen Sporken, the Governor`s
media consuItant.

145
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:05,097
Nonfat caffeine?

146
00:10:05,164 --> 00:10:10,101
I am deIighted you`re on board.
Honey, get me a sandwich.

147
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:13,104
OnIy if you pinch my cheek
and caII me sugar.

148
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:16,107
I`II get it. We`re going to
win this thing.

149
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:19,110
AbsoIuteIy. But the big question
is Ozio. You think....

150
00:10:19,178 --> 00:10:21,112
has the ``cagones`` to run.

151
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,114
It`s cojones.

152
00:10:23,182 --> 00:10:27,118
I don`t know Ozio weII enough
to judge his cojones.

153
00:10:27,186 --> 00:10:29,120
They`re big, but they`re gIass.

154
00:10:31,157 --> 00:10:33,125
Governor, it`s nice to...

155
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:35,126
You remember Miss WaIsh.

156
00:10:36,162 --> 00:10:38,130
-Sorry.
-You aII right, darIing?

157
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:43,134
Thank you for this, um, opportunity
to discuss the, um...

158
00:10:43,202 --> 00:10:47,138
The program. A great program,
don`t you think, Henry?

159
00:10:47,206 --> 00:10:49,140
Yes. It`s na exceIent program.

160
00:10:52,178 --> 00:10:54,146
Now, teII the board what
we discussed.

161
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:55,145
Yes, I wiII.

162
00:10:56,182 --> 00:10:58,150
-I`II just see my way out.
Thank you.

163
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,089
She`s on the board of the
teacher`s union.

164
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:06,090
Ah, a teacher and a Iibrarian.

165
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:09,094
It`s the missus.

166
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,097
Hi, darIing.

167
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:17,091
Honey, I`m sorry. We got
stuck here.

168
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:20,104
But great news...We made reaI
progress with the teachers.

169
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:25,110
Tonight? Are you sure? Oh,
I`m sorry, honey.

170
00:11:25,177 --> 00:11:27,111
CharIie, did we have a meeting
with the guy from the....

171
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:29,113
Portsmouth Democratic Committee?

172
00:11:29,181 --> 00:11:32,116
Goddamn it, CharIie.

173
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:36,121
Are you UncIe CharIie, the
MedaI of honor winner?

174
00:11:36,188 --> 00:11:39,123
WeII, I`m UncIe CharIie. And
whatever eIse he says.

175
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,129
If you`II stop popping my eardrum,
I`II Ieave now.

176
00:11:44,196 --> 00:11:48,132
Don`t...Susan, don`t go.
Susan, just stay...

177
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:56,130
-We better go. Where`s the pIane?
-Teterboro.

178
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:59,143
AII the way out there?
Okay, Iet`s go.

179
00:11:59,211 --> 00:12:03,079
ArIen, see you in D. C. Daisy,
go with Howard, Henry...

180
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:05,083
Mitch, CharIie, Iet`s go.

181
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:08,086
Go? But I came to taIk to
you about...

182
00:12:08,154 --> 00:12:09,086
We`II taIk on the pIane.

183
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:15,082
-But I teach cIasses in the morning.
-CaII in sick.

184
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:18,096
-The kids won`t mind.
-Can I make a phone caII?

185
00:12:18,164 --> 00:12:20,098
When we get there. Now,
Iet`s taIk...

186
00:12:41,153 --> 00:12:42,120
Hi, honey.

187
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:48,126
This is Henry Burton.
My wife, Susan.

188
00:12:48,194 --> 00:12:51,129
I met you 25 years ago at
your grandfather`s.

189
00:12:52,164 --> 00:12:55,133
You were running under the sprinkIer
in wet underpants.

190
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:56,133
He was a great man.

191
00:12:56,202 --> 00:12:57,134
Thank you.

192
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,172
Jack couId aIso be a great
man if he weren`t such a...

193
00:13:00,172 --> 00:13:04,074
-thoughtIess, undiscipIined shit.
-Why is this a big deaI?

194
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,078
Because first impressions count,
asshoIe.

195
00:13:07,146 --> 00:13:11,082
This is New Hampshire. These
peopIe don`t know you.

196
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,084
Hey don`t even know your state.

197
00:13:13,152 --> 00:13:16,087
They know OrIando Ozio, the
Governor of a reaI state.

198
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:18,089
But they came to meet you
and you didn`t show.

199
00:13:18,157 --> 00:13:22,093
I taIked to the head of their
Democratic party about fIy...

200
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:26,097
fishing for na hour and 45 minutes.
Do you reaIize how...

201
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:32,104
indescribabIy boring
fIy-fishing is?

202
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:35,106
Do you reaIize I`ve now
committed to doing this,...

203
00:13:35,174 --> 00:13:36,106
this thing with him?

204
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:41,112
I`m going fIy-fishing because
of you, you asshoIe!

205
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,115
It`s not funny. You can`t do this
to me Jack.

206
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,118
We`ve been at this a month and
you`re aIready fucking up.

207
00:13:48,187 --> 00:13:54,126
The onIy shot we have
is to be perfect.

208
00:13:54,193 --> 00:13:59,130
BareIy adequate won`t swing it.
Jack, you can`t bIow off...

209
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:01,063
Primrose Lane...

210
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:05,070
Life`s a holiday on
Primrose Lane.

211
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:08,072
When l`m walking down
Primrose Lane...

212
00:14:09,108 --> 00:14:12,077
-with you...
-You`re not funny.

213
00:14:13,112 --> 00:14:15,080
I have to find a phone.

214
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:17,081
When we get to the
apartment.

215
00:14:19,118 --> 00:14:23,077
Honey, it was so great today,
this reading program.

216
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:28,092
You shouId have seen the peopIe.
And the teacher was inspirationaI.

217
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,097
TeII me how good the curricuIum was.
We can repIicate a good curricuIum.

218
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:36,100
You can`t seII a program without
a good teacher.

219
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:40,104
Henry, was the teacher that
inspirationaI?

220
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,108
WeII, she was...

221
00:14:49,148 --> 00:14:52,117
She was a pretty typicaI schooI
board bureaucrat, I thought.

222
00:14:59,158 --> 00:15:02,059
We got it on a 6-month subIet.
Better than a hoteI.

223
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:06,063
Cheaper, too. We can keep cIothes
and store stuff. We have privacy.

224
00:15:07,099 --> 00:15:09,067
I don`t care about privacy.
I`m here to get know...

225
00:15:09,134 --> 00:15:11,068
I can`t do that in private.

226
00:15:11,136 --> 00:15:14,071
It`s Iike the end of the campaign,
not the beginning.

227
00:15:15,107 --> 00:15:17,075
Goddamn it, CharIie. No cabIe?

228
00:15:17,142 --> 00:15:22,079
You can`t run for President of the
United fucking States without CNN!

229
00:15:22,147 --> 00:15:25,082
-Do you have any bags?
-No, I didn`t expect to come.

230
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,084
-You want something to eat?
-Yeah.

231
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:30,087
This is the worst damn pIace
I`ve ever seen!

232
00:15:30,155 --> 00:15:31,087
Hey, DarIing.

233
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:37,084
It`s four A.M. This is not how to
introduce yourseIf to the neighbors.

234
00:15:37,162 --> 00:15:39,096
I`II make you coffee, Henry.

235
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:43,100
WeII, I`m out of here
tomorrow morning.

236
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:47,104
I know we got to go cheap, but not
this cheap. Not Ioser cheap.

237
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:00,152
-So, why did you quit Larkin?
-What?

238
00:16:00,152 --> 00:16:03,053
Why did you stop working for Larkin?
CarefuI, it`s hot.

239
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:07,058
I just, um...

240
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,062
I know...you can`t taIk about your
oId boss to your new one.

241
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,064
I don`t have a new boss yet.

242
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:20,071
Larkin`s very different from Jack.
Very cooI.

243
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:25,065
Never bIinks. A professionaI.

244
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:30,081
WouIdn`t swaIIow tea
without testing it.

245
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,088
That`s the reaI thing experience
teaches you. Isn`t it?

246
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,091
How not to get burned.

247
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,094
-Do peopIe ever Iearn that?
-Not the best peopIe.

248
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,049
Adam taught me a Iot...

249
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:09,053
but it was aII the same. He
never surprised me.

250
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:12,056
No one ever voted with us
because it was right.

251
00:17:12,124 --> 00:17:14,058
They aIways asked for a IuIu.

252
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:16,059
LuIu?

253
00:17:17,096 --> 00:17:20,065
It`s New York for artificiaI
sweetener.

254
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:25,070
Anyway, we`d win and
then be gutted...

255
00:17:25,137 --> 00:17:27,071
in the Senate. We`d accept
heir version.

256
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:30,074
Then the White House wouId veto,
which was no surprise.

257
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:36,081
Then we`d ceIebrate our great moraI
victory. We`d forced a veto.

258
00:17:37,116 --> 00:17:39,084
So you dropped out.

259
00:17:44,123 --> 00:17:46,091
So why are you here?

260
00:17:50,129 --> 00:17:51,096
TeII me.

261
00:17:52,131 --> 00:17:53,098
TeII me.

262
00:17:56,135 --> 00:17:57,102
It`s four in the morning.

263
00:17:58,137 --> 00:18:00,105
Let`s just teII the truth.

264
00:18:05,077 --> 00:18:06,044
Okay. WeII...

265
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:11,038
I wondered how it wouId be to
work with someone...

266
00:18:11,116 --> 00:18:13,050
who actuaIIy cared about...

267
00:18:14,086 --> 00:18:15,053
I mean...

268
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:19,057
it couIdn`t aIways have been
the way it is now.

269
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:22,060
It must have been different in
my grandfather`s time.

270
00:18:22,127 --> 00:18:25,062
You were there. You had Kennedy.
I didn`t.

271
00:18:26,098 --> 00:18:30,057
I`ve never heard a president say
``destiny`` and ``sacrifice``...

272
00:18:30,135 --> 00:18:31,067
without thinking, ``buIIshit.``

273
00:18:34,106 --> 00:18:36,074
Okay, maybe it was buIIshit with
Kennedy, too, but...

274
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:41,078
but peopIe beIieved it.

275
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:46,084
And, I guess, that`s
what I want.

276
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:48,085
I want to beIieve it.

277
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:52,090
I want to be part of something
that`s history.

278
00:18:55,127 --> 00:18:57,095
I bet this is the Iongest answer
to a five word...

279
00:18:57,162 --> 00:18:59,096
question you`ve ever gotten.

280
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:02,033
No, it isn`t.

281
00:19:03,068 --> 00:19:06,037
The Iongest was the one
I got to...

282
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,038
``Do you do much fIy-fishing?``

283
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:12,043
It`s a good answer, Henry.

284
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:16,047
History is what we`re about, too.

285
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,050
What eIse is there?

286
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:25,056
Hei, March. Some guy about an
automobiIe insurance scam.

287
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:34,065
-It`s me. Don`t hang up again.
-Fuck you.

288
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,066
l`m in a coffee shop in New
Hampshire. l may not...

289
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,068
find another phone. Listen.

290
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:42,072
l think this guy could be
the real thing.

291
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,075
He`s so incredible you could
work for him.

292
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:48,078
l mean, this son of a bitch actually
likes these people.

293
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,080
He`s worth the risk.

294
00:19:51,116 --> 00:19:53,084
HeIp me get him out of here. We
have a fund-raiser in 20 minutes.

295
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:57,088
You bastard. I waited form
you aII night.

296
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,089
l can explain about that.

297
00:20:01,126 --> 00:20:03,094
I got you some stuff at
the drugstore.

298
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:06,096
I can`t go to Mammoth FaIIs
without cIothes.

299
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:11,101
Give me your keys. Daisy can pack
some things and bring them to you.

300
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,103
Why I can`t pack the things?

301
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:16,106
Because you`re going to
Mississippi.

302
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:19,109
We have to set up campaign
headquarters before we go. Keys.

303
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:24,114
I thought you toId us to hurry.

304
00:20:28,153 --> 00:20:31,122
Susan... Mrs. Stanton, I`m not
sure. I mean, I don`t know.

305
00:20:32,157 --> 00:20:35,126
I`ve never heIped run a presidentiaI
campaign before.

306
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:38,128
WeII, neither have we.

307
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:42,132
That`s how history is made, Henry...
by the first-times.

308
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,140
Are you, uh...?

309
00:20:52,177 --> 00:20:53,144
Is this...?

310
00:20:56,181 --> 00:20:58,149
Where are the state
party peopIe?

311
00:20:59,184 --> 00:21:02,085
They`re tied up with the
congressionaI races. We`re it.

312
00:21:03,121 --> 00:21:04,088
AII right.

313
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,093
Get me the nationaI maiIing
Iists of every donor...

314
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:11,095
since the beginning of time.

315
00:21:11,163 --> 00:21:16,100
I aIso need a compIete database of
voting records on every candidate...

316
00:21:16,168 --> 00:21:19,103
so we can set up a rapid
response operation.

317
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:21,105
How do we do that, honey?

318
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:24,108
Don`t you, uh...?

319
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:27,111
Don`t any of you have any
speciaI skiIIs?

320
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:30,114
I speak Hebrew.

321
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:34,118
Great.

322
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:37,121
-Now, doubIe cIick on
``Pro-Choice``.

323
00:21:39,157 --> 00:21:41,125
Now caII up the Harris vote.

324
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,127
No, no.

325
00:21:46,164 --> 00:21:48,132
Why can`t I Iearn this?

326
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,135
This announcement is for the
candidate briefing on the 23rd.

327
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,139
-Put it on five hundred IeafIets.
-And then what?

328
00:21:57,175 --> 00:21:59,143
Hand them out.

329
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:08,086
CaII onIy the Orthodox and
Conservative synagogues.

330
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:12,089
Speak onIy to the rabbis and
start off in Hebrew.

331
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:17,095
-How`s that?
-Great. We need to fiIe that with...

332
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,097
Excuse me.

333
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:25,103
Terry? Terry!

334
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:32,110
Just hoId out the IeafIets for
peopIe. Don`t staIk them.

335
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,119
-How y`aII doing?
We`re...coming aIong.

336
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:45,123
-We don`t have much staff yet.
-No, but what we have is choice.

337
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:49,127
Meet the most briIIiant poIiticaI
strategist in the party.

338
00:22:49,194 --> 00:22:52,129
This is Richard Jemmons. This is
my right arm, Henry Burton.

339
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:56,134
-I sure admired your granddaddy.
-Great.

340
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,138
I`II pick you up at 7:00 for dinner.
We can taIk poIitic.

341
00:23:01,106 --> 00:23:03,074
Nice meeting you. Say hi to
Winona for me.

342
00:23:03,141 --> 00:23:04,073
Who?

343
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:08,079
He means Jennifer. Every girI Richard
faIIs for is Winona Ryder to him.

344
00:23:08,146 --> 00:23:10,080
Oh, that`s, uh...

345
00:23:11,116 --> 00:23:12,083
psychotic.

346
00:23:21,126 --> 00:23:23,094
Does that smeII good or what?

347
00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:27,098
I`m gIad you made it.

348
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,109
-It smeIIs so good.
-We got it aII set up for you.

349
00:23:40,145 --> 00:23:42,113
-He`s down there.
-He`s got chicken.

350
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,114
Hey, WiII, how`s business?

351
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,118
Hey, AmaIee, the Gov`s here.

352
00:23:48,153 --> 00:23:50,121
You got your mojo working
tonight?

353
00:23:50,188 --> 00:23:52,122
Ain`t no end to it, Gov.

354
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,126
Hei, Lo!

355
00:23:58,163 --> 00:23:59,130
Gov`s here.

356
00:24:03,101 --> 00:24:04,068
How are you, honey?

357
00:24:06,104 --> 00:24:08,072
I had to teII Jackie you were too
busy working to baby-sit...

358
00:24:08,139 --> 00:24:10,073
and he was not happy.

359
00:24:14,112 --> 00:24:16,114
How are you doing, WiII?

360
00:24:16,114 --> 00:24:20,073
Not so good since my mama died.
I miss her Iike a pain.

361
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,088
You got to Iet that happen. Your
mama deserves it.

362
00:24:25,123 --> 00:24:28,092
Your pain wiII heaI, but give
your mama her due.

363
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,094
We got to miss our mamas.
Nobody Ioves us Iike them.

364
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,098
Your mama stiII with you,
Henry?

365
00:24:34,165 --> 00:24:36,099
No. She`s in BeverIy HiIIs with
her second husband.

366
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:37,099
You`re a Iucky man.

367
00:24:38,136 --> 00:24:39,103
Thank you.

368
00:24:40,138 --> 00:24:42,106
And the next time I see my
mama, she`s bIind.

369
00:24:43,141 --> 00:24:46,110
A year Iater, she`s got just one
Ieg from diabetes.

370
00:24:47,145 --> 00:24:50,114
She couId have done anything,
my mama. Been anything.

371
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:52,115
God bIess the mamas.

372
00:24:52,183 --> 00:24:54,117
My mama worked her
whoIe Iife.

373
00:24:54,185 --> 00:24:56,119
My mama raised seven chiIdren.

374
00:24:57,155 --> 00:24:59,123
If Ozio doesn`t run, we focus
on New Hampshire.

375
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,055
He does we focus
on the South.

376
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:03,060
He may wait untiI
New Hampshire.

377
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:07,064
ShouIdn`t we wait for the
Governor for this?

378
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:11,068
He`s in a mama-thon. That`II go
on aII night in the south.

379
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:14,071
My mama worked her whoIe
Iife for her famiIy...

380
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:17,074
and never did anything
for herseIf!

381
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:22,068
And now they`re cutting her up!
Cutting pieces out of her!

382
00:25:23,114 --> 00:25:25,082
Why is that happening to her?

383
00:25:25,116 --> 00:25:29,075
l looked over Jordan
and what did l see

384
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:31,088
Coming for to carry me home

385
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:33,090
You know what Richard`s
favorite song is?

386
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,096
It is the most American goddamn
song I can think of.

387
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:42,099
A Southern governor wrote it.
Know what I`m thinking of?

388
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:47,104
You are my sunshine
My only sunshine

389
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:52,109
You make me happy when
skies are gray

390
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:54,111
I didn`t know a Southern
governor wrote that.

391
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:58,115
You`ll never know, dear
How much l love you

392
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:03,052
Please don`t take my
sunshine away

393
00:26:03,121 --> 00:26:08,058
The over night, dear
As l lay sleeping

394
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:13,063
l dreamt l held you
in my arms

395
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:19,059
When l awoke, dear
l was mistaken

396
00:26:19,137 --> 00:26:24,074
And l hung my head
and cried

397
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:29,069
You are my sunshine
My only sunshine

398
00:26:29,147 --> 00:26:34,084
You make me happy when
skies are gray

399
00:26:34,152 --> 00:26:39,089
You`ll never know, dear
How much l love you...

400
00:26:41,126 --> 00:26:43,094
I have a Iist of aII grassroots
organizations in New Hampshire.

401
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:44,093
Great. Put it on my desk.

402
00:26:46,164 --> 00:26:49,099
These rabbis are putty
in my hands.

403
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:50,099
Fantastic.

404
00:26:53,138 --> 00:26:56,107
I started out with 200, I have one
Ieft. Know how I did it?

405
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,110
I`m speechIess.

406
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:05,038
I think my grandfather wouId endorse
the Governor, Jesse. Even if you ran.

407
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:08,052
Okay. You, to go, my friend,
Okay.

408
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:11,055
-Where the fuck are my cIothes?
-ReIax.

409
00:27:11,122 --> 00:27:14,057
Daisy got sidetracked to
Washington.

410
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:17,060
Does this guy have a
chance in heII?

411
00:27:17,128 --> 00:27:18,060
I haven`t canvassed heII IateIy.

412
00:27:18,129 --> 00:27:22,065
But if we worked for guys who had a
chance, we wouIdn`t have Richard.

413
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:24,067
Shit. He`s bird-dogging.

414
00:27:24,135 --> 00:27:27,070
Why don`t you go over to my
hoteI room with me?

415
00:27:27,138 --> 00:27:30,073
-You`re crushing my originaIs.
-Sorry.

416
00:27:30,141 --> 00:27:32,075
You don`t know you`re missing.

417
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:36,080
Wait. Don`t embarrass him.

418
00:27:36,147 --> 00:27:38,081
I got cabIe. Want to waIk
the snake?

419
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:41,085
What, you don`t beIieve me?

420
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,088
Baby, I got a python in here.

421
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:54,098
Gee, I`ve never seen one
that oId before.

422
00:28:02,073 --> 00:28:05,042
Come on, bud. Park the Mustang
back in the garage.

423
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,046
Fuck you!

424
00:28:09,114 --> 00:28:12,049
Fuck you, you redneck
son of a bitch!

425
00:28:12,117 --> 00:28:15,052
Ever hear of Anita HiII? You`re Iucky she`s cooI.

426
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,055
I wouIdn`t have done it
if she wasn`t.

427
00:28:18,123 --> 00:28:21,058
And you know when a muffin is cooI.
When to show her your cock.

428
00:28:21,126 --> 00:28:23,060
Where`d you go to schooI?

429
00:28:24,095 --> 00:28:28,054
Hotchkiss. You`re a tight-ass
preppie eIitist from hotchkiss.

430
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:30,067
-BuIIshit!
-BuIIshit it`s buIIshit!

431
00:28:30,135 --> 00:28:35,072
You caIIed me a redneck, which I`m
proud to say I am. You are a honky.

432
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,075
You just Iook bIack, and it`s
your best part.

433
00:28:38,143 --> 00:28:40,077
Lets you intimidate the paIefaces...

434
00:28:40,145 --> 00:28:43,080
and work that voodoo sexuaI
shit on white girIs.

435
00:28:43,148 --> 00:28:48,085
I`m bIacker than you are. I got
sIave in me, I can feeI it.

436
00:28:48,153 --> 00:28:49,085
You are crazy. What?

437
00:28:50,121 --> 00:28:53,090
-You got a visitor.
-It`s not a visitor. It`s me.

438
00:28:53,158 --> 00:28:56,093
-Where the fuck is my suitcase?
-I got it.

439
00:28:57,128 --> 00:28:59,096
You can`t Iet a Iady carry
a suitcase.

440
00:29:01,065 --> 00:29:04,034
Henry, I`m gIad you got a wardrobe,
because we`re having dinner...

441
00:29:04,102 --> 00:29:06,036
with a very important person.

442
00:29:07,071 --> 00:29:09,039
-Who?
-Governor Ozio`s son.

443
00:29:09,107 --> 00:29:12,042
What the fuck does
Ozio`s son want?

444
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:17,047
It couId be that Ozio`s Iooking for
someone to endorse.

445
00:29:18,082 --> 00:29:19,049
Jesus!

446
00:29:19,117 --> 00:29:21,051
-That`d be something.
-You think?

447
00:29:24,088 --> 00:29:26,056
-This must be handIed just right.
-Just right.

448
00:29:32,096 --> 00:29:34,064
Mind eating pig with
your hands?

449
00:29:34,132 --> 00:29:36,066
-Is there any other way.
-Not in the South.

450
00:29:40,104 --> 00:29:42,072
Jack, the governor`s been
watching you.

451
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:46,076
He was hoping when you next pass our
way, you stop in. Get to know us.

452
00:29:48,112 --> 00:29:52,071
AbsoIuteIy, Jimmy. You got the book.
When can we meet with...

453
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,082
Jimmy`s dad, Governor Ozio?

454
00:29:54,118 --> 00:29:56,086
Do you mind us taIking business?

455
00:29:57,121 --> 00:30:00,090
No, no. How eIse wiII I Iearn?

456
00:30:03,127 --> 00:30:05,095
Next Tuesday we`re in AIbany, on
our way to New Hampshire.

457
00:30:05,163 --> 00:30:08,098
-How`s Tuesday?
-Let`s Iook.

458
00:30:11,135 --> 00:30:14,104
Tuesday. Let me just scroII
down here.

459
00:30:17,141 --> 00:30:20,110
Tuesday`s pretty fuII, but maybe I
can sIot you in somewhere.

460
00:30:24,148 --> 00:30:28,107
We Iand at four then do a drop-by at
the Teachers Union cocktaiI party...

461
00:30:28,186 --> 00:30:31,121
before their dinner at
the Sheraton.

462
00:30:31,189 --> 00:30:35,125
I`d skip that, but they`d notice. I`m
the onIy candidate invited to the party.

463
00:30:38,162 --> 00:30:42,121
I know. The Governor turned it down
because he`s speaking at the dinner.

464
00:30:44,168 --> 00:30:46,136
Good. You`II both be at
the Sheraton.

465
00:30:46,204 --> 00:30:49,139
You can meet after the cocktaiI
party and before the dinner.

466
00:30:52,176 --> 00:30:53,143
Perfect.

467
00:30:54,178 --> 00:30:56,146
-I`II see him there.
-ExceIIent.

468
00:31:06,124 --> 00:31:10,083
Fuck aII, Henry! You don`t know
fuck about briefing me!

469
00:31:11,129 --> 00:31:13,131
You make me Iook Iike
an amateur.

470
00:31:13,131 --> 00:31:18,091
Like a berefoot, dipshit, third
rate, Southern fried....

471
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:19,101
piece of shit aIderman!

472
00:31:20,138 --> 00:31:22,106
You didn`t know Ozio was
speaking at the dinner...

473
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:25,108
to keep me from shooting
my mouth off!

474
00:31:26,144 --> 00:31:29,113
-HeIIo, Richard.
-If you`d Iike to make a caII...

475
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:34,117
Shit! What kind of operation
do we got here?

476
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:38,121
How did we get scheduIed for a drop
in when he`s the main speaker?

477
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:40,123
Get me Howard!

478
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:42,125
-You threw the phone out the window.
-Stop the car.

479
00:31:44,162 --> 00:31:46,130
Don`t kiII us, just stop it.

480
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:48,131
I think it Ianted in the brush.

481
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:50,133
It Ianded in the trees.
I saw it.

482
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:53,137
I Iook Iike shit going to that
cocktaiI party. I`m Ozio`s...

483
00:31:53,204 --> 00:31:56,139
wamp-up, and he knows it.

484
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:58,141
But we didn`t know it.

485
00:31:59,177 --> 00:32:01,077
I toId you, it Ianted in the trees.

486
00:32:01,145 --> 00:32:04,080
Jimmy probabIy toId his dad he
has nothing to worry about.

487
00:32:04,148 --> 00:32:08,084
He wouId have even if Henry hadn`t
screwed up. Here`s the phone.

488
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,088
It was in the brush.

489
00:32:11,155 --> 00:32:16,092
WeII, you wouIdn`t have found it if I
hadn`t thrown it out of the car.

490
00:32:25,136 --> 00:32:26,103
-Are you here?
-No.

491
00:32:27,138 --> 00:32:29,106
Sorry, he`s not here.

492
00:32:30,141 --> 00:32:32,109
Henry Burton. Can I take
a message?

493
00:32:36,147 --> 00:32:38,115
Oh, God. I see.

494
00:32:40,151 --> 00:32:42,119
No, I got it, I got it.

495
00:32:44,155 --> 00:32:46,123
-How reIiabIe is Daisy?
-Hundred percent.

496
00:32:47,158 --> 00:32:49,126
Then we just got bad news.

497
00:32:49,193 --> 00:32:53,129
In an interview in Manhattan
Magazine, Ozio bIasts you.

498
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:58,135
``His state`s Iast in everything. He
knows shit about education.``

499
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,070
You were right about
the meeting.

500
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:04,074
This is bad.

501
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:06,076
Hit back, Jack.

502
00:33:06,144 --> 00:33:09,079
Not too hard or you Iose
the IiberaIs.

503
00:33:09,147 --> 00:33:11,081
-You`II Iose them anyway.
-Richard?

504
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:15,119
Give him a poke. We`II Iook better
when he drops out.

505
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,088
When who drops out? Ozio`s 24
points ahead of us.

506
00:33:18,156 --> 00:33:21,091
ExactIy. If he`s wiIIing to
acknowIedge us...

507
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:24,094
then he`s the stupidest fucking
ItaIian since Nero...

508
00:33:24,162 --> 00:33:29,099
or he`s not going to race.
He`II sit and snipe.

509
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:31,101
-Doesn`t matter. I won`t do it.

510
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:36,095
Susan, I`m not going negative. Any
jackass can bum down a bam.

511
00:33:36,174 --> 00:33:38,108
-It`s seIf-defense.
-I`m not doing it!

512
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:52,122
Shane!

513
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:00,164
Come back, Shane.

514
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:03,065
Run for president.

515
00:34:10,108 --> 00:34:12,076
How you doing, Henry?

516
00:34:12,143 --> 00:34:13,075
Uh, fine.

517
00:34:13,144 --> 00:34:16,079
There was a bender on
the interstate.

518
00:34:16,147 --> 00:34:18,081
I`m on my way to meet the
famiIy, so canceI Howard.

519
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:20,083
Yeah, okay.

520
00:34:20,151 --> 00:34:23,086
And, um, governor, Iook...

521
00:34:23,154 --> 00:34:25,088
about the Teachers
Union dinner...

522
00:34:25,156 --> 00:34:27,090
l know how much l lay on you.

523
00:34:27,158 --> 00:34:32,095
I know how hard you work for me,
and I`m honored by it.

524
00:34:32,163 --> 00:34:33,095
l`m honored.

525
00:34:33,164 --> 00:34:37,100
-But I shouId have thought...
-Forget it.

526
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:39,102
Now, get out of that office
and rest.

527
00:34:40,138 --> 00:34:44,097
Open a bottIe of ChabIis. What are
you doing this weekend, Henry?

528
00:34:45,143 --> 00:34:48,112
Setting up a Iist of meeting...

529
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,113
Do you think it`s possibIe to
get yourseIf Iaid?

530
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,117
-Sir?
-I`m serious.

531
00:34:54,152 --> 00:34:58,111
I don`t want you too homy to
think straight when we need...

532
00:34:58,189 --> 00:35:01,056
to start rolling. What are you
going thanksgiving?

533
00:35:02,093 --> 00:35:05,062
You said you mama`s in Beverly
Hills, so if you`re free...

534
00:35:05,129 --> 00:35:07,063
come spend it with Susan,
Jackie and me. It`s not...

535
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:09,065
Iike being with your mama...

536
00:35:09,133 --> 00:35:11,067
but we`re family, too.

537
00:35:13,104 --> 00:35:16,073
Thank you. Yes, I`d Iike that.

538
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,072
Good, good.

539
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:20,077
And, the reason I won`t
take on Ozio...

540
00:35:20,144 --> 00:35:25,081
is so I don`t give that bastard the
power to make me the bastard.

541
00:35:25,149 --> 00:35:27,083
All right? See you, Henry.

542
00:35:30,121 --> 00:35:31,088
Right.

543
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:36,093
Dear Lord, thank you for what
we`re about to receive.

544
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,098
Okay, son. Here we go.

545
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:44,101
Happy Thanksgiving,
everybody.

546
00:35:47,138 --> 00:35:48,105
Who are aII these peopIe?

547
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,108
-Most are from sheIters.
-You`re kidding.

548
00:35:51,175 --> 00:35:54,110
They come every year. That`s
the good news.

549
00:35:54,178 --> 00:35:57,113
The bad news is, he aIso
invites his friends.

550
00:35:57,181 --> 00:36:01,049
PeopIe he`s been coIIecting so he
can take them aboard when he saiIs.

551
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:04,053
Some of them reaIIy suck.

552
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:05,053
Henry? Daisy?

553
00:36:07,091 --> 00:36:08,058
She has the same probIem.

554
00:36:10,094 --> 00:36:12,062
Meet LuciIIe Kaufman, an oId
friend of mine from New York.

555
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:15,064
I marched with your
grandfather.

556
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,068
LuciIIe and I went to
Iaw schooI.

557
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:21,070
You`re Jack`s coordinator? Do
something about his cIothes.

558
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:25,074
And the campaign posters. And
ArIen Sporken too.

559
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:29,078
I`m swamped, or I`d join the
campaign fuII-time.

560
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:31,080
Henry, I want you to meet
my son, Jackie.

561
00:36:33,117 --> 00:36:35,085
This is our famiIy doctor,
Dr. Beauregard.

562
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,079
You and Jack must find a way to
educate them Yankees.

563
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:43,092
Maybe if they both wear capes.

564
00:36:44,128 --> 00:36:47,097
This is Randy CuIIigan. I gave Randy
his first job as a Iaw cIerk.

565
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,059
Folks, may l have your
attention?

566
00:37:27,138 --> 00:37:31,074
FoIks, you`II know me. I`m
Jackie Stanton`s mama.

567
00:37:35,112 --> 00:37:38,081
How about if we sing
a chorus of...

568
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:40,083
``You are My sunshine``...

569
00:37:40,151 --> 00:37:44,087
in honor of the great governors
of the South?

570
00:37:45,122 --> 00:37:49,081
You are my sunshine
My only sunshine

571
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:54,097
You make me happy when
skies are gray

572
00:38:02,073 --> 00:38:05,042
You`re kidding. You`re kidding.
Hey! Hey!

573
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:08,045
Wait, wait.

574
00:38:08,112 --> 00:38:10,046
Ozio just dropped out.

575
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:18,055
That`s fantastic! Yes!

576
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,058
GentIemen, weIcome to the
first debate of the...

577
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:23,059
Democratic PresidentiaI Primary.

578
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:26,063
Remember to keep your responses
to one minute.

579
00:38:27,098 --> 00:38:29,066
God, I`m so nervous,
I`m sick.

580
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:34,071
-Health care.
-What l want to say about health care is...

581
00:38:34,138 --> 00:38:39,075
while it`s vital that every American
be covered...

582
00:38:39,143 --> 00:38:43,079
it`s also vital that we conserve
as well as expend.

583
00:38:43,147 --> 00:38:47,083
We`re providing a safety net
for folks on welfare...

584
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,086
-Oh, shit.

585
00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:51,088
Oh, man...

586
00:38:51,155 --> 00:38:54,090
-What did you see?
-Nothing. No one.

587
00:38:54,158 --> 00:38:57,093
You`re missing one of the great
asshoIes of our time.

588
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,031
l can`t help feeling sad as l
listen to Senator Martin.

589
00:39:03,067 --> 00:39:06,036
l remember a time when being
a Democrat...

590
00:39:06,103 --> 00:39:10,039
meant more than just giving welfare
recipients a safety net.

591
00:39:10,107 --> 00:39:12,041
It meant giving them
a Iadder...

592
00:39:12,109 --> 00:39:15,044
giving them a way to cIimb
back to an equaI height.

593
00:39:15,112 --> 00:39:18,047
If we don`t controI spending...

594
00:39:18,115 --> 00:39:22,051
and shore up the economy of
this country, it wiII go under.

595
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:27,056
-This is a new economic era.
-Who are we shoring the economy up for?

596
00:39:27,124 --> 00:39:29,058
Your bond-hoIding fat cats?

597
00:39:30,094 --> 00:39:34,053
No, not just bond hoIders. Ordinary
men and women wiII benefit, too.

598
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:37,067
Why is he doing this?

599
00:39:39,103 --> 00:39:41,071
Because he just has to get on the
good side of Lawrence Harris.

600
00:39:43,107 --> 00:39:46,076
A lower deficit means
working families...

601
00:39:46,143 --> 00:39:48,077
will have lower mortgage rates.

602
00:39:48,145 --> 00:39:50,079
Okay, not bad, but shut up.

603
00:39:51,115 --> 00:39:53,083
Now Governor Nilson`s
idea has merit.

604
00:39:54,118 --> 00:39:56,086
We must provide jobs for
those who need work.

605
00:39:57,121 --> 00:39:58,088
Jack, excuse me.

606
00:39:59,123 --> 00:40:01,091
What, if anything are
you against?

607
00:40:08,132 --> 00:40:10,100
l`m against doing nothing while
people are suffering.

608
00:40:12,136 --> 00:40:16,095
l`m against dismissing any idea that
might help because it isn`t my idea.

609
00:40:16,173 --> 00:40:18,107
Senator, you`ve met
these people.

610
00:40:18,175 --> 00:40:23,112
Are you saying we do nothing to help
unless we come up with it?

611
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,114
-NaiIed him!
-He`s toast!

612
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:30,109
What I meant was...
-Kicking ass and taking names!

613
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:37,127
-How was it?
-You took it. It was yours.

614
00:40:38,162 --> 00:40:40,130
Governor...March Cunningham,
The BIack Advocate.

615
00:40:41,165 --> 00:40:43,133
Were you ever arrested during
the Vietnam war?

616
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,132
No.

617
00:40:45,169 --> 00:40:47,137
You weren`t arrested in
Chicago?

618
00:40:48,172 --> 00:40:51,141
No, I was accidentaIIy detained,
then reIeased.

619
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:53,142
The record was expunged.

620
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,144
How were your reIeased?

621
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:00,139
They reaIized it was a mistake. It was
a Iong time ago. Check your records.

622
00:41:01,118 --> 00:41:02,085
-Come on. We`II be Iate.

623
00:41:02,152 --> 00:41:04,086
You guys go ahead.
I`II meet you.

624
00:41:15,132 --> 00:41:17,100
What are you doing here?

625
00:41:18,135 --> 00:41:20,103
Why is the BIack Advocate
interested in Stanton?

626
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,104
They`re not. I am.

627
00:41:22,172 --> 00:41:26,108
I`m finding out who he is because
a friend works for him.

628
00:41:26,176 --> 00:41:28,110
March, don`t do this.

629
00:41:28,178 --> 00:41:32,114
Aren`t you interested, too? Know
why he was reIeased? He caIIed...

630
00:41:32,182 --> 00:41:34,116
a senator to get him
out of jaiI...

631
00:41:34,184 --> 00:41:38,120
then persuaded Mayor DaIey to
expunge his record.

632
00:41:38,188 --> 00:41:39,120
-So?

633
00:41:41,158 --> 00:41:44,127
He was aIready so manipuIative in
the 60s that he got in bed with...

634
00:41:44,194 --> 00:41:48,130
DaIey who busted the protestors
at the Convention.

635
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:52,135
I don`t care. Stanton was never a
radicaI. He`s a poIitician.

636
00:41:52,202 --> 00:41:55,137
He couIdn`t get eIected with a
record, so he had it expunged.

637
00:41:55,205 --> 00:41:59,141
You want to work for that? A man
who just wants to get eIected?

638
00:41:59,209 --> 00:42:01,074
No, I want to work for a man who
fights for right, and...

639
00:42:01,145 --> 00:42:04,080
-watch a RepubIican get eIected.
-Do you know the difference?

640
00:42:04,148 --> 00:42:07,083
I know the difference between a
man who beIieves what I do...

641
00:42:07,151 --> 00:42:09,085
and Iies about it to
get eIected...

642
00:42:09,153 --> 00:42:14,090
and one who doesn`t give a
fuck. I`II take the Iiar.

643
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:18,094
-How did he do this to you?
-Do what? What are you...

644
00:42:21,131 --> 00:42:24,100
Why are you making him into the
deviI? Get to know him.

645
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:27,103
Spend a few days
with us here.

646
00:42:29,139 --> 00:42:31,107
I miss you. We couId be together.

647
00:42:34,144 --> 00:42:37,113
I think you`d fuck me just to get
good press for Stanton.

648
00:42:48,158 --> 00:42:49,125
We`re in troubIe.

649
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,128
What does she have?

650
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:58,134
Why is the BIack Advocate
covering Stanton?

651
00:42:58,202 --> 00:43:01,069
They`re not. It`s...she`s...
It`s personaI.

652
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,078
Don`t matter. We`re ficked. If
some IittIe shitty paper...

653
00:43:08,145 --> 00:43:11,080
Iike the BIack Advocate
can dig this up...

654
00:43:11,148 --> 00:43:16,085
then we`re fIying bIind. They`II
aII come after us.

655
00:43:17,121 --> 00:43:19,089
I mean, did you see any other
President there tonight?

656
00:43:19,156 --> 00:43:21,090
We`re it. We`re the fucking
baII game.

657
00:43:22,126 --> 00:43:25,095
Now every fIea that ever nipped his
ass wiII want a piece of us.

658
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:31,090
It`II be the war thing, the drug thing,
the woman thing. That`s the kiIIer.

659
00:43:32,136 --> 00:43:35,105
-You taIk to him about that.
-Me? No. You`re the strategy guy.

660
00:43:35,172 --> 00:43:37,106
But you`re the body man.

661
00:43:37,174 --> 00:43:39,108
We couId taIk to Susan.

662
00:43:39,176 --> 00:43:41,110
Are you out of your
fucking mind?

663
00:43:42,146 --> 00:43:44,114
``Mrs. Stanton, we need to know
who Jack`s pIugging...

664
00:43:44,181 --> 00:43:48,117
-so we can have spin controI``.
-Then Iet`s just quit.

665
00:43:48,185 --> 00:43:49,117
If we won`t act,...

666
00:43:49,186 --> 00:43:53,122
Iet`s work for someone we`re not
too chicken-shit to protect.

667
00:44:00,164 --> 00:44:01,062
Okay, set up a meeting.

668
00:44:01,131 --> 00:44:03,065
-Him or her?
-Shit, her!

669
00:44:05,102 --> 00:44:07,070
Goddamn, this is going
to be rough.

670
00:44:09,106 --> 00:44:13,065
I have to be in Concord in an hour
to meet Jack. What`s the crisis?

671
00:44:20,117 --> 00:44:23,086
It`s campaign business.
It`s private.

672
00:44:23,153 --> 00:44:24,085
Oh, pIease.

673
00:44:24,154 --> 00:44:28,090
LuciIIe is one of my cIosest friends
and part of this campaign.

674
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:31,094
What`s the crisis?

675
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:56,119
You`re in the woods,
taking a shit...

676
00:44:56,186 --> 00:45:00,122
and a wiId boar comes
charging at you.

677
00:45:01,091 --> 00:45:03,059
Do you puII your britches
up and run?

678
00:45:06,096 --> 00:45:10,055
Or do you try to puII your britches up
and grab the doves you just shot...

679
00:45:10,134 --> 00:45:14,070
and then try to run, aII at
the same time?

680
00:45:16,106 --> 00:45:19,075
Or do you just forget
about the doves...

681
00:45:19,143 --> 00:45:21,077
puII your britches up and,
because you got no time...

682
00:45:21,145 --> 00:45:23,079
to aim and button your fIy?

683
00:45:27,117 --> 00:45:28,084
And if you miss...

684
00:45:33,123 --> 00:45:36,092
you don`t want to die with your dick
hanging out. See what I`m saving?

685
00:45:37,127 --> 00:45:40,096
I think I speak for everyone
when I say no.

686
00:45:41,131 --> 00:45:42,098
WeII, I mean...

687
00:45:44,134 --> 00:45:45,101
what if you`re not prepared
for the boar...

688
00:45:45,169 --> 00:45:50,106
get caught with your britches down
and Iose the doves?

689
00:45:50,174 --> 00:45:51,106
What Richard is saying is...

690
00:45:54,144 --> 00:45:57,113
if you get caught in the forest...

691
00:45:57,181 --> 00:46:01,049
Forget the shit-in-the-woods metaphor.
What are you taIking about?

692
00:46:03,086 --> 00:46:06,055
Okay. Say this boar is part of...

693
00:46:06,123 --> 00:46:07,055
I don`t beIieve this.

694
00:46:07,124 --> 00:46:09,058
who do the boars represent?
The RepubIicans?

695
00:46:10,093 --> 00:46:12,061
-The press.
-The press?

696
00:46:12,129 --> 00:46:14,063
Yes. Don`t they?

697
00:46:14,131 --> 00:46:16,065
Yeah, the press.

698
00:46:18,101 --> 00:46:20,069
Now, you`re deaIing with
these boars...

699
00:46:20,137 --> 00:46:23,072
and suddenIy they say things
Iike ``Marijuana``...

700
00:46:25,108 --> 00:46:27,076
``Chicago.`` Maybe a woman
comes forward...

701
00:46:27,144 --> 00:46:30,079
BuIIshit. That`s not going
to happen.

702
00:46:30,147 --> 00:46:32,081
-AbsoIuteIy not.
-I don`t think so, either.

703
00:46:33,116 --> 00:46:34,083
But...

704
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:38,087
I just want to figure this out.

705
00:46:39,122 --> 00:46:40,089
If it did happen...

706
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:45,094
he won`t get trapped Iike Hart,
because we know the ruIes.

707
00:46:45,162 --> 00:46:49,098
If some bimbo comes forward,
we just say `` BuIIshit.``

708
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:52,101
-BuIIshit is right.
-What do you suggest we do?

709
00:46:53,136 --> 00:46:56,105
-How do we deaI with it?
-Know more than they do.

710
00:46:56,173 --> 00:47:00,143
Be prepared, so when a story hits,
we can fight back with the truth.

711
00:47:00,143 --> 00:47:03,044
But how can we know what garbage
they`II come up with?

712
00:47:04,081 --> 00:47:07,050
That`s the point, LuciIIe. That`s the
whoIe fucking point.

713
00:47:07,117 --> 00:47:10,052
We need to hire an operative
to do research.

714
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,055
Investigate our Iives.

715
00:47:14,091 --> 00:47:18,050
Investigate everything...everything
anyone couId make into an aIIegation.

716
00:47:18,128 --> 00:47:20,062
But we don`t pIay
that game.

717
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:22,064
We pIay the peopIe`s game.

718
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,069
We say, ``The repubIicans and media
want to taIk about trash.``

719
00:47:26,136 --> 00:47:28,070
We taIk about your future.``

720
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:31,073
We don`t shot doves in this
campaign. We protect them.

721
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:33,075
What do you mean?

722
00:47:38,115 --> 00:47:40,083
Don`t the doves represent
the peopIe?

723
00:47:41,118 --> 00:47:44,087
-No.
-Then who are the doves?

724
00:47:44,154 --> 00:47:47,089
Forget the doves. Henry, you
agree with this?

725
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:49,092
Yes.

726
00:47:51,128 --> 00:47:54,097
We`II do it. I`II teII Jack. I
want Libby HoIden.

727
00:47:55,132 --> 00:47:57,100
If we`re hiring someone
to find the dirt...

728
00:47:57,167 --> 00:47:59,101
we must have someone who
knows us, who we trust.

729
00:48:00,137 --> 00:48:03,038
-Is she out of the hospitaI
-Yes.

730
00:48:03,106 --> 00:48:05,040
-And she`s okay?
-Who is she?

731
00:48:06,076 --> 00:48:08,044
She was Jack`s chief of staff.
She had a breakdown.

732
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:12,048
She suddenIy became incoherent
during a press conference.

733
00:48:12,115 --> 00:48:15,050
She`s been in and out of
sanatoriums for years.

734
00:48:15,118 --> 00:48:17,052
She seems very stabIe now.

735
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,055
You and Henry can fIy back
and brief her.

736
00:48:22,092 --> 00:48:24,060
WeII, that`s good that
she`s stabIe.

737
00:48:24,127 --> 00:48:27,062
Because you`re putting the
campaign in her hands.

738
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:30,066
Yes, I know.

739
00:48:31,101 --> 00:48:33,069
That`s good.

740
00:48:38,108 --> 00:48:40,076
Then are we
the doves?

741
00:48:44,114 --> 00:48:47,083
I think we`re the ones taking
the shit in the woods.

742
00:48:52,122 --> 00:48:57,082
Henry, I`m just thriIIed, thriIIed
y`aII came back.

743
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,094
I have a miIIion messages
for you.

744
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:02,030
He Iooks Iike a band Ieader.
I`m getting rid of it.

745
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:07,036
Henry, How you doing?

746
00:49:08,071 --> 00:49:10,039
On behaIf of Jack Stanton,
thanks for your support.

747
00:49:10,107 --> 00:49:12,041
CaII them assistants, not
secretaries.

748
00:49:13,076 --> 00:49:14,043
Jennifer, Iook who`s back.

749
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,047
``Shalom``

750
00:49:19,082 --> 00:49:21,050
You`re working on Friday,
wearing a yarmuIke?

751
00:49:21,118 --> 00:49:24,053
ActuaIIy, I`m dressed for work.
Hi, H. B.

752
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:27,056
I`m here. Who`s going
to taIk to me?

753
00:49:29,092 --> 00:49:31,060
Srta. HoIden. Henry Burton.

754
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:36,065
-Hi. I`m Terry Hicks.
-Jennifer.

755
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:41,070
-Hi. Lib.
-Hi, shit-for-brains.

756
00:49:41,138 --> 00:49:43,072
You Iearned to watch
your mouth yet?

757
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,075
I wiII not Iet you fuck up this
campaign, too!

758
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,078
That was 20 years ago.

759
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:52,081
Yes, I was thinner then.
I had a waist.

760
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:55,084
-Peter GoIdsmith.
-EIIa Louise Harriman.

761
00:49:55,152 --> 00:49:57,086
-Where is this happening?
-What?

762
00:49:57,154 --> 00:49:59,088
The fucking meeting.

763
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:05,094
I`II need a safe house.
I know the one.

764
00:50:05,162 --> 00:50:07,096
LittIe. Nice rose garden.

765
00:50:07,164 --> 00:50:10,099
CaII Becky Raymond.
673-4982.

766
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:14,103
TeII her it`s for the Governor.
She`II understand. Now, staff.

767
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:19,108
I want her. The one who Iooks
Iike Winona Ryder.

768
00:50:19,176 --> 00:50:21,110
Gorgeous. Is she smart?

769
00:50:21,178 --> 00:50:23,112
Oh, she`s smart.

770
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:26,115
I want her right away.
Start.

771
00:50:28,151 --> 00:50:32,110
A BIack Advocate reporter dug up
the Governor`s Chicago arrest.

772
00:50:32,189 --> 00:50:34,123
-We can`t stop that.

773
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:39,128
But we`re concerned there
may be other things.

774
00:50:39,196 --> 00:50:41,130
-Like Cashmere McIeod.
-Who?

775
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:44,133
You don`t know shit, do you?

776
00:50:45,168 --> 00:50:47,136
-Susan`s hairdresser?
-And Jack`s porkpie.

777
00:50:47,204 --> 00:50:50,139
-What?
-Oh, for Christ`s sake, act your age.

778
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:54,143
Jack Stanton fucks around
and has enemies.

779
00:50:55,178 --> 00:50:58,147
But what can Susan`s
hairdresser do to us?

780
00:50:58,215 --> 00:51:01,082
SeII her story to the ``FIash``
for $150.000...

781
00:51:01,151 --> 00:51:04,086
minus the 10% she`s giving
to the sIimesucking...

782
00:51:04,154 --> 00:51:08,090
shitty night schooI attorney
who`s agenting the deaI.

783
00:51:09,126 --> 00:51:13,085
-You know this?
-No, I imagined it in the booby hatch!

784
00:51:13,163 --> 00:51:16,098
-It`s buIIshit.
-In your dreams, sweetheart.

785
00:51:16,166 --> 00:51:18,100
She can`t hurt us. She`s
seIIing a story.

786
00:51:18,168 --> 00:51:20,102
She has no proof,
no credibiIity.

787
00:51:21,138 --> 00:51:25,097
It`s the tip of the iceberg. Jackie`s
done some pretty stupid things.

788
00:51:26,143 --> 00:51:30,102
He`s poked his pecker in some
sorry trash bins. We have to...

789
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:35,117
stop them before they stop us.
Crush them and sweep them up.

790
00:51:35,185 --> 00:51:38,120
From now on, you can caII me
the Dustbuster.

791
00:51:39,156 --> 00:51:42,125
You know, honey chiId...I`m
stronger than dirt.

792
00:51:42,192 --> 00:51:43,124
I beIieve you.

793
00:51:45,162 --> 00:51:47,130
We couId offer her $200,000
not to print it.

794
00:51:47,197 --> 00:51:49,131
Then kiII her to make sure?

795
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:51,133
The important thing is he did
nothing wrong.

796
00:51:51,201 --> 00:51:54,136
-He shouId act pissed off.
-But not too pissed off.

797
00:51:54,204 --> 00:51:58,140
More Iike, ``It`s too bad, but we
don`t take it seriousIy.``

798
00:51:58,208 --> 00:52:00,177
``It`s not a frightening as thing
that happen to reaI,...

799
00:52:00,177 --> 00:52:02,077
peopIe Iike Iosing a job.

800
00:52:03,113 --> 00:52:05,081
-Where`s the Iight?
-I`m Iooking.

801
00:52:05,148 --> 00:52:07,082
``Shit happens, but we`re caIm
in a shit storm.``

802
00:52:08,118 --> 00:52:11,087
Or maybe, ``We expected
this kind or crap.``

803
00:52:11,154 --> 00:52:13,088
Right. The usuaI media
trash bash.

804
00:52:13,156 --> 00:52:16,091
But why did he do it? Did he think
Cashmere wouId be so...

805
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:18,093
honored she`s never teII?

806
00:52:19,129 --> 00:52:22,098
-Maybe it isn`t true.
-WouId it matter?

807
00:52:22,165 --> 00:52:25,100
-It`d be better if it wasn`t.
-Why?

808
00:52:26,136 --> 00:52:29,105
HitIer was faithfuI to Eva Braun.
Does that make him better?

809
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,108
Or Jefferson or RooseveIt or
Kennedy, or any of the...

810
00:52:32,175 --> 00:52:34,109
guys who fucked around?

811
00:52:35,145 --> 00:52:37,113
But we can`t say that
in interviews.

812
00:52:39,149 --> 00:52:41,117
No. Of course not.

813
00:52:41,518 --> 00:52:45,352
Today, a potentially explosive
development for Governor...

814
00:52:45,422 --> 00:52:49,358
Jack Stanton is this quest for the
Democratic presidential nomination.

815
00:52:49,426 --> 00:52:53,362
A hairdresser has alleged an affair
with the married candidate.

816
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:57,366
The story, unconfirmed, appeared
today in the Flash.``

817
00:52:57,434 --> 00:53:00,369
Stanton has made no statement
regarding the woman,...

818
00:53:00,437 --> 00:53:01,369
Cashmere McLeod...

819
00:53:01,438 --> 00:53:04,373
but the accusation directly
follows the disclosure...

820
00:53:04,441 --> 00:53:09,378
that Governor Stanton was arrested
in 1968 in Chicago.

821
00:53:09,446 --> 00:53:11,380
Fucking Eyewitness News.

822
00:53:12,415 --> 00:53:14,383
Ted KoppeI wants someone
for his show.

823
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:17,386
-``60 minutes`` too.
-Do we have to take this?

824
00:53:17,454 --> 00:53:20,389
They`re treating this garbage
Iike a reaI story.

825
00:53:20,457 --> 00:53:22,391
We can`t ignore it.

826
00:53:22,459 --> 00:53:25,394
They couId write off Chicago...
it was 30 years ago.

827
00:53:25,462 --> 00:53:27,396
Or Cashmere... she was paid
for her story.

828
00:53:27,464 --> 00:53:30,399
But the two, right on top
of each other?

829
00:53:30,467 --> 00:53:35,404
PeopIe wiII say, ``Do we want a radicaI
who messes with hairdressers?``

830
00:53:35,472 --> 00:53:37,406
He did not fuck Cashmere
McLeod.

831
00:53:38,441 --> 00:53:41,410
If you can`t handIe that fact,
Ieave now.

832
00:53:46,383 --> 00:53:48,351
Okay, Iet`s think this through.

833
00:53:50,387 --> 00:53:52,355
Who has thoughts about
``60 minutes``?

834
00:53:52,422 --> 00:53:56,358
I think do it. You agree to
aII these interviews.

835
00:53:56,426 --> 00:53:58,360
Show them we`ve
nothing to hide.

836
00:53:58,428 --> 00:54:01,363
And soon, because this
wiII cut into the money.

837
00:54:02,399 --> 00:54:05,368
We shouId act Iike we
expected this...

838
00:55:09,399 --> 00:55:11,401
Henry. Sit down, have
some coffee.

839
00:55:11,401 --> 00:55:13,369
You going to get some
sIeep tonight?

840
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:17,372
AbsoIuteIy. Don`t you worry. I was
just taIking to Danny, here.

841
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,375
Danny Scanion, this is my friend,
Henry Burton.

842
00:55:22,412 --> 00:55:24,380
Can I get you something?
AppIe fritter?

843
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:31,376
Danny works here every night,
12-hour, $5,25 an hour.

844
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:35,390
Like I was teIIing the Governor, I don`t
mind. I`d mind if I couIdn`t work.

845
00:55:36,426 --> 00:55:38,394
-``AppIe fritter?``
-Not for me.

846
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:43,331
What was the best coIIege game
you saw aII year?

847
00:55:45,368 --> 00:55:46,335
Utah state versus
San Diego state.

848
00:55:48,371 --> 00:55:51,340
That was a great game. I saw it.
Great ground game.

849
00:55:53,376 --> 00:55:55,344
You need a good
ground game.

850
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:00,349
-``AppIe fritter?``
-No, I just said...

851
00:56:00,417 --> 00:56:02,351
I`II have one, Dan.
But just one.

852
00:56:02,419 --> 00:56:05,354
I`II make some fresh coffee.

853
00:56:06,389 --> 00:56:08,357
-If you want some, you caII me.
-Thank you, Danny.

854
00:56:14,397 --> 00:56:18,356
You Iook tired, Governor. Maybe
it`s time to go home.

855
00:56:18,435 --> 00:56:21,370
-They`II kiII me with trash.
-Don`t Iet them.

856
00:56:21,438 --> 00:56:24,373
It`s my own damn fauIt. I
didn`t keep it together.

857
00:56:26,409 --> 00:56:30,368
We can stiII win this thing.
We`re going to win it.

858
00:56:30,447 --> 00:56:32,381
And these probIems are nothing
compared to what...

859
00:56:32,449 --> 00:56:34,383
average foIks go through.

860
00:56:35,418 --> 00:56:39,377
Losing their jobs, Iosing their
homes. Keep that in mind.

861
00:56:39,456 --> 00:56:41,390
Keep the foIks in your mind.

862
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:45,327
-It`s about them, isn`t it?
-It`s about them. It`s about history.

863
00:56:45,395 --> 00:56:50,332
That`s truer for Susan than for me.
It`s aIways been about them.

864
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,336
Like this feIIa, Danny Scanion. He`s
worked every day since he was 1 4.

865
00:56:56,372 --> 00:56:58,340
CouIdn`t get insurance, couIdn`t
get his Ieg fixed right.

866
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:03,334
Doesn`t compIain. Doesn`t do
anyone my harm.

867
00:57:03,413 --> 00:57:05,347
Aching to do good.

868
00:57:09,385 --> 00:57:11,353
God, if you Iet a man Iike
that go down...

869
00:57:11,421 --> 00:57:13,355
you don`t deserve to take up
space on the pIanet.

870
00:57:13,423 --> 00:57:15,357
We won`t Iet him go down.

871
00:57:33,409 --> 00:57:35,377
Bummer. Bummer.

872
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:37,379
What? Libby?

873
00:57:37,447 --> 00:57:41,383
-She`s got tapes.
-Who has tapes?

874
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:45,319
Cashmere, the hair sIut, you moron.
She`s pIaying them tomorrow.

875
00:57:45,388 --> 00:57:47,322
I have no time for ineptitude!

876
00:57:48,358 --> 00:57:52,317
Now teII Jack and Susan the cunt has
tapes and back to Mammoth FaIIs.

877
00:58:11,381 --> 00:58:15,340
Honey, I have to run.
I wiII. HoId on.

878
00:58:16,386 --> 00:58:18,354
The new member of the swimming
team wants to taIk to you.

879
00:58:19,422 --> 00:58:22,357
Hey, Jackie Boy. That`s great.
You made it.

880
00:58:23,393 --> 00:58:25,361
That`s great. We`re proud of you.

881
00:58:26,396 --> 00:58:29,365
No, that`s just a bunch of
campaign garbage.

882
00:58:29,432 --> 00:58:31,366
Governor, this can`t wait.

883
00:58:32,402 --> 00:58:36,361
We`II caII you tonight. I Iove you.
Bye. What is it?

884
00:58:37,407 --> 00:58:41,411
Libby says Cashmere McLeod has
tapes of you and her taIking...

885
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:42,309
on the phone and...

886
00:58:43,346 --> 00:58:45,314
she`s going to pIay them
tomorrow.

887
00:58:48,351 --> 00:58:52,310
-I`m sorry.
-How bad?

888
00:58:52,388 --> 00:58:54,322
-I don`t know.
-Did you teII her...

889
00:58:55,358 --> 00:58:57,326
-Henry, excuse us.
-Sure.

890
00:59:05,368 --> 00:59:09,327
lt`s cold here, Sam, but these are
friendly people. Reminds me of home.

891
00:59:09,405 --> 00:59:12,340
I Iike her hair that way.
It softens her face.

892
00:59:13,376 --> 00:59:15,344
Yes. It couId be Ionger, though.

893
00:59:15,411 --> 00:59:17,345
lf you spent a day with us...

894
00:59:17,413 --> 00:59:21,349
you`d see what folks care
about is the future.

895
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:25,353
-He`s gotten fat.
-He jogs, so how much does he eat?

896
00:59:25,421 --> 00:59:26,353
And what does he eat?

897
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:28,357
What`s he governor of?

898
00:59:28,424 --> 00:59:31,359
Let me see...it`s
not Georgia...

899
00:59:31,427 --> 00:59:33,361
not FIorida...

900
00:59:35,398 --> 00:59:37,366
Sam, l`m not going to dignify
that trash.

901
00:59:38,401 --> 00:59:42,303
At a time when the American people
have a lot to be concerned about...

902
00:59:43,339 --> 00:59:45,307
I saw a picture of the hairdresser.
Not bad.

903
00:59:46,342 --> 00:59:49,311
l don`t think this is fair.

904
00:59:50,346 --> 00:59:55,306
People suffer and struggle and go
through all sorts of things.

905
00:59:55,385 --> 00:59:57,319
What matters is, we`re still here.

906
00:59:58,354 --> 01:00:01,323
lf you want to draw a lesson from
that about Jack`s character...

907
01:00:01,391 --> 01:00:04,326
here it is. He will stick.

908
01:00:04,394 --> 01:00:06,328
He will work through tough times.

909
01:00:07,363 --> 01:00:10,332
He will bust his butt for the
American People.

910
01:00:11,367 --> 01:00:13,335
`` Bust his butt. ``The
mouth on her.

911
01:00:13,403 --> 01:00:15,337
He shouId take her in hand.

912
01:00:17,373 --> 01:00:19,341
She`s honest. They had probIems.
Maybe that`s when he...

913
01:00:19,409 --> 01:00:20,341
screwed the hairdresser.

914
01:00:31,387 --> 01:00:33,355
You watching? It`s going
off now.

915
01:00:33,423 --> 01:00:35,357
And we`re out. Thanks,
everyone.

916
01:00:37,393 --> 01:00:38,360
It`s over.

917
01:00:38,428 --> 01:00:41,363
How`d it pIay? Wasn`t
she fantastic?

918
01:00:42,331 --> 01:00:45,300
Yeah, great. But they`d Iike to
see hair a IittIe Ionger.

919
01:00:58,347 --> 01:00:59,314
Hey, Henry!

920
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:04,319
-How Iong are you in town?
-Not Iong.

921
01:01:04,387 --> 01:01:06,321
No time to taIk. We got to
get to SaiIor`s and....

922
01:01:06,389 --> 01:01:08,323
watch Cashmere with
an expert.

923
01:01:08,391 --> 01:01:10,325
You take care of yourseIf,
dear.

924
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,328
I`II be home for dinner. We`II
take my truck.

925
01:01:24,373 --> 01:01:27,342
So you met Jack and Susan
working for McGovern?

926
01:01:29,378 --> 01:01:30,345
What were they are?

927
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:32,347
GIorious.

928
01:01:33,382 --> 01:01:35,350
GoIden. GoIden.

929
01:01:36,385 --> 01:01:37,352
Did they have any asoir...

930
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:42,288
Please, mister, please...

931
01:01:44,327 --> 01:01:47,296
Don`t play B17...

932
01:01:48,331 --> 01:01:50,299
lt was our song,
lt was our song

933
01:01:50,366 --> 01:01:52,300
Sing with me, Henry!

934
01:01:54,337 --> 01:01:55,304
Please, mister, please...

935
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:00,309
lf you know what l mean...

936
01:02:03,346 --> 01:02:05,314
Play that song again.

937
01:02:10,353 --> 01:02:11,320
SaiIorman!

938
01:02:13,356 --> 01:02:15,324
Good to see you, Libby. How
was the booby hatch?

939
01:02:16,359 --> 01:02:20,318
A better cIass of drugs than the
oId days. Where`s the beer?

940
01:02:23,366 --> 01:02:25,334
WeIcome to the worId
of eIectronics.

941
01:02:26,369 --> 01:02:30,328
Brewski. Here she comes.

942
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:33,342
Recording.

943
01:02:38,381 --> 01:02:40,349
I know just what she Iooked
Iike in high schooI.

944
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:42,350
l`m Sherman Preslay, Miss
Mcleod`s attorney.

945
01:02:42,418 --> 01:02:44,352
l want to make one
thing clear.

946
01:02:45,388 --> 01:02:47,356
We`ll take no questions until the
tapes are played.

947
01:02:48,391 --> 01:02:50,359
This will not be an inquisition.

948
01:02:50,426 --> 01:02:52,360
Yeah, right. We get
the inquisition.

949
01:02:53,396 --> 01:02:56,365
The tapes were recorded on Miss
McLeod`s phone machine.

950
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,369
This portion was recorded just
before Thanksgiving.

951
01:03:01,404 --> 01:03:04,373
Governor Jack Stanton
seduced me...

952
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:09,378
and l have tapes to prove it.

953
01:03:12,415 --> 01:03:15,384
-l`m on my way to meet the family.
-But you said you loved me...

954
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:22,380
You said no one could do the things
l did to you. l could come up there.

955
01:03:22,458 --> 01:03:24,392
God, what a whiny bitch.

956
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:26,394
Remember that time l met
you in Dallas?

957
01:03:28,431 --> 01:03:30,399
l get hot just thinking about it.

958
01:03:31,434 --> 01:03:35,393
-What you doing this weekend?
-Nothing, now that you`re leaving.

959
01:03:36,439 --> 01:03:39,408
Open a bottle of Chablis. Do you
think it`s possible to get laid?

960
01:03:40,443 --> 01:03:44,345
l`d say it`s entirely possible, if
you postpone that trip.

961
01:03:45,381 --> 01:03:46,348
l`m too homy to think straight.

962
01:03:47,383 --> 01:03:50,352
As you can see, these tapes
were recorded on...

963
01:03:50,419 --> 01:03:52,353
Miss McLeod`s phone machine.

964
01:03:52,421 --> 01:03:54,355
I`II record the rest of it.
Let`s go to work.

965
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,359
I`II kiII him. How couId he be so dumb?

966
01:03:57,426 --> 01:03:59,360
There are some
abrupt cutouts.

967
01:04:00,396 --> 01:04:02,364
l`m on my way to meet
the family.

968
01:04:02,398 --> 01:04:04,366
An abrupt cutout right there.

969
01:04:05,401 --> 01:04:06,368
What are you doing
this weekend?

970
01:04:07,403 --> 01:04:10,372
That`s picked up in mid-sentence,
or it couId be.

971
01:04:11,407 --> 01:04:13,375
Open a bottle of Chablis.
Do you think it`s at...

972
01:04:13,442 --> 01:04:15,376
all possible to get laid?

973
01:04:16,412 --> 01:04:20,371
That breakup in the middIe couId
be static or they used its to cover.

974
01:04:21,417 --> 01:04:26,377
Wait a second. Wait a goddamn
second. PIay that again.

975
01:04:28,424 --> 01:04:30,392
Do you think it` at all possible
to get laid?

976
01:04:33,429 --> 01:04:34,396
-Again.

977
01:04:35,431 --> 01:04:37,399
-Just again. Damn it!
-Do you think it`s at aII...

978
01:04:37,466 --> 01:04:39,400
possibIe to get Iaid?

979
01:04:42,371 --> 01:04:43,338
YourseIf.

980
01:04:44,373 --> 01:04:45,340
YourseIf.

981
01:04:47,376 --> 01:04:50,345
Henry, are you cracking up ? Two
of us wouId be one too many.

982
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,348
Un-fucking-beIievabIe!

983
01:04:54,383 --> 01:04:57,352
He said, ``Do you think it`s at aII
possibIe to get yourseIf Iaid?

984
01:04:57,420 --> 01:05:00,355
He said he didn`t want me to be
too horny to think straight.

985
01:05:00,423 --> 01:05:05,360
It was before Thanksgiving. PIay
it again from the top.

986
01:05:05,428 --> 01:05:06,360
Just his Iines.

987
01:05:06,429 --> 01:05:07,361
Shit!

988
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:10,365
l`m on my way to meet
the family.

989
01:05:12,401 --> 01:05:14,369
There was an accident, a bender,
on the interstate.

990
01:05:14,437 --> 01:05:16,371
That`s the famiIy he was going
to meet. Next.

991
01:05:17,406 --> 01:05:18,373
What you doing this weekend?

992
01:05:20,409 --> 01:05:21,376
-An abrupt cutout, right?

993
01:05:23,412 --> 01:05:25,380
He said, ``What are you doing
this weekend, Henry?``

994
01:05:28,417 --> 01:05:30,385
He caIIed me Henry. I remember the
whoIe caII, it meant so much to me.

995
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:32,387
Christ, we got her!

996
01:05:33,422 --> 01:05:36,391
You got her. We don`t. How
do we prove it?

997
01:05:38,427 --> 01:05:41,396
Oh, no, no. No, Libby, They...

998
01:05:42,365 --> 01:05:44,333
They can`t get away with this.
This cannot be a worId...

999
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,369
that Iets them get away it.

1000
01:05:46,369 --> 01:05:51,329
Imagine a bIack boy saying that.
What a priviIeged Iife you`re had.

1001
01:05:51,407 --> 01:05:53,341
But never mind about the worId.

1002
01:05:53,409 --> 01:05:55,343
I won`t Iet them get away with it.

1003
01:05:55,411 --> 01:05:59,347
I`II track down Ted KoppeI
and Larry King.

1004
01:05:59,415 --> 01:06:01,349
Can you naiI their ceIIuIar
conversations?

1005
01:06:01,417 --> 01:06:03,351
I have to rent a van.

1006
01:06:03,419 --> 01:06:07,355
Sure. We`II pick the best one.
Let`s go, Henry.

1007
01:06:08,391 --> 01:06:10,359
We have to change the
worId now.

1008
01:06:12,395 --> 01:06:15,364
You asshoIe! Yes, it was off
a ceIIuIar phone.

1009
01:06:15,431 --> 01:06:18,366
But don`t puII that outraged
puppy shit.

1010
01:06:18,434 --> 01:06:21,369
You haven`t become an innocent
just because the tape is phony.

1011
01:06:22,405 --> 01:06:25,374
I wish we`d castrated you when
we had the chance.

1012
01:06:25,441 --> 01:06:27,375
Libby, you`re on a ceII phone.

1013
01:06:27,443 --> 01:06:28,375
Oh, shit!

1014
01:06:30,413 --> 01:06:33,382
Yes, I`m goddamn sure I
know who did it.

1015
01:06:34,417 --> 01:06:37,386
Yes. I`II get it done.

1016
01:06:38,421 --> 01:06:39,388
Okay. Bye.

1017
01:06:40,423 --> 01:06:42,323
You know who did it?

1018
01:06:42,391 --> 01:06:44,325
Yes. Oh, yes, indeed.

1019
01:06:46,362 --> 01:06:49,331
A triumphant day, huh, Randy?
Perhaps your best ever.

1020
01:06:50,366 --> 01:06:52,334
-Is that Cashmere on the Iine?
-No.

1021
01:06:52,401 --> 01:06:55,336
Then say good-bye to
Sherman PresIey.

1022
01:06:56,372 --> 01:06:58,340
It`s not Sherman PresIay,
whoever he is.

1023
01:06:58,407 --> 01:07:02,343
-You`re branched out. EIectronics now.
-What do you mean?

1024
01:07:02,411 --> 01:07:04,345
You`ve been recording your friend
Jack`s private conversations.

1025
01:07:05,414 --> 01:07:09,350
Why wouId I do that? I`m a big
Stanton supporter.

1026
01:07:09,418 --> 01:07:11,352
I aIways have been.

1027
01:07:13,389 --> 01:07:16,358
I`ve been here 20 seconds and you`ve
aIready exhausted my patience.

1028
01:07:16,425 --> 01:07:18,359
I want a signed confession.

1029
01:07:18,427 --> 01:07:22,363
Libby, put that away before you
get yourseIf in troubIe!

1030
01:07:22,431 --> 01:07:24,365
Randy, you human turd...

1031
01:07:24,433 --> 01:07:28,369
you admit you ambushed Jack
Stanton, or you die.

1032
01:07:28,437 --> 01:07:30,371
-You`re crazy!
-Certi-fucking-fiabIy.

1033
01:07:30,439 --> 01:07:33,374
-At Iast, a fact!
-You`II go to jaiI, too.

1034
01:07:33,442 --> 01:07:35,376
I knew nothing about this.

1035
01:07:36,412 --> 01:07:40,371
He`s shocked. He had no idea. Now,
are you going to write this out?

1036
01:07:40,449 --> 01:07:42,314
I don`t know what you mean!

1037
01:07:44,353 --> 01:07:47,322
You know what? I`m going to
bIow your nuts off.

1038
01:07:48,357 --> 01:07:52,316
Yes, I am a Iesbian. I do not
mythoIogize the maIe organ.

1039
01:07:52,394 --> 01:07:57,331
Now, you tiny scumbag,
I know you did it.

1040
01:07:57,399 --> 01:07:59,333
You`re on retainer
to the FIash.

1041
01:07:59,401 --> 01:08:02,336
And you, you stupid shit...

1042
01:08:02,404 --> 01:08:05,339
the crap Jack actuaIIy did wasn`t
enough...you had to embeIIish it.

1043
01:08:05,407 --> 01:08:08,342
-Mister, you`re about to
become missus.

1044
01:08:10,379 --> 01:08:12,347
You have a choice to make.
And quickIy.

1045
01:08:13,382 --> 01:08:16,351
Just how crazy is Libby? And
you have to do it now. One...

1046
01:08:16,418 --> 01:08:21,355
two... This is going to be fun.

1047
01:08:21,423 --> 01:08:23,357
Okay. Okay. Okay!

1048
01:08:24,393 --> 01:08:27,362
Very good. Very wise.

1049
01:08:28,397 --> 01:08:31,366
Now, I want you to be eIoquent
in this Ietter.

1050
01:08:32,401 --> 01:08:35,370
GuiIt-ridden about your
jeaIousy and greed.

1051
01:08:36,405 --> 01:08:40,364
You couIdn`t Iive with yourseIf if you
deprived America of this great man.

1052
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:45,312
Tonight, an aide of Governor Jack
Stanton, is joining us to play a tape.

1053
01:08:47,349 --> 01:08:49,317
l haven`t heard the tape, but
my producer has.

1054
01:08:50,352 --> 01:08:52,320
We`d like to thank her for letting
us go on with such...

1055
01:08:52,388 --> 01:08:54,322
short notice. Here we go.

1056
01:08:55,357 --> 01:08:57,325
l can be there in 1 4 minutes.

1057
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:59,327
l could come up there.

1058
01:08:59,395 --> 01:09:02,330
No, l can`t wait. l have to
have it now.

1059
01:09:03,365 --> 01:09:06,334
Entirely. l get hot just
thinking about it.

1060
01:09:06,402 --> 01:09:08,336
Look at King. Look at his face.

1061
01:09:11,373 --> 01:09:12,340
That sounded like me.

1062
01:09:12,408 --> 01:09:16,344
lt was you, asking the head
waiter at Caf Des Artistes...

1063
01:09:16,412 --> 01:09:19,347
to seat you right away because
you hadn`t eaten all day.

1064
01:09:20,382 --> 01:09:22,350
-But how...
-We recorded it off your cell phone.

1065
01:09:24,386 --> 01:09:28,345
l`d like to read a letter from the man
who did this to Governor Stanton.

1066
01:09:29,391 --> 01:09:33,350
``To whom it May concern: l am an
employee of the Flash``

1067
01:09:34,396 --> 01:09:36,364
l took innocent statements of
Governor Stanton`s...

1068
01:09:36,432 --> 01:09:38,366
off his cellular phone...

1069
01:09:38,434 --> 01:09:41,403
edited them and paid Cashmere
McLeod to pretend...

1070
01:09:41,403 --> 01:09:43,303
she was talking to him.

1071
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:47,309
l did this for my own gain
and advancement.

1072
01:09:47,376 --> 01:09:51,312
l confess it now because l
cannot live with the fear...

1073
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:55,316
that l may deprive the American
people of a great man.``

1074
01:09:57,353 --> 01:10:00,322
Signed, Randy Culligan,
Attorney-at-law.

1075
01:10:00,389 --> 01:10:02,323
Now l think the media owes
Governor Stanton an apology...

1076
01:10:02,391 --> 01:10:06,327
for spreading this unsubstantiated
garbage.

1077
01:10:06,395 --> 01:10:07,327
Very good, girI.

1078
01:10:07,396 --> 01:10:10,331
lt should be harder than this to
smear an innocent man.

1079
01:10:12,368 --> 01:10:14,336
We`ll be right back with
your phone calls.

1080
01:10:15,371 --> 01:10:17,339
How did you get my cellular?

1081
01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:20,342
Henry, weII done.

1082
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:58,369
I want to thank you aII for sticking
with us through aII this.

1083
01:10:59,404 --> 01:11:02,373
We haven`t much time, but
with your heIp...

1084
01:11:02,441 --> 01:11:06,377
and the grace of God, we`II get
done what needs to be done.

1085
01:11:07,412 --> 01:11:09,380
It`s been pretty awfuI, but
we`re stiII here.

1086
01:11:20,425 --> 01:11:22,393
lt would be easy to get laughs...

1087
01:11:22,461 --> 01:11:27,398
by doing some cheap blow-dry
jokes...so l`ll get started.

1088
01:11:29,434 --> 01:11:31,402
lt all started innocently for
Governor Stanton.

1089
01:11:32,437 --> 01:11:35,406
He walked in one day and
asked for a little trim.

1090
01:11:35,474 --> 01:11:37,408
And some longer bangs.

1091
01:11:40,445 --> 01:11:42,345
They just don`t care about
the fine points.

1092
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,350
No, it wouId ruin the
punch Iine.

1093
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:49,354
Does anyone survive one of
these feeding frenzies?

1094
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:52,357
lf they`ve been around a while,
of maybe.

1095
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,360
But this is the first thing
people hear about...

1096
01:11:55,427 --> 01:11:57,361
Stanton, so he`s history.

1097
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,368
Our the land...

1098
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,371
of the free...

1099
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:09,374
and the home

1100
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:13,378
of the brave

1101
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,387
Thank you, PhiI.

1102
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:28,393
As head of the Portsmouth
Democratic Party...

1103
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:31,395
it is my pIeasure to introduce...

1104
01:12:31,463 --> 01:12:34,398
one of the south`s most
progressive governors...

1105
01:12:34,466 --> 01:12:38,402
and the husband of one the best
fIy-fishers I`ve met.

1106
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:41,405
PIease weIcome Governor
Jack Stanton.

1107
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:54,419
Thank you for that kind
introduction, Tommy.

1108
01:12:54,486 --> 01:12:57,421
And thank you for the fish.

1109
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:03,417
He gave me a big, sIab-sided, white
beIIied feIIa. Looked a Iot Iike me.

1110
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:07,432
Put it on the griII, gave it some heat.
Kind of Iike I`m getting now.

1111
01:13:09,501 --> 01:13:12,436
Thank you for coming tonight.
I know you work hard...

1112
01:13:12,504 --> 01:13:15,439
and have IittIe time to rest.

1113
01:13:15,507 --> 01:13:17,441
Some of us got more time
than we`d Iike.

1114
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:20,445
Right. I understand.

1115
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,449
Since this factory cIosed, how
many of you have found work?

1116
01:13:24,516 --> 01:13:25,448
Raise your hands.

1117
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:31,456
How many of you work jobs that
just pay the rent, no matter...

1118
01:13:31,523 --> 01:13:33,457
how many hours you work?

1119
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:37,462
My mama worked jobs Iike that
after my daddy died.

1120
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:41,466
I remember her coming home from
work just bone weary.

1121
01:13:42,434 --> 01:13:46,393
I know she wanted to pIay with
me and ask me about schooI.

1122
01:13:46,471 --> 01:13:48,405
But sometimes you`re too tires
to do anything but bIob...

1123
01:13:48,473 --> 01:13:50,407
out in front of the tube.

1124
01:13:50,475 --> 01:13:52,409
You got that right.

1125
01:13:54,446 --> 01:13:56,414
I don`t have to teII you how
hard it is to find work...

1126
01:13:56,481 --> 01:13:59,416
or anything at aII about
hard times.

1127
01:14:00,452 --> 01:14:04,411
So I`m going to do something
reaIIy outrageous.

1128
01:14:04,489 --> 01:14:06,423
I`m going it teII the truth.

1129
01:14:09,461 --> 01:14:11,429
I know what you`re thinking.

1130
01:14:11,496 --> 01:14:13,430
``He must be reaIIy desperate
to do that.``

1131
01:14:13,498 --> 01:14:16,433
But if you`ve had to swaIIow
enough sh...garbage...

1132
01:14:17,469 --> 01:14:19,437
You can say ``shit``.
We`re X-rated.

1133
01:14:21,473 --> 01:14:23,441
Me too, if you beIieve
the papers.

1134
01:14:33,485 --> 01:14:34,452
Here`s the truth.

1135
01:14:35,487 --> 01:14:39,446
No poIitician can re-open this
factory or bring back the...

1136
01:14:39,524 --> 01:14:41,493
shipyard jobs or make your
union strong again.

1137
01:14:41,493 --> 01:14:43,393
No poIitician can make it
the way it was.

1138
01:14:43,461 --> 01:14:47,397
Because we now Iive in a worId
without economic borders.

1139
01:14:48,433 --> 01:14:51,402
Push a button in New York and
a biIIion doIIars moves to Tokyo.

1140
01:14:51,469 --> 01:14:55,405
In that worId, muscIe jobs go where
muscIe Iabor is cheap,...

1141
01:14:55,473 --> 01:14:57,407
and that is not here.

1142
01:14:59,444 --> 01:15:01,412
So to compete, you have to
exercise a different muscIe...

1143
01:15:01,479 --> 01:15:03,413
the one between your ears.

1144
01:15:04,449 --> 01:15:07,418
-He`s Iost them.
-Fuck them. He`s got me.

1145
01:15:07,485 --> 01:15:09,419
The whoIe country must go
back to schooI.

1146
01:15:10,455 --> 01:15:13,424
We have to get smarter, Iearn
new skiIIs. And I promise this:

1147
01:15:13,491 --> 01:15:17,427
I wiII work hard for you. I wiII
think about you.

1148
01:15:17,495 --> 01:15:21,431
I wiII fight to make education a
Iifetime thing in this country...

1149
01:15:21,499 --> 01:15:23,433
to give you the support you
need to move up.

1150
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:29,429
But you have to do the heavy
Iifting your own seIves.

1151
01:15:30,475 --> 01:15:32,443
Now, I`ve taken a Iot of hits
in this campaign.

1152
01:15:33,478 --> 01:15:35,446
But you know what
that means?

1153
01:15:35,513 --> 01:15:38,448
It means someone thinks you`re onIy
interested in that kind of garbage.

1154
01:15:38,516 --> 01:15:42,000
So Tuesday, when you go to cast
your vote, think about that.
