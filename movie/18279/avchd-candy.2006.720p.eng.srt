1
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,283
When I first met Candy

2
00:02:56,638 --> 00:02:58,721
Those were like the days of juice..

3
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,471
Everything was bountiful...

4
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,533
Birds filled the sky ...

5
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:14,658
a great kindness float through us...

6
00:03:23,929 --> 00:03:26,013
Heaven

7
00:03:41,325 --> 00:03:43,408
Here it is.

8
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:51,325
I'm gonna try it your way this time.

9
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,783
This is just as good this way. Honestly.

10
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:07,158
Then why don't you do it?

11
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,158
Schumann, Why don't I do it?

12
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:16,013
Dan is a follower, Candy. Not a leader.

13
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:20,492
We stick to snorting, keep it simple.

14
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:22,367
You know...Dare to be different!

15
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:26,846
Well I think I'd like to try it in the bath.

16
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:30,908
well that's different.

17
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:43,408
Candy?

18
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,450
Candy!

19
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:51,325
Schumann, fucking help me!

20
00:04:51,846 --> 00:04:52,575
What?

21
00:04:52,783 --> 00:04:53,408
Come here!

22
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,679
Come here!Babe?

23
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:01,117
Oh, Christ!

24
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:02,263
Shit, I think that she took too much.

25
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:04,763
Babe!

26
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,783
Fucking saline solution or something? I need saline solution!

27
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:09,033
What?

28
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:11,117
Fuck it!Go and get a glass of water...

29
00:05:11,117 --> 00:05:12,888
Put salt in it! Hurry up!

30
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,783
Come on!Babe!

31
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:19,763
Candy! Look at me!

32
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:22,157
How much salt?

33
00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:22,888
I don't know! HEAPS!

34
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,971
Just fucking stir it! Make sure it's dissolved!

35
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,992
Come here!Oh baby? Fuck!!

36
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:35,075
I don't think this works man!What the fuck's salt gonna do?

37
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:36,638
Shut up!

38
00:05:39,554 --> 00:05:41,533
Fuck!Hold her arm!

39
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,096
Hold her fucking arm, man!

40
00:05:43,096 --> 00:05:45,179
Harder!

41
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:47,677
This will not be ...

42
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:48,617
Here we go ...

43
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:50,700
No, it's not gonna fucking work!It's bullshit!!

44
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,638
Shut up!

45
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:53,721
Call an ambulance.

46
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:57,992
Here we go.

47
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,533
Candy, look at me.

48
00:06:01,742 --> 00:06:03,825
Candy! Candy!

49
00:06:04,242 --> 00:06:06,325
Candy, Look at me!

50
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,617
Babe ...

51
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:11,325
Bring her back.

52
00:06:11,742 --> 00:06:13,825
...back.

53
00:06:15,388 --> 00:06:17,471
Enough with the fucking salt.

54
00:06:20,492 --> 00:06:22,575
It was beautiful.

55
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:25,596
Intense.

56
00:06:34,554 --> 00:06:36,638
The future or the thing that gleamed.

57
00:06:37,888 --> 00:06:39,971
The present was so very, very good.

58
00:06:42,263 --> 00:06:44,346
I wasn't trying to wreck Candy's life

59
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:47,158
I was trying to make mine better.

60
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,700
We wanted to share absolutely everything.

61
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,763
Especially the best bits .

62
00:06:55,283 --> 00:06:57,367
I want to stay with you forever.

63
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:02,263
...and who would'nt!

64
00:07:11,742 --> 00:07:13,825
It's us!

65
00:07:16,638 --> 00:07:18,721
It's called "The afternoon of extravagant delight. "

66
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:22,263
By Candy Wyatt.

67
00:07:23,825 --> 00:07:25,908
It's beautiful.

68
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:28,513
I love it!

69
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:32,263
Casper.

70
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:34,242
Casper, It's Dan.

71
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:36,429
Daniel, hang on!, I'm coming in on a win and a prayer!

72
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:39,033
What?

73
00:08:39,242 --> 00:08:41,117
I'm trying to land a Jumbo in Dubai.

74
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,158
What?

75
00:08:42,263 --> 00:08:45,283
Casper was like the dad you always wanted.

76
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:49,867
The one that lets you have lollies and fizzy drinks

77
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:53,617
he lets you stay up late,

78
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,075
and watch movieslate at night.

79
00:08:55,388 --> 00:08:57,471
Daniel, how are you?

80
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,763
Casper and I went way back.

81
00:08:59,763 --> 00:09:00,492
I love you

82
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:04,867
Is that right?

83
00:09:04,971 --> 00:09:05,908
Yes!

84
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,992
This is George.

85
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,283
A very limited English,but a very large penis.

86
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:13,721
Isn't that right, George?

87
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:15,804
Ok.

88
00:09:15,908 --> 00:09:19,554
Our entire conversation is based on the 1995 "Lonely Planet" guide to Havana

89
00:09:21,117 --> 00:09:23,200
Sit down.

90
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:28,513
Just good friends.

91
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:32,992
So, what's on the agenda today?

92
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:35,804
Not much, we're just wandering around.

93
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:41,013
Um, Could you spare us $50?

94
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:45,908
Does is ever embarrassed you, Candy?...His naked desperation!

95
00:09:45,908 --> 00:09:48,617
Nakedness, I can deal with!

96
00:09:48,617 --> 00:09:50,700
Or give us some ecstasy .we can sell for it?

97
00:09:51,221 --> 00:09:53,304
I'm afraid that my days as a manufacturer of ...

98
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:56,429
recreational farmaceuticals has come to an end.

99
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,471
Why's that?

100
00:09:57,575 --> 00:10:00,492
I've been made Associate Professor of Organic Chemistry.

101
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:02,575
- Wow! Congratulations. - Great.

102
00:10:02,992 --> 00:10:05,075
So, suddenly I have a reputation to uphold.

103
00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:08,929
Well in that case, could we make it a hundred?

104
00:10:10,388 --> 00:10:12,471
We'll pay it back!

105
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:27,054
Thanks, Cas.

106
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:29,138
Everything's alright, isn't it?

107
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:33,408
It's just a cash flow problem.Only 7 days.

108
00:10:35,492 --> 00:10:37,575
And you, Candy?

109
00:10:37,575 --> 00:10:40,179
Being one that's so new to the path of the dead!

110
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:43,513
She is fine.

111
00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:49,242
When you can stop,people don't want to...

112
00:10:49,242 --> 00:10:52,367
... and when you want to stop,You can't!

113
00:10:56,846 --> 00:10:59,554
One of life's little riddles!

114
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:02,263
What Grandma?

115
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:04,763
Off you go!

116
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:06,846
Thank you, Casper.

117
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:10,492
Okay, are you ready?

118
00:11:10,492 --> 00:11:12,575
One, two, three ...

119
00:11:20,283 --> 00:11:23,408
I feel like some confused Sesame Street character!

120
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,408
Start the car.

121
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,096
My own parents had long since cut me adrift

122
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:27,679
The Wyatts, on the other hand,kept their firm hold on the ropes.

123
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:31,950
Do you want more potatoes?

124
00:12:32,158 --> 00:12:35,804
It was nice to visit places where the fridge was always full.

125
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:43,096
I shall have to bring my plate round when I come here!

126
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:47,158
I think you'll find that's part of the carbohydrate.

127
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:49,242
What do you think?

128
00:12:49,554 --> 00:12:54,033
I don't know.I don't know.

129
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,763
See how you go.

130
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:02,992
Stretchers?

131
00:13:03,513 --> 00:13:06,638
They're like wooden frames you stretch the canvass on.

132
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:10,908
and anyway, I feel really stupid ...

133
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:17,075
I did about a month ago,and as of tomorrow I'm gonna lose our deposit on the stretchers.

134
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:20,179
It is really rude to ask ...

135
00:13:22,783 --> 00:13:24,867
but at least I won't surprise her!

136
00:13:27,783 --> 00:13:30,908
I can give you the money back the next time I see you again.

137
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:34,138
Can you ring him, and tell him to wait for a week?

138
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:36,638
I already tried that pretty much last week.

139
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,033
What if I rang him for you?

140
00:13:42,158 --> 00:13:44,242
I haven't got the card with me.

141
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,617
How much is it?

142
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,804
150.

143
00:13:50,804 --> 00:13:52,888
Mate, the question is not the money.

144
00:13:53,304 --> 00:13:55,388
I really appreciate it.

145
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:59,138
The question...is the future of my daughter.

146
00:14:01,221 --> 00:14:03,304
Mate, she's fantastic!

147
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:06,117
Should see her paintings!

148
00:14:06,117 --> 00:14:07,679
The question is you.

149
00:14:08,408 --> 00:14:10,492
When are you gonna do something?

150
00:14:14,138 --> 00:14:16,221
I've got some ideas.

151
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:21,429
I've sent some of my poems into Heat magazine.

152
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:29,033
- Here we are! - Milk...and sugar, There!

153
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:31,950
- Thanks babe! - Thanks, Elaine.

154
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:35,179
You're not a teenager anymore.

155
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,992
You know that, don't you?

156
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:39,033
Yes, I know that, Jim.

157
00:14:43,408 --> 00:14:45,492
that is why I did'nt want you to do it!

158
00:14:45,492 --> 00:14:47,471
No, it's alright! It's fine!

159
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:48,825
Look at it!You've turned it into butter!

160
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:51,013
I told you to keep it on blend!

161
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:53,304
I put it on "Whip", because I'm whipping cream!

162
00:14:53,617 --> 00:14:55,700
Yes, but you don't know how to use it.

163
00:14:56,117 --> 00:14:58,200
Right... You do it!!

164
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,533
- Uhh! Well it's too late now! - Ah well! Excuse me!!

165
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,929
Well all these settings are relative,and if you're not familiar with the workings of the machine ...

166
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:07,783
Then why the fuck does it say "Whip"?

167
00:15:10,804 --> 00:15:12,888
I'll give them ice cream.

168
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:16,846
And please don't swear.

169
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:23,617
Right! Well, I was going to give you cream,but I'm going to have to give you Ice Cream.

170
00:15:26,221 --> 00:15:28,825
-  Everything okay in there? - Well, we live in hope!

171
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:32,367
A good place to live.

172
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:19,346
Go!!

173
00:16:45,596 --> 00:16:47,679
I wonder if that was it?

174
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:49,971
If that was what?

175
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,783
The last shot.

176
00:16:57,054 --> 00:16:59,138
I wouldn't care.

177
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:28,825
It was my Nana's.

178
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,783
We're going to sell anything.We're only hocking it!

179
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,283
We'll get it back!

180
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,615
$25.

181
00:17:58,617 --> 00:18:00,700
and He doesn't want the paints.

182
00:18:14,242 --> 00:18:16,325
I'll be back!

183
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:20,075
He said maybe we could work something out!.

184
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,825
Let's go!

185
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:47,367
Yes, I fucked him!

186
00:19:48,617 --> 00:19:50,700
For $50.

187
00:19:51,013 --> 00:19:53,096
I stink!

188
00:19:53,617 --> 00:19:55,700
You okay?

189
00:19:58,617 --> 00:20:00,700
I'm Sorry.

190
00:20:00,804 --> 00:20:02,888
Don't be!

191
00:20:16,117 --> 00:20:18,721
Here is the deepest secret that nobody knows .

192
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:23,200
Here is the root of the root,and the bud of the bud...

193
00:20:23,408 --> 00:20:26,533
and the sky of the sky,in the tree called life .

194
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,846
which grows higher than soul can hope, or mind can hide .

195
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:37,783
and this is the one that is keeping the stars apart.

196
00:20:39,763 --> 00:20:41,846
I carry your heart.

197
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,971
I carry it in my heart.

198
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:52,367
Will you marry me?

199
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,908
We will be man and wife.

200
00:21:26,742 --> 00:21:28,825
One flesh.

201
00:21:32,888 --> 00:21:37,367
I will ask them if they freely undertake the obligations of marriage ...

202
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:41,742
... and to state that there is no legal impediment to the marriage.

203
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,325
Are you ready,freely and without reservation ...

204
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:50,492
to give yourself to eachother... in marriage?

205
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:53,513
We are!

206
00:21:54,763 --> 00:21:57,679
Are you ready for love and honor each other ...

207
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:02,054
as husband and wife, for the rest of your life?

208
00:22:02,992 --> 00:22:05,075
- We are! - We are!

209
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:07,158
Candice and Dan ...

210
00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:14,658
Come back, love.

211
00:22:15,283 --> 00:22:16,533
Ah, okay.

212
00:22:17,054 --> 00:22:19,658
Alright everyone, Close together! Balloons down, Jenny.

213
00:22:19,867 --> 00:22:22,367
Big smiles, everyone! Happy Day!

214
00:22:22,367 --> 00:22:24,242
One, two... Oh, Shit!

215
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:25,388
Schumann!

216
00:22:25,388 --> 00:22:28,617
- One, two... Three! - Right...

217
00:22:28,617 --> 00:22:31,950
Alright everyone! Back to our place for a few drinks,and a bite to eat?

218
00:22:32,888 --> 00:22:35,492
I'm sorry, I'm going to have to go,I've got an appointment!

219
00:22:35,492 --> 00:22:38,096
Oh! Well, I hope that nobody else has got an appointment!

220
00:22:38,408 --> 00:22:40,492
I'm in for the long hall, Mrs. Wyatt.

221
00:22:40,908 --> 00:22:41,950
Good.

222
00:22:42,575 --> 00:22:44,138
No, I hate spelling!

223
00:22:44,138 --> 00:22:46,013
Yeah, me too! Spelling and maths!

224
00:22:46,013 --> 00:22:48,304
I was always hopeless at spelling and maths.

225
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,492
- I like English. - English?

226
00:22:50,492 --> 00:22:51,533
Like stories and stuff?

227
00:22:51,742 --> 00:22:52,783
Yeah!

228
00:22:52,783 --> 00:22:54,346
English and Sport!

229
00:22:54,346 --> 00:22:55,179
Well you can't go wrong there.

230
00:22:55,388 --> 00:22:56,846
You can be a Sports journalist.

231
00:22:56,846 --> 00:22:57,575
Really?

232
00:22:57,575 --> 00:22:58,617
I could see you as a sports journalist.

233
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:01,013
Well, Dan, you're laughing mate!

234
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:03,096
Financing this love as a married couple.

235
00:23:03,721 --> 00:23:06,325
You get the first one under your belt,you pour everything into it.

236
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,033
After that, the minimum equity is what you're after.

237
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,950
You get into as much debt as possible.

238
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:14,242
It gives you some focus.

239
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:17,783
I'm not just talking about real estate.

240
00:23:17,783 --> 00:23:20,596
I'm talking about a philosophy.

241
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,888
Would you mind...if you excuse me for a minute?

242
00:23:22,888 --> 00:23:23,929
No! Sure!!

243
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:29,867
Where are you and Dan going for the honeymoon?

244
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,158
-  More lemonade?  - Yeah, thanks!

245
00:23:35,075 --> 00:23:36,950
You're so tight! You're selling next year?

246
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:40,596
Abbots Road! It's just round the corner from us!

247
00:23:40,908 --> 00:23:42,888
Geez, that'll be a change, eh?

248
00:23:42,992 --> 00:23:46,325
Yeah, I'd rather go to a state school,but, it's mom and dad...

249
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:49,554
Jenny, could you come and help with sanwiches

250
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:51,221
I'll give you a hand too, Auntie Cap!

251
00:23:57,054 --> 00:23:59,658
-  What? -  What are you doing in there?

252
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:01,950
Doing a shit.

253
00:24:02,263 --> 00:24:04,346
No you're not!

254
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:09,138
Open the door.

255
00:24:09,138 --> 00:24:11,117
I can't!

256
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:14,658
You greedy fuckup!!

257
00:24:16,325 --> 00:24:18,408
Rather a selfish way to begin a marriage!

258
00:24:19,138 --> 00:24:21,221
Really! All done!

259
00:24:24,242 --> 00:24:25,283
Dick!

260
00:24:25,283 --> 00:24:27,263
Obviously, it was a big dope weekend!

261
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:31,117
You wanna be relaxed at your own wedding.

262
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,263
- Sorry about that. - That's fine!

263
00:24:43,096 --> 00:24:45,179
So where were we?

264
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:46,013
I was saying, you need to get your t...

265
00:24:46,325 --> 00:24:48,408
Do you need a seat? Yeah, sure! Have a seat!

266
00:24:49,242 --> 00:24:51,325
You need to get your toe in the the market, Jim!

267
00:24:51,846 --> 00:24:53,929
You know what I'mn saying? Out of suburbs, fine!

268
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,533
Two bedroom...

269
00:24:56,638 --> 00:24:58,096
...You don't need a garden courtyard, do you?

270
00:24:58,513 --> 00:25:00,596
You want the worst house, in the best street!

271
00:25:02,575 --> 00:25:04,554
You don't need a kitchen or bathroom...

272
00:25:04,554 --> 00:25:06,117
Put it in later!

273
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:08,304
Say for example, you want to borrow ...

274
00:25:08,304 --> 00:25:09,763
400.

275
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:14,138
Or 300

276
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:24,867
You do it...You Struggle...

277
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:26,950
Understand?

278
00:25:27,054 --> 00:25:28,304
Dan?

279
00:25:28,825 --> 00:25:30,908
Dan?

280
00:25:31,325 --> 00:25:33,408
Dan!

281
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:36,013
Dan...

282
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:38,617
Wake up.

283
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:40,804
Dan, Dan, wake up.

284
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:44,554
I'm fucked.

285
00:25:45,283 --> 00:25:47,367
Too much champagne.

286
00:25:47,575 --> 00:25:49,658
Yeah I'm...I'm sure it's that...

287
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,888
Well, it is the big day!

288
00:25:52,888 --> 00:25:54,971
I'll make some coffee.

289
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,221
He's drunk!

290
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,283
Is there anything you want to talk to me about?

291
00:26:10,492 --> 00:26:12,575
What?

292
00:26:12,575 --> 00:26:14,033
What's going on?

293
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:15,700
Mum, you know what's going on!

294
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,846
We are having a lovely time!

295
00:26:16,846 --> 00:26:18,929
That's not what I meant.

296
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:22,054
Well then, I don't know what you mean!

297
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:25,388
What's wrong with Dan?

298
00:26:25,388 --> 00:26:29,242
He's just pissed, Mum!He's hopeless!!

299
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,783
Sorry.

300
00:26:32,783 --> 00:26:34,867
Thanks for the beautiful reception.

301
00:26:38,617 --> 00:26:41,742
It'd kill your father, you know.

302
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,867
Think we should stop?

303
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:03,513
- What? Now that we're respectable? - Yeah, I know!

304
00:27:06,846 --> 00:27:08,929
You know what I mean.

305
00:27:09,658 --> 00:27:11,742
Whenever you say the word.

306
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,158
We are the coolest people in McDonalds!

307
00:27:27,992 --> 00:27:30,075
We had a lot going for us.

308
00:27:31,742 --> 00:27:36,117
We'd found the secret glue that held all things together

309
00:27:38,096 --> 00:27:40,179
in a perfect place...

310
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,367
...where the noise did not intrude.

311
00:27:46,325 --> 00:27:50,388
Our world was...so very complete.

312
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,346
Earth

313
00:28:12,471 --> 00:28:14,554
- Hey baby! - Hi!

314
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:16,950
How was it?

315
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,513
About the same.

316
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:20,388
Here's $200.

317
00:28:20,388 --> 00:28:22,054
I'm gonna give it half an hour and then I'll split!

318
00:28:22,054 --> 00:28:24,033
Yeah. I won't be long.I'll meet you at home.

319
00:28:24,138 --> 00:28:25,179
Ok, I see you there.

320
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,783
OK.

321
00:28:29,554 --> 00:28:32,054
They say that for every 10 years you've been a junkie ...

322
00:28:32,158 --> 00:28:35,388
You will have spent 7 of them...waiting.

323
00:28:37,158 --> 00:28:40,908
One way is not bad have as much time to think .

324
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:45,179
on the other, the anxiety was a full time job!

325
00:28:59,033 --> 00:29:01,117
-  Hey? -  You slimey cunt!

326
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,763
-  What?  -  What do you fucking reckon?

327
00:29:04,763 --> 00:29:06,846
I just had a quick little bit! It was nothing!

328
00:29:07,158 --> 00:29:08,721
Where?

329
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:10,283
Um, In the park. When I met Ange.

330
00:29:10,283 --> 00:29:11,846
Did Angela do it with you?

331
00:29:11,846 --> 00:29:13,929
No, of course not! We left as soon as we did the deal!

332
00:29:14,658 --> 00:29:17,367
Only because he's decent enough to go home to his girlfriend.Like you should be!

333
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:21,013
Oh candy! He sold me the dope! Why would he want to have a hit in the public toilet?

334
00:29:21,325 --> 00:29:23,408
Well why the fuck would you?

335
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:28,825
Oww!Look, I admit it was dumb!

336
00:29:28,825 --> 00:29:30,908
Okay?

337
00:29:30,908 --> 00:29:31,950
I'm Sorry!

338
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,033
Will you let me make you a nice taste!

339
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:35,075
I'm getting sick of this, dickhead!

340
00:29:35,075 --> 00:29:36,117
What is your problem?

341
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:37,575
You are my problem!

342
00:29:37,783 --> 00:29:39,242
You are a waste of space.

343
00:29:42,471 --> 00:29:44,138
Are you getting your period or something?

344
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:45,283
No, Dan.

345
00:29:45,388 --> 00:29:47,054
I hardly have my period anymore!

346
00:29:47,158 --> 00:29:48,721
...because my body's all fucked up!

347
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:51,221
It's this fucking nightmare you've led me into!

348
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:53,408
Oh right! Like I held a gun to your head! Did I? Eh??

349
00:29:54,658 --> 00:29:56,742
Held you down, hit you up, did I?

350
00:29:57,367 --> 00:29:58,408
Fuck You!

351
00:29:58,825 --> 00:30:00,075
Fuck you too, Candy!

352
00:30:00,804 --> 00:30:02,888
Well, Fuck you double then!

353
00:30:32,783 --> 00:30:36,117
Dan, have you noticed, the more I work, the less I paint?

354
00:30:38,096 --> 00:30:40,492
Candy, I don't want a fight! OK?

355
00:30:41,221 --> 00:30:43,617
I just don't see what your problem is tonight! I mean...

356
00:30:45,492 --> 00:30:47,575
We've got a life!

357
00:30:47,575 --> 00:30:49,554
It's neither good nor bad! OK?

358
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:55,492
Do you know... Do you know what I do?

359
00:30:56,846 --> 00:30:58,825
Listen to this, dick fuck!

360
00:30:58,825 --> 00:31:00,804
What do I do all day?

361
00:31:00,908 --> 00:31:02,575
I fuck men I hate!

362
00:31:02,992 --> 00:31:04,971
- Don't do this. - What are going to do about it?

363
00:31:05,075 --> 00:31:06,742
Look, Okay, that's it! Alright?

364
00:31:06,846 --> 00:31:08,929
No more brothels, No more escorts!

365
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:11,013
- We're gonna take the time to start a new life! - You don't understand do you?

366
00:31:11,117 --> 00:31:13,200
That's really it this time.That's going away!

367
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,075
Maybe I want to keep using!

368
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:17,158
You know, I'm sick of working,yes,but...

369
00:31:17,158 --> 00:31:19,242
...What if I want to keep using? What are you gonna do about it?

370
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,492
Candy!

371
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,575
Why don't you ring gay blokes?

372
00:31:23,513 --> 00:31:25,388
You start working!You hock your ass!

373
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:27,575
Hey, you know you can not do that!

374
00:31:28,617 --> 00:31:30,700
You know, I'll get...I'll get AIDS!

375
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,575
No you won't, you moron!

376
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:34,867
You'll make them use condoms,like everybody else!

377
00:31:35,075 --> 00:31:37,054
I wouldn't know what to do.

378
00:31:37,054 --> 00:31:40,492
You're heterosexual, right? So you're just doing what you're good at anyway.

379
00:31:40,492 --> 00:31:41,742
Did you even hear what you're saying?

380
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:42,783
Let me fuck women, no problems!

381
00:31:42,783 --> 00:31:47,367
If I can do it with women, I'd make us all the money! You'd never have to work, I swear!

382
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:49,450
But... These women, they want muscle types, don't they?

383
00:31:50,804 --> 00:31:53,304
If there was a market out there, I'd do it, but I don't think there is!

384
00:31:53,304 --> 00:31:54,763
And I'd be hopeless with the gay stuff! You know that!

385
00:31:55,492 --> 00:31:56,742
You're fucking unbeleivable!

386
00:32:14,138 --> 00:32:16,221
I can't get to sleep with that on.

387
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:18,617
Can you turn it off?

388
00:32:19,033 --> 00:32:21,117
Candy, it's a really good movie!

389
00:32:21,846 --> 00:32:23,929
I'll turn it down, okay?

390
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:33,825
Anyway, it finishes in half an hour.

391
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:36,429
Fuck you!

392
00:32:37,471 --> 00:32:39,554
Go to bed.

393
00:32:41,117 --> 00:32:43,200
How can you even hear that?

394
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,867
The light's bugging me!

395
00:32:59,033 --> 00:33:01,117
I can't believe it.

396
00:33:01,117 --> 00:33:02,783
I can't fucking believe it.

397
00:33:03,304 --> 00:33:05,388
What? I'm not making any noise.

398
00:33:06,325 --> 00:33:08,408
The light!

399
00:33:08,825 --> 00:33:10,908
The Light's keeping me awake.

400
00:33:11,013 --> 00:33:13,096
OK, look! I'll cover the light!Hmm??

401
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:18,408
There's more light coming from the workshop than that!

402
00:33:18,513 --> 00:33:20,596
Asshole!

403
00:33:27,158 --> 00:33:30,283
The pen!! I can hear the pen scratching on the paper!

404
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,783
How? This is ridiculous, Candy.

405
00:33:32,783 --> 00:33:35,388
You're just looking for an excuse!

406
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:37,888
Turn off the light and come to bed.

407
00:33:37,888 --> 00:33:39,763
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore!

408
00:33:39,763 --> 00:33:41,013
Turn the light off!

409
00:33:41,013 --> 00:33:42,575
Nope! I'm not even talking to you!

410
00:33:42,575 --> 00:33:44,033
- Turn the fucking light off!! - ...Aghhh!

411
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,783
Fuck!!

412
00:33:47,783 --> 00:33:48,825
Oh my God! Oh my God!

413
00:33:48,825 --> 00:33:51,013
- Shit. - I'm so sorry, Danny!

414
00:33:51,117 --> 00:33:53,929
- What the fuck was that? - Oh my God! Oh baby! Oh shit!

415
00:33:55,596 --> 00:33:56,638
Jesus! It's fuckin' blood!

416
00:33:56,742 --> 00:33:57,783
I didn't mean to hurt you...

417
00:33:58,721 --> 00:34:03,929
Jesus fuckin' shit, alright!.Fuck!

418
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,950
Is there any chance for some morphine?

419
00:34:08,408 --> 00:34:10,492
I'm in a fair bit of pain.

420
00:34:13,513 --> 00:34:15,283
I don't think you need any morphine.

421
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:17,263
I don't think you're in much pain at all!

422
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,283
Oh well, it was worth a try!

423
00:34:28,304 --> 00:34:31,846
Excuse me, would you mind if we um,bought a couple of flavoured milks off you?

424
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:34,554
- Just take a couple. - You sure?

425
00:34:34,554 --> 00:34:35,804
No worries!

426
00:34:35,804 --> 00:34:36,950
- Want some of this? - Yeah!

427
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:40,700
- Have a good night! - Thanks. - Thankyou!

428
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:58,929
D'you want anymore?

429
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,533
It's been a while.

430
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,700
Yeah! It's been a while.

431
00:35:28,721 --> 00:35:30,804
I'm sorry I hurt your head.

432
00:35:34,138 --> 00:35:36,221
I'll get you back!

433
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:04,867
Hello.... Anybody home?

434
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,679
Who the fuck are you?

435
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:09,450
Yeah, it's me! Phil.

436
00:36:09,554 --> 00:36:11,638
Phillip Dudley,from Commercial Realty.

437
00:36:12,158 --> 00:36:14,242
I've written to you lately.

438
00:36:14,658 --> 00:36:21,429
- What's the problem? - Well...

439
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:27,783
We've been writing to you about...Um...

440
00:36:27,783 --> 00:36:32,679
I've got these..er.. hang on..Er, here they are!

441
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:36,325
Copies of the three letters we've sent you recently...

442
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:40,388
Relating to the matter of your er,rent in arrears.

443
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:48,617
I'm here to confirm that the 3rd of these letters is in actual fact a notice to vacate.

444
00:36:49,242 --> 00:36:51,325
Effective 7 days hence.

445
00:36:51,846 --> 00:36:52,679
Fuck!

446
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:58,200
Well of course it was...28 days when you received the letter.

447
00:36:59,763 --> 00:37:02,888
Now, what I'm actually here for today...

448
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:06,533
is to point out to you the shortfall owing on the fault of your bond.

449
00:37:06,533 --> 00:37:10,908
Assuming... you've paid no more rent between now and next wednesday...

450
00:37:10,908 --> 00:37:15,388
We've calculated that the shortfall will be er... $1,125.

451
00:37:16,221 --> 00:37:18,304
Listen, Phillip...

452
00:37:18,513 --> 00:37:20,596
...we're junkies!

453
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,783
I am a hooker!

454
00:37:22,888 --> 00:37:24,971
He's hopeless!

455
00:37:25,908 --> 00:37:30,388
Right now, things are very complicated! We haven't got any money.

456
00:37:35,908 --> 00:37:37,992
Right.

457
00:37:39,554 --> 00:37:41,117
 But it was good...

458
00:37:41,846 --> 00:37:43,513
 Right when times got tough...

459
00:37:43,617 --> 00:37:45,179
There was always Casper. .

460
00:37:46,638 --> 00:37:48,200
Ah, the young ones!

461
00:37:48,304 --> 00:37:49,346
Hi!

462
00:37:49,554 --> 00:37:51,638
Our... port in the storm!

463
00:37:51,742 --> 00:37:53,825
Don't get overexcited!

464
00:37:54,033 --> 00:37:56,117
our gingerbread house!

465
00:37:56,117 --> 00:38:03,096
For once... Here I come...Bearing Treats!

466
00:38:14,554 --> 00:38:16,638
So is this it?

467
00:38:16,742 --> 00:38:19,242
An honour student didn't show, so I had an idle hour to fill.

468
00:38:19,971 --> 00:38:22,054
You made that in an hour?

469
00:38:22,054 --> 00:38:25,804
Well... Panadine to morphine,in about an hour and 10!

470
00:38:26,742 --> 00:38:29,033
If you get rid of the paracetamol...

471
00:38:29,658 --> 00:38:31,221
...do a few things...

472
00:38:32,783 --> 00:38:35,492
...and morphine to heroin in 15 minutes.

473
00:38:38,408 --> 00:38:39,971
Thankyou, you guys!

474
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:41,846
Rearrange the atoms...

475
00:38:43,096 --> 00:38:44,138
...take a bit off...

476
00:38:45,283 --> 00:38:46,221
...put a bit on...

477
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,825
Liquid Diamorphine...

478
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:53,200
Commonly known as heroin,pharmaceutical grade, pure.

479
00:38:53,408 --> 00:38:55,492
I call it "My Yellow Jesus!"

480
00:38:57,367 --> 00:38:59,450
Papa bear.

481
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,325
Mama bear.

482
00:39:02,471 --> 00:39:04,554
Baby bear.

483
00:39:48,825 --> 00:39:53,825
It's just that... Candy says I have to start pulling my weight!

484
00:39:55,908 --> 00:39:57,992
Yeah.

485
00:40:03,304 --> 00:40:06,117
What do you know about gay escorts?

486
00:40:07,263 --> 00:40:09,346
Growth market.

487
00:40:12,471 --> 00:40:15,804
Would you mind if asked you a few technical questions?

488
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:21,846
There's nothing I'd rather discuss with you!

489
00:40:24,658 --> 00:40:27,158
What do they expect you to do?

490
00:40:27,783 --> 00:40:29,763
Well there's a big down in the park!

491
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:33,304
Why don't you pop down and do some research!

492
00:40:34,242 --> 00:40:35,908
I mean...

493
00:40:35,908 --> 00:40:42,575
If they pay you, would they expect you to have a stiffie?

494
00:40:45,283 --> 00:40:47,367
It Helps!

495
00:40:50,388 --> 00:40:53,617
I don't think I could manage that.

496
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:36,013
I'm just washing my hands.

497
00:41:59,971 --> 00:42:01,013
Alright!

498
00:42:01,117 --> 00:42:02,888
He'll cancel his cards.

499
00:42:02,992 --> 00:42:04,554
Not if I get to him first.

500
00:42:07,783 --> 00:42:12,367
M. Ro. Roger. Rog. Rogie baby!Roger, Donald.

501
00:42:12,367 --> 00:42:14,450
R.D. Here it is!

502
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:18,929
R.D. Moylan 48 Charles Street, Petersham.

503
00:42:19,033 --> 00:42:21,117
He'll trace the call.

504
00:42:21,117 --> 00:42:23,513
That's why they invented prepaid phones.

505
00:42:24,658 --> 00:42:26,742
Ah, Hi! Roger?

506
00:42:27,575 --> 00:42:29,658
Is that Roger Moylan?

507
00:42:29,658 --> 00:42:34,242
Yeah, Look! Look, This is hard...

508
00:42:34,242 --> 00:42:37,888
I'm the guy who stole your wallet.

509
00:42:38,825 --> 00:42:41,117
Yep! No, hold on! I'm sorry, okay? That's why I'm calling! I'm really sorry!

510
00:42:41,221 --> 00:42:45,492
I just... I was after some money,I saw some cash... and you had none...

511
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:47,575
I want to give your wallet back!

512
00:42:47,575 --> 00:42:52,158
No, I know! I feel so stupid!It's just that I'm...

513
00:42:52,158 --> 00:42:55,283
I'm so lonely right now...

514
00:42:55,283 --> 00:42:57,888
I've got no money,I've just come from Adelaide...

515
00:42:57,888 --> 00:42:59,554
And I've got no friends...

516
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,888
You know, I saw the wallet on the seat,and I took it! I wasn't thinking!

517
00:43:02,888 --> 00:43:04,867
And I'm not interested in your credit cards.

518
00:43:04,867 --> 00:43:07,679
I just want to do the right thing and give it back to you.

519
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,325
Uhh...  Well, no! I mean now's not a good time, I...

520
00:43:11,325 --> 00:43:14,033
I'm a little bit nervous about this whole thing anyway!

521
00:43:14,033 --> 00:43:16,846
Can we just...Let's meet in the morning!

522
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:18,929
What...What time do you go to work?

523
00:43:20,596 --> 00:43:22,679
So you're in Petersham, right?

524
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:26,325
Umm... Isn't there a footie oval down there or something?

525
00:43:27,263 --> 00:43:29,763
How about we meet out in front of the greyhound stand?

526
00:43:30,804 --> 00:43:32,158
9:30? Is that good?

527
00:43:34,242 --> 00:43:36,638
Well I'll be wearing a blue baseball cap!

528
00:43:36,638 --> 00:43:41,013
Look! look, Take my number!

529
00:43:41,533 --> 00:43:43,617
You got a pen? Yep, Right...

530
00:43:43,617 --> 00:43:51,221
- 0422 844 881 - [That's my Plumber's!]

531
00:43:51,221 --> 00:43:53,304
Yes, 881.

532
00:43:53,304 --> 00:43:57,992
Well, have you got...a mobile just in case there's a...

533
00:43:57,992 --> 00:44:03,096
Yeah... Yeah! Hey, Tell me one thing...

534
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,638
How did you manage to get such a cute photo on your license?

535
00:44:06,638 --> 00:44:10,075
I'm Sorry! Yeah, I'm sorry, I go too far!

536
00:44:12,575 --> 00:44:14,658
Alright! 9:30 then! I'll see you then!

537
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:18,617
Alright, Thanks Rog! Okay, bye!

538
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,763
Imagine if you'd turned your powers to the benefit of mankind... Dan!

539
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,679
Does this look like me?

540
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,283
Not even remotely.

541
00:44:31,533 --> 00:44:33,617
I could use these!

542
00:44:36,221 --> 00:44:38,304
And a bit of...

543
00:44:38,825 --> 00:44:40,908
...How about now?

544
00:44:42,783 --> 00:44:44,867
Caucasian man with glasses.

545
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:47,679
Yes!

546
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:55,804
I felt like Tarzan,at fuckin' last!

547
00:44:55,804 --> 00:44:58,721
I had to hunt down some food for Jane.

548
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:02,679
I knew it was in my power to do something brave.

549
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:56,533
Yeah...

550
00:45:56,533 --> 00:45:58,617
Can we talk about this when you get back to the office?

551
00:45:58,617 --> 00:46:00,908
20 minutes... Okay, bye!

552
00:46:00,908 --> 00:46:02,888
Sorry about that!

553
00:46:02,888 --> 00:46:04,242
Good morning,How are you?

554
00:46:04,242 --> 00:46:05,908
Ah, good!How are you?

555
00:46:05,908 --> 00:46:07,575
Good.

556
00:46:07,575 --> 00:46:10,179
I just uh, wanted to check my current balance on this please!

557
00:46:10,179 --> 00:46:12,888
Okay, I'll just need to get you to enter in your PIN...

558
00:46:16,013 --> 00:46:18,096
Oh God, I'm...terrible with this!

559
00:46:18,096 --> 00:46:22,158
God! Do you ever have trouble remembering your PIN?

560
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:26,013
You'd be surprised at the number of people who forget them.

561
00:46:26,013 --> 00:46:28,617
Yeah I know! That's why I came inside...

562
00:46:28,617 --> 00:46:30,596
Because I couldn't remember it out at the ATM, and I thought...

563
00:46:30,596 --> 00:46:33,408
You know I could just er..If I had ID?

564
00:46:33,408 --> 00:46:38,513
No! I'm sorry, you need your PIN number for all transactions. It's...

565
00:46:38,513 --> 00:46:40,283
It's one of those security things!

566
00:46:40,283 --> 00:46:42,471
No! Of course, of course!I understand. Um...

567
00:46:43,721 --> 00:46:45,804
So you can't just...

568
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:47,471
I really can't!

569
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:53,513
Hello?

570
00:46:53,513 --> 00:46:55,596
- Mr. Moylan? - Yes?

571
00:46:55,804 --> 00:46:57,888
- Mr. Roger Moylan?  - Yes?

572
00:46:57,888 --> 00:47:02,888
Roger Moylan, This is Ewan Douglasfrom the Commonwealth Bank Security division...

573
00:47:02,888 --> 00:47:05,908
Yes? Is something the matter?

574
00:47:06,117 --> 00:47:11,221
We've been tracking some unusual activity on your credit card, in the last 24 hours...

575
00:47:11,221 --> 00:47:12,263
Oh no!

576
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:14,867
When was the last time you used your Master Card?

577
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:19,242
Um, look! I think my wallet was stolen last night...

578
00:47:19,242 --> 00:47:21,950
Did you report it missing?

579
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,283
I was just calling now!

580
00:47:25,283 --> 00:47:26,846
 But I called you. 

581
00:47:26,846 --> 00:47:28,617
Um, I mean I was about to call.

582
00:47:29,242 --> 00:47:34,242
Sir, Mr. Moylan, I'm going to have to verify your details for a security check.

583
00:47:34,242 --> 00:47:36,429
Would you please tell me your Date of Birth?

584
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:39,450
Um... 13th of March, 1977.

585
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:41,950
Mother's Maiden Name?

586
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,929
Er, Lynch.

587
00:47:44,138 --> 00:47:45,492
Number of security?

588
00:47:45,492 --> 00:47:49,658
Is that like your PIN number?

589
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:54,033
Well, it shouldn't be...but you often find that it is!

590
00:47:54,033 --> 00:47:59,867
Umm...Try... 3279

591
00:48:16,325 --> 00:48:19,971
It's just one of those days, you know...where everythings just gone!

592
00:48:19,971 --> 00:48:22,263
It happens all the time!

593
00:48:22,263 --> 00:48:25,388
Um, but listen... I've already got my daily limit out from the ATM outside...

594
00:48:25,388 --> 00:48:29,554
...But I actually need more, because I'm trying to buy this beautiful old Mercedes....

595
00:48:29,554 --> 00:48:31,221
...you know, the cream ones,you know, the TLS?

596
00:48:31,221 --> 00:48:33,721
Anyway, the guy's willing to negotiate for cash...

597
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,783
...$2247.

598
00:48:43,408 --> 00:48:45,492
God, we're going to be in the poor house!

599
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,783
...and 50 cents.

600
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,700
Never get sentimental about a car!

601
00:48:55,283 --> 00:48:58,825
I might just get you to check the available credit on this card...

602
00:49:00,283 --> 00:49:02,367
I can get a cash advance, can't I?

603
00:49:05,388 --> 00:49:07,471
Candy? Candy!

604
00:49:07,471 --> 00:49:09,554
I did it! I did it! I fucking did it, baby!

605
00:49:11,325 --> 00:49:13,408
I fucking did it!

606
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:16,325
God, You... are going to fucking LOVE me for this...

607
00:49:16,325 --> 00:49:18,200
7 Grand!!

608
00:49:18,408 --> 00:49:20,596
Oh god! You should have seen it! I was fucking great! It was like...

609
00:49:21,117 --> 00:49:23,200
It was like that movie we saw with that...

610
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:27,054
God, what was his name,that actor we like?

611
00:49:27,054 --> 00:49:28,825
...and he gets all that money,and he walks in and he's all coool,and stuf like that...

612
00:49:29,335 --> 00:49:30,825
Danny!

613
00:49:35,581 --> 00:49:37,158
I'm pregnant.

614
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:40,492
Shit.

615
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:55,492
Candy.

616
00:49:55,596 --> 00:49:57,679
Crap.

617
00:49:59,658 --> 00:50:01,013
It couldn't be, uh...

618
00:50:05,804 --> 00:50:06,846
No.

619
00:50:07,158 --> 00:50:09,242
We never broke a condom.

620
00:50:10,388 --> 00:50:12,471
I'd know.

621
00:50:13,096 --> 00:50:15,179
It was the night I broke your skull.

622
00:50:17,575 --> 00:50:19,658
How fucking weird.

623
00:50:20,075 --> 00:50:22,158
One night.

624
00:50:25,908 --> 00:50:27,992
I can get an abortion.

625
00:50:29,658 --> 00:50:30,908
No.

626
00:50:31,325 --> 00:50:33,408
No, no way!

627
00:50:33,721 --> 00:50:35,804
This is good.

628
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:38,408
It was meant to be.

629
00:50:39,138 --> 00:50:41,221
This is what we need.

630
00:50:43,408 --> 00:50:45,492
We've got to stop using.

631
00:50:50,075 --> 00:50:51,325
Yeah.

632
00:50:53,825 --> 00:50:55,075
Yeah, of course.

633
00:51:03,617 --> 00:51:04,867
Sugar?

634
00:51:06,325 --> 00:51:07,575
Two, please.

635
00:51:10,075 --> 00:51:12,158
We've got some news everybody...

636
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:17,367
We're having a baby.

637
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:26,638
Ah, Darling!

638
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:11,475
Candice, Good God.

639
00:52:17,621 --> 00:52:21,788
We just wanted you to know that we've made some decisions. and uh...

640
00:52:22,517 --> 00:52:24,600
We've been putting some money aside,haven't we?

641
00:52:25,329 --> 00:52:27,621
We're going to get out of that whole warehouse environment.

642
00:52:27,933 --> 00:52:29,808
...and live in a proper house.

643
00:52:30,121 --> 00:52:32,100
Yeah! We really want to raise our child in the....

644
00:52:32,933 --> 00:52:35,433
...in a proper home.

645
00:52:36,371 --> 00:52:38,454
Have you told your parents?

646
00:52:40,642 --> 00:52:42,204
No.

647
00:52:45,642 --> 00:52:47,725
Day 1

648
00:52:51,475 --> 00:52:53,558
We knew what we had to do.

649
00:52:55,017 --> 00:52:57,933
It takes alot of planning to stop.

650
00:53:02,725 --> 00:53:04,808
Lucky at last!We can really do this, Candy.

651
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:08,558
It's going to be hard, but...

652
00:53:10,746 --> 00:53:12,829
I'm sure it's like a bridge...

653
00:53:13,975 --> 00:53:16,475
And once we cross it,everything will be okay.

654
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:20,433
You can get back into your painting again...

655
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:22,933
Maybe we'll move to the country...

656
00:53:23,142 --> 00:53:25,225
Grow some veggies...

657
00:53:25,225 --> 00:53:26,683
Feed the chickens...

658
00:53:29,183 --> 00:53:31,267
We could go live in Thailand...

659
00:53:36,475 --> 00:53:39,288
Thailand would be great,if we didn't use.

660
00:53:40,329 --> 00:53:42,413
Or the Himalayas.

661
00:53:44,183 --> 00:53:46,267
We'll go canoeing...

662
00:53:46,371 --> 00:53:48,454
A bit of white water rafting...

663
00:53:53,142 --> 00:53:56,683
Get healthy, sleep well...

664
00:53:57,308 --> 00:53:59,913
...not have drugs in our system.

665
00:54:01,788 --> 00:54:03,871
How good would that be?

666
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,579
We really have to do this.

667
00:54:13,767 --> 00:54:15,850
We have to do it this time.

668
00:54:16,267 --> 00:54:18,350
Yeah, we will.

669
00:54:19,392 --> 00:54:21,475
We are.

670
00:54:22,933 --> 00:54:25,017
We're really fuckin' doing it!

671
00:55:30,329 --> 00:55:32,413
Day 2

672
00:58:47,725 --> 00:58:49,808
Day 4

673
00:58:57,517 --> 00:58:59,600
I can't do it.

674
00:59:00,225 --> 00:59:02,308
I can't do it.

675
00:59:02,308 --> 00:59:04,704
Hey!Come back to bed.

676
00:59:04,913 --> 00:59:06,996
Alright? You'll catch a cold.

677
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,163
Casper, It's Candy.

678
00:59:36,163 --> 00:59:37,933
Ring me as soon as you get this.

679
00:59:38,142 --> 00:59:40,225
We've tried your mobile.

680
00:59:43,142 --> 00:59:46,267
I know we said to ignore us while we did this, but...

681
00:59:46,267 --> 00:59:47,829
3 days...

682
00:59:50,538 --> 00:59:52,829
...we did pretty well, but we're not feeling so great now.

683
00:59:52,829 --> 00:59:55,329
We don't want you to ignore us now.

684
00:59:57,204 --> 00:59:59,288
Are you there?

685
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:02,933
Pick up if you're there.

686
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:06,163
Pick up!

687
01:00:08,975 --> 01:00:11,058
Okay, you're not there.

688
01:00:11,058 --> 01:00:12,725
Call us!!

689
01:00:12,725 --> 01:00:13,975
Shit! Shit!

690
01:00:15,017 --> 01:00:16,058
Shit! Shit! Shit!

691
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,183
Kojak? It's Candy!

692
01:00:27,933 --> 01:00:29,288
Um... Shit, not so good.

693
01:00:31,475 --> 01:00:32,517
I'm really sick. I mean...

694
01:00:32,517 --> 01:00:34,704
We just need credit.

695
01:00:35,225 --> 01:00:37,413
Uh... I can work a shift,and then I can pay you back.

696
01:00:39,183 --> 01:00:42,204
Yeah, well if I work a shift,then I can pay that too.

697
01:00:44,392 --> 01:00:46,371
I can't work when I'm this sick!

698
01:00:48,142 --> 01:00:50,225
Ok, bye.

699
01:00:50,538 --> 01:00:52,621
Fucking cunt!!

700
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,163
Candy.

701
01:00:57,517 --> 01:01:01,788
- Candy. - Oh God!

702
01:01:01,788 --> 01:01:03,871
Answer!Answer, please!

703
01:01:08,038 --> 01:01:10,642
He was just about to answer!

704
01:01:10,954 --> 01:01:19,183
- Give me the phone.- I want the fucking phone!

705
01:01:19,183 --> 01:01:20,225
Don't fucking take it away from me!No! No!!

706
01:01:21,683 --> 01:01:28,142
- We can do it. - No! Get away!! Nooooo!!

707
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:30,225
Candy, you're bleeding.

708
01:01:30,433 --> 01:01:31,996
Candy, you're bleeding.

709
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,183
Why are you bleeding?

710
01:01:40,017 --> 01:01:43,454
The water has broken.Her cervix has dilated.

711
01:01:44,183 --> 01:01:46,058
This is what we didn't want to happen.

712
01:01:46,788 --> 01:01:49,288
We call this an inevitable miscarriage.

713
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:50,329
There's no going back.

714
01:01:50,954 --> 01:01:55,433
As I was explaining to Candy,she's going to have to go through a kind of... labour!

715
01:01:56,058 --> 01:02:00,017
I don't know however long that takes, you need to know that at this state of the pregnancy...

716
01:02:00,017 --> 01:02:01,788
...the baby is not going to survive.

717
01:02:03,142 --> 01:02:04,704
I'm Sorry.

718
01:02:46,579 --> 01:02:48,663
Give me pethidine!

719
01:02:48,663 --> 01:02:50,225
I want pethidine!

720
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,413
Will you give her the fucking pethidine, or what?

721
01:02:52,829 --> 01:02:54,913
She's fucking in pain,can't you see this?

722
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:11,163
That's it! Candy, push!

723
01:03:12,621 --> 01:03:14,704
Almost there! Push! That's it!!

724
01:03:37,933 --> 01:03:40,017
Can I hold it?

725
01:03:56,579 --> 01:03:58,767
Doctor, its leg moved.

726
01:03:59,183 --> 01:04:00,225
It's just a spasm.

727
01:04:00,225 --> 01:04:01,058
It moved!

728
01:04:01,058 --> 01:04:03,142
It's just a spasm.

729
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:10,954
Hell

730
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:57,933
- How much did you get?  - 50.

731
01:05:59,913 --> 01:06:01,996
That guy is still back there.

732
01:06:02,204 --> 01:06:04,913
- Maybe you'll sell some. Yeah? - Alright.

733
01:06:09,704 --> 01:06:11,788
Everything we ever did...

734
01:06:12,308 --> 01:06:14,392
 we did with the best of intentions... 

735
01:06:14,808 --> 01:06:19,183
 But.. events tumble!and the years pile up.

736
01:06:19,288 --> 01:06:23,767
 The world is very bewildering to a junkie. 

737
01:06:26,996 --> 01:06:29,079
Yeah, we're all good!

738
01:06:37,204 --> 01:06:43,975
- Well... Tastes bad. - Fuck!

739
01:06:43,975 --> 01:06:46,058
Here you go.

740
01:06:48,454 --> 01:06:50,538
Do you feel anything?

741
01:06:51,267 --> 01:06:52,829
No.

742
01:06:56,788 --> 01:06:58,871
- Shit!  - Shit!

743
01:07:04,183 --> 01:07:08,767
 and still... you cling to the concept of change. 

744
01:07:18,454 --> 01:07:20,538
Hey, Schumann...

745
01:07:20,538 --> 01:07:22,933
...we are thinking of moving up the country for a while.

746
01:07:22,933 --> 01:07:24,704
Give methadone a try.

747
01:07:27,204 --> 01:07:29,288
What the fuck difference would it make?

748
01:07:37,621 --> 01:07:40,538
The air's cleaner, for one.

749
01:08:37,621 --> 01:08:39,704
It's a kitchen.

750
01:08:46,892 --> 01:08:48,975
It's a bit dark, isn't it?

751
01:08:48,975 --> 01:08:50,017
Yeah.

752
01:08:51,058 --> 01:08:53,142
Yeah, we Could um...

753
01:08:53,142 --> 01:08:58,350
knock out a hole...and put a skylight.

754
01:09:16,475 --> 01:09:18,038
I love you.

755
01:09:52,517 --> 01:09:54,600
Any frozen peas?

756
01:09:55,121 --> 01:09:56,683
No.

757
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,746
I got one! There he is!

758
01:10:01,475 --> 01:10:03,558
It was all the way down in the turbo frost.

759
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,183
I can not believe you didn't do this, this morning.

760
01:10:14,496 --> 01:10:16,579
What time are they coming?

761
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:18,350
Fuck!!

762
01:10:34,183 --> 01:10:35,746
What's the date?

763
01:10:35,746 --> 01:10:38,246
Oh no, this expired a month ago.

764
01:10:42,308 --> 01:10:43,871
Look at that! It smells bad!

765
01:10:44,392 --> 01:10:46,475
- That's got that kind of chicken smell! - Yeah it does doesn't it!

766
01:10:47,725 --> 01:10:52,725
Not to worry, we'll just baste it in lots of stuff! Like uh...

767
01:10:52,725 --> 01:10:54,808
Basil, uh... honey? Bayleaves or something?

768
01:10:55,225 --> 01:10:57,308
What's in the cupboard?

769
01:10:58,038 --> 01:11:00,121
What do you put on a roast?

770
01:11:05,433 --> 01:11:08,246
How long did it take you to get out here?

771
01:11:08,767 --> 01:11:10,850
Oh, About an hour and 40 minutes? Dear?

772
01:11:15,329 --> 01:11:17,413
Yeah, about... 40? 45?

773
01:11:20,642 --> 01:11:22,204
Much traffic?

774
01:11:22,308 --> 01:11:24,392
No, pretty good run really.

775
01:11:24,704 --> 01:11:26,788
Can't complain.

776
01:11:28,975 --> 01:11:31,683
It's so beautiful here,the drive down was so beautiful.

777
01:11:31,683 --> 01:11:35,017
Yeah, it's... Countryside.

778
01:11:39,392 --> 01:11:41,475
Had any news on the job front?

779
01:11:42,829 --> 01:11:47,725
Um... Well it's pretty... There's not much work around here.We're getting by on the dole.

780
01:11:48,246 --> 01:11:51,267
Well, apparently I might be able to get some work hay bailing.

781
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:53,975
Hay bailing?

782
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,683
- Ooooh! Tough work, hay bailing!- Yeah.

783
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:02,829
So! What can I do in the kitchen?

784
01:12:02,933 --> 01:12:04,913
Nothing mum, really! It's fine!

785
01:12:04,913 --> 01:12:06,579
Nonsense, there must be something I can do to help.

786
01:12:06,892 --> 01:12:08,454
Everything's under control.

787
01:12:08,767 --> 01:12:10,329
The oven's heating up.

788
01:12:13,142 --> 01:12:15,017
We're running a bit behind.

789
01:12:15,642 --> 01:12:16,683
 No worries, mate. 

790
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:21,475
Oh This is unbelievable.You go to all this trouble to invite us up here...

791
01:12:21,475 --> 01:12:24,913
...and you can't even manage the simple decency of getting the meal together on time!

792
01:12:25,121 --> 01:12:26,579
Get off my case, mum!

793
01:12:26,579 --> 01:12:27,933
Is not food that's even the issue here.

794
01:12:27,933 --> 01:12:29,288
It's your attitude!

795
01:12:29,704 --> 01:12:31,892
Okay, let's just calm down. Lunch will be ready in less than an hour.

796
01:12:31,892 --> 01:12:32,933
Who wants some wine?

797
01:12:34,704 --> 01:12:36,579
That chicken is rock solid!

798
01:12:36,579 --> 01:12:39,079
We're not going to be eating before midnight.

799
01:12:39,183 --> 01:12:40,433
And where are the vegetables?

800
01:12:40,433 --> 01:12:41,475
Hey hey, Let's all calm down, honey.

801
01:12:42,204 --> 01:12:44,288
What do you think is about?

802
01:12:44,913 --> 01:12:47,933
Sunday Lunch.It's a pretty simple thing.

803
01:12:48,663 --> 01:12:50,850
But with you two, there's no such thing as simple.

804
01:12:51,163 --> 01:12:52,204
The drugs!

805
01:12:52,829 --> 01:12:55,329
The drugs always come first.

806
01:12:55,642 --> 01:12:57,413
Hey no, that is not true.

807
01:12:57,517 --> 01:12:59,704
We're doing really well now.

808
01:13:01,475 --> 01:13:03,558
Do you have any idea...

809
01:13:05,433 --> 01:13:08,871
...what you have done to my family?

810
01:13:10,225 --> 01:13:12,308
To me?

811
01:13:13,767 --> 01:13:16,892
What happened to that beautiful girl?

812
01:13:17,413 --> 01:13:19,496
What happened?

813
01:13:19,704 --> 01:13:21,788
What happened?

814
01:13:22,413 --> 01:13:24,496
Can't you see?

815
01:13:25,538 --> 01:13:27,621
Don't you understand?

816
01:13:28,142 --> 01:13:33,350
I have been clutching my fucking fists since I was 6 years old.

817
01:13:34,392 --> 01:13:36,475
Look at my fucking fists! Look at them!

818
01:13:38,975 --> 01:13:41,058
Look at them, you fucking bitch!

819
01:13:41,475 --> 01:13:43,558
Don't you understand?

820
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,621
No! I gotta clench my hands!

821
01:13:50,017 --> 01:13:51,371
I gotta clench my hands! I can't relax.

822
01:13:54,392 --> 01:13:57,933
Darling, darling! Look!It's been a big move.

823
01:13:57,933 --> 01:13:58,975
It's been a big year.

824
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,850
There's been lots of changes.

825
01:14:01,996 --> 01:14:03,871
C'mon, you've lost a child.

826
01:14:03,871 --> 01:14:06,892
But you ARE getting your lives together.I can see that!

827
01:14:08,454 --> 01:14:09,808
Just go.

828
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:12,100
Fuck off.

829
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:15,017
Forget lunch.

830
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:20,433
Can we?

831
01:14:20,954 --> 01:14:23,038
Can we cancel the lunch?

832
01:14:23,767 --> 01:14:25,850
Maybe we can just make this another day.

833
01:14:26,996 --> 01:14:30,121
Today is just a bad day.I'm sorry.

834
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:42,933
I'm scared.

835
01:14:46,163 --> 01:14:48,246
There's nothing to be scared of.

836
01:14:53,038 --> 01:14:55,121
There's nothing to be scared of.

837
01:15:01,267 --> 01:15:03,350
D'you think we're going to end?

838
01:15:06,058 --> 01:15:12,142
- We'll never end. - It'll end.

839
01:15:16,579 --> 01:15:18,663
It's not gonna work.

840
01:15:34,704 --> 01:15:36,788
Is that the flu vaccine?

841
01:15:36,788 --> 01:15:38,871
It's medicine.

842
01:15:40,329 --> 01:15:42,413
It's leading us not into temptation.

843
01:15:47,413 --> 01:15:49,496
Hey Candy, check out this.

844
01:15:49,496 --> 01:15:51,475
Brickie's labourer.

845
01:15:51,892 --> 01:15:53,975
- I'll give it a call, eh. - Why don't you do that.

846
01:16:56,788 --> 01:16:58,871
- Hi.- Hey!

847
01:17:05,642 --> 01:17:07,725
This is Paul. He lives up the road.

848
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:12,933
Good day.

849
01:17:13,246 --> 01:17:15,329
He's got some good home grow.

850
01:17:15,329 --> 01:17:17,413
Great.Can I get some more?

851
01:17:20,017 --> 01:17:22,100
Um... There is none left.

852
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:31,163
Then I'll grab a beer.

853
01:17:31,163 --> 01:17:32,829
There's none of that either.

854
01:17:38,558 --> 01:17:40,642
I'm gonna go and get some more pot.

855
01:17:41,996 --> 01:17:44,079
Uh.. We gonna grab some dinner,or What?

856
01:17:44,079 --> 01:17:45,850
No, you eat! I'll be fine.

857
01:17:47,517 --> 01:17:49,600
You want some money? I got paid.

858
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,371
- No. - No, it's okay mate.

859
01:18:53,871 --> 01:18:55,954
Where were you?

860
01:18:56,267 --> 01:18:58,350
Don't you fuck this one with your negative comments.

861
01:19:01,163 --> 01:19:03,246
What are you doing?

862
01:19:03,246 --> 01:19:05,121
Going back to my art.

863
01:19:05,121 --> 01:19:07,308
Does not mean anything to you?

864
01:19:07,621 --> 01:19:09,704
Have you been fucking that guy?

865
01:19:12,308 --> 01:19:14,392
You do not know what you're talking about.

866
01:19:14,392 --> 01:19:16,475
Where have you been all night?

867
01:19:16,579 --> 01:19:18,350
Away from you.

868
01:19:20,329 --> 01:19:22,413
You fucked him, didn't you?

869
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:29,183
Firstly...

870
01:19:29,913 --> 01:19:31,996
...You do not know what you're talking about.

871
01:19:33,246 --> 01:19:35,329
Secondly...

872
01:19:35,642 --> 01:19:36,683
...I hate the sound of your voice.

873
01:19:38,142 --> 01:19:39,183
Thirdly...

874
01:19:40,225 --> 01:19:41,788
...Why don't you just fuck off?

875
01:19:45,329 --> 01:19:47,413
I mean, really!

876
01:19:48,767 --> 01:19:50,850
Fuck off!

877
01:20:14,183 --> 01:20:17,100
Wakey wakey.Hands off snakey!

878
01:20:19,496 --> 01:20:21,579
What the fuck is that?

879
01:20:21,579 --> 01:20:24,871
A statement of fact.What do you think it is?

880
01:20:24,871 --> 01:20:27,954
And what's this with your mother anyway?

881
01:20:28,038 --> 01:20:30,121
Well if it's not her...

882
01:20:30,121 --> 01:20:30,954
...Then you.

883
01:20:31,163 --> 01:20:32,204
Great.

884
01:20:32,517 --> 01:20:34,600
Okay...You.

885
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:45,433
You think you're so smart,but youre just fuckin' mad!

886
01:20:49,704 --> 01:20:51,163
That's really good, Candy.

887
01:20:51,683 --> 01:20:53,246
That's good, glad you think that.

888
01:21:04,808 --> 01:21:06,892
Your a fuckin' poet!

889
01:22:32,308 --> 01:22:34,392
Once upon a time, there was a Candy and Dan...

890
01:22:37,517 --> 01:22:39,600
Things were very hot that year...

891
01:22:40,433 --> 01:22:42,517
All the wax was melting on the trees...

892
01:22:44,288 --> 01:22:48,871
He would crawl on balconies, climb everywhere. Do anything for her...

893
01:22:49,392 --> 01:22:51,475
My Danny boy.

894
01:22:53,350 --> 01:22:57,100
Thousands of birds. Thetiniest birds adorned her hair...

895
01:22:57,725 --> 01:22:59,808
 Everything was golden...

896
01:23:00,954 --> 01:23:03,038
 One night the bed caught fire...

897
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:08,038
 He was handsome, and a very good criminal...

898
01:23:08,767 --> 01:23:10,850
 We lived on sunlight and chocolate bars...

899
01:23:15,121 --> 01:23:18,204
 It was the afternoon of extravagant delight...

900
01:23:19,392 --> 01:23:21,475
 Danny, the Daredevil...

901
01:23:21,892 --> 01:23:23,767
Candy the blessing...

902
01:23:25,017 --> 01:23:28,975
 The day's last rays of sunshine cruise like sharks....

903
01:23:29,496 --> 01:23:31,996
 "I wanna try it your way this time!"

904
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:43,038
 You came into my life really fast, and I liked it.

905
01:23:43,558 --> 01:23:45,642
 We squelched in the mud of our joy.

906
01:23:47,725 --> 01:23:49,808
I was wet thighed with the surrender...

907
01:23:51,163 --> 01:23:53,246
Then there was a gap in things...

908
01:23:53,871 --> 01:23:55,954
 And the whole earth tilted...

909
01:23:56,058 --> 01:23:58,142
 This is the business.This is what we're after.

910
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:00,433
With you inside me...Comes the night...

911
01:24:00,538 --> 01:24:02,204
 ... never again sleep ...

912
01:24:02,413 --> 01:24:03,767
... a monster in the pool ...

913
01:24:04,808 --> 01:24:07,413
 ... Part of the black nature, to board ...

914
01:24:07,413 --> 01:24:09,079
 ... chickens and runnerbeans ...

915
01:24:09,079 --> 01:24:10,121
 ... everywhere I looked ...

916
01:24:10,121 --> 01:24:12,413
 ... sometimes I hate you ...

917
01:24:12,413 --> 01:24:13,454
... Friday ...

918
01:24:13,454 --> 01:24:14,496
 ... I didn't mean that ...

919
01:24:18,142 --> 01:24:19,600
 storm ... years ...... sometimes I hate you ...

920
01:24:30,433 --> 01:24:32,517
... a box of flowers by the bed...

921
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:34,600
 ... I broke your head ...

922
01:24:34,808 --> 01:24:36,892
 ... from the back of the bed ...

923
01:24:36,996 --> 01:24:39,079
 ... the baby died in the morning ...

924
01:24:40,017 --> 01:24:42,100
 ... I gave him a name ...

925
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,163
... His name was Thomas ...

926
01:24:46,683 --> 01:24:48,767
 ...Poor little guy...

927
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,308
... his heart poundslike a voodoo drum ...

928
01:25:33,663 --> 01:25:38,975
My name is Daniel, I'm an addict.I'm clean today, but not for much longer.

929
01:25:39,913 --> 01:25:41,996
Get out.

930
01:25:43,871 --> 01:25:46,996
I suppose I should do just that.

931
01:26:04,913 --> 01:26:06,996
I am in my house Casper.

932
01:28:30,746 --> 01:28:32,829
Promise me you'll stop.

933
01:28:35,954 --> 01:28:38,038
Promise me you'll stop before me.

934
01:29:02,204 --> 01:29:05,329
 can I talk to Dan Cutter,Please? It's Jim Wyatt here.

935
01:29:06,683 --> 01:29:08,767
Yeah Jim, it's me.

936
01:29:08,975 --> 01:29:11,058
Hi! Candy's in the hospital.

937
01:29:12,413 --> 01:29:14,496
What?

938
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:17,933
She's suffered a bit of a nervous breakdown.

939
01:29:36,996 --> 01:29:39,079
It's funny where it all ends up  isn't it?

940
01:30:22,933 --> 01:30:25,017
Candy.

941
01:30:26,892 --> 01:30:28,975
You okay?

942
01:30:50,642 --> 01:30:52,725
I was so frightened.

943
01:30:52,829 --> 01:30:54,913
Sorry.

944
01:30:57,308 --> 01:30:59,392
I didn't really understand what was happening.

945
01:31:06,058 --> 01:31:08,142
Candy?

946
01:31:14,808 --> 01:31:16,892
Everything's dead.

947
01:31:21,579 --> 01:31:23,663
Everything's turning blue.

948
01:31:52,621 --> 01:31:54,704
It's hard through all this you know.

949
01:32:00,017 --> 01:32:03,350
I don't care how wrong you've been living about your years.

950
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:21,788
I care about my daughter.

951
01:32:22,725 --> 01:32:23,767
What?

952
01:32:25,433 --> 01:32:27,517
Whatever you're capable of...whatever she needs...

953
01:32:31,371 --> 01:32:33,454
Come on, we'll take you home.

954
01:33:00,225 --> 01:33:02,308
Let him go.

955
01:34:55,017 --> 01:34:57,100
And that was it...

956
01:34:57,725 --> 01:34:59,808
That was all that was scattered to the winds...

957
01:35:00,850 --> 01:35:02,933
Casper was gone...

958
01:35:03,142 --> 01:35:05,225
 Schumann was lost...

959
01:35:05,642 --> 01:35:08,142
 Candy was off getting better...

960
01:35:08,558 --> 01:35:10,642
 The coast...

961
01:35:10,642 --> 01:35:12,517
 Rehab...

962
01:35:12,517 --> 01:35:13,975
 And I...Was...

963
01:35:13,975 --> 01:35:16,683
I was just...

964
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:18,246
The washer, Dan.

965
01:35:18,246 --> 01:35:19,913
World Championship washer.

966
01:35:20,746 --> 01:35:22,725
One day, you'll wash for Australia.

967
01:35:24,808 --> 01:35:27,725
 The world was full of startling new concepts.

968
01:35:30,329 --> 01:35:34,392
 I couldn't think.I couldn't breathe.

969
01:35:35,433 --> 01:35:37,517
I was waiting for her to come back.

970
01:35:38,558 --> 01:35:40,642
 Because she was everything.

971
01:35:42,621 --> 01:35:44,704
 She was everything to me.

972
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:50,433
Hey Dan, you have a visitor.

973
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:52,933
Visit.

974
01:36:05,017 --> 01:36:07,100
Just Tell her I'm not here.

975
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,454
Are you crazy?

976
01:36:08,558 --> 01:36:10,642
Tell her I knocked off.

977
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:17,204
Your friend is right here, just come.

978
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:30,433
- G'day. - Hey!

979
01:36:38,558 --> 01:36:40,642
I thought it was tomorrow.

980
01:36:42,517 --> 01:36:44,600
I couldn't wait.

981
01:36:46,058 --> 01:36:47,517
Is that okay?

982
01:36:48,038 --> 01:36:50,121
Yeah! No, it's good!

983
01:36:54,288 --> 01:36:56,371
It's just!You look so beautiful.

984
01:36:57,933 --> 01:37:00,017
It's all that country air.

985
01:37:01,788 --> 01:37:03,871
So I finish in an hour.

986
01:38:16,058 --> 01:38:18,142
Dan.

987
01:38:22,725 --> 01:38:28,975
Dan. Hey!Hey!

988
01:38:31,163 --> 01:38:35,433
