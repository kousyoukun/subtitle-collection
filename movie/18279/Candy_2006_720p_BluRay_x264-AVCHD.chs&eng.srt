00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,283
当我初次遇见凯蒂
When I first met Candy

4
00:02:56,638 --> 00:02:58,721
时光如果汁般甜美
Those were like the days of juice..

5
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,471
一切都变得丰富多彩
Everything was bountiful...

6
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,533
鸟儿在天空翱翔
Birds filled the sky ...

7
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:14,658
一股暖流在我们之间流淌
a great kindness float through us...

8
00:03:23,929 --> 00:03:26,013
天堂
Heaven

9
00:03:41,325 --> 00:03:43,408
给你!
Here it is.

10
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:51,325
这次我用你的办法试试
I'm gonna try it your way this time.

11
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,783
坦白说，这办法不错
This is just as good this way. Honestly.

12
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:07,158
Then why don't you do it?
那你怎么还不动手

13
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,158
舒曼，为什么我不动手
Schumann, Why don't I do it?

14
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:16,013
凯蒂，丹只是跟班，不是老大
Dan is a follower, Candy. Not a leader.

15
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:20,492
简单点儿，一直用鼻子吸
We stick to snorting, keep it simple.

16
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:22,367
有时候，你要敢于尝试不同！
You know...Dare to be different!

17
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:26,846
我认为我应该去浴盆试试
Well I think I'd like to try it in the bath.

18
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:30,908
这就是不同
well that's different.

19
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:43,408
凯蒂
Candy?

20
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,450
凯蒂
Candy!

21
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:51,325
舒曼，快来帮我！
Schumann, fucking help me!

22
00:04:51,846 --> 00:04:52,575
怎么了
What??

23
00:04:52,783 --> 00:04:53,408
快来
Come here!

24
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,679
快来！宝贝？
Come here!Babe?

25
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:01,117
噢，天哪
Oh, Christ!

26
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:02,263
该死，她摄入过量了
Shit, I think that she took too much.

27
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:04,763
宝贝
Babe!

28
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,783
快给我些生理盐水或者别的什么东西,我需要生理盐水
Fucking saline solution or something?I need saline solution!

29
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:09,033
什么？
What?

30
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:11,117
我操！赶紧拿杯水来！
Fuck it!Go and get a glass of water...

31
00:05:11,117 --> 00:05:12,888
放盐进去，快！
Put salt in it! Hurry up!

32
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,783
醒醒，宝贝
Come on!Babe!

33
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:19,763
凯蒂，看着我！
Candy! Look at me!

34
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:22,157
放多少盐？
How much salt?

35
00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:22,888
我不知道！看着放吧
I don't know! HEAPS!

36
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,971
快他妈搅啊，确保充分溶解
Just fucking stir it! Make sure it's dissolved!

37
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,992
快来！噢，宝贝！FUCK!
Come here!Oh baby？Fuck!!

38
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:35,075
哥们儿，这有屁用！盐能干啥！
I don't think this works man!What the fuck's salt gonna do?

39
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:36,638
闭嘴！
Shut up!

40
00:05:39,554 --> 00:05:41,533
操！扶着她的胳膊
Fuck!Hold her arm!

41
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,096
你他妈扶着她的胳膊！
Hold her fucking arm, man!

42
00:05:43,096 --> 00:05:45,179
用力！
Harder!

43
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:48,408
这不会...(管用的)
This will not be ...

44
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:48,617
开始吧
Here we go ...

45
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:50,700
不，它完全不起作用，狗屎！
No, it's not gonna fucking work!It's bullshit!!

46
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,638
闭上你的乌鸦嘴
Shut up!

47
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:53,721
叫救护车
Call an ambulance.

48
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:57,992
我们走
Here we go.

49
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,533
凯蒂，看着我
Candy, look at me.

50
00:06:01,742 --> 00:06:03,825
凯蒂！凯蒂！
Candy! Candy!

51
00:06:04,242 --> 00:06:06,325
凯蒂，看着我！
Candy, Look at me!

52
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,617
宝贝
Babe ...

53
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:11,325
带她回来
Bring her back.

54
00:06:11,742 --> 00:06:13,825
...回来
...back.

55
00:06:15,388 --> 00:06:17,471
我他妈已经放了不少盐了
Enough with the fucking salt.

56
00:06:20,492 --> 00:06:22,575
感觉很美妙
It was beautiful.

57
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:25,596
我有点紧张
Intense.

58
00:06:34,554 --> 00:06:36,638
未来飘忽不定
The future or the thing that gleamed.

59
00:06:37,888 --> 00:06:39,971
当下如此美妙
The present was so very, very good.

60
00:06:42,263 --> 00:06:44,346
我从没想过毁去凯蒂的生命
I wasn't trying to wreck Candy's life

61
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:47,158
我努力使自己变得更好
I was trying to make mine better.

62
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,700
我们渴望分享所有一切
We wanted to share absolutely everything.

63
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,763
尤其是最好的
Especially the best bits .

64
00:06:55,283 --> 00:06:57,367
我要永远和你在一起
I want to stay with you forever.

65
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:02,263
谁不想呢？
...and who would'nt!

66
00:07:11,742 --> 00:07:13,825
画的是我俩！
It's us!

67
00:07:16,638 --> 00:07:18,721
我称之为
It's called "The afternoon of extravagant delight. "

68
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:22,263
“狂欢的午后”
By Candy Wyatt.

69
00:07:23,825 --> 00:07:25,908
太美了
It's beautiful.

70
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:28,513
我喜欢这种感觉
I love it!

71
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:32,263
卡斯珀
Casper.

72
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:34,242
卡斯珀，是丹啊
Casper, It's Dan.

73
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:36,429
丹尼尔，等等，我即将带着胜利和祈祷而来
Daniel, hang on!, I'm coming in on a win and a prayer!

74
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:39,033
什么？
What?

75
00:08:39,242 --> 00:08:41,117
我正试着在迪拜降落
I'm trying to land a Jumbo in Dubai.

76
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,158
你秀逗了？
What?

77
00:08:42,263 --> 00:08:45,283
卡斯珀就像你一直想要的父亲
Casper was like the dad you always wanted.

78
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:49,867
他允许你吃糖果和冷饮
The one that lets you have lollies and fizzy drinks

79
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:53,617
他允许你晚归
he lets you stay up late,

80
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,075
允许你晚上一直看电影
and watch movieslate at night.

81
00:08:55,388 --> 00:08:57,471
丹尼尔，你好吗
Daniel, how are you?

82
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,763
卡斯珀和我是多年的朋友
Casper and I went way back.

83
00:08:59,763 --> 00:09:00,492
我爱你（法语）
I love you

84
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:04,867
我说的对吗？
Is that right?

85
00:09:04,971 --> 00:09:05,908
是的
Yes!

86
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,992
这是乔治
This is George.

87
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,283
罕见的英国人，本钱(指男性那话儿)雄厚
A very limited English,but a very large penis.

88
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:13,721
我说的没错吧，乔治
Isn't that right, George?

89
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:15,804
你说是就是吧
Ok.

90
00:09:15,908 --> 00:09:19,554
我们从Lonely Planet 95年出版的哈瓦那旅行指南说起
Our entire conversation is based on the 1995 "Lonely Planet" guide to Havana

91
00:09:21,117 --> 00:09:23,200
请坐
Sit down.

92
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:28,513
都是好朋友嘛
Just good friends.

93
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:32,992
今天有什么安排
So, what's on the agenda today?

94
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:35,804
没啥，我们想四处逛逛
Not much, we're just wandering around.

95
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:41,013
嗯，能不能借给我们50块
Um, Could you spare us $50?

96
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:45,908
凯蒂，他赤裸裸的绝望让你难堪了吗
Does is ever embarrassed you, Candy?...His naked desperation!

97
00:09:45,908 --> 00:09:48,617
裸体，我可以应付
Nakedness, I can deal with!

98
00:09:48,617 --> 00:09:50,700
或者给我们一些迷幻药，我们可以拿去卖吗？
Or give us some ecstasy .we can sell for it?

99
00:09:51,221 --> 00:09:53,304
只怕我作为一名娱乐制药商的
I'm afraid that my days as a manufacturer of ...

100
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:56,429
日子已经到头了
recreational farmaceuticals has come to an end.

101
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,471
为什么呢？
Why's that?

102
00:09:57,575 --> 00:10:00,492
我现在是有机化学副教授了
I've been made Associate Professor of Organic Chemistry.

103
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:02,575
-哇呜！恭喜你！-太棒了！
-Wow! Congratulations. -Great.

104
00:10:02,992 --> 00:10:05,075
因此，我要维护我的声誉
So, suddenly I have a reputation to uphold.

105
00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:08,929
那么既然如此，100块可以不？
Well in that case, could we make it a hundred?

106
00:10:10,388 --> 00:10:12,471
我们会还你的！
We'll pay it back!

107
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:27,054
谢了，卡斯珀
Thanks, Cas.

108
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:29,138
你没事儿吧？
Everything's alright, isn't it?

109
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:33,408
只是现金周转问题，七天而已
It's just a cash flow problem.Only 7 days.

110
00:10:35,492 --> 00:10:37,575
你呢，凯蒂
And you, Candy?

111
00:10:37,575 --> 00:10:40,179
这是条通向死亡的新路！
Being one that's so new to the path of the dead!

112
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:43,513
她很好
She is fine.

113
00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:49,242
当断不断
When you can stop,people don't want to...

114
00:10:49,242 --> 00:10:52,367
必受其乱
... and when you want to stop,You can't!

115
00:10:56,846 --> 00:10:59,554
生命就像筛子
One of life's little riddles!

116
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:02,263
省省吧，老太太
What Grandma?

117
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:04,763
你们可以走了
Off you go!

118
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:06,846
谢谢你，卡斯珀
Thank you, Casper.

119
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:10,492
你好了吗？
Okay, are you ready?

120
00:11:10,492 --> 00:11:12,575
一,二,三...
One, two, three ...

121
00:11:20,283 --> 00:11:23,408
我像《芝麻街》里的角色一样困惑
I feel like some confused Sesame Street character!

122
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,408
开车
Start the car.

123
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,096
我父母很久以前就对我放任自流了
My own parents had long since cut me adrift

124
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:27,679
凯蒂的父母，相反地，管教很严
The Wyatts, on the other hand,kept their firm hold on the ropes.

125
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:31,950
还要土豆吗？
Do you want more potatoes?

126
00:12:32,158 --> 00:12:35,804
我喜欢来这儿，就是为了大饱口福
It was nice to visit places where the fridge was always full.

127
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:43,096
下次来这儿我要带上盘子
I shall have to bring my plate round when I come here!

128
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:47,158
我想你会发现那是部分碳水化合物
I think you'll find that's part of the carbohydrate.

129
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:49,242
你有主意没？
What do you think?

130
00:12:49,554 --> 00:12:54,033
我不知道 我不知道
I don't know.I don't know.

131
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,763
看你怎么做了
See how you go.

132
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:02,992
担架？
Stretchers?

133
00:13:03,513 --> 00:13:06,638
就是在木架子上铺上帆布
They're like wooden frames you stretch the canvass on.

134
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:10,908
不管怎样，我觉得很蠢
and anyway, I feel really stupid ...

135
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:15,075
我大约一个月前做的，我把我们的存款都搭在担架上了
I did about a month ago,and as of tomorrow I'm gonna lose
our deposit on the stretchers.

136
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:20,179
恕我冒昧地问一句
It is really rude to ask ...

137
00:13:22,783 --> 00:13:24,867
至少我不想令她感到惊讶
but at least I won't surprise her!

138
00:13:27,783 --> 00:13:30,908
下次见你我会还钱
I can give you the money back the next time I see you again.

139
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:34,138
你能给他打电话，让他等一个星期吗
Can you ring him, and tell him to wait for a week?

140
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:36,638
上星期我已经很努力地尝试过了
I already tried that pretty much last week.

141
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,033
我给他打电话怎样？
What if I rang him for you?

142
00:13:42,158 --> 00:13:44,242
我没带卡
I haven't got the card with me.

143
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,617
多少钱
How much is it?

144
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,804
150块
150.

145
00:13:50,804 --> 00:13:52,888
不是钱的问题
Mate, the question is not the money.

146
00:13:53,304 --> 00:13:55,388
我非常感激
I really appreciate it.

147
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:59,138
问题是...我女儿的将来
The question...is the future of my daughter.

148
00:14:01,221 --> 00:14:03,304
她简直妙极了
Mate, she's fantastic!

149
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:06,117
你该看看她的画作
Should see her paintings!

150
00:14:06,117 --> 00:14:07,679
问题出在你身上
The question is you.

151
00:14:08,408 --> 00:14:10,492
你打算何时有所作为
When are you gonna do something?

152
00:14:14,138 --> 00:14:16,221
我已经有了主意
I've got some ideas.

153
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:21,429
我给一些热门杂志寄去了我的诗作
I've sent some of my poems into Heat magazine.

154
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:29,033
-咖啡来了!-牛奶...糖，在那儿!
-Here we are! -Milk...and sugar, There!

155
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:31,950
-谢谢你，甜心 -谢谢你，伊莱恩
-Thanks babe! -Thanks, Elaine.

156
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:35,179
你不再是小孩了
You're not a teenager anymore.

157
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,992
你知道这回事，不是吗
You know that, don't you?

158
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:39,033
是的，我知道，吉姆
Yes, I know that, Jim.

159
00:14:43,408 --> 00:14:45,492
所以我不想你做这事儿
that is why I did'nt want you to do it!

160
00:14:45,492 --> 00:14:47,471
别啊，它很好，很棒
No, it's alright! It's fine!

161
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:48,825
你瞅瞅!你把它全弄进奶油里去了!
Look at it!You've turned it into butter!

162
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:51,013
我告诉过你用混的
I told you to keep it on blend!

163
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:53,304
我用的是搅，因为我在搅奶油
I put it on "Whip", because I'm whipping cream!

164
00:14:53,617 --> 00:14:55,700
但是你一窍不通
Yes, but you don't know how to use it.

165
00:14:56,117 --> 00:14:58,200
好吧，你来弄
Right... You do it!!

166
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,533
-呜!!已经太迟了! -啊!很抱歉!
-Uhh!Well it's too late now! -Ah well!! Excuse me!!

167
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,929
所有设置都是相关的，如果你不熟悉它的操作...
Well all these settings are relative,
and if you're not familiar with the workings of the machine ...

168
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:07,783
那这儿为啥写着“搅拌”
Then why the fuck does it say "Whip"?

169
00:15:10,804 --> 00:15:12,888
我要给他们做冰激凌
I'll give them ice cream.

170
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:16,846
别骂骂咧咧的
And please don't swear.

171
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:23,617
好吧!我本打算给你们做冰激凌，现在只能给你们奶油了
Right!Well, I was going to give you cream,
but I'm going to have to give you Ice Cream.

172
00:15:26,221 --> 00:15:28,825
-一切都顺利吗？ -我们活在希望之中
- Everything okay in there? -Well, we live in hope!

173
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:32,367
这是个好居所
A good place to live.

174
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:19,346
去吧!!
Go!!

175
00:16:45,596 --> 00:16:47,679
我不知道这是否？
I wonder if that was it?

176
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:49,971
是否什么？
If that was what?

177
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,783
我们的弹药（指毒品）耗尽了
The last shot.

178
00:16:57,054 --> 00:16:59,138
我不在乎
I wouldn't care.

179
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:28,825
这是祖母留下的
It was my Nana's.

180
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,783
我们不会卖任何东西，我们只是将它典当出去
We're going to sell anything.We're only hocking it!

181
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,283
会赎回来的
We'll get it back!

182
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,825
25块
$25.

183
00:17:58,617 --> 00:18:00,700
他不想要这些画
and He doesn't want the paints.

184
00:18:14,242 --> 00:18:16,325
我会回来的
I'll be back!

185
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:20,075
他说也许我们应该另想办法
He said maybe we could work something out!.

186
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,825
开车
Let's go!

187
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:47,367
是的，我跟他上床了
Yes, I fucked him!

188
00:19:48,617 --> 00:19:50,700
为了50块
For $50.

189
00:19:51,013 --> 00:19:53,096
我真贱!
I stink!

190
00:19:53,617 --> 00:19:55,700
你没问题吧?
You okay?

191
00:19:58,617 --> 00:20:00,700
我很抱歉
I'm Sorry.

192
00:20:00,804 --> 00:20:02,888
别这样!
Don't be!

193
00:20:16,117 --> 00:20:18,721
这是一个无人知晓的深藏已久的秘密
Here is the deepest secret that nobody knows .

194
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:23,200
这颗生命之树，它是根之根,是芽之芽
Here is the root of the root,and the bud of the bud...

195
00:20:23,408 --> 00:20:26,533
是天空的天空
and the sky of the sky,in the tree called life .

196
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,846
它高过灵魂之期盼，不能被思想隐藏
which grows higher than soul can hope, or mind can hide .

197
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:37,783
它是让繁星保持距离的奇迹
and this is the one that is keeping the stars apart.

198
00:20:39,763 --> 00:20:41,846
我把你的心带在身上
I carry your heart.

199
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,971
用我的心将它妥善保藏
I carry it in my heart.

200
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:52,367
你会嫁给我吗
Will you marry me?

201
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,908
我们会成为夫妻
We will be man and wife.

202
00:21:26,742 --> 00:21:28,825
共结连理
One flesh.

203
00:21:32,888 --> 00:21:37,367
你们是否自愿承当婚姻的责任
I will ask them if they freely undertake the obligations of marriage ...

204
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:41,742
并且确定没有法律障碍
... and to state that there is no legal impediment to the marriage.

205
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,325
你们准备好了吗,完全自愿并且没有任何异议地...
Are you ready,freely and without reservation ...

206
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:50,492
把自己献给对方而成就一段美满姻缘
to give yourself to eachother... in marriage?

207
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:53,513
是的，我们准备好了
We are!

208
00:21:54,763 --> 00:21:57,679
你们是否愿意互相敬爱，彼此忠诚
Are you ready for love and honor each other ...

209
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:02,054
相敬如宾，共度余生
as husband and wife, for the rest of your life?

210
00:22:02,992 --> 00:22:05,075
我们愿意!
-We are! -We are!

211
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:07,158
凯蒂，丹尼尔
Candice and Dan ...

212
00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:14,658
回来，亲爱的
Come back, love.

213
00:22:15,283 --> 00:22:16,533
啊，好的
Ah, okay.

214
00:22:17,054 --> 00:22:19,658
大家靠近一点，珍妮，气球往下一点
Alright everyone, Close together! Balloons down, Jenny.

215

大家笑一笑!大喜的日子!

216

一，二...哇靠

217
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:25,388
舒曼!

218
00:22:25,388 --> 00:22:28,617
-一，二...三! -好...
-One, two... Three! -Right...

219
00:22:28,617 --> 00:22:31,950
大家不去吃点儿喝点儿？
Alright everyone! Back to our place for a few drinks,and a bite to eat?

220
00:22:32,888 --> 00:22:35,492
很抱歉，我必须走了，我有个约会
I'm sorry, I'm going to have to go,I've got an appointment!

221
00:22:35,492 --> 00:22:38,096
哦，好吧，希望其他人没有约会
Oh! Well, I hope that nobody else has got an appointment!

222
00:22:38,408 --> 00:22:40,492
怀亚特夫人，我可是期待很久了
I'm in for the long hall, Mrs. Wyatt.

223
00:22:40,908 --> 00:22:41,950
很好
Good.

224
00:22:42,575 --> 00:22:44,138
不，我恨拼写
No, I hate spelling!

225
00:22:44,138 --> 00:22:46,013
我也是!最恨拼写和数学!
Yeah, me too! Spelling and maths!

226
00:22:46,013 --> 00:22:48,304
我一直对拼写和数学深恶痛绝
I was always hopeless at spelling and maths.

227
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,492
-我喜欢英文 -英文?
-I like English. -English?

228
00:22:50,492 --> 00:22:51,533
就像故事之类？
Like stories and stuff?

229
00:22:51,742 --> 00:22:52,783
Yeah!

230
00:22:52,783 --> 00:22:54,346
英文和体育!
English and Sport!

231
00:22:54,346 --> 00:22:55,179
那你可不能行差踏错
Well you can't go wrong there.

232
00:22:55,388 --> 00:22:56,846
你可以做体育记者
You can be a Sports journalist.

233
00:22:56,846 --> 00:22:57,575
真的吗
Really?

234
00:22:57,575 --> 00:22:58,617
我一看你就是当体育记者的料
I could see you as a sports journalist.

235
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:01,013
好嘛，丹尼尔，你真可笑
Well, Dan, you're laughing mate!

236
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:03,096
帮帮这对小夫妻吧
Financing this love as a married couple.

237
00:23:03,721 --> 00:23:06,325
你已经得到了你最想要的，你为它付出了你的一切
You get the first one under your belt,
you pour everything into it.

238
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,033
毕竟，你要的并没有低于你的最低期望
After that, the minimum equity is what you're after.

239
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,950
你现在负债累累
You get into as much debt as possible.

240
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:14,242
婚姻可使你更专注一些
It gives you some focus.

241
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:17,783
我不仅仅在说不动产
I'm not just talking about real estate.

242
00:23:17,783 --> 00:23:20,596
我还在跟你讨论生活的哲学
I'm talking about a philosophy.

243
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,888
不好意思，打扰一下
Would you mind...if you excuse me for a minute?

244
00:23:22,888 --> 00:23:23,929
请便!
No! Sure!!

245
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:29,867
你和丹去打算哪儿度蜜月?

246
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,158
-需要柠檬水吗? -谢谢!

247
00:23:35,075 --> 00:23:36,950
你太紧张了!明年升中学了吗?
You're so tight! You're selling next year?

248
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:40,596
阿波茨路!就在我们附近!
Abbots Road! It's just round the corner from us!

249
00:23:40,908 --> 00:23:42,888
天哪,那会有所不同的，嗯?
Geez, that'll be a change, eh?

250
00:23:42,992 --> 00:23:46,325
耶，我想读州立学校，但是我父母...
Yeah, I'd rather go to a state school,but, it's mom and dad...

251
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:49,554
珍妮,过来帮我弄三明治
Jenny, could you come and help with sanwiches

252
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:51,221
我也来帮手,凯珀阿姨
I'll give you a hand too, Auntie Cap!

253
00:23:57,054 --> 00:23:59,658
-咋了? -你们在那儿干嘛?
- What? - What are you doing in there?

254
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:01,950
没干什么
Doing a shit.

255
00:24:02,263 --> 00:24:04,346
你小子有鬼!
No you're not!

256
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:09,138
开门
Open the door.

257
00:24:09,138 --> 00:24:11,117
不行!
I can't!

258
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:14,658
你这贪婪的杂碎
You greedy fuckup!!

259
00:24:16,325 --> 00:24:18,408
结婚是个相当自私的选择
Rather a selfish way to begin a marriage!

260
00:24:19,138 --> 00:24:21,221
真的！全完了！
Really! All done!

261
00:24:24,242 --> 00:24:25,283
蠢货！
Dick!

262
00:24:25,283 --> 00:24:27,263
显然，这是属于瘾君子的周末！
Obviously, it was a big dope weekend!

263
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:31,117
谁不想在自己的婚礼上放松
You wanna be relaxed at your own wedding.

264
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,263
-对此我很抱歉 -这没什么
-Sorry about that. -That's fine!

265
00:24:43,096 --> 00:24:45,179
我们说到哪儿了？
So where were we?

266
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:46,013
我说了，你应该尝试...
I was saying, you need to get your t...

267
00:24:46,325 --> 00:24:48,408
你不坐吗？请坐吧！
Do you need a seat? Yeah, sure! Have a seat!

268
00:24:49,242 --> 00:24:51,325
吉姆，你该了解市场
You need to get your toe in the the market, Jim!

269
00:24:51,846 --> 00:24:53,929
你明白我的意思吗？住到远郊，很好！
You know what I'mn saying? Out of suburbs, fine!

270
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,533
两间卧房...
Two bedroom...

271
00:24:56,638 --> 00:24:58,096
你们不需要带花园庭院吗？
...You don't need a garden courtyard, do you?

272
00:24:58,513 --> 00:25:00,596
你竟然在最棒的街区住最差的房子！
You want the worst house, in the best street!

273
00:25:02,575 --> 00:25:04,554
你们需要厨房或者浴室吧...
You don't need a kitchen or bathroom...

274
00:25:04,554 --> 00:25:06,117
再说吧！
Put it in later!

275
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:08,304
比方说，你要借...
Say for example, you want to borrow ...

276
00:25:08,304 --> 00:25:09,763
400块
400.

277
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:14,138
或者300
Or 300

278
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:24,867
你想借钱...你内心争斗...
You do it...You Struggle...

279
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:26,950
你的明白？
Understand?

280
00:25:27,054 --> 00:25:28,304
丹？
Dan?

281
00:25:28,825 --> 00:25:30,908
丹？
Dan?

282
00:25:31,325 --> 00:25:33,408
丹！
Dan!

283
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:36,013
丹...
Dan...

284
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:38,617
醒醒
Wake up.

285
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:40,804
丹，丹，醒醒
Dan, Dan, wake up.

286
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:44,554
我惨了
I'm fucked.

287
00:25:45,283 --> 00:25:47,367
他喝了太多的香槟
Too much champagne.

288
00:25:47,575 --> 00:25:49,658
我...我可以肯定
Yeah I'm...I'm sure it's that...

289
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,888
这是个大日子
Well, it is the big day!

290
00:25:52,888 --> 00:25:54,971
我煮点儿咖啡
I'll make some coffee.

291
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,221
他醉了！
He's drunk!

292
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,283
你想和我谈些什么吗？
Is there anything you want to talk to me about?

293
00:26:10,492 --> 00:26:12,575
什么？
What?

294
00:26:12,575 --> 00:26:14,033
发生什么事了？
What's going on?

295
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:15,700
妈，你知道的！
Mum, you know what's going on!

296
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,846
我们要享受一段美好时光
We are having a lovely time!

297
00:26:16,846 --> 00:26:18,929
我不是那个意思
That's not what I meant.

298
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:22,054
那么，我就不知道你什么意思了
Well then, I don't know what you mean!

299
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:25,388
丹咋了？
What's wrong with Dan?

300
00:26:25,388 --> 00:26:29,242
他醉了，妈妈，他没什么
He's just pissed, Mum!He's hopeless!!

301
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,783
对不起
Sorry.

302
00:26:32,783 --> 00:26:34,867
谢谢你们的盛情款待
Thanks for the beautiful reception.

303
00:26:38,617 --> 00:26:41,742
你要知道，那会气死你父亲的
It'd kill your father, you know.

304
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,867
你不认为我们应该戒掉吗
Think we should stop?

305
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:03,513
-什么？难道我们不够体面吗？-是的，很体面！
-What? Now that we're respectable? -Yeah, I know!

306
00:27:06,846 --> 00:27:08,929
你知道我的意思
You know what I mean.

307
00:27:09,658 --> 00:27:11,742
任何时候你说的“戒”这个词，我都明白
Whenever you say the word.

308
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,158
我们是麦当劳里最酷的人
We are the coolest people in McDonalds!

309
00:27:27,992 --> 00:27:30,075
我们有很多优点
We had a lot going for us.

310
00:27:31,742 --> 00:27:36,117
我们发现了将一切聚合起来的秘诀
We'd found the secret glue that held all things together

311
00:27:38,096 --> 00:27:40,179
在一个没有噪音的
in a perfect place...

312
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,367
完美之地
...where the noise did not intrude.

313
00:27:46,325 --> 00:27:50,388
我们的世界是如此...完整
Our world was...so very complete.

314
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,346
大地
Earth

315
00:28:12,471 --> 00:28:14,554
-嘿，宝贝！-嗨！
-Hey baby! -Hi!

316
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:16,950
它怎么样？
How was it?

317
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,513
都差不多
About the same.

318
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:20,388
给你200块
Here's $200.

319
00:28:20,388 --> 00:28:22,054
我大概需要半个钟头
I'm gonna give it half an hour and then I'll split!

320
00:28:22,054 --> 00:28:24,033
耶，我不会太久，家里见
Yeah. I won't be long.I'll meet you at home.

321
00:28:24,138 --> 00:28:25,179
好的，家里见
Ok, I see you there.

322
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,783
好的
OK.

323
00:28:29,554 --> 00:28:32,054
有人说，用不了十年你就会成为一名吸毒者
They say that for every 10 years you've been a junkie ...

324
00:28:32,158 --> 00:28:35,388
你会花七年等待
You will have spent 7 of them...waiting.

325
00:28:37,158 --> 00:28:40,908
一边花同样的时间思考
One way is not bad have as much time to think .

326
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:45,179
一边忍受着工作的苦闷
on the other, the anxiety was a full time job!

327
00:28:59,033 --> 00:29:01,117
-嘿？-你这个贱人！
- Hey? - You slimey cunt!

328
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,763
-咋了？-你他妈怎么看这事儿？
- What?  - What do you fucking reckon?

329
00:29:04,763 --> 00:29:06,846
我只是稍微快了点儿，啥也没有
I just had a quick little bit! It was nothing!

330
00:29:07,158 --> 00:29:08,721
哪里？
Where?

331
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:10,283
唔，公园。我遇见安吉的时候
Um, In the park. When I met Ange.

332
00:29:10,283 --> 00:29:11,846
安吉拉和你一起那啥了？
Did Angela do it with you?

333
00:29:11,846 --> 00:29:13,929
没，当然没，我们交易完就离开了
No, of course not!
We left as soon as we did the deal!

334
00:29:14,658 --> 00:29:17,367
他可以体面地回家见他女友.你本来也可以！
Only because he's decent enough to go home to his girlfriend.
Like you should be!

335
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:21,013
哦，凯蒂！他卖我大麻！为啥他总想着在公共厕所里备受欢迎？
Oh candy! He sold me the dope! Why would he want to have a hit
in the public toilet?

336
00:29:21,325 --> 00:29:23,408
那你他妈也这么想？
Well why the fuck would you?

337
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:28,825
哇呜！听着，我承认这很蠢！
Oww!Look, I admit it was dumb!

338
00:29:28,825 --> 00:29:30,908
你满意了？
Okay?

339
00:29:30,908 --> 00:29:31,950
我很遗憾！
I'm Sorry!

340
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,033
让我给你尝点儿甜头吧！
Will you let me make you a nice taste!

341
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:35,075
白痴，我讨厌这样！
I'm getting sick of this, dickhead!

342
00:29:35,075 --> 00:29:36,117
你的问题出在哪儿？
What is your problem?

343
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:37,575
你就是我的问题！
You are my problem!

344
00:29:37,783 --> 00:29:39,242
你的存在简直是在浪费空间
You are a waste of space.

345
00:29:42,471 --> 00:29:44,138
你找到了自己的人生或其他什么吗？
Are you getting your period or something?

346
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:45,283
没有，丹！
No, Dan.

347
00:29:45,388 --> 00:29:47,054
我再也没有自己的人生了！
I hardly have my period anymore!

348
00:29:47,158 --> 00:29:48,721
因为我的身体已经沉沦了！
...because my body's all fucked up!

349
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:51,221
是你把我带进这个该死的梦靥
It's this fucking nightmare you've led me into!

350
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:53,408
哦，是吗？我有拿枪指着你的头让你吸毒吗？
Oh right! Like I held a gun to your head! Did I? Eh??

351
00:29:54,658 --> 00:29:56,742
我有逼你这么做吗？
Held you down, hit you up, did I?

352
00:29:57,367 --> 00:29:58,408
操你大爷！
Fuck You!

353
00:29:58,825 --> 00:30:00,075
操你妈的，凯蒂！
Fuck you too, Candy!

354
00:30:00,804 --> 00:30:02,888
那好，我操你全家！
Well, Fuck you double then!

355
00:30:32,783 --> 00:30:36,117
丹，你发现没有，我越认真，画得越差
Dan, have you noticed, the more I work, the less I paint?

356
00:30:38,096 --> 00:30:40,492
凯蒂，我不想争吵！
Candy, I don't want a fight! OK?

357
00:30:41,221 --> 00:30:43,617
我就是不明白今晚你是怎么了！我是说...
I just don't see what your problem is tonight! I mean...

358
00:30:45,492 --> 00:30:47,575
我们一起生活！
We've got a life!

359
00:30:47,575 --> 00:30:49,554
这没有什么好坏之分！
It's neither good nor bad! OK?

360
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:55,492
你知道...你知道我在做什么吗？
Do you know... Do you know what I do?

361
00:30:56,846 --> 00:30:58,825
仔细听着，蠢货！
Listen to this, dick fuck!

362
00:30:58,825 --> 00:31:00,804
我整天都在干嘛？
What do I do all day?

363
00:31:00,908 --> 00:31:02,575
我恨我现在的境况！
I fuck men I hate!

364
00:31:02,992 --> 00:31:04,971
-别这样  -我该怎么办？
-Don't do this. -What are going to do about it?

365
00:31:05,075 --> 00:31:06,742
看这，就靠这个！不是吗？
Look, Okay, that's it! Alright?

366
00:31:06,846 --> 00:31:08,929
没有妓院，没有陪伴！
No more brothels, No more escorts!

367
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:11,013
-我们正开始崭新的生活！ -你根本不懂
-We're gonna take the time to start a new life!
-You don't understand do you?

368
00:31:11,117 --> 00:31:13,200
这就是我们的新生活，过去的让它过去吧
That's really it this time.That's going away!

369
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,075
或许我想继续
Maybe I want to keep using!

370
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:17,158
你知道，我讨厌工作，是的，但是
You know, I'm sick of working,yes,but...

371
00:31:17,158 --> 00:31:19,242
假如我要继续吸毒，你会怎么办？
...What if I want to keep using?
What are you gonna do about it?

372
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,492
凯蒂！
Candy!

373
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,575
你怎么不去找个同性恋
Why don't you ring gay blokes?

374
00:31:23,513 --> 00:31:25,388
你开始工作！你去卖自己的屁股！
You start working!You hock your ass!

375
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:27,575
嘿，你不可以这么做
Hey, you know you can not do that!

376
00:31:28,617 --> 00:31:30,700
你想想，我会...我会得艾滋！
You know, I'll get...I'll get AIDS!

377
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,575
你不会，白痴！
No you won't, you moron!

378
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:34,867
你可以跟所有人一样用避孕套
You'll make them use condoms,like everybody else!

379
00:31:35,075 --> 00:31:37,054
我不知道怎么办
I wouldn't know what to do.

380
00:31:37,054 --> 00:31:40,492
你是异性恋，对吧？你只要做你擅长的事情就行了
You're heterosexual, right? So you're
just doing what you're good at anyway.

381
00:31:40,492 --> 00:31:41,742
你知道自己在说什么吗？
Did you even hear what you're saying?

382
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:42,783
让我去干女人，没问题！
Let me fuck women, no problems!

383
00:31:42,783 --> 00:31:47,367
如果我干女人可以来钱，我保证你不用工作
If I can do it with women, I'd make us all the money!
You'd never have to work, I swear!

384
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:49,450
但是...这些女人不是喜欢肌肉男吗？
But... These women, they want muscle types, don't they?

385
00:31:50,804 --> 00:31:53,304
如果做鸭有市场，我乐意做，但是我不认为有市场
If there was a market out there, I'd do it, but I don't think there is!

386
00:31:53,304 --> 00:31:54,763
而且你要知道，我不可能成为同性恋
And I'd be hopeless with the gay stuff!You know that!

387
00:31:55,492 --> 00:31:56,742
你他妈的真令人难以置信
You're fucking unbeleivable!

388
00:32:14,138 --> 00:32:16,221
开着电视我睡不着
I can't get to sleep with that on.

389
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:18,617
你能关了它吗？
Can you turn it off?

390
00:32:19,033 --> 00:32:21,117
凯蒂，这的确是部优秀的影片
Candy, it's a really good movie!

391
00:32:21,846 --> 00:32:23,929
我把声音调小一点，可以吗？
I'll turn it down, okay?

392
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:33,825
不管怎样，半小时就结束了
Anyway, it finishes in half an hour.

393
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:36,429
去你妈的！
Fuck you!

394
00:32:37,471 --> 00:32:39,554
上床！
Go to bed.

395
00:32:41,117 --> 00:32:43,200
听到没有？
How can you even hear that?

396
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,867
光线干扰到我了！
The light's bugging me!

397
00:32:59,033 --> 00:33:01,117
我无法相信
I can't believe it.

398
00:33:01,117 --> 00:33:02,783
我真他妈难以相信
I can't fucking believe it.

399
00:33:03,304 --> 00:33:05,388
有怎么了？我没发出任何动静
What? I'm not making any noise.

400
00:33:06,325 --> 00:33:08,408
是光！
The light!

401
00:33:08,825 --> 00:33:10,908
有光我睡不着！
The Light's keeping me awake.

402
00:33:11,013 --> 00:33:13,096
好吧，我把光遮起来，行了吗？
OK, look! I'll cover the light!Hmm??

403
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:18,408
这样光线就没那么强了！
There's more light coming from the workshop than that!

404
00:33:18,513 --> 00:33:20,596
混蛋！
Asshole!

405
00:33:27,158 --> 00:33:30,283
笔！我听见笔划过纸的声音！
The pen!! I can hear the pen scratching on the paper!

406
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,783
这太荒谬了，凯蒂！
How? This is ridiculous, Candy.

407
00:33:32,783 --> 00:33:35,388
你在找借口！
You're just looking for an excuse!

408
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:37,888
关灯上床！
Turn off the light and come to bed.

409
00:33:37,888 --> 00:33:39,763
我不想再和你讨论这件事
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore!

410
00:33:39,763 --> 00:33:41,013
关灯！
Turn the light off!

411
00:33:41,013 --> 00:33:42,575
不！我也不想跟你说！
Nope! I'm not even talking to you!

412
00:33:42,575 --> 00:33:44,033
-关上这该死的灯 -啊哈！
-TURN THE FUCKING LIGHT OFF!! -...Aghhh!

413
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,783
我操！

我不是故意伤到你的...

西瓜，香蕉，你的大巴拉!

420
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,950
可以用吗啡吗？
Is there any chance for some morphine?

421
00:34:08,408 --> 00:34:10,492
我很疼
I'm in a fair bit of pain.

422
00:34:13,513 --> 00:34:15,283
我不觉得你需要吗啡

我觉得你不太疼

值得一试啊！
Oh well, it was worth a try!

425
00:34:28,304 --> 00:34:31,846

451
00:37:06,533 --> 00:37:10,908

他游手好闲!

458
00:37:35,908 --> 00:37:37,992

当日子变得艰难

不是我自夸，我花了一个小时来配药
An honour student didn't show, so I had an idle hour to fill.

470
00:38:19,971 --> 00:38:22,054
你做这个用了一个小时
You made that in an hour?

Well... Panadine to morphine,in about an hour and 10!

472

如果你有扑热息痛
If you get rid of the paracetamol...

473
00:38:29,658 --> 00:38:31,221
你知道怎么做

我没什么想跟你说的！

491
00:40:24,658 --> 00:40:27,158
他们希望你做什么？

公园里有一大堆同性恋！

If they pay you, would they expect you to have a stiffie?

496
00:40:45,283 --> 00:40:47,367
勃起的阴茎会有用的

497
00:40:50,388 --> 00:40:53,617
我不认为我能那样做
I don't think I could manage that.

I just... I was after some money,

You know, I saw the wallet on the seat,
and I took it! I wasn't thinking!

519
00:43:02,888 --> 00:43:04,867
我对你的信用卡没有任何兴趣
And I'm not interested in your credit cards.

520
00:43:04,867 --> 00:43:07,679
我只是想做对的事，把钱包还给你
I just want to do the right thing and give it back to you.

521
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,325

Imagine if you'd turned your powers

Does this look like me?

542
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,283
一点儿也不
Not even remotely.

...How about now?

546
00:44:42,783 --> 00:44:44,867
戴眼镜的白种人
Caucasian man with glasses.

547
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:47,679
棒极了~
Yes!

548
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:55,804
我觉得自己像人猿泰山
I felt like Tarzan,at fuckin' last!

549
00:44:55,804 --> 00:44:58,721
我得去为“简”（指凯蒂）猎取食物了
I had to hunt down some food for Jane.

550
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:02,679
我知道我该胆大妄为一回了
I knew it was in my power to do something brave.

551
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:56,533
是的...
Yeah...

552
00:45:56,533 --> 00:45:58,617
你回办公室后，我们可以谈谈吗？
Can we talk about this when you get back to the office?

553
00:45:58,617 --> 00:46:00,908
20分钟之后...好的，再见！
20 minutes... Okay, bye!

554
00:46:00,908 --> 00:46:02,888
很抱歉！
Sorry about that!

555
00:46:02,888 --> 00:46:04,242
早上好，你好吗？
Good morning,How are you?

556
00:46:04,242 --> 00:46:05,908
很好，你好吗？
Ah, good!How are you?

557
00:46:05,908 --> 00:46:07,575
还好
Good.

558
00:46:07,575 --> 00:46:10,179
我是想核对一下余额
I just uh, wanted to check my
current balance on this please!

559
00:46:10,179 --> 00:46:12,888
好的，输一下你的个人识别号
Okay, I'll just need to get you to
enter in your PIN...

560
00:46:16,013 --> 00:46:18,096
哦，天哪，我..感觉糟透了
Oh God, I'm...terrible with this!

561
00:46:18,096 --> 00:46:22,158
天哪！你有过记不住个人识别号的困扰吗？
God! Do you ever have trouble remembering your PIN?

562
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:26,013
对于记不住数字的人你确实该感到惊讶
You'd be surprised at the number of
people who forget them.

563
00:46:26,013 --> 00:46:28,617
我知道，所以我进来...
Yeah I know! That's why I came inside...

564
00:46:28,617 --> 00:46:30,596
我在ATM机外面记不住密码，我想...
Because I couldn't remember it
out at the ATM, and I thought...

565
00:46:30,596 --> 00:46:33,408
如果我有身份证，我可以，呃...
You know I could just er..If I had ID?

566
00:46:33,408 --> 00:46:38,513
不！很抱歉，你需要个人识别号来交易
No! I'm sorry, you need your PIN number for all transactions. It's...

567
00:46:38,513 --> 00:46:40,283
这是安全保障之一
It's one of those security things!

568
00:46:40,283 --> 00:46:42,471
是的，当然，当然，我理解
No! Of course, of course!I understand. Um...

569
00:46:43,721 --> 00:46:45,804
你不能通融一下..
So you can't just...

570
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:47,471
我真的不能！
I really can't!

571
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:53,513
喂？

576
00:47:06,117 --> 00:47:11,221
在过去的24小时我们留意到您信用卡的一些非正常的交易
We've been tracking some unusual activity on
your credit card, in the last 24 hours...

577
00:47:11,221 --> 00:47:12,263
哦，不！

578
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:14,867
您最后一次使用主卡是在什么时候？
When was the last time you used your Master Card?

579
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:19,242

Um, look! I think my wallet was stolen last night...

580
00:47:19,242 --> 00:47:21,950
您报失了吗？
Did you report it missing?

581
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,283
我正在打电话报失！
I was just calling now!

582
00:47:25,283 --> 00:47:26,846
但这是我给您打的电话
<i> But I called you. </ i>

583
00:47:26,846 --> 00:47:28,617
我是说我正要给你们打电话
Um, I mean I was about to call.

584
00:47:29,242 --> 00:47:34,242
莫伊兰先生，我要核对一下您的详细信息
Sir, Mr. Moylan, I'm going to have to
verify your details for a security check.

585
00:47:34,242 --> 00:47:36,429
可以告诉我您的出生日期吗？
Would you please tell me your
Date of Birth?

00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:39,450

Um... 13th of March, 1977.

587
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:41,950
您母亲的姓氏是？
Mother's Maiden Name?

588
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,929
呃，林奇
Er, Lynch.

589
00:47:44,138 --> 00:47:45,492
您的安全号码？
Number of security?

590
00:47:45,492 --> 00:47:49,658
是个人识别号吗？
Is that like your PIN number?

591
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:54,033
不一定...但一般都是！
Well, it shouldn't be...but you often find that it is!

592
00:47:54,033 --> 00:47:59,867
嗯...试试3279
Umm...Try... 3279

593
00:47:59,867 --> 00:48:01,846
3279

594
00:48:16,325 --> 00:48:19,971
某些日子，你会忘记所有的事情
It's just one of those days, you know...
where everythings just gone!

595
00:48:19,971 --> 00:48:22,263
常有的事！
It happens all the time!

596
00:48:22,263 --> 00:48:25,388
嗯，听着...我已经取到每日限额
Um, but listen... I've already got my daily limit out from the ATM outside...

597
00:48:25,388 --> 00:48:29,554
但是我需要更多，我想买下一辆老式的梅赛德斯
...But I actually need more, because
I'm trying to buy this beautiful old Mercedes....

598
00:48:29,554 --> 00:48:31,221
奶油色的，你知道的，TLS？
...you know, the cream ones,you know, the TLS?

599
00:48:31,221 --> 00:48:33,721
话说回来，那些人总是要收现金
Anyway, the guy's willing to negotiate for cash...

600
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,783
2247块
...$2247.

601
00:48:43,408 --> 00:48:45,492
天哪，我们成穷光蛋了
God, we're going to be in the poor house!

602
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,783
50分！
...and 50 cents.

603
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,700
千万别对一辆车动感情！
Never get sentimental about a car!

604
00:48:55,283 --> 00:48:58,825
我本来要你查一下这张卡的可用额度...
I might just get you to check the
available credit on this card...

605
00:49:00,283 --> 00:49:02,367
我可以取现吗？
I can get a cash advance, can't I?

606
00:49:05,388 --> 00:49:07,471
凯蒂？凯蒂！
Candy? Candy!

607
00:49:07,471 --> 00:49:09,554
我做到了，我他妈做到了，宝贝！
I did it! I did it! I fucking did it, baby!

608
00:49:11,325 --> 00:49:13,408
我他妈真的做到了！
I fucking did it!

609
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:16,325
天，你会为此爱死我的！
God, You... are going to fucking LOVE me for this...

610
00:49:16,325 --> 00:49:18,200
7千块！
7 Grand!!

611
00:49:18,408 --> 00:49:20,596
天！你该看看它！我太伟大了，它就像...
Oh god! You should have seen it!
I was fucking great! It was like...

612
00:49:21,117 --> 00:49:23,200
就像那部电影
It was like that movie we saw with that...

613
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:27,054
天，他叫啥来着，那个我们喜欢的演员？
God, what was his name,that actor we like?

614
00:49:27,054 --> 00:49:28,825
他得到了所有的钱，他简直酷毙了 -丹尼！
...and he gets all that money,and he walks in and he's all coool,
and stuf like that... -Danny!

615
00:49:28,825 --> 00:49:37,158
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

616
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:40,492
糟糕
Shit.

617
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:55,492
凯蒂
Candy.

618
00:49:55,596 --> 00:49:57,679
垃圾
Crap.

619
00:49:59,658 --> 00:50:01,013
这不可能..呃..
It couldn't be, uh...

620
00:50:05,804 --> 00:50:06,846
不
No.

621
00:50:07,158 --> 00:50:09,242
我们从没弄破安全套啊！
We never broke a condom.

622
00:50:10,388 --> 00:50:12,471
我早就知道
I'd know.

623
00:50:13,096 --> 00:50:15,179
是我弄伤你头的那晚
It was the night I broke your skull.

624
00:50:17,575 --> 00:50:19,658
太疯狂了
How fucking weird.

625
00:50:20,075 --> 00:50:22,158
一晚就怀上了
One night.

626
00:50:25,908 --> 00:50:27,992
我可以去做人流
I can get an abortion.

627
00:50:29,658 --> 00:50:30,908
不行
No.

628
00:50:31,325 --> 00:50:33,408
不，不行！
No, no way!

629
00:50:33,721 --> 00:50:35,804
可以的
This is good.

630
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:38,408
这是注定的
It was meant to be.

631
00:50:39,138 --> 00:50:41,221
这正是我们需要的
This is what we need.

632
00:50:43,408 --> 00:50:45,492
我们必须戒毒了
We've got to stop using.

633
00:50:50,075 --> 00:50:51,325
是的
Yeah.

634
00:50:53,825 --> 00:50:55,075
是的，当然
Yeah, of course.

635
00:51:03,617 --> 00:51:04,867
要糖吗？
Sugar?

636
00:51:06,325 --> 00:51:07,575
两勺
Two, please.

637
00:51:10,075 --> 00:51:12,158
我们要告诉所有人
We've got some news everybody...

638
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:17,367
我们有孩子了
We're having a baby.

639
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:26,638
啊，亲爱的
Ah, Darling!

640
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:11,475
凯蒂甜心，太棒了
Candice, Good God.

641
00:52:17,621 --> 00:52:21,788
我们必须明确一些事情
We just wanted you to know that
we've made some decisions. and uh...

642
00:52:22,517 --> 00:52:24,600
我们预留一部分钱出来养孩子
We've been putting some money aside,haven't we?

643
00:52:25,329 --> 00:52:27,621
我们要离开这个"仓库"
We're going to get out of that
whole warehouse environment.

644
00:52:27,933 --> 00:52:29,808
住进更适合居住的房子
...and live in a proper house.

645
00:52:30,121 --> 00:52:32,100
是的，我们要在一个真正的“家”中
Yeah! We really want to raise our child in the....

646
00:52:32,933 --> 00:52:35,433
...将孩子养大
...in a proper home.

647
00:52:36,371 --> 00:52:38,454
你告诉你的父母了吗？
Have you told your parents?

648
00:52:40,642 --> 00:52:42,204
没有
No.

649
00:52:45,642 --> 00:52:47,725
第一天
Day 1

650
00:52:51,475 --> 00:52:53,558
我们知道我们要做什么
We knew what we had to do.

651
00:52:55,017 --> 00:52:57,933
有很多计划搁浅
It takes alot of planning to stop.

652
00:53:02,725 --> 00:53:04,808
上天保佑！我们一定可以做到，凯蒂！
Lucky at last!We can really do this, Candy.

653
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:08,558
虽然会很艰难，但是...
It's going to be hard, but...

654
00:53:10,746 --> 00:53:12,829
就像一座桥
I'm sure it's like a bridge...

655
00:53:13,975 --> 00:53:16,475
只要我们走过它，一切都会好起来
And once we cross it,everything will be okay.

656
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:20,433
你可以继续画画了...
You can get back into your painting again...

657
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:22,933
也许我们该搬到乡下去...
Maybe we'll move to the country...

658
00:53:23,142 --> 00:53:25,225
种一点蔬菜...
Grow some veggies...

659
00:53:25,225 --> 00:53:26,683
养几只鸡...
Feed the chickens...

660
00:53:29,183 --> 00:53:31,267
我们应该搬到泰国...
We could go live in Thailand...

661
00:53:36,475 --> 00:53:39,288
泰国很好，只要我们不吸毒的话
Thailand would be great,if we didn't use.

662
00:53:40,329 --> 00:53:42,413
或者去喜马拉雅山
Or the Himalayas.

663
00:53:44,183 --> 00:53:46,267
我们将坐上独木舟
We'll go canoeing...

664
00:53:46,371 --> 00:53:48,454
在白色的浪花上漂流
A bit of white water rafting...

665
00:53:53,142 --> 00:53:56,683
积极健康，甜美入睡
Get healthy, sleep well...

666
00:53:57,308 --> 00:53:59,913
不用再受毒品的控制
...not have drugs in our system.

667
00:54:01,788 --> 00:54:03,871
那样该有多好？
How good would that be?

668
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,579
我们必须戒毒
We really have to do this.

669
00:54:13,767 --> 00:54:15,850
我们这次一定要做到
We have to do it this time.

670
00:54:16,267 --> 00:54:18,350
是的，我们会的
Yeah, we will.

671
00:54:19,392 --> 00:54:21,475
我们
We are.

672
00:54:22,933 --> 00:54:25,017
我们正在努力
We're really fuckin' doing it!

673
00:55:30,329 --> 00:55:32,413
第二天
Day 2

674
00:58:47,725 --> 00:58:49,808
第四天
Day 4

675
00:58:57,517 --> 00:58:59,600
我受不了了
I can't do it.

676
00:59:00,225 --> 00:59:02,308
我忍不住了
I can't do it.

677
00:59:02,308 --> 00:59:04,704
嘿！回床上来！
Hey!Come back to bed.

678
00:59:04,913 --> 00:59:06,996
你会着凉的
Alright? You'll catch a cold.

679
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,163
卡斯珀，是我，凯蒂
Casper, It's Candy.

680
00:59:36,163 --> 00:59:37,933
你拿到货马上给我电话
Ring me as soon as you get this.

681
00:59:38,142 --> 00:59:40,225
我们打过你手机
We've tried your mobile.

682
00:59:43,142 --> 00:59:46,267
我知道我说过一旦我们要货你就不理我们但是...
I know we said to ignore us while we did this, but...

683
00:59:46,267 --> 00:59:47,829
三天了...
3 days...

684
00:59:50,538 --> 00:59:52,829
...我们已经很出色了，但是我们现在感觉不是很好
...we did pretty well, but we're not feeling so great now.

685
00:59:52,829 --> 00:59:55,329
我们现在很需要你
We don't want you to ignore us now.

686
00:59:57,204 --> 00:59:59,288
你在吗？
Are you there?

687
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:02,933
在就说话
Pick up if you're there.

688
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:06,163
说话呀！
Pick up!

689
01:00:08,975 --> 01:00:11,058
好吧，你不在
Okay, you're not there.

690
01:00:11,058 --> 01:00:12,725
给我们电话
Call us!!

691
01:00:12,725 --> 01:00:13,975
妈的！妈的！
Shit! Shit!

692
01:00:15,017 --> 01:00:16,058
Shit! Shit! Shit!

693
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,183
科杰克吗？我是凯蒂啊！
Kojak? It's Candy!

694
01:00:27,933 --> 01:00:29,288
嗯...妈的，很不好
Um... Shit, not so good.

695
01:00:31,475 --> 01:00:32,517
我很痛苦，我的意思是
I'm really sick. I mean...

696
01:00:32,517 --> 01:00:34,704
我们需要信誉
We just need credit.

697
01:00:35,225 --> 01:00:37,413
呃...我会去工作，之后我会还钱的
Uh... I can work a shift,and then I can pay you back.

698
01:00:39,183 --> 01:00:42,204
是的，我可以连那些一起还了
Yeah, well if I work a shift,then I can pay that too.

699
01:00:44,392 --> 01:00:46,371
我难受成这样根本不能工作
I can't work when I'm this sick!

700
01:00:48,142 --> 01:00:50,225
好的，再见
Ok, bye.

701
01:00:50,538 --> 01:00:52,621
狗日的！
Fucking cunt!!

702
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,163
凯蒂
Candy.

703
01:00:57,517 --> 01:01:01,788
-凯蒂  -哦，天哪
-Candy. -Oh God!

704
01:01:01,788 --> 01:01:03,871
接电话
Answer!Answer, please!

705
01:01:08,038 --> 01:01:10,642
他正要接电话
He was just about to answer!

706
01:01:10,954 --> 01:01:19,183
-给我电话  -我要用电话！
-Give me the phone.-I want the fucking phone!

707
01:01:19,183 --> 01:01:20,225
别拿我的电话，不行，不可以！
Don't fucking take it away from me!No! No!!

708
01:01:21,683 --> 01:01:28,142
-我们可以做到的   -不，滚开！不！！！
-We can do it. -No! Get away!! Nooooo!!

709
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:30,225
凯蒂，你在流血
Candy, you're bleeding.

710
01:01:30,433 --> 01:01:31,996
凯蒂，你在流血
Candy, you're bleeding.

711
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,183
你怎么会流血？
Why are you bleeding?

712
01:01:40,017 --> 01:01:43,454
羊水破了，她的宫颈扩张了
The water has broken.Her cervix has dilated.

713
01:01:44,183 --> 01:01:46,058
这是我们不愿意看到的
This is what we didn't want to happen.

714
01:01:46,788 --> 01:01:49,288
我们都知道这是无法避免的流产
We call this an inevitable miscarriage.

715
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:50,329
我们尽力了
There's no going back.

716
01:01:50,954 --> 01:01:55,433
当我努力向凯蒂解释的时候，她正不得不经受...分娩的痛苦
As I was explaining to Candy,she's going to
have to go through a kind of... labour!

717
01:01:56,058 --> 01:02:00,017
我不知道那持续了多久，你必须怀孕过才知道那个过程
I don't know however long that takes, you need to know that at this state of the pregnancy...

718
01:02:00,017 --> 01:02:01,788
孩子没能够活下来
...the baby is not going to survive.

719
01:02:03,142 --> 01:02:04,704
真对不起
I'm Sorry.

720
01:02:46,579 --> 01:02:48,663
给我哌替啶（一种人工合成的镇痛和催眠药）
Give me pethidine!

721
01:02:48,663 --> 01:02:50,225
我需要哌替啶！
I want pethidine!

722
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,413
你不想给她哌替啶吗？
Will you give her the fucking pethidine, or what?

723
01:02:52,829 --> 01:02:54,913
她实在是太痛苦了，难道你没看见？
She's fucking in pain,can't you see this?

724
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:11,163
就这样！凯蒂，用力！
That's it! Candy, push!

725
01:03:12,621 --> 01:03:14,704
快出来了，用力，对了！！
Almost there! Push! That's it!!

726
01:03:37,933 --> 01:03:40,017
我可以抱抱吗？
Can I hold it?

727
01:03:56,579 --> 01:03:58,767
医生，他的腿动了
Doctor, its leg moved.

728
01:03:59,183 --> 01:04:00,225
只是痉挛而已
It's just a spasm.

729
01:04:00,225 --> 01:04:01,058
他明明动了！
It moved!

730
01:04:01,058 --> 01:04:03,142
就是痉挛！
It's just a spasm.

731
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:10,954
地狱
Hell

732
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:57,933
-你赚了多少钱？ -50
-How much did you get?  -50.

733
01:05:59,913 --> 01:06:01,996
那家伙又来了
That guy is still back there.

734
01:06:02,204 --> 01:06:04,913
-也许你会卖一点，会吗？ -好吧
-Maybe you'll sell some. Yeah? -Alright.

735
01:06:09,704 --> 01:06:11,788
我们所做的一切
<i>Everything we ever did...</ i>

736
01:06:12,308 --> 01:06:14,392
都怀着美好的愿望
<i> we did with the best of intentions... </ i>

737
01:06:14,808 --> 01:06:19,183
但是..年复一年，事与愿违！
<i> But.. events tumble!and the years pile up.</ i>

738
01:06:19,288 --> 01:06:23,767
对一个瘾君子来说，世界是扑朔迷离的
<i> The world is very bewildering to a junkie. </ i>

739
01:06:26,996 --> 01:06:29,079
耶，我们都很棒
Yeah, we're all good!

740
01:06:37,204 --> 01:06:43,975
-纯度不够  -靠！
-Well... Tastes bad. -Fuck!

741
01:06:43,975 --> 01:06:46,058
开始吧
Here you go.

742
01:06:48,454 --> 01:06:50,538
你察觉到什么了吗？
Do you feel anything?

743
01:06:51,267 --> 01:06:52,829
没啊
No.

744
01:06:56,788 --> 01:06:58,871
-妈的！ -我靠！
-Shit!  -Shit!

745
01:07:04,183 --> 01:07:08,767
你仍然坚持思想的转变
<i> and still... you cling to the concept of change. </ i>

746
01:07:18,454 --> 01:07:20,538
嘿，舒曼
Hey, Schumann...

747
01:07:20,538 --> 01:07:22,933
我们正打算搬到乡下住一阵
...we are thinking of moving up the country for a while.

748
01:07:22,933 --> 01:07:24,704
试试美沙酮(一种镇痛药)
Give methadone a try.

749
01:07:27,204 --> 01:07:29,288
这东西有什么不同？
What the fuck difference would it make?

750
01:07:37,621 --> 01:07:40,538
可以当空气清新剂
The air's cleaner, for one.

751
01:08:37,621 --> 01:08:39,704
这是厨房
It's a kitchen.

752
01:08:46,892 --> 01:08:48,975
有点暗，不是吗？
It's a bit dark, isn't it?

753
01:08:48,975 --> 01:08:50,017
是的
Yeah.

754
01:08:51,058 --> 01:08:53,142
是的，我们可以..
Yeah, we Could um...

755
01:08:53,142 --> 01:08:58,350
打一个洞..开个天窗
knock out a hole...and put a skylight.

756
01:09:16,475 --> 01:09:18,038
我爱你
I love you.

757
01:09:52,517 --> 01:09:54,600
有冷冻青豆吗？
Any frozen peas?

758
01:09:55,121 --> 01:09:56,683
没
No.

759
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,746
我找到一个，在那儿
I got one! There he is!

760
01:10:01,475 --> 01:10:03,558
一直是涡轮霜冻
It was all the way down in the turbo frost.

761
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,183
你早上竟然没有准备
I can not believe you didn't do this, this morning.

762
01:10:14,496 --> 01:10:16,579
他们啥时候到？
What time are they coming?

763
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:18,350
日了！！
Fuck!!

764
01:10:34,183 --> 01:10:35,746
生产日期是多少？
What's the date?

765
01:10:35,746 --> 01:10:38,246
哦，不，过期一个月了
Oh no, this expired a month ago.

766
01:10:42,308 --> 01:10:43,871
你自己看，难闻死了！
Look at that! It smells bad!

767
01:10:44,392 --> 01:10:46,475
-整个厨房都臭了！-难道不是吗？
-That's got that kind of chicken smell!
-Yeah it does，doesn't it!

768
01:10:47,725 --> 01:10:52,725
别担心，亲爱的，我们有很多东西可以用来调味
Not to worry, we'll just baste it in lots of stuff!
Like uh...

769
01:10:52,725 --> 01:10:54,808
比如薄荷叶、月桂叶什么的？
Basil, uh... honey?Bayleaves or something?

770
01:10:55,225 --> 01:10:57,308
橱柜里有什么？
What's in the cupboard?

771
01:10:58,038 --> 01:11:00,121
你用什么烤肉呢？
What do you put on a roast?

772
01:11:05,433 --> 01:11:08,246
你们到这儿花了多长时间？
How long did it take you to get out here?

773
01:11:08,767 --> 01:11:10,850
大概1小时40分钟？亲爱的？
Oh, About an hour and 40 minutes? Dear?

774
01:11:15,329 --> 01:11:17,413
是的，大约40，还是45分钟？
Yeah, about... 40? 45?

775
01:11:20,642 --> 01:11:22,204
不堵车吗?
Much traffic?

776
01:11:22,308 --> 01:11:24,392
不会，一路畅通
No, pretty good run really.

777
01:11:24,704 --> 01:11:26,788
无可挑剔
Can't complain.

778
01:11:28,975 --> 01:11:31,683
这儿太美了，开车是种享受
It's so beautiful here,
the drive down was so beautiful.

779
01:11:31,683 --> 01:11:35,017
是啊，这是乡村
Yeah, it's... Countryside.

780
01:11:39,392 --> 01:11:41,475
找工作有着落了吗？
Had any news on the job front?

781
01:11:42,829 --> 01:11:47,725
额..还行吧..这儿的岗位不是很多，我们靠救济金还过得去
Um... Well it's pretty... There's not much work around here.
We're getting by on the dole.

782
01:11:48,246 --> 01:11:51,267
那么，看来我要找份工作贴补家用了
Well, apparently I might be able to
get some work hay bailing.

783
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:53,975
贴补家用？
Hay bailing?

784
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,683
-哦！辛苦工作，勉强糊口？-是的
-Ooooh! Tough work, hay bailing!-Yeah.

785
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:02,829
既然这样，我帮忙做饭吧
So! What can I do in the kitchen?

786
01:12:02,933 --> 01:12:04,913
不需要，真的，我能行！
Nothing mum, really! It's fine!

787
01:12:04,913 --> 01:12:06,579
废话，一定有什么我能帮忙的
Nonsense, there must be something I can do to help.

788
01:12:06,892 --> 01:12:08,454
我自己就能搞定
Everything's under control.

789
01:12:08,767 --> 01:12:10,329
炉子烧开了
The oven's heating up.

790
01:12:13,142 --> 01:12:15,017
我们有些落伍了
We're running a bit behind.

791
01:12:15,642 --> 01:12:16,683
别担心，伙计
<i> No worries, mate. </ i>

792
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:21,475
这真是难以置信，你煞费苦心就是为了请我们到这儿来
Oh This is unbelievable.You go to all this trouble
to invite us up here...

793
01:12:21,475 --> 01:12:24,913
而且你竟然不能按时准备一餐便饭
...and you can't even manage the simple decency of getting the meal together on time!

794
01:12:25,121 --> 01:12:26,579
别管我，妈
Get off my case, mum!

795
01:12:26,579 --> 01:12:27,933
食物还在其次
Is not food that's even the issue here.

796
01:12:27,933 --> 01:12:29,288
问题是你的态度
It's your attitude!

797
01:12:29,704 --> 01:12:31,892
好吧，我们都冷静，午饭不到一小时就好了
Okay, let's just calm down. Lunch will be ready
in less than an hour.

798
01:12:31,892 --> 01:12:32,933
谁想来点儿酒？
Who wants some wine?

799
01:12:34,704 --> 01:12:36,579
那鸡肉像石头！
That chicken is rock solid!

800
01:12:36,579 --> 01:12:39,079
我们午夜前不打算吃东西
We're not going to be eating before midnight.

801
01:12:39,183 --> 01:12:40,433
蔬菜在哪儿呢？
And where are the vegetables?

802
01:12:40,433 --> 01:12:41,475
嘿，嘿，大家都静一静，亲爱的
Hey hey, Let's all calm down, honey.

803
01:12:42,204 --> 01:12:44,288
你在想什么？
What do you think is about?

804
01:12:44,913 --> 01:12:47,933
周日午餐，本来很简单的一件事
Sunday Lunch.It's a pretty simple thing.

805
01:12:48,663 --> 01:12:50,850
但是你俩一掺和，就没简单的事
But with you two, there's no such thing as simple.

806
01:12:51,163 --> 01:12:52,204
毒品！
The drugs!

807
01:12:52,829 --> 01:12:55,329
你们就知道吸毒！
The drugs always come first.

808
01:12:55,642 --> 01:12:57,413
不，不是那样的
Hey no, that is not true.

809
01:12:57,517 --> 01:12:59,704
我们现在已经做的很好了
We're doing really well now.

810
01:13:01,475 --> 01:13:03,558
你知道什么
Do you have any idea...

811
01:13:05,433 --> 01:13:08,871
你对我的家庭都做过什么？
...what you have done to my family?

812
01:13:10,225 --> 01:13:12,308
对我呢？
To me?

813
01:13:13,767 --> 01:13:16,892
那个美丽的女孩怎么啦？
What happened to that beautiful girl?

814
01:13:17,413 --> 01:13:19,496
怎么了？
What happened?

815
01:13:19,704 --> 01:13:21,788
怎么了？
What happened?

816
01:13:22,413 --> 01:13:24,496
难道你看不见？
Can't you see?

817
01:13:25,538 --> 01:13:27,621
难道你不明白？
Don't you understand?

818
01:13:28,142 --> 01:13:33,350
我六岁起就攥紧了拳头
I have been clutching my fucking fists
since I was 6 years old.

819
01:13:34,392 --> 01:13:36,475
看看我的拳头，仔细看看
Look at my fucking fists!

看看他们，你这烂货

821
01:13:41,475 --> 01:13:43,558
难道你不明白
Don't you understand?

822
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,621
我明白！我会握紧我的手！
No! I gotta clench my hands!

823
01:13:50,017 --> 01:13:51,371
我会握紧我的手不放松

827

你们失去了一个孩子
C'mon, you've lost a child.

828

但是你们的生命连在一起，我可以看到

829
01:14:08,454 --> 01:14:09,808
去吧

830
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:12,100

忘记午餐的事吧

832

可以取消午餐吗？
Can we cancel the lunch?

834
01:14:23,767 --> 01:14:25,850
我们可以另外挑个好日子

835
01:14:26,996 --> 01:14:30,121
今天不行，我很抱歉

我好怕

837
01:14:46,163 --> 01:14:48,246
没什么可怕的

没什么可怕的

839

你觉得我们结束了吗？

840

-我们永远不会结束  -会的

841
01:15:16,579 --> 01:15:18,663
这不管用
It's not gonna work.

842
01:15:34,704 --> 01:15:36,788
是流感疫苗吗？
Is that the flu vaccine?

843
01:15:36,788 --> 01:15:38,871
是药
It's medicine.

844
01:15:40,329 --> 01:15:42,413
它指引我们免于诱惑

845
01:15:47,413 --> 01:15:49,496

866
01:19:07,621 --> 01:19:09,704
你和那家伙上床了吗？

867
01:19:12,308 --> 01:19:14,392
你在胡说八道
You do not know what you're talking about.

868

关你妈什么事？
And what's this with your mother anyway?

883
01:20:28,038 --> 01:20:30,121
如果不是她

884
01:20:30,121 --> 01:20:30,954
那么你
...Then you.

888
01:20:49,704 --> 01:20:51,163
说得好，凯蒂

你是个混蛋诗人！

891
01:22:32,308 --> 01:22:34,392
曾经，有一对男女名叫丹和凯蒂

那年一切都很火热

一天晚上，欲火点燃了绣床

整个大地都倾斜了

<i>And that was it...

958
01:34:57,725 --> 01:34:59,808
一切都随风消散
<i>That was all that was scattered to the winds...

959
01:35:00,850 --> 01:35:02,933
卡斯珀消失了
<i>Casper was gone...

960
01:35:03,142 --> 01:35:05,225
舒曼消失了
<i> Schumann was lost...

961
01:35:05,642 --> 01:35:08,142
凯蒂没有好转
<i> Candy was off getting better...

962
01:35:08,558 --> 01:35:10,642
海岸...
<i> The coast...

963
01:35:10,642 --> 01:35:12,517
改过迁善
<i> Rehab...

964
01:35:12,517 --> 01:35:13,975
而我...
<i> And I...Was...

965
01:35:13,975 --> 01:35:16,683
我只是...

966
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:18,246
清洗者，丹
The washer, Dan.

967
01:35:18,246 --> 01:35:19,913
世界冠军级的清洗者
World Championship washer.

968
01:35:20,746 --> 01:35:22,725
有一天，你会为澳大利亚清洗
One day, you'll wash for Australia.

969
01:35:24,808 --> 01:35:27,725
这个世界充满了奇思妙想
<i> The world was full of startling new concepts.

970
01:35:30,329 --> 01:35:34,392
我无法思考，无法呼吸
<i> I couldn't think.I couldn't breathe.

971
01:35:35,433 --> 01:35:37,517
我在等她回来
<i>I was waiting for her to come back.

972
01:35:38,558 --> 01:35:40,642
因为她是我的一切

973
01:35:42,621 --> 01:35:44,704
她是我的一切
<i> She was everything to me.

974
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:50,433
嘿，丹，有人找你
Hey Dan, you have a visitor.

975
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:52,933
有人找
Visit.

976
01:36:05,017 --> 01:36:07,100
跟她说我不在
Just Tell her I'm not here.

977
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,454
你疯了吗？
Are you crazy?

978
01:36:08,558 --> 01:36:10,642
告诉她我不在！
Tell her I knocked off.

979
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:17,204
你的朋友来了，快出来吧
Your friend is right here, just come.

980
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:30,433
-你好 -嘿！
-G'day. -Hey!

981
01:36:38,558 --> 01:36:40,642
我还以为你明天才来
I thought it was tomorrow.

982
01:36:42,517 --> 01:36:44,600
我等不急了
I couldn't wait.

983
01:36:46,058 --> 01:36:47,517
还好吗
Is that okay?

984
01:36:48,038 --> 01:36:50,121
挺好的
Yeah! No, it's good!

985
01:36:54,288 --> 01:36:56,371
你真漂亮
It's just!You look so beautiful.

986
01:36:57,933 --> 01:37:00,017
乡下的空气养人
It's all that country air.

987
01:37:01,788 --> 01:37:03,871
我一小时后收工
So I finish in an hour.

988
01:38:16,058 --> 01:38:18,142
丹
Dan.

989
01:38:22,725 --> 01:38:28,975
丹，嘿，嘿！
Dan. Hey!Hey!

990
01:38:31,163 --> 01:38:35,433
丹尼，丹尼！嘿！
Danny, Danny! Hey!

991
01:38:35,433 --> 01:38:39,392
没关系的，嘿！
It's Okay.Hey!

992
01:38:39,392 --> 01:38:41,996
嘿，没关系的，我来了
Hey, It's Okay,I'm here now.

993
01:38:56,683 --> 01:38:59,288
我们没有可能了
There's no going back.

994
01:39:07,308 --> 01:39:10,225
如果你得以解脱
If you're given a reprieve...

995
01:39:10,225 --> 01:39:14,913
你为何不去想想
I think it is good to remember...

996
01:39:14,913 --> 01:39:21,683
想想那孩子有多瘦小
...just how thin it is.

997
01:41:39,704 --> 01:42:29,183
剧终
