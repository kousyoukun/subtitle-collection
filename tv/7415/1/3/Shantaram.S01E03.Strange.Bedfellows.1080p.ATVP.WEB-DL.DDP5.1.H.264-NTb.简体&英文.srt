她需要见医生 否则很快就会死去
She needs a doctor, or she's gonna die quickly.

00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,320
我们的人没有在街上互相杀戮和开枪
Our men are not killing and shooting each other in the streets,

141
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,910
每个人都心满意足
and everyone is satisfied.

142
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,320
公司之间很和平是因为 经营者都是些疲惫的老人
The companies are at peace because they're run by tired, old men

143
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,660
安于现状
who've settled for the status quo.

144
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,120
除了你的
Except yours?

145
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,370
除了我的
Except mine.

146
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,580
鲁祖生前认为你软弱 对吗
Rujul, he believed you are weak, huh?

147
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,500
知道何为正确不意味着一个人软弱
Certainty of what is right does not make anyone weak,

148
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,590
否则经营克拉巴护照市场的 会是你 而不是我
or you'd still be running the passport market in Colaba, not me.

149
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,050
瓦利德 是因为这个吗
Is that what this is, Walid?

150
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,430
因为自尊心受伤 你想掀起战争
You want to start a war over your hurt pride?

151
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,230
我不打算掀起任何东西 伙计 这只关乎生意
I'm not starting anything. This is business, yaar.

152
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,270
萨嘎尔瓦达价值连城 所以我不过是向鲁祖出了更高的价
Sagar Wada is worth a fortune. So, I simply made Rujul a better offer.

153
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,190
我是不会失去萨嘎尔瓦达的
I am not going to lose Sagar Wada.

154
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,940
这算是威胁吗
Is that a threat?

155
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,030
只是简单陈述事实
A simple statement of fact.

156
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,120
对你来说是事实而已吧 大叔
For you maybe, chachu, huh?

157
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,250
一个男人也许认为自己的老婆漂亮
You see, one man can say his wife is beautiful,

158
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,080
但另一个男人却觉得她丑陋
and another only sees a pig.

159
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,840
要我简单陈述事实的话 我的人手和金钱比你多
You see, I think it is a simple fact that I have more men and money than you.

160
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,470
我也认为女人和毒品生意才有未来
I think it is a simple fact that women and drugs are the future,

161
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,930
然而你选择留在过去
and yet you choose to stay in the past.

162
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,510
卡德尔拜 你必须给人们他们想要的东西
You have to give the people what they want, Khaderbhai.

163
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,720
否则你会成为历史
Otherwise, you are consigned to history.

164
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,150
也许我会在我的地盘 萨嘎尔瓦达的门前为你建一座大雕像
Maybe I'll build a big statue of you at the gates of my Sagar Wada, huh?

165
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,370
和你交谈总是很愉快 瓦利德拜
Always a pleasure talking with you, Walidbhai.

166
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,360
你醒了 太好了 跟我来 有个东西你必须看看 老大
You're awake? Good. Come. Something you gotta see, boss.

167
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,230
好的 稍等片刻
All right. Just give me a minute.

168
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,490
快点啊 哥们
Come, na.

169
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,790
嗨
Hey.

170
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,960
他们在做什么
What are they all doing?

171
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,010
他们是你的病人
They're your patients.

172
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,590
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

173
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,840
他们都知道你昨晚治疗居民的事
They all know about the doctoring you did last night,

174
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,300
所以现在排队来看你
so now they wait to see you.

175
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,390
不...我可不是...
No. No. I'm not--

176
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,680
林 不会有问题的 林先生 -我不行
Lin, no-- no problem waiting, Linbaba. -I can't.

177
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,690
他们已经等了一个多小时了 我说你得睡觉
They're here more than one hour already. I told them you must sleep.

178
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,770
帕拉布
Prabhu.

179
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,320
就算你没来 他们也会继续等的
Even if you were not here, they would still be waiting

180
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,200
只是白等一场
but waiting for nothing only.

181
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,490
那会让他们失去希望
And that kills the heart.

182
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,780
但是等待有所回报 那就不同了 对吧
But waiting for something, that is different, na?

183
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,490
我不能这么做 听着 我都不算医生
I can't do that. Look, I'm not even a doctor.

184
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,250
糟糕的医生总比没医生好
Even bad doctor better than no doctor.

185
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,040
我不是说你糟糕 意思是即使你糟糕也没事
I'm not saying you are bad, only that if you were, it would be okay.

186
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,460
林 拜托了
Lin, please.

187
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,680
帕拉布 -拉克什米原本就无法生还的
Prabhu. -Lakshmi was going to die anyway.

188
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,010
我们会为她悼念
And we will grieve her.

189
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,220
但有时生活就是这样
But that is how it is sometimes.

190
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,980
帕拉布 你好吗  -好
How are you, Prabhu? -Okay.

191
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,440
林先生
Mr. Lin.

192
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,030
听着 关于昨晚 我想道歉 你是对的 我应该听你的话
Look, I wanna say sorry about last night. You were right. I should have listened.

193
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,950
卡西姆 他会帮我们吗
Qasim, is he going to help us?

194
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,550
我从没这么想逃跑过
I wanted to run more than ever,

195
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,590
用卡拉的钱赋予我的第二次机会 就此离开孟买
take the second chance Karla's money had given me and get out of Bombay,

196
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,260
虽然我接受的帮助令这些人蒙受痛苦
despite what helping me had done to these people.

197
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,510
会很好的 相信我
It will be good, you'll see.

198
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,760
上帝保佑
God willing.

199
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,410
林先生 这笔钱不少啊
This is a lot of money to be giving away, Linbaba.

200
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,040
是的 我需要的东西也不少
Yeah, well, I'm gonna need a lot of things.

201
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,790
可你为什么要这么做
But why you do this?

202
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,660
我有我的原因
I've got my reasons.

203
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,040
来吧 收下 用这笔钱重建烧毁的屋子
Go on, take it. Use it to rebuild the homes that burned.

204
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,090
拜托你了
Please.

205
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,850
我会确保每分每毫都用在对的地方
I will make sure every paisa is well spent.

206
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,280
好了 再等两分钟 好吗
All right! Just two more minutes. Okay?

207
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,360
好的
Okay.

208
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,300
涂抹一点这个 好吧
Put some of this on, all right?

209
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,720
只可能是我
It had to be me.

210
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,970
接受过相同培训的人 不会因为犯罪而被迫躲在贫民区里
Another man with my training wouldn't have been forced by crime into the slum.

211
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,560
而罪犯不会像我一样接受过医疗培训
Another criminal wouldn't have had my training.

212
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,480
我不懂当中的幽默 我也不觉得这命运好笑在哪
I didn't get the joke, and fate didn't make me laugh.

213
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,690
但我知道我不能离开
But I knew I couldn't leave.

214
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,540
还有20个病人
We have 20 more patients.

215
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,290
好吗 出来 好的
Okay? Out. Okay.

216
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,590
快点...
Let's go. Let's go.

217
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,670
嗨
Hi.

218
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,610
你得吃点东西
You need to eat.

219
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,290
早餐可真是丰盛啊
Breakfast of champions.

220
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,960
你有时候真幼稚
You can be such a child sometimes.

221
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,500
你是因为我帮你戒毒而生我气吗
Are you angry with me for helping you get clean?

222
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,670
生气的人是你
You're the one who's angry.

223
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,640
总是要照顾我这点让你这么生气吗
Does it piss you off so much that you have to look after me?

224
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,760
我希望你能照顾好自己 莉莎
I want you to look after yourself, Lisa.

225
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,180
但你不会的 因为你就喜欢自己孱弱无力
But you won't, because you like being powerless,

226
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,650
因为无论你身处哪一个宇宙 这让你成为那里的中心
because it makes you the center of whatever universe you happen to be in.

227
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,860
有人照顾他人是出于爱
Some people look after you because they love you.

228
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,320
这又不是坏事
That's not a bad thing.

229
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,860
如果那人离开了呢
And what happens when they aren't there?

230
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,700
你不能一辈子拒绝关心某人
You can't spend your life refusing to care for anyone

231
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,780
只因他们可能离开
in case they leave.

232
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,490
莉莎 我不能和你吵 现在不行
I can't do this, Lisa. Not now.

233
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,330
现在的情况下 我不想和你争执
I don't wanna fight with you, not with everything else.

234
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,090
对不起
I'm sorry.

235
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,590
你说得对 我的表现太自私 像个被宠坏的贱人
You're right. I'm being a selfish, spoiled bitch.

236
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,640
怎么了
What is it?

237
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:56,020
昨天我满脑子都在想不能软弱
Yesterday, all I could think about was not being weak.

238
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,870
现在我一闭眼 只看到死去的鲁祖
And now, I close my eyes, and all I see is Rujul dead.

239
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,160
卡达尔知道
Khader knew.

240
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,950
他想保护我 但他做得越多
He tried to protect me, and the more he did,

241
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,420
我就越是坚定地想要证明自己能应对
the more I was determined to prove myself I could handle it.

242
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,000
卡拉 你不需要证明任何事的
You don't have to prove anything, Karla.

243
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,550
如果我不那么做 交易会失败
If I don't, the deal will fall apart.

244
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,010
那有多糟呢
And would that be so bad?

245
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,970
你上次任自己放松 感到快乐 是什么时候
When is the last time you let yourself go and felt happy?

246
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,100
真正的快乐
Truly happy?

247
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,150
我们一起当废物吧
Let's be fucked-up together.

248
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,650
我保证会吃一些 不对你犯浑
I promise to eat some of this and not be a royal pain in the ass,

249
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,610
只要你保证留在这陪我 和我一起听唱片 像旧日一样
if you promise to stay here with me and play records with me like old times

250
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,410
直到我们喝光了酒 嗑完了大麻
until we run out of booze and hash.

251
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,830
好的
Okay.

252
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,840
你需要休息 我可以让他们明天再来
You are needing rest? I can tell them to come back tomorrow.

253
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,300
不 我没事
No, I'm good.

254
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,480
停下 林医生要休息一下
Stop! Dr. Lin will be taking a break now.

255
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,650
这是给你的谢礼 林医生
This is a thank-you, Dr. Lin.

256
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,940
其实这是帕拉布的主意
Well, it was actually Prabhu's idea.

257
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,490
是我的主意
It was my idea.

258
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,070
他说服卡西姆阿里这么做 让我用他的棚屋
He talked Qasim Ali into it and let me use his hut.

259
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,120
是我说服卡西姆阿里的
I talked Qasim Ali into it.

260
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,540
是帕拉布买来了所有这些物资
It was Prabhu who got all the supplies.

261
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,750
物资是我买的
I got the supplies.

262
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,090
帕拉布 你这么做真好
Prabhu, this was a good thing that you did.

263
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,470
你需要帮忙照料病人吗
You need help with patients?

264
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,430
不用了 我们可以的 谢谢
No. We're good, thank you.

265
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,060
不过这个很好吃啊
This is great, though.

266
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,240
林先生 不错吧 非常顺利...
Very good, huh, Linbaba? Very slick, very smooth,

267
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,280
直到你让她走 帕瓦蒂
until you sent her away. Parvati!

268
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,700
多谢你
Thank you, huh?

269
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,880
如果你想的话 吃完后 我可以把盘子送还你
If you like, I will bring back your tray when we are finished.

270
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,960
去奶茶店
At the chai shop.

271
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,460
你会在那里吗
You'll be there?

272
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,800
我会在那里
I'll be there.

273
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,480
好啦 你们看什么呢 你们没正事干吗
All right, what are you staring at? Haven't you got work to do?

274
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,650
走吧
Let's go.

275
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,410
你看得有滋有味啊
You are enjoying, huh?

276
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,490
很美味...
Yummy, yummy.

277
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,060
宫殿的营运模式是预约制
The Palace operates on an appointment-only basis.

278
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,190
宫殿营运是因为我们允许它营运
The Palace operates because we let it.

279
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,520
告诉周说我们到了 去吧
Tell Zhou we're here. Go.

280
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:28,070
帕德玛 我不是某个无助的女孩 会屈从你们的规矩
I'm not some helpless girl, Padma, that will bend to your discipline.

281
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,200
你必须把携带的武器留在这里
You will need to leave any weapons you carry here.

282
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,580
我不会
No, I won't.

283
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,680
卡德尔拜 太荣幸了 请问需要什么喝的或吃的吗
This is an honor, Khaderbhai. Can I get you something to drink or eat?

284
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,680
最近我与鲁祖阿德卡 进行了非常严肃的会面
Recently, I spent a solemn moment with Rujul Aadekar.

285
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,270
今晨我和瓦利德沙会面
This morning, I spent some time with Walid Shah.

286
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,820
现在 我来看你
And now, I've come to see you.

287
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,990
我不赞许你做的生意
I do not approve of your business,

288
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,530
但我理解这种生意必定会存在
but I understand it is a business that must exist.

289
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,030
所以你被允许来这里 蓬勃发展
So, you've been allowed to come here and prosper.

290
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,750
但是你的成功基于一个条件 就是中立
But there has been one condition to your success. Neutrality.

291
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,710
我犯了一个错 卡德尔拜
I made a mistake, Khaderbhai.

292
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,880
我只能道歉
I can only apologize.

293
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,880
一开始我以为你知悉
At first, I assumed you knew of it.

294
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,970
但我意识到并非如此时 已经太晚了
When I realized this wasn't the case, it was too late.

295
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,690
正如你说 我在孟买本地的处境脆弱...
As you say, my position here in Bombay is vulnerable--

296
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,400
女士 你不太擅长扮演受害者
You do not play the victim well, Madame.

297
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:49,900
希望你从前当情妇和妓女时 假装的功力更强一点
I hope you were better at faking back when you were a mistress and a whore.

298
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,740
正如我说的 我犯了一个错
Like I said, I made a mistake.

299
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,990
但如果我要为此死去
But if I was going to die for it,

300
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:03,210
我认为你不会亲自来这里动手
I don't think you would come here yourself to watch it happen.

301
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:09,420
死去的你对我毫无用处 活着的你也许有些用处
Dead, you are of no use to me. Alive, maybe I could use you.

302
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:14,260
你应明白 当我离开这地方时 我会带上你的命
Understand that when I leave this place, I will take your life with me

303
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,260
作为你现在所欠债务的抵押品
as collateral against the debt that you now owe.

304
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,180
当我向你提出要求 你必须满足
And when I ask something of you, you will do it,

305
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,890
否则这地方会成为你的葬身殿
or this place will burn as your funeral pyre.

306
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,940
你是怎么知道的
How did you know?

307
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,740
是卡拉萨兰恩说的
Was it Karla Saaranen?

308
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,820
谁
Who?

309
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,910
我没听过这名字
I do not know that name.

310
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,120
鲁祖是我的人
Rujul belonged to me.

311
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,330
我对他的了解胜过他对自己的了解
I knew him better than he knew himself.

312
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:47,210
所以我派人跟踪他 他去过哪里 做了什么 见了谁
So I had him followed, where he went, what he did, who he saw.

313
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,590
他没想到这一点是他愚蠢
He was stupid to think otherwise.

314
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,050
而他的愚蠢让他送命
It was his stupidity that got him killed.

315
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,470
希望你并不愚蠢 女士
I hope you're not stupid, Madame.

316
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:39,050
林先生 我们要为拉克什米的葬礼造柴堆
Linbaba, we are now going to build the pyre for Lakshmi's funeral

317
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,720
欢迎你一起来
if you want to come.

318
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,640
对不起 强尼 我没资格去
I'm sorry, Johnny. I got no right to be there.

319
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,140
帕拉布说你责怪自己
Prabhu told me you blame yourself.

320
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,650
帕拉布话太多了
Prabhu talks too much.

321
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,820
是
Yeah.

322
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:39,950
卡德尔拜今天饶了你一命 这么做明智吗
Khaderbhai gave you your life today. Is this wise?

323
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,990
我的命不由任何人赐予或拿走
My life isn't any man's to give or take.

324
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,250
我和他们一样了解他们的生意
I know their business as well as them.

325
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,080
这些“大哥”...去他们的
All these bhais... Fuck them.

326
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,500
也许是时候让位给“大姐”了 帕德玛
Maybe it's time for the behains, Padma.

327
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,720
我们之间有协定
We had a deal, you and I.

328
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,180
如果你说的是莉莎 我遵从了协定
If you're talking about Lisa, I kept my part of it.

329
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,350
莉莎离开了
Lisa is gone.

330
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,020
我不认为那是我的错
I don't see how that is my fault.

331
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,890
毛里齐奥 那你在怕什么
Then why are you scared, Maurizio?

332
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,650
我不怕
I am not.

333
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,150
我认为你怕
I think you are.

334
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:21,660
我认为只有这种时候 男人和女人才能真正一样
I think maybe it's the only time when men and women can truly be the same,

335
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,370
当他们无权无势 害怕至极时
when they're powerless and terrified.

336
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,200
可是女人被迫拥有这种感受的时刻 比男人多得多
But women are forced to feel it so much more than men.

337
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,750
往往是被男人逼迫
By men, usually.

338
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,330
为什么叫我来这里
Why am I here?

339
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,800
你想得到我的原谅 有一个办法
There is a way for you to earn my forgiveness.

340
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
请说
I'm listening.

341
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:46,010
我想要你在克拉巴帮我卖海洛因
I want you to sell brown sugar for me in Colaba.

342
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,980
克拉巴是卡德尔拜的地盘
Colaba is Khaderbhai's territory.

343
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,560
但他不在那里卖海洛因
But he doesn't sell heroin there.

344
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,730
其他人也没有
Neither does anyone else.

345
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,480
我对他并没有忠诚 你呢
I owe him no loyalty. Do you?

346
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,650
我
Me?

347
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,320
我对任何人都没有忠诚
I owe loyalty to no one.

348
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,910
至少这是大实话
Which is honest, at least.

349
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,910
我的条件很简单
My terms are simple.

350
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,410
不得提我的名字 你抽二成利润
My name is never mentioned. You keep 20% of the profit.

351
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,750
四成 风险全由我承担
Forty. I'm taking all of the risk.

352
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,210
我不是在和你磋商
I'm not negotiating with you.

353
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,640
大概有多少
How much are we talking about?

354
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,100
你能卖多少 我就有多少阿富汗海洛因
I have access to as much Afghan dope as you can sell.

355
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,980
好的 说定了
Okay then. You have a deal.

356
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,020
那你就不需要害怕任何事了
Then you have nothing to fear.

357
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,740
林先生
Mr. Lin?

358
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,450
我叫阿卜杜拉塔哈利
My name's Abdullah Taheri.

359
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,040
有个人想见你
I have someone who wants to meet you.

360
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,290
好的 谁
Okay. Who is it?

361
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,670
请
Please.

362
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,440
林赛福特先生
Mr. Lindsay Ford?

363
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,690
叫我林就好
Just "Lin" works.

364
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,360
见到你很高兴 久仰大名
I'm pleased to meet you. I've heard good things.

365
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,160
在孟买这里听到关于外国人的好话 总是令人开心
It's always nice to hear good things about foreigners here in Bombay.

366
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,000
也许你也听过我 我是阿布戴尔卡达尔可汗
You might have heard of me also. My name is Abdel Khader Khan.

367
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,880
你现在是棚屋区医生了
So, you are the doctor in the hutments now.

368
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,170
这个 我...距离医生还远着呢
Well, I'm-- I'm a long way from being a doctor.

369
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,630
也许正是因此你才这么出色
Well, maybe that is why you are doing so well.

370
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,300
医生不会主动来贫民区
Doctors do not go into the jhopadpatti willingly.

371
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,060
我们可以说服人不做坏事
We can compel men not to be bad,

372
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,020
但我们无法说服他们做好事 你不觉得吗
but we cannot compel them to do good, don't you find?

373
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,100
我从没思考过这点
I never really thought about it.

374
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,770
不知道什么东西能说服你
I wonder what compels you.

375
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,490
有什么能帮你的吗
Is there something I can do for you?

376
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,990
我还不知道
I don't know yet.

377
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,200
所以我才来这里
That is why I am here,

378
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,490
邀请你和我的朋友阿卜杜拉聊聊
to invite you to spend some time with me and my friend Abdullah.

379
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,830
好吧 我无意冒犯 但是我就直说了
All right. I mean no offense, but I'm just gonna say this.

380
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,960
你的名声挺吓人的
You have a fairly scary reputation.

381
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:27,930
所以你突然这样出现 应该不难理解我有点紧张
So you just turning up like this, you can see why I might be a bit nervous

382
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:31,090
不太想坐上你车的后座 让你载我走
about jumping in the back of your car and letting you drive me away.

383
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,680
我向你保证 今晚你不会受到任何伤害
I give you my word. No harm will come to you this night.

384
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,350
我有选择吗
Do I have a choice?

385
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,100
你永远都有选择
You always have a choice.

386
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:44,860
最终 我认为选择是我们唯一拥有的东西
In the end, I think that is all we have.

387
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,200
好吧
Okay.

388
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,240
宵禁就像不存在一样
So much for curfew.

389
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,660
当局知道
The authorities know

390
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:40,040
大城市的文明人需要聚会和谋生的地方
that civilized people in large cities need places to gather and hunt.

391
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:45,000
所以某些地方可以行贿 秩序得以被保留
So certain establishments are permitted to pay a bribe, and order is preserved.

392
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,960
明面上法律依然有效 但不会执行
Officially, the law remains. It's just not enforced.

393
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,630
谁决定哪些法律要执行 哪些法律不执行呢
Who gets to decide which laws get enforced and which ones don't?

394
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,140
有人曾说腐败作为管治系统的一部分 最糟糕的一点在于
Someone once said the worst thing about corruption as a system of governance

395
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,850
它的效果太好了
is that it works so well.

396
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
拉米什
Ramesh!

397
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,490
你父亲可好
How is your father?

398
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:16,200
他很好 卡德尔拜 谢谢
He is well, Khaderbhai. Thank you.

399
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,620
但我遇到了麻烦
But I am having a problem.

400
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,750
告诉我
Tell me.

401
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,250
先生 是关于我的房东
Bhai, it's about my landlord.

402
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:24,460
他已经要求租金涨一倍
He is demanding double rent already.

403
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:29,840
他想驱逐我们 不只是我 还有楼里的所有家庭
He wants to evict us, not just me, but all the families in my building.

404
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,430
他有打手 他的打手把我们打得很惨
He has goondas, and his goondas beat us badly.

405
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,140
甚至包括我的父亲
Even my own father.

406
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,560
那么你父亲并不好
Then he is not well.

407
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,940
是的 先生 他的自尊心太强 不愿向你求助
No, sir. He is too proud to ask you for help

408
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,270
不想打扰你
and doesn't want to disturb your peace.

409
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,060
可是我...
But I...

410
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,440
你是个好儿子
You're a good son.

411
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,900
我们不会做任何伤害他自尊心的事
We won't do anything to hurt his pride.

412
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,570
也毋须和你父亲提及这次谈话
And there will be no need to speak to your father about this

413
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,740
直到这个麻烦解决 愿上帝保佑
until the problem is solved, inshallah.

414
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,700
谢谢你... -好的 是...
Thank you, thank-- -Okay, okay. Yes, yes, yes.

415
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,120
你听懂了多少
How much did you understand?

416
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,590
没多少 关于他家和他父亲什么的
Not much. Something about his home and his father.

417
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,800
他们的房东想赶走他们
Their landlord wants them out of their place.

418
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,260
必要时会动粗
By force, if necessary.

419
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,300
所以你去威胁那个威胁他们的人
So you threaten the man who threatens them?

420
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,140
你赞同吗
Do you approve?

421
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,310
我觉得你并不需要我的赞同
I don't think you need my approval.

422
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,230
你是阿布戴尔卡达尔可汗
You're Abdel Khader Khan.

423
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,820
只因为我可以轻易做某事 不意味着我应该这么做
Just because I can easily do something doesn't always mean I should.

424
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,440
如果换做是你 你觉得应该这样做吗
Humor me. If it were you?

425
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,870
我觉得如果我喜欢拉米什 而这个房东的做法很过分
I think if I liked Ramesh and this landlord was out of line,

426
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,580
那我会尽我所能帮助他
then I'd do what I could for him.

427
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,250
就算那可能违法
Even if it meant acting against the law?

428
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,040
谁决定哪些法律要执行 哪些法律不执行呢
Who gets to choose which laws get enforced and which ones don't?

429
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:56,840
最终 无论是哪条法律 无论是谁来选择
In the end, regardless of laws or who chooses,

430
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,180
我们每一个人 每个宇宙 每个星系中的每个原子
each one of us, every atom in every galaxy in every universe,

431
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,060
都会向上帝靠近
is moving towards God.

432
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,190
我不信上帝
I don't believe in God.

433
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:13,280
那么我们能聊的就更多了 你和我
Then we have much more to talk about, you and I.

434
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,740
走 我们带他去俱乐部
Let's go. We will take him to the club.

435
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,210
你说了会陪我 -不 我只是没说不会陪
You said you'd stay with me. -No. I just didn't say I wouldn't.

436
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,050
你的协定
Your deal.

437
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,800
莉莎 我已经走到这一步 我没有选择
I've come too far, Lisa. I don't have a choice.

438
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,600
可不能让卡达尔可汗先生失望
Can't disappoint Mr. Khader Khan.

439
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,270
留下 求你了
Stay. Please.

440
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,610
为了我们俩
For both of us.

441
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,780
我能看出这给你带来的影响 你也知道
I can see what this is doing to you. You know it too.

442
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,280
你只是不愿承认
You just won't admit it.

443
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,410
选择我 陪着我
Choose me. Stay with me.

444
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,200
因为这才是最重要的
Because this matters the most.

445
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,040
我很在乎你 你清楚的
I care about you. You know that.

446
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,130
但你还是要选他
But you're choosing him anyway.

447
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,440
这家俱乐部有孟买最棒的加扎勒歌手
This club has the best ghazel singers in Bombay.

448
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,400
什么是加扎勒
What are ghazels?

449
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,480
爱之曲 给上帝的爱之曲
Love songs. Love songs to God.

450
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,280
无论你怎么想 信上帝这件事并不存在
No matter what you might think, there is no believing in God.

451
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,410
我们认识上帝 或不认识 只有这两种
We either know him or we do not.

452
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:32,000
我不认识上帝 但我觉得 他的存在不太可能
Well, I don't know God, but I think he's pretty much impossible.

453
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,580
上帝的存在不太可能正是他存在的证据
The fact that God is impossible is proof he exists.

454
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,090
所以是不是所有可能的事物都不存在呢
So does that mean that all possible things don't exist?

455
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,050
很高兴你理解我的意思
I'm delighted you understand.

456
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,880
我真的不理解
I really don't.

457
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,590
我的朋友 你有麻烦了
You're in trouble now, my friend.

458
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:48,640
没有任何事物是我们所看到的样子 我们的眼睛是骗子
Nothing exists as we see it. Our eyes are liars.

459
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,140
一切看上去真实的东西都属于某种幻象
Everything that seems real is part of the illusion.

460
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,640
你 我 这个房间
You, me, this room.

461
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:59,860
那么如果一切都是幻象 那我们怎么知道做什么 如何生活
So if everything's an illusion, how do we know what to do, how to live?

462
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,740
我们说谎
We lie.

463
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,780
头脑清醒的人不过是比 头脑不清醒的人更擅长说谎罢了
The sane man is simply a better liar than the insane man.

464
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,160
你的眼睛会说谎
Your eyes lie.

465
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,830
你以为自己知道的事情 让你认为并非如此 那其实这是真的
What you think you know tells you this is not so, but it's true.

466
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:16,380
我们更喜欢谎言 因为那样更简单
We prefer the lie because it's easier.

467
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,130
那要如何保持清醒
That's how we stay sane?

468
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:25,930
我没有结婚 我没有儿子
I am not married, and I have no sons.

469
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,100
但如果我告诉你 我清楚地看到你是我的儿子
But if I tell you that I see it clearly that you are my son,

470
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,810
阿卜杜拉是你的哥哥 我是你的父亲
Abdullah is your brother, I am your father,

471
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,310
你会认为这不可能
you will think that is impossible.

472
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:38,730
你会抗拒 你确实如此 我看得出
You will resist it. You do. I see it.

473
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:43,860
你宁肯相信我们都是陌生人这个谎言
You prefer to believe the lie that we are all strangers,

474
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,450
相信我们之间没有关连
and there is no connection between us.

475
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,780
我有父亲
I have a father.

476
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,700
我不了解你 你不了解我
And I don't know you. You don't know me.

477
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,580
也许我了解
I think maybe I do.

478
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,260
林先生 你会对自己说哪些谎言
What do you lie to yourself about, Mr. Lin?

479
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,260
我不会 我已经不再那样做了
I don't. I'm finished with that.

480
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:14,140
我知道自己是谁 做了什么 欠了什么
I know what I am, what I've done, what I owe.

481
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,900
我决定喜欢林这个人

482
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,530
你觉得这音乐如何
How did you like the music?

483
00:42:56,530 --> 00:43:00,200
棒极了 从没听过这样的音乐
It's incredible. I never heard anything like it before.

484
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,660
能问你一件事吗
Can I ask you something?

485
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,710
今晚的所有这些...你为什么带我来这里
All this, tonight... Why'd you bring me here?

486
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,040
你想在我这里得到什么
What do you want from me?

487
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,010
你在这里做什么
What are you doing here?

488
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,340
听音乐 喝茶
Listening, drinking tea,

489
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:22,640
学习我所知道的世界是一种幻象这件事
learning that the world as I know it is an illusion.

490
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,060
我嗑嗨了
I'm pretty stoned.

491
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,980
你本应离开孟买的
You were meant to leave Bombay.

492
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:30,020
林先生 你的这位朋友是
Who is your friend, Mr. Lin?

493
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,150
这是卡拉萨兰恩
This is Karla Saaranen.

494
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:34,820
我们是朋友吗
Are we friends?

495
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,950
不知道
I don't know.

496
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:42,530
这么说吧 到目前我在孟买的日子里 卡拉是重要而关键的一部分
Let's just say Karla has had a full and central part of my life in Bombay so far.

497
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,700
无论是真是假
Real or not.

498
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,040
我觉得她是真的
I think she's real.

499
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,620
事实上
In fact,

500
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,340
卡拉证明了我是对的
Karla proves that I'm right.

501
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,590
如果我想象出了她 她对我的态度应该好得多
If I invented her, she would be a lot nicer to me.

502
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:58,180
卡拉 这位是阿卜杜拉塔哈利
Karla, allow me to introduce Abdullah Taheri,

503
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,180
他似乎是我没有血缘关系的兄弟
my brother from another mother, apparently,

504
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,680
我的新相识阿布戴尔卡达尔可汗先生 让我们两兄弟再聚首
recently reunited by my newest acquaintance, Mr. Abdel Khader Khan.

505
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:06,810
你大概听过他的大名 -当然
You've probably heard of him. -Of course.

506
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:09,100
萨拉恩女士 幸会
It's a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Saaranen.

507
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:12,150
彼此彼此 你们是怎么认识的
Likewise. How do you all come to know each other?

508
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,900
命运使然
Fate saw fit to throw us together.

509
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,530
还真有趣
Funny how that happens.

510
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,450
是的 “处于苦难中的人不择伙伴”
Yeah, well, "Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows."

511
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,870
怪物是谁
Who's the monster?

512
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,830
什么意思
What do you mean?

513
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:27,410
这句话是一个和怪物同床的人说的
That line is spoken by a man who lies down with a monster.

514
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,410
萨兰恩女士对莎士比亚很了解
Ms. Saaranen knows her Shakespeare.

515
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,500
有人曾告诉我
Someone once told me

516
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,170
人生中的所有问题和大部分答案
that all the questions and most of the answers in life

517
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,710
都可以在莎士比亚里找到
can be found in Shakespeare.

518
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,670
要加入我们吗
Would you like to join us?

519
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,760
不行 我还有客人要招待
I can't. I've got guests of my own.

520
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,930
我们要谈生意 我应该回去了
We have business to conclude. I should get back to them.

521
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,310
祝你的生意顺利
Good luck with your business.

522
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:48,270
愿上帝保佑
Inshallah.

523
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,850
祝你们今晚愉快 先生们
Enjoy the rest of your evening, gentlemen.

524
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:05,890
林 今晚很愉快
It has been a pleasure, Lin.

525
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,520
这是某种考验吗
Was this some kind of test?

526
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,520
你为什么在萨嘎尔瓦达帮忙
Why do you help in Sagar Wada?

527
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,900
他们需要
They needed it.

528
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,820
那算是某种高尚举动
An act of nobility then?

529
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,650
不 高尚这个词用不到我身上 这我可以打包票
Nah, there's nothing noble about me. You can trust me on that.

530
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,660
人没有好坏之分
There are no good men or bad men.

531
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:30,290
是他们做的事或不愿做的事 定义了他们的好坏
It is what they do, or refuse to do, that makes them good or evil.

532
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,160
这个地方对我的意义重大
This place means a great deal to me.

533
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,050
可汗先生 多谢你今晚的招待
Thank you for tonight, Mr. Khan.

534
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:44,340
请叫我卡德尔拜
Please, call me Khaderbhai.

535
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,720
卡德尔拜
Khaderbhai.

536
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:49,930
发音还算标准
Close enough.

537
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,650
也许是命运 让我和这两个人相遇 父亲和兄弟
Maybe fate brought me together with these men, father and brother.

538
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,530
但那之后发生的一切都是我自己的选择
But everything that came after was down to my own choices,

539
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,160
正如卡达尔说的
just like Khader had said.

540
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,660
你杀了她 你杀了我的母亲
You took her away. You took my mother away.

541
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,040
她是我的全部
She was all I had.

542
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:39,790
是
Yeah.

543
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,710
虽然是无心之失 但的确如此
I didn't mean to, but I did.

544
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,050
拉维 我受够了永远做错事
I'm tired, Ravi, of getting it so fucking wrong all the time.

545
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,220
你要用这个吗
Are you gonna use that?

546
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,600
拉维
Ravi!

547
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,020
拉维 你在做什么
What are you doing, Ravi?

548
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:09,740
拉维 孩子
Ravi, my son...

549
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,950
你母亲已经离世
Your mother is gone.

550
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:18,040
这么做 你也会毁了自己的一辈子
Do this, and you'll lose yourself forever also.

551
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,040
你明白吗
Understand?

552
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,960
这孩子不应该
This child does not deserve

553
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,170
因为杀了你而背负良心的重担 林先生
to carry your murder on his conscience, Mr. Lin.

554
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,920
你不懂这一点说明你是个自私的傻瓜
And you are a selfish fool for not knowing better.

555
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:39,310
去我的棚屋 你和我家人一起生活吧
Go to my hut. You will stay with my family now.

556
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,060
不 卡西姆叔叔 拜托 我不伤他 但...
No. Uncle Qasim, please. I won't hurt him, but...

557
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:45,230
拉维 听我的话
Ravi. Do as I say.

558
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:46,570
去吧
Go.

559
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,860
你对他说了什么
What did you say to him?

560
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:53,450
他现在和我家人一起生活
That he will stay with my family now.

561
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,160
拉克什米的棚屋属于你了 林先生
Lakshmi's hut will now be yours, Mr. Lin.

562
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:05,130
这里的人需要你的帮助时 就会来这里找你
When people here need your help, this is where they will find you.

563
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,800
这不是我给你的礼物
This is not a gift I'm giving you.

564
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,760
是
Yeah.

565
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:42,370
