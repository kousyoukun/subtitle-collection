1
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,220
Come on! Let's use all the water we have!

2
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,730
Hurry up! Hurry up! Use sheets to put out the fire.

3
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,460
Tear down these huts. We need to make a firebreak.

4
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,340
I hate these fires. You want to kill me? Come on!

5
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,290
What's burning?

6
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,540
It's Sagar Wada. It's where Lin was staying.

7
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,420
You said yourself he's gone.

8
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,880
I'm cold.

9
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,200
All right. You have to keep this clean. You understand?

10
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,450
Understand. Okay.

11
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,530
All right. Good man.

12
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,790
Salaam alaikum, Mr. Lin.

13
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,330
Wa alaikumu assalam.

14
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,590
I'm Qasim Ali, headman here.

15
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,130
Prabhu has told me all about you.

16
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,970
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

17
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,550
Thank you for what you are doing.

18
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,760
Well, I could do more with better supplies.

19
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,390
If you get me whatever you have--

20
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,060
Some of these people need hospital, drugs, IVs.

21
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,600
Yes, but none of these things will be coming here.

22
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,850
You already have what we have, huh?

23
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,480
Parvati?

24
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,780
Can someone take a look at Lakshmi?

25
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,530
What happened? What happened, Lakshmi?

26
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,900
Lin, come here!

27
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,870
Okay, bring her here.

28
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,870
I need another table, to lie her down.

29
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,960
Slowly. Easy, easy.

30
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,130
Okay. You're all right. No, you're okay.

31
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,460
You're all right. Easy. You're all right.

32
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,890
Ask her if she's having trouble breathing.

33
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
She needs a hospital to take out that metal.

34
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,400
What, you can't do this? -No. No way.

35
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,990
I think it's punctured her lung.

36
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,820
Mom. -Ravi!

37
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,950
No. No, no, no! It came out.

38
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,780
Ravi! -Mom!

39
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,120
Prabhu! Put your hands on there, all right?

40
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,620
Solid pressure.

41
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,040
Move your hands. Move your hands!

42
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,630
I need you to hold her. All right? -Okay.

43
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,050
Don't let her move. -Okay.

44
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,720
Tell her this is gonna help her breathe.

45
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,220
Don't touch her!

46
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,280
Get away from my mother!

47
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,940
Qasim, I need to be able to hear.

48
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,280
Ravi, stop! He's trying to help her.

49
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,910
Ravi. -That good?

50
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,750
Ravi. Ravi. -Mom!

51
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,250
Ravi.

52
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,050
Shit. Fuck.

53
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,170
What happened? -She needs a doctor now.

54
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,220
Move! Move!

55
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,640
Prabhu, help me lift her.

56
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,050
On three. One, two, three.

57
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,520
Mom. -Mr. Lin, where are you taking her?

58
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,600
She needs a doctor, or she's gonna die quickly.

59
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,820
Then let her die surrounded by the people she loves.

60
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,780
I want her to live with the people she loves,

61
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,240
not die with them. Prabhu?

62
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,450
This is wrong. -On three. One, two, three.

63
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,950
Ravi. Ravi. -Lakshmi, it's okay.

64
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,160
We're taking you to the doctor. -Go, go, go!

65
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,660
Ravi. Ravi! Ravi.

66
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,830
Don't worry, Ravi. They're helping your mother.

67
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,210
Lin.

68
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,920
Lin, listen!

69
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,170
She's not dying, Prabhu. Not because of me.

70
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,470
Hey! We need help!

71
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,720
Hey! Stop! Hey!

72
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,470
Prabhu, Prabhu. -We got a dying woman here!

73
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,890
Prabhu. Prabhu.

74
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,940
Hey. Hey, stop!

75
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,480
Lin, stop! Enough!

76
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,830
What did she say?

77
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,040
It does not matter.

78
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,000
I want to know.

79
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,170
She asked for Ravi.

80
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,100
They'll be back soon.

81
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,440
How many huts have burned?

82
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,650
Thirty. Mine included.

83
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,950
Mom!

84
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,510
I will go get some food and chai, okay?

85
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,090
I'm not hungry.

86
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,760
Lin.

87
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,720
You were trying to do the best thing. I know this. So you can--

88
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,100
This was my fault.

89
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,900
Prabhu, if I hadn't been here, this fire would've never happened--

90
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,730
Lin, please. Please.

91
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,030
Fires, they happen here.

92
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,120
You think I'm not hating Lakshmi is gone, huh?

93
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,830
This time, we are lucky.

94
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,080
Last year, there was much bigger fire, much more of the jhopadpatti was burned.

95
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,710
More than 20 died.

96
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,170
I will bring food, okay?

97
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,450
Drop the-- Fuck. Fuck.

98
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,710
Drop the clipboard and put your hands up.

99
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,290
Get the fuck on.

100
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,670
Don't touch any fucking alarm buttons, all right?

101
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,710
Could you ladies fill these bags up, please?

102
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,220
It's all insured. It's really not worth worrying about.

103
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,890
Just do what he says.

104
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,060
Please... Laura. -Okay, okay, okay.

105
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,850
Why don't you get a job, you lazy bastards?

106
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,390
Hey! Excuse me, this is our job, you fat ass.

107
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,730
Don't get in the way of us doing it, all right?

108
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,190
Come on, love. It's all good. You just need to fill the bag.

109
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,860
Can't you see she's terrified?

110
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,490
Just fill the bag!

111
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,040
Out of the way! Out of the way! Move! Move!

112
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,250
Watch it.

113
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,170
Sorry, mate. My fault.

114
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,970
Hey. Get off me.

115
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,180
Drop the bloody gun.

116
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,180
Get off me! Bastard. Drop the gun!

117
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,310
Get the fuck off me.

118
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,600
Drop the gun! Drop it! Drop it! -Okay. Okay. Okay!

119
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,610
What did you do?

120
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,290
Move.

121
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,040
Dale.

122
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,460
Dale, fucking move.

123
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Now. Come on.

124
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,880
Dale.

125
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,560
Somebody, call an ambulance.

126
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,640
Okay. Hey, hey. Stay with me. Hey.

127
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,900
You're all right, mate. You're all right.

128
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,150
Stay with me.

129
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,650
Get away from him!

130
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,360
Salaam alaikum, Walidbhai.

131
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,690
Alaikumu assalam, Khaderbhai.

132
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,030
Interesting choice of location.

133
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,790
Sad to think how many men once earned a living here in better days.

134
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,370
Arre, everything has its use-by date, huh?

135
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,170
And everyone.

136
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,880
Now, you wanted to talk. This is where we can do it.

137
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,720
Rujul Aadekar is dead.

138
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,730
Had I been in your shoes, I would have done exactly the same.

139
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,820
All the companies are at peace.

140
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,320
Our men are not killing and shooting each other in the streets,

141
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,910
and everyone is satisfied.

142
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,320
The companies are at peace because they're run by tired, old men

143
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,660
who've settled for the status quo.

144
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,120
Except yours?

145
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,370
Except mine.

146
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,580
Rujul, he believed you are weak, huh?

147
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,500
Certainty of what is right does not make anyone weak,

148
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,590
or you'd still be running the passport market in Colaba, not me.

149
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,050
Is that what this is, Walid?

150
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,430
You want to start a war over your hurt pride?

151
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,230
I'm not starting anything. This is business, yaar.

152
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,270
Sagar Wada is worth a fortune. So, I simply made Rujul a better offer.

153
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,190
I am not going to lose Sagar Wada.

154
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,940
Is that a threat?

155
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,030
A simple statement of fact.

156
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,120
For you maybe, chachu, huh?

157
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,250
You see, one man can say his wife is beautiful,

158
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,080
and another only sees a pig.

159
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,840
You see, I think it is a simple fact that I have more men and money than you.

160
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,470
I think it is a simple fact that women and drugs are the future,

161
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,930
and yet you choose to stay in the past.

162
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,510
You have to give the people what they want, Khaderbhai.

163
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,720
Otherwise, you are consigned to history.

164
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,150
Maybe I'll build a big statue of you at the gates of my Sagar Wada, huh?

165
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,370
Always a pleasure talking with you, Walidbhai.

166
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,360
You're awake? Good. Come. Something you gotta see, boss.

167
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,230
All right. Just give me a minute.

168
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,490
Come, na.

169
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,790
Hey.

170
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,960
What are they all doing?

171
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,010
They're your patients.

172
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,590
What are you talking about?

173
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,840
They all know about the doctoring you did last night,

174
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,300
so now they wait to see you.

175
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,390
No. No. I'm not--

176
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,680
Lin, no-- no problem waiting, Linbaba. -I can't.

177
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,690
They're here more than one hour already. I told them you must sleep.

178
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,770
Prabhu.

179
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,320
Even if you were not here, they would still be waiting

180
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,200
but waiting for nothing only.

181
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,490
And that kills the heart.

182
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,780
But waiting for something, that is different, na?

183
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,490
I can't do that. Look, I'm not even a doctor.

184
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,250
Even bad doctor better than no doctor.

185
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,040
I'm not saying you are bad, only that if you were, it would be okay.

186
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,460
Lin, please.

187
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,680
Prabhu. -Lakshmi was going to die anyway.

188
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,010
And we will grieve her.

189
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,220
But that is how it is sometimes.

190
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,980
How are you, Prabhu? -Okay.

191
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,440
Mr. Lin.

192
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,030
Look, I wanna say sorry about last night. You were right. I should have listened.

193
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,950
Qasim, is he going to help us?

194
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,550
I wanted to run more than ever,

195
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,590
take the second chance Karla's money had given me and get out of Bombay,

196
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,260
despite what helping me had done to these people.

197
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,510
It will be good, you'll see.

198
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,760
God willing.

199
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,410
This is a lot of money to be giving away, Linbaba.

200
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,040
Yeah, well, I'm gonna need a lot of things.

201
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,790
But why you do this?

202
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,660
I've got my reasons.

203
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,040
Go on, take it. Use it to rebuild the homes that burned.

204
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,090
Please.

205
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,850
I will make sure every paisa is well spent.

206
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,280
All right! Just two more minutes. Okay?

207
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,360
Okay.

208
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,300
Put some of this on, all right?

209
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,720
It had to be me.

210
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,970
Another man with my training wouldn't have been forced by crime into the slum.

211
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,560
Another criminal wouldn't have had my training.

212
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,480
I didn't get the joke, and fate didn't make me laugh.

213
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,690
But I knew I couldn't leave.

214
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,540
We have 20 more patients.

215
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,290
Okay? Out. Okay.

216
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,590
Let's go. Let's go.

217
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,670
Hi.

218
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,610
You need to eat.

219
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,290
Breakfast of champions.

220
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,960
You can be such a child sometimes.

221
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,500
Are you angry with me for helping you get clean?

222
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,670
You're the one who's angry.

223
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,640
Does it piss you off so much that you have to look after me?

224
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,760
I want you to look after yourself, Lisa.

225
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,180
But you won't, because you like being powerless,

226
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,650
because it makes you the center of whatever universe you happen to be in.

227
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,860
Some people look after you because they love you.

228
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,320
That's not a bad thing.

229
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,860
And what happens when they aren't there?

230
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,700
You can't spend your life refusing to care for anyone

231
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,780
in case they leave.

232
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,490
I can't do this, Lisa. Not now.

233
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,330
I don't wanna fight with you, not with everything else.

234
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,090
I'm sorry.

235
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,590
You're right. I'm being a selfish, spoiled bitch.

236
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,640
What is it?

237
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:56,020
Yesterday, all I could think about was not being weak.

238
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,870
And now, I close my eyes, and all I see is Rujul dead.

239
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,160
Khader knew.

240
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,950
He tried to protect me, and the more he did,

241
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,420
the more I was determined to prove myself I could handle it.

242
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,000
You don't have to prove anything, Karla.

243
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,550
If I don't, the deal will fall apart.

244
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,010
And would that be so bad?

245
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,970
When is the last time you let yourself go and felt happy?

246
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,100
Truly happy?

247
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,150
Let's be fucked-up together.

248
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,650
I promise to eat some of this and not be a royal pain in the ass,

249
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,610
if you promise to stay here with me and play records with me like old times

250
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,410
until we run out of booze and hash.

251
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,830
Okay.

252
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,840
You are needing rest? I can tell them to come back tomorrow.

253
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,300
No, I'm good.

254
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,480
Stop! Dr. Lin will be taking a break now.

255
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,650
This is a thank-you, Dr. Lin.

256
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,940
Well, it was actually Prabhu's idea.

257
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,490
It was my idea.

258
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,070
He talked Qasim Ali into it and let me use his hut.

259
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,120
I talked Qasim Ali into it.

260
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,540
It was Prabhu who got all the supplies.

261
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,750
I got the supplies.

262
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,090
Prabhu, this was a good thing that you did.

263
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,470
You need help with patients?

264
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,430
No. We're good, thank you.

265
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,060
This is great, though.

266
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,240
Very good, huh, Linbaba? Very slick, very smooth,

267
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,280
until you sent her away. Parvati!

268
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,700
Thank you, huh?

269
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,880
If you like, I will bring back your tray when we are finished.

270
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,960
At the chai shop.

271
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,460
You'll be there?

272
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,800
I'll be there.

273
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,480
All right, what are you staring at? Haven't you got work to do?

274
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,650
Let's go.

275
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,410
You are enjoying, huh?

276
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,490
Yummy, yummy.

277
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,060
The Palace operates on an appointment-only basis.

278
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,190
The Palace operates because we let it.

279
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,520
Tell Zhou we're here. Go.

280
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:28,070
I'm not some helpless girl, Padma, that will bend to your discipline.

281
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,200
You will need to leave any weapons you carry here.

282
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,580
No, I won't.

283
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,680
This is an honor, Khaderbhai. Can I get you something to drink or eat?

284
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,680
Recently, I spent a solemn moment with Rujul Aadekar.

285
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,270
This morning, I spent some time with Walid Shah.

286
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,820
And now, I've come to see you.

287
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,990
I do not approve of your business,

288
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,530
but I understand it is a business that must exist.

289
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,030
So, you've been allowed to come here and prosper.

290
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,750
But there has been one condition to your success. Neutrality.

291
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,710
I made a mistake, Khaderbhai.

292
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,880
I can only apologize.

293
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,880
At first, I assumed you knew of it.

294
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,970
When I realized this wasn't the case, it was too late.

295
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,690
As you say, my position here in Bombay is vulnerable--

296
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,400
You do not play the victim well, Madame.

297
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:49,900
I hope you were better at faking back when you were a mistress and a whore.

298
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,740
Like I said, I made a mistake.

299
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,990
But if I was going to die for it,

300
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:03,210
I don't think you would come here yourself to watch it happen.

301
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:09,420
Dead, you are of no use to me. Alive, maybe I could use you.

302
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:14,260
Understand that when I leave this place, I will take your life with me

303
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,260
as collateral against the debt that you now owe.

304
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,180
And when I ask something of you, you will do it,

305
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,890
or this place will burn as your funeral pyre.

306
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,940
How did you know?

307
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,740
Was it Karla Saaranen?

308
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,820
Who?

309
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,910
I do not know that name.

310
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,120
Rujul belonged to me.

311
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,330
I knew him better than he knew himself.

312
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:47,210
So I had him followed, where he went, what he did, who he saw.

313
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,590
He was stupid to think otherwise.

314
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,050
It was his stupidity that got him killed.

315
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,470
I hope you're not stupid, Madame.

316
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:39,050
Linbaba, we are now going to build the pyre for Lakshmi's funeral

317
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,720
if you want to come.

318
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,640
I'm sorry, Johnny. I got no right to be there.

319
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,140
Prabhu told me you blame yourself.

320
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,650
Prabhu talks too much.

321
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,820
Yeah.

322
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:39,950
Khaderbhai gave you your life today. Is this wise?

323
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,990
My life isn't any man's to give or take.

324
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,250
I know their business as well as them.

325
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,080
All these bhais... Fuck them.

326
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,500
Maybe it's time for the behains, Padma.

327
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,720
We had a deal, you and I.

328
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,180
If you're talking about Lisa, I kept my part of it.

329
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,350
Lisa is gone.

330
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,020
I don't see how that is my fault.

331
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,890
Then why are you scared, Maurizio?

332
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,650
I am not.

333
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,150
I think you are.

334
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:21,660
I think maybe it's the only time when men and women can truly be the same,

335
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,370
when they're powerless and terrified.

336
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,200
But women are forced to feel it so much more than men.

337
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,750
By men, usually.

338
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,330
Why am I here?

339
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,800
There is a way for you to earn my forgiveness.

340
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
I'm listening.

341
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:46,010
I want you to sell brown sugar for me in Colaba.

342
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,980
Colaba is Khaderbhai's territory.

343
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,560
But he doesn't sell heroin there.

344
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,730
Neither does anyone else.

345
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,480
I owe him no loyalty. Do you?

346
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,650
Me?

347
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,320
I owe loyalty to no one.

348
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,910
Which is honest, at least.

349
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,910
My terms are simple.

350
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,410
My name is never mentioned. You keep 20% of the profit.

351
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,750
Forty. I'm taking all of the risk.

352
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,210
I'm not negotiating with you.

353
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,640
How much are we talking about?

354
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,100
I have access to as much Afghan dope as you can sell.

355
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,980
Okay then. You have a deal.

356
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,020
Then you have nothing to fear.

357
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,740
Mr. Lin?

358
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,450
My name's Abdullah Taheri.

359
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,040
I have someone who wants to meet you.

360
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,290
Okay. Who is it?

361
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,670
Please.

362
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,440
Mr. Lindsay Ford?

363
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,690
Just "Lin" works.

364
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,360
I'm pleased to meet you. I've heard good things.

365
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,160
It's always nice to hear good things about foreigners here in Bombay.

366
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,000
You might have heard of me also. My name is Abdel Khader Khan.

367
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,880
So, you are the doctor in the hutments now.

368
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,170
Well, I'm-- I'm a long way from being a doctor.

369
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,630
Well, maybe that is why you are doing so well.

370
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,300
Doctors do not go into the jhopadpatti willingly.

371
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,060
We can compel men not to be bad,

372
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,020
but we cannot compel them to do good, don't you find?

373
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,100
I never really thought about it.

374
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,770
I wonder what compels you.

375
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,490
Is there something I can do for you?

376
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,990
I don't know yet.

377
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,200
That is why I am here,

378
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,490
to invite you to spend some time with me and my friend Abdullah.

379
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,830
All right. I mean no offense, but I'm just gonna say this.

380
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,960
You have a fairly scary reputation.

381
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:27,930
So you just turning up like this, you can see why I might be a bit nervous

382
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:31,090
about jumping in the back of your car and letting you drive me away.

383
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,680
I give you my word. No harm will come to you this night.

384
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,350
Do I have a choice?

385
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,100
You always have a choice.

386
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:44,860
In the end, I think that is all we have.

387
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,200
Okay.

388
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,240
So much for curfew.

389
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,660
The authorities know

390
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:40,040
that civilized people in large cities need places to gather and hunt.

391
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:45,000
So certain establishments are permitted to pay a bribe, and order is preserved.

392
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,960
Officially, the law remains. It's just not enforced.

393
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,630
Who gets to decide which laws get enforced and which ones don't?

394
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,140
Someone once said the worst thing about corruption as a system of governance

395
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,850
is that it works so well.

396
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Ramesh!

397
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,490
How is your father?

398
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:16,200
He is well, Khaderbhai. Thank you.

399
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,620
But I am having a problem.

400
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,750
Tell me.

401
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,250
Bhai, it's about my landlord.

402
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:24,460
He is demanding double rent already.

403
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:29,840
He wants to evict us, not just me, but all the families in my building.

404
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,430
He has goondas, and his goondas beat us badly.

405
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,140
Even my own father.

406
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,560
Then he is not well.

407
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,940
No, sir. He is too proud to ask you for help

408
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,270
and doesn't want to disturb your peace.

409
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,060
But I...

410
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,440
You're a good son.

411
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,900
We won't do anything to hurt his pride.

412
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,570
And there will be no need to speak to your father about this

413
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,740
until the problem is solved, inshallah.

414
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,700
Thank you, thank-- -Okay, okay. Yes, yes, yes.

415
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,120
How much did you understand?

416
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,590
Not much. Something about his home and his father.

417
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,800
Their landlord wants them out of their place.

418
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,260
By force, if necessary.

419
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,300
So you threaten the man who threatens them?

420
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,140
Do you approve?

421
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,310
I don't think you need my approval.

422
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,230
You're Abdel Khader Khan.

423
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,820
Just because I can easily do something doesn't always mean I should.

424
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,440
Humor me. If it were you?

425
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,870
I think if I liked Ramesh and this landlord was out of line,

426
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,580
then I'd do what I could for him.

427
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,250
Even if it meant acting against the law?

428
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,040
Who gets to choose which laws get enforced and which ones don't?

429
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:56,840
In the end, regardless of laws or who chooses,

430
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,180
each one of us, every atom in every galaxy in every universe,

431
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,060
is moving towards God.

432
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,190
I don't believe in God.

433
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:13,280
Then we have much more to talk about, you and I.

434
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,740
Let's go. We will take him to the club.

435
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,210
You said you'd stay with me. -No. I just didn't say I wouldn't.

436
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,050
Your deal.

437
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,800
I've come too far, Lisa. I don't have a choice.

438
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,600
Can't disappoint Mr. Khader Khan.

439
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,270
Stay. Please.

440
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,610
For both of us.

441
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,780
I can see what this is doing to you. You know it too.

442
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,280
You just won't admit it.

443
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,410
Choose me. Stay with me.

444
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,200
Because this matters the most.

445
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,040
I care about you. You know that.

446
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,130
But you're choosing him anyway.

447
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,440
This club has the best ghazel singers in Bombay.

448
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,400
What are ghazels?

449
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,480
Love songs. Love songs to God.

450
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,280
No matter what you might think, there is no believing in God.

451
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,410
We either know him or we do not.

452
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:32,000
Well, I don't know God, but I think he's pretty much impossible.

453
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,580
The fact that God is impossible is proof he exists.

454
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,090
So does that mean that all possible things don't exist?

455
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,050
I'm delighted you understand.

456
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,880
I really don't.

457
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,590
You're in trouble now, my friend.

458
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:48,640
Nothing exists as we see it. Our eyes are liars.

459
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,140
Everything that seems real is part of the illusion.

460
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,640
You, me, this room.

461
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:59,860
So if everything's an illusion, how do we know what to do, how to live?

462
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,740
We lie.

463
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,780
The sane man is simply a better liar than the insane man.

464
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,160
Your eyes lie.

465
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,830
What you think you know tells you this is not so, but it's true.

466
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:16,380
We prefer the lie because it's easier.

467
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,130
That's how we stay sane?

468
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:25,930
I am not married, and I have no sons.

469
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,100
But if I tell you that I see it clearly that you are my son,

470
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,810
Abdullah is your brother, I am your father,

471
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,310
you will think that is impossible.

472
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:38,730
You will resist it. You do. I see it.

473
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:43,860
You prefer to believe the lie that we are all strangers,

474
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,450
and there is no connection between us.

475
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,780
I have a father.

476
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,700
And I don't know you. You don't know me.

477
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,580
I think maybe I do.

478
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,260
What do you lie to yourself about, Mr. Lin?

479
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,260
I don't. I'm finished with that.

480
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:14,140
I know what I am, what I've done, what I owe.

481
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,530
How did you like the music?

482
00:42:56,530 --> 00:43:00,200
It's incredible. I never heard anything like it before.

483
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,660
Can I ask you something?

484
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,710
All this, tonight... Why'd you bring me here?

485
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,040
What do you want from me?

486
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,010
What are you doing here?

487
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,340
Listening, drinking tea,

488
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:22,640
learning that the world as I know it is an illusion.

489
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,060
I'm pretty stoned.

490
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,980
You were meant to leave Bombay.

491
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:30,020
Who is your friend, Mr. Lin?

492
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,150
This is Karla Saaranen.

493
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:34,820
Are we friends?

494
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,950
I don't know.

495
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:42,530
Let's just say Karla has had a full and central part of my life in Bombay so far.

496
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,700
Real or not.

497
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,040
I think she's real.

498
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,620
In fact,

499
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,340
Karla proves that I'm right.

500
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,590
If I invented her, she would be a lot nicer to me.

501
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:58,180
Karla, allow me to introduce Abdullah Taheri,

502
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,180
my brother from another mother, apparently,

503
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,680
recently reunited by my newest acquaintance, Mr. Abdel Khader Khan.

504
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:06,810
You've probably heard of him. -Of course.

505
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:09,100
It's a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Saaranen.

506
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:12,150
Likewise. How do you all come to know each other?

507
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,900
Fate saw fit to throw us together.

508
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,530
Funny how that happens.

509
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,450
Yeah, well, "Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows."

510
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,870
Who's the monster?

511
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,830
What do you mean?

512
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:27,410
That line is spoken by a man who lies down with a monster.

513
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,410
Ms. Saaranen knows her Shakespeare.

514
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,500
Someone once told me

515
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,170
that all the questions and most of the answers in life

516
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,710
can be found in Shakespeare.

517
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,670
Would you like to join us?

518
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,760
I can't. I've got guests of my own.

519
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,930
We have business to conclude. I should get back to them.

520
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,310
Good luck with your business.

521
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:48,270
Inshallah.

522
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,850
Enjoy the rest of your evening, gentlemen.

523
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:05,890
It has been a pleasure, Lin.

524
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,520
Was this some kind of test?

525
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,520
Why do you help in Sagar Wada?

526
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,900
They needed it.

527
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,820
An act of nobility then?

528
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,650
Nah, there's nothing noble about me. You can trust me on that.

529
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,660
There are no good men or bad men.

530
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:30,290
It is what they do, or refuse to do, that makes them good or evil.

531
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,160
This place means a great deal to me.

532
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,050
Thank you for tonight, Mr. Khan.

533
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:44,340
Please, call me Khaderbhai.

534
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,720
Khaderbhai.

535
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:49,930
Close enough.

536
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,650
Maybe fate brought me together with these men, father and brother.

537
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,530
But everything that came after was down to my own choices,

538
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,160
just like Khader had said.

539
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,660
You took her away. You took my mother away.

540
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,040
She was all I had.

541
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:39,790
Yeah.

542
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,710
I didn't mean to, but I did.

543
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,050
I'm tired, Ravi, of getting it so fucking wrong all the time.

544
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,220
Are you gonna use that?

545
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,600
Ravi!

546
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,020
What are you doing, Ravi?

547
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:09,740
Ravi, my son...

548
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,950
Your mother is gone.

549
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:18,040
Do this, and you'll lose yourself forever also.

550
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,040
Understand?

551
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,960
This child does not deserve

552
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,170
to carry your murder on his conscience, Mr. Lin.

553
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,920
And you are a selfish fool for not knowing better.

554
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:39,310
Go to my hut. You will stay with my family now.

555
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,060
No. Uncle Qasim, please. I won't hurt him, but...

556
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:45,230
Ravi. Do as I say.

557
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:46,570
Go.

558
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,860
What did you say to him?

559
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:53,450
That he will stay with my family now.

560
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,160
Lakshmi's hut will now be yours, Mr. Lin.

561
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:05,130
When people here need your help, this is where they will find you.

562
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,800
This is not a gift I'm giving you.

563
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,760
Yeah.
