如果有更好的物資 我就能做更多事

19
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,390
如果你能把所能找到的給我...

21
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,600
是 但這里是弄不到那些東西的
Yes, but none of these things will be coming here.

22
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,850
我們有的都已經給你了
You already have what we have, huh?

23
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,480
帕瓦蒂
Parvati?

24
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,780
有人能看看拉克什米嗎
Can someone take a look at Lakshmi?

25
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,530
拉克什米 發生什么了
What happened? What happened, Lakshmi?

26
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,900
林 快過來

再給我一張桌子 把她放平

29

你沒事的...慢慢來

32
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,890
問問她呼吸是否有困難
Ask her if she's having trouble breathing.

33
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
她需要去醫院才能移除這金屬

35
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,990
我認為那金屬刺穿了她的肺部
I think it's punctured her lung.

36
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,820
媽媽 -拉維

緊緊地按壓
Solid pressure.

41
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,040
手拿開...
Move your hands. Move your hands!

告訴她這能幫助她呼吸

卡西姆 太吵了 我聽不見

拉維 別這樣 他是想救她

49
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,910
拉維 -可以嗎

00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,250
拉維
Ravi.

52
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,050
該死的 見鬼

怎么了  -她必須立即看醫生
What happened? -She needs a doctor now.

54

讓開...

55
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,640
帕拉布 幫我將她抬起來
Prabhu, help me lift her.

56
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,050
數到三 一 二 三
On three. One, two, three.

57
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,520
媽媽 -林先生 你要帶她去哪
Mom. -Mr. Lin, where are you taking her?

58
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,600
她需要見醫生 否則很快就會死去
She needs a doctor, or she's gonna die quickly.

59
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,820
那就讓她死在所愛之人的環繞下吧
Then let her die surrounded by the people she loves.

60
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,780
我希望她能在所愛之人的陪伴下生活
I want her to live with the people she loves,

61
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,240
不是在陪伴下死去 帕拉布

62
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,450
這是不對的 -數到三 一 二 三

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,040
那不重要了
It does not matter.

她想見拉維

他們很快就會回來
They'll be back soon.

81
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,440
有多少個棚屋被燒毀了
How many huts have burned?

82
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,650
30個 包括我的
Thirty. Mine included.

83
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,950

我去拿點食物和奶茶 好嗎

這是我的錯
This was my fault.

89
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,900
帕拉布 要不是我在這里 根本就不會有這場火
Prabhu, if I hadn't been here, this fire would've never happened--

90
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,730

91
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,030
這里發生火災并不奇怪
Fires, they happen here.

92
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,120
你認為拉克什米的死不讓我難過嗎
You think I'm not hating Lakshmi is gone, huh?

93
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,830
這一次我們已經算幸運
This time, we are lucky.

求你了 勞拉 -好的...
Please... Laura. -Okay, okay, okay.

Don't get in the way of us doing it, all right?

108
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,190
來吧 親愛的 別擔心 你只需要把袋子裝滿
Come on, love. It's all good. You just need to fill the bag.

109
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,860
看不出來她很害怕嗎
Can't you see she's terrified?

110

這個地方選得有意思
Interesting choice of location.

133
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,790
一想到過去的好日子里 多少人曾在這謀生 就感到難過啊
Sad to think how many men once earned a living here in better days.

134
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,370
伙計 一切事物都有使用期限 對吧
Arre, everything has its use-by date, huh?

Now, you wanted to talk. This is where we can do it.

137

Had I been in your shoes, I would have done exactly the same.

139
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,820
所有公司都處于和平狀態
All the companies are at peace.

140
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,320
我們的人沒有在街上互相殺戮和開槍
Our men are not killing and shooting each other in the streets,

141
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,910
每個人都心滿意足
and everyone is satisfied.

142
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,320
公司之間很和平是因為 經營者都是些疲憊的老人
The companies are at peace because they're run by tired, old men

143
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,660
安于現狀
who've settled for the status quo.

144
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,120
除了你的
Except yours?

145
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,370
除了我的
Except mine.

146
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,580
魯祖生前認為你軟弱 對嗎
Rujul, he believed you are weak, huh?

147
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,500
知道何為正確不意味著一個人軟弱
Certainty of what is right does not make anyone weak,

148
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,590
否則經營克拉巴護照市場的 會是你 而不是我
or you'd still be running the passport market in Colaba, not me.

149
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,050
瓦利德 是因為這個嗎
Is that what this is, Walid?

150
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,430
因為自尊心受傷 你想掀起戰爭
You want to start a war over your hurt pride?

151
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,230
我不打算掀起任何東西 伙計 這只關乎生意
I'm not starting anything. This is business, yaar.

152
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,270
薩嘎爾瓦達價值連城 所以我不過是向魯祖出了更高的價
Sagar Wada is worth a fortune. So, I simply made Rujul a better offer.

153
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,190
我是不會失去薩嘎爾瓦達的
I am not going to lose Sagar Wada.

154
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,940
這算是威脅嗎
Is that a threat?

155
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,030
只是簡單陳述事實
A simple statement of fact.

156
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,120
對你來說是事實而已吧 大叔
For you maybe, chachu, huh?

157
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,250
一個男人也許認為自己的老婆漂亮
You see, one man can say his wife is beautiful,

158
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,080
但另一個男人卻覺得她丑陋
and another only sees a pig.

159
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,840
要我簡單陳述事實的話 我的人手和金錢比你多
You see, I think it is a simple fact that I have more men and money than you.

160
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,470
我也認為女人和毒品生意才有未來
I think it is a simple fact that women and drugs are the future,

161
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,930
然而你選擇留在過去
and yet you choose to stay in the past.

162
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,510
卡德爾拜 你必須給人們他們想要的東西
You have to give the people what they want, Khaderbhai.

163
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,720
否則你會成為歷史
Otherwise, you are consigned to history.

164
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,150
也許我會在我的地盤 薩嘎爾瓦達的門前為你建一座大雕像
Maybe I'll build a big statue of you at the gates of my Sagar Wada, huh?

165
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,370
和你交談總是很愉快 瓦利德拜
Always a pleasure talking with you, Walidbhai.

166
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,360
你醒了 太好了 跟我來 有個東西你必須看看 老大
You're awake? Good. Come. Something you gotta see, boss.

167
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,230
好的 稍等片刻
All right. Just give me a minute.

168
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,490
快點啊 哥們
Come, na.

169
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,790
嗨
Hey.

170
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,960
他們在做什么
What are they all doing?

171
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,010
他們是你的病人
They're your patients.

172
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,590
你在說什么呢
What are you talking about?

173
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,840
他們都知道你昨晚治療居民的事
They all know about the doctoring you did last night,

174
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,300
所以現在排隊來看你
so now they wait to see you.

175
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,390
不...我可不是...
No. No. I'm not--

176
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,680
林 不會有問題的 林先生 -我不行
Lin, no-- no problem waiting, Linbaba. -I can't.

177
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,690
他們已經等了一個多小時了 我說你得睡覺
They're here more than one hour already. I told them you must sleep.

178
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,770
帕拉布
Prabhu.

179
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,320
就算你沒來 他們也會繼續等的
Even if you were not here, they would still be waiting

180
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,200
只是白等一場
but waiting for nothing only.

181
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,490
那會讓他們失去希望
And that kills the heart.

182
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,780
但是等待有所回報 那就不同了 對吧
But waiting for something, that is different, na?

183
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,490
我不能這么做 聽著 我都不算醫生
I can't do that. Look, I'm not even a doctor.

184
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,250
糟糕的醫生總比沒醫生好
Even bad doctor better than no doctor.

185
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,040
我不是說你糟糕 意思是即使你糟糕也沒事
I'm not saying you are bad, only that if you were, it would be okay.

186
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,460
林 拜托了
Lin, please.

187
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,680
帕拉布 -拉克什米原本就無法生還的
Prabhu. -Lakshmi was going to die anyway.

188
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,010
我們會為她悼念
And we will grieve her.

189
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,220
但有時生活就是這樣
But that is how it is sometimes.

190
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,980
帕拉布 你好嗎  -好
How are you, Prabhu? -Okay.

191
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,440
林先生
Mr. Lin.

192
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,030
聽著 關于昨晚 我想道歉 你是對的 我應該聽你的話
Look, I wanna say sorry about last night. You were right. I should have listened.

193
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,950
卡西姆 他會幫我們嗎
Qasim, is he going to help us?

194
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,550
我從沒這么想逃跑過
I wanted to run more than ever,

195
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,590
用卡拉的錢賦予我的第二次機會 就此離開孟買
take the second chance Karla's money had given me and get out of Bombay,

196
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,260
雖然我接受的幫助令這些人蒙受痛苦
despite what helping me had done to these people.

197
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,510
會很好的 相信我
It will be good, you'll see.

198
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,760
上帝保佑
God willing.

199
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,410
林先生 這筆錢不少啊
This is a lot of money to be giving away, Linbaba.

200
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,040
是的 我需要的東西也不少
Yeah, well, I'm gonna need a lot of things.

201
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,790
可你為什么要這么做
But why you do this?

202
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,660
我有我的原因
I've got my reasons.

203
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,040
來吧 收下 用這筆錢重建燒毀的屋子
Go on, take it. Use it to rebuild the homes that burned.

204
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,090
拜托你了
Please.

205
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,850
我會確保每分每毫都用在對的地方
I will make sure every paisa is well spent.

206
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,280
好了 再等兩分鐘 好嗎
All right! Just two more minutes. Okay?

207
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,360
好的
Okay.

208
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,300
涂抹一點這個 好吧
Put some of this on, all right?

209
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,720
只可能是我
It had to be me.

210
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,970
接受過相同培訓的人 不會因為犯罪而被迫躲在貧民區里
Another man with my training wouldn't have been forced by crime into the slum.

211
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,560
而罪犯不會像我一樣接受過醫療培訓
Another criminal wouldn't have had my training.

212
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,480
我不懂當中的幽默 我也不覺得這命運好笑在哪
I didn't get the joke, and fate didn't make me laugh.

213
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,690
但我知道我不能離開
But I knew I couldn't leave.

214
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,540
還有20個病人
We have 20 more patients.

215
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,290
好嗎 出來 好的
Okay? Out. Okay.

216
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,590
快點...
Let's go. Let's go.

217
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,670
嗨
Hi.

218
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,610
你得吃點東西
You need to eat.

219
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,290
早餐可真是豐盛啊
Breakfast of champions.

220
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,960
你有時候真幼稚
You can be such a child sometimes.

221
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,500
你是因為我幫你戒毒而生我氣嗎
Are you angry with me for helping you get clean?

222
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,670
生氣的人是你
You're the one who's angry.

223
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,640
總是要照顧我這點讓你這么生氣嗎
Does it piss you off so much that you have to look after me?

224
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,760
我希望你能照顧好自己 莉莎
I want you to look after yourself, Lisa.

225
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,180
但你不會的 因為你就喜歡自己孱弱無力
But you won't, because you like being powerless,

226
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,650
因為無論你身處哪一個宇宙 這讓你成為那里的中心
because it makes you the center of whatever universe you happen to be in.

227
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,860
有人照顧他人是出于愛
Some people look after you because they love you.

228
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,320
這又不是壞事
That's not a bad thing.

229
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,860
如果那人離開了呢
And what happens when they aren't there?

230
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,700
你不能一輩子拒絕關心某人
You can't spend your life refusing to care for anyone

231
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,780
只因他們可能離開
in case they leave.

232
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,490
莉莎 我不能和你吵 現在不行
I can't do this, Lisa. Not now.

233
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,330
現在的情況下 我不想和你爭執
I don't wanna fight with you, not with everything else.

234
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,090
對不起
I'm sorry.

235
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,590
你說得對 我的表現太自私 像個被寵壞的賤人
You're right. I'm being a selfish, spoiled bitch.

236
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,640
怎么了
What is it?

237
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:56,020
昨天我滿腦子都在想不能軟弱
Yesterday, all I could think about was not being weak.

238
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,870
現在我一閉眼 只看到死去的魯祖
And now, I close my eyes, and all I see is Rujul dead.

239
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,160
卡達爾知道
Khader knew.

240
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,950
他想保護我 但他做得越多
He tried to protect me, and the more he did,

241
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,420
我就越是堅定地想要證明自己能應對
the more I was determined to prove myself I could handle it.

242
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,000
卡拉 你不需要證明任何事的
You don't have to prove anything, Karla.

243
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,550
如果我不那么做 交易會失敗
If I don't, the deal will fall apart.

244
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,010
那有多糟呢
And would that be so bad?

245
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,970
你上次任自己放松 感到快樂 是什么時候
When is the last time you let yourself go and felt happy?

246
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,100
真正的快樂
Truly happy?

247
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,150
我們一起當廢物吧
Let's be fucked-up together.

248
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,650
我保證會吃一些 不對你犯渾
I promise to eat some of this and not be a royal pain in the ass,

249
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,610
只要你保證留在這陪我 和我一起聽唱片 像舊日一樣
if you promise to stay here with me and play records with me like old times

250
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,410
直到我們喝光了酒 嗑完了大麻
until we run out of booze and hash.

251
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,830
好的
Okay.

252
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,840
你需要休息 我可以讓他們明天再來
You are needing rest? I can tell them to come back tomorrow.

253
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,300
不 我沒事
No, I'm good.

254
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,480
停下 林醫生要休息一下
Stop! Dr. Lin will be taking a break now.

255
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,650
這是給你的謝禮 林醫生
This is a thank-you, Dr. Lin.

256
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,940
其實這是帕拉布的主意
Well, it was actually Prabhu's idea.

257
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,490
是我的主意
It was my idea.

258
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,070
他說服卡西姆阿里這么做 讓我用他的棚屋
He talked Qasim Ali into it and let me use his hut.

259
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,120
是我說服卡西姆阿里的
I talked Qasim Ali into it.

260
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,540
是帕拉布買來了所有這些物資
It was Prabhu who got all the supplies.

261
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,750
物資是我買的
I got the supplies.

262
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,090
帕拉布 你這么做真好
Prabhu, this was a good thing that you did.

263
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,470
你需要幫忙照料病人嗎
You need help with patients?

264
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,430
不用了 我們可以的 謝謝
No. We're good, thank you.

265
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,060
不過這個很好吃啊
This is great, though.

266
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,240
林先生 不錯吧 非常順利...
Very good, huh, Linbaba? Very slick, very smooth,

267
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,280
直到你讓她走 帕瓦蒂
until you sent her away. Parvati!

268
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,700
多謝你
Thank you, huh?

269
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,880
如果你想的話 吃完后 我可以把盤子送還你
If you like, I will bring back your tray when we are finished.

270
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,960
去奶茶店
At the chai shop.

271
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,460
你會在那里嗎
You'll be there?

272
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,800
我會在那里
I'll be there.

273
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,480
好啦 你們看什么呢 你們沒正事干嗎
All right, what are you staring at? Haven't you got work to do?

274
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,650
走吧
Let's go.

275
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,410
你看得有滋有味啊
You are enjoying, huh?

276
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,490
很美味...
Yummy, yummy.

277
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,060
宮殿的營運模式是預約制
The Palace operates on an appointment-only basis.

278
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,190
宮殿營運是因為我們允許它營運
The Palace operates because we let it.

279
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,520
告訴周說我們到了 去吧
Tell Zhou we're here. Go.

280
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:28,070
帕德瑪 我不是某個無助的女孩 會屈從你們的規矩
I'm not some helpless girl, Padma, that will bend to your discipline.

281
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,200
你必須把攜帶的武器留在這里
You will need to leave any weapons you carry here.

282
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,580
我不會
No, I won't.

283
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,680
卡德爾拜 太榮幸了 請問需要什么喝的或吃的嗎
This is an honor, Khaderbhai. Can I get you something to drink or eat?

284
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,680
最近我與魯祖阿德卡 進行了非常嚴肅的會面
Recently, I spent a solemn moment with Rujul Aadekar.

285
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,270
今晨我和瓦利德沙會面
This morning, I spent some time with Walid Shah.

286
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,820
現在 我來看你
And now, I've come to see you.

287
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,990
我不贊許你做的生意
I do not approve of your business,

288
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,530
但我理解這種生意必定會存在
but I understand it is a business that must exist.

289
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,030
所以你被允許來這里 蓬勃發展
So, you've been allowed to come here and prosper.

290
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,750
但是你的成功基于一個條件 就是中立
But there has been one condition to your success. Neutrality.

291
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,710
我犯了一個錯 卡德爾拜
I made a mistake, Khaderbhai.

292
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,880
我只能道歉
I can only apologize.

293
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,880
一開始我以為你知悉
At first, I assumed you knew of it.

294
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,970
但我意識到并非如此時 已經太晚了
When I realized this wasn't the case, it was too late.

295
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,690
正如你說 我在孟買本地的處境脆弱...
As you say, my position here in Bombay is vulnerable--

296
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,400
女士 你不太擅長扮演受害者
You do not play the victim well, Madame.

297
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:49,900
希望你從前當情婦和妓女時 假裝的功力更強一點
I hope you were better at faking back when you were a mistress and a whore.

298
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,740
正如我說的 我犯了一個錯
Like I said, I made a mistake.

299
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,990
但如果我要為此死去
But if I was going to die for it,

300
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:03,210
我認為你不會親自來這里動手
I don't think you would come here yourself to watch it happen.

301
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:09,420
死去的你對我毫無用處 活著的你也許有些用處
Dead, you are of no use to me. Alive, maybe I could use you.

302
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:14,260
你應明白 當我離開這地方時 我會帶上你的命
Understand that when I leave this place, I will take your life with me

303
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,260
作為你現在所欠債務的抵押品
as collateral against the debt that you now owe.

304
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,180
當我向你提出要求 你必須滿足
And when I ask something of you, you will do it,

305
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,890
否則這地方會成為你的葬身殿
or this place will burn as your funeral pyre.

306
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,940
你是怎么知道的
How did you know?

307
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,740
是卡拉薩蘭恩說的
Was it Karla Saaranen?

308
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,820
誰
Who?

309
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,910
我沒聽過這名字
I do not know that name.

310
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,120
魯祖是我的人
Rujul belonged to me.

311
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,330
我對他的了解勝過他對自己的了解
I knew him better than he knew himself.

312
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:47,210
所以我派人跟蹤他 他去過哪里 做了什么 見了誰
So I had him followed, where he went, what he did, who he saw.

313
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,590
他沒想到這一點是他愚蠢
He was stupid to think otherwise.

314
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,050
而他的愚蠢讓他送命
It was his stupidity that got him killed.

315
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,470
希望你并不愚蠢 女士
I hope you're not stupid, Madame.

316
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:39,050
林先生 我們要為拉克什米的葬禮造柴堆
Linbaba, we are now going to build the pyre for Lakshmi's funeral

317
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,720
歡迎你一起來
if you want to come.

318
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,640
對不起 強尼 我沒資格去
I'm sorry, Johnny. I got no right to be there.

319
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,140
帕拉布說你責怪自己
Prabhu told me you blame yourself.

320
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,650
帕拉布話太多了
Prabhu talks too much.

321
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,820
是
Yeah.

322
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:39,950
卡德爾拜今天饒了你一命 這么做明智嗎
Khaderbhai gave you your life today. Is this wise?

323
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,990
我的命不由任何人賜予或拿走
My life isn't any man's to give or take.

324
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,250
我和他們一樣了解他們的生意
I know their business as well as them.

325
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,080
這些“大哥”...去他們的
All these bhais... Fuck them.

326
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,500
也許是時候讓位給“大姐”了 帕德瑪
Maybe it's time for the behains, Padma.

327
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,720
我們之間有協定
We had a deal, you and I.

328
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,180
如果你說的是莉莎 我遵從了協定
If you're talking about Lisa, I kept my part of it.

329
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,350
莉莎離開了
Lisa is gone.

330
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,020
我不認為那是我的錯
I don't see how that is my fault.

331
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,890
毛里齊奧 那你在怕什么
Then why are you scared, Maurizio?

332
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,650
我不怕
I am not.

333
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,150
我認為你怕
I think you are.

334
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:21,660
我認為只有這種時候 男人和女人才能真正一樣
I think maybe it's the only time when men and women can truly be the same,

335
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,370
當他們無權無勢 害怕至極時
when they're powerless and terrified.

336
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,200
可是女人被迫擁有這種感受的時刻 比男人多得多
But women are forced to feel it so much more than men.

337
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,750
往往是被男人逼迫
By men, usually.

338
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,330
為什么叫我來這里
Why am I here?

339
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,800
你想得到我的原諒 有一個辦法
There is a way for you to earn my forgiveness.

340
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
請說
I'm listening.

341
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:46,010
我想要你在克拉巴幫我賣海洛因
I want you to sell brown sugar for me in Colaba.

342
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,980
克拉巴是卡德爾拜的地盤
Colaba is Khaderbhai's territory.

343
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,560
但他不在那里賣海洛因
But he doesn't sell heroin there.

344
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,730
其他人也沒有
Neither does anyone else.

345
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,480
我對他并沒有忠誠 你呢
I owe him no loyalty. Do you?

346
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,650
我
Me?

347
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,320
我對任何人都沒有忠誠
I owe loyalty to no one.

348
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,910
至少這是大實話
Which is honest, at least.

349
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,910
我的條件很簡單
My terms are simple.

350
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,410
不得提我的名字 你抽二成利潤
My name is never mentioned. You keep 20% of the profit.

351
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,750
四成 風險全由我承擔
Forty. I'm taking all of the risk.

352
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,210
我不是在和你磋商
I'm not negotiating with you.

353
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,640
大概有多少
How much are we talking about?

354
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,100
你能賣多少 我就有多少阿富汗海洛因
I have access to as much Afghan dope as you can sell.

355
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,980
好的 說定了
Okay then. You have a deal.

356
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,020
那你就不需要害怕任何事了
Then you have nothing to fear.

357
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,740
林先生
Mr. Lin?

358
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,450
我叫阿卜杜拉塔哈利
My name's Abdullah Taheri.

359
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,040
有個人想見你
I have someone who wants to meet you.

360
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,290
好的 誰
Okay. Who is it?

361
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,670
請
Please.

362
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,440
林賽福特先生
Mr. Lindsay Ford?

363
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,690
叫我林就好
Just "Lin" works.

364
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,360
見到你很高興 久仰大名
I'm pleased to meet you. I've heard good things.

365
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,160
在孟買這里聽到關于外國人的好話 總是令人開心
It's always nice to hear good things about foreigners here in Bombay.

366
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,000
也許你也聽過我 我是阿布戴爾卡達爾可汗
You might have heard of me also. My name is Abdel Khader Khan.

367
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,880
你現在是棚屋區醫生了
So, you are the doctor in the hutments now.

368
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,170
這個 我...距離醫生還遠著呢
Well, I'm-- I'm a long way from being a doctor.

369
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,630
也許正是因此你才這么出色
Well, maybe that is why you are doing so well.

370
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,300
醫生不會主動來貧民區
Doctors do not go into the jhopadpatti willingly.

371
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,060
我們可以說服人不做壞事
We can compel men not to be bad,

372
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,020
但我們無法說服他們做好事 你不覺得嗎
but we cannot compel them to do good, don't you find?

373
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,100
我從沒思考過這點
I never really thought about it.

374
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,770
不知道什么東西能說服你
I wonder what compels you.

375
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,490
有什么能幫你的嗎
Is there something I can do for you?

376
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,990
我還不知道
I don't know yet.

377
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,200
所以我才來這里
That is why I am here,

378
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,490
邀請你和我的朋友阿卜杜拉聊聊
to invite you to spend some time with me and my friend Abdullah.

379
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,830
好吧 我無意冒犯 但是我就直說了
All right. I mean no offense, but I'm just gonna say this.

380
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,960
你的名聲挺嚇人的
You have a fairly scary reputation.

381
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:27,930
所以你突然這樣出現 應該不難理解我有點緊張
So you just turning up like this, you can see why I might be a bit nervous

382
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:31,090
不太想坐上你車的后座 讓你載我走
about jumping in the back of your car and letting you drive me away.

383
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,680
我向你保證 今晚你不會受到任何傷害
I give you my word. No harm will come to you this night.

384
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,350
我有選擇嗎
Do I have a choice?

385
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,100
你永遠都有選擇
You always have a choice.

386
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:44,860
最終 我認為選擇是我們唯一擁有的東西
In the end, I think that is all we have.

387
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,200
好吧
Okay.

388
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,240
宵禁就像不存在一樣
So much for curfew.

389
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,660
當局知道
The authorities know

390
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:40,040
大城市的文明人需要聚會和謀生的地方
that civilized people in large cities need places to gather and hunt.

391
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:45,000
所以某些地方可以行賄 秩序得以被保留
So certain establishments are permitted to pay a bribe, and order is preserved.

392
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,960
明面上法律依然有效 但不會執行
Officially, the law remains. It's just not enforced.

393
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,630
誰決定哪些法律要執行 哪些法律不執行呢
Who gets to decide which laws get enforced and which ones don't?

394
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,140
有人曾說腐敗作為管治系統的一部分 最糟糕的一點在于
Someone once said the worst thing about corruption as a system of governance

395
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,850
它的效果太好了
is that it works so well.

396
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
拉米什
Ramesh!

397
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,490
你父親可好
How is your father?

398
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:16,200
他很好 卡德爾拜 謝謝
He is well, Khaderbhai. Thank you.

399
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,620
但我遇到了麻煩
But I am having a problem.

400
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,750
告訴我
Tell me.

401
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,250
先生 是關于我的房東
Bhai, it's about my landlord.

402
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:24,460
他已經要求租金漲一倍
He is demanding double rent already.

403
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:29,840
他想驅逐我們 不只是我 還有樓里的所有家庭
He wants to evict us, not just me, but all the families in my building.

404
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,430
他有打手 他的打手把我們打得很慘
He has goondas, and his goondas beat us badly.

405
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,140
甚至包括我的父親
Even my own father.

406
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,560
那么你父親并不好
Then he is not well.

407
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,940
是的 先生 他的自尊心太強 不愿向你求助
No, sir. He is too proud to ask you for help

408
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,270
不想打擾你
and doesn't want to disturb your peace.

409
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,060
可是我...
But I...

410
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,440
你是個好兒子
You're a good son.

411
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,900
我們不會做任何傷害他自尊心的事
We won't do anything to hurt his pride.

412
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,570
也毋須和你父親提及這次談話
And there will be no need to speak to your father about this

413
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,740
直到這個麻煩解決 愿上帝保佑
until the problem is solved, inshallah.

414
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,700
謝謝你... -好的 是...
Thank you, thank-- -Okay, okay. Yes, yes, yes.

415
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,120
你聽懂了多少
How much did you understand?

416
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,590
沒多少 關于他家和他父親什么的
Not much. Something about his home and his father.

417
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,800
他們的房東想趕走他們
Their landlord wants them out of their place.

418
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,260
必要時會動粗
By force, if necessary.

419
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,300
所以你去威脅那個威脅他們的人
So you threaten the man who threatens them?

420
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,140
你贊同嗎
Do you approve?

421
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,310
我覺得你并不需要我的贊同
I don't think you need my approval.

422
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,230
你是阿布戴爾卡達爾可汗
You're Abdel Khader Khan.

423
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,820
只因為我可以輕易做某事 不意味著我應該這么做
Just because I can easily do something doesn't always mean I should.

424
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,440
如果換做是你 你覺得應該這樣做嗎
Humor me. If it were you?

425
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,870
我覺得如果我喜歡拉米什 而這個房東的做法很過分
I think if I liked Ramesh and this landlord was out of line,

426
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,580
那我會盡我所能幫助他
then I'd do what I could for him.

427
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,250
就算那可能違法
Even if it meant acting against the law?

428
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,040
誰決定哪些法律要執行 哪些法律不執行呢
Who gets to choose which laws get enforced and which ones don't?

429
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:56,840
最終 無論是哪條法律 無論是誰來選擇
In the end, regardless of laws or who chooses,

430
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,180
我們每一個人 每個宇宙 每個星系中的每個原子
each one of us, every atom in every galaxy in every universe,

431
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,060
都會向上帝靠近
is moving towards God.

432
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,190
我不信上帝
I don't believe in God.

433
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:13,280
那么我們能聊的就更多了 你和我
Then we have much more to talk about, you and I.

434
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,740
走 我們帶他去俱樂部
Let's go. We will take him to the club.

435
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,210
你說了會陪我 -不 我只是沒說不會陪
You said you'd stay with me. -No. I just didn't say I wouldn't.

436
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,050
你的協定
Your deal.

437
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,800
莉莎 我已經走到這一步 我沒有選擇
I've come too far, Lisa. I don't have a choice.

438
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,600
可不能讓卡達爾可汗先生失望
Can't disappoint Mr. Khader Khan.

439
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,270
留下 求你了
Stay. Please.

440
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,610
為了我們倆
For both of us.

441
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,780
我能看出這給你帶來的影響 你也知道
I can see what this is doing to you. You know it too.

442
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,280
你只是不愿承認
You just won't admit it.

443
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,410
選擇我 陪著我
Choose me. Stay with me.

444
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,200
因為這才是最重要的
Because this matters the most.

445
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,040
我很在乎你 你清楚的
I care about you. You know that.

446
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,130
但你還是要選他
But you're choosing him anyway.

447
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,440
這家俱樂部有孟買最棒的加扎勒歌手
This club has the best ghazel singers in Bombay.

448
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,400
什么是加扎勒
What are ghazels?

449
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,480
愛之曲 給上帝的愛之曲
Love songs. Love songs to God.

450
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,280
無論你怎么想 信上帝這件事并不存在
No matter what you might think, there is no believing in God.

451
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,410
我們認識上帝 或不認識 只有這兩種
We either know him or we do not.

452
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:32,000
我不認識上帝 但我覺得 他的存在不太可能
Well, I don't know God, but I think he's pretty much impossible.

453
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,580
上帝的存在不太可能正是他存在的證據
The fact that God is impossible is proof he exists.

454
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,090
所以是不是所有可能的事物都不存在呢
So does that mean that all possible things don't exist?

455
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,050
很高興你理解我的意思
I'm delighted you understand.

456
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,880
我真的不理解
I really don't.

457
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,590
我的朋友 你有麻煩了
You're in trouble now, my friend.

458
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:48,640
沒有任何事物是我們所看到的樣子 我們的眼睛是騙子
Nothing exists as we see it. Our eyes are liars.

459
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,140
一切看上去真實的東西都屬于某種幻象
Everything that seems real is part of the illusion.

460
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,640
你 我 這個房間
You, me, this room.

461
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:59,860
那么如果一切都是幻象 那我們怎么知道做什么 如何生活
So if everything's an illusion, how do we know what to do, how to live?

462
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,740
我們說謊
We lie.

463
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,780
頭腦清醒的人不過是比 頭腦不清醒的人更擅長說謊罷了
The sane man is simply a better liar than the insane man.

464
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,160
你的眼睛會說謊
Your eyes lie.

465
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,830
你以為自己知道的事情 讓你認為并非如此 那其實這是真的
What you think you know tells you this is not so, but it's true.

466
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:16,380
我們更喜歡謊言 因為那樣更簡單
We prefer the lie because it's easier.

467
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,130
那要如何保持清醒
That's how we stay sane?

468
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:25,930
我沒有結婚 我沒有兒子
I am not married, and I have no sons.

469
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,100
但如果我告訴你 我清楚地看到你是我的兒子
But if I tell you that I see it clearly that you are my son,

470
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,810
阿卜杜拉是你的哥哥 我是你的父親
Abdullah is your brother, I am your father,

471
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,310
你會認為這不可能
you will think that is impossible.

472
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:38,730
你會抗拒 你確實如此 我看得出
You will resist it. You do. I see it.

473
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:43,860
你寧肯相信我們都是陌生人這個謊言
You prefer to believe the lie that we are all strangers,

474
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,450
相信我們之間沒有關連
and there is no connection between us.

475
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,780
我有父親
I have a father.

476
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,700
我不了解你 你不了解我
And I don't know you. You don't know me.

477
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,580
也許我了解
I think maybe I do.

478
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,260
林先生 你會對自己說哪些謊言
What do you lie to yourself about, Mr. Lin?

479
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,260
我不會 我已經不再那樣做了
I don't. I'm finished with that.

480
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:14,140
我知道自己是誰 做了什么 欠了什么
I know what I am, what I've done, what I owe.

481
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,900
我決定喜歡林這個人

482
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,530
你覺得這音樂如何
How did you like the music?

483
00:42:56,530 --> 00:43:00,200
棒極了 從沒聽過這樣的音樂
It's incredible. I never heard anything like it before.

484
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,660
能問你一件事嗎
Can I ask you something?

485
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,710
今晚的所有這些...你為什么帶我來這里
All this, tonight... Why'd you bring me here?

486
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,040
你想在我這里得到什么
What do you want from me?

487
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,010
你在這里做什么
What are you doing here?

488
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,340
聽音樂 喝茶
Listening, drinking tea,

489
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:22,640
學習我所知道的世界是一種幻象這件事
learning that the world as I know it is an illusion.

490
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,060
我嗑嗨了
I'm pretty stoned.

491
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,980
你本應離開孟買的
You were meant to leave Bombay.

492
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:30,020
林先生 你的這位朋友是
Who is your friend, Mr. Lin?

493
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,150
這是卡拉薩蘭恩
This is Karla Saaranen.

494
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:34,820
我們是朋友嗎
Are we friends?

495
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,950
不知道
I don't know.

496
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:42,530
這么說吧 到目前我在孟買的日子里 卡拉是重要而關鍵的一部分
Let's just say Karla has had a full and central part of my life in Bombay so far.

497
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,700
無論是真是假
Real or not.

498
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,040
我覺得她是真的
I think she's real.

499
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,620
事實上
In fact,

500
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,340
卡拉證明了我是對的
Karla proves that I'm right.

501
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,590
如果我想象出了她 她對我的態度應該好得多
If I invented her, she would be a lot nicer to me.

502
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:58,180
卡拉 這位是阿卜杜拉塔哈利
Karla, allow me to introduce Abdullah Taheri,

503
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,180
他似乎是我沒有血緣關系的兄弟
my brother from another mother, apparently,

504
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,680
我的新相識阿布戴爾卡達爾可汗先生 讓我們兩兄弟再聚首
recently reunited by my newest acquaintance, Mr. Abdel Khader Khan.

505
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:06,810
你大概聽過他的大名 -當然
You've probably heard of him. -Of course.

506
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:09,100
薩拉恩女士 幸會
It's a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Saaranen.

507
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:12,150
彼此彼此 你們是怎么認識的
Likewise. How do you all come to know each other?

508
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,900
命運使然
Fate saw fit to throw us together.

509
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,530
還真有趣
Funny how that happens.

510
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,450
是的 “處于苦難中的人不擇伙伴”
Yeah, well, "Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows."

511
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,870
怪物是誰
Who's the monster?

512
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,830
什么意思
What do you mean?

513
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:27,410
這句話是一個和怪物同床的人說的
That line is spoken by a man who lies down with a monster.

514
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,410
薩蘭恩女士對莎士比亞很了解
Ms. Saaranen knows her Shakespeare.

515
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,500
有人曾告訴我
Someone once told me

516
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,170
人生中的所有問題和大部分答案
that all the questions and most of the answers in life

517
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,710
都可以在莎士比亞里找到
can be found in Shakespeare.

518
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,670
要加入我們嗎
Would you like to join us?

519
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,760
不行 我還有客人要招待
I can't. I've got guests of my own.

520
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,930
我們要談生意 我應該回去了
We have business to conclude. I should get back to them.

521
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,310
祝你的生意順利
Good luck with your business.

522
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:48,270
愿上帝保佑
Inshallah.

523
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,850
祝你們今晚愉快 先生們
Enjoy the rest of your evening, gentlemen.

524
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:05,890
林 今晚很愉快
It has been a pleasure, Lin.

525
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,520
這是某種考驗嗎
Was this some kind of test?

526
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,520
你為什么在薩嘎爾瓦達幫忙
Why do you help in Sagar Wada?

527
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,900
他們需要
They needed it.

528
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,820
那算是某種高尚舉動
An act of nobility then?

529
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,650
不 高尚這個詞用不到我身上 這我可以打包票
Nah, there's nothing noble about me. You can trust me on that.

530
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,660
人沒有好壞之分
There are no good men or bad men.

531
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:30,290
是他們做的事或不愿做的事 定義了他們的好壞
It is what they do, or refuse to do, that makes them good or evil.

532
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,160
這個地方對我的意義重大
This place means a great deal to me.

533
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,050
可汗先生 多謝你今晚的招待
Thank you for tonight, Mr. Khan.

534
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:44,340
請叫我卡德爾拜
Please, call me Khaderbhai.

535
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,720
卡德爾拜
Khaderbhai.

536
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:49,930
發音還算標準
Close enough.

537
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,650
也許是命運 讓我和這兩個人相遇 父親和兄弟
Maybe fate brought me together with these men, father and brother.

538
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,530
但那之后發生的一切都是我自己的選擇
But everything that came after was down to my own choices,

539
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,160
正如卡達爾說的
just like Khader had said.

540
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,660
你殺了她 你殺了我的母親
You took her away. You took my mother away.

541
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,040
她是我的全部
She was all I had.

542
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:39,790
是
Yeah.

543
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,710
雖然是無心之失 但的確如此
I didn't mean to, but I did.

544
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,050
拉維 我受夠了永遠做錯事
I'm tired, Ravi, of getting it so fucking wrong all the time.

545
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,220
你要用這個嗎
Are you gonna use that?

546
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,600
拉維
Ravi!

547
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,020
拉維 你在做什么
What are you doing, Ravi?

548
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:09,740
拉維 孩子
Ravi, my son...

549
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,950
你母親已經離世
Your mother is gone.

550
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:18,040
這么做 你也會毀了自己的一輩子
Do this, and you'll lose yourself forever also.

551
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,040
你明白嗎
Understand?

552
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,960
這孩子不應該
This child does not deserve

553
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,170
因為殺了你而背負良心的重擔 林先生
to carry your murder on his conscience, Mr. Lin.

554
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,920
你不懂這一點說明你是個自私的傻瓜
And you are a selfish fool for not knowing better.

555
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:39,310
去我的棚屋 你和我家人一起生活吧
Go to my hut. You will stay with my family now.

556
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,060
不 卡西姆叔叔 拜托 我不傷他 但...
No. Uncle Qasim, please. I won't hurt him, but...

557
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:45,230
拉維 聽我的話
Ravi. Do as I say.

558
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:46,570
去吧
Go.

559
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,860
你對他說了什么
What did you say to him?

560
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:53,450
他現在和我家人一起生活
That he will stay with my family now.

561
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,160
拉克什米的棚屋屬于你了 林先生
Lakshmi's hut will now be yours, Mr. Lin.

562
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:05,130
這里的人需要你的幫助時 就會來這里找你
When people here need your help, this is where they will find you.

563
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,800
這不是我給你的禮物
This is not a gift I'm giving you.

564
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,760
是
Yeah.

565
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:42,370
