1
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,728
Your share.

2
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:26,026
And a passport. And I paid for it meself.

3
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,029
Only seemed fair.

4
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,369
Looks like they put you through it.

5
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,625
I knew something they wanted to know,

6
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,294
didn't I, Charlie?

7
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,754
Fucking hell, Dale.

8
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,465
You want me to say thank you?

9
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,260
Then fuck yes. Thank you.

10
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,848
You wanna hit me?
Go on. Punch me in the kisser.

11
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:58,851
I fucked myself.

12
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:06,733
But now, if I'm free,
then I'm free to go where I wanted

13
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,404
before I was stupid enough
to mess around with you.

14
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,207
A fucking Kiwi?

15
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,543
It was the best I could do
on short notice.

16
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,503
Okay.

17
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:27,880
Know where you're gonna go?

18
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:30,966
Yeah.

19
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:35,512
Gonna go find yourself, Dale?

20
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:40,100
No. I'm gonna lose myself.

21
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,706
Oi.

22
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,417
You. You need hospital?

23
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,211
No. No hospital.

24
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,759
I'm fine.

25
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:30,275
This is the most capable night manager

26
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,445
in this, the... the best,
cheapest hotel in all of Colaba.

27
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,697
Yaar, Prabhu,
do you realize what time it is?

28
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,284
I don't want any more fucking goras
this late.

29
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,119
But they're very tired

30
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,288
and would appreciate
being checked into the room.

31
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,915
Take them, please.

32
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,627
- I'll do it because it's you.
- Then do it.

33
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,089
- Okay. Fill it in.
- Thank you very much.

34
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,883
This man says he is a hotel guest?

35
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,093
Who?

36
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,887
This man says he is a hotel guest.
Is this true?

37
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:00,764
Yes, he is a guest.

38
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:01,932
What is his name?

39
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,660
- Just a second. It's in the register.
- Let me see.

40
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,228
- I'll show you, sir.
- Give it to me.

41
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,773
Show me his C-Form.

42
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,025
C-Form, it would be over here.

43
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:21,076
The bastard has been fighting
and does not want the hospital.

44
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,079
- Oh, yeah?
- Come on. Why does it take so long?

45
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,166
What happened?
This pandu is a full motherfucker.

46
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,128
If you don't bribe him,
he'll take you to jail. What happened?

47
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,296
I got mugged.

48
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,049
They took everything,
even my fucking boots.

49
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,384
Everything?

50
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,969
I just need to lie down.

51
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,722
Show me his room. Now.

52
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,809
- Lin. No passport, no money…
- What are you doing?

53
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,228
…Is very, very big problem in Bombay.

54
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,272
We have to go now. Lin, let's go.

55
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,233
- Hurry up!
- Yes, sir.

56
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,403
This is the room.

57
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,189
Okay.

58
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,359
Yes, sir.

59
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:50,374
Okay. Here is water.

60
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,398
Now I see why you're carrying
this impressive medicine box.

61
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,528
You should also be carrying
more than one pair of shoes, na?

62
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,877
Best medicine.

63
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:51,894
Tomorrow, first thing,
I will take you New Zealand consulate.

64
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:55,063
They will give you new passport, money.

65
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,732
I can't go to the authorities.

66
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,403
It's not an option for me.

67
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,033
Okay.

68
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,494
Please. Come. Eat, na.

69
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,496
You are my guest,

70
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,876
and Lakshmi, my neighbor, she is making…

71
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,962
…first-class roti.

72
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,632
Thank you.

73
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,021
Good, huh?

74
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,024
- Wow. It is very spicy.
- Mmm.

75
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,908
Dhanayavaad, for everything.

76
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:56,124
Mmm. I don't know about you,
but I need a drink.

77
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,546
What is that?

78
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,924
It's been three weeks. I still don't know
which waggle means what.

79
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,218
Okay.

80
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:10,556
Right now it is meaning, "Certainly,
by all means, I'll drink with you."

81
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,351
But it can also mean "no." Or "hello."

82
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,271
Or, "I understand."

83
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:23,986
Or even, "I am a man of peace,
so please do not be hurting me."

84
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,321
And you could learn this, huh?

85
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:29,199
Then this won't happen,
this won't happen, that won't happen.

86
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,159
After you.

87
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:41,587
Mmm.

88
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,760
Oi, take it easy.

89
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,724
So good.

90
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,434
Very, very smooth, yaar.

91
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,103
Okay.

92
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,399
Hey, man.

93
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,820
Keep it.

94
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,911
Is there a problem?

95
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,663
No. Just…

96
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,667
If I was knowing this was my whiskey
and not yours,

97
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:26,298
I would not have been so generous
with myself in drinking it, na.

98
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,675
Really?

99
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,645
- What are you doing?
- Wh... Hey!

100
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,193
Are you crazy?

101
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,740
This shirt was cleaned today only, yaar.

102
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,081
Take it.

103
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:01,667
It's for you.

104
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:05,838
Really?

105
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,684
Dale!

106
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,361
You fucking dog.

107
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:56,990
Back to where you belong.

108
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:05,415
Someone once told me that
a dream is where a wish and fear meet.

109
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,129
When the wish and the fear are the same,
we call the dream a nightmare.

110
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,774
You sure it was Rujul?

111
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,694
Fat and shiny, a lot of gold.

112
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,822
Stubby fingers, little mushroom cock.

113
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,659
And I heard his name,

114
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,579
when Walid was cheering him on.

115
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,459
And you're sure Rujul promised Walid

116
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,919
the Sagar Wada slum land?

117
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:54,631
Yeah.

118
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,760
We were their entertainment,
a way for them to seal their deal.

119
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:11,440
The other girl, Sunny, understood it all,

120
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,567
who they were, what they were doing.

121
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,362
Rujul and Walid didn't give a shit
if we heard.

122
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:24,661
Then Sunny disappeared,
and Zhou wouldn't let me leave.

123
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,181
Had to bribe that maid to come tell you.

124
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,420
She's dead, isn't she? Sunny.

125
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,717
I'd be the same if I didn't know you.

126
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,695
They all stared at me
with such intensity,

127
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,113
that I thought they must hate me.

128
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:44,575
Now I know
they were simply staring at my fear.

129
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:48,370
It's what people know about themselves
that makes them afraid.

130
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,170
Excuse me. Where's the toilet?

131
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,047
Huh?

132
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,100
How much shouting and yelling
you were doing last night?

133
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:13,562
Bad dreams, na?
That is why I let you sleep this morning.

134
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,772
Great.
Listen, I really need to go to the...

135
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,733
Hey! Lin, this is Lakshmi.

136
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,651
She made the roti
we were eating last night.

137
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:23,363
Oh, hi. Hey. Thank you. Was delicious.

138
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:30,996
Where are we?

139
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,457
This is the Sagar Wada jhopadpatti.

140
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,833
My home.

141
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:37,169
We are the not-people,

142
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:42,257
and these hutments are the not-houses
where we are not living.

143
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:50,807
Whose are they?

144
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,021
Her husband. He's gone.

145
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,775
I can't take her dead husband's shoes.

146
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,736
Not dead, Linbaba.

147
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,447
Gone to Dubai only, for the work there.

148
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:11,828
Thank you. Thank you.

149
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:19,294
- I really do need to shit.
- Let us go.

150
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:20,754
Hurry.

151
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,260
It's good?

152
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:46,363
You mind?

153
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,865
If you think it helps.

154
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:50,450
Can't make it worse.

155
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,578
You said you want to quit.

156
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:59,334
You know what'll happen
if you tell Khaderbhai about Rujul, right?

157
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,463
I'm out now.

158
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:06,592
We could stay quiet.

159
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:09,678
If Rujul's betraying us, then
I've worked the last year for nothing.

160
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,430
You would've let me rot in the Palace

161
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:14,193
if I hadn't known something
that threatened your precious land deal.

162
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,935
You used me.

163
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,897
How are you any different
than Maurizio and Modena?

164
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,732
Or maybe you're the one doing the using.

165
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:24,818
You don't give a shit about Rujul.

166
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:27,112
The drugs, me, those guys,

167
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:30,991
just a way to pass the buck and take
no responsibility for yourself whatsoever.

168
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,546
How are you doing, Arun? Johnny?

169
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,632
Prabhu.

170
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,011
- I'll help them.
- You won't. I'll go.

171
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:53,680
Go clean the table.

172
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,808
Do you want something?

173
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:59,228
Chai and roti for us both, please.

174
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:00,604
How you going?

175
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:02,814
Come. Sit.

176
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:10,071
Sit, na. Nandita is making
world best chai in all Bombay. Trust me.

177
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,156
Okay.

178
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,369
Arre, thank you, Kaaki. Thank you.

179
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,204
Thank you.

180
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,669
Who's the gora?

181
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,257
- He is my new business partner.
- Business partner?

182
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,385
Mmm. We are going to be working together
in the tourist business.

183
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,472
Parvati?

184
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:36,723
I'm coming!

185
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:40,477
- What did you say to her?
- That you are my good friend.

186
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,357
That is Parvati,
and I am determined to marry her, Linbaba.

187
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,234
That's your girlfriend?

188
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,069
I did not say she was my girlfriend.

189
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,780
This is the first time
we've ever spoken words to each other.

190
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,825
You've never spoken to her before?

191
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,994
It is a momentous day.

192
00:17:58,245 --> 00:17:59,997
Well, glad I could be here to see it.

193
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:04,626
Listen, mate.
I need to figure out my situation.

194
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,046
Mmm. You can't go to your authorities.

195
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,382
- Shut the fuck...
- But you are needing money, yes?

196
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:14,052
I have been thinking to help you
get it very fast.

197
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:16,680
What about the train tickets?
To your village.

198
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,974
You still have them, right?
Can we sell them?

199
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:23,604
Very difficult to sell tickets for a train
that has already left the station. No.

200
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:28,525
I think it is best idea
to become business partners. Hmm?

201
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,360
To be Bombay guides together.

202
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,738
- I'm not staying, Prabhu.
- Just think, Linbaba.

203
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:34,883
- So much money will be coming.
- I just need to get to Karla.

204
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:38,076
- Listen to me, please. We could both be...
- I can't, Prabhu.

205
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:49,171
Hey. Hey.

206
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:54,176
Thank you for last night. All right?

207
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,637
You were a lifesaver. You really were.

208
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,615
But I'm not staying here and hustling,
all right?

209
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:01,016
It's just not gonna happen. All right?

210
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:06,522
All right.
I'll be back for my stuff later.

211
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,080
Karla, it's Lin.

212
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:26,416
Karla, you there? I need to talk to you.

213
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,216
- What happened?
- Madame Zhou figured it out.

214
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,510
They almost killed me.

215
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,181
They took my money,
my passport, everything.

216
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,853
- I warned you it was dangerous.
- You did, yeah. Now I'm fucked.

217
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:47,312
Then go to your embassy.

218
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:50,649
I can't.

219
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,026
How is that my problem?

220
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,572
Seriously?

221
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:59,825
Karla, I don't understand
why you're being like this.

222
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:00,909
I'm asking for help.

223
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:05,247
Karla, you need to fucking help me.

224
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:07,332
I don't need to do anything.

225
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,710
I have somewhere to be.

226
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:15,716
Is she for real?

227
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,595
You look like a man who needs a drink.

228
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:26,143
I know you didn't give me
all the dope last night.

229
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,616
Now it's up to me, not her.

230
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:49,583
Karla can spot them a mile away.

231
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:51,877
Who?

232
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,212
People she can use.

233
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:56,215
She didn't force me to do anything.

234
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:59,551
Didn't need to. It's her gift.

235
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:03,722
What's so special about Karla anyway?

236
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:07,351
I'm as beautiful as she is, aren't I?

237
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,480
I feel even better than I look.

238
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:12,731
Don't.

239
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,860
Lisa, you don't have to do that.

240
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:19,321
Maybe I wanna feel good.

241
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:24,076
Don't you? We can feel good together.

242
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:26,870
- Lisa.
- Hmm?

243
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,374
You're shit-faced.

244
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:40,384
Why do men like bitches?

245
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:42,135
It's true.

246
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:46,849
They fall over women
who treat them like shit.

247
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:48,267
Can't get enough of it.

248
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,398
This fucking sucks.

249
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,235
You never tried to quit before?

250
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:03,699
I like being high.

251
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,995
I like there being some distance.

252
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:11,874
I'm not good with life stuff.

253
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,251
Never have been.

254
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,047
Maybe Karla left that
'cause she knew you'd find it.

255
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:22,593
Fuck, you're right.

256
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:27,222
I take this, she can throw me out.

257
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,311
You're not as dumb as you look, Lin.

258
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:36,982
I'm gonna puke.

259
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:49,912
How long is it this bad?

260
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:51,413
Few days.

261
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:53,916
And then it gets better?

262
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,126
It does.

263
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,308
You don't miss it?

264
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,228
Every day.

265
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,136
Khaderbhai.

266
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,390
Salaam alaikum.

267
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:52,933
Alaikumu assalam.

268
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:57,646
It's good to see you. Please.

269
00:23:58,438 --> 00:23:59,439
Thank you.

270
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:06,154
Is everything all right?
You said it was urgent.

271
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:09,950
I went to the Palace last night.

272
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:14,705
Your hate for Zhou is a wound that will
never heal if you keep picking at it.

273
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,165
Zhou was holding my friend Lisa prisoner.

274
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:18,584
Because of what Lisa knew.

275
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:22,337
We're being betrayed.

276
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:31,638
Our business together has been
the usual Bombay dhanda.

277
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:34,725
Bribes and understandings,
what everyone expects.

278
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:39,271
But I have other business. You know this.

279
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:43,233
Out of respect and affection for you,

280
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:47,029
I've never asked you to cross the line
between my two worlds, Karla.

281
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:51,867
- Are you certain?
- I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

282
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,454
I mean, you must be certain
that you are ready

283
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:58,957
for what telling me
about this betrayal means.

284
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:04,254
If I don't tell you what I know,
then you'll suffer.

285
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:06,965
Instead, you would suffer for me.

286
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,551
You've done so much for me.

287
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:11,094
There is no debt between us.

288
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:15,891
Love has no accounting or ledger
or quid pro quo.

289
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:21,438
We invest it because our heart insists
without any demand of return.

290
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:28,362
And this is the lesson, above all others,
you still need to learn, Karla.

291
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:38,413
Rujul Aadekar has been meeting
with Walid Shah.

292
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:43,877
He will accept Walid's bid for Sagar Wada,
not ours.

293
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:53,470
You better not be wrong about this.

294
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:22,833
Thank you.

295
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:28,255
I don't know why people can't be nicer.

296
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:31,633
Was it a girl?

297
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:34,928
Turned you on to heroin the first time?

298
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:37,514
Who was she?

299
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:40,392
Oh, it doesn't matter.

300
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:43,854
It's always love
that sends us down the rabbit hole.

301
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:54,990
Are you scared?

302
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,451
Trust you.

303
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:07,878
Once we have the money to go to India,
we can do this every day.

304
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:17,304
We're gonna have
such an amazing time, baby.

305
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:33,654
Do me a favor? Get rid of that shit.

306
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:35,614
Sure.

307
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:41,954
- Lisa. Hey.
- Hmm?

308
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,665
Who's Rujul Aadekar?

309
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:48,210
Forget you ever heard that.

310
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:49,503
Tell me.

311
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,296
No. Leave that alone.

312
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:56,218
You're helping me. I'm helping you.

313
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,150
The Palace is allowed to exist
because it has never taken sides.

314
00:28:12,234 --> 00:28:15,863
Zhou will be reminded of the grace
under which she operates.

315
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,993
Tell me about this man who helped you.

316
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,204
His name is Lin Ford.

317
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:27,875
I knew he was about to leave town,
so I used him to get Lisa out.

318
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:30,836
You must have trusted him.
That is no small thing for you.

319
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,672
I was in a hurry. He fit the bill.

320
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:38,886
Does he know about Rujul?

321
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:41,930
He heard the name. Nothing more.

322
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:43,682
Has no idea what any of it means.

323
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:47,060
But a smart and resourceful man
might decide to ask.

324
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:54,985
Okay, okay. I'll see you soon.
Thank you, thank you.

325
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:57,321
Pleasure. Pleasure.
And we do it like this, yeah?

326
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:58,405
Hey.

327
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,909
What happened to your face?

328
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:03,285
I got mugged.

329
00:29:04,453 --> 00:29:05,787
- Wow.
- I need new papers.

330
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:09,082
Why are you asking me?

331
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:11,543
'Cause you are the biggest crook I know
in Bombay.

332
00:29:11,627 --> 00:29:13,462
- No offense.
- Uh, none taken.

333
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:16,507
And I can assume,
for reasons I need not know,

334
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,383
that your consulate is not an option?

335
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:21,762
Bien sûr. Or you wouldn't need a crook.

336
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:25,015
I need to buy a passport.
You said you know the guy.

337
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:27,976
Abdel Khader Khan controls
the book business in Bombay.

338
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,937
Well, can you set me up with him?

339
00:29:30,604 --> 00:29:33,774
If they sold my passport to him,
maybe he'd sell it back to me.

340
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:38,820
Have you read The Godfather, Lin?

341
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:42,950
- I've seen the film.
- That is Khader Khan.

342
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:45,452
This is not a man
with whom you just get set up.

343
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:47,597
What would you offer him?
You said you have no money.

344
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:51,166
A good passport, one worth having,
will cost a thousand dollars.

345
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,001
A thousand dollars.

346
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:56,129
Ah, come on.
There must be something I can do.

347
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:57,881
No one knows this place like you do.

348
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:00,968
I thought we were friends.

349
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:05,472
I do not have friends.
Times like this are exactly why.

350
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:08,684
Well, I gotta do something.

351
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:11,854
You know,
I slept in a fucking slum last night.

352
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:13,856
As did half of Bombay.

353
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:23,448
Do you know a guy called Rujul Aadekar?
Or Ah-dee-kuhr.

354
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:25,158
Yeah, he's a local politician.

355
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:28,662
Well, he's involved with some shady shit
at the Palace, Madame Zhou's place...

356
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:29,746
Just... Keep your...

357
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,141
Maybe that information
would be worth something to someone.

358
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:36,211
- Could you just ask around?
- Keep your voice down.

359
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:38,463
Fuck that. I want my freedom back, Didier.

360
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:40,340
I don't care if I screw over Zhou, Karla…

361
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:41,675
Will you calm down? Shh.

362
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,154
…the Godfather, Rujul,
whoever the fuck, until I get it. Whatev...

363
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:45,762
- Fuck.
- Gentlemen.

364
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:50,851
Dirty Harry, Lin.
I've seen it now on VCR.

365
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:54,938
It's not a Western,
but very good all the same.

366
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:58,317
"Did I fire six shots, or only five?"

367
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,487
- It's very cool.
- Uh, bonne chance, Lin. Okay?

368
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:04,072
Wish you good luck.

369
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:10,871
For a Few Dollars More
is my favorite, yaar.

370
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:12,706
And then maybe Josey Wales.

371
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:15,629
Actually, no, the... the whole
Dollars trilogy would be my one-two-three.

372
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:19,713
And then maybe Josey Wales is my fourth,
because... just the way he puts it all...

373
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:26,011
You and me need to have a word.

374
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:30,807
This guy is crazy. Look at him.

375
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:32,309
Let me get rid of him. Apologies.

376
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:34,186
I'm going nowhere, mate.

377
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:36,438
I just got the shit kicked out of me.

378
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:39,066
After I went and helped Karla
get Lisa out of the Palace.

379
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:41,860
What? What happened to Lisa?

380
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:43,654
Oh, you didn't know?

381
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:46,532
Zhou was holding her prisoner.
She's a fucking mess.

382
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,577
Sorry. You need to leave.

383
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:51,662
Thank you.

384
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:53,413
No, no, no, no.

385
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:55,617
Where are you going?
It's a joke. Where are you going?

386
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:04,466
You know, I think you should
stop interfering with my business.

387
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:07,344
Lin, is Lisa all right? Where is she now?

388
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:09,221
What, you think I'd tell you arseholes?

389
00:32:10,806 --> 00:32:14,351
Zhou's people took my money
and my passport.

390
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:18,647
- The way I see it, all of that is on you.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

391
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:21,650
If you went to play hero
for a junkie whore,

392
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:23,026
that is Lisa's problem.

393
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:27,948
And if you did it to please Karla…
Tsk, tsk, tsk. That is her problem.

394
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:30,993
But you and I, we have no relationship.

395
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,744
I owe you nothing.

396
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:35,330
Oh, I think you're wrong about that.

397
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:39,918
- Don't fucking walk away from me.
- Arre, chaps.

398
00:32:40,002 --> 00:32:42,730
- It's okay. No, it's okay.
- This is not the place. Please, sit down.

399
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:43,755
Both of you, sit.

400
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,215
- After you. Oh!
- Have a seat.

401
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:53,724
Who the fuck do you think you are, hmm?

402
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:56,810
Aw, you turn up here,
you think you matter?

403
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:02,816
You know, only a fool plays a game
without knowing the rules first,

404
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:05,777
or the other players.

405
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:09,406
Let's go, Modena.

406
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:15,829
I wanted to smash
his pretty smiling face in.

407
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:20,042
Because I knew I could
and because it would feel great.

408
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:22,085
But mainly 'cause I knew he was right.

409
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:36,808
Prabhu.

410
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:41,104
Look, after this morning,

411
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,315
I wouldn't blame you
if you tell me to piss off,

412
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:46,610
but I need to make a phone call,
and I've got no money.

413
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:51,198
Yeah?

414
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:53,700
All right. Thank you.

415
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:08,590
Can I make an international call?

416
00:34:08,674 --> 00:34:09,675
Of course, Linbaba.

417
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:11,844
For three rupees you can call
anywhere in the world.

418
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:15,597
But one thing. I thought you had
no one to be calling for help.

419
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:17,139
There's one person who owes me.

420
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:18,851
ISD.

421
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:23,146
- Thank you.
- Dial.

422
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:38,120
It's okay?

423
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:45,878
- Yeah?
- Hey. It's me.

424
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,132
Charlie, you there? It's Dale.

425
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:55,679
You shouldn't be calling me.
There's no contact, we said.

426
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,515
I know. I know, mate.

427
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:01,643
Look, I need you to send me
some money to Bombay.

428
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:04,813
Dale, you got what you were owed.

429
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:07,649
You can't just call and expect
to keep sucking on the tit, mate.

430
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,778
I'm in serious trouble, Charlie.

431
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:13,780
Well, it's a bit of a habit with you, eh?

432
00:35:13,864 --> 00:35:15,741
Always got your dick in a vice.

433
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:18,368
This one's nothing to do with me.

434
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:21,872
Yes, it is, because my whole life
is fucked because of you.

435
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:27,002
Come on, Charlie.
Just help me out, please.

436
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,672
- You owe me.
- Not anymore, I don't.

437
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:32,799
Yes, you do. You fucking owe me.

438
00:35:33,759 --> 00:35:36,803
You'd be rotting in a fucking prison cell
if it wasn't for me.

439
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:40,432
Charlie.

440
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:46,021
Fuck! F...

441
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:49,358
Lin.

442
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:00,410
Lin!

443
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:04,540
Lin!

444
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:13,799
- Lin, wait!
- What? What? Why?

445
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:16,051
Why you trying to help me?

446
00:36:16,718 --> 00:36:18,887
I barely know you.
You know nothing about me.

447
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:21,390
Because you're my mate.

448
00:36:21,473 --> 00:36:23,267
Ah, yeah, mates. Mates.

449
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,435
Mates just fuck you over. Trust me.

450
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:30,023
- Lin.
- What?

451
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:32,943
Listen. Here, we have nothing.

452
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:38,407
This place is not working
without everyone helping each other.

453
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,743
Like I want to help you, Lin.

454
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:52,671
Okay?

455
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:06,310
I've been a total prick to you all day.

456
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:07,978
Yes.

457
00:37:08,061 --> 00:37:11,690
I can tell you're having
a not-so-good time.

458
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:13,483
Hmm?

459
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,569
Also not fully understanding
your situation.

460
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:18,739
But now, I think you are understanding.

461
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:20,824
- What? That I'm totally fucked?
- Yes.

462
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:25,162
And so now you're understanding
we can start getting you…

463
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:27,664
"unfuck."

464
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:29,458
- "Unfucked."
- Yes, "unfuck."

465
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,544
With us both working together,

466
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:37,382
we will make good money fatafat, Linbaba.

467
00:37:44,223 --> 00:37:48,060
All right.
Then I guess we better get started.

468
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:52,231
Chalo. Chalo, boss.

469
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:55,484
What kind of man is this Lin,
do you think?

470
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:58,820
I don't know. But Karla asked him for help
and he gave it.

471
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:01,156
I got a call from Reynaldo's.

472
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,033
He was there, making a scene.

473
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:07,746
He knows more than he should
and talks more than I like.

474
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:16,380
- Ah.
- Ah. Assalamu alaikum.

475
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:20,384
Alaikumu assalam.
Thank you for coming, Minister.

476
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:22,302
Of course. You call, I come.

477
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:27,391
You have been, uh,
doing your homework, I see.

478
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:29,518
Ah, knowledge is power, Rujul.

479
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:34,064
Hmm, only if you combine
with money and influence.

480
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:36,400
Or, in my case,
a very fine government position.

481
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:41,905
These people in Sagar Wada all know
they are fucked.

482
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:45,492
But, uh,
there's no power in that for them.

483
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:48,662
When was the last time you went
to one of the jhopadpattis?

484
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:50,581
To see the people there.

485
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:54,918
When I first came to Bombay,
I spent time in one of them.

486
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:56,670
It's long gone now,

487
00:38:56,753 --> 00:39:01,675
but what I saw then, and still see now,
is they do not believe themselves fucked.

488
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:06,096
They do not have the brains
nor the education to foster ambition.

489
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:10,392
- Ambitious men are never content.
- Men like us?

490
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:13,353
Yes, my friend. Men like us.

491
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,315
You're not in the slum any longer.

492
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:19,401
No, but I never forgot
the lessons I learned there.

493
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:22,863
Loyalty is everything.

494
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:28,076
I wonder what Walid learned
at Zhou's palace.

495
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:33,207
I know you plan to betray me

496
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:37,169
and sell Sagar Wada to Walid Shah.

497
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:40,339
Have I wronged you in any way?

498
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:42,716
Uh, Khaderbhai...

499
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:45,177
I financed your entire political career.

500
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:47,471
We have been friends.

501
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,389
So tell me…

502
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:53,101
how have I wronged you?

503
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:02,277
You have fallen behind.

504
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:09,409
Your insistence in staying
out of the brown sugar and sex trade

505
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:13,121
means you cannot compete
with Walid's price for Sagar Wada.

506
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:17,459
So, I did not wrong you?

507
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:21,046
I am supposed to make less money

508
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:23,841
because of your absurd code of morality?

509
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:27,719
Well, you could have come to me.
I would've listened.

510
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,348
And done nothing.

511
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,935
You have become weak, Khader.

512
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:00,794
Lisa.

513
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:05,132
Lisa, it's Sebastian.

514
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,933
What are you doing here?

515
00:41:15,017 --> 00:41:19,271
I, uh… I wanted to see if you're okay,
if you needed something.

516
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:20,814
How did you know I was here?

517
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:24,818
Uh, Lin.
He came after Maurizio at Reynaldo's.

518
00:41:24,902 --> 00:41:26,820
He's... He's dangerous, that one, I think.

519
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:28,322
Lin's the one who got me out.

520
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:31,992
Guy barely knows my name,
and he risked his life for me.

521
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:44,129
Does Maurizio know you're here?

522
00:41:45,255 --> 00:41:46,798
- No.
- Did he send you?

523
00:41:46,882 --> 00:41:49,551
No. Li...

524
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:54,348
Lisa, I... I shouldn't have let Maurizio
make you go to such a place.

525
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:57,476
I should've told him.
I'm... I'm sorry, Lisa.

526
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:00,979
I can see how you look at me now.

527
00:42:01,063 --> 00:42:02,231
And I deserve it.

528
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:04,983
It's not your fault you're weak.

529
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:16,411
I… love you.

530
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:21,041
Yeah. But you can't look after me.

531
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:25,087
I, um…

532
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:28,632
I thought you might need some.

533
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:31,552
Did you?

534
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:35,764
Or did Maurizio tell you to shoot me up
so I fall right back into line?

535
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:39,142
No. Lisa, Maurizio doesn't know
I'm here, I promise. I…

536
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:41,854
I just want you to be happy. That's all.

537
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:44,982
Him and me?
You're gonna have to choose, Modena.

538
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:48,110
You. You, Lisa.
I'd always choose you. Always.

539
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,698
Do you want this? I... I can…

540
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:54,741
No. I wanna quit.

541
00:42:55,534 --> 00:42:58,161
You say you love me,
then help me with that.

542
00:42:59,204 --> 00:43:01,498
Lisa. Just tell me how.

543
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:20,559
This is Prabhu.

544
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:22,282
From personal experience, I can tell you,

545
00:43:22,352 --> 00:43:24,646
anything you want,
he can get you at the best prices.

546
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:28,609
This is Dieter, Sarah, and Francois.
Right?

547
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:30,903
- Yeah.
- Keen to buy some top-quality charas.

548
00:43:30,986 --> 00:43:33,488
Mmm. Very pleased to meet you.

549
00:43:34,156 --> 00:43:36,575
- How much charas you are wanting?
- We want a pound.

550
00:43:39,328 --> 00:43:40,621
This is a lot of smoking.

551
00:43:41,496 --> 00:43:42,581
Can you do it?

552
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,459
Arre, of course, this is no problem.

553
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:47,711
You can go drink your beers,
enjoy the good music.

554
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:49,505
- I'll bring it, okay?
- Sounds good.

555
00:43:49,588 --> 00:43:51,840
- All right. I'll be in in a minute.
- Thank you.

556
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:55,260
I told you, Linbaba. Good business.

557
00:43:55,344 --> 00:43:56,637
Big money for this.

558
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:02,518
Wait.

559
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:07,814
What? You wanna see the sights?
Buy some charas?

560
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:11,985
There's a thousand dollars in here
for your trouble,

561
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:14,780
and a name and an address in Ahmedabad.

562
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:16,990
They'll be expecting you.

563
00:44:17,074 --> 00:44:19,117
They'll make you a new passport
at my expense.

564
00:44:19,868 --> 00:44:21,328
That's what you need, isn't it?

565
00:44:22,287 --> 00:44:23,956
What changed since this morning?

566
00:44:27,668 --> 00:44:30,003
Oh, you really need me to keep quiet, eh?

567
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:34,216
Whatever you're looking for, Lin,
it's not here. Not anymore.

568
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:36,510
I thought maybe you were it.

569
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:39,888
Now you know different.

570
00:45:06,957 --> 00:45:08,458
Your half of charas deal.

571
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:11,545
No, you keep it. I got what I need.

572
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:16,258
Look, I understand
if you think I'm a prick,

573
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:20,095
but I would like a proper goodbye.

574
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,322
I will not be seeing you again, na?

575
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:40,616
No.

576
00:45:45,078 --> 00:45:46,997
You have a good heart, Linbaba.

577
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:55,649
- Did you tell Khader?
- Yes.

578
00:46:57,609 --> 00:46:59,236
Then we just got a man killed.

579
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:01,989
It doesn't bother you?

580
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:04,116
I made my choice.

581
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:08,120
I found the heroin you left behind.

582
00:47:09,663 --> 00:47:11,456
You wanted to see what choice I'd make?

583
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:13,667
And?

584
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,002
Lin talked me out of it.

585
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:17,087
I made him throw it away.

586
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:20,632
I wanna change.

587
00:47:24,428 --> 00:47:26,138
He could've been good for you.

588
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:32,227
I gave him a way out of Bombay tonight.

589
00:47:33,645 --> 00:47:35,397
It's the best thing I could give him.

590
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,191
Take a life, save a life?

591
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:40,027
Does that make it all okay?

592
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:59,296
We danced together all the time, once.
Do you remember?

593
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:01,340
I remember.

594
00:48:06,553 --> 00:48:07,804
I was in love with you.

595
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:12,392
Wanted to be everything you seemed to be.

596
00:48:14,186 --> 00:48:15,437
But, then, you know that.

597
00:48:31,578 --> 00:48:32,746
Fuck me.

598
00:48:34,164 --> 00:48:35,874
I'm leaving. All right?

599
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:39,419
You tell that mad cow Zhou I'm on my way.

600
00:48:39,503 --> 00:48:42,089
I'm leaving Bombay.
There's no need for any of this.

601
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:44,007
Fuck you!

602
00:48:50,389 --> 00:48:51,431
Fuck.

603
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:10,260
I was trying to learn my lesson for once.

604
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:13,931
Be smart and do what I needed to survive.

605
00:50:14,556 --> 00:50:15,766
To be free.
