1
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,697
Yaar, Prabhu,
do you realize what time it is?

2
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,284
I don't want any more fucking goras
this late.

3
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,915
Take them, please.

4
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,627
-I'll do it because it's you.
-Then do it.

5
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,883
This man says he is a hotel guest?

6
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,093
Who?

7
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,887
This man says he is a hotel guest.
Is this true?

8
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:00,764
Yes, he is a guest.

9
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:01,932
What is his name?

10
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,600
-Just a second. It's in the register.
-Let me see.

11
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,228
-I'll show you, sir.
-Give it to me.

12
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,773
Show me his C-Form.

13
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,025
C-Form, it would be over here.

14
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:21,076
The bastard has been fighting
and does not want the hospital.

15
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,079
-Oh, yeah?
-Come on. Why does it take so long?

16
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,722
Show me his room. Now.

17
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,233
-Hurry up!
-Yes, sir.

18
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,403
This is the room.

19
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,546
How are you doing, Arun? Johnny?

20
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,011
-I'll help them.
-You won't. I'll go.

21
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:53,680
Go clean the table.

22
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,808
Do you want something?

23
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:59,228
Chai and roti for us both, please.

24
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,669
Who's the gora?

25
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,257
-He is my new business partner.
-Business partner?

26
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:31,385
We are going to be working together
in the tourist business.

27
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,472
Parvati?

28
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:36,723
I'm coming!

29
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:30,807
This guy is crazy. Look at him.

30
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:32,309
Let me get rid of him. Apologies.

31
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,577
Sorry. You need to leave.

32
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:51,662
Thank you.

33
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:55,415
Where are you going?
It's a joke. Where are you going?

34
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:09,406
Let's go, Modena.
