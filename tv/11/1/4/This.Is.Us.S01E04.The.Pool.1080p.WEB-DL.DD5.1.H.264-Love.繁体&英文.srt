一天晚上  我在回酒店的路上
and one night, I was walking back to my hotel,

709
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:00,580
然后遇了一人
and... I came across this man...

710
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,300
一旅客
a traveler.

711
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,500
他穿得破破的
He was wearing ragged clothes

712
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,310
口音很奇怪
and he had a strange way of talking.

713
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:10,430
有三牡霸谄圬他
And these three young jerks were bothering him.

714
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,060
他想拿走他的一袋生活用品
They were trying to take away his bag of groceries.

715
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,230
所以我把那些牡摆s跑了
And so... I chased the jerks off.

716
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,180
你一人
By yourself?

717
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,270
是的  就我一人
Yeah, by myself.

718

It happened.

721
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,530
@旅客非常感激
And the traveler was so grateful,

722
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,930
想蟠鹞
he wanted to repay me.

723
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,830
但他有的|西不多
You know, he-he didn't have much,

724
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,970
所以他把手伸M他的小包里
so he reaches into his little satchel

725
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,810
掏出了@件衣服
and he pulls out this shirt.

726
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,340
他跟我f@是件有魔法的T恤
