1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,230
Previously on This Is Us...

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,240
I wanted to be the man that made you happy.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,930
From here on out, I'm gonna be a 12 for you.

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,230
You are getting in the car right now,

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,610
and we are going to this doctors appointment.

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,160
Hi, white people.

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,340
I don't know what you were looking for with all this,

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,840
but I do know you don't have a whole lot of time.

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,450
I'd like to tell the girls who you are.

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,710
I was not a very good brother to you, was I?

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,720
No, you weren't.

12
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,020
But you still got time.

13
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,880
- Toby. ?- Kate.

14
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,550
How's your breakfast?

15
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,710
You mean this, uh, steel-cut oatmeal and egg-white pancake

16
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,890
you're making me eat? It's amazing.

17
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,770
I'm gonna do theater.

18
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,730
I did it-- I-I-

19
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,220
I booked a redeye to New York.

20
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,360
It's a scorcher out there, folks.

21
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,020
- Stay cool, Pittsburgh. - ?Shut up.

22
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,100
Don't tell me to shut up.

23
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,730
- You're doing it wrong. - No, I'm not.

24
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,490
- Yes, you are. - Mom, I'm hot.

25
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,790
I know, kiddo. Dad is trying to fix the air conditioning.

26
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,320
Babe, how's it going? We're dying in here.

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,470
I'm working on it.

28
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,290
Give it back!

29
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,840
- Just hold on. ?- Enough!

30
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,650
Mom, Randall took my Rubik's Cube.

31
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,880
- You weren't doing it right. - Enough. Come here.

32
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,370
You did this?

33
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,420
You're supposed to be yelling at him!

34
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,740
Randall, stop scratching.

35
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,440
That's a rash, babe. You're gonna make it worse.

36
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,130
Okay, I think I have a solution.

37
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,870
Is it fixed? Jack, what...

38
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,420
What are you doing wearing that shirt? You know I hate that shirt.

39
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,850
I'm wearing this shirt because it makes me think of fun.

41
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,510
It makes me think of sun.

42
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,840
And because we are going to the pool!

43
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,440
Kate Pearson, you get in here

44
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,530
and you strut your stuff, young lady.

45
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,560
That's right.

46
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,400
- Care Bears. ?- You know it, you know it.

47
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,130
Today, people, we are gonna debut

48
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,920
the brand-new Care Bear bikini!

49
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,590
Can we go to the Greenview pool?

50
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,760
The one with the diving board? Please.

51
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,250
No, that place sucks.

52
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,420
You barely get in anyway. ?

53
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,090
The Big Three. Your brother needs you.

54
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,590
Come on, you big mope.

55
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,770
Don't hold out on us.

56
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,480
Please. Please.

57
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,720
Okay, okay, yes.

58
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,980
- Go get your swimsuits on. - Go get your suits.

59
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,630
Come on, towels, towels.

60
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,140
AC is zonked, babe, we're gonna have to call someone.

61
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,010
Pool, huh? Not a movie?

62
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,180
Are you sure you're okay with the pool today.

63
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,320
We're gonna have a day-long pool vacation.

64
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,600
I'm gonna snag us

65
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,200
not one, not two,

66
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,940
- but five pool chairs. - Five?

67
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,830
I'm gonna snag us five pool chairs.

68
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,050
- You bad man. - ?Yes, I am.

69
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,430
The kids are gonna run off,

70
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,890
you're gonna finish that book you've been

72
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,380
Oh, it's gonna be fun.

73
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,020
No, no, no,

74
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,240
the book is Misery, by Stephen King.

75
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,470
Oh, yeah, right.

76
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,280
Hey, I already packed the cooler.

77
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,160
All soft drinks, no beer.

78
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,180
A whole day at the pool with those kids and no beer?

79
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,130
I told you, I stopped drinking.

80
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,120
It's not you I'm worried about.

81
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,970
See? That's what we need, then.

82
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,760
We just need a day to relax.

83
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,910
A reminder, there is no running,

84
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,400
no diving, and absolutely no glass containers in the pool area.

85
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,560
Feeling relaxed yet?

86
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,570
There's a chair!

87
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,530
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

88
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,380
Go get it! Get it, yes!

89
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,390
Get it, get it, get it. ?Yeah!

90
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,080
Oh, stop it. That doesn't hurt.

91
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,580
Oh, that one might've hurt.

92
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,230
Sorry. Gotcha.

93
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,050
I want Grandpa to do mine.

94
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,250
No problem, Miss Annie.

95
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,310
Oh, really? You want Grandpa to try to tame this mess?

96
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,050
- Have at it. - Let's see here.

97
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,660
Oh, that's gotta go. Beth, where's your scissors?

98
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,970
No! ?

99
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,740
Then you better sit still and not give me a hard time.

100
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,540
How'd you get that scar?

101
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, that? Rock, bottle...

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,730
there were plenty in the air that day.

103
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,110
Maybe we don't tell that story.

104
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,550
Oh, no, it's not a bad one.

106
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,880
and I was helping out with that.

107
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,550
'86, '87?

108
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,630
What's bussing?

109
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,130
Getting poor children into the schools

110
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,380
in better neighborhoods.

111
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,770
You were working with the Urban League?

112
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,070
Yeah, a little bit, yeah.

113
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,210
Look, I gotta get on my walk.

114
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,910
You wanna take over here?

115
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,230
Okay, you two, let's get moving.

116
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,490
Mom and I gotta get to work

117
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,160
so we can pay for all this hair product.

118
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,720
- The Eagle has landed. - What's up?

119
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,580
I'm officially a New Yorker now-- East Coast!

120
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,510
Hey, somebody wants to say hi.

121
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,880
Uncle Kevin, come see my play.

122
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,950
I'm Snow White.

123
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,170
You're kidding me!

124
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,440
Snow White's my favorite character of all time!

125
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,250
I'm actually auditioning for a play, too.

126
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,940
Yeah, it's very dark, very, very truthful--

127
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,340
- Do the Manny voice. - What's that?

128
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,280
They love it when you do the catchphrase.

129
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,040
I don't want to do the Manny voice.

130
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,970
- Please. ?- Please.

131
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,380
- Baby say what? - ?Like, for real.

132
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,860
Baby say what?

133
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,260
No, like in the show.

134
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,570
Baby say what?

135
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,120
Your biggest fans.

136
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,070
Any... Anyway, this play is a total departure for me,

137
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,610
you know?

138
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,240
None of that, like, Manny stuff.

139
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,420
It's a character-driven departure for me.

140
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,270
Where'd you go? What are you looking at?

141
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,100
Hey, man, uh, I gotta go.

142
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,320
You're just gonna hang up on him?

143
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,640
No, no, no, I will not show you my I.D.

144
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,390
Not until you tell me why you need a reason to see it.

145
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,320
Tony, what's going on here?

146
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,340
Hey, Mr. Pearson. We had a report of someone loitering.

147
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,630
I wasn't loitering.

148
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,730
I was taking my walk, and literally

149
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,390
on my way to smell the roses,

150
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,380
- as I have been for the past week. - ?I know.

151
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,270
Is there some local rose smelling ordinance

152
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,740
- I'm not aware of? - ?William, enough.

153
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,680
Enough...

154
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,310
He's with you, sir?

155
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,060
Yeah, he's staying with us.

156
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,570
- Sorry. ?- Sorry?

157
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,870
We're so sorry.

158
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,660
We didn't know, Randall.

159
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,010
Understood. Thanks.

160
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,340
Thank you, Tony.

161
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,480
We're gonna get you some new clothes.

162
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,890
I hate kale.

163
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,970
Me, too.

164
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,290
Baby arugula is just as bad as grown-up arugula.

165
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,310
All right, you know what?

166
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,180
Here we go.

167
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,910
Oh, no, no, no. Let me get--

168
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,060
Remember, you are unemployed.

169
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,500
And I am not convinced that you would do well

170
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,570
- begging for money. - Are you kidding?

171
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,010
You don't think the drivers will be sympathetic to me

172
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,680
holding up a sign that says "Hungry?"

173
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,130
That's good.

174
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,430
I'm gonna use the restroom, and then we'll go, okay?

175
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:35,890
How are you?

176
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,740
- Uh, good. How are you? - ?Good.

177
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,210
Okay, uh... you wanna get out of here?

178
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,910
- Who was that? ?- Who was...

179
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,200
You saw that. Uh, that was my ex-wife.

180
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,590
Wait, are you serious?

181
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,720
Yeah. I told you I was married before.

182
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,300
Not to that.

184
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,750
Supermodel, pose... and catwalk.

185
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,110
Hey, Kate, stop being silly.

186
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,370
Come over here, please.

187
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,700
Samantha and Vicki are here!

188
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,250
- Care Bears! - Okay, that's two.

189
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,720
Babe, I had to sleep with someone to get this one.

190
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,220
- I hope that's okay. - Yeah, I'm fine with it.

191
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,920
As long as his wife is okay with it.

192
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,870
Kevin, you're up, please. Shirt off.

193
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,620
Why? I don't even like swimming.

194
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,940
You don't have to put your face in.

195
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,370
You can sit in the shallow end and Randall will stay with you.

196
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,640
I don't like Randall either.

197
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,830
- Hey, Kev, come on. - Enough.

198
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,750
Turn around.

199
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,210
Randall, you're up, please.

200
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,600
Come here.

201
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
Turn around, please.

202
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,950
Are you sure I really need sunscreen?

203
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,650
- Yes, absolutely. ?- Yeah, absolutely.

204
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,320
Of course you do. Sure.

205
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,350
Okay, look, Big Three, come here.

206
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,280
Come here. You are surrounded by adults

207
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,520
and lifeguards that resemble adults.

208
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,230
There's very little trouble you can actually get into--

209
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,930
Wait, wait. Kate, baby,

210
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,030
are you sure you don't want to put a shirt on?

211
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,630
- Right. - ?Here.

212
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,050
Enjoy your Misery.

213
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,580
People are staring at her in that bathing suit, Jack.

214
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,850
Some jerky little kid is gonna say something.

215
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,000
It's baby fat.

216
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,950
She's only eight years old. Kids haven't turned mean yet.

217
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,010
And what is up with Kevin lately, and that attitude?

218
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,860
- He's so jealous of Randall. - He's fine.

219
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,090
Babe, he's fine. They are all fine.

220
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,420
And does Randall need sunscreen?

221
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,170
I mean, have we just been wasting sunscreen all of these years?

222
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,100
That I have no answer for.

223
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,210
Chair. Chair!

224
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,480
Careful!

225
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,710
She's his ex-wife, Kate.

226
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,310
All right? The operative word being "Ex."

227
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,150
They're not together anymore. He's with you now.

228
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,760
"Why?" is the question. You should see her.

230
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,310
Maybe that's what Toby wants.

231
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,320
Maybe he's fulfilling a fat-girl fetish with me.

232
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,860
Well, that's actually a thing.

233
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,430
Of course, for me it was

234
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,040
more of a phase than a thing, but anyway...

235
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,930
I did a deep dive with this woman.

236
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,370
Everything reeks fabulous.

237
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,480
She has fabulous taste, she has fabulous friends.

238
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,210
She's been to Argentina, Kevin!

239
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,910
Listen to me, I did not leave you in Los Angeles

240
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,610
so you could self-sabotage, okay?

241
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,590
So get off the Internet-- do that right now--

242
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,070
and tell me how hard I'm gonna crush this audition.

243
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,760
The edges are gone...

244
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,130
and then the thing.

245
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,080
Thank you, Sean Patrick.

246
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,270
Some good choices, I thought.

247
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,460
It's Daniel. Everyone else sucks.

248
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,740
You know, I kind of liked--

249
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,920
It's Daniel.

250
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,120
Hold on, hold on.

251
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,380
We have one more. Kevin Pearson.

252
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,780
Sorry. I know, I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late.

253
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,890
It's just, you know, I tried to take the subway, right,

254
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,510
and then walk, like a New Yorker.

255
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,040
Ron Shiller.

256
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,470
This is Sloane Sandberg.

257
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,210
- You're the, uh, screenwriter. - Playwright.

258
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,950
Well, you know, I mean, you gotta start somewhere.

259
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,920
You'll be reading with Miss Maine today, if that's okay.

260
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,360
Yeah, no, whatever you got, you know.

261
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,370
Miss Maine, Miss Iowa.

262
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,220
I judged, uh, Miss USA for Trump once,

263
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,330
so we may have actually met before.

264
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,120
Miss Maine is Olivia Maine.

265
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,660
Tony nominee.

266
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,690
She plays Jessica.

267
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,960
Of course. Hi. Good to meet you.

268
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,820
Well, before we start, I just wanted to...

269
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,330
I want to get something off my chest.

270
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,910
I do understand the perception, you know.

271
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,400
These L.A. actors, they come out here, right?

272
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,740
They do their little quick stint in theater

273
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,340
just to feel better about themselves.

274
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,800
That's not why I'm here, okay?

275
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,020
I'm here for the right reasons.

276
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,290
Let's get this over with, shall we?

277
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,760
Did you want me to start?

278
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,560
Yes, I thought it would be good, if,

279
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,950
you speak, then I speak,

280
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,670
then you speak, and we all go home.

281
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,700
Does that work for you?

282
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,070
Yeah. That's great...

283
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,570
My recollection's hazy, actually, it was a long day.

284
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,780
Not for me. Mine was over before 9:00 in the morning.

285
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,310
That's really good... accent.

286
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,750
- What? - ?The American accent.

287
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,180
What?

288
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,070
I just... diving... diving right back in.

289
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,480
It say, uh... it says "I lay," uh, I don't...

290
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,420
Let me just say... I don't need to say it. It says...

291
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,420
I'll just say it.

292
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,760
I lay...

293
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,990
Just keep going.

294
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,420
This is...

295
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,590
I'll get it.

296
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,690
I lay on the dock all night,

297
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,040
and part of the next morning.

298
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,090
And I don't feel a thing.

299
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,000
Let me take that again.

300
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,620
Oh, my gosh... Oh, my gosh.

301
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,020
Okay. Baby say what...

302
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,830
Okay. I-I lay... Let me get into it.

303
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,250
I lay on the dock all night and part of the next morning.

304
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,450
And I don't feel a thing.

305
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,710
The bug bites, the sunburn. Nothin'.

306
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,980
It's like when we used to go fishing. You remember?

307
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,280
- I never fished... - Do you have the next...

308
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,560
- What the hell? - ?Sorry.

309
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,880
You weren't talking, so I thought...

310
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,280
It's called a pause.

311
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,170
Right.

312
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,020
Sorry. It doesn't say pause on my script...

313
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,870
Well, it doesn't say suck, either, yet here we are.

314
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,070
You know your size?

315
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,220
Always tended toward the slim.

316
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,610
I don't see that changing much at this point.

317
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,690
Try these.

318
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,610
Afterwards, we'll swing by the pharmacy,

319
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,090
get those medications that the doctor wrote for you.

320
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,430
Sounds like a plan.

321
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,520
$100?

322
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,020
It's what they cost.

323
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,710
I'm paying, just take the pants.

324
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,060
So are we gonna talk about it or not?

325
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,400
Talk about what?

326
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,040
About what. Uh, this morning.

327
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,790
Or are you content to stand in silent judgment with that face?

328
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,290
It's just my face.

329
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,800
No, you didn't like me apologizing for you.

330
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,430
I get it.

331
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,600
Would you have been happier if I made a big scene?

332
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,440
You know, got up in Tony's face,

333
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,010
had the cops roll up and turn the hoses on us?

334
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,560
It's the Cosgroves.

335
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,950
He runs an insurance agency, she collects owls.

336
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,300
History would not have memorialized our stand.

337
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,850
You ever had a hose turned on you?

338
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,380
Can't say that I have, I'm very sorry.

339
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,810
Don't be. It hurts.

340
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,080
And there's that face.

341
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,470
Only face I got. Look, I could use some socks...

342
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,570
No, the face. The one that says I have a scar

343
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,890
on my arm from integrating schools.

344
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,790
And probably blisters on your feet from marching for freedom,

345
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,410
but me, because I grew up in a white house,

346
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,990
you think I don't live in a black man's world.

347
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,990
Oh, you know the one.

348
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,590
The one where that salesman there has been eyeballing us

349
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,970
ever since we came in here.

350
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,680
Or where that security guard has moved just a little

351
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,890
off his mark so he can keep us in his sight.

352
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,120
And where they'll definitely ask

353
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,600
for an ID with my credit card when I go to pay,

354
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,980
even though they haven't asked for anybody else's.

355
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,810
Plus a million things every day

356
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,750
that I have to choose to let go,

357
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,180
just so I'm not pissed off all the time.

358
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,690
Like I did on the street this morning.

359
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,620
Like I have done every day of my life.

360
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,850
Now try on the damn slim cut flat front chinos.

361
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,690
I think they'll look nice on you.

362
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,670
Randall

363
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,740
Watch!

364
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,410
Cool! Cool!

365
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,990
Dad, watch! Dad!

366
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,200
- Where's the other one? - I'm looking.

367
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,420
Man, you take your eyes off one for a second,

368
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,550
you lose track of the others.

369
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,060
That's because there are more of them

370
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,250
than there are of us.

371
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,580
Always will be.

372
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,040
What? Oh.

373
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,030
Talking about the kids.

374
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,710
Yep. It's a war. They got the numbers.

375
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,360
- Dad! Dad! - We were beat before we started.

376
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,890
- Watch! - There she is.

377
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,340
Hi. Hey, guys.

378
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,620
You want to play mermaids?

379
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,530
This is from all of us.

380
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,410
Dad!

381
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,970
Dad! Daddy! Dad!

382
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,090
Dad, watch me!

383
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,360
Yeah. I see you, pal!

384
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,320
Do you remember the first time he said "Dad"?

385
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,400
How happy I was?

386
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,520
Now where's Randall?

387
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,180
How about that time? Did you see?

388
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,970
Hey, Kev. Where's your brother?

389
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,950
I don't know!

390
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,310
Jack.

391
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,620
You take land, I'll take sea.

392
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,280
Dad! Watch!

393
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,130
Kevin.

394
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,330
You were supposed to watch each other!

395
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,510
Randall!

396
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,460
Randall!

397
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,900
Kate, it was the worst audition

398
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,770
in the history of the world. Okay?

399
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,840
I mean, that woman made me so nervous,

400
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,120
I started doing an English accent

401
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,680
in the middle of it for no reason!

402
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,490
Okay, I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

403
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,480
Maybe that's the problem. You know?

404
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,670
- I wanted it too much. - Hey! It's the Man-ny!

405
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,450
Hey Man-ny! How's it going?

406
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,380
Yeah. Listen. Could you please fly out here?

407
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,710
I really need you right now.

408
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,580
You'll be fine, you just...

409
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,560
What? I'm just what? Where'd you go?

411
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,170
Nowhere. I'm here. I'm shopping.

412
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,910
- I'm lost. - You're not lost.

413
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,800
It's just all new. It's just new.

414
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,150
No... I mean I'm actually lost,

415
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,360
I have no idea where the hell I'm at. I got to go.

416
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,680
Sorry. Oh.

417
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,030
That whole thing back there, just so you know.

418
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,630
I'm not actually bad, okay?

419
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,020
- Okay. Duly noted. - Okay.

420
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,550
Okay. Just wanted to get that out there.

421
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,840
Well, out there it is.

422
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,180
Although you weren't super helpful.

423
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,380
You want to get a drink?

424
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,430
What, like, now?

425
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,100
Yeah. Now. Come on,

426
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,800
- L.A. - Yeah.

429
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,290
Mom, the play's about to start!

430
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,500
All right, Tess. Hurry up.

431
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,730
Go get your dress on. Get her shoes.

432
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,640
- Hurry, hurry, hurry. - Break a leg.

433
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,500
Come on...

434
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,050
This is a nice place.

435
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,730
Yeah. Public schools in this area are good,

436
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,870
It's why we moved here.

437
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,650
Even better than private.

438
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,110
You know, the parents are real involved.

439
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,780
You know, Beth's on the board.

440
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,770
Real involved.

441
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,890
They got a farm.

442
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,390
- Really? - Yeah, out back.

443
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,490
Kids learn about the land. Grow their own food.

444
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,780
Thank you.

445
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,590
They got, uh, chickens.

446
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,390
They got a goat.

447
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,250
Can I help you find something?

448
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,640
No.

449
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,610
You're here about the job.

450
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,760
You know. The job?

451
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,230
Y-Yeah.

452
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,060
Great!

453
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,030
Let's go over here so we can talk.

454
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,050
Randall!

455
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,300
Randall!

456
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,040
Kate, have you seen Randall?

457
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,530
Randall!

459
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,660
Randall?

460
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,350
Randall...

461
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,900
Randall! Hello!

462
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,160
Did you not hear me calling you?

463
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,130
- Hey, what are you doing over here? - Oh, no, no, no...

464
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,040
- I've been... - It's okay. I'm watching him.

465
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,060
Okay, it's... I-I have him now. I'm sorry,

466
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,340
I'm his mother. I was a little panicked. I'm Rebecca.

467
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,570
We know who you are.

468
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,090
You do?

469
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,280
Oh yes. When a white family has a black child

470
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,790
and they don't introduce themselves to any of us,

471
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,650
we tend to take notice.

472
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,870
Well. Thank you for watching him.

473
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,890
He's just not supposed to be over here.

474
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,840
Not "over here" like that.

475
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,620
There's nothing wrong with over here.

476
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,470
I just mean that I want him where we can see him,

477
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,190
where we're sitting, in front of us.

478
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,950
Thank you. It was very nice to meet you.

479
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,120
Randall, come on. Let's go.

480
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,930
Come on. Thank you.

481
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,090
Actually, you stay right here.

482
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,220
That's my son, and I'm his mother.

483
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,080
And I don't know if you have

484
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,480
some sort of problem with that arrangement,

485
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,840
but also, I don't really care.

486
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,100
Thank you very much for watching my son.

487
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,170
But I have him now.

488
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,330
- Okay. - Okay.

489
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,740
You need to get the child a proper haircut.

490
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,580
The razor bumps on his neck.

491
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,420
You need a barber who knows how to cut black hair.

492
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,580
Come on.

493
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,610
I told you to stay with your brother, didn't I?

494
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,550
Sorry.

495
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,740
Is this the real reason you wanted to come to this pool

496
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,730
and not the other?

497
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,220
Come on.

499
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,050
So beautiful.

500
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,180
Ho, there. Who might you be, fair maid?

501
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,330
I am the Princess Snow White.

502
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,840
I have traveled this land and many others,

503
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,670
and never have I seen a beauty so fair.

504
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,770
Where are you from, noble sir?

505
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,610
What errand brings you to the forest?

506
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,660
I come from a land far away.

507
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,180
- The, uh... - Thank you.

508
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,990
That play is really special, isn't it?

509
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,840
I mean, I don't read a lot of plays,

510
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,750
- but that's -- that's good. - Yeah. Yeah, I got that.

511
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,660
No, look, it's...

512
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,430
it's really good, actually.

513
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,640
I mean, it's... it's fragile.

514
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,950
It's -- it's delicate.

515
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,490
So, where are you from, Kevin Pearson?

516
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,420
Me?

517
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,400
Uh... Pittsburgh, originally.

518
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,850
You got family back there?

519
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,970
Um... not anymore.

520
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,800
Right, so, L.A. is home now?

521
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,790
Yeah, I guess so.

522
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,540
Yeah.

523
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,980
I think you should go back there.

524
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,040
I know, right?

525
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,280
Are you serious?

526
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,110
I am serious.

527
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,160
And I'm telling you this as a friend

528
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,080
because I see this all the time.

529
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,970
I mean, you said it yourself.

530
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,870
Pretty people come here from TV or movies

531
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,730
because they want to do something real.

532
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,830
I mean, even if they've...

533
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,490
they've never had a genuine moment in their entire lives.

534
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,730
Do you know what they find out?

535
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,320
That guess what?

536
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,100
It's hard.

537
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,900
It's so hard.

538
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,740
It's not...

539
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,770
it's not pretend,

541
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,080
it's not Guys and Dolls in some high school cafeteria.

542
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,160
It's not...

543
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,010
I'm sorry, what-what-what was the-the movie you were in?

544
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,320
It was a TV show, actually,

545
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,670
called, uh, The Man-ny.

546
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,660
Yeah, and look,

547
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,460
I'm not saying that

548
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,740
you're not good at what you do.

549
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,930
I'm sure you're...

550
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,100
you're great at it.

551
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,890
I mean, I-I couldn't do it.

552
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,380
But this... is not that.

553
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,640
You're in over your head,

554
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,410
Kevin Pearson.

555
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,730
I mean, if you really want to do this, then go home,

556
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,010
find a class, get some training.

557
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,080
I'm just being honest.

558
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,490
I see.

559
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,460
As a... as a friend.

560
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,690
- Yeah. - Yeah.

561
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,500
Still, just, you know, it feels like

562
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,180
you're using the word "Friend" wrong.

563
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,500
Everything all right?

564
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,760
- You okay? - Yeah.

565
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:14,660
Yeah?

566
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,380
Yeah.

567
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,960
You got the part.

568
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,000
Wait, I'm sorry, what?

569
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,130
They think the nanny will sell tickets.

570
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,130
It was actually The Man-ny.

571
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,810
Dad, look! I'm going under and everything!

572
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,400
Dad!

573
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,040
- Yeah, I see you, pal! - Randall.

574
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,040
- Dad! - Lunch, baby.

575
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,930
- Dad! - You know, maybe she was just

576
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,260
- trying to be helpful. - Dad! Watch!

577
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,390
By condescendingly telling me how I could raise my kid? Yeah.

578
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,880
- No, thank you. - Dad!

579
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,520
*I love my father and I love him well...*

580
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,730
*I hope to see him someday soon*

581
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,490
*I love my father and I love him well*

582
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,330
*I hope to see him someday soon*

583
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,510
*'Cause where I live  It gets dark at night*

584
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,230
*The kind of dark eats up the light*

585
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,220
*Yeah, where I live  It gets dark at night*

586
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,960
*The kind of dark eats up the light*

587
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,740
*And you know that, mother*

588
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,710
*I'd be lying*

589
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,690
*If I didn't tell you I'm afraid of night.*

590
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,550
Kate, you're not eating.

591
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,430
You okay?

592
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:53,820
What's up with her?

593
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,020
Are you kidding me?! Oh! Why?

594
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,060
Because we didn't make her wear a T-shirt, that's why.

595
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,220
No, no, Jack, you're only gonna make it worse.

596
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,060
Sit...

597
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,620
Sit down. Seriously.

598
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,060
I almost drowned!

599
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,510
- What? - Did you even care?

600
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,870
- When? - I tried to get to the deep end,

601
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,680
- but you never watch me. - Hey. Calm down.

602
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,040
- You always watch them. - Kev, Kev, Kev.

603
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,120
- Come on... - Don't touch me.

604
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,320
Watch yourself, pal.

605
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:22,420
And you're so busy making sure that Kate's not eating too much...

606
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,430
Kev, calm down.

607
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,420
and... and Randall's not too adopted,

608
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,690
and meanwhile, where's Kevin?

609
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,470
Oh, guess what?

610
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,830
He's dead.

611
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,850
Bud, we love you. We were watching...

612
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:32,640
Don't touch me.

613
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,620
I got this one.

614
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,370
Hey, come here. Come here.

615
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:37,950
- What? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

616
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,000
I'm sorry.

617
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,300
Okay? I should have been watching.

618
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,110
- Okay? - You should have.

619
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,450
And I said I was and I should have been watching you, pal.

620
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,320
I'm trying, okay?

621
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,800
Look, I know that I'm bigger than you.

622
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,000
I know that I'm an adult,

623
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,970
but I... th-th-this is my first time, okay?

624
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,450
This is my first time, too.

625
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,400
I got three of you and I'm trying.

626
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,240
I'm sorry. I should've been there.

627
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,300
And I'm gonna be there, okay?

628
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,180
Okay.

629
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,180
Can I have a hug?

630
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,550
Can I get a "Dad, I love you"?

631
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,180
Do you have the name of a barber?

632
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,610
I do.

633
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,570
Well, I would appreciate it.

634
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,680
Then I'll write it down.

635
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,480
When he gets out of the pool,

636
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,030
you need to put lotion on him

637
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,150
or he gets ashy.

638
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,270
Lotion. Okay.

639
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,480
Thank you.

640
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,730
Do you think that my son could play with yours

641
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,890
sometime after school?

642
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,900
Yeah, yeah.

643
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,110
I think we can do that.

644
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,890
And does he need sunscreen or not?

645
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,540
He does, right?

646
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,510
I thought he did.

647
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,670
I knew he did!

648
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,410
Can you tell my husband that, please?

649
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,820
Uh, I didn't bring a resume, sorry.

650
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,280
I didn't think I'd have a job interview.

651
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,060
And I thought I would just pick up an application...

652
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,620
Oh, well, you're here and I'm here, let's talk.

653
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,770
You have really pretty skin.

654
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,180
Oh, thank you.

655
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,720
So do you.

656
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,530
Thanks.

657
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,500
So, Kate, do you know anything about my store or my background?

658
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,030
Hmm... A little.

659
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,810
I know that you've had this store since 2013

660
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,410
and before that you sold your own designs on Etsy,

661
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,460
until you partnered with that woman

662
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,510
that you met at UC Santa Cruz--

664
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,050
at her wedding in Thailand.

665
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,810
Oh, so beautiful.

666
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,720
Like, that is my dream trip.

667
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,860
And then you imported those scarves

668
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,520
then it just, like, took off from there.

669
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,840
Oh, and you're divorced, you have no kids

670
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,930
and you look amazing in wide-brimmed hats.

671
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,500
I assume.

672
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,890
You just have the head for it.

673
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,470
I don't. I look like a pacifier.

674
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:19,120
I like a person who does her research before an interview.

675
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,590
I'm a big researcher.

676
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,610
Hey, what's up?

677
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,300
So, the good news is: I got a job.

678
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,970
Well, that means that there's bad news.

680
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,400
Adult swim.

681
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,110
Adult swim only.

682
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,570
You cold?

683
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,830
T-shirt?

684
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,290
I didn't bring one.

685
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,460
Well...

686
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,120
I brought a T-shirt.

687
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,550
That's the one Mommy hates.

688
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,020
Oh, Mommy's just jealous.

689
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,230
I don't think so.

690
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,070
Well, it's true.

691
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,630
She just pretends like she hates it

692
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,060
because I won't let her wear it.

693
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,630
You know where I got this shirt?

694
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,690
I heard Mommy say it was from a drugged-out drifter.

695
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,630
Listen, Mommy doesn't know the whole truth,

696
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,730
so this is gonna have to stay between us, okay?

697
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,960
I got it...

698
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,920
in Florida.

699
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,370
A magical land called Daytona Beach.

700
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,540
Can we go there?

701
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,680
No.

702
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,750
No, you may never go to Daytona Beach.

703
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,940
I want you to say it out loud:

704
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,890
"Daddy, I will never go to Daytona Beach."

705
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,300
Daddy, I will never go to Daytona Beach.

706
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,210
Good girl.

707
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,820
But I was there...

708
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,750
and one night, I was walking back to my hotel,

709
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:00,580
and... I came across this man...

710
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,300
a traveler.

711
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,500
He was wearing ragged clothes

712
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,310
and he had a strange way of talking.

713
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:10,430
And these three young jerks were bothering him.

714
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,060
They were trying to take away his bag of groceries.

715
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,230
And so... I chased the jerks off.

716
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,180
By yourself?

717
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,270
Yeah, by myself.

718
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,680
And I had a few...

719
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,990
vitamin drinks and... I chased them off.

720
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,200
It happened.

721
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,530
And the traveler was so grateful,

722
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,930
he wanted to repay me.

723
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,830
You know, he-he didn't have much,

724
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,970
so he reaches into his little satchel

725
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,810
and he pulls out this shirt.

726
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,340
He says to me that it's a magic T-shirt.

727
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,900
He said,

728
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,860
that when you wear it,

729
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,580
your enemies will see you exactly as

730
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,050
you want to be seen,

731
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,500
and only that way.

732
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,210
Whether it's a... a warrior,

733
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,180
or a princess.

734
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,350
Whatever you want.

735
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,240
- Does it work? - You tell me.

736
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,850
I was wearing this shirt the night I met your mom.

737
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:05,280
And she thought I was the handsomest man in the world.

738
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,870
- You? - Yeah, I know.

739
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,660
Me.

740
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:10,970
Magic.

741
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,730
I'm gonna go with princess.

742
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:30,860
I want you to know...

743
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,660
that your daddy already sees you that way

744
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,920
without the shirt, okay? You don't need it.

745
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:40,140
Thanks, Daddy, but I'm gonna wear it anyway.

746
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:45,810
Okay.

747
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,160
Your Highness.

748
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,980
Need to find you a crown.

749
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,280
Oh, my God, this is not happening.

750
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,160
This is-- are you-- oh.

751
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,570
Toby.

752
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,980
So you're telling me

753
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,800
that you work for my ex-wife?

754
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,950
I didn't mean to, okay? It just happened.

755
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,380
Like, I-I wanted to see her up close.

756
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:20,100
So you... just stalked her like a serial killer.

757
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,240
Josie and I prefer to call it "research."

758
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,160
"Josie and I."

759
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,480
"Josie and I"?

760
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,910
Wha-- how in the hell is there a Josie and I?

761
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:27,750
I don't know.

762
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,340
- I just had to know. - Know what?

763
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,810
Toby, one of these things is not like the other, okay?

764
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,080
So I wondered, like was she fat and then she got skinny?

765
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,230
Was she a terrible person? But no.

766
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,210
She's actually beautiful, and she's great,

767
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,360
and she thinks that I'm great,

768
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,530
and she has amazing taste in imported goods.

769
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,230
Like, feel this.

770
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,350
I don't even know what that is!

771
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,600
It's a portfolio.

772
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,800
And I liked it.

773
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,570
Is that what you want?

774
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,530
Is that what you want? Do you want a skinny person?

775
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:57,150
No, but I would like to be with a sane person, Kate.

776
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,620
That is not nice.

777
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,330
Yeah, well, maybe I'm a little tired of being nice.

778
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,380
Some stranger tells you that you're great and you believe her.

779
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,770
I tell you you're great and you think I'm lying.

780
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,510
Why is that?

781
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,580
I don't... I don't know. I have a problem.

782
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,030
We all have problems, Kate.

783
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,220
Toby, all of my life...

784
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,760
You've been fat.

785
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,440
Yeah, I get it.

786
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,060
I empathize, clearly.

787
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,260
I empathize, then I say something cute,

788
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,730
then you feel better, rinse and repeat.

789
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,890
She was terrible to me, Kate.

790
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:34,020
Josie, this skinny, successful woman

791
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,500
that-that you admire so much?

792
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
She cheated on me, she lied to me,

793
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,710
and then she took half my life savings.

794
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,760
I gained 95 pounds

795
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,870
in one year after she left me.

796
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,290
At my lowest point, I told my brother

797
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,940
that I was committing suicide even though that wasn't true

798
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,340
because I wanted him to be as scared and lonely as I was.

799
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,100
You know what? You know what? That's...

800
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,800
That's a lie, I, uh...

801
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,790
I did consider suicide.

802
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,180
A lot.

803
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,300
When I would get drunk,

804
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,630
alone,

805
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,350
and disgust myself.

806
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,600
So, you haven't cornered the market on problems, Kate.

807
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,580
God, I'm really sorry.

808
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,000
My issues are not gonna go away overnight, Toby.

809
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,060
Well...

810
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:39,930
neither am I.

811
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,510
But Jesus, Kate...

812
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,110
Josie and I

813
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,110
weren't good together.

814
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,530
So we're not.

815
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,900
It's not like I was gonna keep the job anyway.

816
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,720
But you know who are good together?

817
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,370
Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie?

819
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,400
I love them.

820
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,210
And I want them to be my family.

821
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,740
And also us.

822
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,990
We're pretty good together.

823
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,430
But mostly I was talking about Matt and Savannah.

824
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,970
Can I keep the portfolio?

825
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,950
Oh, my God, you're killing me.

826
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:29,860
No.

827
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,770
Do you just want to feel it?

828
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,010
Oh, my God.

829
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,580
What is that?

830
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,530
That's a baby something.

831
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,510
Leave a message for Kate.

832
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,200
Hey, hey, it's me.

833
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,440
I got the part.

834
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,940
Yay, right? I think.

835
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,600
Can you call me? Uh, it's just, you know,

836
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,780
you're-you're usually the one who... who tells me how great I am,

837
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,670
and you're not here.

838
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,120
So...

839
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,450
Man, that Tess was some Snow White tonight, huh?

840
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,380
Yeah.

841
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,900
I've offended you somehow.

842
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,860
- No. - No, I have.

843
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,320
- You think I'm judging you. - I...

844
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:45,980
Because I'm in no position to judge you whatsoever.

845
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,720
But you need to know,

846
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,010
if I was in a position to judge you,

847
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,490
you'd be getting a very high score.

848
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,280
That story you told about helping to bus little black kids in Pittsburgh.

849
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:59,090
- That was '86, '87? - Thereabout.

850
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,200
So you were clean then?

851
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,020
Just... functional?

852
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,960
Because you know what this little black kid was doing?

853
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,590
- I don't... - I was a little boy,

854
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,280
living in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.

855
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,540
Which is pretty much the whitest place on Earth.

856
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,230
I had this little notebook...

857
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,450
and every time I met a new black person,

858
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:23,040
I would put a mark in this notebook.

859
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,810
And every time I met a black man, I wondered if, somehow,

860
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:32,200
if that man could possibly be my father.

861
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,820
But I couldn't say that.

862
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,200
You know, I couldn't say it out loud

863
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,740
because I loved my father.

864
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,620
My white father.

865
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,880
And my white mother.

866
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:54,750
I'm a strong, successful, black man.

867
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,380
My wife and I give a lot of thought

868
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,020
- to how we raise our girls, believe that. - Yes.

869
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,370
The fact that my daughter doesn't find anything unusual

870
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,930
about her playing Snow White?

871
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,630
That's the whole idea.

872
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,320
Right?

873
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,370
Look, I-I don't know everything, William.

874
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,220
I don't.

875
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,670
But I wouldn't change a thing about my parents,

876
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,730
or the way that I parent,

877
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,230
- and I will not apologize for any of it. - You shouldn't.

878
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,960
- Because I don't. - I should.

879
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,780
Three weeks I've known you,

880
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,560
and I still haven't said the words.

881
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,320
- You don't have to say any... - I'm sorry.

882
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,190
I am so deeply sorry.

883
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:42,070
I did everything wrong by you.

884
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,360
And you've done everything right.

885
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,700
You are doing everything right, son.

886
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,200
Well, uh...

887
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,900
Now, you wear whatever you want on your walk tomorrow.

888
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,190
Oh, I like my new flat front khakis just fine.

889
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:24,490
- Baby say what? - Uncle Kevin!

890
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,370
- How are you? - Good.

891
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,440
- How you doing? - I'm good, how are you?

892
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,210
- Oh, you look beautiful. - Thank you.

893
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:30,850
Honey, look, it's Kevin.

894
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,310
- What's up, bro? - Yo!

895
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,200
- What's going on, man? - Oh, you know.

896
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,270
Missing my fan club, of course, you know?

897
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,200
And, uh, you don't mind if I crash for a bit, right?

898
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:41,920
- Absolutely. - For a time.

899
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,230
- Yeah. - Thanks.

900
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,630
Uncle Kevin, I was Snow White!

901
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,350
- Yeah? - You should come see the video, and

902
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,570
we have to call Stacy Klein,

903
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,010
who doesn't believe you're my uncle.

904
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:49,900
You're kidding me, that's ridiculous.

905
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,160
All right, yeah, I'll be right there.

906
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,220
We'll tell her what's up.

907
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,290
- She's cute. - Yeah, she is.

908
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,590
- Uh, Kevin, this is, uh... - Yeah?

909
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:02,210
William, he's my, uh...

910
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:06,920
This is my biological father.

911
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,250
Whom I looked for, and I found,

912
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,220
and this is him.

913
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,850
Uh, well, that probably is gonna be a longer conversation,

914
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,490
but it's good to meet you.

915
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,550
It's a pleasure to meet you.

916
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,910
Uncle Kevin, come on!

917
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,250
- Uh, go. - Okay. All right, yeah, no.

918
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,650
- Let's go. - Go, go, go, go. Yes, yes.

919
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,750
All right, where's my little Annie, huh?

920
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,440
I miss the other half of my fan club.

921
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,560
Was that the Man-ny?

922
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,140
- Yeah. - Yeah.

923
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,550
I love that show.

924
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,950
I'm gonna go get my autograph book.

925
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,710
Hey, is now a bad time to mention having another kid?

926
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,420
Are you reading?

927
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,770
I'm on the last page, come on, baby.

928
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,410
- Yeah. - Please.

932
