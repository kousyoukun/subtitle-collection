00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,070
不過不管怎樣  我已經徹底告別這部劇了
Any... Anyway, this play is a total departure for me,

137
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,610
知道嗎
you know?

138
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,240
奶爸什麼的  都一刀兩斷了
None of that, like, Manny stuff.

139
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,420
這對我來說是劇中人物的告別
It's a character-driven departure for me.

140
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,270
你在聽嗎  你看什麼呢
Where'd you go? What are you looking at?

141
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,100
兄弟  我得掛了
Hey, man, uh, I gotta go.

142
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,320
你就這樣掛他電話啊
You're just gonna hang up on him?

143
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,640
不不不  我不會給你看身份證的
No, no, no, I will not show you my I.D.

144
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,390
除非你告訴我  你為什麼要看
Not until you tell me why you need a reason to see it.

145
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,320
托尼  發生什麼事了
Tony, what's going on here?

146
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,340
皮爾森先生  有人舉報他四處徘徊
Hey, Mr. Pearson. We had a report of someone loitering.

147
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,630
我沒有四處徘徊
I wasn't loitering.

148
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,730
我是在散步
I was taking my walk, and literally

149
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,390
確切地說是去品味玫瑰花香
on my way to smell the roses,

150
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,380
-就像上週一樣  -我知道
- as I have been for the past week. - ?I know.

151
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,270
這媄纗D還有什麼禁止賞花的法律
Is there some local rose smelling ordinance

152
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,740
-我沒聽說的嗎  -威廉  夠了
- I'm not aware of? - ?William, enough.

153
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,680
夠了
Enough...

154
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,310
他是和你一起的嗎  先生
He's with you, sir?

155
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,060
是的  他和我們住一起
Yeah, he's staying with us.

156
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,570
-不好意思  -還不好意思
- Sorry. ?- Sorry?

157
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,870
我們很抱歉
We're so sorry.

158
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,660
我們不知道情況  蘭德爾
We didn't know, Randall.

159
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,010
明白  謝謝
Understood. Thanks.

160
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,340
謝謝你  托尼
Thank you, Tony.

161
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,480
我們得給你買些新衣服了
We're gonna get you some new clothes.

162
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,890
我討厭甘藍
I hate kale.

163
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,970
我也是
Me, too.

164
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,290
小芝麻菜和大芝麻菜一樣難吃
Baby arugula is just as bad as grown-up arugula.

165
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,310
算了
All right, you know what?

166
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,180
我們買單吧
Here we go.

167
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,910
不行  不行  讓我來...
Oh, no, no, no. Let me get--

168
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,060
別忘了  你失業了
Remember, you are unemployed.

169
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,500
而且我也不信你能
And I am not convinced that you would do well

170
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,570
-靠乞討度日  -你在開玩笑嗎
- begging for money. - Are you kidding?

171
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,010
你不覺得司機們要是看到
You don't think the drivers will be sympathetic to me

172
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,680
我舉著個"沒飯吃"的牌子會很同情我嗎
holding up a sign that says "Hungry?"

173
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,130
那就好
That's good.

174
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,430
我去下衛生間  然後就走  行嗎
I'm gonna use the restroom, and then we'll go, okay?

175
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:35,890
你過得怎麼樣
How are you?

176
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,740
-挺好的  你呢  -不錯
- Uh, good. How are you? - ?Good.

177
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,210
好了  你要走了嗎
Okay, uh... you wanna get out of here?

178
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,910
-那是誰  -哪個
- Who was that? ?- Who was...

179
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,200
你看到了啊  那是我前妻
You saw that. Uh, that was my ex-wife.

180
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,590
等下  你是說真的嗎
Wait, are you serious?

181
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,720
是啊  我跟你說過我結過婚
Yeah. I told you I was married before.

182
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,300
可沒說是這種
Not to that.

183
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,160
{\an8}我們的生活
第一季  第四集

184
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,750
超模來了  擺姿勢了  再來貓步
Supermodel, pose... and catwalk.

185
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,110
凱特  別傻了
Hey, Kate, stop being silly.

186
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,370
快過來
Come over here, please.

187
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,700
薩曼莎和薇琪也來了
Samantha and Vicki are here!

188
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,250
-愛心熊  -好了  兩張椅子了
- Care Bears! - Okay, that's two.

189
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,720
親愛的  我是出賣肉體才換來的椅子
Babe, I had to sleep with someone to get this one.

190
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,220
-希望你原諒我  -我沒問題啊
- I hope that's okay. - Yeah, I'm fine with it.

191
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,920
只要他老婆不介意就好
As long as his wife is okay with it.

192
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,870
凱文  到你了  把衣服脫了
Kevin, you're up, please. Shirt off.

193
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,620
為什麼  我都不愛游泳
Why? I don't even like swimming.

194
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,940
你不一定頭也要潛下去
You don't have to put your face in.

195
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,370
你可以待在淺水區  蘭德爾會陪你的
You can sit in the shallow end and Randall will stay with you.

196
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,640
我也不喜歡蘭德爾
I don't like Randall either.

197
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,830
-小凱  幹嘛呢  -別說了
- Hey, Kev, come on. - Enough.

198
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,750
轉過去
Turn around.

199
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,210
蘭德爾  到你了
Randall, you're up, please.

200
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,600
過來吧
Come here.

201
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
轉身
Turn around, please.

202
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,950
你確定我還需要塗防曬霜嗎
Are you sure I really need sunscreen?

203
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,650
-肯定要  -要啊  當然
- Yes, absolutely. ?- Yeah, absolutely.

204
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,320
你當然要塗了
Of course you do. Sure.

205
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,350
三個小傢伙  快過來
Okay, look, Big Three, come here.

206
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,280
過來  你們周圍有很多大人
Come here. You are surrounded by adults

207
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,520
和同樣是大人的救生員
and lifeguards that resemble adults.

208
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,230
你們應該不會遇上...
There's very little trouble you can actually get into--

209
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,930
等等  等下  凱特  寶貝
Wait, wait. Kate, baby,

210
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,030
你確定不再套件衣服嗎
are you sure you don't want to put a shirt on?

211
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,630
-好吧  -給
- Right. - ?Here.

212
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,050
好好看你的書吧
Enjoy your Misery.

213
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,580
大家都盯著她的泳衣看  傑克
People are staring at her in that bathing suit, Jack.

214
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,850
那些小混球一定會說三道四的
Some jerky little kid is gonna say something.

215
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,000
那只是嬰兒肥
It's baby fat.

216
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,950
她才八歲  孩子們這會兒什麼都不懂
She's only eight years old. Kids haven't turned mean yet.

217
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,010
凱文最近是怎麼了  態度那麼差
And what is up with Kevin lately, and that attitude?

218
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,860
-他太嫉妒蘭德爾了  -他沒事
- He's so jealous of Randall. - He's fine.

219
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,090
寶貝  他沒事  他們仨都很好
Babe, he's fine. They are all fine.

220
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,420
還有蘭德爾需要抹防曬霜嗎
And does Randall need sunscreen?

221
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,170
這些年來我們都是在他身上浪費防曬霜嗎
I mean, have we just been wasting sunscreen all of these years?

222
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,100
這個我也不知道
That I have no answer for.

223
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,210
椅子  椅子
Chair. Chair!

224
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,480
小心點
Careful!

225
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,710
她只是他的前妻  凱特
She's his ex-wife, Kate.

226
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,310
好嗎  關鍵字是"前"
All right? The operative word being "Ex."

227
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,150
他們已經離婚了  他現在和你在一起
They're not together anymore. He's with you now.

228
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,760
可為什麼呢  你真該瞧瞧她
"Why?" is the question. You should see her.

229
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,520
{\an8}凱文

230
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,310
也許那才是托比想要的
Maybe that's what Toby wants.

231
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,320
也許他看上我是為了滿足他的胖妞癖
Maybe he's fulfilling a fat-girl fetish with me.

232
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,860
確實有這種癖好
Well, that's actually a thing.

233
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,430
當然  對我來說
Of course, for me it was

234
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,040
那更像是一階段  但也差不多
more of a phase than a thing, but anyway...

235
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,930
我仔細調查了下這女人
I did a deep dive with this woman.

236
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,370
她的一切都如此完美
Everything reeks fabulous.

237
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,480
完美的品位  完美的朋友
She has fabulous taste, she has fabulous friends.

238
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,210
她還去過阿根廷  凱文
She's been to Argentina, Kevin!

239
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,910
聽我說  我把你留在洛杉磯
Listen to me, I did not leave you in Los Angeles

240
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,610
不是讓你自我糟踐的
so you could self-sabotage, okay?

241
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,590
所以趕緊把網頁關掉  立刻馬上
So get off the Internet-- do that right now--

242
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,070
告訴我怎麼做才能通過試鏡
and tell me how hard I'm gonna crush this audition.

243
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,760
邊緣消失了
The edges are gone...

244
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,130
事情也隨之發生了
and then the thing.

245
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,080
謝謝你  肖恩·帕特塈J
Thank you, Sean Patrick.

246
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,270
我覺得有幾個人挺不錯
Some good choices, I thought.

247
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,460
丹尼爾不錯  其他人演得爛透了
It's Daniel. Everyone else sucks.

248
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,740
其實我更喜歡...
You know, I kind of liked--

249
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,920
就選丹尼爾
It's Daniel.

250
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,120
稍等  稍等
Hold on, hold on.

251
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,380
還有一位  凱文·皮爾森
We have one more. Kevin Pearson.

對不起  我知道  很抱歉我遲到了
Sorry. I know, I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late.

253
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,890
我本來想坐地鐵  再一路走過來
It's just, you know, I tried to take the subway, right,

254
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,510
像紐約客那樣
and then walk, like a New Yorker.

255
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,040
我是羅恩·希勒
Ron Shiller.

256
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,470
這位是斯隆·桑德伯格
This is Sloane Sandberg.

257
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,210
-你就是編劇  -劇作家
- You're the, uh, screenwriter. - Playwright.

258
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,950
你總是要邁出第一步的
Well, you know, I mean, you gotta start somewhere.

259
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,920
今天你和梅英小姐對戲  如果你不介意的話
You'll be reading with Miss Maine today, if that's okay.

260
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,360
當然  和誰都行
Yeah, no, whatever you got, you know.

261
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,370
緬因州小姐  愛荷華州小姐
Miss Maine, Miss Iowa.

262
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,220
我曾評選過支持特朗普美國小姐
I judged, uh, Miss USA for Trump once,

263
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,330
所以我們可能見過面
so we may have actually met before.

264
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,120
梅英小姐全名是奧利維亞·梅英
Miss Maine is Olivia Maine.

265
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,660
托尼獎提名獲得者

在開始之前  我有...
Well, before we start, I just wanted to...

269
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,330
我有幾句話必須要說
I want to get something off my chest.

270
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,910
我知道你們的看法
I do understand the perception, you know.

271
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,400
洛杉磯的演員們來到這
These L.A. actors, they come out here, right?

272
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,740
來劇院媕H便演幾個小角色
They do their little quick stint in theater

273
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,340
只為滿足自己的虛榮心
just to feel better about themselves.

274
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,800
而我卻不是  好嗎
That's not why I'm here, okay?

275
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,020
我來這是有正當理由的
I'm here for the right reasons.

276
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,290
那我們趕緊把這戲對完吧  可以嗎
Let's get this over with, shall we?

277
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,760
你想讓我先開始嗎
Did you want me to start?

278
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,560
沒錯  我覺得那樣比較好
Yes, I thought it would be good, if,

279
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,950
你先說  我後說
you speak, then I speak,

280
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,670
接著你再說  然後我們就可以回家了
then you speak, and we all go home.

281
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,700
你覺得可以嗎
Does that work for you?

282
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,070
行啊  很好
Yeah. That's great...

283
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,570
我的記憶有點模糊了  這一天實在太漫長了
My recollection's hazy, actually, it was a long day.

284
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,780
我可不是  早上九點前我的一天就結束了
Not for me. Mine was over before 9:00 in the morning.

285
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,310
你的口音真棒
That's really good... accent.

286
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,750
-你說什麼  -美國口音
- What? - ?The American accent.

287
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,180
什麼
What?

288
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,070
我正...  努力融入角色
I just... diving... diving right back in.

289
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,480
台詞是...  "我躺在"  我不...
It say, uh... it says "I lay," uh, I don't...

290
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,420
我說...我不需要說這個  台詞是...
Let me just say... I don't need to say it. It says...

291
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,420
我還是說吧
I'll just say it.

292
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,760
我躺在...
I lay...

293
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,990
繼續繼續
Just keep going.

294
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,420
真是...
This is...

295
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,590
我能搞定
I'll get it.

296
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,690
我整夜躺在碼頭上
I lay on the dock all night,

297
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,040
直至天明
and part of the next morning.

298
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,090
卻感受不到任何東西
And I don't feel a thing.

299
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,000
我再來一遍
Let me take that again.

300
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,620
我的天  我的天
Oh, my gosh... Oh, my gosh.

301
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,020
好的  寶貝說什麼...
Okay. Baby say what...

302
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,830
好了  我躺在...  讓我醞釀下
Okay. I-I lay... Let me get into it.

303
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,250
我整夜躺在碼頭上直至天明
I lay on the dock all night and part of the next morning.

304
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,450
卻感受不到任何東西
And I don't feel a thing.

305
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,710
蚊蟲叮咬  皮膚曬傷  都沒有感覺
The bug bites, the sunburn. Nothin'.

306
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,980
就像我們以前一起去釣魚時  你還記得嗎
It's like when we used to go fishing. You remember?

307
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,280
-我從沒釣過魚  -你是下一句...
- I never fished... - Do you have the next...

308
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,560
-你搞什麼鬼  -對不起
- What the hell? - ?Sorry.

309
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,880
你沒說話  我還以為...
You weren't talking, so I thought...

310
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,280
這叫停頓
It's called a pause.

311
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,170
是
Right.

312
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,020
抱歉  我的劇本上沒寫有停頓...
Sorry. It doesn't say pause on my script...

313
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,870
上面也沒寫爛呢  可我們現在不就是這樣嗎
Well, it doesn't say suck, either, yet here we are.

314
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,070
你知道你的尺碼嗎
You know your size?

315
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,220
我總是挑修身的穿
Always tended toward the slim.

316
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,610
估計現在也還沒變吧
I don't see that changing much at this point.

317
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,690
試試這些
Try these.

318
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,610
完了我們順路去一趟藥店
Afterwards, we'll swing by the pharmacy,

319
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,090
把醫生給你開的藥拿了
get those medications that the doctor wrote for you.

320
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,430
聽起來挺好的
Sounds like a plan.

321
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,520
一百美元
$100?

322
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,020
就是這個價
It's what they cost.

323
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,710
我買單  你就買吧
I'm paying, just take the pants.

324
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,060
我們要不要談談
So are we gonna talk about it or not?

325
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,400
談什麼
Talk about what?

326
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,040
談什麼  談今天早上的事
About what. Uh, this morning.

327
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,790
還是你就想臭著張臉卻什麼也不說
Or are you content to stand in silent judgment with that face?

328
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,290
我的臉平時就這樣
It's just my face.

329
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,800
不  你是不喜歡我替你道歉
No, you didn't like me apologizing for you.

330
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,430
我懂
I get it.

331
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,600
如果我把事情鬧大你是不是就高興了
Would you have been happier if I made a big scene?

332
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,440
揍托尼一頓
You know, got up in Tony's face,

333
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,010
把警察招來然後對著我們噴水槍
had the cops roll up and turn the hoses on us?

334
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,560
他們是卡斯格拉夫一家
It's the Cosgroves.

335
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,950
先生開了一家保險公司  妻子收藏貓頭鷹
He runs an insurance agency, she collects owls.

336
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,300
歷史可不會站在我們這一邊
History would not have memorialized our stand.

337
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,850
你被水槍噴過嗎
You ever had a hose turned on you?

338
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,380
很抱歉  我沒有過
Can't say that I have, I'm very sorry.

339
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,810
不要嘗試  很疼的
Don't be. It hurts.

340
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,080
就是這個表情
And there's that face.

341
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,470
我就是這種表情  我還想買幾雙襪子
Only face I got. Look, I could use some socks...

342
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,570
這個表情  就好像是在說你胳膊上
No, the face. The one that says I have a scar

343
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,890
還有當年為送孩子們上學留下的疤痕
on my arm from integrating schools.

344
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,790
說不定腳上還有為自由遊行時留下的水泡
And probably blisters on your feet from marching for freedom,

345
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,410
至於我  因為我成長於白人家庭
but me, because I grew up in a white house,

346
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,990
你就認為我不懂黑人的生活
you think I don't live in a black man's world.

347
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,990
你知道你是什麼表情
Oh, you know the one.

348
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,590
你的表情讓那個營業員從我們進門那一刻起
The one where that salesman there has been eyeballing us

349
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,970
就一直盯著我們
ever since we came in here.

350
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,680
還有那個保安的位置挪動了一點點
Or where that security guard has moved just a little

351
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,890
只為更好地監視我們
off his mark so he can keep us in his sight.

352
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,120
還有他們肯定會在我付錢的時候
And where they'll definitely ask

353
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,600
請我出示信用卡的用戶證明
for an ID with my credit card when I go to pay,

354
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,980
儘管他們從沒向其他人提出過這樣的要求
even though they haven't asked for anybody else's.

355
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,810
再加上每天類似這樣的無數件小事
Plus a million things every day

356
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,750
我都要選擇無視
that I have to choose to let go,

357
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,180
這樣我才不會把自己氣死
just so I'm not pissed off all the time.

358
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,690
就像我今早在街上做的一樣
Like I did on the street this morning.

359
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,620
就和我每天做的事一樣
Like I have done every day of my life.

360
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,850
快去試試你的修身無褶休閒褲吧
Now try on the damn slim cut flat front chinos.

361
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,690
你穿著肯定好看
I think they'll look nice on you.

362
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,670
蘭德爾
Randall

363
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,740
看
Watch!

364
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,410
太酷了
Cool! Cool!

365
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,990
爸  看我  爸
Dad, watch! Dad!

366
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,200
-另外一個去哪兒了  -我在找
- Where's the other one? - I'm looking.

367
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,420
天啊  只要一秒鐘不盯著一個
Man, you take your eyes off one for a second,

368
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,550
其他的就也都不見了
you lose track of the others.

369
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,060
那是因為他們人數
That's because there are more of them

370
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,250
比咱倆多呀
than there are of us.

371
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,580
永遠都會是這樣
Always will be.

372
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,040
什麼
What? Oh.

373
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,030
在說孩子們呀
Talking about the kids.

374
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,710
是啊  他們人多勢眾
Yep. It's a war. They got the numbers.

375
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,360
-爸爸  爸爸  -我們還沒開始就累趴了
- Dad! Dad! - We were beat before we started.

376
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,890
-看我  -她在那兒呢
- Watch! - There she is.

377
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,340
你們好
Hi. Hey, guys.

378
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,620
想玩美人魚嗎
You want to play mermaids?

379
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,530
這是我們所有人寫給你的
This is from all of us.

380
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,410
爸爸
Dad!

381
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,970
爸爸  爸爸
Dad! Daddy! Dad!

382
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,090
爸爸  快看我
Dad, watch me!

383
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,360
好  我看見你了
Yeah. I see you, pal!

384
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,320
還記得他第一次叫我爸爸的時候 
Do you remember the first time he said "Dad"?

385
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,400
我有多高興嗎
How happy I was?

386
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,520
蘭德爾去哪兒了
Now where's Randall?

387
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,180
怎麼樣  你們看見了嗎
How about that time? Did you see?

388
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,970
小凱  你弟弟呢
Hey, Kev. Where's your brother?

389
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,950
我不知道
I don't know!

390
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,310
傑克
Jack.

391
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,620
你去岸上找  我看看水
You take land, I'll take sea.

392
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,280
爸爸  快看我
Dad! Watch!

393
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,130
凱文
Kevin.

394
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,330
你們應該互相照看對方的
You were supposed to watch each other!

395
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,510
蘭德爾
Randall!

396
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,460
蘭德爾
Randall!

397
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,900
凱特  這真是史上
Kate, it was the worst audition

398
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,770
最糟糕的一次面試了
in the history of the world. Okay?

399
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,840
那女的搞得我超級緊張
I mean, that woman made me so nervous,

400
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,120
中途我居然無緣無故地
I started doing an English accent

401
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,680
說起了英式口音
in the middle of it for no reason!

402
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,490
肯定沒有那麼糟吧
Okay, I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

403
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,480
也許這才是問題所在
Maybe that's the problem. You know?

404
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,670
-我太想得到這個角色了  -這不是奶爸嗎

463
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,130
-你在這兒幹什麼呢  -不不不

Okay, it's... I-I have him now. I'm sorry,

466
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,340
我是他媽媽  我差點嚇壞了  我叫麗貝卡
I'm his mother. I was a little panicked. I'm Rebecca.

467
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,570
我們知道你是誰
We know who you are.

468
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,090
你們知道
You do?

469
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,280
沒錯  如果一個白人家庭帶著一個黑人小孩
Oh yes. When a white family has a black child

470
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,790
也沒有向我們介紹過自己
and they don't introduce themselves to any of us,

471
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,650
我們一般都會多加注意
we tend to take notice.

472
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,870
謝謝你照看他
Well. Thank you for watching him.

473
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,890
只是他不該在這兒的
He's just not supposed to be over here.

474
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,840
不是說這埵酗偵礞ㄕn
Not "over here" like that.

475
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,620
來這兒沒什麼不對
There's nothing wrong with over here.

476
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,470
我的意思是他應該待在我們的視線範圍內
I just mean that I want him where we can see him,

477
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,190
也就是我們坐的地方  我們面前
where we're sitting, in front of us.

478

謝謝你  很高興認識你

Actually, you stay right here.

482
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,220
那是我的兒子  我是他媽媽
That's my son, and I'm his mother.

483
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,080
我不知道你是不是
And I don't know if you have

484
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,480
對這樣的家庭有什麼意見
some sort of problem with that arrangement,

485
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,840
但是我真的不在乎
but also, I don't really care.

486
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,100
總之謝謝你幫我照看我們的孩子
Thank you very much for watching my son.

487

剃刀都把他脖子劃傷了

491
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,420
你需要找個知道怎麼理黑人頭髮的理髮店
You need a barber who knows how to cut black hair.

492
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,580

493
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,610
我跟你說了讓你跟哥哥待在一起  不是嗎
I told you to stay with your brother, didn't I?

494
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,550
對不起
Sorry.

495
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,740
這就是你想來這個泳池  不去其它泳池的
Is this the real reason you wanted to come to this pool

496
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,730
真正原因嗎
and not the other?

497
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,220

我周遊四方
I have traveled this land and many others,

503
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,670

and never have I seen a beauty so fair.

504
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,770

您來到這森林中又是所為何事呢
What errand brings you to the forest?

506

我來自遙遠之地

509
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,840
我的意思是  雖然我沒有讀過很多劇本
I mean, I don't read a lot of plays,

510
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,750
-但那個很不錯  -我明白

聽著  那部劇...
No, look, it's...

512
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,430
真的很棒
it's really good, actually.

513
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,640
我是說  很精緻
I mean, it's... it's fragile.

514
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,950
微妙而細緻
It's -- it's delicate.

515
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,490
你從哪堥茠  凱文·皮爾森

我老家在匹茲堡
Uh... Pittsburgh, originally.

518
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,850
你的家人在匹茲堡嗎
You got family back there?

519
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,970
現在不在了
Um... not anymore.

520
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,800
所以現在你以洛杉磯為家了
Right, so, L.A. is home now?

521
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,790

而且是以朋友的身份告訴你
And I'm telling you this as a friend

528
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,080
因為這種事我見得太多了
because I see this all the time.

529
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,970
你自己也說了
I mean, you said it yourself.

演過電視劇和電影的帥哥美女來到這
Pretty people come here from TV or movies

531
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,730
因為他們想來點真格的
because they want to do something real.

532
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,830
即便他們...
I mean, even if they've...

533
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,490
他們一輩子都不曾真誠過
they've never had a genuine moment in their entire lives.

534
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,730
你知道他們明白了什麼嗎
Do you know what they find out?

535
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,320
猜猜看
That guess what?

536
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,100
太難了
It's hard.

537
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,900
實在是太艱難了
It's so hard.

538
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,740
並不是...
It's not...

It's not...

543
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,010
不好意思  你演的那部電影叫什麼來著
I'm sorry, what-what-what was the-the movie you were in?

544
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,320
實際上是部電視劇
It was a TV show, actually,

545
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,670
名叫《靚男保姆》
called, uh, The Man-ny.

546
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,660
是啊  聽我說
Yeah, and look,

547
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,460
我不是說
I'm not saying that

548
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,740
這個角色你演得不好
you're not good at what you do.

549
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,930
我相信你肯定...
I'm sure you're...

550
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,100
肯定非常出色
you're great at it.

551
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,890
我就演不了這個角色
I mean, I-I couldn't do it.

552
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,380
但你演電視劇和這堿O兩碼事
But this... is not that.

553
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,640
你的能力不夠
You're in over your head,

554
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,410
凱文·皮爾森
Kevin Pearson.

555
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,730
如果你真想演這個  就回家去
I mean, if you really want to do this, then go home,

556
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,010
報個班  學習一下
find a class, get some training.

557
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,080
我是實話實說
I'm just being honest.

558
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,490
我懂了
I see.

559
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,460
以朋友的身份
As a... as a friend.

560
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,690
-是的  -好吧
- Yeah. - Yeah.

561
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,500
可我還是覺得
Still, just, you know, it feels like

562
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,180
"朋友"這個詞你用錯了
you're using the word "Friend" wrong.

563
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,500
出什麼事了嗎
Everything all right?

564
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,760
-你還好嗎  -還好
- You okay? - Yeah.

565
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:14,660
真的嗎
Yeah?

566
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,380
好著呢
Yeah.

567
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,960
你拿到了那個角色
You got the part.

568
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,000
等一下  不好意思  你說什麼
Wait, I'm sorry, what?

569
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,130
他們覺得"保姆"來演會熱賣
They think the nanny will sell tickets.

570
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,130
其實是《靚男保姆》
It was actually The Man-ny.

571
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,810
爸  快看  我要潛下去了
Dad, look! I'm going under and everything!

572
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,400
爸爸
Dad!

573
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,040
-我看著你呢  夥計  -蘭德爾
- Yeah, I see you, pal! - Randall.

574
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,040
-爸爸  -午飯  寶貝
- Dad! - Lunch, baby.

575
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,930
-爸爸  -也許她只是
- Dad! - You know, maybe she was just

576
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,260
-想幫個忙  -爸爸  看我
- trying to be helpful. - Dad! Watch!

577
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,390
居高臨下地教我怎麼養孩子  就這麼幫忙嗎
By condescendingly telling me how I could raise my kid? Yeah.

578
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,880
-不了  謝謝  -爸爸
- No, thank you. - Dad!

579
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,520
*我愛我爸爸  很愛很愛他*
*I love my father and I love him well...*

580
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,730
*希望不久後的某一天能見到他*
*I hope to see him someday soon*

581
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,490
*我愛我爸爸  很愛很愛他*
*I love my father and I love him well*

582
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,330
*希望不久後的某一天能見到他*
*I hope to see him someday soon*

583
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,510
*因為我住的地方  到了晚上又黑又暗*
*'Cause where I live  It gets dark at night*

584
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,230
*那種黑暗會吞噬光明*
*The kind of dark eats up the light*

585
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,220
*我住的地方  到了晚上又黑又暗*
*Yeah, where I live  It gets dark at night*

586
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,960
*那種黑暗會吞噬光明*
*The kind of dark eats up the light*

587
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,740
*你知道的媽媽*
*And you know that, mother*

588
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,710
*我在說謊*
*I'd be lying*

589
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,690
*如果我說我不怕夜晚*
*If I didn't tell you I'm afraid of night.*

590
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,550
凱特  你怎麼不吃東西
Kate, you're not eating.

591
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,430
你還好嗎
You okay?

592
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:53,820
她怎麼了
What's up with her?

593
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,020
逗我呢吧  為什麼
Are you kidding me?! Oh! Why?

594
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,060
因為我們沒讓她穿T恤  就因為這個
Because we didn't make her wear a T-shirt, that's why.

595
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,220
不  傑克  這只會讓情況更糟
No, no, Jack, you're only gonna make it worse.

596
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,060
坐下
Sit...

597
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,620
坐下  真的
Sit down. Seriously.

598
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,060
我差點就淹死了
I almost drowned!

599
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,510
-什麼  -你們留意過我嗎
- What? - Did you even care?

600
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,870
-什麼時候  -我都要潛到池底去了
- When? - I tried to get to the deep end,

601
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,680
-可你們看都不看我一眼  -冷靜下來
- but you never watch me. - Hey. Calm down.

602
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,040
-你總是盯著他們  -凱文  凱文
- You always watch them. - Kev, Kev, Kev.

603
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,120
-好了  -別碰我
- Come on... - Don't touch me.

604
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,320
當心點兒  孩子
Watch yourself, pal.

605
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:22,420
你們一直忙著不讓凱特吃得太多
And you're so busy making sure that Kate's not eating too much...

606
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,430
凱文  冷靜一下
Kev, calm down.

607
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,420
還要不讓蘭德爾覺得自己是被領養的
and... and Randall's not too adopted,

608
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,690
可這個時候凱文去哪了呢
and meanwhile, where's Kevin?

609
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,470
你們猜猜看
Oh, guess what?

610
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,830
他死了
He's dead.

611
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,850
孩子  我們愛你  我們看著你呢
Bud, we love you. We were watching...

612
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:32,640
別碰我
Don't touch me.

613
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,620
交給我吧
I got this one.

614
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,370
過來  過來
Hey, come here. Come here.

615
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:37,950
-幹什麼  -抱歉  抱歉
- What? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

616
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,000
對不起
I'm sorry.

617
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,300
好嗎  我該一直看著你的
Okay? I should have been watching.

618
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,110
-好嗎  -你是該看著我
- Okay? - You should have.

619
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,450
我承認錯誤  我該一直看著你
And I said I was and I should have been watching you, pal.

620
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,320
我在努力  好嗎
I'm trying, okay?

621
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,800
聽我說  我知道我比你年紀大
Look, I know that I'm bigger than you.

622
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,000
我知道我是成年人了
I know that I'm an adult,

623
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,970
但我也是第一次經歷這些  好嗎
but I... th-th-this is my first time, okay?

624
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,450
我也是第一次
This is my first time, too.

625
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,400
我有了你們三個  我在努力
I got three of you and I'm trying.

626
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,240
對不起  我本該在你身邊的
I'm sorry. I should've been there.

627
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,300
我以後都會在你身邊的  好嗎
And I'm gonna be there, okay?

628
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,180
好
Okay.

629
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,180
能給我一個擁抱嗎
Can I have a hug?

630
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,550
能說句"爸爸我愛你"嗎
Can I get a "Dad, I love you"?

631
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,180
你有理髮師的名字嗎
Do you have the name of a barber?

632
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,610
有
I do.

633
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,570
勞煩你告訴我
Well, I would appreciate it.

634
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,680
我寫給你
Then I'll write it down.

635
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,480
他上岸之後
When he gets out of the pool,

636
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,030
你得給他塗點乳液
you need to put lotion on him

637
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,150
不然皮膚會變灰
or he gets ashy.

638
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,270
乳液  好的
Lotion. Okay.

639
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,480
謝謝
Thank you.

640
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,730
我兒子平時放學後
Do you think that my son could play with yours

641
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,890
能跟你家小孩一起玩嗎
sometime after school?

642
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,900
當然
Yeah, yeah.

643
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,110
沒問題
I think we can do that.

644
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,890
還有他到底需不需要塗防曬
And does he need sunscreen or not?

645
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,540
是要的吧
He does, right?

646
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,510
我覺得要
I thought he did.

647
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,670
我就知道
I knew he did!

648
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,410
你能幫我跟我老公說說嗎
Can you tell my husband that, please?

649
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,820
我沒帶簡歷  抱歉
Uh, I didn't bring a resume, sorry.

650
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,280
我不知道要面試
I didn't think I'd have a job interview.

651
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,060
我以為就是拿張申請表
And I thought I would just pick up an application...

652
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,620
既然都來了  那就聊聊吧
Oh, well, you're here and I'm here, let's talk.

653
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,770
你皮膚真好
You have really pretty skin.

654
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,180
謝謝
Oh, thank you.

655
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,720
你也是
So do you.

656
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,530
謝謝
Thanks.

657
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,500
凱特  你對我和我的店的背景有瞭解嗎
So, Kate, do you know anything about my store or my background?

658
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,030
一點點
Hmm... A little.

659
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,810
我知道你在2013年開了這家店
I know that you've had this store since 2013

660
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,410
在這之前你開網店賣你的獨立設計
and before that you sold your own designs on Etsy,

661
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,460
直到後來你跟人合夥
until you partnered with that woman

662
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,510
是你加州大學聖克魯茲分校的同學
that you met at UC Santa Cruz--

663
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,690
加油  香蕉蛞蝓[UCSC吉祥物]go, banana slugs--

664
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,050
你去泰國參加了她的婚禮
at her wedding in Thailand.

665
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,810
太美了
Oh, so beautiful.

666
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,720
簡直是夢想之旅
Like, that is my dream trip.

667
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,860
後來你進口了這些圍巾
And then you imported those scarves

668
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,520
生意從此走上了正軌
then it just, like, took off from there.

669
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,840
還有你離婚了  沒有小孩
Oh, and you're divorced, you have no kids

670
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,930
你戴寬檐帽的樣子太好看了
and you look amazing in wide-brimmed hats.

671
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,500
我猜的
I assume.

672
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,890
你頭型很適合
You just have the head for it.

673
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,470
我不適合  我戴著就像個奶嘴
I don't. I look like a pacifier.

674
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:19,120
我喜歡面試前做足功課的人
I like a person who does her research before an interview.

675
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,590
我最會做功課了
I'm a big researcher.

676
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,610
還好嗎
Hey, what's up?

677
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,300
好消息是我找了份工作
So, the good news is: I got a job.

678
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,970
意思是還有壞消息
Well, that means that there's bad news.

679
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,700
{\an8}嚴禁奔跑

680
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,400
成人游泳時間
Adult swim.

681
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,110
小孩都上岸
Adult swim only.

682
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,570
你冷嗎
You cold?

683
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,830
T恤呢
T-shirt?

684
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,290
我沒帶
I didn't bring one.

685
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,460
那...
Well...

686
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,120
我帶了件T恤
I brought a T-shirt.

687
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,550
媽媽討厭這件
That's the one Mommy hates.

688
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,020
媽媽只是妒忌
Oh, Mommy's just jealous.

689
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,230
我不覺得
I don't think so.

690
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,070
是真的
Well, it's true.

691
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,630
她只是假裝討厭
She just pretends like she hates it

692
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,060
因為我不給她穿
because I won't let her wear it.

693
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,630
你知道這件衣服從哪來的嗎
You know where I got this shirt?

694
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,690
我聽媽媽說是個癮君子流浪漢的
I heard Mommy say it was from a drugged-out drifter.

695
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,630
媽媽不太瞭解情況
Listen, Mommy doesn't know the whole truth,

696
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,730
你別跟別人說  好嗎
so this is gonna have to stay between us, okay?

697
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,960
我當時
I got it...

698
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,920
在佛羅里達
in Florida.

699
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,370
一個叫代托納比奇的神奇的地方
A magical land called Daytona Beach.

700
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,540
我們能去那嗎
Can we go there?

701
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,680
不行
No.

702
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,750
你不能去代托納比奇
No, you may never go to Daytona Beach.

703
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,940
我要你大聲說出來
I want you to say it out loud:

704
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,890
"爸爸  我絕對不去代托納比奇"
"Daddy, I will never go to Daytona Beach."

705
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,300
爸爸  我絕對不去代托納比奇
Daddy, I will never go to Daytona Beach.

706
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,210
乖
Good girl.

707
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,820
我當時就在那
But I was there...

708
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,750
一天晚上  我在回酒店的路上
and one night, I was walking back to my hotel,

709
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:00,580
然後遇見了一個人
and... I came across this man...

710
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,300
一個旅客
a traveler.

711
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,500
他穿得破破爛爛的
He was wearing ragged clothes

712
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,310
口音很奇怪
and he had a strange way of talking.

713
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:10,430
有三個壞蛋在欺負他
And these three young jerks were bothering him.

714
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,060
他們想拿走他的一袋生活用品
They were trying to take away his bag of groceries.

715
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,230
所以我把那些壞蛋趕跑了
And so... I chased the jerks off.

716
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,180
你一個人
By yourself?

717
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,270
是的  就我一個人
Yeah, by myself.

718
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,680
我之前喝了幾杯
And I had a few...

719
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,990
維他命飲料  把他們趕跑了
vitamin drinks and... I chased them off.

720
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,200
真事兒
It happened.

721
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,530
這個旅客非常感激
And the traveler was so grateful,

722
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,930
想報答我
he wanted to repay me.

723
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,830
但他有的東西不多
You know, he-he didn't have much,

724
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,970
所以他把手伸進他的小包
so he reaches into his little satchel

725
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,810
掏出了這件衣服
and he pulls out this shirt.

726
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,340
他跟我說這是件有魔法的T恤
He says to me that it's a magic T-shirt.

727
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,900
他說
He said,

728
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,860
當你穿上它的時候
that when you wear it,

729
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,580
你的對手就會看到你希望他們
your enemies will see you exactly as

730
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,050
看到的樣子
you want to be seen,

731
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,500
而且只能看到那個樣子
and only that way.

732
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,210
無論你想成為武士也好
Whether it's a... a warrior,

733
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,180
公主也好
or a princess.

734
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,350
任何形象都行
Whatever you want.

735
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,240
-真的有用嗎  -你說呢
- Does it work? - You tell me.

736
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,850
我遇見你媽媽那晚  就穿著這件衣服
I was wearing this shirt the night I met your mom.

737
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:05,280
她當時覺得我是世界上最帥的男人
And she thought I was the handsomest man in the world.

738
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,870
-你嗎  -是啊  
- You? - Yeah, I know.

739
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,660
就是我
Me.

740
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:10,970
魔法
Magic.

741
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,730
我選擇做公主
I'm gonna go with princess.

742
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:30,860
你得知道...
I want you to know...

743
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,660
就算沒有這件衣服
that your daddy already sees you that way

744
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,920
你也一直是爸爸的公主  你不需要它
without the shirt, okay? You don't need it.

745
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:40,140
謝謝爸爸  不過我還是要穿著它
Thanks, Daddy, but I'm gonna wear it anyway.

746
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:45,810
好啦
Okay.

747
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,160
公主陛下
Your Highness.

748
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,980
我來給你找個皇冠
Need to find you a crown.

749
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,280
老天  這不可能
Oh, my God, this is not happening.

750
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,160
這事...  你真的...
This is-- are you-- oh.

751
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,570
托比
Toby.

752
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,980
你是在告訴我
So you're telling me

753
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,800
你要為我前妻打工嗎
that you work for my ex-wife?

754
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,950
我原來沒這個打算  只是順其自然而已
I didn't mean to, okay? It just happened.

755
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,380
我只是想近距離看看她
Like, I-I wanted to see her up close.

756
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:20,100
所以你...  就像個連環殺手一樣跟蹤她
So you... just stalked her like a serial killer.

757
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,240
喬茜和我更願意稱之為"做功課"
Josie and I prefer to call it "research."

758
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,160
"喬茜和我"
"Josie and I."

759
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,480
"喬茜和我"
"Josie and I"?

760
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,910
怎麼又來了個"喬茜和我"
Wha-- how in the hell is there a Josie and I?

761
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:27,750
我也不知道
I don't know.

762
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,340
-我只是想知道  -想知道什麼
- I just had to know. - Know what?

763
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,810
托比  這事對我來說比較特殊
Toby, one of these things is not like the other, okay?

764
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,080
我想知道  她是不是從很胖減肥成這樣的
So I wondered, like was she fat and then she got skinny?

765
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,230
她是不是個討厭的人  可答案都是"不"
Was she a terrible person? But no.

766
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,210
她是那麼美貌  出類拔萃
She's actually beautiful, and she's great,

767
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,360
她還誇我很棒
and she thinks that I'm great,

768
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,530
她給店媔i的貨也很有品味
and she has amazing taste in imported goods.

769
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,230
摸摸這個
Like, feel this.

770
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,350
我根本不知道這是啥東西
I don't even know what that is!

771
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,600
是個公文包
It's a portfolio.

772
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,800
我很喜歡
And I liked it.

773
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,570
那種是你喜歡的類型嗎
Is that what you want?

774
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,530
是你喜歡的嗎  你是不是喜歡身材窈窕的人
Is that what you want? Do you want a skinny person?

775
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:57,150
不是  不過我喜歡和正常人在一起  凱特
No, but I would like to be with a sane person, Kate.

776
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,620
這話可不好聽
That is not nice.

777
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,330
好吧  也許我已經對說好話厭倦了
Yeah, well, maybe I'm a little tired of being nice.

778
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,380
有個陌生人說你很棒  你就信了
Some stranger tells you that you're great and you believe her.

779
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,770
可是我說你很棒  你就覺得我在騙你
I tell you you're great and you think I'm lying.

780
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,510
到底為什麼
Why is that?

781
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,580
我不...  我不知道  我有問題
I don't... I don't know. I have a problem.

782
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,030
我們都有一堆問題  凱特
We all have problems, Kate.

783
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,220
托比  我的一生...
Toby, all of my life...

784
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,760
你一直很胖
You've been fat.

785
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,440
我知道
Yeah, I get it.

786
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,060
我很理解你
I empathize, clearly.

787
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,260
我理解你  所以逗你開心
I empathize, then I say something cute,

788
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,730
你高興起來  然後又消沉  如此反覆
then you feel better, rinse and repeat.

789
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,890
她對我很糟糕  凱特
She was terrible to me, Kate.

790
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:34,020
喬茜  這個身材窈窕又成功的女人
Josie, this skinny, successful woman

791
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,500
你真的那麼崇拜她嗎
that-that you admire so much?

792
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
她出軌了  她騙了我
She cheated on me, she lied to me,

793
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,710
然後拿走了我一半的積蓄
and then she took half my life savings.

794
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,760
她離開我一年後
I gained 95 pounds

795
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,870
我體重一下長了近九十斤
in one year after she left me.

796
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,290
在我最低谷的時候  我跟我弟弟說
At my lowest point, I told my brother

797
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,940
我要自殺  當然那不是真的
that I was committing suicide even though that wasn't true

798
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,340
我只是想讓他和我一樣感到恐懼和孤獨
because I wanted him to be as scared and lonely as I was.

799
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,100
你知道嗎  你知道嗎  其實...
You know what? You know what? That's...

800
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,800
我沒說實話  我...
That's a lie, I, uh...

801
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,790
我確實想過自殺
I did consider suicide.

802
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,180
很多次
A lot.

803
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,300
那時候我以酒澆愁
When I would get drunk,

804
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,630
形單影隻
alone,

805
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,350
連自己都厭惡自己
and disgust myself.

806
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,600
所以  面臨問題的並不只有你一個  凱特
So, you haven't cornered the market on problems, Kate.

807
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,580
天啊  我實在很抱歉
God, I'm really sorry.

808
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,000
我的煩惱不會一夜之間煙消雲散  托比
My issues are not gonna go away overnight, Toby.

809
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,060
好吧
Well...

810
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:39,930
我也不會
neither am I.

811
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,510
不過  凱特...
But Jesus, Kate...

812
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,110
喬茜和我
Josie and I

813
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,110
以前相處並不愉快
weren't good together.

814
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,530
今後也不會
So we're not.

815
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,900
不管怎樣  我還是要去她那堨握u
It's not like I was gonna keep the job anyway.

816
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,720
但你知道誰和誰相處很愉快嗎
But you know who are good together?

817
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,370
馬特·勞厄爾和薩維納·格思
Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie?

818
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,370
{\an8}《今日秀》節目的主持人搭檔

819
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,400
我愛他們倆
I love them.

820
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,210
我希望他們成為我的家人
And I want them to be my family.

821
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,740
還有我們倆
And also us.

822
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,990
我們在一起相處也特別愉快
We're pretty good together.

823
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,430
但我主要在說馬特·勞厄爾和薩維納·格思
But mostly I was talking about Matt and Savannah.

824
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,970
我能留著這個公文包嗎
Can I keep the portfolio?

825
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,950
天啊  真要命
Oh, my God, you're killing me.

826
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:29,860
不行
No.

827
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,770
你就不想摸一下嗎
Do you just want to feel it?

828
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,010
天啊
Oh, my God.

829
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,580
這是什麼啊
What is that?

830
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,530
是小寶寶什麼的嗎
That's a baby something.

831
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,510
請給凱特留言
Leave a message for Kate.

832
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,200
是我
Hey, hey, it's me.

833
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,440
我拿下那個角色了
I got the part.

834
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,940
算是...  很棒吧
Yay, right? I think.

835
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,600
能給我回電嗎  就是...
Can you call me? Uh, it's just, you know,

836
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,780
一般都是你告訴我有多棒
you're-you're usually the one who... who tells me how great I am,

837
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,670
而你不在我身邊
and you're not here.

838
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,120
所以...
So...

839
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,450
天  苔絲今晚演的白雪公主不一般啊
Man, that Tess was some Snow White tonight, huh?

840
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,380
是啊
Yeah.

841
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,900
我好像冒犯到你了
I've offended you somehow.

842
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,860
-沒有  -不  我有
- No. - No, I have.

843
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,320
-你覺得我是在評判你  -我...
- You think I'm judging you. - I...

844
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:45,980
因為我沒資格對你品頭論足
Because I'm in no position to judge you whatsoever.

845
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,720
但是你要知道
But you need to know,

846
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,010
如果我有資格評判你
if I was in a position to judge you,

847
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,490
那也是很高的評價
you'd be getting a very high score.

848
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,280
那段在匹茲堡幫黑人兒童上學的經歷
That story you told about helping to bus little black kids in Pittsburgh.

849
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:59,090
-86年  87年的事嗎  -差不多吧
- That was '86, '87? - Thereabout.

850
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,200
你那時沒吸毒
So you were clean then?

851
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,020
還能正常生活
Just... functional?

852
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,960
你知道我這個黑人小孩那時的情況嗎
Because you know what this little black kid was doing?

853
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,590
-我不...  -我是個孩子
- I don't... - I was a little boy,

854
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,280
住在賓州的伯特利公園
living in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.

855
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,540
那邊生活的大多是白人
Which is pretty much the whitest place on Earth.

856
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,230
我有個小本本
I had this little notebook...

857
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,450
每次我新認識一個黑人
and every time I met a new black person,

858
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:23,040
就在那個小本本上標記一下
I would put a mark in this notebook.

859
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,810
每次遇見一個黑人男子  我就心想
And every time I met a black man, I wondered if, somehow,

860
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:32,200
這個男人有沒有可能是我父親
if that man could possibly be my father.

861
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,820
但我不能說
But I couldn't say that.

862
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,200
不能說出來
You know, I couldn't say it out loud

863
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,740
因為我愛我父親
because I loved my father.

864
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,620
我的白人父親
My white father.

865
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,880
還有我的白人母親
And my white mother.

866
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:54,750
我是個內心強大  事業有成的黑人
I'm a strong, successful, black man.

867
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,380
我和我妻子在育兒方面
My wife and I give a lot of thought

868
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,020
-真的花了很多心思  -我信
- to how we raise our girls, believe that. - Yes.

869
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,370
我女兒不覺得自己演白雪公主
The fact that my daughter doesn't find anything unusual

870
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,930
有何不妥
about her playing Snow White?

871
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,630
就體現了這個教育理念
That's the whole idea.

872
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,320
對吧
Right?

873
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,370
我並非無所不知  威廉
Look, I-I don't know everything, William.

874
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,220
不是
I don't.

875
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,670
但我對我的父母很滿意
But I wouldn't change a thing about my parents,

876
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,730
對育兒方式也滿意
or the way that I parent,

877
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,230
-我不會為此道歉  -你也不該
- and I will not apologize for any of it. - You shouldn't.

878
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,960
-因為我不覺得抱歉  -我該道歉
- Because I don't. - I should.

879
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,780
我認識你三個星期了
Three weeks I've known you,

880
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,560
我還沒跟你說那句話
and I still haven't said the words.

881
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,320
-你不必說什...  -對不起
- You don't have to say any... - I'm sorry.

882
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,190
我非常抱歉
I am so deeply sorry.

883
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:42,070
我做了對不起你的事
I did everything wrong by you.

884
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,360
而你每件事都做得很對
And you've done everything right.

885
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,700
樣樣事做得都很好  兒子
You are doing everything right, son.

886
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,200
那麼
Well, uh...

887
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,900
你明早散步時  想穿什麼就穿什麼
Now, you wear whatever you want on your walk tomorrow.

888
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,190
我還挺喜歡這條新卡其褲的
Oh, I like my new flat front khakis just fine.

889
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:24,490
-寶貝說啥喲  -凱文叔叔
- Baby say what? - Uncle Kevin!

890
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,370
-你好嗎  -很好
- How are you? - Good.

891
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,440
-你怎麼樣  -很好  你呢
- How you doing? - I'm good, how are you?

892
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,210
-你真漂亮啊  -謝謝
- Oh, you look beautiful. - Thank you.

893
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:30,850
親愛的  瞧  凱文來了
Honey, look, it's Kevin.

894
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,310
-你好啊  弟弟  -你好

- What's going on, man? - Oh, you know.

896
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,270
想念我的小粉絲們
Missing my fan club, of course, you know?

897
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,200
你不介意我暫住一下吧
And, uh, you don't mind if I crash for a bit, right?

898
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:41,920
-當然行了  -就一段時間

- Yeah? - You should come see the video, and

902
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,570
我們要給史黛西·克萊恩打電話
we have to call Stacy Klein,

903
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,010
她不相信你是我叔叔
who doesn't believe you're my uncle.

904
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:49,900
不是吧  搞什麼啊
You're kidding me, that's ridiculous.

905
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,160
好  我馬上就過去
All right, yeah, I'll be right there.

906
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,220
我們跟她打聲招呼
We'll tell her what's up.

907

這是我生父
This is my biological father.

911
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,250
我尋找生父了  找到了
Whom I looked for, and I found,

912
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,220
就是他了
and this is him.

913
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,850
這事得跟我好好聊聊啊
Uh, well, that probably is gonna be a longer conversation,

914
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,490
但很高興認識你

It's a pleasure to meet you.

All right, where's my little Annie, huh?

920
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,440
我想念另一個小粉絲啊
I miss the other half of my fan club.

921
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,560
他是電視上那個"奶爸"嗎
Was that the Man-ny?

922
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,140
-是啊  -是啊

I'm gonna go get my autograph book.

925
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,710
這時候說想再要一個孩子是不是不合適
Hey, is now a bad time to mention having another kid?

926
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,420
你在看書嗎
Are you reading?

927
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,770
我快看完了  讓我看完吧  親愛的
