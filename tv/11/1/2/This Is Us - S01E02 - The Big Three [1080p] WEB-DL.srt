You hear that, babe?

something, but...               

90
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,812
I'm not sure how to say it.     

91
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:36,014
         Since when do we censor
      ourselves with each other?

92
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,716
No, I know, it's...             

93
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,385
      You know, Beth, we've been
          together for 17 years.

94
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,387
                   That's almost
                 half our lives.

95
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,489
               I know your face,

96
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:47,259
           your hands, your soul

      better than I know my own.

98
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,763
                  You don't have
             to censor yourself.

99
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,699
              Ever. Not with me.

100
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:55,400
         What was your question?

101
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,937
How long is your crack-addict   
biological daddy                

102
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,273
gonna be sleeping in our        
six-year-old daughter's bedroom?

103
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,276
                    Damn.       
I know, right?                  

104
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:05,577
  You need to censor yourself,  
             woman.             

105
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,246
It's just got real.

00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,683
But Randall, he's been here     
for three days.                 

108
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:14,586
And the girls still think       
he's your 70-year-old co-worker 

109
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,788
who likes sleepovers.           

110
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,857
                       (exhales)
    What's our endgame here?    

111
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,527
       Beth, the man has        
    Stage 4 stomach cancer.     

112
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,464
 I'm just trying to get him to  
his first doctor's appointment, 

113
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:27,399
      make sure he's gonna      
     make it past Thursday.     

114
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:30,402
                Then we can take
            the rest from there.

115
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,604
                           Okay?

116
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,872
             Yeah.              

117
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,274
             Okay.              

118
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,949
               And he's a <i>former</i>
       <i>crack addict, by the way.</i>

119
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,951
Oh, well, then                  
he can stay forever.            

120
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,986
            See? You didn't even
               think about that.
(giggling)                      

121
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,491
              �                 
 So now Rebecca's all worked up 

122
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:53,959
   because the kids at school   

123
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,428
   are calling him "Webster."   

124
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,896
You know, the black kid         

125
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,298
the white family                
adopts on that show?            

126
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,999
               I love that show.
Yeah.                           

127
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,103
         I don't know.          

128
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,072
     I don't know, Miguel,      
          it's just...          

129
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:10,642
   It's hard to see the woman   
 I married sometimes, you know? 

130
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,711
              �                 

131
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,819
             What?              

132
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,988
                  Nothing.      
Nothing.                        

133
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,489
        Nothing. You...         
I'm your, I'm your best friend. 

134
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,158
        You're venting.         

135
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,960
 Best friends let best friends  
     vent without judgment.     

136
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,296
I'm not even gonna say anything 
      about it being 5:03       

137
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:32,964
         and that being         
      your second bourbon.      

138
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,499
I appreciate that.              

139
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,835
        The thing is...         

140
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,338
      your wife is, like,       
  the gold standard of wives.   

141
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,473
        I know, Miguel.         
            I mean, she's smart,

142
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:44,109
       funny, beautiful,        

143
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,712
       great personality,       
         greater ass...         
Easy.                           

144
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:50,182
She's raising not one, not two, 
   but three eight-year-olds    

145
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,118
       while you sit here       
   drinking not one, not two,   

146
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,154
 but soon to be three bourbons  
            by 5:05.            

147
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:57,522
    I know all this, Miguel.    

148
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,358
                           Yeah?
            Yeah.               

149
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,159
        Because as your         
       loyal best friend,       

150
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,694
  it is my duty to remind you   

151
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,962
                  of what you've
                      got there.

152
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,530
                You married way,

153
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,700
     <i>way</i> above your station.    

154
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,404
 I'd be careful not to give her 
      a reason to notice.       

155
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,809
Oh, my father, he wasn't        
a very nice man.                

156
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,211
He wasn't like your father.     

157
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,479
                        Why not?

158
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:23,648
Well, your father,              
he's good.                      

159
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,183
He doesn't have vices.          

160
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,752
You know what a vice is?        

161
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,888
  A vice is like a bad habit,   

162
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,324
    like bitin' your nails,     
           but worse.           

163
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,493
    Like drugs?                 
Yeah, that's right.             

164
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,328
       That was my vice.        

165
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,896
Where would you get drugs?      

166
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,365
Well, that's an interesting     
question, Tess.                 

167
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,534
Let's see...                    

168
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,836
Well, the cocaine               
I used to...                    
                    That's good.
Okay, kids.                     

169
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:45,837
                 Let's get ready
               for school, okay?

170
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,072
            Come on.            

171
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,840
                   Hey, so I got
                      good news.

172
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,275
    I got you an appointment    

173
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:51,910
     with an immunotherapy      
          specialist.           

174
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,045
   Oh, that's not necessary.    
             No, it was nothing.

175
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,781
   Guy at my firm had an in.    

176
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:58,350
     This guy is doing some     
 really ground-breaking stuff.  

177
00:06:58,352 --> 00:06:59,751
  Thank you; that's very kind.  

178
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,420
                     You got it.

179
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,555
    Oh, hey, come on, baby.     

180
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,557
  I need you to take one big,   
   deep breath for me, okay?    

181
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,526
           (inhales)            

182
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:08,894
Oh, that's good.                

183
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,595
All right.                      

184
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,130
My vice is asthma.              

185
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:13,131
       (Randall chuckles)       

186
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,566
        His is cocaine.         

187
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:15,867
           All right,           
   so let's get our jackets.    

188
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,369
       Okay.                    
     Go and get your coat.      

189
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:19,438
                           BETH:
                    Honey, here,
          take your lunch. Okay.

190
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,107
    (exhales)                   
          Here you go.          

191
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,642
                 Hey, I'm sorry.

192
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,143
        I know they're too young
          to talk about cocaine.

193
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,611
                     I just...  

194
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,380
I feel like six is a hair young 
         for cocaine...         

195
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:30,315
Yeah, but seven...              
We let them try it at seven.    

196
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,250
(chuckles)                      
BETH: Um, so...                 

197
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,819
              what are you up to
                 today, William?

198
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:36,788
       Oh, nothing much.        
           The usual.           

199
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,592
I've really enjoyed being here. 

200
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:43,462
   Being around those girls--   
    it fills me in a way...     

201
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:46,164
In a way I surely               
don't deserve, so...            

202
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,767
   I hope you'll let me know    
when I've overstayed my welcome.

203
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,168
You know,                       
don't be silly.                 

204
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,571
        We're happy to have you.

205
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,973
             Uh...              

206
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,142
        I was wondering         
    if I could be so forward    

207
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,978
as to ask you for a few dollars 
          for the bus.          

208
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,481
                 Oh, sure. Sure.

209
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,786
        Where you going?        

210
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,255
Oh, you know,                   
just around.                    

211
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,659
            (sighs)             

212
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,032
   � Now because I'm so fly,    
  they just get to know why �   

213
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,535
     � Got to stick to what     
 I do best, I'm like "Oh, hi" � 

214
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:26,538
   � We've been trying to do    
soft tens with aloha, aloha... �

215
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,040
            (sighs)             

216
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,377
        Victor. My man.         

217
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:33,712
         How you been?          

218
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,881
I've been Hector.               
                 Right on. Yeah.

219
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:37,649
            Yeah, and I'm sorry.
         I got a lot on my mind.

220
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,818
       I don't know if you heard
      the news. I left the show.

221
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,653
            Yeah. I'm gonna meet
            with the team today.

222
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,855
           You know, we're gonna
    strategize, talk next steps.

223
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,690
             Lots to figure out,
             lots to talk about.

224
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,293
   It's exciting. Exciting times
          for everyone involved.

225
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,462
(phone ringing in the distance) 

226
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,699
LANIE:                          
Kevin,                          

227
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,801
           do you remember where
      you were when I found you?

228
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,337
     Yeah, sure. I was, uh,     
  in an improv comedy troupe.   

229
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,705
                   That's right.

230
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,008
And when I saw your first show, 

231
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,310
   do you know what I thought   
       to myself, Kevin?        

232
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,846
           No, I-I...           
                       I thought

233
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,749
   to myself... I've done it.   

234
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,517
                    I have found

235
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,254
     the least funny person     
     on the entire planet.      

236
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,689
             Okay.              

237
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,925
                       But I saw
                something there,

238
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,893
       so I took you on.        

239
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,895
 And I got you the commercials, 

240
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,196
              got you the soaps,

241
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,365
eventually got you              
a job paying you                

242
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,834
  almost three million dollars  
            a year,             

243
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:33,772
      making you so famous      
 that you could wear a ski cap  

244
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,907
 when it is 80 degrees outside, 

245
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,243
      and no one would say      
         a damn thing.          

246
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,678
         Okay, Lanie...         

247
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,246
       Take off that hat.       

248
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,250
             Okay.              

249
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,552
  What's done is done, right?   

250
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:50,021
       I mean, you know,        
        can't we just...        

251
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,190
            move on?            

252
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,626
        Brian... speak.         

253
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,297
   You're contractually bound to
 the show for another two years.

254
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,099
             Okay.              

255
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,468
  All right, and if I refuse?   

256
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,608
               Listen to me very
               carefully, Kevin.

257
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,610
           The network owns you.

258
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,545
   They can sue you for damages.

259
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,046
        They could bankrupt you.

260
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,115
             And even if someone
            slipped a chill pill

261
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,650
    into their collective drink,

262
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,885
              you would still be
          legally unable to work

263
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,555
         for the next two years.

264
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:26,591
                  That's for any
            studio, any network.

265
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,560
             Television or film.

266
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:30,962
             So...              

267
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,898
     that's the good news.      

268
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,368
      Now here's the part       
     you're not gonna like.     

269
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,405
             KEVIN:             
    <i>She's throwing this big...</i>  

270
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:41,940
Hollywood party                 
at her house tonight, right?    

271
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,808
The network president's         
gonna be there, everyone.       

272
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,177
I'm supposed to show up,        
get down on my hands and knees  

273
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,612
and beg to be the Manny again.  

274
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,581
        Yeah.                   

275
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,150
They own me, Sis.               

276
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,485
I don't know what I'm gonna do. 

277
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:56,488
                 Well, I do, and
             you did it already.

278
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,657
      Do you need me to show you
           the video on YouTube?

279
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,492
        No.                     

280
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:04,929
           Kevin, I've known you
                your whole life.

281
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:08,800
      Well, except for those two
       minutes at the beginning.

282
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,870
               You've succeed at
   everything you've ever tried.

283
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,005
                So here's what's
                   gonna happen.

284
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,708
              Okay? You're gonna
               go to that party,

285
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,643
       and you're gonna march up
            to that network guy,

286
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,146
                and you're gonna
          tell him, "Manny out!"

287
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:22,814
                         Mm-hmm.
    Manny out?                  

288
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:24,449
Manny out. Manny out!           

289
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,985
       Well, you're not supposed
             to say the... Okay.

290
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:29,521
Manny out!                      
That's good.                    

291
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,657
        (both laughing)         

292
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,626
Let me ask you                  
a question.                     
                    Mm.         

293
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:37,996
What did I ever do those first  
two minutes without you?        

294
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,899
              Oh, you cried, and
              you crapped a lot.

295
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:44,736
                 (muffled laugh)
Sounds about right. Yeah.       

296
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,871
So you're coming to the party,  
though, tonight with me, right? 

297
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,807
      The fancy Hollywood party?
Yeah. Yeah.                     

298
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,208
                    No, I'm not.
Yeah.                           

299
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,910
          Kevin, I... Okay, f...

300
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,878
               I don't even have
               anything to wear.
Kate.                           

301
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,650
I need you there, okay?         

302
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,652
It's gonna be fun.              

303
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:02,320
                Is it? Is-is...?
It's gonna be a blast.          

304
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:03,822
              Yes, it's gonna be
             a blast. Manny out.

305
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,523
  Kevin, here... here's the...  
                      Manny out.

306
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,925
Or maybe Manny <i>out!</i>             

307
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,660
Whatever... whatever works.     

308

But water, scarce though it is, 
    has also, like the wind,

    shaped the land itself.

      Nothing can live...       
        (Randall sighs)         

312
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,680
All right, little mamas,        
five-minute warning             

313
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:30,081
till teeth brushing.            
                          But...

314
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,917
It's not open                   
for discussion.                 

315
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,286
   Rain, the source of all...   

316
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,021
                    Hey, William
                William!        

317
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,556
         Hi, everybody.         

318
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,058
       You're home late.        

319
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,093
        Everything okay?        

320
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,229
      Yeah, yes. I'm fine.      

321
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,397
        Just a long day.        

322
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,633
     I think I may just go      
        lay myself down         

323
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,101
for the night.                  

324
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,737
         Well... night.         

325
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:53,972
        Night.

      From the ashes rises      
         the phoenix...         

327
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,745
  Okay, monsters, these teeth   
 aren't gonna brush themselves.

Oh, God. Hey, girl,             
what you been eating?           
    Ice cream.                  

330
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:07,552
          You scream?           
        I'm gonna scream        

331
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:09,988
     if I got to carry you      
        up these stairs.

Stop. Stop. You don't...

 Well, okay, fine, keep going.

               I'm-I'm so happy.
                 I'm... (laughs)

341
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:35,346
Well, I had a crap day at work, 
    so I stopped at Wendy's.    

342
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,682
        And I was about         
       to eat in the car,       

343
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,651
    which is... all you know    
          is my thing.          

344
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:43,288
The second I left               
the drive-through, I threw      

345
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,825
ten dollars' worth of Wendy's   
out of my moving car,           

346
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,960
        and I went home,        
       and I had a salad.       

347
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,762
(laughs)                        

348
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:53,798
WOMAN:                          
I know I'm ridiculous.          
I know                          

349
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,834
    I'm a joke to you guys.     

350
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,836
       I know I have body       

351
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,438
       distortion issues        
    or whatever it's called,    

352
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,273
         but it's real.         

353
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,675
It's brutal.                    

354
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,310
I wish I could                  
show you guys                   

355
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,378
what I see when I look          
in the mirror...                

356
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,047
             Oh, for God's sake.

357
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:12,183
  Madison, you weigh 105 pounds.

358
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,985
     If you feel like a fat girl
    when you look in the mirror,

359
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,954
                   why don't you
              step a damn scale?

360
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:18,656
        And when the scale reads
              "One, zero, five,"

361
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:19,958
   you know that you're not fat.

362
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,025
                  And Laurie,   

363
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,561
that Wendy's story, okay.       

364
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,029
                  I'm sorry, but
         you're just a litterer.

365
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,398
         You're just a littering
                  damn litterer.

366
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,070
        Uh...                   

367
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:34,806
     well, that feels like      
   a good place for a break.    

368
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:37,275
      (indistinct chatter)      

369
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,918
You hulked out                  
on a bunch of fatties.          

370
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,821
             You're not going to
            make me laugh, Toby.

371
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:52,457
What's up, kid?                 

372
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:58,930
 My brother is making me go to  
 this nightmare Hollywood party 

373
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,499
   at his agent's house tonight.
    Yeah, I went to buy a dress,

374
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,568
        and nothing fit,        
       literally nothing.       

375
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,370
   Everything looks terrible.   

376
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:06,604
     I'm not losing weight.     

377
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,373
I'm starving.                   

378
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,241
I don't know.                   

379
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,611
That's what's up, I guess.      

380
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,580
        Okay.                   

381
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,883
  Hey, your brother's agent is  
      Lanie Shultz, right?      

382
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,518
             Yeah.              

383
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,288
       Kate, Lanie Shultz       

384
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,556
       is one of the most       
        powerful agents         

385
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,393
   in what I like to call...    
         show business.         

386
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:29,928
I heard                         

387
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,430
  that <i>Deadpool</i> was her idea.   

388
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,898
   Or maybe it was <i>Hamilton.</i>    

389
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,600
I get those two confused.       
Anyway,                         

390
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:39,804
   Kate, you are so taking me   
         to that party.         

391
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,239
             Uh-uh.             
Mm-hmm.                         

392
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,041
      No. I don't want you      
        to see me there.        

393
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,909
     Like, I am at my worst     
        at those things.        

394
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,612
Kate, you are                   
at your worst                   

395
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,381
when you are eviscerating       
the anorexic lady,              

396
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,817
and I am still                  
standing here.                  

397
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,619
                         (sighs)
Look,                           

398
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,056
   we have had three lunches    
     and four dinner dates.     

399
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:01,926
  We have made out seven times  
    and heavy-petted twice.     

400
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:04,295
Our plane is rapidly approaching

401
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,830
 the boyfriend-girlfriend zone, 

402
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:08,266
        and, I, for one,        
am preparing myself for landing.

403
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:09,767
       But I need to know       
        that everything         

404
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,836
     isn't gonna always be      
       about our weight.        

405
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,138
        All right? We need to be
   able to cut loose at parties.

406
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,741
   We need to get really dressed
        up, we need to have sex.

407
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,743
  I just slipped that in there  
         very casually          

408
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,144
because I think that's something

409
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,779
   that we should start doing   
           very soon.           

410
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:25,249
So, Kate, I am asking you,      
please, for the love of God,    

411
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,919
can we spend one fat-free night 

412
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,288
    at the house of the lady    
   who came up with the idea    

413
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,990
 for <i>Deadpool</i> and/or <i>Hamilton?</i>  

414
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,927
Is that a...                    
is that a smile?                

415
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:38,696
              (laughs)          
Is that...?                     
Yes, that's a yes and a smile.  

416
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:41,866
           All right, hey, guys,
            Bruce Banner's back.

417
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,935
Everything's fine.              
The Hulk is gone.               

418
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:46,404
   Let the healing continue.    
       Sorry about that.        

419
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,345
Are you comfy?                  

420
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,180
        Okay, sweetness.        

421
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,782
          Good night.           
      I love you so much.       

422
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,351
        I love you, too.        

423
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,853
              Mom?              

424
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,322
          Yeah, babe?           

425
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,958
    I only ate fruit today.     

426
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,427
            (sighs)             

427
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,900
    You know I just want you    
     to be healthy, right?      

428
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:18,369
  And I want you to be happy.   

429
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,738
         Are you happy?         

430
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,573
For the most part.              

431
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,611
     Well, then, I'm happy, too.

432
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,680
    Tell you what. How about    

433
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,749
you and I find a healthy balance
           together?            

434
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,518
            How does that sound?

435
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,319
                      All right.
               RANDALL: Shut up!

436
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,854
    KEVIN: You shut up, Webster.
 RANDALL: Stop calling me names!

437
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:39,323
           Goodnight.           
             Boys?              

438
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,159
Uh-uh.                          
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!        

439
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:42,393
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 

440
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,529
           No, stop.            
    To your beds right now.     

441
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,931
          (boys groan)          
              Now.              

442
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,733
Okay, who am I yelling at first?

443
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,104
            (sighs)             

444
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,505
Kev, bud, what is the deal?     

445
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,240
Why are you always              
so hard on him?                 

446
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,143
           Everybody thinks it's
      weird that we're brothers.

447
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,848
You know it doesn't matter      
what people think.              

448
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,283
He is your little brother,      
Kevin.                          

449
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:06,918
You have to be there            
for one another.                

450
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,186
Do you hear me?                 

451
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:09,921
                  (sighs)       

452
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,422
                    Yes.        

453
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,093
          I love you.           

454
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,201
            (sighs)             

455
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,937
      Can you force him be nice?

456
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,739
    I'll see what I can do.     

457
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,608
Hey.                            

458
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,944
       Promise me you'll        
        always be good.         

459
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,314
         I'll see what I can do.

460
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,815
         (soft chuckle)         

461
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,619
I love you.                     

462
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,421
  Now get some sleep, please.   

463
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:44,922
       No more fighting.        

464
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,458
Don't make me come back in here.

465
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,260
    Good night, I love you.     

466
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,896
            (sighs)             

467
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,311
           Hi, baby.            

468
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,881
       Hi, baby.                

469
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,484
 Did I miss putting them down?  

470
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,887
Just by an hour.                

471
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,525
         Well, I was...         

472
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,860
     I was-- oh, shopping.      

473
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,529
        I was shopping.         

474
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,134
           I know...            

475
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:31,802
        (clears throat)         

476
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:35,940
          I know we haven't been
        on the same page lately.

477
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:39,610
             That we just got to
        get back on track, baby.

478
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,113
             So...              

479
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:45,683
       consider this a...       
       way-too-expensive        

480
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,185
                 peace offering.

481
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,887
I think we've been              
more than off track.            

482
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:59,297
Hey, how do you think           
we're doing so far?             

483
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,998
At parenting?                   

484
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,168
                            I...
'Cause I think we're at a six.  

485
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,071
On a sliding scale,             
one through ten,                

486
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:10,641
I think we're at a six          
and I think I'm being generous. 

487
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:13,511
                          Bec...
Seven, fine,                    

488
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,913
but only because                
there are three of them.        

489
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,715
                      Baby, I...
And the thing is,               

490
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:21,252
I'm trying really hard          
to get us to a nine.            

491
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:24,188
Because they are cute kids,     
and they deserve nine-parents.  

492
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:29,093
And, the thing is,              
I feel like I'm there, Jack.    

493
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:34,332
I feel like                     
I'm operating at a nine.        

494
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:38,703
Because I do                    
individualized lunches          

495
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:41,038
and I do individualized tuck-ins
for each kid                    

496
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,773
so nobody feels gypped.         

497
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,342
     And...                     

498
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:45,643
    (scoffs)                    

499
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:53,017
When you're home,               
and you're you,                 

500
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:56,053
you're way better than I am.    

501
00:20:56,055 --> 00:21:00,558
You're a ten when               
you're you, Jack.               

502
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,594
But you're getting home         
later and later                 

503
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,429
and when you do come home,      
you're...                       
Bec, what are you saying?       

504
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,331
The drinking has to stop.       

505
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,036
You have to reign it in, baby,  

506
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:15,306
because I won't have it         
in my house.                    

507
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:19,076
               You won't have it
                  in your house.
    I won't.                    

508
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:21,312
So if it's a problem, fix it.   

509
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:24,282
Be a man, and fix it.           

510
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:27,818
Because I'm done letting you    
lower our score.                

511
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,328
       (knocking on door)       

512
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,234
                     Damn.      

513
00:21:43,236 --> 00:21:45,236
        Yeah?                   
                    (chuckling):
                           Yeah.

514
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:46,737
               Hell to the yeah.

515
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,506
            Thanks.             
                     (chuckling)

516
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:49,774
        You look dapper.        

517
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:51,342
       Ah, show business.       

518
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:52,910
         Oh, great, you're, uh--

519
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,312
         We got to go, you know?

520
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,080
     'Cause we're gonna be late.
Okay.                           

521
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:57,281
      You're wearing that?      

522
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:58,316
                   Yeah.        

523
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,451
         That's great.          

524
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,520
       You look awesome.        
    Oh, is the hat too much?    

525
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:04,121
The hat is everything.          

526
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,357
             Yeah, that's a real
                peacock feather.

527
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,759

        (machine beeps)         

569
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,643
  (treadmill slows to a stop)   
                            Hey.

570
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:06,911
Shower.                         

571
00:24:06,913 --> 00:24:08,245
Sleep.                          

572
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:10,581
Now.                            

573
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,983
You shower quick, you can work  
off that last five minutes      

574
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:14,485
a different way.                

575
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,387
                       (panting)

576
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,562
       I am so happy that       
   we could all get together.   

577
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:26,664
 You know, work through, and... 

578
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,599
       (stammers): and...       
   Kevin just feels awful...    

579
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:32,069
I'm so sorry, this is whole     
thing, Lanie, is ridiculous.    

580
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:34,572
I mean...                       

581
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:37,141
Mr. Manning.                    

582
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,776
I'm truly grateful              
for everything                  

583
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:41,345
that your network               
has done for me, I am.          

584
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:44,148
But please let me               
go with God, sir.               

585
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,417
The way I handled myself,       

586
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:48,853
I mean, that was wrong, I'll be 
the first one to admit that.    

587
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:51,822
That-that was wrong.            

588
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:55,659
But can't we all, at this point,
just, sort of, you know...      

589
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,928
sort of move on, right?         

590
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,633
       You're a good kid, Kevin.

591
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:03,968
      I appreciate your honesty.

592
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,202
Thank you.                      

593
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:07,705
                The show, it's a
                solid performer,

594
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:10,307
                but it's not the
    biggest thing on my network.

595
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,309
       Without Lanie telling me,

596
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:15,312
          would I have known you
       from one of these waiters

597
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:18,015
                  passing around
            the chicken skewers?

598
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,851
                   Probably not.
Really?                         

599
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,953
    I really don't care what    
   happens behind the scenes    

600
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:25,990
   on my third-rated sitcom.    

601
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:27,725
 You know what I do care about? 

602
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:29,326
KEVIN:                          
Mm-mm.                          

603
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:30,794
      St. Maarten, Kevin.       

604
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:34,198
             I'm building a home
                  in St. Maarten

605
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,201
        and in two years        
      I'm going to retire,      

606
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:40,471
   and my favorite wife and I   
    are going to move there.    

607
00:25:40,473 --> 00:25:42,706
                     Until then,

608
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,476
    I plan on just drifting     
    through these two years     

609
00:25:45,478 --> 00:25:49,547
  as painlessly and drama-free  
          as possible.          

610
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,849
  Like I'm on morphine, Kevin,  

611
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:55,886
  that's how I'll be drifting   
      through those years.      

612
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,492
        Okay.                   

613
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:05,262
That's... great, you know?      

614
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:06,764
Go with God.                    

615
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:13,237
        You know, the thing is--
              excuse me darling.
        (Lanie chuckles)        

616
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:17,274
              Recasting the lead
                on a hit sitcom,

617
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:21,545
       isn't exactly drifting on
     morphine, now is it, Kevin?

618
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:24,348
       So unfortunately, my boy,

619
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,384
             you're not gonna be
               leaving the show.

620
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:32,356
    If you do, I'll be forced to
  Nagasaki your life and career.

621
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:36,560
     Hey, have you ever heard of
 the actor, uh, Taylor Jennings?

622
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,028
I'm not familiar with the name. 

623
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,597
               I Nagasaki'd him.

624
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,034
         So take the money, kid.

625
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:47,271
               Ride out the next
        couple years, all right?

626
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,473
        Otherwise, I'll make you
          a bigger laughingstock

627
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:51,475
           than you already are.

628
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:56,313
                      Deal?     

629
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:59,216
I'm sorry, I'm j--              
I'm gonna go, uh...             

630
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:00,451
my sister's here,               

631
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:01,785
I'm gonna go check on her.      

632
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,392
           It's his twin sister.

633
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:09,994
                  Big girl.     

634
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:11,662
    � Yeah, we're all about     
         a good time �          

635
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:12,963
    � Yeah, we're all about     
         a good life �          

636
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,231
         (Toby laughs,          
    glass splashes in pool)     

637
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:15,633
                       (giggles)

638
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:18,268
            You love drunk Kate.
I love drunk Kate.              

639
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,803
                     Wait, what?

640
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,071
                        Woo!    
              Hey.              

641
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:22,306
              Hey!              

642
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,341
                    How'd it go?
                     I'm wasted.

643
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:25,676
           Not good.            

644
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:27,411
                           Good?
       Oh, my God, that's great.

645
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,113
   No, no, no, no, <i>not</i> good.    

646
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:30,581
   It did not-- I don't know    
       what I'm gonna do.       

647
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:32,583
    (imitates fishing reel)     
Uh-oh!                          

648
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:34,451
Gone fishing.                   
           You caught a whopper!

649
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:37,021
Uh-oh.                          
(grunting)                      

650
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:39,256
        Come reel me in,        
       got to reel me in.       

651
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:41,659
(grunts)                        
It's my first time fishing.     

652
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:43,961
Won't be his last.              
            Well...             

653
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:46,163
    � Yeah, we're all about     
         a good time �          

654
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,998
    � Yeah, we're all about     
         a good life. �         
                            Kev!

655
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:56,674
     Which little monster's     
      standing at my door?      

656
00:27:56,676 --> 00:28:00,377
   It's okay, I'm way too old   
   to be scared of monsters.    

657
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:07,384
       I think it's time        
     you and I had a talk.      

658
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,626
   (indistinct conversations)   

659
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,579
        (bus door opens,        
    children chatter, laugh)    

660
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,319
I can't wait until the next day 
of school starts.               

661
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,588
  Hey, everyone, it's Webster!  

662
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,090
(children laughing and taunting)

663
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:51,729
                          BULLY:
                            Kev,

664
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,030
                 come on, Kevin,
                  ditch Webster.

665
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:54,498
                       Let's go.

666
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,101
                        Come on.

667
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,804
       (phone vibrating)        

668
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:07,511
         (phone beeps)          

669
00:29:07,513 --> 00:29:08,746
              Hey.              

670
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:10,080
              Hey.              

671
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,849
   Hey, uh... is it too late    
           out there?           

672
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:13,283
 I know you're usually up late, 
             right?             

673
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:15,452
     No, I was just, uh...      
        (clears throat)         

674
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:17,087
 catching up on some paperwork. 

675
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,756
          Sweet, uh...          

676
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:20,591
     Hey, listen, I-I know      
   I've owed you a phone call   

677
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,192
  since everything went down,   

678
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:23,694
   it's been crazy out here,    
       just... you know.        

679
00:29:23,696 --> 00:29:25,095
       No, it's all good.       

680
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,064
  Kate's kept me up to speed.   

681
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:29,133
             Good.              

682
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,374
  They said they're not gonna   
  let me out of the show, man.  

683
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:39,209
            And I...            

684
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:41,211
I don't know what I'm gonna do, 
            like...             

685
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:43,781
       they locked me in        
for two more years, maybe more. 

686
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:45,716
             Damn.              

687
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:47,117
  Well, what are you gonna do?  

688
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,653
      I was kind of hoping      
         you'd tell me.         

689
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:53,157
      Oh, because you care      
         what I think?          

690
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,959
         Because I care         
   what everyone thinks, man.   

691
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,561
         You know that.         

692
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:03,734
     I was not a very good      
     brother to you, was I?     

693
00:30:03,736 --> 00:30:05,135
        No, you weren't.        

694
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,006
   But you've still got time.   

695
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:11,308
KATE (giggling):                
Hey!                            

696
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,143
                     Yeah, uh...

697
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,345
      Anyway, look, it's getting
       late, man, I, you know...

698
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:16,613
           I probably should go.

699
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:18,248
                     It's, uh...

700
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,850
      Kate's here, it's Randall.

701
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:21,952
            Oh, hey, Randall!   
     Hey.                       

702
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:24,454
         Anyway, yeah,          
   I-I should probably, uh...   

703
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,089
    I got to go back inside     
and sell my soul to the network,

704
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,324
   like the whore that I am.    

705
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,692
           Hey, Kev.            

706
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,497
       Deep breath, okay?       

707
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,836
         Come on, man.          
         First came...          

708
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,605
              Me.               

709
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:43,106
        And Dad said...         

710
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:44,575
             "Gee."             

711
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,279
And then came...                
                        Me!     

712
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:50,514
And Mom said...                 

713
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,149
            "Whee!"             
And then came...                

714
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:53,483
              Me.               
        And they said...        

715
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:54,518
        "That's three."         

716
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,120
Big Three!                      
              ALL:              
           Big Three!           

717
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:59,389
        KATE (laughing):        
             Yeah.              

718
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:07,164
           You good?            

719
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:09,666
          Uh... yeah.           

720
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:12,736
   Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.    

721
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:15,038
             Kevin?             
             Yeah?              

722
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,342
    Mom and Dad didn't raise    
           no whores.           

723
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:21,545
        Except briefly,         
 during Kate's eyeliner phase.  

724
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,747
           (chuckles)           

725
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:26,450
            (sniffs)            
             Yeah.              

726
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:31,855
     Night, little brother.     

727
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:34,558
      Night, big brother.       

728
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:38,762
         (phone beeps)          

729
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,902
              Hon?              

730
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:46,336
                   There you go.
           Thank you.           

731
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:48,171
                         Mm-hmm.

732
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:51,708
    Can I cut to the chase?     

733
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,210
       It's your meeting.       

734
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:55,279
           (chuckles)           

735
00:31:56,948 --> 00:32:00,784
  Eight years ago, I was, um,   
  pregnant for the first time.  

736
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:04,421
     And Randall was vying      
    for partner at his firm.    

737
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:07,524
  We'd just bought this house   
           on faith,            

738
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,960
     even though it needed      
         a lot of work,         

739
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:14,064
    even though we couldn't     
     afford it whatsoever.      

740
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:16,233
   Then Randall made partner.   

741
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:18,702
      He did all the work       
     on the house himself,      

742
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:20,604
       so we didn't have        
       to spend a penny.        

743
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:23,040
        And he made sure        
     I didn't lift a finger     

744
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:24,775
      during my pregnancy.      

745
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:26,043
                He's a good man.

746
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:28,245
       No, he's not good.       

747
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:30,914
         He's perfect.          

748
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:33,550
Problem is, he stopped sleeping.

749
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:36,887
     And then one morning,      
     I was in the bathroom,     

750
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:40,257
    and he called out to me.    

751
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:41,959
 And he was confused, you know? 

752
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,729
 He was confused because he...  

753
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,799
     couldn't see anything.     

754
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:55,639
          My husband--          
     my mountain of a man--     

755
00:32:55,641 --> 00:33:00,644
   could literally no longer    
  see things through his eyes.  

756
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,113
It was as if 28 years           
of being that perfect           

757
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:05,482
had all caught up to him        
that morning.                   

758
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:09,820
         And he, um...          

759
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:12,789
  he pulled himself out of it.  

760
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:16,326
       He self-corrected,       

761
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,395
'cause that's what my man does. 

762
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:25,936
  Randall is not free of vice,  
            William.            

763
00:33:25,938 --> 00:33:29,139
   His vice is his goodness.    

764
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:31,641
It's his compulsive drive       

765
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:34,644
         to be perfect.         

766
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:38,715
     It's why I love him...     

767
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:43,120
  but it's also why I have to   
protect him sometimes, you know?

768
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:46,790
   So now, I'm gonna have to    
  ask you a couple questions,   

769
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:51,962
 questions he would probably be 
   too polite to ask himself.   

770
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,332
           Ask away.            

771
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:57,968
(inhales sharply)               
The money you borrow.           

772
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:00,637
You use it for the bus?         

773
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:02,572
                   Yes.         

774
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:05,475
        Where do you go?        

775
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:09,012
You're gone all day, every day. 

776
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:13,016
   My place in Philadelphia,    
       it's a long ride.        

777
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:14,885
        Why?                    

778
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,486
Are you using drugs?            

779
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:18,388
Are you getting drugs?          
           Mm-mm. No.           

780
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:21,091
      Are you really sick?      

781
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,594
           Yes, I am.           

782
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:30,100
    Beth, I said it before,     
     and I really meant it:     

783
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:32,035
 if I'm overstaying my welcome, 

784
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:33,637
 I wish you would just say it.  

785
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:37,874
William, you are overstaying... 

786
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:39,609
RANDALL:                        
Beth.                           

787
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,244
             What are you doing?

788
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,213
      Somebody has to ask       
  the questions here, baby...   

789
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:45,282
                     It's a cat.

790
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,952
                   I have a cat.

791
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:52,122
It's all I really have.         

792
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:54,858
             His name's Clooney.

793
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:59,229
      One of those ironic names,
  'cause he's a pretty ugly cat.

794
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:01,798
I go back and forth to feed him.

795
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,401
Three hours on the bus each day.

796
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:07,137
           Why wouldn't you just
          tell us you had a cat?

797
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:08,438
              Nah.              

798
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,973
   The little one has asthma    

799
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:11,408
                   and I knew if
           I brought up the cat,

800
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,542
      you'd tell me to bring it,

801
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:13,910
      that would cause problems.

802
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:15,612
                And I don't want
          to cause any problems,

803
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,147
     'cause if I cause problems,
              I'd have to leave.

804
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:18,415
             And...             

805
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:21,218
   and I don't want to leave.   

806
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,754
  Six months ago, some doctor   
  told me I had three to live.  

807
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:27,924
      But for some reason,      
  I don't feel so bad lately.   

808
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:30,427
  Maybe to do with this house.  

809
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:33,063
         I don't know.          

810
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:34,498
  Truth is, I'd never thought   

811
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,099
       I'd have anything        
      to care about again       

812
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:38,368
   besides an ugly cat, so...   

813
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:45,442
 Well, now I feel like a bitch. 

814
00:35:45,444 --> 00:35:46,776
                (Randall laughs)

815
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:47,978
       (William chuckles)       

816
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,079
It's not funny.                 

817
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:50,247
           It's not.            

818
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:51,982
                     (chuckling)
        It's not funny.         

819
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:53,550
      (laughing continues)      

820
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:02,292
        I'm about two hours away
     from throwing up violently.

821
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:03,693
              Mm.               

822
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:05,495
   Are you gonna hold my hair   
         for me, Toby?          

823
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,631
No. I-I'm still gonna be        
at this party,                  

824
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:09,266
trying to bang                  
a Gilmore Girl.                 

825
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:11,034
(laughs)                        

826
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,036
       Well, go for both.       

827
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:15,438
   Gil-more the Gil-merrier.    

828
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:25,448
      It's always gonna be      
 about the weight for me, Toby. 

829
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,051
            (sniffs)            

830
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:30,520
 It's been my story ever since  
      I was a little girl.      

831
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,659
     And every moment that      
   I'm not thinking about it,   

832
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:37,561
     I'm thinking about it.     

833
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:39,329
                         Like...

834
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:41,198
    will this chair hold me?    

835
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,167
    Will this dress fit me?     

836
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:47,337
  And if I ever get pregnant,   
            would...            

837
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:49,606
    will anyone ever notice?    

838
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,080
    It's just at the core of    
who I am, it's just deep inside,

839
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:59,916
and eight tequila shots can only
 mask that for a couple hours.  

840
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:01,818
                           So...
            I know.             

841
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,655
 And it was ten tequila shots,  

842
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:09,392
              but I... I get it.
                         I know.

843
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,396
    And just for the record,    

844
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:18,435
 um, this dress is fitting you  
    in all the right places.    

845
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:19,436
           (purring)            

846
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:21,871
        This old thing?         
                         Uh-huh.

847
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:23,106
 I mean, I-I just threw it on.  

848
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:24,407
       Oh, you just threw it on?
    Mm-hmm.                     

849
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,675
                   I didn't even
                 think about it.

850
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:28,445
           (chuckles)           

851
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:29,946
            (sighs)             

852
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,316
          There he is.          

853
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,887
        I told 'em to go        
       screw themselves.        

854
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:40,257
            And what'd they say?

855
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:43,593
  A lot of mean, scary things.  

856
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,967
     I'm gonna do theater.      

857
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,669
           You know?            

858
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,006
I'm moving                      
to New York.                    

859
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,812
                   (whispering):
                  Show business.

860
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,125
                         (sighs)
  What are you doing out here?  

861
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:21,197
           I don't like sleeping
              far away from you.

862
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:25,735
       No more drinking.        

863
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:26,970
You can't just stop...          

864
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,238
             I can.             

865
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,307
        For you, I can.         

866
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,410
            I will.             

867
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:35,745
                   (sighs)      

868
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:39,582
      You know, when I was      
         a little boy,          

869
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:43,353
  I didn't know what I wanted   
     to be when I grew up.      

870
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,290
       (inhales, exhales deeply)

871
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:51,161
       Adults always ask        
       little kids that.        

872
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,131
           You know?            

873
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:57,701
   I never had a good answer.   

874
00:38:57,703 --> 00:39:00,537
Not until... not until I was 28.

875
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,174
  Till the day that I met you.  

876
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:10,347
 That's when I knew exactly what
  I wanted to be when I grew up:

877
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,784
     I wanted to be the man     
      that made you happy.      

878
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:19,155
                         (sighs)

879
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:20,857
       You make me happy.       

880
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,792
                     Not always.

881
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:25,628
            (scoffs)            
          Not lately.           

882
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:34,237
 From here on out, I'm gonna be 
      an 11 for you, baby.      

883
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,675
             No...              

884
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:41,344
          Screw that.           

885
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:45,849
   I'm gonna be a 12 for you,   
         from here out.         

886
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:49,185
                   I'll be an 11
                   for the kids,

887
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:50,720
               but you get a 12.

888
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,628
       Do you forgive me?       

889
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:04,300
 You slept outside our bedroom  
     door like a Labrador.      

890
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,772
    Of course I forgive you.    

891
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,913
 Can I still give you my gift?  

892
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,949
         If you insist.         

893
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,961
 � Come down off your throne    

894

 � And leave your body alone    

896

      I got a moon because of...
           Our song.            

897
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,601
             Yeah.

900

        � You are reason        
  I've been waiting so long �

903
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:53,950

           Thank you.

           till the kids get up?

910

I don't care about the kids.
