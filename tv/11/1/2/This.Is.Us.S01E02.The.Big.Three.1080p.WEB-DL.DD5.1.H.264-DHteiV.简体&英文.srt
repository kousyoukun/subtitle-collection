这节目太烂了
This show is so bad!

13
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,780
一切都是假的
Everything's fake!

我愿意相信
I like to think that you took

18

你将生活带给你柠檬般的酸楚
the sourest lemon that life has to offer

19
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,990
酿成犹如柠檬汽水般的甘甜
and turned it into something resembling lemonade.

20
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,680

妈妈  "白家黑"让我闭嘴

25
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,470
别人都这么叫啊
Everyone else always does.

26
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,880
我不管其他人如何

兰德尔是你弟弟  你要给他做主

It's fine. It's fine.

37
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,730
你拿水果了吗
Did you get fruit?

38
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:26,960
拿了
Yes.

39
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,480
要我告诉你咖啡在哪里倒吗
Do you need me to show you where the coffee is?

40
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,740
我知道在哪里
Oh, I know where the coffee is.

00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,270
-行  -给我...

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,470
好
Okay.

44
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,630
爸爸要走了  深呼吸
Dad's off. Deep breaths.

45
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,390
准备...
And...

46
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,140
-最开始...  -是我
- First came... - Me!

47
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,490
-爸爸说...  -天哪
- And Dad said... - Gee!

48
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,540
-然后呢...  -是我
- And then came... - Me!

49
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,830
-妈妈说...  -妈呀
- And Mom said... - Whee!

50
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,480
-最后呢...  -是我
- And then came... - Me.

51
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,270
-我们说...  -三个了
- And we said... - That's three.

52
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,980
-三个小家伙  -三个小家伙
- Big Three? - Big Three!

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,690
要我告诉你我的嘴在哪里吗
Do you need me to show you where my mouth is?

54
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,920
不用
No.

55
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,700
我知道在哪
I know where it is.

56
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,180
行
Good.

57
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,190
-再见  -拜拜
- Bye. - Bye.

58
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,830
凯特  水果都吃掉
Kate, all the fruit, please.

59
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,450
你好呀
What's up?

60
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,400
我练了肱二头肌  肱三头肌  和左边蛋蛋
You know, I just did bi's, tri's and left testicle.

61
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,530
我发现那家伙有不少恶趣味
I'm really starting to get some definition on that guy.

62
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,220
-行了  不好笑  -好笑啊...
- Stop. Not funny. - It's fun...

63
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,750
-不好笑  -行了  能走了吗
- It's not funny. - Come on. Come on, can we go?

64
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,030
我们已经练了很久了
We've been here long enough.

65
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,460
-不  -凯特  来嘛  走吧
- No... - Kate. Come on, Kate... Come on.

66
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,210
为什么你瘦了  而我没有
How are you losing weight and I'm not?

67
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,020
我能说实话吗
Can I be honest with you?

68
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,560
说啊
Yeah, please.

69
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,690
可能是因为我比你认真吧
I think I'm just taking this more seriously than you are.

70
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,190
好啦  走吧
Come on. Let's go.

71
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,460
世上最糟糕的地方
Worst place in the world!

72
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,400
亲爱的
Baby?

73
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,460
怎么
Yeah.

74
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,470
我想问你个事  可...
I want to ask you something, but...

75
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,360
不知该怎么说
I'm not sure how to say it.

76
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,530
从什么时候开始  我们要互相检讨了
Since when do we censor ourselves with each other?

77
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,560
不  不是...
No, I know, it's...

78
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,130
贝丝  我们在一起十七年了
You know, Beth, we've been together for 17 years.

79
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,370
几乎过了半辈子
That's almost half our lives.

80
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,460
我懂你的表情
I know your face,

81
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,620
你的双手  你的心思
your hands, your soul

82
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,230
我对你的了解比对自己还多
better than I know my own.

83
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,870
你不必检讨自己
You don't have to censor yourself.

84
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,710
在我面前  永远不必
Ever. Not with me.

85
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,540
你想问什么
What was your question?

86
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,830
你这位吸毒的亲生父亲
How long is your crack-addict biological daddy

87
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,680
要在咱们六岁的女儿房里住多久
gonna be sleeping in our six-year-old daughter's bedroom?

88
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,300
-我去  -我就说吧
- Damn. - I know, right?

89
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,680
你要检讨一下自己  女人
You need to censor yourself, woman.

90
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,120
被我说中了吧
It's just got real.

91
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,610
可是兰德尔  他已经住了三天
But Randall, he's been here for three days.

92
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,780
女儿们现在还以为他只是你的一位
And the girls still think he's your 70-year-old co-worker

93
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,460
喜欢在别人家过夜的七十岁老同事
who likes sleepovers.

94
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,470
最后我们要怎么办
What's our endgame here?

95
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,030
贝丝  他得了晚期胃癌
Beth, the man has Stage 4 stomach cancer.

96
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,500
我只想带他找医生做个初步检查
I'm just trying to get him to his first doctor's appointment,

97
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,790
确保他能挺过周四
make sure he's gonna make it past Thursday.

98
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,930
其他事到时候我们再说
Then we can take the rest from there.

99
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,720
好吗
Okay?

100
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,490
好  当然可以
Yeah. Okay.

101
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,240
顺便说一句  他是"曾经"吸过毒
And he's a former crack addict, by the way.

102
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,960
那他就住到天长地久吧
Oh, well, then he can stay forever.

103
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,300
瞧见没  你想都不想就这么说
See? You didn't even think about that.

104
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,960
最近丽贝卡很生气
So now Rebecca's all worked up

105
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,020
因为学校的孩子们叫他"白家黑"
because the kids at school are calling him "Webster".

106
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,590
你看过白人家庭
You know, the black kid

107
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,520
收养黑人小孩的那个剧吗
the white family adopts on that show?

108
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,690
我喜欢那个剧
I love that show.

109
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,260
我不明白  米格尔  只是...
I don't know. I don't know, Miguel, it's just...

110
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,030
有时候我觉得看不到原来的她了
It's hard to see the woman I married sometimes, you know?

111
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,320
在想什么
What?

112
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,700
-没什么  -没什么
- Nothing. - Nothing.

113
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,010
真的没什么  你...
Nothing. You...

114
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:24,620
我是你最好的朋友
I'm your, I'm your best friend.

115
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,840
你只是发牢骚而已
You're venting.

116
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,030
好朋友会倾听彼此发泄  不说三道四
Best friends let best friends vent without judgment.

117
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,390
就算刚过五点你已经喝了两杯酒
I'm not even gonna say anything about it being 5:03

118
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,220
我也不会说什么
and that being your second bourbon.

119
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,570
谢谢理解
I appreciate that.

120
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,750
问题是...
The thing is...

121
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,910
你老婆是个标准的好媳妇
your wife is, like, the gold standard of wives.

122
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,560
我知道  米格尔
I know, Miguel.

123
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,040
她聪明  有趣  又很漂亮
I mean, she's smart, funny, beautiful,

124
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,790
-性格好  身材也好...  -悠着点
- great personality, greater ass... - Easy.

125
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,650
她养的不是一个两个
She's raising not one, not two,

126
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,350
而是三个八岁大的孩子
but three eight-year-olds

127
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,270
可你却在这儿一杯接一杯地喝酒
while you sit here drinking not one, not two,

128
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,280
刚过五点第三杯就要下肚
but soon to be three bourbons by 5:05.

129
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,450
这些我都懂  米格尔
I know all this, Miguel.

130
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,670
-你懂吗  -我懂
- Yeah? - Yeah.

131
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,300
因为作为你最忠实的好朋友
Because as your loyal best friend,

132
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,700
我有责任告诉你现在是什么状况
it is my duty to remind you of what you've got there.

133
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,930
娶到她  你是大大的高攀了
You married way, way above your station.

134
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,580
建议你别让她意识到这一点
I'd be careful not to give her a reason to notice.

135
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,800
我老爸不是好人
Oh, my father, he wasn't a very nice man.

136
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,440
他跟你们的爸爸不一样
He wasn't like your father.

137
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,730
为什么
Why not?

138
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,290
你们的爸爸很优秀
Well, your father, he's good.

139
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,480
没有恶习
He doesn't have vices.

140
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,380
你们明白恶习是什么吗
You know what a vice is?

141
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,960
恶习是种坏习惯
A vice is like a bad habit,

142
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,550
比如咬指甲  但是更严重
like bitin' your nails, but worse.

143
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,720
-比如吸毒  -没错  差不多
- Like drugs? - Yeah, that's right.

144
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,210
那是我的恶习
That was my vice.

145
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,980
你从哪弄来毒品的呢
Where would you get drugs?

146
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,290
这是个好问题  苔丝
Well, that's an interesting question, Tess.

147
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,370
让我想想
Let's see...

148
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:43,870
我曾经吸的可卡因...
Well, the cocaine I used to...

149
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,710
-好了  可以了  -好了  孩子们
- OK. That's good. - Okay, kids.

150
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,890
我们得准备上学了
Let's get ready for school, okay?

151
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,950
快点
Come on.

152
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,890
我有个好消息
Hey, so I got good news.

153
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,160
我给你预约了一个免疫疗法的专家
I got you an appointment with an immunotherapy specialist.

154
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,130
-不用麻烦了  -不  这没什么
- Oh, that's not necessary. - No, it was nothing.

155
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,750
我公司的同事有门路
Guy at my firm had an in.

156
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,590
这人做了不少突破性研究
This guy is doing some really ground-breaking stuff.

157
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,100
谢谢  那太好了
Thank you, that's very kind.

158
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,230
应该的
You got it.

159
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,600
来吧  宝贝
Oh, hey, come on, baby.

160
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,970
深吸一口  好吗
I need you to take one big, deep breath for me, okay?

161
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,060
很好
Oh, that's good.

162
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,250
可以了
All right.

163
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,750
我的恶习是哮喘
My vice is asthma.

164
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,860
他的是可卡因
His is cocaine.

165
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,040
好了  把外套带上
All right, so let's get our jackets.

166
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,410
去拿上你的衣服
Go and get your coat.

167
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,150
甜心  拿好你的午饭
Honey, here, take your lunch.

168
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,570
去吧
Here you go.

169
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,530
对不起
Hey, I'm sorry.

170
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,540
我知道现在跟她们说可卡因太早了
I know they're too young to talk about cocaine.

171
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,300
我只是...
I just...

172
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,560
六岁吸可卡因是不是太早了
I feel like six is a hair young for cocaine...

173
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,310
没错  等到了七岁再让她们试试
Yeah, but seven... We let them try it at seven.

174
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,250
今天你去做什么  威廉
Um, so... what are you up to today, William?

175
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,190
没什么事  跟平时一样
Oh, nothing much. The usual.

176
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,000
能待在这里我真的很开心
I've really enjoyed being here.

177
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,910
跟孩子们在一起  让我觉得很满足
Being around those girls-- it fills me in a way...

178
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,090
但我不配过得这么幸福  所以
in a way I surely don't deserve, so...

179
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,990
如果我待太久给你们添麻烦了
I hope you'll let me know

180
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,050
希望你们要及时告诉我
when I've overstayed my welcome.

181
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,030
别说傻话
You know, don't be silly.

182
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,610
我们很高兴你能留下
We're happy to have you.

183
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,950
那我们就不打扰你了
We'll let you get on with your day.

184
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,040
冒昧问一句  我能不能
I was wondering if I could be so forward

185
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,070
问你们要几美元坐公车
as to ask you for a few dollars for the bus.

186
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,040
没事  应该的
Oh, sure. Sure.

187
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,830
你要去哪里
Where you going?

188
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,510
随便转转
Oh, you know, just around.

189
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,050
维克多  我的兄弟
Victor. My man.

190
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:33,890
你还好吗
How you been?

191
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,020
-我是赫克托  -对极了
- I've been Hector. - Right on. Yeah.

192
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,920
对不起  最近事情有点多
Yeah, and I'm sorry. I got a lot on my mind.

193
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,390
不知道你听说了吗  我离开剧组了
I don't know if you heard the news. I left the show.

194
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,530
今天我就是来和团队开会的
Yeah. I'm gonna meet with the team today.

195
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,220
制订接下来的计划
You know, we're gonna strategize, talk next steps.

196
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,550
好多东西需要解决  好多东西要谈
Lots to figure out, lots to talk about.

197
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,260
太激动了
It's exciting.

198
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,150
对所有人来说都是激动人心的时刻
Exciting times for everyone involved.

199
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,960
凯文
Kevin,

200
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,240
你还记得当初我是在哪找到你的吗
do you remember where you were when I found you?

201
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,270
当然  我当时在一个即兴喜剧剧团
Yeah, sure. I was, uh, in an improv comedy troupe.

202
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,190
没错
That's right.

203
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,070
当我看到你的第一场表演
And when I saw your first show,

204
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,580
你知道我想的是什么吗  凯文
do you know what I thought to myself, Kevin?

205
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,940
-不知道  -我想的是  我做到了
- No, I-I... - I thought to myself... I've done it.

206
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,440
我找到了这世上最不搞笑的人
I have found the least funny person on the entire planet.

207
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,760
好吧
Okay.

208
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,090
但我看到了别的闪光点
But I saw something there,

209
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,420
所以我带走了你
so I took you on.

210
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,050
我给你接了广告
And I got you the commercials,

211
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,640
帮你接肥皂剧
got you the soaps,

212
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,400
我还帮你找到一份
eventually got you a job paying you

213
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,200
年薪三百万的工作
almost three million dollars a year,

214
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,030
让你名声大噪  就算你在室外27度时
making you so famous that you could wear a ski cap

215
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,910
戴着滑雪帽  也没人会说三道四
when it is 80 degrees outside, and no one would say a damn thing.

216
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,730
好了  蕾妮
Okay, Lanie...

217
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,510
把帽子摘了
Take off that hat.

218
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,080
好吧
Okay.

219
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,870
木已成舟  不是吗
What's done is done, right?

220
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,540
我们能不能就...
I mean, you know, can't we just...

221
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,530
别再提了
move on?

222
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,080
布莱恩  说话
Brian... speak.

223
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,490
你跟节目组签的合同还有两年才到期
You're contractually bound to the show for another two years.

224
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,060
好吧
Okay.

225
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,730
好吧  如果我不演呢
All right, and if I refuse?

226
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,750
好了  仔细听我说  凯文
Right, listen to me very carefully, Kevin.

227
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,780
电视网是你的老板
The network owns you.

228
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,610
他们会起诉你赔偿损失
They can sue you for damages.

229
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,110
他们会让你倾家荡产
They could bankrupt you.

230
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,150
即使有人往他们公共饮用水里
And even if someone slipped a chill pill

231
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,820
放了镇静药
into their collective drink,

232
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,460
在法律约束下  你未来两年也无法工作
you would still be legally unable to work for the next two years.

233
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,780
无论是在哪家工作室  电视网
That's for any studio, any network.

234
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,660
电视剧或是电影
Television or film.

235
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,450
所以...
So...

236
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,790
以上是好消息
that's the good news.

237
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,910
下面要说的这部分你不会喜欢
Now here's the part you're not gonna like.

238
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,480
她今晚要在她家
She's throwing this big...

239
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,470
举办一个大型好莱坞派对  对吗
Hollywood party at her house tonight, right?

240
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,100
电视网总裁和很多人会到场
The network president's gonna be there, everyone.

241
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,770
我要到过去  五体投地恳请他们
I'm supposed to show up, get down on my hands and knees

242
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,370
让我继续演《靓男保姆》
and beg to be the Manny again. Yeah.

243
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,860
他们是我老板  妹妹  我不知道该怎么办
They own me, Sis. I don't know what I'm gonna do.

244
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,890
我知道  并且你已经做了
Well, I do, and you did it already.

245
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,260
需要我给你看那段网上的视频吗
Do you need me to show you the video on YouTube?

246
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,050
不用了
No.

247
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,600
凯文  我都认识你一辈子了
Kevin, I've known you your whole life.

248
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,270
除了最初的那两分钟
Well, except for those two minutes at the beginning.

249
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,100
你努力的每件事都成功了
You've succeed at everything you've ever tried.

250
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,080
所以接下来这样  好吗
So here's what's gonna happen. Okay?

251
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,920
你去参加那派对
You're gonna go to that party,

252
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,710
大步走向那电视网老总
and you're gonna march up to that network guy,

253
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,950
然后大声说"奶爸不干了"
and you're gonna tell him, "Manny out!"

254
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,810
"奶爸不干了"
Manny out?

255
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,410
奶爸不干了  奶爸不干了
Manny out. Manny out!

256
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,230
你不该那样说...  好吧
Well, you're not supposed to say the... Okay.

257
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,730
奶爸不干了  真不错
Manny out! That's good.

258
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,620
问你个问题
Let me ask you a question.

259
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,120
在你没出生的头两分钟里  我是怎么过的
What did I ever do those first two minutes without you?

260
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,840
你嚎啕大哭  还像个"搅屎棍"
Oh, you cried, and you crapped a lot.

261
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,850
听起来是我的风格
Sounds about right. Yeah.

262
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,390
你今晚会和我一起去派  对吧
So you're coming to the party, though, tonight with me, right?

00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,930
或是  奶爸不干了
Or maybe Manny out!

274
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,430
管他呢  怎样都行
Whatever... whatever works.

275
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:15,710
{\an8}我们的生活
第一季  第二集

276
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,960
水蔓延开来
The water exhales

277
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,860
当微风拂动
and when the wind blows

278
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,080
便又是另一番景色了
the landscape is altered

279
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,000
这只豹一定...
this pard must be...

280
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,000
好了  小姑娘们  最后再看五分钟
All right, little mamas, five-minute warning

281
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,140
-就该去刷牙了  -可是...
- till teeth brushing. - But...

282
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,400
没得讨价还价
It's not open for discussion.

283
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,510
-威廉  -威廉
- Hey, William - William!

284
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,760
你们好
Hi, everybody.

285
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,910
你这么晚才回来
You're home late.

286
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,300
一切还好吗
Everything okay?

287
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,770
没事  我很好
Yeah, yes. I'm fine.

288
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,700
就是忙了一天了
Just a long day.

289
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,850
我想先回床上休息了
I think I may just go lay myself down for the night.

290
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,330
晚安
Well... night.

291
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,430
晚安
Night.

292
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,600
好了  小鬼们  牙齿可不会自己变白哦
Okay, monsters, these teeth aren't gonna brush themselves.

293
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,930
天啊  宝贝  都吃什么了变这么沉
Oh, God. Hey, girl, what you been eating?

294
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,530
冰淇淋[音近"我要尖叫"]Ice cream.

295
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,190
你尖叫什么  我才要大叫呢
You scream? I'm gonna scream

296
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,640
我还得抱你俩上楼
if I got to carry you up these stairs.

297
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,560
你们俩太沉了
You're too heavy.

298
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,740
我要跟大家大声宣布的事就是
Guess the thing I really need to say out loud to everyone is,

299
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,170
我一周内成功减掉三磅了
I'm down three pounds in one week.

300
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,440
朋友们  没什么  行了  不用着...
Oh, guys, come on. Stop. Stop. You don't...

301
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,810
好吧好吧  你们继续吧
Well, okay, fine, keep going.

302
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,220
我  我好开心  我真的
I'm-I'm so happy. I'm...

303
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,280
今天工作不顺  我就去温蒂家买汉堡了
Well, I had a crap day at work, so I stopped at Wendy's.

304
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
{\an8}美国第三大汉堡包快餐连锁店

305
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,050
我准备在车上吃
And I was about to eat in the car,

306
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,110
要知道  我最喜欢这么干
which is... all you know is my thing.

307
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,370
可当离开汽车餐厅的那一刻
The second I left the drive-through,

308
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:47,110
我就咬牙把那十块钱的汉堡扔出车窗外了
I threw ten dollars' worth of Wendy's out of my moving car,

309
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,760
然后我回到家里  只吃了沙拉
and I went home, and I had a salad.

310
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,310
我知道我很可笑
I know I'm ridiculous.

311
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,660
在你们眼里我就是个笑话
I know I'm a joke to you guys.

312
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,840
我知道我身材走样  或者其他叫法
I know I have body distortion issues or whatever it's called,

313
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,640
但这是真的
but it's real.

314
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,390
残酷的事实
It's brutal.

315
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,970
我多想让你们看看
I wish I could show you guys

316
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,770
我自己在镜子里的样子
what I see when I look in the mirror...

317
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,130
省省吧
Oh, for God's sake.

318
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,550
麦迪逊  你才95斤
Madison, you weigh 105 pounds.

319
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,410
要是你照镜子时觉得自己是个胖妹
If you feel like a fat girl when you look in the mirror,

320
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,130
那怎么不上秤试试呢
why don't you step a damn scale?

321
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,700
看到那数字"九-十-五"
And when the scale reads "One, zero, five,"

322
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,280
你就知道自己根本不胖了
you know that you're not fat.

323
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,170
还有劳丽  汉堡店的事是吧
And Laurie, that Wendy's story, okay.

324
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,820
不好意思  但是你只是乱扔垃圾罢了
I'm sorry, but you're just a litterer.

325
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,610
你就是个该死的环境破坏者
You're just a littering damn litterer.

326
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,780
看来是时候休息一下了
Well, that feels like a good place for a break.

327
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,280
你在一群胖子面前变身成了绿巨人
You hulked out on a bunch of fatties.

328
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,910
一点也不好笑  托比
You're not going to make me laugh, Toby.

329
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,490
怎么了  孩子
What's up, kid?

330
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,030
我哥硬拉我去参加个噩梦般的好莱坞派对
My brother is making me go to this nightmare Hollywood party

331
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,490
今晚在他经纪人家里办的
at his agent's house tonight.

332
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,610
我就出去买裙子
Yeah, I went to buy a dress,

333
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,190
结果没一件合身的  一件都没有
and nothing fit, literally nothing.

334
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,850
一切都糟透了
Everything looks terrible.

335
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:06,970
我一点儿都没瘦下来
I'm not losing weight.

336
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,580
我快饿死了
I'm starving.

337
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,700
说不上来
I don't know.

338
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,770
也许就因为这事吧
That's what's up, I guess.

339
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,180
好吧
Okay.

340
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,070
你哥的经纪人是蕾妮・舒尔茨  对吧
Hey, your brother's agent is Lanie Shultz, right?

341
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,150
对啊
Yeah.

342
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,670
凯特  蕾妮・舒尔茨
Kate, Lanie Shultz

343
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,830
是我所谓的娱乐圈里
is one of the most powerful agents

344
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,970
最有权势的经纪人之一
in what I like to call... show business.

345
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,480
我听说《死侍》就是她的主意
I heard that Deadpool was her idea.

346
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,160
要不就是《汉密尔顿》
Or maybe it was Hamilton.

347
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,320
我把这两个搞混了
I get those two confused.

348
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,800
总之  凯特你一定要带我去那个派对
Anyway, Kate, you are so taking me to that party.

349
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,480
不行  我不想让你看到派对上的我
No. I don't want you to see me there.

350
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,340
参与这种事是我最糟糕的时刻
Like, I am at my worst at those things.

351
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,000
凯特  伤害一个厌食症女患者
Kate, you are at your worst

352
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,020
才是你最糟糕的时刻
when you are eviscerating the anorexic lady,

353
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,880
但我依然在你身边
and I am still standing here.

354
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,210
我们吃过三次午餐  四次晚餐
Look, we have had three lunches and four dinner dates.

355
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,130
亲热过七次  爱抚过对方两次
We have made out seven times and heavy-petted twice.

356
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,710
我们俩马上就要
Our plane is rapidly approaching

357
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,950
登上爱情的巨轮了
the boyfriend-girlfriend zone,

358
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,730
而我呢  已经准备好上船了
and, I, for one, am preparing myself for landing.

359
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,810
但是我希望咱俩的话题
But I need to know that everything

360
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,940
不要总是围绕着体重
isn't gonna always be about our weight.

361
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,760
好吗  我们得在派对上尽情狂欢
All right? We need to be able to cut loose at parties.

362
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,040
我们要精心打扮  我们还要做爱
We need to get really dressed up, we need to have sex.

363
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,200
我只是随口一说
I just slipped that in there very casually

364
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,320
因为我认为那是
because I think that's something

365
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,220
我们不久后就该做的事
that we should start doing very soon.

366
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,960
凯特  看在老天爷的份上
So, Kate, I am asking you, please,

367
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,530
我请求你  咱俩能抽出一天时间
for the love of God, can we spend one fat-free night

368
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,500
不去想肥胖的事而是参加《死侍》
at the house of the lady who came up with the idea

369
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,480
或《汉密尔顿》制片人举办的派对吗
for Deadpool and/or Hamilton?

370
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,770
你在笑吗
Is that a... is that a smile?

371
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,200
没错那是代表答应的微笑
Is that...? Yes, that's a yes and a smile.

372
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,300
大伙  布鲁斯・班纳[绿巨人]恢复正常了
All right, hey, guys, Bruce Banner's back.

373
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,850
没事了  绿巨人消失了
Everything's fine. The Hulk is gone.

374
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,470
大家继续吧  我向大家道个歉
Let the healing continue. Sorry about that.

375
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,330
你舒服吗
You comfy?

376
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,180
睡吧  宝贝
Okay, sweetness.

377
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,960
晚安  妈妈爱你
Good night. I love you so much.

378
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,950
我也爱你
I love you, too.

379
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,380
妈妈
Mom?

380
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,970
怎么了  宝贝
Yeah, babe?

381
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,840
我今天只吃了水果
I only ate fruit today.

382
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,850
你明白妈妈只是希望你健康成长吧
You know I just want you to be healthy, right?

383
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,140
妈妈也希望你开心
And I want you to be happy.

384
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,570
你开心吗
Are you happy?

385
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,890
大多数时候吧
For the most part.

386
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,000
那妈妈也就开心了
Well, then, I'm happy, too.

387
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,950
要不咱俩一起保持健康怎么样
Tell you what. How about you and I find a healthy balance together?

388
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,720
你觉得怎么样  不错吧
How does that sound? That sounds good?

389
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,550
好的
All right.

390
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,600
闭嘴
Shut up!

391
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,110
你闭嘴  "白家黑"
You shut up, Webster.

392
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,350
别给我起外号
Stop calling me names!

393
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,330
孩子们
Boys?

394
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,460
不能打架  不能打架
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

395
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,120
快住手  立刻回自己床上去
No, stop. To your beds right now.

396
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,760
赶紧
Now.

397
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,300
是谁先吵架的
Okay, who am I yelling at first?

398
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,900
小凯  你怎么了
Kev, bud, what is the deal?

399
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,730
你为什么总跟弟弟过不去
Why are you always so hard on him?

400
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,450
别人觉得我俩是兄弟很奇怪
Everybody thinks it's weird that we're brothers.

401
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,530
别人怎么想那是他们的事
You know it doesn't matter what people think.

402
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,200
他是你的弟弟  凯文
He is your little brother, Kevin.

403
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,280
你们一定要互相照应
You have to be there for one another.

404
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,950
你听懂了吗
Do you hear me?

405
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,590
懂了
Yes.

406
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,440
我爱你
I love you.

407
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,390
你能让他对我好点吗
Can you force him be nice?

408
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,750
我会尽力的
I'll see what I can do.

409
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,250
答应我  你要当个听话的乖孩子
Promise me you'll always be good.

410
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,600
我也会尽力的
I'll see what I can do, too.

411
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,740
我爱你
I love you.

412
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,690
赶紧睡觉吧  孩子们
Now get some sleep, please.

413
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,000
不许再吵架了
No more fighting.

414
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,030
别让我再发现你们闹别扭
Don't make me come back in here.

415
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,550
晚安  我爱你们
Good night, I love you.

416
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,320
亲爱的
Hi, baby.

417
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,960
亲爱的
Hi, baby.

418
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,820
我错过哄他们睡觉了吗
Did I miss putting them down?

419
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,420
也就晚了一小时
Just by an hour.

420
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,080
我刚才...
Well, I was...

421
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,970
刚才在买东西
I was-- oh, shopping.

422
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,940
我在买东西
I was shopping.

423
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,930
我知道
I know...

424
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,680
我们最近产生了一些分歧
I know we haven't been on the same page lately.

425
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,890
但我们得回到正轨上来  宝贝
That we just got to get back on track, baby.

426
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,070
所以
So...

427
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,100
就当这是...
consider this a...

428
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,440
一份贵重的谢罪礼吧
way-too-expensive peace offering.

429
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,680
我们已经不止是偏离正轨了
I think we've been more than off track.

430
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,710
你觉得我们目前为止做得怎么样
Hey, how do you think we're doing so far?

431
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,220
当父母这方面
At parenting?

432
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,670
-我...  -我觉得我们也就六分
- I... - 'Cause I think we're at a six.

433
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,670
平心而论  从一到十
On a sliding scale, one through ten,

434
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,960
我觉得打六分都算很大方了
I think we're at a six and I think I'm being generous.

435
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,980
-小贝  -那就七分
- Bec... - Seven, fine,

436
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,890
但那只是因为我们有三个孩子
but only because there are three of them.

437
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,550
-宝贝...  -问题是
- Baby, I... - And the thing is,

438
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,060
我拼命想达到九分的标准
I'm trying really hard to get us to a nine.

439
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,500
因为这些可爱的孩子值得九分的父母
Because they are cute kids, and they deserve nine-parents.

440
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,410
但我觉得  只有我在努力  杰克
And, the thing is, I feel like I'm there, Jack.

441
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,470
只有我在以九分的标准照顾他们
I feel like I'm operating at a nine.

442
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,780
因为我给他们每人准备
Because I do individualized lunches

443
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,480
不同的午餐  挨个哄他们睡觉
and I do individualized tuck-ins for each kid

444
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,130
这样没人会不开心
so nobody feels gypped.

445
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,360
而且
And...

446
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,770
当你回到家  做自己的时候
When you're home, and you're you,

447
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,130
比我强太多了
you're way better than I am.

448
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,340
当你做自己时你是十分  杰克
You're a ten when you're you, Jack.

449
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,880
但你回家越来越晚
But you're getting home later and later

450
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,940
当你好不容易回了家以后  你...
and when you do come home, you're...

451
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,740
小贝  你在说什么
Bec, what are you saying?

452
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,530
你不能再这样喝酒了
The drinking has to stop.

453
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,120
你必须克服它  宝贝
You have to reign it in, baby,

454
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,250
因为我决不允许我家有人酗酒
because I won't have it in my house.

455
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,410
-你不允许你家...  -不允许
- You won't have it in your house. - I won't.

456
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,380
如果这是个问题  解决它
So if it's a problem, fix it.

457
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,400
成熟点  解决它
Be a man, and fix it.

458
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,590
我不能再让你拉低我们的分数了
Because I'm done letting you lower our score.

459
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,460
不是吧
Damn.

460
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,640
-还行吧  -是啊
- Yeah? - Yeah.

461
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,810
太行了
Hell to the yeah.

462
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,780
谢谢
Thanks.

463
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,280
你穿得挺有型的
You look dapper.

464
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,740
混娱乐圈嘛
Ah, show business.

465
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,440
太好了  到齐了
Oh, great, you're, uh--

466
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,510
我们该走了
We got to go, you know?

467
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,910
-我们要迟到了  -好
- 'Cause we're gonna be late. - Okay.

468
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,530
你就穿这身吗
You're wearing that?

469
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,570
对
Yeah.

470
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,580
真不错
That's great.

471
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,070
-你看上去棒极了  -帽子太骚了吗
- You look awesome. - Oh, is the hat too much?

472
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,350
帽子才是精华
The hat is everything.

473
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,950
是啊  那可是真正的孔雀毛
Yeah, that's a real peacock feather.

474
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,110
走吧  娱乐圈我来了
Come on, show business!

475
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:21,050
快去  你要是需要我就来这找我
Hey, go, okay? And I'm right here if you need me.

476
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:21,930
好吗
Okay?

477
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,850
-奶爸不干了  -给他们点颜色瞧瞧
- Manny out. - Go get 'em.

478
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,100
咱们俩会惊艳全场的
You and I are crushing that dance floor.

479
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,600
我们走  来吧
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

480
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,760
快来  快点
Come on, come on, come on.

481
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,860
拜托
Please.

482
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,490
天啊
Oh, no!

483
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,640
来呀  跳起来
Come on! Come on.

484
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,350
凯特
Kate.

485
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,010
凯特
Kate.

486
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,200
凯特
Kate.

487
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,910
好吧  咱们走  喝点酒去
All right, come on, come on, we're getting you drunk.

488
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,300
-来  我们喝酒去  -我们走了吧
- Come on, yup. Time to get drunk. - Let's just go.

489
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:20,590
杰克
Jack,

490
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,480
我是米格尔
It's Miguel.

491
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,170
已经很晚了  但又怕明早见不着你
It's late, so I'm leaving you a message at the office

492
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,560
所以就给你办公室留了条言
in case I miss you in the morning.

493
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,630
我之前好像越界了
Feel like I overstepped before.

494
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,150
你知道我爱你
Um, you know I love you,

495
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,540
我也爱你们一家人
you know I love you guys.

496
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,880
怎么说...
Hell...

497
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,310
或者说我只是嫉妒你们俩
I'm jealous of your relationship, if anything.

498
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,800
之前在酒吧我不该说那些的
Uh, I shouldn't have said anything at the bar.

499
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,090
我好像又说过火了
Now I'm just overdoing it.

500
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,720
就这些  再见
Okay. Bye.

501
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,740
{\an7}外科病理学最新进展
胃癌

502
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,330
你该去睡觉了  很晚了
You need to get some sleep, it's late.

503
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,260
你早上差不多四点就起床了
You've been up since, like, 4:00 this morning.

504
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,200
我知道
No, I know.

505
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,390
还有五分钟
Just five more minutes.

506
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,040
去洗澡
Shower.

507
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,090
然后睡觉
Sleep.

508
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,260
赶紧去
Now.

509
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,960
如果你洗得够快
You shower quick,

510
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,470
最后这五分钟还可以换种方式运动
you can work off that last five minutes a different way.

511
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,840
我很高兴咱们能聚在一起
I am so happy that we could all get together.

512
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,900
解决一些问题...
You know, work through, and...

513
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,130
凯文只是心情不太好
and... Kevin just feels awful...

514
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,930
蕾妮  虽然很抱歉  但这一切荒谬至极
I'm so sorry, this is whole thing, Lanie, is ridiculous.

515
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,150
我是说
I mean...

516
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,030
曼宁先生
Mr. Manning.

517
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,120
我真心感激你的电视网
I'm truly grateful for everything

518
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,190
为我所做的一切  真的
that your network has done for me, I am.

519
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,430
但请允许我任性一次  先生
But please let me go with God, sir.

520
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,690
我之前处理问题的方式
The way I handled myself,

521
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,270
确实不太对  我第一个站出来承认
I mean, that was wrong, I'll be the first one to admit that.

522
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,480
我确实做错了
That-that was wrong.

523
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,980
但我们能不能抛开前嫌...
But can't we all, at this point, just, sort of, you know...

524
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,600
向前看  好吗
sort of move on, right?

525
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,320
你是个好孩子  凯文
You're a good kid, Kevin.

526
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,360
我很欣赏你的诚实
I appreciate your honesty.

527
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,260
谢谢
Thank you.

528
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,820
这部剧收视率不错
The show, it's a solid performer,

529
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,140
但不是我们电视网最重要的节目
but it's not the biggest thing on my network.

530
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,320
如果不是蕾妮向我推荐你
Without Lanie telling me,

531
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,600
我会从这些端餐盘的服务员里
would I have known you from one of these waiters

532
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,690
认识你这个无名小卒吗
passing around the chicken skewers?

533
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,580
-应该不会吧  -是吗
- Probably not. - Really?

534
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,440
我并不关心我的三流喜剧幕后
I really don't care what happens behind the scenes

535
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,440
发生了些什么
on my third-rated sitcom.

536
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,010
你知道我关心什么吗
You know what I do care about?

537
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,940
圣马丁  凯文
St. Maarten, Kevin.

538
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,150
我要在圣马丁建一个家
I'm building a home in St. Maarten

539
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,460
不出两年我就要退休了
and in two years I'm going to retire,

540
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,830
然后我会和我的爱妻搬去那里
and my favorite wife and I are going to move there.

541
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,620
在那之前
Until then,

542
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,090
我只想安稳度过这两年
I plan on just drifting through these two years

543
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:50,010
尽可能地避免痛苦和波折
as painlessly and drama-free as possible.

544
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,820
就像服用吗啡一样  凯文
Like I'm on morphine, Kevin,

545
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,140
我就想这么度过这两年
that's how I'll be drifting through those years.

546
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,480
好吧
Okay.

547
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,150
这主意很棒
That's... great, you know?

548
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:06,750
随心所欲
Go with God.

549
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,820
问题是...  借过一下  亲爱的
You know, the thing is-- excuse me darling.

550
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,870
给热门情景喜剧换个新男主
Recasting the lead on a hit sitcom,

551
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,090
就不是服用吗啡了  你说呢  凯文
isn't exactly drifting on morphine, now is it, Kevin?

552
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,740
所以很遗憾  孩子
So unfortunately, my boy,

553
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,930
你必须继续演这部剧
you're not gonna be leaving the show.

554
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:32,360
如果你不演  我只能毁了你的生活和事业
If you do, I'll be forced to Nagasaki your life and career.

555
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,490
你听说过一个叫泰勒・詹宁斯的演员吗
Hey, have you ever heard of the actor, uh, Taylor Jennings?

556
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:38,330
没听说过
I'm not familiar with the name.

557
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,610
我毁了他
I Nagasaki'd him.

558
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,740
孩子  好好拿钱
So take the money, kid.

559
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,940
未来几年安心演戏
Ride out the next couple years, all right?

560
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,460
否则  我会让你成为比现在
Otherwise, I'll make you a bigger laughingstock

561
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,660
更大的笑柄
than you already are.

562
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,290
成交
Deal?

563
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,760
抱歉  我要去...
I'm sorry, I'm j...I'm gonna go, uh...

564
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,300
找我的妹妹
my sister's here.

565
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,780
我得去看一下她
I'm gonna go check on her.

566
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,540
是他的双胞胎妹妹
It's his twin sister.

567
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,240
一个胖姑娘
Big girl.

568
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,850
-你喜欢喝醉的凯特  -我喜欢喝醉的凯特
- You love drunk Kate. - I love drunk Kate.

569
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,070
等一下  什么
Wait, what?

570
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,840
进展怎么样  我喝得烂醉
How'd it go? I'm wasted.

571
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,710
不太好
Not good.

572
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,700
好  天啊  太好了
Good? Oh, my God, that's great.

573
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,060
不不不  是"不好"
No, no, no, no, not good.

574
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,950
我不知道我该怎么做
It did not...I don't know what I'm gonna do.

575
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,180
-我在钓鱼  -你钓了一条大鱼
- Gone fishing. - You caught a whopper!

576
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,280
快收线   把我收上去
Come reel me in, got to reel me in.

577
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,280
这是我第一次钓鱼
It's my first time fishing.

578
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,780
-还会有下次  -好吧
- Won't be his last. - Well...

579
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,150
哪只小怪兽站在我门口
Which little monster's standing at my door?

580
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,800
没关系  我年纪大了  怪兽都吓不到我了
It's okay, I'm way too old to be scared of monsters.

581
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,100
我想我们该谈谈了
I think it's time you and I had a talk.

582
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,270
{\an8}兰德尔

583
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:43,120
我已经想上课想疯了
I can't wait until the next day of school starts.

584
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,120
大家快看  是"白家黑"
Hey, everyone, it's Webster!

585
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,010
小凯
Kev,

586
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,650
过来  凯文  别管"白家黑"了
come on, Kevin, ditch Webster.

587
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,530
我们走
Let's go.

588
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,060
快过来
Come on.

589
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,070
现在给你打电话  是不是太晚了
Hey, uh... is it too late out there?

590
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,760
我记得你经常熬夜
I know you're usually up late, right?

591
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,390
不晚  我刚刚...
No, I was just, uh...

592
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,490
在赶几份文件
catching up on some paperwork.

593
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,010
太好了
Good, uh...

594
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,010
我知道  发生那些事情之后
Hey, listen, I-I know I've owed you a phone call

595
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:21,710
我应该给你打个电话
since everything went down,

596
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,830
但因为实在太离谱了
it's been crazy out here, just... you know.

597
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,250
没关系
No, it's all good.

598
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,050
凯特都告诉我了
Kate's kept me up to speed.

599
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,150
很好
Good.

600
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,740
他们说决不会让我离开剧组
They said they're not gonna let me out of the show, man.

601
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,800
而我...
And I...

602
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,470
我不知道要怎么做
I don't know what I'm gonna do, like...

603
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,630
他们还要牵制我两年  甚至更久
they locked me in for two more years, maybe more.

604
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,960
真糟
Damn.

605
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,530
那你打算怎么做
Well, what are you gonna do?

606
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,280
我倒是希望你能告诉我
I was kind of hoping you'd tell me.

607
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,420
因为你在乎我的想法吗
Oh, because you care what I think?

608
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,250
因为我在乎所有人的想法
Because I care what everyone thinks, man.

609
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,170
你知道的
You know that.

610
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,400
对你来说  我不是个好哥哥  是吗
I was not a very good brother to you, was I?

611
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,140
对  你不是
No, you weren't.

612
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,690
但你还有时间弥补
But you've still got time.

613
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,780
没错
Yeah, uh...

614
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,020
总之  时间不早了
Anyway, look, it's getting late, man, I, you know...

615
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,010
我该挂电话了
I probably should go.

616
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,030
那个...
It's, uh...

617
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,900
凯特在这呢  我在跟兰德尔打电话
Kate's here, it's Randall.

618
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,430
-好啊  兰德尔  -你好
- Oh, hey, Randall! - Hey.

619
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,170
总之吧  或许我应该...
Anyway, yeah, I-I should probably, uh...

620
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,270
回去把自己卖给电视网
I got to go back inside and sell my soul to the network,

621
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,530
就像妓女那样
like the whore that I am.

622
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,620
小凯
Hey, Kev.

623
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,600
深呼吸  好吗
Deep breath, okay?

624
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,850
来吧  兄弟  第一个...
Come on, man. First came...

625
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:41,930
是我
Me.

626
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:42,980
爸爸说...
And Dad said...

627
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,360
"天哪"
"Gee."

628
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,820
-然后是...  -是我
-And then came... - Me!

629
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,970
妈妈说...
And Mom said...

630
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,370
"妈呀"  接下来是...
"Whee!" And then came...

631
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,890
是我  然后他们说
Me. And they said...

632
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:54,890
"三个了"
"That's three."

633
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,030
-三个小家伙  -三个小家伙
- Big Three! - Big Three!

634
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,630
好点了吗
You good?

635
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,180
我很好  我很好
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

636
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,670
-凯文  -怎么
- Kevin? - Yeah?

637
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,530
爸妈可没养过什么妓女
Mom and Dad didn't raise no whores.

638
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,480
除了凯特画眼线搞叛逆那段时间
Except briefly, during Kate's eyeliner phase.

639
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:25,920
是啊
Yeah.

640
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,240
晚安  小弟
Night, little brother.

641
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,500
晚安  大哥
Night, big brother.

642
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,750
亲爱的
Hon?

643
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,790
-给你  -谢谢
- There you go. - Thank you.

644
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,270
我就开门见山吧
Can I cut to the chase?

645
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,480
你说了算
It's your meeting.

646
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:00,600
八年前  我第一次怀孕
Eight years ago, I was, um, pregnant for the first time.

647
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,090
当时兰德尔在竞争公司合伙人的职位
And Randall was vying for partner at his firm.

648
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,800
我们毫不犹豫买了这幢房子
We'd just bought this house on faith,

649
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,860
虽然有好多地方要装修
even though it needed a lot of work,

650
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,150
虽然我们根本买不起
even though we couldn't afford it whatsoever.

651
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,150
后来兰德尔成了合伙人
Then Randall made partner.

652
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,920
房子的所有活都是他自己干的
He did all the work on the house himself,

653
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,560
所以我们没花一分钱
so we didn't have to spend a penny.

654
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,150
而且在我怀孕期间
And he made sure I didn't lift a finger

655
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,840
他一丁点事都没让我做
during my pregnancy.

656
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,330
他是个好男人
He's a good man.

657
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,460
不  不是好
No, he's not good.

658
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,720
是完美
He's perfect.

659
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,300
可问题是  他失眠了
Problem is, he stopped sleeping.

660
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,180
有一天早上  我在卫生间
And then one morning, I was in the bathroom,

661
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,160
他大声喊我
and he called out to me.

662
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,600
他懵了  你懂吗
And he was confused, you know?

663
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,090
他懵了  因为他...
He was confused because he...

664
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,650
什么都看不见了
couldn't see anything.

665
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:55,350
我的丈夫  我的靠山
My husband-- my mountain of a man--

666
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,580
他的眼睛什么都看不见了
could literally no longer see things through his eyes.

667
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:03,440
就好像当了28年的完美之人
It was as if 28 years of being that perfect

668
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
在那天早上突然就把他击垮了
had all caught up to him that morning.

669
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,060
后来他...
And he, um...

670
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,610
他解决了那个问题
he pulled himself out of it.

671
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,740
他自己治好了眼睛
He self-corrected,

672
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,790
因为我丈夫就是这样的人
'cause that's what my man does.

673
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,570
兰德尔并不是没有缺点  威廉
Randall is not free of vice, William.

674
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,230
他的缺点就是他的善良
His vice is his goodness.

675
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:33,240
他强迫自己必须完美
It's his compulsive drive to be perfect.

676
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,460
所以我才爱他...
It's why I love him...

677
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,000
也正因为如此有时我得保护他
but it's also why I have to protect him sometimes, you know?

678
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:46,150
所以  我得问你几个问题
So now, I'm gonna have to ask you a couple questions,

679
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:51,980
问几个他问不出口的问题
questions he would probably be too polite to ask himself.

680
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,550
尽管问
Ask away.

681
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,480
你借的钱
The money you borrow.

682
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,990
你用来坐车了吗
You use it for the bus?

683
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,070
是的
Yes.

684
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,230
你去哪了
Where do you go?

685
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,080
你每天都在外面待很久
You're gone all day, every day.

686
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,580
我家在费城  要坐很久的车
My place in Philadelphia, it's a long ride.

687
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:14,780
为什么
Why?

688
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,670
你还在吸毒吗
Are you using drugs?

689
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,660
-你去买毒品吗  -不是
- Are you getting drugs? - No.

690
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,040
你真的生病了吗
Are you really sick?

691
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,110
真的
Yes, I am.

692
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,590
贝丝  我之前就说过  而且我是真心的
Beth, I said it before, and I really meant it,

693
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,340
如果你们嫌我待太久了
if I'm overstaying my welcome,

694
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,960
我希望你们能直接告诉我
I wish you would just say it.

695
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,260
威廉  你待得太久...
William, you are overstaying...

696
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,080
贝丝
Beth.

697
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,810
你们在干什么
What are you doing?

698
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:42,980
总得有人
Somebody has to

699
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,840
-把事问清楚  宝贝...  -是因为猫
- ask the questions here, baby... - It's a cat.

700
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:47,960
我有只猫
I have a cat.

701
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,750
它是我的唯一了
It's all I really have.

702
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:54,750
它叫克鲁尼
His name's Clooney.

703
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,180
挺讽刺的名字  因为它很丑
One of those ironic names, 'cause he's a pretty ugly cat.

704
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,270
我来回跑是为了喂它
I go back and forth to feed him.

705
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,330
每天坐三个小时大巴
Three hours on the bus each day.

706
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,870
你为什么不直接跟我们说你有只猫
Why wouldn't you just tell us you had a cat?

707
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,980
你们小女儿有哮喘
The little one has asthma

708
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,670
我知道如果我说了猫的事
and I knew if I brought up the cat,

709
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,770
你们会让我带它来
you'd tell me to bring it,

710
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,030
这样就会添麻烦
that would cause problems.

711
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,700
但我不想给你们添麻烦
And I don't want to cause any problems,

712
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,290
因为添了麻烦我就得走
'cause if I cause problems, I'd have to leave.

713
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:17,880
但...
And...

714
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,240
但我不想走
and I don't want to leave.

715
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,710
六个月前  医生告诉我还有三个月时间
Six months ago, some doctor told me I had three to live.

716
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,520
但不知怎么的  最近我没那么难受了
But for some reason, I don't feel so bad lately.

717
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,020
也许是因为这个家
Maybe to do with this house.

718
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:31,810
我不知道
I don't know.

719
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,600
说实话  我从未想过
Truth is, I'd never thought

720
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,310
我的生命中  除了那只丑猫
I'd have anything to care about again

721
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,200
还会有其他值得在乎的东西  所以...
besides an ugly cat, so...

722
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,090
我感觉自己现在很贱
Well, now I feel like a bitch.

723
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,250
不好笑
It's not funny.

724
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,190
不好笑
It's not.

725
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,010
不好笑
It's not funny.

726
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:01,960
还有两小时我就要把胃呕出来了
I'm about two hours away from throwing up violently.

727
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,670
你能帮我扶着头发吗  托比
Are you gonna hold my hair for me, Toby?

728
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,690
不  我要待在这里
No. I-I'm still gonna be at this party,

729
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,430
看能不能钓到一个吉尔莫女孩
trying to bang a Gilmore Girl.

730
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,140
祝你成功
Well, go for both.

731
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,170
多一个吉尔莫  多一分快乐
Gil-more the Gil-merrier.

732
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,080
我的生活总是围绕着体重  托比
It's always gonna be about the weight for me, Toby.

733
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,440
我小时候就是这样了
It's been my story ever since I was a little girl.

734
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,970
每当我试着不去想
And every moment that I'm not thinking about it,

735
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,020
我还是会想
I'm thinking about it.

736
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,270
比如
Like...

737
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,940
这椅子我不会坐垮吧
Will this chair hold me?

738
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,640
这衣服我能穿进去吗
Will this dress fit me?

739
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:47,450
如果哪天我怀孕了
And if I ever get pregnant, would...

740
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,070
会有人看出来吗
will anyone ever notice?

741
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:57,180
这就是我生活的重心  无法改变
It's just at the core of who I am, it's just deep inside,

742
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:00,170
八杯龙舌兰下肚也只能自欺欺人几小时
and eight tequila shots can only mask that for a couple hours.

743
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,780
-所以...  -我懂
- So... - I know.

744
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,540
其实你喝了十杯
And it was ten tequila shots,

745
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,120
但我懂  我理解
but I... I get it. I know.

746
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,300
再说一句
And just for the record,

747
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:18,890
这身衣服真的很配你
this dress is fitting you in all the right places.

748
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,250
这身旧衣服
This old thing?

749
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,550
我就随便穿的
I mean, I-I just threw it on.

750
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,670
你随便穿的
Oh, you just threw it on?

751
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,190
我想都没多想
I didn't even think about it.

752
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,940
他来了
There he is.

753
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,890
我让他们滚蛋了
I told 'em to go screw themselves.

754
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,460
他们怎么说
And what'd they say?

755
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,240
很多尖酸又刻薄的话
A lot of mean, scary things.

756
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,270
我要去演戏剧
I'm gonna do theater. You know?

757
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,790
我要搬到纽约去
I'm moving to New York.

758
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,590
娱乐圈啊
Show business.

759
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,830
你怎么在这里
What are you doing out here?

760
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,680
我不想睡得离你太远
I don't like sleeping far away from you.

761
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,550
我再也不喝酒了
No more drinking.

762
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,050
这不是说戒就...
You can't just stop...

763
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,040
我能
I can.

764
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,170
为了你  我能戒
For you, I can.

765
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:32,770
我会戒
I will.

766
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,710
我小的时候
You know, when I was a little boy,

767
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:42,540
我不知道长大后要成为什么样的人
I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grew up.

768
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:51,120
而大人们总会问孩子这种问题
Adults always ask little kids that.

769
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,940
我从没想出一个好答案
You know? I never had a good answer.

770
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,590
直到我28岁那年
Not until... not until I was 28.

771
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,750
直到我遇到了你
Till the day that I met you.

772
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:10,620
我才确信自己想成为什么样的人
That's when I knew exactly what I wanted to be when I grew up,

773
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,920
我想成为让你幸福的男人
I wanted to be the man that made you happy.

774
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,540
你让我很幸福
You make me happy.

775
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,280
不总是那样
Not always.

776
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,320
最近就没有
Not lately.

777
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:33,900
从今以后  我要为你做到11分  亲爱的
From here on out, I'm gonna be an 11 for you, baby.

778
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:37,630
不
No...

779
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,730
豁出去了
Screw that.

780
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,340
从现在开始  我要做12分的好丈夫
I'm gonna be a 12 for you, from here out.

781
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,030
11分给孩子们
I'll be an 11 for the kids,

782
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,500
12分给你
but you get a 12.

783
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,170
你能原谅我吗
Do you forgive me?

784
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:04,530
你像只拉布拉多犬一样睡在门外
You slept outside our bedroom door like a Labrador.

785
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,200
我当然原谅你了
Of course I forgive you.

786
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,020
我还能送你礼物吗
Can I still give you my gift?

787
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,820
如果你非要送的话
If you insist.

788
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:33,980
喜欢吗
Do you like it?

789
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,300
-我买了月亮是因为  -我们的专属之歌
- I got a moon because of... - Our song.

790
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,130
对
Yeah.

791
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,400
我一辈子都不会摘下来
I'm never gonna take it off.

792
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,240
喜欢吗
Do you like it?

793
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,500
好看吗
Does it look good?

794
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,630
非常好看
It's beautiful.

795
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,210
谢谢
Thank you.

796
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,210
孩子还有多久会醒
How much time we have till the kids get up?

797
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,680
我才不管孩子呢
I don't care about the kids.

798
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,650
叠罗汉
Pile drive!

799
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:42,890
爸爸  不要  爸爸  别闹了
Daddy, stop! Daddy, stop!

800
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,580
你想睡懒觉  就得被挠痒痒
If you want to sleep in, you have to pay the tickle tax!

801
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,360
挠痒痒
Tickle tax.

802
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,150
好了  亲爱的
All right, come on, honey.

803
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:51,910
该用药...
It's time to take care of...

804
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,040
给
Here you go.

805
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,630
很好
Good.

806
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,350
深呼吸
Big breath.

807
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,410
很好
Good.

808
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,720
你约了人吗
You expecting somebody?

809
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,080
爷爷和奶奶来了
Grandma and Grandpa are here!

810
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,470
我先回房了
I'll be in my room.

811
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,330
妈
Hey, Mom.

812
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,890
米格尔
Hey, Miguel.
