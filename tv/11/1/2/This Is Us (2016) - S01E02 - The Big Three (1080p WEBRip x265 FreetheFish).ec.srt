We'd just bought this house on faith,

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,530
even though it needed a lot of work,

even though we couldn't afford it whatsoever.
��Ȼ���Ǹ�������

Then Randall made partner.
�������¶����˺ϻ���

651
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,590
He did all the work on the house himself,
���ӵ����л�����Լ��ɵ�

652
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,230
so we didn't have to spend a penny.
��������û��һ��Ǯ

653
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,820
And he made sure I didn't lift a finger

654
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,510
during my pregnancy.

He's perfect.

00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,970
Problem is, he stopped sleeping.
��������  ��ʧ����

659
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,850
And then one morning, I was in the bathroom,
��һ������  ����������

660
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:36,830
and he called out to me.

661
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,270
And he was confused, you know?
������  �㶮��

662
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,760
He was confused because he...

00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,320
couldn't see anything.

My husband-- my mountain of a man--
�ҵ��ɷ�  �ҵĿ�ɽ

665
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:56,250
could literally no longer see things through his eyes.

666
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,110
It was as if 28 years of being that perfect
�ͺ���28����������������

667
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,110
had all caught up to him that morning.

668
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,730
And he, um...

669
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,280
he pulled himself out of it.
��������Ǹ�����

670
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,410
He self-corrected,
���Լ��κ����۾�

671
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,460
'cause that's what my man does.
��Ϊ���ɷ������������

672
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:22,240
Randall is not free of vice, William.
���¶�������û��ȱ��  ����

673
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,900
His vice is his goodness.
����ȱ�������������

674
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,910
It's his compulsive drive to be perfect.
��ǿ���Լ���������

675
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,130
It's why I love him...

676
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,670

Ҳ����Ϊ�����ʱ�ҵñ�����

677
