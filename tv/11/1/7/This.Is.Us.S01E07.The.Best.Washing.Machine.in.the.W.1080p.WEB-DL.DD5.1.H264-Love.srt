I'll get ice cream,

and then they'll hate me.

Kate: I can't fall
for a fat person right now.

I guess I'll lose
the weight then.

11

You've done a lot of
really nice things for me,

into little squares

14

Yum.

00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,321
It's working,
all right?

173
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,022
You got to keep
going, though.

174
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:32,724
This is the tough part,
but you got this.

175
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,160
Yeah.

176
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,229
Good job.

Nice work,

All right, Toby,
you ready?

180
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:46,171
Yup.
All right.

181
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:48,774
(Scale beeping)
Okay.
Oh, wow.

182
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,542

Yeah.

what that means?

Hey, guys, guess
who just met their month goal?

187
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,919
Nice. Hey, yeah, Toby, do you
mind if we take a victory pic?

188
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,388
Oh, no, no,
that's not necessary.
No, of course it is.

189
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,223
No, it's no biggie.
You hit your goal.

No.<i> You</i> are no

I-i told you last week.

remembered if you said that.

Oh, I know that I did.
Okay, well,

240
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,081
is there any way
that you can move the meeting

is coming to scout Kevin?

We can do dinner another time.

That was mom?

She's not coming?
What'd she say?
Yeah. Well,

259
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,140
tell Miguel I hope
he feels better soon.

260
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,408
Let me talk to her.
Is Miguel sick?

261
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,476
Let me just talk
to her real quick.

262
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:12,978
Just give me the phone.

263
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,245
Yeah, I'll tell Kevin.
Just put her on speaker.

264
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,447
We can reschedule.

265
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,481

to her before you go.

00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,216
Love you, too. Bye.

267
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,418
Before she...
Let me talk to her for...
Oh. It's Miguel's gout.

268
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,953
Really? I didn't know
they made gout anymore.
Yeah.

269
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,390
So she's not
coming then?
No.

270
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,225
Not coming.
Oh, okay.

271
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,893

272
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,729
It's the two of us.
Yes.

273
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,330
Yeah. I mean, if you got work
to do though, I...

274
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,798
We don't have to go.
No!

275
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,266
I'm, I'm okay.
You're all right?

276
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:38,103
Yeah. Uh, if you've
got lines to learn

277
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:40,872
or something, then we can...
I'm good. I'm up
to speed, so...

are out tonight.

282
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,757
It'll just be you and us ladies.

283
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,292
Nothing for me, thanks.

(Coughs)

285
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,336
You know, my dad had cancer.

286
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,206
Lung.

287
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,676
I didn't want to say anything
'cause, you know,

288
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:21,279
it wasn't exactly
a happy ending for him.

289
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,748
Endings rarely are.

290
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,022
Weed helped.

291
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:35,026
With the appetite,
you know? But...

292
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,961
I just figured
with your history,

293
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,130
I didn't want to bring
that up because of...
No...

294
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:42,133
marijuana doesn't have
the same kind of trigger.

295
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,968
Even my doctor said.

296
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,203
Hmm.

297
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,038
Can't have you going out
in the night

298
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,807

299
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,009
What... what if I was to tell
you I had a little stash?

300
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,978
Then I'd say, woman,
you surprise me.

301
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,814
And I'm not easily surprised.

302
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:57,882
How about I feed
the girls, right?

303
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,584
Get their asses in bed,

304
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:02,087
and bake us up some
special brownies.

305
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:04,355
I like that plan.
You like that?

306
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:05,990
(Chuckles)

307
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,525

309
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:13,064
(Shouting): What do you think?
This place is great, right?
Yeah.

310
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,767

i bro'ed out with Mario Lopez.

311
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,268

314
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,575
Yeah? All right, well, cool.
Let's, uh... do a selfie.

315
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:26,111
Give it to me, I'll take it.
No, no, it's a selfie.

316
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,179
It's a thing.
Right. Got it.

317
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:31,015

318
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,350
Kevin: That's gonna
turn out great.

319
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,785
Thank you.
(Giggles)
I'm suddenly getting

320
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,453
why we came here.
What'd you say?

321
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,255
I said I'm su...

322
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,790
It's a great place!
Yeah!

323
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,558
You're... oh, you
got to walk around.

324
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,794
Yeah, yeah!

325
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,796
Big table.

326
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,531
He's never been here.

327
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:50,101
There he is!
Hey!

328
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,469
Hey, everybody.

329
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,404
Hey, guys.

330
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:56,040
All right.

331
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,876
So, he's got a piece
of egg salad sandwich

332
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:59,477
dangling from his moustache,

333
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,945
riding<i> me</i> about how

334
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,914
I don't take my job seriously.
Yeah.

335
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:06,851
Eventually, I just had to walk
out while he was talking.

336
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:08,987
Jack.

337
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,593

good-bye this morning.

338

Oh...

339

Knock, knock.
Hey, Heather.

340
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,733
Sabatino's?

341
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:23,001
(Sighs)
Best in the city.

342
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,736
Please, I can make
a better meatball sub

521
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,268
to wake up your sister, okay?
All right.

522
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,204
Okay. Night.
Good night.
Good night.

523
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,706
(Laughing):
You...
Was she walking

524
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,941
or was she floating?
(Laughing)

525
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,777
(Laughter)

526
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:50,381
Oh, I feel bad they have to
crowd themselves on my account.

527
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:52,917
I know Annie must be
wanting her room back.

528
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,218
You're not the one who's
cramping anybody's style

529
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,286
in this house.

530
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:57,355
Okay.
My office used to be

531
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:59,123
my haven.

532
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,459
Now, it's Kevin's hamper.

533
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:02,526
(Laughs)

534
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:03,527
(Both laughing)

535
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,595
Yes.

536
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:05,796
I wish he would leave.

537
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,698
(Both laughing)

538
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,303
Compliments of the owner.

539
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:14,138
Thank you very much,
appreciate that.

540
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,706
See? Don't I get
the hookup or what?

541
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,408
I haven't done so
bad for myself, right?

542
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,776
You're the mayor
of free shrimp.

543
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,479
(Chuckles)

544
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:24,482
(Sighs)

545
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,784
All right, so,
how's the play going?

546
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:27,785
Hmm?

547
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,453
The play.
Mm.

548
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,821
It's good.
Ha! See you still

549
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:31,989
working it, Pearson.
Hey!

550
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,291
Donny frickin' Watson.

551
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,792
What's up, man,
how you doing?

552
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:35,826
I'm good,
I'm good.
Yeah?

553
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,128
Oh, man,
i can't stay.

554
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,429
I got to take my
girl to see<i> cats.</i>

555
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:39,664
She even played grizabella
in high school.

556
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,132
It's a whole
thing but...
(Chuckles)

557
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,166
Let's connect soon, yeah?

558
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:43,167
All right,
yeah, yeah, yeah,

559
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:44,168
I'd like that very much.

560
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,236
I'd like that very much.

561
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:46,904
You're looking good.

562
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,005
Donny Watson.

563
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,307
How you guys know each other?

564
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,375
Funny.

565
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:54,912
(Chuckles)

566
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:56,714
What, are you serious?

567
00:21:58,184 --> 00:21:59,950
Yeah.
He...

568
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,286
Played my best friend
on<i> the Manny.</i>

569
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:04,288
Oh!
Yeah.

570
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,356
Out of context...

571
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:06,657
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

572
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,925
I must have
missed that episode.

573
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,867
He was a series regular,
actually, on the show.

574
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:21,605
For four years, he was
a series regular.

575
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,015
Have you ever seen my show?

576
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,383
Of course I have.
Yeah?
Yeah.

577
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:33,517
What was my, uh,

578
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,985
what was my character's name?

579
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,387
Don't tell him.

580
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:37,755
What was my character's name
on the show?

581
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:45,062
(Whispering):
Wow.

582
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,063
(Sighs)

583
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:47,465
(Laughs)
Okay.

584
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,633
Kevin.
No, no, man, it's all right.

585
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:50,735
Just finish the dinner, man.
It's all right,
it's all right,

586
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:51,802
it's all right.

587
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:57,208
Good talk.

588
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:00,978
(Toby laughs)

589
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,581
And so this, uh, dog

590
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,182
just keeps getting
reincarnated.

591
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:07,918
(Laughs)
And so,

592
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,588
and so, it's like he...
I think he's a schna...

593
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,656
Like a schnauzer, like,

594
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:15,359
poodle mix and he's
running around town

595
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:17,862
trying to solve crimes, but he
keeps getting hit by cars.

596
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:19,830
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

597
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:21,265
Thank you.

598
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,433
And did you see
what happened here?

599
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:23,501
You had chicken.

600
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:24,502
I had the chicken.

601
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:25,603
We are in this together.

602
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:26,904
Right?
Thank you.

603
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,439
Would you two like
to see our dessert tray?

604
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:30,374
Uh, no, thank you.

605
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:32,843
Walk away, fine sir.

606
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,178
Hey, wait.

607
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,113
He'll have a look.

608
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,348
I will?

609
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,883
Dude, I know you want it,

610
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:40,885
and if you don't have it here,
you're gonna go home,

611
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:42,353
you're gonna stuff your face and
you're gonna lie to me about it.

612
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:43,721
(Sighs)

613
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:44,855
You'll have a full-on

614
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:45,990
food mistress and I...

615
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,759
But I will never love her

616
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,127
(whispering):
The way that I love you.

617
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:51,562
This is not a joke.

618
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:53,197
I'm being serious.
Okay, all right, okay,

619
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:55,099
okay.
How are we gonna make
this relationship work

620
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,168
if we're gonna keep things
from each other?

621
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:07,011
I'll just have to handle it.

622
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,448
All right.
Okay.

623
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:31,836
(Announcer speaks indistinctly
over speakers)

624
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:35,406
Hold both at
the same time.

625
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:37,441
You made it.

626
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:39,009
Hi.
Hi.

627
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:41,345
(Sighs)

628
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:43,180
What's with, uh,
all the beige?

629
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:44,348
(Chuckles)

630
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,349
I'm trying
to remain neutral.

631
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:46,617
Yeah? Okay.
Yeah.

632
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:47,918
(Chuckles)

633
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:51,489
Wait, where's Kevin?

634
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:52,823
Uh...

635
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:53,858
Oh, there he is.

636
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,925
Twelve.
Twelve.

637
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,594
Down, set, hut.

638
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:01,999
Down, set, hut.

639
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,105
Thank you.

640
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,507
Announcer:
We'd like to welcome tonight's
visiting team, hanes academy.

641
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:10,774
Now, let's go,
McKinley wildcats.

642
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:12,009
Rehearsal?

643
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,177
Rehearsal was good?

644
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,313
Oh, Jack, honestly,
it was amazing.

645
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:17,314
Yeah?

646
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:20,384
Yeah, just being on stage again,

647
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,853
and singing and I missed it.

648
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,822
Yeah.
The smell of the
microphone alone was...

649
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:26,190
The microphone
has a smell?
Hey, Jack!

650
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,191
Hey.

651
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,292
Big game
for Kevin, huh?

652
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:29,693
Yeah, and with your Bobby

653
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,128
opening up holes

654
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,863

Uh, you know, you do the-the...
The... like,<i> the big short.</i>

700
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:21,238
You do the ponzu schemes.

701
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,474
Oh, dude, it's ponzu sauce,
Ponzi schemes.
Whatever.

702
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:26,343
Look, the point is, you don't
know what I do, and that's fine.

703
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,979
What difference does it make
if I didn't watch<i> the Manny?</i>

704
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,982
You hated the show! You were
so ashamed of it, you quit.

705
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:35,019
Not at first. At first, I was
proud of that show, Randall.

706
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:36,620
And I invited every single

707
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:38,922
one of you to tapings.
Kate's the only one that came.

708
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:41,992
Well, she had to.
You were paying her.

709
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,994
Come on, dude. That was funny.

710
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,330
What are you...?

711
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:49,767
(Randall laughs)

712
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:52,803
Now that...
That is funny.

713
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:54,872
That's great.

714
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:57,341
Replaced by another
black man.

715
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,443
What the hell
did you just say?

716
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:01,311
No. "Replaced
by another black man."

717
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:03,147
Hey, you tell me
what that means.
Don't worry about it, Randall.

718
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:04,548
No. Please, Kevin.
Let's hear it, right?

719
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,949
What are you harboring?
'Cause God knows

720
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:07,351
I would really love
to hear this.

721
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,053
You always got
special treatment.

722
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:10,487
Because I'm black?

723
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:11,955
No, because you're black
and you're adopted.

724
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:14,058
Oh, yeah, hit the jackpot
with that combination.

725
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,060
Couldn't have had it any easier.
In our house, you did.

726
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:17,795
With our mother, you did.
Oh, right.

727
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:19,963
Okay, here we go.
Why can't you just
admit it, man?

728
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:21,965
Admit what?
Just admit that you were
more important to her, and that

729
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:24,301
she wanted to make sure that you
felt special every single minute

730
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:25,703
of every single day so that
yeah.

731
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:27,071
You wouldn't feel
like the odd man out.

732
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:28,405
Well, gee, Kevin, I wonder why

733
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:29,740
she was worried
about me feeling that way?

734
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:31,375
What the hell does that mean?

735
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,876
Just go back
to your hotel.
No. No, hold on.

736
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,378
Randall, hold... no.
What does that mean?

737
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,513
It means you treated me
like a dog.

738
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:39,583
And just like a dog, I kept
coming back again and again,

739
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:42,486
just hoping
for a scrap from you,

740
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:46,490
like a crumb of affection
or kindness or respect.

741
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:48,225
Respect? You
wanted my respect?
Yeah.

742
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,527
Yeah, okay. No, you wanted
to show me up, Randall.

743
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:52,329
Which is what you did
every single chance you got.

744
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:54,264
No, I did not.
You showed me up!

745
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:55,566
I'm done with this conversation.

746
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,101
Done with this conversation?
In any other family,

747
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:58,869
I would have
been the star!
Yeah, you know what, bro?

748
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:01,672
You're no star. That is a star.

749
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:03,073
Get your hands off me.
Get your hands off me.

750
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,541
You don't push my body.

751
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:06,043
Don't touch me, okay?
Don't touch me.

752
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:07,711
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?

753
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:09,546
Oh, my God.
Don't put your
hands on my body.

754
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:11,582
(Indistinct grunting
and mumbling)

755
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,851
(Groaning)

756
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:15,853
Is that...
Is that the Manny?

757
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:18,222
Ow! My face...

758
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:20,557
Kevin? Hey, Kevin?

759
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,426
You're all right, man?
Hey, Seth.

760
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,828
Do you... want me
to call someone?

761
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:29,967
Oh. Oh, it's, uh...
(Camera shutter clicks)

762
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:33,070
No.

763
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:34,872
This is my brother.

764
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:36,974
Oh. Hey, man.

765
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:38,442
Hey, Seth meyers.

766
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,244
Okay.
Yeah.

767
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:43,280
(Distant siren wailing)

768
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,783
No. You know what? Let's go.
Yeah.

769
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:47,284
I'm still black.
Come on, let's go.
Yup, yup.

770
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,820
(Grunts)
Let's get the
hell out of here.

771
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,896
I'm sorry I couldn't help more
with moving the heavy stuff.

772
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:02,065
That's okay.

773
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:05,335
Did you know I grew up
in a house with 14 people in it?

774
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:07,738
Hmm.

775
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,476
My parents, four siblings,
aunts, cousins,

776
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,778
three bedrooms.

777
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,614
How many bathrooms?
One.

778
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:19,750
Oh, my gosh,

779
00:30:19,752 --> 00:30:23,487
when I was young, all I did
was dream of living alone.

780
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:27,424
Like some hippie life,
you know?
(Chuckles)

781
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:30,093
Like in some artist
loft downtown.

782
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:34,198
No husband.

783
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,300
Definitely no kids.

784
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:38,168
So what happened?

785
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,803
I met your damn son.

786
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:42,372
(Laughs)
One look in his eyes,

787
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:46,510
he ruined everything.
(Laughs)

788
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:50,814
Me, I pretty much
always lived alone.

789
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:53,851
Hmm.

790
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,285
Now I have Randall.

791
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:57,120
And you.

792
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:59,323
And the girls

793
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:04,294
to fall asleep to,
wake up to every day.

794
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:06,396
I hope that's a good thing.

795
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:08,866
Mostly.

796
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,637
Makes me feel sad to die.

797
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:27,251
I love it when there's
a new moon like this.

798
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:35,058
"Splendid against the
night, the searchlights...

799
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,696
Both:
...The tracers' arcs,
and the red flare of bombs."

800
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:41,431
How do you know that?

801
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:43,734
It's in this book of poems

802
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:47,070
that Randall's had
since he was a baby.

803
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:50,173
(Chuckling):
Oh, yeah, that's right.

804
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:52,342
The one I gave Rebecca
back in the day.

805
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:57,948
Oh.

806
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,183
What?

807
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:02,052
What'd you say?
I'm feeling a little tired,

808
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:03,520
Beth, I think I'll...
Oh,

809
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:04,955
hell no, you ain't
cancering your way

810
00:32:04,957 --> 00:32:06,123
out of this one, old man.

811
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,524
(William stammering)
You better talk.

812
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:14,631
(Warning beeps)

813
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:30,280
(Door chimes)

814
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,116
(Alarm chirps)

815
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:47,731
(Plastic bag rustling)

816
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,739
(Rustling continues)

817
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,249
(Sighs)

818
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:36,179
Get your asses in the car.

819
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,881
We're gonna talk big-time
at home.

820
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:47,124
(Engine starts)

821
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:20,157
You're right.

822
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,925
Mom did favor me.

823
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:26,663
She did.

824
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:28,265
Showered me
with attention.

825
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:29,933
Took my side more
often than not.

826
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,504
And I ate every bit
of her love up.

827
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:37,274
Ate it up like pac-man.

828
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:39,176
(Laughs softly)

829
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:41,244
You know why?

830
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:45,949
Because the one person
i wanted it from the mo...

831
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,226
You know, back there
with those people,

832
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:58,295
it's the first time in 36 years

833
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:00,864
you've said the words,
"he's my brother."

834
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:04,301
Come on, Randall,
that can't be...

835
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:05,902
Claiming me.

836
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,640
My brother.

837
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:25,222
Well, then, that really sucks.

838
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,936
Rebecca has known who you were
for Randall's entire life?

839
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:41,004
Yes, that's right.

840
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:42,806
And she never told him?

841
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,341
I don't know, Beth.
Lied to him,

842
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:46,443
when he asked. Huh.

843
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:47,444
I got to tell him.

844
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:48,445
No. No, no, no, no.

845
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:49,913
Beth, you can't do that.

846
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:51,148
Oh, "Beth you can't do that"?

847
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,916
This is my husband.

848
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:53,984
This is my marriage.

849
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:56,686
I know, but the closeness
he has with his mom,

850
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,922
you tell him this,
it'll destroy it.

851
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:00,490
(Door closes)

852
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,498
Whoa, someone's high.

853
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:15,105
Good night.

854
00:36:15,107 --> 00:36:17,340
Night.
Good night.

855
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:22,345
Uh...

856
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,514
You and my wife
got high together?

857
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,254
That's pretty cool.

858
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:36,293
(Chuckles)
Good for you.

859
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:38,028
All right, I'm gonna
head up to bed.

860
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,530
Not that way;
She moved you.

861
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,599
What do you mean, she moved me?
She moved me where?

862
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:55,545
(Sighs)
(Laughs)

863
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,581
Oh, back in
the basement.

864
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,849
No, we'll move
you back upstairs.
No, come-- hey, listen.

865
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:02,018
I should be getting out of
your hair soon anyway.

866
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,187
You know, until then, this is
actually a pretty sweet set-up.

867
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:05,522
There's no bathroom down here.

868
00:37:05,524 --> 00:37:07,324
I can walk a flight of stairs.

869
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:13,330
(Sighs)
Well, uh... (Clicks tongue)

870
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:14,831
It's been a day.

871
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,933
