1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,010
Previously on This Is Us...

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,290
I love our life.

3
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,760
I love it right now.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,690
And I'm so scared of changing it.

5
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,290
I'm not gonna stand for anything changing between us.

6
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,950
I don't want to be different from them.

7
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,830
Different from who? Who, the kids at school?

8
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,160
If I get an "A," I'll get ice cream,

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,400
and Kate and Kevin won't, and then they'll hate me.

10
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,600
I can't fall for a fat person right now.

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,230
I guess I'll lose the weight then.

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,410
What did I do to deserve this?

13
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,950
You've done a lot of really nice things for me,

14
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,970
so I wand to return the favor.

15
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,900
By cutting up cardboard into little squares

16
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,100
and putting it in a bowl? Yum.

17
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,350
Hey, so, Kevin, uh, it's been a few days now, you know,

18
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,630
since you showed up.

19
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,670
- Without calling. - Right.

20
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,240
I was just sort of wondering...

21
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,260
When are you leaving?

22
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:45,620
Yeah.

23
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,410
Washing machine is officially cooked.

24
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,140
Ah, she's still got some life in her, at least six more cycles.

25
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,500
Jack, we have three infants.

26
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,590
We're gonna be doing six cycles by noon.

27
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,830
- Jack? - Yeah.

28
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,540
Uh, I need your help.

29
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,230
It's leaking everywhere.

30
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,680
This is bail out!

31
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,370
Oh, my God.

32
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,750
This is the best washing machine in the entire world.

33
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,510
I'm actually turned on by this washing machine.

34
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,780
I'm gonna show you turned on.

35
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,320
- Oh, you are? - I am.

36
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,480
- Big Three! - Big Three!

37
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,420
I just want to do a small kitchen remodel.

38
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,130
Just some new cabinets, maybe some new countertops.

39
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,810
给我  兰德尔  那是我的弹力球[蛋蛋]Give me those, Randall, they're my bouncy balls.

40
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,160
But Mom gave them to me.

41
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,930
You said "butt."

42
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,530
You said "balls."

43
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,420
What the hell, Kevin?

44
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,650
Turn the lights out, man, it's 2:00 A.M.

45
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,540
Damn it, Kevin, you ruined it.

46
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:51,910
It's all ruined.

47
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,380
Hey, man, I'm...

48
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,090
I'm sorry, dude.

49
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,600
Don't.

50
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,320
What are you doing?

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,590
I'm trying to help you.

52
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,280
Look, I'm sorry I touched your precious woobie.

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,620
That thing reeks by the way.

54
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,330
It's the blanket I was left in, Kevin.

55
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,530
Well, it doesn't mean you can't wash it once in a while.

56
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,950
- What's your problem? - What's my problem?

57
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,060
Yes, what's your problem?

58
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,470
What's my problem? Dude, it's 2:00 a.M.

59
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,640
- and all the lights are still on! - Hey, guys.

60
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,230
What in the name of God could you possibly

61
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,490
be fighting about right now?

62
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,950
- He threw a football at my face. - He keeps waking me up.

63
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,910
And I need to get sleep because I have a big game tomorrow.

64
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,440
Okay, Kevin, but Randall has a lot of homework,

65
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,580
and now that he's on the football team,

66
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,790
he has a lot less time do do it.

67
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,790
And why does he suddenly need to be on the football team?

68
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,380
What do I have to do with you guys?

69
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,050
Do I have to make you go sleep in separate rooms?

70
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,980
- Yes, actually that'd be great. - You don't have to do that...

71
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,620
Okay, that won't work

72
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,880
because the only empty room in the house

73
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,080
- is the basement. - I want it.

74
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,160
Kevin...

75
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,240
K... would you relax?

76
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,870
Hey. Dude, come on.

77
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,580
You don't have to go into the basement.

78
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,860
I'll turn off my light,

79
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,260
and I'll do my homework in the kitchen.

80
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,140
That's a very nice offer.

81
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,220
Kevin, do you hear what your brother's saying?

82
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Yeah, I heard him.

83
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,430
- Hi, Kevin! - Ashley.

84
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,380
That baby teething?

85
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,790
- You know it. - All right.

86
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,290
Ni hao, Mr. Hwa.

87
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,970
Keep working on that core.

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,910
- Hey. - What's up?

89
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,160
Morning, gentlemen.

90
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,280
- Hey. - Good morning.

91
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,010
Look at this, I got six miles.

92
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,850
- Good for you, buddy. - Yup.

93
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,820
I did eight.

94
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,080
- Is William still asleep? - Yeah.

95
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,880
I feel like yesterday's chemo took a lot out of him.

96
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,120
Morning hugs!

97
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,430
- Give me my morning hug. - No, gross!

98
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,720
Daddy, you're all sweaty.

99
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,720
All right, come on girls,

100
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,060
backpacks, lunches, car.

101
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,010
Let's go. I'll be right out.

102
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,880
- Have a great day, beautifuls. - You too.

103
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,110
- Daddy loves you. - Bye, Dad, love you.

104
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,100
Bye, kiddos.

105
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,530
Hey, Kevin.

106
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,230
Did you see a yellow legal pad in my office?

107
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,280
You mean my bedroom?

108
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,650
Do I though?

109
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,580
All right, I am gonna grab a shower.

110
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,220
- Meet you at the office before dinner. - Yeah.

111
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,820
Look, he and I are having dinner tonight,

112
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,440
so you have a Kevin-free evening.

113
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,600
Just the two of you?

114
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,100
- Alone? - No, we're meeting our mother.

115
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,530
Oh, okay.

116
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,370
Why?

117
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,650
No, I just couldn't imagine you and Kevin hanging out.

118
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,850
What do you... Well, the guy lives in our house, Beth,

119
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,790
we hang out all the time.

120
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,790
Yeah, but you guys are never in the same room alone together.

121
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,730
Uh, we just went for a run together.

122
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,300
Together?

123
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,740
Really?

124
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,500
So, what this mean, "really?"

125

{\an8}圣经故事  该隐杀死弟弟亚伯

126
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,540
It didn't end well for Cain and Abel, baby,

127
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,400
that's all I'm saying.

128
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,670
Well, we're not Cain and Abel.

129
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,250
Well, they were much less repressed.

130
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,580
But if we were Cain and Abel

131
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,470
I'd be Cain, right?

132
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,830
'Cause he's the brother who won?

133
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,780
All right.

134
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,220
- I love you. - Love you.

135
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,440
That was your fastest run yet.

136
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,630
Damn right it was.

137
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,190
Damn right.

- Every ounce counts. - That's true.

144

And I'm crushing this weigh-in.

145
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,320
Get it!

146
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,990
All right, Kate, are you ready?

147
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,760
- I am. - All right. Let's do this.

148
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,110
- Oh, will you hold this for me? - Yeah.

149
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,360
All right. Congratulations, lady.

150
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,840
You are down a pound and a quarter.

151
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,920
A pound?

152
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,800
Yeah, and a... and a quarter.

153
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,830
And a quarter.

154
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,900
Okay, I kill myself for weeks, and I'm down a pound?

155
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,130
- And a quarter. - Right. Yeah.

156
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,970
It's working, all right?

157
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,390
You got to keep going, though.

158
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,340
This is the tough part, but you got this.

159
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,760
Yeah.

160
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,150
Good job.

161
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,370
Down. Down is great.

162
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,890
- Thanks. - Nice work, nice work.

163
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,200
- All right. - All right, Toby, you ready?

164
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,850
Yup. All right.

165
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,480
Okay. Oh, wow.

166
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,020
You lost eight more pounds, mister.

167
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,590
- Yeah. All right. - You know what that means?

168
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,050
Hey, guys, guess who just met their month goal?

169
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,200
This guy!

170
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,360
Nice. Hey, yeah, Toby, do you mind if we take a victory pic?

171
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,030
- Oh, no, no, that's not necessary. - No, of course it is.

172
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,360
- No, it's no biggie. - You hit your goal.

173
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,160
It's no biggie.

174
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,970
No. You are no biggie... anymore.

175
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,090
- Yeah. - I'm proud of you, Toby.

176
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,990
Go, give 'em what they want.

177
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,070
Okay, all right.

178
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,820
Uh, I'll do the...

179
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,480
- I'll do the victory photo. - Yes, let's do it.

180
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,120
All right, we're doing it. All right, guys, let's get in here.

181
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,980
- Victory photo. - Come on, circle it up.

182
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,420
All right, one, two, three.

183
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,170
- Cheese! - Cheese!

184
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,410
Super cute. Another one. Smile!

185
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,250
Yes! Beautiful!

186
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:31,180
{\an8}我们的生活
第一季  第七集

187
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,460
I want to make a big push on rising temp futures.

188
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,050
Some of our clients don't currently believe in science,

189
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,420
but we'll have 'em watch

190
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,820
{\an8}美国副总统戈尔畅销书《难以忽视的真相》同名纪录片  反映全球变暖

191
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,820
an Al Gore documentary once the cash starts rolling in.

192
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,940
Am I right, people?

193
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,020
Come on, guys, nothing? That was...

194
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,310
Is that the Manny?

195
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,500
Yup. That's the Manny.

196
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,440
- I'm early! - Right.

197
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,750
I'll be right there.

198
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,460
You guys look sharp.

199
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,670
I'll meet you in the... meet you in the office.

200
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,470
- Okay. - Cool.

201
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,720
Just chill out in your office?

202
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,580
Yeah.

203
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,520
That is the Manny.

204
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,620
*Straighten up and fly right*

205
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,350
*Straighten up and stay right*

206
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,840
*Straighten up and fly right*

207
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,710
*Cool down, Papa, don't you blow your top*

208
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,890
Sounds good.

209
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,180
- Really? - Yeah.

210
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't remember the last time I was this nervous.

211
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,050
Oh, it's just rehearsal, right?

212
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,510
Yeah, but it's my first rehearsal in ten years.

213
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,140
You're gonna do great, babe.

214
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,670
what are you planning on wearing to the boy's game tonight?

215
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,480
Because I know we usually wear Kevin's colors,

216
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,620
but now that Randall's playing for another school...

217
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,630
The game. Crap.

218
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,510
I'm meeting Bob Parrish tonight

219
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,850
to close the Doylestown deal.

220
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,250
- Doylestown? - Yeah.

221
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,840
Really? So you got it?

222
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,790
I-I told you last week.

223
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,510
Well, I'm sure I would have remembered if you said that.

224
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,450
- Oh, I know that I did. - Okay, well,

225
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,480
is there any way that you can move the meeting

226
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,410
because that coach is coming to scout Kevin?

227
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,120
It's a really big game for him.

228
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,550
It's a big day for me, too, and a big day for you.

229
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,880
And a big day for Kevin, so...

230
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,850
I'll see what I can do.

231
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,250
- Okay. - Okay.

232
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,720
Jack?

233
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,610
Yeah.

234
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,750
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

235
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,050
I'm all over the place.

236
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,050
- Have a good day. - Have fun.

237
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,060
Thanks.

238
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,480
No, of course.

239
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,770
I totally understand. We can do dinner another time.

240
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,870
That was Mom? She's not coming?

241
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,370
- Yeah. - What'd she say?

242
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,360
Well, tell Miguel I hope he feels better soon.

243
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,630
Let me talk to her. Is Miguel sick?

244
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,770
Let me just talk to her.

245
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,320
Just give me the phone.

246
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,080
- Yeah, I'll tell Kevin. - Just put her on speaker.

247
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,130
We can reschedule.

248
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,120
Just let me talk to her before you go.

249
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,370
- Love you, too. - Before she...

250
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,740
- Bye. - Let me talk to her for...

251
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,100
It's Miguel's gout.

252
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,810
Really? I didn't know they made gout anymore.

253
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,280
- So she's not coming then? - No.

254
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,870
- Not coming. - Oh, okay.

255
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,570
- It's the two of us. - Yes.

256
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,570
Yeah. I mean, if you got work to do though,

257
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,510
I... we don't have to go.

258
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,630
- No! I'm, I'm okay. - You're all right?

259
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,370
Yeah. Uh, if you've got lines to learn

260
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,830
or something, then we can...

261
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,910
I'm good. I'm up to speed, so...

262
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,840
You and me.

263
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:40,680
You and I.

264
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,860
Hey, girls, wash up and come down.

265
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,520
So, Kevin and Randall are out tonight.

266
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,760
It'll just be you and us ladies.

267
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,700
Nothing for me, thanks.

268
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,600
You know, my dad had cancer.

269
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,530
Lung.

270
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,010
I didn't want to say anything 'cause, you know,

271
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,500
it wasn't exactly a happy ending for him.

272
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,000
Endings rarely are.

273
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,540
Weed helped.

274
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,870
With the appetite, you know? But...

275
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,150
I just figured with your history,

276
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,290
I didn't want to bring that up because of...

277
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,850
Marijuana doesn't have the same kind of trigger.

278
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,090
Even my doctor said.

279
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,350
Can't have you going out in the night

280
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,010
scoring drugs on my account.

281
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,340
What... what if I was to tell you I had a little stash?

282
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,610
Then I'd say, woman, you surprise me.

283
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,080
And I'm not easily surprised.

284
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,970
How about I feed the girls, right?

285
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,640
Get their asses in bed,

286
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,350
and bake us up some special brownies.

287
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,960
- I like that plan. - You like that?

288
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,650
Right.

289
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,410
Hey! How are you?

290
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,170
- What do you think? This place is great, right? - Yeah.

291
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,070
Yeah. The last time I was here, I bro'ed out with Mario Lopez.

292
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,310
I don't know who that is.

293
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,330
Oh, okay.

294
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,830
Oh, my God. We love you.

295
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,360
Yeah? All right, well, cool. Let's, uh... do a selfie.

296
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,140
- Give it to me, I'll take it. - No, no, it's a selfie.

297
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,520
- It's a thing.  -Right. Got it.

298
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,280
That's gonna turn out great.

299
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,970
- Thank you. - I'm suddenly getting why we came here.

300
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,930
What'd you say?

301
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,280
I said I'm su...

302
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,030
- It's a great place! - Yeah!

303
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,570
You're... Oh, you got to walk around.

304
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,750
Yeah, yeah!

305
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,030
Big table.

306
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,470
He's never been here.

307
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,630
There he is!

308
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,190
Hey, everybody.

309
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,580
Hey, guys.

310
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,200
All right.

311
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,670
So, he's got a piece of egg salad sandwich

312
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,330
dangling from his moustache,

313
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,850
riding me about how

314
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,630
I don't take my job seriously.

315
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,900
Eventually, I just had to walk out while he was talking.

316
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,600
Jack.

317
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,830
I forgot to kiss Rebecca good-bye this morning.

318
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,790
First time in 15 years.

319
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,080
- Knock, knock. - Hey, Heather.

320
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:15,990
Sabatino's?

321
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:16,960
Best in the city.

322
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,540
Please, I can make a better meatball sub

323
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,090
than that, blindfolded.

324
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,820
Is that an offer?

325
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,640
- I need you to sign off on these. - Okay.

326
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,460
Do you have a...

327
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,740
- Here you go. - Thanks. Thanks, Jack.

328
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,460
Here...

329
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,080
- There you go. - And... you missed one.

330
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,910
What would I do without you?

331
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
There you go.

332
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,860
- Thank you. - Okay.

333
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,340
What?

334
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,360
I was playing... Are you...

335
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,440
Took your pen.

336
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,150
Thanks.

337
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,650
Your wife should've got that.

338
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,400
Thank you.

339
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,480
Just...

340
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,360
Hi. I'm so sorry I'm late.

341
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,030
Hey, no, you're not late.

342
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,040
Oh... Oh, my goodness!

343
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,180
Oh, my God.

344
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,520
It's been too long.

345
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,030
Guys, this is...

346
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,620
- Rebecca Malone. - Um... it's Pearson now.

347
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,190
- Oh. Right. - But, hi, hi, Rebecca.

348
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,220
Hi, nice to meet you. Hi.

349
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,820
Thank you so much for thinking of me for this. It really...

350
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,540
- it means a lot. - Are you kidding?

351
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,730
Our manager decided we needed a female vocalist

352
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,730
and I told him it's... it's got to be the girl

353
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,090
I used to play the keys for.

354
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,530
Well, I guess you forgot this girl you used to play keys for

355
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,380
- got old. - Not from where I'm standing.

356
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,130
- Really? - Yeah. Yeah.

357
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,460
- Hey, what do you... you want to jump in? - Yeah.

358
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,170
Yeah, I'm ready. Okay.

359
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,200
One, two,

360
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,100
one, two, three.

361
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,190
*A buzzard took a monkey for a ride in the air*

362
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,920
*Monkey thought that everything was on the square*

363
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,320
*The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back*

364
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,920
*The monkey grabbed his neck and said, now, listen, Jack*

365
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,130
*Straighten up and fly right*

366
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,800
*Straighten up and stay right...*

367
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,780
Hey, you've reached Toby, I can't take your call right now

368
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,770
'cause I'm out saving the world from evil,

369
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,370
or it's Tuesday, and I'm bowling.

370
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,400
Toby out.

371
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,600
Hey, it's me.

372
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,260
Again.

373
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,260
I just...

374
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,670
wanted to apologize for ducking out of the meeting. Again.

375
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,280
Well, not like I've ducked out of previous meetings, I'm...

376
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,530
Please call me.

377
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,470
This is...not expected.

378
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,200
I know you're mad at me,

379
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,760
and I get it. I should have handled myself better.

380
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,250
No, no, no. No, it's fine, it's fine.

381
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,750
I literally just saw that you called.

382
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,040
I've just, I've... I've been busy, is all.

383
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,840
Okay. Good. Yeah.

384
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,170
Can I come in?

385
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,630
Uh... uh, yep.

386
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,880
Yeah. Come on in.

387
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,750
It's the maid's day off.

388
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,280
You binged?

389
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,480
No! What?

390
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,810
This is no big deal.

391
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,230
I just, I hit a goal and I celebrated

392
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,540
by eating some food that I actually like the taste of.

393
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,210
You know, I don't... I don't have an eating problem.

394
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,810
Yeah. Well, you didn't have a problem

395
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,250
eating all this food.

396
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,970
- All right, that's fair. - Listen, Toby.

397
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,550
We can just get back on our program,

398
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,870
like, right now.

399
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,840
Here's the thing.

400
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,350
Depriving myself,

401
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,500
uh... makes me absolutely nuts.

402
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,930
So, I think I'm gonna need to loosen the reins a little bit.

403
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,270
What does that mean, loosen the reins?

404
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,390
That means...

405
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,680
I'm done dieting, Kate.

406
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,770
But I still support you 100%.

407
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,660
How?

408
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,110
Like, we were supposed to do this together?

409
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,620
Or like, I agreed to go out with you

410
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,390
because you were gonna lose the weight for me.

411
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,480
And... and I did.

412
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,040
I lost some of the weight.

413
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,150
And if I gain it back, I will lose it again.

414
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,470
All right? You are not alone in this.

415
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,810
When we are together,

416
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,590
I will eat the way that you eat.

417
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:39,530
I swear. I swear on this bag of Cool Ranch...

418
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,800
which is...

419
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,410
way more disgusting than I remembered, by the way.

420
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,880
I just don't know how this is gonna work.

421
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,830
Then I'll show you.

422
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,910
All right? Tonight.

423
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,220
We'll go to dinner.

424
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,990
We will eat sensibly, hmm?

425
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,550
We will talk as always.

426
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,370
We will laugh as always,

427
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,270
all right? We'll still be us, I promise.

428
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,140
Okay?

429
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,870
Hey, congrats.

430
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,200
Heard you got your own room.

431
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,720
Yeah.

432
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:20,940
What's up with you?

433
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,710
Nothing.

434
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,700
Randall.

435
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,580
Why does he hate me so much?

436
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,530
Kevin doesn't hate you.

437
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,100
You guys are just so intense with each other, you know?

438
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,650
Try lightening things up a little.

439
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,420
Joke around with him more.

440
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,900
You know Mom is gonna kill you if she sees you

441
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,630
putting on all that makeup, right?

442
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,400
Pop-Tarts and Yoo-hoo.

443
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,270
Breakfast of champions.

444
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,340
What do you want?

445
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,690
I just came to see your dungeon.

446
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,780
I mean, your digs.

447
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,480
I think it's cool.

448
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,380
Yeah... totally.

449
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,800
In a couple days you won't notice

450
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,070
that funky mildew, and the asbestos.

451
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,040
I'd give it at least a year till it's imbedded in your lungs.

452
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,700
Randall, can you please just get out of here, man?

453
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,350
Look, I came down here to get away from you.

454
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,430
Dude, I was just joking.

455
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,460
Are you deaf?

456
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,390
I said get out.

457
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,410
Get a life.

458
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,940
You feeling anything yet?

459
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,380
I...

460
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,890
...was I supposed to eat a quarter of the brownie,

461
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,480
or a quarter of the pan?

462
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,200
Yes, definitely.

463
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,770
What? What's so funny?

464
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,840
That's not the answer. It's not...

465
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,900
You did it right.

466
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,640
You ate it.

467
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,370
Shh, don't laugh so loud.

468
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,560
I don't want to wake up the girls, okay?

469
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,060
I knew I smelled chocolate.

470
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,510
Why are you guys eating brownies in the basement?

471
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,080
- Can I have one? - No.

472
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,700
These are adult brownies.

473
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,980
These are work brownies.

474
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,050
Shut up.

475
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,310
Tomorrow, I'm gonna make you some kid's brownies, okay?

476
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,950
- Okay. - All right. Go ahead back upstairs. Go to bed.

477
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,840
And be gentle getting back in that bed. I don't want you

478
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,490
- to wake up your sister, okay? - All right.

479
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,060
- Okay. Good night. - Night.

480
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,710
- Good night.

481
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,010
- You... - Was she walking or was she floating?

482
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,720
I feel bad they have to crowd themselves on my account.

483
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,790
I know Annie must be wanting her room back.

484
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,500
You're not the one who's cramping anybody's style in this house.

485
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,500
- Okay. - My office used to be my haven.

486
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,860
Now, it's Kevin's hamper.

487
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,290
Yes.

488
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,230
I wish he would leave.

489
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,040
Compliments of the owner.

490
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,260
Thank you very much, appreciate that.

491
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,140
See? Don't I get the hookup or what?

492
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,320
I haven't done so bad for myself, right?

493
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,260
You're the mayor of free shrimp.

494
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,530
All right, so, how's the play going?

495
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,110
The play.

496
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,060
- It's good. - See you still working it, Pearson.

497
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,810
Donny frickin' Watson. What's up, man, how you doing?

498
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:25,850
- I'm good, I'm good. - Yeah?

499
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,250
Oh, man, I can't stay. I got to take my girl to see Cats.

500
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,710
她在高中还扮演过葛丽兹贝拉She even played Grizabella in high school.

501
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,710
{\an8}音乐剧《猫》中过气的魅力猫

502
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,290
It's a whole thing but...

503
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,510
let's connect soon, yeah?

504
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,240
All right, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'd like that very much.

505
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,030
I'd like that very much. You're looking good.

506
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,160
Donny Watson.

507
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,440
How you guys know each other?

508
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,320
Funny.

509
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,740
What, are you serious?

510
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,630
- Yeah. - He...

511
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,640
played my best friend on The Manny.

512
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,840
- Out of context... - Yeah.

513
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,150
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I must have missed that episode.

514
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,320
He was a series regular, actually, on the show.

515
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,730
For four years, he was a series regular.

516
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,890
Have you ever seen my show?

517
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:21,830
- Of course I have. - Yeah?

518
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,520
Yeah.

519
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,430
What was my, uh, what was my character's name?

520
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,300
Don't tell him.

521
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,960
What was my character's name on the show?

522
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,280
Okay.

523
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,310
- Kevin. - No, no, man, it's all right.

524
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,650
- Just finish the dinner, man. - It's all right,

525
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,050
it's all right, it's all right.

526
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:46,970
Good talk.

527
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,340
And so this, uh, dog

528
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,280
just keeps getting reincarnated.

529
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,360
And so, and so, it's like he... I think he's a schna...

530
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,200
like a schnauzer, like, poodle mix

531
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,210
and he's running around town trying to solve crimes,

532
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,900
but he keeps getting hit by cars.

533
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,810
- May I?  - Yeah, yeah, thank you.

534
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,190
And did you see what happened here?

535
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,300
You had chicken. I had the chicken.

536
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,690
- We are in this together. - Thank you.

537
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,330
Would you two like to see our dessert tray?

538
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,640
Uh, no, thank you.

539
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,960
- Walk away, fine sir. - Aright.

540
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,140
Hey, wait.

541
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,360
- He'll have a look. - I will?

542
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,850
Dude, I know you want it,

543
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,750
and if you don't have it here,

544
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,370
you're gonna go home, you're gonna stuff your face

545
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,730
and you're gonna lie to me about it.

546
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,300
You'll have a full-on food mistress and I...

547
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,130
But I will never love her the way that I love you.

548
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,580
This is not a joke.

549
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,840
- I'm being serious. - Okay, all right, okay, okay.

550
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,190
How are we gonna make this relationship work

551
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,810
if we're gonna keep things from each other?

552
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,020
I'll just have to handle it.

553
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,220
- All right. - Okay.

554
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,550
- Hold both at the same time. - You made it.

555
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,300
What's with, uh, all the beige?

556
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,100
I'm trying to remain neutral.

557
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,700
- Yeah? Okay. - Yeah.

558
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,340
Wait, where's Kevin?

559
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,210
There he is.

560
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,480
- Twelve. - Twelve.

561
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,080
Down, set, hut.

562
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,000
Down, set, hut.

563
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,650
Thank you.

564
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,930
Now, let's go, McKinley Wildcats.

565
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,670
Rehearsal? Rehearsal was good?

566
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:03,550
Oh, Jack, honestly, it was amazing.

567
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,630
- Yeah? - Yeah,

568
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,940
just being on stage again,

569
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,620
and singing and I missed it.

570
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,710
- Yeah. - The smell of the microphone alone was...

571
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,060
- The microphone has a smell? - Hey, Jack!

572
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,000
Big game for Kevin, huh?

573
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,520
Yeah, and with your Bobby

574
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,820
opening up holes in the backfield,

575
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,570
Kevin's not gonna have to do a whole lot.

576
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,120
All right, folks, McKinley Middle School has possession

577
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,540
with visiting Hanes Academy on defense.

578
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,060
You can finish telling me the rest later.

579
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,850
Down.

580
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,840
Set... hut!

581
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,460
Blue 22!

582
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,880
Blue 42!

583
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,810
Get down, set!

584
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,510
Hut!

585
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,810
- Go, go, go, go! - Go, go, go, go, go!

586
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,160
What are they doing?

587
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,210
All right, all right.

588
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,990
Boys!

589
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,710
Hey. Hey, come on, Kev. Would you stop?

590
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,900
No, it's all right, Randall. I'm just gonna go back to my hotel.

591
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,820
Leave me alone, all right?

592
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,420
Hey, I'll give you a thousand dollars right now

593
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,330
if you can tell me what I do for a living.

594
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,760
- Uh, you're a Wall Street guy, right? - Yeah.

595
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,960
- Yeah. - Okay, but what does that mean?

596
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,800
Uh, you know, you do the-the... the... like, The Big Short.

597
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,920
You do the Ponzu schemes.

598
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,690
Oh, dude, it's ponzu sauce, Ponzi schemes. Whatever.

599
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:13,010
Look, the point is, you don't know what I do, and that's fine.

600
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,630
What difference does it make if I didn't watch The Manny?

601
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,530
You hated the show! You were so ashamed of it, you quit.

602
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:22,200
Not at first. At first, I was proud of that show, Randall.

603
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,740
And I invited every single one of you to tapings.

604
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,220
Kate's the only one that came.

605
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,160
Well, she had to. You were paying her.

606
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,500
Come on, dude. That was funny.

607
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,430
What are you...?

608
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,030
{\an8}《靓男保姆》

609
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,250
Now that... that is funny.

610
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,720
That's great.

611
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,150
Replaced by another black man.

612
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,850
What the hell did you just say?

613
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,600
No. "Replaced by another black man."

614
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,210
Hey, you tell me what that means.

615
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,110
Don't worry about it, Randall.

616
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,400
No. Please, Kevin. Let's hear it, right?

617
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,240
What are you harboring?

618
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,190
'Cause God knows I would really love to hear this.

619
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,520
You always got special treatment.

620
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,060
Because I'm black?

621
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,930
No, because you're black and you're adopted.

622
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,190
Oh, yeah, hit the jackpot with that combination.

623
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,640
- Couldn't have had it any easier. - In our house, you did.

624
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,160
- With our mother, you did. - Oh, right.

625
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,190
- Okay, here we go. - Why can't you just admit it, man?

626
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,220
- Admit what? - Just admit that you were more important to her,

627
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:08,950
and that she wanted to make sure

628
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,220
that you felt special every single minute of every single day

629
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,760
so that, yeah, you wouldn't feel like the odd man out.

630
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,610
Well, gee, Kevin, I wonder why

631
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,270
she was worried about me feeling that way?

632
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,210
What the hell does that mean?

633
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,010
- Just go back to your hotel. - No. No, hold on.

634
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,350
Randall, hold... No. What does that mean?

635
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,750
It means you treated me like a dog.

636
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,170
And just like a dog, I kept coming back again and again,

637
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,640
just hoping for a scrap from you,

638
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,560
like a crumb of affection or kindness or respect.

639
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,520
- Respect? You wanted my respect? - Yeah.

640
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,160
Yeah, okay. No, you wanted to show me up, Randall.

641
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,600
Which is what you did every single chance you got.

642
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,770
- No, I did not. - You showed me up!

643
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,860
I'm done with this conversation.

644
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,510
Done with this conversation? In any other family,

645
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,690
I would have been the star!

646
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,700
Yeah, you know what, bro? You're no star. That is a star.

647
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,760
- Get your hands off me. - Get your hands off me.

648
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:50,850
You don't push my body.

649
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:51,950
- Don't touch me, okay? - Don't touch me.

650
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,330
- What is wrong with you? - What is wrong with you?

651
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,040
Oh, my God. Don't put your hands on my body.

652
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,100
Is that... is that the Manny?

653
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,140
Ow! My face...

654
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,340
Kevin? Hey, Kevin?

655
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,550
You're all right, man?

656
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,170
Do you... want me to call someone?

657
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,030
Oh. Oh, it's, uh...

658
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,120
No.

659
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,220
This is my brother.

660
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,330
Oh. Hey, man.

661
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,070
Hey, Seth Meyers.

662
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,660
- Okay. - Yeah.

663
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,800
No. You know what? Let's go.

664
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,160
I'm still black. Come on, let's go.

665
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,130
Let's get the hell out of here.

666
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,720
I'm sorry I couldn't help more with moving the heavy stuff.

667
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,100
That's okay.

668
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,260
Did you know I grew up in a house with 14 people in it?

669
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,130
My parents, four siblings,

670
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,710
aunts, cousins,

671
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,150
three bedrooms.

672
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,120
- How many bathrooms? - One.

673
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,360
Oh, my gosh,

674
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,680
when I was young, all I did was dream of living alone.

675
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,160
Like some hippie life, you know?

676
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,770
Like in some artist loft downtown.

677
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,880
No husband.

678
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,540
Definitely no kids.

679
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,700
So what happened?

680
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,540
I met your damn son.

681
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,620
One look in his eyes,

682
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,870
he ruined everything.

683
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,570
Me, I pretty much always lived alone.

684
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,620
Now I have Randall.

685
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,000
And you.

686
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:41,760
And the girls

687
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,880
to fall asleep to, wake up to every day.

688
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,110
I hope that's a good thing.

689
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,200
Mostly.

690
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,680
Makes me feel sad to die.

691
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,250
I love it when there's a new moon like this.

692
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:17,290
Splendid against the night, the searchlights...

693
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,220
the tracers' arcs, and the red flare of bombs.

694
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,190
How do you know that?

695
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,440
It's in this book of poems

696
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,860
that Randall's had since he was a baby.

697
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,860
Oh, yeah, that's right.

698
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,020
The one I gave Rebecca back in the day.

699
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,540
What?

700
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:44,780
- What'd you say? - I'm feeling a little tired,

701
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,840
Beth, I think I'll...

702
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,310
Hell no, you ain't cancering your way out of this one, old man.

703
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,110
- Beth... -You better talk.

704
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,740
Get your asses in the car.

705
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:20,510
We're gonna talk big-time at home.

706
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,370
You're right.

707
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,190
Mom did favor me.

708
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,790
She did.

709
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:10,230
Showered me with attention.

710
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,290
Took my side more often than not.

711
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,440
And I ate every bit of her love up.

712
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,540
Ate it up like Pac-Man.

713
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,280
You know why?

714
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,390
Because the one person I wanted it from the mo...

715
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,500
You know, back there with those people,

716
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,250
it's the first time in 36 years

717
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,230
you've said the words, "He's my brother."

718
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,560
Come on, Randall, that can't be...

719
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,170
Claiming me.

720
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,730
My brother.

721
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,210
Well, then, that really sucks.

722
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:19,000
Rebecca has known who you were for Randall's entire life?

723
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,150
Yes, that's right.

724
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,690
And she never told him?

725
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:25,290
- I don't know, Beth. - Lied to him, when he asked.

726
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,470
- I got to tell him. - No. No, no, no, no.

727
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,520
Beth, you can't do that.

728
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,080
Oh, "Beth you can't do that"?

729
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,500
This is my husband.

730
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,880
This is my marriage.

731
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,850
I know, but the closeness he has with his mom,

732
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,250
you tell him this, it'll destroy it.

733
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,580
Whoa, someone's high.

734
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,590
Good night.

735
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,440
- Night. - Good night.

736
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,820
You and my wife got high together?

737
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,480
That's pretty cool.

738
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,440
Good for you.

739
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,770
All right, I'm gonna head up to bed.

740
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,530
Not that way; she moved you.

741
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,470
What do you mean, she moved me? She moved me where?

742
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,870
Oh, back in the basement.

743
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,820
- No, we'll move you back upstairs. - No, come-- hey, listen.

744
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,800
I should be getting out of your hair soon anyway.

745
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,940
You know, until then, this is actually a pretty sweet set-up.

746
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,190
There's no bathroom down here.

747
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,030
I can walk a flight of stairs.

748
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,760
Well, uh...

749
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,420
It's been a day.

750
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,430
Yeah.

751
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,820
Night.

752
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,500
Night.

753
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,730
Hey, uh, Randall.

754
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,800
Uh, do you want to...

755
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,790
Do you want to hang out down here for little bit with me?

756
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,940
We could, uh, turn the TV on or something.

757
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,070
For a little while.

758
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,850
- Yeah? - Why not?

759
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,920
- Cool. - Yeah.

760
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,230
Uh, Rebecca, this is Beth.

761
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,150
Yeah, um, so William just told me something really interesting

762
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,880
about the two of you.

763
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:44,320
So, yeah, I'm gonna need you to call me back, okay?

764
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,450
Right away.

765
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,460
As soon as you get this message.

766
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,160
Okay, bye.

767
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,320
Manny's gonna buy you a mockingbird.

768
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,850
You hate me, don't you?

769
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,000
You want me to open up that big bottle of wine

770
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:06,070
you've been saving for ten years.

771
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,850
Manny say, "What?!"

772
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,340
Hey, you never finished telling me about your rehearsal.

773
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,470
It's okay; I'm tired.

774
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,930
We can talk about it tomorrow.

775
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,050
Okay.

776
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,900
Hey, can you turn the light out, babe?

777
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,390
I just realized we didn't eat dinner tonight, Jack.

778
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,100
I had a pretty big lunch; I'm good.

779
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,380
Well, I'm gonna go make myself something then.

780
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,380
The light, babe.

781
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,900
Mom!

782
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,330
What?

783
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,870
I can't turn the washing machine off.

784
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:41,830
I think it's possessed.

785
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,450
Kev, you know you can always

786
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,720
go back to your old room with Randall.

787
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:15,710
Oh, my God.

788
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,970
This is the best washing machine in the whole world.

789
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,110
I'm actually,

790
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,980
I'm turned on by this washing machine.

791
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,320
Well, I can show you turned on.

792
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,620
Jack, help.

793
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,250
It's leaking everywhere!

794
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,070
Kids, get the buckets.

795
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,530
Okay.

796
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,510
This is bail out!

797
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,460
Okay, kids.

798
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,290
Washing machine is officially cooked, baby.

799
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:45,460
Nah, she's still got some life in her.

800
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,360
At least six more cycles.

801
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,830
Jack, we have three infants.

802
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,890
We're going to be doing six cycles by noon.

803
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:53,470
We can do it. You wash and I'll fold.

804
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,690
Baby, one day, I'm gonna buy you

805
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,480
the best washing machine in the world.
