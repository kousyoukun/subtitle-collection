00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,725
Hey.
Hi.

179
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:00,992
Breakfast in bed?

180
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,327
Yeah.

181
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,995
What did I do to deserve this?

182
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,664
I don't know.

183
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,299
You've done a lot of really
nice things for me,

184
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:09,401
so I wanted to return the favor.

185
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:11,870
Oh. By cutting up cardboard
into little squares

186
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,138
and putting it in a bowl?

187
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,373
Those are cheese squares.

188
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,875
Oh, yum.
Hmm.

189
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,076
Yeah. What's on top?

190
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,311
Oh, hemp seed.

191
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:20,746
Hemp seeds on top?

192
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:21,880
Mm-hmm.

193
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,482
Boy, you really buried the lede.

194
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,217
(Chuckles)
Now I'm in.

195
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,385
(Laughs)
What? You're not

196
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:28,854
gonna have any
nonsense made-up food?

197
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:32,190
No. Getting weighed at
our meeting this afternoon.

198
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,259
You know what?

199
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,595
So am I.

200
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,897
I probably shouldn't eat,
either. Damn.

201
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,666
Mm-hmm.
Hey, what do you want
to do after the meeting?

202
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,935
I was thinking miniature
golf. Last time,

203
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,037
I was like, 20 under
going into the 18th,

204
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,506
but that little windmill

205
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:50,342
owns my ass.

206
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:52,244
I can't. Steelers.

207
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,512
<i> Sunday night football. </i>
Hmm.

208
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:54,880
(Quietly):
Saturday night football.

209
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:55,881
With who?

210
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,416
Oh, no one. Just me.

211
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:59,351
All right. I'll watch with you.
Oh, no.

212
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:01,620
Thanks, but I'm good.

213
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,523
Seriously?

214
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,925
You'd rather watch by yourself
than watch with me?

215
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,927
Yeah. It's my thing.

216
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,962
I have a little ritual.
You know? It's my thing.

217
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,198
Well, your thing...

218
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,433
Is sad.

219
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,535
Not to me.

220
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:17,736
(Sighing):
Okay.

221
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:18,937
Okay. How about this?

222
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,472
You can watch football...

223
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:21,973
All by yourself,

224
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,943
which is totally normal,
but with me.

225
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,611
Toby.
Hmm?

226
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,780
This is something
that I do alone. Okay?

227
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,817
Sure.

228
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,152
Great. Thank you
for being so sweet.
Yeah.

229
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:39,324

Thank, God. Can we please
watch the game now?

242
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:16,161
Pat summerall:
The rose bowl is back.

243
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,630
Not an empty seat anywhere.

244
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:19,798
Jack:
Hey.

245
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,666
Rebecca: Excuse me.
That was amazing.

246
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,767
Ah, yeah? Really?
Yeah.

247
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,035
Rebecca:
Oh! Shelly, Miguel.

248
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,704
There they are. Hey!
Jack: Yeah.

249
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:27,172
So sorry we're late.
It's okay.

250
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,473
Yeah.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

251
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:29,841
Miguel: Damn, kids, man.
Yeah, we were

252
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,042
just about to
head out the door,

253
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,611
and the baby decides
to projective vomit

254
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:33,979
all over little Andy.
Yeah.

255
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,814
Almost got me, too.
So, what does Andy do?

256
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,215
You know, four years old.
Built like a tank.

257
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:38,483
He slaps the baby.

258
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,151
(Gasps)
Right across the face. Pow!

259
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,287
No! Is she okay?
Oh, she's fine. Yeah.

260
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,189
But then the baby's screaming
bloody murder, I'm screaming

261
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,157
at Andy, and me, standing there,
covered in vomit, and I'm like,

262
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,559
Andy, she is a baby.

263
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:49,060
Like, you literally
slapped a baby.

264
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,362
Which really helped,
as you can imagine.

265
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,163
Shelly: Of course,
then Andy starts crying,

266
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,232
baby's crying,
babysitter's crying.
Miguel: We need drinks!

267
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,667
<i> We</i> need drinks.
We'll be right back.

268
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:56,968
Rebecca:
Okay.

269
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,070
Wow.

270
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:02,040
Promise me we are
never having kids.

271
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,475
(Groans)

272
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,010
I think it's time
for shots.

273
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,511
TV sports announcer:
Somebody's down.

274
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:09,047
Announcer 2:
26 is having a tough day.

277
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,595
Announcer: The first half,
the rams, surprisingly,

278
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:26,831
lead Pittsburgh 13 to ten.
Miguel: Pathetic.

279
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,166
Can't stop the run.

280
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,534
Oh, and bradshaw sucks!

281
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,036
Oh, no, bradshaw's
gonna have

282
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,837
a huge second half,
though. Right, babe?

283
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,307
Yeah. Big...
Big second half.

284
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,645
Are you okay?

285
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:43,582
Mm. Fine.

286
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,784
Okay.

287
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,954
Actually, no.

288
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:52,390
Um, what did you mean before
when, uh...

289
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,892
When you said...

290
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:56,394
(Chuckles): "Promise me
we'll never have kids"?

291
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,530
(Chuckles):
Oh. I shouldn't have said that.

292
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,231
Yeah, but... you did.

293
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,233
Kind of said it
twice today.

294
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,269
And I shouldn't have.

295
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,370
Okay?

296
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,138
Sorry.

297
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,573
You know what we
need to be doing?

298
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:09,808
We need to be feeding

299
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,710
the ball to Franco
more, right?

300
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:15,046
That's...
'Cause we-we never
really talk about it.

301
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,750
And I don't want to talk
about it now, either.

302
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:21,152
We always say we're gonna talk
about it in the future,

303
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:24,489
but it's the future now,
bec, and I want kids.

304
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,991
Shelley: You know
what, we're gonna

305
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:28,226
go grab another drink
at the bar.
Okay.

306
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,794
Sports announcer:
...And see how the fans...

307
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,096
Let's go to the ginger man
and Paul hornung.
(Sighs)

308
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:32,831
L.A. fans have
to be happy, Paul.

309
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,165
Beth:
<i> Bedtimes are at 8:00</i>

310
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,501
and 9:00-- that's teeth
brushed, in the bed.

311
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,070
8:00 and 9:00.
So one Sambuca
to chase down the Ambien,

312
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,305
and then lights out, right?

313
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,741
That's too far.

314
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:44,075
Okay, listen, relax.

315
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,176
We're gonna have a nice,

316
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,311
quiet evening at home. Okay?

317
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,912
The girls are gonna play.

318
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,581
I'm gonna memorize my lines
and get off book.

319
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,516
Look, we want to make it clear
that we're not normally

320
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,118
in the habit of leaving
the girls overnight.

321
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,420
Let alone with two men
who probably haven't been

322
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:56,454
around kids that much.

323
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,789
One of them's best known

324
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,591
for leaving a kid
at a fire station.

325
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:00,959
Oh, my God, please,
take care of my babies.

326
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,494
And, please, don't call us.

327
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,162
No, no, call us if you need us.
But don't need us.

328
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,497
Oh, one more thing,
though, before you go.

329
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:06,831
So, Tess was the, uh,

330
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,466
the white wine drinker, right?

331
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,368
Annie likes the red
'cause I don't get that wrong.

332
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,137
Piss them off.
(Under breath): Thanks.

333
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,838
It's still too far.
I can tell by the way you...

334
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,040
Yes.
It's a little too far.

335
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,508
He plays too much.
It's okay.

336
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,809
It's okay.
He plays too much.

337
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,177
Hey, call us if
you need anything.

338
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,079
(Whispering):
Don't call us.

339
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:27,619
So, I have, you know, this-this
issue with-with cracker control,

340
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,854
so what I've been finding
to be really helpful
(Mouthing)

341
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,489
Is if I...

342
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:32,657
Take the portion

343
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,059
out of the box

344
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:36,628
and then I put the portion
onto the plate

345
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,529
and then I put the box
(Whispering): Just pass it.

346
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,798
Away... and then I know...

347
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,667
How... how many crackers

348
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,736
I'm allowed to-to have.

349
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,204
(Whispering):
Just pass it.

350
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,073
To h... to have,

351
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,075
so then I know that if-if
I'm only allowed

352
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,843
to have ten crackers,

353
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,311
then I have the ten
crackers on my plate,

354
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,480
which is fine,
but at the same time,

355
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,716
there are other crackers
that I like than-than

356
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,184
other crackers.
So, I might not like

357
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,985
saltine crackers
as much as I like

358
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:01,986
a cheez-it type cracker,

359
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,422
but so, what I'll do

360
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:05,857
with the cheez-it
type cracker

361
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,093
is maybe put a little bit
more on the plate,

362
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:10,161
but I'm still rationing,
so if I have a saltine,

363
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,063
then I might put
ten on the plate,

364
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,832
but there might be 20
if it's a cheez-it.
(Mouthing)

365
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,667
But I still put the box away.
So, i-i mean

366
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,068
i-i think that's...
That's a win.

367
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,137
Man: Yeah.
(Applause)

368
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,776
(Mouthing)

369
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,950
She was always away on business.

370
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,753
So, I was used to being alone
but this, you know, this...

371
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,721
But this was a different kind
of alone. She was always away

372
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,723
on business, so i
was used to being...

373
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:41,259
But...
So, I was...

374
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,794
She was always away on business,
so I was used to being alone,

375
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,395
but this was a different
kind of alone.

376
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,397
You know? This-this...
Is a different kind of...

377
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,365
I thought you two
were watching a movie.

378
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,466
We want to have

379
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:49,868
a Barbie fashion show.

380
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,202
Oh, cool.
That sounds fun.

381
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:52,771
So, go play Barbie
fashion show.

382
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,973
We need you to be
the celebrity judge.

383
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:55,974
Right.

384
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:58,143
Uh, the thing is I can't

385
00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,878
because I got this
rehearsal tomorrow

386
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,212
and I really want
to be off book, so...

387
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,380
What does "off book" mean?

388
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,048
Off book. Off book means, uh,

389
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,216
means that I know my lines.

390
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,918
So, uh, you, uh...

391
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,153
Have grandpa
be the judge.

392
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,721
Grandpa's not
a celebrity.

393
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:10,722
Yeah.

394
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:13,458
Their logic seems sound.

395
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,660
Thank you.

396
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,396
Okay. Um... tell you what?
You want to,

397
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,397
you want to help me?
You want to,

398
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,565
you want to read
the play with me?

399
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:21,833
Okay.
Yeah. Oh,
come on.

400
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:22,834
Okay.
Yeah, let's do that.

401
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,302
Come on, over here. William,

402
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,603
let's do it.
I'm not much of an actor.

403
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:26,638
Oh, doesn't matter. I just need

404
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,406
to get the lines down, so...

405
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,074
All right, Tess,
we'll start with you.

406
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,744
Uh, you're gonna be Jessica,
David's wife.

407
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,946
Why does she get
to be Jessica?

408
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,614
(Chuckles)
Well, um, be...

409
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,950
Oh, because you're Gracie, okay?

410
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,985
Gracie's Jessica's mom,
which is kind of cool.

411
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,453
It means you get to boss your
sister around.

412
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:43,922
How's that sound?

413
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:46,658
So. William, multiple questions.

414
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,092
First one,
I'm not gonna lie to you,

415
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,562
it's a little
delicate.
Go ahead.

416
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,431
Do you know how to read?

417
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,867
Yes, I can read.

418
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:58,002
I knew it. I was joking.

419
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,771
Of course you know how to read.
(Chuckles)

420
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:01,940
Trying to be funny.
Okay. So if you

421
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:05,210
could please read
the role of Brad.

422
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:08,012
Terrific, okay.
Whoa, where we going?

423
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,347
I have to pee.

424
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,282
Oh, I kind of do, too.

425
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,384
What are you... oh, good God.
(Chuckles)

426
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,763
Mm.

427
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,505
Now, this is what

428
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,708
I'm talking about.

429
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,176
Okay, babe,
here's the plan.

430
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:39,510
Sex first.

431
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:40,912
Right away.

432
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:42,513
Loud, adult,

433
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,249
no kids in the next room sex.

434
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:46,417
And it doesn't have to be
marathon sex.

435
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:49,587
We just need
to get the job done.

436
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,090
And under no circumstances
are we allowed

437
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:54,259
to fall asleep afterwards
watching<i> house hunters.</i>

438
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:57,195
Don't want to miss the whole
night sleeping. Right?

439
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:58,930
Ooh.

440
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,366
We'll do it
in the shower.

441
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:02,867
That's good.

442
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,869
Won't fall asleep
in the big fancy shower.

443
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:08,373
And we'll order
room service before.

444
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,542
That way we will finish
our loud adult shower sex

445
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,579
just as room service arrives
and we will slip on robes

446
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,382
and eat burgers...
No, wait-- spaghetti.

447
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,017
No, I like burgers better.

448
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:22,253
We will eat burgers in bed.

449
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,088
Ooh.

450
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,058
Oh. Now, the big question is...

451
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,094
What to order on pay-per-view.

452
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,630
Oh, I already hope they,
uh, I hope they have that

453
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:35,300
huge grant-meryl streep movie
that sounds like a black lady.

454
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:38,102
Come on.
<i> Florence foster Jenkins.</i>

455
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,038
Baby, they already got
<i> Florence foster Jenkins.</i>

456
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,439
I'm late.

457
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:49,213
I'm a week and a half late,
Randall,

458
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,983
and I feel like crap.

459
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:55,053
And I was chewing on ice
all day yesterday

460
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:57,488
and I almost threw up
when I looked at pizza

461
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,425
and I cannot bring myself
to go to the drugstore

462
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,794
and get a pregnancy test.

463
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,897
I'm bugging out, baby.

464
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,733
I need you to talk me down.

465
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:11,569
Oh.

466
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:12,770
Hey, how are you?
Hey, good.

467
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,772
Come on in.
We got carrots, celery,

468
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,975
broccoli, no dip.
You're welcome.

469
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,643
Thank you, that's so nice.

470
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,645
Oh, and, uh, Kate,
this is my good friend, shooter.

471
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,947
Shooter, Kate.
Hey.

472
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:26,084
Nice to finally meet you, Kate.
Hi. Nice to meet you, too.

473
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,286
Great news.
You both love sports, so...

474
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,488
Sports party.

475
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,958
Al Michaels:
...And the Kansas City chiefs
on<i> Sunday night football.</i>

476
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,793
Commentator:
Bradshaw drops back.

477
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,528
Bradshaw's got time...

478
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,364
(Crowd exclaims)

479
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,767
So, what do you think, Jack?

480
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,569
Looking like it's gonna come
down to the fourth quarter.

481
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:53,978
You want to do this now?
Okay. Let's do it.

482
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,481
So...

483
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:59,650
I am not enough for you.

484
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,886
Am I not enough
for you, Jack?

485
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,821
Okay, back to the bar?
Yup.

486
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,990
I never said that. I just meant

487
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,659
we need to have this
conversation at some point.
Okay.

488
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,962
And you want to do that
right now, at froggy's

489
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:13,031
during the super bowl?
Yes, please
don't make us

490
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,533
miss a second of your drama.
Could you butt out?

491
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,136
Hey...

492
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,071
Babe,

493
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,206
<i> we</i> joke about it.

494
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,308
<i>We</i> see people with kids and go,

495
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,743
"oh, thank God that's not us."

496
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,812
<i> We</i> joke about
it. Right?

497
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:29,380
Did I not
get the joke?

498
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,049
I'm not...

499
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,483
Babe, you're right.

500
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:33,918
You are right.

501
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,354
And coming from the family
that-that I did,

502
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:39,023
I definitely never
saw myself having kids.

503
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,492
Okay.
But then I met you.

504
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:45,196
And, you know,
we're j... we're great together

505
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:47,765
and I love our life.

506
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,667
But the older we get,

507
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,836
the more I think that...

508
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:54,105
The more I think there's
got to be something bigger

509
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:58,009
than just me and you.

510
00:17:58,011 --> 00:18:00,511
Well, thank you very much
for involving me

511
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:04,348
in this huge
invisible change of yours. Huge.

512
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,085
Because you knew when you met me
and married me

513
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,520
that I did not want to be
one of those women

514
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,522
whose sole purpose in life
was to be a mother.

515
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:14,692
If that's what you wanted,
you should have married my mom.

516
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,761
I was thinking more your sister.

517
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,596
Oh. You probably were.

518
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:22,133
I'm... it's a bad joke.
I'm not there yet, Jack.

519
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24,035
I'm not there yet.

520
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:27,105
I am only 29.
Almost 30.

521
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:30,475
I know how old I am!
Hey, sid and Nancy, will
you two take it outside?

522
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,410
Could you just shut up
for a second?
Mind your business.

523
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:34,278
None of us can hear the game
over your mouth.

524
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,880
Wow.
You got to learn
some manners, pal.

525
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,582
You need to control your woman.

526
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:39,217
You need to watch your mouth.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

527
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,718
Jack, sit down.

528
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,719
Come here.
It's not

529
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:42,720
worth it.

530
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,388
Jack, sit down, please.

531
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,723
Jack.

532
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,758
(Grunts)

533
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,660
God, Jack.
Jack! Jack.

534
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,462
No! No, no, no, no.

535
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,831
(Indistinct chatter)

536
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,933
Yeah,

537
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,235
we should really be having kids.

538
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:08,880
(Low, indistinct conversations)

539
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,493
Aren't you gonna
say anything?

540
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:29,700
Uh, yeah. Like, how?

541
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,436
You take the pill every day
like clockwork, right?
Yeah.

542
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,372
What, did I accidentally drop
one in my shake or something?

543
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:36,307
No. I...

544
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,842
I mean, I changed
medications last month

545
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,844
and there might have been,
like, a brief window.

546
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,078
A brief window?

547
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:43,881
Sorry.

548
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,516
A brief window, Beth?

549
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,118
Did it not occur to you that
that might be something

550
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,553
you want to run by your husband?
Well,

551
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:49,554
I didn't know it was
gonna be a problem.

552
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:51,689
Well, there goes Charleston.

553
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,525
Okay, I'm sorry, what?

554
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,128
Ten years from now, when the
girls are both off at college,

555
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,298
I thought that we would take an
early retirement in Charleston.

556
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,200
Oh, forgive me, Randall,

557
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,068
but what in the holy hell
are you talking about?

558
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,736
Since when do you want
to move to Charleston?

559
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,738
I saw something about it
on CNN.

560
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,974
Like, they got a great quality
of life, good restaurants.

561
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:14,979
Sometimes at work,
i look up places on zillow.

562
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:18,649
Oh, okay. Well, I'm so sorry
that I'm screwing with

563
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,651
your super top secret
Charleston dream, honey.

564
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,887
No, my issues are nothing
compared to yours.

565
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,189
Nobody's saying that.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
here's a riddle--

566
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:28,526
who has two hands and was about
to go back to work full-time

567
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:30,528
and maybe,<i> maybe... </i>
Start to remember who she was?

568
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,029
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

569
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:33,698
But now will
have to split her time

570
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,535
between a diaper station
and a home office?

571
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:39,537
This girl, right here.

572
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,339
It's two thumbs.
What?

573
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:43,040
You're doing it wrong.
You're supposed to say

574
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,742
"what has two thumbs and is
mm-mmm, mm-mmm.

575
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,910
Gonna be splitting
time betw..."
Shut up.

576
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,912
Okay, that's real nice, Beth.

577
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,849
Hey.

578
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,818
Also, some altoids.
Please.

579
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,887
Shooter:
Look at that picture.

580
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,522
That is a vivid picture.

581
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:00,124
I feel like I'm at the game.

582
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:02,927
Announcer:
Over across the field, here.

583
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,029
Yeah. It's a really nice TV...

584
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,397
What is this?

585
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:07,898
Plasma?

586
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,200
Led?

587
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:11,402
You know, I'm really
not sure, but...

588
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:12,403
Hey, Toby!

589
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:13,404
Toby:
Yeah?

590
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,472
Uh, do you guys like

591
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,274
jicama?
Plasma or led?

592
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,209
Toby:
I...

593
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:19,910
Have no idea.

594
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,078
Kate? Jicama?
What?

595
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,313
Is that a vegetable or a fruit?

596
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:25,116
Can... can you actually
just move, tob?

597
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,218
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep.

598
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,153
Announcer:
The receiver's all set.

599
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,455
To the right,
Ben looks straight

600
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,457
over the middle,
and going for the end zone!

601
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,492
(TV beeps)
Toby:
Hey.

602
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:36,060
Shooter, uh, tell Kate

603
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:37,495
about that time we accidentally

604
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,597
went to an
Ashlee Simpson concert.

605
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,731
(Laughing):
Oh...
(Toby laughing)

606
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:41,999
Uh, you got to hear this.

607
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,234
So, we were trying to...
I'm sorry.

608
00:21:43,236 --> 00:21:44,435
Toby, you paused the TV.

609
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:45,670
It's like, paused.

610
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:46,971
Yeah, just for a second.
Listen to this.

611
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:47,972
No, this is a great story.

612
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,607
No. O-okay,

613
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,575
I know it's not a big deal,
really,

614
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,244
but I kind of like to
watch sports

615
00:21:53,246 --> 00:21:54,345
as they happen live.

616
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:55,746
Probably just me, right?

617
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,682
Okay. Okay. Here we go.
I don't know.

618
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:59,684
Announcer: ...Tends to wait...
Now we're behind the game!

619
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:01,352
Fast forward it!

620
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:03,854
Announcer:
Touch down!

621
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,990
And heyward made it all alone
down the left side...

622
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:06,857
That's great.
That's your team, right?

623
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:07,858
That's my fantasy team.

624
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,327
What's that?
You know what,

625
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,494
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

626
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,696
I'm actually not feeling good.

627
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:12,863
I'm gonna go
ahead and go.

628
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,265
Oh, no!
Yeah...

629
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:15,266
Are you sure?

630
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:16,534
Yeah.
No, Kate, stay.

631
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:17,802
Shooter...

632
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:19,370
It was really nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

633
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:20,604
What... wait, wait, wait.
Seriously,

634
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:21,839
thank you for the jicama.
What...

635
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,040
I'll talk to you later.

636
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,443
What is happening?

637
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:26,844
You have to let her go, David.

638
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,112
This is crazy, man.

639
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:29,947
She's gone and she's never
coming back.

640
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,650
Whew.
(Scoffs)

641
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:34,285
You really never acted before?

642
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:35,453
Nope.

643
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:36,487
Voice like silk.

644
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:39,190
(Chuckles)
Yeah.

645
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:42,526
How am I supposed to move on,
David?

646
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:43,828
No. I'm David.

647
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,030
How am I supposed to
move on, Brad?

648
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,532
And who made you the expert
of moving on?

649
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,468
Or the expert of anything
for that matter?

650
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:53,437
Is that how you're gonna do it?

651
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:55,906
No.

652
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,208
Good.

653
00:22:58,244 --> 00:22:59,643
It's your line. Uh,

654
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:00,911
Tess, honey, you have
the next line,
uh...

655
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,813
Pay attention.
I-I'd rather

656
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:04,315
you not move on. I'm--

657
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:07,551
I'm obv-- I'm obviously
not planning to.

658
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:08,652
It's not good.

659
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:10,054
Not as easy
as it looks, is it?

660
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,422
No.
No. Okay.

661
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:13,224
There she is! Do you see her?

662
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:14,692
Who, David?
Did I see who?

663
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:15,893
Her! She's right there.

664
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:16,894
And ever since she died,

665
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,062
her ghost has been haunting me.

666
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,430
Hold up.

667
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,732
What's the matter, sweetheart?

668
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,834
What's happening
in this story?

669
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:25,936
You're not following the story?

670
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:30,007
Do you follow it?

671
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,709
Of course.
Yes, of course I follow it.

672
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:33,043
Um... (Muttering)

673
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,378
Mm-hmm.
She died, right?

674
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,513
She's dead.

675
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:37,348
But she keeps coming back
as a ghost.

676
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,517
So when you die
you become a ghost?

677
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,085
No.

678
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,754
No, no, no, no, no. No.
Sweetheart, ghosts aren't real.

679
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:47,291
So what happens when you die?

680
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:52,229
What happens when you die?

681
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:55,966
Uh, is... you die.

682
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:57,601
Forever?

683
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,037
Sure... or not.

684
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:02,206
I don't know. Honey,
here's the thing, you know,

685
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,408
do we want ghosts or do we not
want ghosts? Because I can...

686
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,111
Grandpa takes pills
because he's sick,

687
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,046
is grandpa gonna die?

688
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:11,015
(Whispering):
Why are you asking me this?

689
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,285
Yes? Yes.

690
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:15,719
Soon?

691
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:17,621
Well, you know, I mean,

692
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,123
I wouldn't get too attached
if I were you, so...
(Clears throat)

693
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,892
No! No, no, no.

694
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:23,561
That's not what I meant.
Look, i-i mean, I meant it,

695
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:25,229
but I was trying to be fun...
It was a joke, okay?

696
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:27,798
Here's the thing about death,
is that it's natural.

697
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,234
It's just natural.
I'm gonna die, okay?

698
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:32,169
