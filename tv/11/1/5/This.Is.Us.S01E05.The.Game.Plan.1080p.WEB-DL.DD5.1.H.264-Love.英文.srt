1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,630
You promise you like your gift?

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,030
Previously, on This Is Us...

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,710
The towel? It's absolutely terrible.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,670
He said you just go up and over

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,910
and burrito him.

6
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,800
They'll be in college soon.

7
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,440
Your Highness.

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,730
Need to find you a crown.

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,720
We're pretty good together.

10
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,360
These L.A. actors, they come out here, right?

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,660
They do their little stint in theater

12
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,500
just to feel better about themselves.

13
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,190
I'm here for the right reasons.

14
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,550
Let's get this over with, shall we?

15
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,090
- You got the part. - Wait, I'm sorry. What?

16
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,090
They think the nanny will sell tickets.

17
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,940
I did everything wrong by you,

18
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,410
and you've done everything right.

19
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,750
Look. It's Kevin.

20
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,920
This is my biological father.

21
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,710
Wow. Well, that probably is gonna be a longer conversation,

22
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,880
but it's good to meet you.

23
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,100
It's a pleasure to meet you.

24
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,010
Long signal pass.

25
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,410
Baltimore hopping out of an eight man front.

26
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,010
Namath throwing deep.

27
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,200
Sauer, gets wide, get it, he was there.

28
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,360
He had an inside step on Lenny Miles...

29
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,130
Beer.

30
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,450
Mommy.

31
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,180
Rebecca, you and your sister need to play somewhere else.

32
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,080
Your father's trying to watch the game.

33
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,810
Rick Volk, number 21,

34
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,580
uh, coming with a fake

35
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,790
safety blitz and he goes up top.

36
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,420
So that, um, is in pretty good...

37
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,940
He doesn't get all the glory of Rocky Bleier

38
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,010
or Franco Harris, but he's been a great...

39
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,350
Jack.

40
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,430
Jack.

41
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:27,680
Jack!

42
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,440
Yeah. ?

43
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:29,790
Sorry.

44
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,510
No. I refuse to be my mother

45
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,110
staring at my father as he stares at the television.

46
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:35,940
Okay.

47
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,460
I think Cincinnati's looked a little tired...

48
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,400
So teach me.

49
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,940
Teach me football.

50
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,900
We got an offensive line...

51
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,570
defensive line. Quart...

52
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,380
- End zone, end zone. - End zone, quarterback...

53
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,440
There's Bradshaw straight back...

54
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,870
You suck, Bradshaw!

55
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,130
- Come on, man. ?- Babe...

56
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,420
The man has three Super Bowl rings.

57
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,660
- Give him a break. - Yeah, he also

58
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,250
had Franco wide open in the flat.

59
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,360
You're a freakin' bum, Bradshaw.

60
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,400
You're a freakin' bum.

61
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,890
Typical Bradshaw.

62
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,810
Super Bowl!

63
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,020
- Time to tailgate! ?- Oh, already?

64
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,060
Yeah, babe. I got to move. Froggy's wants me to sing

65
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,000
at their pre-game party.

66
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,250
- Super Bowl Sunday? ?- Yeah.

67
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,580
Biggest crowd of the whole year.

68
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,000
- And we get to drink for free. - Oh, yeah.

69
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,070
So be there early, okay?

70
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,880
I'll be there before Bradshaw even begins

71
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,570
warming up his old noodle arm.

72
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,850
Easy on Bradshaw, babe.

73
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,450
Not in this house.

74
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,460
That's my girl. ?

75
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,660
Are Miguel and Shelly gonna make it?

76
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,770
Yeah. They're gonna meet us there, you know,

77
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,370
depending on if they can get a babysitter,

78
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,670
and one that doesn't show up completely

79
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,330
stoned out of her gourd this time.

80
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,550
Why do people have kids?

81
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,050
No idea.

82
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,390
All right.

83
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,250
You okay?

84
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,750
Stop.

85
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,740
Randall, wake the hell up.

86
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,880
You almost put a chemo pill in your shake.

87
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,450
Uncle Kevin,

88
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,240
why are you writing in your book?

89
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,820
Play, sweetheart. It's a play,

90
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,700
and the director wants me doing scene work.

91
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,990
You seem to be doing a lot of writing.

92
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,600
Well, I seem to be getting a lot of direction, William.

93
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,760
Tell you what. You got a great voice.

94
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,140
You ever do any voice-over work?

95
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,600
Well, you should.

96
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,000
Really. I mean, you could be a...

97
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,500
like a... like a... like an owl in a Pixar movie,

98
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,890
- right? ?- Yeah.

99
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,920
- No offense. - Not sure why I would take offense to that.

100
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,630
Oh, I don't do blueberries.

101
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,090
- Me neither. - Since when?

102
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,540
- Since now. - Yeah.

103
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,680
It's not the taste, right?

104
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,420
It's the texture of the skin, it's gross.

105
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,690
Yeah. I don't want blueberries either.

106
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,550
Yeah. Understood. Uh, any other dietary restrictions

107
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,630
I should let the staff know about?

108
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,060
No, man. You're busy. I'll just, you know,

109
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,030
I'll make a list for you later when I get some time.

110
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,410
Thanks, buddy.

111
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,980
You need to put something in your stomach, William.

112
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,500
Toast, pills, juice. That's the order. Okay?

113
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,590
Is that medicine?

114
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,020
Do you have a cold, Grandpa?

115
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,590
- Grandpa's fine. - No. They're just vitamins.

116
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,380
So.

117
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,720
You, uh, told the girls that he's Grandpa,

118
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,330
but not that he's sick. Right?

119
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,490
That's ballsy.

120
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,360
Hey, so, Kevin, uh,

121
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,080
it's been a few days now, you know,

122
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,020
- since you showed up. - Without calling.

123
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,510
- Right. - And... and it's great to see you.

124
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,200
I was just sort of wondering...

125
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,140
How do I say this politely?

126
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,230
When are you leaving?

127
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,810
Yeah. Yeah.

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,810
Yeah.

129
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,880
No, I mean, come on. I can, I... I can, um...

130
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,490
I can get out of here whenever. I just... I...

131
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,870
I saw this as an opportunity to hang with you two,

132
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,820
you know, and the girls, but, uh...

133
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,950
Plus I... honestly, this play, guys,

134
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,820
it's kicking my ass a little, You know? ?

135
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,930
And it's so lonely at that hotel.

136
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,590
I mean, I got this big suite all to myself,

137
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,280
but I guess the bigger the hotel room, the emptier it can feel.

138
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,730
You know? I'm sitting there.

139
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,390
I got that 800 thread count sheets.

140
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,560
I got the endless minibar snacks.

141
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,650
You got the fancy oatmeal soaps, plush robes

142
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,760
and all I can do is sit there

143
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,100
and think about how...

144
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,100
quiet it is.

145
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,470
- We'll take it. - What's that?

146
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,150
The hotel. Beth and I, we'll take it, tonight.

147
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,080
No, Randall. Where are we gonna get a sitter?

148
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:30,980
No, We got two family members

149
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,080
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no. - living in our house for free.

150
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,310
One of them played a nanny on TV.

151
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,600
No. ?No, actually, an au pair.

152
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
Technically, I played an au pair on TV.

153
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,620
There's a difference. A lot of people don't know that.

154
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,440
I was... an au pair.

155
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,100
They were gonna call the show what Au Pair, but the...

156
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,270
Manny tested better. I-I can watch the girls.

157
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,040
- I'm-a go pack. ?- Okay.

158
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,380
I'm-a go pack right now.

159
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,650
Good morning.

160
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,660
Breakfast in bed?

161
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,550
Yeah.

162
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,840
What did I do to deserve this?

163
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:05,990
I don't know.

164
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,460
You've done a lot of really nice things for me,

165
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,790
so I wanted to return the favor.

166
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,350
Oh. By cutting up cardboard into little squares

167
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,560
and putting it in a bowl?

168
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,670
Those are cheese squares.

169
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,420
Oh, yum.

170
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,580
Yeah. What's on top?

171
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,640
Oh, hemp seed.

172
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,640
Hemp seeds on top?

173
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,160
Boy, you really buried the lede.

174
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,760
?Now I'm in.

175
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,420
?What? You're not gonna have any nonsense made-up food?

176
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,490
No. Getting weighed at our meeting this afternoon.

177
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,370
You know what?

178
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,040
So am I.

179
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,470
I probably shouldn't eat, either. Damn.

180
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,950
?Hey, what do you want to do after the meeting?

181
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,200
I was thinking miniature golf.

182
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,400
Last time I was like, 20 under going into the 18th,

183
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,770
but that little windmill owns my ass.

184
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,580
I can't. Steelers.

185
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,620
Sunday Night Football. ?

186
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,270
Sunday Night Football.

187
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,280
With who?

188
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,640
Oh, no one. Just me.

189
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,330
All right. I'll watch with you.

190
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,360
Oh, no. Thanks, but I'm good.

191
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,660
Seriously?

192
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,280
You'd rather watch by yourself than watch with me?

193
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,210
Yeah. It's my thing.

194
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,360
I have a little ritual. You know? It's my thing.

195
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,370
Well, your thing...

196
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,760
is sad.

197
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,770
Not to me.

198
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,650
Okay.

199
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,350
Okay. How about this?

200
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,820
You can watch football...

201
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,510
all by yourself,

202
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,180
which is totally normal, but with me.

203
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,280
Toby. ?

204
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,340
This is something that I do alone. Okay?

205
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,650
Sure.

206
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,730
Great. Thank you for being so sweet.

207
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,870
Can you bring, like, a bowl of sugar for this?

208
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,720
*And if you give me*

209
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,420
*Weed*

210
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,770
*Whites*

211
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,340
*And wine*

212
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,440
*And you show me a sign*

213
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,450
*I'll be*

214
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,080
*Willin' to be*

215
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,110
*Movin'.*

216
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,760
Thank you. Go, Steelers!

217
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,700
Thank God. Can we please watch the game now?

218
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,010
The Rose Bowl is back.

220
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,950
Not an empty seat anywhere.

221
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,490
- Excuse me. - That was amazing.

222
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,460
- Ah, yeah? Really? - ?Yeah.

223
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,450
Oh! Shelly, Miguel.

224
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,130
There they are.

225
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,080
- So sorry we're late. - It's okay.

226
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,880
- Oh, I'm so sorry. - Damn, kids, man.

227
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,520
We were just about to head out the door,

228
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,270
and the baby decides to projective vomit

229
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,240
all over little Andy.

230
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,050
- Almost got me, too. - So, what does Andy do?

231
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,940
You know, four years old, built like a tank.

232
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,020
He slaps the baby.

233
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,070
Right across the face. Pow!

234
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,450
- No! Is she okay? - Oh, she's fine. Yeah.

235
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,620
But then the baby's screaming bloody murder,

236
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,400
I'm screaming at Andy,

237
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,330
and me, standing there, covered in vomit, and I'm like,

238
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,860
Andy, she is a baby.

239
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,460
Like, you literally slapped a baby.

240
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,160
Which really helped, as you can imagine.

241
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
Of course, then Andy starts crying,

242
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,410
- baby's crying, babysitter's crying. - We need drinks!

243
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,030
We need drinks. We'll be right back.

244
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,770
Okay.

245
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,480
Promise me we are never having kids.

246
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,770
I think it's time for shots.

247
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,840
Somebody's down.

248
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,940
26 is having a tough day.

250
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,410
The first half, the Rams, surprisingly,

251
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,480
- lead Pittsburgh 13 to 10. - Pathetic.

252
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,770
Can't stop the run.

253
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,040
Oh, and Bradshaw sucks!

254
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,500
Oh, no, Bradshaw's gonna have a huge second half, though.

255
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,620
Right, babe?

256
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,820
Yeah. Big... big second half.

257
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,110
Are you okay?

258
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,190
Mm. Fine.

259
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,880
Okay.

260
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,620
Actually, no.

261
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,520
What did you mean before when, uh...

262
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,460
when you said...

263
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,750
"Promise me we'll never have kids"?

264
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,910
Oh. I shouldn't have said that.

265
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,440
Yeah, but... you did.

266
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,630
Kind of said it twice today.

267
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,300
And I shouldn't have.

268
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,300
Okay?

269
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,800
Sorry.

270
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,410
You know what we need to be doing?

271
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,090
We need to be feeding the ball to Franco more, right?

272
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,770
-That's... -?'Cause we-we never really talk about it.

273
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,140
And I don't want to talk about it now, either.

274
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,270
We always say we're gonna talk about it in the future,

275
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,790
but it's the future now, Bec,

276
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,640
and I want kids.

277
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,210
You know what, we're gonna go grab another drink at the bar.

278
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,000
and see how the fans--

279
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,790
Let's go to the Ginger Man and Paul Hornung. ?

280
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,670
L.A. Fans have to be happy, Paul.

281
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,540
Bedtimes are at 8:00 and 9:00,

282
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,720
that's teeth brushed, in the bed. 8:00 and 9:00.

283
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,380
So one Sambuca to chase down the Ambien,

284
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,750
and then lights out, right?

285
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,040
That's too far.

286
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,320
Okay, listen, relax.

287
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,530
We're gonna have a nice, quiet evening at home. Okay?

288
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,840
The girls are gonna play.

289
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,890
I'm gonna memorize my lines and get off book.

290
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,700
Look, we want to make it clear that we're not normally

291
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,350
in the habit of leaving the girls overnight.

292
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,920
Let alone with two men who probably haven't been around kids that much.

293
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,820
One of them's best known for leaving a kid at a fire station.

294
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,470
Oh, my God, please, take care of my babies.

295
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,690
And, please, don't call us.

296
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,770
No, no, call us if you need us.

297
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:04,490
But don't need us.

298
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,800
Oh, one more thing, though, before you go.

299
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,380
So, Tess was the, uh,

300
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,840
the white wine drinker, right?

301
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,960
Annie likes the red 'cause I don't get that wrong.

302
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,830
Piss them off.

303
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,050
It's still too far. I can tell by the way you...

304
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,200
Yes. ?It's a little too far.

305
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,040
- He plays too much. ?- It's okay.

306
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:17,860
- It's okay. - He plays too much.

307
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,470
Hey, call us if you need anything.

308
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,170
Don't call us.

309
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,530
So, I have, you know, this-this issue with-with cracker control,

310
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,480
so what I've been finding to be really helpful ?

311
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,830
is if I...

312
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,690
take the portion out of the box

313
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,940
and then I put the portion onto the plate

314
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,280
- and then I put the box - Just pass it.

315
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,030
away, and then I know how-how many crackers

316
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,040
I'm allowed to-to have.

317
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,450
Just pass it.

318
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,190
To h -- to have.

319
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,700
So then I know that if-if I'm only allowed to have ten crackers,

320
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,750
then I have the ten crackers on my plate,

321
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,740
which is fine, but at the same time,

322
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,760
there are other crackers that I like than-than

323
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,310
other crackers. So, I might not like

324
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,350
saltine crackers as much as I like

325
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,730
a Cheez-It type cracker,

327
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,950
but so, what I'll do with the Cheez-It type cracker

329
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,990
is maybe put a little bit more on the plate,

330
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,970
but I'm still rationing,

331
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,350
so if I have a saltine, then I might put ten on the plate,

332
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,890
but there might be 20 if it's a Cheez-It. ?

333
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,840
But I still put the box away. So, I-I mean

334
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,510
I-I think that's -- that's a win.

335
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,800
She was always away on business.

336
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,780
So, I was used to being alone but this, you know, this...

337
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:35,580
but this was a different kind of alone.

338
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,260
She was always away on business, so I was used to being...

339
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,430
but... so, I was...

340
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,450
She was always away on business, so I was used to being alone,

341
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,850
but this was a different kind of alone.

342
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,360
You know? This-this is a different kind of...

343
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,860
I thought you two were watching a movie.

344
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,160
We want to have a Barbie fashion show.

345
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,470
Oh, cool. That sounds fun.

346
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,040
So, go play Barbie fashion show.

347
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,260
We need you to be the celebrity judge.

348
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,640
Right.

349
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,590
Uh, the thing is I can't,

350
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,900
because I got this rehearsal tomorrow

351
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,640
and I really want to be off book, so...

352
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,870
What does "Off book" mean?

353
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,510
Off book. Off book means, uh,

354
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,760
means that I know my lines.

355
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,530
Have Grandpa be the judge.

356
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,440
Grandpa's not a celebrity.

357
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,240
Yeah.

358
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,000
Their logic seems sound.

359
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,880
Thank you.

360
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,480
Okay. Um... tell you what? You want to,

361
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,770
you want to help me? You want to,

362
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,940
you want to read the play with me?

363
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,120
- Okay. - ?Yeah. Oh, come on.

364
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,090
- Okay. ?- Yeah, let's do that.

365
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,220
Come on, over here. William,

366
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,020
- let's do it. - I'm not much of an actor.

367
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,600
Oh, doesn't matter.

368
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,100
I just need to get the lines down, so...

369
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,080
All right, Tess, we'll start with you.

370
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,240
Uh, you're gonna be Jessica, David's wife.

371
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,490
Why does she get to be Jessica?

372
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,270
Oh, because you're Gracie, okay?

373
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,250
Gracie's Jessica's mom, which is kind of cool.

374
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,860
It means you get to boss your sister around.

375
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,820
How's that sound?

376
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,180
So. William, multiple questions.

377
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,460
First one, I'm not gonna lie to you,

378
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,780
- it's a little delicate. - ?Go ahead.

379
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,070
Do you know how to read?

380
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,210
Yes, I can read.

381
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,620
I knew it. I was joking.

382
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,870
Of course you know how to read.

383
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,900
Trying to be funny. Okay.

384
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,290
So if you could please read the role of Brad.

385
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,410
Terrific, okay. Whoa, where we going?

386
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,540
I have to pee.

387
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,730
Oh, I kind of do, too.

388
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,530
What are you... Oh, good God.

389
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,090
Now, this is what I'm talking about.

390
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,640
Okay, babe, here's the plan.

391
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,960
Sex first.

392
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,080
Right away.

393
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,790
Loud, adult,

394
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,670
no kids in the next room sex.

395
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,910
And it doesn't have to be marathon sex.

396
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,940
We just need to get the job done.

397
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,470
And under no circumstances are we allowed

398
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,720
to fall asleep afterwards watching House Hunters.

399
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,620
Don't want to miss the whole night sleeping. Right?

400
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,650
We'll do it in the shower.

401
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,570
That's good.

402
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,240
Won't fall asleep in the big fancy shower.

403
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,410
And we'll order room service before.

404
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,630
That way we will finish our loud adult shower sex

405
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,980
just as room service arrives and we will slip on robes

406
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,870
and eat burgers... No, wait-- spaghetti.

407
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,150
No, I like burgers better.

408
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,820
We will eat burgers in bed.

409
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,020
Oh. Now, the big question is...

410
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,150
what to order on pay-per-view.

411
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,310
Oh, I already hope they, uh,

412
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,430
I hope they have that Huge Grant-Meryl Streep movie that

413
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,800
sounds like a black lady. Come on.

414
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,730
Florence Foster Jenkins.

415
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,750
Baby, they already got Florence Foster Jenkins.

416
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,740
I'm late.

417
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,910
I'm a week and a half late, Randall,

418
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,550
and I feel like crap.

419
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,460
And I was chewing on ice all day yesterday

420
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,750
and I almost threw up when I looked at pizza

421
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,600
and I cannot bring myself to go to the drugstore

422
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,100
and get a pregnancy test.

423
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,390
I'm bugging out, baby.

424
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,350
I need you to talk me down.

425
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,540
- Hey, how are you? ?- Hey, good.

426
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,410
Come on in. We got carrots, celery,

427
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,440
broccoli, no dip. You're welcome.

428
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,190
Thank you, that's so nice.

429
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,680
Oh, and, uh, Kate, this is my good friend, Shooter.

430
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,880
Shooter, Kate.

431
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,670
Nice to finally meet you, Kate.

432
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,120
Hi. Nice to meet you, too.

433
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,250
Great news. You both love sports, so...

434
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,320
sports party.

435
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,480
So, what do you think, Jack?

436
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,790
Looking like it's gonna come down to the fourth quarter.

437
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,720
You want to do this now? Okay. Let's do it.

438
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:55,930
So...

439
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,940
I am not enough for you.

440
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,840
Am I not enough for you, Jack?

441
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,470
- Okay, back to the bar? - Yep.

442
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,440
I never said that. I just meant

443
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,450
we need to have this conversation at some point.

444
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,280
Okay. And you want to do that right now, at Froggy's

445
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,540
- during the Super Bowl? - Yes,

446
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,860
please don't make us miss a second of your drama.

447
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,080
Could you butt out?

448
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,710
Babe, we joke about it.

449
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,710
We see people with kids and go,

450
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,140
"Oh, thank God that's not us."

451
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,180
We joke about it. Right?

452
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,800
Did I not get the joke?

453
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,620
I'm not...

454
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,090
Babe, you're right.

455
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,590
You are right.

456
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,750
And coming from the family that-that I did,

457
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,180
I definitely never saw myself having kids.

458
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,580
- Okay. ?- But then I met you.

459
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,220
And, you know, we're j... we're great together

460
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,430
and I love our life.

461
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,880
But the older we get, the more I think that...

462
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,350
the more I think there's got to be something bigger

463
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,530
than just me and you.

464
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,880
Well, thank you very much for involving me

465
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,750
in this huge invisible change of yours. Huge.

466
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,020
Because you knew when you met me and married me

467
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,890
that I did not want to be one of those women

468
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,860
whose sole purpose in life was to be a mother.

469
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,030
If that's what you wanted, you should have married my mom.

470
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,070
I was thinking more your sister.

471
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,790
Oh. You probably were.

472
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,920
I'm... it's a bad joke.

473
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,710
I'm not there yet, Jack.

474
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,380
I'm not there yet.

475
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,960
- I am only 29. - ?Almost 30.

476
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,410
I know how old I am!

477
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,550
Hey, Sid and Nancy, will you two take it outside?

479
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,800
- Could you just shut up for a second? - Mind your business.

480
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,470
None of us can hear the game over your mouth.

481
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,170
You got to learn some manners, pal.

482
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,680
You need to control your woman.

483
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,100
You need to watch your mouth.

484
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,800
Jack, sit down.

485
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,830
Come here. It's not worth it.

486
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,720
Jack, sit down, please.

487
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,390
Jack.

488
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,770
- God, Jack. - ?Jack! Jack.

489
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,040
No! No, no, no, no.

490
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,830
Yeah,

491
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,700
we should really be having kids.

493
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,570
Aren't you gonna say anything?

494
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,340
Uh, yeah. Like, how?

495
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,610
- You take the pill every day like clockwork, right? - Yeah.

496
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,590
What, did I accidentally drop one in my shake or something?

497
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,580
No. I...

498
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,560
I mean, I changed medications last month

499
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,380
and there might have been, like, a brief window.

500
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,500
A brief window?

501
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,580
Sorry.

502
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,650
A brief window, Beth?

503
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,310
Did it not occur to you that that might be something

504
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,550
you want to run by your husband?

505
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,090
Well, I didn't know it was gonna be a problem.

506
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,820
Well, there goes Charleston.

507
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,340
Okay, I'm sorry, what?

508
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,440
Ten years from now, when the girls are both off at college,

509
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,260
I thought that we would take an early retirement in Charleston.

510
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,540
Oh, forgive me, Randall,

511
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,470
but what in the holy hell are you talking about?

512
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,860
Since when do you want to move to Charleston?

513
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,520
I saw something about it on CNN.

514
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,310
Like, they got a great quality of life, good restaurants.

515
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,620
Sometimes at work, I look up places on Zillow.

516
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,570
Oh, okay. Well, I'm so sorry that

517
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,130
I'm screwing with your super top secret Charleston dream, honey.

518
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,710
No, my issues are nothing compared to yours.

519
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,850
- Nobody's saying that. - Wait,wait, wait, wait, wait,

520
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,810
here's a riddle--

521
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,730
who has two hands and was about to go back to work full-time

522
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,850
and maybe, maybe... start to remember who she was?

523
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:32,700
Yeah?

524
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,230
But now will have to split her time between

525
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,720
a diaper station and a home office?

526
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,980
This girl, right here.

527
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,840
- It's two thumbs. - ?What?

528
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,870
You're doing it wrong.

529
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,200
You're supposed to say what has two thumbs and is

530
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,710
- gonna be splitting time betw..." - ?Shut up.

531
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,360
Okay, that's real nice, Beth.

532
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,200
- Also, some Altoids. - ?Please.

533
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,980
Look at that picture.

534
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,680
That is a vivid picture.

535
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,380
I feel like I'm at the game.

536
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,310
Over across the field, here.

537
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,840
Yeah. It's a really nice TV...

538
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,920
What is this?

539
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,490
Plasma?

540
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,300
LED
LED?

541
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,710
You know, I'm really not sure, but...

542
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,560
Hey, Toby!

543
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,400
Yeah?

544
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,220
- Uh, do you guys like jicama? - ?Plasma or LED?

545
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,970
I...

546
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,020
have no idea.

547
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,750
- Kate? Jicama? ?- What?

548
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,350
Is that a vegetable or a fruit?

549
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,220
Can... can you actually just move, Tob?

550
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,400
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep.

551
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,830
The receiver's all set.

552
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,070
To the right, Ben looks straight over the middle,

553
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,310
and going for the end zone!

554
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,060
Shooter, uh, tell Kate

555
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,660
about that time we accidentally

556
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,820
went to an Ashlee Simpson concert.

557
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,160
Uh, you got to hear this.

558
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,270
- So, we were trying to... - I'm sorry.

559
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,730
Toby, you paused the TV.

560
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,820
It's like, paused.

561
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,260
Yeah, just for a second. Listen to this.

562
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,880
No, this is a great story.

563
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,770
No. O-Okay,

564
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,650
I know it's not a big deal, really,

565
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,350
but I kind of like to watch sports

566
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,440
as they happen live.

567
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,720
Probably just me, right?

568
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,770
- I don't know. - Okay. Okay. Here we go.

569
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,890
- ...tends to wait... - Now we're behind the game!

570
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,170
Fast forward it!

571
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,240
Touch down!

572
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,460
And Heyward made it all alone down the left side...

573
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,840
That's great. That's your team, right?

574
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,020
That's my fantasy team.

575
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,370
- What's that? - ?You know what,

576
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,530
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

577
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,080
I'm actually not feeling good.

578
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,950
I'm gonna go ahead and go.

579
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,740
Oh, no!

580
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,410
Are you sure?

581
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,780
No, Kate, stay.

582
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,680
Shooter...

583
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,570
- It was really nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

584
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,560
- What... wait, wait, wait. - Seriously,

585
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,920
- thank you for the jicama. - ?What...

586
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,940
I'll talk to you later.

587
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,700
What is happening?

588
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,220
You have to let her go, David.

589
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,230
This is crazy, man.

590
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,460
She's gone and she's never coming back.

591
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,290
You really never acted before?

592
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,100
Nope.

593
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,920
Voice like silk.

594
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,590
How am I supposed to move on, David?

595
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,940
No. I'm David.

596
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,890
How am I supposed to move on, Brad?

597
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,800
And who made you the expert of moving on?

598
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,660
Or the expert of anything for that matter?

599
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,300
Is that how you're gonna do it?

600
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,080
No.

601
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,480
Good.

602
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,790
It's your line.

603
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,070
Tess, honey, you have the next line.

604
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,770
Pay attention.

605
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,660
?I-I'd rather you not move on. I'm--

606
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,850
I'm obv-- I'm obviously not planning to.

607
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:08,840
It's not good.

608
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,170
Not as easy as it looks, is it?

609
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,830
- No. - ?No. Okay.

610
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,320
There she is! Do you see her?

611
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,800
Who, David? Did I see who?

612
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,220
Her! She's right there.

613
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:16,900
And ever since she died,

614
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,470
her ghost has been haunting me.

615
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,560
Hold up.

616
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:21,860
What's the matter, sweetheart?

617
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,090
What's happening in this story?

618
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,150
You're not following the story?

619
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,160
Do you follow it?

620
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,220
Of course. Yes, of course I follow it.

621
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,510
She died, right?

622
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,380
She's dead.

623
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,680
But she keeps coming back as a ghost.

624
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,990
So when you die you become a ghost?

625
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,190
No.

626
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,870
No, no, no, no, no. No. Sweetheart, ghosts aren't real.

627
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,710
So what happens when you die?

628
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,330
What happens when you die?

629
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,710
Uh, is... you die.

630
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,570
Forever?

631
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,320
Sure... or not.

632
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,220
I don't know. Honey, here's the thing, you know,

633
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,570
do we want ghosts or do we not want ghosts? Because I can...

634
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,370
Grandpa takes pills because he's sick,

635
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,000
is Grandpa gonna die?

636
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,460
Why are you asking me this?

637
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,520
Yes? Yes.

638
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,000
Soon?

639
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,560
Well, you know, I mean,

640
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,920
I wouldn't get too attached if I were you, so...

641
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:21,840
No! No, no, no.

642
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,580
That's not what I meant. Look, I-I mean, I meant it,

643
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,160
but I was trying to be fun... It was a joke, okay?

644
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,030
Here's the thing about death, is that it's natural.

645
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,600
It's just natural. I'm gonna die, okay?

646
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,330
You two? You're gonna die.

647
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,230
Mommy and Daddy are gonna die.

648
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,220
- Mommy and Daddy are gonna die? - No. Uh...

649
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,400
Look, uh, oh, my gosh, Wil... it is getting late.

650
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,670
It's bedtime, girls.

651
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,830
- Come on, girls. - Yep.

652
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,770
Time to go to bed. Uh, sleep tight.

653
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,820
Thanks for all the help.

654
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,290
Don't forget to brush your teeth.

655
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,200
Wh-when did you guys know you wanted kids?

656
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:05,160
Uh, about, uh, four months into her first pregnancy.

657
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,320
Rebecca thinks that if we have kids,

658
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,660
our lives are gonna be over.

659
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,980
She's right, pal. Yeah.

660
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,060
She's totally right.

661
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,770
You can kiss this life good-bye.

662
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,360
What if she doesn't want kids?

663
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,430
Is that really like a, like a deal-breaker?

664
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,520
I got to go find Shelly.

665
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,720
That over the wrong shoulder.

666
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,980
That's one of the great catches you'll ever see.

667
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,100
73 yards.

668
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,890
And the terrible towels will come out

669
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,430
throughout the Rose Bowl.

670
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,090
Not much doubt about the best team.

671
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:22,200
Just been informed that the MVP for this contest

673
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,830
as picked by Sport Magazine

675
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,850
and their panel of voters is Terry Bradshaw.

676
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,970
This isn't the night I had planned.

677
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,050
I know.

678
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,520
Shall we look?

679
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,090
Wait. Just, um, let's... let's...

680
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,770
let's give it like, 30 more seconds.

681
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:56,800
Okay.

682
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,790
You'll still be able to work more.

683
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,540
I can work less.

684
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,080
We'll get a nanny.

685
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,980
Or a manny.

686
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,870
God, no.

687
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,020
You know, if you still want

688
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,620
- that vacation house, you can... - ?I don't.

689
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,960
It's too much trouble.

690
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,770
Worrying about hurricanes

691
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,270
and whether or not it gets broken into by some kids

692
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,740
using it for their who knows what?

693
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,570
Damn South Carolina punk-ass kids.

694
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,830
You know, a son wouldn't totally suck.

695
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,730
We do make good kids.

696
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:45,390
That we do, that we do.

697
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,460
The girls will love it.

698
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,900
Oh, they'll go nuts.

699
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,570
What has two thumbs

700
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,080
and loves his wife so much it hurts?

701
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,840
Oh, it does work better with two thumbs.

702
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,120
Nah. I like the way you do it.

703
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,650
Mm. Well... I like your face.

704
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,440
Shall we do this?

705
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,870
Well, that conversation went sideways, didn't it?

706
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,240
Randall's gonna punch me for that conversation.

707
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,010
I got to go talk to the girls.

708
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,930
Go talk to the girls-- what am I gonna say?

709
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,970
You know, I am clearly not the man

710
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,060
that needs to be talking to them

711
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,940
about the intricacies of life and death.

712
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,720
It's...

713
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,900
You do that a lot.

714
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,630
I do what a lot?

715
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,290
Doubt yourself.

716
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,100
You were very good, Kevin.

717
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,120
On that show.

718
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,640
You watched The Manny?

719
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,170
Before I came here, I had one old television,

720
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,650
got three channels.

721
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,600
I really liked that program.

722
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,820
And I remember thinking, he's very talented.

723
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,810
I liked the one where you lose the baby.

724
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,880
Oh, geez.

725
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,160
"Manny on Fire."

726
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,570
Yeah, you know. That was a...

727
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,880
That was a strong episode.

728
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,820
- Yeah. ?- Yeah, yeah.

729
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,620
I never should have left that show.

730
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,520
I've...

731
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,140
I never should have come here, that's for sure.

732
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,270
Being an uncle, right, doing theater...

733
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,260
I... I...

734
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,490
I'm not cut out for theater.

735
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,270
And there you go again.

736
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,400
Well, yeah, I mean, that's easy for you to say, right?

737
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,590
You're the wise owl in a Pixar film.

738
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,700
I'm the dopey Labrador.

739
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,960
I'm a dying recovering addict.

740
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,060
- Yeah, whatever. - ?Yeah, well, people love Labradors.

741
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,260
Said the wise owl.

742
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,840
You want to know what it is?

743
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,230
It's this play, right?

744
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,330
I mean, these people that I'm working with,

745
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,460
wow, they're like next level smart.

746
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,870
I mean, uh, they're brilliant.

747
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,420
And then they look at me like I'm a joke, right?

748
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,110
Which makes me start to think that I am a joke,

749
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,870
and then I start spinning.

750
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,060
I don't even know what the play's about anymore.

751
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,150
Kevin, what did you think it was about when you first read it?

752
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,360
You know, it doesn't ma-- it doesn't matter, it's...

753
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,700
You're just gonna think it's stupid.

755
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,840
Said the dopey Labrador.

756
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,500
We did it!

757
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,970
If it's between you and having kids, you win.

758
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,450
Every time.

759
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,000
No question.

760
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,430
My father,

761
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,630
he loved football more than anything.

762
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,130
Most of the time, he-he pretty much

763
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,010
didn't want anything to do with me.

764
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,530
But... if he was watching football,

765
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,120
he let me sit

766
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,360
and watch the game with him.

767
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,840
As long as I'd sit on the floor

768
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,350
and I didn't talk too much.

769
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:58,620
I always imagined that when I had kids

770
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,930
that I'd watch the games with them, too.

771
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,770
Except I-I'd let them talk...

772
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,280
as loud as they wanted.

773
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,060
I don't know what's wrong with me.

774
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,940
God, there's nothing wrong with you, Bec.

775
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,390
All of my friends my age have kids.

776
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,070
Every single one of them.

777
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,670
And...

778
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,840
maybe it's 'cause I'm still singing at Froggy's

779
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,080
and I'm not as far along as I thought I would be.

780
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,110
I don't know.

781
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,130
'Cause the truth is, when I close my eyes

782
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,190
and I think about our future...

783
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:46,290
I see us with kids, Jack.

784
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,940
Yeah.

785
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,280
I just...

786
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,870
I love our life.

787
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,800
I love it right now.

788
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,220
And I'm so scared of changing it.

789
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,340
I don't want to change it.

790
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,880
Okay? I'm not gonna stand for anything changing between us.

791
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,600
Okay? What we have together, you and me.

792
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:13,730
Nothing.

793
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:22,040
Look, I'm sorry about pressuring you all day.

794
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,780
I just...

795
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,900
I just want you.

796
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,970
The Steelers won the Super Bowl.

797
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,590
Steelers won the Super Bowl.

798
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,090
Bradshaw won MVP.

800
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,030
Yes.

801
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:56,930
I am.

802
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,730
You are.

803
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:21,860
?Okay.

804
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,390
So, uh...

805
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,460
what was all that about today?

806
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,890
I told you I wanted to watch the game by myself.

807
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,310
Then why did you agree to come over?

808
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:34,650
I don't know.

809
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,780
'Cause I didn't want to...

810
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,230
seem like a weirdo.

811
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,940
Okay. So, now I know.

812
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,830
No hanging out on Sundays during football season.

813
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,600
- I got it. ?- But it's not just about football.

814
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,470
Okay. What's it about then?

815
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,140
Okay. So, growing up,

816
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,960
I used to watch the Steelers with my dad.

817
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:57,160
Right? Every single Sunday,

818
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,460
until I grew up and...

819
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:03,130
I moved out here and I just got out of the habit.

820
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,250
It wasn't until the 2006 AFC Championship

821
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,010
when they played the Broncos. Do you remember?

822
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,260
No.

823
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,530
Okay. Anyway,

824
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,580
I wanted to watch 'em with my dad.

825
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,420
And I did. And they won.

826
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,980
And then they won the Super Bowl.

827
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,630
And I just...

828
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,100
It's just-just what I do now.

829
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,580
I watch the Steelers, and...

830
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,760
I watch 'em with my dad.

831
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,150
He sounds like a cool guy.

832
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,690
I'd like to meet him sometime.

833
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,530
Yeah.

834
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,470
Okay.

835
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,370
Yeah.

836
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:42,810
Okay.

837
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,050
Um... ?All right.

838
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,320
And I know it's gonna be a little creepy.

839
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,880
This is your dad?

840
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,230
Jack.

841
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,600
I know it sounds crazy and lame,

842
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:13,150
but football is a really big part of my family. Like, really big.

843
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,340
Like, I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for football.

844
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,580
I was conceived in a bathroom during the Super Bowl.

845
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,830
Sorry if I was a jerk before.

846
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,860
You're really not gonna forgive me?

847
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,010
Okay.

848
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,960
What if I told you a-a secret

849
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,300
that I've never shared with anyone before?

850
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,890
We're listening.

851
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,280
Okay. All right.

852
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,270
But you got to promise not to tell anyone though, okay?

853
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,430
This is a very private thing that I'm sharing with you.

854
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,940
Is this about you dating Demi Lovato?

855
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,330
Because everyone knows.

856
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,750
No. You know what, it's not about Demi Lovato,

857
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,000
and we were just friends. I just...

858
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,520
Sometimes I... paint.

859
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,540
Now, no one knows this, not even your Aunt Kate,

860
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,930
but... when I get a script,

861
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:25,200
the first thing I do is just sort of paint the way it makes me feel.

862
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,650
I painted this after I read that play for the first time.

863
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:37,690
So...

864
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,860
I think I scared you before.

865
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:53,020
Um, all that talk of ghosts and dying.

866
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,470
All that adult stuff we were reading about.

867
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,780
That's some pretty confusing adult stuff.

868
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,980
So, uh, you know,

869
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,190
I thought I would come up here, show you my painting,

870
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,450
tell you what I think my play is about.

871
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:07,140
Because I was thinking, um,

872
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,960
that it might make us all feel a little bit better.

873
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,150
But you got to promise not to make fun of me, okay?

874
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,380
So, um...

875
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,100
Yeah, I painted this because I felt like the play was about life, you know?

876
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,930
And life is full of color.

877
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,390
And we each get to come along

878
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,740
and we add our own color to the painting.

879
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,510
You know? And even though it's not very big, the painting,

880
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,210
you sort of have to figure that it goes on forever,

881
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:38,340
you know, in each direction. So, like, to infinity, you know?

882
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,320
'Cause that's kind of like life, right?

883
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,090
And it's really crazy, if you think about it, isn't it,

884
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:43,860
that, a hundred years ago,

885
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:48,380
some guy that I never met came to this country with a suitcase.

886
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:56,820
He has a son,

887
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,830
who has a son,

888
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,920
who has me.

889
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,280
So, at first, when I was painting,

890
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,680
I was thinking, you know, maybe up here,

891
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,840
that was that guy's part of the painting and then, you know,

892
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,090
down here, that's my part of the painting.

893
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,190
And then I started to think, well, what if...

894
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,250
we're all in the painting, everywhere?

896
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,360
And-and what if we're in the painting before we're born?

898
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,520
What if we're in it after we die?

900
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,490
And these colors that we keep adding,

901
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,510
what if they just keep getting added on top of one another,

902
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:31,780
until eventually we're not even different colors anymore?

903
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,550
We're just... one thing.

904
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,270
One painting.

905
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,010
- Lucky cap. - ?Lucky cap.

906
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:50,200
I mean, my dad is not with us anymore.

907
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:53,010
He's not alive, but he's with us.

909
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,880
He's with me every day.

910
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,600
It all just sort of fits somehow.

911
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,090
And even if you don't understand how yet,

912
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:08,630
people will die in our lives, people that we love.

913
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,040
In the future.

914
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,770
Maybe tomorrow.

915
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,350
Maybe years from now.

916
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,170
I mean, it's kind of beautiful, right,

917
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,270
if you think about it, the fact that just because someone dies,

918
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,360
just because you can't see them

919
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,990
or talk to them anymore,

920
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,040
it doesn't mean they're not still in the painting.

921
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,620
I think maybe that's the point of the whole thing.

922
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:29,410
There's no dying.

923
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,830
There's no you or me or them.

924
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,970
It's just us.

925
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,830
And this... sloppy...

926
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,110
wild, colorful, magical thing

927
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,220
that has no beginning, it has no end...

928
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,060
this right here...

929
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,130
I think it's us.

933
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,330
