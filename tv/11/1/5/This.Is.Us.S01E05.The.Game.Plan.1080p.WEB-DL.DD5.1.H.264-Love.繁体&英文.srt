然后把干放在P子上
and then I put the portion onto the plate

314
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,280
-把盒子  -f^去就行了
- and then I put the box - Just pass it.

315
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,030
放得hh的  然后我就知道我只能吃
away, and then I know how-how many crackers

316
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,040
多少K干了
I'm allowed to-to have.

317
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,450
f^去就行了

多少K干
To h -- to have.

319
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,700
我知道了如果我只能吃十K干
So then I know that if-if I'm only allowed to have ten crackers,

320
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,750
我就只放十K干在P子里
then I have the ten crackers on my plate,

321
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,740
@挺好的  但是同r
which is fine, but at the same time,

322
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,760
τ谝恍╋干碚f
there are other crackers that I like than-than

323
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,310
我更喜g吃另外的追N干
other crackers. So, I might not like

324
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,350
比如我更喜g吃芝士干
saltine crackers as much as I like

325
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,730
而不是很喜gK打干
a Cheez-It type cracker,

326
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,990
{\an8}你被邀⒓油斜鹊"人"派

我也S多放K在P子里
is maybe put a little bit more on the plate,

330

但我是栏窨刂盗
but I'm still rationing,

331
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,350
所以如果是K打干  我放十K在P子里
so if I have a saltine, then I might put ten on the plate,

332
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,890
如果是芝士干  就放二十K
but there might be 20 if it's a Cheez-It. ?

333
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,840
但我是把盒子拿_  所以

00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,100
@就是我F在的T
It's just-just what I do now.

829
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,580
我看匹堡人的比...
I watch the Steelers, and...

830
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,760
我和我爸一起看
I watch 'em with my dad.

831
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,150
他起硎不e的人
He sounds like a cool guy.

832
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,690
有rg介B一下我JR吧
I'd like to meet him sometime.

833
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,530
好

834
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,470

Okay.

835
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,370

836
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:42,810
好吧
Okay.

837
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,050
好吧
Um... ?All right.

838
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,320
我知道@有c}人
And I know it's gonna be a little creepy.

839
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,880
@是你爸
This is your dad?

840
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,230
杰克
Jack.

841
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,600
我知道@起砗艹逗苓d
I know it sounds crazy and lame,

842
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:13,150
但我家很重橄烨  特e重
but football is a really big part of my family. Like, really big.

843
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,340
如果不是因殚烨  我都不出生
Like, I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for football.

844
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,580
我是超碗比r  在l生g焉狭宋
I was conceived in a bathroom during the Super Bowl.

845
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,830
抱歉我之前B度不好
Sorry if I was a jerk before.

846
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,860
你真不打算原我
You're really not gonna forgive me?

847
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,010
好吧
Okay.

848
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,960
那如果我告V你
What if I told you a-a secret

849
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,300
一我]跟人f^的秘密呢
that I've never shared with anyone before?

850
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,890
ff看吧
We're listening.

851
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,280
好  行
Okay. All right.

852
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,270
但你得保C不告Ve人
But you got to promise not to tell anyone though, okay?

853
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,430
我要f的事很私密
This is a very private thing that I'm sharing with you.

854
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,940
是你和黛米・洛瓦托[歌手]交往的事
Is this about you dating Demi Lovato?

855
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,330
因榇蠹叶贾道@事
Because everyone knows.

856
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,750
不是  不是黛米・洛瓦托的事
No. You know what, it's not about Demi Lovato,

857
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,000
而且我跟她只是普通朋友  我...
and we were just friends. I just...

858
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,520
我有r候
Sometimes I... paint.

859
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,540
l都不知道@事  你P特姑姑也不知道
Now, no one knows this, not even your Aunt Kate,

860
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,930
我拿到”r
but... when I get a script,

861
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:25,200
第一件事就是把自己的感X出
the first thing I do is just sort of paint the way it makes me feel.

862
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,650
我第一次x了那”竞  就了@幅
I painted this after I read that play for the first time.

863
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:37,690
o
So...

864
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,860
我想我以前^你
I think I scared you before.

865
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:53,020
v什么鬼故事啊  死亡啊
Um, all that talk of ghosts and dying.

866
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,470
所有大人x^的故事
All that adult stuff we were reading about.

867
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,780
一些成人困惑的大人事情
That's some pretty confusing adult stuff.

868
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,980
所以
So, uh, you know,

869
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,190
我以槲疫^斫o你看我的
I thought I would come up here, show you my painting,

870
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,450
f一下我演那部虻闹黝}
tell you what I think my play is about.

871
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:07,140
因槲以谙
Because I was thinking, um,

872
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,960
@我都好受些
that it might make us all feel a little bit better.

873
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,150
但你不能笑我  好
But you got to promise not to make fun of me, okay?

874
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,380
那么
So, um...

875
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,100
我了@幅是因槲矣X得@部〉闹髦际巧活
Yeah, I painted this because I felt like the play was about life, you know?

876
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,930
生活充M了色彩
And life is full of color.

877
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,390
每人一路走
And we each get to come along

878
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,740
樯活砹俗约旱念色
and we add our own color to the painting.

879
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,510
M管@幅不是什么神作
You know? And even though it's not very big, the painting,

880
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,210
你得琢磨出l持m下午
you sort of have to figure that it goes on forever,

881
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:38,340
每方向都o限延伸下去
you know, in each direction. So, like, to infinity, you know?

882
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,320
因檫@就是生活  Π
'Cause that's kind of like life, right?

883
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,090
仔想想  其很不可思h
And it's really crazy, if you think about it, isn't it,

884
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:43,860
一百年前
that, a hundred years ago,

885
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:48,380
一我素未\面的人е行李箱淼竭@家
some guy that I never met came to this country with a suitcase.

886
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:56,820
他有一鹤
He has a son,

887
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,830
鹤佑钟鹤
who has a son,

888
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,920
鹤拥鹤佑钟鹤  就是我
who has me.

889
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,280
所以我一_始的r候
So, at first, when I was painting,

890
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,680
我r想  也W在@里
I was thinking, you know, maybe up here,

891
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,840
中@里是@人的起c
that was that guy's part of the painting and then, you know,

892
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,090
而我就在的@里
down here, that's my part of the painting.

893
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,190
然后我_始思考  如果...
And then I started to think, well, what if...

894
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,250
如果我都在布上呢
we're all in the painting, everywhere?

895
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,820
{\an8}三小家伙

896
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,360
如果我出生前  命\就已被好了呢
And-and what if we're in the painting before we're born?

897
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:20,680
{\an8}三小家伙

898
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,520
如果我死后才出F在上呢
What if we're in it after we die?

899
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,920
{\an8}三小家伙

900
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,490
我添加的@些色
And these colors that we keep adding,

901
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,510
如果都只是相互g色的B加呢
what if they just keep getting added on top of one another,

902
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:31,780
直到最后我都成了同拥念色呢
until eventually we're not even different colors anymore?

903
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,550
我都只是一w的
We're just... one thing.

904
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,270
一幅
One painting.

905
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,010
-幸\帽  -幸\帽
- Lucky cap. - ?Lucky cap.

906
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:50,200
我爸不在我身了
I mean, my dad is not with us anymore.

907
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:53,010
他去世了  但他活在我心里
He's not alive, but he's with us.

908
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,290
{\an8}未言

909
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,880
每天都活在我心里
He's with me every day.

910
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,600
一切都冥冥中自有安排
It all just sort of fits somehow.

911
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,090
即便你F在不知道何r何地
And even if you don't understand how yet,

912
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:08,630
我鄣娜私Kx世
people will die in our lives, people that we love.

913
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,040
也S在未
In the future.

914
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,770
也S在明天
Maybe tomorrow.

915
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,350
也S啄旰
Maybe years from now.

916
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,170
其挺美好的
I mean, it's kind of beautiful, right,

917
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,270
如果仔想想  就算一人死了
if you think about it, the fact that just because someone dies,

918
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,360
就算你不到@些人
just because you can't see them

919
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,990
不能再和他f
or talk to them anymore,

920
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,040
不代表中]有他的位置
it doesn't mean they're not still in the painting.

921
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,620
我想也S@就是全部的意x所在
I think maybe that's the point of the whole thing.

922
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:29,410
]有死亡
There's no dying.

923
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,830
]有为的你或我  或者他
There's no you or me or them.

924
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,970
我都是一w的
It's just us.

925
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,830
@幅...凌y的
And this... sloppy...

926
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,110
狂野的  色彩_的奇妙之
wild, colorful, magical thing

927
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,220
]有起c  也]有Kc
that has no beginning, it has no end...

928
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,060

929
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,130
