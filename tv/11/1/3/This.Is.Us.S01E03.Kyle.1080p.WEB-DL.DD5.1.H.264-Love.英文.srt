1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,310
Previously on This Is Us...

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,920
- Baby? - ?Something's not right.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,450
We lost the third baby, Jack.

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,600
I'm very sorry.

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,580
I like to think that

6
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,150
you took the sourest lemon that life has to offer

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,700
and turned it into something resembling lemonade.

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,700
36 years ago, my life started with you leaving me

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,220
on a fire station doorstep.

10
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,540
Beth, The man has stage IV stomach cancer.

11
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,910
Why you watching this stuff?

12
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,330
Told them to go screw themselves.

13
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,580
I'm moving to New York.

14
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,020
"Show business."

15
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,780
Grandma and Grandpa are here!

16
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,640
I'll be in my room.

22
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,930
This is the scariest part.

23
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,850
Some people think the scariest part

24
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,930
is coming to the hospital to have the baby.

25
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,500
Nah. The scariest part

26
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,680
is leaving the hospital with the baby.

27
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,270
- Babies.  - Babies, of course.

28
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,900
Doc, these two, they only fall asleep

29
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,820
if they're next to each other.

30
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,410
Is that unusual?

31
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,310
Well, they've been sharing the same hot tub the last nine months;

32
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,990
you can't bust them up right away.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,480
No, I'm not concerned.

34
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,390
Did she tell you what we named them?

35
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,440
No, actually, she didn't.

36
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,770
You can go ahead and tell him, babe.

37
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,180
Kevin, Kate and Kyle.

38
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,380
All Ks.

39
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,700
It's a good letter.

40
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,800
We had a good doctor.

41
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,160
Right, Bec?

42
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:51,930
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,970
I'm just, um, a little overwhelmed.

44
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,630
Thank you very much for everything.

45
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,010
Grandma and Grandpa are here!

46
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,710
Hi, Grandpa.

47
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,910
Hi, baby.

48
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,510
What are you guys doing here?

49
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,150
We were on our way into the city

50
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,980
and thought we'd stop by and say hi.

52
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,020
A friend at work gave us his Hamilton tickets.

53
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,270
Feel like I'm gonna be the one person

54
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,290
on the planet who doesn't like this damn thing.

55
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,020
- There's a man living with us.  - What?

56
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,660
Daddy's friend from work.

57
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,810
Come play Legos!

58
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,390
Yeah, come play Legos with us.

59
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,650
We're coming, we're coming.

60
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,840
I missed you.

61
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,690
This was not the plan.

62
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,080
What plan?

63
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,160
The plan for how I was gonna tell her that I found him.

64
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,790
I wasn't aware there was a plan for that, babe.

65
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,760
Well, there was.

66
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,110
I mean, there was gonna be.

67
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,550
The plan was forming, but now it's off.

68
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,540
Okay, so what are you gonna do now?

69
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,250
Right now? ?

70
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,610
I'm gonna put on a fake-ass smile.

71
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,610
I'm gonna ask to speak to my mother privately.

72
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,600
And then I'm gonna tell her something

73
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,940
that's gonna completely and utterly devastate her.

74
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,770
Mommy?

75
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,990
Can I talk to you privately?

76
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,660
- One second.  - ?Sure.

77
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,010
Everybody...

78
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,920
Holy hangover.

79
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,550
*And faces, and friendly faces*

80
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,530
*And still I had to be free*

81
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,250
*I've been to paradise*

82
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,210
*But I've never been to...*

83
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,410
?How's your face?

84
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,450
Well, it's fine.

85
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,970
Luckily, I have all this fat to soften the blow.

86
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,990
Stop that.

87
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,320
How's your breakfast?

88
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,540
You mean this, uh, steel-cut oatmeal

89
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,790
and egg white pancake with no salt, no sugar,

90
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,600
and no oil that you're making me eat?

91
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,790
Yes.

92
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,570
It's amazing.

93
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,590
Right? ?

94
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,580
It's the best thing I've ever tasted.

95
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,210
Quick question.

96
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,990
last night, after the party...

97
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,270
I kind of blacked out.

98
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,890
We didn't...

99
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,200
Oh, no.

100
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,920
A lot of vomiting

101
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,170
but not a lot of anything else.

102
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,480
Oh. Sexy.

103
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,280
You have an amazing voice, by the way.

104
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,340
I did not know that you sang.

105
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,560
Well, I did not know

106
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,880
that you spy on people in the bathroom.

107
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,690
Will you sing for me?

108
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,730
No.

109
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,350
Come on, Kate, come on.

110
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,830
Come on, come on. You're good.

111
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,590
And I'm not talking about karaoke-good.

112
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,060
I'm talking good-good.

113
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,700
Have-- did-- you-- did...

114
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,410
Did you ever perform?

115
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,440
When I was really young.

117
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,350
Cyndi Lauper was kind of my jam.

118
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,970
"Time after Time" cover was...

119
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,880
I rocked it. I was, you know...

120
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,250
I rocked it like it was my job.

121
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,490
?But then I grew up.

122
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,730
And then I grew...

123
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,550
and, um, you know,

124
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,590
I try to avoid the spotlight.

125
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,220
- Are you done? ? - Yes.

126
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,460
Are you?

127
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,550
One more song.

128
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,900
One more song.

129
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,080
- One more song. - Okay, Kate,

130
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,920
I am super pumped about this move to New York City.

131
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,410
I mean, we've got a ton to figure out,

132
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,160
of course, but I'm super pumped.

133
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,400
Wait... that was real?

134
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,670
Yeah. Stage acting, it's my new jam. Oh...

135
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,760
Do you think you could get that really cute, uh,

136
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,220
that theater casting director,

137
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,380
- the one who liked me. What's... - Cara.

138
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,300
Cara, yes. I love Cara... Yeah.

139
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,180
and when you get her on the phone,

140
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,460
tell her I'm only interested in doing heavy drama.

141
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,830
We're not moving all the way to New York City

142
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,350
so I can do some lame off-Broadway comedy.

143
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,720
You want me to go with you?

144
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,560
Of course. Yeah.

145
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,910
There's no way I could do this without you.

146
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,480
and maybe you should specify that I don't want to

147
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,260
do anything where I have to show my penis.

148
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,530
Toby.

149
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,900
I didn't see you there, man. What's up?

150
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,620
How's this? You know what we should do?

151
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,100
We should look into the Meatpacking District.

152
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,390
It's like an up and coming.

153
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,020
Pancakes are good.

154
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,700
Is she making you eat this?

155
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,870
I'm trying to have some sex.

156
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,570
So now he's been here for about a week.

157
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,830
I guess I just wanted to get used to the idea of him myself,

158
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,190
you know, before I told you,

159
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,050
and this has nothing to do with you or Dad--

160
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:31,550
I hope you know that.

161
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,930
I do know that, yes, of course. ?Okay, okay.

162
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,470
I mean, obviously, I've been curious about him

163
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,560
since I was a kid.

164
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,050
And I know you guys would have found him if you could have.

165
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,620
So who is he?

166
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,580
What did he tell you about himself?

167
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,440
His name is William.

168
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,000
That's it?

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,530
He didn't tell you anything else? ?

170
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,220
He has a cat.

171
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,760
Stomach cancer.

172
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,180
It's the basic gist of what I know so far.

173
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,320
Well, where is he?

174
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,860
I'd like to, uh, meet him.

175
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,490
- He's in Annie's room, but... - ?Okay.

176
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,920
I don't know if he's ready for company, Ma.

177
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,270
Hold on one second.

178
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,270
Okay.

179
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,010
Car seats are installed.

180
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,210
Policeman approved.

181
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,980
I'll pull up, we'll load up.

182
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,970
And then the adventure begins, yeah?

183
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,430
Okay.

184
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,940
If I were you, I would head right to Mexico.

185
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,240
If I don't come back, at least you'll know where to find me.

186
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,560
Wait.

187
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,030
Okay, let's lock and load.

188
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,180
Here, I got him. ?Yeah.

189
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,130
Oh. Come on, big boy.

190
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,150
Okay.

191
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,190
- I wanted to introdu... - ?Hi.

192
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,700
I'm Rebecca, I'm Randall's mother.

193
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,840
Very nice to meet you.

194
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,820
Nice to meet you, as well.

195
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,740
Sweetheart, could you give us just a moment to chat?

196
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,950
Yeah.

197
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,860
Thank you.

198
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,140
You look well.

200
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,590
It's okay, my little lady.

201
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,340
He's not taking my breast.

202
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,990
We just go put her over and wreathe her.

203
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,250
Can you help with him, please? He's being really fussy.

204
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,800
We have burping cloths. Look in their bedroom.

205
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,380
It's not... there's not... in here.

206
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,330
Please, just come back in here.

207
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,670
- I need you to help me, please. - Okay.

208
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,220
Are you laying down, Jack? ?

209
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,330
Can you please check on Kevin?

210
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,930
Why, why won't he stop crying?

211
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,090
They'll be in college soon.

212
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,670
?Which one?

213
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,030
Probably the one that hates me.

214
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,990
- He doesn't hate you. - Jack,

215
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,280
I think we're gonna have to start him on formula.

216
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,280
No. He's fine.

217
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,980
He won't take to my breast.

218
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,550
We have to treat them the same.

219
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,750
He's not the same.

220
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,900
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

221
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,830
He's just... He's not.

222
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,380
I grew the other two  inside of me,

223
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,870
and he feels like a stranger.

224
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,250
And I feel really terrible for saying that out loud,

225
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,630
but he just... he does.

226
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,040
Jack,

227
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,620
when we were leaving the hospital...

228
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,920
I know. You were having second thoughts about bringing him home.

229
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,740
It's fine.

230
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,780
- No. No, it's not that. I...  - It's natural.

231
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,500
He's fine, Bec.

232
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,920
He's fine.

233
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,890
Look at us.

234
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,450
I mean, I was a complete stranger.

235
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,430
Look how quickly I took to your breast.

236
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,620
You're an idiot. ?

237
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,100
Yeah. I'm your idiot.

238
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,100
Okay?

239
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,040
And they are our babies.

240
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,660
He's our baby.

241
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,720
Okay?

242
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,010
They'll be in college soon?

243
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,960
Any day now.

244
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,610
And then she just asked to speak to him alone.

245
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,890
- About what? - I don't know.

246
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,340
Whatever biological fathers and adopted mothers talk about.

248
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,380
- What is that? - The Knicks,

249
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,990
Beth. How the hell am I supposed to know?

250
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,740
I...

251
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,670
You love me so much that you're just gonna give me that one?

252
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,390
You know me so well, my friend.

253
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,990
I got to take him to that doctor's appointment in two hours.

254
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,010
God. What the hell do you think

255
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,180
- they're talking about, anyway? - I don't know, honey.

256
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,380
He found me.

257
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,000
- He brought me here. - But you stayed.

258
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,360
Yes, I stayed. ?

259
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,490
We had a deal.

260
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,270
I won't tell him, if that's what you're thinking.

261
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,530
Oh, God. All those...

262
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,830
It will break him.

263
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,620
It will. Knowing that he could've known you

264
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,340
and that I kept him from that.

265
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,800
Rebecca, the deal we made was the right one.

266
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,830
For everyone.

267
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,330
- If you hurt him... - ?I won't.

268
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,950
Fine, then.

269
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,300
But know this

270
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,990
my son,

271
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,080
who I raised,

272
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,790
is gonna put everything he has into trying to save you,

273
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,840
because that's who he is.

274
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,480
It's gonna come in front of his job,

275
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,330
in front of his marriage,

276
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,210
and in front of his time with his kids.

277
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,870
So you better damn well be worth that.

278
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Damn it.

279
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,460
Damn it.

280
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,280
Yes, um, it would be for an open-ended reservation,

281
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,950
until we can find him a rental.

282
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,350
And your pillows are hypoallergenic, yeah?

283
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,120
And can I just confirm that the hotel gym's not just, like,

284
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,770
three crappy elliptical machines?

285
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,750
'Cause he needs space for floor work and exercise

286
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,410
- and free weight... - Great.

287
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,630
You know, actually, can I just have pictures sent to me?

288
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,270
Hey, babe.

289
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,550
Have you seen my keys?

290
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,870
I think you left 'em in the plan you never made.

291
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,600
So she's funny, too. That's good. My keys.

292
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,270
So?

293
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,260
He seems very nice.

294
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,200
Honey,

295
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,030
we should get going if we're gonna get dinner

296
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,100
in the city first. ?Oh.

297
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,580
- I bet the tunnel's gonna be jammed. - ?Okay.

298
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,170
No, stay!

299
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,050
Dad's work friend doesn't eat a lot.

300
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,700
- You can have some of his dinner. - What?

301
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,710
Grandma and Grandpa can't stay, girls.

302
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,400
And, anyway, i've got an appointment with my work friend, so,

303
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,940
I promise to catch up with you about all this.

304
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,860
Promise?

305
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,860
Miguel, ?thanks for dropping by unexpectedly.

306
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,270
Rewind. Thanks for dropping by.

307
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,290
Always love it. Always love you guys. Peace.

308
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,250
He's hiding something.

309
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,990
Hey. We got to get goin'.

310
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,960
William?

311
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,400
William. Where you goin'?

312
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,650
- Home. - Why? What happened?

313
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,820
- We got the doctor's appointment. - You should cancel.

314
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,220
Why would I cancel... W-Will you get in the damn car?

315
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,570
I knew if I told you I was leaving, you'd try and stop me

316
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,830
like you are right now.

317
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,770
You'd try and stop me

318
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,680
'cause you were raised to be a good man.

319
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,690
But I wasn't the one who raised you that way, Randall.

320
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,560
I was reminded of that today.

321
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,430
That you have parents.

322
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,850
That I just can't step in 40 years later

323
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,790
and enjoy the fruits of someone else's labor.

324
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,440
So, just like that, you go?

325
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,810
No good-bye to the girls?

326
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,870
- The girls will be fine. - No, they'll be devastated.

327
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,410
They don't even know who I am.

328
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,720
- Look, this doctor... - He isn't gonna

329
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,330
tell me anything I don't already know.

330
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,480
- But he might. - ?He won't.

331
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,560
But he might.

332
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,640
And something tells me he might be a little more thorough

333
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,640
than the doctor at whatever free homeless clinic

334
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,910
you've been going to to get your free medical counsel at.

335
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,000
To say nothing of the fact that I had to kiss up

336
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,640
to the biggest D-bag at my firm

337
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,360
just to get you this appointment.

338
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,460
So, yes, William,

339
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,900
you are getting in the car right now,

340
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,400
and we are going to this doctor's appointment.

341
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,480
And then and only then will I give you permission

342
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,470
to hobble off like Hobo Joe without saying

343
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,050
so much as a good-bye.

344
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,960
Startin' to not feel so bad

345
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,160
about leaving you at that fire station.

346
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,440
Yeah, whatever.

347
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,070
Hi, white people.

348
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,340
Friendly neighborhood black man.

349
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,310
Kate, can I get one right here?

350
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,980
Kate? Right here? Can I just get one right here?

351
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,320
Kate? Who are you wearing?

352
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,350
- Kate? Kate? - What are you doing?

353
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,590
Is it true that you're dating Taylor Swift?

354
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,820
Is it true that you just broke up

355
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,470
with Taylor Swift just now?

356
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,150
What are you doing?

357
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,800
Give me just one day.

358
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,930
One day where you're the star.

359
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,410
Hey, where are you? I've called you, like, ten times.

360
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,950
Listen, um... Can we just hire one of those services

361
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,170
that comes in and, you know, packs everything for you?

362
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,050
I think Jason Momoa told me about a guy who does that.

363
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,710
Let's get that number from Momoa's office.

364
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,950
His assistant. That, uh...

365
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,180
Dahala Mapuana, I think her name was.

366
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,940
Or was it Patty?

367
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,730
You remember Jason Momoa. He's the, uh...

368
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,010
he's the original Dothraki guy.

369
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,260
We met him at Seth Green's house. Where are you, all right?

370
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,840
I'm getting overwhelmed. Pick up the phone.

372
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,470
Where are we going? ?

373
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,030
Well, no more background singing for you.

374
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,470
Your voice is way too beautiful

375
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,320
to only be heard in a bathroom.

376
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,580
Today is your day, babe.

377
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,550
We are on our way to your first big gig.

378
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,090
- What? - ?Yep, I, uh... I downloaded

379
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,600
an instrumental copy of "Time after Time,"

380
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,200
found an old boom box.

381
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,960
It's showtime, baby! ?

382
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,640
Toby, there is no way in hell

383
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,300
that I'm gonna sing in front of people.

384
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,500
Well, then you'll be depriving the world.

385
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,870
Well, the world will live.

386
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,950
Yes, but your audience may not.

387
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,430
All right.

389
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,980
?What the hell?

390
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,710
Okay, so,

391
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,190
my Aunt Dolly actually lives here.

392
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,670
All right, I booked you in their prime slot, 3:00 p.m.

393
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,950
It's right after Jell-O but before their nap.

394
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,300
Perfect place to break your seal, right?

395
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,150
Now, remember, most of 'em will probably be asleep.

396
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,760
The rest won't remember this tomorrow.

397
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,170
And most of them lived through World War II,

398
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,660
so no matter how bad you are, they've seen worse.

399
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,720
Come on.

400
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,940
I'm sorry, do you need the red carpet?

401
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,490
- No. - ?Okay, come on.

402
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,830
Well, now,

403
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,830
all three of these babies are looking very good, Jack.

404
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,150
Very strong, very healthy.

405
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,460
Okay, good. That's good. 'Cause some-sometimes

406
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,350
one does something different than the other two.

407
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,790
You just... you start spinnin' a little... ?

408
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,860
They're all doing very well.

409
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:06,810
Okay.

410
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,030
How are you guys doing?

411
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,210
We're great. We're good. We're, um...

412
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,710
tired but, uh, good.

413
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,340
And Rebecca?

414
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,100
I mean, I only ask because

415
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,060
it's a little unusual for the father to be here alone.

416
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,990
She just needed a little break, you know?

417
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:33,310
She's... she's... she's not totally herself.

418
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,460
I mean, she's a...

419
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,390
little dazed,I guess?

420
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,260
She's not bonding with the babies.

421
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,020
And not with Kyle, mainly. You know? Not with Kyle.

422
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,860
I think she might be a little broken.

423
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,270
You know, I-I think the babies might have broken my wife.

424
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,980
You can fix her, right?

425
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,450
Or you can tell me how to fix her? I was... I was hoping

426
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,790
- you could tell me how to fix her. - Sit down, Jack.

427
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,050
She lost a baby, Jack.

428
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,140
You can't just dismiss that.

429
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,340
- So did I. ?- Yeah.

430
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,700
And you took your grief, and you... channeled it into action.

431
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,400
You willed yourself forward with positivity,

432
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,320
but Rebecca has just...

433
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,250
She's gonna have to do this in her own way,

434
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,780
and you're just gonna have to give her the space to do it.

435
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,730
Yeah. What if she doesn't find her way?

436
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,260
- She will. - ?How do you know?

437
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,960
For the same reason that I know

438
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,150
you're gonna give her the space to find it.

439
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,490
'Cause I believe in good people.

442
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,020
so you got to take everything I say with a grain of salt.

443
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,470
Now, look, there's a couch in there in my office.

444
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,050
Why don't you go lie down, take a nap?

445
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,390
I'm-I'm totally free the rest of the day.

446
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,840
I can use the time with my namesakes.

447
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,950
No, there's three. You don't... you don't...

448
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,780
I brought them into the world, Jack.

449
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,900
I am perfectly qualified to sit here and watch 'em sleep

450
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,170
and crap themselves for a couple of hours.

451
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,550
Now go. Now.

452
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,250
Hi. Sorry to bother you. I'm looking for someone.

453
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,510
he's Afro-American, very, very thin.

454
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,900
Possibly on drugs.

455
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,830
You know what? I sound ridiculous.

456
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,310
Sorry. I sound so stupid.

457
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,850
You mean Shakespeare? You looking for him?

458
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,490
Come on, get in.

459
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,930
All right. Uh, good afternoon, ladies and germs.

460
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,700
Uh, my name is Toby.

461
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,100
I'm actually, uh, Dolly's nephew.

462
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,700
Everybody knows Aunt Dolly, right?

463
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,580
Wave for everybody, Dolly. Hello, Dolly!

464
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,180
Be careful, gentlemen. She's a real man-eater.

465
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,490
Aren't you, Dolly?

466
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,990
Okay. Okay, well, we have a very

467
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,180
special treat for you this afternoon.

468
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,620
The lady that I am about to introduce

470
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,700
Adele admires her, Streisand considers her a friend,

471
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,190
J. Lo wishes she had that ass.

472
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:49,140
Ladies and gentlemen, performing for one song only,

473
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,040
I give you... Kate!

474
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,610
All right, here we go.

475
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,000
That's for you.

476
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,630
- Really? You want me to...? - ?Yup.

477
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:19,920
*Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick*

478
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,450
*And think of you*

479
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:28,050
*Caught up in circles*

480
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,260
*Confusion is nothing new*

481
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:38,990
*Flashback to warm nights*

482
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,260
*Almost left behind*

483
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:49,470
*Suitcase of memory*

484
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,710
*Time after*

485
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:57,100
*Sometimes you picture me*

487
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:02,650
*I'm walking too far ahead*

488
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,710
*You're calling to me*

489
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,390
*And I can't hear*

490
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:14,360
*What you've said*

491
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,250
*And you say, go slow*

492
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,880
Hey. I'm looking for Shakespeare.

493
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,230
*I fall behind*

494
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:30,050
*The drum beats out of time*

495
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:38,030
*If you're lost you can look and you will find me*

496
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:41,590
*Time after time*

497
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,110
*If you fall I will catch you*

498
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,520
*I'll be waiting*

499
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,830
*Time after time*

500
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,960
*If you fall I will catch you*

501
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,760
*I'll be waiting*

502
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:03,430
*Time after time*

503
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,950
*Time after time*

504
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,340
Yeah! Come on!

505
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,480
Give it up! ?

506
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,990
Oh. Oh, if I had known.

507
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,100
I would have... I would have

508
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,700
taken you to the nursing home for every date.

509
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,030
- Shut up. ?- Okay.

510
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,340
No. No, no, just shut it off.

511
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,730
?Just shut it off!

512
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,840
What?

513
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,990
- Oh, my sister was so right about... - Elaine's here.

514
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,780
She's trashing the joint. I'm locked in the closet.

515
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,430
Insane Elaine? Why is she there?

516
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,710
I called her.

517
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,430
How?

518
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,490
I deleted her number from your contacts.

519
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,060
I found it in the Cloud.

520
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,880
You called Insane Elaine?

521
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,270
And I had sex with her.

522
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,940
And I told her I was moving to New York,

523
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,290
- and then she went crazy. - I am not crazy!

524
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,160
Why does everyone call me crazy?! Why?!

525
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,850
You know what? Um, I got a little overwhelmed with the move,

526
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,920
you know, I tried calling you, but you're not picking up.

527
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,510
Oh, God.

528
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,750
You know what? She's breaking things again. Get over here.

529
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,770
I will be right over.

530
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,170
I am...

531
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,230
I'm sorry. I have to go.

532
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,860
Oh, but really, you don't,

533
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,070
and it's kind of crazy that you think that you do.

534
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,890
Toby, you don't get it.

535
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,500
We're-we're twins. We're not like regular people.

536
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,020
When I was a kid, broke my arm

537
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,950
and he cried out in pain ten miles away, right?

538
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,840
We're that connected.

539
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:37,000
I thought we were, too, is the thing.

540
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:41,120
Kate, I'm not some nut job who performs grand gestures

541
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,810
for every girl that I go on a few dates with.

542
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,820
I like you, Kate. I like you a lot.

543
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,340
But I can't... I can't play second banana to your brother.

544
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,050
You have to.

545
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,740
Everyone has to.

546
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,670
Great.

547
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,520
Have a good time in New York!

548
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,370
William, will you join me out here?

549
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,390
William.

550
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,520
Randall. I wish I had better news.

551
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,790
The cancer has metastasized

552
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,500
to a point where there's really not much we can do.

553
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,210
There are some experimental treatments.

554
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,350
Frankly, they haven't been very promising.

555
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,950
I'm not very well, as you can probably tell.

556
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,880
The baby didn't come from this.

557
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,200
It came from love.

558
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,510
His mother?

559
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,240
You know, we-we... we met on that bus, actually.

560
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,800
My world spun on every axis that day.

561
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,700
I read poetry to her the first time we talked.

562
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,200
Uh, not any of mine.

563
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,660
I was too shy for that.

564
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,570
One of my favorite poets, and...

565
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,370
She used to love it when I read to her.

566
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,100
So what'd you name the baby?

567
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,800
Kyle.

568
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,320
I was having triplets, and, um,

569
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,040
on a whim, actually, we just decided to name them.

570
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,780
Kevin, Kate and Kyle.

571
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,810
I... I lost one of the babies during delivery,

572
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,870
but your baby showed up

573
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,860
at the hospital the very same morning.

574
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,790
It felt like destiny.

575
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,110
Um... I just...

576
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,340
I appreciate this. I-I, um...

577
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,330
I wanted to know his story.

578
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,690
And that there was good here, so...

579
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,350
I wonder if I could check on him from time to time.

580
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,850
No. No.

581
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,310
I-I also need to know...

582
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,870
I need to know that you're not gonna come back for him.

583
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,870
I need to know that I can move forward.

584
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,330
Because he will have your blood

585
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,690
and the blanket you wrapped him up in, but that's it.

586
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,880
That's the deal. Otherwise, I...

587
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,950
I understand.

588
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,380
Okay.

589
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,810
I'm not...

590
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,390
I'm not bonding with the baby.

591
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:14,310
I want to love him like he's my own,

592
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,680
but every time I look at his face...

593
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,410
Give him his own name.

594
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:38,070
What was the name of the poet you used to read to her?

595
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,340
Your favorite poet.

597
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,830
Maybe you'll see fit to give it to him someday.

598
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,110
Thank you.

599
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,380
How'd it go?

600
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,970
It's bad.

601
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,120
Nothing to be done, really.

602
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,240
Some experimental treatments

603
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,010
that'll give him a few more months.

604
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,360
He's upstairs resting.

605
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,580
Peacefully with his arms crossed over his chest, no doubt.

606
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,810
I have no idea how I came from that man.

607
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,250
I'm so sorry, babe.

608
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,000
Yeah, I don't know what I expected.

609
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,570
Yes, I do.

610
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,960
I expected to find a father who wasn't so damn sick.

611
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,470
- Randall... - I should have looked for him years ago, Beth.

612
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,710
I mean, the girls could have had a grandfather all this time.

613
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,570
Instead, I brought him here so they could what?

614
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,390
Fall in love with a dying man.

615
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,400
So, this is about the girls, then?

616
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,920
You don't want them to fall in love with him?

617
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,350
He's been here a week, baby.

618
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,700
And you don't know any more about him

619
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,970
than you did the first time he walked through that door.

620
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,480
I don't know what you were looking for with all this,

621
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,010
or even if you do,

622
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:34,070
but I do know you don't have a whole lot of time.

623
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,020
- Is she gone? - ?Yeah.

624
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,160
God, I hope the booty call was worth it.

625
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,270
It was.

626
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,150
I just started to get overwhelmed, you know?

627
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,080
Started reading one of those plays you gave me.

628
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,550
You actually read one?

629
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,410
I read them all, actually.

630
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:28,240
But, uh, this one, though, it's really good, you know?

631
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,600
Like, really good.

632
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,420
And I just started to get a little overwhelmed

633
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,810
'cause I felt like, um,

634
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,370
I felt like maybe it was too good for me.

635
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,420
It's not, Kevin.

636
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,350
It's not-- they would be lucky.

637
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,430
Well...

638
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:50,890
So my guy turned out to be more insane than Elaine.

639
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,160
- Toby? - ?Get this.

640
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,710
So he takes me to a nursing home...

641
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,530
to sing in front of old people.

642
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,880
So I'd be a star but in a comfortable environment,

643
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,360
'cause otherwise I would freak out.

644
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,990
It was the whole works.

645
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,410
He had the red carpet, he had the car, suit.

646
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,640
- It was like... - Oh, that's good.

647
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,070
Yeah. And then afterwards,

648
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,770
like, I was on a high, like,

649
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,170
I know it sounds stupid, but I, I felt so free.

650
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,040
Then what happened?

651
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,390
Well, you called.

652
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,510
Told him I had to go and he got pouty and mean.

653
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,940
Wait a minute, I called at that very moment

654
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,130
and you actually answered the phone?

655
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,260
Of course I answered.

656
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,640
Anyway, I need to focus on losing weight

657
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,360
and our big move to New York,

658
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,170
and I don't even need to be in a relationship.

659
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:42,790
You're fired.

660
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,300
What?

661
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,210
Yeah, Kate, you're fired.

662
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,010
Why?

663
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,140
You're the personal assistant to your brother, all right?

664
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,530
A brother who locks himself in his master bedroom closet.

665
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,480
A master bedroom closet

666
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,130
that happens to have a mini-bar in it.

667
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:07,630
Maybe it's time we go at it alone for a while, you know?

668
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,590
Just for a little while to see what happens.

669
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,710
You know, maybe we need to grow up a bit.

670
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,810
I don't really know who I am if I'm not your sister.

671
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,590
I do.

672
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:33,670
You're gonna love her.

673
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,160
I don't like it when you're sweet.

674
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,850
Okay, I'm here. What?

675
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,030
I'm sorry.

676
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,840
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't change the fact...

677
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,670
What you did for me today was the nicest thing

678
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,870
that anyone has ever done for me.

679
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:08,720
Okay, but that still doesn't...

680
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,820
And I'm not moving to New York.

681
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,820
- Okay, but that still doesn't change... - I got you something.

682
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,660
I accept your apology.

683
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,210
- Yeah? - ?Yes.

684
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,730
Don't you dare answer that.

685
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,090
I'm not.

686
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,890
- Do not. - ?I won't.

687
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,160
Leave a message for Kate.

688
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,570
Oh, Kate, good. You didn't answer.

689
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,960
Hopefully, that means you're having sex.

690
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,320
Anyway, I did it.

691
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,880
I-I booked a red-eye to New York.

692
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,780
I'm just gonna do it, 'cause, you know...

693
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,350
Kate, if we keep talking about it,

694
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,440
we'll talk ourselves out of it.

695
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,350
I'll never go.

696
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,590
You'll never stay, so...

697
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,890
And I'm not gonna say good-bye

698
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,670
or anything sappy like that.

699
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,000
You know how I feel.

700
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,000
Okay.

701
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,920
You know, I didn't know where you were the last four hours.

702
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,100
I know.

703
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,580
I'm sorry.

704
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,810
I thought you ran off to Mexico

705
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,010
and abandoned the kids.

706
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,030
I would never run off to Mexico

707
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,080
and abandon the kids without you.

708
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,990
Promise?

709
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,100
I promise.

710
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,080
I can't stop thinking about the one we lost, Jack.

711
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,290
I can't. I know...

712
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,020
I know we have these new babies, and I should be happy,

713
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,540
but I just can't stop thinking about him.

714
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:00,710
Me, too.

715
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,790
- Yeah? ?- Yeah.

716
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,940
That's all I think about.

717
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,380
I feel... ?

718
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,910
I feel guilty when I think about him,

719
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,490
and then, you know, I-I feel guilty

720
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:15,310
when I stop thinking about him.

721
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,420
Me, too.

722
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,180
I thought it was just me.

723
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,940
No. It's me, too.

724
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,310
I love you.

725
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,310
I love you, too.

726
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,100
I think we need to give him a new name.

727
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,350
I think it's important.

728
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,010
Where'd you get that idea?

729
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,000
I just thought of it.

730
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,390
Come in.

731
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm sorry today didn't go as we hoped.

732
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,820
I'm not done yet, though.

733
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,630
There's more than one big-shot oncologist in New York.

734
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,220
Okay.

735
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,950
I'd like to tell the girls who you are.

736
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,330
I was thinking maybe first thing tomorrow.

737
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,120
They'll have a lot of questions.

738
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,660
Whatever they want to know.

739
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:53,910
Okay.

740
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,060
How'd you meet my mother?

741
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,590
On a bus, of all places.

742
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,500
My God, she looked beautiful.

743
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,860
And let me tell you...

744
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,580
You okay?

745
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,410
Yeah, he's okay.

746
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,060
I'm okay.

747
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,300
Hey, sweet boy.

748
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,300
You want to try?

749
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,320
Hi, Randall... Hi.

753
