00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,720
你想让我跟你一起去吗
You want me to go with you?

144
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,560
当然
Of course. Yeah.

145
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,910
没有你我什么事情都做不了
There's no way I could do this without you.

146
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,480
也许你还得跟他们明确
and maybe you should specify that I don't want to

147
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,260
我不想做任何需要展示我的鸡巴的事
do anything where I have to show my penis.

148
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,530
托比
Toby.

149
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,900
我不知道你也在这  老兄  怎么了
I didn't see you there, man. What's up?

150
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,620
这个好吃吗  你知道我们要做什么吗
How's this? You know what we should do?

151
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,100
我们应该去曼哈顿肉库区看看
We should look into the Meatpacking District.

152
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,390
前途无量啊
It's like an up and coming.

153
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,020
煎饼很不错
Pancakes are good.

154
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,700
她逼你吃这种东西吗
Is she making you eat this?

155
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,870
我在争取和她上床
I'm trying to have some sex.

156
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,570
他来家里快一周了
So now he's been here for about a week.

157
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,830
我想试着去习惯他这个人的存在
I guess I just wanted to get used to the idea of him myself,

158
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,190
之后再把这事告诉你们
you know, before I told you,

159
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,050
但这与你和爸爸没有任何关系
and this has nothing to do with you or Dad--

160
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:31,550
我希望你能理解
I hope you know that.

161
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,930
我能理解  我当然理解  好了
I do know that, yes, of course. ?Okay, okay.

162
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,470
很显然  我从很小的时候
I mean, obviously, I've been curious about him

163
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,560
就对他感到好奇
since I was a kid.

164
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,050
我知道你们如果能找的话早就找到他了
And I know you guys would have found him if you could have.

165
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,620
那么他是谁
So who is he?

166
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,580
他的身世和你说过多少
What did he tell you about himself?

167
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,440
他叫威廉
His name is William.

168
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,000
只有名字吗
That's it?

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,530
他没告诉你别的事吗
He didn't tell you anything else? ?

170
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,220
他养了一只猫
He has a cat.

171
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,760
他得了胃癌
Stomach cancer.

172
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,180
目前为止我只知道这些
It's the basic gist of what I know so far.

173
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,320
他在哪呢
Well, where is he?

174
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,860
我想见见他
I'd like to, uh, meet him.

175
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,490
-他在安妮的房间  可是...  -好的
- He's in Annie's room, but... - ?Okay.

176
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,920
我不知道他是否准备好见客人  妈妈
I don't know if he's ready for company, Ma.

177
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,270
等一下
Hold on one second.

178
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,270
好了
Okay.

179
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,010
汽车座椅安好了
Car seats are installed.

180
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,210
警察批准了
Policeman approved.

181
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,980
我把车开过来  然后上车
I'll pull up, we'll load up.

182
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,970
我们的冒险从此就开始了  好吗
And then the adventure begins, yeah?

183
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,430
好的
Okay.

184
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,940
我要是你就头也不回地去墨西哥
If I were you, I would head right to Mexico.

185
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,240
要是我没回来  你至少知道去哪找我
If I don't come back, at least you'll know where to find me.

186
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,560
等等
Wait.

187
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,030
好了  快上车吧
Okay, let's lock and load.

188
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,180
来  我抱他
Here, I got him. ?Yeah.

189
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,130
来吧  大男孩
Oh. Come on, big boy.

190
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,150
好了
Okay.

191
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,190
-我想给你介绍...  -你好
- I wanted to introdu... - ?Hi.

192
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,700
我是丽贝卡  兰德尔的妈妈
I'm Rebecca, I'm Randall's mother.

193
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,840
很高兴认识你
Very nice to meet you.

194
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,820
我也很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you, as well.

195
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,740
亲爱的  能让我俩单独谈谈吗
Sweetheart, could you give us just a moment to chat?

196
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,950
好的
Yeah.

197
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,860
谢谢
Thank you.

198
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,140
你气色不错
You look well.

199
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,080
{\an8}我们的生活
第一季  第三集

200
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,590
别害怕  我的小美女
It's okay, my little lady.

201
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,340
他不喝我的奶
He's not taking my breast.

202
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,990
我们把她翻过来  然后裹住她
We just go put her over and wreathe her.

203
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,250
帮帮我吧  他太难哄了
Can you help with him, please? He's being really fussy.

204
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,800
家里有围嘴  去他们的卧室找找
We have burping cloths. Look in their bedroom.

205
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,380
没找到  不在这
It's not... there's not... in here.

206
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,330
你快回来吧
Please, just come back in here.

207
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,670
-快来帮帮我  -好的
- I need you to help me, please. - Okay.

208
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,220
你躺下了吗  杰克
Are you laying down, Jack? ?

209
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,330
你去看看凯文好吗
Can you please check on Kevin?

210
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,930
为什么  他为什么哭个不停
Why, why won't he stop crying?

211
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,090
他们一转眼就上大学了
They'll be in college soon.

212
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,670
是哪个
?Which one?

213
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,030
大概是讨厌我的那个吧
Probably the one that hates me.

214
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,990
-他不讨厌你  -杰克
- He doesn't hate you. - Jack,

215
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,280
我想我们得开始喂他奶粉了
I think we're gonna have to start him on formula.

216
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,280
不用  他很好
No. He's fine.

217
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,980
他不喝我的奶
He won't take to my breast.

218
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,550
我们得用相同的方式对待他们
We have to treat them the same.

219
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,750
可他并不相同
He's not the same.

220
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,900
对不起  对不起
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

221
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,830
他不一样
He's just... He's not.

222
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,380
另外两个孩子是在我肚子里长大的
I grew the other two  inside of me,

223
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,870
可他却像个外人
and he feels like a stranger.

224
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,250
虽然这么说我真的很难过
And I feel really terrible for saying that out loud,

225
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,630
可我真的这么认为
but he just... he does.

226
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,040
杰克
Jack,

227
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,620
我们离开医院的时候
when we were leaving the hospital...

228
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,920
我知道  你考虑过不带他回家
I know. You were having second thoughts about bringing him home.

229
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,740
没关系的
It's fine.

230
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,780
-不  不是这样的  -这很正常
- No. No, it's not that. I...  - It's natural.

231
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,500
他没问题  小贝
He's fine, Bec.

232
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,920
他没问题的
He's fine.

233
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,890
你看我们俩
Look at us.

234
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,450
我以前也就是个陌生人
I mean, I was a complete stranger.

235
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,430
但你的胸不也很快被我攻下了
Look how quickly I took to your breast.

236
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,620
你就是个笨蛋
You're an idiot. ?

237
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,100
对啊  我是你的小笨蛋
Yeah. I'm your idiot.

238
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,100
行了吧
Okay?

239
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,040
他们是我们的孩子
And they are our babies.

240
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,660
他也是我们的孩子
He's our baby.

241
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,720
好吗
Okay?

242
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,010
他们很快就去上大学了吧
They'll be in college soon?

243
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,960
指日可待
Any day now.

244
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,610
然后她就说要和他单独谈谈了
And then she just asked to speak to him alone.

245
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,890
-谈什么呢  -我不知道
- About what? - I don't know.

246
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,340
就亲生父亲和养母该谈的事吧
Whatever biological fathers and adopted mothers talk about.

247
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,380
{\an8}NBA尼克斯队命名由来

248
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,380
-那是什么  -尼克斯旧货商什么的
- What is that? - The Knicks,

249
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,990
贝丝  我怎么会知道他们在谈什么
Beth. How the hell am I supposed to know?

250
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,740
我...
I...

251
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,670
你这么爱我  你一定会给我亲亲的
You love me so much that you're just gonna give me that one?

252
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,390
你真了解我  朋友
You know me so well, my friend.

253
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,990
再过两小时我还要带他去看医生
I got to take him to that doctor's appointment in two hours.

254
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,010
天啊  你觉得
God. What the hell do you think

255
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,180
-他们究竟谈什么  -我不知道  亲爱的
- they're talking about, anyway? - I don't know, honey.

256
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,380
是他找到我的
He found me.

257
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,000
-他带我来这儿  -但是你在这儿住了
- He brought me here. - But you stayed.

258
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,360
是的  我住下了
Yes, I stayed. ?

259
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,490
我们之前约定好的
We had a deal.

260
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,270
我不会告诉他的  如果你担心这个的话
I won't tell him, if that's what you're thinking.

261
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,530
天啊  那一切...
Oh, God. All those...

262
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,830
会让他崩溃的
It will break him.

263
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,620
绝对会  要是他知道他本可以认识你
It will. Knowing that he could've known you

264
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,340
却被我横中阻拦了
and that I kept him from that.

265
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,800
丽贝卡  我们的约定是明智之举
Rebecca, the deal we made was the right one.

266
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,830
对每个人都好
For everyone.

267
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,330
-如果你敢伤害他...  -我不会的 
- If you hurt him... - ?I won't.

268
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,950
那就好
Fine, then.

269
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,300
不过你记住
But know this

270
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,990
我儿子
my son,

271
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,080
我抚养成人的他
who I raised,

272
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,790
肯定会竭尽全力来救你
is gonna put everything he has into trying to save you,

273
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,840
因为这就是他的为人
because that's who he is.

274
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,480
他会把这事看得比工作还重要
It's gonna come in front of his job,

275
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,330
也比婚姻更重要
in front of his marriage,

276
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,210
甚至比他在家陪孩子还重要
and in front of his time with his kids.

277
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,870
所以你最好不要辜负他
So you better damn well be worth that.

278
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
该死的
Damn it.

279
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,460
该死的
Damn it.

280
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,280
是  在我们帮他租到房子之前
Yes, um, it would be for an open-ended reservation,

281
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,950
都要无限期地预订这房间
until we can find him a rental.

282
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,350
你们那儿的枕头不会过敏吧
And your pillows are hypoallergenic, yeah?

283
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,120
还有我想确认下酒店的健身房
And can I just confirm that the hotel gym's not just, like,

284
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,770
该不会只有三台旧跑步机吧
three crappy elliptical machines?

285
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,750
因为他需要场地做俯卧撑之类的锻炼
'Cause he needs space for floor work and exercise

286
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,410
-还有力量训练...  -很好
- and free weight... - Great.

287
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,630
或者  你方便发几张照片给我看下吗
You know, actually, can I just have pictures sent to me?

288
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,270
宝贝
Hey, babe.

289
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,550
你看见我钥匙了吗
Have you seen my keys?

290
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,870
钥匙估计落在你那空头计划里了吧
I think you left 'em in the plan you never made.

291
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,600
你还挺幽默  不错啊  钥匙在这儿呢
So she's funny, too. That's good. My keys.

292
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,270
怎么样
So?

293
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,260
他人很好
He seems very nice.

294
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,200
亲爱的
Honey,

295
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,030
要在市区吃晚饭的话
we should get going if we're gonna get dinner

296
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,100
我们得赶紧走了
in the city first. ?Oh.

297
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,580
-我敢说那隧道肯定会堵车  -好吧
- I bet the tunnel's gonna be jammed. - ?Okay.

298
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,170
不要  留下来嘛
No, stay!

299
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,050
爸爸的同事吃不了多少的
Dad's work friend doesn't eat a lot.

300
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,700
-你们可以吃他那份  -真的吗
- You can have some of his dinner. - What?

301
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,710
爷爷奶奶要走了  宝贝女儿们
Grandma and Grandpa can't stay, girls.

302
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,400
况且一会儿我和同事还有事要出去呢
And, anyway, i've got an appointment with my work friend, so,

303
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,940
我保证后面会找你好好聊一聊的
I promise to catch up with you about all this.

304
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,860
说好咯
Promise?

305
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,860
米格尔  感谢你的不期而至
Miguel, ?thanks for dropping by unexpectedly.

306
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,270
重说  感谢顺路拜访
Rewind. Thanks for dropping by.

307
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,290
超爱这招  永远爱你们哦  再见
Always love it. Always love you guys. Peace.

308
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,250
他在隐瞒什么
He's hiding something.

309
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,990
我们该走了
Hey. We got to get goin'.

310
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,960
威廉
William?

311
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,400
威廉  你要去哪
William. Where you goin'?

312
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,650
-回家  -为什么  发生了什么事
- Home. - Why? What happened?

313
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,820
-我们预约了医生的  -你该取消
- We got the doctor's appointment. - You should cancel.

314
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,220
我为什么要取消...  你能上车吗
Why would I cancel... W-Will you get in the damn car?

315
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,570
我知道如果我告诉你我要离开  你会阻止我
I knew if I told you I was leaving, you'd try and stop me

316
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,830
正像现在这样
like you are right now.

317
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,770
你会设法阻止我
You'd try and stop me

318
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,680
是因为你父母教育你要做个好人
'cause you were raised to be a good man.

319
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,690
但那样养育你的人不是我  兰德尔
But I wasn't the one who raised you that way, Randall.

320
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,560
我今天想起来了
I was reminded of that today.

321
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,430
你有父母
That you have parents.

322
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,850
我不能在四十年后突然出现
That I just can't step in 40 years later

323
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,790
坐享别人的劳动成果
and enjoy the fruits of someone else's labor.

324
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,440
就这样了  你要走
So, just like that, you go?

325
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,810
不跟孩子们告个别
No good-bye to the girls?

326
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,870
-她们会没事的  -不  她们会很难过
- The girls will be fine. - No, they'll be devastated.

327
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,410
她们连我是谁都不知道
They don't even know who I am.

328
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,720
-听着  这个医生...-他要说的
- Look, this doctor... - He isn't gonna

329
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,330
我早就知道了
tell me anything I don't already know.

330
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,480
-但有可能  -不会的
- But he might. - ?He won't.

331
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,560
有可能
But he might.

332
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,640
而且我觉得他应该比
And something tells me he might be a little more thorough

333
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,640
你在哪个免费流动诊所找的庸医
than the doctor at whatever free homeless clinic

334
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,910
更了解你的病情
you've been going to to get your free medical counsel at.

335
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,000
更不用说为了帮你预约到他
To say nothing of the fact that I had to kiss up

336
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,640
我不得不去找公司里头号混蛋
to the biggest D-bag at my firm

337
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,360
拍马屁讨好他
just to get you this appointment.

338
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,460
所以没错  威廉
So, yes, William,

339
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,900
你现在就得上车
you are getting in the car right now,

340
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,400
然后我们去见这位医生
and we are going to this doctor's appointment.

341
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,480
然后我才能允许你
And then and only then will I give you permission

342
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,470
招呼都不打一声  就像个流浪汉一样
to hobble off like Hobo Joe without saying

343
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,050
一瘸一拐地走掉
so much as a good-bye.

344
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,960
把你丢在消防局这件事
Startin' to not feel so bad

345
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,160
现在没那么让我感到愧疚了
about leaving you at that fire station.

346
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,440
随便吧
Yeah, whatever.

347
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,070
白人们
Hi, white people.

348
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,340
我只是个友好的黑人邻居
Friendly neighborhood black man.

349
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,310
凯特  能在这拍一张吗
Kate, can I get one right here?

350
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,980
凯特  就在这  能给你拍一张吗
Kate? Right here? Can I just get one right here?

351
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,320
凯特  你穿的什么牌子
Kate? Who are you wearing?

352
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,350
-凯特  凯特  -你在干什么
- Kate? Kate? - What are you doing?

353
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,590
你真的在和泰勒・斯威夫特约会吗
Is it true that you're dating Taylor Swift?

354
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,820
你真的刚和泰勒・斯威夫特
Is it true that you just broke up

355
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,470
分手了吗
with Taylor Swift just now?

356
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,150
你在做什么
What are you doing?

357
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,800
给我一天时间
Give me just one day.

358
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,930
今天你是明星
One day where you're the star.

359
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,410
你在哪  我给你打了十来次电话了
Hey, where are you? I've called you, like, ten times.

360
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,950
听着  我们能雇人帮忙
Listen, um... Can we just hire one of those services

361
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,170
来家里打包东西吗
that comes in and, you know, packs everything for you?

362
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,050
我记得杰森・莫玛告诉我有个人专门干这个
I think Jason Momoa told me about a guy who does that.

363
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,710
我们赶紧找莫玛办公室的人问问他的电话
Let's get that number from Momoa's office.

364
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,950
他的助理...
His assistant. That, uh...

365
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,180
达哈拉・玛普哈纳  她好像叫这个
Dahala Mapuana, I think her name was.

366
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,940
要不就是帕蒂
Or was it Patty?

367
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,730
你记得杰森・莫玛吧  他是...
You remember Jason Momoa. He's the, uh...

368
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,010
他演的那个土著多斯拉克人
he's the original Dothraki guy.

369
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,260
我们在赛斯・格林家见过他  你在哪儿
We met him at Seth Green's house. Where are you, all right?

370
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,840
我快受不了了  赶紧接电话
I'm getting overwhelmed. Pick up the phone.

371
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,930
{\an8}10个未接来电

372
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,470
我们这是去哪
Where are we going? ?

373
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,030
别再偷偷唱歌了
Well, no more background singing for you.

374
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,470
你的声音太美妙了
Your voice is way too beautiful

375
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,320
只能在卫生间听到太可惜了
to only be heard in a bathroom.

376
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,580
今天你是主角  宝贝
Today is your day, babe.

377
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,550
我们正往你的第一个演出现场走
We are on our way to your first big gig.

378
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,090
-什么  -没错  我下载了
- What? - ?Yep, I, uh... I downloaded

379
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,600
《反反复复》的伴奏音乐
an instrumental copy of "Time after Time,"

380
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,200
找到个老式手提录音机
found an old boom box.

381
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,960
表演时间到  亲爱的
It's showtime, baby! ?

382
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,640
托比  我绝对不会
Toby, there is no way in hell

383
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,300
在一群人面前唱歌的
that I'm gonna sing in front of people.

384
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,500
那你就辜负了整个世界
Well, then you'll be depriving the world.

385
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,870
那世界不会有什么损失
Well, the world will live.

386
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,950
没错  可你的听众却损失了
Yes, but your audience may not.

387
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,430
到了
All right.

388
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,130
{\an8}梅厄老年人看护中心

389
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,980
搞什么鬼
?What the hell?

390
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,710
好了
Okay, so,

391
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,190
我的多莉姑姑就住在这里
my Aunt Dolly actually lives here.

392
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,670
我帮你约了下午三点的黄金到访时间
All right, I booked you in their prime slot, 3:00 p.m.

393
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,950
在他们吃果冻之后  午睡之前
It's right after Jell-O but before their nap.

394
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,300
首演的绝佳地点吧
Perfect place to break your seal, right?

395
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,150
记住  大多数人可能都昏昏欲睡了
Now, remember, most of 'em will probably be asleep.

396
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,760
没睡的人明天也会忘得一干二净
The rest won't remember this tomorrow.

397
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,170
而且他们大多都经历过二战
And most of them lived through World War II,

398
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,660
所以无论你唱得有多烂  他们都会不介意
so no matter how bad you are, they've seen worse.

399
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,720
来吧
Come on.

400
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,940
抱歉  需要为你铺个红毯吗
I'm sorry, do you need the red carpet?

401
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,490
-不用  -好了  来吧
- No. - ?Okay, come on.

402
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,830
瞧瞧
Well, now,

403
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,830
三个宝宝看上去都很棒  杰克
all three of these babies are looking very good, Jack.

404
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,150
强壮又健康
Very strong, very healthy.

405
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,460
那就好  那就好  因为有时候
Okay, good. That's good. 'Cause some-sometimes

406
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,350
一个宝宝的行为和另外两个不同
one does something different than the other two.

407
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,790
你就会...  胡思乱想
You just... you start spinnin' a little... ?

408
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,860
他们都非常健康
They're all doing very well.

409
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:06,810
好吧
Okay.

410
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,030
你俩最近如何
How are you guys doing?

411
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,210
还不错  是的  我们...
We're great. We're good. We're, um...

412
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,710
很疲惫  但还不错
tired but, uh, good.

413
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,340
丽贝卡怎么样
And Rebecca?

414
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,100
我这么问
I mean, I only ask because

415
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,060
是因为父亲一般不会单独带孩子来医院
it's a little unusual for the father to be here alone.

416
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,990
她只是需要好好休息一下
She just needed a little break, you know?

417
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:33,310
她...  她有点不在状态
She's... she's... she's not totally herself.

418
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,460
她有点...
I mean, she's a...

419
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,390
有点茫然  我猜吧
little dazed,I guess?

420
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,260
她跟宝宝们不亲近
She's not bonding with the babies.

421
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,020
尤其是凯尔  她跟凯尔不亲
And not with Kyle, mainly. You know? Not with Kyle.

422
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,860
她可能是有些崩溃了
I think she might be a little broken.

423
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,270
宝宝们好像让我妻子崩溃了
You know, I-I think the babies might have broken my wife.

424
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,980
你能治好她吧
You can fix her, right?

425
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,450
或者告诉我怎么治好她  我还指望...
Or you can tell me how to fix her? I was... I was hoping

426
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,790
-你能告诉我怎么治好她  -坐下  杰克
- you could tell me how to fix her. - Sit down, Jack.

427
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,050
她失去了一个孩子  杰克
She lost a baby, Jack.

428
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,140
你不能忽略这件事
You can't just dismiss that.

429
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,340
-我也一样  -对
- So did I. ?- Yeah.

430
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,700
可你化悲伤为行动了
And you took your grief, and you... channeled it into action.

431
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,400
以积极的态度跨过了那道坎
You willed yourself forward with positivity,

432
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,320
但丽贝卡...
but Rebecca has just...

433
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,250
她必须以自己的方式度过这关
She's gonna have to do this in her own way,

434
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,780
而你只能要给她足够的空间
and you're just gonna have to give her the space to do it.

435
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,730
如果她找不到办法呢
Yeah. What if she doesn't find her way?

436
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,260
-她会找到的  -你怎么知道
- She will. - ?How do you know?

437
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,960
正如同我知道
For the same reason that I know

438
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,150
你会给她足够的空间
you're gonna give her the space to find it.

439
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,490
因为我相信你们都是善良之人
'Cause I believe in good people.

440
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,860
{\an8}美国总统  出现"水门事件"丑闻

441
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,860
当然  我还支持过尼克松Of course, I voted for Nixon,

442
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,020
所以我说的话  你最好别全信
so you got to take everything I say with a grain of salt.

443
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,470
我办公室里有个沙发
Now, look, there's a couch in there in my office.

444
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,050
不如你去那躺躺睡个觉
Why don't you go lie down, take a nap?

445
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,390
我今天一整天都很闲
I'm-I'm totally free the rest of the day.

446
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,840
正好可以陪陪这些小家伙
I can use the time with my namesakes.

447
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,950
不了  他们三个呢  你不会...
No, there's three. You don't... you don't...

448
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,780
我亲手把他们带到这世上  杰克
I brought them into the world, Jack.

449
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,900
我绝对有资格花几小时坐在这里
I am perfectly qualified to sit here and watch 'em sleep

450
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,170
看他们睡觉和拉屎
and crap themselves for a couple of hours.

451
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,550
去睡吧  走吧
Now go. Now.

452
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,250
你好  抱歉打扰了  我在找人
Hi. Sorry to bother you. I'm looking for someone.

453
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,510
他是美国黑人  非常消瘦
he's Afro-American, very, very thin.

454
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,900
可能是个瘾君子
Possibly on drugs.

455
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,830
还是算了  我太可笑
You know what? I sound ridiculous.

456
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,310
对不起  我真是傻透了
Sorry. I sound so stupid.

457
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,850
你是指莎士比亚  你在找他吗
You mean Shakespeare? You looking for him?

458
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,490

大家都认识"多莉姑姑"  对吧
Everybody knows Aunt Dolly, right?

463
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,580
跟大家招招手  多莉  你好啊  多莉
Wave for everybody, Dolly. Hello, Dolly!

464
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,180
小心点啊  男士们  她对付男人很有一套
Be careful, gentlemen. She's a real man-eater.

465
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,490
是不是啊  多莉
Aren't you, Dolly?

466

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,780
她在摔东西  我被锁在壁橱里了
She's trashing the joint. I'm locked in the closet.

515
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,430
疯女人伊莱恩吗  她怎么会在那儿
Insane Elaine? Why is she there?

516
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,710
我打电话给她的
I called her.

517
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,430
怎么会
How?

518
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,490
我把她的电话号从你手机上删了
I deleted her number from your contacts.

519
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,060
我从云备份里找到的
I found it in the Cloud.

520
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,880
你联系了疯女人伊莱恩
You called Insane Elaine?

521
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,270
我还和她上了床
And I had sex with her.

522
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,940
我告诉她我要搬去纽约
And I told her I was moving to New York,

523
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,290
-然后她就发疯了  -我没疯
- and then she went crazy. - I am not crazy!

524
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,160
为什么所有人都说我是疯子  为什么
Why does everyone call me crazy?! Why?!

525
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,850
搬家的事让我有些不知所措了
You know what? Um, I got a little overwhelmed with the move,

526
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,920
我一直在给你打电话  可你没接
you know, I tried calling you, but you're not picking up.

527
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,510
天
Oh, God.

528
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,750
她又在摔东西了  快过来
You know what? She's breaking things again. Get over here.

529
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,770
我马上过来
I will be right over.

530
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,170
我...
I am...

531
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,230
对不起  我得走了
I'm sorry. I have to go.

532
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,860
你其实没必要过去
Oh, but really, you don't,

533
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,070
你觉得你必须过去  这样想挺疯狂的
and it's kind of crazy that you think that you do.

534
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,890
托比  你不懂
Toby, you don't get it.

535
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,500
我们是双胞胎  跟常人不一样
We're-we're twins. We're not like regular people.

536
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,020
我小时候摔断胳膊
When I was a kid, broke my arm

537
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,950
他在十英里之外的地方疼哭了  懂吗
and he cried out in pain ten miles away, right?

538
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,840
我们就是那么紧密相连
We're that connected.

539
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:37,000
问题是我以为我们也是如此
I thought we were, too, is the thing.

540
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:41,120
凯特  我又不是疯子
Kate, I'm not some nut job who performs grand gestures

541
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,810
随便为一个约过几次会的女生弄这么大排场
for every girl that I go on a few dates with.

542
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,820
我喜欢你  凯特  我很喜欢你
I like you, Kate. I like you a lot.

543
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,340
但我做不到跟在你哥后面做男二号
But I can't... I can't play second banana to your brother.

544
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,050
你只能这样
You have to.

545
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,740
所有人都得这样
Everyone has to.

546
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,670
好吧
Great.

547
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,520
在纽约玩得开心
Have a good time in New York!

548
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,370
威廉  能来这边谈谈吗
William, will you join me out here?

549
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,390
威廉

550
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,520
兰德尔  我也希望能带来好消息
Randall. I wish I had better news.

551
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,790
癌细胞转移了
The cancer has metastasized

552
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,500
现在的情况  我们也爱莫能助了
to a point where there's really not much we can do.

553
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,210
现在有一些实验治疗方案
There are some experimental treatments.

554
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,350
说实话  效果还没有太大保障
Frankly, they haven't been very promising.

555
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,950
我状况不太好  你应该看得出来
I'm not very well, as you can probably tell.

556
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,880
孩子不是这些东西的产物
The baby didn't come from this.

557
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,200
是爱情的结晶
It came from love.

558
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,510
他妈妈
His mother?

559
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,240
我们是在那辆巴士上相遇的
You know, we-we... we met on that bus, actually.

560
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,800
我的世界都围绕着那一天旋转
My world spun on every axis that day.

561
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,700
第一次聊天时  我为她读了诗
I read poetry to her the first time we talked.

562
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,200
不是我写的
Uh, not any of mine.

563
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,660
我太害羞了
I was too shy for that.

564
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,570
是我最喜欢的诗人之一
One of my favorite poets, and...

565
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,370
她那时非常喜欢我读诗给她听
She used to love it when I read to her.

566
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,100
你们给孩子取了什么名字
So what'd you name the baby?

567
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,800
凯尔
Kyle.

568
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,320
我怀了三胞胎
I was having triplets, and, um,

569
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,040
我们就是一时兴起取了名字
on a whim, actually, we just decided to name them.

570
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,780
凯文  凯特和凯尔
Kevin, Kate and Kyle.

571
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,810
分娩过程中  我失去了一个孩子
I... I lost one of the babies during delivery,

572
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,870
但你的孩子
but your baby showed up

573
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,860
正好是那天早上出现在了医院
at the hospital the very same morning.

574
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,790
就像命中注定一样
It felt like destiny.

575
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,110
我...
Um... I just...

576
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,340
能见到你  我很感激
I appreciate this. I-I, um...

577
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,330
我之前很想知道他的经历
I wanted to know his story.

578
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,690
这些就够了  所以...
And that there was good here, so...

579
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,350
我能时不时去看看他吗
I wonder if I could check on him from time to time.

580
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,850
不  不行
No. No.

581
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,310
我还需要确定
I-I also need to know...

582
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,870
我需要确定你不会来找他
I need to know that you're not gonna come back for him.

583
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,870
我需要确定我能松下这口气了
I need to know that I can move forward.

584
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,330
因为他流着你的血
Because he will have your blood

585
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,690
睡在你给他包上的毯子里  但到此为止了
and the blanket you wrapped him up in, but that's it.

586
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,880
就仅此而已了  不然我...
That's the deal. Otherwise, I...

587
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,950
我了解
I understand.

588
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,380
好
Okay.

589
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,810
我和...
I'm not...

590
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,390
我和那个孩子不太亲
I'm not bonding with the baby.

591
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:14,310
我想爱他  对他视如己出
I want to love him like he's my own,

592
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,680
但每当我看着他的脸...
but every time I look at his face...

593
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,410
取一个属于他的名字
Give him his own name.

594
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:38,070
你给她读的诗  那个作者叫什么
What was the name of the poet you used to read to her?

595
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,340
你最喜欢的诗人
Your favorite poet.

596
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,580
{\an8}达德利・兰德尔 著

597
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,830
哪天你觉得合适了  就交给他吧
Maybe you'll see fit to give it to him someday.

598
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,110
谢谢你
Thank you.

599
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,380
进展如何
How'd it go?

600
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,970
不好
It's bad.

601
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,120
医生也束手无策  真的
Nothing to be done, really.

602
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,240
给了几个实验治疗方案
Some experimental treatments

603
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,010
可以让他再多活几个月
that'll give him a few more months.

604
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,360
他正在楼上休息
He's upstairs resting.

605
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,580
平静地将双手交叉放在胸前
Peacefully with his arms crossed over his chest, no doubt.

606
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,810
我怀疑自己是不是他亲生的
I have no idea how I came from that man.

607
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,250
我很遗憾  亲爱的
I'm so sorry, babe.

608
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,000
我也不知道自己在期待什么
Yeah, I don't know what I expected.

609
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,570
不  我知道
Yes, I do.

610
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,960
我希望我找到的父亲没有身患重病
I expected to find a father who wasn't so damn sick.

611
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,470
-兰德尔  -我该早点去找他  贝丝
- Randall... - I should have looked for him years ago, Beth.

612
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,710
这样孩子们就可以和爷爷多相处几年
I mean, the girls could have had a grandfather all this time.

613
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,570
可我现在把他接回家是为了什么
Instead, I brought him here so they could what?

614
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,390
让孩子们喜欢上一个垂死的人吗
Fall in love with a dying man.

615
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,400
所以你只是担心孩子们吗
So, this is about the girls, then?

616
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,920
你不希望她们喜欢上他
You don't want them to fall in love with him?

617
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,350
他到这里都一周了  宝贝
He's been here a week, baby.

618
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,700
你对他的了解
And you don't know any more about him

619
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,970
也并没有随着这段时间的相处而加深
than you did the first time he walked through that door.

620
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,480
我不知道你做这些事是为了什么
I don't know what you were looking for with all this,

621
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,010
即使你自己知道
or even if you do,

622
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:34,070
我也只想说  你的时间和精力是有限的
but I do know you don't have a whole lot of time.

623
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,020
-她走了吗  -走了
- Is she gone? - ?Yeah.

624
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,160
我希望你这个炮约得值
God, I hope the booty call was worth it.

625
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,270
值
It was.

626
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,150
我突然变得有些不知所措
I just started to get overwhelmed, you know?

627
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,080
我读了一本你给我的剧本
Started reading one of those plays you gave me.

628
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,550
你才读了一本
You actually read one?

629
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,410
事实上我全读了
I read them all, actually.

630
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:28,240
但是这一本  特别出色
But, uh, this one, though, it's really good, you know?

631
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,600
真的很出色
Like, really good.

632
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,420
于是我有点不知所措
And I just started to get a little overwhelmed

633
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,810
因为我怕
'cause I felt like, um,

634
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,370
我怕自己配不上这么好的剧
I felt like maybe it was too good for me.

635
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,420
没有  凯文
It's not, Kevin.

636
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,350
真的  你能出演是他们的福气
It's not-- they would be lucky.

637
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,430
好吧...
Well...

638
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:50,890
我发现我交往的对象比伊莱恩还疯狂
So my guy turned out to be more insane than Elaine.

639
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,160
-托比  -听我说
- Toby? - ?Get this.

640
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,710
他把我带去一家养老院...
So he takes me to a nursing home...

641
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,530
让我在一群老人前唱歌
to sing in front of old people.

642
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,880
好让我在避免尴尬的情况下当一回明星
So I'd be a star but in a comfortable environment,

643
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,360
要不然我肯定会崩溃
'cause otherwise I would freak out.

644
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,990
一切都很完美
It was the whole works.

645
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,410
他准备了红毯  豪车还有礼服
He had the red carpet, he had the car, suit.

646
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,640
-那一切...  -很棒啊
- It was like... - Oh, that's good.

647
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,070
是的  在那之后
Yeah. And then afterwards,

648
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,770
我十分兴奋
like, I was on a high, like,

649
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,170
虽然这听起来很傻  但我感觉很自由
I know it sounds stupid, but I, I felt so free.

650
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,040
然后呢
Then what happened?

651
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,390
你打来了电话
Well, you called.

652
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,510
我说我要走  弄得他气急败坏
Told him I had to go and he got pouty and mean.

653
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,940
等一下  我竟然在那种关键时刻来电
Wait a minute, I called at that very moment

654
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,130
而你竟然还接了
and you actually answered the phone?

655
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,260
我当然接啊
Of course I answered.

656
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,640
反正我得专注到自己的减肥事业
Anyway, I need to focus on losing weight

657
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,360
还有我们的纽约梦上
and our big move to New York,

658
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,170
我根本不需要谈恋爱
and I don't even need to be in a relationship.

659
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:42,790
你被炒了
You're fired.

660
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,300
什么
What?

661
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,210
没错  凯特  你被解雇了
Yeah, Kate, you're fired.

662
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,010
为什么啊
Why?

663
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,140
你是你哥的私人助理
You're the personal assistant to your brother, all right?

664
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,530
一个把自己关在主卧壁橱里的哥哥
A brother who locks himself in his master bedroom closet.

665
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,480
这个壁橱又恰好
A master bedroom closet

666
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,130
附带着一个小酒吧
that happens to have a mini-bar in it.

667
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:07,630
也许我们该各自奋斗自己的事业了
Maybe it's time we go at it alone for a while, you know?

668
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,590
就一段时间  看结果如何
Just for a little while to see what happens.

669
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,710
也许我们该成熟一点
You know, maybe we need to grow up a bit.

670
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,810
不做你妹妹  我都不知道自己是谁
I don't really know who I am if I'm not your sister.

671
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,590
我知道
I do.

672
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:33,670
你肯定会喜欢她的
You're gonna love her.

673
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,160
我不喜欢你装暖男
I don't like it when you're sweet.

674
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,850
我来了  什么事
Okay, I'm here. What?

675
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,030
对不起
I'm sorry.

676
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,840
好吧  但是道歉不能改变...
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't change the fact...

677
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,670
从来没有人像你今天这样
What you did for me today was the nicest thing

678
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,870
为我这么用心过
that anyone has ever done for me.

679
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:08,720
好吧  但还是...
Okay, but that still doesn't...

680
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,820
我不打算搬到纽约了
And I'm not moving to New York.

681
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,820
-但还是改变不了...-我为你准备了这个
- Okay, but that still doesn't change... - I got you something.

682
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,660
我接受你的道歉
I accept your apology.

683
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,210
-是吗  -是的
- Yeah? - ?Yes.

684
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,730
不准接电话
Don't you dare answer that.

685
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,090
我不接
I'm not.

686
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,890
-别接  -我不接
- Do not. - ?I won't.

687
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,160
留言给凯特吧
Leave a message for Kate.

688
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,570
凯特  很好  你没接电话
Oh, Kate, good. You didn't answer.

689
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,960
希望这表示你正"性"福着呢
Hopefully, that means you're having sex.

690
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,320
话说  我买票了
Anyway, I did it.

691
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,880
我订了去纽约的夜间航班
I-I booked a red-eye to New York.

692
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,780
我打算去了  因为...
I'm just gonna do it, 'cause, you know...

693
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,350
凯特  如果我们继续谈下去
Kate, if we keep talking about it,

694
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,440
就会劝自己别这么做
we'll talk ourselves out of it.

695
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,350
我不会去
I'll never go.

696
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,590
你不会留下  所以...
You'll never stay, so...

697
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,890
我不打算跟你道别
And I'm not gonna say good-bye

698
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,670
整多愁善感那一套
or anything sappy like that.

699
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,000
你懂我的感觉
You know how I feel.

700
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,000
就这样吧
Okay.

701
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,920
我不知道你这四个小时去哪里了
You know, I didn't know where you were the last four hours.

702
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,100
我知道
I know.

703
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,580
对不起
I'm sorry.

704
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,810
我以为你跑到墨西哥城
I thought you ran off to Mexico

705
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,010
不要孩子们了
and abandoned the kids.

706
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,030
我永远不会跑到墨西哥城
I would never run off to Mexico

707
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,080
丢下你和孩子们
and abandon the kids without you.

708
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,990
你保证
Promise?

709
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,100
我保证
I promise.

710
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,080
我忍不住去想我们失去的那个孩子  杰克
I can't stop thinking about the one we lost, Jack.

711
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,290
我一直想  我知道
I can't. I know...

712
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,020
我知道有了这些新生儿  我该开心才对
I know we have these new babies, and I should be happy,

713
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,540
但我就是忍不住去想他
but I just can't stop thinking about him.

714
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:00,710
我也是
Me, too.

715
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,790
-是吗  -是
- Yeah? ?- Yeah.

716
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,940
我满脑子都是这事
That's all I think about.

717
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,380
我感觉
I feel... ?

718
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,910
我想到他时  感觉很内疚
I feel guilty when I think about him,

719
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,490
然后  不想他时
and then, you know, I-I feel guilty

720
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:15,310
也感觉很内疚
when I stop thinking about him.

721
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,420
我也是
Me, too.

722
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,180
我以为只有我这样想
I thought it was just me.

723
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,940
不  我也这样想
No. It's me, too.

724
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,310
我爱你
I love you.

725
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,310
我也爱你
I love you, too.

726
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,100
我们得给他起个新名字
I think we need to give him a new name.

727
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,350
我觉得这很重要
I think it's important.

728
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,010
你怎么会这么想
Where'd you get that idea?

729
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,000
就是这么感觉的
I just thought of it.

730
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,390
进来
Come in.

731
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,000
很抱歉今天不如想象中顺利
I'm sorry today didn't go as we hoped.

732
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,820
但我不会就此放弃
I'm not done yet, though.

733
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,630
纽约不只有一个厉害的肿瘤专家
There's more than one big-shot oncologist in New York.

734
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,220
好
Okay.

735
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,950
我想跟孩子们说出你的身份
I'd like to tell the girls who you are.

736

我想明天一早就说
I was thinking maybe first thing tomorrow.

737
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,120
她们会有很多疑问
They'll have a lot of questions.

738
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,660
我一定知无不言
Whatever they want to know.

739
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:53,910
好
Okay.

740
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,060
你跟我妈怎么认识的
How'd you meet my mother?

你都想不到  在巴士上认识的

我告诉你...
