1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:03,230
你被炒了
You're fired.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,010
《我們的生活》前情提要
Previously on This Is Us...

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,990
-什麼  -也許我們該奮鬥各自的事業了
- What? - I think it's time we go at it alone for a while.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,440
就一段時間  看結果如何
You know? See what happens.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,700
抱歉  我的劇本上沒寫有停頓...
This doesn't say "Pause" on my script.

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,310
上面也沒寫爛呢  再看現在這個效果
Well, it doesn't say "suck" either, yet here we are.

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,910
我根本不是演戲劇的料
I'm not cut out for theater.

8
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,540
你總是這樣  懷疑自己
You do that a lot-- doubt yourself.

9
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,580
你們一直忙著不讓凱特吃得太多
You're so busy making sure that Kate's not eating too much...

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,220
凱文  冷靜一下
Kev, calm down.

11
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,420
總怕蘭德爾覺得自己是被領養的
...and Randall's not too adopted!

12
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,450
對不起  我本該在你身邊的  以後改正
I'm sorry. I should have been there, and I'm gonna be there.

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,120
我兒子平時放學後
Do you think that my son could play with

14
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,110
-能跟你家小孩一起玩嗎  -當然
- yours sometime after school? - Yeah.

15
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,370
每次我新認識一個黑人
Every time I met a new black person,

16
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,920
就在那個小本本上標記一下
I would put a mark in this notebook,

17
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,830
每次遇見一個黑人男子
and every time I met a black man,

18
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,960
我就會想他會不會是我親生父親
I wondered if that man could possibly be my father.

19
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,400
不行  寶貝  要先吃完香蕉
No, baby, you got to finish your bananas first.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,940
想吃香蕉嗎  小凱  吃香蕉嗎
You want some banana? Kev, you want a little banana, too?

21
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,770
吃完就可以去找爸爸玩了  再吃點
Go in and see your daddy right now, okay? You have some more.

22
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,260
-傑克  牛奶好像沒了  -好
- Jack, I think we're completely out of milk. - Yeah.

23
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,550
-他就是不喝果汁  -行  我...
- He won't drink his juice. - Yeah, I'll, um...

24
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,100
-就想喝牛奶  -我下次帶點回來
- He just wants milk. - I'll bring some home.

25
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,820
要再吃點蘋果嗎  來吧
Do you want some more apples? Come on.

26
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,080
來  吃飽了要不要下來  好的
Come on. Here, do you want to get out of your chair? Yeah.

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,070
來吧
All right. Come on.

28
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,210
親愛的  你要去做文職
Babe, a desk job?

29
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,450
小貝  我們需要這份工資
Bec, we need the money.

30
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,120
你連領帶都沒有
You don't even own a tie.

31
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,390
{\an8}三個小傢伙之家

32
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,960
話說
So...

33
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,800
你聽說了嗎
did you hear?

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,730
聽說了
Uh... yeah.

35
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,090
要在茶水間給桑德拉準備驚喜生日蛋糕
Surprise birthday cake for Sandra in the break room.

36
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,880
其實根本算不上什麼驚喜
You know, it's never, it's never a surprise.

37
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,050
還有一件事
Okay, also,

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,850
我升職了
I got promoted.

39
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,330
現在是項目經理了
Project manager.

40
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,540
-太好了  恭喜你  -謝謝
- That's great, man. Hey. - Thanks.

41
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,850
我想帶你一起
And I'm bringing you with me.

42
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,160
這個...
Oh. Um...

43
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,450
謝謝你  不過算了
thanks, but no.

44
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,340
-還是謝謝你  -怎麼算了
- But thanks. - No?

45
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,510
你先別聲張
Keep this quiet,

46
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,870
我準備自己出去闖
but I'm, uh, gonna go out on my own.

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,670
想自己創業
I want to start my own thing.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,860
我知道很冒險  但是只要事業步入正軌
I know it's risky, but once I get things up and running,

49
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,710
我就能有更多時間陪孩子們了
I can spend more time with my kids.

50
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,380
好吧  要不這樣  先別急著拒絕
All right, how 'bout this: why don't you, um,

51
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,810
花幾天時間考慮一下
take till the end of the week,

52
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,520
-週末再答覆我  -真的不用了
- think about it. - I'm okay.

53
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,110
我不需要考慮
Don't need to think.

54
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,850
週末再說  好嗎
End of the week, okay?

55
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,650
{\an9}成績單

56
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,530
-爸爸回來了  -回來了
- Daddy's home! - Hi!

57
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,100
爸爸  爸爸
Dad! Dad!

58
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,050
-爸爸  -小凱別鬧
- Dad! - Kev.

59
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,090
-爸爸  -小凱
- Dad! - Kev.

60
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,750
-小子  -我有問題要問你  
- Hi. Hey, buddy. - I need to ask you a question...

61
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,570
-稍等  -爸爸
- One second. - Dad!

62
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,830
-你快看  -已經做得這麼漂亮啦
- Watch this. - Hey, look-look at the progress you made, bud.

64
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,550
-爸爸  -怎麼了
- Dad! - Yeah.

65
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,110
-我們有冰淇淋吃啦  -冰淇淋
- We're getting ice cream! - Ice cream!

66
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,410
-冰淇淋  -我答應他們的
- Ice cream? - I promised them.

67
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,260
冰淇淋  冰淇淋
Ice cream? Ice cream?!

68
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,530
又不是給我買的  不然你下次就抱不動我了
None for me if you want to be able to pick me up again.

69
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,740
瞎說  你這麼瘦
Please, you are tiny.

70
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,810
-就你嘴甜  -不過你答應買冰淇淋
- Right. Mm. - But ice cream must mean that the kids'

71
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,310
-是不是因為孩子們成績挺好  -沒有
- report cards came back and they were good? - No.

72
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,390
基本都是B和C  我沒轍了
Actually, mostly B's and C's. I caved.

73
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,360
不知道該怎麼辦  我額葉都疼了
I don't know. Parenting makes my cerebellum hurt.

74
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,450
你的什麼
Sorry, your what?

75
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,490
就是我的大腦中控制情緒的部分
It's the part of my brain that makes my emotions.

76
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,460
我做了太多三年級的科學作業了
I have been doing way too much third grade science homework.

77
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,820
不過你還是看看這個吧
But why don't you, uh, look at that.

78
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,310
蘭德爾的老師為什麼想見我們
Why does Randall's teacher want to see us?

79
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,390
不知道
I don't know.

80
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,680
好吧
Okay.

81
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,310
*你如此美麗*
*You are too beautiful*

82
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,860
*親愛的  我想對你說*
*My dear, to be true*

83
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,830
*我如此愚鈍*
*For one lucky fool*

84
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,890
*配不上你*
*To be with*

85
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,200
*你太過美麗*
*You are too beautiful*

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,410
*我如此愚鈍*
*And I am a fool*

87
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,900
*卻愛慕著你*
*For beauty*

88
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,870
恕我冒昧  如果太久不彈  鋼琴會很孤單
Hope you don't mind. Pianos get forlorn if you don't play 'em.

89
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,720
不  我完全不介意
No, of course I don't mind.

90
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,840
-你怎麼學會彈鋼琴的  -我爸教我的
- Where'd you learn how to play like that? - My dad taught me.

91
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,110
我爸是他爸教的
And his dad taught him.

92
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,060
爸爸  你能教我們彈琴嗎
Dad, can you teach us to play?

93
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,080
我也很想教
I wish I could.

94
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,060
可家堛滬絳眵茩M都被奶奶和凱特姑姑佔了
Grandma and Aunt Kate got all the music talent in the family.

95
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,980
我一向都只有肌肉發達
Me? I was always all knuckles.

96
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,380
你爸比較擅長其他方面
Yeah, well, your dad's got other skills.

97
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
以前我還能靠這個本事
Me, I managed to squeak out a couple of dollars

98
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,990
混幾口飯吃
on one of these back in the day.

99
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,940
主要是吹小號  什麼表演我都參加
Mostly trumpet, mm. Any gigs I could get.

100
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,350
你能不能來參加學校的職業日
Will you speak at my career day?

101
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,130
職業日能不能叫爺爺去
Can Grandpa speak at my career day?

102
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,680
我想不行  寶貝兒
I don't think so, baby.

103
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,840
只能一個人發言  我已經報名了
You're only allowed one speaker, and I'm already signed up.

104
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,070
我想讓爺爺講
I pick Grandpa.

105
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,560
他的工作很酷
He had a cool job.

106
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,790
你是說老爸的工作就不酷了嗎
What are you saying, that Daddy doesn't have a cool job?

107
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,840
你們很喜歡到辦公室找我玩  不是嗎
But you guys love visiting me at the office, right?

108
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,250
我喜歡坐在你的椅子上轉圈
I like spinning in your chair.

109
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,380
其實你的工作有點無聊  爸爸
You kind of have a boring job, Dad.

110
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,150
基於長期氣候模式的商品期貨交易
Trading commodity futures based on long-term weather patterns

111
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,700
才不會無聊  好嗎
is not boring, okay?

112
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,670
抱歉
Sorry,

113
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,040
一聽"商品"這個詞我就有點犯困
sort of fell asleep soon as I heard the word "commodity."

114
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,340
凱文叔叔  你能在我的職業日上發言嗎
Uncle Kevin, can you speak at my career day?

115
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,960
老爸會負責職業日  討論到此結束
Daddy's doing career day! End of discussion.

116
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,220
我的發言會很"燃"的
And it's gonna be lit.

117
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,700
"燃"這個字不是這麼用的  對吧
That's not how you use "lit," right?

118
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,120
對
No.

119
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,730
對不起  我不明白
Sorry, I don't understand.

120
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,630
你們是說蘭德爾很有天分嗎
So you are saying that Randall is gifted?

121
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,880
可他成績很一般啊
But his grades are average.

122
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,690
你確定給他做的測試沒問題嗎
Are you sure you tested him right?

123
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,190
傑克  我們知道他有多聰明
Jack, we know how smart he is.

124
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,790
那他的成績是怎麼回事
Okay, so what's up with his grades?

125
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,550
也許是...  老師對他有偏見
M-Maybe is the-the teacher prejudiced?

126
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,700
-傑克  -不可能
- Jack. - No.

127
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,860
如果孩子在測試中表現良好
When a child tests well

128
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,120
成績卻反映不出來
but his grades don't seem to reflect it,

129
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,920
通常是他所在的學校沒有足夠的挑戰
oftentimes, he isn't being challenged at his school.

130
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,920
或許你們可以考慮其他選擇
And you maybe want to consider other options.

131
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,710
{\an8}海恩斯學院
招收超常兒童

132
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,710
他們對蘭德爾這類特殊兒童
They have wonderful programs

133
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,040
由一套出色的學習方案
for exceptional children like Randall.

134
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:06,940
絕對不行
Not gonna happen.

135
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,620
傑克  你能不能冷靜點
Jack, please stop making me say "Jack."

雖然蘭德爾在的這所學校只有幾個黑人孩子
Randall is one of the only black kids at this school,

137
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,530
可他在這兒至少還有兄弟姐妹
but at least here he has his brother and sister.

138
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,740
-我明白  -那另外兩個孩子呢
- I know. - What about them?

139
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,280
他們也能去那所學校嗎
I mean, can they go, too?

140
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,870
皮爾森先生  恕我冒昧
Mr. Pearson, all due respect,

141
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,790
凱文和凱特過去是沒什麼好處的
Kevin and Kate wouldn't do well in that school.

142
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,720
看到沒  這就是你們犯的錯誤
You see, that's where you're wrong.

143
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,470
我們的三個孩子都很出眾
All of our children are exceptional.

144
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,850
我能摸摸你嗎
Can I touch you?

145
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,810
我只想再觸摸你一次
I just want to touch you one more time.

146
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,650
哪怕...  只是你身體的一部分
Just... one part of your body.

147
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,590
你的頭髮
Your hair.

148
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,100
我想清醒過來
I want to wake up...

149
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,140
對不起  我...  我...
I'm sorry, I... I'm...

150
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,800
我不能...

151
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,680
對不起  可以重來一遍嗎
I'm sorry, can we... can we just start over?

152
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,030
好的  凱文  能問你個問題嗎
Yeah, yeah. Uh, Kevin, can I ask you something?

153
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,070
當然
Yeah.

154
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,050
為什麼...
Why...

155
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,330
你能不能試著給我解釋一下
Just try to help me understand this.

156
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,130
為什麼每到這個場景
Wh-Why, every time we come to this scene,

157
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,890
這場戲悲傷到極點  本應該...
this-this pinnacle of grief, which should rip...

158
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,280
我是說  你本該讓觀眾們痛哭流涕
I mean, literally rip... tears from the audience,

159
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,660
你語氣怎麼像谷歌地圖的語音一樣毫無感情呢
why you summon up all the emotion of a Google Maps voice.

160
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,290
好吧
Right.

161
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,570
我不知道  可能...
I don't know. May...

162
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,760
可能台詞有問題
You know, maybe it's in the words.

163
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,390
你怎麼知道
How would you know?

164
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,530
你從沒說過那段詞
You've never said them.

165
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,500
沒有啊  我...  我正說著呢
Uh, no, I think... I think I'm saying 'em.

166
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,660
不對  你是  說了幾句
No. I mean, yeah, like, s-some.

167
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,080
說了點
Kind of.

168
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,360
可你大多都改了
But you're-you're mostly paraphrasing.

169
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,540
-對不起  -沒事沒事
- I'm sorry. - Y-Yeah.

170
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,200
你看  其實很簡單
You see, it's really simple.

171
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,440
奧利維亞就是傑西卡  你的妻子
Olivia is Jessica, your wife.

172
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
-又來了  -你就是大衛
- Okay. - You are David.

173
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,270
你愛她
You loved her,

174
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,840
可現在她死了
but now she is dead.

175
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,960
所以你正為失去她而悲痛不已
So you are grieving the loss of her.

176
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,350
你的世界都崩塌了
There's no longer any such thing as gravity.

177
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,590
你有沒有失去過什麼人
Have you ever lost anyone?

178
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,740
有
Yes.

179
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,330
可我不相信你
Because I don't believe you.

180
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,800
知道嗎  羅恩  我的工作
Well, you know, Ron, it's not my job

181
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,030
不是要讓你來相信我
to make sure you believe me.

182
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,900
不  不對  就是這樣
Oh, yes, yes, it is! It is!

183
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,410
這就是你的事
It is exactly your job!

184
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,070
做好你該做的事
Do your job.

185
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,300
她在寫什麼
What is she writing?

186
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,190
你寫什麼呢
What are you writing?

187
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,290
寫她的絕命書
That's her suicide note.

188
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,710
好了  好了  你們都夠了  好嗎
All right, all right, enough, okay?

189

我打算花一整天時間
Oh. Uh, well, tomorrow I was just gonna spend

198
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,550
感受我的失敗  不過...
the entire day feeling like a failure, but, uh...

199
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,860

215
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,140
可能和這份工作不是很相符
might not be directly applicable.

216
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,030
可是我這人做事條理分明

他對你稱讚有加
He speaks about you in such glowing terms.

234

你為什麼要離開他的公司
Why did you quit his firm?

235
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,120
因為我愛上了他
Because I fell in love with him,

236
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,180
所以我們不適合一起工作

我喜歡你  凱特

262
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,870
就好比你舔一下披薩
It's like licking a piece of pizza

263
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,770
別人就不會吃了
so that nobody will eat it later.

264
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,080
我開始想披薩了
Now I'm thinking about pizza.

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,430
如果連我的老婆孩子都不理解我是做什麼的
Look, how am I supposed to inspire an auditorium full of strangers,

268
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,480
我又怎麼能打動一個禮堂的陌生人呢
and my own wife and kids don't even understand what I do?

269
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,930
-不是這樣的  -真的嗎
- That's not true. - Really?

270
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,330
我是做什麼的
What do I do?

271
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,440

272
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,360
你根據天氣類型交易商品
You trade commodities based on weather patterns.

273
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,560
這又是什麼意思呢
And what does that mean?

274
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,590
該死  蘭德爾  我不知道
Oh, damn, Randall, I don't know.

275
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,800
你用閃電球交換雷暴雲
You swap lightning bolts for thunder clouds?

276
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,930
我知道你每天都是怎麼度過的
Look, I know what your day is like.

277
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,970
我知道你喜歡其中一個合夥人
I know that you like one of your partners

278
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,530
卻討厭另外一個
and you hate the other one.

279
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,010
我知道你打算重新設計辦公室的傢俱
I know that you're gonna redesign your office furniture

280
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,800
你還有可能解雇你的助理
and that you might fire your assistant

281
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,010
因為她總是說"好像"  
because she says "like" too much.

282
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,100
她說個不停
It's nonstop.

283
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,730
我能和你深入地探討一下天氣類型嗎
Can I talk to you in depth about weather patterns?

284
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,090
不行  我做不到
No, I cannot.

285
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,730
即便我能  你也不會答應的  所以...
But I don't think you'd want me to if I could, so...

286
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,390
你到底怎麼了
Hey, what's-what's this really about?

287
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,540
或許我本該成為一位音樂家
Maybe I was meant to be a musician.

288
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,420
不好意思  你說什麼
I'm sorry, what now?

289
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,230
或者藝術家  或者作家
Or an artist or a writer.

290
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,620
想想看  貝絲
Just think about it, Beth.

291
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,100
也許我身上是有這種天賦的
There's this whole genetic side of me

292
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,790
只是根本沒人發現
that nobody even knew existed.

293
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,570
我是說  威廉是個詩人
I mean, William was a poet,

294
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,420
藝術家  音樂家
an artist, a musician.

295
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,020
也許我一直很有藝術天賦
You know, maybe I've had an artistic side in me all along

296
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,560
可沒人發掘出來
and nobody knew to empower it.

297
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,620
或許我不該做一個
You know, maybe I wasn't meant to be

298
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,380
每天必須西裝革履
a straight and narrow math geek

299
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,750
中規中矩跟數字打交道的呆子
destined to wear a shirt and tie every day

300
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,960
就像我父母想像的那樣
like my parents thought.

301
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,350
也許我這輩子就該做個音樂家
Maybe I was meant to live a musician's life.

302
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,230
到處奔走  在酒吧媞t奏
On the road and playing clubs, you know?

303
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,020
好吧  在你這個音樂家的夢中
All right, well, in this musical fantasy version of yourself,

304
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,870
-你演奏哪種...  -薩克斯
- what instrument would you... - Sax.

305
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,500
{\an8}1990年美國爵士樂電影

306
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,500
就像《愛情至上》中的韋斯利
Like Wesley in Mo' Better Blues.

307
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,390
一定得是薩克斯
Definitely sax.

308
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,140
是啊
Oh, yeah.

309
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,710
真是太性感了
That's sexy, yeah.

310
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,780
你在笑話我
You're making fun of me.

311
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,610
-沒有  -有  你就是在笑話我
- No. - No, you're making fun of me.

312
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,010
不  沒有  我沒有啦
No, I am not. I'm-I'm not.

313
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,100
你親生父親剛回到你的生活中
Your biological father just came back into your life,

314
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,650
這激起了你的很多想法
and it's bringing up all kinds of stuff.

315
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,130
這  這很正常
It's-it's normal.

316
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,260
聽著
Look,

317
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,440
你不妨試試展示下自己狂野藝術家的一面
why don't you try out this-this crazy artist side

318
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,250
在這次發言中一鳴驚人
of yourself and, you know, get this presentation popping.

319
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,990
看看八歲小觀眾們喜不喜歡  好嗎
Let's see how it flies with some eight-year-olds, right?

320
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,900
在你真的改行
Before you, like, shift careers

321
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,030
去夜場演奏薩克斯風之前先實踐下
and start playing open mic saxophone nights.

322
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,500
-也許我真會去  -那好啊
- You know, maybe I will. - Okay, yeah.

323
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,790
我知道你在笑話我  不過我會試試的
I see you are making fun of me, but I will.

324
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,990
沒有  好啊
No, yeah.

325
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,620
-你能不能不笑了  -我停不下來
- Why don't you stop smiling? - I can't.

326
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,190
-別笑了  -抱歉
- Stop smiling. - I'm sorry.

327
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,630
我忍不住  這中年危機早期癥狀太像你了
This early midlife crisis is so you, I can't stand it.

328
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,280
你想再來點笑料嗎
You want something to smile about?

329
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,970
-不要了  拜託  -真的  真的嗎
- No, please. - Do you, do you really?

330
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,570
你好  麻煩找下麥克爾
Hi, can I speak to Michael please?

331
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,880
唐納  我是凱特
Hey, Tanner, it's Kate.

332
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,980
對  凱文的妹妹  你最近怎麼樣
Yeah, Kevin's sister. How are you?

333
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,000
很好  想問下你會不會剛好有空
Oh, good. Are you by any chance

334
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,490
來參加個慈善會
available on the third for a charity event?

335
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,640
我有個問題想問下你
Hey, I have a question for you:

336
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,040
你對無家可歸現象怎麼看
how do you feel about homelessness?

337
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,490
我明白  很糟糕  對吧
I know, it's a bummer, right?

338
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,670
我們差不多要接待四百人
So, we're looking to cater about 400 people.

339
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,580
您的餐廳勢必也想加入到我們的活動
Your restaurant's definitely gonna want to be a part of this.

340
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,420
天啊  我知道
Oh, my-- I know.

341
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,860
太棒了  行  很好
Awesome, okay, great.

342
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,680
謝謝  澤  拜拜
Thanks, Z. Bye.

343
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,100
你太能幹了
You're killer.

344
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,280
我要你載我去艾希莉家
I need you to take me to Ashley's.

345
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,880
讓凱特載你去怎麼樣
Oh, well, what if Kate gave you a ride?

346
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,790
可以嗎
Do you mind?

347
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,070
行
No.

348
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,510
抱歉
Sorry.

349
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,360
我在車媯尼A  實習生

- Should we go in? - Yeah.

351
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,280
這到底是個什麼派對
Listen, what kind of party is this anyway?

352
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,830
大家看著都很難過的樣子
'Cause everyone seems pretty sad.

353
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,800
當然難過了
Of course they're sad.

354
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,380
這是場追悼會
It's a memorial service.

355
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,050
快點  我們進去吧
Come on, in we go,

356
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,640
不然好吃的奶酪要沒了
before all the good cheese is gone.

357
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,330
{\an8}海恩斯學院

358
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,700
我們來這兒幹嘛
What are we doing here?

359
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,410
我們來這
We are here

360
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,410
是因為你妻子  還記得她嗎
because your wife-- do you remember her?

361
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,660
應該記得
I think so, yeah.

362
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,760
你愛她勝於生命的那個人
The one that you love more than life itself?

363
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,190
-想起來了  -那就好
- Definitely rings a bell. - Got it.

364
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,710
她想看看這地方
She wants to take a look at this place.

365
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,250
好吧  我在看呢
Okay, I'm looking.

366
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,300
天啊  這地方比蘭德爾 
Geez, this place is whiter

367
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,120
之前那滿是白人的學校還要"白"啊
than Randall's already pretty white other school.

368
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,110
看看這些孩子
I mean, look at these kids.

369
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,730
他們就像小小的納粹機器人
They look like little nazi robots.

370
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,400
那小孩還拎了個公文包
That one's got a briefcase.

371
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,990
我說  哪有孩子拎公文包的啊
I... no kid should be carrying a briefcase.

372
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,950
我覺得很可愛啊
I think it's cute.

373
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,810
是  你現在是覺得可愛  往後他餘生
Yeah, it's cute now; next thing you know, he's gonna be

374
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,360
都要被困在辦公室的小格子堣F
trapped in a cubicle for the rest of his life.

375
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,720
我告訴你吧  先是拎個公文包
I tell you, it starts with a briefcase,

376
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,920
接著再繫上個領帶  坐上辦公桌
then you put on a tie, you sit at a desk.

377
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,940
接下來你猜怎樣  你就被束縛在日光燈下了
Next thing you know, you are so conditioned to the florescent lights

378
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,600
你走到外面  連太陽都會刺痛你的眼睛
that when you step outside, the sun actually burns your eyes.

379
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,930
真的嗎
Really?

380
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,070
我說的不是自己
This isn't about me.

381
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,350
肯定也不是說蘭德爾吧
Well, it certainly isn't about Randall.

382
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,920
我  我本來不打算在有初步規劃前
Look, I... I wasn't gonna say anything

383
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,850
把事情說出來的  不過...
until I'd had a few details worked out, but...

384
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,870
我打算自己出來混了
I think I'm gonna go out on my own.

385
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,430
自己開公司
Start my own company.

386
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,800
三個小傢伙之家  我只是...
Big Three Homes. I just...

387
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,810
現在說可能有點不合時宜
Doesn't feel like a very good time right now.

388
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,800
我覺得挺好的
I think it's great.

389
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,770
你應該去試試
I think you should do it.

390
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,690
沒那麼簡單的  小貝
It's not that easy, Bec.

391
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,490
這個地方得花多少錢
I mean... what does this place even cost?

392
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,370
我們會想到辦法的
We'll figure it out.

393
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,530
會有辦法的  我們可以讓蘭德爾換一所學校
We'll figure it out-- we'll send Randall to another school,

394
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,250
給他請個家教  盡我們所能
we'll get him a tutor, we'll do whatever we have to do.

395
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,940
好  我只希望你能快樂
All right. I just don't want you to be unhappy.

396
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,420
-我說真的  -明白
- I mean it. - Okay.

397
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,600
那就好
All right.

398
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,490
我們會再回來的
We'll come back.

399
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,080
這兒很漂亮
This is nice.

400
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,270
非常漂亮
It's very nice.

401
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,190
傑瑪  你媽媽說你會告訴我
Jemma, your mom told me that you would be giving me

402
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,370
艾希莉家的地址
Ashley's address.

403
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,170
傑瑪  你能不能回答我的問題
Jemma, will you answer me?

404
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,060
傑瑪  我需要地址
Jemma, I'm gonna need the address.

405
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,300
-幹嘛  你急著回去工作嗎  -是的
- Why? 'Cause you need to get back to work? - Yes.

406
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,620
要不是看重這份工作
And if I didn't value the work,

407
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,310
我也不會甘願忍受你這態度了
I wouldn't be tolerating this attitude.

408
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,680
只是澄清下
Just so we're clear.

409
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,320
她跟你說什麼了  讓你當合夥人嗎
What'd she tell you, you'd be an associate?

410
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,820
你真以為我媽媽會因為
And you thought my mom was gonna

411
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,920
一些三流明星接你的電話
give you actual responsibilities,

412
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,650
就給你真正的職位嗎
because a few C-list celebrities take your calls?

413
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,260
很顯然  她雇你
Clearly she only hired you

414
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,360
只是因為她覺得一個胖女孩會走進我的內心
because she thinks the fat girl can get through to me.

415
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,100
我猜她是覺得  越胖越好吧
Guess she figured, bigger the better.

416
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,760
其實我覺得你挺可憐的
You know, I actually feel bad for you.

417
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:41,820
搞什麼鬼
What the hell?

418
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,900
你別可憐我  好吧
Yeah, well, don't feel bad for me, okay?

419
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,390
因為我還有車回家
'Cause I have a ride home.

420
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,880
什麼意思
I'm sorry?

421
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,440
-下車  -什麼
- Get out. - What?

422
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,360
給我下車  傑瑪  不然我把你扔出去
Get out of the damn car, Jemma, before I toss you out of it!

423
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,650
你知道嗎  你可以走路去艾希莉家
And you know what? You can walk to Ashley's.

424
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,630
給你分享胖女孩的心得  如果你走得快
And fat girl to fat girl, if you keep up the pace,

425
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,110
走路一小時可以燃燒417卡路里
you can burn 417 calories an hour walking.

426
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,770
我太愛美式奶酪了
I love American cheese.

427
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,240
英式奶酪吃起來總是很沮喪  太煩了
English cheese is so blue, it's angry.

428
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,580
美式奶酪就好像是可以躺上去的床
American cheese is like a-a bed you can just fall into.

429
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,520
話說回來  這是誰的告別聚會
So, whose good-bye party is this anyway?

430
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,080
弗蘭克·彭德格拉斯
Frank Pendergrass.

431
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,570
三天前他在中央公園慢跑時
Tree branch fell on him three days ago

432
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,530
樹枝砸在了他身上
when he was jogging through Central Park.

433
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,310
就這麼死了
Bang. Dead.

434
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,510
這也太倒霉了
Well, that sucks.

435
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,090
你怎麼認識他的
You knew him how?

436
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,880
我不認識  訃告上寫了追悼會的地址
Oh, I didn't. No, the obituary gave the address of the service,

437
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,280
於是我就...
so, I thought...

438
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,400
等一下
Hold on a second.

439
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,300
你是什麼意思
What are you trying to say?

440
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,450
你好
Hello.

441
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,600
我是弗蘭克的妻子  格蕾絲
I'm Frank's wife, Grace.

442
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,580
你好  我叫傑西卡
Hi. Uh, I'm Jessica.

443
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,210
這是我丈夫  大衛
This is my husband, David.

444
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,810
你們是我丈夫的學生嗎
Were you students of my husband?

445
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,970
我們其實是在他的課上相識的
We actually met in his class.

446
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,630
是吧
Right?

447
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,060
他學生
Students.

448
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,430
當時我們坐在第一排
Yeah, we were sitting in the front row,

449
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,170
一直眉來眼去的
and we kept looking at each other,

450
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,350
最後弗蘭克看不下去了  停下來說道
and then finally Frank stopped the class and said,

451
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,150
"你們倆太讓我分心了  出去  上個床
"You two are distracting me. Go outside, have sex,

452
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,070
準備好學知識了再進來"
and come back when you're ready to learn something."

453
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,410
還真像弗蘭克會說的話
Well, that sounds like Frank.

454
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,910
弗蘭克
Frank.

455
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,110
謝謝你們的到來
Thank you both so much for coming.

456
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,450
-感謝你的到來  -節哀順變
- Thank you for coming. - I'm so sorry for your loss.

457
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,350
謝謝
Thank you.

458
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,910
任務完成了
Well done.

459
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,580
不不不  等等  你把我
No, no, no, hold on. No, no, no. You brought...

460
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,180
你把我帶到一個陌生人的葬禮上來
You brought me to a stranger's funeral?

461
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,470
-追悼會  -管它叫什麼  為什麼
- Memorial service. - Whatever. Why

462
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,670
因為我演不好苦情戲嗎
What, because I'm struggling with the grief scene?

463
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,790
你說過我會演好的
You said I would get there.

464
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,570
是啊  但我可沒說憑你自己能演好
Yeah, well, I didn't say you'd get there on your own.

465
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,770
這也太瘋狂了
This is insane.

466
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,880
但是十分感謝你的這一課
But thank you very much for the lesson.

467
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
我很感激  現在我要去喝杯酒
I appreciate it. Now I'm gonna go have a drink.

468
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,330
好好享受你的奶酪吧
Enjoy your cheese.

469
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,480
{\an8}華特迪士尼於1967年製作並發行的動畫電影

470
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,480
寶貝  怎麼不看《森林王子》了
Hey, baby, what happened to Jungle Book?

471
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,660
演完了
It's over.

472
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,680
媽咪悄悄來洗個澡  噓
Well, Mommy snuck in a quick shower-- shh.

473
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,610
一分一秒的時間都不能浪費呀  小可愛
Got to get them in while you can, little bug.

474
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,740
你真漂亮
You're so pretty.

475
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,720
謝謝  寶貝
Thank you, baby.

476
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,300
如果我漂亮你也漂亮  因為我們長得很像
Well, if I'm pretty, you're pretty, 'cause we look alike.

477
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,350
能不能把媽媽的黃色襯衣拿來
Oh, can you get Mommy's yellow blouse,

478
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,570
帶紐扣的那件
the one with the buttons?

479
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,060
就在衣櫥  謝謝
Just in the closet? Thank you.

480
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,570
{\an8}S號

481
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,110
{\an8}XL號

482
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,720
謝謝  寶貝
Thank you, bug.

483
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,600
我去接蘭德爾
Okay, I'm going to pick up Randall.

484
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,960
再見  小美人
Good-bye, beautiful.

485
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,930
一會兒見  寶貝  還有
Bye, see you later. Hey, baby,

486
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,320
我馬上就準備好了
I'm almost done getting ready.

487
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,750
今晚  小傢伙  我們一起拼B-52飛機
Tonight, little man, you, me and a B-52?

488
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,250
別做完了  我也要來拼一點
Okay, don't finish it, I got to help with something.

489
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,200
可以呀
Sounds good.

490
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,320
抱歉  我是在  我在...
I'm sorry. I was, I was, uh...

491
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,290
大家一直送我吃的  好像我不會做飯一樣
People keep bringing me things, like I forgot how to cook.

492
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,690
冰箱都放不下了
There's no room in here

493
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,980
我也不知道把弗蘭克的食物放哪兒
and I don't know where to put all of Frank's food.

494
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:10,980
好多醃黃瓜
You have a lot of pickles.

495
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,360
我討厭醃黃瓜
I hate pickles.

496
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,520
但是他超愛的
But he loves them.

497
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,480
他在床上吃
Yeah, he eats them in bed.

498
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,110
曾經
"Ate."

499
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,260
現在他是過去式了
He is now past tense.

500
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,060
以前可以直呼其名
He used to be "is."

501
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,620
現在都要加個曾經
Now he is "was."

502
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,580
我喜歡醃黃瓜
Hey, I like pickles.

503
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,650
那太好了
Good.

504
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,320
-給你  -好
- Here. - OK.

505
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,510
你喜歡節日領帶嗎
How do you feel about holiday ties?

506
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,920
還有運動外套
And sport coats.

507
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,760
因為我問過傑埵怳F
Because I asked Jeremy,

508
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,830
他說不需要任何他爸爸的遺物
but he said he didn't want anything of his dad's.

509
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,140
傑埵怞h大了
How old is Jeremy?

510
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,440
十五歲
Fifteen.

511
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,260
這太殘忍了
That's tough.

512
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,800
十五歲的話太殘忍了
15 is tough.

513
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,050
我小時候
Uh, my dad and I

514
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,040
我和我爸會一起拼模型  
used to build models together, when I was a kid.

515
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:18,930
是嗎
Yeah?

516
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,640
是的  我們會拼飛機  輪船
Yeah, we'd build, um, planes and boats.

517
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,530
我以前總是挑最難的拼
I used to pick the most complex ones,

518
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,040
B-52轟炸機  航空母艦
B-52s, aircraft carriers,

519
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,590
因為做這些花的時間最長
'cause they took the longest, you know?

520
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,480
我們家有三個孩子
See, I was one of three kids,

521
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,070
所以真得花心思去爭取和爸爸獨處的時間
so you really had to strategize to get your alone time with Dad.

522
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,790
最後
You know, and eventually,

523
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,690
我們建了一整只艦隊  
we had a whole fleet of them;

524
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,950
一排一排地在架子上陳列著
We had just rows and rows, shelves of them.

525
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,870
當他去世以後...
You know, and then when he died...

526
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,310
當...
when...

527
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,780
當他去世後  我...
when he... when he died, I, um...

528
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,440
我把這些模型都扔掉了
I-I threw all the models away.

529
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,430
我把每一個都扔掉了
I threw every one of them away.

530
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,820
我也不知道我為什麼要這樣做
I don't know why... why I did that, you know?

531
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,640
那時你多大
You were how old?

532
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,540
那是很久以前了
Uh, it was a long time ago.

533
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,720
我還留著...
I have, um...

534
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,850
我還留著這個
I have this.

535
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,880
這個項鏈  這是他的
This necklace, this is his and, um,

536
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,750
我就只留了他這條鏈子
it's the only thing I have left of him.

537
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,190
最開始  我並不想戴
And at first, you know, I didn't want to wear it,

538
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,350
我不會戴  甚至都不想看  但現在...
I wouldn't wear it, I wouldn't even look at it, but now it's...

539
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,260
我只有這了  我不能取下來  所以...
It's all I have and I... I can't take it off now, so...

540
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,730
沒事的
It's okay.

541
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,750
天哪  這實在太蠢了  
Oh, my God, this is so dumb.

542
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,360
我在做什麼  我該來安慰你才是
What am I doing? I'm supposed to be comforting you,

543
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,770
而不是把鼻涕流你身上到處都是
not snotting all over you.

544
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,300
你叫什麼來著
Who are you again?

545
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,340
蘭德爾  你爸爸來了
Randall, your daddy's here.

546
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,460
我們馬上完了
We're almost done.

547
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,910
三局兩勝
Best two out of three.

548
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,630
好
Okay.

549
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,280
謝謝你讓他來你家玩
Hey, thanks for -- thanks for having him.

550
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,120
他想來  我隨時歡迎
Oh, I will take him as much as he'll have it.

551
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,480
讓我家孩子也看看什麼叫禮貌
Show my own boys what manners look like.

552
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,860
麗貝卡告訴你  他在學校的事了嗎
Hey, did Rebecca tell you about his school?

553
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,630
沒有  怎麼了
No. What happened?

554
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,340
他好像是考試得了很高的分
I guess he scored off the charts on some tests,

555
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,380
現在校方想把他送走
and now they want to uproot him during the school year,

556
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,100
送去私立學院什麼的
send him to some private academy.

557
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,770
把他和其他兩個孩子分開
You know, take him away from the other two.

558
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,590
為什麼  那是個寄宿學校嗎
Why? Is it, is it a boarding school?

559
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,230
不是
No.

560
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,510
就是
No, it's, uh--

561
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:43,030
就是穿制服什麼的
it's uniforms and,

562
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,150
身邊全都是白人小孩
a lot of little white kids

563
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,720
搞得那媢閉O在德國納粹一樣
marching around like it's Nazi Germany.

564
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,110
我明白了
Oh, I see.

565
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,160
所以你才向我咨詢
That's why you're running this by me.

566
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,920
什麼
What?

567
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,110
你想找一個黑人批准你在育兒方面
You're looking for me to give you the black person seal of approval

568
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,140
做一個糟糕的決定
for any messed-up parenting decision you make.

569
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,470
怎麼就糟糕了  我只是...
How is it messed up? I just--

570
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,650
不想讓我兒子覺得自己更特殊而已
I don't want my son to feel more different.

571
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,890
所以就因為他是黑人  你就想阻礙他的發展
Okay, so you just want to hold him back because he's black?

572
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,970
不  當然不是了
No. Absolutely not. I...

573
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,050
傑克
Jack,

574
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,320
蘭德爾是個特別的孩子
Randall is special.

575
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:20,480
如果你讓他放棄如此好的一個機會
So, if you're looking for somebody to make you feel better

576
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,850
還期待別人會來安慰你
about denying him a special opportunity,

577
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,860
你還是另找一位黑人吧
you may just have to find yourself another black person.

578
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,940
再見了  夥計們
See you, guys.

579
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,590
準備好啦
Ready, Freddy.

580
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,250
再見  伊薇特夫人
Bye, Ms. Yvette.

581
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,820
-贏了嗎  -當然
- Did you win? - Yep.

582
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,790
當我把她的孩子送到她懷堮
And I'll never forget the look on her face

583
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,340
她的表情我永生難忘
when I placed her child back into her arms.

584
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,210
永生難忘
Never.

585
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,620
這就是我的工作
So, yeah, that's what I do.

586
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,300
日復一日地
Day in and day out,

587
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,860
將像你們這樣的孩子從火堭洏X來
I save children, just like you guys, from fires.

588
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,820
謝謝
Thank you.

589
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,550
大家為肯德爾的媽媽曼迪鼓掌
Let's give it up for Kendal's mom, Mandy! Yeah.

590
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,600
下一位是苔絲的爸爸  蘭德爾
All right, okay, uh, up next is Tess's dad, Randall,

591
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,100
他是位氣象員
who is a weatherman.

592
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,100
抱歉抱歉
Oh, sorry, sorry.

593
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,300
說錯了
Uh, strike that.

594
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,460
他是位天氣交易員
He's a weather trader.

595
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:37,200
我不知道這是幹什麼的  聽他解釋吧
I don't know what that is, but I think he's gonna tell us.

596
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
歡迎蘭德爾
Here's Randall.

597
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,700
你們好
Hey, y'all.

598
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,690
我是天氣交易員
I'm a weather trader,

599
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,450
我知道這個很難解釋
which I know can be a little bit hard to explain,

600
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,050
於是
and so, um,

601
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,550
我給你們寫了首歌
I wrote you guys a song about it.

602
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,650
爸爸不是不會彈鋼琴嗎
I thought Daddy couldn't play the piano?

603
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,070
爸爸的確不會啊
Daddy cannot.

604
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,340
*如果你*
*If you*

605
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,100
等等  等一下  抱歉
Wait, mm, hold on one second. Sorry about that.

606
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,410
天吶
Oh, sweet Jesus.

607
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,670
若你...
If you...

608
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,930
請稍等
Mm. One second, please.

609
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:28,250
*若你有家農場*
*If you've got a farm*

610
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:36,080
*你該知道玉米未來的成本*
*You should know the future cost of corn*

611
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,980
*所以簽一個承包合同*
*So buy yourself a contract to*

612
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:44,810
*保護自己的莊稼吧*
*Protect your crops.*

613
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:49,550
*驟雨  風暴或降雪*
*Rain, storm or snow*

614
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,250
*也許會影響*
*Might affect your*

615

618
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,610
大家一起來
Come on everybody.

619
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:09,350
*若你有家農場*
*If you've got a farm*

620
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:14,830
*你便知道玉米未來的成本*

621
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,820
{\an9}*所以簽一個承包合同*
*So buy yourself a contract*

622
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,740
別看他  別看
Look away. Just look away.

623
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,520
*保護自己的莊稼吧*
*To protect your crops.*

624
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,220
你在這堸
Ah, there you are.

625
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,640
我剛和格蕾絲在一起
I was with Grace.

626
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,680
誰
Who?

627
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,460
格蕾絲  弗蘭克的妻子  
Grace. Frank's wife.

628
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,390
為什麼
Why?

629
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,060
因為她很悲傷  她丈夫過世了
Because she's sad. Her husband died.

630
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,250
你為什麼跟我兇
Why are you mad at me?

631
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,770
因為我們不該來的
Because we shouldn't be here.

632
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,850
這不是一場戲
This is not a play.

633
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,380
她是一個真實的人
You know, she's a real person.

634
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,190
我也是一個真實的人
I'm a real person.

635
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,160
我能看出來  終於看出來了
Yeah, I can see that-- maybe for the first time.

636
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,040
你經歷過什麼
What happened to you?

637
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,830
我父親過世了
What happened is my dad died.

638
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:54,820
就是這樣
That's what.

639
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,070
而我因此痛恨他
And I hated him for it.

640
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,900
我曾一個月無法進食
And I couldn't eat for a month,

641
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,660
我曾每日醒來以淚洗面
and I used to wake myself up crying,

642
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,670
這樣就可以再次在淚水中入眠
so I could cry myself back to sleep again.

643
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,750
這就是我的經歷
That's what happened.

644
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,830
你為什麼將這些情感撇開
Why do you push all of that away?

645
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,720
這些不是你害怕的妖怪
You can't just kill the feelings

646
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:17,040
你無法扼殺自己的情緒
like they're some creature that you're afraid of.

647
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,090
這種痛楚是你的一部分
That pain is a part of you.

648
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,200
我現在能看出來
I can see it now.

649
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,100
也能感覺到
I can feel it.

650
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,430
抱歉  吃過醃菜
Sorry, pickle mouth.

651
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,790
我不介意
I don't care.

652
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,480
傑瑪還好嗎
Is Jemma OK?

653
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,130
什麼  她很好
What? She's fine.

654
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,380
她說今天和你相處得很愉快
She said she had a really nice day with you.

655
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,110
但我根本不信
Which I didn't believe for a second,

656
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,790
因為你沒有回來  所以我追問了她
because you didn't come back, so I pressed.

657
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,810
丟下她  我很抱歉
I am really sorry that I left her.

658
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,730
如果你想以遺棄兒童罪起訴
I can understand if you want to press charges

659
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:04,290
我可以理解
for child abandonment.

660
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,410
天吶  快別這麼說
God, don't even worry about it.

661
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,220
我自己還曾把她丟在三大百貨
I've left her at Three Malls myself,

662
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,880
而且不止一次在高速路上
and I've wanted to shove her out of the car

663
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,670
想把她從車堨嵽X去
on the freeway at least once.

664
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,720
我都不知道拿她怎麼辦了
I don't know what to do with her anymore.

665
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,210
我走不進她的內心
I can't reach her.

666
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,850
昨天之前
Before yesterday,

667
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,260
她在兩周堨u和我說過七個字
she's spoken seven words to me in two weeks.

668
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,380
你也聽到了
And you heard them:

669
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,350
"你雇了個胖子啊"
"I see you hired the fat one."

670
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,130
這是你雇我的原因嗎
Is that why you hired me?

671
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,870
不  天吶  當然不是
No! God, no.

672
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,300
不全是這樣
Not entirely.

673
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,270
我猜就是
Yeah, I thought so.

674
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,760
我也知道這樣不好
I am not proud of it.

675
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,010
我很抱歉  但那真不是唯一的原因
I am sorry and it's really not the only reason.

676
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,110
見你本人之前  我就很喜歡你的簡歷
I-I liked your resume before I met you.

677
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,690
但  確實
But, yeah.

678
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,830
我覺得你可能會...
I thought that maybe you'd be able to...

679
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,610
理解她
understand her.

680
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,470
理解她的問題
Her issues.

681
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,020
天吶  我這樣說出來
Oh, my God, it sounds horrible

682
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,200
太傷人了
when I say it out loud.

683
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,440
天吶  拜託別辭職
God, please don't quit.

684
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,180
別再讓我處理私人事務了
No more personal stuff.

685
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,730
你看到我工作  瞭解我的能力了
You saw my work; you know I can do it.

686
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,680
別再讓我開車帶傑瑪了
No more driving Jemma around.

687
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,550
你可以雇一個助手代勞的
You can afford an assistant for that.

688
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,790
-成交  -我要加入蝴蝶舞會
- Done. - And I want to chair the Butterfly Ball.

689
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,210
-可以  -我還要一間辦公室
- It's yours. - And I want an office.

690
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,810
-沒問題  -我還想要一個實習生
- Okay. - And I want an intern.

691
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,500
好吧  太過了
Okay, too far.

692
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,400
明天九點見
I'll see you at 9:00 tomorrow.

693
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,660
謝謝
Thank you.

694
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,610
傑瑪還在這媔
Hey, is Jemma still here?

695
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,650
在外面
She's outside.

696
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,690
好的
Okay.

697
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,890
喂喂  皮爾森公司
Hello? Hello? Pearson Corporation.

698
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,740
想談一單大生意嗎
Would you like to discuss the big deal?

699
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:45,560
我太忙了  你回頭打給我吧
Well, I'm too busy. You'll have to call back.

700
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,500
喜歡過來和爸爸一起工作  是不是
You love coming to work with Dad, huh?

701
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:53,160
我想讓你來幫我一些忙
I wanted you here because I need your help with something.

702
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:55,980
過來
Come here.

703
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,830
這是什麼
What's that?

704
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:02,020
這是公司負責在建的房子
That is a house the company's working on.

705
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,060
-真酷  -是啊
- Cool. - Yeah.

706
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,460
你看
You see, uh...

707
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:12,170
你看  我不知道  建這面牆需要多少
You see, I don't know how many feet of two-by-four

708
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,810
寬四寸厚二尺的板材
I'm gonna need for this wall right here.

709
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,280
你知道三英尺是多少...
You see how each... how each inch is...

710
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,180
多少英吋嗎
is three feet?

711
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,490
22.5英尺
22h feet.

712
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,160
真了不起  小傢伙
That's pretty cool, buddy.

713
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,910
沒想到你數學這麼好
Didn't know you were so good with numbers.

714
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,740
等等  過來
Wait, wait, wait. Come here.

715
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,790
那這面牆呢
What about this wall right here?

716
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,770
建這面牆需要多少
How many... how many do I need for that?

717
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,110
這個我不會算
I don't know that one.

718
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,380
一秒鐘前你還會算  現在不會了嗎
You knew how do it a second ago, now you don't?

719
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,650
我不知道  爸爸
I don't know it, Dad.

720
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,020
你肯定會算
I think you do.

721
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,930
我不會
I don't.

722
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,530
蘭德爾  別鬧了
Randall, that's enough.

723
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,660
-過來  -我不想算
- Come here. - I don't want to.

724
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,110
看  就是這面牆
Look. This wall, right here.

725
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,200
我需要多少板材
How much do I need?

726
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,660
-我不知道  不知道  -把答案說出來
- I don't know. I don't know. - Tell me the answer.

727
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,340
多少英尺  快告訴我
How many feet? Tell me right now.

728
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,140
我不知道
I don't know.

729
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,920
見鬼  蘭德爾  快說答案
Damn, it, Randall, tell me the answer!

730
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:06,750
34英尺
34.

731
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,960
說什麼
What's that?

732
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,240
34英尺
34.

733
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,190
很正確
That's right.

734
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:19,390
你為什麼要假裝不會算這些題呢
Why are you pretending not to know this stuff, huh?

735
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,410
故意在數學中考個B
Getting B's in math?

736
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,260
不讓別人知道你很聰明
Not letting people see how smart you are?

737
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,940
我不想和他們不一樣
I don't want to be different from them.

738
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,870
和誰不一樣  學校堥漕ヱ臚l嗎
Different from who? Who, the kids at school?

739
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:32,810
如果得了A  我就有冰激凌吃
If... if I get an A, I'll get ice cream,

740
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,170
而凱特和凱文沒有
and Kate and Kevin won't.

741
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,870
他們會恨我的
And then they'll hate me.

742
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,500
我能跟你說實話嗎
Can I be honest with you?

743
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,050
男人間的對話
Man to man?

744
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,640
你媽媽和我總是盡力
You know, your mom and me, we always try

745
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,040
對你們幾個一視同仁
to treat you kids the same.

746
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,330
一向如此
Always have.

747
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,330
但並不總是有效  
Hasn't always worked, because, well,

748
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,480
因為你們本來就不一樣
you're not all the same.

749
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,670
你是我們領養的  我們沒好好談過這事
You're adopted, and we don't talk about that enough.

750
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,250
因為對我來說  你完全就是我兒子
'Cause to me, you are every part my son.

751
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:14,420
也許...我不想讓你覺得自己太突出
Maybe I.. I don't want you to feel like you stand out.

752
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,280
但是你得知道一件事
But I need you to know something.

753
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,770
我希望你出類拔萃
I want you to stand out.

754
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:26,490
我希望你們每一個都能
I want all of you to be as different

755
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,820
與眾不同
as you can possibly be.

756
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,630
做最好的自己
In all the best ways.

757
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,320
我傾盡全力愛你  孩子
I love you as much as a human heart can, kiddo.

758
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:40,240
你是個出眾的年輕人
You are an exceptional young man.

759
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,140
別讓你爸卑微的想法
So don't let your dad's poor choice

760
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:48,680
阻礙你展現自我
make you feel afraid to be different.

761
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,100
好嗎
Okay?

762
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,390
好
Okay.

763
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,710
把手指放上去彈彈  聲音更美妙
It sounds better when you put your fingers on it.

764
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,070
在電影
You know how, in the movies,

765
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,660
主角不擅長一件事
when somebody's bad at something,

766
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,760
但又不想這樣
but they don't want to be,

767
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,470
於是就下定決心練習
and so they set their mind to it.

768
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,070
然後通過蒙太奇的剪輯手法
And then we see this montage

769
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,440
無數遍的練習鏡頭呈現在觀眾眼前
of them practicing and practicing.

770
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,970
而到了最後的關鍵時刻  就會大放異彩
And then comes the big moment, and they're amazing,

771
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,510
大家歡呼喝彩
and everybody cheers.

772
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,140
我看過這類電影
I've seen a few movies like that, yeah.

773
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,020
我可能跳過了"蒙太奇"部分
I think I skipped the montage.

774
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,070
你第一次告訴我你的工作時
When you first told me what you did for a living,

775
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,360
天  我一個字也聽不懂
man, I didn't understand a word.

776
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,660
對天發誓
Hand to God, I mean,

777
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,740
你還不如說些德語什麼的
you might as well have been speaking German.

778
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,610
但當時我看著你的表情
But I was watching your face.

779
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,790
我沒吸毒的時候  我曾與幾位
In my better days, I have met and played with

780
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,000
世界頂級音樂家一起演奏過
some of the greatest musicians in the world.

781
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,630
當他們談起音樂
And when they talked about music,

782
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,290
他們的表情看起來
their face looked like your face

783
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,140
和你談起工作時的表情一模一樣
when you told me about whatever the hell it is you do.

784
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,320
但是如果有幫助  我可以教你彈一兩段琴
But if it'll help, I can show you a thing or two on the piano.

785
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,690
那就太棒了
That would be great.

786
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,260
-今晚就算了  -對啊
- Oh, not tonight, just... - Oh, right.

787
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,930
-現在太晚了  -是啊  算了
- It's late is the thing. - Yeah. No.

788
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,650
我明白
I got ya.

789
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,990
晚安
Good night.

790
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,000
晚安
Night.

791
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,170
你不用和我告別
You don't have to say bye to me.

792
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,370
我沒辭職
I didn't quit.

793
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,520
我明白你的感受
I know what you're going through.

794
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,500
別想著和我促膝談心了
Stop trying to have a moment with me.

795
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,740
我媽以前很苗條  也很漂亮
So, my mom was skinny and gorgeous.

796
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,750
現在也很漂亮
Well, is gorgeous.

797
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,530
大家還是喜歡搭訕她
She still gets hit on by everyone.

798
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,950
有一次她得了流感  還被人問起
She once was asked if she was a model

799
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,260
是不是模特兒
when she had the flu.

800
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,360
在這樣的媽媽身邊長大非常艱難
Pretty hard growing up with a mom like that.

801
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,060
我一直不斷拿自己和她作比較
I spent all my time comparing myself to her,

802
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,510
然後把氣撒在她身上
and then I took it out on her.

803
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,720
現在我們幾乎不說話了  很糟糕
And now we barely talk, and it sucks.

804
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,090
你媽不完美
Hey, your mom's not perfect.

805
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,250
她有她的問題  你有你的問題  但是
She has her stuff, and you have yours, but...

806
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,520
你別再跟她對著幹了
you got to cut her a break.

807
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,090
不然你會後悔的
Or you're gonna regret it.

808
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,000
我保證
I promise.

809
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,300
凱特  能配合一下嗎
Kate, will you please help me out?

810
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,830
不  我討厭這件裙子
No, I hate this dress!

811
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:45,140
我知道  可是我不管你討不討厭
I know. I don't care that you hate it, though.

812
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,320
就這一件合身的乾淨衣服
It's what's clean and what fits,

813
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,460
-你穿定這件了  -我恨你
- and it's what you're wearing. - I hate you!

814
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,150
快穿上  我們要遲到了
Put it on, please; we're running late.

815
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,280
傑克
Hey, Jack?

816
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,240
-蘭德爾  你們準備好了嗎  -好了
- Randall? You guys are ready? - Yeah.

817
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,170
-五分鐘後得出發了  -我知道  有我呢
- We have to leave in five minutes. - I know. I got him.

818
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,710
你確定嗎
You sure about this?

819
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,070
對  我確定
Yeah, I'm sure.

820
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,740
聽你媽媽的話
Hey, listen to your mother.

821
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,090
你看上去棒極了
See, you look great.

822
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,880
拿好你的午飯  小姑娘
Come get your lunch, young lady.

823
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,240
謝謝
Thank you.

824
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,170
-看清沒有  -嗯
- See it? - Yeah.

825
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,340
需要點時間練習
Yeah. Takes a little time,

826
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,970
不過你會掌握竅門的
but you'll get the hang of it.

827
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,040
看著我
Here, look at me.

828
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,870
真精神
Looking sharp.

829
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,500
準備好上學第一天了嗎
You ready for your first day?

830
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,590
凱特和凱文會跟我們一起走嗎
Are Kate and Kevin gonna ride with us?

831
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,000
我們先把他們送到學校
We're gonna drop them off,

832
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,550
然後再把你送到學校
then we're gonna drop you off,

833
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,570
放學後  我們再一起回家
and then we'll all be back together

834
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,270
-好嗎  -好
- after school, okay? - Okay.

835
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,730
等等  過來
Hey, wait. Come here.

836
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,430
往下系點
We'll tuck this low.

837
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,600
這樣好看又舒服
Nice and comfortable.

838
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,560
去跟你媽說再見
Say bye to your mom.

839
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,210
新鮮出爐的煎餅來了
Hot, plump ones coming through.

840
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,160
媽  今天放學後我要去練足球
Mom, I have a soccer practice after school today.

841
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,460
我記得
Yeah, I remember.

842
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,360
過來
Come on.

843
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,580
我有話要說
I have something to say.

844
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:10,200
我父親每天都會系領帶
Uh... my dad put on a tie every day

845
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,360
因為他必須這樣做
because he had to.

846
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,680
我每天系領帶  是因為我想這樣
I put one on every day because I want to.

847
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,890
這點很重要
It's important you know that.

848
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,710
也許我不用每天靠出入火場來維持生計
Maybe I don't run into burning buildings for a living,

849
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:25,380
但對我來說  我的工作同樣驚險刺激
but to me, my work is challenging and exciting.

850
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,670
也許別人很難理解
I will not apologize for the fact

851
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,290
但我不會因此道歉
that it's hard to explain to people.

852
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,260
好的  老爸
Okay, Daddy.

853
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,230
還有  威廉
Uh, also, William,

854
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,860
謝謝你願意教我彈鋼琴
thank you for offering to teach me piano,

855
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,690
但我覺得
but I don't think at this point

856
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,410
鑒於我們現在的關係
in our relationship it would be healthy

857
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,450
還是先別這麼做了
to introduce that dynamic.

858
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,090
所以
And so,

859
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,910
下週二開始  我要去上
starting next Tuesday, I'm gonna be taking piano lessons

860
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,820
帕金斯女士的鋼琴課
from Mrs. Perkins down the road.

861
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,290
春天會有一場演奏會
There's gonna be a recital in the spring,

862
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:58,660
我希望你們都能來支持我
and I hope that you will all come and support me in this.

863
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,070
剛才是怎麼回事
What was that?

864
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,810
那是中年危機  親愛的
That was a midlife crisis, baby.

865
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,900
這還不算什麼  接著吃華夫餅吧
But just a little one, so go on, eat your waffle.

866
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,310
"還不算什麼"  說得真好
"Just a little one." That's good.

867
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,260
他竟然要學鋼琴
He-He's gonna take piano?

868
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,300
給你買了杯咖啡
Brought you a cappuccino.

869
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,950
牛奶換成豆奶  對嗎
Soy, yeah?

870
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,430
你太貼心了
You're too kind.

871
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,230
我還想說...
Also wanted to say that, uh...

872
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,550
我想說  我原諒你了
You know, I wanted to say that I forgive you.

873
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,860
那節"課"的事...
For the lesson. Um...

874
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,630
我能說什麼呢  奏效了
What can I say? It worked.

875
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,670
我覺得也是
Mm, I'd say it did.

876
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,180
不過課可不止那一節
But, um, that's not the only lesson.

877
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:41,610
不是嗎  好吧
No? Okay.

878
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,520
我們之間發生的事...
What happened between you and me...

879
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:48,970
永遠不會再發生了
is never gonna happen again.

880
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,790
我以為...
Oh. I-I thought...

881
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:56,450
我知道  但我們僅僅只是這種關係
I know you did, but this is who we are and all we are.

882
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:00,260
你是我丈夫  我是你的亡妻
You're my husband, and I'm your dead wife.

883
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:04,770
你永遠不會再和她上床了
And you will never sleep with her again.

884
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,730
這讓你作何感想
Now, how does that make you feel?

885
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,220
悲傷
Sad.

886
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:12,520
好極了
Great.

887
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,820
用上這種情緒
Use that.

888
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,330
我加入
I'm in.

889
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,730
{\an8}三個小傢伙之家

890
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,960
那隱形傳輸是怎麼回事
So what was that about teleportation?

891
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,500
隱形傳輸和冷空氣
Yeah, the teleportation and the freeze breath

892
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,550
或是熱空氣
or, like, hot breath.

893
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,510
玩得開心
Hey, have fun.

894
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,650
再見  爸爸
Bye, Dad.

895
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:05,270
愛你
Love you.
