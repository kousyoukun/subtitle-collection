00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,444

the-the teacher prejudiced?

No.

139

When a child tests well

140
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,453
but his grades
don't seem to reflect it,

141
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:56,121
oftentimes,
he isn't being challenged

142
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:57,522
at his school.

143
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:01,293

say "Jack."

168

this-this pinnacle of grief,
which should rip--

169
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:08,026
I mean, literally rip--
tears from the audience,

170
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:11,263

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,137

You know, maybe
it's in the words.
Sloane: How would you know?

175
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,709
You've never said them.
Uh, no,

176
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,144
I think...
I think I'm saying 'em.

177
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,913
No. I mean, yeah,
like, s-some.

178
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,282
Kind of. But you're-you're
mostly paraphrasing.

179
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,783
I'm sorry.
Yeah. Y-yeah.

180
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,452
You see,
it's really simple.

181
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:36,755
Olivia is Jessica,
your wife.

182
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:39,124
Okay.
You are David.

183
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:42,160
You loved her,

184
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,062
but now she is dead.

185
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:48,567
So you are grieving
the<i> loss</i> of her.

186
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,970
There's no longer
any such thing as gravity.

187
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,672
(Sighs)

188
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:56,141
Have you ever lost anyone?

189
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,442
Yes.

190
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:58,743
Because I don't believe you.

191
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,145
Well, you know, Ron,
it's not my job

192
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,413
to make sure
you believe me.
(Stammers)

193
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,415
Oh, yes, yes, it is! It is!

194
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:05,617
It is exactly your job!

195
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,586
Do your job.

196
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:08,753
What is she writing?

197
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:09,754
What are you
writing?

198
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,656
That's her suicide note.

199
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,091
Olivia: All right,
all right, enough,

200
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:13,992
okay?

201
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,028
He'll get there.

202
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,196
Ron:
(Sighs) Okay.

203
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,831
All right.

204
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,933
10:00 A.M. Tuesday, everybody.

205
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,336
Thank you.
It's a process.

206
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,271
Just... let it go for now.

207
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:29,207
Yeah.

208
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,643
What are you
doing tomorrow?

209
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,778
Oh. Uh, well, tomorrow
i was just gonna spend

210
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,680
the entire day feeling
like a failure, but, uh...

211
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,516
Come to a party with me.

212
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,951
A party? What kind of party
we talking?

213
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,454
I'll text you the address.
Yeah, okay. All right.

214
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:44,623
(Door opens)

215
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,725
(Birds chirping)

216
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,227
(Sighs) There's no way in hell.

217
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:52,130
This job better be worth it.

218
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,331
See ya, world.

219
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,233
It's been real.

220
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:58,637
Oh, Jesus.

221
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,138
(Water running)

222
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:03,141
You sure you're
all right?

223
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,410
Oh. Yeah, I'm good.

224
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:08,146
I'm good. Yeah. Yeah.

225
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,814
I'm good.

226
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,816
Uh, Mrs. rosenthal...

227
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:12,751
Marin.

228
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:15,220
Oh. Marin. (Chuckles)

229
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,756
I realize that my previous
employment with my brother

230
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,991
might not be
directly applicable.

231
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,661
However,
i am abnormally organized.

232
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,329
And I'm basically
the not crazy version

233
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,498
of Jack Nicholson
in<i> as good as it gets.</i>

234
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,066
Oh, I love that movie. Oh.
Right?

235
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,669
Both: "You make me want
to be a better man."

236
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:33,004
(Laughing)
Oh! Sorry.

237
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,406
I'm sorry,
you were saying...

238
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,775
No. I-i have
grant writing experience,

239
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:40,111
and I'm used to dealing with
Hollywood types, which I know

240
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,180
are large contributors
to your foundation.

241
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,583
And I know you're on the board
of stay in touch

242
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:45,917
and the butterfly ball.
Mm-hmm.

243
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,285
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

244
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,754
Um, Doug Kincaid,

245
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,957
your boss before
your brother, was it?

246
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,559
He speaks about you
in such glowing terms.

247
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,294
Why did you quit his firm?

248
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:59,698
Because I fell
in love with him,

249
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,800
and it was not
a healthy situation.

250
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,702
I like you, Kate.

251
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,103
You're qualified,
you're smart,

252
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,639
and I need someone
right now by my side.

253
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:09,107
Now, it's not
assistant work.

254
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,376
It's part event coordinator,
part development associate.

255
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:13,111
I would be absolutely thrilled.

256
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,481
But there is some personal
stuff you may have to do,

257
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,916
an errand here or there,

258
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:20,118
maybe drive my
daughter to and from?

259
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,386
Yeah. Okay.

260
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,221
Not much, so don't
worry about that.

261
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,389
No, of course.

262
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,224
Yeah.
So, do you want the gig?

263
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,792
Wait, really?

264
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,427
I'm so excited!
Oh!

265
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,730
Well, I'm so excited!
(Laughs)

266
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,064
Oh, I wanted you
from the moment

267
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,833
the toilet paper was
stuck to your head.

268
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,235
Seriously, though,
whatever you need,

269
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,070
I'm your girl.

270
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,739
(Typing on phone)
Oh, hey,

271
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:43,508
this is my daughter.
Jemma, this is Kate.

272
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,677
So, I see you picked
the fat one.

273
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,879
(Continues typing)

274
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:51,316
Oh.

275
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,318
♪ ♪

276
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,595
weather derivatives
are tradable commodities

277
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:05,830
that protect business owners

278
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:09,000
from future changes
in the weather.

279
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,369
It's like licking
a piece of pizza

280
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:14,039
so that nobody
will eat it later.

281
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,509
Now I'm thinking about pizza.

282
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,512
Okay.
No, wait,
I'm sorry-- no, no, no, wait,

283
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,614
I was gonna get it this time.
Look, how am i
supposed to inspire

284
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:24,816
an auditorium full of strangers,
and my own wife and kids

285
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,017
don't even understand
what I do?

286
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,019
That's not true.
Really?

287
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,689
What do I do?

288
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,358
You trade weather.

289
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,994
You trade commodities
based on weather patterns.

290
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,395
And what does that mean?

291
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,531
Oh, damn, Randall, I don't know.

292
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,666
(Clicks tongue)
You swap lightning bolts
for thunder clouds?

293
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:42,901
(Sighs)

294
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,869
Look, I know what
your day is like.

295
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,805
I know that you like
one of your partners

296
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,373
and you hate the other one.

297
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,842
I know that you're gonna
redesign your office furniture

298
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,410
and that you might fire
your assistant

299
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,379
because she says
"like" too much.
It's nonstop.

300
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,082
Can I talk to you in depth
about weather patterns?

301
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:58,650
No, I cannot.

302
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:01,352
But I don't think you'd
want me to if I could, so...

303
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,656
Hey, what's-what's this
really about?

304
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,660
Maybe I was meant
to be a musician.

305
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:10,328
I'm sorry, what now?

306
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,830
Or an artist or a writer.

307
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,665
Just think about it, Beth.

308
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,767
There's this whole
genetic side of me

309
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,569
that nobody even knew existed.

310
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,206
I mean, William was a poet,

311
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,208
an artist, a musician.

312
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,744
You know, maybe I've had
an artistic side in me all along

313
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,545
and nobody knew to empower it.

314
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,180
You know, maybe
i wasn't meant to be

315
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,082
a straight and narrow math geek

316
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,584
destined to wear a
shirt and tie every day

317
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:33,585
like my parents thought.

318
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:34,619
Maybe I was meant to live

319
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,387
a musician's life.

320
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:39,624
On the road and playing clubs,
you know?

321
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:43,361
All right, well, in this musical
fantasy version of yourself,

322
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,196
what instrument would you...
Sax.

323
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,098
Mm.
Like Wesley in<i> mo' better blues.</i>

324
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,399
Definitely sax.

325
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,768
Oh, yeah.

326
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,102
That's sexy, yeah.

327
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,437
You're making fun of me.

328
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,439
No.
No, you're making fun of me.

329
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,474
No, I am not. I'm-I'm not.

330
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:59,277
Your biological father
just came back into your life,

331
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,112
and it's bringing up
all kinds of stuff.

332
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,814
It's-it's normal.

333
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,482
Look,

334
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:09,254
why don't you try out
this-this crazy artist side

335
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:12,757
of yourself and, you know,
get this presentation popping.

336
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,794
Let's see how it flies with
some eight-year-olds, right?

337
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,395
Before you, like,
shift careers

338
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:20,298
and start playing
open mic saxophone nights.

339
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,800
You know, maybe I will.
Okay, yeah.

340
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:24,302
I see you are making
fun of me, but I will.
No, yeah.

341
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,137
Why don't you stop smiling?
I can't.

342
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,939
Stop smiling.
I'm sorry.

343
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:31,242
This early midlife crisis
is so you, I can't stand it.

350
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,161
hi, can I speak
to Michael please?

351
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,696
Hey, Tanner, it's Kate.

352
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,364
Yeah, Kevin's sister.
How are you?

353
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,533
Oh, good. Are you by any chance

354
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:56,968
available on the third
for a charity event?

355
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,336
Hey, I have a
question for you:

356
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,470
How do you feel
about homelessness?

357
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:00,839
I know, it's a
bummer, right?

358
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,006
<i> So, we're looking to cater</i>

359
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,374
about 400 people.

360
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,943
Your restaurant's definitely
gonna want to be a part of this.

361
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:07,779
Oh, my-- I know. Um...

362
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:08,813
Awesome, okay, great.

363
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,181
Thanks, z. Bye.

364
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,783
You're killer.

365
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:14,319
(Chuckles)

366
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:15,687
I need you to take me
to Ashley's.

367
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,689
Oh, well, what if
Kate gave you a ride?

368
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:18,857
Do you mind?

369
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,024
(Ringtone plays)

370
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,226
No.
Hi.

371
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:22,760
(Whispers):
Sorry.

372
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,398
I'll be in the car, intern.

373
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,577
Hey.

374
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,713
Hey.

375
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,014
Should we go in?
Yeah.

376
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:45,016
Listen, what kind of party
is this anyway?

377
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,150
'Cause everyone
seems pretty sad.

378
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:47,352
Of course they're sad.

379
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,020
It's a memorial service.

380
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,221
Come on, in we go,

381
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,790
before all the good cheese
is gone.

382
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:55,827
(School bell rings)

383
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,731
What are we doing here?

384
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,599
Rebecca:
We are here

385
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,902
because your wife--
do you remember her?

386
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,270
I think so, yeah.

387
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:07,205
The one that you love
more than life itself?

388
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,673
Definitely rings a bell.
Got it.

389
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:11,276
She wants to take a
look at this place.

390
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,211
Jack:
Okay, I'm looking.

391
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,747
Geez, this place is whiter

392
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:20,051
than Randall's already
pretty white other school.

393
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,020
I mean, look at these kids.

394
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:24,122
They look like little

395
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,423
Nazi robots.

396
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,091
That one's got a briefcase.

397
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:30,228
I... no kid should be
carrying a briefcase.

398
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,796
I think it's cute.

399
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,631
Yeah, it's cute now; Next thing
you know, he's gonna be

400
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,433
trapped in a cubicle
for the rest of his life.

401
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,435
I tell you, it starts
with a briefcase,

402
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,437
then you put on a tie,
you sit at a desk.

403
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,306
Next thing you know,
you are so conditioned

404
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,574
to the florescent lights
that when you step outside,

405
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,877
the sun actually
burns your eyes.

406
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,245
Wow.

407
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,147
Yeah.

408
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,115
Wow. Really?

409
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,952
This isn't about me.

410
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:57,188
Well, it certainly
isn't about Randall.

411
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,259
Hey.

412
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,461
Look, I...
I wasn't gonna say anything

413
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:07,565
until I'd had a few
details worked out, but...

414
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,435
I think I'm gonna
go out on my own.

415
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,103
Start my own company.

416
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:15,306
Big three homes. I just...

417
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:20,078
Doesn't feel like
a very good time right now.

418
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,847
(Chuckles)

419
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,482
I think it's great.

420
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,250
I think you
should do it.

421
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:28,853
(Sighs)
It's not that easy, bec.

422
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:32,490
I mean...
What does this place even cost?

423
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,859
We'll figure it out.

424
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,862
We'll figure it out-- we'll
send Randall to another school,

425
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,832
we'll get him a tutor,
we'll do whatever we have to do.

426
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,801
All right.

427
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,769
I just don't want
you to be unhappy.

428
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,738
I mean it.
Okay.

429
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,876
All right.

430
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,311
We'll come back.

431
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:54,445
(Engine starts)

432
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:55,880
This is nice.

433
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,949
Rebecca:
It's very nice.

434
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,984
(Typing on phone)

435
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,553
Jemma, your mom told me
that you would be giving me

436
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,355
Ashley's address.

437
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,524
(Phone chiming)

438
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,426
Jemma, will you answer me?

439
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,497
Jemma, I'm gonna
need the address.

440
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:13,798
Why?

441
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,467
'Cause you need to get
back to work?
Yes.

442
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,668
And if I didn't value the work,

443
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,203
I wouldn't be tolerating
this attitude.

444
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,838
Just so we're clear.

445
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,976
(Scoffs) What'd she tell you,
you'd be an associate?

446
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:26,144
And you thought my mom was gonna

447
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:27,545
give you actual
responsibilities,

448
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,214
because a few c-list celebrities
take your calls?

449
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,350
Clearly she only hired you
because she thinks

450
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,519
the fat girl
can get through to me.

451
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,687
Guess she figured,
bigger the better.

452
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:39,657
You know, I actually
feel bad for you.

453
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,392
(Tires screech)
What the hell?

454
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,495
Yeah, well, don't feel
bad for me, okay?

455
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,030
'Cause I have a ride home.

456
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,231
I'm sorry?

457
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,267
Get out.
What?

458
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:53,471
Get out of the damn car, jemma,
before I toss you out of it!

459
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,942
Oh, and you know what?
You can walk to Ashley's.

460
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,611
And fat girl to fat girl,
if you keep up the pace,

461
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,815
you can burn 417 calories
an hour walking.

462
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,258
I love American cheese. Mm.

463
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,028
English cheese is so
blue, it's angry.
Yeah.

464
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,765
American cheese is like a...
A bed you can just fall into.

465
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,568
So, whose good-bye party
is this anyway?

466
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,704
Frank pendergrass-- tree branch
fell on him three days ago

467
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,473
when he was jogging
through central park.

468
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:29,907
Bang. Dead.

469
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,442
Well, that sucks.
Mm-hmm.

470
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,944
You knew him how?

471
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,879
Oh, I didn't. No, the
obituary gave the address

472
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,481
of the service so, I thought...

473
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,715
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on a second.

474
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,117
What are you trying to say?

475
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,418
Hello.

476
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,720
I'm Frank's wife, grace.

477
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,755
(Quietly):
Hi.

478
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,290
(American accent):
Hi. Uh, I'm Jessica.

479
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,426
This is my husband, David.
Oh.

480
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,728
Were you students
of my husband?

481
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,630
We actually met in his class.

482
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,866
Oh.
Right?

483
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,570
Students.

484
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:00,638
Mm.

485
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,640
Olivia: Yeah, we were sitting
in the front row,

486
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,008
and we kept looking
at each other,

487
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,177
and then finally Frank stopped
the class and said,

488
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,646
"you two are distracting me.
Go outside, have sex,

489
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,249
and come back when you're ready
to learn something."

490
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,284
(Chuckles)
Well, that sounds like Frank.

491
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:14,652
Yeah.

492
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,820
(Quietly):
Frank.

493
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,788
Thank you both
so much for coming.

494
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,291
Kevin: Thank you for coming.
I'm so sorry for your loss.

495
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:21,993
Thank you.

496
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,662
(Normal voice):
Well done.

497
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,098
No, no, no, hold on.
No, no, no. You brought...

498
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,499
(Whispers):
You brought me

499
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,834
to a stranger's funeral?

500
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,203
Memorial service.
Whatever. Why, huh?

501
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,938
What, because I'm struggling
with the grief scene?

502
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,373
You said I would get there.

503
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,441
Yeah, well, I didn't say
you'd get there on your own.

504
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,676
This is insane.

505
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,344
But thank you very much
for the lesson.

506
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,680
I appreciate it.
Now I'm gonna go have a drink.

507
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,348
Enjoy your cheese.

508
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,688
Hey, baby, what happened
to<i> jungle book?</i>

509
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,024
It's over.

510
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,126
Well, mommy snuck in
a quick shower-- shh.

511
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:57,595
Got to get them in
while you can, little bug.

512
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,531
You're so pretty.

513
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,533
(Chuckles)
Thank you, baby.

514
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:06,003
Well, if I'm pretty, you're
pretty, 'cause we look alike.

515
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,371
Oh, can you get

516
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,041
mommy's yellow blouse,
the one with the buttons?

517
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,143
Just in the closet? Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

518
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,279
(Sighs):
Ooh.

519
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,491
Thank you, bug.

520
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:28,726
Mwah.

521
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,328
Okay, I'm going to
pick up Randall.

522
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,829
Good-bye, beautiful.

523
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,731
Bye, see you later.
All right, baby,

524
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,766
I'm almost done getting ready.

525
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,071
Tonight, little man,
you, me and a b-52?
Okay!

526
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,073
Okay, don't finish it;
I got to help with something.

527
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,641
Sounds good.

528
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:48,145
(Sighs, mumbles)

529
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,017
I'm sorry. I was,
i was, uh...

530
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:56,587
People keep bringing me things,
like I forgot how to cook.

531
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,222
Mm, there's no room in here

532
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:01,959
and I don't know where to put
all of Frank's food.

533
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,798
(Sighs)

534
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:10,935
You have a lot
of pickles.

535
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:11,969
(Chuckles)

536
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,774
I hate pickles.
Mm-hmm.

537
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,376
But he loves them.

538
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:21,212
Yeah, he eats them in bed.

539
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,483
"Ate."

540
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:27,818
He is now past tense.

541
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,289
He used to be "is."

542
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,024
Now he is "was."

543
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,663
Hey, I like pickles.

544
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:40,898
Good.

545
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,733
Here.
Okay.

546
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:48,339
How do you feel
about holiday ties?

547
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:49,974
And sport coats.

548
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,475
Because I asked Jeremy,

549
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:55,980
but he said he didn't
want anything of his dad's.

550
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,815
Yeah.

551
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:02,253
How old is Jeremy?

552
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:03,721
Fifteen.

553
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:07,325
That's tough.

554
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,393
15 is tough.

555
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:14,165
Uh, my dad and I...

556
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:17,601
Used to build models
together, when I was a kid.

557
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,003
Yeah?

558
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,273
Yeah, we'd build, um,
planes and boats.

559
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:24,508
I used to pick the
most complex ones--

560
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,344
b-52s, aircraft carriers--

561
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,212
'cause they took the
longest, you know?

562
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:30,114
See, I was one
of three kids,

563
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:32,149
so you really had to strategize
to get your alone time with dad.

564
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:33,517
(Chuckles)
You know, and eventually,

565
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,853
we had a whole fleet of them;
We had just rows and rows,

566
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,054
shelves of them.

567
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,790
You know, and then
when he died...

568
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,959
...when...

569
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:44,295
When he, when he died, I, um...

570
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:50,368
...i... I threw all
the models away.

571
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,169
I threw every one
of them away.

572
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:55,873
I don't know why...
Why I did that, you know?

573
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,008
You were how old?

574
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,811
Uh, it was a
long time ago.

575
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:04,582
I have, um...

576
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:06,917
I have this.
(Sniffles)

577
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:09,887
This necklace, this
is his and, um,

578
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,724
it's the only thing
i have left of him.

579
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,826
And at first, you know,
i didn't want to wear it,

580
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:19,230
I wouldn't wear it, I wouldn't
even look at it, but now it's...

581
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,667
It's all I have and i-i
can't take it off now, so...

582
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:24,769
(Sniffles)

583
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:27,471
It's okay.

584
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:35,146
(Crying)

585
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:39,750
(Sniffles)

586
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,285
Oh, my God,
this is so dumb.

587
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:42,686
What am I doing?
I'm... (Sniffles)

588
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:45,756
Supposed to be comforting you,
not snotting all over you.

589
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,258
(Laughs)

590
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,161
Grace:
Who are you again?

591
00:23:58,771 --> 00:23:59,770
Hey.
Hi.

592
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:00,938
Randall,

593
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,907
your daddy's here.
Randall: We're almost done.

594
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:04,708
Best two out of three.

595
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,043
Okay.

596
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,248
Hey, thanks for...
Thanks for having him.

597
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,818
Oh, I will take him
as much as he'll have it.

598
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,786
Show my own boys
what manners look like.

599
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,222
(Chuckles)
Okay.

600
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:20,157
Um...

601
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,461
Hey, did Rebecca tell
you about his school?

602
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:25,663
No. What happened?

603
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:29,133
I guess he scored off
the charts on some tests,

604
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:32,002
and now they want to uproot him
during the school year,

605
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,004
send him to some
private academy.

606
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,506
You know, take him away
from the other two.

607
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:37,141
Why? Is it, is it
a boarding school?

608
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:37,975
No.

609
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,610
No, it's, uh...

610
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:42,813
It's uniforms and...

611
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,982
A lot of little white kids

612
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,318
marching around like
it's Nazi Germany.

613
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,653
Oh, I see.

614
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,889
That's why you're
running this by me.

615
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:54,158
What?

616
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,326
You're looking for me
to give you

617
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,994
the black person
seal of approval

618
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,997
for any messed-up
parenting decision you make.

619
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,132
How is it messed up? I just--

620
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:05,002
I don't want my son
to feel more different.

621
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:08,772
Okay, so you just want to hold
him back because he's black?

622
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:11,609
No. Absolutely not. I...

623
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:13,344
Jack,

624
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:15,980
Randall is special.
Yeah.

625
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:20,217
So, if you're looking for
somebody to make you feel better

626
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:24,522
about denying him
a special opportunity,

627
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:27,925
you may just have to find
yourself another black person.

628
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,794
See you, guys.

629
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:32,530

Why?

684
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,378
Because she's sad.
Her husband died.

685
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,113
Why are you mad at me?

686
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:41,018

Yeah, I can see that--
maybe for the first time.

00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:51,895
What happened to you?

692
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,597
What happened is my dad died.

693
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,232
That's what.

694
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:58,936
And I hated him for it.

695
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:00,537
And I couldn't eat for a month,

696
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,406
and I used to
wake myself up crying,

697
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,341
so I could cry myself
back to sleep again.

698
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:07,344

00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,054
like they're some creature
that you're afraid of.

702
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:20,357
That pain is
a part of you.

703
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:23,260
I can see it now.

704
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,329
I can feel it.

705
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:32,636
(Moans softly)

706
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:34,638
Sorry, pickle mouth.

707
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,373
I don't care.

708
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:45,983
Is jemma okay?

709
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:47,551
What? She's fine.

710
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:50,220
She said she had
a really nice day with you.

711
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:52,489
Which I didn't believe
for a second,

712
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:55,325
because you didn't come back,
so I pressed.

713
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:59,963
I am really sorry
that I left her.

714
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,232
I can understand
if you want to press charges

715
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,901
for child abandonment.

716
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:05,903
God, don't even
worry about it.

717
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:07,404
I've left her at
three malls myself,

718
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,306
and I've wanted to shove
her out of the car

719
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,241
on the freeway
at least once.

720
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:13,577
I don't know what to do
with her anymore.

721
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:16,747
I can't reach her.

722
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:18,448
Before yesterday,

723
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,618
she's spoken seven words
to me in two weeks.

724
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,920
And you heard them:

725
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,955
"I see you hired
the fat one."

726
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:25,956
(Sighs)

727
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:27,624
Is that why you hired me?

728
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:30,794
No! God, no.

729
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:32,196
Not entirely.

730
00:30:32,198 --> 00:30:33,931
Yeah, I thought so.

731
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:35,365
I am not proud of it.

732
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,368
I am sorry and it's really
not the only reason.

733
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:42,539
I-i liked your resume
before I met you.

734
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:45,042
But, yeah.

735
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:47,211
I thought that maybe
you'd be able to...

736
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:49,046
Understand her.

737
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:51,114
Her issues.

738
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:53,350
Oh, my God, it
sounds horrible

739
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,452
when I say it out loud.

740
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:58,121
God, please don't quit.

741
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,691
(Chuckles softly)

742
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:05,395
No more personal stuff.

743
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:08,298
You saw my work;
You know I can do it.

744
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,300
No more driving jemma around.

745
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:12,135
Yu can afford
an assistant for that.

746
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,204
Done.
And I want to chair
the butterfly ball.

747
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,806
It's yours.
And I want an office.

748
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:17,307
Okay.
And I want an intern.

749
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,344
Okay, too far.

750
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:22,145
(Sighs)

751
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,482
I'll see you
at 9:00 tomorrow.

752
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,050
Thank you.

753
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:29,653
(Sighs)

754
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:30,921
Hey, is jemma still here?

755
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:31,989
She's outside.

756
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:34,224
(Softly):
Okay.

757
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:39,263
Hello? Hello?
Pearson corporation.

758
00:31:39,265 --> 00:31:41,498
Would you like to
discuss the big deal?

759
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,002
Well, I'm too busy.
You'll have to call back.

760
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:47,537
You love coming
to work with dad, huh?

761
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:53,510
I wanted you here because
i need your help with something.

762
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,612
Come here.

763
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:58,582
What's that?

764
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:01,752
That is a house
the company's working on.

765
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:04,621
Cool.
Yeah.

766
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:07,024
You see, uh...

767
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:09,593
You see, I don't know

768
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:12,195
how many feet of two-by-four
I'm gonna need

769
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:13,530
for this wall
right here.

770
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:15,699
You see how each...
How each inch is...

771
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:16,733
Is three feet?

772
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:19,269
22h feet.

773
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,038
Wow.

774
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,539
That's pretty cool, buddy.

775
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:25,108
Didn't know you were
so good with numbers.

776
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,544
Wait, wait, wait.
Come here.

777
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:31,114
What about this wall
right here?

778
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,383
How many... how many
do I need for that?

779
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:35,619
I don't know that one.

780
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:41,058
You knew how do it
a second ago, now you don't?

781
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,259
I don't know it, dad.

782
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:43,593
I think you do.

783
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,729
I don't.

784
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:48,065
Randall, that's enough.

785
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:50,434
Come here.
I don't want to.

786
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:53,804
Look. This wall, right here.

787
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:55,472
How much do I need?

788
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:58,008
I don't know.
I don't know.
Tell me the answer.

789
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,409
How many feet?
Tell me right now.

790
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:00,577
I don't know.

791
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:02,846
Damn, it, Randall,
tell me the answer!

792
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:06,116
(Whispers):
34.

793
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:07,918
What's that?

794
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,519
34.

795
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:15,225
That's right.

796
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:19,930
Why are you pretending
not to know this stuff, huh?

797
00:33:19,932 --> 00:33:21,598
Getting b's in math?

798
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,600
Not letting people see
how smart you are?

799
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:25,702
I don't want to be
different from them.

800
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:28,305
Different from who?
Who, the kids at school?

801
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:32,275
If... if I get an a,
I'll get ice cream,

802
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:33,877
and Kate and Kevin won't.

803
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,679
And then they'll hate me.

804
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,189
Can I be honest with you?

805
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,391
Man to man?

806
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:50,027
You know, your mom and me,
we always try

807
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:52,029
to treat you kids
the same.

808
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:54,898
Always have.

809
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,300
Hasn't always worked,
because, well,

810
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:58,869
you're not all the same.

811
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:03,974
You're adopted, and we don't
talk about that enough.

812
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:06,810
'Cause to me,
you are every part my son.

813
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:14,284
Maybe I.. I don't want you
to feel like you stand out.

814
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:19,256
But I need you
to know something.

815
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,526
I want you to stand out.

816
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:25,929
I want all of you
to be as different

817
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:28,999
as you can possibly be.

818
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:30,901
In all the best ways.

819
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:36,406
I love you as much as
a human heart can, kiddo.

820
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:40,243
You are an exceptional
young man.

821
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:43,447
So don't let your dad's

822
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:49,619
poor choice make you feel afraid
to be different.

823
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,855
Okay?

824
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:54,758
Okay.

825
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,466
(Whispers):
Okay.

826
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:16,246
Sounds better when you
put your fingers on it.

827
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:18,782
Hmm.

828
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,951
You know how,
in the movies,

829
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,586
when somebody's bad
at something,

830
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:24,054
but they don't want to be,

831
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:27,090
and so they set
their mind to it.

832
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:28,959
And then we see this montage

833
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,328
of them practicing
and practicing.

834
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,798
And then comes the big moment,
and they're amazing,

835
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,166
and everybody cheers.

836
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:39,469
I've seen a few movies
like that, yeah.

837
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,404
I think I skipped the montage.

838
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:42,873
(Both chuckle)

839
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:48,178
When you first told me
what you did for a living,

840
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,679
man, I didn't
understand a word.

841
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:51,114
Hand to God, I mean,

842
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:54,117
you might as well have
been speaking German.

843
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:57,154
But I was watching
your face.

844
00:35:57,156 --> 00:36:00,290
In my better days,
i have met and played with

845
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:03,160
some of the greatest
musicians in the world.

846
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,629
And when they talked
about music,

847
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:07,664
their face looked
like your face

848
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:12,035
when you told me about
whatever the hell it is you do.

849
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:15,172
But if it'll help, I can
show you a thing or two

850
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:16,339
on the piano.

851
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,674
That would be great.

852
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,843
Oh, not tonight, just...
Oh, right.

853
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,312
It's late is the thing.
Yeah. No.

854
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:23,413
I got ya.

855
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:27,117
Good night.

856
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,285
Night.

857
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,790
(Phone chiming)

858
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:38,962
You don't have to
say bye to me.

859
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:40,764
I didn't quit.

860
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:48,471
I know what
you're going through.

861
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:51,374
Stop trying to have
a moment with me.

862
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:00,717
So, my mom was skinny
and gorgeous.

863
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,852
Well,<i> is</i> gorgeous.

864
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:05,355
She still gets
hit on by everyone.

865
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:07,891
She once was asked
if she was a model

866
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,226
when she had the flu.

867
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:13,363
Pretty hard growing up
with a mom like that.

868
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:15,899
I spent all my time
comparing myself to her,

869
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,901
and then I took it out on her.

870
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:20,570
And now we barely talk,
and it sucks.

871
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:26,276
Hey, your mom's
not perfect.

872
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:29,212
She has her stuff,
and you have yours, but...

873
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:33,049
You got to cut her a break.

874
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:35,385
Or you're gonna regret it.

875
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:36,987
I promise.

876
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,091
Kate, will you please
help me out?

877
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:42,559
No, I hate this dress!

878
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:44,861
I know. I don't care
that you hate it, though.

879
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:46,229
It's what's clean
and what fits,

880
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:48,431
and it's what you're wearing.
I hate you!

881
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:52,035
Put it on, please;
We're running late.

Hey, Jack?
Jack: Yeah?

Randall?
You guys are ready?
Yeah.

884
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,940
We have to leave

I know. I got him.

886
00:37:58,777 --> 00:37:59,943
Yeah, I'm sure.

887
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:02,646
Hey, listen to
your mother.

888
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:04,781
See, you look great.

889
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:07,150
Come get your lunch,
young lady.

890
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:08,451
Thank you.

See it?
Yeah.

894

Yeah. Takes a little time,

We're gonna

Oh, um, mom,

911
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,664
I have a soccer practice
after school today.

912
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:55,699
Yeah, I remember.

I have something to say.

915
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:10,046
Uh... my dad put on
a tie every day

916
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:12,015
because he had to.

917
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:14,417
I put one on every day
because I want to.

918
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:17,887
It's important
you know that.

919
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:21,324
Maybe I don't run into
burning buildings for a living,

920
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:25,528
but to me, my work is
challenging and exciting.

921
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,364
I will not apologize
for the fact

922
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:29,699
that it's hard to explain
to people.

923
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,368
Okay, daddy.

924
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:35,638
Uh, also, William,

925
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,874
thank you for offering
to teach me piano,

926
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,542
but I don't think
at this point

927
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,211
in our relationship
it would be healthy

928
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:43,113
to introduce
that dynamic.

929
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,316
And so,

930
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:48,885
starting next Tuesday, I'm gonna
be taking piano lessons

931
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,620
from Mrs. Perkins down the road.

932
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,225
There's gonna be
a recital in the spring,

933
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:58,628
and I hope that you will all
come and support me in this.

934
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,071
What was that?

935
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,606
That was a midlife crisis, baby.

936
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:13,243
But just a little one,
so go on, eat your waffle.

937

938
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:16,179
"Just a little one."
That's good.

939
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:18,448
He-he's gonna take piano?

940
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,749
Psst, hey!

941
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:20,884
Brought you a cappuccino.

00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,954
You're too kind.
Yeah.

945
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:27,524
Also wanted to say
that, uh...

946
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:29,926
You know, I wanted to say
that I forgive you.

947
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,361
For the lesson. Um...

948
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:35,231
What can I say?
It worked.

949
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,033
Mm, I'd say it did.
Yeah.

950
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:39,869
But, um, that's not
the only lesson.

951
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:42,272
No? Okay.

952
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:45,442
What happened
between you and me...

953
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:49,345
...is never gonna happen again.

954
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:52,449
Oh. I-i thought...

955
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:54,784
I know you did,
but this is who we are

956
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,386
and all we are.

957
00:40:56,388 --> 00:41:00,557
You're my husband,
and I'm your dead wife.

And you will never
sleep with her again.
