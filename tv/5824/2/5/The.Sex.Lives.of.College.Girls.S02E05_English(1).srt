I just got amazing news.

8
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:20,658
Theta's charter officially
got reinstated,

9
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,498
which means they can
finally throw parties again.

10
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,857
- Yes!
- Oh, hell yes!

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,376
- Oh, my God.
- Obviously, we have to

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,068
make up for lost time,
go to all of them,

13
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,445
and look super slutty.

14
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,488
The names of these parties
are insane.

15
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,615
Threesome Thursday,
Fuck Me Friday,

16
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,451
and Sit On My Face Saturday.

17
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,162
They are gonna get kicked
off this campus again so fast.

18
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,705
We better party while we can.

19
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,292
This is gonna be
a really exciting week.

20
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,128
Especially because
of this little guy.

21
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,549
Um, everyone sees Kimberly's
holding a needle, right?

22
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,092
These are my hormone injections.

23
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,304
They coach my body
into making tons of eggs.

24
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,614
Do they make your boobs bigger?

25
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,348
If so, can I have three?
No.

26
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,808
But the side effects aren't bad.

27
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,372
The only bummer
is that I can't drink.

28
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,686
But it's Theta's party week.

29
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,979
You'll be a sober dud.

30
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:04,290
You don't have to drink
to have fun.

31
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,482
Who has to drink to have fun?

32
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,983
- I do.
- Everyone in college.

33
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:08,568
I'm tipsy right now.

34
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,629
Well, can one of you help me
with the first injection?

35
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,739
I don't like watching things
go under my skin.

36
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,365
Yeah, I'll do it.
But, uh,

37
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,493
what happens
if I hit your bones?

38
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,911
Where... where are your bones?

39
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,037
Sorry, I... I can't do it.

40
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,222
I'm in my head about the bones.

41
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,246
Oh, my God.

42
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,875
Just give it to me, please.

43
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,543
Ohh.

44
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,587
Wow, she's really doing it.

45
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,217
- Ow, my bone!
- Ahh!

46
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,220
Just kidding.

47
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,013
See, I am fun when I'm sober.

48

00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,817
Hey, Whit, I forgot
to do Biochem again.

53
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,419
Can I say it's 'cause
your grandma died?

54
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,694
I already used up all mine.

55
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,196
No. That's horrible.

56
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,115
Plus, I might need a grandma
to kill during midterms.

57
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,118
Oh, shit, guys.
Jackson's running towards us.

58
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,346
What do I do?
What should I say?

59
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,496
Um, well, he straight up

60
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,872
called you sexy at the KJ house.

61
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,999
Say something hot.
Okay.

62
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,626
You got it.

63
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,711
Ow, ow!
Big boy runs fast!

64
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,006
What did you say?

65
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,927
I said, big boy runs fast.

66
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,471
Right.

67
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,098
Bye.

68
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,726
You had a second chance,
and you said that shit again?

69
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,371
Yeah, yeah, you're ruining
this for us.

70
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,813
- Us?
- Yes, us.

71
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,582
Our suite is like a friggin'
sexual black hole.

72
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,692
Leighton got chlamydia,
I'm banging Where's Waldo,

73
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:31,836
and Whitney just got dumped.

74
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,069
We need this.
Okay.

75
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:34,737
Yeah, okay.
It's true, I got dumped.

76
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,573
But, guys, I'm over Canaan.

77
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,616
Actually, I already have my eye
on someone

78
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,118
I'm excited
to get to know better.

79
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,287
Yes! Now we're talkin'.
Who is it?

80
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,289
Her name is Whitney.
It's me.

81
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,748
I'm excited to love myself.

82
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,126
- Aw, that's beautiful.
- I hated that.

83
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,669
Uh-oh, he's running back again.

84
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,296
I'm gonna go duck
into a building.

85
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,755
Smart.

86
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,591
What should I wear
to the Theta tonight,

87
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,551
outfit one...

88
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,094
Or option two?

89
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,555
- Are these children's clothes?
- Yeah.

90
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,224
Nothing makes your titties pop
like a toddler top.

91
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,894
Does that say
"Daddy's Little Quarterback"?

92
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,270
I know. I love it.

93
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,105
I just wish they had one
in my size.

94
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,481
None of these are in your size.

95
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,816
Here you go.

96
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:16,154
I got a D? But I studied
for, like, 15 minutes.

97
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,906
Holy crap.
I got my first A.

98
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,158
Oh, I am so texting this
to my mom.

99
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,951
Gonna rub it in her face

100
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,453
for doubting me.

101
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,038
Wait, that's not your test.

102
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,041
Moriah Harris?

103
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,125
Who's that?

104
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,877
Uh, excuse me, Paul?

105
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,713
Sorry, I think you gave me
the wrong test.

106
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,357
I'm so sorry.
Must've mixed you two up.

107
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,424
My B.

108
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,512
Great job.

109
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,520
Who mixes up the names
Whitney and Moriah?

110
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,040
I know they're both legendary
pop divas,

111
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,900
but the similarity ends there,
bro.

112
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,318
Who are you guys talking about?

113
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,819
Our Biochem TA mixed me up

114
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,905
with the only other Black girl
in our class.

115
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,323
First of all, are you okay?

116
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,075
And it's important
that you know this...

117
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,493
You don't have to be.

118
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,370
Okay. It's annoying, yeah,

119
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,013
but I don't wanna
make it a whole thing.

120
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,807
Well, if that's your choice,
I fully support you.

121
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,209
But I also think
we can organize a rally.

122
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,020
Why don't you just
mention it to him next class?

123
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,939
No, if I did that,
it'd probably get all twisted,

124
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,381
and I'd become
the angry Black girl.

125
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,424
- Oh! What if you...
- Guys, okay,

126
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,235
we don't have to solve
subtle racism tonight.

127
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,096
Okay?
Let's just have fun.

128
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,973
If we can ever get inside!

129
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,474
I got this.

130
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,518
Hey, door guy!

131
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,481
Hell yeah!
Toddler tops.

132
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,567
It is very upsetting
that that worked.

133
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,027
Yeah.

134
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:50,707
Leight, don't answer this
if this is homophobic...

135
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,209
- Not off to a great start.
- Uh, of the three of us,

136
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,711
who are you most attracted to?

137
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,938
- Oh, my...
- Are you seriously

138
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,879
asking her to rank us?

139
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,172
Not in a bad way.

140
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,799
Just in terms
of physical hotness.

141
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,175
This is ridiculous.

142
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,611
- Thank you, Whit.
- Because obviously,

143
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,556
I'd be number one.
Ha!

144
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,307
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

145
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,351
I think she's laughing
at your overconfidence.

146
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,602
Leighton is way more into

147
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,187
my brand
of understated elegance.

148
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,605
Damn it,

149
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,315
I spilled tequila
on my children's shirt.

150
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,901
Okay, I am not engaging in this.

151
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,404
That said,
Bela would not be first.

152
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,072
Or second.
I'm top two!

153
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,323
Yeah, but I put out

154
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,700
Does that not factor in at all?

155
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,201
Look, no offense,
but none of you

156
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,287
are really my type.
What is your type?

157
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,707
My perfect woman
would probably be 5'6",

158
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,835
good style, preferably
from a major metropolitan city,

159
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,086
blonde...

160
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,088
I think you just
described yourself.

161
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,424
Mm, I did. I would be happy
with a me.

162
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,967
So of all the girls
in this suite,

163
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,052
you rank yourself first?

164
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,137
Oh, absolutely.

165
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,597
Well, okay, then.

166
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,098
You know, I would too.

167
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,266
She didn't hear me.

Eric, what are you doing here?

177
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,995
Did a frat guy hire you to fix
his computer or something?

178
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,625
Bela, for the last time, I am
not a member of the Geek Squad.

179
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,043
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

180
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,669
Uh, Bela, this is Dana.

181
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,855
How do you guys know each other?

182
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,130
She your cousin or something?

183
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,465
She's my date.

184
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,383
And I'm a new writer
on "The Catullan."

185
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,468
Oh, really?

186
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,929
So you're funny and pretty.

187
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,180
Love that for you.

188
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,741
Please, you are way prettier
than me.

189
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,475
I look like I was just
rescued from a well.

190
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,395
Oof, um, that was actually
pretty insensitive

191
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,482
to people who have lost family
members in well accidents.

196
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,720
I can't believe
he knows another girl.

197
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,621
Be honest, I'm hotter
than her, right?

198
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,331
Actually, don't be honest.
Just say yes.

199
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,416
Are you jealous?
I thought you and Eric

200
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,020
were both hooking up
with other people.

201
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,294
Yeah, but when I do it

202
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,004
it's fun and flirty
and feminist.

203
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,257
When he does it, it's offensive
to women everywhere.

Kimberly, are you in there?

208
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,682
Leighton, come in.

209
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,354
Did you have an accident?

210
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:19,897
No! I have to do

211
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,024
my hormone injections
at the same time every day,

212
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,027
and in hindsight, I maybe
shouldn't have chose 9:30 p.m.,

213
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,696
but can you please inject me?

214
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,674
- But why are you naked?
- I was wearing a jumpsuit,

215
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,324
so I had to
take the whole thing off.

216
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,927
- Where are your shoes?
- There was a rock in one.

217
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,428
It's a separate issue.
Can you please just

218
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:34,847
stick this just stick this
in my tummy?

219
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,390
Fine, fine, fine, fine,
fine, fine, fine.

220
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,891
Okay, but please stop
staying the word "tummy,"

221
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,059
all right,
you're an 18-year-old girl,

222
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,209
not Winnie the fucking Pooh.

223
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,460
Okay.

224
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,045
All right.

225
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,548
How'd you get so good at this?

226
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,216
I, um, had to do my mom's Botox

227
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,509
during the pandemic.

228
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,219
It was a challenging time
for us all.

229
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,930
Well, thank you.
You're a lifesaver.

230
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,098
Sure.

231
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,474
Um, but you don't like,
expect me

232
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,268
to do this, like,
every night, right?

233
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,477
No, of course not.

234
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,705
It's Theta's theme party week.

235
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,439
I would never ask that of you.

236
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,567

Perfect.

249
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:28,966
That is the last shot.
We are done.

Thank you so much.

Mm-hmm.

252
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,430
I felt so close to you
this week.

253
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,266
I don't say this enough,
but I love you.

254
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,476
You've said it many times.

255
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,353
The hormones must be working.

256
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,021
Hey, hotties.
Heads-up,

257
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,940
I left a lot of body glitter
in that shower.

258
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,667
- Oh, good to know.
- Um, are you still good

259
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,068
to drive me tomorrow?
Yeah.

260
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,070
It'll be you, me,
my mom's Ford Fiesta,

261
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,114
and to pass the time,
my favorite album,

262
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,283
voice recordings of me
singing Disney songs.

263
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,452
- Ah!
- Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.

264
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:59,413
Travis is driving you
to Boston for your procedure?

265
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,916
He's the only person I know
who has a car on campus.

266
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,543
- I will just take us.
- But you don't have a car.

267
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,379
Right, but I do have
a phone number

268
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,631
to a car service,
which is all we need.

269
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,258
Leighton, that's so nice.

270
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,760
Do car services have a dress
code I should be aware of?

271
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,141
Look at this dumb piece

272
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,685
that dumb bitch Dana wrote.

273
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,979
"12 Corporate Logos
That Look Like My Vagina."

274
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,689
Ugh, what a hack.

275
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,066
That literally sounds like
something you would write.

276
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,389
Sure, but I would've been able

277
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,860
to come up with at least 14.

278
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,780
And the presence of
an asymmetric carbon atom

279
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,824
can cause... anyone?

280
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,953
A chiral molecule.

281
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,539
Correct. Nice.

282
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,165
You were so smart today.

283
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:47,295
You were like, "Uh, it's
a spiral molecule. Bam!"

284
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,380
It's chiral, not spiral.

285
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,717
And, uh, bam!
She bams again.

286
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,885
Good job, today, Moriah.

287
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,890
Hey, you go ahead.
I'll catch you later.

288
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,857
Hey, Paul. Uh, so, my name
is actually Whitney.

289
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,358
- Ooh.
- Just wanted to make

290
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,711
that clear,
'cause you called me Moriah

291
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,486
a couple times, so...

292
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,947
I'm Whitney, she's Moriah.

293
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,534
All right?
We good?

294
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:21,287
Mm, mm-hmm.

295
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,290
Can I talk in private?

296
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,209
I promise you I am not a racist.

297
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,045
I didn't say you were, Paul.

298
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,408
Just trying to tell you my name.

299
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,108
- Please don't cry.
- Mixing you two up

300
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,010
was an honest mistake.
Okay, so-

301
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,321
- And I know what I'm doing now

302
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,804
is putting my trauma onto you,

303
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,181
so I am stopping.

304
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,850
But let me say
that I love Black people

305
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:46,354
and culture,
and I support Black businesses

306
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,772
whenever possible.

307
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,107
- Okay.
- You good? I feel good.

308
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,359
Hug it out?
Uh...

309
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:00,117
Leighton! Hold up!

310
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,370
Hold up.

311
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,246
- Do I know you?
- We're in an eight-person

312
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,414
math seminar twice a week.

313
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,916
My name's Jimin.

314
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,584
- And I'm Maurice.
- Right.

315
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,420
Um, it was so great to catch up.

316
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,172
Are you going to
the Hackathon today?

317
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,757
The... the what-a-what?

318
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,651
It's the math department's
craziest day of the year.

319
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:20,096
We spend 24 hours trying
to solve a PhD-level equation.

320
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,764
And some years, we do.

321
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,727
Well, we could really use
another smart person

322
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,102
on our team.

323
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,496
I really love the passion
you're showing

324
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,772
for this depressing event,
but...

325
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,107
sadly, I can't.

326
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,526
My roommate and I
are going out of town.

327
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,111
Also, for future notice,

328
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,239
I will not be joining any
math-based extracurriculars.

329
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,782
So...

330
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,676
Oh. We'll be livestreaming it
if you wanna tune in.

331
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,245
I... I am so sorry;
you are just out of earshot.

332
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,913
Yeah.
We'll be livestreaming it

333
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:49,458
if you wanna tune in.
Okay, amazing. Thank you!

334
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,050
- Hi, Eric.
- Hi.

335
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,428
Oh, hi, Dana.
Sorry, didn't see you there.

336
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,513
- How?
- Eric, can I steal you

337
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,140
for a sec?

338
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,933
I was actually just leaving.

339
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,560
I will see you later.

340
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,187
Bye, Dana!

341
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,357
So, uh, what's later?

342
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,860
Do you two have a board game
club or something?

343
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,212
We're going to that Theta party.

344
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,654
Oh, nice.

345
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,465
I'm going to that party
with someone else too.

346
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,574
Great.

347
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,577
Did my phone just buzz?

348
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,720
- I don't think so.
- Oh, it did.

349
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,288
It was him.

350
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,515
You can meet him at the party.

351
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,207
Sure.

352
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:33,961
Aaron!

353
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,171
Um... who are you?

354
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,839
Don't be ridiculous.

355
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,549
I'm Bela.

356
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,384
- Okay.
- Well, I'll be your date

357
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,594
to your party today.

358
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,887
- Did I ask you?
- You didn't.

359
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,430
I'll pick myself up at 4:00.

360
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,973
Bye!

361
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,559
The fuck?

362
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,872
Leighton, I honestly can't
thank you enough.

363
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,939
This is the fanciest car
I've ever been in.

364
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,318
I mean, look at these
gorgeous wooden trims.

365
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,401
I'm glad you like it.

366
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,362
Like it?
I love it!

367
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,198
I mean, there are seat heaters
in the back.

368
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,533
What is this?
Like, a moving spa?

369
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,368
Your parents have a car, right?

370
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,786
Yeah. We used to have two.

371
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,873
♪ 'Cause lately ♪

372
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,791
What are you doing?
Are you on some, like,

373
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,251
cool gay dating app?

374
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,378
No, I'm watching this
dumb math Hackathon.

375
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,297
You're watching math?
Like, for fun?

376
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,466
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I'm just letting it play

377
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,068
so that my teacher
knows that I'm watching.

378
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,304
I'm not, like,
paying attention or anything.

379
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,781
Oh, come on, Jimin!
How do you mess up

380
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:30,392
a problem like that?

381
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,061
- Leighton?
- Hm?

382
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,563
I think someone forgot
four water bottles in the back.

383
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,814
Should we tell the driver?

384
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,399
Kimberly, those are for us.

385
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,068
Holy shit!

386
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,445
I feel like a celebrity.

387
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,515
Do you need help?
You've been staring

388
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,082
at that form for, like,
ten minutes.

389
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,625
It says I can't sue them

390
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,669
if I die during the procedure.

391
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,003
I'm kinda freaking out.

392
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,130
I promise you are gonna be okay.

393
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,174
I've never been
put under before. Have you?

394
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,343
- Once.
- How was it?

395
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,469
- Bad.
- Oh!

396
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,971
I was hoping you'd say good.

397
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,973
I was 16,

398
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,534
and I was getting
my wisdom teeth removed.

399
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,768
- Oh.
- And the nurse told me

400
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,603
that people, like,
lose their inhibitions

401
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,730
and say all this
crazy shit to their family

402
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,233
and, like, their deep secrets
when they wake up.

403
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,610
So I spent the entire time
terrified

404
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,446
that I had accidentally
come out to my mom.

405
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,575
- But you didn't.
- No.

406
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,910
Although I did say
a lot of other crazy stuff

407
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,162
that Nico taped, and um,

408
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,622
I will be doing the same to you.

409
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,458
You're gonna be fine.

410
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,061
Thank you so much
for coming with me.

411
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,129
I would be so much more scared
if I were alone.

412
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,339
Oh, you could be worse
than alone.

413
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,591
You could be with Travis.

414
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,968
Well, I appreciate it.

415
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,472
I can't believe
I'm actually doing this.

416
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,974
Is this crazy?
It's crazy.

417
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,350
I... I'm fine. It's fine.

418
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,768
- Hang on.
- Mm-hmm.

419
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:55,978
Just...

420
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,064
Scoot.

421
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,149
Kimberly!

422
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,483
Oh, what's up, my girl?

423
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,068
Hey, guys!

424
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,754
Is it over?
Did you already have the baby?

425
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,381
- Oh, no, I'm not having...
- I'm kidding.

426
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,965
But you know what
I'm not kidding about?

427
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,783
You look hospital hot.
Oh, it's true!

428
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,868
You look good!

429
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,453
- Thank you.
- Okay.

430
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,097
All right, this is getting
way too sentimental,

431
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,456
so we gotta go.
Good luck!

432
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,749
I'm so proud of you!

433
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,042
- We love you!
- You got this!

434
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,918
Bye, love you!

435
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,547
All right.

436
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,798
You ready?

437
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,592

Hey. Um, Bela,
what's going on with your eyes?

Aren't they exotic? And look

We actually just got here.

We were at my apartment
watching a movie.

- Nice. Which movie?
- "Knives Out."

00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,846
Both: Yeah.

480
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,097
Ow, my eye!

481
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,324
- Are you okay?
- My straw hit it.

482
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,225
It's fine, I can still see.

483
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,828
But I do need to go
check in on a friend

484
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,769
who's doing a thing.

485
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,020
Aaron, are you coming?

486
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,105
Nah, I'm good.

487
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,945
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

488
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,572
Okay, can we have
a shit talk corner?

489
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,407
Ooh, you know that's
my favorite activity.

490
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,367
I'm actually majoring in it
right now.

491
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,454
So I had a really weird
run-in with one of my TAs.

492
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,955
Did you see him in shorts?

493
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,915
I hate seeing
an authority figure's knees.

494
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,917
No.
Uh, so he confused me

495
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,586
with the other Black girl
in our class,

496
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,755
and when I tried
to casually correct him,

497
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,006
he started crying.

498
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,674
He pulled the white tears card?

499
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,635
If I had a dollar
for every time that happened...

500
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,304
I'd only have 63 cents.

501
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,027
'Cause Black women make
significantly less

502
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:38,432
on the dollar.
The whole thing

503
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,642
was exhausting.
No cap, I was so naive

504
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,245
for thinking it'd be
different in college.

505
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,354
My freshman roommate
apologized to me

506
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,773
for going on a safari.

507
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,250
A white girl on my floor
once asked me

508
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,151
if I knew how
to cornrow her hair.

509
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,503
And, I mean,
I do know how to do it,

510
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,779
but you can't just ask me that.

511
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:52,988
I did mean to ask you,

512
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,174
can you do my hair on Saturday?

513
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,574
Oh, yeah, girl.
I got you.

514
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,801
What's annoying is, I'm the one

515
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,025
who's still thinking about it.

516
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,369
Like, now I have to feel bad

517
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,704
about upsetting him?

518
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,414
Preserving my chill
is my number one,

519
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,333
so personally,
I would ignore his ass.

520
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,836
Or you can switch places
with the other girl one day

521
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,380
and really mess with him.

522
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,591
I needed this.
I'm so glad I ran into y'all.

523
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,384
You could run into us a lot more

524
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,844
if you stopped by KJ.

525
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,568
I mean, I know there was drama
with Canaan

526
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,032
the last time you were there,
but that don't mean

527
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,474
you can't come through.

528
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,975
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

529
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,019
I will.
I will.

530
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:24,937
Both: Okay.

531
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,605
♪ Hey ♪

532
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,360
- ♪ I'm never not ♪
- ♪ Oh ♪

533
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,320
- Leighton.
- Hey!

534
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,072
You absolutely killed it!

535
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,740
The nurse said you did amazing.

536
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,534
They got, like,
28 eggs from you.

537
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,827
Is that good?

538
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,286
Based off a Google search I did

539
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,514
while you were drooling
in your sleep,

540
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,831
it's great.
Oh, yay.

541
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:44,914
I did it.

542
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,166
Hell yeah, you did!

543
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,544
Oh, Leighton,
can I tell you a secret?

544
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,462
- Okay.
- You're gay,

545
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,840
and I love you for it.

546
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,885
Welp, this is gonna be
a long car ride home.

547
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,562
Be outside, bitch!

548
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,606
Bela, it's me.

549
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,323
God, you look like
my family's Husky.

550
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,575
Ugh.

551
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,159
What is going on with you?

552
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,887
What is going on with you
and that wet-mouthed

553
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,496
trollop son of a bitch, Dana?

554
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,498
I think you might

555
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,083
be a little bit jealous of Dana.

556
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,419
No, I don't think so.

557
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,129
You can't have it
both ways, Bela.

558
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,357
You're clearly dangling
that dude's muscles in my face,

559
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,508
and you freak out the second
I'm with somebody else.

560
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,094
What do you want?
I don't know anymore.

561
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:40,947
I thought I wanted to be
a fun, non-monogamous

562
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,975
boss bitch, but now I think
I just wanna, like...

563
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,060
date you.

564
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,270
You do?

565
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,897
Yeah.

566
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,066
Okay. Let's do it.

567
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,365
Take your pants off.

568
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,926
I need you to take
that other contact out.

569
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,411
You have your heated blanket,

570
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,956
iPad, and your sad,
sad selection of snacks.

571
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,875
Oh, I forgot that I got raisins!

572
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,668
Tonight's gonna be lit.

573
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,588
What are you gonna do?
Hang here with you.

574
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:18,342
Solve for D
if the value of K is 4.

575
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,469
- 13?
- Sorry, that's wrong.

576
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:24,139
Jimin! How do you mess up
a simple differential equation?

577
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:25,641
- Leighton?
- Hmm?

578
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,393
I think you wish
you were at that Hackaton.

579
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,686
Are you kidding me?

580
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,272
No, I have no interest
in spending time

581
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,316
with those nerds.
But I think

582
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,859
you might be a nerd.

583
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,110
Excuse you.

584
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,322
What's 715 divided by 62?

585
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,491
- 11.53.
- Whoa!

586
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,825
Is that right?

587
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,136
I deleted the calculator app
on my phone,

588
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,536
and I can't get it back.

589
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,789
Look, I don't take math classes

590
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,124
because I'm some loser
who loves numbers.

591
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,669
I do it because
I am really good at it.

592
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:57,130
And I enjoy being better
at things than everyone else.

593
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,548
- Then go be good.
- No.

594
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,425
Even if I wanted to,
I am not gonna

595
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,509
leave you here tonight.

596
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,844
But I'm fine.

597
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,568
You don't have to worry about
me, I swear.

598
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,641
Go.

599
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,559
Okay, maybe I will just,
like, pop in

600
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,728
for just, like, a sec.

601
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,275
If anyone asks, I am at
an exclusive yacht party

602
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,654
in, um...
In whatever ocean's closest.

603
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,737
Okay.

604
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,537
I'm outie with Eric...

605
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,621
my boyfriend.

606
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,706
You got boyf'd?

607
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,082
Yeah, I got boyf'd so hard

608
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,500
in the bathroom
I can barely walk.

609
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,583
Horrible!

610
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,211
This is a dirty frat house.

611
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:37,713
Go have fun with your man.

612
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,424
I'm gonna stay for a bit.
Okay.

613
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,967
Okay, so Canaan just texted,

614
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,928
and he's on his way.
Ay! Finally.

615
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,265
Actually, I'ma head out too,

616
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,808
get something to eat before bed.

617
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,744
Hell, no! You are not
about to flee this party

618
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,895
because Canaan is coming,
we just talked about this.

619
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,499
Oh, my God.
That is not what this is.

620
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,649
I'm just tired.
Y'all need to chill.

621
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,360
See you later.

622
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,282
And according to one study

623
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,992
elderly friendships
serve a purpose

624
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,618
far beyond enjoyment.

625
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,580
They're also saving lives.

626
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,915
- Oh, that's fascinating.
- Tell me, how did your...

627
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,083
Life change

628
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,251
after you met Barney?

629
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,794
Ugh.
Well, I hug more now.

630
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,129
Oh, you love to hug?

631
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,214
I... I love to give hugs.

632
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:44,112
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

633
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,156
- Hey.
- Hi.

634
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,741
Staying in tonight?

635
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,202
Mm-hmm.

636
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,787
- Are you okay?
- Uh, yeah

637
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,289
I just had a little
medical procedure done today

638
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,582
and I'm not feeling well,

639
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,459
and now I'm locked out
of my suite,

640
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,920
and I left my phone in there.

641
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,297
Well, why don't we just
go wait in my room

642
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,007
until your friends get home?
No, no.

643
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,967
I'm fine. Go have fun.

644
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,719
I'm not going to
leave you like this.

645
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,930
It's all good. Come on.

646
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:14,184
All right.

647
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,322
I wasn't gonna let a pandemic

648
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:31,201
stop me from salsa dancing
with my friends.

649
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,994
- Kimberly?
- So you've been dancing

650
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,222
together over the internet?
Oh, we had the time

651
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,622
of our lives.

652
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:38,166
But then a new obstacle
developed.

653
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,002
Phillip's vision was failing.

654

655

Hey.

- Hey.
- Uh, what happened?

657
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,431
She got locked out
and wasn't feeling well.

658
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,267
And you just, like,
took care of her?

659
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,187
That's cool.
It's all good.

660
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,031
I've actually had to nurse
a lot of sickliens

661
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,566
back to health at home.

662
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,693
But she's a better patient.

663
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,736
A lot to unpack there.

664
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,922
Help me get her
back to our room?

665
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,239
Yeah, sure.

666
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,533
Kimber.

667
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,868

And yet I am changed.

675
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,310
Hello, Whitney.

676
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,246
There's actually something
I wanted to share with you.

677
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,731
I've been listening
to this illuminating podcast

678
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,441
on race relations in academia...

679
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,359
Ooh, look, Paul, uh,

680
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,361
I know you mean well,
and congrats

681
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,905
on doing the work,

682
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,282
but I don't want every
conversation we have together

683
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,868
to be about my Blackness
and your whiteness.

684
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,411
That is not our thing.

685
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,747
I want our thing to be
that you're my TA,

686
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,626
and I'm your student,
and you just get my name right.

687
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,128
Can we do that, Paul?

688
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,505
And oh, my God,
do not cry right now.

689
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,674
Okay, I really don't wanna
have to console you

690
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:10,759
about this again.

691
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,427
That should not be my job.

692
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,428
Right, yeah.

693
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,931
- We good?
- So good.

694
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,058
Thank you.

695
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:21,603
Hmm.

696
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,190
Hey, Moriah, I'm Whitney.

697
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:28,944
Oh, I know.

698
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,737
You crushed it, Leighton.

699
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,423
We never would've gotten
second without you.

700
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,615
Yes, that's correct.

701
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,617
We'll get first next time.

702
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,826
We?
Oh, okay,

703
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,454
if I do this again, I'm 100%

705
