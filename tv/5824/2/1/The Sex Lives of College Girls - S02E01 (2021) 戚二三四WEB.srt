1
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:19,436
听着 我知道这不是最好的感恩节之一
Look, I know it wasn't the best Thanksgiving,

2
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,688
但是尼克会没事的
but Nico is going to be fine.

3
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:24,691
是的 他是我的小宝贝
Yeah, he's my baby boy.

4
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,109
他都21岁了 爸
He's 21, Dad.

5
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,277
是啊 但是他挺敏感的
Yeah, but he's sensitive.

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,863
他不够坚强也没你那么体魄健壮
He's not tough and brawny like you.

7
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,781
-健壮？-听着 别担心我
- Brawny? - Look, don't worry about me

8
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:32,865
也别担心家里了
or this family.

9
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,951
你去好好玩 努力学习
You go have fun, study hard,

10
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,453
找个男朋友...
find a boyfriend...

11
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,288
像其他年轻人一样
Be young.

12
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,707
好吧 爱你
Okay. I love you.

13
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,375
你确定你现在的状态开车没事吗？
Are you sure you're good to drive?

14
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,461
我不确定 开开看吧
I don't know, we'll see.

15
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,254
我觉得可以的
I think so.

16
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,964
再见 宝贝
Goodbye, pumpkin.

17
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,303
这呢 拿着你的包
Here, hold your bag.

18
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,804
-我没事 卡罗尔 -好吧

19
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,639
哦天哪 惠特尼 你好啊
Oh, my God, Whitney, hi!

20
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,142
你感恩节过得怎么样？挺好的
How was your Thanksgiving? Really good.

21
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,019
等会儿 你们从亚利桑那州开车回这里的吗？
Wait, did you guys drive here from Arizona?

22
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,604
这路不是挺远的吗？
Isn't that a long trip?

23
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,939
是啊 39个小时呢 实际感觉起来更长
Yeah, it's 39 hours, and it felt like a lot more.

24
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:08,568
是啊 结果就是花了1500刀在加油和住宿上
Yup, it ended up costing $1,500 in gas and hotels.

25
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,862
我们还让一对夫妻狠狠吵了一架
And we got in a couple really bad arguments.

26
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,655
啊 那也改不了路途遥远的事实
Ah, wouldn't change a thing.

27
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,948
你好啊 嘿！
Hi! Hey.

28
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,575
哦 我的天哪 你家里怎么样
Oh, my goodness. How's your family?

29
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,535
-嗯 挺好的 我们领养了只狗 -噢
- Uh, good. We adopted a dog. - Ooh.

30
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,472
我妈觉得这有助于她的支持率
My mom thought it would help her approval ratings.

31
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,997
事实上没有 然后就把小狗退回去了
It did not. She returned it.

32
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,791
她真是个不得了的女人啊
She is an amazing woman.

33
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,250
我总在我朋友那替她说好话
I always defend her to my buddies.

34
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,794
-爸！-好吧 亲爱的
- Dad! - Well, honey,

35
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,521

36
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,005
-回亚利桑那州上班？-对啊
- In Arizona? - Yeah.

37
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,215
我们尽量路上不停下来了
We're gonna try not to stop.

38
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,508
-再见 亲爱的 -好的 再见
- Bye, sweetie. - Okay, bye.

39
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,842
-我们爱你哟 -开车注意安全

40
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,427
-爱你 -我爱你 亲爱的
- Love you. - I love you, pinochle.

41
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,348
坐了这么久的车 我现在就想好好休息一下
After that long drive, I just really wanna relax.

42
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,641
是啊
Yeah.

43
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,017
惠特尼！金伯莉！
Whitney! Kimberly!

44
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,644

46
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,646
诶 对不起
Uh, sorry,

47
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,939
你的衣服呢
where are your clothes?

48
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,690
我十五分钟前到这儿的
Got in about 15 minutes ago,

49
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,692
让自己舒服点 给自己弄了点小零食
got comfortable, made myself some snacks.

50
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,170
在家里我爸妈执着于
My parents were, like, obsessed with me

51
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,546
让我穿衣服 -噢 我同意你爸妈的
wearing clothes at home. - Oh, totally.

52
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,714
你坐上沙发前
Would you mind putting a towel down

53
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,864
能不能铺个毛巾毯
before you sit on the sofa?

54
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,033
-为什么？-因为你屁股光着
- Why?- Because of your butt.

55
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,328
-蕾登 嘿！-欢迎回来！
- Leighton, hey! - Welcome back!

56
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,831、
-嘿！-大家好啊
- Hey! - Hi, all.

57
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,041
我有个事情要宣布
I have an announcement.

58
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:06,268
你怎么穿着内衣
Why are you in your underwear?

59
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,752
这样舒服
For comfort.

60
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,588
哦 好吧 尼克被开除了
Okay, well, Nico got expelled.

61
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,881

62
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,383
-你是说真的？-对啊
- Are you serious? - Yeah.

63
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,152
金伯莉把偷来的考试文件上交的时候
When Kimberly turned in the stolen test files,

64
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,720
教务处就开始了一些列的调查
the administration started an investigation,

65
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,223
Theta兄弟会的一些高年级的成员被踢出去了
and a bunch of senior Thetas got kicked out.

66
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,642
高年级的？可是他们是最帅的一批人诶
The seniors? But they were the hottest ones.

67
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,102
那尼克打算怎么办
What's Nico gonna do?

68
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,937
这个嘛 谢天谢地 我爸能给康奈尔
Well, thankfully, my dad was able to make

69
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,107
捐一大笔钱 下学期给他在学校找个位置塞进去
a big donation to Cornell and got him a spot next semester.

70
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,901
而且他们为了让他高兴给他买了辆奥迪
And they got him an Audi to try and cheer him up.

71
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,112
行吧 这个故事一下子就没那么惨了
Mm-kay, this story is getting less sympathetic.

72
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,573
真是遗憾 你哥哥这么老帅
I'm so sorry. Your brother was gorgeous,

73
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,950
我会怀念在校园里看见他的脸和身材的日子
and I'm gonna miss seeing his face and body around campus.

74
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,535
谢谢你
Thank you.

75
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,079
你穿的是我的内衣吗？
Are you wearing my underwear?

76
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:45,498
就内衣啦...噢内裤也是你的！
Just the bra... oh! Bottoms too.

77
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,925
-金伯莉 -嗯？
- Kimberly. - Yeah?

78
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,945
你告诉你爸妈你的奖学金没了吗
Did you tell your parents about losing your scholarship?

79
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,697
噢 我还没找到合适的时机告诉他们
Oh, I couldn't find the right time to mention it to them.

80
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,801
什么意思？你跟他们待在车上39个小时诶
What do you mean? You were in the car for 39 hours.

81
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,534
就是啊 你不是需要很多很多的钱吗？
Yeah, don't you need, like, a lot of money?

82
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,603
噢 就每年42000刀啦...
Oh, just $42,000 per year...

83
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,479
加起来138000刀
$138,000 total.

84
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,773
真的假的？那可是 大概 四辆车了
Seriously? That's, like, four cars,

85
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,358
或者 大概 蕾登五个包的钱
or, like, five of Leighton's purses.

86
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,242
姐妹 我觉得你应该告诉你爸妈的
Dude, I think you need to tell your parents.

87
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,778
我开不了口 这比杀了他们还难受
I can't. It would kill them.

88
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,339
我得自己想个招
I need to figure out a solution on my own.

89
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,990
招儿来了
Solution's right here.

90
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,342
问这俩有钱人要点
Ask one of these two moneybags for it.

91
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,784
他们的父母很有钱
Their parents are loaded. Uh...

92
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,161
我是说 别指望我
I mean, don't look at me.

93
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,889
蕾登的家庭比我的有钱多了
Leighton's family's way richer than mine is.

94
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,789
我家是从政的有钱
We're politician rich.

95
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,791
那个 我家大部分的财富都跟
Well, most of my family's wealth is tied up

96
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,419
一些土地和赛马绑定在一起了
in real estate and, um, several racehorses.

97
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,712
噢 你俩不需要让你们的
Oh, you guys don't need

98
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,464
有钱家庭听起来很穷的样子
to make your rich families sound poor.

99
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,424
我不会要你们任何一个人的钱的
I would never ask either of you for money.

100
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,260
我自己走到这个境地的 我会把自己救出来的
I got myself into this, and I'll get myself out.

101
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,304
等等 我知道了 如果你需要额外的钱
Wait, I've got it. If you need extra money,

102
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,698
你可以去按网上卖一些玉足照片
you should sell feet pics on the dark web.

103
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,973
这真的是
That's certainly

104
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,767
一个有趣的主意 -金伯莉 不要
an interesting idea. - Kimberly, no.

105
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,311
你就去助学金办公室申请贷款
Just go to the financial aid office and apply for a loan.

106
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,438
别啊 我的计划更好 你脚指头很长
No! My plan is better. You've got long toes,

107
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,624
是真的有这方面的需求市场
and there's a real market for that.

108
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,649
-别说了！-贝拉！
- Stop! - Bela!

109
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,732
怎么了嘛？不要觉得我的好主意
What? Don't shame me

110
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,943
丢人啊
for my good ideas.

111
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,323
姐妹们 我们一直在说这个学校需要什么？
Guys, what are we always saying this campus needs?

112
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,550
-更好的Wi-Fi？-一个染眉毛
- Better Wi-Fi? - A decent place

113
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,659
的好去处？
to get my eyebrows tinted?

114
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,928
一个原住民的纪念碑
A memorial to Native peoples.

115
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,328
不是
No.

116
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,830
一本全女性的喜剧杂志
An all-female comedy magazine.

117
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,123
我跟一些朋友
I'm starting one

118
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,207
正在合办一本
with some friends.

119
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,352
我们一次性推翻一个
We're toppling the patriarchy

120
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,835
排名前十的男权问题
one top-ten list at a time.

121
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,796
杂志 嗯 还在流行吗？
Are magazines, like, a thing anymore?

122
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,815
这个嘛 至少我们的杂志可以成为Instagram上的新风尚
Well, ours would mostly be an Instagram presence,

123
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,675
Twitter上的时髦话题 以及一个
a sassy Twitter account, and a website

124
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,235
由我们主导的新兴领域网站
that we haven't bought the domain for yet.

125
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,803
这会是个大事的 多酷啊
It's gonna be huge. That's so cool.

126
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,554
-是的 -贝拉 我不得不说
- Yeah. - Bela, I have to say,

127
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,014
目前来看 我支持你
so far, I support this.

128
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,349
对吧 
Yeah.

129
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,810
-他爹的怎么回事儿？-噢 我的天哪 你还好吗？
- What the fuck? - Oh, my God, are you okay?

130
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,853
是谁用牛奶盒砸我啊？
Did somebody just hit me with a milk carton?

131
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,730
噢 天哪 你刚刚被击中了
Oh, man. You just got nailed.

132
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,148
是啊 这也太糟糕了
Yeah, that was so fucked up.

133
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,858
-就是啊 可不么 -这一定很让你
- Yeah, I know. - That must have been

134
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,026
意外吧
really surprising.

135
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,861
嗯 对啊 当然了
Um, yeah, it was.

136
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,114
所以即使你什么都没做错
So even though you didn't do anything wrong,

137
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,740
坏事还是会找上门？
something bad still happened to you?

138
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,367
你干嘛这样说话？
Why are you talking like that?

139
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,761
就是啊 听起来跟个寓言故事的开头一样
Yeah, it sounds like the beginning of a parable.

140
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,078
因为我们他爹的在Theta兄弟会
'Cause we're in fucking Theta,

141
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,330
你们几个人让我们的特许状被暂停使用了
and you guys got our charter suspended.

142
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,599
等等 这就是原因？
Wait, is that what this is about,

143
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,874
考试那件傻事儿？
the stupid test thing?

144
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,793
对 你们抓住我们了 你们这些警察
Yeah, you narced on us, you narcs.

145
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,545
就因为你们的愚蠢行为 我们可惨了
That stunt you pulled fucked us.

146
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,921
我们再也不能办派对了
We can't throw parties anymore.

147
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,424
所以你就他爹的朝我扔牛奶？
So you threw a fucking milk at me?

148
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,051
-这件毛衣800刀呢！-什么？
- This sweater cost $800! - What?

149
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,612
是你们这些蠢货考试作弊
You dickheads were the ones cheating.

150
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,916
我们只是检举揭发了
We were just the whistleblowers.

151
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,264
就是啊 而且根本不是我干的
Yeah, and I didn't even do it.

152
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,557
好吗？是她啊
All right? It was her.

153
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,183
我大概是要为这事儿负责的
I am kind of responsible for that.

154
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,853
我知道 我本来就打算砸你的 跑偏了
I know. I meant to hit you, but my aim was off.

155
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,479
这不重要 从现在起
It doesn't matter. From now on,

156
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,065
你们谁都别想再踏进Theta兄弟会半步
none of you are ever setting foot in Theta again.

157
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,777
他把我橘子拿走了
He took my clementine.

158
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,074
我真抱歉发生了这样的事
I'm so sorry that happened to you.

159
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,201
嗯 我都习惯了 我跟我妈在各个剧院外面
Eh, I'm used to it. My mom and I have gotten

160
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,120
被扔了血袋
blood thrown on us outside multiple operas.

161
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:32,165
大家 我还是不敢相信我们不能再去Theta兄弟会的派对了
Guys, I can't believe we can't party at Theta anymore.

162
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,541
谁管他们啊？
Who cares about Theta?

163
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,251
他们都不能再办派对了
They can't even throw parties anymore.

164
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:38,129
我们再找个兄弟会一起玩就好了
We'll just find a new frat to hang with.

165
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,006
噢 我的天哪
Oh, my God.

166
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,507
-什么？-看啊
- What? - Look.

167
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,273
姑娘们 记得别在走廊上聚集
Girls, remember not to congregate in the hallways.

168
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:58,733
会有消防风险
It is a fire hazard.

169
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,402
这些老旧建筑就跟个火种盒一样 所以...
These old buildings are tinder boxes, so...

170
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,988
-谢谢 弗路德 -宿舍师友会上见
- Thanks, Frude. - See you at the FAF meeting.

171
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,160
欢迎回来 我的新生们
Welcome back, my Fresh-Them.

172
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,788
希望你们美国感恩节过得愉快
I hope you enjoyed American Thanksgiving,

173
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,040
你们没什么人转学真让我松了口气
and I'm relieved so few of you transferred.

174
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,292
我确实有好消息要告诉你们
I do have exciting news.

175
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,586
我们有个新成员
We have a new student joining us,

176
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,963
他是个气候难民
and he is climate refugee.

177
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,799
哇 我觉得能接收
Wow, I think it's great

178
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,717
背井离乡的人很棒诶
that we're taking in a displaced person.

179
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,552
是啊 他们是来自发展中国家吗
Yeah, are they from a developing nation?

180
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,554
不 他从堪萨斯州来的
No, he's from Kansas.

181
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,056
啊 现在他来了
Ah, here he is now.

182
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,809
大家 请给我们的气候难民
Everyone, please give a warm welcome

183
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,479
杰克逊一个热烈的欢迎
to our climate refugee, Jackson.

184
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,480
-大家好 -等等
- Hello. - Wait,

185
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,815
你就是那个气候难民？
you're the climate refugee?

186
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,024
-可你是白人诶 -贝拉
- You're white. - Bela.

187
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,151
-怎么了嘛？-亲爱的 嗯
- What the hell? - Sweetheart, um,

188
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,861
告诉大家发生了什么
tell us what happened to you,

189
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,780
还有你是不是直男啊 是单身吗
and if you're straight and single.

190
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,116
我真的不知道怎么去讲述这件事
I really don't know how else to say it.

191
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,993
我的大学宿舍被一阵四级龙卷风吹走了
My college dorm was blown away by a Category 4 tornado.

192
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,161
天哪
Shit.

193
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,412
-哇 -等等 你说什么？
- Wow. - Wait, what?

194
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,289
那太糟糕了 但是弗路德
That's terrible. But Frude,

195
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,999
我觉得“难民”这个词更多
I think the term "refugee" implies

196
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,584
指的是国际上的逃难
more of an international displacement.

197
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,212
嗯 金伯莉 别冒犯我的新朋友
Uh, Kimberly, do not offend my new friend.

198
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,588
他已经够不容易了
He's been through enough.

199
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,590
我觉得气候变化是真的
I think climate change is real.

200
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,926
-就是啊 你认真的吗？-我没说是假的啊
- Yeah, are you serious? - I didn't say it wasn't.

201
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,886
说起气候变化
And speaking of climate change,

202
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,514
天气预报说明天会下雪
tomorrow's forecast calls for snow,

203
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:15,852
这说明艾塞克斯最没有种族歧视的传统要来了
which brings with it Essex's oldest non-racist tradition,

204
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,562
年度雪季赛跑
The Annual Snow Run.

205
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,188
哦 我的天哪
Oh, my God!

206
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,232
是那个穿着内衣在雪里奔跑的活动吗？
Is that where we run in the snow in our underwear?

207
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,692
就是那个
That is correct.

208
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,253
我们要提前开始吗 还是等到开赛？
Should we pregame or wait till we get there?

209
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,778
哦 我们肯定要提前开始
Oh, we should absolutely pregame.

210
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,488
我们宿舍的酒可好太多了
The booze in our dorm is way better.

211
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:31,325
提醒一下 未成年喝酒是不合法的也不好玩
Reminder, underage drinking is illegal and not fun.

212
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,870
我们下一个吸引人的话题才真正好玩...
But what is fun is our next juicy topic...

213
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,955
避免季节性抑郁
Avoiding seasonal depression.

214
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,503
嘿 金伯莉
Hey, Kimberly.

215
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,966
嘿 你是不是给我买了个同性恋彩虹气球柱
Hey, did you buy me a column of gay pride balloons?

216
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,342
哦 我的天 我买了
Oh, my God. I did.

217
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,969
真对不起
I'm so sorry.

218
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,889
我以为你会在休息期间告诉惠特尼和贝拉
I assumed you told Whitney and Bela over break,

219
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,100
但是你没说 我也取消不了订单了
but then you didn't, and I couldn't cancel them.

220
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,393
有其他人看见吗？
Did anyone else see them?

221
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:59,687
我让你跟大家出柜了吗？我是个糟糕的盟友吗？
Have I outed you? Am I bad ally?

222
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,439
不 你没事的
No, you're fine.

223
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,002
我就是很困扰
I'm just disturbed that you think I am

224
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,359
你以为我是那种喜欢这些东西的同性恋
the kind of gay person who would like that.

225
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,403
了解 你和惠特尼和贝拉出柜的时候
Got it. When you come out to Whitney and Bela,

226
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,030
我会给你买个普通一定的气球塔
I'll get you a classier balloon tower.

227
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,574
我的出柜计划不包括气球啦
My ideal coming-out does not involve balloons.

228
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,242
完全不要 求你了
No balloons at all, please.

229
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,869
你要跟贝拉和惠特尼说吗？
Are you gonna tell Bela and Whitney?

230
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:18,789
也许有一天会 但不是现在
At some point, probably, but not right now.

231
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,083
好 我与你同在
Well, I'm here for you.

232
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,711
好的 我得去助学金办公室
Okay, I gotta go to the financial aid office

233
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,921
去申请贷款了
to ask for a loan.

234
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,172
祝我好运吧
Wish me luck.

235
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,257
等等 你打算穿着你工作制服去？
Wait, wearing your Sips uniform?

236
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,092
对啊 我想让他们知道我有工作
Yeah, I want them to know I have a job.

237
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,510
挺聪明的 对吧？
It's pretty smart, right?

238
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,846
金伯莉 银行只会把钱给看起来
Kimberly, banks only give money to people

239
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,099
本来就很有钱的人
who look like they already have money.

240
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,183
我来帮你
Let me help you.

241
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,195
-金伯莉·芬克尔？-这儿呢
- Kimberly Finkle? - Here.

242
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,033
我超期待比赛淡季的
I'm so psyched for the off-season.

243
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,719
我被足球打中好几次了
I got hit with a soccer ball so many times,

244
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,620
我都觉得我的乳头得了慢性脑创伤了
I think my titties got CTE.

245
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,830
那我们闲下来要做什么啊？
So what are we gonna do with all our free time?

246
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,165
我觉得可以一觉睡到三点
I'm thinking sleeping till 3:00

247
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,729
然后喝酒喝到下一个三点
and then drinking till the other 3:00.

248
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,632
嗯 那不适合我 我的行程可满了
Mm, that's a no for me. My schedule's packed.

249
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,254
已经满了？现在？
Already? How?

250
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,773
比赛淡季就是要做平时练习期间
Off-season is when we do all the stuff

251
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,131
所有我们不能做的事
we can't do during soccer.

252
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,716
我在竞选学生政府
I'm running for student government.

253
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,802
你看见这些失败者了吗？我得打败他们
Have you seen those losers? I'm gon' clean up.

254
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,387
你为什么竞选啊？
Why would you wanna do that?

255
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,347
宝贝 那是给毕业简历上增光添彩
Pad that grad school résumé, babe.

256
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,724
是啊 我已经有篮球项目了 我已经是两赛季的运动员了
Yeah, I've got basketball. I'm a two-season athlete.

257
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,601
但是你刚刚说睡觉喝酒
But you were just joking about sleeping

258
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,311
一整天都是开玩笑的对吧？
and drinking all day, right?

259
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,314
是啊 当然了 肯定是开玩笑的
Yes, duh, totally.

260
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,025
我有很多事要去做呢 咱走吧
I've got so much going on. Let's go.

261
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:36,033
这个 芬克尔小姐
Well, Ms. Finkle,

262
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,803
我们可以给你批贷款了
I think we're gonna be able to get you this loan.

263
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,162
哦 天哪 真的吗？ 真让人松了口气
Oh, my God, really? That's such a relief.

264
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,999
我乐意帮忙 你 嗯 有其他问题吗？
I'm happy to help. Do you, uh, have any questions?

265
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,417
-没有 -有问题的 其实
- No. - Actually, yes.

266
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,961
贷款什么时候开始积累利息
When does the loan start accruing interest,

267
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,754
利息是固定的还是变化的呢？
and is it fixed or variable?

268
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,172
好问题
Great questions.

269
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,717
我把这个手册给你好了
Let me just get you this pamphlet.

270
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,968
哦 哇
Oh, wow.

271
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,845
这上面每个人看起来都好开心哦
Everyone in here looks so happy.

272
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,221
金伯莉 这些人就是平面模特而已
Kimberly, they're print models.

273
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,015
我已经在一个节育环广告上看见过这个女生了
I've seen that girl in a NuvaRing ad.

274
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,600
你可以带我们再过一遍还款流程吗？
Can you at least walk us through the payback structure?

275
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,603
嗯 好的 根据你的贷款数目
Uh, well, with a loan your size,

276
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,357
未来三十年 每个月你要还款900刀
you'd be paying about $900 a month for the next 30 years.

277
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,110
不过有自动还款 你都不会意识到
But with autopay, it's like you don't even know

278
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,862
钱从你的账户上被划走了
the money's leaving your account.

279
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,048
你一直到 大概 五十岁才会把钱还完
You're gonna be paying this back until you're, like, 50.

280
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:18,951
哦 完成还款的平均年龄实际上会在你快七十岁的时候
Oh, the payoff age is actually late-60s on average.

281
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,620
我都没有别的选择
I don't have any other options.

282
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,414
我想要借这笔贷款
I'd like to go ahead with the loan.

283
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,167
好极了 让我们把钱给你吧
Wonderful, let's get you that shmoney.

284
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,668
我只要把纸质文件拿来
I'm just gonna go grab the paperwork

285
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,211
给你父母共同签署就行
for your parents to cosign.

286
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,713
不要！
No!

287
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,966
我是说 如果不能给我父母签呢
I mean, what if that's not an option?

288
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,804
很抱歉 但是有共同签署人这件事没得商量
I'm sorry, but a cosigner is kind of a non-negotiable.

289
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,516
哦 那我想我办不了贷款了
Oh, then I don't think I can do this.

290
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,976
谢谢你花时间招待
Thanks for your time.

291
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,898
欢迎各位来自艾塞克斯搞笑女们
Welcome, funny ladies of Essex.

292
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,067
我们很荣幸邀请到大家参加
We're so happy you're interested in joining

293
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,946
我们学校有史以来第一本全女性搞笑杂志
our school's first ever, female-only comedy magazine.

294
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,741
我知道你们在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

295
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,452
没有一些男人抄袭柯南秀和周六夜现场
Will it be hard to do this without a bunch of guys

296
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:04,288
的创意 这件事会不会很难办呢？
who steal all their ideas from Conan and "SNL"?

297
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,831
不 不会的
No, it will not.

298
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,124
只要你在这间屋子里
If you're in this room,

299
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,751
就意味着你已经是我们的一份子了...
it means you're part of the movement...

300
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,834
除了那个看起来像在写作业的家伙
Except for that guy, who's doing homework, I think.

301
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,255
我们还在努力找个永久会议室
We're still working on finding a permanent meeting space.

302
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,966
我们迫不及待要读你们的投稿了
We're so excited to read your submissions.

303
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,927
未来几天
In a few short days,

304
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,804
你们中将会产生幸运女孩来加入我们
some of you lucky ladies will be joining us

305
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,889
撰写我们开创性第一版
in writing our groundbreaking first edition

306
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,433
成为我们搞笑姐妹原始成员
as one of our newfound comedy sisters.

307
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,522
我的天 这些女孩完全是群无聊的狗屎
Holy shit, these girls are unfunny turds.

308
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,357
是好事？
In a good way?

309
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,983
这怎么会是好事啊？
How would that be in a good way?

310
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,652
贝拉 你反应过渡了
Bela, you're overreacting.

311
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,697
有些...还可以吧 你读过这些了吗？
Some are... fine. Have you read these?

312
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,615
这个女生写了一首跟腹腔疾病有关的诗
This girl wrote a poem about celiac disease,

313
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:42,952
这个女生写了一个叫“OBGY-LOL”的词组
and this girl wrote a phrase called "OBGY-LOL."

314
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,871
-这到底什么意思？-所以他们还有的要学呢
- What does that even mean? - So they have a lot to learn.

315
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,165
-我们可以教他们 -我真的希望他们能写出来
- We'll teach them. - I really need this to work.

316
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,917
我希望和搞笑的作者合作
I wanna write with writers that are funny,

317
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,335
像你跟乔一样
like you and Jo.

318
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,212
-还有我 -当然当然
- And me. - Sure.

319
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,023
听着 我们从一开始就不觉得能马上
Look, none of us thought we were gonna find

320
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,591
找到一大堆很不错又很搞笑的人
a bunch of amazing and hilarious people right away.

321
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,885
耐心点好吗？
Just be patient, okay?

322
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,053
好吧
Okay.

323
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,474
真遗憾你的助学贷款没申请下来 金伯莉
Sorry about your loan, Kimberly.

324
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,838
如果能让你高兴一点的话
If it makes you feel any better,

325
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,644
我的杂志这边也是一塌糊涂
my new comedy magazine's a disaster.

326
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:09,854
真的吗？为什么？
Really? Why?

327
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,313
因为她们超烂的
Because they all stink.

328
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,041
我猜《卡图兰》1994年以前不让女性
I'm worried "The Catullan" was onto something

329
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,984
加入肯定是有原因的
not letting women join until 1994.

330
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,610
听着 虽然我对
Look, I don't know anything

331
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,028
喜剧一点都不了解...-太对了
about comedy... - So true.

332
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,363
非常正确
So, so true.

333
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,167
但是也许你在做这些事之前
But maybe, before you throw this all away,

334
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,801
你应该找个之前这么干过的人聊聊
you should talk to someone who's done it before.

335
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,160
这听起来确实是个不错的主意
That does seem like good advice.

336
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,661
噢 这样的话 我有些不错的消息
Ooh, well, I have some cool news.

337
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,144
我打算加入水球队了
I'm gonna be on the water polo team.

338
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,372
-真的吗？-什么？
- Really? - What?

339
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,999
我都不知道你还会打水球呢
I didn't know you played water polo.

340
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,042
哦 我现在还不会...但是看起来挺简单的
Oh, I don't... yet. But it seems easy.

341
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,502
我看过水球视频
Based off a video I watched,

342
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,938
感觉就像在水里用手踢足球
I think it's just pool soccer with hands.

343
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,130
这样我们还可以跟
And then we can hang out

344
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,506
打水球的男生一起玩
with the water polo guys.

345
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,550
你知道吗 也许日子确实还是有盼头的
You know, maybe things are looking up.

346
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,260
噢 我的胸！
Ow, my boob!

347
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,679
他爹的怎么了？
What the fuck?

348
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,681
真对不起啊 不过不是真心的
Sorry. Not really, though.

349
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,394
现在这是垃圾了 你们这些垃圾
Now it's trash, you trash.

350
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,687
穿点衣服吧
Put your clothes on.

351
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,900
噢 操 我得给我的胸冰敷一下
Aw, fuck. I gotta ice my boob.

352
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,402
等等 这是什么？
Wait, what is that?

353
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,490
你们听见了吗？
Did you guys hear that?

354
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,701
噢我的天哪
Oh, my God.

355
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:06,994
做爱的声音！
Sex noises!

356
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,305
等等 是那个气候难民
Wait, that's the climate refugee.

357
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,455
是他的房间
That's his room.

358
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,208
想知道那个女生是谁
Wonder who she is.

359
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,186
这个 管她是谁 这可是她人生大事
Well, whoever she is, she's having the time of her life.

360
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,128
他们声儿也太大了
They are being so loud.

361
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,898
这就是噪音污染啊 我得敲敲门
It's literal noise pollution. I'm gonna knock.

362
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,215
你敢！
Don't you dare!

363
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,698
让我先录点下来
Just let me record a little first.

364
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,185
贝拉？现在是早上8:15分
Bela? It's 8:15 in the morning.

365
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,604
-你怎么会在这儿？-有急事儿
- Why are you here? - It's urgent.

366
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,397
你怎么找到我家的？
How did you find my apartment?

367
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,900
我故意不告诉你在哪的
It was a very conscious choice to not tell you where it was.

368
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,735
听着 我的新杂志一团糟
Look, my new magazine is a disaster.

369
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,904
所有投稿人都糟透了 所以我打算
All the applicants suck, which is why I've decided

370
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,747
马上就放弃 接受我之前在
to immediately give up and accept my old spot

371
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,366
《卡图兰》的工作 贝拉回来了
on "The Catullan." Bela's back.

372
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,575
不客气
You're welcome.

373
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,869
嗯 不要
Um, no.

374
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,931
没人想要跟一个离开还要带走
I don't think anyone's gonna be excited to work with a girl

375
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,748
我们得力战将对女生继续合作
who left and stole all of our good writers.

376
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,875
他们是自愿离开的 《卡兰图》糟透了
They left willingly. "The Catullan" sucked.

377
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,520
你刚还说想回来
You just said you wanted to come back to it.

378
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,879
那好吧 你愿意来我的杂志干吗？
Fine then. Will you join my magazine?

379
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,007
我要说什么你才能离开我家？
What can I say that will help you leave my apartment?

380
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,593
我该怎么办？
What do I do?

381
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,137
嗯 好吧
Um, okay,

382
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,306
你打算建立一个团队对吧？
so you're building a team, right?

383
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,892
你应该把这件事认为是你的勒布朗时刻
So you gotta look at this as your LeBron moment.

384
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,812
这是你组成一个超级搞笑团队的机会
This is your chance to put together a super comedy lineup.

385
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,355
对吧？就像 勒布朗不会等着人来
Right? Like, LeBron didn't just wait

386
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,731
加入队伍
for people to come join the team.

387
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,899
他走出去了 然后他找到了
He went out, and he found

388
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,043
德韦恩·韦德和克里斯·波什
Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.

389
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,944
哦哦 了解了
Uh-huh, got it.

390
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,779
你可以不用体育术语再解释一遍么？
Can you put that in not sports terms?

391
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:26,282
就是去找一堆搞笑的人
Just find a bunch of funny people.

392
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,616
好的
Cool.

393
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,165
早上好 女士们
Good morning, ladies.

394
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,959
欢迎来到水球能力考核
Welcome to water polo tryouts.

395
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,545
我们将分组比赛来评估你们的技能水平
We're gonna do a scrimmage so I can assess your skill level.

396
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,921
听起来挺有趣
This seems fun.

397
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,464
你之前玩过水球吗？
You ever played water polo before?

398
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,800
玩过 我打比赛八年了
Yup, I played competitively for eight years.

399
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:47,011
这样啊 我刚开始 但是我敢保证
Yeah, I just started, but I'm pretty sure

400
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,554
这项运动也会在我人生轨迹上了
it's gonna be my life now too.

401
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,639
哦 对了 我快速地问一下 规则是什么？
Ooh, also, real quick, what are the rules?

402
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,141
冲 冲 冲 冲 开始了！
Up, up, up, up! Let's go!

403
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,535
女孩们快来 快下水！
Come on, ladies! Get in the water!

404
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,685
就是这样 这就对了！
Here we go, yes!

405
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,355
好了 开始 传球！
All right, let's go. Pass it!

406
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,442
为什么你们的手臂不用来游泳？
How are you guys not using your arms to swim right now?

407
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,027
加油 你们能行的！
Come on, you got this!

408
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,404
我再问一下我是哪个对的来着？
Which team am I on again?

409
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,697
开始！快快快！
Let's go! Quickly!

410
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,991
我 让我接！我空着...
Me, I got it! I'm open...

411
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,120
传球！高点儿！
Transition! High!

412
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,415
我空着呢！我可以接...
I'm open! I'm ope...

413
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,840
你被打昏了 不过我给你做人工呼吸了
You got knocked out, but I gave you mouth-to-mouth.

414
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:26,800
谢谢了
Thanks.

415
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,594
我觉得我现在知道怎么玩了
I think I get the rules now.

416
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,179
我应该再回去打比赛吗？
Should I jump back in?

417
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,262
不用了
No.

418
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,106
-你的助学贷款怎么样了？-说实话不咋地
- So how'd it go with the loan? - Honestly, not great.

419
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,442
他们说我得找我父母共同签署贷款
They said they need my parents to cosign my loan,

420
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,319
我也不能告诉他们发生了什么
and I can't tell them what happened.

421
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,297
-那你打算怎么办？-噢 我有个主意
- So what are you gonna do? - Ooh, I have an idea.

422
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,823
我表妹被公交车撞了之后赔了不少钱
My cousin got a bunch of money when she was hit by a city bus.

423
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,742
你也去撞一下 -事实上 我
Do that. - Actually, I found

424
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:55,037
另外一个超高薪的工作 可以在宿舍做的
a super high-paying second job I can do from my dorm room.

425
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,872
我给一个名叫《性爱天堂：澳大利亚》
I'm typing up the closed captioning

426
00:15:56,955 --> 00:16:00,376
的真人秀打上字母
for a reality show called "Sex Paradise: Australia."

427
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,461
-这也叫工作？-当然啊
- That's a job? - It sure is.

428
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,088
我要做的就是看一集
All I have to do is watch an episode,

429
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,715
仔细听 然后把他们说的话
listen very closely, and type up what they're saying...

430
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,485
还有他们在欢乐小屋里弄出的噪音打到字幕上就行
And the noises they make in the Pleasure Hut...

431
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:12,012
他爹的二十块一个小时呢 -好恶心啊
For 20 freakin' bucks an hour. - That's disgusting.

432
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,736
他们要付你几集的钱啊？
How many episodes are they paying you for?

433
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,349
一季三百集
It's 300 episodes a season.

434
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,017
如果我一个星期能找到至少
So if I can find time to transcribe

435
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,895
五十个小时去打字幕 加上我在学校的工作和
for at least 50 hours a week, on top of my school work

436
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:23,065
在这里的工作 我的经济问题就完美解决了
and my Sips job, my finances will be totally taken care of.

437
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,483
那时间也太长了
That's too much.

438
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,086
你应该直接把事儿跟你妈说了
You should just tell your mom what happened

439
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,277
然后让她跟你一起签贷款合同
and have her cosign a loan.

440
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,071
不要 我打算按我的计划行事
No, I'm gonna go with my thing.

441
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,280
好吧
Okay.

442
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,701
我也没有别的兴趣了
I don't have any other interests.

443
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:38,038
这样 你说什么才是我的王牌 除了足球？
Okay, what would you say is my thing, besides soccer?

444
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,998
你很酷
That you're cool.

445
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,751
你很漂亮
And you're pretty.

446
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,295
你可以唱卡拉OK 但是唱的一般
And you can kind of sing karaoke, but not really.

447
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,755
说真的 迦南
Seriously, Canaan.

448
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,507
我都不知道发生了什么
I don't get what's going on.

449
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,385
我想我有点迷茫
I guess I'm feeling... lost.

450
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:55,556
好吧 这样的话 你以后想做什么过活？
Okay, well, what do you wanna do with your life?

451
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,142
我不知道 你呢？
I don't know. What about you?

452
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,436
事实上 我有个非常详细的十年计划
Well, I actually have a very detailed ten-year plan

453
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,839
引领我建立自己的避险基金
that will hopefully lead me into starting my own hedge fund

454
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,606
用来帮助巨额投资的
that focuses on impact investing.

455
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,875
所以我基本上相当于在帮人的同时
So I'll basically be helping people

456
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,192
变得越来越富有
while getting very, very rich.

457
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,795
这就是我要说的啊
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

458
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,779
我感觉我是大学里唯一一个
I feel like I'm the only person in college

459
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,866
不知道自己的未来何去何从的人
who doesn't have their whole life already figured out.

460
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,784
感觉挺糟糕的
It kind of sucks.

461
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,121
这个嘛 我知道你迟早会弄清楚的
Well, I know you're gonna figure it out,

462
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,332
因为你很聪明啊 而且不管你用心做什么
because you're smart, and whatever you put your mind to,

463
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,334
你都会成功拿下的
you're gonna kill it.

464
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,129
-谢谢你 -除了玩水球
- Thank you. - Unless it's water polo.

465
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,882
我就知道你要这么说
I knew you were gonna do that.

466
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,137
哦 我的天 你们大家
Oh, my God, you guys.

467
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,681
好 现在已经有这么多雪了
Okay, there is so much snow already.

468
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,016
这真的安全吗？
Are we sure this is safe?

469
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,268
像是 我们的胸会被冻伤吗？
Like, do people get boob frostbite?

470
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,146
我想应该不会吧 但是值得查一下
I don't think so, but it's definitely worth a Google.

471
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,149
行了 既然这个雪中赛跑终点在兄弟会大街
Okay, so the snow run ends at Frat Row,

472
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,085
所有的兄弟会都会在那办大派对
where all the frats will be hosting big parties,

473
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,402
既然Theta出局了
and since Theta's out,

474
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,279
我做了详细的Instagram追踪
I did some comprehensive Instagram stalking

475
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,156
来找出下一个最佳选项
to figure out the next best option,

476
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,200
就决定是Omega Pi了
and it is definitely Omega Pi.

477
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,643
不管谁去看都知道他们
Their guys are for sure the hottest

478
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,053
的成员是最帅的 -这就是我
if anyone wants to check. - Is that why

479
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:00,621
打印机没墨的原因吗？-都2022年了
my printer is out of ink? - It's 2022.

480
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,390
你为什么还有个打印机？这都怪你
Why do you even have a printer? This is on you.

481
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,333
我刚刚说的 Omega Pi将要举办
As I was saying, Omega Pi's hosting

482
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,959
一个盛大的冬季陆上派对
a huge Winter Under land party.

483
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,795
这会是个公开活动 我们都要去
It is gonna be lit, and we're all going.

484
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,923
我不去了 我得在家做我的打字幕工作
Not me. I have to stay home and do some closed captioning.

485
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,841
-你确定吗？-是啊
- Are you sure? - Yeah.

486
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,177
我觉得这近期都是我的常态了
I think this is gonna be my new normal for a while.

487
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,013
好吧 姐妹们 我们几个去
All right. We gotta go, ladies.

488
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:19,657
好的 好的 等等等 我能说
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait. Can I just say

489
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,534
我们三个现在看起来都太他爹的性感了吗
that all three of us look so fucking hot right now

490
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,918
这会是我们人生中最棒的一天
and that this is gonna be one of the best days of our lives!

491
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,688
哦 我的天哪！
Oh, my God!

492
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,441
啊 我的 喔 喔！
Ah, my-ow, ow!

493
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,984
贝拉 贝拉 停下 停下
Bela, Bela, stop, stop.

494
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,111
起来！起来！
Get up! Get up!

495
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,530
杰西卡刚刚
Jessica has just made

496
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,448
做了一个残忍的决定
the bloody agonizing decision

497
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,950
她要甩了布莱克斯顿
to dump Braxton,

498
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,702
现在她要自己面对后果
and now she deals with the consequences.

499
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,621
你知道 这是 就像 一个游戏 对吗？
You know, it's, like, a game, right?

500
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,040
但是这也是 像是 寻找真爱 你知道吗？
But it's also, like, finding love, you know?

501
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,417
她他爹的到底在说什么？
What the fuck is she saying?

502
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,044
她要甩了布莱克斯顿
To dump Braxton,

503
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:52,005
现在她要自己面对后果
and now she deals with the consequences.

504
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,715
你知道 这是 就像 一个游戏 对吗？
You know, it's, like, a game, right?

505
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,759
但是这也是 像是 寻找真爱 你知道吗？
But it's also, like, finding love, you know?

506
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,735
真操蛋
God damn it.

507
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,404
你们能不能小声点？
Can you please keep it down?

508
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,242
闭嘴！
Shut up!

509
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,577
混蛋！
Assholes!

510
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,878
大家 都干了！两分钟之后开赛！
Everyone, drink up! We run in two minutes!

511
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,299
我眼球都冷了
My eyeballs are cold.

512
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,382
-对啊 -嗯 我也是
- Yeah. - Uh, same.

513
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,509
嘿！
Hey!

514
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,760
-你怎么在这儿！-金伯莉！
- You're here! - Kimberly!

515
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,154
什么...我还以为你要工作呢
What... I thought you had to work.

516
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:41,763
我觉得我干不来这活儿
I don't think I can do that job.

517
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,057
喝醉的澳大利亚人说话太难懂了
Drunk Australian people are so hard to understand,

518
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,268
尤其是在我们邻居做爱还这么大声的时候
especially with our neighbor having sex so loud.

519
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,371
这个嘛 你也不需要今晚解决所有问题
Well, you don't have to fix all your problems tonight,

520
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,564
但是有一件事你必须做
but there is one thing you do have to do.

521
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,940
确实是 脱掉你的外套
Exactly. Take off that coat.

522
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,525
让我们看看你的老奶奶内裤
Let me see those granny panties.

523
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,278
天哪
God damn,

524
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,114
原来过时衣服下的你这么性感
underneath all those unstylish clothes, you're, like, hot.

525
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:00,449
哦 那当然了
Oh, hell yeah,

526
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,868
姑娘 恭喜你穿内衣光彩夺目
congrats on the underwear glow-up, girl.

527
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,494
大家准备好开跑了吗？
Everybody ready to run?

528
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,873
三 二 一
Three, two, one,

529
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,791
脱掉外套开跑！
strip and go!

530
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,967
动一动啊 你这家伙！我很快的！
Move, bitch! I'm fast!

531
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,146
-嘿 -真不错
- Hey. - Yeah.

532
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,732
去他的Theta Omega Pi才是我们该来的地方
Fuck Theta. Omega Pi is where it's at.

533
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,951
我从来没有在同一个地方看见过这么多
I have never seen this many hot,

534
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,702
不穿衣服的帅哥
shirtless men in one place.

535
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,663
就是啊 我疯狂用眼睛截图
I know. I'm taking screenshots

536
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,373
待会儿再在脑海里欣赏
but with my brain for later.

537
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,167
我也一样 不过我还在手机里拍了些照片
Same, except I also tooka couple pictures on my phone.

538
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,252
哦 你看见那边的顺直大肌霸了吗？
Oh, see that pack of cis daddies right there?

539
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,189
我可以清晰地看见他们每个人的鸡巴形状
I can see every single one of their dick shapes.

540
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,507
那边的老兄 他的四角短裤里
Homie on the right got a big ol' toddler arm

541
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,050
可有根像小孩手臂这么粗的
in his boxer briefs.

542
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,678
-莱拉？-嗯？
- Lila? - Hmm?

543
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,238
你有没有兴趣为我的搞笑杂志写一篇
Would you ever be interested in writing a listicle

544
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:05,862
关于鸡巴形状的清单体文章？
about dick shapes for my comedy magazine?

545
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,283
这个 虽然我不知道清单体他爹的是个什么东西
Well, I don't know what the fuck a listicle is,

546
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,017
但是 妞儿 我当然愿意 让我们开写
but hell yes, bitch, let's do it.

547
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,156
嘿 我是萨拉
Hey, I'm Sara.

548
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,033
嘿 我是金伯莉 这是蕾登
Hey, I'm Kimberly. This is Leighton.

549
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,202
知道了 你想跳舞吗？
Cool. You wanna dance?

550
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:29,746
这个 我现在正和我朋友跳舞呢
Um, I'm actually just dancing with my friend right now.

551
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,123
好吧
Okay.

552
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,846
我本来打算要去厕所
I was actually gonna go to the bathroom,

553
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,793
所以我现在要去上厕所了
so I'm gonna go do that.

554
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,964
那么 嗯 想喝一杯吗？
So, uh, you want a shot?

555
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,800
闻着味道就知道 这肯定是非常差的龙舌兰酒
From the smell of it, I'd say it's shockingly bad tequila.

556
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,011
嗯 那真糟糕啊
Mm, horrible.

557
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,137
行啊 我来一杯
Yeah, I'm down.

558
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,305

No, let me do it for you.

559
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,599
张嘴
Open your mouth.

560
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,187
嗯 事实上 我可以的 我自己来
Um, actually, I'm good. I'm good.

561
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,273
嗯 抱歉 但是我只喝好酒
Um, sorry, but I only drink top shelf.

562
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,899
行吧
All right.

563
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,402
谢谢
Thanks.

564
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,243
-我的胸掉出来了吗？-没啊 没掉出来
- Are my boobs poppin' out? - No, you're good.

565
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:11,496
我正打算让微醺滑步成为我的标志性舞步呢
I'm trying to make on-purpose nip slips my signature move.

566
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,500
哦 那他爹的气候难民在这儿呢
Oh, that fucking climate refugee is here.

567
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,420
我的天 你看他拿着啤酒的样子
Holy shit. Look at him holding that beer.

568
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,671
他的手臂真的不得了
Dude has Marvel arms.

569
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,256
是啊 对 现在我有点知道
Yeah. Yeah, now I kind of get

570
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,383
为什么那个女孩叫这么大声了
why that girl was being so loud.

571
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,888
-你好 你是杰克逊 对吗？-对啊
- Hi. It's Jackson, right? - Yeah.

572
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,182
是这样 我是金伯莉 我住在你隔壁
Well, I'm Kimberly. My room is right next to yours.

573
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,100
-挺好的 -事实上不怎么好
- Cool. - It's actually not cool,

574
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,227
因为你才刚来艾塞克斯大概三天
because you've been at Essex for, like, three days,

575
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,854
你就已经完成了世界上最大声
and you're already having the loudest,

576
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,898
最有表现力的性爱
most performative sex in the world.

577
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,141
提醒你一下 这个学校里还有一些人
For your information, some of the people at this school

578
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,818
有真正的要紧事要做呢
have some really important work to do,

579
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,445
当你想让你自己不去听
and that's hard when you're,

580
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,328
墙对面的哼哼声的时候
you know, grunting your head off going like...

581
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,508
认真做事是很困难的
On the other side of some very,

582
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,201
墙非常薄 好吗？
very, thin drywall, okay?

583
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,786
-你说完了吗？-是的 我应该都说完了
- You done? - Yeah, I think so.

584
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,580
那个 你也知道 跟你们共用一堵墙
Well, just so you know, it actually kind of sucks

585
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,290
我也觉得挺糟糕的
sharing a wall with you too.

586
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,042
你最近看什么垃圾电视剧
What the hell ass TV show

587
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,127
看的这么大声
have you been watching so loudly?

588
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,296
那个是《性爱天堂：澳大利亚》
It's called "Sex Paradise: Australia."

589
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,839
我都不知道你还能听见这个
I didn't know you could hear it.

590
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,217
哦 我能听见的
Oh, I can.

591
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,135
让我看下你的手机
Let me see your phone.

592
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,938
我这个月流量已经用完了
I've already hit my data cap for the month,

593
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,473
别打开YouTube
so don't go on YouTube.

594
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,974
给你 现在你有我电话了
Here. Now you have my number.

595
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,726
要是我那边再有很吵的声音发出来
Just shoot me a text

596
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,730
你就给我发个短信
if anything on my side of the wall gets too loud.

597
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:22,651
-耶！-啊 不错啊 姑娘！
- Yeah! - Ah, yes, bitch!

598
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,160
我不知道啊 兄弟
I don't know, man.

599
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,580
关键是她除了足球真的啥也不会了
Thing is, she really doesn't have anything besides soccer,

600
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,749
所以我当时真的不知道说什么你知道吧？
so I didn't really know what to say, you know?

601
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,293
嘭！加油啊 我赢了
Boom! Let's go. That's mine.

602
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,937
这把我赢 滚回来 把球滚回来
That's all me. Run it back, run it back.

603
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,514
嘿 你还好吗？
Hey. You good?

604
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,933
嗯 我当然还好啦
Yeah. Course I am.

605
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,854
我刚刚吐在一个奖杯里了
I just threw up in a trophy.

606
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,522
谁还想再喝一杯？
Who wants another shot?

607
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,625
嘿 哇 哇 你在这儿喝的也太醉了
Hey, whoa, whoa, you are way too wasted to be here.

608
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,025
我该带你回家了
I think I gotta take you home.

609
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,360
不 不 不...
No, no, no...

610
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,796
-我等下给你发短信 -嗯嗯

611
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,172
说再见 冠军 该走了
Say goodbye, champ. It's time to go.

612
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,257
该走啦 呃 尝起来跟有人吐
Time to go. Ugh, it tastes like

613
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,699
在我嘴里一样
someone puked in my mouth!

614
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,409
你们今晚玩得开心吗？
Did you guys have fun tonight?

615
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,786
嗯 很开心！谢谢你的关心！
Yeah, we did! Thanks for asking!

616
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,246
不错
Great,

617
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,456
因为这是你们能去的最后一个派对了
because it'll be the last party you'll ever go to.

618
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,500
-老兄 你什么毛病啊？-说真的
- Dude, what is your problem? - Seriously.

619
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,669
是谁死了吗还让你管所有兄弟会？
Who died and made you king of all the frats?

620
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:23,920
你是个Theta成员
You're a Theta.

621
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,024
这些就是我跟你说过的女孩
These are the girls I was telling you about,

622
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,300
告我们密的人
the ones who narced on us.

623
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,718
你们是惹事精 姐们
You're a liability, bro.

624
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,220
惹事精？我们明明更惹人喜欢
A liability? More like like-ability.

625
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,889
有我们在身边可有意思了
We're a damn pleasure to have around.

626
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,223
-你们说是不是？-对啊

- I'm getting nipple frostbite. - Fuck.

630
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,238
昨晚除了我们被禁止进入兄弟会
Barring the fact that we got banned from frats last night,

631
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,865
我还是觉得玩的挺开心的
I still think we had a really fun time.

632
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,242
金伯莉有了那个气候难民的电话号码
Kimberly got climate refugee's phone number.

633
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,911
为了紧急事件
For emergencies.

634
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,705
那你呢 蕾登 你有跟帅哥搭讪吗？
What about you, Leighton, did you chat up any hotties?

635
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,167
行吧 你太优秀了让人难以亲近
Fine. You're too classy to kiss and tell.

636
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,376
我都懂的
I get it.

637

that I've been meaning to tell you guys.

639
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,934
我是弯的
I'm gay.

640
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,520
哇 蕾登 太酷了吧
Wow, Leighton, that's awesome.

641
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,356
我们应该报一下吗 我感觉我们应该拥抱一下
Should we hug? I feel like we should hug.

642
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,149
呃 不用 我们不需要 我们不需要拥抱
Uh, no, we don't... We don't need to hug.

643
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,277
哦 蕾登 这也太酷了 我 我也很震惊
Oh, Leighton, that's so cool. And I-I'm so shocked.

644
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,796
我是说 我不知道 我猜我的
I mean, I had no idea. I guess it's like

645
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,239
姬达可能失效了
my gaydar is way off or something.

646
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,740
金伯莉早就知道了 对吧？
Kimberly already knew, didn't she?

647
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,496
但她在这件事上真的是个好朋友
She's been a really good friend about it, though.

648
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,457
她昨晚在派对上甚至试着让我单独
She even tried to get me alone

649
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,000
和一个女孩儿待在一块儿
with a girl at the party last night.

650
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,419
哦 我的天哪 我看见跟你们说话的那个女孩了
Oh, my God, the girl I saw you talking to.

Yeah, but then... then I, like, freaked out and got weird,

654
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,137
她应该对我再也不感兴趣了 所以...
and she's probably not interested anymore, so...

655
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,556
不可能 如果你现在给她发消息
No way. If you DM'd her right now,

656
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,976
我保证事情还是有回转的余地的
I promise you it would be back on.

我都让他们改密码了
I literally had them change the buzzer code.

665
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,634
我等别人出去再进来的
I waited for someone to exit.
