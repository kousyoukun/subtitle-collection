00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:21,036
搞什么啊
{\fs11}What the fuck?

3
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,127
我们是卡帕会的姐妹 到处都有我们的踪影
{\fs11}Kappa Girls are we! And everywhere we are!

4
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:32,130
我们戴着神圣的字母K B R
{\fs11}We wear the sacred letters! K, B and R!

5
00:00:32,224 --> 00:00:34,674
现在才早上7点45分 你们在做什么
{\fs11}It's 7:45 in the morning! What is happening?

6
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,885
她惹麻烦了 还是在帮她庆祝
{\fs11}Is she in trouble or are they celebrating her?

7
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:39,304
我不知道 但以防万一 我还是跟着做
{\fs11}I don't know. I'm just clapping to be safe.

8
00:00:39,398 --> 00:00:40,639

你是否接受姐妹会的 这个重要职位
{\fs11}Do you accept this crucial role in our sisterhood?

11
00:00:47,906 --> 00:00:48,980
我接受
{\fs11}I do!

12
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:53,944
社交主席可以住 姐妹会宿舍最好的房间
{\fs11}The position comes with one of the absolute best rooms in the house.

13
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:56,071
我很期待你搬过来
{\fs11}I'm so excited for you to move in.

14
00:00:56,165 --> 00:00:59,574
所以你明年要搬到卡帕会了
{\fs11}So, you're like moving to Kappa next year?

15
00:00:59,668 --> 00:01:02,786
对 我想是吧

各位 我们走吧
{\fs11}Let's go, ladies!

等等 金柏丽呢
{\fs11}Wait, where's Kimberly?

21
00:01:17,394 --> 00:01:19,886
她们就像离岸流一样把我带走
{\fs11}I just got pulled into their group like a riptide.

22
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,859
各位都知道 学年快结束了
{\fs11}All right, everyone, as you know, the year is nearing its end,

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,448
没交的人必须参与宿舍抽签
{\fs11}If you don't submit one, you'll have to enter the rooming lottery.

25
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:43,159
跟没人要的怪胎和败类一起住
{\fs11}And live with the weirdos and losers no one else wants?

26
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:46,329
-不必了 听起来真惨 -对极了
{\fs11}Oh, no, thank you. That sounds bleak as hell. Truth.

00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:48,915
你们清晨时都听到了 我会搬到卡帕会
{\fs11}Well, as you all heard at dawn, I'm moving into Kappa,

28
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,793
我觉得非常幸运
{\fs11}and I am feeling very blessed.

29
00:01:51,887 --> 00:01:55,380
-所以请将我踢出这层楼的信息群组 -好吧
{\fs11}So please do remove me from this floor's text thread. Damn, okay.

30
00:01:55,474 --> 00:01:59,301
还没想清楚的人 我劝你们尽快考虑
{\fs11}And for those of you who haven't figured it out yet, I advise you to think on it.

31
00:01:59,394 --> 00:02:01,136
截止时间很快就到了
{\fs11}The deadline is coming up fast.

32
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,512
佛德拉 我有问题
{\fs11}Frude, related question,

33
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:05,974
如果有人用廉价胶水 毁了房间的墙壁
{\fs11}if someone sort of destroyed their walls by putting up wallpaper using cheap glue,

34
00:02:06,068 --> 00:02:08,476
会向这个人的父母收费吗
{\fs11}will his or her or their parents be charged for that?

35
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,228
-一定会 -好
{\fs11}Most definitely. Okay.

36
00:02:10,322 --> 00:02:13,732
我还有一个问题 有人有填泥料吗
{\fs11}The second related question, does anyone here have some spackle?

37
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:24,367
{\ZDX\fnMicrosoft JhengHei\an2\shad1\pos(192,215)\b1}艾赛克斯学生宿舍申请表

38
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,412
我可以问你一件事吗
{\fs11}Hey, can I ask you something?

39
00:02:27,506 --> 00:02:29,414
可以啊 什么事
{\fs11}Yeah, for sure. What's up?

40
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:33,460
-你明年想继续跟我住吗 -天啊 当然
{\fs11}Do you wanna room with me again next year? Oh, my gosh, yes.

41
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,296
我也想问同样的事 但我觉得开口问很羞耻
{\fs11}I was thinking the same thing, but I felt like a total loser for asking.

42
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,090
没错 我完全不想搬去卡帕会宿舍
{\fs11}Totally. I have zero interest in moving into the Kappa house.

43
00:02:39,184 --> 00:02:41,051
我们也已经了解彼此的怪癖了
{\fs11}And I like that we already know each other's quirks.

44
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:42,635
我有什么怪癖啊
{\fs11}Oh, what are my quirks?

45
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,554
等一下 我不想知道
{\fs11}Wait! Actually, I don't wanna know.

46
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:46,139
好
{\fs11}Okay.

47
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:49,100
你有时会在睡梦中跟琼奶奶说话
{\fs11}But sometimes you talk to someone named Grandma Joan in your sleep.

48
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:52,520
这我听过 营队的人 经常拿这件事说闲话
{\fs11}I've heard that before. People gossiped a lot about it at camp.

49
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:55,774
我们是要申请三人房 跟贝拉一起住呢
{\fs11}Should we consider a triple and include Bela,

50
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:57,650
还是我们俩住双人房就好
{\fs11}or doubles and just us?

51
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,904
-两个选项都可以考虑 -当然
{\fs11}- Maybe we consider both? - Sure.

52
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:02,113
-大家好 -贝拉
{\fs11}- Hey, guys! - Bela.

53
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:03,656
门关上的时候要敲门
{\fs11}When the door is closed, you knock.

54
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,784
学年要结束了 规则已经不适用了
{\fs11}It's the end of the year. Those rules don't apply anymore.

55
00:03:05,877 --> 00:03:08,536
你们看 我上了杂志 他们把我拍得很好看
{\fs11}Look at this. I'm in a magazine and I look great.

56
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,788
真的耶
{\fs11}You do.

57
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:12,749
还坐在钢琴边 就像性感版的贝多芬
{\fs11}Sitting at a piano looking like a sexy Beethoven.

58
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:15,085
我等不及要读了 但我得先去上课
{\fs11}I can't wait to read it, but I got to get to class.

59
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:19,172
好吧 金柏丽 空出你的时间 我们要把这些发给校园里所有的学生
{\fs11}Fine. But, Kimberly, clear your schedule because we're gonna pass these out to every student on campus.

60
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,966
-你买了几本啊 -75本
{\fs11}How many copies did you grab? Like, 75?

61
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,385
走吧
{\fs11}Come on.

62
00:03:23,478 --> 00:03:26,596
请你读读这个 31和32页有我哦
{\fs11}Hey, read this. I'm featured on pages 31 and 32.

64
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:31,643
贝拉 这篇文章把你写得好厉害
{\fs11}Bela, you come off amazing in this!

65

我知道
{\fs11}I know, right?

66
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:35,397
这可能对我的职涯发展很重要
{\fs11}Dude, this could be, like, huge for my career.

67
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,233
我把内容寄给蒂娜费 在各大电子信箱的地址
{\fs11}I sent it to tina.fey at all the big emails.

68
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,943
我真为你高兴
{\fs11}I'm so happy for you.

69
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:43,196
-你很努力 现在终于有成果了 -谢了
{\fs11}You've been working so hard, and it's finally paying off. Thanks, man.

70
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,491
你和小惠讨论过 明年的住宿了吗
{\fs11}Hey. Have you and Whit talked about housing stuff for next year yet?

71
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:49,369
还没有 你有什么想法
{\fs11}Oh, no. What were you thinking?

72

我要和喜剧杂志的 伊凡洁琳和乔搬到校园外
{\fs11}I'm gonna move off-campus with Evangeline and Jo from the comedy magazine.

73
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:53,498
有道理
{\fs11}Oh, okay. That makes sense.

74
00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:56,418
一定会很棒 我们要一起生活和写作
{\fs11}Yeah, it's gonna be great. We're gonna live together, write together.

75
00:03:56,511 --> 00:03:57,836
甚至一起嗑药
{\fs11}Maybe try drugs together.

76
00:03:57,929 --> 00:04:01,464
就像1970年代的"周六夜现场" 但女性和非白人更多
{\fs11}It's gonna be like SNL from the '70s, but, like, with way more women and non-whites.

77
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:04,217
-好 当然了 -但我们还是能常见面
{\fs11}- Okay. - We'll still hang out all the time though. - Yeah, for sure.

78

-我很乐意帮忙 -天啊 谢谢你
{\fs11} - I'd be happy to help. Oh, my God, thank you.

84
00:04:23,705 --> 00:04:26,156
太棒了
{\fs11}That was awesome!

85
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:27,907
你好像校园名人哦
{\fs11}You're like a campus celebrity.

86
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,826
对吧 我算是吧
{\fs11}I know, right? I kinda am.

87
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,204
你比那只我们 喂薯条的胖松鼠有名
{\fs11}You're more famous than that chubby squirrel we feed French fries to.

88
00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:35,373
天啊 我有一阵子没看到它了
{\fs11}Oh, my God. I haven't seen him in a while.

89
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:36,624
我也是
{\fs11}Me neither.

90
00:04:37,386 --> 00:04:38,543
不会吧
{\fs11}Oh, no.

91
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,882
我无意冒犯
{\fs11}Well, then, with all due respect,

92
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:47,260
莱西校长是个厌女的大浑蛋
{\fs11}President Lacey is a giant penis who hates all women.

93
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,262
这句话给你引用 贱货
{\fs11}Quote me, bitch.

94
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,139
还是跟平常一样友善
{\fs11}We are making friends like usual, huh?

95
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:53,141
学校把我们的经费减半
{\fs11}- Essex just cut our funding in half. -

96
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:55,185
-认真的吗 -我们会撑不下去
{\fs11}- Seriously? - This is gonna kill us.

97
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:57,395
-等等 他们为何这样 -不知道
{\fs11}- Wait, why would they do that? I don't know.

98
00:04:57,489 --> 00:05:01,399
或许因为异性恋白人生理男 组成的董事会不在乎女性
{\fs11}Maybe because the cis white hetero male board doesn't care about women

99
00:05:01,493 --> 00:05:03,693
或跨性别 或非二元族群
{\fs11}or trans, or non-binary folk.

100
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:06,362
你坐下吧 帮我们想想办法
{\fs11}Why don't you take a seat, help us figure out what we can do.

101
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:07,530
不用了
{\fs11}No, I'm good.

102
00:05:07,624 --> 00:05:11,159
我要参加卡帕会的重要活动 顺路来打声招呼
{\fs11}I was just popping in on my way to a very important Kappa event.

103
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:14,454
从来没人在这栋大楼说过这句话
{\fs11}Oh, something that no one has ever said in this building.

104
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,372
你一定会想到方法的
{\fs11}Well, I am sure you'll find your fix. Okay? 

105
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:21,628
但往后让托娃负责讲电话 他们比你讨喜多了
{\fs11}But, for the future, why don't you just let Tova handle the calls, okay? They are much more likable than you.

106
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:23,338
我刚也说同样的话
{\fs11}I just said that about myself.

107
00:05:23,432 --> 00:05:25,006
各位 我有好消息
{\fs11}Good news, everyone.

108
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,887
我刚跑了两个捐血站 靠捐血赚到四十美元
{\fs11}Guess who just made us $40 by donating blood at two different locations?

109
00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:33,473
金吉 你还好吗 你脸色很苍白
{\fs11}Ginger, are you okay? You look really pale.

110
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,892
我不能失去这里
{\fs11}I can't lose this place!

111
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:37,519
好
{\fs11}Okay.

112
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,981
等你忙完 我们可不可以聊聊
{\fs11}Hey, when you're done with that work, can I talk to you for a sec?

113
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:45,568
我没有在忙 我只是在查 四个人69叫什么
{\fs11}Oh, this isn't work. I'm trying to figure out what it's called when four people 69.

114
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:47,570
好像叫138
{\fs11}I think it's 138-ing.

115
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:49,364
这么说有点奇怪
{\fs11}Well, I feel kind of weird for saying this,

116
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:53,284
但我好像喜欢上同事了
{\fs11}but I think I have feelings for a coworker.

117
00:05:53,378 --> 00:05:56,746
金柏丽 我受宠若惊 但我对你没意思
{\fs11}Kimberly, I am so flattered, but I don't see you that way.

118
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,624
我说的是迦南 我不知道该怎么办
{\fs11}This is about Canaan. I don't know what to do.

119
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:03,169
我不能跟室友聊 因为他和惠妮交往过
{\fs11}Obviously, I can't talk to my roommates about it because of Whitney and him.

120
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,879
我完全懂你为何会喜欢他
{\fs11}Listen, I totally get why you're into him.

121
00:06:04,973 --> 00:06:09,133
迦南超帅 肌肉大 屁股又翘
{\fs11}Canaan is a hot boy with rippling muscles and two heaping scoops of ass,

122
00:06:09,227 --> 00:06:11,344
但我们都知道 你不能行动
{\fs11}but you and I both know that you can't act on this.

123
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:14,639
这可能会毁了你的朋友圈 室友关系和职场生涯
{\fs11}It could totally blow up your friend group, your rooming situation, and your work life.

124
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:18,184
-不值得的 -我知道 但或许他也喜欢我
{\fs11}It ain't worth it. I know, but maybe he has feelings for me too.

125
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:19,811
-没这回事 -怎么说
{\fs11}- He does not. - How do you know?

126
00:06:19,905 --> 00:06:21,646
我懂他的口味 你不是他的菜
{\fs11}I know his type, and you're not it.

127
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,648
他说你让他想起三年级的老师
{\fs11}He told me you remind him of his third grade teacher.

128
00:06:23,742 --> 00:06:24,941
或许她很不错啊
{\fs11}Maybe she was really cool.

129
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:26,776
他说她的脚踝超粗
{\fs11}He said she had cankles.

130
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,902
我懂了
{\fs11}- Oh. Got it.

131
00:06:27,996 --> 00:06:30,405
-他说你很像她 -我已经说我懂了
{\fs11}- That would be you in the situation. - Yeah, I said I got it.

132
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:32,949
我很抱歉 我感觉自己射杀了小鹿斑比
{\fs11}I'm so sorry. I feel like I shot Bambi.

133
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:35,785
换作是我 我会在学年剩下的时间躲避他
{\fs11}But, if I were you, I would avoid him for the rest of the year

134
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,911
忘了这件事
{\fs11}and forget about it.

135
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:38,037
你说得对
{\fs11}Yeah, I know you're right.

136
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,623
听着 所有人都有喜欢 但不能追求的人
{\fs11}Listen, we all have crushes that we can't act on.

137
00:06:40,717 --> 00:06:42,625
就像我的可乐送货员
{\fs11}Like me and the Pepsi delivery guy.

138
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:45,461
虽然我在他的卡车上 放了我胸部的照片
{\fs11}Sure, I left him Polaroids of my tits in his truck,

139
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:48,631
但我最多只会做到这样 因为我重视这份工作
{\fs11}but that is as far as I'll take it, because I'm a professional.

140
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:50,425
他听得到啦
{\fs11}I think he can hear you.

141
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,010
我就是要他听到
{\fs11}Yeah, I want him to.

142
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:53,511
你好 荷黑
{\fs11}Hey, Jorge.

143
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,976
你选好主修科目了
{\fs11}You're declaring your major?

144
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,813
对 我正式成为 生物化学和生物物理系的学生了
{\fs11}Yeah. I'm officially on the biochemistry and biophysics track.

145
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:06,608
所以你和男友 选一样的主修科目
{\fs11}So, you're gonna do the same major as your boyfriend?

146
00:07:06,701 --> 00:07:08,401
他不是我男友
{\fs11}He is not my boyfriend.

147
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:10,987
但我觉得自己是他女友 糟透了
{\fs11}But I do think I'm his girlfriend. It's bad.

148
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:13,823
惠妮 你并不喜欢他 你得赶快斩断情丝
{\fs11}Whitney! You don't like him. You need to end this

149
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:17,910
不然就会跟他一起上三十堂课 最后跟他结婚
{\fs11}before you take 30 more classes with him and end up marrying his ass.

150
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,621
我会处理的
{\fs11}I will handle it.

151
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:21,414
我今天就会找他谈
{\fs11}I'm going to talk to him today.

152
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,875
很好 你之前 只试着跟他分手两次
{\fs11}Great. You've only tried to break up with him two other times before,

153
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:26,169
希望这次会成功
{\fs11}so hopefully this one will stick.

154
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:35,470
大家好吗
{\fs11}How's everyone doing?

155
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:39,766
贝拉 搞什么 这篇文章只写到你
{\fs11}What the hell, Bela? This article is entirely about you.

156
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,603
你的名字出现的次数 比我们的杂志还要多
{\fs11}It literally says your name more than the name of our magazine.

157
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,438
怎么会有这种事
{\fs11}How did this happen?

158
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,440
我很抱歉 我也不知道
{\fs11}I'm so sorry. I have no idea.

159
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:50,234
我以为他要写的是我们所有人
{\fs11}I would have assumed he would have written about all of us.

160
00:07:51,162 --> 00:07:55,657
-有可能是记者喜欢上我了 -不是 他有对象了
{\fs11}Maybe the reporter has a crush on me or something. Nice try. He's seeing someone,

161
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,910
他狠心拒绝我之后告诉我的
{\fs11}which he told me after he rejected me brutally.

162
00:07:59,004 --> 00:08:03,164
这样我就没有头绪了 太奇怪了吧
{\fs11}Then I have no idea how this happened. This is so strange.

163
00:08:03,258 --> 00:08:06,459
上面写的好像《狐狸精》 是你一手打造出来的
{\fs11}It makes it look like you created the Foxy all by yourself.

164
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,836
他在刊登之前让你看过吗
{\fs11}Did he show this to you before he printed it?

165
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,632
没有 如果有的话 我会请他把我的胸部修大一点
{\fs11}No. If he had, I would have asked him to photoshop my boobs to look bigger.

166
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,136
这样吧 我现在打给他 要他撤掉这篇文章
{\fs11}You know what? I'll reach out to him right now and make sure he prints a retraction.

167
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,139
没关系 就当没这回事吧
{\fs11}It's fine. Let's just forget it.

168
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,019
我办不到 我决定了
{\fs11}I don't think I can. In fact,

169
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:27,188
我不会邀请你来我的准生日派对
{\fs11}you're uninvited to my half birthday party.

170
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:31,067
要来的人 我订了克莱尔餐厅
{\fs11}For those of you who are coming, I'm registered at Claire's,

171
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:34,237
希望在场至少有一个人尽快回复
{\fs11}and I would like it if at least one of you RSVP'd.

172
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:37,740
现在就能直接讲了
{\fs11}You can right now,

173
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:40,326
不要‥
{\fs11}vocally.

174
00:08:41,004 --> 00:08:42,578
继续工作吧
{\fs11}Let's just get back to work.

175
00:08:45,383 --> 00:08:47,625
她来了 "骄傲的同志爸爸"
{\fs11}There she is.

176
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:49,627
-女儿 -爸爸
{\fs11}- Hi, honey. - Hi, Dad.

177
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:53,297
我们讨论一下这件上衣好吗
{\fs11}Hey, can we talk about the shirt?

178
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:57,343
-好 我想告诉全世界我支持你 -那很好
{\fs11}Yes. I just wanted to show the world how much I support you. That's great.

179
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,887
只是大家可能以为 你是骄傲的"同志爸爸"
{\fs11}It just makes it seem like you're proud to be a gay dad.

180
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:02,098
我就是啊 我只是‥
{\fs11}Because I am. And I just want...

181
00:09:02,651 --> 00:09:06,978
难怪那个咖啡师语气怪怪的
{\fs11}Oh! That's why the barista called me Zaddy. Yes.

182
00:09:07,697 --> 00:09:09,397
-亲爱的 -妈妈
{\fs11}- Oh, sweetheart. - Hi.

183
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:11,274
-你好美 -谢谢
{\fs11}- Oh, you look great. - Thanks.

184
00:09:11,368 --> 00:09:13,317
你爸告诉我了
{\fs11}And your father told me.

185
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,112
我是女同志的事 对
{\fs11}That I'm lesbian. Yes, I am.

186
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:18,698
我只是希望 你能放宽心亲自告诉我
{\fs11}I just wish you felt comfortable telling me yourself.

187
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,867
你不是个好沟通的人
{\fs11}You are not exactly the chillest.

188
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:24,370
我记得有次度假时 我说想穿球鞋 你就哭了
{\fs11}I seem to remember you crying when I asked to wear sneakers on vacation.

189
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,289
我们去的是圣巴特
{\fs11}It was St. Barts.

190
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:28,833
我们可能会遇到洛恩麦可斯
{\fs11}We could have run into Lorne Michaels.

191
00:09:29,594 --> 00:09:31,669
为了想该对你说什么 我读了些文章
{\fs11}Well, I read several articles about what to say to you,

192
00:09:31,763 --> 00:09:34,130
我尊重你的性向 而且‥
{\fs11}so I acknowledge your sexuality and

193
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:35,381
我爱你
{\fs11}I love you.

194
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,592
我也爱你
{\fs11}I love you, too.

195
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:40,595
你准备好要参加 卡帕会春天节了吗
{\fs11}So, are you excited to go to the Kappa Spring Festival?

196
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:45,641
亲爱的 自从你入会 我就期待着跟你一起参加
{\fs11}Oh, honey. I have been looking forward to going to this event with you since the moment you got in,

197
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:49,812
我等不及看到 哪些同学变老变丑了
{\fs11}and I cannot wait to see which of my classmates have aged poorly.

198
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,439
祝你们玩得愉快
{\fs11}Well, you girls have fun.

199
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:56,068
我要去销毁我在1992年写的 伤人社论的唯一副本
{\fs11}I'm off to destroy the only copy of a very hurtful op-ed I wrote in 1992.

200
00:10:02,544 --> 00:10:05,369
-你在做什么 -我在挖一袋咖啡豆
{\fs11}What are you doing? I'm sifting through a bag of beans.

201
00:10:05,463 --> 00:10:07,663
莉拉觉得她的蓝牙耳机在里面
{\fs11}Lila thinks she dropped an AirPod in here.

202
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:09,832
你的衣服怎么了
{\fs11}What happened to your shirt?

203
00:10:09,926 --> 00:10:12,877
我绊倒了 把燕麦奶洒了一身
{\fs11}I tripped and spilled a gallon of oat milk on myself.

204
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:21,427
你今晚会去西塔会的派对吗
{\fs11}Oh! Oh, will I be seeing you at the Theta party tonight?

205
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,597
不会 我应该不会去
{\fs11}No. I don't think I can make it.

206
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:25,807
真可惜
{\fs11}It's too bad.

207
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,351
如果你改变心意再传信息给我
{\fs11}If you change your mind, text me.

208
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:33,773
我看起来如何
{\fs11}Okay. How do I look?

209
00:10:34,325 --> 00:10:36,442
-很干燥 -对
{\fs11}- Dry. - Right.

210
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:38,986
回头见
{\fs11}See ya.

211
00:10:45,003 --> 00:10:48,204
-你在这里啊 -天啊 是你啊
{\fs11}- There she is! - Oh, my God. Hi.

212
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:50,915
准备好看我精湛的报告了吗
{\fs11}Ready to watch me kill this presentation? Whoop!

213
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:53,668
准备好了
{\fs11}Yeah. Something up?

214
00:10:53,762 --> 00:10:55,294
有什么事吗
{\fs11}But don't worry about it.

215
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:58,422
有
{\fs11}Yes.

216
00:10:58,516 --> 00:11:01,175
但先别担心 我不想让你分心 我们下课再聊就好
{\fs11}I don't wanna throw you off. We can just talk after class.

217
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:04,929
我们现在就聊 你不说我就无法专心做实验
{\fs11}No, let's talk about it now. I'm not gonna be able to focus on my experiment if you don't tell me.

218
00:11:05,023 --> 00:11:07,974
-我觉得我们应该分手 -要命
{\fs11}I think we should break up. Shit.

219
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:10,393
我没想到你会说这个
{\fs11}Okay. It's not what I thought you were gonna say.

220
00:11:10,487 --> 00:11:12,144
我很抱歉
{\fs11}I'm sorry.

221
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,188
没关系
{\fs11}No, it's cool.

222
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:17,817
我们两个都太忙了 所以就‥
{\fs11}We're both super busy, so this is, like...

223
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,527
好聚好散 也好
{\fs11}It's mutual. It's good.

224
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:21,195
-你确定吗 -确定
{\fs11}- Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm fine.

225
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:23,948
我们走吧‥以朋友的身份
{\fs11}Let's get in there as friends. Come on.

226
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,037
我会持续滴定溶液 直到出现沉淀物
{\fs11}So, I'll keep titrating the solution until some precipitate forms,

227
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:33,374
根据我的估计应该‥
{\fs11}which, according to my estimate, should...

228
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:36,043
应该‥
{\fs11}Should...

229
00:11:37,347 --> 00:11:40,298
抱歉 我一时分心了
{\fs11}Sorry. Lost my focus.

230
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:43,843
-老兄 你在哭吗 -没有
{\fs11}Dude, are you crying? No.

231
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:47,889
只是我的眼睛现在很潮湿
{\fs11}My eyes are just really humid right now.

232
00:11:47,982 --> 00:11:52,685
总之 仔细看烧杯的底部就会发现‥
{\fs11}Anyway, so if you'll focus on the bottom of the beaker, you'll see...

233
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:57,315
对 我现在哭了
{\fs11}Okay. Now, yes, I am crying.

234
00:11:57,826 --> 00:11:59,984
我要去走廊上独处一下
{\fs11}I think I need a minute alone in the hallway.

235
00:12:04,165 --> 00:12:07,867
爱许丽 你期待明年 担任卡帕会会长吗
{\fs11}So, Ashlie, are you excited to be Kappa president next year?

236
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,368
天啊 非常期待
{\fs11}Oh, my goodness, yes.

237
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,704
我大四时也当过会长
{\fs11}You know, I was president my senior year

238
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:15,041
我帮姐妹会争取到有网络的电脑
{\fs11}and I got us a computer with the Internet on it.

239
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,626
是这样没错
{\fs11}Yes, you did.

240
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:18,377
这故事真酷 妈
{\fs11}Cool story, Mom.

241
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,963
爱许丽 做好心理准备 你会遇到很多事情
{\fs11}You need to buckle up, Ashlie. You are in for a lot.

242
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:25,468
我是校友会成员 感觉每天都有新的危机
{\fs11}I'm on the alumni board and every day it feels like some new crisis.

243
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:27,637
卡帕会有危机 像是什么
{\fs11}A Kappa crisis? Like what?

244
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,222
有人在浴室装难看的灯光吗
{\fs11}Did they install unflattering lighting in the bathrooms?

245
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:34,727
-你们听说雪城分会的事了吗 -没有
{\fs11}- No. Did you hear what happened at the Syracuse chapter? - No.

246
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:37,104
他们禁用了"姐妹会"这个词
{\fs11}- They banned the word "sisterhood."

247
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:38,314
为什么
{\fs11}Why would they do that?

248
00:12:38,408 --> 00:12:42,443
他们说这个词不精确 因为某些成员不是女性
{\fs11}Well, they said it's not accurate and that some of their members aren't women.

249
00:12:42,537 --> 00:12:46,030
-什么 -我莫名觉得这是好事
{\fs11}What? I don't know. I actually think that's a good thing,

250
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:49,700
使用更包容跨性别 和非二元族群的语言
{\fs11}you know, to create more inclusive language for trans and non-binary folk.

251
00:12:49,794 --> 00:12:53,037
我觉得如果不把自己视作女性
{\fs11}Well, I just think if you don't see yourself as a woman,

252
00:12:53,131 --> 00:12:56,123
那就去组成自己的社团 让我们当姐妹会
{\fs11}then form your own group. Let us be sisters.

253
00:12:56,217 --> 00:13:01,003
但他们缺乏校方的支持和资金 要怎么自组社团呢
{\fs11}But how can they form their own clubs with no support or funding from the school, you know?

254
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:04,090
不要误会 我最好的朋友是同志
{\fs11}Just to be clear, - my best friend is a homosexual.

255
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,257
-雷夫吗 -对
{\fs11}- Ralph? - Yes.

256
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,427
-我很爱雷夫 -他很幽默吧
{\fs11}- Love Ralph. Isn't he funny?

257
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,595
我虽然也是同志
{\fs11}Sure, I'm gay, too,

258
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:14,266
但这件事在这个对话中 不代表什么 不是吗
{\fs11}but that is actually meaningless in the context of this conversation, isn't it?

259
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,268
小蕾 借一步说话好吗
{\fs11}Leight, can I borrow you for a sec?

260
00:13:18,448 --> 00:13:21,565
我知道这些老校友的观念有点过时
{\fs11}Look, I know these boomer alums aren't the most up to date on things,

261
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:24,819
但今天的重点是跟她们募款
{\fs11}but today is sort of about getting donation checks from them.

262
00:13:24,913 --> 00:13:26,529
我保证 跟她们争不值得
{\fs11}I promise it's not worth engaging.

263
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:30,658
如果我们不跟她们争 有谁会跟她们争
{\fs11}Right. But if we don't engage with them, then who is going to?

264
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:32,827
也许你该去找其他人说话
{\fs11}Maybe you should go talk to somebody else.

265
00:13:41,137 --> 00:13:42,753
佐伊 我不想让你难过
{\fs11}Oh, Zoe, I don't mean to rub it in,

266
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:46,716
但你没有跟迦南一起去 经济系的宴会真是太可惜了
{\fs11}but you really missed out on not going to that Econ banquet with Canaan.

267
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:48,718
什么经济系的宴会
{\fs11}What Econ banquet?

268
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:50,177
迦南得奖的那个宴会
{\fs11}The one where Canaan got that award.

269
00:13:50,271 --> 00:13:52,513
超级好玩 而且食物超好吃
{\fs11}It was so fun, and the food was so good.

270
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:56,809
我喝了一堆汤 结果发现汤只是开胃菜
{\fs11}I loaded up on soup, and then I realized it was just the appetizer.

271
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,894
我不知道你在说什么
{\fs11}Yeah. I don't know what you're talking about.

272
00:13:58,988 --> 00:14:00,479
真的吗
{\fs11}Really?

273
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,441
他说他先邀请你 你没空才邀请我的
{\fs11}He said he invited you before inviting me, and you were busy.

274
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:05,609
绝对没有这种事
{\fs11}That definitely did not happen.

275
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,655
我失陪一下
{\fs11}Will you excuse me a moment?

276
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,907
莉拉 你想去今晚的西塔会派对吗
{\fs11}Lila, do you wanna go to that Theta party tonight?

277
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:13,534
妹子 我本来就会去
{\fs11}Bitch, I've been going to go.

278
00:14:13,628 --> 00:14:16,537
我会穿一件突显我胸形的洋装
{\fs11}And I'm wearing a dress that makes my tits sing.

279
00:14:18,216 --> 00:14:20,833
-谢谢你跟我见面 -当然 我很乐意
{\fs11}Thanks again for meeting up with me. Of course. I'm happy to.

280
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,128
谢谢你在期末考抽空跟我见面 其他时间我都没空
{\fs11}Oh, and thank you for meeting me during your final exam. No other times worked for me.

281
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:27,590
你太厉害了 我想尽可能向你学习
{\fs11}You're just so impressive. I want to learn as much as I can from you.

282
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,342
我读过你的作品集了
{\fs11}So I read your packet and...

283
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:35,181
-我觉得你该考虑退出《狐狸精》 -退出
{\fs11}- I think you should consider quitting the Foxy. - Quit?

284
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:37,391
巧嘉 我觉得你很酷 聪明 又幽默
{\fs11}- Jorja, I think you're cool and smart and funny, and in that way,

285
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:39,310
所以你让我想到自己
{\fs11}you really remind me of myself.

286
00:14:39,404 --> 00:14:43,064
但不是所有又酷 又聪明 又幽默的人都能成为喜剧写手
{\fs11}But not everyone who is cool and smart and funny has what it takes to be a comedy writer.

287
00:14:43,157 --> 00:14:44,815
是哦
{\fs11}Okay?

288
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:47,276
我知道你能擅长什么了
{\fs11}Oh, you know what I think you'd be great at?

289
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,569
-广告 -什么
{\fs11}- Advertising. - What?

290
00:14:48,663 --> 00:14:51,155
我敢说你一定能写出 可爱的清洁用品广告
{\fs11}I bet you could write really cute commercials for, like, cleaning products,

291
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:53,365
或是聪明的优格广告
{\fs11}or, like, a clever yogurt ad.

292
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,951
我对那个没兴趣
{\fs11}I'm not really interested in that.

293
00:14:56,045 --> 00:15:00,331
你真的没办法 针对我的作品给任何回馈吗
{\fs11}Do you seriously not have any feedback for me on anything I wrote?

294
00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:02,374
我能告诉你哪些笑话不好笑
{\fs11}I could tell you all the things that didn't really work in here,

295
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,461
但我觉得这只是在浪费我们的时间
{\fs11}but I just don't think that's a good use of either of our time.

296
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:08,380
天啊 至少你很诚实
{\fs11}Well, at least you're honest.

297
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,382
当然 你没问题的 巧嘉
{\fs11}Always. You got this, Jorja.

298
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,385
你写笑话不行 但其他方面可以的
{\fs11}I mean, not this, but something else.

299
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,765
你要我帮你丢掉吗
{\fs11}Oh, did you want me to throw this away for you?

300
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,980
谢谢你的捐款 对我们会很有帮助
{\fs11}Thank you so much for these. They're gonna do a lot of good.

301
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:27,316
卡帕会亲亲
{\fs11}Kappa kisses.

302
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:33,781
宝贝女儿
{\fs11}Honey,

303
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,325
你还好吗 你整天都好安静
{\fs11}are you okay? You've been quiet all day.

304
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,119
我也不确定
{\fs11}Yeah. I don't know.

305
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:40,663
我‥
{\fs11}I...

306
00:15:41,424 --> 00:15:43,624
我好像不想继续待在这里了
{\fs11}I don't think I want this anymore.

307
00:15:43,718 --> 00:15:46,669
亲爱的 你怎么了
{\fs11}Oh, sweetie, what is going on?

308
00:15:46,763 --> 00:15:48,838
我想跟你一样加入卡帕会
{\fs11}I wanted to be in Kappa just like you,

309
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:52,049
但我觉得这里让我很不自在
{\fs11}but I don't feel like me when I'm here.

310
00:15:52,143 --> 00:15:55,511
你可能只是改变了 这也没关系
{\fs11}I think you've just changed, and that's okay.

311
00:15:55,605 --> 00:15:58,013
我很抱歉 我知道 你很希望我加入卡帕会
{\fs11}I'm really sorry. I know how bad that you wanted this for me

312
00:15:58,107 --> 00:16:00,474
我不想让你失望
{\fs11}and I just didn't want to let you down.

313
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:02,726
不会‥别说了
{\fs11}Oh, no, no, stop.

314
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,353
我只是希望你开心
{\fs11}I just want you to be happy.

315
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:07,148
你不想参加卡帕会 就不要参加
{\fs11}If you don't wanna be in Kappa, then don't.

316
00:16:07,241 --> 00:16:12,027
人生很短 不需要浪费在 让你不快乐的事物上
{\fs11}Life is too short to waste on things that don't bring you happiness.

317
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:14,446
所以我们才跟奶奶断绝联络
{\fs11}That's why we don't see Grandma anymore.

318
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:18,242
-我爱你 妈 -我也爱你 蕾登
{\fs11}I love you, Mom. I love you so much, Leighton.

319
00:16:18,336 --> 00:16:19,952
见到你很高兴 蜜咪
{\fs11}Lovely to see you, Mimi.

320
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:23,330
我也是 莫娜 卡帕会亲亲
{\fs11}Oh, always a pleasure, Mona. Kappa kisses.

321
00:16:23,424 --> 00:16:26,709
真是个笨八婆 对吧
{\fs11}What a dumb whore. Am I right?

322
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:30,337
-天啊 -她曾经问我"饼干"要怎么写
{\fs11}Oh, my God. You know, she once asked me how to spell the word "biscuit."

323
00:16:30,431 --> 00:16:32,673
妈 你太坏了
{\fs11}Mom, you are such a bitch.

324
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,925
我们一起念大学的话 一定会是好友
{\fs11}Oh, my God, we would have been good friends in college.

325
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:37,011
那是肯定的
{\fs11}For sure, we would have been.

326
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:43,642
大一最后一次在派对前喝酒 干啦
{\fs11}Last pregame of freshman year, let's go!

327
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:58,866
不敢相信这是在这间房的最后一杯酒 我好想哭哦
{\fs11}I can't believe this is the last shot we'll take in this room. I could cry.

328
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,243
我们今天的打扮 是有史以来最辣的
{\fs11}Guys, can I just say that this is the hottest we've ever looked?

329
00:17:01,337 --> 00:17:05,956
惠妮你那身紫色低胸洋装 看起来就像性感版的恐龙邦尼
{\fs11}I mean, Whitney, that dress. Serving purple and serving tits? You look like a sexy Barney.

330
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,708
谢谢‥
{\fs11}Thank you. Thank you.

331
00:17:07,802 --> 00:17:08,834
我现在单身
{\fs11}Listen, I'm single,

332
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,170
我希望这个学年有个精彩的结尾
{\fs11}and I'm ready to end this year with a bang.

333
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:13,631
我很高兴能跟你们一起玩
{\fs11}Okay. Well, I am just excited to have fun with my girls.

334
00:17:13,724 --> 00:17:15,507
我也是
{\fs11}Me, too.

335
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,259
我的老天爷啊
{\fs11}Holy shit.

336
00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:19,511
-各位暂停一下 -怎么了
{\fs11}- Guys, stop! - What's wrong?

337
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,388
-我要被取消了 -什么
{\fs11}- I'm getting canceled. - What?

338
00:17:21,482 --> 00:17:24,099
《狐狸精》有个女生 在社群媒体上炮轰我
{\fs11}This girl from the Foxy is blasting my ass on social media.

339
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:25,935
-我确定没那么糟啦 -对啊
{\fs11}- I'm sure it's not that bad. - Yeah.

340
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:30,481
我在艾赛克斯所谓的 女性主义喜剧杂志学到五件事
{\fs11}Five things I learned at Essex's so-called feminist comedy magazine.

341
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:33,400
或许是在赞美你 她说学到东西了
{\fs11}Maybe it's a nice post. She said she learned things.

342
00:17:33,494 --> 00:17:36,987
贝拉摩赫查是个 厌女的喜剧独裁者
{\fs11}"Bela Malhotra is a misogynistic comedy dictator"

343
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:39,865
她痛恨所有女性 包括她自己
{\fs11} who hates all women, including herself.

344
00:17:40,835 --> 00:17:42,076
太糟糕了
{\fs11}Fuck. This is so bad.

345
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,579
天啊 我得放弃喜剧 跟我的笨蛋亲戚一样去当药师了
{\fs11}Oh, my God. I'm gonna have to quit comedy and become a pharmacist like all my dumb cousins.

346
00:17:45,673 --> 00:17:47,623
一定有什么误会
{\fs11}There has to be a misunderstanding.

347
00:17:47,717 --> 00:17:49,917
我同意 你绝对不讨厌自己
{\fs11}Yeah, I agree. I mean, you definitely don't hate yourself.

348
00:17:50,011 --> 00:17:52,419
-你反而是过度自恋了 -没错
{\fs11}- If anything, you like yourself too much. - Exactly.

349
00:17:52,513 --> 00:17:55,381
听着 你明天去找她把话说清楚
{\fs11}Listen, just talk to this girl tomorrow and smooth it over.

350
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,675
-别让这件事毁了今晚 -我赞同惠妮
{\fs11}- Yeah. - You don't need to let it ruin your night. I'm with Whitney.

351
00:17:57,768 --> 00:18:01,178
那女的只有四十个追踪者 没人会看到她的文章
{\fs11}I mean, the girl has, like, 40 followers, okay? Nobody will ever see that.

352
00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:03,597
你们说得对 出门前再喝一杯吧
{\fs11}Yeah, you're right. All right, let's take one more shot before we go.

353
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:05,432
-没错 谢谢你 -这就对了
{\fs11}Yes. Thank you.

354
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:07,351
或者小睡五分钟再出门
{\fs11}Or we could take a five-minute nap and then go.

355
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:09,812
-你在开玩笑吗 -好啦
{\fs11}- Are you fucking kidding me? - No! All right.

356
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,533
天啊 这个派对太棒了
{\fs11}Shit! This party is going off.

357
00:18:22,627 --> 00:18:26,912
我最爱的贱货们来了 好极啦
{\fs11}My favorite bitches! Yeah!

358
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,747
欢迎来到大冒险派对
{\fs11}Welcome to the Dare or Dare Party.

359
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:32,668
你们得进行酒杯底下写的大冒险
{\fs11}You are obligated to do the dare written on the bottom of your cup.

360
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:36,463
-有哪种大冒险 -我都看过了 那边的都是色色的事
{\fs11}Oh! What kind of dares? I've read them all. On the side of the table, they're horny.

361
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:38,215
这边的简直下流
{\fs11}And here, they're just plain nasty.

362
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:40,134
我两边都各拿了一杯
{\fs11}I took one of both. Oh.

363
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:42,303
跟红发的人亲嘴
{\fs11}Smash face with a redhead.

364
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:44,138
我要那一杯
{\fs11}I want that one.

365
00:18:44,232 --> 00:18:46,265
-好 -谢谢你
{\fs11}- Okay. - Thank you.

366
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:50,019
该死 乔丝琳 我不要在这里揉陌生人的胸部
{\fs11}Damn it, Jocelyn, I'm not gonna jiggle a stranger's tit at this party.

367
00:18:50,112 --> 00:18:53,605
怎么是"电臀舞" 我办不到 小时候我被禁止用下半身跳舞
{\fs11}Twerk? I can't twerk. I wasn't allowed to dance with my bottom half growing up.

368
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,150
我们不必真的做 对吧
{\fs11}We don't actually have to do these, do we?

369
00:18:57,495 --> 00:18:59,445
乔丝琳显然不这么觉得
{\fs11}Oh, Jocelyn seems to think we do.

370
00:19:00,081 --> 00:19:01,697
天啊
{\fs11}Oh, my God.

371
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,950
好咸湿的吻
{\fs11}That is a lot of tongue.

372
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,078
我今晚把牙齿刷得很干净
{\fs11}I brushed my teeth so good tonight,

373
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:11,540
一定能在派对上找到人亲热
{\fs11}I am 1,000% making out with someone at this party.

374
00:19:11,634 --> 00:19:14,543
我们组成搭档 帮助彼此向帅哥美女进攻吧
{\fs11}Let's pick out some hotties and wingwoman each other hard.

375
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:16,086
好啊‥
{\fs11}Okay. Okay,

376
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,922
我来物色一下对象
{\fs11}sure. Let's see my options.

377
00:19:19,016 --> 00:19:22,760
有个男的在吸塔可钟的辣酱包
{\fs11}Okay. We got a guy slurping a Taco Bell fire sauce packet.

378
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:26,597
还有一个舞步 根本赶不上拍子的人
{\fs11}And a dude who's dancing tragically off the beat.

379
00:19:26,691 --> 00:19:28,974
现场没有我喜欢的类型
{\fs11}Yeah. I don't think any of these guys are my type.

380
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,352
你要找的是什么类型
{\fs11}So, what are you looking for?

381
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:38,776
找到我再告诉你
{\fs11}I will let you know when I see it.

382
00:19:45,543 --> 00:19:47,326
-你来了 -是你
{\fs11}- Hey. - Hey!

383
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,829
-你不是说没办法来吗 -结果我还是来了
{\fs11}I thought you said you weren't coming? Turns out I am, and did.

384
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,792
-你在做什么 -找到我想做的大冒险酒杯
{\fs11}What are you doing? I'm trying to find a cup with a dare I actually wanna do.

385
00:19:54,885 --> 00:19:57,544
这杯写着"脸埋进莉拉胸部" 上面还有她的号码
{\fs11}This one says, "Motorboat Lila," and it has her phone number.

386
00:19:57,638 --> 00:19:59,129
一定是她自己写的
{\fs11}Yeah, she definitely wrote that one.

387
00:19:59,223 --> 00:20:02,174
做个举手之劳 把那杯丢掉好吗
{\fs11}Can you just be a good citizen and throw it out?

388
00:20:03,561 --> 00:20:04,843
那杯上面写什么
{\fs11}Wait, what's that one?

389
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,055
亲吻陌生人
{\fs11}Kiss a stranger.

390
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:10,682
这个还不错
{\fs11}That one's not a bad one.

391
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:15,020
我们认识彼此 所以你安全了
{\fs11}Well, we both know each other, so you're in the clear, sir.

392
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,146
是啊
{\fs11}Yeah.

393
00:20:18,534 --> 00:20:19,566
迦南
{\fs11}- Yo, Canaan! - Oh!

394
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,112
我朋友到了 我要‥
{\fs11}My friends just got here, so I'm gonna...

395
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:25,823
-行 你去吧 -好 先走了 再见
{\fs11}Yeah, of course. Go. - I'll go. All right. - Yeah.

396
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:36,291
金吉 我喜欢你在室内穿大衣
{\fs11}Ginger, love that you're wearing a long coat indoors.

397
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:38,794
谢谢 这件是我的老人邻居的
{\fs11}Thank you! It belonged to my elderly neighbor.

398
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:40,504
我不能久待
{\fs11}But I can't stay long.

399
00:20:40,598 --> 00:20:44,133
我今晚又捐了两次血 现在很虚弱
{\fs11}I gave blood twice again this evening, so I am feeling weak.

400
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:47,302
而且我不喜欢 那个男的看我的眼神
{\fs11}Also, I do not like the way that guy is looking at me.

401
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,516
-你去找地方坐吧 -好
{\fs11}- Why don't you go sit down? - Okay.

402
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:56,145
-我晚点再去照顾她 她没事的 -确定她没事
{\fs11}- I'll go deal with that later. - You sure she's good? - She's fine.

403
00:20:56,238 --> 00:20:58,480
卡帕会怎么样
{\fs11}So, how is Kappa?

404
00:20:58,574 --> 00:21:00,607
-我退出了 -不会吧
{\fs11}I quit. Oh, no.

405
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:03,152
你找到有更多 金发女的地方住了吗
{\fs11}Did you find an even blonder place to live?

406
00:21:03,621 --> 00:21:06,155
-等等 你是说真的 -是真的
{\fs11}Wait, are you being serious? I am.

407
00:21:06,248 --> 00:21:09,408
我发现我宁愿 在女性中心多花点时间
{\fs11}I decided I would rather spend my time at the Women's Center,

408
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:13,245
跟我真正喜欢的人相处
{\fs11}you know, with people I actually like.

409
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:16,957
如果你又破坏雕像被罚社区服务
{\fs11}If this is because you vandalized another statue and got community service,

410
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:18,125
我会发现的
{\fs11}I will find out.

411
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:21,628
对了 还有这个
{\fs11}Also, I have this.

412
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:28,302
天啊 三万美元
{\fs11}Holy shit! $30,000?

413
00:21:28,396 --> 00:21:30,345
我妈本来要捐给卡帕会
{\fs11}My mom was gonna donate it to Kappa,

414
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:33,056
我告诉她哪里更用得上这笔钱
{\fs11}so I told her where it would do better things.

415
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,601
这笔钱能救我们一命
{\fs11}This is going to completely save us!

416
00:21:39,323 --> 00:21:43,317
-抱歉 我不该这么做的 -没关系‥你应该要的
{\fs11}I am so sorry. I should not have done that. No, no, no, no, no. You should have.

417
00:21:43,411 --> 00:21:44,860
你女友泰坦怎么办
{\fs11}What about your girl Tatum?

418
00:21:44,954 --> 00:21:47,946
在你募款会那天晚上 我跟她分手了
{\fs11}I ended things with her. The night of your fundraiser, actually.

419
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,616
因为我打扮成艾尔顿强很性感吗
{\fs11}Because of how hot I looked in my Elton John costume?

420
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,826
那套衣服还在 我现在可以马上去换
{\fs11}You know, I still have that. I could go get it right now.

421
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,203
够了啦
{\fs11}Shut up.

422
00:22:06,434 --> 00:22:08,342
迦南 你要走了
{\fs11}Canaan, are you leaving?

423
00:22:08,436 --> 00:22:11,303
对 我们要去埃奇伍德的派对
{\fs11}Yeah. A bunch of us are headed to a party on Edgewood.

424
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:13,305
你想一起来吗
{\fs11}You wanna come with?

425
00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:21,980
不用了 我要留在这里
{\fs11}Oh! No. I'm going to stay.

426
00:22:22,616 --> 00:22:24,858
-祝你玩得开心 -好 再见
{\fs11}Have fun.

427
00:22:37,715 --> 00:22:40,207
-贝拉 -是你们啊
{\fs11}Okay, bye. - Bela. - Hey!

428
00:22:40,301 --> 00:22:43,794
这里有一张沙发要丢 我们搬到明年的宿舍好吗
{\fs11}There's a couch here that they're trying to get rid of. Should we take it for the house next year?

429
00:22:43,888 --> 00:22:46,630
他们叫那张沙发"精子银行" 但我们不必沿用
{\fs11}They call it the sperm bank, but we don't have to call it that.

430
00:22:46,724 --> 00:22:49,508
-巧嘉的贴文太夸张了 -我知道
{\fs11}That post from Jorja is so messed up. I know.

431
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,552
她反应太大了 对吧
{\fs11}Huge overreaction, right?

432
00:22:51,645 --> 00:22:55,097
喜剧写手要脸皮厚一点 看看我在《卡特兰》的遭遇
{\fs11}Copywriters need to have a thick skin. Look at all the stuff that happened to me at the Catullan.

433
00:22:55,191 --> 00:22:57,391
我们不是站在你这边的
{\fs11}Dude, we're not agreeing with you.

434
00:22:57,485 --> 00:22:59,601
你在《卡特兰》的遭遇确实很糟
{\fs11}What happened to you at the Catullan was horrible.

435
00:22:59,695 --> 00:23:03,564
我们开办这本杂志 就是为了提供一个友善的环境
{\fs11}And our magazine was created to be a better alternative to that toxic shit.

436
00:23:03,657 --> 00:23:07,526
你不记得了吗 这个团队是你建立起来的
{\fs11}Don't you remember? I mean, since you were the one who created our group.

437
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,778
等等 你们是在气这件事吗
{\fs11}Wait, is that what this is about?

438
00:23:09,872 --> 00:23:13,282
你们只是在气 我在那篇文章中得到太多功劳
{\fs11}You guys are just mad that I'm still getting too much credit in that article.

439
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,409
我们跟那个记者谈过了 贝拉
{\fs11}We talked to the reporter, Bela.

440
00:23:15,503 --> 00:23:18,328
他先让你看过文章 你骗了我们
{\fs11}He showed you the article. You lied to us.

441
00:23:18,422 --> 00:23:21,790
那篇文章是一回事 贝拉自私是很正常的
{\fs11}That article was one thing. That was normal, selfish Bela.

442
00:23:21,884 --> 00:23:24,626
但对巧嘉那么狠毒是不对的
{\fs11}But being that brutal to Jorja, it's not okay.

443
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,628
巧嘉在网络上对你的描述
{\fs11}And what Jorja put online about you?

444
00:23:26,722 --> 00:23:29,631
我觉得非常恰当
{\fs11}I'd say it was pretty fucking well-written.

445
00:23:29,725 --> 00:23:32,134
-你被逐出《狐狸精》了 -什么
{\fs11}- You're fired from the Foxy. - What?

446
00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:36,346
显然只有你符合你的喜剧水平
{\fs11}Clearly, you're the only person who lives up to your own comedy standards,

447
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,098
你就自己一个人搞笑吧
{\fs11}so go be funny alone.

448
00:23:38,192 --> 00:23:41,643
拜托别这样 这样我们明年当室友会很尴尬
{\fs11}No, please don't do this. This is gonna make living together super awkward next year.

449
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:43,478
我们把你的房间让给卡拉了
{\fs11}- We gave your room to Carla.

450
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:46,231
-等等 真的吗 -真的
{\fs11}- Wait, we did? - We did.

451
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:48,900
-也好 -等一下‥
{\fs11}Fine.

452
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:52,362
该死
{\fs11}Fuck!

453
00:23:54,124 --> 00:23:56,533
莉拉 我可以问个问题吗
{\fs11}Hey, Lila, can I ask you a question?

454
00:23:56,627 --> 00:23:58,535
我目前不接受回答问题
{\fs11}I'm not currently taking any questions.

455
00:23:58,629 --> 00:24:00,537
杯子说我得找五十个人接吻
{\fs11}My cup said I had to find 50 people to kiss

456
00:24:00,631 --> 00:24:02,205
但我只找到34个
{\fs11}and I've only found 34.

457
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:06,918
-好 35个了 -很高兴能帮忙 你看到迦南了吗
{\fs11}- Oh. - Okay, 35. Happy to help. Have you seen Canaan?

458
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,254
-他刚才离开了 -好吧
{\fs11}- He left a little bit ago. - Okay.

459
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:11,632
若你见到他 请他明天要开啜饮馆的门
{\fs11}But if you see him, let him know that he's gonna open up Sips tomorrow

460
00:24:11,725 --> 00:24:14,468
因为我打算请病假
{\fs11}because I do plan on calling out sick to myself.

461
00:24:14,562 --> 00:24:15,927
好
{\fs11}- Okay.

462
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,429
再见 35号
{\fs11}- Bye, 35.

463
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,099
你好 36号
{\fs11}Hi, number 36.

464
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:24,853
你好可爱 你喜欢比 自己高很多的女生吗
{\fs11}You're cute. You like your women much, much taller than you?

465
00:24:41,171 --> 00:24:42,329
迦南
{\fs11}Canaan!

466
00:24:46,844 --> 00:24:48,627
我可以跟你说句话吗
{\fs11}- Hey. - Hey. Can I talk to you for a sec?

467
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:50,170
好啊
{\fs11}Yeah.

468
00:24:50,264 --> 00:24:52,714
你们先走吧 我等等过去
{\fs11}Y'all go on. I'll catch up with you.

469
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:54,341
-怎么了 -你骗了我
{\fs11}- What's up? - You lied.

470
00:24:54,435 --> 00:24:55,676
我骗你
{\fs11}I lied?

471
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:57,427
-骗你什么 -佐伊
{\fs11}About what? Zoe.

472
00:24:57,521 --> 00:24:58,887
你没邀请她参加活动
{\fs11}You never invited her to that event.

473
00:24:58,981 --> 00:25:01,515
她跟我说了 你为什么要说谎
{\fs11}She told me. Why would you lie?

474
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:03,600
好问题
{\fs11}That's a great question.

475
00:25:03,694 --> 00:25:05,977
因为我根本没理由骗你
{\fs11}Because that lie would make no sense.

476
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:09,481
你希望我跟你一起去 我是你第一个邀请的人
