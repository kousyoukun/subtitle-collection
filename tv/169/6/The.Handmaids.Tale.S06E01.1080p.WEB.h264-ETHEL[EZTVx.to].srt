00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,660
我杀了弗莱德
I killed Fred.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,800
我觉得应该把弗雷德的葬礼
I think we need to make Fred's funeral

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,460
举办成一场令世界瞩目的事件

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,760
她穿的什么颜色
What was that color?

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,010
- 紫色代表什么 - 我不知道
- What does purple mean? - I don't know.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,200
她不再是小女孩了
She's not a little girl anymore.

8
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,350
汉娜穿的紫色衣服 是什么意思
The purple color Hannah was wearing, what does it mean?

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,480
新学校 培养主教妻子的学校

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,690
我想留在这里
I want to stay here.

11
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,830
女性在这不安全 尤其是未婚女性
It's not safe for women in this place. Especially unmarried women.

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,700
你是个不同寻常的女人 赛丽娜
You're an unusual woman, Serena.

13
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,000
我们这里没有
We don't have the infrastructure

14
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,880
不同寻常女性的位置
for unusual women.

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,800
你将成为全球形象大使
You'll be acting as a global ambassador,

16
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,470
能更好地代表我们神圣的共和国
to best represent our sacred republic.

17
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,500
唯一能够阻止他们的方式
The only way to stop her,

18
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,940
就是送他们去见阎王
and to stop them is to put them all in the fucking ground.

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,760
她会把这里也变成基列国
She's gonna bring it here.

20
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,160
我发誓 她会把这里变成基列国
I swear to fucking God. She is gonna bring it here.

21
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,920
面对一群叛徒者 罪犯和恐怖分子
A bunch of traitors, criminals, terrorists,

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,290
你却想欢迎他们回来
and you want to welcome them back.

23
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,970
如果我们继续筑起高墙 闭关锁国
If we keep the walls up and the borders closed,

24
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,260
国家会走向灭亡
this country will die.

25
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,980

{\an8}美国佬滚回家

28
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,450
加拿大厌恶我国难民
Canada's sick of our refugees.

29
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,120
这就是我带你们来到新伯利恒的原因
That's why I brought you to New Bethlehem,

31
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,500
基列国难民愿意重回的家园
where Gilead refugees can come home.

32
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,800
我已经能想象到你和萝丝在这里
I could see you and Rose here.

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,680
推你们的孩子荡秋千的画面了

Could you now?

35

37
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,350
我要过去
I'm going across.

38
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,190
今天琼·奥斯本
June Osborn was apprehended today

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,820
被我在无人区的一个小分队抓到了
by one of my teams in No Man's Land.

40
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,120
- 琼 - 不要
- June! - No!

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,000
我为我们的孩子祈祷 愿她们做得比我们好
I pray for our children. May they do better than we did.

42
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,430
你该不是要生了吧 你现在得去医院
Are you in fucking labor? You're gonna have to go to a hospital.

43
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,350
不行 他们会找到我的
No hospital. They're gonna find me there.

44
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,190
他很健全
He's perfect.

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,860
是个完美的男孩
He's perfect.

46
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,660
我们找到汉娜了
We found Hannah.

47
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,790
汉娜现在是一个象征了 你也是
Hannah's a symbol now. So are you.

48
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,630
你仍然可以来新伯利恒
You can still come to New Bethlehem.

49
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,510
琼·奥斯本还在惹是生非
June Osborn is still stirring up trouble.

50
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,720
是时候解决这个问题了
It's about time we fixed that problem.

51
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,800
{\an8}滚出去 政府已土崩瓦解 停止入侵

52
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,530
她不该是我们的目标 大主教
She's not a target, Commander.

53
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,900
枪响之后没有赢家 她也不例外
This is what happens in a fight. Everyone gets bloody.

54
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,130
住手 快住手 你在干什么
Stop! Stop! What the fuck are you doing?

55
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,410
基列想让她生不如死
Gilead wants her to suffer.

56
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,970
他们不会停手 我要你保证会护她周全
They won't stop. So I need to know that you'll protect her.

57
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,600
我很期待与您共事
I look forward to working together.

59
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,230
- 布莱恩 - 你差点杀了她
- Blaine! - You could've fuckin' killed her!

60
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,570
你永远都放不下她 是不是
You will never let go of her, will you?

61
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,080
我努力了 但我做不到
I tried, but I can't.

62
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,870
你以为你是谁
Who do you think you are?

63
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,920
我是弗雷德里克·沃特弗德的夫人
Mrs. Fredrick Waterford.

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,590
对我来说你只是一个荡妇
To me, you are just a whore.

65
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,010
请停车 拜托了
Please, stop! Stop, stop!

66
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,060
那个卡车司机 他死了
The man from the truck, died.

67
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,300
他们随时都可能拿到卢克的逮捕令
They could get a signed warrant for Luke at any minute.

68
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
我们得离开了
We have to run.

69
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,780
这个国家正在改变
This country is changing.

70
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,370
美国难民正在赶来的路上
American refugees are on their way here.

71
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,620
我们会让他们坐上去西边的火车
We're putting them on trains to go west.

72
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,040
- 我能让你们搭上一班 - 你先走

73
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,570
- 什么 不行 - 如果他们认出我来
- What? No! - If they recognize me,

74
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,720
你和妮可就都上不去火车了 走吧
they're gonna stop you and Nichole. So just go.

75
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,060
琼 我们会找到彼此 一如既往
June, we're gonna find each other. We always do.

76
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,690
你本来就没想上车 对吧
You were never gonna get on the train, were you?

77
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,530
班科莱先生 你被捕了
Mr. Bankole, you are under arrest.

78
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,340
没事 宝贝 没事的
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

79
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,180
我们会找到空位的
We're gonna find some place. Okay?

80
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,810

要不要坐到这边 亲爱的 来吧

谢谢你
Thank you.

92
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,370
- 那就坐这里吧 - 你饿了吗

93
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,420
抱歉 洗手间里排着长队呢
I'm sorry, there was along line at the rest room.

94
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,260
没关系 真的
It's a pleasure. Seriously.

95
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,150
我感觉这几天
I, um... I haven't been able to put him down...

96
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,440
他都没离开过我的手
in days, it feels like.

97
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,580
没人能帮我搭把手
There just hasn't been anybody else to hold him.

98
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,340
但现在我们安全了 可以休息了
But now we're safe, we can rest.

99
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,560
我得睡一会儿 我快累死了
Yeah. Well, I'm gonna get some sleep 'cause I'm fucking exhausted,

100
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,650
我的胳膊也痛得要命
and my arm is fucking killing me.

101
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,740
当然了 抱歉
Right, of course. Sorry.

102
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,410
你的手臂骨折了 肯定很痛
Um, your arm is broken. It must be quite painful.

103
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,460
你怎么弄的
How did you break it?

104
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,760
车祸
a car accident.

105
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,350
就在我家门口 一辆车从我身上轧了过去
A car ran over me in front of my house.

106
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,610
不是吧 什么时候

107
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,190
昨天
Yesterday.

108
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,410
我没听错吧 昨天一辆车从你身上轧过去了
I'm sorry, a car ran over you yesterday?

109
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,170
是的 昨天早上
Yeah. Yesterday morning.

110
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,420
是辆卡车 不是轿车
It was a truck. It was not a car.

111
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,340
过马路勤看路
Always look both ways.

112
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,730
好吧 你真是个相当顽强的女人
Well, you are, uh... one exceptionally tough woman.

113
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,660
谢谢你
Thank you.

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,510
是基列国干的
It was Gilead.

115
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,100
他们想要我的命
They tried to kill me.

116
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,860
这么说他们看我俩都不顺眼
It seems they are unhappy with both of us.

117
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,330
我们不一样 但是...
Well, we're not the same, but...

118
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,130
敌人的敌人就是朋友
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

119
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,800
视情况而定
On a case-by-case basis.

120
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,560
现在你可以把一切抛之脑后了
Well, now you can put all of that behind you.

121
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,860
借你吉言 赛丽娜
From your mouth to God's ears, Serena.

122
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,870
自逃亡以来
Well, he's been smiling on us so far, since...

123
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,040
祂一直对我们眷顾有加
since we've been on the run.

124
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,210
你干嘛说得这么浪漫
Why do you make it sound romantic?

125
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,300
我不是故意的 一直提心吊胆
That is unintentional. I don't think there's anything romantic

126
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,180
并无浪漫可言
about being absolutely terrified all of the time.

127
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,800
到了今晚
And by tonight,

128
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,830
多伦多和惠勒夫妇将会在千里之外
Toronto and the Wheelers will be 1,000 miles away.

129
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,630
基列国也是
And Gilead will be 1,000 miles away, too.

130
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,140
明天我们就能告别过去
Tomorrow, we can start to forget.

131
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,960
亲爱的 妮可
Sweetie. Nichole?

132
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,720
该死 完蛋了
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

133
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,390
亲爱的 妮可 不好意思 借过一下
Sweetie, Nichole? Excuse me. Excuse me.

134
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,520
妮可 你在哪里
Nichole... honey?

135
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,900
妮可 宝贝 不好意思
Nichole, sweetie? Excuse me.

136
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,490
- 没关系 - 该死 真见鬼
- Yeah, no problem. - Shit, shit, shit, shit.

137
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,120
妮可 宝贝
Nichole? Honey?

138
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,370

嗨 宝贝
Hi, sweetheart. Hi!

141
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,550
你醒了吗
Did you wake up?

142
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,800
是啊 你睡得正香
Ah, she did. You were still sleeping.

143
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,450
来吧 小宝贝
Come here, sweetie-pie.

144
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,470
找到你了
I've got you.

145
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,480
来妈妈这里 很好
Come here, come here. There we go.

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,690
好了 宝贝
There we go. Okay, sweetie.

147
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,740
别再这样了
Don't you ever do that again.

148
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,290
我担心你没有休息好的话
I was concerned that you might be ill-tempered

149
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,370
会影响情绪
if you didn't get enough rest.

150
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,500
我真傻
Silly me.

151
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,960
别碰我的孩子
Just keep your fucking hands off my kid!

152
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,090
听懂了吗
Do you understand me?

153
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,430
好的 我明白了
Okay. Yes, I understand you.

154
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,270
你觉得我会偷走你的女儿吗
What, you think I'm going to steal your daughter?

155
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,210
趁你睡着 像迪士尼反派那样
While you're sleeping, like some kind of Disney villain?

156
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,650
我真服了 琼 清醒一点
For God's sake, June, that's completely idiotic.

157
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,640
你还好吗 你脸好红
Are you all right? You look flushed.

158
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,800
我没事 这里太热了
I'm fine. I'm fine. It's just... it's hot in here.

159
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,130
别碰我
Don't touch me!

160
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,020
行行行 我从你包里拿了块米糕给她
Okay. All right, well, I gave her a rice cake out of your diaper bag,

161
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,310
希望你别介意
I hope that's okay.

162
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,980
当然了 根据你的剧本应该是颗毒苹果
I'm sure that you expected a poisoned apple.

163
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,280
不过她还是很饿
She's still hungry, though.

164
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,820
还有其他吃的吗
Is there any other food?

165
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,750
橱柜已经空了 但他们发了这些
I'm afraid the cupboard is bare, but they did pass these out.

166
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,830
宜应称颂
Praise be.

167
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,500
别在这里说祷言 会有人听到
Don't say that in here. Someone may hear you.

168
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,550
好了
Okay.

169
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,970
这些人是哪儿来的
Where did all these people come from?

170
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,870
大约六小时前 我们经过温尼伯
We passed through Winnipeg about six hours ago,

171
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,230
他们又挂了几节车厢 难民人数激增
and they added a lot more cars, a lot more people.

172
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,690
没有信号
There's no fucking service.

173
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,320
你还好吗
Are you all right?

174
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,990
不好 我们走吧
No. Okay, let's go, uh...

175
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,710
来吧 亲爱的 我们得找点吃的
Come on, sweetie. We're gonna go get some more food.

176
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,090
走吧 亲爱的
All right, honey. Okay.

177
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,840
我们又该去哪里呢 琼
And where is there to go, June?

178
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,180
你知道我们在行驶的列车上 对吧
I mean, you realize we're on a moving train, right?

179
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,100
这里肯定有非政府组织
There has to be an NGO... somewhere.

180
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,020
他们会有食物 说不定还有卫星电话
And they're gonna have food, and maybe a satellite phone

181
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,860
我要给我丈夫打个电话
'cause I need to talk to my husband.

182
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,780
- 好 - 不 不 你待在这里
- Okay. - No, no, you stay here.

183
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,250
你知道我们一起行动才更有胜算
You have to agree it makes sense for us to stick together.

184
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,290
赛丽娜 我们不是一伙的 明白吗
Serena, we are not together, okay?

185
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,100
请问这里有非政府组织车厢之类的地方吗
Excuse me, do you know if there's an NGO car or anything like that?

186
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,280
我不知道 他们说如果要领食物就去那边
Oh, I don't know. They said there was food that way if we wanted.

187
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,570
- 六号车厢 - 谢谢
- Car six, whatever that means. - Thank you.

188
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,460
但你未必能过去
I don't think you can make it through, though.

189
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,840
好了 亲爱的 我们要去找点吃的 好吗
Okay, sweetie, we're just gonna get some food, okay?

190
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,300
你会没事的
You're all right. You're okay.

191
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,400
好了
Okay.

192
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,970
慢点 你还好吗
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Are you okay?

193
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,300
- 别碰我 - 你不舒服
- Don't touch me, okay? - You're sick.

194
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,470
- 别碰... 把手拿开 - 好
- Get... just... hands off me! - Okay.

195
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,900
好吧 你待在这里
All right. Why don't you stay right here?

196
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,990
她还好吗
Is she okay?

197
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,470
我会给你换条干净的
...get you a clean one.

198
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,750
- 我保证 - 打扰了
- I promise. - Excuse me.

199
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,190
- 还好吗 - 这边
- All right? - Right here.

200
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,070
我给你找了个医生
I got you a doctor.

201
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,150
什么
What?

202
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,830
你好 怎么了
Hello. What's going on?

203
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,870
真是够了
Jesus Christ.

204
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,590
我没... 你有电话吗
I, um... Look, do you have a working phone?

205
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,350
我们来做个交易 只要你接受治疗
Let's make a deal. You let me treat you,

206
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,640
我就让你打电话
and then you can call whomever you want.

207
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,110
- 好吧 - 手臂怎么了
- Fine. - What happened here?

208
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,530
骨折了
I broke it.

209
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,860
看起来你近期
Ah, it looks like you had...

210
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,620
做过修复手术对吗
...some recent surgical repair?

211
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,910
她有的
Yes, she did.

212
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,560
或许你朋友能照看一下你的女儿
Maybe your friend could take your daughter for a moment.

213
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,460
- 好啊 - 不了
- Yes! - No.

214
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,390
你的缝线可能断开了
Uh, you've probably torn a few sutures.

215
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,980
我需要看看底下怎么样 很快的
I need to have a look under there. I'll be quick.

216
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,610
当然可以 我很乐意照看她
Of course, I'm happy to.

217
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,530
行吧
Fine. Fine.

218
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,990
宝贝 妈妈就在旁边 好吗
Okay, sweetie. Mommy's right here, okay?

219
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,790
- 对 - 好的
- Yeah. - Okay.

220
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:48,210
来吧 你好呀
Come here. Hi.

221
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,050
你能不能给她找块干净的尿布
Maybe you could find her a clean diaper or something?

222
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,430
当然可以 别紧张 琼 我不会离开
Yes, relax, June. I'm not going anywhere.

223
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,170
你的伤口感染得很严重
Looks like you have a nice infection boiling in here.

224
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,930
这就是为什么母亲和孩子应当受到照顾
Yeah, see, this is why mothers and children should be cared for.

225
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,470
我们是列车上最重要的人
We are the most important people on the train.

226
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,560
你等下也应该请布兰特医生看看
You should see Dr. Brandt next.

227
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,480
好 谢谢你
Oh, okay. Thank you.

228
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,490
好的
All right.

229
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,870
你好呀
Hey.

230
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,640
先生 沃顿大主教已经在等你了
Sir, High Commander Wharton's been waiting for you.

231
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,050
祈神保佑
Blessed day.

232
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,180
早上好 先生
Morning, sir.

233
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,310
真是个惊喜啊
It's a nice surprise.

234
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,070
我想应该好好庆祝你重获自由
Well, I thought we should celebrate your freedom.

235
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,000
她...
She's, uh...

236
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,010
她生我气是应该的
right to be upset with me.

237
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,060
萝丝生性敏感
Well, Rosie's always been sensitive.

238
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,810
但你们还有一辈子去寻找解决之道
But you two have a lifetime together to figure that out.

239
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,620
夫妻之间的事只有他们和上帝知道
What happens between a man and wife is between them and God.

240
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,330
我知道我需要
I know I need to, uh...

241
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,420
和劳伦斯大主教谈谈
talk to Commander Lawrence.

242
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,840
是的
Yes, you do.

243
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,720
我当时脑子一片空白
I wasn't thinking straight.

244
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,100
思绪混乱
Lost my head.

245
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,520
我会帮你好好解释的
I'll try and smooth it over with him.

246
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,160
其实我不怪你
Look, I can't say I blame you.

247
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,840
我们当中谁没受过诱惑
Who amongst us hasn't been tempted?

248
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,800
但你不觉得是时候放下那些幼稚的念头了吗
But don't you think maybe it's time to put away those childish things?

249
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,050
不论它们再怎么引人入胜 迷惑心智
No matter how fun and diverting they may be?

250
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,850
也该分清主次吧
Prioritize?

251
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,950
是不是该以家事为先
Prioritize what's best for you and your family?

252
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,030
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

253
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,420
抱歉 我听起来好像块幸运饼干
I'm sorry, I sound like a fortune cookie.

254
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,140
我想说的是 尼克
All of that is to say, Nick,

255
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,600
你拥有光明的未来
you have a bright future.

256
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,310
如果你能把握住
It's yours,

257
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,070
那么你将前途无量
if you take it.

258
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,860
谢谢你 先生
Thank you, sir.

259
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,700
我就知道你会明白
I knew you'd understand.

260
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,100
我要去俱乐部 看看能不能
I'm gonna go to the club, see if I can catch Lawrence

262
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,420
在劳伦斯打完前找到他 给你求求情
on the back nine. Plead your case a little.

263
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,220
我们今晚家里见
But I'll see you at home tonight.

264
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,310
您不回特区了吗
You're, uh, not going back to D.C.?

265
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,890
不了 我不在华盛顿
No, I think they can get by without me...

266
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,650
一时半刻也出不了问题
for a while.

267
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,410
我想多陪陪萝丝
I want to spend some time close to Rose.

268
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,040
我要有孙子了
I have a grandson on the way.

269
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,920
以家事为先 记得吗
Priorities, remember?

270
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,820
靠
Fuck.

271
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,960
你能把行李箱挪开吗
Could you move those suitcases out of the way there?

272
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,490
借过一下
Excuse me, guys.

273
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,620
不好意思
Excuse me.

274
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,970
你能腾出点地方吗 我们需要点空间
Can you make a little room? We could use some space.

275
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,830
感谢施惠 希望你可以理解
Beg your grace. I hope you can understand,

276
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,170
- 我们只是需要点空间 谢谢 - 好的
- we just need a space of our own. Thanks. - Yeah.

277
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,930
我过去拿包 来吧 朋友们
Yeah, I'll grab my bag there. C'mon, guys.

278
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,600
请坐这里 过来吧 好多了
Here, please. Come in. Much better.

279
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,980
瞧 我们现在有一块妇幼专区了
See, now we have a space for women and children.

280
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,400
你给卢克打电话了吗
Did you call Luke?

281
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,820
没有 我跟莫伊拉通过话了
No. I talked to my friend, Moira.

282
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,580
有什么消息吗 你丈夫怎么样了
Well, any news? What's going on with your husband?

283
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,540
他被逮捕了 好吗
He's been arrested, okay?

284
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,680
来吧 亲爱的 我们走
Come on, honey. Let's go.

285
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,440

喝点果汁好不好
Let's get some juice, huh?

287
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,790
真棒
There we go.

288
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,060
卢克在监狱里
Luke is in jail.

289
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,560
他为了保护我才遭到逮捕
He was arrested for defending me.

撞我的人死了
The man who ran me over died.

291
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,250
上帝的正义终将实现
God's justice will prevail.

292
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,720
卢克会在温哥华与你重聚
Luke will find you in Vancouver.

293
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,810
基列国将成为过去 你的家人会再度团圆
Gilead won't matter, and your family will be together again.

294
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,900
赛丽娜
Serena.

295
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,450
汉娜
Hannah.

296
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,710
汉娜 她还被困在那里 记得吗
Hannah. She's still there. Remember?

297
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,340
她被绑架了 依然是基列国的囚犯
She was kidnapped, and she's still a prisoner.

298
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,730

请原谅
Please forgive me.

302
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,750
好吧
Okay.

303
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,150
莫伊拉说我们不是去温哥华
Moira said that we're not going to Vancouver.

304
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,240
温哥华现在人满为患 他们不让火车进站了
They're overwhelmed, and they won't let the train come in.

305
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,370
好吧
All right.

306
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,290
那我们要去哪儿
Then where are we going?

307
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,090
她还不知道
She doesn't know yet.

308
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,720
我... 我也不知道
So I... I don't know.

309
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,320
但我知道我的丈夫不会在那里
But I know my husband won't be there.

310
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,700
祂会为你找到一条路 让你和家人重聚
By His hand, you will find a way to bring your family back together,

311
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,580
琼 那是你的天赋
June, that is your gift.

312
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,250
只要有一线希望 你总能找到出路
If it is at all possible, you will find a way.

313
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,310
我不知道自己是否还能独自面对一切
I don't know if I can be alone again.

314
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,730
那我们就一起找出路 我会帮你
Then we will find a way. I will help you.

315
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,450
我不需要你的帮助
I don't want your help.

316
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,330
我知道你不想接受我的帮助
I know you don't want my help. I realize that.

317
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,930
你不必非得接受我的帮助 我也理解 但是
And you don't have to accept it, and I understand that, too. But...

318
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,430
上帝希望我帮你
God would want me to help.

319
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,940
我必须这么做
I need to...

320
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,030
在经历了这一切之后
after everything.

321
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,880
好吧
Okay.

322
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,350
情况不容乐观
That's not good.

323
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,450
和奥乔亚上校确认后立即送出
Confirm with Colonel Ochoa, and send it first thing.

324
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,390
务必做到优先处理
Make it happen.

325
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,560
这就去办
Will do.

326
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,280
我不想等着预约
I'm not going to wait for an appointment.

327
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,780
整条街的电子眼 我一个不漏全调出来了
I got footage from every doorbell camera on the street.

328
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:46,040
卢克当时是在保护琼 他动手是出于自卫
Luke was protecting June, he fought the guy off in self-defense.

329
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,170
好吧
Okay.

330
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:51,260
知道了 我会负责协商 尽我所能
Um, I'll make the calls, do what I can.

331
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,180
是吗
Oh, yeah?

332
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,900
我也是这么回答那些难民的
How I say that to 100 refugees every day

333
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,690
可我明知自己无能为力
when I know I can't do a thing.

334
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,080
如今在加拿大做美国人实在不易
It's not a good time to be an American in Canada.

335
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,380
还真是头一次听说呢
No? That's news.

336
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,340
不是
No...

337
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,630
他们 呃
they're, uh...

338
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,640
准备关掉这里
getting ready to shut this place down.

339
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,270
整个部门一年内就会消失
This entire office could be gone in a year.

340
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,530
什么 他们怎么能这样做
What? How can they do that?

341
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,870
内阁希望与基列国关系正常化
The Cabinet wants to start normalizing relations with Gilead.

342
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:30,500
这意味着他们不再承认美国政府的合法地位
That would mean de-recognizing the United States.

343
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,930
我们不能就这么认输了
We can't just let them win.

344
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,660
我们军力透支
Our military's depleted...

345
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,120
已经无力抗衡
no match.

346
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,080
所以就这样了
So that's it?

347
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,630
我们不反抗了吗
We're done fighting back?

348
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,450
五月天还在反抗
Mayday's fighting back.

349
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,880
我以为你不会和五月天合作
I thought you didn't work with Mayday.

350
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,470
我们不剩多少朋友了
We don't have many friends left.

351
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,730
能并肩即是盟友
You find your allies where you can.

352
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,600
我想要帮忙
I wanna help.

353
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,030
我必须去帮忙
I need to help.

354
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,590
你肯定需要有人穿越边境 潜入内部
I mean, you must need people to cross the border, get inside.

355
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:57,260
我以前在荡妇俱乐部见过那些勾当
Shit, all that black market shit I saw when I was at Jezebel's, it's...

356
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:57,260
{\an8}基列国的地下俱乐部 供政权高层人物进行非法和堕落的活动

357
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,680
总得找法子进去
it's got to come in somehow.

358
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,270
什么 你... 你在那个俱乐部待过
What... you were... you were at Jezebel's?

359
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,030
没人能离开那个地方
No one leaves Jezebel's.

360
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,450
你怎么出来的
How'd you get out?

361
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,080
我宰了个大主教
I killed a Commander.

362
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,880
肃然起敬
That's something.

363
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,040
他们把我送去马大培训学校
They sent me to Martha school.

364
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,710
可惜失败了
Yeah, it didn't take.

365
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,220
他们把我当球踢来踢去
They kicked me around, and then

366
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,680
把我送到农业垦殖区
sent me to an agricultural colony.

367
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,270
至少我还有口饭吃
So I ate, at least.

368
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:46,110
上个月才被人从边境解救出来
Was liberated at the border last month.

369
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,450
上帝的恩典与你同在
God's grace was on you.

370
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,660
救我的可不是上帝
It wasn't God,

371
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,910
我们有个机智过人 心怀热忱的医生
we had a really smart doctor who gave a shit.

372
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,370
我相信这也是上帝的恩典
Well, I'm sure that was God's grace as well.

373
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,930
女士 我在荡妇俱乐部待了十七个月
I was in a Jezebel's for 17 months, ma'am.

374
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,390
上帝只是男人使用两样东西的借口
God is just an excuse for men to use two things,

375
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,480
屌和枪
cocks and guns.

376
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,570
自钱德拉两岁后我就再也没见过她
I haven't seen my Chandra since she was two.

377
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,280
我逃出来了 可我的小宝贝还在那里
I'm out, but my baby girl is still there.

378
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,500
感觉就像被人生生从身上挖走一块肉
It feels like a piece of your body is gone.

379
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,000
她们还活着 如果真死了 反倒痛快
They aren't gone. If they were gone, it would be easier.

380
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,220
不
No.

381
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,520
不是这样的
No. That's not true.

382
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,230
我真的很抱歉
Well, I'm so sorry.

383
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,490
看来我们这里的每个人 或多或少
It seems like all of us here, at some point or another,

384
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:32,410
都曾经受暴力牵连
were a part of some kind of violence.

385
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,750
是啊 你说得对
Yeah, you're right.

386
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,880
是啊
Yeah.

387
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,060
我的女儿 汉娜 是在森林里被抓的
My daughter, Hannah, was captured in the forest.

388
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,650
卫士将我们逼离公路
The Guardians ran us off the road,

389
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,320
他们穷追不舍
and they chased us down.

390
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,290
汉娜非常害怕
Hannah was so scared.

391
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,920
我也吓坏了
And I was terrified.

392
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,050
太可怕了
That's awful.

393
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,190
当时我们离边境只有半英里
We were only half a mile from the border.

394
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,950
但我无法跑得更快
I just couldn't... I couldn't run fast enough.

395
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,750
别这么说
Don't say that.

396
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,590
他们可是武装士兵
They were soldiers.

397
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,380
我是她妈妈
I'm her mom.

398
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:34,490
他们抓住我的时候 我还抱着她
And when they, uh, caught me, I was holding her,

399
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,330
他们硬生生把她夺走了
and they pulled her away.

400
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:39,290
他们拽着她 我...
They were pulling her, and I...

401
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,760
我松手了
I let go.

402
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,400
我松开了她
I let her go.

403
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,910
愿主治愈伤痛
May God heal you.

404
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,500
听到这些 真的很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

405
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,800
是啊
Yeah.

406
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,550
我也希望它能减轻我的痛苦
I wish that helped.

407
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,650
你感觉怎么样
How are you feeling?

408
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,200
好多了 谢谢
Much better, thanks.

409
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,870
我能看看吗
Can I take a look?

410
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,040
好 宝贝 来吧
Okay, sweetie. Come on.

411
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,370
你和那位旅伴的交情有多深
How well do you know your traveling companion?

412
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,170
我们认识有些日子了
Um, we've known each other a while.

413
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,630
但愿不是太久
Not too long, I'd hope.

414
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,010
是不太久
No, not too long.

415
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,810
她可不是你以为的那种人
I don't think she is who you think she is.

416
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,610
她是个难民
Well, she's... she's a refugee.

417
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,770
如果你知道她是谁
If you knew who she was,

418
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,060
你绝不会让她靠近你女儿
you wouldn't be letting her anywhere near your daughter.

419
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,620
我怀疑她是持伪造证件的战犯
I think she's a war criminal traveling under false papers.

420
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,920
等抓到她自然会查清楚
They'll make sure when they arrest her.

421
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,550
我已经联系了安全局
I talked to the security people.

422
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,260
他们正派警员前来抓捕
They're sending an officer to come and get her.

423
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,730
什么时候
When?

424
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,190
我想应该快到了
I think they're on their way.

425
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,700
她是咎由自取
It's what she deserves.

426
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,830
这还算是便宜她了
It's better than she deserves.

427
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,800
请答应我一件事
Just promise me one thing, okay?

428
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,470
答应我护她幼子周全
Promise me that we will keep her baby safe.

429
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,020
可以吗
All right?

430
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,290
我们的小家伙怎么样啊
And how are we doing?

431
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,580
挺好的 谢谢关心
I think very well, thank you.

432
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,170
让我来看看这位小绅士
Let me take a look at that young man.

433
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,890
好啦 好啦
There we go. Oh, there we go.

434
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,940
他们很珍贵 对吧
They're so precious, you know?

435
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,540
他看起来是个健康的小男孩
And he seems like a very healthy young boy.

436
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,920
没事的
It's okay.

437
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,670
宜应称颂 对吧
Praise be for that, right?

438
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,640
跟我说说孩子的父亲吧
But tell me about his father.

439
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,600
他死在战场了
Oh, um, he died in the war.

440
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,690
愿他的记忆成为祝福
May his memory be a blessing.

442
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,410
说起来 我在基列国是搞生育科学的
You know, in Gilead, I worked mostly in fertility sciences.

443
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,710
当然 实验室里全是男人
And it was all men, of course, in the lab.

444
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,130
是挺奇怪的
It was odd.

445
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:31,930
所以你自然会对造访的女性印象深刻
And you certainly remembered when there was a woman around.

446
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,350
我从未忘记
I never forgot.

447
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:37,570
可以想象 孩子该换尿布了
I imagine. Um, I think he needs a diaper change, actually.

448
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,280
马上哄好了
Almost done here.

449
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,620
大主教们常来参观实验室
And Commanders would visit the lab all the time.

450
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,130
偶尔 非常偶尔
Sometimes, rarely actually,

451
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,000
当他们对本所研究感兴趣时
they would bring their wives...

452
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,500
会带妻子同来
when they were interested.

453
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,760
他们会问出
Sometimes they asked...

454
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,810
相当高明的问题
the most intelligent questions.

455
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,400
请把我的儿子还给我
Please give me my son.

456
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,650
医生 孩子想要妈妈
Doctor, I think he misses his mommy.

457
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,250
他可真是...
He's really...

458
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,920
一个漂亮的男孩啊 沃特弗德夫人
a beautiful boy, Mrs. Waterford.

459
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,270
赛丽娜·乔伊
Serena Joy.

460
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,780
- 不可能吧 - 天呐 真的是她
- No fucking way. - My God, it's her.

461
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,240
该死的赛丽娜·乔伊
Fucking Serena Joy.

462
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,240
你怎么到这儿来的
How did you get on here?

463
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,370
她肯定伪造身份了
I bet she has fake papers.

464
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,960
她之前被关在多伦多
She was detained in Toronto.

465
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,590
- 是她 - 没错 我之前是在多伦多
- That's her. - Yes. I was in Toronto.

466
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:33,970
我希望我的儿子能够拥有自由 所以我离开了基列
I left Gilead because I wanted freedom for my son.

467
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,140
无人在意
Who cares?

468
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,180
这鬼地方是你亲手建立的
You built the fucking place. It belongs to you.

469
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,940
你休想瞒天过海 逃脱罪责
You're the rat that doesn't get to jump off the ship.

470
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,570
你这个鼠辈 你死定了
You're the rat that sinks!

471
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,400
嘿 别这样 冷静点
Wait, wait. No, no, calm down.

472
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,800
- 我怎么冷静 - 你可...
- Don't tell me to calm down. - Just...

473
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,910
那个该死的女人
That fucking bitch!

474
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,950
- 你能冷静下来的 - 你被洗脑了吗
- You're gonna calm down. - You brainwashed?

475
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,630
相信我
Okay?

476
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,980
- 她没资格站在这里 - 她抢走了我们的孩子
- She doesn't deserve to be here. - She stole our children!

477
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,340
她是罪人
She's a criminal!

478
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,640
- 她以为自己是谁 - 警察要来了
- Who does she think she is? - The police are coming.

479
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,190
她会被逮捕
They're going to arrest her.

480
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,820
我向加拿大边防局举报了她
I reported her to the DCBS...

481
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,350
- 什么 - 他们指派了警员过来
- What? - They're sending an officer.

482
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,160
- 他应该在来的路上了 - 不
- He should be on his way. - No!

483
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,460
不要举报我 别把我交给警方
No, please do not report me! Do not give me over to the police!

484
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,800
这点惩罚对你来说算轻的了
You are getting off easy.

485
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:18,560
琼 要是我在加拿大被捕
If... June, if I'm arrested in Canada, they will...

486
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,600
他们会把诺亚送回惠勒夫妇那儿
they'll give Noah back to the Wheelers,

487
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,900
我就再也见不到他了
and I'll never see him again.

488
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,570
琼 求你帮帮我
June, please, help me.

489
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,830
你怎么老是看不清状况
How can you be so fucking blind sometimes?

490
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,620
- 还指望别人帮你 - 她看得清
- Fucking help you? - She isn't blind.

491
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,290
- 但她该瞎 - 别这样
- But she should be. - Hey.

492
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,460
- 住手 - 我们应该割了她的舌头
- Stop it. - We can cut out her tongue.

493
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,090
- 好主意 - 说得对
- Great idea. - Yeah.

494
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,440
我们试试看吧 沃特弗德夫人
Let's see it, Mrs. Waterford.

495
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,560
够了
Enough.

496
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,560
他们砍了她的手指
They took her finger, all right?

497
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,730
她站出来了 他们就砍了她的手指
She spoke out, and they took her finger.

498
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,700
她已经付出代价了
She has paid.

499
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,780
- 她已经付出代价了 - 你怎么还在为她说话
- She has paid, okay? - How can you defend her?

500
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,620
她冷血无情 草菅人命
She threw people off fucking rooftops.

501
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,910
她配称为女性吗
Gender traitors?

502
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,080
这些债你怎么偿
How do you pay for that?

503
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,590
在基列国成立之前 美国已经是人间炼狱
Before Gilead, America was full of horrors.

504
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,760
- 别说了 赛丽娜 - 每一天都有女人被强奸 被杀害
- Serena, shut up. - Women were getting raped, and killed every day,

505
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,770
可是没有人在乎 那就是你们的国家
and nobody cared. And that was your country.

506
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,580
- 你在胡说些什么 - 你们根本无法生存
- What is wrong with you? - You were unfit.

507
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,960
- 你们的遭遇与我无关 - 你偷走了我们的孩子
- I am not responsible for your tragedies! - You stole our children!

508
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,110
我没有抢走你们的孩子
Your children were not taken from you!

509
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,030
我没有偷走他们 我是在救他们
They weren't stolen, they were saved!

510
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,390
赛丽娜 别说了
Serena, shut up!

511
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:10,760
- 她是强奸犯 - 美国背弃了上帝
- She's a rapist! - God hated America

512
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,420
所以上帝厌弃美国
because America turned their back on God.

513
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,590
于是祂将你们的国家抹去 天佑美国
And God took your country away. God blessed America!

514
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,320
- 赛丽娜 够了 - 她该经受业火焚烧
- Serena! - She should burn in hell!

515
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,000
警官
Officer.

516
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,200
你该庆幸 警察至少能保你平安
The police will keep you safe, safer than you deserve.

517
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,230
- 就是她吗 - 是的警官
- That's her? - Yes, officer.

518
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,150
赛丽娜·乔伊·沃特弗德
Serena Joy Waterford.

519
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,320
想必您拿到了逮捕令
I believe there's a warrant for her arrest.

520
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,290
- 你有证件吗 - 都是假的
- Do you have papers? - They're all fake.

521
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,970
她是个罪犯
She's a criminal!

522
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,970
她背叛了女性
She's a traitor to women!

523
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,410
这些看上去没问题
Yeah, okay. These seem legit.

524
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,760
不对
No.

525
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,870
给你添麻烦了
Sorry to bother you.

526
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,880
警官 等一等 听我说
No, no. Sir? Sir? No, officer? Sir? Listen to me.

527
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,630
- 这就是赛丽娜·沃特弗德 - 别说了
- This is Serena Waterford. Okay? - Stop it.

528
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,300
- 别说了 - 相信我 听我的
- Stop it. - Trust me. Trust me.

529
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,470
你闭上嘴
Shut up.

530
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,640
这是赛丽娜·沃特弗德
This is Serena Waterford.

531
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:06,060
- 在基列国的时候 - 琼

532
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,650
- 我是她的使女 - 我不理解 她侵犯了你
- ...in Gilead. - Jesus fucking Christ. She raped you.

533
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,160
你必须逮捕她
And you have to arrest her. Okay?

534
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,200
求你了 警官
Please, sir.

535
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,830
你必须把她和孩子从这儿带走
You have to take her and the baby out of here.

536
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,300
就是她
All right? This is her.

537
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,670
请你逮捕她
You have to arrest her.

538
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,050
听我的 赛丽娜
Just trust me, Serena.

539
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,640
她在想些什么
What's wrong with her?

540
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,560
女士 你有个漂亮的孩子
You have a beautiful baby, ma'am.

544
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,430
如果他还活着 也快十一岁了
He'd be almost 11.

545
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,610
你并不是赛丽娜·乔伊
You look nothing like Serena Joy.

546
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,040
打扰了 女士们
Sorry for the interruption, ladies.

547

- 警官 你不能就这么走了 - 警官

00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,670
警官
Sir? Sir?

想离开的人 现在可以走了

It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Back off. It's okay.

557
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,740
你不会因此获得平静
This is not going to bring you any peace.

00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,140
- 你不该趟这趟浑水 - 走开

00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,840
不要这样做 不要这样做
Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Don't do this. Don't do this.

561
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,180
她不配有孩子
She doesn't deserve to have a baby.

562
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,100
下地狱去吧
Rot in hell.

- 把玻璃打碎 - 我做不到
- Break the glass! - I can't.

581
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,840
这是你唯一的生路
There's nowhere to go.

582
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,970
她们会伤害诺亚
They're gonna hurt Noah.

583
