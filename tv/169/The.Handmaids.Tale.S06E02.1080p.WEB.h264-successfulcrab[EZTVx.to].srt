00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,672
我看到了你在殖民地的照片
I saw a picture of you in the Colonies.

92
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:11,926
我以为
I thought...

93

你怎么活下来的
How did you survive that?

94
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,895
一个医生还是能派上点用场
Well, a doctor's useful.

95
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:31,696
他们叫我去照顾嬷嬷和守卫

他们囚禁了我们 杀害了我的朋友们

但我挺过来了
But I hung on.

98
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,088
能再见到你的念头支撑我咬牙走下去
With the hope that I might see you some day.

99
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,468
这念头又是从何而起
What made you do that?

100
00:09:56,887 --> 00:10:00,975
我了解你 也清楚是如何抚养你长大的
I know you. And I know how I raised you.

101
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:06,188
不管处境多么糟糕 我都坚信你一定还活着
And no matter how bad it got, I always had faith that you'd survive.

102
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,359
而现在 你就在我面前
And now, here you are.

103
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,368
妈 你是怎么逃出来的
How did you escape, Mom?

104
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,539
是军队救了我
It was the Army.

105
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,877
大概六个月前 他们解放了我所在的殖民地
They liberated my Colony about six months ago.

106
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,756
- 美国军队吗 - 对
- The US Army? - Yeah.

107
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,051
残余部队
What's left of 'em.

108
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:39,429
我被送到这里后一直在找你
I got sent here and I tried to find out about you.

109
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,098
但基列国封锁了阿拉斯加
But, you know, Gilead's cut Alaska off.

110
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,018
没有网络 没有手机 没有新闻
No Internet, no cell, no news. So...

111
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,355
我们每周能用五分钟公共电话
We have five minutes a week at the public phones.

112
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:52,317
如其他数百万人一样 我联系了能找到的
So I called every embassy, every refugee agency I could find,

113
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,152
每一个大使馆和难民署
along with millions of other people.

114
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:58,156
但这些求助都石沉大海 所以...
But I could never get through to anyone that could help me, so I just...

115
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,326
我只能下一周继续尝试
I came back the next week and tried again.

116
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,372
一次又一次 我能做的只有这些
And again and again. That's all I could do.

117
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:11,337
这个营地本应该是临时居所
This camp was, of course, meant to be temporary, but...

118
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,258
是去往下一程的临时歇脚点
You know, just a way station before moving on.

119
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,427
去哪里
To where?

120
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,097
阿拉斯加的某处
Somewhere else in Alaska.

121
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,808
夏威夷的某地
Or a spot in Hawaii.

122
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,478
关岛 候补名单长着呢
Or Guam. The waitlists are long.

123
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,775
夏威夷是个好地方
Hawaii would have been nice.

124
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,362
不 我想尽可能长久地待在这里
No, I wanted to stay here as long as I could.

125
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,782
为什么
Why?

126
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,159

我在等你
I was waiting for you and...

128
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,175
汉娜怎么样了
So, what happened with Hannah?

129
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,392
他们抓捕我的时候也带走了她
Well, they took her when they captured me.

130
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,353
他们把她交给了某对大主教夫妇
And they gave her to a Commander and a wife.

131
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,481
但她...她还活着
But, you know, she's... she's alive.

132
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,317
我...我见到她了
I've... I've seen her.

133
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,820

她...她很健康
She's... She's healthy,

135
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,534
十分美丽
and she's so beautiful.

136
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,911
天呐
Oh, my God.

137
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,499
我真的试过救她
And I have really tried to save her.

138
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,210
我真的拼尽全力了
I've really tried to get her out.

139
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,552
我几乎就成功了
I've gotten so close, so close.

140
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,182
但是...
But, you know...

141
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:54,023
但我最后一次见到她时 妈妈 她...
But, um, the last time I saw her, Mom, she, um...

142
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,824
她不记得我了 所以...
She didn't remember me, so...

143
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,495
亲爱的
Oh, sweetheart.

144
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,665
但没关系 她依旧美丽动人
But it's okay. She is still so beautiful.

145
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,184
你很坚强
Oh, you are tough.

146
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,943
但这还没有结束
But it is not over.

147
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000

00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,286
- 安全抵达 - 真的吗
- Yeah. - Yeah?

151
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,038
马克收到了火车到站的消息
Yeah, Mark got word their train arrived.

152
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,331
太好了 我们能给他们打电话吗
All right. Can we call 'em?

153
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,958
不行 那里没有手机信号
No, we can't. There's no cell service.

154
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,086
也不可能搞到手机 我相信她也在努力
And it's impossible to get to a phone. I'm sure she's been trying.

155
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,507
谢谢你救我出来
Hey. Thanks for getting me out, man.

156
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,010
感谢你做的一切
Like, thanks for everything.

157
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,803
我只是把你从拘留所捞出来
I got you out of jail.

158
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,222
依然在努力推进你的听证会
I'm still working on expediting your hearing.

159
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,892
那得花多久
How long's that gonna take?

160
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,268
大概三四个月
Three, maybe four months.

161
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,729
- 四个月 -四个月
- Four months - Four months?

162
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,190
他从一个变态手中救了他老婆
He saved his wife from a fucking psychopath.

163
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:03,568
而卢克是对加拿大公民实施犯罪的难民
And Luke's a refugee who committed a crime against a Canadian citizen.

164
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,362
也就是说我被困在这儿了
So I'm just stuck here.

165
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,783
我受不了这堆破事
I can't take this shit.

166
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,411
他们光天化日之下撞倒了琼
They ran June down in the street, man!

167
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,789
他们击落了你们的飞机 我救不了汉娜
They shot down your planes. I can't save Hannah.

168
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,000
那不是你的错
That wasn't your fault.

169
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,167
我不在乎
I don't care!

170
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,585
我女儿还在他们手里
They still got my daughter.

171
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,964
你知道他们会对小女孩做什么 对吧
You know... You know what they do to those girls, right? Right?

172
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,925
你知道他们会对小女孩做什么吗
Do you know what they do to those girls?

173
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,010
- 是吧 - 我知道
- Yes? Yes. - I do.

174
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,887
她每一天都在长大
And she's getting older every fucking day.

175
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,850
我不能坐以待毙 我得采取行动 我得...
I'm not gonna sit here and wait. All right? I gotta do something. So...

176
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,769
我该做什么
So what?

177
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,020
你说啊
So what?

178
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,315
- 五月天在采取行动 - 什么
- Mayday is doing something. - What?

179
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,318
等下 他们在做什么
Wait. What? What...What are they doing?

180
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,071
他们要查明是哪些大主教下令击落飞机
They want to identify the Commanders who shot our planes down

181
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,407
阻止你们和汉娜见面
and kept you from Hannah.

182
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,450
然后把他们都杀了
And kill them.

183
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,744
我加入
I'm in.

184
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,330
你根本不知道这代表什么
Wait, you don't even know what that means.

185
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,166
不重要 我加入
It doesn't matter. I'm in.

186
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,004
我要加入
I'm in.

187
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,852
那里没刷到
You missed that spot.

188
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,021
你拿着那个做什么 还给我
What are you doing with that? Give me those.

189
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,565
等等 你别动 是我让她拿的
Wait. No. Stop, I asked her to take those.

190
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,025
为什么
Why?

191
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,235
因为我想把它们放到地下室
Because I'd like to put them in the basement.

192
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,570
我们不是说好了吗
We talked about this.

193
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,363
这个房子别的都听你的
You can do whatever you want in the rest of the house,

194
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,073
但书房我说了算
but the study is mine.

195
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,201
是 但我们也说好要把房子布置得典雅宜居
Yes, but we also talked about making the house look civilized.

196
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,287
这很典雅宜居啊
And the house does look civilized.

197
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,164
但那堆东西很难看 它们毁了整个房间
But those are ugly, and they ruin the room.

198
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,376
这个房间存在的意义就是安置我的物品
The reason I have this room is so that I can keep my things in it.

199
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:46,797
祈神保佑 大主教
Blessed day, Commander.

200
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,343
- 嘿 小子 - 祈神保佑
- Hi, champ. - Blessed day.

201
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,431
请进
Come on in.

202
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,979
别动这些 拜托
Don't touch these, please.

203
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,900
我也好歹是个大主教
I'm a Commander.

204
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:15,116
你是来给我最后一击的吗 我要不要去拿护齿套
You come here to finish the job? Should I grab my mouthguard?

205
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,244
我是来给你提个醒
Actually, I'm just here to give you a heads-up.

206
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,538
我岳父正在来的路上
My father-in-law is on his way over.

207
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,000
听着
Look,

208
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,150
琼的事和我没关系
I had nothing to do with what happened to June.

209
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:35,345
想弄死她的心情我并不陌生
I'm very familiar with the feeling of wanting to run her over with a truck,

210
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,181
但这次不是我干的
but this time it was not me.

211
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,600
好吧
Okay.

212
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,020
你相信我吗
So, you believe me?

213
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,357
我们这事儿就算过去了
We can move on?

214
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,319
我相信你没有这个实力或者能力
I believe you don't have the power or the capability.

215
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,366
他来了
There he is!

216
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,451
约瑟夫
Joseph.

217
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,871
很高兴见到你
It's always a pleasure.

218
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,334
需要我当裁判吗
You guys need a referee?

219
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,421
不了 我们很好 尼克学会了情绪管理
No, we're good. Nick's learned how to control his anger.

220
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,632
我也掌握了躲避的技巧
And I learned how to duck.

221
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,384
我盯着他呢
I'm still keeping an eye on him.

222
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,100
你还是盯着新伯利恒吧
No, keep your eye on New Bethlehem.

223
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,472
我们快被申请表淹没了
We're drowning in applications.

224
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,726
这地方比布鲁克林任何一所幼儿园都难进
It's harder to get into than any preschool in Brooklyn ever was.

225
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,729
真替你高兴 约瑟夫
I'm happy for you, Joseph. I am.

226
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,399
它很离经叛道 但它建立在仁慈和宽恕之上
It was a crazy idea, but one built on mercy and forgiveness.

227
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,775
为此 我深表钦佩
And for that, I commend you.

228
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,111
谢谢你 加布里埃尔
Hmm. Thank you, Gabriel.

229
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,738
谁能想到经济学家也有心呢
Who knew the numbers guy had a heart?

230
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,115
那你就误会我了 我们会赚大钱的
Well, don't get me wrong. We're gonna make a lot of money.

231
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,743
通过新伯利恒的新贸易路线
The new, uh, trade route through New Bethlehem...

232
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,661
回报颇丰
Is paying off handsomely.

233
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,580
我们出售干净的水源和农产品
We sell clean water and produce,

234
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,624
进口汽车和电子产品 大家都会满意
import cars and electronics... Everyone's happy.

235
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,919
你是如何解决强硬派对安全问题的担忧
And how did you deal with the hardliners on their security concerns?

236
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,964
当他们意识到自己可以穿越边境
Their concerns evaporated the moment they realized

237
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,843
购买豪车名表 担忧就烟消云散了
they could cross the border and pick up a Mercedes and a Rolex.

238
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,472
- 我问个问题 - 请讲
- I have a question for you. - Shoot.

239
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,893
沃特弗德夫人在其中扮演什么角色
Where does Mrs.Waterford fit into this?

240
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,104
- 赛丽娜吗 - 对
- Serena? - Yes.

241
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,525
难道你不希望由她来欢迎基列国公民回家吗
Wouldn't you want her welcoming our citizens back home?

242
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:16,404
这想法不错
That's not a terrible idea, actually.

243
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,656
谢谢
Well, thank you.

244
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,242
你毕竟让她做了基列国的全球大使
I mean, Joseph, you made her our global ambassador,

245
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,746
但有些时日没听到她的消息了 这是为什么
but we haven't heard anything from her for a while. Why?

246
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:28,541
她还在惠勒家吗
Is she still at the, um... the Wheelers?

247
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,711
惠勒夫妇现在看来是个大问题
The Wheelers turned out to be problematic.

248
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,338
她又刚生了孩子
And she just had a child.

249
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,341
需要时间恢复 休产假之类的
She needs time to recuperate. Maternity leave and all that.

250
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,635
你懂的 产妇相关那些事
You know, lady business.

251
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,095
我又懂什么呢
Hmm. Well, what do I know?

252
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:44,100
但你至少希望她能在此参与外交访问吧
But I would think you would want her here for the diplomatic visits at the least.

253
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,561
- 不 - 啊
- No! - Whoa!

254
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,855
天 什么情况
Oh, come on! What the hell?

255
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,066
安吉拉 你怎么在桌子下面
Angela, what are you doing down...

256
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:56,111
内奥米 来把孩子带出去
Naomi! Come and get your child!

257
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,904
我们在开会呢
We're trying to have a meeting.

258
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,115
她只是个孩子
She's just a little kid.

259
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:03,077
来 叔叔抱
Hey, come here. Oh!

260
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:07,873
我们去找妈妈 离这个老古板远一点好不好
What do you say, we go see your mother and get rid of this Grumpy Gus here, hmm?

261
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,252
妈妈在哪儿呢
Where is she?

262
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,092
我们得把赛丽娜找回来
We need to get Serena back.

263
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:27,226
如果沃顿让你跳桥...
If Wharton asked you to jump off a bridge...

264
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,815
我会爬上最高那座桥 祈求上帝垂青
No, I'd find the highest one and hope for the best.

265
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,700
我们就不能...
Uh... Can't we just like...

266
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,946
非得让她掺合这些事吗
Do we have to drag her back into all this?

267
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,325
你知道她在哪儿吗
Do you know where she is?

268
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,580
不 不知道 我只是...
No. No, I just...

269
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,500
我去问问眼目 看他们是否有线索
I can talk to the Eyes. See if they have any leads.

270
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,754
好 找到她
Good. Find her.

271
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,382
是时候让赛丽娜回到基列国了
Time to bring Serena back to Gilead.

272
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,636
我不能待在这儿
Nah, I'm not... I'm not staying here.

273
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,472
我理解你想帮忙
Okay, yeah, I get why you want to help.

274
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,015
但没人知道你会遭遇什么
But who knows what you're getting into.

275
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,267
我们会小心行事
We'll be careful.

276
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,935
你家那边怎么了
Hey, what's going on with your place?

277
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:15,607
楼下那户人家今早被赶走 送去收容所了
Uh, well, the family downstairs got booted this morning and sent to a shelter.

278
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,318
他们只能把大半家当留在街上
They had to leave half their stuff on the street.

279
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,737
- 狗屎政府 - 是啊
- The fucking government. - Mm-hmm.

280
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,781
我知道下一个就是我
And I know I'm next.

281
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,908
我会帮你
I'll help you.

282
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,000
我们都会被赶出去 迟早的事 莫伊拉
They're pushing all of us out, so it's just a matter of time, Moira.

283
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:32,624
我可能会去一趟新伯利恒
I, um, I... I might visit New Bethlehem.

284
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,042
别去 丽塔
Rita, no.

285
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,087
他们或许有我妹妹的消息
They might have a lead on my sister.

286
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,964
我理解 但他们不值得信任
Look, I get that, but you can't trust them.

287
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,176
好吧
Okay.

288
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,427
- 是琼 - 我来
- Oh, this is her. - All right.

289
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,098
别跟她提我们要做的事 好吗
Don't say anything about what we're doing. All right?

290
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:48,849
喂 琼
Hey, June?

291
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,895
- 卢克吗 - 嗨
- Luke? - Hey.

292
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,773
等会儿 怎么会是你
What? Luke, what are you doing?

293
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,943
- 是卢克 你出来了 - 是的
- It's Luke! Luke, are you out? - Yeah, yeah.

294
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,695
- 马克帮忙找了关系 - 你开免提
- Mark pulled some strings. - Put her on the voice...

295
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:04,155
我把免提打开
I'm gonna... I'll put you on speaker. I'm putting you on speaker.

296
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,074
- 嗨 - 琼

你们好
Hi! Hi!

298
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,203
你和妮可都还好吗
How are you? How's Nichole?

299
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,540
她很好 妮可很好
Oh, she's, um... She's good. Nichole's good.

300
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,501
我们这儿...稍等 等一下
We're... We're here. But here, hold on one second, okay?

301
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,294
我想你们和她打个招呼
I want you to say hi to someone.

302
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,672
你好 卢克
Hello, Luke.

303
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,550
- 霍莉 是你吗 - 是霍莉吗 我的天
- Holly? - Holly? Oh, my God!

304
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,385
- 是莫伊拉吗 - 难以置信
- Moira? - Are you serious?

305
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,594
- 霍莉 - 你还好吗
- Holly! - Are you all right?

306
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:30,974
很好 别担心 她们也被我照顾得很好
Yes. Yes. And don't you worry. I'm taking good care of these girls.

307
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,642
我们打电话的时间有限
And listen, we don't get much time on these calls.

308
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,436
我们回头再聊
So I'll see you soon.

309
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:36,230
- 好吧 爱你 - 再见
- Okay, I love you! - Bye.

310
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:42,360
好 我等下就来
Okay. Be right there.

311
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,154
- 琼 - 是我
- Hey, June? - Hi.

312
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:48,616
居然是你妈妈 这真的太棒了
Your mom? That's fucking...That's amazing. That's so good.

313
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,410
是的 我知道
I know. I know. I know.

314
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:54,539
你和妮可 你们是坐火车到那儿的吗
And you and Nichole... You got there on the train all right?

315
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,083
是的 我们还好
Yeah. Yeah, we're okay.

316
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,377
我们没事的
We're okay.

317
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,047
琼
June?

318
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:02,756
怎么了
June?

319
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:04,091
你不会相信
You won't believe...

320
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,969
但赛丽娜也在火车上
You won't believe this, but Serena was on the train with...

321
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,138
她带着诺亚
with Noah.

322
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,974
等等 赛丽娜也在
Wait, Serena?

323
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:14,601
怎么会呢
How was that?

324
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:17,270
我不知道 我不知道他们怎么样了
Luke, I don't know. I don't know what happened to them.

325
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:19,023
所以...
So...

326
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,120
还有很多人在排队打电话
Anyway, I don't have much time.

327
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,153
现在什么情况
So can you tell me what's happening?

328
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,905
他们会撤销你的案件 还是...
Are they gonna dismiss your case, or...

329
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,157
不 我得等听证会结束
No, I've gotta wait for my hearing.

330
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,743
好吧 要等多久
Okay, how long is that?

331
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,453
- 好几个月吧 - 什么
- It's a couple of months... - What?

332
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:34,579
我知道
I know, I know.

333
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,165
- 马克有最棒的律师团队... - 靠
- Mark's got the best lawyers... - Shit!

334
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,542
我们这个案子论据充分
And we've got a really strong case. Yeah.

335
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:43,421
- 别担心 - 好吧
- So don't worry about me. - Okay, all right. Okay.

336
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:47,008
那我们只能等待了
Well, we'll just... wait.

337
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,135
我们等
We'll wait.

338
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,388
我们每周只能打一次电话 但我会打给你的
We only get one call a week, but I will call you.

339
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:53,807
下周我会打给你 好吗
I will call you next week. Okay?

340
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:55,934
好 你一定要打
Okay. All right. All right. You better.

341
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,145
我会的
I will. I will.

342
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:03,734
我很想你
I miss you.

343
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:08,864
我爱你
I love you.

344
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:12,743
我也爱你
I love you.

345
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,131
琼和妮可还好吗
June and Nichole safe?

346
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,842
她们坐火车到了阿拉斯加
Their train made it to Alaska.

347
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:17,767
已经加密过了
It's encrypted.

348
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,937
要是我打来的时候你没法接 之后尽快给我回电
If you can't pick up when I call, try me back ASAP.

349
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:28,986
以及 我们需要基列巡逻队
Also... we need the schedule of Gilead patrols

350
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:31,112
在标记区域的巡逻时间表
in the marked areas.

351
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,698
在无人区的吗
In No Man's Land?

352
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,868
为什么美国军方要了解我们的巡逻区域
Why does the US military need to know our patrol zones?

353
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,455
还是说五月天在谋划什么
Or is Mayday trying something?

354
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,041
五月天是什么
What's Mayday?

355
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,293
要知道 你们接受过准军事训练
You know, you ran through the paramilitary.

356
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:48,254
五月天那些人可没有
Those people you get from Mayday, they're not trained.

357
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,716
他们是老师 药师 优步司机
They're teachers and pharmacists, Uber drivers.

358
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,345
他们相信自由 想要复国
They believe in freedom. They want their country back.

359
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,555
那他们是毫无机会了
Well, they don't stand a chance.

360
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,599
卫士会抓住他们 把他们直接交给眼目
The Guardians will capture them and give them straight to the Eyes

361
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,394
或者当场枪毙
or just shoot them on the spot.

362
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,439
你还要让多少人飞蛾扑火
How many bodies are you gonna let them throw in the fire?

363
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,650
到底什么时候才是个头
When is enough, enough?

364
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,654
直到无人可战
When there's no one left to fight.

365
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:31,439
{\an8}两个月后

365
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:47,439
这是妈妈最喜欢的绘本之一
Ooh! This is one of Mommy's favorites.

366
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,983
多好呀
Ah, yes!

367
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:53,445
不过真是可怜人啊 她凡事都得亲力亲为
Poor thing, though. She had to do everything by herself.

368
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:54,738
没人帮她
No one to help her.

369
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:56,740
你敢相信吗
Yeah. Can you believe that?

370
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:58,616
你敢相信吗
Can you believe that?

371
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,412
我想我会信
Think I might.

372
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,210
它们长势喜人啊
Those are coming in nicely.

374
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,963
你今天摘了多少土豆呢 小家伙
And how many tomatoes did you pick today, little man?

375
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,967
他睡了一整天 一点忙没帮上
Oh, he was no help at all. He slept the whole day.

376
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:20,824
别踩到我的杜鹃
Don't step on my azaleas.

377
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:23,828
就只有一次 爸爸
Ah. It was one time, Dad.

378
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,247
就那一次
One time.

379
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,750
真高兴你回来了 我的小羊羔
Glad to have you home, lamb.

380
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,169
回来感觉真好
It's good to be back.

381
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,175
新书宣传怎么样
How's the book tour?

382
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:43,930
规模很小 但读者反应热烈
Small. But people seem to really be responding.

383
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:45,890
他们渴望改变
They're hungry for change.

384
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,100
渴望信仰
Faith.

385
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:48,769
我从布道坛上看到了信仰
I see it from my pulpit.

386
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:50,771
这是黑暗时日
These are dark days.

387
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,734
人们需要相信些什么
People need to believe in something.

388
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,903
我很高兴他们仰仗的是你
I'm glad they're looking to you.

389
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:00,905
咱们去弄点柠檬水吧
Now, let's go get some lemonade.

390
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,825
我想听听那个缠着你不放的男孩
I want to hear all about that boy who won't leave you alone.

391
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:06,786
他叫弗莱德
His name is Fred.

392
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:07,872
弗莱德
Fred.

393
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:24,805
劳伦斯把他的未来全都押在新伯利恒上了
Lawrence has completely tied his future to New Bethlehem.

394
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:26,974
还有你的未来
And yours.

395
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,312
我想他会说是基列国的未来
I think he'd say Gilead's future.

396
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:38,736
你知道为什么我们自称"雅各的子孙"吗
Do you know why we call ourselves "Sons of Jacob"?

390
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:38,736
{\an8}雅各 又称以色列 是以撒的幼子 犹太人的祖先

397
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:44,160
因为太多人没有真正的父亲 只能独自摸索前进
It's because too many of us had to make do without real fathers.

398
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,582
我知道令堂已经尽己所能
And I know your mother tried her best,

399
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:55,418
但她要离家工作 对吧
but she had to work outside the home, didn't she?

400
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:56,670
她喜欢她的工作
Well, she liked her job.

401
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:58,923
她当然喜欢
I'm sure she did.

402
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:03,000
没有哪个母亲会在餐馆后厨
No mother would choose to cook at a diner

403
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,760
和自家厨房之间选择前者
instead of for her own family at home.

404
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,894
我知道令尊是个很难相处的人
I know your father was a difficult man.

405
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,274
相当体面的说法
That's, uh... That's one way of putting it.

406
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,657
曾经是沃特弗德
Waterford.

407
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:26,909
如今是劳伦斯
Now, Lawrence.

408
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:32,790
你让这些男性尊长走入你的人生 成为你的向导
You've let these men come into your life and guide you.

409
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,545
我从未混淆过
Look, I've never been confused

410
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,923
他们在我人生中扮演的角色
about the roles they played in my life.

411
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:43,676
嗯...
Well...

412
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,387
你也快做父亲了
You'll be a father soon.

413
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:50,224
你会为自己的儿子树立榜样
And you'll set the standard for your son.

414
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,019
记住
And remember,

415
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,731
每一次做选择的时候
every choice you make,

416
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:00,776
问问自己在给儿子树立何种榜样
ask yourself what kind of example you're setting for him.

417
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,071
他会做何感想
How's he gonna feel?

418
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:09,410
这对他有益还是有害
Will this help him or hurt him?

419
00:31:17,752 --> 00:31:19,211
好好抉择 孩子
Make good choices, son.

420
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,465
这就是你需要做的
That's all you have to do.

421
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:27,678
你潜力无穷
You have so much potential.

422
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:50,051
您拨打的电话暂时无法接通
The person you are trying to reach is not available.

423
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:52,804
请在提示音后留言
Please leave a message after the tone.

424
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:55,224
嘿 亲爱的 是我 嗯
Hey, honey, it's me. Um...

425
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,852
我给你打过好几次电话了
I've tried you a few times.

426
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,353
我开始担心了
I'm starting to get worried.

427
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:01,604
所以
So...

428
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:02,982
你还好吗
Are you all right?

429
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,317
我只是想知道你的听证会是不是已经开过了
Uh, just wondering if you had your hearing.

430
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:09,404
我想可能是 但...
Thought maybe it'd happened but, um...

431
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:10,572
请快点 女士
Come on, lady.

432
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:11,698
好的
Okay.

433
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:13,325
你能不能
Look, can you please just...

434
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,952
下次尽量接个电话 好吗
Just try to pick up next time, all right?

435
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:19,414
因为打电话很难 我会一直打的 但...
Because it's really hard to call and I'm gonna keep trying, but...

436
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:21,625
好吧
Okay.

437
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,545
老天啊 我只希望平安
God, I just hope you're okay.

438
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:27,923
我们想你
We miss you.

439
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:29,717
我爱你
I love you.

440
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:51,197
瞧你专注的样子
Look at you.

441
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:55,159
上帝把你带来我们身边 真是幸事啊 瑞秋
We're lucky God brought you here to us, Rachel.

442
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:02,124
你知道我不叫瑞秋
You know my name isn't Rachel.

443
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,293
沃特弗德太太
Mrs. Waterford.

444
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,088
两个月前刚见面时我就知道了
I knew when I met you two months ago.

445
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,631
我读过你的书
I read your book.

446
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:11,300
不论如何 我都欢迎你
And I welcomed you here anyway.

447
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:15,096
噢
Oh.

448
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:20,684
我知道人们怎么看我做的那些事
I know what people think of the things that I've done.

449
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:23,854
你如何看待你做的那些事
What do you think of the things you've done?

450
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,359
我想为上帝的荣耀奉献自己
I wanted to serve the glory of God.

451
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:31,237
只是这样吗
Was that all?

452
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,702
可惜事与愿违
Well, it didn't go as planned.

453
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:39,954
形势急转直下
It went wrong.

454
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,040
情况失控了
All by itself.

455
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:48,337
是我错了
I was wrong.

456
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:51,173
那就亲手修正它
So, set it right.

457
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:54,301
你知道祂在看
You know He's watching.

458
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:04,645
我希望能有更多时间帮你打理玫瑰
I wish I had more time to tend to your roses, but...

459
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,398
可我真的太忙了
I've just been so busy.

460
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:18,743
有大事要发生了 爸爸
Something big is about to happen, Dad.

461
00:35:21,412 --> 00:35:23,622
我们将改变这个国家
We're about to change the country.

462
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:28,461
我们终于能践行上帝的圣言
We're finally living up to God's Word, and...

463
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:33,215
整个世界将成为新的伊甸园
and the whole world is going to become a new Garden of Eden.

464
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:37,011
就像你一直想要的那样
Just like you always wanted.

465
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:17,967
你还真是音信全无
You don't write. You don't call.

466
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:24,266
祈神保佑 约瑟夫
Blessed day, Joseph.

467
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:26,310
祈神保佑 赛丽娜
Blessed day, Serena.

468
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:29,187
内奥米
Naomi?

469
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:30,481
现在是劳伦斯太太了
Mrs. Lawrence.

470
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:33,608
这里不是基列国 大主教
This isn't Gilead, Commander.

471
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:34,860
您这是擅闯他人领地
You're trespassing.

472
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:37,071
我们并无恶意
We come in peace.

473
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:43,869
只需叨扰片刻
Just need a little of your time.

474
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,879
所以 现在有劳伦斯太太了
So... Mrs. Lawrence.

475
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,925
是啊 帕特南不幸离世了
Yeah, Putnam came to an unfortunate end.

476
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:01,762
我倒并不惊讶
I can't say that I'm surprised.

477
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:04,974
很惬意啊
Well, this is cute.

478
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:07,268
这里只有女人吗
It's only women?

479
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:10,979
这是一个互帮互助 侍奉上帝的社区
It's a community that supports each other and serves God.

480
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,605
男人总把事情弄得一团糟
Men make a mess of things.

481
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,608
你快无聊死了吧
You're bored outta your mind.

482
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:20,656
我希望你能来新伯利恒
I need you in New Bethlehem.

483
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:23,617
我需要赛丽娜·乔伊·沃特弗德
I need Serena Joy Waterford.

484
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:27,455
你说过像我这样的女人在基列国没有立足之地
You told me there was no place for a woman like me in Gilead.

485
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:31,125
要是你知道我错了 应该会很开心
You'll be happy to know it turns out that I was wrong.

486
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,044
新伯利恒不是你记忆中的基列国
New Bethlehem is not the Gilead you remember.

487
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:35,588
它更友善温和
It's kinder, gentler.

488
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,000
它是理想中的基列国
It's what Gilead could have been. 

488
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,630
是在你的协助下能到达的理想乡
It's what it could become with your help.

489
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:42,719
你会成为进步的代言人
And you would be the face of progress.

490
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,804
改革即将展开
Reform.

491
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:46,265
我能拍摄更多宣传照了
More photo ops?

492
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,185
拜托 赛丽娜
Come on, Serena.

493
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:53,855
你很清楚 我知道你远不只是个花瓶
You know that I know that you're much more than a pretty face.

494
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:55,815
你不是摆设 你会拥有真正的话语权
No, you'd have real influence.

495
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:58,193
我保证你能独立自主
I promise you. Independence.

496
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:01,071
我是个带孩子的女人
As a woman with a child,

497
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:03,240
你知道我会被强制再婚
you know that I would be forced to remarry.

498
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:06,284
在新伯利恒 女人们可以独立生活
Women can live on their own in New Bethlehem.

499
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:08,411
她们能阅读 写作 经商
They can read, write, do business.

500
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:11,207
原来女人能做好多事 真是令人惊讶
Turns out it's crazy what women are capable of.

501
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:12,792
是吗
Hmm.

502
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,836
我不确定 我在这里能感觉到上帝
I don't know. I feel God here.

503
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:18,713
在那里就感受不到了吗
Well, can't you feel him there?

504
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:21,340
我还以为上帝无处不在 如果不在就把祂带去呗
I thought God was everywhere. If not, bring him along.

505
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:23,386
做其他人的明灯
Show other people the way.

506
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:27,723
这不就是你的理想和使命吗 赛丽娜
Isn't that your true purpose, Serena? Isn't that your calling?

507
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:35,731
眼目知道你们在哪
The Eyes know where you are.

508
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,576
惠勒夫妇迟早也会知道
It's only a matter of time before the Wheelers do too.

509
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:56,876
慢着
Hold on.

510
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:59,462
你昨天和前天都来过了
You were here yesterday and the day before.

511
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,840
我打不通 好吗 情况紧急
I couldn't get through, okay? It's an emergency.

512
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:04,217
大家都情况紧急 排队等吧
Yeah. They're all emergencies. Wait in line.

513
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:09,305
拜托了 这是最后一次 我保证
Come on. It's the last time. Promise.

514
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:14,477
快接 快接 快接
Come on, come on, come on.

515
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:18,273
马克 我是琼
Mark. It's June.

516
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:20,151
我给你打电话是因为
I'm calling 'cause...

517
00:39:21,694 --> 00:39:22,695
你说
Mm-hmm.

518
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:29,325
- 你说五月天 - 是啊
- Mayday? - Yeah.

519
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:30,870
他们自愿加入了
They fucking volunteered.

520
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:33,246
他们要干什么
To do what?

521
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:35,081
我不知道 只知道卢克和莫伊拉
I don't know. And now, Luke and Moira

522
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:37,877
如今困在无人区 没人救得出来
are stuck in No Man's Land, and they can't get them out.

523
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:39,879
天呐
My God.

524
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:42,839
那你这又是干什么
Well, what are you doing?

525
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,883
美国大使馆的人会带我过去
The American Embassy's gonna fly me out.

526
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:47,761
- 我去帮忙救他们出来 - 你在说什么胡话
- I'm gonna help get them back. - What are you talking about?

527
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:49,722
你又不是什么间谍 又不是当兵的
You're not a spy. You're not a soldier.

528
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:52,641
呃 你可能对我干过的事儿不太了解 妈
Ah, you don't really know what I've done, Mom.

529
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:54,643
那就告诉我
Then tell me.

530
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:59,147
好 有一个大主教 他在跟美国人合作
Okay. There's a Commander, and he's working with the Americans now.

531
00:39:59,148 --> 00:40:02,360
他能帮忙 但是他最近一直不接美国打给他的电话
He can help, but he has stopped responding to their calls.

532
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:04,195
然后呢
So?

533
00:40:05,154 --> 00:40:06,238
我能让他开口
He'll respond to me.

534
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:12,411
他是妮可的父亲吗
Is he Nichole's father?

535
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:18,583
所以你是他的使女
So you were his Handmaid.

536
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:19,668
不 不是
No, no.

537
00:40:20,378 --> 00:40:22,129
他是我当时大主教家的司机
No, he was my Commander's driver.

538
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:26,926
司机都是眼目
Drivers are Eyes.

539
00:40:28,594 --> 00:40:31,055
他当时是眼目 现在是个大主教
He was an Eye, and now, he's a Commander?

540
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,353
好吧
Okay.

541
00:40:38,062 --> 00:40:39,355
你当时的选择是迫不得已
You did what you had to do.

542
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:42,899
但这个男人 你不能信任他
But this man, you cannot trust him.

543
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,402
这有可能是个陷阱 就是为了抓到你和妮可
This could be a trap to get you and Nichole.

544
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:47,195
不 不可能
No, no, no.

545
00:40:47,196 --> 00:40:48,947
尼克很爱妮可
Nick, He loves Nichole.

546
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:50,198
他真的 他很爱妮可的
He really... He loves Nichole.

547
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:52,534
他...不是那样的人
He's... He's not like that.

548
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:54,619
男人都一样
They're all like that.

549
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,787
都是禽兽
They're monsters!

550
00:40:55,788 --> 00:40:58,415
不 他不是的 他是例外
No, not him. No, not him.

551
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:00,667
你在自欺欺人
You're lying to yourself!

552
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:03,503
哪怕是我亲手包扎的伤员 我都知道他们是禽兽
Even when I was patching 'em up, I knew what they were.

553
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:05,714
那我该怎么做 我应该把他们扔在那不管吗
Right, so what should I do? Should I leave them there?

554
00:41:05,715 --> 00:41:08,883
让卢克和莫伊拉等着被抓 被毒打 被处决吗
Leave Luke and Moira there to get caught? Tortured? Executed?

555
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:10,844
一定有别的办法
There has to be another way.

556
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:12,179
没有别的办法了
There is no other way.

557
00:41:12,722 --> 00:41:16,517
唯一的办法就是亲自上场战斗 这是你教我的
The only way is to show up and to fight, which is what you taught me!

558
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:18,811
我说的是错的
And I was wrong!

559
00:41:19,353 --> 00:41:20,479
我为此失去了很多
I lost!

560
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:23,100
我放弃了那么多跟你相处的时间
I gave up so much time with you!

561
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,941
为此我悔不当初
And, God, do I regret it!

562
00:41:24,942 --> 00:41:29,654
你能做的只有好好活下来 然后才能保护你爱的人
All you can do is survive and protect the people that you love.

563
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:31,032
我现在就是要去保护他们
That is what I am doing!

564
00:41:31,574 --> 00:41:34,868
而你的这位大主教 这个尼克 他也是你要保护的爱人吗
And this Commander, this Nick, is he one of those people?

565
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,287
你根本...
You have...

566
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:39,350
你根本不知道我经历了什么
You have no idea what you're talking about.

567
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:42,042
你不懂 完全不懂
Not... No.

568
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:43,960
我知道我女儿睡了一个独裁上位者
I know my daughter fucked a Nazi

569
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,837
现在还要飞过整个国家去见他
and is running across the country to see him again.

570
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:48,758
- 你闭嘴 - 你想去是吧 可以
- Fuck you. - You want to go? Fine.

571
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:50,259
你要去就去
Go ahead.

572
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:52,802
但要把孩子留在我这
But leave that child here with me.

573
00:41:52,803 --> 00:41:54,805
为什么 你也要抛弃她一次吗
Why? So you can abandon her too?

574
00:42:02,897 --> 00:42:03,898
妈
Mom.

575
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:31,841
这桌饭菜看起来太美味了
Well, this just looks delicious.

576
00:42:31,842 --> 00:42:32,926

578
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:36,721
不用谢 我的餐桌欢迎所有人
Well, all are welcomed at my table.

579
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:39,892
你想说餐前祷告词吗
Would you like to say grace?

580
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:44,230
呃 我...
Um... I'm...

581
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:48,900
我比较喜欢默默祷告
I'm more of a pray-in-silence kind of guy.

582
00:42:48,901 --> 00:42:51,278
这种事情对我来说非常私密
It's deeply personal to me.

583
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:53,238
好吧
Okay.

584
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,323
劳伦斯太太呢
Mrs. Lawrence.

585
00:42:55,825 --> 00:42:57,326

谢谢你 主
Thank you, God.

589
00:43:07,837 --> 00:43:08,838

还有...呃...各种东西
And, uh... the things.

595
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:43,121
{\an8}出自《圣经·罗马书》第8章第28节和第30节

595
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:30,066
我们知晓 为了爱神的人
And we know that all things work together for the good,

596
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:31,568
就是按祂旨意蒙召的人
for those who love God,

597
00:43:31,569 --> 00:43:34,363
万事都互相效力 使他们得益处
for those who are called, according to His purpose.

598
00:43:35,531 --> 00:43:39,118
所召来的人 又称他们为义
And for whom He has called, He has also justified.

599
00:43:39,744 --> 00:43:43,121
所称为义的人 又使他们得荣耀
And for whom He has justified, He has also glorified,

600
00:43:43,122 --> 00:43:53,799
{\an8}源于《耶利米书》第29章第11节和第14节的内容

600
00:43:43,122 --> 00:43:46,208
因为祂赐下盼望和未来
for He gives us hope and a future.

601
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:50,253
祂将我们从流放之地汇聚起来
He gathers us all together from the places He has banished,

602
00:43:50,254 --> 00:43:53,799
必使我们从流亡中归回
and He will bring us back from exile.

603
00:43:54,675 --> 00:43:57,803
- 阿门 - 阿门
- Amen. - Amen.

604
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:17,072
我想要感谢在座的每一位
I want to thank everybody here

605
00:44:17,073 --> 00:44:20,242
在我和诺亚一无所有 无处可去的时候
for welcoming Noah and I...

606
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,288
欢迎我们来到了这里
when we had nothing and nowhere to go.

607
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:29,667
你们打开了房门和心扉接纳了我们
You opened up your homes and your hearts,

608
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:33,339
你们的好意 我永远会铭记在心
and for that, I am forever grateful.

609
00:44:36,175 --> 00:44:38,928
但现在 我们该走了
But now it is time for us to leave.

610
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:44,809
主对我另有安排
God has a plan for me,

611
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:50,648
就像圣经中的以利亚 摩西 和诺亚一样
just like he did with Elijah, and Moses, and Noah.

612
00:44:53,275 --> 00:44:56,112
我不能再对主的安排视而不见了
And I cannot hide from His plan anymore.

613
00:44:59,448 --> 00:45:01,659
这世界正在崩塌 而我
The world is broken, and...

614
00:45:02,993 --> 00:45:05,246
我受天命将它愈合
I am being called to heal it.

615
00:45:30,604 --> 00:45:32,750
之前我每次打电话想找你的时候
Every time that I tried to find you,

616
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:34,275
听到的都是搪塞的说辞
I got the runaround or...

617
00:45:35,693 --> 00:45:38,612
或是答录机 或者干脆没人接
some recording or no answer at all, I...

618
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,157
那时候我会松一口气
I felt a little relief.

619
00:45:43,534 --> 00:45:46,494
因为如果没人知道你在哪 说明
Because if no one could tell me where you were, it meant...

620
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:48,414
你可能还在某个地方活着
You could still be alive somewhere.

621
00:45:51,584 --> 00:45:56,088
如果真的接通 有人告诉我你已经不在了...
But if I got through, and someone said you were gone...

622
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:03,512
相信你还活着 这份信念支撑我活到今天
Holding on to the hope that you were alive kept me going.

623
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:08,809
而你才刚刚回到我身边啊
And I just got you back.

624
00:46:11,437 --> 00:46:13,064
我不能再失去你了
I can't lose you again.

625
00:46:20,154 --> 00:46:21,572
我不是那个意思
I didn't mean what I said.

626
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:28,204
我知道你没有抛弃我
I know you didn't abandon me.

627
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:33,834
我知道的
I know that.

628
00:46:39,048 --> 00:46:40,424
我知道你必须过去
I know you need to go.

629
00:46:42,009 --> 00:46:44,345
我也知道我当时不是一个很好的母亲
And I know I wasn't the mother I should have been.

630
00:46:45,763 --> 00:46:47,347
但求求你 琼
But, please, June.

631
00:46:47,348 --> 00:46:49,183
把她留在我这里吧
Please leave her here with me.

632
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:54,689
我保证 我会尽全力照顾好她
I promise you, I will take care of her with every fiber of my being.

633
00:46:57,233 --> 00:46:58,609
我当年没能照顾好你
I wasn't there for you.

634
00:47:00,611 --> 00:47:01,821
还有汉娜
Or Hannah.

635
00:47:03,906 --> 00:47:06,826
这次让我照顾她吧 求你了
Let me be there for her, please.

636
00:47:24,093 --> 00:47:26,554
好吧 不会很久的 知道吧
Okay. It's not for long, okay?

637
00:47:28,556 --> 00:47:30,890
我会过去那边
Because I'm gonna... I'm gonna go there,

638
00:47:30,891 --> 00:47:32,308
把他们救出来
and I'm gonna get them,

639
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:34,603
然后我立刻就回来 好吗
and then I'm gonna come right back. All right?

640
00:47:36,564 --> 00:47:39,692
我和妮可会一直在这里等你
And Nichole and I will be right here waiting for you.

641
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:41,861
好
Okay.

642
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:51,328
妮可
Nichole.

643
00:47:55,166 --> 00:47:56,167
妈妈
Mom.

644
00:47:59,378 --> 00:48:00,838
她出生的时候
When she was born...

645
00:48:04,633 --> 00:48:05,926
我给她起了你的名字
I named her after you.

646
00:48:08,012 --> 00:48:09,180
她的名字是霍莉
Her name is Holly.

647
00:48:13,184 --> 00:48:14,185
那才是她的真名
It's her real name.

648
00:48:40,753 --> 00:48:43,421
妈妈要出门一段时间 好吗
Mommy's gonna have to go for a little while, okay?

649
00:48:43,422 --> 00:48:45,549
但是我很快就会回来
But I'm gonna be back really soon.

650
00:48:46,133 --> 00:48:49,886
我会带着爸爸 还有莫伊拉阿姨回来
And I'm gonna bring back Daddy, and Auntie Moira,

651
00:48:49,887 --> 00:48:53,181
到时候我们全都和姥姥住在一起 好吗
and we're all gonna be here together with Grandma, right?

652
00:48:53,182 --> 00:48:55,934
喜欢吗 你真棒
You like that? Look at that.

653
00:48:55,935 --> 00:48:57,268
你想把它拿过来吗
You wanna bring this over?

654
00:48:57,269 --> 00:48:59,979
这是什么
What's that?

655
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,649
你想把它放上去吗
Oh, you wanna put that on there?

656
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:04,235
好了
There we go.

657
00:49:06,529 --> 00:49:07,654
真棒
Perfect!

657
00:50:10,529 --> 00:50:11,654
