00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,892
Unless I'm wrong,
which, you know, I'm not.

155
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,950
Hey, Sher.
Hey, Jimmy.

156
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,292
Hey, I'm goin' to art class.
You wanna be my model?

157
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,458
Yeah. Cool.
Good-bye, Adrian.

158
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,338
Bye.

159
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,412
Yes, I will help you.

160
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,221
What was he like
as a kid?

161
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,595
Uh, pretty much the same.

162
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,000
Careful. Smart.

163
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,937
Sad.

164
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,236
L... I don't think
people change really.

165
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,640
At least, I've never seen it.

166
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,044
I waited 10 years for
my husband to change.

167
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,180
Mr. Monk?

168
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,787
Mr. Monk?

169
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,191
Mr. Monk.

170
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,887
Let's... Let's come over here.

171
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:54,409
Strange. Fingerprints
but no palm prints.

172
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,960
There were two of them.

173
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:15,632
Housekeeper surprised them.

174
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,965
There was a struggle.

175
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,232
She pushes the alarm,

176
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,706
she hits her head
and falls here.

177
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,216
This painting...

178
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,262
Is it valuable?

179
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,424
Not really, except to me.

180
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,491
It's my great-grandmother.

181
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,129
Why would someone
do something like that?

182
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,974
Did you have spray paint
in the house?

183
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,443
No.
So they must've
brought it with them.

184
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,216
Thank you.

185
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,713
This is the housekeeper's blood.

186
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,824
So, they defaced the painting
after they killed her,

187
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,695
after the alarm sounded.

188
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:24,793
They risked everything,
they risked life in prison...

189
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,032
to deface
your great-grandmother?

190
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:35,673
I think that's why
they were here... to do this.

191
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,479
To draw glasses and a mustache?

192
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,577
And a little goatee.

193
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,763
She was your
great-grandmother?

194
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,564
Tell me about her.
Well, I never met her.

195
00:13:56,635 --> 00:14:00,662
She was a famous
suffragette. Went to jail
for the right to vote.

196
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:04,175
Maybe they were
making a statement.
You know, like a political thing.

197
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,447
You mean, they broke into the house,
and they beat a woman to death,

198
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,418
then defaced the painting
because they had trouble
with the 19th Amendment?

199
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,420
Yes.

200
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:19,252
I mean, no.

201
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,520
It's a mystery.

202
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,602
Okay.
It's my house.

203
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,896
Sherry.
Michael?

204
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,601
How did...
How did you get in?

205
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:40,304
It's still my house, Sherry.
At least, uh, technically.
That is not true.

206
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,145
You can't just come over, Michael.
It's... It's in the agreement.

207
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,411
It was on the news.
I had to come!

208
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,578
<i>I'm sorry about Gladys.</i>
<i>L</i>... <i>l</i>... <i>I really am.</i>

209
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,452
Are you okay?
Were you here?

210
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,582
I was in San Diego,
visiting my sister.

211
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,594
Ah, that's right.
I knew that.
Um,

212
00:14:56,662 --> 00:15:01,099
Captain Stottlemeyer,
this is my ex-husband,
Michael Norfleet.

213
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,932
Yes. We've already
spoken to Mr. Norfleet.

214
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,165
Adrian Monk
and Natalie Teeger.

215
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,141
Monk? From junior high?

216
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,144
That's right.
Sherry told me all about you.

217
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,578
About how you never
took a single gym class.

218
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,884
I had a note.

219

Animals. Did...
Did they take anything?

222
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,923
Michael, please, just leave.

223
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,928
Sir, she asked you to leave.

224
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:43,441
Yes, okay, I'm going.

225
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:48,276
But before I do...
Figured I'd save myself a stamp.

226
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:51,339
Here ya go.
Your monthly pound of flesh.

227
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,385
Mail it next time.

228
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,545
I'll pay for the stamp.

229
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,988
Yeah, well,
good luck on this.

230
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,693
See ya around.

231
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,430
Thank you.

232
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,711
How much do we have?

[Coins Rattling]

234
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,641
$18.25.

235

[Chuckles]
How do you do that?

236
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,056
I don't know.

237
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:36,221
[Chuckles]
It's kind of funny
raising money for a dance...

238
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,559
that neither of us
is going to.

239
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:44,225
<i>Uh, Leo, here's the thing</i>...
<i>You gotta pay for that.</i>

240
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:51,531
Mmm. Pay for what?

241
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,544
Where's your evidence, Columbo?

242
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,546
Leo, I'm telling Principal Thicket.
I'm not kidding.

243
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:59,050
You don't wanna do that, Sherry.
You'll be sorry. I mean it.

244
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,544
Are you gonna pay us or not?

245
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,591
Hmm.

It's only chocolate.

Here.
Thanks.

You should
carry these with you.

Now, that's a list of people
that have worked at her house
over the past year.

252
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,709
Do you recognize anybody?
No.

00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,983
Neither do we.

254
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:42,187
Monk, Natalie and Sherry
are downstairs waitin' for ya.

255
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,526
Oh, yeah.
They're taking the painting
to the museum.

256
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:48,828
A guy named James Duffy
works there as a restoration expert.

257
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,835
What, you're going with?

258
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,837
Yeah.
Well, keep your eyes open.

259
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,305
What? What do you mean?
It's just that your friend SherryJudd...

260
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:58,036
just got a homeowner's policy
worth a million dollars two weeks ago.

261
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,044
That's pretty convenient,
isn't it?

262
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:03,081
Well, that's ridiculous.
Y-You think she did it herself
for the insurance?

263
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,640
No, no. She was in San Diego
like she said, but she could've
hired somebody.

264
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,777
No!
No?

265
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,947
Well, she doesn't need the money.

266
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,924
I got a look at that alimony check.
She's getting 20 grand a month.

267
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,960
That's a lot of dough.

268
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,053
Thank you.
But, Monk,

269
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,965
you and I have put enough
rich people in jail to know that
a lot of dough is never enough.

270
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,765
They always want more.

271
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,966
Not Sherry.
You don't know her.

272
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,807
What?

273
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:38,009
It's just that I haven't heard you
talk about a woman like this...

274
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,017
for a long time.

What are you doing?

281
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,043
Mr. Thicket said I have to act
more like a gentleman.

282
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:15,576
He said that just before
he gave me two weeks' detention.
Thanks for ratting me out.

283
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:21,058
Well, you know, Leo, you were
stealing from the decorating
committee. Man.

284
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:24,527
Which means that you were really
stealing from everybody.

285
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:27,497
Relax, Charlie Brown.
I learned a lesson.
I'll never steal again.

286
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,434
For example, I'll never do this.

287
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:34,563
Uh, hey, Leo, that's mine.
Would you please give it back?

288
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,234
And I would never, ever
dip this into the toilet.
Please, not the toilet.

289
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,675
Not the toilet.
Come on, Leo.
Be cool, man.

00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,576
This is none of
your business, Jimmy.

Yeah.

Mr. Monk...

Maybe he could just
paint over it.

- Forget about the painting!

<i>Nobody else</i>
<i>could've opened it.</i>

549

The cash box was in her locker
because you put it there.

550
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,087
And I know how you did it.

551
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,562
Here's what happened.
You hired two men,
Travis Baptiste and his brother,

552
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,690
to break in to Sherry's house.

- We found this in Travis's wallet.

Anyone could've written that.

555
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:18,464
It's true. The letters are printed.
There's nothing special about them.

556
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,773
But look at the house number.
Look at the zero.

557
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,075
There's a little line through it.

558
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:25,081
<i>I noticed something yesterday...</i>

559
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,208

into my locker,

00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:30,015
<i>which, by the way,</i>
<i>wasn't very cool.</i>

My lock was set to zero.

562
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,888
I remembered that Sherry
always set her lock to zero as well.

563
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:41,394
<i>But the day before,</i>
<i>when Principal Thicket</i>
<i>found the cash box,</i>

564
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,558
<i>her lock was not set to zero.</i>

565
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:46,762
<i>This was all about the zeros.</i>

566
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:52,139
You don't see a zero
written like this very often,
but I saw four of them.

567
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,737
<i>The day before, when you were</i>
<i>writing Sherry's alimony check.</i>

568
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,747
I've seen other people
write zeros like that.

569
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:03,082
True, but how many of them
also know the floor plan
to your wife's house?

570
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:06,817
Here's what happened.
When you pretended to
help her with her books,

571
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,155
<i>you pocketed her lock</i>
<i>and replaced it with yours.</i>

572
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,060
It was a perfect plan.

573
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:15,098
<i>You took out the money.</i>
<i>Then, when nobody was watching,</i>

574
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:18,135
<i>you came back</i>
<i>and planted the cash box.</i>

575
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,636
<i>Then you put her lock</i>
<i>back on the locker.</i>

576
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,105
Why would I hire somebody
to break into her house?

577
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:26,337
- There's nothing
in there that I want.
- <i>[Monk] Ah, yes.</i>

578
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,971
The motive.
I knew it had something
to do with this painting,

579
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,845
but I just couldn't
figure out what.

580
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,944
Then, I remembered
how you resented
paying all that alimony.

581
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:40,354
I believe you called it
"your monthly pound of flesh."

582
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,358
Her alimony?

583
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,360
<i>You'd be paying her</i>
<i>alimony forever,</i>

584
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,295
unless she got remarried.

585
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:50,857
This wasn't about
stealing anything,
or hurting anybody.

586
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:56,636
This was about them.
You were fixing them up.

587
00:37:56,707 --> 00:38:00,541
He knew aboutJimmy.
I talked about him all the time.

588
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,171
You tracked him down.
And you got lucky.

589
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:06,341
He was single
and still living right here
in the city.

590
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:10,478
<i>[Monk] But you had a problem.</i>
<i>How were you gonna</i>
<i>get them together?</i>

591
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,488
You couldn't just call her.

592
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,717
You and Sherry
were barely speaking.

593
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,023
And she would have resented
any suggestion you made.

594
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:22,191
<i>So you played Cupid.</i>
<i>You hired Travis and his brother...</i>

595
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:25,064
<i>to break in to her house</i>
<i>and to deface the painting,</i>

596
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,195
a painting she loved...

597
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:30,399
one you knew
she would want restored.

598
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,908
You were betting that
eventually she'd bring it toJames.

599
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,241
<i>He is the best</i>
<i>art restorer in the city.</i>

600
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,746
They would discover
that they still had feelings
for each other.

601
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,611
And you were right.

602
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,690
Nice story.

603
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,919
You can't prove any of it.

604
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,928
You can't prove any of this!

605
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,487
Are you gonna believe Adrian Monk?
He's a freak. Ask anybody.

606
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:56,556
Let's empty out
all your pockets. Come on.

607
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:01,496
That's my money.

608
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:04,837
<i>Travis and George werejust</i>
<i>picked up this morning in Las Vegas.</i>

609
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,843
They will be here tomorrow.

610
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,436
And these boys are gonna talk.
I could promise you that.

611
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,811
Their fingerprints
were all over that room.

612
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:17,185
This money's from the bake sale.

613
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:19,950
That's my handwriting.
I wrote "good luck"...

614
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,221
next to "Honest Abe" Lincoln.

615
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:26,127
Why don't you and I
have a little talk in my office?

616
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,189
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

617
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,201
Nobody was supposed
to get hurt.

618
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:35,705
What was Gladys doing there?
It was supposed to be her day off.

619
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,775
Lieutenant Disher,
book him.

620
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:43,575
The crazy thing is,
it worked.

621
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,083
Congratulations, darling.

622
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:56,449
Thank you.
You're amazing.

623
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,204
You're still amazing.

624
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,617
Adrian.
Bye.
