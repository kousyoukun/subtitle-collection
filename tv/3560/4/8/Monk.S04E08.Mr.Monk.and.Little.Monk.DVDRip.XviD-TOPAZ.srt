1
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,979
<i>This is a real gun!</i>
<i>And I know how to use it!</i>

2
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,648
- You don't wanna do this!
- No, it's a real gun! No!

3
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,418
No, I do, and it works!

4
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:02,459
No! I do!

5
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,624
Get out!

6
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,072
- Let's get outta here!
- Wait, wait, wait.
We gotta do the thing.

7
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,306
<i>What thing?</i>
The thing!
The painting!

8
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,820
<i>Okay! That's good enough!</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>

9
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,693
Okay, this one is... okay.

10
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,399
This one-
This is good.

11
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,958
Okay, Mr. Monk, really.
You don't have to wash 'em.

12
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:54,166
They're just gonna get recycled.
They're just gonna get
all smushed together.

13
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,970
You may be right.
This one's still sticky.

14
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,034
We'll wash that again.

15
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,113
Are you gonna get that?

16
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,684
Natalie?

17
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,073
Hello.

18
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,472
Mr. Monk-

19
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,782
There's someone here to see you.
She says she's an old friend.

20
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,341
Sherry Judd?

21
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,354
Sherry?

22
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,914
Sh- She's here?
What does she want?
I don't know.

23
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,392
Who is she?

24
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,895
Someone I knew
in the eighth grade.

25
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,898
Is she here to apologize?

26
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,328
I don't know.
Well, tell her
it's too little too late.

27
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,238
No, wait! Uh-

28
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:05,903
Tell her about Trudy.
Tell her I married Trudy.

29
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,447
Tell her Trudy loved me.

30
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,278
Tell her how pretty Trudy was.

31
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,115
Uh, wait.

32
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,246
Tell her Trudy and I
went all the way.

33
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,258
Mr. Monk, I think
she needs your help.

34
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,765
With her homework?
No.

35
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:31,031
With a case.
We're all... grown-up now.

36
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,937
Oh, yeah. Right.

37
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,714
Uh, Sherry?

38
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:49,617
Hello. It's-
I'm Adrian... Monk.

39
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,782
Adrian.

40
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,224
Oh. You-You look great.

41
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,725
Um, y-you probably don't
even remember me.

42
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,668
Is that Trudy?

43
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,704
She was beautiful.

44
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,570
Um, Natalie told me
what happened.
I'm- I'm so sorry.

45
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,701
Thank you.
We went all the way.

46
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,372
Please. Won't you have a seat?

47
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,211
Can I offer you anything?

48
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,717
Um, we have
bottled water and, uh-

49
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,720
Pushin' the bottled water.

50
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:25,918
I'm fine, thanks.
Um, where to begin?

51
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,325
Uh, I've been living in Seattle.
Um, we just moved back
three years ago.

52
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,329
We?
<i>My husband and I.</i>

53
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,456
- Ah.
- Michael.

54
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,501
Um, we're recently divorced.

55
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,729
Oh!
I'm so sorry.

56
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,763
No, no, it's- it's-
It's for the best, believe me.

57
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,868
So, it's, uh, just been me
and my housekeeper, Gladys.

58
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,879
That's why I'm here.

59
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,711
<i>Sunday night, someone broke in.</i>

60
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,946
<i>I guess Gladys woke up.</i>
<i>Um, there must have been a fight.</i>

61
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,548
And, um,

62
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,558
they killed her.

63
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,060
Oh-
Oh, my God.

64
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,767
Are you okay?
No- I wasn't home.

65
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:12,794
Adrian, I'm the only family
Gladys had.

66
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,364
I just want justice, for her.

67
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:21,277
I- I wanna make sure that
the best people are working on this.

68
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:24,475
And I-I've been asking around,
and everyone says you're a genius.

69
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,044
But, of course,
I already knew that.

70
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:34,391
Adrian, um, helped me
out of a jam when we were kids.

71
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,261
- Oh.
- About, uh, what?
Thirty years ago?

72
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,426
April 12, 1972.
You remember?

73
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,493
I only remember the date.

74
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,538
And what everybody wore.

75
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,097
And what everybody said,
and what everybody did.

76
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,803
Here it is.
Westover Junior High, 1972.

77
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,812
Natalie, don't-
don't open that!

78
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,110
Natalie, put that back.
I command you.

79
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,786
<i>Sherry, you were so cute.</i>

80
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,151
Okay, now where is Mr. Monk?

81
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,747
Natalie!
Just close the book!
I mean it.

82
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,625
Natalie. Natalie.
Okay, that's it. You're fired.

83
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,686
She's fired.

84
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,095
No, that couldn't be me.

85
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,796
It says "Adrian Monk."

86
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,134
Oh! Oh.

87
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,834
Oh-

88
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,450
Adrian!

89
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,527
Mom, everyone's watching.

90
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,827
Here's your lunch.
It's cut into 10 little squares,
just the way we like it.

91
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,391
And your first aid kit.
And your toiletry bag.
Mom-

92
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,371
You'll thank me later.
Remember, don't share
your food with anyone.

93
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,875
Sit near the fire doors.
I'll pick you up at 3:04.
I'll be wearing an orange blouse.

94
00:07:56,943 --> 00:08:00,003
Mom, I know what you look like.
I'll be fine.

95
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,809
I love you, Mom.

96
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,544
What are you doing?
Right, sorry.

97
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:15,151
<i>Here he comes. He's like</i>
<i>the real-life Eddie Munster.</i>

98
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,322
He can hear you.
He won't even know
what it means.

99
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,388
I heard they don't
even have a TV.

100
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,593
<i>I heard his brother never</i>
<i>comes out of the house.</i>

101
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,434
<i>I heard they have to</i>
<i>memorize the dictionary,</i>
<i>one letter per month.</i>

102
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,236
I heard that they take
four showers a day.

103
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,765
Excuse me.

104
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,970
Oh. Hi, Sherry.

105
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:02,474
I, uh, wanted to thank you
for recommending that
rock-and-roll record.

106
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,705
It was very... groovy.
I didn't
recommend anything.

107
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:09,179
Yes, you did. You were
wearing a Led Zeppelin
T-shirt yesterday,

108
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,808
which is the same thing
as recommending them.

109
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,513
So, uh, I went out,
and I bought their record.

110
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:18,421
The, uh, "Stairway Up To Heaven"?

111
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,688
What did you think?

112
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,663
Well, you know, I haven't
actually listened to it yet.
We don't have a record player.

113
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,892
I assume it's excellent.

114
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,697
I mean, uh, groovy.

115
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:35,036
Yes, you can tell from the cover.
They look so... groovy.

116
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,803
Well, I gotta go.

117
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,811
You always turn
your lock back to zero.

118
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,575
I noticed that. I do that too.
So later it's easier to open.

119
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:46,243
Uh-huh.
Actually, there are a lot of
things we have in common.

120
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,454
"Things Adrian Monk
and Sherry Judd have in common."

121
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:56,586
You made a list?
"One, our lockers
are right next to each other.

122
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,823
Two, we both like
<i>The Patty Duke Show</i>."

123
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:02,265
Even though she has to be lying,
because they're supposed
to be identical cousins,

124
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,428
which is
biologically impossible.

125
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,097
"Three, perfect attendance records."

126
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:11,132
And, uh, four-

127
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,440
"Neither of us has a date
to the Spring Fling."

128
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,343
How do you know that?

129
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,474
I happened to catch a glimpse
of your weekly planner,

130
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:23,386
and I noticed that you have
a babysitting job lined up
for that evening.

131
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,892
Unless I'm wrong,
which, you know, I'm not.

132
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,950
Hey, Sher.
Hey, Jimmy.

133
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,292
Hey, I'm goin' to art class.
You wanna be my model?

134
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,458
Yeah. Cool.
Good-bye, Adrian.

135
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,338
Bye.

136
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,412
Yes, I will help you.

137
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,221
What was he like
as a kid?

138
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,595
Uh, pretty much the same.

139
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,000
Careful. Smart.

140
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,937
Sad.

141
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,236
I- I don't think
people change really.

142
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,640
At least, I've never seen it.

143
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,044
I waited 10 years for
my husband to change.

144
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,180
Mr. Monk?

145
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,787
Mr. Monk?

146
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,191
Mr. Monk.

147
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,887
Let's- Let's come over here.

148
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:54,409
Strange. Fingerprints
but no palm prints.

149
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,960
There were two of them.

150
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:15,632
Housekeeper surprised them.

151
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,965
There was a struggle.

152
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,232
She pushes the alarm,

153
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,706
she hits her head
and falls here.

154
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,216
This painting-

155
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,262
Is it valuable?

156
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,424
Not really, except to me.

157
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,491
It's my great-grandmother.

158
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,129
Why would someone
do something like that?

159
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,974
Did you have spray paint
in the house?

160
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,443
No.
So they must've
brought it with them.

161
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,216
Thank you.

162
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,713
This is the housekeeper's blood.

163
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,824
So, they defaced the painting
after they killed her,

164
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,695
after the alarm sounded.

165
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:24,793
They risked everything,
they risked life in prison...

166
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,032
to deface
your great-grandmother?

167
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:35,673
I think that's why
they were here- to do this.

168
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,479
To draw glasses and a mustache?

169
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,577
And a little goatee.

170
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,763
She was your
great-grandmother?

171
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,564
Tell me about her.
Well, I never met her.

172
00:13:56,635 --> 00:14:00,662
She was a famous
suffragette. Went to jail
for the right to vote.

173
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:04,175
Maybe they were
making a statement.
You know, like a political thing.

174
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,447
You mean, they broke into the house,
and they beat a woman to death,

175
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,418
then defaced the painting
because they had trouble
with the 19th Amendment?

176
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,420
Yes.

177
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:19,252
I mean, no.

178
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,520
It's a mystery.

179
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,602
Okay.
It's my house.

180
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,896
Sherry.
Michael?

181
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,601
How did-
How did you get in?

182
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:40,304
It's still my house, Sherry.
At least, uh, technically.
That is not true.

183
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,145
You can't just come over, Michael.
It's- It's in the agreement.

184
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,411
It was on the news.
I had to come!

185
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,578
<i>I'm sorry about Gladys.</i>
<i>I- I- I really am.</i>

186
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,452
Are you okay?
Were you here?

187
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,582
I was in San Diego,
visiting my sister.

188
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,594
Ah, that's right.
I knew that.
Um,

189
00:14:56,662 --> 00:15:01,099
Captain Stottlemeyer,
this is my ex-husband,
Michael Norfleet.

190
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,932
Yes. We've already
spoken to Mr. Norfleet.

191
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,165
Adrian Monk
and Natalie Teeger.

192
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,141
Monk? From junior high?

193
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,144
That's right.
Sherry told me all about you.

194
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,578
About how you never
took a single gym class.

195
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,884
I had a note.

196
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,255
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

197
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,225
They did that too?
Animals. Did-
Did they take anything?

198
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,923
Michael, please, just leave.

199
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,928
Sir, she asked you to leave.

200
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:43,441
Yes, okay, I'm going.

201
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:48,276
But before I do-
Figured I'd save myself a stamp.

202
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:51,339
Here ya go.
Your monthly pound of flesh.

203
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,385
Mail it next time.

204
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,545
I'll pay for the stamp.

205
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,988
Yeah, well,
good luck on this.

206
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,693
See ya around.

207
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,430
Thank you.

208
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,711
How much do we have?

209
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,641
$18.25.

210
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,047
How do you do that?

211
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,056
I don't know.

212
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:36,221
It's kind of funny
raising money for a dance...

213
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,559
that neither of us
is going to.

214
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:44,225
<i>Uh, Leo, here's the thing-</i>
<i>You gotta pay for that.</i>

215
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:51,531
Mmm. Pay for what?

216
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,544
Where's your evidence, Columbo?

217
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,546
Leo, I'm telling Principal Thicket.
I'm not kidding.

218
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:59,050
You don't wanna do that, Sherry.
You'll be sorry. I mean it.

219
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,544
Are you gonna pay us or not?

220
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,591
Hmm.

221
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,558
Leo, I'm telling.
I'm serious.

222
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,934
Here. It's okay.
It's only chocolate.

223
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:23,805
Here.
Thanks.

224
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,970
You should
carry these with you.

225
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:33,140
Now, that's a list of people
that have worked at her house
over the past year.

226
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,709
Do you recognize anybody?
No.

227
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,983
Neither do we.

228
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:42,187
Monk, Natalie and Sherry
are downstairs waitin' for ya.

229
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,526
Oh, yeah.
They're taking the painting
to the museum.

230
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:48,828
A guy named James Duffy
works there as a restoration expert.

231
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,835
What, you're going with?

232
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,837
Yeah.
Well, keep your eyes open.

233
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,305
What? What do you mean?
It's just that your friend Sherry Judd...

234
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:58,036
just got a homeowner's policy
worth a million dollars two weeks ago.

235
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,044
That's pretty convenient,
isn't it?

236
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:03,081
Well, that's ridiculous.
Y-You think she did it herself
for the insurance?

237
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,640
No, no. She was in San Diego
like she said, but she could've
hired somebody.

238
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,777
No!
No?

239
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,947
Well, she doesn't need the money.

240
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,924
I got a look at that alimony check.
She's getting 20 grand a month.

241
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,960
That's a lot of dough.

242
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,053
Thank you.
But, Monk,

243
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,965
you and I have put enough
rich people in jail to know that
a lot of dough is never enough.

244
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,765
They always want more.

245
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,966
Not Sherry.
You don't know her.

246
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,807
What?

247
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:38,009
It's just that I haven't heard you
talk about a woman like this...

248
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,017
for a long time.

249
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,625
<i>How did you get</i>
<i>all that chocolate out?</i>

250
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,494
My mom makes me keep
a backup shirt in my locker.

251
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,527
Listen, Sherry.

252
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,974
I, uh- I really like you-
<i>Hey, Judd.</i>

253
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,238
Here. Let me help.

254
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,245
What are you doing?

255
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,043
Mr. Thicket said I have to act
more like a gentleman.

256
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:15,576
He said that just before
he gave me two weeks' detention.
Thanks for ratting me out.

257
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:21,058
Well, you know, Leo, you were
stealing from the decorating
committee. Man.

258
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:24,527
Which means that you were really
stealing from everybody.

259
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:27,497
Relax, Charlie Brown.
I learned a lesson.
I'll never steal again.

260
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,434
For example, I'll never do this.

261
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:34,563
Uh, hey, Leo, that's mine.
Would you please give it back?

262
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,234
And I would never, ever
dip this into the toilet.
Please, not the toilet.

263
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,675
Not the toilet.
Come on, Leo.
Be cool, man.

264
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,576
This is none of
your business, Jimmy.

265
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,514
I'm just sayin' there's already
enough bad vibes in the world.

266
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,551
We don't have to add to it.

267
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:49,416
Come on. Give it back.

268
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,422
What would Mick Jagger do?

269
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,116
<i>He'd give it back,</i>
<i>wouldn't he?</i>

270
00:19:56,495 --> 00:20:00,261
Here.
This isn't over.

271
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,098
So, what's the name
of that dance?

272
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,228
The Spring Fling.

273
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,172
It sounds stupid,

274
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:12,176
but if you wanna go, I'll go.

275
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,643
Yeah. That'd be cool.

276
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,121
<i>Are you okay?</i>
<i>Oh, I'm fine.</i>

277
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:31,094
Are you sure? Because I could
get Natalie to carry it.

278
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,092
Hello. We have
an appointment with,

279
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,603
um, James Duffy,
Art Restoration?

280
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,900
Sure. He'll meet you
in the main gallery.
Thank you.

281
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,273
Mr. Monk.

282
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,277
Mr. Monk, can I
give you some advice?
Yeah.

283
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,779
And I'm only saying this
to you as a friend.

284
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,839
As someone who's dated.
A lot.

285
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,818
What?
Some wine spilled.

286
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,821
Where?
Over there.

287
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,119
It's a painting.

288
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,285
It's driving me a little crazy.

289
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,488
Then don't look at it.

290
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:07,396
Okay, it's about Sherry.
I've been watching you,
and I-

291
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,559
I can't not look.

292
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,804
Maybe they could fix it. This guy
we're seeing restores art, right?
Mr. Monk-

293
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,604
Maybe he could just
paint over it.

294
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,475
- Turn that a little-
- Forget about the painting!

295
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:24,811
I think you should ask her out.
Take her to dinner.

296
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:27,443
Sherry? No.
No, I can't.

297
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,987
Yes, you can.
I know you want to.

298
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:33,149
I do?
Yes, you want to.
Trust me on this.

299
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,659
What about Trudy?
I'm a married man.

300
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,855
Oh, Mr. Monk,
it's... not really a date.

301
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,160
You're old friends, right?
You're just catching up.

302
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,167
Mr. Monk, she likes you.

303
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,328
No. There's no way.

304
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,338
Why not?
She knows me.

305
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,340
Just think about this
for one second.

306
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,309
There are over 200
private detectives in this city.

307
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,845
But she came to you,
didn't she?

308
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,216
She likes you.

309
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,483
I'm not gonna
ask you again, Miss Judd.

310
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,992
I want you to open that locker.
This is crazy!

311
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:12,030
Principal Thicket,
I didn't take anything.
Open the locker.

312
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:20,000
- What's going on?
- Somebody stole
the bake sale money.

313
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,199
Mr. Thicket got
an anonymous note.

314
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:25,710
Whoever wrote it said they saw
the money in Sherry's locker.

315
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,079
That's impossible.

316
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,343
I-That's not mine.

317
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,217
<i>That's not mine.</i>

318
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,280
How did that get in there?

319
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,726
Where's the money, Sherry?
I don't know. I swear.
I didn't take it.

320
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:47,356
Well, how did this get in there?
Does anyone else know
your combination?

321
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,299
No.

322
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,303
Let's go.
To my office.

323
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,669
I think we need to
talk to your parents.
Back to class.

324
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,970
Everybody,
back to class!

325
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:20,429
I love this one.
Look at their faces.

326
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,763
I wonder what they're thinking.

327
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,496
She's planning to murder him.

328
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,973
What?
She's about to feed him
amanita mushrooms.

329
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,566
<i>You can tell by</i>
<i>the little white spots.</i>

330
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,908
<i>It's a deadly poison.</i>

331
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,074
Well, maybe she doesn't know.
Oh, she knows.

332
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,278
He's been hitting her.
She's swollen.

333
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,186
<i>See the bruises on her arms</i>
<i>and her left eye?</i>

334
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,349
She knows what she's doing.

335
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,625
Must be hard...

336
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:55,996
to be you,
to see everything.

337
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,503
It's awful.

338
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,313
Sherry-
Mm-hmm?

339
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,611
I was wondering-

340
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:14,811
Later, uh, when
we're done here,

341
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:19,653
if you're not too busy,
maybe, um, we could-

342
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:22,659
<i>You know-</i>
Hello. James Duffy.

343
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:26,288
<i>Hi. My assistant, uh,</i>
<i>told me you have a canvas...</i>

344
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:28,355
<i>that you need me to-</i>

345
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,163
Sherry?

346
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,863
Yes?

347
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,133
It's Jimmy Wagner.

348
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,607
Jimmy?
Yeah.

349
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:41,510
Oh, my God!
I don't believe this.

350
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,476
Adrian, can you believe it?
It's Jimmy Wagner!

351
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,383
<i>You still wear a flower</i>
<i>in your hair.</i>
<i>You look great.</i>

352
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:51,047
Oh, no, you look great.
You look great.

353
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,386
They both look great.

354
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,222
Oh. Oh, do you
remember Adrian Monk?

355
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:59,388
Yes, of course, Adrian.
Supersleuth. I read
about you all the time.

356
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,398
Jimmy!
Yeah.

357
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,400
Oh, and Natalie Teeger.
They're, uh-
Hi.

358
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:07,199
They're helping me out.
I've just had a terrible week.

359
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:10,332
Somebody broke into my house,
my housekeeper was killed.

360
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,275
I heard about that.
I am so sorry.

361
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,973
- I didn't realize that was you.
- Oh, well, it's confusing.

362
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:19,244
Sometimes I'm Sherry Norfleet.
I was divorced in April.

363
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,251
Oh.
Well, how about you?

364
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,719
Divorced. You know,
a lot of that goin' around.

365
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:27,087
Oh, and you changed
your name?
My mother remarried when I was 15.

366
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,422
Oh!
You-

367
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,428
You really look great.

368
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:37,458
So, I guess I should
take a look at the patient?
Oh. It's over here.

369
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,472
Oh.
You've come a long way
from tie-dyeing T-shirts.

370
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,475
Oh, I still do that
on the weekends too.
Don't tell anybody.

371
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:52,616
I remember this painting.
It was in your parents'
dining room.

372
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:55,414
- Yeah, that's right.
- Excuse me, Jimmy. Jim. Jim.

373
00:25:55,487 --> 00:26:00,049
<i>Uh, is there anything peculiar</i>
<i>about that spray paint?</i>

374
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,891
Uh, I'll have to run some tests.
But it feels like an oil-based
spray enamel.

375
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,294
You can get it at any
hardware store.

376
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:10,960
<i>So, uh, what do you think, Doc?</i>
<i>Is she gonna make it?</i>

377
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,971
She'll be fine.
I'll take good care of her.

378
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,707
Sherry, are you busy?

379
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:21,906
Yeah, I would- I would love
to show you my studio.
It's just around the corner.

380
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,948
I- I'd love that.

381
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,949
That sounds like fun.

382
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,254
You look great.

383
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:42,592
Sherry was here.
Cash box was here.

384
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:46,194
Leo comes in.
"Put that cupcake down."

385
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,632
Adrian Monk,
is that you?

386
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,370
You're not allowed in here
until after the dance.

387
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:29,413
Oh, I'm not here for the dance.

388
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,348
I'm trying to figure out
who stole the money
from the bake sale.

389
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:36,046
They said it was that girl.
The honor student, Sherry Judd.

390
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:39,921
Oh. I made these
for the after-party.

391
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,084
Here. Tell me what ya think.

392
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,430
Here. Here,
take this one.

393
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:58,909
It has 10 chocolate chips.
Exactly 10. Just the way
you like it.

394
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,743
You're an excellent cook,
Mrs. Ledskey.

395
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:08,251
It's a gift and a curse.

396
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:11,618
Here, I'll send some more
of these home with you.
For you and your brother.

397
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,215
I've got some boxes left over
from the bake sale.

398
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,688
Blue icing.

399
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:34,233
What is it?
It's a clue.

400
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:36,246
Oh.

401
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:42,849
I'm so sorry, Mr. Monk.
No. I'm happy for her.
They seem like a great couple.

402
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:46,049
Well, they're not a couple yet.
They will be.
She's gonna go out with him.

403
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:49,855
How do you know?
Oh, I noticed little things.
Like the way she said,

404
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,920
"Yes, I will go out with you,"

405
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,988
as she wrote her phone number
on his hand...

406
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:58,502
and didn't let go of
his hand for 27 seconds.

407
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,061
Natalie.

408
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:05,434
Look at his gloves.

409
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,775
- <i>Yeah, so?</i>
- No fingers.

410
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:13,606
You remember the handprint
on Sherry's wall?

411
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,488
They were bikers?

412
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,490
They were bikers.

413
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:24,590
<i>Captain. You know that list</i>
<i>of all the people...</i>

414
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:27,130
who worked at Sherry Judd's
house in the last year?

415
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:30,167
Yeah.
Cross-checked it against
registered motorcycle owners.

416
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,226
We got two hits.

417
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:35,101
Well, good. Let's take one,
give one to Monk.
Yes, sir, which one?

418
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:36,970
Doesn't matter.

419
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,334
Oh.

420
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,175
Just pick one.

421
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:53,250
One potato, two potato,
three potato, four. Five potato,
six potato, seven potato, more.

422
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,554
Randy.
A woman is dead.

423
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,255
Yes, sir.

424
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,729
My mother told me to pick the-

425
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:10,341
Hey.

426
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,342
You okay?
You look uncomfortable.

427
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,344
Why don't we leave?
No, Mr. Monk.
I'm fine.

428
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:20,373
Okay. But, uh, if you get uncomfortable,
you let me know, and we just leave.
Okay.

429
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:24,387
But w-w-wait. Or if you feel
like you're about to
get uncomfortable-

430
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:27,151
Mr. Monk, why don't we call the captain?
Just let him handle this.
No.

431
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:30,956
No, no.
We can do this.

432
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,766
Who are you
trying to impress?
Nobody.

433
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:42,006
Sherry.
No. Natalie,
I'm a private detective.

434
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:45,474
This is what I do.
I don't care what Sherry Judd
thinks of me.

435
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,376
She's just a girl who
sat behind me in homeroom.

436
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:51,540
Hey.
You alone?

437
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:55,518
No. I'm with him.
So you're alone.

438
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:59,148
You know what, buddy?
You don't wanna do this.
Just... back off.

439
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:09,699
Hey. How ya doin'?
We're lookin' for
Travis and George Baptiste.

440
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,065
Never heard of 'em.
Okay, let's go.

441
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:15,936
That's funny. 'Cause we heard
they're in here all the time.

442
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,280
Waiter, he's-

443
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:28,118
He's-

444
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,317
Excuse me.
Sir, there's no smoking.

445
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,469
It's okay.
<i>He</i> can smoke.

446
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,837
New rule.
No spazzes in the bathroom.

447
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,473
Okay, if I see any spazzes,
I'll tell them.

448
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:59,448
You're a regular Flip Wilson,
ya know that?

449
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,246
Where's the money, Leo?

450
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,913
What are you talkin' about, Monk?
Monk the punk?

451
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,922
<i>You took the money</i>
<i>from the bake sale.</i>

452
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,686
You put it in a cake box
so nobody would see you
leaving with it.

453
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,490
Hey. They found
the empty cash box, remember?

454
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:14,190
It was in your
girlfriend's locker.
Which was locked.

455
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,961
- You framed her.
- How?

456
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,367
Tell me. She's the only one
who knows the combination.

457
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:23,373
I don't know how,
but you did it.

458
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,205
- You're the guy.
- I'm the guy.

459
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:29,303
I'm the guy who's about to
stuff you in your own locker
and lock the door.

460
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,146
You, uh, lookin' for us?

461
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,157
Travis Baptiste?

462
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:44,456
Yeah, I'm Travis.
This is George.

463
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,895
Your neighbors said
we might find you here.

464
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,901
You guys did some roofing work
for Michael Norfleet last year?

465
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,302
Yeah, that's right.
I wonder why you're asking.

466
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,636
I wonder if you wonder.

467
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,370
<i>Where were you</i>
<i>Sunday night, Travis?</i>

468
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:02,709
- You a cop?
- Are you... the killer?

469
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,216
Whoa, whoa.

470
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,590
<i>Hit him!</i>

471
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,943
- Damn it!
- Time out. Time out.
Let me get that.

472
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,080
- <i>Mr. Monk, get back!</i>
- Broken glass.

473
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,351
<i>Get back!</i>
<i>Get back!</i>

474
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,393
Get down.
Get down.

475
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,932
<i>Guys, guys, guys!</i>
<i>It's the cops.</i>

476
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,342
<i>Come on! Let's go!</i>

477
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,404
Drop it!
Everyone on the floor now!

478
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,641
Officer. Officer.

479
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,085
Officer, I'm Adrian Monk.
I want you to put out an A.P.B...

480
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,990
<i>on two homicide suspects</i>
<i>that just ran outta here.</i>

481
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,927
Names are Travis Baptiste
and his brother George. Got it?

482
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,430
Yeah.
Mr. Monk, look.
He left his wallet.

483
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,625
109 Vinton Street.
That's Sherry's house.

484
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,998
Enter here.

485
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,231
Somebody must've
hired them.

486
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,843
What? Why are you
making that face?

487
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,005
Why are you smiling?

488
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,015
Stop it!

489
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,311
Kid, you all right?

490
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,982
Huh?
Adrian, are you okay?

491
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:56,652
He'll be scarred for life,
psychologically.

492
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,786
Nah, he'll get over it.

493
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:05,560
What did he say?
He said he solved the case.

494
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,570
He knows how Leo did it.

495
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,808
Mike Norfleet.
Captain Stottlemeyer
wants to see me.

496
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:20,245
Yeah, I know.

497
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,187
I gotta go.

498
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,894
Whatever it is,
I didn't do it.

499
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,090
Sherry? Captain?

500
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,656
What's going on?
Oh, good!

501
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,134
Ah, you fixed it.
It's as good as new.

502
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:41,671
<i>Sir, sir.</i>
<i>Please don't touch that.</i>
<i>That's evidence.</i>

503
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,866
W- Evidence of what?

504
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:47,240
Mr. Norfleet, you're under arrest
for the murder of Gladys Aquino,

505
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,245
your wife's housekeeper.

506
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,578
Son, this'll be a lot easier
on everyone if you just confess.

507
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,585
I know you took the money.
That's crazy.
It was in her locker.

508
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,587
<i>Nobody else</i>
<i>could've opened it.</i>

509
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,818
The cash box was in her locker
because you put it there.

510
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,087
And I know how you did it.

511
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,562
Here's what happened.
You hired two men,
Travis Baptiste and his brother,

512
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,690
to break in to Sherry's house.

513
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,929
- Ridiculous.
- We found this in Travis's wallet.

514
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,437
Anyone could've written that.

515
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:18,464
It's true. The letters are printed.
There's nothing special about them.

516
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,773
But look at the house number.
Look at the zero.

517
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,075
There's a little line through it.

518
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:25,081
<i>I noticed something yesterday...</i>

519
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,208
when you were stuffing me
into my locker,

520
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:30,015
<i>which, by the way,</i>
<i>wasn't very cool.</i>

521
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:33,056
My lock was set to zero.

522
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,888
I remembered that Sherry
always set her lock to zero as well.

523
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:41,394
<i>But the day before,</i>
<i>when Principal Thicket</i>
<i>found the cash box,</i>

524
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,558
<i>her lock was not set to zero.</i>

525
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:46,762
<i>This was all about the zeros.</i>

526
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:52,139
You don't see a zero
written like this very often,
but I saw four of them.

527
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,737
<i>The day before, when you were</i>
<i>writing Sherry's alimony check.</i>

528
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,747
I've seen other people
write zeros like that.

529
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:03,082
True, but how many of them
also know the floor plan
to your wife's house?

530
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:06,817
Here's what happened.
When you pretended to
help her with her books,

531
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,155
<i>you pocketed her lock</i>
<i>and replaced it with yours.</i>

532
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,060
It was a perfect plan.

533
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:15,098
<i>You took out the money.</i>
<i>Then, when nobody was watching,</i>

534
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:18,135
<i>you came back</i>
<i>and planted the cash box.</i>

535
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,636
<i>Then you put her lock</i>
<i>back on the locker.</i>

536
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,105
Why would I hire somebody
to break into her house?

537
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:26,337
- There's nothing
in there that I want.
- <i>Ah, yes.</i>

538
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,971
The motive.
I knew it had something
to do with this painting,

539
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,845
but I just couldn't
figure out what.

540
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,944
Then, I remembered
how you resented
paying all that alimony.

541
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:40,354
I believe you called it
"your monthly pound of flesh."

542
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,358
Her alimony?

543
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,360
<i>You'd be paying her</i>
<i>alimony forever,</i>

544
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,295
unless she got remarried.

545
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:50,857
This wasn't about
stealing anything,
or hurting anybody.

546
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:56,636
This was about them.
You were fixing them up.

547
00:37:56,707 --> 00:38:00,541
He knew about Jimmy.
I talked about him all the time.

548
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,171
You tracked him down.
And you got lucky.

549
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:06,341
He was single
and still living right here
in the city.

550
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:10,478
<i>But you had a problem.</i>
<i>How were you gonna</i>
<i>get them together?</i>

551
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,488
You couldn't just call her.

552
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,717
You and Sherry
were barely speaking.

553
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,023
And she would have resented
any suggestion you made.

554
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:22,191
<i>So you played Cupid.</i>
<i>You hired Travis and his brother...</i>

555
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:25,064
<i>to break in to her house</i>
<i>and to deface the painting,</i>

556
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,195
a painting she loved-

557
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:30,399
one you knew
she would want restored.

558
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,908
You were betting that
eventually she'd bring it to James.

559
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,241
<i>He is the best</i>
<i>art restorer in the city.</i>

560
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,746
They would discover
that they still had feelings
for each other.

561
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,611
And you were right.

562
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,690
Nice story.

563
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,919
You can't prove any of it.

564
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,928
You can't prove any of this!

565
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,487
Are you gonna believe Adrian Monk?
He's a freak. Ask anybody.

566
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:56,556
Let's empty out
all your pockets. Come on.

567
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:01,496
That's my money.

568
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:04,837
<i>Travis and George were just</i>
<i>picked up this morning in Las Vegas.</i>

569
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,843
They will be here tomorrow.

570
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,436
And these boys are gonna talk.
I could promise you that.

571
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,811
Their fingerprints
were all over that room.

572
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:17,185
This money's from the bake sale.

573
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:19,950
That's my handwriting.
I wrote "good luck"...

574
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,221
next to "Honest Abe" Lincoln.

575
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:26,127
Why don't you and I
have a little talk in my office?

576
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,189
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

577
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,201
Nobody was supposed
to get hurt.

578
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:35,705
What was Gladys doing there?
It was supposed to be her day off.

579
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,775
Lieutenant Disher,
book him.

580
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:43,575
The crazy thing is,
it worked.

581
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,083
Congratulations, darling.

582
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:56,449
Thank you.
You're amazing.

583
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,204
You're still amazing.

584
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,617
Adrian.
Bye.
