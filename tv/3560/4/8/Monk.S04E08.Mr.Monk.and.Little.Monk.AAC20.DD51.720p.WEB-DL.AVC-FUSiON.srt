00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:29,879
Hey, Sher.
Hey, Jimmy.

156
00:10:29,957 --> 00:10:32,221
Hey, I'm goin' to art class.
You wanna be my model?

157
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:35,387
Yeah. Cool.
Good-bye, Adrian.

158
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,267
Bye.

159
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,341
Yes, I will help you.

160
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:05,150
What was he like
as a kid?

161
00:11:05,225 --> 00:11:08,524
Uh, pretty much the same.

162
00:11:08,596 --> 00:11:11,929
Careful. Smart.

163
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,866
Sad.

164
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:17,165
L- I don't think
people change really.

165
00:11:17,237 --> 00:11:19,569
At least, I've never seen it.

166
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,973
I waited 10 years for
my husband to change.

167
00:11:24,845 --> 00:11:27,109
Mr. Monk?

168
00:11:28,782 --> 00:11:30,716
Mr. Monk?

169
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:34,120
Mr. Monk.

170
00:11:34,188 --> 00:11:36,816
Let's- Let's come over here.

171
00:11:51,038 --> 00:11:55,338
Strange. Fingerprints
but no palm prints.

172
00:12:07,955 --> 00:12:09,889
There were two of them.

173
00:12:12,693 --> 00:12:16,561
Housekeeper surprised them.

174
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,894
There was a struggle.

175
00:12:18,966 --> 00:12:21,161
She pushes the alarm,

176
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:23,635
she hits her head
and falls here.

177
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:42,145
This painting-

178
00:12:43,257 --> 00:12:45,191
Is it valuable?

179
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:48,353
Not really, except to me.

180
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:50,420
It's my great-grandmother.

181
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:54,058
Why would someone
do something like that?

182
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:57,903
Did you have spray paint
in the house?

183
00:12:57,971 --> 00:13:01,372
No.
So they must've brought it with them.

184
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:06,145
Thank you.

185
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:12,642
This is the housekeeper's blood.

186
00:13:14,555 --> 00:13:18,753
So, they defaced the painting
after they killed her,

187
00:13:18,826 --> 00:13:21,624
after the alarm sounded.

188
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:25,722
They risked everything,
they risked life in prison...

189
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:28,961
to deface
your great-grandmother?

190
00:13:32,506 --> 00:13:36,602
I think that's why
they were here- to do this.

191
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:40,408
To draw glasses and a mustache?

192
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:42,506
And a little goatee.

193
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:53,745
She was your
great-grandmother?

194
00:13:55,247 --> 00:13:58,546
Tell me about her.
Well, I never met her.

195
00:13:58,617 --> 00:14:02,644
She was a famous
suffragette. Went to jail for the right to vote.

196
00:14:02,721 --> 00:14:06,157
Maybe they were
making a statement. You know, like a political thing.

197
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:12,429
You mean, they broke into the house,
and they beat a woman to death,

198
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:16,400
then defaced the painting
because they had trouble with the 19th Amendment?

199
00:14:16,468 --> 00:14:18,402
Yes.

200
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,234
I mean, no.

201
00:14:24,443 --> 00:14:26,502
It's a mystery.

202
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:32,584
Okay.
It's my house.

203
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:35,878
Sherry.
Michael?

204
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:38,583
How did-
How did you get in?

205
00:14:38,657 --> 00:14:42,286
It's still my house, Sherry.
At least, uh, technically. That is not true.

206
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:46,127
You can't just come over, Michael.
It's- It's in the agreement.

207
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:48,393
It was on the news.
I had to come!

208
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:50,560
<i>I'm sorry about Gladys.</i>
<i>L</i>- <i>l</i>- <i>I really am.</i>

209
00:14:50,636 --> 00:14:53,434
Are you okay?
Were you here?

210
00:14:53,505 --> 00:14:55,564
I was in San Diego,
visiting my sister.

211
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:58,576
Ah, that's right.
I knew that. Um,

212
00:14:58,644 --> 00:15:03,081
Captain Stottlemeyer,
this is my ex-husband, Michael Norfleet.

213
00:15:03,148 --> 00:15:06,914
Yes. We've already
spoken to Mr. Norfleet.

214
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:09,147
Adrian Monk
and Natalie Teeger.

215
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:12,123
Monk? From junior high?

216
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:15,126
That's right.
Sherry told me all about you.

217
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:17,560
About how you never
took a single gym class.

218
00:15:20,432 --> 00:15:22,866
I had a note.

Animals. Did- Did they take anything?

222
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:33,905
Michael, please, just leave.

223
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:39,910
Sir, she asked you to leave.

224
00:15:42,454 --> 00:15:45,423
Yes, okay, I'm going.

225
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:50,258
But before I do-
Figured I'd save myself a stamp.

226
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:53,321
Here ya go.
Your monthly pound of flesh.

227
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,367
Mail it next time.

228
00:15:55,434 --> 00:15:57,527
I'll pay for the stamp.

229
00:15:57,603 --> 00:16:00,970
Yeah, well,
good luck on this.

230
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:04,675

231
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:14,412
Thank you.

236
00:16:32,104 --> 00:16:34,038
I don't know.

237
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,203

It's kind of funny raising money for a dance...

238
00:16:38,277 --> 00:16:40,541
that neither of us
is going to.

239

<i>Uh, Leo, here's the thing</i>-
<i>You gotta pay for that.</i>

240
00:16:50,055 --> 00:16:53,513
Mmm. Pay for what?

241
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:55,526
Where's your evidence, Columbo?

242
00:16:55,594 --> 00:16:57,528
Leo, I'm telling Principal Thicket.
I'm not kidding.

243
00:16:57,596 --> 00:17:01,032
You don't wanna do that, Sherry.
You'll be sorry. I mean it.

244
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:05,526
Are you gonna pay us or not?

245
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:08,573
Hmm.

Now, that's a list of people
that have worked at her house over the past year.

Do you recognize anybody?
No.

Neither do we.

Monk, Natalie and Sherry
are downstairs waitin' for ya.

255
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:47,508
Oh, yeah.
They're taking the painting to the museum.

256
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:50,810
A guy named James Duffy
works there as a restoration expert.

257
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:52,817
What, you're going with?

258
00:17:52,885 --> 00:17:54,819
Yeah.
Well, keep your eyes open.

259
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:57,287
What? What do you mean?
It's just that your friend SherryJudd...

260
00:17:57,356 --> 00:18:00,018
just got a homeowner's policy
worth a million dollars two weeks ago.

261
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:02,026
That's pretty convenient,
isn't it?

262
00:18:02,094 --> 00:18:05,063
Well, that's ridiculous.
Y-You think she did it herself for the insurance?

263
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,622
No, no. She was in San Diego
like she said, but she could've hired somebody.

264
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,759
No!
No?

265
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:12,929
Well, she doesn't need the money.

266
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:15,906
I got a look at that alimony check.
She's getting 20 grand a month.

267
00:18:15,974 --> 00:18:17,942
That's a lot of dough.

268
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,035
Thank you.
But, Monk,

269
00:18:20,112 --> 00:18:24,947
you and I have put enough
rich people in jail to know that a lot of dough is never enough.

270
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:27,747
They always want more.

271
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,948
Not Sherry.
You don't know her.

272
00:18:33,525 --> 00:18:35,789
What?

273
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:39,991
It's just that I haven't heard you
talk about a woman like this...

What are you doing?

Mr. Thicket said I have to act
more like a gentleman.

He said that just before
he gave me two weeks' detention. Thanks for ratting me out.

00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:23,040
Well, you know, Leo, you were
stealing from the decorating committee. Man.

284
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:26,509
Which means that you were really
stealing from everybody.

285
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:29,479
Relax, Charlie Brown.
I learned a lesson. I'll never steal again.

For example, I'll never do this.

Uh, hey, Leo, that's mine.
Would you please give it back?

288
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:39,216
And I would never, ever
dip this into the toilet. Please, not the toilet.

00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,657
Not the toilet.
Come on, Leo. Be cool, man.

463
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:23,331
Okay. But, uh, if you get uncomfortable,
you let me know, and we just leave. Okay.

464
00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:27,345
But w-w-wait. Or if you feel
like you're about to get uncomfortable-

465
00:30:27,413 --> 00:30:30,109
Mr. Monk, why don't we call the captain?
Just let him handle this. No.

No, no.

W- Evidence of what?

544
00:35:47,742 --> 00:35:51,041
Mr. Norfleet, you're under arrest
for the murder of Gladys Aquino,

545
00:35:51,112 --> 00:35:53,046
your wife's housekeeper.

546
00:35:53,114 --> 00:35:56,379
Son, this'll be a lot easier
on everyone if you just confess.

547
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,386
I know you took the money.
That's crazy. It was in her locker.

548
00:35:59,454 --> 00:36:01,388
<i>Nobody else</i>
<i>could've opened it.</i>

549
00:36:01,456 --> 00:36:04,619
The cash box was in her locker
because you put it there.

550
00:36:04,693 --> 00:36:06,888
And I know how you did it.

551
00:36:06,962 --> 00:36:10,363
Here's what happened.
You hired two men, Travis Baptiste and his brother,

552
00:36:10,432 --> 00:36:12,491
to break in to Sherry's house.

553
00:36:12,567 --> 00:36:15,730
- Ridiculous.
- We found this in Travis's wallet.

554
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:18,238
Anyone could've written that.

555
00:36:18,306 --> 00:36:22,265
It's true. The letters are printed.
There's nothing special about them.

556
00:36:22,344 --> 00:36:24,574
But look at the house number.
Look at the zero.

557
00:36:24,646 --> 00:36:26,876
There's a little line through it.

558
00:36:26,948 --> 00:36:28,882
<i>I noticed something yesterday...</i>

559
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,009
when you were stuffing me
into my locker,

560
00:36:31,086 --> 00:36:33,816
<i>which, by the way,</i>
<i>wasn't very cool.</i>

561
00:36:33,888 --> 00:36:36,857
My lock was set to zero.

562
00:36:36,925 --> 00:36:39,689
I remembered that Sherry
always set her lock to zero as well.

563
00:36:40,895 --> 00:36:45,195
<i>But the day before,</i>
<i>when Principal Thicket</i> <i>found the cash box,</i>

564
00:36:45,266 --> 00:36:47,359
<i>her lock was not set to zero.</i>

565
00:36:47,435 --> 00:36:50,563
<i>This was all about the zeros.</i>

566
00:36:50,638 --> 00:36:55,940
You don't see a zero
written like this very often, but I saw four of them.

567
00:36:56,011 --> 00:36:59,538
<i>The day before, when you were</i>
<i>writing Sherry's alimony check.</i>

568
00:36:59,614 --> 00:37:01,548
I've seen other people
write zeros like that.

569
00:37:01,616 --> 00:37:06,883
True, but how many of them
also know the floor plan to your wife's house?

570
00:37:06,955 --> 00:37:10,618
Here's what happened.
When you pretended to help her with her books,

571
00:37:10,692 --> 00:37:12,956
<i>you pocketed her lock</i>
<i>and replaced it with yours.</i>

572
00:37:13,028 --> 00:37:15,861
It was a perfect plan.

573
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,899
<i>You took out the money.</i>
<i>Then, when nobody was watching,</i>

574
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:21,936
<i>you came back</i>
<i>and planted the cash box.</i>

575
00:37:22,003 --> 00:37:24,437
<i>Then you put her lock</i>
<i>back on the locker.</i>

576
00:37:24,506 --> 00:37:26,906
Why would I hire somebody
to break into her house?

577
00:37:26,975 --> 00:37:30,138
- There's nothing
in there that I want. - <i>[Monk] Ah, yes.</i>

578
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:33,772
The motive.
I knew it had something to do with this painting,

579
00:37:33,848 --> 00:37:36,646
but I just couldn't
figure out what.

580
00:37:36,718 --> 00:37:40,745
Then, I remembered
how you resented paying all that alimony.

581
00:37:40,822 --> 00:37:44,155
I believe you called it
"your monthly pound of flesh."

582
00:37:44,225 --> 00:37:46,159
Her alimony?

583
00:37:46,227 --> 00:37:48,161
<i>You'd be paying her</i>
<i>alimony forever,</i>

584
00:37:48,229 --> 00:37:51,096
unless she got remarried.

585
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:54,658
This wasn't about
stealing anything, or hurting anybody.

586
00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:00,437
This was about them.
You were fixing them up.

587
00:38:00,508 --> 00:38:04,342
He knew aboutJimmy.
I talked about him all the time.

588
00:38:04,412 --> 00:38:06,972
You tracked him down.
And you got lucky.

589
00:38:07,048 --> 00:38:10,142
He was single
and still living right here in the city.

590
00:38:10,218 --> 00:38:14,279
<i>[Monk] But you had a problem.</i>
<i>How were you gonna</i> <i>get them together?</i>

591
00:38:14,355 --> 00:38:16,289
You couldn't just call her.

592
00:38:16,357 --> 00:38:18,518
You and Sherry
were barely speaking.

593
00:38:18,593 --> 00:38:21,824
And she would have resented
any suggestion you made.

594
00:38:21,896 --> 00:38:25,992
<i>So you played Cupid.</i>
<i>You hired Travis and his brother...</i>

595
00:38:26,067 --> 00:38:28,865
<i>to break in to her house</i>
<i>and to deface the painting,</i>

596
00:38:28,937 --> 00:38:30,996
a painting she loved-

597
00:38:31,072 --> 00:38:34,200
one you knew
she would want restored.

598
00:38:34,275 --> 00:38:36,709
You were betting that
eventually she'd bring it toJames.

599
00:38:36,778 --> 00:38:39,042
<i>He is the best</i>
<i>art restorer in the city.</i>

600
00:38:40,281 --> 00:38:44,547
They would discover
that they still had feelings for each other.

601
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:48,412
And you were right.

602
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,491
Nice story.

603
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:53,720
You can't prove any of it.

604
00:38:53,795 --> 00:38:55,729
You can't prove any of this!

605
00:38:55,797 --> 00:38:58,288
Are you gonna believe Adrian Monk?
He's a freak. Ask anybody.

606
00:38:58,366 --> 00:39:00,357
Let's empty out
all your pockets. Come on.

607
00:39:02,737 --> 00:39:05,297
That's my money.

were all over that room.

612
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,986
This money's from the bake sale.

613
00:39:21,055 --> 00:39:23,751
That's my handwriting.
I wrote "good luck"...

614
00:39:23,825 --> 00:39:27,022
next to "Honest Abe" Lincoln.

615
00:39:27,095 --> 00:39:29,928
Why don't you and I
have a little talk in my office?

616
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:32,990
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

617
00:39:33,067 --> 00:39:36,002
Nobody was supposed
to get hurt.

618
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:39,506
What was Gladys doing there?
It was supposed to be her day off.

619
00:39:40,675 --> 00:39:43,576
Lieutenant Disher,
book him.

620
00:39:43,645 --> 00:39:47,376
The crazy thing is,
it worked.

621
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,884
Congratulations, darling.

622
00:39:57,725 --> 00:40:00,250
Thank you.
You're amazing.

623
00:40:12,707 --> 00:40:15,005
You're still amazing.

624
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,418
Adrian.
Bye.

625
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:33,018
