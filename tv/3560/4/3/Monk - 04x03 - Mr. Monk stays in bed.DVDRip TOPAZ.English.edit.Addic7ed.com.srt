00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:19,009
Oh, okay.
Thank you, honey.
I will be right back.

156

What are you doing?
Where are you going?

00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,788
I'm just gonna run up
to police headquarters.

158
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:27,019
I want to talk to the captain
about the man that was killed.
<i>Natalie</i>... <i>Natalie.</i>

159
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,358
- That wasn't your fault.
- I know, Mr. Monk.

160
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,796
But I was the last person
to see him alive.

161
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:38,929
I never really thought about
what that means, you know,
but it means something.

162
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,872
It's weird.
I feel kind of responsible.

163
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:45,069
Oh, no, no, no.
You can't just leave me here.

164
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:49,080
You're gonna be okay.
Julie will be here.
What if I have to blow my nose again?

165
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:53,244
I showed her how to do the bags.
I have my phone.
I will be right back.

166

Julie, there's a pad
in that second drawer.

171
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,998
Could you get that pad
and a pen?

172

Write down everything I say.

173
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:20,810
- Is it a letter?
- No, it's not exactly a letter.

Does she have a boyfriend?

No, not that we know of.
Well, find out for sure.

177
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:34,957
Check her phone records, credit card receipts.
Go back at least 12 months on everything.

He's going through
a messy divorce.

181
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:47,004
Judge Garr ruled against him
three weeks ago.

182
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:50,008
He started screaming at her in court.
They had to restrain him.

183
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,010
Well, he hit her car.
Maybe.

184
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,013
There was an incident
as she was leaving the courthouse.

185
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:58,517
Their cars collided.
Like, a little fender bender.
He rammed her car.

186
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,018
Was it an accident?
We've got three witnesses,
but nobody's sure.

187
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,555
All we know is,
she didn't report it
or press charges.

188
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,954
Well, you find this guy.
Find him.

Natalie, look,
it's kind of crazy right now.

Say, how's our patient?
He has the flu.

191
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,933
What's he doing about it?
Complaining.
Driving me nuts.

Uh, ask Disher about that.

194
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,744
Lieutenant, the captain
said you could fill me in.

195

Yeah, well,
we don't know much.

196
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:33,042
She owns a beach house.
We're sending another
forensics team down there now.

197
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,485
Not the judge.
The other case... Alvarez.
Who?

198

Julio Alvarez.
You didn't let me finish.
Who... lio Alvarez.

Jenkins,
who caught the pizza thing?

201
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,795
"The pizza thing"? He had a name, Randy.
He might not have been a judge,
but he had a name.

202

Hey, I resent that.
I really do.

have you seen the Alvarez file?

Yeah, I just saw it.

Who's this?

209
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,983
That's the victim, Julio Alvarez.

No.
No, this isn't the guy.

to downplay the whole thing.
Said it was bad for business.

the man who came to my house
last night was Julio Alvarez.

Yeah.

the kid drove away.

No.

Um...

This is a little embarrassing,
but I'm gonna have to ask for my tie back.

308
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,806
You gave it to me.

309
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:16,082
Well, look,
if you're gonna wear such a nice tie,
you gotta wear it straight.

310
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:21,525
You don't wear
a nice tie like that crooked.
Okay, now where were we?

00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,585
Yeah, we were talking
aboutJillian Garr.

She cost me
two and half million dollars.

I admit it... I lost my temper.

314
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,733
You rammed her car.
I wasn't trying
to hurt anybody.

315
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,742
I was pissed off.

316

You know, you boys are asking
the wrong question here.

317
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,543
You should be asking,
why she didn't press charges?

318
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,414
Okay.
Why she didn't press charges?

319
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:51,582
Because she wasn't alone.
There was a man with her in the car.
I saw them kissing.

320
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,558
When I hit her,
he got out and ran.

321
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:59,029
- He didn't want to be seen.
- He was married.
She was seeing a married guy.

00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,258
Good guess.

- I put it in the recycle bin.

They just collected it.

Julie is so proud of that card.
What am I supposed to tell her?

335
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:40,269
Tell her that recycling is important...

Mr. Monk, this is important to me.

All right,
so he left the pizzeria at 7:05.

346

He didn't get here until 7:40,
and the pizza was cold. Remember?

- Cold.
- Yeah, that's right.
What do you think it means?

- Cold.

No, Natalie.
Just let the police handle it.

They don't care about this kid.
They can't even remember his name.

Mr. Monk,
I need you to come with me.

- I can't.
- Yes, you can. You can rally.

Hey, Mitch was a football player.
Players got injured all the time.

We ordered three pizzas.

One Hawaiian,
one pepperoni...
And one Veggie Master.

Yeah, the police were here.
They had the same picture.
That's definitely him.

This lawyer, Dennison,

00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:30,336
was having an affair
with Judge Garr.

521

<i>and at some point</i>

00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,560
Maybe they had a fight.

<i>We'll probably never know</i>

<i>must have seen the attack</i>
<i>or heard something</i>

536
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,066
The pizzeria knew Julio's route,

537
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,933
and Dennison knew
that ifJulio just disappeared...

538
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:31,101
<i>the cops would focus on him.</i>

<i>they'd ask a lot of questions.</i>

540
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,513
So he needed somebody else...

00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:42,246
to be the last person
who saw Julio alive.

542
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:47,447
He decided to deliver
one more pizza, as Julio,

543
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,857
to divert attention from himself.

544
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:54,261
You were right, Natalie.
Julio didn't deliver that pizza.

545
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,268
The man who killed him did.

546
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:02,272
<i>He was smart,</i>
<i>but he made two mistakes.</i>

Big mistakes.

548
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:08,870
One, that blood you found
on the bathroom light switch.

549
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:14,407
If that's the judge's blood,
and I think it is, he's going to jail for life.

<i>But even without that blood,</i>
<i>we could still convict him.</i>

Mistake number two...

552
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:27,327
his fingerprints are all over
that pizza box he delivered.

553

It's at the recycling dump.

My boss recycled it.

572

He separates everything into piles
exactly 20 inches high.

573
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:13,561
Then he puts each pile into a green,
10-gallon, reinforced, double-ply
trash bag which he double-tapes shut.

574
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,572
Then he puts that bag
into another bag,

575
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,076

four times counter-clockwise

00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,770
I mean, look at this place.
There's two more warehouses
and there's more outside.

610
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,777
Shh.
What?

611
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,239
Shh, everybody.

612
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,877
Listen.

613
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,686
<i>?? ["Polly Wolly Doodle, '"Faint]</i>

614
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:04,233
"Polly Wolly Doodle."

<i>?? [Continues, Faint]</i>

616
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:12,832
Oh, my God, it's Julie's card.
It has a musical chip.

617
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,902
<i>?? [Continues, Louder]</i>

Wait, wait, wait!

621
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,833
Don't open it.
Wait for Forensics.

622
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:48,367
You got out of bed.

623
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,210
You took a taxi?

624
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,216
In your bathrobe.

625
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,650
[Laughing]

626
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:59,917
Mitch was right...
the great ones play hurt.

627
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,974
Good morning.
What are you doing
outside your building?

628
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:20,533
I'm just sittin'.

629
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,307
Outside?
It's a beautiful day.

630
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:29,218
I feel fine. Much better.
Okay.

631
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,220
So, I just talked
to the captain.

632
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:33,222
They found the judge's body.

633
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,224
Reggie Dennison
confessed to everything.

634
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:38,193
He even showed them
where the body was.

635
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:42,562
Really,
what are you doing out here?
You hate outside.

636
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,624
Maybe I've changed.

637
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,567
Seriously,
what are you doing out here?
