156

What are you doing?
Where are you going?

157
00:10:21,226 --> 00:10:23,160
I'm just gonna run up
to police headquarters.

158
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:26,391
I want to talk to the captain
about the man that was killed. <i>Natalie</i>- <i>Natalie.</i>

159
00:10:26,465 --> 00:10:29,730
- That wasn't your fault.
- I know, Mr. Monk.

160
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:33,168
But I was the last person
to see him alive.

161
00:10:33,238 --> 00:10:38,301
I never really thought about
what that means, you know, but it means something.

162
00:10:38,377 --> 00:10:41,244
It's weird.
I feel kind of responsible.

163
00:10:41,313 --> 00:10:44,441
Oh, no, no, no.
You can't just leave me here.

164
00:10:44,516 --> 00:10:48,452
You're gonna be okay.
Julie will be here. What if I have to blow my nose again?

165
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,616
I showed her how to do the bags.
I have my phone. I will be right back.

166
00:10:52,691 --> 00:10:54,682
Good luck, guys.

<i>[Door Closes]</i>

170
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:07,865
Julie, there's a pad
in that second drawer.

171
00:11:09,207 --> 00:11:12,370
Could you get that pad
and a pen?

172
00:11:14,312 --> 00:11:16,246
Write down everything I say.

173
00:11:16,314 --> 00:11:20,182
- Is it a letter?
- No, it's not exactly a letter.

174
00:11:20,252 --> 00:11:24,552
It's what we grown-ups call
a living will.

175
00:11:24,623 --> 00:11:27,421
Was she dating?
Does she have a boyfriend?

176
00:11:27,492 --> 00:11:30,427
No, not that we know of.
Well, find out for sure.

177
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:34,329
Check her phone records, credit card receipts.
Go back at least 12 months on everything.

178
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,459
I want everybody's best game here.
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

What's that?
A guy with a grudge. John DeLancy.

180
00:11:40,472 --> 00:11:42,406
He's going through
a messy divorce.

181
00:11:42,474 --> 00:11:46,376
Judge Garr ruled against him
three weeks ago.

182
00:11:46,445 --> 00:11:49,380
He started screaming at her in court.
They had to restrain him.

183
00:11:49,448 --> 00:11:51,382
Well, he hit her car.
Maybe.

184
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,385
There was an incident
as she was leaving the courthouse.

185
00:11:54,453 --> 00:11:57,889
Their cars collided.
Like, a little fender bender. He rammed her car.

186
00:11:57,956 --> 00:12:00,390
Was it an accident?
We've got three witnesses, but nobody's sure.

187
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:02,927
All we know is,
she didn't report it or press charges.

188
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:05,326
Well, you find this guy.
Find him.

189
00:12:05,397 --> 00:12:09,663
Captain?
Natalie, look, it's kind of crazy right now.

190
00:12:09,734 --> 00:12:12,294
Say, how's our patient?
He has the flu.

191
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,305
What's he doing about it?
Complaining. Driving me nuts.

192
00:12:15,373 --> 00:12:17,933
Any news
on theJulio Alvarez case?

193
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:20,705
Uh, ask Disher about that.

194
00:12:23,181 --> 00:12:26,116
Lieutenant, the captain
said you could fill me in.

195
00:12:26,184 --> 00:12:28,277
Yeah, well,
we don't know much.

196
00:12:28,353 --> 00:12:32,414
She owns a beach house.
We're sending another forensics team down there now.

197
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:34,857
Not the judge.
The other case-Alvarez. Who?

198
00:12:34,926 --> 00:12:38,487
Julio Alvarez.
You didn't let me finish. Who... lio Alvarez.

199
00:12:38,563 --> 00:12:41,361
The delivery guy.
Yeah, right.

200
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:43,333
Jenkins,
who caught the pizza thing?

201
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:47,167
"The pizza thing"? He had a name, Randy.
He might not have been a judge, but he had a name.

202
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:49,673
Hey, I resent that.
I really do.

203
00:12:49,741 --> 00:12:53,268
Every case is important here.
We don't play favorites. Okay.

204
00:12:53,345 --> 00:12:55,677
I've got the file right here.
Sorry.

206
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:01,610
Sergeant,
have you seen the Alvarez file?

207
00:13:01,686 --> 00:13:03,677
Yeah, I just saw it.

208
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:11,762
Who's this?

209
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,355
That's the victim, Julio Alvarez.

210
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:16,366
No.
No, this isn't the guy.

211
00:13:16,434 --> 00:13:18,368
Natalie, that's the guy.

212
00:13:18,436 --> 00:13:21,371
There's his employee I.D.
He's dead. He's in the morgue.

You said you only got
a glimpse of him last night. That's the guy.

215
00:13:26,945 --> 00:13:29,937
Is that from the judge's house?
Captain's office. I gotta go.

216
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:33,374

You didn't put his picture up,
or flowers?

219
00:13:56,341 --> 00:13:59,606
The boss wanted us
to downplay the whole thing. Said it was bad for business.

220
00:13:59,678 --> 00:14:03,341
Well, Mr. Gorman, I'm not sure
the man who came to my house last night was Julio Alvarez.

221
00:14:03,415 --> 00:14:05,610
Sure it was.
Who else could it be?

"Pepperoni, extra cheese."
Is that you? Yeah.

224
00:14:10,021 --> 00:14:13,047
I put it in the car,
the kid drove away. Was he alone?

225
00:14:13,124 --> 00:14:15,058
Sure, he was alone.

Why?

228
00:14:19,898 --> 00:14:23,163
I'd like to see where he went
before he got to my house. Are you a cop?

00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:25,601
No.
'Cause I got work to do.

230

Well, I'm not a cop, but I work

you don't have the Ebola virus. No, I'm pretty sure I do.

You gave it to me.

Well, look,
if you're gonna wear such a nice tie, you gotta wear it straight.

You don't wear
a nice tie like that crooked. Okay, now where were we?

You know, you boys are asking
the wrong question here.

317

You should be asking,
why she didn't press charges?

318
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:46,786
Okay.
Why she didn't press charges?

319
00:19:46,858 --> 00:19:50,954
Because she wasn't alone.
There was a man with her in the car. I saw them kissing.

00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:53,930
When I hit her,
he got out and ran.

- He was married. She was seeing a married guy.

This lawyer, Dennison,

520
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,708
was having an affair
with Judge Garr.

521

<i>and at some point</i>

00:32:40,998 --> 00:32:42,932
Maybe they had a fight.

<i>We'll probably never know</i>
<i>what it was about, but he killed her.</i>

<i>[Coughing]</i>

<i>must have seen the attack</i>
<i>or heard something</i> <i>and he tried to help her.</i>

Anyway, Dennison had a problem.

536
00:33:20,537 --> 00:33:23,438
The pizzeria knew Julio's route,

537
00:33:23,507 --> 00:33:26,305
and Dennison knew
that ifJulio just disappeared...

538
00:33:26,377 --> 00:33:30,473
<i>the cops would focus on him.</i>

<i>they'd ask a lot of questions.</i>

540
00:33:34,051 --> 00:33:37,885
So he needed somebody else...

541
00:33:37,955 --> 00:33:41,618
to be the last person
who saw Julio alive.

542
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,819
He decided to deliver
one more pizza, as Julio,

543
00:33:46,897 --> 00:33:49,229
to divert attention from himself.

544
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:53,633
You were right, Natalie.
Julio didn't deliver that pizza.

545
00:33:55,706 --> 00:33:57,640
The man who killed him did.

546

<i>but he made two mistakes.</i>

Big mistakes.

548
00:34:03,714 --> 00:34:08,242
One, that blood you found
on the bathroom light switch.

549
00:34:08,318 --> 00:34:13,779
If that's the judge's blood,
and I think it is, he's going to jail for life.

<i>But even without that blood,</i>
<i>we could still convict him.</i>

Mistake number two-

552
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:26,699
his fingerprints are all over
that pizza box he delivered.

553
00:34:30,607 --> 00:34:33,508
It's at the recycling dump.

What was it in,
a carton, a bag, or what? My boss recycled it.

572
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,331
He separates everything into piles
exactly 20 inches high.

573
00:36:07,404 --> 00:36:12,933
Then he puts each pile into a green,
10-gallon, reinforced, double-ply trash bag which he double-tapes shut.

574
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,944
Then he puts that bag
into another bag,

575
00:36:15,012 --> 00:36:18,448
which he wraps with twine
four times counter-clockwise and ties each end twice.

Don't open it.
Wait for Forensics.

00:40:44,247 --> 00:40:47,739
You got out of bed.

623
00:40:47,818 --> 00:40:50,582
You took a taxi?

624
00:40:50,654 --> 00:40:52,588

Good morning.
What are you doing outside your building?

628
00:41:17,414 --> 00:41:19,905
I'm just sittin'.

629
00:41:19,983 --> 00:41:22,679
Outside?
It's a beautiful day.

630
00:41:24,654 --> 00:41:28,590
I feel fine. Much better.
Okay.

631
00:41:28,658 --> 00:41:30,592
So, I just talked
to the captain.

632
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,594
They found the judge's body.

633
00:41:32,662 --> 00:41:34,596
Reggie Dennison
confessed to everything.

634
00:41:34,664 --> 00:41:37,565
He even showed them
where the body was.

635
00:41:37,634 --> 00:41:41,934
Really,
what are you doing out here? You hate outside.

636
00:41:42,005 --> 00:41:43,996
Maybe I've changed.

637
00:41:48,345 --> 00:41:50,939
Seriously,
what are you doing out here? [Sighs]
