00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:06,631
Mom, I'm starving.

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:08,783
The pizza's gonna be here in a minute.

4
00:00:09,113 --> 00:00:11,013
Maybe, maybe we
should call him again.

5
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:12,804
It's not straight.

6
00:00:18,193 --> 00:00:21,413
The bubble's right in the middle.

7
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:22,657
The level's broken.

8
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:24,713
The level is not broken, Mr. Monk.

9
00:00:24,713 --> 00:00:28,440
It can't be broken.
It's a bubble on a stick.

10
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:34,165
You have two levels?

11
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:37,256
I use this level
to check the other levels.

12
00:00:37,256 --> 00:00:39,598
It's my level-checking level.

13
00:00:39,598 --> 00:00:42,345
How do you know that
one's not broken?

14
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:44,227
That's a good question.

15
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:49,324
I take my level-checking level
to the hardware store twice a year
to have it recalibrated.

16
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:58,620
- Hey, we were getting worried.
- Sorry. It's a busy night.

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,781
That's $12.50.

18
00:01:05,445 --> 00:01:06,481
All right, there you go.

19
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:07,985
Thank you. / Thank you.

20
00:01:09,204 --> 00:01:10,546
All right.

21
00:01:10,983 --> 00:01:12,441
Come and get it.

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,000
Don't make a mess.
Remember where we are.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,509
It's cold.

24
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:19,052
I knew it.

25
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:20,998
I can't be sure.

26
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,643
We might need another level.

27
00:01:22,643 --> 00:01:25,621
Oh, my gosh, he gave me the wrong
change. He gave me a 50!

28
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:27,866
- Cool.
- No, honey, honey, not cool.

29
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:31,450
This is gonna come out of his pocket.
This is a lot of money.

30
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:33,817
I'll be right back.

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,310
I don't know. / No.

32
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:40,168
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

33
00:01:40,168 --> 00:01:42,327
Hello!
Excuse...

34
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:06,674
Hi.

35
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:14,166
Hello?

36
00:02:15,405 --> 00:02:16,800
Excuse me.

37
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:18,851
Here, you gave me the wrong change.

38
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:20,693
Here, you gave me the wrong...

00:03:27,984 --> 00:03:30,019
Hey, come on.

51
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:33,347
Can I, uh, can I get you anything?

52
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:34,491
No.

53
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:36,981
Okay, this'll just take a minute.

54
00:03:36,981 --> 00:03:39,634
- Uh, so, you didn't see anything?
- No.

55
00:03:39,634 --> 00:03:43,441
Did you hear anything? I mean,
anybody yelling or screaming for help?

56
00:03:43,441 --> 00:03:45,014
Yeah, me.

57
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:47,499
Does it ever get to you?

58
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:49,018
Seeing people dead?

59
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:50,351
Yeah, it did for a while.

60
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:51,683
But I got used to it.

61
00:03:51,683 --> 00:03:53,599
That must be awful.

62
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,240
Getting used to it.

63
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,409
You know, it was pretty awful.

64
00:03:57,912 --> 00:03:59,934
But I got used to it.

65
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:03,097
It's the worst part, you know.

66
00:04:03,097 --> 00:04:05,497
Getting used to it.

67
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:08,620
Something you never really get used to.

68
00:04:12,263 --> 00:04:15,704
His name was Julio Alvarez.
25 years old.

69
00:04:15,704 --> 00:04:19,921
He was bludgeoned to death
with a pipe or cylinder.

70
00:04:19,921 --> 00:04:21,026
Maybe a baseball bat.

71
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:23,619
Whatever it was, the killer
took it with him.

72
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:25,294
Where was he headed?

73
00:04:25,294 --> 00:04:27,769
He had one more delivery
on Vinton street.

74
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:29,760
How did the killer get him to stop?

75
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,304
There are no houses here.
No store fronts here.

76
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:34,380
Yeah, I was wondering the same thing.

77
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,542
Uh, maybe he waved him down?

78
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:39,842
Or maybe he hid out in the vehicle.

79
00:04:39,842 --> 00:04:41,806
Like, uh, do you remember
there was that, um,

80
00:04:41,806 --> 00:04:44,496
the carjacking in Mendo ci...

81
00:04:44,496 --> 00:04:45,762
What?

82
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,684
What?

83
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:53,135
Wipe.

84
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:55,243
Wipe, wipe!

85
00:04:55,243 --> 00:04:57,381
- Gee, I'm fresh out.
- Wipe...

86
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,622
Monk, I don't have a wipe.
I don't work for you.

87
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:04,026
Oh, god. I'm getting a cold.

88
00:05:04,414 --> 00:05:05,990
It was one sneeze.
That's nothing.

89
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,393
No, no, no, no.
It's a cold.

90
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:10,332
It's a cold.
I can feel it.

91
00:05:10,332 --> 00:05:12,330
- Well, don't panic.
- I'm, I'm not panicking.

92
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,534
Where's the ambulance?

93
00:05:14,534 --> 00:05:15,866
Oh, yeah.

94
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:18,323
Oh, yeah.
It's spreading.

95
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:20,931
It's spreading. Here it comes.

96
00:05:20,931 --> 00:05:23,546
I can feel it, I can feel...
I can feel it.

97
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:27,927
Whoa, I did not think it was
possible for you to get sick.

98
00:05:28,107 --> 00:05:30,171
Well, that's one plucky little microbe.

99
00:05:30,171 --> 00:05:32,744
Yeah, for a germ, you gotta be,
like, climbing mount Everest.

100
00:05:32,744 --> 00:05:34,334
That's not funny.

101
00:05:37,383 --> 00:05:39,353
Hey, look who's here,
deputy commissioner.

102
00:05:39,353 --> 00:05:40,676
What's the matter, captain?

103
00:05:40,676 --> 00:05:44,140
- Too busy to answer your phone?
- Well, as a matter of fact, I am.

104
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,407
This is what we call
a homicide investigation.

105
00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:48,568
Well, something important just came up.

106
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:51,059
A superior court judge is missing.

107
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,179
She was supposed to be
at a fundraiser at 6:30.

108
00:05:53,179 --> 00:05:55,002
She never showed up.

109
00:05:55,002 --> 00:05:57,291
6:30?
That's two hours, Marvin.

110
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,565
That's, that's not missing.
That's late for dinner.

111
00:05:59,565 --> 00:06:01,349
We're mobilizing the whole department.

112
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:03,734
We're pulling you
and every senior officer.

113
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:06,591
Wait, what am I supposed to do with him,
throw him under a bridge?

114
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,451
Hand him off.
I don't really care.

115
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,686
Natalie!

116
00:06:09,686 --> 00:06:13,180
The mayor wants you
at city hall in 20 minutes.

117
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,152
- Wait, the mayor asked for me?
- He's asking for everybody.

118
00:06:16,152 --> 00:06:22,023
This judge, Jillian Garr,
is a close personal friend.

119
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,993
- Will you take me in your car?
- Excuse me, doctor.

120
00:06:25,993 --> 00:06:27,475
- Can I talk to you?
- Can it wait?

121
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:29,616
I just found an eyelash.
It might belong to the killer.

122
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:32,621
- Please, it's very important.
- I'll be right with you.

123
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:35,016
Sir, it really can't wait.

124
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,876
- What is it?
- Do I feel warm to you?

125
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:51,760
How am I?

126
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,353
Huh! 99.9.

127
00:06:53,353 --> 00:06:54,582
Oh, no.

128
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,668
Oh, no.

129
00:06:57,972 --> 00:07:01,490
There you go.
An even 100. You happy?

130
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:08,885
Julie, don't look.
Turn around.

131
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:13,523
I've seen people blow
their nose before, Mr. Monk.

132
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:41,609
- Okay, I'm gonna throw it away.
- Outside.

133
00:07:41,609 --> 00:07:43,578
Outside, I know, I know.

134
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:49,808
Mr. Monk, I bought
this for you. Open it.

135
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:59,092
It has a musical chip in it.

136
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:02,145
Thanks.

137
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:06,817
But, uh, I really don't
like the Rock 'n' Roll music.

138
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:10,472
Mr. Monk, it's not Rock 'n' Roll.
It's polly wolly doodle.

139
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:13,802
It has a 10-year battery.

140
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:21,414
How about I put it over here,
so then you can see it?

141
00:08:26,562 --> 00:08:30,912
I'm gonna go see
if my mom needs me.

142
00:09:48,564 --> 00:09:49,554
What are you doing?

143
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:51,096
Oh, nothing.

144
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,253
Nothing.

145
00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:54,812
What are you hiding?

146
00:09:55,185 --> 00:09:57,151
I'm not hiding anything.

147
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,712
- Were you trying to muffle this?
- I was trying to kill it.

148
00:10:01,712 --> 00:10:03,715
Mr. Monk, Julie paid
for this with her own money.

149
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:05,769
She's so proud of it.

150
00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:11,305
There, you can hardly hear it.

151
00:10:11,305 --> 00:10:13,925
Okay, I want you
to get some rest, all right?

152
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:16,712
Rest is the best medicine.

153
00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:19,087
Oh, okay. Thank you, honey.
I will be right back.

154
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:19,796
No, no, wait, wait, wait.

155
00:10:19,796 --> 00:10:21,365
What, what are you doing?
Where are you going?

156
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:23,013
I'm just gonna run up
to police headquarters.

157
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:25,191
I want to talk to the captain
about the man that was killed.

158
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,741
Natalie, Natalie,
that wasn't your fault.

159
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:30,342
I know, Mr. Monk.

160
00:10:30,342 --> 00:10:33,479
But I was the last person
to see him alive.

161
00:10:33,785 --> 00:10:36,560
I never really thought
about what that means.

162
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,016
You know? But it means something.

163
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:42,034
It's weird, I feel kind of responsible.

164
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:45,127
No, you, you can't just leave me here.

165
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:47,013
No, you're gonna be okay.
Julie will be here.

166
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,129
But what if I have
to blow my nose again?

167
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:50,466
I showed her how to do the bags.

168
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:53,378
I have my phone.
I will be right back.

169
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:55,452
Good luck, guys.

170
00:11:00,752 --> 00:11:03,252
That's, uh...

171
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:09,645
Julie, there's a pad in that second drawer.

172
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:14,106
Can you get the pad and pen?

173
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:17,460
Write down everything I say.

174
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,985
- Is it a letter?
- No, it's not exactly a letter.

175
00:11:20,985 --> 00:11:25,272
It's what we grownups call a living will.

176
00:11:25,272 --> 00:11:26,776
Was she dating?

177
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:28,936
- Does she have a boyfriend?
- No, not that we know of.

178
00:11:28,936 --> 00:11:30,471
Well, find out for sure.

179
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:32,773
Check her phone records,
credit card receipts.

180
00:11:32,773 --> 00:11:34,968
Go back at least 12 months
on everything.

181
00:11:34,968 --> 00:11:38,048
I want everybody's best game here.

182
00:11:38,242 --> 00:11:40,249
- What's that?
- A guy with a grudge.

183
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:43,037
John Delancey.
He's going through a messy divorce.

184
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:47,319
Judge Garr ruled against him
three weeks ago.

185
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:49,834
He started screaming at her in court.
They had to restrain him.

186
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,352
Why, he hit her car.

187
00:11:51,352 --> 00:11:53,388
Maybe. There was an incident.

188
00:11:53,388 --> 00:11:54,845
Uh, as she was leaving the courthouse,

189
00:11:54,845 --> 00:11:57,066
their cars collided,
like a little fender-bender.

190
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:59,302
He rammed her car.
Was it an accident?

191
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,173
We've got three witnesses,
but nobody's sure.

192
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:03,296
All we know is she didn't
report it or press charges.

193
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:05,971
Well, you find this guy.
Find him.

194
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:07,018
Captain.

195
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:10,404
Natalie, look,
it's kind of crazy right now.

196
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:12,986
- Say, how's our patient?
- He has the flu.

197
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:15,670
- What's he doing about it?
- Complaining. Driving me nuts.

198
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,669
Any news on the Julio Alvarez case?

199
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:21,917
Um, ask Disher about that.

200
00:12:24,764 --> 00:12:26,870
Lieutenant, the captain
said you would fill me in.

201
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,948
Yeah, well, we don't know much.

202
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,509
She owns a beach house.

203
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:33,123
We're sending another
forensics team down there now.

204
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,959
Not the judge, the other case.
Alvarez.

205
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,987
- Who?
- Julio Alvarez.

206
00:12:36,987 --> 00:12:39,621
You didn't let me finish.
Who-lio Alvarez?

207
00:12:39,621 --> 00:12:41,573
- The delivery guy.
- Yeah, right.

208
00:12:41,573 --> 00:12:43,669
Jenkins, who caught the pizza thing?

209
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:46,067
The pizza thing?
He had a name, Randy.

210
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:48,188
He might not have been a judge,
but he had a name.

211
00:12:48,188 --> 00:12:50,348
Hey, I resent that.
I really do.

212
00:12:50,348 --> 00:12:53,070
Every case is important here.
We don't play favorites.

213
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:53,951
Okay.

214
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:56,509
- I've got the file right here.
- That's all right.

215
00:12:58,473 --> 00:12:59,824
Somewhere.

216
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,216
Sergeant, have you seen
the Alvarez file?

217
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:04,434
Yeah, I just saw it.

218
00:13:11,548 --> 00:13:12,769
Who's this?

219
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:15,084
That's the victim.
Julio Alvarez.

220
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:16,211
No.

221
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:17,907
No, this isn't the guy.

222
00:13:17,907 --> 00:13:19,590
Natalie, that's the guy.

223
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,132
There's his employee I.D.

224
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:22,562
He's dead. He's in the morgue.

225
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:24,234
That's not the man
that came to the door.

226
00:13:24,234 --> 00:13:26,427
Okay, look, you said you only
got a glimpse of him last night.

227
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:28,155
I mean, that's the guy.
Is that from the judge's house?

228
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:29,328
- Yeah.
- Captain's office.

229
00:13:29,328 --> 00:13:31,035
I gotta go.

230
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,685
That's not the guy.

231
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,744
Look, I already talked to the cops.
I barely knew the kid.

232
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:54,952
He started, like,
two or three weeks ago.

233
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:57,284
You didn't put his picture up or flowers?

234
00:13:57,284 --> 00:13:59,098
The boss wanted us to
downplay the whole thing.

235
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:00,942
- Said it was bad for business.
- Look, Mr. Gorman,

236
00:14:00,942 --> 00:14:04,268
I'm not sure the man who came to my
house last night was Julio alvarez.

237
00:14:04,268 --> 00:14:06,438
Sure it was.
Who else could it be?

238
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:08,073
- Natalie Teejer?
- Teeger.

239
00:14:08,073 --> 00:14:10,624
Pepperoni, extra cheese?
Is that you? / Yeah.

240
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:13,146
I put it in the car,
the kid drove away.

241
00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:14,878
- Was he alone?
- Sure he was alone.

242
00:14:14,878 --> 00:14:17,327
Hey, Tommy!
Not too much garlic on the calzone!

243
00:14:17,327 --> 00:14:18,847
Okay, okay!

244
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:20,384
- Hey, can I see those?
- Why?

245
00:14:20,384 --> 00:14:22,829
I'd like to see where he went
before he got to my house.

246
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,432
- Are you a cop?
- No.

247
00:14:24,432 --> 00:14:26,061
Because I got work to do.

248
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:28,265
Well, I'm not a cop,
but I work for a detective.

249
00:14:28,265 --> 00:14:30,541
- Adrian Monk.
- Who?

250
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,079
Adrian Monk.

251
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,734
He's a great detective.
He's, like, a genius.

252
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:36,726
You can ask anybody.

253
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:38,523
Hold on.

254
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:41,804
Ah, this is him now.
Stay here. I want him to talk to you.

255
00:14:41,804 --> 00:14:43,845
- Hello.
- Natalie...

256
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:46,697
Natalie, it is me, Adrian Monk.

257
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:49,462
Yes, Mr. Monk.
We were just talking about you.

258
00:14:50,394 --> 00:14:53,380
Natalie, you have to come back.

259
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,580
Mr. Monk, I can't right now.

260
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,318
I'm at the pizzeria,
talking to the manager.

261
00:14:56,318 --> 00:14:58,100
It's ebola.

262
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,689
Excuse me?

263
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:02,100
I have the ebola virus.

264
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,555
Mr. Monk, you don't
have the ebola virus.

265
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:06,485
Oh, I'm pretty sure I do.

266
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:08,666
I have all the symptoms.

267
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:13,815
I have the fever and the headache
and the massive internal bleeding.

268
00:15:13,815 --> 00:15:16,652
You have massive internal bleeding?

269
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:19,127
I believe I do.

270
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,617
That is my opinion.

271
00:15:20,617 --> 00:15:22,698
No, Mr. Monk, you have the flu.

272
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:23,809
But I'm glad you called.

273
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:25,966
I'm talking to Mr. Gorman.
He's the manager.

274
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:26,939
Hold on.

275
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:30,081
Hello.

276
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:32,669
I don't know.

277
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:34,996
- I think they're in Atlanta.
- What's he talking about?

278
00:15:34,996 --> 00:15:38,371
He's asking about the center
for disease control.

279
00:15:44,294 --> 00:15:47,624
Hey, Julio was a good guy.

280
00:15:49,835 --> 00:15:51,103
Good luck.

281
00:15:51,955 --> 00:15:53,242
Thank you.

282
00:15:57,935 --> 00:16:00,070
Delancey. John Delancey.

283
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,521
We know he's in there.
We just talked to his assistant.

284
00:16:02,521 --> 00:16:04,762
You understand
this is a private club.

285
00:16:04,762 --> 00:16:06,464
Unless you have a warrant...

286
00:16:06,464 --> 00:16:08,178
Well, how about this?

287
00:16:08,178 --> 00:16:11,144
We wait here, and you
go in there and get him.

288
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:12,558
I can't do that.

289
00:16:12,558 --> 00:16:14,428
Can't or won't?

290
00:16:14,428 --> 00:16:16,635
A little of each.

291
00:16:26,807 --> 00:16:28,496
Delancey, table six.

292
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:30,675
Seating chart, table six.

293
00:16:30,675 --> 00:16:32,164
Over there.

294
00:16:39,071 --> 00:16:40,290
Don't get up.

295
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,558
I'm Leland Stottlemeyer, homicide.
This is lieutenant Disher.

296
00:16:43,558 --> 00:16:47,060
We wanna talk to you
about Jillian Garr. / Who?

297
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:52,550
Judge Jillian Garr.

298
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,993
You threatened her in court,

299
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:56,077
and then you rammed her car
in a parking lot.

300
00:16:56,077 --> 00:16:57,736
And now she's missing.

301
00:16:57,736 --> 00:17:00,050
What are you talking about?

302
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:01,230
Captain.

303
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,078
Hang on, Randy.

304
00:17:03,704 --> 00:17:05,884
Hey, you like Tie food?

305
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:08,787
Huh?

306
00:17:08,787 --> 00:17:11,491
How's your memory now?

307
00:17:11,491 --> 00:17:14,232
Captain, this isn't table six.

308
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:17,172
Chart was upside down.

309
00:17:23,163 --> 00:17:24,618
Um...

310
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:32,285
I, uh...

311
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,003
I'm sorry.

312
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:36,437
I, um, I made a mistake.

313
00:17:36,437 --> 00:17:38,593
I thought you were somebody else.

314
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:39,924
Uh, hey, look.

315
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:41,888
Uh, here.

316
00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:44,146
Take my, my tie.

317
00:17:44,306 --> 00:17:45,946
This is a...

318
00:17:45,946 --> 00:17:47,353
it's a $100 tie.

319
00:17:47,353 --> 00:17:50,914
It was a Christmas gift, okay?

320
00:17:53,845 --> 00:17:55,222
There.

321
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:01,205
Get out of here.

322
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:10,211
We'll talk about this later.
Where is table six?

323
00:18:10,211 --> 00:18:11,912
Okay, uh...

324
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:16,413
Hold on.

325
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,915
Here's the window.

326
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,440
Oh.

327
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:25,998
My bad. That was table six.

328
00:18:25,998 --> 00:18:27,652
I was right.

329
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:32,528
Are you sure?

330
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,964
Yeah.

331
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,670
Look, I just gave him my tie.

332
00:18:39,502 --> 00:18:43,133
Plus I've lost a little bit
of authority with him.

333
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:45,727
- No, I don't think so.
- No, you don't think so?

334
00:18:45,727 --> 00:18:48,189
Well, I'm sure he'll understand.

335
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:51,218
Everybody makes mistakes, sir.

336
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,260
Hello again. Um...

337
00:19:06,435 --> 00:19:10,525
This is a little embarrassing,
but I'm gonna have to ask for my tie back.

338
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:11,916
You gave it to me.

339
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,337
Well, look, if you're gonna wear
such a nice tie,

340
00:19:14,337 --> 00:19:16,671
you gotta wear it straight.

341
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:20,448
You don't wear a nice tie
like that crooked.

342
00:19:20,448 --> 00:19:21,754
Okay now, where were we?

343
00:19:21,754 --> 00:19:25,672
Yeah, we were talking
about Jillian Garr.

344
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:31,993
She cost me $2.5 million.

345
00:19:31,993 --> 00:19:34,158
I admit it.
I lost my temper.

346
00:19:34,158 --> 00:19:35,565
You rammed her car.

347
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:38,943
I wasn't trying to hurt anybody.
I was pissed off.

348
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:41,541
You know, you boys are asking
the wrong question here.

349
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,566
You should be asking

350
00:19:42,566 --> 00:19:45,163
"why didn't she press charges?"

351
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:47,528
Okay, why didn't she press charges?

352
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:49,141
Because she wasn't alone.

353
00:19:49,141 --> 00:19:51,980
There was a man with her in the car.
I saw them kissing.

354
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,183
When I hit her, he got out and ran.

355
00:19:54,183 --> 00:19:55,810
He didn't want to be seen.

356
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,255
He was married.

357
00:19:57,255 --> 00:20:00,947
- She was seeing a married guy.
- Good guess.

358
00:20:02,455 --> 00:20:04,563
Now, could you find my waiter?

359
00:20:04,563 --> 00:20:06,812
I'm going to need another plate.

360
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:11,410
Eat your soup.

361
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,131
- I see letters.
- Yeah, it's alphabet soup.

362
00:20:18,606 --> 00:20:21,949
"A." / You don't have to eat it in order.

363
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:28,613
Where's Julie's card?

364
00:20:28,613 --> 00:20:32,065
I put it in the recycle bin.

365
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,440
They just collected it.

366
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,500
Julie is so proud of that card.
What am I supposed to tell her?

367
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,362
Tell her that recycling is important.

368
00:20:40,362 --> 00:20:44,440
And that together,
we're saving the planet.

369
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,005
"B." / Can I just talk about
the case for one minute please?

370
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:49,327
So I've been thinking about this.

371
00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:53,019
The man at the door was wearing
a baseball cap and sunglasses.

372
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,036
Sunglasses at night.

373
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:56,519
It was like he was trying
to hide his face from me.

374
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,042
Do you think it means something?

375
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:01,135
I don't know.

376
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:05,116
False alarm. That's a broken "Q."

377
00:21:05,116 --> 00:21:08,176
Mr. Monk, this is important to me.

378
00:21:08,176 --> 00:21:11,050
All right, so he left the pizzeria at 7:05.

379
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,916
He didn't get here until 7:40,
and the pizza was cold, remember?

380
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,491
- Cold.
- Yeah, that's right.

381
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:18,420
What do you think it means?

382
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:19,857
Cold.

383
00:21:19,857 --> 00:21:21,204
Do you think it's important?

384
00:21:21,204 --> 00:21:23,597
I'm so cold.

385
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:26,626
All right, he had two other
stops before he got here.

386
00:21:26,626 --> 00:21:28,904
I got the addresses.
I'm gonna retrace his steps.

387
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:30,459
No, no, no, no.

388
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:32,180
No, Natalie.

389
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,645
Just let the police handle it.

390
00:21:33,645 --> 00:21:34,962
They don't care about this kid.

391
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:36,649
They can't even remember his name.

392
00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:38,654
And they sure as hell don't
care about what I think.

393
00:21:38,654 --> 00:21:42,164
All they care about is this missing judge.

394
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:46,136
Mr. Monk, I need you to come with me.

395
00:21:46,136 --> 00:21:48,695
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. You can rally.

396
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:50,740
Hey, Mitch was a football player.

397
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,713
Players got injured all the time.

398
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:56,881
He always said,
"the great ones play hurt."

399
00:21:56,881 --> 00:21:58,656
Mr. Monk, I can't do this without you.

400
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:02,490
Just sit in the car.
It'll just take an hour.

401
00:22:05,397 --> 00:22:07,495
I can't.

402
00:22:07,732 --> 00:22:10,230
Well, I'm going.
A man was killed, and he was here.

403
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,567
I have to do something.

404
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:13,533
No, no. Natalie.

405
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,626
Natalie, you can't go.

406
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,817
You can't just leave.

407
00:22:17,817 --> 00:22:21,308
Vaporizer one is empty.

408
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:24,002
I'm almost out of ice.

409
00:22:24,002 --> 00:22:26,183
You have to do your job.

410
00:22:26,183 --> 00:22:27,633
I'm sorry, Mr. Monk.
I can't.

411
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:30,005
I'm too busy doing your job.

412
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:40,700
They were having a sleepover.

413
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,638
We ordered three pizzas.

414
00:22:42,638 --> 00:22:45,695
- One Hawaiian, one pepperoni.
- And one veggie master.

415
00:22:45,695 --> 00:22:47,445
Is this him?

416
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:48,854
Are you sure?

417
00:22:48,854 --> 00:22:52,452
Yeah, the police were here.
They had the same picture.

418
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:53,881
That's definitely him.

419
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:55,620
We felt terrible about it.

420
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,113
Was he wearing a hat or sunglasses?

421
00:22:58,113 --> 00:22:59,561
No.

422
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:03,051
Hello. / Hi.

423
00:23:03,754 --> 00:23:04,694
Can I help you?

424
00:23:04,694 --> 00:23:07,066
Sorry to bother you.
I hope this isn't a bad time.

425
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:10,894
Uh, as a matter of fact,
I'm sort of in the middle of something.

426
00:23:20,671 --> 00:23:23,584
Why?
What is all this about?

427
00:23:23,584 --> 00:23:27,609
Really sorry to bother you.
I live a few blocks away. / Yeah.

428
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:29,325
I've seen you around.

429
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,364
Yeah.

430
00:23:30,364 --> 00:23:33,444
it's about my cat snowflake.
She's run away.

431
00:23:33,444 --> 00:23:34,762
Your cat.

432
00:23:34,762 --> 00:23:36,087
Do you have a picture?

433
00:23:36,087 --> 00:23:39,833
No, see, that's the thing.
She's new. So...

434
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,474
Thanks anyway.
Sorry to bother you.

435
00:23:41,474 --> 00:23:42,575
Hold on.

436
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,217
You know what?
I did find a cat.

437
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:48,080
This morning.
She was scratching my front door.

438
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,788
She's down in the basement.

439
00:23:49,788 --> 00:23:51,497
- Come on in.
- No, it's probably not her.

440
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:52,716
- What color is it?
- White.

441
00:23:52,716 --> 00:23:55,154
See, it can't be her.
Snowflake's black.

442
00:23:55,154 --> 00:23:57,478
Snowflake is black?

443
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,214
Thanks anyway.

444
00:23:59,214 --> 00:24:02,157
You really should put
some ice on that thumb.

445
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,216
He had a what?

446
00:24:04,216 --> 00:24:06,666
A bruise on his thumb.

447
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:10,253
I remember the guy that delivered
Julie's pizza had the same bruise.

448
00:24:10,253 --> 00:24:11,832
He tried to get me in his house.

449
00:24:11,832 --> 00:24:13,042
Maybe he likes you.

450
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:15,309
Maybe he finds you attractive.
Stranger things have happened.

451
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:17,464
No, he wanted to kill me.
I can tell.

452
00:24:17,464 --> 00:24:19,006
Can't you get a search warrant?

453
00:24:19,006 --> 00:24:20,675
No, not based on this.

454
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:24,580
I mean, the guy's got a nice house, right?
And he's got some money?

455
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,322
Why would he kill a pizza delivery guy?

456
00:24:26,322 --> 00:24:28,551
- I don't know.
- Even if he did kill him,

457
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:31,601
why would he drive across town
and deliver Julie's pizza to her?

458
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:32,465
It doesn't make sense.

459
00:24:32,465 --> 00:24:34,569
Well, can't you at least
come down here and talk to him?

460
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:37,848
Yeah, I can be there in two hours.

461
00:24:37,848 --> 00:24:40,091
No, no! He could be gone by then.

462
00:24:40,091 --> 00:24:41,324
Where's the captain?

463
00:24:41,324 --> 00:24:42,931
He's working on the case.

464
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:45,616
Not your case, the other case.
The big case.

465
00:24:45,616 --> 00:24:48,026
She left the courthouse at 4:45.

466
00:24:48,026 --> 00:24:52,593
She was last seen driving north on the 101
by a surveillance camera right here.

467
00:24:52,593 --> 00:24:54,499
She was alone in the car.

468
00:24:54,499 --> 00:24:56,471
It's not centered.

469
00:24:56,471 --> 00:24:58,068
That one.

470
00:25:04,351 --> 00:25:06,617
Good. Good.

471
00:25:09,101 --> 00:25:12,869
Okay now, her car was found
in a parking lot here.

472
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:15,167
It was unlocked.
It had been wiped clean.

473
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:17,827
There were no prints, no fibers.

474
00:25:17,827 --> 00:25:20,656
I got some photographs here.

475
00:25:21,483 --> 00:25:22,822
Oh, no, wait.

476
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:25,451
I can't see. I can't focus.

477
00:25:25,451 --> 00:25:29,086
- I can't see.
- Okay, you'll look at the pictures later.

478
00:25:29,086 --> 00:25:31,601
Could you turn this?

479
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,731
Thank you.
Well, that's good.

480
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:35,958
What is this thing?

481
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:38,308
It's a humidifier.

482
00:25:39,212 --> 00:25:40,941
What's that one?

483
00:25:40,941 --> 00:25:43,379
It's a dehumidifier.

484
00:25:49,316 --> 00:25:51,169
Well, don't they cancel each other out?

485
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:53,408
Exactly.

486
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,831
Um, we know that she was seeing
somebody. He might be married.

487
00:25:59,831 --> 00:26:01,672
You can tell by her credit card records

488
00:26:01,672 --> 00:26:05,219
that they went on a trip
together in February.

489
00:26:05,219 --> 00:26:09,928
They went to Oakley, Idaho
February 10th, for two weeks.

490
00:26:10,097 --> 00:26:11,934
He's not married.

491
00:26:12,912 --> 00:26:14,935
- He's not married?
- No.

492
00:26:14,935 --> 00:26:16,878
How do you know that?

493
00:26:21,862 --> 00:26:26,543
Monk, how do you know
he's not married?

494
00:26:27,175 --> 00:26:29,806
Well, they were there on Valentine's day.

495
00:26:29,806 --> 00:26:32,074
If he was married,
he would've stayed home.

496
00:26:32,074 --> 00:26:33,657
Yep, you're right.

497
00:26:33,657 --> 00:26:35,403
I need a baggie.

498
00:26:35,403 --> 00:26:37,867
They're in the drawer.

499
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:43,672
Monk, can you focus here please?

500
00:26:44,321 --> 00:26:46,772
Okay, okay, okay.

501
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,091
Monk, focus here, would you?

502
00:26:48,091 --> 00:26:49,841
Zip it. / Why...

503
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:53,553
- You gotta zip it.
- Why keep it a secret?

504
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:56,660
I'm gonna need another baggie.

505
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,983
You're gonna put this baggie
into another baggie.

506
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,691
- This big baggie?
- That's...

507
00:27:06,326 --> 00:27:08,255
Okay, Monk, stay with me here, okay?

508
00:27:08,255 --> 00:27:09,995
She's a judge.

509
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:15,210
So maybe he was someone
that she was not allowed...

510
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,046
to see socially.

511
00:27:17,046 --> 00:27:20,575
Yes, like a lawyer is someone who
might be involved in one of her cases.

512
00:27:20,575 --> 00:27:22,075
A conflict of interest.

513
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:24,497
Make sure it's airtight.

514
00:27:24,497 --> 00:27:27,996
You gotta zip it.
Natalie usually folds it twice.

515
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:30,661
First you zip it.
Then you fold it.

516
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:32,947
First you gotta get the air out.

517
00:27:32,947 --> 00:27:36,833
You gotta let the air out first.
Let the air out first.

518
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:46,693
Monk, I know you probably can't tell
because I'm hiding it so well,

519
00:27:46,693 --> 00:27:52,305
but I really don't like this.

520
00:28:57,754 --> 00:28:59,176
Yeah, hello.

521
00:28:59,176 --> 00:29:02,929
Mr. Monk, I found the guy
who delivered Julie's pizza.

522
00:29:02,929 --> 00:29:06,064
It's definitely him.
His name is Reggie Dennison.

523
00:29:06,064 --> 00:29:10,848
Uh, Natalie, I've been calling you.

524
00:29:10,848 --> 00:29:12,513
I know. I didn't answer.

525
00:29:12,513 --> 00:29:14,225
I knew you'd try
to talk me out of this.

526
00:29:14,225 --> 00:29:15,696
Out of what?

527
00:29:15,696 --> 00:29:17,698
I'm in his house.

528
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,877
You're in his house?

529
00:29:21,877 --> 00:29:23,244
He put something in his car.

530
00:29:23,244 --> 00:29:25,790
I couldn't make it out.
And then he drove off.

531
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,738
You're in his house?

532
00:29:27,738 --> 00:29:30,913
I didn't know what else to do.
No one was listening to me.

533
00:29:30,913 --> 00:29:33,482
Oh, Natalie, you're in his house?

534
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:34,916
Listen.

535
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,321
Get outta there.

536
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:38,519
And...

537
00:29:38,726 --> 00:29:43,752
Can you pick up some cough drops
on your way back?

538
00:29:43,752 --> 00:29:46,138
But get outta there!

539
00:29:46,138 --> 00:29:48,020
Don't forget the cough drops.

540
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,518
- I'm not leaving here until I find it.
- Find what?

541
00:29:50,518 --> 00:29:53,035
I don't know. I don't know.
I just, I need proof.

542
00:29:53,035 --> 00:29:56,220
Mr. Monk, just please help me.
I don't know what I'm looking for.

543
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,350
The fireplace.

544
00:29:59,504 --> 00:30:02,729
He was burning something.
Hold on, hold on.

545
00:30:05,126 --> 00:30:07,231
There's one. It's him.

546
00:30:07,231 --> 00:30:09,466
He's with a woman,
but I can't make it out.

547
00:30:09,466 --> 00:30:11,921
They're at a hotel, the Oakley inn.

548
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:16,159
Whoa, uh, Oakley inn?

549
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,151
Oakley inn.

550
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,309
Natalie, is,

551
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:24,456
is this guy a lawyer?

552
00:30:26,494 --> 00:30:29,345
Okay now, how did you know that?
Whitley University School Of Law

553
00:30:30,181 --> 00:30:31,803
I smell something.

554
00:30:31,803 --> 00:30:33,942
It's bleach.

555
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:43,731
Okay, I'm in the bathroom.

556
00:30:43,731 --> 00:30:45,547
He must have just cleaned it.

557
00:30:45,547 --> 00:30:47,764
It smells like...

558
00:30:48,072 --> 00:30:49,485
it smells like your bathroom.

559
00:30:49,485 --> 00:30:51,938
Is, is, is there blood?

560
00:30:53,129 --> 00:30:54,577
Um...

561
00:30:56,624 --> 00:30:58,642
no.

562
00:30:59,364 --> 00:31:02,343
That's weird.
There's no shower curtain.

563
00:31:03,091 --> 00:31:05,481
Is there a light switch on the wall?

564
00:31:05,481 --> 00:31:06,663
Yes.

565
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:09,203
- Is it on or off?
- It's off.

566
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:11,130
Well, switch it on.

567
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,677
Be careful.
Use a wipe or something.

568
00:31:25,025 --> 00:31:26,527
It's blood.

569
00:31:26,527 --> 00:31:31,454
Oh, yeah, they always
forget the light switch.

570
00:32:16,437 --> 00:32:21,416
Natalie, Natalie,
here's what happened.

571
00:32:24,502 --> 00:32:26,856
This lawyer, Dennison,

572
00:32:26,856 --> 00:32:30,431
was having an affair with judge Garr.

573
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:33,626
She came to his house last night.

574
00:32:33,626 --> 00:32:38,006
And at some point they
decided to order a pizza.

575
00:32:39,227 --> 00:32:41,896
Somehow things turned ugly.

576
00:32:41,896 --> 00:32:46,969
Maybe they had a fight.
We'll probably never know
what it was about.

577
00:32:46,969 --> 00:32:48,897
But he killed her.

578
00:32:49,127 --> 00:32:52,307
He killed her in that bathroom.

579
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:57,999
But the delivery guy Julio...

580
00:32:58,467 --> 00:33:01,659
must have seen
the attack or heard something.

581
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:04,195
And he tried to help her.

582
00:33:04,195 --> 00:33:07,423
He died trying to save her.

583
00:33:08,129 --> 00:33:11,528
Natalie, I'm gonna need
those cough drops.

584
00:33:11,528 --> 00:33:15,725
Not the menthol.
You, you, you know the kind.

585
00:33:17,653 --> 00:33:21,024
Anyway, Dennison had a problem.

586
00:33:21,024 --> 00:33:24,110
The pizzeria knew Julio's route.

587
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:27,563
And Dennison knew that
if Julio just disappeared,

588
00:33:27,563 --> 00:33:31,075
the cops would focus on him.

589
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:34,417
They'd poke around.
They'd ask a lot of questions.

590
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:38,061
So he needed somebody else

591
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:43,306
to be the last person
who saw Julio alive.

592
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:47,233
He decided to deliver
one more pizza as Julio,

593
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,951
to divert attention from himself.

594
00:33:49,951 --> 00:33:51,824
You were right, Natalie.

595
00:33:51,824 --> 00:33:55,051
Julio didn't deliver that pizza.

596
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,383
The man who killed him did.

597
00:33:59,383 --> 00:34:02,512
He was smart,
but he made two mistakes.

598
00:34:02,512 --> 00:34:04,276
Big mistakes.

599
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:09,329
One, that blood you found
on the bathroom light switch.

600
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:12,125
If that's the judge's blood,
and I think it is,

601
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:14,433
he's going to jail for life.

602
00:34:14,433 --> 00:34:18,733
But even without that blood,
we can still convict him.

603
00:34:21,803 --> 00:34:23,257
Mistake number two,

604
00:34:23,257 --> 00:34:28,853
his fingerprints are all over
that pizza box he delivered.

605
00:34:31,871 --> 00:34:35,064
It's at the recycling dump.

606
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:38,310
I'm sure they can find it
if they have to.

607
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,353
They just collected it this morning.

608
00:34:40,353 --> 00:34:43,420
Oh, that's my other line, hold on.

609
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,729
Mr. Monk.

610
00:34:45,729 --> 00:34:49,028
Yeah, Natalie, I'll call you back.
I'm on the other line.

611
00:34:49,028 --> 00:34:50,426
Don't...

612
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,972
Where was I?

613
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,844
Natalie?

614
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,251
Natalie?

615
00:35:08,385 --> 00:35:09,820
Are you okay?

616
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,439
Say one word to anybody,

617
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:15,283
she's dead. Understand?

618
00:35:52,905 --> 00:35:54,718
Please, I have a daughter.

619
00:35:54,718 --> 00:35:56,550
Help me find it,
maybe you'll see her again.

620
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,442
Find what?

621
00:35:57,442 --> 00:35:58,649
The box! The box!

622
00:35:58,649 --> 00:36:00,618
The pizza box with my prints on it.

623
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:03,176
What was it in?
A carton, a bag, or what?

624
00:36:03,176 --> 00:36:04,565
My boss recycled it.

625
00:36:04,565 --> 00:36:07,770
He separates everything into
piles exactly 20 inches high.

626
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,834
Then he puts each pile into a green,

627
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,869
10-gallon reinforced
double-ply trash bag,

628
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,901
which he double-tapes shut.

629
00:36:13,901 --> 00:36:15,587
Then he puts that bag into another bag,

630
00:36:15,587 --> 00:36:19,497
which he wraps with twine four times
counterclockwise and ties each end twice.

631
00:36:19,497 --> 00:36:21,850
- Once he's completed that...
- Are you screwing with me?

632
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,442
No, I swear.
He's very persnickety.

633
00:36:24,442 --> 00:36:25,898
All right.

634
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,756
He said that it was
picked up this morning.

635
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:32,884
We'll start there.

636
00:36:43,398 --> 00:36:45,274
Look down here.

637
00:37:18,466 --> 00:37:19,832
I don't see it.

638
00:37:19,832 --> 00:37:21,777
- You're stalling.
- I'm not. I swear to god.

639
00:37:21,777 --> 00:37:26,908
I'm gonna give you one more chance
to help me find the damn box.

640
00:37:54,422 --> 00:37:55,809
We'll take the back.

641
00:38:26,386 --> 00:38:27,732
Where is Monk?

642
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,620
- Where is he?
- Get him up.

643
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,288
Where is he?

644
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,015
Get him outta here.

645
00:38:55,854 --> 00:38:57,642
Is it all off?

646
00:38:57,642 --> 00:38:59,397
I think so.

647
00:38:59,397 --> 00:39:01,512
Yep, good as new.

648
00:39:02,505 --> 00:39:03,711
Is he talking?

649
00:39:03,711 --> 00:39:05,945
He's a lawyer, so, yeah.

650
00:39:05,945 --> 00:39:09,986
He says that you brought him
here at knifepoint. / What?

651
00:39:09,986 --> 00:39:13,218
He says that you've been stalking him
and that you're crazy.

652
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:14,282
You were in his house.

653
00:39:14,282 --> 00:39:16,735
- You can't let him go.
- As of this moment,

654
00:39:16,735 --> 00:39:20,699
we have no physical evidence to connect
that man to either of the murders.

655
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:21,652
What about the pizza box?

656
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:23,299
Well, if we could find the pizza box,

657
00:39:23,299 --> 00:39:25,229
and it came from Monk's house,

658
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:28,422
and it has his fingerprints on it,
well then, it's a slam dunk.

659
00:39:28,422 --> 00:39:30,389
We're not gonna find it.

660
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:32,147
Forget it. I talked to the manager.

661
00:39:32,147 --> 00:39:34,150
They don't keep any records.

662
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,607
They could've dumped it anywhere.

663
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:37,002
I mean, look at this place.

664
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:41,349
There's two more warehouses,
and there's more outside. / What?

665
00:39:43,163 --> 00:39:46,079
Shhh, everybody.

666
00:40:02,386 --> 00:40:05,307
Polly wolly doodle.

667
00:40:08,975 --> 00:40:12,588
Oh, my god, it's Julie's card.
It has a musical chip.

668
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:41,926
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't open it.

669
00:40:41,926 --> 00:40:43,807
Wait for forensics.

670
00:40:46,024 --> 00:40:48,237
You got outta bed?

671
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,931
You took a taxi?

672
00:40:51,142 --> 00:40:53,298
In your bathrobe.

673
00:40:55,791 --> 00:40:58,064
Mitch was right.

674
00:40:58,064 --> 00:41:00,915
The great ones play hurt.

675
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,633
Good morning.

676
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:18,152
What are you doing outside
of your building?

677
00:41:18,152 --> 00:41:20,006
I'm just sitting here.

678
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:21,973
Outside?

679
00:41:21,973 --> 00:41:24,019
It's a beautiful day.

680
00:41:25,433 --> 00:41:28,450
I feel fine, much better.

681
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,559
Okay.

682
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:31,413
So I just talked to the captain.

683
00:41:31,413 --> 00:41:33,262
They found the judge's body.

684
00:41:33,262 --> 00:41:35,115
Reggie Dennison confessed
to everything.

685
00:41:35,115 --> 00:41:38,033
He even showed them
where the body was.

686
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:40,832
Really, what are you doing out here?

687
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,520
You hate outside.

688
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,099
Maybe I've changed.

689
00:41:49,522 --> 00:41:52,151
Seriously, what are you doing out here?

690
00:42:00,383 --> 00:42:09,298
