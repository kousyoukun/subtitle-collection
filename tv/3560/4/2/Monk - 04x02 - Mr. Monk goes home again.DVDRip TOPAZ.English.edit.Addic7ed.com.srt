Let's do this again.
So, he pays you
and then he walks out.

300
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,918
A minute later you hear shots.
You run to the window and see...

301
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,419
this guy shooting the driver.

302
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,615
Yeah.
And then he looks
in the back of the truck,

303
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,658
sees it's empty,
and he takes off.
Uh, no, sir.

304
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:50,320
- He never looked
in the back of the truck.
- Really?

No. He's thinking.

Okay.

311
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,956

you all for quite a while.

<i>Can anybody tell me</i>
<i>which way he ran off?</i>

313

He went that way.
I saw him turn left
on Hamilton Street.

Uh-huh.
You sure you weren't
hallucinating?

And why you, but not you?

325
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,570
Maybe he's afraid of karate.

<i>Or maybe he's afraid of pirates.</i>

No, that's just stupid.

328

How many of you stopped by
my brother's house, the big gray
house near the end of Oakview?

You mean where the special man

Hey, well, there's just no

He wants candy...
And not just any candy.

That's right. He's only interested
in candy from this house.

You know, I can't help
but wonder why.

The answer is here.
It is right in front of us.

348
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:20,496
And you're saying that this is somehow
connected to the armored car thing?

349
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,473
Well, l-I bought all this candy
at Beachs Market.

350
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,033
They deliver.
And that's where the driver
was killed, right?

351
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:29,512
Plus, I found this where
the kids were attacked.

It's a clove cigarette.
Yeah, actually,
I researched these.

They're common.
150 stores in this area sell them.

Okay, you're saying that
there is a connection.

You were right

You... You don't have to.

602
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:21,981
You thought I was dying.
I'll be here Friday.

603
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:27,215
Hey, look!
There's a note.

604
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,600
"Stopped by.
Nobody home.

605
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:47,132
"Can't blame you.
I wouldn't wait for me either.

606
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,811
"Dad.

607
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:56,785
<i>"P.S. Ambrose, I'm proud of you...</i>

608
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,015
for getting out of the house."

609
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:04,389
He said he was proud of me?

610
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,565
You think he'll be back?

611
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,837
I don't know.

612
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:28,047
I think he'll be back.

613
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:32,555
Maybe we should, uh,
go inside.

614
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,350
Let's go inside.

615
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:40,124
It's better... inside.

616
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,065
Excuse me.
