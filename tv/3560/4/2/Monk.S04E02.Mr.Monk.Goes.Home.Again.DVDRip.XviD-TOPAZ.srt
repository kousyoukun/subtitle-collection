1
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:07,567
<i>No, we didn't</i>
<i>forget about you.</i>

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,609
Yeah, it's all here.
I'm looking at it now.

3
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:14,044
Two cans tomato paste,
one 16-ounce box farfalle pasta,

4
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,912
one box of Glad ForceFlex
trash bags,

5
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:18,974
one, two, three, four
candy bars...

6
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,350
and a bunch of bananas.

7
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,219
Yeah, he'll be there
in 10 minutes.

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,520
You know the address, right?

9
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:29,892
You going out tonight?
Trick-or-treating?
I think I'm a little old.

10
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:32,454
Hell, I went trick-or-treating
all through high school.

11
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:36,593
Uh, that'll be 5.51.
Here you are.

12
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,468
Here you go. Thanks.
Thank you.

13
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,635
- You have a good night.
- <i>You, too.</i>

14
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,906
<i>Hi.</i>

15
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,597
Hello. Hello.
Excuse me.

16
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:07,428
Excuse me.
Um, do you have a light?

17
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,744
<i>Get back! Get back!</i>

18
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:22,578
<i>Stay there!</i>

19
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,715
<i>Get some good shots of the gun?</i>

20
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,516
Good.
Um, shoot this crowd, too.

21
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,717
You never know.
Halloween. Am I right?

22
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,818
Something nasty always
goes down on Halloween.
Really?

23
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:46,127
What went down
last Halloween?

24
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,190
Nothing.

25
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:52,261
The one before that?
It's a new tradition.

26
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,101
Halloween.

27
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:03,872
Oh! I know this store used
to be called "McCabe's."

28
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,441
I grew up four blocks away.
After school,

29
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,919
all the kids would hang out
right here in the parking lot...

30
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,252
drinking sodas
and listening to music.

31
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,452
That sounds like fun.
Oh, yeah.
It was a lot of fun.

32
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,894
I used to stand over there
across the street.

33
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,955
I-I had a perfect view.

34
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,263
Good times.
Good times.

35
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,530
<i>Hey, Monk.</i>
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

36
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,437
Uh, it's kind of ugly.

37
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:31,034
The driver stopped around
1:15 for lunch. He's on his way
back to the truck...

38
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:36,446
when the shooter came up,
grabbed his gun, shoots him four,
maybe five times, point-blank range,

39
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:40,043
<i>but he keeps shooting him even</i>
<i>after the guy went down.</i>

40
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,519
Oh, my God.
Was he married?
I don't know.

41
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:46,650
Any kids?
I don't know, Natalie.
I just got here myself.

42
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,889
With his own gun?

43
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,796
There must have been witnesses.
Yeah, a few people
from the store.

44
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:56,426
Caucasian. Dark hair.
Maybe a blue sweater or a jacket.

45
00:03:56,502 --> 00:04:00,097
We're gonna question them again.
How much did he get?

46
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:03,074
The truck is empty.
That's all I know.

47
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:15,949
Hey, get out of there. Go.
Ho, ho, ho. Get!

48
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,490
I hate pigeons-
like rats with wings.

49
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:22,619
<i>There's no defensive wounds.</i>
<i>Was there a struggle?</i>

50
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,959
How did-
How did this guy get the gun?

51
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,226
That's a good question.
The M.E.'s gonna be here
in a minute.

52
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,531
We can ask him.
What's this?

53
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,032
Uh, this hasn't been here long.

54
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,600
It's clean.

55
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,044
That's a clove cigarette.

56
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:45,210
They make 'em in Indonesia.
People use them to try to quit smoking.
They don't work.

57
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,981
Driver's?
The driver has his own.

58
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,682
I'm thinking it's the shooter's.

59
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,816
<i>Well, run that down.</i>

60
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,826
Hello?
Every store that sells those.

61
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,624
No, Sharona's not here anymore.

62
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:01,224
Uh, about a year ago.

63
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,293
Well, I-I-I don't know
what happened.
She moved to New Jersey.

64
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,507
Sir, I don't know what happened.
You'd have to ask her.

65
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,804
Who is this?

66
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,043
Mr. Monk,
it's your brother.

67
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,414
Ambrose. I can't.

68
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,181
I-I-Tell him I'll call him back.
Tell him I'm busy.

69
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:26,692
- Your father called.
- My father?

70
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,159
He's coming home.

71
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:48,202
See? You can
trick-or-treat here.
I'll go with you.

72
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,681
Oh, fun. Trick-or-treating
with your mom.

73
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:55,711
She's at that impossible age,
between 11 and 25.

74
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,627
What? You okay?

75
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:09,293
<i>What do I say to him</i>
<i>after all these years?</i>

76
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,863
You say, "Hello, Dad.
I missed you."

77
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:19,802
No. No, I can't say that.

78
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,178
Why did he leave
just like that?

79
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,778
It was my fault.

80
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:33,189
I drove him crazy.
He said that?

81
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,750
No.
Then how do you know?

82
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,626
I-I-I know.
I-I just know.

83
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,030
Mr. Monk,
you can't blame yourself.

84
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,227
You wanna bet?

85
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,600
Julie, okay?
Be nice, okay?

86
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:49,232
Remember what we talked about?
Mr. Monk's brother's ill.
He's agoraphobic.

87
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,674
I know.
He never leaves his house.

88
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:55,043
He left once-
Once in 34 years.

89
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:59,517
At least he left.
The house was on fire.
I had to drag him out.

90
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,261
Adrian?
You talked to him?

91
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,524
I told you he'd be back.

92
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,793
He's in town on a business trip.

93
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,301
He said he'd be here
at 8:00 sharp.

94
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,203
You gave up,
but I never gave up.

95
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,538
I never gave up. Nev-
Are you trick-or-treating?

96
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,136
No. No.
This is Natalie,
my new assistant.

97
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,408
You spoke on the phone.

98
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:37,379
I'm Ambrose Monk,
Adrian's brother.
Ambrose Monk.

99
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,482
Yes, I know.
Very nice to meet you, Ambrose.

100
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:44,587
Yes.
Uh, this is my daughter, Julie.

101
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:48,225
I-I like your costume.
You're a cardiologist.

102
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,531
I'm a doctor.
No.

103
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,662
You're a cardiologist.

104
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,400
You see, that stethoscope
has a built-in concave amplifier.

105
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,411
It's called a "stethron."
Cardiologists use it to listen
for heart murmurs.

106
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,581
Guess I'm a cardiologist.
It's all right.

107
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,743
I made a mistake once.

108
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,878
Uh, c-come in.

109
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,859
Wow, this is spooky.
Do you do this every year
for Halloween?

110
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:24,198
Do what?
Um, nothing.

111
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,205
All these instruction manuals.
<i>Yes.</i>

112
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,538
Ambrose wrote them.
That's what he does.

113
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,578
Wow! Ambrose, you must be pretty
handy around the house.

114
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,580
<i>You should've been there</i>
<i>when we were putting together</i>
<i>my Malibu Jenny bungalow.</i>

115
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:40,551
- It took my mom five hours.
- I'm not surprised.
Mike Gordon wrote that one.

116
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,612
He's a hack.
The man can't tell the
difference between...

117
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,522
<i>a three-quarter inch retaining screw</i>
<i>and a half-inch lag bolt.</i>

118
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:50,187
I'm not kidding.
He actually made that mistake.

119
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,823
Still can't believe he won
the "Niz-M-U" award.

120
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,890
"Niz-M-" W-What?

121
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,868
National Society of Instruction
Manual Writers.

122
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,303
Oh, right.
I've won five of them.

123
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,637
- Can we see one?
- No.

124
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:07,702
<i>They're not here.</i>
<i>They won't mail them.</i>

125
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:13,047
<i>Well, at least you won them.</i>
<i>That's the important thing.</i>

126
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,013
It's the door.
Ambrose?

127
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,227
The door.
Excuse me.

128
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,088
<i>Trick-or-treat!</i>
<i>Trick-or-treat!</i>

129
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,794
Wait! Wait!
Not yet.

130
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:35,102
Trick-or-treat- I've accepted
your terms which means we now
have an implied contract.

131
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:39,008
By accepting this treat, you are,
in effect, promising to refrain...

132
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,013
from committing any
tricks against me or this
property now or in the future.

133
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,641
Are there any questions?
Yeah.

134
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,709
Do you have any Peanut Chews?
There's only what's in the bowl.

135
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,688
Now, one per customer.
All right?

136
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,943
Better?
Oh, yeah.
It was cluttered before.

137
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,485
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Y-You can't go in there.</i>

138
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,547
<i>You cannot go in there.</i>

139
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,221
I-I'm sorry.
I-I didn't know.

140
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:35,063
What's going on?
That is-That-That's Dad's study.
We're not allowed in there.

141
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,069
Not allowed?
Yes. They caught me in there
once when I was 12.

142
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,071
Well, what happened, Ambrose?

143
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,139
He grounded me.
For 30 years?

144
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:51,346
It's all right, Julie.
Ambrose, what's the big deal?

145
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,408
We'll just take a look around.
We're adults, right?

146
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,477
You go in there,
I will tell!

147
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,545
You better not.
I will! I-I-I'm telling!

148
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:00,251
Then I'll tell him
about the shaving kit.

149
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:06,326
Don't! Adrian, don't go in there!
It has to be exactly the way he left it.

150
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,994
It's Daddy's study.
Okay.

151
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,629
Okay. I'm not going in.

152
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,474
Excuse me, Natalie, uh, Julie.

153
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,570
I- I have trick-or-treaters.

154
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:24,013
Uh, I'm sorry.

155
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,561
How old are you?

156
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:47,595
'Cause I have a rule,
no one older than 14.

157
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,642
All right.
Only one per customer.

158
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,974
What are you doing?

159
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,139
Only one per customer.
Did you hear what I said?

160
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,979
No. Only one per customer!

161
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,450
<i>Get out of here!</i>

162
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,887
- Hey!
- Get out of here!

163
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:07,050
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

164
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,118
Ambrose, are you okay?

165
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:14,895
Ambrose, can you move?
Did he get more than one piece?

166
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:25,641
Are you sure you're okay?

167
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,305
Yeah.
The man who attacked you
was five feet tall?

168
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,507
That's right.

169
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,484
And he wore a green mask
with a bolt through the neck.

170
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,543
Did he say anything?

171
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,089
He said-
No, no, no, no.

172
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,148
It was-

173
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,627
Write down "Frankenstein".
No, it wasn't Frankenstein.

174
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:47,257
It was Frankenstein's monster.
Frankenstein was the name of
the scientist who created the monster.

175
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:53,033
- Well, it doesn't really matter.
- Captain, you can't just say,
"Frankenstein"!

176
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,370
<i>It'll confuse everybody!</i>

177
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,843
Okay, write down
"Frankenstein's Monster."

178
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,904
Well, uh, I saw the guy running
south towards the park.

179
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:07,009
Maybe he's there.
Look, it's probably just some
high school kid with the munchies.

180
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:11,147
I don't think so.
He was wearing dress shoes.
They were Italian. Forzieri's.

181
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:14,056
You noticed that, right?
I'm not familiar-

182
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,560
They're imported.
They cost about $420 a pair.

183
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,565
It's not exactly something
a high school kid with munchies
would be wearing.

184
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,999
Okay. It was a rich high school kid
with the munchies.

185
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:26,663
<i>Look, I'm really sorry that your</i>
<i>candy got spilled, but this</i>
<i>isn't a priority for us right now.</i>

186
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:30,470
You might have heard that there
was an armored car driver shot
just down the street.

187
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,603
- Right. Right.
How is that going?
- Uh, nothing yet.

188
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,204
But get this.
The driver was off duty.
The truck was empty from the start.

189
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:40,719
It was empty?
<i>Yeah, I guess the shooter</i>
<i>didn't do his homework.</i>

190
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:44,415
Anyway, we're off to question
the cashier at the grocery store.
Do you wanna come?

191
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,391
<i>I could use the help.</i>
I can't. My father.

192
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,895
Oh, yeah.
I understand.

193
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:54,023
I hope that goes well for you.
I'll call you tomorrow.

194
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,431
Come on, Lieutenant.

195
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,062
What are you doing, Lieutenant?
Oh, I'm just- Sorry.

196
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,402
You can't take that.
I don't have any extra.
It's just candy.

197
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,874
<i>I know how much I need.</i>
<i>Every year I have it</i>
<i>down to a science...</i>

198
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,742
based on current weather
conditions, recent census data,

199
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,680
and the demand
from previous Halloweens.

200
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:15,584
Last year I ended up with just
one extra candy bar.

201
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,152
Well, Ambrose, that's, um-

202
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,699
That's very-

203
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,599
I don't know what
the hell that is.
Come on, Lieutenant.

204
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,001
I'll buy you a Snickers bar.

205
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,054
Adrian, could I-
Could I talk to you?

206
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,613
Yeah. One second.

207
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,550
It's important.

208
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,393
What?

209
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,593
Uh-
Not here.

210
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,935
Stop it. I mean it.
Stop.

211
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,745
Okay. What?

212
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,125
<i>This way.</i>
<i>Oh, no. Let's-</i>

213
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:31,492
So nobody can hear
what we're doing.
Oh, great.

214
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:35,192
It's a little dusty.
All right. Come on.

215
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,498
Come on.

216
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,164
Oh, God.

217
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,231
Okay.
Shh.

218
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,334
Okay. Okay.

219
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,710
Are you and Natalie-

220
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,772
What?

221
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,545
involved?

222
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,782
What? No. No.

223
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:59,323
No. No. Wh-Why would you
even ask me that?

224
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:03,327
Well, it's been eight years
since Trudy.

225
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:06,592
Exactly.
It's only been eight years.

226
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,225
You're a widower.
She's a widow.

227
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:13,067
And I know
how you are with the ladies.

228
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,402
I remember, in high school,
those girls...

229
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:20,969
calling you on the phone,
talking to you on the phone,
complimenting you, huh?

230
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:25,073
Ambrose, those were my teachers.

231
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,846
So?

232
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,981
What about Mrs. Fagan?

233
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:36,460
Yeah?
Natalie... works for me.

234
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,053
Strictly professional.

235
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,463
Okay?

236
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,967
Is she seeing anybody else?

237
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,296
Wh-W-W-Why?

238
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,638
Why?

239
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,722
No reason.

240
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,457
- Trick-or-treat!
- Oh, you guys look amazing!

241
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,589
I love it.
Here you go.

242
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,929
Yes.

243
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,936
Hey, Julie.
Hey, Frankie.
Frankie's in my homeroom.

244
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,131
- Ah.
- So, have you gone
trick-or-treating yet?

245
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,539
If not you can come with us.
Please, Mom?

246
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,601
Okay.
Be back by 8:00.

247
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:30,580
Stick together.
You guys stay on this side
of the freeway, all right?

248
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,277
Oh, wait.
Here's my cellphone.

249
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,480
And don't eat anything
until I inspect it.
Bye, Mom.

250
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,151
<i>Good job. Thank you.</i>

251
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,559
And you'd never
seen this guy before?

252
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,758
In the store? Hanging
around the parking lot?

253
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,802
I don't think so-
But I see a lot of faces.

254
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,860
Sure.
It looks like Kiefer Sutherland.

255
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,564
Yeah, I guess it does.

256
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,236
<i>Um-</i>
It wasn't
Kiefer Sutherland, was it?

257
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,802
Uh, no, sir.

258
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,249
Here's a receipt.
This is from your cash register.

259
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,378
This is him, right?
Mm-hmm.

260
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:13,186
Eight items
at 89 cents.
Yes, sir. Eight candy bars.

261
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,523
- Eight candy bars?
- It really looks like Kiefer
Sutherland.

262
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,860
You know, maybe we should-
before we distribute it,

263
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,196
write across the bottom,
"Not Kiefer Sutherland"...

264
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,293
just so that we don't disturb
Mr. Sutherland.

265
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,429
That's a really good idea.
You think so?

266
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:31,465
No.

267
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:36,412
Let's do this again.
So, he pays you
and then he walks out.

268
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,918
A minute later you hear shots.
You run to the window and see...

269
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,419
this guy shooting the driver.

270
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,615
Yeah.
And then he looks
in the back of the truck,

271
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,658
sees it's empty,
and he takes off.
Uh, no, sir.

272
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:50,320
- He never looked
in the back of the truck.
- Really?

273
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,538
What's he doing?
You'll see. Shh.

274
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,415
Is he drunk?
No. He's thinking.

275
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,477
Okay.

276
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,956
Now, he must have been following
you all for quite a while.

277
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,391
<i>Can anybody tell me</i>
<i>which way he ran off?</i>

278
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,088
He went that way.
I saw him turn left
on Hamilton Street.

279
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,358
Uh-huh.
You sure you weren't
hallucinating?

280
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:03,424
Mr. Monk,
he's 11 years old.
He's not a real hippie.

281
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,230
<i>I got mine stolen too,</i>
<i>about twenty minutes ago.</i>

282
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,468
Mine, too.

283
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:15,639
Okay, I want all of you
who had your candy
stolen by Frankenstein...

284
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,309
to stand over here,
and the others stand over here.

285
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,375
Okay. Come on.
Let's go.

286
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,648
Here. Right here.
You here.

287
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:28,159
And you others... Good.

288
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:34,064
So, why you, but not you?

289
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:40,428
And why you, but not you?

290
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,570
Maybe he's afraid of karate.

291
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,839
<i>Or maybe he's afraid of pirates.</i>

292
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,007
No, that's just stupid.

293
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:55,315
How many of you stopped by
my brother's house, the big gray
house near the end of Oakview?

294
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:58,618
You mean where the special man
lives who never comes out?

295
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,717
Yeah. That's right.
Where the special man lives.

296
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,785
How many?

297
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:12,263
He's only taking candy from kids
who went to Ambrose's house?
What's going on?

298
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,795
I don't know. I don't know.

299
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:28,179
Wait a minute.

300
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:33,948
<i>What?</i>
No.

301
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:40,189
It's a clove cigarette.

302
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:43,462
Like the one at the murder scene.

303
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,070
Who was it this time?
Dracula?

304
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,672
The werewolf?
No, no.
It was Frankenstein.

305
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:01,014
Frankenstein's monster.

306
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:05,184
Hey, well, there's just no
stopping that crazy creature.

307
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,316
He wants candy-
And not just any candy.

308
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:10,850
He wants your candy.
That's right. He's only interested
in candy from this house.

309
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:14,228
You know, I can't help
but wonder why.

310
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:17,325
The answer is here.
It is right in front of us.

311
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:20,496
And you're saying that this is somehow
connected to the armored car thing?

312
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,473
Well, I-I bought all this candy
at Beachs Market.

313
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,033
They deliver.
And that's where the driver
was killed, right?

314
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:29,512
Plus, I found this where
the kids were attacked.

315
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:32,243
It's a clove cigarette.
Yeah, actually,
I researched these.

316
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:35,548
They're common.
150 stores in this area sell them.

317
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,783
Okay, you're saying that
there is a connection.

318
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,349
I'm here.
Convince me.

319
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:46,955
<i>Why would a killer who every cop</i>
<i>in this city is looking for hang</i>
<i>around to steal candy from children?</i>

320
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,446
We don't know.

321
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,448
You don't know.

322
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,148
Can I go trick-or-treating
or not?
No, not tonight, sweetie.

323
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,782
- You promised!
I only got to go a little bit.

324
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:18,124
Honey, there is a nut out there.
The only way you can go now
is with a police escort.

325
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:21,131
- Lt. Disher!
- Hmm?

326
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:26,136
- Come trick-or-treating with me.
- Oh, I-I don't, uh- Can I?

327
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:31,403
- No.
- Adrian, why don't you
go with her?

328
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:35,606
What?
Natalie can stay here with me...

329
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,446
and help me get ready.

330
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:43,511
That is such a good idea.
Right?

331
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,114
It's not much of a costume,
is it?

332
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:50,855
Sure, it is.
I'm a safety patrol officer.

333
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:56,629
Hey! Hey! Wait.
Cross at the green,
not in between.

334
00:23:56,701 --> 00:24:00,000
It's amazing it still fits you.
When was the last time
you wore it?

335
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:03,529
Third grade?
College.

336
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:22,150
Oh, I found some pictures.
I hope you don't mind.

337
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,718
Oh. No.

338
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:29,833
Is that your father?
<i>Oh, that's him and Ambrose.</i>

339
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,768
He named the turtle after you?

340
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:35,830
He named me after the turtle.

341
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,899
Oh, Ambrose.

342
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,742
Oh, I like this one.
You look so happy.

343
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:49,583
Mom was worried about us
because we never laughed.
So she made us practice.

344
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,350
<i>That's us practicing.</i>

345
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:57,123
So, now I can laugh-
if I have to.

346
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:08,434
- What about this one?
- <i>Uh, that was taken the day</i>
<i>before he left.</i>

347
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,106
He left because of me.

348
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,674
I was driving him crazy,
clinging to him.

349
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,878
I was too needy.

350
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,944
Mr., Monk says it was
because of him.

351
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:27,355
Nah, he's just saying that
to make me feel better.

352
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:32,853
It was me.

353
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:48,007
- <i>Gilstrap. That's a funny name.</i>
- Yeah. What time is it?

354
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,377
Um, 10 to 8:00.
We gotta get home after this.

355
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,712
No. Just
a couple more houses.

356
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,291
Trick-or-treat.
Trick-or-treat.

357
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:02,622
Well, hello. We have
a doctor in the house.

358
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,993
I'm a cardiologist.
And you're a safety boy.

359
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,055
I'm a safety patrol officer.

360
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:11,660
Well, I think you both
look wonderful.

361
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,637
Uh, no, thanks.
I'm allergic.

362
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,174
To chocolate?
No, ma'am.

363
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:21,508
I'm allergic to food that's been
sitting in a bowl all night that
other people have been touching.

364
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,605
Oh, well, I love chocolate.

365
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:27,413
I have to have a Neptune bar
every night before I go to bed
or I can't sleep.

366
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:30,386
Well, I guess we all have
our little quirks, don't we?

367
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,582
I suppose we do.

368
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,716
Mmm. Well, thank you very much.

369
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:39,594
Be careful crossing the street.
I guess I don't have
to tell you that.

370
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,834
Maybe it's fast.
It's one of the most accurate
clocks in the world.

371
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:54,208
I wrote the manual for it.

372
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,646
He'll be here.

373
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,553
Natalie, uh,

374
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,117
could I ask you something?
Hmm?

375
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,099
Would you ever, uh,

376
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:20,203
consider, uh,

377
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,569
going out with
someone like me,

378
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:27,340
or to be more specific,
me?

379
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,403
Of course,
we can't actually go out.

380
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,939
I mean, we can't go outside,
but we could go anywhere else.

381
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,585
Thank you, Ambrose.

382
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,648
Thank you.

383
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:43,785
But it's-
It's complicated.

384
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,853
Okay, I understand.
Withdrawn.

385
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,331
I never said it.
It never happened.

386
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,926
I'll- I'll get the ice.

387
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,063
My father likes a lot of ice.
I remember he used
to like to clink it.

388
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,974
Ambrose, sit down.

389
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,512
Please.

390
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,556
I can't go out with you
because...

391
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,892
I work for your brother.

392
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:20,158
Mm-hmm.
You know,
it would just get messy.

393
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:22,256
Mmm.
You can understand that.

394
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,961
Well, yeah.

395
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,903
But if I ever have
another job someday,

396
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:31,135
I hope you'll ask me again.

397
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,734
Really?
Mm-hmm.

398
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,803
So you're not saying "no"?

399
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,680
That's like a... maybe.

400
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:43,187
Y-Y-You're saying "maybe."

401
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:45,688
I'm saying "maybe."

402
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:51,125
Can I tell my father?

403
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:54,529
That w-w-w-we might
have a date someday?

404
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,262
Sure.

405
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,497
I think he'd like that.

406
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:19,518
Oh, my-
What is it?

407
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,027
Did you bring your mom's
cellphone?

408
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,267
Hey, Monk.
I hope that's your costume.

409
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:34,100
I'm a safety patrol officer.

410
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:37,164
Good for you.

411
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,608
So, what's so important?

412
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:42,145
What'd they get this time-
Three Musketeers? Milky Way?

413
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:45,614
<i>It's a pigeon.</i>

414
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:52,748
Well?
Does he look familiar?

415
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:56,157
Does he look familiar?
Take a closer look.

416
00:29:56,227 --> 00:30:00,789
At the murder scene,
you kept shooing it away.
This is that same pigeon.

417
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:08,134
Monk, you've had a tough night-
Captain, this is the same pigeon.

418
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,936
I remember it had five little
brown spots on its back...

419
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:14,342
because I remember
thinking that it reminded me
of the constellation Cassiopeia.

420
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,471
Look.
You see it?

421
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,607
Look. See?
Okay. Okay.

422
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:22,084
Okay. It's the same pigeon.
So what?

423
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,781
Remember, it was eating
something from right near
the victim's hand.

424
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:28,417
And now, five hours later,

425
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,893
it's dead.

426
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:34,489
I think it's been poisoned.

427
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:39,196
You want me to do an autopsy
on the pigeon?
Yeah.

428
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,398
Why?
What would that mean?
I don't know.

429
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,441
But it would mean something.

430
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:48,206
It would be another piece
of the puzzle.

431
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,841
Okey-dokey.

432
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:56,182
Give me the pigeon.

433
00:30:56,254 --> 00:31:02,022
Lieutenant, get that to the lab.

434
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:04,459
Thanks.

435
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,588
Happy Halloween.

436
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:52,838
He's not coming.
He'll be here.

437
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,436
Why would-
Why would he call
and not show up?

438
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:58,778
Because that's what he does.
We're better off.

439
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,977
Don't say that.
Don't say that!

440
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,543
We're better off!

441
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:07,523
Don't you say that.

442
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,254
Don't you dare say that!

443
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,331
I thought you said
you didn't have any extra.

444
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,959
I don't care.
It's my candy!

445
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:25,532
You know what your problem is?
You have never learned to wait!

446
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,882
Never!

447
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,283
Mr., Monk, what is going on?

448
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,693
What are you doing?
Cleaning out his study.

449
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:48,732
Oh, God, it's so dusty.
Is it?

450
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,636
Mr. Monk-

451
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:06,710
Hello? Yes, sir.
Mr. Monk.

452
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:09,344
It's-It's the captain.

453
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,479
Hello!
You were right
about the pigeon.

454
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,581
The bird was poisoned.

455
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,752
I had them go back and do a tox
scan on the armored car driver.

456
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,388
Turns out he had been poisoned
too before he was shot.

457
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,455
The poison was called tet-
Tetrachlorodrine.

458
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,523
Tetrachlorodrine.
Very deadly.

459
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,161
Stronger than arsenic.
It's stronger than arsenic.

460
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:28,535
Uh, it came straight
from the lab.
It hadn't even been diluted yet.

461
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:31,439
And get this.
We just talked to the plant
manager here.

462
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,977
Turns out some of this stuff
had been stolen.

463
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:37,640
They didn't realize it until
today 'cause they caught the guy
trying to put it back.

464
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,706
Wait, wait.
He was putting it back?

465
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,617
Yeah. They had to let him go.
He denied everything, and they
didn't have any evidence.

466
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,746
Uh, the guy's name is-
Gilstrap.

467
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:48,656
Gilstrap. He worked here
part-time fixing computers.

468
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:52,457
Gilstrap? Paul Gilstrap?

469
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,966
<i>Ambrose!</i>

470
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,026
- Ambrose!
Don't eat the candy!
- I paid for it.

471
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:01,799
No. Spit it out! Spit it out!
It could be poisoned.
What?

472
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,966
That's what this whole thing
has been about.

473
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,135
It's been spiked with
tetrachlorodrine.

474
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,943
Is there a Neptune bar in here?
Not anymore there isn't.

475
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,249
Oh, my God!
Natalie, call 9-1 -1.
My God.

476
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,484
I thought it tasted funny.
Tetrachlorodrine?

477
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,493
The guy down the street was
trying to kill his wife.
It's too late.

478
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,529
D-Don't say that.
Don't say that. Just get up!

479
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,791
Get up, now!
Natalie, help me!
Adrian. Adrian.

480
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:31,232
Tetrachlorodrine
is a synthetic insecticide.

481
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:34,169
Natalie, help me!
There is no antidote.

482
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:40,568
I'll be dead in five minutes.

483
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:07,799
Adrian?
I'm right here.

484
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,863
I'm right here.

485
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,671
Tell me who did this.
Shh. It doesn't matter.

486
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:15,507
It matters to me.
I don't wanna die
without knowing.

487
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,571
Shh.

488
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,446
Tell me, Adrian.

489
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,713
Okay, here's what happened.

490
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:27,815
His name is Paul Gilstrap.

491
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,053
He wanted to kill his wife.

492
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:35,225
<i>He worked in a laboratory</i>
<i>where they made tetrachlorodrine.</i>
<i>Oh.</i>

493
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:40,066
<i>A few days ago he snuck in there,</i>
<i>and he stole some of it.</i>

494
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:45,041
<i>Ambrose, I met his wife when I went</i>
<i>trick-or-treating with Julie.</i>

495
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:49,068
<i>And she said</i>
<i>that she ate a Neptune bar...</i>

496
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,911
- <i>every night before bed.</i>
- <i>Oh.</i>

497
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:56,317
<i>Gilstrap... poisoned her candy.</i>

498
00:35:56,387 --> 00:36:00,016
<i>But he couldn't poison just one.</i>

499
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:03,254
<i>He wanted to make it look like</i>
<i>there was a serial killer on the loose,</i>

500
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,228
<i>so he had to poison a lot</i>
<i>of other candy bars.</i>

501
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,266
<i>He put them back</i>
<i>into circulation.</i>

502
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,664
So his wife would just be
another victim.

503
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,105
That's right.
It's a good plan.

504
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,905
<i>But he made a mistake.</i>

505
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,445
<i>He got caught...</i>

506
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,914
<i>trying to put</i>
<i>the poison back.</i>

507
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,076
<i>Ruined everything.</i>
<i>That's right.</i>

508
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:31,280
<i>It ruined everything</i>
<i>because now, if his wife</i>
<i>or anyone else died...</i>

509
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:35,621
<i>from tetrachlorodrine,</i>
<i>they'd know it was him.</i>

510
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,287
<i>So he was desperate.</i>

511
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,263
<i>He had to get all</i>
<i>of the poisoned candy bars</i>
<i>out of circulation.</i>

512
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:45,962
<i>He found them all except for two.</i>
<i>Right.</i>

513
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:50,974
<i>The armored car driver had one.</i>
<i>He had already taken a bite.</i>

514
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,878
<i>If the driver had just</i>
<i>dropped dead,</i>

515
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,540
<i>Gilstrap knew</i>
<i>there'd be an autopsy.</i>

516
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:01,483
<i>So he had to think fast.</i>
<i>He grabbed the driver's gun...</i>

517
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,043
<i>and shot him repeatedly.</i>

518
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:09,457
<i>Who would bother looking</i>
<i>for poison in a guy who</i>
<i>had been shot five times?</i>

519
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:12,792
Which left just one candy bar.

520
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:16,492
The one I ate.
That's right.

521
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:20,765
He's been-
trying to get it back all night.

522
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,614
How much further?
20 blocks.

523
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:35,379
Adrian, I'm sorry.

524
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,648
I'm sorry.

525
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,850
- What are you talking about?
- Dad.

526
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,689
- Oh, no.
- I drove him away.

527
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,457
No. No.
He couldn't stand me.

528
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,862
He couldn't stand me, Adrian.
It was my fault.

529
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,766
No, I'm sorry.
It was me.

530
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,236
You're a good brother, Adrian.

531
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:57,536
I love you.
I love you.

532
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:01,339
Don't cry, Adrian.
Be strong now.

533
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,712
Is that another Neptune bar?

534
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:20,191
Where's the wrapper
from the one he ate?

535
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,494
It's right here.

536
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:24,557
What? What?

537
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:28,127
This one expired
eleven months ago.

538
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:32,005
That must be the candy bar
left over from last year.

539
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:35,375
From last Halloween?

540
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:41,874
That's why it tasted funny.

541
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:48,191
So this-
This is the-
This is the poison.

542
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:52,491
That's why it tasted funny.

543
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:55,191
That's why it tasted funny!

544
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:04,430
This is the-
This is the-
The one with poison.

545
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,773
I have a stomachache.

546
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:16,551
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

547
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,056
Everyone got so upset.

548
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,834
Paul Gilstrap?

549
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,600
Boo.
You missed one.

550
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:13,676
Ambrose, about our date.
Is Friday okay?

551
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:17,180
No, Natalie, that's okay.
You-You don't have to.

552
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:21,981
You thought I was dying.
I'll be here Friday.

553
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:27,215
Hey, look!
There's a note.

554
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,600
"Stopped by.
Nobody home.

555
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:47,132
"Can't blame you.
I wouldn't wait for me either.

556
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,811
"Dad.

557
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:56,785
<i>"P.S. Ambrose, I'm proud of you...</i>

558
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,015
for getting out of the house."

559
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:04,389
He said he was proud of me?

560
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,565
You think he'll be back?

561
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,837
I don't know.

562
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:28,047
I think he'll be back.

563
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:32,555
Maybe we should, uh,
go inside.

564
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,350
Let's go inside.

565
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:40,124
It's better... inside.

566
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,065
Excuse me.
