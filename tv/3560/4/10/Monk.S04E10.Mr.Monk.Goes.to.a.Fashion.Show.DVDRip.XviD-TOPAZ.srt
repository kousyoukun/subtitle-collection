1
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:10,068
How are you today?
Do you see anything you like?

2
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:13,510
Uh, is Dennis here?
He usually takes care of me.

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,481
Oh, no, I'm afraid Dennis quit.
He quit?

4
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:20,610
Yeah, apparently he had one
regular customer that was
driving him crazy.

5
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,622
Now we're gonna be up all night
wondering who that was.

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,921
Can I help you?

7
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:31,760
Dennis quit.
Yes, we are looking for another
shirt just like this.

8
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,197
Y-You want the same shirt?
Identical, yeah.

9
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,828
Same color, same pattern.
16-inch neck, 33-inch sleeve.

10
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:42,068
Okay, but you already have one
of those, so, um, maybe it's
time to try a little variety-

11
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,406
because-

12
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,604
Or maybe not.

13
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,547
Okay, um, uh, yeah.
Here you go.

14
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,608
16-inch collar, 33 sleeve.

15
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,517
No, yeah, this, uh, this was
inspected by Number 6.

16
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:02,584
I'm not a big fan of Number 6.
Do you have any that are
inspected by Number 8?

17
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:05,654
You're kidding, right?

18
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,360
You're-You're not kidding.

19
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,903
Okay, um, the customer's
always right.

20
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,997
At least until today.

21
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:20,342
Um, Number 5, Number 2.
Okay, here you go.

22
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:24,645
<i>Inspected by Number 8.</i>
Ah! There it is.

23
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,810
Is- Is there really a difference?

24
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:30,049
Are you kidding?
Look at this.

25
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,523
Look, she's an artist.

26
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,186
Oh, I've been admiring
her work for years.

27
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,992
You know, every shirt, every stitch,

28
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,329
every button is perfect.

29
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,665
There's a tear.
There's a tear.
Where, where, where?

30
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:47,729
There's a tear, right there.
And look at this.

31
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:50,207
This sleeve is all wrong.
It's completely crooked.

32
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:54,007
Well, maybe she had a bad day.
No, that's not possible.

33
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,072
I know Inspector Number 8.

34
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,141
She never lets anything
get past her.

35
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:07,015
Mr. Monk, are you okay?

36
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:12,087
Natalie, something's wrong.
What?

37
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,690
Something is very wrong
with Inspector Number 8.

38
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,265
Dennis?

39
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,668
Dennis!

40
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,805
Mrs. Hammond, I need
to hear this again, please.

41
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:05,207
Now, you came home and you
found your husband on the floor
about an hour ago.

42
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,269
Yes.
And he'd been stabbed.

43
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,406
- Yes.
- It's not funny.

44
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,450
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's not funny.

45
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:15,112
Inspector Number 8 was very
important to me because no
matter how bad things got,

46
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,349
I knew I could
always count on her.

47
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,392
Mr. Monk, you understand
you're talking about someone
you have never even met...

48
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,327
who works in a factory somewhere
who inspects shirts!

49
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,331
She's my soul mate.
You don't even know
if it's a man or a woman.

50
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,527
I love her.
I think she's in trouble.

51
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,400
Okay, maybe she's retired.
Maybe there's a new Number 8.

52
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,463
No, it's not possible.

53
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,667
She would never retire.
She loves her work.

54
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,677
Look at this shirt.
Now, Inspector Number 5,

55
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,737
I can see him retiring
because he stopped caring years ago.

56
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,805
Monk.
What?

57
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,874
They're about to take the body
away. Wanna come have a look?

58
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,216
I'll be right there!
I've only got five shirts left.

59
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,223
Wh-Wh-What if I spill something?
What if one rips?

60
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,623
What's up?
It's like an
endangered species now.

61
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,684
He's obsessing over shirts.

62
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,855
Look, put two shirts
in the dryer.
Yeah?

63
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,364
Close the door.
See if they mate.

64
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,129
Hey, Monk?
What?

65
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,193
What do you think?
About what?

66
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,671
About the dead guy
in the kitchen.
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

67
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,674
I was thinking about
something else.

68
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:14,441
He's worried about the woman
who inspects his shirts.
I've been to three different stores.

69
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,608
Captain, the stitching, i-i-it's all-
It's all wrong.

70
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,517
The collars are crooked-
Okay, Captain,
just please fill us in.

71
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,577
Okay, they're both
classical musicians.

72
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,715
They got married about
six months ago.
It's just not like her.

73
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,886
The wife was down at the
rehearsal studio practicing her cello.

74
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:32,658
She comes home 3:30,
she finds her husband dead
on the kitchen floor,

75
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,667
room temperature,
stabbed three times.

76
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:39,796
Well, she's lying.
She wasn't practicing.

77
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,932
You can't play the cello wearing
a long skirt like that.
You know what I'm gonna do?

78
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,671
I'm gonna find Inspector 8.
I'm gonna track her down.

79
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:49,511
Shirt factory's in Rockaway.
That's two hours from here.

80
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,573
I think he's right.
Yeah. Take her downtown.

81
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,778
Hey, Monk.

82
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,083
Thank you.
For what?

83
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,783
- You solved the case.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

84
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,258
If she is in trouble,
maybe I can help her.

85
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:05,661
That's Number 4.
He's a hack.

86
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,394
He makes Inspector Number 10
look like Inspector Number 6.

87
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,959
<i>Maria, line one. Maria.</i>

88
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,734
Hi. 6.

89
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,503
There she is.
There she is.

90
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,705
That's her.
That's Number 8.

91
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,873
Well, are you gonna ask her out?

92
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,282
No, I'm just, um- I'm nervous.

93
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,752
Okay, go on. Go on.

94
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,657
Excuse me,
Number 8?

95
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,561
I'm Adrian Monk.

96
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:43,125
This is my friend, Natalie Teeger.
Adrian Monk?
The same?

97
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:47,298
<i>Oh, you saved it!</i>
<i>That's the only fan letter I ever wrote.</i>

98
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,638
I am Maria Ortiz.

99
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,679
Maria, it's an honor
and a pleasure.

100
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:58,445
It's so nice when you can put
a face with the-the little tag
in the pocket.

101
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:03,051
Uh-oh.
Are you approving this?

102
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,784
Th-Th-This has a little-
little stain there.

103
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,495
I knew it. I knew it.

104
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:16,501
You are upset about something.
Maria, Mr. Monk has been
really worried about you.

105
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:20,437
It's not me.
It's my son, Pablo.

106
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,974
Oh, I remember this case.

107
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:27,809
The model, Clea Vance.
<i>The papers are wrong.</i>
<i>Everyone is wrong.</i>

108
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,644
Pablo is a good boy.
He's innocent.

109
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,514
Oh! I know it's hard.

110
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:37,454
You might feel better if you
focused on your work,

111
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:41,857
you know, and started
inspecting these shirts again.

112
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:47,098
Here's the thing, Maria. Um-

113
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,225
I've, uh- I've only got
five shirts left.

114
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,361
Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk.
You can help her.

115
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,632
Yes. Uh, Maria, Mr. Monk
is a detective.

116
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,697
He's-He's a great detective.
He's famous.

117
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,335
And you came here to help my boy?

118
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:02,404
Um, well, no, actually.

119
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,940
My, uh- My first priority
really is, uh,

120
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,384
to get you to focus again,
you know, because,

121
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,752
um, the shirts, Maria-

122
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:15,226
Mr. Monk, I have been praying for
such a one as you to help me-

123
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,888
Great.
Pablo is innocent.

124
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:21,456
When you talk to him,
you will see.
Whoa, when I talk to him?

125
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,867
Uh, no.
I-I-I-I-I-I never agreed.

126
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:28,065
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

127
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,701
Oh, Maria,
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

128
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:34,143
Stop it.

129
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:42,551
How did this happen?
How do you talk me
into these things?

130
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,785
Because it's the right
thing to do.
Have you read this?

131
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,656
Look at-
There are witnesses.
There's D.N.A. evidence.

132
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,822
Natalie, he did it.
There's no doubt about it.

133
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,889
Well, it doesn't hurt
to meet him.

134
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:57,868
If I go back to Maria and tell
her that her son <i>is</i> guilty,

135
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:02,397
she'll completely fall apart,
which would be worse
because I am down to five shirts.

136
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:11,942
- Mr. Monk. Miss Teeger?
- Yes.

137
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,816
I-I talked to my mother.
She told me you were coming.

138
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:24,463
How do you know my mother?
From her work at the factory.
I'm a big fan.

139
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,557
- A fan?
- Pablo, your mother asked
that we look into your case.

140
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:32,832
- We'd like to hear your side.
- I did not kill Clea Vance.
That is my side.

141
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,102
I never met her.
I never see her.

142
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,303
There was a fashion show
at a big hotel. I was a delivery boy.

143
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:42,279
I delivered some clothes there,
then I go home.

144
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,816
The next day, I'm arrested.

145
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,586
"It is a nightmare."

146
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:53,454
Pablo, your D.N.A.
was all over the victim.

147
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,619
Your blood.
Your hair.

148
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,822
How do you explain that?

149
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,827
I don't know.

150
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:06,531
It's a mistake.

151
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,166
Uh, a misunderstanding?

152
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:19,282
Clea Vance had a roommate who
testified that Clea was afraid of you.

153
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:23,655
She says that you were
stalking her.

154
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,556
Look. It says right here,

155
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,857
"Pablo Ortiz was obsessed with her."

156
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,365
You see that, right there?

157
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:38,393
I see it.

158
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,963
You're lying, Pablo.
It doesn't say that.

159
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,710
You can't read English, can you?

160
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:52,376
No, sir. I was raised
in Mexico with my father.

161
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,817
I have been here 3 years only,

162
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:58,914
and I can speak English, but...

163
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,982
I cannot read.

164
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,865
What is it?

165
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,739
- That's an emergency exit.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

166
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,905
Well, the killer didn't use it.

167
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:25,348
According to this floor plan,

168
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,683
he would have had to go all the way
around back through the kitchen.

169
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:30,949
It was crowded.
It was risky.

170
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,789
Somebody could have seen him.
Yeah, but he wouldn't use it.
The alarm would sound.

171
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,229
Exactly. Whoever killed
this woman read that sign.

172
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,130
And Pablo can't read.

173
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,636
Do you think he's innocent?
You do, don't you?

174
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,744
The dead model, right?
I remember this case.
I did the work on this one myself.

175
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:05,154
- Is there any new evidence?
- No. Monk met the killer's mother.

176
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,421
- She's a shirt inspector.
- She swears he's innocent.

177
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:12,328
Oh, I know. That's the hardest
part of the job, the mother's crying
and pleading.

178
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,593
- That's one thing
I'm not gonna miss.
- Where are you going?

179
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,658
Didn't you hear?
I'm retiring.

180
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,727
There's a party for me on Friday
if you wanna come.

181
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:21,568
Cool. Absolutely. I'm there.
You're retiring?
How old are you?

182
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,370
46.
Did you win the lottery?

183
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,434
No, I've been investing,
real estate.

184
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:30,141
- What have you been doing
with your savings?
- Uh, eating.

185
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,480
You know, I need to talk
to my accountant.

186
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,281
Wait, you have an accountant?
Nope, gonna have
to get an accountant.

187
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,790
- Then I'm gonna talk to him.
- There's something wrong
with this picture.

188
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:42,817
- What?
- I don't know. Something.

189
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,489
<i>So these are her shoes?</i>

190
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:49,796
That's right. Yeah, you see
this blood and this hair
and these fibers?

191
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,269
They all belong to Pablo Ortiz.
It's a slam dunk.

192
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:56,297
Yeah, I don't see any wiggle
room here, do you?
No, we got the right man.

193
00:12:56,375 --> 00:13:00,641
People lie.
People lie all the time,
but D.N.A.? It never lies.

194
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,841
I'm thinking- I'm thinking
maybe he's not the guy.

195
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,477
- Yeah, see, there's this exit door-
- Look, I heard about the exit door.

196
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,113
- It's right there.
- Look, Monk, I'd follow you
anywhere...

197
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,022
but I've got 4 cases on
my plate right now.

198
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:16,027
But you have fun.
Knock yourself out.
Thanks, Gordo.

199
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:20,657
See you at the party.
Here's the statement from that
Natasia Zorelle.

200
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,224
She was the victim's roommate.
Let's start with her.

201
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:27,068
Did you just say you were, uh,
gonna go and talk with Natasia Zorelle?

202
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,631
- The supermodel?
- Is that her?

203
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,735
Yeah, actually, I've got
the rest of the day off.

204
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,943
- I should probably go with you guys.
- You know, I think I'll come
along too, in the interest of, uh-

205
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,850
Justice?
Yeah, justice.

206
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,147
Get a close up.
Come on, Michael.

207
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:04,600
They all look so unhappy.
How can you be that attractive
and be so sad?

208
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,738
Well, maybe it's because we're
never really sure if people like
us for ourselves.

209
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,345
No, what's this?
No! No, no, no!

210
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,285
That's not what I asked for!
Look!

211
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,846
Look, the collar has to
flare like this.

212
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,791
- Huh? Do you see?
- Julian, they just painted that.

213
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,557
Hmm?
She's an animal.

214
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,691
She's in heat. Huh? Good.
You, what do you think?

215
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:32,863
- Uh, I like it.
- You like it.

216
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:36,931
What's that supposed to mean?
Say you love it or say you hate it!

217
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:41,105
Anything in between is pointless.
Wet One, Wet One, Wet One.

218
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,707
<i>Come on. Thank you.</i>

219
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:48,116
<i>You, blue shirt!</i>
<i>Are you here to audition?</i>

220
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,314
Me? No.

221
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,586
Well, you may want to consider it.
I like your attitude.

222
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,590
Hello.

223
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:11,335
If you're gonna rob me,
you should bring a gun.
Pardon me?

224
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,401
The blouse.

225
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,107
It's a knockoff
of one of my designs.

226
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,240
Oh, it is?
I didn't know.
Of course.

227
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:22,777
That's not the real crime.
The real crime is how you look in it.

228
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,949
<i>Julian, you're booked in Milan</i>
<i>the day after the show.</i>

229
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,255
Okay. Okay.
The girls are here. You said
you wanted fresh faces.

230
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,591
- Good. Good. No, darling.
- He did it.

231
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,655
Natalie, he's not
even a suspect.
Damn!

232
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,530
No. Turn around.
Not this time.

233
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,538
Next time. Oh! Mmm!

234
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,473
Yes, yes. You're perfect.
What's your name?

235
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:48,070
Sarah.
Sarah. Heaven must
be missing one of its angels.

236
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,741
Excuse me.
Sorry, um-
What?

237
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:56,049
Well, it's nothing.
It's just, uh, those eyebrows
aren't gonna look so good-

238
00:15:56,121 --> 00:16:00,649
- Which one?
- Well, the left one's higher than
the right one, isn't it?

239
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:07,458
Oh. This eyebrow is a little bit
lower than that one.

240
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:11,401
Oh, maybe next time, Sarah.
Yeah.

241
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,166
Thanks for coming in.

242
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,537
Who are you?
I'm Adrian Monk.

243
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:20,044
I'm with
the San Francisco Police.

244
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:23,047
Yeah, we're, uh-we're looking
for Natasia Zorelle.

245
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,380
Well, she's working.
Oh, and do me a favor.

246
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:30,013
Don't arrest her
until after the show.
She hasn't done anything.

247
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,058
We're actually looking
into the murder of Clea Vance.

248
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:37,289
Well, why? Isn't that old news?
I thought the killer
was in jail somewhere.

249
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:40,127
I mean, don't you people read
the newspapers?

250
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,292
Did you know her?

251
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:46,099
I know every model in California
and every wannabe.

252
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,436
Clea was a...
should-not-have-been.

253
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:53,205
You know, she showed up
wasted to my last show.
Almost ruined me.

254
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,906
Now, let that be a lesson
to you girls.

255
00:16:55,981 --> 00:17:00,008
She ruined my last show
and two hours later,
the delivery boy killed her.

256
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:04,215
- And I kid you not.
- We'd still like to talk to Natasia.

257
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:07,258
She's at the beach.
We are shooting our new
catalog.

258
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:11,285
Listen, I've gotta be there very soon,
so you can follow me if you like.

259
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,593
All right, girls. Good.
All right.

260
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,964
I'll meet you there.
I gotta go pick up Julie...
and change.

261
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,130
Okay, that's it. That's what I need.
Keep it going.

262
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,573
<i>Sell it. Sell it.</i>
<i>There we go.</i>

263
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:27,271
<i>Again. Good.</i>

264
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,611
Sell it. Sell it.
Good. Sell it.

265
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,918
Sweetie, just stay right here,
okay? I'll be back.

266
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:57,433
What are you doing?
What?

267
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:02,242
I'm standing.
This is how I stand.

268
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,305
What are you wearing?
Clothes.

269
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,374
This is how I dress.
This is how I stand.

270
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,443
This is how I dress.

271
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,661
Excuse me,
would you put that out?
It's bothering me.

272
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:28,001
But you're smoking.
My smoke isn't bothering me.

273
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:31,270
Hmm? Thank you.
All right.

274
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,777
She'll talk to you,
but make it quick.

275
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:37,509
I'm not paying her a thousand
dollars an hour just to chat.
Uh, thank you.

276
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,710
Can you give us a minute?
Sure. All right, everybody.

277
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,878
<i>Take ten. Let's get her</i>
<i>in the other dress, please.</i>

278
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,889
Sweetheart, oh,
you look ravishing.

279
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,757
These gentlemen are from the
police department. They want
to talk to you about Clea Vance.

280
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,818
Why?
We're not sure.

281
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:54,297
Probably just tilting
at windmills.
Windmills?

282
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:59,770
Mm. It's a literary reference...
from a book.

283
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,371
Um, I guess I can talk while I
change.

284
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,478
Meet me over there?

285
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,211
Only one of you.

286
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:19,354
Okay. I guess the only fair way
is, uh, alphabetically.

287
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:23,053
Oh, Adrian.
Last names.

288
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,619
So "A" is no.
Uh, "B", no, "C", no.

289
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,996
"D", Disher, that's-
Monk, you go.
It's your case.

290
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,099
Disher comes before Monk.
It's the first last name.

291
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,836
What are you,
in mourning for your life?

292
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,416
Yeah, I got it.
We're comin' in.

293
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,618
You were Clea's roommate?

294
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,683
Yeah, and best friend.
I see.

295
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,752
I see.

296
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:01,230
I see. Uh! Oh!
Oh! Whoa, whoa, oh, whoa.

297
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,599
Oh, whoa.
That's okay. I'm not shy.

298
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:09,903
- You have, uh-you have something
on your shoulder.
- Oh, it's a mole. It's my trademark.

299
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:14,309
Yeah, did-did-did you know
Pablo, uh, Ortiz?

300
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,405
I didn't know him, except that
Clea was terrified of him.

301
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:21,578
He was stalking her.
Yes, there-
there's no evidence of that.

302
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:25,953
No phone calls.
No other moles-
I mean, witnesses.

303
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:29,391
No other witnesses.
Are you saying I made it all up?

304
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,827
Um-
Why would I do that?

305
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,627
I don't know.
Look, I saw what I saw.
He brought her flowers.

306
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,101
He hit on her.
I already testified about all
this a year ago.

307
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,934
I read your statement.
Then read it again.

308
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:44,407
Okay.

309
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:47,104
What are you doing?

310
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:52,173
If you put one on this side,
you know, y-you'd be perfect.

311
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,651
Y-Your career would-

312
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,915
Do you have
any more questions?

313
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,958
No.
Good.

314
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,459
'Cause I got to get back to work.

315
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,755
Hey.
Hi, there.

316
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,864
How'd it go?
She's hot.

317
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,168
Uh, she's mildly irritated.

318
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,640
<i>Give her a minute.</i>

319
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,701
She'll calm down.

320
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,978
<i>All right, great.</i>
<i>You look beautiful.</i>

321
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,041
<i>Keep going. Great.</i>

322
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,145
Hi. Mom, I got bored.
Sweetie.

323
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,316
Please, can I stay?
I won't say anything.
Shh, shh, shh. Watch.

324
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,997
Mom, that man's looking at me.

325
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,123
What's he doing?
I don't know.

326
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,497
<i>Mr. Hodge?</i>
Who is she?

327
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,968
Who are you?
This is my daughter, Julie.

328
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,905
This is Mr. Hodge.
Let me see you walk.

329
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,239
Why?
Because lighting may be striking.

330
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,610
Your life may be changing.
Now, just walk over there.

331
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,149
Come on.

332
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:01,185
That's it, good. Turn around.

333
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:04,086
- <i>Hold your head up.</i>
<i>Smile. Come back.</i>

334
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,681
Good.
I want you to model for me.

335
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:10,091
You can be in the show
on Thursday night. Hmm?

336
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,528
You know,
you could be a big star.

337
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,725
Great and wonderful things.
Oh, my God!

338
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:19,066
No, she's 13 years old.
I've had models
younger than that.

339
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:22,595
Thirteen? She's practically middle-aged.
Thank you. I don't think so.

340
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:27,509
Anyway, it's not up to you.
This is between Julie
and her biological mother.

341
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:31,606
I <i>am</i> her biological mother.
Oh.

342
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:38,014
Mom.
No.

343
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,294
Sweetie, come on.
It's gonna get cold.

344
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:58,902
Are you wearing makeup?
I told you, not until you're 18.

345
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:02,811
Mom, when I'm 18,
I'll be too late.
I really wanna do this.

346
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:07,545
You know, a lot of these girls
have serious problems, okay?
Drugs and eating disorders.

347
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:12,215
It's just one show, and if you're
right and I hate it, I'll quit.

348
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:19,225
But at least I'll have tried.
You always tell me to try to new things.

349
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,561
Forget modeling.
You should be a lawyer.

350
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:26,229
Is that a "yes"?

351
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:29,432
I'm gonna be with you
the whole time.

352
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,443
Wow! I'm modeling
for Julian Hodge.

353
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:37,574
Isn't he wonderful?
That's not exactly the word
I would have used.

354
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:43,584
Oh. Julian.

355
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:46,180
Hi.

356
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,249
Hey.

357
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:51,352
You surprised?
Not after today.

358
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,058
I figured you might
be freaking out.

359
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:57,533
Do they know anything?
I don't think so.

360
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,593
You're not smoking.
No.

361
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:04,165
No, uh, you know, cigarettes,
they tend to leave a nasty odor.

362
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,710
I wouldn't want them
to know I was here.
Who?

363
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:15,817
The police.
Oh, I didn't tell them anything.

364
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:21,416
But you will... eventually.

365
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,825
But-
Shh, shh, shh!

366
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:30,229
It's not your fault, my darling.
You're just too pretty.

367
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,169
And beauty like yours,
a face like this-

368
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,502
Shh.

369
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,503
You just wouldn't
be able to take the pressure.

370
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,912
How's it look, Gordo?
Well, it looks like suicide,

371
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,976
smells like suicide.

372
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:27,286
Smart money's on suicide.
She drained two of those bottles
and maybe 30 sleeping pills.

373
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,192
Were those prescription?
Probably not.

374
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,253
We'll check with her doctor.
Make a note.

375
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,766
I'll remember.
Where's your notebook?

376
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:39,634
I didn't bring it.
It's an Italian suit.
It was ruining the lines.

377
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,764
Don't worry.
I got it.

378
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,833
Am I in your way?

379
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,374
She probably got depressed
after you spoke to her.

380
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,882
- All those memories
about the murder bubbling up.
- I don't think so.

381
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:56,910
One set of fingerprints
on the glass.
Yeah, they're hers.

382
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,422
But, look, she's wearing lipstick.

383
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:02,983
There's no lipstick on the glass.

384
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,427
Somebody wiped down the glass...

385
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:08,295
and then put it back in her hand.

386
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:13,394
Okay, this is now a homicide
investigation!

387
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:16,497
Lock this joint down.
Nobody touches anything.

388
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:20,773
<i>Fabio, go and borrow a notebook</i>
<i>and borrow a pencil and start</i>
<i>talking to neighbors.</i>

389
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,439
Captain, what do you
think it means?

390
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,949
It means that your boss scared
somebody.

391
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:39,163
Rest in peace.

392
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,768
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, rehearsals</i>
<i>up in ten minutes.</i>

393
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:50,069
<i>Please take your places.</i>
<i>Final touches.</i>

394
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:53,338
Oh, she looks beautiful,
doesn't she?

395
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,402
Too beautiful.

396
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,210
Sometimes I wish she had a big
old fat hairy wart right here.

397
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,717
Or maybe- maybe here.

398
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,618
Everyone, um, could you just come
around here for a moment please?

399
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:06,213
Thank you. Yes, put that down.
That's okay. Do that later.

400
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:10,284
Thank you. I just want to say
a few quick words.

401
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,989
This has been a terrible day
for us today.

402
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:20,060
<i>As you know, last night</i>
<i>we lost a dear, dear friend.</i>

403
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,665
And I know all of you here,
everyone,

404
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,802
how much we loved Natasia,

405
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:31,212
<i>except, of course,</i>
<i>when she was driving us nuts.</i>

406
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,876
But I can feel her here.

407
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:37,547
<i>I-I-I can feel her spirit,</i>
<i>her soul.</i>

408
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:43,390
Can you feel that? And I know
she's going to be with us
tomorrow night at the show.

409
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:47,795
So let's not let her down.
Huh?

410
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,925
Good.

411
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:54,267
This one's for you, baby.

412
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,740
Great. Thank you.

413
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,623
You may want to change
the earrings.

414
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,250
Look, look, look, look.

415
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:48,557
<i>I knew you'd say that. Make a note.</i>
<i>Just change those earrings.</i>

416
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:52,323
Cut! Cut! Cut, cut, cut!

417
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:56,663
<i>Cut, cut, cut.</i>
<i>Julie, Julie, Julie.</i>

418
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,136
Have you forgot something? Huh?
What?

419
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,834
Have you forgot that when it
comes to my art, I'm a total monster?

420
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,570
I mean, just look at yourself.
Look. You're a mess.

421
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:09,841
I mean, look here.
Look at this. Look at the collar.

422
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:13,475
Look, it's all twisted.
And-And-And all these wrinkles
on the dress.

423
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:17,282
<i>I mean, look, sweetheart.</i>
Natalie, do you have
the case file?

424
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,823
What?
The case file. Give it to me.

425
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:24,487
<i>I'd rather put you in a burlap</i>
<i>bag than have you seen wearing</i>
<i>my clothes like this.</i>

426
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,792
I knew something was wrong.
Look at this.

427
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:29,993
Her body is all contorted.

428
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:33,765
But the collar and her buttons
are perfectly straight.

429
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:36,830
After he killed her,
he straightened them out.

430
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:39,103
He couldn't help himself.

431
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,611
He's the guy.
Who's the guy?

432
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,141
Julie, we have to go right now.
Why?

433
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,448
I can't tell you now.
Not here.

434
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,716
But, Mom.
Do not argue with me!
G-Get your stuff now.

435
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,953
Hey! What?

436
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:58,257
Look, what's going on?
She's taking Julie home.

437
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:01,765
Well, why on earth
would she do that?

438
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:06,099
Because I told her that you
killed Clea Vance a year ago.

439
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:12,368
And I'm betting that you killed
Natasia Zorelle last night.

440
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:16,812
Who else would have straightened
the clothes on Clea Vance's body?

441
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:19,475
Oh, and why would I do
something like that?

442
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,880
I would have.
Is that it?

443
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:28,187
I straightened out the clothes?
I mean, that's not evidence.

444
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,318
That-That's a hunch.

445
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:34,388
That's all it is so far.

446
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:37,059
You trust your instincts,
don't you?

447
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,069
Oh, yes.

448
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:42,334
And would it be the same
infallible instinct that you used...

449
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,467
when you picked out
that jacket?

450
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:49,411
Or when you did those buttons
right up to the top on your shirt,
eh?

451
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,314
What about
the evidence, Mr. Monk?

452
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:56,319
What about-
You've heard of D.N.A., right?

453
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,617
I mean, does that
ring a bell here? Hmm?

454
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,784
D.N.A., yes.
The fibers, the hair
and the blood.

455
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,126
They all belonged to that boy,
Pablo Ortiz, who's in jail.

456
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:10,463
It couldn't have been me.
Just not possible.

457
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,467
You're right.

458
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,531
It's not possible.

459
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,702
But you did it.

460
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,613
Gordo, thanks
for getting here so fast.

461
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,680
Sure, what's going on?
Get a load of this.

462
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:37,592
Okay, there was a fashion show
upstairs in the ballroom.
I remember, last year.

463
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,961
And one of the models,
as you know, showed up drunk.

464
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:44,832
Clea Vance.
Exactly. So drunk,
according to Julian Hodge,

465
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,894
that she almost
ruined his show.

466
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:50,031
He was furious. I think
he followed her down here.

467
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,099
They argued.
He lost control.

468
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:55,634
He killed her. He beat her
to death right here.
Julian Hodge?

469
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:59,843
What about the evidence?
He planted it. He framed Pablo Ortiz.

470
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,409
Is that possible?
How could he plant
all that evidence...

471
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,580
and clean up every
trace of himself?

472
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,715
Actually he didn't.
He missed something.
Check this out.

473
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:10,124
There was a health
inspection the day before.
They hung that flypaper in the corner.

474
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:14,756
- How'd we miss it?
- We just found it this morning
behind that radiator.

475
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:18,962
It must have fallen back there
during the fight. And, look, there's
three or four hairs stuck to it.

476
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:22,200
And they can't be from Clea Vance
because she had long hair.

477
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:26,642
They must belong to Julian Hodge,
the real killer.
This is the proof we need.

478
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,770
How soon can you do a test
on those?
I'll get right on it.

479
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:31,781
Good work.
Thanks.

480
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:39,088
Honey, I think they're done!

481
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,162
Ooh, maybe a little overdone.

482
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:50,763
Julie?

483
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:56,234
Honey?

484
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:37,011
<i>I don't have a John Carlo, okay?</i>
<i>How many times do I have to tell you?</i>

485
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:40,881
You're not on the list, all right?
Good night. Thank you.

486
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,080
Good night!

487
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,956
- Hello. I'm on the list.
- Name.

488
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,120
Puff Daddy.
Plus one.

489
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,425
This is my girlfriend.
Hi.

490
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:57,594
Puff Daddy, the rapper?
Oh, no.
Not that Puff Daddy.

491
00:33:57,668 --> 00:34:00,136
This happens to me
all the time, doesn't it?
All the time.

492
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,503
Yeah, let me explain.
Where to begin?

493
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,304
All right, there
are two Puff Daddys.
Why don't you change your name?

494
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,471
Why doesn't he change his name
is what I'm saying.

495
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,879
I'm older than him.
I had it first.

496
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,144
One time a lawyer told me
I could sue if I-

497
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,914
- Look, my daughter's
in there. I'm going in.
- We gotta go in there.

498
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,354
Hey! Hey! Hey!

499
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:20,813
Have you seen my daughter?

500
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:28,219
Have you seen my daughter, Julie?
She's 13, long blonde hair.

501
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,658
<i>Beautiful.</i>

502
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:34,289
<i>And there's little Julie.</i>
<i>Good. She looks very good.</i>

503
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:45,367
Julie!

504
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:51,543
<i>Natalie, don't eat the food.</i>
<i>I just saw four models back there</i>
<i>throwing up.</i>

505
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,414
Julie!
Miss, you can't go out there.

506
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,991
That's not my design.
Make an announcement.

507
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,330
You cannot just run away
from me like that.

508
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,342
You scared me to death.
Mom, come on. Mom!

509
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,902
If we have a problem,
we need to talk about it, all right?
I thought we were partners.

510
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,346
<i>Wait. You're embarrassing me.</i>
Get off!

511
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:29,580
You said I couldn't do this,
but you don't tell me why.
What type of partner are you?

512
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:32,623
Okay, I had my reasons,
all right? There are grown-up
things happening here.

513
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,887
<i>There are dangerous things.</i>
<i>You have to trust me, honey.</i>

514
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,022
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
Oh, God.

515
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,728
All right?
You're so grounded.

516
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:53,968
<i>Listen, let's make sure that</i>
<i>the critics get lots to drink.</i>

517
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,843
Well, look, here's to our next
show in Milan.

518
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:58,905
<i>Cincìn.</i>
All the best.

519
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:02,248
And congratulations. Well done.
You look stunning in that dress.

520
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,518
<i>Fabulous.</i>
<i>It was a great show tonight.</i>
<i>Really fabulous.</i>

521
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:10,220
<i>Except for that one little</i>
<i>incident with that midget.</i>

522
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,956
<i>That was ridiculous.</i>

523
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:21,227
<i>Mmm. That's delicious,</i>
<i>isn't it? Delicious!</i>

524
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:24,433
I want to get you new earrings.

525
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:26,499
I want them to be drops.

526
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:30,809
Oh, look what the cat dragged in.
You know, you nearly ruined my show.

527
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,974
You nearly ruined my daughter.
Hmm.

528
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,041
- Mr. Hodge, hello.
- Oh, hello.

529
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,246
<i>Great party.</i>
Thank you.

530
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,915
There's somebody here I'd really
love for you to meet.
There he is.

531
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,084
<i>Oh? Now?</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

532
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,320
Oh, yeah.
Can't it wait?

533
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,693
No, no, no.
He's very important.

534
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:52,993
Julian Hodge, I'd like you
to meet Howard Gordon.

535
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,301
Howard is one of our
forensic experts.
Oh. How do you do?

536
00:37:56,374 --> 00:38:00,174
He's been examining some
evidence that we just uncovered
in the Clea Vance case.

537
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,269
What, new evidence?

538
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:05,144
That's right.
Four strands of human hair found
at the scene of the crime.

539
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,446
For the record, Gordo,
is this your report?

540
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:10,043
For the record, yes, it is.
Uh-huh.

541
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,522
- And you examined these hair samples
that we found earlier today?
- <i>I did.</i>

542
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:18,619
- And were you able to match these
hairs to any individual?
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

543
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:22,291
- And for the record, who do
these hairs belong to?
- Pablo Ortiz.

544
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:26,860
Ortiz? Isn't that the boy who's
already in jail for the murder?

545
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:30,737
Well, I think, gentlemen,
we're finished here.

546
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,867
Don't mind if I get back
to my party?

547
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:35,707
Hang on. Hang on.

548
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,805
Gordo, I'm sorry,
but you're under arrest.

549
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:41,750
Accessory to murder
and falsifying evidence.
What?

550
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,754
Here's what I couldn't
figure out.

551
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,586
If you were guilty, how
could all the evidence
point somewhere else?

552
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,559
There could be only
one possible answer.

553
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,892
There was something wrong
with the evidence.

554
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:58,128
<i>We did some digging, Gordo.</i>
<i>You did make a lot of money this year,</i>
<i>but it wasn't in real estate.</i>

555
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,261
Here's what happened.

556
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,535
<i>When you did the forensic work</i>
<i>on the Clea Vance murder,</i>

557
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:08,237
<i>you realized all the evidence</i>
<i>pointed to Julian Hodge.</i>

558
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:11,543
<i>You decided to cash in.</i>

559
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:14,516
<i>You made Hodge an offer</i>
<i>he was in no position to refuse.</i>

560
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:17,713
<i>For a price, you'd bury</i>
<i>the evidence against him.</i>

561
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:21,280
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

562
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,817
You had to close the case.
You needed a fall guy.

563
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:27,830
Hodge remembered a young
delivery boy named Pablo Ortiz,

564
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,889
a poor kid, barely spoke
any English.

565
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,958
He was a perfect patsy.

566
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,062
Hodge got Natasia to help him.
She called the police...

567
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,869
and accused Ortiz
of stalking her roommate.

568
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,376
<i>The police arrested Pablo.</i>

569
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:43,242
<i>They took hair and blood samples</i>
<i>and sent them to you-</i>

570
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,578
<i>And the rest was easy.</i>

571
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:48,516
<i>All you had to do</i>
<i>was re-label them.</i>

572
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,321
- Pablo never had a chance.
- You can't prove any of this.

573
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,452
We don't have to.
You proved it for us
five minutes ago...

574
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:02,227
when you swore that these hair samples
belonged to Pablo Ortiz.

575
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:04,767
So you planted that hair
to test him?

576
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,633
Well, yeah.

577
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:10,936
Whose hair was it?
It was mine.

578
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,806
Natalie pulled it out
with a tweezer.
She just yanked it out.

579
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:16,506
What was I supposed to do?
You could have cut them
like I told you to.

580
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,912
We needed the follicles.
No, we didn't need the follicles...

581
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:21,577
because we knew he wasn't
going to test anything.

582
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:24,621
That was the whole point.
It's embarrassing.
Okay, don't be such a baby.

583
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,781
Hang on. Hang on!

584
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:30,315
I forgot what we were doing.
Oh, yeah, we're arresting you two.

585
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:33,830
You know the drill, Gordo.

586
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,994
So, it's true what they say, huh?

587
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,969
You can never judge a person
by how they dress.

588
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:44,496
Well, you know what?
Let me tell you what
you're gonna be wearing.

589
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,907
I hope you like orange.
It's a little jumpsuit thing.

590
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:49,537
It has a number right here.
You can wear it anywhere, really-

591
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,706
Indoors, walking around the yard-

592
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,659
Mama.

593
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:16,532
Thank you, Mr., Monk.
How can I repay you,
Mr. Monk?

594
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:21,601
I have no money.
Now that you mention it,
it is only 2:30.

595
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:26,742
If we left now, you could be
back at work at 3:15,
put in a couple of hours,

596
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,377
inspect, what, 90,
maybe a hundred shirts.

597
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:33,583
But I took the day off.
No, no, no, no.
You don't wanna do that.

598
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:37,388
No. You're Inspector Number 8.
You have a lot of people
depending on you.

599
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:40,521
Mr. Monk, I'm sure
they would like to visit.
You know? Catch up.

600
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:44,534
Yeah, there's plenty of time
for that. They got the whole
weekend for that.

601
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,536
Unless you wanna work
on Saturday.

602
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:49,300
Saturday?

603
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,364
<i>Shh.</i>

604
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:54,138
<i>Overtime?</i>
<i>You like overtime?</i>
