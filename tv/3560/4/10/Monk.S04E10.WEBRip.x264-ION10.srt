1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,243
How are you today?
Do you see anything you like?

2
00:00:09,277 --> 00:00:12,513
Uh, is Dennis here?
He usually takes care of me.

3
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:13,781
Oh, no, I'm afraid
Dennis quit.

4
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,749
He quit.

5
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:18,052
Yeah, apparently he had
one regular customer

6
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:20,088
that was driving him crazy.

7
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:22,656
Now we're gonna be up all night
wondering who that was.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,691
Can I help you?

9
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:27,595
[whispers]
Dennis quit?

10
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:31,065
Yes, we are looking for another
shirt just like this.

11
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:32,466
You want
the same shirt?

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,068
Identical.
Same color.

13
00:00:34,102 --> 00:00:37,105
Same pattern.
16 inch neck, 33 inch sleeve.

14
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:38,806
Okay, but you already
have one of those.

15
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:43,377
So maybe it's time to try
a little variety because...

16
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:45,613
Or maybe not.

17
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:49,850
Okay, um, yeah.
Here you go.

18
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,685
16 inch collar.
33 sleeve.

19
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,088
Ah.

20
00:00:54,122 --> 00:00:57,425
No, this was inspected
by number six.

21
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,127
I'm not a big fan
of number six.

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,629
Do you have any that are
inspected by number eight?

23
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:04,732
You're kidding, right?

24
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,601
You're not kidding.

25
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:09,803
Okay, the customer's
always right.

26
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:12,840
[under his breath]
At least until today.

27
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:19,480
Um, number five, number two.
Okay, here you go.

28
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:22,583
Inspected by number eight.
Ah.

29
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:26,220
Is there really
a difference?

30
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:28,122
Are you kidding?

31
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:31,725
Look at this.
Look, she's an artist.

32
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,328
I've been admiring
her work for years.

33
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:40,801
Every shirt, every stitch,
every button is perfect.

34
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,570
There's a tear.
There's a tear.

35
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,605
Where?
There's a tear
right there.

36
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:48,442
And look at this,
the sleeve is all wrong.

37
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:49,443
It's completely crooked.

38
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:50,644
Well, maybe she had
a bad day.

39
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:53,314
No, that's not possible.

40
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:56,217
I know
inspector number eight.

41
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,689
She never lets anything
get past her.

42
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:06,494
Mr. Monk, are you okay?

43
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:11,299
Natalie, something's wrong.
What?

44
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:14,802
Something is very wrong
with inspector number eight.

45
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,177
Dennis!

46
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:25,746
Dennis!

Mrs. Hammond,
I need to hear this again.

65
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:03,711
Now, you came home,

66
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,280
and you found your husband
on the floor about an hour ago.

67
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:07,281
Yes.

68
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:08,716
And he'd been stabbed.
Yes.

69
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,351
I'm sorry.
It's not funny.

70
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:13,053
Sorry.
Inspector number eight
is very important to me.

71
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,923
No matter
how bad things got,

72
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:17,558
I knew I could always
count on her.

73
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,460
Mr. Monk, you understand
you're talking about someone

74
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:20,794
you have never even met,

75
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,596
who works in a factory
somewhere,

76
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,831
who inspects shirts.

77
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:24,865
She's my soulmate.

78
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,401
You don't even know
if it's a man or a woman.

79
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:29,937
I love her.
I think she's in trouble.

80
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,439
Maybe she's retired.

81
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:32,940
Maybe there's
a new number eight.

82
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,876
No, it's not possible.
She would never retire.

83
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:36,910
She loves her work.

84
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:37,945
Look at this shirt.

85
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,314
Now, inspector number five,
I can see him retiring

86
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:41,915
because he stopped caring
years ago.

87
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,717
Monk.
What?

88
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,386
They're about
to take the body away.

89
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,455
Wanna come have a look.
I'll be right there.

90
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:48,822
I've only got
five shirts left.

91
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:51,692
What if I spill something?
What if one rips?

92
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:55,963
Right, it's like
an endangered species now.

93
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,331
Put two shirts
in the dryer.

94
00:04:57,365 --> 00:04:58,332
Yeah.
Close the door.

95
00:04:58,366 --> 00:05:00,834
See if they mate.

96
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:03,070
Hey, Monk.

97
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,438
What?
What do you think?

98
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:05,639
About what?

99
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:07,408
About the dead guy
in the kitchen.

100
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:08,509
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,910
I was thinking
about something else.

102
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,380
He's worried about the woman
who inspects his shirts.

103
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,882
I've been
to three different stores.

104
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,751
The stitching,
it's is all wrong.

105
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:18,886
The collars are crooked.

106
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,921
Okay, Captain,
just please fill us in.

107
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,823
Okay, they're both
classical musicians.

108
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,858
They got married
about six months ago.

109
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:25,759
It's just not like her.

110
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:29,129
The wife was down
at the rehearsal studio

111
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,130
practicing her cello.

112
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,665
She comes home 3:30.

113
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,567
She finds her husband
dead on the kitchen floor.

114
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:36,570
Room temperature.
Stabbed three times.

115
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:39,940
She's lying.
She wasn't practicing.

116
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,510
You can't play the cello
wearing a long skirt like that.

117
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,878
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna find inspector eight.

118
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:45,846
I'm gonna track her down.

119
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,682
Shirt factory's in Rockaway.

120
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:49,983
That's two hours.

121
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:50,984
I think he's right.

122
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,021
Take her downtown.

123
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,523
Hey, Monk.
Thank you.

124
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:56,524
For what?

125
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:57,891
You solved the case.

126
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,092
Oh yeah.
Sure.

127
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:01,695
If she is in trouble,
maybe I can help her.

128
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:06,033
That's number four.
He's a hack.

129
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,869
He makes inspector number ten
look like inspector number six.

130
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:14,742
Hi.
Six.

131
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:18,746
There she is.
There she is.

132
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,914
That's her.
That's number eight.

133
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:23,083
Well, are you
gonna ask her out?

134
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:26,720
No, I'm just, um,
I'm nervous.

135
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,989
Okay, go on.
Go on.

136
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,027
Excuse me.

137
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,863
Number eight?

138
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,066
I'm Adrian Monk.

139
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,834
This is my friend
Natalie Teeger.

140
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:43,537
Adrian Monk?
The same?

141
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:45,639
(Monk)
Oh, you saved it.

142
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:47,775
It's the only fan letter
I ever wrote.

143
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:50,911
I am Maria Ortiz.

144
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:54,482
Maria, it's an honor
and a pleasure.

145
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:56,083
It's so nice
when you can put a face

146
00:06:56,116 --> 00:07:00,220
with the little tag
on the pocket.

147
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,123
Uh-oh.
Are you approving this?

148
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:11,198
It has a little stain there.

149
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,933
I knew it.

150
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,102
I knew it. You are
upset about something.

151
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,937
Maria, Mr. Monk has been
really worried about you.

152
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,841
It's not me.
It's my son, Pablo.

153
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,210
I remember this case.

154
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,813
The model, Clea Vance.

155
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,048
(Maria)
The papers are wrong.
Everyone is wrong.

156
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,884
Pablo is a good boy.
He's innocent.

157
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:34,021
I know it's hard.

158
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:38,125
You might feel better
if you focused on your work.

159
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:44,532
You know, and started
inspecting these shirts again.

160
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:47,935
Here's the thing, Maria.

161
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,670
I've only got
five shirts left.

162
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:52,806
Mr. Monk,
you can help her.

163
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,908
Yes, Maria,
Mr. Monk is a detective.

164
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,844
He's a great detective.
He's famous.

165
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:58,846
And you came here
to help my boy?

166
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,850
Um, well, uh, no.

167
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:06,854
Actually, my first priority
really is to get you

168
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:12,059
to focus again, you know,
because the shirts, Maria.

169
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,994
Mr. Monk,
I have been praying

170
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,729
for such a one
as you to help me.

171
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:18,198
Pablo is innocent.

172
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,933
When you talk to him,
you will see.

173
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,803
Whoa, when I talk to him?
Uh, no.

174
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:28,576
I-I-I never agreed.

175
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:32,245
Oh my gosh.
Maria, I'm so sorry, sweetie.

176
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,249
Stop it.

177
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,121
How did this happen?

178
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,990
How do you talk me
into these things?

179
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,825
Because it's
the right thing to do.

180
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,159
Have you read this?

181
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,229
There are witnesses.
There's DNA evidence.

182
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,633
Natalie, he did it.
There's no doubt about it.

183
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,802
Well, it doesn't hurt
to meet him.

184
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,169
If I go back to Maria

185
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,672
and tell her
that her son is guilty,

186
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:00,273
she'll completely fall apart,
which would be worse

187
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,976
because I am down
to five shirts.

188
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:08,882
Mr. Monk.

189
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,984
Miss Teeger?

190
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:12,085
Yes.

191
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:15,188
I talked to my mother.
She told me you were coming.

192
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,095
How do you know my mother?

193
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,965
From her work at the factory.
I'm a big fan.

194
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,333
A fan?

195
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,902
Pablo, your mother asked
that we look into your case.

196
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:30,103
We'd like to hear your side.

197
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:33,140
I did not kill Clea Vance.
That is my side.

198
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:36,610
I never met her.
I never see her.

199
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:38,311
There was a fashion show
at a big hotel.

200
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:39,813
I was a delivery boy.

201
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:42,783
I deliver some clothes there,
then I go home.

202
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,118
The next day I'm arrested.

203
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:48,656
[speaking Spanish]

204
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,858
It is a nightmare.

205
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,961
Pablo, your DNA
was all over the victim.

206
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,929
Your blood.
Your hair.

207
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:58,165
How do you explain that?

208
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:03,103
I don't know.

209
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,807
It's a mistake.

210
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,677
A misunderstanding?

211
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,049
Clea Vance had a roommate
who testified

212
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:19,753
that Clea
was afraid of you.

213
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:23,957
She said that you
were stalking her.

214
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:27,928
Look.
It says right here.

215
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,865
"Pablo Ortiz
was obsessed with her."

216
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:36,303
You see that?
Right there.

217
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,871
I see it.

218
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:44,444
You're lying, Pablo.
It doesn't say that.

219
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,014
You can't read English,
can you?

220
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,016
No, sir.

221
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:52,886
I was raised in Mexico
with my father.

222
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,088
I have been here
three years only.

223
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:59,927
And I can speak English,
but...

224
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,261
I cannot read.

225
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,241
What is it?

226
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,879
That's an emergency exit.

227
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,981
(Natalie)
Yeah?

228
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,149
The killer didn't use it.

229
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,986
According to this floor plan,

230
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,821
he would have had to go
all the way around,

231
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:29,389
back through the kitchen.

232
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,391
It was crowded,
it was risky.

233
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,826
Somebody could have
seen him.

234
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,228
But he wouldn't use it,
the alarm would sound.

235
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:36,429
Exactly.

236
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:40,901
Whoever killed this woman
read that sign.

237
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,103
And Pablo can't read.

238
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,176
Do you think he's innocent?

239
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,978
You do, don't you?

240
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,186
The dead model, right?

241
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,020
I remember this case.

242
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,454
I did the work
on this one myself.

243
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,323
Is there any new evidence?

244
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,425
No.
Monk met the killer's mother.

245
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,459
She's a shirt inspector.

246
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,328
She swears he's innocent.

247
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:09,362
Oh, I know.

248
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,363
That's the hardest
part of the job,

249
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,232
the mothers crying
and pleading.

250
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,266
That's one thing
I'm not gonna miss.

251
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,301
Where are you going?

252
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,269
Didn't you hear?
I'm retiring.

253
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,438
There's a party for me
on Friday if you wanna come.

254
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,240
Cool, absolutely.
I'm there.

255
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,274
You're retiring?
How old are you?

256
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:23,343
46.

257
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:24,812
Did you win the lottery?

258
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,346
No, I've been investing.
In real estate.

259
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,048
What have you been doing
with your savings?

260
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,918
Uh, eating.

261
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,352
You know, I need
to talk to my accountant.

262
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,787
Wait, you have
an accountant?

263
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:34,988
Nope, gonna have to get
an accountant.

264
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,223
Then I'm gonna
talk to him.

265
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,525
There's something wrong
with this picture.

266
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,360
(Stottlemeyer)
What?

267
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:44,264
I don't know.
Something.

268
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,232
So these are her shoes?

269
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,200
That's right.

270
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,535
See this blood?

271
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:49,837
And this hair
and these fibers?

272
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,871
They all belong
to Pablo Ortiz.

273
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,205
It's a slam dunk.

274
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:55,208
Yeah, I don't see
any wiggle room here, do you?

275
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,043
No, we got the right man.

276
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,311
People lie.
People lie all the time.

277
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,380
But DNA never lies.

278
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,282
I'm thinking...

279
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,583
I'm thinking maybe
he's not the guy.

280
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,285
See, there's this exit door...

281
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,220
Look, I heard about
the exit door.

282
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,989
It's right there.

283
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,357
Look, Monk,
I'd follow you anywhere.

284
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,925
But I've got four cases

285
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,526
on my plate right now.
But you have fun.

286
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,527
Knock yourself out.

287
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:15,929
Thanks, Gordo.

288
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,530
See you at the party.

289
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:21,201
Here's the statement
from that Natasia Zorell.

290
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,136
She was the victim's roommate.
Let's start with her.

291
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:25,906
Did you just say you were

292
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,007
gonna go and talk
with Natasia Zorell?

293
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,009
The supermodel.

294
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,377
Is that her?

295
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,947
Yeah, actually I've got
the rest of the day off.

296
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,849
I should probably
go with you guys.

297
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:37,084
Yeah, I think
I'll come along too.

298
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,451
In the interest of...

299
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:39,486
Justice?

300
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,587
Yeah, justice.

301
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,225
Get a close up.

302
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,875
They all look so unhappy.

303
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,945
How can you be that attractive
and be so sad?

304
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:06,379
Well, maybe it's because
we're never really sure

305
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,882
if people like us
for ourselves.

306
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,385
Now, what's this?
No! No no no.

307
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,221
That's not
what I asked for!

308
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:19,159
Look, the collar has to flare
like this.

309
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:19,960
Huh?
You see?

310
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,294
Julian, they just
painted that.

311
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:24,064
Hmm?
She's an animal.

312
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:26,633
She's in heat, huh?
Good.

313
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,969
You.
What do you think?

314
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,137
Uh, I like it.

315
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,005
You like it?

316
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,506
What's that supposed to mean?

317
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,910
Say you love it
or say you hate it.

318
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:39,646
Anything in between
is pointless.

319
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,647
Wet one, wet one,
wet one.

320
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,115
Come on.

321
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:46,286
You, blue shirt.

322
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,654
Are you here to audition?

323
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,057
Me?
No.

324
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,025
Well, you may
want to consider it.

325
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,126
I like your attitude.

326
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,166
Hello.

327
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,010
If you're gonna rob me,
you should bring a gun.

328
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,078
Pardon me?

329
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,612
The blouse.

330
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,415
It's a knock off
of one of my designs.

331
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:16,950
Oh, it is?
I didn't know.

332
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:20,020
Of course,
that's not the real crime.

333
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,289
The real crime
is how you look in it.

334
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,057
Julian, you're booked
to Milan

335
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,492
the day after the show.

336
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:26,994
And the girls are here.

337
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:27,995
You said you wanted
some fresh faces.

338
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:28,996
Good, good.
No, Don, no.

339
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,430
He did it.

340
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,099
Natalie, he's not
even a suspect.

341
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:33,266
Damn.

342
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,135
Turn around.

343
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,136
Not this time.

344
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,537
Next time.

345
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,140
Oh.
Mmmm.

346
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:43,076
Yes.
Yes, you're perfect.

347
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,444
What's your name?
Sarah.

348
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:45,678
Sarah.

349
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,315
Heaven must be missing
one of its angels.

350
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:50,217
Excuse me.
Sorry, um...

351
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,119
What?
Well, it's nothing.

352
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,287
It's just, uh...

353
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,224
Which one?

354
00:15:57,257 --> 00:16:03,063
The left one's higher
than the other one, isn't it?

355
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,999
Oh, this eyebrow
is a little bit

356
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,434
lower than that one.

357
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,070
Oh, maybe next time, Sarah.

358
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:12,139
Thanks for coming in.

359
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,475
Who are you?

360
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,110
I'm Adrian Monk.

361
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:20,213
I'm with the
San Francisco Police.

362
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:23,150
Yeah, we're looking for
Natasia Zorell.

363
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,617
We'll she's working.

364
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,353
Oh, and do me a favor.

365
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,055
Don't arrest her
until after the show.

366
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,589
She hasn't done anything.

367
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,258
We're actually here
looking into the murder

368
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,625
of Clea Vance.

369
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,561
Well, why?
Isn't that old news?

370
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,364
I thought the killer
was in jail somewhere.

371
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:40,333
I mean, don't you people
read the newspapers?

372
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,269
Did you know her?

373
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:44,137
I know every model
in California

374
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:45,805
and every wannabe.

375
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,042
Clea was
a should-not-have-been.

376
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:52,045
She showed up wasted
to my last show.

377
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,580
Almost ruined me.

378
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,515
Now, let that be a lesson
to you girls.

379
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,118
She ruined my last show
and two hours later

380
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:00,687
the delivery boy killed her.
And I kid you not.

381
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,823
We'd still
like to talk to Natasia.

382
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,558
She's at the beach.

383
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,060
We are shooting
our new catalogue.

384
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:09,129
Listen, I've got
to be there very soon.

385
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,331
So you can follow me
if you like.

386
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,200
All right, good.

387
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,267
I'll meet you there.

388
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:18,405
I gotta go pick up Julie.
And change.

389
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,074
Okay, that's it.
That's what I need.

390
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:23,176
Keep it going.
Sell it.

391
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,144
Sell it.
There we go.

392
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,778
Again.

393
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,247
Good.
Sell it.

394
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,216
Sell it.

395
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,089
Sweetie, stay right here,
okay?

396
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:39,126
I'll be back.

397
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,842
What are you doing?

398
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,778
What?
I'm standing.

399
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:02,182
This is how I stand.

400
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,716
What are you wearing?

401
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,852
Clothes.
This is how I dress.

402
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:10,089
This is how I stand.
This is how I dress.

403
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:21,868
Excuse me, would you
put that out?

404
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:24,271
It's bothering me.

405
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,339
But you're smoking.

406
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,640
My smoke
isn't bothering me.

407
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:29,542
Thank you.

408
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,244
All right,
she'll talk to you.

409
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:34,814
But make it quick.

410
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,184
I'm not paying her
$1,000 an hour just to chat.

411
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,351
Uh, thank you.
Can you give us a minute?

412
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:39,919
Sure--all right, everybody,
take ten.

413
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,155
Let's get her
in the other dress, please.

414
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:44,791
Sweetheart, oh,
you look ravishing.

415
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,493
These gentlemen are from
the police department.

416
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:49,196
They want to talk to you
about Clea Vance.

417
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,430
Why?
I don't know.

418
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,665
We're probably
just tilting at windmills.

419
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:55,235
Windmills?

420
00:18:55,268 --> 00:19:00,907
It's a literary reference.
From a book.

421
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,176
Um, I guess I can talk
while I change.

422
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,547
Um, meet me over there?

423
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:15,355
Only one of you.

424
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:17,257
Okay.

425
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,958
I guess the only fair way
is alphabetically.

426
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,693
Oh, Adrian.

427
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,662
Last names.

428
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,331
So A is, no.

429
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:25,665
Uh, B, no.
C, no.

430
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:26,666
D, Disher.
That's--

431
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,201
Monk, you go.

432
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:30,603
It's your case.

433
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,642
Disher comes before Monk.

434
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,448
What are you,
in mourning for your life?

435
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:52,659
You were Clea's roommate.

436
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,793
Yeah, and best friend.

437
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:57,697
I see.
I see.

438
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,765
I see.
Oh.

439
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,633
Oh--oh.
Oh, whoa!

440
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,235
Whoa whoa whoa.

441
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:03,236
Whoa whoa whoa.

442
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,237
It's okay, I'm not shy.

443
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:06,473
You have a, uh...

444
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:07,607
You have a uh, something.

445
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,675
Oh, it's a mole.

446
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,612
It's my trademark.

447
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:13,880
Did you know Pablo Ortiz?

448
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,748
I didn't know him.

449
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:16,983
Except that Cleo
was terrified of him.

450
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,918
He was stalking her.

451
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,521
There's no evidence of that.

452
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,291
No phone calls.
No other moles.

453
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:26,826
Witnesses.
No other witnesses.

454
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,961
Are you saying
I made it all up?

455
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:29,996
Um...
Why would I do that?

456
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:32,031
I don't know.

457
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,600
Look, I saw what I saw.

458
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,868
He brought her flowers,
he hit on her.

459
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,037
I already testified
about all this a year ago.

460
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,506
I read your statement.

461
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,641
Then read it again.

462
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:46,713
What are you doing?

463
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,749
If you...
put one on this side...

464
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:52,419
you know,
you'd be perfect.

465
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,020
Your career would...

466
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:57,457
Do you have
any more questions?

467
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,526
No.
Good.

468
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,028
'Cause I gotta
get back to work.

469
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:06,599
Hey.

470
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:11,371
How'd it go?

471
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:12,805
She's hot.

472
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:17,009
Ah, she's mildly irritated.

473
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:20,347
Give her a minute,
she'll calm down.

474
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:24,984
All right, great.
You look beautiful.

475
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,053
Keep going.
Great.

476
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:28,555
Hi.
Sweetie.

477
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,823
Mom, I got bored.
Please, can I stay?

478
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:31,824
I won't say anything.

479
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:32,859
Shh sh sh sh.
Watch.

480
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:39,599
Mom, that man's
looking at me.

481
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,800
What's he doing?
I don't know.

482
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:41,968
Mr. Hodge?

483
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,503
Shh.
Who is she?

484
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:44,504
Who are you?

485
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:45,938
This is my daughter Julie.

486
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,807
This is Mr. Hodge.

487
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,576
Let me see you walk.
Why?

488
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,878
Because lightning
may be striking.

489
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,480
Your life may be changing.

490
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:57,950
Now, just walk over there.
Come on.

491
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,987
That's it, good.
Turn around.

492
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,722
Hold your head up.
Smile.

493
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,090
Come back.

494
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:05,458
Good.

495
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:06,993
I want you to model for me.

496
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,696
You can be in the show
on Thursday night.

497
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:10,697
Mmm?

498
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:11,898
You know, you could be
a big star.

499
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:14,534
Great and wonderful things.

500
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:15,635
Oh, my God!

501
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,936
No, she's 13 years old.

502
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:18,771
I've had models
younger than that.

503
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:19,972
13?

504
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:20,973
She's practically
middle aged.

505
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,575
Thank you,
I don't think so.

506
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:24,010
Anyway,
it's not up to you.

507
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:27,113
This is between Julie
and her biological mother.

508
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:30,883
I am her biological
mother.

509
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,419
Oh.

510
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,624
No.

511
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,896
Sweetie, come on.
It's gonna get cold!

512
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,676
Are you wearing make-up?

513
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,511
I told you,
not until you're 18.

514
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:00,913
Mom, when I'm 18
it'll be too late.

515
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:02,715
I really wanna do this.

516
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:05,685
A lot of these girls
have serious problems, okay?

517
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,787
Drugs and eating disorders.

518
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,988
It's just one show.

519
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,122
And if you're right
and I hate it,

520
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:13,893
I'll quit.

521
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:16,062
But at least
I'll have tried.

522
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:18,831
You always told me
to try new things.

523
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,969
Forget modeling,
you should be a lawyer.

524
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:26,639
Is that a yes?

525
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:29,041
I'm gonna be with you
the whole time.

526
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:32,479
Wow.
Modeling for Julian Hodge.

527
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:33,946
Isn't he wonderful?

528
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,049
That's not exactly the word
I word I would have used.

529
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,150
[knocking at door]

530
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:44,123
Julian.

531
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,825
Hi.

532
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:47,960
Hey.

533
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:49,228
You surprised?

534
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,997
Not after today.

535
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,766
I figured
you might be freaking out.

536
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,602
Do they know anything?

537
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:57,036
I don't think so.

538
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,071
You're not smoking.

539
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,107
No.
No.

540
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:06,178
You know, cigarettes, they tend
to leave a nasty odor.

541
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:08,014
I wouldn't want them to know
I was here.

542
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:09,982
Who?

543
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,119
The police.

544
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,187
Oh, I didn't
tell them anything.

545
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:19,759
But you will.

546
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:20,793
Eventually.

547
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:24,664
But--
Shh shh shh shh.

548
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,599
It's not your fault,
my darling.

549
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:30,002
You're just too pretty.

550
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:33,706
And beauty likes yours,
a face like this--

551
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,974
Shh.

552
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:39,979
You just wouldn't be able
to take the pressure.

553
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,730
[praying softly]

554
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,318
How's it look, Gordo?

555
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,254
Well, looks like suicide.
Smells like suicide.

556
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:23,890
Smart money's on suicide.

557
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:25,558
She drained two
of those bottles

558
00:25:25,592 --> 00:25:27,994
and maybe
30 sleeping pills.

559
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,328
Were those prescription?

560
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,830
Probably not.

561
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,865
We'll check with her doctor.
Make a note.

562
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,133
I'll remember.

563
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,102
Where's your notebook?

564
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:38,037
I didn't bring it.

565
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:41,741
It's an Italian suit.
It was ruining the lines.

566
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:42,742
Don't worry.

567
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,076
[clicks tongue]
I got it.

568
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,846
[clicks tongue]
Am I in your way?

569
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,783
She probably got depressed
after you spoke to her.

570
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:51,818
All those memories of
the murder bubbling up.

571
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:53,185
I don't think so.

572
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:56,623
One set of fingerprints
on the glass.

573
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:57,757
Well, yeah.
They're hers.

574
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,727
But look.
She's wearing lipstick.

575
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,895
There's no lipstick
on the glass.

576
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:06,733
Somebody wiped down
the glass

577
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:08,801
and then put it back
in her hand.

578
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:10,970
Okay.

579
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:13,673
This is now
a homicide investigation.

580
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:16,809
Lock this joint down.
Nobody touches anything.

581
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:18,811
Fabio, go and borrow
a notebook

582
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:21,113
and borrow a pencil and start
talking to neighbors.

583
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:23,950
Captain, what do
you think it means?

584
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:26,285
It means that your boss
scared somebody.

585
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:38,898
Rest in peace.

586
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:53,713
Hmm. Oh! She looks
beautiful, doesn't she?

587
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:55,748
Oh, too beautiful.

588
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,784
Sometimes I wish she had
a big old fat hairy wart

589
00:26:57,817 --> 00:26:58,851
right here.

590
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:01,053
Or maybe here.

591
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:03,022
Everyone, could you
just come around here

592
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:04,824
for a moment, please?
Thank you.

593
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:06,726
Yes, put that down.
That's okay.

594
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:07,894
Do that later. Thank you.

595
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:10,663
I just want to say
a few quick words.

596
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,267
This has been a terrible
day for us today.

597
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,870
As you know,
last night we lost

598
00:27:17,904 --> 00:27:20,439
a dear, dear friend.

599
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:24,010
And I know all
of you here, everyone,

600
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:27,213
how much we loved Natasia.

601
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:30,449
Except of course when
she was driving us nuts.

602
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:34,220
[chuckles]
But I can feel her here.

603
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:37,890
I can feel her spirit,
her soul.

604
00:27:37,924 --> 00:27:39,726
Can you feel it?

605
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,761
And I know she's going
to be with us

606
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:43,930
tomorrow night at the show.

607
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:48,034
So, let's not
let her down. Huh?

608
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:50,036
Good.

609
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:52,038
Mwah.

610
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:54,874
This one's for you, baby.

611
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,776
Great. Thank you.

612
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:08,755
* On a starry winter
night in Portugal *

613
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:15,094
* Where the ocean
kissed the southern shore *

614
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:18,865
You know, you may want to
change the earrings, I think.

615
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:20,733
Maybe her give an accessory

616
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:23,803
like a nice little bag
or something.

617
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:26,172
Hmm. That's great.

618
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:30,877
* Through an hourglass

619
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:34,747
* You made love to me
like fire and rain *

620
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:38,117
* Ooh, you know you've got
to be a hurricane *

621
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,888
* Killing me with kisses
so subtly *

622
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:45,291
* You make love
forever, baby *

623
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,326
(Hodge)
Oh, yes. Make a note.

624
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:50,296
Just change those earrings.

625
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:53,532
Cut! Cut!
Cut, cut, cut, cut!

626
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,869
Julie, Julie, Julie.

627
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:58,404
Haven't you forgotten
something?

628
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,439
Huh?
What?

629
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,842
Have you forgot that
when it comes to my art

630
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:04,176
I'm a total monster?

631
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,112
I mean, just look
at yourself. Look at--

632
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:08,014
You're a mess!
I mean, look here.

633
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:09,882
Look at this.
Look at the collar.

634
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,851
(Hodge)
Look. It's all twisted.

635
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:13,920
And all these wrinkles
on the dress.

636
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:15,855
I mean,
look, sweetheart...

637
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:17,857
Natalie, give me
the case file.

638
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,158
What?
The case file.

639
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:20,459
Give it to me.

640
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,194
I mean, I'd rather put you
in a burlap bag

641
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:24,831
than have you seen wearing
my clothes like this.

642
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,099
I knew something
was wrong. Look.

643
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:30,336
Look at this.
Her body is all contorted.

644
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:32,304
But the collar
and her buttons

645
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:34,040
are all perfectly
straight.

646
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:37,143
After he killed her,
he straightened them out.

647
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:39,178
He couldn't help himself.

648
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:43,315
He's the guy.
Who's the guy?

649
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:47,419
Julie, we have to go
right now.

650
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:48,888
Why?
I can't tell you now.

651
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:50,923
Not here. Do not
argue with me!

652
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:52,024
Get your stuff now.

653
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:55,061
Hey, what--Oh!

654
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:56,863
Look, what's going on?

655
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:59,165
She's taking Julie home.

656
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:02,835
Well, why on Earth
would she do that?

657
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:04,103
Because I told her

658
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:07,573
that you killed
Clea Vance a year ago.

659
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:09,876
And I'm betting

660
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:12,845
that you killed
Natasia Zorell last night.

661
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:15,014
Who else would've
straightened the clothes

662
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:17,016
on Clea Vance's body?

663
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,886
Oh. And why would I do
something like that?

664
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:23,289
I would have.

665
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:27,026
Is that it? I straightened
out the clothes?

666
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,895
[laughs]
I mean, that's not evidence.

667
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:30,596
That's--that's a hunch.

668
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:33,532
That's all it is.

669
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,901
So far.

670
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:37,369
You trust your instincts,
don't you?

671
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:39,371
Oh, yes.

672
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:41,507
And would it be the same
infallible instinct

673
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:45,644
that you used when you
picked out that jacket?

674
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,579
Or when you did
those buttons

675
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:50,917
right up to top
on your shirt, eh?

676
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,652
[laughs]
What about
the evidence, Mr. Monk?

677
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,488
What about--
You've heard of DNA, right?

678
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,891
I mean, does that ring
a bell here?

679
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:00,893
Hmm?
DNA, yes.

680
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:02,094
The fibers, the hair,
and the blood.

681
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:04,596
They all belonged
to that boy Pablo Ortiz.

682
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,398
Who's in jail.

683
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:09,301
It couldn't have been me.

684
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:12,338
Just not possible.

685
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,673
You're right.

686
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,909
It's not possible.

687
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:21,213
But you did it.

688
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:32,358
Gordo. Thanks for getting
here so fast.

689
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,392
Sure. What's going on?

690
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:34,560
Get a load of this.

691
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:35,928
Okay. There was
a fashion show

692
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:37,063
upstairs
in the ballroom.

693
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:38,297
I remember.
Last year.

694
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,666
Right. And one of
the models, as you know,

695
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:41,700
showed up drunk.

696
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,669
Clea Vance.
Exactly.

697
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,537
So drunk, according
to Julian Hodge,

698
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,639
that she almost
ruined his show.

699
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:48,941
He was furious.

700
00:31:48,975 --> 00:31:51,010
I think he followed her
down here.

701
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:52,644
They argued.
He lost control.

702
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:53,679
He killed her.

703
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:55,181
He beat her to death
right here.

704
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:58,184
Julian Hodge?
What about the evidence?

705
00:31:58,217 --> 00:32:00,586
He planted it.
He framed Pablo Ortiz.

706
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:02,121
Is that possible?

707
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,522
How could he plant
all that evidence

708
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:05,324
and clean up every
trace of himself?

709
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:07,026
Actually, he didn't.
He missed something.

710
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:08,094
Check this out.

711
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:09,661
See, there was a health
inspection the day before.

712
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:11,663
They hung that flypaper
in the corner.

713
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:12,364
How'd we miss it?

714
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:14,633
We just found it
this morning.

715
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:15,601
Behind that radiator.

716
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,236
It must've fallen
back there

717
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,737
during the fight.
And look.

718
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,506
There's three or four
hairs stuck to it.

719
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:21,573
And they can't be
from Clea Vance

720
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:22,975
because she had
long hair.

721
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:25,111
The must belong
to Julian Hodge.

722
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:26,145
The real killer.

723
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:27,413
This is the proof we need.

724
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,580
How soon can you do
a test on those?

725
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,549
I'll get right on it.
Good work.

726
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:32,551
Thanks.

727
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:39,391
Honey, I think
they're done.

728
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,198
Ooh. Maybe a little
overdone.

729
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,269
Julie?

730
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,074
Honey?

731
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:17,563
[bell rings]

732
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,815
(doorman)
I don't have
a John Carlo, okay?

733
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,550
How many times
I have to tell you?

734
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:39,618
You're not on
the list, all right?

735
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,653
Good night. Thank you.

736
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:45,757
Good night!

737
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:48,127
Hello.
I'm on the list.

738
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,629
Name.
Puff Daddy.

739
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:53,465
Plus one.
This is my girlfriend.

740
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:54,533
Hi.

741
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:56,068
Puff Daddy the rapper?

742
00:33:56,102 --> 00:33:58,404
Oh, no.
Not that Puff Daddy.

743
00:33:58,437 --> 00:33:59,605
This happens to me
all the time, doesn't it?

744
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:01,140
All the time.
Yeah.

745
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:04,143
Let me explain.
Where to begin?

746
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:05,544
All right, there are
two Puff Daddys.

747
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,146
Why don't you change
your name?

748
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:10,116
Why doesn't he change
his name is what I'm saying.

749
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:12,584
I'm older than him.
I had it first.

750
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:14,786
One time a lawyer told me
I could sue if I--

751
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,455
My daughter's in there.
I'm going in.

752
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:19,091
We gotta go in there.
Hey, hey! Hey!

753
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,230
[disco music]

754
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:32,271
*

755
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:21,620
Have you seen
my daughter?

756
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:27,393
Have you seen, uh,
my daughter Julie?

757
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:28,794
She's 13,
long, blond hair.

758
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:31,430
(Hodge)
Beautiful.

759
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:32,798
And there's little Julie.

760
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,900
Good, she looks
very good.

761
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,610
[gasps]
Julie!

762
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:49,748
Natalie,
don't eat the food.

763
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:52,284
I just saw four models
back there throwing up.

764
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:53,852
Julie!

765
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,187
Come...

766
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:08,834
That's not my design!
Make an announcement.

767
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,909
[whispering]
You can't just
run away from me like that!

768
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:19,645
You scared me
to death!

769
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:20,912
You know,
if we have a problem,

770
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:22,448
we need to talk about it,
all right?

771
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:23,682
I thought
we were partners.

772
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:24,683
[hissing]
Get off!

773
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:29,221
You say I can't do this,
and you don't even tell me why.

774
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:30,422
What kind of partner
are you?

775
00:36:30,456 --> 00:36:31,690
I had my reasons,
all right?

776
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:33,259
There are grown-up things
happening here.

777
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,826
There are dangerous things.

778
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,695
You have to trust me,
honey.

779
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:40,999
I'm sorry.

780
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,734
I'm sorry too.

781
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:43,802
Oh, God.

782
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:46,805
All right?
You're so grounded.

783
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:50,976
[chatter]

784
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,449
Well, look, here's
to our next show in Milan.

785
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:59,651
Cin-cin.
All the best.

786
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:02,788
And congratulations.
You look stunning in that dress.

787
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:04,690
Fabulous.

788
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,024
That was a great
show tonight.

789
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,593
Really fabulous.

790
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,728
Except for that one little
incident with that midget.

791
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,730
[laughter]

792
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:14,800
That was ridiculous.
Ugh.

793
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:17,636
Cin-cin.

794
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:18,904
Hmm.

795
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,806
(Hodge)
Oh, that's delicious,
isn't it?

796
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:21,873
Delicious!

797
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,475
Mm-hmm-hmm.

798
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:24,776
I want to get you
new earrings.

799
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,778
I want them
to be drops.

800
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:29,648
Oh! Look what
the cat dragged in.

801
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:31,617
You know, you nearly
ruined my show.

802
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,051
You nearly
ruined my daughter.

803
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,820
Hmm.
Mr. Hodge, hello!

804
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:36,288
Oh...hello.

805
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:37,889
Great party.
Thank you.

806
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:39,891
There's somebody here
I'd really love for you to meet.

807
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,393
There he is.

808
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:42,661
(Stottlemeyer)
Come on.
Now?

809
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,029
Oh, yeah.
Can't it wait?

810
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,031
No, no, no.
He's very important.

811
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:51,703
Julian Hodge...

00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:53,705
I'd like you to meet
Howard Gordon.

813
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:55,541
Howard is one of our
forensic experts.

814
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:56,875
Oh.
How do you do?

815
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:59,044
He's been examining
some evidence

816
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:02,013
that we just uncovered
in the Clea Vance case.

817
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:03,482
What, new evidence?

818
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:04,783
That's right--four
strands of human hair

819
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:06,518
found at the scene
of the crime.

820
00:38:06,552 --> 00:38:08,086
For the record, Gordo,
is this your report?

821
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,355
For the record,
yes, it is.

822
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:10,689
Uh-huh,
and you examined

823
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:11,823
these hair samples

824
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:13,359
that we found
earlier today?

825
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:14,560
I did.

826
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:16,928
And were you able to match
these hairs to any individual?

827
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,465
(Gordo)
Yes, sir.

828
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:20,999
And for the record,
who do these hairs belong to?

829
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,901
Pablo Ortiz.

830
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:24,670
Ortiz!

831
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:26,705
Isn't that the boy
who's already in jail

832
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:27,806
for the murder?

833
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,608
[laughs]
Well...

834
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,943
I think, gentlemen,
we're finished here.

835
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,645
Don't mind if I
get back to my party?

836
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,713
Hang on.

837
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:36,114
Hang on.

838
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,850
Gordo, I'm sorry,
but you're under arrest.

839
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:41,119
Accessory to Murder
and Falsifying Evidence.

840
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,554
What?!

841
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:44,055
Here's what I couldn't
figure out.

842
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:45,557
If you were guilty,

843
00:38:45,591 --> 00:38:48,394
how could all the evidence
point somewhere else?

844
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:51,497
There could be only one
possible answer.

845
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,699
There was something wrong
with the evidence.

846
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:55,467
(Stottlemeyer)
We did some digging, Gordo.

847
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:57,102
You did make a lot of money
this year,

848
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:58,704
but it wasn't
in real estate.

849
00:38:58,737 --> 00:38:59,838
Here's what happened.

850
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:02,674
(Monk)
When you did the forensic work

851
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:04,075
on the Clea Vance murder,

852
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:08,747
you realized all the evidence
pointed to Julian Hodge.

853
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,782
And you decided
to cash in.

854
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:16,154
You made Hodge an offer
he was in no position to refuse.

855
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,658
For a price, you'd bury
the evidence against him.

856
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,693
There was only
one problem.

857
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:23,829
You had to close
the case.

858
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,697
You needed a fall guy.

859
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:27,433
Hodge remembered
a young delivery boy

860
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:29,100
named Pablo Ortiz,
a poor kid,

861
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:30,969
barely spoke
any English.

862
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:32,738
He was
a perfect patsy.

863
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:34,606
Hodge got Natasia
to help him.

864
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,841
She called the police

865
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,644
and accused Ortiz
of stalking her roommate.

866
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:40,712
The police arrested Pablo.

867
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:43,782
They took hair and blood samples
and sent them to you.

868
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:46,718
And the rest was easy.

869
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:50,422
All you had to do
was re-label them.

870
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:53,825
Pablo never had a chance.

871
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:55,427
You can't prove
any of this.

872
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:56,495
We don't have to.

873
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:58,730
You proved it for us
five minutes ago

874
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:00,799
when you swore
that these hair samples

875
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:02,768
belonged to Pablo Ortiz.

876
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:05,504
So you planted that hair
to test him?

877
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:08,440
Well...yeah.

878
00:40:08,474 --> 00:40:09,741
[sighs]
Whose hair was it?

879
00:40:09,775 --> 00:40:11,009
It was mine.

880
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:12,911
Natalie pulled it out
with a tweezer.

881
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:14,646
She just yanked it out.

882
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,047
What was I
supposed to do?

883
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:17,749
You could have cut them,
like I told you.

884
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:18,817
We needed the follicles.

885
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:19,885
No, we didn't
need the follicles

886
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,787
because we knew he wasn't
going to test anything.

887
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,754
That was
the whole point.

888
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:24,222
Don't be such a baby.
It's embarrassing me.

889
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,223
Hang on.

890
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,925
Hang on!

891
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,927
I forgot
what we were doing.

892
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,862
Oh, yeah,
we're arresting you two.

893
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:33,765
You know the drill,
Gordo.

894
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:38,737
So, it's true
what they say, huh?

895
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,707
You can never judge a person
by how they dress.

896
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,509
Well, you know what?

897
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:45,477
Let me tell you what
you're gonna be wearing.

898
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:47,746
I hope you like orange.
It's a little jumpsuit thing.

899
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:48,847
Has a number right here.

900
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,148
You can wear it
anywhere, really.

901
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,718
Indoors, walking
around the yard.

902
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:05,731
[crying]
Ay, mijo.

903
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:07,633
Es un milagro.

904
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:09,968
[speaking Spanish]

905
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:11,136
Mamá.

906
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:13,772
Ven, ven, ven.

907
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,907
Thank you, Mr. Monk.

908
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:18,043
(Maria)
How can I repay you,
Mr. Monk?

909
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,811
I have no money.

910
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:23,081
Now that you mention it,
it is only 2:30.

911
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:25,050
If we left now,
you could be back at work

912
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:28,253
at 3:15,
put in a couple of hours,

913
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:30,889
inspect, what, 90,
maybe 100 shirts.

914
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:32,858
But I took the day off.

915
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,059
No, no, no, no.

916
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:35,661
You don't
wanna do that, no.

917
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:37,128
You're Inspector
Number Eight.

918
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:38,864
You have a lot of people
depending on you.

919
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:40,566
I'm sure they would
like to visit.

920
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:41,900
You know, catch up.

921
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:43,769
Yeah, there's plenty
of time for that.

922
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:45,604
They got the whole
weekend for that.

923
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:47,806
Unless you want
to work on Saturday.

924
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,009
Puedes trabajar Saturday...
Sábado?

925
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,011
Shh!
No? Domingo?

926
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:54,045
Overtime, overtime.

927
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,148
