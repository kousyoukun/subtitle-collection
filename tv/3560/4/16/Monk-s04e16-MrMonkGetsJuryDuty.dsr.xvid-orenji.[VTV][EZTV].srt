1
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:04,768
<i>Out of the way!</i>
<i>Out of the way!</i>

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:08,774
This is Disher!
We're in pursuit on foot!
West on Jackson.

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:12,243
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
Repeat, armed and dangerous!
<i>Out of the way!</i>

4
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:15,281
He's wearing a beige suit
and a purple shirt.

5
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,942
<i>I think it's purple.</i>
<i>It might be lavender or mauve.</i>
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,952
Randy, nobody cares
about the shirt!

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,717
- Request backup!
We need backup!

8
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,130
- Freeze! Freeze! Let the girl go!
- Don't move!

9
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,696
- Put the gun down!
- Let the girl go, Escobar!

10
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,300
I swear to God, I'll kill her!
<i>Everybody relax.</i>

11
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,039
- Let the girl go.
- You put the gun down now!

12
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:50,310
- Okay.
- Put it down. Put it down.

13
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,374
Okay.

14
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,655
That's him.
That's Miguel Escobar.
We just saw him on the news.

15
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,661
- He's the number one
most-wanted man.
- Yeah, not anymore.

16
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,220
Can you do me a favor, Captain?
Shut up!

17
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:09,064
Call my fiancée and tell her
that the wedding's still on.
And don't cancel anything.

18
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:12,571
Tell her I'll be back home
in Bogotá, Colombia, real soon.

19
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,937
Yeah, right.

20
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,093
Good morning.

21
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,762
Picked up your mail.
What is going on?

22
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:21,864
Ah, I'm having fun.
I love this stuff.
Yeah, so I see.

23
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,932
You know, I usually don't like
shaking hands,

24
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,808
but if I ever met the man
who invented Tupperware,

25
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,044
- I would shake his hand.
- I think he might be dead.

26
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:34,985
I would still shake his hand, because
he's probably perfectly preserved.
Look.

27
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,579
It's virtually airtight.
Look at this.

28
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,591
Uh-oh.

29
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,526
- "Uh-oh" what?
- "Uh-oh" nothing.
I'll show you later.

30
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,257
What? What... is that?

31
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,164
Don't worry.
You don't have to report for weeks.

32
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,361
Report for what?

33
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:54,031
I've been drafted?
They've reinstated the draft.

34
00:02:56,109 --> 00:03:00,011
Ah, I'm gonna have
to shower with... naked people.

35
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:04,345
Naked-With naked-
naked... men with-

36
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,944
Mr. Monk, you're not being drafted.
You have jury duty.

37
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,955
Oh, my God.

38
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,456
Oh, my God!

39
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,325
Ah, I'm gonna get picked.

40
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,994
Mr. Monk, you're not
gonna get picked.
You're an ex-police officer.

41
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,003
You have tons of friends
on the force.

42
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:28,905
I've been to plenty of trials.
Ex-cops get picked all the time.

43
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,603
I can't believe they're still
renovating this place.

44
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,841
They should put up a sign-
"Your tax dollars not at work."

45
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,277
<i>Mr. Monk, you're not moving.</i>

46
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,757
I'm not?
No. You're not.

47
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:50,023
Here we go. Here we go.
Go on.

48
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,087
There you go.

49
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,396
You're walkin'.
Look at you.

50
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,993
I'm so proud of you.

51
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,005
I'm gonna get picked.

52
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,636
Take that, please.

53
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,145
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

54
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,416
Mr. Monk, you're gonna have
to take off your belt.

55
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,585
I was going to anyway-

56
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,788
to hang myself.

57
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,058
Don't get me wrong.
It's a great system.

58
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,864
It really is the best
justice system in the world.

59
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,100
I agree.
I just don't want
to be a part of it.

60
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:37,006
Mr. Monk, what if everybody
felt that way?

61
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,476
Everybody does.

62
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,877
<i>Department</i>
<i>of Animal Services Employees...</i>

63
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,356
<i>Mr. Monk, I don't understand.</i>

64
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,364
You've dedicated your life
to fighting crimes, right?

65
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,731
Solving mysteries,
sending guilty people to jail.

66
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,862
Well, you can do that here.
That's what juries do.
It's the same thing.

67
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,805
But I work alone.
I'm a lone wolf.

68
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,400
- You're a lone wolf?
- Even when I was on the force,

69
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,638
I didn't really like having a partner.

70
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,704
I can't work with other people.

71
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,751
Okay. Well, I think that's kinda sad.
I agree.

72
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,184
It's very sad.

73
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:24,246
You know, I hope you do get picked.
I think it'd be good for you.

74
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,088
Don't say that.
Yeah. You work with
different kinds of people.

75
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,460
You know, you listen to their opinions,
argue, compromise.

76
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:35,592
Thank you, Natalie.
I- I know you mean well.

77
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,398
I'd rather be sucked
out of an airplane window.

78
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,736
<i>Good afternoon. I am live in front</i>
<i>of the San Francisco Police Department-</i>

79
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,675
Look. It's the captain.
<i>where we're waiting</i>
<i>for Miguel Escobar to return...</i>

80
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,678
from his pre-trial arraignment.

81
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,737
Here he is. Sergeant?
Sgt. Stottlemeyer? Excuse me.

82
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,545
Can we get a word, please?
Excuse me. Sgt. Stottlemeyer?
No comment.

83
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:55,212
Actually, it's Captain.
Yeah, Captain Leland Stottlemeyer
with three T's.

84
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,222
Uh, four if you count
the one in "Captain."

85
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,555
<i>Escobar has already escaped twice.</i>
<i>Do you think he'll try again?</i>

86
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:04,062
We're taking every precaution
to avoid that.
<i>Isn't that what they said last time?</i>

87
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,098
I wasn't in charge last time.

88
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,402
<i>Hello? Did everybody sign in?</i>

89
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:17,239
<i>If I call your name,</i>
<i>you are required to come back</i>
<i>tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m...</i>

90
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,575
and report to room 302.

91
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:23,308
<i>If you do not hear your name,</i>

92
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,876
you are excused.

93
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,887
Here it comes.

94
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,123
Adrian Monk.

95
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,557
There it is.

96
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,754
Mmm!

97
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,059
Mmm! Mmm!

98
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,362
<i>Yes!</i>
<i>Swish!</i>

99
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,027
<i>Mmm!</i>

100
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:48,039
Is this a bad time?

101
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,268
Yeah. It is now.

102
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:54,609
Randy, you remember
Special Agent Lapides.

103
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,672
Actually I'm not alone.
I'm here with the attorney general.

104
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,945
The attorney general
of the United States?

105
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,283
He's in here.
You want to read it?

106
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,085
I don't need to read it.
I'm not giving you Escobar.

107
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,092
No way, no how.

108
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,287
Leland, this case is bigger
than San Francisco.

109
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,353
Escobar was supplying drugs
to seven states.

110
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,456
Yeah, but we caught him here.
Damn right we did,

111
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,263
and we got him on homicide
right here in the city
of San Francisco.

112
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,360
This case represents
three years of my life.

113
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,497
Well, you have the thanks
of a grateful nation.

114
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,167
But it's a done deal.
A federal indictment's
already been filed.

115
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,176
<i>We're gonna try him first.</i>

116
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,077
- Sons of bitches.
- There's an extradition
hearing on Thursday.

117
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:31,310
Here's how it's gonna work-
You babysit Escobar until then.

118
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:35,320
You bring him to the courthouse.
We meet you in the lobby.
You drop him off, you go home.

119
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,287
What's this, sir?
Yeah. I'll tell him.

120
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,658
<i>The attorney general says,</i>

121
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:46,289
"Don't screw it up."

122
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,906
Mr. Daughtry, it says here...

123
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,875
that you've been excused
from jury duty three times before?

124
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,912
Yeah. I got a business to run.

125
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,880
Well, you're going to have
to find someone else to run it.

126
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,146
The defense accepts you.
So does the prosecution, and so do I.

127
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,052
<i>Have a seat.</i>
<i>You're Juror Number 10.</i>

128
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:12,090
<i>Okay. Next. Stand up.</i>

129
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,649
<i>State your name.</i>
Uh, Natalie Teeger.

130
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,389
- Spell it.
- Oh, no. I wasn't called.

131
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,829
She's my assistant, Your Honor.

132
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,424
And you are?

133
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:28,441
Adrian Monk.
Capital "A," small "D," small "R,"
small "I," small "A," small "N," space-

134
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,874
Thank you, Mr. Monk.
I think we have it.

135
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,604
Your Honor,

136
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,013
I will not be able
to serve today, unfortunately,

137
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,019
<i>for a number of reasons.</i>

138
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:44,545
First off, uh-

139
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:48,685
There's the bathroom situation.

140
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,924
I can't <i>share</i> a bathroom.

141
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,966
<i>I just can't.</i>
<i>You can ask Natalie.</i>

142
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,901
Natalie?
Yeah. He's persnickety.
He's very persnickety.

143
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,336
He's persnickety squared.

144
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:04,706
And I have special
dietary needs, Your Honor.

145
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:10,511
I can't eat food unless
I actually... see it being prepared.

146
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,608
That's true, Your Honor.

147
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:17,619
- Anything else?
- Yes, sir.

148
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:27,998
I have... two plants at home
that are completely dependent
on me, Your Honor.

149
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,501
Plants?

150
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,564
I have a fern.
A small azalea bush.

151
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:39,077
And you have an assistant.
Can't she water the plants?

152
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,670
Good question.
Here's the thing.

153
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,274
She has a tendency to overwater.
Okay, that's not true.
That happened once.

154
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,319
More than once.
It was two ounces.

155
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,616
Two ounces to an azalea bush
is like a swimming pool-

156
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,624
<i>Okay, wait-</i>
Mr. Monk, I have seen...

157
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,752
hundreds of people pretend
to be disturbed to avoid jury duty,

158
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,921
but you, sir, are in a class
by yourself.

159
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,966
You're too kind.
<i>Well, it's not going</i>
<i>to work, sir.</i>

160
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,298
You have a seat, Mr. Monk.

161
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,828
- Objection.
- You are Juror Number 11.

162
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,978
It's okay, Mr. Palmer.
Take your time.

163
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,675
Could you show us
exactly where you were stabbed?

164
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,851
Right here- in the thigh.

165
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,394
Mr. Monk, you have to look.

166
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,521
Just-
<i>Number 11.</i>

167
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,861
Evidence is presented, sir, for you.

168
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,569
What did you do then?

169
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,630
I was bleeding pretty bad,
so I grabbed an old towel
out of my car-

170
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:45,199
There was one on the floor-
and I pressed it against the wound.

171
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:48,405
Whose phone was that?

172
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,178
It's hers, Your Honor.
Number Three.

173
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,553
And she fell asleep.

174
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:59,682
- <i>Yeah, you.</i>
<i>Number Eight, Your Honor.</i>
- Nobody likes a tattletale, Mr. Monk.

175
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,693
I think Number Nine is a tattletale.

176
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,729
<i>That'll do, Mr. Monk.</i>

177
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,728
Proceed, Mr. Fox.

178
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,963
What happened
after you were stabbed?

179
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,996
He grabbed my deposit envelope
and took off.

180
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,373
Karl, is the person that stabbed you
at that rest stop,

181
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,106
took your money and ran away
in this courtroom today?

182
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,876
Yes, sir. He's right there.

183
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,281
What are you doing?

184
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,726
- He-He needs a wipe, Your Honor.
- Sit down, Miss Teeger.

185
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:40,527
<i>Sit down. Now, if you interfere</i>
<i>with the jury again-</i>

186
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,760
<i>I will have you arrested</i>
<i>for tampering and contempt.</i>

187
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:46,794
- Understand?
- Yes, sir. Sorry.

188
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:51,241
Let the record show that
the witness has identified
the defendant,

189
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,370
Robert Perry.

190
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,918
Oh, my God.

191
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,825
No cellphones are allowed.
You'll get 'em back
when you're done.

192
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,763
<i>I'll be down the hallway.</i>
<i>If you need me,</i>
<i>just ring the buzzer.</i>

193
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,269
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>
<i>None for you. Okay.</i>

194
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:20,772
What did you think?
I thought it was pretty interesting.

195
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,435
Very interesting.
I filled up three notebooks.

196
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,671
It's on.

197
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:44,124
What are you doing?
I'm just making them even.

198
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:49,065
So we can all concentrate
and not be distracted...

199
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,467
by uneven venetian blinds.

200
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,404
Okay, everyone, let's get started.

201
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:59,137
I've done this before, so, um,
I would be glad to be our foreman,
if there are no objections.

202
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,840
<i>No.</i>
<i>All right. Great.</i>
<i>Well, let's all have a seat.</i>

203
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:07,648
Actually, it'd be best
if we all sat in order,
if you don't mind.

204
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,657
I'm Juror Number Seven,
then we'll go this way-
Number Eight, so forth.

205
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,659
Okay. Great.

206
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,795
You look happy.

207
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:21,492
This is very exciting for me.
I feel like a real American.

208
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:25,526
Excuse me.
Do you mind if we tr- traded seats?
Yeah? Why?

209
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:30,064
Well, I'd rather be number 10.
My favorite number, and-

210
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,804
- It's kind of important to me.
- Look, the guy is trying
to change seats.

211
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:37,008
You know what, pal?
Nobody's trading anything with you.
Now sit down. Okay?

212
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,880
<i>I mean it. Sit. Okay?</i>

213
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,656
So I've been on a few juries,
and it's customary...

214
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,990
to start off with a preliminary vote
by secret ballot...

215
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,996
just to see where we all are.

216
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:55,158
Any objections? Great.
No.

217
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,532
<i>Thank you.</i>

218
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,631
There you go.
Thanks.

219
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,943
Anybody mind if I, uh, smoke?

220
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,173
<i>Oh, please don't smoke.</i>

221
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:12,684
All right, all right, all right.
I'm not the one on trial.
Okay, folks? Huh?

222
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:15,015
Just pass them down, please.

223
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,555
<i>All right. Well, let's do this.</i>

224
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,557
"Guilty."

225
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,493
"Guilty."

226
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,953
"Guilty." "Guilty."

227
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:35,607
"Guilty."

228
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:39,235
"Guilty." "Guilty."

229
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,047
"Guilty."

230
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,551
"Guilty."

231
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:50,146
<i>Wow, that was easy.</i>
<i>Guess I'll be home for dinner.</i>

232
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:54,556
Wait a minute. That was only 11.
Who didn't vote?

233
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,436
Smudge.

234
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,863
You got to be kidding.

235
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,780
Oh-

236
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,138
- Thank you.
- It's no problem.

237
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,544
"Not guilty."

238
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,550
That makes it 11 to one.

239
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,643
There's always one, isn't there?
Always one.

240
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:32,817
- Do you really think he's not guilty?
- I don't know.

241
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,416
Of course he's guilty.
Look at the evidence.

242
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:39,521
They found the knife-
the knife he used- in his knapsack.

243
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,931
Plus, the victim identified him.
I mean, what more do you want?

244
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:47,063
I don't know.
I have a feeling there's more to it.

245
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,073
<i>A feeling.</i>

246
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,735
I would just like
to think about it for a while.

247
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,143
What do you need to think about?
There's nothing to think about!
There's nothing to-

248
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,705
He's guilty.

249
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,876
I'm gonna need you all to be quiet.

250
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,546
Yeah, you'll get quiet right here.
Let me concentrate.

251
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:06,717
Shh. I'm gonna walk around now
and pace back and forth.

252
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:10,626
Then when I'm ready,
I'll tell you the solution.
That's how it works.

253
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,061
No. No way.

254
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,069
You're not alone here.

255
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,971
You have to talk to us.
Tell us what you're thinking.

256
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,771
That's not how I do it.
I have a system.

257
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,744
It's a gift and a curse.
Here's the thing.

258
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,906
I don't like working with partners.

259
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,815
Well, like it or not,
you've got 11 partners now.

260
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,117
Pay attention.
I'm only gonna say this once.

261
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,752
Escobar's hearing
is tomorrow at 12:00 noon.

262
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,558
We lock this joint down
tonight at midnight-

263
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,997
every exit, every window.

264
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,161
1:00 a.m., we sweep for bombs,
head to toe.

265
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:56,196
6:00 a.m., I want snipers
on this roof and on the roof next door.

266
00:17:56,275 --> 00:18:01,838
We arrive at 11:30.
At 11:40, we meet Lapides
at the elevator and hand him off.

267
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,042
After that,
he's the bureau's headache.

268
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,950
Sir, could you, uh,
repeat that, please?
Yeah. What part?

269
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,286
Uh, everything after
"Pay attention.
I'm only gonna say this once."

270
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,201
Exhibit 15B.
Thank you.

271
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,764
<i>What's he doing now?</i>

272
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:34,404
We're not sure.
Did you talk to the judge?

273
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,574
<i>He says it's too late.</i>
<i>He's already sent</i>
<i>the alternates home.</i>

274
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:42,153
You're stuck with him.

275
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,624
<i>Bless you.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

276
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,040
Excuse me.

277
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,172
Would you mind
trying these on?
What for?

278
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,013
You're about the same height
as the victim,

279
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,019
and, uh, I just want
to try something.

280
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:18,523
- It'll just take a minute.
- What do we got?
A fashion show? Huh?

281
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,990
Can you believe this guy?

282
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,789
We know that these are the pants...

283
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:27,559
that the victim
was wearing when he was attacked.

284
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,863
Uh, could you step up, please?

285
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:35,429
Of course, you can see
where the knife
went through the fabric.

286
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,498
Well, something doesn't add up.

287
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:42,377
<i>I notice that Mr. Palmer</i>
<i>likes to wear his pants low.</i>

288
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:47,384
In the courtroom, we could
almost see his... bottom part-

289
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,443
Rear. Posterior. Side-

290
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,921
- His butt?
- Thank you.

291
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,925
Look at the wound.

292
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:59,760
He was actually stabbed
in the upper thigh.

293
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,869
- Doesn't match up.
- He's right. Look at that.

294
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:10,432
At least not when he's standing.
Could you have a seat, please?

295
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,983
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>
<i>He was sitting down.</i>

296
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:23,078
- What does that prove?
- Mr. Palmer said he was
standing up when he was stabbed.

297
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,921
He was lying.
<i>I think</i>
<i>he pulled into that rest stop,</i>

298
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:30,428
saw Robert Perry-
who was sleeping-

299
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:35,330
stabbed himself,
pocketed the money, and then
blamed everything on Perry.

300
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,168
I'm switching my vote...
to not guilty.

301
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,303
<i>Oh, come on.</i>
<i>What? That is ridiculous.</i>
<i>Why would he stab himself?</i>

302
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,906
<i>We- We- We should</i>
<i>listen to this man.</i>

303
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,747
<i>He was a very brave man</i>
<i>to stand up against us all.</i>

304
00:20:56,688 --> 00:21:00,624
<i>What about the DNA evidence?</i>

305
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:05,186
You can't just ignore that.
They found the victim's blood
on Perry's knife.

306
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,290
How do we know
it was Robert Perry's knife?
He denied ever seeing it.

307
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,927
Of course he denied it.
What the hell do you expect?

308
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,767
- Well, his prints weren't on it.
- Well, then he wiped 'em off. Huh?

309
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,307
Look, it was in his knapsack!

310
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,639
Now what the hell
kind of a detective are you?

311
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,612
I'm the kind of detective
who wonders why someone
would take the time...

312
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,878
to wipe down the handle,
but not the blade.

313
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,458
Also, the timeline is all wrong.

314
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:38,690
Robert Perry was picked up
an hour after the assault...

315
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:41,232
<i>less than two miles from there.</i>

316
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,167
So what?
<i>He wasn't running away.</i>

317
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,966
If I had just stabbed somebody-

318
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,837
- Somebody moved that tarp.
- Excuse me?

319
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,676
There's a Dumpster down there
with a tarp in it.

320
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:58,182
<i>Yesterday the tarp was rolled up</i>
<i>and draped over the side.</i>

321
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,413
What does this have to do with us
or this case?

322
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,751
- Or anything.
- I'm sorry.
You're right. You're right.

323
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:08,657
Okay. What's next?
The money. Okay. The money.
What happened to the money?

324
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,025
- Maybe he buried it.
- Lime.

325
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:17,067
Somebody poured lime
all over that tarp.

326
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,103
I think there's a body down there.

327
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,366
Oh, we're never
getting out of here.

328
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,499
Ah-

329
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,244
Hello. I'm Number 11.

330
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,246
Yeah, I remember.
I know this sounds crazy,

331
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,407
but there's a Dumpster downstairs.

332
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,384
<i>I saw a police dog sniffing around.</i>

333
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,854
I think there's a body
under that blue tarp.

334
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,888
<i>Judge Rienzo said I should</i>
<i>keep an eye on you.</i>

335
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,397
He said to report you
if you cause any delay or disruption.

336
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:52,233
Is that what you're doing?
No. Nah, nah. No.

337
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,075
Natalie! Natalie!

338
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,718
Mr. Monk, I brought you
your dinner!

339
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,419
- I'm gonna leave it downstairs!
- Dumpster!

340
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,122
What?
The Dumpster!

341
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,096
It's Natalie.

342
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,131
There's a body in the Dumpster!

343
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,603
You want a hot toddy at Munster?

344
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:30,140
I brought Cobb salad.

345
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,506
<i>There's a body in the Dumpster!</i>

346
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,842
- I just got the Cobb salad!
- What are you talking about?

347
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,280
What are <i>you</i> talking about?

348
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,444
There is a... dead...

349
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,979
body... in the Dumpster!

350
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,790
Call Captain Stottlemeyer!

351
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:53,422
Okay, wait. A body?
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

352
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:56,524
We should not listen
to this man.

353
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,967
He is ruining America
for everybody.

354
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:10,811
Tell me again. I've been called away
from the most important case
of my career because-

355
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:14,818
- 'Cause Mr. Monk said he saw a body.
- From up there? From the third floor?

356
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,116
While he was deliberating
on another case?

357
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,714
<i>Captain!</i>

358
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,658
We got a body.

359
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:34,096
Rope everything off. That side too.
Yes, sir.

360
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,163
Natalie, don't touch anything.

361
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:42,004
<i>Well, he was right about the body.</i>

362
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,880
People, whatever happened
down there has nothing
to do with us.

363
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:49,409
- We still have a job to do.
- Maybe we should take another vote.

364
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,889
Good idea. Let's just see
who stands where, all right?

365
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,892
Everybody back.

366
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,724
Now, just by a show of hands,

367
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,822
- who's still voting guilty?
- Guilty.

368
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:05,728
Not guilty?

369
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:11,408
- Six to six.
- And we go into extra innings.

370
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:18,176
<i>Mr. Monk, it's a woman!</i>
<i>She's... about 60 years old.</i>

371
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,377
Who is she?

372
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,443
No I.D.
No I.D.!

373
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,786
- No idea?
- No I.D.!

374
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,882
No idea.

375
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,893
No I.D.!

376
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:33,089
No idea?

377
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:36,327
No... "I"...

378
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,531
- "D"!
- No idea.

379
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,539
No-

380
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,666
Here, here.

381
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,105
"I"...

382
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,977
"D"!

383
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,757
No idea?

384
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:03,293
No I.D.!
No I.D.!

385
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,989
No idea? Check her identification.

386
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,734
No I.D.!
No I.D.!

387
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,793
- Are those orthopedic shoes?
- What?

388
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:15,601
Those shoes- orthopedic shoes?

389
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:19,167
Yeah, I think so!

390
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,269
I remember-

391
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:24,440
<i>I saw her in the waiting room!</i>

392
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,279
- I think she's a juror!
- What?

393
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,683
- Juror. A juror!
- What?

394
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,654
What the hell is that?
Looks like one of your jurors...

395
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,521
leaning out of a window
talking to a police officer.

396
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,993
I want that jury sequestered
as of now!

397
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,511
What are you doing?

398
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,041
You were smoking.

399
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:36,849
I'm allowed to smoke.
Read the sign.

400
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:38,855
It's keeping me awake.

401
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:41,153
And you're gonna start a fire.

402
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,558
Then there's no problem.
You're awake. Right?

403
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:46,222
If there's a fire,

404
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,492
you'll see it,
and you'll put it out, right?

405
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,769
- Hey, right?
- Right.

406
00:27:56,741 --> 00:28:01,405
Ah, don't be such an ass
in the jury room.

407
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:10,619
- Good night.
Good night.

408
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:53,527
I'd like to confirm a reservation
for tomorrow afternoon.

409
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:58,865
My reservation number
is X-7-3-2-9-4.

410
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,872
Yes. Flight 32 to Bogotá.

411
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,101
The two of us- me and my husband.

412
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,540
4:30?

413
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,944
Don't worry. We won't be late.

414
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:17,880
Lieutenant, my nose itches.

415
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:20,823
Forget it.
Ah, it doesn't matter.

416
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,292
I'll scratch it myself
soon enough.

417
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:30,295
Captain, he just said
he was gonna scratch his nose.

418
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,503
Okay.

419
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,563
Well, the way he said it-
It was like a threat.

420
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,308
He threatened
to scratch his nose?

421
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,974
Lieutenant, bring the van around.
Let's get this over with.

422
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,754
Not guilty?

423
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:55,156
- It's still eight to four.
- Is that clock right?

424
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:58,195
<i>Number 11, you've made</i>
<i>some really good points.</i>

425
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:00,424
I admit that.
But everything you said...

426
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:04,093
about the timeline,
the location of the wound-
It's all circumstantial.

427
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:06,330
Exactly. What he's doing
is he's taking the facts...

428
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,395
and he's twisting it around
like a pretzel.

429
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:12,671
- Now, where's the proof, man?
- We don't need any proof.
All we need is a reasonable doubt.

430
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,178
You know what I say?
I say we're at a deadlock, and I say...

431
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:17,840
<i>we go back in there right now</i>
<i>and tell 'em we got a hung jury.</i>

432
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:21,352
- What is he doing?
- I'm afraid to ask.

433
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:25,879
Excuse me.
Karl Palmer testified
that after he was stabbed,

434
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:30,223
he grabbed this towel
off the floor of his car,

435
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:33,526
- and he pressed it against his leg.
- So?

436
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,533
Now, look at the stains.

437
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,195
They're symmetrical.

438
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:43,366
I don't think he just grabbed
the towel.

439
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:47,241
I think he folded it...

440
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,371
very carefully-

441
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:53,281
before he used it.

442
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,546
<i>You know- You know, so what?</i>

443
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,554
The guy was a neatnik.

444
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:59,590
He was in pain.
He'd just been stabbed.

445
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:02,592
Nobody would stop
and fold the towel.
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

446
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,221
He folded the towel
before he stabbed himself.

447
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:09,198
It was definitely self-inflicted.
I'm convinced.

448
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,735
Me too. Not guilty.

449
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,704
- Thank you.
- What about you?

450
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,118
Not guilty.

451
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,746
I'd like another vote.

452
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,791
Absolutely.
All of those voting not guilty.

453
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,951
I-I'm switching my vote to guilty.

454
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,658
- <i>What?</i>
- What about the towel?

455
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,963
It means nothing to me.
The vote's 11 to one.

456
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,299
- Wow.
- Where are you going?

457
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:49,568
<i>To the bathroom.</i>
<i>You got a problem with that?</i>

458
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,740
Can you believe that?

459
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,983
No. I can't.

460
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:09,286
- You're a science teacher, right?
- Mm-hmm.

461
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,487
<i>Is this what I think it is?</i>

462
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:21,002
It's lime.
That's what I thought.

463
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:25,907
I think Number 12
murdered that woman
in the Dumpster.

464
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:31,113
- Why?
- <i>She needed to get on a jury.</i>

465
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:34,117
<i>I remember her talking</i>
<i>to a woman in the assembly room.</i>

466
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,915
<i>I think she was looking</i>
<i>for someone who lived alone,</i>

467
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,616
<i>with no family,</i>
<i>who wouldn't be missed.</i>

468
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:43,218
Killing somebody to get on a jury?
That's a first.

469
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,489
She's been looking
at that clock all day.
<i>That's right.</i>

470
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:50,660
She's- She's waiting for... something.
She's- She's stalling us.

471
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:54,728
She doesn't care
what the verdict is.

472
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,070
Look.

473
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,668
Whatever way we vote,
she'll vote the opposite.

474
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:04,146
But in the first ballot,
she voted with us.

475
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,183
<i>But she was sitting next to me.</i>

476
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,708
<i>She must have seen</i>
<i>how I was voting</i>
<i>and went the other way.</i>

477
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:13,188
- I don't believe it.
- I can prove it- I think.

478
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:16,522
But I'm gonna need your help.
No. Wait a minute. We can't just-

479
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:21,054
Yesterday you said
we were partners.

480
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,066
I can't do this alone.

481
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,901
<i>What'd I miss?</i>

482
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:35,070
<i>Oh, we were just talking, and-</i>

483
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:38,377
Well, we've thought about it,

484
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:41,577
and we've decided that...
you're right.

485
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:44,416
<i>He's guilty.</i>

486
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,891
- Really?
- Yeah. We're all changing
our vote.

487
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,895
In fact, let's make it official.
Right.

488
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:54,261
Who's voting guilty?

489
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,893
I'm undecided. I-

490
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,370
- Just give me a few minutes.
- What are you up to?

491
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,703
I have every right to change my mind.

492
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,743
I think it's time
to call the bailiff.

493
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,641
Have a seat, Number 11.

494
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,680
We're still deliberating.

495
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:37,240
<i>There we go.</i>

496
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,708
<i>Number 11, I have to thank you.</i>

497
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:44,737
I had to keep everybody here
in this room, busy, arguing
for a day and a half.

498
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,546
I wasn't sure
how I was gonna do it,
but you made it easy.

499
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:50,109
<i>Don't mention it.</i>
Why are you doing this?

500
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,452
She's helping her boyfriend escape.

501
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:55,686
<i>She had to have a way</i>
<i>to get into this building.</i>

502
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,456
How about a little privacy, huh?

503
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,259
It's not even. It's not even-
Shut up.

504
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:04,790
Not even.
I've been waiting
a long time to do this.

505
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,429
It's not even-

506
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,088
Thanks.

507
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,998
Listen. Did you check upstairs?
There's a drop ceiling-

508
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:45,406
Whatever it is, Captain,
we got it covered.

509
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,467
Okay.

510
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,822
- What's that?
- It's your receipt.
Why don't you keep it...

511
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,882
as a souvenir.

512
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,700
What's going on?

513
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,985
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-huh.

514
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:49,096
Thank you. Thank you.

515
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,929
No! No!

516
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:16,021
<i>Mr. Monk? Are you okay?</i>

517
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,992
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

518
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,902
Mr. Monk, what happened? Here.

519
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,906
God.

520
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,638
Oh, God.

521
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,839
Wait. Wait, wait.

522
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,016
Aah!
What? What?

523
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:43,417
I was saying, "For the love of God,
please don't rip off the tape!"

524
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,512
Are you guys okay?

525
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:47,682
Mm-hmm.
Is everyone all right?

526
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:08,371
You did it, <i>preciosa</i>.

527
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:17,546
Hey.
Disher.

528
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:20,613
Give me a pack of Juicy Fruit.
Shots fired, third floor.

529
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:30,400
Oh, my God!
- We need paramedics on three.

530
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:33,960
We're in the north wing.
We have two agents down.
But they're gonna be okay.

531
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,235
They were both wearing vests.

532
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:43,140
They went up.
Why would they go upstairs?

533
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,315
Can I use that phone?

534
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:53,619
Well, he didn't come through here.
Get somebody in the basement.
Get somebody in the basement.

535
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,625
<i>Look down the parking garage.</i>
Disher!

536
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:58,924
<i>Calmly! Calmly! Slowly! Slowly!</i>
Captain! Captain!

537
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,930
It's Monk.
Monk?

538
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:03,159
Right here. This way.
Slowly. Calm.

539
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,930
Outside.
<i>Look out! Look out!</i>

540
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,779
Hello, Miguel.

541
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,407
And you must be the fiancée.

542
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,417
Aren't you supposed
to be upstairs?

543
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,948
Some people will do anything
to get out of jury duty.

544
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:27,616
<i>Step down, please.</i>

545
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,761
Come on.

546
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:40,401
And this is Number Six.
She didn't say much,

547
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,530
but she was a very important
part of the team.

548
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,507
Stay cool.
I will.

549
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:48,044
I'll stay cool. Yeah.
Yeah?

550
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,513
Yeah. Yeah.
Part of the team, huh?
Good for you.

551
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:54,380
Yeah. And this is Number Two.
Natalie.

552
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,579
Hello.
You should listen to this man.

553
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,781
He is good for America.

554
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:03,350
And this is Number Seven.
We were kind of co-captains, really.
I mean-

555
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,554
Sort of... thing-

556
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,029
And... that's Number Four.

557
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:10,999
He sort of hated my guts
in the beginning.
You can admit it now.

558
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:15,835
I'll see you at the reunion. Okay?
One year from today, Benihana's.

559
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,567
You know,
that's not gonna happen.

560
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,241
Think I'll stay
and straighten up.

561
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,343
No.

562
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,919
<i>Are we going?</i>
Yeah.
