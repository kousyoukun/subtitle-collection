So does the prosecution, and so do I.

- Oh, no. I wasn't called.

Your Honor,

00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,999
I will not be able

<i>for a number of reasons.</i>

First off, uh-
<i>[Man Coughs, Sniffles]</i>

163
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,671
There's the bathroom situation.

164
00:08:48,747 --> 00:08:51,910
I can't <i>share</i> a bathroom.

165

<i>I just can't.</i>
<i>You can ask Natalie.</i>

Natalie?
Yeah. He's persnickety. He's very persnickety.

167
00:08:57,956 --> 00:09:00,322
He's persnickety squared.

168
00:09:00,392 --> 00:09:04,692
And I have special
dietary needs, Your Honor.

169
00:09:04,763 --> 00:09:10,497
I can't eat food unless
I actually... see it being prepared.

170
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:12,594
That's true, Your Honor.

- Anything else?
- Yes, sir.

172
00:09:22,114 --> 00:09:27,984
I have... two plants at home
that are completely dependent on me, Your Honor.

173
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:30,487
Plants?

174
00:09:30,556 --> 00:09:35,550
I have a fern.
A small azalea bush.

175
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:39,063
And you have an assistant.
Can't she water the plants?

176
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:41,656
Good question.
Here's the thing.

177
00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:45,260
She has a tendency to overwater.
Okay, that's not true. That happened once.

178
00:09:45,337 --> 00:09:47,305
More than once.
It was two ounces.

179
00:09:47,372 --> 00:09:49,602
Two ounces to an azalea bush
is like a swimming pool-

- Objection.
- You areJuror Number 11.

It's okay, Mr. Palmer.
Take your time.

What did you do then?

194
00:10:38,527 --> 00:10:42,520
I was bleeding pretty bad,
so I grabbed an old towel out of my car-

195
00:10:42,597 --> 00:10:46,089
There was one on the floor-
and I pressed it against the wound.

It's hers, Your Honor. Number Three.

<i>That'll do, Mr. Monk.</i>

Proceed, Mr. Fox.

204
00:11:11,927 --> 00:11:15,886

and took off.

Oh, my God! - We need paramedics on three.

602
00:39:33,161 --> 00:39:36,653
We're in the north wing.
We have two agents down. But they're gonna be okay.

603
00:39:36,731 --> 00:39:39,928
They were both wearing vests.

604
00:39:41,169 --> 00:39:45,833
They went up.
Why would they go upstairs?

605
00:39:48,743 --> 00:39:52,008
Can I use that phone?
[Man Groans]

606
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,312
Well, he didn't come through here.
Get somebody in the basement. Get somebody in the basement.

607
00:39:56,384 --> 00:39:58,318
<i>Look down the parking garage.</i>
Disher!

608
00:39:58,386 --> 00:40:01,617
<i>Calmly.! Calmly.! Slowly.! Slowly.!</i>
Captain! Captain!

609
00:40:01,689 --> 00:40:03,623
It's Monk.
Monk?

610
00:40:03,691 --> 00:40:05,852
Right here. This way.
Slowly. Calm.

611
00:40:05,927 --> 00:40:08,623
Outside.
<i>[Man]</i> <i>Look out.! Look out.!</i>

612
00:40:17,004 --> 00:40:19,472
Hello, Miguel.

613
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,100
And you must be the fiancée.

614
00:40:22,176 --> 00:40:24,110
Aren't you supposed
to be upstairs?

615
00:40:25,446 --> 00:40:27,641
Some people will do anything
to get out of jury duty.

616
00:40:27,715 --> 00:40:30,309
<i>Step down, please.</i>

617
00:40:33,054 --> 00:40:35,454
Come on.

618
00:40:40,728 --> 00:40:43,094
And this is Number Six.
She didn't say much,

619
00:40:43,164 --> 00:40:45,223
but she was a very important
part of the team.

620
00:40:45,299 --> 00:40:48,200
Stay cool.
I will.

621
00:40:48,269 --> 00:40:50,737
I'll stay cool. Yeah.
Yeah?

622
00:40:50,805 --> 00:40:54,206
Yeah. Yeah.
Part of the team, huh? Good for you.

623
00:40:54,275 --> 00:40:57,073
Yeah. And this is Number Two.
Natalie.

624
00:40:57,145 --> 00:40:59,272
Hello.
You should listen to this man.

625
00:40:59,347 --> 00:41:01,474
He is good for America.
[Chuckles]

626
00:41:01,549 --> 00:41:06,043
And this is Number Seven.
We were kind of co-captains, really. I mean-

627
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,247
Sort of... thing-

628
00:41:08,322 --> 00:41:10,722
And... that's Number Four.

629
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:13,692
He sort of hated my guts
in the beginning. You can admit it now.

630
00:41:13,761 --> 00:41:18,528
I'll see you at the reunion. Okay?
One year from today, Benihana's.

631
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,260
You know,
that's not gonna happen.

632
00:41:22,336 --> 00:41:24,327
[Chuckles]

633
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:29,934
Think I'll stay
and straighten up.

634
00:41:30,011 --> 00:41:32,036
No.

635
00:41:34,382 --> 00:41:36,612
<i>Are we going?</i>
Yeah.

636
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:41,212
