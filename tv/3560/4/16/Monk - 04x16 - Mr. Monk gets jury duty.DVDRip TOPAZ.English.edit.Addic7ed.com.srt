Well, you're going to have
to find someone else to run it.

- Oh, no. I wasn't called.

Your Honor,

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,013
I will not be able

<i>for a number of reasons.</i>

First off, uh...
<i>[Man Coughs, Sniffles]</i>

163
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:48,685
There's the bathroom situation.

164
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,924
I can't <i>share</i> a bathroom.

165
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,966
<i>I just can't.</i>
<i>You can ask Natalie.</i>

Natalie?
Yeah. He's persnickety.
He's very persnickety.

167
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,336
He's persnickety squared.

168
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:04,706
And I have special
dietary needs, Your Honor.

169
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:10,511
I can't eat food unless
I actually... see it being prepared.

170
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,608
That's true, Your Honor.

- Anything else?
- Yes, sir.

172
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:27,998
I have... two plants at home
that are completely dependent
on me, Your Honor.

173
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,501
Plants?

174
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,564
I have a fern.
A small azalea bush.

175
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:39,077
And you have an assistant.
Can't she water the plants?

176
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,670
Good question.
Here's the thing.

177
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,274
She has a tendency to overwater.
Okay, that's not true.
That happened once.

178
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,319
More than once.
It was two ounces.

179
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,616
Two ounces to an azalea bush
is like a swimming pool...

- Objection.
- You areJuror Number 11.

It's okay, Mr. Palmer.
Take your time.

What did you do then?

194
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,630
I was bleeding pretty bad,
so I grabbed an old towel
out of my car...

195
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:45,199
There was one on the floor...
and I pressed it against the wound.

Proceed, Mr. Fox.

204
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,996

and took off.

[Groans]
Hey.
Disher.

599
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:20,613
Give me a pack ofJuicy Fruit.
Shots fired, third floor.

600
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:25,284
[Panting]

601
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:30,400
- [Natalie]
Oh, my God!
- We need paramedics on three.

602
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:33,960
We're in the north wing.
We have two agents down.
But they're gonna be okay.

603
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,235
They were both wearing vests.

604
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:43,140
They went up.
Why would they go upstairs?

605
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,315
Can I use that phone?
[Man Groans]

606
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:53,619
Well, he didn't come through here.
Get somebody in the basement.
Get somebody in the basement.

607
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,625
<i>Look down the parking garage.</i>
Disher!

608
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:58,924
<i>Calmly! Calmly! Slowly! Slowly!</i>
Captain! Captain!

609
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,930
It's Monk.
Monk?

610
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:03,159
Right here. This way.
Slowly. Calm.

611
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,930
Outside.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Look out! Look out!</i>

612
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,779
Hello, Miguel.

613
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,407
And you must be the fiancée.

614
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,417
Aren't you supposed
to be upstairs?

615
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,948
Some people will do anything
to get out of jury duty.

616
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:27,616
<i>Step down, please.</i>

617
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,761
Come on.

618
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:40,401
And this is Number Six.
She didn't say much,

619
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,530
but she was a very important
part of the team.

620
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,507
Stay cool.
I will.

621
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:48,044
I'll stay cool. Yeah.
Yeah?

622
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,513
Yeah. Yeah.
Part of the team, huh?
Good for you.

623
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:54,380
Yeah. And this is Number Two.
Natalie.

624
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,579
Hello.
You should listen to this man.

625
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,781
He is good for America.
[Chuckles]

626
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:03,350
And this is Number Seven.
We were kind of co-captains, really.
I mean...

627
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,554
Sort of... thing...

628
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,029
And... that's Number Four.

629
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:10,999
He sort of hated my guts
in the beginning.
You can admit it now.

630
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:15,835
I'll see you at the reunion. Okay?
One year from today, Benihana's.

631
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,567
You know,
that's not gonna happen.

632
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,634
[Chuckles]

633
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,241
Think I'll stay
and straighten up.

634
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,343
No.

635
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,919
<i>Are we going?</i>
Yeah.
