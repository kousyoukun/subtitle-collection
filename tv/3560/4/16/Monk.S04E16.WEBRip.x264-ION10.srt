I think it's purplish.

Oh, I'm having fun.

I love this stuff.
Yeah, so I see.

59
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,644
You know, I usually
don't like shaking hands,

60
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,514
but I ever met the man
who invented Tupperware,

61
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,882
I would shake his hand.

62
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,784
I think he might be dead.

63
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:31,752
Well, I would
still shake his hand,

64
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,688
because he's probably
perfectly preserved.

Uh-oh what?

Mr. Monk, you're not
gonna get picked.

You're

on the force.

I can't believe they're still
renovating this place.

I'm so proud of you.

I'm gonna get picked.

101
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,793
Mr. Monk, you're gonna have
to take off your belt.

102
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,395
Ah, I was going to anyway.

103
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:24,832
To hang myself.

104
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:28,302
Don't get me wrong,
it's a great system.

105
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:30,538
It really is the best
justice system in the world.

106
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:31,705
I agree.

107
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,907
I just don't wanna
be a part of it.

108
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,877
Mr. Monk, what if everybody
felt that way?

109
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,012
Everybody does.

110
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,697
Mr. Monk, I don't understand.

111
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,899
You dedicated your life
to fighting crimes, right?

112
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,334
Solving mysteries.

113
00:05:00,368 --> 00:05:02,570
Sending guilty people
to jail?

114
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:03,837
Well, you can do that here.

115
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,706
That's what juries do.
It's the same thing.

116
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,742
But I work alone.
I'm a lone wolf.

117
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:09,743
You're a lone wolf?

118
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:11,679
Even when I was
on the force,

119
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,847
I didn't really like
having a partner.

120
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:15,549
I can't work with
other people.

121
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,818
Okay, well, I think
that's kind of sad.

122
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:21,355
I agree.
It's very sad.

123
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:22,890
You know, I hope you do
get picked.

124
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:23,824
I think it'd be
good for you.

125
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:24,858
Don't say that.

126
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:27,528
You know, you work with
different kinds of people.

127
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:28,896
You know, you listen
to their opinions.

128
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,532
Argue, compromise.

Do you think
he'll try again?

00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,062
We're taking every precaution
to avoid that.

145
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,465
Isn't that what they said
last time?

146
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:05,933
I wasn't in charge
last time.

147
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,735
Well, what are you doing
to ensure--

148
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:09,870
(jury clerk)
Hello!

00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,005
Did everybody sign in?

150
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,508
If I call your name,
you are required to come back

151
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:20,948
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.
and report to room 302.

your name...

Yes!

00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,474
Is this a bad time?

159
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:49,943
Yeah, it is now.

00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:52,580

Special Agent Lapides.

162
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:55,282
Actually, I'm not alone.

163
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,249
I'm here with
the Attorney General.

00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,955
He's in here.
You wanna read it?

166
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:03,824
I don't need
to read it.

167
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,959
I'm not giving you Escobar.
No way.

168
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:07,027
No how.

169
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,663
Leland, this case is bigger
than San Francisco.

170
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:11,031
Escobar was supplying drugs
to seven states.

171
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,099
Yeah, but we caught him here.

172
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:13,100
You're damn right we did,

173
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,602
and we got him
on homicide.

174
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,136
Right here in the
city of San Francisco.

175
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,038
This case represents
three years of my life.

176
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,873
Well, you have the thanks
of a grateful nation.

177
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,141
But it's a done deal.

178
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,843
A Federal indictment's
already been filed.

179
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,778
We're gonna try him first.

180
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,013
Sons of bitches.

181
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,215
There's an extradition hearing
on Thursday.

182
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,883
Here's how
it's gonna work.

183
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:30,951
You baby-sit Escobar
until then.

184
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,520
You bring him
to the courthouse.

185
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:33,554
We meet you in the lobby.

186
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:34,955
You drop him off.
You go home.

187
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,860
What's that, sir?

188
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:40,928
Yeah.
I'll tell him.

189
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,497
The Attorney General says,

190
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:45,966
"Don't screw it up."

191
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,841
Mr. Daughtry,
it says here

192
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:56,877
that you've been excused
from jury duty

193
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,579
three times before?

194
00:07:58,612 --> 00:07:59,847
I got a business to run.

195
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,682
Well, you're gonna have to
find someone else

196
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:02,950
to run it.

197
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,952
The defense accepts you,
so does the prosecution.

198
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,219
So do I.

199
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:09,189
Have a seat,
you're juror number 10.

200
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,092
Okay, next.
Stand up.

201
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,260
(court clerk)
State your name.

202
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,528
Uh, Natalie Teeger.

203
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:15,563
Spell it.

204
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,898
Oh, no, I wasn't called.

205
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,700
She's my assistant,
Your Honor.

206
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,101
And you are...

207
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,303
Adrian Monk.

208
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,939
Capital A.
Small D, small R.

209
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:28,141
Small I, small A,
small N. Space.

210
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,744
Thank you, Mr. Monk.
I think we have it.

211
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,281
Your Honor...

212
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:37,217
I will not be able
to serve today.

213
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,587
Unfortunately.

214
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,854
For a number of reasons.

215
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,556
First off...

216
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,157
[blows nose]

217
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:48,629
There's the
bathroom situation.

218
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,832
I can't share
a bathroom.

219
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,867
I just can't.

220
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:54,902
You can ask Natalie.
Natalie?

221
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,771
Yeah, he's persnickety.
He's very persnickety.

222
00:08:57,805 --> 00:09:00,073
He's persnickety squared.

223
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:04,812
And I have special
dietary needs, Your Honor.

224
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:09,082
I can't eat food
unless I actually see it

225
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:10,818
being prepared.

226
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:13,587
That's true, Your Honor.

227
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:14,822
Anything else?

228
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:17,290
Yes, sir.

229
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,932
I have two plants at home

230
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,868
that are completely
dependent on me, Your Honor.

231
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,169
Plants.

232
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:32,272
I have a fern.

233
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,208
And a small azalea bush.

234
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,143
And you have an assistant.

235
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,912
Can't she water
the plants?

236
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:41,849
Good question,
here's the thing.

237
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,717
She has a tendency
to overwater.

238
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:44,918
Okay, that is not true.

239
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:47,387
That happened once.
It was two ounces.

240
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,256
Two ounces to
an azalea bush is like

241
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,257
a swimming pool,
Your Honor.

242
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,259
Mr. Monk, I have seen

243
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,261
hundreds of people
pretend to be disturbed

244
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,696
to avoid jury duty,

245
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,731
but you, sir, are in a class
by yourself.

246
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,733
Thank you, Your Honor.

247
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:00,768
Well, it's not
gonna work, sir.

248
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:03,904
You have a seat, Mr. Monk.

249
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,739
Objection.

250
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,675
You are juror number 11.

251
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,783
It's okay, Mr. Palmer.
Take your time.

252
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:18,285
Could you show us exactly
where you were stabbed?

253
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,159
Right here.

254
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:27,661
In the thigh.

255
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:29,096
Mr. Monk...

256
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,130
you have to look!

257
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,199
(Judge Rienzo)
Number 11.

258
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,702
Evidence is presented, sir,
for you.

259
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,238
(prosecutor Fox)
What did you do then?

260
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:41,008
I was bleeding pretty bad.

261
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,976
So I grabbed an old towel
out of my car.

262
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,912
There was one
on the floor.

263
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:47,080
And I pressed it
against the wound.

264
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:48,081
[cell phone ringing]

265
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:49,082
Whose phone was that?

266
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:51,284
It's hers, Your Honor.

267
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,419
Number 3.

268
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,256
And she fell asleep.

269
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,025
The old number 8.

270
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:00,360
Nobody likes a tattletale,
Mr. Monk.

271
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,362
I think number 9
is a tattletale.

272
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,431
That'll do, Mr. Monk.

273
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:06,867
Proceed...

274
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,435
Mr. Fox.

275
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:12,039
What happened
after you were stabbed?

276
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,007
He grabbed my deposit envelope

277
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,809
and took off.

278
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,111
Carl, is the person
that stabbed you

279
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:19,880
at that rest stop,
took your money

280
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,949
and ran away,
in this courtroom today?

281
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:24,451
Yes, sir.
He's right there.

282
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,287
[sneezes violently]

283
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,789
[sneezes]

284
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,127
What are you doing?

285
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,729
He needs a wipe,
Your Honor.

286
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:37,364
Sit down, Miss Teeger.

287
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:38,999
Sit down!

288
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,401
If you interfere
with the jury again,

289
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,436
I will have you arrested
for tampering

290
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,938
and contempt.
Understand?

291
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,740
Yes, Sir. Sorry.
[clears throat]

292
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:49,977
Let the record show
that the witness

293
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,045
has identified
the defendant

294
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,713
Robert Perry.

295
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:05,392
Oh, my God.

296
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,762
No cell phones
are allowed.

297
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,931
You'll get 'em back
when you're done.

298
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,132
I'll be down the hallway
if you need me.

299
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,534
Just ring the buzzer.

300
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,070
Thank you.
Thank you.

301
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,338
Thank you.
Okay.

302
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,007
What did you think?

303
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,809
I thought it was
pretty interesting.

304
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:22,910
Very interesting.

305
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,778
I filled up
three notebooks.

306
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:42,262
What are you doing?

307
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,965
I'm just
making them even.

308
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,868
So we can all concentrate.

309
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:50,437
And not be distracted.

310
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,105
By uneven Venetian blinds.

311
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,475
Okay, everyone,
let's get started.

312
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,145
I've done this before,
so, uh, I would be glad

313
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,980
to be our foreman
if there are no objections.

314
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,281
No.
No.

315
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,516
All right, great, well,
let's all have a seat.

316
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,921
Actually, it'd be best
if we all sat in order.

317
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,556
If you don't mind,
I'm juror number 7

318
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,960
and...we'll go this way.
Number 8...

319
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,262
And so forth.
Okay, great.

320
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,498
You look happy.

321
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,034
This is very exciting
for me.

322
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:22,102
I feel like
a real American.

323
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,437
Excuse me?
Yeah?

324
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,173
Do you mind if we
traded seats?

325
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:27,374
Why?

326
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:30,911
I'd rather be number 10.
My favorite number.

327
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,479
It's kind of important.

328
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,481
Look, the guy is trying
to change seats.

329
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:35,949
You know what, pal?

330
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:36,984
Nobody's trading anything
with you.

331
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:37,985
Now sit down, okay?

332
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:41,488
I mean it.
Sit, okay?

333
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:46,960
So I've been on
a few juries.

334
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,161
And it's customary
to start off

335
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,931
with a preliminary vote
by secret ballot.

336
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:52,866
Just to see
where we all are.

337
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,201
Any objections?

338
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:56,036
None.

339
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,104
Great.

340
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,647
Anybody mind if I, uh, smoke?

341
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,050
[all minding]

342
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,051
All right, all right,
all right.

343
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:14,154
I'm not the one on trial.
Okay, folks, huh?

344
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,889
Just pass 'em down, please.

345
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:18,591
All right, well,
let's do this.

346
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,128
Guilty.

347
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:24,131
Guilty.

348
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:25,232
Guilty.

349
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:29,002
Guilty.

350
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,371
Guilty.

351
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:34,274
Guilty.

352
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,343
Guilty.

353
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,211
Guilty.

354
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:40,680
Guilty.

355
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:45,085
Guilty.

356
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,020
Guilty.

357
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,556
Wow, that was easy.

358
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,058
Guess I'll be home
for dinner.

359
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:53,326
Wait a minute,
that was only 11.

360
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,095
Who didn't vote?

361
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:06,106
Smudge.

362
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:09,042
You gotta be kidding.

363
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,011
Thank you.

364
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:20,013
It's no problem.

365
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:23,616
Not guilty.

366
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,019
[all griping and groaning]

367
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,387
That makes it 11 to 1.

368
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,156
You know, there's always one,
isn't there?

369
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:29,956
There's always one.

370
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,591
Do you really think
he's not guilty?

371
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,560
I don't know.

372
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,195
Of course he's guilty.

373
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:38,165
Look at the evidence.
They found the knife.

374
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,767
The knife he used.
In his knapsack.

375
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,669
Plus, the victim
identified him.

376
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:43,670
I mean, what more
do you want?

377
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:46,573
I don't know,
I have a feeling

378
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:49,809
there's more to it.
It's a feeling.

379
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,479
I would just like to
think about it for a while.

380
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:56,549
[all grumbling and arguing]

381
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:00,587
I'm gonna need you all
to be quiet.

382
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,722
[all grumbling]

383
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,058
To concentrate.
Shhh.

384
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:06,259
I'm gonna
walk around now.

385
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:08,295
And pace back and forth.

386
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,063
Then, when I'm ready,
I'll tell you the solution.

387
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:11,564
That's how it works.

388
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,769
No.
No way.

389
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,738
You're not alone here.

390
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,474
You have to
talk to us.

391
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:22,675
Tell us what
you're thinking.

392
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,511
That's not how I do it.

393
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,314
I have a system.
It's a gift and a curse.

394
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:28,415
Here's the thing,

395
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,583
I don't like working
with partners.

396
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,586
Well, like it or not,
you've got 11 partners now.

397
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,627
Pay attention, I'm only
gonna say this once.

398
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,396
Escobar's hearing
is tomorrow at 12:00 noon.

399
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,333
We lock this joint down
tonight at midnight.

400
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,501
Every exit,
every window.

401
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:51,171
1:00 a.m.,
we sweep for bombs.

402
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:52,272
Head to toe.

403
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,541
6:00 AM, I want snipers
on this roof

404
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,876
and on the roof next door.

405
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,179
We arrive at 11:30.

406
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:01,648
11:40, we meet Lapides
at the elevator

407
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,150
and hand him off.

408
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:06,253
After that,
he's the Bureau's headache.

409
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,887
Sir, could you
repeat that, please?

410
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,322
Yeah, what part?

411
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:10,757
Uh, everything after
"Pay attention,

412
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,161
I'm only gonna
say this once."

413
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,471
[knocking on door]

414
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,907
Exhibit 15B.

415
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,142
Thank you.

416
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:30,477
What's he doing now?

417
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,346
We're not sure.

418
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,448
Did you talk
to the judge?

419
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:36,549
(Bailiff)
He says it's too late.

420
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,886
He's already sent
the alternates home.

421
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,355
You're stuck with him.
[chuckles]

422
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:52,899
[sneezes]

423
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,334
[sneezes]

424
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,736
Bless you.
Thank you.

425
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:08,215
Excuse me.

426
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,616
Would you mind
trying these on?

427
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,184
What for?

428
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:13,820
You're about the same height
as the victim,

429
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:16,323
and I just wanna
try something.

430
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,957
It'll just
take a minute.

431
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,326
What do we got,
a fashion show?

432
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,794
You believe this guy?

433
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:24,397
We know that these
are the pants...

434
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:28,768
that the victim was wearing
when he was attacked.

435
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:32,472
Could you step up,
please?

436
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,474
Of course, you can see
where the knife

437
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,909
went through the fabric.

438
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,044
Well, something
doesn't add up.

439
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:42,949
I noticed Mr. Palmer likes
to wear his pants low.

440
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:46,786
In the courtroom, we could
almost see his...

441
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,655
bottom part.

442
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,989
Rear posterior.
Side...

443
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:50,990
His butt?

444
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,992
Thank you.

445
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,895
Look at the wound.

446
00:19:55,928 --> 00:20:02,235
He was actually stabbed
in the upper thigh.

447
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,538
It doesn't match up.

448
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,240
He's right,
look at that.

449
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:09,576
At least,
not when he's standing.

450
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:10,943
Could you
have a seat, please?

451
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:17,950
Son of a bitch.

452
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:19,686
He was sitting down.

453
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,887
What does that prove?

454
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,755
Mr. Palmer said he was
standing up

455
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:23,756
when he was stabbed.

456
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,925
He was lying.

457
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,594
I think he pulled
into that rest stop,

458
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:30,897
saw Robert Perry,
who was sleeping.

459
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,966
Stabbed himself,
pocketed the money,

460
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,269
and then blamed everything
on Perry.

461
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:43,943
I'm switching my vote...
to Not Guilty.

462
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:48,247
[all expressing disbelief]

463
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:51,818
(Patel)
We should listen
to this man.

464
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:52,952
He was a very brave man

465
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,454
to stand up
against us all.

466
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,290
[dog barking]

467
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,328
(postal worker)
What about
the DNA evidence?

468
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:04,030
You can't just
ignore that.

469
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:05,932
They found the victim's blood
on Perry's knife.

470
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,467
How do we know it was
Robert Perry's knife?

471
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,001
He denied ever seeing it.

472
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:10,069
Of course he denied it.

473
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,504
What the hell
do you expect?

474
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:12,639
Well, his prints
weren't on it.

475
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:15,041
Well, then,
he wiped them off, huh?

476
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,009
Look, it was
in his knapsack!

477
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,346
What the hell kind
of a detective are you?

478
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,548
I'm the kind of detective
who wonders

479
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:23,316
why someone would
take the time

480
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,619
to wipe down the handle,
but not the blade.

481
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,388
[groans]

482
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:36,363
Also, the timeline
is all wrong.

483
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:39,466
Robert Perry was picked up
an hour after the assault.

484
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:42,001
Less than two miles
from there.

485
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,670
So what?

486
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:44,904
He wasn't running away.

487
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:47,340
If I had
just stabbed somebody--

488
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:49,676
Somebody moved that tarp.

489
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:50,843
Excuse me?

490
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:55,682
There's a dumpster down there
with a tarp in it.

491
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:57,650
Yesterday the tarp
was rolled up

492
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:58,918
and draped over the side.

493
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,987
What does this
have to do with us?

494
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,988
Or this case?

495
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:03,990
Or anything?

496
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:05,458
I'm sorry,
you're right.

497
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:06,659
You're right.
Okay, what's next?

498
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,027
The money.
Okay, the money.

499
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,796
What happened
to the money?

500
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:10,797
Maybe he buried it.

501
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,832
Lime.

502
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:17,069
Somebody poured lime
all over that tarp.

503
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,839
I think there's
a body down there.

504
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,874
Oh, we're never
getting out of here.

505
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,410
[buzzer]

506
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:27,880
Hello, I'm number 11.

507
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:28,881
Yeah, I remember.

508
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:29,982
I know
this sounds crazy,

509
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,018
but there's
a dumpster downstairs.

510
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,954
I saw a police dog
sniffing around.

511
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:39,859
I think there's a body
under that blue tarp.

512
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:42,695
(bailiff)
Judge Rienzo said
I should keep an eye on you.

513
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:45,965
He said to report you
if you cause any delay

514
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:46,999
or disruption.

515
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,501
Is that what
you're doing?

516
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,070
No.

517
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,005
No, no.
No.

518
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,041
No.

519
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:04,984
Natalie!

520
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,419
Natalie!

521
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,892
Mr. Monk,
I brought your dinner!

522
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:14,994
I'm gonna leave it
downstairs!

523
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:15,995
The dumpster!

524
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:16,996
What?

525
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,466
The dumpster!

526
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:20,500
It's Natalie.

527
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,938
There's a body
in the dumpster!

528
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:29,175
You want a hot toddy
and Munster?

529
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:30,943
I brought a Cobb salad!

530
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:33,145
There's a body
in the dumpster!

531
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,081
I just got
the Cobb salad!

532
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:36,683
What are you
talking about?

533
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:37,884
What are you
talking about?

534
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,886
There is a...

535
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,556
dead....

536
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,759
body in the dumpster.

537
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:50,597
Call Captain Stottlemeyer!

538
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,764
Okay, wait, a body?

539
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,033
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

540
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:57,169
We should not
listen to this man.

541
00:23:57,203 --> 00:24:01,073
He is ruining America
for everybody.

542
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,647
Tell me again.

543
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,617
I've been called away
from the most important case

544
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,884
of my career because...

545
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:13,553
Because Mr. Monk
said he saw a body.

546
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:15,588
From up there.
From the third floor.

547
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,890
While he was deliberating
on another case.

548
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:20,527
(Disher)
Captain!

549
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,928
We got a body.

550
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:36,042
Rope everything off.
That side too.

551
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:38,044
Natalie,
don't touch anything.

552
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:43,950
Well, he was right
about the body.

553
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,152
People, whatever happened
down there

554
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:47,920
has nothing to do
with us.

555
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:48,921
We still have
a job to do.

556
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:50,923
Maybe we should
take another vote.

557
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:52,859
Good idea.

558
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:54,927
Let's just see
who stands where, all right?

559
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:56,763
Everybody back.

560
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:59,198
Now, just by
a show of hands,

561
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,867
who's still voting guilty?

562
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,268
Guilty.

563
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:05,972
Not guilty.

564
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:10,309
Six to six.

565
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,645
And we go into
extra innings.

566
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,749
(Natalie)
Mr. Monk,
it's a woman!

567
00:25:16,783 --> 00:25:19,886
She's about
60 years old!

568
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,087
Who is she?

569
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,989
No ID.

570
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:23,956
No ID!

571
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,091
No idea?

572
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:27,259
No ID!

573
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:28,561
No idea?

574
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:31,564
NO ID!

575
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:32,599
No idea?

576
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:39,639
No...I...

577
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:40,640
D!

578
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:42,008
No idea?

579
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,577
No...

580
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:46,045
Here here here.

581
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:56,322
I...

582
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:57,590
D!

583
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:02,228
No idea?

584
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:04,997
No ID!
No ID!

585
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:06,365
No idea?

586
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,667
Check her identification!

587
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,137
No ID!

588
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,171
No ID!

589
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:13,973
Are those
orthopedic shoes?

590
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:14,974
What?

591
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:17,043
Those shoes,
orthopedic shoes.

592
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:20,913
Yeah, I think so!

593
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:26,118
I remember I saw her
in the waiting room!

594
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:27,219
I think she's a juror!

595
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,220
What?

596
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,221
A juror!
What?

597
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,222
A juror!

598
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,625
What the hell is that?

599
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:34,193
Looks like of your jurors
leaning out of a window

600
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,062
talking to
a police officer.

601
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,698
I want that jury sequestered
as of now.

602
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:45,304
[breathing deeply]

603
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,048
What are youse doing?

604
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:33,786
You were smoking.

605
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,357
I'm allowed to smoke.
Read the sign.

606
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,359
It's keeping me awake.

607
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,029
You're gonna
start a fire.

608
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:45,097
So there's no problem.
You're awake, right?

609
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:47,033
[coughing]

610
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:49,101
If there's a fire,
you'll see it.

611
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:50,002
And you put it out, right?

612
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:52,271
Hey, right?

613
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:53,305
Right.
Right.

614
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:04,416
Don't be such an ass
in the jury room.

615
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,419
[breathing deeply]

616
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:10,189
Good night.

617
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:13,092
Good night.

618
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,032
I'd like to confirm
a reservation

619
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,334
for tomorrow afternoon.

620
00:28:55,367 --> 00:29:01,140
My reservation number
is X73294.

621
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,776
Yes, flight 32
to Buenos Aires.

622
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:07,113
The two of us,
me and my husband.

623
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:09,882
4:30.

624
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:12,952
Don't worry,
we won't be late.

625
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,859
Lieutenant,
my nose itches.

626
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:20,893
Forget it.

627
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,995
Ah, it doesn't matter.

628
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:26,498
I'll scratch it myself
soon enough.

629
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:32,839
Captain, he just said
he was gonna scratch his nose.

630
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:34,907
Okay.

631
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:39,912
The way he said it,
it was like a threat.

632
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:43,282
He threatened
to scratch his nose?

633
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:45,051
Lieutenant,
bring the van around.

634
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:47,086
Let's get this over with.

635
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:54,460
Not guilty?

636
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:55,461
It's still 8 to 4.

637
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:56,863
Is that clock right?

638
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:58,097
(Teacher Juror)
Number 11.

639
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,932
You've made some
really good points.

640
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:00,900
I admit that.

641
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:03,002
But everything you said
about the timeline,

642
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:06,005
the location of the wound,
is all circumstantial.

643
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:08,007
Exactly, what he's doing is
he's taking the facts

644
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,109
and he's twisting them around
like a pretzel.

645
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:10,843
Now, where's the proof, man?

646
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:12,178
(Patel)
We don't need any proof.

647
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:14,180
All we need is
a reasonable doubt.

648
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:15,314
You know what I say?

649
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:16,849
I say we're at
a deadlock.

650
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:18,384
And I say we go back
in there right now

651
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:19,385
and tell 'em
we got a hung jury.

652
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:20,386
What is he doing?

653
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:23,089
I'm afraid to ask.

654
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:24,857
Excuse me.

655
00:30:24,891 --> 00:30:27,459
Carl Palmer testified
that after he was stabbed,

656
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,595
he grabbed this towel

657
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,998
off the floor
of his car.

658
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:34,133
And he pressed it
against his leg.

659
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,134
So?

660
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:39,305
Well, look at the stains.

661
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,941
They're symmetrical.

662
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:45,111
I don't think
he just grabbed the towel.

663
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:49,015
I think he folded it...

664
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:51,117
very carefully.

665
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:55,054
Before he used it.

666
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:57,089
[murmurs of recognition]

667
00:30:57,123 --> 00:30:58,057
You know, so what?

668
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,091
The guy was a neatnik.

669
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,426
He was in pain.

670
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:01,227
He'd just been stabbed.

671
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,495
Nobody would stop
and fold a towel.

672
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:04,530
That's right.

673
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:08,234
He folded the towel
before he stabbed himself.

674
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:09,936
It was definitely
self-inflicted.

675
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:10,937
I'm convinced.

676
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,272
Me too.
Not guilty.

677
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:15,174
Thank you.

678
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,242
What about you?

679
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:29,922
Not guilty.

680
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,358
I'd like another vote.

681
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,926
Absolutely.

682
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,427
All of those
voting Not Guilty.

683
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:38,530
I'm switching my vote...

684
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:39,999
to guilty.

685
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,033
[all expressing disbelief]

686
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:43,235
What about the towel?

687
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:44,603
It means nothing to me.

688
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,139
The vote's 11 to 1.

689
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:49,141
Where are you going?

690
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:50,376
To the bathroom.

691
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,011
You got a problem
with that?

692
00:31:58,284 --> 00:31:59,285
Can you believe that?

693
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:01,253
No.

694
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:03,622
I can't.

695
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:10,496
You're a science teacher,
right?

696
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:12,031
Mm-hmm.

697
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:14,700
Is this what I think it is?

698
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:20,606
It's lime.

699
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,608
That's what I thought.

700
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:28,714
I think number 12 murdered
that woman in the dumpster.

701
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:30,182
Why?

702
00:32:30,216 --> 00:32:33,219
She needed to get
on a jury.

703
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:34,653
I remember her talking
to a woman

704
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,155
in the assembly room.

705
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:37,589
I think she was
looking for someone

706
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:40,059
who lived alone
with no family

707
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:41,160
who wouldn't be missed.

708
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:43,329
Killing somebody
to get on a jury?

709
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:44,997
That's a first.

710
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:47,033
She's been looking
at that clock all day.

711
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:49,335
That's right.

712
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:52,204
She's waiting for something.

713
00:32:52,238 --> 00:32:53,672
She's stalling us.

714
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,342
She doesn't care
what the verdict is.

715
00:32:56,375 --> 00:33:01,113
Look, whatever way we vote...

716
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:02,048
she will vote the opposite.

717
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:05,084
But in the first ballot,
she voted with us.

718
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:06,152
That's right.

719
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:08,087
(Monk)
But she was sitting
next to me.

720
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,122
She must have seen
how I was voting

721
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:11,257
and went the other way.

722
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,458
I don't believe it.

723
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,094
I can prove it,
I think.

724
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:16,695
But I'm gonna
need your help.

725
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,697
Wait a minute,
we can't just--

726
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,134
Yesterday, you said
we were partners.

727
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:24,636
I can't do this alone.

728
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:34,180
What'd I miss?

729
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:36,682
(Monk)
Well, we were
just talking and...

730
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:41,253
Well, we thought about it,
and we've decided

731
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:43,189
that you were right.

732
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:45,157
He's guilty.

733
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:48,194
Really?

734
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:50,829
Yeah, we're all
changing our vote.

735
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,465
In fact,
let's make it official.

736
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:56,034
Who's voting guilty?

737
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,439
I'm undecided.

738
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:01,740
Just give me
a few minutes.

739
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,109
What are you up to?

740
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:05,244
I have every right
to change my mind.

741
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:07,279
I think it's time
to call the bailiff.

742
00:34:07,313 --> 00:34:09,215
Have a seat, number 11.

743
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:11,483
We're still deliberating.

744
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:42,548
Number 11,
I have to thank you.

745
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,184
I had to keep everybody
here in this room busy

746
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:47,753
arguing for
a day and a half.

747
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,188
I wasn't sure
how I was gonna do it,

748
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:50,556
but you made it easy.

749
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:51,557
(Monk)
Don't mention it.

750
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,624
Why are you doing this?

751
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:55,127
She's helping her boyfriend
escape.

752
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:58,430
She had to have a way
to get into this building.

753
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:01,133
How about
a little privacy, huh?

754
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:02,134
It's not even.

755
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:03,435
It's not even--

756
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:04,836
Shut up!

757
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,272
It's not even.

758
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:07,339
I've been waiting a long time
to do this.

759
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:09,175
This is not...

760
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,242
[grunting]

761
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:17,483
[bell rings]

762
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:44,343
Listen, did you
check upstairs?

763
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:45,277
There's a dropped ceiling--

764
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:46,912
Whatever it is, Captain,
we got it covered.

765
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:48,380
Right.

766
00:35:48,414 --> 00:35:50,449
Okay.

767
00:35:58,357 --> 00:35:59,325
What's that?

768
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:00,792
It's your receipt.

769
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:02,294
Why don't you keep it...

770
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:04,796
as a souvenir?

771
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,988
[muffled screams]

772
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:15,394
[knocking on door]

773
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:17,696
(Natalie)
Mr. Monk, is everything okay?

774
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:20,466
[muffled screaming]

775
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,606
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

776
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,041
Mr. Monk, what happened?

777
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:34,846
[trying to talk]

778
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,382
What?
Hold on.

779
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:41,520
Ah!

780
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:42,754
What?

781
00:38:42,788 --> 00:38:44,690
I was saying
for the love of God,

782
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:46,057
please don't rip off
the tape!

783
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:48,126
Are you guys okay?

784
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,496
Is everyone all right?

785
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:57,068
[gunshots]

786
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:10,882
You did it,
Preciosa.

787
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:14,119
[exhales]

788
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:15,921
[cell phone ringing]

789
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:21,727
Disher.

790
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,829
Shots fired, third floor.

791
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:31,036
Oh, God!

792
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:32,904
Give me paramedics on three.

793
00:39:32,938 --> 00:39:36,508
We're in the North Wing.
We have two agents down.

794
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:37,509
They're gonna be okay.

795
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:38,744
They were both
wearing vests.

796
00:39:40,946 --> 00:39:44,416
They went up.

797
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:48,487
Why would they go upstairs?

798
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,689
Can I borrow that?

799
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,725
Well, he didn't
come through here.

800
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:55,026
Get somebody
in the basement.

801
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,127
Get somebody
in the basement.

802
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:57,929
Lock down
the parking garage.

803
00:39:57,963 --> 00:39:59,164
Disher.

804
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:01,199
Captain!
Captain!

805
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,502
It's Monk.

806
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:04,936
Monk?
Right here, this way.

807
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,505
Slowly.
Calm.

808
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:07,873
Outside.

809
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,040
Look out!
Look out!

810
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:19,518
Hello, Miguel!

811
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:20,852
And you must be
the fiancee.

812
00:40:21,987 --> 00:40:23,955
Aren't you supposed to be
upstairs?

813
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,493
Some people will do anything
to get out of jury duty.

814
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:30,161
Step down, please.

815
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:43,742
And this is number 6.

816
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,076
She didn't say much,
but she was

817
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,111
a very important
part of the team.

818
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:48,079
Stay cool.

819
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,181
I will.
I'll stay cool.

820
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:51,883
Yeah.

821
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:55,153
Part of the team, huh?
Good for you.

822
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,254
Yeah.

823
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,989
And this is number 2.
Natalie.

824
00:40:58,023 --> 00:40:58,990
Hello.

825
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:00,692
You should listen
to this man.

826
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:02,594
He is good for America.

827
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:05,230
And this is number 7.

828
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:06,965
We were kinda co-captains,
really.

829
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:10,836
I mean, sort of.

830
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:11,970
And that's number 4.

831
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:13,739
He sorta hated my guts
in the beginning.

832
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:14,806
You can admit it now.

833
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,642
I'll see you
at the reunion, okay?

834
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:18,043
One year from today.

835
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,645
Benihana's.

836
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:22,080
You know,
that's not gonna happen.

837
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:31,022
I think I'll stay
and straighten up.

838
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:32,057
No.

839
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,162
Going.

840
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:00,952
