<SYNC Start=2784><P Class=ENCC>
Ladies and gentlemen,<br>
if you follow me, 
<SYNC Start=4560><P Class=ENCC>
I think you would find<br>
this next room very interested.
<SYNC Start=8143><P Class=ENCC>
You can do what you get to canvass but...
<SYNC Start=10279><P Class=ENCC>
this is the world famous<br>
Cromwell family exhibit.
<SYNC Start=14110><P Class=ENCC>
I still get goosebumps<br>
everytime I walk into this room.
<SYNC Start=17673><P Class=ENCC>
It is the largest private collection <br>
in Europe.
<SYNC Start=19862><P Class=ENCC>
The Cromwell family has<br>
collected everything
<SYNC Start=22048><P Class=ENCC>
from furniture and paintings<br>
to medieval weaponry.
<SYNC Start=24876><P Class=ENCC>
This, of course, is<br>
the crown jewel of the exhibit.
<SYNC Start=28997><P Class=ENCC>
No pun intended.
<SYNC Start=30719><P Class=ENCC>
The Alexander diamond.
<SYNC Start=32474><P Class=ENCC>
It was worn by queen Elizabeth<br>
at her coronation.
<SYNC Start=35975><P Class=ENCC>
Experts have called it the most<br>
perfect diamond in the world.
<SYNC Start=40294><P Class=ENCC>
You're probably wondering<br>
what it's worth.
<SYNC Start=42576><P Class=ENCC>
Actually, no one knows.<br>
But I can tell you this.
<SYNC Start=45762><P Class=ENCC>
That little rock has been insured by<br>
Lloyd's of London for $20 million.

<SYNC Start=211579><P Class=ENCC>
- That's $42.80.<br>
- Okay, there we go.
<SYNC Start=215668><P Class=ENCC>
And I have a coupon.
<SYNC Start=218363><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=220836><P Class=ENCC>
I can't take this,<br>
it expired yesterday.
<SYNC Start=222847><P Class=ENCC>
Yesterday?<br>
Oh, she's right.
<SYNC Start=226266><P Class=ENCC>
Darn. Sometimes I wish<br>
I had a time machine.
<SYNC Start=230148><P Class=ENCC>
Wait, if you had a time machine,
<SYNC Start=232082><P Class=ENCC>
you would use it to go back<br>
to save 50 cents on lysol?
<SYNC Start=234642><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. Yes, I would.
<SYNC Start=236612><P Class=ENCC>
You wouldn't use it<br>
to save Abraham Lincoln?
<SYNC Start=238698><P Class=ENCC>
Fine, I'll save Lincoln.<br>
It never ends with you.
<SYNC Start=241296><P Class=ENCC>
Sir, do you have a different card?<br>
It says declined.
<SYNC Start=243986><P Class=ENCC>
Declined?
<SYNC Start=245661><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Monk, do you have<br>
any money in the bank?
<SYNC Start=248719><P Class=ENCC>
No. / That could be it.<br>
Okay.
<SYNC Start=253235><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=253866><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sorry.<br>
Please hurry.
<SYNC Start=256216><P Class=ENCC>
All right, I've got...<br>
$34. / Is that it?
<SYNC Start=262064><P Class=ENCC>
Yesterday was payday.
<SYNC Start=263612><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, it was.<br>
But I didn't get paid.
<SYNC Start=265842><P Class=ENCC>
You know, your paydays are<br>
becoming sort of theoretical.
<SYNC Start=269132><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, you need to put<br>
some stuff back. / No, I can't.
<SYNC Start=272710><P Class=ENCC>
Look, I, I...
<SYNC Start=275203><P Class=ENCC>
I made a list.<br>
Everything here is on the list.
<SYNC Start=277748><P Class=ENCC>
I know, I know. We're gonna<br>
come back later and pick it up.
<SYNC Start=280903><P Class=ENCC>
- Come on, people are waiting.<br>
- Okay.
<SYNC Start=284142><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=284717><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, this then. Oh, wait, no.<br>
I need this.
<SYNC Start=289912><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, this.<br>
Gotta have this spray.
<SYNC Start=292776><P Class=ENCC>
All right, how about...<br>
how about one of these?
<SYNC Start=295726><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, this one.<br>
No, no. Um, no.
<SYNC Start=299689><P Class=ENCC>
Let's go with that one. All right.<br>
Oh, wait a second.
<SYNC Start=301803><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, hurry up!
<SYNC Start=303608><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=304345><P Class=ENCC>
It's like Sophie's choice.<br>
Except it's soup.
<SYNC Start=309033><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, we're keeping the soup.
<SYNC Start=310619><P Class=ENCC>
Putting back this, this, this, and this.
<SYNC Start=315077><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Monk, look at us.<br>
This is ridiculous. We're both broke.
<SYNC Start=317884><P Class=ENCC>
We haven't had a new case<br>
in three weeks.
<SYNC Start=320164><P Class=ENCC>
What do you want me to do?
<SYNC Start=321366><P Class=ENCC>
You need to get a raise.<br>
You gotta talk to the captain.
<SYNC Start=323069><P Class=ENCC>
We can't go on like this.
<SYNC Start=324835><P Class=ENCC>
I'm not good at this,<br>
asking for more money.
<SYNC Start=327973><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, then let me do the talking.
<SYNC Start=330665><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=331013><P Class=ENCC>
- I'm not good at that either.<br>
- Mr. Monk, you deserve a raise.
<SYNC Start=334902><P Class=ENCC>
You've solved a lot of big cases<br>
for them single-handedly.
<SYNC Start=337691><P Class=ENCC>
- Maybe I helped a little.<br>
- No, no, no, no.
<SYNC Start=339852><P Class=ENCC>
You can't think like that.
<SYNC Start=341246><P Class=ENCC>
You gotta brag about yourself.<br>
You gotta toot your own horn.
<SYNC Start=343746><P Class=ENCC>
I'm not much of a tooter.
<SYNC Start=345248><P Class=ENCC>
You better learn how to toot.
<SYNC Start=346872><P Class=ENCC>
- Toot's a funny word.<br>
- Hilarious.
<SYNC Start=349321><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, hello. Gladys.
<SYNC Start=350907><P Class=ENCC>
Natalie Teeger, this is Gladys.<br>
Gladys is great.
<SYNC Start=354078><P Class=ENCC>
Gladys has been cleaning up<br>
around here for years.
<SYNC Start=356495><P Class=ENCC>
I used to help her out<br>
in my spare time.
<SYNC Start=359228><P Class=ENCC>
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Remember?<br>
- Yeah.
<SYNC Start=362487><P Class=ENCC>
Until I got that restraining order.<br>
Remember?
<SYNC Start=365279><P Class=ENCC>
Good times. Good times.
<SYNC Start=368515><P Class=ENCC>
You have to get underneath, right,<br>
Gladys? Under?
<SYNC Start=371883><P Class=ENCC>
Why?<br>
Nobody ever looks there.
<SYNC Start=374057><P Class=ENCC>
But you'll know it's clean.<br>
Isn't that its own reward? You'll know.
<SYNC Start=378102><P Class=ENCC>
The captain says I don't<br>
have to talk to you.
<SYNC Start=380421><P Class=ENCC>
I know, I know. But under, okay?<br>
Under the table.
<SYNC Start=383521><P Class=ENCC>
I wanna help you guys, okay?<br>
I really do.
<SYNC Start=385500><P Class=ENCC>
They already questioned me four times.
<SYNC Start=387522><P Class=ENCC>
It's not just you, Mr. Landis.
<SYNC Start=389023><P Class=ENCC>
We're talking to all the guards,<br>
the cleaning staff,
<SYNC Start=391179><P Class=ENCC>
curators, anybody who was<br>
at the museum.
<SYNC Start=393218><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, but I haven't even<br>
been home yet.
<SYNC Start=395119><P Class=ENCC>
And I appreciate that.
<SYNC Start=396577><P Class=ENCC>
We just need your official statement,<br>
then you're free to go.
<SYNC Start=398971><P Class=ENCC>
So for the record,<br>
where were you during the robbery?
<SYNC Start=401179><P Class=ENCC>
For the fifth time, okay?
<SYNC Start=402621><P Class=ENCC>
I was at my station on the main floor.<br>
I never left.
<SYNC Start=406169><P Class=ENCC>
- I didn't even go to the bathroom.<br>
- And you didn't hear anything unusual?
<SYNC Start=408967><P Class=ENCC>
No, sir.<br>
I was three floors away.
<SYNC Start=412088><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.
<SYNC Start=413470><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=413885><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me for a second.<br>
Can I get you something to drink? / No.
<SYNC Start=417853><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=421071><P Class=ENCC>
- Monk, Nat. / What's going on?<br>
- Oh, you haven't heard?
<SYNC Start=423754><P Class=ENCC>
Robbery at the MacMillan museum.<br>
It was big big.
<SYNC Start=427591><P Class=ENCC>
- The Alexander diamond.<br>
- Whoa.
<SYNC Start=429779><P Class=ENCC>
I know whoa.<br>
Robbery division asked us to help out,
<SYNC Start=432597><P Class=ENCC>
so we're taking statements<br>
from everybody on site.
<SYNC Start=434710><P Class=ENCC>
So you're not arresting him<br>
about the drugs.
<SYNC Start=437190><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, no. What drugs?
<SYNC Start=438826><P Class=ENCC>
His fingertips are stained.<br>
Looks like red phosphorous.
<SYNC Start=443210><P Class=ENCC>
You get that from making crystal meth.<br>
He's gotta have a lab somewhere.
<SYNC Start=447374><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, I'll check it out.
<SYNC Start=449901><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me, Mr. Landis.<br>
Could you come here, please?
<SYNC Start=453804><P Class=ENCC>
If the captain needs me,<br>
I'll be in interrogation room B.
<SYNC Start=457224><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, right this way.
<SYNC Start=459473><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=462491><P Class=ENCC>
- What?<br>
- You know what.
<SYNC Start=464111><P Class=ENCC>
You just solved that case for free.
<SYNC Start=466851><P Class=ENCC>
What was I supposed to do?
<SYNC Start=468216><P Class=ENCC>
Well, if you're selling ice cream,<br>
would you hand out free scoops?
<SYNC Start=471026><P Class=ENCC>
What was I supposed to say?
<SYNC Start=472741><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, lieutenant, there's a drug dealer<br>
somewhere in this room.
<SYNC Start=475269><P Class=ENCC>
- I'll tell you who it is for $20.<br>
- At least we'd have $20.
<SYNC Start=478879><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=479508><P Class=ENCC>
All right, there's the captain.
<SYNC Start=480434><P Class=ENCC>
Remember, you deserve a raise.<br>
You deserve it!
<SYNC Start=483428><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, when you're right,<br>
you're right.
<SYNC Start=485375><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, captain?  / Hey, monk.<br>
What are you doing here?
<SYNC Start=487873><P Class=ENCC>
Captain, I have to talk to you<br>
about something. / Can it wait?
<SYNC Start=490549><P Class=ENCC>
Okay. Well, we'll come back.
<SYNC Start=493047><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=493887><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, we're back.
<SYNC Start=496382><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=498119><P Class=ENCC>
And...<br>
Natalie?
<SYNC Start=501645><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=502058><P Class=ENCC>
Captain... / If this is about money,<br>
forget about it. We're broke.
<SYNC Start=505414><P Class=ENCC>
The department is strapped.<br>
We just got another hiring freeze.
<SYNC Start=509328><P Class=ENCC>
Captain, we haven't had<br>
a new case in three weeks.
<SYNC Start=512298><P Class=ENCC>
You know, you're right. There hasn't<br>
been a major homicide in a long time.
<SYNC Start=515715><P Class=ENCC>
But you gotta keep your hopes up.<br>
Stay optimistic.
<SYNC Start=518037><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, well, thank you very much.
<SYNC Start=519531><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, captain, come on, we can't just<br>
sit around waiting for the phone to ring.
<SYNC Start=521928><P Class=ENCC>
It's not fair to us.<br>
We have no security.
<SYNC Start=524674><P Class=ENCC>
What do you want me to do?
<SYNC Start=526207><P Class=ENCC>
- We wanna be put on retainer.<br>
- What?
<SYNC Start=528606><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, retainer like a lawyer.<br>
We want a guaranteed income.
<SYNC Start=532006><P Class=ENCC>
Look, it doesn't have to be much.<br>
We just need a little security. / Yes.
<SYNC Start=536390><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=538093><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, I'll see what I can do.<br>
But don't get your hopes up, okay?
<SYNC Start=542262><P Class=ENCC>
Anything else?
<SYNC Start=544334><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=545598><P Class=ENCC>
It's about Gladys.
<SYNC Start=549340><P Class=ENCC>
- Have you been talking to Gladys?<br>
- Captain...
<SYNC Start=551152><P Class=ENCC>
I told you not to talk to Gladys.
<SYNC Start=552695><P Class=ENCC>
She's not cleaning under the tables again.
<SYNC Start=556500><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=564142><P Class=ENCC>
I think you should talk to her.
<SYNC Start=566286><P Class=ENCC>
I will. About her aim.
<SYNC Start=570174><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=574950><P Class=ENCC>
Get him downstairs.
<SYNC Start=577010><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=578852><P Class=ENCC>
You were right.
<SYNC Start=580567><P Class=ENCC>
I get this guy in the room,
<SYNC Start=582230><P Class=ENCC>
he's denying everything.<br>
He's twitching, he's nervous.
<SYNC Start=584745><P Class=ENCC>
I threaten to get a search warrant<br>
and tear his house apart.
<SYNC Start=587013><P Class=ENCC>
I pick up the phone,<br>
I start to dial, he collapses.
<SYNC Start=589993><P Class=ENCC>
He gave it all up.<br>
Crystal meth lab in his basement.
<SYNC Start=593394><P Class=ENCC>
Narcotics is on their way over.
<SYNC Start=595513><P Class=ENCC>
- I owe you one.<br>
- Okay.
<SYNC Start=597951><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=598842><P Class=ENCC>
- What?<br>
- You know what.
<SYNC Start=600908><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, the thing?
<SYNC Start=603458><P Class=ENCC>
- About the ice cream and the free scoops?<br>
- That's right.
<SYNC Start=606574><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=611580><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Monk?
<SYNC Start=613142><P Class=ENCC>
- We're rich. We hit the jackpot.<br>
- Oh, good.
<SYNC Start=615946><P Class=ENCC>
Look, it's about the Alexander diamond.
<SYNC Start=617984><P Class=ENCC>
Lloyd's of London is offering a $1 million<br>
reward to anybody that finds it.
<SYNC Start=621665><P Class=ENCC>
- No questions asked.<br>
- So?
<SYNC Start=624573><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Monk, you can find that diamond.
<SYNC Start=627657><P Class=ENCC>
Ah, I don't think so.
<SYNC Start=628933><P Class=ENCC>
What?<br>
You're a great detective.
<SYNC Start=630935><P Class=ENCC>
You solve crimes all the time<br>
without even trying.
<SYNC Start=632912><P Class=ENCC>
It's annoying how many crimes<br>
you solve. Come on!
<SYNC Start=635638><P Class=ENCC>
Let's go for it.<br>
Let's cash in!
<SYNC Start=638452><P Class=ENCC>
Natalie, I don't do what I do for money.
<SYNC Start=643111><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Monk, it's a million dollars.
<SYNC Start=645287><P Class=ENCC>
You'll never have to worry<br>
for the rest of your life.
<SYNC Start=649627><P Class=ENCC>
Well, of course, you'll worry.<br>
But not about money.
<SYNC Start=653464><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=653989><P Class=ENCC>
- I don't know.<br>
- Mr. Monk, you have to do this.
<SYNC Start=657069><P Class=ENCC>
I mean, I love this job,<br>
but I have to get paid.
<SYNC Start=660307><P Class=ENCC>
Just, just please.
<SYNC Start=662885><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=663804><P Class=ENCC>
Just say yes. Say you'll do it.<br>
Just say yes!
<SYNC Start=667779><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=668223><P Class=ENCC>
Could you get off my counter?
<SYNC Start=671237><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=674121><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, fine.<br>
I'll do it.
<SYNC Start=676298><P Class=ENCC>
A million dollars, a million dollars. 
<SYNC Start=681233><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=681747><P Class=ENCC>
Congratulations.
<SYNC Start=684578><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=713621><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me.<br>
Any suspect yet?
<SYNC Start=716213><P Class=ENCC>
I wouldn't know,<br>
I'm just delivering flowers.
<SYNC Start=718456><P Class=ENCC>
No, you're not. You're<br>
a private detective, just like me.
<SYNC Start=721509><P Class=ENCC>
- Well, not quite like me.<br>
- Me, a detective?
<SYNC Start=724928><P Class=ENCC>
That's pretty funny, actually.
<SYNC Start=726963><P Class=ENCC>
I can't wait to tell the guys back at...
<SYNC Start=728529><P Class=ENCC>
Look, you're insulting me.<br>
That satellite dish on your roof.
<SYNC Start=731479><P Class=ENCC>
The number on the side, 555.<br>
Obviously a fake.
<SYNC Start=735588><P Class=ENCC>
Conclusion number one, you're<br>
after the Alexander diamond.
<SYNC Start=739295><P Class=ENCC>
Conclusion number two.<br>
You haven't got a prayer.
<SYNC Start=743560><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me, that's a handicapped spot.
<SYNC Start=747037><P Class=ENCC>
It's okay, I'm psychotic.
<SYNC Start=749342><P Class=ENCC>
Is this where they stole the rock?
<SYNC Start=751302><P Class=ENCC>
- You addressing me?<br>
- Not anymore.
<SYNC Start=753488><P Class=ENCC>
You, Poindexter.<br>
Is this the scene of the crime?
<SYNC Start=756982><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me, boys, I got a million<br>
dollars waiting for me inside.
<SYNC Start=761065><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=787930><P Class=ENCC>
Ah, apparently we think alike.
<SYNC Start=790178><P Class=ENCC>
Frightening thought for those<br>
of us who aren't you.
<SYNC Start=793204><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, Phillip Wick.<br>
Access to all areas. This'll do me.
<SYNC Start=797101><P Class=ENCC>
Hello again.
<SYNC Start=798965><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=801819><P Class=ENCC>
What does this say?
<SYNC Start=803694><P Class=ENCC>
Curator Sally Kanter.
<SYNC Start=805496><P Class=ENCC>
Here, try this one, Robert Gant.<br>
That's a boy's name.
<SYNC Start=809070><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, look, chaps,<br>
since we're all after the same thing,
<SYNC Start=812408><P Class=ENCC>
- why don't we just pool our talents?<br>
- What are you talking about?
<SYNC Start=815874><P Class=ENCC>
Well, work together and split the reward.
<SYNC Start=818707><P Class=ENCC>
Why don't we begin by<br>
introducing ourselves, all right?
<SYNC Start=820983><P Class=ENCC>
My name's st. Clare.<br>
Retired Scotland yard inspector.
<SYNC Start=824462><P Class=ENCC>
- I moved to San Francisco...<br>
- I'm interrupting you.
<SYNC Start=827056><P Class=ENCC>
No frigging way.<br>
I'm finding that rock myself.
<SYNC Start=830488><P Class=ENCC>
And I'm keeping all the money.
<SYNC Start=832353><P Class=ENCC>
- Well, may the best man win.<br>
- I intend to.
<SYNC Start=835513><P Class=ENCC>
He said man.
<SYNC Start=837560><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=840871><P Class=ENCC>
This entire wing was locked.<br>
I mean, it was completely locked down.
<SYNC Start=844584><P Class=ENCC>
Somehow they opened that connecting<br>
door from the inside.
<SYNC Start=847465><P Class=ENCC>
We can't figure it out.
<SYNC Start=849330><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=850167><P Class=ENCC>
- What do you think?<br>
- I don't know yet.
<SYNC Start=852410><P Class=ENCC>
Well, come on, focus. Concentrate.<br>
Do that thing you do.
<SYNC Start=855953><P Class=ENCC>
- I've never seen you like this.<br>
- What, broke?
<SYNC Start=859775><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=865522><P Class=ENCC>
- What, what, what, what?<br>
- These scratches here and here.
<SYNC Start=870974><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=871237><P Class=ENCC>
Looks like these tire irons<br>
weren't heavy enough to do the job.
<SYNC Start=876351><P Class=ENCC>
Gentlemen, we have competition.<br>
That is Adrian Monk.
<SYNC Start=880752><P Class=ENCC>
Adrian monk?<br>
I thought he worked homicide.
<SYNC Start=882817><P Class=ENCC>
What are you two afraid of?
<SYNC Start=886129><P Class=ENCC>
- Something's off here.<br>
- What is it?
<SYNC Start=890208><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=893235><P Class=ENCC>
Glass shards on the inside.
<SYNC Start=897094><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=898663><P Class=ENCC>
When that case was shattered,
<SYNC Start=902120><P Class=ENCC>
this case was open.
<SYNC Start=904612><P Class=ENCC>
I think they took this weapon,<br>
used it,
<SYNC Start=908026><P Class=ENCC>
and put it back and relocked the case.
<SYNC Start=910675><P Class=ENCC>
- What does that tell us?<br>
- A lot.
<SYNC Start=913092><P Class=ENCC>
It means it was an inside job.
<SYNC Start=914631><P Class=ENCC>
And they didn't want us to know<br>
it was an inside job.
<SYNC Start=919197><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=919487><P Class=ENCC>
- Ka-ching!<br>
- What does that mean?
<SYNC Start=921274><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=BFEFFF>
It means we're gonna be rich.<br>
Ka-ching.
<SYNC Start=924690><P Class=ENCC>
This guy's good.
<SYNC Start=926635><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=926912><P Class=ENCC>
What's he saying?
<SYNC Start=928660><P Class=ENCC>
- Put that thing away.<br>
- What's the problem with you?
<SYNC Start=931554><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me, sir.
<SYNC Start=933493><P Class=ENCC>
Did anything unusual happen<br>
Tuesday before the break-in?
<SYNC Start=937870><P Class=ENCC>
Anything at all out of the ordinary?
<SYNC Start=940909><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=941515><P Class=ENCC>
Now that you mention it,
<SYNC Start=943568><P Class=ENCC>
Tuesday afternoon I heard, or I thought<br>
I heard somebody whispering.
<SYNC Start=947418><P Class=ENCC>
Whispering?
<SYNC Start=948672><P Class=ENCC>
It wasn't in this room,<br>
it was down the hallway.
<SYNC Start=952212><P Class=ENCC>
It was about 2:30.<br>
I was standing about there.
<SYNC Start=956037><P Class=ENCC>
And I thought I heard someone<br>
saying, "my womb."
<SYNC Start=960470><P Class=ENCC>
"My room"?
<SYNC Start=961846><P Class=ENCC>
"My womb." It was a man's voice.
<SYNC Start=963688><P Class=ENCC>
And he was saying it<br>
over and over. / My womb...
<SYNC Start=966208><P Class=ENCC>
I thought it was coming from that vent,<br>
but it's impossible.
<SYNC Start=969500><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=969904><P Class=ENCC>
I think I'm going senile.
<SYNC Start=972286><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sorry, I've got to take this.<br>
Hello?
<SYNC Start=975053><P Class=ENCC>
- My womb.<br>
- My womb.
<SYNC Start=976186><P Class=ENCC>
It sounds like a mantra like a meditation.
<SYNC Start=978971><P Class=ENCC>
My womb.
<SYNC Start=981101><P Class=ENCC>
My womb. My...
<SYNC Start=985379><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=997092><P Class=ENCC>
- Look at this.<br>
- What?
<SYNC Start=998658><P Class=ENCC>
It's a footprint.
<SYNC Start=1000510><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1001661><P Class=ENCC>
Somebody was hiding in here.
<SYNC Start=1005396><P Class=ENCC>
Wait, in there?
<SYNC Start=1007131><P Class=ENCC>
That's how they opened the connecting door.
<SYNC Start=1011148><P Class=ENCC>
Let's grab the detectives,<br>
we need an evidence kit.
<SYNC Start=1013098><P Class=ENCC>
- Wait, not yet.<br>
- What do you mean, not yet?
<SYNC Start=1015151><P Class=ENCC>
Let's find the diamond,<br>
then we'll tell them how we did it.
<SYNC Start=1017421><P Class=ENCC>
Natalie, this is not a game show.
<SYNC Start=1019417><P Class=ENCC>
This is a felony investi...
<SYNC Start=1023230><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1028146><P Class=ENCC>
It's a broken necklace.
<SYNC Start=1030855><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1031626><P Class=ENCC>
- That's an unusual design.<br>
- Oh, good.
<SYNC Start=1034275><P Class=ENCC>
We'll try to ID it.<br>
Come on, let's get out of here.
<SYNC Start=1037970><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1040109><P Class=ENCC>
Sorry.
<SYNC Start=1041684><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1044136><P Class=ENCC>
You okay?
<SYNC Start=1046043><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1047185><P Class=ENCC>
I don't know, something's...<br>
something's wrong.
<SYNC Start=1050651><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1051992><P Class=ENCC>
I'm not balanced.
<SYNC Start=1054479><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1059488><P Class=ENCC>
Um, excuse me.
<SYNC Start=1061571><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, um, I'm gonna<br>
be needing that back.
<SYNC Start=1063669><P Class=ENCC>
Because I only have two of them<br>
and the other one doesn't work.
<SYNC Start=1066860><P Class=ENCC>
- Are you following us?<br>
- What?
<SYNC Start=1070002><P Class=ENCC>
Ah, Mr. Monk. What an honor.
<SYNC Start=1071997><P Class=ENCC>
My name's st. Clare.<br>
Inspector st. Clare.
<SYNC Start=1073736><P Class=ENCC>
I've been following your cases assiduously<br>
from across the pond, you know.
<SYNC Start=1077013><P Class=ENCC>
Shakespeare, nobody cares.
<SYNC Start=1079102><P Class=ENCC>
Wait, I can't believe you're following us.
<SYNC Start=1080995><P Class=ENCC>
- Is that a lead?<br>
- Maybe.
<SYNC Start=1083277><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1084658><P Class=ENCC>
Look, Mr. St. Clare. Inspector.
<SYNC Start=1087188><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sure a gentleman like yourself<br>
can appreciate the fact
<SYNC Start=1089655><P Class=ENCC>
- that these two leads belong to us.<br>
- Two leads?
<SYNC Start=1093959><P Class=ENCC>
Well, yes, the necklace and<br>
the initials carved in the desk.
<SYNC Start=1097701><P Class=ENCC>
- Mr. Monk.<br>
- I'm sorry.
<SYNC Start=1100130><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1101512><P Class=ENCC>
Go, go, go, go.
<SYNC Start=1104308><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1109088><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me.
<SYNC Start=1111372><P Class=ENCC>
My name is Jennie Mandeville.
<SYNC Start=1113186><P Class=ENCC>
And I did something I'd like to confess.
<SYNC Start=1118297><P Class=ENCC>
What'd you do, Jennie?
<SYNC Start=1120606><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1123426><P Class=ENCC>
I robbed a bank.
<SYNC Start=1125733><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1126552><P Class=ENCC>
It was about three weeks ago.<br>
The community savings trust in Sausalito.
<SYNC Start=1131239><P Class=ENCC>
Sausalito.
<SYNC Start=1133271><P Class=ENCC>
- I don't remember anything about that.<br>
- I'll take it.
<SYNC Start=1136941><P Class=ENCC>
Hi, I'm lieutenant Disher.<br>
Uh, Jennie. Miss Mandeville.
<SYNC Start=1142012><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1148515><P Class=ENCC>
Just have a seat.
<SYNC Start=1150847><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1156056><P Class=ENCC>
- Uh, is there a problem?<br>
- I'm claustrophobic.
<SYNC Start=1159799><P Class=ENCC>
Is this the only room that you have?
<SYNC Start=1161890><P Class=ENCC>
All the rooms are the same size, miss.<br>
Please, just have a seat.
<SYNC Start=1168109><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1169582><P Class=ENCC>
This is lieutenant Disher. I'm in<br>
interrogation room A with Jennie Mandeville.
<SYNC Start=1174544><P Class=ENCC>
- So you say you robbed a bank.<br>
- That's right.
<SYNC Start=1179772><P Class=ENCC>
I went inside and...
<SYNC Start=1183223><P Class=ENCC>
I saw one of those pens.
<SYNC Start=1185375><P Class=ENCC>
You know, chained to the desk?
<SYNC Start=1187864><P Class=ENCC>
And I really needed a pen.
<SYNC Start=1190303><P Class=ENCC>
So I snapped it off<br>
and I put it in my purse.
<SYNC Start=1195670><P Class=ENCC>
You stole a pen?
<SYNC Start=1198450><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1200409><P Class=ENCC>
One pen?
<SYNC Start=1203325><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1203936><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, god.<br>
Do you think god will forgive me?
<SYNC Start=1207409><P Class=ENCC>
I don't know, ma'am.
<SYNC Start=1209954><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1210472><P Class=ENCC>
But we do.<br>
You're free to go.
<SYNC Start=1215797><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1221884><P Class=ENCC>
What is up with those three detectives?<br>
Do you think we lost them?
<SYNC Start=1224243><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, Natalie, they are not detectives.<br>
They're rent-a-cops.
<SYNC Start=1228655><P Class=ENCC>
They're hired guns.<br>
They are mercenaries.
<SYNC Start=1230924><P Class=ENCC>
In other words, they're us.<br>
This whole thing is about greed.
<SYNC Start=1234743><P Class=ENCC>
You know how you always say you'll<br>
thank me later? You'll thank me later.
<SYNC Start=1237766><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, that's gotta be him.
<SYNC Start=1239500><P Class=ENCC>
Hello, are you Mr. Kwan?
<SYNC Start=1241938><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1244818><P Class=ENCC>
I think he nodded. That...
<SYNC Start=1247402><P Class=ENCC>
was that a nod?<br>
Sir? Sir...
<SYNC Start=1253082><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1254460><P Class=ENCC>
If that was a nod, nod.
<SYNC Start=1257614><P Class=ENCC>
Sir, we found this at the scene<br>
of a crime. A robbery.
<SYNC Start=1260895><P Class=ENCC>
We've been doing some research.<br>
This is your design, isn't it?
<SYNC Start=1264024><P Class=ENCC>
- You give these to your students?<br>
- Natalie, please.
<SYNC Start=1266860><P Class=ENCC>
Sir, you, you have a thread...<br>
hanging right in the middle there.
<SYNC Start=1271578><P Class=ENCC>
Just... I'll get it.<br>
Just one moment...
<SYNC Start=1274207><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1275141><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, Mr. Kwan, you look like<br>
a very busy man,<br>
so I'm just gonna get right to the point.
<SYNC Start=1278929><P Class=ENCC>
Do you have a student that<br>
could fit inside of a roll-top desk?
<SYNC Start=1282337><P Class=ENCC>
He can't be more than five feet tall.<br>
Does that ring a bell? Or a gong?
<SYNC Start=1286810><P Class=ENCC>
- Mr. Monk, you're distracting him!<br>
- No, he's distracting me.
<SYNC Start=1290054><P Class=ENCC>
Is there anyone here<br>
who's that small and limber?
<SYNC Start=1292068><P Class=ENCC>
Who could scrunch up inside of a desk?
<SYNC Start=1293851><P Class=ENCC>
A scruncher? A little scruncher?
<SYNC Start=1295831><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Kwan, there's a lot<br>
of money at stake here. / I got it. I got it.
<SYNC Start=1298377><P Class=ENCC>
Well, well, well, Mr. Monk.<br>
We meet again.
<SYNC Start=1302646><P Class=ENCC>
Surprised?
<SYNC Start=1304775><P Class=ENCC>
Why don't you get your own clues?
<SYNC Start=1306148><P Class=ENCC>
Well, normally I do.<br>
But you two are so easy to follow.
<SYNC Start=1309097><P Class=ENCC>
Especially when you're kind enough<br>
to keep your emergency blinker on all day long.
<SYNC Start=1312700><P Class=ENCC>
- I told you.<br>
- It's the safest way to drive.
<SYNC Start=1315176><P Class=ENCC>
Wait, don't question anybody yet.
<SYNC Start=1318264><P Class=ENCC>
I have a voice stress analyzer.
<SYNC Start=1320603><P Class=ENCC>
I'll be able to tell<br>
if he's lying or not.
<SYNC Start=1322689><P Class=ENCC>
- He hasn't said anything.<br>
- You are a pathetic little frog, aren't you?
<SYNC Start=1326755><P Class=ENCC>
You thought you could lose me, huh?<br>
Well, you can all just relax.
<SYNC Start=1329023><P Class=ENCC>
Dirk'll take it from here.
<SYNC Start=1331158><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, hippie.
<SYNC Start=1333449><P Class=ENCC>
You in charge? My name is Dirk.<br>
I'm a professional bounty hunter.
<SYNC Start=1336600><P Class=ENCC>
I was wondering if I could<br>
have a word with you.
<SYNC Start=1338812><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe this'll change your mind.<br>
I got $200 here. / $200?
<SYNC Start=1342797><P Class=ENCC>
They do use money on your planet?
<SYNC Start=1345994><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1353363><P Class=ENCC>
- Cabin 14.<br>
- It doesn't say that.
<SYNC Start=1355173><P Class=ENCC>
- Do it!<br>
- You're good.
<SYNC Start=1358372><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1359529><P Class=ENCC>
$225.
<SYNC Start=1361511><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1362833><P Class=ENCC>
His name is Chasen.<br>
He's over at cabin 14.
<SYNC Start=1368138><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1372092><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, there he is. Let's go!
<SYNC Start=1374104><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, slow down.
<SYNC Start=1376109><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1376778><P Class=ENCC>
Come on!
<SYNC Start=1378943><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Monk, what are you doing?
<SYNC Start=1381160><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1382575><P Class=ENCC>
- No way to go away!<br>
- You got him. Mr. Monk!
<SYNC Start=1387033><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1387663><P Class=ENCC>
Get back here.
<SYNC Start=1390054><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1390424><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me.
<SYNC Start=1391797><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1392254><P Class=ENCC>
- Excuse me.<br>
- Get out of my way!
<SYNC Start=1394460><P Class=ENCC>
Hello, Mr. Chasen!
<SYNC Start=1396490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1397412><P Class=ENCC>
Is this your necklace?<br>
We found it in a museum.
<SYNC Start=1400014><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, where's the diamond?
<SYNC Start=1401803><P Class=ENCC>
Hey! Hey, I'm talking to you.
<SYNC Start=1405835><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1407550><P Class=ENCC>
Wow, that's a really deep trance.
<SYNC Start=1412473><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1414431><P Class=ENCC>
Couldn't be deeper.
<SYNC Start=1416657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1417082><P Class=ENCC>
This man is dead.
<SYNC Start=1420702><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1428953><P Class=ENCC>
Welcome back, miss Mandeville.<br>
Have a seat.
<SYNC Start=1432185><P Class=ENCC>
You know the drill.
<SYNC Start=1434339><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1436404><P Class=ENCC>
I don't like this room.
<SYNC Start=1438447><P Class=ENCC>
Please, miss Mandeville,
<SYNC Start=1440254><P Class=ENCC>
you said you had something<br>
important to tell me.
<SYNC Start=1441739><P Class=ENCC>
Something about a dead body.
<SYNC Start=1443515><P Class=ENCC>
And you said you didn't<br>
wanna talk in my office.
<SYNC Start=1446604><P Class=ENCC>
I told you, I'm claustrophobic.
<SYNC Start=1449459><P Class=ENCC>
What about another room?
<SYNC Start=1451232><P Class=ENCC>
All of our interrogation rooms<br>
are the same size, unfortunately.
<SYNC Start=1454709><P Class=ENCC>
No wet bars, no jacuzzis.<br>
Please just have a seat.
<SYNC Start=1460221><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1461765><P Class=ENCC>
Now, you said you found a body.<br>
Your roommate's body.
<SYNC Start=1467074><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1468181><P Class=ENCC>
This, uh, this is a real thing, right?
<SYNC Start=1471686><P Class=ENCC>
Not like, uh, stealing the pen<br>
from the bank?
<SYNC Start=1475965><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, good.<br>
Tell me about it.
<SYNC Start=1479803><P Class=ENCC>
This is lieutenant Disher.
<SYNC Start=1481249><P Class=ENCC>
I'm in interrogation room D<br>
talking with Jennie Mandeville again.
<SYNC Start=1485998><P Class=ENCC>
So let's start from the beginning.<br>
What was your roommate's name?
<SYNC Start=1490009><P Class=ENCC>
- Toni.<br>
- Toni? Toni what?
<SYNC Start=1492680><P Class=ENCC>
I don't know.
<SYNC Start=1495038><P Class=ENCC>
You don't know.
<SYNC Start=1497125><P Class=ENCC>
- Male or female?<br>
- I think male.
<SYNC Start=1499649><P Class=ENCC>
You're not sure?
<SYNC Start=1501899><P Class=ENCC>
To tell you the truth...
<SYNC Start=1504012><P Class=ENCC>
I just brought him home the day before.
<SYNC Start=1507781><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1508039><P Class=ENCC>
Okay. Um...<br>
let's move on.
<SYNC Start=1511430><P Class=ENCC>
So you came home, you found Toni.
<SYNC Start=1517270><P Class=ENCC>
And you, what, disposed<br>
of the body yourself?
<SYNC Start=1520703><P Class=ENCC>
You realize that's a federal offense.
<SYNC Start=1522407><P Class=ENCC>
I couldn't take it, okay?
<SYNC Start=1524797><P Class=ENCC>
I couldn't just stand there looking at it.
<SYNC Start=1528296><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1529288><P Class=ENCC>
Jennie, what did you do with the body?
<SYNC Start=1532711><P Class=ENCC>
I flushed it down the toilet.
<SYNC Start=1536229><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1540881><P Class=ENCC>
- Was Toni a goldfish?<br>
- A hamster.
<SYNC Start=1544305><P Class=ENCC>
A hamster.
<SYNC Start=1547114><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1548729><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.
<SYNC Start=1549915><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=#D9EFB9>
Gladys, Don't forget to clean<br>
Inside the drawers.
<SYNC Start=1552437><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1555294><P Class=ENCC>
Here's the coroner's report.<br>
Victim's name Danny Chasen.
<SYNC Start=1558546><P Class=ENCC>
It's probably an alias.<br>
Victim was poisoned.
<SYNC Start=1561284><P Class=ENCC>
Somebody spiked his all natural<br>
barley tea with ammonia.
<SYNC Start=1565503><P Class=ENCC>
- Was he part of the heist?<br>
- Looks like it.
<SYNC Start=1568529><P Class=ENCC>
They found some hair samples<br>
in that roll-top desk at the museum.
<SYNC Start=1571532><P Class=ENCC>
- They match the body.<br>
- What about the diamond?
<SYNC Start=1573595><P Class=ENCC>
Still missing in action.<br>
Wasn't on him or in the cabin.
<SYNC Start=1576537><P Class=ENCC>
We know he had a partner.<br>
Somebody who works at the museum.
<SYNC Start=1580239><P Class=ENCC>
- It's probably still with them.<br>
- Wait, wait, wait.
<SYNC Start=1582291><P Class=ENCC>
So the reward is still good, right?<br>
I mean, no one's claimed it.
<SYNC Start=1585819><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, as far as I know,<br>
the offer is still good. / Ka-ching.
<SYNC Start=1590228><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, can you make her stop saying that?
<SYNC Start=1593481><P Class=ENCC>
This is no longer a parlor game.
<SYNC Start=1595189><P Class=ENCC>
A man is dead, this is<br>
a homicide investigation now.
<SYNC Start=1597452><P Class=ENCC>
Which means nobody is to withhold<br>
any information from anybody.
<SYNC Start=1603428><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1604619><P Class=ENCC>
- What, you're looking at me?<br>
- Yes, I am, Ms. Teeger.
<SYNC Start=1607789><P Class=ENCC>
Did you write these?
<SYNC Start=1609458><P Class=ENCC>
Don't deny it, I know it was you!
<SYNC Start=1612655><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1614129><P Class=ENCC>
"How are things down under?<br>
Hint, hint."
<SYNC Start=1617162><P Class=ENCC>
"Monk was right, you should<br>
clean under the table."
<SYNC Start=1619828><P Class=ENCC>
You don't fool me for a second.
<SYNC Start=1622130><P Class=ENCC>
"It goes without saying, don't forget to<br>
throw away these little post-its too."
<SYNC Start=1625552><P Class=ENCC>
Captain, she never cleans<br>
under the tables.
<SYNC Start=1626908><P Class=ENCC>
- You are not the boss of me!<br>
- Well, I think I am the boss of you.
<SYNC Start=1630429><P Class=ENCC>
- What makes you think you're the boss of me?<br>
- If I was the boss of you, you'd be fired!
<SYNC Start=1634356><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1635186><P Class=ENCC>
No, hey!<br>
Hey, separate. Both of you.
<SYNC Start=1637541><P Class=ENCC>
Monk, over there.
<SYNC Start=1639115><P Class=ENCC>
Gladys, can I have<br>
a word with you, please?
<SYNC Start=1641861><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1645073><P Class=ENCC>
Look, Gladys, he's Monk.
<SYNC Start=1649066><P Class=ENCC>
Try to ignore him.
<SYNC Start=1651416><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1653157><P Class=ENCC>
Can you ignore him?
<SYNC Start=1655561><P Class=ENCC>
No, I can't.<br>
Just do the best you can.
<SYNC Start=1660250><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1668628><P Class=ENCC>
- So you're not gonna arrest me?<br>
- No, not this time, miss.
<SYNC Start=1672520><P Class=ENCC>
But listen, the next time<br>
you feel like confessing something,
<SYNC Start=1674993><P Class=ENCC>
you might wanna call a priest.
<SYNC Start=1676636><P Class=ENCC>
Will you escort miss Mandeville out?
<SYNC Start=1678724><P Class=ENCC>
No problem.
<SYNC Start=1680073><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1682616><P Class=ENCC>
- Who's she?<br>
- The looney tune of the month.
<SYNC Start=1685657><P Class=ENCC>
Her name's Jennie Mandeville.
<SYNC Start=1687245><P Class=ENCC>
She keeps coming in here<br>
and confessing to stuff.
<SYNC Start=1689441><P Class=ENCC>
- What was it this time?<br>
- She comes in, same as yesterday.
<SYNC Start=1692548><P Class=ENCC>
Says she accidentally<br>
killed her roommate.
<SYNC Start=1694433><P Class=ENCC>
So I take her into the back room<br>
and I turn on the tape recorder.
<SYNC Start=1697936><P Class=ENCC>
Turns out her roommate was a hamster.
<SYNC Start=1700632><P Class=ENCC>
- She didn't look unstable.<br>
- They never do.
<SYNC Start=1703428><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, can we get back to work now?<br>
Missing diamond, remember?
<SYNC Start=1707062><P Class=ENCC>
Ka-ching.
<SYNC Start=1708322><P Class=ENCC>
Ka-ching.
<SYNC Start=1709775><P Class=ENCC>
She is putting so much pressure on me.
<SYNC Start=1712551><P Class=ENCC>
She's obsessed with this<br>
million-dollar reward. Obsessed.
<SYNC Start=1715977><P Class=ENCC>
All right, well, Adrian,<br>
she's worried about money.
<SYNC Start=1718105><P Class=ENCC>
Now, I know, a lot of people are.
<SYNC Start=1720350><P Class=ENCC>
Not me.<br>
When I was on the force,
<SYNC Start=1722141><P Class=ENCC>
I used to hate cashing my paycheck.<br>
I still do.
<SYNC Start=1725894><P Class=ENCC>
To me, police work is like a higher calling.<br>
Like the priesthood.
<SYNC Start=1730336><P Class=ENCC>
You know, Adrian,<br>
even priests have to get paid.
<SYNC Start=1733373><P Class=ENCC>
But it brings up an interesting question.
<SYNC Start=1736051><P Class=ENCC>
Something I would like to explore with you.
<SYNC Start=1739453><P Class=ENCC>
What would you do<br>
if you had a million dollars?
<SYNC Start=1744672><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1745137><P Class=ENCC>
Well, uh...
<SYNC Start=1747631><P Class=ENCC>
I guess I'd hire you full time.
<SYNC Start=1751547><P Class=ENCC>
And keep you on retainer. 24/7.
<SYNC Start=1754617><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe I'd buy you a house<br>
right next to mine.
<SYNC Start=1757842><P Class=ENCC>
So I could just drop in anytime.
<SYNC Start=1761725><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1762279><P Class=ENCC>
This is fun.<br>
What would you do with a million dollars?
<SYNC Start=1765281><P Class=ENCC>
Buy an island.
<SYNC Start=1767916><P Class=ENCC>
A desert island in...
<SYNC Start=1770961><P Class=ENCC>
the middle of nowhere.
<SYNC Start=1774518><P Class=ENCC>
So we would do our sessions<br>
over the phone?
<SYNC Start=1779214><P Class=ENCC>
Well, see, this island, in my mind...
<SYNC Start=1783773><P Class=ENCC>
no phone service.
<SYNC Start=1786704><P Class=ENCC>
I guess I'd have to buy a boat.
<SYNC Start=1788803><P Class=ENCC>
See, that's funny,<br>
because, the island, in my fantasy...
<SYNC Start=1794060><P Class=ENCC>
no dock.
<SYNC Start=1796353><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1797980><P Class=ENCC>
Well, may the best man win.
<SYNC Start=1801185><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1802234><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me!
<SYNC Start=1804240><P Class=ENCC>
What are you doing?<br>
Did you see that?
<SYNC Start=1806798><P Class=ENCC>
There was someone out there.<br>
I'm going to have to report this.
<SYNC Start=1809105><P Class=ENCC>
It's okay. It's okay.
<SYNC Start=1811104><P Class=ENCC>
He's just another detective<br>
trying to find the diamond.
<SYNC Start=1815526><P Class=ENCC>
There's a whole bunch of them.
<SYNC Start=1817627><P Class=ENCC>
Yesterday, they followed us down the coast<br>
to that big meditation center in Monterey.
<SYNC Start=1822963><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, I've been there.<br>
It's just beautiful.
<SYNC Start=1825868><P Class=ENCC>
But this was years ago<br>
when Jennie Mandeville was still alive.
<SYNC Start=1830757><P Class=ENCC>
- Jennie Mandeville.<br>
- Jennie Mandeville.
<SYNC Start=1834147><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, she owned the property.
<SYNC Start=1836255><P Class=ENCC>
There's this big plaque there<br>
with her name on it.
<SYNC Start=1839976><P Class=ENCC>
That's right.
<SYNC Start=1841731><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1843018><P Class=ENCC>
I remember, I saw it.
<SYNC Start=1846361><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1847462><P Class=ENCC>
What?
<SYNC Start=1849525><P Class=ENCC>
I just solved the case.
<SYNC Start=1852321><P Class=ENCC>
I think I know where that diamond is.
<SYNC Start=1855040><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1855445><P Class=ENCC>
I have to go.<br>
We'll add 20 minutes onto my next session.
<SYNC Start=1858389><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, Adrian! Adrian, I'm sorry.<br>
I have a policy.
<SYNC Start=1860846><P Class=ENCC>
If you leave early, I have to<br>
charge you for the whole session.
<SYNC Start=1864523><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1868467><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.
<SYNC Start=1870416><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1876887><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.<br>
Okay.
<SYNC Start=1880578><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1882190><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.
<SYNC Start=1883865><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1889745><P Class=ENCC>
Natalie!  Natalie, I did it!<br>
I solved the case!
<SYNC Start=1891587><P Class=ENCC>
- I know where the diamond is!<br>
- What? So where is it?
<SYNC Start=1894532><P Class=ENCC>
It's at the police station,<br>
it's been there the whole time!
<SYNC Start=1897066><P Class=ENCC>
It's been right under our nose.
<SYNC Start=1899201><P Class=ENCC>
- Oh, my god.<br>
- Who would do that to my car?
<SYNC Start=1902888><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1904674><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, my god.<br>
Natalie! They're listening.
<SYNC Start=1908707><P Class=ENCC>
What?
<SYNC Start=1910428><P Class=ENCC>
What I meant was,<br>
I didn't solve the case.
<SYNC Start=1913518><P Class=ENCC>
I wish I had, I'm completely stumped.
<SYNC Start=1915423><P Class=ENCC>
- What are you talking about?<br>
- No, wait.
<SYNC Start=1917483><P Class=ENCC>
What I really meant was,<br>
I did solve the case.
<SYNC Start=1919806><P Class=ENCC>
The diamond is in the Philippines.
<SYNC Start=1922365><P Class=ENCC>
We gotta go the airport,<br>
fly to the...
<SYNC Start=1924467><P Class=ENCC>
Forget about it.<br>
Just run! Run!
<SYNC Start=1928142><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1929319><P Class=ENCC>
Monk! Mr. Monk!
<SYNC Start=1932618><P Class=ENCC>
- Mr. Monk!<br>
- My god.
<SYNC Start=1936206><P Class=ENCC>
Hey!
<SYNC Start=1938734><P Class=ENCC>
Talking to you!
<SYNC Start=1940988><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1941488><P Class=ENCC>
Monk, Mr. Monk! Come on!<br>
Talk, little friend.
<SYNC Start=1946847><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1953662><P Class=ENCC>
Here, here, here!
<SYNC Start=1955285><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1958230><P Class=ENCC>
Through the middle alley!
<SYNC Start=1960551><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1966196><P Class=ENCC>
I said, Mr. Monk!
<SYNC Start=1967923><P Class=ENCC>
Slow down!
<SYNC Start=1969966><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1980771><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, stop!
<SYNC Start=1983018><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1987050><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
<SYNC Start=1990098><P Class=ENCC>
1, 2, 3, 4...
<SYNC Start=1994611><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1997725><P Class=ENCC>
- Please, stop.<br>
- Change, you, schmuck!
<SYNC Start=1999581><P Class=ENCC>
Get out of the way!
<SYNC Start=2001609><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2028112><P Class=ENCC>
- Did you see them?<br>
- We lost them.
<SYNC Start=2030359><P Class=ENCC>
Wait.
<SYNC Start=2031636><P Class=ENCC>
We've been following Monk,<br>
we've been watching Monk.
<SYNC Start=2034530><P Class=ENCC>
Why don't we try thinking like monk?
<SYNC Start=2037477><P Class=ENCC>
Think like Monk. Think like Monk.<br>
Think like Monk.
<SYNC Start=2040394><P Class=ENCC>
Think like Monk.<br>
Think like Monk.
<SYNC Start=2044475><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2062451><P Class=ENCC>
- What are you doing?<br>
- He went that way.
<SYNC Start=2065598><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2071192><P Class=ENCC>
I think we lost them.
<SYNC Start=2072338><P Class=ENCC>
You keep saying that,<br>
but we never do.
<SYNC Start=2075607><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, hey, hey.<br>
Taxi! Taxi!
<SYNC Start=2080618><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2080892><P Class=ENCC>
Police headquarters on Vinton street.
<SYNC Start=2083079><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2085007><P Class=ENCC>
- What are you doing, chief?<br>
- I'm with her.
<SYNC Start=2086457><P Class=ENCC>
You gotta ride in the back,<br>
that's the rule.
<SYNC Start=2088196><P Class=ENCC>
No, I prefer to sit up front.<br>
It's one of my things.
<SYNC Start=2090773><P Class=ENCC>
It's true, it's one of his things.
<SYNC Start=2091817><P Class=ENCC>
Well, here's one of my things.<br>
Nobody rides in the front.
<SYNC Start=2094000><P Class=ENCC>
- I'm afraid it's not negotiable.<br>
- Who's negotiating?
<SYNC Start=2096718><P Class=ENCC>
- That's it, I'm out of here.<br>
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait!
<SYNC Start=2099826><P Class=ENCC>
I'll give you 50 bucks<br>
if you let him ride up front.
<SYNC Start=2103038><P Class=ENCC>
- Why? What's he gonna do?<br>
- Nothing, nothing.
<SYNC Start=2105267><P Class=ENCC>
He's got a cluster of<br>
compulsions and phobias
<SYNC Start=2107421><P Class=ENCC>
that manifest themselves<br>
in a variety of, you know...
<SYNC Start=2109843><P Class=ENCC>
it's one of his things.<br>
He has things. / $100.
<SYNC Start=2113381><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2114153><P Class=ENCC>
All right, 72.<br>
That's all I have.
<SYNC Start=2115798><P Class=ENCC>
- Welcome aboard.<br>
- Whoa, whoa, wait.
<SYNC Start=2118402><P Class=ENCC>
This inspection sticker expired yesterday.
<SYNC Start=2120961><P Class=ENCC>
- Yeah, I'm taking care of that tomorrow.<br>
- Expired. It's expired.
<SYNC Start=2124918><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Monk, it's a million dollars.<br>
Please get in the cab for me.
<SYNC Start=2129612><P Class=ENCC>
It's expired.
<SYNC Start=2131440><P Class=ENCC>
Forget about it, forget about it.<br>
Give me back my money.
<SYNC Start=2133499><P Class=ENCC>
No refunds.<br>
It's one of my things.
<SYNC Start=2136653><P Class=ENCC>
Monk!<br>
Hey, Mr. Monk, Mr. Monk!
<SYNC Start=2139207><P Class=ENCC>
Can we, uh, can we be soft<br>
chumming up here?
<SYNC Start=2142667><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2143223><P Class=ENCC>
Monk!
<SYNC Start=2145354><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2148898><P Class=ENCC>
Where's...
<SYNC Start=2150257><P Class=ENCC>
Where's...
<SYNC Start=2151888><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2152280><P Class=ENCC>
where's...
<SYNC Start=2153817><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2156199><P Class=ENCC>
- Oh, Disher.<br>
- Yeah, yeah.
<SYNC Start=2157551><P Class=ENCC>
I think he's in the observation room.
<SYNC Start=2160183><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2161727><P Class=ENCC>
Gladys, we're being followed.<br>
Don't tell anybody you saw us.
<SYNC Start=2166713><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2170026><P Class=ENCC>
- They locked the door!<br>
- It says "push." / Get out of the way!
<SYNC Start=2173784><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2180406><P Class=ENCC>
That way.
<SYNC Start=2182050><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2183159><P Class=ENCC>
Lieutenant! Lieutenant, remember the<br>
security guard that you arrested? / Yeah.
<SYNC Start=2186938><P Class=ENCC>
- Where did you interrogate him?<br>
- Right there, room B.
<SYNC Start=2189966><P Class=ENCC>
And the girl who kept confessing,<br>
Jennie Mandeville,
<SYNC Start=2192174><P Class=ENCC>
- where did you take her?<br>
- Room A then room D.
<SYNC Start=2194555><P Class=ENCC>
- But she was never in there?<br>
- No, no.
<SYNC Start=2196475><P Class=ENCC>
It's gotta still be in there.<br>
In that room! 
<SYNC Start=2197880><P Class=ENCC>
What's in there?<br>
Monk, what's going on?
<SYNC Start=2199288><P Class=ENCC>
Tell you later. / Whoa, whoa, whoa,<br>
you cannot come in here.
<SYNC Start=2202365><P Class=ENCC>
My two friends are American citizens.<br>
They have a right to be here.
<SYNC Start=2205235><P Class=ENCC>
Myself, I am on a temporary visa.
<SYNC Start=2207453><P Class=ENCC>
- Which I hope to extend.<br>
- Are they with you?
<SYNC Start=2209562><P Class=ENCC>
Only in the strictest,<br>
most terrible sense of the word.
<SYNC Start=2212189><P Class=ENCC>
I heard you tell your shrink<br>
you solved the case.
<SYNC Start=2214244><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me.
<SYNC Start=2215650><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2217388><P Class=ENCC>
Nobody's going anywhere.
<SYNC Start=2219111><P Class=ENCC>
Not until we know what he knows.
<SYNC Start=2221758><P Class=ENCC>
You just made a big mistake, my friend.<br>
I happen to be a police captain.
<SYNC Start=2225074><P Class=ENCC>
And this is an unlawful imprisonment.<br>
Book him.
<SYNC Start=2228252><P Class=ENCC>
You're under arrest. Turn around.
<SYNC Start=2231458><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2233972><P Class=ENCC>
Fine, give me your hands.
<SYNC Start=2237148><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2237782><P Class=ENCC>
- Do you have your cuffs?<br>
- In my office.
<SYNC Start=2241330><P Class=ENCC>
It's in there, isn't it?
<SYNC Start=2243738><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2244137><P Class=ENCC>
The diamond is in that very room.
<SYNC Start=2246700><P Class=ENCC>
- What?<br>
- It is?
<SYNC Start=2248860><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2252754><P Class=ENCC>
Shut up!<br>
Everybody, shut up!
<SYNC Start=2256314><P Class=ENCC>
Everybody but Monk.
<SYNC Start=2258702><P Class=ENCC>
- Monk, what's going on?<br>
- Okay.
<SYNC Start=2261837><P Class=ENCC>
Here's what happened.
<SYNC Start=2263180><P Class=ENCC>
The woman who founded the meditation center<br>
was named Jennie Mandeville.
<SYNC Start=2266551><P Class=ENCC>
- What, the confessor?<br>
- No, no, no, no.
<SYNC Start=2267912><P Class=ENCC>
The girl you met was<br>
not the real Jennie Mandeville.
<SYNC Start=2271027><P Class=ENCC>
She got the name from a plaque<br>
she saw up at the retreat.
<SYNC Start=2275142><P Class=ENCC>
She needed a fake name,<br>
maybe she liked the sound of it.
<SYNC Start=2277550><P Class=ENCC>
- What was she doing up there?<br>
- She went there to kill Danny Chasen.
<SYNC Start=2281439><P Class=ENCC>
The guy in the roll-top desk.
<SYNC Start=2284330><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2284683><P Class=ENCC>
It was probably her boyfriend's idea.
<SYNC Start=2287262><P Class=ENCC>
Jewel thieves are like children.<br>
They hate to share.
<SYNC Start=2292525><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2294019><P Class=ENCC>
This is a very crowded room.
<SYNC Start=2296133><P Class=ENCC>
This is a very, very, very, very,<br>
very, very...
<SYNC Start=2299110><P Class=ENCC>
Monk, Monk, Monk, it's okay.<br>
It's okay.
<SYNC Start=2300900><P Class=ENCC>
Who was her boyfriend? / He was<br>
the security guard that Randy arrested.
<SYNC Start=2304994><P Class=ENCC>
He was the jewel thief!<br>
He was the inside man.
<SYNC Start=2307741><P Class=ENCC>
The diamond was still in his pocket<br>
when you were talking to him.
<SYNC Start=2310878><P Class=ENCC>
That's right, we brought him here<br>
right from the museum.
<SYNC Start=2313401><P Class=ENCC>
I remember before the interrogation<br>
he was chewing a big piece of gum.
<SYNC Start=2317729><P Class=ENCC>
But when I saw him after the interrogation,<br>
the gum was gone.
<SYNC Start=2321383><P Class=ENCC>
He must be panicked in that room.
<SYNC Start=2322952><P Class=ENCC>
You had him on the drug charges,<br>
he knew he was about to be arrested.
<SYNC Start=2326144><P Class=ENCC>
Which, of course, meant he'd be searched.
<SYNC Start=2327889><P Class=ENCC>
So he hid the rock right there<br>
under the table.
<SYNC Start=2331018><P Class=ENCC>
With his chewing gum.
<SYNC Start=2332581><P Class=ENCC>
People do it in restaurants all the time.
<SYNC Start=2334374><P Class=ENCC>
I've written letters to my congressman<br>
and to the editor. What can I do?
<SYNC Start=2337885><P Class=ENCC>
He must have telephoned<br>
his girlfriend from jail 
<SYNC Start=2339991><P Class=ENCC>
to tell her where he stashed the diamond.
<SYNC Start=2341592><P Class=ENCC>
And that's why she was coming in here<br>
confessing to everything.
<SYNC Start=2344112><P Class=ENCC>
And why she was always<br>
asking to switch rooms,
<SYNC Start=2346116><P Class=ENCC>
- 'cause she was trying to get in there.<br>
- All right, okay. I changed my mind.
<SYNC Start=2349919><P Class=ENCC>
There's seven of us and we're all adults.<br>
We'll just divide the money seven ways.
<SYNC Start=2354874><P Class=ENCC>
No way.<br>
We were here first.
<SYNC Start=2356711><P Class=ENCC>
I think it's only fair<br>
that we divide the proceeds.
<SYNC Start=2358586><P Class=ENCC>
I mean, we have been working in tandem.
<SYNC Start=2360216><P Class=ENCC>
We've not been working in tandem.<br>
You've been chasing us. That's not tandem.
<SYNC Start=2363036><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me, could I say one thing?
<SYNC Start=2364607><P Class=ENCC>
You and you and you...<br>
you're breathing my air.
<SYNC Start=2369304><P Class=ENCC>
What about them? / They're breathing<br>
your air. You're breathing his.
<SYNC Start=2372559><P Class=ENCC>
It's complicated.<br>
But if these two dropped back...
<SYNC Start=2376226><P Class=ENCC>
Monk, Monk, it's okay.<br>
I'll call for help.
<SYNC Start=2378194><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.
<SYNC Start=2379773><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, my god. Gladys.
<SYNC Start=2382097><P Class=ENCC>
No, no, no, no.<br>
Stop, stop.
<SYNC Start=2386884><P Class=ENCC>
Monk?
<SYNC Start=2388392><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2389157><P Class=ENCC>
Is that you?
<SYNC Start=2391173><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2395620><P Class=ENCC>
I told you to leave me alone.
<SYNC Start=2399057><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2399552><P Class=ENCC>
Somebody barfed in the bathroom!
<SYNC Start=2401645><P Class=ENCC>
No, come on!
<SYNC Start=2403576><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2410655><P Class=ENCC>
Hey!
<SYNC Start=2411995><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2413429><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, fine! Look,
<SYNC Start=2415472><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2416047><P Class=ENCC>
I'm gonna clean under the table<br>
just like you want, okay?
<SYNC Start=2420404><P Class=ENCC>
Go over!<br>
Go over the table and clean!
<SYNC Start=2423033><P Class=ENCC>
- Go over the table and clean!<br>
<font color=lightblue>- Okay? You happy?
<SYNC Start=2425147><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2435204><P Class=ENCC>
I can't look.
<SYNC Start=2436718><P Class=ENCC>
Ka-ching.
<SYNC Start=2439686><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2456263><P Class=ENCC>
She came in again late last night.<br>
Said she had something to confess to.
<SYNC Start=2459976><P Class=ENCC>
- This time we got a real confession.<br>
- Okay, listen to this.
<SYNC Start=2463071><P Class=ENCC>
"Gladys Winchim, who was employed by<br>
a local cleaning service for the last 22 years,"
<SYNC Start=2467916><P Class=ENCC>
"will be flown to London on a private jet<br>
to pick up her reward."
<SYNC Start=2472456><P Class=ENCC>
"Miss Winchim found the stolen gem<br>
while cleaning under a table<br>
in an interrogation room."
<SYNC Start=2477648><P Class=ENCC>
- Are you blaming me?<br>
- Under a table!
<SYNC Start=2480191><P Class=ENCC>
Why do they even want it back?<br>
there's gum all over it.
<SYNC Start=2482959><P Class=ENCC>
I've got some good news,<br>
sort of consolation prize.
<SYNC Start=2485447><P Class=ENCC>
I talk to the commissioner.
<SYNC Start=2487616><P Class=ENCC>
- He's gonna put you under contract.<br>
- Really?
<SYNC Start=2490147><P Class=ENCC>
Put you on retainer.
<SYNC Start=2492185><P Class=ENCC>
He has guaranteed you 16 homicides<br>
a year for next two years.
<SYNC Start=2497803><P Class=ENCC>
16 a year. What, what happen,<br>
what about after that?
<SYNC Start=2501286><P Class=ENCC>
Well...<br>
let's take one year at a time.
<SYNC Start=2504855><P Class=ENCC>
We'll see.
