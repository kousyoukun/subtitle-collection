1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,493
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>if you'll follow me,</i>

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:08,029
<i>I think you're going to find</i>
<i>this next room very interesting.</i>

3
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,201
<i>You're going to want</i>
<i>to get your cameras ready.</i>

4
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:14,042
<i>This is the world-famous</i>
<i>Cromwell family exhibit.</i>

5
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:17,641
<i>I still get goose bumps</i>
<i>every time I walk into this room.</i>

6
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:19,708
It is the largest
private collection in Europe.

7
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:24,883
The Cromwell family has collected
everything from furniture and paintings
to medieval weaponry.

8
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:30,089
This, of course,
is the crown jewel of the exhibit-
no pun intended-

9
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,960
the Alexander diamond.

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,468
It was worn by Queen Elizabeth
at her coronation.

11
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:40,063
- <i>Experts have called it</i>
<i>the most perfect diamond in the world.</i>
- It's beautiful.

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,438
<i>You're probably wondering</i>
<i>what it's worth.</i>

13
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,706
Actually, no one knows.
But I can tell you this:

14
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:51,479
That little rock has been
insured by Lloyd's of London
for $20 million.

15
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:35,470
That's 42.80.
Okay.
There we go.

16
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,483
And I have a coupon.

17
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,621
I can't take this.
It expired yesterday.

18
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:46,250
Yesterday?
Oh, she's right.

19
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:51,127
Darn. Sometimes
I wish I had a time machine.
Wait.

20
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:56,328
If you had a time machine, you would use it
to go back to save 50 cents on Lysol?
Yes. Yes, I would.

21
00:03:56,402 --> 00:04:00,566
You wouldn't use it to save Abraham Lincoln?
Fine. I'll save Lincoln.
It never ends with you.

22
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,507
Sir, do you have a different card?
It says "declined."

23
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:08,536
Declined?
Okay, Mr. Monk, do you have
any money in the bank?

24
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:13,552
No.
That could be it.
Okay. Um-

25
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,088
I'm sorry.
Please hurry.

26
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:20,421
All right, I've got... $34.

27
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,519
Is that it?
Yesterday was payday.

28
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,621
Yes, it was,
but I didn't get paid.

29
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,428
You know, your paydays
are becoming sort of theoretical.

30
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:32,494
Come on.
You need to put some stuff back.
No. I can't.

31
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:37,635
Look- Look. I-I-
I made a list.
Everything here is on the list.

32
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,578
I know. I know.
We're gonna come back later and pick it up.
Come on. People are waitin'.

33
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,775
Okay.
Come on.

34
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:49,550
Oh, this then.
Oh, wait. No.
Um, I need this.

35
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,614
Oh, this-
Ooh. Gotta have the spray.

36
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:56,651
All right. How about-
How about one of these.
Yeah. This one.

37
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,062
Okay.
No. No.
Um, nah, let's go with that one.

38
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,623
All right.
Ah, wait a second.

39
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,726
<i>Come on. Hurry up.</i>

40
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:08,069
Oh, it's like <i>Sophie's Choice</i>,
except it's soup.

41
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,669
Okay, we're keepin' the soup.
We'll put back this, this-

42
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,679
No.
this and this.

43
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:17,682
Mr. Monk, look at us.
This is ridiculous. We're both broke.

44
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,913
We haven't had a new case
in three weeks.
What do you want me to do?

45
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,514
You need to get a raise.
You gotta talk to the captain.
We can't go on like this.

46
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:30,051
I'm not good at this,
asking for more money-
Okay, then let me do the talking.

47
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,657
I'm not good at that either.
Okay, Mr. Monk,
you deserve a raise.

48
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:38,761
You've solved a lot of big cases
for them, single-handedly.
Maybe I helped a little.

49
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,330
No, no, no, no, no!
You can't think like that.
You gotta brag about yourself.

50
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,172
You gotta toot your own horn.
I'm not much of a tooter.

51
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,712
<i>You better learn how to toot.</i>
<i>Toot's a funny word.</i>

52
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,476
Hilarious.
Yeah. Oh, hello, Gladys.

53
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,484
- Natalie Teeger, this is Gladys.
- <i>Hey, Gladys.</i>

54
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:56,318
Gladys is great.
Gladys has been cleaning up
around here for years.

55
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:01,383
I used to help her out in my spare time.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Remember?

56
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:05,192
Yeah, until I got
that restraining order,
remember?

57
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:08,358
Good times,
good times.

58
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:13,963
You have to get underneath, right?
Gladys? Under?
Why? Nobody ever looks under there.

59
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,999
But <i>you'll</i> know it's clean.
Isn't that its own reward?
<i>You'll</i> know.

60
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:21,137
The captain says
I don't have to talk to you.
I know, I know.

61
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,409
But under, okay?
Under the table.

62
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:27,112
I wanna help you guys, okay? I really do.
But they already questioned me four times.

63
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,984
<i>It's not just you, Mr. Landis.</i>
<i>We're talkin' to all the guards,</i>

64
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,889
<i>the cleaning staff, curators-</i>
<i>anybody who was at the museum.</i>

65
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,486
Yeah, but I haven't even been home yet.
And I appreciate that.

66
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,928
We need your official statement,
then you're free to go.

67
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,263
So, for the record,
where were you during the robbery?
For the fifth time, okay?

68
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:47,238
I was at my station
on the main floor. I never left.
I didn't even go to the bathroom.

69
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:52,107
And you didn't hear
anything unusual?
No sir. I-I was three floors away.

70
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,738
Okay.
Excuse me for a second.

71
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,146
Uh, can I get you somethin' to drink?
No.

72
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,554
Monk.
Nat.
What's goin' on?

73
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:07,321
What, you haven't heard?
Robbery at the MacMillan Museum.
It was big, big.

74
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,657
<i>The Alexander diamond.</i>
Whoa!

75
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:14,428
I know, "whoa." Uh, Robbery Division
asked us to help out, so we're takin'
statements from everybody on-site.

76
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,459
- So you're not arresting him
about the drugs?
- Uh, no. What drugs?

77
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:22,372
His fingertips are stained.
Looks like red phosphorous.

78
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:27,402
You get that from making crystal meth.
He's gotta have a lab somewhere.

79
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,846
Okay. I'll check out.

80
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,818
Excuse me, uh, Mr. Landis?
Could you come here, please?

81
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:37,151
If, uh, the captain needs me,
I'll be in Interrogation Room "B."

82
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,214
Uh, right this way.

83
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:46,589
What?
You know what.
You just solved that case for free.

84
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:50,534
Wh-What was I supposed to do?
Well, if you were selling ice cream,
would you hand out free scoops?

85
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,628
Wh-What was I supposed to say?

86
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:56,641
"Hey Lieutenant, there's a drug dealer
somewhere in this room.
I'll tell you who it is for $20"?

87
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,234
At least we'd have $20.

88
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,839
<i>All right, there's the captain.</i>
<i>Remember, you deserve a raise.</i>
<i>You deserve it!</i>

89
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,850
Okay. When you're right,
you're right.
Okay. Captain? Uh-

90
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,547
- Hey, Monk. What are you doing here?
- Captain, I have to talk to you
about something.

91
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:13,319
Can it wait?
Okay, well, we'll come back.

92
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,326
Okay, we're back.

93
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,926
And- Natalie?

94
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,526
- Captain-
- If this is about money,
forget about it.

95
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:29,064
We're broke.
The department is strapped.
We just, uh, got another hiring freeze.

96
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:32,804
- Captain, we haven't had
a new case in three weeks.
- You know, you're right.

97
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,439
There hasn't been
a major homicide in a long time.

98
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,246
- But you gotta keep
your hopes up, stay optimistic.
- Okay. Well, thank you very much.

99
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:42,151
Okay, Captain, come on.
We can't just sit around waitin'
for the phone to ring.

100
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,621
It's not fair to us.
We have no security.

101
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,420
- What do you want me to do?
- We wanna be put on retainer.

102
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:51,953
- What?
- You know- retainer, like a lawyer.
We want a guaranteed income.

103
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:56,365
Look, it doesn't have to be much.
We just need a little security.
Yeah, just-

104
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:03,200
Okay, I'll see what I can do,
but don't get your hopes up, okay?
Anything else?

105
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,403
Um-

106
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:10,381
- It's- It's about Gladys.
- Have you been talking to Gladys?

107
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,383
Captain-
I told you not to talk to Gladys.

108
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,817
She's not cleaning
under the tables again.

109
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,496
I think you should talk to her.
I will- about her aim.

110
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,898
Get him downstairs.

111
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,411
You were right.

112
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:44,472
I get this guy in the room.
He's denying everything.
He's twitching. He's nervous.

113
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,018
Threatened to get a search warrant
and tear his house apart.

114
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,987
I pick up the phone.
I start to dial.
He collapses.

115
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,321
He gave it all up.
Crystal meth lab in his basement.

116
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:56,828
Narcotics is on their way over.
I owe you one.
Okay.

117
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,296
What?

118
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:04,803
You know what.
Oh. Oh, the thing...
about the ice cream and the free scoops?

119
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,861
That's right.

120
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,177
Mr. Monk?

121
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,839
We're rich.
We hit the jackpot.
Oh, good.

122
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,849
Look.
It's about the Alexander diamond.

123
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:21,512
Lloyd's of London is offering
a one million dollar reward
to anybody that finds it.

124
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,522
No questions asked.
So?

125
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,720
Mr. Monk,
you can find that diamond.
Nah, I don't think so.

126
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,819
What?
You're a great detective.

127
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:34,559
You solve crimes all the time
without even trying. It's annoying
how many crimes you solve.

128
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,434
Come on.
Let's go for it.
Let's cash in!

129
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:42,941
Natalie,
I don't do what I do
for money.

130
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:48,641
<i>Mr. Monk, it's a million dollars.</i>
<i>You'll never have to worry</i>
<i>for the rest of your life.</i>

131
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:52,047
Well, of course <i>you'll</i> worry,
but not about money.

132
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,987
I don't know.
Mr. Monk, you have to do this.

133
00:10:57,056 --> 00:11:02,790
I mean, I love this job,
but I have to get paid.
Just-Just please!

134
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,991
Just say yes.
Say you'll do it.
Just say yes.

135
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,001
Could you get off my counter?

136
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,597
Okay, fine.
I'll do it.

137
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,772
Congratulations.

138
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,605
Excuse me.
Any suspects yet?

139
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,275
I wouldn't know.
I'm just delivering flowers.

140
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,650
No, you're not.
You're a private detective, just like me-
Well, not quite like me.

141
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,020
Me, a detective?

142
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:09,289
That's, uh, pretty funny, actually.
I can't wait to tell the guys back at-
Look, you're insulting me.

143
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,091
Triple-A-Flower Shop.
That satellite dish on your roof,
the number,

144
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:15,224
555-obviously a fake-

145
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:19,135
No. Conclusion number one-
you're after the Alexander diamond.

146
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,935
<i>Conclusion number two-</i>
<i>you haven't got a prayer.</i>

147
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:26,406
Scuse me,
that's a handicapped spot.

148
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,312
It's okay. I'm psychotic.

149
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:32,077
- Is this where they stole the rock?
- Are you addressing me?

150
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,745
Not anymore.
You, Poindexter-

151
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:40,349
This the scene of the crime?
Excuse me, boys- I got a million dollars
waitin' for me inside.

152
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,183
Ah, apparently we think alike.

153
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,690
Frightening thought
for those of us who aren't you.

154
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:16,626
Uh, "Philip Wick.
Access to all areas." This'll do me.

155
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,892
Hello again.

156
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:25,498
What does this say?
"Curator Sally Kant."

157
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:29,063
Here, try this one:
"Robert Gant."
That's a boy's name.

158
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:34,135
Uh, look, chaps. Um, since
we're all after the same thing,
why don't we just pool our talents?

159
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:38,650
- What are you talkin' about?
- Well, work together and split the reward.

160
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,981
Look, why don't we begin
by introducing ourselves, right?

161
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:44,489
My name's St. Clare,
retired Scotland Yard inspector.

162
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,151
<i>I moved to San Francisco-</i>
Whoa, I'm interruptin' ya.

163
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:51,822
No friggin' way.
I'm findin' that rock myself,
and I'm keepin' all the money.

164
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:55,230
Well, may the best man win.
I intend to.

165
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,235
He said "man."

166
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:04,434
<i>This entire wing was locked.</i>
<i>I mean, it was completely locked down.</i>

167
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,243
Somehow they opened
that connecting door from the inside.
We can't figure it out.

168
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,443
What do you think?
I don't know yet.

169
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,749
Well, come on. Focus. Concentrate.
Do that thing you do.

170
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:19,188
I've never seen you like this.
What, broke?

171
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,697
Ah.
What?
What, what, what?

172
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:30,292
These scratches here and here-

173
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:36,273
Looks like these tire irons
weren't heavy enough
to do the job-

174
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:40,676
Gentlemen, we have competition.
That is Adrian Monk.

175
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:44,648
- Adrian Monk?
I thought he worked homicide.
- <i>Oh, what are you two afraid of?</i>

176
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,245
Something's off here.
What is it?

177
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,256
Glass shards on the inside.

178
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:04,633
When that case was shattered,
this case was open.

179
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:09,663
I think they took this weapon,
used it, then put it back
and relocked the case.

180
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,075
Wha-What does that tell us?
A lot.

181
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:17,809
It means it was an inside job,
and they didn't want us to know
it was an inside job.

182
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:21,148
Ka-ching!
What does that mean?

183
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,280
It means we're gonna be rich.
Ka-ching!

184
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,551
This guy's good.

185
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,559
What's he saying?

186
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,460
Put that thing away.
What's wrong with you?

187
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:37,469
Excuse me, sir.
Did anything unusual happen Tuesday,
before the break-in?

188
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,697
Anything at all
out of the ordinary?

189
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,706
No.

190
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:47,212
Well, now that you mention it,
Tuesday afternoon I heard- or I thought
I heard- somebody whispering.

191
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,342
Whispering.
It wasn't in this room.
It was, uh, down the hallway.

192
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:56,013
It was about 2:30.
I was standing about there,

193
00:15:56,088 --> 00:16:00,252
and I thought I heard
someone saying "my womb."

194
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,260
My room?
"My womb."

195
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:05,855
It was a man's voice,
and he was saying it over and over.
My womb.

196
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:09,492
I thought it was coming
from that vent, but it's impossible.

197
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,661
I think I'm... going senile.

198
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,898
I'm sorry.
I've got to take this.

199
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,907
Hello?
My womb.

200
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,967
My womb.
It sounds like a mantra,
like a meditation.

201
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:22,536
My womb. My womb.
My womb.

202
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,081
<i>My-</i>

203
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,429
<i>Look at this.</i>
<i>What?</i>

204
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,057
It's a footprint.

205
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:45,160
Somebody was hiding in here.

206
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:51,107
Wait. In there?
That's how they opened
the connecting door.

207
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,339
Let's grab the detectives.
We need an evidence kit.
Wait. Not yet.

208
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,473
What do you mean, not yet?
Let's find the diamond,
then we'll tell 'em how we did it.

209
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:02,953
Natalie, this is not a game show.
This- this is a felony.
Investi-

210
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:13,121
It's a broken necklace.
That's an unusual design.

211
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:17,225
<i>Oh, good.</i>
<i>We'll try and I.D. it.</i>
<i>Come on. Let's get outta here.</i>

212
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,269
- Oh.
- Sorry.

213
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:27,575
You okay?
Oh, I don't know.

214
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,978
Something's-
Something's wrong. I-
What?

215
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,949
<i>I'm a little-a little-</i>

216
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,508
I'm not balanced.

217
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:43,491
<i>Um, excuse me. Yeah, um,</i>
<i>I'm gonna be needing that back...</i>

218
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,861
because I only have two of them,
and the other one doesn't work.

219
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,298
Are you following us?
What?

220
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:53,668
Ah, Mr. Monk, what an honor.
My name's St. Clare-
Inspector St. Clare.

221
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,503
I've been following your cases assiduously
from across the pond, you know.

222
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,135
<i>Hey, Shakespeare, nobody cares.</i>

223
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,805
- Wait. I can't believe
you're following us.
- Is that a lead?

224
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,713
Maybe.
Uh-

225
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:09,686
Look. Mr. St. Clare- Inspector,
I'm sure a gentleman like yourself
can appreciate the fact...

226
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,485
that these two leads belong to us.

227
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:17,586
- Two leads?
- Well, yes, the necklace
and the initials carved in the desk.

228
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,063
Mr. Monk.
I'm sorry.

229
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,357
Go. Go. Go. Go.

230
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:33,076
Excuse me.
My name is Jennie Mandeville,

231
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:37,878
and, uh-
I did something I'd like to confess.

232
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,781
Well, what did ya do, Jennie?

233
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,547
I robbed a bank.

234
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,721
It was about three weeks ago-
the Community Savings Trust
in Sausalito.

235
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,960
Sausalito?
I don't remember
anything about that.

236
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:58,628
I'll take it.
Hi, I'm Lieutenant Disher.

237
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,605
Uh, Jennie?
Uh, Miss Mandeville.

238
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,314
Just, uh, have a seat.

239
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:21,221
- Uh, is there a problem?
- I'm claustrophobic.
Is this the only room that you have?

240
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:26,287
All the rooms are the same size, miss.
Please, just have a seat.

241
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:33,603
This is Lieutenant Disher.
I'm in Interrogation Room "A"
with Jennie Mandeville.

242
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,267
So, you say you robbed a bank?

243
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,867
That's right.

244
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:43,244
I went inside, and...

245
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:47,945
I saw one of those pens-
you know- chained to the desk?

246
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,352
And I really needed a pen,

247
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:55,291
so... I snapped it off,
and I put it in my purse.

248
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,453
You stole a pen?

249
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,794
One pen?

250
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,100
Oh, God.
Do you think God will forgive me?

251
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,106
I don't know, ma'am-

252
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:12,143
but we do.

253
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,202
You're free to go.

254
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,724
God, what is up with those three detectives?
Do you think we lost them?
Ah, Natalie, they are not detectives.

255
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:30,853
They're rent-a-cops. They're hired guns.
They are mercenaries.

256
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:34,763
In other words, they're us.
This whole thing is about greed.

257
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,826
Okay, you know how you always say
you'll thank me later? You'll thank me later.
Ooh, that's gotta be him.

258
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,896
<i>Hello, are you Mr. Kwan?</i>

259
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,347
I think he nodded. Was that-
Was that a-Was that a nod?

260
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,076
Sir? Sir, could-

261
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,919
If that was a nod, nod.

262
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,516
Sir, we found this
at the scene of a crime-
a robbery.

263
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,584
We've been doing some research.
This is your design, isn't it?

264
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:06,096
You give these to your students?
Natalie, please.

265
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:10,999
Sir, you-you, uh-you have a thread
hanging, uh, right in the middle, there.

266
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,094
I'll just- I'll get it.
Just one lone-

267
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,036
Um-
If you just-
<i>Okay.</i>

268
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,975
Okay. Mr. Kwan,
you look like a very busy man,
so I'm just gonna get right to the point.

269
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,036
Do you have a student that could fit
inside of a rolltop desk?

270
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:26,210
He can't be more than five feet tall.
Does that ring a bell... or a gong?

271
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,652
Mr. Monk,
you're distracting him.
No. He's distracting me.

272
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:33,452
Is there anyone here who is
that small and limber-who could
scrunch up inside of a desk?

273
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,459
A scruncher-
a little scruncher?

274
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,961
- Mr. Kwan, there's a lot of money
at stake here.
- Got it.

275
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,225
<i>Well, well, well. Mr. Monk.</i>

276
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:44,235
We meet again. Surprised?

277
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:48,797
- Why don't you get your own clues?
- Well, normally I do,
but you two are so easy to follow,

278
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:52,241
<i>especially when you're kind enough</i>
<i>to keep your emergency blinker on</i>
<i>all day long.</i>

279
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,007
I told you.
It's the safest way to drive.

280
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,277
<i>Wait! Don't question anybody yet.</i>

281
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:04,220
- I have a voice stress analyzer.
I'll be able to tell if he's lying or not.
- He hasn't said anything.

282
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:09,249
- You are a pathetic little frog, aren't you?
- You thought you could lose me, huh?
Well, you can all just relax.

283
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:14,231
Dirk'll take it from here.
Hey, hippie, you in charge?

284
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:18,929
<i>My name is Dirk. I'm a professional</i>
<i>bounty hunter. I was wondering</i>
<i>if I could have a word with you?</i>

285
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,201
- <i>Maybe this'll change your mind.</i>
<i>I got $200 here.</i>
- Two hundred dollars?

286
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:26,335
- They do use money on you planet, don't they?
- <i>I don't have any money</i>
<i>on me at the moment, um-</i>

287
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,253
- Cabin 14!
- It doesn't say that.

288
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,311
You're good.

289
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,858
Haven't worked out a day in my life.
You know why? Security cameras.
225.

290
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:46,125
His name is Chasen.
He's over at Cabin 14.

291
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:55,837
<i>Come on. There he is. Let's go!</i>
Hey, slow down!

292
00:22:57,008 --> 00:23:00,774
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Mr. Monk,</i>
<i>what are you doing?</i>

293
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,679
I say, Mr. Monk!
Don't let him get away!

294
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,309
We got him!
Mr. Monk!

295
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:10,246
Get back here!
Gotta go to the gym.

296
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,256
Excuse me.

297
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,258
Excuse me.
Get outta my way!

298
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,988
Hello, Mr. Chasen!

299
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,860
Hi. Is this your necklace?
We found it in a museum.

300
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:24,061
Okay! Where's the diamond?
Hey! Hey, I'm talkin' to you!

301
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,168
Wow, that's a really deep trance.

302
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,911
Couldn't be deeper.

303
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,177
This man's dead.

304
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,125
Welcome back, Miss Mandeville.
Have a seat.

305
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,188
You know the drill.

306
00:23:56,435 --> 00:24:00,337
I don't like this room.
Please, Miss Mandeville.

307
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:03,499
You said you had
something important to tell me-
something about a dead body.

308
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:09,411
And you said
you didn't wanna talk in my office.
I told you I'm claustrophobic.

309
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:14,544
What about another room?
All our interrogation rooms
are the same size, unfortunately:

310
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,553
no wet bars, no Jacuzzis-

311
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,613
Please, just have a seat.

312
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:25,220
Now, you said you found a body-
your roommate's body.

313
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:31,665
This, um-
This is a real thing, right?

314
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:37,504
Not like, uh, stealin' the pen
from the bank?
Okay, good.

315
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,874
Tell me about it.

316
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,675
This is, uh, Lieutenant Disher.
I'm in Interrogation Room "D"...

317
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,875
talking with Jennie Mandeville...
again.

318
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:51,048
So, let's start from the beginning.
What was your roommate's name?
Tony.

319
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,989
Tony?
Tony what?
I don't know.

320
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:58,026
You don't know.
Male or female?

321
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,587
I think male.
You're not sure?

322
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,936
To tell you the truth,
I just brought him home
the day before.

323
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:13,974
Okay, um, let's move on.
So, um, you came home.

324
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:19,278
You found Tony, and you-what,
disposed of the body yourself?

325
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:24,779
<i>You realize that's a federal offense?</i>
I couldn't take it, okay?

326
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,848
I couldn't just stand there looking at it.

327
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,955
Jennie, what did you do with the body?

328
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,555
I flushed it down the toilet.

329
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:44,100
- Was Tony a goldfish?
- A hamster.

330
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,075
A hamster.

331
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,412
Okay.

332
00:25:55,287 --> 00:26:00,088
Here's the coroner's report.
Victim's name: Danny Chasen.
It's probably an alias.

333
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:05,562
Victim was poisoned.
Somebody spiked his all-natural
barley tea with ammonia.

334
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,497
Was he... part of the heist?
Looks like it.

335
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:12,469
They found some hair samples
in that rolltop desk at the museum.
They match the body.

336
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:16,735
Okay, what about the diamond?
Still missing in action.
It wasn't on him or in the cabin.

337
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:21,472
We know he had a partner-
somebody who works at the museum.
It's probably still with him.

338
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:25,243
Uh, w-wait, wait.
So, the reward's still good, right?
I mean no one's claimed it.

339
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,684
Yes. As far as I know,
the offer is still good.

340
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,655
Ka-ching.
Can you make her stop saying that?

341
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:38,355
This is no longer a parlor game. A man is dead.
This is a homicide investigation now,
which means...

342
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:43,026
nobody is to withhold
any information
from anybody.

343
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:47,569
What?
You're lookin' at me?
Yes, I am, Miss Teeger.

344
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:52,133
<i>Did you write these?</i>
<i>Don't deny it. I know it was you!</i>

345
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,703
"How are things down under?
Hint, hint."

346
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:01,946
"Monk was right.
You should clean under the table."
You don't fool me for a second.

347
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,547
"It goes without saying-
don't forget to throw away
these little Post-its too."

348
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:09,116
Captain, she never cleans
under the table.
You are not the boss of me!

349
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,526
I think I am.
What makes you think
you're the boss of me?

350
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:13,530
If I was the boss of you,
you'd be fired!

351
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,532
Why do you think-
Whoa!
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! No!

352
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,038
Hey, separate, both of you.
Monk, over there.
Gladys, can I have a word with you, please?

353
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:30,877
Look.
Gladys, he's Monk.
Try to ignore him.

354
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,050
Can you ignore him?

355
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,750
No, I can't.
Just do the best you can.

356
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,827
So you're not gonna arrest me?
No, not this time, miss.

357
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:56,271
But next time you feel
like confessing something,
you might wanna call a priest.

358
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,606
Will you, uh, escort
Miss Mandeville out?
No problem.

359
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,215
Who's she?
Loony tune of the month.

360
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:09,447
Her name's, uh, Jennie Mandeville.
She keeps coming in here
and confessing to stuff.

361
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:14,424
What was it this time?
She comes in, same as yesterday-
she says she accidentally killed her roommate.

362
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:19,759
So I take her into the back room,
and I turned on the tape recorder.
Turns out her roommate was a hamster.

363
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,561
She didn't look unstable.

364
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:26,297
They never do.
Okay, can we get back to work now?
The missing diamond, remember?

365
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,032
Ka-ching!

366
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:32,406
"Ka-ching"?
She is putting
so much pressure on me.

367
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:36,208
She's obsessed
with this million dollar reward-
obsessed.

368
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:40,047
All right. Well, Adrian,
she's worried about money.
Now, I know a lot of people are.

369
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:45,920
Not me. When I was on the force,
I used to hate cashing my paycheck.
I still do.

370
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,654
To me, police work is-
it's like a higher calling,
like the priesthood.

371
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,289
But you know, Adrian,
even priests have to get paid.

372
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:58,825
But i-it brings up an interesting question,
something I would like to explore with you.

373
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:03,067
What would you do
if you had a million dollars?

374
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:09,080
Oh. Well, uh, I guess I'd-

375
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:14,551
I'd hire you full-time
and keep you on retainer, 24-7.

376
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,782
Maybe I'd buy you a house
right next to mine,

377
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:21,121
so I could just drop in anytime.

378
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:25,185
Heh. This is fun.
What would you do
with a million dollars?

379
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,823
Buy an island-

380
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:33,235
a desert island in... the middle of nowhere.

381
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:38,105
So, w-we would do our sessions
o-over the phone?

382
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:42,806
Well, you see-
see, this island, in my mind-

383
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,815
no phone service.

384
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:49,448
I guess I'd have to buy a boat.
Well, see, that's funny,

385
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:55,153
because the island
in-in my fantasy- no dock.

386
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:00,294
Well, may the best man win.

387
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:06,393
Excuse me! What are you doing?
Did you see that? There-

388
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:10,999
There was someone out there.
I'm going to have to report this.
It's- It's okay. It's okay.

389
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:15,444
It's just another detective
trying to find the diamond.

390
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,504
There's a whole bunch of them.

391
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:22,485
Yesterday they followed us
down the coast to that big
meditation center in Monterey.

392
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,853
Oh, I've been there.
It-It's just beautiful.

393
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:29,325
But this was years ago,
when Jennie Mandeville was still alive.

394
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:36,200
Jennie... Mandeville.
Jennie Mandeville.
Yeah, she owned the property.

395
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:41,705
There's this big plaque there
with her name on it.
That's right.

396
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,177
I remember.
I saw it.

397
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,203
What?

398
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,343
I just solved the case.
I think I know where that diamond is.

399
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:58,048
Ugh! I have to go.
We'll add 20 minutes on
to my next session.

400
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,590
Ah, A-Adrian.
Adrian, I'm sorry. I have a policy.

401
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:04,059
I-If- If you leave early, I have to
charge you for the whole session.

402
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:06,119
Yeah.
Mmm. It's-

403
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,790
Uh-
Okay.

404
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,901
O-kay. O-kay?

405
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,204
Okay.

406
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:32,984
<i>Natalie! Natalie, I did it.</i>
<i>I solved the case!</i>
<i>I know where the diamond is!</i>

407
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:36,891
What? So where is it?
It's at the police station.
It's been there the whole time!

408
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:39,953
It's been right under our nose.
Oh, my God.

409
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,226
<i>Who would do that to my car?</i>

410
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:48,332
Oh, my God.
Natalie, they're listening.

411
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,340
What?

412
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,342
What I meant was,

413
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,506
I didn't solve the case. I wish I had.
I'm completely stumped.
What are you talking about?

414
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,675
No. Wait.
What I really meant was,
I <i>did</i> solve the case.

415
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:04,518
The diamond is in the Philippines.
We gotta go to the airport,
fly to the Philippines.

416
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,524
Well, if we're gonna run,
just run. Run!

417
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,363
<i>Monk! Mr. Monk!</i>

418
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,421
Come on!

419
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,064
Hey!
I'm watchin' you!

420
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,769
Mr. Monk.
Mr. Monk!

421
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,832
Move, you little runt!

422
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,809
Here! Here! Here!

423
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,747
They ran down that alley.

424
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,061
Get outta the way.

425
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,622
I say, Mr. Monk!
Slow down!

426
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:03,112
Hey, stop!

427
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:10,944
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

428
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,991
17, 18, 19-

429
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,395
I can't believe this guy.

430
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,431
I say, Mr. Monk.
Get outta the way!

431
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:48,591
Can you see him?

432
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:51,822
We lost him.
Wait.

433
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:56,196
We've been following Monk.
We've been watching Monk.
Why don't we try thinking like Monk?

434
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,935
Think like Monk.
Think like Monk.
Think like Monk.

435
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:03,132
<i>Think like Monk.</i>
<i>Think like Monk.</i>
<i>Think like Monk.</i>

436
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,135
<i>Gee!</i>

437
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:26,395
- <i>What are you doin'?</i>
- He went that way.

438
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:34,669
I think we lost 'em.
You keep saying that,
but we never do.

439
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,642
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Taxi! Taxi!

440
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:45,440
Police headquarters, Vinton Street.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doin', chief?

441
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:48,007
I'm with her.
You got to ride in the back.
That's the rule.

442
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,681
Ah, I-I-I'd prefer to sit up front.
It's one of my things.
It's true. It's one of his things.

443
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:55,192
- Well, here's one of my things:
Nobody rides in the front.
- I'm afraid it's not negotiable.

444
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:59,821
- Who's negotiatin'?
That's it. I'm outta here.
- No. W-W-W-Wait, wait, wait.

445
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:04,459
- I'll give you, uh, 50 bucks
if you let him ride up front.
- Why? What's he gonna do?

446
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:09,370
Nothing. Nothing. He's got a cluster of,
uh, compulsions and phobias that manifest
themselves in a variety of-you know?

447
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,670
It's one of those things! He has things!

448
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:14,267
A hundred dollars.

449
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,677
- All right. Seventy-two.
That's all I have.
- Welcome aboard.

450
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:21,207
Whoa. Whoa, uh, wait.
This inspection sticker expired yesterday.

451
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:24,482
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm takin' care of that tomorrow.
- It expired. It's expired.

452
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:29,652
Mr. Monk, it's a million dollars.
Please get in the cab for me.

453
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:33,163
- It's expired.
- Well, forget about it. Forget about it.
Give me back my money.

454
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:36,962
No refunds. It's one of <i>my</i> things.

455
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,002
Monk!
Oh, Mr. Monk! Mr. Monk!

456
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,335
Now couldn't we, uh-
Couldn't we sort something out here?

457
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:45,398
Monk!

458
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:52,848
Where's-Where's-Where's-

459
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,908
- Di-
- Di-

460
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,710
Oh, Disher.
Yeah, yeah.

461
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:00,313
- I-I think he's in the observation room.
- Come on.

462
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:05,351
Oh, all right, Gladys.
We're bein' followed.
Don't tell anybody you saw us!

463
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:13,602
They locked the doors!
It says "Push"!
Get outta the way!

464
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:22,877
That way.

465
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:26,906
Lieutenant! Lieutenant, remember
the security guard that you arrested?
Yeah.

466
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,316
Where did you interrogate him?
Right there- Room "B."

467
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:32,015
Ah! And the girl
that kept confessing,
Jennie Mandeville-

468
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:34,387
- Where did you take her?
- Uh, Room "A" then Room "D."

469
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:38,918
- So she was never in there?
It's gotta still be in there. It's in that room.
- What's in there? Monk, what's going on?

470
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:42,329
- Tell you later.
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
You cannot come in here.

471
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,233
My two friends are American citizens.
They have a right to be here.

472
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:48,466
Myself, I am on a temporary visa...
which I hope to extend.

473
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,975
- Are they with you?
- Only in the strictest,
most terrible sense of the word.

474
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,637
- I heard you tell your shrink
you solved the case.
- <i>Excuse me.</i>

475
00:36:57,014 --> 00:37:01,644
Nobody's going anywhere-
not until we know what he knows.

476
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:06,747
All right, you just made a big mistake
my friend. I happen to be a police captain,
and this is an unlawful imprisonment.

477
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:10,817
Book him.
You're under arrest. Turn around.

478
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:17,394
Fine.
Give me your hands.

479
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:20,232
- Do you have your cuffs?
- In my office.

480
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,933
It's in there, isn't it?

481
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:27,068
The diamond-
it's in that very room.
What?

482
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:29,009
It is?
Uh, no, uh-
Get the door!

483
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:35,850
Shut up!
Everybody, shut up.

484
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,754
Everybody but Monk.
Monk, what's goin' on?

485
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:43,055
Okay, here's what happened.

486
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:46,187
The woman who founded
the meditation center
was named Jennie Mandeville.

487
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:50,200
- Who, the confessor?
- No. No, no, no. The girl you met
was not the real Jennie Mandeville.

488
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:55,035
<i>She got the name from a plaque</i>
<i>she saw up at the retreat.</i>

489
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,267
<i>She needed a fake name.</i>
<i>Maybe she liked the sound of it.</i>

490
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:03,280
- What was she doing up there?
- She went there to kill Danny Chasen,
the guy in the rolltop desk.

491
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:07,343
<i>It was probably her boyfriend's idea.</i>

492
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:11,081
<i>Jewel thieves are like children.</i>
<i>They hate to share.</i>

493
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:19,229
This is a very crowded room.
This is a very, very, very, very, very,
<i>very</i>, very, very, very, very-

494
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,164
Monk, Monk, Monk, Monk,
it's okay. It's okay.
Who was her boyfriend?

495
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,565
He was the security guard
that Randy arrested.

496
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,627
<i>He was the jewel thief.</i>
<i>He was the inside man.</i>

497
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,401
<i>The diamond was still in his pocket</i>
<i>when you were talking to him.</i>

498
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,671
<i>That's right. We brought him here</i>
<i>right from the museum.</i>

499
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:37,043
<i>I remember before the interrogation</i>
<i>he was chewing a big piece of gum.</i>

500
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:41,380
<i>But when I saw him after the interrogation,</i>
<i>the gum was gone.</i>

501
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:46,219
<i>He must have panicked in that room.</i>
<i>You had him on the drug charges.</i>
<i>He knew he was about to be arrested-</i>

502
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:50,852
<i>which of course meant he'd be searched-</i>
<i>so he hid the rock right there under the table.</i>

503
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:54,295
<i>With his chewing gum!</i>
<i>People do it in restaurants all the time.</i>

504
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:57,766
<i>I've written letters to my congressman</i>
<i>and to the editor. What can I do?</i>

505
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:01,271
He telephoned his girlfriend
from jail to tell her where
he stashed the diamond.

506
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,103
And that's why
she was coming in here
confessing to everything.

507
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,235
And why she was always
asking to switch rooms.
She was trying to get in there.

508
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:09,939
Oh- oh, okay.
I changed my mind.

509
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,710
There's seven of us,
and we're all adults.

510
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:17,015
- We'll just divide the money seven ways.
- No way. We were here first.

511
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,955
It's only fair we divide the proceeds.
We have been working in tandem.

512
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,993
We've not been working in tandem.
You've been chasing us.
That's not tandem.

513
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,928
Excuse me, could I say one thing?
You and you and you-

514
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,295
uh, you're breathing my air.

515
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,530
What about them?
They're breathing your air,
you're breathing his-

516
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:35,800
It's complicated.
Uh, but if these two dropped back, um-

517
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:39,036
Monk. Monk, it's okay.
I'll call for help.
Okay.

518
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,738
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Gladys.

519
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:46,249
N-N-N-No. Gladys! Gladys!
No! Come on, lady! No!

520
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:50,447
Monk? Is that you?

521
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:53,046
Go home!
No, no, no!
Come on. Take the day off!

522
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:57,660
I told you to leave me alone.

523
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:02,261
Somebody barfed
in the bathroom!

524
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,665
Hey! Hey!

525
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:12,604
There it is. No! No!

526
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:16,134
Okay. Fine. Look.

527
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:20,946
- I'm gonna clean under the table
just like you want, okay?
- No! No!

528
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:24,351
Over! Clean over the table!

529
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,932
I can't look.

530
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,525
Ka-ching.

531
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,763
Oh, God.

532
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:59,721
<i>She came in again late last night,</i>
<i>said she has something to confess to.</i>

533
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,884
This time we got
a real confession out of her.
Okay, listen to this:

534
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,795
"Gladys Menchen, who was employed
by a local cleaning service
for the last 22 years,

535
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:12,199
will be flown to London on a private jet
to pick up her reward."

536
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:17,536
"Miss Menchen found the stolen gem
while cleaning <i>under</i> a table
in an interrogation room."

537
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:20,042
What? You're blaming me?
<i>Under</i> a table.

538
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,704
Why would they even want it back?
There's gum all over it.

539
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:27,342
I've got some good news-
sort of a consolation prize.
I talked to the commissioner.

540
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,943
He's gonna put you
under contract.
Really?

541
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,011
Put you on a retainer.

542
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:37,391
He has guaranteed you 16 homicides
a year for the next two years.

543
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:41,192
Sixteen a year? Well, what hap-
What about after that?

544
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:46,259
Well, we'll have to take it
one year at a time. We'll see.
