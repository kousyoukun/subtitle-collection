(Museum Official)
Hello and good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:05,473 --> 00:00:07,441
I am very pleased
to welcome you

3
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:09,343
to the Macmillan Museum.

4
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:11,512
Today, as you may have
read outside,

5
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,347
we are featuring
an extensive showcase

6
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:14,748
of The Cromwell Collection.

7
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:19,353
It is the largest private
collection in Europe.

8
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:21,655
The Cromwell family
has collected everything

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,458
from furniture and paintings
to medieval weaponry.

10
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:27,328
This, of course,
is the crown jewel

11
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,629
of the exhibit.

12
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,431
No pun intended.

13
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,432
The Alexander Diamond.

14
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:35,069
It was worn by Queen Elizabeth
at her coronation.

15
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:37,805
Experts have called it
the most perfect diamond

16
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,707
in the world.

17
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,842
You're probably wondering
what it's worth.

18
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,644
Actually, no one knows.

19
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,379
But I can tell you this.

20
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:47,748
That little rock has been
insured by Lloyd's of London

21
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:51,485
for $20 million.

22
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,652
[Randy Newman ragtime theme]

23
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:34,422
* It's a jungle out there

24
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:38,692
* Disorder and confusion
everywhere *

25
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:41,295
* No one seems to care

26
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:42,363
* Well, I do

27
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,732
* Hey, who's in charge here?

28
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:48,602
* It's a jungle out there

29
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:51,939
* Poison in the very air
we breathe *

30
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,342
* You know what's in
the water that you drink? *

31
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:58,412
* Well, I do,
and it's a-ma-zing *

32
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:01,882
* People think I'm crazy
'cause I worry all the time *

33
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:05,453
* If you paid attention,
you'd be worried too *

34
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:09,523
* You'd better pay attention
or this world we love so much *

35
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:13,461
* Might just kill you

36
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:14,995
* I could be wrong now

37
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,598
* But I don't think so

38
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:20,501
* 'Cause it's
a jungle out there *

39
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,437
* It's a jungle
out there *

40
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,646
That's $42.80.

41
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,549
Okay, there we go.

42
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,851
And I have a coupon.

43
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:42,256
I can't take this,
it expired yesterday.

44
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,724
Yesterday?

45
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,860
Oh, she's right.
Darn.

46
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,897
Sometimes I wish
I had a time machine.

47
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,832
Wait, if you
had a time machine,

48
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:54,535
you would use it to go back
to save 50 cents on Lysol?

49
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,003
Yes. Yes, I would.

50
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,406
You wouldn't use it
to save Abraham Lincoln?

51
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,440
Fine, I'll save Lincoln.

52
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,309
It never ends with you.

53
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:02,310
Sir, do you have
a different card?

54
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:03,311
It says declined.

55
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,346
Declined?

56
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,316
Mr. Monk, do you have
any money in the bank?

57
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:09,550
No.

58
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,452
That could be it.

59
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,554
Okay.

60
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,788
Um...
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:15,923
Please hurry.

62
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,492
All right, I've got...

63
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:19,860
$34.

64
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:20,928
Is that it?

65
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,497
Yesterday was payday.

66
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:25,065
Yes, it was.
But I didn't get paid.

67
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,867
You know, your paydays
are becoming sort of...

68
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,735
theoretical.

69
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,371
Come on, you need to
put some stuff back.

70
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:33,040
No, I can't.

71
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,843
Look, I made a list.

72
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,010
Everything here
is on the list.

73
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,412
I know, I know.

74
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:40,080
We're gonna come back later
and pick it up.

75
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,482
Come on, people are waiting.

76
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:44,618
Okay.

77
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:45,953
Uh, this then.

78
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:48,088
Oh wait, no.
I need this.

79
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:52,660
Oh, this.
Gotta have this spray.

80
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:54,828
All right, how about
one of these?

81
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:57,398
Yeah, this one. No!

82
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,500
Um, no.

83
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,501
Let's go with that one.

84
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:01,802
Oh, wait a second.

85
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,740
It's like Sophie's choice.

86
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,676
Except it's soup.

87
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:09,610
Okay, we're keeping
the soup.

88
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:14,382
Putting back this,
this, this, and this.

89
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:16,116
Mr. Monk, look at us.
This is ridiculous.

90
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,551
We're both broke.

91
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:19,019
We haven't had a new case
in three weeks.

92
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,621
What do you want me to do?

93
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,922
You need to get a raise.

94
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:22,556
You gotta talk
to the captain.

95
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,024
We can't go on like this.

96
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:27,595
I'm not good at this,
asking for more money.

97
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:30,498
Okay, then let me
do the talking.

98
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:31,765
I'm not good at that either.

99
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:34,668
Mr. Monk, you deserve
a raise.

100
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,570
You've solved a lot
of big cases for them

101
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:37,571
single-handedly.

102
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:38,806
Maybe I helped a little.

103
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,674
No, no, no, no.
You can't think like that.

104
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,142
You gotta brag
about yourself.

105
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,411
You gotta toot
your own horn.

106
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:44,845
I'm not much
of a tooter.

107
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,747
(Natalie)
You better learn
how to toot.

108
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,748
(Monk)
Toot's a funny word.

109
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,417
Hilarious.

110
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,618
Oh, hello.
Gladys.

111
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,152
Natalie Teeger,
this is Gladys.

112
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,687
Gladys is great.

113
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:54,922
Gladys has been
cleaning up around here

114
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,089
for years.

115
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,926
I used to help her out
in my spare time.

116
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,694
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

117
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:01,962
Remember?
Yeah.

118
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,665
Until I got
that restraining order.

119
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,066
Remember?
Good times.

120
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,101
Good times.

121
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:10,804
You have to get underneath,
right, Gladys?

122
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:12,039
Under?
Why?

123
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,707
Nobody ever looks there.

124
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:14,908
But you'll know it's clean.

125
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,544
Isn't that
its own reward?

126
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:17,945
You'll know.

127
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,680
The captain says I don't
have to talk to you.

128
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,014
I know, I know.

129
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,950
But under, okay?
Under the table.

130
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,519
I wanna help you guys, okay?
I really do.

131
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:26,920
They already questioned me
four times.

132
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,689
(Disher)
It's not just you,
Mr. Landis.

133
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,691
We talking to all the guards,
the cleaning staff.

134
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,593
Curators, anybody
who was at the museum.

135
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:33,994
Yeah, but I haven't even
been home yet.

136
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,996
And I appreciate that.

137
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,164
We just need
your official statement,

138
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,632
then you're free to go.

139
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,467
So, for the record,

140
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,934
where were you
during the robbery?

141
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,936
For the fifth time,
okay, I was at my station

142
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,773
on the main floor.
I never left.

143
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:46,674
I didn't even
go to the bathroom.

144
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,909
And you didn't hear
anything unusual?

145
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,845
No, sir.
I was three floors away.

146
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,581
Okay.

147
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:54,882
Excuse me for a second.

148
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:55,883
Can I get you
something to drink?

149
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,551
No.

150
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:01,722
Monk, Nat.

151
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:02,790
What's going on?

152
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:03,857
Oh, you haven't heard?

153
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,092
Robbery at the
Macmillan Museum.

154
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,894
It was big big.

155
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,796
The Alexander Diamond.

156
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,531
Whoa.
I know whoa.

157
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,032
Robbery division asked us
to help out,

158
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,902
so we're taking statements
from everybody on site.

159
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,203
So you're not arresting him
about the drugs.

160
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,038
Uh, no.
What drugs?

161
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,807
His fingertips are stained.

162
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,942
Looks like
red phosphorous.

163
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,177
You get that
from making crystal meth.

164
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:26,947
He's gotta
have a lab somewhere.

165
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,750
Okay, I'll check it out.

166
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,784
Excuse me, Mr. Landis.

167
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:33,587
Could you come here, please?

168
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:34,655
If the captain needs me,

169
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,890
I'll be in
interrogation room B.

170
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:39,059
Uh, right this way.

171
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,497
What?
You know what.

172
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:46,734
You just solved that case.
For free.

173
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,135
What was I supposed to do?

174
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,136
Well, if you're selling
ice cream,

175
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,170
would you hand out
free scoops?

176
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,506
What was I supposed
to say?

177
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,874
Hey, Lieutenant,
there's a drug dealer

178
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:54,608
somewhere in this room.

179
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,276
I'll tell you who it is
for $20.

180
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,879
At least we'd have $20.

181
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,180
All right,
there's the captain.

182
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,815
Remember, you deserve
a raise.

183
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,283
You deserve it!

184
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,685
Okay, when you're right,
you're right.

185
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,754
Okay, Captain?
Hey, Monk.

186
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:07,721
What are you doing here?

187
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:09,189
Captain, I have to
talk to you about something.

188
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,624
Can it wait?

189
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:13,827
Okay.
Well, we'll come back.

190
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:16,864
We're back.

191
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:21,669
And...
Natalie?

192
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:22,803
Captain...

193
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,304
If this is about money,
forget about it.

194
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,273
We're broke.
The department is strapped.

195
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,842
We just got
another hiring freeze.

196
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,010
Captain, we haven't
had a new case

197
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,011
in three weeks.

198
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,680
You know, you're right.

199
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:33,814
There hasn't been
a major homicide

200
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,282
in a long time.

201
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:36,850
But you gotta
keep your hopes up.

202
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:37,851
Stay optimistic.

203
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:39,152
Okay, well,
thank you very much.

204
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,721
Okay, Captain, come on,
we can't just sit around

205
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:41,789
waiting for
the phone to ring.

206
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:42,823
It's not fair to us.

207
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,692
We have no security.

208
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:45,859
What do you want me
to do?

209
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,060
We wanna be put
on retainer.

210
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,829
What?

211
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:49,830
Yeah, retainer.
Like a lawyer.

212
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,965
We want a guaranteed income.

213
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:52,733
Look, it doesn't
have to be much.

214
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,903
We just need
a little security.

215
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:59,573
Okay, I'll see
what I can do.

216
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:01,975
But don't get
your hopes up, okay?

217
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,010
Anything else?

218
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,048
It's about Gladys.

219
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,917
Have you been talking
to Gladys?

220
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,718
Captain...

221
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,085
I told you
not to talk to Gladys.

222
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,588
She's not cleaning
under the tables again--

223
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:15,956
squish!

224
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:24,898
I think you
should talk to her.

225
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:28,068
I will.
About her aim.

226
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,009
Get him downstairs.

227
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:39,980
You were right.

228
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,882
I get this guy
in the room,

229
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,050
he's denying everything.

230
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:43,851
He's twitching,
he's nervous.

231
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,152
I threaten to get
a search warrant

232
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,654
and tear his house apart.

233
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:47,955
I pick up the phone,
I start to dial,

234
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,890
he collapses.

235
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:50,924
He gave it all up.

236
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,793
Crystal meth lab
in his basement.

237
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,028
Narcotics is
on their way over.

238
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:56,363
I owe you one.

239
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:57,865
Okay.

240
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:58,866
What?

241
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,100
You know what.

242
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,970
Oh, the thing?

243
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,838
About the ice cream
and the free scoops?

244
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:06,306
That's right.

245
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,880
Mr. Monk?

246
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,381
We're rich.
We hit the jackpot.

247
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:15,983
Oh, good.

248
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,685
Look, it's about
the Alexander Diamond.

249
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:18,719
Lloyd's of London
is offering

250
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:21,054
a $1 million reward
to anybody that finds it.

251
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,890
No questions asked.

252
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:23,957
So?

253
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,794
Mr. Monk, you can find
that diamond.

254
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,295
Aah, I don't think so.

255
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,764
What?
You're a great detective.

256
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:31,799
You solve crimes
all the time

257
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:32,966
without even trying.

258
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,334
It's annoying
how many crimes you solve.

259
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,003
Come on!
Let's go for it.

260
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,105
Let's cash in!

261
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:42,876
Natalie, I don't do
what I do for money.

262
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,812
Mr. Monk,
it's a million dollars.

263
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:49,182
You'll never have to worry
for the rest of your life.

264
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:50,718
Well, of course,
you'll worry.

265
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,852
But not about money.

266
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:54,888
I don't know.

267
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:56,857
Mr. Monk,
you have to do this.

268
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,860
I mean, I love this job,
but I have to get paid.

269
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:03,764
Just--just please.

270
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:04,898
Just say yes.
Say you'll do it.

271
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:07,968
Just say yes.

272
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,770
Could you get off
my counter?

273
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,175
Okay, fine.
I'll do it.

274
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,912
* A million dollars
a million dollars *

275
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:25,018
Congratulations.

276
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,482
Excuse me.
Any suspect yet?

277
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:58,151
I wouldn't know,
I'm just delivering flowers.

278
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,386
No, you're not.

279
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,822
You're a private detective,
just like me.

280
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,156
Well, not quite like me.

281
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,058
Me, a detective?

282
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:07,194
That's pretty funny,
actually.

283
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,796
I can't wait
to tell the guys back at...

284
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,530
Look, you're insulting me.

285
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,799
That satellite dish
on your roof.

286
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,266
The number on the side, 555.

287
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,136
Obviously a fake.

288
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,404
Conclusion number one,
you're after

289
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,139
the Alexander Diamond.

290
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,173
Conclusion number two.

291
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,975
You haven't got a prayer.

292
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,179
Excuse me,
that's a handicapped spot.

293
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:29,216
It's okay, I'm psychotic.

294
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,350
Is this where
they stole the rock?

295
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,052
You addressing me?

296
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,788
Not anymore.
You, Poindexter.

297
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:37,490
Is this the scene
of the crime?

298
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:38,792
Excuse me, boys,
I got a million dollars

299
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:40,193
waiting for me inside.

300
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,888
[door opens]

301
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,157
Ah, apparently
we think alike.

302
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,324
Frightening thought
for those of us

303
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:13,493
who aren't you.

304
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,028
Uh, Phillip Wick.

305
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,429
Access to all areas.
This'll do me.

306
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,065
Hello again.

307
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,570
What does this say?

308
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,338
Curator Sally Kanter.

309
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,507
Here, try this one,
Robert Gant.

310
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,209
That's a boy's name.

311
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,078
Uh, look, chaps,
since we're all

312
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:32,445
after the same thing,

313
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,214
why don't we just
pool our talents?

314
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,883
What are you talking about?

315
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,585
Well, work together
and split the reward.

316
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,420
Why don't we begin by
introducing ourselves,

317
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,289
all right?
My name's St. Clare.

318
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,357
Retired Scotland Yard
Inspector.

319
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:45,392
I moved to San Francisco--

320
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,127
I'm interrupting you.

321
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,129
No frigging way.

322
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,397
I'm finding that rock myself.

323
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,865
And I'm keeping
all the money.

324
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,533
Well, may the best man win.

325
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,268
I intend to.

326
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,270
He said man.

327
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,943
This entire wing was locked.

328
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,477
I mean, it was
completely locked down.

329
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:05,612
Somehow they opened
that connecting door

330
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,547
from the inside.

331
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,117
We can't figure it out.

332
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,484
What do you think?

333
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,585
I don't know yet.

334
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:13,954
Well, come on, focus.
Concentrate.

335
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:16,223
Do that thing you do.

336
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:17,290
I've never seen you like this.

337
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,226
What, broke?

338
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:25,933
Ah.

339
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,167
What-what-what-what?

340
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,138
These scratches here and here.

341
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:35,075
Looks like these tire irons
weren't heavy enough

342
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,276
to do the job.

343
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:39,246
Gentlemen,
we have competition.

344
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,148
That is Adrian Monk.

345
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,349
Adrian Monk?
I thought he worked homicide.

346
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,517
(Dirk)
What are you two
afraid of?

347
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:48,255
Something's off here.

348
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:49,122
What is it?

349
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,295
Glass shards
on the inside.

350
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:04,637
When that case was shattered,
this case was open.

351
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:07,074
I think they took this weapon,
used it,

352
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:09,509
and put it back
and relocked the case.

353
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,444
What does that tell us?

354
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,213
A lot.

355
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,547
It means it was
an inside job.

356
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,216
And they didn't
want us to know

357
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,585
it was an inside job.

358
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:19,586
Ka-ching.

359
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,188
What does that mean?

360
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,255
[over headphones]
It means
we're gonna be rich.

361
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,124
Ka-ching.

362
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:27,160
This guy's good.

363
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:28,996
What's he saying?

364
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,298
Put that thing away.

365
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:32,665
Excuse me, sir.

366
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:36,503
Did anything unusual happen

367
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,205
Tuesday before the break-in?

368
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:40,140
Anything at all
out of the ordinary?

369
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:41,641
No.

370
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,210
Well, now that
you mention it,

371
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:46,046
Tuesday afternoon I heard,
or I thought I heard

372
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,715
somebody whispering.
Whispering.

373
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:52,385
It wasn't in this room,
it was down the hallway.

374
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,753
It was about 2:30.

375
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,223
I was standing about there.

376
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:59,159
And I thought I heard
someone saying,

377
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:00,427
"My womb."

378
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,029
"My room"?

379
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,563
"My womb."
It was a man's voice.

380
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:04,697
And he was saying it
over and over.

381
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:05,732
My womb...

382
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,200
I thought it was coming

383
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:08,201
from that vent,

384
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:09,202
but it's impossible.

385
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:10,403
[phone rings]

386
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:11,538
I think I'm going senile.

387
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,107
I'm sorry,
I've got to take this.

388
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:15,108
Hello?
My womb.

389
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,109
My womb.
My womb.

390
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,344
It sounds like a mantra.

391
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,279
Like, a meditation.

392
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,214
My womb.

393
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:38,331
Look at this.

394
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,033
What?
It's a footprint.

395
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:45,272
Somebody was hiding
in here.

396
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,274
Wait, in there?

397
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:51,211
That's how they opened
the connecting door.

398
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,046
Let's grab the detectives,
we need an evidence kit.

399
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,247
Wait, not yet.

400
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:55,515
What do you mean,
not yet?

401
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,150
Let's find the diamond,
then we'll tell 'em

402
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,185
how we did it.

403
00:16:58,218 --> 00:16:59,386
Natalie, this is
not a game show.

404
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:04,224
This is a felony investi--

405
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,296
It's a broken necklace.

406
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,233
That's an unusual design.

407
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:14,134
(Natalie)
Oh, good, good, good.

408
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,668
We'll try to ID it.

409
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,270
Come on, let's go.

410
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,308
Sorry.

411
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,646
You okay?

412
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,781
I don't know,
something's...

413
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:29,849
Something's wrong.
I...

414
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,818
[muttering]

415
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:36,456
I'm not balanced.

416
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,594
(Rufus)
Um, excuse me.

417
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:43,430
Yeah, um, I'm gonna be
needing that back.

418
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,198
Because I only
have two of them

419
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,566
and the other one
doesn't work.

420
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,236
Are you following us?

421
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:50,503
What?

422
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:51,771
Ah, Mr. Monk.
What an honor.

423
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,606
My name's St. Clare.
Inspector St. Clare.

424
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,675
I've been following
your cases assiduously

425
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,410
from across the pond,
you know.

426
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,246
Shakespeare, nobody cares.

427
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,114
Wait, I can't believe
you're following us.

428
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:02,115
Is that a lead?

429
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:04,751
Maybe.

430
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,319
Look, Mr. St. Clare.

431
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:07,320
Inspector.

432
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:08,521
I'm sure a gentleman
like yourself

433
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:11,191
can appreciate the fact
that these two leads

434
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:12,392
belong to us.

435
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,593
Two leads?

436
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,663
Well, yes, the necklace
and the initials

437
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:17,764
carved in the desk.

438
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:19,098
Mr. Monk.
I'm sorry.

439
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:30,177
Excuse me.

440
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,580
My name is Jennie Mandeville.

441
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:37,817
And I did something
I'd like to confess.

442
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,686
What'd you do, Jennie?

443
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:46,493
I robbed a bank.

444
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:47,927
It was about
three weeks ago.

445
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,663
The Community Savings Trust
in Sausalito.

446
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:53,233
Sausalito.

447
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:54,901
I don't remember
anything about that.

448
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,936
I'll take it.

449
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,905
Hi, I'm Lieutenant Disher.

450
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,440
Uh, Jennie.
Miss Mandeville.

451
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:11,318
Just have a seat.

452
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,324
Uh, is there a problem?

453
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,692
I'm claustrophobic.

454
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:20,927
Is this the only room
that you have?

455
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,963
All the rooms are
the same size, Miss.

456
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,766
Please, just have a seat.

457
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:30,570
This is Lieutenant Disher.

458
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,573
I'm in interrogation room A
with Jennie Mandeville.

459
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:37,244
So, you say
you robbed a bank.

460
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:39,846
That's right.

461
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,982
I went inside and...

462
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,518
I saw one of those pens.

463
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,954
You know,
chained to the desk?

464
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,523
And I really needed a pen.

465
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:54,994
So, I snapped it off
and I put it in my purse.

466
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,297
You stole a pen?

467
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,901
One pen?

468
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,338
Oh, God.

469
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:06,973
Do you think God
will forgive me?

470
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:10,410
I don't know, Ma'am.

471
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,011
But we do.

472
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,981
You're free to go.

473
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,423
What is up with
those three detectives?

474
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:24,757
Do you think we lost them?

475
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,593
Oh, Natalie,
they are not detectives.

476
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,628
They're rent-a-cops.

477
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,930
They're hired guns.
They are mercenaries.

478
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,632
In other words, they're us.

479
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,701
This whole thing
is about greed.

480
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:35,968
You know how you always say
you'll thank me later?

481
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:37,003
You'll thank me later.

482
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,771
Oh, that's gotta be him.

483
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:42,008
Hello, are you Mr. Kwan?

484
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,012
I think he nodded.

485
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:49,382
That...
Was that a nod?

486
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,517
Sir?

487
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,984
Sir...

488
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,823
If that was a nod, nod.

489
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,958
Sir, we found this
at the scene of a crime.

490
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,427
A robbery.

491
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,994
We've been doing
some research.

492
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:03,496
This is your design,
isn't it?

493
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,897
You give these
to your students?

494
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:05,998
Natalie, please.

495
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:08,601
Sir, you...
You have a thread...

496
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:10,903
hanging right
in the middle there.

497
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,805
Just--I'll get it.

498
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,941
Just one little...
Uh...

499
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,509
Okay, Mr. Kwan,
you look like

500
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:17,677
a very busy man,
so I'm just gonna

501
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,678
get right to the point.

502
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:21,314
Do you have a student
that could fit inside

503
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:22,515
of a roll-top desk?

504
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:23,850
He can't be more than
five feet tall.

505
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:24,951
Does that ring a bell?

506
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,353
Or a gong?

507
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:27,987
Mr. Monk,
you're distracting him!

508
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,522
No, he's distracting me.

509
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:31,891
Is there anyone here
who's that small and limber?

510
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:34,060
Who could scrunch up
inside of a desk?

511
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,127
A scruncher?
A little scruncher?

512
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,096
Mr. Kwan, there's a lot
of money at stake here.

513
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,998
I got it.
I got it.

514
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:39,966
(St. Clare)
Well, well, well,
Mr. Monk.

515
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,935
We meet again.

516
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:43,770
Surprised?

517
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,072
Why don't you get
your own clues?

518
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:46,873
Well, normally I do.

519
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,741
But you two are
so easy to follow.

520
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:50,042
Especially when
you're kind enough

521
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:51,978
to keep your emergency
blinker on all day long.

522
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,480
I told you.

523
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:55,948
It's the safest way
to drive.

524
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,451
Wait, don't question
anybody yet.

525
00:21:58,485 --> 00:21:59,986
I have a voice stress
analyzer.

526
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,988
I'll be able to tell
if he's lying or not.

527
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,357
He hasn't said anything.

528
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:07,126
You are a pathetic
little frog, aren't you?

529
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,127
You thought you could
lose me, huh?

530
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,362
Well, you can all
just relax.

531
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:11,063
Dirk'll take it from here.

532
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:12,098
Hey, hippie.

533
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:13,966
You in charge?

534
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,101
My name is Dirk.

535
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,703
I'm a professional
bounty hunter.

536
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:18,871
I was wondering if I
could have a word with you.

537
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:19,972
Maybe this'll
change your mind.

538
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,674
I got $200 here.

539
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,142
$200?

540
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,011
They do use money
on your planet?

541
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:28,114
[all talking at once]

542
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,020
Cabin 14.

543
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:36,122
It doesn't say that.

544
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,824
You're good.

545
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:41,528
225.

546
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:46,098
His name is Chasen.
He's over at cabin 14.

547
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,079
Mr. Monk,
what are you doing?

548
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:13,059
Excuse me.

549
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,830
Hello, Mr. Chasen!

550
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:18,865
Is this your necklace?

551
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,567
We found it in a museum.

552
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,168
Okay, where's the diamond?
Hey!

553
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,036
Hey, I'm talking to you.

554
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:30,142
Wow, that's a really
deep trance.

555
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:36,783
Couldn't be deeper.

556
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:37,950
This man is dead.

557
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:50,930
Welcome back,
Miss Mandeville.

558
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,031
Have a seat.

559
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,033
You know the drill.

560
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:58,237
I don't like this room.

561
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,072
Please, Miss Mandeville,

562
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,774
you said you had something
important to tell me.

563
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:03,776
Something about a dead body.

564
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,912
And you said you didn't
wanna talk in my office.

565
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:09,649
I told you,
I'm claustrophobic.

566
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:10,650
What about another room?

567
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:12,985
All of our interrogation rooms
are the same size,

568
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:14,687
unfortunately.

569
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:17,490
No wet bars, no Jacuzzis.

570
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:19,726
Please just have a seat.

571
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:23,996
Now, you said
you found a body.

572
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,197
Your roommate's body.

573
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:30,570
This...
This is a real thing, right?

574
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:33,906
Not like, uh,
stealing the pen

575
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,808
from the bank?

576
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:39,946
Okay, good.
Tell me about it.

577
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,581
This is Lieutenant Disher.

578
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:42,915
I'm in interrogation room D

579
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:44,751
talking with
Jennie Mandeville.

580
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:46,085
Again.

581
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:47,987
So, let's start
from the beginning.

582
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,055
What was your
roommate's name?

583
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:51,057
Toni.

584
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,825
Toni?
Toni what?

585
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:53,993
I don't know.

586
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:57,029
You don't know.

587
00:24:57,063 --> 00:24:58,030
Male or female?

588
00:24:58,064 --> 00:24:59,532
I think male.

589
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:00,600
You're not sure?

590
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:04,036
To tell you the truth...

591
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,938
I just brought him home
the day before.

592
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:10,543
Okay.
Um...

593
00:25:10,577 --> 00:25:12,211
Let's move on.

594
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:17,316
So you came home,
you found Toni.

595
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,118
And you, what,
disposed of the body yourself?

596
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:22,254
You realize
that's a federal offense.

597
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:25,024
I couldn't take it, okay?

598
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:26,793
I couldn't just stand there
looking at it.

599
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:31,964
Jennie, what did you do
with the body?

600
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:34,300
I flushed it down
the toilet.

601
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,174
Was Toni a goldfish?

602
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,110
A hamster.

603
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:46,078
A hamster.

604
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,215
Okay.

605
00:25:55,622 --> 00:25:56,923
Here's the coroner's report.

606
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:58,791
Victim's name Danny Chasen.

607
00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:00,092
It's probably an alias.

608
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:01,060
Victim was poisoned.

609
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:04,063
Somebody spiked his
all natural barley tea

610
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:05,297
with ammonia.

611
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:07,667
Was he part of the heist?

612
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,735
Looks like it.

613
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,703
They found some hair samples
in that roll-top desk

614
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,238
at the museum.
They match the body.

615
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,372
What about the diamond?

616
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,074
Still missing in action.

617
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,709
Wasn't on him
or in the cabin.

618
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:17,944
We know he had a partner.

619
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:19,912
Somebody who works
at the museum.

620
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:21,247
It's probably
still with them.

621
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,649
Wait, wait, wait.

622
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:23,716
So the reward is still good,
right?

623
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,084
I mean, no one's claimed it.

624
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:28,721
Yes, as far as I know,
the offer is still good.

625
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:30,790
Ka-ching.

626
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,692
Uh, can you make her
stop saying that?

627
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:35,127
This is no longer
a parlor game.

628
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:37,664
A man is dead, this is
a homicide investigation now.

629
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:40,066
Which means nobody
is to withhold

630
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,902
any information
from anybody.

631
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:45,938
What, you're looking at me?

632
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:48,174
Yes, I am, Ms. Teeger.

633
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:49,709
(Gladys)
Did you write these?!

634
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:51,778
Don't deny it,
I know it was you!

635
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:56,749
"How are things down under?
Hint, hint."

636
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:59,385
"Monk was right, you should
clean under the table."

637
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:01,821
You don't fool me
for a second.

638
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:04,156
"It goes without saying,
don't forget to throw away

639
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,191
these little post-its too."

640
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:06,926
Captain, she never cleans
under the tables...

641
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,161
You are not
the boss of me!

642
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:10,429
Well, I think I am
the boss of you.

643
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,864
What makes you think
you're the boss of me?

644
00:27:11,898 --> 00:27:13,365
If I was the boss of you,
you'd be fired!

645
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,234
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

646
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:16,769
Hey, separate.

647
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,938
Both of you.
Monk, over there.

648
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,140
Gladys, can I have
a word with you, please?

649
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:28,981
Look, Gladys, he's Monk.

650
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:30,950
Try to ignore him.

651
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:35,121
Can you ignore him?

652
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,924
No, I can't.

653
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:40,392
Just do the best you can.

654
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:50,770
So you're not gonna
arrest me?

655
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:52,905
No, not this time, Miss.

656
00:27:52,939 --> 00:27:54,140
But listen, the next time
you feel like

657
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,174
confessing something,

658
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:56,008
you might wanna
call a priest.

659
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:59,946
Will you escort
Miss Mandeville out?

[whistles]

661
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,016
Who's she?

662
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,084
The Looney Tune
of the month.

663
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,319
Her name's Jennie Mandeville.

664
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,288
She keeps coming in here
and confessing to stuff.

665
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:10,857
What was it this time?

666
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,124
She comes in,
same as yesterday.

667
00:28:12,158 --> 00:28:14,493
Says she accidentally
killed her roommate.

668
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,962
So I take her into
the back room

669
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:17,997
and I turn on
the tape recorder.

670
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,866
Turns out her roommate
was a hamster.

671
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:22,969
She didn't look unstable.

672
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:23,803
They never do.

673
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:25,071
Okay, can we
get back to work now?

674
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:26,205
Missing diamond, remember?

675
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:28,140

Ka-ching.

677
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:32,311
She is putting
so much pressure on me.

678
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:35,014
She's obsessed with this
million-dollar reward.

679
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,048
Obsessed.

680
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:38,184
All right, well, Adrian,
she's worried about money.

681
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,086
Now, I know,
a lot of people are.

682
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,153
Not me.

683
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:42,421
When I was on the force,

684
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,423
I used to hate
cashing my paycheck.

685
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,225
I still do.

686
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:49,028
To me, police work
is like a higher calling.

687
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,529
Like the priesthood.

688
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,132
You know, Adrian, even priests
have to get paid.

689
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:56,035
But it brings up
an interesting question.

690
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,169
Something I would like to

691
00:28:57,203 --> 00:28:58,905
explore with you.

692
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:03,142
What would you do
if you had a million dollars?

693
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:08,080
Well, uh...

694
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:10,049
I guess I'd hire you
full time.

695
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,517
Mmm.

696
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,486
And keep you on retainer.
24/7.

697
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,924
Maybe I'd buy you a house
right next to mine.

698
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:18,991
So I could just drop in.

699
00:29:19,025 --> 00:29:22,361
Anytime.

00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,030
[chuckles]
This is fun.

701
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:25,064
What would you do
with a million dollars?

702
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:28,067
Buy an island.

703
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,937
A desert island in...

704
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:35,007
the middle of nowhere.

705
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:38,144
So we would do our sessions
over the phone?

706
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:39,345
[laughs]

707
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:43,549
Well, see, this island,
in my mind...

708
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:46,953
No phone service.

709
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:49,288
I guess I'd have to
buy a boat.

710

See, that's funny,
because, the island,

Well, may the best man win.

Excuse me!

What are you doing?
Did you see that?

716
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:08,040
There was someone out there.

717
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:09,041
I'm going to have to
report this.

718
00:30:09,075 --> 00:30:11,077
It's okay.
It's okay.

719
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,444

trying to find
the diamond.

721
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:17,449
There's a whole bunch
of them.

722
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:20,386
Yesterday, they followed us
down the coast

723
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,354
to that big meditation center
in Monterey.

724
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:24,356
Oh, I've been there.

725
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,992
It's just beautiful.

726

But this was years ago
when Jennie Mandeville

Yeah, she owned
the property.

731
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:40,072
There's this big plaque there
with her name on it.

732

That's right.

00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:58,457
I think he's in
the observation room.

824
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,729
Gladys, we're being followed.

825
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,297
Don't tell anybody
you saw us.

826
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,270
They locked the door!

827
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:12,838
It says "Push."

828
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:21,547
That way.

829
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:23,882
Lieutenant!

830
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,584
Lieutenant,
remember the security guard

831
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:26,618
that you arrested?
Yeah.

832
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:28,587
Where did you
interrogate him?

833
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,222
Right there, room B.

834
00:36:30,256 --> 00:36:31,457
And the girl
who kept confessing,

835
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,724
Jennie Mandeville,
where did you take her?

836
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:34,260
Room A then room D.

837
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:35,761
But she
was never in there?

838
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:36,962
No, no.
It's gotta still be in there.

839
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,597
In that room!
What's in there?

840
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,598
Monk, what's going on?

841
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:40,632
Tell you later.

842
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:42,000
Whoa, you cannot
come in here.

843
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,502
My two friends
are American citizens.

844
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:44,603
They have a right
to be here.

845
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:47,239
Myself, I am
on a temporary visa.

846
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:48,340
Which I hope to extend.

847
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:49,408
Are they with you?

848
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:50,476
Only in the strictest,

849
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:51,477
most terrible sense
of the word.

850
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,480
I heard you tell your shrink
you solved the case.

851
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:55,414
Excuse me.

852
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:58,817
Nobody's going anywhere.

853
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,487
Not until we know
what he knows.

854
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,455
You just made
a big mistake, my friend.

855
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:04,723
I happen to be
a police captain.

856
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:06,492
And this is
an unlawful imprisonment.

857
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:07,726
Book him.

858
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:10,662
You're under arrest.
Turn around.

859
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:18,470
Do you have
your cuffs?

860
00:37:18,504 --> 00:37:19,971
In my office.

861
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:23,875
It's in there, isn't it?

862
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,812
The diamond is in
that very room.

863
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,747
It is?

864
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,848
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

865
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:32,318
[all yelling]

866
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:35,554
Shut up!
Everybody, shut up!

867
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:39,458
Everybody but Monk.
Monk, what's going on?

868
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:41,760
Okay.

869
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,295
Here's what happened.

870
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:44,830
The woman who founded
the meditation center

871
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:45,897
was named Jennie Mandeville.

872
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,399
What, the confessor?

873
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:48,434
No, the girl you met

874
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:51,069
was not the real
Jennie Mandeville.

875
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,571
She got the name
from a plaque she saw

876
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,806
up at the retreat.

877
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,907
She needed a fake name,

878
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:57,343
maybe she liked
the sound of it.

879
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,345
What was she doing up there?

880
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:00,812
She went there
to kill Danny Chasen.

881
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:04,783
The guy in
the roll-top desk.

882
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:07,386
It was probably
her boyfriend's idea.

883
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:08,720
Jewel thieves
are like children.

884
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:11,423
They hate to share.

885
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,428
This is a very
crowded room.

886
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:17,963
This is a very very very
very very very...

887
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:20,666
Monk, Monk, it's okay.
It's okay.

888
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:21,700
Who was her boyfriend?

889
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:24,470
He was the security guard
that Randy arrested.

890
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:26,338
He was the jewel thief!

891
00:38:26,372 --> 00:38:27,272
He was the inside man.

892
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,874
The diamond was still
in his pocket

893
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,509
when you were
talking to him.

894
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:31,977
(Disher)
That's right,
we brought him here

895
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,111
right from the museum.

896
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,046
(Monk)
I remember before
the interrogation

897
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,915
he was chewing
a big piece of gum.

898
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:39,518
When I saw him
after the interrogation,

899
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:41,019
the gum was gone.

900
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,122
You had him
on the drug charges,

901
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,991
he knew he was
about to be arrested.

902
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:47,025
Which, of course, meant
he'd be searched.

903
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,126
He panicked.

904
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,595
He hid the diamond
right there

905
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:50,896
under the table.

906
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:52,664
(Stottlemeyer)
With his chewing gum.

907
00:38:52,698 --> 00:38:54,433
(Monk)
People do it in restaurants
all the time.

908
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:55,534
I've written letters
to my congressman

909
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:56,535
and to the editor.

910
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:57,403
What can I do?

911
00:38:57,436 --> 00:38:59,405
He must have telephoned
his girlfriend

912
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:00,539
from jail to tell her
where he stashed

913
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:01,573
the diamond.

914
00:39:01,607 --> 00:39:02,808
And that's why
she was coming in here

915
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:03,809
confessing to everything.

916
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:04,910
And why she was
always asking

917
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:05,977
to switch rooms,
'cause she was trying

918
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:06,978
to get in there.

919
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:08,514
O-okay.

920
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:09,815
I changed my mind.

921
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,584
There's seven of us
and we're all adults.

922
00:39:12,618 --> 00:39:14,019
We'll just divide the money

923
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,020
seven ways.

924
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,755
No way.
We were here first.

925
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:18,590
I think it's only fair
that we divide the proceeds.

926
00:39:18,624 --> 00:39:19,691
I mean, we have been
working in tandem.

927
00:39:19,725 --> 00:39:21,393
We've not been
working in tandem.

928
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:23,161
You've been chasing us.
That's not tandem.

929
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,430
Excuse me,
could I say one thing?

930
00:39:24,463 --> 00:39:26,832
You and you and you...

931
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,000
You're breathing my air.

932
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:31,002
What about them?
They're breathing your air.

933
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,438
You're breathing his.

934
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:34,506
It's complicated.

935
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,841
But if these two
dropped back--

936
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,108
Monk.
Monk, it's okay.

937
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:39,678
I'll call for help.

938
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,179
(Natalie)
Oh, my God.
Gladys.

939
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,548
No no no no no.

940
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:43,549
Oh, no no no no.

941
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:44,550
Gladys, no!

942
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,818
[all yelling]

943
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:49,054
[knocking on glass]
Monk?

944
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:50,088
Is that you?

945
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,691
[all yelling]

946
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,760
[knocking]

947
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:57,429
I told you
to leave me alone.

948
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:01,199
Somebody barfed
in the bathroom!

949
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,200
No, come on!

950
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,469
Hey!

951
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:04,570
[all yelling]

952
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:09,908
There it is.

953
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,977
[all yelling]

954
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:14,913
Okay, fine!

955
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:18,484
Look, I'm gonna clean
under the table

956
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:19,485
just like you want, okay?

957
00:40:19,518 --> 00:40:20,652
[all yelling]

958
00:40:20,686 --> 00:40:22,488
Go over the table
and clean!

959
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:23,989
Okay?
You happy?

960
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:35,634
I can't look.

961
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,069
Ka-ching.

962
00:40:40,506 --> 00:40:43,509
[laughing]

963
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:57,756
She came in again
late last night.

964
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,591
Said she had something
to confess to.

965
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:01,527
This time we got
a real confession.

966
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,061
Okay, listen to this.

967
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:04,129
"Gladys Winchim,
who was employed

968
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:07,833
"by a local cleaning service
for the last 22 years,

969
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:09,968
"will be flown to London
on a private jet

970
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:12,170
"to pick up her reward.

971
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,772
"Miss Winchim found
the stolen gem

972
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:17,709
while cleaning under a table
in an interrogation room."

973
00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:18,777
You're blaming me?

974
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,911
Under a table.

975
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:21,913
Why would they even
want it back?

976
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:22,948
There's gum all over it.

977
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:23,949
I've got some good news.

978
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,183
Sort of a consolation prize.

979
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,252
I talked to
the commissioner.

980
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:29,220
He's gonna put you
under contract.

981
00:41:29,254 --> 00:41:31,990
Really?
Put you on a retainer.

982
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:35,894
He has guaranteed you
16 homicides a year

983
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,596
for the next two years.

984
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:41,232
16 a year.
Well, what about after that?

985
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:44,570
Well, we'll have to take it
one year at a time.

986
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:46,304
