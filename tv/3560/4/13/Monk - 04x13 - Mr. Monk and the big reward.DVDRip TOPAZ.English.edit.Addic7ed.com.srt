<i>I still get goose bumps</i>
<i>every time I walk into this room.</i>

6
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:19,708
It is the largest
private collection in Europe.

7
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:24,883
The Cromwell family has collected
everything from furniture and paintings
to medieval weaponry.

This, of course,

the Alexander diamond.

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,468
It was worn by Queen Elizabeth
at her coronation.

But I can tell you this:

That little rock has been
insured by Lloyd's of London
for $20 million.

God, what is up with those three detectives?
Do you think we lost them?
Ah, Natalie, they are not detectives.

284
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:30,853
They're rent-a-cops. They're hired guns.
They are mercenaries.

285
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:34,763
In other words, they're us.
This whole thing is about greed.

286
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,826
Okay, you know how you always say
you'll thank me later? You'll thank me later.
Ooh, that's gotta be him.

287
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,896
<i>Hello, are you Mr. Kwan?</i>

288
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,347
[Monk]
I think he nodded. Was that...
Was that a... Was that a nod?

289
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,076
Sir? Sir, could...

290
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,919
If that was a nod, nod.

291
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,516
Sir, we found this
at the scene of a crime...
a robbery.

292
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,584
We've been doing some research.
This is your design, isn't it?

293
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:06,096
You give these to your students?
Natalie, please.

294
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:10,999
Sir, you... you, uh... you have a thread
hanging, uh, right in the middle, there.

295
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,094
I'll just... I'll get it.
Just one lone...

296
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,036
Um...
If you just...
<i>Okay.</i>

297
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,975
Okay. Mr. Kwan,
you look like a very busy man,
so I'm just gonna get right to the point.

298
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,036
Do you have a student that could fit
inside of a rolltop desk?

299
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:26,210
He can't be more than five feet tall.
Does that ring a bell... or a gong?

300
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,652
Mr. Monk,
you're distracting him.
No. He's distracting me.

301
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:33,452
Is there anyone here who is
that small and limber... who could
scrunch up inside of a desk?

302
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,459
A scruncher...
a little scruncher?

303
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,961
- Mr. Kwan, there's a lot of money
at stake here.
- Got it.

304
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,225
<i>[St. Clare]</i>
<i>Well, well, well. Mr. Monk.</i>

305
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:44,235
We meet again. Surprised?

306
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:48,797
- Why don't you get your own clues?
- Well, normally I do,
but you two are so easy to follow,

307
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:52,241
<i>especially when you're kind enough</i>
<i>to keep your emergency blinker on</i>
<i>all day long.</i>

308
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,007
I told you.
It's the safest way to drive.

309
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,277
<i>Wait! Don't question anybody yet.</i>

310
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:04,220
- I have a voice stress analyzer.
I'll be able to tell if he's lying or not.
- He hasn't said anything.

311
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:09,249
- You are a pathetic little frog, aren't you?
- You thought you could lose me, huh?
Well, you can all just relax.

312
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:14,231
Dirk'll take it from here.
Hey, hippie, you in charge?

313
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:18,929
<i>My name is Dirk. I'm a professional</i>
<i>bounty hunter. I was wondering</i>
<i>if I could have a word with you?</i>

314
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,201
- <i>Maybe this'll change your mind.</i>
<i>I got $200 here.</i>
- Two hundred dollars?

315
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:26,335
- They do use money on you planet, don't they?
- <i>I don't have any money</i>
<i>on me at the moment, um</i>...

316
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,345

<i>[Chattering Continues]</i>

318
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,253

- It doesn't say that.

319
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,311
[Grunts]
You're good.

320
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,858
Haven't worked out a day in my life.
You know why? Security cameras.
225.

321
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:46,125
His name is Chasen.
He's over at Cabin 14.

<i>[Dirk] Come on. There he is. Let's go!</i>

Don't let him get away!

Excuse me.

Excuse me.
Get outta my way!

Hello, Mr. Chasen!
[Panting]

330
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,860
Hi. Is this your necklace?
We found it in a museum.

331
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:24,061
Okay! Where's the diamond?
Hey! Hey, I'm talkin' to you!

332
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,168
Wow, that's a really deep trance.

333
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,911
Couldn't be deeper.

334
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,177
This man's dead.

335
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,125
Welcome back, Miss Mandeville.
Have a seat.
[Clears Throat]

336
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,188
You know the drill.

337
00:23:56,435 --> 00:24:00,337
I don't like this room.
Please, Miss Mandeville.

338
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:03,499
You said you had
something important to tell me...
something about a dead body.

339
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:09,411
And you said
you didn't wanna talk in my office.
I told you I'm claustrophobic.

340
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:14,544
What about another room?
All our interrogation rooms
are the same size, unfortunately:

341
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,553
No wet bars, noJacuzzis...

342
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,613
Please, just have a seat.

343
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:25,220
Now, you said you found a body...
your roommate's body.

344
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:31,665
This, um...
This is a real thing, right?

345
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:37,504
Not like, uh, stealin' the pen
from the bank?
Okay, good.

346
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,874
Tell me about it.
[Switch Clicks]

347
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,675
This is, uh, Lieutenant Disher.
I'm in Interrogation Room "D"...

348
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,875
talking with Jennie Mandeville...
again.

349
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:51,048
So, let's start from the beginning.
What was your roommate's name?
Tony.

350
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,989
Tony?
Tony what?
I don't know.

351
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:58,026
You don't know.
Male or female?

352
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,587
I think male.
You're not sure?

353
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,936
To tell you the truth,
I just brought him home
the day before.

354
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:13,974
Okay, um, let's move on.
So, um, you came home.

355
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:19,278
You found Tony, and you... what,
disposed of the body yourself?

356
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:24,779
<i>You realize that's a federal o</i>ff<i>ense?</i>
I couldn't take it, okay?

357
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,848
I couldn't just stand there looking at it.

358
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,955
Jennie, what did you do with the body?

359
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,555
I flushed it down the toilet.

360
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:44,100
- Was Tony a goldfish?
- A hamster.

361
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,075
A hamster.

362
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,412
Okay.

363
00:25:55,287 --> 00:26:00,088
[Stottlemeyer] Here's the coroner's report.
Victim's name: Danny Chasen.
It's probably an alias.

364
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:05,562
Victim was poisoned.
Somebody spiked his all-natural
barley tea with ammonia.

365
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,497
Was he... part of the heist?
Looks like it.

366
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:12,469
They found some hair samples
in that rolltop desk at the museum.
They match the body.

367
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:16,735
Okay, what about the diamond?
Still missing in action.
It wasn't on him or in the cabin.

368
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:21,472
We know he had a partner...
somebody who works at the museum.
It's probably still with him.

369
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:25,243
Uh, w-wait, wait.
So, the reward's still good, right?
I mean no one's claimed it.

370
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,684
Yes. As far as I know,
the offer is still good.

371
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,655
Ka-ching.
[Groans]
Can you make her stop saying that?

372
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:38,355
This is no longer a parlor game. A man is dead.
This is a homicide investigation now,
which means...

373
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:43,026
nobody is to withhold
any information
from anybody.

374
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:47,569
What?
You're lookin' at me?
Yes, I am, Miss Teeger.

375
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:52,133
[Scoffs]
<i>Did you write these?</i>
<i>Don't deny it. I know it was you!</i>

376
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,703
"How are things down under?
Hint, hint."

377
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:01,946
"Monk was right.
You should clean under the table."
You don't fool me for a second.

378
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,547
"It goes without saying...
don't forget to throw away
these little Post-its too."

379
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:09,116
Captain, she never cleans
under the table.
You are not the boss of me!

380
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,526
I think I am.
What makes you think
you're the boss of me?

381
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:13,530
If I was the boss of you,
you'd be fired!

382
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,532
Why do you think...
Whoa!
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! No!

383
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,038
Hey, separate, both of you.
Monk, over there.
Gladys, can I have a word with you, please?

384
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:30,877
Look.
Gladys, he's Monk.
Try to ignore him.

385
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,050
Can you ignore him?

386
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,750
No, I can't.
Just do the best you can.

387
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,827
[Jennie]
So you're not gonna arrest me?
No, not this time, miss.

388
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:56,271
But next time you feel
like confessing something,
you might wanna call a priest.

389
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,606
Will you, uh, escort
Miss Mandeville out?
No problem.

390
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,670
[Whistles]

391
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,215
Who's she?
Loony tune of the month.

392
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:09,447
Her name's, uh, Jennie Mandeville.
She keeps coming in here
and confessing to stuff.

393
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:14,424
What was it this time?
She comes in, same as yesterday...
she says she accidentally killed her roommate.

394
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:19,759
So I take her into the back room,
and I turned on the tape recorder.
Turns out her roommate was a hamster.

395
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,561
[Chuckles]
She didn't look unstable.

396
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:26,297
They never do.
Okay, can we get back to work now?
The missing diamond, remember?

397
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,032
Ka-ching!

398
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:32,406
"Ka-ching"?
She is putting
so much pressure on me.

399
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:36,208
She's obsessed
with this million dollar reward...
obsessed.

400
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:40,047
All right. Well, Adrian,
she's worried about money.
Now, I know a lot of people are.

401
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:45,920
Not me. When I was on the force,
I used to hate cashing my paycheck.
I still do.

402
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,654
To me, police work is...
it's like a higher calling,
like the priesthood.

403
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,289
But you know, Adrian,
even priests have to get paid.

404
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:58,825
But i-it brings up an interesting question,
something I would like to explore with you.

405
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:03,067
What would you do
if you had a million dollars?

406
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:09,080
Oh. Well, uh, I guess I'd...

407
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:14,551
I'd hire you full-time
and keep you on retainer, 24-7.

408
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,782
Maybe I'd buy you a house
right next to mine,

409
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:21,121
so I could just drop in anytime.

410
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:25,185
Heh. This is fun.
What would you do
with a million dollars?

411
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,823
Buy an island...

412
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:33,235
a desert island in... the middle of nowhere.

413
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:38,105
So, w-we would do our sessions
o-over the phone?

414
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:42,806
[Chuckles]
Well, you see...
see, this island, in my mind...

415
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,815
no phone service.

416
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:49,448
I guess I'd have to buy a boat.
Well, see, that's funny,

417
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:55,153
because the island
in-in my fantasy... no dock.

418
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:00,294
Well, may the best man win.

419
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:06,393
Excuse me! What are you doing?
Did you see that? There...

420
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:10,999
There was someone out there.
I'm going to have to report this.
It's... It's okay. It's okay.

421
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:15,444
It's just another detective
trying to find the diamond.

422
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,504
There's a whole bunch of them.

423
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:22,485
Yesterday they followed us
down the coast to that big
meditation center in Monterey.

424
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,853
Oh, I've been there.
It-It's just beautiful.

425
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:29,325
But this was years ago,
when Jennie Mandeville was still alive.

426
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:36,200
Jennie... Mandeville.
Jennie Mandeville.
Yeah, she owned the property.

427
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:41,705
There's this big plaque there
with her name on it.
That's right.

428
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,177
I remember.
I saw it.

429
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,203
What?

430
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,343
I just solved the case.
I think I know where that diamond is.

431
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:58,048
Ugh! I have to go.
We'll add 20 minutes on
to my next session.

432
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,590
Ah, A-Adrian.
Adrian, I'm sorry. I have a policy.

433
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:04,059
L-lf... If you leave early, I have to
charge you for the whole session.
[Groans]

434
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:06,119
Yeah.
Mmm. It's...

435
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,790
Uh...
Okay.

O-kay. O-kay?

Okay.

<i>I solved the case!</i>
<i>I know where the diamond is!</i>

441
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:36,891
What? So where is it?
It's at the police station.
It's been there the whole time!

442
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:39,953
It's been right under our nose.
Oh, my God.

<i>Who would do that to my car?</i>

What?
[No Audible Dialogue]

446
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,342
[Loudly]
What I meant was,

447
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,506
I didn't solve the case. I wish I had.
I'm completely stumped.
What are you talking about?

448
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,675
No. Wait.
What I really meant was,
I <i>did</i> solve the case.

449
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:04,518
The diamond is in the Philippines.
We gotta go to the airport,
fly to the Philippines.

450
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,524
Well, if we're gonna run,
just run. Run!

I'm with her.
You got to ride in the back.
That's the rule.

Ah, l-l-I'd prefer to sit up front.

It's true. It's one of his things.

478
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:55,192
- Well, here's one of my things:
Nobody rides in the front.
- I'm afraid it's not negotiable.

479
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:59,821
- Who's negotiatin'?
That's it. I'm outta here.
- No. W-W-W-Wait, wait, wait.

480
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:04,459

if you let him ride up front.
- Why? What's he gonna do?

481
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:09,370
Nothing. Nothing. He's got a cluster of,
uh, compulsions and phobias that manifest
themselves in a variety of... you know?

Oh, Disher.
Yeah, yeah.

We're bein' followed.
Don't tell anybody you saw us!

They locked the doors!
It says "Push"!

That way.

500

Lieutenant! Lieutenant, remember
the security guard that you arrested?
[Disher] Yeah.

501
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,316
Where did you interrogate him?
Right there... Room "B."

502
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:32,015
Ah! And the girl
that kept confessing,
Jennie Mandeville...

503
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:34,387
- Where did you take her?
- Uh, Room "A" then Room "D."

504
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:38,918
- So she was never in there?
It's gotta still be in there. It's in that room.
- What's in there? Monk, what's going on?

505
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:42,329
- Tell you later.
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
You cannot come in here.

506
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,233
My two friends are American citizens.
They have a right to be here.

507
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:48,466
Myself, I am on a temporary visa...
which I hope to extend.

508
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,975
- Are they with you?
- Only in the strictest,
most terrible sense of the word.

509
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,637
- I heard you tell your shrink
you solved the case.
- <i>[Natalie] Excuse me.</i>

510
00:36:57,014 --> 00:37:01,644
Nobody's going anywhere...
not until we know what he knows.
<i>[Key Clatters]</i>

511
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:06,747
All right, you just made a big mistake
my friend. I happen to be a police captain,
and this is an unlawful imprisonment.

512
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:10,817
Book him.
You're under arrest. Turn around.

513
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:17,394
[Disher]
Fine.
Give me your hands.

514
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:20,232
- Do you have your cuffs?
- In my office.

515
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,933
It's in there, isn't it?

516
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:27,068
The diamond...
it's in that very room.
What?

517
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:29,009
It is?
Uh, no, uh...
Get the door!

Shut up!
Everybody, shut up.

520
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,754
Everybody but Monk.
Monk, what's goin' on?

521
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:43,055
[Sighs]
Okay, here's what happened.

522
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:46,187
The woman who founded
the meditation center
was named Jennie Mandeville.

523
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:50,200
- Who, the confessor?
- No. No, no, no. The girl you met
was not the realJennie Mandeville.

524
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:55,035
<i>She got the name from a plaque</i>
<i>she saw up at the retreat.</i>

525
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,267
<i>She needed a fake name.</i>
<i>Maybe she liked the sound of it.</i>

526
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:03,280
- What was she doing up there?
- She went there to kill Danny Chasen,
the guy in the rolltop desk.

527
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:07,343
<i>It was probably her boyfriend's idea.</i>

528
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:11,081
<i>Jewel thieves are like children.</i>
<i>They hate to share.</i>

529
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:19,229
This is a very crowded room.
This is a very, very, very, very, very,
<i>very,</i> very, very, very, very...

530
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,164
Monk, Monk, Monk, Monk,
it's okay. It's okay.
Who was her boyfriend?

531
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,565
He was the security guard
that Randy arrested.

532
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,627
<i>He was thejewel thief.</i>
<i>He was the inside man.</i>

533
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,401
<i>The diamond was still in his pocket</i>
<i>when you were talking to him.</i>

534
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,671
<i>[Disher]</i>
<i>That's right. We brought him here</i>
<i>right from the museum.</i>

535
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:37,043
<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>I remember before the interrogation</i>
<i>he was chewing a big piece of gum.</i>

536
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:41,380
<i>But when I saw him after the interrogation,</i>
<i>the gum was gone.</i>

537
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:46,219
<i>He must have panicked in that room.</i>
<i>You had him on the drug charges.</i>
<i>He knew he was about to be arrested</i>...

538
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:50,852
<i>which of course meant he'd be searched</i>...
<i>so he hid the rock right there under the table.</i>

539
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:54,295
<i>[Stottlemeyer] With his chewing gum!</i>
<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>People do it in restaurants all the time.</i>

540
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:57,766
<i>I've written letters to my congressman</i>
<i>and to the editor. What can I do?</i>

541
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:01,271
He telephoned his girlfriend
from jail to tell her where
he stashed the diamond.

542
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,103
And that's why
she was coming in here
confessing to everything.

543
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,235
And why she was always
asking to switch rooms.
She was trying to get in there.

544
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:09,939
Oh... oh, okay.
I changed my mind.

545
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,710
There's seven of us,
and we're all adults.

546
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:17,015
- We'll just divide the money seven ways.
- No way. We were here first.

547
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,955
It's only fair we divide the proceeds.
We have been working in tandem.

548
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,993
We've not been working in tandem.
You've been chasing us.
That's not tandem.

549
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,928
Excuse me, could I say one thing?
You and you and you...

550
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,295
uh, you're breathing my air.

551
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,530
What about them?
They're breathing your air,
you're breathing his...

552
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:35,800
It's complicated.
Uh, but if these two dropped back, um...

553
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:39,036
Monk. Monk, it's okay.
I'll call for help.
Okay.

554
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,738
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Gladys.

555
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:46,249
N-N-N-No. Gladys! Gladys!
[Dirk]
No! Come on, lady! No!

Monk? Is that you?

557
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:53,046
[Natalie] Go home!
[Dirk] No, no, no!
Come on. Take the day off!

558
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:57,660
I told you to leave me alone.

559
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:02,261
Somebody barfed
in the bathroom!
[Clamoring]

560
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,665
Hey! Hey!

[Natalie]
There it is. No! No!
[Clamoring]

563
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:16,134
Okay. Fine. Look.

564
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:20,946
- I'm gonna clean under the table
just like you want, okay?
- No! No!

565
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:24,351
- Over! Clean over the table!
- [Mouthing Words]

566
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,932
[Quietly]
I can't look.

567
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,525
Ka-ching.

568
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,763
Oh, God.

<i>She came in again late last night,</i>
<i>said she has something to confess to.</i>

572
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,884
This time we got
a real confession out of her.
Okay, listen to this:

573
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,795
"Gladys Menchen, who was employed
by a local cleaning service
for the last 22 years,

574
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:12,199
will be flown to London on a private jet
to pick up her reward."
[Laughs]

575
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:17,536
"Miss Menchen found the stolen gem
while cleaning <i>under</i> a table
in an interrogation room."

576
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:20,042
What? You're blaming me?
<i>Under</i> a table.

577
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,704
Why would they even want it back?
There's gum all over it.

578
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:27,342
I've got some good news...
sort of a consolation prize.
I talked to the commissioner.

579
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,943
He's gonna put you
under contract.
Really?

580
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,011
Put you on a retainer.

581
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:37,391
He has guaranteed you 16 homicides
a year for the next two years.

582
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:41,192
[Monk]
Sixteen a year? Well, what hap...
What about after that?

583
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:46,259
Well, we'll have to take it
one year at a time. We'll see.
