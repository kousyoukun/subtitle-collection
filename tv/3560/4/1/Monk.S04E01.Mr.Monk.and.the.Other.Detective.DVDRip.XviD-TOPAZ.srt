1
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,243
Harold. You're early.

2
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:19,251
- I know.
I'm picking something up.
- Where's Peggy?

3
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,947
Thought you two
were joined at the hip.

4
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:57,183
Yes?
How's it going, Harold?

5
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,953
- I'm in. I'm doing it.
- Friendly reminder-

6
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:01,960
Don't be a hero.

7
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,121
We hear a police siren,
Peggy's dead.

8
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:07,098
I-is she okay?
Can I talk to her?
Just hurry up.

9
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:10,000
Please, let me talk to her-
Hel- Let me- Hello?

10
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,938
Backseat.

11
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,875
Let her go.
You said you would.

12
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,344
Pleasure doing business with you.
Thanks for the car, Harold.

13
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,278
Come here, Peggy.
<i>Harold!</i>

14
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:58,340
- Everything all right?
- Paul, I'm okay.
No problem.

15
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,510
- Get out of the car!
- Go!

16
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,023
Both of you! Do it!

17
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,993
Okay.

18
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:13,698
Happy Halloween, man.
J-Just relax.

19
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,165
- <i>Vic! What did you do?</i>
- No choice. Him or me.

20
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,297
- We could have just driven off. Get in the car.
- I didn't see anything!

21
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,841
- Don't move the car. I'm not done.
- Neither did Peggy.

22
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,207
I'm not done.

23
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,838
No!

24
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,265
Mr. Monk, are you okay?
Everybody's waiting.

25
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,801
It's... over there.
What?

26
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,836
Dog-You know.

27
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,370
Dog... doo.

28
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,705
Did you step in it?

29
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,711
If I stepped in it,
I'd be in that ambulance
right now...

30
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:09,304
on my way
to the emergency room,
wouldn't I?

31
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,442
Praying for the sweet release
that only death can bring.

32
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,555
So, Monk, what do you think?
Who are we looking for?

33
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:20,457
Ah, I'd say it's a terrier, a Yorkie,
maybe a chihuahua.

34
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,188
Probably miles away by now.
We'll never catch him.

35
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:28,264
- He can't concentrate
because of the-
- 'Cause of the what?

36
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,633
The dog poo.

37
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,702
Lieutenant.

38
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,208
Clean that up for me,
would you?

39
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,682
Thanks.

40
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,844
Sergeant.
Yes, sir.

41
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,279
Clean that up.

42
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,650
No, don't.

43
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,902
Sir, you can't park there.

44
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,530
It's all right.
It's okay.
I'm a detective.

45
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,972
I'm a detective.
One second.
Here we go.

46
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,705
Hold that?

47
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,577
I got it.
I usually keep it right-

48
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,310
Um- Oh! I got it.
Here we go.

49
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,251
Marty Eels.
Private Investigator.

50
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,915
I'm here to save your butts.
Captain!

51
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,151
Captain Stottlemeyer!

52
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,625
Oh, hell.
Who's that?

53
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,220
Marty Eels.
He's a private investigator.

54
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:34,357
Nickel-and-dime stuff.
Divorces, insurance fraud.

55
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,425
He's a professional
pain in the ass.

56
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,436
Hey, Captain. Captain,
you're lookin' great.

57
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,699
You're losin' weight
or your shirts are getting bigger.

58
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:44,209
Marty. I heard the D.A.
pulled your license.

59
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,711
No, no, no. That was
just a temporary suspension.

60
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,111
No, no, no.
That was just a little
misunderstanding.

61
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,548
A misunderstanding?
That's all ancient history anyway.

62
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,881
So I was just riding around
in the neighborhood,

63
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:57,389
and I heard a call go out
on the police scanner-
Look, Marty. I'm busy.

64
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,426
Yeah, that's why I thought
I'd come down here
and lend a hand.

65
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,485
So what do we got?
The jewelry store was robbed, huh?
Well, that's obvious.

66
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,226
We got a- a dead rent-a-cop
and a missing store manager,
so let me guess.

67
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,235
You're thinking
the store manager doing it-
Yeah. Something like that.

68
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,272
Yeah, so let me look around, huh?
An extra pair of eyes can't hurt.

69
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,274
And who knows,
I could see something
you guys are missing.

70
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:19,277
We're not missing anything, Mr. Eels.
We've got a C.S.I. team here.

71
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,575
And, uh, see that man
over there?

72
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:25,105
<i>It's Adrian Monk.</i>
<i>I think we're in pretty good hands.</i>

73
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,278
Captain. Monk says I can't
just throw this away.

74
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,152
I gotta take it
like a mile away and bury it.

75
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,317
Could I see that?
Yeah.

76
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,586
You can't throw this away.
This-This is evidence.

77
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,791
This is fresh. Mmm!

78
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,135
I'd say this is less than
90 minutes old.

79
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,801
Marty-
But isn't that when you said
all this was probably going down?

80
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,845
<i>The dog could've</i>
<i>belonged to the victim...</i>

81
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,846
or to one of the perps.

82
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:59,146
I think this is important.
Monk was gonna
throw this away.

83
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,186
Um-

84
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,449
You know,
he might be right.

85
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,151
Let's, uh, book that
into evidence.

86
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,853
Yes, sir.
Captain. Look.

87
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,822
<i>Did that store manager</i>
<i>live in Oakland?</i>

88
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,835
Yeah.
How'd you know that?

89
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,929
That's his dog.
That's from Oakland.

90
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,566
You can see the blue license
on its collar.

91
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,677
What, you can see that
from here?

92
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:32,013
Little something I call
attention to detail, but-

93
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,143
Go get the dog.

94
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,552
Adrian Monk,
Natalie Teeger.
This is Marty Eels.

95
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,594
He's a private investigator.
Hey, how you doing?
How you doing?

96
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,687
I hear good things.
Good things.

97
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:48,427
Don't worry. I'm not competition.
I'm just here to help.
Can I have one of those?

98
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,171
So, what do we got?

99
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:55,503
Captain, I don't think
the manager did this.

100
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,510
For one thing,
he didn't lock the door
behind him.

101
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,877
Plus, I noticed
some more blood by the curb.

102
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,882
I think there was
a second shooting.

103
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,885
Yeah, he could be right.
Very good. Nicely done.
Nicely done.

104
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,887
<i>Captain!</i>

105
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:12,118
He's right.
Peggy belongs
to the store manager,

106
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,216
Harold Gumbal,
Geary Street, Oakland.

107
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:19,026
Hmm.
You know, if the manager
was robbing his own store,

108
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,033
he wouldn't bring
his dog along.
Or leave him behind.

109
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:25,298
No, the manager is not the guy.
No, that's right.
The manager is not the guy.

110
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,033
Here's what-
Here's what happened!
Here's what happened!

111
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:30,075
This dog was a hostage.

112
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:33,168
The manager was being forced
to rob his store.

113
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,840
Something went wrong,
and they shot the guard.

114
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,218
Excuse me.

115
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,288
What the hell is he doing?

116
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:55,195
Captain-
Well, he did spot the dog's
license from a block away.

117
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,795
Okay. They drove off
in Gumbal's car.

118
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,272
They headed south.
They're gonna dump it
as soon as they can.

119
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,673
We're already checking
the airport.
That's a waste of time.

120
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,905
They would never go there.
There's too much security.

121
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,743
- Try the train station.
- Train station.

122
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,306
<i>Yeah. Try, um, San Bruno...</i>

123
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,319
or Millbrae.

124
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,652
<i>They probably panicked</i>
<i>when they shot the guard.</i>

125
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:22,717
Maybe they dropped the gun
or some bloody clothes
somewhere nearby.

126
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,729
What are you doing there?
What-

127
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,860
This dog has been
sniffing around a sewer
recently.

128
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,465
See these sewer grates
around here?

129
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,671
The perps might have
stuffed something
down in there,

130
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,374
and maybe this dog
saw them do it.

131
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,509
You gotta be kidding.
He's kidding, right?
He's joking.

132
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,520
The man is joking.

133
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,715
Just take two minutes
to check it.

134
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,326
<i>Officer, take a look</i>
<i>in that sewer grate.</i>

135
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,328
Captain.

136
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,523
From smelling a dog,
that's impossible.

137
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,800
Captain! There was stuff
down the drain just like he said.

138
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:20,174
No. No, Mom.
I wasn't on the news.

139
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,278
Because there were
no reporters there yet.

140
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,348
Mm-hmm. I found a lot of clues.

141
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:30,156
I found three or four big clues.
Cap- Captain
was very impressed with me.

142
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,687
He- He just walked in.
He'll tell ya.
One second.

143
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:37,964
Captain, it's my mother.
Tell her-Tell her how good I was
on the crime scene.

144
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:44,233
Uh, Mrs. Eels? Hi.

145
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,642
Uh, yeah.
Marty did great.
You'd be very proud of him.

146
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,408
He's a first-rate detective.

147
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,474
I look forward
to meeting you, too, ma'am.
Okay. Bye-bye.

148
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,688
Uh, what were those beeps?
Oh, she was at work.

149
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,988
She works for Pacific Global Airlines.
She's a- She's a quality control operator.

150
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,029
Come in.
Come- Come on in.
Sit down. Sit down.

151
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:08,430
Here, Natalie. Come sit down.
Come sit down.
Make yourself at home.

152
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,402
- Monk, sit. Sit anywhere.
- That's okay. I'm not fine.

153
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,696
Did he just say he's not fine?
Yeah.

154
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,040
So, Captain,
am I on the case, or what?

155
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:22,205
- <i>First I have to ask you</i>
<i>a couple of questions.</i>
- Yeah. Yeah.

156
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,541
Where were you
yesterday morning
at 8:00?

157
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,951
You mean when the robbery
was happening?
<i>Yeah.</i>

158
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,455
You guys think
I had something to do with that?

159
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,493
Why, because you
can't keep up with me
on a crime scene?

160
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,028
<i>Where were you, Marty?</i>

161
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,691
I was at the hospital.
St. Andrews.

162
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,633
- They thought I had
a concussion.
- What happened?

163
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,764
Well-
That's kind of embarrassing.

164
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,832
I, um- I got hit very hard
by a client.

165
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,105
Hit me very hard.

166
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,443
Yeah. Um-

167
00:11:55,514 --> 00:12:00,110
I was, um, supposed to
follow his wife
and take pictures.

168
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,822
Whoa.
She was cheating on him.

169
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,224
<i>No. No. That- That's him.</i>

170
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,320
That's my client.

171
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,298
<i>You burst in to take a picture</i>
<i>of a man in bed with his own wife?</i>

172
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:18,200
Yes, I did.
I made a mistake.
I'm human.

173
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:23,269
So, the bottom line is
I was at the hospital
when the jewelry thing was happening.

174
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,310
- You can call them.
- We will.

175
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:28,869
<i>Why is it so hard for you guys</i>
<i>to believe that I'm just this good?</i>

176
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:33,078
<i>Because, Marty, you were</i>
<i>never this good before.</i>
<i>In fact, you sort of sucked.</i>

177
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:37,248
Well, I was-
I been teaching myself.
I been- I learned how to focus.

178
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,850
<i>And that's really the secret, focus.</i>
<i>Am I right about the focus thing?</i>

179
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,190
Bay Area Center
Continuing Education.

180
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,231
Is that a correspondence school?

181
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,391
It's fully accredited.

182
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,368
What school
did you go to?
Berkeley.

183
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,371
That's a good school.

184
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,498
I believe
they're fully accredited too.

185
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,042
Yeah. Yeah,
they're fully accredited.

186
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,136
So, Captain,
am I on the case or what?

187
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,704
I mean, put- put me in, Coach!

188
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,217
I found- I found the ski masks,
didn't I?

189
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,652
Look, Marty,
even if I wanted to,

190
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,657
<i>I just don't have the budget</i>
<i>to hire two consultants.</i>

191
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,989
I tell you what.
I tell you what.

192
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,154
You don't have to
pay me dime one
unless I get some results.

193
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,222
So this costs you nothing.
Captain, could I-

194
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,101
You can't hire this guy.

195
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,147
He did find the ski masks.
By smelling a dog.

196
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,182
It's not possible.

197
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:41,049
Look, Monk, sometimes
when you're picking up clues,

198
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,111
it seems like magic to me.

199
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,214
I don't know
how you do it.

200
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,226
Maybe he's doing something
that you don't understand.

201
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,592
I think he's cheating.
He's a cheater.

202
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,632
- Disher.
- This isn't the fourth grade, Monk.

203
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,667
He's cheating!
How?

204
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,759
How?

205
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,771
I don't know.

206
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,865
We just found
the store manager's car.
Guess where it was.

207
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:09,711
- Your train station?
- In San Bruno. Outstanding.

208
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,216
You called it, Marty.
<i>Let's check it out.</i>

209
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,878
Marty, come here.
You ride with me.

210
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,727
He's cheating.

211
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,490
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me.
Uh, go ahead.

212
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,492
No, no. After you.

213
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,528
Please.

214
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,692
It's pretty weird, huh?
Maybe we should send
one of them home.

215
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,931
Yeah, but which one?

216
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:12,603
<i>Marty Eels.</i>
<i>E-E-L-S, like the fish.</i>

217
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,579
He's always wanted
to be a detective.

218
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:19,482
He used to stay up late
reading Hardy Boys stories
under the cover.

219
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,747
So your son
is helping Adrian Monk?

220
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,791
Who's helping who?
That's the question.

221
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:36,289
I love that.
Love the thing
you do with your hands.

222
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,359
It's very old-school.
Thank you.

223
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,476
Wha-What are you doing?

224
00:15:56,922 --> 00:16:00,085
Mud. You can tell
where the car has been.

225
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,889
From tasting it?

226
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,953
He's tasting the mud.
Does that work?

227
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,021
No! It's just nuts!

228
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,474
Captain, how tall
was the store manager?

229
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,670
Uh-
Uh, 5'10",
according to his driver's license.

230
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,181
<i>Hmm.</i>

231
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,183
Somebody else
was driving this car,

232
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:29,243
because that chair's been adjusted
for somebody 5'11".

233
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,585
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

234
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,091
It's impossible to know that.

235
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,253
Seat adjustments
are not that exact.

236
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,231
Should I write down 5'11"?

237
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:44,360
Uh-
I don't know. Yes.
In pencil.

238
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,334
Ah.
Here we go.

239
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,605
This map was used recently.

240
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,740
That means
that the driver was not familiar
with this particular area.

241
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,284
I- I- I had that one.
You didn't say anything.

242
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,547
I was waiting my turn.

243
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,612
I had that one. Captain-

244
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,389
He's cheating.
He's a cheater.

245
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,451
<i>He saw me looking.</i>

246
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,600
And...

247
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,262
this car was driven
on Highway 47.

248
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,966
And... how do you
happen to know that?

249
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,444
It's all in the details, Captain.
See the, um- the dead bugs
on the windshield?

250
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,247
This...

251
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:35,878
is a gray bantam-wing mosquito,
which are most common where?

252
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:39,617
Anybody? Walter Creek reservoir.

253
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:43,422
In Livingston.
Highway 47. That's fantastic.

254
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,225
Bantam-wing mosquito.

255
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,892
Gentlemen, let's pop the trunk.
Monk.

256
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,632
This blood is still fresh.

257
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:00,041
Yes, it is.
Good for you.

258
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:03,240
Write that down.
One for Monk.

259
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:07,342
All right. Gumbal was
dragged out of the car...

260
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,945
and into these woods.

261
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,117
Okeydoke. Here we go.

262
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,892
These leaves
were recently crushed.

263
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,160
I'm 1/16th Cherokee.

264
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,297
Cool.
Thought he might be.

265
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,348
Now what's he doing?

266
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,384
I can't look.

267
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,385
Oh, he's using a divining rod.

268
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,047
The Indians used to use them.
He's 1/16th Cherokee.

269
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,718
Oh, that's my boy.
Can everybody see okay?

270
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,227
Take lots of pictures.
Film is cheap.

271
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,377
Think I found
the store manager.

272
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:09,676
Stay back! Get outta here!

273
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:12,581
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back off. Back off.

274
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,051
<i>He was shot in the chest.</i>

275
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,454
Call the coroner's office.
Get the crime scene guys up here.
And get me a 20-foot perimeter now!

276
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,050
Let's go! You heard the man.
Take 10 steps back!
Let's go!

277
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:25,221
Get out of here!
Baker, come on!
Move these guys down.

278
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,356
That's interesting.
What?

279
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,626
You don't see that?

280
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,903
Look at his arms.
That is an unnatural position.

281
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,942
Unnatural?

282
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,478
I think he was trying
to tell us something.

283
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,878
With his dying breath,
he was trying to
send us a message.

284
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,884
With his dying breath.

285
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:52,720
He was trying to tell us
the name of the man
who killed him. Look.

286
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:57,228
<i>See, he's pointing to his watch.</i>

287
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,230
No, he's not.

288
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:04,565
Captain, are there any perps
who'd do a job like this
by the name of... Casio?

289
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,365
Casio?

290
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,803
Lefty.
Captain.

291
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:12,602
- Dial.
- Eddie Dial.

292
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,705
<i>He just did seven years</i>
<i>in Folsom for kidnapping</i>
<i>and bank robbery.</i>

293
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,773
He just made parole.

294
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,011
Well, let's check him out.
Yes, sir.

295
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,421
Baker!
Johnson!

296
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,670
Mom, have you seen my camera?

297
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,932
Mm-mmm.
Did you check your jacket?

298
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,975
What about your pockets?
Yes, I looked everywhere.

299
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:47,102
I haven't seen it, honey.
Why don't you ask Mr. Monk
to help you?

300
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,845
Please, Mr. Monk.
It has all my pictures in it
from my school trip.

301
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,785
I was the official photographer
and if I lose it,
I'm going to get an incomplete.

302
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,845
When did you see it last?

303
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,788
I saw it yesterday
in the living room.

304
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:16,140
<i>That plant has been</i>
<i>moved recently.</i>

305
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,768
That's right.
How did you know?

306
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,711
Well, normally,
they lean toward the sun.

307
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,874
This one is leaning
the other way.

308
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,754
Hello.

309
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,484
Mr. Monk, thank you so much.
You're the best.
Isn't he the best?

310
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,722
There's no one better.
You really are amazing.

311
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,391
<i>Oh. Wait.</i>

312
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,668
When did you water this?

313
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,671
Oh, uh, this morning.

314
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,867
<i>Well, the camera</i>
<i>could not have been back there</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

315
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,933
It would have gotten wet.

316
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,710
Thanks for trying, Julie.

317
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,774
My mom put me up to this.

318
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,026
Mr. Monk,
you really are amazing.

319
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,395
You're probably
the best in the world.

320
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,402
And you're right about
this Marty character.
He's cheating.

321
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,405
I don't know.
He is.
Hello?

322
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,532
Yes, sir.

323
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,706
Really?

324
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,273
Okay, okay. We're on our way.

325
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,284
They just caught one of the killers.
They're questioning him now.

326
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,877
Julie, we'll be back soon,
honey.

327
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,582
Natalie.

328
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,251
It's not Eddie Dial, is it?

329
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,194
Yeah.

330
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:54,371
<i>We found the manager's wallet...</i>
<i>in your motel room, Eddie.</i>

331
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,941
It's over.
We own you.

332
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,307
Look, man, I didn't hurt
anybody, okay?

333
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,404
I didn't even
have a gun.

334
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,416
Well, two people are dead,
Edward.

335
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,975
Who did the shooting?

336
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,819
I'm willing to bet you
it was that guy.
Blanchard, Victor P.

337
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,882
The two of you were seen together
last weekend.

338
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,723
Where is he, Eddie?
I don't know!

339
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:21,254
Captain.
May I?

340
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,669
Where's your-
Where's your partner,
Eddie?

341
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,184
I don't know.

342
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,347
Hmm. He's telling the truth.
He- He doesn't know.

343
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,756
- Do you have a map?
- He's like a human lie detector.

344
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:51,159
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it either.

345
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:54,960
Well, he's doing it.
Well, I still don't believe it.

346
00:23:55,033 --> 00:24:00,767
What you see happening
in the next room,
it's impossible. It's just-

347
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:07,072
What-What's this?
Stuff we found in Eddie's motel room,

348
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,705
including a pair of tickets
to Costa Rica.

349
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,715
<i>Did you guys find the jewels?</i>

350
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,445
No, not yet.
Marty'll find them.

351
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:17,181
All righty. Now then, Eddie,

352
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,189
where did you hide the jewels?

353
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,851
Was it-Was it here?

354
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,861
No. Um...

355
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,954
Was it here?

356
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:30,957
No.
Uh, how about here?

357
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,504
Ah. Getting warmer.

358
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,563
<i>Did you hide them here, Eddie?</i>

359
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,474
Ah. Yes.

360
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,876
They're, uh-
They're in the state park.

361
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,848
Get outta here.

362
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:48,408
<i>I know this area.</i>
<i>There's a water tower</i>
<i>right here.</i>

363
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,546
Oh. Oh.

364
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:54,752
Did you, uh- Did you hide them
near the water tower, Eddie?

365
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,329
Hmm! Bingo!

366
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:01,365
Yes!

367
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,902
Call Dunlop in the Parks Department.
Tell him to meet us there.

368
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,412
And tell him
to bring some shovels.
Sir.

369
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,472
I don't know how the hell
I'm gonna write this up.

370
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,848
Marty.
Oh, Mr. Monk.

371
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,911
Why don't you guys go ahead.
I'll meet you there.

372
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:29,284
This is District.
Give me two black-and-whites
down at the state park right now.

373
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,989
He's cheating!
What, Monk?
How is he cheating?

374
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,998
We've got a suspect
who just confessed.

375
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,591
He found the car.
He found the body.

376
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,661
He is solving this case
single-handedly.
By cheating!

377
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,009
Natalie, what do you think?
I believe my boss.

378
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:48,443
Anyway, we'd better go.
Should we take one car or two?

379
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:51,448
Monk,
why don't you stay here?

380
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,550
We're gonna let Marty
take this one.

381
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,215
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You're <i>firing</i> him?
No! No.

382
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,317
Um, it's just that Marty
seems to be in a zone.

383
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,362
He's got a handle
on this one.

384
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,659
You get the next one,
okay?

385
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,299
I'll call you. I gotta go.

386
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,913
<i>So they found the jewels.</i>

387
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,973
Right where Marty
said they'd be.

388
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,042
Of course.

389
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:31,987
<i>And what, then they-</i>
<i>They asked you to step aside?</i>

390
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,321
They said Marty was on a roll.

391
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:39,259
Guess they didn't want me
to cramp his style.

392
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,929
Well, A-Adrian, I-I'm sure
that this is all just temporary.

393
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,666
Maybe he really is
better than me.

394
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,439
Yeah, well,
would that be so terrible?

395
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:58,448
I mean, if <i>you</i>
weren't number one.

396
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,246
An ex-cop I know...

397
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,990
teaches criminal justice
at Fulton College.

398
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,323
He offered me a job
last year.

399
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,565
Maybe I'll give him
a call.

400
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,534
All right.
So you're just giving up.
Okay.

401
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:21,231
No, Adrian, I'm not suggesting
that you just give up.

402
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,571
I'm saying to you
that there is always someone
ahead of you.

403
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,168
This is the human condition.
For instance,

404
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:30,009
there's a new psychiatrist
here in town,
name of Lowenstern.

405
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:35,917
Now, I know that there is
no way that I will ever be
as-as-well, as good as he is.

406
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,217
I know this.
I accept it.

407
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,223
He's better than you?

408
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,124
He's brilliant.
Nominated for a Nobel Prize.

409
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:46,686
But the point is
you think that you might
enjoy teaching.

410
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:50,166
I don't know.
Tell-Tell me more
about this Lowenstern.

411
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:53,363
Lowenstern.
I could introduce you.
Office is right across the street.

412
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,407
He charges $400 an hour.

413
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,345
So wh-where were we?

414
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,438
Mmm. Okay.

415
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:13,548
Oh. Good morning, boss.
They were out of the round sponges.

416
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,593
Don't panic.
I'll pick some up
on the way home.

417
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,756
Don't worry about the groceries.
You're driving me to Fulton College.
I have an appointment.

418
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,595
You mean now?
11:00. I'm meeting the dean.

419
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,602
You're just gonna quit,
just like that?

420
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,729
I think I would make
a very good teacher.

421
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,797
Oh, Mr. Monk,
you'd make a <i>terrible</i> teacher!

422
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,843
It would take you four weeks
to correct one paper.

423
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,845
You're a detective.
You're a great detective.

424
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,939
- Are you gonna
drive me or not?
- No. No, I'm not.

425
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,383
Your feelings are hurt,
and you're just not
thinking straight.

426
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,478
Fine. Fine.
I'll take a taxi.

427
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,546
<i>You're</i> gonna take a taxi.

428
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,750
Do you know what people do
in taxis?

429
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,794
Fine! Fine.
I will drive myself.

430
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,795
I'll rent a car.

431
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:55,128
See? I am dialing
the number.

432
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,168
I'm not bluffing.

433
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:00,671
Do you even <i>have</i>
a driver's license?
Yes, I have a license.

434
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,334
Okay, this is it.
This is the last digit.

435
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,536
I have dialed the number.
It is ringing.

436
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:09,079
Thank you for calling
Cannon Rent-a-Car.

437
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,547
This call may be monitored
for quality purposes.

438
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,414
- I am on hold.
- Mr. Monk-

439
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,250
Fulton College
is 100 miles away.

440
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:21,588
It is up the interstate.
It's over a bridge.

441
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,822
You know, I have a blindfold
for going over bridges.

442
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:27,057
But you'll be driving.

443
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,999
Good point.
I think I can make it.

444
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:32,662
I'll just sort of peek underneath.

445
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:36,036
I'm not gonna let you drive.
You've never driven over
a bridge in your life.

446
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,372
What choice do I have?
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

447
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,412
Yes?

448
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,347
My daughter goes to Fulton College.
You don't have to take the bridge.

449
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,816
You can take the causeway
all the way up.

450
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,877
You... could hear us?

451
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:53,412
Yes, sir.
I'm a quality control operator.
I'm monitoring the call.

452
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,818
I- I was on hold.

453
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:59,830
Yes, sir. We start listening
as soon as you're connected.

454
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,832
You wouldn't believe
the things I hear.

455
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,425
People fooling around.
People arguing.

456
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,493
I could write a book about it.

457
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,742
You could hear me...

458
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,005
while I was on hold?

459
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,205
That's right.

460
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,516
Hey! Monk!

461
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,562
What a nice surprise.

462
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:33,597
This guy's from
<i>San Francisco</i> magazine.

463
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:37,192
I'm one of the 10 most
eligible bachelors in the city.
Can you believe it?

464
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:40,066
- Marty, we need to talk.
- Not a good time, Nat.

465
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:42,163
Did you just call me Nat?

466
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,731
Hey, hey, get one
with me and Monk.
No.

467
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,744
No, no, this is good.
It's like a summit
of great minds.

468
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:50,076
Philip Marlowe
meets Sherlock Holmes.

469
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:56,680
It's about your mother, a little something
she might have overheard while at work.

470
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:03,193
Can't-The music's too loud.
I can't hear. Take a five.
Take a five.

471
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:08,261
<i>We know how you did it, Marty.</i>

472
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,928
- We figured it out.
- How I did what?

473
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,938
Didn't your mother ever tell you
that cheaters never win?

474
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,031
Actually,
it was your mother's idea.

475
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,668
She works for
Pacific Global Airlines, doesn't she,

476
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:22,611
in the quality control department?

477
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,875
Yeah, so?

478
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,474
This call may be monitored
for quality purposes.

479
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,486
<i>Here's what happened.</i>

480
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:33,650
<i>After the murders,</i>
<i>Blanchard and Dial</i>
<i>went back to their motel room,</i>

481
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:38,822
<i>counted their jewels,</i>
<i>and then they called the airlines</i>
<i>to buy plane tickets to Costa Rica.</i>

482
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,024
<i>They were put on hold.</i>

483
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,966
<i>What they didn't know</i>
<i>was that your mother...</i>

484
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:48,233
<i>was already on the line</i>
<i>monitoring their call.</i>

485
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,570
<i>They must have been on hold</i>
<i>for quite a while,</i>

486
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:53,611
<i>because they talked about everything-</i>
<i>who they killed,</i>

487
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:57,671
<i>where they dumped the car,</i>
<i>even where they hid the masks.</i>

488
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,683
<i>But she didn't call the police.</i>

489
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:03,744
<i>She called you and told you</i>
<i>everything you needed to know</i>
<i>to solve the case.</i>

490
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,187
Or at least pretend
to solve it.

491
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,952
You're a very smart man.

492
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,424
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>He's the real thing.</i>

493
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,434
Yep.

494
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:21,199
Course, you realize
you have no proof
for any of this.

495
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,435
Don't airlines record
phone conversations?

496
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:27,205
Yes, Nat.
I believe they do.

497
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,769
Yes, they certainly do.
But those conversations...

498
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,509
have a way of being
accidentally erased.

499
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,710
So it's really
your word against mine.

500
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:39,279
And who do you think
everyone's gonna believe?

501
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:42,690
The amazing Marty Eels
or, uh...

502
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,363
yesterday's news?

503
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,194
Phone's been ringin'
off the hook.

504
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,499
Cases, cases, cases.

505
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:57,765
Would you mind?

506
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,912
Ah-

507
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,681
Hey. Eels Investigations.

508
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,691
Hey, Marty.

509
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,159
I got a proposition for you.
Who's this?

510
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:20,664
My name's Vic. We never met.
I think you know my partner,
though, Eddie Dial.

511
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:23,257
In fact, you and your friends
arrested him yesterday.

512
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,269
How did you get this number?
This is my private line.

513
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:29,898
It's the first number
on your mother's speed dial.
My mother?

514
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:32,875
Did you really think
you could screw with me
and get away with it?

515
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:36,072
Where is she?
I just left her. She's fine.

516
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,081
For now.

517
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:40,617
If you want to see her again,
listen carefully.

518
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:44,678
- The jewels belong to me.
I want them back.
- The jewels?

519
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,418
Bring them to the Dunn Street
bus terminal by 8:00.

520
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:50,290
Put them in locker 240
on the upper level.
I got a spare key.

521
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,228
Wait a minute!
Wait, wait, wait!
I can't get to the jewels.

522
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:56,289
They're locked up.
They're in evidence.
You can do it, Marty.

523
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,063
I been reading all about you.
You're the flavor of the month.

524
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,105
Just tell them you want to
examine the evidence.

525
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:05,108
Tell them
you want to use it to set a trap.
I don't care what you tell them.

526
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,269
Just get 'em back.

527
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,279
Oh, and Marty.
What?

528
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,372
No cops. Come alone.

529
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,747
Remember,
if anything happens to me,

530
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:17,049
your mother's dead
by 8:20.

531
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:19,555
Wait!

532
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,185
<i>Mr. Monk!</i>

533
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:26,560
Mr. Monk, wait!
Wait, Mr. Monk!

534
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,565
Mr. Monk, wait!

535
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,567
Wait, wait.
It's Vic Blanchard.

536
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:33,729
- He just called.
He's got my mother.
- I gotta call the captain.

537
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,774
No, no! No! No cops!
He said no cops,
or he'd kill her.

538
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,866
Mr. Monk, please.
You gotta help me.

539
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:42,606
You were right.
I don't know what I'm doing!
I don't.

540
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:46,306
Let's go.

541
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,625
Let's just go over this
one more time.

542
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:58,788
Can you think of anything else
he might have said on the phone?
No cops!

543
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:01,423
<i>He said if he even</i>
<i>smells a cop, she's dead.</i>

544
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,024
My gosh. Marty, for the 10th time,
no one's calling the cops!

545
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:07,538
She's right. Marty, look.
We know where he's gonna be at 8:00.

546
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:11,371
If we can find your mother
before that time,
the cops can pick him up then.

547
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,706
- I know. I know. I-
- Ah! Natalie.

548
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,645
I got it. I'm on it!
It's all over the top.

549
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,012
Marty, can you just please
sit on the couch, all right?

550
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,051
You're making Mr. Monk
very nervous.

551
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,351
All right, one more time.
The kidnapper said
he'd just left her, right?

552
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:28,392
So she can't be too far
from where he made
that phone call.

553
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,826
Do you remember anything else
about the phone call?

554
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,387
- Like what?
- Like wh- Like anything.

555
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,626
Noises in the background.

556
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,862
- I don't know!
- He doesn't know.

557
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:42,167
This wasn't even my idea.
My mother made me do this.

558
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,209
<i>She forced me into it.</i>
<i>She said it was the only way</i>
<i>a loser like me...</i>

559
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,506
was ever gonna be able
to solve a real crime.

560
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:51,514
She sounds delightful.
That's my mother. Where do you get off
talking about somebody's mother?

561
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:53,516
Okay, Marty-
What's wrong with you?

562
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:57,384
Marty, Marty, Marty. Concentrate.
Can you please just try to think?

563
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,548
You must have heard something.

564
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,487
Yeah. Uh-

565
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,997
An ocean. He-

566
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:11,398
- I think he was near an ocean.
- There you go.

567
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:15,428
And there was, um...
a ringing like- like a clang.

568
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,474
Clang.

569
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,601
With a sound before it. Um-

570
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,668
It was like a thud...

571
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,680
clang.

572
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,682
Thud! Clang!

573
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,877
Okay. Give me a minute.

574
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,886
Thud, clang!

575
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:32,047
Yeah, Marty.
I got it. Thud, clang.

576
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,182
Let me think.

577
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,734
Thud, clang.
<i>Okay.</i>

578
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:46,702
Oh, my God, she's here!
She's here, she's here!
Mom. Mom!

579
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,001
No, Marty, don't-
Don't get separated!

580
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:51,132
Mom!
Stay with the group!

581
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:55,407
Marty, I want you to focus.
Can you focus?

582
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:59,882
All right, the caller
said that she would be dead
by 8:20, was it?

583
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:02,943
Why 8:20?
Why not 8:00 or 8:30?

584
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,456
- 8:20.
- Think!

585
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,617
I'm thinking.
Well, think harder!

586
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:11,890
Why don't you think?
Hey, I'm not the great big
famous detective.

587
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:14,523
Well, you were two hours ago!
Natalie!

588
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,533
What?

589
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,592
- 8:20.
- What's 8:20?

590
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,798
High tide.

591
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:44,217
<i>Mom! Mom!</i>

592
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,354
That's gotta be it.

593
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,957
- <i>Go, Marty. Go!</i>
- Come on. Run. Move!

594
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:54,402
<i>I'll wait out here.</i>
<i>I got your back!</i>

595
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,973
Mom! Mom!

596
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,040
Mom! Mom!

597
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,277
Mom!
Hang on, Mrs. Eels!

598
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:13,387
<i>Marty, hurry!</i>
<i>Hurry, Marty! Hurry!</i>

599
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:28,563
<i>Marty, hurry!</i>

600
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:34,340
Marty, you gotta hurry.

601
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,149
<i>Hurry, Marty!</i>

602
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:22,192
- Blanchard, hands up!
- Police officer!

603
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:27,424
<i>Blanchard, you're under arrest</i>
<i>for the murder of Harold Gumbal.</i>

604
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:31,434
- Come on! Come on.
- Go.

605
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:41,367
Great. Thank you.
They got him. It's over.

606
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,437
That's good.

607
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:47,450
Mrs. Eels,
you're probably going to
have to testify...

608
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,248
about that phone call
you overheard.

609
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:54,083
You <i>told</i> him?

610
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,820
I didn't tell him.

611
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:00,796
He figured it out.
He's a real detective.

612
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:07,096
Actually, he... found you.

613
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:09,765
We had no idea where you were.

614
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,967
<i>He put all the clues together.</i>

615
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,546
He, um-

616
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:20,778
It really was
some of the most unique
detective work I've ever seen.

617
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,978
<i>Just an incredible detective.</i>

618
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:25,613
His detecting is like-
What?

619
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,525
He doesn't need
anyone's help, Mrs. Eels.

620
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,527
No. No one's help.

621
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,722
Really?

622
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,794
W-When the kidnapper called,
they both panicked.

623
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,833
I-I-I'm prone
to panicking.

624
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:47,742
A-And I had to say,
"Let's get focused, because
my mother's in trouble."

625
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,246
And-And that got
everybody focused.

626
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:53,681
But then I had to concentrate
on the sounds from the background.

627
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:57,812
I could hear the ocean.
And I heard a clang and a thud.

628
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,822
Thud and a clang.

629
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,688
A thud and a clang.
And-And 8:20.

630
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,491
Why not 8:00?
Why not 8:30?

631
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:10,022
And then I remembered
high tide is at 8:20.

632
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,263
Once I had that piece,
then it all fell together.
Oh.

633
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,897
Oh, Marty.
Marty, you're wonderful.

634
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:22,537
I'd like to thank
the police department,

635
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,740
particularly Captain Stottlemeyer...

636
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,942
<i>and, uh, Adrian Monk.</i>

637
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:29,076
<i>This was a very difficult case</i>
<i>for me.</i>

638
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,713
Uh, last night I made a decision.

639
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,781
It's the toughest decision
of my career.

640
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:38,556
But I'm going to resign my practice...

641
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:42,725
<i>and take a teaching position</i>
<i>at Fulton Community College...</i>

642
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,499
where I'll be teaching
modern criminal investigative techniques.

643
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:51,905
You were right about him,
weren't you?

644
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,171
He was cheating.

645
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:56,179
<i>Over here, Mr. Eels.</i>

646
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,015
Dropped the key.

647
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,450
He was cheating.
