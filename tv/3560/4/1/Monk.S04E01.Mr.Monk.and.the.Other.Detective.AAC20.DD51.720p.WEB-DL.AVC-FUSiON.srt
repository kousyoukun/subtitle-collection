Okay. They drove off

See these sewer grates
around here?

154
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,671
The perps might have
stuffed something down in there,

155
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,374
and maybe this dog
saw them do it.

156

You gotta be kidding.
He's kidding, right? He's joking.

The man is joking.

158

I wasn't on the news.

165
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,278

Mm-hmm. I found a lot of clues.

167

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back off. Back off.

<i>[Stottlemeyer]</i>
<i>He was shot in the chest.</i>

307

Call the coroner's office.
Get the crime scene guys up here. And get me a 20-foot perimeter now!

308
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,050
Let's go! You heard the man.
Take 10 steps back! Let's go!

309
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:25,221
Get out of here!
Baker, come on! Move these guys down.

310
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,356
That's interesting.
What?

311
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,626
You don't see that?

312
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,903
Look at his arms.
That is an unnatural position.

313
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,942
Unnatural?

314
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,478
I think he was trying
to tell us something.

315
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,878
With his dying breath,
he was trying to send us a message.

316
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,884
[Monk]
With his dying breath.

317
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:52,720
He was trying to tell us
the name of the man who killed him. Look.

318
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:57,228
<i>See, he's pointing to his watch.</i>

319

No, he's not.

Captain, are there any perps
who'd do a job like this by the name of... Casio?

321
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,365
Casio?

322
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,803
Lefty.
Captain.

323
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:12,602
- Dial.
- Eddie Dial.

Well, let's check him out.
Yes, sir.

328
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,670
Mom, have you seen my camera?

329
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,932
Mm-mmm.
Did you check your jacket?

330
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,975
What about your pockets?
Yes, I looked everywhere.

331
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:47,102
I haven't seen it, honey.
Why don't you ask Mr. Monk to help you?

332
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,845
Please, Mr. Monk.
It has all my pictures in it from my school trip.

333
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,785
I was the official photographer
and if I lose it, I'm going to get an incomplete.

334
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,845
When did you see it last?

335
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,788
I saw it yesterday
in the living room.

336

<i>That plant has been</i>
<i>moved recently.</i>

337
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,768
That's right.
How did you know?

338
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,711
Well, normally,
they lean toward the sun.

339
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,874
This one is leaning
the other way.

340
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,754
Hello.

341
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,484
Mr. Monk, thank you so much.
You're the best. Isn't he the best?

342
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,722
There's no one better.
You really are amazing.

343

<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>Oh. Wait.</i>

345
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,671
Oh, uh, this morning.

346
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,867
<i>Well, the camera</i>
<i>could not have been back there</i> <i>this morning.</i>

347

It would have gotten wet.

348
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,710
Thanks for trying, Julie.

349
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,774
My mom put me up to this.

350
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,026
Mr. Monk,
you really are amazing.

351
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,395
You're probably
the best in the world.

<i>[Cell Phone Rings]</i>

this Marty character. He's cheating.

354
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,405
I don't know.
He is. Hello?

355

Yes, sir.

Okay, okay. We're on our way.

358
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,284
They just caught one of the killers.
They're questioning him now.

Yeah.

Look, man, I didn't hurt
anybody, okay?

366
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,404
I didn't even
have a gun.

367

Well, two people are dead,
Edward.

368
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,975
Who did the shooting?

369
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,819
I'm willing to bet you
it was that guy. Blanchard, Victor P.

370
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,882
The two of you were seen together
last weekend.

Where is he, Eddie?
I don't know!

Captain.
May I?

373
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,669
Where's your-
Where's your partner, Eddie?

374
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,184
I don't know.

375
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,347
Hmm. He's telling the truth.
He- He doesn't know.

376
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,756
- Do you have a map?
- He's like a human lie detector.

377
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:51,159
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it either.

378
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:54,960
Well, he's doing it.
Well, I still don't believe it.

Stuff we found in Eddie's motel room,

He found the car.
He found the body.

Guess they didn't want me
to cramp his style.

Well, A-Adrian, l-I'm sure
that this is all just temporary.

427
00:26:47,624 --> 00:26:50,684
Maybe he really is
better than me.

He offered me a job
last year.

Maybe I'll give him
a call.

434
00:27:14,651 --> 00:27:17,552
All right.
So you're just giving up. Okay.

435
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:21,249
No, Adrian, I'm not suggesting
that you just give up.

436
00:27:21,324 --> 00:27:24,589
I'm saying to you
that there is always someone ahead of you.

437
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:27,186
This is the human condition.
For instance,

438
00:27:27,263 --> 00:27:30,027
there's a new psychiatrist
here in town, name of Lowenstern.

439
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:35,935
Now, I know that there is
no way that I will ever be as-as-well, as good as he is.

440
00:27:36,005 --> 00:27:38,235
I know this.
I accept it.

441
00:27:38,307 --> 00:27:40,241
He's better than you?

442
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:43,142
He's brilliant.
Nominated for a Nobel Prize.

443
00:27:43,212 --> 00:27:46,704
But the point is
you think that you might enjoy teaching.

444
00:27:46,783 --> 00:27:50,184
I don't know.
Tell-Tell me more about this Lowenstern.

445
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:53,381
Lowenstern.
I could introduce you. Office is right across the street.

446
00:27:53,456 --> 00:27:56,425
He charges $400 an hour.

447
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:01,363
So wh-where were we?

448
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:03,456
Mmm. Okay.

449
00:28:09,505 --> 00:28:13,566
Oh. Good morning, boss.
They were out of the round sponges.

450
00:28:13,643 --> 00:28:15,611
Don't panic.
I'll pick some up on the way home.

451
00:28:15,678 --> 00:28:19,774
Don't worry about the groceries.
You're driving me to Fulton College. I have an appointment.

452
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:22,613
You mean now?
11:00. I'm meeting the dean.

453
00:28:22,685 --> 00:28:25,620
You're just gonna quit,
just like that?

454
00:28:25,688 --> 00:28:27,747
I think I would make

Oh, Mr. Monk,
you'd make a <i>terrible</i> teacher!

It would take you four weeks
to correct one paper.

You're a detective.
You're a great detective.

drive me or not? - No. No, I'm not.

Fulton College

It is up the interstate.
It's over a bridge.

You know, I have a blindfold
for going over bridges.

I'll just sort of peek underneath.

479
00:29:32,755 --> 00:29:36,054
I'm not gonna let you drive.
You've never driven over a bridge in your life.

480

What choice do I have?
[Woman On Phone] Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

You don't have to take the bridge.

You can take the causeway
all the way up.

People fooling around. People arguing.

I could write a book about it.

602
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:05,505
Yeah. Uh-

603
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:08,015
An ocean. He-

604
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:11,416
- I think he was near an ocean.
- There you go.

605
00:36:11,487 --> 00:36:15,446
And there was, um...
a ringing like- like a clang.

606
00:36:15,524 --> 00:36:17,492
Clang.

607
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,619
With a sound before it. Um-

608
00:36:19,695 --> 00:36:21,686
It was like a thud...

609
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:23,698
clang.

610
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:25,700
Thud! Clang!

611
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:27,895
Okay. Give me a minute.

612
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,904
Thud, clang!

613
00:36:29,972 --> 00:36:32,065
Yeah, Marty.
I got it. Thud, clang.

614
00:36:32,141 --> 00:36:34,200
Let me think.

617

Oh, my God, she's here!
She's here, she's here! Mom. Mom!

618
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:49,019
No, Marty, don't-
Don't get separated!

619
00:36:49,091 --> 00:36:51,150
Mom!
Stay with the group!

620
00:36:51,227 --> 00:36:55,425
Marty, I want you to focus.
Can you focus?

621
00:36:55,497 --> 00:36:59,900
All right, the caller
said that she would be dead by 8:20, was it?

622
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:02,961
Why 8:20?
Why not 8:00 or 8:30?

623
00:37:04,006 --> 00:37:06,474
- 8:20.
- Think!

624
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:08,635
I'm thinking.
Well, think harder!

625
00:37:08,711 --> 00:37:11,908
Why don't you think?
Hey, I'm not the great big famous detective.

Well, you were two hours ago!

- 8:20.
- What's 8:20?

629
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:21,816
High tide.

Great. Thank you.

That's good.

650
00:39:44,533 --> 00:39:47,468
Mrs. Eels,
you're probably going to have to testify...

651
00:39:47,536 --> 00:39:50,266
about that phone call
you overheard.

652
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,101
You <i>told</i> him?

653
00:39:54,176 --> 00:39:56,838
I didn't tell him.

654
00:39:56,912 --> 00:40:00,814
He figured it out.
He's a real detective.

655
00:40:02,518 --> 00:40:07,114
Actually, he... found you.

656
00:40:07,189 --> 00:40:09,783
We had no idea where you were.

657
00:40:09,858 --> 00:40:11,985
<i>He put all the clues together.</i>

658
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,528
<i>[Thud]</i>
<i>[Bell Rings]</i>

659
00:40:14,596 --> 00:40:16,564
He, um-

660
00:40:16,632 --> 00:40:20,796
It really was
some of the most unique detective work I've ever seen.

661
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:22,996
<i>[Natalie]</i>
<i>Just an incredible detective.</i>

662
00:40:23,071 --> 00:40:25,631
His detecting is like-
What?

663
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:29,543
He doesn't need
anyone's help, Mrs. Eels.

664
00:40:29,611 --> 00:40:31,545
No. No one's help.

665
00:40:31,613 --> 00:40:33,740
Really?

666
00:40:36,218 --> 00:40:38,812
W-When the kidnapper called,
they both panicked.

667
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:42,851
L-l-I'm prone
to panicking.

668
00:40:42,925 --> 00:40:47,760
A-And I had to say,
"Let's get focused, because my mother's in trouble."

669
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:50,264
And-And that got
everybody focused.

670
00:40:50,332 --> 00:40:53,699
But then I had to concentrate
on the sounds from the background.

671
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:57,830
I could hear the ocean.
And I heard a clang and a thud.

672
00:40:57,906 --> 00:40:59,840
Thud and a clang.

673
00:40:59,908 --> 00:41:02,706
A thud and a clang.
And-And 8:20.

674
00:41:02,778 --> 00:41:06,509
Why not 8:00?
Why not 8:30?

675
00:41:06,582 --> 00:41:10,040
And then I remembered
high tide is at 8:20.

676
00:41:10,118 --> 00:41:13,281
Once I had that piece,
then it all fell together. Oh.

677
00:41:13,355 --> 00:41:15,915
Oh, Marty.
Marty, you're wonderful.

678
00:41:19,461 --> 00:41:22,555
I'd like to thank
the police department,

679
00:41:22,631 --> 00:41:24,758
particularly Captain Stottlemeyer...

680
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:26,960
<i>and, uh, Adrian Monk.</i>

681

<i>This was a very difficult case</i>
<i>for me.</i>

682
00:41:29,171 --> 00:41:31,731
Uh, last night I made a decision.

683
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:34,799
It's the toughest decision
of my career.

684
00:41:34,877 --> 00:41:38,574
But I'm going to resign my practice...

685

<i>at Fulton Community College...</i>

689
00:41:51,994 --> 00:41:54,189
<i>[Shutters Clicking]</i>
He was cheating.
