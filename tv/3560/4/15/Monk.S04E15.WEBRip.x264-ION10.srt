00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:04,305
(Hal)
We're ahead of schedule.

2
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:05,506
(Marty)
That's a first, huh?

3
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:08,342
You wanna grab some coffee?

4
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:09,777
No, I gotta get home.

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,613
We're meeting
the wedding planner.

6
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:14,548
I thought that was
last night.

7
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:16,117
No, last night
was the caterer.

8
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,785
Should have taken
my advice.

9
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,320
Should have just eloped.

10
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,421
Yeah, well,
it's too late now.

11
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,290
Now, it's not, man.
You can do it.

12
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:24,325
Hop on a plane tonight,
go to Vegas.

13
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,227
Boom, it's all over.

14
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,364
Rachel's mom
would never speak to me again.

15
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:31,832
That's the best argument
to do it.

16
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,401
I've been trying to get
my mother-in-law

17
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:34,768
to shut up for five years.

18
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:37,605
What the hell are they doing?

19
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:44,278
Hit the brakes!
I'm trying.

20
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:45,513
Try the emergency brake!

21
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:46,580
This is Baker 4.

22
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:47,815
We're on Vinton
and Hillside.

23
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,317
It's a hijacking.

24
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,319
I repeat, we are
being hijacked.

25
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,554
They're jamming us.

26
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,737
[Randy Newman ragtime theme]

00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,872
* It's a jungle out there

28
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:16,277
* Disorder and confusion
everywhere *

29
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,479

30
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,848
* Well, I do

00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,384

00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,354

the water that you drink? *

35
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:36,530
* Well, I do,

you'd be worried too *

00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,286

44
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:10,231
So it's been sitting here
for three days

45
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:11,665
and nobody noticed it.

46
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,701
Yeah, the place has been
locked up for months.

47
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,635
They're about
to tear it down.

48
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,604
And these are the drivers.

49
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,506
The M.E. said
they put up a fight.

50
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:21,942
I mean, blood everywhere
like there was a struggle.

51
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:22,810
Well, good for them.

52
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,945
Maybe they injured
one of the bastards.

53
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,447
Let's check the hospitals.

54
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,781
I want a list
of all gunshot wounds,

55
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,483
knife wounds.
Yes, sir.

56
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:31,752
You okay?

57
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:32,886
Oh, toothache.

58
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,722
Wait, is that
the same tooth?

59
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,757
I told you
to take care of that.

60
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,891
Yeah, I am.

61
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:40,561
I'm chewing
on the other side.

62
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:42,530
It's fine,
I hardly notice it.

63
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:43,531
Mmm!

64
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,699
You're crying.

65
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,568
Randy, you're no good to me
like this.

66
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:48,602
Go to a dentist.

67
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:50,271
I have an appointment
Saturday.

68
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:51,539
Oh, I get it.

69
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,507
You don't wanna use up
your sick days.

70
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,775
You're saving your sick days
for when

71
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:58,912
you're not feeling sick,
is that it?

72
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,548
I'm gonna go talk
to Monk.

73
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:03,551
You make me wanna
talk to Monk.

74
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,887
[wincing in pain]

75
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:11,925
Ahh.
[gasps]

76
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,727
Oooh.

77
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:14,862
God, I just heard
one of those guys

78
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:15,763
was about to get married.

79
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:18,266
[whimpering]

80
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,901
Randy?

81
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,470
I know, I know,
it's heartbreaking.

82
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:25,673
They were so young.

83
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,975
Sweetie, it's okay
to cry.

84
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:31,279
It means you have a heart.

85
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:33,314
Here, look at me.

86
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:34,582
You're a
compassionate person.

87
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,417
That's nothing
to be ashamed of.

88
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,851
It hurts.

89
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:41,422
I know.
I know it hurts.

90
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:45,793
Oh.
[sighing]

91
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,928
You don't want
anybody to see you?

92
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,830
I understand.

93
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,865
You know what?
If anyone says anything,

94
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:52,866
we'll just say
that you, uh...

95
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,801
My tooth, oh...

96
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,803
Yeah, perfect,
that you have a toothache.

97
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,538
Oh, God.

98
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,672
God, this hurts.

99
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:00,574
Okay, I think
that's overdoing it.

100
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,376
Oh, please, Jesus,
somebody just shoot me.

101
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,844
Randy, no one's
gonna believe that.

102
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:06,880
There's some oil
on the floor.

103
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,782
Is that a clue?

104
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:09,750
Is that important?

105
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,720
Nah, there's oil
on the floor.

106
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,822
I'll call the EPA.

107
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:19,059
So, do you, uh...
any ideas about the robbery?

108
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,361
Did you notice
the back bumper,

109
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:21,362
how damaged it was?

110
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:22,430
Yeah.

111
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,832
And these side mirrors
are pushed in.

112
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:27,301
I don't think
this armored car

113
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:29,703
was driven here.

114
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:31,439
It wasn't?
No.

115
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:34,842
I think it was carried
somehow

116
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,511
in the back
of a bigger truck.

117
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,880
You can see the tire tracks
from a larger vehicle.

118
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,582
You're right.

119
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:47,655
It was probably an 18-wheeler
about 14 feet wide.

120
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:50,090
So, they brought
the armored car here,

121
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,025
they unload it.

122
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:55,028
How did they get the drivers
out of the cab?

123
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:00,801
With this.

124
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,803
A piece of rubber tubing.

125
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,739
They drilled the hole here.

126
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:08,609
In the Plexiglas.

127
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,611
They gassed them out.

128
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:14,915
Randy?

129
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,884
Yes, sir?

130
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,386
Bag this stuff.

131
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,487
Oh.

132
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,488
He has a toothache.

133
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,655
Yeah, I know.

134
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,824
He's been bitching about it
all week.

135
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,693
What, it's a real
toothache?

136
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,528
Yeah.
smack!

137
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:28,729
I can't believe you lied
to me like that.

138
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,130
What didn't you just say
I have a toothache?

139
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,800
I did, like ten times.

140
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,836
Randy, if you don't take care
of this tooth immediately,

141
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:39,440
today, I'm gonna
rip it out myself, understand?

142
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,642
Fine.

143
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,878
What?

144
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:51,852
Oh...
Ow.

145
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,821
Mr. Disher?

146
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,689
Yeah.
Oh, good.

147
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,425
I'm Carrie.

148
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,393
Did you do
all your paperwork?

149
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:00,494
Both sides.

150
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:01,762
Good boy.

151
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,163
Yeah.

152
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,898
Where's your receptionist?

153
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:07,735
Oh, our nighttime
receptionist quit.

154
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,903
Couldn't stand
the excitement, huh?

155
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:10,904
I guess not.

156
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,773
So you're gonna be
in room B.

157
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,675
That's between A and C.

158
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,910
Well, what if I get lost?

159
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:18,912
You want me
to draw you a map?

160
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,914
Yeah, I think
I can find it.

161
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:21,915
Okay.

162
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,951
I'll be right in.

163
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,659
(Dr. Bloom)
Well, Mr. Disher,

164
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,527
I'm Oliver Bloom.

165
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:34,895
Don't get up.
Just kidding.

166
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,897
You're a Lieutenant,
am I right?

167
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,566
I can usually guess
within one rank.

168
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:39,667
I see a lot of cops
in here.

169
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,634
We're on
the medical plan, you know.

170
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,903
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

171
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,805
Oh, that's not a problem.

172
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,974
We're open late
on Tuesdays and Thursdays

173
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,576
in case of emergencies.

174
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,611
Also to keep Terri here
off the streets.

175
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,112
He worries about me.

176
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,514
I do.

177
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,381
You know what
I'm really worried about?

178
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,918
I worry about
this bad boy right here.

179
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,920
Your number three molar.

180
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,590
Terri, can I have a light,
please?

181
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:07,194
I want you to open wide,
just try to relax.

182
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,428
A little wider.

183
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:10,998
Uh.
Uh!

184
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,633
Okay, okay, okay.

185
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,934
A little sensitive.

186
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,235
Well, I hope you're not
in love with that tooth,

187
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,704
Lieutenant, because
I'm afraid it's gonna

188
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:17,838
have to go.

189
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,473
Now, we can either
pull it next week,

190
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:22,042
or we can do it today.
The choice is yours.

191
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,911
Let's do it now.

192
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,113
Okay, Randy, we're gonna
put you under

193
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,781
for about 30 minutes.

194
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:28,816
You're not gonna
feel a thing.

195
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:31,819
As a matter of fact,
you're gonna be back here

196
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:33,587
every week for this.

197
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,523
And if you're a
really good boy,

198
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:36,924
I'm gonna give you
a sticker afterwards.

199
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,459
What if I'm a bad boy?

200
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,996
Just breathe.

201
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,798
Breathe normally, relax.

202
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:47,701
I know it's hard
with Terri standing over you.

203
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:50,103
Can you hear me?

204
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,841
Just relax, I want you
to take ten deep breaths, okay?

205
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:59,813
One, two, three.

206
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:02,616
Four...

207
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,021
Terri, I'm gonna need
that angled

208
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:10,758
director probe again please.

209
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,661
Angled director probe.

210
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:19,867
Doctor, wait, I think
he's coming awake again.

211
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,643
Come on.

212
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:31,879
[door opens]
Hey!

213
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,080
What are you
doing here?

214
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,815
What did you do
with Barry Bonds?

215
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,784
I know he's here somewhere.

216
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,852
What did you do?
I know he's here.

217
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,087
I know he's here.
What are you talking about?

218
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,755
Barry Bonds.

219
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,757
Listen--
We don't know any Barry Bonds.

220
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,158
He is worth $13 million.

221
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,560
What did you do with him?

222
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:47,795
We're with a patient here.

223
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:48,629
Yeah, we have a patient here.
We're really...

224
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,831
Listen, Barry Bonds.
Can you look at--

225
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:51,799
Arrgh!

226
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:56,269
(Lt. Disher)
Hey.

227
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:59,339
Hey, cut it out.

228
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,108
I'm a police officer.

229
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,910
Uh!
Uh!

230
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,947
I'm a police officer.

231
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,818
Hey, sleeping beauty.

232
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:12,820
Welcome back.

233
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,624
Are you all right?

234
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:19,092
Am I all right?
Why wouldn't I be?

235
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:22,195
There was a man in here.

236
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:28,101
You...
You were fighting.

237
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,638
Well, there was
a fight, all right.

238
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:31,639
Between me
and this molar here.

239
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,641
It didn't wanna come out.

240
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:35,643
There's gonna be some
sensitivity for a few days.

241
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:36,677
I wrote you a prescription.

242
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,145
This should help
with the pain.

243
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,080
Now, don't take more
than one every four hours.

244
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:43,150
Oh, and I almost forgot.

245
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,853
Your sticker.

246
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,633
(First detective)
Captain, there are
no reports

247
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:00,768
of any stolen trucks.

248
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,402
Well, keep looking.
Widen the net.

249
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,838
Start at Seattle
and work your way south.

250
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:06,674
Captain, here's a copy
of the updated manifest.

251
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,341
The cash was new, right?

252
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,010
Yes, sir, it would have been
easily traced.

253
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,279
All they took were the
negotiable bank certificates.

254
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,681
Over $10 million.

255
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:14,948
All right, let's follow
the money.

256
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,751
How many fences in the country
could handle a haul like this?

257
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:18,786
I'll find out.

258
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,054
Captain?
Randy, welcome back.

259
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,656
You're working with Patterson
on the bank certificates.

260
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,224
Get me Frank Davis at the
Treasury Department

261
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:25,192
on the line.

262
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,160
And put a list together
of all the fences.

263
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:28,328
Any fence in the country
who's got the balls--

264
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,297
Captain, do you have
a minute?

265
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,298
Yeah, what's up?

266
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:34,802
It's about my dentist,
Dr. Bloom?

267
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,270
Yeah?

268
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,740
I think, um...

269
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,709
I think he might...

270
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:44,377
Did he touch you
inappropriately?

271
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:47,180
What?
No, Jesus, no.

272
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:49,449
No.

273
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,751
I think he killed a guy.

274
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,786
He what?

275
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,121
It happened.

276
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,324
I think that he--Dr. Bloom
and his assistant Terri?

277
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,792
I mean, I think
they murdered someone.

278
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,194
You saw it?

279
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,697
Yeah, sort of.
I was sedated.

280
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:07,134
You were sedated?

281
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,770
Randy, one time,
I was under anesthesia.

282
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,471
I thought my moustache
was a chipmunk.

283
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,907
I was the
Green Lantern once.

284
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:15,408
It was great.

285
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,376
I didn't wanna wake up.

286
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:20,480
Look, I was supposed to be out
for 30 minutes.

287
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,149
But I was under
for almost two hours.

288
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,917
Was there a body?

289
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:25,786
No.
Any signs of struggle?

290
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:26,854
No.
And who did they kill?

291
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,822
I don't know.
It was a guy.

292
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:32,025
Male, Caucasian, 5'11",
200 pounds.

293
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,861
They were arguing about
Barry Bonds.

294
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:34,762
And I'm pretty sure
that I can ID him.

295
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:35,963
The baseball player?

296
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:38,265
Yeah.

297
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,432
I this guy thought that

298
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,869
Dr. Bloom
kidnapped Barry Bonds.

299
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,772
They were arguing about how much
Barry Bonds was worth.

300
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,173
Hey, you know, if your dentist
played baseball,

301
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,274
you know what team
he'd play for?

302
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:51,478
The Yanks.
Get it?

303
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:52,746
[laughing]

304
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,147
It's not funny.

305
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:57,117
It's a little funny, Randy.

306
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,787
Look, why don't you, um...

307
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,756
Take a walk.
Clear you head.

308
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,292
Here, drop this off
at Monk's.

309
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:06,794
He's waiting for this.

310
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:07,995
Then take the rest
of the day off, okay?

311
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:10,831
Go to the movies,
go to the beach.

312
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,265
Okay?
Get out of here.

313
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:13,867
I'll call you later.

314
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:18,005
Is this everything?
The whole file?

315
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,507
Yeah.

316
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,276
Monk, can I ask you
a question?

317
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,913
What do you
normally charge?

318
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:29,349
You know, for someone
who wants to...hire you.

319
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:30,951
I mean, not the department.

320
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,786
A private party.

321
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,821
Like who?

322
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,823
Like me.

323
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,524
Is this about
the dentist?

324
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,525
The Captain called us.

325
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:41,561
He said
you had a reaction

326
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,797
to the anesthesia.
You were probably hallucina--

327
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:45,899
No, I wasn't hallucinating.

328
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,067
It really happened.

329
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,870
It was as real as you are
right now

330
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:52,039
standing in front of me.

331
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:55,876
Randy, I'm not standing.

332
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,181
But if you need my help...

333
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,183
you don't have to pay me.

334
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,584
All you have to do
is ask.

335
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,987
I mean, you're one
of my oldest friends.

336
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,890
I've known you for years.

337
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,391
Thank you.

338
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,260
I want you to come back to
the dentist's office with me.

339
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,396
Let me finish.

340
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:19,532
Unfortunately, at the moment,
I have a lot of things

341
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,201
on my plate.
No, you don't.

342
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:25,305
Well, I have
this armored car thing.

343
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,007
I have to read
this whole file

344
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,841
that's about 120 pages.

345
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,844
And I just found a typo,
by the way.

346
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:33,613
And I have to replace
the lint filter on my dryer.

347
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,582
Filters do not
replace themselves.

348
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,150
Mr. Monk, can I talk
to you for a minute?

349
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:38,551
I have to talk
to Natalie for a minute.

350
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,153
Privately?

351
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:41,955
In the kitchen?

352
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:43,256
Now.
Okay.

353
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,131
Mr. Monk, this is Randy
we're talking about.

354
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,132
He would do anything
for you.

355
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,466
And I would do anything
for him

356
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,501
except this, Natalie.

357
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:55,602
I can't do it.

358
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:56,970
I have a thing
about dentists.

359
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,438
You have a thing
about everything.

360
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,074
That's true, but dentists
are in a separate category

361
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:03,010
altogether, okay?

362
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,577
I can't even discuss it.

363
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,646
I can't even think
about discussing it.

364
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,381
I can't even talk about
thinking about discussing it.

365
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,150
Mr. Monk, everybody's afraid
of dentists.

366
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,319
Not like this.
Not like this.

367
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,021
Okay, okay, okay.
How afraid are you?

368
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,622
On a scale of 1 to 10.

369
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:16,523
10.

370
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,658
I am so far beyond 10,
I laugh at your 10s.

371
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,628
I lie awake at night
dreaming about 10s.

372
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,663
The chair and the probing
and the drilling.

373
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,797
And the rinsing.

374
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,666
Okay, Mr. Monk, what do you do
when you get a cavity?

375
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,635
I don't get a cavity.
I don't get cavities.

376
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,437
I brush my teeth
12 times a day

377
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,638
and I floss
every 90 minutes.

378
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:32,973
So you've never been
to a dentist.

379
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,942
Once, when I was 12.

380
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,043
How'd that go?

381
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,378
Not well.

382
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:39,579
You know,
this is ridiculous.

383
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:40,948
We're just gonna go there
and look around.

384
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,282
You're not a patient.

385
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,683
You're not
sitting in the chair.

386
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,517
There's no probing.

387
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,652
There's no drilling.

388
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:48,521
I'll be with you
the whole time.

389
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,057
No.

390
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:57,430
He's happy to do it.

391
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:58,565
Great.

392
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,109
[Natalie whispering]
I don't see anything.

393
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,578
It happened
in the other room.

394
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:12,512
Room B.

395
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:15,415
What do you think?

396
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,250
Psst, Mr. Monk.

397
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:20,053
I'm pretty sure
this is how the Nazis

398
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,089
decorated their bunkers.

399
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:24,357
Don't look at that,
look-look down.

400
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:25,592
Look at the carpet.

401
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,593
What a beautiful carpet.

402
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:27,594
It is a beautiful carpet.

403
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:28,595
Right?
Is that better?

404
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:29,629
That is better.

405
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,234
Oh, Highlights for Children.

406
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,602
Oh, find the hidden picture.

407
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,237
I used to love these.

408
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,973
Where is the egg beater?

409
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:42,542
It's under the sled.

410
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,344
You're right.

411
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,579
And the umbrella
is in the cloud

412
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,615
above the snowman.

413
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,617
And the fish
is next to the ice skate.

414
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,485
Okay, how are
you doing that?

415
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,587
I read that same issue...

416
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,689
35 years ago.

417
00:15:56,723 --> 00:16:00,360
It was in the...

418
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,429
It was in...

419
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,097
the dentist's office.

420
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,232
Natalie, I can't do this.

421
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,167
Yeah, no no no no no,
you can do this.

422
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,202
You can do this.
You're doing great.

423
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:10,403
Okay, here here here,
sit down

424
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,205
and think about
something else, okay?

425
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:14,341
Here, I brought
the case file.

426
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:15,608
Concentrate on this.

427
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:21,581
Lieutenant.
You back for more?

428
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:24,117
Hey, uh...
No.

429
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,618
Actually, I think
I just left my cell phone...

430
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,320
in the chair in room B.

431
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:28,588
Oh, well, it's empty now

432
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:29,589
if you wanna take a look.

433
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,358
Great.

434
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:33,626
Oh, I'm Natalie,
I'm just gonna help him.

435
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,594
He can't ever find anything.

436
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:35,795
Sure.

437
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,097
I'm gonna be right back.

438
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,298
I'm gonna be right here.
Are you okay?

439
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,301
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good.

440
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:55,248
Okay, I was in the chair.

441
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,684
And they were fighting
over there.

442
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,390
Okay, well,
I don't see anything.

443
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:07,660
(Lt. Disher)
He bought new equipment.

444
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,731
He bought new equipment
to replace the stuff

445
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,600
that got broken
during the fight.

446
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:16,603
Maybe.

447
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:26,613
[drilling sound]

448
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:27,680
What's that?

449
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:28,815
It's a drill.

450
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:32,685
Don't be afraid.

451
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,487
I'm not afraid.

452
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:38,758
Don't be afraid.

453
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,762
Don't be afraid.

454
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,104
(Natalie)
Mr. Monk, it's okay.

455
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:53,140
We're gonna go home now.
You can let go.

456
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:54,141
No, no,
we're not going anywhere.

457
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:55,408
He hasn't seen anything yet.

458
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:56,609
(Natalie)
I think he's seen enough.

459
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,445
Is there a problem?

460
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,580
Oh, no no, I just left
my cell phone

461
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:01,748
in the other room.

462
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,683
Dr. Bloom,
this is Adrian Monk.

463
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:04,417
He's a friend of mine.

464
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,453
The Adrian Monk,
the detective?

465
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,821
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

466
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:12,625
Apparently, the pleasure's
all mine.

467
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,227
No, he just has a little thing
about dentists.

468
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:15,228
You know what?

469
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,629
It happens to me
all the time.

470
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,598
I don't take it
personally.

471
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,300
Let me help you with that.

472
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,736
Oh, are you working on
the armored car case?

473
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,904
I've been reading about it.

474
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,174
I'm a bit of a true crime
aficionado.

475
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:29,442
I'm sorry,
that's just classified.

476
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,244
Well, you got
a couple of hobbies then, huh?

477
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,679
True crime and baseball.

478
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,548
Baseball?

479
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:36,883
Well, yeah, I'm sure
I heard you guys

480
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,352
talking about
Barry Bonds yesterday.

481
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:40,353
[both laughing]

482
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:41,654
Well, you know what,
people hear

483
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:43,723
a lot of crazy things
when they're under sedation.

484
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:45,392
They say a lot
of crazy things too.

485
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:46,726
I should write a book,
really.

486
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,728
Yes, sir, I understand.

487
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:49,529
Okay, we're on our way.

488
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:50,730
We gotta go,
that was the Captain.

489
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,165
Oh, we gotta go.

490
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,633
Okay.

491
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,701
Take care.

492
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,610
A couple of fishermen
just found him.

493
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:07,180
These two bruises,
ten inches apart.

494
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:09,649
There's another set
of bruises

495
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,684
exactly ten inches apart.

496
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:12,685
Yeah, what caused that?

497
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:15,955
Well, it must be something
ten inches apart.

498
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,358
Thanks a lot.

499
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,293
Well, what do you got?
You said it was important.

500
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:23,730
I found this in his trousers.
It was in his pants cuff.

501
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:27,367
It's Plexiglas.

502
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,835
It's gotta be
one of the hijackers.

503
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,470
He drilled the hole.

504
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,705
So who is he?

505
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:33,873
Turn him over.

506
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,211
I don't recognize him,
do you?

507
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:39,446
No.

508
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,681
Oh, my God.

509
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:42,615
That's the guy.

510
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,317
That's the guy
from the dentist's office.

511
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,953
Randy, I told you
to take some time off.

512
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:49,422
Captain, that's the guy.

513
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,623
I told you
I could ID him.

514
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:51,624
And that is
definitely the guy.

515
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:54,494
What, this is the guy
that your dentist killed

516
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,296
along with his hygienist?
That's right.

517
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,897
This the guy
that they killed

518
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,666
in front of you while
you were in the chair.

519
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:00,733
That's right.

520
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,436
All right, because Dr. Bloom
kidnapped Barry Bonds,

521
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,472
and they were arguing
about the ransom money, right?

522
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:06,973
Yeah--what, is that
so crazy?

523
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:09,709
What the hell are you
laughing at, Peterson?

524
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:10,643
I'm not crazy.

525
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,445
Okay, nobody said
you were crazy, Randy.

526
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,513
Out loud.
While you were there

527
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,514
you should've had 'em
put some wisdom teeth in.

528
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,684
Hey, you can't even spell
wisdom teeth, Downey.

529
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,319
All right, look, Natalie.
What?

530
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:20,320
You and Monk
were there, right?

531
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:21,688
Did you notice anything?

532
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,691
Mmmm, no, I wasn't really
on my game.

533
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,326
I have this thing
about dentists.

534
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,662
Kroger calls it
a supermegaphobia.

535
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:32,599
If germs are here
and snakes are here,

536
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:33,700
the dentists are...

537
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,335
You see that branch
up there?

538
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:36,736
The second one
from the top?

539
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,771
The one
above that one.

540
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:42,509
Captain, are you going
to investigate this or not?

541
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,577
Look, Randy,
you were sedated.

542
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:45,978
You couldn't
have seen anything.

543
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:52,485
Fine, I quit.

544
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,886
You what?
No, I quit.

545
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,855
I'm sick and tired
of being treated

546
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,056
like the village idiot.

547
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,458
Here's my gun
and my badge.

548
00:20:58,491 --> 00:20:59,459
Randy, come on.

549
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:01,394
I'm not a joke.

550
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,463
I'm not here
to entertain you.

551
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,398
I'm a homicide detective.

552
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,667
Randy, don't be ridiculous.

553
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,001
Take it.

554
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:14,040
Randy.

555
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,312
Randy.

556
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:27,354
Captain, they just
ID'ed the body.

557
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:28,788
Are you ready for this?

558
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,923
It's Denny Jardeen.

559
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:31,924
Ooh, I know that name.

560
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,360
Yeah, he's an ex-cop.

561
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:34,461
Worked the Mission District.

562
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:35,462
He was bad news.

563
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:37,497
Uh.

564
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,965
He was charged five times.

565
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:41,834
Excessive force,
conduct unbecoming.

566
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:45,372
Took an early retirement
four years ago.

567
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:47,006
Thanks.

568
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,577
What's he doing?

569
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,944
Flossing.

570
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,846
He's determined never to go
back to a dentist again.

571
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,715
Uh, just pretend
I'm not here.

572
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,850
Monk, cut it out,
I mean it.

573
00:21:57,884 --> 00:21:59,419
This is a floss-free zone.

574
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,087
Since when?

575
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,557
Since right now.
Cut it out.

576
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:08,361
What's this?

577
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:09,696
That's nothing.

578
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:12,365
Background check Oliver Bloom.

579
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:14,033
You're checking out
the dentist?

580
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,468
Yeah, I figured
it couldn't hurt

581
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:16,803
to check him out.

582
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,538
You're doing this
for Randy, aren't you?

583
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:20,607
Why don't you
just call him?

584
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,775
Because he quit.

585
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,644
Randy is an adult.

586
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,813
He made a decision
and I respect it.

587
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,482
You miss him,
I can tell.

588
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:32,452
Look, Natalie, it's not like
we were going steady, okay?

589
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:33,453
We worked together.

590
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:34,454
He was just another cop.

591
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:36,623
That is not true.

592
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:37,657
You're right,
it's not true.

593
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,658
He's not just another cop,

594
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,760
he was the single
most annoying human being

595
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:41,861
to ever wear a badge.

596
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:46,499
[gargling]

597
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:50,437
Present company excepted.

598
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,872
Okay, you guys,
let's try this new one.

599
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:56,108
I printed up
some lyric sheets.

600
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:57,810
Why do we need
lyric sheets?

601
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:59,512
You're the only one
singing.

602
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,548
Just so you can
follow along.

603
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:03,516
So you know
what it's about.

604
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,917
We're making a statement.

605
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:08,455
We are?

606
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:11,190
Okay, let's do it,
from the top.

607
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,425
A five, six, seven, eight.

608
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:13,426
Whoa whoa whoa!

609
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,827
What was that?

610
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:16,195
Counting off.

611
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,130
Five, six, seven, eight?

612
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:19,532
That's for dancing.

613
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,501
No, it's not.

614
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,903
You're supposed to go,
"One, two, three, four."

615
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:24,971
What's the difference?

616
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,106
It's rock 'n roll, man.

617
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,541
Let's do that blues song

618
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,643
we used to do.

619
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:32,211
Guys.
guys guys guys!

620
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,212
Hey, guys, guys, why don't
we just

621
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,781
stick to
the original material?

622
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:36,148
Okay?

623
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:38,150
I mean, that's what
the people wanna hear.

624
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:39,619
What people?

625
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:40,953
Randy, we're in my
stepfather's garage.

626
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:44,491
Well, Aaron, there might
be people one day.

627
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:46,726
I mean, touring,
record deal?

628
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,495
Come on, guys,
wasn't that the dream?

629
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:52,198
Maybe 17 years ago?
In 12th grade?

630
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:55,034
Well, you know what?

631
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,503
I still believe
in the dream.

632
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:59,238
I mean, I believe in
the Randy Disher Project.

633
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,640
Come on, I quit my job
for this.

634
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:01,974
Big mistake.

635
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:04,977
All right, let's just
do it, okay?

636
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:07,046
From the top.

637
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,215
If you say "Five, six,
seven, eight" again,

638
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:11,183
I quit.
I'm just telling you.

639
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:13,753
You know what--do you
wanna be the lead singer?

640
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,588
Excuse me.

641
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:19,225
Can I talk to Mick Jagger
for a second?

642
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:21,594
Yeah, sure.

643
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:24,263
All right, guys,
take a break, huh?

644
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,499
Oh, it's a really good job
so far, though.

645
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:27,800
Really good.

646
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,271
How's it going?

647
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,873
It's good.

648
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:34,974
It's great--I mean,
I should have done this

649
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:36,042
years ago.

650
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:38,077
Yeah, it's pretty exciting.

651
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,713
Um, you gotta send me
a t-shirt

652
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:44,551
or a hat or something.

653
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:45,518
Or whatever.

654
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:48,855
Um, listen, I thought
you might be interested.

655
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:51,123
We caught a break
on the armored car thing.

656
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,525
We identified the body.

657
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,794
Guy's name is Denny Jardeen.
He's an ex-cop.

658
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,229
He's got a cousin
who's done some time

659
00:24:57,263 --> 00:24:59,165
who works for
a trucking company.

660
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:00,199
So we're gonna go
pick him up.

661
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,602
I thought you'd like
to come along.

662
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:04,270
Why?

663
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:06,673
I mean, I'm not
a cop anymore, Leland.

664
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:09,041
Captain.

665
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:10,943
Look at my notebook.

666
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:11,744
No more witness statements.

667
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:14,113
Just lyrics
and song ideas now.

668
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:15,648
You're writing songs?

669
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,884
Yeah, I wrote 17 last night.

670
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:20,286
I'm on fire.

671
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,689
I'm sure you are.

672
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:26,225
Uh, I also wanted
to apologize

673
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:29,629
about the dentist.

674
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:32,298
It's just that over the years
you've had...

675
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:34,166
so many unique theories.

676
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,234
I wasn't hallucinating.

677
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:39,606
Randy, I checked Dr. Bloom out
myself on my own time.

678
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:41,107
The guy is clean.

679
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,845
He's got no priors.
He's never been in trouble.

680
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:49,281
I just wanted you to know
that I took you seriously.

681
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:56,623
The fact is, I miss you.
I need you.

682
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,795
Well, it's too late.

683
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:05,297
I've moved on.

684
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:07,299
I mean, the band's
my life now.

685
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,301
You're more than welcome
to come and have a listen

686
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:10,336
if you want.

687
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:15,041
Come on in, be my guest.
Have a seat.

688
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,175
Okay.

689
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,277
How you doing?

690
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,747
Hey.

691
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,048
I should warn you,

692
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,783
you might not like
what you hear.

693
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:24,984
It's pretty powerful stuff.

694
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:27,286
You might not be able
to handle it.

695
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,287
All right,
let's rock it out.

696
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,289
From the top.

697
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,258
One, two, three, four.

698
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,260
[whispering]
Five, six, seven, eight.

699
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:37,730
* I'm tired of sucking up

700
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:41,267
* And I'm tired of sucking up
and working for the man *

701
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,204
* Keeping people down
'cause the law says I can *

702
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,073
* Cuff my brothers
and sisters *

703
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,741
* That's not the way
to be *

704
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,810
* But honey those
days are gone *

705
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:54,280
* 'Cause baby I am free

706
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:56,215
*

707
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:59,652
* I don't need a badge
to tell me wrong from right *

708
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:03,355
* I don't need a badge
to tell me day from night *

709
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:07,193
* I don't need a badge
because my eyes can see *

710
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,261
* I don't need a badge

711
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,164
* Baby I am free

712
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:18,871
That was good.

713
00:27:18,905 --> 00:27:20,406
That wasn't too bad.

714
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:25,244
That was great.

715
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:31,718
Okay, now, before you even
knock on the door,

716
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:32,985
I want you to douse
this handkerchief

717
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,020
with the chloroform.

718
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:36,188
Just like this, okay?

719
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:40,226
20 CCs, and make sure
he really inhales it.

720
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,862
I don't know about this.

721
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,196
Well, we have to do it,
there's no choice.

722
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,364
No, no, I know.

723
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,867
I mean, I don't know
if 20 CCs is enough.

724
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,202
How do you know
he's gonna talk?

725
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,238
Did you see him?

726
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:53,973
He couldn't even shake my hand.
He was a mess.

727
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:59,311
You get Adrian Monk in here,
and I'll make him talk.

728
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:03,382
Neil, your fingerprints
were all over the warehouse

729
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,184
and on the armored car.

730
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:06,819
You could hire
the best lawyer in the city.

731
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:10,056
It's not gonna make
those fingerprints disappear.

732
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:12,358
It is all over
and you know it.

733
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:19,098
Okay, I was there.

734
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:21,367
But I didn't do
the two guards, man.

735
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,069
I tried to stop him.

736
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:24,136
Stop who?

737
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:27,273
Denny.
Denny Jardeen.

738
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:31,343
One of the guards fought back
and he went postal, man.

739
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,478
And started shooting.

740
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:34,046
Where's the money, Neal?

741
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,949
Denny's got it.

742
00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:38,417
He's keeping it in a shed
back behind his place

743
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,319
until we all split it up.

744
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:42,421
I got some bad news
for you, Neal.

745
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:43,890
Denny is dead.

746
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:46,325
Denny?

747
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:47,393
And there's no money

748
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:48,394
in that little tool shed.

749
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:49,862
We've already
ripped it apart.

750
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:51,397
Now that's impossible.

751
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,333
Looks like somebody
in your little sewing circle

752
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:57,103
got greedy.

753
00:28:57,136 --> 00:29:00,106
You can't trust anybody
these days, can you?

754
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:05,978
[knocking]

755
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:09,315
[harder knocking]

756
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:20,426
Oh, Mr. Monk.

757
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:23,095
I know it's late.
Can I come in?

758
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:25,197
Of course, of course.

759
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:26,498
Thank you.

760
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:29,201
[crying]

761
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:31,303
What--what is it?

762
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:34,841
Lieutenant Disher was right.

763
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:37,309
Dr. Bloom killed a man
two days ago.

764
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:39,812
And I don't even know
who it was.

765
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:43,182
I mean, I'd never
seen him before or anything.

766
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:45,384
[crying]

767
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:46,886
I just don't know
where else to go.

768
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,255
Yeah.

769
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,358
Yeah--are you gonna
be crying a lot?

770
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,493
Maybe you wanna
lean over the sink.

771
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,462
No, no, I'm fine.
I'm sorry.

772
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:57,930
I'm just scared to death.

773
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:59,298
Yeah, I'll call
the captain.

774
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:01,868
No!
No, Dr. Bloom would kill me.

775
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:03,970
You can't.
Oh, it's okay.

776
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:06,538
The police
will protect you.

777
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:08,507
Oh, what is that?

778
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,209
What--what?
I don't know.

779
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:11,177
What is it?

780
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,578
I don't--it's right...

781
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:14,213
It's a--something
on your face.

782
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:16,849
Like a smudge.

783
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:17,850
Smudge.
Yeah.

784
00:30:17,884 --> 00:30:19,518
No--no, you're not
getting it.

785
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:20,853
It's right there.

786
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:22,321
Did I get it?
Did I get it?

787
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,223
No.
Here, I'll do it.

788
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,224
Hold on.

789
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:28,360
Okay.

790
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:29,361
Did you get it?

791
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:30,496
Uh...
No?

792
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:34,166
No, it's right there.

793
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,234
Ugh.

794
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:38,270
Mmmph.
Chloroform.

795
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:40,907
You're drugging me.
Shhh.

796
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,542
Just relax.

797
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:46,879
Did you get it?

798
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,050
Did I get it?

799
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:59,358
Did I get it?

800
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,029
Did I get it.

801
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,135
Natalie!

802
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:10,369
Captain, is Mr. Monk here?

803
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:12,138
What would Monk
be doing here?

804
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:13,973
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

805
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:15,241
I called his house
to read him

806
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:16,342
tomorrow's weather report
like I always do,

807
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,509
but he didn't answer.

808
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,912
So I go over there,
the door's open.

809
00:31:19,946 --> 00:31:21,547
The light's on,
but he's not home.

810
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,484
The door was open.

811
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,353
Thank you for waiting.

812
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:03,222
The doctor will be
right with you.

813
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:07,193
There's...no rush.

814
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,603
Why are you doing this?

815
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:21,407
Why are you doing this?

816
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,009
Please.

817
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:26,645
Please.

818
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,380
What are you gonna do?

819
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,553
I didn't really
have a smudge, did I?

820
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:37,289
You should be flattered.

821
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:39,158
The doctor doesn't usually
come in this late.

822
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:42,761
Especially for new patients.

823
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,996
That tooth.

824
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:53,239
The roots are about
ten inches apart, aren't they?

825
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:54,340
If you say so.

826
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:57,209
I get it now.

827
00:32:57,243 --> 00:32:58,477
I know what happened.

828
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,581
The drivers fought back
during the hijacking.

829
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:05,717
Denny Jardeen
got hit in the face.

830
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:08,420
He must have knocked
a tooth loose.

831
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:13,125
So Jardeen came here
to get his tooth fixed.

832
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:15,094
Makes sense.

833
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:18,464
He's an ex-cop,
and you're on the medical plan.

834
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,733
He must have talked
in his sleep.

835
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:24,336
Dr. Bloom said
a lot of patients do.

836
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,471
He told you everything.

837
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,505
About the robbery,

838
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,607
where they hid the money,

839
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,410
it must have been
like winning the lottery.

840
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,512
If you say so.

841
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:36,582
That night, you went
to Jardeen's house,

842
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:38,784
found the money,
figured it was safe.

843
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:41,720
That he'd never remember
telling you anything.

844
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:44,123
But you were wrong.

845
00:33:44,156 --> 00:33:47,159
He did remember.

846
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:50,829
Or maybe, when the money
went missing,

847
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:54,500
he just figured it out.

848
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,602
He came back here
Tuesday night

849
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:58,270
while you were
working on Randy.

850
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,278
Randy witnessed
the whole thing, sort of.

851
00:34:06,312 --> 00:34:10,782
He was right
about everything.

852
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,852
Wasn't he?

853
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,422
If you say so.

854
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:18,324
Hello again, Mr. Monk.

855
00:34:21,627 --> 00:34:23,295
Is it true that you've
only been to the dentist

856
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:24,363
once before?

857
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:25,497
Yeah.

858
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:28,467
I gather it wasn't
a good experience.

859
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,136
Well, this'll be much worse.

860
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:32,704
I'm...

861
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,506
I'm a police officer.

862
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,508
Oh, I know that.

863
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:37,309
That's precisely why
you're here.

864
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:39,645
You see, Terri and I,
we have...

865
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,747
some merchandise
we'd like to sell.

866
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,649
Open, open, open.

867
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:45,551
Some bank certificates.

868
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,853
Now, there's a man
in Chicago

869
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:50,489
named Mr. Cronin
who would like to buy them.

870
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:52,824
But we're afraid
of approaching him.

871
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:54,193
Because we don't know
if he's being watched

872
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:55,194
by the police.

873
00:34:55,227 --> 00:34:58,264
So my question is...

874
00:34:58,297 --> 00:34:59,631
is Mr. Cronin
under surveillance?

875
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,471
I don't know.

876
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:12,544
Have you ever seen
the movie Marathon Man,

877
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:13,612
Mr. Monk?

878
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:16,382
No, is it good?
Let's watch it.

879
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:18,217
Let's--let's watch it now.

880
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,553
I'm not much
of a movie guy,

881
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:25,157
but I have some time now.

882
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:27,593
Who's in it?
Who's in that?

883
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,262
You're not gonna
watch it,

884
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:32,531
you're gonna live it.

885
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:37,203
Is Mr. Cronin
under surveillance?

886
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:38,204
Yes or no.

887
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:40,272
I don't know.

888
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:41,540
I wish I did.

889
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:45,377
I really do.
But I don't.

890
00:35:45,411 --> 00:35:47,446
Is Mr. Cronin
under surveillance?

891
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,549
No!

892
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,351
Is he under surveillance?

893
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:53,885
Yes.
Okay, yes.

894
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:56,522
Yes.
We know...

895
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:59,558
We know all about it.

896
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:01,760
You have to be careful.

897
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:03,795
You should be careful.

898
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,565
Now, I really wish
I could believe you, Mr. Monk.

899
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:11,303
Your teeth are perfect.

900
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:16,542
I don't see
a single cavity.

901
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:19,611
Is Mr. Cronin
under surveillance?

902
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:23,582
[making nonsensical sounds]

903
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:24,783
He's not saying anything.

904
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:26,952
Pass me the extractor please.

905
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,526
I still don't see
what's wrong

906
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,262
with the Randy Disher Project.

907
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:38,730
I never liked that name.
Even in high school.

908
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,634
Okay.

909
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:49,308
Okay, what about the
Randy Disher Experience?

910
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:51,543
How about Severe Tire Damage?

911
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:55,281
Okay, how about Mellow Knights
with a K?

912
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,687
I gotta say I'm leaning towards
the Randy Disher Experience.

913
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,555
How about this,
I'm gonna open up

914
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:07,559
a newspaper and the
first word I see...

915
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:10,396
that's our name.

916
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:11,530
Baghdad.

917
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:14,733
That's good actually.
I kind of like that.

918
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,935
Let me see that.

919
00:37:20,306 --> 00:37:23,375
$13 million
in bearer bonds stolen.

920
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:26,312
Bearer bonds.
Barry Bonds.

921
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:27,646
Not Barry Bonds.

922
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:28,980
They were saying
Bearer bonds!

923
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:31,583
All right!

924
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:33,685
All right, okay!
Wait, wait.

925
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:39,558
Your hands
are so dirty.

926
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:40,459
Excuse me?

927
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:42,528
Could you...

928
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:45,731
You gotta
wash your hands first.

929
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,933
Please.

930
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,535
You want me
to wash my hands.

931
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:50,536
Please.

932
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:52,070
I'm not gonna wash my hands,
okay?

933
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,639
Please.
I'm not washing my hands.

934
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:55,474
Okay, now,
just hold still.

935
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:57,509
We're not animals, here,
right?

936
00:37:57,543 --> 00:37:58,777
Please, I'm asking you.

937
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,512
I'm asking you!

938
00:38:00,546 --> 00:38:02,080
He did wash his hands
in Marathon Man.

939
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,649
I'll give you
Marathon Man.

940
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:06,518
It'll take--it'll take
five seconds--please.

941
00:38:06,552 --> 00:38:09,588
I'm asking you!

942
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:10,922
Look into your heart.
For God.

943
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:13,659
For the love of God.
For all that's holy.

944
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:16,328
Look into your heart.
Look into your heart.

945
00:38:16,362 --> 00:38:18,096
I'll wash my damn hands,
okay?

946
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,531
Oh!

947
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:25,604
Look, the lights are on.

948
00:38:31,577 --> 00:38:33,912
No!
No, not the wrong soap.

949
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:37,483
You gotta use
the anti-bacterial soap!

950
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:38,717
Not the wrong soap!
Give me the drill.

951
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,718
All right, this is
enough, already.

952
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:41,052
Just gimme the drill.

953
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:43,789
Not that soap.

954
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,992
Ah!
Ah!

955
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:47,926
[door opens]

956
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,629
Drop the drill!
Step away from the chair!

957
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,564
Easy.

958
00:38:52,598 --> 00:38:53,865
Get over here.

959
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:55,734
Down.
Down on your knees now.

960
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:56,802
Both of you.
You okay?

961
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,504
I don't have my cuffs.

962
00:38:58,537 --> 00:39:01,673
Here.

963
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:04,042
Give me your hands.

964
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:07,579
Mr. Monk!
It's okay, it's okay.

965
00:39:07,613 --> 00:39:08,914
It's all over.

966
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:11,049
It's all over.

967
00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:33,805
* I don't need a gun
to make me feel strong *

968
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,142
* I don't need a captain
shoot me down all day long *

969
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:41,847
* I don't need your moustache
don't you condescend to me *

970
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:48,654
* I don't need nobody
'cause baby I am free *

971
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:55,026
* No I don't need nobody
baby I am free *

972
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,829
*

973
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:12,644
Wow, that had
some good energy.

974
00:40:12,678 --> 00:40:14,746
Yeah, a lot of energy.

975
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:18,484
Let's watch it again
sometime.

976
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:20,719
It doesn't matter.

977
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,020
I mean, the band
broke up anyway.

978
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:23,455
We couldn't agree
on anything.

979
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:25,924
Name, what kind of music
to play.

980
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:28,927
Or whether or not
I should shut up.

981
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:32,764
Come here.

982
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:43,475
I believe this is yours.

983
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,178
Welcome back, Randy.

984
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:48,680
Welcome back.

985
00:40:48,714 --> 00:40:49,681
Are you okay?

986
00:40:49,715 --> 00:40:50,749
Mmm.

987
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,050
Loose tooth.

988
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,620
Huh?

989
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:55,754
I betcha that happened
when they knocked him out.

990
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,856
Oh, gosh, you gotta
see a dentist.

991
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,825
Mmm!
Nah.

992
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:01,693
Mmm-mm.
Mmm-mm.

993
00:41:01,727 --> 00:41:03,895
Mr. Monk, there's nothing
to be afraid of!

994
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:04,963
What--I'll be with you
the whole time.

995
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:06,798
What are the odds

996
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:08,634
of another dentist
torturing you?

997
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:11,670
