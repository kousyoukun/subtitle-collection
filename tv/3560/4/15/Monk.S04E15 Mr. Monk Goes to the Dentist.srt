1
00:00:03,631 --> 00:00:06,823
- We're ahead of schedule.
- That's a first, huh?

2
00:00:07,064 --> 00:00:08,899
You wanna grab some coffee?

3
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:11,028
No, I gotta get home.

4
00:00:11,063 --> 00:00:13,439
We're meeting the wedding planner.

5
00:00:13,474 --> 00:00:16,731
- I thought that was last night.
- No, last night was the caterer.

6
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:19,760
Should have taken my advice.
Should have just eloped.

7
00:00:19,795 --> 00:00:23,081
- Yeah, well, it's too late now.
- Now, it's not, man. You can do it.

8
00:00:23,116 --> 00:00:24,885
Hop on a plane tonight,
go to Vegas.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,978
Boom, it's all over.

10
00:00:27,013 --> 00:00:30,861
Rachel's mom would
never speak to me again.

11
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:32,534
That's the best argument to do it.

12
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:35,685
I've been trying to get my mother-in-law
to shut up for five years.

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,142
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's this?

14
00:00:37,177 --> 00:00:39,068
What the hell are they doing?

15
00:00:43,282 --> 00:00:45,031
- Hit the brakes!
- I'm trying.

16
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:46,459
Try the emergency brake!

17
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:49,048
This is Baker 4.
We're on Vinton and Hillside.

18
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:52,665
It's a hijacking.
I repeat, we are being hijacked.

19
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:55,192
They're jamming us.

20
00:01:07,913 --> 00:01:10,510
MONK Season 4 Epi. 15
Mr. Monk Goes to the Dentist

21
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:08,733
We just found the truck.
This been sitting here for three days.

22
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,404
Thanks. And they left most
of the cash.

23
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,912
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,456
And these are the drivers.

25
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:18,262
Yeah, the ME said they
put up a fight. I mean...

26
00:02:18,297 --> 00:02:20,723
blood everywhere
like there was a struggle.

27
00:02:20,758 --> 00:02:21,947
Well, good for them.

28
00:02:21,982 --> 00:02:24,929
Maybe they injured one of the bastards.
Let's check the hospitals.

29
00:02:24,964 --> 00:02:29,125
I want a list of all gunshot wounds,
knife wounds. - Yes, sir.

30
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:32,383
- You okay?
- Oh, toothache.

31
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:35,365
Wait, is that the same tooth?
I told you to take care of that.

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,941
Yeah, I am.
I'm chewing on the other side.

33
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:41,837
It's fine, I hardly notice it.

34
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:44,620
You're crying.

35
00:02:44,655 --> 00:02:46,992
Randy, you're no good to me like this.
Go to a dentist.

36
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:50,418
- I have an appointment Saturday.
- Oh, I get it.

37
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:52,090
You don't wanna use up
your sick days.

38
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:57,015
You're saving your sick days for when
you're not feeling sick, is that it?

39
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,096
I'm gonna go talk to Monk.
You make me wanna talk to Monk.

40
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:16,157
God, I just heard one of those guys
was about to get married.

41
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:18,103
Randy?

42
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,719
I know, I know, it's heartbreaking.
They were so young.

43
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:29,511
Sweetie, it's okay to cry.
It means you have a heart.

44
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:31,724
Here, look at me.

45
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,370
You're a compassionate person.
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

46
00:03:35,405 --> 00:03:39,531
- It hurts.
- I know. I know it hurts.

47
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:46,670
You don't want anybody to see you?

48
00:03:46,705 --> 00:03:48,398
I understand.

49
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:50,157
You know what? If anyone says anything,

50
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:52,368
we'll just say that you, uh...
- My tooth, oh...

51
00:03:52,403 --> 00:03:55,880
Yeah, perfect, that you
have a toothache. - Oh, god.

52
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:58,943
- God, this hurts.
- Okay, I think that's overdoing it.

53
00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:00,980
Oh, please, Jesus,
somebody just shoot me.

54
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:03,180
Randy, no one's gonna believe that.

55
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:06,076
There's some oil on the floor.

56
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:08,089
Is that a clue?
Is that important?

57
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:11,288
Nah, there's oil on the floor.

58
00:04:11,323 --> 00:04:13,524
I'll call the EPA.

59
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:15,249
So, do you, uh...

60
00:04:15,284 --> 00:04:17,932
any ideas about the robbery?

61
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:20,673
Did you notice the back bumper,
how damaged it was? - Yeah.

62
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:23,726
And these side mirrors are pushed in.

63
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:28,058
I don't think this
armored car was driven here.

64
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:29,851
- It wasn't?
- No.

65
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:36,219
I think it was carried somehow
in the back of a bigger truck.

66
00:04:36,254 --> 00:04:39,372
You see the tire tracks
from a larger vehicle.

67
00:04:39,407 --> 00:04:40,814
You're right.

68
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:45,941
It was probably an 18-wheeler
about 14 feet wide.

69
00:04:46,104 --> 00:04:50,468
So they brought the armored car here,
they unload it.

70
00:04:50,503 --> 00:04:54,956
How did they get the drivers
out of the cab?

71
00:04:58,391 --> 00:04:59,784
With this.

72
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:02,870
A piece of rubber tubing.

73
00:05:02,905 --> 00:05:05,665
They drilled the hole here.

74
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,013
In the plexiglas.

75
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:10,817
They gassed them out.

76
00:05:12,244 --> 00:05:13,765
Randy?

77
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,338
Yes, sir?

78
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,472
Bag this up.

79
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:22,641
He has a toothache. - Yeah, I know.
He's been bitching about it all week.

80
00:05:22,676 --> 00:05:25,410
- What, it's a real toothache?
- Yeah.

81
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:29,311
I can't believe you lied to me like that.
Why didn't you just say I have a toothache?

82
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:30,966
I did, like ten times.

83
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:35,083
Randy, if you don't take care
of this tooth immediately today,

84
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:37,819
I'm gonna rip it out myself, understand?

85
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:39,589
Fine.

86
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:42,985
What?

87
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:52,340
Mr. Disher?

88
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,855
- Yeah.
- Oh, good. I'm Terri.

89
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:57,943
Did you do all your paperwork?

90
00:05:57,978 --> 00:06:01,682
Both sides.
Good boy. - Yeah.

91
00:06:01,717 --> 00:06:04,033
Where's your receptionist?

92
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:06,458
Oh, our nighttime receptionist quit.

93
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:09,526
- Couldn't stand the excitement, huh?
- I guess not.

94
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:11,552
So you're gonna be in room B.

95
00:06:11,587 --> 00:06:13,947
That's between A and C.

96
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:15,958
Well, what if I get lost?

97
00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:18,515
You want me to draw you a map?

98
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,857
- Yeah, I think I can find it.
- Okay. I'll be right in.

99
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:32,102
Well, Mr. Disher, I'm Oliver Bloom.

100
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:33,601
Don't get up. Just kidding.

101
00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:35,555
- You're a lieutenant, am I right?
- Yeah.

102
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,353
I can usually guess within one rank.

103
00:06:37,388 --> 00:06:39,626
I see a lot of cops in here.
We're on the medical plan, you know.

104
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:41,890
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

105
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:44,203
Oh, that's not a problem.

106
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:47,054
We're open late on Tuesdays and Thursdays
in case of emergencies.

107
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:49,931
Also to keep Terri here off the streets.

108
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:52,025
- He worries about me.
- I do.

109
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,491
You know what I'm really worried about?
I worry about this bad boy right here.

110
00:06:56,526 --> 00:06:58,457
Your number three molar.

111
00:06:58,492 --> 00:07:00,609
Terri, can I have a light, please?

112
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:05,150
I want you to open wide,
just try to relax.

113
00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:09,351
A little wider.
Okay, just relax.

114
00:07:09,947 --> 00:07:12,207
Okay, okay.
A little sensitive.

115
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:14,564
Well, I hope you're not in love
with that tooth, lieutenant,

116
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:16,720
because I'm afraid it's gonna have to go.

117
00:07:16,755 --> 00:07:19,935
Now, we can either pull it next week,
or we can do it today.

118
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,613
The choice is yours.

119
00:07:21,648 --> 00:07:23,320
Let's do it now.

120
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:26,605
Okay, Randy, we're gonna
put you under for about 30 minutes.

121
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,254
You're not gonna feel a thing.

122
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:32,554
As a matter of fact, you're gonna
be back here every week for this.

123
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:36,014
And if you're a really good boy,
I'm gonna give you a sticker afterwards.

124
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:39,010
What if I'm a bad boy?

125
00:07:40,221 --> 00:07:41,885
Just breathe.

126
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,462
Breathe normally, relax.

127
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:46,391
I know it's hard with Terri
standing over you.

128
00:07:46,426 --> 00:07:48,727
Can you hear me?

129
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,458
Just relax, I want you
to take ten deep breaths, okay?

130
00:07:52,493 --> 00:07:54,081
One,

131
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:55,932
two,

132
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:58,290
three,

133
00:07:58,325 --> 00:08:00,484
four,

134
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,817
five...

135
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:09,459
Terri, I'm gonna need that angled
director probe again please.

136
00:08:09,494 --> 00:08:11,776
Angled director probe.

137
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:17,848
Doctor, wait, I think
he's coming awake again.

138
00:08:25,515 --> 00:08:27,171
Come on.

139
00:08:28,747 --> 00:08:30,106
Hey!

140
00:08:30,688 --> 00:08:33,354
- What are you doing here?
- What did you do with Barry Bonds?

141
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:35,180
I know he's here somewhere.

142
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,140
What did you do?
I know he's here.

143
00:08:37,175 --> 00:08:38,945
- I know he's here.
- What are you talking about?

144
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,408
- Barry Bonds.
- We don't know any Barry Bonds.

145
00:08:42,443 --> 00:08:44,790
He is worth $13 million.
What did you do with him?

146
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:47,089
- We're with a patient here.
- Yeah, we have a patient here.

147
00:08:47,124 --> 00:08:49,811
- We're really...
- Listen, Barry Bonds.

148
00:08:51,415 --> 00:08:52,877
Hey, hey.

149
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:57,119
Hey, cut it out.

150
00:08:57,755 --> 00:09:00,386
I'm a police officer.

151
00:09:02,498 --> 00:09:05,428
I'm a police officer.

152
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:09,425
Hey, sleeping beauty.

153
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,831
Welcome back.

154
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,934
Are you all right?

155
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:17,824
Am I all right?
Why wouldn't I be?

156
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:19,475
There was a man in here.

157
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,489
She has a man in here all the time.

158
00:09:23,548 --> 00:09:25,634
You...

159
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:27,240
you were fighting.

160
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,804
Well, there was a fight, all right.

161
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,230
Between me and this molar here.
It didn't wanna come out.

162
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:34,253
There's gonna be some
sensitivity for a few days.

163
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:36,658
I wrote you a prescription.
This should help with the pain.

164
00:09:36,693 --> 00:09:39,650
Now, don't take more
than one every four hours.

165
00:09:39,685 --> 00:09:41,873
Oh, and I almost forgot.

166
00:09:41,908 --> 00:09:44,116
Your sticker.

167
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,198
Captain, there are no reports
of any stolen trucks.

168
00:09:58,233 --> 00:09:59,867
Well, keep looking.
Widen the net.

169
00:09:59,902 --> 00:10:01,784
Start at Seattle and
work your way south.

170
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:04,226
Captain, here's a copy
of the updated manifest.

171
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:07,682
The cash was new, right? - Yes, sir,
it would have been easily traced.

172
00:10:07,717 --> 00:10:10,678
All they took were the negotiable
bank certificates over $10 million.

173
00:10:10,713 --> 00:10:12,284
All right, let's follow the money.

174
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:14,919
How many fences in the country
could handle a haul like this?

175
00:10:14,954 --> 00:10:16,446
- I'll find out.
- Captain?

176
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:18,163
Randy, welcome back.

177
00:10:18,198 --> 00:10:20,485
You're working with Patterson
on the bank certificates.

178
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,090
Get me Frank Davis
at the treasury department on the line.

179
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,298
And put a list together of all the fences.

180
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:25,666
Any fence in the country
who's got the balls...

181
00:10:25,701 --> 00:10:29,273
- Captain, do you have a minute?
- Yeah, what's up?

182
00:10:29,308 --> 00:10:33,779
- It's about my dentist, Dr. Bloom?
- Yeah?

183
00:10:34,357 --> 00:10:36,357
I think, um...

184
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:42,642
- I think he might...
- Did he touch you inappropriately?

185
00:10:42,677 --> 00:10:45,773
What? No, Jesus, no. No.

186
00:10:46,538 --> 00:10:48,848
I think he killed a guy.

187
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:51,647
- He what?
- It happened.

188
00:10:51,682 --> 00:10:54,543
I think that he, Dr. Bloom
and his assistant Terri?

189
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:57,619
I mean, I think they murdered someone.

190
00:10:57,929 --> 00:10:59,713
- You saw it?
- Yeah, sort of.

191
00:10:59,748 --> 00:11:02,104
I was sedated.

192
00:11:02,685 --> 00:11:04,948
You were sedated?

193
00:11:05,217 --> 00:11:08,900
Randy, one time, I was under anesthesia.
I thought my moustache was a chipmunk.

194
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:11,738
I was the Green Lantern once.

195
00:11:11,773 --> 00:11:14,753
It was great.
I didn't wanna wake up.

196
00:11:14,788 --> 00:11:17,795
Look, I was supposed
to be out for 30 minutes.

197
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,685
But I was under for almost two hours.

198
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,458
- Was there a body?
- No.

199
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:23,073
- Any signs of struggle?
- No.

200
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:25,175
- And who did they kill?
- I don't know.

201
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,362
It was a guy.
Male, caucasian, 5'11", 200 pounds.

202
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,619
They were arguing about Barry Bonds.
And I'm pretty sure that I can ID him.

203
00:11:32,654 --> 00:11:35,341
- The baseball player?
- Yeah.

204
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:38,935
I think this guy thought
Dr. Bloom kidnapped Barry Bonds.

205
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,729
I mean, they were arguing about
how much Barry Bonds was worth.

206
00:11:41,764 --> 00:11:45,977
Hey, you know, if your dentist played
baseball, you know what team he'd play for?

207
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,518
The Yanks. Get it?

208
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,485
It's not funny.

209
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,337
It's a little funny, Randy.

210
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:58,044
Look, why don't you, um...

211
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,881
take a walk.
Clear you head.

212
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,749
Here, drop this off at Monk's.
He's waiting for this.

213
00:12:03,784 --> 00:12:07,527
Then take the rest of the day off, okay?
Go to the movies, go to the beach.

214
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:09,958
Okay? Get out of here.

215
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:11,652
I'll call you later.

216
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,286
Is this everything? The whole file?

217
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:17,820
Yeah.

218
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:21,797
Monk, can I ask you a question?

219
00:12:21,832 --> 00:12:23,846
What do you normally charge?

220
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:26,949
You know, for someone
who wants to hire you.

221
00:12:26,984 --> 00:12:30,061
I mean, not the department.
A private party.

222
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:31,975
Like who?

223
00:12:32,174 --> 00:12:33,529
Like me.

224
00:12:33,564 --> 00:12:35,147
Is this about the dentist?

225
00:12:35,182 --> 00:12:39,367
The captain called us. He said you
had a reaction to the anesthesia.

226
00:12:39,402 --> 00:12:43,133
- You were probably hallucinating...
- No, I wasn't hallucinating.

227
00:12:43,168 --> 00:12:45,116
It really happened.

228
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,752
It was as real as you are right now
standing in front of me.

229
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:53,133
Randy, I'm not standing.

230
00:12:56,631 --> 00:13:00,365
But if you need my help...
you don't have to pay me.

231
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,348
All you have to do is ask.

232
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:08,083
I mean, you're one of my oldest friends.
I've known you for years.

233
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,364
Thank you. I want you to come back
to the dentist's office with me.

234
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,624
Let me finish.

235
00:13:13,808 --> 00:13:17,747
Unfortunately, at the moment,
I have a lot of things on my plate.

236
00:13:17,782 --> 00:13:19,567
No, you don't.

237
00:13:19,602 --> 00:13:22,916
Well, I have this armored car thing.

238
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:25,560
I have to read this whole file
that's about 120 pages.

239
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:28,068
And I just found a typo, by the way.

240
00:13:28,103 --> 00:13:31,595
And I have to replace
the lint filter on my dryer.

241
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,114
Filters do not replace themselves.

242
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:36,052
- Mr. Monk, can I talk to you for a minute?
- I have to talk to Natalie for a minute.

243
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:37,669
- Privately?
- What?

244
00:13:37,704 --> 00:13:39,288
In the kitchen?

245
00:13:39,323 --> 00:13:42,292
- Now.
- Okay. - Go.

246
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:49,782
Mr. Monk, this is Randy we're talking
about. He would do anything for you.

247
00:13:49,817 --> 00:13:52,780
And I would do anything for him
except this, Natalie. I can't do it.

248
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:54,478
I have a thing about dentists.

249
00:13:54,513 --> 00:13:56,649
- You have a thing about everything.
- That's true,

250
00:13:56,684 --> 00:14:00,381
but dentists are in a separate
category altogether, okay?

251
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,893
I can't even discuss it.
I can't even think about discussing it.

252
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:05,888
I can't even talk about
thinking about discussing it.

253
00:14:05,923 --> 00:14:07,839
Mr. Monk, everybody's afraid of dentists.

254
00:14:07,874 --> 00:14:09,640
Not like this.
Not like this.

255
00:14:09,675 --> 00:14:11,230
Okay, okay, okay.
How afraid are you?

256
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:12,907
On a scale of 1 to 10.

257
00:14:12,942 --> 00:14:16,178
10. I am so far beyond 10,
I laugh at your 10s.

258
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:19,160
I lie awake at night dreaming about 10s.

259
00:14:19,195 --> 00:14:22,039
The chair and the probing and
the drilling and the rinsing.

260
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:23,948
Okay, Mr. Monk, what do you do
when you get a cavity?

261
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:26,204
I don't get a cavity.
I don't get cavities.

262
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:29,111
I brush my teeth 12 times a day
and I floss every 90 minutes.

263
00:14:29,146 --> 00:14:32,306
- So you've never been to a dentist.
- Once, when I was 12.

264
00:14:32,341 --> 00:14:33,818
How'd that go?

265
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:35,599
Not well.

266
00:14:35,634 --> 00:14:38,478
You know, this is ridiculous.
We're just gonna go there and look around.

267
00:14:38,513 --> 00:14:41,102
You're not a patient.
You're not sitting in the chair.

268
00:14:41,137 --> 00:14:42,980
There's no probing.
There's no drilling.

269
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,398
I'll be with you the whole time.

270
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:47,656
But I... - No.

271
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:54,047
He's happy to do it.

272
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:55,906
Great.

273
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:06,826
I don't see anything.

274
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:09,989
It happened in the other room.
Room B.

275
00:15:10,024 --> 00:15:12,168
What do you think?

276
00:15:12,432 --> 00:15:14,579
Psst, Mr. Monk.

277
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:19,333
I'm pretty sure this is how the Nazis
decorated their bunkers.

278
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:21,803
Don't look at that.
Look, look, look, look down.

279
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,128
Look at the carpet.
What a beautiful carpet.

280
00:15:24,163 --> 00:15:26,324
- It is a beautiful carpet.
- Right? Is that better?

281
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,237
That is better.

282
00:15:29,401 --> 00:15:31,976
Oh, highlights for children.

283
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:34,277
Oh, find the hidden picture.
I used to love these.

284
00:15:34,312 --> 00:15:36,996
Where is the egg beater?

285
00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:39,515
It's under the sled.

286
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,499
You're right.

287
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:45,722
And the umbrella is in the cloud
above the snowman.

288
00:15:45,757 --> 00:15:48,117
And the fish is next to the ice skate.

289
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:49,716
Okay, how are you doing that?

290
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:53,903
I read that same issue 35 years ago.

291
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:56,051
It was in the...

292
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:01,136
it was in...
the dentist's office.

293
00:16:01,171 --> 00:16:02,606
Natalie, I can't do this.

294
00:16:02,641 --> 00:16:04,182
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no,
you can do this.

295
00:16:04,217 --> 00:16:06,331
You can do this.
You're doing great.

296
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,355
Okay, here, here, here, sit down
and think about something else, okay?

297
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,412
Here, I brought the case file.

298
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:13,760
Concentrate on this.

299
00:16:16,368 --> 00:16:19,356
Lieutenant. You back for more?

300
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:21,239
No, no.

301
00:16:21,274 --> 00:16:23,272
Actually, I think
I just left my cell phone...

302
00:16:23,307 --> 00:16:25,048
in the chair in room B.

303
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,435
Oh, well, it's empty now
if you wanna take a look.

304
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,774
Great.

305
00:16:29,843 --> 00:16:33,143
Oh, I'm Natalie, I'm just gonna help him.
He can't ever find anything.

306
00:16:33,178 --> 00:16:35,721
I'm gonna be right back.
I'm gonna be right here. Are you okay?

307
00:16:35,756 --> 00:16:39,229
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

308
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,724
Okay, I was in the chair.

309
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:56,776
And they were fighting over there.

310
00:16:57,764 --> 00:17:01,347
Okay, well, I don't see anything.

311
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:06,385
He bought new equipment.

312
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:12,037
He bought new equipment to replace
the stuff that got broken during the fight.

313
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,210
Maybe.

314
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:27,598
- What's that?
- It's a drill.

315
00:17:28,407 --> 00:17:30,611
Don't be afraid.

316
00:17:30,646 --> 00:17:32,850
I'm not afraid.

317
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,223
Don't be afraid.

318
00:17:36,163 --> 00:17:38,436
Don't be afraid.

319
00:17:47,473 --> 00:17:48,872
Mr. Monk, it's okay.

320
00:17:48,907 --> 00:17:50,502
We're gonna go home now.
You can let go.

321
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,593
No, no, we're not going anywhere.
He hasn't seen anything yet.

322
00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:55,415
- I think he's seen enough.
- Is there a problem?

323
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,168
Oh, no, no, I just left
my cell phone in the other room.

324
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,074
Dr. Bloom, this is Adrian Monk.
He's a friend of mine.

325
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:06,180
The Adrian Monk, the detective?
It's a pleasure to meet you.

326
00:18:08,278 --> 00:18:10,005
Apparently, the pleasure's all mine.

327
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,220
No, he just has a little
thing about dentists.

328
00:18:12,255 --> 00:18:14,153
You know what?
It happens to me all the time.

329
00:18:14,188 --> 00:18:15,959
I don't take it personally.

330
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,235
Let me help you with that.

331
00:18:19,138 --> 00:18:21,178
Oh, are you working
on the armored car case?

332
00:18:21,213 --> 00:18:24,581
I've been reading about it.
I'm a bit of a true crime aficionado.

333
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:26,671
I'm sorry, that's just classified.

334
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:30,778
Well, you got a couple of hobbies
then, huh? True crime and baseball.

335
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:32,286
Baseball?

336
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:37,634
Well, yeah, I'm sure I heard you guys
talking about Barry Bonds yesterday.

337
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:41,102
Well, you know what? People hear a lot of
crazy things when they're under sedation.

338
00:18:41,137 --> 00:18:44,020
They say a lot of crazy things too.
I should write a book, really.

339
00:18:44,055 --> 00:18:45,811
Yes, sir, I understand.

340
00:18:45,846 --> 00:18:48,091
Okay, we're on our way.
We gotta go, that was the captain.

341
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:50,865
- Oh, we gotta go.
- Okay.

342
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:53,148
Take care.

343
00:18:58,634 --> 00:19:01,098
A couple of fishermen just found him.

344
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:04,809
These two bruises, ten inches apart.

345
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:09,010
There's another set of bruises
exactly ten inches apart.

346
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:10,743
Yeah, what caused that?

347
00:19:10,778 --> 00:19:15,255
Well, it must be something
ten inches apart. - Thanks a lot.

348
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,664
Well, what do you got?
You said it was important.

349
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:20,215
I found this in his trousers.

350
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,548
It was in his pants cuff.
It's plexiglas.

351
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:27,931
- It's gotta be one of the hijackers.
- He drilled the hole.

352
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,809
So who is he?

353
00:19:29,844 --> 00:19:31,903
Turn him over.

354
00:19:34,448 --> 00:19:36,655
- I don't recognize him, do you?
- No.

355
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,263
Oh, my god.

356
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,778
That's the guy.
That's the guy from the dentist's office.

357
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,859
Randy, I told you to
take some time off. - No, no.

358
00:19:44,894 --> 00:19:48,114
Captain, that's the guy.
I told you I could ID him.

359
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:49,897
And that is definitely the guy.

360
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:52,005
What, this is the guy
that your dentist killed

361
00:19:52,006 --> 00:19:53,858
along with his hygienist?
- That's right.

362
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,860
This the guy that they
killed in front of you

363
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,784
while you were in the chair.
- That's right.

364
00:19:57,819 --> 00:20:00,729
All right, because Dr. Bloom
kidnapped Barry Bonds,

365
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:02,517
and they were arguing
about the ransom money, right?

366
00:20:02,552 --> 00:20:07,066
Yeah, what, is that so crazy? What
the hell are you laughing at, Peterson?

367
00:20:07,197 --> 00:20:09,517
I'm not crazy. - Okay, nobody said
you were crazy, Randy.

368
00:20:09,552 --> 00:20:12,582
Out loud. - While you were there you
should've had them put some wisdom teeth in.

369
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:14,647
Hey, you can't even spell
wisdom teeth, Downey.

370
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:16,396
- All right, look, Natalie.
- What?

371
00:20:16,431 --> 00:20:19,415
You and Monk were there, right?
Did you notice anything?

372
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:24,691
No, I wasn't really on my game.
I have this thing about dentists.

373
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:27,336
Kroger calls it a supermegaphobia.

374
00:20:27,371 --> 00:20:31,482
If germs are here and snakes are here,
the dentists are...

375
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:34,153
You see that branch up there?
The second one from the top?

376
00:20:34,188 --> 00:20:35,664
The one above that one.

377
00:20:35,699 --> 00:20:39,802
Captain, are you going to
investigate this or not?

378
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:45,151
Randy, you were sedated.
You couldn't have seen anything.

379
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:49,871
Fine, I quit.

380
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:51,853
- You what?
- No, I quit.

381
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:55,186
I'm sick and tired of being treated
like the village idiot.

382
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:56,899
- Here's my gun and my badge.
- Randy, come on.

383
00:20:56,934 --> 00:20:58,458
I'm not a joke.

384
00:20:58,493 --> 00:21:00,560
I'm not here to entertain you.

385
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:02,426
I'm a homicide detective.

386
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,649
Randy, don't be ridiculous.

387
00:21:04,684 --> 00:21:07,005
Take it.

388
00:21:09,455 --> 00:21:11,650
Randy.

389
00:21:14,692 --> 00:21:16,454
Randy.

390
00:21:21,508 --> 00:21:23,833
Captain, they just ID'ed the body.

391
00:21:23,868 --> 00:21:25,336
Are you ready for this?

392
00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:26,791
It's Denny Jardeen.

393
00:21:26,826 --> 00:21:29,600
- Ooh, I know that name.
- Yeah, he's an ex-cop.

394
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:33,498
Worked the Mission District.
He was bad news.

395
00:21:33,837 --> 00:21:38,387
He was charged five times.
Excessive force, conduct unbecoming.

396
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,481
Took an early retirement four years ago.

397
00:21:41,516 --> 00:21:43,244
Thanks.

398
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:48,199
- What's he doing?
- Flossing.

399
00:21:48,234 --> 00:21:50,980
He's determined never to
go back to a dentist again.

400
00:21:51,015 --> 00:21:54,197
- Uh, just pretend I'm not here.
- Monk, cut it out, I mean it.

401
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:56,899
This is a floss-free zone.

402
00:21:57,093 --> 00:21:59,330
- Since when?
- Since right now.

403
00:21:59,365 --> 00:22:01,343
Cut it out.

404
00:22:04,202 --> 00:22:06,701
- What's this?
- That's nothing.

405
00:22:06,736 --> 00:22:10,495
Background check Oliver Bloom.
You're checking out the dentist?

406
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,051
Yeah, I figured it couldn't hurt
to check him out.

407
00:22:13,086 --> 00:22:15,121
You're doing this for Randy, aren't you?

408
00:22:15,156 --> 00:22:16,789
Why don't you just call him?

409
00:22:16,824 --> 00:22:18,981
Because he quit.

410
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:20,903
Randy is an adult.

411
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:23,659
He made a decision and I respect it.

412
00:22:23,694 --> 00:22:25,444
You miss him, I can tell.

413
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:28,310
Look, Natalie, it's not like
we were going steady, okay?

414
00:22:28,345 --> 00:22:30,760
We worked together.
He was just another cop.

415
00:22:30,795 --> 00:22:32,803
That is not true.

416
00:22:32,838 --> 00:22:35,498
You're right, it's not true.
He's not just another cop,

417
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:39,800
he was the single most annoying
human being to ever wear a badge.

418
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:47,196
Present company excepted.

419
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:50,483
Okay, you guys,
let's try this new one.

420
00:22:50,518 --> 00:22:52,977
I printed up some lyric sheets.

421
00:22:53,182 --> 00:22:55,975
Why do we need lyric sheets?
You're the only one singing.

422
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:00,032
Just so you can follow along.
So you know what it's about.

423
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:03,255
- We're making a statement.
- We are?

424
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,437
Okay, let's do it, from the top.

425
00:23:07,472 --> 00:23:09,032
A five, six, seven, eight.
5, 6, 7, 8

426
00:23:09,067 --> 00:23:12,088
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What was that?

427
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:14,866
- Counting off. - Five, six,
seven, eight? - 5, 6, 7, 8?

428
00:23:14,901 --> 00:23:17,336
- That's for dancing.
- No, it's not.

429
00:23:17,371 --> 00:23:20,432
You're supposed to go,
"one, two, three, four."

430
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:22,038
Come on, what's the difference?

431
00:23:22,073 --> 00:23:23,740
It's rock 'n roll, man.

432
00:23:23,775 --> 00:23:26,640
Let's do that blues song
we used to do.

433
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:28,816
Guys.
Guys, guys, guys!

434
00:23:28,851 --> 00:23:32,423
Hey, guys, guys, why don't we just
stick to the original material, okay?

435
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,147
I mean, that's what the people wanna hear.

436
00:23:34,182 --> 00:23:37,501
What people? Randy,
we're in my stepfather's garage.

437
00:23:37,536 --> 00:23:40,940
Well, Aaron, there might
be people one day.

438
00:23:40,975 --> 00:23:42,879
I mean, touring, record deal?

439
00:23:42,914 --> 00:23:45,004
Come on, guys, wasn't that the dream?

440
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,368
Maybe 17 years ago in 12th grade?

441
00:23:49,403 --> 00:23:51,294
Well, you know what?

442
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,201
I still believe in the dream.

443
00:23:53,236 --> 00:23:55,754
I mean, I believe in
the Randy Disher project.

444
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:59,048
- Come on, I quit my job for this.
- Big mistake.

445
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:01,691
All right, let's just do it, okay?

446
00:24:01,726 --> 00:24:03,472
From the top.

447
00:24:03,507 --> 00:24:06,886
If you say "five, six,
seven, eight" again, I quit.

448
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:08,333
I'm just telling you.

449
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,305
That's good. You know what?
Do you wanna be the lead singer?

450
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,724
Excuse me.

451
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,920
Can I talk to Mick Jagger for a second?

452
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,406
Yeah, sure.

453
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:20,922
All right, guys, take a break, huh?

454
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,783
Oh, it's a really good job
so far, though. Really good.

455
00:24:27,637 --> 00:24:30,227
- How's it going?
- It's good.

456
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:31,999
It's great. I mean, I should
have done this years ago.

457
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:33,857
Yeah, it's pretty exciting.

458
00:24:33,892 --> 00:24:39,918
Um, you gotta send me a T-shirt
or a hat or something.

459
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,702
Or whatever.

460
00:24:42,737 --> 00:24:45,180
Um, listen, I thought
you might be interested.

461
00:24:45,181 --> 00:24:47,468
We caught a break on
the armored car thing.

462
00:24:47,503 --> 00:24:50,193
We identified the body.
Guy's name is Denny Jardeen.

463
00:24:50,228 --> 00:24:51,746
He's an ex-cop.

464
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:55,825
He's got a cousin who's done some time
who works for a trucking company.

465
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,477
So we're gonna go pick him up.
I thought you'd like to come along.

466
00:24:59,512 --> 00:25:00,905
Why?

467
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,150
I mean, I'm not a cop anymore, Leland.

468
00:25:03,185 --> 00:25:05,047
Captain.

469
00:25:05,082 --> 00:25:06,921
Look at my notebook.

470
00:25:06,956 --> 00:25:10,854
No more witness statements.
Just lyrics and song ideas now.

471
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:14,732
- You're writing songs?
- Yeah, I wrote 17 last night.

472
00:25:14,767 --> 00:25:16,622
I'm on fire.

473
00:25:16,657 --> 00:25:18,822
I'm sure you are.

474
00:25:18,857 --> 00:25:25,227
Uh, I also wanted to apologize
about the dentist.

475
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:29,329
It's just that over the years
you've had...

476
00:25:29,364 --> 00:25:31,838
- so many unique theories.
- I wasn't hallucinating.

477
00:25:31,873 --> 00:25:35,833
Randy, I checked Dr. Bloom out
myself on my own time.

478
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,666
The guy is clean.

479
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:42,109
He's got no priors.
He's never been in trouble.

480
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:46,291
I just wanted you to know
that I took you seriously.

481
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:50,349
The fact is...

482
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:53,651
I miss you, I need you.

483
00:25:57,932 --> 00:26:00,211
Well, it's too late.

484
00:26:00,246 --> 00:26:01,794
I've moved on.

485
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:03,889
I mean, the band's my life now.

486
00:26:03,924 --> 00:26:07,007
You're more than welcome to come
and have a listen if you want.

487
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:08,981
Come on in, be my guest.

488
00:26:09,016 --> 00:26:10,890
Have a seat.

489
00:26:12,301 --> 00:26:14,762
Okay.
How you doing?

490
00:26:14,797 --> 00:26:16,193
Hey.

491
00:26:17,553 --> 00:26:20,092
I should warn you,
you might not like what you hear.

492
00:26:20,127 --> 00:26:23,901
It's pretty powerful stuff.
You might not be able to handle it.

493
00:26:23,936 --> 00:26:25,941
All right, let's rock it out.

494
00:26:25,976 --> 00:26:27,361
From the top.

495
00:26:27,396 --> 00:26:29,273
One, two, three, four.

496
00:26:29,308 --> 00:26:31,040
Five, six, seven, eight.

497
00:26:31,075 --> 00:26:34,029
"I'm tired of sucking up"

498
00:26:34,064 --> 00:26:38,130
"and I'm tired of sucking up
and working for the man"

499
00:26:38,165 --> 00:26:41,845
"keeping people down
'cause the law says I can"

500
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,402
"cuff my brothers and sisters
that's not the way to be"

501
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,445
"but honey those days are gone"

502
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,118
"'cause baby I am free"

503
00:26:52,658 --> 00:26:56,283
"I don't need a badge
to tell me wrong from right"

504
00:26:56,318 --> 00:26:59,990
"I don't need a badge
to tell me day from night"

505
00:27:00,025 --> 00:27:03,671
"I don't need a badge
because my eyes can see"

506
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:09,775
"I don't need a badge
'cause baby I am free"

507
00:27:13,504 --> 00:27:17,105
All right, that was good.
That wasn't too bad.

508
00:27:18,978 --> 00:27:21,037
That was great.

509
00:27:26,095 --> 00:27:28,143
Okay, now, before you even
knock on the door,

510
00:27:28,178 --> 00:27:30,697
I want you to douse this handkerchief
with the chloroform.

511
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,563
Just like this, okay?

512
00:27:32,598 --> 00:27:36,581
20 ccs, and make sure
he really inhales it.

513
00:27:36,616 --> 00:27:39,101
I don't know about this.

514
00:27:39,335 --> 00:27:41,088
Well, we have to do it,
there's no choice.

515
00:27:41,123 --> 00:27:44,909
No, no, I know.
I mean, I don't know if 20 ccs is enough.

516
00:27:44,944 --> 00:27:46,943
How do you know he's gonna talk?

517
00:27:46,978 --> 00:27:48,462
Did you see him?

518
00:27:48,497 --> 00:27:50,748
He couldn't even shake my hand.
He was a mess. - Yeah.

519
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:53,061
You get Adrian Monk in here,

520
00:27:53,096 --> 00:27:55,503
and I'll make him talk.

521
00:27:56,434 --> 00:28:01,605
Neal, your fingerprints were all over
the warehouse and on the armored car.

522
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,377
You could hire the
best lawyer in the city.

523
00:28:03,378 --> 00:28:05,350
It's not gonna make those
fingerprints disappear.

524
00:28:05,385 --> 00:28:09,028
It is all over and you know it.

525
00:28:11,994 --> 00:28:17,898
Okay, I was there.
But I didn't do the two guards, man.

526
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:21,043
- I tried to stop him.
- Stop who?

527
00:28:21,078 --> 00:28:22,727
Denny.

528
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:25,518
Denny Jardeen.

529
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:29,010
One of the guards fought back and he
went postal, man. And started shooting.

530
00:28:29,045 --> 00:28:31,441
Where's the money, Neal?

531
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,384
Denny's got it.

532
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:36,988
He's keeping it in a shed back behind
his place until we all split it up.

533
00:28:37,023 --> 00:28:41,713
I got some bad news for you, Neal.
Denny is dead.

534
00:28:42,065 --> 00:28:44,651
Denny? - And there's no money
in that little tool shed.

535
00:28:44,686 --> 00:28:46,676
We've already ripped it apart.

536
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:48,487
Now that's impossible.

537
00:28:48,522 --> 00:28:52,888
Looks like somebody in your
little sewing circle got greedy.

538
00:28:53,326 --> 00:28:57,343
You can't trust anybody
these days, can you?

539
00:29:15,107 --> 00:29:17,357
Oh, Mr. Monk.

540
00:29:17,392 --> 00:29:19,631
I know it's late.
Can I come in?

541
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:21,554
Of course, of course.

542
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:23,088
Thank you.

543
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:28,554
What, what is it?

544
00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:31,294
Lieutenant Disher was right.

545
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:33,922
Dr. Bloom killed a man two days ago.

546
00:29:33,957 --> 00:29:36,159
And I don't even know who it was.

547
00:29:36,194 --> 00:29:39,651
I mean, I'd never seen him
before or anything.

548
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,819
- I just don't know where else to go.
- Yeah.

549
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:49,033
Yeah, are you gonna be crying a lot?

550
00:29:49,068 --> 00:29:51,252
Maybe you wanna lean over the sink.

551
00:29:51,287 --> 00:29:52,918
No, no, I'm fine.
I'm sorry.

552
00:29:52,953 --> 00:29:54,542
I'm just scared to death.

553
00:29:54,577 --> 00:29:56,665
- Yeah, I'll call the captain, right?
- No!

554
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,814
No, Dr. Bloom would kill me.
You can't.

555
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:00,336
Oh, it's okay.

556
00:30:00,371 --> 00:30:03,217
The police will protect you.

557
00:30:03,252 --> 00:30:04,975
Oh, what is that?

558
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,591
- What, what?
- I don't know.

559
00:30:06,626 --> 00:30:09,004
- What is it?
- I don't, it's right...

560
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,867
it's a something on your face.
Like a smudge.

561
00:30:12,902 --> 00:30:14,597
Smudge. - Yeah.

562
00:30:14,632 --> 00:30:17,628
No. No, you're not getting it.
It's right there.

563
00:30:17,663 --> 00:30:19,667
- Did I get it?
- No.

564
00:30:19,702 --> 00:30:23,481
Here, I'll do it.
Hold on. Okay.

565
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:26,279
Did you get it?

566
00:30:26,314 --> 00:30:30,131
- No?
- No, it's right there.

567
00:30:32,942 --> 00:30:34,605
Chloroform.

568
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,436
You're drugging me.

569
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:39,681
Just relax.

570
00:30:39,954 --> 00:30:41,852
Did you get it?

571
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:48,385
Did I get it?

572
00:30:51,534 --> 00:30:53,955
Did I get it?

573
00:30:57,132 --> 00:30:59,287
Did I get it.

574
00:31:04,706 --> 00:31:07,203
- Natalie!
- Captain, is Mr. Monk here?

575
00:31:07,238 --> 00:31:09,796
What would Monk be doing here?
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

576
00:31:09,831 --> 00:31:11,971
I called his house to
read him tomorrow's weather

577
00:31:11,972 --> 00:31:13,983
report like I always
do, but he didn't answer.

578
00:31:14,018 --> 00:31:19,102
So I go over there, the door's open.
The light's on, but he's not home.

579
00:31:19,137 --> 00:31:21,648
The door was open?

580
00:31:55,077 --> 00:31:58,144
Thank you for waiting.
The doctor will be right with you.

581
00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:01,136
There's no rush.

582
00:32:09,313 --> 00:32:11,627
Why are you doing this?

583
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:15,758
Why are you doing this?

584
00:32:16,281 --> 00:32:17,834
Please.

585
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,800
Please.

586
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,600
What are you gonna do?

587
00:32:26,007 --> 00:32:30,352
I didn't really have a smudge, did I?

588
00:32:30,387 --> 00:32:31,832
You should be flattered.

589
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:35,039
The doctor doesn't usually
come in this late.

590
00:32:35,074 --> 00:32:37,656
Especially for new patients.

591
00:32:37,691 --> 00:32:40,047
That tooth.

592
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:47,979
The roots are about
ten inches apart, aren't they?

593
00:32:48,014 --> 00:32:49,994
If you say so.

594
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:53,788
I get it now.
I know what happened.

595
00:32:53,823 --> 00:32:57,641
The drivers fought back
during the hijacking.

596
00:32:57,676 --> 00:33:00,601
Denny Jardeen got hit in the face.

597
00:33:00,636 --> 00:33:03,392
He must have knocked a tooth loose.

598
00:33:03,929 --> 00:33:09,527
So Jardeen came here to get
his tooth fixed. Makes sense.

599
00:33:09,562 --> 00:33:13,845
He's an ex-cop,
and you're on the medical plan.

600
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,637
He must have talked in his sleep.

601
00:33:16,672 --> 00:33:20,195
Dr. Bloom said a lot of patients do.
He told you everything.

602
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:23,871
About the robbery,
where they hid the money,

603
00:33:23,906 --> 00:33:26,872
it must have been like
winning the lottery.

604
00:33:26,907 --> 00:33:28,878
If you say so.

605
00:33:28,913 --> 00:33:33,879
That night, you went to Jardeen's house,
found the money, figured it was safe.

606
00:33:33,914 --> 00:33:37,403
That he'd never remember
telling you anything.

607
00:33:37,438 --> 00:33:39,133
But you were wrong.

608
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:41,520
He did remember.

609
00:33:41,788 --> 00:33:45,657
Or maybe, when the money
went missing,

610
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:48,327
he just figured it out.

611
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:54,763
He came back here Tuesday night
while you were working on Randy.

612
00:33:59,449 --> 00:34:01,578
Randy witnessed the whole thing,
sort of.

613
00:34:01,613 --> 00:34:07,592
He was right about everything,
wasn't he?

614
00:34:08,561 --> 00:34:10,629
If you say so.

615
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,470
Hello, again, Mr. Monk.

616
00:34:16,344 --> 00:34:20,077
Is it true that you've only
been to the dentist once before? - Yeah.

617
00:34:20,112 --> 00:34:23,159
I gather it wasn't a good experience.

618
00:34:23,465 --> 00:34:25,669
Well, this'll be much worse.

619
00:34:25,704 --> 00:34:27,326
I'm...

620
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,542
I'm a police officer.

621
00:34:29,577 --> 00:34:30,999
Oh, I know that.

622
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:32,845
That's precisely why you're here.

623
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,687
You see, Terri and I, we have...
some merchandise we'd like to sell.

624
00:34:36,722 --> 00:34:38,278
Open, open, open.

625
00:34:38,313 --> 00:34:40,597
Some bank certificates.

626
00:34:40,632 --> 00:34:45,435
Now, there's a man in Chicago named
Mr. Cronin who would like to buy them.

627
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,655
But we're afraid of approaching him.

628
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:50,048
Because we don't know
if he's being watched by the police.

629
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:52,536
So my question is...

630
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:56,156
is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?

631
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,302
I don't know.

632
00:35:05,664 --> 00:35:07,820
Have you ever seen
the movie 'Marathon man', Mr. Monk?

633
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,516
No, is it good?

634
00:35:09,551 --> 00:35:11,163
Let's watch it.

635
00:35:11,198 --> 00:35:13,225
Let's, let's watch it now.

636
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,643
I'm not much of a movie guy,

637
00:35:16,678 --> 00:35:19,635
but I have some time now.

638
00:35:19,814 --> 00:35:21,425
Who's in it?

639
00:35:21,626 --> 00:35:23,057
Who's in that?

640
00:35:23,092 --> 00:35:26,887
You're not gonna watch it,
you're gonna live it.

641
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,487
Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?
Yes or no.

642
00:35:32,522 --> 00:35:34,138
I don't know.

643
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:39,053
I wish I did. I really do.

644
00:35:39,088 --> 00:35:41,010
But I don't know.

645
00:35:41,045 --> 00:35:44,479
- Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?
- No!

646
00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:48,862
- Is he under surveillance?
- Yes. Okay, yes.

647
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,690
Yes. We know...

648
00:35:50,725 --> 00:35:54,022
we know all about it.

649
00:35:54,057 --> 00:35:56,425
You have to be careful.

650
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,281
You should be careful.

651
00:35:58,316 --> 00:36:02,084
Now, I really wish
I could believe you, Mr. Monk.

652
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:05,808
Your teeth are perfect.

653
00:36:06,857 --> 00:36:09,670
I don't see a single cavity.

654
00:36:11,521 --> 00:36:14,669
Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?

655
00:36:18,312 --> 00:36:20,138
He's not saying anything.

656
00:36:20,173 --> 00:36:22,580
Pass me the extractor please.

657
00:36:28,224 --> 00:36:31,071
I still don't see what's wrong
with the Randy Disher project.

658
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,848
I never liked that name.

659
00:36:32,883 --> 00:36:35,124
Even in high school.

660
00:36:35,907 --> 00:36:37,336
Okay.

661
00:36:40,745 --> 00:36:44,119
Okay, what about
the Randy Disher experience?

662
00:36:44,154 --> 00:36:46,217
How about severe tire damage?

663
00:36:46,252 --> 00:36:50,730
Okay, how about mellow knights with a K?

664
00:36:53,031 --> 00:36:55,749
I gotta say I'm leaning towards
the Randy Disher experience.

665
00:36:55,784 --> 00:36:57,150
How about this?

666
00:36:57,185 --> 00:37:02,135
I'm gonna open up a newspaper
and the first word I see...

667
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,578
that's our name.

668
00:37:05,446 --> 00:37:07,297
Baghdad.

669
00:37:07,332 --> 00:37:08,825
That's good actually.
I kind of like that.

670
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,629
- Baghdad.
- Let me see that.

671
00:37:14,611 --> 00:37:17,908
$13 million in bearer bonds stolen.

672
00:37:17,943 --> 00:37:20,729
Bearer bonds. Barry Bonds.

673
00:37:20,764 --> 00:37:22,639
Not Barry bonds.

674
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:24,594
They were saying bearer bonds!

675
00:37:24,629 --> 00:37:29,326
All right!
All right, okay! Wait, wait.

676
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,639
Your hands are so dirty.

677
00:37:34,803 --> 00:37:36,956
- Excuse me?
- Could you...

678
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:42,622
you gotta wash your hands first.
Please.

679
00:37:42,947 --> 00:37:44,880
- You want me to wash my hands.
- Please.

680
00:37:44,915 --> 00:37:47,197
- I'm not gonna wash my hands, okay?
- Please.

681
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:50,527
I'm not washing my hands.
Okay, now, just hold still.

682
00:37:50,562 --> 00:37:54,107
We're not animals, here, right?
Please, I'm asking you.

683
00:37:54,142 --> 00:37:56,015
I'm asking you.

684
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:58,574
- He did wash his hands in Marathon man.
- Don't give me "In Marathon Man."

685
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,227
I'm not gonna wash my hand
when I'm torturing him.

686
00:38:00,228 --> 00:38:01,654
It'll take, it'll take
five seconds, please.

687
00:38:01,689 --> 00:38:04,020
I'm asking you!

688
00:38:04,055 --> 00:38:07,243
Look into your heart. For god.
For the love of god.

689
00:38:07,278 --> 00:38:09,679
For all that's holy.
Look into your heart.

690
00:38:09,714 --> 00:38:13,453
- Look into your heart.
- I'll wash my damn hands, okay?

691
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,516
Look, the lights are on.

692
00:38:26,477 --> 00:38:29,254
No! No, not the wrong soap.

693
00:38:29,289 --> 00:38:33,428
- You gotta use the anti-bacterial soap!
- Give me the drill. - Not the wrong soap!

694
00:38:33,463 --> 00:38:35,650
All right, this is enough, already.
Just give me the drill.

695
00:38:35,685 --> 00:38:37,907
Not that soap.

696
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:45,659
Drop the drill!
Step away from the chair!

697
00:38:45,694 --> 00:38:47,358
- Don't move, Natalie. Stay there.
- Easy, you too.

698
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:48,974
Get over here.

699
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:50,956
Down. Down on your knees now.
Both of you.

700
00:38:50,991 --> 00:38:52,186
You okay?

701
00:38:52,221 --> 00:38:56,001
- I don't have my cuffs.
- Here.

702
00:38:57,574 --> 00:39:01,648
- Give me your hands.
- Mr. Monk, it's okay, it's okay.

703
00:39:02,034 --> 00:39:03,512
It's all over.

704
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:06,712
It's all over.

705
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:28,197
"I don't need a gun
to make me feel strong"

706
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:31,883
"I don't need a captain
shoot me down all day long"

707
00:39:31,918 --> 00:39:35,558
"I don't need your moustache
don't you condescend to me"

708
00:39:35,593 --> 00:39:41,651
"I don't need nobody
'cause baby I am free"

709
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:48,937
"no I don't need nobody
baby I am free"

710
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:06,294
Wow, that had some good energy.

711
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:09,251
Yeah, a lot of energy.

712
00:40:10,312 --> 00:40:12,821
Let's watch it again sometime.

713
00:40:12,856 --> 00:40:16,281
It doesn't matter.
I mean, the band broke up anyway.

714
00:40:16,316 --> 00:40:17,607
We couldn't agree on anything.

715
00:40:17,642 --> 00:40:20,205
Name, what kind of music to play.

716
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,575
Or whether or not I should shut up.

717
00:40:26,193 --> 00:40:28,250
Come here.

718
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:37,247
I believe this is yours.

719
00:40:39,051 --> 00:40:41,120
Welcome back, Randy.

720
00:40:41,155 --> 00:40:42,621
Welcome back.

721
00:40:42,656 --> 00:40:44,465
Are you okay?

722
00:40:44,755 --> 00:40:48,272
- Loose tooth.
- Huh?

723
00:40:48,307 --> 00:40:50,422
I betcha that happened
when they knocked him out.

724
00:40:50,457 --> 00:40:52,695
Oh, gosh, you gotta see a dentist.

725
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,275
Nah.

726
00:40:55,601 --> 00:40:58,013
Mr. Monk, there's nothing to be afraid of.

727
00:40:58,048 --> 00:41:00,174
What, I'll be with you the whole time.

728
00:41:00,209 --> 00:41:02,462
What are the odds of
another dentist torturing you?

729
00:41:02,497 --> 00:41:04,529
Let's not talk about it anymore.
