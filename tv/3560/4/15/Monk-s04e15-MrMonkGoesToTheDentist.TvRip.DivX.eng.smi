We're ahead of schedule.<br>
That's a first, huh?
<SYNC Start=5123><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5364><P Class=ENCC>
You wanna grab some coffee?
<SYNC Start=7199><P Class=ENCC>
No, I gotta get home.
<SYNC Start=9328><P Class=ENCC>
We're meeting the wedding planner.
<SYNC Start=11739><P Class=ENCC>
- I thought that was last night.<br>
- No, last night was the caterer.
<SYNC Start=15031><P Class=ENCC>
Should have taken my advice.<br>
Should have just eloped.
<SYNC Start=18060><P Class=ENCC>
- Yeah, well, it's too late now.<br>
- Now, it's not, man. You can do it.
<SYNC Start=21381><P Class=ENCC>
Hop on a plane tonight,<br>
go to Vegas.
<SYNC Start=23185><P Class=ENCC>
Boom, it's all over.
<SYNC Start=25278><P Class=ENCC>
Rachel's mom would<br>
never speak to me again.
<SYNC Start=29161><P Class=ENCC>
That's the best argument to do it.
<SYNC Start=30834><P Class=ENCC>
I've been trying to get my mother-in-law<br>
to shut up for five years.
<SYNC Start=33985><P Class=ENCC>
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's this?
<SYNC Start=35442><P Class=ENCC>
What the hell are they doing?
<SYNC Start=37368><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=41582><P Class=ENCC>
- Hit the brakes!<br>
- I'm trying.
<SYNC Start=43331><P Class=ENCC>
Try the emergency brake!
<SYNC Start=44759><P Class=ENCC>
This is Baker 4.<br>
We're on Vinton and Hillside.
<SYNC Start=47348><P Class=ENCC>
It's a hijacking.<br>
I repeat, we are being hijacked.
<SYNC Start=50965><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=51641><P Class=ENCC>
They're jamming us.

<SYNC Start=122706><P Class=ENCC>
We just found the truck.<br>
This been sitting here for three days.
<SYNC Start=125533><P Class=ENCC>
Thanks. And they left most<br>
of the cash.
<SYNC Start=128004><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, sir.
<SYNC Start=129512><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=130025><P Class=ENCC>
And these are the drivers.
<SYNC Start=132056><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, the ME said they<br>
put up a fight. I mean... 
<SYNC Start=134862><P Class=ENCC>
blood everywhere<br>
like there was a struggle.
<SYNC Start=137323><P Class=ENCC>
Well, good for them.
<SYNC Start=138547><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe they injured one of the bastards.<br>
Let's check the hospitals.
<SYNC Start=141529><P Class=ENCC>
I want a list of all gunshot wounds, <br>
knife wounds. / Yes, sir.
<SYNC Start=145725><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=145896><P Class=ENCC>
- You okay?<br>
- Oh, toothache.
<SYNC Start=148983><P Class=ENCC>
Wait, is that the same tooth?<br>
I told you to take care of that.
<SYNC Start=151965><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, I am.<br>
I'm chewing on the other side.
<SYNC Start=155541><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=155794><P Class=ENCC>
It's fine, I hardly notice it.
<SYNC Start=158437><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=159323><P Class=ENCC>
You're crying.
<SYNC Start=161220><P Class=ENCC>
Randy, you're no good to me like this.<br>
Go to a dentist.
<SYNC Start=163592><P Class=ENCC>
- I have an appointment Saturday.<br>
- Oh, I get it.
<SYNC Start=167018><P Class=ENCC>
You don't wanna use up<br>
your sick days.
<SYNC Start=168690><P Class=ENCC>
You're saving your sick days for when<br>
you're not feeling sick, is that it?
<SYNC Start=173615><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=174870><P Class=ENCC>
I'm gonna go talk to Monk.<br>
You make me wanna talk to Monk.
<SYNC Start=178696><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=188823><P Class=ENCC>
God, I just heard one of those guys<br>
was about to get married.
<SYNC Start=192757><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=193144><P Class=ENCC>
Randy?
<SYNC Start=194703><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=196100><P Class=ENCC>
I know, I know, it's heartbreaking.<br>
They were so young.
<SYNC Start=200319><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=200927><P Class=ENCC>
Sweetie, it's okay to cry.<br>
It means you have a heart.
<SYNC Start=206111><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=206535><P Class=ENCC>
Here, look at me.
<SYNC Start=208324><P Class=ENCC>
You're a compassionate person.<br>
That's nothing to be ashamed of.
<SYNC Start=211970><P Class=ENCC>
- It hurts.<br>
- I know. I know it hurts.
<SYNC Start=216131><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=221089><P Class=ENCC>
You don't want anybody to see you?
<SYNC Start=223270><P Class=ENCC>
I understand.
<SYNC Start=224998><P Class=ENCC>
You know what? If anyone says anything,<br>
we'll just say that you, uh... / My tooth, oh...
<SYNC Start=228968><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, perfect, that you<br>
have a toothache. / Oh, god.
<SYNC Start=232480><P Class=ENCC>
- God, this hurts.<br>
- Okay, I think that's overdoing it.
<SYNC Start=235543><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, please, Jesus,<br>
somebody just shoot me.
<SYNC Start=237580><P Class=ENCC>
Randy, no one's gonna believe that.
<SYNC Start=239780><P Class=ENCC>
There's some oil on the floor.
<SYNC Start=242676><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=243114><P Class=ENCC>
Is that a clue?<br>
Is that important?
<SYNC Start=244689><P Class=ENCC>
Nah, there's oil on the floor.
<SYNC Start=247888><P Class=ENCC>
I'll call the EPA.
<SYNC Start=250124><P Class=ENCC>
So, do you, uh...
<SYNC Start=251849><P Class=ENCC>
any ideas about the robbery?
<SYNC Start=254532><P Class=ENCC>
Did you notice the back bumper,<br>
how damaged it was? / Yeah.
<SYNC Start=257273><P Class=ENCC>
And these side mirrors are pushed in.
<SYNC Start=260326><P Class=ENCC>
I don't think this<br>
armored car was driven here.
<SYNC Start=264658><P Class=ENCC>
- It wasn't?<br>
- No.
<SYNC Start=266451><P Class=ENCC>
I think it was carried somehow<br>
in the back of a bigger truck.
<SYNC Start=272819><P Class=ENCC>
You see the tire tracks<br>
from a larger vehicle.
<SYNC Start=275972><P Class=ENCC>
You're right.
<SYNC Start=277414><P Class=ENCC>
It was probably an 18-wheeler<br>
about 14 feet wide.
<SYNC Start=282541><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=282704><P Class=ENCC>
So they brought the armored car here,<br>
they unload it.
<SYNC Start=287068><P Class=ENCC>
How did they get the drivers<br>
out of the cab?
<SYNC Start=291556><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=294991><P Class=ENCC>
With this.
<SYNC Start=296384><P Class=ENCC>
A piece of rubber tubing.
<SYNC Start=299470><P Class=ENCC>
They drilled the hole here.
<SYNC Start=302265><P Class=ENCC>
In the plexiglas.
<SYNC Start=304613><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=305081><P Class=ENCC>
They gassed them out.
<SYNC Start=307417><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=308844><P Class=ENCC>
Randy?
<SYNC Start=310365><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, sir?
<SYNC Start=311938><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=312141><P Class=ENCC>
Bag this up.
<SYNC Start=314072><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=314701><P Class=ENCC>
He has a toothache. / Yeah, I know.<br>
He's been bitching about it all week.
<SYNC Start=319241><P Class=ENCC>
- What, it's a real toothache?<br>
- Yeah.
<SYNC Start=322010><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=322485><P Class=ENCC>
I can't believe you lied to me like that.<br>
Why didn't you just say I have a toothache?
<SYNC Start=325911><P Class=ENCC>
I did, like ten times.
<SYNC Start=327566><P Class=ENCC>
Randy, if you don't take care<br>
of this tooth immediately today,
<SYNC Start=331683><P Class=ENCC>
I'm gonna rip it out myself, understand?
<SYNC Start=334419><P Class=ENCC>
Fine.
<SYNC Start=336189><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=337927><P Class=ENCC>
What?
<SYNC Start=339585><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=346945><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Disher?
<SYNC Start=348940><P Class=ENCC>
- Yeah.<br>
- Oh, good. I'm Terri.
<SYNC Start=352455><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=352712><P Class=ENCC>
Did you do all your paperwork?
<SYNC Start=354543><P Class=ENCC>
Both sides.<br>
Good boy. / Yeah.
<SYNC Start=358282><P Class=ENCC>
Where's your receptionist?
<SYNC Start=360633><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, our nighttime receptionist quit.
<SYNC Start=363058><P Class=ENCC>
- Couldn't stand the excitement, huh?<br>
- I guess not.
<SYNC Start=366126><P Class=ENCC>
So you're gonna be in room B.
<SYNC Start=368152><P Class=ENCC>
That's between A and C.
<SYNC Start=370547><P Class=ENCC>
Well, what if I get lost?
<SYNC Start=372558><P Class=ENCC>
You want me to draw you a map?
<SYNC Start=375115><P Class=ENCC>
- Yeah, I think I can find it.<br>
- Okay. I'll be right in.
<SYNC Start=379457><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=385762><P Class=ENCC>
Well, Mr. Disher, I'm Oliver Bloom.
<SYNC Start=388702><P Class=ENCC>
Don't get up. Just kidding.
<SYNC Start=390201><P Class=ENCC>
- You're a lieutenant, am I right?<br>
- Yeah.
<SYNC Start=392155><P Class=ENCC>
I can usually guess within one rank.
<SYNC Start=393953><P Class=ENCC>
I see a lot of cops in here.<br>
We're on the medical plan, you know.
<SYNC Start=396226><P Class=ENCC>
Thanks for seeing me<br>
on such short notice.
<SYNC Start=398490><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, that's not a problem.
<SYNC Start=400803><P Class=ENCC>
We're open late on Tuesdays and Thursdays<br>
in case of emergencies.
<SYNC Start=403654><P Class=ENCC>
Also to keep Terri here off the streets.
<SYNC Start=406531><P Class=ENCC>
- He worries about me.<br>
- I do.
<SYNC Start=408625><P Class=ENCC>
You know what I'm really worried about?<br>
I worry about this bad boy right here.
<SYNC Start=413091><P Class=ENCC>
Your number three molar.
<SYNC Start=415057><P Class=ENCC>
Terri, can I have a light, please?
<SYNC Start=417209><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=417717><P Class=ENCC>
I want you to open wide,<br>
just try to relax.
<SYNC Start=421750><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=422915><P Class=ENCC>
A little wider.<br>
Okay, just relax.
<SYNC Start=425951><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=426547><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, okay.<br>
A little sensitive.
<SYNC Start=428807><P Class=ENCC>
Well, I hope you're not in love<br>
with that tooth, lieutenant,
<SYNC Start=431164><P Class=ENCC>
because I'm afraid it's gonna have to go.
<SYNC Start=433320><P Class=ENCC>
Now, we can either pull it next week,<br>
or we can do it today.
<SYNC Start=436535><P Class=ENCC>
The choice is yours.
<SYNC Start=438213><P Class=ENCC>
Let's do it now.
<SYNC Start=439920><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, Randy, we're gonna<br>
put you under for about 30 minutes.
<SYNC Start=443205><P Class=ENCC>
You're not gonna feel a thing.
<SYNC Start=445854><P Class=ENCC>
As a matter of fact, you're gonna<br>
be back here every week for this.
<SYNC Start=449154><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=449581><P Class=ENCC>
And if you're a really good boy,<br>
I'm gonna give you a sticker afterwards.
<SYNC Start=452614><P Class=ENCC>
What if I'm a bad boy?
<SYNC Start=455610><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=456821><P Class=ENCC>
Just breathe.
<SYNC Start=458485><P Class=ENCC>
Breathe normally, relax.
<SYNC Start=460062><P Class=ENCC>
I know it's hard with Terri<br>
standing over you.
<SYNC Start=462991><P Class=ENCC>
Can you hear me?
<SYNC Start=465327><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=465500><P Class=ENCC>
Just relax, I want you<br>
to take ten deep breaths, okay?
<SYNC Start=469058><P Class=ENCC>
One,
<SYNC Start=470681><P Class=ENCC>
two,
<SYNC Start=472532><P Class=ENCC>
three,
<SYNC Start=474890><P Class=ENCC>
four, 
<SYNC Start=477084><P Class=ENCC>
five...
<SYNC Start=479417><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=482253><P Class=ENCC>
Terri, I'm gonna need that angled<br>
director probe again please.
<SYNC Start=486059><P Class=ENCC>
Angled director probe.
<SYNC Start=488376><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=491009><P Class=ENCC>
Doctor, wait, I think<br>
he's coming awake again.
<SYNC Start=494448><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=502115><P Class=ENCC>
Come on.
<SYNC Start=503771><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=505347><P Class=ENCC>
Hey!
<SYNC Start=506706><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=507288><P Class=ENCC>
- What are you doing here?<br>
- What did you do with Barry Bonds?
<SYNC Start=509954><P Class=ENCC>
I know he's here somewhere.
<SYNC Start=511780><P Class=ENCC>
What did you do?<br>
I know he's here.
<SYNC Start=513740><P Class=ENCC>
- I know he's here.<br>
- What are you talking about?
<SYNC Start=515545><P Class=ENCC>
- Barry Bonds.<br>
- We don't know any Barry Bonds.
<SYNC Start=519008><P Class=ENCC>
He is worth $13 million.<br>
What did you do with him?
<SYNC Start=521390><P Class=ENCC>
- We're with a patient here.<br>
- Yeah, we have a patient here.
<SYNC Start=523689><P Class=ENCC>
- We're really...<br>
- Listen, Barry Bonds.
<SYNC Start=526411><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=528015><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, hey.
<SYNC Start=529477><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=531317><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, cut it out.
<SYNC Start=533719><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=534355><P Class=ENCC>
I'm a police officer.
<SYNC Start=536986><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=539098><P Class=ENCC>
I'm a police officer.
<SYNC Start=542028><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=542955><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, sleeping beauty.
<SYNC Start=546025><P Class=ENCC>
Welcome back.
<SYNC Start=548431><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=550100><P Class=ENCC>
Are you all right?
<SYNC Start=551534><P Class=ENCC>
Am I all right?<br>
Why wouldn't I be?
<SYNC Start=554424><P Class=ENCC>
There was a man in here.
<SYNC Start=556075><P Class=ENCC>
She has a man in here all the time.
<SYNC Start=559089><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=560148><P Class=ENCC>
You...
<SYNC Start=562234><P Class=ENCC>
you were fighting.
<SYNC Start=563840><P Class=ENCC>
Well, there was a fight, all right.
<SYNC Start=565404><P Class=ENCC>
Between me and this molar here.<br>
It didn't wanna come out.
<SYNC Start=568830><P Class=ENCC>
There's gonna be some<br>
sensitivity for a few days.
<SYNC Start=570853><P Class=ENCC>
I wrote you a prescription.<br>
This should help with the pain.
<SYNC Start=573258><P Class=ENCC>
Now, don't take more<br>
than one every four hours.
<SYNC Start=576250><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, and I almost forgot.
<SYNC Start=578473><P Class=ENCC>
Your sticker.
<SYNC Start=580716><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=591000><P Class=ENCC>
Captain, there are no reports<br>
of any stolen trucks.
<SYNC Start=593698><P Class=ENCC>
Well, keep looking.<br>
Widen the net.
<SYNC Start=595367><P Class=ENCC>
Start at Seattle and<br>
work your way south.
<SYNC Start=597284><P Class=ENCC>
Captain, here's a copy<br>
of the updated manifest.
<SYNC Start=599726><P Class=ENCC>
The cash was new, right? / Yes, sir,<br>
it would have been easily traced.
<SYNC Start=603182><P Class=ENCC>
All they took were the negotiable<br>
bank certificates over $10 million.
<SYNC Start=606178><P Class=ENCC>
All right, let's follow the money.
<SYNC Start=607784><P Class=ENCC>
How many fences in the country<br>
could handle a haul like this?
<SYNC Start=610419><P Class=ENCC>
- I'll find out.<br>
- Captain?
<SYNC Start=611946><P Class=ENCC>
Randy, welcome back.
<SYNC Start=613663><P Class=ENCC>
You're working with Patterson<br>
on the bank certificates.
<SYNC Start=615985><P Class=ENCC>
Get me Frank Davis<br>
at the treasury department on the line.
<SYNC Start=618590><P Class=ENCC>
And put a list together of all the fences.<br>
Any fence in the country who's got the balls...
<SYNC Start=621166><P Class=ENCC>
- Captain, do you have a minute?<br>
- Yeah, what's up?
<SYNC Start=624773><P Class=ENCC>
- It's about my dentist, Dr. Bloom?<br>
- Yeah?
<SYNC Start=629279><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=629857><P Class=ENCC>
I think, um...
<SYNC Start=631857><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=633330><P Class=ENCC>
- I think he might...<br>
- Did he touch you inappropriately?
<SYNC Start=638142><P Class=ENCC>
What? No, Jesus, no. No.
<SYNC Start=641273><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=642038><P Class=ENCC>
I think he killed a guy.
<SYNC Start=644348><P Class=ENCC>
- He what?<br>
- It happened.
<SYNC Start=647147><P Class=ENCC>
I think that he, Dr. Bloom<br>
and his assistant Terri?
<SYNC Start=650043><P Class=ENCC>
I mean, I think they murdered someone.
<SYNC Start=653119><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=653429><P Class=ENCC>
- You saw it?<br>
- Yeah, sort of.
<SYNC Start=655213><P Class=ENCC>
I was sedated.
<SYNC Start=657604><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=658185><P Class=ENCC>
You were sedated?
<SYNC Start=660448><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=660717><P Class=ENCC>
Randy, one time, I was under anesthesia.<br>
I thought my moustache was a chipmunk.
<SYNC Start=664400><P Class=ENCC>
I was the Green Lantern once.
<SYNC Start=667238><P Class=ENCC>
It was great.<br>
I didn't wanna wake up.
<SYNC Start=670253><P Class=ENCC>
Look, I was supposed<br>
to be out for 30 minutes.
<SYNC Start=673295><P Class=ENCC>
But I was under for almost two hours.
<SYNC Start=675185><P Class=ENCC>
- Was there a body?<br>
- No.
<SYNC Start=676958><P Class=ENCC>
- Any signs of struggle?<br>
- No.
<SYNC Start=678573><P Class=ENCC>
- And who did they kill?<br>
- I don't know.
<SYNC Start=680675><P Class=ENCC>
It was a guy.<br>
Male, caucasian, 5'11", 200 pounds.
<SYNC Start=684862><P Class=ENCC>
They were arguing about Barry Bonds.<br>
And I'm pretty sure that I can ID him.
<SYNC Start=688119><P Class=ENCC>
- The baseball player?<br>
- Yeah.
<SYNC Start=690841><P Class=ENCC>
I think this guy thought<br>
Dr. Bloom kidnapped Barry Bonds.
<SYNC Start=694435><P Class=ENCC>
I mean, they were arguing about<br>
how much Barry Bonds was worth.
<SYNC Start=697229><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, you know, if your dentist played baseball,<br>
you know what team he'd play for?
<SYNC Start=701477><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=701900><P Class=ENCC>
The Yanks. Get it?
<SYNC Start=706018><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=706166><P Class=ENCC>
It's not funny.
<SYNC Start=707985><P Class=ENCC>
It's a little funny, Randy.
<SYNC Start=710837><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=711146><P Class=ENCC>
Look, why don't you, um...
<SYNC Start=713544><P Class=ENCC>
take a walk.<br>
Clear you head.
<SYNC Start=716381><P Class=ENCC>
Here, drop this off at Monk's.<br>
He's waiting for this.
<SYNC Start=719249><P Class=ENCC>
Then take the rest of the day off, okay?<br>
Go to the movies, go to the beach.
<SYNC Start=723027><P Class=ENCC>
Okay? Get out of here.
<SYNC Start=725458><P Class=ENCC>
I'll call you later.
<SYNC Start=727152><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=729620><P Class=ENCC>
Is this everything? The whole file?
<SYNC Start=731786><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah.
<SYNC Start=733320><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=735149><P Class=ENCC>
Monk, can I ask you a question?
<SYNC Start=737297><P Class=ENCC>
What do you normally charge?
<SYNC Start=739346><P Class=ENCC>
You know, for someone<br>
who wants to hire you.
<SYNC Start=742449><P Class=ENCC>
I mean, not the department.<br>
A private party.
<SYNC Start=745561><P Class=ENCC>
Like who?
<SYNC Start=747475><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=747674><P Class=ENCC>
Like me.
<SYNC Start=749029><P Class=ENCC>
Is this about the dentist?
<SYNC Start=750647><P Class=ENCC>
The captain called us. He said you<br>
had a reaction to the anesthesia.
<SYNC Start=754867><P Class=ENCC>
- You were probably hallucinating...<br>
- No, I wasn't hallucinating.
<SYNC Start=758633><P Class=ENCC>
It really happened.
<SYNC Start=760616><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=761060><P Class=ENCC>
It was as real as you are right now<br>
standing in front of me.
<SYNC Start=764252><P Class=ENCC>
Randy, I'm not standing.
<SYNC Start=768633><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=772131><P Class=ENCC>
But if you need my help...<br>
you don't have to pay me.
<SYNC Start=775865><P Class=ENCC>
All you have to do is ask.
<SYNC Start=777848><P Class=ENCC>
I mean, you're one of my oldest friends.<br>
I've known you for years.
<SYNC Start=783583><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=783871><P Class=ENCC>
Thank you. I want you to come back<br>
to the dentist's office with me.
<SYNC Start=786864><P Class=ENCC>
Let me finish.
<SYNC Start=789124><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=789308><P Class=ENCC>
Unfortunately, at the moment,<br>
I have a lot of things on my plate.
<SYNC Start=793247><P Class=ENCC>
No, you don't.
<SYNC Start=795067><P Class=ENCC>
Well, I have this armored car thing.
<SYNC Start=798416><P Class=ENCC>
I have to read this whole file<br>
that's about 120 pages.
<SYNC Start=801060><P Class=ENCC>
And I just found a typo, by the way.
<SYNC Start=803568><P Class=ENCC>
And I have to replace<br>
the lint filter on my dryer.
<SYNC Start=807095><P Class=ENCC>
Filters do not replace themselves.
<SYNC Start=808614><P Class=ENCC>
- Mr. Monk, can I talk to you for a minute?<br>
- I have to talk to Natalie for a minute.
<SYNC Start=811552><P Class=ENCC>
- Privately?<br>
- What?
<SYNC Start=813169><P Class=ENCC>
In the kitchen?
<SYNC Start=814788><P Class=ENCC>
- Now.<br>
- Okay. / Go.
<SYNC Start=817792><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=822329><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Monk, this is Randy we're talking about.<br>
He would do anything for you.
<SYNC Start=825282><P Class=ENCC>
And I would do anything for him<br>
except this, Natalie. I can't do it.
<SYNC Start=828280><P Class=ENCC>
I have a thing about dentists.
<SYNC Start=829978><P Class=ENCC>
- You have a thing about everything.<br>
- That's true, 
<SYNC Start=832149><P Class=ENCC>
but dentists are in a separate<br>
category altogether, okay?
<SYNC Start=835881><P Class=ENCC>
I can't even discuss it.<br>
I can't even think about discussing it.
<SYNC Start=839393><P Class=ENCC>
I can't even talk about<br>
thinking about discussing it.
<SYNC Start=841388><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Monk, everybody's afraid of dentists.
<SYNC Start=843339><P Class=ENCC>
Not like this.<br>
Not like this.
<SYNC Start=845140><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, okay, okay.<br>
How afraid are you?
<SYNC Start=846730><P Class=ENCC>
On a scale of 1 to 10.
<SYNC Start=848407><P Class=ENCC>
10. I am so far beyond 10,<br>
I laugh at your 10s.
<SYNC Start=851678><P Class=ENCC>
I lie awake at night dreaming about 10s.
<SYNC Start=854660><P Class=ENCC>
The chair and the probing and<br>
the drilling and the rinsing.
<SYNC Start=857539><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, Mr. Monk, what do you do<br>
when you get a cavity?
<SYNC Start=859448><P Class=ENCC>
I don't get a cavity.<br>
I don't get cavities.
<SYNC Start=861704><P Class=ENCC>
I brush my teeth 12 times a day<br>
and I floss every 90 minutes.
<SYNC Start=864611><P Class=ENCC>
- So you've never been to a dentist.<br>
- Once, when I was 12.
<SYNC Start=867806><P Class=ENCC>
How'd that go?
<SYNC Start=869318><P Class=ENCC>
Not well.
<SYNC Start=871099><P Class=ENCC>
You know, this is ridiculous.<br>
We're just gonna go there and look around.
<SYNC Start=873978><P Class=ENCC>
You're not a patient.<br>
You're not sitting in the chair.
<SYNC Start=876602><P Class=ENCC>
There's no probing.<br>
There's no drilling.
<SYNC Start=878480><P Class=ENCC>
I'll be with you the whole time.
<SYNC Start=880898><P Class=ENCC>
But I... / No.
<SYNC Start=883156><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=887429><P Class=ENCC>
He's happy to do it.
<SYNC Start=889547><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=889944><P Class=ENCC>
Great.
<SYNC Start=891406><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=900187><P Class=ENCC>
I don't see anything.
<SYNC Start=902326><P Class=ENCC>
It happened in the other room.<br>
Room B.
<SYNC Start=905489><P Class=ENCC>
What do you think?
<SYNC Start=907668><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=907932><P Class=ENCC>
Psst, Mr. Monk.
<SYNC Start=910079><P Class=ENCC>
I'm pretty sure this is how the Nazis<br>
decorated their bunkers.
<SYNC Start=914833><P Class=ENCC>
Don't look at that.<br>
Look, look, look, look down.
<SYNC Start=917303><P Class=ENCC>
Look at the carpet.<br>
What a beautiful carpet.
<SYNC Start=919628><P Class=ENCC>
- It is a beautiful carpet.<br>
- Right? Is that better?
<SYNC Start=921824><P Class=ENCC>
That is better.
<SYNC Start=923737><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=924901><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, highlights for children.
<SYNC Start=927476><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, find the hidden picture.<br>
I used to love these.
<SYNC Start=929777><P Class=ENCC>
Where is the egg beater?
<SYNC Start=932496><P Class=ENCC>
It's under the sled.
<SYNC Start=935015><P Class=ENCC>
You're right.
<SYNC Start=936999><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=937353><P Class=ENCC>
And the umbrella is in the cloud<br>
above the snowman.
<SYNC Start=941222><P Class=ENCC>
And the fish is next to the ice skate.
<SYNC Start=943617><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, how are you doing that?
<SYNC Start=945216><P Class=ENCC>
I read that same issue 35 years ago.
<SYNC Start=949403><P Class=ENCC>
It was in the...
<SYNC Start=951551><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=952873><P Class=ENCC>
it was in...<br>
the dentist's office.
<SYNC Start=956636><P Class=ENCC>
Natalie, I can't do this.
<SYNC Start=958106><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no,<br>
you can do this.
<SYNC Start=959682><P Class=ENCC>
You can do this.<br>
You're doing great.
<SYNC Start=961831><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, here, here, here, sit down<br>
and think about something else, okay?
<SYNC Start=964855><P Class=ENCC>
Here, I brought the case file.
<SYNC Start=966912><P Class=ENCC>
Concentrate on this.
<SYNC Start=969260><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=971868><P Class=ENCC>
Lieutenant. You back for more?
<SYNC Start=974856><P Class=ENCC>
No, no.
<SYNC Start=976739><P Class=ENCC>
Actually, I think<br>
I just left my cell phone...
<SYNC Start=978772><P Class=ENCC>
in the chair in room B.
<SYNC Start=980548><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, well, it's empty now<br>
if you wanna take a look.
<SYNC Start=982935><P Class=ENCC>
Great.
<SYNC Start=984274><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=985343><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, I'm Natalie, I'm just gonna help him.<br>
He can't ever find anything.
<SYNC Start=988643><P Class=ENCC>
I'm gonna be right back.<br>
I'm gonna be right here. Are you okay?
<SYNC Start=991221><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
<SYNC Start=994729><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1004833><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, I was in the chair.
<SYNC Start=1008224><P Class=ENCC>
And they were fighting over there.
<SYNC Start=1012276><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1013264><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, well, I don't see anything.
<SYNC Start=1016847><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1019355><P Class=ENCC>
He bought new equipment.
<SYNC Start=1021885><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1023041><P Class=ENCC>
He bought new equipment to replace<br>
the stuff that got broken during the fight.
<SYNC Start=1027537><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1027720><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe.
<SYNC Start=1029710><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1039966><P Class=ENCC>
- What's that?<br>
- It's a drill.
<SYNC Start=1043098><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1043907><P Class=ENCC>
Don't be afraid.
<SYNC Start=1046111><P Class=ENCC>
I'm not afraid.
<SYNC Start=1048350><P Class=ENCC>
Don't be afraid.
<SYNC Start=1050723><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1051663><P Class=ENCC>
Don't be afraid.
<SYNC Start=1053936><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1062973><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Monk, it's okay.
<SYNC Start=1064372><P Class=ENCC>
We're gonna go home now.<br>
You can let go.
<SYNC Start=1066002><P Class=ENCC>
No, no, we're not going anywhere.<br>
He hasn't seen anything yet.
<SYNC Start=1068093><P Class=ENCC>
- I think he's seen enough.<br>
- Is there a problem?
<SYNC Start=1070915><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, no, no, I just left<br>
my cell phone in the other room.
<SYNC Start=1074668><P Class=ENCC>
Dr. Bloom, this is Adrian Monk.<br>
He's a friend of mine.
<SYNC Start=1077574><P Class=ENCC>
The Adrian Monk, the detective?<br>
It's a pleasure to meet you.
<SYNC Start=1081680><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1083778><P Class=ENCC>
Apparently, the pleasure's all mine.
<SYNC Start=1085505><P Class=ENCC>
No, he just has a little<br>
thing about dentists.
<SYNC Start=1087720><P Class=ENCC>
You know what?<br>
It happens to me all the time.
<SYNC Start=1089653><P Class=ENCC>
I don't take it personally.
<SYNC Start=1091459><P Class=ENCC>
Let me help you with that.
<SYNC Start=1093735><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1094638><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, are you working<br>
on the armored car case?
<SYNC Start=1096678><P Class=ENCC>
I've been reading about it.<br>
I'm a bit of a true crime aficionado.
<SYNC Start=1100081><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sorry, that's just classified.
<SYNC Start=1102171><P Class=ENCC>
Well, you got a couple of hobbies then, huh?<br>
True crime and baseball.
<SYNC Start=1106278><P Class=ENCC>
Baseball?
<SYNC Start=1107786><P Class=ENCC>
Well, yeah, I'm sure I heard you guys<br>
talking about Barry Bonds yesterday.
<SYNC Start=1113134><P Class=ENCC>
Well, you know what?<br>
People hear a lot of crazy things<br>
when they're under sedation.
<SYNC Start=1116602><P Class=ENCC>
They say a lot of crazy things too.<br>
I should write a book, really.
<SYNC Start=1119520><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, sir, I understand.
<SYNC Start=1121311><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, we're on our way.<br>
We gotta go, that was the captain.
<SYNC Start=1123591><P Class=ENCC>
- Oh, we gotta go.<br>
- Okay.
<SYNC Start=1126365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1126789><P Class=ENCC>
Take care.
<SYNC Start=1128648><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1134134><P Class=ENCC>
A couple of fishermen just found him.
<SYNC Start=1136598><P Class=ENCC>
These two bruises, ten inches apart.
<SYNC Start=1140309><P Class=ENCC>
There's another set of bruises<br>
exactly ten inches apart.
<SYNC Start=1144510><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, what caused that?
<SYNC Start=1146243><P Class=ENCC>
Well, it must be something<br>
ten inches apart. / Thanks a lot.
<SYNC Start=1150755><P Class=ENCC>
Well, what do you got?<br>
You said it was important.
<SYNC Start=1153164><P Class=ENCC>
I found this in his trousers.
<SYNC Start=1155715><P Class=ENCC>
It was in his pants cuff.<br>
It's plexiglas.
<SYNC Start=1160048><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1160251><P Class=ENCC>
- It's gotta be one of the hijackers.<br>
- He drilled the hole.
<SYNC Start=1163431><P Class=ENCC>
So who is he?
<SYNC Start=1165309><P Class=ENCC>
Turn him over.
<SYNC Start=1167403><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1169948><P Class=ENCC>
- I don't recognize him, do you?<br>
- No.
<SYNC Start=1172155><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, my god.
<SYNC Start=1173763><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1174878><P Class=ENCC>
That's the guy.<br>
That's the guy from the dentist's office.
<SYNC Start=1177278><P Class=ENCC>
Randy, I told you to<br>
take some time off. / No, no.
<SYNC Start=1180359><P Class=ENCC>
Captain, that's the guy.<br>
I told you I could ID him.
<SYNC Start=1183614><P Class=ENCC>
And that is definitely the guy.
<SYNC Start=1185397><P Class=ENCC>
What, this is the guy that your dentist killed<br>
along with his hygienist? / That's right.
<SYNC Start=1189358><P Class=ENCC>
This the guy that they killed in front of you<br>
while you were in the chair. / That's right.
<SYNC Start=1193284><P Class=ENCC>
All right, because Dr. Bloom<br>
kidnapped Barry Bonds,
<SYNC Start=1196229><P Class=ENCC>
and they were arguing<br>
about the ransom money, right?
<SYNC Start=1198017><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, what, is that so crazy?<br>
What the hell are you laughing at, Peterson?
<SYNC Start=1202566><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1202697><P Class=ENCC>
I'm not crazy. / Okay, nobody said <br>
you were crazy, Randy. 
<SYNC Start=1205017><P Class=ENCC>
Out loud. / While you were there you <br>
should've had them put some wisdom teeth in.
<SYNC Start=1208082><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, you can't even spell<br>
wisdom teeth, Downey.
<SYNC Start=1210147><P Class=ENCC>
- All right, look, Natalie.<br>
- What?
<SYNC Start=1211896><P Class=ENCC>
You and Monk were there, right?<br>
Did you notice anything?
<SYNC Start=1214915><P Class=ENCC>
No, I wasn't really on my game.<br>
I have this thing about dentists.
<SYNC Start=1220191><P Class=ENCC>
Kroger calls it a supermegaphobia.
<SYNC Start=1222836><P Class=ENCC>
If germs are here and snakes are here,<br>
the dentists are...
<SYNC Start=1226982><P Class=ENCC>
You see that branch up there?<br>
The second one from the top?
<SYNC Start=1229653><P Class=ENCC>
The one above that one.
<SYNC Start=1231164><P Class=ENCC>
Captain, are you going to<br>
investigate this or not?
<SYNC Start=1235302><P Class=ENCC>
Randy, you were sedated.<br>
You couldn't have seen anything.
<SYNC Start=1240651><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1243082><P Class=ENCC>
Fine, I quit.
<SYNC Start=1245371><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1245645><P Class=ENCC>
- You what?<br>
- No, I quit.
<SYNC Start=1247353><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sick and tired of being treated<br>
like the village idiot.
<SYNC Start=1250686><P Class=ENCC>
- Here's my gun and my badge.<br>
- Randy, come on.
<SYNC Start=1252399><P Class=ENCC>
I'm not a joke.
<SYNC Start=1253958><P Class=ENCC>
I'm not here to entertain you.
<SYNC Start=1256060><P Class=ENCC>
I'm a homicide detective.
<SYNC Start=1257926><P Class=ENCC>
Randy, don't be ridiculous.
<SYNC Start=1260149><P Class=ENCC>
Take it.
<SYNC Start=1262505><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1264955><P Class=ENCC>
Randy.
<SYNC Start=1267150><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1270192><P Class=ENCC>
Randy.
<SYNC Start=1271954><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1275208><P Class=ENCC>
Captain, they just ID'ed the body.
<SYNC Start=1277533><P Class=ENCC>
Are you ready for this?
<SYNC Start=1279036><P Class=ENCC>
It's Denny Jardeen.
<SYNC Start=1280491><P Class=ENCC>
- Ooh, I know that name.<br>
- Yeah, he's an ex-cop.
<SYNC Start=1283300><P Class=ENCC>
Worked the Mission District.<br>
He was bad news.
<SYNC Start=1287198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1287537><P Class=ENCC>
He was charged five times.<br>
Excessive force, conduct unbecoming.
<SYNC Start=1292087><P Class=ENCC>
Took an early retirement four years ago.
<SYNC Start=1295181><P Class=ENCC>
Thanks.
<SYNC Start=1296944><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1299521><P Class=ENCC>
- What's he doing?<br>
- Flossing.
<SYNC Start=1301899><P Class=ENCC>
He's determined never to<br>
go back to a dentist again.
<SYNC Start=1304680><P Class=ENCC>
- Uh, just pretend I'm not here.<br>
- Monk, cut it out, I mean it.
<SYNC Start=1307897><P Class=ENCC>
This is a floss-free zone.
<SYNC Start=1310599><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1310793><P Class=ENCC>
- Since when?<br>
- Since right now. 
<SYNC Start=1313030><P Class=ENCC>
Cut it out.
<SYNC Start=1315043><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1317902><P Class=ENCC>
- What's this?<br>
- That's nothing.
<SYNC Start=1320401><P Class=ENCC>
Background check Oliver Bloom.<br>
You're checking out the dentist?
<SYNC Start=1324195><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, I figured it couldn't hurt<br>
to check him out.
<SYNC Start=1326751><P Class=ENCC>
You're doing this for Randy, aren't you?
<SYNC Start=1328821><P Class=ENCC>
Why don't you just call him?
<SYNC Start=1330489><P Class=ENCC>
Because he quit.
<SYNC Start=1332681><P Class=ENCC>
Randy is an adult.
<SYNC Start=1334603><P Class=ENCC>
He made a decision and I respect it.
<SYNC Start=1337359><P Class=ENCC>
You miss him, I can tell.
<SYNC Start=1339144><P Class=ENCC>
Look, Natalie, it's not like<br>
we were going steady, okay?
<SYNC Start=1342010><P Class=ENCC>
We worked together.<br>
He was just another cop.
<SYNC Start=1344460><P Class=ENCC>
That is not true.
<SYNC Start=1346503><P Class=ENCC>
You're right, it's not true.<br>
He's not just another cop,
<SYNC Start=1349198><P Class=ENCC>
he was the single most annoying<br>
human being to ever wear a badge.
<SYNC Start=1353500><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1358351><P Class=ENCC>
Present company excepted.
<SYNC Start=1360896><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, you guys, <br>
let's try this new one.
<SYNC Start=1364183><P Class=ENCC>
I printed up some lyric sheets.
<SYNC Start=1366677><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1366882><P Class=ENCC>
Why do we need lyric sheets?<br>
You're the only one singing.
<SYNC Start=1369675><P Class=ENCC>
Just so you can follow along.<br>
So you know what it's about.
<SYNC Start=1373732><P Class=ENCC>
- We're making a statement.<br>
- We are?
<SYNC Start=1376955><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1378501><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, let's do it, from the top.
<SYNC Start=1381137><P Class=ENCC>
A five, six, seven, eight.<br>
5, 6, 7, 8
<SYNC Start=1382732><P Class=ENCC>
Whoa, whoa, whoa!<br>
What was that?
<SYNC Start=1385788><P Class=ENCC>
- Counting off.<br>
- Five, six, seven, eight?<br>
- 5, 6, 7, 8?
<SYNC Start=1388566><P Class=ENCC>
- That's for dancing.<br>
- No, it's not.
<SYNC Start=1391036><P Class=ENCC>
You're supposed to go,<br>
"one, two, three, four."
<SYNC Start=1394132><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, what's the difference?
<SYNC Start=1395738><P Class=ENCC>
It's rock 'n roll, man.
<SYNC Start=1397440><P Class=ENCC>
Let's do that blues song<br>
we used to do.
<SYNC Start=1400340><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1400734><P Class=ENCC>
Guys.<br>
Guys, guys, guys!
<SYNC Start=1402516><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, guys, guys, why don't we just<br>
stick to the original material, okay?
<SYNC Start=1406123><P Class=ENCC>
I mean, that's what the people wanna hear.
<SYNC Start=1407847><P Class=ENCC>
What people? Randy,<br>
we're in my stepfather's garage.
<SYNC Start=1411201><P Class=ENCC>
Well, Aaron, there might<br>
be people one day.
<SYNC Start=1414640><P Class=ENCC>
I mean, touring, record deal?
<SYNC Start=1416579><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, guys, wasn't that the dream?
<SYNC Start=1418704><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe 17 years ago in 12th grade?
<SYNC Start=1423068><P Class=ENCC>
Well, you know what?
<SYNC Start=1424994><P Class=ENCC>
I still believe in the dream.
<SYNC Start=1426901><P Class=ENCC>
I mean, I believe in<br>
the Randy Disher project.
<SYNC Start=1429454><P Class=ENCC>
- Come on, I quit my job for this.<br>
- Big mistake.
<SYNC Start=1432748><P Class=ENCC>
All right, let's just do it, okay?
<SYNC Start=1435391><P Class=ENCC>
From the top.
<SYNC Start=1437172><P Class=ENCC>
If you say "five, six,<br>
seven, eight" again, I quit.
<SYNC Start=1440586><P Class=ENCC>
I'm just telling you.
<SYNC Start=1442033><P Class=ENCC>
That's good. You know what?<br>
Do you wanna be the lead singer?
<SYNC Start=1444005><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me.
<SYNC Start=1445424><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1447012><P Class=ENCC>
Can I talk to Mick Jagger for a second?
<SYNC Start=1450620><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, sure.
<SYNC Start=1452106><P Class=ENCC>
All right, guys, take a break, huh?
<SYNC Start=1454622><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1455000><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, it's a really good job<br>
so far, though. Really good.
<SYNC Start=1458483><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1461337><P Class=ENCC>
- How's it going?<br>
- It's good.
<SYNC Start=1463927><P Class=ENCC>
It's great. I mean, I should<br>
have done this years ago.
<SYNC Start=1465699><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, it's pretty exciting.
<SYNC Start=1467557><P Class=ENCC>
Um, you gotta send me a T-shirt<br>
or a hat or something.
<SYNC Start=1473618><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1474913><P Class=ENCC>
Or whatever.
<SYNC Start=1476402><P Class=ENCC>
Um, listen, I thought you might be interested.<br>
We caught a break on the armored car thing.
<SYNC Start=1481168><P Class=ENCC>
We identified the body.<br>
Guy's name is Denny Jardeen.
<SYNC Start=1483893><P Class=ENCC>
He's an ex-cop.
<SYNC Start=1485446><P Class=ENCC>
He's got a cousin who's done some time<br>
who works for a trucking company.
<SYNC Start=1489525><P Class=ENCC>
So we're gonna go pick him up.<br>
I thought you'd like to come along.
<SYNC Start=1493177><P Class=ENCC>
Why?
<SYNC Start=1494605><P Class=ENCC>
I mean, I'm not a cop anymore, Leland.
<SYNC Start=1496850><P Class=ENCC>
Captain.
<SYNC Start=1498747><P Class=ENCC>
Look at my notebook.
<SYNC Start=1500621><P Class=ENCC>
No more witness statements.<br>
Just lyrics and song ideas now.
<SYNC Start=1504554><P Class=ENCC>
- You're writing songs?<br>
- Yeah, I wrote 17 last night.
<SYNC Start=1508432><P Class=ENCC>
I'm on fire.
<SYNC Start=1510322><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sure you are.
<SYNC Start=1512522><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, I also wanted to apologize<br>
about the dentist.
<SYNC Start=1518927><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1519658><P Class=ENCC>
It's just that over the years<br>
you've had...
<SYNC Start=1523029><P Class=ENCC>
- so many unique theories.<br>
- I wasn't hallucinating.
<SYNC Start=1525538><P Class=ENCC>
Randy, I checked Dr. Bloom out<br>
myself on my own time.
<SYNC Start=1529533><P Class=ENCC>
The guy is clean.
<SYNC Start=1531366><P Class=ENCC>
He's got no priors.<br>
He's never been in trouble.
<SYNC Start=1535809><P Class=ENCC>
I just wanted you to know<br>
that I took you seriously.
<SYNC Start=1539991><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1541485><P Class=ENCC>
The fact is...
<SYNC Start=1544049><P Class=ENCC>
I miss you, I need you.
<SYNC Start=1547351><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1551632><P Class=ENCC>
Well, it's too late.
<SYNC Start=1553911><P Class=ENCC>
I've moved on.
<SYNC Start=1555494><P Class=ENCC>
I mean, the band's my life now.
<SYNC Start=1557589><P Class=ENCC>
You're more than welcome to come<br>
and have a listen if you want.
<SYNC Start=1560707><P Class=ENCC>
Come on in, be my guest.
<SYNC Start=1562681><P Class=ENCC>
Have a seat.
<SYNC Start=1564590><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1566001><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.<br>
How you doing?
<SYNC Start=1568462><P Class=ENCC>
Hey.
<SYNC Start=1569893><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1571253><P Class=ENCC>
I should warn you,<br>
you might not like what you hear.
<SYNC Start=1573792><P Class=ENCC>
It's pretty powerful stuff.<br>
You might not be able to handle it.
<SYNC Start=1577601><P Class=ENCC>
All right, let's rock it out.
<SYNC Start=1579641><P Class=ENCC>
From the top.
<SYNC Start=1581061><P Class=ENCC>
One, two, three, four.
<SYNC Start=1582973><P Class=ENCC>
Five, six, seven, eight.

All right, that was good.<br>
That wasn't too bad.
<SYNC Start=1630805><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1632678><P Class=ENCC>
That was great.
<SYNC Start=1634737><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1639795><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, now, before you even<br>
knock on the door,
<SYNC Start=1641843><P Class=ENCC>
I want you to douse this handkerchief<br>
with the chloroform.
<SYNC Start=1644397><P Class=ENCC>
Just like this, okay?
<SYNC Start=1646263><P Class=ENCC>
20 ccs, and make sure<br>
he really inhales it.
<SYNC Start=1650281><P Class=ENCC>
I don't know about this.
<SYNC Start=1652801><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1653035><P Class=ENCC>
Well, we have to do it,<br>
there's no choice.
<SYNC Start=1654788><P Class=ENCC>
No, no, I know.<br>
I mean, I don't know if 20 ccs is enough.
<SYNC Start=1658609><P Class=ENCC>
How do you know he's gonna talk?
<SYNC Start=1660643><P Class=ENCC>
Did you see him?
<SYNC Start=1662162><P Class=ENCC>
He couldn't even shake my hand.<br>
He was a mess. / Yeah.
<SYNC Start=1664448><P Class=ENCC>
You get Adrian Monk in here,
<SYNC Start=1666761><P Class=ENCC>
and I'll make him talk.
<SYNC Start=1669203><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1670134><P Class=ENCC>
Neal, your fingerprints were all over<br>
the warehouse and on the armored car.
<SYNC Start=1675305><P Class=ENCC>
You could hire the best lawyer in the city.<br>
It's not gonna make those<br>
fingerprints disappear.
<SYNC Start=1679050><P Class=ENCC>
It is all over and you know it.
<SYNC Start=1682728><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1685694><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, I was there.<br>
But I didn't do the two guards, man.
<SYNC Start=1691598><P Class=ENCC>
- I tried to stop him.<br>
- Stop who?
<SYNC Start=1694743><P Class=ENCC>
Denny. 
<SYNC Start=1696427><P Class=ENCC>
Denny Jardeen.
<SYNC Start=1699218><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1699479><P Class=ENCC>
One of the guards fought back and he<br>
went postal, man. And started shooting.
<SYNC Start=1702710><P Class=ENCC>
Where's the money, Neal?
<SYNC Start=1705141><P Class=ENCC>
Denny's got it.
<SYNC Start=1707084><P Class=ENCC>
He's keeping it in a shed back behind<br>
his place until we all split it up.
<SYNC Start=1710688><P Class=ENCC>
I got some bad news for you, Neal.<br>
Denny is dead.
<SYNC Start=1715413><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1715765><P Class=ENCC>
Denny? / And there's no money<br>
in that little tool shed.
<SYNC Start=1718351><P Class=ENCC>
We've already ripped it apart.
<SYNC Start=1720376><P Class=ENCC>
Now that's impossible.
<SYNC Start=1722187><P Class=ENCC>
Looks like somebody in your<br>
little sewing circle got greedy.
<SYNC Start=1726588><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1727026><P Class=ENCC>
You can't trust anybody<br>
these days, can you?
<SYNC Start=1731043><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1748807><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, Mr. Monk.
<SYNC Start=1751057><P Class=ENCC>
I know it's late.<br>
Can I come in?
<SYNC Start=1753331><P Class=ENCC>
Of course, of course.
<SYNC Start=1755254><P Class=ENCC>
Thank you.
<SYNC Start=1756788><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1759779><P Class=ENCC>
What, what is it?
<SYNC Start=1762254><P Class=ENCC>
Lieutenant Disher was right.
<SYNC Start=1764994><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1765388><P Class=ENCC>
Dr. Bloom killed a man two days ago.
<SYNC Start=1767622><P Class=ENCC>
And I don't even know who it was.
<SYNC Start=1769859><P Class=ENCC>
I mean, I'd never seen him<br>
before or anything.
<SYNC Start=1773351><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1775430><P Class=ENCC>
- I just don't know where else to go.<br>
- Yeah.
<SYNC Start=1779519><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1779992><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, are you gonna be crying a lot?
<SYNC Start=1782733><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe you wanna lean over the sink.
<SYNC Start=1784952><P Class=ENCC>
No, no, I'm fine.<br>
I'm sorry.
<SYNC Start=1786618><P Class=ENCC>
I'm just scared to death.
<SYNC Start=1788242><P Class=ENCC>
- Yeah, I'll call the captain, right?<br>
- No!
<SYNC Start=1790365><P Class=ENCC>
No, Dr. Bloom would kill me.<br>
You can't.
<SYNC Start=1792514><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, it's okay.
<SYNC Start=1794036><P Class=ENCC>
The police will protect you.
<SYNC Start=1796917><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, what is that?
<SYNC Start=1798675><P Class=ENCC>
- What, what?<br>
- I don't know.
<SYNC Start=1800291><P Class=ENCC>
- What is it?<br>
- I don't, it's right...
<SYNC Start=1802704><P Class=ENCC>
it's a something on your face.<br>
Like a smudge.
<SYNC Start=1806567><P Class=ENCC>
Smudge. / Yeah.
<SYNC Start=1808297><P Class=ENCC>
No. No, you're not getting it.<br>
It's right there.
<SYNC Start=1811328><P Class=ENCC>
- Did I get it?<br>
- No.
<SYNC Start=1813367><P Class=ENCC>
Here, I'll do it.<br>
Hold on. Okay.
<SYNC Start=1817181><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1818339><P Class=ENCC>
Did you get it?
<SYNC Start=1819979><P Class=ENCC>
- No?<br>
- No, it's right there.
<SYNC Start=1823831><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1826642><P Class=ENCC>
Chloroform.
<SYNC Start=1828305><P Class=ENCC>
You're drugging me.
<SYNC Start=1831136><P Class=ENCC>
Just relax.
<SYNC Start=1833381><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1833654><P Class=ENCC>
Did you get it?
<SYNC Start=1835552><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1840049><P Class=ENCC>
Did I get it?
<SYNC Start=1842085><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1845234><P Class=ENCC>
Did I get it?
<SYNC Start=1847655><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1850832><P Class=ENCC>
Did I get it.
<SYNC Start=1852987><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1858406><P Class=ENCC>
- Natalie!<br>
- Captain, is Mr. Monk here?
<SYNC Start=1860903><P Class=ENCC>
What would Monk be doing here?<br>
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
<SYNC Start=1863496><P Class=ENCC>
I called his house to read him<br>
tomorrow's weather report like I always do,<br>
but he didn't answer.
<SYNC Start=1867683><P Class=ENCC>
So I go over there, the door's open.<br>
The light's on, but he's not home.
<SYNC Start=1872802><P Class=ENCC>
The door was open?
<SYNC Start=1875348><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1906477><P Class=ENCC>
Thank you for waiting.<br>
The doctor will be right with you.
<SYNC Start=1909544><P Class=ENCC>
There's no rush.
<SYNC Start=1912536><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1920713><P Class=ENCC>
Why are you doing this?
<SYNC Start=1923027><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1924732><P Class=ENCC>
Why are you doing this?
<SYNC Start=1927158><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1927681><P Class=ENCC>
Please.
<SYNC Start=1929234><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1929519><P Class=ENCC>
Please.
<SYNC Start=1931200><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1933470><P Class=ENCC>
What are you gonna do?
<SYNC Start=1936000><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1937407><P Class=ENCC>
I didn't really have a smudge, did I?
<SYNC Start=1941752><P Class=ENCC>
You should be flattered.
<SYNC Start=1943232><P Class=ENCC>
The doctor doesn't usually<br>
come in this late.
<SYNC Start=1946439><P Class=ENCC>
Especially for new patients.
<SYNC Start=1949056><P Class=ENCC>
That tooth.
<SYNC Start=1951447><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1951749><P Class=ENCC>
The roots are about<br>
ten inches apart, aren't they?
<SYNC Start=1959379><P Class=ENCC>
If you say so.
<SYNC Start=1961394><P Class=ENCC>
I get it now.<br>
I know what happened.
<SYNC Start=1965188><P Class=ENCC>
The drivers fought back<br>
during the hijacking.
<SYNC Start=1969041><P Class=ENCC>
Denny Jardeen got hit in the face.
<SYNC Start=1972001><P Class=ENCC>
He must have knocked a tooth loose.
<SYNC Start=1974792><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1975329><P Class=ENCC>
So Jardeen came here to get<br>
his tooth fixed. Makes sense.
<SYNC Start=1980927><P Class=ENCC>
He's an ex-cop,<br>
and you're on the medical plan.
<SYNC Start=1985245><P Class=ENCC>
He must have talked in his sleep.
<SYNC Start=1988037><P Class=ENCC>
Dr. Bloom said a lot of patients do.<br>
He told you everything.
<SYNC Start=1991595><P Class=ENCC>
About the robbery,<br>
where they hid the money,
<SYNC Start=1995271><P Class=ENCC>
it must have been like<br>
winning the lottery.
<SYNC Start=1998272><P Class=ENCC>
If you say so.
<SYNC Start=2000278><P Class=ENCC>
That night, you went to Jardeen's house,<br>
found the money, figured it was safe.
<SYNC Start=2005279><P Class=ENCC>
That he'd never remember<br>
telling you anything.
<SYNC Start=2008803><P Class=ENCC>
But you were wrong.
<SYNC Start=2010533><P Class=ENCC>
He did remember.
<SYNC Start=2012920><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2013188><P Class=ENCC>
Or maybe, when the money went missing,
<SYNC Start=2017057><P Class=ENCC>
he just figured it out.
<SYNC Start=2019727><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2020991><P Class=ENCC>
He came back here Tuesday night<br>
while you were working on Randy.
<SYNC Start=2026163><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2030849><P Class=ENCC>
Randy witnessed the whole thing,<br>
sort of.
<SYNC Start=2032978><P Class=ENCC>
He was right about everything,<br>
wasn't he?
<SYNC Start=2038992><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2039961><P Class=ENCC>
If you say so.
<SYNC Start=2042029><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2042310><P Class=ENCC>
Hello, again, Mr. Monk.
<SYNC Start=2044870><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2047744><P Class=ENCC>
Is it true that you've only<br>
been to the dentist once before? / Yeah.
<SYNC Start=2051477><P Class=ENCC>
I gather it wasn't a good experience.
<SYNC Start=2054559><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2054865><P Class=ENCC>
Well, this'll be much worse.
<SYNC Start=2057069><P Class=ENCC>
I'm...
<SYNC Start=2058726><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2059174><P Class=ENCC>
I'm a police officer.
<SYNC Start=2060942><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, I know that.
<SYNC Start=2062399><P Class=ENCC>
That's precisely why you're here.
<SYNC Start=2064245><P Class=ENCC>
You see, Terri and I, we have...<br>
some merchandise we'd like to sell.
<SYNC Start=2068087><P Class=ENCC>
Open, open, open.
<SYNC Start=2069678><P Class=ENCC>
Some bank certificates.
<SYNC Start=2071997><P Class=ENCC>
Now, there's a man in Chicago named<br>
Mr. Cronin who would like to buy them.
<SYNC Start=2076835><P Class=ENCC>
But we're afraid of approaching him.
<SYNC Start=2079055><P Class=ENCC>
Because we don't know<br>
if he's being watched by the police.
<SYNC Start=2081448><P Class=ENCC>
So my question is...
<SYNC Start=2083936><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2084174><P Class=ENCC>
is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?
<SYNC Start=2087556><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2089250><P Class=ENCC>
I don't know.
<SYNC Start=2091702><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2097064><P Class=ENCC>
Have you ever seen<br>
the movie 'Marathon man', Mr. Monk?
<SYNC Start=2099220><P Class=ENCC>
No, is it good?
<SYNC Start=2100916><P Class=ENCC>
Let's watch it.
<SYNC Start=2102563><P Class=ENCC>
Let's, let's watch it now.
<SYNC Start=2104625><P Class=ENCC>
I'm not much of a movie guy,
<SYNC Start=2108043><P Class=ENCC>
but I have some time now.
<SYNC Start=2111035><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2111214><P Class=ENCC>
Who's in it?
<SYNC Start=2112825><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2113026><P Class=ENCC>
Who's in that?
<SYNC Start=2114457><P Class=ENCC>
You're not gonna watch it,<br>
you're gonna live it.
<SYNC Start=2118287><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2121494><P Class=ENCC>
Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?<br>
Yes or no.
<SYNC Start=2123887><P Class=ENCC>
I don't know.
<SYNC Start=2125538><P Class=ENCC>
I wish I did. I really do.
<SYNC Start=2130453><P Class=ENCC>
But I don't know.
<SYNC Start=2132410><P Class=ENCC>
- Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?<br>
- No!
<SYNC Start=2135879><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2137489><P Class=ENCC>
- Is he under surveillance?<br>
- Yes. Okay, yes.
<SYNC Start=2140262><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. We know...
<SYNC Start=2142090><P Class=ENCC>
we know all about it.
<SYNC Start=2145422><P Class=ENCC>
You have to be careful.
<SYNC Start=2147825><P Class=ENCC>
You should be careful.
<SYNC Start=2149681><P Class=ENCC>
Now, I really wish<br>
I could believe you, Mr. Monk.
<SYNC Start=2153484><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2154639><P Class=ENCC>
Your teeth are perfect.
<SYNC Start=2157208><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2158257><P Class=ENCC>
I don't see a single cavity.
<SYNC Start=2161070><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2162921><P Class=ENCC>
Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?
<SYNC Start=2166069><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2169712><P Class=ENCC>
He's not saying anything.
<SYNC Start=2171538><P Class=ENCC>
Pass me the extractor please.
<SYNC Start=2173980><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2179624><P Class=ENCC>
I still don't see what's wrong<br>
with the Randy Disher project.
<SYNC Start=2182471><P Class=ENCC>
I never liked that name.
<SYNC Start=2184248><P Class=ENCC>
Even in high school.
<SYNC Start=2186524><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2187307><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.
<SYNC Start=2188736><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2192145><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, what about<br>
the Randy Disher experience?
<SYNC Start=2195519><P Class=ENCC>
How about severe tire damage?
<SYNC Start=2197617><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, how about mellow knights with a K?
<SYNC Start=2202130><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2204431><P Class=ENCC>
I gotta say I'm leaning towards<br>
the Randy Disher experience.
<SYNC Start=2207149><P Class=ENCC>
How about this?
<SYNC Start=2208550><P Class=ENCC>
I'm gonna open up a newspaper<br>
and the first word I see...
<SYNC Start=2213535><P Class=ENCC>
that's our name.
<SYNC Start=2215978><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2216846><P Class=ENCC>
Baghdad.
<SYNC Start=2218697><P Class=ENCC>
That's good actually.<br>
I kind of like that.
<SYNC Start=2220225><P Class=ENCC>
- Baghdad.<br>
- Let me see that.
<SYNC Start=2223029><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2226011><P Class=ENCC>
$13 million in bearer bonds stolen.
<SYNC Start=2229308><P Class=ENCC>
Bearer bonds. Barry Bonds.
<SYNC Start=2232129><P Class=ENCC>
Not Barry bonds.
<SYNC Start=2234039><P Class=ENCC>
They were saying bearer bonds!
<SYNC Start=2235994><P Class=ENCC>
All right!<br>
All right, okay! Wait, wait.
<SYNC Start=2240726><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2241780><P Class=ENCC>
Your hands are so dirty.
<SYNC Start=2246039><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2246203><P Class=ENCC>
- Excuse me?<br>
- Could you...
<SYNC Start=2248356><P Class=ENCC>
you gotta wash your hands first.<br>
Please.
<SYNC Start=2254022><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2254347><P Class=ENCC>
- You want me to wash my hands.<br>
- Please.
<SYNC Start=2256280><P Class=ENCC>
- I'm not gonna wash my hands, okay?<br>
- Please.
<SYNC Start=2258597><P Class=ENCC>
I'm not washing my hands.<br>
Okay, now, just hold still.
<SYNC Start=2261927><P Class=ENCC>
We're not animals, here, right?<br>
Please, I'm asking you.
<SYNC Start=2265507><P Class=ENCC>
I'm asking you.
<SYNC Start=2267415><P Class=ENCC>
- He did wash his hands in Marathon man.<br>
- Don't give me "In Marathon Man."
<SYNC Start=2269974><P Class=ENCC>
I'm not gonna wash my hand when<br>
I'm torturing him. / It'll take,<br>
it'll take five seconds, please.
<SYNC Start=2273054><P Class=ENCC>
I'm asking you!
<SYNC Start=2275420><P Class=ENCC>
Look into your heart. For god.<br>
For the love of god.
<SYNC Start=2278643><P Class=ENCC>
For all that's holy.<br>
Look into your heart.
<SYNC Start=2281079><P Class=ENCC>
- Look into your heart.<br>
- I'll wash my damn hands, okay?
<SYNC Start=2284853><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2288760><P Class=ENCC>
Look, the lights are on.
<SYNC Start=2290916><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2297877><P Class=ENCC>
No! No, not the wrong soap.
<SYNC Start=2300654><P Class=ENCC>
- You gotta use the anti-bacterial soap!<br>
- Give me the drill. / Not the wrong soap!
<SYNC Start=2304828><P Class=ENCC>
All right, this is enough, already.<br>
Just give me the drill.
<SYNC Start=2307050><P Class=ENCC>
Not that soap.
<SYNC Start=2309307><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2314983><P Class=ENCC>
Drop the drill!<br>
Step away from the chair!
<SYNC Start=2317059><P Class=ENCC>
- Don't move, Natalie. Stay there.<br>
- Easy, you too.
<SYNC Start=2318758><P Class=ENCC>
Get over here.
<SYNC Start=2320374><P Class=ENCC>
Down. Down on your knees now.<br>
Both of you. 
<SYNC Start=2322356><P Class=ENCC>
You okay?
<SYNC Start=2323586><P Class=ENCC>
- I don't have my cuffs.<br>
- Here.
<SYNC Start=2327401><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2328974><P Class=ENCC>
- Give me your hands.<br>
- Mr. Monk, it's okay, it's okay.
<SYNC Start=2333048><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2333434><P Class=ENCC>
It's all over.
<SYNC Start=2334912><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

It doesn't matter.<br>
I mean, the band broke up anyway.
<SYNC Start=2406381><P Class=ENCC>
We couldn't agree on anything.
<SYNC Start=2407707><P Class=ENCC>
Name, what kind of music to play.
<SYNC Start=2410305><P Class=ENCC>
Or whether or not I should shut up.

Are you okay?
<SYNC Start=2434565><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2434855><P Class=ENCC>
- Loose tooth.<br>
- Huh?
<SYNC Start=2438372><P Class=ENCC>
I betcha that happened<br>
when they knocked him out.
<SYNC Start=2440522><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, gosh, you gotta see a dentist.
