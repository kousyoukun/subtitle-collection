1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,199
We're ahead of schedule.
That's a first, huh?

2
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,241
Wanna grab some coffee?

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:12,938
No. I gotta get home.
We're meeting the wedding planner.

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,947
I thought
that was last night.

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,950
No, last night was the caterer.
Should have taken my advice.

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,952
Should have just eloped.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,750
Well, it's too late now.
No, it's not, man.
You can do it.

8
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:26,758
Hop on a plane tonight.
Go to Vegas.
Boom. It's all over.

9
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:30,887
Rachel's mom
would never speak to me again.

10
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,898
That's the best argument
to do it.

11
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,560
I been trying to get
my mother-in-law to shut up
for five years.

12
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:38,365
- Whoa, what's this?
- What the hell are they doing?

13
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:44,967
Hit the brakes!
I'm trying!

14
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,275
Try the emergency brake!
This is Baker Four.

15
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,815
We're on Vinton and Hillside.
It's a hijacking.

16
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,874
I repeat,
we are being hijacked.

17
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,283
They're jammin' us.

18
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,927
Police found the truck.
It's been sittin' here for three days.

19
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,327
Thanks. And they left
most of the cash.

20
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,331
Yes, sir.

21
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,333
And these are the drivers.

22
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,392
Yeah. The M.E.
said they put up a fight.

23
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,462
I mean, blood everywhere,
like there was a struggle.

24
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,600
Well, good for them.
Maybe they injured
one of the bastards.

25
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:27,203
Let's check the hospitals.
I want a list of all gunshot wounds,
knife wounds.

26
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,305
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,816
You okay?
Oh, toothache.

28
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:35,048
Is that the same tooth?
I told you to take care
of that.

29
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:37,715
Yeah, I am.
Chewin' on the other side.

30
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,226
It's fine.
I hardly notice it.

31
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,593
You're crying.
Randy, you're no good to me
like this.

32
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,896
Go to a dentist.
I have an appointment.
Saturday.

33
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:51,937
Oh, I get it.
You don't want to
use up your sick days.

34
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:56,601
You're saving your sick days
for when you're not feeling sick.
Is that it?

35
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:01,970
I'm gonna go talk to Monk.
You made me wanna talk to Monk.

36
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:16,454
I just heard one of those guys
was about to get married.

37
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,123
Randy?

38
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,133
I know. I know.
It's heartbreaking.

39
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,135
They were so young.

40
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,264
Sweetie, it's okay to cry.

41
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,604
It means you have a heart.

42
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,610
Here, look at me.

43
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,943
You're a compassionate person.
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

44
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,948
It hurts.

45
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,007
Yeah, I know.
I know it hurts.

46
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,449
You don't want anybody
to see you?

47
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,494
I understand.

48
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,462
You know what,
if anyone says anything,
we'll just say-

49
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,625
Oh, my tooth. Oh.
Yeah, perfect!
That you have a toothache.

50
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,726
Oh, God!
God, this hurts!

51
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,737
Okay, I think
that's overdoing it.

52
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,739
Oh, please, Jesus.
Somebody just shoot me.

53
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,741
Randy, no one's gonna
believe that.

54
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,970
There's some oil on the floor.

55
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,446
Is that a clue?
Is that important?

56
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,278
Nah. There's oil
on the floor.

57
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,319
I'll call the E.P.A.

58
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,320
So, do you, uh-

59
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,447
Any ideas about the robbery?

60
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,014
Did you notice the back bumper,
how damaged it was?
Yeah.

61
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,688
These side mirrors are pushed in.

62
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,857
I don't think this armored car
was driven here.

63
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,226
It wasn't?
No.

64
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:36,208
I think it was carried somehow
in the back of a bigger truck.

65
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,767
You can see the tire tracks
from a larger vehicle.

66
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,779
You're right.

67
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,374
It was probably an 18-wheeler
about 14 feet wide.

68
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,953
So they brought
the armored car here,
they unload it.

69
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,891
How did they get the drivers
out of the cab?

70
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,660
With this.
Piece of rubber tubing.

71
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:06,565
They drilled the hole here
in the Plexiglas.

72
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,874
They gassed 'em out.

73
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,741
Huh. Randy.

74
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,941
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
Bag this stuff.

75
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,746
He has a toothache.

76
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,788
Yeah, I know.
He's been bitching
about it all week.

77
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,914
What, it's a real toothache?
Yeah.

78
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,017
I can't believe
you lied to me like that.

79
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:31,655
- Why didn't you just say,
"I have a toothache"?
- I did, like 10 times.

80
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:35,167
Randy, if you don't take care
of this tooth immediately, today,

81
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,828
I'm gonna rip it out myself.
You understand?

82
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,838
Fine.

83
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,265
What?

84
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,279
Mr. Disher?

85
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,320
Yeah.
Oh, good.

86
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,652
I'm Terri.
You do all your paperwork?

87
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,284
Both sides.
Good boy.

88
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,625
Yeah. Where's your receptionist?

89
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,187
Oh. Our nighttime receptionist quit.

90
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,199
Couldn't stand
the excitement, huh?

91
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,395
I guess not.
So you're gonna be in room "B."

92
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:15,737
- That's between "A" and "C."
- Well, what if I get lost?

93
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,742
You want me
to draw you a map?

94
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,744
Yeah, I think I can find it.

95
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,905
Okay. I'll be right in.

96
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:31,848
<i>Well, Mr. Disher,</i>
<i>I'm Oliver Bloom.</i>

97
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,722
Don't get up. Just kidding.
You're a lieutenant. Am I right?

98
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,887
Yeah.
I can usually guess
within one rank.

99
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,454
I see a lot of cops in here.
We're on the medical plan.

100
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,762
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

101
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,200
Oh, that's not a problem.

102
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,205
We're open late
on Tuesdays and Thursdays
in case of emergencies.

103
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,707
Also to keep Terri here
off the streets.

104
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,710
He worries about me.

105
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,178
I do. You know what
I'm really worried about?

106
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,477
I worry about
this bad boy right here,

107
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,483
your number three molar.

108
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,213
Terri, can I have
a light, please?
Mm-hmm.

109
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,312
I want you to open wide...

110
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,051
and just try to relax.

111
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,719
Little wider.
Okay, just relax.

112
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,286
- Okay, okay.
A little sensitive.

113
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,822
<i>Well, I hope you're not</i>
<i>in love with that tooth,</i>
<i>Lieutenant,</i>

114
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,835
because I'm afraid
it's gonna have to go.

115
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,838
We can either pull it next week,
or we can do it today.

116
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,534
- The choice is yours.
- Let's do it now.

117
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,771
Okay, Randy,
we're gonna put you under
for about 30 minutes.

118
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,837
- Not gonna feel a thing.
- Uh-huh.

119
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:32,180
As a matter of fact,
you're gonna be back here
every week for this.

120
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,709
And if you're a really good boy,
I'm gonna give you a sticker
afterwards.

121
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,120
What if I'm a bad boy?

122
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,817
<i>Just breathe.</i>

123
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:45,193
Breathe normally. Relax.
I know it's hard with Terri
standing over you.

124
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:48,324
Can you hear me?

125
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:52,497
Just relax.
I want you to take
10 deep breaths. Okay?

126
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,632
One. Two.

127
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,699
Three.

128
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,245
Four.

129
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,304
<i>Five.</i>

130
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:09,315
Ter, I'm gonna need
the angle director probe
again, please.

131
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,447
Angle director probe.

132
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,396
Doctor, wait.
I think he's coming awake again.

133
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,895
<i>Come on.</i>

134
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,566
<i>Hey!</i>

135
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,577
What are you doing
here?

136
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,613
<i>What did you do with</i>
<i>Barry Bonds?</i>

137
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,706
<i>I know he's here somewhere.</i>
<i>What did you do?</i>
<i>I know he's here.</i>

138
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,946
What are you talking about?
Barry Bonds.

139
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,954
We don't know
Barry Bonds.

140
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,490
He's worth $13 million.
What did you do with him?

141
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,856
We have a patient here.
Yeah, we have a patient here-

142
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,861
Barry Bonds. I-

143
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,863
No! Wait-

144
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,092
<i>Hey!</i>

145
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,191
<i>Hey, cut it out.</i>

146
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,862
<i>I'm a police officer.</i>

147
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,101
<i>I'm a police officer.</i>

148
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,378
Hey, sleeping beauty.

149
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,516
Welcome back.

150
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:16,146
Are you all right?
Am I all right?
Why wouldn't I be?

151
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,385
There was a man in here.

152
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,449
<i>She has men in here</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

153
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,824
You-You were fighting.

154
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,164
Oh, there was a fight,
all right, between me
and this molar here.

155
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,170
It didn't wanna come out.

156
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,172
There's gonna be
some sensitivity for a few days.

157
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,674
I wrote you a prescription.
It should help with the pain.

158
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:41,577
- Don't take more than one
every four hours.
- Oh, and I almost forgot.

159
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,945
Your sticker.

160
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,290
<i>Captain, there are no reports</i>
<i>of any stolen trucks.</i>

161
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,229
Well, keep looking.
Widen the net.

162
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,233
Start at Seattle
and work your way south.

163
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,201
Captain, here's a copy
of the updated manifest.

164
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,603
The cash was new, right?
Yes, sir. It would have been
easily traced.

165
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:12,269
All they took were the negotiable
bank certificates. Over $10 million.
All right. Let's follow the money.

166
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,644
How many fences in the country
could handle a haul like this?
I'll find out.

167
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,649
Captain.
Randy. Welcome back.

168
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,015
You're working with Patterson
on the bank certificates.

169
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,987
Get me Frank Davis
at the Treasury Department
on the line.

170
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:26,616
Put a list together of all the fences.
Any fence in the country-
Captain, do you have a minute?

171
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,887
Yeah, what's up?

172
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,862
It's about my dentist.
Uh, Dr. Bloom?

173
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,865
Yeah?

174
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,924
I think, um-

175
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,899
I think he might-
Did he touch you? Inappropriately?

176
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,166
No. Jesus! No! No.

177
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:50,140
- I think he killed a guy.
- He what?

178
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,241
It happened.

179
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,809
I think that he-
Dr. Bloom and his assistant Terri-

180
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:57,185
I think they murdered someone.

181
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:01,056
You saw it?
Yeah, sort of. I was sedated.

182
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:04,290
Uh-You were sedated.

183
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:09,232
Randy, one time I was
under anesthesia, and I thought
my mustache was a chipmunk.

184
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,496
I was the Green Lantern once.

185
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,164
It was great.
I didn't wanna wake up.

186
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,437
Look, I was supposed to be out
for 30 minutes.
Mm-hmm.

187
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,444
But I was under
for almost two hours.

188
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,503
Was there a body?
No.

189
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,172
Any signs of a struggle?
No.

190
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:26,218
Who did they kill?
I don't know. It was a guy.

191
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,482
Male. Caucasian.
5'11", 200 pounds.

192
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:33,457
- They were arguing about Barry Bonds,
and I'm pretty sure that I can I.D. him.
- Baseball player?

193
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:39,192
Yeah! I think that this guy
thought that Dr. Bloom
kidnapped Barry Bonds.

194
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:42,098
They were arguing about
how much Barry Bonds was worth.

195
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,796
If your dentist played baseball,
you know what team he'd play for.

196
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,235
The Yanks.
Get it?

197
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,708
It's not funny.

198
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:54,644
It's a little funny, Randy.

199
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,806
Look, why don't you, um-

200
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,283
Take a walk.

201
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:03,844
Clear your head. Here.
Drop this off at Monk's.
He's waiting for this.

202
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:08,155
Then take the rest
of the day off, okay?
Go to the movies, go to the beach.

203
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,424
Okay? Get out of here.
I'll call you later.

204
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,029
- Is this everything?
The whole file?
- Yeah.

205
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,102
Monk, can I ask you a question?

206
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:26,941
<i>What do you, uh, normally charge,</i>
<i>you know, for someone</i>
<i>who wants to hire you?</i>

207
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:30,072
I mean, not the department.
A private party.

208
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:33,312
- Like who?
- Like me.

209
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:36,252
Is this about the dentist?
The captain called us.

210
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:39,291
<i>He said you had a reaction</i>
<i>to the anesthesia.</i>

211
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:42,885
- You were probably hallucinating.
- No, I wasn't hallucinating.

212
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,590
It really happened.
I mean, it-

213
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:48,531
It was as real as you are right now
standing in front of me.

214
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,592
Randy.

215
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:53,263
I'm not standing.

216
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,703
But if you need my help,
you don't have to pay me.

217
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,111
All you have to do is ask.

218
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:06,140
I mean, you're
one of my oldest friends.
I've known you for years.

219
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:13,853
- Thank you. I want you to come back
to the dentist's office with me-
- Let me finish.

220
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:18,727
- Unfortunately, at the moment,
I have a lot of things on my plate.
- No, you don't.

221
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,824
Well, I- I have
this armored car thing.

222
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,530
I have to read this whole file.
That's about 120 pages.

223
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,572
And I just found a typo,
by the way.

224
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,235
And I have to replace
the lint filter on my dryer.

225
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,575
Filters do not
replace themselves.
Mr. Monk, can I talk to you for a minute?

226
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,582
I have to talk to Natalie
for a minute. What?
<i>Privately?</i>

227
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,710
In the kitchen. Now.
Okay.

228
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,777
Go.

229
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,594
Mr. Monk,
this is Randy we're talking about.
He would do anything for-

230
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,130
And I would do anything for him
except this, Natalie.

231
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,428
I can't do it.
I have a <i>thing</i> about dentists.

232
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,468
You have a thing about everything.

233
00:13:56,535 --> 00:14:00,232
That's true.
But dentists are in a separate category
all together. Okay?

234
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,571
I can't even discuss it.
I can't even think about
discussing it.

235
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,872
I can't even talk about
thinking about discussing it.

236
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:09,176
Mr. Monk,
everybody's afraid of dentists.
Not like this.

237
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:12,115
Not like this.
Okay, okay, okay. How afraid are you
on a scale of one to 10?

238
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:16,120
Ten? I am so far beyond 10,
I laugh at your 10s.

239
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,089
I lie awake at night
dreaming about 10s.

240
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:22,093
The chair and the probing
and the drilling and the rinsing.

241
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,755
Okay, Mr. Monk,
what do you do
when you get a cavity?

242
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,764
I don't get a cavity.
I don't get cavities.

243
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,130
I brush my teeth 12 times a day
and I floss every 90 minutes.

244
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,398
So you've never been to a dentist.
Once. When I was 12.

245
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,632
- How'd that go?
- Not well.

246
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,402
This is ridiculous.
We're just gonna go there
and look around.

247
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,139
You're not a patient.
You're not sitting
in the chair.

248
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,944
There's no probing.
There's no drilling.
I'll be with you the whole time.

249
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,781
But I-
No.

250
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,617
Oh, boy.

251
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,958
He's happy to do it.

252
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,994
Great.

253
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,571
I don't see anything.

254
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,938
It happened
in the other room.
Room "B."

255
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,307
What do you think?

256
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,312
Psst. Mr. Monk.

257
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,348
Pretty sure...

258
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,578
this is how the Nazis
decorated their bunkers.

259
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,984
Don't look at that.
Look-Look-Look down.

260
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,386
Look at the carpet.
What a beautiful carpet.

261
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,424
It is a beautiful carpet.
Right? Is that better?

262
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,426
It is better.

263
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,691
Oh. <i>Highlights for Children.</i>

264
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,392
Oh, "find the hidden picture."
I used to love these.

265
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,696
"Where is the eggbeater?"

266
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,760
It's under the sled.

267
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,706
You're right.

268
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,767
And the umbrella
is in the cloud above the snowman.

269
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,903
And the fish
is next to the ice skate.

270
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,039
Okay, how are you
doing that?

271
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:55,143
I read that same issue
35 years ago. It was in the-

272
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,649
It was in...
a dentist's office.

273
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:04,321
Natalie, I- I can't do this.
No, no, no, no, no.
You can do this.

274
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,557
You can do this.
You're doing great.
Well-

275
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,533
Okay, here. Sit down and think
about something else, okay?

276
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,798
Here. I brought the case file.
Concentrate on this.

277
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,073
Lieutenant.
You back for more?

278
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,135
No. No.

279
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:24,842
Actually, I think
I just left my cellphone
in the chair in room "B."

280
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,078
Oh. Well, it's empty now
if you wanna take a look.

281
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,120
Great.

282
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,179
I'm Natalie.
I'm just gonna help him.

283
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,247
He can't ever find anything.

284
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,759
I'm gonna be right back.
I'm gonna be right here.
Are you okay?

285
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,854
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm good.

286
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:52,410
Okay. I was in the chair.
Mm-hmm.

287
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,276
And-They were fighting
over there.

288
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,941
Okay. Well,
I don't see anything.

289
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,456
He bought new equipment.

290
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:11,052
He- He bought new equipment
to replace the stuff
that got broken during the fight.

291
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,255
Maybe.

292
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,473
- What's that?
- It's a drill.

293
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,914
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not afraid.

294
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:37,451
Don't be afraid.

295
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,451
Don't be afraid.

296
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,492
<i>Mr. Monk, it's okay.</i>

297
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,502
We're gonna go home now.
You can let go.
No, we're not going anywhere.

298
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,505
He hasn't seen anything.
I think he's seen enough.

299
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,669
Is there a problem?
Oh. No, no. I just left my cellphone
in the other room.

300
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,236
Dr. Bloom,
this is Adrian Monk.
He's a friend of mine.

301
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,782
<i>The</i> Adrian Monk? The detective?
It's a pleasure to meet you.

302
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,685
- Apparently, the pleasure's all mine.
- He just has a little thing
about dentists.

303
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,851
You know,
it happens to me all the time.
I don't take it personally.

304
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,760
Let me help you with that.

305
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:21,161
Oh, are you working
on the armored car case?

306
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:24,725
I've been reading about it.
I'm a bit of a true crime aficionado.

307
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,862
I'm sorry.
That's classified.

308
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,102
Got a couple of hobbies then.
True crime and baseball.

309
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,871
Baseball?
Baseball?

310
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,711
Yeah. I'm sure I heard you guys
talking about Barry Bonds yesterday.

311
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,775
You know what?
People hear a lot of crazy things
when they're under sedation.

312
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:44,152
They say a lot of
crazy things too.
I should write a book, really.

313
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:47,090
Yes, sir. I understand.
Okay. We're on our way.

314
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,320
We gotta go.
That was the captain.
Oh! We gotta go.

315
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:52,056
Okay. Take care.

316
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,134
A couple of fishermen
just found him.

317
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,642
Well, these two bruises,
10 inches apart-

318
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,373
There's another set of bruises
exactly 10 inches apart.

319
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,381
Yeah. What caused that?

320
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,577
Well, must be something
10 inches apart.

321
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,713
- Thanks a lot.
- Well, what do you got?
You said it was important.

322
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:21,384
I found this in his trousers.
It was in his pants cuff.

323
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,428
It's Plexiglas.

324
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,932
He's gotta be
one of the hijackers.
He drilled the hole.

325
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,595
So who is he?
Turn him over.

326
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,737
- <i>I don't recognize him.</i>
<i>Do you?</i>
- No.

327
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,742
Oh, my God.

328
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,779
That's the guy.
That's the guy
from the dentist's office.

329
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,611
Randy, I told you
to take some time off.

330
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,617
No, Captain, that's the guy.

331
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,279
I told you I could I.D. him,
and that is definitely the guy.

332
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,619
This is the guy
that your dentist killed
along with his hygienist?

333
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:57,128
- That's right.
- This is the guy that they killed in front
of you while you were in the chair.

334
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,427
That's right.
Because Dr. Bloom
kidnapped Barry Bonds,

335
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,967
and they were arguing
about the ransom money.

336
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,969
Yeah, what,
is that so crazy?

337
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,301
What the hell are you
laughin' at, Patterson?

338
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,932
I'm not crazy.
Nobody said you were crazy,
Randy.

339
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,602
Out loud.
You should have had 'em
put some wisdom teeth in.

340
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,909
Hey, you can't even spell
wisdom teeth, Downey.
All right, look, Natalie.

341
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,472
What?
You and Monk were there, right?
Did you notice anything?

342
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,213
Mmm. No, I- I wasn't really
on my game.

343
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:25,120
<i>I have this thing</i>
<i>about dentists.</i>

344
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,556
Kroger calls it
a super-megaphobia.

345
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:31,221
If germs are here
and snakes are here,
dentists are-

346
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:34,163
You see that branch up there,
the second one from the top?

347
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,224
The one above that one.

348
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:39,930
Captain, are you going to
investigate this or not?

349
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,634
Randy, you were sedated.
You couldn't have seen anything.

350
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,944
Fine. I quit.

351
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,505
You what?
No, I quit.

352
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,677
I'm sick and tired
of being treated like
the village idiot.

353
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,914
Here's my gun.
Randy, come on.

354
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,923
And my badge.
I'm not a joke.

355
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,755
I'm not here to entertain you.
I'm a homicide detective.

356
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:05,126
Randy, don't be ridiculous.
Take it.

357
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,792
Randy.

358
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,864
Randy.

359
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,813
Captain, they just I.D.'d the body.
Are you ready for this?

360
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,817
It's Denny Jardeen.

361
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,819
Ooh. I know that name.

362
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,879
Yeah, he's an ex-cop.
Worked the Mission District.
He was bad news.

363
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:38,089
He was charged five times.
Excessive force, conduct unbecoming.

364
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:42,759
Took an early retirement
four years ago.
Thanks.

365
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,671
What's he doing?

366
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,401
Flossing. He's determined
never to go back
to a dentist again.

367
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,410
Just pretend I'm not here.
- Monk, cut it out.

368
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,810
I mean it.
This is a floss-free zone.

369
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:01,309
Since when?
<i>Since right now.</i>
<i>Cut it out.</i>

370
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,247
What's this?
That's nothing.

371
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,725
Background check,
Oliver Bloom.

372
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,762
You're checking out
the dentist?

373
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,263
Yeah. I figured
it couldn't hurt
to check him out.

374
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,733
You're doing this for Randy,
aren't you?
Why don't you just call him?

375
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,929
Because he quit.

376
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:23,270
Randy is an adult.
He made a decision,
and I respect it.

377
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,936
You miss him.
I can tell.

378
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,673
Look, Natalie, it's not like
we were going steady, okay?

379
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,942
We worked together.
He was just another cop.

380
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,179
That is not true.
You're right. It's not true.

381
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:38,382
He's not just another cop.
He was the single most annoying
human being to ever wear a badge.

382
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,924
Present company excepted.

383
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:49,626
Okay, you guys.
Let's try this new one.

384
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,602
I printed up
some lyric sheets.

385
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:55,799
Why do we need lyric sheets?
You're the only one singing.

386
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,901
Just so you can follow along
so you know what it's about.

387
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,572
- We're making a statement.
- We are?

388
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,248
Okay. Let's do it.
From the top.

389
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,981
A-five, six, seven, eight.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

390
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,751
- What was that?
- Countin' off.

391
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,758
Five, six, seven, eight?

392
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:18,057
<i>That's for dancing.</i>
No, it's not.

393
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,360
You're supposed to go,
"One, two, three, four."

394
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,629
- Come on. What's the difference?
- It's rock and roll, man.

395
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:27,160
Let's do that blues song
we used to do.

396
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,173
Guys. Guys, guys, guys, guys.
Hey, guys, guys!

397
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,300
Why don't we just stick
to the original material?

398
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,901
Okay? That's what
the people wanna hear.

399
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:37,244
<i>What people, Randy?</i>
<i>We're in my stepfather's garage.</i>

400
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,647
Well, Aaron, there might be
people one day.

401
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:45,018
I mean, touring. Record deal.
Come on, guys.
Wasn't that the dream?

402
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,753
Maybe... 17 years ago...
in 12th grade.

403
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,761
Well, you know what?

404
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:53,024
I still believe in the dream.

405
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,066
I believe in the Randy Disher Project.

406
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,192
Come on. I quit my job for this.

407
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,705
- Big mistake.
- All right. Let's just do it, okay?

408
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:03,640
From the top.

409
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:07,940
If you say "five, six, seven, eight" again,
I quit. I'm just telling you.

410
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,777
Do you know what?
Do you wanna be the lead singer?
'Scuse me.

411
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:15,877
Uh- Can I talk to Mick Jagger
for a second?

412
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,721
Yeah. Sure.
All right, guys.
Take a break, huh?

413
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,284
Oh, it's a really good job so far though.
Really good.

414
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:27,229
He quit his job.

415
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,427
How's it going?
It's good. It's great.

416
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,471
I should have done this
years ago.
Yeah, it's pretty exciting.

417
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:38,168
Um-You gotta send me a T-shirt
or a hat or something.

418
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:43,171
Or whatever.
Uh, listen.

419
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:47,378
I thought you might be interested.
We caught a break
on the armored car thing.

420
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:51,354
We identified the body.
Guy's name is Denny Jardeen.
He's an ex-cop.

421
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,755
He's got a cousin
who's done some time...

422
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,759
who works for
a trucking company.

423
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,558
So we're gonna go pick him up.
I thought you'd like to come along.

424
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:04,068
Why? I mean, I'm not a cop
anymore, Leland. Captain.

425
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:08,128
Look. It's my notebook.
No more witness statements.

426
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:10,674
Just lyrics
and song ideas now.

427
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:14,405
You're writing songs?
Yeah, I wrote 17 last night.

428
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,640
I'm on fire.

429
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,649
I'm sure you are.

430
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,742
Uh-

431
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,754
I also wanted to apologize
about the dentist.

432
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,756
It's-

433
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:30,693
It's just that over the years
you've had, uh, s-
so many unique theories.

434
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:35,495
I wasn't hallucinating.
Randy, I checked Dr. Bloom out
myself on my own time.

435
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,660
The guy is clean.

436
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:40,933
He's got no priors.
He's never been in trouble.

437
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,074
Just wanted you to know
that I took you seriously.

438
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:53,148
The fact is, I miss you.
I need you.

439
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,289
Well, it's too late.

440
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:01,723
I- I'm moved on.

441
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,784
I mean,
band's my life now.

442
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,626
You're more than welcome
to come and have a listen
if you want.

443
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,632
Come on in. Be my guest.

444
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,691
Have a seat.

445
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,829
Okay. How you doing?

446
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,167
<i>Hey.</i>

447
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,234
I should warn you.
You might not like
what you hear.

448
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,770
It's pretty powerful stuff.
You might not be able
to handle it.

449
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,941
All right,
let's rock it out.

450
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,918
<i>From the top.</i>
<i>A-one, two, three, four.</i>

451
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,682
Five, six, seven, eight.

452
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,161
All right.

453
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,996
<i>That was good.</i>
<i>That wasn't too bad.</i>

454
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,129
That was great.

455
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:28,011
Okay, now before you even
knock on the door,

456
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,448
I want you to douse this handkerchief
with the chloroform,
just like this, okay?

457
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:36,681
About 20 c.c.'s.
And make sure
he really inhales it.

458
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,780
I don't know about this.

459
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,848
Well, we have to do it.
There's no choice.

460
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:44,326
No, no. I know.
I mean, I don't know
if 20 c.c.'s is enough.

461
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,864
How do you know
he's gonna talk?

462
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:50,332
Did you see him?
He couldn't even shake my hand.
He was a mess.

463
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,734
Yeah.
You get Adrian Monk
in here,

464
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:55,739
and I'll make him talk.

465
00:27:56,808 --> 00:28:01,268
Neal, your fingerprints
were all over the warehouse
and on the armored car.

466
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,280
You could hire
the best lawyer in the city.

467
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,543
<i>He's not gonna make</i>
<i>those fingerprints disappear.</i>

468
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:08,017
<i>It is all over, and you know it.</i>

469
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,890
Okay.

470
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:17,450
I was there, but I did-
I didn't do the two guards, man. I-

471
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,463
I tried to stop him.

472
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:23,695
- Stop who?
- Denny. Denny Jardeen.

473
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,030
When the guards fought back,
he went postal, man,
and started shootin'.

474
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:33,510
- Where's the money, Neal?
- Denny's got it.

475
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:36,741
He's keeping it in a shed
back behind his place
until we all split it up.

476
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:40,273
I got some bad news
for ya, Neal.
Denny is dead.

477
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,778
- Denny?
- And there's no money
in that little tool shed.

478
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:48,053
- We've already ripped it apart.
- Ah, that's impossible.

479
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:51,721
Looks like somebody
in your little sewing circle
got greedy.

480
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:56,567
You can't trust anybody
these days, can you?

481
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:16,884
Mr. Monk.

482
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:19,719
I know it's late.
Can I come in?

483
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,725
Of course. Of course.

484
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,353
Thank you.

485
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,964
W-W-What is it?

486
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:30,364
Lieutenant Disher
was right.

487
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:36,270
Dr. Bloom killed a man
two days ago, and I don't
even know who it was.

488
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:39,003
I mean, I've never
seen him before or anything.

489
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:43,305
I just don't know
where else to go.

490
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,544
Yeah. A-Are you gonna
be crying a lot?

491
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,384
Maybe you wanna
lean over the sink.

492
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,425
No, no. I'm fine.
I'm sorry.
I'm just scared to death.

493
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,460
Yeah. I'll call the captain.

494
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:59,463
No! No. Dr. Bloom
would kill me.
You can't.

495
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,999
Oh, it's okay.
The police will protect you.

496
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:06,162
Oh. What is that?
What? What, what?

497
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,398
I don't know.
What is it?

498
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:12,204
It's right-
It's something on your face,
like a smudge.

499
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,336
Smudge.

500
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:17,108
Yeah. No. No,
you're not getting it.
It's right there.

501
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,514
Did I get it?
No.

502
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,917
Here, I'll do it.
Hold on. Okay.

503
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,781
Did you get it?
Uh-

504
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,383
No?
No. It's right there.

505
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:34,725
Chloroform.

506
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,324
You're d-
You're drugging me.
Shh.

507
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,461
Just relax.

508
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,630
Did you get it?

509
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,435
Did I get it?

510
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,742
Did I get it?

511
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,517
Did I get it?

512
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,863
<i>Natalie.</i>
Captain, is Mr. Monk here?

513
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:10,423
What would Monk be doing here?
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

514
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:14,335
I called his house to read him
tomorrow's weather report
like always, but he didn't answer.

515
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:18,136
So I go over there. The door's open.
The light's on, but he's not home.

516
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:22,145
The door was open?

517
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:57,914
Thank you for waiting.
The doctor will be right with you.

518
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:00,280
There's... no rush.

519
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,652
Why are you doing this?

520
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,691
Why are you doing this?

521
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,826
Please.

522
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,132
What are you gonna do?

523
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,305
I didn't really have a smudge,
did I?

524
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,610
Ooh. You should be flattered.

525
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,878
The doctor doesn't usually
come in this late.

526
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,614
Especially for new patients.

527
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,679
That tooth.

528
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,358
The roots are about-

529
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:46,227
10 inches apart,
aren't they?

530
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,061
If you say so.

531
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:53,365
I get it now.
I know what happened.

532
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:57,238
<i>The drivers fought back</i>
<i>during the hijacking.</i>

533
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:00,038
<i>Denny Jardeen</i>
<i>got hit in the face.</i>

534
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,102
<i>He must have knocked</i>
<i>a tooth loose.</i>

535
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,440
Jardeen came here
to get his tooth fixed.

536
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,452
That makes sense.

537
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,354
He's an ex-cop,
and you're on the medical plan.

538
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:16,587
<i>He must have talked</i>
<i>in his sleep.</i>

539
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,027
<i>Dr. Bloom</i>
<i>said a lot of patients do.</i>

540
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:23,534
<i>He told you everything,</i>
<i>about the robbery,</i>
<i>where they hid the money.</i>

541
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:28,231
- It must have been like
winning the lottery.
- If you say so.

542
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:31,207
<i>That night,</i>
<i>you went to Jardeen's house,</i>

543
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,573
<i>found the money,</i>
<i>figured it was safe,</i>

544
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:36,613
<i>that he would never remember</i>
<i>telling you anything.</i>

545
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,842
But you were wrong.

546
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,850
He did remember.

547
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,320
Or maybe when
the money went missing,

548
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,517
he just figured it out.

549
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:53,730
<i>He came back here Tuesday night</i>
<i>when you were working on Randy.</i>

550
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,995
Randy witnessed
the whole thing, sort of.

551
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,541
He was right
about everything.

552
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,644
Wasn't he?

553
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,737
If you say so.

554
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,839
Hello again, Mr. Monk.

555
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:20,090
Is it true that you've only
been to the dentist once before?
Yeah.

556
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:23,127
I gather it wasn't
a good experience.

557
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,786
Oh, this will be much worse.

558
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:29,162
I'm-
I'm a police officer.

559
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,168
Oh, I know that.
That's precisely why you're here.

560
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:36,263
See, Terri and I,
we have some merchandise
that we'd like to sell.

561
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,467
Open, open, open.

562
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,534
Some bank certificates.

563
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:45,241
Now, there's a man
in Chicago named Mr. Cronin
who would like to buy them,

564
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:49,946
but we're afraid of approaching him
because we don't know if he's
being watched by the police.

565
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,285
Now, my question is...

566
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,347
is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?

567
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,786
I don't know.

568
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,200
Have you ever seen the movie
<i>Marathon Man</i>, Mr. Monk?

569
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:12,868
No. Is it good?
Let's watch.
Let's- Let's watch it now.

570
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,436
I'm not much of a movie guy,

571
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,142
but I have some time now.

572
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:22,277
Who's in it?
Who's in that?

573
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:24,719
You're not gonna <i>watch</i> it.

574
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,485
You're gonna live it.

575
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,295
Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?
Yes or no?

576
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,297
I don't know.

577
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,299
I wish I did. I- I-

578
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:40,064
I really wish I did.
I wish I did.

579
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,471
- Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?
- No!

580
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:48,808
Is he under surveillance?
Yes. Okay. Yes.

581
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,814
Yes.

582
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,680
We know-We know all about him.

583
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,481
You-You have to be careful.

584
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,545
You should be careful.

585
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,251
Now I really wish I could
believe you, Mr. Monk.

586
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,921
Your teeth are perfect.

587
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,932
I don't see a single cavity.

588
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,267
Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?

589
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,676
He's not saying anything.

590
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:22,338
Pass me the extractor, please.

591
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,914
I still don't see what's wrong
with the Randy Disher Project.

592
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:34,924
I never liked that name.
Even in high school.

593
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,517
Okay.

594
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:43,961
Okay. What about
the Randy Disher Experience?

595
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,196
How about Severe Tire Damage?

596
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:49,933
Okay. How about Mellow Knights
with a "K"?

597
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:56,580
I gotta say I'm leaning towards
the Randy Disher Experience.
<i>How about this?</i>

598
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:59,172
I'm gonna open up a newspaper...

599
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,117
and the first word I see,

600
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:04,120
that's our name.

601
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,122
Baghdad.

602
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,489
That's good, actually.
I kinda like that.
<i>Baghdad.</i>

603
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,824
Let me see that.

604
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,729
"13 million in bearer bonds stolen."

605
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,859
Bearer bonds. Barry Bonds.

606
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,964
Not Barry Bonds.
They were saying "bearer bonds."

607
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:28,501
Wait! Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

608
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:34,277
Your hands are so dirty.

609
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,718
- Excuse me?
- Could you-

610
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,449
You gotta wash your hands first.

611
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,855
Please. Please.

612
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:45,453
You want me to wash my hands.
Please.

613
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,121
I'm not gonna wash my hands,
okay?
Please.

614
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:50,361
I'm not washing my hands!
Okay, just hold still.
The sink's right over there.

615
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,665
We're not animals here, right?
Please, I'm asking you.

616
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:57,265
- I'm asking you!
- He did wash his hands
in <i>Marathon Man.</i>

617
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:00,208
Don't give me "In <i>Marathon Man</i>."
I'm not gonna wash my hands
when I'm torturing him.

618
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,714
It'll just take one second.
Please. I'm asking you!

619
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,875
Look into your heart.
For the love of God,

620
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,385
by all that's holy,
look into your heart.

621
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,149
Look into your heart.
I'll wash my damn hands, okay?

622
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:19,553
Look, the lights are on.

623
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,795
No! That's the wrong soap.

624
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,740
You gotta use
antibacterial soap.

625
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,743
Give me the drill.
Gotta use the right soap.

626
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,905
- This is enough already.
Just give me the drill.
- Not that soap!

627
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,316
Drop the drill!
Step away from the chair!

628
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,220
<i>Don't move, Natalie.</i>
<i>Stay there.</i>

629
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:50,590
- Get over there.
- Down. Down on your knees now.
Both of you.

630
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,391
- You okay?
- I don't have my cuffs.

631
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,455
Here.

632
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:01,271
<i>Your hands. Don't move.</i>
Mr. Monk? Oh, God. It's okay.

633
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,830
- Oh, God. It's all over.
- Sorry.

634
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:05,933
It's all over.

635
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,634
Wow. That had some good energy.

636
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,797
Yeah. A lot of energy.

637
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,472
Let's watch it again some time.

638
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:16,240
I-I-It doesn't matter.
The band broke up anyway.

639
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:19,771
We couldn't agree on anything:
name, what kind of music to play,

640
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,944
or whether or not
I should shut up.

641
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,789
Come here.

642
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,723
I believe this is yours.

643
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:40,700
Welcome back, Randy.

644
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,399
Welcome back.
You okay?

645
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:45,942
Mmm. Loose tooth.

646
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,972
Betcha that happened
when they knocked him out.

647
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,015
Oh, my gosh.
You gotta see a dentist.

648
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,050
Mmm. No.

649
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,053
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.
Mr. Monk,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

650
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,180
Mmm.
I'll be with you the whole time.

651
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:02,248
<i>Mm-mmm.</i>
<i>What are the odds</i>
<i>of another dentist torturing you?</i>

652
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,385
<i>Let's not talk about it anymore.</i>
