00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,241
Wanna grab some coffee?

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:12,938
No. I gotta get home.
We're meeting the wedding planner.

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,947
I thought
that was last night.

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,950
No, last night was the caterer.
Should have taken my advice.

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,952
Should have just eloped.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,750
Well, it's too late now.
No, it's not, man. You can do it.

8
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:26,758
Hop on a plane tonight.
Go to Vegas. Boom. It's all over.

9
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:30,887
Rachel's mom
would never speak to me again.

10
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,898
That's the best argument
to do it.

11
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,560
I been trying to get
my mother-in-law to shut up for five years.

12
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:38,365
- Whoa, what's this?
- What the hell are they doing?

13
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:44,967
Hit the brakes!
I'm trying!

14
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,275
Try the emergency brake!
This is Baker Four.

15
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,815
We're on Vinton and Hillside.
It's a hijacking.

16

believe that.

Is that important?

on the floor.

83
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,642
Any ideas about the robbery?

84
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:21,209
Did you notice the back bumper,
how damaged it was? Yeah.

85

These side mirrors are pushed in.

86
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:28,052
I don't think this armored car
was driven here.

87
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:31,421
It wasn't?
No.

88
00:04:31,498 --> 00:04:37,403
I think it was carried somehow
in the back of a bigger truck.

89
00:04:37,471 --> 00:04:39,962
You can see the tire tracks
from a larger vehicle.

You're right.

91
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:45,569
It was probably an 18-wheeler
about 14 feet wide.

92
00:04:47,314 --> 00:04:51,148
So they brought
the armored car here, they unload it.

93
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:55,086
How did they get the drivers
out of the cab?

Piece of rubber tubing.

"I have a toothache"? - I did, like 10 times.

104
00:05:32,926 --> 00:05:36,362
Randy, if you don't take care
of this tooth immediately, today,

105
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:39,023
I'm gonna rip it out myself.
You understand?

00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:41,033
Fine.

107

Oh. Our nighttime receptionist quit.

You have a thing about everything.

That's true.
But dentists are in a separate category all together. Okay?

I don't get a cavity.
I don't get cavities.

I brush my teeth 12 times a day
and I floss every 90 minutes.

So you've never been to a dentist.
Once. When I was 12.

- Not well.

You're not a patient.
You're not sitting in the chair.

Psst. Mr. Monk.

285
00:15:16,906 --> 00:15:18,874
Pretty sure...

286
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:22,104
this is how the Nazis
decorated their bunkers.

287

Don't look at that.
Look-Look-Look down.

288
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,912
Look at the carpet.
What a beautiful carpet.

289
00:15:26,982 --> 00:15:28,950
It is a beautiful carpet.
Right? Is that better?

290
00:15:29,018 --> 00:15:30,952

is in the cloud above the snowman.

Okay, how are you
doing that?

299

35 years ago. It was in the-

It was in...

No. No.

Yeah. Yeah. I'm good.

It's good. It's great.

450
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,179
I should have done this
years ago. Yeah, it's pretty exciting.

451
00:24:37,246 --> 00:24:41,876
Um-You gotta send me a T-shirt
or a hat or something.

Or whatever.
Uh, listen.

00:24:46,956 --> 00:24:51,086
I thought you might be interested.
We caught a break on the armored car thing.

454
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,062
We identified the body.
Guy's name is DennyJardeen. He's an ex-cop.

455
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:57,463
He's got a cousin
who's done some time...

456
00:24:57,533 --> 00:24:59,467
who works for
a trucking company.

457
00:24:59,535 --> 00:25:03,266
So we're gonna go pick him up.
I thought you'd like to come along.

Why? I mean, I'm not a cop
anymore, Leland. Captain.

Look. It's my notebook.

465
00:25:24,527 --> 00:25:27,462
I also wanted to apologize
about the dentist.

It's-

467

you've had, uh, s- so many unique theories.

Randy, I checked Dr. Bloom out myself on my own time.

He's got no priors.
He's never been in trouble.

00:33:41,702 --> 00:33:43,863
But you were wrong.

598
00:33:43,937 --> 00:33:45,871
He did remember.

599
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,341
Or maybe when
the money went missing,

600
00:33:50,411 --> 00:33:52,538
he just figured it out.

601
00:33:54,314 --> 00:33:58,751
<i>He came back here Tuesday night</i>
<i>when you were working on Randy.</i>

602
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:07,016
Randy witnessed
the whole thing, sort of.

603
00:34:07,094 --> 00:34:09,562
He was right
about everything.

604
00:34:10,697 --> 00:34:12,665
Wasn't he?

605
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:14,758
If you say so.

606
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:17,860
Hello again, Mr. Monk.

607
00:34:20,674 --> 00:34:25,111
Is it true that you've only
been to the dentist once before? Yeah.

608
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:28,148
I gather it wasn't
a good experience.

609
00:34:28,215 --> 00:34:29,807
Oh, this will be much worse.

610
00:34:30,884 --> 00:34:34,183
I'm-
I'm a police officer.

611
00:34:34,254 --> 00:34:37,189
Oh, I know that.
That's precisely why you're here.

612
00:34:37,257 --> 00:34:41,284
See, Terri and I,
we have some merchandise that we'd like to sell.

613
00:34:41,361 --> 00:34:43,488
Open, open, open.

614
00:34:43,564 --> 00:34:45,555
Some bank certificates.

615
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:50,262
Now, there's a man
in Chicago named Mr. Cronin who would like to buy them,

616
00:34:50,337 --> 00:34:54,967
but we're afraid of approaching him
because we don't know if he's being watched by the police.

617
00:34:55,042 --> 00:34:57,306
Now, my question is...

618
00:34:57,377 --> 00:34:59,368
is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?

619
00:35:02,816 --> 00:35:04,807
I don't know.

620
00:35:10,457 --> 00:35:13,221
Have you ever seen the movie
<i>Marathon Man</i>, Mr. Monk?

621
00:35:13,293 --> 00:35:17,889
No. Is it good?
Let's watch. Let's- Let's watch it now.

622
00:35:17,965 --> 00:35:21,457
I'm not much of a movie guy,

623
00:35:21,535 --> 00:35:24,163
but I have some time now.

624
00:35:24,238 --> 00:35:27,298
Who's in it?
Who's in that?

625
00:35:27,374 --> 00:35:29,740
You're not gonna <i>watch</i> it.

626
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:32,506
You're gonna live it.

627
00:35:34,848 --> 00:35:37,316
Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?
Yes or no?

628
00:35:37,384 --> 00:35:39,318
I don't know.

629
00:35:39,386 --> 00:35:41,320
I wish I did. L- l-

630
00:35:41,388 --> 00:35:45,085
I really wish I did.
I wish I did.

631
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,492
- Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?
- No!

632
00:35:48,562 --> 00:35:50,496
[Sobbing]

633
00:35:50,564 --> 00:35:53,829
Is he under surveillance?
Yes. Okay. Yes.

634
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,835
Yes.

635
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:58,701
We know-We know all about him.

636
00:35:58,772 --> 00:36:01,502
You-You have to be careful.

637
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:03,566
You should be careful.

638
00:36:03,644 --> 00:36:06,272
Now I really wish I could
believe you, Mr. Monk. [Screams]

Your teeth are perfect.

641
00:36:11,018 --> 00:36:13,953
I don't see a single cavity.

642
00:36:14,021 --> 00:36:15,955
[Whimpers]

643
00:36:16,023 --> 00:36:19,288
Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?

644
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,692
[Whimpers, Mumbles]

645
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,697
He's not saying anything.

646
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,359
Pass me the extractor, please.

[Pinball Machine Dings]

648
00:36:33,273 --> 00:36:35,935
I still don't see what's wrong
with the Randy Disher Project.

649
00:36:36,009 --> 00:36:39,945
I never liked that name.
Even in high school.

650
00:36:40,013 --> 00:36:42,538
[Exhales]
Okay.

651
00:36:45,285 --> 00:36:48,982
Okay. What about
the Randy Disher Experience?

652
00:36:49,056 --> 00:36:51,217
How about Severe Tire Damage?

653
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:54,954
Okay. How about Mellow Knights
with a "K"?

654
00:36:58,165 --> 00:37:01,601
I gotta say I'm leaning towards
the Randy Disher Experience. <i>How about this?</i>

655
00:37:01,668 --> 00:37:04,193
I'm gonna open up a newspaper...

656
00:37:04,271 --> 00:37:07,138
and the first word I see,

657
00:37:07,207 --> 00:37:09,141
that's our name.

658
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:11,143
Baghdad.

659
00:37:11,211 --> 00:37:14,510
That's good, actually.
I kinda like that. <i>Baghdad.</i>

660
00:37:14,581 --> 00:37:16,845
Let me see that.

661
00:37:19,486 --> 00:37:21,750
"13 million in bearer bonds stolen."

662
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:24,880
Bearer bonds. Barry Bonds.

663
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:28,985
Not Barry Bonds.
They were saying "bearer bonds."

664
00:37:29,062 --> 00:37:33,522
Wait! Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

665
00:37:35,168 --> 00:37:39,298
Your hands are so dirty.

666
00:37:39,373 --> 00:37:41,739
- Excuse me?
- Could you-

667
00:37:41,808 --> 00:37:44,470
You gotta wash your hands first.

668
00:37:44,544 --> 00:37:46,876
Please. Please.

669
00:37:47,914 --> 00:37:50,474
You want me to wash my hands.
Please.

670
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,142
I'm not gonna wash my hands,
okay? Please.

671
00:37:52,219 --> 00:37:55,382
I'm not washing my hands!
Okay, just hold still. The sink's right over there.

672
00:37:55,455 --> 00:37:58,686
We're not animals here, right?
Please, I'm asking you.

673
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:02,286
- I'm asking you!
- He did wash his hands in <i>Marathon Man.</i>

674
00:38:02,362 --> 00:38:05,229
Don't give me "In <i>Marathon Man."</i>
I'm not gonna wash my hands when I'm torturing him.

675
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:08,735
It'll just take one second.
Please. I'm asking you!

676
00:38:08,802 --> 00:38:11,896
Look into your heart.
For the love of God,

677
00:38:11,972 --> 00:38:14,406
by all that's holy,
look into your heart.

678
00:38:14,474 --> 00:38:17,170
Look into your heart.
I'll wash my damn hands, okay?

Look, the lights are on.

00:38:30,824 --> 00:38:33,816
No! That's the wrong soap.

682
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,761
You gotta use
antibacterial soap.

683
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,764
Give me the drill.
Gotta use the right soap.

00:38:38,832 --> 00:38:41,926
- This is enough already.
Just give me the drill. - Not that soap!
