[Man #2]
That's a first, huh?

2
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,241
Wanna grab some coffee?

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:12,938
No. I gotta get home.
We're meeting the wedding planner.

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,947
I thought
that was last night.

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,950
No, last night was the caterer.
Should have taken my advice.

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,952
Should have just eloped.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,750
Well, it's too late now.
No, it's not, man.
You can do it.

8
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:26,758
Hop on a plane tonight.
Go to Vegas.
Boom. It's all over.

9
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:30,887
Rachel's mom
would never speak to me again.

10
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,898
That's the best argument
to do it.

11
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,560
I been trying to get
my mother-in-law to shut up
for five years.

12
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:38,365
- Whoa, what's this?
- What the hell are they doing?

13
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:44,967
Hit the brakes!
I'm trying!

14
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,275
Try the emergency brake!
This is Baker Four.

15
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,815
We're on Vinton and Hillside.
It's a hijacking.

believe that.

Is that important?

on the floor.

83
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,447
Any ideas about the robbery?

84
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,014
Did you notice the back bumper,
how damaged it was?
Yeah.

85

These side mirrors are pushed in.

86
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,857
I don't think this armored car
was driven here.

87
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,226
It wasn't?
No.

88
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:36,208
I think it was carried somehow
in the back of a bigger truck.

89
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,767
You can see the tire tracks
from a larger vehicle.

90

You're right.

91
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,374
It was probably an 18-wheeler
about 14 feet wide.

92
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,953
So they brought
the armored car here,
they unload it.

93
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,891
How did they get the drivers
out of the cab?

Piece of rubber tubing.

in the Plexiglas.

about it all week.

you lied to me like that.

"I have a toothache"?
- I did, like 10 times.

104
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:35,167
Randy, if you don't take care
of this tooth immediately, today,

105
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,828
I'm gonna rip it out myself.
You understand?

106
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,838
Fine.

107
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,265

Oh. Our nighttime receptionist quit.

115

kidnapped Barry Bonds.

That's true.
But dentists are in a separate category
all together. Okay?

I don't get a cavity.
I don't get cavities.

271
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,130
I brush my teeth 12 times a day
and I floss every 90 minutes.

272
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,398
So you've never been to a dentist.
Once. When I was 12.

- Not well.

There's no drilling.

Psst. Mr. Monk.

285

Pretty sure...

286
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,578
this is how the Nazis
decorated their bunkers.

287

Don't look at that.
Look-Look-Look down.

288
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,386
Look at the carpet.
What a beautiful carpet.

289
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,424
It is a beautiful carpet.
Right? Is that better?

290
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,426
It is better.

<i>said a lot of patients do.</i>

592
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:23,534
<i>He told you everything,</i>
<i>about the robbery,</i>
<i>where they hid the money.</i>

593
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:28,231
- It must have been like
winning the lottery.
- If you say so.

594
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:31,207
<i>That night,</i>
<i>you went toJardeen's house,</i>

595

<i>f</i>i<i>gured it was safe,</i>

596
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:36,613
<i>that he would never remember</i>
<i>telling you anything.</i>

597
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,842
But you were wrong.

598
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,850
He did remember.

599
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,320
Or maybe when
the money went missing,

600
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,517
he just figured it out.

601
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:53,730
<i>He came back here Tuesday night</i>
<i>when you were working on Randy.</i>

602
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,995
Randy witnessed
the whole thing, sort of.

603
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,541
He was right
about everything.

604
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,644
Wasn't he?

605
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,737
If you say so.

606
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,839
Hello again, Mr. Monk.

607
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:20,090
Is it true that you've only
been to the dentist once before?
Yeah.

608
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:23,127
I gather it wasn't
a good experience.

609
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,786
Oh, this will be much worse.

610
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:29,162
I'm...
I'm a police officer.

611
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,168
Oh, I know that.
That's precisely why you're here.

612
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:36,263
See, Terri and I,
we have some merchandise
that we'd like to sell.

613
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,467
Open, open, open.

614
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,534
Some bank certificates.

615
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:45,241
Now, there's a man
in Chicago named Mr. Cronin
who would like to buy them,

616
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:49,946
but we're afraid of approaching him
because we don't know if he's
being watched by the police.

617
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,285
Now, my question is...

618
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,347
is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?

619
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,786
I don't know.

620
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,200
Have you ever seen the movie
<i>Marathon Man</i>, Mr. Monk?

621
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:12,868
No. Is it good?
Let's watch.
Let's... Let's watch it now.

622
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,436
I'm not much of a movie guy,

623
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,142
but I have some time now.

624
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:22,277
Who's in it?
Who's in that?

625
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:24,719
You're not gonna <i>watch</i> it.

626
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,485
You're gonna live it.

627
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,295
Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?
Yes or no?

628
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,297
I don't know.

629
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,299
I wish I did. L... l...

630
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:40,064
I really wish I did.
I wish I did.

631
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,471
- Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?
- No!

632
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,475
[Sobbing]

633
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:48,808
Is he under surveillance?
Yes. Okay. Yes.

634
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,814
Yes.

635
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,680
We know... We know all about him.

636
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,481
You... You have to be careful.

637
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,545
You should be careful.

638
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,251
Now I really wish I could
believe you, Mr. Monk.

00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:34,924
I never liked that name.
Even in high school.

[Exhales]
Okay.

651
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:43,961
Okay. What about
the Randy Disher Experience?

652
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,196
How about Severe Tire Damage?

653
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:49,933
Okay. How about Mellow Knights
with a "K"?

654
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:56,580
I gotta say I'm leaning towards
the Randy Disher Experience.
<i>How about this?</i>

655
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:59,172
I'm gonna open up a newspaper...

00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,117
and the first word I see,

657
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:04,120
that's our name.

658
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,122
Baghdad.

That's good, actually.
I kinda like that.

"13 million in bearer bonds stolen."

662
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,859
Bearer bonds. Barry Bonds.

663
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,964
Not Barry Bonds.
They were saying "bearer bonds."

- Excuse me?
- Could you...

667
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,449
You gotta wash your hands first.

668
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,855
Please. Please.

669
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:45,453
You want me to wash my hands.
Please.

I'm not gonna wash my hands,
okay?
Please.

Okay, just hold still.

Please, I'm asking you.

- He did wash his hands
in <i>Marathon Man.</i>

Don't give me "In <i>Marathon Man. '"</i>
I'm not gonna wash my hands
when I'm torturing him.

675
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,714
It'll just take one second.
Please. I'm asking you!

Look into your heart.
For the love of God,

look into your heart.

No! That's the wrong soap.

You gotta use

Give me the drill.
Gotta use the right soap.
