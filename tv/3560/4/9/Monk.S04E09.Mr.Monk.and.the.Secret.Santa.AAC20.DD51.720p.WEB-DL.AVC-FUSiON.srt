00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:41,055
Why don't you give him one of
these toys from your desk?

152
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:44,723
No, he's been in this office
a million times. He'll know I recycled it.

153
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,323
But what about-

154
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:49,562
Does he like port?

155
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,570
I think so.

Oh, I love it.

Excellent!
All right. Hey!

00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,255
Thanks, Captain.
Good deal.

- What happened?

170
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,902
What'd he say?
It's still preliminary.

171
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,803
What did he say, Randy?
Poison.

172
00:14:35,873 --> 00:14:38,273
Some kind of strychnine.
Simple and effective.

173
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:40,936
- Anybody could have made it.
- Couldn't he have tasted it?

174
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:44,277
- Port's a pretty heavy drink, isn't it?
- It's really strong.

175
00:14:44,348 --> 00:14:49,285
He wouldn't taste it in that.
Captain, they need the body.

176
00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:51,287
Yeah.

177
00:14:56,127 --> 00:15:00,325
This was meant for me.
There but for the grace of God.

"The grace of God."

Captain, I'm really so sorry.

181
00:15:14,345 --> 00:15:16,279
He was only 38 years old, right?

182
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:18,508
Was he married?
No, I think they were separated.

183
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:22,679
No. They're back together.
I just talked toJenny.

184
00:15:22,753 --> 00:15:24,846
They got two little girls.
Twins.

Is this the card
that came with the bottle? <i>Yeah.</i>

186
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:33,593
Nobody saw who delivered it?

187
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:36,497
It was sitting at the front desk.
Anybody could have dropped it off there.

188
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:40,196
I'm so sorry.
It was my idea for the gift exchange, the Secret Santa.

- Alice, you can't blame yourself.
- Well, I just woke upJohn DeSilva.

190
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:47,969
He owns the body shop.
He says they never send gifts or liquor.

191
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:51,344
He offered
to come down and take a poly, but it feels like a dead end.

192
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:53,474
Whoever sent it knew
you did business with them.

193

<i>That narrows it down, right?</i>
Mmm.

Anybody could have seen it.

196
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:04,819
Okay, let's get to it.
I've, uh, narrowed it down to five possible suspects.

197
00:16:04,895 --> 00:16:07,193
<i>People who may have had a grudge,</i>
<i>people you arrested</i>-

198
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:11,325
- It was Frank Prager.
- Yes, sir. Frank's on the list.

199
00:16:11,402 --> 00:16:14,030
He's number one.
Who's Prager?

200
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:17,734
Ayear ago,
the captain shot and killed a bank robber named Mike Prager.

201
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:21,244
Frank's his brother.
A few months ago, he tried to settle the score.

202
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:23,576
He came at me in a parking lot.

203
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:26,242
He got off five rounds,
and he missed.

204
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:29,912
- He got away.
- Disappeared. And it looks like he missed again.

205
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:35,015
- All right. Why don't we each take a name?
- Lieutenant, you're wasting your time. I'm telling you, it's Frank Prager.

206
00:16:35,092 --> 00:16:37,424
All right.
How about this?

207
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:40,396
How about we split up into two teams?
Your team gets Prager.

208
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:43,695
My team will take the rest of the list.

209
00:16:43,768 --> 00:16:46,760
Okay. Hmm.
Let's see.

210
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:50,564
What are you doing?
I'm picking my team.

211
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:54,668
<i>I'll take, uh</i>- <i>I'll take Monk.</i>

212
00:16:57,014 --> 00:16:59,414
No, I'll take Monk.

213
00:16:59,483 --> 00:17:02,077
<i>Okay, uh, I'll take Natalie.</i>

214
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:04,587
Oh, I can't.
Julie's waiting for me at home.

215
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:09,024
<i>Fine. Um, I'll take, uh</i>-

216
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:14,221
You'll take Robbins.
Meet us back here at noon.

217
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:21,466
I'll take Robbins.
Let's go.

218
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:28,137
Four months ago-
It was a Tuesday night.

219
00:17:28,212 --> 00:17:32,205
I came out of the bar, 2:00 a.m.

220
00:17:33,884 --> 00:17:37,479
<i>They took my keys,</i>
<i>so I'm walking home.</i>

221
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:40,888
<i>I was alone.</i>
<i>I was pretty toasted.</i>

222
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,222
<i>And that streetlight was on,</i>
<i>'cause I could still see.</i>

223
00:17:44,862 --> 00:17:47,797
And he was waiting.
He was by-

224
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:53,269
There was a big, black van here.
He was waiting behind it. Uh, must have been here all night.

225
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:57,996
<i>He steps out. I'm standing</i>
<i>right about where you are now.</i>

226
00:17:58,075 --> 00:18:02,341
<i>I knew who it was right away.</i>
<i>It was Frank Prager,</i> <i>and he wanted me dead.</i>

227
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:04,677
<i>I could see it in his eyes.</i>

228
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:08,845
<i>He aims a Glock 17 at my head,</i>
<i>caps off five rounds,</i>

229
00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:13,557
<i>and then</i>-

230
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,951
Then he disappeared.

231
00:18:18,028 --> 00:18:20,553
Until last night.

232
00:18:20,631 --> 00:18:23,429
He was only 12 feet away
with a streetlight behind him.

233
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:25,435
It's not a hard shot.

234
00:18:25,503 --> 00:18:28,028
You said he was a veteran,
special ops? Yeah.

235
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:30,164
Maybe he was as toasted as me.

236
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:34,875
Or maybe it was a miracle.
Maybe it was.

237
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:40,173
And they just left
the bullet holes there.

238
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:43,709
Well, it's probably good
for business at this place.

239
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:48,316
It adds to the mystique.
But this pattern does not look random.

240
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:51,623
Two, one, two.
He had a Glock 17.

241
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:54,721
He could have fired 20 rounds.
He only squeezed off five?

242
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,200
Two, one, two.
Monk, it doesn't matter.

243
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:01,238
He's given up on guns.
The guy's graduated to strychnine.

244
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:03,330
It's a different M.O.
He's special ops, remember?

245
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:05,841
Those guys know a hundred different ways
to kill somebody.

246
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,401
Look, Prager wants me dead.

247
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:11,414
I'm the guy that shot his brother.

248
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:15,976
He's married, right,
with a daughter? Yeah. Cute kid, seven years old.

249
00:19:16,053 --> 00:19:19,181
Is he in touch with them?
Well, we staked out the house for a couple of weeks,

250
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:21,884
but he never called
or showed his face.

251
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,291
Well, let's check it out.
Maybe he's home for Christmas.

252
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:26,522
Monk, l-l-I can't go
near the place.

253
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:30,931
The, uh, wife filed a complaint against me,
said that I had been harassing her.

254
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:35,665
Why would she say that?
Uh, probably because I've been harassing her.

255
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:42,041
What?
She's never seen you.

256
00:19:53,991 --> 00:19:57,324
[Sighs]
God, how much longer?

257
00:19:57,394 --> 00:20:00,454
Natalie, this is a stakeout.
You never know how long.

258
00:20:00,531 --> 00:20:03,523
That's what makes a stakeout
so much fun.

259
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:11,201
Oh, you wanna play 20 questions?

260
00:20:11,275 --> 00:20:13,436
Sure.
Okay. All right. You can go first.

261
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:17,071
You have to think of somebody,
anybody, living or dead.

262
00:20:18,282 --> 00:20:21,308
Okay, I've got it.
Uh-

263
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:25,784
Is it Trudy?

264
00:20:25,856 --> 00:20:27,847
Trudy who?
Trudy Monk. Your wife!

265
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:30,052
Yes.
Thank you.

266
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:32,118
That was fun.

267
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:38,933
So, Mr. Monk,
what do you want for Christmas?

268
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:43,201
A miracle.
Yeah? I could use one of those.

269
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:46,835
Julie hates it here
because it never snows.

270
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:49,402
She's been praying
for this white Christmas.

271
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,641
It hasn't snowed in San Francisco
in nine years.

272
00:20:51,715 --> 00:20:54,980
The last time it snowed
was the day Trudy died.

273
00:20:55,052 --> 00:20:56,986
Hmm.

274
00:20:59,857 --> 00:21:04,191
Oh, my God! I can't stand it. Let's just
go up there and knock on the door. And say what?

00:21:45,102 --> 00:21:48,071
We get carolers all the time.
Usually there's a whole group.

284
00:21:48,138 --> 00:21:51,733
Right. We started with a big crowd.
We had a group. A big group.

285
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:54,471
Bob, Paul, Sue-
Big crowd. And, um, we had, um-

286
00:21:54,545 --> 00:21:56,479
But then we lost
them somehow. Yeah.

287
00:21:56,547 --> 00:21:58,640

They just- Yeah, they just left.

- What-What happened?
- Creative differences.

289
00:22:01,986 --> 00:22:04,580
They really weren't comfortable
with religious material.

290
00:22:04,655 --> 00:22:08,091
Just wanted to do a whole,
whole different thing. Like a Vegas style.

- In a way.

00:22:42,026 --> 00:22:46,622
- Shh. It's a secret.

That went well.

Okay, hold on. Hold on.
Do we have a plan? Well, no.

307
00:23:23,534 --> 00:23:26,765
I need to talk to the little girl again,
just for a minute.

308
00:23:26,837 --> 00:23:30,500
She knows something.
I'm telling you. Who are all these people?

309
00:23:30,574 --> 00:23:32,974
These folks have forgotten
the true meaning of Christmas.

310
00:23:33,043 --> 00:23:35,568
Yeah, which is what?
Which is leaving me alone.

311
00:23:35,646 --> 00:23:39,241
Well, I love it.
I love everything about it. The crowds, the shopping, the decorations.

312
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:42,615
And the fact that it's horrible
doesn't bother you?

313
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,191
Oh, my gosh!
I can't believe he's still here.

Wait a minute.
How many jobs have you had? It was just after high school.

316
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:09,311
It was a summer thing.
I worked at the information booth, but only lasted for three weeks.

317
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:11,677
What happened?
<i>Oh, Mr. Preston liked me a lot.</i>

318
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:15,206
A little too much.
Well, I've never had that problem.

Ooh.
[Laughs]

320
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:23,151
I'll be right back.
Where are you going?

321
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:28,187
- I'm gonna go find Mr. Preston.
He owes me a favor. - What kind of favor?

322
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,630

We have some new rules here
in Santa's workshop.

335
00:25:42,022 --> 00:25:44,650
Before anybody can sit on Santa's lap,

336
00:25:44,725 --> 00:25:49,389
you have to use these magic wipes
and wipe your hands.

Yeah! Wiping is fun!

And no touching Santa's face.

<i>And try not to breathe on Santa.</i>

<i>Remember, Santa isn't always jolly.</i>

341
00:26:00,975 --> 00:26:03,170
Sometimes Santa's a little bit sad.

342
00:26:03,244 --> 00:26:05,178
Okay? Who's first?

343
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:11,250
No, no, no. Just stand-
stand over there. Have you been a good boy?

344
00:26:14,922 --> 00:26:17,652
Have you?
He's got to sit on your lap. You're Santa Claus.

00:26:17,725 --> 00:26:20,387
I don't think so.
He has to sit on your lap. Here, jump up.

No, no, no.
Okay, th-th-that's too close. Yep! Get up!

Just a little further there. That's good.

a "nunny" quality. [Stammers]

Yes, ma'am, I do.
You obviously have very strong feelings about this.

Brad's not his name.
You're right.

407

but I know the man. He's been working in our outreach program.

00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:47,455
He's been feeding the hungry
and the homeless every night.

409
00:30:47,528 --> 00:30:51,487
When they're too tired to come here,
he brings the food to them. Maybe he has a guilty conscience.

410
00:30:51,565 --> 00:30:54,966
Well, any conscience at all
is a rare thing these days.

What do you want, Captain?

412
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:01,173
I want justice.

413
00:31:01,241 --> 00:31:04,677
Well, he's afraid that
you want something else.

414
00:31:04,745 --> 00:31:10,411
He's afraid you and the other
policemen want- Revenge.

415
00:31:10,484 --> 00:31:12,475
My father once taught me
an important lesson.

416

There is no revenge so complete
as forgiveness.

417
00:31:20,194 --> 00:31:23,288
Your father.
He's your father too.

418
00:31:28,168 --> 00:31:31,331
Okay, look, I promise you
that I will not hurt him.

00:31:31,405 --> 00:31:33,396
Okay.

420
00:31:35,576 --> 00:31:39,376
Frank, there is a clinic
next to the church.

421
00:31:41,515 --> 00:31:44,678
They have drugs.
They have chemicals.

422
00:31:44,751 --> 00:31:47,515
Did you have access
to the storage room?

423
00:31:47,588 --> 00:31:52,525
Um, I mean, I didn't have a key
or anything,

424
00:31:52,593 --> 00:31:55,653
but it would have been easy enough
to break in.

425
00:31:55,729 --> 00:31:58,391
I didn't poison anybody.
I'm not a killer.

426
00:31:58,465 --> 00:32:03,198
Oh, right. What about
our last date in the parking lot four months ago?

427
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:06,899
I wasn't trying to kill you.
You can't be serious.

428
00:32:06,974 --> 00:32:09,943
All right.
I thought about it.

429
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:14,674
When I got there, I couldn't.

430
00:32:14,748 --> 00:32:19,947
I didn't wanna become my brother.
At the last minute, I decided to send you a message.

00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,717
A message.
Oh, my God.

432

<i>Captain, the pattern was an "M."</i>
<i>"M"for Michael.</i>

<i>How could you miss it?</i>

434
00:32:35,435 --> 00:32:40,168
Oh, well, how was I supposed to know
that was the letter "M"?

like everybody else?

Oh, for God's sake.

Wait. You think I
don't think about your brother?

442
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:09,625
I think about your brother
every damn day of my life.

443
00:33:09,703 --> 00:33:14,231
It was him or me,
and it still eats me up.

444
00:33:14,308 --> 00:33:19,905
I don't need an "M" on a wall
to remember something like that.

No cop does.

446
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,978
Get him outta here.

00:33:28,055 --> 00:33:29,989
[Man]
Let's go.

448
00:33:30,057 --> 00:33:34,016
[Sighs] God, Captain,
you gotta read this.

449
00:33:34,094 --> 00:33:36,619
This is from the journal he kept
while he was in that church.

450
00:33:36,697 --> 00:33:39,291
He feels terrible about what he did.
Look at this one part.

451
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:41,357
It made me cry.
He can't see it.

452
00:33:41,435 --> 00:33:44,529
<i>Yeah</i>- <i>No, I know, Natalie.</i>
<i>He's not the guy, all right?</i>

453
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:48,837
Okay, moving on. Lieutenant,
you said there were four other suspects who might have had a motive.

454
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:51,173
Actually, we struck out.

455
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:56,079
One's deceased, one's in the hospital,
and, uh, two are back in prison.

456
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:59,243
Okay, so it wasn't Frank Prager.
It's nobody on your list.

457
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:03,187
- Who sent me that bottle of wine?
- And will they try again?

458
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:08,287
- To kill you, I mean.
- I know what you mean, Lieutenant.

459
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:16,701
Mmm.
Mom.

460
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,500
What?
[Laughing]

461
00:34:19,573 --> 00:34:21,666
<i>No, look. See?</i>
<i>It looks good.</i>

462
00:34:21,742 --> 00:34:24,176
[Laughing]
Okay. And you need one too.

463
00:34:24,244 --> 00:34:27,213
Oh, okay.
I'll set it right there.

464
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,684
<i>Okay, okay. And this</i>-
<i>[Laughs]</i> <i>Is from Mr. Monk.</i>

465
00:34:32,753 --> 00:34:36,154
You didn't have to
get me anything. But thanks.

466
00:34:36,223 --> 00:34:38,157
Don't tear- Mmm.
[Mutters]

467
00:34:40,227 --> 00:34:43,856
- A first-aid kit.
- That is the hot gift this year.

468
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:46,330
It's the Cadillac of first-aid kits.

469
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,667
<i>I'm talking about 100 feet of gauze,</i>
<i>five different ointments and a tourniquet.</i>

470
00:34:51,738 --> 00:34:54,434
Now, that tourniquet-
That's great. We're gonna look at that later.

471
00:34:54,508 --> 00:34:58,000
Because this is from both of us.

472
00:34:58,078 --> 00:35:00,012
Careful, though. It's fragile.

473
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,777
Oh. Oh, no.

474
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,784
Oh.

475
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:16,126
It's alive. It's a living thing.
Is it gonna die?

476
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:19,688
Well, not for a long, long,
long time.

477
00:35:19,766 --> 00:35:22,132
- But it will die eventually.
- It's a friend!

478
00:35:22,202 --> 00:35:24,693
A friend who'll die.
It's a little friend to keep you company.

479
00:35:24,771 --> 00:35:27,569
A dying friend.
Look. Look at it. It's just twitching.

480
00:35:27,641 --> 00:35:29,609
It's turning left,
then it swims right.

481
00:35:29,676 --> 00:35:31,610
It's zigzagging!
Can't we train it?

482
00:35:31,678 --> 00:35:34,306
Yeah, we can train it
to swim clockwise.

483
00:35:34,381 --> 00:35:38,442
- And I can show you
how to feed this. Oh. - Oh. Okay, wait. Stay there.

484
00:35:38,518 --> 00:35:41,681
It's okay.
I'll get it. With my new broom.

485
00:35:41,755 --> 00:35:44,280
Just wait.

486
00:35:44,357 --> 00:35:47,383
<i>[Laughing]</i>
<i>Okay, let's see it.</i>

00:35:47,461 --> 00:35:50,021
<i>[Chattering]</i>
<i>Oh.!</i>

488
00:35:50,097 --> 00:35:53,089
<i>That's adorable.</i>
<i>[Chattering Continues]</i>

489
00:35:56,436 --> 00:35:59,633
<i>Think it'll fit you?</i>
<i>I think it will.</i>

490
00:36:00,674 --> 00:36:02,608
<i>[Knocking]</i>

491
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:06,845
Captain.
<i>[Stottlemeyer]</i> <i>Merry Christmas, Alice.</i>

492
00:36:08,048 --> 00:36:09,982
May we come in?

493
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,143
<i>[Alice]</i>
<i>So what's going on?</i>

494
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:17,919
Uh, Monk thinks that he knows
who tried to kill me, uh, during the Christmas party.

495
00:36:17,991 --> 00:36:21,427
I thought it was Frank Prager.
No, it wasn't Prager.

496
00:36:21,495 --> 00:36:24,259
- In fact, it wasn't anybody.
- Nobody tried to kill the captain.

497
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:27,767
That was a trick
to throw us off track.

498
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:30,632
Terry Chasen was the target
from the beginning.

499
00:36:30,704 --> 00:36:35,198
<i>Alice, we know you</i>
<i>and Terry were involved.</i> <i>We've got phone records, credit cards.</i>

500
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:38,335
<i>You were together</i>
<i>for about six months.</i> Seven.

501
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:43,110
- Seven months.
- Was it because he went back to his wife? That's why you killed him?

502
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:49,381
Alice, we know how you did it.

503
00:36:50,724 --> 00:36:53,557
<i>The Christmas gift exchange</i>
<i>was your idea.</i>

504
00:36:53,627 --> 00:36:56,118
<i>It was easy to make sure that</i>
<i>the captain picked Terry's name.</i>

505
00:36:56,196 --> 00:37:00,633
<i>[Stottlemeyer] Yeah, I remember.</i>
<i>I was the last one to choose,</i> <i>and there was one name left.</i>

506
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,931
<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>The day of the party, you brought</i> <i>a poisoned bottle into the office.</i>

507
00:37:04,004 --> 00:37:07,405
<i>You dropped it off at the front desk.</i>
<i>It was addressed to Captain Stottlemeyer.</i>

508
00:37:07,474 --> 00:37:10,705
<i>[Stottlemeyer]</i>
<i>And you know I don't drink port.</i>

509
00:37:10,777 --> 00:37:13,337
<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>And at some point,</i> <i>probably during the party,</i>

510
00:37:13,413 --> 00:37:18,009
<i>you snuck into the captain's office,</i>
<i>and you stole the gift</i> <i>that he had brought in for Terry.</i>

511
00:37:18,084 --> 00:37:22,487
<i>[Natalie]</i>
<i>When the captain couldn't find it,</i> <i>you suggested replacing it with the bottle.</i>

512
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:25,719
<i>The poisoned bottle.</i>
<i>[Monk] It was like a magician</i> <i>doing a sleight ofhand.</i>

513
00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:28,886
<i>You had everybody</i>
<i>looking the wrong way.</i>

514
00:37:28,962 --> 00:37:31,988
It was... brilliant.

Excuse me.

Alice.

518
00:37:52,252 --> 00:37:55,346
Alice, where is the poison?

519
00:37:56,423 --> 00:38:00,416
<i>You know, if you threw it away,</i>
<i>we'll find traces of it.</i> <i>You know that.</i>

520
00:38:04,431 --> 00:38:06,422
It's in the basement.

521
00:38:09,436 --> 00:38:12,269
How did you know?
Natalie.

522
00:38:15,742 --> 00:38:20,372
This is the card and the envelope
that came with the whisk broom.

523
00:38:20,447 --> 00:38:22,938
Which, by the way,
I've been using. It really is fantastic.

524
00:38:23,016 --> 00:38:25,780
But the card is a little too big. See?

525
00:38:25,852 --> 00:38:28,116
You had to fold it over.

526
00:38:29,222 --> 00:38:32,385
This card came
with the poisoned bottle.

527
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:35,451
It's too small.

528
00:38:35,528 --> 00:38:39,089
- Alice, you mixed them up.
- I mixed them up.

529
00:38:41,434 --> 00:38:43,959
And I'm usually so organized.

530
00:38:49,843 --> 00:38:51,834
I couldn't.

531
00:38:54,547 --> 00:38:57,448
I just couldn't live without him.

532
00:38:57,517 --> 00:38:59,451

533
00:39:15,235 --> 00:39:17,829
I got him. Thanks.

00:39:20,006 --> 00:39:22,474
I talked to the D.A.
She's gonna offer you a deal.

535
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:24,635
Eight months, plus time served
on the assault.

536
00:39:27,981 --> 00:39:31,007
Think about it.

537
00:39:31,084 --> 00:39:33,848
And you can decide
when you get back.

538
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,582
Where am I going?

539
00:39:36,656 --> 00:39:39,250
You are released
on your own recognizance for two days.

540
00:39:39,326 --> 00:39:44,025
Now, I am responsible for you,
so don't make me regret it.

541
00:39:53,773 --> 00:39:56,606
