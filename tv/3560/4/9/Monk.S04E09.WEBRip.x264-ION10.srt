This is a bribe.

I'll be right back, okay?

Hey! Merry Christmas!

168
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:17,598
You two cousins?

169
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:21,969
Where'd you get that?

170
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,805
Wal-Mart.
Fifteen bucks.

171
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,611
My Aunt Kay probably went to
Wal-Mart and saw that sweater

172
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,713
and went home and
knitted me the same one.

173
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,715
That sweater inspired
this one.

174
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,750
You can still see
where she tore the tag off.

175
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:38,285
It's the thought that counts.

00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,163
Merry Christmas.

179
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,603
I haven't seen you
around lately.

180
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:58,238
I don't go out much
during the holidays.

181
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,040
It's so depressing.

182
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,909
Because I'm alone.

183
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,110
I don't have to tell you.

184
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,012
I mean,
you're not married, right?

185
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,280
You don't have anyone.

186
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:09,282
That's true.

187
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:11,118
It's tough.

188
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:14,622
Especially for people our age.

No, he's been in this office

It's really strong.

285
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,217
He wouldn't taste it
in that.

Nobody saw
who delivered it.

He says they never
send gifts or liquor.

311
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,982
He offered to come down
and take a poly,

a dead end.

Whoever sent it

314
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,119
knew you did business
with them.

A few months ago,
he tried to settle the score.

He came at me
in a parking lot.

332
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:25,118
He got off five rounds
and he missed.

333
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,353
He got away.
Disappeared.

334
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,421
And it looks like
he missed again.

335
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,523
All right, why don't we each
take a name?

336
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,125
Lieutenant, you're
wasting your time.

337
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,593
I'm telling you,
it's Frank Prager.

338
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,128
All right,
how about this?

339
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:38,365
How about we split up
into two teams?

340
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:39,532
Your team gets Prager.

341
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:42,369
My team'll take
the rest of the list.

342
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:47,140
Okay, mmm, let's see...

343
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:48,141
What are you doing?

344
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:49,276
I'm picking my team.

345
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,479
I'll take uh...

346
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,513
I'll take Monk.

347
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:57,584
No, I'll take Monk.

348
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:00,587
Okay, uh,
I'll take Natalie.

349
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,122
Oh, I can't.

350
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,290
Julie's waiting for me
at home.

351
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,159
Fine.

352
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:09,262
Um, I'll take, uh...

353
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:10,797
You'll take Robbins.

354
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,765
Meet us back here
at noon.

355
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,139
I'll take Robbins.

356
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:20,173
Let's go.

357
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,746
Four months ago,
it was a Tuesday night,

358
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,582
I came out of the bar...

359
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:30,817
2:00 a.m.

360
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,523
They took my keys,
so I'm walking home.

361
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,091
I was alone.

362
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,127
I was pretty toasted.

363
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,595
And that streetlight was on,
'cause I could still see.

364
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,797
And he was waiting.

365
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,599
He was...

366
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:47,700
There was
a big black van here.

367
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,103
He was waiting behind it.

368
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:51,871
Uh, must have been here
all night.

369
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,607
He steps out.

370
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:56,576
But I'm standing
right where you are now.

371
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:01,148
I knew who it was.
He wanted me dead.

372
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,515
I could see it
in his eyes.

373
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:05,318
He's got a Glock 17.

374
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:16,463
And then he disappeared.

375
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:17,564
Until last night.

376
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:20,900
He was only
12 feet away.

377
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,636
The streetlight behind him
is not a hard shot.

378
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,638
You said he was a veteran,
Special Ops?

379
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:26,639
Yeah.

380
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:28,675
Maybe he was
as toasted as me.

381
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,711
Maybe it was
a miracle.

382
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,580
Maybe it was.

383
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:39,219
And they just left
the bullet holes.

384
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:42,622
Well, it's probably
good for business

385
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,391
at this place.
It adds to the mystique.

386
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:47,660
This pattern
does not look random.

387
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:48,561
Two, one, two.

388
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,530
He had a Glock 17.

389
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:51,798
He could have fired
20 rounds.

390
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,634
He only squeezed off five?

391
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,635
Two, one, two.

392
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,270
Monk, it doesn't matter.

393
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:58,538
He's given up on guns.

394
00:18:58,571 --> 00:18:59,706
The guy's graduated
to Strychnine.

395
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,574
It's a different M.O.

396
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:02,575
He's Special Ops,
remember?

397
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:03,576
Those guys know
100 different ways

398
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,577
to kill someone.

399
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:07,680
Look, Prager
wants me dead.

400
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:10,517
I'm the guy
that shot his brother.

401
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,586
He's married, right?
With a daughter.

402
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,654
Yeah.
Cute kid, seven years old.

403
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,489
Is he in touch
with them?

404
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:17,857
Well, we staked out the house
for a couple of weeks,

405
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,559
but he never called
or showed his face.

406
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,494
Let's check it out.

407
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,829
Maybe--maybe he's home
for Christmas.

408
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:25,598
Monk, I can't go near
the place.

409
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:28,701
Yeah, the wife
filed a complaint

410
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,603
against me, said that I had
been harassing her.

411
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,472
Why would she
say that?

412
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,507
Uh, probably because
I've been harassing her.

413
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,578
What?

414
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,647
She's never seen you.

415
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,396
God, how much longer?

416
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:57,964
Natalie,
this is a stakeout.

417
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,599
You never know
how long.

418
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:03,670
That's what makes a stakeout
so much fun.

419
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:10,510
Oh, you wanna play
20 questions?

420
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,944
Sure.
Okay.

421
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:12,812
All right,
you can go first.

422
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,581
You have to think
of somebody, anybody,

423
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:17,484
living or dead.

424
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:19,852
Okay, yeah.

425
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:24,657
Is it Trudy?

426
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:25,658
Trudy who?

427
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,994
Trudy Monk, your wife!
Yes.

428
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,396
Thank you.

429
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:32,399
That was fun.

430
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:38,004
So, Mr. Monk, what do you want
for Christmas?

431
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,806
A miracle.

432
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,575
Yeah, I could use
one of those.

433
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:45,978
Julie hates it here
because it never snows.

434
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,881
She's been praying
for this white Christmas.

435
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,850
It hasn't snowed
in San Francisco in nine years.

436
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:55,822
The last time it snowed
was the day Trudy died.

437
00:20:58,658 --> 00:20:59,826
Oh, my God, I can't stand it!

438
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,894
Let's just go up there
and knock on the door!

439
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:02,929
And say what?

440
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:06,433
* Silent night

441
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:09,636
* Holy night

442
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:16,343
* All is calm
all is bright *

443
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:21,881
* Round yon virgin
mother and child *

444
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,816
It's dripping.
It's supposed to drip.

445
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:29,756
* Holy infant
so tender and mild *

446
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,957
* Sleep in

447
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:37,364
* Sleep in heavenly peace

448
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:40,767
* Sleep in heavenly peace

449
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,768
Ow.

450
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:42,802
[growling]

451
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:43,836
Merry Christmas.

452
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,738
We get carolers
all the time.

453
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:46,873
Usually there's
a whole group.

454
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,675
Right.
Yeah.

455
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,076
We had a group,
a big group.

456
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:52,479
Bob, Paul, Sue.
We started
with a big crowd.

457
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,680
And, um, we had, um...

458
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:55,682
But then
we lost them somehow.

459
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:57,484
And then
they just dropped out.

460
00:21:57,517 --> 00:21:58,485
Yeah, they just left.

461
00:21:58,518 --> 00:21:59,486
What happened?

462
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:01,053
Creative differences.

463
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:03,690
Really weren't comfortable
with religious material.

464
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:05,892
Just wanted to do
a whole different thing.

465
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:06,893
Like a Vegas style.

466
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,695
Just glittery?
No.

467
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:09,929
Not into it.

468
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:11,364
But we wished them well.

469
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:12,799
Can I use
your bathroom?

470
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,701
Yeah, sure.
Come on in.

471
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:28,448
Are you Dorrie?

472
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:31,684
How did you know?

473
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:34,654
Uh, well,
your daddy told me.

474
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:35,855
Do you know my daddy?

475
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,057
In a way.

476
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,826
Yeah, I've been
looking for him.

477
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:40,893
Do you know
where he is?

478
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,795
Ssh, it's a secret.

479
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:43,863
It's a secret?

480
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:45,398
Okay, I won't
tell anybody.

481
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:46,466
What are you doing?

482
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:47,867
I wa--um...

483
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,902
I was just...

484
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:50,970
Are you a cop?

485
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,739
Okay, look,
here's the thing.

486
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:53,840
Honey, go to
your room.

487
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:56,476
I want you out.

488
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:57,777
Just get out
of my house.

489
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,145
Haven't you people
done enough to this family?

490
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:20,166
Hold on, hold on.

491
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,668
Do we have a plan?

492
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,936
No, but I need to
talk to the little girl again.

493
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,004
Just for a minute.

494
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:26,639
She knows something,
I'm telling you.

495
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:28,775
Who are all these people?

496
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:29,942
I think these folks
have forgotten

497
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:31,611
the true meaning
of Christmas.

498
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:32,945
Yeah, which is what?

499
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:33,846
Which is
leaving me alone.

500
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,515
Oh, I love it.
I love everything about it.

501
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:37,717
The crowds, the shopping,
the decorations.

502
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,653
The fact that it's horrible
doesn't bother you?

503
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:55,067
Oh, my gosh!

504
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,135
I can't believe
he's still here!

505
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,837
Who's here?

506
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,039
Mr. Preston.
I used to work here.

507
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:02,241
Wait a minute, how many jobs
have you had?

508
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,810
Oh, it was just
after high school.

509
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:04,944
It was a summer thing.

510
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:06,112
I worked at
the information booth.

511
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,246
But it only lasted
for three weeks.

512
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,515
(Monk)
What happened?

513
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:09,816
Oh, Mr. Preston
liked me a lot.

514
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:11,784
A little too much.

515
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:13,152
Oh, I never had
that problem.

516
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,790
Ooh.

517
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:18,925
Ha ha ha.

518
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,126
I'll be right back.
Where are you going?

519
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,127
I'm gonna go find
Mr. Preston.

520
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,962
He owes me a favor.

521
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:26,165
What kind of favor?

522
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:34,974
Who's waiting
to see Santa Claus?

523
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:35,942
Yay!

524
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,043
Well, you're in luck.

525
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,945
Because guess
who just landed?

526
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,614
Straight from the North Pole?

527
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:42,982
Santa!

528
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:45,552
[giggling]

529
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,891
[all cheer]

530
00:24:56,996 --> 00:25:00,533
[kids all greet Santa]

531
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,988
Ho ho ho...

532
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,990
Yay!

533
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,124
Whoo!

534
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:34,801
Shhh.

535
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,268
Okay, everybody,
listen up, okay?

536
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:39,305
We have some new rules
here in Santa's Workshop.

537
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:42,041
Before anybody can sit
on Santa's lap,

538
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,711
you have to use
these magic wipes

539
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:46,312
and wipe your hands.

540
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:50,583
Yay!
Wiping is fun!

541
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:52,585
And no touching
Santa's face.

542
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:56,255
And try not to breathe
on Santa.

543
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,090
Remember, Santa
isn't always jolly.

544
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:00,660
Sometimes Santa's
a little bit sad.

545
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:02,261
Okay?
Who's first?

546
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:05,698
No no no no.

547
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,266
Just stand--stand over there.

548
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,567
Have you been
a good boy?

549
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:12,371
Have you?

550
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,906
Mr. Monk, he's got to sit
on your lap.

551
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,742
You're Santa Claus.
I don't think so.

552
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:16,809
He has to sit
on your lap.

553
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:18,210
Here, jump up!

554
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,278
No no no.
Yep!

555
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,747
Okay, that's too close!

556
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,781
All right, then,
on the knee.

557
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:23,349
The knee there.
A little further.

558
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,384
A little further.
Now he's squirming.

559
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,953
Santa doesn't like
the squirmers.

560
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:29,722
I love you, Santa.

561
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,391
What is she doing?

562
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,359
She wants a kiss.

563
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:35,094
Uh, no.

564
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:37,363
No, no, sorry, no good.
Next, you're done.

565
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:38,631
[child coughing]

566
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:40,633
Okay, that's it.
You're done.

567
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:41,300
Wait, but I made a list.

568
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,301
Yeah, good,
mail it to me.

569
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,402
Okay, you're done.

570
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,237
All I want for Christmas

571
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,338
is a rock polishing kit.

572
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:49,942
A rock polishing kit?

573
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,377
You're Santa's favorite.

574
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,378
What's your name?

575
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,612
Trudy.

576
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:02,354
Are you okay?

577
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:05,992
My wife's name
was Trudy.

578
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:07,359
She was killed
by a car bomb.

579
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:10,629
It was under
the passenger seat.

580
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,968
The whole car exploded.

581
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:24,811
Okay, you're done.

582
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:27,079
You're done.

583
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:29,148
Just go.

584
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:30,883
And what's your name?

585
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:33,119
Dorrie.
Dorrie.

586
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,420
That's a pretty name.

587
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:36,689
I bet I know
what you want for Christmas.

588
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:40,459
You want your daddy
to come home.

589
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,129
And I wanna help you
but I have a problem.

590
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,431
I just can't find him.

591
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:46,465
Do you know where he is?

592
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,700
In a church.

593
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:51,704
He lives in a church?

594
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:54,106
With the three ladies
out front.

595
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:58,344
Daddy!

596
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:06,385
Natalie...

597
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:07,987
Frank, they're cops!

598
00:29:06,813 --> 00:29:08,981
Monk was right,
he's in there.

599
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:11,183
Three ladies out front,
that's all we needed.

600
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:12,819
Yes, sir.

601
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:13,886
He's been living in there
since September...

602
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,354
in a room
in the basement.

603
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:16,488
He's going by the name
of Graham Elliot.

604
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:19,058
Look, I don't give a rat's ass
what he calls himself.

605
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,893
Let's go get him.
Cover the back.

606
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,394
Tell the snipers we're going in
on my signal.

607
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:23,796
Wait wait wait wait.

608
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,898
There's a nun in there.

609
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:28,868
She won't leave.

610
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:31,170
A nun?
She sounded nice.

611
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,806
I mean, she had
a nunny quality.

612
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,510
What does she want, Randy?

613
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:39,846
She just wants
to talk to you.

614
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:42,048
She's afraid you're gonna
rough him up.

615
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,223
Okay, hang on.

616
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:54,260
Stand down.

617
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,562
No, no, stay put.

618
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:57,596
Hold your positions.
Stand down.

619
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,098
Hold your positions.

620
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,042
Captain Stottlemeyer.
Yeah.

621
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:11,110
I'm Sister Heather.

622
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,079
Hi, Sister.

623
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:15,547
Uh, you know why
I'm here, right?

624
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:17,283
Yes.
He's here.

625
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,851
He's in the sanctuary.

626
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:20,920
He's very frightened.

627
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:22,889
You think he tried
to murder you?

628
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:25,557
Yes, Ma'am, I do.

629
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:28,127
You obviously have very strong
feelings about this.

630
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,196
Uh, you're God da--

631
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:31,563
Yes, I do.

632
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:34,233
I just wanna make sure
that Brad isn't mistreated.

633
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:36,602
Brad's not his name.
You're right.

634
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:38,871
I don't know
his real name.

635
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:40,539
But I know the man.

636
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,241
He's been working
in our outreach program.

637
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:43,375
He's been feeding the hungry
and the homeless

638
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:45,177
every night.

639
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:46,412
When they're too tired
to come here,

640
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:47,246
he brings the food
to them.

641
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,414
Well, maybe he has
a guilty conscience.

642
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:52,584
Well any conscience at all
is a rare thing these days.

643
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:54,320
What do you want, Captain?

644
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:58,457
I want justice.

645
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,961
Well, he's afraid
that you want something else.

646
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:04,630
He's afraid you
and the other policemen want...

647
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:07,566
Revenge.

648
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,568
My father once taught me
an important lesson.

649
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:14,073
There is no revenge so complete
as forgiveness.

650
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:18,544
Your father.

651
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:20,646
He's your father too.

652
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:28,921
Okay, look, I promise you
that I will not hurt him.

653
00:31:28,955 --> 00:31:31,958
Okay.

654
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:38,697
Frank there is a clinic
next to the church.

655
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,268
They have drugs,
they have chemicals.

656
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:45,271
Did you have access
to the storage room?

657
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:50,376
Um, I mean, I didn't have
a key or anything.

658
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:53,045
But it would have been
easy enough to break in.

659
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,982
I didn't poison anybody.
I'm not a killer.

660
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:59,585
Oh, right, what about our
last date in the parking lot

661
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:00,619
four months ago?

662
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,521
I wasn't trying
to kill you.

663
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:05,291
You can't be serious.

664
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:07,359
All right,
I thought about it.

665
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:12,164
When I got there,
I couldn't.

666
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:15,434
I didn't want
to become my brother.

667
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,436
At the last minute I decided
to send you a message.

668
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:20,206
(Captain)
What message?

669
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:21,207
Oh, my God.

670
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,043
Captain, the pattern.

671
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:28,214
It's an M.
M for Michael.

672
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:30,516
Yeah, it was an M.

673
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:31,450
How could you miss it?

674
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:35,721
Oh, wha--how was I supposed
to know that was

675
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:38,690
the letter M?

676
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:40,259
This guy's the best detective
in the free world.

677
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:44,163
He didn't know
that was an M!

678
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:45,597
What, you couldn't use
a spray can

679
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:46,665
like everybody else?

680
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,501
Oh, for God's sake,
a message.

681
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:52,038
I just wanted you
to think about what you did.

682
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:53,772
Michael was a good kid

683
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,707
who got screwed up.

684
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:04,050
Wait, you think I don't think
about your brother?

685
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:07,253
I think about your brother
every damn day of my life.

686
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:10,789
It was him or me.

687
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,758
And it still eats me up.

688
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,726
I don't need an M
on a wall

689
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,563
to remember something
like that.

690
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:18,597
No cop does.

691
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:26,405
Get him out of here.

692
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,577
God, Captain,
you gotta read this.

693
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,811
This is from the journal
he kept

694
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,113
while he was
in that church.

695
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:35,747
He feels terrible
about what he did.

696
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:36,782
Look at this one part.

697
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:38,117
It made me cry.

698
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,086
He can't see it.

699
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:42,188
I know, Natalie,
he's not the guy, all right?

700
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:43,589
Okay, moving on.

701
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,524
Lieutenant, you said there
were four other suspects

702
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,359
who might have had
a motive.

703
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:49,128
Actually, we struck out.

704
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:50,696
One's deceased,
one's in the hospital,

705
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:53,199
and two are back in prison.

706
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:55,734
Okay, so it wasn't
Frank Prager.

707
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,069
It's nobody
on your list.

708
00:33:57,103 --> 00:33:58,270
Who sent me
that bottle of wine?

709
00:33:58,304 --> 00:34:01,773
And will they try again?

710
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:02,608
To kill you, I mean.

711
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:05,777
I know what you mean,
Lieutenant.

712
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:14,253
Mom...

713
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:15,287
What?

714
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:20,659
No, look, see?
It looks good.

715
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:23,129
You need one too.

716
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:24,530
Okay.

717
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:30,736
Okay, this, ha ha,
is from Mr. Monk.

718
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,338
You didn't have
to get me anything.

719
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:33,572
But thanks.

720
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,407
Don't tear...

721
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:39,811
A first aid kit.

722
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:41,680
This is
the hot gift this year.

723
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,782
It's the Cadillac
of first aid kits.

724
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,518
I'm talking about
100 feet of gauze.

725
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:48,154
Five different ointments.

726
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:49,355
And a tourniquet.

727
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:50,756
Now, that tourniquet--
Okay, that's great.

728
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,124
We're gonna
look at that later

729
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:55,461
because this
is from both of us.

730
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:57,629
Careful, though,
it's fragile.

731
00:34:57,663 --> 00:35:01,400
Oh.
Oh, no.

732
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,335
Oh.

733
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:10,809
It's alive.

734
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:13,645
It's a living thing.
Is it gonna die?

735
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,383
Well, not for a long
long long time.

736
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:18,617
But it will die eventually.

737
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,552
It's a friend!
A friend who'll die.

738
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:21,853
It's a little friend
to keep you company.

739
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:23,422
A dying friend.
Look.

740
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,291
Look at it.
It's just twitching.

741
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:27,326
It's turning left,
then it swims right.

742
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,394
It's zigzagging.

743
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:29,761
Can't we train it?

744
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,830
Yeah, we can train it...
to swim clockwise.

745
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:35,167
And I'll show you
how to feed it.

746
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:36,168
Oh, oh.
Okay, wait wait wait.

747
00:35:36,202 --> 00:35:37,169
Stay there.
It's okay.

748
00:35:37,203 --> 00:35:39,571
I'll get it
with my new broom.

749
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:41,707
Just wait.

750
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,396
Captain.

751
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,365
Merry Christmas, Alice.

752
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:07,533
Can we come in?

753
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:10,736
So what's going on?

754
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:13,939
Uh, Monk thinks that he knows
who tried to kill me

755
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:15,774
during the
Christmas party.

756
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:16,942
I thought it was
Frank Prager.

757
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:19,445
No, it wasn't Prager.

758
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:20,479
In fact,
it wasn't anybody.

759
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,781
Nobody tried
to kill the captain.

760
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:25,484
That was a trick
to throw us off track.

761
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:26,618
Terry Chasen
was the target.

762
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:28,387
From the beginning.

763
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,223
(Randy)
Alice, we know
you and Terry were involved.

764
00:36:31,257 --> 00:36:32,791
We've got phone records,
credit cards.

765
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:34,960
You were together
for about six months.

766
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:35,961
Seven.

767
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:38,364
Seven months.

768
00:36:38,397 --> 00:36:39,698
Was it because
he went back to his wife?

769
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:40,732
That's why you killed him?

770
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:46,538
Alice, we know how
you did it.

771
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:50,709
The Christmas gift exchange
was your idea.

772
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,411
It was easy to make sure
that the Captain

773
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:54,280
picked Terry's name.

774
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:55,447
(Captain)
Yeah, I remember.

775
00:36:55,481 --> 00:36:56,515
I was the last one
to choose.

776
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,417
And there was
one name left.

777
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,252
(Monk)
The day of the party,

778
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:02,020
you brought a poison bottle
into the office.

779
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,455
You dropped it off
at the front desk.

780
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:06,024
It was addressed
to Captain Stottlemeyer.

781
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,394
(Captain)
And you know
I don't drink port.

782
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:10,696
(Monk)
And at some point,
probably during the party,

783
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,464
you snuck into
the Captain's office

784
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:15,701
and you stole the gift that
he had brought in for Terry.

785
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,469
(Natalie)
When the Captain
couldn't find it,

786
00:37:17,503 --> 00:37:20,372
you suggested replacing it
with the bottle.

787
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:21,640
The poison bottle.

788
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:23,742
(Monk)
It was like a magician
doing sleight of hand.

789
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:26,412
You have everybody
looking the wrong way.

790
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:29,615
It was...brilliant.

791
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:31,883
[oven timer rings]

792
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,287
Excuse me.

793
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:45,263
Alice.

794
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:52,938
Alice, where is the poison?

795
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:55,407
You know, if you
threw it away,

796
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:56,542
we'll find traces of it.

797
00:37:56,575 --> 00:37:59,778
You know that.

798
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:04,316
It's in the basement.

799
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:08,687
How did you know?

800
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,956
Natalie.

801
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:16,728
This is the card
and the envelope

802
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,029
that came with
the whisk broom.

803
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:19,498
Which, by the way,
I've been using.

804
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:20,766
It really is fantastic.

805
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,033
But the card...

806
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:23,869
is a little too big, see?

807
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:25,837
You had to fold it over.

808
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:31,076
This card came with
the poison bottle.

809
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:33,379
It's too small.

810
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:34,746
Alice, you mixed them up.

811
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,815
I mixed them up.

812
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:42,621
I'm usually so organized.

813
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:52,631
I couldn't.

814
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:57,102
I just couldn't
live without him.

815
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,387
I got him.
Thanks.

816
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:19,057
I talked to the DA.

817
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,559
She's gonna
offer you a deal.

818
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:22,528
Eight months plus time served
on the assault.

819
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:29,435
Think about it.

820
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:31,903
And you can decide
when you get back.

821
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:34,406
Where am I going?

822
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,141
You are released
on your own recognizance

823
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,609
for two days.

824
00:39:37,643 --> 00:39:39,010
Now, I am responsible
for you,

825
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:43,048
so don't make me
regret it.

826
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,459
Go home.

827
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:27,826
* I want you to know

828
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:30,829
* May your days
may your days *

829
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:33,031
Aren't you curious?

830
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:36,034
No, I love not knowing.

831
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:38,436
Oh, my God...

832
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:40,772
Julie, sweetie,
what is it?

833
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:47,646
Aaaah!

834
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:56,588
It's a white Christmas!
It's your white Christmas!

835
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:57,856
Yay.

836
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,024
I'm gonna go get my camera.

837
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:01,159
Whoo!
I'm gonna get my coat!

838
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:04,195
You okay?

839
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:05,931
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Monk.

840
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:09,668
* So merry and bright
Lord help us *

841
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:13,839
* I wish all of them honey

842
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:17,776
* And may all

843
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:23,014
* Your Christmases
be so white *

844
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:30,188
* I'm dreaming
of a white Christmas *

845
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:34,860
* I'm dreaming
dreaming of a white *

846
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:38,029
* White Christmas

847
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:40,899
* Baby baby

848
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:44,102
* Lord I'm dreaming
dreaming of a Christmas *

849
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:47,138
