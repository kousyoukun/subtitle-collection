Did you check your briefcase?
Well, yeah.

151
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,420
Why don't you give him one of
these toys from your desk?

152
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:44,088
No, he's been in this office
a million times.
He'll know I recycled it.

153
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,688
But what about...

154
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,927
Does he like port?

155
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,935
I think so.

Oh, I love it.

Good deal.

- What happened?

170
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:31,235
What'd he say?
It's still preliminary.

171
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:34,136
What did he say, Randy?
Poison.

172
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,606
Some kind of strychnine.
Simple and effective.

173
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,269
- Anybody could have made it.
- Couldn't he have tasted it?

174
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,610
- Port's a pretty heavy drink, isn't it?
- It's really strong.

175
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:47,618
He wouldn't taste it in that.
Captain, they need the body.

00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,620
Yeah.

Captain, I'm really so sorry.

181
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,612
He was only 38 years old, right?

182
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,841
Was he married?
No, I think they were separated.

183
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:21,012
No. They're back together.
I just talked toJenny.

184

They got two little girls.
Twins.

<i>Yeah.</i>

Nobody saw who delivered it?

187
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,830
It was sitting at the front desk.
Anybody could have
dropped it off there.

188
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,529
I'm so sorry.
It was my idea for the gift exchange,

- Well, I just woke upJohn DeSilva.

He owns the body shop.
He says they never send gifts or liquor.

191
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,677
He offered
to come down and take a poly,
but it feels like a dead end.

192
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,807

you did business with them.

Anybody could have seen it.

196
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:03,152
Okay, let's get to it.
I've, uh, narrowed it down
to five possible suspects.

197
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,526
<i>People who may have had a grudge,</i>
<i>people you arrested</i>...

198
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:09,658
- It was Frank Prager.
- Yes, sir. Frank's on the list.

199
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,363
He's number one.
Who's Prager?

200
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:16,067
Ayear ago,
the captain shot and killed
a bank robber named Mike Prager.

201
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,577
Frank's his brother.
A few months ago,
he tried to settle the score.

202
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,909
He came at me in a parking lot.

203
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,575
He got off five rounds,
and he missed.

204
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,245
- He got away.
- Disappeared.
And it looks like he missed again.

205
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,348
- All right. Why don't we each take a name?
- Lieutenant, you're wasting your time.
I'm telling you, it's Frank Prager.

206
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,757
All right.
How about this?

207
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,729
How about we split up into two teams?
Your team gets Prager.

208
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:42,028
My team will take the rest of the list.

209
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,093
Okay. Hmm.
Let's see.

210
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,897

I'm picking my team.

<i>I'll take, uh</i>... <i>I'll take Monk.</i>

213
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,410
<i>Okay, uh, I'll take Natalie.</i>

214
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,920
Oh, I can't.
Julie's waiting for me at home.

215
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:07,357
<i>Fine. Um, I'll take, uh</i>...

216
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:12,554
You'll take Robbins.
Meet us back here at noon.

217
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,799
I'll take Robbins.
Let's go.

218
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,470
Four months ago...
It was a Tuesday night.

219
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:30,538
I came out of the bar, 2:00 a.m.

220
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,812
<i>They took my keys,</i>
<i>so I'm walking home.</i>

221
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,221
<i>I was alone.</i>
<i>I was pretty toasted.</i>

222
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,555
<i>And that streetlight was on,</i>
<i>'cause I could still see.</i>

223
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,130
And he was waiting.
He was by...

224
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:51,602
There was a big, black van here.
He was waiting behind it.
Uh, must have been here all night.

225
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:56,329
<i>He steps out. I'm standing</i>
<i>right about where you are now.</i>

226
00:17:56,408 --> 00:18:00,674
<i>I knew who it was right away.</i>
<i>It was Frank Prager,</i>
<i>and he wanted me dead.</i>

227
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,010
<i>I could see it in his eyes.</i>

228
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,178
<i>He aims a Glock 17 at my head,</i>
<i>caps o</i>ff <i>f</i>i<i>ve rounds,</i>

229
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,890
<i>and then</i>...

230
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,284
Then he disappeared.

231
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,886
Until last night.

232
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,762
He was only 12 feet away
with a streetlight behind him.

233
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,768
It's not a hard shot.

234
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,361
You said he was a veteran,
special ops?
Yeah.

235
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,497
Maybe he was as toasted as me.

236
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,208
Or maybe it was a miracle.
Maybe it was.

237
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,506
And they just left
the bullet holes there.

238
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:42,042
Well, it's probably good
for business at this place.

239
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,649
It adds to the mystique.
But this pattern
does not look random.

240
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,956
Two, one, two.
He had a Glock 17.

241
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:53,054
He could have fired 20 rounds.
He only squeezed off five?

242
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,533
Two, one, two.
Monk, it doesn't matter.

243
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,571
He's given up on guns.
The guy's graduated to strychnine.

244
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,663
It's a different M.O.
He's special ops, remember?

245
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,174
Those guys know a hundred different ways
to kill somebody.

246
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,734
Look, Prager wants me dead.

247
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,747
I'm the guy that shot his brother.

248
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:14,309
He's married, right,
with a daughter?
Yeah. Cute kid, seven years old.

249
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,514
Is he in touch with them?
Well, we staked out the house
for a couple of weeks,

250
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,217
but he never called
or showed his face.

251
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,624
Well, let's check it out.
Maybe he's home for Christmas.

252
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,855
Monk, l-l-I can't go
near the place.

253
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,264
The, uh, wife filed a complaint against me,
said that I had been harassing her.

254
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:33,998
Why would she say that?
Uh, probably because
I've been harassing her.

255
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:40,374
What?
She's never seen you.

256
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,657
[Sighs]
God, how much longer?

257
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,787
Natalie, this is a stakeout.
You never know how long.

258
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,856
That's what makes a stakeout
so much fun.

259
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,534
Oh, you wanna play 20 questions?

260
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,769
Sure.
Okay. All right.
You can go first.

261
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:15,404
You have to think of somebody,
anybody, living or dead.

262
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,641
Okay, I've got it.
Uh...

263
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,117
Is it Trudy?

264
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,180
Trudy who?
Trudy Monk.
Your wife!

265
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,385
Yes.
Thank you.

266
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,451
That was fun.

267
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:37,266
So, Mr. Monk,
what do you want for Christmas?

268
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:41,534
A miracle.
Yeah? I could use one of those.

269
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:45,168
Julie hates it here
because it never snows.

270
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,735
She's been praying
for this white Christmas.

271
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,974
It hasn't snowed in San Francisco
in nine years.

272
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:53,313
The last time it snowed
was the day Trudy died.

273
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,319
Hmm.

274
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,524
Oh, my God! I can't stand it. Let's just
go up there and knock on the door.

We get carolers all the time.
Usually there's a whole group.

284
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:50,066
Right. We started with a big crowd.
We had a group.
A big group.

285
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,804
Bob, Paul, Sue...
Big crowd.
And, um, we had, um...

But then we lost
them somehow.
Yeah.

- Creative differences.

They really weren't comfortable
with religious material.

290

- In a way.

298

Yeah, I've been looking for him.
Do you know where he is?

299
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,955
- Shh. It's a secret.
- It's a secret? Okay,
I won't tell anybody.

<i>Just get out of my house.</i>

That went well.

306
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,799
Okay, hold on. Hold on.
Do we have a plan?
Well, no.

307
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:25,098
I need to talk to the little girl again,
just for a minute.

308
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,833
She knows something.
I'm telling you.
Who are all these people?

309
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,307
These folks have forgotten
the true meaning of Christmas.

310
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,901
Yeah, which is what?
Which is leaving me alone.

311
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:37,574
Well, I love it.
I love everything about it.
The crowds, the shopping, the decorations.

312
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:40,948
And the fact that it's horrible
doesn't bother you?

313
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,524
Oh, my gosh!
I can't believe he's still here.

314

<i>I used to work here.</i>

Wait a minute.
How many jobs have you had?
It was just after high school.

316
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:07,644
It was a summer thing.
I worked at the information booth,
but only lasted for three weeks.

317
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:10,010
What happened?
<i>Oh, Mr. Preston liked me a lot.</i>

318
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:13,539
A little too much.
Well, I've never had that problem.

00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:19,323
Ooh.
[Laughs]

320
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,484
I'll be right back.
Where are you going?

321
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:26,520
- I'm gonna go find Mr. Preston.
He owes me a favor.
- What kind of favor?

322
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,963

We have some new rules here
in Santa's workshop.

335
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:42,065
Before anybody can sit on Santa's lap,

336
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,804
you have to use these magic wipes
and wipe your hands.

337

Yeah! Wiping is fun!

And no touching Santa's face.

<i>And try not to breathe on Santa.</i>

<i>Remember, Santa isn't always jolly.</i>

341

Sometimes Santa's a little bit sad.

342
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,593
Okay? Who's first?

343
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:08,665
No, no, no. Just stand...
stand over there.
Have you been a good boy?

344
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:15,067

You're Santa Claus.

I don't think so.
He has to sit on your lap.
Here, jump up.

No, no, no.
Okay, th-th-that's too close.

Just a little further there.
That's good.

Yes, ma'am, I do.
You obviously have
very strong feelings about this.

Brad's not his name.
You're right.

but I know the man. He's been
working in our outreach program.

408
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:44,870
He's been feeding the hungry
and the homeless every night.

409
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:48,902
When they're too tired to come here,
he brings the food to them.
Maybe he has a guilty conscience.

410
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,381
Well, any conscience at all
is a rare thing these days.

411
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,384
What do you want, Captain?

412
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,588
I want justice.

413
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:02,092
Well, he's afraid that
you want something else.

414
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:07,826
He's afraid you and the other
policemen want...
Revenge.

415
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,890
My father once taught me
an important lesson.

416

There is no revenge so complete
as forgiveness.

417
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,703
Your father.
He's your father too.

418
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,746
Okay, look, I promise you
that I will not hurt him.

00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,811
Okay.

420
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:36,791
Frank, there is a clinic
next to the church.

421
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,093
They have drugs.
They have chemicals.

422
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,930
Did you have access
to the storage room?

423
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:49,940
Um, I mean, I didn't have a key
or anything,

424
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:53,068
but it would have been easy enough
to break in.

425
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,806
I didn't poison anybody.
I'm not a killer.

426
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,613
Oh, right. What about
our last date in the parking lot
four months ago?

427
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:04,314
I wasn't trying to kill you.
You can't be serious.

428
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,358
All right.
I thought about it.

429
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:12,089
When I got there, I couldn't.

430
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:17,362

At the last minute,
I decided to send you a message.

Oh, my God.

432

<i>Captain, the pattern was an "M. '"</i>
<i>"M'"for Michael.</i>

<i>How could you miss it?</i>

Oh, well, how was I supposed to know
that was the letter "M"?

like everybody else?

Oh, for God's sake.

don't think about your brother?

442

I think about your brother
every damn day of my life.

443

It was him or me,
and it still eats me up.

444
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:17,320
I don't need an "M" on a wall
to remember something like that.

[Sighs] God, Captain,
you gotta read this.

449
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,034
This is from the journal he kept
while he was in that church.

450
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,706
He feels terrible about what he did.
Look at this one part.

451
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,772
It made me cry.
He can't see it.

<i>Yeah</i>... <i>No, I know, Natalie.</i>
<i>He's not the guy, all right?</i>

453
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,252
Okay, moving on. Lieutenant,
you said there were four other
suspects who might have had a motive.

454
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,588
Actually, we struck out.

455
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:53,494
One's deceased, one's in the hospital,
and, uh, two are back in prison.

456
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:56,658
Okay, so it wasn't Frank Prager.
It's nobody on your list.

457
00:33:56,734 --> 00:34:00,602
- Who sent me that bottle of wine?
- And will they try again?

458
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:05,702
- To kill you, I mean.
- I know what you mean, Lieutenant.

459
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,116
Mmm.
Mom.

Okay.
And you need one too.

Oh, okay.

Well, not for a long, long,
long time.

477
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:19,547
- But it will die eventually.
- It's a friend!

478

A friend who'll die.
It's a little friend
to keep you company.

A dying friend.
Look. Look at it.
It's just twitching.

It's turning left,
then it swims right.

481

It's zigzagging!
Can't we train it?

482
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:31,721
Yeah, we can train it
to swim clockwise.

483
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,857
- And I can show you
how to feed this. Oh.
- Oh. Okay, wait. Stay there.

during the Christmas party.

I thought it was Frank Prager.
No, it wasn't Prager.

- In fact, it wasn't anybody.
- Nobody tried to kill the captain.

That was a trick

Seven.

501
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:40,525
- Seven months.
- Was it because he went back to his wife?
That's why you killed him?

Alice, we know how you did it.
