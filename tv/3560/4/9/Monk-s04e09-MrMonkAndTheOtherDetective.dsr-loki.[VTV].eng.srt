Terry, hey.

16
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:10,070
That's not straight.
The left side's too low.

17
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,844
- It's good enough.
- No, it's not.

18
00:03:11,844 --> 00:03:14,227
- Adrian Monk is coming.
- Oh, hell.

19
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,367
Okay.

20
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:16,384
Captain. / Yeah.

21
00:03:16,384 --> 00:03:18,167
I took a message.
Your wife called.

22
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:21,552
She said her mother's sick
and she won't be able to make it tonight.

23
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:23,406
Her mother's...

24
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:25,412
Well, that's too bad.

25
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:28,595
And these are the duty roasters for
next week. You have to sign them.

26
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:30,876
Thank you, Alice.

27
00:03:31,138 --> 00:03:32,867
You looking forward to
our little party?

28
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:34,358
I guess so.

29
00:03:34,358 --> 00:03:35,843
How late do these
things usually go?

30
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:39,762
Last year, Karen and I left
at about 2:30 a.m.

31
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:42,989
And Terry, Detective Chasen
was still standing on a table

32
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,114
in his boxer shorts singing
'Help me, Rhonda' in Spanish.

33
00:03:46,114 --> 00:03:48,161
That's a lie.
I don't speak Spanish.

34
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,254
- Oh, yes, you do.
- Oh, and this came for you.

35
00:03:51,254 --> 00:03:53,819
Someone dropped it off
the front desk.

36
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,578
Captain Leland Stottlemeyer.

37
00:03:57,662 --> 00:04:03,592
Captain Stottlemeyer, thank you
for your business, Eastwood Auto Supply.

38
00:04:03,592 --> 00:04:07,723
You know what this is, Alice?
This is a bribe.

39
00:04:07,723 --> 00:04:10,195
Somebody is trying to influence
public policy.

40
00:04:10,195 --> 00:04:13,430
And I think it might work.

41
00:04:25,957 --> 00:04:27,224
Hey.

42
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:31,979
I was just tuning it up for ya.

43
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,233
- It's a nice guitar.
- It's Karen's.

44
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:38,538
You're gonna play today?

45
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:40,055
We'll see how it goes.

46
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:42,512
You know, I can run home and grab
my gibson and we can jam.

47
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:45,179
We used to have a rock band
back in high school.

48
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:46,604
Randy Disher Project.

49
00:04:46,604 --> 00:04:48,552
That's a good name.
How'd you come up with that?

50
00:04:48,552 --> 00:04:55,823
Well, my name's Randy Disher
and then, Project.

51
00:04:55,823 --> 00:04:58,406
You know, Randy,
I don't really jam.

52
00:04:58,406 --> 00:04:59,893
- I'm more of an old folky kinda guy.
- That's cool.

53
00:04:59,893 --> 00:05:02,650
That's cool, too.
I mean, I could just sing harmony.

54
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,459
Good.

55
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:06,301
Whoa, hey, what'd you get?

56
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:10,798
This is from the body shop
down the street.

57
00:05:14,372 --> 00:05:16,768
Ugh, hell, it's port.
I hate port.

58
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:18,964
I love port.

59
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:22,596
You know, I think I'll bring
it home for Karen.

60
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:23,816
What, does she likes port?

61
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:25,730
It's kind of an acquired taste.

62
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,656
I like port.
A lot of people don't.

63
00:05:27,656 --> 00:05:30,791
Randy, I'm taking it home.

64
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:48,325
Mr. Monk, it's 8:30.

65
00:05:48,325 --> 00:05:50,797
I'm ready when you are.

66
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:57,034
- How is your side looking?
- So far, my side is perfect.

67
00:05:58,564 --> 00:05:59,970
What's wrong?

68
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,078
- Is it beautiful?
- Is what beautiful?

69
00:06:03,078 --> 00:06:05,218
Snow.

70
00:06:05,218 --> 00:06:07,892
You've never seen snow?

71
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:10,175
Oh, it's very beautiful.

72
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:13,520
No two flakes are the same.

73
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:15,941
But somehow it's still beautiful.

74
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:16,859
Mr. Monk, come on.

75
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:18,020
We gotta go.
Where's your present?

76
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,871
Oh, it's in the hallway.

77
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:23,254
Sweetie, are you sure okay
with Mr. Monk being here?

78
00:06:23,254 --> 00:06:26,072
Yeah, it's okay, mom.
It's what Christmas is all about, right?

79
00:06:26,072 --> 00:06:28,752
Helping people. / Yes.

80
00:06:28,752 --> 00:06:29,568
Who's that for?

81
00:06:29,568 --> 00:06:32,043
This one's from Trudy.
It's for me.

82
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:33,598
- From Trudy?
- Yeah.

83
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:35,762
After she died, I found it.

84
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,311
Every Christmas I put it
under the tree.

85
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:40,646
- You never open it?
- No.

86
00:06:40,646 --> 00:06:41,701
What's that one?

87
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,313
This one's for Captain Stottlemeyer.
I picked his name.

88
00:06:44,313 --> 00:06:46,573
Everybody picked a name out of a hat.
Whoever you got,

89
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,678
you're their secret Santa and
you have to buy 'em a present.

90
00:06:48,678 --> 00:06:49,834
What did you get him?

91
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:51,875
All I can tell you is that
he's gonna love it.

92
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,549
It's gonna be a great party.
I'm not completely dreading it.

93
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:57,820
That's the spirit.
Okay, lock up.

94
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,635
Have a good night.
Don't wait up.

95
00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:54,074
Hey.

96
00:07:54,544 --> 00:07:56,060
Hey. / Oh, nice sweater.

97
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,557
Oh, thanks. It's a gift from my aunt Kay
in Boston. She knitted it herself.

98
00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:01,285
Wow. / Mmm hmm.

99
00:08:01,285 --> 00:08:02,976
Yeah, she said it took her months.

100
00:08:02,976 --> 00:08:05,359
- I'm her favorite nephew.
- I'm sure you are.

101
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,414
I'll be right back, okay?

102
00:08:09,993 --> 00:08:12,170
Hey.
Merry Christmas.

103
00:08:15,455 --> 00:08:17,876
You two cousins?

104
00:08:19,474 --> 00:08:20,660
Where did you get that?

105
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,264
Walmart. 15 bucks.

106
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:28,548
Aunt Kay probably went to Walmart

107
00:08:28,548 --> 00:08:31,674
and saw that sweater and went home
and knitted me the same one.

108
00:08:31,674 --> 00:08:33,418
That sweater inspired this one.

109
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:35,602
You can still see where
she tore the tag off.

110
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:38,175
It's the thought that counts.

111
00:08:45,804 --> 00:08:46,767
Alice.

112
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:50,167
Hello, Adrian.
Merry Christmas.

113
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,682
I haven't seen you around lately.

114
00:08:53,682 --> 00:08:57,082
I don't go out much
during the holidays.

115
00:08:57,082 --> 00:09:00,680
It's so depressing.

116
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,973
I don't have to tell you.
I mean, you're not married, eighther?

117
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:06,049
You don't have anyone.

118
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:07,965
That's true.

119
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:13,192
It's tough.
Especially for people our age.

120
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:23,204
¢Ü Oh holy night!
The stars are brightly shining. ¢Ü

121
00:09:23,204 --> 00:09:29,155
¢Ü It is the night of our dear Savior's birth! ¢Ü

122
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:34,758
¢Ü Long lay the world in

123
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:40,942
¢Ü Till he appeared and

124
00:09:40,942 --> 00:09:45,502
¢Ü A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices ¢Ü

125
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:50,884
¢Ü For yonder breaks

126
00:09:50,884 --> 00:09:55,261
¢Ü Fall on your knees ¢Ü

127
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:59,672
¢Ü Oh hear the angel voices ¢Ü

128
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:04,382
¢Ü Oh night divine ¢Ü

129
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:09,172
¢Ü Oh night when Christ was born ¢Ü

130
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:11,341
¢Ü Oh night ¢Ü

131
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:15,321
¢Ü Oh night ¢Ü

132
00:10:17,503 --> 00:10:23,590
¢Ü Oh holy night ¢Ü

133
00:10:31,594 --> 00:10:34,548
Okay, excuse me everybody.
It's almost midnight.

134
00:10:34,548 --> 00:10:39,522
So it's time for all you secret Santas
to go get your presents.

135
00:10:44,001 --> 00:10:44,942
Captain.

136
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:47,719
Hey. / Merry Christmas.

137
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:50,600
Oh, you got me.

138
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:56,886
It's a...it's an air purifier
for your house.

139
00:10:56,886 --> 00:10:59,927
Are you saying my house smells?

140
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,601
Not your house.

141
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:08,560
But houses like yours
sometimes get a...

142
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:16,451
odor that's, you know sour or
very unpleasant kind of stench of...

143
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:18,933
- Not your house.
- Thank you.

144
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:20,752
Thank you, Monk.

145
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:27,335
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

146
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:29,461
Merry Christmas to you.

147
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,109
Do you know what Ebay is?

148
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,611
Ebay, no. / Good.

149
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,393
I'm your secret Santa.

150
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:43,664
Alice, thank you.
Merry Christmas.

151
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:51,437
- Oh, it's a funny card.
- Yes, it is.

152
00:11:51,437 --> 00:11:56,867
You can tell because of
the exclamation points.

153
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,922
What'd you get?

154
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:06,308
Oh, my god.

155
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:09,033
Alice.

156
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:12,941
This I love.

157
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,794
Thanks.

158
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:26,182
Are you okay?

159
00:12:26,182 --> 00:12:27,635
The present that I bought for Terry.

160
00:12:27,635 --> 00:12:29,020
Do you know what happened to it?

161
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,387
No, what was it?

162
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:32,758
A little hair trimmer thingy.
It was this big.

163
00:12:32,758 --> 00:12:35,255
- I wrapped it myself.
- Did you check your briefcase?

164
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,835
Yeah.

165
00:12:37,493 --> 00:12:39,325
Why don't you give him one
of these toys from your desk?

166
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:42,809
No, he's been in this office a million times.
He'd know I recycled it.

167
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:44,861
Or what about..?

168
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:48,813
Does he like port?

169
00:12:48,813 --> 00:12:50,736
I think so.

170
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,213
Merry Christmas, my friend.

171
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:03,857
Like port?

172
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:06,074
Oh, I love it. / Excellent.

173
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:08,185
Thanks, Captain.

174
00:13:08,185 --> 00:13:10,993
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

175
00:13:54,388 --> 00:13:55,590
Terry?

176
00:13:55,774 --> 00:13:57,119
Terry!

177
00:13:59,468 --> 00:14:00,373
Terry!

178
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:02,205
Terry! Hey.

179
00:14:02,205 --> 00:14:03,497
Hey, hey, buddy.

180
00:14:03,497 --> 00:14:05,268
Terry. / Terry.

181
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:06,183
Hey.

182
00:14:06,183 --> 00:14:09,792
Hey, call an ambulance.
John, John, call it in.

183
00:14:10,843 --> 00:14:13,240
What happened?

184
00:14:26,202 --> 00:14:27,312
What did he say?

185
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:30,232
It's still preliminary.

186
00:14:30,232 --> 00:14:32,696
What did he say, Randy?

187
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:34,987
Poison.
Some kind of strychnine.

188
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:37,374
Some gone effective.
Anybody could've made it.

189
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:38,783
Couldn't he have tasted it?

190
00:14:38,783 --> 00:14:41,571
- Port's pretty heavy drink, isn't it?
- It's really strong.

191
00:14:41,571 --> 00:14:44,272
He wouldn't taste it in that.

192
00:14:44,272 --> 00:14:48,632
Captain, they need the body.

193
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:55,394
This was meant for me.

194
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,535
Well, there weren't for the grace of god.

195
00:14:58,923 --> 00:15:02,019
This was meant for me.

196
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:04,632
A grace of god.

197
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,268
Captain.

198
00:15:09,503 --> 00:15:11,662
I'm really so sorry.

199
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:14,541
He was only 38 years old, right?
Was he married?

200
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,609
- Nah, I think they were separated.
- No.

201
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:20,049
They're back together.
I just talked to Jenny.

202
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:23,632
They got two little girls.
Twins.

203
00:15:24,994 --> 00:15:28,270
Just a card.
It came with the bottle. / Yeah.

204
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,671
And nobody saw who delivered it?

205
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:32,391
It was sitting at the front desk.

206
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:34,966
- Anybody could've dropped it off there.
- I'm so sorry.

207
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:38,286
It was my idea for the gift exchange,
secret Santa, I just..

208
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:40,274
Alice, you can't blame yourself.

209
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:43,252
Well, I just woke up John DaSilva.
He owns the body shop.

210
00:15:43,252 --> 00:15:45,704
He says they never sent
gifts or liqouor.

211
00:15:45,704 --> 00:15:48,224
He offered to come down and
take a poly but it feels like a dead end.

212
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:50,247
Whoever sent it knew you
did business with them.

213
00:15:50,247 --> 00:15:53,084
That narrows it down, right?

214
00:15:53,084 --> 00:15:55,316
Exclusive parts supplier for the SFPD.

215
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:57,490
It's in all their ads.
Anybody could've seen it.

216
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,198
Okay, let's get to it.

217
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:01,963
I've narrowed it down to
5 possible suspects.

218
00:16:01,963 --> 00:16:04,664
People who may have had a grudge,
people you arrested..

219
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,074
It was Frank Prager.

220
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:09,493
Yes, sir, Frank's on the list.
He's number one.

221
00:16:09,493 --> 00:16:11,434
Who's Prager?

222
00:16:11,434 --> 00:16:15,085
A year ago, captain shot and killed
a bank robber named Mike Prager.

223
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:16,438
Frank's his brother.

224
00:16:16,438 --> 00:16:18,779
A few months ago,
tried to settle the score.

225
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:23,618
He came at me in a parking lot.
He got off five rounds and he missed.

226
00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:25,306
- Got away?
- Disappeared.

227
00:16:25,306 --> 00:16:27,345
And it looks like he missed again.

228
00:16:27,345 --> 00:16:28,563
All right, Why don't we each take a name?

229
00:16:28,563 --> 00:16:32,398
Lieutenant, you're wasting your time.
I'm telling you it's Frank Prager.

230
00:16:32,398 --> 00:16:34,753
All right.
How about this?

231
00:16:34,753 --> 00:16:36,656
How about we split up into
two teams?

232
00:16:36,656 --> 00:16:41,099
Your team gets Prager and
my team will take the rest of the list.

233
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:42,473
Okay.

234
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:44,616
Let's see.

235
00:16:45,902 --> 00:16:47,235
What are you doing?

236
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:48,449
I'm picking my team.

237
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:51,511
I'll take...

238
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,155
I'll take Monk.

239
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,701
No, I'll take Monk.

240
00:16:56,701 --> 00:16:58,461
Okay.

241
00:16:58,461 --> 00:16:59,941
I'll take Natalie.

242
00:16:59,941 --> 00:17:02,480
Oh, I can't.
Julie's waiting for me at home.

243
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,586
Fine.

244
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:07,434
Um, I'll take...

245
00:17:07,434 --> 00:17:09,459
You'll take Robins.

246
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:12,435
Meet us back here at noon.

247
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,004
I'll take Robins.

248
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,644
Let's go.

249
00:17:22,712 --> 00:17:25,578
Four months ago, it was
a Tuesday night.

250
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:30,490
I came out of the bar, 2 a.m.

251
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:34,804
They took my keys so I'm
walking home.

252
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,254
I was alone.

253
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:38,237
I was pretty toasted.

254
00:17:38,237 --> 00:17:42,080
That street light was on,
'cuz I could still see.

255
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,516
And he was waiting.
He was by...

256
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:49,087
There was a big black van here.
He waiting behind it.

257
00:17:49,248 --> 00:17:51,747
Must've been here all night.

258
00:17:51,747 --> 00:17:53,126
He steps out.

259
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:55,647
I'm standing right about where
you are now.

260
00:17:55,647 --> 00:17:58,540
I knew who it was right away.
It was Frank Prager

261
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,672
and he wanted me dead.
I could see it in his eyes.

262
00:18:02,672 --> 00:18:07,462
He aims Glock 17
to my head, caps off 5 rounds.

263
00:18:09,157 --> 00:18:11,252
And then..

264
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:15,452
And then he disappeared.

265
00:18:15,452 --> 00:18:17,899
Until last night.

266
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:19,530
He was only 12 feet away.

267
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,779
With the street light behind him,
it's not a hard shot.

268
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:25,795
You said he was a veteran
special ops? / Yeah.

269
00:18:25,795 --> 00:18:28,795
Maybe he was as toasted as me.

270
00:18:28,795 --> 00:18:31,276
Or maybe it was a miracle.

271
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,350
Maybe it was.

272
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,476
And they just left the bullet holes there.

273
00:18:37,476 --> 00:18:41,373
Well, it's probably good for business
at this place.

274
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:43,181
It adds to the mystique.

275
00:18:43,181 --> 00:18:45,683
This pattern does not look random.

276
00:18:45,683 --> 00:18:47,606
2-1-2

277
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:50,410
He had a Glock 17.
He could've fired 20 rounds.

278
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,565
He only squeezed off 5.
2-1-2.

279
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,587
Monk.
It doesn't matter.

280
00:18:55,587 --> 00:18:58,826
He's given up on guns.
They guy's graduated to strychnine.

281
00:18:58,826 --> 00:19:00,944
- It's a different M.O.
- He's special ops, remember?

282
00:19:00,944 --> 00:19:04,203
Those guys know a hundred
different ways to kill somebody.

283
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:05,793
Prager wants me dead.

284
00:19:05,793 --> 00:19:08,778
I'm the guy that shot his brother.

285
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:11,709
He's married, right?
With a daughter.

286
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:13,387
Yeah, cute kid, 7 years old.

287
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:14,667
Is he in touch with them?

288
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:16,622
Well, we staked out the house
for a couple of weeks,

289
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,485
but he never called or showed his face.

290
00:19:18,485 --> 00:19:21,368
Well, let's check it out.
Maybe..maybe he's home for Christmas.

291
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,780
Look, Monk.
I can't go near the place.

292
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,650
The wife filed a complaint against me,
said that I had been harrassing her.

293
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,805
Why would she say that?

294
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:34,847
Probably because I have been
harrassing her.

295
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:39,745
- What?
- She's never seen you.

296
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:54,645
How much longer?

297
00:19:54,645 --> 00:19:56,383
Natalie, this is stake-out.

298
00:19:56,383 --> 00:19:57,842
You never know how long.

299
00:19:57,842 --> 00:20:01,736
That's what makes a stake-out
so much fun.

300
00:20:05,942 --> 00:20:08,548
Oh, you wanna play 20 questions?

301
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:11,347
Sure. / Okay.
Right, you can go first.

302
00:20:11,347 --> 00:20:15,455
You have to think of somebody,
anybody, living or dead.

303
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:17,994
Okay, I got it.

304
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:22,957
Is it Trudy?

305
00:20:23,234 --> 00:20:25,125
- Trudy who?
- Trudy Monk, your wife.

306
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,377
Yes, thank you.

307
00:20:27,377 --> 00:20:29,455
That was fun.

308
00:20:32,795 --> 00:20:36,263
So, Mr. Monk, what do you want
for Christmas?

309
00:20:36,263 --> 00:20:37,948
A miracle.

310
00:20:37,948 --> 00:20:40,519
Yeah.
I could use one of those.

311
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:44,174
Julie hates it here because
it never snows.

312
00:20:44,174 --> 00:20:46,826
She's been praying for this
white Christmas.

313
00:20:46,826 --> 00:20:48,997
Well, it hasn't snowed in
San Fransisco in 9 years.

314
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:54,225
The last time it snowed
was the day Trudy died.

315
00:20:57,343 --> 00:21:00,047
Oh, my god, I can't stand it.
Let's just go up there and knock on the door.

316
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:02,031
And say what?

317
00:21:02,263 --> 00:21:08,454
¢Ü Silent night, holy night ¢Ü

318
00:21:08,454 --> 00:21:14,667
¢Ü All is calm, all is bright ¢Ü

319
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:20,471
¢Ü Round yon virgin mother and Child ¢Ü

320
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:22,088
- It's dripping.
- It's suppposed to drip.

321
00:21:22,088 --> 00:21:27,739
¢Ü Holy Infant, so tender and mild ¢Ü

322
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:34,634
¢Ü Sleep in heavenly peace ¢Ü

323
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:39,404
¢Ü Sleep in heavenly peace ¢Ü

324
00:21:39,404 --> 00:21:40,858
Ouch.

325
00:21:41,271 --> 00:21:42,610
Merry Christmas.

326
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,834
Yeah, we get carolers all the time.
Ususally, there's whole group.

327
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:46,684
Right. / Yeah.

328
00:21:46,684 --> 00:21:49,959
- We had a group.
- We started with a big crowd.

329
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,875
And then we had..

330
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:55,621
But then we lost them somehow
and then dropped out.

331
00:21:55,621 --> 00:21:57,013
Yeah, they just left.

332
00:21:57,013 --> 00:21:59,246
- What happened?
- Creative differences.

333
00:21:59,246 --> 00:22:02,043
They really weren't comfortable
with the religious material.

334
00:22:02,043 --> 00:22:04,196
Just wanted to a whole..
whole different thing.

335
00:22:04,196 --> 00:22:06,678
Other.. like a Vegas style.
We were not..

336
00:22:06,678 --> 00:22:07,842
No. / Not into it.

337
00:22:07,842 --> 00:22:09,208
- But we wish them well.
- Yeah.

338
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,302
- Can I use your bathroom?
- Show business is a ...

339
00:22:11,302 --> 00:22:14,111
Yeah, sure.
Come on in.

340
00:22:26,293 --> 00:22:28,309
Are you Dory?

341
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:29,699
How did you know?

342
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:33,191
Um, well, your daddy told me.

343
00:22:33,191 --> 00:22:34,972
Do you know my daddy?

344
00:22:34,972 --> 00:22:36,589
In a way, yeah.

345
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:39,714
I've been looking for him.
Do you know where he is?

346
00:22:39,714 --> 00:22:41,429
Sshh.
It's a secret.

347
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:43,383
It's a secret, okay.
I won't tell anybody.

348
00:22:43,383 --> 00:22:45,385
What are you doing?

349
00:22:45,385 --> 00:22:47,735
I was just...

350
00:22:48,613 --> 00:22:50,163
Are you a cop?

351
00:22:50,163 --> 00:22:53,103
- Okay, look, here's the thing.
- Dory, go to your room.

352
00:22:53,103 --> 00:22:55,147
I want you out.
Just get out of my house.

353
00:22:55,147 --> 00:22:58,464
Haven't you people done enough
to this family?

354
00:23:00,554 --> 00:23:02,710
That went well.

355
00:23:18,353 --> 00:23:20,137
Okay, hold it, hold it.
Do we have a plan?

356
00:23:20,137 --> 00:23:23,003
What? No, I need to talk to
the little girl again.

357
00:23:23,003 --> 00:23:25,644
Just for a minute.
She knows something, I'm telling you.

358
00:23:25,644 --> 00:23:27,944
Who are all these people?

359
00:23:27,944 --> 00:23:30,266
These folks have forgotten
the true meaning of Christmas.

360
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:32,929
- Yeah? Which is what?
- Which is leaving me alone.

361
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:34,538
Well, I love it.
I love everything about it.

362
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,722
The crowd, the shopping,
the decorations.

363
00:23:36,722 --> 00:23:39,964
The fact that it's horrible
doesn't bother you?

364
00:23:53,446 --> 00:23:56,194
My gosh, I can't believe
he's still here.

365
00:23:56,194 --> 00:23:59,235
Who's here? / Mr. Preston.
I used to work here.

366
00:23:59,235 --> 00:24:01,452
Wait a minute.
How many jobs have you had?

367
00:24:01,452 --> 00:24:03,581
It was just after high school.
It was a summer thing.

368
00:24:03,581 --> 00:24:06,486
I worked at the information booth,
but it only lasted for 3 weeks.

369
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,221
What happened?

370
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:10,263
Mr. Preston liked me, a lot,
a little too much.

371
00:24:10,263 --> 00:24:13,438
Oh, I never had that problem.

372
00:24:13,763 --> 00:24:16,297
SANTA WILL RETURN
IN 20 MINUTES.

373
00:24:17,845 --> 00:24:19,631
- I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

374
00:24:19,631 --> 00:24:23,630
I'm gonna go find Mr. Preston.
He owes me a favor.

375
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,824
What kind of favor?

376
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,238
Who's waiting to see Santa Claus?

377
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,002
Yeah.

378
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:36,318
Well, you're in luck.

379
00:24:36,318 --> 00:24:40,061
Because guess who just landed
straight from the North Pole?

380
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:43,056
Santa Claus!

381
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:50,652
Yay!

382
00:25:19,216 --> 00:25:20,687
Ho, ho, ho.

383
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,925
Yay!

384
00:25:32,856 --> 00:25:35,474
Ssh. Okay, everybody listen up.
Okay?

385
00:25:35,474 --> 00:25:38,407
We have some new rules
here in Santa's workshop.

386
00:25:38,407 --> 00:25:41,109
Before anybody can sit on Santa's lap,

387
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:45,716
you have to use these magic wipes
and wipe your hand.

388
00:25:45,716 --> 00:25:49,041
Yay, wiping is fun.

389
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:51,928
And no touching Santa's face.

390
00:25:51,928 --> 00:25:54,863
And try not to breathe on Santa.

391
00:25:54,863 --> 00:25:57,353
Remember, Santa isn't always jolly.

392
00:25:57,353 --> 00:25:59,757
Sometimes Santa's a little bit sad.

393
00:25:59,757 --> 00:26:02,464
Okay?
Who's first?

394
00:26:03,773 --> 00:26:05,055
No, no, no, just..

395
00:26:05,055 --> 00:26:06,385
Just stand over there.

396
00:26:06,385 --> 00:26:08,781
Have you been a good boy?

397
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:14,102
Have you? / Mr. Monk, he's gotta
sit on your lap. You're Santa Claus.

398
00:26:14,102 --> 00:26:16,300
- I don't think so.
- He has to sit on your lap. Here.

399
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,886
Jump up. / No, no, no.

400
00:26:17,886 --> 00:26:19,350
Yep. / That's too close.

401
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:22,041
All right, just on the knee.
On the knee there, a little further.

402
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:24,485
A little further.
He's squirming.

403
00:26:24,485 --> 00:26:26,682
Santa doesn't like the squirmers.

404
00:26:26,682 --> 00:26:28,922
I love you, Santa.

405
00:26:30,128 --> 00:26:31,404
What is she..
What is she doing?

406
00:26:31,404 --> 00:26:34,270
- She wants a kiss.
- No.

407
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,557
No, no, sorry.
No. Good. You're done.

408
00:26:37,776 --> 00:26:39,651
Okay, that's it.
You're done.

409
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:40,824
Wait, but I made a list.

410
00:26:40,824 --> 00:26:42,994
Yeah, good, mail it to me, okay?
You're done.

411
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:46,231
All I want for Christmas
is a rock polishing kit.

412
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,864
Rock polishing kit?

413
00:26:48,864 --> 00:26:50,785
You're Santa's favorite.

414
00:26:50,785 --> 00:26:53,986
- What's your name?
- Trudy.

415
00:26:58,212 --> 00:27:01,263
Are you okay?

416
00:27:01,263 --> 00:27:02,313
It's just that..

417
00:27:02,313 --> 00:27:04,904
My wife's name was Trudy.

418
00:27:04,904 --> 00:27:06,917
She was killed by a car bomb.

419
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:10,863
It was under the passenger seat.

420
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:15,581
The whole car exploded.

421
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:26,573
Okay, you're done.
You're done, ho, ho

422
00:27:26,573 --> 00:27:28,418
Let's go.

423
00:27:28,418 --> 00:27:29,982
And what's your name?

424
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:33,194
Dory. / Dory, that's a pretty name.

425
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:36,527
I bet I know what you want
for Christmas.

426
00:27:36,527 --> 00:27:39,418
You want your daddy to come home.

427
00:27:39,418 --> 00:27:42,457
And I wanna help you, but
I have a problem.

428
00:27:42,457 --> 00:27:45,912
I just can't find him.
Do you know where he is?

429
00:27:45,912 --> 00:27:48,980
In a church.

430
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,413
He lives in a church?

431
00:27:51,413 --> 00:27:56,156
- With the 3 ladies out front.
- 3 ladies.

432
00:27:56,699 --> 00:28:00,050
Daddy.

433
00:28:00,244 --> 00:28:01,882
That's him.

434
00:28:02,561 --> 00:28:04,407
That's Prager.

435
00:28:04,655 --> 00:28:07,513
Natalie. / Frank, they're cops.

436
00:28:59,542 --> 00:29:00,805
Clear.

437
00:29:06,224 --> 00:29:07,941
Monk was right.
He's in there.

438
00:29:07,941 --> 00:29:11,423
Three ladies out front,
that was all we needed. / Yes, sir.

439
00:29:11,423 --> 00:29:13,516
He's been living in there
since September.

440
00:29:13,516 --> 00:29:15,954
Been in the room in the basement.
He's going by the name Brad Elliot.

441
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,985
I don't give a rat's ass
what he calls himself.

442
00:29:17,985 --> 00:29:19,398
Let's go get him.

443
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:21,657
Cover the back. Tell the snipers
we're going in on my signal.

444
00:29:21,657 --> 00:29:23,650
Wait, wait.

445
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,394
There's a nun in there.

446
00:29:25,394 --> 00:29:27,657
She won't leave.

447
00:29:28,322 --> 00:29:30,334
- A nun?
- Sounded nice.

448
00:29:30,334 --> 00:29:33,932
She had a nun-y quality.

449
00:29:33,932 --> 00:29:36,889
What did she want, Randy?

450
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:39,675
She just wants to talk to you.

451
00:29:39,675 --> 00:29:43,151
She's afraid you're gonna
rough him up.

452
00:29:48,838 --> 00:29:50,788
Stand down.

453
00:29:51,178 --> 00:29:52,989
Stand down.

454
00:29:53,447 --> 00:29:55,313
No, no, no, stay put.

455
00:29:55,465 --> 00:29:56,560
Hold your positions.

456
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,101
- Stand down.
- Hold your positions.

457
00:30:08,262 --> 00:30:09,380
Captain Stottlemeyer. / Yeah.

458
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,704
I'm sister Heather.

459
00:30:10,704 --> 00:30:12,733
Hi, sister.

460
00:30:12,968 --> 00:30:15,134
- You know why I'm here, right?
- Yes.

461
00:30:15,134 --> 00:30:17,490
He's here.
He's in the sanctuary.

462
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,526
He's very frightened.

463
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,611
You think he tried to murder you?

464
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,148
Yes, ma'am, I do.

465
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,173
You obviously have very strong
feelings about this.

466
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:28,848
You got that..

467
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:30,156
Yes, I do.

468
00:30:30,156 --> 00:30:33,347
I just wanna make sure
that Brad isn't mistreated.

469
00:30:33,347 --> 00:30:35,101
Brad's not his name.

470
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:36,152
You're right.

471
00:30:36,152 --> 00:30:37,636
I don't know his real name.

472
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,291
But I know the man.

473
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:41,058
He's been working in our
outreach program.

474
00:30:41,058 --> 00:30:43,856
He's been feeding the hungry
and homeless every night.

475
00:30:43,856 --> 00:30:46,403
When they're too tired to come here,
he brings the food to them.

476
00:30:46,403 --> 00:30:48,048
Well, maybe he has a guilty conscience.

477
00:30:48,048 --> 00:30:51,625
Well, any conscience at all
is a rare thing these days.

478
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:54,925
What do you want, Captain?

479
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:59,415
I want justice.

480
00:30:59,415 --> 00:31:02,019
Well, he's afraid that you want
something else.

481
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:03,738
He's afraid you and the other
policemen want...

482
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:05,688
Revenge.

483
00:31:06,826 --> 00:31:09,877
My father wants taught me
an important lesson.

484
00:31:09,877 --> 00:31:14,555
There's no revenge so complete
as forgiveness.

485
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:20,642
- Your father.
- He's your father too.

486
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:28,500
Okay, look, I promise you
that I will not hurt him.

487
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,529
Okay.

488
00:31:32,553 --> 00:31:37,438
Frank, there's a clinic
next to the church.

489
00:31:37,806 --> 00:31:41,126
They have drugs, they have chemicals.

490
00:31:41,126 --> 00:31:43,923
Did you have access to the storage room?

491
00:31:43,923 --> 00:31:48,993
Uh huh. I mean,
I didn't have key or anything,

492
00:31:48,993 --> 00:31:52,226
but it would've been easy
enough to break in.

493
00:31:52,226 --> 00:31:55,088
I didn't poison anybody.
I'm not a killer.

494
00:31:55,088 --> 00:31:59,123
Oh, right. What about our last date
in the parking lot 4 months ago?

495
00:31:59,123 --> 00:32:01,079
I wasn't trying to kill you.

496
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:03,405
You can't be serious.

497
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:05,043
All right.

498
00:32:05,043 --> 00:32:06,587
I thought about it.

499
00:32:06,587 --> 00:32:10,673
When I got there, I couldn't.

500
00:32:11,043 --> 00:32:14,280
I didn't want to become my brother.

501
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,825
The last minute, I decided to
send you a message.

502
00:32:16,825 --> 00:32:18,960
A message?

503
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,891
Oh, my god.

504
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,714
Captain, the pattern.

505
00:32:24,665 --> 00:32:27,272
It was M.
M for Michael

506
00:32:27,272 --> 00:32:29,352
Yeah.
It was an M.

507
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:31,732
How could you miss it?

508
00:32:31,732 --> 00:32:36,783
Well, how was I supposed
to know that was the letter M?

509
00:32:36,783 --> 00:32:39,140
This guy's the best detective
in the free world.

510
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,699
He didn't know that was an M.

511
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:45,959
What, you couldn't use
a spray can like everyvody else?

512
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:48,236
Oh, for god's sake, a message.

513
00:32:48,236 --> 00:32:51,724
I just wanted you to think about
what you did.

514
00:32:51,724 --> 00:32:56,647
Michael was a good kid
who got screwed up.

515
00:33:00,205 --> 00:33:02,513
Wait, you think I don't think
about your brother?

516
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:06,039
I think about your brother
every damn day of my life.

517
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:09,378
It was him or me.

518
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:11,247
And it still eats me up.

519
00:33:11,247 --> 00:33:16,362
I don't need an M on a wall
to remember something like that.

520
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:19,276
No cop does.

521
00:33:22,256 --> 00:33:24,479
Get him out of here.

522
00:33:24,674 --> 00:33:26,155
Let's go.

523
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:30,417
God, Captain, you gotta read this.

524
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:33,079
This is from the journal he kept
while he was in that church.

525
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:35,334
He feels terrible about what he did.
Look at this one part.

526
00:33:35,334 --> 00:33:37,741
- It made me cry.
- He can't see it.

527
00:33:37,741 --> 00:33:40,881
Yeah, I know, Natalie.
He's not the guy, all right?

528
00:33:40,881 --> 00:33:42,338
Okay, moving on, Lieutenant,

529
00:33:42,338 --> 00:33:45,432
you said there were 4 other
suspects who might've had a motive.

530
00:33:45,432 --> 00:33:47,566
Actually, we struck out.

531
00:33:47,566 --> 00:33:52,492
One's deceased, one's in a hospital
and two are back in prison.

532
00:33:52,492 --> 00:33:55,660
Okay. So it wasn't Frank Prager.
It's nobody on your list.

533
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,775
Who sent me that bottle of wine?

534
00:33:57,775 --> 00:34:00,316
And will they try again?

535
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:03,044
To kill you, I mean.

536
00:34:03,044 --> 00:34:05,801
I know what you mean, Lieutenant.

537
00:34:16,403 --> 00:34:19,191
Let's see.
It looks good.

538
00:34:19,513 --> 00:34:22,454
You need one, too.

539
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:29,313
Okay, this is from Mr. Monk.

540
00:34:29,313 --> 00:34:31,909
You didn't have to get me anything.

541
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,104
Thanks.

542
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,889
Don't tear..

543
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:40,426
- First Aid kit.
- That is the hot gift this year.

544
00:34:40,426 --> 00:34:42,803
It's the Cadillac of first aid kits.

545
00:34:42,803 --> 00:34:48,300
I'm talking about 100 feed of gauze,
5 different ointments, and a tourniquet.

546
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,029
- Now that tourniquet...
- Okay, that's great.
We're gonna look at that later,

547
00:34:51,029 --> 00:34:54,783
because this is from both of us.

548
00:34:54,783 --> 00:34:57,451
Be careful, those are fragile.

549
00:35:08,986 --> 00:35:11,742
It's alive.
It's a living thing.

550
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,542
Is it gonna die?

551
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:16,589
Well, not for a long long long time.

552
00:35:16,589 --> 00:35:18,663
- But it'll die eventually.
- It's a friend.

553
00:35:18,663 --> 00:35:21,652
- It's a little friend to keep you company.
- A dying friend.

554
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,480
Look at it.
It's just twitching, it's turning.

555
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,201
Left, then it swims right.

556
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:28,190
It's zigzaging.
Can we train it?

557
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:31,043
Yeah, we can train it.
To swim clockwise.

558
00:35:31,043 --> 00:35:33,280
And I can show you how to feed this.

559
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,863
Okay, wait.
Stay there.

560
00:35:34,863 --> 00:35:35,927
- It's okay.
- I'll get it.

561
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:38,422
- It's okay.
- My new broom.

562
00:35:38,422 --> 00:35:40,126
Just wait.

563
00:36:01,755 --> 00:36:05,320
Captain. / Merry Christmas Alice.

564
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,691
May we come in?

565
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,250
So what's going on?

566
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:14,528
Monk thinks that he knows who
tried to kill me during the Christmas party.

567
00:36:14,528 --> 00:36:16,087
I heard it was Frank Prager.

568
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:18,034
No, it wasn't Prager.

569
00:36:18,034 --> 00:36:19,516
In fact, it wasn't anybody.

570
00:36:19,516 --> 00:36:24,068
Nobody tried to kill the captain.
That was a trick to throw us off track.

571
00:36:24,068 --> 00:36:26,185
Terry Chasen was the target.

572
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:27,520
From the beginning.

573
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,029
Alice, we know you and Terry
were involved.

574
00:36:30,029 --> 00:36:32,469
We've got phone records,
credit cards.

575
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:35,205
You were together for
about 6 months. / 7.

576
00:36:35,205 --> 00:36:36,347
7 months.

577
00:36:36,347 --> 00:36:41,805
Was it because he went back to his wife?
That's why you killed him?

578
00:36:41,805 --> 00:36:43,667
Alice.

579
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:47,053
We know how you did it.

580
00:36:47,251 --> 00:36:49,453
The Christmas gift exchange
was your idea.

581
00:36:49,453 --> 00:36:52,718
It was easy to make sure that
the captain picked Terry's name.

582
00:36:52,718 --> 00:36:57,666
Yeah, I remember. I was the last one to
choose and there was one name left.

583
00:36:57,666 --> 00:37:00,625
The day of the party, you brought
poisoned bottle into the office.

584
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,315
You dropped it off at the front desk.

585
00:37:02,315 --> 00:37:04,666
It was addressed to Captain Stottlemeyer.

586
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:07,267
And you know I don't drink port.

587
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,563
And at some point,
probably during the party,

588
00:37:09,563 --> 00:37:12,790
you snuck into the captain's office
and you stole the gift

589
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,842
that he had brought in for Terry.

590
00:37:14,842 --> 00:37:18,900
And the captain couldn't find it,
you suggested replacing it with the bottle.

591
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,317
The poisoned bottle.

592
00:37:20,317 --> 00:37:22,510
It was like a magician doing
sleight of hand.

593
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:25,674
You had everybody looking
the wrong way.

594
00:37:25,674 --> 00:37:30,018
It was brilliant.

595
00:37:32,573 --> 00:37:34,910
Excuse me.

596
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,449
Alice.

597
00:37:48,778 --> 00:37:50,610
Alice.

598
00:37:50,784 --> 00:37:52,904
Where's the poison?

599
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:55,294
You know, if you threw it away,
we'll find traces of it.

600
00:37:55,294 --> 00:37:58,392
You know that.

601
00:38:01,586 --> 00:38:05,071
It's in the basement.

602
00:38:05,995 --> 00:38:07,552
How did you know?

603
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:09,711
Natalie.

604
00:38:12,253 --> 00:38:16,701
This is the card and the enveloppe.
It came with the whisk broom

605
00:38:16,701 --> 00:38:19,156
which by the way I've been using.
It really is fantastic.

606
00:38:19,156 --> 00:38:22,080
But the card is a little too big.

607
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,730
See, you had to fold it over.

608
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:32,154
This card came with the poisoned bottle.
It's too small.

609
00:38:32,154 --> 00:38:34,390
Alice, you mixed them up.

610
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:37,004
I mixed them up.

611
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:41,517
And I'm usually so organized.

612
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,876
I couldn't...

613
00:38:51,022 --> 00:38:54,834
I just couldn't live without him.

614
00:39:11,805 --> 00:39:13,383
I got it.

615
00:39:13,383 --> 00:39:14,879
Thanks.

616
00:39:16,502 --> 00:39:19,004
I talked to the DA.
She's gonna offer you a deal.

617
00:39:19,004 --> 00:39:22,831
8 months plus time served
on the assault.

618
00:39:24,419 --> 00:39:26,558
Think about it.

619
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:30,447
And you can decide
when you get back.

620
00:39:30,447 --> 00:39:32,743
Where am I going?

621
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,917
You are released on your own
recognizance for two days.

622
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:37,818
Now, I'm responsible for you.

623
00:39:37,818 --> 00:39:40,924
So don't make me regret it.

624
00:39:51,232 --> 00:39:53,546
Go home.

625
00:40:30,406 --> 00:40:32,202
Aren't you curious?

626
00:40:32,202 --> 00:40:33,438
No.

627
00:40:33,438 --> 00:40:35,771
I love not knowing.

628
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:38,262
Oh, my god.
Come on.

629
00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:41,465
Julie, sweetie, what is it?

630
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:56,899
It's a white Christmas.
It's your white Christmas. Yay.

631
00:40:56,899 --> 00:40:58,688
I'm gonna go get my camera.

632
00:40:58,688 --> 00:41:00,862
