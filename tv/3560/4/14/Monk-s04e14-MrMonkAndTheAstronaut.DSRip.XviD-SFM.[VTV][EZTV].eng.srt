1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,839
The countdown is underway
here at Edwards air force base.

2
00:00:03,874 --> 00:00:08,523
The new experimental rocket plane which
was developed by Altman aerodynamics

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,578
is scheduled to launch tomorrow
morning at 7:30 Pacific time.

4
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:15,399
The four man crew will be lead
by a familiar face.

5
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:18,657
Astronaut and civilian test pilot
Steven Wagner.

6
00:00:18,692 --> 00:00:21,327
Wagner became a national hero
four years ago

7
00:00:21,362 --> 00:00:23,582
when he made a courageous
emergency landing

8
00:00:23,617 --> 00:00:25,568
in the space shuttle during reentry.

9
00:00:25,603 --> 00:00:28,849
A national hero
in my very own living room.

10
00:00:28,884 --> 00:00:30,656
But I'll never be a hero to you, will I?

11
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:32,380
You were once.

12
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:34,569
Is this it?

13
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:39,370
Between the sheets:
The Joanne Raphelson story.

14
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:41,268
You want to read it?
You're chapter five.

15
00:00:41,303 --> 00:00:43,102
- How many chapters are there?
- 15.

16
00:00:43,137 --> 00:00:46,515
Wow, you've been a busy girl, Joanne.

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,068
And that's only volume one.

18
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:51,161
You really went into detail?

19
00:00:51,196 --> 00:00:54,119
My editor insisted on it.
The juicier, the better.

20
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:58,297
That's why I called you, Steve.
I didn't want you to be surprised.

21
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:01,504
I appreciate that, Joanne.

22
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:05,352
I really do.

23
00:01:06,548 --> 00:01:10,514
So has anyone seen
this new version yet?

24
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:12,177
Not yet.

25
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:13,505
When do you hand it in?

26
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,558
Next week.
I'm still proofreading it.

27
00:01:15,593 --> 00:01:17,144
Cheers.

28
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:23,798
An olive, a cherry, and an onion.
What do you call this?

29
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,944
A spacewalk. It's my own recipe.

30
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,553
It's a good name.

31
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,574
Feel like I'm flying.

32
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:32,360
So do you want to read it?

33
00:01:32,395 --> 00:01:35,574
I plan to.
That's why I'm here but...

34
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:37,457
I've changed my mind.

35
00:01:37,492 --> 00:01:39,870
Hell, I've been a test pilot for 15 years.

36
00:01:39,905 --> 00:01:42,586
I once landed a space shuttle
in the ocean.

37
00:01:42,621 --> 00:01:45,497
I think I can handle
whatever's in chapter five.

38
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:47,871
So hand it in.
Hit me with your best shot.

39
00:01:47,906 --> 00:01:49,838
Thank you, Steve.

40
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:58,233
Sir, there's a rumor you might be
considering a run for senate.

41
00:01:58,268 --> 00:02:00,038
I don't know.
I've been to Washington.

42
00:02:00,073 --> 00:02:02,884
- Look at you.
- I think I'm a lot safer in outer space.

43
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:04,389
Damn, you're cute.

44
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:07,412
Seriously, after this mission, I'm going to
sit down and review my options.

45
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:08,753
But I will say this.

46
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:12,162
If I choose to run for public office,
I'll treat it like any other mission.

47
00:02:12,197 --> 00:02:14,891
I will fully commit and I will win.

48
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,015
Failure is not an option.

49
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,818
MONK Season 4 Epi. 14
Mr. Monk and the Astronaut

50
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:23,431
Hello, Miss Raphelson.

51
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:26,118
Miss Raphelson, I see your car.

52
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:29,311
Miss Raphelson?

53
00:03:31,157 --> 00:03:32,046
Madre de dios!

54
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:34,256
Madre de dios, Miss Raphelson!

55
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,359
Madre de dios!

56
00:03:39,046 --> 00:03:41,619
Career day.

57
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,457
What would I talk about?

58
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:46,624
Your career. Your job.

59
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:48,703
Oh, come on, Mr. Monk.
It would mean so much to Julie.

60
00:03:48,738 --> 00:03:50,291
Yeah. I can't do it.

61
00:03:50,326 --> 00:03:52,728
I'm sorry. I can't speak in public.

62
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:53,941
See, that's not true.

63
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:55,548
Remember when I first
started working for you

64
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,985
and you made that list
of all your fears and phobias.

65
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,589
There were 103 things.
Public speaking wasn't one of them.

66
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:03,731
Actually, there were a couple of things
that I didn't mention.

67
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:05,475
I didn't want you to think I was weird.

68
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,223
Why don't you ask the captain?

69
00:04:07,258 --> 00:04:11,108
Whatever it is, thank you for asking,
but I can't do it.

70
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,344
Luckyful though, dawg.

71
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:18,025
The housekeeper has her own key.
She comes in every other week.

72
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,415
She found the body
right here a couple hours ago.

73
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:24,902
Her name is, uh, Joanne Raphelson.
36. Former Vegas showgirl.

74
00:04:24,937 --> 00:04:26,864
And the coroner just took the body.

75
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:31,376
Said she's been dead for five days.
So that makes it, uh...

76
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:34,240
- Wednesday morning.
- Wednesday.

77
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:37,272
Excuse me. Why are we here?
She killed herself, right?

78
00:04:37,307 --> 00:04:40,176
Uh, maybe.
I'm not sure.

79
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:43,491
I noticed a few things.
I wanted to run them by you.

80
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:49,378
Found a letter from a publisher
in New York.

81
00:04:49,413 --> 00:04:52,578
She was about to have
a book published.

82
00:04:52,722 --> 00:04:57,492
A memoir called, "Between the sheets:
The Joanne Raphelson story."

83
00:04:57,527 --> 00:04:59,517
Between the...

84
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:02,305
Oh, yeah. I get it.

85
00:05:02,697 --> 00:05:07,037
And a check for 50 grand,
which she has not deposited.

86
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:09,548
Pretty weird time to hang yourself, huh?

87
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:10,928
Good work, sir.

88
00:05:10,963 --> 00:05:13,528
You don't have to sound
so surprised, Randy.

89
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,015
Oh, I'm not surprised.

90
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,707
Awestruck.

91
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:22,045
- Awestruck.
- Well, don't be.

92
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,950
And that's an order. - You're ordering
me not to be awestruck?

93
00:05:23,985 --> 00:05:27,308
That's right. Stand over there
and don't be awestruck.

94
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:29,037
Sir.

95
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:33,351
Anything else?

96
00:05:33,386 --> 00:05:35,436
Uh, yeah. Looks like
her computer's missing.

97
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:40,000
There's a power strip with a surge
protector, a printer, and no computer.

98
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:41,542
Excuse me, sir.

99
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:46,129
Sorry. I've never disobeyed
an order in my life.

100
00:05:46,164 --> 00:05:47,446
It's really good work.
It's awesome.

101
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:50,539
Randy, why don't you go outside
and talk to the neighbors?

102
00:05:50,574 --> 00:05:52,050
Yes, sir.

103
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:54,800
It's awesome.

104
00:05:56,179 --> 00:06:00,490
So am I right?
Something's not kosher?

105
00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:08,568
It's her driver's license.

106
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:11,522
How tall do you think that stool is?

107
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,293
About 18 inches.

108
00:06:17,315 --> 00:06:20,610
The rope's 7'6".

109
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:24,794
But according to her license,
she's only 5'5".

110
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:27,079
I'm 5'5".

111
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:31,084
Step up.

112
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:36,177
You're right.

113
00:06:37,074 --> 00:06:39,435
It doesn't add up.

114
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:42,619
So how long have you lived here?

115
00:06:42,654 --> 00:06:45,483
15 years. Maybe 14.
You know what?

116
00:06:45,518 --> 00:06:48,385
My old lady would know that.
You can ask her when she gets back.

117
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,312
If she's sober.

118
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:52,012
Hey, you want one of these?

119
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:54,021
Nectarines. They're the perfect fruit.

120
00:06:54,056 --> 00:06:55,966
Okay. - There you go.

121
00:06:56,606 --> 00:06:59,619
Now why is the garage door
open again?

122
00:06:59,654 --> 00:07:01,842
Benny, what'd I tell you about this?

123
00:07:01,877 --> 00:07:03,882
- I didn't open it.
- Really. Well, then who did?

124
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:05,840
Maybe Donna did it.
You ever think of that?

125
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,120
You know what? Your sister
couldn't open up a box of crayons.

126
00:07:08,155 --> 00:07:10,524
She's six years old, for god.

127
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:13,368
Mr. Cain, I just have a few more questions.

128
00:07:13,403 --> 00:07:15,116
How well did you know Ms. Raphelson?

129
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:18,653
Not as well as I wanted to,
if you get my drift.

130
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,638
Hey, she was hot.

131
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,876
What a waste.

132
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:25,197
Did she have any visitors last week?

133
00:07:25,232 --> 00:07:27,234
Say Tuesday or Wednesday?

134
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:29,064
No. Nobody. Nobody.

135
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,248
Not as far as I recall anyway.

136
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:33,805
Oh, for, not a...
Hector's out!

137
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,833
Benny, could you,
go get your dog, please.

138
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:39,834
- Why should I?
- Because you opened up the garage.

139
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:43,245
Hey, smart guy.
This is a police officer, right?

140
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,587
I could have him lock you up.

141
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:47,155
You think about that.

142
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,704
- How's it going?
- Captain.

143
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:51,172
This is, uh, Darrel Cain.

144
00:07:51,207 --> 00:07:54,812
Darrel Cain, captain Leland Stottlemeyer.
Natalie Teeger. Adrian Monk.

145
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:56,063
Hi.

146
00:07:56,215 --> 00:08:00,064
Mr. Cain says he was home last week.
But he didn't see anything. - Excuse me.

147
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:04,206
That box is addressed
to Joanne Raphelson.

148
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:07,456
Yeah. It was on her porch.

149
00:08:08,462 --> 00:08:11,112
Well, I'd heard she died.
I figured it was up for grabs.

150
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:13,857
You can't just take mail
from somebody's porch.

151
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:16,276
Yeah, you can if it's fruit.

152
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:19,148
Law doesn't apply to fruit
because it's perishable.

153
00:08:19,183 --> 00:08:22,926
Actually, sir,
the law does apply to fruit.

154
00:08:23,774 --> 00:08:25,583
Are you eating one?

155
00:08:25,618 --> 00:08:27,454
No. I was just putting that back.

156
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:31,083
Captain, you wanted to see
her phone record. - Yeah.

157
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:35,528
No calls at all on Tuesday or Monday?

158
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:41,351
Last call she made was
Saturday morning at 2:05 A. M.

159
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:50,157
Hello. This is captain Leland Stottlemeyer,
San Francisco police.

160
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:52,155
Who's this?

161
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:04,412
Captain Stottlemeyer?

162
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,115
Yeah. Hey.

163
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,178
- Is this a bad time?
- Oh. No. No.

164
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:12,186
Some friends are throwing me
a little party. It's sort of a tradition.

165
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:14,099
Congratulations on your flight.

166
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:17,900
Hey, and, uh, congratulations
on that crash landing four years ago.

167
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:20,376
Oh, and, uh, marrying the figure skater.

168
00:09:20,411 --> 00:09:23,360
Yeah, congratulations on your
whole damn life.

169
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:27,605
This is lieutenant Disher,
Natalie Teeger, and Adrian Monk.

170
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,529
Monk. I know that name.

171
00:09:29,564 --> 00:09:31,405
You're the detective.

172
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,495
The one who quit.

173
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,950
I, I, I didn't quit, exactly.

174
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:38,141
It was, it was a leave of absence.

175
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:39,770
It's nothing to be ashamed of, Mr. Monk.

176
00:09:39,805 --> 00:09:41,847
Some people just can't
handle the pressure.

177
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,654
I didn't quit.

178
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:45,213
Mr. Wagner, I'm sorry.

179
00:09:45,248 --> 00:09:47,810
My daughter just wrote
a school paper about you.

180
00:09:47,845 --> 00:09:50,286
Good. I need all the P. R. I can get.

181
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:53,093
She's not gonna believe that I met you.
Do you mind if I take a picture?

182
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:54,608
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

183
00:09:54,643 --> 00:09:57,070
I'm not, I'm not a quitter.
I didn't quit.

184
00:09:57,105 --> 00:10:00,200
- There were extenuating circumstances.
- There always are.

185
00:10:00,235 --> 00:10:03,513
The trick is not to let them stop us.

186
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:06,074
Captain, you said it was important.

187
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:07,853
Oh, yeah. Um...

188
00:10:08,438 --> 00:10:11,900
Do you know a woman named
Joanne Raphelson?

189
00:10:12,406 --> 00:10:14,872
She's dead, isn't she?

190
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,760
She finally did it.

191
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:21,072
You're not surprised.

192
00:10:21,341 --> 00:10:24,542
Joanne's been depressed for months.
For years, really.

193
00:10:24,577 --> 00:10:27,681
She was about to have a book published
but somehow that made it worse.

194
00:10:27,716 --> 00:10:30,979
Like I was saying, Mr. Monk,
some people just can't handle the pressure.

195
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:33,233
It was a psychological discharge,
for god's sake.

196
00:10:33,268 --> 00:10:34,975
- It was only temporary.
- I plan on being reinstated.

197
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,418
- He's so much better.
- How well did you know her?

198
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:40,427
Intimately.

199
00:10:40,462 --> 00:10:44,197
- When was the last time you saw her?
- Five years ago.

200
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:47,198
No, wait, she called you
on the phone last week.

201
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:49,275
That's true.
She calls me once or twice a year

202
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:53,234
when she's lonely, depressed,
or drunk, and sometimes all three.

203
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:54,922
Steven?

204
00:10:54,957 --> 00:10:57,351
- Honey, we're cutting the cake.
- Hey, look, uh,

205
00:10:57,386 --> 00:10:59,159
we could talk about this tomorrow, okay?

206
00:10:59,194 --> 00:11:01,407
That's all right, captain.
I have no secrets from my wife.

207
00:11:01,442 --> 00:11:04,040
Honey, these gentlemen are detectives.

208
00:11:04,075 --> 00:11:06,094
Joanne Raphelson is dead.

209
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:08,722
Oh, no. Poor girl.

210
00:11:08,757 --> 00:11:12,023
I made a mistake, captain.
Five years ago.

211
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:14,238
Nicole knows all about it.

212
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,884
I don't deserve this woman.

213
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:20,251
Excuse me, ma'am.
What is that you're drinking?

214
00:11:20,286 --> 00:11:24,674
It's called a spacewalk.
My husband invented it.

215
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:26,598
Is, is that an olive?

216
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:28,563
And an onion and a cherry.

217
00:11:28,598 --> 00:11:30,639
It's my claim to fame.
Would you like one?

218
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:32,154
No, thank you.

219
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:34,168
Mr. Wagner, I was reading
about your flight and

220
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:36,189
they said they almost
had to cancel the liftoff.

221
00:11:36,224 --> 00:11:37,920
- You were running late.
- That's true.

222
00:11:37,955 --> 00:11:41,158
I got lost on my way to Edwards.
Can you believe it?

223
00:11:41,193 --> 00:11:43,849
- You, you got lost?
- I tried a different short cut.

224
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:48,420
I, I, I guess I'm a better navigator
in the sky than I am on the highways.

225
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:51,367
Congressman, glad you
could make it. - Steve.

226
00:11:51,402 --> 00:11:53,475
Hey, when are we gonna have
that talk about your future?

227
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,392
The sooner, the better.

228
00:11:56,222 --> 00:11:58,864
Will you excuse us?
My friends are waiting.

229
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:00,519
We can talk about this
some other time. - Absolutely.

230
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,158
Great. - It was nice to meet you.

231
00:12:02,193 --> 00:12:03,847
Nice to meet you.

232
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:07,359
He's the guy.

233
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:11,618
- Who's the guy?
- The astronaut.

234
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:13,665
He killed her.

235
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,831
Somebody made that exact same drink at
Joanne Raphelson's house before she died.

236
00:12:17,866 --> 00:12:20,702
Monk, it's not possible.
He was in space.

237
00:12:20,737 --> 00:12:22,438
He did it.

238
00:12:22,473 --> 00:12:24,802
Outer space, Monk.

239
00:12:24,837 --> 00:12:28,158
He was on TV.
He was orbiting the Earth.

240
00:12:28,193 --> 00:12:31,102
Gotta admit, it's a pretty good alibi.

241
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,417
He, he's the guy.

242
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:50,167
Monk, 99 times out of 100,
I am in your corner.

243
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:54,062
But I just can't see it.
Steve Wagner is a national hero.

244
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:55,705
It's true, Mr. Monk.

245
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,298
He was on the cover of Time magazine.

246
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,436
- Actually, it was Newsweek.
- Actually, it was both.

247
00:13:00,471 --> 00:13:02,736
Now look, we need to tread carefully here.

248
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:05,486
First off, there's no motive.
The wife knew about the affair.

249
00:13:05,521 --> 00:13:08,054
- A lot of people did.
- It wasn't just the affair.

250
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:10,957
We just talked to Joanne Raphelson's
editor in New York.

251
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:16,296
She was about to hand in her next draft,
which contained a couple of real bombshells.

252
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:20,224
Like? - Like which of her ex-boyfriends
beat her up five years ago.

253
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:22,336
Somebody put her in the hospital.

254
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:25,333
She had a concussion, right?

255
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,916
And you think Steve Wagner's involved?

256
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:33,083
I just don't believe it.
I'm sorry, Mr. Monk.

257
00:13:34,087 --> 00:13:36,627
Look, Wagner wants to run for office.

258
00:13:36,662 --> 00:13:39,438
A story like that would bury him.

259
00:13:39,473 --> 00:13:42,649
Okay. Maybe you found
a motive. Maybe.

260
00:13:42,684 --> 00:13:45,126
But it doesn't matter.
And I'll tell you why.

261
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:48,814
Because your suspect, Monk,
was in outer space.

262
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:50,682
- He wasn't on this planet.
- It's true.

263
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:53,873
- Julie and I watched it on television.
- The whole world was watching.

264
00:13:53,908 --> 00:13:57,404
He took off on Monday
and he landed on Friday.

265
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:59,124
Here's the case file.

266
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:01,451
The coroner is 100% sure.

267
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:04,839
He is certain that Joanne Raphelson
died of ligature strangulation

268
00:14:04,874 --> 00:14:09,571
on Wednesday morning
while your man was in space.

269
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:14,925
Now maybe we should take a minute
and see if we can think of a better alibi.

270
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:41,241
- It's a pretty good alibi.
- Yeah.

271
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:43,913
She had drugs in her system?
Barbiturates.

272
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:46,431
Yeah, coroner says she took some pills.
They didn't work.

273
00:14:46,466 --> 00:14:49,409
She went to plan B and dangled herself.
It happens all the time.

274
00:14:49,444 --> 00:14:52,543
But you said yourself
the crime scene didn't look kosher.

275
00:14:52,578 --> 00:14:57,260
Monk, what I'm saying is it might
be murder, but it wasn't him.

276
00:14:57,295 --> 00:14:58,707
Captain.

277
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:02,149
- I think Monk's right.
- Thank you. Reinforcements.

278
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:04,124
I think I know how Wagner did it.

279
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,308
Okay. This is the ship.

280
00:15:06,343 --> 00:15:08,798
And let's pretend this globe
represents the Earth.

281
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:12,011
That's a globe.
It does represent the Earth.

282
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:13,473
Right.

283
00:15:13,764 --> 00:15:16,420
Okay. Here's what happened.

284
00:15:16,455 --> 00:15:19,755
First part was easy.
He takes off.

285
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:32,250
As he passes over San Francisco,
he activates the escape pod.

286
00:15:32,285 --> 00:15:34,459
Well, wait. Uh, wait.

287
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:36,637
Uh, was, was there
an escape pod on the ship?

288
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:38,251
No. Not officially.

289
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:39,808
But I think he smuggled one on.

290
00:15:39,843 --> 00:15:42,759
And where did he get it,
the escape pod?

291
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:47,027
- He built it.
- Yeah. Out of a kit in his basement.

292
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:50,291
He's resourceful.
Anyway...

293
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:52,433
splashdown.

294
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:54,846
He climbs out of the pod,
makes his way to her house,

295
00:15:54,881 --> 00:16:00,105
kills her, climbs back onto the pod,
fires up the engines, back in space.

296
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:02,532
Thank you, Randy.

297
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:05,679
- It's just a theory.
- I don't think so.

298
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:09,362
No. I've heard theories before and, uh,

299
00:16:09,397 --> 00:16:12,013
they don't sound like that.

300
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,439
It's him.

301
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:18,449
It's Steve Wagner.

302
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,833
Hello?

303
00:16:21,223 --> 00:16:22,761
Yes.

304
00:16:24,758 --> 00:16:26,304
Really?

305
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:29,143
Oh, that's wonderful.

306
00:16:29,634 --> 00:16:32,515
Uh, tomorrow morning at 10 A. M.

307
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,026
Oh, the kids are gonna be so thrilled.

308
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,431
Okay, great. I'll see you then.

309
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:41,267
Steve Wagner is speaking
at Julie's school for career day.

310
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:42,783
Wait, you invited him?

311
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:45,704
Yeah. I met his PR person last night
as we were leaving.

312
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,944
Natalie, he killed his ex-girlfriend.

313
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:51,770
Monk, maybe you should go, too.

314
00:16:51,805 --> 00:16:56,069
You think the guy's involved,
it'll give you a chance to feel him out.

315
00:16:57,685 --> 00:17:01,036
Fine.
Okay. I'll do it.

316
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:04,415
You're both coming?

317
00:17:04,664 --> 00:17:07,391
I'm gonna be class mom of the year.

318
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:11,004
When I was your age,
I was a boy scout.

319
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,294
Who here knows the boy scout motto?

320
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:14,900
Be prepared.

321
00:17:14,935 --> 00:17:17,588
That's right.
And that motto saved my life.

322
00:17:17,623 --> 00:17:20,792
Because when the landing gear
didn't come down, I was prepared.

323
00:17:20,827 --> 00:17:22,890
I knew what I had to do.

324
00:17:23,594 --> 00:17:26,239
I went around Florida.
Good-bye, Florida.

325
00:17:26,274 --> 00:17:29,684
Over Louisiana. And landed
the space shuttle here

326
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:33,094
in the gulf of Mexico
with a great bigbelly flop.

327
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:36,299
- And you weren't even scared?
- No, I wasn't scared.

328
00:17:36,334 --> 00:17:38,259
I was terrified!

329
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,843
People called me a hero.

330
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:44,490
But anyone, anybody could've done that.

331
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:46,780
You or you,

332
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,521
or you or you or...

333
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:54,016
you or you.

334
00:17:55,096 --> 00:17:59,696
Being brave is being afraid of something
but doing it anyway.

335
00:18:00,734 --> 00:18:02,231
What are you gonna do next?

336
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:07,152
Well, tomorrow, I'm testing a brand-new jet
for the air force called the FA-22 raptor.

337
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,450
It's the most advanced fighter
in the world.

338
00:18:09,485 --> 00:18:11,409
She's faster than the speed of sound.

339
00:18:11,444 --> 00:18:16,223
So if you hear a big boom in the sky
tomorrow, that's me saying hello, kids.

340
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,472
Before I go,

341
00:18:18,507 --> 00:18:22,471
I brought some official Steve Wagner
laser pointers for all you kids.

342
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:24,960
Here you go.
Take one, pass them back.

343
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:27,184
Well, I had a great time.

344
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:30,215
And remember, what does
Steve Wagner want you to do?

345
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,695
Aim high.

346
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,254
Right there.

347
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:37,453
Thank you so much, Mr. Wagner.
Wasn't he great?

348
00:18:37,488 --> 00:18:39,201
Let's give him a hand.

349
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:41,206
Thank you.

350
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:45,244
Okay, so Julie's next guest is
Mr. Adrian Monk, who's also my boss.

351
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:47,215
So, everybody, be extra nice.

352
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,166
He's going to talk about what it's like
to be a police detective.

353
00:18:55,622 --> 00:18:57,246
Hi.

354
00:19:02,153 --> 00:19:03,742
Hi, I'm...

355
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:05,305
I'm, um...

356
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,245
I'm...

357
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:24,613
Leave it.

358
00:19:30,381 --> 00:19:32,210
I'm, uh...

359
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:37,075
I'm Adrian Monk.

360
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:41,830
Who wants to be a detective
when they grow up?

361
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:48,935
What about you?

362
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,651
No?

363
00:19:51,353 --> 00:19:55,166
Everybody in your row
has their hand up.

364
00:19:57,153 --> 00:20:00,078
If you put your hand up...

365
00:20:00,113 --> 00:20:02,808
it would be a perfect row.

366
00:20:05,863 --> 00:20:08,017
Put your hand up!

367
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:16,161
Where's your gun?

368
00:20:16,196 --> 00:20:18,323
Um, I, uh,

369
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:20,728
I don't have, I don't have one.

370
00:20:20,763 --> 00:20:23,835
You can't carry one
'cause you had a breakdown.

371
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:26,917
Oh, well, uh...

372
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:30,583
Julie says you're afraid of milk.

373
00:20:30,618 --> 00:20:33,795
Well, everybody's afraid
of something, right?

374
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,109
Julie said you're afraid of everything.

375
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:39,157
Mr. Monk, I really, I'm...

376
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:41,844
Have you ever caught a real killer?

377
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:44,531
Oh, yes. Oh...

378
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:47,900
Yes, I've caught a lot of killers.

379
00:20:47,935 --> 00:20:50,347
Some killers are very smart.

380
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,632
And some are very powerful.

381
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:58,682
Some are even famous.
They don't think they will ever be caught.

382
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:01,836
But in the end,

383
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:05,017
they, they're always caught.

384
00:21:05,052 --> 00:21:07,518
And I'll tell you why.

385
00:21:08,255 --> 00:21:14,291
Because the police can make mistakes.

386
00:21:14,326 --> 00:21:18,093
I make mistakes all the time.

387
00:21:18,128 --> 00:21:20,720
But, uh, but...

388
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:30,357
see, a killer has to be, uh...

389
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,611
A killer has to be perfect.
And, uh...

390
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:45,892
nobody's perfect.

391
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:57,971
The first police officers appeared
in Ancient Rome in 200 B. C.

392
00:21:58,006 --> 00:22:01,048
They were called centurions.

393
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,755
In many ways, they were like
our modern police force.

394
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,847
It was their job to, to...

395
00:22:07,787 --> 00:22:10,860
to enforce laws and to...

396
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:12,996
to maintain order.

397
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:17,397
They were, uh,
chosen for their...

398
00:22:18,548 --> 00:22:22,503
their loyalty and their courage.

399
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,142
Here, Mr. Monk.

400
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:35,816
Drink that.
Are you okay?

401
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,618
That was a good, good speech.

402
00:22:40,653 --> 00:22:43,265
I think the kids learned a lot.

403
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,550
Are they still laughing?

404
00:22:45,585 --> 00:22:47,388
They'll have to stop soon.

405
00:22:47,423 --> 00:22:49,208
The period's almost over.

406
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,338
I am such a...

407
00:22:51,373 --> 00:22:53,623
- What do you call it?
- Wuss.

408
00:22:53,658 --> 00:22:56,785
No, Mr. Monk, you are not a wuss.

409
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,391
Well, I'm not a man.
I know that.

410
00:22:59,426 --> 00:23:01,269
I'm a mutant.

411
00:23:01,304 --> 00:23:05,010
I'm half man, half wuss.
I'm a muss.

412
00:23:05,045 --> 00:23:07,787
Here you are. Our brave centurion.
I liked your speech.

413
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:09,506
Especially the little dance number
at the end.

414
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:11,649
Those laser pointers
can be very dangerous.

415
00:23:11,684 --> 00:23:14,446
Yeah. They're a real menace.
I hear you've been checking up on me.

416
00:23:14,481 --> 00:23:17,105
Calling Joanne's family.
Her publisher. Turning over rocks.

417
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,288
If you want to talk to me,
let's talk right now, man to muss.

418
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,114
- Did you hit her?
- Hit who?

419
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:31,774
Joanne. Did you hit her so hard
that she woke up in the hospital?

420
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:33,847
I wouldn't repeat that, Mr. Monk.
That's slander.

421
00:23:33,882 --> 00:23:37,178
Besides, who would believe it?

422
00:23:37,213 --> 00:23:39,876
That's why you killed her, isn't it?

423
00:23:39,911 --> 00:23:42,471
Because she was about to go public.

424
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:46,335
She was about to tell the truth
about you.

425
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:49,582
You're a sad little man. I can't believe
you and I breathe the same air.

426
00:23:49,617 --> 00:23:51,496
I was on a space ship, Mr. Monk,

427
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:54,204
circling the Earth with my crew.

428
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:57,038
Why doesn't that satisfy?

429
00:23:57,073 --> 00:24:00,197
Am I making you nervous?

430
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:02,061
Never.

431
00:24:02,096 --> 00:24:03,822
You know why?

432
00:24:04,614 --> 00:24:06,923
See? You flinched.

433
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:09,243
See, you're a flincher.

434
00:24:10,175 --> 00:24:11,822
You'll never stop me

435
00:24:11,857 --> 00:24:14,432
because when the chips
are down when it really counts,

436
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:17,869
you are always going to flinch.

437
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:22,067
Sir, sorry to interrupt.
We have to go.

438
00:24:22,102 --> 00:24:25,140
Would you excuse us?
The governor's waiting.

439
00:24:29,491 --> 00:24:33,353
My god. You were right.

440
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,184
He killed her.

441
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:38,186
That was almost a confession.

442
00:24:38,472 --> 00:24:40,135
But how?

443
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,862
How did he do it?

444
00:24:47,908 --> 00:24:52,256
And they were just toys.
Little red flashlights.

445
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:55,228
But I was terrified.

446
00:24:55,263 --> 00:24:57,619
I wanted to scream.

447
00:24:57,654 --> 00:25:00,160
What, what did you do?

448
00:25:01,024 --> 00:25:02,999
I screamed.

449
00:25:04,698 --> 00:25:08,534
At least I heard screaming.
Pretty sure it was me.

450
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:11,970
Adrian, you were giving a speech
in front of a group of people.

451
00:25:12,005 --> 00:25:14,013
That's real progress.

452
00:25:14,048 --> 00:25:16,369
No, really. I'm very proud of you.

453
00:25:16,404 --> 00:25:17,896
Yeah.

454
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,452
You're never going to be
completely free of fear.

455
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:22,857
You can't expect that.

456
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:26,387
But real courage is being afraid
of something and doing it anyway.

457
00:25:26,422 --> 00:25:28,522
Nah. - What?

458
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:34,085
Steve Wagner said
the exact same thing.

459
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,858
Really?

460
00:25:35,893 --> 00:25:38,836
The astronaut.

461
00:25:40,245 --> 00:25:42,645
Doctor, killed his girlfriend.

462
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,759
Which I do not condone.
It's indefensible, of course.

463
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:51,515
Seems I'm afraid all the time.

464
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,296
I'm so tired of being afraid.

465
00:25:55,331 --> 00:25:58,469
Adrian. I'm anxious to
talk about your phobias.

466
00:25:58,504 --> 00:26:01,106
We talked about aversion therapy.

467
00:26:01,141 --> 00:26:02,798
Now, okay.

468
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:05,346
Let's, let's, let's do it.
Let's do it right now.

469
00:26:05,381 --> 00:26:06,502
- Okay. Okay. All right.
- Here we go.

470
00:26:06,537 --> 00:26:10,735
All right. Which of your fears
would you like to work on first?

471
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:14,588
- Glaciers.
- Glaciers.

472
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:16,283
No.

473
00:26:16,696 --> 00:26:18,052
Rodeos.

474
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:20,082
Ah, glaciers. Glaciers.

475
00:26:20,117 --> 00:26:23,725
All right, why don't we just
start with a basic one?

476
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,379
- Fear of heights.
- Okay. Heights.

477
00:26:26,414 --> 00:26:27,507
- Heights.
- Let's do it.

478
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:29,478
Okay, good.
Let's get up on the roof right now.

479
00:26:29,513 --> 00:26:32,556
Wait. Whoa. Okay. Wait, wait.
All right, wait, sit.

480
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,199
- I'll sit.
- Sit down.

481
00:26:34,234 --> 00:26:37,419
Okay, I'm down. Sitting down.

482
00:26:38,117 --> 00:26:40,634
Not, I'm not ready.

483
00:26:40,964 --> 00:26:42,779
For that.

484
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:50,494
Let's, let's just build up to it gradually.

485
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:51,836
Here's what.

486
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:56,044
Why don't we sit here and, uh,

487
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,258
name really tall things.

488
00:26:59,293 --> 00:27:01,832
I'll go first.

489
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,194
The Sears tower.

490
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:10,093
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

491
00:27:10,613 --> 00:27:12,919
No. That's too tall.

492
00:27:12,954 --> 00:27:15,505
Um, not the Sears tower.

493
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,646
Just a regular Sears maybe.

494
00:27:18,681 --> 00:27:23,281
Just a regular Sears.
Department store.

495
00:27:23,316 --> 00:27:28,932
Adrian, why don't we work
on your phobias another time, okay?

496
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,911
Okay.

497
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,087
When I...

498
00:27:38,122 --> 00:27:45,175
when I look at a man,
a real man like Steve Wagner...

499
00:27:46,493 --> 00:27:48,816
I just feel weak.

500
00:27:48,851 --> 00:27:51,607
I just feel so inadequate.

501
00:27:52,848 --> 00:27:55,335
I know he's guilty.

502
00:27:55,564 --> 00:27:58,410
But I'll never be able to prove it.

503
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:03,957
Adrian, Steve Wagner is a human being.

504
00:28:03,992 --> 00:28:09,768
And if he's guilty, I know something
he's very much afraid of.

505
00:28:09,803 --> 00:28:11,818
What's that?

506
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:14,295
You.

507
00:28:30,506 --> 00:28:33,695
She's in the house.

508
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:39,162
He was up there in space.

509
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,978
Circling the Earth.

510
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:43,780
- Maybe he had an accomplice.
- No.

511
00:28:43,815 --> 00:28:45,967
We have statements from
all of the neighbors.

512
00:28:46,002 --> 00:28:48,677
There were no visitors, no cars.

513
00:28:48,712 --> 00:28:51,544
She was definitely alone.

514
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:56,539
Somehow he killed her from up there.

515
00:28:56,574 --> 00:28:59,633
Well, she collected a lot of dolls.

516
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:02,711
Lot of really ugly dolls.

517
00:29:02,746 --> 00:29:05,946
Natalie. Holes.

518
00:29:05,981 --> 00:29:08,567
How did we miss that?

519
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,850
They were drilled recently.

520
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:15,284
So? She wasn't killed out there.
She was killed in here.

521
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:19,136
She was found in there.

522
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:23,267
She could've been killed
someplace else.

523
00:29:33,696 --> 00:29:35,342
Speak of the devil.

524
00:29:35,377 --> 00:29:37,224
Sorry. I didn't know anyone was here.

525
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:39,630
Are you looking for something?

526
00:29:39,665 --> 00:29:42,840
I wanted a flower from her garden.

527
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:45,471
She loved this garden.

528
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,423
I cared for the girl.
I won't deny that.

529
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:51,388
You came a long way to pick a flower.

530
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,287
Actually, I was heading up here anyway.

531
00:29:53,322 --> 00:29:55,483
I have a test flight
at Paxton in a couple of hours.

532
00:29:55,518 --> 00:29:57,024
Now it's your turn.
What are you doing here?

533
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:59,895
I'm investigating Joanne's murder.

534
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,609
- Her suicide.
- It was murder.

535
00:30:02,644 --> 00:30:05,065
I think we both know that.

536
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,471
Come on, man. Are you deaf?

537
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,608
Please, just close the damn garage door.

538
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:11,727
Well, I did three times!

539
00:30:11,762 --> 00:30:14,081
Well, guess what?
It's open again.

540
00:30:14,116 --> 00:30:18,141
- Maybe it's broke.
- It ain't broke. It's brand-new.

541
00:30:18,634 --> 00:30:20,274
Holy son of a, look at this.

542
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:22,347
Look at him.
He looks just like...

543
00:30:22,382 --> 00:30:24,116
Hey, you know what,
I think that is. - Who?

544
00:30:24,151 --> 00:30:26,478
The, who?
The, he's the, the guy.

545
00:30:26,513 --> 00:30:28,484
The spaceman from TV.
He's famous.

546
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:31,434
Go get the camera would you?
Get the, get the, stay with your brother.

547
00:30:31,469 --> 00:30:32,954
Go get the camera.

548
00:30:32,989 --> 00:30:35,459
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.

549
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:40,861
Uh, uh, uh, excuse me.
Uh, you, you're famous, right?

550
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:44,518
- You're that Steve Wolanski...
- Wagner. Steven Wagner.

551
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:47,209
Wagner. I knew that.
Wagner.

552
00:30:47,244 --> 00:30:49,005
You're the space cowboy, right?

553
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,841
Oh, man, you're, you're the dude that

554
00:30:50,842 --> 00:30:53,129
landed the space shuttle
when it was on fire.

555
00:30:53,164 --> 00:30:54,271
That's correct.

556
00:30:54,306 --> 00:30:56,635
- I lost ten bucks on that.
- Sorry to disappoint you.

557
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,601
Would you excuse us?
We're in the middle of something.

558
00:30:58,636 --> 00:31:01,342
Could you excuse us, please?

559
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:07,519
You folks live across the street.
Is that, right?

560
00:31:07,554 --> 00:31:10,264
Huh? Yeah. It's us right over here.

561
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:12,016
Yeah, that's right,
how are you, man?

562
00:31:12,051 --> 00:31:13,282
Good to meet you. I'm Darrel.

563
00:31:13,317 --> 00:31:17,111
This is my daughter Donna here
and this is, uh... - Hi, nice to meet you.

564
00:31:17,146 --> 00:31:20,565
Benny. - What the hell
are you doing here?

565
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,435
You're curious, aren't you?

566
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:26,081
That's the best thing a boy can have.
Curiosity.

567
00:31:26,534 --> 00:31:28,926
I was friends
with the lady that lived here.

568
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:31,958
Oh, man. That's a shame.
That's...

569
00:31:31,993 --> 00:31:34,056
that's heart breaking.

570
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:37,169
- Can we get a picture?
- I can do better than that.

571
00:31:37,204 --> 00:31:40,081
I'm flight testing a brand-new jet
in a couple of hours.

572
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:42,316
How'd you like to come and watch?

573
00:31:42,351 --> 00:31:44,256
Bring the whole family.
Be my guests.

574
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:46,823
What, are you, you kidding me?
They wouldn't mind?

575
00:31:46,858 --> 00:31:49,441
You have every right to be there.
You're a tax payer, right?

576
00:31:49,476 --> 00:31:51,181
Yeah.

577
00:31:51,216 --> 00:31:54,147
- Sales tax.
- Could we come too?

578
00:31:54,182 --> 00:31:57,879
I'm a big aviation buff, fan.

579
00:31:57,914 --> 00:32:00,675
That's so true.
Such a fanatic.

580
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,059
- I love airplanes.
- Just crazy about the, uh...

581
00:32:03,094 --> 00:32:05,698
- Can't get enough of them.
- The takeoff.

582
00:32:05,733 --> 00:32:07,495
And the wings and all.

583
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,572
- There we go. The rudder.
- And that, the landing.

584
00:32:10,607 --> 00:32:13,523
You wouldn't mind if we come to you.

585
00:32:18,699 --> 00:32:21,232
Talking about state-of-the-art
technology here.

586
00:32:21,267 --> 00:32:23,699
The most advanced
war planes ever built.

587
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:25,842
Some of these planes are prototypes.

588
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,766
That means nobody's ever flown them.

589
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:30,099
- Sounds dangerous.
- It can be dangerous.

590
00:32:30,134 --> 00:32:31,809
Then why do you do it?

591
00:32:31,844 --> 00:32:34,011
If I didn't do it, Benny,
somebody else would.

592
00:32:34,046 --> 00:32:36,206
Where's the fun in that?

593
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:39,647
Now you kids will love this.
This is a flight simulator.

594
00:32:39,682 --> 00:32:42,525
- It's kind of like a $30 million
video game. - Cool.

595
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,891
- Want to check it out?
- Okay.

596
00:32:43,926 --> 00:32:47,088
You grown-ups stay here.
We'll be right back.

597
00:32:47,296 --> 00:32:49,865
Captain Savo, you're in charge.

598
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,507
He is good people.

599
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:56,586
Yeah. He is good people.

600
00:32:56,621 --> 00:32:58,567
Hey, how well do you know him?

601
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,655
Well enough to wonder
what he's doing.

602
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,195
Let's go in.

603
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,371
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's a little dark in there.

604
00:33:07,406 --> 00:33:10,318
Let's just wait out here for awhile.

605
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,141
Paulie!

606
00:33:13,349 --> 00:33:15,036
Why is this garage door open?

607
00:33:15,071 --> 00:33:16,374
Don't know, serge.
Opened by itself.

608
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:18,713
Maybe we installed it wrong.

609
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:22,867
I got the same problem with my garage.
It's like an epidemic.

610
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:27,238
Natalie, I know how he did it.

611
00:33:27,273 --> 00:33:29,173
I know how he killed her!

612
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,252
It's all about the garage doors.

613
00:33:31,287 --> 00:33:33,321
It is? - Yes!

614
00:33:33,356 --> 00:33:36,162
- Dad. - Daddy!
- Where's Mr. Wagner?

615
00:33:36,197 --> 00:33:37,940
He left. He said
he was late for something.

616
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:41,184
- What's wrong, sweetie?
- The astronaut took her doll.

617
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:44,125
- He took her doll?
- That's it!

618
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,698
Natalie, it's all about the doll!

619
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,538
You just said it was all
about the garage door.

620
00:33:48,573 --> 00:33:51,590
It's about the doll and the garage door.

621
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:53,779
It's about both.

622
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:01,956
Mr. Cain, where did you get that doll?

623
00:34:01,991 --> 00:34:04,762
I... - Come on.
You stole it, didn't you?

624
00:34:04,797 --> 00:34:06,946
It was in a box sitting
on Joanne's front porch.

625
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:09,977
And you took it just like you took
the fruit of month box.

626
00:34:10,012 --> 00:34:12,049
It was sitting there
for three days, all right?

627
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:15,306
- I figured she wasn't home.
- You're a horrible neighbor.

628
00:34:17,872 --> 00:34:20,428
Honey, it's gonna be all right.

629
00:34:20,463 --> 00:34:22,287
It's gonna be okay.

630
00:34:22,467 --> 00:34:25,255
It's gonna be all right.
Sweetie, come on.

631
00:34:30,062 --> 00:34:32,267
This is captain Savo.
I just lost two of my civilians.

632
00:34:32,302 --> 00:34:34,675
Notify the law enforcement desk.

633
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,097
Thank you.
The captain's on his way.

634
00:34:38,132 --> 00:34:40,983
We have to find Wagner
before he gets rid of that doll.

635
00:34:41,018 --> 00:34:43,179
Monk, I don't understand.

636
00:34:43,432 --> 00:34:45,154
Here's what happened.

637
00:34:45,189 --> 00:34:46,440
Before he left,

638
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:48,572
Wagner must've gone
to Joanne's house.

639
00:34:48,607 --> 00:34:50,568
He drugged her
but not enough to kill her.

640
00:34:50,603 --> 00:34:53,678
Just enough to knock her out
for a couple of days.

641
00:34:53,713 --> 00:34:57,109
Then he built a machine,
a murder machine,

642
00:34:57,144 --> 00:35:01,481
a machine that would hang her
on Wednesday long after he was gone.

643
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:05,122
- What kind of machine?
- A garage door opener.

644
00:35:05,157 --> 00:35:07,963
He left her there drugged.
Probably tied up.

645
00:35:07,998 --> 00:35:11,956
And then took off into space with
the whole world watching.

646
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:17,231
Mr. Monk, what are you doing?

647
00:35:18,503 --> 00:35:20,436
I don't know.

648
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:22,953
They're at ramp two.
He's handling the missiles.

649
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:25,099
No, no, no, no.
Those are missiles.

650
00:35:25,134 --> 00:35:27,288
They could be nuclear weapons!

651
00:35:27,323 --> 00:35:30,687
Then stop me for the love of god.

652
00:35:36,129 --> 00:35:38,301
I don't understand.
She died on Wednesday.

653
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:41,793
- How did he activate the machine?
- It was so simple, it was brilliant!

654
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:44,587
He used a remote control.

655
00:35:44,622 --> 00:35:47,815
He taped it or glued it down
so it stayed on.

656
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:51,842
Then he put the remote control
inside one of those dolls.

657
00:35:51,877 --> 00:35:54,663
Then he mailed it to her own house
second day mail.

658
00:35:54,698 --> 00:35:56,984
Second day mail?
Wednesday morning.

659
00:35:57,019 --> 00:35:59,374
Exactly. It was like a time bomb.

660
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:03,587
The mail man delivered the remote control,
put it on the front porch.

661
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:07,588
On the other side of that door,
she was being strangled.

662
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,119
Oh, my god.

663
00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:11,560
But they found her in the living room!

664
00:36:11,595 --> 00:36:14,484
After he landed,
Wagner went back to her house.

665
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:16,577
He dismantled the machine
and moved her body into the other room.

666
00:36:16,612 --> 00:36:19,612
It was a perfect plan
except for one thing.

667
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:21,520
The doll was missing.

668
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:25,756
He must've panicked.
He went back there again today to find it.

669
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:29,131
He knew that remote could
tie him to the murder.

670
00:36:29,403 --> 00:36:31,847
His fingerprints are all over it.
Excuse me!

671
00:36:31,882 --> 00:36:33,435
Hi. - Hey, nice ride.

672
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:37,036
- Hi, We're looking for Steve Wagner.
- He may be on the flight line.

673
00:36:37,071 --> 00:36:38,850
I think they just cleared him for takeoff.

674
00:36:38,885 --> 00:36:40,751
Great. We'd love to watch.
Which way?

675
00:36:40,786 --> 00:36:44,445
You can't miss him.
He's in the brand-new FA-22.

676
00:36:44,946 --> 00:36:47,183
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

677
00:36:47,218 --> 00:36:49,610
Yeah, hi.
Hello, again.

678
00:36:49,645 --> 00:36:53,298
Could you settle a bet?
My friend and I were wondering if, uh,

679
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:58,068
somebody could drop anything
out of the cockpit of an FA-22.

680
00:36:58,103 --> 00:37:01,484
- Of course, I say no way.
- Of course you can.

681
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,822
Like what?

682
00:37:02,857 --> 00:37:06,860
- Uh, you know, a Japanese doll.
- About this big.

683
00:37:06,895 --> 00:37:10,872
Well, there's an air lock. Like a chute
to drop flares and emergency transmitters.

684
00:37:10,907 --> 00:37:12,509
I owe you one. Go figure.

685
00:37:12,544 --> 00:37:14,379
Thank you. - That's unbelievable.
You win that one.

686
00:37:14,414 --> 00:37:16,935
Wait a second.
Hey, where's your escort?

687
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,561
- Go, go, go!
- Hey, where you going?

688
00:37:39,806 --> 00:37:42,011
No, no, no, Mr. Monk! Wait!

689
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,285
Wait up! Wait up!

690
00:38:07,937 --> 00:38:08,864
Hey!

691
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:10,269
Hey!

692
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,852
Pull it over!

693
00:38:12,926 --> 00:38:14,784
Pull it over!

694
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:46,428
Put your hands on your head.
Get on your knees.

695
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,756
Sir, step away from the jet.

696
00:38:53,986 --> 00:38:56,869
Step away from the jet.

697
00:38:59,864 --> 00:39:01,622
San Francisco police department.

698
00:39:01,657 --> 00:39:03,585
- Stop! They're friendly!
- That's my man out there.

699
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,224
Pack your weapons.
Stand down.

700
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:08,807
I say again. Pack your weapons.
Stand down.

701
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:46,340
Captain, please hand me the item.

702
00:39:49,602 --> 00:39:52,581
The doll, sir.
Hand me the doll.

703
00:39:54,654 --> 00:39:57,993
Security team, secure the suspect.

704
00:40:16,736 --> 00:40:20,289
Helped the suspect.
Now secure the air craft.

705
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:29,982
Control, suspect secure.

706
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:47,863
Come on. Julie. Come on.

707
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:52,805
Mr. Monk.
Julie made something for you.

708
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:57,327
What? - Well, all my friends at school
were talking about what you did

709
00:40:57,362 --> 00:41:00,615
and how we were
so wrong about Mr. Wagner.

710
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,413
And how you caught him.

711
00:41:02,448 --> 00:41:06,403
Well, um, anyways,
I made you this in art class.

712
00:41:07,135 --> 00:41:09,180
Oh, Julie.

713
00:41:09,215 --> 00:41:11,144
It's a medal of valor.

714
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:15,412
'Cause you're the bravest man
I've ever known except for my father.

715
00:41:15,447 --> 00:41:18,786
Oh, sweetie.
I'm gonna get the camera.

716
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:20,382
Well, I...

717
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:23,033
Julie, thank you.
I, um, thank you.

718
00:41:23,068 --> 00:41:24,863
Wait, wait a minute.
What is that? A pin?

719
00:41:24,898 --> 00:41:27,878
- Yeah, it's okay. I'll be careful.
- Wait, wait. That, that, you know that.

720
00:41:27,913 --> 00:41:30,859
That can puncture the skin.
People get infected.

721
00:41:30,894 --> 00:41:32,543
I'll just hold it.
How about that?

722
00:41:32,578 --> 00:41:35,578
- That's just as good.
- Okay. Smile.

723
00:41:35,613 --> 00:41:39,000
- You too, Rambo.
- Wait, look. It says courage.

724
00:41:39,035 --> 00:41:42,670
Yeah. I see that. I see that.
Take, take the picture.

725
00:41:42,705 --> 00:41:45,865
No flash. No flash.
Retinal scarring.
