(reporter)
The countdown is underway
here at Edwards Air Force Base.

2
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:05,406
The new experimental
rocket plane

3
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:07,808
which was developed
by Altman Aerodynamics

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,810
is scheduled to launch
tomorrow morning

5
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,113
at 7:30 Pacific time.

6
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:15,149
The four man crew will be lead
by a familiar face.

7
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:18,452
Astronaut and civilian
test pilot Steven Wagner.

8
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:21,189
Wagner became a national hero
four years ago

9
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:22,823
when he made a courageous
emergency landing

10
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,125
in the space shuttle

11
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:25,093
during reentry.

12
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:28,462
A national hero
in my very own living room.

13
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:30,464
But I'll never
be a hero to you, will I?

14
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:31,499
You were once.

15
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:32,633
Is this it?

16
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,770
Between the Sheets:

17
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:38,606
The Joanne Raphelson Story.

18
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,409
You want to read it?
You're chapter five.

19
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:43,411
How many chapters
are there?
15.

20
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,846
You've been a busy girl,
Joanne.

21
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,818
You really went
into detail?

22
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:52,286
My editor insisted on it.

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,454
The juicier, the better.

24
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,289
That's why I called you,
Steve.

25
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:57,458
I didn't want you
to be surprised.

26
00:00:57,491 --> 00:01:00,128
I appreciate that, Joanne.

27
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:05,199
I really do.

28
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,703
So has anyone seen
this new version yet?

29
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:10,871
Not yet.

30
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,706
When do you hand it in?

31
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,609
Next week.
I'm still proofreading it.

32
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:20,348
Oh.

33
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:22,216
An olive, a cherry,
and an onion.

34
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,384
What do you call this?

35
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,852
A Spacewalk.
It's my own recipe.

36
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,620
It's a good name.

37
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:29,890
Feel like I'm flying.

38
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,559
So do you want to read it?

39
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,162
I plan to.
That's why I'm here.

40
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:36,364
But I've changed my mind.

41
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:38,432
Hell, I've been a test pilot
for 15 years.

42
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:41,602
I once landed a space shuttle
in the ocean.

43
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:44,505
I think I can handle
whatever's in chapter five.

44
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:47,141
So hand it in.
Hit me with your best shot.

45
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:49,477
Thank you, Steve.

46
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:54,348
Mm.

47
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:55,783
(reporter)
Sir, there's a rumor

48
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:57,451
you might be considering
a run for Senate.

49
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,354
Look at you.

50
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,192
Damn, you're cute.

Miss Raphelson.

Miss Raphelson, I see your car.

00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,381
Miss Raphelson?

73
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,817
Madre de dios!

Career day.

77
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:46,994
What would I talk about?

78
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,662
Your career.

79
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,398
Your job.

80
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:51,565
Oh, come on, Mr. Monk.

81
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,966
It would mean
so much to Julie.

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,468
Yeah. I can't do it.
I'm sorry.

83
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,304
I can't speak in public.

84
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:57,638
See, that's not true.

85
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,307
Remember when I first
started working for you

86
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,509
and you made that list
of all your fears and phobias.

87
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:02,676
There were 103 things.

88
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,413
Public speaking wasn't
one of them.

89
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:06,880
Actually, there were
a couple of things

90
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,048
that I didn't mention.

91
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,850
I didn't want you
to think I was weird.

92
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,619
Why don't you ask
the Captain?

93
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,587
Whatever it is,
thank you for asking,

94
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:14,822
but I can't do it.

She comes in

98
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:24,031
She found the body
right here a couple hours ago.

99
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,700
Her name is, uh,
Joanne Raphelson.

100
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,869
36. Former Vegas showgirl.

101
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:30,604
And the coroner
just took the body.

102
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:32,540
Said she's been dead
for five days.

103

in New York.

114
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,029
She was about to have
a book published.

115
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:59,667

116
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,435
Between the Sheets:
The Joanne Raphelson Story.

Oh. Yeah.

118
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:07,408
I get it.

119
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:10,544
And a check for 50 grand,
which she has not deposited.

120

to hang yourself, huh?

Well, don't be.

126
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,994
And that's an order.

127
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,829
You're ordering me
not to be awestruck?
That's right.

128
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,631
Stand over there
and don't be awestruck.

Uh, yeah. Looks like
her computer's missing.

go outside

00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:54,555

139
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,424
Yes, sir.

So am I right?

142
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:04,364
Something's not kosher.

143
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,472
It's her driver's license.

144
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:14,575
How tall do you think
that stool is?

145
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,678
Mm...

146
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:23,484
The rope's 7'6".

147
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:26,554
But according to her license,

148
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,856
she's only 5'5".

149
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,990
I'm 5'5".

150
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:33,961
Step up.

151
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,467
You're right.

152
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,704
It doesn't add up.

153
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,173
So how long
have you lived here?

154
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,576
15 years. Maybe 14.

You know what,
my old lady would know that.

You can ask her
when she gets back...

00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,582
if she's sober.

158

Hey, you want
one of these?

Nectarines.
They're the perfect fruit.

160
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,119
Okay.
There you go.

161
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,623
Now why is the garage door
open again?

162
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,759
Benny, what'd I tell you
about this?

163
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:07,127
I didn't open it.

164
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,496
Really.
Well, then who did?

165
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,498
Maybe Donna did it.
You ever think of that?

166
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,132
Your sister couldn't
open up a box of crayons.

167
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,801
She's six years old.

168
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:16,704
Mr. Cain, I just have
a few more questions.

169
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,939
How well did you know
Ms. Raphelson?

170
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,741
Not as well
as I wanted to

171
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,776
if you get my drift.

172
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,244
Hey, she was hot.

173
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,046
What a waste.

174
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,048
Did she have any visitors
last week?

175
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,183
Say Tuesday or Wednesday?

176
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:31,919
No.

177
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,253
Nobody. Nobody.

178
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,822
Not as far as I recall
anyway.

179
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,524
Oh, for C--
Not a--

180
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:37,825
Hector's out!

181
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,760
Benny, could you--
go get your dog, please.

182
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,828
Why should I?

183
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,830
Because you opened up
the garage.

184
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,700
This is a police offer,
right?

185
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:49,269
I could have him
lock you up.

186
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,871
You think about that.

187
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,540
How's it going?

188
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:55,142
Captain.
This is, uh, Darrel Cain.

189
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,177
Darrel Cain,
Captain Leland Stottlemeyer.

190
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,685
'Scuse me.

191
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,254
That box is addressed
to Joanne Raphelson.

192
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,158
Yeah. It was on her porch.

193
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:15,262
Well, I'd heard she died.
I figured it was up for grabs.

194
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,698
You can't just take mail
from somebody's porch.

195
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,232
Yeah, you can if it's fruit.

196
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:23,103
Law doesn't apply to fruit
because it's perishable.

197
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,237
Actually, sir,

198
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:26,574
the law does apply to fruit.

199
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,809
Are you eating one?

200
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,978
No. I was just
putting that back.

201
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,179
(man)
Captain.

202
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:33,681
You wanted to see
her phone record.

203
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:36,183
Yeah.

204
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,151
No calls at all
on Tuesday.

205
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,553
Or Monday?

206
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:42,222
Last call she made
was Saturday morning

207
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:47,995
at 2:05 a.m.

208
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,230
[whistles]

209
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,033
Hello. This is Captain
Leland Stottlemeyer,

210
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,167
San Francisco Police.

211
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,203
Who's this?

212
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,981
(Wagner)
Captain Stottlemeyer?

213
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:11,051
Yeah. Hey.

214
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,185
Is this a bad time?

215
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,353
Oh. No. No.

216
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,222
Some friends are throwing me
a little party.

217
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,023
It's sort of a tradition.

218
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,225
Congratulations
on your flight.

219
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,359
Hey, and, uh,

220
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,594
congratulations
on that crash landing

221
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:21,729
four years ago.

222
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:24,197
Oh, and, uh,
marrying the figure skater.

223
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,366
Yeah, congratulations
on your whole damn life.

224
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,636
This is Lt. Disher,

225
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,971
Natalie Teeger,
and Adrian Monk.

226
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,140
Monk. I know that name.

227
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,275
You're the detective.

228
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,144
The one who quit.

229
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,346
I-I-I didn't quit,
exactly.

230
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,949
It was a--it was a leave
of absence.

231
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,617
It's nothing to be
ashamed of, Mr. Monk.

232
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:45,786
Some people just can't
handle the pressure.

233
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,187
I-I-I didn't quit.

234
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,222
Mr. Wagner, I'm sorry.

235
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,859
My daughter just wrote
a school paper about you.

236
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:54,161
Good. I need all the PR
I can get.

237
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,163
She's not going to believe
that I met you.

238
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,998
Do you mind if I take
a picture?
Not at all.

239
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,634
I didn't quit.

240
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:02,202
There were extenuating
circumstances.

241
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,104
There always are.

242
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,105
The trick is

243
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,874
not to let them stop us.

244
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,744
Captain, you said
it was important.

245
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,245
Oh, yeah.
Um...

246
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,281
do you know a woman
named Joanne Raphelson?

247
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,119
She's dead, isn't she?

248
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,188
She finally did it.

249
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,191
You're not surprised.

250
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,325
[sighs]

251
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,193
Joanne's been depressed
for months.

252
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,195
For years, really.

253
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,997
She was about to have
a book published

254
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,198
but somehow
that made it worse.

255
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,300
Like I was saying,
Mr. Monk,

256
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,802
some people just can't
handle the pressure.

257
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,269
It was a psychological
discharge, for God's sake.

258
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,370
It was only temporary.

259
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:38,706
I plan on being
reinstated.

260
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:39,840
He's so much better.

261
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,275
How well did you know her?

262
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,844
Intimately.

263
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,846
When was the last time
you saw her?

264
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,380
Five years ago.

265
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:50,350
No, wait, she called you
on the phone last week.

266
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,019
That's true.

267
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,354
She calls me once or twice
a year when she's lonely,

268
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,824
depressed, or drunk,
and sometimes all three.

269
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,391
Steven?

270
00:10:58,425 --> 00:10:59,927
Honey, we're cutting
the cake.

271
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,094
Hey, look, uh,

272
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,096
we could talk about this
tomorrow, okay?

273
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,365
That's all right, Captain.
I have no secrets from my wife.

274
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,867
Honey, these gentlemen
are detectives.

275
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,870
Joanne Raphelson is dead.

276
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,372
Oh, no. Poor girl.

277
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,174
I made a mistake, Captain.

278
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,276
Five years ago.

279
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:17,745
Nicole knows
all about it.

280
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:20,180
I don't deserve
this woman.

281
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,481
Excuse me, ma'am.

282
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,483
What is that
you're drinking?

283
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,185
It's called a Spacewalk.

284
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,387
My husband invented it.

285
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,257
Is--is that an olive?

286
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,324
And an onion

287
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,492
and a cherry.

288
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,394
It's my claim to fame.
Would you like one?

289
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,763
No, thank you.

290
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:36,930
Mr. Wagner,

291
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:38,065
I was reading
about your flight

292
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,233
and they said they almost
had to cancel the liftoff.

293
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:42,269
You were running late.
That's true.

294
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,971
I got lost on my way
to Edwards.

295
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,072
Can you believe it?

296
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,373
You--you got lost?

297
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:47,941
I tried a different
short cut.

298
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:50,277
I-I-I guess I'm a better
navigator in the sky

299
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,312
than I am on the highways.

300
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,114
Congressman,
glad you could make it.

301
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,349
Steve. Hey, when are we
going to have that talk

302
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,517
about your future?

303
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,087
The sooner, the better.

304
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,088
Will you excuse us?

305
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,222
My friends are waiting.

306
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,124
We can talk about this
some other time.

307
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,292
Absolutely.
Great.

308
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:08,295
It was nice to meet you.

309
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:11,331
He's the guy.

310
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,466
Who's the guy?

311
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,469
The astronaut.
He killed her.

312
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:19,006
Somebody made
that exact same drink

313
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,308
at Joanne Raphelson's house
before she died.

314
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,176
Monk, it's not possible.

315
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,244
He was in space.

316
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,046
He did it.

317
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,481
Outer space, Monk.

318
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:31,284
He was on TV.
He was orbiting the Earth.

319
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:34,021
Gotta admit,
it's a pretty good alibi.

320
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:39,860
He--he's the guy.

321
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,075
Monk, 99 times
out of 100,

322
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,077
I am in your corner.

323
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,278
But I just can't see it.

324
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,147
Steve Wagner
is a national hero.

325
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,815
It's true, Mr. Monk.

326
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:03,350
He was on the cover
of Time magazine.

327
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,952
Actually,
it was Newsweek.

328
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,386
Actually, it was both.

329
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,388
Now look, we need
to tread carefully here.

330
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,090
First off,
there's no motive.

331
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,291
The wife knew
about the affair.

332
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,826
A lot of people did.

333
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,294
It wasn't just the affair.

334
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,229
We just talked
to Joanne Raphelson's editor

335
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:17,397
in New York.

336
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,232
She was about to hand in
her next draft,

337
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:22,235
which contained a couple
of real bombshells.

338
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,203
Like?

339
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,471
Like which
of her ex-boyfriends

340
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,139
beat her up
five years ago.

341
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:28,008
Somebody put her
in the hospital.

342
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,910
She had a concussion,
right?

343
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,212
Mm-hmm.

344
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,147
And you think
Steve Wagner's involved?

345
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,383
I just don't believe it.

346
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,351
I'm sorry, Mr. Monk.

347
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,923
Look, Wagner wants
to run for office.

348
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,492
A story like that
would bury him.

349
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,061
Okay. Maybe you found
a motive.

350
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:50,297
Maybe. But it doesn't matter.

351
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,564
And I'll tell you why.

352
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:54,868
Because your suspect, Monk,
was in outer space.

353
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:56,036
He wasn't on this planet.

354
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,337
It's true.

355
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,139
Julie and I watched it
on television.

356
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,107
The whole world
was watching.

357
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,043
He took off on Monday
and he landed on Friday.

358
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,344
Here's the case file.

359
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:08,015
The coroner is 100% sure.

360
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,082
He is certain

361
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:11,318
that Joanne Raphelson died
of ligature strangulation

362
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,854
on Wednesday morning
while your man was in space.

363
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,891
Now maybe we should
take a minute

364
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:20,227
and see if we can think
of a better alibi.

365
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,585
It's a pretty good alibi.

366
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,187
(Stottlemeyer)
Yeah.

367
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,022
She had drugs
in her system?

368
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,223
Barbiturates.

369
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,025
Yeah, coroner says
she took some pills.

370
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,193
They didn't work.

371
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,062
She went to plan B
and dangled herself.

372
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,163
It happens all the time.

373
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:56,964
But you said yourself

374
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:59,032
the crime scene
didn't look kosher.

375
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,568
Monk, what I'm saying
is it might be murder,

376
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:04,171
but it wasn't him.

377
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,238
Captain.

378
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:06,306
I think Monk's right.

379
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,141
Thank you.
Reinforcements.

380
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:10,377
I think I know
how Wagner did it.

381
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,145
Okay. This is the ship.

382
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:14,681
And let's pretend this globe
represents the earth.

383
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:17,717
That's a globe.
It does represent the earth.

384
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,221
Right. Okay.

385
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,956
Here's what happened.

386
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,257
First part was easy.

387
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,258
He takes off.

388
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,602
As he passes over
San Francisco,

389
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,405
he activates the escape pod.

390
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,672
Well, wait.

391
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:42,009
Uh, wait. Uh, was--
was there an escape pod

392
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,143
on the ship?

393
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,979
No. Not officially.
But I think he smuggled one on.

394
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,015
Mm-hmm. And where did he
get it, the escape pod?

395
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:50,317
He built it.

396
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,584
Yeah. Out of a kit.

397
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:52,619
In his basement.

398
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,521
He's resourceful.

399
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,990
Anyway,

400
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:58,258
splashdown.

401
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,127
He climbs out of the pod,

402
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,328
makes his way
to her house,

403
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,063
kills her,
climbs back onto the pod,

404
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:06,633
fires up the engines,
back in space.

405
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,236
Thank you, Randy.

406
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:10,603
It's just a theory.

407
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,072
I don't think so.

408
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:15,442
No. I've heard theories before
and, uh,

409
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,310
they don't sound like that.

410
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,412
[cell phone rings]

411
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,117
It's him.
It's Steve Wagner.

412
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,452
[cell phone rings]

413
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,020
Hello?

414
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:30,523
Yes.

415
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,059
Really?

416
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:35,028
Oh, that's wonderful.

417
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:37,697
Uh, tomorrow morning
at 10:00 a.m.

418
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,234
Oh, the kids
are going to be so thrilled.

419
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:43,503
Okay, great.
I'll see you then.

420
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,338
Steve Wagner
is speaking at Julie's school

421
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,207
for Career Day.

422
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,042
Wait, you invited him.

423
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:50,577
Yeah. I met his PR
person last night

424
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,279
as we were leaving.

425
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:54,614
Natalie, he killed
his ex-girlfriend.

426
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:58,218
Monk, maybe you
should go too.

427
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,086
You think the guy's
involved,

428
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,421
it'll give you a chance
to feel him out.

429
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,225
Fine.

430
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:06,426
Okay. I'll do it.

431
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:11,131
You're both coming?

432
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,300
Class mom of the year.

433
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,769
When I was your age,
I was a Boy Scout.

434
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:19,372
Who here knows
the Boy Scout motto?

435
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:20,773
(all)
Be prepared.

436
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:21,841
That's right.

437
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,510
And that motto
saved my life.

438
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,512
Because when the landing gear
didn't come down,

439
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,080
I was prepared.

440
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:29,216
I knew what I had to do.

441
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,184
I went around Florida.

442
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,419
Good-bye, Florida.

443
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,221
Over Louisiana.

444
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:37,290
And landed the space shuttle
here in the Gulf of Mexico

445
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:39,192
with a great big
belly flop.

446
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,161
And you weren't even scared?

447
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,529
No, I wasn't scared.

448
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,431
I was terrified!

449
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:45,765
[laughter]

450
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,301
People called me a hero.

451
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:50,603
But anybody--anybody
could've done that.

452
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,772
You or you

453
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,307
or you

454
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:55,708
or you or...

455
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,212
you or you.

456
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:03,250
Being brave
is being afraid of something

457
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:04,851
but doing it anyway.

458
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,256
What are you going
to do next?

459
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,757
Well, tomorrow,
I'm testing a brand-new jet

460
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,858
for the Air Force

461
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:12,859
called the FA22 Raptor.

462
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:15,228
It's the most advanced
fighter in the world.

463
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:18,265
She's faster
than the speed of sound.

464
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:20,333
So if you hear a big boom
in the sky tomorrow,

465
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:21,734
that's me saying
hello, kids.

466
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,404
Before I go,

467
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,474
I brought some official
Steve Wagner laser pointers

468
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:28,641
for all you kids.

469
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:31,144
Here you go.
Take one, pass them back.

470
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,912
Well, I had a great time.

471
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,483
And remember, what does
Steve Wagner want you to do?

472
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:40,119
(all)
Aim high.

473
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:45,358
Wasn't he great?
Let's give him a hand.

474
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:47,627
Thank you.

475
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,929
Okay, so Julie's
next guest is Mr. Adrian Monk,

476
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,464
who's also my boss.

477
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:53,300
So everybody
be extra nice.

478
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,168
He's going to talk
about what it's like

479
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:57,337
to be a police
detective.

480
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,843
Hi.

481
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,183
Hi, I'm...

482
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:12,685
I'm, um...

483
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,456
I'm...

484
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:29,936
[clears throat]
Leave it.

485
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,505
[dropping to floor]

486
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,274
[laughter]

487
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:40,847
I'm, uh...

488
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,384
I'm Adrian Monk.

489
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:47,454
Who wants to be a detective
when they grow up?

490
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,827
What about you?

491
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,330
No?

492
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:00,567
Everybody in your row
has their hand up.

493
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,972
If you put
your hand up then...

494
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,241
it would be a perfect row.

495
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,847
Put your hand up!

496
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,583
Thank you.

497
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,621
Where's your gun?

498
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,956
Um, I, uh,

499
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,493
I don't have--
I don't have one.

500
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:27,827
(male student)
You can't carry one

501
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,462
cause you had a breakdown.

502
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:31,331
[laughter]

503
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,566
Oh, well, uh...

504
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,268
Julie says you're afraid
of milk.

505
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:36,469
[laughter]

506
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:40,473
Well, everybody's afraid
of something, right?

507
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:42,342
Julie said you're afraid
of everything.

508
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,313
Mr. Monk, I really--
I'm--

509
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:47,614
Have you ever caught
a real killer?

510
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:49,282
Oh yes.

511
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:50,783
Oh...

512
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:53,720
yes, I've caught
a lot of killers.

513
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,289
Some killers are very smart.

514
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:59,992
And some are very powerful.

515
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:01,728
Some are even famous.

516
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,897
They don't think
they will ever be caught.

517
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:08,034
But in the end,

518
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,536
they...

519
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,070
they're always caught.

520
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,441
And I'll tell you why.

521
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:17,076
Because the police

522
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,079
can make mistakes.

523
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:24,617
I make mistakes
all the time.

524
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:25,918
But, uh...

525
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,587
but...

526
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:34,994
See, a-a killer
has to be, uh...

527
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,335
[laughter]

528
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:45,905
A killer has to be perfect.

529
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,340
And, uh...

530
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:51,844
nobody's perfect.

531
00:21:57,384 --> 00:22:01,020
The first police officers
appeared in ancient Rome

532
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:04,023
in 200 B.C.

533
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,993
They were called
Centurions.

534
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,962
In many ways, they were like
our modern police force.

535
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,665
It was their job to--to--

536
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:18,971
to enforce laws
and to--to maintain order.

537
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,007
They were, uh, chosen

538
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,642
for their...

539
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:26,713
their loyalty

540
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:28,515
and their courage.

541
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:29,749
Aaaaah!

542
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:30,917
Ah! Ah!

543
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,719
[laughter]

544
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:39,426
Here, Mr. Monk.

545
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,461
Drink that.
Are you okay?

546
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:44,464
Oh.

547
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:46,132
That was a good,
good speech.

548
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:49,101
I think the kids
learned a lot.

549
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:51,103
Are they still laughing?

550
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:53,072
They'll have to stop soon.

551
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,607
The period's almost over.

552
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:57,109
I am such a...

553
00:22:57,143 --> 00:22:58,611
what do you call it?

554
00:22:58,645 --> 00:23:01,781
Wuss. No, Mr. Monk,
you are not a wuss.

555
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,783
Well, I'm not a man.

556
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,518
I know that.

557
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:06,986
I'm a mutant.

558
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,922
I'm half man,
half wuss.

559
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:11,157
I'm a muss.

560
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,825
Here you are.
Our brave centurion.

561
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,160
I liked your speech.

562
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:15,862
Especially the little
dance number at the end.

563
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,097
Those laser pointers
can be very dangerous.

564
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:18,965
Yeah. They're a real menace.

565
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:20,900
I hear you've been
checking up on me.

566
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,068
Calling Joanne's family.

567
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,135
Her publisher.
Turning over rocks.

568
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:24,537
If you want to talk
to me,

569
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:28,608
let's talk right now
man to muss.

570
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:33,012
Did you hit her?

571
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:35,081
Hit who?
Joanne.

572
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:36,616
Did you hit her so hard

573
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,050
that she woke up
in the hospital?

574
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,586
I wouldn't repeat that,
Mr. Monk.

575
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:40,920
That's slander.

576
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:43,089
Besides,
who would believe it?

577
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:46,125
That's why you killed her,
isn't it?

578
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,094
Because she was about
to go public.

579
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:51,564
She was about to tell
the truth about you.

580
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,733
You're a sad little man.

581
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,002
I can't believe you and I
breathe the same air.

582
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,670
I was on a space ship,
Mr. Monk,

583
00:23:57,704 --> 00:24:00,006
circling the Earth
with my crew.

584
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:02,141
Why doesn't that satisfy?

585
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:06,679
Am I making you nervous?

586
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:10,182
Never. You know why?

587
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:12,151
[snap]
See.

588
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,486
You flinched.

589
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,821
See, you're a flincher.

590
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:18,124
You'll never stop me

591
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:19,992
because when the chips
are down when it really counts,

592
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:23,162
you are always
going to flinch.

593
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,033
Sir, sorry to interrupt.

594
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,234
We have to go.

595
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:30,202
Would you excuse us?
The Governor's waiting.

596
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:38,177
My God. You were right.

597
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,880
He killed her.

598
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:44,116
That was almost
a confession.

599
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,619
But how?

600
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:48,821
How did he do it?

601
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:56,729
And they were just toys.

602
00:24:56,763 --> 00:24:58,765
Little red flashlights.

603
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:01,701
But I was terrified.

604
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,203
I wanted to scream.

605
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:07,840
What--what did you do?

606
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:11,310
I screamed.

607
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,145
At least I heard screaming.

608
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,082
Pretty sure it was me.

609
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:17,617
Adrian, you were giving
a speech

610
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,018
in front of a group
of people.

611
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,153
That's real progress.

612
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,089
No, really.
I'm very proud of you.

613
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:24,557
Yeah.

614
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:28,160
You're never going to be
completely free of fear.

615
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,629
You can't expect that.

616
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:31,931
But real courage is being
afraid of something

617
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:33,065
and doing it anyway.

618
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:35,067
Nah.
What?

619
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:37,604
Steve Wagner...

620
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:40,072
said the exact same thing.

621
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:42,742
Really?

622
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:45,144
The astronaut.

623
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:50,049
Doctor,
killed his girlfriend.

624
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:53,085
Which I do not condone.
It's indefensible, of course.

625
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:57,624
Seems I'm afraid
all the time.

626
00:25:57,657 --> 00:26:01,060
I'm so tired
of being afraid.

627
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,129
Adrian.

628
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,097
I'm anxious to talk
about your phobias.

629
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:07,700
We talked
about aversion therapy.

630
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:09,001
Okay.

631
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:12,004
Let--let's--let's do it.
Let's do it.

632
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:13,305
Right now.
Okay. Okay. All right.

633
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:14,841
Here we go.
All right.

634
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:18,177
Which of your fears would you
like to work on first?

635
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,046
Glaciers.

636
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,248
No.

637
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:25,051
Rodeos.

638
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,853
Ah, glaciers. Glaciers.

639
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:30,022
All right, why don't we just
start with a basic one?

640
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:32,191
Fear of heights.

641
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,860
Okay. Heights.
Heights.

642
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:35,962
Let's do it. Heights.
Okay, good.

643
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:37,363
Let's get up
on the roof right now.

644
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:39,031
Wait. Whoa. Okay.
Wait, wait.

645
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:40,166
Sit.
I'll sit.

646
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,068
Sit down.

647
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,771
Okay, I'm down.
Sitting down.

648
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:47,674
Not--I'm not ready.

649
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:49,676
For that.

650
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:52,311
Uh...

651
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,181
let's--let's just build
up to it gradually.

652
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:58,751
Here's what.

653
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,053
Why don't we sit here

654
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:06,225
and, uh,
name really tall things.

655
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:10,697
I'll go first.

656
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,164
The Sears Tower.

657
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:16,703
Mm. Okay, wait,
wait, wait.

658
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:19,338
Mm. No. That's too tall.

659
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:22,308
Um, not the Sears Tower.

660
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:24,777
Just a regular Sears maybe.

661
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:29,215
Just a regular Sears.

662
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:31,150
Department store.

663
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:33,385
Adrian, why don't we work
on your phobias another time,

664
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:34,687
okay?

665
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,158
Okay.

666
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:46,065
When I--when I look
at a man--

667
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:50,837
a real man
like Steve Wagner...

668
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:55,241
I just feel weak.

669
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:59,111
I just feel so inadequate.

670
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:02,281
I know he's guilty.

671
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:06,252
But I'll never be able
to prove it.

672
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:08,454
Adrian,

673
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,990
Steve Wagner
is a human being.

674
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,125
And if he's guilty,

675
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:16,162
I know something
he's very much afraid of.

676
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,297
What's that?

677
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,833
You.

678
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:40,252
She's in the house.

679
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:43,255
He was up there

680
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:46,125
in space.

681
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:48,160
Circling the Earth.

682
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:51,030
Maybe he had
an accomplice.
No.

683
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,865
We have statements
from all of the neighbors.

684
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:55,334
There were no visitors,
no cars.

685
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:58,304
She was definitely alone.

686
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:03,876
Somehow he killed her
from up there.

687
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,178
Well, she collected
a lot of dolls.

688
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:09,181
Lot of really
ugly dolls.

689
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:11,150
Natalie.

690
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:12,451
Holes.

691
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,821
How did we miss that?

692
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:17,890
They were drilled
recently.

693
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:20,426
She wasn't killed
out there.

694
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:21,527
She was killed in here.

695
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,364
She was found in there.

696
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:30,069
She could've been killed
someplace else.

697
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,905
[bushes rustling]

698
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,181
Speak of the devil.

699
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:43,816
Sorry. I didn't know
anyone was here.

700
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,518
Are you looking
for something?

701
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:49,521
I wanted a flower
from her garden.

702
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:53,125
She loved this garden.

703
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:56,162
I cared for the girl.
I won't deny that.

704
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:58,497
You came a long way
to pick a flower.

705
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,132
Actually, I was heading
up here anyway.

706
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:02,835
I have a test flight
at Paxton in a couple of hours.

707
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:04,570
Now it's your turn.
What are you doing here?

708
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,238
I'm investigating
Joanne's murder.

709
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:08,240
Her suicide.

710
00:30:08,274 --> 00:30:09,876
It was murder.

711
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:12,945
I think we both know that.

712
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,213
(Cain)
Come on, man.

713
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:15,147
Are you deaf?

714
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:16,849
Please, just close
the damn garage door.

715
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:18,317
Well, I did.
Three times!

716
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,220
Well, guess what.
It's open again.

717
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:23,155
Well, maybe it's broke.

718
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:25,624
It ain't broke.
It's brand-new.

719
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,093
Holy son of a--
Look at this.

720
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:30,396
Hey, you know what,
I think that is.

721
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:31,931
Who?
The-- Who?

722
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:34,533
The--he's the--the guy.
The spaceman from TV.

723
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,602
He's famous.
Go get the camera would you?

724
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:38,337
Get the--get the--
Stay with your brother.

725
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,872
Go get the camera.

726
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:42,975
'Scuse me.

727
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:45,011
Uh, uh, uh, excuse me.

728
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:47,146
Uh, you--you're famous,
right?

729
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:50,482
You're that Steve
Wolanski--

730
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:51,583
Wagner.
Steven Wagner.

731
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:53,585
Wagner. I knew that.
Wagner.

732
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:55,554
You're the space
cowboy, right?

733
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,223
Oh, man, you're--

734
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:58,891
you're the dude
that landed the space shuttle

735
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:00,159
when it was on fire.

736
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,360
That's correct.

737
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:03,062
I lost ten bucks
on that.

738
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:04,130
Sorry to disappoint you.

739
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:05,164
Would you excuse us?

740
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,198
We're in the middle
of something.

741
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:08,167
Could you excuse us,
please?

742
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:13,139
You folks live
across the street.

743
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:14,340
Is that, right?

744
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:17,209
Huh? Yeah.
It's us right over here.

745
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:19,211
Yeah, that's right,
how are you, man?

746
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:20,279
Good to meet you.
I'm Darrel.

747
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,614
This is my daughter Donna here
and this is, uh...

748
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:23,983
Hi, nice to meet you.

749
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:25,117
Benny.

750
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:26,385
What the hell
are you doing here?

751
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,155
You're curious,
aren't you?

752
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:30,556
That's the best thing
a boy can have.

753
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,959
Curiosity.

754
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:35,427
I was friends
with the lady that lived here.

755
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:37,496
Oh, man.
That's a shame.

756
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:40,432
That's...
that's heart breaking.

757
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:43,069
Can we get a picture?

758
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:44,136
I can do better than that.

759
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,471
I'm flight testing
a brand-new jet

760
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:47,139
in a couple of hours.

761
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:48,407
How'd you like
to come and watch?

762
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,277
Bring the whole family.
Be my guests.

763
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,578
What, are you--
you kidding me?

764
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:54,113
They wouldn't mind?

765
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:55,414
You have every right
to be there.

766
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,149
You're a tax payer,
right?

767
00:31:57,183 --> 00:31:58,384
Yeah.

768
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,485
Sales tax.

769
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:01,020
Could we come too?

770
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:04,423
I'm a big aviation buff,
fan.

771
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:07,126
(Natalie)
That's so true.

772
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:08,127
Such a fanatic.

773
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,229
I love airplanes.
Just crazy
about the, uh...

774
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,131
Can't get enough of them.
The takeoff.

775
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:14,300
(Monk)
And the wings and all.

776
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:15,434
There we go.
The rudder.

777
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:16,568
(Natalie)
And that--the landing.

778
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:19,938
You wouldn't mind
if we come see you.

779
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,180
(Wagner)
Talking about state-of-the-art
technology here.

780
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:30,582
The most advanced war planes
ever built.

781
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,451
Some of these planes
are prototypes.

782
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:34,020
That means nobody's ever

783
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:35,187
flown 'em before.

784
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:35,954
(Cain)
Sounds dangerous.

785
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:37,656
(Wagner)
It can be dangerous.

786
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,258
Then why do you do it?

787
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,193
If I didn't do it, Benny,
somebody else would.

788
00:32:41,227 --> 00:32:43,129
Where's the fun in that?

789
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:44,997
Now you kids
will love this.

790
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:46,232
This is a flight simulator.

791
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:48,400
It's kind of like
a $30 million video game.

792
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:49,568
Cool.

793
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:51,270
Want to check it out?
Okay.

794
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,204
You grown-ups
stay here.

795
00:32:52,238 --> 00:32:53,305
We'll be right back.

796
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:56,208
Captain Savo,
you're in charge.

797
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:01,280
He is good people.

798
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,615
Yeah. He is good people.

799
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,617
Hey, how well
do you know him?

800
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,453
Well enough to wonder
what he's doing.

801
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,321
Let's go in.

802
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:12,791
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

803
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,293
That's a little dark
in there.

804
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,462
Let's just wait out here
for awhile.

805
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:20,366
(man)
Paulie!

806
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,201
Why is this
garage door open?

807
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:23,302
Don't know, Serge.

808
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,204
Opened by itself.
Maybe we installed it wrong.

809
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:26,672
I got the same problem
with my garage.

810
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:29,375
It's like an epidemic.

811
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:34,746
Natalie, I know
how he did it.

812
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,148
I know how he killed her!

813
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:38,550
It's all about
the garage doors.

814
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:39,685
It is?
Yes.

815
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:41,187
Dad.

816
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,288
Daddy!

817
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:43,222
Where's Mr. Wagner?

818
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:45,457
He left. He said
he was late for something.

819
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:46,625
What's wrong, sweetie?

820
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:48,294
(Benny)
The astronaut
took her doll.

821
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:50,196
He took her doll?

822
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:51,163
That's it!

823
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:54,166
Natalie,
it's all about the doll!

824
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,202
You just said it was all
about the garage door.

825
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:58,404
It's about the doll
and the garage door.

826
00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:00,539
It's about both.

827
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:09,348
Mr. Cain, where did you
get that doll?

828
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,183
I...

829
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:12,651
Come on.
You stole it, didn't you?

830
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:15,121
It was in a box sitting
on Joanne's front porch.

831
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:16,655
And you took it
just like you took

832
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:17,656
the Fruit of Month box.

833
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:19,825
It was sitting there
for three days, all right?

834
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:21,193
I figured she wasn't home.

835
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:22,494
You're a horrible neighbor.

836
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:25,431
(Donna cries)

837
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:28,367
Honey, it's gonna be
all right.

838
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,202
It's gonna be okay.

839
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:33,339
It's gonna be all right.
Sweetie, come on.

840
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:39,278
This is Captain Savo.

841
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:40,712
I just lost two
of my civilians.

842
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:42,314
Notify the law enforcement
desk.

843
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:43,615
Thank you.

844
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:46,118
The Captain's on his way.

845
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:47,286
We have to find Wagner

846
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:48,787
before he gets rid
of that doll.

847
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,889
Monk, I don't understand.

848
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,524
Here's what happened.

849
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:54,160
Before he left...

850
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:55,627
Wagner must've gone
to Joanne's house.

851
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:58,630
He drugged her
but not enough to kill her.

852
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:00,166
Just enough
to knock her out

853
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,467
for a couple of days.

854
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,303
Then he built a machine--
a murder machine--

855
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:06,472
a machine that would
hang her on Wednesday

856
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:09,308
long after he was gone.

857
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:11,177
What kind of machine?

858
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,811
Garage door opener.

859
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,546
He left her there drugged.

860
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,547
Probably tied up.

861
00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:16,548
And then took off

862
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:17,549
into space with

863
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:19,485
the whole world
watching.

864
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,857
Mr. Monk,
what are you doing?

865
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:27,693
I don't know.

866
00:35:29,228 --> 00:35:30,696
He's handling
the missiles.

867
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:32,298
No, no, no, no.

868
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:34,333
Those are missiles.
They could be nuclear weapons!

869
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:38,204
Then stop me
for the love of God.

870
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:45,311
I don't understand.

871
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,578
She died on Wednesday.

872
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:48,180
How did he activate
the machine?

873
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:49,481
It was so simple,
it was brilliant!

874
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:51,683
He used a remote control.

875
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:53,785
He taped it
or glued it down

876
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,821
so it stayed on.

877
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,489
Then he put the remote
control

878
00:35:57,523 --> 00:35:59,725
inside one of those dolls.

879
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:01,593
Then he mailed it
to her own house

880
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:02,928
second day mail.

881
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:04,796
Second day mail?
Wednesday morning.

882
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,865
Exactly.
It was like a time bomb.

883
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,768
The mail man
delivered the remote control,

884
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:11,303
put it on the front porch.

885
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:12,738
On the other side
of that door,

886
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:14,906
she was being strangled.

887
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,276
(Natalie)
Oh my God.

888
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:19,378
But they found her
in the living room!

889
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:21,647
After he landed,
Wagner went back to her house.

890
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,914
He dismantled the machine

891
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,750
and moved her body
into the other room.

892
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:26,952
It was a perfect plan
except for one thing.

893
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:28,787
The doll was missing.

894
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,256
It wasn't
on the front porch.

895
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:31,990
He must've panicked.

896
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,593
He went back there again today
to try to find it.

897
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:36,695
He knew that remote
could tie him to the murder.

898
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:38,697
His fingerprints
are all over it.

899
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,998
'Scuse me! Hi.

900
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,367
Hey, looking good.

901
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,269
Hi, Mr. We're looking
for Steve Wagner.

902
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:44,803
He may be
on the flight line.

903
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,438
I think they just cleared him
for takeoff.

904
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:48,740
Great. We'd love to watch.
Which way?

905
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:49,808
You can't miss him.

906
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:51,343
He's in the brand-new FA22.

907
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:54,846
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

908
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,981
Yeah, hi.

909
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:57,749
Hello again.

910
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:58,950
Could you settle a bet?

911
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:00,886
My friend and I
were wondering if, uh,

912
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:03,021
somebody
could drop anything

913
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,557
out of the cockpit
of an FA22.

914
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:07,025
Of course,
I say no way.

915
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,994
Of course you can.

916
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,662
Like what?

917
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:12,631
Uh, you know,
a Japanese doll.

918
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:13,799
About this big.

919
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:15,867
Well, there's an air lock.

920
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,336
Like a chute

921
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:18,337
to drop flares
and emergency transmitters.

922
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,938
I owe you one.
Go figure.

923
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,373
Thank you.
That's unbelievable.

924
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:22,708
Hey, wait a second.

925
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,976
Hey, where's your escort?

926
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,546
Hey, where you going?
Go, go, go!

No, no, no, Mr. Monk!
Wait!

00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:13,725
Hey!

930
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:17,929
Hey!

931
00:38:20,566 --> 00:38:22,868
Pull it over!

932
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:52,998
Put your hands
on your head.

933
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,766
Get on your knees.

934

from the jet.

937
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:04,042
Step away from the jet.

Stop! They're friendly!
They're friendly!

00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:13,018
That's my man out there.
Pack your weapons.

Captain, please hand me
the item.

00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:59,631
The doll, sir.
Hand me the doll.

secure the suspect.

948
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,691
Helped the suspect.
Now secure the air craft.

949
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,767
Control, suspect secure.

950
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:57,489
Come on.

951
00:40:57,523 --> 00:40:59,491
Mr. Monk.

952
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:01,760
Julie made something
for you.

953
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:02,928
What?

954
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,763
Well, all my friends
at school

955
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,598
were talking about
what you did

956
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:09,200
and how we were so wrong
about Mr. Wagner.

957
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:11,169
And how you caught him.

958
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:12,638
Well, um,

959
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:14,706
anyways, I made you this
in art class.

960
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:18,577
Oh. Julie.

961
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,211
It's a medal of valor.

962
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:21,780
Cause you're the bravest man

963
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:24,049
I've ever known
except for my father.

964
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:25,917
Oh, sweetie.

965
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:27,285
I'm going to get
the camera.

966
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,287
Well, I--

967
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,089
Julie, thank you.

968
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,625
Wait, wait a minute.

969
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,193
What is that? A pin?
Is that a pin?

970
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:36,595
Yeah, it's okay.
I'll be careful.

971
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:37,596
Wait, wait.
That--that--you know, that--

972
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:40,098
That can puncture the skin.
People get infected.

973
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:43,034
I'll just hold it.
How about that?

974
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:44,536
Okay. Smile.

975
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,838
You too, Rambo.

976
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:48,039
Wait, look.
It says courage.

977
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:49,908
Yeah. I see that.
I see that.

978
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,777
Take--take the picture.

979
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:54,780
No flash. No flash.
Retinal scarring.
