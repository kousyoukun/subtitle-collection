1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:03,002
The countdown is under way here
at Edwards Air Force Base.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,734
The new experimental rocket plane,
which was developed by Altman Aerodynamics,

3
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:12,040
<i>is scheduled to launch tomorrow morning</i>
<i>at 7:30 Pacific Time.</i>

4
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:15,048
The four-man crew will be led
by a familiar face,

5
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:18,381
astronaut and civilian test pilot,
Steven Wagner.

6
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:21,114
<i>Wagner became a national hero</i>
<i>four years ago,</i>

7
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:25,147
<i>when he made</i>
<i>a courageous emergency landing</i> <i>in the space shuttle during reentry.</i>

8
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:28,423
A national hero
in my very own living room.

9
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:31,465
- But I'll never be a hero to you, will I?
- You were once.

10
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,600
<i>[Steven]</i>
<i>Is this it?</i> <i>Uh-huh.</i>

<i>Between the Sheets:</i>
<i>TheJoanne Raphelson Story.</i>

12
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:42,375
You wanna read it?
You're Chapter Five. How many chapters are there?

13
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:45,276
Fifteen.
Wow. You've been a busy girl, Joanne.

14
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:48,679
[Laughs]
And that's only Volume One.

15
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,774
You really went into detail?

16
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,411
My editor insisted on it.
The juicier, the better.

17
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:57,423
<i>That's why I called you, Steve.</i>
<i>I didn't want you to be surprised.</i>

18
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,982
I appreciate that, Joanne.

19
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:06,600
I really do.

20
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:11,764
So, has anyone seen this
new version yet? Not yet.

21
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:15,468
When do you hand it in?
Next week. I'm still proofreading it.

22
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:18,011
Cheers.

23
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,741
Oh.
[Laughs]

24
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:23,340
An olive, a cherry and an onion?
What do you call this?

25
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,544
A Spacewalk.
It's my own recipe.

26
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,383
It's a good name.
I feel like I'm flying.

27
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:30,515
Oh.

28
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:34,118
So, do you wanna read it?
I plan to. That's why I'm here.

29
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:37,164
But... I've changed my mind.
Oh.

30
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,529
Hell, I've been a test pilot
for 15 years.

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,194
I once landed a space shuttle
in the ocean.

32
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,965
I think I can handle
whatever's in Chapter Five.

33
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,132
So hand it in.
Hit me with your best shot.

34
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,438
Thank you, Steve.

35
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:54,344

41

42

Your job.
Yeah.

Yeah. L-I can't do it.
I'm sorry.

[Stammers] See, that's not true.

Remember when I first started working

72
00:04:01,512 --> 00:04:04,913
There were 103 things.
Public speaking wasn't one of them.

73
00:04:04,982 --> 00:04:07,075
There were a couple of things
that I didn't mention.

74
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:10,279
I didn't want you to think I was weird.
Why don't you ask the captain?

She comes in every other week.

She found the body right here
couple hours ago.

<i>I found a letter from</i>
<i>a publisher in New York.</i>

She was about

91
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:10,545
And a check for 50 grand,
which she has not deposited.

92
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:12,605
Pretty weird time
to hang yourself, huh?

00:05:12,683 --> 00:05:17,017
Good work, sir.
You don't have to sound so surprised, Randy.

94
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:20,955
Oh. I'm not surprised.
I'm awestruck.

95
00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:26,390
Awestruck.
Well, don't be. And that's an order.

96
00:05:26,463 --> 00:05:30,024
You're ordering me not to be awestruck?
That's right. Stand over there, and don't be awestruck.

97
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,034
Yes, sir.

98
00:05:35,406 --> 00:05:39,069
Anything else?
Uh, yeah. Looks like her computer's missing.

99
00:05:39,143 --> 00:05:43,170
There's a power strip
with a surge protector, a printer and no computer.

100

Excuse me, sir.

It's awesome.

Randy, why don't you go outside
and talk to the neighbors?

104
00:05:54,058 --> 00:05:57,585
Yes, sir.
It's awesome.

105
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:03,666
So, am I right?
Something's not kosher.

106
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,008
It's her driver's license.

107
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:14,010
How tall you think that stool is?

108
00:06:15,212 --> 00:06:19,376
Mmm, about 18 inches?

109
00:06:20,784 --> 00:06:22,718
The rope's 7'6".

110
00:06:24,288 --> 00:06:28,281
But according to her license,
she's only 5'5".

111
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:31,351
I'm 5'5".

112
00:06:31,428 --> 00:06:33,362
Step up.

113
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:38,692
You're right.

114
00:06:40,637 --> 00:06:43,105
It doesn't add up.

115
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,503
So, how long have you lived here?
Fifteen years.

116
00:06:47,578 --> 00:06:49,842
Maybe 14.
You know what? My old lady'd know that.

117
00:06:49,913 --> 00:06:53,314
You can ask her when she gets back.
If she's sober.

118
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:56,012
Mmm. Hey, you want
one of these? Nectarines?

119
00:06:56,086 --> 00:06:58,486
They're the perfect fruit.
There you go. Oh. Okay.

120
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:03,090
Now, why is the garage door
open again?

121
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,095
- Benny, what did I tell you about this?
- I didn't open it.

122
00:07:06,163 --> 00:07:08,723
- Really? Well, then, who did?
- Maybe Donna did it.

123
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,563
You ever think of that?
Your sister couldn't open up a box of crayons.

124

She's six years old,

125
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:16,565
Mr. Cain, I just have
a few more questions.

126
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,574
How well did you know
Miss Raphelson?

127
00:07:18,642 --> 00:07:22,169
Not as well as I wanted to,
if you get my drift.

128
00:07:22,246 --> 00:07:25,443
Hey, she was hot.
What a waste.

129
00:07:25,516 --> 00:07:27,882
Did she have any visitors last week?

130
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:31,318
Uh, say, Tuesday or Wednesday?
Mm-mmm. No.

131
00:07:31,388 --> 00:07:34,255
Nobody. Nobody.
Not as far as I recall anyway.

132
00:07:34,324 --> 00:07:37,259
Oh, for crying- Now the-
Hector's out!

133
00:07:37,327 --> 00:07:40,262
- Benny, could you go get
your dog, please? - Why should I?

134
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,264
Because you opened up the garage.

135
00:07:42,332 --> 00:07:46,564
<i>Hey, smart guy,</i>
<i>this is a police officer, right?</i>

136
00:07:46,637 --> 00:07:50,266
I could have him lock you up.
You think about that.

137
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,470
How's it going?
Captain, this is, uh, Darrell Cain.

140
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:06,782
Excuse me. That box
is addressed toJoanne Raphelson.

141
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:10,792
Yeah.
It was on her porch.

142
00:08:12,095 --> 00:08:14,620
Well, I'd heard she died.
I figured it was up for grabs.

143
00:08:14,698 --> 00:08:17,030
You can't just take mail
from somebody's porch.

144
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,864
Yeah, you can if it's fruit.

145
00:08:19,937 --> 00:08:22,633
The law doesn't apply to fruit
because it's perishable.

146
00:08:22,706 --> 00:08:25,903
Actually, sir,
the law does apply to fruit.

147
00:08:27,344 --> 00:08:29,312
Are you eating one?
No.

148
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:33,042
- I was just putting that back.
- Captain, you wanted to see her phone records.

149

Yeah.

No calls at all on Tuesday
or Monday?

Hello. This is Captain Leland Stottlemeyer,

Yeah. Hey.
Uh, is this a bad time?

158
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:15,120
Oh, no, no. Some friends
are throwing me a little party. It's sort of a tradition.

159
00:09:15,192 --> 00:09:17,592
Well, congratulations
on your flight.

160

Oh, hey, and, uh, congratulations
on that crash landing four years ago.

161
00:09:21,164 --> 00:09:23,758
Oh, and, uh, marrying
a figure skater.

165
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,533
Monk. I know that name.

166
00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:36,545
You're the detective,
the one who quit.

167
00:09:36,613 --> 00:09:39,173
No, l-I didn't quit, uh, exactly.

168
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:41,649
It was a- It was
a kind of a leave of absence.

169
00:09:41,718 --> 00:09:45,154
It's nothing to be ashamed of, Mr. Monk.
Some people just can't handle the pressure.

170
00:09:45,222 --> 00:09:48,658
L-l-l-I didn't quit.
Mr. Wagner, I'm sorry.

171
00:09:48,725 --> 00:09:53,753
My daughter just wrote
a school paper about you. Good. I need all the P.R. I can get.

172
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,560
She's not gonna believe
that I met you. Do you mind if I take a picture?

173
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:58,726
Not at all.
Thank you.

174
00:09:58,802 --> 00:10:00,736
I'm-I'm not a quitter.
I didn't quit.

175
00:10:00,804 --> 00:10:03,500
There were
extenuating circumstances. There always are.

176
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:06,600
The trick is not to let them stop us.

177
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:11,778
- Captain, you said it was important.
- Oh, yeah. Um-

178
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:13,839
Do you know a woman
named Joanne Raphelson?

179
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,579
She's dead, isn't she?

180
00:10:18,655 --> 00:10:20,589
She finally did it.

181
00:10:21,992 --> 00:10:24,790
- You're not surprised.
- [Sighs]

182
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:27,796
Joanne's been depressed for months.
For years, really.

183
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:31,163
Was about to have a book published,
but somehow that made it worse.

184
00:10:31,234 --> 00:10:34,397
Like I was saying to Mr. Monk,
some people just can't handle the pressure.

185
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:37,269
It was a psychological discharge,
for God's sake. It's only temporary.

I plan on being reinstated.

How well did you know her?
Intimately.

188
00:10:43,347 --> 00:10:46,942
- When was the last time
you saw her? - Five years ago.

189
00:10:47,017 --> 00:10:51,351
No, wait. Uh, she called you
on the phone last week. That's true.

190
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:56,757
She calls me once or twice a year
when she's lonely, depressed or drunk, and sometimes all three.

191
00:10:56,827 --> 00:10:59,295
Steven? Honey,
we're cutting the cake.

Look, uh, we can talk
about this tomorrow, okay?

193
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:04,694
That's all right, Captain.
I have no secrets from my wife.

194
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:09,535
Honey, these gentlemen are detectives.
Joanne Raphelson is dead.

195

Oh, no. Poor girl.
I made a mistake, Captain.

Five years ago.
Nicole knows all about it.

My husband invented it.

00:11:27,658 --> 00:11:29,888
Is-Is-Is that an olive?

202
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,894
And an onion and a cherry.

203
00:11:31,962 --> 00:11:33,987
It's my claim to fame.
Would you like one?

204
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:37,397
No, thank you. Mr. Wagner,
I was reading about your flight.

205
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,628
They said they almost
had to cancel the liftoff.

206
00:11:39,703 --> 00:11:41,671
You were running late?
That's true.

207
00:11:41,738 --> 00:11:44,434
I got lost on my way to Edwards.
Can you believe it?

208
00:11:44,508 --> 00:11:47,238
You-You got lost?
I tried a different shortcut.

209
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,838
L-l-I guess I'm a better navigator
in the sky than I am on the highways.

210

Congressman,
glad you could make it. Steve!

211
00:11:54,951 --> 00:11:59,411
Hey, when are we gonna have
that talk about your future? The sooner, the better.

212
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:01,821
Will you excuse us?
Uh, my friends are waiting.

213
00:12:01,892 --> 00:12:03,826
We can talk about this
some other time? Absolutely.

214
00:12:03,894 --> 00:12:05,862
Great.
It was nice to meet you.

215
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:08,420
Nice to meet you.

216
00:12:08,498 --> 00:12:10,489
He's the guy.

217
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:15,130
Who's the guy?
The astronaut.

218
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:17,139
He killed her.

219
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:21,268
Somebody made that exact same drink
atJoanne Raphelson's house before she died.

220
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:24,245
Monk, it's not possible.
He was in space.

221
00:12:24,314 --> 00:12:28,341
He did it.
Outer space, Monk.

222
00:12:28,418 --> 00:12:31,285
He was on TV.
He was orbiting the Earth.

223
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:34,289
You gotta admit
it's a pretty good alibi.

224
00:12:36,493 --> 00:12:39,929
He- He's the guy.

225
00:12:52,677 --> 00:12:56,238
Monk, 99 times out of a hundred,
I am in your corner.

226
00:12:56,314 --> 00:13:01,752
But I just can't see it.
Steve Wagner is a national hero. It's true, Mr. Monk.

227
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,846
He was on the cover
of <i>Time</i> magazine. Actually, it was <i>Newsweek.</i>

228
00:13:04,923 --> 00:13:08,757
Actually, it was both. Now, look,
we need to tread carefully here.

229
00:13:08,827 --> 00:13:11,557
First off, there's no motive.
The wife knew about the affair.

230
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,996
A lot of people did.
But it wasn't just the affair.

231
00:13:14,065 --> 00:13:17,034
We just talked toJoanne Raphelson's
editor in New York.

232
00:13:17,102 --> 00:13:19,195
She was about to hand in
her next draft,

233
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:21,899
which contained a couple
of real bombshells.

234
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:26,273
- Like?
- Like, which of her ex-boyfriends beat her up five years ago.

235
00:13:26,344 --> 00:13:28,403
Somebody put her in the hospital.

236
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,711
She had a concussion, right?
Mm-hmm.

237
00:13:31,783 --> 00:13:33,808
And you think Steve Wagner's involved?

238
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:37,978
I just don't believe it.
I'm sorry, Mr. Monk.

239
00:13:39,558 --> 00:13:42,584
Look, Wagner wants
to run for office.

240
00:13:42,661 --> 00:13:45,152
A story like that would bury him.

241
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,688
Okay. Maybe you found a motive.
Maybe.

242
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:51,167
But it doesn't matter,
and I'll tell you why.

243
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:54,330
Because your suspect, Monk,
was in outer space.

244
00:13:54,406 --> 00:13:56,670
He wasn't on this planet.
It's true.

245
00:13:56,741 --> 00:13:59,733

on television. The whole world was watching.

He took off on Monday,
and he landed on Friday.

247
00:14:03,582 --> 00:14:07,450
Here's the case file.
Now, the coroner is 100% sure.

248
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,081
He is certain thatJoanne Raphelson
died of ligature strangulation on Wednesday morning...

249
00:14:12,157 --> 00:14:14,250
while your man was in space.

250
00:14:15,994 --> 00:14:20,363
Now, maybe we should take a minute
and see if we can think of a better alibi.

251
00:14:43,154 --> 00:14:47,386
It's a pretty good alibi.
Yep.

252
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,654
She had drugs in her system?
Barbiturates.

253
00:14:49,728 --> 00:14:51,753
Yeah. Coroner said
she took some pills.

254
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,596
They didn't work,
she went to Plan "B" and dangled herself. It happens all the time.

255
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:58,465
But you said yourself,
the crime scene didn't look kosher.

256
00:14:58,536 --> 00:15:03,667
Yeah, Monk,
what I'm saying is it might be murder, but it wasn't him.

257
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:05,937
Captain, I think Monk's right.

Thank you!

Okay, this is the ship.

represents the Earth.

It does represent the Earth.

Right. Okay.

Well, wait. Uh, wait.

267
00:15:40,645 --> 00:15:44,274
Was there an escape pod
on the ship? No, not officially.

268
00:15:44,349 --> 00:15:47,443
But I think he smuggled one on.
Mm-hmm. And where did he get it- the escape pod?

269
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,953
He built it.

270
00:15:50,021 --> 00:15:52,285
Yeah, out of a kit.
In his basement.

271

He's resourceful.
Anyway, splashdown.

<i>Because when the landing gear</i>

00:17:26,551 --> 00:17:28,610
I knew what I had to do.

298
00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:33,623
I went around Florida-
good-bye, Florida- over Louisiana...

299
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:38,560
<i>and landed the space shuttle here</i>

And you weren't even scared?

301
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,962
No, I wasn't scared.
I was terrified!

302
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:47,630
- [Chuckling]
- People called me a hero.

303
00:17:47,705 --> 00:17:50,230
<i>But anybody</i>-
<i>anybody could have done that.</i>

304
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:55,268
You or you or you or you or...

305
00:17:57,148 --> 00:17:59,878
you or you.

306
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:04,455
Being brave is being afraid of something,
but doing it anyway.

307
00:18:06,491 --> 00:18:08,925
What are you gonna do next?

308
00:18:08,993 --> 00:18:12,827
Tomorrow, I'm testing a brand-new jet
for the air force called the F% A-22 Raptor.

309
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:14,831
It's the most advanced fighter
in the world.

310

<i>She's faster than the speed of sound,</i>

311
00:18:17,735 --> 00:18:21,296
so if you hear a big boom
in the sky tomorrow, that's me saying, "Hello, kids."

312
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:24,466
[Chuckling]
Before I go,

313
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:28,308
I brought some official Steve Wagner
laser pointers for all you kids.

314
00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:30,939
There you go. Take one,
pass them back.

315
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:36,009
Well, I had a great time. And remember,
what does Steve Wagner want you to do?

<i>Wasn't he great?</i> <i>Let's give him a hand.</i>

00:19:36,514 --> 00:19:38,448
I'm, uh-

328
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:42,843
I'm Adrian Monk.

329
00:19:44,856 --> 00:19:47,017
Who wants to be a detective
when they grow up?

330
00:19:52,997 --> 00:19:54,988
What about you?
No.

331
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:57,432
No?

332
00:19:57,502 --> 00:20:01,632
Everybody in your row
has their hand up, so-

333
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,374
If you put your hand up,
um, it would be a perfect row.

334
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,475
Put your hand up!

335
00:20:20,124 --> 00:20:24,584
- Where's your gun?
- Um, I, uh-

336
00:20:24,662 --> 00:20:29,099
- I don't- I don't have one.
- You can't carry one 'cause you had a breakdown.

337
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:32,728
<i>[Chuckling]</i>
Oh, well, uh-

- <i>Julie said you're afraid of milk.</i>
- [Chuckling]

339
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,076
Well, everybody's, uh-
everybody's afraid of something, right?

340
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:44,740
- Julie said you're afraid of everything.
- Mr. Monk, l- I really-

341
00:20:44,816 --> 00:20:47,250
<i>Have you ever caught a</i> real <i>killer?</i>

342
00:20:47,318 --> 00:20:50,446
Oh, yes. Oh.

343
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:53,957
Yes, I've caught a lot of killers.

344
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:59,588
Some killers are very smart,
and some are very powerful.

345
00:20:59,664 --> 00:21:04,727
Some are even famous.
They don't think they will ever be caught.

346
00:21:04,802 --> 00:21:08,033
But in the end,

347
00:21:08,106 --> 00:21:10,836
they- they are always caught.

348
00:21:10,908 --> 00:21:12,899
And I'll tell you why.

349
00:21:14,345 --> 00:21:20,306
Because the police
can make mistakes.

350
00:21:20,385 --> 00:21:24,185
I make mistakes all the time.

351
00:21:24,255 --> 00:21:27,224
But, uh- But-

[Chuckling]

See, a-a killer has to be,
uh- has to-

[Chuckling]

355
00:21:43,341 --> 00:21:46,742
A killer has to be perfect,
and, uh,

356
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,412
nobody's perfect.

357
00:21:57,055 --> 00:21:59,421
The first police officers appeared...

358
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,824
in, an- in ancient Rome in 200 B.C.

359
00:22:03,895 --> 00:22:06,830
They were called centurions.

360
00:22:06,898 --> 00:22:09,765
In many ways,
they were like our modern police force.

361
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:12,268
It was their job to- to-

362
00:22:12,337 --> 00:22:14,897
[Chuckling]
To enforce laws...

363

and to- and to maintain order.

Here, Mr. Monk.
Drink that.

369
00:22:40,298 --> 00:22:44,200
Are you okay?
Oh.

370
00:22:44,268 --> 00:22:46,668
That was a good, good speech.

371
00:22:46,738 --> 00:22:49,104
I think the kids learned a lot.

372
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:51,573
Yeah. They're-
They're still laughing.

373
00:22:51,642 --> 00:22:54,907
Well, they'll have to stop soon.
Period's almost over.

Oh, I am such a-
What do you call it?

375
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,777
Wuss. No, Mr. Monk,
you are not a wuss.

376
00:23:02,854 --> 00:23:05,482
Well, I'm not a man.
I know that.

I'm a "muss."
Here you are, our brave centurion.

379
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,463
I liked your speech,
especially the little dance number at the end.

380
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:17,728
Those laser pointers
can be very dangerous.

381
00:23:17,802 --> 00:23:20,464
Yeah, they're a real menace.
I hear you've been checking up on me-

382
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:23,029
calling Joanne's family,
her publisher, turning over rocks.

If you want to talk to me,
let's talk right now, man to "muss."

384
00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:33,844
Did you hit her?
Hit who?

385
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:37,820
Joanne. Did you hit her so hard
that she woke up in the hospital?

386
00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:39,982
I wouldn't repeat that, Mr. Monk.
That's slander.

387
00:23:40,057 --> 00:23:42,651
Besides, who would believe it?

388
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:47,858
But that's why you killed her, isn't it?
Because she was about to go public.

389
00:23:47,932 --> 00:23:51,129
She was about to tell the truth
about you.

390

You're a sad little man.
I can't believe you and I breathe the same air.

391
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:00,268
I was on a spaceship, Mr. Monk,
circling the Earth with my crew.

392
00:24:00,344 --> 00:24:03,040
Why doesn't that satisfy you?

393
00:24:03,114 --> 00:24:06,208
Am I making you nervous?

394
00:24:06,284 --> 00:24:09,720
Never. You know why?

[Snaps Fingers]
See?

396
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:14,383
You flinched.
See, you're a flincher.

397
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,956
You'll never stop me,
because when the chips are down,

398
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,898
when it really counts,
you are always going to flinch.

But how?

406
00:24:46,824 --> 00:24:48,951
How did he do it?

I mean, they were just toys-

You're never going to be
completely free of fear.

418

You can't expect that.

Uh, not- not the Sears Tower.

449
00:27:22,124 --> 00:27:24,319
Just a regular Sears, maybe.

450
00:27:25,661 --> 00:27:29,495
Just a regular Sears.
Mm-hmm.

451
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:34,229
Department store.
Adrian, why don't we work on your phobias another time, okay?

452
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:39,263
Okay.

453
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,544
[Sighs]

454
00:27:43,612 --> 00:27:46,809
When l-When I look at a man-

455
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:50,613
a real man like Steve Wagner-

456
00:27:53,522 --> 00:27:55,820
I just feel weak.

457
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:58,325
I just feel so inadequate.

458
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:04,958
I know he's guilty,
but I'll never be able to prove it.

459
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:10,801
Adrian, Steve Wagner
is a human being,

460
00:28:10,873 --> 00:28:15,833
and if he's guilty, I know something
he's very much afraid of.

461
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:18,175
What's that?

462
00:28:18,247 --> 00:28:20,442
You.

463
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,629
She's in the house.

464
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:46,265
He is up there in space...

465
00:28:46,341 --> 00:28:48,639
circling the Earth.

466
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,644
Maybe he had an accomplice.
No.

467
00:28:50,712 --> 00:28:52,771
We have statements
from all of the neighbors.

468
00:28:52,848 --> 00:28:55,544
There were no visitors, no cars.

469
00:28:55,617 --> 00:28:58,518
She was definitely alone.

470
00:28:58,587 --> 00:29:03,490
Somehow, he killed her
from up there.

471
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:06,892
Well, she collected a lot of dolls.

472
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:09,055
Lot of really ugly dolls.

473
00:29:09,131 --> 00:29:12,294
Natalie, holes.

474
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:14,460
How did we miss that?

475
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:17,562
They were drilled recently.

476
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:21,405
<i>So? She wasn't killed out there.</i>
<i>She was killed in here.</i>

477
00:29:21,476 --> 00:29:26,106
She was <i>found</i> in there,

478
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,742
but she could have been killed
someplace else.

479

<i>[Clanging]</i>

480

- Sorry. I didn't know anyone was here.

481
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:46,432
Are you looking for something?

482
00:29:46,501 --> 00:29:49,993
I wanted a flower
from her garden.

483
00:29:50,072 --> 00:29:52,063
She loved this garden.

484
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,033
I cared for the girl.
I won't deny that.

485
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:59,979
You came a long way
to pick a flower. <i>Actually, I was heading up here anyway.</i>

486
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,380
I have a test flight at Paxton
in a couple of hours.

487
00:30:02,451 --> 00:30:05,887
Now it's your turn.
What are you doing here? I'm investigating Joanne's murder.

488
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:08,115
Her suicide.

489
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:11,626
It was murder.
I think we both know that.

490

<i>Come on, man.!</i>
<i>Are you deaf? Please,</i> <i>Just close the damn garage door.!</i>

Well, I did, three times!

492
00:30:18,634 --> 00:30:20,864
Right! Well, guess what?
It's open again!

493
00:30:20,936 --> 00:30:22,961
<i>Well, maybe it's broke.!</i>
<i>It ain't broke.!</i>

494
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:26,872
It's brand-new!
Holy son of a- Look at this!

495
00:30:26,942 --> 00:30:29,467
<i>Look at him.!</i>
<i>He looks just like</i>-

I think that is. Who?

The-Who? The-
He's the- the guy, the- the spaceman from TV.

498
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,345
He's famous!
Go get the camera, would ya? Stay with your brother!

499
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,150
Go get the camera!
Uh, excuse me.

500
00:30:41,223 --> 00:30:44,556
Excuse me.
[Stammering] Excuse me.

501
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:47,720
Uh, you're-
You're famous, right?

502
00:30:47,796 --> 00:30:51,357
You're that, uh, Steve Walenski?
Wagner. Steven Wagner.

503
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,560
Wagner! That's-
I knew that.

504
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:55,830
Wagner!
You're the space cowboy, right?

505
00:30:55,904 --> 00:30:59,840
Oh, man!
You're that dude that landed the space shuttle when it was on fire!

506
00:30:59,908 --> 00:31:02,342
That's correct.
I lost 10 bucks on that.

507
00:31:02,411 --> 00:31:04,845
Sorry to disappoint you.
Would you excuse us?

508
00:31:04,913 --> 00:31:08,007
We're in the middle of something.
Could you excuse us, please?

509
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,587
You folks live across the street?
Is that right?

510
00:31:13,655 --> 00:31:17,056
How-Yeah, that's us.
Right over here.

511
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,355
That's right. How are you, man?
Hey, good to meet you.

512
00:31:19,428 --> 00:31:21,453
I'm- I'm Darrell.
This is my daughter Donna here,

513
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,693
and, well, this is Benny.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

514
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:27,394
What the hell are you doing here?
Would you-

515
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:32,532
You're curious, aren't you?
That's the best thing a boy can have- curiosity.

516
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:35,201
I was friends with the lady
that lived here.

517
00:31:35,277 --> 00:31:37,438
Oh, man.
That's a shame.

518
00:31:37,512 --> 00:31:40,640
That's-That's heartbreaking.

519
00:31:40,716 --> 00:31:44,015
Could we get a picture?
I can do better than that.

520
00:31:44,086 --> 00:31:48,216
I'm flight-testing a brand-new jet
in a couple of hours. How'd you like to come and watch?

521
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:52,692
Bring the whole family.
Be my guests. Are you-you kidding me?

522
00:31:52,761 --> 00:31:54,752
They wouldn't mind?
You have every right to be there.

523
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:59,267
- You're a taxpayer, right?
- Yeah. Sales tax.

524
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:04,237
Could we come too?
I'm a big aviation buff- fan.

Such a fanatic. Just-
I love airplanes.

00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,812
Crazy about the, uh-
Can't get enough of'em.

<i>[Natalie] And the landing.</i>
<i>[Monk]</i> <i>What do you call it? The rudder.</i>

530

The most advanced warplanes
ever built.

534
00:32:30,665 --> 00:32:34,658
Some of these planes are prototypes.
That means nobody's ever flown 'em.

535
00:32:34,736 --> 00:32:37,432
<i>[Darrell] It sounds dangerous.</i>
<i>[Wagner]</i> <i>It can be dangerous.</i>

536
00:32:37,506 --> 00:32:40,839
Then why do you do it?
If I didn't do it, Benny, somebody else would.

537
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:42,877
And where's the fun in that?

538
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:46,607
Now, you kids will love this.
This is a flight simulator.

539
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:49,445
It's kind of like
a 30-million-dollar video game. Cool!

540
00:32:49,518 --> 00:32:51,509
Want to check it out?
Okay.

541
00:32:51,586 --> 00:32:54,146
You grown-ups stay here.
We'll be right back.

Hey, how well you know him?

545
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,831
Well enough to wonder
what he's doing. Let's go in.

Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

550
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,152
[Scoffs]
I got the same problem with my garage.

That's it! Natalie,
it's all about the doll!

560
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:58,685
You said it was all about
the garage door! It's about the doll and the garage doors!

get that doll?

L-
Come on. You stole it, didn't you?

564
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:14,912
It was in a box
sitting on Joanne's front porch,

565
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:17,785
and you took it, just like you took
the Fruit of the Month box.

566
00:34:17,857 --> 00:34:19,950
It was sitting there
for three days, all right?

567
00:34:20,026 --> 00:34:22,460
I figured she wasn't home.

<i>Huh?</i>

This is Captain Savo.
I just lost two of my civilians. Notify the law enforcement desk.

00:34:43,616 --> 00:34:45,880
Okay, thank you.
Captain's on his way.

575

Before he left,

578
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:56,627
<i>Wagner must have</i>
<i>gone toJoanne's house.</i>

579
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:58,629
<i>He drugged her,</i>
<i>but not enough to kill her.</i>

580
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:01,666
<i>Just enough to knock her out</i>
<i>for a couple of days.</i>

581
00:35:01,734 --> 00:35:05,329
Then he built a machine-
a murder machine-

582
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:08,999
<i>a machine that would hang her on Wednesday,</i>
<i>long after he was gone.</i>

583
00:35:09,075 --> 00:35:12,943
What kind of machine?
A garage door opener.

584
00:35:13,012 --> 00:35:15,480
<i>He left her there drugged,</i>
<i>probably tied up,</i>

585
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:19,348
<i>and then took off into space</i>
<i>with the whole world watching.</i>

586
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:26,554
Mr. Monk,
what are you doing?

587
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,559
I don't know.

588
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,027
<i>They're at Ramp Two.</i>
<i>He's handling the missile.</i>

589
00:35:31,097 --> 00:35:33,031
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Those are missiles!

590
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:35,397
Th-Th-They could be nuclear weapons!

591
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:37,595
Then stop me,
for the love of God.

592
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:41,868
It's all right.
[Muttering] <i>[Alarm Blaring]</i>

She died on Wednesday. How did he activate the machine?

594
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,542
It was so simple,
it was brilliant. He used a remote control.

<i>He taped it or glued it down</i>
<i>so it stayed on.</i>

596
00:35:55,855 --> 00:35:59,689
<i>Then he put the remote control</i>
<i>inside one of those dolls.</i>

597
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:02,852
<i>Then he mailed it to her own house</i>
<i>second-day mail.</i>

598
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:05,021
<i>Second-day mail.</i>
<i>Wednesday morning.!</i>

599
00:36:05,097 --> 00:36:07,031
Exactly.
It was like a time bomb.

600
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:11,035
- <i>The mailman delivered the remote control,</i>
<i>put it on the front porch.</i> - <i>[Beeps]</i>

601
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:14,869
<i>On the other side of that door,</i>
<i>she was being strangled.</i>

602
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:19,639
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>But they found her in the living room.</i>

603
00:36:19,712 --> 00:36:22,078
After he landed,
Wagner went back to her house.

604
00:36:22,148 --> 00:36:24,912
He dismantled the machine
and moved her body into the other room.

605
00:36:24,984 --> 00:36:27,248
It was a perfect plan,
except for one thing.

606
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:29,549
<i>The doll was missing.!</i>

607
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:33,718
<i>He must have panicked.</i>
<i>He went back there again</i> <i>today to find it.</i>

608
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,852
<i>He knows that remote</i>
<i>can tie him to the murder.</i>

609
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:40,490
His fingerprints are all over it.
Excuse me. Hi.

610
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:43,228
Hey, nice ride.
Hi. Listen, we're looking for Steve Wagner.

611
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:46,396
He may be on the flight line.
I think they just cleared him for takeoff.

612
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:48,702
Great. We'd love to watch.
Which way?

613
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:52,710
You can't miss him.
He's in a brand-new F% A-22.

614
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:57,738
Oh. Uh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Hi. Hi. Hello again.

615
00:36:57,816 --> 00:37:01,411
Could you settle a bet?
My friend and I were wondering if, uh,

616
00:37:01,487 --> 00:37:06,151
somebody could drop anything
out of the cockpit of an F% A-22?

617
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:08,921
Of course, uh, I say no way.
Of course you can!

618
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:12,725
Like what?
Uh, you know, a Japanese doll.

619
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:17,030
- About this big.
- Well, there's an air lock, like a chute,

620
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:19,036
to drop flares
and emergency transmitters.

621
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,265
I owe you one. Go figure.
Thank you!

622
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,535
<i>[Monk] That's unbelievable.</i>
<i>You win that one.</i> Wait a second.

623
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:26,077
- Hey, where's your escort?
- Just go. Just go, go, go!

No, no, no!
Mr. Monk, wait!

627
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:10,979
Wait up! Wagner!

628
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:13,616
Hey! Hey!

629
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:18,753
Hey! Hey!

Mr. Monk,
Julie made something for you.

644
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:06,509
What?
Well, all my friends at school were talking about what you did...

645
00:41:06,587 --> 00:41:09,055
and how we were so wrong
about Mr. Wagner...

646
00:41:09,123 --> 00:41:11,250
and how you caught him.

647
00:41:11,325 --> 00:41:14,783
Well, um, anyways,
I made you this in art class.

648
00:41:16,296 --> 00:41:20,062
Oh, Julie.
It's a Medal of Valor,

649
00:41:20,134 --> 00:41:23,900
'cause you're the bravest man
I've ever known, except for my father.

650
00:41:23,971 --> 00:41:27,099
Oh, sweetie.
I'm gonna get the camera.

651
00:41:28,175 --> 00:41:32,009
Well, l-Julie, thank you.
L-I mean, thank you.

652
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,946
What is that? A pin?
Yeah, it's okay. I'll be careful.

653
00:41:35,015 --> 00:41:38,644
Yeah, don't-Wait, wait, wait.
You know, that- that can puncture the skin.

654
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:40,653
People get infected.
I'll just hold it.

655
00:41:40,721 --> 00:41:42,746
How about that?
That's just as good. Okay.

Okay. Smile.
You too, Rambo.

It says "courage." Yeah, I see that.

I see that.
Take- take the picture.
