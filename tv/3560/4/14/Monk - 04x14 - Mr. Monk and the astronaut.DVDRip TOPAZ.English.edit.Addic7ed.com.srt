1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:04,002
The countdown is under way here
at Edwards Air Force Base.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,734
The new experimental rocket plane,
which was developed
by Altman Aerodynamics,

3
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:13,040
<i>is scheduled to launch tomorrow morning</i>
<i>at 7:30 Pacific Time.</i>

4
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:16,048
The four-man crew will be led
by a familiar face,

5
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:19,381
astronaut and civilian test pilot,
Steven Wagner.

6
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:22,114
<i>Wagner became a national hero</i>
<i>four years ago,</i>

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:26,147
<i>when he made</i>
<i>a courageous emergency landing</i>
<i>in the space shuttle during reentry.</i>

8
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:29,423
A national hero
in my very own living room.

9
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,465
- But I'll never be a hero to you, will I?
- You were once.

10
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,600
<i>[Steven]</i>
<i>Is this it?</i>
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

11
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:39,866
<i>Between the Sheets:</i>
<i>TheJoanne Raphelson Story.</i>

12
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:43,375
You wanna read it?
You're Chapter Five.
How many chapters are there?

13
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:46,276
Fifteen.
Wow.
You've been a busy girl, Joanne.

14
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:49,679
[Laughs]
And that's only Volume One.

15
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,774
You really went into detail?

16
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:54,411
My editor insisted on it.
The juicier, the better.

17
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:58,423
<i>That's why I called you, Steve.</i>
<i>I didn't want you to be surprised.</i>

18
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,982
I appreciate that, Joanne.

19
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,600
I really do.

20
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:12,764
So, has anyone seen this
new version yet?
Not yet.

21
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:16,468
When do you hand it in?
Next week.
I'm still proofreading it.

22
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,011
Cheers.

23
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,741
Oh.
[Laughs]

24
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,340
An olive, a cherry and an onion?
What do you call this?

25
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,544
A Spacewalk.
It's my own recipe.

26
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:29,383
It's a good name.
I feel like I'm flying.

27
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,515
Oh.

28
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,118
So, do you wanna read it?
I plan to.
That's why I'm here.

29
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,164
But... I've changed my mind.
Oh.

30
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,529
Hell, I've been a test pilot
for 15 years.

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,194
I once landed a space shuttle
in the ocean.

32
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,965
I think I can handle
whatever's in Chapter Five.

33
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,132
So hand it in.
Hit me with your best shot.

34
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,438
Thank you, Steve.

35
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,344

Your job.
Yeah.

68
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:52,187

Yeah. L-I can't do it.
I'm sorry.

[Stammers]
See, that's not true.

Remember when I first started working
for you, and you made that list
of all your fears and phobias?

72
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,942
There were 103 things.
Public speaking wasn't one of them.

73
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,104
There were a couple of things
that I didn't mention.

74
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,308
I didn't want you to think I was weird.
Why don't you ask the captain?

<i>[Monk Coughing]</i>

She comes in every other week.

78

She found the body right here
couple hours ago.

Her name is, uh,
Joanne Raphelson, 36.

Wednesday morning.
Wednesday?

83
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,737

I wanted to run 'em by you.

<i>I found a letter from</i>
<i>a publisher in New York.</i>

87
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,123
She was about
to have a book published.

88
00:04:56,195 --> 00:05:00,859
A memoir called

91
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:10,574
And a check for 50 grand,
which she has not deposited.

92
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,634
Pretty weird time
to hang yourself, huh?

93
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:17,046
Good work, sir.
You don't have to sound
so surprised, Randy.

94
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:20,984
Oh. I'm not surprised.
I'm awestruck.

95
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:26,419
Awestruck.
Well, don't be.
And that's an order.

96
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:30,053
You're ordering me not to be awestruck?
That's right. Stand over there,
and don't be awestruck.

97
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,063
Yes, sir.

98
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:39,098
Anything else?
Uh, yeah.
Looks like her computer's missing.

99
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:43,199
There's a power strip
with a surge protector,
a printer and no computer.

100
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,506
Excuse me, sir.

101
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:49,446
Sorry. I've never disobeyed
an order in my life.

102
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,449
It's really good work.
It's awesome.

103
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,008
Randy, why don't you go outside
and talk to the neighbors?

104
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:57,614
Yes, sir.
It's awesome.

105
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:03,695
So, am I right?
Something's not kosher.

106
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,037
It's her driver's license.

107
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,039
How tall you think that stool is?

108
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:19,405
Mmm, about 18 inches?

109
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,747
The rope's 7'6".

110
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:28,310
But according to her license,
she's only 5'5".

111
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,380
I'm 5'5".

112
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,391
Step up.

113
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,721
You're right.

114
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,134
It doesn't add up.

115
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,532
So, how long have you lived here?
Fifteen years.

116
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,871
Maybe 14.
You know what?
My old lady'd know that.

117
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:53,343
You can ask her when she gets back.
If she's sober.

118
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,041
Mmm. Hey, you want
one of these? Nectarines?

119
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,515
They're the perfect fruit.
There you go.
Oh. Okay.

120
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:03,119
Now, why is the garage door
open again?

121
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,124
- Benny, what did I tell you about this?
- I didn't open it.

122
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,752
- Really? Well, then, who did?
- Maybe Donna did it.

123
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,592
You ever think of that?
Your sister couldn't open up
a box of crayons.

124
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,928
She's six years old,
for cryin' out loud.

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,594
Mr. Cain, I just have
a few more questions.

126
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,603
How well did you know
Miss Raphelson?

127
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:22,198
Not as well as I wanted to,
if you get my drift.

128
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,472
Hey, she was hot.
What a waste.

129
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,911
Did she have any visitors last week?

130
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,347
Uh, say, Tuesday or Wednesday?
Mm-mmm. No.

131
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,284
Nobody. Nobody.
Not as far as I recall anyway.

132
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,288
Oh, for crying... Now the...
Hector's out!

133
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,291
- Benny, could you go get
your dog, please?
- Why should I?

134
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,293
Because you opened up the garage.

135
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:46,593
<i>Hey, smart guy,</i>
<i>this is a police o</i>ffic<i>er, right?</i>

136
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:50,295
I could have him lock you up.
You think about that.

137
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:54,499
How's it going?
Captain,
this is, uh, Darrell Cain.

138
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:58,237
Darrell Cain,
Captain, uh, Leland Stottlemeyer,
Natalie Teeger, Adrian Monk.

139
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:02,645
- Hi.
- <i>[Disher] Mr. Cain says he was home</i>
<i>last week, but he didn't see</i>...

140
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:06,811
Excuse me. That box
is addressed toJoanne Raphelson.

141
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,821
Yeah.
It was on her porch.

142
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,649
Well, I'd heard she died.
I figured it was up for grabs.

143
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,059
You can't just take mail
from somebody's porch.

144
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,893
Yeah, you can if it's fruit.

145
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,662
The law doesn't apply to fruit
because it's perishable.

146
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,932
Actually, sir,
the law does apply to fruit.

147
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,341
Are you eating one?
No.

148
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:33,071
- I was just putting that back.
- Captain, you wanted
to see her phone records.

149
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,079
Yeah.

150
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,911
No calls at all on Tuesday
or Monday?

151
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:44,787
The last call she made was
Saturday morning at 2:05 a.m.

Hello. This is Captain Leland Stottlemeyer,
San Francisco Police.

Yeah. Hey.
Uh, is this a bad time?

158
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,149
Oh, no, no. Some friends
are throwing me a little party.
It's sort of a tradition.

159
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,621
Well, congratulations
on your flight.

160

Oh, hey, and, uh, congratulations
on that crash landing four years ago.

161
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,787
Oh, and, uh, marrying
a figure skater.

162

Hey.

165
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,562
Monk. I know that name.

166
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:36,574
You're the detective,
the one who quit.

167
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,202
No, l-I didn't quit, uh, exactly.

168
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,678
It was a... It was
a kind of a leave of absence.

169
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,183
It's nothing to be ashamed of, Mr. Monk.
Some people just can't
handle the pressure.

170
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,687
L-l-l-I didn't quit.
Mr. Wagner, I'm sorry.

171
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:53,782
My daughter just wrote
a school paper about you.
Good. I need all the P.R. I can get.

172
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:56,589
She's not gonna believe
that I met you.
Do you mind if I take a picture?

173
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,755
Not at all.
Thank you.

174
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,765
I'm-I'm not a quitter.
I didn't quit.

175
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,529
There were
extenuating circumstances.
There always are.

176
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,629
The trick is not to let them stop us.

177
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:11,807
- Captain, you said it was important.
- Oh, yeah. Um...

178
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,868
Do you know a woman
named Joanne Raphelson?

179
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,608
She's dead, isn't she?

180
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,618
She finally did it.

181
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,819
- You're not surprised.
- [Sighs]

182
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,825
Joanne's been depressed for months.
For years, really.

183
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:31,192
Was about to have a book published,
but somehow that made it worse.

184
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:34,426
Like I was saying to Mr. Monk,
some people just can't
handle the pressure.

185
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,298
It was a psychological discharge,
for God's sake.
It's only temporary.

Intimately.

- When was the last time
you saw her?
- Five years ago.

189

No, wait. Uh, she called you
on the phone last week.
That's true.

190
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,786
She calls me once or twice a year
when she's lonely, depressed or drunk,
and sometimes all three.

we're cutting the cake.

Look, uh, we can talk
about this tomorrow, okay?

193
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,723
That's all right, Captain.
I have no secrets from my wife.

194

Honey, these gentlemen are detectives.
Joanne Raphelson is dead.

Oh, no. Poor girl.
I made a mistake, Captain.

196

Five years ago.
Nicole knows all about it.

Is-Is-Is that an olive?

202
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,923
And an onion and a cherry.

203
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,016
It's my claim to fame.
Would you like one?

204
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:37,426
No, thank you. Mr. Wagner,
I was reading about your flight.

205
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,657
They said they almost
had to cancel the liftoff.

206
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,700
You were running late?
That's true.

207
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,463
I got lost on my way to Edwards.
Can you believe it?

208
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,267
You... You got lost?
I tried a different shortcut.

209
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,867
L-l-I guess I'm a better navigator
in the sky than I am on the highways.

210
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,913
Congressman,
glad you could make it.
Steve!

211
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,440
Hey, when are we gonna have
that talk about your future?
The sooner, the better.

212
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,850
Will you excuse us?
Uh, my friends are waiting.

213
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,855
We can talk about this
some other time?
Absolutely.

214
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,891
Great.
It was nice to meet you.

215
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,449
Nice to meet you.

216
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,518
He's the guy.

217
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,159
Who's the guy?
The astronaut.

218
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,168
He killed her.

219
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:21,297
Somebody made that exact same drink
atJoanne Raphelson's house
before she died.

220
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,274
Monk, it's not possible.
He was in space.

221
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:28,370
He did it.
Outer space, Monk.

222
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,314
He was on TV.
He was orbiting the Earth.

223
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,318
You gotta admit
it's a pretty good alibi.

224
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,958
He... He's the guy.

225
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,231
Monk, 99 times out of a hundred,
I am in your corner.

226
00:12:55,307 --> 00:13:00,745
But I just can't see it.
Steve Wagner is a national hero.
It's true, Mr. Monk.

227
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,839
He was on the cover
of <i>Time</i> magazine.
Actually, it was <i>Newsweek.</i>

228
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,750
Actually, it was both. Now, look,
we need to tread carefully here.

229
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,550
First off, there's no motive.
The wife knew about the affair.

230
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,989
A lot of people did.
But it wasn't just the affair.

231
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:16,027
We just talked toJoanne Raphelson's
editor in New York.

232
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,188
She was about to hand in
her next draft,

233
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,892
which contained a couple
of real bombshells.

234
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:25,266
- Like?
- Like, which of her ex-boyfriends
beat her up five years ago.

235
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,396
Somebody put her in the hospital.

236
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,704
She had a concussion, right?
Mm-hmm.

237
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,801
And you think Steve Wagner's involved?

238
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,971
I just don't believe it.
I'm sorry, Mr. Monk.

239
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,577
Look, Wagner wants
to run for office.

240
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,145
A story like that would bury him.

241
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,681
Okay. Maybe you found a motive.
Maybe.

242
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,160
But it doesn't matter,
and I'll tell you why.

243
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:53,323
Because your suspect, Monk,
was in outer space.

244
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,663
He wasn't on this planet.
It's true.

245
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,726
Julie and I watched it
on television.
The whole world was watching.

246

He took off on Monday,
and he landed on Friday.

247

Here's the case file.
Now, the coroner
is 100% sure.

248
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:11,074
He is certain thatJoanne Raphelson
died of ligature strangulation
on Wednesday morning...

249
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,243
while your man was in space.

250
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:19,356
Now, maybe we should take a minute
and see if we can think
of a better alibi.

251
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:46,379
It's a pretty good alibi.
Yep.

252
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,647
She had drugs in her system?
Barbiturates.

253
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,746
Yeah. Coroner said
she took some pills.

254
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:54,589
They didn't work,
she went to Plan "B" and dangled herself.
It happens all the time.

255
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,458
But you said yourself,
the crime scene didn't look kosher.

256
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:02,660
Yeah, Monk,
what I'm saying is it might be murder,
but it wasn't him.

257
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,930
Captain, I think Monk's right.

258

Thank you!

259
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:11,269
I think I know how Wagner did it.
Okay, this is the ship.

260

And let's pretend this globe
represents the Earth.

261
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,404
That's a globe.
It does represent the Earth.

262
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:20,384
Right. Okay.

263
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:23,910
Here's what happened.

he activates the escape pod.

266
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,560
Well, wait. Uh, wait.

267
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:43,267
Was there an escape pod
on the ship?
No, not officially.

268
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:46,436
But I think he smuggled one on.
Mm-hmm. And where did he get it...
the escape pod?

269
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,946
He built it.

270
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,278
Yeah, out of a kit.
In his basement.

271
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:57,448
He's resourceful.
Anyway, splashdown.

Climbs out of the pod,
makes his way to her house,

climbs back onto the pod,
fires up the engines, back in space.

- It's just a theory.

I don't think so. No.
I've heard theories before,

00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,469
[All]
Be prepared!
That's right.

295
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,632
<i>And that motto saved my life.</i>

296
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,472
<i>Because when the landing gear</i>
<i>didn't come down, I was prepared.</i>

297
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,603
I knew what I had to do.

298
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,616
I went around Florida...
good-bye, Florida...
over Louisiana...

299
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:37,553
<i>and landed the space shuttle here</i>

<i>with a great big belly flop!</i>

00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,716
[Laughing]
And you weren't even scared?

301
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,955
No, I wasn't scared.
I was terrified!

302
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,623
- [Chuckling]
- People called me a hero.

303
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,223
<i>But anybody</i>...
<i>anybody could have done that.</i>

304
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:54,261
You or you or you or you or...

305
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:58,871
you or you.

306
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:03,448
Being brave is being afraid of something,
but doing it anyway.

307
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,918
What are you gonna do next?

308
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:11,820
Tomorrow, I'm testing a brand-new jet
for the air force called the F/ A-22 Raptor.

309
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,824
It's the most advanced fighter
in the world.

310
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,656
<i>She's faster than the speed of sound,</i>

311
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:20,289
so if you hear a big boom
in the sky tomorrow,
that's me saying, "Hello, kids."

312
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:23,459
[Chuckling]
Before I go,

313
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:27,301
I brought some official Steve Wagner
laser pointers for all you kids.

314
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,932
There you go. Take one,
pass them back.

315
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:35,002
Well, I had a great time. And remember,
what does Steve Wagner want you to do?

316
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,311

<i>Thank you so much, Mr. Wagner.</i>
<i>Wasn't he great?</i>
<i>Let's give him a hand.</i>

is Mr. Adrian Monk,

<i>He's going to talk about what it's like</i>

00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,441
I'm, uh...

328
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,836
I'm Adrian Monk.

329
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,010
Who wants to be a detective
when they grow up?

330
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,981
What about you?
No.

331
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,425
No?

332
00:19:56,495 --> 00:20:00,625
Everybody in your row
has their hand up, so...

333
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:07,367
If you put your hand up,
um, it would be a perfect row.

334
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,468
Put your hand up!

335
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:23,577
- Where's your gun?
- Um, I, uh...

336
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:28,092
- I don't... I don't have one.
- You can't carry one
'cause you had a breakdown.

337
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,721
<i>[Chuckling]</i>
Oh, well, uh...

- <i>Julie said you're afraid of milk.</i>
- [Chuckling]

339
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:39,069
Well, everybody's, uh...
everybody's afraid of something, right?

340
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:43,733
- Julie said you're afraid of everything.
- Mr. Monk, l... I really...

341
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,243
<i>Have you ever caught a</i> real <i>killer?</i>

342
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:49,439
Oh, yes. Oh.

343
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,950
Yes, I've caught a lot of killers.

344
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:58,581
Some killers are very smart,
and some are very powerful.

345
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:03,720
Some are even famous.
They don't think
they will ever be caught.

346
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:07,026
But in the end,

347
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,829
they... they are always caught.

348
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,892
And I'll tell you why.

349
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:19,299
Because the police
can make mistakes.

350
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:23,178
I make mistakes all the time.

351
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:26,217
But, uh... But...

352
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,617
[Chuckling]

353
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:36,089
See, a-a killer has to be,
uh... has to...

354
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,961
[Chuckling]

355
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,735
A killer has to be perfect,
and, uh,

356
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,405
nobody's perfect.

357
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,414
The first police officers appeared...

358
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:02,817
in, an... in ancient Rome in 200 B.C.

359
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,823
They were called centurions.

360
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,758
In many ways,
they were like our modern police force.

361
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,261
It was their job to... to...

362
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,890
[Chuckling]
To enforce laws...

363
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:17,560
and to... and to maintain order.

00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,218
Here, Mr. Monk.
Drink that.

369
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:43,193
Are you okay?
Oh.

370
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,661
That was a good, good speech.

371
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,097
I think the kids learned a lot.

372
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,566
Yeah. They're...
They're still laughing.

373
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:53,900
Well, they'll have to stop soon.
Period's almost over.

374
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:57,669
Oh, I am such a...
What do you call it?

375
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:01,770
Wuss. No, Mr. Monk,
you are not a wuss.

376
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,475
Well, I'm not a man.
I know that.

377
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:09,111
I'm a mutant.
I'm half man, half wuss.

I'm a "muss."
Here you are,
our brave centurion.

379
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:14,456
I liked your speech,
especially the little dance number
at the end.

380
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,721
Those laser pointers
can be very dangerous.

381
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,457
Yeah, they're a real menace.
I hear you've been checking up on me...

382
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,022
calling Joanne's family,
her publisher,
turning over rocks.

383
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,093
If you want to talk to me,
let's talk right now,
man to "muss."

384
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,837
Did you hit her?
Hit who?

385
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,813
Joanne. Did you hit her so hard
that she woke up in the hospital?

386
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,975
I wouldn't repeat that, Mr. Monk.
That's slander.

387
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,644
Besides, who would believe it?

388
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,851
But that's why you killed her, isn't it?
Because she was about to go public.

389
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,122
She was about to tell the truth
about you.

390
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:54,654
You're a sad little man.
I can't believe you and I
breathe the same air.

391
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:59,261
I was on a spaceship, Mr. Monk,
circling the Earth with my crew.

392
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:02,033
Why doesn't that satisfy you?

393
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,201
Am I making you nervous?

394
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,713
Never. You know why?

395
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,714
[Snaps Fingers]
See?

396
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,376
You flinched.
See, you're a flincher.

397
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,949
You'll never stop me,
because when the chips are down,

398
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:21,891
when it really counts,
you are always going to flinch.

But how?

00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,944
How did he do it?

You're never going to be
completely free of fear.

The Sears Tower.

446
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:14,724
Mmm. Oh,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

447
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,859
Mmm. No. That...
That's too tall.

448
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,234
Uh, not... not the Sears Tower.

449
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,500
Just a regular Sears, maybe.

450
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:27,676
Just a regular Sears.
Mm-hmm.

451
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:32,410
Department store.
Adrian, why don't we work on
your phobias another time, okay?

452
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:37,444
Okay.

453

[Sighs]

454
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:44,990
When l... When I look at a man...

455
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:48,794
a real man like Steve Wagner...

456
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,001
I just feel weak.

457
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,506
I just feel so inadequate.

458
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:03,139
I know he's guilty,
but I'll never be able to prove it.

459
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:08,982
Adrian, Steve Wagner
is a human being,

460
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:14,014
and if he's guilty, I know something
he's very much afraid of.

461
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:16,356
What's that?

462
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,623
You.

463
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,810
She's in the house.

464
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:44,446
He is up there in space...

465
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,820
circling the Earth.

466
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,825
Maybe he had an accomplice.
No.

467
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,952
We have statements
from all of the neighbors.

468
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,725
There were no visitors, no cars.

469
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:56,699
She was definitely alone.

470
00:28:56,768 --> 00:29:01,671
Somehow, he killed her
from up there.

471
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,073
Well, she collected a lot of dolls.

472
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,236
Lot of really ugly dolls.

473
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,475
Natalie, holes.

474
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,641
How did we miss that?

475
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,743
They were drilled recently.

476
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,586
<i>So? She wasn't killed out there.</i>
<i>She was killed in here.</i>

477
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:24,287
She was <i>found</i> in there,

478
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:27,923
but she could have been killed
someplace else.

479

<i>[Clanging]</i>

480

- Sorry. I didn't know anyone was here.

481
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:44,613
Are you looking for something?

482
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:48,174
I wanted a flower
from her garden.

483
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,244
She loved this garden.

484
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,214
I cared for the girl.
I won't deny that.

485
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:58,160
You came a long way
to pick a flower.
<i>Actually, I was heading up here anyway.</i>

486
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:00,561
I have a test flight at Paxton
in a couple of hours.

487
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,068
Now it's your turn.
What are you doing here?
I'm investigating Joanne's murder.

488
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,296
Her suicide.

489
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,807
It was murder.
I think we both know that.

<i>Are you deaf? Please,</i>

Well, I did, three times!

00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,045
Right! Well, guess what?
It's open again!

493
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,142
<i>Well, maybe it's broke!</i>
<i>It ain't broke!</i>

494
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:25,053
It's brand-new!
Holy son of a... Look at this!

495
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,648
<i>Look at him!</i>
<i>He looks just like</i>...

I think that is.
Who?

497
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,854

He's the... the guy,
the... the spaceman from TV.

498
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:36,526
He's famous!
Go get the camera, would ya?
Stay with your brother!

499
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,331
Go get the camera!
Uh, excuse me.

500
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:42,737
Excuse me.
[Stammering]
Excuse me.

501
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:45,901
Uh, you're...
You're famous, right?

502
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:49,538
You're that, uh, Steve Walenski?
Wagner. Steven Wagner.

503
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,741
Wagner! That's...
I knew that.

504
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:54,011
Wagner!
You're the space cowboy, right?

505
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:58,021
Oh, man!
You're that dude that landed
the space shuttle when it was on fire!

506
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,523
That's correct.
I lost 10 bucks on that.

507
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:03,026
Sorry to disappoint you.
Would you excuse us?

508
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:06,188
We're in the middle of something.
Could you excuse us, please?

509
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,768
You folks live across the street?
Is that right?

510
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:15,237
How... Yeah, that's us.
Right over here.

511
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,536
That's right. How are you, man?
Hey, good to meet you.

512
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,634
I'm... I'm Darrell.
This is my daughter Donna here,

513
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,874
and, well, this is Benny.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

514
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,575
What the hell are you doing here?
Would you...

515
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:30,713
You're curious, aren't you?
That's the best thing a boy can have...
curiosity.

516
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:33,382
I was friends with the lady
that lived here.

517
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,619
Oh, man.
That's a shame.

518
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:38,821
That's... That's heartbreaking.

519
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,196
Could we get a picture?
I can do better than that.

520
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:46,397
I'm flight-testing a brand-new jet
in a couple of hours.
How'd you like to come and watch?

521
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,873
Bring the whole family.
Be my guests.
Are you... you kidding me?

522
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,933
They wouldn't mind?
You have every right to be there.

523
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:57,448
- You're a taxpayer, right?
- Yeah. Sales tax.

524
00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:02,418
Could we come too?
I'm a big aviation buff... fan.

00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,993
Crazy about the, uh...
Can't get enough of'em.

- <i>[Monk] And the wings and all.</i>

529
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,525
<i>[Natalie] And the landing.</i>
<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>What do you call it? The rudder.</i>

530
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,767

00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,777
The most advanced warplanes
ever built.

534
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:32,839
Some of these planes are prototypes.
That means nobody's ever flown 'em.

535
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,613
<i>[Darrell] It sounds dangerous.</i>
<i>[Wagner]</i>
<i>It can be dangerous.</i>

536
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:39,020
Then why do you do it?
If I didn't do it, Benny,
somebody else would.

537
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,058
And where's the fun in that?

538
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,788
Now, you kids will love this.
This is a flight simulator.

539
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,626
It's kind of like
a 30-million-dollar video game.
Cool!

540
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,690
Want to check it out?
Okay.

541
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:52,327
You grown-ups stay here.
We'll be right back.

Hey, how well you know him?

00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:07,012
Well enough to wonder
what he's doing.
Let's go in.

Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Maybe we installed it wrong.

550

[Scoffs]

That's it! Natalie,
it's all about the doll!

560
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:56,866

Come on.
You stole it, didn't you?

564
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,941
It was in a box
sitting on Joanne's front porch,

565
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:14,814
and you took it, just like you took
the Fruit of the Month box.

566
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,979
It was sitting there
for three days, all right?

00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,489

<i>Huh?</i>

This is Captain Savo.
I just lost two of my civilians.
Notify the law enforcement desk.

00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,909
Okay, thank you.
Captain's on his way.

<i>Wagner must have</i>
<i>gone toJoanne's house.</i>

579
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,658
<i>He drugged her,</i>
<i>but not enough to kill her.</i>

580
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:58,695
<i>Just enough to knock her out</i>
<i>for a couple of days.</i>

581
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,358
Then he built a machine...
a murder machine...

582
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:06,028
<i>a machine that would hang her on Wednesday,</i>
<i>long after he was gone.</i>

583
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,972
What kind of machine?
A garage door opener.

584
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,509
<i>He left her there drugged,</i>
<i>probably tied up,</i>

585
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:16,377
<i>and then took o</i>ff <i>into space</i>
<i>with the whole world watching.</i>

00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:23,583
Mr. Monk,
what are you doing?

587
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,588
I don't know.

588
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,056
<i>They're at Ramp Two.</i>
<i>He's handling the missile.</i>

589
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,060
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Those are missiles!

590
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,426
Th-Th-They could be nuclear weapons!

591
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,624
Then stop me,

She died on Wednesday.
How did he activate the machine?

594
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:49,571
It was so simple,
it was brilliant.
He used a remote control.

595
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,810
<i>He taped it or glued it down</i>
<i>so it stayed on.</i>

596
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:56,718
<i>Then he put the remote control</i>
<i>inside one of those dolls.</i>

597
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:59,881
<i>Then he mailed it to her own house</i>
<i>second-day mail.</i>

598
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:02,050
<i>Second-day mail.</i>
<i>Wednesday morning!</i>

599
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,060
Exactly.
It was like a time bomb.

600
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:08,064
- <i>The mailman delivered the remote control,</i>
<i>put it on the front porch.</i>
- <i>[Beeps]</i>

601
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:11,898
<i>On the other side of that door,</i>

602
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:16,668
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>But they found her in the living room.</i>

603
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:19,107
After he landed,
Wagner went back to her house.

604
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,941
He dismantled the machine
and moved her body
into the other room.

605
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,277
It was a perfect plan,
except for one thing.

606
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,578
<i>The doll was missing!</i>

607
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:30,747
<i>He must have panicked.</i>
<i>He went back there again</i>

608
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:33,881
<i>He knows that remote</i>
<i>can tie him to the murder.</i>

609
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:37,519
His fingerprints are all over it.
Excuse me. Hi.

610
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:40,257
Hey, nice ride.
Hi. Listen, we're looking
for Steve Wagner.

611
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:43,425
He may be on the flight line.
I think they just cleared him
for takeoff.

612
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,731
Great. We'd love to watch.
Which way?

613
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:49,739
You can't miss him.
He's in a brand-new F/ A-22.

614
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:54,767
Oh. Uh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Hi. Hi. Hello again.

615
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:58,440
Could you settle a bet?
My friend and I were wondering if, uh,

616
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:03,180
somebody could drop anything
out of the cockpit of an F/ A-22?

617
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,950
Of course, uh, I say no way.
Of course you can!

618
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:09,754
Like what?
Uh, you know, a Japanese doll.

619
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:14,059
- About this big.
- Well, there's an air lock,
like a chute,

620
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,065
to drop flares
and emergency transmitters.

621
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:18,294
I owe you one. Go figure.
Thank you!

Well, all my friends at school

Well, um, anyways,
