1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:04,002
The countdown is under way here
at Edwards Air Force Base.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,734
The new experimental rocket plane,
which was developed
by Altman Aerodynamics,

3
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:13,040
<i>is scheduled to launch tomorrow morning</i>
<i>at 7:30 Pacific Time.</i>

4
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:16,048
The four-man crew will be led
by a familiar face,

5
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:19,381
astronaut and civilian test pilot,
Steven Wagner.

6
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:22,114
<i>Wagner became a national hero</i>
<i>four years ago,</i>

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:26,147
<i>when he made</i>
<i>a courageous emergency landing</i>
<i>in the space shuttle during reentry.</i>

8
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:29,423
A national hero
in my very own living room.

9
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,465
- But I'll never be a hero to you, will I?
- You were once.

10
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,600
<i>Is this it?</i>
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

11
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:39,866
<i>Between the Sheets:</i>
<i>The Joanne Raphelson Story.</i>

12
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:43,375
You wanna read it?
You're Chapter Five.
How many chapters are there?

13
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:46,276
Fifteen.
Wow.
You've been a busy girl, Joanne.

14
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:49,679
And that's only Volume One.

15
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,774
You really went into detail?

16
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:54,411
My editor insisted on it.
The juicier, the better.

17
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:58,423
<i>That's why I called you, Steve.</i>
<i>I didn't want you to be surprised.</i>

18
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,982
I appreciate that, Joanne.

19
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,600
I really do.

20
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:12,764
So, has anyone seen this
new version yet?
Not yet.

21
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:16,468
When do you hand it in?
Next week.
I'm still proofreading it.

22
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,011
Cheers.

23
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,741
Oh.

24
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,340
An olive, a cherry and an onion?
What do you call this?

25
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,544
A Spacewalk.
It's my own recipe.

26
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:29,383
It's a good name.
I feel like I'm flying.

27
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,515
Oh.

28
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,118
So, do you wanna read it?
I plan to.
That's why I'm here.

29
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,164
But... I've changed my mind.
Oh.

30
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,529
Hell, I've been a test pilot
for 15 years.

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,194
I once landed a space shuttle
in the ocean.

32
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,965
I think I can handle
whatever's in Chapter Five.

33
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,132
So hand it in.
Hit me with your best shot.

34
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,438
Thank you, Steve.

35
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,344
Mmm.

36
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:58,441
<i>Sir, there's a rumor you might</i>
<i>be considering a run for Senate.</i>

37
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:01,282
- I don't know.
I've been to Washington.
- Look at you.

38
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:04,812
- I think I'm a lot safer in outer space.
- Damn, you're cute.

39
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,655
<i>After this mission,</i>
<i>I'm going to sit down</i>
<i>and review my options.</i>

40
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:12,755
<i>But I will say this: If I choose</i>
<i>to run for public office,</i>
<i>I'll treat it like any other mission.</i>

41
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,993
I will fully commit,
and I will win.

42
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,332
Failure is not an option.

43
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,901
Hello?
Miss Raphelson?

44
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,601
Miss Raphelson, I see your car.

45
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,073
Miss Raphelson?

46
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:38,208
Miss Raphelson!

47
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,113
Career Day.

48
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:48,126
What would I talk about?
Your career.

49
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,128
Your job.
Yeah.

50
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:52,187
Come on, Mr. Monk.
It would mean so much to Julie.

51
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,199
Yeah. I-I can't do it.
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,236
I-I can't speak in public.
See, that's not true.

53
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:01,467
Remember when I first started working
for you, and you made that list
of all your fears and phobias?

54
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,942
There were 103 things.
Public speaking wasn't one of them.

55
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,104
There were a couple of things
that I didn't mention.

56
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,308
I didn't want you to think I was weird.
Why don't you ask the captain?

57
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:14,251
Oh-
Whatever it is, thank you for asking,
but I can't do it.

58
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,460
The housekeeper has her own key.
She comes in every other week.

59
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,688
She found the body right here
couple hours ago.

60
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:27,130
Her name is, uh,
Joanne Raphelson, 36.

61
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,294
Former Vegas showgirl.
The coroner just took the body.

62
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,897
Said she's been dead for five days.
So that makes it, uh-

63
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:37,602
Two days-
Wednesday morning.
Wednesday?

64
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,737
Excuse me.
Why are we here?
She killed herself, right?

65
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,714
<i>Uh, maybe.</i>
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

66
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,946
I noticed a few things.
I wanted to run 'em by you.

67
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,321
<i>I found a letter from</i>
<i>a publisher in New York.</i>

68
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,123
She was about
to have a book published.

69
00:04:56,195 --> 00:05:00,859
A memoir called
<i>Between the Sheets:</i>
<i>The Joanne Raphelson Story.</i>

70
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,867
<i>"Between the-"</i>

71
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:06,632
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I get it. I got it.

72
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:10,574
And a check for 50 grand,
which she has not deposited.

73
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,634
Pretty weird time
to hang yourself, huh?

74
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:17,046
Good work, sir.
You don't have to sound
so surprised, Randy.

75
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:20,984
Oh. I'm not surprised.
I'm awestruck.

76
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:26,419
Awestruck.
Well, don't be.
And that's an order.

77
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:30,053
You're ordering me not to be awestruck?
That's right. Stand over there,
and don't be awestruck.

78
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,063
Yes, sir.

79
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:39,098
Anything else?
Uh, yeah.
Looks like her computer's missing.

80
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:43,199
There's a power strip
with a surge protector,
a printer and no computer.

81
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,506
Excuse me, sir.

82
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:49,446
Sorry. I've never disobeyed
an order in my life.

83
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,449
It's really good work.
It's awesome.

84
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,008
Randy, why don't you go outside
and talk to the neighbors?

85
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:57,614
Yes, sir.
It's awesome.

86
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:03,695
So, am I right?
Something's not kosher.

87
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,037
It's her driver's license.

88
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,039
How tall you think that stool is?

89
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:19,405
Mmm, about 18 inches?

90
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,747
The rope's 7'6".

91
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:28,310
But according to her license,
she's only 5'5".

92
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,380
I'm 5'5".

93
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,391
Step up.

94
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,721
You're right.

95
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,134
It doesn't add up.

96
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,532
So, how long have you lived here?
Fifteen years.

97
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,871
Maybe 14.
You know what?
My old lady'd know that.

98
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:53,343
You can ask her when she gets back.
If she's sober.

99
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,041
Mmm. Hey, you want
one of these? Nectarines?

100
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,515
They're the perfect fruit.
There you go.
Oh. Okay.

101
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:03,119
Now, why is the garage door
open again?

102
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,124
- Benny, what did I tell you about this?
- I didn't open it.

103
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,752
- Really? Well, then, who did?
- Maybe Donna did it.

104
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,592
You ever think of that?
Your sister couldn't open up
a box of crayons.

105
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,928
She's six years old,
for cryin' out loud.

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,594
Mr. Cain, I just have
a few more questions.

107
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,603
How well did you know
Miss Raphelson?

108
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:22,198
Not as well as I wanted to,
if you get my drift.

109
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,472
Hey, she was hot.
What a waste.

110
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,911
Did she have any visitors last week?

111
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,347
Uh, say, Tuesday or Wednesday?
Mm-mmm. No.

112
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,284
Nobody. Nobody.
Not as far as I recall anyway.

113
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,288
Oh, for crying- Now the-
Hector's out!

114
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,291
- Benny, could you go get
your dog, please?
- Why should I?

115
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,293
Because you opened up the garage.

116
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:46,593
<i>Hey, smart guy,</i>
<i>this is a police officer, right?</i>

117
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:50,295
I could have him lock you up.
You think about that.

118
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:54,499
How's it going?
Captain,
this is, uh, Darrell Cain.

119
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:58,237
Darrell Cain,
Captain, uh, Leland Stottlemeyer,
Natalie Teeger, Adrian Monk.

120
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:02,645
- Hi.
- <i>Mr. Cain says he was home</i>
<i>last week, but he didn't see-</i>

121
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:06,811
Excuse me. That box
is addressed to Joanne Raphelson.

122
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,821
Yeah.
It was on her porch.

123
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,649
Well, I'd heard she died.
I figured it was up for grabs.

124
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,059
You can't just take mail
from somebody's porch.

125
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,893
Yeah, you can if it's fruit.

126
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,662
The law doesn't apply to fruit
because it's perishable.

127
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,932
Actually, sir,
the law does apply to fruit.

128
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,341
Are you eating one?
No.

129
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:33,071
- I was just putting that back.
- Captain, you wanted
to see her phone records.

130
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,079
Yeah.

131
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,911
No calls at all on Tuesday
or Monday?

132
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:44,787
The last call she made was
Saturday morning at 2:05 a.m.

133
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:53,532
Hello. This is Captain Leland Stottlemeyer,
San Francisco Police.

134
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,590
Who's this?

135
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,871
<i>Captain Stottlemeyer?</i>

136
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,815
Yeah. Hey.
Uh, is this a bad time?

137
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,149
Oh, no, no. Some friends
are throwing me a little party.
It's sort of a tradition.

138
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,621
Well, congratulations
on your flight.

139
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,126
Oh, hey, and, uh, congratulations
on that crash landing four years ago.

140
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,787
Oh, and, uh, marrying
a figure skater.

141
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,956
Yeah. Congratulations
on your whole damn life.

142
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,057
Uh, this is Lieutenant Disher,

143
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,398
Natalie Teeger
and Adrian Monk.
Hey.

144
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,562
Monk. I know that name.

145
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:36,574
You're the detective,
the one who quit.

146
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,202
No, I-I didn't quit, uh, exactly.

147
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,678
It was a- It was
a kind of a leave of absence.

148
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,183
It's nothing to be ashamed of, Mr. Monk.
Some people just can't
handle the pressure.

149
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,687
I-I-I-I didn't quit.
Mr. Wagner, I'm sorry.

150
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:53,782
My daughter just wrote
a school paper about you.
Good. I need all the P.R. I can get.

151
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:56,589
She's not gonna believe
that I met you.
Do you mind if I take a picture?

152
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,755
Not at all.
Thank you.

153
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,765
I'm-I'm not a quitter.
I didn't quit.

154
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,529
There were
extenuating circumstances.
There always are.

155
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,629
The trick is not to let them stop us.

156
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:11,807
- Captain, you said it was important.
- Oh, yeah. Um-

157
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,868
Do you know a woman
named Joanne Raphelson?

158
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,608
She's dead, isn't she?

159
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,618
She finally did it.

160
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,819
You're not surprised.

161
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,825
Joanne's been depressed for months.
For years, really.

162
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:31,192
Was about to have a book published,
but somehow that made it worse.

163
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:34,426
Like I was saying to Mr. Monk,
some people just can't
handle the pressure.

164
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,298
It was a psychological discharge,
for God's sake.
It's only temporary.

165
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,304
I plan on being reinstated.
He's so much better.

166
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:43,308
How well did you know her?
Intimately.

167
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,971
- When was the last time
you saw her?
- Five years ago.

168
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:51,380
No, wait. Uh, she called you
on the phone last week.
That's true.

169
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,786
She calls me once or twice a year
when she's lonely, depressed or drunk,
and sometimes all three.

170
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,324
Steven? Honey,
we're cutting the cake.

171
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,452
Look, uh, we can talk
about this tomorrow, okay?

172
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,723
That's all right, Captain.
I have no secrets from my wife.

173
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:09,564
Honey, these gentlemen are detectives.
Joanne Raphelson is dead.

174
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:13,537
Oh, no. Poor girl.
I made a mistake, Captain.

175
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:17,167
Five years ago.
Nicole knows all about it.

176
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,371
I don't deserve this woman.

177
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,074
Excuse me, ma'am.
What is that you're drinking?

178
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,583
It's called a Spacewalk.

179
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,619
My husband invented it.

180
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,917
Is-Is-Is that an olive?

181
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,923
And an onion and a cherry.

182
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,016
It's my claim to fame.
Would you like one?

183
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:37,426
No, thank you. Mr. Wagner,
I was reading about your flight.

184
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,657
They said they almost
had to cancel the liftoff.

185
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,700
You were running late?
That's true.

186
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,463
I got lost on my way to Edwards.
Can you believe it?

187
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,267
You-You got lost?
I tried a different shortcut.

188
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,867
I-I-I guess I'm a better navigator
in the sky than I am on the highways.

189
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,913
Congressman,
glad you could make it.
Steve!

190
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,440
Hey, when are we gonna have
that talk about your future?
The sooner, the better.

191
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,850
Will you excuse us?
Uh, my friends are waiting.

192
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,855
We can talk about this
some other time?
Absolutely.

193
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,891
Great.
It was nice to meet you.

194
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,449
Nice to meet you.

195
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,518
He's the guy.

196
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,159
Who's the guy?
The astronaut.

197
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,168
He killed her.

198
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:21,297
Somebody made that exact same drink
at Joanne Raphelson's house
before she died.

199
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,274
Monk, it's not possible.
He was in space.

200
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:28,370
He did it.
Outer space, Monk.

201
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,314
He was on TV.
He was orbiting the Earth.

202
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,318
You gotta admit
it's a pretty good alibi.

203
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,958
He- He's the guy.

204
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,231
Monk, 99 times out of a hundred,
I am in your corner.

205
00:12:55,307 --> 00:13:00,745
But I just can't see it.
Steve Wagner is a national hero.
It's true, Mr. Monk.

206
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,839
He was on the cover
of <i>Time</i> magazine.
Actually, it was <i>Newsweek</i>.

207
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,750
Actually, it was both. Now, look,
we need to tread carefully here.

208
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,550
First off, there's no motive.
The wife knew about the affair.

209
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,989
A lot of people did.
But it wasn't just the affair.

210
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:16,027
We just talked to Joanne Raphelson's
editor in New York.

211
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,188
She was about to hand in
her next draft,

212
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,892
which contained a couple
of real bombshells.

213
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:25,266
- Like?
- Like, which of her ex-boyfriends
beat her up five years ago.

214
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,396
Somebody put her in the hospital.

215
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,704
She had a concussion, right?
Mm-hmm.

216
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,801
And you think Steve Wagner's involved?

217
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,971
I just don't believe it.
I'm sorry, Mr. Monk.

218
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,577
Look, Wagner wants
to run for office.

219
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,145
A story like that would bury him.

220
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,681
Okay. Maybe you found a motive.
Maybe.

221
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,160
But it doesn't matter,
and I'll tell you why.

222
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:53,323
Because your suspect, Monk,
was in outer space.

223
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,663
He wasn't on this planet.
It's true.

224
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,726
Julie and I watched it
on television.
The whole world was watching.

225
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,500
He took off on Monday,
and he landed on Friday.

226
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:06,443
Here's the case file.
Now, the coroner
is 100% sure.

227
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:11,074
He is certain that Joanne Raphelson
died of ligature strangulation
on Wednesday morning...

228
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,243
while your man was in space.

229
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:19,356
Now, maybe we should take a minute
and see if we can think
of a better alibi.

230
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:46,379
It's a pretty good alibi.
Yep.

231
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,647
She had drugs in her system?
Barbiturates.

232
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,746
Yeah. Coroner said
she took some pills.

233
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:54,589
They didn't work,
she went to Plan "B" and dangled herself.
It happens all the time.

234
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,458
But you said yourself,
the crime scene didn't look kosher.

235
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:02,660
Yeah, Monk,
what I'm saying is it might be murder,
but it wasn't him.

236
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,930
Captain, I think Monk's right.

237
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,063
Thank you!
Reinforcements.

238
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:11,269
I think I know how Wagner did it.
Okay, this is the ship.

239
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,334
And let's pretend this globe
represents the Earth.

240
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,404
That's a globe.
It does represent the Earth.

241
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:20,384
Right. Okay.

242
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:23,910
Here's what happened.
The first part was easy.
He takes off.

243
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:36,994
As he passes over San Francisco,
he activates the escape pod.

244
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,560
Well, wait. Uh, wait.

245
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:43,267
Was there an escape pod
on the ship?
No, not officially.

246
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:46,436
But I think he smuggled one on.
Mm-hmm. And where did he get it-
the escape pod?

247
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,946
He built it.

248
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,278
Yeah, out of a kit.
In his basement.

249
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:57,448
He's resourceful.
Anyway, splashdown.

250
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,889
Climbs out of the pod,
makes his way to her house,

251
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:05,295
kills her,
climbs back onto the pod,
fires up the engines, back in space.

252
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:09,232
- Thank you, Randy. That's-
- It's just a theory.

253
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,930
I don't think so. No.
I've heard theories before,

254
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,974
and, uh,
they don't sound like that.

255
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,537
It's him.
It's Steve Wagner.

256
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,778
Hello? Yes.

257
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:33,385
Really? Oh, that's wonderful!

258
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:37,862
<i>Uh, tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m.</i>

259
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,091
Oh, the kids are gonna
be so thrilled.

260
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,565
Okay, great.
I'll see you then.

261
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:46,365
Steve Wagner is speaking
at Julie's school for Career Day.

262
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:50,738
Wait. You invited him?
Yeah, I met his P.R. person
last night as we were leaving.

263
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,972
Natalie, he killed his ex-girlfriend!

264
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,537
Monk, maybe you should go too.

265
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:00,016
You think the guy's involved?
It'll give you a chance to feel him out.

266
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,018
Fine. Okay.
I'll do it.

267
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,654
You're both coming?

268
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,162
I'm gonna be class mom of the year!

269
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:16,032
When I was your age,
I was a Boy Scout.

270
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,035
Who here knows the Boy Scout motto?

271
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,469
Be prepared!
That's right.

272
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,632
<i>And that motto saved my life.</i>

273
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,472
<i>Because when the landing gear</i>
<i>didn't come down, I was prepared.</i>

274
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,603
I knew what I had to do.

275
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,616
I went around Florida-
good-bye, Florida-
over Louisiana...

276
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:37,553
<i>and landed the space shuttle here</i>
<i>in the Gulf of Mexico</i>
<i>with a great big belly flop!</i>

277
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,716
And you weren't even scared?

278
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,955
No, I wasn't scared.
I was terrified!

279
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,623
People called me a hero.

280
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,223
<i>But anybody-</i>
<i>anybody could have done that.</i>

281
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:54,261
You or you or you or you or...

282
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:58,871
you or you.

283
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:03,448
Being brave is being afraid of something,
but doing it anyway.

284
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,918
What are you gonna do next?

285
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:11,820
Tomorrow, I'm testing a brand-new jet
for the air force called the F/A-22 Raptor.

286
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,824
It's the most advanced fighter
in the world.

287
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,656
<i>She's faster than the speed of sound,</i>

288
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:20,289
so if you hear a big boom
in the sky tomorrow,
that's me saying, "Hello, kids."

289
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:23,459
Before I go,

290
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:27,301
I brought some official Steve Wagner
laser pointers for all you kids.

291
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,932
There you go. Take one,
pass them back.

292
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:35,002
Well, I had a great time. And remember,
what does Steve Wagner want you to do?

293
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,311
Aim high!
Right there.

294
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:43,944
<i>Thank you so much, Mr. Wagner.</i>
<i>Wasn't he great?</i>
<i>Let's give him a hand.</i>

295
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:49,289
Thank you. Okay,
so Julie's next guest
is Mr. Adrian Monk,

296
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,659
who's also my boss,
so everybody be extra nice.

297
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,666
<i>He's going to talk about what it's like</i>
<i>to be a police detective.</i>

298
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,363
Hi.

299
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:11,213
Hi. I'm- I'm, uh-

300
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,985
I'm-

301
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,699
Leave it.

302
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,441
I'm, uh-

303
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,836
I'm Adrian Monk.

304
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,010
Who wants to be a detective
when they grow up?

305
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,981
What about you?
No.

306
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,425
No?

307
00:19:56,495 --> 00:20:00,625
Everybody in your row
has their hand up, so-

308
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:07,367
If you put your hand up,
um, it would be a perfect row.

309
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,468
Put your hand up!

310
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:23,577
- Where's your gun?
- Um, I, uh-

311
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:28,092
- I don't- I don't have one.
- You can't carry one
'cause you had a breakdown.

312
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,721
Oh, well, uh-

313
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:35,062
<i>Julie said you're afraid of milk.</i>

314
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:39,069
Well, everybody's, uh-
everybody's afraid of something, right?

315
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:43,733
- Julie said you're afraid of everything.
- Mr. Monk, I- I really-

316
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,243
<i>Have you ever caught a</i> real <i>killer?</i>

317
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:49,439
Oh, yes. Oh.

318
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,950
Yes, I've caught a lot of killers.

319
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:58,581
Some killers are very smart,
and some are very powerful.

320
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:03,720
Some are even famous.
They don't think
they will ever be caught.

321
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:07,026
But in the end,

322
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,829
they- they are always caught.

323
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,892
And I'll tell you why.

324
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:19,299
Because the police
can make mistakes.

325
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:23,178
I make mistakes all the time.

326
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:26,217
But, uh- But-

327
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:36,089
See, a-a killer has to be,
uh- has to-

328
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,735
A killer has to be perfect,
and, uh,

329
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,405
nobody's perfect.

330
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,414
The first police officers appeared...

331
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:02,817
in, an- in ancient Rome in 200 B.C.

332
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,823
They were called centurions.

333
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,758
In many ways,
they were like our modern police force.

334
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,261
It was their job to- to-

335
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,890
to enforce laws...

336
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:17,560
and to- and to maintain order.

337
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:21,197
Uh, they were, uh,
chosen for their-

338
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:27,142
for their loyalty and courage!

339
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,218
Here, Mr. Monk.
Drink that.

340
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:43,193
Are you okay?
Oh.

341
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,661
That was a good, good speech.

342
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,097
I think the kids learned a lot.

343
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,566
Yeah. They're-
They're still laughing.

344
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:53,900
Well, they'll have to stop soon.
Period's almost over.

345
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:57,669
Oh, I am such a-
What do you call it?

346
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:01,770
Wuss. No, Mr. Monk,
you are not a wuss.

347
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,475
Well, I'm not a man.
I know that.

348
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:09,111
I'm a mutant.
I'm half man, half wuss.

349
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,553
I'm a "muss."
Here you are,
our brave centurion.

350
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:14,456
I liked your speech,
especially the little dance number
at the end.

351
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,721
Those laser pointers
can be very dangerous.

352
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,457
Yeah, they're a real menace.
I hear you've been checking up on me-

353
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,022
calling Joanne's family,
her publisher,
turning over rocks.

354
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,093
If you want to talk to me,
let's talk right now,
man to "muss."

355
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,837
Did you hit her?
Hit who?

356
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,813
Joanne. Did you hit her so hard
that she woke up in the hospital?

357
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,975
I wouldn't repeat that, Mr. Monk.
That's slander.

358
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,644
Besides, who would believe it?

359
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,851
But that's why you killed her, isn't it?
Because she was about to go public.

360
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,122
She was about to tell the truth
about you.

361
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:54,654
You're a sad little man.
I can't believe you and I
breathe the same air.

362
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:59,261
I was on a spaceship, Mr. Monk,
circling the Earth with my crew.

363
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:02,033
Why doesn't that satisfy you?

364
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,201
Am I making you nervous?

365
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,713
Never. You know why?

366
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,714
See?

367
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,376
You flinched.
See, you're a flincher.

368
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,949
You'll never stop me,
because when the chips are down,

369
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:21,891
when it really counts,
you are always going to flinch.

370
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,997
Sir, sorry to interrupt.
We have to go.

371
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:30,034
Would you excuse us?
The governor's waiting.

372
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:38,439
Oh, my God.
You were right.

373
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:43,573
He killed her.
That was almost a confession.

374
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,741
But how?

375
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,944
How did he do it?

376
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:56,653
I mean, they were just toys-
little red flashlights-

377
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:59,458
but I was terrified.

378
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,729
I wanted to scream.

379
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:06,100
What-What did you do?

380
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,162
I screamed.

381
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,866
Least, I heard screaming.

382
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,934
I'm pretty sure it was me.

383
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,879
Adrian, you were giving a speech
in front of a group of people.

384
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:20,907
That's real progress.
No, really, I'm very proud of you.

385
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,284
Yeah.

386
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,017
You're never going to be
completely free of fear.

387
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:31,085
You can't expect that.
But real courage is being afraid
of something and doing it anyway.

388
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,756
No.
What?

389
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:37,893
Steve Wagner said
the exact same thing.

390
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:42,899
Really?
The-The astronaut.

391
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,877
Doctor-
Killed his girlfriend.

392
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:51,074
Wh-Wh-Which I do not condone.
It's indefensible, of course.

393
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:56,645
See, now I'm afraid all the time.

394
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:00,919
I'm so tired of being afraid.

395
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,483
Adrian, I'm anxious to talk
about your phobias.

396
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,827
We talked about aversion therapy.

397
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:10,265
Okay. Let's- Let's- Let's do it.
Let's do it right now.

398
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,667
Okay, okay, all right.
Here we go.

399
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,638
Which of your fears
would you like to work on first?

400
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:20,236
Glaciers.
Glaciers.

401
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,145
No. Rodeos.

402
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,148
Ah, glaciers.
Glaciers.

403
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:29,778
W-W-Wait.
Why don't we just start
with a basic one- fear of heights?

404
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,947
Ah, okay. Heights.
Heights.

405
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,753
Let's do it.
Okay, good.
Let's get up on the roof right now.

406
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:38,125
Okay, wait, wait.
All right. Wait. Sit.
I'll sit.

407
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:42,530
Sit down.
Okay, I'm down.
I'm sitting down.

408
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:47,868
I'm not- I'm not ready...
for that.

409
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,204
Uh, let's-

410
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:54,609
Let's just build up to it gradually.

411
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,275
Here's what-
Why don't we sit here...

412
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:04,345
and, uh, name really tall things?

413
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,413
I'll go first.

414
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,950
The Sears Tower.

415
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:14,724
Mmm. Oh,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

416
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,859
Mmm. No. That-
That's too tall.

417
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,234
Uh, not- not the Sears Tower.

418
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,500
Just a regular Sears, maybe.

419
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:27,676
Just a regular Sears.
Mm-hmm.

420
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:32,410
Department store.
Adrian, why don't we work on
your phobias another time, okay?

421
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:37,444
Okay.

422
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:44,990
When I-When I look at a man-

423
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:48,794
a real man like Steve Wagner-

424
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,001
I just feel weak.

425
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,506
I just feel so inadequate.

426
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:03,139
I know he's guilty,
but I'll never be able to prove it.

427
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:08,982
Adrian, Steve Wagner
is a human being,

428
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:14,014
and if he's guilty, I know something
he's very much afraid of.

429
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:16,356
What's that?

430
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,623
You.

431
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,810
She's in the house.

432
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:44,446
He is up there in space...

433
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,820
circling the Earth.

434
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,825
Maybe he had an accomplice.
No.

435
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,952
We have statements
from all of the neighbors.

436
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,725
There were no visitors, no cars.

437
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:56,699
She was definitely alone.

438
00:28:56,768 --> 00:29:01,671
Somehow, he killed her
from up there.

439
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,073
Well, she collected a lot of dolls.

440
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,236
Lot of really ugly dolls.

441
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,475
Natalie, holes.

442
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,641
How did we miss that?

443
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,743
They were drilled recently.

444
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,586
<i>So? She wasn't killed out there.</i>
<i>She was killed in here.</i>

445
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:24,287
She was <i>found</i> in there,

446
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:27,923
but she could have been killed
someplace else.

447
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:41,675
- Speak of the devil.
- Sorry. I didn't know anyone was here.

448
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:44,613
Are you looking for something?

449
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:48,174
I wanted a flower
from her garden.

450
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,244
She loved this garden.

451
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,214
I cared for the girl.
I won't deny that.

452
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:58,160
You came a long way
to pick a flower.
<i>Actually, I was heading up here anyway.</i>

453
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:00,561
I have a test flight at Paxton
in a couple of hours.

454
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,068
Now it's your turn.
What are you doing here?
I'm investigating Joanne's murder.

455
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,296
Her suicide.

456
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,807
It was murder.
I think we both know that.

457
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:14,675
<i>Come on, man!</i>
<i>Are you deaf? Please,</i>
<i>just close the damn garage door!</i>

458
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,737
Well, I did, three times!

459
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,045
Right! Well, guess what?
It's open again!

460
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,142
<i>Well, maybe it's broke!</i>
<i>It ain't broke!</i>

461
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:25,053
It's brand-new!
Holy son of a- Look at this!

462
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,648
<i>Look at him!</i>
<i>He looks just like-</i>

463
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,716
Hey, you know what?
I think that is.
Who?

464
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,854
The-Who? The-
He's the- the guy,
the- the spaceman from TV.

465
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:36,526
He's famous!
Go get the camera, would ya?
Stay with your brother!

466
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,331
Go get the camera!
Uh, excuse me.

467
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:42,737
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

468
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:45,901
Uh, you're-
You're famous, right?

469
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:49,538
You're that, uh, Steve Walenski?
Wagner. Steven Wagner.

470
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,741
Wagner! That's-
I knew that.

471
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:54,011
Wagner!
You're the space cowboy, right?

472
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:58,021
Oh, man!
You're that dude that landed
the space shuttle when it was on fire!

473
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,523
That's correct.
I lost 10 bucks on that.

474
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:03,026
Sorry to disappoint you.
Would you excuse us?

475
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:06,188
We're in the middle of something.
Could you excuse us, please?

476
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,768
You folks live across the street?
Is that right?

477
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:15,237
How-Yeah, that's us.
Right over here.

478
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,536
That's right. How are you, man?
Hey, good to meet you.

479
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,634
I'm- I'm Darrell.
This is my daughter Donna here,

480
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,874
and, well, this is Benny.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

481
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,575
What the hell are you doing here?
Would you-

482
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:30,713
You're curious, aren't you?
That's the best thing a boy can have-
curiosity.

483
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:33,382
I was friends with the lady
that lived here.

484
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,619
Oh, man.
That's a shame.

485
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:38,821
That's-That's heartbreaking.

486
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,196
Could we get a picture?
I can do better than that.

487
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:46,397
I'm flight-testing a brand-new jet
in a couple of hours.
How'd you like to come and watch?

488
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,873
Bring the whole family.
Be my guests.
Are you-you kidding me?

489
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,933
They wouldn't mind?
You have every right to be there.

490
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:57,448
- You're a taxpayer, right?
- Yeah. Sales tax.

491
00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:02,418
Could we come too?
I'm a big aviation buff- fan.

492
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,921
<i>So true.</i>
<i>Fan- Fan or buff.</i>

493
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,957
Such a fanatic. Just-
I love airplanes.

494
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,993
Crazy about the, uh-
Can't get enough of 'em.

495
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,257
- The-The takeoff.
- <i>And the wings and all.</i>

496
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,525
<i>And the landing.</i>
<i>What do you call it? The rudder.</i>

497
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,767
You wouldn't mind if we come,
do you?

498
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,299
<i>We're talking about</i>
<i>state-of-the-art technology here.</i>

499
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,777
The most advanced warplanes
ever built.

500
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:32,839
Some of these planes are prototypes.
That means nobody's ever flown 'em.

501
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,613
<i>It sounds dangerous.</i>
<i>It can be dangerous.</i>

502
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:39,020
Then why do you do it?
If I didn't do it, Benny,
somebody else would.

503
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,058
And where's the fun in that?

504
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,788
Now, you kids will love this.
This is a flight simulator.

505
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,626
It's kind of like
a 30-million-dollar video game.
Cool!

506
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,690
Want to check it out?
Okay.

507
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:52,327
You grown-ups stay here.
We'll be right back.

508
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,598
Captain Savo, you're in charge.

509
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:01,675
He is good people.
Yeah, he's good people.

510
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,714
Hey, how well you know him?

511
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:07,012
Well enough to wonder
what he's doing.
Let's go in.

512
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:12,485
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's a little dark in there.
No, just-

513
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,889
Let's just wait out here
for a while.

514
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:20,025
<i>Paulie, why is this garage door open?</i>

515
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,931
Don't know, Sarge.
Opened by itself.
Maybe we installed it wrong.

516
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,333
I got the same problem
with my garage.

517
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,337
It's like an epidemic.

518
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:32,673
Natalie, I know how he did it.

519
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:36,441
I know how he killed her!
It's all about the garage doors!

520
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,913
It is?
Yes!

521
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,916
- Dad!
- Daddy!

522
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:42,578
- Where's Mr. Wagner?
- He left. He said
he was late for something.

523
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,587
What's wrong, sweetie?

524
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:47,920
The astronaut took her doll.
He took her doll?

525
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:51,894
That's it! Natalie,
it's all about the doll!

526
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:56,866
You said it was all about
the garage door!
It's about the doll and the garage doors!

527
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,925
It's about both!

528
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:06,937
Mr. Cain, where did you
get that doll?

529
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:09,741
I-
Come on.
You stole it, didn't you?

530
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,941
It was in a box
sitting on Joanne's front porch,

531
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:14,814
and you took it, just like you took
the Fruit of the Month box.

532
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,979
It was sitting there
for three days, all right?

533
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,489
I figured she wasn't home.
You're a horrible neighbor!

534
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,424
<i>Daddy!</i>

535
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:25,326
Honey, it's gonna be all right.

536
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,455
<i>I wanna go home, Daddy.</i>
It's gonna be okay.

537
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:30,296
It's gonna be all right.
Sweetie, come on.

538
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:32,461
<i>Huh?</i>

539
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:39,098
This is Captain Savo.
I just lost two of my civilians.
Notify the law enforcement desk.

540
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,909
Okay, thank you.
Captain's on his way.

541
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,972
We have to find Wagner
before he gets rid of that doll.

542
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,644
Monk, I don't understand.

543
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,153
Here's what happened.
Before he left,

544
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,656
<i>Wagner must have</i>
<i>gone to Joanne's house.</i>

545
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,658
<i>He drugged her,</i>
<i>but not enough to kill her.</i>

546
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:58,695
<i>Just enough to knock her out</i>
<i>for a couple of days.</i>

547
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,358
Then he built a machine-
a murder machine-

548
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:06,028
<i>a machine that would hang her on Wednesday,</i>
<i>long after he was gone.</i>

549
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,972
What kind of machine?
A garage door opener.

550
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,509
<i>He left her there drugged,</i>
<i>probably tied up,</i>

551
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:16,377
<i>and then took off into space</i>
<i>with the whole world watching.</i>

552
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:23,583
Mr. Monk,
what are you doing?

553
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,588
I don't know.

554
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,056
<i>They're at Ramp Two.</i>
<i>He's handling the missile.</i>

555
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,060
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Those are missiles!

556
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,426
Th-Th-They could be nuclear weapons!

557
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,624
Then stop me,
for the love of God.

558
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:38,897
It's all right.

559
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:44,933
I don't understand.
She died on Wednesday.
How did he activate the machine?

560
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:49,571
It was so simple,
it was brilliant.
He used a remote control.

561
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,810
<i>He taped it or glued it down</i>
<i>so it stayed on.</i>

562
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:56,718
<i>Then he put the remote control</i>
<i>inside one of those dolls.</i>

563
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:59,881
<i>Then he mailed it to her own house</i>
<i>second-day mail.</i>

564
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:02,050
<i>Second-day mail.</i>
<i>Wednesday morning!</i>

565
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,060
Exactly.
It was like a time bomb.

566
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:08,064
<i>The mailman delivered the remote control,</i>
<i>put it on the front porch.</i>

567
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:11,898
<i>On the other side of that door,</i>
<i>she was being strangled.</i>

568
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:16,668
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>But they found her in the living room.</i>

569
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:19,107
After he landed,
Wagner went back to her house.

570
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,941
He dismantled the machine
and moved her body
into the other room.

571
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,277
It was a perfect plan,
except for one thing.

572
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,578
<i>The doll was missing!</i>

573
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:30,747
<i>He must have panicked.</i>
<i>He went back there again</i>
<i>today to find it.</i>

574
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:33,881
<i>He knows that remote</i>
<i>can tie him to the murder.</i>

575
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:37,519
His fingerprints are all over it.
Excuse me. Hi.

576
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:40,257
Hey, nice ride.
Hi. Listen, we're looking
for Steve Wagner.

577
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:43,425
He may be on the flight line.
I think they just cleared him
for takeoff.

578
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,731
Great. We'd love to watch.
Which way?

579
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:49,739
You can't miss him.
He's in a brand-new F/A-22.

580
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:54,767
Oh. Uh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Hi. Hi. Hello again.

581
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:58,440
Could you settle a bet?
My friend and I were wondering if, uh,

582
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:03,180
somebody could drop anything
out of the cockpit of an F/A-22?

583
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,950
Of course, uh, I say no way.
Of course you can!

584
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:09,754
Like what?
Uh, you know, a Japanese doll.

585
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:14,059
- About this big.
- Well, there's an air lock,
like a chute,

586
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,065
to drop flares
and emergency transmitters.

587
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:18,294
I owe you one. Go figure.
Thank you!

588
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,564
<i>That's unbelievable.</i>
<i>You win that one.</i>
Wait a second.

589
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:23,106
- Hey, where's your escort?
- Just go. Just go, go, go!

590
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:26,302
<i>Where you goin'?</i>

591
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,586
No, no, no!
Mr. Monk, wait!

592
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:08,008
Wait up! Wagner!

593
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:10,645
Hey! Hey!

594
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,782
Hey! Hey!

595
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,421
<i>Pull over! Pull over!</i>

596
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:52,991
- Put your hands on your head
and get on your knees.

597
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:55,999
<i>Sir, step away from the jet.</i>

598
00:38:57,234 --> 00:39:01,295
<i>Please step away from the jet.</i>

599
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:08,404
- San Francisco Police Department!
That's my man out there!

600
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:12,745
Safe your weapons!
Stand down! I say again!
Safe your weapons! Stand down!

601
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:51,318
Captain-

602
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,616
The doll, sir.
Give me the doll.

603
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,788
<i>Security team,</i>
<i>secure the suspect.</i>

604
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,779
<i>Cuff the suspect</i>
<i>and secure the aircraft.</i>

605
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,821
<i>Control, suspect's secure.</i>

606
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:53,477
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Julie, come on.</i>

607
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:57,783
Mr. Monk,
Julie made something for you.

608
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:02,315
What?
Well, all my friends at school
were talking about what you did...

609
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:04,861
and how we were so wrong
about Mr. Wagner...

610
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:07,056
and how you caught him.

611
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,589
Well, um, anyways,
I made you this in art class.

612
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:15,868
Oh, Julie.
It's a Medal of Valor,

613
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,706
'cause you're the bravest man
I've ever known,
except for my father.

614
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:22,905
Oh, sweetie.
I'm gonna get the camera.

615
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:27,815
Well, I-Julie, thank you.
I-I mean, thank you.

616
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,752
What is that? A pin?
Yeah, it's okay.
I'll be careful.

617
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,450
Yeah, don't-Wait, wait, wait.
You know, that-
that can puncture the skin.

618
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,459
People get infected.
I'll just hold it.

619
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,552
How about that?
That's just as good.
Okay.

620
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:42,360
Okay. Smile.
You too, Rambo.

621
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,993
Hey, wait. Look.
It says "courage."
Yeah, I see that.

622
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,697
I see that.
Take- take the picture.

623
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:50,535
Okay. "Cheese!"
No flash. No flash.
Retinal scarring.
