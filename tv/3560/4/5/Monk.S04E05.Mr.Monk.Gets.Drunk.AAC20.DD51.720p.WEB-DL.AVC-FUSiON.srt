for three days.

Adrian solved the case in-
What was it, 12 minutes?

96
00:06:14,468 --> 00:06:17,733
L-I knew that the general's daughter
was lying about meeting Churchill,

97
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:20,706
because Churchill
wasn't knighted till 1953.

98

Which meant that Reginald,
the limping chauffeur who supplied her alibi, was also lying.

99
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:29,448

who were planning to kill the sultan...

00:09:50,017 --> 00:09:52,952
Mmm. Ah.

152
00:09:57,558 --> 00:10:01,324
Yours is even better. Much better.
All right, let's do it. Pass it down.

153
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:03,829
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

154
00:10:03,897 --> 00:10:07,765
Oh, transcendent.
Like a meal in itself.

155
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:14,167
Ah, just think, a week ago
I couldn't even afford a bottle of pop.

156
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,405
Oh, fabulous.
[Chuckles]

157
00:10:19,513 --> 00:10:21,606
Hey, are you all right?

158
00:10:21,682 --> 00:10:24,276
Not much of a drinker.

159
00:10:24,351 --> 00:10:27,718
Oh.
[Laughs] How many have you had?

160
00:10:27,788 --> 00:10:29,722
One bottle?
One sip.

161
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:34,022
Oh. Well, if you wake up tomorrow
and you're still hammered, you gotta come find me.

162
00:10:34,094 --> 00:10:36,619
I'm in Room 202,
by the back staircase.

163
00:10:36,697 --> 00:10:39,632
I got a great cure for a hangover.
It's 100% guaranteed.

164
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,328
<i>[Woman] I'm still in.</i>
<i>[Man] It's the psychiatrist</i> <i>you know so much of.</i>

165
00:10:42,402 --> 00:10:45,633
Um- So, um,
if you'll excuse me,

166
00:10:45,706 --> 00:10:50,075
I'm, uh, going to teach these rubes
how to play some cards. [Laughs]

167
00:10:50,144 --> 00:10:53,375
Nice knowin' ya. Hello.
Hello, everybody. Hi.

168
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:55,847
Hello.
So, uh, what are you playing?

169
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,850
It's a friendly little game.

170
00:10:57,918 --> 00:11:00,011
Oh. I thought you were
playing poker.

171
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:02,521
[Laughs]
Hey, is this seat taken?

172
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:05,353
No. Go ahead. Sit down.
Ah. Thank you.

173
00:11:05,425 --> 00:11:09,088
[Coughing]
I'm sorry. You know what? That's probably the Aqua Velva.

174
00:11:09,163 --> 00:11:11,188
Oh, my God. What did you do,
take a bath in it?

175
00:11:11,265 --> 00:11:14,666
No, I didn't,
but that's not a bad idea. I'll try it next time.

176
00:11:14,735 --> 00:11:16,669
Hey, Larry Zwibell.
Hey.

177
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:20,036
Hi. I brought a couple friends
with me. Maybe you'd all like to say hi.

178
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:23,167
Oh.
Ah. [Laughs]

179
00:11:23,243 --> 00:11:25,438
- Pierre LaCoste.
- Ah, <i>bonjour,</i> Pierre.

180
00:11:25,512 --> 00:11:27,446
<i>Bonjour.</i>
Cal Gefsky. Hi. How you doing?

181
00:11:27,514 --> 00:11:29,641
This is my wife, Heidi.
Heidi.

182
00:11:29,716 --> 00:11:33,015
Wife? I just can't
get used to that.

183
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:36,249
- Oh, we just got married on Saturday.
- <i>[Larry] Congratulations.</i>

184
00:11:36,323 --> 00:11:38,848
Oh, I'm Dr. David Sobin.
Nice to see you.

185
00:11:38,926 --> 00:11:40,985
He's a psychiatrist, you know,
so watch out for him.

186
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:43,256
A shrink? No, you're kidding.
Wait, hold on.

187
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,264
I got a great joke. Okay,
have you guys heard this one?

188
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:50,133
A guy goes to a psychiatrist,
and he says, "Doctor, my wife thinks she's a refrigerator."

189
00:11:50,204 --> 00:11:53,901
<i>And-And the psychiatrist says,</i>
<i>"Well, just ignore her."</i> <i>And the guy says, "I can't.</i>

190
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:57,239
When she sleeps with her mouth open,
the little light keeps me awake all night."

191
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,303
[Laughing]
The little light.

192
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,281
Hey, Adrian. What,
are you gonna give up? Uh, I think so.

193
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,410
Good night.
Oh, excuse me. Um, excuse me.

194
00:12:06,486 --> 00:12:09,080
Um, before you go,
would you take our picture? Uh, sure.

195
00:12:09,156 --> 00:12:11,556
Oh. Oh, good idea.
Okay.

196
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:17,927
Oh, oh.

197
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:20,933
Hold still.
Hold-Hold still.

198
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:24,596
Ready. Smile.

199
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:28,072
Wait. Let-Let's stand
oldest to youngest.

200
00:12:28,141 --> 00:12:31,269
So that would be you,
then you, then you. Mr. Monk.

201
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:33,336
I will take the picture.

202
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:39,485
[Beeps]
[Shutter Clicks]

203
00:12:55,702 --> 00:12:58,330
<i>Oh, Mr. Monk.</i>
<i>I was just coming to get you.</i>

204
00:12:58,405 --> 00:13:01,238
Shh.
It's a beautiful day. They have an amazing breakfast downstairs.

205
00:13:01,308 --> 00:13:03,299
Shh.

206
00:13:05,245 --> 00:13:08,009
Are you okay?
Mmm.

207
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:15,779
Were you drinking?
Just a little. Not even a glass.

208
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,049
[Groans]
Oh.

209
00:13:19,126 --> 00:13:23,688
Oh, I met a guy. He's in 202.
He said he had a cure for this.

210
00:13:23,764 --> 00:13:27,791
Uh, he said it was-
He said it was guaranteed.

211
00:13:27,868 --> 00:13:30,530
Well, here. 202.
202.

212
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:38,643
Larry? It's-It's Adrian
from last night.

213
00:13:38,712 --> 00:13:40,646
Hello?

214
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:43,911
Oh, sorry.
L-I was looking for Larry.

215
00:13:43,984 --> 00:13:47,317
Huh?
Ah, did you switch rooms?

216
00:13:47,387 --> 00:13:49,412
No, no.

217
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:52,788
Well, he said 202,
at the back.

218
00:13:52,859 --> 00:13:54,850
Well, who-who-who are you
talking about?

219
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,857
Larry- Larry Zwibell,

220
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:02,766
uh, from last night.

221
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:06,203
You played poker with him?
Uh, no, no, you're mistaken.

222
00:14:06,273 --> 00:14:11,006
You see, I don't know
anybody by this name. Excuse me. Pardon me.

223
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,913
Oh, good morning.
I hope you're hungry. Hi, good morning.

224
00:14:15,982 --> 00:14:18,542
Uh, we're looking for a guest-
a Larry Zwibell?

225
00:14:18,618 --> 00:14:23,214
Uh, who?
He checked in last night. You remember? Room 202.

226
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,953
Adrian, nobody checked in yesterday
except for you and Natalie.

227
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:30,690
No. No, no, no.
Sylvia, I talked to him.

228
00:14:30,764 --> 00:14:33,494
He-He- Larry Zwibell.

229
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:35,967
Uh, see for yourself.

230
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:46,976
He was here.
I talked to him.

231
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:49,413
You have to believe me.

232
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,044
Okay.

233
00:15:19,112 --> 00:15:21,512
There are three cars
in the parking lot, plus mine.

234
00:15:21,581 --> 00:15:25,244
The same three cars
that were there last night. Maybe he left.

235
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:27,946
That wouldn't explain
why everybody's lying.

236
00:15:28,021 --> 00:15:30,455
Then why didn't
he check in? He did check in.

237
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:33,516
He said Room 202. Look.

238
00:15:33,593 --> 00:15:37,154
We signed in on the bottom
of this page.

239
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,893
Sylvia could have removed
the next page.

240
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:43,231
Why would she do that,
Mr. Monk?

241
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:46,630
I don't know.

242
00:15:46,706 --> 00:15:49,368
Something happened.

243
00:15:49,443 --> 00:15:52,105
Something happened here.

244
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:56,639
Come on. Are you sure
you only had one drink?

245
00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:04,880
Natalie, I met him.

246
00:16:06,126 --> 00:16:08,594
He-He spoke Spanish,

247
00:16:08,662 --> 00:16:13,326
and he reeked of... Aqua Velva.

248
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:18,727
You believe me, right?

249
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:26,803
You said we have to believe each other.
You said that was the rule.

250
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,316
That's true. That's true.

251
00:16:36,957 --> 00:16:40,051
[Clears Throat]
Excuse me. I'm sorry to bother you all,

252
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:43,493
but we're looking for a guest,
Larry Zwibell.

253
00:16:43,563 --> 00:16:46,191
He was here last night.
Uh, who?

254
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:48,234
[Laughs]
I told you I never heard of him.

255
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:52,031
He played poker with you.

256
00:16:52,105 --> 00:16:54,869
He told you that joke
about the psychiatrist.

257
00:16:54,941 --> 00:16:57,535
<i>The wife who thinks</i>
<i>she's a refrigerator.</i>

258
00:16:57,611 --> 00:17:00,205
And the psychiatrist says,
"Just ignore it."

259
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,376
But the man says, "I can't,
because when she sleeps with her mouth open,

260
00:17:04,451 --> 00:17:07,284
the little light inside her mouth
keeps me awake."

261
00:17:07,354 --> 00:17:09,379
[All Laughing]
That's brilliant.

262
00:17:09,456 --> 00:17:12,823
Why-Why are you laughing?
Because it's funny.

263
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:17,193
B-B-But you already heard it.
You heard it last night.

264
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:23,094
They already heard it.
Maybe it's your delivery.

265
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:27,503
[Sighs] Did you notice
the French guy did this?

266
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:31,010
That's his tell. I was watching him
play poker last night.

267
00:17:31,077 --> 00:17:34,103
Whenever he bluffed,
he rubbed his nose.

268
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,911
I'm telling you.
He did it upstairs earlier too.

269
00:17:37,984 --> 00:17:39,918
He's lying. They are all lying.

270
00:17:39,986 --> 00:17:42,420
It's- It's a conspiracy.

271
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:45,424
Mr. Monk, why?

272
00:17:45,492 --> 00:17:47,653
They don't even know each other.

273
00:17:49,262 --> 00:17:52,390
Ah, Ricardo.
<i>Señor?</i>

274
00:17:55,735 --> 00:17:58,260
Ricardo, you remember
my friend?

275
00:17:58,338 --> 00:18:01,432
He- He was sitting with me
at that table right there.

276
00:18:01,508 --> 00:18:04,443
He spoke Spanish to you.
He ordered the Degout pinot.

277
00:18:04,511 --> 00:18:07,071
I am sorry, <i>señor.</i>

278
00:18:07,147 --> 00:18:09,581
There was no one there.
You were alone all night.

279
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:11,844
Ricardo.
Excuse me.

280
00:18:19,426 --> 00:18:22,589
Well, you're gettin'
an early start. [Laughs]

281
00:18:22,662 --> 00:18:25,096
The tasting doesn't begin
until noon.

282
00:18:25,165 --> 00:18:27,156
May I?

283
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:29,497
Oh, they make this here.

284
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:32,629
Mmm. They just released it
this morning.

285
00:18:32,706 --> 00:18:35,698
How is it?
It's good. It's, uh- It's sweet.

286
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:40,474
But it has a, um-
has a weird aftertaste to it. Ahh.

287
00:18:40,547 --> 00:18:44,574
Do you taste it?
Mmm, no, not really.

288
00:18:44,651 --> 00:18:47,142
I'm a little bit worried
about your friend.

289
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,816
I'm a psychiatrist,
and I saw him yesterday talking to an empty chair.

290
00:18:51,891 --> 00:18:56,055
Oh, yeah, he does that.
His wife died eight years ago. He talks to her.

291
00:18:56,129 --> 00:19:00,589
Mrs. Willis said
he used to be a detective. He was discharged.

292
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:03,067
May I ask, why is he here?

293
00:19:03,136 --> 00:19:07,129
Well, it's his anniversary,
and they honeymooned here, so-

294
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:12,873
So, this is probably a...
time of stress for him?

295
00:19:12,946 --> 00:19:14,914
Does he handle stress well?

296
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:17,142
No. He handles stress unwell.

297
00:19:17,217 --> 00:19:23,122
Lonely, uh, children, uh, will sometimes
make up a person in their minds-

298
00:19:23,189 --> 00:19:26,556
an imaginary friend,
if you will.

299
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:30,084
I've seen it a lot in my practice.
I've seen adults do it too.

300
00:19:30,163 --> 00:19:33,257
Well, you don't know Adrian Monk.
He's a great detective.

301
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,097
The police don't make a move
without talking to him first.

302
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:38,364
Now, I don't know
what's going on here,

303
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:43,967
but if he says he met a man
named Larry Zwibell, then he met a man named Larry Zwibell.

304
00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:48,712
Oh, this is interesting.

305
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:53,844
There's nothing upstairs.

306
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,854
What's going on?

307
00:19:55,922 --> 00:19:59,949
Uh, excuse me.

308
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:10,062
- <i>[Natalie]</i>
<i>What do you think?</i> - About what?

309
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:12,127
The signature.

310
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:15,498
The painter.

311
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:19,033
He has the same name as-
As my hallucination?

312
00:20:19,112 --> 00:20:21,342
Hey, I didn't say that.

313
00:20:21,414 --> 00:20:25,748
But, Mr. Monk, you gotta admit
it looks kind of bad.

314
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:31,780
People might think
that you saw the name...

315
00:20:31,858 --> 00:20:33,883
and made up a person.

316
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,230
Or the man I met...

317
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:43,929
saw the name on that painting...

318
00:20:44,003 --> 00:20:46,836
and decided to use it for himself.

319
00:20:55,148 --> 00:20:57,514
The camera.

320
00:20:59,252 --> 00:21:01,880
Natalie, they took a photo
last night-

321
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:05,584
a-a-a group photo-
and he was in it. <i>[Door Closes]</i>

322
00:21:05,658 --> 00:21:08,525
And this is our 2002
cabernet sauvignon.

323
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:13,760
I think you'll like it.
It's slightly softer and more tannic than the merlot.

324
00:21:16,603 --> 00:21:19,800
You've got to get
that camera. Okay.

325
00:21:19,873 --> 00:21:22,171
All right, but you stay here.

326
00:21:22,242 --> 00:21:24,176
Ah. Will you be joining us?
Yes.

327
00:21:24,244 --> 00:21:26,542
Good. The more the merrier.
Thank you.

328
00:21:26,613 --> 00:21:29,013
Next we're going to try
the Syrah.

329
00:21:29,082 --> 00:21:33,382
<i>Now, the Syrah comes</i>
<i>from our very own grapes</i> <i>in the east vineyard.</i>

330
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:37,322
What are you drinking?

331
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,951
Uh, it's the, uh-
the Sierra Springs.

332
00:21:41,027 --> 00:21:43,518
How is it?
It's exquisite.

333
00:21:43,596 --> 00:21:47,862
Is this your first wine tasting?

334
00:21:47,934 --> 00:21:51,563
I'll explain what they're doing.
There are five steps. We call them the "Five S's"-

335
00:21:51,638 --> 00:21:53,799
Mm-hmm.
See, swirl, sniff, sip and spit.

336
00:21:53,873 --> 00:21:58,139
Now, they're on step one.
How does the wine look?

337
00:21:58,211 --> 00:22:00,441
Is it rich in color?
Does it react with the light?

338
00:22:00,513 --> 00:22:03,311
Excuse me.
Uh, what was that last one,

339
00:22:03,383 --> 00:22:06,352
uh, step five?
Spit.

340
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:11,322
So, they're-they're-they're
going to be spitting? That's it.

341
00:22:11,391 --> 00:22:15,157
Mmm. Here. I can hold
your camera for you. Oh, I'm good.

342
00:22:15,228 --> 00:22:17,890
- <i>Now they're on step three.</i>
- Oh, step three.

343
00:22:17,964 --> 00:22:20,762
Sniffing. You smell the wine.
Inhale deeply.

344
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:22,768
Do you smell the fruit
or the herbs?

345
00:22:22,836 --> 00:22:26,533
Uh, so that means, really,
there's only two steps left until the spitting.

346
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:30,098
That's right.
Uh, all-all at once?

347
00:22:30,176 --> 00:22:35,409
All of them spitting on the-
on the porch here, uh, with me on-on the porch?

348
00:22:35,481 --> 00:22:39,417
- <i>Now they're sipping.</i>
- Sipping? So spitting is next. Oh, God.

349
00:22:39,485 --> 00:22:41,680

How about a group shot?
A little newlywed group shot. Um-

355
00:22:54,334 --> 00:22:57,565
I'll take it.
No. Maybe later.

356
00:22:58,771 --> 00:23:02,901
Oh, my God.
It's a kissing fern.

357
00:23:02,976 --> 00:23:05,774
A what?
Yeah. They're called kissing ferns.

358
00:23:05,845 --> 00:23:09,406
It's supposed to be good luck
for newlyweds to kiss underneath one.

359
00:23:09,482 --> 00:23:14,112
Have you heard that song?
"Kiss Me Under the Kissing Fern, Baby"?

00:23:14,187 --> 00:23:16,155
Mmm.

Mr. Monk, some people
just have no tolerance.

384
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:46,102
I used to work in a bar.
I saw it all the time.

385
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:51,446
You had two sips. That's like 10 shots
to a normal person. Thank you.

Hey, folks. How you doin'?

Listen, I'm lookin' for my brother.
He's gone missing.

Have you seen him?

- Really?
- That's him.

393
00:25:14,407 --> 00:25:16,398
Wanna tell me about it?

394
00:25:21,674 --> 00:25:25,337
I don't know what he told you, you know.
His real name is Ben Gruber.

395
00:25:25,411 --> 00:25:27,345
Our mother's been
worried sick about him.

396
00:25:27,413 --> 00:25:30,746
Thank God. I thought
I was losing my mind.

397
00:25:30,817 --> 00:25:33,047
I knew he was into wine,
so I've been checkin' all the vineyards...

398
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,179
- and the little hotels in the area.
- And you're his brother?

00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,191
- Allen. Allen Gruber. Pleasure.
- Hi. Natalie Teeger.

<i>This is Adrian Monk.</i>

<i>Everybody here is pretending</i> <i>they never met him?</i>

Everyone.
Aw, poor kid.

403
00:25:48,334 --> 00:25:50,700
- He's gotta be scared to death.
- Why?

404
00:25:52,972 --> 00:25:56,806
He stole some money from a bank
that he works for, right?

405
00:25:56,876 --> 00:25:58,810
And he took off.

406
00:25:58,878 --> 00:26:02,575
I talked to the local D.A., and she said,
you know, they'd go easy on him if he turned himself in.

407
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:05,709
That's why I'm here.
I figured, you know, if I showed up,

408
00:26:05,785 --> 00:26:08,777
maybe I could find him,
maybe I could talk him into returning the money.

409
00:26:08,855 --> 00:26:10,914
- How much did he take?
- $3.1 million.

410
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,924
Whew.
[Exhales]

411
00:26:12,992 --> 00:26:16,155
Although it sounds like
he's spending some of it already.

412
00:26:16,229 --> 00:26:20,598
He's been paying people off
to say they've never heard of him.

413
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:22,965
<i>Do you think he's still here?</i>

414
00:26:23,036 --> 00:26:25,027
I mean, why would he stay?

415
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:30,407
What was he driving?
'86 Buick, last I heard.

416
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:39,848
What are the odds?
An '86 Buick.

417
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,253
Well, it can't be his.
This car has been here forever. Mmm, I don't think so.

418
00:26:44,324 --> 00:26:47,657
There's a dent here,
but no rust.

419
00:26:47,727 --> 00:26:49,922
And there's no rust
in the wheel wells.

420
00:26:49,996 --> 00:26:52,123
This car hasn't been here long.

421
00:26:52,198 --> 00:26:56,032
So he's still here
somewhere, right? Well, he's not in that house.

422
00:26:57,103 --> 00:26:59,663
And we call this
the barrel room.

423
00:26:59,739 --> 00:27:04,267
These containers are filled
with 60 gallons of our world-famous chardonnay.

424
00:27:04,344 --> 00:27:07,802
It's gonna age in these containers
for exactly 11 months.

425
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,749
I like to think of it as a living thing,
like a baby growing inside a mother's womb.

426
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:15,788
Mr. Gruber.
I thought we'd lost you.

427
00:27:15,855 --> 00:27:18,517
Oh, sorry.
I just got turned around.

428
00:27:28,401 --> 00:27:31,996
If you follow me,
we're literally going to be stepping back in time.

429
00:27:32,071 --> 00:27:37,532
Wine stomping. It's a tradition
that goes back thousands of years to the Greeks.

430
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:43,571
We're one of the last vineyards in California
that at least make some of their wine using this method.

431
00:27:48,321 --> 00:27:51,222
<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

432
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:54,123
Do people actually
drink that? Yeah, I think so.

433
00:27:54,193 --> 00:27:57,356
Are they insane?
Go ask her if they're insane.

434
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,922
J-Just ask her.
I'm not gonna ask her that, Mr. Monk.

435
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,401
And of course, we can't press
all of our wine like this. It would take too long.

436
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,530
But we do make one label
using this method,

437
00:28:07,607 --> 00:28:09,575
the Allacco Cabernet.
[Yelps]

438
00:28:09,642 --> 00:28:12,236
It can be bought from
our store out front.

439
00:28:12,311 --> 00:28:14,541
Uh-
[Gags]

440

<i>[Natalie]</i> <i>I know. Just take it easy.</i>

441
00:28:19,485 --> 00:28:23,046
I've been drinking that wine
for 15 years. It's foot wine.

442
00:28:24,457 --> 00:28:27,449
I can taste it.
Oh, well, come on. You cannot taste it.

443
00:28:27,527 --> 00:28:30,690
L-l-I can.
I can taste the feet now.

444

I can taste-And the toes-
What's between the toe-

445
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,901
And the fungus.
It really is barbaric.

446

Yes, I can. Okay.

I'll have that.
Could you put it in a carafe?

Uh, you don't have to bring the bottle.
You got it. We'll bring it over to you.

00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:02,260
I'm gonna get me one.
Up to bed.

598
00:38:02,337 --> 00:38:04,328
Oh, w-wait!

599
00:38:10,012 --> 00:38:12,879
<i>See, Gruber never came back.</i>

600
00:38:12,948 --> 00:38:17,442
<i>They got worried</i>
<i>and decided to go upstairs</i> <i>and check on him.</i>

601
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:20,818
<i>They found Ben Gruber dead.</i>

602
00:38:20,889 --> 00:38:23,687
<i>He was dead from a heart attack.</i>

603
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:28,958
<i>And cash</i>- <i>$3. 1 million.</i>

604
00:38:29,031 --> 00:38:32,694
[No Audible Dialogue]
<i>They must have figured somebody</i> <i>would be comin'around lookin'for it.</i>

605
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,931
<i>That's the kind of money</i>
<i>people come lookin'for.</i>

606
00:38:36,004 --> 00:38:39,132
<i>What to do? What to do?</i>

607
00:38:40,209 --> 00:38:43,940
<i>Well, they decided to hide the body</i>
<i>and split the money.</i>

608
00:38:44,012 --> 00:38:47,948
<i>If anybody asked,</i>
<i>they were gonna pretend</i> <i>they never heard ofhim.</i>

609
00:38:51,887 --> 00:38:53,878
Hold on.

610
00:38:57,493 --> 00:39:02,021
[Sighs, Sniffs]
Here's what happened.

611
00:39:02,097 --> 00:39:05,692
If we don't take the money-
[Continues, Indistinct] <i>They got rid of Gruber's car.</i>

612
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:09,931
<i>Then they removed the page</i>
<i>with his signature...</i>

613
00:39:10,005 --> 00:39:12,098
<i>from the guest book.</i>

614
00:39:12,174 --> 00:39:15,439
<i>And retook the group photo</i>
<i>without him.</i>

615
00:39:15,511 --> 00:39:19,538
<i>He was gone.</i>
<i>It was like he never existed.</i>

616
00:39:19,615 --> 00:39:21,845
<i>[Shutter Clicks]</i>
<i>Gone like a ghost.</i>

617
00:39:22,951 --> 00:39:26,387
- Did you find the money?
- Not yet.

618
00:39:26,455 --> 00:39:29,253
<i>He says there was a conspiracy,</i>
<i>and we all took the money.</i>

619
00:39:29,324 --> 00:39:34,159
I say this character Gruber
junked his own car,

620
00:39:34,229 --> 00:39:37,255
took the cash,
and hitchhiked to Mexico.

621
00:39:37,332 --> 00:39:40,597
Can you prove
I'm wrong? Nope.

622
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,297
He's right. Without a body,
we don't have a case.

623
00:39:43,372 --> 00:39:45,306
<i>[Snoring]</i>
Monk?

624
00:39:46,608 --> 00:39:48,542
Monk.

625
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,635
[Snoring Continues]

626
00:39:50,712 --> 00:39:54,773
Okay, um, I guess
you're all free to go.

627
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,047
Lieutenant, take everybody's address.
Make sure it's a valid I.D.

628
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:02,079
Yes, sir. Uh, if everybody could
just follow me. We're sorry about the inconvenience.

629
00:40:03,525 --> 00:40:05,459
[Sighs]
What is it?

630
00:40:05,527 --> 00:40:08,860
What is what?
<i>This is their new wine.</i> <i>They bottle it next door.</i>

631
00:40:08,931 --> 00:40:12,867
But it has this funky, weird aftertaste,
and I cannot put my finger on it.

632
00:40:12,935 --> 00:40:16,063
Here.
[Sniffs]

633
00:40:17,072 --> 00:40:19,734
It smells like Aqua Velva.

634
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:22,436
Oh, my God.
<i>[Snoring Continues]</i>

635
00:40:22,511 --> 00:40:26,140
Oh, my God.
It's Aqua Velva.

636
00:40:27,316 --> 00:40:29,443
It's Aqua Velva.

637
00:40:29,518 --> 00:40:31,452
[Mutters]
It's Aqua Velva.

638
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,579
[Chattering]

639
00:40:46,602 --> 00:40:49,435
[LaCoste]
It was the old lady's idea!

640
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,668
<i>[Natalie]</i>
<i>What's gonna happen to them?</i>

641
00:40:53,735 --> 00:40:57,728
<i>[Stottlemeyer]</i>
<i>They didn't kill anybody,</i> <i>so they'll probably be home soon.</i>

642
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:02,601
Uh, he's a real party animal.
[Laughs]

643
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:07,273
Okay. You drive safely, Natalie.

644
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:10,409
We'll see you around campus.
Thank you, Captain. I will.

645
00:41:14,256 --> 00:41:17,123
Happy anniversary, Adrian.

646
00:41:17,192 --> 00:41:20,025
Sorry I didn't believe you.
