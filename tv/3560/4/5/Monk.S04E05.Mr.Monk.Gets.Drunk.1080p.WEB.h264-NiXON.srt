你喜欢酒吗，娜塔莉?
Uh, do you enjoy wine, Natalie?

144
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,574
比我应该做的多一点。
A little more than I should.

145
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,776
哦，那你一定要加入我们。
Oh, then you must join us.

146
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,079
艾利安，你不喝酒
Uh, Adrian, you don't drink,

147
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,781
你呢?不。

这是你的钥匙。
Here are your keys.

150
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,552
你知道路。

151
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,622
如果你有什么需要，尽管打电话。
Now, if you need anything, you just call.

152
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,723

00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,927
娜塔莉，我要在这里坐一会儿。
Natalie, I'm going to sit down here for a little while.

154
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,862
这是一种传统。
It's sort of a tradition.

155
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,665
你想找人陪你吗?

156
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,601
不，不，我没事的。我不会孤单的。

休息一下。
Get some rest.

160
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:45,632
我没有一天不想你。
Not a day goes by when I don't think about you.

161
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,569
我从没觉得跟你这么亲近过
And I-I never feel as close to you

162
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:52,906
就像我在这里一样
as I do when I'm here.

163
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,808
它总是——

它是1984。
It's 1984.

166

是的，先生，1984年的Allacco解百纳。
Yes, sir. Allacco Cabernet, 1984.

上面有你的名字。
It had your name on it.

168
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,593
这是我妻子的最爱。

169

你在想什么?
What were you thinking?

173
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:00,106
我——我很抱歉。可能是我。

174
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,808
我对水Velva有点热情。
I was a little enthusiastic with the Aqua Velva.

175
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,610
你介意我休息一下吗?
Do you mind if I rest my cheeks?

176
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,913
事实上，我喜欢哦，如果有人来，我就起来。
Actually, I do-- Oh, well, if someone comes, I'll get up.

177
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:08,280
我讨厌一个人喝酒。
[whispers] I hate drinking alone.

178
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,583
呃，麻烦你一下?

179
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:11,884

我，我懂两种语言。
Oh, I'm--I'm, uh, bilingual.

183
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,928
我母亲是委内瑞拉人。
My mother was Venezuelan.

184
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,596
这意味着我可以让自己出丑
That means I can make an ass of myself

185
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,298
两种语言。(笑)
in two languages. [laughs]

186
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:29,602
哦，不好意思。对不起，对不起。

艾利安，很高兴认识你。
Adrian, nice to know you.

192
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:42,682
什么风把你吹来了?
So what brings you here?

193
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:44,183
你是来参加什么，品酒会的吗?
Are you here for the, uh-- what, the wine tasting?

194
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,653
不，我每年都来。这是一种传统。

嗯,毫米毫米。毫米。
Mm, mm-mm. Mm.

199
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:06,239
哦,超验。
Oh, transcendent.

200
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,075
就像一顿饭。
Like a meal in itself.

201
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,043
哦，想想看。
Oh, just think.

202
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:14,947
一周前，我甚至买不起一瓶汽水。
A week ago, I couldn't even afford a bottle of pop.

203
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:19,186
哦,令人难以置信的。嗯。
Oh, fabulous. Hmm.

204

207
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:30,062
一个瓶子吗?一个sip。

208
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,664
哦。
Oh.

209
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,667
好吧，如果你明天醒来还醉着，
Well, if you wake up tomorrow and you're still hammered,

210
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:34,500
你得来找我。

211
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,669
我在后面楼梯旁的202房间。
I'm in room 202 by the back staircase.

212

我找到了很好的治疗方法
I got a great cure

213

215
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:47,346
所以，如果你不介意的话，我要
So, um, if you'll excuse me, I'm, uh--

216
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:49,817
我要教这些乡巴佬怎么打扑克。
I'm gonna teach these rubes how to play some poker.

217

这是一个友好的小游戏。

我以为你在打扑克。

00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:08,467
抱歉，那。你知道吗?
I'm sorry, that's-- you know what?

227
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,469
这可能是Aqua Velva。
That's probably the Aqua Velva.

228
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:10,336
天啊，你做了什么?
Oh, my God, what'd you do?

229
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,337
在里面洗澡?
Take a bath in it?

230
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,339
不，我没有。
No, I didn't.

231
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,041
但这不是一个坏主意。

我下次再试试。

我妻子认为她是一台冰箱。”
my wife thinks  she's a refrigerator."

255
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,211
精神病医生说:“好吧，别理她。”
And the psychiatrist says,  "Well, just ignore her."

256

(叹息)
[groans]

280
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,423
你喝酒了吗?
Were you drinking?

281
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,525
只是…一点。
Just...a little.

282
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,128
连一杯都没有。
Not even a glass.

他住202号房。

他说他有治疗方法。

他说，他说这是有保证的。

你在说谁?

不，不。你错了。

你看，我不认识叫这个名字的人。

艾利安，昨天没人登记入住
Adrian, nobody checked in yesterday

311
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,433
除了你和娜塔莉
except for you and Natalie.

312
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,001
不。不，不，不。西尔维娅。

我跟他谈过了。

他在这里。我跟他谈过了。

你必须相信我。

和昨晚停在那里的三辆车一样。
The same three cars that were there last night.

321
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:25,658
也许他离开了。

322
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:28,528
但这不能解释为什么大家都在说谎。
But that wouldn't explain why everybody's lying.

323
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:31,431
那他为什么不去报到?他没有登记入住。

00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:39,005
我们在这一页的底部签了名。
We signed in on the bottom of this page.

327
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,474
她本可以删掉下一页的。
She could've removed the next page.

328
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:45,144
她为什么要这么做，蒙先生?
Why would she do that, Mr. Monk?

329
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,147
我不知道。
I don't know.

330
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,682
发生了一件事。

这里发生了一些事情。

00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:58,057
你确定你只喝了一杯吗?
Are you sure you only had one drink?

334
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:05,697
娜塔莉，我见过他。

335
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,701
他会说西班牙语。
He--he spoke Spanish.

336
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:14,173
他身上散发着水Velva的味道。
And he reeked of Aqua Velva.

337
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,711
你相信我，对吧?
You believe me, right?

338
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:25,618
你说过我们要相信彼此。
You said we have to believe each other.

339
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,586
你说这是规则。
You said that was the rule.

340
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,489
这是真的。
That's true.

341
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,724
这是真的。
That's true.

342
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:39,231
(清了清喉咙)
[clears throat]

343
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,633
不好意思，打扰你们了。
Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you all.

344
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:44,236
但我们在找客人。拉里Zwibell。
But we're looking for a guest. Larry Zwibell.

345
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,039
他昨晚在这儿。谁?
He was here last night. Who?

346
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,076
我说过我没听说过他。
I told you I never heard of him.

347
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:52,578
他和你一起打扑克。
He played poker with you.

348
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,715
他跟你讲了那个心理医生的笑话。
He told you that joke about the psychiatrist.

349
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,384
觉得自己是冰箱的妻子。
The wife who thinks  she's a refrigerator.

350
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:01,221
精神科医生说"别理它"
And the psychiatrist says, "Just ignore it."

351
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,322
但是男人说:“我不能，因为当她睡觉的时候
But the man says, "I can't because when she sleeps

352
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,723
“她张着嘴，
"with her mouth open,

353
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:08,228
她嘴里的小光让我睡不着。”
the little light inside her mouth keeps me awake."

354
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,462
(笑声)太棒了。
[laughter] That's brilliant.

355
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:11,763
你笑什么?
Why are you laughing?

356
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,732
因为这很有趣。
Because it's funny.

357
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,301
但你已经听过了。
B-b-but you already heard it.

358
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:18,037
你昨晚也听到了。
You heard it last night.

359
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:22,741
他们已经听到了。
They already heard it.

360
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,243
也许是你送货的问题。
Maybe it's your delivery.

361
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:28,080
你注意到那个法国人这样做了吗?
Did you notice the French guy did this?

362
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:29,382
他就是这么说的。
That's his tell.

363
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,718
昨晚我在看他打扑克。
I was watching him play poker last night.

364
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,686
每当他虚张声势时，他就揉鼻子。
Whenever he bluffed, he rubbed his nose.

365
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:38,458
我跟你说，他之前也在楼上干过。
I'm telling you, he did it upstairs earlier too.

366
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,593
他是在撒谎。他们都在撒谎。
He's lying. They are all lying.

367
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,296
这是个阴谋。
It's--it's a conspiracy.

368
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,298
蒙先生，为什么?
Mr. Monk, why?

369
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:49,469
他们甚至不认识对方。
They don't even know each other.

370
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:50,603
啊。
Ah.

371
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,239
里卡多。先生吗?
Ricardo. Señor?

372
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,272
里卡多。
Ricardo.

373
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:59,145
里卡多，你还记得我的朋友吧。
Ricardo, you remember my friend.

374
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:02,315
他，他当时和我一起坐在那张桌子上。
He was--he was sitting with me at that table right there.

375
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:03,715
他跟你说西班牙语。
He spoke Spanish to you.

376
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,317
他点了Degout Pinot。
He ordered the Degout Pinot.

377
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:08,788
对不起，Señor。那里一个人也没有。
I am sorry, Señor. There was no one there.

378
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,390
你一整晚都是一个人。
You were alone all night.

379
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,660
里卡多打扰一下。
Ricardo-- Excuse me.

380
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,669
你起得真早啊。
Well, you're getting an early start.

381
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:25,505
试吃要中午才开始。
The tasting doesn't begin until noon.

382
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,640
我可以吗?确定。

383
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:31,178
哦，他们在这里做这个。毫米。
Oh, they make this here. Mm.

384
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,444
他们今早才发布的。
They just released it this morning.

385
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,381
它是怎样的?
And how is it?

386
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,583
很好。这…这很甜蜜。
It's good. It's, uh-- It's sweet.

387
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,684
但是它有一个
But it has a, um--

388
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:41,288
它有一种奇怪的余味。
It has a weird aftertaste to it.

389
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,388
你尝过了吗?
Do you taste it?

390
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:44,624
不，不完全是。
No, not really.

391
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,759
我有点担心你的朋友。
I'm a little bit worried about your friend.

392
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,896
我是心理医生，我昨天见过他
I'm a psychiatrist, and I saw him yesterday

393
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,699
对着空椅子说话。
talking to an empty chair.

394
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:53,665
哦，是的，他就是这么做的。
Oh, yeah, he does that.

395
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,669
他的妻子八年前去世了。他和她说话。
His wife died eight years ago. He talks to her.

396
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,205
威利斯太太说他以前是个侦探。
Mrs. Willis said he used to be a detective.

397
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,906
他出院了?
He was discharged?

398
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,410
我能问一下，他为什么在这里吗?
May I ask, why is he here?

399
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:07,279
今天是他的周年纪念日，他们在这里度蜜月，所以。
Well, it's his anniversary, and they honeymooned here, so.

400
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,681
所以。
So.

401
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:12,318
这可能是他压力很大的时候。
This is probably a time of stress for him.

402
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,921
他能很好地处理压力吗?

403
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:18,790
不。他不能很好地处理压力。

404
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:23,796
孤独的孩子有时会在心里编造一个人。
Lonely children will sometimes make up a person in their minds.

405
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,766
一个想象中的朋友，如果你愿意的话。
An imaginary friend, if you will.

406
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,435
我在实践中见过很多次。
I've seen it a lot in my practice.

407
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:30,769
我也见过成年人这么做。
I've seen adults do it too.

408
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,771
你不了解艾德里安·蒙克。
Well, you don't know Adrian Monk.

409
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:33,940
他是个伟大的侦探。
He's a great detective.

410
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:37,243
警察没有和他谈过是不会采取行动的。
The police don't make a move without talking to him first.

411
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:39,211
我不知道这是怎么回事。
I don't know what's going on here.

412
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:41,713
但如果他说他见过一个叫拉里·兹维贝尔的人，
But if he says he met a man named Larry Zwibell,

413
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:45,384
然后他遇到了一个叫拉里·兹维贝尔的人。
then he met a man named Larry Zwibell.

414
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:49,588
哦。这很有趣。
Oh. This is interesting.

415
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,626
楼上什么都没有。
There's nothing upstairs.

416
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:56,663
这是怎么呢
What's going on?

417
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:00,633
嗯…原谅我。
Um...excuse me.

418
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,973
娜塔莉:你怎么看?
(Natalie)  What do you think?

419
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,442

画家。

他的名字和……
He has the same name as...

423
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,419
是我的幻觉?
As my hallucination?

424
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,587
嘿，我可没那么说。
Hey, I didn't say that.

425
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,490
蒙先生，你得承认
Now, Mr. Monk, you gotta admit,

426
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:26,558
看起来有点糟糕。
it looks kinda bad.

427
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:30,430
人们可能会认为你…
People might think that you...

428
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,798
看到这个名字…
saw the name and...

429
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,767
编了一个人。
made up a person.

430
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:41,574
或者是我遇到的那个男人
Or the man I met

431
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,711
看到画上的名字了
saw the name on that painting

432
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,747
然后决定为自己所用。
and decided to use it for himself.

433
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,357
相机。
The camera.

434
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:02,494
娜塔莉，他们昨晚拍了张照片。
Natalie, they took a photo last night.

435
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:04,497
合影。
A-a-a group photo.

436
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,398
他就在里面。
And he was in it.

437
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:10,369
这是我们2002年的赤霞珠。
And this is our 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon.

438
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:11,671
我想你会喜欢的。
I think you'll like it.

439
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:14,807
它比梅洛(Merlot)更柔和，单宁含量更高。
It's slightly softer and more tannic than the Merlot.

440
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,512
你一定要拿到那个相机。
You've got to get that camera.

441
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:21,780
你待在这里。
You stay here.

442
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,584
你会加入我们吗?
Ah, will you  be joining us?

443
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,984
是的。好。
Yes. Good.

444
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,519
人越多越好。谢谢你！
The more the merrier. Thank you.

445
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:29,689
接下来，我们要尝尝西拉酒。
Next, we're going to try the Syrah.

446
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,692
现在，西拉是用我们自己的葡萄酿造的
Now, the Syrah comes from our very own grapes

447
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:35,060
在东边的葡萄园。
in the east vineyard.

448
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:37,596
你在喝什么?
What are you drinking?

449
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,567
呃，是Sierra Springs。
Uh, it's the, uh, the Sierra Springs.

450
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:43,035
怎么样?
How is it?

451
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,403
它是精致的。
It's exquisite.

452
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:48,474
这是……第一次品酒?
Is this... your first wine tasting?

453
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:49,476
我会解释他们在做什么。
I'll explain what they're doing.

454
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:52,378
有五个步骤。我们称它们为五个s。
There are five steps. We call them the five Ss.

455
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:54,881
看，旋，闻，抿，吐。
See, swirl, sniff, sip, and spit.

456
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:58,417
现在，他们正处于第一步。这酒看起来怎么样?
Now, they're on step one. How does the wine look?

457
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:01,119
它颜色丰富吗?它会和光发生反应吗?
Is it rich in color? Does it react with the light?

458
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,955
不好意思，最后一个是什么?
Excuse me--uh, what was that last one?

459
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,758
第五步。
Uh, step five.

460
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,026
随地吐痰。
Spit.

461
00:22:07,058 --> 00:22:10,396
所以，他们要吐痰了?
So, th-th-they're going to be...spitting?

462
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,963
就是这样。
That's it.

463
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,799
我可以帮你拿着相机。
Mmm, I can hold your camera for you.

464
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,768
哦，我很好。
Oh, I'm good.

465
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,636
现在他们到了第三步。
Now they're  on step three.

466
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,671
哦，第三步。
Oh, step three.

467
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,539
嗅探。你闻到了酒的味道。
Sniffing. You smell the wine.

468
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:21,607
深深地吸气。
Inhale deeply.

469
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:23,675
你闻到水果味还是香草味了?
Do you smell the fruit or the herbs?

470
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,778
也就是说，真的，只剩下两步了
Uh, so that means, really, there's only two steps left

471
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,614
直到……吐痰。
until the...spitting.

472
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,080
这是正确的。
That's right.

473
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:30,750
一次就全部搞定?
Uh, all--all at once?

474
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,819
他们都在走廊上吐痰吗?
All of them spitting on the porch here?

475
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,121
和我在门廊上?
With me on the porch?

476
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,788
现在他们正在啜饮。
Now they're sipping.

477
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:37,690
喝? !
Sipping?!

478
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:40,125
所以吐痰是下一个。哦,上帝。
So spitting is next. Oh, God.

479
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,394
哦，它来了。
Oh, here it comes.

480
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:43,962
哦!
Ohh!

481
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:46,665
(阿蒙)啊!
(Monk)  Aah!

482
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,769
(笑声)
[laughter]

483
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,704
这真是太有趣了，不是吗?
This is so much fun, isn't it?

484
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:55,106
来张集体照怎么样?新婚夫妇的合影。
How about a group shot? A little newlywed group shot.

485
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:56,742
我买了。哦，也许以后吧。
I'll take it. Oh, maybe later.

486
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:01,513
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

487
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:02,815
这是一种吻蕨。
It's a kissing fern.

488
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,683
一个什么?
A what?

489
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,653
是的。它们叫做吻蕨。
Yeah. They're called kissing ferns.

490
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,621
这对新婚夫妇来说应该是好运
It's supposed to be good luck for newlyweds

491
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:10,122
在其中亲吻。
to kiss underneath one.

492
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,657
你没听过那首歌吗?
Haven't you heard that song?

493
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:15,193
在吻蕨下吻我，宝贝
* Kiss me under the kissing fern, baby *

494
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,631
蕨类植物……是的，是的，好的，是的。
Fern...yeah, yeah, okay, yeah.

495
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:21,701
好吧，既然这样，呃…
Yeah, okay, well, in that case, uh...

496
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,536
[娜塔莉清了清嗓子]
[Natalie clears throat]

497
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:24,804
是的。
Yeah.

498
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,838
在这里吗?准备好了吗?
Here? Ready?

499
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:28,974
哦,哇。你不明白。
Oh, wow. You don't get it.

500
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:31,042
太可爱了。让我拍张照片。
It's so cute. Let me take a picture.

501
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,815
要找个好角度。
Gotta get a great angle here.

502
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,619
你可以…拍张照片。
You can... take the picture.

503
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:42,788
吻我
* Kiss me

504
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,957
*在吻蕨下面
* Underneath the kissin' fern

505
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,759
*宝贝
* Baby

506
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:50,762
*悬挂式植物
* The hanging plant

507
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:53,031
*悬挂式植物
* The hanging plant

508
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,233
*嘣嘣嘣
* Ba boom boom boom

509
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,069
*爱*粑粑粑粑嘣
* Of love  * Ba ba ba ba boom

510
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,740
接吻……
* The kissing...

511
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,788
你回家后会感觉好点的。
You'll feel better when you get home.

512
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,222
我们会打电话给克罗格医生。
We'll call Dr. Kroger.

513
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:19,959
这是星期六。
It's Saturday.

514
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,961
我们会打电话给克罗格医生。
We'll call Dr. Kroger.

515
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,265
娜塔莉，我见过他。
Natalie, I met him.

516
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,768
我跟他谈过了。
I talked to him.

517
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,069
他是如此真实。
He was so real.

518
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:35,775
我怎么能，我怎么能错得这么离谱?
How could I-- How could I be so wrong?

519
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,278
我这辈子都不会再喝酒了。
I'm never taking another drink as long as I live.

520
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:43,650
蒙先生，有些人就是没有忍耐力。
Mr. Monk, some people just have no tolerance.

521
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,952
我以前在酒吧工作。我一直都在看。
I used to work in a bar. I saw it all the time.

522
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,755
你只喝了两口。
You had two sips.

523
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:50,757
对一个正常人来说就相当于10枪。
That's like 10 shots to a normal person.

524
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,625
谢谢你！
Thank you.

525
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:54,125
嘿，伙计们，你们好吗?
Hey, folks, how you doing?

526
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,260
听着，我在找我弟弟。
Listen, I'm looking for my brother.

527
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:57,028
他失踪了。
He's gone missing.

528
00:24:57,063 --> 00:24:58,765
你见过他吗?
Have you seen him?

529
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:02,734
这是他!
That's him!

530
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:04,703
就是他!你认识他吗?
That's the guy! You know him?

531
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:07,272
我昨晚见过他!
I-I met him last night!

532
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:09,808
真的吗?
Really?

533
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,844
这是他!
That's him!

534
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,715
想跟我说说吗?
Wanna tell me about it?

535
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,821
我不知道他跟你说了什么。
I don't know what  he told you, you know.

536
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,757
他的真名叫本·格鲁伯。
His real name is Ben Gruber.

537
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,159
我们的母亲非常担心他。
Our mother's been worried sick about him.

538
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,728
感谢上帝!
Thank God!

539
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,762
我以为我疯了。
I thought I was losing my mind.

540
00:25:30,797 --> 00:25:31,631
我知道他喜欢酒
I knew he was into wine,

541
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,065
所以我查了所有的葡萄园
so I've been checking all the vineyards

542
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,933
还有附近的小旅馆。
and the little hotels in the area.

543
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:35,968
你是他哥哥?
And you're his brother?

544
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,703
艾伦，艾伦·格鲁伯。快乐。
Allen, Allen Gruber. Pleasure.

545
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:38,938
嗨，娜塔莉·缇哲。
Hi, Natalie Teeger.

546
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,740
我是艾德里安·蒙克。
This is Adrian Monk.

547
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:41,740
让我把话说清楚。
Let me  get this straight.

548
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:44,676
这里的每个人都假装从没见过他?
Everybody here is pretending they never met him?

549
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:45,711
每一个人。
Everyone.

550
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,680
哦……可怜的孩子。
Ohh...poor kid.

551
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,048
他肯定被吓死了
He's gotta be scared to death.

552
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,682
为什么?
Why?

553
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:54,252
他偷了一些钱。
He stole some money.

554
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,722
来自他工作的银行，对吗?
From a bank that he works for, right?

555
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:58,790
然后他就走了。
And he took off.

556
00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:00,660
我跟地方检察官谈过，她说，
I talked to the local D.A. and she said, you know,

557
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,729
如果他自首，他们会对他从轻发落。
they'd go easy on him if he turned himself in.

558
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:03,762
我就是为此而来的。
That's why I'm here.

559
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:05,632
我想，如果我去了，
I figured, you know, if I showed up,

560
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:06,633
也许我能找到他。
maybe I could find him.

561
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,734
也许我能说服他把钱还回去。
Maybe I could talk him into returning the money.

562
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,801
他拿走了多少?
How much did he take?

563
00:26:09,836 --> 00:26:11,170
310万美元。
$3.1 million.

564
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,771
唷。唷!
Whew. Whew!

565
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:15,741
不过听起来他已经花了一部分了。
Although it sounds like he's spending some of it already.

566
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:18,277
他一直在收买别人
He's been paying people off

567
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:20,378
说他们从没听说过他。
to say they've never heard of him.

568
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,749
你觉得他还在这里吗?
(Natalie)  You think he's still here?

569
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,785
我是说，他为什么要留下?
I mean, why would he stay?

570
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,787
他开的什么车?
What was he driving?

571
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,221
86年的别克。
'86 Buick, last I heard.

572
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:38,096
几率有多大?
What are the odds?

573
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,699
一辆86年的别克。
An '86 Buick.

574
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,032
不可能是他的。
Well, it can't be his.

575
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:42,734
这辆车一直在这里。
This car has been here forever.

576
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,002
嗯，我不这么认为。
Mmm, I don't think so.

577
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:46,806
这里有个凹痕，但没有生锈。
There's a dent here, but no rust.

578
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,741
轮孔里也没有生锈。
And there's no rust in the wheel wells.

579
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,711
这辆车来的时间不长。
This car hasn't been here long.

580
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,813
所以他还在这附近。
So he's still here somewhere.

581
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:55,781
他不在那栋房子里。
Well, he's not in that house.

582
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:59,218
我们称之为桶房。
And we call this the barrel room.

583
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,788
这些容器装满了60加仑
These containers are filled with 60 gallons

584
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,089
我们举世闻名的霞多丽酒。
of our world-famous Chardonnay.

585
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,657
它会在这些容器中老化
It's going to age in these containers

586
00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:07,794
整整11个月。
for exactly 11 months.

587
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,362
我喜欢把它看作是有生命的东西。
I like to think of it as a living thing.

588
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,731
就像一个婴儿在母亲的子宫里生长。
Like a baby growing inside a mother's womb.

589
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:14,333
格鲁伯先生!
Mr. Gruber!

590
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:15,768
我以为我们失去你了。
I thought we'd lost you.

591
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,304
哦,对不起。我只是回头了。
Oh, sorry. I just got turned around.

592
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,415
如果你跟着我，我们真的会
If you follow me, we're literally going to be

593
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:32,785
时光倒流。
stepping back in time.

594
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,286
踩酒，这是传统
Wine stomping-- it's a tradition

595
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,788
这要追溯到几千年前
that goes back thousands of years

596
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,455
希腊人。
to the Greeks.

597
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,991
我们是加州仅存的几个葡萄园之一
We're one of the last vineyards in California

598
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:43,762
至少他们的一些葡萄酒是用这种方法酿造的。
that at least makes some of their wine using this method.

599
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:51,002
哦，我的天啊。
(Monk)  Oh, my God.

600
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:52,838
人们真的会喝吗?
Do people actually drink that?

601
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:54,039
是的，我想是的。
Yeah, I think so.

602
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:55,273
他们疯了吗?
Are they insane?

603
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,143
去问问她他们是不是疯了。
Go, ask her if they're insane.

604
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,810
问问她就知道了。
Just ask her.

605
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,846
我不会问她的，蒙先生。
I'm not gonna ask her that, Mr. Monk.

606
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,115
当然我们不能把所有的酒都压成这样。
And of course we can't press all of our wine like this.

607
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:04,349
那太花时间了。
It would take too long.

608
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:07,318
但我们确实用这种方法做了一个标签。
But we do make one label using this method.

609
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,355
Allacco解百纳。啊!
The Allacco Cabernet. Aah!

610
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,390
可以在我们门口的商店买到。
It can be bought from our store out front.

611
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,497
赤霞珠。
Cabernet.

612
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:21,366
这酒我喝了15年了。
I've been drinking that wine for 15 years.

613
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,934
这是脚酒!
It's foot wine!

614
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,237
我能尝出来。
I can taste it.

615
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,205
噢,来吧!你尝不出来。
Oh...come on! You cannot taste it.

616
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:30,342
I-I-I即可。我现在都能尝到脚的味道了。
I-I-I can. I can taste the feet now.

617
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,344
我能尝到，还有脚趾。
I can taste-- and the toes.

618
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,913
还有脚趾之间的部分。
And what's between the toes.

619
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:35,781
还有真菌。
And the fungus.

620
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:36,548
这真的很野蛮。
It really is barbaric.

621
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,183
好吧，我没看到真菌。
Okay, I didn't see any fungus.

622
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,919
我相信他们的脚一定很干净。
Look, I'm sure they have clean feet.

623
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:42,822
这种事可能是有规定的。
There are probably rules about that stuff.

624
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:48,426
好吧，我承认。太恶心了。
Okay, I admit it. That's pretty disgusting.

625
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,996
看到后面有个自动售货机。
Saw a vending machine back there.

626
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,329
你要苏打水吗?
You want a soda?

627
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:52,498
原谅我吗?
Excuse me?

628
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,433
把你的嘴洗干净。你要苏打水吗?
To wash your mouth out. You want a soda?

629
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,336
那太好了。谢谢。
That would be great. Thanks.

630
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:01,773
我很幸运。
Tome su tiempo.

631
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:03,075
什么?
What?

632
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,845
意思是，“慢慢来。”
It means, "Take your time."

633
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,814
正确的。
Right.

634
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,515
(低语)娜塔莉。
[whispering] Natalie.

635
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:11,851
娜塔莉，他在撒谎。
Natalie, he's lying.

636
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:14,353
这个人和我昨晚遇到的那个人
This guy and the man I met last night

637
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:16,255
我们不是兄弟。
are not brothers.

638
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:17,522
他只说了“苏打水”。
He just said "soda."

639
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:19,959
还有兹威贝尔，格鲁伯，不管他叫什么
And Zwibell, Gruber, or whatever his name is

640
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,794
说“流行”。
said "pop."

641
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:22,661
他会两种语言。
And he was bilingual.

642
00:29:22,693 --> 00:29:24,430
这家伙一句西班牙语都不会说。
This guy doesn't speak a word of Spanish.

643
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,565
他们不可能在同一所房子里长大。
They could not have grown up in the same house.

644
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:30,368
好吧，我得弄清楚他到底是谁。
Okay, I need to find out who he really is.

645
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,306
听……你能撬开他的车吗?
Listen...can you break into his car?

646
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,574
我能撬开他的车吗?
Can I break into his car?

647
00:29:35,606 --> 00:29:37,476
是的，我会。好的。
Yes, I can. Okay.

648
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,244
我会让他忙起来的。我带他去酒吧。
I'll keep him busy. I'll take him to the bar.

649
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,881
试着把他灌醉。让他放松。
Try to get him drunk. Loosen him up.

650
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,249
也许他会犯错误。
Maybe he'll make a misstep.

651
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,516
等等，等等，等等。你要喝酒?
Wait, wait, wait. You're gonna drink?

652
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,919
别担心。我知道我在做什么。
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

653
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:51,022
嗨。
Hi.

654
00:29:51,057 --> 00:29:53,025
我和我朋友坐在那边。
I'm sitting with my friend over there.

655
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,559
他想要一瓶你们家的白葡萄酒。
He would like a bottle of your house white.

656
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:55,961
好的。
Okay.

657
00:29:55,994 --> 00:30:00,231
还有，你们有无酒精的葡萄酒吗?
And, uh, do you have any non-alcoholic wine?

658
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:03,568
我们有非常好的红葡萄酒。零酒精。
We have a very nice Claret. Zero alcohol.

659
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:05,503
一点酒都没有
No alcohol at all.

660
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:06,538
我就是这么说的。
That's what I said.

661
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,039
我要那个。
I'll have that.

662
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:10,041
你能把它放在玻璃瓶里吗?
Could you put it in a carafe?

663
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:11,509
啊哈。你不用带瓶子。
Uh-huh. You don't have to bring the bottle.

664
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:14,445
你说对了。我们会拿给您的。
You got it. We'll bring it over to you.

665
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,383
(硬币叮当声)
[coin clinks]

666
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,218
12号桌要一瓶精选白葡萄酒。
Table twelve needs a bottle of the house white.

667
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,488
再来一瓶波尔多红酒。
And a carafe of that Claret.

668
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,022
你说对了。
You got it.

669
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,424
给你。
Here you go.

670
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,594
谢谢你！
Thank you.

671
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:31,998
我真的很感激你……这么感兴趣…
I do appreciate you... taking such an interest...

672
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,065
阿蒙先生。
Mr. Monk.

673
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:35,500
好吧，我也有个哥哥。
Oh, well, I have a brother too.

674
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:36,634
我会担心死的
I'd be worried sick

675
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:39,471
如果他出了什么事。
if anything happened to him.

676
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,343
所以…敬你哥哥。
So...to your brother.

677
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,412
不管他在哪里。
Wherever the hell he is.

678
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,291
口渴的男孩。
Thirsty boy.

679
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:03,362
有本事就来抓我。
Catch me if you can.

680
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,401
你有很多朋友吗?
Do you have  a lot of friends?

681
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,070
我敢打赌你会的。
I'll bet you do.

682
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:14,640
有时我…
Sometimes I...

683
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:16,474
打开电视。
turn on the TV.

684
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:19,144
然后我把声音调小…
And I turn the sound way down...

685
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:24,682
和…我假装他们在跟我说话。
And...I pretend that they're talking to me.

686
00:31:24,715 --> 00:31:26,952
每个人都喜欢我。
And everybody likes me.

687
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,522
”阿德里安。欢迎回来。
"Adrian. Welcome back.

688
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,491
“哦，我们很高兴见到你。
"Oh, we're so happy to see you.

689
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:36,162
我们很高兴见到你。”
We are so happy to see you."

690
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:40,898
我打赌你有很多朋友。
I'll bet you have a lot of friends.

691
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:51,242
你看起来像驼鹿。
You look like a moose.

692
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:52,644
(笑)你有。
[laughs] You do.

693
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:54,546
我会给你打电话的
I'm gonna call you

694
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:59,218
像麋鹿一样的卢克先生。
Mr. Luke Like-a-Moose.

695
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,388
(笑)Luke like a moose。
[laughing] Luke Like-a-Moose.

696
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,557
那么，关于你哥哥…
So, about your brother...

697
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,993
驼鹿的事我很抱歉…
I'm sorry about the moose thing...

698
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:09,528
嘿!
Hey!

699
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,662
(银器卡嗒卡嗒响)
[silverware clattering]

700
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,097
这是什么歌?
What song is this?

701
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:20,939
(吹口哨)
[whistling]

702
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,461
史托图梅耶上尉，拜托。这很重要。
Captain Stottlemeyer, please. It's important.

703
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:45,530
也许你已经受够了，蒙先生。
Maybe you've had enough, Mr. Monk.

704
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,766
不。不，不，不。
No. No, no, no, no.

705
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:50,336
嗯…我很好。
Um...I'm fine.

706
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,171
我很好。(叹息)
I'm fine. [groans]

707
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:54,173
这不是很棒吗?
Isn't this great?

708
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:57,643
只是几个人坐在旋转餐厅里。
Just a couple of guys sitting in a revolving restaurant.

709
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,711
啊，我喜欢。
Ah, I love that.

710
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,613
嘿,上气不接下气。
[breathless] Hey.

711
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,648
蒙先生，我能跟你谈谈吗
Mr. Monk, could I just talk to you for a second

712
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:05,784
在私人吗?
in private?

713
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,553
[娜塔莉假装笑]
[Natalie feigning laughter]

714
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:09,654
就是这样。
That's it.

715
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:11,789
[蒙克歇斯底里地笑]
[Monk laughing hysterically]

716
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,424
加油，加油，加油，加油。
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

717
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:16,362
(笑)来吧。
[laughing] Come on.

718
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,563
你喝醉了!
You're drunk!

719
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:21,299
(笑)不，它不含酒精。
[laughing] No, it's non-alcoholic.

720
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,036
(阿蒙笑)
[Monk laughing]

721
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:25,371
他就在我想要的地方!
I got him right where I want him!

722
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,472
看！我眨眼。
Look! I'm winking.

723
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:30,675
蒙先生，听我说!
Okay, Mr. Monk, listen to me!

724
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,278
你说得对，他不叫格鲁伯。
You were right-- his name isn't Gruber.

725
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,612
我是小艾尔·尼科莱托。
It's Al Nicoletto, Jr.

726
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:35,413
他被逮捕过五次，没有被定罪。
He has five arrests, no convictions.

727
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:37,048
听着，他是个职业杀手。
Look, he's a contract killer.

728
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:39,417
艾尔，这是真的吗?
Al, is this true?

729
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:46,657
是或不是，这是真的吗?
Yes or no, is this true?

730
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,164
我已经报警了!
(Natalie) I already called the police!

731
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:55,166
他们在路上了，别做傻事。
They're on their way, so don't do anything stupid.

732
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:56,468
(尼科莱托)别做傻事。
(Nicoletto) Don't you do anything stupid.

733
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,304
所以大家都同意了!
And so it is agreed!

734
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,239
让这句话传出去
And let the word go forth

735
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:02,473
没有人会做傻事。
that nobody will do anything stupid.

736
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:04,143
走吧，走吧。你在做什么?
Let's go, let's go. What are you doing?

737
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:05,310
哦，你以后会感谢我的。
Oh, you'll thank me later.

738
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:06,778
忘掉瓶子吧!
Forget the bottle!

739
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,746
啊!
Ahh!

740
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,382
主要研究!
Unh!

741
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:12,083
啊!蒙先生，打他!
Uhh! Mr. Monk, hit him!

742
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:13,152
与什么?
With what?

743
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,652
啊!瓶子!
Aah! The bottle!

744
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:16,255
哪一个?
Which one?

745
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,824
(咕哝着)没关系!
[grunting] It doesn't matter!

746
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,367
(普通员工)
[grunts]

747
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,835
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

748
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,139
我差点心脏病发作。
I almost had a heart attack.

749
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:34,806
哦,上帝。
Oh, God.

750
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,376
心脏病发作。
Heart attack.

751
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,677
是的，我得说他很重要。
(Stottlemeyer)  Yeah, I'd say he's  pretty important.

752
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,215
联调局派了一架私人飞机去接他。
The feds are sending  a private plane to pick him up.

753
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,849
这是9毫米。
It's 9mm.

754
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,585
本·格鲁伯的搭档被发现中枪身亡
Ben Gruber's partner was found shot to death

755
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,221
在纽约的酒店房间里
in his hotel room in New York City

756
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:50,755
五天前。
five days ago.

757
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:53,858
我打赌这些子弹和这把枪吻合。
Now, I'm betting that those bullets match this gun.

758
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,760
他们抓住他了。
They got him.

759
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:58,630
看着联调局把功劳都占了。
Watch the feds take all the credit.

760
00:34:58,664 --> 00:34:59,764
队长……
Captain...

761
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,900
你得看看这个。
You have got to see this.

762
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:04,835
蒙克在里面做加法呢。
Monk's in there doing one of his summation things.

763
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,172
他浪费了。
He's wasted.

764
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:11,342
当我听到…当我听到…
When I hear--when I heard N-n-nat'lie...

765
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,679
比如说她差点心脏病发作…

766
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:17,583
我记得——我记得

女士们，先生们，

利兰·斯托特梅尔上尉。

杀人!

774
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,168
给他们看看你的警徽。
Show--show 'em your badge.

775
00:35:36,202 --> 00:35:38,536
表现出来。给他们看看——给他们看看。

表现出来。阿蒙,

777
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:41,507
我破了这个案子。
I solved the case.

778
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:42,608
很好。好，好，好。
Good. Good, good, good.

779
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,643
让我们,嗯……

780
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:47,278
让这些人回房间去，好吗?
Let's let these people go up to their rooms, okay?

781
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:48,813
你的枪呢?
Where's your gun?

782
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:51,483
他有枪。
He's got a gun.

783
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,418
好的。哦,不!不，不，不，不!

786

787
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:01,793
他们都参与其中。
They're all in on it.

788
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,228
(施托图梅尔)那么，他们做了什么?
(Stottlemeyer) Well, what did they do?

789
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:05,264
嗯，他们——看看他们!

哦，看看他们!好的。好的。

792
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:13,804
他们可能看起来不像冷血杀手，
They may not look like cold-blooded killers,

793
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,842
但是他们，呃…哦……

蒙先生!
[gasps] Mr. Monk!

800

我们需要一辆大囚车。

803
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:41,266
他们还有…水稻马车?

804
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,833
给你，蒙先生。

我十点左右上床睡觉。

他们还在打扑克。

815
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:09,795
古柏肯定需要更多的钱

816

于是他上楼去拿。

我十点左右上床睡觉。

我也爱你，阿蒙。

00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:43,961
你……

00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,065
我们去睡一觉吧。
Let's go sleep it off.

832
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,603
谢谢，谢谢，谢谢你…

00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:58,443
[笑]
[chuckles]

837
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,445
好了，过来。过来一下。
All right, come here. Come here a minute.

838
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:01,980
我要给自己买一个。上床睡觉。
I'm gonna get me one. Up to bed.

839
00:38:02,012 --> 00:38:04,014
他——!
Well, he--!

840
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:12,423
他再也没回来。
Well, he never  came back.

841
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:15,893
他们很担心，决定上楼去
They got worried and decided  to go upstairs

842
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,429
去看看他!

843
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:20,666
他们发现本·格鲁伯死了。

他死于…心脏病发作。

还有现金，310万美元。

847
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:35,614
这就是人们想要的钱。
That's the kind of money  people come looking for.

848
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,916
怎么办呢?怎么办呢?
What to do?  What to do?

849
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:42,119
他们决定把尸体藏起来
They decided  to hide the body

850
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:44,356
把钱分了!
and split the money!

851
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:47,425
如果有人问起，他们就会假装
If anybody asked,  they were going to pretend

852
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:48,994
他们从未听说过他。
they never heard of him.

853
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:52,931
等一等。
Hold on.

854
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:59,438
啊。(嗅探)
Uhh. [sniffs]

855
00:39:00,606 --> 00:39:01,907
事情是这样的。
Here's what happened.

856
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,710
他们处理掉了格鲁伯的车。
They got rid  of Gruber's car.

857
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:09,914
他们去掉了他的签名
They removed his signature

858
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:11,882
来自留言簿
from the guest book

859
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,519
然后在没有他的情况下重新拍了一张合影。
and retook  the group photo without him.

860
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:16,922
他走了。
He was gone.

861
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,625
就像他从未存在过一样。
It was like  he never existed.

862
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,793
像幽灵一样消失了。
Gone like a ghost.

863
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:24,929
你找到钱了吗?
Did you find the money?

864
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,532
还没有。
Not yet.

865
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:27,998
他说这是一个阴谋
He says there was  a conspiracy,

866
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,067
我们都拿了钱。
and we all took the money.

867
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:33,838
我说格鲁伯这个人把自己的车扔了，
I say this character Gruber junked his own car,

868
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,407
拿走了现金，
took the cash,

869
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,443
搭便车去了墨西哥
and hitchhiked to Mexico.

870
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:39,577
你能证明我是错的吗?
Can you prove I'm wrong?

871
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,480
没有。他是对的。
Nope. He's right.

872
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:45,050
没有尸体，我们就没法立案。
Without a body, we don't have a case.

873
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,452
阿蒙……
Monk...

874
00:39:46,485 --> 00:39:47,452
(轻声打鼾)
[snoring softly]

875
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:48,454
阿蒙!
Monk!

876
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:50,155
(叹息)
[sighs]

877
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:52,590
好吧,嗯……
Okay, um...

878
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:54,192
我想你们都可以走了。
I guess you're all free to go.

879
00:39:54,224 --> 00:39:56,494
中尉，记下所有人的地址。
Lieutenant, take everybody's address.

880
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:57,963
确保证件有效
Make sure it's a valid I.D.

881
00:39:57,996 --> 00:39:59,030
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

882
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,431
请大家跟我来。
If everybody can just follow me.

883
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:03,902
很抱歉给您带来不便。
We're sorry about  the inconvenience.

884
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,436
天啊，这是什么?
God, what is it?

885
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:06,572
什么是什么?
What is what?

886
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:07,639
这是他们的新酒。
This is  their new wine.

887
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:08,907
他们在隔壁装瓶。
They bottle it  next door.

888
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,976
但是它有这个…怪异的回味，
But it has this... funky, weird aftertaste,

889
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,777
我也说不清是什么原因
and I cannot put my finger on it.

890
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:14,846
在这里。
Here.

891
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,614
(嗅探)
[sniffs]

892
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:19,451
闻起来像水Velva。
Smells like Aqua Velva.

893
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:22,052
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

894
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,889
哦，天哪!
Oh, my God!

895
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,891
这是Aqua Velva。
It's Aqua Velva.

896
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,460
这是Aqua Velva。
It's Aqua Velva.

897
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:49,880
(皮埃尔)这是你夫人的主意!
(Pierre) It was your lady's idea!

898
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:52,717
这不是我的主意!
It wasn't my idea!

899
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:55,219
不,不!打电话给法国领事馆!
No, no! Call the French Consulate!

900
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,588
不,不!
No, no!

901
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:00,958
嗯，他是个真正的派对动物。
(Stottlemeyer) Well, he's a real party animal.

902
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:02,628
[笑]
[chuckles]

903
00:41:02,661 --> 00:41:04,530
好吧……
Okay...

904
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:06,731
小心驾驶，娜塔莉。
You drive safely, Natalie.

905
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:08,199
我们在校园里见。
We'll see you around campus.

906
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:09,967
好的，谢谢你，上尉。我会的。
Okay, thank you, Captain. I will.

907
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:16,742
周年快乐，艾德里安。
Happy Anniversary, Adrian.

908
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:19,644
对不起，我不相信你。
Sorry I didn't believe you.

909
00:41:22,748 --> 00:41:24,815
(发动机启动)
[engine starts]
