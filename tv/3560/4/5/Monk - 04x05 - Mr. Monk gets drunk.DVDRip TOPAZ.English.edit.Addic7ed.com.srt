to be for three days.

for three days.

Adrian solved the case in...
What was it, 12 minutes?

96
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:17,238
L-I knew that the general's daughter
was lying about meeting Churchill,

97
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,211
because Churchill
wasn't knighted till 1953.

98
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,943
Which meant that Reginald,
the limping chauffeur who supplied
her alibi, was also lying.

99
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:28,953
So obviously, they were lovers
who were planning to kill the sultan...

100
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:33,754
and steal the Arabian emerald.
Anyway, uh, we had to refund
everybody's money.

00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,443
Well, that's-that's nice.
Ah, please.

151
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,457
Mmm. Ah.

152
00:09:57,063 --> 00:10:00,829
Yours is even better. Much better.
All right, let's do it.
Pass it down.

153
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,334
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

154
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:07,270
Oh, transcendent.
Like a meal in itself.

155
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:13,672
Ah, just think, a week ago
I couldn't even afford a bottle of pop.

156
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,910
Oh, fabulous.
[Chuckles]

157
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,111
Hey, are you all right?

158
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,781
Not much of a drinker.

159
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:27,223
Oh.
[Laughs]
How many have you had?

160
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,227
One bottle?
One sip.

161
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:33,527
Oh. Well, if you wake up tomorrow
and you're still hammered,
you gotta come find me.

162
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,124
I'm in Room 202,
by the back staircase.

163
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,137
I got a great cure for a hangover.
It's 100% guaranteed.

164
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,833
<i>[Woman] I'm still in.</i>
<i>[Man] It's the psychiatrist</i>
<i>you know so much of.</i>

165
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,138
Um... So, um,
if you'll excuse me,

166
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:49,580
I'm, uh, going to teach these rubes
how to play some cards.
[Laughs]

167
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,880
Nice knowin' ya. Hello.
Hello, everybody. Hi.

168
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,352
Hello.
So, uh, what are
you playing?

169
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,355
It's a friendly little game.

170
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,516
Oh. I thought you were
playing poker.

171
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,026
[Laughs]
Hey, is this seat taken?

172
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,858
No. Go ahead. Sit down.
Ah. Thank you.

173
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,593
[Coughing]
I'm sorry. You know what?
That's probably the Aqua Velva.

174
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,693
Oh, my God. What did you do,
take a bath in it?

175
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,171
No, I didn't,
but that's not a bad idea.
I'll try it next time.

176
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,174
Hey, Larry Zwibell.
Hey.

177
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,541
Hi. I brought a couple friends
with me. Maybe you'd all
like to say hi.

178
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,672
Oh.
Ah.
[Laughs]

179
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,943
- Pierre LaCoste.
- Ah, <i>bonjour,</i> Pierre.

180
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,951
<i>Bonjour.</i>
Cal Gefsky. Hi.
How you doing?

181
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,146
This is my wife, Heidi.
Heidi.

182
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:32,520
Wife? I just can't
get used to that.

183
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,754
- Oh, we just got married on Saturday.
- <i>[Larry] Congratulations.</i>

184
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,353
Oh, I'm Dr. David Sobin.
Nice to see you.

185
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,490
He's a psychiatrist, you know,
so watch out for him.

186
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,761
A shrink? No, you're kidding.
Wait, hold on.

187
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,769
I got a great joke. Okay,
have you guys heard this one?

188
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:49,638
A guy goes to a psychiatrist,
and he says, "Doctor, my wife
thinks she's a refrigerator."

189
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,406
<i>And-And the psychiatrist says,</i>
<i>"Well, just ignore her. '"</i>
<i>And the guy says, "I can't.</i>

190
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,744
When she sleeps with her mouth open,
the little light keeps me awake all night."

191
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,808
[Laughing]
The little light.

192
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,786
Hey, Adrian. What,
are you gonna give up?
Uh, I think so.

193
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,915
Good night.
Oh, excuse me.
Um, excuse me.

194
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,585
Um, before you go,
would you take our picture?
Uh, sure.

195
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,061
Oh. Oh, good idea.
Okay.

196
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,432
Oh, oh.

197
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,438
Hold still.
Hold-Hold still.

198
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:24,101
Ready. Smile.

199
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:27,577
Wait. Let-Let's stand
oldest to youngest.

200
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,774
So that would be you,
then you, then you.
Mr. Monk.

201
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,841
I will take the picture.

202
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,990
[Beeps]
[Shutter Clicks]

203
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,835
<i>Oh, Mr. Monk.</i>
<i>I was just coming to get you.</i>

204
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,743
Shh.
It's a beautiful day. They have
an amazing breakfast downstairs.

205
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,804
Shh.

206
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,514
Are you okay?
Mmm.

207
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:15,284
Were you drinking?
Just a little.
Not even a glass.

208
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,554
[Groans]
Oh.

209
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:23,193
Oh, I met a guy. He's in 202.
He said he had a cure for this.

210
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:27,296
Uh, he said it was...
He said it was guaranteed.

211
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,035
Well, here. 202.
202.

212
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,148
Larry? It's-It's Adrian
from last night.

213
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,151
Hello?

214
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,416
Oh, sorry.
L-I was looking for Larry.

215
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,822
Huh?
Ah, did you switch rooms?

216
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,917
No, no.

217
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,293
Well, he said 202,
at the back.

218
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,355
Well, who-who-who are you
talking about?

219
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,362
Larry... Larry Zwibell,

220
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:02,271
uh, from last night.

221
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,708
You played poker with him?
Uh, no, no, you're mistaken.

222
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:10,511
You see, I don't know
anybody by this name.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

223
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:15,418
Oh, good morning.
I hope you're hungry.
Hi, good morning.

224
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,047
Uh, we're looking for a guest...
a Larry Zwibell?

225
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:22,719
Uh, who?
He checked in last night.
You remember? Room 202.

226
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,458
Adrian, nobody checked in yesterday
except for you and Natalie.

227
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,195
No. No, no, no.
Sylvia, I talked to him.

228
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,999
He-He... Larry Zwibell.

229
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,472
Uh, see for yourself.

230
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:46,481
He was here.
I talked to him.

231
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,918
You have to believe me.

232
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,549
Okay.

233
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,017
There are three cars
in the parking lot, plus mine.

234
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,749
The same three cars
that were there last night.
Maybe he left.

235
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,451
That wouldn't explain
why everybody's lying.

236
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,960
Then why didn't
he check in?
He did check in.

237
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,021
He said Room 202. Look.

238
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,659
We signed in on the bottom
of this page.

239
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:40,398
Sylvia could have removed
the next page.

240
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,736
Why would she do that,
Mr. Monk?

241
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,135
I don't know.

242
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,873
Something happened.

243
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,610
Something happened here.

244
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:56,144
Come on. Are you sure
you only had one drink?

245
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:04,385
Natalie, I met him.

246
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,099
He-He spoke Spanish,

247
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:12,831
and he reeked of... Aqua Velva.

248
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,232
You believe me, right?

249
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:26,308
You said we have to believe each other.
You said that was the rule.

250
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,821
That's true. That's true.

251
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,556
[Clears Throat]
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to bother you all,

252
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:42,998
but we're looking for a guest,
Larry Zwibell.

253
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,696
He was here last night.
Uh, who?

254
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,739
[Laughs]
I told you I never heard of him.

255
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,536
He played poker with you.

256
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,374
He told you that joke
about the psychiatrist.

257
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:57,040
<i>The wife who thinks</i>
<i>she's a refrigerator.</i>

258
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,710
And the psychiatrist says,
"Just ignore it."

259
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:03,881
But the man says, "I can't,
because when she sleeps
with her mouth open,

260
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,789
the little light inside her mouth
keeps me awake."

261
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,884
[All Laughing]
That's brilliant.

262
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,328
Why-Why are you laughing?
Because it's funny.

263
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:16,698
B-B-But you already heard it.
You heard it last night.

264
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,599
They already heard it.
Maybe it's your delivery.

265
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:27,008
[Sighs] Did you notice
the French guy did this?

266
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,515
That's his tell. I was watching him
play poker last night.

267
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,608
Whenever he bluffed,
he rubbed his nose.

268
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:37,416
I'm telling you.
He did it upstairs earlier too.

269
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,423
He's lying. They are all lying.

270
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,925
It's... It's a conspiracy.

271
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,929
Mr. Monk, why?

272
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,158
They don't even know each other.

273
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,895
Ah, Ricardo.
<i>Senor?</i>

274
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,765
Ricardo, you remember
my friend?

275
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,937
He... He was sitting with me
at that table right there.

276
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,948
He spoke Spanish to you.
He ordered the Degout pinot.

277
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,576
I am sorry, <i>senor.</i>

278
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,086
There was no one there.
You were alone all night.

279
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,349
Ricardo.
Excuse me.

280
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,094
Well, you're gettin'
an early start.
[Laughs]

281
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,601
The tasting doesn't begin
until noon.

282
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,661
May I?

283
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,002
Oh, they make this here.

284
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:32,134
Mmm. They just released it
this morning.

285
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:35,203
How is it?
It's good.
It's, uh... It's sweet.

286
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,979
But it has a, um...
has a weird aftertaste to it.
Ahh.

287
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:44,079
Do you taste it?
Mmm, no, not really.

288
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,647
I'm a little bit worried
about your friend.

289
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:51,321
I'm a psychiatrist,
and I saw him yesterday
talking to an empty chair.

290
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:55,560
Oh, yeah, he does that.
His wife died eight years ago.
He talks to her.

291
00:18:55,634 --> 00:19:00,094
Mrs. Willis said
he used to be a detective.
He was discharged.

292
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,572
May I ask, why is he here?

293
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,634
Well, it's his anniversary,
and they honeymooned here, so...

294
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:12,378
So, this is probably a...
time of stress for him?

295
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,419
Does he handle stress well?

296
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,647
No. He handles stress unwell.

297
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:22,627
Lonely, uh, children, uh, will sometimes
make up a person in their minds...

298
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:26,061
an imaginary friend,
if you will.

299
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:29,589
I've seen it a lot in my practice.
I've seen adults do it too.

300
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,762
Well, you don't know Adrian Monk.
He's a great detective.

301
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,602
The police don't make a move
without talking to him first.

302
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,869
Now, I don't know
what's going on here,

303
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:43,472
but if he says he met a man
named Larry Zwibell, then he met
a man named Larry Zwibell.

304
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,217
Oh, this is interesting.

305
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,349
There's nothing upstairs.

306
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,359
What's going on?

307
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:59,454
Uh, excuse me.

308
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:09,567
- <i>[Natalie]</i>
<i>What do you think?</i>
- About what?

309
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,632
The signature.

310
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,003
The painter.

311
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,538
He has the same name as...
As my hallucination?

312
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,847
Hey, I didn't say that.

313
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:25,253
But, Mr. Monk, you gotta admit
it looks kind of bad.

314
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:31,285
People might think
that you saw the name...

315
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,388
and made up a person.

316
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:40,735
Or the man I met...

317
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,434
saw the name on that painting...

318
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:46,341
and decided to use it for himself.

319
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,019
The camera.

320
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,385
Natalie, they took a photo
last night...

321
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,089
a-a-a group photo...
and he was in it.
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

322
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:08,030
And this is our 2002
cabernet sauvignon.

323
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,265
I think you'll like it.
It's slightly softer and more tannic
than the merlot.

324
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,305
You've got to get
that camera.
Okay.

325
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,676
All right, but you stay here.

326
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,681
Ah. Will you be joining us?
Yes.

327
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,047
Good. The more the merrier.
Thank you.

328
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,518
Next we're going to try
the Syrah.

329
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:32,887
<i>Now, the Syrah comes</i>
<i>from our very own grapes</i>
<i>in the east vineyard.</i>

330
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,827
What are you drinking?

331
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:40,456
Uh, it's the, uh...
the Sierra Springs.

332
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,023
How is it?
It's exquisite.

333
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:47,367
Is this your first wine tasting?

334
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:51,068
I'll explain what they're doing.
There are five steps.
We call them the "Five S's"...

335
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,304
Mm-hmm.
See, swirl, sniff, sip and spit.

336
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:57,644
Now, they're on step one.
How does the wine look?

337
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,946
Is it rich in color?
Does it react with the light?

338
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,816
Excuse me.
Uh, what was that last one,

339
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,857
uh, step five?
Spit.

340
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:10,827
So, they're-they're-they're
going to be spitting?
That's it.

341
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:14,662
Mmm. Here. I can hold
your camera for you.
Oh, I'm good.

342
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,395
- <i>Now they're on step three.</i>
- Oh, step three.

343
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,267
Sniffing. You smell the wine.
Inhale deeply.

344
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,273
Do you smell the fruit
or the herbs?

345
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,038
Uh, so that means, really,
there's only two steps left
until the spitting.

346
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:29,603
That's right.
Uh, all-all at once?

347
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:34,914
All of them spitting on the...
on the porch here, uh,
with me on-on the porch?

348
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:38,922
- <i>Now they're sipping.</i>
- Sipping? So spitting is next.
Oh, God.

349
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,185
<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>Oh, here it comes.</i>

00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,767
How about a group shot?
A little newlywed group shot.
Um...

355
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,070
I'll take it.
No. Maybe later.

356
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:02,406
Oh, my God.
It's a kissing fern.

357
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,279
A what?
Yeah. They're called
kissing ferns.

358
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,911
It's supposed to be good luck
for newlyweds to kiss underneath one.

359
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:13,617
Have you heard that song?
"Kiss Me Under the Kissing Fern, Baby"?

360
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,660
Mmm.
Yeah, yeah.

I talked to him.

How could l...
How could I be so wrong?

I'm never taking another drink
as long as I live.

00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,478
Mr. Monk, some people
just have no tolerance.

384
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:45,607
I used to work in a bar.
I saw it all the time.

385
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:50,951
You had two sips. That's like 10 shots
to a normal person.
Thank you.

00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,956
Hey, folks. How you doin'?

387
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:55,322
Listen, I'm lookin' for my brother.
He's gone missing.

388
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,327
Have you seen him?

389
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,328
That's him!

390
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,492
That's the guy!
You know him?

391
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:06,036
L-I met him last night.

392
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:10,404
- Really?
- That's him.

393
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,903
Wanna tell me about it?

394
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:23,347
I don't know what he told you, you know.
His real name is Ben Gruber.

395
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:25,355
Our mother's been
worried sick about him.

396
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:28,756
Thank God. I thought
I was losing my mind.

397
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,057
I knew he was into wine,
so I've been checkin' all the vineyards...

398
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:34,189
- and the little hotels in the area.
- And you're his brother?

399
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:37,201
- Allen. Allen Gruber. Pleasure.
- Hi. Natalie Teeger.

400
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,793
Natalie.
<i>This is Adrian Monk.</i>

401
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,966
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>
<i>Everybody here is pretending</i>
<i>they never met him?</i>

402
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,272
Everyone.
Aw, poor kid.

403
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,710
- He's gotta be scared to death.
- Why?

404
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:54,816
He stole some money from a bank
that he works for, right?

405
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,820
And he took off.

406
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,585
I talked to the local D.A., and she said,
you know, they'd go easy on him
if he turned himself in.

407
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,719
That's why I'm here.
I figured, you know, if I showed up,

408
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,787
maybe I could find him,
maybe I could talk him into
returning the money.

409
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,924
- How much did he take?
- $3.1 million.

410
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,934
Whew.
[Exhales]

411
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:14,165
Although it sounds like
he's spending some of it already.

412
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:18,608
He's been paying people off
to say they've never heard of him.

413
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,975
<i>Do you think he's still here?</i>

414
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,037
I mean, why would he stay?

415
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:28,417
What was he driving?
'86 Buick, last I heard.

416
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,858
What are the odds?
An '86 Buick.

417
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:42,263
Well, it can't be his.
This car has been here forever.
Mmm, I don't think so.

418
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:45,667
There's a dent here,
but no rust.

419
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,932
And there's no rust
in the wheel wells.

420
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,133
This car hasn't been here long.

421
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:54,042
So he's still here
somewhere, right?
Well, he's not in that house.

422
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,673
And we call this
the barrel room.

423
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:02,277
These containers are filled
with 60 gallons of our
world-famous chardonnay.

424
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:05,812
It's gonna age in these containers
for exactly 11 months.

425
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:10,759
I like to think of it as a living thing,
like a baby growing inside
a mother's womb.

426
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,798
Mr. Gruber.
I thought we'd lost you.

427
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:16,527
Oh, sorry.
I just got turned around.

428
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:30,006
If you follow me,
we're literally going to be
stepping back in time.

429
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:35,542
Wine stomping. It's a tradition
that goes back thousands of years
to the Greeks.

430
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:41,581
We're one of the last vineyards in California
that at least make some of their wine
using this method.

431
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,232
<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

432
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,133
Do people actually
drink that?
Yeah, I think so.

433
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:55,366
Are they insane?
Go ask her if they're insane.

434
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,932
J-Just ask her.
I'm not gonna ask her that,
Mr. Monk.

435
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,411
And of course, we can't press
all of our wine like this.
It would take too long.

436
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,540
But we do make one label
using this method,

437
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,585
the Allacco Cabernet.
[Yelps]

438
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:10,246
It can be bought from
our store out front.

439
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,551
Uh...
[Gags]

440
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:17,425
<i>I can't believe that's the Allacco Cabernet.</i>
<i>[Natalie]</i>
<i>I know. Just take it easy.</i>

441
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:21,056
I've been drinking that wine

I can taste it.
Oh, well, come on.
You cannot taste it.

L-l-I can.
I can taste the feet now.

What's between the toe...

445
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,911
And the fungus.
It really is barbaric.

446
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:38,312
Okay, I didn't see any fungus.
Look, I'm sure they have clean feet.

Listen, can you break into
his car?

464
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,698
Can I break into his car?
Yes, I can.
Okay.

465
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,039
I'll keep him busy.
I'll take him to the bar.
I'll try to get him drunk.

466
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,408

Maybe he'll make a misstep.

Okay.

And, uh, do you have
any nonalcoholic wine?

472
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:02,021
We have a very nice claret.
Zero alcohol.

No alcohol at all?
That's what I said.

474
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:08,236
I'll have that.
Could you put it in a carafe?

475
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:12,709
Uh, you don't have to bring the bottle.
You got it.
We'll bring it over to you.

You...

Okay. Let's go sleep it off,
all right?

593
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,929
Thank-Thank-Thanks for the...

594
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:52,095
What?
Thanks for the...
Look at that.

595
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:55,036
What's that thing?
[Laughs]

596
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,040
All right, come here.
Come here. Come here.

597
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,099
I'm gonna get me one.
Up to bed.

598
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,167
Oh, w-wait!

599
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:09,718
<i>See, Gruber never came back.</i>

600
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:14,281
<i>They got worried</i>

<i>They found Ben Gruber dead.</i>

602
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:20,526
<i>He was dead from a heart attack.</i>

603
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:25,797
<i>And cash</i>... <i>$3. 1 million.</i>

<i>That's the kind of money</i>
<i>people come lookin'for.</i>

00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:35,971
<i>What to do? What to do?</i>

607
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:40,779
<i>Well, they decided to hide the body</i>
<i>and split the money.</i>

608
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:44,787
<i>If anybody asked,</i>
<i>they were gonna pretend</i>
<i>they never heard ofhim.</i>

609
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:50,717
Hold on.

610
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:58,860
[Sighs, Sniffs]
Here's what happened.

611
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:02,531
If we don't take the money...
[Continues, Indistinct]
<i>They got rid of Gruber's car.</i>

612
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:06,770
<i>Then they removed the page</i>
<i>with his signature...</i>

613
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,937
<i>from the guest book.</i>

614
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,278
<i>And retook the group photo</i>
<i>without him.</i>

615
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:16,377
<i>He was gone.</i>
<i>It was like he never existed.</i>

616
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,684
<i>[Shutter Clicks]</i>
<i>Gone like a ghost.</i>

617
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:23,226
- Did you find the money?
- Not yet.

618
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:26,092
<i>He says there was a conspiracy,</i>
<i>and we all took the money.</i>

619
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:30,998
I say this character Gruber
junked his own car,

620
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:34,094
took the cash,
and hitchhiked to Mexico.

621
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:37,436
Can you prove
I'm wrong?
Nope.

622
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:40,136
He's right. Without a body,
we don't have a case.

623
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,145
<i>[Snoring]</i>
Monk?

624
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,381
Monk.

625
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,474
[Snoring Continues]

626
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:51,612
Okay, um, I guess
you're all free to go.

627
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,886
Lieutenant, take everybody's address.
Make sure it's a valid I.D.

628
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:58,918
Yes, sir. Uh, if everybody could
just follow me. We're sorry
about the inconvenience.

629
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,298
[Sighs]
What is it?

630
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:05,699
What is what?
<i>This is their new wine.</i>
<i>They bottle it next door.</i>

631
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,706
But it has this funky, weird aftertaste,
and I cannot put my finger on it.

632
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:12,902
Here.
[Sniffs]

633
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,573
It smells like Aqua Velva.

634
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:19,275
Oh, my God.
<i>[Snoring Continues]</i>

635
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,979
Oh, my God.
It's Aqua Velva.

636
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:26,282
It's Aqua Velva.

637
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,291
[Mutters]
It's Aqua Velva.

It was the old lady's idea!

<i>What's gonna happen to them?</i>

<i>They didn't kill anybody,</i>

Uh, he's a real party animal.
[Laughs]

643

Okay. You drive safely, Natalie.

644
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:06,454
We'll see you around campus.
Thank you, Captain.
I will.

645
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,168
Happy anniversary, Adrian.

Sorry I didn't believe you.
