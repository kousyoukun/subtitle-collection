1
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,488
What you doing?

2
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,493
Flat tire.
You believe it?

3
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:31,530
Uh, no. I can't.
It's not your car.

4
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,302
- What are you doing?
- Let the cops sort this out.

5
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:04,887
You pay me for my advice, right?
Well, leverage everything.

6
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:08,092
Don't be afraid of a little debt.

7
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,102
Ronnie!

8
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,161
Hello?

9
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,434
Well, what's seven million bucks
between friends?

10
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:22,003
Hey, I'm losing you.
I'm in the garage.

11
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,175
All right. I'll call you tonight.

12
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,517
Don't turn around.

13
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,955
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you hear what I said?

14
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,493
Yeah. Yeah-
T-Take my keys.
Stay that way.

15
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:38,361
I don't want your car, Kemp.
Give me your hand.

16
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,899
My hand?
Yeah. Not that hand.
The other one.

17
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:46,131
No! No!

18
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:49,642
Have a nice day, Mr. Kemp.

19
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,475
Oh, God!

20
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,901
Man, did you see that game?
Those guys were just sleepwalking!
Oh!

21
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,909
We need a real running back.
Barlow's done.
He's all washed up.

22
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:01,913
Amen.
They're talking about football.
I have that one.

23
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,575
Give me the cards.
No. Mr. Monk, you don't
need the cards.

24
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,586
Just go talk to them.
You are an interesting person.

25
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,986
Can't you just be yourself?

26
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,657
Give me the cards.

27
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,730
Weather. Politics. Movies.

28
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,734
Swear words.
Swear words?

29
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,999
Don't you look at that one.
There it is- football.

30
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,535
I got it.

31
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,842
Hey.
Ah. Monk is here.
I guess we can all go home now.

32
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:38,611
You guys talking about
last night's game?

33
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:43,554
San Francisco 49ers
lost 27 points to 21 points.

34
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,217
Yes. We know.

35
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,283
It was a hell
of a fourth quarter though.

36
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:52,161
It was the turnovers.
They always come back to haunt you.

37
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,065
Yeah. I was just saying
Rattay can't handle the pressure.

38
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,159
I mean, why didn't they
take him out?

39
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,043
Excuse me.

40
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,569
What's that all about?

41
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,581
I don't know. Anyway...

42
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:17,120
That's true about Tim Rattay,
the quarterback.

43
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,853
But don't forget. He won four
out of his last five home games.

44
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,521
<i>But they were playing</i>
<i>in Houston, Monk.</i>

45
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:29,326
You guys want to hear
some swear words?

46
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,928
Hey, Monk?

47
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:38,605
- What are you doing?
- We're just talking about
the local football franchise.

48
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,044
Right. The Niners.

49
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:46,074
No. The San Francisco
<i>Forty</i>-Niners.

50
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:53,382
Come on. Body's over here.
Yeah. Sure. I'll catch
you guys on the flip side.

51
00:04:56,396 --> 00:05:00,389
There it is. Hearing them laugh
as I walk away, that's the worst part.

52
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,333
Mr. Monk, they're not
laughing at you.
Yeah. Right.

53
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:07,499
Victim "A"- the garage attendant.
His name was Ronnie, uh-

54
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,507
Uh, Ronald Shelton.
Shelton.

55
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:13,841
Guy worked here for two years.
Shot twice in the chest with a .45.
We recovered the shells.

56
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,211
Bang-bang, he's dead here.

57
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,876
The shooter then drags
Shelton's body this way...

58
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,919
and rolls him under this truck.

59
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,547
Then he hangs out here
in the garage and waits.

60
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,557
For what?
For victim "B."

61
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:30,255
<i>Warren Kemp.</i>
<i>He enters the garage at 7:30,</i>
<i>heads for his car.</i>

62
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,764
Sweet ride.

63
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,562
Yeah. I'm thinking of getting
one of these myself.

64
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:39,731
Meanwhile, back on Earth.
The killer forces Kemp
over to the car...

65
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:43,242
at gunpoint,
makes him put his hand
in the car door,

66
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,709
and breaks it.

67
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,508
He killed the first guy,
then waited around,

68
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,879
but then only breaks
the second guy's hand?

69
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,909
His right hand. Not his left hand.
He was very specific about that.

70
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,512
And then he takes off.
Kemp recognize him?

71
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,184
- No. He didn't see his face.
- Robbery?

72
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:04,389
Nope.
Why his hand?
Is he a musician or a surgeon?

73
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:08,230
He's a big-time stock analyst.
Works at one of the financial
places upstairs.

74
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:11,065
You know-
Buyouts and mergers.

75
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,537
Money for nothing.

76
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,632
Is that Monk?
Yeah.

77
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,904
He's supposed to be
some kind of genius,

78
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:22,573
- <i>like Sherlock Holmes.</i>
- Who's the girl?

79
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:25,811
<i>Uh, his assistant.</i>
<i>Natalie something.</i>

80
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,482
What you got?

81
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:42,564
Well, this tire iron is metric.

82
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,035
Doesn't fit this car.

83
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:48,335
In fact, all the cars down here
are American-made.

84
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:53,004
I think the killer
brought this down
to pretend to change a tire.

85
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,173
- He probably drives an import.
Good. What else?
- <i>Tweezers.</i>

86
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,615
Well, he's insecure.

87
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,855
He's always trying to impress people,
act tougher than he is.

88
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,857
<i>How do you know that?</i>

89
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,859
He was chewing on this.

90
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,691
<i>Toothpick.</i>

91
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,764
That's not conclusive.

92
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:19,032
<i>Captain?</i>
Just a theory.
It could- could be wrong.

93
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,335
Yeah? How's Kemp?
I can't release him yet.

94
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:25,503
Gotta get him back
to the hospital for some X-rays.
But he gave me a message.

95
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,978
He said to tell you
that he can meet Mr. Monk...

96
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,572
tomorrow morning
at his office, 10:00.

97
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,709
He says he hopes to see you too.

98
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,276
Who? Me?

99
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,992
Yes. Mr. Monk.
He's all the way to the end
and on the left.

100
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,078
Hi. Adrian Monk for Mr. Kemp.

101
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,583
He's on a conference call.
You can have a seat.

102
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,642
Okay.

103
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,418
I used to work
in a place like this.

104
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,260
I lasted about two weeks.
You do the same thing every day.

105
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,061
Same thing.

106
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,796
After a while, you begin
to feel like a number.

107
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,931
A number.
You're just like everybody else.

108
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,776
Everybody else.
You're basically a drone.

109
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,683
A drone?

110
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,745
<i>He's ready for you.</i>
<i>If you'll follow me.</i>

111
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,020
Mr. Monk.

112
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,464
Warren Kemp.
Forgive me for not shaking hands.

113
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,525
Oh. I don't mind.

114
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,628
It's Natalie, right?
His gal Friday.

115
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,265
Something like that.
How's the hand?

116
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:06,038
- Nine broken bones.
- One more would have been
an even 10.

117
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,205
You sound disappointed,
Mr. Monk.

118
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,875
Well, it's too late now.

119
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,884
Nice digs.
Yeah?

120
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,386
So this "buy low, sell high"
stuff really works, huh?

121
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:19,447
Well, apparently.
Wow.

122
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,925
<i>What's that hooked to the phone?</i>
<i>It's a voice scrambler.</i>

123
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,519
Some of the transactions
I handle are top-secret.

124
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,395
Security comes through
twice a week sweeping for bugs.

125
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,367
I feel like James Bond.
Please, sit down.

126
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:36,404
Mr. Kemp, I understand
that the man that attacked you
knew your name.

127
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:39,410
That's right.
But you didn't recognize him?

128
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,446
No. I never got
a good look at him.

129
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,312
- Did you recognize his voice?
- No. Sorry.

130
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,750
Any idea why somebody
would want to...

131
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,254
break your right hand?

132
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,951
Are you about to sign
an important contract?

133
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,016
Well, it wouldn't matter.
I can still sign my name.

134
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,585
I mean, if I make an "X,"
it would still be legal.

135
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,756
So you've been
moving furniture?

136
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:04,132
That's right.
I just hired a new decorator-
some feng shui nut.

137
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,899
She says if my desk
faces the door,

138
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,703
it would open me up
to new opportunities.

139
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,011
Maybe she was on to something.

140
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,883
- How did you know
about the furniture?
- Oh, impressions in the rug.

141
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,890
The desk used to be there.

142
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,052
That's pretty good.
Who's the detective here?

143
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,369
Mr. Kemp, uh-

144
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:41,235
Captain said that you wanted
to ask me some questions.

145
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:45,141
Mr. Monk, I'll admit it.
I'm scared to death.

146
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:50,080
I mean, this creep knew my name.
It could be someone close to me.
I agree.

147
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,913
The police have the building
staked out, but I need someone...

148
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,419
working here, undercover,
trying to figure it out.

149
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:59,254
I trust you.
I trust your judgment.

150
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,658
Can you...
recommend someone, or-
I'll do it.

151
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,753
- What?
- I'll do it.

152
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,197
Oh, thank you.
I-I feel better already.
You can start tomorrow.

153
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:11,498
No, no, no.
You don't understand.
He can't work in an office.

154
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,595
There-There are people here.

155
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,267
Nah, nah. He'll be fine.
I'll say you're, uh,

156
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,436
- an investment analyst
I'm bringing in from Chicago.
- Chicago.

157
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,776
<i>Yeah, all you have to do is,</i>
<i>you know, look busy.</i>

158
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,781
I'll give you some reports
to collate.

159
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,945
Did you hear that?
I'm gonna be collating.

160
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,623
<i>So you're from Chicago?</i>
<i>It's too cold for me.</i>

161
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,755
Not that the weather here
is much better.

162
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:42,062
The kitchenette.
Some of the food in that
machine is still edible.

163
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,625
Office humor. I love it.

164
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,571
Sales department's down there.
This is accounting.

165
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,575
We're redecorating
the whole office.

166
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,577
Do you smoke? If you do,
the smoke detector...

167
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,239
in the break room's usually
broken, if you know what I mean.

168
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,646
Isn't that kind of a fire hazard?
I hope so.

169
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,242
If we're lucky, this whole
friggin' place will burn down.

170
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:04,085
Here's your parking pass.
If you park in the garage, make sure
someone walks you downstairs.

171
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,590
We had a problem there
two nights ago.
Ah. I heard about that.

172
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,423
Why do you think someone would
want to break Kemp's hand?

173
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,760
Probably someone who heard him
playing piano at last year's
Christmas party.

174
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,426
Ah. More office humor.
That's good.

175
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,163
This is you.
Home sweet home.

176
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,228
This is me?

177
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,945
It's perfect.
Yeah, it's a dream come true.

178
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:31,346
What are you doing?
This is Adrian Monk.

179
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,784
He's starting here today.
Mr. Kemp said I could have
that cubicle.

180
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,516
What's the difference?
It's closer
to the emergency exit.

181
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,524
Statistically,
it's a little safer.

182
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,856
Statistically,
you're a little nuts!

183
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,192
Why don't you double up
on your medication
and get back to work?

184
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,370
Ignore him.

185
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,906
He's a little-

186
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,067
So, we're all set.

187
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,806
If you have any other questions,
don't hesitate to ask
somebody else.

188
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,446
Somebody else. I get it.

189
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,572
We're taking up a collection
for Chilton Handy.

190
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,706
It's his birthday. He's 40.

191
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,051
Oh, I, uh- I just got here.

192
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,212
You work here, right?

193
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,086
Most people put in 10 bucks.
I put in 20.

194
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,927
Okay. Okay then.

195
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,770
Here you go.

196
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,681
You're Chilton.

197
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:15,618
That's right. I'm turning 40.

198
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,622
Well, happy birthday.

199
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,624
What do you think
about what happened?

200
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,386
You mean to Kemp?

201
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,930
Well, it's pretty strange, huh?

202
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,523
Breaking his hand.
Why would somebody do that?

203
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:32,264
Maybe someone didn't like
their last employee evaluation.

204
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,365
<i>Captain, this just came in.</i>
<i>I think you'd better sit down.</i>

205
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:39,809
What is it?
I really think you ought
to sit down, sir.

206
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,848
I don't want to sit down, Randy.
What is it?
It's pretty big, sir.

207
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,906
What is it?

208
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,009
Okay.

209
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,450
Sir, it's just that when I got the call,
I was sitting down,
and I'm really glad I was.

210
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,288
Did somebody die?

211
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,886
Is anybody hurt?

212
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,174
I just got off the phone
with the S.E.C.

213
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,608
They're investigating Warren Kemp
for insider trading.

214
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,314
Is that it?
There's definitely a leak.

215
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,850
And they're pretty sure that
it's coming from inside the firm.

216
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,182
One theory
is that it's Warren Kemp himself.

217
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,518
But he was having second thoughts,
so our guy breaks his hand...

218
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,524
as a warning to keep him in line.

219
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,526
And that's it?

220
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:37,029
- Yes, sir.
- And you had me
sit down for that?

221
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,196
No. No, it wasn't just that.

222
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,934
I mean, you looked
a little bit tired.

223
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,705
- Is that my phone?
- Your phone?

224
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,408
Disher. Uh-huh. Yeah.

225
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:53,042
I got to take this, sir.
Yeah. No, no, no. I'm on my way.

226
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,052
Right. No. Absolutely.

227
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,613
Uh, yeah.

228
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,090
Adrian, really, you didn't have
to reorganize the whole filing room.

229
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,255
Uh, actually, I did.
And thanks again
for cleaning my office.

230
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,233
I can see my desk again.
You're gonna make somebody
a wonderful wife.

231
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,930
Oh, Greg, here's that
quarterly sales report.

232
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,907
I found a few typos
and grammatical errors,
so I retyped it.

233
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,102
Retyped the whole thing?
You're my hero.

234
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,111
So, where are we eating?

235
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,615
Let's just go to the Broadway Grill.
It's right across the courtyard.

236
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,589
Come on, Adrian.

237
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,449
Come on, Annette.

238
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,804
I'll get the next one.

239
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,932
- There's plenty of room here.
- I'd rather wait.

240
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,533
You can fit right here.
It's only two floors.

241
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,917
Okay, I'm- I'm- I'm fine. I'm-

242
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,146
W-We're not contagious.

243
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,316
I know you're not contagious.
I'll take the next one.

244
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,193
Mr. Monk.
I was worried about you.
How's it going?

245
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,858
I'm fine. It's going good.
Oh, good.

246
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:51,664
All right, I just talked to the captain.
The S.E.C.'s investigating this place.

247
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,671
They have a bank account
in the Cayman Islands.

248
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,674
Somebody's making millions
based on insider information.
Yeah.

249
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,870
They even have this crazy theory
that Warren Kemp's involved.
Isn't that insane?

250
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,709
Come on. Let's talk about it at lunch.
Oh, I can't.
I'm meeting the gang.

251
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,716
What gang?
I have a gang. I'm in the gang.
They're waiting for me.

252
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,844
What are you talking about?
Natalie, they like me.

253
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,049
I brought some cards along.
I haven't had to use them.

254
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:15,560
Nobody's laughing at me.
I got to go. I'll talk to you later.

255
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,652
Oh.
Oh. Mr. Monk,
how's the case coming?

256
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,720
Any leads?
Nothing concrete.

257
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,733
Uh, can't talk right now.
I gotta go.
The gang is waiting for me.

258
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,838
- Mr. Kemp.
- Warren. Please.

259
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,840
So, what are you doing here?

260
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:33,105
I was going to take
Mr. Monk to lunch,
but he had other plans.

261
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,544
So, you're free?

262
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,582
Yeah.

263
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,879
Hmm.

264
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,849
Here you go. Dig in.
Ah. Thank you, Pamela.

265
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,858
Let me get one.

266
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:58,369
Mmm. Mmm. Those are good.

267
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,565
Delicious.

268
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,940
So, is it hard
to work together...

269
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,206
and- and- and be in a relationship?

270
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,407
What?
What?

271
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,746
The two of you are having
a thing, right?

272
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,752
Why do you say that?

273
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,584
Well, your shirt-There's a hole
on the end of your collar.

274
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,386
Greg was wearing
that same shirt yesterday.

275
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,053
Plus you're using the same shampoo
and the same deodorant.

276
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:26,723
And today Greg walked in
with your umbrella.

277
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,766
Oh-

278
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,337
All right.

279
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:39,173
<i>You should be a detective.</i>

280
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:43,578
No. No. I-I couldn't be a detective.
I could never be a detective.

281
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:48,552
They're lonely.
They're-They're very lonely and sad.

282
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:54,220
They don't have a gang.
A gang from the office.

283
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,333
So this is how millionaires
do lunch, huh?

284
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:06,599
Ah. This is how millionaires
become millionaires.

285
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:10,073
And divorced
and stressed out and dateless.

286
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:16,937
Oh, I can see my boss from here.

287
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,279
He's laughing.

288
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,550
I hardly recognize him.

289
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:30,419
Is that yours?
Ah, it's beautiful.

290
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:34,090
Is it? I don't remember.
I haven't seen it in two years.

291
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,761
Warren, we gotta get you
out of this office. Gosh.

292
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:42,637
The last time I was in Vermont,
I was in jail.

293
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,767
What?
Yeah.

294
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:48,074
I hit a guy in a bar.
He wouldn't leave my friend alone,

295
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:50,080
so I just sort of shoved him
through the window.

296
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:55,176
If you're trying
to turn me on here, it's working.

297
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,417
Oh, my God. I can't believe
I just told you that.

298
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,890
You cannot tell anyone
I've been arrested, okay?

299
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:05,328
Mr. Monk- Oh, my God.
Julie, my daughter, if she knew?
Please. You have to promise me.

300
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,388
Oh, no. I promise.
Okay.

301
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,627
Now you have to promise me
something.
Yes.

302
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:13,569
That you'll keep calling
and reminding me
how pretty that cabin is...

303
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,335
until I can take you up there
and show it to you myself.

304
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,740
Okay.

305
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,852
<i>Hey, Sherlock Holmes!</i>

306
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,218
Come here!

307
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,849
We're trying to figure out
who did this.

308
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:46,094
- This is a human Caucasian buttocks.
- Yeah?

309
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:49,565
Yeah, we know.
But whose Caucasian buttocks?

310
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,296
Got to be Chilton.
Go to hell.

311
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,236
Uh, no. This is Ben.

312
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,498
Real mature, Ben.

313
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,745
<i>Oh-</i>
Ow!

314
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:05,749
How'd you know?
W-Well, the staples go out,
not in.

315
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:09,378
Ben's is the only stapler
in the office set to do that.

316
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,252
What are you doing?
Taking this down.
The tournament's over.

317
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,258
You guys forfeit.

318
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,487
Who said that?
We don't forfeit anything.

319
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:20,395
- It's our bowling league.
The finals are tonight.
- Okay, fine. I'll see you there.

320
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,923
But you're just gonna embarrass
yourselves even worse than usual.

321
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:27,130
Mr. Kemp was the only bowler
you had that didn't suck.

322
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:33,611
Mr. Kemp bowls?
Not anymore.
Not with a busted hand.

323
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:36,670
<i>The creep is right.</i>
<i>We're gonna get slaughtered.</i>

324
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:45,946
Bowling.

325
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,775
Yeah!

326
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,378
It's louder than I thought it'd be.

327
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,786
Do you really think that guy
killed somebody...

328
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:25,659
and broke Warren Kemp's hand
just to win a bowling trophy?

329
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,062
I know it's crazy, but look at him.

330
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,500
<i>He's completely obsessed!</i>
<i>And not in a good way like me.</i>

331
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,731
Plus, he's a toothpick chewer.

332
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,365
Does he have an alibi
for Monday night?
Good question.

333
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:38,534
Adrian, you're up.

334
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,044
- Me?
- We need someone to fill in
for Mr. Kemp.

335
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:43,546
Why do you think
we asked you to come?

336
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,379
Because... I'm one of the gang.

337
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:48,749
Here's your shirt.
Find a ball.

338
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:11,041
All right. Good eye. Good eye.
Find your ball.
That's it. Yeah.

339
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,089
A walk's as good as a hit.

340
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,478
Here.

341
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,588
Could you take it?
Take it! Take it!

342
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,369
All right!

343
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,372
<i>That's good, Adrian.</i>

344
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,601
Roll it now.

345
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:28,844
Oh, yeah!
That's amazing!

346
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:31,381
<i>Yeah!</i>

347
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,711
One more, it would have been
an even 10.

348
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:38,221
Oh, you get another chance.
You get two balls.

349
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,257
Really?

350
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,427
Go get it.

351
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,020
Do it.
Yeah!

352
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,031
Get 'em.

353
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,568
You're so slow.
I'm-

354
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:19,387
<i>Come on. Let's go celebrate.</i>

355
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,796
<i>All right-</i>

356
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:33,602
<i>I got another one!</i>

357
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:38,271
Oh, my God!

358
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,655
Yes!
<i>Yeah! Strike!</i>

359
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:52,487
Hey, did you watch that
comedy show on TV Monday night?

360
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,532
What?

361
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,534
It was about this family
that argued all the time,

362
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:59,593
and the father was always wrong.

363
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:04,973
You could hear the audience laugh,
so that you knew it was funny.

364
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,034
I missed it.

365
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:15,051
Where were you?

366
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,987
Pardon me?
Monday night. Did you go out?

367
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,990
Are you a cop?
No.

368
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,458
Then I don't have
to talk to you, do I?

369
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,833
So, who's the girl with Adrian?
Didn't you get that e-mail?

370
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,567
Somebody's been sending messages
to the whole office about her.

371
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:39,405
Her name's Natalie something.
She's been hitting on Mr. Kemp.

372
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:42,241
You're kidding.
And get this.
She's done time.

373
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,247
She almost killed a guy
in Vermont.

374
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,251
Thanks.

375
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:53,982
Hello?
<i>Everybody knows</i>
<i>about Vermont, Warren.</i>

376
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,856
They're all talking about it.
I told you that in confidence.

377
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,192
Natalie, I didn't tell anybody.
I swear.

378
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,392
Well, somebody's e-mailing
your whole office, and nobody
but you knew about it.

379
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,334
- Natalie, you have to believe me.
- Like hell I do.

380
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,199
Mr. Monk, we need to talk.
Natalie, look at this.

381
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:15,713
Chilton has an alibi.
He was here Monday night.
He bowled a 294.

382
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,010
<i>I don't know what to think.</i>

383
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,016
Well, I think
Warren Kemp's involved.
What?

384
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:23,542
Maybe the S.E.C. was right,
that it's an inside job.
I do not trust that guy.

385
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:26,419
I thought we liked him.
I thought we liked him a lot.

386
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:30,222
Well, we don't. You know what?
I'll just meet you outside, all right?
I got to get some air.

387
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:33,230
Adrian! We're only down two pins.

388
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:36,028
If you can roll three,
we can win the game.

389
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,092
No problem.

390
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,570
Foul! That's a foul!
He can't wear those.

391
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,732
He's wearing street shoes.
They're not regulation.

392
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:46,402
But he's been wearing them
the whole game.
I don't care.

393
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:49,241
He can't bowl if he's not
wearing regulation footwear.
That's a rule.

394
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,908
Fine. We'll just rent him a pair of shoes.
What size are you?

395
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,679
Uh, here's the thing.
When you say "rent a pair,"

396
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:58,586
you're talking about footwear
that other people have already worn?

397
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:01,591
That's right.
On my feet.

398
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,923
Here- Here's the thing.

399
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:07,260
I don't like to share... anything.

400
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:10,096
- Fine. Let's just buy him a new pair.
- Pro shop's closed.

401
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,762
So what's it gonna be?
If he doesn't bowl, you forfeit.

402
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:15,829
Here. We're about the same size.

403
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,670
What the hell are you looking at?

404
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:26,942
They're just shoes.
Just put them on.

405
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:29,452
Here's the thing-
Okay, stop saying
"Here's the thing."

406
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,921
Just put on these shoes for 20 seconds,
then you can take them right off.

407
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,327
Twenty seconds. I don't know.

408
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,794
So you forfeit?

409
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,232
Listen.

410
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:46,395
We've been waiting five years
to beat these creeps.

411
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:49,736
All you have to do
is put on Greg's shoes...

412
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:52,298
and roll the frickin' ball.

413
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,648
I can't.

414
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,513
Yes! We win!
Oh, yeah!

415
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,917
Yes! That's a forfeit! We win!

416
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:06,150
Forfeit. Forfeit.
Forfeit. Forfeit. Losers.
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

417
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,321
Hey, hey. I bought some-

418
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,521
I bought some bowling shoes.

419
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,067
I'll tell you what you can do
with those.

420
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,466
Put 'em-

421
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,406
That's a new one.

422
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,578
What do you think?
I'm sorry?

423
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,240
Which one do you like?
I'm doing the windows
and all the offices.

424
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,579
I'm trying to brighten up
everyone's spaces.

425
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:10,246
Which one? This one?
I think it's just a tad bit
more sunshiny. Don't you think?

426
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:14,257
- Yes, it's very sunshiny.
- All right.

427
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,059
What are you doing?
What do you want?

428
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:01,264
Okay, take anything.
Take anything you want. Uh-

429
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,274
You want that pillow?
Take that pillow. It's Italian.

430
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:07,641
Oh, my God.

431
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,668
What does it mean, Lieutenant?

432
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:43,945
I think it means the killer
was very intelligent.

433
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,676
So it was the same guy
as the garage?

434
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,881
Yeah. It looks like it.
We recovered
the bullets- .45 caliber.

435
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:54,982
They're comparing it now.
Uh-

436
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,027
Something else too, sir.

437
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,120
It's pretty big.

438
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,401
Don't worry.
You don't have to sit down.

439
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:07,302
I mean, you <i>can</i> sit.
I mean, sit or stand.

440
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:10,363
Can I walk away?
I'll just tell you.

441
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,535
The victim, Angela Dirks-
She was an interior designer.

442
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,909
We found some recent invoices.

443
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,916
Guess what?
She was working
for Pross Financial Services.

444
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,982
The same company.
Yes, sir.

445
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:38,259
So the guy breaks the boss's hand,

446
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:41,772
and then four days later
he kills the interior decorator?

447
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,469
What the hell is going on
up there?

448
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:48,034
<i>But that's pretty weird</i>
<i>about the decorator getting killed.</i>

449
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,273
There's gotta be a connection.
Don't you think?

450
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,751
Mr. Monk?

451
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,753
That was our table.

452
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,755
We ate nachos.

453
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:03,658
<i>You</i> ate nachos?
No. But I pretended to.

454
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:08,563
And then later Ben made
a copy of his Caucasian buttocks,

455
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:11,193
which was very funny.

456
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,669
Although I don't know
exactly why.

457
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,933
Mr. Monk, it's their loss.
Really, it is.

458
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,238
They're all at the Chinese restaurant
down the street.

459
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:23,974
I saw them sneaking out
so I wouldn't come with them.

460
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,008
- Uh-oh. What is that?
- What?

461
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:31,521
There's-There's something-
Is that a hair?
Where?

462
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,580
No. It's okay. It's just celery.

463
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,391
Natalie, I think
I know what happened.

464
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,483
What?
I solved the case!

465
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,553
Why are you talking like that?
You see that guy by the window?
The guy in the green jacket.

466
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,728
When I said there was
something in your soup,
he reacted.

467
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,103
He looked at his soup.
His suit?

468
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:26,234
His <i>soup</i>! Soup!
Well, maybe he heard you.

469
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:30,076
No, no, no. He couldn't have.
He must have read my lips.

470
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:34,481
He can read lips!
That explains everything.

471
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:38,613
It does?
Yeah. He's been sitting
at that same table...

472
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:42,181
<i>every time I've been in here.</i>

473
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,356
He must have been sitting there
about a month ago.

474
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:50,491
<i>At some point,</i>
<i>he looked out the window,</i>

475
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:56,029
<i>and he saw something-</i>
<i>something worth millions of dollars.</i>

476
00:37:56,107 --> 00:38:00,703
What? What did he see?
He saw Warren Kemp.

477
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,338
<i>He's been reading Warren's lips.</i>

478
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:08,818
<i>From that table, he has</i>
<i>a perfect view into Warren's office.</i>

479
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:12,219
It's a company
called Maine Fiber Optics.

480
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,158
32.50 a share.
Before September 2nd.

481
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,691
<i>Buyouts, mergers-</i>

482
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:23,029
That kind of inside information,
it's worth a fortune.

483
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,831
Don't look! Don't look.
He's staring right at us.

484
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:29,634
I'm sure everyone is,
the way you're grinning.

485
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,232
That's okay.
He'll just think we're in love.

486
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,747
You don't look like you're in love.
You look like someone who's had
some sort of industrial accident.

487
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,873
Here. Just-

488
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:42,446
I don't get it.
Why would he break Warren's hand?

489
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,011
Because Warren redecorated
his office last week.

490
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,751
Remember?
You noticed it yourself.
Yeah.

491
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,226
<i>He turned his desk around</i>
<i>so that when he held</i>
<i>the phone in his right hand,</i>

492
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:54,731
<i>he was blocking his mouth.</i>

493
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:58,701
- <i>Somehow he had to get Warren</i>
<i>to switch hands.</i>

494
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:01,932
That's what all this is about?
So he would hold the phone
in the other hand?

495
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:14,007
Why would he kill
the decorator?

496
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,914
Because she was planning
to put curtains up. Remember?

497
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,751
That would have ruined everything.

498
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:27,389
Oh, my God. Here he comes.

499
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:30,298
Mr. Monk, there's a mirror.
He could have been reading my lips.

500
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,863
Think you've figured
something out, huh?

501
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:38,238
What do you say we all take
a walk outside and talk about it?

502
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,068
I'm gonna grab the gun.
I can hear you.

503
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,876
I was born deaf,
but I'm okay now.

504
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,974
Modern science.
Now let's go.

505
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,417
Okay, okay.
We're going, we're going.

506
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,921
But you're making a huge mistake.

507
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:55,049
Do you know who this man is?
He's-

508
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:59,724
All right, don't move!
Stay where you are.

509
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,630
Don't worry. It's okay.
I used to be a cop.

510
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,568
- I'm calling the captain.
- Wait. Wait. Could you first
call Mr. Wok's?

511
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:11,438
- Why?
- That's where the gang is eating.
I'd really love them to see this.

512
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,784
I like the curtains.

513
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:23,945
Well, they're temporary.

514
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:26,114
They're moving me upstairs
to the 15th floor-

515
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,420
You know,
away from prying eyes.

516
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:30,960
Makes sense.

517
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,962
At least we know
who wrote that e-mail.

518
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:38,127
The killer must have been
reading our lips when we talked
about going to Vermont.

519
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:41,365
Guess he didn't want
his golden goose going
on vacation with anybody,

520
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,964
so he tried to break us up.

521
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:48,205
Look, Natalie, it doesn't matter
who wrote the e-mail.

522
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,645
I'm a bottom line sort of guy,

523
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:54,810
and the bottom line is,
I told you it wasn't me.

524
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,319
I swore to you,

525
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:59,948
and you didn't believe me.

526
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:06,053
You're right, you're right.
I'm sorry.

527
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,997
Can't we just pop this open
and pick up where we left off?

528
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:20,076
It's expensive.
Don't waste it.

529
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,662
How'd it go?
Let's get out of here.

530
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,433
There it is.
