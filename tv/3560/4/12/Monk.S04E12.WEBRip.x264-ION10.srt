Randy, get out
of my way!

163
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,185
(Disher)
What the hell happened?

164
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,722
Monk, what happened?

165
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:37,558
I'm going to need
statements from everybody.

166
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,806
Leland,
what are you doing here?

167
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:56,577
Did something happen?

168
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,879
Now that's a good question.

169
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,948
What did you do?

170
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,283
Did you turn the heat up?

171
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,952
It's like a sauna
in here.

172
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,687
Well, it's supposed to be

173
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,556
99 degrees exactly.

174
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:09,857
It's called
the Gidamer Method.

175
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,091
It's very therapeutic.

176
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,762
I can't breathe.

177
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,732
What happened to your hand?

178
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:21,669
I punched a cop.

179
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,103
You punched a cop?

180
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,772
Yeah. A Sergeant.

181
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:27,207
Ryan Sharkey.

182
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,208
Why?

183
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:31,612
You don't know?

184
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,849
He said you and he
were having an affair.

185
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:37,317
And you believed him?

186
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,820
Leland, he is lying.

187
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,154
Why would he lie, Karen?

188
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,591
Why would anybody lie
about something like that?

189
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:44,758
Well, I don't know.

190
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,694
Maybe it was a joke.
You know, cop humor.

191
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,261
I slept
with your old lady.

192
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:51,264
Ha ha ha.

193
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,933
So you're denying it.

194
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,102
No, I'm not denying it.

195
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,838
It's so crazy,
I won't even respond to it.

196
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,273
I can't believe
we're even talking about this.

197
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,610
Well, it sure would
explain a lot.

198
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:05,212
Like what?
You know.

199
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,016
Like you sleeping
in the guest room.

200
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,785
Because you've
been snoring.

201
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:14,922
I didn't just start
snoring, Karen.

202
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:18,558
Are you forgetting
our anniversary.

203
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:24,264
And you not wanting
to touch me anymore.

204
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,633
Leland,

205
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,767
we have problems.

206
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,101
I'm not saying we don't.

207
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,270
But that
isn't one of them.

208
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,774
Or at least it wasn't.

209
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:37,711
You used to tie
my neckties.

210
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:47,955
If he's convicted,

211
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,691
Michael Karpov is looking
at 25 years to life,

212
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:54,361
which gives us motive
with a capital M.

213
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,696
That makes him
suspect number one.

214
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:56,964
What about physical evidence?

215
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,999
Unfortunately,
there's not much.

216
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,835
The crime scene was contaminated
by two of our own.

217
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:03,671
That's the bad news.

218
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,673
The good news is
there's a witness.

219
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,074
A homeless man.
A transient.

220
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,076
A homeless transient.

221
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,678
He's known as, uh,

222
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:11,679
Jerry or Gerald.

223
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,413
35, maybe 40 years old.

224
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,115
If we can find him,

225
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,984
we can bring Karpov in
for a line-up.

226
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:19,419
Thank you, Lieutenant.
I'll take it from here.

227
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,255
Actually, sir.
I'm in charge.

228
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,324
Says who?

229
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,826
Deputy Chief.

230
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,065
I'm really sorry, sir.

231
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,136
Oh.

232
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,405
Well, carry on.

233
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,440
I'll be in my office.

234
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,976
Wait, why don't you
keep the pointer.

235
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,446
I don't want
the pointer, Randy.

236
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,149
You're doing a great job.
Carry on.

237
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:50,317
Oh, no. It's okay.

238
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,985
I can use my finger.

239
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,955
See, look.
Works just as well.

240
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,424
Even better. It bends.

241
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,293
Take the pointer, Randy.

242
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,840
All right,
let's get to work.

243
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,745
(Monk)
Careful. Both hands.
That's too high.

244
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,446
Ugh, those things
are death traps.

245
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,082
That's not just my opinion.

246
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,149
It's a fact.

247
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:59,152
Belgium, 1952, a kid
almost died on one of those.

248
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,153
There he is.

249
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:01,789
Where?

250
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,256
That guy?
Yeah.

251
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,992
He doesn't look
like a drug dealer.

252
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,259
He's indicted
for dealing.

253
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:09,262
He's guilty
of a whole lot worse.

254
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:13,133
Mr. Karpov,
good morning.

255
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,135
Got a minute?

256
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,170
Captain Stottlemeyer,
for you, any time.

257
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:20,140
Teddy.
These men are policemen.

258
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:23,343
What do we do
when we see a policeman?

259
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:24,444
Very good. See?

260
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,814
I'm teaching him respect
for the law.

261
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:29,149
Chicklet has passed on.

262
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,318
Yes, I heard.
Heartbreaking.

263
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,120
Hello. You have a little--

264
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:34,221
you have a smudge there.

265
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,224
I bet I can read
your mind, Captain.

266
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,559
You want to know where I was
yesterday morning.

267
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,829
That's right.
Around 6:00 a.m.

268
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,931
6:00 a.m.

269
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,332
I was in bed
with my beautiful wife

270
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,366
where I belong.

271
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,170
Can you prove that?

272
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,271
That's not the question.

273
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,240
The question is
can you prove I wasn't?

274
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,143
Do you own a stun gun,
Mr. Karpov?

275
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,845
What would I do
with a gun?

276
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:00,013
I'm a businessman.
I import furniture.

277
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,181
Oh, you do.

278
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,382
And you are
a very pretty lady.

279
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,251
Perhaps I could sell you
a end table,

280
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,254
hand-carved from Estonia,
then you would believe me.

281
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,523
Look.

282
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:13,126
You're watching me.
The press is watching me.

283
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,562
I would be a fool to sneak away
and do this thing.

284
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,030
And I'm not a fool.

285
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,265
Either you did it

286
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,233
or you hired somebody
to do it.

287
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,235
You see that, Teddy?

288
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,904
That is what they call
speculation.

289
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:25,906
Something that
the policemen do

290
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,574
when they're trying
to scare you.

291
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,276
Why don't you go play
with your friend.

292
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:32,479
There was a witness,
Michael.

293
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,982
A witness at the junkyard
who saw everything.

294
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,249
Ah, what did he say?

295
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:39,286
He? How did you know
it was a man?

296
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,289
He just said
it was a witness.

297
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,991
He, she,
doesn't hardly matter

298
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:46,326
because you are bluffing.

299
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,895
If you had any witnesses,

300
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,897
then I would be down
at your station house

301
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,231
for one of your
ridiculous line-ups.

302
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,867
There's gonna be a line-up
very soon.

303
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,073
Enjoy these moments
with your son, Michael.

304
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:01,508
Take lots of pictures

305
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,510
because you're not going
to be seeing him

306
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:07,080
for a very long time.

307
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,319
I think I'm sick.

308
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,321
Save yourselves.

309
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,322
She's going to blow!

310
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,629
Listen, um,

311
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,331
I need a favor.

312
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,132
Karen's going out
this afternoon.

313
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,334
She said she's going
to the movies.

314
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,169
I want you to follow her.

315
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,303
Oh, Captain. No.

316
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:31,571
You said
she denied everything.

317
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:32,940
She did.

318
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,007
Well, Captain,

319
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,208
that Sergeant was just
joking around.

320
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:37,677
He's just trying to impress
his idiot friends.

321
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,046
I don't think so.

322
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:40,347
Karen and me...

323
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,349
we don't even fight
anymore.

324
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,517
Last week she said
she was at her friend's house.

325
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,186
I called there.
She wasn't there.

326
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,188
The week before that,
it was the same thing.

327
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,257
Oh, Leland, don't--
don't ask me to do this.

328
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,325
Monk, I really need
to know.

329
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,227
I'd do it myself

330
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,229
but the Chief says
I need to go

331
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:57,197
to this
anger management class,

332
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,531
which really pisses me off.

333
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,068
I knocked out a tooth.
One tooth.

334
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,402
It's not like
I killed the guy.

335
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,238
Who was that clown?
I've never seen him before.

336
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:07,074
Ryan Sharkey, Jr.
He was a motorcycle cop.

337
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,708
He just transferred in
from Mendocino.

338
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,277
Wait.
You pulled his file?

339
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,644
You bet I did.

340
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,513
He's a real hotshot.

341
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,115
Has a couple of big arrests.

342
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,117
He's been cited
for bravery twice.

343
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,618
And I hear he's a real
ladies' man.

344
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,054
You want some advice?
Forget what he said.

345
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,522
Just forget it.

346
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,224
Go home
and hug your wife.

347
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,193
I don't want
any more advice.

348
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,328
I want to know where Karen
is going this afternoon.

349
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:29,396
What if she sees us?

350
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,197
She's going to know

351
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,199
that you asked us
to follow her.

352
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,533
Wouldn't that be worse?

353
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,335
Worse than not knowing?

354
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,636
Isn't it killing you

355
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,039
not knowing what happened
to Trudy?

356
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,176
How many times
have I asked you for a favor?

357
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,279
103. Counting this,
104.

358
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:50,283
How many times
have I said please?

359
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,223
Okay.

360
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,639
Okay, here's how
you follow someone.

361
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,010
Stay at least
40 feet back.

362
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:21,348
Not more than 60.

363
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,454
And whenever possible,

364
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:31,624
try to use
reflective surfaces.

365
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,593
Reflective surfaces.

366
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:43,570
Yeah, see.

367
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,238
Very discreet.

368
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:47,107
Reflective surfaces.

369
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,509
Wait a minute. I lost her.
Where'd she go?

370
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,212
Hey, would this be considered
a reflective surface?

371
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:56,449
Yeah. Well, mirrors--
mirrors are good too.

372
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,253
Oh oh oh oh oh.

373
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:04,091
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

374
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,258
She's going.
She's going.

375
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:07,160
Wait a second.
What is that on my collar?

376
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,395
Come on!
What is that?

377
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:12,565
Okay, come on.

378
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:17,270
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

379
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:19,206
I hate this.

380
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,373
Yeah, I do too.

381
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:22,242
How long have they
been married?

382
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:23,410
Forever.
Karen and Leland.

383
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,545
And they've never had
one thing

384
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,580
in common.

385
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:30,583
I remember this one weekend
he went hunting

386
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,553
and she stayed home

387
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:37,690
and organized a rally
for stronger gun control.

388
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,259
It's hard when people
get married

389
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,460
that young, you know.

390
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,595
They get older.
They change.

391
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,131
Not me.

392
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,533
I know not you,
but people.

393
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,537
Go, go, go, go, go.

394
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,182
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

395
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,750
Okay, Mr. Monk.
Come on. Come on.

396
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,218
She's getting away.

397
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,853
But you can't just
leave her like this.

398
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,188
It's a mannequin!

399
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:10,623
Why do you say things
like that?
Oh!

400
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:12,259
Sorry.

401
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,904
So we're at her favorite
restaurant, okay?

402
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,274
And I'm spending
like a whole week's paycheck

403
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:28,675
on this one dinner.

404
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,910
And then this jerk
at the table next to me

405
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,246
keeps yapping
on his cell phone.

406
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,283
I hate those cell phones.

407
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,817
You can't have
a decent conversation anymore.

408
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,286
Did you say
your affirmation?

409
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,454
Yes. Yes, I did.

410
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,790
Okay. I tried.
I really did.

411
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:46,593
I said, "Please, we're
trying to enjoy our dinner."

412
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,595
And then his cell phone
rang again.

413
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,263
And I guess I lost it.

414
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:53,333
I threw a plate.

415
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,235
A couple of plates.

416
00:18:55,268 --> 00:19:01,608
[cell phone ringing]

417
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:07,380
Excuse me.

418
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,751
Yeah.

419
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,287
Uh-huh.

420
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,223
Look, I can't talk
right now, okay?

421
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:17,624
I'll call you later.

422
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,427
Leland, would you mind
turning that off?

423
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,729
I can't.
I'm on duty.

424
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,597
So what are you? A cop?

425
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,267
That's right.

426
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,601
You think you're
better than me

427
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,303
because you're a cop?

428
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,439
No, Peter, I think
I'm better than you

429
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,574
on general principle.

430
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,743
Well, at least I have
some rough idea

431
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,445
of where my wife is.

432
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,781
Leland.

433
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,283
Leland.
Look at me.

434
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,285
Look. Look at me.

435
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:49,589
Say your affirmation.
I want to hear it.

436
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,661
These things happen.

437
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:58,298
Say it again.

438
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,267
These things happen.

439
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,403
Sit down.

440
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:07,307
These things happen.

441
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,410
Leland is angry,
which is what?

442
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,011
(all)
A feeling.

443
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,747
That's right.
Anger is just a feeling.

444
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:15,982
Leland,

445
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:17,817
you don't have to act
on your feelings.

446
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,985
You're an adult.

447
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,820
You can choose
how you want to respond.

448
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:22,655
You're absolutely right.

449
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,324
I'm going
to give you something.

450
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:25,792
It's a backup plan
in case

451
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:26,926
you're out in the world

452
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,027
and you're in a situation

453
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,398
and your affirmation
is not working.

454
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:33,300
It's a fact.

455
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,467
You can't stay mad
at anybody

456
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:37,304
when you're playing
with a yo-yo.

457
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:39,972
I want you to take this
with you.

458
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:44,277
I don't think so.

459
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:45,678
You understand

460
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:48,815
if I don't sign
your certificate of completion,

461
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:52,619
you're gonna be with us
for another six weeks.

462
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:00,293
Thank you.

463
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:12,405
How's that feel?
It feels great.

464
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,341
Good.
Thank you.

465
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:19,446
God--
Leland, Leland,

466
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:22,815
you don't have to do it
that fast.

467
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:27,354
Yes, I do.

468
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:33,660
All right, well,
I've checked everywhere.

469
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,328
There's no movie theater
in this mall.

470
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:36,663
So she lied about that.

471
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:38,365
Uh-huh.

472
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:39,532
Oh, there she goes.

473
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:41,668
Mr. Monk,
we gotta go.

474
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:43,536
Uh, look.

475
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,373
$10.03. That's how much
is in there.

476
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:47,807
Okay. Thank you.
Now we know.

477
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,742
Yeah, I think we should
make it even.

478
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:51,478
What are you
talking about?

479
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:52,979
The fountain.

480
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:55,748
If we take out three cents,
then it'll be $10.

481
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:58,385
It's a nice
round number. $10.

482
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:00,019
And everyone
will be happier.

483
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,355
You always say that.
Who is everyone?

484
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:05,358
Me...

485
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:06,926
Me.

486
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,429
You want me to reach in there
and take out three pennies.

487
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:10,763
Would you mind?
Yes, I would.

488
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:12,399
Look, she's moving again.
We gotta go.

489
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:13,299
Mr. Monk, if we walk now,

490
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,134
you won't even think
about the fountain.

491
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,837
I'll think about it.
It would haunt me.

492
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,507
The three extra pennies.
It would haunt you?

493
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:26,345
[softly]
It would haunt me.

494
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:36,456
There. Okay? Okay.

495
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:47,867
[gasps]
Oh, my God!
She really is seeing somebody.

496
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,402
Oh, no.

497
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:51,404
Oh, no,
the poor Captain.

498
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:52,939
Is it Ryan Sharkey?

499
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,807
I don't know.
I can't see his face.

500
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:56,709
I'll try to get closer.

501
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:58,411
'Scuse me.

502
00:22:58,445 --> 00:23:00,713
Did you just take money
from that fountain?

503
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:02,549
No.

504
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,050
Ma'am.

505
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:08,054
Well, yeah,
I mean--
We were making it even.

506
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:09,088
Come with me, please.

507
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,590
I just need to get
a shot.

508
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:12,459
I don't want any trouble.
Just come with me.

509
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:14,160
You too.

510
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,396
(Natalie)
Get the shot.

511
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:27,874
"A thousand seemingly
unrelated facts

512
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,042
"were coming together
in Mark's mind

513
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,479
"to form an undeniable truth.

514
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:35,081
"A picture
of absolute clarity

00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:39,118
"where before there had been
confusion.

516

517
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:45,224
"I know how Winston Brant

518
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,127
"And I know who did it."

519
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,228
Can you believe it?

520
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,198
What kind of degenerate
tears out the last two pages

521
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:54,667
of a Diagnosis Murder
mystery book?

522
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,843
What are you doing?

523
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,479
[stun gun zaps]

524
00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:08,147
What are you doing?

525
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,482
I'm not going
to say anything.

526
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:12,819
I promise.
Sorry, Gerald.

527
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:14,487
[stun gun zaps,
Gerald screams]

528
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:18,558
Aaaaah!

529
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:20,226
thud!

530
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,648
[cell phone ringing]

531
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:42,915
It's the Captain
calling again.

532
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:44,083
Don't answer it.

533
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,518
Well, we can't
avoid him forever.

534
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:46,919
We've got to try.

535
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:49,255
Gerald Vengal?
Hi, I'm Lieutenant Disher.

536
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:50,623
San Francisco police.

537
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,892
This is Adrian Monk
and Natalie Teeger.

538
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,727
How you feeling?

539
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:57,063
Like I got dropped
out of a three-story window.

540
00:24:57,096 --> 00:25:00,567
Luckily I fell
on a triple-corrugated

541
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,234
GE refrigerator box.

542
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:03,302
That's an excellent box.

543
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,171
If you gotta fall on a box,

544
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,839
try and make it
a GE triple-corrugated.

545
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:08,307
Well, I'll keep that in mind.

546
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,276
Monk, questions.

547
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:11,611
Yes. Yes.

548
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:12,278
Mr. Vengal.

549
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:13,980
Gerald.

550
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,115
Do you have any idea
approximately

551
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:20,286
when you'll be finished
chewing on that piece of meat?

552
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:25,291
Sorry. It's been a long time
since I had a real meal.

553
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:28,060
Listen, you guys
got to help me get out of here.

554
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:29,662
It's okay.
You're perfectly safe.

555
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:32,231
There's two policemen stationed
right outside the door.

556
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:35,334
It's not me.
I'm worried about Devo.

557
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,303
Who's Devo?

558
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:46,245
Mouse. Mouse.
Ah! Mouse!

559
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,615
I fell on the box
and Devo fell on me.

560
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:49,916
If the doctors find him,

561
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:51,584
I don't know what
they're going to do.

562
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:54,320
Hospitals hate rodents.
They're like fanatics about it.

563
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:56,322
We'll take care of Devo for you.
I promise.

564
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:58,157
He's actually kind of cute.

565
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,159
Natalie,
don't touch him.

566
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:02,128
Later on if we have time,

567
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:03,295
I'll tell you
a little story

568
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:05,164
about the Black Plague.

569
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:08,334
(Gerald)
He's not an ordinary mouse.
He's a genius.

570
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:10,169
Does impressions. Watch.

571
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:12,639
Devo, look at me.
Do a gerbil.

572
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:15,274
Be a gerbil.

573
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,976
He's shy, but he'll do it.

574
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:18,611
Come on, boy.
You can do it.

575
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:20,680
Yeah, go on.
You can do it. Do the gerbil.

576
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,215
There it is.

577
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,383
Did you see that?

578
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,351
Yeah. It's uncanny.

579
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:26,919
He's like Robert De Niro.

580
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:28,387
(Monk)
Mr. Vengal, uh,

581
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,356
those two burn marks

582
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:31,691
on your neck,

583
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:33,292
did he attack you
with a stun gun?

584
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,393
Yes, sir.

585
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,395
And you got
a good look at him.

586
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,097
I sure did. I'll never forget
that face

587
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,398
if I live to be 40.

588
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,200
And you're sure
it was the same guy

589
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,902
you saw before
in the junkyard.

590
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,336
Definitely.
The same guy.

591
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,338
Mr. Vengal, we think
we know who did this.

592
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:47,807
His name is Michael Karpov.

593
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,941
I'd like to bring you

594
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:50,643
down to the station house
later today

595
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:52,645
so you can take
a good look at him.

596
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:53,646
We'll set a line-up.

597
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,181
Mr. Vengal.

598
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:56,949
How we feeling today?

599
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,352
You finished with this?

600
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:02,421
All right.

601
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,691
I'm going to take
your pulse.

602
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:22,108
I'm sorry, folks,
but visiting hours are over.

603
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,275
He needs his rest.

604
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,344
Hoo-uh.
Thank you.

605
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,279
Are you okay?

606
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,681
Fine. Uh...

607
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:30,783
My shoulder's a little sore.

608
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:34,286
Mr. Vengal,

609
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,223
good to see you.

610
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,028
[knock at door]

611
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:17,363
Captain.
Hey.

612
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,165
I've been calling you guys
all day.

613
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,432
Have you been avoiding me?

614
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:22,001
Yes, we have.

615
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:26,773
We were waiting till we
could print this for you.

616
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:40,252
She's seeing somebody.

617
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:42,088
I knew it.

618
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:43,923
Who is it?

619
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:45,892
We never saw his face.

620
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:47,994
Is--is--is this the only
photograph you got?

621
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:50,329
Well, we sort
of got arrested.

622
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:52,765
It's a funny story.

623
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,533
I don't want to hear it.
No, it's really funny.

624
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,069
I really don't want
to hear it.

625
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:58,304
That's Sharkey,
isn't it?

626
00:28:58,337 --> 00:28:59,238
I don't think so.

627
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:01,340
You look at the shape
of his left ear--

628
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:02,541
I don't want to hear

629
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,410
about the shape
of the man's ear, Monk!

630
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,078
It's him. I can tell.

631
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:15,922
These things happen.

632
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,391
These things happen.

633
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,760
These things happen.

634
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:28,334
Screw it.

635
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,211
Okay, guys.

636
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:41,213
I've got a line-up downstairs
in five minutes.

637
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:43,449
I need to fill it out.
Volunteers.

638
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:49,255
Fine. Pritchert,
how tall are you?

639
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,223
5'10".

640
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:52,524
Good, you just volunteered.
You're one.

641
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:54,060
Mr. Karpov, you're two.

642
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:55,527
I don't need
your court order.

643
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:57,563
You're just wasting
everybody's time.

644
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:58,898
We'll see.

645
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:00,466
Landow, you're three.

646
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:01,934
What's wrong with me?

647
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:05,437
Sorry, Harry.
You're too short.

648
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,575
It's funny.
It's funny.

649
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:12,478
Nolte, you're four.
I need one more!

650
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:15,114
Sharkey, you're in
the line-up.

651
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,082
You're five.

652
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:17,249
Not me, Lieutenant.

653
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:19,852
I just finished
a double shift.
I'm not asking you.

654
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:21,353
All right.

655
00:30:21,387 --> 00:30:23,022
Let's go. Let's do this.

656
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:26,325
Come on.

657
00:30:31,898 --> 00:30:33,866
Gerald,
this is Mr. Hoffman

658
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,869
from the District
Attorney's office.

659
00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:39,371
Just relax.

660
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:40,372
It's one-way glass.

661
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:42,474
They won't even know
you're here.

662
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,444
You ready?

663
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:47,846
Okay, send 'em in.

664
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:55,321
That--that's him.
That's the guy.

665
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,423
You recognize him,
don't you, Devo?

666
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:58,624
He's--

667
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:00,026
Wait.

668
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,327
Don't say anything.

669
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,062
We have to do this
by the book.

670
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:04,931
We have to wait
till they all step forward.

671
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:10,136
You know where
Ryan Sharkey's at?

672
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:12,504
He's downstairs
in a line-up.

673
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,009
Number two,
step forward.

674
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,526
Turn to your left.

675
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:40,132
Thank you.

676
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,904
Number three,
step forward.

677
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,382
Is that you?

678
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,549
You're pathetic.

679
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,151
Thank you.

680
00:31:59,185 --> 00:32:01,920
Number four,
step forward.

681
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,332
Number three, please put
the yo-yo away.

682
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,471
Number four,
turn to your right.

683
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:23,642
Thank you.

684
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,378
What's your problem, bud?

685
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:29,048
You're the problem, bud.

686
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:31,317
Number four,
please let go of number three.

687
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,451
Number five,

688
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:34,320
stop kicking.

689
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:36,755
Number two, step forward.

690
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:41,427
Number three, please let go
of number four and step forward.

691
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,129
Ouch.

692
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:45,464
How's it going?

693
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:46,498
(Disher)
Please stop.

694
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:48,067
Stop. Stop. Please.

695
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:52,138
Please let go
of number three.

696
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:53,572
Whoa, Sergeant.
Careful.

697
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,045
Wait. He--he-he's
in there!

698
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:00,379
The killer's in there!

699
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:01,447
I'm sure he is,
Mr. Vengal,

700
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,781
but it doesn't matter.

701
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,316
The line-up is busted.

702
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,592
(Monk)
That might have been
the worst line-up

703
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,394
in the history
of law enforcement.

704
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:17,529
Yeah, it wasn't
exactly textbook, was it?

705
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:19,798
Captain,
what should I do?

706
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,800
You do your job, Randy.

707
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,802
You write it up
exactly as it happened.

708
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,437
Don't worry about me.

709
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,140
Where's Karpov?

710
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:29,641
We had to let him go.

711
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:31,477
Sergeant, sit down.

712
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,245
I'm gonna need a statement

713
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,446
from you too.

714
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,182
Leland, Natalie called

715
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:38,084
to tell me that you've
been fighting again.

716
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:39,185
Are you okay?

717
00:33:39,218 --> 00:33:41,787
Yeah, I'm okay.

718
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,091
Why don't you ask
about your boyfriend?

719
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:46,725
Hey, Karen.

720
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:50,162
Leland, I've never seen
that man before in my life.

721
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:52,498
Karen, you can
stop pretending.

722
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:56,435
Now you're
just insulting me.

723
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:58,404
Karen,
would you just tell him?

724
00:33:58,437 --> 00:33:59,805
Leland.

725
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:01,573
I know you want to kill me.

726
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:03,309
I'd probably feel
the same way, all right?

727
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:04,510
But you gotta understand.

728
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,345
Whatever happened
between Karen and I

729
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,414
didn't mean anything,
all right?

730
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:10,582
It was a mistake.

731
00:34:10,616 --> 00:34:12,251
I'm sorry.

732
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:13,452
I'm apologizing to you.

733
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:15,321
Who are you?

734
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:17,556
Leland, he must be crazy.

735
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:18,724
Sweetie,
it was fun.

736
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,792
You gotta face
the music.

737
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:22,494
It's over between us.
Okay?

738
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:24,596
Okay, I don't know him.
You've got to believe me.

739
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,165
Do I?

740
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:27,499
Yes, you do.

741
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:28,634
You have to believe me.

742
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,536
Why would he--
why would he lie, Karen?

743
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,138
Why would he say
these things?

744
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:33,205
'Scuse me.

745
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,506
'Scuse me, Sergeant.

746
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,774
Are you chewing that apple

747
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,143
on your left side?

748
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:39,878
Yeah so?
Why?

749
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,713
Why? Because your friend
knocked my tooth out

750
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,449
two days ago, remember?

751
00:34:43,482 --> 00:34:44,550
Yes, I remember.

752
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:48,287
But he didn't hit you
on this side.

753
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,322
The Captain
is right-handed.

754
00:34:50,356 --> 00:34:52,458
He hit you on the other side,
your left side.

755
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:54,826
The side--the side
you're chewing on.

756
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,363
Okay.

757
00:34:57,396 --> 00:35:01,267
The captain didn't knock
your tooth out, did he?

758
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,135
What are you, crazy?

759
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:04,603
I'm remembering a few
other things.

760
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:07,873
You--you used to work
in Mendocino, right?

761
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:10,509
When we saw Michael Karpov
in the park,

762
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:12,544
his son was wearing
a shirt

763
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:15,514
that said
"Mendocino Day School."

764
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,783
Michael Karpov lives
in Mendocino.

765
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,785
Uh, yeah. A lot of people
live in Mendocino.

766
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:21,620
I don't know
Michael Karpov.

767
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:22,654
I think you do.

768
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:23,722
Ten minutes ago downstairs,

769
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:26,358
you were wearing
those clothes

770
00:35:26,392 --> 00:35:28,560
and Karpov
called you Sergeant.

771
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:30,562
That's right.
I heard that too.

772
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:33,499
How did he know
you were a sergeant, Sergeant?

773
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:34,600
This is Disher.

774
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,302
Is Gerald Vengal
still in the building?

775
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:38,837
You work for Michael Karpov.

776
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,939
We always suspected
there was a cop

777
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,908
on his payroll.

778
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,610
You killed Chicklet,
didn't you?

779
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:47,179
That's why
you didn't shoot him.

780
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:48,680
Because you knew the bullet
could be traced

781
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:49,748
back to your weapon.

782
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:50,916
Here's what happened.

783
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:53,452
You lured Chicklet
to the junkyard.

784
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,321
But he fought back.

785
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:56,588
He must've hit you.

786
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:59,191
You were bleeding.
You lost a tooth.

787
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:01,760
You had a big problem.

788
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:03,595
Your DNA was all over
that crime scene.

789
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:04,930
The cops
were on their way.

790
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:06,898
You didn't have time
to clean it up.

791
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:08,400
You put your uniform on.

792
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:09,835
You returned
to the scene.

793
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:11,370
But you knew forensics

794
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:13,539
would be there any minute.

795
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:15,507
What to do?
What to do?

796
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,576
Then you had an idea.

797
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:19,578
I'm your husband.

798
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:22,481
That makes it my business,
okay?

799
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:25,651
If you picked a fight
with someone--

800
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:26,952
if you could provoke them

801
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:28,487
and get them to hit you--

802
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,422
you'd be home free.

803
00:36:30,456 --> 00:36:33,492
They could find your tooth,
your DNA, your blood.

804
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:36,562
You knocked
my tooth out. God.

805
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:37,963
Nobody would
ever question it.

806
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:39,665
You told my husband
we were sleeping together

807
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,600
so that he would hit you?

808
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:43,569
Oh, come--would you--
You can't prove any of this.

809
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:44,970
I think we can.

810
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:46,405
We can connect you
to Karpov.

811
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:48,640
We'll pull your phone bills,

812
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:49,708
your e-mails,
your bank accounts.

813
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:52,278
Yeah, I think you might need
a little more than that.

814
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:53,579
That's the guy.

815
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,381
I-I-I've been telling
you guys all day.

816
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:57,816
I saw him at the junkyard.
That's the guy!

817
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:01,420
Oh, hey, are--are
you done with that?

818
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:06,992
It's not for me.

819
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:08,560
It's for Devo.

820
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,997
He's had
a pretty rough day.

821
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:15,634
That mouse was in my pocket.

822
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:18,704
He was in my pocket.

823
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:24,476
Let's go, Sharkey.

824
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:38,624
Are you okay?

825
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:47,466
[nervous laugh]

826
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:50,402
Heck of a thing, huh?

827
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:51,603
[makes gunshot sound]

828
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,574
Actually,
it's kind of flattering,

829
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,309
if you think about it.

830
00:37:57,343 --> 00:38:00,746
He picked me because
he knew that I would react

831
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:03,449
'cause he could tell
how much I love you.

832
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:04,750
It's not flattering,
Leland.

833
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:08,520
Look, Karen,
I know that I've got a temper.

834
00:38:08,554 --> 00:38:10,522
But I've been working on it.

835
00:38:10,556 --> 00:38:13,359
I've got a yo-yo.

836
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:16,728
Actually, uh, the yo-yo broke
when I threw it at the guy.

837
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,730
Why didn't you believe me?

838
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,636
I had Monk follow you
yesterday afternoon.

839
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:27,373
He saw you meeting a man.

840
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:28,574
You had me followed?

841
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,949
You want to tell me
about him?

842
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:42,388
His name is Max Tepperton.

843
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:43,855
He's a divorce lawyer.

844
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:47,526
You've been sleeping
with a divorce lawyer?

845
00:38:51,597 --> 00:38:54,032
You know what,
it doesn't matter

846
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,667
because I forgive you,
Karen.

847
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:58,670
Hell, I'm no saint.

848
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:00,472
We'll get past this.

849
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:01,507
No, Leland.

850
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:12,651
He's representing me.

851
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:25,063
"Stottlemeyer
versus Stottlemeyer."

852
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,068
Why?

853
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,438
Because you have
to ask why, Leland.

854
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:37,743
That's why.

855
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:08,106
So is that it?

856
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,808
Yeah.

857
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:12,110
Twenty years.
Two suitcases.

858
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,846
Where are the boys?

859
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,816
They're with Karen.

860
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:19,718
At her sister's.

861
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,821
How they doing?

862
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:24,890
Not good.

863
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,859
Listen, Captain,
if you need

864
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:29,060
somebody to talk to,

865
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,762
here.

866
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:32,531
Just call any time
about anything.

867
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:33,832
Even in the middle
of the night.

868
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:35,000
Monk, I know your number.

869
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:36,067
It's not me.

870
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,736
It's Natalie's
home phone.

871
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,170
She's really good.

872
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:42,808
He's right. Any time.

873
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:46,011
Thank you.

874
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:47,579
Well, you know
the old saying.

875
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:49,881
"When God closes a door..."

876
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:55,587
When God closes a door,
sometimes he breaks your heart.

877
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:58,490
That's not the old saying.

878
00:40:58,524 --> 00:41:00,826
It is today.

879
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,673
