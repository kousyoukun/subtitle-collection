Ha, ha, ha."

151
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:54,762
- So you're denying it?
- No, I'm not denying it.

152
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:57,500
<i>It's so crazy I won't</i>
<i>even respond to it.</i>

153
00:08:57,574 --> 00:08:59,940
I can't believe we're even
talking about this.

154
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:02,842
Well, it sure would explain a lot.

155
00:09:02,912 --> 00:09:04,846
Like what?
You know.

156
00:09:06,349 --> 00:09:08,681
Like you sleeping in the guest room.

157
00:09:08,752 --> 00:09:11,243
Because you've been snoring.

158
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:14,313
I didn't just start snoring, Karen.

159
00:09:15,658 --> 00:09:17,990
And you forgetting our anniversary.

160
00:09:20,363 --> 00:09:24,129
And you not wanting
to touch me anymore.

161
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,430
Leland, we have problems.

162
00:09:26,503 --> 00:09:29,939
I'm not saying we don't,
but that isn't one of them-

163
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:33,475
Or at least, it wasn't.

164
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:36,808
You used to tie my neckties.

165
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:50,120
If he's convicted, Michael Karpov
is looking at 25 years to life,

166
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:53,060
which gives us motive
with a capital "M."

167
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:56,656
- That makes him suspect number one.
- What about physical evidence?

168
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:58,667
Unfortunately, there's not much.

169
00:09:58,735 --> 00:10:01,568
Crime scene was contaminated
by two of our own.

170
00:10:01,638 --> 00:10:04,801
<i>But that's the bad news.</i>
<i>The good news is,</i> <i>there's a witness</i>-

171
00:10:04,874 --> 00:10:06,808
A homeless man, a transient.

172
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:08,969
A homeless transient.

173
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:13,141
He's known as, uh, Jerry or Gerald,
35, maybe 40 years old.

174
00:10:13,216 --> 00:10:16,811
If we can find him,
we can bring Karpov in for a lineup.

175
00:10:16,886 --> 00:10:19,354
Thank you, Lieutenant.
I'll take it from here.

176
00:10:19,422 --> 00:10:21,982
Actually, sir, I'm in charge.

177
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:24,049
Says who?

178
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,028
Deputy chief.

179
00:10:27,096 --> 00:10:29,530
[Murmuring]

180
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:31,760
I'm really sorry, sir.

181
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:36,872
Oh. Uh-

182
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,376
Carry on. I'll be in my office.

183
00:10:40,443 --> 00:10:42,673
Wait a minute.
Why don't you keep the pointer?

184
00:10:44,681 --> 00:10:46,774
I don't want the pointer, Randy.

185
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,784
You're doing a great job.

186
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:50,843
Carry on.
Oh, no. It's okay.

187
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,583
I can use my finger.
See? Look. Works just as well.

188
00:10:55,658 --> 00:10:57,888
Even better. It bends.

189
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:59,895
Take the pointer, Randy.

190
00:11:09,105 --> 00:11:12,233
<i>[Door Closes]</i>
All right. Let's get to work.

191
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,531
<i>[Children Chattering, Laughing]</i>

192
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,399
[Monk]
Careful. Both hands. That's too high.

193
00:11:51,874 --> 00:11:55,833
Oh, those things are death traps.
That's not just my opinion. It's a fact.

194
00:11:55,912 --> 00:11:58,938
Belgium, 1952, a kid almost
died on one of those.

195
00:11:59,015 --> 00:12:01,540
There he is.
Where?

196
00:12:01,618 --> 00:12:03,017
Where? That guy?

197
00:12:03,086 --> 00:12:05,054
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Doesn't look like a drug dealer.</i>

198
00:12:05,121 --> 00:12:08,522
<i>He's indicted for dealing.</i>
<i>He's guilty of a whole lot worse.</i>

199
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,654
Mr. Karpov, good morning.
Ah.

200
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,426
Got a minute?
Captain Stottlemeyer, for you, any time.

201
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:20,128
Teddy, these men are policemen.

202
00:12:20,203 --> 00:12:22,330
What do we do
when we see a policeman?

203
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:24,396
Aha. Very good. See?

204
00:12:24,474 --> 00:12:26,669
I'm teaching him respect
for the law.

205
00:12:26,743 --> 00:12:31,077
Chicklet has passed on.
Yes, I heard. Heartbreaking.

206
00:12:31,147 --> 00:12:34,173
Hello. You have a little-
You have a smudge there.

207
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,185
I bet I can read your mind, Captain.
I'll get it.

208
00:12:37,253 --> 00:12:39,517
<i>You want to know where I was</i>
<i>yesterday morning?</i>

209
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:41,682
That's right, about 6:00 a.m.

210
00:12:41,758 --> 00:12:43,692
6:00 a.m. I was...

211
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,251
in bed with my beautiful wife,
where I belong.

212
00:12:49,098 --> 00:12:51,032
Can you prove that?
That's not the question.

213
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,193
The question is,
can you prove I wasn't?

214
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:56,067
Do you own a stun gun,
Mr. Karpov?

215
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:59,734
What would I do with a gun?
I'm a businessman. I import furniture.

216
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:02,334
Sure you do.
<i>And you are a very pretty lady.</i>

217
00:13:02,412 --> 00:13:06,143
Perhaps I could sell you an end table,
hand-carved, from Estonia?

218
00:13:06,215 --> 00:13:08,149
Then you would believe me.

219
00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:10,447
Look.

220
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,886
<i>You're watching me.</i>
<i>The press is watching me.</i>

221
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:16,789
I would be a fool to sneak away
and do this thing. And I am not a fool.

222
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:20,192
Either you did it,
or you hired somebody to do it.

223
00:13:20,263 --> 00:13:23,630
You see that, Teddy?
That is what they call "speculation."

224
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,534
Something that the policemen do
when they're trying to scare you.

225
00:13:27,603 --> 00:13:30,595
<i>Why don't you go play</i>
<i>with your friends?</i>

226
00:13:30,673 --> 00:13:33,733
There was a witness, Michael-
a witness at the junkyard-

227
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,108
who saw everything.
Oh. What did he say?

228
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:38,943
"He"? How did you know
it was a man?

229
00:13:39,015 --> 00:13:42,143
He just said it was a witness.

230
00:13:42,218 --> 00:13:45,984
He, she- Doesn't hardly matter
because you are bluffing.

231
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:48,580
<i>If you had any witnesses,</i>
<i>then I would be down</i> <i>at your station house...</i>

232
00:13:48,658 --> 00:13:53,493
in one of your ridiculous lineups.
There's gonna be a lineup. Very soon.

233
00:13:57,366 --> 00:13:59,391
Enjoy these moments
with your son, Michael.

234
00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:01,403
Take lots of pictures.

235
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:05,635
Because you're not gonna
be seeing him for a very long time.

236
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:09,911
Oh, finally. I got it.

237
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:12,174
I think I'm sick.

238
00:14:12,248 --> 00:14:15,149
Save yourselves. She's gonna blow!

239
00:14:15,218 --> 00:14:17,686
It's gonna get ugly.

240
00:14:21,057 --> 00:14:23,321
Listen, uh, I need a favor.

241
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:26,486
Karen's going out this afternoon.
She says she's going to the movies.

242
00:14:26,562 --> 00:14:30,328
I want you to follow her.
Oh, Captain, no.

243
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,629
You said
she denied everything. She did.

244
00:14:32,702 --> 00:14:36,263
That sergeant was just joking around.
He was just trying to impress his idiot friends.

245
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:38,273
I don't think so.

246
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:41,936
Karen and me-
We don't even fight anymore.

247
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:44,002
Last week she said she was
at her friend's house.

248
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,014
I called there.
She wasn't there.

249
00:14:46,082 --> 00:14:48,016
Week before that
it was the same thing.

250
00:14:48,084 --> 00:14:50,109
Leland, don't ask me
to do this.

251
00:14:50,186 --> 00:14:51,983
Monk, I really need to know.

252
00:14:52,054 --> 00:14:54,045
I'd do it myself,

253
00:14:54,123 --> 00:14:58,219
but the chief says I need to go
to this anger management class, which really pisses me off.

254
00:14:58,294 --> 00:15:00,694
I knocked out a tooth.
One tooth.

255
00:15:00,763 --> 00:15:03,789
It's not like I killed the guy.
Who was that clown? I've never seen him before.

256
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:06,198
Ryan Sharkey, Jr.
He was a motorcycle cop.

257
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:08,533
He just transferred in
from Mendocino.

258
00:15:08,604 --> 00:15:11,164
- Wait. You pulled his file?
- You bet I did.

259
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,231
He's a real hotshot.

260
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:16,745
Has a couple of big arrests.
He's been cited for bravery twice.

261
00:15:16,813 --> 00:15:20,305
And I hear he's
a real ladies' man. You want some advice?

262
00:15:20,383 --> 00:15:22,374
Forget what he said.
Just forget it.

263
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:25,978
Go home and hug your wife.
I don't want any more advice.

264
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:29,252
I wanna know where
Karen is going this afternoon.

265
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:32,158
What if she sees us?
She's gonna know that you asked us to follow her.

266
00:15:32,228 --> 00:15:34,924
- Wouldn't that be worse?
- Worse than not knowing?

267
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:38,592
Isn't it killing you, not knowing
what happened to Trudy?

268
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:42,763
How many times
have I asked you for a favor?

269
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,070
103.
Counting this, 104.

270
00:15:47,343 --> 00:15:50,744
How many times
have I said "please"?

271
00:15:54,684 --> 00:15:56,709
[Sighs]
Okay.

272
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:13,797
[Monk]
Okay, here's how you follow someone.

273
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,135
Stay at least 40 feet back.

274
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:19,902
Not more than 60.

275
00:16:25,047 --> 00:16:28,141
And, whenever possible,

276
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:31,812
try to use reflective surfaces.

277
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:34,482
"Reflective surfaces"?

278
00:16:42,498 --> 00:16:44,932
Yeah. See? Very discreet.

279
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:47,595
Reflective surfaces. What-

280
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,661
Wait a minute. I lost her.
Where'd she go?

281
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:52,606
Okay, would this be considered
a reflective surface?

282
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:56,236
Yeah. Mirrors-
Mirrors are good too.

283
00:16:58,247 --> 00:17:00,010

00:17:27,476 --> 00:17:29,410
I remember,

293
00:17:29,478 --> 00:17:31,639
this one weekend he went hunting...

294
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:33,978
and she stayed home...

295
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,780
and organized a rally
for stronger gun control.

296
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,215
It's hard when people
get married that young, you know?

297
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:42,348
<i>They get older.</i>
<i>They change.</i>

298

Yeah, not me.
I know not you, but people.

<i>They could find your tooth,</i>
<i>your DNA, your blood</i>-

603
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:38,892
- You knocked my tooth out. God.
- And nobody would ever question it.

604
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,588
You told my husband
we were sleeping together so that he would hit you?

605
00:36:41,663 --> 00:36:43,597
Oh, come-Would you-

606
00:36:43,665 --> 00:36:45,895
You can't prove any of this.
I think we can.

607
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:47,901
We can connect you to Karpov.

608
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:50,563
We'll pull your phone bills,
your e-mails, your bank accounts-

609
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:53,005
Yeah, I think you might need
a little more than that.

610
00:36:53,075 --> 00:36:55,441
That's the guy.
I've been telling you guys all day.

611
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:58,775
I saw him at the junkyard.
That's the guy.

612
00:36:58,847 --> 00:37:02,146
Oh. Uh, hey, are you done with that?

613
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,954
It's not for me.

614
00:37:07,022 --> 00:37:09,422
- It's for Devo.
- Mm-hmm.

615
00:37:10,592 --> 00:37:12,856
Mm-hmm.
He's had a pretty rough day.

616
00:37:14,029 --> 00:37:16,361
That mouse was in my pocket.

617
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:19,356
He was in my pocket.

618
00:37:23,171 --> 00:37:25,139
<i>Let's go, Sharkey.</i>

619
00:37:37,385 --> 00:37:39,319
Are you okay?

620
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:45,656
[Laughing]

621
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:51,292
Heck of a thing, huh?

622
00:37:54,402 --> 00:37:58,031
Actually, it's kind of flattering,
if you think about it.

623
00:37:58,106 --> 00:38:01,667
He picked me because he knew
that I would react-

624
00:38:01,743 --> 00:38:04,177
'cause he could tell
how much I love you.

625
00:38:04,246 --> 00:38:06,840
It's not flattering, Leland.

626
00:38:06,915 --> 00:38:09,349
Look, Karen, I know
that I've got a temper,

627
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:12,147
but I've been working on it.

628
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,916
I've got a yo-yo.

629
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,550
Actually, the yo-yo broke
when I threw it at the guy.

630
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:19,526
Why didn't you believe me?

631
00:38:22,164 --> 00:38:25,258
I had Monk follow you
yesterday afternoon.

632
00:38:26,902 --> 00:38:29,427
He saw you meeting a man.
You had me followed?

633
00:38:34,676 --> 00:38:37,338
You wanna tell me about him?

634
00:38:40,515 --> 00:38:42,745
His name is Max Tepperton.

635
00:38:42,817 --> 00:38:44,751
He's a divorce lawyer.

636
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,584
You've been sleeping
with a divorce lawyer?

637
00:38:52,794 --> 00:38:54,921
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

638
00:38:54,996 --> 00:38:57,556
Because I forgive you, Karen.

639
00:38:57,632 --> 00:39:01,193
Hell, I'm no saint.
We'll get past this.

640
00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:03,203
No, Leland.

641
00:39:10,645 --> 00:39:13,546
He's representing me.

642
00:39:22,657 --> 00:39:25,956
<i>"Stottlemeyer versus Stottlemeyer."</i>

643
00:39:29,064 --> 00:39:30,998
Why?

644
00:39:31,066 --> 00:39:33,125
Because you have to ask why, Leland.

645
00:39:36,504 --> 00:39:38,438
That's why.

646
00:40:06,368 --> 00:40:08,962
So is that it?
Yeah.

647
00:40:09,037 --> 00:40:12,097
Twenty years, two suitcases.

648
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:14,107
Where are the boys?

649
00:40:15,377 --> 00:40:18,778
They're with Karen...
at her sister's.

650
00:40:18,847 --> 00:40:21,839
How they doing?

651
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:23,941
Not good.

652
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:28,319
Listen, Captain,
if you need somebody to talk to-

653
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,553
Here. Just call any time,
about anything,

654
00:40:31,626 --> 00:40:34,220
even in the middle
of the night. Monk, I know your number.

655
00:40:34,296 --> 00:40:37,356
No, it's not me.
This is Natalie's home phone.

656
00:40:37,432 --> 00:40:39,730
She's really good.

657
00:40:39,801 --> 00:40:41,735
He's right. Any time.

658
00:40:43,071 --> 00:40:45,232
Thanks.

659
00:40:45,307 --> 00:40:47,901
Well, you know the old saying.
"When God closes a door"-

660
00:40:47,976 --> 00:40:51,275
Yeah, "When God closes a door,

661
00:40:51,346 --> 00:40:54,645
sometimes he breaks your heart."

662
00:40:54,716 --> 00:40:57,480
That's not the old saying.

663
00:40:57,552 --> 00:40:59,747
It is today.
