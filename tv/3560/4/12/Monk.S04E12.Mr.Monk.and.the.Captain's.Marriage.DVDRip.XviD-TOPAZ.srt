1
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,344
What's your problem?
It's your favorite-
Almonds and raisins.

2
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,941
Fine. Don't eat.

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,785
But I'm warning you,
that's it for the rest of the day.
Don't be complaining later.

4
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,450
Hey, come on.

5
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,618
<i>You're crazy, you know that?</i>
<i>You're nuts.</i>
Shh. Quiet.

6
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:31,790
<i>You wearing a wire?</i>
Be as quiet as a you-know-what.

7
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,095
<i>This is so bogus.</i>
<i>I'm not wearing a wire.</i>

8
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:37,466
Turn around. Turn around.
<i>Great. You know, I should</i>
<i>be friskin' you, man.</i>

9
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,471
<i>Yeah?</i>

10
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,530
Yeah? Why were you
talking to the D.A.?
Yeah.

11
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,803
Hey, they came to me.
What was I supposed to do?

12
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,744
<i>Did you roll over?</i>
<i>No! I didn't tell 'em anything.</i>

13
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:50,476
Did you roll over?
No! I swear to God, I didn't
tell 'em anything.

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,484
<i>You know me.</i>

15
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,316
Yeah, I know you, and you're
making me nervous.

16
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,652
Not just me.
You're making everybody nervous.

17
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,395
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

18
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:14,559
<i>Hey! Hey, there's a man in there.</i>
<i>He was chasing me.</i>
<i>I think he killed someone.</i>

19
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,568
Stay back here.
We'll take a look.

20
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,238
Monk!

21
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,775
<i>Natalie. Thanks for getting here</i>
<i>so fast.</i>

22
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,072
This is not an appliance store.

23
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,579
Uh, yeah. I know.
You said it was
an appliance store.

24
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:38,481
I'm sorry. I lied. But if I'd have
told you it was a junkyard,

25
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,576
it would have taken me
five hours to get you down here.

26
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,587
This is a junkyard.
Wait. So you lied to us?

27
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:46,591
I'm sorry. This is a big case.
It just went down
about 20 minutes ago.

28
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,423
We've got a fresh
crime scene for once.
I wanted him here right away.

29
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,554
I can't believe you lied to us.

30
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:54,429
I said I'm sorry I think twice.
How many times do I need
to apologize?

31
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,127
Six.
Six.

32
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,568
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Can we do this?

33
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,406
The victim was a small-time drug dealer-

34
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,773
Jimmy Botsdale.
They called him Chicklet.

35
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,745
- He used to work for Michael Karpov.
- Karpov? I was just reading
about that guy.

36
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,975
Karpov is going
on trial next month...

37
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,244
for criminal conspiracy
and money laundering.

38
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,084
I helped make the case.
Chicklet was supposed
to testify against him.

39
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:20,649
Look at all this junk.
They should get rid of it-
Put it somewhere.

40
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,786
They did, Mr. Monk.
They put it here. It's a junkyard.

41
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,796
You can say that again.

42
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,924
I'm gonna keep talking.
Somebody lured Chicklet here
this morning and killed him.

43
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,094
There was a witness, however-
A homeless man.

44
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,468
He saw the whole thing.
Where is he?

45
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,099
We lost him.
He flagged down a patrol car
and then he disappeared.

46
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,109
But we got his name.
We'll find him.

47
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,304
Uh-oh.
What's up?

48
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,543
Oh, that car-
One headlight's not broken.

49
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,176
It's the only one not broken.

50
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,056
- Oh!
- Thank you.

51
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,287
Oh-

52
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,959
It's Karen. Yeah, Karen.
I gotta take this.
Hey, Randy?

53
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,830
<i>Hey, could you fill them in?</i>

54
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:05,064
Hey. Did you get my note?

55
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,833
- Oh, my God.
- Don't touch the body.
C.S.I. isn't here yet.

56
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,742
Okay, I won't touch the body.
He was bludgeoned.

57
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,246
Yeah. It looks like
with the barrel of a gun.
See these impressions?

58
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,512
If they had a gun,
why didn't they shoot him?

59
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,678
Yeah, that is a good question.
Wait. Look at this.

60
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:25,246
Victim's cellphone- Empty.

61
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,783
No memory, no address book.
Like it's been erased.

62
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:32,854
Could a stun gun do that?
Erase everything?

63
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,025
Yeah, maybe.

64
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,934
Yeah, I'll have the coroner
look for burn marks.

65
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,370
<i>Stun gun. That's good.</i>

66
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,533
You're good.

67
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,542
<i>Because I'm your husband,</i>

68
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,840
and that makes it my business.

69
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,745
No, Karen, you don't
want to talk about it?
You've gotta talk about it.

70
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,582
Karen? No, I'm not yelling.
I'm trying to-

71
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,214
Karen?

72
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:07,228
That's not cool, man.
You should treat her better.

73
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,538
- What did you say?
- Oh, I just- I don't really think
you appreciate her, you know?

74
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,539
She's a hell of a woman.

75
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,410
- Do I know you?
- No. No, you don't know me.

76
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,777
The question is,
do you know your wife?

77
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:25,284
- What's your name?
- Sharkey, sir.

78
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:28,081
Well, Sergeant Sharkey,
you're obviously trying
to tell me something.

79
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,918
Are you trying to tell me
that you know my wife?

80
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,924
Maybe I do.

81
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,994
You'd better wipe that smile
off your face.

82
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,395
Well, I don't know if I can do that.
Karen put it there.

83
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,330
- Okay. Okay, hold on.
- What's up?

84
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,199
Hey, guys. You can't fight here.
This is a crime scene.

85
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,003
You wanna take it down the street?
Let's go.
Oh, sure.

86
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,065
Yeah, that's how you
solve everything, isn't it?

87
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,543
Do you ever wonder what Karen's doing
on Tuesday nights?

88
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,445
You know, when you're
at your staff meetings?
Shut up. That's an order.

89
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,608
Take it from me, pal.
She ain't missing you.

90
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,015
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

91
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,111
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
All right. Okay.

92
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,122
I'm all right. It's okay.
All right.

93
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,852
Okay. I'm okay.
Just walk away from this.

94
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,589
Captain. Captain! Captain!

95
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,187
You maniac. Are you kidding?
Come on!

96
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,426
You knocked my tooth out. God!

97
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,128
What the hell's going on?
You heard what
the son of a bitch said to me.

98
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,262
- You maniac.
- Just call the paramedics.

99
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:23,138
Don't move. Nobody move.

100
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,700
- I'm going home.
- Captain, you're in charge.

101
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,712
Randy, get out of my way.

102
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,379
What the hell happened?
Monk, what happened?

103
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,220
I'm gonna need statements
from everybody.

104
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,164
Leland, what are you doing here?

105
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,865
Did something happen?

106
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,341
Now, that's a good question.

107
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,401
What did you do?

108
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,143
Did you turn the heat up?
It's like a sauna in here.

109
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,516
It's supposed to be 99 degrees exactly.
It's called the Gidamer method.

110
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,521
It's very therapeutic.

111
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,858
I can't breathe.

112
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,191
What happened to your hand?

113
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,597
I punched a cop.
You punched a cop?

114
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,692
Yeah. A sergeant.

115
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,704
- Ryan Sharkey.
- Why?

116
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,866
You don't know?

117
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,339
He said you and he
were having an affair.

118
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:38,349
And you believed him?
Leland, he is lying.

119
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,909
Why would he lie, Karen?
Why would anybody lie
about something like that?

120
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,718
Well, I don't know.
Maybe it was a joke.
You know, cop humor.

121
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,724
"I slept with your old lady.

122
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,022
Ha, ha, ha."

123
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,557
- So you're denying it?
- No, I'm not denying it.

124
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,295
<i>It's so crazy I won't</i>
<i>even respond to it.</i>

125
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,735
I can't believe we're even
talking about this.

126
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,637
Well, it sure would explain a lot.

127
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,641
Like what?
You know.

128
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,476
Like you sleeping in the guest room.

129
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,038
Because you've been snoring.

130
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,108
I didn't just start snoring, Karen.

131
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,785
And you forgetting our anniversary.

132
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:22,924
And you not wanting
to touch me anymore.

133
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,225
Leland, we have problems.

134
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,734
I'm not saying we don't,
but that isn't one of them-

135
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,270
Or at least, it wasn't.

136
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,603
You used to tie my neckties.

137
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,915
If he's convicted, Michael Karpov
is looking at 25 years to life,

138
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,855
which gives us motive
with a capital "M."

139
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,451
- That makes him suspect number one.
- What about physical evidence?

140
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,462
Unfortunately, there's not much.

141
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,363
Crime scene was contaminated
by two of our own.

142
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,596
<i>But that's the bad news.</i>
<i>The good news is,</i>
<i>there's a witness-</i>

143
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,603
A homeless man, a transient.

144
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,764
A homeless transient.

145
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,936
He's known as, uh, Jerry or Gerald,
35, maybe 40 years old.

146
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:15,606
If we can find him,
we can bring Karpov in
for a lineup.

147
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,149
Thank you, Lieutenant.
I'll take it from here.

148
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,777
Actually, sir, I'm in charge.

149
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,844
Says who?

150
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,823
Deputy chief.

151
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,555
I'm really sorry, sir.

152
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,667
Oh. Uh-

153
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:39,171
Carry on. I'll be in my office.

154
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,468
Wait a minute.
Why don't you keep the pointer?

155
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,569
I don't want the pointer, Randy.

156
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,579
You're doing a great job.

157
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,638
Carry on.
Oh, no. It's okay.

158
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,378
I can use my finger.
See? Look. Works just as well.

159
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,683
Even better. It bends.

160
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,690
Take the pointer, Randy.

161
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,028
All right. Let's get to work.

162
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,897
Careful. Both hands.
That's too high.

163
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:52,933
Oh, those things are death traps.
That's not just my opinion.
It's a fact.

164
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,038
Belgium, 1952, a kid almost
died on one of those.

165
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,640
There he is.
Where?

166
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,117
Where? That guy?

167
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,154
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Doesn't look like a drug dealer.</i>

168
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,622
<i>He's indicted for dealing.</i>
<i>He's guilty of a whole lot worse.</i>

169
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,754
Mr. Karpov, good morning.
Ah.

170
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,526
Got a minute?
Captain Stottlemeyer,
for you, any time.

171
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:17,228
Teddy, these men are policemen.

172
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,430
What do we do
when we see a policeman?

173
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,496
Aha. Very good. See?

174
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,769
I'm teaching him respect
for the law.

175
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:28,177
Chicklet has passed on.
Yes, I heard. Heartbreaking.

176
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,273
Hello. You have a little-
You have a smudge there.

177
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,285
I bet I can read your mind, Captain.
I'll get it.

178
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,617
<i>You want to know where I was</i>
<i>yesterday morning?</i>

179
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,782
That's right, about 6:00 a.m.

180
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,792
6:00 a.m. I was...

181
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,351
in bed with my beautiful wife,
where I belong.

182
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,132
Can you prove that?
That's not the question.

183
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,293
The question is,
can you prove I wasn't?

184
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,167
Do you own a stun gun,
Mr. Karpov?

185
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,834
What would I do with a gun?
I'm a businessman.
I import furniture.

186
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,434
Sure you do.
<i>And you are a very pretty lady.</i>

187
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:03,243
Perhaps I could sell you an end table,
hand-carved, from Estonia?

188
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,249
Then you would believe me.

189
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,547
Look.

190
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,986
<i>You're watching me.</i>
<i>The press is watching me.</i>

191
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:13,889
I would be a fool to sneak away
and do this thing.
And I am not a fool.

192
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,292
Either you did it,
or you hired somebody to do it.

193
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,730
You see that, Teddy?
That is what they call "speculation."

194
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,634
Something that the policemen do
when they're trying to scare you.

195
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,695
<i>Why don't you go play</i>
<i>with your friends?</i>

196
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,833
There was a witness, Michael-
a witness at the junkyard-

197
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,208
who saw everything.
Oh. What did he say?

198
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,043
"He"? How did you know
it was a man?

199
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:39,243
He just said it was a witness.

200
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:43,084
He, she- Doesn't hardly matter
because you are bluffing.

201
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,680
<i>If you had any witnesses,</i>
<i>then I would be down</i>
<i>at your station house...</i>

202
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:50,593
in one of your ridiculous lineups.
There's gonna be a lineup. Very soon.

203
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,491
Enjoy these moments
with your son, Michael.

204
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,503
Take lots of pictures.

205
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:02,735
Because you're not gonna
be seeing him for a very long time.

206
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,011
Oh, finally. I got it.

207
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,274
I think I'm sick.

208
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,249
Save yourselves. She's gonna blow!

209
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,786
It's gonna get ugly.

210
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,421
Listen, uh, I need a favor.

211
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,586
Karen's going out this afternoon.
She says she's going
to the movies.

212
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:27,428
I want you to follow her.
Oh, Captain, no.

213
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,729
You said
she denied everything.
She did.

214
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:33,363
That sergeant was just joking around.
He was just trying to impress
his idiot friends.

215
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,373
I don't think so.

216
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:39,036
Karen and me-
We don't even fight anymore.

217
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,102
Last week she said she was
at her friend's house.

218
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,114
I called there.
She wasn't there.

219
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,116
Week before that
it was the same thing.

220
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,209
Leland, don't ask me
to do this.

221
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,083
Monk, I really need to know.

222
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,145
I'd do it myself,

223
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:55,319
but the chief says I need to go
to this anger management class,
which really pisses me off.

224
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,794
I knocked out a tooth.
One tooth.

225
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,889
It's not like I killed the guy.
Who was that clown?
I've never seen him before.

226
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,298
Ryan Sharkey, Jr.
He was a motorcycle cop.

227
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,633
He just transferred in
from Mendocino.

228
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,264
- Wait. You pulled his file?
- You bet I did.

229
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,331
He's a real hotshot.

230
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,845
Has a couple of big arrests.
He's been cited for bravery twice.

231
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,405
And I hear he's
a real ladies' man.
You want some advice?

232
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,474
Forget what he said.
Just forget it.

233
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,078
Go home and hug your wife.
I don't want any more advice.

234
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:26,352
I wanna know where
Karen is going this afternoon.

235
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,258
What if she sees us?
She's gonna know that you
asked us to follow her.

236
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,024
- Wouldn't that be worse?
- Worse than not knowing?

237
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,692
Isn't it killing you, not knowing
what happened to Trudy?

238
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,863
How many times
have I asked you for a favor?

239
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,170
103.
Counting this, 104.

240
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,844
How many times
have I said "please"?

241
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,809
Okay.

242
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,897
Okay, here's how
you follow someone.

243
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,235
Stay at least 40 feet back.

244
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,002
Not more than 60.

245
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,241
And, whenever possible,

246
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,912
try to use reflective surfaces.

247
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,582
"Reflective surfaces"?

248
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,032
Yeah. See? Very discreet.

249
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,695
Reflective surfaces. What-

250
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,761
Wait a minute. I lost her.
Where'd she go?

251
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,706
Okay, would this be considered
a reflective surface?

252
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:53,336
Yeah. Mirrors-
Mirrors are good too.

253
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,548
<i>Oh, this isn't good.</i>
<i>What is that?</i>

254
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,779
<i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>
<i>She's going. She's going.</i>

255
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,255
Wait a second.
What is that on my collar?
Come on!

256
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,428
Okay, come on.

257
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,191
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on.

258
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,565
I hate this.
Yeah. I do too.

259
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,366
How long
have they been married?
Forever.

260
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,465
<i>Karen and Leland-</i>
<i>And they've never had</i>
<i>one thing in common.</i>

261
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,510
I remember,

262
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,739
this one weekend he went hunting...

263
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,078
and she stayed home...

264
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,880
and organized a rally
for stronger gun control.

265
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,315
It's hard when people
get married that young, you know?

266
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,448
<i>They get older.</i>
<i>They change.</i>

267
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:43,393
Yeah, not me.
I know not you, but people.

268
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,390
Come on.
Go, go, go, go, go.

269
00:17:56,942 --> 00:18:00,639
What is- Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Okay, Mr. Monk. Come on.

270
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,703
She's getting away.
But you can't just
leave her like this.

271
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,272
It's a mannequin.

272
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,477
Why do you say things like that?
Oh-

273
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,521
Oh, no.

274
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,897
So we're at her favorite
restaurant, okay?

275
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:25,528
And I'm spending, like,
a whole week's paycheck
on this one dinner.

276
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,072
And then this jerk
at the table next to me...

277
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,131
keeps yappin' on his cellphone.

278
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,871
I hate those cellphones.

279
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,879
<i>You can't have</i>
<i>a decent conversation anymore.</i>

280
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,279
Did you say your affirmations?
<i>Yes. Yes, I did.</i>

281
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,614
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, I tried. I really did.

282
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,450
I said, "Please.
We're trying to enjoy our dinner."

283
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,889
And then his cellphone rang again,
and I guess I lost it.

284
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,984
I threw a plate.

285
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,053
<i>A couple of plates.</i>

286
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,002
Excuse me.

287
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,569
Yeah?

288
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,138
Uh-huh?

289
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,481
Well, look, I can't talk right now, okay?
I'll call you later.

290
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,249
Leland, would you mind
turning that off?

291
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,552
I can't. I'm on duty.

292
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,220
- So what are you, a cop?
- That's right.

293
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,059
You think you're better than me
because you're a cop?

294
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,122
No, Peter,

295
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,431
I think I'm better than you
on general principle.

296
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:35,269
Well, at least I have some rough idea
of where my wife is.

297
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,940
Leland. Leland, look at me. Look.

298
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,105
Look at me.

299
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,410
Say your affirmation.
I want to hear it.

300
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:51,914
These things happen.

301
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,924
Say it again.

302
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,927
These things happen.

303
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,986
Sit down.

304
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,968
These things happen.
Mm-hmm.

305
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,301
Leland is angry, which is what?

306
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,306
A feeling.
That's right.

307
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,899
Anger is just a feeling.

308
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,775
Leland, you don't have
to act on your feelings.

309
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:17,576
You're an adult.
You can choose how you wanna respond.

310
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,583
You're absolutely right.

311
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,710
I'm gonna give you something.

312
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,984
It's a backup plan in case
you're out in the world
and you're in a situation,

313
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,618
and your affirmation is not working.

314
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:33,222
It's a fact-
You can't stay mad at anybody
when you're playing with a yo-yo.

315
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,823
I want you to take this with you.

316
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,166
I don't think so.

317
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,200
You understand-
If I don't sign your certificate
of completion,

318
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,542
you're gonna be with us
for another six weeks.

319
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,188
Thank you.

320
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,333
How's that feel?
It feels great.

321
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,028
Good.
Thank you.

322
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,201
Leland- Leland, you don't
have to do it that fast.

323
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,039
Yes, I do.

324
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,788
All right. Well, I checked everywhere.

325
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,950
There's no movie theater
in this mall,
so she lied about that.

326
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,460
Uh-huh.
Oh, there she goes.

327
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,553
<i>Mr. Monk, we gotta go.</i>

328
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,461
Uh-huh. Look-Yeah.

329
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:44,696
- <i>Ten dollars and three cents-</i>
<i>That's how much is in there.</i>
- Okay. Thank you. Now we know.

330
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,500
Yeah. I think we should make it even.
What are you talking about?

331
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,506
The fountain.

332
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:52,839
If we take out three cents,
then it'll be $10.

333
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,902
It's a nice round number, $10.

334
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,914
Then everyone'll be happier.

335
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,246
You always say that.
Who is "everyone"?

336
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,849
Me- Me.

337
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,789
You want me to reach in here
and take out three pennies?
Would you mind?

338
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,883
Yes, I would.
Look, look. She's moving again.
We gotta go.

339
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,724
Mr. Monk, if we walk now,
we won't even think
about the fountain.

340
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,766
I'll think about it.
It would haunt me.

341
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,427
The three extra pennies-
It would haunt you?

342
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,269
It would haunt me.

343
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,109
There! Okay?

344
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,119
Okay.

345
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:46,090
<i>My God. She really is</i>
<i>seeing somebody.</i>

346
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:49,793
No, the poor captain.
Is it Ryan Sharkey?

347
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,733
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I can't see his face.</i>

348
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:54,067
I'll try to get closer.

349
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,073
<i>Excuse me.</i>

350
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,166
Did you just take money
from that fountain?

351
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:01,235
No.
Ma'am?

352
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:04,942
Well, yeah, I mean-
We were making it even.

353
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,484
Come with me, please.
I just need to get a shot.

354
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:11,044
I don't want any trouble.
Just come with me.
You too.

355
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,649
<i>Get the shot.</i>

356
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:25,128
"A thousand seemingly unrelated facts...

357
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,467
"were coming together in Mark's mind...

358
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,167
"to form an undeniable truth,

359
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,836
"a picture of absolute clarity,

360
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,108
"where before there had been confusion.

361
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:39,173
"'What do you know?'Jesse asked him.

362
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,277
"'I know how Winston Brant was killed,'
Mark said,

363
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,845
'and I know who did it."'

364
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,857
Can you believe it?

365
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,018
What kind of degenerate tears out
the last two pages...

366
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,619
of a <i>Diagnosis Murder</i> mystery book?

367
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,900
What are you doing?

368
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:04,100
What are you doing?

369
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,111
I'm not gonna say anything.
I promise.

370
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,670
Sorry, Gerald.

371
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,336
It's the captain calling again.
Don't answer it.

372
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,039
We can't avoid him forever.
We've got to try.

373
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,047
Gerald Vengal?

374
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,208
Hi. I'm Lieutenant Disher,
San Francisco Police.

375
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,377
This is Adrian Monk
and Natalie Teeger.

376
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,546
Hi.
<i>How you feelin'?</i>

377
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,556
Like I got dropped out
of a three-story window.

378
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:57,721
Luckily I fell on a triple-corrugated
G.E. refrigerator box.

379
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:02,358
That's a excellent box.
If you gotta fall on a box,
try and make it a G.E. triple-corrugated.

380
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,402
Well, I'll keep that in mind.

381
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,460
Monk, questions.
Yes. Yes.

382
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:09,006
Mr. Vengal- Gerald-

383
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,599
do you have any idea,
approximately,

384
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,010
when you'll be finished chewing
on that piece of meat?

385
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:20,415
Sorry. It's been a long time
since I had a real meal.

386
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,545
Listen, you guys gotta help me
get out of here.

387
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,556
It's okay.
You're perfectly safe.

388
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,717
There's two policemen stationed
right outside the door.

389
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,784
No, it's not me.
I'm worried about Devo.

390
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,921
Who's Devo?

391
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,737
Oh.
Mouse. Mouse! Mouse!

392
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:43,865
I fell on the box and Devo fell on me.

393
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,536
If the doctors find him,
I don't know what they're gonna do.

394
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,808
Hospitals hate rodents.
They're like fanatics about it.

395
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,647
- We'll take care of Devo for you,
I promise.
- He's actually kind of cute.

396
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,050
Natalie, don't touch him.

397
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,988
Later on, if we have time,
I'll tell you a little story...

398
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,048
about the Black Plague.

399
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:03,890
He's not an ordinary mouse.
He's a genius.
He does impressions.

400
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:08,160
Watch. Devo, look at me.
Do a gerbil.

401
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:12,499
<i>Uh, be a gerbil.</i>
<i>He's shy, but he'll do it.</i>

402
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,972
<i>Come on, boy, you can do it.</i>
<i>Yeah, go on. You can do it.</i>
<i>Do the gerbil.</i>

403
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,669
There it is.

404
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:22,406
<i>Did you see that?</i>
Yeah. It's uncanny.
He's like Robert De Niro.

405
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,144
<i>Mr. Vengal, uh, those two</i>
<i>burn marks on your neck-</i>

406
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:30,085
- Did he attack you with a stun gun?
- Yes, sir.

407
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,282
- And you got a good look at him?
- Oh, I sure did.

408
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:35,087
I'll never forget that face
if I live to be 40.

409
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,822
And you're sure it was
the same guy that you saw
before in the junkyard?

410
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:41,525
- Definitely. The same guy.
- Mr. Vengal, we think we know
who did this.

411
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,625
His name is Michael Karpov.

412
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,193
I'd like to bring you down
to the station house later today-

413
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,967
So you can take a good look at him.
We'll set up a lineup.

414
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,441
Mr. Vengal, how we feeling today?

415
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,046
- You finished with this?
- Mm-hmm.

416
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,947
All right, I'm gonna take your pulse.

417
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:18,658
<i>I'm sorry, folks,</i>
<i>but visiting hours are over.</i>
<i>He needs his rest.</i>

418
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,898
Thank you.

419
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,907
- Are you okay?
- Fine.

420
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,136
My shoulder's a little sore.

421
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:31,112
Mr. Vengal, good to see you.

422
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,013
Captain?
Hey.

423
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,889
I've been calling you guys all day.
Have you been avoiding me?

424
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,928
Yes, we have.

425
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:21,796
We were waiting
till we could print this for you.

426
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,636
She's seeing somebody.

427
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:39,309
I knew it. Who is it?

428
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,284
We never saw his face.

429
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:44,412
Well, is this the only
photograph you got?

430
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:48,152
Well, we sort of got arrested.
It's a funny story.

431
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,160
- I don't want to hear it.
- No, it's really funny.

432
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,492
I really don't want to hear it.

433
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,759
- That's Sharkey, isn't it?
- I don't think so.

434
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,960
You look at the shape
of his left ear-

435
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,833
I don't want to hear about
the shape of the man's ear, Monk!

436
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:03,169
It's him. I can tell.

437
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,314
These things happen.

438
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:17,148
These things happen.
These things happen.

439
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,894
Screw it.

440
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,398
Guys, I've got a lineup downstairs
in five minutes.

441
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,874
I need to fill it out. Volunteers?

442
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,682
- Fine. Prichert, how tall are you?
- 5'10".

443
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,584
Good. You just volunteered.
You're one.
Mr. Karpov, you're two.

444
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:53,215
I don't need your court order.
You're just wasting
everybody's time.

445
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,953
Yeah, we'll see.
Landau, you're three.

446
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,723
- What's wrong with me?
- Sorry, Harry.

447
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,061
You're... too short.

448
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,227
That's funny.

449
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,897
That's funny.
Nolte, you're four.
I need one more.

450
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,771
Sharkey, you're in the lineup.
You're five.
Not me, Lieutenant.

451
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:15,335
I just finished a double shift.
I'm not asking you.

452
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:19,008
All right, let's go.
Let's do this.

453
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,074
Come on.

454
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:32,627
Gerald, this is Mr. Hoffman
from the District Attorney's office.

455
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,722
Now just relax.

456
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,291
That's one-way glass.
They won't even know you're here.

457
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:41,236
You ready?
Yeah.

458
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,240
Okay, send 'em in.

459
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,072
That-That's him. That's the guy.

460
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:54,277
You recognize him,
don't you, Devo?
H-He-

461
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,286
Wait. Whoa.
Don't say anything.

462
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,379
We have to do this
by the book.

463
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,390
We have to wait
till they all step forward.

464
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:06,092
Hey, you know where
Ryan Sharkey's at?

465
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,189
He's downstairs in a lineup.

466
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:14,271
Number two, step forward.

467
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,211
Turn to your left.

468
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,659
Thank you.

469
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,861
Number three, step forward.

470
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,170
Is that you?
You're pathetic.

471
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,304
Thank you.
Number four, step forward.

472
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,758
Number three, please put
the yo-yo away.

473
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,865
Number four, turn to your right.

474
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,202
Thank you.

475
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,795
What's your problem, bud?

476
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,273
You're my problem!

477
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,708
Number four, please let go
of number three.

478
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,769
Number five, stop kicking.

479
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,341
Number two, step forward.
Ouch.

480
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:36,046
Number three, please
let go of number four
and step forward.

481
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:40,854
Ow.
How's it going?

482
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:43,450
Please stop. Stop. Stop, please.

483
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,325
Please let go
of number three.
Whoa, Sergeant.

484
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:55,804
W-Wait. He's in there.
The killer's in there.

485
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:59,707
I'm sure he is, Mr. Vengal,
but it doesn't matter.
The lineup is busted.

486
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,717
That might have been
the worse lineup...

487
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:09,753
in the history
of law enforcement.

488
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,585
Yeah, it wasn't exactly
textbook, was it?

489
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,217
Captain, what should I do?

490
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:19,093
You do your job, Randy.
You write it up exactly
as it happened.

491
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,256
Don't worry about me.

492
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,495
Hey, where's Karpov?
We had to let him go.

493
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,094
Sergeant, sit down.

494
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,105
I'm gonna need a statement
from you too.

495
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:32,939
Leland. Natalie called to tell me
that you've been fighting again.

496
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,845
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- Uh, yeah, I'm okay.

497
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:39,940
Why don't you ask
about your boyfriend?

498
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:45,012
- Hi, Karen.
- Leland, I've never seen that man
before in my life.

499
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,887
Karen, you can stop pretending.

500
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,893
Now you're just insulting me.

501
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,256
Karen, would you just tell him?

502
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:56,095
Leland- I know you want to kill me.

503
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,101
I'd probably feel the same way,
all right?

504
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:01,195
But you gotta understand, whatever
happened between Karen and I...

505
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:03,206
didn't mean anything.

506
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,401
All right?
It was a mistake.

507
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:08,468
I'm sorry. I'm apologizing to you.

508
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:12,380
Who are you?
Leland, he must be crazy.

509
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,817
<i>Karen, it was fun.</i>
<i>You gotta face the music.</i>

510
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,821
It's over between us, okay?

511
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,983
- Okay, I don't know him.
You've got to believe me.
- Do I?

512
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,459
Yes, you do.
You have to believe me.

513
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,553
Why would he-
Why would he lie, Karen?

514
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,996
<i>Why would he say these things?</i>
Excuse me.

515
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:32,901
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Are you chewing that apple
on your left side?

516
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,904
Yeah. So?
Why?

517
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:38,271
Why? Because your friend
knocked my tooth out
two days ago, remember?

518
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,606
Yes, I remember.

519
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:43,112
But he didn't hit you
on this side.

520
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,115
The captain is right-handed.

521
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,117
He hit you on the other side.
Your left side.

522
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:50,780
- The side-
The side you're chewing on.
- Okay.

523
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:57,955
- The captain didn't
knock your tooth out, did he?
- What, are you crazy?

524
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,963
I'm remembering a few other things.

525
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,829
You-You used to work
in Mendocino, right?

526
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,599
When we saw
Michael Karpov in the park,
his son was wearing a shirt-

527
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:10,539
<i>It said "Mendocino Day School."</i>

528
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,803
Michael Karpov lives
in Mendocino.

529
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,936
Yeah, a lot of people
live in Mendocino.

530
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,446
- I don't know Michael Karpov.
- I think you do.

531
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:21,076
Ten minutes ago downstairs
you were wearing
those clothes,

532
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:23,382
and Karpov called you Sergeant.

533
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,581
That's right.
I heard that too.

534
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,557
How did he know
you were a sergeant, Sergeant?

535
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,151
This is Disher.
Is Gerald Vengal still in the building?

536
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,891
You work for Michael Karpov.

537
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:37,992
We always suspected
there was a cop
on his payroll.

538
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:42,062
You killed Chicklet, didn't you?
That's why you didn't
shoot him-

539
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,008
Because you knew the bullet
could be traced back to your weapon.
Here's what happened.

540
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:50,013
<i>You lured Chicklet to the junkyard,</i>
<i>but he fought back.</i>

541
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,481
<i>He must have hit you.</i>
<i>You were bleeding.</i>

542
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,848
<i>You lost a tooth,</i>
<i>and you had a big problem.</i>

543
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:58,377
<i>Your DNA was all over</i>
<i>that crime scene.</i>

544
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:01,983
<i>The cops were on their way.</i>
<i>You didn't have time</i>
<i>to clean it up.</i>

545
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:06,195
<i>You put your uniform on,</i>
<i>you returned to the scene,</i>

546
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,562
<i>but you knew Forensics</i>
<i>would be there any minute.</i>
<i>What to do?</i>

547
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:12,432
What to do?
Then you had an idea.

548
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:17,335
I'm your husband.
That makes it my business, okay?

549
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,899
<i>If you picked a fight with someone-</i>

550
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:23,003
<i>if you could provoke them</i>
<i>and get them to hit you,</i>

551
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,275
<i>you'd be home free.</i>

552
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,546
<i>They could find your tooth,</i>
<i>your DNA, your blood-</i>

553
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:33,022
- You knocked my tooth out. God.
- and nobody would ever question it.

554
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,718
You told my husband
we were sleeping together
so that he would hit you?

555
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,727
Oh, come-Would you-

556
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,025
You can't prove any of this.
I think we can.

557
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:42,031
We can connect you to Karpov.

558
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,693
We'll pull your phone bills,
your e-mails, your bank accounts-

559
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,135
Yeah, I think you might need
a little more than that.

560
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,571
That's the guy.
I've been telling you guys all day.

561
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,905
I saw him at the junkyard.
That's the guy.

562
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:56,276
Oh. Uh, hey, are you done with that?

563
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,084
It's not for me.

564
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,552
- It's for Devo.
- Mm-hmm.

565
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,986
Mm-hmm.
He's had a pretty rough day.

566
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,491
That mouse was in my pocket.

567
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:13,486
He was in my pocket.

568
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,269
<i>Let's go, Sharkey.</i>

569
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,449
Are you okay?

570
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,422
Heck of a thing, huh?

571
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:52,161
Actually, it's kind of flattering,
if you think about it.

572
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,797
He picked me because he knew
that I would react-

573
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:58,307
'cause he could tell
how much I love you.

574
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,970
It's not flattering, Leland.

575
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,479
Look, Karen, I know
that I've got a temper,

576
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:06,277
but I've been working on it.

577
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,046
I've got a yo-yo.

578
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,680
Actually, the yo-yo broke
when I threw it at the guy.

579
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:13,656
Why didn't you believe me?

580
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,388
I had Monk follow you
yesterday afternoon.

581
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,557
He saw you meeting a man.
You had me followed?

582
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,468
You wanna tell me about him?

583
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,875
His name is Max Tepperton.

584
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,881
He's a divorce lawyer.

585
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,714
You've been sleeping
with a divorce lawyer?

586
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:49,051
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

587
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:51,686
Because I forgive you, Karen.

588
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:55,323
Hell, I'm no saint.
We'll get past this.

589
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,333
No, Leland.

590
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:07,676
He's representing me.

591
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:20,086
<i>"Stottlemeyer versus Stottlemeyer."</i>

592
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,128
Why?

593
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,255
Because you have to ask why, Leland.

594
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,568
That's why.

595
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,092
So is that it?
Yeah.

596
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,227
Twenty years, two suitcases.

597
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,237
Where are the boys?

598
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:12,908
They're with Karen...
at her sister's.

599
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,969
How they doing?

600
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,071
Not good.

601
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:22,449
Listen, Captain,
if you need somebody
to talk to-

602
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,683
Here. Just call any time,
about anything,

603
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,350
even in the middle
of the night.
Monk, I know your number.

604
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,486
No, it's not me.
This is Natalie's home phone.

605
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,860
She's really good.

606
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,865
He's right. Any time.

607
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:39,362
Thanks.

608
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,031
Well, you know the old saying.
"When God closes a door"-

609
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,405
Yeah, "When God closes a door,

610
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:48,775
sometimes he breaks your heart."

611
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:51,610
That's not the old saying.

612
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:53,877
It is today.
