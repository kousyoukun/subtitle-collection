What's your problem? It's your<br>
favorite. Almonds and raisins.
<SYNC Start=17540><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=17799><P Class=ENCC>
Fine, don't eat.
<SYNC Start=19500><P Class=ENCC>
But I'm warning you.<br>
That's it for the rest of the day.
<SYNC Start=21502><P Class=ENCC>
Don't be complaining later.
<SYNC Start=23766><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, hey.<br>
Come on.
<SYNC Start=25034><P Class=ENCC>
You're crazy.<br>
You know that? You're nuts.
<SYNC Start=28225><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=28554><P Class=ENCC>
Quiet.<br>
Be as quiet as a you-know-what.
<SYNC Start=32025><P Class=ENCC>
This is so bogus.<br>
I'm not wearing a wire.
<SYNC Start=34962><P Class=ENCC>
Turn around.<br>
I should be frisking you, man.
<SYNC Start=37860><P Class=ENCC>
- Yeah?<br>
- Yeah.
<SYNC Start=40329><P Class=ENCC>
- Why were you talking to the DA?<br>
- They came to me.
<SYNC Start=42750><P Class=ENCC>
- What was I supposed to do?<br>
- Did you roll over? / No.
<SYNC Start=45745><P Class=ENCC>
- I didn't tell them anything.<br>
- Did you roll over? / No.
<SYNC Start=49118><P Class=ENCC>
I swear to god. I didn't tell them<br>
anything. You know me.
<SYNC Start=53143><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, I know you,<br>
And you're making me nervous.
<SYNC Start=54892><P Class=ENCC>
You know what, not just me.<br>
You're making everybody nervous.
<SYNC Start=59134><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=129996><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, there's a man in there.
<SYNC Start=132083><P Class=ENCC>
He was chasing me.<br>
I think he killed someone.
<SYNC Start=134450><P Class=ENCC>
Stay back here.<br>
We'll take a look.

Monk.
<SYNC Start=206203><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=207683><P Class=ENCC>
Natalie.<br>
Thanks for getting here so fast.
<SYNC Start=209996><P Class=ENCC>
- This is not an appliance store.<br>
- Yeah, I know.
<SYNC Start=213208><P Class=ENCC>
You said it was an appliance store.
<SYNC Start=214949><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sorry, I lied.<br>
But if I'd told you 
<SYNC Start=217254><P Class=ENCC>
it was a junkyard, it would've taken<br>
me 5 hours to get you down here.
<SYNC Start=220005><P Class=ENCC>
This is a junkyard.
<SYNC Start=221104><P Class=ENCC>
W..wait, so you lied to us?
<SYNC Start=222731><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sorry..<br>
This is a big case.
<SYNC Start=224557><P Class=ENCC>
It just went down.<br>
About 20 minutes ago.
<SYNC Start=226811><P Class=ENCC>
We've got a fresh crime<br>
scene for once.
<SYNC Start=228473><P Class=ENCC>
I wanted him here right away.
<SYNC Start=229977><P Class=ENCC>
I can't believe you lied to us.
<SYNC Start=231477><P Class=ENCC>
Look, I said I'm sorry.<br>
I think twice.
<SYNC Start=233080><P Class=ENCC>
How many times do I need<br>
to apologize?
<SYNC Start=234749><P Class=ENCC>
- 6.<br>
- 6.
<SYNC Start=236288><P Class=ENCC>
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
<SYNC Start=237953><P Class=ENCC>
Can we do this?
<SYNC Start=239556><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=240050><P Class=ENCC>
The victim was a small time<br>
drug dealer.
<SYNC Start=242658><P Class=ENCC>
Jimmy Botsdale.<br>
They called him Chicklet.
<SYNC Start=244588><P Class=ENCC>
He used to work for Michael Karpov.
<SYNC Start=246244><P Class=ENCC>
Karpov, I was just reading<br>
about that guy.
<SYNC Start=247834><P Class=ENCC>
Karpov is going on trial<br>
next month for criminal conspiracy
<SYNC Start=251500><P Class=ENCC>
and money laundering.<br>
I helped make the case.
<SYNC Start=253947><P Class=ENCC>
Chicklet was supposed to<br>
testify against him.
<SYNC Start=256217><P Class=ENCC>
Look at all this junk.
<SYNC Start=258149><P Class=ENCC>
They should get rid of it.<br>
And put it somewhere.
<SYNC Start=260473><P Class=ENCC>
Well, they did it, Mr. Monk.<br>
They put it here. It's a junkyard.
<SYNC Start=263507><P Class=ENCC>
- You can say that again.<br>
- I'm gonna keep talking.
<SYNC Start=265945><P Class=ENCC>
Somebody lured Chicklet here<br>
this morning and killed him.
<SYNC Start=268220><P Class=ENCC>
There was a witness however, a<br>
homeless man. He saw the whole thing.
<SYNC Start=271392><P Class=ENCC>
Well, where is he?
<SYNC Start=273300><P Class=ENCC>
We lost him. He flagged down a patrol<br>
car and then he disappeared.
<SYNC Start=276494><P Class=ENCC>
But we got his name.<br>
We'll find him. / Uh oh.
<SYNC Start=279760><P Class=ENCC>
- What's up?<br>
- That car.
<SYNC Start=281944><P Class=ENCC>
One headlight's not broken.<br>
It's the only one that's not broken.
<SYNC Start=287791><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=291769><P Class=ENCC>
Thank you.
<SYNC Start=293454><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=296178><P Class=ENCC>
It's Karen.
<SYNC Start=297604><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, Karen. I gotta take this.<br>
Hey, Randy.
<SYNC Start=300335><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, could you fill them in?
<SYNC Start=302632><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=303130><P Class=ENCC>
Hey. Did you get my note?
<SYNC Start=306515><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=306780><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, my god. / Don't touch the body.<br>
CSI isn't here yet.
<SYNC Start=309845><P Class=ENCC>
- Okay, I won't touch the body.<br>
- He was bludgeoned.
<SYNC Start=312960><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, looks like with<br>
the barrel of a gun.
<SYNC Start=314328><P Class=ENCC>
See these impressions?
<SYNC Start=315812><P Class=ENCC>
If they had a gun,<br>
why didn't they shoot him?
<SYNC Start=318603><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, that is a good question.
<SYNC Start=320760><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=321087><P Class=ENCC>
Look at this.<br>
Victim's cell phone.
<SYNC Start=324367><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=324653><P Class=ENCC>
Empty.
<SYNC Start=325968><P Class=ENCC>
No memory, no address book.<br>
Like it's been erased.
<SYNC Start=329868><P Class=ENCC>
Could a stun gun do that?
<SYNC Start=331723><P Class=ENCC>
Erase everything?
<SYNC Start=333386><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, maybe.
<SYNC Start=335088><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, I'll have the coroner<br>
look for burn marks.
<SYNC Start=338199><P Class=ENCC>
Stun gun.
<SYNC Start=340233><P Class=ENCC>
That's good.
<SYNC Start=342045><P Class=ENCC>
You're good.
<SYNC Start=343255><P Class=ENCC>
Because I'm your husband<br>
and that makes it my business.
<SYNC Start=348259><P Class=ENCC>
No, Karen, you don't want to talk<br>
about it? You gotta talk about it.
<SYNC Start=351887><P Class=ENCC>
Karen, No, I'm not yelling.<br>
I'm trying to..
<SYNC Start=355656><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=356225><P Class=ENCC>
Karen.
<SYNC Start=357966><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=364098><P Class=ENCC>
That's not cool, man.<br>
You should treat her better.
<SYNC Start=367285><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=369038><P Class=ENCC>
What did you say?<br>
Oh, I just..
<SYNC Start=370654><P Class=ENCC>
I don't really think you<br>
appreciate her.
<SYNC Start=372912><P Class=ENCC>
She's a..she's a hell of a woman.
<SYNC Start=376359><P Class=ENCC>
- Do I know you?<br>
- No. 
<SYNC Start=378110><P Class=ENCC>
No, you don't know me. The question<br>
is, do you know your wife?
<SYNC Start=382700><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=383074><P Class=ENCC>
- What's your name?<br>
- Sharkey, sir.
<SYNC Start=385712><P Class=ENCC>
Well, Sgt. Sharkey. You're obviously<br>
trying to tell me something.
<SYNC Start=388112><P Class=ENCC>
Are you trying to tell me<br>
that you know my wife?
<SYNC Start=391606><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe I do.
<SYNC Start=393751><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=394649><P Class=ENCC>
You'd better wipe that smile<br>
off your face.
<SYNC Start=396937><P Class=ENCC>
Well, I don't know if I can do that.<br>
Karen put it there.
<SYNC Start=400027><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.<br>
Hold on.
<SYNC Start=401478><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, you guys, you can't fight here.<br>
This is a crime scene.
<SYNC Start=406014><P Class=ENCC>
You wanna take it down the street?<br>
Let's go.
<SYNC Start=407694><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, sure, yeah. That's how<br>
you solve everything, isn't it?
<SYNC Start=410031><P Class=ENCC>
Do you ever wonder what<br>
Karen's doing on Tuesday nights?
<SYNC Start=412854><P Class=ENCC>
You know, when you're<br>
at the staff meeting..
<SYNC Start=414074><P Class=ENCC>
Whoa, Sergeant, shut up.<br>
That's an order.
<SYNC Start=415516><P Class=ENCC>
Take it from me, pal.<br>
She ain't missing you.
<SYNC Start=418291><P Class=ENCC>
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
<SYNC Start=420612><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=421023><P Class=ENCC>
All right.<br>
I'm okay. It's okay.
<SYNC Start=422959><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, I'm okay.
<SYNC Start=425436><P Class=ENCC>
Just walk away from this.
<SYNC Start=427424><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=429173><P Class=ENCC>
Captain.
<SYNC Start=430118><P Class=ENCC>
You maniac.<br>
What, are you kidding.
<SYNC Start=433100><P Class=ENCC>
You knocked my tooth out. God.
<SYNC Start=434833><P Class=ENCC>
What the hell's going on?
<SYNC Start=435981><P Class=ENCC>
Do you know what that son<br>
of a bitch said to me?
<SYNC Start=437362><P Class=ENCC>
- Maniac.<br>
- Just call the paramedics.
<SYNC Start=439642><P Class=ENCC>
Don't move.<br>
Nobody moves.
<SYNC Start=443361><P Class=ENCC>
- I'm going home.<br>
- Captain, you're in charge..
<SYNC Start=445617><P Class=ENCC>
Randy, get out of my way.
<SYNC Start=448274><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=449652><P Class=ENCC>
What the hell happened?
<SYNC Start=450928><P Class=ENCC>
Monk, what happened?
<SYNC Start=453993><P Class=ENCC>
I'm gonna need statements from everybody.
<SYNC Start=457830><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=468597><P Class=ENCC>
Leland, what are you doing here?
<SYNC Start=472569><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=473907><P Class=ENCC>
Did something happen?
<SYNC Start=475925><P Class=ENCC>
Now, that's a good question.
<SYNC Start=478227><P Class=ENCC>
What did you do?
<SYNC Start=479955><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=480624><P Class=ENCC>
Did you turn the heat up?
<SYNC Start=482767><P Class=ENCC>
It's like a sauna in here.
<SYNC Start=484537><P Class=ENCC>
Well, it's supposed to be<br>
99 degrees exactly.
<SYNC Start=486925><P Class=ENCC>
It's called the Gittomer method.
<SYNC Start=488566><P Class=ENCC>
It's very therapeutic.
<SYNC Start=491043><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=492201><P Class=ENCC>
I can't breathe.
<SYNC Start=495084><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=495659><P Class=ENCC>
What happened to your hand?
<SYNC Start=498221><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=498565><P Class=ENCC>
I punched a cop.
<SYNC Start=500246><P Class=ENCC>
- You punched a cop?<br>
- Yeah.
<SYNC Start=502817><P Class=ENCC>
A sergeant.<br>
Ryan Sharkey.
<SYNC Start=505790><P Class=ENCC>
Why?
<SYNC Start=508005><P Class=ENCC>
You don't know?
<SYNC Start=510716><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=512306><P Class=ENCC>
He said you and he were<br>
having an affair.
<SYNC Start=515315><P Class=ENCC>
And you believed him?<br>
Leland, he is lying.
<SYNC Start=518427><P Class=ENCC>
Why would he lie, Karen?
<SYNC Start=519607><P Class=ENCC>
Why would anybody lie<br>
about something like that?
<SYNC Start=521939><P Class=ENCC>
Well, I don't know.<br>
Maybe it was a joke.
<SYNC Start=523923><P Class=ENCC>
You know, cop humor.<br>
I slept with your old lady, ha ha ha.
<SYNC Start=530397><P Class=ENCC>
- So you're denying it.<br>
- No, I'm not denying it.
<SYNC Start=533717><P Class=ENCC>
It's so crazy I won't even<br>
respond to it.
<SYNC Start=536664><P Class=ENCC>
I can't believe we're even<br>
talking about this.
<SYNC Start=538994><P Class=ENCC>
It sure would explain a lot.
<SYNC Start=542077><P Class=ENCC>
- Like what?<br>
- You know.
<SYNC Start=545682><P Class=ENCC>
Like you sleeping in the guest room.
<SYNC Start=547766><P Class=ENCC>
Because you've been snoring.
<SYNC Start=550090><P Class=ENCC>
I didn't just start snoring, Karen.
<SYNC Start=554371><P Class=ENCC>
And you forgetting our anniversary.
<SYNC Start=559724><P Class=ENCC>
And you not wanting to<br>
touch me anymore.
<SYNC Start=563442><P Class=ENCC>
Leland, we have problems.<br>
I'm not saying we don't.
<SYNC Start=566760><P Class=ENCC>
But that isn't one of them.<br>
Or at least it wasn't.
<SYNC Start=573736><P Class=ENCC>
You used to tie my neckties.
<SYNC Start=577071><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=585148><P Class=ENCC>
If he's convicted, Michael Karpov<br>
is looking at 25 years to life
<SYNC Start=589250><P Class=ENCC>
which gives us motive with<br>
a capital m.
<SYNC Start=592559><P Class=ENCC>
That makes him suspect number one.
<SYNC Start=594029><P Class=ENCC>
What about physical evidence?
<SYNC Start=596237><P Class=ENCC>
Unfortunately there's not much.
<SYNC Start=598120><P Class=ENCC>
Crime scene was contaminated<br>
by two of our own.
<SYNC Start=601139><P Class=ENCC>
But that's a bad news.
<SYNC Start=602581><P Class=ENCC>
The good news is there's a witness,<br>
a homeless man,a transient.
<SYNC Start=606536><P Class=ENCC>
A homeless transient.
<SYNC Start=607877><P Class=ENCC>
He's known as Jerry or Gerald.<br>
35, maybe 40 years old.
<SYNC Start=612158><P Class=ENCC>
If we can find him, we can bring<br>
Karpov in for a lineup.
<SYNC Start=616068><P Class=ENCC>
Thank you, lieutenant,<br>
I'll take it from here.
<SYNC Start=619168><P Class=ENCC>
Actually, sir, I'm in charge.
<SYNC Start=621730><P Class=ENCC>
Says who?
<SYNC Start=623303><P Class=ENCC>
Deputy chief.
<SYNC Start=625644><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=629516><P Class=ENCC>
I'm really sorry, sir.
<SYNC Start=632523><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=633982><P Class=ENCC>
Oh. Um, 
<SYNC Start=637032><P Class=ENCC>
carry on, I'll be in my office.
<SYNC Start=639407><P Class=ENCC>
Wait, why don't you keep the pointer.
<SYNC Start=643388><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=644032><P Class=ENCC>
I don't want the pointer, Randy.<br>
You're doing a great job. Carry on.
<SYNC Start=648156><P Class=ENCC>
No, no, it's okay.<br>
I can use my finger.
<SYNC Start=650982><P Class=ENCC>
See, works just as well.
<SYNC Start=654335><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=654588><P Class=ENCC>
Even better, it bends.
<SYNC Start=657369><P Class=ENCC>
Take the pointer, Randy.
<SYNC Start=660598><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=669969><P Class=ENCC>
All right, let's get to work.
<SYNC Start=671955><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=706378><P Class=ENCC>
Careful, both your hands, that's too high.
<SYNC Start=708970><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=709419><P Class=ENCC>
These things are death traps.<br>
It's not just my opinion. It's a fact.
<SYNC Start=713191><P Class=ENCC>
In Belgium, 1952, a kid<br>
almost died on one of those.
<SYNC Start=716810><P Class=ENCC>
- There he is.<br>
- Where?
<SYNC Start=719100><P Class=ENCC>
- That guy?<br>
- Yep.
<SYNC Start=720588><P Class=ENCC>
Doesn't look like a drug dealer.
<SYNC Start=722034><P Class=ENCC>
He's indicted for dealing.<br>
He's guilty of a whole lot worse.
<SYNC Start=726736><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=727693><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Karpov. Good morning.
<SYNC Start=730148><P Class=ENCC>
- Ah.<br>
- Got a minute?
<SYNC Start=731587><P Class=ENCC>
Captain Stottlemeyer,<br>
for you any time.
<SYNC Start=734235><P Class=ENCC>
Teddy.<br>
These men are policemen.
<SYNC Start=737614><P Class=ENCC>
What do we do when we<br>
see a policeman?
<SYNC Start=739889><P Class=ENCC>
Ah ha, very good. See, I'm teaching<br>
him respect for the law.
<SYNC Start=744610><P Class=ENCC>
Chicklet has passed on.
<SYNC Start=746334><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, I heard.<br>
Heartbreaking.
<SYNC Start=748619><P Class=ENCC>
Hello, you have a little..<br>
You have a smudge there.
<SYNC Start=751440><P Class=ENCC>
- I bet I can read your mind, Captain.<br>
- I'll get it.
<SYNC Start=754162><P Class=ENCC>
You wanna know where I was<br>
yesterday morning.
<SYNC Start=757291><P Class=ENCC>
That's right, about 6 a.m.
<SYNC Start=759342><P Class=ENCC>
6 a.m., I was in bed with<br>
my beautiful wife where I belong.
<SYNC Start=765146><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=766606><P Class=ENCC>
- Can you prove that?<br>
- That's not the question.
<SYNC Start=768785><P Class=ENCC>
The question is can you<br>
prove I wasn't.
<SYNC Start=771000><P Class=ENCC>
Do you own a stun gun, Mr. Karpov?
<SYNC Start=773199><P Class=ENCC>
What would I do with a gun?
<SYNC Start=774861><P Class=ENCC>
I'm a businessman.
<SYNC Start=776454><P Class=ENCC>
- I import furniture.<br>
- So you do.
<SYNC Start=778021><P Class=ENCC>
And you are a very pretty lady.
<SYNC Start=780200><P Class=ENCC>
Perhaps I can sell you endtable,<br>
handcart from Estonia.
<SYNC Start=783420><P Class=ENCC>
Then you would believe me.
<SYNC Start=785504><P Class=ENCC>
Look, you're watching me,<br>
the press is watching me.
<SYNC Start=790297><P Class=ENCC>
I would be a fool to sneak away<br>
and do this thing.
<SYNC Start=792633><P Class=ENCC>
And I'm not a fool.
<SYNC Start=794688><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=794921><P Class=ENCC>
Either you did it or you<br>
hired somebody to do it.
<SYNC Start=797345><P Class=ENCC>
You see that, Teddy?
<SYNC Start=798737><P Class=ENCC>
That is what they call speculation.
<SYNC Start=801836><P Class=ENCC>
Somethig that the policemen<br>
do when they're trying to scare you.
<SYNC Start=805073><P Class=ENCC>
Why don't you go play<br>
with your friends?
<SYNC Start=807970><P Class=ENCC>
There was a witness, Michael.
<SYNC Start=809474><P Class=ENCC>
A witness at the junkyard.<br>
He saw everything.
<SYNC Start=812033><P Class=ENCC>
- Ah, what did he see?<br>
- He?
<SYNC Start=814016><P Class=ENCC>
How did you know it was a man?
<SYNC Start=816341><P Class=ENCC>
He just said a witness.
<SYNC Start=819614><P Class=ENCC>
He, she, doesn't hardly matter.<br>
Because you are bluffing.
<SYNC Start=823191><P Class=ENCC>
If you had any witnesses,
<SYNC Start=824649><P Class=ENCC>
then I would be down at your stationhouse<br>
in one of your ridiculous lineups.
<SYNC Start=827903><P Class=ENCC>
There's gonna be a lineup.<br>
Very soon.
<SYNC Start=832157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=834561><P Class=ENCC>
Enjoy these moments with<br>
your son, Michael.
<SYNC Start=837230><P Class=ENCC>
Take lots of pictures.
<SYNC Start=839003><P Class=ENCC>
Because you're not gonna be<br>
seeing him for a very long time.
<SYNC Start=844872><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=845754><P Class=ENCC>
Finally.<br>
I got it.
<SYNC Start=848097><P Class=ENCC>
I think I'm sick.
<SYNC Start=850551><P Class=ENCC>
Save yourselves.<br>
She's gonna blow.
<SYNC Start=853222><P Class=ENCC>
It's gonna be ugly.
<SYNC Start=855392><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=858275><P Class=ENCC>
Listen, um, I need a favor.<br>
Karen's going out this afternoon.
<SYNC Start=862523><P Class=ENCC>
She said she's going to the movies.
<SYNC Start=865035><P Class=ENCC>
I want you to follow her.
<SYNC Start=866446><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, Captain, no.
<SYNC Start=867788><P Class=ENCC>
- You said she denied everything.<br>
- She did.
<SYNC Start=869952><P Class=ENCC>
Captain, that sergeant was<br>
joking around.
<SYNC Start=871782><P Class=ENCC>
He was just trying to impress<br>
his idiot friends.
<SYNC Start=873324><P Class=ENCC>
I don't think so.
<SYNC Start=875330><P Class=ENCC>
Karen and me,<br>
we don't even fight anymore.
<SYNC Start=880060><P Class=ENCC>
Last week, she said she was<br>
at her friend's house.
<SYNC Start=882138><P Class=ENCC>
I called her, she wasn't there.
<SYNC Start=883478><P Class=ENCC>
Week before that,<br>
it was the same thing.
<SYNC Start=884841><P Class=ENCC>
Leland, don't ask me to do this.
<SYNC Start=887312><P Class=ENCC>
Monk, I really need to know.
<SYNC Start=890191><P Class=ENCC>
I'd do it myself, 
<SYNC Start=891247><P Class=ENCC>
but the chief says I need<br>
to go to this anger management class
<SYNC Start=894930><P Class=ENCC>
which really pisses me off.<br>
I knocked out a tooth, one tooth.
<SYNC Start=897539><P Class=ENCC>
It's not like I killed the guy.
<SYNC Start=898992><P Class=ENCC>
Who was that clown?<br>
I've never seen him before.
<SYNC Start=900884><P Class=ENCC>
Ryan Sharkey Jr.<br>
He was a motorcycle cop.
<SYNC Start=903914><P Class=ENCC>
He just transferred in from Mendocino.
<SYNC Start=905913><P Class=ENCC>
What, you pulled his file?
<SYNC Start=907290><P Class=ENCC>
You bet I did.
<SYNC Start=909193><P Class=ENCC>
He's a real hotshot.
<SYNC Start=910793><P Class=ENCC>
Has a couple of big arrests.<br>
He's been cited for bravery twice.
<SYNC Start=914900><P Class=ENCC>
And I hear he's a real lady's man.
<SYNC Start=916441><P Class=ENCC>
You want some advice?<br>
Forget what he said. 
<SYNC Start=918541><P Class=ENCC>
Just forget it.<br>
Go home and hug your wife.
<SYNC Start=920847><P Class=ENCC>
I don't want any more advice.
<SYNC Start=924195><P Class=ENCC>
I wanna know where Karen<br>
is going this afternoon.
<SYNC Start=926337><P Class=ENCC>
What if she sees us?
<SYNC Start=927504><P Class=ENCC>
She's gonna know that you<br>
asked us to follow her.
<SYNC Start=929329><P Class=ENCC>
Wouldn't that be worse?
<SYNC Start=930592><P Class=ENCC>
Worse than not knowing?
<SYNC Start=933385><P Class=ENCC>
?? killing you not knowing<br>
what happened to Trudy?
<SYNC Start=937050><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=937984><P Class=ENCC>
How many times have I asked<br>
you for a favor?
<SYNC Start=940522><P Class=ENCC>
103, counting this, 104.
<SYNC Start=944521><P Class=ENCC>
How many times have<br>
I said please?
<SYNC Start=949077><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=951804><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.
<SYNC Start=954187><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=968237><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, here's how you follow someone.
<SYNC Start=971062><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=972054><P Class=ENCC>
Stay at least 40 feet back.
<SYNC Start=974425><P Class=ENCC>
But not more than 60.
<SYNC Start=978200><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=982269><P Class=ENCC>
And whenever possible, try<br>
to use reflective surfaces.
<SYNC Start=989796><P Class=ENCC>
Reflective surfaces?
<SYNC Start=992152><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=999650><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, see? Very discreet.<br>
Reflective surfaces.
<SYNC Start=1005254><P Class=ENCC>
Wait a minute, I lost her.<br>
Where'd she go?
<SYNC Start=1006864><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, would this be considered<br>
a reflective surfaces?
<SYNC Start=1010012><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, well, mirrors.<br>
Mirrors are good, too.
<SYNC Start=1015082><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1017442><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, this isn't good.<br>
What is that?
<SYNC Start=1019585><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, come on, come on.
<SYNC Start=1020870><P Class=ENCC>
- She's going, she's going.<br>
- Wait a second.
<SYNC Start=1021942><P Class=ENCC>
- What is that on my collar?<br>
- Come on.
<SYNC Start=1024143><P Class=ENCC>
What is that?
<SYNC Start=1025670><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1029021><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, come on.
<SYNC Start=1030744><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1031511><P Class=ENCC>
No, no, no, no.
<SYNC Start=1034366><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1034904><P Class=ENCC>
- I hate this.<br>
- Yeah, I do, too.
<SYNC Start=1037663><P Class=ENCC>
How long have they been married?
<SYNC Start=1039408><P Class=ENCC>
Forever.<br>
Karen and Leland..
<SYNC Start=1041581><P Class=ENCC>
And they never had one thing<br>
in common.
<SYNC Start=1044788><P Class=ENCC>
I remember, this one weekend,<br>
he went hunting 
<SYNC Start=1049142><P Class=ENCC>
and she stayed home 
<SYNC Start=1051138><P Class=ENCC>
and organized<br>
a rally for stronger gun control.
<SYNC Start=1055117><P Class=ENCC>
It's hard when people get<br>
married that young, you know.
<SYNC Start=1057430><P Class=ENCC>
- You get older and change.<br>
- Yeah, not me.
<SYNC Start=1061019><P Class=ENCC>
Well, I know not you, but people.
<SYNC Start=1064694><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1065902><P Class=ENCC>
- Come on.<br>
- Go, go, go, go.
<SYNC Start=1068667><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1078091><P Class=ENCC>
Sorry.<br>
I'm so sorry.
<SYNC Start=1079220><P Class=ENCC>
It's okay.<br>
Mr. Monk, come on, come on.
<SYNC Start=1080267><P Class=ENCC>
- She's getting away.<br>
- But you can't just leave her like this.
<SYNC Start=1082679><P Class=ENCC>
It's a mannequin.
<SYNC Start=1084648><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1085369><P Class=ENCC>
- Why do you say things like that?<br>
- Oh.
<SYNC Start=1087652><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, no.
<SYNC Start=1089774><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1099799><P Class=ENCC>
So we're at her favorite<br>
restaurant, okay?
<SYNC Start=1102178><P Class=ENCC>
And I'm spending like a whole week's<br>
paycheck on this one dinner.
<SYNC Start=1106234><P Class=ENCC>
And then this jerk at the table next<br>
to me keeps yapping on his cell phone.
<SYNC Start=1110187><P Class=ENCC>
I hate those cell phones.
<SYNC Start=1112604><P Class=ENCC>
You can't have a decent<br>
conversation anymore.
<SYNC Start=1114745><P Class=ENCC>
- Did you say your affirmation?<br>
- Yes. Yes, I did. / Uh huh.
<SYNC Start=1118444><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, I tried.<br>
I really did.
<SYNC Start=1120929><P Class=ENCC>
I said, please, we're trying<br>
to enjoy our dinner.
<SYNC Start=1123842><P Class=ENCC>
And then his cell phone rang again.
<SYNC Start=1125683><P Class=ENCC>
And I guess I lost it.
<SYNC Start=1127526><P Class=ENCC>
I threw a plate.
<SYNC Start=1129795><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1130571><P Class=ENCC>
A couple of plates.
<SYNC Start=1133352><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1142316><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me.
<SYNC Start=1144779><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1147359><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah.
<SYNC Start=1149127><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1150129><P Class=ENCC>
Uh huh.
<SYNC Start=1151901><P Class=ENCC>
Look, I can't talk right now, Karen.<br>
I'll call you later.
<SYNC Start=1155762><P Class=ENCC>
Leland, would you mind<br>
turning that off?
<SYNC Start=1157505><P Class=ENCC>
I can't.<br>
I'm on duty.
<SYNC Start=1159514><P Class=ENCC>
So what are you, a cop?
<SYNC Start=1161947><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1162487><P Class=ENCC>
That's right.
<SYNC Start=1164224><P Class=ENCC>
You think you're better than me<br>
because you're a cop?
<SYNC Start=1166891><P Class=ENCC>
No, Peter, I think I'm better<br>
than you on general principle.
<SYNC Start=1172111><P Class=ENCC>
Well, at least I have some<br>
rough idea where my wife is.
<SYNC Start=1177636><P Class=ENCC>
Leland. Leland, look at me. Look.
<SYNC Start=1181096><P Class=ENCC>
Look at me.
<SYNC Start=1183219><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1184801><P Class=ENCC>
Say your affirmation.<br>
I wanna hear it.
<SYNC Start=1188795><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1189973><P Class=ENCC>
These things happen.
<SYNC Start=1191975><P Class=ENCC>
Say it again.
<SYNC Start=1194399><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1195319><P Class=ENCC>
These things happen.
<SYNC Start=1197384><P Class=ENCC>
Sit down.
<SYNC Start=1199636><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1200994><P Class=ENCC>
These things happen.
<SYNC Start=1203475><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1204395><P Class=ENCC>
Leland is angry.<br>
Which is what?
<SYNC Start=1207544><P Class=ENCC>
- A feeling.<br>
- That's right.
<SYNC Start=1209376><P Class=ENCC>
Anger is just a feeling.
<SYNC Start=1212273><P Class=ENCC>
Leland, you don't have to act<br>
on your feelings. You're an adult.
<SYNC Start=1215739><P Class=ENCC>
You can choose how you<br>
wanna respond.
<SYNC Start=1217885><P Class=ENCC>
You're absolutely right.
<SYNC Start=1219400><P Class=ENCC>
I'm gonna give you something.
<SYNC Start=1221100><P Class=ENCC>
It's a backup plan in case you're<br>
out in the world and you're
<SYNC Start=1223723><P Class=ENCC>
in a situation and your affirmation<br>
is not working.
<SYNC Start=1228746><P Class=ENCC>
It's a fact.
<SYNC Start=1230201><P Class=ENCC>
You can't stay mad at anybody<br>
when you're playing with a yo-yo.
<SYNC Start=1233920><P Class=ENCC>
I want you to take this with you.
<SYNC Start=1237086><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1238813><P Class=ENCC>
I don't think so.
<SYNC Start=1241098><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1241670><P Class=ENCC>
You understand if I don't sign<br>
your certificate of completion,
<SYNC Start=1246335><P Class=ENCC>
you're gonna be with us<br>
for another 6 weeks.
<SYNC Start=1250204><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1256629><P Class=ENCC>
Thank you.
<SYNC Start=1259140><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1267825><P Class=ENCC>
- How's that feel?<br>
- It feels great.
<SYNC Start=1269323><P Class=ENCC>
- Good.<br>
- Thank you.
<SYNC Start=1271998><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1275492><P Class=ENCC>
Leland, Leland.<br>
You don't have to do it that fast.
<SYNC Start=1280401><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1282174><P Class=ENCC>
I guess I do.
<SYNC Start=1284196><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1289619><P Class=ENCC>
All right, well, I checked everywhere.
<SYNC Start=1290977><P Class=ENCC>
There's no movie theater in this mall,<br>
so she lied about that.
<SYNC Start=1293968><P Class=ENCC>
Ah ha.
<SYNC Start=1295809><P Class=ENCC>
There she goes.<br>
Mr. Monk, we gotta go.
<SYNC Start=1298301><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1298924><P Class=ENCC>
Ha ha, look, yeah.
<SYNC Start=1301099><P Class=ENCC>
10 dollars and three cents.<br>
That's how much is in there.
<SYNC Start=1303435><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, thank you.<br>
Now we know.
<SYNC Start=1304629><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, I think we should make it even.
<SYNC Start=1306996><P Class=ENCC>
What are you talking about?
<SYNC Start=1308383><P Class=ENCC>
The fountain.
<SYNC Start=1310289><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1310525><P Class=ENCC>
We take out three cents<br>
and that'll be 10 dollars.
<SYNC Start=1313821><P Class=ENCC>
It's a nice round number.<br>
10 dollars.
<SYNC Start=1315535><P Class=ENCC>
Then everyone would be happier.
<SYNC Start=1316897><P Class=ENCC>
You always say that.<br>
Who is everyone?
<SYNC Start=1320324><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1321155><P Class=ENCC>
Me.
<SYNC Start=1322672><P Class=ENCC>
Me.
<SYNC Start=1323527><P Class=ENCC>
You want me to reach in here<br>
and take out 3 pennies?
<SYNC Start=1325610><P Class=ENCC>
- Would you mind?<br>
- Yes, I would.
<SYNC Start=1327529><P Class=ENCC>
Look, look, she's moving again.<br>
We gotta go.
<SYNC Start=1329340><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Monk, if we walk now,
<SYNC Start=1330795><P Class=ENCC>
we won't even think<br>
about the fountain.
<SYNC Start=1332100><P Class=ENCC>
I'll think about it.
<SYNC Start=1333374><P Class=ENCC>
It would haunt me.
<SYNC Start=1334858><P Class=ENCC>
The three extra pennies.<br>
It would haunt you?
<SYNC Start=1338588><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1340020><P Class=ENCC>
It will haunt me.
<SYNC Start=1343185><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1351094><P Class=ENCC>
There.<br>
Okay?
<SYNC Start=1352806><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.
<SYNC Start=1354324><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1362675><P Class=ENCC>
My god.
<SYNC Start=1364064><P Class=ENCC>
She really is seeing somebody.
<SYNC Start=1365750><P Class=ENCC>
- Oh, no.<br>
- No. The poor captain.
<SYNC Start=1368360><P Class=ENCC>
Is it Ryan Sharkey?
<SYNC Start=1370674><P Class=ENCC>
I can't see his face.<br>
Try to get closer.
<SYNC Start=1374203><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me.
<SYNC Start=1376036><P Class=ENCC>
Did you just take money<br>
from that fountain?
<SYNC Start=1378172><P Class=ENCC>
No.
<SYNC Start=1379638><P Class=ENCC>
Ma'am.
<SYNC Start=1381641><P Class=ENCC>
Well, yeah, I mean..
<SYNC Start=1383095><P Class=ENCC>
We were making it even.
<SYNC Start=1385013><P Class=ENCC>
Come with me, please.
<SYNC Start=1386053><P Class=ENCC>
I just need to get a shot.
<SYNC Start=1387010><P Class=ENCC>
I don't want any trouble.<br>
Just come with me.
<SYNC Start=1389934><P Class=ENCC>
- Get the shots.<br>
- You, too.
<SYNC Start=1392678><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1393554><P Class=ENCC>
Get the shots.
<SYNC Start=1395431><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1403539><P Class=ENCC>
...seemingly unrelated facts 
<SYNC Start=1405707><P Class=ENCC>
coming together in Mark's mind<br>
to form an undeniable truth.
<SYNC Start=1410986><P Class=ENCC>
A picture of absolute clarity where<br>
before there had been confusion.
<SYNC Start=1416731><P Class=ENCC>
What do you know?<br>
Jesse asked him.
<SYNC Start=1419436><P Class=ENCC>
I know how Winston Brent<br>
was killed, Mark said.
<SYNC Start=1422637><P Class=ENCC>
And I know who did it.
<SYNC Start=1425372><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1425712><P Class=ENCC>
I cannot believe it. 
<SYNC Start=1426765><P Class=ENCC>
What kind of degenerate tears out<br>
the last two pages
<SYNC Start=1429093><P Class=ENCC>
of a Diagnosis Murder<br>
mystery book?
<SYNC Start=1432301><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1439693><P Class=ENCC>
What are you doing?
<SYNC Start=1442024><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1443526><P Class=ENCC>
What are you doing?
<SYNC Start=1444881><P Class=ENCC>
I..I..I'm not gonna say anything.<br>
I promise.
<SYNC Start=1448364><P Class=ENCC>
Sorry, Gerald.
<SYNC Start=1450343><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1477302><P Class=ENCC>
- Why is the Captain calling?<br>
- Don't answer it.
<SYNC Start=1479204><P Class=ENCC>
- Well, we can't avoid him for ever.<br>
- You've got to try.
<SYNC Start=1482620><P Class=ENCC>
Gerald Vingold? 
<SYNC Start=1483811><P Class=ENCC>
Hi, I'm Lieutenant Disher,<br>
San Francisco Police.
<SYNC Start=1486394><P Class=ENCC>
This is Adrian Monk,<br>
Natalie Teeger. / Hi.
<SYNC Start=1489246><P Class=ENCC>
How are you feeling?
<SYNC Start=1490666><P Class=ENCC>
Like I got dropped out<br>
of a 3-story window.
<SYNC Start=1493580><P Class=ENCC>
Luckily I fell on a triple corrugated<br>
GE refrigerator box.
<SYNC Start=1498281><P Class=ENCC>
It's an excellent box.
<SYNC Start=1499756><P Class=ENCC>
If you ever fall on a box,<br>
try to make it a GE triple corrugated.
<SYNC Start=1502420><P Class=ENCC>
Well, I'll keep that in mind.
<SYNC Start=1504346><P Class=ENCC>
Monk, questions?
<SYNC Start=1505800><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. Mr. Vingold, Gerald.
<SYNC Start=1509419><P Class=ENCC>
Do you have any idea approximately
<SYNC Start=1512850><P Class=ENCC>
when you'll be finished chewing<br>
on that piece of meat?
<SYNC Start=1517020><P Class=ENCC>
Sorry. It's been a long time since<br>
I had a real meal.
<SYNC Start=1521314><P Class=ENCC>
Listen, you guys gotta help<br>
me get out of here.
<SYNC Start=1524014><P Class=ENCC>
It's okay.<br>
You're perfectly safe.
<SYNC Start=1525855><P Class=ENCC>
There's two policemen<br>
stationed right outside the door.
<SYNC Start=1527923><P Class=ENCC>
It's not me.<br>
I'm worried about Devo.
<SYNC Start=1530920><P Class=ENCC>
Who's Devo?
<SYNC Start=1532940><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1540963><P Class=ENCC>
I fell on the box<br>
and Devo fell on me.
<SYNC Start=1544201><P Class=ENCC>
If the doctors find him,<br>
I don't know what they're gonna do.
<SYNC Start=1546538><P Class=ENCC>
Hospitals hate rodents.<br>
They're like fanatics about it.
<SYNC Start=1549999><P Class=ENCC>
We'll take care of Devo<br>
for you, I promise.
<SYNC Start=1551909><P Class=ENCC>
He's actually kinda cute.
<SYNC Start=1553229><P Class=ENCC>
Natalie, don't touch him.
<SYNC Start=1556286><P Class=ENCC>
Later on, when we have time, 
<SYNC Start=1557630><P Class=ENCC>
I'll tell you a little story<br>
about the Black Plague.
<SYNC Start=1561344><P Class=ENCC>
He's not an ordinary mouse.<br>
He's a genius. He does impressions.
<SYNC Start=1564599><P Class=ENCC>
Watch. Devo, look at me.<br>
Do a gerbil.
<SYNC Start=1568966><P Class=ENCC>
Be a gerbil. He's shy.<br>
But he'll do it.
<SYNC Start=1572542><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, boy, you can do it.<br>
Yeah, go on, you can do it.
<SYNC Start=1575153><P Class=ENCC>
Do the gerbil.
<SYNC Start=1577100><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1578128><P Class=ENCC>
Ah, there it is.<br>
Did you see that?
<SYNC Start=1579497><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. It's uncanny.<br>
He's like Robert DeNiro.
<SYNC Start=1582168><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, um, Mr.Vingold,<br>
those two burnmarks
<SYNC Start=1586099><P Class=ENCC>
on your neck, did he attack you<br>
with a stun gun? / Yes, sir.
<SYNC Start=1590419><P Class=ENCC>
- And you got a good look at him?<br>
- I sure did.
<SYNC Start=1592310><P Class=ENCC>
I'll never forget that face<br>
if I live to be 40.
<SYNC Start=1594992><P Class=ENCC>
And you're sure it was the same guy<br>
that you saw before in the junk yard?
<SYNC Start=1597762><P Class=ENCC>
Definitely.<br>
The same guy.
<SYNC Start=1599506><P Class=ENCC>
Mr.Vingold, we think<br>
we know who did this.
<SYNC Start=1602181><P Class=ENCC>
His name is Michael Karpov.
<SYNC Start=1604075><P Class=ENCC>
I'd like to bring you down<br>
to the station house later today, 
<SYNC Start=1606487><P Class=ENCC>
so you can take a good look at him.<br>
We'll set a lineup.
<SYNC Start=1609358><P Class=ENCC>
Mr.Vingold, how are we feeling today?
<SYNC Start=1613357><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1614325><P Class=ENCC>
You finished with this?
<SYNC Start=1616303><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1617108><P Class=ENCC>
Right, I'm gonna take your pulse.
<SYNC Start=1620490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1635459><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sorry, golks,<br>
but visiting hours are over.
<SYNC Start=1637815><P Class=ENCC>
- He needs his rest.<br>
- Thank you.
<SYNC Start=1640619><P Class=ENCC>
- Are you okay?<br>
- Fine.
<SYNC Start=1643774><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1644130><P Class=ENCC>
My shoulder's a little sore.
<SYNC Start=1646904><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1648875><P Class=ENCC>
Mr.Vingold, good to see you.
<SYNC Start=1652347><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1691307><P Class=ENCC>
- Captain.<br>
- Hey.
<SYNC Start=1693155><P Class=ENCC>
I've been calling you guys all day.<br>
Have you been avoiding me?
<SYNC Start=1695906><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, we have.
<SYNC Start=1697987><P Class=ENCC>
We were waiting till we could<br>
print this for you.
<SYNC Start=1702834><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1713384><P Class=ENCC>
She's seeing somebody.
<SYNC Start=1715739><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1716183><P Class=ENCC>
I knew it.
<SYNC Start=1718184><P Class=ENCC>
Who is it?
<SYNC Start=1719418><P Class=ENCC>
We never saw his face.
<SYNC Start=1721882><P Class=ENCC>
Is this any way to photograph a guy?
<SYNC Start=1725268><P Class=ENCC>
- We sort of got arrested.<br>
- It's a funny story.
<SYNC Start=1728515><P Class=ENCC>
- I don't wanna hear it.<br>
- No, it's really funny.
<SYNC Start=1729970><P Class=ENCC>
I really don't wanna hear it.
<SYNC Start=1732628><P Class=ENCC>
- It's Sharkey, isn't it?<br>
- I don't think so.
<SYNC Start=1735574><P Class=ENCC>
If you look at the shape of<br>
his left ear..
<SYNC Start=1737239><P Class=ENCC>
I don't wanna hear about<br>
the shape of the man's ear.
<SYNC Start=1739465><P Class=ENCC>
Monk, it's him.<br>
I can tell.
<SYNC Start=1742650><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1750286><P Class=ENCC>
These things happen.
<SYNC Start=1752835><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1753610><P Class=ENCC>
These things happen.
<SYNC Start=1755772><P Class=ENCC>
These things happen.
<SYNC Start=1758374><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1762098><P Class=ENCC>
Screw it.
<SYNC Start=1763994><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1774276><P Class=ENCC>
Guys, I've got a lineup downstairs<br>
in 5 minutes. I need to fill it out.
<SYNC Start=1777828><P Class=ENCC>
Volenteers?
<SYNC Start=1779708><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1783097><P Class=ENCC>
Fine.
<SYNC Start=1784334><P Class=ENCC>
- Richard, how tall are you?<br>
- Five ten.
<SYNC Start=1786449><P Class=ENCC>
Good, you just volunteered.<br>
You're one.
<SYNC Start=1788453><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Karpov, you're two.
<SYNC Start=1790055><P Class=ENCC>
I don't need your court order.<br>
You're just wasting everybody's time.
<SYNC Start=1793471><P Class=ENCC>
We will see.
<SYNC Start=1794810><P Class=ENCC>
- Landau, you're three.<br>
- What's wrong with me?
<SYNC Start=1798132><P Class=ENCC>
Sorry. You're too short.
<SYNC Start=1801960><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1804680><P Class=ENCC>
It's funny.<br>
It's funny.
<SYNC Start=1805839><P Class=ENCC>
Nolte, you're four.<br>
I need one more.
<SYNC Start=1809404><P Class=ENCC>
Sharkey, you're in the lineup.<br>
You're five.
<SYNC Start=1812249><P Class=ENCC>
Not me, lieutenant.<br>
I just finished the double shift.
<SYNC Start=1814095><P Class=ENCC>
I'm not asking you.
<SYNC Start=1816530><P Class=ENCC>
All right, let's go.<br>
Let's do this.
<SYNC Start=1818999><P Class=ENCC>
Come on.
<SYNC Start=1820923><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1828626><P Class=ENCC>
Gerald, this is Mr. Hoffman<br>
from the District Attorney's office.
<SYNC Start=1833373><P Class=ENCC>
Just relax.
<SYNC Start=1835131><P Class=ENCC>
It's one-way glass.<br>
They won't even know you're here.
<SYNC Start=1838318><P Class=ENCC>
- Ready?<br>
- Yeah.
<SYNC Start=1841165><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, send them in.
<SYNC Start=1843945><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1849529><P Class=ENCC>
That..that's him.<br>
That's the guy.
<SYNC Start=1851571><P Class=ENCC>
You recognize him,<br>
don't you, Devo?
<SYNC Start=1853723><P Class=ENCC>
- He..he's...<br>
- W..wait.
<SYNC Start=1855418><P Class=ENCC>
Don't say anything.<br>
We have to do this by the book.
<SYNC Start=1857953><P Class=ENCC>
We have to wait till<br>
they all step forward.
<SYNC Start=1860285><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1864032><P Class=ENCC>
You know where Ryan Sharkey's at?
<SYNC Start=1866051><P Class=ENCC>
He's downstairs in the lineup.
<SYNC Start=1868591><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1871502><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=BFEFFF>
Number two, step forward.
<SYNC Start=1873936><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1888267><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=BFEFFF>
Turn to your left.
<SYNC Start=1890774><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1893800><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=BFEFFF>
Thank you.
<SYNC Start=1896224><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1899577><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=BFEFFF>
Number three, step forward.
<SYNC Start=1902435><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1910985><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=BFEFFF>
- Is that you?<br>
- You're pathetic. 
<SYNC Start=1913736><P Class=ENCC>
Thank you.<br>
<font color=BFEFFF>
Number four, step forward.
<SYNC Start=1918162><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1926899><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=BFEFFF>
Number three, please put the yo-yo away.
<SYNC Start=1931049><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1933403><P Class=ENCC>
Number four, turn to your right.
<SYNC Start=1936367><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1937765><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=BFEFFF>
Thank you.
<SYNC Start=1939824><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1940891><P Class=ENCC>
- What's your problem?<br>
<font color=BFEFFF>
- You're my problem.
<SYNC Start=1944184><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1944896><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=BFEFFF>
Number four, please let go<br>
of number three.
<SYNC Start=1947369><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=BFEFFF>
Number five, stop kicking.
<SYNC Start=1950110><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=BFEFFF>
Number two, step forward.
<SYNC Start=1952657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1953446><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=BFEFFF>
Number three, please let go<br>
of number four. Step forward.
<SYNC Start=1957118><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1960083><P Class=ENCC>
How's it going?
<SYNC Start=1961120><P Class=ENCC>
Please stop.<br>
Stop. Stop please.
<SYNC Start=1964642><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1966114><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=BFEFFF>
Please let go of number three.
<SYNC Start=1968675><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1973610><P Class=ENCC>
Wait, he's in there.<br>
The killer in there.
<SYNC Start=1975692><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sure he is, Mr. Vingold.<br>
But it doesn't matter.
<SYNC Start=1977781><P Class=ENCC>
The lineup is busted.
<SYNC Start=1980495><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1986491><P Class=ENCC>
That might have been the worst lineup<br>
in the history of law enforcement.
<SYNC Start=1990415><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, it wasn't exactly textbook,<br>
was it.
<SYNC Start=1992657><P Class=ENCC>
Captain, what should I do?
<SYNC Start=1995850><P Class=ENCC>
You do your job, Randy. 
<SYNC Start=1997240><P Class=ENCC>
You write it up exactly as it happened.<br>
Don't worry about me.
<SYNC Start=2001761><P Class=ENCC>
Where's Karpov?
<SYNC Start=2003112><P Class=ENCC>
We had to let him go.
<SYNC Start=2005393><P Class=ENCC>
Sergeant, sit down.
<SYNC Start=2007418><P Class=ENCC>
We're gonna need a statement<br>
from you too.
<SYNC Start=2009747><P Class=ENCC>
Leland, Natalie called to tell me<br>
that you've been fighting again. 
<SYNC Start=2012936><P Class=ENCC>
Are you okay?
<SYNC Start=2015103><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, I'm okay.
<SYNC Start=2017230><P Class=ENCC>
Why don't you ask about<br>
your boyfriend?
<SYNC Start=2020927><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, Karen.
<SYNC Start=2022386><P Class=ENCC>
Leland, I've never seen that<br>
man before in my life.
<SYNC Start=2025349><P Class=ENCC>
Karen, you can just stop pretending.
<SYNC Start=2028242><P Class=ENCC>
Now you're just insulting me.
<SYNC Start=2031123><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2031636><P Class=ENCC>
Karen, would you just tell him?
<SYNC Start=2033650><P Class=ENCC>
Leland, I know you want to kill me.
<SYNC Start=2036343><P Class=ENCC>
I'd probably feel the same way,<br>
all right?
<SYNC Start=2038008><P Class=ENCC>
But you gotta understand.
<SYNC Start=2039889><P Class=ENCC>
Whatever happened between Karen<br>
and I didn't mean anything.
<SYNC Start=2043320><P Class=ENCC>
All right?<br>
It was a mistake.
<SYNC Start=2045552><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sorry.<br>
I'm apologizing to you.
<SYNC Start=2048529><P Class=ENCC>
Who are you?
<SYNC Start=2050399><P Class=ENCC>
Leland, he must be crazy.
<SYNC Start=2052783><P Class=ENCC>
Karen, it was fun.<br>
You gotta face the music.
<SYNC Start=2055736><P Class=ENCC>
It's over between us.<br>
Okay?
<SYNC Start=2057539><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, I don't know him.<br>
You've got to believe me.
<SYNC Start=2060637><P Class=ENCC>
- Do I?<br>
- Yes, you do.
<SYNC Start=2062133><P Class=ENCC>
- You have to believe me.<br>
- Why would he..
<SYNC Start=2064369><P Class=ENCC>
Why would he lie, Karen?<br>
Why would he say these things?
<SYNC Start=2066530><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me.<br>
Excuse me, sergeant.
<SYNC Start=2069639><P Class=ENCC>
You're chewing that apple<br>
on your left side.
<SYNC Start=2072956><P Class=ENCC>
- Yeah, so?<br>
- Why?
<SYNC Start=2075110><P Class=ENCC>
Why, because your friend knocked<br>
my tooth out two day ago, remember?
<SYNC Start=2077934><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, I remember.
<SYNC Start=2079823><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2080213><P Class=ENCC>
But he didn't hit you<br>
on this side.
<SYNC Start=2082893><P Class=ENCC>
The captain is right-handed.
<SYNC Start=2085321><P Class=ENCC>
He hit you on the other side.<br>
Your left side.
<SYNC Start=2087063><P Class=ENCC>
The side..the side you're<br>
chewing on. / Okay.
<SYNC Start=2091619><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2092909><P Class=ENCC>
The captain didn't knock<br>
your tooth out, did he?
<SYNC Start=2096835><P Class=ENCC>
What are you, crazy?
<SYNC Start=2098259><P Class=ENCC>
I'm remembering a few other things.
<SYNC Start=2099997><P Class=ENCC>
You..you used to work<br>
at Mendocino, right?
<SYNC Start=2103613><P Class=ENCC>
When we saw Michael Karpov<br>
in the park, 
<SYNC Start=2106346><P Class=ENCC>
his son was wearing a shirt.<br>
It said Mendocino Day School.
<SYNC Start=2110895><P Class=ENCC>
Michael Karpov lives in Mendocino.
<SYNC Start=2113082><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, a lot of people live in Mendocino.
<SYNC Start=2114941><P Class=ENCC>
I don't know Michael Karpov.
<SYNC Start=2116583><P Class=ENCC>
I think you do.<br>
Ten minutes ago, downstairs,
<SYNC Start=2119013><P Class=ENCC>
you were wearing those clothes<br>
and Karpov called you sergeant.
<SYNC Start=2124094><P Class=ENCC>
That's right.<br>
I heard that too.
<SYNC Start=2125404><P Class=ENCC>
How did he know<br>
you were sergeant, Sergeant?
<SYNC Start=2128674><P Class=ENCC>
This is Disher. Is Gerald Vingold<br>
still in the building?
<SYNC Start=2131522><P Class=ENCC>
You work for Michael Karpov.
<SYNC Start=2134150><P Class=ENCC>
We always suspected<br>
there was a cop on his payroll.
<SYNC Start=2137982><P Class=ENCC>
You killed Chicklet, didn't you?
<SYNC Start=2140480><P Class=ENCC>
That's why you didn't shoot him.
<SYNC Start=2142481><P Class=ENCC>
Cuz you knew the bullet could be<br>
traced back to your weapon.
<SYNC Start=2145160><P Class=ENCC>
Here's what happened.
<SYNC Start=2146661><P Class=ENCC>
You lured Chicklet<br>
to the junk yard.
<SYNC Start=2148909><P Class=ENCC>
But he fought back.
<SYNC Start=2150599><P Class=ENCC>
He must've hit you.<br>
You were bleeding.
<SYNC Start=2152476><P Class=ENCC>
You lost a tooth.<br>
And you had a big problem.
<SYNC Start=2155804><P Class=ENCC>
Your DNA was all over<br>
that crime scene.
<SYNC Start=2158581><P Class=ENCC>
And the cops were on the way.
<SYNC Start=2159950><P Class=ENCC>
You didn't have time<br>
to clean it up.
<SYNC Start=2163310><P Class=ENCC>
You put your uniform on.<br>
You returned to the scene.
<SYNC Start=2165589><P Class=ENCC>
But you knew forensics would<br>
be there any minute.
<SYNC Start=2168055><P Class=ENCC>
What to do?
<SYNC Start=2169986><P Class=ENCC>
What to do?<br>
Then you had an idea.
<SYNC Start=2173809><P Class=ENCC>
I'm your husband.<br>
That makes it my business, okay?
<SYNC Start=2177473><P Class=ENCC>
If you picked a fight with someone,
<SYNC Start=2180502><P Class=ENCC>
if you could provoke them<br>
and get them to hit you,
<SYNC Start=2183367><P Class=ENCC>
you'd be home free.
<SYNC Start=2185611><P Class=ENCC>
They could find your tooth,<br>
your DNA, your blood.
<SYNC Start=2189848><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2191212><P Class=ENCC>
And nobody would ever question it.
<SYNC Start=2192867><P Class=ENCC>
You told my husband we were<br>
sleeping together so that he would hit you?
<SYNC Start=2196227><P Class=ENCC>
???<br>
You can't prove any of this.
<SYNC Start=2199014><P Class=ENCC>
I think we can.<br>
We can connect you to Karpov.
<SYNC Start=2201501><P Class=ENCC>
We'll pull your phone bills,<br>
your e-mails, your bank accounts.
<SYNC Start=2205280><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, I think you might need<br>
a little more than that.
<SYNC Start=2207324><P Class=ENCC>
That's the guy.
<SYNC Start=2208658><P Class=ENCC>
I've been telling you guys all day.
<SYNC Start=2209923><P Class=ENCC>
I saw him at the junk yard.<br>
That's the guy.
<SYNC Start=2212930><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2213697><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, hey, are you done with that?
<SYNC Start=2218101><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2219166><P Class=ENCC>
It's not for me.
<SYNC Start=2221177><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2221583><P Class=ENCC>
It's for Devo.
<SYNC Start=2224243><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2225208><P Class=ENCC>
He's had a pretty rough day.
<SYNC Start=2228624><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2229037><P Class=ENCC>
That mouse was in my pocket.<br>
It was in my pocket.
<SYNC Start=2234780><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2237382><P Class=ENCC>
Let's go, Sharkey.
<SYNC Start=2239874><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2252639><P Class=ENCC>
Are you okay?
<SYNC Start=2254412><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2263405><P Class=ENCC>
Heck of a thing, huh?
<SYNC Start=2265625><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2269696><P Class=ENCC>
Actually, it's kind of flattering<br>
if you think about it.
<SYNC Start=2272637><P Class=ENCC>
He picked me because<br>
he knew that I would react.
<SYNC Start=2275946><P Class=ENCC>
Cuz he could tell how much<br>
I love you.
<SYNC Start=2278366><P Class=ENCC>
It's not flattering, Leland.
<SYNC Start=2281161><P Class=ENCC>
Look, Karen.<br>
I know that I've got a temper,
<SYNC Start=2283941><P Class=ENCC>
but I've been working on it.
<SYNC Start=2286426><P Class=ENCC>
I've got a yo-yo.
<SYNC Start=2289131><P Class=ENCC>
Actually, I, uh, the yo-yo broke<br>
when I threw it at the guy. 
<SYNC Start=2292509><P Class=ENCC>
Why didn't you believe me?
<SYNC Start=2295217><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2296878><P Class=ENCC>
I had Monk follow you<br>
yesterday afternoon.
<SYNC Start=2300921><P Class=ENCC>
He saw you meeting a man.
<SYNC Start=2302246><P Class=ENCC>
You had me followed?
<SYNC Start=2305201><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2309419><P Class=ENCC>
You wanna tell me about it?
<SYNC Start=2312010><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2314830><P Class=ENCC>
His name is Max Tepperton.
<SYNC Start=2317421><P Class=ENCC>
He's a divorce lawyer.
<SYNC Start=2320096><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2320560><P Class=ENCC>
You've been sleeping<br>
with a divorce lawyer?
<SYNC Start=2324964><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2327023><P Class=ENCC>
You know what?<br>
It doesn't matter.
<SYNC Start=2329255><P Class=ENCC>
Because I forgive you, Karen.
<SYNC Start=2331809><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2332309><P Class=ENCC>
Hell, I'm no saint.
<SYNC Start=2334450><P Class=ENCC>
- We'll get past this.<br>
- No, Leland.
<SYNC Start=2337781><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2346129><P Class=ENCC>
He's representing me.
<SYNC Start=2349063><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2356806><P Class=ENCC>
Stottlemeyer vs. Stottlemeyer.
<SYNC Start=2360954><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2364048><P Class=ENCC>
Why? / Because you have<br>
to ask why, Leland.
<SYNC Start=2369434><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2371841><P Class=ENCC>
That's why.
<SYNC Start=2374258><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2400494><P Class=ENCC>
So is that it?
<SYNC Start=2402165><P Class=ENCC>
Yep.
<SYNC Start=2403461><P Class=ENCC>
Twenty years, two suitcases.
<SYNC Start=2406343><P Class=ENCC>
Where are the boys?
<SYNC Start=2408365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2409380><P Class=ENCC>
They're with Karen.
<SYNC Start=2411427><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2411827><P Class=ENCC>
At her sister's.
<SYNC Start=2413787><P Class=ENCC>
How are they doing?
<SYNC Start=2416040><P Class=ENCC>
Not good.
<SYNC Start=2418130><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2419128><P Class=ENCC>
Listen, captain, if you need<br>
somebody to talk to,
<SYNC Start=2424128><P Class=ENCC>
just call, anytime about anything<br>
even in the middle of the night.
<SYNC Start=2426767><P Class=ENCC>
Monk, I know your number.
<SYNC Start=2428288><P Class=ENCC>
No, no, it's not me.<br>
It's Natalie's home phone.
<SYNC Start=2431718><P Class=ENCC>
She's really good.
<SYNC Start=2433970><P Class=ENCC>
He's right.<br>
Anytime.
<SYNC Start=2436522><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2436997><P Class=ENCC>
Thank you.
<SYNC Start=2439375><P Class=ENCC>
Well, you know the old saying,<br>
"When God closes a door..."
<SYNC Start=2442569><P Class=ENCC>
When God closes a door,
<SYNC Start=2445992><P Class=ENCC>
sometimes He breaks your heart.
<SYNC Start=2449889><P Class=ENCC>
That's not the old saying.
<SYNC Start=2452138><P Class=ENCC>
It is today.
