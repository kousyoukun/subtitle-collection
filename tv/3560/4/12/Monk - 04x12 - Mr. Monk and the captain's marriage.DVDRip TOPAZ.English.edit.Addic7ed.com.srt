00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,022
Ha, ha, ha."

150
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,557
- So you're denying it?
- No, I'm not denying it.

151
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,295
<i>It's so crazy I won't</i>
<i>even respond to it.</i>

152
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,735
I can't believe we're even
talking about this.

153
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,637
Well, it sure would explain a lot.

154
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,641
Like what?
You know.

155
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,476
Like you sleeping in the guest room.

156
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,038
Because you've been snoring.

157
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,108
I didn't just start snoring, Karen.

158
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,785
And you forgetting our anniversary.

159
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:22,924
And you not wanting
to touch me anymore.

160
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,225
Leland, we have problems.

161
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,734
I'm not saying we don't,
but that isn't one of them...

162
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,270
Or at least, it wasn't.

163
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,603
You used to tie my neckties.

164
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,915
If he's convicted, Michael Karpov
is looking at 25 years to life,

165
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,855
which gives us motive
with a capital "M."

166
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,451
- That makes him suspect number one.
- What about physical evidence?

167
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,462
Unfortunately, there's not much.

168
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,363
Crime scene was contaminated
by two of our own.

169
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,596
<i>But that's the bad news.</i>
<i>The good news is,</i>
<i>there's a witness</i>...

170
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,603
A homeless man, a transient.

171
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,764
A homeless transient.

172
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,936
He's known as, uh, Jerry or Gerald,
35, maybe 40 years old.

173
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:15,606
If we can find him,
we can bring Karpov in
for a lineup.

174
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,149
Thank you, Lieutenant.
I'll take it from here.

175
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,777
Actually, sir, I'm in charge.

176
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,844
Says who?

177
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,823
Deputy chief.

178
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,325
[Murmuring]

179
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,555
I'm really sorry, sir.

180
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,667
Oh. Uh...

181
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:39,171
Carry on. I'll be in my office.

182
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,468
Wait a minute.
Why don't you keep the pointer?

183
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,569
I don't want the pointer, Randy.

184
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,579
You're doing a great job.

185
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,638
Carry on.
Oh, no. It's okay.

186
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,378
I can use my finger.
See? Look. Works just as well.

187
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,683
Even better. It bends.

188
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,690
Take the pointer, Randy.

189
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,028
<i>[Door Closes]</i>
All right. Let's get to work.

Careful. Both hands.
That's too high.

192
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:52,933
Oh, those things are death traps.
That's not just my opinion.
It's a fact.

193
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,038
Belgium, 1952, a kid almost
died on one of those.

194
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,640
There he is.
Where?

195
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,117
Where? That guy?

196
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,154
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Doesn't look like a drug dealer.</i>

197
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,622
<i>He's indicted for dealing.</i>
<i>He's guilty of a whole lot worse.</i>

198
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,754
Mr. Karpov, good morning.
Ah.

199
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,526
Got a minute?
Captain Stottlemeyer,
for you, any time.

200
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:17,228
Teddy, these men are policemen.

201
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,430
What do we do
when we see a policeman?

202
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,496
Aha. Very good. See?

203
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,769
I'm teaching him respect
for the law.

204
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:28,177
Chicklet has passed on.
Yes, I heard. Heartbreaking.

205
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,273
Hello. You have a little...
You have a smudge there.

206
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,285
I bet I can read your mind, Captain.
I'll get it.

207
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,617
<i>You want to know where I was</i>
<i>yesterday morning?</i>

208
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,782
That's right, about 6:00 a.m.

209
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,792
6:00 a.m. I was...

210
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,351
in bed with my beautiful wife,
where I belong.

211
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,132
Can you prove that?
That's not the question.

212
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,293
The question is,
can you prove I wasn't?

213
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,167
Do you own a stun gun,
Mr. Karpov?

214
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,834
What would I do with a gun?
I'm a businessman.
I import furniture.

215
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,434
Sure you do.
<i>And you are a very pretty lady.</i>

216
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:03,243
Perhaps I could sell you an end table,
hand-carved, from Estonia?

217
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,249
Then you would believe me.

218
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,547
Look.

219
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,986
<i>You're watching me.</i>
<i>The press is watching me.</i>

220
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:13,889
I would be a fool to sneak away
and do this thing.
And I am not a fool.

221
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,292
Either you did it,
or you hired somebody to do it.

222
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,730
You see that, Teddy?
That is what they call "speculation."

223
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,634
Something that the policemen do
when they're trying to scare you.

224
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,695
<i>Why don't you go play</i>
<i>with your friends?</i>

225
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,833
There was a witness, Michael...
a witness at the junkyard...

226
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,208
who saw everything.
Oh. What did he say?

227
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,043
"He"? How did you know
it was a man?

228
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:39,243
He just said it was a witness.

229
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:43,084
He, she... Doesn't hardly matter
because you are bluffing.

230
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,680
<i>If you had any witnesses,</i>
<i>then I would be down</i>
<i>at your station house...</i>

231
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:50,593
in one of your ridiculous lineups.
There's gonna be a lineup. Very soon.

232
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,491
Enjoy these moments
with your son, Michael.

233
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,503
Take lots of pictures.

234
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:02,735
Because you're not gonna
be seeing him for a very long time.

235
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,011
Oh, finally. I got it.

236
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,274
I think I'm sick.

237
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,249
Save yourselves. She's gonna blow!

238
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,786
It's gonna get ugly.

239
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,421
Listen, uh, I need a favor.

240
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,586
Karen's going out this afternoon.
She says she's going
to the movies.

241
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:27,428
I want you to follow her.
Oh, Captain, no.

242
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,729
You said
she denied everything.
She did.

243
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:33,363
That sergeant was just joking around.
He was just trying to impress
his idiot friends.

244
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,373
I don't think so.

245
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:39,036
Karen and me...
We don't even fight anymore.

246
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,102
Last week she said she was
at her friend's house.

247
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,114
I called there.
She wasn't there.

248
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,116
Week before that
it was the same thing.

249
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,209
Leland, don't ask me
to do this.

250
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,083
Monk, I really need to know.

251
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,145
I'd do it myself,

252
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:55,319
but the chief says I need to go
to this anger management class,
which really pisses me off.

253
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,794
I knocked out a tooth.
One tooth.

254
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,889
It's not like I killed the guy.
Who was that clown?
I've never seen him before.

255
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,298
Ryan Sharkey, Jr.
He was a motorcycle cop.

256
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,633
He just transferred in
from Mendocino.

257
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,264
- Wait. You pulled his file?
- You bet I did.

258
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,331
He's a real hotshot.

259
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,845
Has a couple of big arrests.
He's been cited for bravery twice.

260
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,405
And I hear he's
a real ladies' man.
You want some advice?

261
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,474
Forget what he said.
Just forget it.

262
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,078
Go home and hug your wife.
I don't want any more advice.

263
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:26,352
I wanna know where
Karen is going this afternoon.

264
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,258
What if she sees us?
She's gonna know that you
asked us to follow her.

265
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,024
- Wouldn't that be worse?
- Worse than not knowing?

266
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,692
Isn't it killing you, not knowing
what happened to Trudy?

267
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,863
How many times
have I asked you for a favor?

268
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,170
103.
Counting this, 104.

269
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,844
How many times
have I said "please"?

270
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,809
[Sighs]
Okay.

271
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,897
[Monk]
Okay, here's how
you follow someone.

272
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,235
Stay at least 40 feet back.

273
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,002
Not more than 60.

274
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,241
And, whenever possible,

275
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,912
try to use reflective surfaces.

276
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,582
"Reflective surfaces"?

277
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,032
Yeah. See? Very discreet.

278
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,695
Reflective surfaces. What...

279
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,761
Wait a minute. I lost her.
Where'd she go?

280
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,706
Okay, would this be considered
a reflective surface?

281
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:53,336
Yeah. Mirrors...
Mirrors are good too.

I remember,

292
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,739
this one weekend he went hunting...

293
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,078
and she stayed home...

00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:23,003
<i>if you could provoke them</i>
<i>and get them to hit you,</i>

600
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,275
<i>you'd be home free.</i>

601
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,546
<i>They could f</i>i<i>nd your tooth,</i>

602
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:33,022
- You knocked my tooth out. God.
- And nobody would ever question it.

603
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,718
You told my husband
we were sleeping together
so that he would hit you?

604
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,727
Oh, come... Would you...

605
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,025
You can't prove any of this.
I think we can.

606
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:42,031
We can connect you to Karpov.

607
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,693
We'll pull your phone bills,
your e-mails, your bank accounts...

608
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,135
Yeah, I think you might need
a little more than that.

609
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,571
That's the guy.
I've been telling you guys all day.

610
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,905
I saw him at the junkyard.
That's the guy.

611
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:56,276
Oh. Uh, hey, are you done with that?

612
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,084
It's not for me.

613
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,552
- It's for Devo.
- Mm-hmm.

614
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,986
Mm-hmm.
He's had a pretty rough day.

615
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,491
That mouse was in my pocket.

616
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:13,486
He was in my pocket.

617
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,269
<i>Let's go, Sharkey.</i>

618
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,449
Are you okay?

619
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,786
[Laughing]

620
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,422
Heck of a thing, huh?

621
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:52,161
Actually, it's kind of flattering,
if you think about it.

622
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,797
He picked me because he knew
that I would react...

623
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:58,307
'cause he could tell
how much I love you.

624
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,970
It's not flattering, Leland.

625
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,479
Look, Karen, I know
that I've got a temper,

626
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:06,277
but I've been working on it.

627
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,046
I've got a yo-yo.

628
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,680
Actually, the yo-yo broke
when I threw it at the guy.

629
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:13,656
Why didn't you believe me?

630
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,388
I had Monk follow you
yesterday afternoon.

631
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,557
He saw you meeting a man.
You had me followed?

632
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,468
You wanna tell me about him?

633
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,875
His name is Max Tepperton.

634
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,881
He's a divorce lawyer.

635
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,714
You've been sleeping
with a divorce lawyer?

636
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:49,051
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

637
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:51,686
Because I forgive you, Karen.

638
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:55,323
Hell, I'm no saint.
We'll get past this.

639
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,333
No, Leland.

640
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:07,676
He's representing me.

641
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:20,086
<i>"Stottlemeyer versus Stottlemeyer. '"</i>

642
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,128
Why?

643
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,255
Because you have to ask why, Leland.

644
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,568
That's why.

645
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,092
So is that it?
Yeah.

646
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,227
Twenty years, two suitcases.

647
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,237
Where are the boys?

648
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:12,908
They're with Karen...
at her sister's.

649
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,969
How they doing?

650
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,071
Not good.

651
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:22,449
Listen, Captain,
if you need somebody
to talk to...

652
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,683
Here. Just call any time,
about anything,

653
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,350
even in the middle
of the night.
Monk, I know your number.

654
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,486
No, it's not me.
This is Natalie's home phone.

655
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,860
She's really good.

656
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,865
He's right. Any time.

657
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:39,362
Thanks.

658
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,031
Well, you know the old saying.
"When God closes a door"...

659
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,405
Yeah, "When God closes a door,

660
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:48,775
sometimes he breaks your heart."

661
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:51,610
That's not the old saying.

662
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:53,877
It is today.
