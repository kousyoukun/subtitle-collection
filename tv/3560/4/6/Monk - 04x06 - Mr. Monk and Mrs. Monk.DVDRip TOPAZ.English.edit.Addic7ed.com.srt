00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,955
Yeah, but she took the film.

300
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,957
<i>[Disher]</i>
<i>Captain!</i>

301
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,619
Yeah, okay.
We just caught one
in Mission Hill.

302
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,754
- Now?
- Neighbor heard a fight.
Door was open.

303
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,856
She went in, found a body.

304
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,425
Karen's gonna kill me.
But, all right, uh,
grab Philby and Dietrich.

305
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:29,299
All right, uh, 418 Vinton,
Apartment 3-D.

306
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:32,275
- Victim's name was Ellinghouse.
- Ellinghouse?

307
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:35,177
Yeah, Zachary Ellinghouse.
Why? You know him?

308
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,643
Hey, what's going on?
Nothing.

309
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,517
We're rolling. There's a fresh
one in Mission Hill.

310
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,523
All right, let's go. I'm in.
No. Hey, hey, hey, Monk.

311
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,525
Look, we don't need you
on this one.

312
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,027
I want you to stay here.
Look, uh, clean the grill.

313
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,859
The grill is
really greasy.
Yeah.

314
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,865
What?
Yeah, yeah, come on.
It'll be fun.

315
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,493
What are you talking about?
I'm getting my badge back.

316
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,503
I'm back on
the team, right?

317
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,301
Come on, uh, let's go.
I'm in. Let's lock and load.

318
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,803
[Coughing]
Oh, it's really dusty in here.

319
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,974
Mr. -Mr. Monk, maybe
you should wait in the car.

320
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,450
No, no, no. I'm fine.
You know, Monk,
we can't pay you for this.

321
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,115
Oh, it's on the house.
Least I could do.

322
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,216
Yeah, here we go.
Body was here?

323
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,319
Yeah. Looks like he was
on the desk, face down.

324
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,627
<i>Uh, he fell onto this thing,</i>
<i>rolled over onto the floor.</i>
<i>What do you call that thing?</i>

325
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:31,100
Spindle.
Spindle. God, that's it.
Finish my report.

326
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,104
The rug was like this.
Yeah.

327
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,541
Looks like he tripped.
Wasn't premeditated.

328
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,874
Oh, there was a struggle...
with a woman.

329
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,880
A woman?
How do you know that?

330
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,815
Heel marks in the carpet.
Oh, she had very small feet.

331
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,818
A lot of women
have small feet.

332
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,902
She wore perfume.

333
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,531
Shalimar.
Trudy wore Shalimar.

334
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,541
Wait.

335
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,869
No reading glasses.

336
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,649
I think he kept something
stashed in this book.

337
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:31,087
- A key. Did they find a key?
- No. No, nothing.

338
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,722
Maybe they were fighting
over that.

339
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,734
<i>[Disher]</i>
<i>Look at this.</i>

340
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,770
It's her mug... lipstick.

341
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,771
Oh, yes.

Cinnamon...
to sweeten the coffee.

344
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,980
Trudy used to do that.

345
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,848
Is this the victim?
Yeah. His name's Zach...
Zach Ellinghouse.

346
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,184
Oh, no!
I knew him.

347
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,451
Ellinghouse, Natalie.

348
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,788
You were just
asking me about him.

349
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,522
Captain,
his daughter, Janice,

350
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,724
used to work with my...

351
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,323
Trudy.

352
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,961
It's weird you keep
mentioning Trudy.

353
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,130
There was a witness
who heard a struggle.

354
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,140
L-Lieutenant, let me... let me...
What's this?

"Witness distinctly

Trudy.

358
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,688
That was Trudy's name.

00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,330
Mr. Monk, there's something
I need to tell you.

360
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,629
Yeah.

361

Lf... Mitch were...

362
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,406
somehow still alive,
I'd want somebody to tell me.

363
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:55,743
Tell you what? What?
What are you talking about?

364
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,383
It's Trudy.

365
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,820
She's not...

366
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,248
She's not dead, Mr. Monk.

Trudy?

368
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,394
I've been following her.

369
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,164
I talked to her.
[Scoffs]

370

Well, this is...
I mean, that... This is just...
Monk. Hey, Monk.

371
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:26,309
Monk, I don't believe it either, okay?
But we don't know what's going on.

372
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,745
Captain...
Look, M-Maybe if we just got...
if we got a sample of her D.N.A.

373
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,113
No. No!
No, that way we'd know
where we stand.

374
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,118
Trudy's D.N.A.?
What are you saying?

375
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:38,020
Maybe we could just exhume the body.
Look, we're miles away
from exhuming anything.

376
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,287
She said she faked her
own death to protect you.

377
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,726
She's alive, Mr. Monk.

was it her?

385
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:59,970
He's not sure.
She was too far away.

386
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,941
Did you make the car?

387
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,101
S-Sedan.

<i>Gray sedan.</i>

00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,774
What kind of sedan?

390
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:21,458
Did you see the driver?

391
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,957
The license number?
He doesn't remember.

How do you think
he's doing?

I have never felt more
helpless in my life.

399
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,394
Well, I just spoke
to Hank Merchant
at the D.A.'s office.

400
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,553
Wait. Did I authorize that?
No, sir.

401

I figured
you wouldn't mind.

I'm the man,
remember?
[Sighs]

403
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,569
I laid everything
out for him,

and he thinks
we have enough
to exhume the body.

You just have to
say the word.
Look, hey, no, no.

<i>There is some evidence to suggest...</i>

Excuse me?

414

We think she faked her
own death and has been
hiding out ever since.

415

And we're pretty sure
she killed a guy earlier today.
Trudy's our primary suspect.

416
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:41,161
All right. All right.
So he's having a psychotic break.
He's delusional.

00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,684
[Sighs]
She's still dead.

454
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,949
[Exhales]

455
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:47,457
She's right where I left her.

456
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,686
Okay.
And I am so...

457
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,697
relieved.

458
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,199
I mean, I love her
with all my heart,

459
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,201

<i>This is my husband.</i>
<i>Ah.</i>

463
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,703
I'm sure he's dead too.

464
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,941
And he'll stay dead.
Don't worry about that.

465
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:14,416
This is an excellent cemetery.
They know what they're doing.

466
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,921
Everybody here...
probably dead.

<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

469

That's it, there.
Trudy's desk?

470
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,604
For five years.

471
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,799
She loved this job.

472
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,944
I did that.

00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:43,207
<i>I was leaning in to kiss her,</i>

474
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,215
spilled some coffee.
[Chuckles]

475
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,751
I bet it was the last
time you spilled anything
in your life.

476
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:51,778
Oh, I spilled something
seven years later...
January 12, 1999.

477
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,188
January 12? You mean
during the earthquake?

478
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:58,161
Earthquakes count.
I don't make the rules.

479
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,496
Mr. Monk, could I ask
you something?

480

<i>What happened yesterday</i>
<i>in the cemetery?</i>

481

How do you know the woman
we've been seeing isn't Trudy?

482
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,007
We still have one or two
copies in the archives.
You can keep that one.

483
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,670
I don't understand.
Why would anybody
want to impersonate Trudy?

484
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:18,682
I don't know.
I wish some of these kids
would impersonate her a little bit.

485
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,150
She was the best
reporter I ever knew.

486
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:25,417
Here it is..."Peer Pressure"
byJanice Ellinghouse
and Trudy Monk.

487
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,687
It was the only article
they ever wrote together.
It's a hell of a piece.

488
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,284
<i>It should have won</i>
<i>a Pulitzer.</i>
Yeah.

489
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:34,161
- It was on the dockworkers' union?
- Ed Lindley, the union president,
was indicted because of that.

490
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,757
He's still in jail.
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>The guy was untouchable.</i>

491
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,703
But Trudy and Janice
never stopped digging.
That article made history.

492
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:43,263
<i>Lindley's second-in-command,</i>
<i>Jack Bollinger,</i>

493
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,275
became the union president
because of this.

494
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,743
He's still there. Seems to be
running a pretty clean shop.

495
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,746
Whoa, they are really
naming names here.

496
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,509
Look at all these payoffs.

497
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:56,543
How did they get all this?
Hard work and a secret informant.
Deep background.

498
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,612
Trudy never told <i>me</i>
who it was.

499
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,090
Well, they never told me either.

500
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,218
Where was
Janice's desk?

501
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:06,388
Over there. Still haven't
cleaned it out yet.

502
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,830
It's, uh, hard to
say good-bye.

503
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,834
Yes, it is.

504
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,145
- "Pay rent."
- <i>Yeah, so?</i>

505
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,446
She was already
paying a mortgage.

506
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:31,955
What could she be renting?
What... What... What can you
rent for a hundred and five dollars?

507
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:35,982
I rent a storage locker.
It costs about that much
per month.

508
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:42,963
The missing key...
the one from the book.
It could have opened a locker.

509
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:48,370
Mr. Monk, there are hundreds
of storage lockers in San Francisco.
Where would we even start?

510
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,464
Well, Natalie,

511
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:54,102
how about
Trans-Cal Moving and Storage,
13025 Third Street?

512
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:56,112
What?

513
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,819
Th-This storage place...
what time does it open?

514
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,720
<i>[Trudy] 8:00.</i>
I'm gonna need you
to come along with me.

515
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,453
Why? You said
once I got you the key,
I could leave.

516
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:12,655
Change of plans.
I don't know what kind
of security they're gonna have.

517
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,995
If we're stopped,
I'm gonna need you
to pretend to beJanice.

518
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,001
Oh, and bring that along.
She was a blonde too.

519
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,594
I hate this thing.
Why? It looks
pretty good on you.

520
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,106
Then, you looked pretty good
as the redhead in that show.

<i>called again?</i>

Yeah, I know that.

523
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:34,348
And I am sorry.
It was a terrible accident.
And that other guy... Trudy's husband.

524
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:38,185
I will never forget his face.
I mean, he was really hurting.

525
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,190
Look, things happen.

526
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,192
We're moving on.

527
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,956
This is all about
self-preservation now.
Do you understand?

528
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:49,329
If whatever is in
that storage locker ever gets out,
I am a dead man.

529
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,334
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.

530
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:54,963
Look-Look.
You're an actress, aren't you?

531
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,371

Good morning.

00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,558
What's going on?
Organizing a task force.

535
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,757
Out of my office?
Yes, sir.

536
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:25,599
Well, I figured
you wouldn't mind.
I'm the man, right?

537
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,729
Yeah, that's right.
You're the man.

538
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,739
Don't worry, sir.
I am all over this one.

539
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:32,833
I've reassigned Rudner
and Sergeant Hyden.
They're already on their way in.

540
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:36,539
The report from the lab.
There were no identifiable prints
in the apartment.

541
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,344
Trudy must have wiped
everything down before she left.

542
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,612
I'm running off 5,000 of those...
"Wanted for Questioning."

543
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:45,281
I put a photo of her
up on the hot board,
and I've been trying to contact her parents.

544
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:49,221
W-Wait, are you...
Wait. You've been trying
to contact whose parents?

545
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:52,456
Trudy's. In case
she tries to call them.
No, Randy. Wait, wait, wait...

546
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,431
And I'm, uh,
releasing that to the press.
It's a press release.

547
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,266
Oh, uh, I called the deputy
commissioner too. Just want...
Lieutenant!

548
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,271
Excuse me, gentlemen.

Randall,

551
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,885
when I said that about...

552
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:18,217
about you being the man,

553
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,393
I thought I was
talking to Monk.

554
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,868
Oh.

555
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,972
Okay.
Well, that explains it.

556
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,134
Randy, it doesn't mean
that I don't appreciate...
No, l-I understand.

557
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,144
No problem.

558
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,271
Why don't I just get you
a cup of coffee?

559
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,783
Won't be needing that.

560

[Sighs]

561
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,668
It's number 12.
Number 12.
How do you know?

562
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,673
I saw the list.

563
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,675
The security guard just
showed you the list?

564
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:15,576
Not exactly.
I caught a glimpse of it
as he was bending over.

565
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:19,013
Why was he bending over?
To help me look
for my earring.

566
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:23,076
[Gasps]
I lost my earring.
Oh, my God.

567
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:26,419
It's irreplaceable.
It was a gift from my Aunt Lisa
on her deathbed.

568
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,085
I think it might have
fallen over there.

569
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,798
Maybe she's already been here.
No.

570
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:39,235
There's water in the handle
from the rain last night.

571
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,397
It would have spilled out
if she lifted the door.

572
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:46,476
Listen. Listen.

I had her back.

[Sighs]
For an hour and a half,

578
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,536
I thought she might be alive.
Psst.

579
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:23,276
[Exhales]
I had hope.

Isn't hope the worst?

No, Mr. Monk.
Hope is a good thing.

<i>Now that they're both gone,</i>
<i>he must be panicked...</i>

that all of their research material
will be made public.

What about the woman?

Bollinger must have
just found her.

593
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:11,821
It was a con game
to trickJanice's father
into giving up that key.

594
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,797
I don't get it.
How did she know
so much about Trudy?

595
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,799
Bollinger must have
coached her.

596

He spent time with Trudy
when they were writing this,

597
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,532
so he knew a lot about her.

00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:34,879
Monk broke the case.
They're at a storage locker
right up the street.

601
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:36,886
Randy.

602
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:38,979
Randy!
Let's go.

603
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:42,184
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you talking to me?

604
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,194
[Sighs]
It's just hard
to tell sometimes.

605
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,130
Randy,

606
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,189
you know how fragile Monk is.

607
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,498
I have to stroke him all the time.
But you're tougher than that.

608
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,505
Come on.
You're the man. Let's go.
Oh, so everybody's the man.

609
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:59,269
No. Just you and Monk.

610
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:02,608
You're my <i>two</i> men.
Let's go.

611
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,274
If we were both drowning,
who would you save?

612
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:07,283
I don't know...
both of you.

613
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:09,581
No, if you could
only save one of us.

614
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:13,522
I'd probably save Monk
because he can't swim,
and I know you're an excellent swimmer.

615
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,525
Suppose I was
holding an anchor?

616
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:19,291
You're holding an anchor?
Uh-huh.
Who would you save then?

617
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:22,560
Well, why don't you
let go of the anchor?

618
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,624
It's a family heirloom.

619
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,172
I'm leaving.

620
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:49,322
Mr. Bollinger,
can I go now?
Go start the car.

621
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,520
No, no.
Mr. Monk, it's not Trudy.

622
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:53,995
Let's just wait for
the captain. Just...

623
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,093
Stay here.

624
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,103
What the hell
are you doing?

625
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:04,039
I found some notebooks
and some tapes,
but they're not all labeled,

626
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,770
and... I can't afford
to miss anything.

627
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,938
<i>So we...</i>

628
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,608
are going to Plan B.
Oh, Mr...

629
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,517
- Mr. Bollinger, you can't do that!
I don't want anyone else getting hurt.
- Start the damn car!

630
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:18,384
Trudy?

631
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:21,948
- What the hell is he doing here?
- I'm her husband.

632
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:29,360
<i>Son of a bitch, it never ends.</i>
<i>H- How did he f</i>i<i>nd us?</i>

633
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:32,163
<i>Who else knows we're here?</i>

634
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,204
<i>Hey, I'm talking to you.</i>
Your hair...

635
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:37,104
hair was more like... like...

636
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:39,540
[Stammering]
Look, l-I didn't know, okay?

637
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,373
L-I thought this was just a job.

638
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:46,482
First row, number 12!
<i>[Tires Screeching]</i>

639
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,286
You, freak show,
get away from her.

640
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,449
No, Mr. Bollinger, don't.
Trudy, listen.

641
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:57,221
Okay, that is enough!
No, no, no! Don't!

642
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,558
<i>Don't!</i>

643
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,564
<i>They're gonna f</i>i<i>nd</i>
<i>a body in the ashes here!</i>

644
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:04,192
I have no choice!
He knows too much!

645
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:07,460
- Oh, God.
- <i>[Stottlemeyer] Hey!</i>

646
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,103
[Yelps]

647
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:28,091
[Groaning]

648
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,829
[Panting]

649
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,957
Oh, I'm so sorry.

650
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,806
You loved her.

651
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,380
I'll tell her.

652
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,768
<i>[Natalie]</i>
<i>Well, I think it stinks.</i>
<i>What stinks?</i>

653
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,774
The department deciding
not to reinstate you.

654
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,776
They didn't even
give you a chance.

655
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,778
You can't really
blame them.

656
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:24,815
After what happened,
I'm kind of back to...

657
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,816
What? Normal?

658
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:30,217
Well, to... to kind of normal.
Uh...

659
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:33,484
What?
Wait a second.
Uh, I touched that one twice.

660
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,491
I have to...

661
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,256
You know, Mr. Monk,
you never told me.

662
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,264
What happened
in the cemetery?

663
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,062
How did you know
that that woman
wasn't really Trudy?

664
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,069
Well, I went to the grave,

665
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,299
and it still hurt.

666
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,899
So I knew.

667
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,911
Yeah, I know that hurt.

668
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,539
It's never wrong.

669
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:01,415
Nope. It isn't.
Neither are you.

670
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,687
