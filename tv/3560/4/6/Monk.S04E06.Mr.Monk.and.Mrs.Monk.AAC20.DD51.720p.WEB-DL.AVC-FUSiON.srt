It's not even really a street.

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,500
- Now?
- Neighbor heard a fight. Door was open.

303
00:18:20,577 --> 00:18:22,602
She went in, found a body.

304
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,171
Karen's gonna kill me.
But, all right, uh, grab Philby and Dietrich.

305
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:31,045
All right, uh, 418 Vinton,
Apartment 3-D.

306
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,021
- Victim's name was Ellinghouse.
- Ellinghouse?

307
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,923
Yeah, Zachary Ellinghouse.
Why? You know him?

308
00:18:38,862 --> 00:18:42,389
Hey, what's going on?
Nothing.

309
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:45,263
We're rolling. There's a fresh
one in Mission Hill.

310
00:18:45,335 --> 00:18:47,269
All right, let's go. I'm in.
No. Hey, hey, hey, Monk.

311
00:18:47,337 --> 00:18:49,271
Look, we don't need you
on this one.

312
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:51,773
I want you to stay here.
Look, uh, clean the grill.

313
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:54,605
The grill is
really greasy. Yeah.

314
00:18:54,677 --> 00:18:56,611
What?
Yeah, yeah, come on. It'll be fun.

315
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:59,239
What are you talking about?
I'm getting my badge back.

316
00:18:59,315 --> 00:19:01,249
I'm back on
the team, right?

317
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:04,047
Come on, uh, let's go.
I'm in. Let's lock and load.

318
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:10,549
[Coughing]
Oh, it's really dusty in here.

319
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:12,720
Mr. -Mr. Monk, maybe
you should wait in the car.

320
00:19:12,795 --> 00:19:16,196
No, no, no. I'm fine.
You know, Monk, we can't pay you for this.

321
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:19,861
Oh, it's on the house.
Least I could do.

322
00:19:19,936 --> 00:19:22,962
Yeah, here we go.
Body was here?

323
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,065
Yeah. Looks like he was
on the desk, face down.

324
00:19:26,142 --> 00:19:29,373
<i>Uh, he fell onto this thing,</i>
<i>rolled over onto the floor.</i> <i>What do you call that thing?</i>

325
00:19:29,445 --> 00:19:32,846
Spindle.
Spindle. God, that's it. Finish my report.

326
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,850
The rug was like this.
Yeah.

327
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:39,287
Looks like he tripped.
Wasn't premeditated.

328
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:42,620
Oh, there was a struggle...
with a woman.

329
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:44,626
A woman?
How do you know that?

330
00:19:44,694 --> 00:19:47,561
Heel marks in the carpet.
Oh, she had very small feet.

331
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,564
A lot of women
have small feet.

332
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,648
She wore perfume.

333
00:20:06,716 --> 00:20:10,277
Shalimar.
Trudy wore Shalimar.

334
00:20:10,353 --> 00:20:12,287
Wait.

335
00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:15,615
No reading glasses.

336
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:26,395
I think he kept something
stashed in this book.

337
00:20:29,272 --> 00:20:32,833
- A key. Did they find a key?
- No. No, nothing.

338
00:20:33,977 --> 00:20:36,468
Maybe they were fighting
over that.

339
00:20:36,546 --> 00:20:38,480
<i>[Disher]</i>
<i>Look at this.</i>

340
00:20:38,548 --> 00:20:40,516
It's her mug- lipstick.

341
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,517
Oh, yes.

342
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,454
[Sniffing]

343
00:20:46,522 --> 00:20:49,719
Cinnamon-
to sweeten the coffee.

344
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:51,726
Trudy used to do that.

345
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:56,594
Is this the victim?
Yeah. His name's Zach- Zach Ellinghouse.

346
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,930
Oh, no!
I knew him.

347
00:20:59,002 --> 00:21:01,197
Ellinghouse, Natalie.

348
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,534
You were just
asking me about him.

349
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:06,268
Captain,
his daughter, Janice,

350
00:21:06,342 --> 00:21:09,470
used to work with my-

351
00:21:09,545 --> 00:21:11,069
Trudy.

352
00:21:11,147 --> 00:21:13,707
It's weird you keep
mentioning Trudy.

353
00:21:13,783 --> 00:21:15,876
There was a witness
who heard a struggle.

354
00:21:15,952 --> 00:21:17,886
L-Lieutenant, let me- let me-
What's this?

355
00:21:17,954 --> 00:21:20,787
"Witness distinctly
heard victim say,

356
00:21:20,857 --> 00:21:23,155
'What are you doing, Trudy?"'

357
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,121
[Whispers]
Trudy.

358
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,434
That was Trudy's name.

359
00:21:41,744 --> 00:21:44,076
Mr. Monk, there's something
I need to tell you.

360
00:21:44,147 --> 00:21:45,375
Yeah.

361
00:21:46,516 --> 00:21:50,247
Lf... Mitch were...

362
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:53,152
somehow still alive,
I'd want somebody to tell me.

363
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,489
Tell you what? What?
What are you talking about?

364
00:21:59,195 --> 00:22:01,129
It's Trudy.

365
00:22:02,632 --> 00:22:04,566
She's not-

366
00:22:07,003 --> 00:22:08,994
She's not dead, Mr. Monk.

367
00:22:10,073 --> 00:22:12,735
Trudy?

368
00:22:14,377 --> 00:22:16,140
I've been following her.

369
00:22:19,248 --> 00:22:21,910
I talked to her.
[Scoffs]

370
00:22:21,984 --> 00:22:24,578
Well, this is-
I mean, that-This is just- Monk. Hey, Monk.

371
00:22:24,654 --> 00:22:28,055
Monk, I don't believe it either, okay?
But we don't know what's going on.

372
00:22:28,124 --> 00:22:31,491
Captain-
Look, M-Maybe if we just got- if we got a sample of her D.N.A.

373
00:22:31,561 --> 00:22:33,859
No. No!
No, that way we'd know where we stand.

374
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,864
Trudy's D.N.A.?
What are you saying?

375
00:22:35,932 --> 00:22:39,766
Maybe we could just exhume the body.
Look, we're miles away from exhuming anything.

376
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:43,033
She said she faked her
own death to protect you.

377
00:22:43,106 --> 00:22:45,472
She's alive, Mr. Monk.

[Gasping]

379
00:23:15,271 --> 00:23:17,466
Trudy.

380
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,167
Trudy!

[Tires Screeching]

00:23:31,621 --> 00:23:33,555
Trudy.

383

Monk,

384
00:23:51,707 --> 00:23:53,641
was it her?

385
00:23:59,248 --> 00:24:01,716
He's not sure.
She was too far away.

386
00:24:03,753 --> 00:24:05,687
Did you make the car?

387
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:08,847
S-Sedan.

388
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,456
<i>Gray sedan.</i>

389
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:15,520
What kind of sedan?

390
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,204
Did you see the driver?

391
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,703
The license number?
He doesn't remember.

[Sighs]

393
00:24:32,215 --> 00:24:34,149
Is there anything
I can do?

Is there anything...
I can do?

<i>Okay.</i> <i>Excellent.</i>

<i>Good.</i>

How's he doing?
How do you think he's doing?

398
00:24:52,335 --> 00:24:55,099
I have never felt more
helpless in my life.

399
00:24:55,171 --> 00:24:58,140
Well, I just spoke
to Hank Merchant at the D.A.'s office.

400
00:24:59,308 --> 00:25:01,299
Wait. Did I authorize that?
No, sir.

401
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:03,311
I figured
you wouldn't mind.

402
00:25:03,379 --> 00:25:05,313
I'm the man,
remember? [Sighs]

403
00:25:05,381 --> 00:25:07,315
I laid everything
out for him,

404
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:09,317
and he thinks
we have enough to exhume the body.

405
00:25:09,385 --> 00:25:11,751
You just have to
say the word. Look, hey, no, no.

We're not digging anything
up without Monk's okay.

Look-
Let's just give him a day or two, okay?

Doctor, thank God
you're here.

Oh, Natalie called my service.
What's going on?

411
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:27,165
<i>[Stottlemeyer]</i>
<i>There is some evidence to suggest...</i>

412

that Monk's wife, Trudy,
may still be alive.

Excuse me?

414
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:35,635
We think she faked her
own death and has been hiding out ever since.

415
00:25:35,711 --> 00:25:39,340
And we're pretty sure
she killed a guy earlier today. Trudy's our primary suspect.

416
00:25:39,415 --> 00:25:42,907
All right. All right.
So he's having a psychotic break. He's delusional.

417
00:25:42,985 --> 00:25:45,818
<i>No. He's not delusional.</i>
<i>We have two eyewitnesses...</i>

Adrian,

433

I'm not going
to believe anything until I hear it from you.

Is Trudy alive?

I don't know.

But if it's true,

437

nothing is true.

she contact me? I don't know.

I don't know.
Maybe she's in trouble.

relieved.

458
00:28:55,511 --> 00:28:57,945
I mean, I love her
with all my heart,

459
00:28:58,013 --> 00:28:59,947
but-

460
00:29:00,015 --> 00:29:02,040
[Sighs]

461
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:04,051
Who's this?

462
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,315
<i>This is my husband.</i>
<i>Ah.</i>

463
00:29:07,389 --> 00:29:10,449
I'm sure he's dead too.

464
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,687
And he'll stay dead.
Don't worry about that.

465
00:29:13,762 --> 00:29:16,162
This is an excellent cemetery.
They know what they're doing.

466
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:19,667
Everybody here-
probably dead.

467
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,704
Nice talking to you.

468
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:31,670
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

469
00:29:31,747 --> 00:29:34,341
That's it, there.
Trudy's desk?

470
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:36,350
For five years.

471
00:29:36,418 --> 00:29:38,545
She loved this job.

472
00:29:40,756 --> 00:29:42,690
I did that.

473
00:29:42,758 --> 00:29:44,953
<i>I was leaning in to kiss her,</i>

474
00:29:45,027 --> 00:29:46,961
spilled some coffee.
[Chuckles]

475
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:49,497
I bet it was the last
time you spilled anything in your life.

476
00:29:49,565 --> 00:29:53,524
Oh, I spilled something
seven years later- January 12, 1999.

477
00:29:53,602 --> 00:29:55,934
January 12? You mean
during the earthquake?

478
00:29:56,005 --> 00:29:59,907
Earthquakes count.
I don't make the rules.

479
00:30:01,944 --> 00:30:04,242
Mr. Monk, could I ask
you something?

480
00:30:04,313 --> 00:30:06,577
<i>What happened yesterday</i>
<i>in the cemetery?</i>

481
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,817
How do you know the woman
we've been seeing isn't Trudy?

482
00:30:10,886 --> 00:30:13,753
We still have one or two
copies in the archives. You can keep that one.

483
00:30:13,822 --> 00:30:16,416
I don't understand.
Why would anybody want to impersonate Trudy?

484
00:30:16,492 --> 00:30:20,428
I don't know.
I wish some of these kids would impersonate her a little bit.

485
00:30:20,496 --> 00:30:22,896
She was the best
reporter I ever knew.

486
00:30:22,965 --> 00:30:27,163
Here it is- "Peer Pressure"
byJanice Ellinghouse and Trudy Monk.

487
00:30:27,236 --> 00:30:30,433
It was the only article
they ever wrote together. It's a hell of a piece.

488
00:30:30,506 --> 00:30:32,030
<i>It should have won</i>
<i>a Pulitzer.</i> Yeah.

489
00:30:32,107 --> 00:30:35,907
- It was on the dockworkers' union?
- Ed Lindley, the union president, was indicted because of that.

490
00:30:35,978 --> 00:30:38,503
He's still in jail.
<i>That's right.</i> <i>The guy was untouchable.</i>

491
00:30:38,581 --> 00:30:42,449
But Trudy and Janice
never stopped digging. That article made history.

492
00:30:42,518 --> 00:30:45,009
<i>Lindley's second-in-command,</i>
<i>Jack Bollinger,</i>

493
00:30:45,087 --> 00:30:47,021
became the union president
because of this.

494
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:49,489
He's still there. Seems to be
running a pretty clean shop.

495
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:51,492
Whoa, they are really
naming names here.

496
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,255
Look at all these payoffs.

497
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:58,289
How did they get all this?
Hard work and a secret informant. Deep background.

498
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:00,358
Trudy never told <i>me</i>
who it was.

499
00:31:00,436 --> 00:31:02,836
Well, they never told me either.

500
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:04,964
Where was
Janice's desk?

501
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,134
Over there. Still haven't
cleaned it out yet.

502
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,576
It's, uh, hard to
say good-bye.

503
00:31:10,646 --> 00:31:12,580
Yes, it is.

504
00:31:23,626 --> 00:31:26,891
- "Pay rent."
- <i>Yeah, so?</i>

505
00:31:26,962 --> 00:31:29,192
She was already
paying a mortgage.

506
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:33,701
What could she be renting?
What-What-What can you rent for a hundred and five dollars?

507
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:37,728
I rent a storage locker.
It costs about that much per month.

508
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:44,709
The missing key-
the one from the book. It could have opened a locker.

509
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:50,116
Mr. Monk, there are hundreds
of storage lockers in San Francisco. Where would we even start?

510
00:31:50,185 --> 00:31:52,210
Well, Natalie,

511
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:55,848
how about
Trans-Cal Moving and Storage, 13025 Third Street?

512
00:31:55,924 --> 00:31:57,858
What?

513
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:04,565
Th-This storage place-
what time does it open?

514
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:07,466
<i>[Trudy] 8:00.</i>
I'm gonna need you to come along with me.

515
00:32:07,536 --> 00:32:11,199
Why? You said
once I got you the key, I could leave.

516
00:32:11,273 --> 00:32:14,401
Change of plans.
I don't know what kind of security they're gonna have.

517
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:17,741
If we're stopped,
I'm gonna need you to pretend to beJanice.

518
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:19,747
Oh, and bring that along.
She was a blonde too.

519
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:22,340
I hate this thing.
Why? It looks pretty good on you.

520
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:24,852
Then, you looked pretty good
as the redhead in that show.

521
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,445
<i>What was it</i>
<i>called again?</i> A man is dead.

522
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:32,226
Yeah, I know that.

523
00:32:32,294 --> 00:32:36,094
And I am sorry.
It was a terrible accident. And that other guy-Trudy's husband.

524
00:32:36,165 --> 00:32:39,931
I will never forget his face.
I mean, he was really hurting.

525
00:32:40,002 --> 00:32:41,936
Look, things happen.

526
00:32:42,004 --> 00:32:43,938
We're moving on.

527
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:46,702
This is all about
self-preservation now. Do you understand?

528
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:51,075
If whatever is in
that storage locker ever gets out, I am a dead man.

529
00:32:51,146 --> 00:32:53,080
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.

530
00:32:53,148 --> 00:32:56,709
Look-Look.
You're an actress, aren't you?

531
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:59,117
Well, our little show
is not over yet.

532
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:08,695
[Chattering]

533
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,303
[Stottlemeyer]
Good morning.

534
00:33:17,573 --> 00:33:21,304
What's going on?
Organizing a task force.

535
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:23,503
Out of my office?
Yes, sir.

536
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:27,345
Well, I figured
you wouldn't mind. I'm the man, right?

537
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:29,475
Yeah, that's right.
You're the man.

538
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:31,485
Don't worry, sir.
I am all over this one.

539
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:34,579
I've reassigned Rudner
and Sergeant Hyden. They're already on their way in.

540
00:33:34,656 --> 00:33:38,285
The report from the lab.
There were no identifiable prints in the apartment.

541
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,090
Trudy must have wiped
everything down before she left.

542
00:33:41,163 --> 00:33:43,358
I'm running off 5,000 of those-
"Wanted for Questioning."

543
00:33:43,432 --> 00:33:47,027
I put a photo of her
up on the hot board, and I've been trying to contact her parents.

544
00:33:48,203 --> 00:33:50,967
W-Wait, are you-
Wait. You've been trying to contact whose parents?

545
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,202
Trudy's. In case
she tries to call them. No, Randy. Wait, wait, wait-

546
00:33:54,276 --> 00:33:57,177
And I'm, uh,
releasing that to the press. It's a press release.

547
00:33:57,246 --> 00:34:01,012
Oh, uh, I called the deputy
commissioner too. Just want- Lieutenant!

548
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,017
Excuse me, gentlemen.

549
00:34:08,624 --> 00:34:10,558
[Groans]

550
00:34:13,195 --> 00:34:15,129
Randall,

551
00:34:15,197 --> 00:34:17,631
when I said that about-

552
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,963
about you being the man,

553
00:34:23,205 --> 00:34:25,139
I thought I was
talking to Monk.

554
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,614
Oh.

555
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:37,718
Okay.
Well, that explains it.

556
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:40,880
Randy, it doesn't mean
that I don't appreciate- No, l-I understand.

557
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:42,890
No problem.

558
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:45,017
Why don't I just get you
a cup of coffee?

559
00:34:47,095 --> 00:34:49,529
Won't be needing that.

560
00:34:50,766 --> 00:34:52,700
[Sighs]

561
00:35:08,116 --> 00:35:10,414
It's number 12.
Number 12. How do you know?

562
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:12,419
I saw the list.

563
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:14,421
The security guard just
showed you the list?

564
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:17,322
Not exactly.
I caught a glimpse of it as he was bending over.

565
00:35:17,392 --> 00:35:20,759
Why was he bending over?
To help me look for my earring.

566
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:24,822
[Gasps]
I lost my earring. Oh, my God.

567
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,165
It's irreplaceable.
It was a gift from my Aunt Lisa on her deathbed.

568
00:35:28,237 --> 00:35:30,831
I think it might have
fallen over there.

569
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,544
Maybe she's already been here.
No.

570
00:35:36,612 --> 00:35:40,981
There's water in the handle
from the rain last night.

571
00:35:41,049 --> 00:35:44,143
It would have spilled out
if she lifted the door.

572
00:35:45,754 --> 00:35:48,222
Listen. Listen.

573
00:35:53,095 --> 00:35:55,290
<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>That's the car I saw.</i>

574

It's gotta be her.
<i>Come on.</i>

575
00:35:57,366 --> 00:35:59,300
It's her. It's her.

576
00:36:07,476 --> 00:36:11,173
Mr. Monk, they're gonna see you.
What are you doing? Get down. I had her back.

577
00:36:11,246 --> 00:36:13,840
[Sighs]
For an hour and a half,

578
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:16,282
I thought she might be alive.
Psst.

579
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:25,022
[Exhales]
I had hope.

580
00:36:25,093 --> 00:36:27,653
Isn't hope the worst?

581
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:30,197
No, Mr. Monk.
Hope is a good thing.

582
00:36:31,266 --> 00:36:33,200
You're very young.

583
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,800
I know this guy.
I've seen him before.

584
00:36:41,877 --> 00:36:44,675
Do you have the article
that Trudy and Janice wrote? Yeah.

585
00:36:44,746 --> 00:36:46,145
<i>[Natalie]</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

586
00:36:46,214 --> 00:36:49,377
That's him.
Jack Bollinger.

587
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:53,046
- The union boss.
- <i>He was their anonymous source</i> <i>10 years ago.</i>

588
00:36:53,121 --> 00:36:56,113
<i>Now that they're both gone,</i>
<i>he must be panicked...</i>

589
00:36:56,191 --> 00:36:58,955
that all of their research material
will be made public.

590
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:03,698
And his old friends will know
that he ratted them out.

591
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,668
What about the woman?

592
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:09,863
Bollinger must have
just found her.

593
00:37:09,938 --> 00:37:13,567
It was a con game
to trickJanice's father into giving up that key.

594
00:37:13,642 --> 00:37:16,543
I don't get it.
How did she know so much about Trudy?

595
00:37:16,611 --> 00:37:18,545
Bollinger must have
coached her.

596
00:37:19,614 --> 00:37:22,048
He spent time with Trudy
when they were writing this,

597
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:24,278
so he knew a lot about her.

598
00:37:24,353 --> 00:37:26,287
I'm calling the captain.

<i>Lieutenant, we're rolling.</i> <i>That was Natalie.</i>

Were you talking to me?

It's just hard to tell sometimes.

00:37:48,944 --> 00:37:50,935
you know how fragile Monk is.

607
00:37:51,013 --> 00:37:54,244
I have to stroke him all the time.
But you're tougher than that.

608
00:37:54,316 --> 00:37:57,251
Come on.
You're the man. Let's go. Oh, so everybody's the man.

609
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,015
No. Just you and Monk.

610
00:38:01,089 --> 00:38:04,354
You're my <i>two</i> men.
Let's go.

611
00:38:04,426 --> 00:38:07,020
If we were both drowning,
who would you save?

612
00:38:07,095 --> 00:38:09,029
I don't know-
both of you.

613
00:38:09,097 --> 00:38:11,327
No, if you could
only save one of us.

614
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,268
I'd probably save Monk
because he can't swim, and I know you're an excellent swimmer.

615
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:17,271
Suppose I was
holding an anchor?

616
00:38:18,273 --> 00:38:21,037
You're holding an anchor?
Uh-huh. Who would you save then?

617
00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:24,306
Well, why don't you
let go of the anchor?

618
00:38:24,379 --> 00:38:26,370
It's a family heirloom.

619
00:38:28,984 --> 00:38:30,918
I'm leaving.

620
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:51,068
Mr. Bollinger,
can I go now? Go start the car.

621
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:53,266
No, no.
Mr. Monk, it's not Trudy.

622
00:38:53,341 --> 00:38:55,741
Let's just wait for
the captain. Just-

623
00:38:57,245 --> 00:38:59,839
Stay here.

624
00:38:59,915 --> 00:39:01,849
What the hell
are you doing?

625
00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:05,785
I found some notebooks
and some tapes, but they're not all labeled,

626
00:39:05,854 --> 00:39:08,516
and... I can't afford
to miss anything.

627
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,684
<i>So we...</i>

628
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,354
are going to Plan B.
Oh, Mr. -

629
00:39:14,429 --> 00:39:18,263
- Mr. Bollinger, you can't do that!
I don't want anyone else getting hurt. - Start the damn car!

630
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:20,130
Trudy?

631
00:39:20,202 --> 00:39:23,694
- What the hell is he doing here?
- I'm her husband.

632
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:31,106
<i>Son of a bitch, it never ends.</i>
<i>H- How did he find us?</i>

633
00:39:31,179 --> 00:39:33,909
<i>Who else knows we're here?</i>

634
00:39:33,982 --> 00:39:35,950
<i>Hey, I'm talking to you.</i>
Your hair-

635
00:39:36,017 --> 00:39:38,850
hair was more like- like-

636
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,286
[Stammering]
Look, l-I didn't know, okay?

637
00:39:41,356 --> 00:39:43,119
L-I thought this was just a job.

638
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,228
First row, number 12!
<i>[Tires Screeching]</i>

639
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,032
You, freak show,
get away from her.

640
00:39:54,102 --> 00:39:56,195
No, Mr. Bollinger, don't.
Trudy, listen.

641
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:58,967
Okay, that is enough!
No, no, no! Don't!

642
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,304
<i>Don't.!</i>

643
00:40:01,376 --> 00:40:03,310
<i>They're gonna find</i>
<i>a body in the ashes here.!</i>

644
00:40:03,378 --> 00:40:05,938
I have no choice!
He knows too much!

645
00:40:07,215 --> 00:40:09,206
- Oh, God.
- <i>[Stottlemeyer] Hey.!</i>

646
00:40:10,585 --> 00:40:12,849
[Yelps]

647
00:40:26,401 --> 00:40:29,837
[Groaning]

648
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:34,575
[Panting]

649
00:40:36,678 --> 00:40:38,703
Oh, I'm so sorry.

650
00:40:43,618 --> 00:40:45,552
You loved her.

651
00:40:50,192 --> 00:40:52,126
I'll tell her.

652
00:41:16,221 --> 00:41:18,485
<i>[Natalie]</i>
<i>Well, I think it stinks.</i> <i>What stinks?</i>

653
00:41:18,557 --> 00:41:20,491
The department deciding
not to reinstate you.

654
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:22,493
They didn't even
give you a chance.

655
00:41:22,561 --> 00:41:24,495
You can't really
blame them.

656
00:41:24,563 --> 00:41:27,532
After what happened,
I'm kind of back to-

657
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,533
What? Normal?

658
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:32,934
Well, to- to kind of normal.
Uh-

659
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:36,201
What?
Wait a second. Uh, I touched that one twice.

660
00:41:36,274 --> 00:41:38,208
I have to-

661
00:41:39,778 --> 00:41:41,973
You know, Mr. Monk,
you never told me.

662
00:41:42,047 --> 00:41:43,981
What happened
in the cemetery?

663
00:41:44,049 --> 00:41:46,779
How did you know
that that woman wasn't really Trudy?

664
00:41:47,852 --> 00:41:49,786
Well, I went to the grave,

665
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:53,016
and it still hurt.

666
00:41:53,091 --> 00:41:55,616
So I knew.

667
00:41:55,694 --> 00:41:57,628
Yeah, I know that hurt.

668
00:41:57,696 --> 00:42:00,256
It's never wrong.

669
00:42:00,332 --> 00:42:04,132
Nope. It isn't.
Neither are you.

670
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,404
