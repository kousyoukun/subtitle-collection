00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,640
Scott, we need to talk.

<font color="#00ffff">Don't, Mam.</font>

00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,640
<font color="#ffff00">Come on!</font>

6
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,200
<font color="#00ffff">Can we just go?</font>

7
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,000
<font color="#ffff00">Cheer up, pet.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">You're scaring the customers off.</font>

00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,800
Er, just to say
I hope everything went well.

13
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,800
Oh, I mean, as well as can
be expected, with your dad's move.

14
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,680
Er, you'll be with family,
so there's no need to call me back.

15
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,360
Right.

SHE SIGHS

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,280
Not the Sunday afternoon
we had planned, eh, Mark?

22
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,040
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. Body's in the chippie.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Discovered around 1pm by a worker.</font>

23
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,680
Oh. And is that her?
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

24
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,040
<font color="#ffff00">She says it's the co-owner,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Scott Rhodes.</font>

25
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,000
Co-owner?
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, the other's a Ross Simmons.</font>

26
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,480
<font color="#ffff00">Kenny's trying to contact him,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">but no answer yet.</font>

27
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,680
Oh, well, tell him to keep at it.

28
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,200
<font color="#ffff00">Er, we've got CCTV</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in the front of the shop,</font>

29
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,760
<font color="#ffff00">but only during opening hours.</font>

30
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,640
<font color="#ffff00">And you can access the kitchen</font>
<font color="#ffff00">from round the back anyway.</font>

31
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,600
Right.
And is that where the body is?

32
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,440
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, Ma'am. Er, you'd better take</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a look for yourself.</font>

33
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,840
All perfectly preserved for you.

34
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,680
<font color="#00ffff">Actually, it makes things tricky.</font>

35
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,000
<font color="#00ffff">He seems completely solid,</font>

36
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,880
<font color="#00ffff">so I'll need to gently unfreeze him</font>
<font color="#00ffff">before autopsy.</font>

37
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,080
Can you tell how long
he's been in there

38
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,320
from the level of freezing?

39
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,480
<font color="#00ffff">Not in any precise way.</font>

40
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,960
Was he dead when he went in? Hm?

41
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,520
Well, what about this blow
to the head?

42
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,120
<font color="#00ffff">Looks bad, but I can't be sure</font>
<font color="#00ffff">it's what killed him.</font>

43
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,760
Well, it couldn't have helped.

44
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,240
<font color="#00ffff">But it might have been the cold</font>
<font color="#00ffff">or suffocation.</font>

45
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,840
Or a fall.
Or hit with a heavy object.

46
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,680
<font color="#00ffff">Well, if you're hoping for</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a murder weapon,</font>

47
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,040
<font color="#00ffff">it seems a bit too clean in here.</font>

48
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,280
TOO clean?

49
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,480
<font color="#00ffff">Even for somewhere with</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a level 5 hygiene rating.</font>

50
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,680
Aye, and a dead body
in with the chips.

51
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,240
<font color="#00ffff">And look here.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Can we get the lights, please?</font>

52
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,400
Blood?<font color="#00ffff">Despite a strenuous</font>
<font color="#00ffff">clean-up effort, yes.</font>

53
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,880
<font color="#00ffff">Thanks.</font>

54
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,640
So, whatever happened
likely happened in here. Hmm.

55
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,720
Now, why would somebody
scrub the place clean thoroughly...

56
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,200
..and then leave the body
in the freezer?

57
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,000
<font color="#00ffff">I don't know.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">That's your department.</font>

58
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,680
<font color="#00ffff">We've got a card from a pocket.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Name on it's Scott Rhodes.</font>

59
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,760
<font color="#00ffff">And there's also a phone, but...</font>
Oh, that'll need defrosting too?

60
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,440
<font color="#00ffff">Er, no sign of forced entry,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">but they might have taken his keys.</font>

61
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,440
Did your lot unplug the freezer?

62
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,080
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

63
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,960
It was already unplugged
when he was found?

64
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,280
<font color="#00ffff">Not sure, but the freezer</font>
<font color="#00ffff">must've been running until recently.</font>

65
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,760
Hmm.

66
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,280
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry, I'm running late.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Joe.</font>

67
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,600
<font color="#ffff00">Is she inside?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Er, yeah. She's just in the front.</font>

68
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,960
SIGHS: What are you doing here?
<font color="#ffff00">I heard there was a dead body.</font>

69
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,120
You shouldn't be on call.

70
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,880
<font color="#ffff00">Me dad's settled in at the hospice.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">He's well looked after.</font>

71
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,880
<font color="#ffff00">There's nothing more I can do,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and I want to work.</font>

72
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,280
OK. Well, the deceased's
one of the co-owners,

73
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,680
and we're still looking for
the other one.

74
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,680
And I was wondering...

75
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,440
about this, too.

76
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,840
<font color="#ffff00">Cleared out before closing?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Or are you thinking burglary?</font>

77
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm thinking we need to check.

78
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,360
<font color="#00ff00">Scott was here last night.</font>
Steph?

79
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,720
What'd you get from the lass
who found his body?

80
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,400
<font color="#00ff00">Name's Rachel Lim, Ma'am.</font>

81
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,320
<font color="#00ff00">Lives nearby with her six-year-old.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">She's in a real state.</font>

82
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,640
<font color="#00ff00">But I got out of her</font>
<font color="#00ff00">that Scott Rhodes</font>

83
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,520
<font color="#00ff00">was here yesterday when she left.</font>

84
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,160
<font color="#00ff00">Shop closes at 11.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Rachel helped clean.</font>

85
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,480
<font color="#00ff00">She left around midnight.</font>

86
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,040
Why was she in today?
Shops shut on a Sunday.

87
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,720
<font color="#00ff00">Said she got worried about the gas.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Popped back to make sure it was off.</font>

88
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,920
<font color="#00ff00">Only to find the body.</font>

89
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,520
<font color="#ffff00">What about other workers?</font>

90
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,520
<font color="#00ff00">Er, yeah. An Ant Daleson</font>
<font color="#00ff00">was on yesterday,</font>

91
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,920
<font color="#00ff00">but he left earlier.</font>

92
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,240
<font color="#00ff00">Rachel said he's worked at the shop</font>
<font color="#00ff00">for years.</font>

93
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,400
<font color="#00ff00">And a Ross Simmons.</font>

94
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,400
So, both the owners, Ross and Scott,
were here when she left?

95
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,760
<font color="#00ff00">Er, no. Ross went a bit before.</font>

96
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,960
<font color="#00ff00">Mentioned wanting to get away</font>
<font color="#00ff00">for a drive down south,</font>

97
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,240
<font color="#00ff00">for a business meeting today.</font>

98
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,400
A business meeting? On a Sunday?

99
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,440
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, Kenny's still trying</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to contact him, Ma'am.</font> Good!

100
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,360
His business partner dead
in his freezer?

101
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,080
He's a person of interest
from the get-go. Kenny, any luck?

102
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,840
<font color="#00ffff">Er, sorry, Ma'am, no.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Just goes to his voicemail.</font>

103
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,080
He's turned it off.

104
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,520
<font color="#ffff00">All right, let's get an alert out.</font>
Aye.

105
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,320
Let's get his details
to the ports and airports,

106
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,240
and let's put a track
on his vehicle.

107
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,640
What about the deceased's
next of kin?

108
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,320
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, the homeowner</font>
<font color="#00ffff">at his registered address</font>

109
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,920
<font color="#00ffff">is a Carrie Hawton.</font>

110
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,360
<font color="#00ffff">Er, no-one home</font>
<font color="#00ffff">when uniform attended,</font>

111
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,560
<font color="#00ffff">but a neighbour said</font>
<font color="#00ffff">she'd be at work.</font>

112
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,480
Right.
Let's go find this Carrie Hawton.

113
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,720
Anything on Ross Simmons
I want updated as soon as.

114
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,640
<font color="#ffff00">Ma'am.</font>

115
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,280
BREATHES SHAKILY

116
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,080
I'm so sorry for your loss, pet.

117
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,320
Sit yourself down. Come on.

118
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,600
<font color="#00ffff">Do you need me, er, to do anything?</font>

119
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,000
Well, we will need a formal
identification at some point.

120
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,160
I mean, did he have any other family
we should contact?

121
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,520
<font color="#00ffff">No. It was just him.</font>

122
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,160
<font color="#00ffff">His dad died last year.</font>

123
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
<font color="#00ffff">That's when Scott moved back</font>
<font color="#00ffff">from London.</font>

124
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,960
<font color="#00ffff">We got together, and he moved in...</font>

125
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,640
<font color="#00ffff">six months back.</font>

126
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,240
<font color="#00ffff">I've a lad. Tyler.</font>

127
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,400
<font color="#00ffff">17 now.</font>

128
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,360
<font color="#00ffff">Scott was good with him.</font>

129
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,720
<font color="#00ffff">Not many men</font>
<font color="#00ffff">would've taken on a teenager.</font>

130
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,480
When did you last see Scott?

131
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,880
<font color="#00ffff">Yesterday teatime.</font>

132
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,760
<font color="#00ffff">I made chicken curry.</font>

133
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,720
<font color="#00ffff">Scott never really ate at the shop.</font>

134
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,760
<font color="#00ffff">He didn't like fish.</font>

135
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,360
<font color="#ffff00">And what time was that?</font>

136
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,680
<font color="#00ffff">Five-ish. I'd a shift from 6:30.</font>

137
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,480
You work overnight?
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

138
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,880
<font color="#00ffff">Finished at 2:30 in the morning.</font>

139
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,800
And when you got back,
was Scott home?

140
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,280
EXHALES
<font color="#00ffff">I don't know.</font>

141
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,000
<font color="#00ffff">When I'm back late,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I sleep on the sofa.</font>

142
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,640
<font color="#00ffff">I just assumed I'd missed him</font>
<font color="#00ffff">when I woke.</font>

143
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,520
<font color="#00ffff">Came in today for another shift.</font>

144
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,240
<font color="#ffff00">He hadn't called? Left a message?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">That didn't worry you?</font>

145
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,400
<font color="#00ffff">It's like that lately.</font>

146
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,560
<font color="#00ffff">Like ships in the night.</font>

147
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,440
<font color="#00ffff">What with my shift pattern</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and the chip shop being so full-on.</font>

148
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,720
Any problems at the shop?

149
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,680
<font color="#00ffff">I don't think so.</font>

150
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,240
<font color="#00ffff">Ask Ross Simmons.</font>

151
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,200
Oh, aye, aye. We will, pet.

152
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,480
Now, can you think of anything
out of the ordinary

153
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,880
that happened recently?

154
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,760
<font color="#00ffff">No. No, nothing.</font>

155
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,280
<font color="#00ffff">Well, his car got damaged,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I suppose.</font>

156
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,240
<font color="#00ffff">Outside ours. Scored down the side.</font>

157
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,880
<font color="#00ffff">And then a tyre got slashed.</font>

158
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,760
Any idea who did that?

159
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,520
<font color="#00ffff">Assumed just kids. Random.</font>

160
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,800
OK, pet. Thanks.

161
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,600
<font color="#ffff00">A partner with enough cash</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to rescue a small business,</font>

162
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,800
<font color="#ffff00">and she's working night shifts</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in a warehouse?</font>

163
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,160
Well, maybe she doesn't want
to rely on him?

164
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,040
I mean, six months living together
isn't that long.

165
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,640
And in any case, he wasn't stuffed
into their home freezer, was he?

166
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,080
We need Ross Simmons. What?

167
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,880
<font color="#ffff00">His car's been flagged</font>
<font color="#ffff00">several times driving south.</font>

168
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,120
Are they on to his bank card?

169
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,040
<font color="#ffff00">Well, yeah, but apart from buying</font>
<font color="#ffff00">some service station coffees...</font>

170
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,240
Yeah, well, what with that
and the camera sightings,

171
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,920
that should narrow the focus.

172
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,480
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, and Mark says Ant Daleson,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the other worker at the chip shop,</font>

173
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,800
<font color="#ffff00">he'll meet us at his home.</font>
Right.

174
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,720
Anthony Daleson?

175
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,560
<font color="#00ffff">You the police?</font>
Aye, we are, pet.

176
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,120
<font color="#00ffff">Ta, mate. See you again.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">All right.</font>

177
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,400
<font color="#00ffff">Sorry to keep you.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I had to get back from the hospital.</font>

178
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,640
Oh. Everything OK?
<font color="#00ffff">Hmm?</font>

179
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,560
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, not for me. My brother.</font>

180
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,080
<font color="#00ffff">Come in.</font>

181
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,480
And is your brother OK?

182
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,720
<font color="#00ffff">Er, yeah, now.</font>

183
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,680
<font color="#00ffff">Finn's epileptic.</font>

184
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,000
<font color="#00ffff">Had a seizure</font>
<font color="#00ffff">he wasn't quite coming out of.</font>

185
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,200
Well, we could've met you
at the hospital, pet.

186
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,080
<font color="#00ffff">Nah, you're all right.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Mum's with him.</font>

187
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,280
<font color="#00ffff">It's just Scott, you know?</font>

188
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,320
<font color="#00ffff">I mean, I just can't quite...</font>
Hmm.<font color="#00ffff">Ah.</font>

189
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,440
<font color="#00ffff">Have a seat.</font>

190
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,680
Oh, me mam had a little pot
like that.

191
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,360
<font color="#ffff00">You've worked at the chippy</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for a long time, Mr Daleson?</font>

192
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,600
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah. From right back</font>
<font color="#00ffff">when Mr and Mrs Simmons had it.</font>

193
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,320
<font color="#00ffff">After they retired, Ross took over.</font>

194
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,760
And that's when Scott Rhodes
came in as a co-owner?<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

195
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,960
<font color="#ffff00">We haven't been able to reach</font>
<font color="#ffff00">your boss.</font>

196
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,280
<font color="#ffff00">Have you any idea where he could be?</font>
Thanks, love.

197
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,120
<font color="#00ffff">Er, no. Sorry.</font>

198
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,520
<font color="#ffff00">Cheers.</font>

199
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,600
And were there any tensions
at the shop?

200
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,600
People got on?
<font color="#00ffff">Pretty much.</font>

201
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,080
<font color="#00ffff">Ross and Scott could argue a bit.</font>

202
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,360
Oh, aye? What about?

203
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,360
<font color="#00ffff">Er... the business.</font>

204
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,640
<font color="#ffff00">Were you there all day yesterday?</font>

205
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,400
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah. From food prep in t'morning.</font>

206
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,280
<font color="#00ffff">Er, Ross is in charge</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of the kitchen.</font>

207
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,520
<font color="#00ffff">Rachel came in early,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to wipe down before opening.</font>

208
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,800
And how long was Scott there?

209
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,400
<font color="#00ffff">Er, he stayed till... till closing.</font>

210
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,080
<font color="#00ffff">Ross let me get away early.</font>

211
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,720
<font color="#00ffff">Er, I usually stay to tidy up,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">but...</font>

212
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,560
<font color="#00ffff">..me brother'd been feeling funny,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and, erm...</font>

213
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,480
<font color="#00ffff">he had his seizures</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in the early hours.</font>

214
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,440
Oh, well,
he's in good hands now, love.

215
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,320
OK, listen up, everyone.
I know it's Sunday and all that.

216
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:22,040
Now, our deceased, Scott Rhodes,
co-owner of Simmons' Fish Shop.

217
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,080
He was a saviour who stopped it
from going under by all accounts.

218
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,880
And yet, he ends up dead,
in their own freezer.

219
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,840
Now, we're still trying to locate
the other owner, Ross Simmons.

220
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,400
The chippie was previously
the family's business.

221
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,880
And there may have been
some tensions

222
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,320
between Simmons and Rhodes.

223
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,280
<font color="#00ffff">Well, I've asked for a latest</font>
<font color="#00ffff">update on his whereabouts, Ma'am.</font>

224
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,600
<font color="#ffff00">Rachel Lim...</font>

225
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,240
<font color="#ffff00">and Ant Daleson.</font>

226
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,880
<font color="#ffff00">Both were there yesterday.</font>

227
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,240
<font color="#ffff00">She found the body</font>
<font color="#ffff00">just before 1pm today.</font>

228
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,680
Kenny, dig into his mobile,
social media.

229
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,080
See if there's any suggestion
of disagreements between these two.

230
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,800
<font color="#00ff00">Will do.</font>
Mark, start checking alibis.

231
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,480
Find out who had a key
to the place.<font color="#00ffff">Ma'am.</font>

232
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,840
<font color="#00ffff">Er, I've also retrieved</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the shop CCTV.</font> Good.

233
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,360
And finally...

234
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,480
Carrie Hawton,

235
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,640
who was the deceased's girlfriend.

236
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,840
Now, the poor lass
has lost her partner

237
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,880
and a father figure
to her teenage son.

238
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,400
<font color="#00ff00">Er, I did a quick background check</font>
<font color="#00ff00">into her, Ma'am.</font>

239
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,520
<font color="#00ff00">She's no previous,</font>

240
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,720
<font color="#00ff00">she's had the same address</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the last 15 years,</font>

241
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,800
<font color="#00ff00">since her parents died,</font>

242
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,080
<font color="#00ff00">and one sister,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">but she lives in Bristol.</font>

243
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,040
PHONE RINGS
Right. OK.

244
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,720
Go home, and I'll see you all
nice and early.

245
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,200
<font color="#00ffff">Ma'am. We've got Ross Simmons.</font>

246
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,880
<font color="#00ffff">A patrol car in South London</font>
<font color="#00ffff">pulled him over.</font>

247
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,000
I want him in that interview room
first thing tomorrow.

248
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,640
DOOR OPENS, CLOSES

249
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,040
Must've been worrying,
getting pulled over by the police.

250
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,040
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Is that why you kicked up a fuss?</font>

251
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,360
<font color="#ffff00">Refused to get out the car?</font>

252
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,960
<font color="#00ffff">Well, I'd had a glass of wine.</font>

253
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,640
<font color="#00ffff">Was worried that's why</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I'd been stopped.</font>

254
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,600
So, what was it took you down south?

255
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,040
<font color="#00ffff">Meeting a business contact.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Half business, half pleasure.</font>

256
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,600
<font color="#ffff00">We'll have to contact him.</font>

257
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,000
<font color="#00ffff">Of course.</font>

258
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,880
Now you two
hadn't been partners very long.

259
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,360
<font color="#00ffff">Half a year?</font>

260
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,120
<font color="#00ffff">We knew each other ages ago,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">from school.</font>

261
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,800
<font color="#00ffff">He'd moved away, done well.</font>

262
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,280
<font color="#00ffff">When he come home, he said</font>
<font color="#00ffff">he was looking for a new investment.</font>

263
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,760
<font color="#00ffff">I jumped at the chance.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Needed to refurb the shop.</font>

264
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,960
<font color="#ffff00">And you didn't have the capital</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for that?</font>

265
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,480
<font color="#00ffff">Mum and Dad took what they'd saved</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to Spain with them.</font>

266
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,920
<font color="#00ffff">They'd planned to let the place go.</font>

267
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,920
<font color="#00ffff">But I thought</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I could do something with it.</font>

268
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,160
<font color="#00ffff">It's been hard. The energy costs.</font>

269
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,400
<font color="#00ffff">Picked up some bad reviews</font>
<font color="#00ffff">online too. Didn't help.</font>

270
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,160
Well, that must have been stressful.

271
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,240
Now, you didn't lock up on Saturday.
Rachel did.

272
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,400
<font color="#00ffff">That's right, yeah.</font>

273
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,600
<font color="#00ffff">Just wanted to get home,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">get to bed before the drive,</font>

274
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,160
<font color="#00ffff">so I gave Rachel my keys.</font>

275
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,080
And both Rachel and Scott were there
when you left?

276
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,160
<font color="#ffff00">What about the till?</font>

277
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,160
<font color="#ffff00">Is it emptied</font>
<font color="#ffff00">at the end of every shift?</font>

278
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,680
<font color="#00ffff">Er, it should be, yeah.</font>

279
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,720
<font color="#00ffff">But so many payments</font>
<font color="#00ffff">are cashless these days,</font>

280
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,160
<font color="#00ffff">sometimes I just leave it.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I think I did on Saturday.</font>

281
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,440
<font color="#00ff00">Sorry, Ma'am.</font>
Excuse me, love.

282
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,200
<font color="#00ff00">It's the, erm, shop CCTV.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">There's something you should see.</font>

283
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,080
<font color="#00ff00">So, this is Saturday, 11:52,</font>

284
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,640
<font color="#00ff00">just before opening.</font>

285
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,520
Well, well, well.

286
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,960
So, nothing unusual happened?

287
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,960
Just a typical Saturday?

288
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,480
<font color="#ffff00">Who is that?</font>

289
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,760
<font color="#00ffff">Trevor Armley.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">We used to get fish off him.</font>

290
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,440
<font color="#00ffff">He wasn't happy when we stopped.</font>

291
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,720
We can see that, love.

292
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,160
Now, I'm gonna need his details.

293
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,240
<font color="#ffff00">We don't have enough to hold him.</font>
Ah, maybe not.

294
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,720
But we're not done
with Ross Simmons yet.

295
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,920
Let's see if we can confirm
he was at home

296
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,120
until his drive south on Sunday.

297
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,960
And meanwhile,
I need to talk to this fella...

298
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,040
Trevor Armley.

299
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,360
<font color="#ffff00">And Rachel Lim.</font>

300
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,200
<font color="#ffff00">She was the last person</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to see Scott.</font>

301
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,400
<font color="#ffff00">Still feels strange</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that she was there on a Sunday,</font>

302
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,840
<font color="#ffff00">when she wouldn't normally</font>
<font color="#ffff00">have keys.</font>

303
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,040
Aye, you're right.
You go see her. Take Steph with you.

304
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,600
I'll go talk to this fisherman.

305
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,080
And, Mark?

306
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,440
See if you can trace
any rotten online reviews

307
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,880
the chip shop apparently got.

308
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,320
<font color="#00ff00">Ma'am.</font>

309
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,600
Now, come on, love.
I mean, it's pretty clear.

310
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,560
<font color="#ffff00">Scott report me to you lot, did he?</font>
Ah, no, no. No, love.

311
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,160
No, he's been found murdered.

312
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,320
So you can imagine
this gesture of yours

313
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,480
has us asking questions.

314
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,080
<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

315
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,680
<font color="#ffff00">No, I... I wasn't...</font>

316
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,000
<font color="#ffff00">I was saying</font>
<font color="#ffff00">their business would be dead.</font>

317
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,800
<font color="#ffff00">Scott behaving that way.</font>
In what way, love?

318
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,120
<font color="#ffff00">I run as a small operation, right?</font>

319
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,680
<font color="#ffff00">A day boat my sons take out.</font>

320
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,040
<font color="#ffff00">I deliver fish, fresh.</font>

321
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,240
<font color="#ffff00">Ross loved</font>
<font color="#ffff00">how it would fit his vision.</font>

322
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,000
<font color="#ffff00">Fresh, local.</font>

323
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,160
<font color="#ffff00">Sustainable.</font>

324
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,680
Ah, but he'd stopped using you.
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

325
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,880
<font color="#ffff00">Before the end</font>
<font color="#ffff00">of the initial agreement.</font>

326
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,880
<font color="#ffff00">On Scott's say-so,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Ross just rolled over.</font>

327
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,000
<font color="#ffff00">Kept saying that Scott</font>
<font color="#ffff00">was the money brain.</font>

328
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,480
So, what's this, then, hmm?
Dispute resolution?

329
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,160
<font color="#ffff00">I called Scott.</font>

330
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,480
<font color="#ffff00">He ignored me.</font>

331
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,760
<font color="#ffff00">Was slippery, that one.</font>

332
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,480
<font color="#ffff00">Now the next thing I hear,</font>

333
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,600
<font color="#ffff00">he's spreading rumours about</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the sustainability of our fish.</font>

334
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,400
Any truth in those rumours?
<font color="#ffff00">No!</font>

335
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,800
<font color="#ffff00">But if our accreditation</font>
<font color="#ffff00">gets suspended...</font>

336
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,160
<font color="#ffff00">that is a disaster. You just...</font>

337
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,640
<font color="#ffff00">You don't do that.</font>

338
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,960
What about the rest of the day?
Where were you?

339
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,520
Did you see Scott again?
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

340
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,200
<font color="#ffff00">I was back here.</font>

341
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,520
<font color="#ffff00">Then I was at a friend's till late.</font>

342
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,960
<font color="#ffff00">A poker night.</font>

343
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,720
<font color="#ffff00">You can ask the lads.</font>

344
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,120
Oh, I will, love.

345
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,680
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Rachel Lim?</font>

346
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,000
<font color="#ffff00">Northumberland and City Police.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Can we have a word?</font>

347
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,160
DOOR BUZZES

348
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,120
DOOR CLOSING

349
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,320
<font color="#00ffff">Sorry about this.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I'll clear it up for you.</font>

350
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,960
<font color="#00ff00">No, you're fine.</font>

351
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,800
<font color="#00ff00">Er, so, you told me yesterday</font>

352
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,640
<font color="#00ff00">you went back to check</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the gas was off.</font>

353
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,080
<font color="#00ffff">Er... yeah.</font>

354
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,960
<font color="#ffff00">Why did you think that Scott</font>
<font color="#ffff00">or Ant hadn't done it?</font>

355
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,560
<font color="#00ffff">Because Ross had asked me</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to lock up.</font>

356
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,040
<font color="#00ffff">But as Scott was still there,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">he said he'd do it.</font>

357
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,720
<font color="#00ffff">He'd normally be long gone by then.</font>

358
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,920
<font color="#00ffff">I just wanted to make sure</font>
<font color="#00ffff">it'd been done.</font>

359
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,400
<font color="#00ffff">I felt responsible.</font>

360
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,440
<font color="#ffff00">Did you notice that the till</font>
<font color="#ffff00">had been emptied?</font>

361
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,400
<font color="#00ffff">Ross normally clears it.</font>

362
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,080
<font color="#ffff00">Just didn't on Saturday.</font>

363
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,720
<font color="#00ffff">Are you accusing me of something?</font>

364
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,440
<font color="#00ff00">You unexpectedly found yourself</font>
<font color="#00ff00">with the keys,</font>

365
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,280
<font color="#00ff00">knew no-one would be in Sunday,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and now the till's empty.</font>

366
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,400
<font color="#00ffff">Scott used to take money from it.</font>

367
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,560
<font color="#ffff00">From the till?</font>

368
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
<font color="#ffff00">The co-owner?</font>

369
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,160
<font color="#00ffff">On top of taking advantage of us.</font>

370
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,720
<font color="#ffff00">Taking advantage how?</font>

371
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,840
<font color="#00ffff">I worked at Helliwell's before.</font>

372
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,680
<font color="#00ffff">The chip shop</font>
<font color="#00ffff">at the other end of the road.</font>

373
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,440
<font color="#00ffff">Scott poached me.</font>

374
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,640
<font color="#00ffff">Offered me more shifts</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and a pay rise.</font>

375
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,640
<font color="#00ffff">Instead, I got fewer shifts</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and less money.</font>

376
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,960
<font color="#00ffff">He did it to annoy Pat Helliwell.</font>

377
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,560
<font color="#00ff00">And why would he want to do that?</font>

378
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,840
<font color="#00ffff">Because Pat and him</font>
<font color="#00ffff">don't like each other.</font>

379
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,400
<font color="#00ffff">And he hated that the Helliwells</font>
<font color="#00ffff">got more business.</font>

380
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,480
<font color="#00ffff">What he paid was below minimum.</font>

381
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
<font color="#00ffff">Weren't legal.</font>

382
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,720
<font color="#ffff00">Well, neither's taking money</font>
<font color="#ffff00">from the till.</font>

383
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,560
<font color="#ffff00">You said that Scott</font>
<font color="#ffff00">would normally be gone.</font>

384
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,120
<font color="#ffff00">So why hadn't he on Saturday?</font>

385
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,160
<font color="#ffff00">And when you were in there</font>
<font color="#ffff00">yesterday,</font>

386
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,560
<font color="#ffff00">why did you open the freezer?</font>

387
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,480
<font color="#00ffff">To let it defrost.</font>

388
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,640
<font color="#00ffff">I wanted the fish to go off.</font>

389
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,560
<font color="#00ffff">I figured any waste</font>
<font color="#00ffff">would annoy Scott.</font>

390
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,000
<font color="#00ffff">Look, I was just angry</font>
<font color="#00ffff">at the way he treated us. OK?</font>

391
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,480
MARK:<font color="#ffff00">Printouts of the bad reviews</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the chip shop got, Ma'am.</font>

392

<font color="#ffff00">All within the past few months.</font>

393
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,920
<font color="#ffff00">But they're pretty vicious.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">It's more like trolling.</font>

394
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,080
Are we sure these are genuine?

395
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,120
<font color="#ffff00">Well, there's a few different names.</font>

396
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,480
Well, that's no guarantee

397
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,320
they're not all written
by the same person.

398
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,960
Check for any similarities
in grammar, spelling, punctuation.

399
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,560
And get on to the cyber team.

400
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,560
Maybe they can tell us
who posted them.<font color="#ffff00">Ma'am.</font>

401
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,440
And Kenny?

402
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,200
Can you fast track
the shop's finances, please?

403
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,600
Personal accounts too.
<font color="#00ffff">Ma'am.</font>

404
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,880
<font color="#ffff00">Definitely something funny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">going on in that shop.</font>

405
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,960
What?

406
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,360
<font color="#00ff00">It was Rachel</font>
<font color="#00ff00">who switched off the freezer</font>

407
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,040
<font color="#00ff00">because Scott</font>
<font color="#00ff00">was short-changing them.</font>

408
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,080
<font color="#00ff00">Said she wanted everything to spoil,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">so she opened the lid.</font>

409
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
<font color="#ffff00">And listen to this.</font>

410
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,800
<font color="#ffff00">She used to work for Pat Helliwell,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that rival chip shop.</font>

411
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,600
<font color="#ffff00">Scott poached Rachel from her.</font>

412
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,440
<font color="#ffff00">Seems there was some bad blood</font>
<font color="#ffff00">between them.</font>

413
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,920
Right.

414
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,320
So, let's go get some chips.

415
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,840
<font color="#00ffff">So, how long are your lot</font>
<font color="#00ffff">gonna be hanging around for?</font>

416
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,560
<font color="#00ffff">It's hardly good for business,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">police officers everywhere.</font>

417
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,520
Well, neither is murder, love.

418
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,160
<font color="#00ffff">He was murdered? Scott?</font>

419
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,040
<font color="#ffff00">We heard the two of you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">had some issues.</font>

420
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,240
PAT SCOFFS
<font color="#00ffff">Right.</font>

421
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,480
<font color="#00ffff">So, now someone's taking me</font>
<font color="#00ffff">seriously?</font>

422
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,920
<font color="#00ffff">Do you know, I tried to tell</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the council about all this.</font>

423
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,200
<font color="#00ffff">Salt and vinegar?</font>
Please.

424
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,120
So, come on.
What had you going to the council?

425
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,120
<font color="#00ffff">Look, I've had a shop on the same</font>
<font color="#00ffff">street as Simmons for decades.</font>

426
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,320
<font color="#00ffff">Now, there's a bit</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of friendly rivalry, you know,</font>

427
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,320
<font color="#00ffff">but never any problems.</font>

428
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,760
<font color="#00ffff">Until Scott Rhodes.</font>

429
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,880
<font color="#00ffff">He was trying to drive me</font>
<font color="#00ffff">out of business, simple as that.</font>

430
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,400
<font color="#ffff00">And how'd he go about that?</font>

431
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,320
<font color="#00ffff">You name it.</font>

432
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,920
<font color="#00ffff">Dirty tricks.</font>

433
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,280
<font color="#00ffff">Right... He stole the staff.</font>

434
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,160
<font color="#00ffff">Used my bins until they overflowed.</font>

435
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,200
<font color="#00ffff">He even tried to steal my customers</font>
<font color="#00ffff">out of the queue.</font>

436
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,760
<font color="#00ffff">And...</font>

437
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,640
<font color="#00ffff">And there was even...</font>
UNDER BREATH:<font color="#00ffff">..a dead rat.</font>

438
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,920
<font color="#ffff00">A rat?</font>

439
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,600
<font color="#00ffff">Found its way into my kitchen.</font>

440
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,120
What, and that was Scott Rhodes
as well, was it?

441
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,880
<font color="#00ffff">Well, how else did it get in?</font>

442
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,880
Well, I wouldn't like to speculate,
love.

443
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,960
<font color="#00ffff">Look, love, my shop is clean, right?</font>

444
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,240
<font color="#00ffff">Squeaky.</font>

445
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,200
<font color="#00ffff">I've even had the whole kitchen</font>
<font color="#00ffff">refitted a month ago.</font>

446
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,120
<font color="#00ffff">Everything in there is gleaming.</font>

447
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,760
Well, I'm pleased to hear it.

448
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,960
Thanks, love.

449
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,840
<font color="#00ffff">I kept it.</font>

450
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
What?

451
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,280
WHISPERS:<font color="#00ffff">Rat.</font>

452
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,480
<font color="#00ffff">I froze it.</font>

453
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,280
<font color="#00ffff">So, if you wanna analyse it</font>
<font color="#00ffff">you know, forensics or whatever...?</font>

454
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,520
No, you're all right, pet.
<font color="#00ffff">OK.</font>

455
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,320
<font color="#ffff00">Not finishing those, then?</font>

456
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,400
Check with the council.

457
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,320
See if she actually did
raise complaints.

458
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,920
PHONE RINGS

459
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,840
Kenny, what's up?

460
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,400
<font color="#00ffff">Er, something from Scott's mobile,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Ma'am.</font>

461
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,040
<font color="#00ffff">There's some texts from</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a few weeks back that jump out.</font>

462
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,360
Jump out? Why?

463
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,400
<font color="#00ffff">One is to a contact called</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Ollie Keeble.</font>

464
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,280
<font color="#00ffff">There's Scott telling him</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to back off from Carrie.</font>

465
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,200
So, who is this Ollie Keeble?

466
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,920
<font color="#00ff00">That's for hogging the ball, mate.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I'll pass it back.</font>

467
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,520
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, right.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I scored, didn't I?</font>

468
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,360
<font color="#ffff00">That's Ollie over there,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in the burgundy top.</font>

469
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,120
Right, thanks, love.

470
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,560
ARGUING

471
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,920
MAN:<font color="#00ffff">Hey. Hey!</font>

472
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,720
<font color="#00ffff">Tyler, break it up. Break it up now.</font>

473
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,360
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

474
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,960
<font color="#00ffff">Tyler told me about Scott.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">It's awful.</font>

475
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,560
Tyler?

476
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,160
Carrie Hawton's lad?

477
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,320
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah. He's one of the lads</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that's just been scrapping.</font>

478
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,200
<font color="#00ffff">But I didn't have much to do</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with Scott.</font>

479
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,320
JOE:<font color="#ffff00">No?</font>

480
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,640
<font color="#ffff00">"I know you want her, mate. Unlucky.</font>

481
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,160
<font color="#ffff00">"She's mine."</font>

482
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,360
Now, why would he send you
those texts

483
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,720
about you and his missus
if you barely knew him?

484
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,960
<font color="#00ffff">Tyler has some issues</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with his temper.</font>

485
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,480
<font color="#00ffff">They've gotten worse.</font>

486
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,800
<font color="#00ffff">So I spoke to Scott.</font>

487
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,240
<font color="#00ffff">Wondered if something</font>
<font color="#00ffff">was going on at home.</font>

488
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,920
And he reacted badly?

489
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,520
<font color="#00ffff">Told me to get my nose out</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and then...</font>

490
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,720
<font color="#00ffff">Well, you've seen.</font>

491
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,560
<font color="#00ffff">Must have got my number from Carrie.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Started behaving like a bully.</font>

492
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,240
<font color="#ffff00">You ever been in a relationship</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with Carrie?</font>

493
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,520
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

494
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,720
<font color="#00ffff">Scott THOUGHT I liked her, but...</font>

495
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,400
<font color="#00ffff">Look... I just want what's best</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for Tyler.</font>

496
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,880
<font color="#00ffff">I want him to be a top footballer.</font>

497
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,120
He's good, is he? Tyler?
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah. Very.</font>

498
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,800
<font color="#00ffff">Could be a big thing for him</font>
<font color="#00ffff">if he got scouted, but...</font>

499
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,640
<font color="#00ffff">he's his own worst enemy.</font>

500
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,040
<font color="#00ffff">Now, if you don't mind,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I need to get this lot stashed away.</font>

501
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,120
So which version of Scott Rhodes
do we believe?

502
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,800
Hmm?
A successful businessman who saves

503
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,240
an old friend's family business
from going under?

504
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,320
Or, someone who pinches his rival
staff and underpays his workers?

505
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,000
<font color="#ffff00">He took on an angry teenage lad.</font>

506
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,920
<font color="#ffff00">Carrie said he was good with him.</font>

507
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,680
<font color="#00ffff">Er, I looked into his family.</font>

508
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,240
<font color="#00ffff">No living relatives.</font>

509
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,760
<font color="#00ffff">The dad died last year</font>
<font color="#00ffff">like Carrie said.</font>

510
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,960
<font color="#00ffff">Scott sold his house</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and inherited his car.</font>

511
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,040
<font color="#00ff00">So maybe he used the money from the</font>
<font color="#00ff00">house, to put into the chip shop.</font>

512
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,560
But he was already well set up,
wasn't he?

513
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,880
<font color="#00ff00">Er, no. He was in debt, ma'am.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Quite bad, actually.</font>

514
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,320
<font color="#00ff00">He had an Individual</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Voluntary Arrangement</font>

515
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,120
<font color="#00ff00">set up to pay off some creditors.</font>

516
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,600
<font color="#ffff00">Well, that's definitely not</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the image he was selling.</font>

517
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,600
<font color="#00ff00">Er, might not be connected, ma'am,</font>

518
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,400
<font color="#00ff00">but Scott's phone</font>
<font color="#00ff00">over the last few months,</font>

519
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,280
<font color="#00ff00">there been a regularity of calls to</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a contact listed as "New Supplier".</font>

520
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,280
<font color="#00ff00">Long conversations, too.</font>

521
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,960
Well, did you trace the number?
<font color="#00ff00">Not yet, ma'am.</font>

522
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,360
<font color="#00ff00">Get it up on his handset.</font>

523
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,160
<font color="#00ff00">New supplier.</font>

524
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,000
I'm gonna ring it!

525
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,600
RINGING TONE

526
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,320
WOMAN:<font color="#00ff00">'Babe! I've missed you!</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Where've you been?'</font>

527
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,800
Who am I speaking too?

528
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,360
<font color="#00ff00">'Who are you?'</font>

529
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,320
Detective Chief Inspector
Vera Stanhope, love.

530
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,720
Northumberland and City Police.

531
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,560
And we're going to need
a little chat.

532
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:03,640
<font color="#00ff00">No. No.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I spoke to him on the weekend.</font>

533
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,280
<font color="#ffff00">We saw. On Saturday.</font>

534
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,600
<font color="#00ff00">I tried Sunday.</font>

535
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,920
<font color="#00ff00">Didn't answer.</font>

536
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,160
<font color="#ffff00">Didn't leave a voicemail?</font>

537
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,880
<font color="#ffff00">Didn't text to see if he was OK?</font>

538
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,720
In fact, you never texted him.

539
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,160
<font color="#00ff00">He said not to.</font>

540
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,320
And you know why, don't you love?

541
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,800
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah.</font>

542
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,000
<font color="#00ff00">Because of his... home situation.</font>

543
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,520
<font color="#00ff00">But he was sorting it.</font>

544
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,960
<font color="#ffff00">He told you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">he was gonna leave his partner?</font>

545
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,920
And did you believe
he was gonna do that?

546
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,680
<font color="#00ff00">Course he was!</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Why wouldn't he, when he knew...</font>

547
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,840
How far along are you, pet?

548
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,560
<font color="#00ff00">Seven weeks.</font>

549
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,040
<font color="#00ff00">He was honest from the start.</font>

550
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,360
<font color="#00ff00">But there was a kid at home.</font>

551
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
<font color="#00ff00">Looked up to Scott.</font>

552
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,000
<font color="#ffff00">So, he had to let them down gently?</font>

553
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,880
<font color="#00ff00">Yes! Because he cared!</font>

554
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,440
<font color="#00ff00">About me. Them.</font>

555
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
<font color="#00ff00">Had so much on his plate.</font>

556
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,040
<font color="#00ff00">The young people he mentored.</font>

557
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,280
<font color="#00ff00">He visited an old woman.</font>

558
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,880
<font color="#00ff00">Had the staff at the restaurant</font>
<font color="#00ff00">to look after.</font>

559
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,720
Did you ever go to the chippie?

560
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,920
<font color="#00ff00">Chippie?</font>
Aye.

561
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,840
<font color="#00ff00">You mean, the fish restaurant?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">No. I never went.</font>

562
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,400
<font color="#00ff00">What am I gonna do?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Who would hurt him?</font>

563
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,560
<font color="#00ff00">He was just a lovely,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">caring, decent man.</font>

564
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,360
He really was a piece of work,
wasn't he?

565
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,600
Lining her up to replace Carrie!

566
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,920
<font color="#ffff00">Aye. But younger.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">More money he could tap.</font>

567
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,080
<font color="#ffff00">Carrying his own bairn.</font>

568
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,440
<font color="#ffff00">Just how he would have seen it.</font>

569
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,160
<font color="#ffff00">What if Carrie found out?</font>

570
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,640
Aye. Or Tyler.

571
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,760
ENGINE STARTS

572
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,040
Carrie?
<font color="#00ffff">Hmm.</font>

573
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,920
<font color="#00ffff">So, first you're telling me</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Scott was drowning in debt.</font>

574
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,440
<font color="#00ffff">And now that?</font>

575
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,320
We are so sorry, love.

576
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,640
<font color="#00ffff">With who?</font>

577
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,920
<font color="#00ffff">What? You won't tell me?</font>

578
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,280
<font color="#ffff00">Well, it wouldn't be appropriate.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Appropriate?</font>

579
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,600
You didn't suspect
he had money troubles?

580
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,240
Not even when he was keen
to move in here?

581
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,920
And you never wondered
if he was cheating?

582
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,360
<font color="#00ffff">No. I didn't.</font>

583
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,320
<font color="#00ffff">If that's all you came for...</font>

584
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,040
Is your son home, love?

585
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,560
<font color="#00ffff">Tyler? Why?</font>

586
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,160
He was part of Scott's life.

587
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,360
We need to talk to everyone.

588
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,560
<font color="#00ffff">Now?</font>
Aye.

589
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,000
<font color="#00ffff">Tyler? Can you come down?</font>

590
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,240
SOMEBODY COMING DOWNSTAIRS

591
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,800
Oh, pleased to meet you, love.

592
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,760
I'm DCI Stanhope.

593
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,560
This is DI Ashworth.

594
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,360
<font color="#00ff00">What do you want?</font>

595
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,720
Well, I want to hear about Scott
from you, love.

596
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,840
Did you get on?
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah.</font>

597
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,160
<font color="#00ff00">Mum seemed happy.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">They say he was cheating.</font>

598
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,440
<font color="#00ff00">What? Seriously?</font>

599
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,960
<font color="#ffff00">You didn't know?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Of course not!</font>

600
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,640
<font color="#00ff00">I'd have told mum!</font>

601
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,280
<font color="#00ff00">He was the one worried about that.</font>

602
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,080
What do you mean?

603
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,240
<font color="#00ff00">He made jokes.</font>

604
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,760
<font color="#00ff00">Said one of my coaches was</font>
<font color="#00ff00">in love with Mum.</font> Ollie Keeble?

605
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,600
But there was nothing was
going on there, was there, pet?

606
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,080
<font color="#00ffff">Don't be ridiculous. No.</font>

607
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,600
Are you sure about that?
<font color="#00ffff">Aye.</font>

608
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,880
OK. Thanks for your time.

609
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,480
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't spot any big anger</font>
<font color="#ffff00">issues from the kid. Did you?</font>

610
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,760
Well, maybe it only comes out
on the football pitch.

611
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,920
<font color="#ffff00">What is it?</font>

612
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,480
Domestic CCTV.

613
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,560
CCTV.

614
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,280
And I'm pretty sure it covers
Carrie Hawton's house.

615
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
Check her movements for Saturday.

616
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,880
And that of her lad, Tyler.

617
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,840
He said he went to see a mate
round about five.

618
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,480
And check the days Carrie
thinks Scott's car was damaged.

619
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,000
<font color="#00ff00">Ma'am.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Oh. and er, postmortem, ma'am.</font>

620
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,520
<font color="#00ff00">Paula's ready for you.</font>

621
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,320
At last! Right, you coming?

622
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,600
Finally got him thawed, then?

623
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,080
<font color="#00ffff">It's trickier than just</font>
<font color="#00ffff">popping him in the microwave.</font>

624
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,720
<font color="#ffff00">So, what you got for us, then?</font>

625
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,080
<font color="#00ff00">Well, first off, there's no</font>
<font color="#00ff00">vasoconstriction or petechiae.</font>

626
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,280
<font color="#00ff00">So, he didn't suffocate.</font>

627
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,040
<font color="#00ff00">He was dead</font>
<font color="#00ff00">before he went into the freezer.</font>

628
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,440
Was it this whack
to the head that killed him?

629
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,160
<font color="#00ff00">It's possible.</font>

630
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,520
Well, any idea how it was inflicted?

631
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,240
<font color="#00ff00">There was nothing embedded</font>
<font color="#00ff00">in the wound.</font>

632
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,840
<font color="#00ff00">So, something metal.</font>

633
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,600
<font color="#00ff00">Stainless steel, perhaps.</font>

634
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,000
<font color="#00ff00">And yes, it caused a skull fracture,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">brain contusion</font>

635
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,600
<font color="#00ff00">and a subarachnoid haemorrhage.</font>

636
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,800
<font color="#00ff00">Oh, and there's something else too.</font>
What?

637
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,440
<font color="#00ff00">I only saw once he was thawed</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and undressed.</font>

638
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,520
<font color="#00ff00">Penetrating trauma.</font>

639
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,000
<font color="#00ff00">Caused an intra-abdominal</font>
<font color="#00ff00">vascular injury.</font>

640
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,840
<font color="#ffff00">A knife wound?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">From a thin blade, yes.</font>

641
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,200
<font color="#00ff00">Damaged his right renal artery.</font>

642
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,120
<font color="#00ff00">He'd have bled out pretty quickly.</font>

643
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,880
And that's what killed him?

644
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,600
<font color="#00ff00">Either trauma could have.</font>

645
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,800
<font color="#00ff00">The knife wound</font>
<font color="#00ff00">probably be more lethal.</font>

646
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,240
But impossible to tell
which was inflicted first.

647
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,920
<font color="#ffff00">So, he was hit then stabbed.</font>

648
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,280
<font color="#ffff00">Or stabbed then hit.</font>
Or both together?

649
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,200
Whack. Stab.

650
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,560
<font color="#00ff00">Very balletic.</font>

651
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,960
<font color="#00ff00">You can see it's tricky.</font>

652
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,160
<font color="#00ff00">Though you've the right idea</font>
<font color="#00ff00">on angles.</font>

653
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,840
<font color="#00ff00">The blow to the head and the depth</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and direction of the stab</font>

654
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,200
<font color="#00ff00">suggest both attacks were delivered</font>
<font color="#00ff00">from the front, facing the deceased.</font>

655
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,920
<font color="#00ff00">And now you're seeing</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the other problem.</font>

656
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,800
<font color="#ffff00">The top blows</font>
<font color="#ffff00">on the left of his head,</font>

657
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,320
<font color="#ffff00">the stab on the bottom right.</font>

658
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,200
<font color="#00ff00">One would be delivered by</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a non-dominant hand.</font>

659
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,640
<font color="#00ff00">Or we have an ambidextrous killer.</font>

660
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,960
Or there where two assailants.

661
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,960
<font color="#00ff00">You hardly need me here.</font>

662
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,600
But anything else?

663
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,360
<font color="#00ff00">Just time of death.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I can narrow it down for you,</font>

664
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,560
<font color="#00ff00">if you find out</font>
<font color="#00ff00">when he last had chicken curry.</font>

665
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,520
Well, I can tell you that.
It was about 5pm on Saturday.

666
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,600
<font color="#00ff00">Then judging by how digested</font>
<font color="#00ff00">his stomach contents were,</font>

667
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,280
<font color="#00ff00">I'm pretty confident he died</font>
<font color="#00ff00">between 11pm Saturday</font>

668
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,600
<font color="#00ff00">and 2am Sunday morning.</font>

669
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,600
Right. Thanks, Paula.

670
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,760
One useful thing, anyway.

671
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,920
OK. So, the postmortem
has helped, timeframe-wise.

672
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:43,160
And we've discovered apart from
his head wound, he was also stabbed.

673
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,240
<font color="#ffff00">Whilst throwing the curveball,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">we might have two assailants.</font>

674
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,880
So, we're looking at pairings
with motive and opportunity.

675
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,320
Now Kenny, have we confirmed
the alibi of the girlfriend, Carrie?

676
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,720
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, the warehouse confirmed</font>
<font color="#00ff00">she showed up for her shift.</font>

677
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,640
<font color="#00ffff">And er, I've started on</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the camera's covering her house.</font>

678
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,880
<font color="#00ffff">Er, we've got her leaving and</font>
<font color="#00ffff">returning at the times she told us.</font>

679
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,640
Yeah. What about her lad, Tyler?

680
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,360
<font color="#00ffff">Er, yeah, got him leaving, too.</font>

681
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,240
<font color="#00ff00">I talked to the friend, and he</font>
<font color="#00ff00">confirmed that Tyler crashed there.</font>

682
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,160
<font color="#ffff00">And the fish supplier, Trevor,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">was at his poker night.</font>

683
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,600
OK, shop workers.

684
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,880
Ant Daleson?

685
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,720
<font color="#00ff00">Well, his mother confirms</font>
<font color="#00ff00">he was home,</font>

686
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,400
<font color="#00ff00">until he had to rush off to the</font>
<font color="#00ff00">hospital for his brother, Finlay.</font>

687
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,440
<font color="#00ff00">I confirmed the admission time</font>
<font color="#00ff00">with the hospital.</font>

688
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,680
<font color="#ffff00">Rachel and Ross Simmons</font>
<font color="#ffff00">are a bit harder.</font>

689
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,160
<font color="#00ffff">Rachel picked her boy, Matthew, up,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">from a friend's around 12.</font>

690
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,960
Ah, well that's hardly enough time
to commit a murder

691
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,520
and then scrub the place clean,
is it?

692
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,720
<font color="#ffff00">Two assailants.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe one cleaned up.</font>

693
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,040
Now Ross's car wasn't flagged
until the Sunday.

694
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,120
And we still haven't confirmed
where he was overnight.

695
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,160
<font color="#00ffff">Ma'am? It's the cyber team,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">about those reviews.</font>

696
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,960
<font color="#00ffff">They're all</font>
<font color="#00ffff">from the same IP address.</font>

697
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,880
<font color="#00ffff">So it's likely that they come</font>
<font color="#00ffff">from the same person.</font>

698
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,360
And they can narrow down the
location to around Menton Road, TS5.

699
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,240
<font color="#00ff00">That's Rachel Lim's street.</font>

700
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,880
RACHEL:<font color="#00ffff">He was rude. I got angry.</font>

701
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,040
<font color="#00ffff">So I secretly posted a review.</font>

702
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,560
<font color="#00ffff">Scott saw it, was furious.</font>

703
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,560
<font color="#00ffff">Thought it looked bad.</font>

704
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,360
<font color="#ffff00">So, you wrote more.</font>

705
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,000
Did Pat Helliwell know?

706
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,800
<font color="#00ffff">Pat? No.</font>

707
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,800
<font color="#ffff00">She didn't put you up to it?</font>

708
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,040
<font color="#00ffff">No!</font>

709
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,360
<font color="#00ffff">I burnt my bridges</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with Pat just by leaving.</font>

710
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,480
And what about Scott?

711
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,800
Because if he found out
you'd written these...

712
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,840
SHE EXHALES

713
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,560
..you'd have argued.

714
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,840
Fought even?
<font color="#00ffff">What are you...?</font>

715
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,760
<font color="#00ffff">No! Scott had no idea.</font>

716
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,560
So, it was a secret.
No-one knew?

717
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,680
<font color="#00ffff">Well. I wondered if maybe Ant...</font>

718
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:01,440
<font color="#00ffff">He gave me a funny look when Scott</font>
<font color="#00ffff">was mouthing off about them once.</font>

719
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,000
<font color="#00ffff">But never said anything.</font>

720
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,880
<font color="#00ffff">No. It was just me.</font>

721
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,600
So, you just wanted
to kick Scott where it hurt.

722
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,800
<font color="#ffff00">Well, she admitted</font>
<font color="#ffff00">she wanted to hurt him.</font>

723
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,040
Yeah, but we already know she
picked up her bairn around midnight.

724
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,080
So who was it cleaned up?

725
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:29,120
Ross? Maybe he didn't have
an early night after all.

726
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,680
<font color="#ffff00">Why would he want</font>
<font color="#ffff00">his business partner dead?</font>

727
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,920
<font color="#ffff00">Plus, she was the one</font>
<font color="#ffff00">who discovered him.</font>

728
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,520
Aye, well.
That's a double bluff too far.

729
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,880
Especially as she wasn't even meant
to be in the shop on a Sunday.

730
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,480
<font color="#00ffff">Er, ma'am? I've got something</font>
<font color="#00ffff">on that domestic CCTV.</font>

731
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,800
<font color="#00ffff">We can see who keyed Scott's car.</font>

732
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,720
<font color="#ffff00">Who's that...</font>
That's Tyler Hawton!

733
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,520
Ah, not so keen on Scott after all,
is he?

734
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,120
<font color="#00ffff">Er, and there's more, ma'am.</font>

735
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,920
<font color="#00ffff">Er, I spotted it while trawling</font>
<font color="#00ffff">back through the footage.</font>

736
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,840
<font color="#00ffff">Er, whizzed through some other dates</font>

737
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,240
<font color="#00ffff">and I've got him</font>
<font color="#00ffff">on several occasions.</font>

738
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,360
<font color="#ffff00">A random pedestrian?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Er, no.</font>

739
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,680
<font color="#00ffff">Not when five minutes later...</font>

740
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,400
<font color="#00ffff">He's there</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for much longer this time.</font>

741
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,400
<font color="#00ffff">I've got him on three other days.</font>

742
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,160
That hoodie.
Can you zoom in on that?

743
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,280
<font color="#ffff00">What's that logo.</font>
That's Southwall Football Club.

744
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,560
That's the coach.
That's Ollie Keeble!

745
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,740
VERA: Something was going on at
home, what did you mean by that?

746
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,160
<font color="#00ffff">I was worried about Tyler.</font>

747
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,360
<font color="#00ffff">He hadn't come to training</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for a couple of days.</font>

748
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,120
What were you doing there?

749
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,920
<font color="#00ffff">I said, I was worried about him.</font>

750
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,040
Aye. There's worrying,
but then there's stalking.

751
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,800
<font color="#00ffff">Stalking?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Well, what would you call it?</font>

752
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,160
<font color="#00ffff">It was just... concern.</font>

753
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,320
<font color="#00ffff">I wasn't harassing anyone.</font>

754
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,400
<font color="#00ffff">Someone said I was?</font>

755
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,400
Well, they might, if they saw this.

756
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,000
What did you think was gonna happen?

757
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,480
<font color="#00ffff">Just that Tyler might bring</font>
<font color="#00ffff">his aggression home.</font>

758
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,800
<font color="#ffff00">How was hanging</font>
<font color="#ffff00">about his house gonna help?</font>

759
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,040
<font color="#00ffff">I don't know! I just...</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I wanted to do something.</font>

760
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,520
<font color="#00ffff">Be close.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Seeing as Scott didn't care.</font>

761
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,320
Well, maybe Scott's worrying
was justified.

762
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,600
And you really do have feelings
for Carrie.

763
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,120
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

764
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,600
<font color="#00ffff">I mean...</font>

765
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,560
<font color="#00ffff">I just want what's best for her.</font>

766
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,680
Did you talk to Scott?

767
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,080
<font color="#00ffff">What do you mean? When?</font>

768
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,920
<font color="#ffff00">Last Saturday night</font>
<font color="#ffff00">at the chip shop?</font>

769
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,080
The night he died!

770
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,760
<font color="#00ffff">No. No, Scott was... I'd never...</font>

771
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,240
<font color="#00ffff">Look, I was nowhere near there</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that night! I told you.</font>

772
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,760
<font color="#00ffff">I'd matches during the day</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and drinks in the evening.</font>

773
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,800
Yeah, then you were home alone.

774
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,400
Well, it's clear to me
he has feelings for Carrie.

775
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,640
Did his background check give us
anything?<font color="#ffff00">Nah, no previous.</font>

776
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,840
<font color="#ffff00">He was a landscape gardener</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for years,</font>

777
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,120
<font color="#ffff00">but his passion lies</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in football coaching.</font>

778
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,480
<font color="#ffff00">His alibi checks out till</font>
<font color="#ffff00">he left the pub just after 11.</font>

779
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,360
But no-one to corroborate
after that.

780
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,840
OK. Well, we're gonna
have to let him go.

781
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,280
<font color="#ffff00">We should speak to Tyler</font>
<font color="#ffff00">about keying Scott's car.</font>

782
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,920
Ah, well, now's a good a time...

783
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,360
<font color="#00ff00">Ma'am? The chip shop accounts.</font>

784
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,880
<font color="#00ffff">Er, we've been working together</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to see how they fit</font>

785
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,800
<font color="#00ffff">with the deceased's finances.</font>

786
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,560
<font color="#00ff00">It's true that Scott was paying</font>
<font color="#00ff00">staff under the legal minimum.</font>

787
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,480
<font color="#ffff00">Well, we should speak to HMRC</font>
<font color="#ffff00">about that.</font> <font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

788
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,360
<font color="#00ffff">And while he was squeezing them,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">he was increasing his own salary.</font>

789
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,480
What? Well, he was probably
paying his debts?

790
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,760
<font color="#00ffff">Er, well,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a big chunk of it went there, yeah.</font>

791
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,480
<font color="#00ffff">But there's something else.</font>

792
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,520
<font color="#00ffff">Regular payments coming</font>
<font color="#00ffff">into Scott from another source.</font>

793
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,560
<font color="#00ffff">He put's that money</font>
<font color="#00ffff">into a separate savings pot.</font>

794
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,760
<font color="#00ffff">And then uses it for things</font>
<font color="#00ffff">like servicing his car,</font>

795
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,440
<font color="#00ffff">buying clothes, flowers for Sophie.</font>

796
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,680
What is the source of that money?

797
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,120
<font color="#00ff00">Another account under Scott's name,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">with a different bank.</font>

798
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,320
<font color="#ffff00">He was hiding his tracks</font>
<font color="#ffff00">about something.</font>

799
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,680
<font color="#00ff00">So, it seems. Er, we've requested</font>
<font color="#00ff00">access to the second account,</font>

800
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,440
<font color="#00ff00">so we can trace</font>
<font color="#00ff00">where the money originates.</font>

801
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,040
Well done, you two.

802
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,840
Keep at it and let us know, hmm.
<font color="#00ffff">Ma'am.</font>

803
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,000
We know it was you keyed his motor.

804
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,960
Can show you the footage
if you like.

805
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,680
<font color="#ffff00">You also slashed his tyre. Right?</font>

806
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,520
<font color="#00ffff">But... Scott was...</font>

807
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,680
<font color="#00ffff">He was good to you. Wasn't he?</font>

808
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,440
<font color="#00ff00">You can stop defending him now, Mum.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Defending?</font>

809
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,080
<font color="#00ff00">He was cheating, remember?</font>

810
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,720
Oh, is that why you did it?

811
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,640
<font color="#00ff00">No. I didn't know. I told you.</font>

812
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,960
Why, then?

813
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,600
<font color="#00ff00">I overheard him talking about me.</font>

814
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,920
<font color="#00ffff">What? No. To me?</font>

815
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,600
Saying what?

816
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,200
<font color="#00ff00">That she was a bad mum.</font>

817
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,280
<font color="#00ff00">Cos she were never there,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">always working.</font>

818
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,960
<font color="#00ff00">And that he was getting fed up</font>
<font color="#00ff00">of playing stepdad</font>

819
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,200
<font color="#00ff00">to a needy, whiny child.</font>

820
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,200
<font color="#ffff00">He said that?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">He was upset.</font>

821
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,760
<font color="#00ff00">I said don't defend him!</font>

822
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,160
<font color="#00ffff">I'm not! Because it's true!</font>

823
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,800
<font color="#00ffff">I haven't been around, have I?</font>

824
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,040
So, is there anything else
we should know?

825
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,440
Right.
<font color="#00ff00">I didn't know he was cheating.</font>

826
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,960
<font color="#00ff00">But I did see him arguing</font>
<font color="#00ff00">with someone.</font>

827
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,840
<font color="#ffff00">When was this?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Saturday evening.</font>

828
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,040
<font color="#00ff00">Thought it was mum at first,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">but it wasn't.</font>

829
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,080
<font color="#00ff00">Whoever it was,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">she was really yelling at him.</font>

830
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,320
And where was this?

831
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,840
<font color="#00ff00">In town. Not far from the chippie.</font>

832
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,320
<font color="#ffff00">This woman that Tyler saw Scott</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with...</font>

833
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,960
<font color="#ffff00">You think it could be Sophie Jenson?</font>

834
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,520
What, his bit on the side?

835
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,560
Nah, Tyler said he thought
it was his mam at first.

836
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,400
But Sophie's blonde,
fancy clothes, nothing like her.

837
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,600
Plus, she said she'd never been
to the chippie and

838
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,840
I'm inclined to believe her.

839
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,680
<font color="#ffff00">So, who was it, then?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Another lover?</font>

840
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,520
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know</font>
<font color="#ffff00">where he finds the time.</font>

841
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:12,320
Kenny. We need to trawl through that
street CCTV again, near the chippie.

842
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,280
Saturday, post 5:30.

843
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,840
We're looking for Scott arguing
with a woman.<font color="#00ffff">Ah, right, ma'am.</font>

844
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,600
<font color="#00ffff">Got a couple of things</font>
<font color="#00ffff">on Ross Simmons, ma'am.</font>

845
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,760
<font color="#00ffff">He emailed Scott a few weeks back.</font>

846
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,080
<font color="#00ffff">Suggesting that they dissolve</font>
<font color="#00ffff">their partnership.</font>

847
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,280
<font color="#ffff00">Ross said they had</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a good working relationship.</font>

848
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,480
<font color="#ffff00">Did Scott reply?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah. It was pretty curt.</font>

849
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,800
<font color="#00ffff">They agreed to, er,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">dissolving their partnership.</font>

850
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,640
<font color="#00ffff">But it meant that Ross would</font>
<font color="#00ffff">have to walk away from the shop.</font>

851
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,280
What, give him the family business?

852
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,320
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah. Oh, and the other thing.</font>

853
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,800
<font color="#00ffff">Er, Ross's trip down south</font>
<font color="#00ffff">on Sunday.</font>

854
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,880
Yeah, what?

855
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,080
<font color="#00ffff">Well, the contact</font>
<font color="#00ffff">confirms the meeting.</font>

856
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,840
<font color="#00ffff">But he thought that Ross was going</font>
<font color="#00ffff">on to another meeting in London.</font>

857
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,160
<font color="#00ffff">But he didn't know who it was.</font>

858
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,320
<font color="#ffff00">He didn't mention that, did he?</font>

859
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,960
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>
So, we're back to Ross.

860
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,760
We're gonna need another chat.

861
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,680
MARK:<font color="#00ffff">'Ma'am, I've spoken with</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Scott's insolvency practitioner,</font>

862
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,880
<font color="#00ffff">'and he was the owner</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of a catering company.</font>

863
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,560
<font color="#00ffff">'But his mismanagement</font>
<font color="#00ffff">led to it going bust.</font>

864
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,320
<font color="#00ffff">'Left Scott on the hook</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with a load of debt.'</font>

865
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,480
And where's this company located?

866
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,760
<font color="#00ffff">'Er, South London.'</font>

867
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,120
<font color="#00ffff">'Croydon.'</font>
Croydon?

868
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,320
That's where Ross Simmonds was
pulled over by the police, isn't it?

869
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,560
<font color="#00ffff">'Yes, ma'am.'</font>
Right. Thanks, Mark.

870
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,480
<font color="#00ffff">Ma'am.</font>

871
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,280
<font color="#ffff00">So, Ross was digging</font>
<font color="#ffff00">into Scott's past?</font>

872
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,960
MOBILE RINGS
Aye, it sounds like it.

873
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,520
<font color="#ffff00">Joe Ashworth.</font>

874
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,280
<font color="#ffff00">OK, and is... is that...?</font>

875
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,240
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. No, er, I understand.</font>

876
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,960
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you for letting me know.</font>

877
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,960
That your dad?
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. Er...</font>

878
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,840
<font color="#ffff00">The hospice.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">He's lost consciousness.</font>

879
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,680
Do you wanna go there?

880
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,280
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>
Right.

881
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,000
SHE TUTS

882
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,280
<font color="#ffff00">Where you going?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I thought we were going to see Ross?</font>

883
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,880
Well, he can wait.

884
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,720
Why don't you go and see your dad.

885
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,440
<font color="#ffff00">He won't even know I'm there.</font>

886
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,400
Fine. Say he doesn't know.

887
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,800
But you will.

888
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,560
<font color="#ffff00">There's the dementia.</font>

889
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,960
<font color="#ffff00">Besides to the fact</font>
<font color="#ffff00">he's drugged to the eyeballs</font>

890
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,440
<font color="#ffff00">for this infection he's got.</font>

891
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,240
<font color="#ffff00">None of this was unexpected.</font>

892
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,640
Look, all I'm saying,
is that when it was my dad...

893
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,560
..I was glad I took the chance.

894
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,600
<font color="#ffff00">I came home... because I thought</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it might bring us closer...</font>

895
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,360
<font color="#ffff00">But the dementia</font>
<font color="#ffff00">had taken him away by then.</font>

896
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,240
<font color="#ffff00">And I worry about me and my lad</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and...</font>

897
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,400
<font color="#ffff00">It's easier with the girls.</font>

898
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,760
<font color="#ffff00">They have their spats.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">But they're close.</font>

899
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,600
<font color="#ffff00">They are sisters together.</font>

900
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,280
You and your lad'll be fine.

901
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:16,640
But you'll never forgive yourself if
you don't say goodbye to your dad.

902
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:24,000
<font color="#ffff00">Honestly...</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I think I'm more use here.</font>

903
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,200
<font color="#ffff00">Let's go and see Ross, eh.</font>

904
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,120
OK, come on.

905
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,360
Sermon over.

906
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,920
ROSS:<font color="#00ffff">Look, I am really sorry...</font>

907
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,360
<font color="#00ffff">Sorry.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Come on...</font>

908
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,440
<font color="#00ff00">What do you mean?</font>
Mr Daleson? What's happened?

909
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,680
<font color="#00ff00">It's Ross.</font>

910
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,840
<font color="#00ff00">He's saying we won't open again.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">What? Never?</font> <font color="#00ff00">Never!</font>

911
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,000
Well, maybe you can help us.

912
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,840
<font color="#00ff00">What about?</font>

913
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,720
Did you know, it was Rachel
who posted those rotten reviews

914
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,800
about the chip shop?
<font color="#00ff00">I guessed.</font>

915
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,000
<font color="#00ff00">Saw how she looked when Scott</font>
<font color="#00ff00">was shouting about 'em.</font>

916
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,760
<font color="#ffff00">But he didn't know?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Scott? No.</font>

917
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,280
<font color="#00ff00">Rachel would have been out the door</font>
<font color="#00ff00">if he had.</font>

918
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,440
<font color="#00ff00">How are Carrie? And Tyler?</font>

919
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,240
Well, they're in shock.

920
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,760
So, you know them, then?

921
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,200
<font color="#00ff00">Sort of.</font>

922
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,680
<font color="#00ff00">I don't think Scott</font>
<font color="#00ff00">was kind to them, either.</font>

923
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,960
<font color="#00ff00">Carrie was in the shop once</font>
<font color="#00ff00">when I took Finn to hospital.</font>

924
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,920
<font color="#00ff00">Even offered us a lift.</font>

925
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,160
<font color="#00ff00">Scott was tutting about me going</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and Carrie told him to give over.</font>

926
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,360
<font color="#00ff00">Was lovely about it.</font>

927
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,680
How is your brother?

928
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,080
<font color="#00ff00">Oh. Er, discharged</font>
<font color="#00ff00">from hospital today, hopefully.</font>

929
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,440
Right, you go be with your family,
love.<font color="#00ff00">Thanks.</font>

930
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,040
Not open today?

931
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,360
<font color="#00ffff">Can't see us coming back</font>
<font color="#00ffff">from a murder on the premises.</font>

932
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,760
Now, you told us you had a good
working relationship with Scott,

933
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,200
didn't yer?
<font color="#00ffff">Well. Yeah. Mostly.</font>

934
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,280
<font color="#ffff00">But you wanted to dissolve the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">partnership. We've seen your email.</font>

935
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:28,480
<font color="#ffff00">And you met someone else in London,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">last Sunday.</font>

936
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,960
Now, what was that meeting about?

937
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,520
<font color="#00ffff">I met with his old partner.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">In South London.</font>

938
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,720
<font color="#00ffff">Told us how badly</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Scott mismanaged their business.</font>

939
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,560
Now why keep that meeting a secret?

940
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,080
<font color="#00ffff">Because it showed how stupid I was!</font>

941
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,720
<font color="#00ffff">I should've checked out Scott</font>
<font color="#00ffff">at the start.</font>

942
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,240
<font color="#00ffff">But he swaggered round</font>
<font color="#00ffff">like some big success.</font>

943
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,840
<font color="#00ffff">Told us his previous business issues</font>
<font color="#00ffff">weren't his fault.</font>

944
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,480
<font color="#00ffff">I was a mug.</font>

945
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,320
<font color="#00ffff">Got into a partnership. Got trapped.</font>

946
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,480
<font color="#00ffff">Lost everything my parents built.</font>

947
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,600
<font color="#ffff00">You buy that?</font>
Ah.

948
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,240
I mean, would he really investigate
his partner's business dealings

949
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,080
in London, after he's killed him?

950
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,040
Maybe we need
someone else's insight.

951
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,440
<font color="#ffff00">Pat Helliwell?</font>

952
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:47,280
Aye, she's known
the family for years. Come on.

953
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,080
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, aye. What now?</font>
Erm...

954
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:00,680
We just wanted to ask you
about Ross Simmons, love.

955
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,200
<font color="#00ffff">Ross? What about him?</font>

956
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,760
Well, how do you feel about
him coming back to take over

957
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,680
the family's business?
<font color="#00ffff">I were pleased.</font>

958
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:12,200
<font color="#ffff00">Would you not have preferred</font>
<font color="#ffff00">your rival shop to just disappear?</font>

959
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,400
<font color="#00ffff">Well, there's always been room</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for two of us before.</font>

960
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,600
<font color="#00ffff">That's why I was</font>
<font color="#00ffff">so disgusted by Scott.</font>

961
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,640
Mmm.

962
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,080
Do you think he was involved

963
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,520
in those dirty tricks
you told us about?

964
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,960
<font color="#00ffff">Well, not unless the apple fell</font>
<font color="#00ffff">very far from the tree.</font>

965
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,800
<font color="#00ffff">No, his folks,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">they were good people.</font>

966
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,000
<font color="#00ffff">And I knew Ross from a bairn,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">you know.</font>

967
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,880
<font color="#00ffff">I weren't too sure about him trying</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to reinvent their shop, though.</font>

968
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,880
<font color="#00ffff">Would yer?</font>

969
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,680
Oh.

970
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:44,200
Not a fan of gentrification, then?
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

971
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,880
<font color="#ffff00">Rachel Lim, she worked for you?</font>

972
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,040
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, till Scott pinched her.</font>

973
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,600
<font color="#ffff00">Any concern about her honesty?</font>

974
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,200
<font color="#00ffff">Rachel? No. Good worker.</font>

975
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,760
<font color="#00ffff">Bad judgement,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">trusting Scott Rhodes, though.</font>

976
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,320
<font color="#ffff00">Did she ask for her old job back?</font>

977
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:01,200
<font color="#00ffff">Well, I'd already filled</font>
<font color="#00ffff">t'position, you know.</font>

978
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,040
SHE GROANS

979
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:08,000
So, are these the bins you say
Scott was overfilling?

980
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:11,240
<font color="#00ffff">A bit late to go after him</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for it now, in't it.</font>

981
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,760
This your lock-up?
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

982
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,040
I see there's no padlock.
Is it always open?

983
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,840
<font color="#00ffff">Well, there's nothing valuable</font>
<font color="#00ffff">inside.</font>

984
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,400
And did Scott ever dump stuff
in here,

985
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,120
as well as the bins?
<font color="#00ffff">Well, how the hell do I know?</font>

986
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,160
<font color="#00ffff">I mean, I don't go in there</font>
<font color="#00ffff">every five minutes.</font>

987
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,840
Joe.

988
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,800
SHE SIGHS
<font color="#00ffff">Look. What is going on?</font>

989
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,120
What is all this stuff?

990
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,920
<font color="#00ffff">It's rubbish. It's from my refit.</font>

991
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,480
Ah, was a month ago, wasn't it?

992
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,200
SHE SIGHS
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

993
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,840
<font color="#00ffff">Look, I need to arrange</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a collection.</font>

994
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,240
<font color="#00ffff">I just thought that the scrappers</font>

995
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,200
<font color="#00ffff">might want to scavenge</font>
<font color="#00ffff">some of the metal first.</font>

996
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,200
Mmm. Anyone else use this lock-up?

997
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,720
SHE SIGHS
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

998
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,320
<font color="#ffff00">Boss?</font>

999
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,680
<font color="#ffff00">Is this yours?</font>

1000
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,120
We also found a dented chip pan
in your lock-up.

1001
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,440
Now, we're awaiting
forensic confirmation.

1002
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,320
But we believe both these weapons
were used to kill Scott Rhodes.

1003
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,400
<font color="#00ffff">And you're saying,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">you think I put 'em there?</font>

1004
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,120
<font color="#00ffff">That I had something to do</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with his death?</font> Well, didn't you?

1005
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,080
<font color="#ffff00">You said you were disgusted</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with Scott.</font>

1006
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,200
<font color="#00ffff">Right,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">does anything link them to me?</font>

1007
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,680
<font color="#ffff00">Besides where they were found?</font>

1008
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,080
<font color="#00ffff">Look, do you really think</font>
<font color="#00ffff">if I had hurt him, if I had,</font>

1009
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,480
<font color="#00ffff">then that I would leave</font>

1010
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,280
<font color="#00ffff">the smoking gun right</font>
<font color="#00ffff">outside my own shop?</font>

1011
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:53,040
OK. Then, who else do you think
might've put them there?

1012
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,640
<font color="#00ffff">Could be anyone!</font>

1013
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,080
<font color="#00ffff">I mean, you saw yourselves,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that area is not exactly secure.</font>

1014
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,040
<font color="#00ffff">That's how Scott</font>
<font color="#00ffff">managed to use me bins.</font>

1015
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,320
<font color="#ffff00">He was hardly hiding</font>
<font color="#ffff00">his own murder weapons, was he?</font>

1016
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,560
Anything on them?
<font color="#00ffff">Both were cleaned thoroughly.</font>

1017
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,560
<font color="#00ffff">But we found residual traces</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of blood in the knife blade housing,</font>

1018
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,160
<font color="#00ffff">inside the handle.</font>
Enough for a decent sample?

1019
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,320
<font color="#00ffff">Enough to confirm a match</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with our deceased. Or not.</font>

1020
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,280
<font color="#00ffff">I'll let you know when we do.</font>

1021
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,240
<font color="#00ffff">But if you're hoping for additional</font>
<font color="#00ffff">DNA, to point to a perpetrator...</font>

1022
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,840
What? Nothing at all?

1023
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,960
<font color="#00ffff">We might need something trickier</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to scrub clean.</font>

1024
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,280
<font color="#00ff00">Ma'am. I'm struggling here</font>
<font color="#00ff00">trying to find Scott having</font>

1025
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,480
<font color="#00ff00">this argument</font>
<font color="#00ff00">with a mystery woman on Saturday.</font>

1026
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,160
What, there's nothing?

1027
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,920
<font color="#00ff00">Well, the CCTV coverage isn't great.</font>

1028
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,280
Ah. So we still don't know
who this woman is?<font color="#00ff00">No.</font>

1029
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,560
<font color="#00ffff">I've got something,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">on Scott's accounts, ma'am.</font>

1030
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,640
<font color="#00ffff">Those payments to him?</font>

1031
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,760
<font color="#ffff00">So? Where was the cash coming from?</font>

1032
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,800
<font color="#00ffff">He was passing it</font>
<font color="#00ffff">through the other bank account.</font>

1033
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,720
<font color="#00ffff">But originally it came</font>
<font color="#00ffff">from a personal account</font>

1034
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,680
<font color="#00ffff">in the name of Heidi Stokes.</font>

1035
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,720
So, who's she?

1036
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,320
What's her connection to Scott?

1037
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,640
<font color="#00ffff">Well, her main connection</font>
<font color="#00ffff">isn't with Scott, ma'am.</font>

1038
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:04,440
<font color="#00ffff">It's with Carrie. Heidi Stokes</font>
<font color="#00ffff">is Carrie's grandmother.</font>

1039
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,360
And when did a grandmother
come out of the woodwork?

1040
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,840
<font color="#00ffff">I had to dig a bit.</font>

1041
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,920
<font color="#00ffff">Er, so Carrie's parents died</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in a car crash, years back.</font>

1042
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,840
<font color="#00ffff">And we knew she had a sister</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in Bristol.</font>

1043
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,080
<font color="#00ffff">But what we didn't know,</font>

1044
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,720
<font color="#00ffff">is that Heidi is</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Carrie's paternal grandmother.</font>

1045
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,320
<font color="#ffff00">She implied she never saw family.</font>

1046
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,200
Yeah, never mind
what Carrie implied.

1047
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,240
I'm more worried
about what Scott said.

1048
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,080
<font color="#ffff00">Scott?</font>
Yeah. To Sophie Jenson.

1049
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,240
That lass he got up the duff.

1050
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,960
She rattled off a list of people
Scott said he cared about.

1051
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,400
And said he visited an old woman.

1052
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,560
<font color="#ffff00">And you think that was...?</font>

1053
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:46,040
We need an immediate welfare
check on this Heidi Stokes.

1054
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,240
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not waiting till we hear</font>
<font color="#ffff00">what uniform finds.</font>

1055
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,640
<font color="#ffff00">Steph, pass us that address.</font>

1056
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,760
Hey, Joe! Joe! I'll drive.

1057
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,440
We should speak
to the first responders.

1058
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:09,200
And we'll need the neighbours
talked to, as well. Joe!

1059
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,040
Joe, wait.

1060
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,280
<font color="#00ffff">We had to force entry, ma'am.</font>

1061
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,520
<font color="#00ffff">It's not looking good.</font>

1062
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,080
PARAMEDIC:<font color="#00ff00">Nice and gentle.</font>

1063
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,760
<font color="#ffff00">So, Scott was visiting her</font>
<font color="#ffff00">because he cared, was he?</font>

1064
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,400
Uniform had to force entry.

1065
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,640
Paramedics said
she was barely conscious.

1066
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,800
Confused.

1067
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,320
Dehydrated.

1068
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:02,400
They're getting some fluids
into her, now.

1069
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:05,720
So she's covered in bed sores.

1070
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,560
Likely from months of lying in here.

1071
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,080
Do you need a minute?

1072
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,840
<font color="#ffff00">Scott was taking her money,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">wasn't he?</font>

1073
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:25,680
<font color="#ffff00">He got Heidi Stokes' details</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and arranged the transfers</font>

1074
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,520
<font color="#ffff00">from her bank account into his.</font>

1075
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,960
<font color="#ffff00">All the while leaving her</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in this state.</font>

1076
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,240
<font color="#ffff00">And who else knew? Carrie?</font>
Well, we'll find out.

1077
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,400
<font color="#ffff00">How could she not have?</font>

1078
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,920
Aye, you're right.

1079
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,160
Come on. Let's bring her in.

1080
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,480
<font color="#00ffff">Arresting me on suspicion of what?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Elder abuse.</font>

1081
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,680
Come on, love.
We'll talk about it at the station.

1082
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,400
Take care of the lad.
<font color="#00ff00">Yes, ma'am.</font>

1083
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,080
Come on, keep going.

1084
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:55,280
<font color="#00ff00">Mum? What's going on?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I don't know.</font>

1085
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,040
Now, come on. Come on.
<font color="#00ff00">Leave her alone!</font>

1086
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,600
DOG BARKS
Station. Right now.

1087
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,240
<font color="#00ff00">Wait. You can't just take her!</font>

1088
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,120
<font color="#00ff00">No! You can't take her!</font>

1089
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,760
<font color="#ffff00">Step back! Now!</font>

1090
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,160
<font color="#00ff00">Get off me!</font>
DI Ashworth!

1091
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,680
What do you think you're doing?
<font color="#00ff00">Leave me alone!</font>

1092
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,960
<font color="#00ff00">Mum!</font>
BARKING CONTINUES

1093
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,800
<font color="#00ff00">Get off.</font>

1094
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,800
<font color="#ffff00">Calm down. You need to calm down.</font>

1095
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,680
<font color="#00ff00">Just tell me what's happening.</font>

1096
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,000
<font color="#ffff00">Just gonna ask your mam</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a few questions. OK?</font>

1097
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,440
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry. That was unprofessional.</font>

1098
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:34,840
Well, I should hate to step
out of line round your house.

1099
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,240
<font color="#ffff00">It was just seeing that woman,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in that helpless state.</font>

1100
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,000
<font color="#ffff00">And knowing what me dad's</font>
<font color="#ffff00">been through</font>

1101
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,680
<font color="#ffff00">You know, if someone had...</font>

1102
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,440
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe you were right,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">about me working.</font>

1103
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,480
Well, maybe you should step aside,
Joe. We can manage.

1104
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,040
<font color="#ffff00">All right, if you'll excuse me,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">ma'am.</font>

1105
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,680
KNOCKING
<font color="#ffff00">Ma'am. Carrie's being processed.</font>

1106
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,920
<font color="#ffff00">She's ready to be interviewed.</font>
Ah, right.

1107
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,920
OK. Is there anything else
I need to know?

1108
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,520
<font color="#00ffff">Er, uniform spoke</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to one of the gran's neighbours,</font>

1109
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,000
<font color="#00ffff">who identified Scott's photo.</font>

1110
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,680
<font color="#00ffff">Confirmed that he went in and out.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Always seemed pleasant.</font>

1111
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:31,520
<font color="#00ffff">And also, she said there was a woman</font>
<font color="#00ffff">hanging about on Saturday</font>

1112
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,920
<font color="#00ffff">and she rung</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Heidi's doorbell several times.</font>

1113
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,200
Did you get a description?

1114
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,080
<font color="#00ffff">Mid-30s. Brunette, ma'am.</font>

1115
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,720
<font color="#00ff00">Could that be Carrie?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Er, we could check.</font>

1116
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,600
<font color="#ffff00">Do a virtual line-up</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with the neighbour?</font>

1117
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,160
That's a good idea.

1118
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,360
And did this brunette
enter the house?

1119
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,200
<font color="#00ffff">Er, the neighbour says not.</font>

1120
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,160
So if it was Carrie,
she couldn't get in?

1121
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,480
<font color="#ffff00">Er, maybe Scott controlled access?</font>

1122
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,000
<font color="#00ffff">Er, one more thing, ma'am.</font>

1123
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:59,560
<font color="#00ffff">The neighbour said that Scott</font>
<font color="#00ffff">himself showed up at midday.</font>

1124
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,400
<font color="#00ffff">And the woman was still there.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">And they argued.</font>

1125
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:08,240
Maybe Carrie hadn't known
what Scott was up to,

1126
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,160
and found out somehow?

1127
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,640
<font color="#ffff00">Would give her a motive to hurt him.</font>

1128
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,520
Well, let's see what she says.

1129
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:18,200
Now DI Ashworth has been called away
on a personal matter.

1130
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,800
Steph. Do you want to join?

1131
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,680
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah. Yeah. Of course.</font>

1132
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:29,240
We don't have any photos
of your gran herself as yet.

1133
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,960
But perhaps you can imagine
an emaciated, vulnerable old woman.

1134
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,320
The state she was in.

1135
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,960
And we have evidence he was helping
her set up internet banking.

1136
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,480
DC Duncan.

1137
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,000
<font color="#00ff00">Relevant paperwork</font>
<font color="#00ff00">collected from her house.</font>

1138
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:47,400
<font color="#00ff00">Scott visited the bank's website</font>
<font color="#00ff00">from his work laptop.</font>

1139
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,800
He was syphoning off her cash, love.

1140
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,600
Set up regular payments to himself.

1141
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,880
Used it to buy fancy clothes!

1142
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,760
<font color="#00ffff">I didn't know he was doing that.</font>

1143
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,320
Ah, but you knew
he was visiting your gran?

1144
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,600
<font color="#00ff00">Why weren't you doing that?</font>

1145
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,520
<font color="#00ff00">You never even mentioned</font>
<font color="#00ff00">you had a gran.</font>

1146
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,120
<font color="#00ffff">Cos I haven't seen her in years.</font>

1147
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,480
<font color="#00ffff">When I got pregnant,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Gran disapproved.</font>

1148
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,600
<font color="#00ffff">Even after Mam and Dad died</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and I was on my own.</font>

1149
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,480
<font color="#00ffff">My sister'd run off.</font>

1150
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,640
<font color="#00ffff">Scared to end up like me.</font>

1151
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,360
<font color="#00ffff">I was left working crappy jobs.</font>

1152
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,280
<font color="#00ffff">No support. No money for childcare.</font>

1153
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,920
<font color="#00ffff">And Gran still didn't wanna know.</font>

1154
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:31,040
It must have been you
who put her and Scott in touch.

1155
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:35,000
<font color="#00ffff">She had a stroke earlier this year.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Minor one.</font>

1156
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,720
<font color="#00ffff">The hospital called me.</font>

1157
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:41,040
And they told her she was gonna
need home care, hmm?<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

1158
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,240
<font color="#00ffff">My sister hadn't been around</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for years.</font>

1159
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,720
<font color="#00ffff">Scott saw I was torn.</font>

1160
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,880
<font color="#00ffff">Said he could help.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Check in on her.</font>

1161
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,280
<font color="#00ffff">Sort a cleaner. Meals on wheels.</font>

1162
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,280
<font color="#00ffff">I started to think</font>
<font color="#00ffff">maybe I could visit her...</font>

1163
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,800
Oh, so why didn't you, love?

1164
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,080
<font color="#00ffff">Scott said</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Gran didn't want me there.</font>

1165
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,840
<font color="#00ffff">Was still bad-mouthing me,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">even when she was weak.</font>

1166
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,400
Scott's been dead five days, love.

1167
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,800
Did you not think
to check in on her?

1168
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:10,200
<font color="#00ffff">I've been trying to get my head</font>
<font color="#00ffff">straight. Be there for Tyler.</font>

1169
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,640
<font color="#00ffff">Besides, he told me</font>
<font color="#00ffff">all the support was set up.</font>

1170
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,600
<font color="#00ffff">If I had known</font>
<font color="#00ffff">he was taking her money...!</font>

1171
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:18,040
You'd have what, love?

1172
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,040
Did you think he was nicking
your inheritance, is that it?

1173
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,440
<font color="#00ffff">What?</font>
Hmm.<font color="#00ffff">No!</font>

1174
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,160
Did that make you angry?

1175
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,920
<font color="#00ffff">Look, I didn't know he was in debt!</font>

1176
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,600
<font color="#00ffff">I didn't know he was cheating!</font>

1177
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,000
<font color="#00ffff">He took me for an idiot!</font>

1178
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:33,680
We have a witness can place
a dark-haired mid-30s woman

1179
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,960
at Heidi's house on Saturday.

1180
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,720
<font color="#00ffff">Well, it wasn't me.</font>

1181
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,320
<font color="#00ffff">I haven't been there</font>
<font color="#00ffff">since my parents died.</font>

1182
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,080
<font color="#00ffff">So, do we keep hold of her?</font>
What?

1183
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,440
Well, of course we do!

1184
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,280
<font color="#00ffff">Maybe someone else found out</font>

1185
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,360
<font color="#00ffff">that Scott was mistreating Heidi</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and helped Carrie to punish him.</font>

1186
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:55,160
Well, Paula did say there were
possibly two assailants.

1187
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,720
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, well, Ollie Keeble? Tyler?</font>

1188
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,080
<font color="#00ffff">Ollie AND Tyler?</font>

1189
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,520
Look, I want
everyone's alibis going over.

1190
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,320
<font color="#00ffff">We can access Carrie's phone, too.</font>

1191
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:08,280
Kenny, did Mark set up that virtual
ID yet, with Heidi's neighbour?

1192
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,680
<font color="#00ff00">Mark's gone down himself, ma'am.</font>

1193
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,040
<font color="#00ff00">Er, the hospital rang, ma'am.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Heidi's awake.</font>

1194
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:16,960
Well, maybe she can tell us herself,
if Carrie was there.

1195
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,520
Ah, no.
This is best one-to-one, Steph.

1196
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,280
You get on with Carrie's phone.

1197
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:29,000
HEIDI:
<font color="#ffff00">That's Scott. He visits. Helps me.</font>

1198
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,800
<font color="#ffff00">I haven't seen him for a few days.</font>

1199
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,880
<font color="#ffff00">Haven't I?</font>
Oh, no, you won't have done, love.

1200
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,200
So, how'd you meet him?

1201
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:45,240
<font color="#ffff00">Scott? Oh. My granddaughter.</font>

1202
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,480
<font color="#ffff00">Last time I was here.</font>

1203
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,920
<font color="#ffff00">In hospital. A stroke.</font>

1204
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,160
And he helps you, does he?

1205
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,280
<font color="#ffff00">I was suspicious at first.</font>

1206
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,560
<font color="#ffff00">But he was so polite.</font>

1207
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:03,360
<font color="#ffff00">And helped me organise</font>
<font color="#ffff00">all kinds of things.</font>

1208
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,240
And did Carrie never visit?

1209
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,280
<font color="#ffff00">Carrie?</font>

1210
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,920
Aye, your granddaughter.

1211
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,600
<font color="#ffff00">Aye. Little Carrie.</font>

1212
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,320
<font color="#ffff00">I really wanted to see her.</font>

1213
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:20,040
<font color="#ffff00">Scott told me she wouldn't come.</font>

1214
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,480
<font color="#ffff00">You're with the police?</font>
Aye. That's right, love.

1215
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,640
<font color="#ffff00">And where's Scott?</font>

1216
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,960
<font color="#ffff00">Has something happened?</font>

1217
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,680
Now, I just want to know
if Carrie came to visit you, pet.

1218
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,400
<font color="#ffff00">Carrie?</font>
Aye.

1219
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:39,040
Your granddaughter.
<font color="#ffff00">Granddaughter.</font>

1220
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,160
<font color="#ffff00">Oh. I saw her.</font>

1221
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,320
And when was that, love?

1222
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,800
<font color="#ffff00">When?</font>
Mmm.

1223
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,480
<font color="#ffff00">Must've been... I...</font>

1224
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,360
<font color="#ffff00">I saw her through the window.</font>

1225
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,200
Paula. You've found something?

1226
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:06,200
<font color="#ffff00">We've found some cleaning cloths</font>
<font color="#ffff00">among the general waste</font>

1227
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,560
<font color="#ffff00">with blood on them.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Results aren't back,</font>

1228
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,920
<font color="#ffff00">but hopefully we can confirm</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the blood on the clothes</font>

1229
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,560
<font color="#ffff00">and the knife is Scott Rhodes.</font>

1230
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,040
Oh, tell me there's something else?
Other DNA?

1231
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,160
<font color="#ffff00">It's possible.</font>

1232
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,000
<font color="#ffff00">Er, if we find any,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I'll obviously try and match it.</font>

1233
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:20,080
<font color="#00ffff">How was Heidi, ma'am?</font>

1234
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:23,360
Well, she suggested Carrie
had been outside the house.

1235
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,880
But I doubt her testimony
would stand up in court.

1236
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,520
Mark! Did you see Heidi's neighbour?
<font color="#00ff00">Er, yeah.</font>

1237
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:31,520
<font color="#00ff00">She didn't pick Carrie's photo,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">ma'am.</font>

1238
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:33,080
<font color="#00ff00">Said that she couldn't be sure.</font>

1239
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,960
<font color="#00ff00">But seeing as you needed</font>
<font color="#00ff00">alibis double checking,</font>

1240
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,200
<font color="#00ff00">I called in on the warehouse</font>
<font color="#00ff00">that Carrie works at</font>

1241
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,760
<font color="#00ff00">and spoke to the manager.</font>

1242
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:42,160
<font color="#00ff00">Now they confirmed</font>
<font color="#00ff00">that she started her shift on time,</font>

1243
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:45,040
<font color="#00ff00">but that she left early</font>
<font color="#00ff00">because of a family matter.</font>

1244
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:48,200
Did she? How early?

1245
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,440
<font color="#00ff00">Missed the last few hours.</font>

1246
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,440
<font color="#00ff00">So, 12:30, maybe?</font>

1247
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,320
<font color="#00ff00">Erm, said she was picked up</font>
<font color="#00ff00">in a car by someone.</font>

1248
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,360
<font color="#00ff00">Manager reckoned it was a woman.</font>

1249
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,960
<font color="#00ff00">I've requested the car park CCTV.</font>

1250
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,040
Hang on, Tyler told us he saw
a woman arguing with Scott.

1251
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,320
And he thought it was his mam,
at first.

1252
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:12,240
Now could that be the woman
outside Heidi's house?

1253
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:18,360
She's just told me that she saw her
granddaughter through the window.

1254
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,680
But Carrie has a sister,
doesn't she?

1255
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,040
<font color="#00ffff">Crystal Hawton.</font>

1256
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,640
And now you're telling me
a woman picks her up from work

1257
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,480
in the middle of the night.

1258
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,120
We need to find this sister.

1259
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,720
And my guess is she's not
in Bristol. Get onto it.

1260
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,440
<font color="#00ff00">Ma'am.</font>

1261
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,640
Are you still here?

1262
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,160
<font color="#00ffff">Nice.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Er, that was the hospital, ma'am.</font>

1263
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,120
<font color="#ffff00">Heidi's got a visitor.</font>

1264
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,320
<font color="#ffff00">And we know it's not Carrie.</font>

1265
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,040
<font color="#ffff00">Cos she's banged up here!</font>

1266
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,440
<font color="#00ff00">'Transactions confirm Sunderland.'</font>
<font color="#ffff00">OK.</font>

1267
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,600
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, thanks, Mark.</font>
What?

1268
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,720
<font color="#ffff00">Crystal Hawton's bank card's</font>
<font color="#ffff00">been used in Sunderland.</font>

1269
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:59,760
<font color="#ffff00">Now we think she's travelled</font>
<font color="#ffff00">from Bristol last Friday.</font>

1270
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,560
Yeah, day before Scott was killed.

1271
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,120
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, and er, she rented</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a short-stay accommodation.</font>

1272
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:09,600
Right. Get Steph to pull a photo
of Crystal from anywhere.

1273
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,440
Get it circulated,

1274
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,000
and I want uniform at the hospital
to meet us!<font color="#ffff00">Yes, ma'am.</font>

1275
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,680
SIRENS

1276
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,560
Why the curtains drawn?

1277
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:31,840
Er, Heidi Stokes, love. Is she OK?
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, she's fine.</font>

1278
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,680
<font color="#00ffff">Does she have a visitor?</font>

1279
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,240
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, she has had a visitor.</font>

1280
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:38,600
You should be with your dad.

1281
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,960
<font color="#ffff00">He's comfortable.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">There's nothing more I can do there.</font>

1282
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,760
<font color="#ffff00">At least I can be useful here.</font>

1283
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,520
You're no used to me, Joe.
Not in the mood you're in.

1284
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,400
<font color="#ffff00">You see me struggling, I'll go.</font>

1285
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,000
<font color="#00ffff">It's definitely Crystal, ma'am!</font>

1286
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,960
<font color="#00ffff">Er, the nurse has just identified</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the photo that Steph sent.</font>

1287
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,720
<font color="#00ffff">She said she's only just left.</font>

1288
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:58,280
Well, she could still be
in the building.

1289
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,520
Check this floor first.

1290
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:03,200
Then main reception and alert
hospital security.<font color="#00ffff">Ma'am.</font>

1291
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,480
Joe.

1292
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,520
Is that her?

1293
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,640
Crystal?

1294
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,840
<font color="#ffff00">Hey! Wait!</font>

1295
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,120
She's heading for the car park.
After her!

1296
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,200
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry. Police.</font>

1297
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,240
CAR ENGINE REVS

1298
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,600
TYRES SCREECH

1299
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:45,720
<font color="#ffff00">Dropped these?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">You're coming with me, Crystal.</font>

1300
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,120
<font color="#00ffff">Ma'am. Carrie's call logs.</font>

1301
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,640
And what's this number?
<font color="#00ffff">Crystal's.</font>

1302
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,960
<font color="#00ffff">Rang Carrie</font>
<font color="#00ffff">several times last Saturday.</font>

1303
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,520
<font color="#00ff00">We also found several demands</font>

1304
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,720
<font color="#00ff00">from credit card providers</font>
<font color="#00ff00">inside her car.</font>

1305
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,520
Well, maybe she needed money.
Maybe that's why she came home?

1306
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,440
<font color="#00ffff">There's also bruising</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to her wrist and neck.</font>

1307
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,120
<font color="#ffff00">Bruising?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">It's fading, but still visible.</font>

1308
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:12,320
<font color="#00ffff">She's refusing</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a medical examination.</font>

1309
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,560
Are they left or right-handed?

1310
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,440
<font color="#00ffff">Carrie left, Crystal right.</font>

1311
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,800
<font color="#00ffff">Spotted when</font>
<font color="#00ffff">they were being booked in.</font>

1312
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:21,480
Mark?
<font color="#00ff00">Ma'am.</font>

1313
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:27,000
<font color="#ffff00">You stayed away for years,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">didn't you, Crystal?</font>

1314
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:31,240
<font color="#ffff00">Determined not to end up</font>
<font color="#ffff00">like your sister? Pregnant.</font>

1315
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,000
<font color="#ffff00">And stuck in dead-end jobs.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">And you didn't.</font>

1316
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,320
<font color="#00ffff">You had a very different life.</font>

1317
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,280
<font color="#00ffff">Till it went wrong.</font>

1318
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,560
Crystal needed money, didn't she?
So, she comes home.

1319
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,800
Goes to see your gran.

1320
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,000
Maybe hoping for a hand-out.

1321
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:48,760
Now it was Crystal the neighbour
saw, outside the house, not you.

1322
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:53,760
And phone records confirm
that she then called you.

1323
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,120
<font color="#00ffff">Did she say she was worried</font>
<font color="#00ffff">about what she'd seen</font>

1324
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,720
<font color="#00ffff">through Heidi's windows?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">No comment.</font>

1325
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,760
<font color="#00ffff">We know that Carrie rang Scott.</font>

1326
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,000
<font color="#ffff00">And he turned up at Heidi's.</font>

1327
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,640
<font color="#ffff00">You confronted him. Right? Argued.</font>

1328
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,960
<font color="#00ffff">We've a witness to another argument.</font>

1329
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,960
<font color="#00ffff">Later on that day in town.</font>

1330
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,720
<font color="#ffff00">Was there a third one, Crystal?</font>

1331
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,520
<font color="#ffff00">Did you meet Scott that night?</font>

1332
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,400
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe he asked to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">at the chip shop, after it closed?</font>

1333
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,480
<font color="#00ff00">No comment.</font>

1334
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,960
It's no good
pretending any more, love!

1335
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,760
Crystal's car was caught on CCTV
picking you up, from work.

1336
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:30,560
And then you both went to that
chip shop together, didn't you?

1337
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,440
<font color="#00ff00">No comment.</font>

1338
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,640
<font color="#ffff00">What about</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the bruises on your neck?</font>

1339
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:38,480
<font color="#00ffff">Did a discussion with Scott</font>
<font color="#00ffff">get a bit out of hand?</font>

1340
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,640
<font color="#00ffff">Turn into a fight?</font>

1341
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,160
<font color="#00ff00">No comment.</font>

1342
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,440
DOOR SLAMS

1343
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,600
<font color="#ffff00">They've agreed not to talk.</font>
Course they have!

1344
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,800
<font color="#ffff00">There's plenty of circumstantial</font>
<font color="#ffff00">evidence to say</font>

1345
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,120
<font color="#ffff00">that they went to the chip shop,</font>

1346
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,000
<font color="#ffff00">but nothing definitive,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to put them there.</font>

1347
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,080
So, let's find something.
Track their movements.

1348
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,640
ANPR on Crystal's car.

1349
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:11,040
Cell site data and GPS
from both their phones.

1350
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:14,280
In the meantime,
let's go harass a pathologist.

1351
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,880
<font color="#00ffff">Do you know how many strings</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I pulled to get</font>

1352
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,600
<font color="#00ffff">these results fast tracked?</font>

1353
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:22,280
<font color="#00ffff">The blood on the cloths</font>
<font color="#00ffff">is confirmed as Scott Rhodes'.</font>

1354
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,480
<font color="#00ffff">And yes, we did manage</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to recover additional DNA.</font>

1355
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,160
<font color="#00ffff">Before you get excited,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">it's not a match for Carrie</font>

1356
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,880
<font color="#00ffff">or Crystal Hawton's sample.</font>

1357
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,400
So what can you tell us
from this DNA?

1358
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,680
<font color="#00ffff">It's a man's.</font>

1359
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,960
Carrie and her sister were there.

1360
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I'd lend money on it.

1361
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,640
Crystal was onto Scott.

1362
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,840
She picks up Carrie
at gone midnight.

1363
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,440
<font color="#ffff00">And now we're told there was</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a fella there, too. Unknown to us?</font>

1364
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:52,520
Well, I think we have to assume
we do know him.

1365
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,240
But who?

1366
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:58,320
I mean,
it wasn't that fisherman fella.

1367
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,800
His late-night poker game
checked out.

1368
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,840
<font color="#ffff00">Well, we can forget</font>
<font color="#ffff00">about Ross Simmons.</font>

1369
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,040
<font color="#ffff00">And we can let Ollie Keeble go</font>
<font color="#ffff00">back to his football,</font>

1370
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,800
<font color="#ffff00">cos neither</font>
<font color="#ffff00">of their DNA samples matched.</font>

1371
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:12,720
And Tyler would be a familial
match to his mam, and Crystal.

1372
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:16,080
Not that I can imagine a teenager
getting the kitchen that clean.

1373
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,240
<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

1374
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,920
How could...

1375
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:32,560
Listen, whoever cleaned
that kitchen.... was diligent.

1376
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,160
Fastidious.

1377
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,320
And familiar with the place...

1378
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:40,360
<font color="#ffff00">Ant Daleson,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">he left the shop just after closing.</font>

1379
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,760
<font color="#ffff00">His mum confirmed he was at home.</font>

1380
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:44,040
<font color="#ffff00">He was there when his brother</font>
<font color="#ffff00">was rushed to hospital.</font>

1381
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,360
Joe, who made the 999 call?
<font color="#ffff00">His mam.</font>

1382
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,040
Did he go in the ambulance?

1383
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,880
HE EXHALES
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know, but I mean...</font>

1384
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,960
It would explain
the job not being finished.

1385
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Get Mark to check
with the attending paramedics.

1386
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:02,000
Did they actually see him
in the family home?

1387
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,440
And if they didn't,

1388
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:07,680
get them to find out how
and when he did get to the hospital!

1389
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:12,440
DOORBELL

1390
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,400
Hi. Sorry, love.

1391
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,600
We need to have a little chat.

1392
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:25,920
MOBILE RINGS

1393
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:38,160
<font color="#00ffff">So, what's this about, then?</font>

1394
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,000
Cleaning cloths, love.

1395
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:43,080
Found in Pat Helliwell's bins.

1396
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:47,760
The ones used to scrub Scott's blood
from the chip shop kitchen.

1397
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:51,520
And we believe your DNA is on them.

1398
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:56,040
Cos you were there when it happened,
weren't yer?

1399
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,680
With Carrie and Crystal Hawton.

1400
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,840
All three of you.

1401
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,880
<font color="#00ffff">I went home after work.</font>

1402
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:06,160
Well, according to the paramedics
who attended for your brother,

1403
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:09,080
only your mam was at home
with Finlay.

1404
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,440
<font color="#ffff00">We've seen your phone logs.</font>

1405
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,640
<font color="#ffff00">We know that your mam called you</font>

1406
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,320
<font color="#ffff00">just after she called</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for an ambulance.</font>

1407
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,240
Now, why would she do that?

1408
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:19,000
Call you, if you were
already in the house with her?

1409
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,480
<font color="#00ffff">Well, I... I must've been.</font>

1410
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,400
You were still at work, love.

1411
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:27,920
Still at Simmons Chip Shop.

1412
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,240
And you took a taxi to the hospital.

1413
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,120
See, it didn't make sense to me,

1414
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:37,720
why someone would do all
that cleaning up

1415
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,080
and then leave his body behind.

1416
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:44,680
Didn't even dispose
of those cloths very well.

1417
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:48,280
<font color="#ffff00">Not to mention the chip pan.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Or the knife.</font>

1418
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,880
But it was because of
your brother, wasn't it?

1419
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:54,600
You needed to get to the hospital
for Finley. And your mam.

1420
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:59,000
<font color="#00ffff">Just finished cleaning up</font>
<font color="#00ffff">when she rang.</font>

1421
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:02,440
<font color="#00ffff">Scared.</font>

1422
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,880
<font color="#00ffff">Wondering where I was.</font>

1423
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,960
<font color="#00ffff">I asked mam to lie about</font>
<font color="#00ffff">when I came home.</font>

1424
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,320
So you hid the body out of sight,

1425
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,480
planning to come back
the next day to deal with it?

1426
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,800
<font color="#ffff00">But Rachel Lim ruined that plan.</font>

1427
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,400
<font color="#00ffff">I'm sorry she had to see that.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Scott.</font>

1428
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,920
<font color="#00ffff">He only cared about himself, really.</font>

1429
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:28,960
<font color="#00ffff">Didn't he? Not the shop.</font>

1430
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,800
<font color="#00ffff">Or Carrie. Tyler.</font>

1431
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,320
<font color="#00ffff">Tyler would come in sometimes.</font>

1432
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,560
<font color="#00ffff">Reminded me of our Finn.</font>

1433
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,720
<font color="#00ffff">I'd slip him a fish supper.</font>

1434
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:47,160
So, what happened that evening,
love?

1435
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:50,840
<font color="#00ffff">Scott were rude to Rachel.</font>

1436
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
<font color="#00ffff">Ruder than usual.</font>

1437
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:01,720
<font color="#00ffff">I got upset. Left early</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and I just... walked round.</font>

1438
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,640
<font color="#00ffff">Over an hour. Trying to calm down.</font>

1439
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:12,280
<font color="#ffff00">But then you went back to the shop?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

1440
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,880
<font color="#00ffff">I were hoping Ross was still there.</font>

1441
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:17,200
<font color="#00ffff">Wanted to say summat.</font>

1442
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:19,480
<font color="#00ffff">But Ross had gone</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and so had Rachel.</font>

1443
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,320
<font color="#00ffff">And there was Scott.</font>

1444
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,720
<font color="#00ffff">He were attacking a woman.</font>

1445
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,440
<font color="#00ffff">And that ain't right.</font>

1446
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,880
And then what?

1447
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:33,440
<font color="#00ffff">I got involved. And... killed him.</font>

1448
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,280
How?

1449
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,720
<font color="#00ffff">What?</font>
Well, how'd you kill him?

1450
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,200
<font color="#00ffff">I shouted.</font>

1451
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,080
<font color="#00ffff">And Scott went for me.</font>

1452
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,800
<font color="#00ffff">So I... I grabbed something.</font>

1453
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:53,800
<font color="#00ffff">Hit him.</font>

1454
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,120
And that was it?

1455
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,800
<font color="#00ffff">No. I...</font>

1456
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,720
<font color="#00ffff">I snatched a knife</font>
<font color="#00ffff">from the side, too.</font>

1457
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,640
<font color="#00ffff">And I stabbed him.</font>

1458
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,160
YOU did?
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

1459
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:14,160
<font color="#00ffff">And afterwards, Crystal told me</font>
<font color="#00ffff">why Scott went for her.</font>

1460
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:17,600
<font color="#00ffff">And how they knew what he'd done</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to their gran.</font>

1461
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,520
<font color="#ffff00">That blow to the head would've</font>
<font color="#ffff00">been enough to stop him.</font>

1462
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,920
<font color="#ffff00">Why'd you stab him as well?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I was... angry.</font>

1463
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:30,560
Now, you remember
the first day we met, love?

1464
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,520
You made us tea, in that lovely pot.

1465
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,120
<font color="#00ffff">What? What? Yeah. Yeah, what?</font>

1466
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:41,000
Well, when you poured the tea...
you used your right hand, love.

1467
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:52,560
It was Carrie, wasn't it,
who stabbed him?

1468
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,960
She took the knife in her left hand

1469
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,160
and stabbed him in his right side.

1470
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,400
Now, you listen to me, love.

1471
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,000
You stumbled into that fight.

1472
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,160
You just wanted to talk to Ross.

1473
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,360
No idea Scott was still there.

1474
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,760
You certainly,
had no intention of killing him.

1475
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:21,280
Now, if you take full blame
for this,

1476
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:27,120
you're looking at 15 years inside,
pet, minimum.

1477
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,080
<font color="#00ffff">I killed him.</font>

1478
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,720
<font color="#00ffff">I'll take the full blame.</font>

1479
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,640
No, don't do this, love,
just don't do it!

1480
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,400
<font color="#00ffff">I did it!</font>

1481
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,160
JOE:<font color="#ffff00">I see.</font>

1482
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,160
<font color="#ffff00">No. No.</font>

1483
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,680
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks.</font>

1484
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:17,120
He's taking it all on himself
to protect Carrie,

1485
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:20,320
cos she was nicer to him
than Scott ever was!

1486
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:24,040
<font color="#ffff00">And Tyler.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Knew they'd be separated.</font>

1487
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:27,360
Well, he's gonna be separated
from his brother!

1488
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:28,920
Him and his mam!

1489
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,080
What's up?

1490
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:38,640
<font color="#ffff00">Er, that was Celine on the phone.</font>

1491
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,200
<font color="#ffff00">Calling from the hospice.</font>

1492
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:44,160
<font color="#ffff00">They tried calling earlier.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">To tell us I should...</font>

1493
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:49,880
<font color="#ffff00">Doesn't matter now, though.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">It's too late.</font>

1494
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,640
<font color="#ffff00">He's gone.</font>

1495
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,120
Hey, Joe, I...

1496
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,680
'There's no point
in still keeping quiet, pet.'

1497
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,080
It all fits.

1498
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:37,120
We've got ANPR flags
on Crystal's car.

1499
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:40,280
Heading towards the chip shop
and then back again within the hour.

1500
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:43,640
Plus we've got GPS data
on your phone,

1501
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:47,560
which confirms everything
that Ant Daleson told us.

1502
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,320
<font color="#00ff00">What... What'd he tell you?</font>

1503
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:52,280
That he'd killed Scott.

1504
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,760
That he was planning
on taking the full blame.

1505
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:01,480
But it was you who stabbed him?
Wasn't it?

1506
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:08,960
Oh, I can understand
you being angry with Scott.

1507
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,680
After everything he'd done.

1508
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:14,920
And I don't believe
you intended to kill him.

1509
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:20,360
Things just got out of hand,
isn't that what happened?

1510
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:27,760
And I know you're not gonna let that
sweet fella

1511
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,760
take the full rap.

1512
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,480
Nah.

1513
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,520
<font color="#00ff00">It happened so fast.</font>

1514
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:46,360
<font color="#00ff00">Scott went for Crystal.</font>

1515
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:48,960
<font color="#00ff00">Then Ant.</font>

1516
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:53,760
<font color="#00ff00">I don't even remember grabbing</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the knife.</font>

1517
01:24:55,480 --> 01:25:00,320
So, he hit him, and you stabbed him.

1518
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:03,240
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, I did.</font>

1519
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:08,160
Well, I need to hear you say it,
pet.

1520
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:12,760
<font color="#00ff00">I stabbed Scott.</font>

1521
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,720
<font color="#00ff00">I just... I had to stop him.</font>

1522
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:23,520
Well, I'm sorry, to tell you Carrie.

1523
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:29,040
You will be charged
with the murder of Scott Rhodes.

1524
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,720
<font color="#ffff00">Room for one more?</font>

1525
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:59,920
<font color="#ffff00">Call it a thank you.</font>
Oh.

1526
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:02,080
For what?

1527
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,680
Getting you back on the team?

1528
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:06,240
Giving you advice you ignore?
SHE CHUCKLES

1529
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:11,080
<font color="#ffff00">So, you got a confession</font>
<font color="#ffff00">from Carrie, then?</font>

1530
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,680
<font color="#ffff00">Justice was done.</font>

1531
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:17,240
I suppose you could say that.
Erm...

1532
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:26,240
We got the ANPR,
and GPS evidence to place her there.

1533
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:30,480
Plus, we had a chat,
I told her what Ant was planning

1534
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:33,000
and gave her a little perspective.

1535
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:37,240
<font color="#ffff00">What a mess.</font>
Aye.

1536
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:40,680
So that least now
you can concentrate on your family.

1537
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:47,760
Funeral arrangements sorted?

1538
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:50,360
<font color="#ffff00">Aye. Tuesday. 2pm. St Mary's.</font>

1539
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,080
<font color="#ffff00">Up in Palmersville.</font>

1540
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,960
Aye. I know it.

1541
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Mmm.

1542
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:10,040
You're ambitious, Joe.

1543
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,640
And you take your work seriously.

1544
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,160
And you'll go far.

1545
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,160
I've always known it.

1546
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:22,160
But career, money, and all
the other things people chase after.

1547
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:25,200
They're not what people remember
in the end?

1548
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,240
<font color="#ffff00">No, they're not?</font>
No.

1549
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:30,400
No, it's people.

1550
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,440
Your people.

1551
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:42,240
You know, you don't have to be
the strong silent type as a dad.

1552
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:48,040
<font color="#ffff00">Is that why you stay up here?</font>

1553
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:51,360
<font color="#ffff00">You wanna make a connection</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to your dad?</font>

1554
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:55,760
We were on different paths.

1555
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:59,800
But I'm glad we ended up
in the same space.

1556
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:03,120
<font color="#ffff00">Ah, well. It makes it easier</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to keep people at a distance</font>

1557
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:07,160
No, I have my people, Joe.

1558
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,480
Not living with me, thank God.

1559
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:13,080
And no family any more.

1560
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:18,640
But colleagues.
<font color="#ffff00">Here's to that, eh?</font>

1561
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:22,000
<font color="#ffff00">To colleagues.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">And to fathers lost.</font>

1562
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:24,400
Aye. To colleagues.

1563
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,560
And to fathers still with us.

1564
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:27,600
SHE CHUCKLES

1565
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:32,160
That's a lovely drop.
You can come again.

1566
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,840
SHE CHUCKLES

1567
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,280
<font color="#ffff00">I'm glad you liked that.</font>

1568
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,480
