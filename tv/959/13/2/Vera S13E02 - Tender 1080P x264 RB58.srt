Yeah. Don't make a fuss, I'm fine!

So, this level crossing,
it's just for pedestrians, is it?

Where's the deceased?

57
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,280
Over there.
She was found by ramblers.

00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,400
<font color="#ffff00">We've stopped the trains</font>
<font color="#ffff00">while we work.</font>

Ah, well, that's nice to know

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,640
we're not gonna be flattened by
a high-speed express (!)

Thanks.

<font color="#00ffff">Vera! You made it.</font>

63
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,080
Well, it's a bit of a walk
from back there.

64
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,560
<font color="#00ffff">DI Ashworth.</font>

65
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,720
<font color="#ffff00">So... what can you tell us?</font>

66
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,880
We've a female. Early 20s.

67
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,400
<font color="#00ffff">Looks a little undernourished,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">but otherwise healthy.</font>

68
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,720
Well, "undernourished"
doesn't exactly scream

69
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,240
"regular rambler", does it?

70
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,000
Nor do her clothes.

71
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,200
Or those nails.
<font color="#00ffff">Not your style?</font>

72
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,040
<font color="#00ffff">Overnight rains</font>
<font color="#00ffff">made a mess of the ground.</font>

73
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,120
<font color="#00ffff">But I think she fell here.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Not moved postmortem.</font>

74
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,600
Anything to give us ID?

75
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,560
<font color="#00ffff">She'd nothing on her. No purse.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">No bank cards. No mobile.</font>

76
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,720
<font color="#ffff00">Hence getting a search started.</font>

77
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,240
<font color="#ffff00">Could it have been a theft</font>
<font color="#ffff00">gone wrong?</font>

78
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,040
It's hardly a likely spot
for a mugging, is it?

79
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,640
How long's she been here?

80
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,080
<font color="#00ffff">Late afternoon yesterday.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Early evening maybe?</font>

81
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,280
And cause of death?

82
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,480
<font color="#00ffff">Tricky. Possibly asphyxiation.</font>

83
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,640
<font color="#00ffff">There are petechial haemorrhages</font>
<font color="#00ffff">on the inside of the eyelids.</font>

84
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,040
<font color="#00ffff">But no strangle marks.</font>

85
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,600
<font color="#00ffff">And rain notwithstanding,</font>

86
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
<font color="#00ffff">the ground doesn't look scuffed</font>
<font color="#00ffff">from a struggle.</font>

87
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,880
<font color="#ffff00">And on her cheek -</font>
<font color="#ffff00">is that a slap mark?</font>

88
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,080
<font color="#00ffff">Likely, yes. Plus, see here...</font>

89
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,760
<font color="#00ffff">Bruising. Looks like</font>
<font color="#00ffff">she was grabbed by someone hard.</font>

90
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,240
Well, that's a struggle in my book.

91
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,760
<font color="#00ffff">Also, on her back.</font>

92
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,440
<font color="#00ffff">Looks like a fall injury to me.</font>

93
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,000
<font color="#00ffff">All the bruises antemortem,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of course.</font>

94
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,040
Well, strangled or not,
she was in a fight.

95
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,240
<font color="#ffff00">Any indication of sexual assault?</font>

96
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,520
<font color="#00ffff">No, thankfully.</font>

97
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,720
<font color="#00ffff">But I can tell you more</font>
<font color="#00ffff">once I get her to the lab.</font>

98
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,320
<font color="#00ffff">But, at this point,</font>

99
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,520
<font color="#00ffff">while I can't definitively say</font>
<font color="#00ffff">it's murder...</font>

100
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,200
It's not looking good.
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

101
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,560
Well, finding her out here
all on her own told me that, love.

102
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,400
Well, thanks, Paula.

103
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,640
Now, I think we should assume
she's not a regular hiker.

104
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,400
So what's she doing here?

105
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,640
Hm? Is she local?

106
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,560
How'd she get here?

107
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,840
<font color="#ffff00">Dropped off by car?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Walked from a train station?</font>

108
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,200
Yeah, was she with anyone?

109
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
Meeting someone?
MARK:<font color="#00ff00">Ma'am.</font>

110
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,440
<font color="#ffff00">Have we started that search</font>
<font color="#ffff00">along the tracks yet?</font>

111
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,600
<font color="#ffff00">And the door knocks?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Er, yes.</font>

112
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,960
<font color="#00ff00">And I'll check for any CCTV spots</font>
<font color="#00ff00">that might help.</font>

113
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,920
Ah, well,
I won't hold my breath on that.

114
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,480
<font color="#00ff00">Er, the rail company are hassling</font>
<font color="#00ff00">for when they can reopen the line.</font>

115
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,280
Ah, well, that's an easy one, Mark.

116
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,560
It'll be when I'm done.
<font color="#00ff00">Ma'am.</font>

117
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,800
Now, where's Kenny?

118
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,880
Is he the only one of us
having a lie-in?<font color="#00ffff">Along there.</font>

119
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,080
<font color="#00ffff">He's talking to the rambler</font>
<font color="#00ffff">who found the dead body.</font>

120
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,680
Oh, right, I'd like to talk to
this rambler myself.

121
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,080
Joe, you stay here,
supervise the search?

122
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,960
RAMBLER:<font color="#ffff00">Been getting Niall</font>
<font color="#ffff00">into hiking.</font>

123
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,040
<font color="#ffff00">Planned a dawn walk, you know,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">catch the sunrise.</font>

124
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,560
<font color="#ffff00">See something beautiful.</font>

125
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah. And where have you come from,
love?

126
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,920
<font color="#ffff00">We live in Fensham.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Couple of miles north, ma'am.</font>

127
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,320
I know.
<font color="#ffff00">Walked south.</font>

128
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,760
<font color="#ffff00">Aimed to go east over the tracks</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and then loop back up.</font>

129
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,080
But then you saw...
<font color="#ffff00">Aye.</font>

130
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,080
<font color="#ffff00">I thought she was plastic at first.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">A mannequin or something, you know?</font>

131
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,160
<font color="#ffff00">Then I realised,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and I pulled him back.</font>

132
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,640
You didn't recognise her?
<font color="#ffff00">Me? No. No.</font>

133
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,600
Now, are you sure, love?
Did you get a good look?

134
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,320
<font color="#ffff00">You're not asking us</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to look again, are you?</font>

135
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,720
Nah, you're all right, pet.

136
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,680
Now, is there anything else
you can tell us

137
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,600
that might help, love?

138
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,760
<font color="#ffff00">No. Nothing.</font>

139
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,520
OK, pet.
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, hang on.</font>

140
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,080
<font color="#ffff00">Erm, I found this...</font>
<font color="#ffff00">further down the trail.</font>

141
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,160
How far down the trail?
<font color="#ffff00">About 50 yards?</font>

142
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,840
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry. I put it in my pocket,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and then...</font>

143
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,280
<font color="#ffff00">I realised, and I just remembered.</font>

144
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
<font color="#ffff00">I mean it could have been dropped</font>
<font color="#ffff00">by anyone, right?</font>

145
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,400
Ah, well,
better late than never, love.

146
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,640
Thanks.
<font color="#00ff00">Cheers.</font>

147
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Steph, we need into that
as soon as possible.

148
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,320
<font color="#ffff00">This credit card was found</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in the cover of the phone.</font>

149
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,040
<font color="#ffff00">Name's a Mrs H A Rushden.</font>

150
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,040
<font color="#00ff00">So, is she our deceased?</font>
Dunno.

151
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,240
Get onto the bank
and find her details.

152
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,560
<font color="#00ff00">Right.</font> <font color="#ffff00">Maybe we should go back</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to your rambler again.</font>

153
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,320
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, do you really buy that he</font>
<font color="#ffff00">just forgot picking up the phone?</font>

154
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,840
Oh, he was rattled.

155
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,240
It's not every day of the week
you find a dead body, Joe.

156
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,000
Ah, but you're right.

157
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,400
Kenny, er, chase up his movements
for yesterday.

158
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,240
And do a background check
while you're at it.<font color="#00ff00">Yes, ma'am.</font>

159
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,480
Oh, and, Kenny, get forensics
to check for any signs of a scuffle

160
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,240
up to 200 yards along the trail.

161
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,880
<font color="#00ff00">Will do, ma'am?</font>

162
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,880
<font color="#00ffff">Ma'am.</font> <font color="#ffff00">You're not</font>
<font color="#ffff00">into that already, are you?</font>

163
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,240
<font color="#00ffff">Not past the face ID and passcode,</font>

164
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,840
<font color="#00ffff">but there's</font>
<font color="#00ffff">medical information here.</font>

165
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,680
<font color="#00ffff">So, you can make emergency calls</font>

166
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,240
<font color="#00ffff">from a locked screen</font>
<font color="#00ffff">by pressing here,</font>

167
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,120
<font color="#00ffff">But you can also fill in</font>
<font color="#00ffff">medical information.</font>

168
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,080
<font color="#00ffff">I've done it on mine. Accessed here.</font>

169
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,560
<font color="#00ffff">And according to this, the phone</font>
<font color="#00ffff">belongs to a Gabi Fischer.</font>

170
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,680
Oh, so not your Mrs Rushden
on the credit card?

171
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,800
<font color="#00ffff">No, but there's an emergency contact</font>
<font color="#00ffff">down as Helen Rushden.</font>

172
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,440
<font color="#ffff00">So might not be the deceased,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">but could be next of kin.</font>

173
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,000
Call that number, find an address.

174
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,560
Get uniform over there.

175
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,200
But tell 'em to act dumb
until we arrive.

176
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,920
Well done, Steph.
<font color="#00ffff">Ma'am.</font>

177
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,320
Are you coming?
Before I get blocked in.

178
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,480
<font color="#ffff00">Helen Rushden's waiting.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">She's very worked up, apparently.</font>

179
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,840
<font color="#ffff00">And her adult son's</font>
<font color="#ffff00">just turned up, too.</font>

180
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,920
<font color="#ffff00">Is something wrong?</font>

181
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,320
Well, this, the Rushdens.

182
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,360
You've got Dad, Mam,
son and daughter.

183
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,040
But that's not our deceased, is it?

184
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,240
So maybe she's an in-law?
WOMAN:<font color="#00ffff">What's going on now?</font>

185
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,360
<font color="#00ffff">Who are you?</font>
Ah, Mrs Rushden.

186
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,040
DCI Vera Stanhope.
And this is DS...

187
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,840
This is DI Joe Ashworth.

188
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,040
<font color="#00ffff">Will someone just please</font>
<font color="#00ffff">tell me what's happening?</font>

189
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,840
<font color="#00ffff">Is this about Gabi?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">You know Gabi Fischer?</font>

190
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,640
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, she lives here!</font>

191
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,240
Is she a family member?
<font color="#00ff00">No.</font>

192
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,720
<font color="#00ff00">But she's been living with Mam</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the last few months.</font>

193
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,280
Then I think
we better all sit down, love.

194
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,480
<font color="#00ffff">Just tell me.</font>

195
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,360
Well, we're here
because we found a mobile phone

196
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,520
with emergency information on it.

197
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,120
<font color="#00ffff">Is it Gabi's phone? I...</font>

198
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,360
<font color="#00ffff">I got her to put all that in</font>
<font color="#00ffff">when she got sick.</font>

199
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,920
<font color="#ffff00">Sick?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

200
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,600
<font color="#00ffff">She's got cancer.</font>

201
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,440
<font color="#00ffff">Now... where is she?</font>

202
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,640
Well, I'm afraid
we also found a body, love.

203
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,640
<font color="#00ffff">What?</font>

204
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,640
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

205
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,760
<font color="#00ffff">No!</font>

206
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,880
I'm sorry.
<font color="#00ffff">No...</font>

207
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,560
<font color="#00ffff">She came into one of my shops.</font>

208
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,600
<font color="#00ffff">Five, six months ago?</font>

209
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,520
<font color="#00ffff">I own a chain of coffee places -</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Grounded Out.</font>

210
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,400
<font color="#00ffff">Jonathon runs them with me.</font>
Oh, aye.

211
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,520
There's one near my station.
Aye, looks lovely.

212
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,680
<font color="#00ff00">Mum grew it from just one place</font>
<font color="#00ff00">into seven branches.</font>

213
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,640
<font color="#00ffff">Well, I was in one,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and Gabi appeared, looking upset.</font>

214
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,680
<font color="#00ffff">I've a daughter a similar age.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Fiona.</font>

215
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,560
<font color="#00ffff">Anyway... We-We got talking, and...</font>

216
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,440
<font color="#00ffff">well, I just liked her</font>
<font color="#00ffff">straight away.</font>

217
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,880
<font color="#00ffff">But she was having money troubles.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Sofa surfing.</font>

218
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,440
<font color="#00ffff">She just seemed... vulnerable.</font>

219
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,960
<font color="#00ffff">So I tried to help her.</font>

220
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,160
Go on, love.

221
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,680
<font color="#00ffff">Well, she turned up regularly,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and we became friends.</font>

222
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,920
<font color="#00ffff">Then she got back pain.</font>

223
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,360
<font color="#00ffff">Was it three months or so ago?</font>

224
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,920
<font color="#00ffff">She was getting breathless as well.</font>

225
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,280
<font color="#00ffff">I made her get it checked out,</font>

226
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,520
<font color="#00ffff">never imagining the diagnosis</font>
<font color="#00ffff">would be Hodgkin lymphoma.</font>

227
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,920
So, is that when she moved in here?

228
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,560
<font color="#00ffff">Gabi had every chance of recovery</font>
<font color="#00ffff">if she was taken care of.</font>

229
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,240
<font color="#00ffff">And we had the space.</font>

230
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,520
<font color="#00ffff">Jonathon's his own family.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Fiona had gone.</font>

231
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,000
<font color="#00ffff">And she was doing really well.</font>

232
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,480
<font color="#00ffff">Though the chemo was tough.</font>

233
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,720
<font color="#00ffff">Made her tired.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">And her hair. She was...</font>

234
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,480
<font color="#00ffff">..worried she'd have</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to shave it off in the end.</font>

235
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,560
Why didn't she go
to her own family for help?

236
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,120
<font color="#00ffff">They'd thrown her out. Abusive.</font>

237
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,680
<font color="#00ffff">Emotionally, if not physically.</font>

238
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,560
<font color="#ffff00">When did you last see her?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Yesterday.</font>

239
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,880
<font color="#00ffff">I dropped her to the hospital</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for 1:30, then I saw a friend.</font>

240
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,800
<font color="#00ffff">I got a message saying</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Gabi didn't need picking up.</font>

241
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,240
<font color="#00ffff">She needed space of her own</font>
<font color="#00ffff">sometimes.</font>

242
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,200
<font color="#00ffff">Then when</font>
<font color="#00ffff">she didn't come home at all...</font>

243
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,400
And you've no idea,
why she was where we found her?

244
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,320
<font color="#00ffff">No. None.</font>

245
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,120
<font color="#ffff00">How about you, Mr Rushden?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">No idea.</font>

246
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,000
<font color="#00ff00">I was at my place all day.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I didn't hear from her.</font>

247
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,360
And you don't know anyone
who might have wanted to harm her?

248
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,200
SHE SCOFFS

249
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,240
<font color="#00ffff">Gabi was the sweetest, warmest...</font>

250
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,480
<font color="#00ffff">Who would wanna hurt her?</font>

251
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,280
<font color="#ffff00">So, we still need to locate</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and inform her next of kin.</font> Aye.

252
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,360
Not least to chat about
this "abuse".<font color="#00ff00">Excuse me.</font>

253
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,920
<font color="#00ff00">I just wanna let you know there's</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a different perspective to me mam's.</font>

254
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,720
<font color="#ffff00">On Gabi?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah.</font>

255
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,880
<font color="#00ff00">Look, Mam gave up a lot for her.</font>

256
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,080
<font color="#00ff00">Stepped back from work</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and everything.</font>

257
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,280
<font color="#00ff00">But it drove a wedge</font>
<font color="#00ff00">between her and Dad.</font>

258
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,440
A "wedge"? What's that mean?

259
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,000
<font color="#00ff00">They're separated.</font>

260
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,200
What? Because of Gabi?

261
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,440
<font color="#00ff00">The attention she took. Demanded.</font>

262
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,840
<font color="#00ff00">There was no space left for Dad.</font>

263
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,600
<font color="#ffff00">So, he moved out?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Squeezed out, more like.</font>

264
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,040
Well, thanks, love.

265
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,080
Well,
that IS a different perspective.

266
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,000
<font color="#00ff00">Nice.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">This is good work, you know.</font>

267
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,640
<font color="#00ff00">Lovely.</font>

268
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,600
<font color="#00ff00">She's in good condition.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">What's wrong with her?</font>

269
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,080
Nothing.
<font color="#ffff00">That's not why we're here.</font>

270
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,760
Tom Rushden?
<font color="#00ff00">Yes.</font>

271
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,200
Ah, DCI Stanhope.

272
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,880
Now, is there somewhere
we can chat, love?

273
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,880
Had you seen Gabi recently?

274
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,640
<font color="#00ff00">No.</font>

275
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,640
<font color="#00ff00">Please. Sorry, sit down.</font>

276
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,320
Now, your son, Jonathon, suggested
that there was no love lost

277
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,480
between you and her, is that right?

278
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,480
<font color="#00ff00">I guess that's fair enough.</font>

279
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,360
<font color="#ffff00">You hadn't liked her moving in?</font>

280
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,880
<font color="#00ff00">I hadn't liked her and Helen,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">full stop.</font>

281
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,040
<font color="#00ff00">Things happened so quickly.</font>

282
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,360
<font color="#00ff00">They'd only just met</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and were suddenly best friends.</font>

283
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,080
<font color="#00ff00">Then something more.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Like Mummy and daughter.</font>

284
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,880
<font color="#00ff00">And, yes, Gabi was vulnerable.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Then sick.</font>

285
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,200
<font color="#00ff00">But you can have cancer</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and still be a leech.</font>

286
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,000
Oh, is that what you thought
she was, a leech?

287
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,720
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, she fed off Helen.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Clung to her.</font>

288
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,960
<font color="#00ff00">Gabi moving in</font>
<font color="#00ff00">was supposed to be temporary.</font>

289
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,880
<font color="#00ff00">But once she was in...</font>
She wasn't going anywhere.

290
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,600
<font color="#00ff00">If anyone was...</font>

291
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,920
<font color="#00ff00">..was me.</font>

292
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,400
<font color="#ffff00">You really feel she pushed you out?</font>

293
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,680
<font color="#00ff00">Me and Helen planned</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a night out once.</font>

294
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,880
<font color="#00ff00">Our anniversary.</font>

295
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,480
<font color="#00ff00">Suddenly,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Gabi had breathing difficulties.</font>

296
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,800
<font color="#00ff00">Then a full-blown panic attack.</font>

297
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,920
<font color="#00ff00">Helen felt she had to stay.</font>

298
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,080
<font color="#00ff00">I went on alone.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Had to get out of there.</font>

299
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,640
Why did your missus take her in
in the first place?

300
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
Give her so much?

301
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,040
<font color="#00ff00">After Jonathon and Fiona,</font>

302
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,640
<font color="#00ff00">we'd wanted another but...</font>
<font color="#00ff00">couldn't conceive.</font>

303
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,280
<font color="#00ff00">Maybe there was always a...</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a gap there.</font>

304
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,760
<font color="#00ff00">And Gabi lapped the mothering up.</font>

305
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,520
<font color="#00ff00">Told Helen she made her feel safe.</font>

306
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,000
<font color="#00ff00">Part of the family.</font>

307
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,280
<font color="#00ff00">Ironically, seeing as</font>
<font color="#00ff00">she was splitting one up.</font>

308
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,560
So, where were you, love,
yesterday afternoon and evening?

309
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,880
<font color="#00ff00">I was in the garage</font>
<font color="#00ff00">till pretty late.</font>

310
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,880
<font color="#ffff00">Other mechanics with you?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Well, yes, till 5 PM.</font>

311
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,120
<font color="#00ff00">Then I ended the evening</font>
<font color="#00ff00">back in here.</font>

312
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,600
OK, love. Thanks for your time.

313
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,680
That collection of empties he's got

314
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,000
tells me he's not coping
away from home.

315
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,440
<font color="#ffff00">Aye, so this interloper's arrival</font>
<font color="#ffff00">cost him a lot.</font> Aye.

316
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,880
<font color="#ffff00">Or did he win you over</font>
<font color="#ffff00">by being nice about your car?</font>

317
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,360
I want his alibi checked.

318
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,720
<font color="#ffff00">Headache?</font>

319
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,600
Nah, I've got a grumbly tooth,
if you must know.

320
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,880
Who is doing background checks
on the Rushdens?

321
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,640
<font color="#ffff00">Mark.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Well, let's see what that tells us.</font>

322
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,000
Gabi Fischer, early 20s.

323
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,880
Her body was found
near Fensham level crossing

324
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
this morning by a rambler.

325
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,160
Now, we don't know
if this is murder... yet.

326
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,400
We're still waiting on the results
of the postmortem.

327
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,280
But we are treating her death
as suspicious.

328
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,000
Now, she'd been diagnosed
with Hodgkin lymphoma.

329
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,880
So, Steph,
get on to her hospital team

330
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,680
and see if they can tell us
anything more.

331
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,600
Now, where are we
with her last known movements?

332
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,480
<font color="#00ffff">Nothing from door-to-door yet,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">ma'am,</font>

333
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,600
<font color="#00ffff">but we're into her phone,</font>

334
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,160
<font color="#00ffff">and I've been going through</font>
<font color="#00ffff">call logs.</font>

335
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,920
<font color="#00ffff">Plus, I found a train app,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with an e-ticket for yesterday.</font>

336
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,120
Ah... so how'd she pay for that?

337
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,880
<font color="#00ffff">She used the credit card</font>
<font color="#00ffff">we found inside the phone cover.</font>

338
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,120
And now Mrs Rushden said she gave
her that card for emergencies,

339
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,560
so what was the emergency?

340
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,080
<font color="#ffff00">Where was the ticket to?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Er, Bewton.</font>

341
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,680
<font color="#00ffff">It's a small town just...</font>
No, I know it.

342
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,320
She'd have had to change trains.

343
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,480
So she could have got off at Bewton
and hiked north.

344
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,800
Then over the level crossing.

345
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,560
Mark, we need the CCTV
from the train and the station.

346
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,560
Let's try and pin her down.

347
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,480
See if anyone was with her.
<font color="#00ff00">Ma'am.</font>

348
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,240
Now, meanwhile, she'd been staying

349
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,560
under the auspices
of Helen Rushden in Newcastle.

350
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,840
No relation.

351
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,360
So we still need to track down
her legal next of kin.

352
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,440
Mark, I want you on that.

353
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,000
<font color="#ffff00">Anything on the Rushdens, Mark?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Er, yeah.</font>

354
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,680
<font color="#00ff00">There was one thing</font>
<font color="#00ff00">on the estranged dad, Tom.</font>

355
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,080
<font color="#00ff00">He had a previous conviction</font>
<font color="#00ff00">for violent affray.</font>

356
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,160
When was that?

357
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,800
<font color="#00ff00">Oh, way back. Er, 1992.</font>

358
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,520
<font color="#00ff00">And he got fined for it,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">but no prison time.</font>

359
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,200
<font color="#00ff00">It was a drunken altercation</font>
<font color="#00ff00">that got out of hand.</font>

360
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,040
OK. All the more reason
to check his alibi.

361
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,560
Now, he said he was at the garage

362
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,760
with the other mechanics till five,
didn't he?<font color="#ffff00">Aye.</font>

363
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,440
Well, see if you can confirm
his whereabouts.

364
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,320
And what about the sister,
Fiona Rushden?

365
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,960
Has anyone made contact with her?

366
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,040
<font color="#00ff00">She's overseas, in Spain, ma'am.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Er, flew out yesterday evening.</font>

367
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,240
Did she now?

368
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,680
Was that before or after
Gabi breathed her last?

369
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,560
<font color="#00ff00">Er, well, she was on</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the 8 PM flight,</font>

370
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,040
<font color="#00ff00">but we don't know</font>
<font color="#00ff00">what time exactly Gabi died, do we?</font>

371
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,360
<font color="#ffff00">Get a message to her, Mark.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">We need her back here.</font>

372
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,720
<font color="#00ffff">Er, I've one other thing</font>
<font color="#00ffff">from Gabi's phone.</font>

373
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,480
<font color="#00ffff">The last person she rang</font>
<font color="#00ffff">was Helen's son, Jonathon.</font>

374
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,920
Is that right?
<font color="#00ffff">Just after 4 PM.</font>

375
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,120
<font color="#00ffff">There were several missed calls</font>
<font color="#00ffff">from him to her, too,</font>

376
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,960
<font color="#00ffff">from 5:20 or so.</font>

377
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,440
<font color="#ffff00">He told us he hadn't spoken to Gabi</font>
<font color="#ffff00">all day.</font>

378
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,480
Aye. He did say that.

379
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,840
Ah, good morning, Mr Rushden.

380
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,920
Thanks for meeting with us.
<font color="#00ffff">DCI Stanhope.</font>

381
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,280
<font color="#00ffff">This is Freya, my wife.</font>
Hello, love.<font color="#00ff00">Hiya.</font>

382
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,320
<font color="#ffff00">And who's this?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">This is my boy.</font>

383
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,920
<font color="#00ffff">Say hello, Jack.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Hello.</font>

384
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,000
<font color="#00ffff">Jack likes to call by</font>
<font color="#00ffff">when we meet branch managers.</font>

385
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,560
<font color="#00ffff">Steals a pastry.</font>

386
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,080
<font color="#00ffff">Er, DCI Stanhope's here</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to talk about Gabi.</font>

387
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,240
<font color="#00ff00">That poor girl. It's so awful.</font>

388
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
<font color="#00ff00">Come on, mister. Park time.</font>

389
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,400
<font color="#00ffff">Ah, shall we take this inside.</font>

390
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,600
<font color="#00ffff">Cheers.</font>

391
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,840
<font color="#00ffff">So... how exactly can I help?</font>

392
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,520
<font color="#ffff00">Well, you didn't mention Gabi</font>
<font color="#ffff00">calling you the day she died.</font>

393
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,320
About 4 PM, love.

394
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,080
Which means, as far as we know,

395
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,640
you were the last person
to have spoken to her.

396
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,280
<font color="#00ffff">She called at... four?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Couldn't have been important.</font>

397
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,800
<font color="#ffff00">No? When your mum was frantic</font>
<font color="#ffff00">about her going missing?</font>

398
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,040
<font color="#00ffff">Well, we didn't know</font>
<font color="#00ffff">she was missing then.</font>

399
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,000
<font color="#00ffff">And we weren't worried till later.</font>

400
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,800
<font color="#00ffff">Gabi passed on little messages</font>
<font color="#00ffff">all the time.</font>

401
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,200
Like what?

402
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,840
<font color="#00ffff">I think it might have been something</font>
<font color="#00ffff">about this weekend.</font>

403
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,440
<font color="#00ffff">Me and Freya coming to Mam's</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for dinner.</font>

404
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,520
What? She called you about that?
From the middle of the countryside?

405
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,240
<font color="#00ffff">I didn't know where she was.</font>

406
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,040
<font color="#00ffff">And, I mean, later,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">when Mam got worried,</font>

407
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,280
<font color="#00ffff">I said I'd try and track Gabi down,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">so I phoned her.</font>

408
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,480
Yeah, we know
about those calls as well, love.

409
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,240
<font color="#ffff00">Which you also didn't mention.</font>

410
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,800
<font color="#00ffff">Hmm. Well, she didn't answer...</font>

411
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,520
<font color="#00ffff">..so I didn't talk to her.</font>

412
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,000
Now, you said you were at home
yesterday.

413
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,200
<font color="#00ffff">That's right. Working.</font>

414
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,840
<font color="#ffff00">All day?</font>

415
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,400
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, I went for a walk</font>
<font color="#00ffff">around the block at lunchtime.</font>

416
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,160
<font color="#ffff00">Can anyone confirm where you were?</font>

417
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,400
<font color="#00ffff">Hm! Freya.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Jack had a nursery day.</font>

418
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,240
<font color="#00ffff">She was around</font>
<font color="#00ffff">except for drop-off and pick-up.</font>

419
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,600
Hmm...

420
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,800
<font color="#ffff00">Mark, any news on the train?</font>

421
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,160
<font color="#00ff00">Er, yeah, I've got her on the train</font>
<font color="#00ff00">CCTV from Newcastle to Bewton.</font>

422
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,600
<font color="#00ff00">Er, she's by herself.</font>

423
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,920
<font color="#00ff00">Disembarks at 3:32,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and then we lose her.</font>

424
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,080
<font color="#00ff00">Er, I also checked to see</font>

425
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,760
<font color="#00ff00">if anyone phoned to use</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the Fensham level crossing.</font>

426
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,960
<font color="#ffff00">Good thinking.</font>
And?

427
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,160
<font color="#00ff00">Er, yeah, they said</font>
<font color="#00ff00">there was a call,</font>

428
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,400
<font color="#00ff00">sounded like a young woman</font>
<font color="#00ff00">at, er, 4:28 PM.</font>

429
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,120
Well, if that was Gabi,

430
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,320
we'd have been right about
her journey.

431
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,240
It's about an hour's hike,
north from Bewton.

432
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,920
Over the level crossing.

433
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,280
But where was she heading?
What was she doing there?

434
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,240
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe she agreed</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to meet her attacker?</font>

435
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,840
<font color="#ffff00">They could've walked together.</font>
Hmm.

436
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,680
Did anyone else call the signalman?
<font color="#00ff00">No, ma'am.</font>

437
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,200
OK, so, let's work backwards.

438
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,880
See if you can pick her up on CCTV

439
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,400
before she gets on the train
at Newcastle.

440
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,640
<font color="#ffff00">Steph, any more on Gabi's phone?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Er, not much.</font>

441
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,840
<font color="#00ffff">The phone itself was a gift</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a few months back</font>

442
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,920
<font color="#00ffff">from Helen Rushden.</font>

443
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,680
<font color="#00ffff">Gabi mainly called</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and messaged Helen.</font>

444
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,960
Don't you find that odd, Steph?

445
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,520
A 20-something lass
only calling her substitute mam?

446
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,200
Hasn't she got any mates?

447
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,400
<font color="#00ffff">There's a handful of other contacts</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to go through.</font>

448
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,080
Yeah, well, make sure you do.

449
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,120
<font color="#00ffff">Er, she's no real social media</font>
<font color="#00ffff">profile to speak of, either, ma'am.</font>

450
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,280
In this day and age?

451
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,520
Mark, how are you doing
tracing her next of kin?

452
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,320
<font color="#00ff00">Er, not great, ma'am.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">It's strange, though.</font>

453
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,840
<font color="#00ff00">I can't find a birth record</font>
<font color="#00ff00">for a Gabi Fischer.</font>

454
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,560
<font color="#00ff00">Not one that matches the birth date</font>
<font color="#00ff00">that Helen gave us.</font> <font color="#ffff00">You what?</font>

455
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,160
<font color="#00ff00">I've tried "Gabrielle",</font>
<font color="#00ff00">"Gabriella"...</font>

456
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,360
So what are we saying?

457
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,560
This Gabi Fischer's
an assumed identity?

458
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,760
Now, how does that work?
How does she go anywhere?

459
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,440
Do anything? Buy anything?

460
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,640
<font color="#ffff00">Well, it sounds like Helen paid for</font>
<font color="#ffff00">most of it.</font>

461
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,120
Hmm.

462
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:25,760
OK, Mark, get onto missing persons.
Forget her name.

463
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,000
And see if you can match her details
to any unsolved cases.

464
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,480
<font color="#00ff00">That's gonna be a lot of people,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">ma'am.</font>

465
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,240
Yeah, well,
you better get on with it, then.

466
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,680
<font color="#ffff00">That was the morgue.</font>

467
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,040
At last! Some solid evidence.

468
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,200
You coming or what?

469
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,920
<font color="#00ffff">Vera!</font>

470
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,640
<font color="#00ffff">I hear we're not sure what name</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to put on the paperwork yet.</font>

471
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,800
Does that change what she died of?
<font color="#00ffff">I suppose not.</font>

472
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,040
<font color="#00ffff">I mentioned asphyxiation.</font>
Aye.

473
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,080
<font color="#ffff00">But not from being strangled.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I was wrong, anyway.</font>

474
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,920
<font color="#00ffff">It was a massive thrombotic</font>
<font color="#00ffff">occlusion of the basilar artery.</font>

475
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,280
A blood clot?

476
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,400
<font color="#00ffff">One that stopped the blood flow</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to her brain, yes.</font>

477
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,560
Caused by what?
<font color="#00ffff">A whiplash-like injury.</font>

478
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,920
<font color="#00ffff">There's a microscopic lesion</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of the right vertebral artery</font>

479
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,480
<font color="#00ffff">on the atlantoaxial joint</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in the neck.</font>

480
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,680
<font color="#00ffff">So I'm guessing,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">there was a fight,</font>

481
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,040
<font color="#00ffff">she was grabbed, shaken</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and pushed backwards.</font>

482
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,320
<font color="#00ffff">She fell and landed on something,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">which bruised her,</font>

483
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,200
<font color="#00ffff">and more importantly,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">jerked her head back,</font>

484
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,360
<font color="#00ffff">causing the lesion.</font>

485
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,920
<font color="#ffff00">And that maps with the surroundings</font>
<font color="#ffff00">where we found her?</font>

486
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,840
<font color="#00ffff">Mm-hm. Correct, DI Ashworth.</font>

487
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,440
<font color="#00ffff">There's tree stumps</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that she more than likely fell on.</font>

488
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,400
OK, thanks, Paula.

489
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,640
<font color="#00ffff">Just one last thing to mention.</font>

490
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,160
<font color="#00ffff">The deceased's cancer diagnosis.</font>
Hodgkin's lymphoma.

491
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,520
<font color="#00ffff">I found no evidence</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for chemo treatment.</font>

492
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,120
<font color="#00ffff">No implanted central line,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">no marks from a cannula site.</font>

493
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,360
What?

494
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,360
<font color="#ffff00">She wasn't receiving treatment?</font>

495
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,040
<font color="#00ffff">She was thin</font>
<font color="#00ffff">but, I think, through dieting.</font>

496
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,280
<font color="#00ffff">And she also had rather heavy</font>
<font color="#00ffff">make-up on which made her look pale.</font>

497
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,600
<font color="#00ffff">And see here...</font>

498
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,920
<font color="#00ffff">The hair's been cut at a few points</font>
<font color="#00ffff">close to the roots.</font>

499
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,800
<font color="#00ffff">So when pulled or brushed,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">it would come loose.</font>

500
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,840
As if it was falling out.

501
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,760
<font color="#00ffff">I've confirmed with blood results</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and a biopsy,</font>

502
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,560
<font color="#00ffff">this young woman didn't have cancer.</font>

503
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,760
<font color="#00ffff">She'd never had cancer.</font>

504
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,640
She was faking it?
<font color="#00ffff">Mm.</font>

505
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,920
You had no clue
she'd been lying to you?

506
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,560
<font color="#00ffff">I took her to the hospital</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for treatment.</font>

507
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,480
<font color="#00ffff">I can show you doctors' letters.</font>

508
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,760
<font color="#00ffff">She put me in touch with</font>
<font color="#00ffff">her cancer nurse, for God sakes!</font>

509
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,440
<font color="#00ffff">Danni, she was called. Danni Verma.</font>

510
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,080
<font color="#ffff00">You never went with her to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">an appointment or treatment session?</font>

511
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,960
<font color="#00ffff">Well, I offered. She didn't want me</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to see that stuff going into her.</font>

512
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,240
There was no diagnosis, love.

513
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,840
<font color="#00ffff">No... no treatments.</font>

514
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,360
No.

515
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,880
<font color="#00ffff">What kind of person lies about that?</font>

516
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,160
How is she?
<font color="#ffff00">Family Liaison's with her.</font>

517
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,840
<font color="#ffff00">This Gabi's room?</font>

518
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,160
Well, it was the daughter's,
Fiona's,

519
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,360
but she's been relegated
to the bottom drawer.

520
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,640
And we still know nothing about
this lass who's replaced her.

521
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,440
<font color="#ffff00">Well, Fiona's flying back tomorrow,</font>

522
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,880
<font color="#ffff00">so maybe that will give us</font>
<font color="#ffff00">something.</font> Right.

523
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,960
Hey, hold on.

524
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,880
Can you pull that out?

525
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,160
<font color="#ffff00">What the hell is that?</font>

526
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,160
And on top of all this,
our Gabi was good at DIY!

527
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,360
<font color="#ffff00">What've we got on this lot</font>
<font color="#ffff00">so far, Mark?</font>

528
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,360
<font color="#00ff00">Er, well, first look at the laptop</font>
<font color="#00ff00">already shows</font>

529
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,920
<font color="#00ff00">forged medical letters</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and several faked email accounts.</font>

530
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,360
<font color="#00ff00">And her online activity includes</font>
<font color="#00ff00">bookmarked pages</font>

531
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,760
<font color="#00ff00">about cancer symptoms</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and support groups.</font>

532
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,560
<font color="#ffff00">And what about the phones</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and the SIM cards?</font>

533
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,400
<font color="#00ffff">Each SIM has letters written on.</font>

534
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,080
<font color="#00ffff">Like "DV" on this one.</font>

535
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,320
<font color="#00ffff">And the texts from this card</font>
<font color="#00ffff">pretend to be from a Danni Verma.</font>

536
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,560
Ah! Now, she told Helen
Danni Verma was her cancer nurse.

537
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,480
<font color="#00ffff">Ah, well, I'll carry on</font>
<font color="#00ffff">going through the SIMs.</font>

538
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,400
What about the drugs?

539
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,880
<font color="#ffff00">Well, they're still at the lab.</font>

540
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,160
<font color="#ffff00">But early testing would suggest that</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that bag was full of ketamine.</font>

541
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,000
Toxicology said
there was nothing in her system.

542
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,760
<font color="#00ff00">So holding them for someone else,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">then?</font>

543
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,520
Could've been selling 'em.

544
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,760
<font color="#00ffff">I've sent a picture of Gabi</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to the hospital.</font> And?

545
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,200
<font color="#ffff00">I was going to follow up in person.</font>

546
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,040
<font color="#ffff00">I'll take Kenny with us,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">if you can spare us?</font>

547
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,720
SHE SIGHS
I'll manage!

548
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,880
<font color="#ffff00">Even if it's just to check the CCTV.</font>

549
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,640
And see if you can find out
exactly what she did

550
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,320
after Helen left her there
for treatment.

551
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,400
Meanwhile,
I have the unenviable task

552
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,600
of informing her next of kin.

553
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:21,120
Maybe find out who Gabrielle McSwain
really was.

554
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,000
SHE SOBS AND PANTS

555
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,920
When did Gabi leave home?

556
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,320
HE EXHALES SHARPLY

557
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,200
<font color="#00ffff">Er, must be... six months ago.</font>

558
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,360
<font color="#00ffff">She didn't tell us</font>
<font color="#00ffff">where she was going.</font>

559
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,920
<font color="#00ffff">She never got in touch.</font>

560
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,440
And you didn't look for her?
Report her missing?

561
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,560
Only...

562
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:12,000
..she'd suggested that something
had happened here at home.

563
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,640
Hinted at abuse.

564
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,240
<font color="#ffff00">Abuse?</font>

565
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,280
<font color="#00ffff">Gabi lied. OK?</font>

566
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,760
<font color="#00ffff">She lied all the time.</font>

567
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,320
<font color="#00ffff">So, when she left...</font>

568
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,400
<font color="#00ffff">Gabi was our daughter,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and we loved her.</font>

569
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,560
<font color="#00ffff">But when she went...</font>

570
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,320
<font color="#00ffff">in some ways, it was a relief.</font>

571
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,000
<font color="#ffff00">Not that she was always...</font>
<font color="#00ffff">No, I know.</font>

572
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,040
<font color="#ffff00">She was happy when she was younger.</font>

573
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,840
So, what changed?

574
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,240
<font color="#00ffff">Her little sister got ill.</font>

575
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,920
Gabi has a sister?

576
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,440
<font color="#00ffff">Emma.</font>

577
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,280
<font color="#00ffff">She died.</font>

578
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,000
I am so sorry.

579
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,680
<font color="#ffff00">Cancer.</font>

580
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,160
<font color="#ffff00">She was 16.</font>

581
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,000
<font color="#ffff00">And that took...</font>

582
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,720
<font color="#ffff00">so much attention.</font>

583
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,120
<font color="#00ffff">Gabi started to get into trouble</font>
<font color="#00ffff">at school.</font>

584
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,800
<font color="#00ffff">Continued after she left.</font>

585
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,920
<font color="#00ffff">Acting out. She took money from us.</font>

586
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,560
<font color="#00ffff">Petty thefts around town.</font>

587
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,600
<font color="#ffff00">We tried to help.</font>

588
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,840
<font color="#00ffff">We got a referral to</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a child psychologist and everything.</font>

589
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,600
There's something else
I need to tell you.

590
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,160
Gabi had been pretending to be ill
with Hodgkin lymphoma.

591
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,520
HE SIGHS
<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

592
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:01,320
<font color="#ffff00">No. No.</font>

593
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,560
<font color="#00ffff">That's what Emma had.</font>

594
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,320
DEBBIE WHIMPERS

595
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,240
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to ask you.

596
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,560
Where were you both
on Wednesday afternoon?

597
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,960
<font color="#00ffff">Debs was on a shift.</font>

598
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,800

599
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,720
<font color="#ffff00">And Matthew would've been out</font>
<font color="#ffff00">on the water.</font>

600
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,880
<font color="#00ffff">I run a potting boat</font>
<font color="#00ffff">out of the harbour.</font>

601
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,800
OK.

602
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
Thanks for your time.

603
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,880
It's much appreciated.

606
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,080
<font color="#00ff00">Aye. Sounds good to me, sir.</font>

607
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,760
<font color="#ffff00">Joe's probably fine, eh, Ken?</font>

608
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,880
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks for sparing</font>
<font color="#ffff00">so much time, Maia.</font>

609
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,080
<font color="#ffff00">I know it can be tedious.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, no problem.</font>

610
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,960
<font color="#ffff00">So, we know</font>
<font color="#ffff00">she was a regular at the cafe,</font>

611
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,200
<font color="#ffff00">but do we know who that is,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">sat next to her?</font>

612
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,440
<font color="#00ffff">Sorry. There's 4,000 employees</font>
<font color="#00ffff">at this hospital.</font>

613
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,280

614
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,680
<font color="#00ffff">Should narrow it down.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">OK, great.</font>

615
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,480
<font color="#ffff00">Can I get all this footage</font>
<font color="#ffff00">sent over?</font>

616
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,040

<font color="#00ffff">Sure. Anything you want.</font>

617
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,560
<font color="#ffff00">'Scuse me. Boss?</font>

618
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,560
<font color="#ffff00">'How did you get on with</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the family?'</font>

619
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,560
Well, wait for it...

620
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,040
She had a younger sister
who died of cancer.

621
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,440
<font color="#ffff00">You're kidding?!</font>
'Aye. You couldn't make it up.'

622
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,520
And they painted Gabi
as being involved in all sorts.

623
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,480
Compulsive liar, petty theft.

624
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,600
<font color="#ffff00">'And the abuse?'</font>
Denied it. Said she'd lied.

625
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,600
<font color="#ffff00">Well, they would do.</font>

626
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,960
<font color="#ffff00">Could some kind of trouble</font>
<font color="#ffff00">have followed her to Newcastle?</font>

627
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,360
Well, let's do some digging,
but then...

628
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,400
if her family had already lost
one daughter,

629
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,120
wouldn't they go chasing after
the other one?

630
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,600
No matter how much
she'd been acting up?

631
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,360
<font color="#ffff00">'You think</font>
<font color="#ffff00">they're hiding something?'</font>

632
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,680
I'll see you back at the station.

633
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,080
<font color="#ffff00">Has she got more abrasive?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">The boss, I mean.</font>

634
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,640
<font color="#00ff00">Well, er...</font>

635
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,560
<font color="#00ff00">think it's more like your memories</font>
<font color="#00ff00">are rose-tinted, eh?</font>

636
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,680
<font color="#ffff00">Look, she's the best.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">We all know that. That's fine.</font>

637
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,520
<font color="#ffff00">But I'm ambitious. You know,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I want a team of my own one day.</font>

638
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,400
<font color="#ffff00">She makes us feel like</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I've just been demoted.</font>

639
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,920
HE CHORTLES

640
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,440
<font color="#00ff00">Join the club, mate.</font>

641
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,360
<font color="#00ff00">My advice is -</font>
<font color="#00ff00">don't take it personally.</font>

642
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,440
<font color="#ffff00">Well, perhaps we can jog</font>
<font color="#ffff00">your memory, Miss Adeyemi.</font>

643
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,640
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, Gabi?</font>

644
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,280
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, I know who you mean now.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">She's really dead?</font>

645
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,600
<font color="#00ff00">We're afraid so.</font>

646
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,960
<font color="#00ffff">But she seemed to be doing so well.</font>

647
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,720
<font color="#00ffff">Still in early treatment.</font>

648
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,560
<font color="#ffff00">You mean the chemo?</font>

649
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,280
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah. Well, did the lymphoma...?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Were there complications?</font>

650
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,600
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, the cancer didn't kill her.</font>

651
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,520
<font color="#ffff00">I mean we'd hardly be here</font>
<font color="#ffff00">if it had.</font>

652
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,520
<font color="#00ff00">We're treating her death</font>
<font color="#00ff00">as suspicious.</font>

653
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,760
<font color="#00ffff">What? What happened to her?</font>

654
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,760
<font color="#00ff00">That's what we're trying to</font>
<font color="#00ff00">find out.</font>

655
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,640
<font color="#ffff00">The one thing we did discover...</font>

656
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,560
<font color="#ffff00">is that Gabi</font>
<font color="#ffff00">didn't really have cancer.</font>

657
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,760
<font color="#00ffff">But...</font>

658
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,280
<font color="#00ffff">No, we'd talk about her symptoms.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Well, the side effects of her drugs.</font>

659
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,200
<font color="#00ff00">Did you help Gabi fabricate</font>
<font color="#00ff00">her condition?</font>

660
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,400
<font color="#00ffff">Of course not!</font>

661
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,000
<font color="#ffff00">So the contact you had with her</font>
<font color="#ffff00">was more accidental, then?</font>

662
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,440
<font color="#ffff00">A casual thing?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Yes.</font>

663
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,240
<font color="#00ffff">Look, I'm a bit in shock here</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to be honest.</font>

664
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,400
<font color="#00ffff">I'm sorry I can't be of more help.</font>

665
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,080
<font color="#00ffff">There's nothing else I can tell you.</font>

666
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,400
<font color="#ffff00">OK.</font>

667
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,560
<font color="#ffff00">Well, thanks for your time, anyway.</font>

668
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,120
<font color="#00ff00">Thank you.</font>

669
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,560
<font color="#00ffff">Ma'am.</font>
What's this? A welcoming committee?

670
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,600
In that case, someone get us a tea.

671
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,480
<font color="#00ffff">Ma'am? I've been working through</font>
<font color="#00ffff">all of Gabi's pay-as-you-go cards.</font>

672
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,920
And?<font color="#00ffff">The SIM that was in</font>
<font color="#00ffff">her hidden phone</font>

673
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,840
<font color="#00ffff">seems different to the others used</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for her con.</font>

674
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,880
<font color="#00ffff">It isn't labelled with any initials.</font>

675
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,720
<font color="#00ffff">But there was frequent calls</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to a number called "LC".</font>

676
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,600
So she was making regular calls
to somebody besides Helen?

677
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,520
So who is this LC?

678
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,120
<font color="#00ff00">Er, well, bear with us, ma'am,</font>

679
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,840
<font color="#00ff00">but I've been tracking</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Gabi backwards</font>

680
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,080
<font color="#00ff00">from when she got on the train.</font>

681
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:28,480
<font color="#00ff00">Er, now she's alone at the station.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">But then on the street CCTV outside,</font>

682
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,840
<font color="#00ff00">we've caught her arguing with</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a young male.</font>

683
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,440
What?
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, here's the footage.</font>

684
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,400
And this is who you think
she's been calling?

685
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,000
Why do you think that?

686
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,000
<font color="#00ffff">Because I traced</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the unknown phone number,</font>

687
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,800
<font color="#00ffff">and it's not a pay-as-you-go.</font>

688
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,560
<font color="#00ffff">It's a contract</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in the name of Lee Critchley.</font>

689
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,840
LC!

690
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,080
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, and he's on the radar</font>
<font color="#00ff00">for low-level drug dealing.</font>

691
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,320
Well, that sounds like our lad.
Well done, the pair of you!

692
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,800
Now cancel that tea.
Call Joe, give him that address.

693
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,280
Tell him to meet us there.

694
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,280
BOTH:<font color="#00ff00">Ma'am.</font>

695
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,680
SEAGULLS MEW

696
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,560
The hospital pharmacist?

697
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,840
<font color="#ffff00">Aye, Rosa Adeyemi. She seemed nervy.</font>

698
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,640
<font color="#ffff00">Kenny's gonna ask</font>
<font color="#ffff00">some discreet questions about her.</font>

699
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,280
You flavour of the month, then,
with Kenny again?

700
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,200
<font color="#ffff00">You what?</font>
Now you've stopped assessing us.

701
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,240
<font color="#ffff00">We'll run a background check on her,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">an' all.</font>

702
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,200
Did you ask this Rosa
about the ketamine Gabi had?

703
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,560
<font color="#ffff00">Why?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">You want some for your toothache?</font>

704
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,520
ASHWORTH KNOCKS ON DOOR

705
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,280
Hello, love.

706
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,800
Is Lee Critchley home?
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

707
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,960
Oh, it's a shame.

708
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,920
You family?
<font color="#00ffff">His girlfriend.</font>

709
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,240
Ah, quick chat, then?

710
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,400
Hey, no need to tidy up for us, pet.

711
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,840
We're not searching the place...
today.

712
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,560
<font color="#00ffff">Lee's not answering my messages.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Has something happened?</font>

713
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,880
<font color="#ffff00">We're here cos of Gabi Fischer.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Also known as Gabi McSwain.</font>

714
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,400
<font color="#00ffff">What about her?</font>

715
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,160
Well, she's dead, pet.
Killed three days ago.

716
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,280
<font color="#00ffff">What?</font>

717
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,560
<font color="#ffff00">And she was seen with Lee</font>
<font color="#ffff00">earlier the same day.</font>

718
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,760
<font color="#00ffff">Er...</font>

719
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,120
<font color="#00ffff">Gabi crashed here for a bit...</font>
<font color="#00ffff">months back.</font>

720
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,280
<font color="#00ffff">Lee knew her from where he grew up.</font>

721
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,280
So, she was what? A past girlfriend?

722
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,080
Hey, that wouldn't have been
very nice, love,

723
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,040
having his ex
sleeping in the spare room.

724
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:54,560
So, what? Did she start cosying up
to your boyfriend again?

725
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,960
<font color="#00ffff">Gabi would cosy up to anyone</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to get what she wanted.</font>

726
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,600
<font color="#ffff00">What does that mean?</font>

727
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,240
<font color="#00ffff">She outstayed her welcome.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I wanted her gone.</font>

728
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,120
<font color="#00ffff">Then suddenly, she was all over me.</font>

729
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,520
<font color="#00ffff">Telling me how amazing I am.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">How Lee's lucky to have us.</font>

730
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,400
<font color="#00ffff">And then I found text messages</font>
<font color="#00ffff">from her,</font>

731
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,920
<font color="#00ffff">calling me a "stupid bitch".</font>

732
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,600
So you were glad when she left?

733
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,960
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

734
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,320
<font color="#00ffff">But they were still in touch.</font>

735
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,840
<font color="#00ffff">I found a text from her last week.</font>

736
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,080
Do you go through his phone
regularly, do you?

737
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,760
<font color="#00ffff">I got angry...</font>

738
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,840
<font color="#00ffff">asked him about it, and...</font>
<font color="#00ffff">he was raging.</font>

739
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,800
<font color="#00ffff">But this was...</font>

740
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,680
<font color="#00ffff">It was more her he was angry with.</font>

741
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,480
He was angry at Gabi?

742
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,960
Why?

743
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,320
We've got a drug dealer,
a pharmacist,

744
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,720
and the deceased,

745
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,200
who was skilled at deception and
had a stash of prescription pills.

746
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,960
<font color="#ffff00">The ketamine - you think</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it's some kind of drug scam?</font>

747
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,560
Steph, get on to
the pharmacy manager.

748
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,800
See if they've got any concerns
over drug stock levels.<font color="#00ffff">Ma'am.</font>

749
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:15,360
And let's invite Miss Rosa Adeyemi
in for a little chat.

750
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:34,360
So, Rosa, after a brief audit,

751
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,280
the pharmacy manager at the hospital
expressed his concern

752
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,120
over the uptick in the prescription
of certain drugs.

753
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:46,560
<font color="#ffff00">Ketamine. Fentanyl. Morphine.</font>

754
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,400
Someone at the hospital
has been adapting prescriptions,

755
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,800
changing dosages, and filling in
scripts with fake names.

756
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,360
"Ghost patients"
created by someone else.

757
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,800
<font color="#ffff00">They'll trace it back to you, Rosa.</font>

758
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,480
<font color="#ffff00">So, come on. Tell us how</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you really knew Gabi Fischer?</font>

759
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,200
OK. I'll tell you
how I think this scam works.

760
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,360
You give drugs to Gabi Fischer.

761
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,600
She gives them to Lee Critchley,
and he sells them on.

762
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,920
Am I right?

763
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,680
<font color="#ffff00">Because fraud is one thing.</font>

764
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,800
<font color="#ffff00">But you need to convince us</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you weren't part of her murder.</font>

765
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,680
<font color="#00ffff">What?!</font>

766
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,920
<font color="#00ffff">No!</font>

767
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,800
<font color="#00ffff">I only got involved to...</font>

768
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,840
To what?

769
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,760
<font color="#00ffff">My dad.</font>

770
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,800
<font color="#00ffff">He had an accident last year.</font>

771
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,720
I'm sorry to hear that.

772
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,760
<font color="#00ffff">He got addicted</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to prescription pain meds.</font>

773
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,120
<font color="#00ffff">Wanted me to help him get them.</font>

774
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,960
<font color="#00ffff">But because I'm a pharmacist,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">he thought I could just help myself.</font>

775
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,360
<font color="#00ffff">But I told him that I couldn't.</font>

776
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,000
Oh, you just let him suffer?

777
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,200
<font color="#00ffff">No, he found himself some dealer.</font>

778
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,400
<font color="#ffff00">Lee Critchley.</font>

779
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,760
<font color="#00ffff">You need to talk to him.</font>

780
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,440
<font color="#00ffff">I never wanted to do anything wrong.</font>

781
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,200
Ah, they all say that, pet!

782
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,760
<font color="#00ffff">But now Dad was on a hook.</font>

783
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,480
<font color="#00ffff">And when he couldn't afford more,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">he told Lee what my job was.</font>

784
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,520
<font color="#ffff00">And he put you and Gabi together.</font>

785
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,560
<font color="#00ffff">But I had nothing to do with</font>
<font color="#00ffff">her death.</font>

786
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,040
<font color="#00ffff">You have to believe me.</font>

787
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,720
Well, that fraud charge'll stick,
but she's right.

788
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,560
We need to find Lee Critchley.
<font color="#ffff00">You think he's done a runner?</font>

789
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,840
<font color="#00ff00">Er, ma'am?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I thought you'd wanna know.</font>

790
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,920
<font color="#00ff00">Fiona Rushden's back in the UK.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">We've got an address for her.</font>

791
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,600
Right.
<font color="#ffff00">Last Rushden to talk to.</font>

792
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,000
Aye.<font color="#ffff00">Put out a wider search</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for Lee Critchley</font>

793
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,200
<font color="#ffff00">and let us know as soon as</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you've got something.</font> <font color="#00ff00">Sir.</font>

794
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,880
FIONA:<font color="#00ffff">I've not spoken to Gabi</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in months.</font>

795
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,880
<font color="#ffff00">Why? Were you avoiding her?</font>

796
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,120
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, no. I'd no issues with her.</font>

797
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,000
What, really? Not even
when she moved in with your mam?

798
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,920
Into your old room?
<font color="#00ffff">It was between the two of them.</font>

799
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,760
See, some daughters would've
questioned the time and money spent.

800
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,200
Resented it, even.

801
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:09,440
<font color="#00ffff">Mum has pretty firm views</font>
<font color="#00ffff">on us kids striving for ourselves.</font>

802
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,160
<font color="#00ffff">And I'm doing all right.</font>

803
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,840
Oh, I can see that, pet.

804
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,680
<font color="#ffff00">What about Gabi splitting up</font>
<font color="#ffff00">your parents' marriage?</font>

805
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,600
<font color="#00ffff">Who said she did that?</font>

806
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,760
<font color="#00ffff">Jonathon? Dad?</font>

807
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,880
<font color="#00ffff">They were struggling</font>
<font color="#00ffff">long before Gabi arrived.</font>

808
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:33,160
<font color="#00ffff">Look, what she did was terrible,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">deceiving everyone.</font>

809
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,480
<font color="#00ffff">But it makes sense, I suppose,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">as a way to keep Mam's attention.</font>

810
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,760
Have you been to see your mam
since you flew back?

811
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,080
<font color="#00ffff">No. Why?</font>
Why?!

812
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,280
Because of what
she's been going through.

813
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,800
Grieving this lass

814
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,160
and then discovering
she's been conned.

815
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,320
<font color="#00ffff">You're right. I should go see her.</font>

816
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,280
Now, we're sorry
we dragged you back, pet,

817
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,200
from Spain, was it?
<font color="#00ffff">Yes.</font>

818
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,080
<font color="#ffff00">You've been abroad quite a few times</font>
<font color="#ffff00">this last year.</font>

819
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,760
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah. Work mostly.</font>

820
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,200
<font color="#ffff00">And you're with that big law firm.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">William and Beck, right?</font>

821
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,880
<font color="#00ffff">I did an internship there,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">but I'm starting as a trainee now.</font>

822
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,080
Oh, congratulations.

823
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,520
<font color="#ffff00">She's definitely hiding something.</font>
Of course she is!

824
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:27,880
I mean, where's she getting
money from if not from her mam? Hmm?

825
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,920
Those clothes and that flat
aren't cheap,

826
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,120
and her only out of uni last year.

827
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,000
<font color="#ffff00">I'll get Steph to look into</font>
<font color="#ffff00">her finances, the trips abroad.</font>

828
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,280
PHONE BUZZES

829
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,320
<font color="#ffff00">Mark, what's up?</font>

830
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,560
<font color="#00ff00">'Er, Joe, Helen Rushden's reported</font>
<font color="#00ff00">an intruder.'</font>

831
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,200
<font color="#ffff00">You what? When?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">'Now.'</font>

832
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,360
<font color="#ffff00">All right, we'll meet you there.</font>

833
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,480
<font color="#ffff00">Helen Rushden's just reported</font>
<font color="#ffff00">an intruder in her house.</font>

834
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,080
<font color="#ffff00">Are you receiving? Please respond.</font>

835
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:56,000
<font color="#00ff00">He could be stealing anything!</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Look, it's under control.</font> <font color="#00ff00">Right.</font>

836
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,240
Mrs Rushden?
STEPH:<font color="#00ffff">Do you copy? Please respond.</font>

837
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,080
<font color="#00ff00">You've gotta let me in!</font>
What's happened?<font color="#00ff00">Well, I...</font>

838
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,840
<font color="#00ff00">There's a broken pane in the door</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and someone going up the stairs.</font>

839
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,280
<font color="#ffff00">Intruder's still inside.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">He's trapped in a bedroom!</font>

840
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,600
Is he armed?
<font color="#00ffff">Don't think so.</font>

841
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,200
<font color="#00ffff">Mark's in there trying to</font>
<font color="#00ffff">talk him out.</font> He's what?!

842
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,120
<font color="#ffff00">Vera?! You can't go in there!</font>

843
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,160
Well, you're not actually
in charge here, Joe,

844
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,960
as much as you like to think
you are!

845
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,520
<font color="#ffff00">It's not safe to do so.</font>

846
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,000
<font color="#00ff00">Back garden!</font>
<font color="#00ff00">We've no officers there!</font>

847
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,120
<font color="#ffff00">Better come down now, Lee.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I can't! I'm stuck!</font>

848
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,200
<font color="#00ffff">Lee Critchley, ma'am.</font>
Oh, give me strength.

849
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,360
<font color="#00ff00">My trousers are caught!</font>

850
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,640
So, which one of you
wants to arrest him

851
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,120
when he's at ground level?

852
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,720
<font color="#00ff00">Help! Get me down!</font>
TROUSERS TEARING

853
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,240
VERA CHUCKLES

854
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:02,680
Well, breaking into that house
wasn't very smart, was it, Lee?

855
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,880
<font color="#ffff00">Not to mention getting stuck.</font>

856
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,280
Were you worried about
what Gabi might have left behind.

857
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,280
<font color="#00ff00">Don't know</font>
<font color="#00ff00">what you're talking about.</font>

858
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,160
Oh! An opportunistic break-in,
was it?

859
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,360
<font color="#ffff00">Cos it seems more likely</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that you were watching the house,</font>

860
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,840
<font color="#ffff00">waiting for her to go out,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and you thought you had time.</font>

861
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,400
This what you were after?

862
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,800
Or maybe
you were worried about these.

863
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:34,520
And we know you were in
regular contact with Gabi Fischer.

864
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:40,160
<font color="#00ff00">Who?</font>
Oh, Gabi McSwain.

865
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,880
Ah, come on, Lee.

866
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,160
We know she'd been kipping
in your spare room,

867
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,600
and we know about the scam

868
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,080
between you and Gabi
and that pharmacist.

869
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,360
<font color="#ffff00">You didn't even have a burner phone</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to hide your tracks.</font>

870
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,680
<font color="#ffff00">It's a bit of a schoolboy error.</font>

871
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:57,920
Plus, we have you both on CCTV
at the train station

872
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,240
on the day she died.

873
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,080
So, did you follow her, Lee?

874
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,760
Did you hurt her?
<font color="#00ff00">No!</font>

875
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,440
<font color="#ffff00">What were you arguing about?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">About her wanting to stop.</font>

876
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,760
Stop what?

877
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,040
<font color="#00ff00">She didn't need all that any more</font>
<font color="#00ff00">cos she was conning that woman.</font>

878
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,520
Oh, so you knew she was conning her?
<font color="#00ff00">Yes.</font>

879
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,120
<font color="#00ff00">But deep down,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">it wasn't about scamming money.</font>

880
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,520
SHE SCOFFS

881
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,440
<font color="#00ff00">Gabi had this gap.</font>

882
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,240
<font color="#00ff00">She wanted to be looked after.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Be adored.</font>

883
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,760
<font color="#00ff00">You know about her sister?</font>

884
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,440
Aye.

885
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,640
So, when Gabi left home,
she came looking for you, did she?

886
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,840
<font color="#ffff00">When she needed to pay her way,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">is that it?</font>

887
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,080
<font color="#00ff00">You think I pushed her</font>
<font color="#00ff00">into all this?</font>

888
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:44,160
<font color="#00ff00">Listen, I was fine.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">She's the one that needed cash.</font>

889
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,560
<font color="#00ff00">Started suggesting things</font>

890
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,600
<font color="#00ff00">like signing up</font>
<font color="#00ff00">at different doctor's surgeries.</font>

891
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,120
Oh, so you just helped her, did you?
Well, that's very noble.

892
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:54,520
Not so noble with Rosa, though,
were you?

893
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,720
Keeping her dad on a hook.

894
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,360
<font color="#ffff00">Did Rosa know</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Gabi was faking cancer?</font> <font color="#00ff00">No.</font>

895
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,720
<font color="#00ff00">Gabi found it funny. Rosa bought it.</font>

896
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,800
<font color="#00ff00">I think it gave her the idea to pull</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the same trick on that woman.</font>

897
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,160
<font color="#ffff00">So you lost her to Helen Rushden.</font>

898
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,480
<font color="#00ff00">First, she wants to ditch me</font>
<font color="#00ff00">after everything.</font>

899
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,800
<font color="#00ff00">Then she's accusing me of</font>
<font color="#00ff00">ruining things with the family.</font>

900
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,520
What's that supposed to mean?
<font color="#00ff00">She said I'd told 'em something.</font>

901
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,920
And had you?
<font color="#00ff00">No.</font>

902
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,280
<font color="#00ff00">I thought what she was doing</font>
<font color="#00ff00">was stupid, but I never told.</font>

903
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,120
So who was it who blabbed?

904
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,280
<font color="#ffff00">Come on, Lee! Someone killed Gabi,</font>

905
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,280
<font color="#ffff00">and you're saying</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you had nothing to do with it.</font>

906
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,040
<font color="#00ff00">Course I didn't! But I don't...</font>

907
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,760
<font color="#00ff00">You don't what?</font>

908
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:38,120
<font color="#00ff00">She hated the daughter.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I know that.</font>

909
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,640
<font color="#00ff00">She had a big fight with her.</font>

910
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,440
With Fiona?

911
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,200
<font color="#ffff00">We should hold him</font>

912
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,400
<font color="#ffff00">and check his movements</font>
<font color="#ffff00">after Gabi left Newcastle.</font>

913
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,920
Yeah, right now,
I'm more interested in Fiona.

914
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,160
She told us she's had no contact
with Gabi for months.

915
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,840
Steph, did you check
Fiona Rushden's alibi?

916
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,640
<font color="#00ffff">I've been on her finances.</font>
Well, check it!

917
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,480
<font color="#00ffff">Right, well, there was definitely</font>
<font color="#00ffff">recent contact between her and Gabi.</font>

918
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,520
What sort of contact?

919
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,280
<font color="#00ffff">An email to Fiona from</font>
<font color="#00ffff">one of the accounts Gabi set up.</font>

920
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,960
<font color="#ffff00">Go on.</font>

921
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,720
<font color="#00ffff">Well, as a message, it's weird.</font>

922
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,880
<font color="#00ffff">Just an attachment.</font>

923
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,760
<font color="#ffff00">Did Gabi take that?</font>

924
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,080
<font color="#00ffff">Looks like it's been cropped</font>
<font color="#00ffff">from somewhere. Social media?</font>

925
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,440
<font color="#00ffff">Fiona's got several feeds,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">but I haven't found a match yet.</font>

926
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,080
Now, why would she send that?
<font color="#00ffff">Exactly.</font>

927
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,880
<font color="#00ffff">Looks like it's supposed to be</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a message in itself.</font>

928
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,920
So, tell us about her finances?

929
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,920
<font color="#00ffff">Well, Fiona didn't pay</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for those overseas trips on her own.</font>

930
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,720
<font color="#00ffff">See these payments into her account?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Well, they coincide with the trips,</font>

931
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,840
<font color="#00ffff">but there's more than enough</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to cover travel and accommodation.</font>

932
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,400
Who's been making these payments?

933
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,120
<font color="#00ffff">I'm still tracing the account,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">ma'am.</font>

934
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,280
<font color="#00ff00">Er, ma'am? It's the morgue.</font>

935
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,760
<font color="#00ff00">Deborah and Matthew McSwain</font>
<font color="#00ff00">have just turned up.</font>

936
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,480
<font color="#00ff00">They want to view the body.</font>

937
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,920
SHE PANTS

938
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,680
SHE SOBS

939
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,920
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you... for allowing us...</font>
Ah.

940
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,560
It's good for us to get
a formal identification at last.

941
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,440
<font color="#00ffff">If we hadn't let her go, maybe...</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Hey, hey, no.</font>

942
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,960
Look, I'm sorry, love.

943
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,480
You told us that Gabi had been
involved in petty crime.

944
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,840
<font color="#00ff00">After her sister got sick, yeah.</font>

945
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,520
Now, it's just that
she has been involved

946
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,480
in illegally obtaining
and distributing drugs.

947
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,840
<font color="#00ffff">Drugs?!</font>
<font color="#00ff00">No!</font>

948
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,240
<font color="#00ff00">No, there was...</font>
<font color="#00ff00">There was nothing like that.</font>

949
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,920
<font color="#00ff00">Look, I'm sorry could...</font>
<font color="#00ff00">could you excuse us?</font>

950
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,000
Imagine having to bury
a second daughter.

951
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,320
Blaming themselves for it, too.

952
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,200
<font color="#ffff00">Did you ask them</font>
<font color="#ffff00">why they didn't search for her?</font>

953
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,600
Well, they'd already told us,
hadn't they?

954
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,440
She was trouble.
They were glad when she left.

955
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,160
<font color="#00ff00">So, I've got this mate.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">He's a local cop out in Berwick.</font>

956
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,920
<font color="#00ff00">Thought it was worth</font>
<font color="#00ff00">giving him a call.</font>

957
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,920
<font color="#00ff00">Had quite a story as well.</font>

958
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,880
Well, let's hear it!

959
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,200
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, so, Gabi's mam</font>
<font color="#00ff00">used to help out</font>

960
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,720
<font color="#00ff00">with the daughter of a friend.</font>

961
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,000
<font color="#00ff00">Pick her up from school.</font>

962
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,200
<font color="#00ff00">Gave her tea some nights,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">that sort of thing.</font>

963
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,240
<font color="#00ff00">Anyway, anonymous call</font>
<font color="#00ff00">come into the police</font>

964
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,080
<font color="#00ff00">saying that Deborah</font>
<font color="#00ff00">was hurting the child.</font>

965
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,560
Yeah, but we checked.

966
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,800
There was no record
of her being charged.<font color="#00ff00">Er, no, ma'am.</font>

967
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,000
<font color="#00ff00">Police had to look into it,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">obviously...</font>

968
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:00,000
So the case was dismissed?
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah. No evidence at all.</font>

969
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,760
<font color="#00ff00">The girl had been playing</font>
<font color="#00ff00">in the playground and fell</font>

970
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,560
<font color="#00ff00">just before the tip off come in.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">She gashed her arm.</font>

971
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,440
<font color="#00ff00">Was total accident.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Plenty of witnesses around.</font>

972
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,200
So, hang on, are you saying
this anonymous caller was Gabi?

973
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,400
<font color="#00ff00">Well, it was never confirmed,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and she disappeared straight after.</font>

974
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,200
<font color="#00ff00">But her parents thought so.</font>

975
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:20,320
<font color="#ffff00">Maliciously accused her own mother</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and then scarpered.</font>

976
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,360
No wonder they didn't go
looking for her.

977
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,520
<font color="#00ffff">OK. Thanks.</font>

978
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,760
<font color="#00ffff">The payments into Fiona's account</font>
<font color="#00ffff">came from a Jonah Green.</font>

979
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,960
And who's Jonah Green?

980
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,520
<font color="#00ffff">A senior partner</font>
<font color="#00ffff">at William and Beck.</font>

981
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,440
What? The firm Fiona works for?

982
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,600
The pace too slow for you
now you're back in Newcastle?

983
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,640
<font color="#ffff00">I was up late. Sorting stuff out.</font>

984
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:53,760
What? Unpacking crockery?
Connecting the Wi-Fi?<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

985
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,480
<font color="#ffff00">Although you wouldn't be joking</font>
<font color="#ffff00">if you'd just uprooted teenagers</font>

986
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,360
<font color="#ffff00">to a new city</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and hadn't sorted the Wi-Fi.</font>

987
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,560
Oh.

988
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,880
This your dad?
<font color="#ffff00">Aye.</font>

989
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,040
<font color="#ffff00">We should really move him</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to a hospice, but it just feels...</font>

990
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,800
<font color="#00ff00">Excuse me? Sorry to keep you.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Mr Green has made himself available.</font>

991
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,160
Oh, has he?
That's very nice of him.

992
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,160
MUTTERING: She's had a charm bypass.

993
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,440
<font color="#00ffff">I helped Fiona get her internship.</font>

994
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,000
<font color="#00ffff">I'm pleased she's now a trainee.</font>

995
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,960
Mm. So, why have you been
giving her money, love?

996
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,680
<font color="#00ffff">Er... well, that's... private.</font>

997
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,160
Oh, I wouldn't go poking into
private matters if I didn't have to.

998
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,760
But this is a murder investigation.

999
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,720
<font color="#00ffff">And I don't see the connection.</font>

1000
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,520
Because she was coy
about her trips abroad,

1001
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,680
and now you're hiding
why you were sending her money,

1002
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,560
which makes me curious.

1003
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,880
<font color="#00ffff">Sounds like gossipy nosiness,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">not serious evidence gathering.</font>

1004
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:58,040
Sounds like you'd rather come down
to the station to talk.

1005
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,280
<font color="#ffff00">Ah, come on.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">There's no need for that, is there?</font>

1006
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,480
<font color="#ffff00">We can deal with this nice and easy.</font>

1007
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,200
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe at Mr Green's home?</font>

1008
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,640
MR GREEN SCOFFS
<font color="#00ffff">All right. Look...</font>

1009
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,200
<font color="#00ffff">There's an arrangement</font>
<font color="#00ffff">between Fiona and I, OK?</font>

1010
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,520
<font color="#00ffff">All above board.</font>
An "arrangement"?

1011
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,160
<font color="#00ffff">Made via a website.</font>

1012
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,160
This is like getting blood
from a stone!

1013
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,400
Show us the website, and we're gone.

1014
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,400
What is this?

1015
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,120
<font color="#ffff00">It's a sugaring site.</font>

1016
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,840
<font color="#ffff00">It's where young women</font>
<font color="#ffff00">can advertise themselves</font>

1017
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,240
<font color="#ffff00">to spend time with richer,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">usually older, men.</font>

1018
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,040
I see.

1019
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:54,000
And that's the photo Gabi sent.

1020
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,160
<font color="#ffff00">If she cropped it from that site,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">she knew Fiona was sugaring.</font>

1021
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,040
Aye, and I wonder
how Fiona felt about that?

1022
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,520
I want her brought in
for questioning... today!

1023
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,440
<font color="#00ffff">Men want one thing.</font>

1024
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:11,080
<font color="#00ffff">This is quid pro quo...</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to get what I want.</font>

1025
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,720
Oh, aye? And what's that, love?

1026
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,800
<font color="#00ffff">Some professional advice.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Some money to offset my debts.</font>

1027
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,480
Hmm. Plus a few luxury trips?

1028
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,960
<font color="#00ffff">Everything's agreed.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Everyone is willing.</font>

1029
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,120
<font color="#00ffff">There's no Me Too here.</font>

1030
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,000
Now, I'm not judging, love.
<font color="#00ffff">Really?</font>

1031
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,000
But I'm guessing...

1032
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,400
none of your colleagues
know about this.

1033
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,920
Or your mam.

1034
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,480
<font color="#00ffff">I saw what happened</font>
<font color="#00ffff">when my brother asked for money.</font>

1035
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,640
<font color="#ffff00">Jonathon? What happened?</font>

1036
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,720
<font color="#00ffff">He crashed and burned.</font>

1037
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,920
So, if your mam's money tap is off,
well, it must have been hard

1038
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,440
seeing her give Gabi
everything she wanted?

1039
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,440
<font color="#00ffff">I said I didn't care about Gabi.</font>

1040
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,000
<font color="#ffff00">You also said you hadn't had</font>
<font color="#ffff00">any contact at all.</font>

1041
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:02,960
<font color="#ffff00">But that's not true, is it?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Because Gabi sent you that photo.</font>

1042
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,000
Cos she found out about
your sugaring.

1043
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:12,600
<font color="#00ffff">I'd considered going back home, OK?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">About a month or so back.</font>

1044
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,120
<font color="#00ffff">But Gabi was well settled.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Didn't want me ruining it.</font>

1045
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,280
<font color="#ffff00">So what was the picture? A threat?</font>

1046
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,120
<font color="#00ffff">"Stay away or I tell."</font>

1047
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,040
<font color="#00ffff">She wanted my mum to herself.</font>

1048
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,640
Well, that must have been terrible.

1049
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,720
<font color="#00ffff">God, do you wanna hear,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">"I hated her"?</font>

1050
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,520
Well, didn't you?

1051
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,680
<font color="#00ffff">Even if I did,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">it doesn't mean I'd hurt her.</font>

1052
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,960
<font color="#00ffff">That's what you're supposed</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to be finding out. Right?</font>

1053
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:42,280
Steph, how you doing
with Fiona's alibi?

1054
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,160
<font color="#00ffff">Checks out, ma'am. She was at work.</font>

1055
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,200
<font color="#00ffff">Plenty of witnesses.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Flew to Spain that evening.</font>

1056
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,040
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, and by the way,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">we can also place her dad.</font>

1057
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,240
<font color="#ffff00">Tom?</font> <font color="#00ffff">Mark spoke to a mechanic</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in his garage.</font>

1058
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,760
<font color="#00ffff">They can vouch for him till five,</font>

1059
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,960
<font color="#00ffff">but they also suggested</font>
<font color="#00ffff">he'd more than likely</font>

1060
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,160
<font color="#00ffff">go to The Griffin for a few</font>
<font color="#00ffff">before heading off.</font> Aye.

1061
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,960
<font color="#ffff00">So, he went to the pub</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and then the garage?</font>

1062
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,680
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, eyewitnesses and CCTV.</font>

1063
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,080
OK, Steph.
Carry on with the family's finances.

1064
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,640
Now, Fiona said her brother
asked Helen for money.

1065
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,720
I wonder what he wanted that for?

1066
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,040
PHONE BUZZES
<font color="#ffff00">Speak of the devil.</font>

1067
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,600
<font color="#ffff00">DI Ashworth.</font>

1068
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,440
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry, you were with your mother,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and who turned up?</font>

1069
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,080
<font color="#00ff00">Mum has asked you to go.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I didn't mean...</font>

1070
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:28,120
<font color="#00ffff">I just wanted...</font>
<font color="#00ff00">You need to leave. Now.</font>

1071
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,960
<font color="#00ffff">Just... she used lived here,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">my girl, with her.</font>

1072
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,120
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah. And I wish she hadn't.</font>

1073
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:36,320
<font color="#00ff00">I wish I'd never met your daughter.</font>

1074
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,320
<font color="#00ff00">Wanna know what it was like</font>
<font color="#00ff00">looking after her?</font>

1075

<font color="#00ff00">I can't tell you!</font>

1076
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,200
<font color="#00ff00">Cos it was all lies!</font>

1077
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:44,840
<font color="#00ff00">Your daughter was nothing but</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a manipulative, deceitful...</font>

1078
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,440
<font color="#ffff00">All right. Let's leave it.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">You produced nothing but a monster!</font>

1079
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,840
<font color="#00ff00">Get her out of my house!</font>
Come on, pet, it's time to go.

1080
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,160
Come on.

1081
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:55,080
<font color="#00ffff">I just... I just need a minute.</font>

1082
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,840
Get her a cup of tea. Sweet one.

1083
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,240
All right, I'll go.

1084
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,800
Can you give us a fiver?
<font color="#ffff00">I'll get it.</font>

1085
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,760
<font color="#00ff00">Matthew's coming.</font>

1086
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,520
<font color="#00ff00">His boat's in for an overhaul,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">anyway.</font>

1087
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,880
CASHIER:<font color="#00ffff">What can I get you?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Cup of tea, please.</font>

1088
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,360
Did he know you've been to see
Helen?<font color="#00ff00">No.</font>

1089
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,840
<font color="#00ff00">Didn't even wanna come yesterday</font>
<font color="#00ff00">to see...</font>

1090
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,280
<font color="#00ff00">..Gabi.</font>

1091
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,320
<font color="#00ff00">He'll be appalled.</font>

1092
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,280
Why did you go, love?

1093
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,080
<font color="#00ff00">That woman was doing something</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I should have been.</font>

1094
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,400
<font color="#00ff00">Looking after her.</font>

1095
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,120
<font color="#00ff00">Was she right?</font>

1096
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,640
<font color="#00ff00">About me raising a monster?</font>

1097
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,800
Oh, listen love.

1098
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:00,720
Your mam and dad always mess you up
one way or another.

1099
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,320
But kids become adults

1100
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,520
and take responsibility
for their actions.

1101
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,360
You're not to blame
for what Gabi did.

1102
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,720
You're not.

1103
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,360
<font color="#ffff00">Cup of tea for you.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Thanks.</font>

1104
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,680
<font color="#00ff00">He's here.</font>

1105
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,600
<font color="#00ffff">You all right?</font>

1106
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,240
<font color="#00ffff">Come here.</font>

1107
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,200
<font color="#00ffff">Hey.</font>

1108
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,360
<font color="#00ff00">I'm sorry.</font>

1109
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,800
<font color="#00ffff">OK.</font>

1110
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,000
Mr McSwain,
can I have a quick word?

1111
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,320
Now, just before Gabi left home,

1112
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:56,040
there was an accusation of abuse
levelled at your wife.

1113
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:01,640
<font color="#00ff00">She was exonerated... completely.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">We know.</font>

1114
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,840
<font color="#ffff00">But was that the reason</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you never looked for Gabi?</font>

1115
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,000
<font color="#00ff00">Even being accused...</font>

1116
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,400
<font color="#00ff00">investigated...</font>

1117
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,760
<font color="#00ff00">people heard.</font>

1118
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:16,440
<font color="#00ff00">Started looking at her differently.</font>

1119
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,720
<font color="#00ff00">Still do.</font>

1120
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,240
<font color="#00ff00">And the shame that that brought...</font>

1121
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,640
<font color="#00ff00">Debs needed time.</font>

1122
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,680
And you?
<font color="#00ff00">I, er...</font>

1123
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,560
<font color="#00ff00">I hoped we could find Gabi one day.</font>

1124
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,240
<font color="#00ff00">If nothing else, I wanted to try</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and understand how she could...</font>

1125
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,160
<font color="#00ff00">Anyway.</font>

1126
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,480
<font color="#00ff00">Won't happen now, will it?</font>

1127
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:48,440
<font color="#ffff00">Steph?</font> <font color="#00ffff">'Helen's company.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I've been looking at the accounts,</font>

1129
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,040
<font color="#00ffff">But I think</font>
<font color="#00ffff">he's been mismanaging it.</font>

1130
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:54,240
<font color="#ffff00">'What do you mean?'</font>

1131
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,480
<font color="#00ffff">Well, he's been funnelling money</font>
<font color="#00ffff">from the coffee shops</font>

<font color="#00ffff">But it's sinking.</font>

1134
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,240
<font color="#00ff00">Is that the boss?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

1135
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,720
<font color="#00ffff">Hold on, ma'am. Mark wants you.</font>

1136
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,720
Right, go on, Mark?
<font color="#00ff00">'Ma'am.</font>

<font color="#00ff00">all day last Wednesday.</font>

1140
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:19,160
Now, why would a wife
go and do that... hmm?

1141
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,520
<font color="#ffff00">Go on, Mark...</font>

1142
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:25,600
Now, come on.
What's this all about, love?

1143
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,320
You see,
by withdrawing your statement,

1144
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,800
what you're really saying is

1145
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,000
that you lied to us
the first time round.

1146

<font color="#00ffff">I'm sorry about that.</font>

1147
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,880
Hmm? So why do it?

<font color="#ffff00">happened last Wednesday?</font>

1150
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,720
<font color="#00ffff">Jonathon worked from home.</font>

1151
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,600
<font color="#00ffff">Then he went out. A bit after four.</font>

1152

<font color="#ffff00">Where did he go?</font>

1156
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,720
<font color="#00ffff">Ask him!</font>

1157
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:00,520
So, he was doing something,
but you don't want to tell us what?

1158
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,720
<font color="#00ffff">Why should I tell you</font>
<font color="#00ffff">his dirty secrets?</font>

1159
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,880
<font color="#00ffff">He can tell you himself!</font>

Where is he love?

Let's go to the pub.

1162
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,320
<font color="#00ff00">Liar! How could you!</font>

1163
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:17,415
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
What's all this about?

1164
01:06:17,455 --> 01:06:18,955
<font color="#00ffff">He said come by,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">then started laying into us!</font>

1165
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:21,480
<font color="#00ff00">Because I know the truth!</font>

1166
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,920
What "truth"?

1167
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,680
<font color="#00ff00">He knew Gabi was a fraud all along!</font>

1168
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,600
<font color="#00ff00">And he didn't tell us!</font>

1169
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:31,000
<font color="#00ff00">Not Helen. Not me. No-one!</font>

1170
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:32,640
<font color="#00ffff">He doesn't know</font>
<font color="#00ffff">what he's saying, man.</font>

1171
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,480
<font color="#00ff00">And you want to know</font>
<font color="#00ff00">why he kept quiet?</font>

1172
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,040
<font color="#00ff00">Do you want to know why?</font>

1173
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,960
<font color="#00ff00">Because he was sleeping with her!</font>

1174
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,880
He was sleeping... with Gabi?

1175
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:48,840
Thanks, love.

1176
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:58,120
Are you really saying
he knew Gabi was faking cancer?

1177
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,720
And he was sleeping with her?

1178
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,600
<font color="#00ff00">Yes. Freya told me.</font>

1179
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,720
How'd she know?

1180
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,680
<font color="#00ff00">She's his wife.</font>

1181
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,440
<font color="#00ff00">She was sorry I'd lost mine.</font>

1182
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,320
Hold that.

1183
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:26,000
<font color="#ffff00">How's he doing?</font>
Uniform are gonna see him home.

1184
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,600
And what about this one?

1185
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,800
<font color="#ffff00">He'll live.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">What's happening?</font>

1186
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,400
Thanks, pet.
<font color="#00ff00">Thanks, ma'am.</font>

1187
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,200
<font color="#00ffff">Can I go yet?</font>
Ah, well, that depends.

1188
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,400
And what's your version of all this?

1189
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:40,240
<font color="#00ffff">Well, you saw Dad.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">He's drunk. He was lashing out.</font>

1190
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:44,480
He said it was your missus
told him about you and Gabi.

1191
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,400
<font color="#00ffff">Things have been difficult</font>
<font color="#00ffff">between me and Freya.</font>

1192
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,600
<font color="#00ffff">Money worries.</font>
Really?

1193
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,520
<font color="#00ffff">If she's got hold of</font>
<font color="#00ffff">some nonsense idea...</font>

1194
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:55,720
<font color="#00ffff">doesn't make it true.</font>

1195
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,600
<font color="#ffff00">So, you weren't sleeping</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with Gabi, then?</font> <font color="#00ffff">Course not.</font>

1196
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,200
<font color="#ffff00">Just cos if you were,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, you'd want it kept quiet.</font>

1197
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,480
<font color="#ffff00">You'd want her to keep it quiet.</font>

1198
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,040
<font color="#00ffff">Are you serious?</font>

1199
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:10,080
<font color="#00ffff">Throwing accusations at me when</font>
<font color="#00ffff">my dad's the one punching people?!</font>

1200
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,480
<font color="#00ffff">Why not look at him, eh?</font>

1201
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,680
Because he hasn't just lost
his alibi

1202
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,440
for the day Gabi died, pet.

1203
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,160
But we will bear in mind
that you think

1204
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:22,280
your own father should be considered
as a murder suspect.

1205
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,520
Shall we?

1206
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,760
<font color="#ffff00">I'll gather anything</font>
<font color="#ffff00">we've got on her</font>

1207
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,200
<font color="#ffff00">and run his car plates</font>
<font color="#ffff00">from last Wednesday.</font>

1208
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,880
<font color="#ffff00">Cell site data, too.</font>

1209
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,120
I want him and his missus
brought in for questioning

1210
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,680
first thing in the morning.

1211
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,720
<font color="#ffff00">Jonathon's ready, and I've got Freya</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in the other interview room.</font>

1212
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,520
Anything on her?

1213
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:57,040
<font color="#ffff00">No, squeaky clean</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and fully co-operative today.</font>

1214
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,240
<font color="#ffff00">Volunteered access to her phone</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and everything.</font>

1215
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:03,080
Right.
Joe, have you got any painkillers?

1216
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,560
<font color="#ffff00">Have you not booked the dentist yet?</font>

1217
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,480
Well, I'm trying to solve
a murder here,

1218
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,800
in case you hadn't noticed.

1219
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,720
<font color="#ffff00">There's some in my desk.</font>

1220
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,680
<font color="#00ffff">Sir?</font>

1221
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,920
<font color="#00ffff">Any chance I could sit in</font>
<font color="#00ffff">if you're interviewing Freya?</font>

1222
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,160
<font color="#00ffff">It's just I haven't yet... with her.</font>

1223
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,800
<font color="#ffff00">How long you been here now?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Four months.</font>

1224
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,560
Well, then, it's about time,
isn't it?

1225
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,080
Sure. Get ready.

1226
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,280
<font color="#ffff00">What are you doing?</font>

1227
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,840
You were so busy chatting,
I thought I'd get 'em myself.

1228
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:36,400
<font color="#ffff00">So, Jonathon says</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you're upset and confused</font>

1229
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,040
<font color="#ffff00">and you're angry about money.</font>

1230
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:42,760
<font color="#00ff00">No, that's not what's happening.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I know his business is going badly.</font>

1231
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,320
<font color="#00ff00">He talked about remortgaging</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the house, for God's sake.</font>

1232
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:48,960
<font color="#00ffff">So you ARE anxious about money?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">It's totally natural.</font>

1233
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,840
<font color="#ffff00">Worried about yourself, your son.</font>

1234
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,760
<font color="#00ff00">Fine. Yeah, OK?</font>

1235
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,960
<font color="#00ff00">But that's nothing to do with</font>
<font color="#00ff00">what I told Tom.</font>

1236
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,720
<font color="#00ffff">I'm sorting the finances.</font>

1237
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,880
<font color="#00ffff">It's not serious.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Freya just worries.</font>

1238
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,480
Well, it's serious enough

1239
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,760
to syphon money away
from your mam's business.

1240
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,160
Here... here... here.

1241
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,200
<font color="#00ffff">How we run our company</font>
<font color="#00ffff">is a matter for my ma and me.</font>

1242
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:15,800
Except I'd lay good money
she's no idea about any of this.

1243
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,200
Taking money from her shops
to feed a failing side project?

1244
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,000
Not her style, love.

1245
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,920
And claiming your wife's hysterical
won't wash with me, pet.

1246
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:29,800
So, why don't we have an honest talk

1247
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,120
about you and Gabi.

1248
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:37,360
<font color="#ffff00">How did you find out that Jonathon</font>
<font color="#ffff00">was having an affair?</font>

1249
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,240
<font color="#00ff00">You really want the cliches?</font>

1250
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:42,280
<font color="#ffff00">OK. So, you were suspicious.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">So what do you do?</font>

1251
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,880
<font color="#ffff00">You follow him?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Or follow Gabi?</font>

1252
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:47,880
<font color="#00ffff">Maybe it spiralled.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">The two of you fought.</font>

1253
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,360
<font color="#00ff00">What? No!</font>

1254
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:54,600
<font color="#00ff00">I suspected an affair,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">but not with Gabi.</font>

1255
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,760
<font color="#00ff00">It wasn't until after she was...</font>

1256
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,040
<font color="#00ff00">How he reacted to that.</font>

1257
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,560
<font color="#ffff00">And how did he react?</font>

1258
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,760
<font color="#00ff00">He didn't wanna talk about it</font>
<font color="#00ff00">at all.</font>

1259
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,520
<font color="#00ff00">Till it finally made sense to me.</font>

1260
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,440
<font color="#00ff00">Yesterday, I confronted him,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and he denied it, of course.</font>

1261
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,640
<font color="#00ff00">Said I didn't know</font>
<font color="#00ff00">what I was talking about.</font>

1262
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,920
<font color="#00ff00">Didn't know the first thing</font>
<font color="#00ff00">about Gabi.</font>

1263
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,280
<font color="#00ff00">Blurted out about her cancer.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">How he'd known that had been a lie.</font>

1264
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,520
<font color="#ffff00">Well, that must've come as a shock.</font>

1265
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,840
<font color="#00ff00">It was a distraction.</font>

1266
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,160
<font color="#00ffff">Have you any proof</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of this affair with Gabi?</font>

1267
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:30,120
<font color="#00ff00">You need proof, go find it.</font>

1268
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,080
<font color="#00ff00">I don't.</font>

1269
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,720
<font color="#00ff00">I know.</font>

1270
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:40,360
<font color="#00ffff">You seriously think I'd sleep with</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the girl my mam took in?</font>

1271
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,880
<font color="#00ffff">After I knew Gabi was conning her?</font>

1272
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,520
Yeah, sounds ridiculous
when you put it like that.

1273
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,280
So you won't be worried

1274
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:53,920
when my forensic team
go through Gabi's clothes

1275
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:58,240
to see if there's any evidence of
a sexual relationship with you?

1276
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,880
<font color="#00ffff">What?</font>
Your clothes, too, love.

1277
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,720
<font color="#ffff00">Where did Jonathon say he went</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the day that Gabi died?</font>

1278
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,440
<font color="#00ff00">He said he had to speak to someone</font>
<font color="#00ff00">about a loan,</font>

1279
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:12,960
<font color="#00ff00">but from some kind of shady source.</font>

1280
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,280
<font color="#00ff00">So he wanted it kept quiet</font>
<font color="#00ff00">from you lot.</font>

1281
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:16,640
<font color="#00ffff">And you agreed?</font>

1282
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,920
<font color="#ffff00">But now you're worried about</font>
<font color="#ffff00">where he really went?</font>

1283
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,120
<font color="#ffff00">And if he had something to do with</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Gabi's death?</font>

1284
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:24,240
<font color="#00ff00">I... What? No.</font>

1285
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,560
<font color="#ffff00">Because that's what</font>
<font color="#ffff00">we're worried about.</font>

1286
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,320
<font color="#ffff00">You do realise</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that we're investigating a murder</font>

1287
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,000
<font color="#ffff00">and not your husband's fidelity?</font>

1288
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:38,440
It's still a bit
"he said, she said", isn't it?

1289
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,240
<font color="#00ff00">Er, ma'am? We've got 'em.</font>

1290
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,800
<font color="#00ff00">ANPR on Jonathon's car</font>
<font color="#00ff00">plus corroborating cell site data.</font>

1291
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:48,040
Well done, Mark!

1292
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:53,280
Right, you care to join me,
DI Ashworth?

1293
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:55,080
<font color="#ffff00">Good work in there.</font>

1294
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:03,000
<font color="#00ffff">What's this?</font> Your car was flagged
on an ANPR camera in Bewton,

1295
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,280
17:09 last Wednesday.

1296
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,720
<font color="#ffff00">That puts you in the area</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that Gabi's body was found</font>

1297
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,960
<font color="#ffff00">on the day that she died.</font>

1298
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,000
And calls and GPRS data
from your phone

1299
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,960
corroborate the location.

1300
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:20,360
So if I were you, love,
I'd start talking, and fast.

1301
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,480
JONATHON SIGHS

1302
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,880
OK.

1303
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,320
So, when did you find out
Gabi had been faking her cancer?

1304
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,120
<font color="#00ffff">About a month ago.</font>

1305
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,320
<font color="#00ffff">I just asked questions</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Mam never did.</font>

1306
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:35,760
<font color="#ffff00">Like?</font>

1307
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,400
<font color="#00ffff">Why did she really worm into</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Mam's life?</font>

1308
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:41,160
<font color="#00ffff">Why wasn't she on social media?</font>

1309
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:44,280
<font color="#00ffff">Then I looked up her consultants.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Found no record of 'em.</font>

1310
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,320
Ah, quite the discovery.

1311
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:48,280
<font color="#ffff00">So, why didn't you tell your family?</font>

1312
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:51,280
<font color="#00ffff">I had trouble believing it.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Wanted to talk to Gabi first.</font>

1313
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,760
Oh, so she threw herself at you,
did she?

1314
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,640
Beg you to keep quiet?

1315
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,840
<font color="#ffff00">Or maybe it was the sex</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you were always after?</font>

1316
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,560
<font color="#00ffff">No. I never...</font>

1317
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,240
You never what?

1318
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,960
HE SIGHS

1319
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:07,920
<font color="#00ffff">It was the money.</font>

1320
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,800
Money?

1321
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,760
<font color="#00ffff">Mam gave Gabi everything she wanted.</font>

1322
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:16,840
<font color="#00ffff">Poor girl, vulnerable background,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and then the cancer diagnosis.</font>

1323
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,560
And you needed money
for your business.

1324
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:23,080
<font color="#00ffff">I'd asked Mam for a loan.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">It hadn't gone well.</font>

1325
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,760
<font color="#00ffff">But if Gabi tried...</font>

1326
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:29,600
Yeah, so you used Gabi's secret
to blackmail her into helping you.

1327
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,040
<font color="#00ffff">You wanna use the word "blackmail"</font>
<font color="#00ffff">where she's concerned?</font>

1328
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:35,360
Yeah, but no money was forthcoming,
but you still had the affair.

1329
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,600
<font color="#00ffff">She wanted it.</font>

1330
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,640
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, please!</font>

1331
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:41,280
Oh, hold up.

1332
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:45,280
Now, he knew her secret,
but by sleeping with him...

1333
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:50,760
..the power switched right back
to Gabi, didn't it?

1334
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,240
So now you needed her to keep quiet.

1335
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:00,160
Now, she's not here to ask, pet,
so why did you drive to Bewton?

1336
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:04,160
<font color="#00ffff">Gabi rang. Asked to be picked up.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">She didn't show.</font>

1337
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,400
What was she doing there?
<font color="#00ffff">I don't know.</font>

1338
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,360
<font color="#00ffff">She was upset.</font>
About what?

1339
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,880
<font color="#00ffff">Something about things being ruined</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with the family.</font>

1340
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,680
<font color="#00ffff">I thought Mam had found out</font>
<font color="#00ffff">about the cancer.</font>

1341
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,040
<font color="#00ffff">So I drove to pick her up.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">She didn't show.</font>

1342
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,720
<font color="#ffff00">You expect us to believe that?</font>

1343
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:22,680
<font color="#00ffff">Look... I drove to pick her up,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">she didn't show.</font>

1344
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,680
<font color="#00ffff">So I rang her. She didn't answer.</font>

1345
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:28,160
<font color="#00ffff">So I drove home.</font>

1346
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,200
<font color="#00ffff">Alone.</font>

1347
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,920
<font color="#ffff00">Well, he's lied to us repeatedly,</font>

1348
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,800
<font color="#ffff00">he's got clear motive,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and we can place him in the area.</font>

1349
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,600
<font color="#00ff00">Sounds pretty damning to me.</font>
Oh, aye, it does.

1350
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,880
But he said he didn't know

1351
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:43,520
why she was out there
in the middle of nowhere.

1352
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,040
Said she was upset

1353
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:47,560
and thought his mam
had found out the truth.

1354
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:53,000
Now, if he really thought that,
and I'm inclined to believe him,

1355
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,720
why would he kill Gabi?

1356
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,680
<font color="#ffff00">Everyone else is in the clear.</font>

1357
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:00,520
<font color="#ffff00">Helen, Fiona, Tom, Lee.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Everyone except Jonathon.</font>

1358
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:04,760
But that phrase.
<font color="#ffff00">What phrase?</font>

1359
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,720
Gabi accused Lee of "ruining it"
with the family.

1360
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:10,600
And we all assumed she meant

1361
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,800
that he'd exposed her con
to the Rushdens.

1362
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,840
But there's another family in this.

1363
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:21,520
We've been looking at
the wrong family.

1364
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,400
Hello, love. Quick question.

1365
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:31,440
<font color="#00ffff">Are youse releasing Lee?</font>
No.

1366
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,000
<font color="#00ffff">So, what, then?</font>

1367
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,480
Well, I just wanted to ask you...

1368
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:39,200
if you'd contacted Gabi's parents.

1369
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,200
<font color="#00ffff">Er, her parents?</font>

1370
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:44,840
Hmm.
<font color="#00ffff">Er...</font>

1371
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:48,360
Now, I can understand why
you'd want Gabi off the scene, pet.

1372
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:53,000
But, personally, I think you can
do better than Lee Critchley,

1373
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,560
but the heart wants
what the heart wants,

1374
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,520
and you want him, right?

1375
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,680
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

1376
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:03,480
Now, we know you accessed his phone,
read his messages.

1377
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,800
Now, was there a number on there
for Gabi's parents?

1378
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,920
<font color="#00ffff">When Gabi turned up,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">it was obvious she was laying low.</font>

1379
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,520
<font color="#00ffff">Lee said her family</font>
<font color="#00ffff">might be looking for her.</font>

1380
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:19,160
So calling the parents would be
a good way to get rid, right?

1381
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:23,000
<font color="#00ffff">I thought it was worth a try.</font>

1382
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,960
<font color="#00ffff">I, erm, took the number Lee had</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and called it from my phone.</font>

1383
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,640
And what did you tell them?

1384
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:32,040
<font color="#00ffff">I just gave them a number</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to call Gabi on.</font>

1385
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,440
<font color="#00ffff">I told them she was in Newcastle</font>

1386
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,800
<font color="#00ffff">and that she was saying</font>
<font color="#00ffff">she was sick.</font>

1387
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:39,280
<font color="#00ffff">It was a short phone call.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">He hung up.</font>

1388
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,880
He? So it was the father, Matthew?

1389
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:44,920
<font color="#ffff00">How come we haven't been able to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">trace any calls from the McSwains?</font>

1390
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:49,680
Thanks, pet.

1391
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,120
Steph!
<font color="#00ffff">Ma'am?</font>

1392
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,960
This call came in a week ago.
Did you trace it?

1393
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,480
<font color="#00ffff">Er, yeah, yeah, I did trace it.</font>

1394
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,760
<font color="#00ffff">It came from some kind of boat yard.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Likely a wrong number.</font>

1395
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,560
Because this call
is five minutes' long,

1396
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,840
so it's no wrong number, love.

1397
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:21,240
And McSwain's missus says
his boat was in for an overhaul.

1398
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,640
<font color="#ffff00">Find out if they do repairs</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and if his boat was in.</font>

1399
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:25,920
And if it was, when?
<font color="#00ffff">Ma'am.</font>

1400
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,960
Right. Let's get up there.

1401
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,560
<font color="#ffff00">OK. Thanks, Steph. Good work.</font>

1402
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,240
What about McSwain's boat?

1403
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,440
<font color="#ffff00">Well, it went into this place</font>
<font color="#ffff00">last Wednesday.</font>

1404
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,920
<font color="#ffff00">It's only just come out.</font>

1405
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,880
So he wasn't out on the sea
the day Gabi died.

1406
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,720
<font color="#ffff00">Steph spoke to the boat builder.</font>

1407
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,520
<font color="#ffff00">Matthew asked to use</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the office phone.</font>

1408
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,000
<font color="#ffff00">He said his mobile was dead.</font>

1409
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,080
Right, you stay here.

1410
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,800
Hey.

1411
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,720
Oh, me dad always wanted a boat
like this.

1412
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:50,240
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, not many of them left.</font>
Nah.

1413
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:55,920
<font color="#00ffff">Why are you here?</font>

1414
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:02,360
Er, because I need to ask you about
a lass called Sian Jordan.

1415
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:06,040
She rang you, didn't she?
Told you where Gabi was.

1416
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,320
<font color="#00ffff">Picked up, she...</font>

1417
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:14,760
<font color="#00ffff">said it was about my daughter.</font>

1418
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:19,040
And she gave you a number
to call Gabi.

1419
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,440
<font color="#00ffff">And I did... eventually.</font>

1420
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:25,160
And you rang from the boat yard
where this was being repaired?

1421
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:29,240
<font color="#00ffff">I was worried she might not pick up</font>
<font color="#00ffff">if I used my own phone.</font>

1422
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,720
And you arranged to meet her.

1423
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,640
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>
Where?

1424
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:44,320
<font color="#00ffff">There's a... a path we used to hike</font>
<font color="#00ffff">when the kids were younger.</font>

1425
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,520
<font color="#00ffff">Quiet spot. Well away from Debs.</font>

1426
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,080
Deborah didn't know?

1427
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:54,840
<font color="#00ffff">Well, after everything</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Gabi put her through...</font>

1428
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:59,120
<font color="#00ffff">I just...</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I just wanted some honest answers.</font>

1429
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,560
<font color="#00ffff">You know, especially when...</font>

1430
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,080
<font color="#00ffff">..the girl who rang</font>

1431
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,680
<font color="#00ffff">said that Gabi had been saying</font>
<font color="#00ffff">she was sick.</font>

1432
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:10,480
Did you know that wasn't true?
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

1433
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,240
<font color="#00ffff">That's why I wanted to see her.</font>

1434
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,120
<font color="#00ffff">What's worse, eh?</font>

1435
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:18,800
<font color="#00ffff">A second daughter with cancer or...</font>

1436
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:22,120
<font color="#00ffff">or a daughter who'd fake</font>
<font color="#00ffff">having what killed her sister?</font>

1437
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:25,960
<font color="#00ffff">She tried spinning a story at first.</font>

1438
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
<font color="#00ffff">How she was getting back</font>
<font color="#00ffff">on her feet.</font>

1439
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:32,400
<font color="#00ffff">Was sorry</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for what she'd put us through.</font>

1440
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:35,280
<font color="#00ffff">Till I questioned her</font>
<font color="#00ffff">about this illness of hers.</font>

1441
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:39,040
And did she admit
what she'd been doing?<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

1442
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:41,280
<font color="#00ffff">But she couldn't pretend. Not to me.</font>

1443
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,400
<font color="#00ffff">She got angry.</font>

1444
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:50,840
<font color="#00ffff">Started saying that she was getting</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the care and the love</font>

1445
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,480
<font color="#00ffff">that she'd never got</font>
<font color="#00ffff">off me and Debs.</font>

1446
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:54,480
Ah, which made you angry?

1447
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,640
<font color="#00ffff">Course it did.</font>

1448
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:59,320
<font color="#00ffff">You know, because we had loved her.</font>

1449
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:00,840
<font color="#00ffff">And there she was,</font>

1450
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,080
<font color="#00ffff">play-acting at the horror</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that Emma had gone through.</font>

1451
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,200
<font color="#00ffff">Polluting it. It was sick.</font>

1452
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,280
<font color="#00ffff">I sl...</font>

1453
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,400
<font color="#00ffff">I slapped her.</font>

1454
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,600
<font color="#00ffff">And then she... went for me.</font>

1455
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:26,080
<font color="#00ffff">Screaming and shouting.</font>

1456
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:30,000
<font color="#00ff00">You're a total bastard!</font>
<font color="#00ff00">She got everything!</font>

1457
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,600
<font color="#00ffff">How dare you!</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Always!</font>

1458
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,800
<font color="#00ffff">We did our best!</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I got the leftovers!</font>

1459
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,160
<font color="#00ffff">And I just...</font>

1460
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,480
<font color="#00ffff">I just grabbed her.</font>

1461
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,080
<font color="#00ffff">I was... I was furious.</font>

1462
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,960
<font color="#00ffff">I was shaking.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I was shouting at her, and then...</font>

1463
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
<font color="#00ffff">Stupid! Stupid little girl!</font>

1464
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,800
<font color="#00ffff">'And I pushed her,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and she fell over, and...'</font>

1465
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,000
<font color="#00ffff">..I didn't even help her up.</font>

1466
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,240
But she got up.

1467
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,800
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, course she did.</font>

1468
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,880
<font color="#00ffff">Her fight had gone, but, erm....</font>

1469
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:13,080
<font color="#00ffff">She was still screaming at me,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">telling me that...</font>

1470
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,560
<font color="#00ffff">that she wanted me to go.</font>

1471
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,440
<font color="#00ff00">Get away!</font>

1472
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,280
<font color="#00ff00">Get away from me!</font>

1473
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:22,880
<font color="#00ff00">I never want to see you again!</font>

1474
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:26,880
<font color="#00ffff">So, I did.</font>

1475
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:29,640
<font color="#00ffff">I went.</font>

1476
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,040
<font color="#00ffff">'I said...'</font>

1477
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,960
<font color="#00ffff">Fine.</font>

1478
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,200
<font color="#00ffff">But that's it.</font>

1479
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,960
<font color="#00ffff">Hear me, Gabi? That is it.</font>

1480
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,400
<font color="#00ffff">We have no daughter.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">You're dead to us.</font>

1481
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:58,080
You should have told us
all this before, love.

1482
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:01,600
<font color="#00ffff">Well, Debs couldn't know</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that I'd seen Gabi.</font>

1483
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:04,440
<font color="#00ffff">That I'd had that chance</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and then that's how it ended.</font>

1484
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,880
<font color="#00ffff">And what difference</font>
<font color="#00ffff">would it make anyway, eh?</font>

1485
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,960
<font color="#00ffff">When...</font>

1486
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
<font color="#00ffff">When I left her</font>
<font color="#00ffff">just for someone to f...</font>

1487
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:17,280
Except there was no-one else, love.

1488
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:21,560
<font color="#00ffff">Eh?</font>
It was you.

1489
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,120
You shouldn't have left her
in that state.

1490
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,000
GABI GROANS

1491
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,240
<font color="#00ffff">What was me?</font>

1492
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:35,560
When you pushed her...

1493
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,840
..the fall caused a clot here.

1494
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:44,600
And that stopped blood
getting to her brain.

1495
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,880
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

1496
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:58,800
I'm sorry, love.

1497
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,160
<font color="#00ffff">No!</font>

1498
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:10,040
HE WHIMPERS

1499
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,600
HE SHOUTS

1500
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:18,640
HE SOBS

1501
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:38,720
Well, you look better
than when I last saw you.

1502
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:42,000
<font color="#00ff00">Ah, you know.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Just taking it one day at a time.</font>

1503
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:45,400
<font color="#00ff00">You need something?</font>
Aye, me motor needs a service.

1504
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,040
And the MOT is due.

1505
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,520
Well, I want it in safe hands, love.

1506
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,200
Can you manage it?
<font color="#00ff00">Of course.</font>

1507
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,600
<font color="#00ff00">You can leave her here now.</font>
Mm.

1508
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:58,160
And a day at a time's good, love.

1509
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:01,760
But I think your missus
might need you now more than ever.

1510
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:06,240
I think you might be able to salvage
something from all this mess.

1511
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,960
You think about it.

1512
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:16,640
<font color="#ffff00">You're unbelievable.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Sorting your car before your tooth.</font>

1513
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:19,520
Oh, priorities, Joe.

1514
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:23,560
Anyway...
guess where you're dropping me next?

1515
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,080
<font color="#ffff00">Howay, the meter's running.</font>

1516
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:31,760
<font color="#ffff00">Everything go OK?</font>

1517
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,560
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks for waiting, Joe,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">much appreciated (!)</font>

1518
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:42,160
<font color="#ffff00">Can't have been that bad?</font>
MUFFLED: Injection...

1519
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,880
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, you're still numb?</font>

1520
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,280
<font color="#ffff00">Well, a quiet day</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for the rest of us, then.</font>

1521
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,960
KNOCK AT WINDOW

1522
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:15,200
<font color="#00ffff">I'm so sorry...</font>

1523
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:19,040
<font color="#00ffff">..what she put you through.</font>

1524
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:20,760
<font color="#00ff00">No.</font>

1525
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:23,840
<font color="#00ff00">I can't say you've been</font>
<font color="#00ff00">any worse a mother than me.</font>

1526
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:44,600
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you.</font>
