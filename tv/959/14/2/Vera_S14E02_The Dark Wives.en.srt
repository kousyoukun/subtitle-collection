1
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,480
That's it. Nearly there, lass.

2
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.960 align:center line:-3
Can you see the nest?

3
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.960 align:center line:-3
Yeah.

4
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.960 align:center line:-4
Well, pick the eggs up, then.
Gentle, mind!

5
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.640 align:center line:-3
What's the matter?

6
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.960 align:center line:-4
Don't be scared, girl.
You won't fall.

7
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.960 align:center line:-4
The Dark Wives
are watching over you.

8
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.640 align:center line:-3
I'm not scared, Dad. It's wrong.

9
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.000 align:center line:-4
That's it, Vera.
Nearly there, lass.

10
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.960 align:center line:-4
Can you see the nest?
Yeah.

11
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.960 align:center line:-5
So... It's a stabbing.

12
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.640 align:center line:-6
Oh, you're back, then.
I went to visit Kenny in hospital.

13
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.960 align:center line:-6
He talked about coming back to work,
so I thought, if he can do it...

14
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.960 align:center line:-6
Er, it was an early morning birder
who found the body, Ma'am.

15
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.960 align:center line:-6
Steph's with him now.
Good to have you back, Joe.

16
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.960 align:center line:-6
Decided to surprise us all.
Now, where's Paula?

17
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.160 align:center line:-4
Listen, can we just talk
about the other day?

18
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.960 align:center line:-4
Look, there's a time and a place,
Joe.

19
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.960 align:center line:-3
There's a young man dead over here.

20
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.320 align:center line:-4
We're really out
in the middle of nowhere this time.

21
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.960 align:center line:-4
Well, not for some.
Know the place, do you?

22
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.960 align:center line:-4
Used to come here as a kid.
So, what can you tell us?

23
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.960 align:center line:-4
Stab wound nicked
the carotid artery.

24
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.960 align:center line:-3
Would've bled out in minutes.

25
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.960 align:center line:-4
No other cuts
or significant bruising.

26
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.960 align:center line:-4
Any sign of the murder weapon?
That would be too easy.

27
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.960 align:center line:-4
Young man. Stabbing. Makes it
seem gang related, doesn't it?

28
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.960 align:center line:-4
Well, that's pure speculation
at this stage.

29
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.960 align:center line:-4
Time of death?
Rigor mortis is well established.

30
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.960 align:center line:-4
Drying of the peripheries.
I'd say at least 12 hours.

31
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.960 align:center line:-4
So, he's been lying out here
all night?

32
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.960 align:center line:-3
No. The body was moved here.

33
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.960 align:center line:-4
No blood spatter. No evidence at all
that this is the murder site.

34
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.960 align:center line:-4
Is there any evidence
of who dumped him here?

35
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.960 align:center line:-3
Must've used a vehicle.

36
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.960 align:center line:-4
Parked on the road
and carried him down here.

37
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.960 align:center line:-4
The ground is rocky
or covered in springy turf,

38
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.960 align:center line:-4
so we haven't had much luck
with shoe prints.

39
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.960 align:center line:-4
And there'll be hikers
visiting the stones, of course.

40
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.960 align:center line:-4
Any ID on him?
Driving licence and a student pass.

41
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.960 align:center line:-4
Name's Joshua Worsten.
Oh, and he had this.

42
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.320 align:center line:-4
Rosefall House.
Do we know what that is?

43
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.960 align:center line:-3
Isn't that what Google's for?

44
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.960 align:center line:-3
Anything else you get, ASAP.

45
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.640 align:center line:-4
One of those
wrong side of the bed mornings?

46
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.800 align:center line:-3
I heard that.

47
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.960 align:center line:-4
Nearest ANPR cameras
are miles away, Ma'am.

48
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.800 align:center line:-4
So that makes them useless,
does it?

49
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.960 align:center line:-3
Er, well, no.

50
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.960 align:center line:-4
We can note any vehicles
coming in this direction.

51
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.960 align:center line:-4
And the village of Ghyllstead
is just over the moor.

52
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.800 align:center line:-4
Aye, I know it is.
So get it checked out.

53
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.960 align:center line:-4
OK, Ma'am. We should also
get a door knock going.

54
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.960 align:center line:-3
Right. Do it.

55
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.960 align:center line:-4
And we should inform
the uni as well.

56
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.000 align:center line:-4
There must be a reason they brought
a dead student all the way here.

57
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.640 align:center line:-3
Mm.

58
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.160 align:center line:-3
Now, the Dark Wives.

59
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.960 align:center line:-4
That's what those stones
are called around here.

60
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.960 align:center line:-4
This something ritualistic?
Oh!

61
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.960 align:center line:-3
First gangs. Now witchcraft.

62
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.800 align:center line:-3
So, have you got the next of kin?

63
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.960 align:center line:-4
Er, yes. I've got the parents'
name and address, Ma'am.

64
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.160 align:center line:-3
They're over in Cullerton.

65
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.000 align:center line:-3
Oh, very nice.

66
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.960 align:center line:-4
So, I'll go there first.
And you check out this Rosefall.

67
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.960 align:center line:-4
I'll Google it. Oh, and, Ma'am,
can I let the birder go?

68
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.960 align:center line:-3
Er, he's a local.

69
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.480 align:center line:-4
Found the body at six,
been in the area since half five.

70
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.960 align:center line:-3
Er, Jimmy Hebble.

71
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.960 align:center line:-4
He's the gamekeeper
for the big estate at Lingholm.

72
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.320 align:center line:-3
Jimmy Hebble? Is he now?

73
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.960 align:center line:-4
So we know where to find him
if we need him.

74
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.960 align:center line:-3
Right, I'm going to see the family.

75
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.320 align:center line:-3
You coming, or what?

76
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.960 align:center line:-3
HE EXHALES

77
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.960 align:center line:-3
I sent in my statement to the IOPC

78
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.640 align:center line:-4
about what happened last week
with Lucas Corbridge.

79
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.480 align:center line:-4
Ah, we're waiting to hear
if they're satisfied.

80
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.320 align:center line:-3
You said you came here as a kid?

81
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, with my dad.
Bird-watching trips.

82
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.960 align:center line:-3
"Witch Hunt"? What's that?

83
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.960 align:center line:-4
It's a glorified game
of hide-and-seek.

84
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.960 align:center line:-3
An old village tradition.

85
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.960 align:center line:-3
Is it connected to those Dark Wives?

86
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.960 align:center line:-4
I bet there's a good story
why they're called that.

87
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.960 align:center line:-4
Well, it's said there's a witch
trapped under each stone

88
00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.640 align:center line:-3
by a carving on the underside.

89
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.000 align:center line:-4
Probably just a ploy
to shut women up.

90
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000 align:center line:-3
Ah, chance'd be a fine thing.

91
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.960 align:center line:-3
Only kidding.

92
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.960 align:center line:-4
It wasn't me running
my mouth off a few days back.

93
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.800 align:center line:-3
Saying you wanted shot of me.

94
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.160 align:center line:-4
But, yeah, no it's good to know
how you really feel.

95
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.320 align:center line:-3
TEXT ALERT

96
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.960 align:center line:-3
Hang on, it's Steph.

97
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.960 align:center line:-4
She says Rosefall House is a kids'
residential home in Longwater.

98
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.960 align:center line:-4
Longwater?
It's a former pit village.

99
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.960 align:center line:-4
Tell her to phone.
Find out our student's connection.

100
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.960 align:center line:-3
SHE CRIES QUIETLY

101
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.800 align:center line:-3
We are so sorry, love.

102
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.960 align:center line:-4
And we will, of course, when you're
ready, need a formal identification.

103
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.960 align:center line:-4
Now, can I just get
a few details from you?

104
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.320 align:center line:-4
Your son was a student?
Yeah. Accounting and Finance degree.

105
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.960 align:center line:-4
Did he live at home?
No.

106
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.960 align:center line:-4
No, we'd got under
each other's feet.

107
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.480 align:center line:-4
I'm an accountant,
and I run my own firm from home.

108
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.000 align:center line:-4
Anna's a GP.
At the health centre in Tynemouth.

109
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.800 align:center line:-4
We bought a place for Josh
in Jesmond

110
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.960 align:center line:-4
after his first year in halls,
for him and a flatmate.

111
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.960 align:center line:-3
Giving him more of a uni experience.

112
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.960 align:center line:-4
Came back most weekends
with his washing.

113
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.960 align:center line:-3
Could we get that address?

114
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.960 align:center line:-4
So, when did you last see Josh?
Erm...

115
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.960 align:center line:-3
Erm... Sunday, a week ago.

116
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.960 align:center line:-3
We'd gone on one of our walks.

117
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.960 align:center line:-4
Something we tried
to keep up once a month.

118
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.960 align:center line:-3
Is that just the two of you?

119
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.800 align:center line:-3
Yeah, they liked exploring.

120
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.960 align:center line:-4
I used the time
to catch up on admin.

121
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.640 align:center line:-4
Did you ever walk
the Ghyllstead Plains?

122
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.960 align:center line:-3
Yeah. Yeah, we had done.

123
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.800 align:center line:-3
Not often, though.

124
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.960 align:center line:-4
Now, apart from his flatmate,
did he have other friends?

125
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.960 align:center line:-3
A relationship?

126
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.960 align:center line:-4
No girlfriend since Stella,
his, erm... his big teenage love.

127
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.960 align:center line:-4
Stella Marsh.
They were together at school.

128
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.960 align:center line:-4
And, er, what can you tell us
about his connection

129
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.960 align:center line:-3
to a children's residential home?

130
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.800 align:center line:-4
Place called Rosefall
over in Longwater?

131
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.960 align:center line:-4
Longwater?
Mm.

132
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.640 align:center line:-3
Well, why would he be going there?

133
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.000 align:center line:-4
Well, he had an ID card
with that name on.

134
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.960 align:center line:-3
It's OK, we can check.

135
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.960 align:center line:-4
You can't think of anyone
who might wanna harm him?

136
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.960 align:center line:-3
Josh? No.

137
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.960 align:center line:-3
No, he was never in trouble. He...

138
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.320 align:center line:-3
He was... He had a lust for life.

139
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.960 align:center line:-3
He was... he was always curious.

140
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.320 align:center line:-3
He loved people.

141
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.160 align:center line:-3
Well, we'll let ourselves out.

142
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.800 align:center line:-3
TEXT ALERT

143
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.960 align:center line:-3
Ah, here we go. This is from Steph.

144
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.800 align:center line:-4
Our deceased was
an independent visitor at Rosefall.

145
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.960 align:center line:-4
Volunteered his time
to meet a kid placed there.

146
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.960 align:center line:-3
Well, that's noble.

147
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.960 align:center line:-4
Why wouldn't
he tell his parents that?

148
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.960 align:center line:-4
Maybe he thought
his mam wouldn't approve.

149
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.960 align:center line:-4
She didn't like the thought of him
being anywhere near Longwater.

150
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.960 align:center line:-4
There's more. He was expected there
yesterday evening. Never showed up.

151
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.000 align:center line:-4
And this Rosefall place are saying
that a resident's gone missing.

152
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.320 align:center line:-3
A 16-year-old lass.

153
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.960 align:center line:-3
Hiya. Are you the detectives?

154
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.960 align:center line:-3
Aye. DCI Stanhope with DI Ashworth.

155
00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.320 align:center line:-4
Dave Limbal. I'm the manager
of this place. Thanks for coming.

156
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.800 align:center line:-4
We're all very worried about Chloe.
Ah, well, er...

157
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.960 align:center line:-4
We're here about another matter
as well, love, so, shall we?

158
00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.480 align:center line:-3
Oh, yeah, yeah.

159
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.960 align:center line:-4
Wait. Josh. He's dead?
I'm afraid so, love.

160
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.960 align:center line:-4
Now, we understand
he was expected here last night?

161
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah. We, er...
We do a film night on a Sunday.

162
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.960 align:center line:-4
Chills the kids out
before battling the new week.

163
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.960 align:center line:-4
It was actually his idea.
He liked picking the films.

164
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.960 align:center line:-3
And now this missing lass.

165
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.960 align:center line:-3
Chloe Spencer. Just turned 16.

166
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.640 align:center line:-3
And did she know Josh well?

167
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.960 align:center line:-4
Erm, a little. He was an IV,
independent visitor,

168
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.960 align:center line:-4
attached to another of our kids,
Noah Hews.

169
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.960 align:center line:-3
He's a 14-year-old lad.

170
00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.160 align:center line:-3
When did you last see Chloe?

171
00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.800 align:center line:-4
I checked on her
round 6pm yesterday.

172
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.960 align:center line:-4
Erm, she just wanted
to stay in her room.

173
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, I realised she was missing
first thing this morning.

174
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.800 align:center line:-4
Hold on. Are you saying
she's been missing all night?

175
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.960 align:center line:-3
And nobody noticed?

176
00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.960 align:center line:-4
Well, the older kids
have a degree of independence.

177
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.960 align:center line:-3
I mean, we don't lock her door.

178
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.960 align:center line:-4
This isn't secure accommodation,
and she's not a danger to herself.

179
00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.640 align:center line:-3
So, who was in charge overnight?

180
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.960 align:center line:-3
I was on sleepover duty.

181
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.960 align:center line:-3
I left round 8:30.

182
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.960 align:center line:-4
And did you see anyone
about when you left? No.

183
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.960 align:center line:-4
Well... there was a truck
parked on the road.

184
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.960 align:center line:-3
Down by the bus stop.

185
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.960 align:center line:-4
Sorry, I...
I didn't pay much attention.

186
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.000 align:center line:-3
I notice you've got CCTV?

187
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, it covers anyone approaching
the front door or the back door.

188
00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, well,
we'll need to see the footage.

189
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.960 align:center line:-4
So, this lass, Chloe.
Why was she placed here?

190
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.960 align:center line:-3
Her dad died. Mam struggled to cope.

191
00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.960 align:center line:-4
Chloe was practically her carer.
But then her mam was sectioned.

192
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.000 align:center line:-3
Ah, the poor lass.

193
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.960 align:center line:-4
OK. Can you show us her room, love?
Of course. Follow me.

194
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.960 align:center line:-4
Do you wanna take a scout
round outside?

195
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.960 align:center line:-4
This is Chloe's room.
She's a thing for pagan stuff.

196
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.960 align:center line:-4
"The Longwater Witch,"
the kids call her.

197
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.960 align:center line:-3
Oh, my DI would love that.

198
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.800 align:center line:-3
That's Chloe and her mum.

199
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.960 align:center line:-3
WALL THUDS

200
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.960 align:center line:-3
That's Chloe's diary.

201
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.960 align:center line:-4
She's always very secretive
about it.

202
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.960 align:center line:-3
Aren't we all, love?

203
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.960 align:center line:-3
You OK, lad?

204
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.960 align:center line:-3
"Guess I'm alone here, then.

205
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.960 align:center line:-3
"Fine. Alone's OK.

206
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.960 align:center line:-3
"I can look after myself.

207
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.800 align:center line:-3
"And I'll tell him so.

208
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.960 align:center line:-3
"He's dead to me."

209
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.800 align:center line:-3
JOE: Boss! You wanna see this!

210
00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.960 align:center line:-4
He found it while he was playing.
What?

211
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.960 align:center line:-3
Right, call forensics.

212
00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.960 align:center line:-4
Tell them we think
we've found our murder site.

213
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.960 align:center line:-3
And we need to find Chloe Spencer.

214
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.960 align:center line:-4
CHLOE:
'Mum's depression's really bad.

215
00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.960 align:center line:-4
'I need to be strong,
but I don't know what to do.

216
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.960 align:center line:-3
'I feel like I'm losing her.'

217
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.960 align:center line:-3
Vera? Are you still up?

218
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.960 align:center line:-3
Chuck you out again, did they, Dad?

219
00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.640 align:center line:-3
I don't wanna be here.

220
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.960 align:center line:-3
Not without your mam.

221
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.000 align:center line:-3
Come on. Let's get you to bed.

222
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.960 align:center line:-4
Get off. Get off, I don't...
I don't need...

223
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.000 align:center line:-3
Place is... It's too empty.

224
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.960 align:center line:-3
MUFFLED: Boss?

225
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.960 align:center line:-3
Boss? You OK?

226
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:24.960 align:center line:-4
Anything in there
about the deceased?

227
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.960 align:center line:-3
Well, I've been skimming through it.

228
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.960 align:center line:-4
When her dad died, the poor lass
had to parent her parent.

229
00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.960 align:center line:-4
Whole days trying
to get her mam out of bed.

230
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.960 align:center line:-3
The weight of that on a youngster.

231
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.960 align:center line:-4
Oh, and you never forget
something like that, believe me.

232
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.960 align:center line:-3
Anything else in there about Josh?

233
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.960 align:center line:-4
Well, she mentions a "J",
that could be him.

234
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.960 align:center line:-4
Says he was smart
and that he cared.

235
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.160 align:center line:-4
Well, wonder what changed her mind
on him?

236
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.800 align:center line:-4
Well, we don't know
that anything did.

237
00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.960 align:center line:-3
Forensics are here.

238
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.960 align:center line:-3
Right, let's leave them to it.

239
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.960 align:center line:-4
Listen, there's nothing
that you need to worry about.

240
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.960 align:center line:-3
They've just...

241
00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.960 align:center line:-4
They're here cos they've just
got to have a look out back.

242
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.960 align:center line:-3
Won't be here long.

243
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:15.960 align:center line:-3
Hello, love.

244
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.960 align:center line:-4
And you are...?
Who's asking?

245
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.960 align:center line:-3
Bradley!

246
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.000 align:center line:-4
He's just back home.
Ah, that's all right.

247
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.960 align:center line:-3
Now, we're from the police, pet.

248
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.960 align:center line:-4
Have you told him?
Had to explain the circus outside.

249
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.960 align:center line:-3
And you didn't see Josh last night?

250
00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.960 align:center line:-4
Nah. I was watching the film.
He never showed.

251
00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.960 align:center line:-4
What about Chloe? Are you friends?
No.

252
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.960 align:center line:-4
She's never had much time
for anyone here.

253
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.000 align:center line:-3
Liked him, though.

254
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.960 align:center line:-4
What, she had a bit of a crush,
did she?

255
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.640 align:center line:-4
Maybe. Nothing inappropriate.
She wishes.

256
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.000 align:center line:-4
Well, we'll get
a formal statement later.

257
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.960 align:center line:-4
This is a nightmare.
Well, I'm sorry, love.

258
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.480 align:center line:-4
We're definitely gonna need
that CCTV now.

259
00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.480 align:center line:-4
You can't seriously think
that anyone from Rosefall

260
00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.960 align:center line:-3
was involved in Josh's death?

261
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.320 align:center line:-3
Especially Chloe.

262
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.960 align:center line:-4
We have to consider everything,
love.

263
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.960 align:center line:-3
For all we know,

264
00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.960 align:center line:-4
that could be Chloe's blood
we found.

265
00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.960 align:center line:-4
Now, in her diary,
she mentions an Esther and an Alice?

266
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.960 align:center line:-3
Don't know about Alice.

267
00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.960 align:center line:-4
Esther's a friend
from Cravenwest Academy.

268
00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.960 align:center line:-3
Cravenwest?

269
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.960 align:center line:-4
Well, that's all discipline
and outstanding results, isn't it?

270
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.960 align:center line:-3
Bit of a feat for this side of town.

271
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.960 align:center line:-4
Well, Chloe's got a lot
going for her.

272
00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.960 align:center line:-3
You know, she's bright, well-read.

273
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.960 align:center line:-3
OK. We'll talk to them.

274
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.960 align:center line:-4
Now, you call us immediately
if she turns up or makes contact.

275
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.960 align:center line:-3
CHLOE: 'Just me in this place, then.

276
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.960 align:center line:-4
'So I guess I'll survive on my own.
Fight on alone.'

277
00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.960 align:center line:-4
OK, come on!
SHE CLAPS

278
00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.960 align:center line:-4
We've got a dead student,
Josh Worsten, killed Sunday night.

279
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.960 align:center line:-4
And his body was found
at Ghyllstead.

280
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.960 align:center line:-3
Now, until Paula tells us otherwise,

281
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.960 align:center line:-4
my instinct tells me
we've also found our murder site.

282
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.960 align:center line:-3
And that's at Rosefall House, here.

283
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.960 align:center line:-3
So, what else do we need from them?

284
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.960 align:center line:-3
Well, come on! Someone?

285
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.960 align:center line:-4
Er, well... Statements
from all the kids and adults.

286
00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.960 align:center line:-4
Plus, we've got a search
of the place ongoing.

287
00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.960 align:center line:-4
It sounds like most of them
were at this film night

288
00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:41.960 align:center line:-3
yesterday evening, anyway.

289
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.960 align:center line:-4
Oh, and we just take their word
for that, do we, Steph?

290
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.000 align:center line:-3
Well, no...

291
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.960 align:center line:-4
Because manager Dave
wasn't there, for one.

292
00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.960 align:center line:-4
He was in his office
doing paperwork.

293
00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.320 align:center line:-4
So, we check the CCTV
once we've got it.

294
00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.960 align:center line:-3
And look for anyone coming or going.

295
00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.960 align:center line:-3
Aye, and I want that ASAP.

296
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.960 align:center line:-4
And I don't want any foot-dragging
from Dave Limbal either.

297
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.960 align:center line:-4
Now, we already know
that someone left the premises.

298
00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.160 align:center line:-4
So unless the blood is hers, then
Chloe Spencer is our prime suspect.

299
00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.960 align:center line:-4
Maybe she had a crush on the fella
and things turned sour?

300
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.320 align:center line:-4
Oh, well, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

301
00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.960 align:center line:-3
We need to find the lass.

302
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.800 align:center line:-4
But if she was involved,
it couldn't have been alone.

303
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.960 align:center line:-3
How would she move the body?

304
00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.960 align:center line:-4
There's plenty of parking spots
tucked round the back.

305
00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.960 align:center line:-3
Tracey Jacks takes the bus to work.

306
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.800 align:center line:-3
And Dave Limbal cycled yesterday.

307
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.960 align:center line:-4
Well, what about the truck that
Tracey saw parked on the main road?

308
00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.960 align:center line:-3
Aye. Hm.

309
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:41.960 align:center line:-4
So that's more ANPR work
for you, and traffic cams.

310
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.960 align:center line:-4
Unless that's too much bother?
No, no. Course not, Ma'am.

311
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.960 align:center line:-4
So, if Chloe was involved,
could she be round Ghyllstead, then?

312
00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.960 align:center line:-3
Ah. Now, that is a good shout.

313
00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.960 align:center line:-4
We've already got a door knock
going, so let's ask about her too.

314
00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:02.960 align:center line:-4
Her only living relatives are
her mam and paternal grandparents.

315
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.960 align:center line:-3
Her mam was sectioned.

316
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.960 align:center line:-4
Her grandparents were asked
about taking Chloe,

317
00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.960 align:center line:-4
but they were worried
they couldn't handle her.

318
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.960 align:center line:-4
So we just leave it at that, do we?
Put a call in.

319
00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.960 align:center line:-4
We also need to build a timeline
for the deceased.

320
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.960 align:center line:-4
So I want cash transactions,
phone records.

321
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.960 align:center line:-4
Somebody talk to the flatmate,
academic tutors, the lot.

322
00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:28.320 align:center line:-4
Because at this moment, we have no
idea why anyone wanted the lad dead.

323
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.480 align:center line:-4
So, come on.
SHE CLAPS

324
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.800 align:center line:-3
I want everyone delivering!

325
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.960 align:center line:-4
So get some rest,
and we start first thing.

326
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.960 align:center line:-3
Hey. Oi!

327
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.320 align:center line:-3
Sling your hook, go on!

328
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.960 align:center line:-4
Don't you dare do that
in my garden. Go on. Go on.

329
00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.160 align:center line:-3
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

330
00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.960 align:center line:-4
Go on, clear off. And stay out!
DOG BARKS

331
00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:22.960 align:center line:-4
Joe. Do you know why the boss
is so crabby at the minute?

332
00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.960 align:center line:-4
Crabbier than usual.
Really on our backs.

333
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.960 align:center line:-4
Have you noticed?
Flat B, right?

334
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:26.960 align:center line:-3
DOORBELL BUZZES

335
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.960 align:center line:-4
She's just got a lot on her mind
right now.

336
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.960 align:center line:-3
How's Chloe been lately?

337
00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.960 align:center line:-4
I've been her form tutor
several years now.

338
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.640 align:center line:-4
And she's very bright.
Voracious reader.

339
00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.960 align:center line:-3
Has a real way with words.

340
00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.960 align:center line:-3
Aye. I've read some of them.

341
00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.960 align:center line:-4
I felt like I... I got a sense
of her and her family.

342
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.960 align:center line:-3
Yes. Well...

343
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.960 align:center line:-4
When her dad got sick,
then passed away,

344
00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.960 align:center line:-4
and as things worsened
with her mother...

345
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:56.960 align:center line:-3
What, she struggled?

346
00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.800 align:center line:-3
She was angry. Understandably.

347
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.960 align:center line:-3
Always had a questioning spirit.

348
00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.960 align:center line:-4
But she became more...
directly confrontational.

349
00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.800 align:center line:-3
Picked fights.

350
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.320 align:center line:-4
Physical fights?
Sometimes.

351
00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.640 align:center line:-4
Now, I understand she has
a friend here called Esther?

352
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.960 align:center line:-3
Used to be great friends, yes.

353
00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.960 align:center line:-3
Used to be?

354
00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.160 align:center line:-3
Chris told me about Josh.

355
00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.960 align:center line:-3
Chris? That's Josh's dad, yeah?

356
00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, he, er...
he came by last night.

357
00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.960 align:center line:-3
Felt I should know.

358
00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.960 align:center line:-4
Poor guy. Think he just wanted
to be close to him.

359
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.480 align:center line:-3
Seemed lost.

360
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.960 align:center line:-3
How did Josh seem lately?

361
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.480 align:center line:-3
Fine. Normal.

362
00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.960 align:center line:-3
Er... he worked hard.

363
00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.480 align:center line:-4
Even though
he didn't love his course.

364
00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.320 align:center line:-4
Classic case of doing it
to please his parents.

365
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.640 align:center line:-4
Were you on the same degree?
Er, no.

366
00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.960 align:center line:-4
I'm Architecture.
We met as freshers in halls.

367
00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.960 align:center line:-4
Look, I'm not trying
to diss his folks.

368
00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.800 align:center line:-4
I got lucky when
they bought this place for him.

369
00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:02.960 align:center line:-3
Can I take a look at his bedroom?

370
00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.960 align:center line:-3
Erm, yeah. Yeah. Sure.

371
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.640 align:center line:-4
Now, then, you and Chloe
used to be friends.

372
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.960 align:center line:-3
But... you drifted apart.

373
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.960 align:center line:-3
Now, any reason for that?

374
00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.960 align:center line:-4
SHE SIGHS
It's been a busy year.

375
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.960 align:center line:-4
Exams. I guess
I didn't want any distractions.

376
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.960 align:center line:-4
Ah, it's been a hard time
for Chloe too.

377
00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.800 align:center line:-4
What with her mam.
And then being taken into care.

378
00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.960 align:center line:-3
My dad...

379
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.960 align:center line:-4
He said I needed to put
some space between us.

380
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.160 align:center line:-4
Mm. So, when did you last see her?
Last week sometime.

381
00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.960 align:center line:-4
We're home on study leave
some days now.

382
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.960 align:center line:-3
Fewer distractions, eh?

383
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.320 align:center line:-3
Not in our house.

384
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.960 align:center line:-4
I go to the library
in Cullenborough. Mm.

385
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.960 align:center line:-4
Now, did she ever mention
a Josh Worsten to you?

386
00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.960 align:center line:-4
Josh... Yeah. I think she maybe had
a bit of a thing for him?

387
00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.320 align:center line:-3
Is Josh the lad who was killed?

388
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.480 align:center line:-4
Cos Chloe'd never hurt anyone.
Is that a witch's knot?

389
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.960 align:center line:-4
They shouldn't really have jewellery
on in school. But it's fine.

390
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.960 align:center line:-4
Chloe had one too.
We got our initials put on them.

391
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.960 align:center line:-3
KNOCK ON DOOR

392
00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.960 align:center line:-4
Who's this, now?
Helen Allenby.

393
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.480 align:center line:-4
She's... She's the lady
who set up the Academy.

394
00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.960 align:center line:-4
It's not usual for the founder
to be walking the corridors, is it?

395
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.320 align:center line:-4
When I found
one of our pupils was missing...

396
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.960 align:center line:-4
Well, listen, if there's any help
you need in finding Chloe,

397
00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.960 align:center line:-4
anything at all, then please,
come direct to me.

398
00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.960 align:center line:-3
Ah, thanks, love. That's very kind.

399
00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.960 align:center line:-3
I suppose this sort of thing

400
00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.960 align:center line:-4
doesn't look too great
for the school, does it?

401
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.960 align:center line:-3
Beside the point.

402
00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.960 align:center line:-4
I'm actually a Longwater girl
myself, originally.

403
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.960 align:center line:-4
And I know Chloe's been having
a tough time.

404
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.960 align:center line:-4
But I'm a firm believer
in overcoming odds.

405
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.000 align:center line:-4
Had Josh had an argument
with anyone?

406
00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.480 align:center line:-4
Nah.
No? No-one at all?

407
00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.960 align:center line:-3
There was this, erm...

408
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.960 align:center line:-4
one weird thing
a couple of nights back.

409
00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.960 align:center line:-4
Erm, there was this pick-up truck
parked outside.

410
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.960 align:center line:-4
The driver, he got out.
Stopped Josh.

411
00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.960 align:center line:-4
Josh said it was fine,
told me to go on in.

412
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.960 align:center line:-4
But I looked out the window
to see if he was OK.

413
00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.960 align:center line:-3
And?

414
00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.960 align:center line:-4
A pretty heated discussion.
Josh looked upset.

415
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.960 align:center line:-3
Not shouting, but raised voices.

416
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.960 align:center line:-4
Did you hear
what they were talking about? No.

417
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.960 align:center line:-4
Er, well...
Something about Josh letting go?

418
00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.480 align:center line:-3
Thanks.

419
00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.000 align:center line:-4
Is Chloe Spencer seriously
a suspect in this fella's murder?

420
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.960 align:center line:-4
The children's home
have just told me she is.

421
00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.960 align:center line:-3
Oh, and hello to you too.

422
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.960 align:center line:-4
Well, they've no business
saying that.

423
00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.960 align:center line:-3
That's pure speculation.

424
00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.960 align:center line:-3
But the good news is

425
00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.960 align:center line:-4
that the blood found at the murder
site belongs to the deceased.

426
00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.960 align:center line:-4
Not Chloe.
OK. But she's still missing.

427
00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.960 align:center line:-4
And although Rosefall's
privately run,

428
00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.960 align:center line:-4
it's still the local authority
that placed Chloe there,

429
00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.960 align:center line:-3
which makes her my responsibility.

430
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.640 align:center line:-4
What does that mean,
"privately run"?

431
00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.960 align:center line:-4
Well, there's not enough spaces
to place kids in care.

432
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.480 align:center line:-4
And to some, that may suggest
a gap in the market.

433
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.960 align:center line:-4
Hm. I'd better crack on, then,
get some answers. Good.

434
00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.960 align:center line:-4
And maybe after we've wrapped up
this mess, we can have that drink.

435
00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.960 align:center line:-4
Celebrate your promotion?
Yeah. That'd be nice, yeah.

436
00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.960 align:center line:-4
I'll be in touch, Kath.
I won't hold my breath.

437
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.960 align:center line:-3
You're sure?

438
00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.960 align:center line:-4
The flatmate saw someone
threaten Josh?

439
00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.960 align:center line:-3
Well, not threatened.

440
00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.960 align:center line:-4
But it definitely rattled him.
Plus, he drove a pick-up truck.

441
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:43.960 align:center line:-4
So we've got another suspect
besides Chloe Spencer.

442
00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.160 align:center line:-4
Aye. But her running off
doesn't looks good for her.

443
00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.960 align:center line:-4
So, that makes her guilty,
does it, Joe?

444
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.960 align:center line:-3
No, it doesn't.

445
00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.960 align:center line:-4
She might've seen something and been
scared or hurt. Or abducted, even.

446
00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.960 align:center line:-4
Exactly. Now, can we match
this pick-up truck

447
00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.960 align:center line:-4
to the one Tracey Jacks
saw outside the kids home?

448
00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.640 align:center line:-4
I've been gathering possibilities
on that vehicle from ANPR.

449
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.960 align:center line:-4
I could cross-reference it
with any CCTV near Josh's digs.

450
00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah. Good. Do it.
And his laptop was missing, Ma'am.

451
00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.960 align:center line:-4
But the battery pack
was still there.

452
00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.480 align:center line:-3
So, what are we doing to find it?

453
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.960 align:center line:-4
Well, there might be a facility
to track it remotely.

454
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.960 align:center line:-3
But that's only if he set it up.

455
00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.960 align:center line:-3
Yeah, well, get tracking.

456
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.960 align:center line:-4
You don't need my permission
for that.

457
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.960 align:center line:-4
Now, Mark, have you got
into his phone yet?

458
00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.960 align:center line:-4
Er, yes, Ma'am. He only called
one person the night he died.

459
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.800 align:center line:-4
Stella Marsh.
Stella?

460
00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.960 align:center line:-4
Didn't his parents say
he had an ex called Stella?

461
00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.960 align:center line:-3
Aye. They did.

462
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.800 align:center line:-4
Yeah, well, maybe not so "ex".
He called and texted her regularly.

463
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.960 align:center line:-3
On the day he died,

464
00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.960 align:center line:-4
Josh called her four times
between 5:38 and 5:52.

465
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.960 align:center line:-4
Well, I think we need
to pay Stella Marsh a visit.

466
00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.960 align:center line:-3
COWS MOO

467
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.960 align:center line:-3
Excuse me. Can I help you?

468
00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.960 align:center line:-4
Er, I hope so, love.
DCI Stanhope with DI Ashworth.

469
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.960 align:center line:-3
Are you Stella Marsh?

470
00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.960 align:center line:-4
You here about the break-in?
Dad said not to bother reporting it.

471
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.960 align:center line:-4
What break-in?
Follow me.

472
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.160 align:center line:-3
Mind where you step.

473
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.960 align:center line:-4
It's happened before, see.
Probably just someone homeless.

474
00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.800 align:center line:-4
Do you know Josh Worsten?
Josh? Yeah, why?

475
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.960 align:center line:-4
Boyfriend?
No. Not for a long time.

476
00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.960 align:center line:-3
Here it is.

477
00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.960 align:center line:-4
Not the most secure. But then,
there's nothing to steal inside.

478
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.960 align:center line:-3
So, why are you asking about Josh?

479
00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.960 align:center line:-4
Ah, well, he called you on Sunday.
Yeah.

480
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.960 align:center line:-3
We'd said we might meet in town.

481
00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.960 align:center line:-4
I didn't go in the end.
But how do you...?

482
00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.960 align:center line:-3
Well, I'm sorry to have to tell you.

483
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.960 align:center line:-4
But we found
his body yesterday, pet.

484
00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.960 align:center line:-3
What?

485
00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.960 align:center line:-4
Josh?
Boss.

486
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.000 align:center line:-3
Stay there.

487
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:14.960 align:center line:-4
They've cleared some space
at the side.

488
00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.960 align:center line:-4
Empty food wrappers
and a drinks bottle.

489
00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.960 align:center line:-3
And I found this.

490
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.960 align:center line:-4
That's Chloe Spencer's.
She was here?

491
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.000 align:center line:-3
Where are you, Chloe?

492
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.960 align:center line:-3
Uniform are with Stella.

493
00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.960 align:center line:-4
We'll get a team in to fingerprint
and search the outbuilding.

494
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.960 align:center line:-3
Well, that pendant's enough for me.

495
00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:57.960 align:center line:-4
Tells me the lass is alive
and she spent last night here.

496
00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.800 align:center line:-3
Hiding. From what? Who?

497
00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.960 align:center line:-4
Stella Marsh said she had no idea
there was someone sleeping there.

498
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.960 align:center line:-4
If she is Josh Worsten's
ex-girlfriend...

499
00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:07.960 align:center line:-3
maybe Chloe was here because of him?

500
00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.960 align:center line:-4
Jealous? Killed Josh,
come back to hurt Stella as well?

501
00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:15.000 align:center line:-3
No... Hold your horses.

502
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.960 align:center line:-4
Her diary reads that she suspected
he had a girlfriend.

503
00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.960 align:center line:-4
But she's not at all sure
who it was.

504
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.960 align:center line:-4
There is a reference
to this place, though.

505
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.480 align:center line:-4
Apparently, she came on a day trip
from Rosefall.

506
00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.960 align:center line:-3
Loved it.

507
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.960 align:center line:-4
Said it made her feel freer
away from the home.

508
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.640 align:center line:-4
Well, of course it would.
At one with nature.

509
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.960 align:center line:-4
Ma'am. We've got something
on that truck Tracey Jacks spotted

510
00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.800 align:center line:-4
outside of Rosefall.
What?

511
00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.960 align:center line:-4
Well, we've managed to match it
to the one outside of Josh's digs.

512
00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.960 align:center line:-4
Well done, Mark.
So, who's the owner?

513
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.960 align:center line:-3
Will Marsh. Stella's dad.

514
00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.960 align:center line:-4
Please can somebody tell me
what's going on? Is Stella OK?

515
00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.480 align:center line:-4
She's fine, love.
We've got people with her.

516
00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.960 align:center line:-3
So, let's talk about Chloe Spencer.

517
00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:03.960 align:center line:-4
Who?
Now, we need to find her, love.

518
00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.960 align:center line:-4
And she spent last night
at your farm.

519
00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.960 align:center line:-3
So, do you know where she is now?

520
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.960 align:center line:-4
No, of course not. Why would I?
I've never met the girl.

521
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.960 align:center line:-3
OK.

522
00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.960 align:center line:-3
Josh Worsten.

523
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:20.960 align:center line:-4
Now, your truck was parked
near to his digs four days ago.

524
00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.000 align:center line:-4
We know that you talked.
Had an argument.

525
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.320 align:center line:-4
No, not an argument.
No? What'd you talk about then?

526
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.960 align:center line:-3
Well, it, er... it's personal.

527
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.960 align:center line:-4
Well, I don't care, love.
The man's dead.

528
00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.960 align:center line:-4
I know. I know.
I can't believe it. But what...

529
00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.960 align:center line:-4
What's that got to do with me?
Well, you tell us.

530
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.960 align:center line:-4
Because we can place your truck
at Rosefall kids' home

531
00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:40.960 align:center line:-3
on the Sunday night.

532
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.960 align:center line:-3
Same place that Chloe Spencer lived.

533
00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.960 align:center line:-4
And where Josh was killed
that same evening.

534
00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:47.960 align:center line:-4
What?
And there's more.

535
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.480 align:center line:-3
We've got CCTV from the bus

536
00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.320 align:center line:-4
that Josh was on
on the way to Rosefall.

537
00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:56.960 align:center line:-3
And this is your truck, Will.

538
00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.960 align:center line:-4
You trailed it.
You followed him, didn't you?

539
00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.960 align:center line:-4
No, but... but...
You can't think...?

540
00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.960 align:center line:-4
Unless someone else was driving
the vehicle? Stella, maybe?

541
00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.960 align:center line:-3
No. No, it was me.

542
00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.960 align:center line:-4
Right, so shall we go back
to why you were talking to Josh?

543
00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.960 align:center line:-3
Look... I like Josh. OK?

544
00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.960 align:center line:-4
I've known him for years,
since him and Stella were at school.

545
00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.960 align:center line:-4
And... And there was something
I thought he should know.

546
00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.000 align:center line:-3
Oh, aye. What's that?

547
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.960 align:center line:-4
Look, Stella had been talking
about ending things with him...

548
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.960 align:center line:-3
But she hadn't. Not really.

549
00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.160 align:center line:-4
And then, meanwhile,
she'd met another lad.

550
00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.960 align:center line:-4
Oh, so she had
two fellas on the go at once?

551
00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, and...
and I knew that Josh didn't know.

552
00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.960 align:center line:-4
And I knew that he...
he wouldn't be happy about it.

553
00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.960 align:center line:-3
So I tried to tell him.

554
00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.960 align:center line:-3
Well, that's very fatherly of you.

555
00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.960 align:center line:-3
My wife cheated on me, OK?

556
00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.960 align:center line:-4
And then left us
when Stella was young.

557
00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.960 align:center line:-4
So I just think
people should be honest.

558
00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.960 align:center line:-3
Oh, aye, love.

559
00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.960 align:center line:-3
Look...

560
00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.960 align:center line:-4
On Sunday,
Stella had agreed to meet Josh.

561
00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.800 align:center line:-3
But then she decided not to.

562
00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.640 align:center line:-4
She was playing games.
It made me cross.

563
00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.960 align:center line:-4
And I was due in town anyway, so
I thought I would try and catch him.

564
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.960 align:center line:-4
So you followed his bus?
Look...

565
00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.320 align:center line:-3
I never saw Josh that night.

566
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.960 align:center line:-3
And I would never, never hurt him.

567
00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.960 align:center line:-4
I think we'll hold him anyway
and examine his truck.

568
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.000 align:center line:-4
Aye. And check this story
of his ex-wife too.

569
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.960 align:center line:-4
Maybe some people
do get two father figures.

570
00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.960 align:center line:-3
While others, like Chloe, get none.

571
00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.960 align:center line:-4
So, do you think
maybe Will was helping Chloe?

572
00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.960 align:center line:-3
Hid her last night?

573
00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.320 align:center line:-3
I don't know.

574
00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.960 align:center line:-4
I mean, that would've been
hard for him,

575
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.480 align:center line:-3
to conceal him from the daughter.

576
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.960 align:center line:-4
Well, maybe she was in on it too.
Could be.

577
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.960 align:center line:-4
That would explain how Chloe
got from Rosefall to the farm.

578
00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.960 align:center line:-4
We're gonna have to talk
to her again anyway

579
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.960 align:center line:-3
and ask her about this other fella.

580
00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.960 align:center line:-4
Well, let's do
a background check on her.

581
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.160 align:center line:-4
Already done, Ma'am.
It didn't throw up much.

582
00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.960 align:center line:-4
But she was arrested once
for an environmental protest.

583
00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:54.960 align:center line:-4
PHONE RINGS
Hello?

584
00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.960 align:center line:-4
All right, I'll call forensics
and get them onto his truck.

585
00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.320 align:center line:-4
All right, thank you.
That's Paula now, Ma'am. PM's done.

586
00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.960 align:center line:-4
Right, well,
we can tell her ourselves,

587
00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.640 align:center line:-3
and then we'll go see Stella.

588
00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.960 align:center line:-4
Oh, going just as I get here?
Oh, Kenny!

589
00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:13.960 align:center line:-4
HE CHUCKLES
Hiya.

590
00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.800 align:center line:-4
How's the head?
Ah, same as it ever was.

591
00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.960 align:center line:-4
Ah, well, never mind, pet.
HE LAUGHS

592
00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.160 align:center line:-4
I thought you weren't back
until next week?

593
00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.960 align:center line:-4
Ah, well, I heard
you needed some help, Ma'am.

594
00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:28.960 align:center line:-4
I also heard that the IOPC came back
on Lucas Corbridge and his daughter.

595
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.960 align:center line:-4
Aye. They're satisfied
that none of us are culpable.

596
00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.960 align:center line:-4
But don't expect
any special treatment, Kenny.

597
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.480 align:center line:-4
Now, Steph here
will bring you up to speed.

598
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.960 align:center line:-4
Hey, Kenny.
It's great to have you back, mate.

599
00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:42.960 align:center line:-3
Ah. Cheers, bud.

600
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.960 align:center line:-3
CHATTER

601
00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.960 align:center line:-4
Team's back together, then.
Mm.

602
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:55.960 align:center line:-3
Boss, can we, er...?

603
00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.480 align:center line:-4
What?
HE SIGHS

604
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.640 align:center line:-3
Can we clear the air?

605
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.960 align:center line:-3
Well, go on, then.

606
00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.480 align:center line:-4
What I said after Kenny was hurt...
You know I didn't mean it.

607
00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.960 align:center line:-4
Ah. But there was some truth in it,
wasn't there, Joe?

608
00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.960 align:center line:-4
You thought you were about to spread
your wings without me on your back.

609
00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.960 align:center line:-4
Everything useful I learnt
about policing, I learnt from you.

610
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.960 align:center line:-3
And you were right about my dad.

611
00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.320 align:center line:-4
And me needing to sort my head out
after he died.

612
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:31.960 align:center line:-4
And are you?
Yes. I think so.

613
00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:33.960 align:center line:-3
Good.

614
00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.960 align:center line:-3
Your time will come, Joe. Trust me.

615
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.960 align:center line:-4
So? What did you decide in the end?
About the promotion?

616
00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.640 align:center line:-3
So that's what this is about.

617
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.960 align:center line:-4
Thought you wanted
to talk about the case.

618
00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.960 align:center line:-4
Paula. Well, you've taken your time
on this one.

619
00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.960 align:center line:-4
I'd say I've been
exceptionally fast,

620
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.960 align:center line:-4
considering you keep sending us to
different sites round the country.

621
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, and I've got a vehicle
for you to look at.

622
00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.960 align:center line:-4
But first things first.
What have you got?

623
00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.960 align:center line:-3
Cause of death was as we said.

624
00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.960 align:center line:-4
Deceased was fit and healthy
otherwise. No alcohol, no drugs.

625
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.960 align:center line:-4
Students these days...
The carotid artery was nicked?

626
00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.800 align:center line:-4
Hence why there was so much
blood spatter at the Rosefall site.

627
00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.960 align:center line:-4
So, whoever did it,
they'd be covered?

628
00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:26.960 align:center line:-3
More than likely.

629
00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.960 align:center line:-4
And the knife?
About four inches long.

630
00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.960 align:center line:-4
Poor quality steel. An old,
cheap kitchen knife, I think.

631
00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:33.960 align:center line:-3
Well, how can you tell that?

632
00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:37.320 align:center line:-4
Because when I probed
the neck wound, I discovered this.

633
00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.960 align:center line:-4
And this belongs to the knife?
Mm-hm.

634
00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.800 align:center line:-3
The extreme tip of it...

635
00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.960 align:center line:-4
..caught on the collarbone
and broke off.

636
00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:47.960 align:center line:-3
That must've been hard to spot.

637
00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.960 align:center line:-4
Just as well you have
an extraordinary pathologist.

638
00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, there's no need
to over-egg it.

639
00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.960 align:center line:-3
But this is not bad.

640
00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.960 align:center line:-4
No idea where the rest
of the knife is, though?

641
00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.960 align:center line:-4
Could've been disposed of anywhere
between Rosefall and Ghyllstead.

642
00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.000 align:center line:-3
SHE TUTS

643
00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.960 align:center line:-3
Any evidence of who moved the body?

644
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.960 align:center line:-4
Like I said, it was hard to pull
much from the Ghyllstead scene.

645
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.960 align:center line:-4
But there were some patches of soil
at the Rosefall murder site. Here.

646
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.960 align:center line:-4
Partial shoe prints from
close to where the deceased lay.

647
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.800 align:center line:-4
Maybe made as someone moved the
body, thanks to the extra weight.

648
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.960 align:center line:-4
So, this may or may not have been
the person who killed him. Exactly.

649
00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.960 align:center line:-4
Appears to be a size nine.
So not Chloe, then.

650
00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.960 align:center line:-4
Well, it still doesn't prove
that she wasn't involved.

651
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.960 align:center line:-3
We don't know why she was running.

652
00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.000 align:center line:-3
OK, thank you, Paula.

653
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.960 align:center line:-4
And now I've got a truck on a farm
I need you to check over.

654
00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.640 align:center line:-3
Mark will text you the details.

655
00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.960 align:center line:-3
OK.

656
00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.960 align:center line:-4
What's going on?
When are you releasing Dad?

657
00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.960 align:center line:-4
Well, let's talk about Josh Worsten
for now, pet.

658
00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:07.160 align:center line:-4
Josh... I've only just found out
he's dead.

659
00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.960 align:center line:-4
Well, you said you weren't together
any more.

660
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, that's right.
Are you sure?

661
00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.960 align:center line:-4
Only he called you
and texted several times.

662
00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:16.960 align:center line:-3
On Sunday, for example.

663
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.480 align:center line:-4
I told you.
We'd said we might meet in town.

664
00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.960 align:center line:-3
I didn't go in the end.

665
00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:22.960 align:center line:-3
Your dad did.

666
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.320 align:center line:-4
What?
Oh, aye.

667
00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.960 align:center line:-3
Your dad followed him from town

668
00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.960 align:center line:-4
all the way
to where Josh was killed.

669
00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.960 align:center line:-4
Why would Dad follow Josh?
Well, you tell me, pet.

670
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.960 align:center line:-4
Was Josh harassing you,
and you wanted him to stop?

671
00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.960 align:center line:-4
Is that it?
No, no, it wasn't...

672
00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:42.960 align:center line:-3
I mean...

673
00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.960 align:center line:-4
We weren't together,
properly. But...

674
00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:51.960 align:center line:-4
And your dad said you hadn't
properly split up from him, either.

675
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.960 align:center line:-4
He also said you had
another fella in tow.

676
00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:57.960 align:center line:-3
What's his name?

677
00:39:58.960 --> 00:39:59.960 align:center line:-3
STELLA SIGHS

678
00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.160 align:center line:-3
What's his name?

679
00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.960 align:center line:-3
Craig. Craig Simpson.

680
00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.960 align:center line:-3
And did this Craig know about Josh?

681
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.960 align:center line:-4
No. Look, I did try
to split with Josh.

682
00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.320 align:center line:-4
But he clung on.
Always trying to impress me.

683
00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.960 align:center line:-3
And how'd he do that?

684
00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.960 align:center line:-3
Well, like, the last few months, er,

685
00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.960 align:center line:-4
he went on about this project
he was working on.

686
00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:22.960 align:center line:-4
Said I'd love it,
that it'd make a difference.

687
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.960 align:center line:-3
What project's that?

688
00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:25.960 align:center line:-3
He didn't say.

689
00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.960 align:center line:-4
Then he went on about volunteering
at that kids' home.

690
00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.960 align:center line:-3
And was that to impress you, too?

691
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.960 align:center line:-4
Think he surprised himself
about how much he enjoyed it.

692
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.960 align:center line:-4
Although he'd a big fight
with the manager there. What?

693
00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.800 align:center line:-3
He had a fight with Dave Limbal?

694
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.960 align:center line:-4
So he's taken a few days off?
It's been very stressful.

695
00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:49.960 align:center line:-4
Aye, for the children in his care.
Course.

696
00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.800 align:center line:-4
But he gets the pressure from above
as well as below.

697
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.960 align:center line:-3
What, from the owners of this place?

698
00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:58.960 align:center line:-4
How do you think it looks
having police here?

699
00:40:58.960 --> 00:40:59.960 align:center line:-3
Someone murdered?

700
00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.960 align:center line:-3
How did Dave and Josh get on?

701
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.960 align:center line:-4
Fine. They never saw
each other much.

702
00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:10.960 align:center line:-4
Josh and Noah often went
into Longwater or to the cinema.

703
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.960 align:center line:-3
Cos we were told they'd had a fight.

704
00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.640 align:center line:-3
No. Not that I ever saw.

705
00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:21.960 align:center line:-4
Is there a way of leaving the house
avoiding the cameras?

706
00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:26.160 align:center line:-4
Yeah, why? You think Dave went
sneaking out to kill him?

707
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.320 align:center line:-3
And did he?

708
00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:31.960 align:center line:-4
Avoiding CCTV cameras
isn't Dave's MO.

709
00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:32.960 align:center line:-3
He's all for the rules.

710
00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.960 align:center line:-4
So all the kids were here
watching a film on Sunday night,

711
00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:37.960 align:center line:-3
apart from Chloe and him?

712
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, except when they went
to the loo, or...

713
00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.960 align:center line:-3
Or having a fag break.

714
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.480 align:center line:-4
Stop.
What?

715
00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.320 align:center line:-4
Put that knife down.
Why? What is it?

716
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.320 align:center line:-4
Where'd you get that from?
The knife?

717
00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.480 align:center line:-3
From here, the kitchen.

718
00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.960 align:center line:-4
Has it been missing?
What? Why?

719
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.960 align:center line:-4
Does that look like
a murder weapon to you?

720
00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.960 align:center line:-3
The tip's broken off.

721
00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.960 align:center line:-4
So someone put it back
after our teams left? But who?

722
00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.960 align:center line:-4
Well, not Chloe.
She's not been back.

723
00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:20.000 align:center line:-4
So she didn't kill Josh.
But maybe she saw who did.

724
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.960 align:center line:-4
And that's why she's run.
She's scared.

725
00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:27.960 align:center line:-4
But we do know someone
who does have access here

726
00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.960 align:center line:-3
and who'd had a fight with Josh.

727
00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:31.960 align:center line:-3
Dave Limbal.

728
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.960 align:center line:-4
Oh, we found this
in the kitchen at Rosefall,

729
00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.960 align:center line:-4
and we believe it to be
our murder weapon.

730
00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.960 align:center line:-4
But somebody has scrubbed it clean
and returned it.

731
00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.000 align:center line:-3
Now, was that you, Dave?

732
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.800 align:center line:-3
DAVE SCOFFS

733
00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:56.960 align:center line:-3
What are you saying?

734
00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.800 align:center line:-3
Well, you think I killed Josh?

735
00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.960 align:center line:-4
Well, we know
you had a beef with him.

736
00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.960 align:center line:-4
And we found size nine shoe prints
where he was killed.

737
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:06.960 align:center line:-4
You're a size nine,
aren't you, Dave?

738
00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.960 align:center line:-3
Well, so are millions of people.

739
00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.960 align:center line:-4
Look, I never had a problem
with Josh.

740
00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.960 align:center line:-3
So, you didn't argue with him?

741
00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.960 align:center line:-4
Well, there was one time
we had words.

742
00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.000 align:center line:-3
Did you? Why?

743
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.960 align:center line:-3
Because he was a posh boy

744
00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:24.640 align:center line:-4
with lots of opinions about how
a place like Rosefall should be ran

745
00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.960 align:center line:-4
but with...
with very little actual experience.

746
00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:31.160 align:center line:-3
So, how's this for a scenario?

747
00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.960 align:center line:-4
While everyone's squirrelled away
watching that film on Sunday night,

748
00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:38.960 align:center line:-4
you're in your office alone
doing your paperwork,

749
00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.960 align:center line:-3
and you nip outside. Mm?

750
00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.960 align:center line:-3
Being a manager of the place,

751
00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.960 align:center line:-4
you know how to avoid
those CCTV cameras.

752
00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:50.480 align:center line:-4
You see Josh, you argue,
and it escalates.

753
00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.960 align:center line:-4
Did Chloe see it happen?
Is that why she ran?

754
00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:54.960 align:center line:-3
Do you know where she is, Dave?

755
00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.960 align:center line:-3
Did you hurt her, Mr Limbal?

756
00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.960 align:center line:-3
I would never hurt any of our kids.

757
00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.960 align:center line:-4
I've only ever done my best
for them.

758
00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:06.960 align:center line:-4
Well, Josh wasn't one of your kids,
was he, love? So did you hurt him?

759
00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.960 align:center line:-3
No.

760
00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:16.960 align:center line:-3
OK, listen up.

761
00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:20.960 align:center line:-4
I want to dig into Dave Limbal.
Bank accounts, phone logs.

762
00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, I'll get onto his mobile
and the landline at the care home.

763
00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.800 align:center line:-4
Right. Now, Kenny,
do you feel up to a little trip?

764
00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:28.960 align:center line:-3
Raring, Ma'am.

765
00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.960 align:center line:-4
I want the CCTV at Rosefall
checked again.

766
00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.960 align:center line:-4
Now, I reckon there's a way
of avoiding those cameras.

767
00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.960 align:center line:-4
I'll head there now.
A couple of things from forensics.

768
00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:38.960 align:center line:-3
The knife you found was scrubbed,

769
00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:41.480 align:center line:-4
but there were residual blood traces
on the blade housing.

770
00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:44.000 align:center line:-4
Ah, not what you'd want
for chopping your veggies, eh?

771
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.640 align:center line:-3
Was it Josh's blood?

772
00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.960 align:center line:-4
Confirming now, but I've said
we need to know as soon as.

773
00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.960 align:center line:-4
So, what was the other thing
from Paula?

774
00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.960 align:center line:-4
Result from Will Marsh's
pick-up truck.

775
00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.960 align:center line:-4
There's zero evidence
to suggest it was used

776
00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:55.960 align:center line:-3
to transport Josh's body.

777
00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.960 align:center line:-3
Oh, and he's also got size 11 feet.

778
00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.960 align:center line:-4
Well, I now want forensics
on Dave Limbal's motor.

779
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:05.480 align:center line:-4
Wasn't at Rosefall on Sunday.
Well, maybe he fetched it.

780
00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.960 align:center line:-4
I already mentioned
his car to Paula.

781
00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:09.960 align:center line:-4
She suggested we just test
every vehicle in the north-east.

782
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.960 align:center line:-3
Oh! Well, if she's offering!

783
00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:15.800 align:center line:-4
Now, come on, press on,
every avenue.

784
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:16.960 align:center line:-3
And you can buy me coffee.

785
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.160 align:center line:-3
JOE SIGHS

786
00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.160 align:center line:-4
You know,
the team are working really hard.

787
00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.960 align:center line:-3
Well, so they should be.

788
00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.160 align:center line:-4
There's a young man dead
and a young lass missing.

789
00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:38.960 align:center line:-3
You know what I mean.

790
00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.960 align:center line:-4
It just feels like
you're pushing them on this one.

791
00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:42.960 align:center line:-3
Well, there's a level, Joe,

792
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.960 align:center line:-4
and my team are quite capable
of staying above it.

793
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.960 align:center line:-4
And they all know
what I expect of them.

794
00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.960 align:center line:-3
Might need reminding sometimes.

795
00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:55.960 align:center line:-3
Now, Chloe.

796
00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.640 align:center line:-4
If the man who's supposed
to be keeping her safe killed Josh,

797
00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.960 align:center line:-3
and she saw it...

798
00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.640 align:center line:-3
No wonder she ran, is still running.

799
00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:07.480 align:center line:-3
But why didn't she come to us?

800
00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.960 align:center line:-3
Well, she'll have trust issues.

801
00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.160 align:center line:-3
Aye, you can see from her diary

802
00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.960 align:center line:-4
she felt let down
by a long list of adults,

803
00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.160 align:center line:-3
justified or not.

804
00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:17.960 align:center line:-4
And we'll get lumped in
with social services and the rest.

805
00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:20.960 align:center line:-4
"The authorities."
So who can she trust?

806
00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.960 align:center line:-4
You can see from that diary
the lass is strong.

807
00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:26.960 align:center line:-3
But she had been sinking.

808
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.800 align:center line:-3
And she still chose to fight.

809
00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.000 align:center line:-4
You feel a real connection to her,
don't you?

810
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.960 align:center line:-4
You must be pleased that she's not
our prime suspect any more, then?

811
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.960 align:center line:-4
PHONE RINGS
I never really thought she was.

812
00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:40.320 align:center line:-3
Kenny? You at Rosefall?

813
00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:42.960 align:center line:-3
You want me to...?

814
00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.960 align:center line:-3
Who's gone missing now?

815
00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.960 align:center line:-3
He must've left overnight.

816
00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.960 align:center line:-4
KENNY: Any family
that he would run to?

817
00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.800 align:center line:-3
Brad's in care. We're his family.

818
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.960 align:center line:-3
Well, how about mates?

819
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:59.000 align:center line:-4
They were forever rotating.
Endless fallouts and dramas.

820
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.640 align:center line:-3
Now, you're sure he has gone, love?

821
00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:04.320 align:center line:-4
He's not gonna waltz in in a minute,
hungry for his lunch?

822
00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.960 align:center line:-4
I went to his room
to put some washing away.

823
00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:09.480 align:center line:-3
His wardrobe's emptied.

824
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.960 align:center line:-3
Clean washing?

825
00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:14.960 align:center line:-4
There was a load of his stuff
in the machine.

826
00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:15.960 align:center line:-3
He must've put it on.

827
00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:20.160 align:center line:-4
And that's normal, is it?
Young lad doing his own washing?

828
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.960 align:center line:-4
No, normally I have to rescue
everything from the floor.

829
00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.960 align:center line:-3
This film on Sunday...

830
00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:34.960 align:center line:-4
You said some of the kids took
a loo break or nipped out for a fag.

831
00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.960 align:center line:-3
Now, is this lad the one who smokes?

832
00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:41.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah.
So, how long were his fag breaks?

833
00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:45.960 align:center line:-3
I don't know. Not long.

834
00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.960 align:center line:-4
He normally just smokes
out the back door.

835
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:51.960 align:center line:-3
Could one of them have been longer?

836
00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:53.960 align:center line:-3
Don't know.

837
00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:58.960 align:center line:-3
Hang on.

838
00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.000 align:center line:-3
What?

839
00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:04.960 align:center line:-3
In the middle of the movie...

840
00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.960 align:center line:-3
..he reappeared in a onesie.

841
00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.800 align:center line:-3
Comfier than his jeans, he said.

842
00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.960 align:center line:-3
Kenny, seal off his room

843
00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.960 align:center line:-4
and get forensics
onto that washed laundry.

844
00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.960 align:center line:-4
Yes, Ma'am.
And then check CCTV.

845
00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.960 align:center line:-4
See if you can see the lad leaving.
And if we can't?

846
00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:25.960 align:center line:-4
Well, then there IS a way to avoid
those cameras, and that lad knew it.

847
00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:34.800 align:center line:-4
Unbelievable. Two kids missing.
Maybe we spooked the lad.

848
00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.960 align:center line:-4
Or perhaps he always intended
to scarper.

849
00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:41.960 align:center line:-4
So you're saying this 17-year-old
killed Josh? Not Dave Limbal?

850
00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:44.480 align:center line:-3
No... Well, we don't know yet.

851
00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.640 align:center line:-4
But I'll lay money
this lad is involved somehow.

852
00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.960 align:center line:-4
Ma'am, something's come in on Chloe.
Possible sighting.

853
00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.800 align:center line:-3
What? Where?

854
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:53.960 align:center line:-3
Er, reported this afternoon.

855
00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.480 align:center line:-4
A man spotted a girl
matching Chloe's description

856
00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.960 align:center line:-3
in Cullenborough, Delancey Lane.

857
00:48:58.960 --> 00:48:59.960 align:center line:-3
Cullenborough?

858
00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:04.960 align:center line:-4
Delancey Lane is right next
to the library, isn't it?

859
00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.960 align:center line:-4
I think I should take that,
don't you, pet?

860
00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:33.960 align:center line:-4
So you and her stayed close,
whatever they thought at school?

861
00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:35.960 align:center line:-4
She's been my best friend
since primary.

862
00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:38.960 align:center line:-4
I wasn't gonna betray her...
whatever Dad told me to do.

863
00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.320 align:center line:-3
So, how did she first get in touch?

864
00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.960 align:center line:-3
She rang me from a phone box.

865
00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:49.960 align:center line:-4
Now, was this before or after
you talked to me?

866
00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.480 align:center line:-4
I'm sorry, OK?
She sounded desperate.

867
00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:56.960 align:center line:-4
So I-I smuggled some clothes to her.
A bit of money, a sleeping bag.

868
00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:59.960 align:center line:-4
So, this was the first day
she went missing?

869
00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.960 align:center line:-3
Have you met her at all?

870
00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.960 align:center line:-4
No, we've, erm, left notes
for each other this way.

871
00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.960 align:center line:-3
For safety, she said.

872
00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:11.960 align:center line:-4
Well, no-one's gonna be
borrowing that any time soon.

873
00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:16.160 align:center line:-3
So clever. Very Enid Blyton.

874
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.960 align:center line:-3
"I need to move on. New area.

875
00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.640 align:center line:-4
"Thanks for everything, girl.
Love you."

876
00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:25.640 align:center line:-3
So, what's her plan?

877
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:28.960 align:center line:-4
She gonna disappear completely?
Start a new life?

878
00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.960 align:center line:-4
No, she...
Well, she would have said goodbye.

879
00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:41.960 align:center line:-4
I'm so sorry, OK. She made me
promise not to tell anyone. What?

880
00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:45.960 align:center line:-4
She's just scared cos she thinks
that someone's after her. Well, who?

881
00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:51.960 align:center line:-4
Did she ever mention
a Bradley Russell?

882
00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.960 align:center line:-3
A lad at the same home as her?

883
00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.640 align:center line:-4
Yeah. Yeah, she...
she didn't like him.

884
00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:02.960 align:center line:-4
She contacts you again,
you let me know immediately.

885
00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.960 align:center line:-4
There was a cottage
she talked about.

886
00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.960 align:center line:-4
Her grandparents owned it.
Chloe went when she was younger.

887
00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:11.960 align:center line:-3
Yeah, where was that?

888
00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:14.960 align:center line:-3
Somewhere called Ghyllstead?

889
00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.960 align:center line:-4
So, you've not seen or heard
from Chloe?

890
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.960 align:center line:-3
PAM: No, not for over a year.

891
00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.960 align:center line:-4
And you were contacted
about taking her in

892
00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:37.960 align:center line:-3
when her mam was sectioned?

893
00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:42.960 align:center line:-4
Hey, look,
there's no judgement here, pet.

894
00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:46.960 align:center line:-4
That's no easy task,
taking on a troubled teenager.

895
00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:51.640 align:center line:-4
Aye, well...
And the age we are as well.

896
00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:54.960 align:center line:-4
Right, you have a property
in Ghyllstead.

897
00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.320 align:center line:-3
Is that a holiday home?

898
00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:59.960 align:center line:-4
Aye, it's a bit grand
to call it that.

899
00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.800 align:center line:-3
Cragside Cottage. We rarely go.

900
00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.960 align:center line:-4
HE CLEARS THROAT
It's a wee bit in need of repair.

901
00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:07.960 align:center line:-3
Yeah, and has Chloe ever been there?

902
00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.960 align:center line:-4
As a child.
For a few weeks every summer.

903
00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:13.960 align:center line:-3
Aye, she adored it there.

904
00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.960 align:center line:-4
She's, er...
She's a country girl at heart.

905
00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.960 align:center line:-3
Ah, I got that feeling.

906
00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.960 align:center line:-4
She'd always make us join in
this, er...

907
00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:21.960 align:center line:-3
this daft tradition.

908
00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.960 align:center line:-3
What was it called?

909
00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.960 align:center line:-4
Oh, the Witch Hunt.
That was it, yeah.

910
00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.960 align:center line:-3
Daft, but she loved it.

911
00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:29.960 align:center line:-4
She had a little friend
in the village.

912
00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:31.320 align:center line:-3
Thick as thieves, they were.

913
00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:33.960 align:center line:-3
Is that Alice, by any chance?

914
00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:37.960 align:center line:-4
Aye, Alice. Alice Hartford.
That's right. How do you know that?

915
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:41.960 align:center line:-4
Er... Oh, she just mentioned
an Alice in her diary, love.

916
00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:45.000 align:center line:-4
But you can't think
she's gone there?

917
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.960 align:center line:-4
I mean, she hasn't been there
for years,

918
00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:49.000 align:center line:-4
and Ghyllstead,
it's so out of the way.

919
00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.960 align:center line:-4
Do you think we could get access
to the cottage?

920
00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:54.960 align:center line:-4
Yes, of course.
I'll dig out some keys.

921
00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:59.320 align:center line:-4
I can understand
the lass wanting to get away.

922
00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.960 align:center line:-4
At least she'll be able
to breathe out here.

923
00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.960 align:center line:-3
KEYS JANGLE

924
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.320 align:center line:-3
WHISPERS: It's still warm.

925
00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:13.160 align:center line:-3
Joe? She's up here.

926
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:19.960 align:center line:-4
Hey, it's all right, Chloe, love.
It's all right, p...

927
00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:23.800 align:center line:-3
Oh, no. Please, no.

928
00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:30.960 align:center line:-3
It's Bradley Russell!

929
00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.800 align:center line:-4
PAULA: Any upper limits on
the scenes this case will generate?

930
00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:44.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, well,
just think of the overtime, pet.

931
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:46.960 align:center line:-4
Now, the clothes you sent us
from the kids' home...

932
00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:47.960 align:center line:-3
Yeah, belonging to this lad.

933
00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:50.960 align:center line:-3
Er, we got nothing from the hoodie.

934
00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:53.000 align:center line:-4
The hot wash would've destroyed
crucial evidence.

935
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.960 align:center line:-4
But denim yields
the highest DNA recovery rate

936
00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:56.960 align:center line:-3
in all washing methods.

937
00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:59.960 align:center line:-4
And? Er, we found traces
of Josh Worsten's blood.

938
00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:03.960 align:center line:-4
Meaning Bradley Russell
is our killer? Mm-hm.

939
00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.960 align:center line:-3
But now he's lying dead in there.

940
00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.800 align:center line:-3
We'll pull prints from inside,

941
00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:10.960 align:center line:-4
but the body showed no sign
of external injury.

942
00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:12.640 align:center line:-3
Did he have a history of drug use?

943
00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:16.960 align:center line:-4
Well, one time, I think,
but we understood he was now clean.

944
00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.960 align:center line:-3
There was a used syringe by him.

945
00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.960 align:center line:-4
And the constricted pupils
and the cyanosis

946
00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.960 align:center line:-3
suggest an accidental overdose.

947
00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:24.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, well,
I want that heroin tested.

948
00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.960 align:center line:-4
Course you do.
I'll keep you updated, then.

949
00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:34.320 align:center line:-3
Mark and Steph are en route.

950
00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:37.000 align:center line:-4
Young lad in care
involved in a murder.

951
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.960 align:center line:-3
Who'd question an overdose?

952
00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:41.160 align:center line:-4
You think we should?
Aye, I do.

953
00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:45.960 align:center line:-4
It's all... too tidy.
Well, not to me.

954
00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:47.960 align:center line:-4
We still don't know what's going on
with Dave Limbal.

955
00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.960 align:center line:-4
Aye. We found anything,
digging into him?

956
00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:53.800 align:center line:-4
Steph's on his phone logs.
There's nothing jumping out.

957
00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:54.960 align:center line:-4
His finances show
he was scraping by.

958
00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:58.960 align:center line:-4
Not flush, but nothing to flag.
What was Brad doing here?

959
00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.960 align:center line:-3
Somewhere Chloe Spencer knew.

960
00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:05.960 align:center line:-4
Aye, well, maybe we were supposed
to think she was involved.

961
00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:08.960 align:center line:-3
And maybe that's why Josh was taken

962
00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.960 align:center line:-4
to the Dark Wives
in the first place,

963
00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:11.960 align:center line:-3
to implicate her.

964
00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:15.000 align:center line:-3
We need a full debrief.

965
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.320 align:center line:-4
Now, there's a pub I know
in the village.

966
00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:18.960 align:center line:-3
Call Steph and tell her.

967
00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:31.960 align:center line:-4
So, why exactly is your name
on the pub?

968
00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:34.160 align:center line:-3
Oh, mystery to me.

969
00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:35.960 align:center line:-3
My dad thought it was hilarious.

970
00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.960 align:center line:-4
Every time they tried
to kick him out,

971
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.960 align:center line:-3
he'd claim a stake in the place.

972
00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:41.160 align:center line:-3
SHE CHUCKLES

973
00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:43.960 align:center line:-3
I hope Steph and Mark find it.

974
00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:49.320 align:center line:-4
MA LAUGHS
Never changes.

975
00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:52.960 align:center line:-3
Stone me! You're still here.

976
00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:58.480 align:center line:-4
Well, well, well. Vera Stanhope?
Jimmy said he'd seen you.

977
00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:59.960 align:center line:-3
VERA GROANS

978
00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:02.960 align:center line:-4
That's Jimmy Hebble,
the birder who found Josh.

979
00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:06.320 align:center line:-4
Ma's Jimmy's sister.
This is Joe Ashworth, my colleague.

980
00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:08.960 align:center line:-4
And you're up at that cottage now,
are you? With another body?

981
00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:11.960 align:center line:-4
Oh, hey, news travels fast
in Ghyllstead.

982
00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:14.960 align:center line:-4
Ah, any chance we can use
your side room, Ma?

983
00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.960 align:center line:-4
Got a couple more colleagues
turning up.

984
00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.960 align:center line:-3
Sure. No problem.

985
00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.960 align:center line:-4
So the forensics
on the lad's laundry

986
00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:22.960 align:center line:-3
means that he killed Josh. Right?

987
00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.960 align:center line:-4
Well, he was certainly present.
Covered in blood splatter.

988
00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.960 align:center line:-4
But he couldn't have
brought the body

989
00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:29.960 align:center line:-3
all the way out here on his own.

990
00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:33.960 align:center line:-4
Or at all. He wasn't away
from Rosefall long enough on Sunday.

991
00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:35.800 align:center line:-4
And he'd need a car.
Mm.

992
00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:37.960 align:center line:-4
Which means we're still not at
the bottom of Josh Worsten's murder

993
00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:40.320 align:center line:-4
or who killed Bradley Russell,
if he was killed.

994
00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:42.960 align:center line:-3
Yeah, or where Chloe is.

995
00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:44.960 align:center line:-3
Only reason we're in Ghyllstead,

996
00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:47.960 align:center line:-4
it's cos we thought she'd be
in that cottage.

997
00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:50.960 align:center line:-4
Well, maybe she did come here?
Could she have killed the lad?

998
00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:54.320 align:center line:-4
Yeah. Maybe he tried to silence her,
and she got to him first?

999
00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:57.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, well, I can see
where you're coming from. But...

1000
00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:59.960 align:center line:-4
Does that fit with the way
he was killed?

1001
00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:05.960 align:center line:-4
Someone's covering their tracks,
but I don't think it's her.

1002
00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:07.960 align:center line:-3
And Dave Limbal's in the clear.

1003
00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:09.960 align:center line:-4
He might've had a hand
in Josh Worsten's death,

1004
00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:12.960 align:center line:-4
but he couldn't have killed
this lad. He's in custody.

1005
00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:15.320 align:center line:-3
But one thing's clear.

1006
00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.960 align:center line:-3
If that lad was murdered,

1007
00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:20.960 align:center line:-4
Chloe's right to be afraid,
wherever she is,

1008
00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.960 align:center line:-4
because they're gonna be
after her next.

1009
00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:27.960 align:center line:-4
So, we might not have had much luck
finding a car last time.

1010
00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:31.160 align:center line:-4
But Cragside Cottage is less remote
than those Dark Wives stones,

1011
00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.960 align:center line:-3
so come on, let's get cracking.

1012
00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:37.960 align:center line:-3
Thanks for the room, Ma.

1013
00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:41.800 align:center line:-4
So, who's playing the Witch
this year?

1014
00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:43.960 align:center line:-4
Me. Unless you're looking
to step up?

1015
00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.960 align:center line:-3
Can we let it go ahead?

1016
00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:47.960 align:center line:-3
What? Cancel the Witch Hunt?

1017
00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:52.960 align:center line:-4
Ah, we'll not stop it, Joe.
Anyway, it's confined to a set area.

1018
00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:55.960 align:center line:-4
Now, you might have heard we've been
looking for a missing lass?

1019
00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:58.160 align:center line:-4
Aye. The police lad came round
the other day asking.

1020
00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:01.960 align:center line:-4
What was her name?
Chloe Spencer.

1021
00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:06.960 align:center line:-3
Ah! Yeah, yeah, I know her.

1022
00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:10.960 align:center line:-4
But I haven't seen her for a while.
I told your officer that.

1023
00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.480 align:center line:-4
But they were in the village
a few months back.

1024
00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:16.960 align:center line:-4
Who was?
Her and her granddad.

1025
00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:23.960 align:center line:-4
Well, Annie told us
Chloe hadn't been here for years.

1026
00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:27.960 align:center line:-4
And he didn't deny it.
He lied. So, is he hiding her now?

1027
00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:30.960 align:center line:-3
One more thing, love.

1028
00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:34.640 align:center line:-4
Is there a lass in the village
called Alice Hartford?

1029
00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.800 align:center line:-3
Harry Hartford's girl, aye.

1030
00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:39.960 align:center line:-4
OK, so I'll go see these
grandparents again in the morning.

1031
00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.960 align:center line:-4
Are you OK to stay here
and talk to this Alice?

1032
00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:43.960 align:center line:-4
Well, shouldn't we try
and find her tonight?

1033
00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:48.960 align:center line:-4
Mm. I'd be more interested to
find out where she goes first thing.

1034
00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:51.960 align:center line:-4
Might lead you to something
or someone.

1035
00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:53.800 align:center line:-4
You OK with that?
Aye, all right.

1036
00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:55.960 align:center line:-3
Yeah. Well, thanks, Ma.

1037
00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:57.960 align:center line:-4
Escaping without saying hi
to Jimmy again?

1038
00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.000 align:center line:-4
Ah, well,
it's not a social call, pet.

1039
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.960 align:center line:-4
In the middle
of a murder investigation.

1040
01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.960 align:center line:-3
So... what's the story there?

1041
01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:11.960 align:center line:-4
Vera's dad, Hector,
he'd a soft spot for our Jimmy.

1042
01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:12.960 align:center line:-3
Pair of them'd go off birding.

1043
01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:16.960 align:center line:-3
My old dad said Vera felt left out.

1044
01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.960 align:center line:-4
Thought Hector
would've loved her more

1045
01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:19.960 align:center line:-3
if she'd been a boy and a birder.

1046
01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.960 align:center line:-4
JIMMY: I knew I'd seen you
the other day.

1047
01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.960 align:center line:-3
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

1048
01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:29.960 align:center line:-4
I promised I'd help Marie
plot her route

1049
01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.960 align:center line:-3
for the Witch Hunt tomorrow.

1050
01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.800 align:center line:-3
You here because of this new body?

1051
01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:37.160 align:center line:-4
Well, at least it wasn't you
who found this one.

1052
01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.800 align:center line:-4
Were you out yesterday?
Mm-hm.

1053
01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.960 align:center line:-3
See anyone near Cragside Cottage?

1054
01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:48.960 align:center line:-4
Ah... There was a car by the path
you'd need for the cottage. Yeah?

1055
01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.000 align:center line:-3
Can you describe it?

1056
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.960 align:center line:-4
Er... Large four-by-four.
Black or dark blue, maybe.

1057
01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.960 align:center line:-3
With those tinted windows.

1058
01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.960 align:center line:-4
It seemed too swish
for another bird-watcher.

1059
01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.960 align:center line:-4
I should've had a squiz
through the binoculars.

1060
01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.960 align:center line:-3
Ah, well, I wish you had.

1061
01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.160 align:center line:-4
You know, I still use the ones
your dad gave me sometimes.

1062
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.160 align:center line:-4
You never do.
I do.

1063
01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:15.960 align:center line:-3
Never forget him coming home

1064
01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.960 align:center line:-4
raving about this lad
who'd spotted a dusky thrush.

1065
01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:22.320 align:center line:-3
First he'd seen in the UK.

1066
01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.960 align:center line:-4
Brilliant naturalist, Hector.
Aye.

1067
01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.960 align:center line:-4
Shame about the poaching,
thieving eggs,

1068
01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:30.320 align:center line:-3
trading raptors taken from the wild.

1069
01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.960 align:center line:-4
You know I'm a gamekeeper now?
Ah, I heard.

1070
01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.160 align:center line:-4
So if Dad was still around,
you'd be after him.

1071
01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.000 align:center line:-4
HE CHUCKLES
Aye, I suppose you might be, too.

1072
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, well, I doubt he'd be pleased
about you becoming a gamekeeper,

1073
01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.960 align:center line:-4
any more than he was
about me becoming a copper.

1074
01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:47.960 align:center line:-3
Aye. You had it tough, but...

1075
01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.960 align:center line:-4
he'd have made
a great gamekeeper himself.

1076
01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.960 align:center line:-4
SHE CHUCKLES
No, I'm serious.

1077
01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.960 align:center line:-4
Out in nature, no two days alike.
It's a gift.

1078
01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.960 align:center line:-3
Ah, you're not wrong there, Jimmy.

1079
01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.480 align:center line:-3
Night, Vera.

1080
01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.960 align:center line:-3
Take care.

1081
01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.480 align:center line:-4
HECTOR: Shall I get you
another blanket?

1082
01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.960 align:center line:-4
Are you warm enough, love?
VERA: Aye. The fire's lovely.

1083
01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:25.960 align:center line:-3
Nearly ready?

1084
01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.960 align:center line:-4
You know where this rabbit meat
came from, lass?

1085
01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:29.960 align:center line:-4
Do I want to?
HECTOR SMIRKS

1086
01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:33.640 align:center line:-4
No, won't help us catch anything
but quite happy to eat the rewards.

1087
01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:34.960 align:center line:-3
That about the size of it?

1088
01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.960 align:center line:-3
See, the problem is, Dad...

1089
01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.480 align:center line:-3
..it just smells too good.

1090
01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.960 align:center line:-3
HE LAUGHS

1091
01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:43.960 align:center line:-3
LAUGHTER ECHOES

1092
01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:48.320 align:center line:-4
DOOR OPENS,
LAUGHTER

1093
01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.480 align:center line:-4
DOOR OPENS,
CLOSES

1094
01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.960 align:center line:-4
Oh, here again, are you?
Haven't you got a home to go to?

1095
01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.000 align:center line:-3
You partial to a sausage?

1096
01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.960 align:center line:-3
Ooh. Hang on.

1097
01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:19.960 align:center line:-3
Bump!

1098
01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.960 align:center line:-4
SHE LAUGHS
Boop!

1099
01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.960 align:center line:-4
Simple life for you, isn't it?
No big decisions.

1100
01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:28.000 align:center line:-3
SHE CHUCKLES

1101
01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:43.960 align:center line:-4
Morning, Ma'am.
Oh, I'm not stopping, Kenny.

1102
01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.960 align:center line:-3
I'm heading back to Ghyllstead.

1103
01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.960 align:center line:-4
Just checking up on me, were you?
SHE CHUCKLES

1104
01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.320 align:center line:-3
Ma'am, I'm fine.

1105
01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.480 align:center line:-4
Take more than a wee bump
on the heed to get rid of me.

1106
01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.960 align:center line:-3
Yeah, well, I'm pleased to hear it.

1107
01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:56.960 align:center line:-3
I hope you'll always be here.

1108
01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.960 align:center line:-3
Well, nowhere else to go.

1109
01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.960 align:center line:-3
PHONE RINGS

1110
01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:05.960 align:center line:-4
Oh, Joe.
I got nothing from the grandad.

1111
01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.000 align:center line:-3
I hope you had better luck.

1112
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.960 align:center line:-4
Aye, we caught Alice sneaking out
with a delivery,

1113
01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.960 align:center line:-3
dropping food off for Chloe.

1114
01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:14.960 align:center line:-4
She's also admitted to giving her
a tent and some warmer clothes.

1115
01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:15.960 align:center line:-3
Well, so, can we find her?

1116
01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.960 align:center line:-4
'There's a drop-off point
they use for supplies.'

1117
01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:20.960 align:center line:-4
Alice hasn't actually been
to where Chloe's camping.

1118
01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.960 align:center line:-3
Steph also managed to convince her

1119
01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.960 align:center line:-4
that she'd do more help for Chloe
by trusting us.

1120
01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.960 align:center line:-3
'Well done, Joe. Excellent.'

1121
01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.960 align:center line:-3
OK, you two check that out,

1122
01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.960 align:center line:-4
and I'll be with you
as soon as I can.

1123
01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:32.960 align:center line:-3
All right, boss.

1124
01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.960 align:center line:-3
Gotta go, Kenny.

1125
01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.960 align:center line:-4
Oh, Ma'am, the results are just in
from Cragside Cottage.

1126
01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:44.960 align:center line:-4
Er, there's a mishmash of prints
as well as Brad's. But, er...

1127
01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.160 align:center line:-3
there's no matches on our system.

1128
01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:48.960 align:center line:-4
And it's only Brad's prints
on the syringe.

1129
01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:51.960 align:center line:-4
But the initial tests
on the heroin...

1130
01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.960 align:center line:-3
indicate it was cut with fentanyl.

1131
01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.960 align:center line:-3
So someone did kill him!

1132
01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.960 align:center line:-3
And the result on Dave Limbal's car.

1133
01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:01.960 align:center line:-3
They found Josh's DNA, in the boot.

1134
01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:04.960 align:center line:-4
So it was him
who moved the body to Ghyllstead.

1135
01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:11.960 align:center line:-4
So he must've got his car to the
kids' home on Sunday night, somehow.

1136
01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:15.960 align:center line:-3
OK, Kenny. Change of plan.

1137
01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.960 align:center line:-3
Get him back in here.

1138
01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.960 align:center line:-3
Bradley Russell is dead, love.

1139
01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:29.960 align:center line:-3
Murdered.

1140
01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.160 align:center line:-4
Yeah, it's a good job
you're tucked up in here with us,

1141
01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:36.960 align:center line:-4
or you might be another loose end
to be tidied up.

1142
01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:37.960 align:center line:-3
Now, here's what I know.

1143
01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:42.160 align:center line:-3
Bradley Russell killed Josh Worsten,

1144
01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:45.960 align:center line:-3
but it was you who moved the body.

1145
01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:50.960 align:center line:-4
Forensics have confirmed he was in
the boot of your car, love. Plus...

1146
01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.800 align:center line:-4
..we've your shoe print
at the scene.

1147
01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:57.640 align:center line:-4
Now, you told us
you didn't drive to work on Sunday.

1148
01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:59.960 align:center line:-3
But that's a lie.

1149
01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:03.960 align:center line:-4
Your car was picked up on ANPR,
driving into work,

1150
01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.320 align:center line:-3
but we don't see it leaving.

1151
01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.160 align:center line:-4
Now, here's something else
we've discovered.

1152
01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:13.960 align:center line:-4
There's a dirt track
at the back of Rosefall.

1153
01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:18.160 align:center line:-4
And if you take that,
you can avoid Longwater altogether.

1154
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.960 align:center line:-3
And you...

1155
01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:25.960 align:center line:-4
..drove all the way
to Ghyllstead Plains,

1156
01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:29.960 align:center line:-4
dumped his body,
drove all the way back home

1157
01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:32.960 align:center line:-4
and then cycled
to finish your paperwork.

1158
01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.960 align:center line:-3
Now, we know all that.

1159
01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:41.000 align:center line:-4
What I don't know
is why he killed Josh. Hm?

1160
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.960 align:center line:-4
Why you moved his body,
why you defended the lad

1161
01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:46.960 align:center line:-3
and why you lied to us.

1162
01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.480 align:center line:-3
Because it was my fault!

1163
01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.480 align:center line:-3
What was?

1164
01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:54.960 align:center line:-4
He was meant to be
an Independent Visitor,

1165
01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.960 align:center line:-3
not an investigative reporter.

1166
01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.960 align:center line:-3
I heard he was working on an idea,

1167
01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:03.320 align:center line:-4
talking some nonsense about how
private care homes can't have

1168
01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.960 align:center line:-3
the kids' best interests at heart.

1169
01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:08.960 align:center line:-4
I confronted Josh.
We had a blazing row.

1170
01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.640 align:center line:-3
Didn't make any difference.

1171
01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.960 align:center line:-3
Brad saw us just after.

1172
01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:15.960 align:center line:-4
I was upset, was worked up,
told him what was going on,

1173
01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:17.160 align:center line:-3
and he said he would sort it.

1174
01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.960 align:center line:-4
What, said he was gonna
threaten him?

1175
01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:21.960 align:center line:-3
And you let him?

1176
01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:22.960 align:center line:-3
No, I told him to leave it.

1177
01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:25.960 align:center line:-4
But... Brad felt
the same way I did, that...

1178
01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:29.800 align:center line:-4
Josh was taking advantage,
that he was exploiting us.

1179
01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.480 align:center line:-4
I can't believe
he took a knife with him.

1180
01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.960 align:center line:-3
That was just madness!

1181
01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:37.320 align:center line:-3
And Chloe saw this?

1182
01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.960 align:center line:-4
Brad said he caught
a glimpse of her,

1183
01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.480 align:center line:-3
thought she'd probably saw, yeah.

1184
01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:45.960 align:center line:-4
And you thought you'd sort it
by taking his body to Ghyllstead,

1185
01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:47.960 align:center line:-3
throwing suspicion on Chloe.

1186
01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.960 align:center line:-4
Brad was scared.
I was just trying to help him!

1187
01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.960 align:center line:-3
You were covering up a murder!

1188
01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.960 align:center line:-3
Throwing suspicion on another kid!

1189
01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:59.960 align:center line:-4
But that wasn't my idea!
Oh.

1190
01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.960 align:center line:-3
So, who's was it, then, love? Mm?

1191
01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.960 align:center line:-4
Was it the same person
who killed Bradley Russell?

1192
01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.960 align:center line:-3
Look, I don't know!

1193
01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.960 align:center line:-3
I don't know, OK?

1194
01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.800 align:center line:-3
But this is on me.

1195
01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:19.960 align:center line:-3
I'm the one to blame.

1196
01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:22.640 align:center line:-3
SHE SIGHS

1197
01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:27.320 align:center line:-3
Right, we're getting somewhere.

1198
01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:30.000 align:center line:-4
He's admitted
that Bradley Russell killed Josh

1199
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.960 align:center line:-4
and that he moved the body
to Ghyllstead.

1200
01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.960 align:center line:-3
Now, it's all connected to a fight

1201
01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.960 align:center line:-4
over Josh digging into
the kids' home.

1202
01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:39.960 align:center line:-4
Digging into what, exactly?
Well, it being privately funded.

1203
01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:44.960 align:center line:-4
So I need you to find everything
you can on who the owners are.

1204
01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.960 align:center line:-4
He's hiding something,
maybe protecting someone.

1205
01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.480 align:center line:-4
And meanwhile,
that lass is still in danger,

1206
01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:51.960 align:center line:-3
so quick as you can, Kenny.

1207
01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:52.960 align:center line:-3
Yes, Ma'am.

1208
01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.960 align:center line:-4
Well, I reckon this is about
as close as we're gonna get.

1209
01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:07.960 align:center line:-4
Don't wanna scare Chloe off, anyway.
If she's even up there.

1210
01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.960 align:center line:-4
You not got the right footwear
for it, boss?

1211
01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:14.960 align:center line:-3
Kenny!

1212
01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:18.960 align:center line:-4
I've been reading
how profitable children's homes are.

1213
01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:21.960 align:center line:-4
But come and look at this.
It's unbelievable.

1214
01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.960 align:center line:-4
Private equity,
sovereign wealth funds.

1215
01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:26.960 align:center line:-3
Look at that!

1216
01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:29.960 align:center line:-3
Hm, rumoured investment in...

1217
01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.320 align:center line:-3
Tyneverse Homes?

1218
01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:33.960 align:center line:-3
I thought they owned Rosefall?

1219
01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:39.960 align:center line:-4
Well, it says here Tyneverse is part
of a bigger group, Seaworth Care.

1220
01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.320 align:center line:-3
Got their fingers in lots of pies.

1221
01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:44.960 align:center line:-4
Wow, looks like
they're making a mint,

1222
01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.960 align:center line:-4
if these accounts
are anything to go by.

1223
01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:52.960 align:center line:-4
And look who
the Group Executive Chair is.

1224
01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:53.960 align:center line:-3
Helen Allenby?

1225
01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:58.480 align:center line:-4
Aye. Now, she's the founder
of Cravenwest Academy.

1226
01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.960 align:center line:-3
'Ey, what's this over there?

1227
01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:18.960 align:center line:-3
Chloe?

1228
01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:27.960 align:center line:-4
That's still warm.
Aye, she saw us coming.

1229
01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:29.960 align:center line:-3
Come on.

1230
01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:35.640 align:center line:-3
Now, when we talked before,

1231
01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:39.960 align:center line:-4
you didn't mention your company runs
the residence Chloe was in.

1232
01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.160 align:center line:-4
Rosefall?
Mm.

1233
01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.960 align:center line:-4
Well, yes, it's under
the Seaworth Care umbrella.

1234
01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.960 align:center line:-4
But if you want information
on the kids' homes,

1235
01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.960 align:center line:-4
I can put you in touch
with Charles Stamoran.

1236
01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:51.960 align:center line:-3
He's across that side of things.

1237
01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.960 align:center line:-4
Well, I hear
there are fortunes to be made

1238
01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:56.320 align:center line:-3
from that side of things.

1239
01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.960 align:center line:-3
Rinsing local authorities...

1240
01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:02.960 align:center line:-4
Though I suspect a whiff of a murder
at one of your homes

1241
01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:05.480 align:center line:-4
might put a bit
of a dent in that. Mm?

1242
01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:09.480 align:center line:-4
I'm sorry, but what has all this got
to do with finding Chloe Spencer?

1243
01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.960 align:center line:-4
Because calls were made
from this office

1244
01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.960 align:center line:-4
to the landline at Rosefall
several times this week.

1245
01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.960 align:center line:-4
Now, have you been talking
to Dave Limbal?

1246
01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.960 align:center line:-3
Why shouldn't I have been?

1247
01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:20.960 align:center line:-3
Well, you've just told me,

1248
01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:23.960 align:center line:-4
it's your man Stamoran deals
with the kids' homes.

1249
01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:29.960 align:center line:-3
Now, someone told Dave Limbal

1250
01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:33.000 align:center line:-4
that Josh Worsten had been saying
negative things about your company.

1251
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.960 align:center line:-4
Now, was that you?
Did you tell him that? Mm?

1252
01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:41.960 align:center line:-4
And did you tell Dave Limbal
to shut Josh up,

1253
01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.160 align:center line:-3
and the poor fella ends up dead?

1254
01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.960 align:center line:-4
I think I've heard enough
of this nonsense.

1255
01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.960 align:center line:-3
Seaworth's a successful business,

1256
01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:51.000 align:center line:-4
but all we're trying to do
is make a difference.

1257
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.960 align:center line:-4
Oh, I know it's successful, love.
I've seen the last accounts.

1258
01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:01.960 align:center line:-4
And how did you know
about Josh's little project, anyway?

1259
01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:05.960 align:center line:-4
And who did you get to deal
with Bradley Russell?

1260
01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.960 align:center line:-3
I said I think we're done.

1261
01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.960 align:center line:-4
For now, pet, but don't go making
any travel plans.

1262
01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:18.960 align:center line:-3
Kenny, where's that Seaworth file?

1263
01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.960 align:center line:-4
HE GRUNTS
It's here, Ma'am.

1264
01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.960 align:center line:-3
All right.

1265
01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.960 align:center line:-4
Well, what are you looking for?
The firm who does their accounts.

1266
01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.960 align:center line:-3
Brigante Accounting, Ma'am.

1267
01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.960 align:center line:-4
What's the registered address?
Er, let's have a look.

1268
01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:37.960 align:center line:-3
Yeah, stop there.

1269
01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.960 align:center line:-3
That's Chris Worsten's address.

1270
01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:45.960 align:center line:-3
Josh's dad is Seaworth's accountant!

1271
01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.960 align:center line:-3
Kenny, it all fits.

1272
01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.960 align:center line:-4
Even down to the fentanyl.
His wife's a GP!

1273
01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:00.960 align:center line:-4
So HE told Helen Allenby
about his son's project.

1274
01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:05.320 align:center line:-4
She told Dave Limbal,
asked him to deal with it.

1275
01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.160 align:center line:-4
And she's been tidying up
ever since.

1276
01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:11.960 align:center line:-4
Come on, Kenny, I need you with me.
Ma'am.

1277
01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.960 align:center line:-3
Will do, cheers.

1278
01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.960 align:center line:-4
Uniform are at the Worstens', Ma'am.
No sign of Chris.

1279
01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.960 align:center line:-3
And what's the wife say?

1280
01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.160 align:center line:-4
Ah, that he went out
hiking yesterday.

1281
01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.960 align:center line:-4
Talked about camping over
a couple of nights.

1282
01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:27.960 align:center line:-4
Right. Well, we'll bring her in
and ask about the fentanyl

1283
01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:30.960 align:center line:-3
cos my guess is she prescribed it.

1284
01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:34.960 align:center line:-3
And he'll be camping at Ghyllstead.

1285
01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:36.960 align:center line:-3
It was him who took the lad there

1286
01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.960 align:center line:-4
in that four-by-four
Jimmy Hebble saw.

1287
01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.960 align:center line:-3
And he's still there.

1288
01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.160 align:center line:-3
Then why hang around the same area?

1289
01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.960 align:center line:-4
SHE EXHALES
Unfinished business, Kenny.

1290
01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:46.960 align:center line:-3
He's after Chloe Spencer!

1291
01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.960 align:center line:-3
CHEERING

1292
01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:42.960 align:center line:-3
MA: You should all know the rules.

1293
01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:45.960 align:center line:-4
All these costumes are gonna make
finding anyone a nightmare.

1294
01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:49.960 align:center line:-4
Now, the witch can be anywhere
within the set area.

1295
01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.960 align:center line:-3
Come and find her!

1296
01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:55.960 align:center line:-4
But if she catches you first...
you're dead!

1297
01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.960 align:center line:-4
MA CACKLES
CROWD: Ooh!

1298
01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.960 align:center line:-4
Well, that was in great taste,
weren't it?

1299
01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:03.640 align:center line:-4
CHEERING,
HORN BEEPS

1300
01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:05.960 align:center line:-3
It's the boss.

1301
01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:09.960 align:center line:-3
DRUMMERS PLAY

1302
01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:19.960 align:center line:-4
Right, now we're looking
for Chloe Spencer AND Chris Worsten.

1303
01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:22.640 align:center line:-4
What, Josh's dad?
Aye, trust me.

1304
01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:24.160 align:center line:-3
The lass is in great danger,

1305
01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.960 align:center line:-4
but she'll be more spooked
than ever,

1306
01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:28.960 align:center line:-4
especially if she sees
a police presence,

1307
01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.960 align:center line:-3
so keep uniform in the background.

1308
01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.960 align:center line:-4
Right, you and Steph,
stay in the crowd in the village

1309
01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:35.480 align:center line:-3
and keep your eyes peeled.

1310
01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.960 align:center line:-4
Mark, Kenny and I will try
and get ahead of the hunt.

1311
01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:47.160 align:center line:-3
PANTS

1312
01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:55.160 align:center line:-4
CHEERING,
BELL RINGS

1313
01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.640 align:center line:-4
They're off. They're heading
out of the village now.

1314
01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:00.800 align:center line:-3
We're following behind.

1315
01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.480 align:center line:-4
MARK: Yeah, it looks like most
of them are going into the trees.

1316
01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:10.960 align:center line:-3
Well, it's a good place to hide,

1317
01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:13.800 align:center line:-4
because they can't use
the castle this year.

1318
01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.960 align:center line:-4
SCREAM,
CHEERING

1319
01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:20.480 align:center line:-3
The witch has caught some folks.

1320
01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:22.320 align:center line:-4
Yeah. Hang on.
There, there. Who's that?

1321
01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.960 align:center line:-4
Hang on, I think that's Esther,
Chloe's friend from the Academy.

1322
01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:27.320 align:center line:-3
Now, keep an eye on her.

1323
01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.960 align:center line:-4
We've got eyes
on one of Chloe's friends.

1324
01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:32.640 align:center line:-4
'Er, there's someone with her.
They're heading into the trees.'

1325
01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.000 align:center line:-3
We're under the trees now.

1326
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.960 align:center line:-4
SCREAM
She's caught someone.

1327
01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.960 align:center line:-4
Are we sure that the other person
with Esther is Chloe?

1328
01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.960 align:center line:-3
'We couldn't see. They're masked.'

1329
01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:48.960 align:center line:-4
We've eyes on them now. Pursuing.
Hey! Stop there!

1330
01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:51.960 align:center line:-3
Masks off, now.

1331
01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.640 align:center line:-4
Off.
He said, "Masks off".

1332
01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.960 align:center line:-3
We're just trying to find Chloe.

1333
01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.960 align:center line:-3
It's not her.

1334
01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:04.960 align:center line:-4
'It's not Chloe with Esther.
It's Alice Hartford.'

1335
01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:10.960 align:center line:-3
Wait, where'd the boss go?

1336
01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:21.960 align:center line:-3
Chloe! Chloe, love.

1337
01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:24.960 align:center line:-4
Who are you?
It's all right, pet.

1338
01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:25.960 align:center line:-4
I'm not the witch.
VERA CHUCKLES

1339
01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.960 align:center line:-3
Though some people might disagree.

1340
01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:33.640 align:center line:-4
No, I'm Vera. Just... Just Vera,
and I'm with the police, love.

1341
01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:35.960 align:center line:-3
No, I'm here to help you.

1342
01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:37.960 align:center line:-3
Now, then...

1343
01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:40.960 align:center line:-3
We know...

1344
01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:42.960 align:center line:-3
..you saw what happened to Josh.

1345
01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.480 align:center line:-3
You saw Bradley Russell kill him.

1346
01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:51.960 align:center line:-4
Does he know I'm here?
Er, no. No, he doesn't, love.

1347
01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:55.960 align:center line:-4
Now, I know only too well
what it feels like to be alone,

1348
01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:59.960 align:center line:-4
have no-one to talk to,
to have to fight on your own.

1349
01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:01.960 align:center line:-3
You're a survivor.

1350
01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:05.960 align:center line:-4
But now I have
a confession to make, love.

1351
01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:08.960 align:center line:-3
And I hope you'll forgive me.

1352
01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:12.480 align:center line:-3
But I read some of your diary.

1353
01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:14.960 align:center line:-4
No, but I had to, love,
cos I needed to find you.

1354
01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:19.960 align:center line:-4
But, hey, lass,
you write so beautifully.

1355
01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:22.960 align:center line:-3
I felt like I'd already met you.

1356
01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:25.000 align:center line:-3
So, will you come with me, pet?

1357
01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:28.960 align:center line:-4
Let me and my colleagues
keep you safe.

1358
01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:29.960 align:center line:-3
Come on, that's it.

CHLOE SCREAMS
Hey! Leave her alone.

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:39.960 align:center line:-4
You're not fooling anyone
in that mask, Mr Worsten.

1361
01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.960 align:center line:-3
Take the ridiculous thing off.

1362
01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:48.960 align:center line:-4
Helen Allenby tell you
to wear that, did she?

1363
01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:50.960 align:center line:-4
CHLOE PANTS
You've no idea.

1364
01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:53.480 align:center line:-4
You don't understand.
Oh, yes, I do.

1365
01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.960 align:center line:-4
We found Josh's laptop
in your house,

1366
01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:57.960 align:center line:-3
the one you took from his digs.

1367
01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:04.000 align:center line:-4
He confided in you
about his expose project, didn't he?

1368
01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.000 align:center line:-3
No.

1369
01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:10.000 align:center line:-3
He was so excited. He...

1370
01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:12.960 align:center line:-4
He'd been in touch
with a production company,

1371
01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:13.960 align:center line:-3
and they were interested.

1372
01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:17.960 align:center line:-4
Oh, so you told your mate Helen?
She said not to worry.

1373
01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:18.960 align:center line:-3
She said...

1374
01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:20.960 align:center line:-3
..she'd handle it.

1375
01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:21.960 align:center line:-4
But the next thing...
CHLOE EXCLAIMS

1376
01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.000 align:center line:-4
Stay there!
Leave her!

1377
01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.960 align:center line:-4
And the next thing I hear
is that my son is dead.

1378
01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:35.960 align:center line:-4
Ah! So she came to you, did she,
full of sadness,

1379
01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.960 align:center line:-3
and told you who killed your son?

1380
01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:41.960 align:center line:-4
And she got you to bring
Bradley Russell out here

1381
01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:45.960 align:center line:-4
cos she thought Chloe would be
at that cottage.

1382
01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:47.960 align:center line:-3
Her happy place.

1383
01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:53.960 align:center line:-4
And the heroin?
Was that Helen's idea, too?

1384
01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:58.960 align:center line:-4
Aye, and you leapt at the chance
of lacing it with fentanyl

1385
01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.960 align:center line:-3
cos you knew it would kill him.

1386
01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:03.960 align:center line:-4
Made your own wife
an accomplice to murder.

1387
01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:04.960 align:center line:-3
He killed that boy!

1388
01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:08.960 align:center line:-4
Aye, HE did, not Chloe!
She's done nothing.

1389
01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:13.160 align:center line:-3
Except be fond of Josh.

1390
01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:16.640 align:center line:-4
So, what're you gonna do, love?
CHLOE WHIMPERS

1391
01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:18.960 align:center line:-3
Are you gonna kill her? Well...

1392
01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.960 align:center line:-4
You're gonna have
to kill me, too, pet.

What'll happen to me now?

1398
01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.960 align:center line:-4
Well, I've got someone from

1399
01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:11.640 align:center line:-3
I'm going back to Rosefall?

1400
01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.960 align:center line:-4
Well, I have had a conversation
with your grandparents,

1401
01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:16.960 align:center line:-4
and maybe something
can be sorted out there.

1402
01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:20.960 align:center line:-4
If that's what you want.
I think I'd like that. But...

1403
01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.960 align:center line:-4
I'm not really sure what I want
any more, after everything.

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:35.000 align:center line:-4
Life's just one scary decision
after another.

1405
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.960 align:center line:-4
But the fight
I've seen in you, love?

1406
01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.960 align:center line:-3
You're gonna be fine.

1407
01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:41.960 align:center line:-4
Now, the witch here's
gonna take care of you

1408
01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:43.960 align:center line:-3
until social services turn up.

1409
01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:48.960 align:center line:-3
All right.

1410
01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:53.960 align:center line:-4
Joe, look. Get a round in
for the team for me, will you?

1411
01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.960 align:center line:-4
That'll not even pay
for Kenny's drinks.

1412
01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:00.480 align:center line:-4
Look, I'll owe you.
Erm, I'll not be long.

1413
01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.320 align:center line:-4
I've just got
one last visit to make.

1414
01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:06.960 align:center line:-3
CAR BEEPS

1415
01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:14.960 align:center line:-4
I heard there was
a school board meeting.

1416
01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:15.960 align:center line:-3
Run late, did it?

1417
01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:17.960 align:center line:-3
It did.

1418
01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:21.960 align:center line:-4
So, if you don't mind,
I'd just like to get home.

1419
01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:22.960 align:center line:-3
Oh, no, of course.

1420
01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:26.960 align:center line:-4
No, I just wanted to let you know
that I've now got the full picture.

1421
01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.960 align:center line:-3
And what full picture's that?

1422
01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:35.800 align:center line:-4
Well, my tech team managed to get
into Josh's computer.

1423
01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:41.960 align:center line:-4
Well, my goodness,
he'd done his research.

1424
01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:44.960 align:center line:-4
Looked into
your company's financials,

1425
01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:47.960 align:center line:-4
followed the rumours
about your big investment.

1426
01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:50.160 align:center line:-4
He'd even set up a meeting
with a production company

1427
01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:51.800 align:center line:-3
to pitch his idea.

1428
01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:55.960 align:center line:-4
I'm afraid I don't recognise
any of what you're talking about.

1429
01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:59.000 align:center line:-4
Oh, that's OK, love.
I can, er, enlighten you.

1430
01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:04.960 align:center line:-4
Now, you heard about Josh's project
from your accountant, didn't you?

1431
01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:07.960 align:center line:-3
Mm? Josh's dad, Chris Worsten.

1432
01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:12.960 align:center line:-4
And you suddenly saw millions
in investment about to vanish.

1433
01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:17.160 align:center line:-4
So you leaned on Dave Limbal
at Rosefall to shut Josh up.

1434
01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:19.960 align:center line:-4
I think we've been through
all this already.

1435
01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:22.960 align:center line:-4
Now, listen, love. I don't believe
you asked Dave Limbal

1436
01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:24.960 align:center line:-3
to get Josh killed, I don't.

1437
01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.960 align:center line:-4
Cos that would've just drawn more
attention to yourself, wouldn't it?

1438
01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:30.960 align:center line:-3
No, you just wanted to silence him.

1439
01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:33.960 align:center line:-4
This is nonsense.
Now...

1440
01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.960 align:center line:-4
..you maintain that you come from
the same background as these kids...

1441
01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:41.960 align:center line:-3
..to empathise.

1442
01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:45.640 align:center line:-4
You don't give a stuff
about them, love.

1443
01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:47.960 align:center line:-4
You just use them,
make them suffer more.

1444
01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:51.960 align:center line:-4
I take it you've got no proof
for this fantasy?

1445
01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:56.960 align:center line:-4
Ah, now, unlike you, love,
I am good at my job.

1446
01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:59.960 align:center line:-4
All right, you've been careful,
I'll give you that.

1447
01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:02.960 align:center line:-4
Dave Limbal's not mentioned
your name, not once.

1448
01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:06.800 align:center line:-3
But Chris Worsten is helping us.

1449
01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.960 align:center line:-3
Seems he does have a conscience.

1450
01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:14.160 align:center line:-4
And those money men... always know
where the bodies are buried.

1451
01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:17.960 align:center line:-3
Drive safely, pet.

1452
01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:22.960 align:center line:-4
LAUGHTER,
LIVELY CHATTER

1453
01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.000 align:center line:-3
Boss?

1454
01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:55.960 align:center line:-4
You not coming in?
Oh, you don't need me in there.

1455
01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:59.960 align:center line:-4
Go on back inside. Enjoy yourself.
You deserve it.

1456
01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:03.960 align:center line:-3
Come on. Just for a bit.

1457
01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:05.960 align:center line:-4
I'm not staying long.
I've gotta get back to the family.

1458
01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:08.960 align:center line:-4
And they're OK, are they,
the family?

1459
01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:10.960 align:center line:-4
Aye, I've started speaking
to someone, you know.

1460
01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:11.960 align:center line:-3
Ah, well, that's good.

1461
01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.960 align:center line:-4
No, I heard your request
had been granted.

1462
01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:18.960 align:center line:-3
Look at that. In't that beautiful?

1463
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.960 align:center line:-3
Do you know what?

1464
01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:30.960 align:center line:-3
This case has really made me think.

1465
01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:33.960 align:center line:-4
And I did see a lot of myself
in young Chloe.

1466
01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.960 align:center line:-3
Made me think of a lot of things.

1467
01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:43.160 align:center line:-4
Like how good my team is.
SHE CHUCKLES

1468
01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:47.960 align:center line:-4
And it brought back
vivid memories of my dad...

1469
01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.960 align:center line:-3
..some I'd rather forget.

1470
01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:57.960 align:center line:-4
You helped me scatter Hector's
ashes, do you remember? Aye.

1471
01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.960 align:center line:-3
Don't think I ever said thank you.

1472
01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:01.960 align:center line:-3
Nah, you didn't.

1473
01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:04.960 align:center line:-3
Well, thanks.

1474
01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:08.960 align:center line:-3
You're a good man, Joe.

1475
01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:12.960 align:center line:-4
And thanks for always
having my back.

1476
01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:17.960 align:center line:-4
You coming down with something?
SHE LAUGHS

1477
01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.800 align:center line:-3
Actually, I've never felt better.

1478
01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:21.960 align:center line:-4
Now go on, get back inside,
finish your pint

1479
01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:23.000 align:center line:-3
before Kenny downs it.

1480
01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:27.960 align:center line:-4
I'll see you tomorrow, then.
SHE SCOFFS

1481
01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:51.960 align:center line:-4
KNOCKING
KHALON: Come in.

1482
01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:55.160 align:center line:-3
Oh, DCI Stanhope.

1483
01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:58.960 align:center line:-4
Er, apologies for the late hour,
Ma'am, but, erm...

1484
01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:03.960 align:center line:-4
Oh. Could this finally be your
formal acceptance of the promotion?

1485
01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:05.000 align:center line:-3
Well, it's, er...

1486
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.960 align:center line:-4
It's more about making way, Ma'am,
for others to fly.

1487
01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:30.960 align:center line:-3
RATTLING

1488
01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:37.960 align:center line:-3
CHUCKLES SOFTLY

1489
01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:51.960 align:center line:-3
BANGING

1490
01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:01.960 align:center line:-4
HECTOR: Go on, then, pet.
Give us a hand with this.

1491
01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:07.960 align:center line:-3
That's it. Line it up on that side.

1492
01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:12.320 align:center line:-4
HAMMERING
You're quiet.

1493
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.160 align:center line:-3
Summat on your mind?

1494
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.960 align:center line:-4
Need to do my schoolwork.
Ah, we'll be done wi' this soon.

1495
01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:22.960 align:center line:-4
What do you want with all that
book learning at your age, anyway?

1496
01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:26.960 align:center line:-4
The minimum requirements.
Requirements?

1497
01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:28.960 align:center line:-3
For what?

1498
01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:31.960 align:center line:-3
To join the police.

1499
01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:38.000 align:center line:-4
You can't join the police.
You won't change my mind, Dad.

1500
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.960 align:center line:-3
The police is no place for a lass.

1501
01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:41.960 align:center line:-4
You're wrong.
Am I?

1502
01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:44.960 align:center line:-3
You best prove it then, pet.

1503
01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:48.000 align:center line:-3
Morning.

1504
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.960 align:center line:-4
Morning.
Morning.

1505
01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:56.960 align:center line:-4
Kenny, the boss not in yet?
Er, haven't seen her yet.

1506
01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:00.320 align:center line:-4
Maybe's she having
a well-deserved day off for once.

1507
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.160 align:center line:-3
TSKS

1508
01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:50.000 align:center line:-3
CHUCKLES

1509
01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:53.960 align:center line:-3
Come on.

1510
01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.480 align:center line:-3
