PHONE RINGS

5
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.960 align:center line:-6
Mark, get Joe to turn his phone on.
Tell him I'm on my way.

6
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.960 align:center line:-3
Ah, DCI Stanhope.

7
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.960 align:center line:1
Oh, Chief Superintendent Kahlon.
Morning, ma'am.

8
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.960 align:center line:1
I'm, er, just on my way
to a crime scene.

9
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.960 align:center line:-4
I just need a moment.
You've an officer there?

10
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.960 align:center line:-3
DI Ashworth.

11
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.960 align:center line:-4
Competent detective?
He's the best.

12
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.960 align:center line:-4
Won't miss you for five minutes,
then. Shall we?

13
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.960 align:center line:-4
That's Lucas Corbridge.
Steelworker.

14
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.960 align:center line:-4
Chair of the union.
Convicted for killing his wife.

15
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.960 align:center line:-4
So, why's the conviction
been quashed?

16
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.960 align:center line:-4
The pathologist
was Dr William Speers.

17
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.960 align:center line:-4
Did you ever cross paths?
Briefly.

18
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.000 align:center line:-3
He was a clever man and knew it.

19
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.800 align:center line:-4
Well, a previous conviction
was quashed

20
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.480 align:center line:-3
due to questions over Speers' work.

21
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.800 align:center line:-4
That was leapt on
to appeal this conviction.

22
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.960 align:center line:-4
And his forensics
were dismissed again?

23
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.960 align:center line:-4
Speers insisted that nobody
but Corbridge had been in the house.

24
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.960 align:center line:-3
But on re-examination,

25
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.960 align:center line:-4
crime scene images showed
a cuff mark in pooled blood.

26
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.960 align:center line:-3
Not made by Lucas' clothes.

27
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.960 align:center line:-4
So, suddenly, there's reasonable
doubt someone else was there.

28
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.960 align:center line:-4
So, why wasn't this cuff mark
disclosed at the time?

29
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.960 align:center line:-3
It wasn't noticed.

30
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.960 align:center line:-4
But it means the Marion Corbridge
case is officially open again.

31
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.960 align:center line:-4
You don't want me
to look at a 20-year-old case?

32
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.960 align:center line:-4
As a matter of priority.
It's high-profile.

33
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.960 align:center line:-3
Press interest already baked in.

34
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.960 align:center line:-4
Hence needing an officer
of your calibre.

35
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.640 align:center line:-4
Oh, which reminds me, I wanted to...
give you this in person.

36
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.960 align:center line:-4
I want to recommend you
for the role of superintendent.

37
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.960 align:center line:-6
Morning, ma'am.
Mark. So, what've we got?

38
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.960 align:center line:-6
Anglers found the body
first thing this morning.

39
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.960 align:center line:-6
Kenny's with them now.
Paula's with the deceased.

40
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.960 align:center line:-6
We've secured the cordon and
kicked off an initial search. Good.

41
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.960 align:center line:-6
Where's Joe?
Still in his car, ma'am.

42
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.000 align:center line:-5
He's what?

43
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.960 align:center line:-5
Well, take your time, Joe.

44
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.960 align:center line:-5
Late night, was it?

45
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.960 align:center line:-5
Vera. Lovely spot.

46
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.960 align:center line:-6
Though the water makes the recovery
of forensic evidence more difficult.

47
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.800 align:center line:-4
Oh, getting our excuses in early,
are we?

48
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.960 align:center line:-4
So, we've a male.
Late 20s or early 30s.

49
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.000 align:center line:-4
Physically fit with
an obvious wound to the head here.

50
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.960 align:center line:-4
So, dead before he went
into the water?

51
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.960 align:center line:-4
I'll confirm drowning
or otherwise back at the lab.

52
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.960 align:center line:-4
But by the looks of that,
he could well have been.

53
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.960 align:center line:-4
He's got some scratches
and abrasions as well.

54
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.960 align:center line:-4
What, defence wounds?
Or just from being in the water.

55
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.000 align:center line:-4
We're searching the area
for signs of a struggle.

56
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.960 align:center line:-3
Evidence of an assailant.

57
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.800 align:center line:-4
He's got a black eye an' all.
Mm. But fading.

58
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.160 align:center line:-4
The yellow colouration suggests
it's more than 18 hours antemortem.

59
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.960 align:center line:-4
Could be a few days.
So, time of death?

60
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.960 align:center line:-4
Again, being in cold water
doesn't help.

61
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.960 align:center line:-4
But the appearance
and lack of decomposition

62
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.960 align:center line:-3
suggests much less than 24 hours.

63
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.160 align:center line:-4
Likely less than 12.
Have you found any ID?

64
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.960 align:center line:-4
We found a wallet on him.
Got the name Zachary Martin.

65
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.960 align:center line:-4
I believe you've got someone
checking for matches?

66
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.960 align:center line:-3
Oh, so not a mugging?

67
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.960 align:center line:-4
No, he had his mobile phone
on him too,

68
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.480 align:center line:-3
though waterlogged, obviously.

69
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.960 align:center line:-4
Mm. OK, you find anything else,
you let us know as soon as.

70
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.960 align:center line:-4
Ma'am. Steph's messaged
from the station.

71
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.960 align:center line:-4
Thinks she's found
the right Zachary Martin.

72
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.000 align:center line:-3
He was a prisoner.

73
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.960 align:center line:-4
He's only been out on parole
for about a month.

74
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.960 align:center line:-4
So, what was he inside for?
Er, GBH without intent.

75
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.960 align:center line:-4
Well, I need to know
who he assaulted,

76
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.800 align:center line:-4
how long he was inside,
and the exact date he was freed.

77
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.320 align:center line:-4
Ma'am. We're gonna need to let
the Probation Service know.

78
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.800 align:center line:-4
Do we know the next of kin?
Er, he was married. With a kid.

79
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah. You got an address?
Yes, ma'am.

80
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.960 align:center line:-3
Right. Joe, with me.

81
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.960 align:center line:-4
The deceased got
the maximum five-year sentence.

82
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.960 align:center line:-4
Served nearly four.
Mm.

83
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.960 align:center line:-4
Must've been a nasty incident.
It was a fight in a nightclub.

84
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.960 align:center line:-4
It seems he hit the fella,
didn't start it,

85
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.480 align:center line:-4
but he threw one punch,
and Dylan Rowlands, the victim,

86
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.960 align:center line:-4
suffered a neck fracture
and was partially paralysed.

87
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.960 align:center line:-4
So, could be a few people upset
about Zachary Martin's release.

88
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.960 align:center line:-4
I don't think his wife
was too thrilled either. Eh?

89
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.960 align:center line:-3
Well, he didn't move back in here.

90
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.960 align:center line:-3
His registered address was a hostel.

91
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.960 align:center line:-3
Is that your lad?

92
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.960 align:center line:-4
Er, Ollie. Yeah.
Now, is he here?

93
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.800 align:center line:-3
No. What's this all about?

94
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.960 align:center line:-4
Well, I'm sorry
to have to tell you this, love...

95
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.960 align:center line:-3
..but we've found a body.

96
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.960 align:center line:-4
And we believe it to be that
of your husband, Zachary Martin.

97
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.960 align:center line:-3
No.

98
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.960 align:center line:-3
What do you mean?

99
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.480 align:center line:-4
Had you seen him recently?
No. Erm, I'd...

100
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.960 align:center line:-4
We weren't together.
I'd told him to stay away.

101
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.960 align:center line:-3
Why was that?

102
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.640 align:center line:-3
I-I-I was divorcing him.

103
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.960 align:center line:-3
You know, it was just...

104
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.640 align:center line:-4
It was just cleaner
till things were sorted.

105
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.960 align:center line:-4
Well, things can't have been easy
for you the last few years, pet,

106
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.960 align:center line:-4
with a young lad,
and your husband inside, but...

107
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.960 align:center line:-4
I mean, we should never have
got married, but I got pregnant,

108
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.960 align:center line:-4
and Zac insisted on
standing by us.

109
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.960 align:center line:-4
Always jumping in with both feet.
You weren't happy?

110
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.960 align:center line:-4
I mean, Zac was good with Ollie.
Sometimes.

111
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.160 align:center line:-3
Then he would get bored.

112
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.960 align:center line:-4
You know, want a laugh.
Go out and get drunk.

113
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.960 align:center line:-4
This incident
that Zac was convicted for...

114
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.960 align:center line:-4
Were you there?
No.

115
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.960 align:center line:-3
He said he would come home early.

116
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.480 align:center line:-4
Said he wouldn't drink either.
But he did.

117
00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.960 align:center line:-3
And Dylan ends up in a wheelchair.

118
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.960 align:center line:-4
Dylan Rowlins.
The lad that Zac injured.

119
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.960 align:center line:-4
You knew the fella?
Yeah.

120
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.960 align:center line:-3
Him and Zac were best mates.

121
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.480 align:center line:-3
You know, Dylan was good for Zac.

122
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.960 align:center line:-4
I mean, I haven't seen him
since the trial, like.

123
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.960 align:center line:-4
Dylan's fiancee, Gwen,
split up with him an' all.

124
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.960 align:center line:-4
I think he lives
with his parents now.

125
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.960 align:center line:-4
And do youse know
why it all kicked off that night?

126
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.960 align:center line:-3
No.

127
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.960 align:center line:-3
Dylan saw Zac and Gwen kiss.

128
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.960 align:center line:-4
So, your husband kissed
his best mate's fiancee?

129
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.960 align:center line:-4
Now, is there any other family
we should contact?

130
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.960 align:center line:-4
No. Er, his dad raised him,
but he died last year.

131
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.480 align:center line:-4
Zac going to prison
didn't exactly help his heart.

132
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.960 align:center line:-3
I mean, what am I gonna tell Ollie?

133
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.960 align:center line:-3
DCI Stanhope?

134
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.960 align:center line:-4
Oh, sorry.
Justine Kohli, Probation Service.

135
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.960 align:center line:-3
Zac Martin's case manager.

136
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.960 align:center line:-4
So, er,
can you show us to Zac's room?

137
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.960 align:center line:-4
We had an appointment
only yesterday.

138
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.320 align:center line:-4
And did anything seem
out of the ordinary?

139
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.960 align:center line:-3
No. Nothing.

140
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.960 align:center line:-4
Zac was doing really well.
He was avoiding drink.

141
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.960 align:center line:-4
Got a job delivering takeaways.
Just wanted to rebuild his life.

142
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.960 align:center line:-4
Considering apprenticeships?
Thinking through options.

143
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.960 align:center line:-4
What he wanted most was
a relationship with his son, Ollie.

144
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.960 align:center line:-4
His missus was divorcing him.
Was he not upset about that?

145
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.960 align:center line:-4
My impression was
he'd accepted the divorce.

146
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.960 align:center line:-4
What upset him was having
to negotiate contact with his boy.

147
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:54.960 align:center line:-4
Well, we need to keep
this room sealed for now, pet.

148
00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.960 align:center line:-4
Did you notice
a black eye yesterday?

149
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.960 align:center line:-3
Oh, yeah.

150
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.960 align:center line:-4
He'd been carrying his delivery bike
down some steps and tripped.

151
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.960 align:center line:-3
Smacked into a lamp post.

152
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.480 align:center line:-4
Is his bike here?
Er, don't know. I'll ask the warden.

153
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.800 align:center line:-4
You can't think of anyone
who wanted to harm him?

154
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.960 align:center line:-4
Nothing connected with Dylan
Rowlins, the fella he assaulted?

155
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.960 align:center line:-3
I didn't hear of any trouble.

156
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.960 align:center line:-4
The family weren't too happy
with his release,

157
00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.960 align:center line:-3
but that's understandable.

158
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.960 align:center line:-4
Right, now, I'll need a copy of all
his probation reports, love. Thanks.

159
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.800 align:center line:-3
OK, listen up.

160
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.960 align:center line:-4
Now, the reason this place
is looking more like a storage depot

161
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.960 align:center line:-4
is because there's a cold case
we've been asked to investigate.

162
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.960 align:center line:-4
That'll be a challenge.
Aye. It's a lot to take on.

163
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.960 align:center line:-4
Well, that's not
the attitude we need, Joe.

164
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.640 align:center line:-4
Now, our first priority
is Zachary Martin.

165
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.960 align:center line:-4
We've already spoken to his wife,
Kimberley Martin.

166
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.960 align:center line:-4
And to the probation office. Mark,
how are you doing on his phone?

167
00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.960 align:center line:-4
Er, I've got his number now,
I'm onto the service provider.

168
00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.960 align:center line:-4
And, Steph, we'll need to take
a look at his bank details. Ma'am.

169
00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.960 align:center line:-4
Kenny, we should speak to
his employer about his delivery job.

170
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.960 align:center line:-4
Will do.
And now, Kenny,

171
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.960 align:center line:-4
if he was working yesterday,
I wanna know every stop he made.

172
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.960 align:center line:-4
Cos maybe someone was unhappy
with their pepperoni.

173
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.960 align:center line:-4
And, Mark, let's hit CCTV.
Now, time of death's uncertain.

174
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.480 align:center line:-4
So, we need a timeline
of his last known movements. Ma'am.

175
00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.960 align:center line:-4
And, Steph, let's get onto
the prison where he served his time.

176
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.960 align:center line:-4
Er, yeah, already done, ma'am.
They're happy to meet.

177
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.960 align:center line:-4
And in the meantime, they've sent
a list of his significant contacts.

178
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.960 align:center line:-3
Ah, well done.

179
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.960 align:center line:-3
Glad someone's on the ball, eh, Joe?

180
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.800 align:center line:-3
His bike is missing.

181
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.960 align:center line:-4
It might make it easier for us
to find him if he was cycling.

182
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.960 align:center line:-3
All right. Let's get to it.

183
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.960 align:center line:-3
Hold up. "Lucas Corbridge"?

184
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.960 align:center line:-4
Who? It's the subject
of our cold case, Kenny.

185
00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.960 align:center line:-4
He was banged up for killing
his wife. What about him?

186
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.960 align:center line:-3
Well, he's on this list.

187
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.960 align:center line:-4
He was on the same prison wing
as our deceased.

188
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:09.960 align:center line:-4
So, this fella had his conviction
quashed only yesterday, walks free.

189
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.960 align:center line:-4
And the same day,
Zachary Martin dies?

190
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.960 align:center line:-4
Well, that's a bit of a coincidence.
They do happen, you know.

191
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.960 align:center line:-3
Ah, well, coincidence or not,

192
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.800 align:center line:-4
I think I need a little chat
with Mr Corbridge.

193
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.960 align:center line:-3
HE YAWNS

194
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.960 align:center line:-4
There you go.
Ah, thanks, love.

195
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.960 align:center line:-4
You been up late
reading about this Lucas?

196
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.960 align:center line:-3
What, and you haven't?

197
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.960 align:center line:-4
I thought a bit of background
on the fella would be useful

198
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.960 align:center line:-4
before I speak the prison
about him and Zac.

199
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.960 align:center line:-3
Now, this fella, Lucas Corbridge,

200
00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.960 align:center line:-4
was chair of
the multi-union committee.

201
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.960 align:center line:-4
Fighting to save thousands of jobs.
Bit of a local hero.

202
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.960 align:center line:-4
Now, he claimed he arrived home
to find his missus already dead,

203
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.960 align:center line:-4
having fallen from the landing
down into the hall. Broken neck.

204
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.960 align:center line:-4
Are we sure it wasn't an accident?
Now, she'd been drinking.

205
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.000 align:center line:-4
But I can't see her tripping
and coming over those bannisters.

206
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.960 align:center line:-4
And the pathologist
was sure it was murder.

207
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.960 align:center line:-4
Aye, William Speers?
Aye, now deemed unreliable.

208
00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.160 align:center line:-4
Well, he says he was alone
when he found her.

209
00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.960 align:center line:-4
And had her blood
and cerebrospinal fluid on him.

210
00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.960 align:center line:-4
Witness statements painted him
as having a temper.

211
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.960 align:center line:-4
And there was a call out
from neighbours about a domestic.

212
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.960 align:center line:-4
Do we know what they fought about?
Aye. It's in the report.

213
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.960 align:center line:-4
It came out his missus
had been having an affair.

214
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.480 align:center line:-4
Married 18 years.
15-year-old daughter.

215
00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.960 align:center line:-3
And then she cheats on him.

216
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.960 align:center line:-4
Worse, it was with someone
in management at the steelworks.

217
00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.960 align:center line:-3
You're kidding.

218
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.960 align:center line:-4
Now, what if he found out
she was cheating?

219
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:04.960 align:center line:-4
They argue. He snaps.
Maybe he was guilty after all.

220
00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.960 align:center line:-3
Well, maybe he is.

221
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.960 align:center line:-4
Either that or we're looking
for a completely new killer.

222
00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.960 align:center line:-3
Aye, potentially.

223
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.960 align:center line:-4
Plus, finding out
if there's any connection

224
00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.960 align:center line:-3
between him and Zachary Martin.

225
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.960 align:center line:-4
Right, I'm off
to see Lucas Corbridge.

226
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.960 align:center line:-3
You get yourself over to the prison.

227
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.960 align:center line:-4
I was out
at a union campaign meeting.

228
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.960 align:center line:-3
Finished about five.

229
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.960 align:center line:-3
I went home... and I found her.

230
00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.960 align:center line:-3
Marion. The door was on the latch.

231
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.960 align:center line:-3
But she left it that way sometimes.

232
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.320 align:center line:-3
Our Amelia was out at a youth club.

233
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.320 align:center line:-4
I thought it was an accident
till you lot cried murder.

234
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.960 align:center line:-3
She drank too much, you know.

235
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.000 align:center line:-4
Liked other men's attention too.
All right, Dee.

236
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.960 align:center line:-3
Things were rocky between us.

237
00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.960 align:center line:-4
I wasn't that present.
I know that now.

238
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:02.960 align:center line:-3
But I loved her.

239
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.480 align:center line:-3
I'd never hurt her.

240
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.160 align:center line:-4
When did you find out
about the affair?

241
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.960 align:center line:-4
I'd suspected something was off
for a while.

242
00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.960 align:center line:-4
I didn't know for sure.
There was a lot going on.

243
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.640 align:center line:-3
But you want the truth.

244
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.960 align:center line:-3
Genuinely the truth.

245
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.960 align:center line:-4
You take a closer look
at that bastard Theo Patterdale,

246
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.960 align:center line:-3
if he's still breathing.

247
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.960 align:center line:-4
It were probably his lot and
your lot that cooked up charging me.

248
00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.960 align:center line:-4
What, the steelworks
and the police?

249
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.960 align:center line:-4
The establishment. Closing ranks.
HE COUGHS

250
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.960 align:center line:-3
You OK, pet?

251
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.960 align:center line:-3
I've COPD.

252
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.960 align:center line:-3
Manageable, but bloody annoying.

253
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.800 align:center line:-4
Now, I'll also need to speak
to your daughter. Amelia, is it?

254
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.960 align:center line:-3
We've not been in touch for years.

255
00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.960 align:center line:-4
She turned her back.
Dee.

256
00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.960 align:center line:-4
When he was arrested,
she came to stay with me.

257
00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.320 align:center line:-4
But once he was convicted, jailed,
she deserted him.

258
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.960 align:center line:-3
Never visited. Not once.

259
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.960 align:center line:-3
Then she... Then she left.

260
00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.960 align:center line:-3
Because she thought I was guilty.

261
00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.960 align:center line:-4
Do you have an address?
No.

262
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.800 align:center line:-3
OK. Er, just one last thing.

263
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.960 align:center line:-3
Not to do with your wife's death.

264
00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.960 align:center line:-3
Zachary Martin.

265
00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.960 align:center line:-3
Zac? Aye, what about him?

266
00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.960 align:center line:-4
Mm, yeah. You knew him in prison?
I liked Zac. Aye.

267
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.960 align:center line:-4
Kid were in pieces
when he first came in.

268
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.960 align:center line:-3
He'd mucked up badly and he knew it.

269
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.960 align:center line:-3
He was released about a month back.

270
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.960 align:center line:-3
Mm. And I'm sorry to tell you, love,

271
00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.160 align:center line:-3
he was found dead yesterday.

272
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.960 align:center line:-3
How? What happened?

273
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.960 align:center line:-4
Well, we're treating his death
as suspicious.

274
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.960 align:center line:-4
Now, did you see him
when you were freed?

275
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.960 align:center line:-4
On Wednesday?
Maybe celebrate getting out?

276
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.960 align:center line:-4
What? No.
What are you implying?

277
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.960 align:center line:-4
I drove Lucas straight home
from the appeal.

278
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.960 align:center line:-4
We were together
the rest of the day.

279
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.960 align:center line:-4
Now, I really think you've stayed
long enough. Don't you?

280
00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.320 align:center line:-3
OK. Thanks for your time, pet.

281
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.960 align:center line:-3
It's OK. I can see myself out.

282
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.960 align:center line:-3
Greg. Thanks for meeting.

283
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.960 align:center line:-4
Welcome to the other end
of the food chain.

284
00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.960 align:center line:-3
So, you worked with Zachary Martin?

285
00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.960 align:center line:-4
I'm Senior Custodial Manager
for the wing that he was on.

286
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.960 align:center line:-4
I can't believe he got parole,
only to...

287
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.960 align:center line:-3
He was a model prisoner by the end.

288
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.960 align:center line:-4
Took responsibility for his crime.
Did courses.

289
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.960 align:center line:-4
Was he ever violent?
Nah. He liked the gym.

290
00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.960 align:center line:-4
Maybe that's where he took out
most of his aggression.

291
00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.960 align:center line:-4
Can you tell us about his
relationship with Lucas Corbridge?

292
00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.960 align:center line:-4
They got on.
Lucas had a soft spot for him.

293
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.960 align:center line:-4
And was that unusual?
For Lucas, yeah.

294
00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.960 align:center line:-3
See, Lucas...

295
00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.960 align:center line:-3
..always maintained his innocence.

296
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.960 align:center line:-3
But he had a connection to Zac?

297
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.800 align:center line:-4
Zac was a mess
when he first arrived.

298
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.960 align:center line:-3
Full of guilt. Scared to be inside.

299
00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.960 align:center line:-4
Lucas kept him out of trouble.
Pretty fierce about that.

300
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.960 align:center line:-3
Fierce?

301
00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.960 align:center line:-4
We think that a prison gang
started hassling Zac.

302
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.160 align:center line:-4
Lucas swung for the guy
that was on his back.

303
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.960 align:center line:-4
And they left him alone after that?
Seemed to.

304
00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.960 align:center line:-4
How did Zac feel about leaving?
He was upbeat, I think.

305
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:56.000 align:center line:-4
Just... just a little nervous
about him mucking up again.

306
00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.320 align:center line:-3
HE SIGHS

307
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.960 align:center line:-3
Hey.

308
00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.960 align:center line:-3
Listen, I'm just calling to say...

309
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.960 align:center line:-4
that I'm sorry
about what I said last night.

310
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.960 align:center line:-3
No, that's not what I mean.

311
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.960 align:center line:-4
Celine, I'm just not ready
to see someone.

312
00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.160 align:center line:-3
Let me do it in my own time.

313
00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.640 align:center line:-3
OK, let me get this straight.

314
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.160 align:center line:-4
So you're saying,
when they were inside,

315
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.960 align:center line:-4
there was a strong connection
between Zac Martin and Corbridge.

316
00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.960 align:center line:-3
As friends.

317
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:56.960 align:center line:-3
I still see it as a coincidence,

318
00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.160 align:center line:-4
him dying the day
that Corbridge was released.

319
00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.000 align:center line:-3
Yeah, well, after we've seen Paula,

320
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.960 align:center line:-4
let's check out this fella
Zac assaulted, Dylan Rowlins.

321
00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:06.960 align:center line:-3
See what he has to say.

322
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.960 align:center line:-3
No water in his lungs.

323
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.960 align:center line:-4
So he definitely didn't drown?
It was the blow to the head.

324
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.960 align:center line:-4
Caused a severe
subdural haemorrhage,

325
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.960 align:center line:-4
and he was put
in the water postmortem.

326
00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.960 align:center line:-4
Hard to be more specific about when,
I'm afraid.

327
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.480 align:center line:-4
Ah, that's helpful.
You're welcome.

328
00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.000 align:center line:-4
What can you tell us
about this head injury?

329
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.320 align:center line:-3
Er, the angle suggests he was struck

330
00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.960 align:center line:-4
from behind or the side
with great force.

331
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.960 align:center line:-3
No visible defence wounds.

332
00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.960 align:center line:-4
No alcohol or drugs
in his system either.

333
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.960 align:center line:-4
So, he could've been walking away?
Mm.

334
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.640 align:center line:-3
What was he hit with?

335
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.640 align:center line:-4
I recovered some fragments
on what appear to be sandstone.

336
00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.960 align:center line:-3
Which might prove useful

337
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.960 align:center line:-4
because examination of the riverside
picked up no evidence

338
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.960 align:center line:-3
that he was killed there.

339
00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.960 align:center line:-3
Meaning we've got no murder site.

340
00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.960 align:center line:-4
Well, you're the gift
that keeps on giving today, love.

341
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.960 align:center line:-4
How about this, then?
We've the stone fragment.

342
00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.960 align:center line:-4
Plus some pollen
found inside his T-shirt,

343
00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.960 align:center line:-3
picked up as he was dragged.

344
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.960 align:center line:-4
So, there's a chance of ID-ing
potential sites further upstream?

345
00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.960 align:center line:-3
Correct.

346
00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.960 align:center line:-4
And what's more, I have a contact at
the university checking the pollen.

347
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.960 align:center line:-4
I'll pass on the details.
Yeah, well, make sure you do.

348
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.640 align:center line:-3
Ah. There's also...

349
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.960 align:center line:-3
..gravel embedded in his knees.

350
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.960 align:center line:-4
So, that's consistent with being hit
and collapsing forward.

351
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.960 align:center line:-4
Could be from a walking track?
A car park?

352
00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:20.960 align:center line:-3
What about his black eye?

353
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.160 align:center line:-4
Aye, his parole officer said
he smacked into a lamp post.

354
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.320 align:center line:-4
It can be hard to distinguish
accidental trauma injuries

355
00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.960 align:center line:-3
from non-accidental...

356
00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.960 align:center line:-4
But for my money,
it looks more like he's been hit.

357
00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.960 align:center line:-4
OK. Make sure you send us
that contact.

358
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.960 align:center line:-4
Joe, this is really important.
Zac Martin.

359
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.960 align:center line:-4
Now, I want you to liaise
with Paula's contact at the uni.

360
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.960 align:center line:-3
And on the cold case,

361
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.960 align:center line:-4
I've got Kenny putting out feelers
for Corbridge's daughter.

362
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.960 align:center line:-4
And tracking down
this Theo Patterdale,

363
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.960 align:center line:-4
the fella he reckons
his Mrs was carrying on with.

364
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.960 align:center line:-4
Did you hear me?
Yeah, of course.

365
00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.960 align:center line:-3
And, er...

366
00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.960 align:center line:-3
Well, I didn't say, but, er...

367
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.800 align:center line:-4
I had some other news yesterday
from Chief Superintendent Kahlon.

368
00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.960 align:center line:-4
Oh, aye?
Mm.

369
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.160 align:center line:-3
She's recommended me for promotion.

370
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.960 align:center line:-4
You what?
Yeah.

371
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.800 align:center line:-3
Well, that's... that's amazing.

372
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.480 align:center line:-4
Oh, hold on.
I didn't say I was going for it.

373
00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.960 align:center line:-3
Well, why wouldn't you?

374
00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.960 align:center line:-4
Well, it's all paperwork
and politics, isn't it?

375
00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.960 align:center line:-4
Who wants that?
Ah, get away.

376
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.960 align:center line:-4
You would've turned it down
straight off if you didn't want it.

377
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.960 align:center line:-4
You could change things
with your experience.

378
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.960 align:center line:-4
Well, it must be nice
to be asked, anyway.

379
00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.320 align:center line:-3
SHE CHUCKLES

380
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.800 align:center line:-4
Zachary Martin's been murdered.
What?

381
00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.960 align:center line:-3
Good riddance is all I can say.

382
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.640 align:center line:-3
And we're investigating his death.

383
00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:01.960 align:center line:-4
Now, you and he were best mates,
is that right, love?

384
00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.960 align:center line:-3
Yeah, once.

385
00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.960 align:center line:-3
Zac was fun. Always a bit crazy.

386
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.960 align:center line:-4
Crazy? In what way?
Impulsive. You know?

387
00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.960 align:center line:-4
Always looked on the bright side,
no matter what fix he was in.

388
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.960 align:center line:-3
Now, the night you were injured...

389
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.960 align:center line:-4
..there was an argument at the club
over Gwen, your fiancee?

390
00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.960 align:center line:-4
I saw her with Zac, and...
I went for him.

391
00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.800 align:center line:-4
It's hard to remember.
We'd all been drinking.

392
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.960 align:center line:-4
And with what happened after, I...
Dylan, he pleaded guilty.

393
00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.960 align:center line:-4
It just shows. Should've still
been locked up for it.

394
00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.960 align:center line:-4
Erika... There's no shame
in saying how we feel.

395
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.960 align:center line:-4
That lad put my son in a wheelchair.
You'd feel the same.

396
00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.960 align:center line:-3
I'm glad he got his comeuppance.

397
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.960 align:center line:-4
Did any of you see Zac
once he was out?

398
00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.960 align:center line:-3
No. Of course not.

399
00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.320 align:center line:-4
We'll just have to check
your movements on Wednesday, OK?

400
00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:57.960 align:center line:-4
What? What for?
Oh, it's just routine, love.

401
00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.960 align:center line:-3
Er, ma'am? You need to see this.

402
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:09.960 align:center line:-4
I've been trawling the CCTV
for Zac Martin's final movements.

403
00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.960 align:center line:-3
This was Wednesday, 8:22am.

404
00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.960 align:center line:-4
You know what?
That's his missus and their lad.

405
00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, and a second camera...
shows him.

406
00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.960 align:center line:-4
Doesn't wanna be seen, does he?
Was he spying on them?

407
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.960 align:center line:-4
Does he approach?
Er, not that we see from here.

408
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.960 align:center line:-4
Ma'am? I've looked
into his bank account.

409
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.960 align:center line:-4
While he was inside,
he agreed to a third-party mandate,

410
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.000 align:center line:-4
allowing Kimberley to operate
the account on his behalf.

411
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000 align:center line:-4
Oh, makes sense.
Yeah. And there's more.

412
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.960 align:center line:-4
See this? This is over
most of the last two years.

413
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.960 align:center line:-3
Right.

414
00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.960 align:center line:-3
She's emptied it.

415
00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.960 align:center line:-4
Well, he wouldn't have been
too chuffed about that, would he?

416
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.160 align:center line:-4
Good morning, pet.
Have you got a minute?

417
00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.960 align:center line:-4
We know it was you
who took the money out.

418
00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.000 align:center line:-4
£8,000, give or take.
Did Zac ask you to withdraw it?

419
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.320 align:center line:-4
He gave us access.
I've done nothing wrong.

420
00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.960 align:center line:-4
I doubt he gave you access
to drain the account, pet.

421
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:22.960 align:center line:-4
Is that why you told him
to stay away?

422
00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.960 align:center line:-3
Because you'd taken it all?

423
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.960 align:center line:-4
Look, we've got
a kid together, right?

424
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.960 align:center line:-4
Zac went inside, and suddenly, I was
a single mam, no other support.

425
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.960 align:center line:-4
I mean, do you know
how expensive stuff is?

426
00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.640 align:center line:-4
Food. Kids' clothes.
Handbags?

427
00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.960 align:center line:-4
Did he know the extent
you were spending?

428
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.960 align:center line:-4
I was gonna tell him.
But you didn't, did you?

429
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.960 align:center line:-4
So he discovered it
when he came out.

430
00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.320 align:center line:-3
How did he react?

431
00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.960 align:center line:-4
He was angry. At first.
We had a fight.

432
00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.960 align:center line:-4
OK? But he knew he owed me
and Ollie.

433
00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.960 align:center line:-3
All right, how about this?

434
00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.960 align:center line:-4
This is you and Ollie
together in town.

435
00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.960 align:center line:-3
And this is Zac watching you.

436
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.960 align:center line:-3
The day that he died.

437
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.960 align:center line:-3
Well, I... I didn't see him.

438
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.960 align:center line:-3
I didn't know.

439
00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.960 align:center line:-4
Ah, well, you told us you and your
lad were home all Wednesday evening.

440
00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.960 align:center line:-3
Can anyone corroborate that?

441
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.320 align:center line:-3
Now, listen, love, I get it.

442
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.960 align:center line:-4
Maybe Zac just wanted
his money back,

443
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.000 align:center line:-4
and there was a confrontation,
and things got out of hand.

444
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.960 align:center line:-3
No. I didn't see him.

445
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.960 align:center line:-4
So it's up to you
to prove otherwise.

446
00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.480 align:center line:-3
Didn't know about this.

447
00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.960 align:center line:-4
Well, Zac didn't mention Kimberley
cleaning out his bank account.

448
00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.960 align:center line:-4
Was he not angry
all his money had gone?

449
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.960 align:center line:-4
He mentioned they had an argument
soon after his release.

450
00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.960 align:center line:-4
But he'd agreed to keep
his distance after that.

451
00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.960 align:center line:-3
So why did he spy on her?

452
00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.960 align:center line:-4
Well, maybe he's trying to see
Ollie there, not Kimberley.

453
00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:09.320 align:center line:-4
Dylan Rowlins and his family were
angry about Zac's early release.

454
00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.960 align:center line:-3
They posted about it online.

455
00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.960 align:center line:-4
Sounds pretty common
for a victim and their family.

456
00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.960 align:center line:-3
So Zac didn't receive any threats?

457
00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.960 align:center line:-3
Threats? No, not that he said.

458
00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.800 align:center line:-4
Did he ever mention a fellow inmate
called Lucas Corbridge?

459
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.960 align:center line:-4
Sure. Yeah, Zac liked him.
Said he'd looked out for him.

460
00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.960 align:center line:-4
Cos you realise he was released
the day that Zac died?

461
00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.960 align:center line:-3
And you think he was involved?

462
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.960 align:center line:-3
Well, I've no reason to.

463
00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.960 align:center line:-4
Did Zac ever talk about
wanting to meet him on the outside?

464
00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.320 align:center line:-4
Not to me. There was someone
he was trying to find.

465
00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.960 align:center line:-3
A, erm... A family member, I think.

466
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:42.960 align:center line:-3
Did he give you a name?

467
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.800 align:center line:-4
Er, Isobel? Imelda?
It was just a quick comment.

468
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.320 align:center line:-4
He'd left her a message,
but she didn't reply.

469
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.960 align:center line:-3
OK. We'll look into it.

470
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.960 align:center line:-4
Ma'am. A few updates
on the Lucas Corbridge case.

471
00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:01.960 align:center line:-4
So, Marion's lover,
this Theo Patterdale,

472
00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.960 align:center line:-3
seems he relocated to Australia.

473
00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.480 align:center line:-3
I'm chasing.

474
00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.960 align:center line:-4
What about the estranged daughter,
Amelia?

475
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.960 align:center line:-3
Well, that's more of an odd one.

476
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.960 align:center line:-4
Well, we know
she left her Aunt Deena's

477
00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.960 align:center line:-3
when her dad got banged up.

478
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.960 align:center line:-4
Aye, she was 16.
Er, she squatted for a bit,

479
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.960 align:center line:-4
had a few minor contacts
with the police, no serious record.

480
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.320 align:center line:-4
Erm, but after that,
she just drops off the map.

481
00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.960 align:center line:-3
No further police involvement.

482
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.960 align:center line:-4
And I don't have a current address
for her.

483
00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.960 align:center line:-4
I did notice in the file
that her social worker...

484
00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.960 align:center line:-3
..was Kath Olivier.

485
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.960 align:center line:-4
Not seen her in years.
I'll pay her a visit. Thanks.

486
00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.960 align:center line:-3
Ma'am.

487
00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.480 align:center line:-3
Oh, and Kenny...

488
00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.960 align:center line:-4
I'm off now to meet
your former boss, DCI Creelan,

489
00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.960 align:center line:-3
to talk about this cold case.

490
00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.160 align:center line:-3
Get his take on it.

491
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.960 align:center line:-3
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

492
00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.960 align:center line:-3
DCI Stanhope.

493
00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.960 align:center line:-3
I've had no reply to that letter.

494
00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.640 align:center line:-3
Ah, yes, ma'am. No, not yet, ma'am.

495
00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.960 align:center line:-4
I just haven't had much time.
Of course.

496
00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:12.960 align:center line:-4
Actually, ma'am... there may be
a link between the Corbridge case

497
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.960 align:center line:-3
and Zac Martin's murder.

498
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.320 align:center line:-3
A link?

499
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.000 align:center line:-4
Well, they were in prison together,
ma'am, pretty close, in fact.

500
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.960 align:center line:-4
And Corbridge was released
the day Zac Martin died.

501
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.960 align:center line:-3
Surely a coincidence?

502
00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:27.160 align:center line:-4
Well, I have to explore
every angle, ma'am.

503
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.960 align:center line:-3
Just keep me in the loop.

504
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.960 align:center line:-4
And I'll await
a response on the other matter.

505
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.960 align:center line:-3
Quick as you like.

506
00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.960 align:center line:-3
Hello?

507
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.960 align:center line:-3
Gary Creelan?

508
00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.960 align:center line:-3
Chasing salmon, are you?

509
00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.960 align:center line:1
Finest place in the whole
of England and Wales for it.

510
00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.960 align:center line:1
Oh, aye.
My dad used to say the same.

511
00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:31.960 align:center line:-4
The joys of retirement, eh? Ha.
So...

512
00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.960 align:center line:-3
..Lucas Corbridge.

513
00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.960 align:center line:-3
Oh, aye.

514
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.960 align:center line:-4
Now, you'd have heard about
the introduction of reasonable doubt

515
00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.960 align:center line:-3
at the hearing.

516
00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.960 align:center line:-3
Now, what are your thoughts on that?

517
00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.960 align:center line:-4
I stand by our investigation...
and the team that worked it.

518
00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.960 align:center line:-3
Men like Kenny Lockhart.

519
00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.640 align:center line:-3
But not the pathologist.

520
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.960 align:center line:-3
Aye, that's it... isn't it?

521
00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:00.640 align:center line:-3
A perfectly good case blown up

522
00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.960 align:center line:-4
because Will Speers
missed something.

523
00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.640 align:center line:-3
Did you ever query his findings?

524
00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.960 align:center line:-3
Will? No. He was experienced.

525
00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:10.960 align:center line:-3
Highly regarded.

526
00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.960 align:center line:-3
And frankly,

527
00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:17.960 align:center line:-4
so what if a tiny forensic element
was a little bit flaky?

528
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.960 align:center line:-4
"So what?"
SHE CHUCKLES

529
00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.960 align:center line:-3
Look, the conviction was sound.

530
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.960 align:center line:-4
Corbridge killed her.
It's the only thing that adds up.

531
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.960 align:center line:-3
You've gotta remember the pressure

532
00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.000 align:center line:-4
that he must have been under
at the time.

533
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.960 align:center line:-4
He's a rabble-rouser
to the right-wing press.

534
00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.960 align:center line:-4
And to his own side,
he was never doing enough.

535
00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:40.960 align:center line:-4
Then to find out that his wife
was, well, sleeping with the enemy?

536
00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.000 align:center line:-3
Well, he lost it. Lashed out.

537
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.960 align:center line:-3
Yeah, well, what about this fella

538
00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.960 align:center line:-4
she was having the affair with,
Theo Patterdale?

539
00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.960 align:center line:-4
Cast-iron alibi.
He never went near their house.

540
00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:58.480 align:center line:-4
And you must've been under a lot
of pressure to get a result? Hm?

541
00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.960 align:center line:-4
Aye. Get all that from Corbridge,
did you?

542
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:04.960 align:center line:-4
All that nonsense about the
establishment having it in for him?

543
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.800 align:center line:-3
So no truth in it?

544
00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.960 align:center line:-3
Listen... my dad was a steelworker.

545
00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.960 align:center line:-4
I didn't want that site shut
any more than Corbridge did.

546
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.960 align:center line:-4
But I wasn't gonna let him
get away with murder.

547
00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:22.960 align:center line:-4
Now, his daughter broke off
all contact with him

548
00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.960 align:center line:-3
after his conviction.

549
00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.960 align:center line:-3
Have you any idea where she went?

550
00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.960 align:center line:-3
Nah.

551
00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.960 align:center line:-4
But you know
how it is with these cases,

552
00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.960 align:center line:-3
once you've got the result...

553
00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.960 align:center line:-3
Oh, I like to keep an ear out.

554
00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.960 align:center line:-4
After all... it's not just
about the result, is it?

555
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.960 align:center line:-3
SHE CHUCKLES

556
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.960 align:center line:-4
Er, it's all just bluster.
Defending himself.

557
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.960 align:center line:-4
JOE: 'So, you're coming
back to the station, then?'

558
00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.960 align:center line:-4
What? No.
By the time I've driven back...

559
00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.960 align:center line:-4
'Now, Mark's had to cover
your work today, Joe. Get a grip.'

560
00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.000 align:center line:-3
Yes, boss.

561
00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.960 align:center line:-3
HE SIGHS

562
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.960 align:center line:-4
Sir, I've looked into that name
from the parole manager.

563
00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.000 align:center line:-4
Yeah. Isobel, Imelda or whatever.
Maybe a family member.

564
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.960 align:center line:-4
Well, Zac Martin had
no living family to speak of.

565
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.960 align:center line:-4
And I've found no-one in his phone
with a similar name

566
00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.960 align:center line:-4
or on his list
of his prison visitors.

567
00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:37.960 align:center line:-4
Though checking that did throw up
one surprise, a Gwen Cobden.

568
00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.960 align:center line:-3
Gwen?

569
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.960 align:center line:-3
Hang on, that's Dylan Rowlins's ex.

570
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.960 align:center line:-4
But what's she doing visiting
the man who was sent down

571
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:46.960 align:center line:-3
for attacking her fella?

572
00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.960 align:center line:-3
They shared that kiss.

573
00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.960 align:center line:-4
Maybe there was still something
between them? Aye, maybe.

574
00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:57.960 align:center line:-4
Steph, remind me...
where was Mark at again today?

575
00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.960 align:center line:-4
Er, I think the boss asked him
to meet Paula's contact at the uni.

576
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.960 align:center line:-4
Course, OK.
Go on, get yourself away.

577
00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.960 align:center line:-3
Night, then.

578
00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:18.960 align:center line:-3
HE SIGHS

579
00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.960 align:center line:-3
Well, well, well. Vera Stanhope.

580
00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.960 align:center line:-3
Kath Olivier.

581
00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.960 align:center line:-3
SHE CHUCKLES

582
00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.960 align:center line:-3
Oh, look at this.

583
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.960 align:center line:-3
KATH LAUGHS

584
00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.320 align:center line:-3
How are you? How's Scott?

585
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.960 align:center line:-4
Shane.
Shane.

586
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.960 align:center line:-3
He died.

587
00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:13.640 align:center line:-3
Only joking. But we did divorce.

588
00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.960 align:center line:-3
Seven years back now.

589
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.960 align:center line:-4
I've been crying
every night since (!)

590
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.160 align:center line:-4
Well, I doubt that.
THEY CHUCKLE

591
00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.640 align:center line:-4
I heard you're practically running
things here now. Hardly.

592
00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.960 align:center line:-3
Why aren't you Chief Constable yet?

593
00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.160 align:center line:-3
Oh, who wants that job?

594
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.960 align:center line:-4
So, Amelia Corbridge.
Ah.

595
00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:36.640 align:center line:-4
Now, you worked on her case
when her dad was arrested,

596
00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.960 align:center line:-3
did an assessment, that right?

597
00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:39.960 align:center line:-3
I did. I've pulled the file.

598
00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.960 align:center line:-4
And what was your take on her?
On the family?

599
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.960 align:center line:-4
Well, she was traumatised.
Understandably.

600
00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.960 align:center line:-3
15 then. Lost her mum.

601
00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.960 align:center line:-4
Then sat through a trial
that convicted her father.

602
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.960 align:center line:-3
Mm. Was she and her father close?

603
00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.000 align:center line:-4
Yeah. She looked up to him.
Loved him.

604
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.960 align:center line:-3
And did she believe he was guilty?

605
00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:06.000 align:center line:-3
Honestly? No, I don't think so.

606
00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.960 align:center line:-3
So why did the lass run off?

607
00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.000 align:center line:-3
Her aunt says she deserted him.

608
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.960 align:center line:-3
KATH SIGHS

609
00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:20.960 align:center line:-4
Well... the shock of
actually seeing him convicted?

610
00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.160 align:center line:-3
I mean, it must have been massive.

611
00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.960 align:center line:-4
And I got the impression that the
aunt cared more for him than her.

612
00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.320 align:center line:-3
OK, thanks for this, Kath.

613
00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.960 align:center line:-4
Well, sure.
Come back with any more questions.

614
00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.960 align:center line:-3
Otherwise, see you in ten years.

615
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:39.800 align:center line:-4
Ah, well, I might leave it for 15
if I'm gonna get this kind of grief.

616
00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.960 align:center line:-4
SHE CHUCKLES
Be lucky.

617
00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:54.960 align:center line:-4
Thanks for coming to meet me, Gwen.
OK, I....

618
00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.960 align:center line:-3
I know it's weird, me visiting Zac.

619
00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.960 align:center line:-4
I know what he did
seems unforgivable.

620
00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.160 align:center line:-3
But it's not as if I'm blameless.

621
00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.960 align:center line:-4
Because of the kiss that happened
that night?

622
00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.160 align:center line:-4
It just happened.
Everyone was cutting loose.

623
00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.640 align:center line:-4
Me and Zac had always fancied
each other a bit.

624
00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.960 align:center line:-3
Found ourselves off in a corner.

625
00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.480 align:center line:-3
Dylan ran over... shouting.

626
00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.960 align:center line:-3
And you saw the fight between them?

627
00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:22.960 align:center line:-4
Hardly a fight.
Dylan had a swing, missed.

628
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.160 align:center line:-4
That riled up Zac,
and he punched back.

629
00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.960 align:center line:-4
Then, erm, last year,
Zac asked to send me a letter.

630
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.960 align:center line:-4
Part of him taking responsibility.
So... So I visited him.

631
00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.960 align:center line:-3
He even wanted to contact Dylan.

632
00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.960 align:center line:-3
Really? Dylan didn't say anything.

633
00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.160 align:center line:-4
You've talked to him?
Mm-hm. And his parents.

634
00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.960 align:center line:-4
Ah, I can just imagine
what he said about me, too.

635
00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.960 align:center line:-4
Who? His dad?
Aye. Rich.

636
00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.960 align:center line:-4
I stayed with Dylan
through his recovery.

637
00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.960 align:center line:-3
But Rich, he... he hated me.

638
00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:57.960 align:center line:-4
He wanted me gone.
And when I did leave, he blamed me.

639
00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:00.960 align:center line:-4
Said that I'd abandoned Dylan
cos he was disabled.

640
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:05.160 align:center line:-4
Rich controls everyone
in that family.

641
00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.960 align:center line:-4
I wanna do some digging
on Rich Rowlins.

642
00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.000 align:center line:-4
I'll get Steph to run
a background check.

643
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.640 align:center line:-4
There's more to him
than meets the eye.

644
00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.960 align:center line:-3
Right.

645
00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.960 align:center line:-3
Anything from the uni?

646
00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.960 align:center line:-3
Paula's contact?

647
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.800 align:center line:-4
I thought that
Mark was dealing with that.

648
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.960 align:center line:-3
He was, because you weren't.

649
00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.960 align:center line:-3
I'm sorry.

650
00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.320 align:center line:-4
It's just juggling two cases,
I let it slip.

651
00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:35.320 align:center line:-4
You did. But you've been letting
things slip quite a bit lately, Joe.

652
00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.960 align:center line:-4
Well, since you've been back
from compassionate leave.

653
00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.480 align:center line:-4
Now, if you need
some more time off...

654
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.960 align:center line:-3
No. Why? No.

655
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.960 align:center line:-3
Ma'am? Zac Martin's murder site.

656
00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.960 align:center line:-4
I've got Mark on the phone.
He thinks they found it.

657
00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.640 align:center line:-3
We found some blood samples.

658
00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.960 align:center line:-4
Need to confirm
it's from Zachary Martin.

659
00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.960 align:center line:-3
Now, well, as quick as you can.

660
00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.960 align:center line:-4
Well done, Mark.
Thanks, ma'am.

661
00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.960 align:center line:-4
But it was, er, Paula's friend
from the uni.

662
00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.480 align:center line:-3
Well, and a bit of luck.

663
00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.960 align:center line:-4
We managed to trace the pollen
to this area.

664
00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.960 align:center line:-3
It's from a pretty rare species.

665
00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.000 align:center line:-4
Er, plus looking
for somewhere with gravel,

666
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000 align:center line:-4
probably near a river,
helped narrow down the search area.

667
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.960 align:center line:-3
Finding Zac's bike sealed it.

668
00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.960 align:center line:-3
So, he was killed in the car park

669
00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.960 align:center line:-4
and then dragged
that way to the river.

670
00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.960 align:center line:-4
The question is:
why cycle all the way out here

671
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.960 align:center line:-3
in the first place, hm?

672
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:42.960 align:center line:-3
Ma'am?

673
00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:49.640 align:center line:-4
He was dragged this way.
Could be his attacker's phone.

674
00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:52.640 align:center line:-4
Yeah, well, let's hope it's not
some random dog walker's. Cheers.

675
00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.960 align:center line:-3
Looks like it is Zac's phone.

676
00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, well,
we already found his phone.

677
00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.960 align:center line:-4
Why's he need two?
Look who's with him.

678
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.000 align:center line:-3
His parole officer.

679
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.960 align:center line:-3
Looking very cosy.

680
00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.960 align:center line:-3
Well, well, well...

681
00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.960 align:center line:-3
We found this handset yesterday.

682
00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.960 align:center line:-4
Belonged to the deceased
Zachary Martin.

683
00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.960 align:center line:-3
It was a secret phone.

684
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:30.960 align:center line:-4
And there are some very intimate
photos of you on there.

685
00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.800 align:center line:-4
You were having a relationship
with your client.

686
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:34.960 align:center line:-3
That's gross misconduct.

687
00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.960 align:center line:-4
End of your career.
Possible jail time.

688
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.480 align:center line:-4
I knew the phone'd turn up,
that you'd find out.

689
00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.480 align:center line:-3
I'm glad you did.

690
00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.960 align:center line:-4
There's no-one else grieving him,
is there? At least I can now.

691
00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:53.640 align:center line:-4
Now, you told us you didn't see him
after your meeting on Wednesday.

692
00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:58.480 align:center line:-4
But, erm...
you called him on this number

693
00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.960 align:center line:-3
at 8:07 that evening.

694
00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:04.160 align:center line:-3
And again at 8:32. Now, why's that?

695
00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.960 align:center line:-4
He was supposed to come round mine,
but he didn't show.

696
00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.800 align:center line:-4
So I called him,
and he didn't answer.

697
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.960 align:center line:-3
So you were home all evening? Hm?

698
00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.960 align:center line:-3
You can't be serious.

699
00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.480 align:center line:-4
Zac was gonna reveal the affair.
You had to keep him quiet.

700
00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:17.800 align:center line:-3
No, I loved him.

701
00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:18.960 align:center line:-3
Well, whether you did or not, love,

702
00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:22.960 align:center line:-4
you've obstructed our investigation
and concealed the truth!

703
00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.960 align:center line:-4
He was worried about me,
what might happen!

704
00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.000 align:center line:-4
That... That's why I got him
the phone -

705
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.960 align:center line:-3
so we could talk in private.

706
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.960 align:center line:-4
And there's summat you should know.
What?

707
00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.960 align:center line:-3
I gave him money.

708
00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.160 align:center line:-3
How much?

709
00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:41.960 align:center line:-3
A thousand pound. In cash.

710
00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.000 align:center line:-3
For what?

711
00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.960 align:center line:-3
It was for a deposit on a flat.

712
00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.960 align:center line:-3
He was just...

713
00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.960 align:center line:-4
He was just so desperate
to get out of that hostel.

714
00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:58.960 align:center line:-4
Mark,
check Justine Kohli's bank account.

715
00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.960 align:center line:-4
She's just told us she gave Zac
a thousand pounds in cash.

716
00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.960 align:center line:-4
Er, well, there was no cash found
in his room. Mm.

717
00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.960 align:center line:-4
And we've got no evidence that
he did put a deposit down on a flat.

718
00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.960 align:center line:-4
So if he got the cash,
where did it go?

719
00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.320 align:center line:-3
Aye. Where did it go?

720
00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:15.960 align:center line:-4
Steph, I want every call, every
number on that new phone looked at.

721
00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:16.960 align:center line:-3
Already on it, ma'am.

722
00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.960 align:center line:-4
So, we've got lines of enquiry
for Zac Martin

723
00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:23.960 align:center line:-4
on his missus, the Rowlins family,
and now his parole officer.

724
00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:26.960 align:center line:-4
And that means we can take
Lucas Corbridge out of the equation.

725
00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.000 align:center line:-4
The two cases aren't connected.
No, not yet.

726
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.960 align:center line:-4
There's still the connection
between him and Zac.

727
00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.960 align:center line:-3
Keep on it, Joe.

728
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.960 align:center line:-4
Ma'am? Theo Patterdale.
Back in the UK.

729
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:37.960 align:center line:-3
Took a bit of persuading,

730
00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:40.480 align:center line:-4
but you've got a meeting
later on this morning.

731
00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.960 align:center line:-3
Thanks, Kenny.

732
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:46.960 align:center line:-3
Vera?

733
00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.960 align:center line:-4
If you're after the results
on the blood from the car park,

734
00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.960 align:center line:-4
good news,
it's a match with Zac Martin's.

735
00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.960 align:center line:-4
Ta. Well, I'd have been surprised
if it wasn't.

736
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.960 align:center line:-4
No, but I'm actually here
about something else.

737
00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:01.320 align:center line:-4
Now, you'll know about the fella
had his convictions overturned.

738
00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:05.960 align:center line:-4
Lucas Corbridge? Banged up for
killing his missus 20 years back.

739
00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:09.960 align:center line:-4
Er, yes. Weren't the forensics
re-examined and disputed? Aye.

740
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:13.160 align:center line:-4
Now, I need an expert eye
going over those findings.

741
00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.960 align:center line:-4
Expert? And I've taken a look
at the case file,

742
00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.960 align:center line:-4
and it's easy to see how
a narrative was pushed to the jury

743
00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.960 align:center line:-3
who convicted him.

744
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:26.960 align:center line:-4
Now, Paula, I just want to know
which forensics we can trust.

745
00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.960 align:center line:-4
Can we definitively say
she was murdered?

746
00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:32.960 align:center line:-4
And what evidence
actually points to the husband?

747
00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.000 align:center line:-4
Some random case?
I'm snowed under here.

748
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.640 align:center line:-4
No, trust me, it's not random.
The case has been reopened.

749
00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:41.960 align:center line:-4
Ah, come on, Paula,
what's your going rate?

750
00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.960 align:center line:-4
Er...
Can of cola?

751
00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:45.960 align:center line:-3
Six pack?

752
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:49.960 align:center line:-3
Go on, get out.

753
00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.960 align:center line:-3
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

754
00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:56.960 align:center line:-3
DCI Stanhope.

755
00:45:58.960 --> 00:45:59.960 align:center line:-3
Who?

756
00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:03.960 align:center line:-3
Hello.

757
00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.960 align:center line:-3
You want to meet?

758
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.960 align:center line:-4
OK, I'll just liaise with Joe,
and we can... Why not?

759
00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.000 align:center line:-4
I'll call you back, love.
Everything OK?

760
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.960 align:center line:-3
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

761
00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.640 align:center line:-4
Boss, Khalon's in your office
waiting for you.

762
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.960 align:center line:-3
Ma'am?

763
00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:37.000 align:center line:-4
Deena Corbridge has made
a complaint to the IOPC.

764
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.960 align:center line:-4
She alleges
her brother's being harassed by you

765
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:42.960 align:center line:-4
when he's only just been released
and is in poor health.

766
00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.960 align:center line:-4
Harassed?
There was no harassment, ma'am.

767
00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.160 align:center line:-3
Why's she saying that?

768
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.960 align:center line:-4
She mentioned you asking
about Zac Martin's death.

769
00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.960 align:center line:-4
It can only feed
Lucas Corbridge's narrative

770
00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.160 align:center line:-3
that the police are out to get him.

771
00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.640 align:center line:-4
I warned you
we'd have to be sensitive.

772
00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:00.960 align:center line:-4
My job involves asking
awkward questions, ma'am.

773
00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.640 align:center line:-3
And if they go to the press?

774
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:06.000 align:center line:-4
See, these are just the sorts
of sensitivities you'll juggle

775
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.960 align:center line:-3
once you're superintendent.

776
00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:09.960 align:center line:-3
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am,

777
00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.960 align:center line:-4
I can't conduct an investigation
based on what the press thinks,

778
00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.960 align:center line:-4
or Deena Corbridge.
KNOCK ON DOOR

779
00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.640 align:center line:-3
Er, sorry to interrupt, ma'am.

780
00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.000 align:center line:-4
You asked me to remind you,
your meeting with Theo Patterdale.

781
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.960 align:center line:-4
Thanks, Kenny.
I have the address.

782
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.960 align:center line:-3
Don't let me keep you, DCI Stanhope.

783
00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.480 align:center line:-3
Ma'am.

784
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.960 align:center line:-3
WHISPERS: Thank you.

785
00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:41.960 align:center line:-4
It's a lovely spot.
I used to come here with my mam.

786
00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:46.960 align:center line:-3
How did this liaison start?

787
00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.960 align:center line:-4
We met at a union event.
Marion was fun.

788
00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:51.640 align:center line:-3
Full of life.

789
00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:53.960 align:center line:-3
But below that, unhappy.

790
00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.160 align:center line:-3
In what way unhappy?

791
00:47:58.960 --> 00:47:59.960 align:center line:-3
In her marriage.

792
00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.960 align:center line:-4
She said Lucas cared more
about the steelworks than her.

793
00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.960 align:center line:-4
He'd certainly
no sense of reality about it,

794
00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:06.960 align:center line:-3
fighting the inevitable.

795
00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.320 align:center line:-4
It was Marion who pursued me,
by the way.

796
00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.960 align:center line:-3
Oh. So you weren't keen at first?

797
00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.960 align:center line:-4
Well, I knew who she was married to.
HE SIGHS

798
00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:19.800 align:center line:-4
Even worried it might have been
some kind of... setup.

799
00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.960 align:center line:-4
What? He was using her to get
the low down on management?

800
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.320 align:center line:-3
Seems paranoia went both ways.

801
00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:28.960 align:center line:-4
So, you got the sense
that he knew about the affair?

802
00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:32.160 align:center line:-4
Well, I could believe that
Marion got drunk and let it slip.

803
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.960 align:center line:-4
And Lucas, he had a temper,
didn't he? Marion said so.

804
00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:36.320 align:center line:-3
Him and his sister.

805
00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.320 align:center line:-3
His sister? How do you mean?

806
00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:39.640 align:center line:-3
HE SIGHS

807
00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:43.960 align:center line:-4
Said she was too invested in their
family, that it was unhealthy. Hm.

808
00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.480 align:center line:-4
Now, you told the police
that you were working late

809
00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.960 align:center line:-4
the day Marion died.
That's right.

810
00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.960 align:center line:-4
A management meeting debating
our response to the union.

811
00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.960 align:center line:-4
And why exactly are you
back here now?

812
00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.480 align:center line:-3
My mother died last year.

813
00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.960 align:center line:-4
There's the house to deal with,
her things.

814
00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.960 align:center line:-3
Hey, I'm sorry, love.

815
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:08.960 align:center line:-4
And you've had no contact
with Corbridge?

816
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:11.960 align:center line:-3
No.

817
00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:14.000 align:center line:-4
Well, thanks for talking to us,
love.

818
00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:20.000 align:center line:-4
And you will let us know before
travelling back to Australia, hm?

819
00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:29.960 align:center line:-3
We're getting nowhere fast here.

820
00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:32.960 align:center line:-3
Now, in terms of our cold case,

821
00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.960 align:center line:-4
we're stuck with what DCI Creelan
always claimed.

822
00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:40.960 align:center line:-4
Cos it looks like
Patterdale's alibi is sound.

823
00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.960 align:center line:-4
So we're left with our only suspect,
and that's Corbridge.

824
00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.160 align:center line:-3
Yeah, Kenny's spoken to two

825
00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.960 align:center line:-4
of Patterdale's colleagues
from the time.

826
00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:49.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, they both remember him being
at that steelworks meeting.

827
00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:53.640 align:center line:-4
Ma'am, I've something on Zac Martin.
CCTV.

828
00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.960 align:center line:-4
This is Tuesday,
the day before he died.

829
00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:04.960 align:center line:-4
What's in that envelope?
My bet, it's money.

830
00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.960 align:center line:-4
The cash his friendly parole officer
gave him.

831
00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:08.960 align:center line:-3
Did we check her account?

832
00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:11.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah. She definitely withdrew
a thousand pounds.

833
00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:15.960 align:center line:-3
Could this be the prison gang thing?

834
00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.960 align:center line:-3
Hang on, wait. Zoom in.

835
00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:25.960 align:center line:-4
That's the prison custodial manager,
Greg Wakely.

836
00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.960 align:center line:-3
Why don't you take blues and twos,

837
00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.960 align:center line:-4
go pay this prison officer
a little home visit?

838
00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.480 align:center line:-3
DOORBELL RINGS

839
00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.960 align:center line:-3
Greg. Good to see you again.

840
00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.960 align:center line:-3
I thought you'd never ask (!)

841
00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.960 align:center line:-3
What's Zac Martin giving you here?

842
00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:05.960 align:center line:-4
No? Fine.
You just sit there and relax.

843
00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:27.960 align:center line:-3
Mark!

844
00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:47.960 align:center line:-3
Jessie Ashworth.

845
00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.960 align:center line:-3
Ah, DCI Stanhope.

846
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.960 align:center line:-3
Well, thank you so much for coming.

847
00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.960 align:center line:-3
"DCI Stanhope," is it?

848
00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.640 align:center line:-4
The last time I saw you,
you called me "Mussolini".

849
00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.960 align:center line:-3
Look at you, all grown up.

850
00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:04.960 align:center line:-3
You look just like your mam.

851
00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:09.960 align:center line:-3
So, what is it you're studying here?

852
00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.960 align:center line:-4
Oh, I'm in my final year
of my degree. Mm.

853
00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.960 align:center line:-3
Environmental science.

854
00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:18.960 align:center line:-4
And why exactly are we meeting
behind your dad's back?

855
00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:25.960 align:center line:-4
SOFTLY: Sorry.
Jessie, love, what is it?

856
00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:32.960 align:center line:-3
Erm... Dad's been sort of...

857
00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:36.960 align:center line:-3
shut off... since Granddad died.

858
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.960 align:center line:-3
Aye, I know, love.

859
00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:42.480 align:center line:-4
He's not been all there
at work either.

860
00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.320 align:center line:-3
He stays out late.

861
00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:47.960 align:center line:-4
He don't talk to Mam,
except for when they argue.

862
00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.960 align:center line:-4
And last night was
their worst fight yet.

863
00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.960 align:center line:-3
What were they fighting about?

864
00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:58.800 align:center line:-4
Er, Mam thinks
he should see someone for help.

865
00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.960 align:center line:-3
A professional.

866
00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:04.800 align:center line:-4
And I'm guessing
he wasn't keen on that idea.

867
00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:09.320 align:center line:-4
She just... feels
like she's lost him.

868
00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:13.960 align:center line:-4
Like Dad's gone, and she's just
dealing with everything alone.

869
00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:16.960 align:center line:-4
We've tried to help him.
But we just can't.

870
00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:21.960 align:center line:-3
And now we don't know what to do.

871
00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:25.960 align:center line:-3
All right, love. I'll have a word.

872
00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.960 align:center line:-4
At first, I thought you were
under pressure from a gang member.

873
00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:34.960 align:center line:-4
Now I think
it all started with a payday loan.

874
00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:36.960 align:center line:-4
You're overdue
on your gas, your electric.

875
00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:40.960 align:center line:-4
It's not easy keeping the lights on,
let alone putting food on the table.

876
00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:43.960 align:center line:-3
Yeah, the stress can eat into you.

877
00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:46.960 align:center line:-4
People come up
with all sorts of crazy schemes.

878
00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:48.960 align:center line:-3
You know that someone killed Zac?

879
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:51.960 align:center line:-4
And we've got CCTV
of you and him looking stressed

880
00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.640 align:center line:-3
the day before he died.

881
00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.960 align:center line:-3
Where were you last Wednesday?

882
00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.960 align:center line:-4
On shift. A million CCTV cameras
to confirm that.

883
00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:03.480 align:center line:-4
Then I got a train to Leeds,
visited my brother.

884
00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.960 align:center line:-4
You have no idea what
it's like working there, do you?

885
00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:12.960 align:center line:-3
The criminals control the place.

886
00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:15.960 align:center line:-4
The gangs, the drugs.
I've been attacked three times.

887
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:18.960 align:center line:-4
Well, it doesn't mean
you can act like a gang yourself.

888
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:19.960 align:center line:-3
How did you extort the money?

889
00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.960 align:center line:-3
Found drugs in his cell.

890
00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:25.960 align:center line:-4
Maybe he'd been pressurised
to hide them there.

891
00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:27.960 align:center line:-3
If I reported him,

892
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:29.960 align:center line:-4
it would've killed
any chance he had of parole.

893
00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:31.960 align:center line:-4
So you asked for money
to keep quiet?

894
00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:36.960 align:center line:-3
How much? Just the thousand?

895
00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.960 align:center line:-4
Two thousand,
in two separate instalments,

896
00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:44.800 align:center line:-3
once he was out. And he paid.

897
00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:48.800 align:center line:-4
He was angry,
but he paid to get rid of me.

898
00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.960 align:center line:-4
And I never saw him again
after that.

899
00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:56.960 align:center line:-4
And you didn't think it prudent
to wait until I got back?

900
00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:57.960 align:center line:-3
Well, if you will just disappear!

901
00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:02.960 align:center line:-4
So you're saying
this officer was blackmailing him?

902
00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.800 align:center line:-4
I'm not even sure
there was any gear.

903
00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.960 align:center line:-4
He scammed a well-behaved prisoner
desperate for parole.

904
00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:07.960 align:center line:-3
We should throw the book at him.

905
00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:10.960 align:center line:-4
Well, hold your horses.
We've gotta check his alibi.

906
00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:14.800 align:center line:-4
He might've been on that train.
And if he wasn't, well, then...

907
00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:20.960 align:center line:-4
Did you say Zac gave him
two payments of a thousand each?

908
00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:24.160 align:center line:-4
Well, we know he got a grand
from the parole officer,

909
00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.960 align:center line:-3
so where'd he get the other one?

910
00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:27.960 align:center line:-4
That's a good point.
STEPH: Ma'am?

911
00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.960 align:center line:-3
And you should've spotted that.

912
00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:35.960 align:center line:1
So, Zac's burner phone
was mainly used to contact Justine.

913
00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.960 align:center line:1
But there's a few other numbers
on there.

914
00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:39.960 align:center line:-3
And one calls Zac several times

915
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.960 align:center line:-4
the day he died
between 7:28 and 9:21pm.

916
00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.960 align:center line:-3
Well, whose number is it?

917
00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:46.960 align:center line:-4
It's a pay-as-you-go phone.
No contract.

918
00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.000 align:center line:-3
But there is something.

919
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.960 align:center line:-4
A few other numbers are saved here
besides Justine.

920
00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:52.960 align:center line:-3
One under the name Imogen.

921
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.480 align:center line:-4
What was it? Justine said
he was looking for a family member?

922
00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.000 align:center line:-3
Isobel or Imelda.

923
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000 align:center line:-4
Ah, well,
could it have been Imogen?

924
00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.960 align:center line:-4
Have you called the number?
Er, yeah.

925
00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:08.160 align:center line:-4
It's for the switchboard
at Rockwick Garrison.

926
00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:11.960 align:center line:-4
There's only one Imogen stationed
there, an Imogen Langworth.

927
00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.960 align:center line:-4
She's a Major in
the Royal Northumberland Artillery.

928
00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.960 align:center line:-3
Why would he want to speak to her?

929
00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:17.960 align:center line:-3
Langworth?

930
00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.160 align:center line:-3
Hold on.

931
00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:25.960 align:center line:-3
Langworth, Langworth.

932
00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:35.960 align:center line:-4
At Corbridge's trial,
his father-in-law gave evidence.

933
00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.960 align:center line:-3
Henry Langworth.

934
00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.960 align:center line:-3
That's Corbridge's daughter.

935
00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:50.480 align:center line:-3
Now, Kenny couldn't trace her.

936
00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:52.800 align:center line:-3
So what if she changed her name?

937
00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.960 align:center line:-4
Anyone over 16 can do it.
It's not even that hard.

938
00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.960 align:center line:-4
You think Amelia Corbridge
is Major Imogen Langworth?

939
00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:01.480 align:center line:-3
Aye. I do.

940
00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:12.960 align:center line:-4
VERA: So, we know for sure, Kenny,
Amelia became Imogen?

941
00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:15.320 align:center line:-4
Yes, ma'am.
She changed her name by deed poll.

942
00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:17.960 align:center line:-4
Er, she actually paid to have
it formally enrolled.

943
00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:22.960 align:center line:-4
So Amelia Corbridge became
Major Imogen Langworth.

944
00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:28.960 align:center line:-3
Thin 'em out.

945
00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:31.960 align:center line:-4
OK, troops. Go and have your break.
Back at half ten.

946
00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.960 align:center line:-3
Major Langworth? DCI Stanhope.

947
00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:39.960 align:center line:-4
DI Ashworth.
Imogen, please.

948
00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:43.160 align:center line:-4
Well, it's good to finally meet.
IMOGEN CHUCKLES

949
00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:45.960 align:center line:-4
It's been a bit of a challenge
finding you.

950
00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:47.960 align:center line:-4
My name change.
Mm.

951
00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.000 align:center line:-3
Yeah, I understand.

952
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.960 align:center line:-4
Can I ask why you've changed it?
Yeah, of course.

953
00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:56.960 align:center line:-4
I struggled for a long time
after what happened.

954
00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:01.960 align:center line:-4
And, er... when I turned it around,
decided to join the Army...

955
00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:04.960 align:center line:-3
..I just wanted a fresh start.

956
00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:05.960 align:center line:-3
Avoid the gossip.

957
00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:11.960 align:center line:-4
The Army became a family to me
after mine became a nightmare.

958
00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:15.320 align:center line:-4
I saw my father's conviction
has been overturned.

959
00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:17.960 align:center line:-4
And you haven't wanted to see him
since he was released?

960
00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:20.960 align:center line:-4
I haven't wanted to see him since
he was jailed for killing me mam.

961
00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:25.960 align:center line:-4
I was close to my dad.
So to see him arrested, convicted...

962
00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:31.960 align:center line:-4
But over time,
I accepted the verdict.

963
00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:34.000 align:center line:-3
Then I put it behind me.

964
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.480 align:center line:-3
And I don't choose to go back there.

965
00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.960 align:center line:-4
Can you tell us
what you remember about that day?

966
00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.960 align:center line:-3
It was just a normal Friday.

967
00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.960 align:center line:-4
I went out.
Er, some youth club thing.

968
00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.960 align:center line:-3
The police found me there.

969
00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.960 align:center line:-3
Dad said it was an accident.

970
00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.960 align:center line:-3
I believed him.

971
00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:55.960 align:center line:-4
But then he was arrested, and I got
sent to live with my aunty Deena.

972
00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:57.960 align:center line:-3
Did you know about your mam's...

973
00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:59.960 align:center line:-4
your mam's affair?
No.

974
00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:02.960 align:center line:-3
Had you ever seen him be violent?

975
00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:06.960 align:center line:-3
Angry, yeah. Not violent.

976
00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:12.960 align:center line:-4
Do you know
a fella called Zachary Martin?

977
00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:15.960 align:center line:-3
Martin. Yeah.

978
00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:18.160 align:center line:-4
Someone called that rang the base
asking for me.

979
00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:19.960 align:center line:-3
I didn't wanna speak to him,

980
00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:21.960 align:center line:-4
the message said
it was about my dad.

981
00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:23.640 align:center line:-3
I just assumed he was a journalist.

982
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:24.960 align:center line:-3
He rang you? Why?

983
00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.960 align:center line:-3
I've no idea.

984
00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.960 align:center line:-3
Are you aware that he died?

985
00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:32.000 align:center line:-3
This Wednesday, he passed.

986
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.960 align:center line:-3
Wait... the day me Dad was released?

987
00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:36.160 align:center line:-3
Aye.

988
00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:38.960 align:center line:-4
Now, I'm gonna have
to ask you this, love.

989
00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:40.960 align:center line:-3
Where were you on Wednesday?

990
00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:44.960 align:center line:-4
I was here on duty.
I can get my CO to confirm for you.

991
00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:47.800 align:center line:-4
That'd be great.
Thanks for your time, pet.

992
00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:55.960 align:center line:-3
Yes, I asked Zac to contact Amelia.

993
00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:58.800 align:center line:-4
Now, you told me
you didn't know where she was!

994
00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.960 align:center line:-4
I said we couldn't put you in touch,
that Amelia had cut off all contact.

995
01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:02.960 align:center line:-3
That was true.

996
01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.960 align:center line:-3
I just wanted to find my own child.

997
01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:10.960 align:center line:-4
Years and years had gone by, and
nothing, and Deena wouldn't help.

998
01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.960 align:center line:-4
Then Remembrance Sunday came along
last year, and...

999
01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.960 align:center line:-4
..on the local news...
I suddenly saw her...

1000
01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.960 align:center line:-4
..doing a reading
for some forces memorial.

1001
01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.960 align:center line:-4
Well, the name on the screen
wasn't hers -

1002
01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.960 align:center line:-3
Major Imogen Langworth.

1003
01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.960 align:center line:-3
But it was my Amelia.

1004
01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.960 align:center line:-4
So you knew she'd changed her name.
I had to be certain.

1005
01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.960 align:center line:-4
Zac said if he could speak to her,
if he could find her,

1006
01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.960 align:center line:-3
he'd let me know.

1007
01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.960 align:center line:-4
I'd just hoped she might talk
to someone outside of the family,

1008
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.960 align:center line:-4
you know, with a bit of distance,
like Zac.

1009
01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.960 align:center line:-3
Well, you should've told us.

1010
01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.000 align:center line:-4
Can I remind you
we're investigating his death?

1011
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.960 align:center line:-4
Well, forgive me for not wanting
to help the police very much!

1012
01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:57.320 align:center line:-4
Did Zac actually speak to her?
Did he meet her?

1013
01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.320 align:center line:-3
Because I'd heard nothing.

1014
01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.960 align:center line:-3
No. She never answered his calls.

1015
01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.960 align:center line:-3
And why wouldn't you help?

1016
01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.960 align:center line:-3
She... She deserted Lucas.

1017
01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.320 align:center line:-3
It was best to just let her go.

1018
01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.960 align:center line:-4
It's not so easy to forget
your own child, Dee.

1019
01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.960 align:center line:-3
Zac understood that.

1020
01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:23.960 align:center line:-4
Aye, it's an amazing link
between him and Zac.

But if Zac never even met
Lucas's daughter, then...

1023
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.320 align:center line:-4
Well, Paula's been looking at
the forensics on the Corbridge case.

1024
01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.960 align:center line:-3
Looks like she's done.

1025
01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.960 align:center line:-4
I thought that might be the Chief
chasing her new Super again. Hm.

1026
01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.960 align:center line:-4
Have you given her an answer yet?
Oh, I don't know, Joe.

1027
01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.800 align:center line:-3
Still thinking.

1028
01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:45.960 align:center line:-4
Senior ranks are more interested
in optics than policing.

1029
01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:46.960 align:center line:-3
So go and change that.

1030
01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.960 align:center line:-4
What, and leave you lot?
Be a blessing for Kenny.

1031
01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.960 align:center line:-3
Hm. Well, there is that.

Listen, Joe, yesterday...
Mark. What's up?

1034
01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.960 align:center line:-4
MARK: 'Er, there's been
an incident.' OK.

1035
01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:00.320 align:center line:-4
Gwen Cobden and Dylan's dad.
All right. I'm headed over.

1036
01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.960 align:center line:-3
Send us an address.

1037
01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:05.960 align:center line:1
What?
Gwen Cobden. Dylan Rowlins' ex.

1038
01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.160 align:center line:1
What? There's been an altercation
between her and Dylan's dad.

1039
01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.960 align:center line:-3
Ah. I'll drop you.

1040
01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.960 align:center line:-3
Get off!

1041
01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.960 align:center line:-4
She's taking advantage of you,
Dylan.

1042
01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.960 align:center line:-3
He's my son.

1043
01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:16.960 align:center line:-3
She's trying to control you.

1044
01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:19.960 align:center line:-4
You OK?
Yeah, ta.

1045
01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.960 align:center line:-3
So? What happened?

1046
01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.960 align:center line:-4
I got in touch with Dylan
after speaking with you,

1047
01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.320 align:center line:-4
and we agreed to a coffee after
one of Dylan's physio sessions.

1048
01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:33.960 align:center line:-4
Then my dad turned up early for me.
Saw Gwen and flew off the handle.

1049
01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:36.960 align:center line:-4
The staff had to intervene.
They called the police.

1050
01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.960 align:center line:-3
Well, I'm glad they did.

1051
01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:40.960 align:center line:-3
He tries to control everything.

1052
01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:44.960 align:center line:-4
Where I go. Who I meet.
He does it with Mum, too.

1053
01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.960 align:center line:-3
Do you think he could've hurt Zac?

1054
01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.960 align:center line:-4
No.
How did he seem last Wednesday?

1055
01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.960 align:center line:-3
He came home from the pub angry.

1056
01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:55.960 align:center line:-4
It'll have been some stupid argument
with someone.

No, no.

1059
01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.960 align:center line:-4
No, it's, erm... not something
I can deal with right now.

1060
01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.960 align:center line:-4
We know that
Marion Corbridge's neck was broken,

1061
01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:10.960 align:center line:-3
plus a severe head trauma.

1062
01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:14.320 align:center line:-4
She consumed alcohol, yes,
but not an excessive amount.

1063
01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.960 align:center line:-3
From the crime scene photos,

1064
01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.960 align:center line:-4
I struggle to see
how she fell without being pushed.

1065
01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.000 align:center line:-3
I could believe Marion was murdered,

1066
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.960 align:center line:-4
but there's
no solid forensic evidence.

1067
01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:23.960 align:center line:-3
It was all circumstantial.

1068
01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:27.960 align:center line:-4
Oh, well, circumstantial evidence
is still evidence, isn't it, Paula?

1069
01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.960 align:center line:-3
If it's beyond reasonable doubt.

1070
01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.960 align:center line:-3
The photos are good. Look at this.

1071
01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:35.480 align:center line:-4
This looks like the cuff mark
from a jumper, maybe?

1072
01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:36.960 align:center line:-3
A hoodie?

1073
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.960 align:center line:-3
Unlikely a paramedic.

1074
01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.960 align:center line:-4
And it wasn't
from Corbridge's jacket...

1075
01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.960 align:center line:-4
You're saying
someone else had been there?

1076
01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.960 align:center line:-3
Likely. Er, but it gets worse.

1077
01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.960 align:center line:-4
And this didn't come out
at the review.

1078
01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.960 align:center line:-4
Fingernail scrapings were taken
from Marion, as standard.

1079
01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.960 align:center line:-4
I pulled all the samples
from storage,

1080
01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.960 align:center line:-3
went through everything,

1081
01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.640 align:center line:-4
and there were fibres recovered
from under her nails.

1082
01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:05.960 align:center line:-4
Well, that didn't make
the path report. Mm-hm.

1083
01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.960 align:center line:-4
So our renowned Doctor Speers
withheld vital evidence?

1084
01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:15.000 align:center line:-4
Maybe it didn't fit his narrative,
like the cuff mark.

1085
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.960 align:center line:-4
Maybe he didn't examine things
properly.

1086
01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.960 align:center line:-4
Malice or incompetence.
Which is worse?

1087
01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.960 align:center line:-4
But these fibres could be
from the poor woman gripping

1088
01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.000 align:center line:-3
whoever it was pushed her.

1089
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.320 align:center line:-3
Could be.

1090
01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.960 align:center line:-4
They're not a match for any clothing
or fabrics found in the house -

1091
01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.960 align:center line:-3
if we trust those searches.

1092
01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.640 align:center line:-4
At the very least, this evidence
should've been disclosed.

1093
01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.000 align:center line:-3
Aye...

1094
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.960 align:center line:-4
and the defence team
would've had a field day.

1095
01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.960 align:center line:-4
I need these fibres analysed.
Already underway.

1096
01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.160 align:center line:-3
Oh. I don't care

1097
01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.960 align:center line:-4
what anyone else says about you,
Paula, you're good.

1098
01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:52.960 align:center line:-3
Ah, that's the boss now.

1099
01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.960 align:center line:-3
Good to work for?

1100
01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.960 align:center line:-4
Eh, what, compared to you?
THEY LAUGH

1101
01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.960 align:center line:-4
Well, nobody's that good.
Aye.

1102
01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.960 align:center line:-3
I was just passing.

1103
01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:05.960 align:center line:-4
I heard Lucas Corbridge
had been linked to another murder.

1104
01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:06.960 align:center line:-3
Ah, you heard that, did you?

1105
01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.640 align:center line:-4
Good to see you, Gary.
Ma'am, I'll let you get on with it.

1106
01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.640 align:center line:-4
Makes it likely we were right
all along, doesn't it now?

1107
01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:19.960 align:center line:-4
Killed his missus.
Now he's killed again.

1108
01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:23.960 align:center line:-4
Except we've found
no motive or opportunity for that.

1109
01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:27.000 align:center line:-4
Oh, he was in jail with this bloke.
Right?

1110
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.960 align:center line:-3
Maybe Corbridge confessed his guilt,

1111
01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.960 align:center line:-4
and so then he had
to get rid of him?

1112
01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:34.960 align:center line:-3
Ah, speculation without evidence.

1113
01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.960 align:center line:-3
That's your MO. Not mine.

1114
01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.960 align:center line:-4
In my day, we just got the job done.
Aye...

1115
01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.960 align:center line:-3
by hiding evidence!

1116
01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.480 align:center line:-3
Evidence? What evidence?

1117
01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:46.960 align:center line:-4
Fibres
under the deceased's fingernails.

1118
01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.960 align:center line:-3
The undisclosed cuff mark.

1119
01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.960 align:center line:-4
They'd have torpedoed your case,
and you know it.

1120
01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.960 align:center line:-4
Fibres? You're asking me
to remember evidence

1121
01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.960 align:center line:-3
from, what, 20-odd years ago?

1122
01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:59.960 align:center line:-4
Ah, well,
luckily, it's not your case now.

1123
01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.960 align:center line:-4
You can get back to your fishing,
pet.

1124
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.960 align:center line:-4
You better hope that nobody pops up
to comb through all your cases

1125
01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.960 align:center line:-4
one of these days, Vera,
accusing you of all sorts.

1126
01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.000 align:center line:-4
If one of my cases
wrongly convicted someone,

1127
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.960 align:center line:-3
I'd want it questioned.

1128
01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.960 align:center line:-3
And damn my reputation.

1129
01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.960 align:center line:-3
Kenny, is that the first time

1130
01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.480 align:center line:-4
you've spoken to Creelan
during this case?

1131
01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:39.480 align:center line:-4
Yes, ma'am. He just walked in.
Front desk called me up.

1132
01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:41.960 align:center line:-3
Just remember whose team you're on.

1133
01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:45.960 align:center line:-3
So, tell us about Gwen Cobden.

1134
01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:49.960 align:center line:-4
Rich Rowlins is a bully and displays
coercive and controlling behaviour.

1135
01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.960 align:center line:-4
Never opened his mouth
when I met him.

1136
01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:53.960 align:center line:-3
But his background check's clear.

1137
01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.960 align:center line:-4
And his alibi
for last Wednesday holds up.

1138
01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:56.960 align:center line:-3
He was at the pub with his mate.

1139
01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:58.960 align:center line:-4
Except I went back
and spoke to the barman.

1140
01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.960 align:center line:-4
He said Rich was there
a couple days earlier.

1141
01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:01.960 align:center line:-3
And he had a run-in with someone.

1142
01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.960 align:center line:-3
"A run-in"? With who?

1143
01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:07.960 align:center line:-4
Well, there's no CCTV at the pub,
but he ID'd a picture of Zac Martin.

1144
01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.800 align:center line:-4
He said he punched the fella
and told him to stay away.

1145
01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.960 align:center line:-3
Well, there's your black eye.

1146
01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:17.320 align:center line:-4
It's clear to me that Zac's death is
about the assault on Dylan Rowlins.

1147
01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.960 align:center line:-4
We know that
Rich punched and threatened him.

1148
01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:22.960 align:center line:-4
So what if a few days later,
he went further and killed him?

1149
01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.000 align:center line:-3
OK. Bring him in.

1150
01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:38.960 align:center line:-3
JOE: CCTV of The Crown. Your local.

1151
01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.960 align:center line:-4
This is you going
in there last Monday.

1152
01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:46.160 align:center line:-4
And this is Zachary Martin,
coming in 30 minutes later.

1153
01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:49.960 align:center line:-4
Now, you told us
you hadn't seen him,

1154
01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:50.960 align:center line:-3
let alone had a fight.

1155
01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.960 align:center line:-3
A fight?

1156
01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.960 align:center line:-4
Well, what else would you call it,
when the lad ends up with a shiner?

1157
01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:59.960 align:center line:-4
Witnesses have told us
you weren't too happy to see Zac.

1158
01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.480 align:center line:-4
There was an argument.
You threw a punch.

1159
01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:05.960 align:center line:-4
Not to mention what you said
you'd do if you saw him again.

1160
01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:09.960 align:center line:-3
Then, two days later, Zac's dead.

1161
01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:13.960 align:center line:-4
Look, love,
your anger is understandable.

1162
01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.800 align:center line:-3
Mm? Why should this lad be out?

1163
01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.960 align:center line:-4
Free. Waltzing into pubs,
while your lad's still suffering?

1164
01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:22.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah. Why should he?
So you did hit him?

1165
01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.960 align:center line:-3
Barely.

1166
01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.960 align:center line:-3
And the threats?

1167
01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.960 align:center line:-4
I just said
I never wanted to see him again...

1168
01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.960 align:center line:-3
..and I didn't.

1169
01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:38.960 align:center line:-3
We know he can lash out.

1170
01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.960 align:center line:-3
Steph, can we break his alibi?

1171
01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.960 align:center line:-4
No, he was definitely
on a roofing job

1172
01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:46.320 align:center line:-4
out towards Blackham
till just after six.

1173
01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:49.960 align:center line:-4
He was on site the whole day,
and then at the pub from 7:30.

1174
01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:52.960 align:center line:-4
Could he have snuck out?
Mark, get on to ANPR.

1175
01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.960 align:center line:-4
Let's see if we can spot his van
on the road. Ma'am.

1176
01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:56.960 align:center line:-3
And I'm going back to this barman,

1177
01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.000 align:center line:-4
and that mate
that Rich said he was with.

1178
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.960 align:center line:-4
Could've been lying for him.
I'll come with you.

1179
01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.960 align:center line:-4
In the meantime,
we'll hang onto him.

1180
01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.960 align:center line:-4
MARK: 'Ma'am, that ANPR check
you asked for.

1181
01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:08.480 align:center line:-4
'There's one number plate
of interest,

1182
01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.960 align:center line:-3
'near Zac Martin's murder site.'

1183
01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.960 align:center line:-4
VERA: Whose vehicle?
'Deena Corbridge's.'

1184
01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:14.960 align:center line:-4
Now tell me
these two cases aren't connected.

1185
01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:32.960 align:center line:-4
Can you remember the fella
I told you about - Zachary Martin?

1186
01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.960 align:center line:-4
On the same wing as your brother.
Oh, yes.

1187
01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:42.960 align:center line:-4
Well, your car was flagged
near to where he died...

1188
01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:44.960 align:center line:-3
..on the night he died.

1189
01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.960 align:center line:-3
What? Where?

1190
01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:50.000 align:center line:-4
Out towards Hulderwood.
Hulderwood?

1191
01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.960 align:center line:-4
Well, I have
a regular bridge evening.

1192
01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.960 align:center line:-4
Ah, well, you'd hardly have been
playing bridge

1193
01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:58.480 align:center line:-4
on the day your brother walks free
from court, now, would you, love?

1194
01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.960 align:center line:-3
No, no, not that day.

1195
01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.960 align:center line:-3
Erm... but yes, I remember.

1196
01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.800 align:center line:-4
I did take a drive that evening.
To clear my head.

1197
01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.960 align:center line:-4
On your own? Lucas not with you?
No.

1198
01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.960 align:center line:-3
Can we ask him ourselves?

1199
01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:13.480 align:center line:-4
He's not here right now.
He's gone out for a walk.

1200
01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:17.960 align:center line:-4
A walk? With his health problems?
What's his mobile number?

1201
01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.960 align:center line:-3
He's only just out of prison.

1202
01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.960 align:center line:-4
DI Ashworth,
get forensics on that car.

1203
01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.960 align:center line:-3
Hold on. You've no right.

1204
01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:28.960 align:center line:-4
This is an invasion of privacy.
If you could remain in the house.

1205
01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:35.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, well, just get them here
as quick as you can, will you?

1206
01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.960 align:center line:-4
I suppose we're gonna let
Rich Rowlins go, then.

1207
01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:43.960 align:center line:-4
Well, if that barman's convinced he
went nowhere on Wednesday evening...

1208
01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:46.960 align:center line:-4
He seemed sure enough to me.
Can't see him lying for Rich.

1209
01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:50.320 align:center line:-3
I, erm...

1210
01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.960 align:center line:-3
I met up with your Jessie.

1211
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.960 align:center line:-4
What? My Jessie? Why?
Cos she's at her wits' end.

1212
01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.480 align:center line:-3
Well, she should talk to me.

1213
01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:59.960 align:center line:-4
Well, it sounds like
they've all tried.

1214
01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.960 align:center line:-3
She's worried about you and Celine.

1215
01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:05.960 align:center line:-3
About the fighting.

1216
01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.320 align:center line:-3
What's going on, Joe?

1217
01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.960 align:center line:-4
Celine's trying to get us to speak
to someone else now.

1218
01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:14.160 align:center line:-4
What, a therapist?
Well, maybe you should.

1219
01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:19.960 align:center line:-4
You're feeling guilty, is that it?
"Guilty"? What for?

1220
01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:22.960 align:center line:-4
For not being there
when your dad passed.

1221
01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.640 align:center line:-3
Well, I had a job to do.

1222
01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:27.800 align:center line:-4
You are putting up a front,
I can see it.

1223
01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:29.960 align:center line:-3
Well, thanks for that (!)

1224
01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:32.800 align:center line:-4
Who needs a therapist
with you around, eh (?)

1225
01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:35.960 align:center line:-3
VERA SIGHS

1226
01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:47.960 align:center line:-4
Any news on Corbridge,
or is he still on walkabout?

1227
01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.960 align:center line:-4
Nothing yet, Ma'am.
Shall I put a formal alert out?

1228
01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:51.960 align:center line:-4
Eh.
PHONE RINGS

1229
01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:55.160 align:center line:-4
We've got confirmed alibis
for his missus,

1230
01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:58.960 align:center line:-4
his parole officer and Prince
Charming himself, Rich Rowlins.

1231
01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:00.960 align:center line:-3
And Greg Wakeley.

1232
01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.960 align:center line:-4
Er, the prison confirmed
he was on shift that day.

1233
01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:06.320 align:center line:-4
And we can place him travelling
to Leeds, visiting his brother.

1234
01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.000 align:center line:-4
Ma'am... that was forensics
from Deena's house.

1235
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.960 align:center line:-4
They've found
Zac Martin's fingerprints.

1236
01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.960 align:center line:-3
What? Where?

1237
01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.960 align:center line:-3
Inside her car.

1238
01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.960 align:center line:-4
They're bringing the vehicle
back for a closer examination.

1239
01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:22.960 align:center line:-4
Right, and now I want
Deena Corbridge brought in an' all.

1240
01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:26.960 align:center line:-4
Now you can put out an alert
for her brother.

1241
01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:28.960 align:center line:-3
DIAL TONE

1242
01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:33.960 align:center line:-3
Deena's being processed.

1243
01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.960 align:center line:-4
A full search of her house
is underway.

1244
01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:39.640 align:center line:-3
Ah, good. Come through.

1245
01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:40.960 align:center line:-3
All right.

1246
01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.960 align:center line:-3
Any info on those blue fibres?

1247
01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.960 align:center line:-4
Mm-hm.
Common synthetic clothing fibres.

1248
01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:48.960 align:center line:-4
Polyester.
Likely from a fleecy sort of top.

1249
01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:51.960 align:center line:-4
But unless we have a garment
to match them to... Oh.

1250
01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.960 align:center line:-3
So, what've you got on the car?

1251
01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:57.960 align:center line:-4
We've got Zac Martin's fingerprints.
Aye, we know that, where are they?

1252
01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:01.960 align:center line:-4
Found on the inside
of the passenger door, here.

1253
01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:04.320 align:center line:-3
So he was in the car.

1254
01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.160 align:center line:-4
Lucas Corbridge's prints
are also on this side.

1255
01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:08.640 align:center line:-3
Ah, well, that makes sense.

1256
01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.960 align:center line:-4
We know Deena drove him home
when he was released.

1257
01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:13.640 align:center line:-4
But Corbridge's prints
are also on the steering wheel.

1258
01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.960 align:center line:-3
He's driven the car?

1259
01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.960 align:center line:-4
The position of the prints
suggests so.

1260
01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:19.960 align:center line:-3
At some point.

1261
01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.960 align:center line:-4
We obviously can't put a date
on any of this.

1262
01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:24.320 align:center line:-4
Well, it has to be in the last week,
Paula.

1263
01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.960 align:center line:-4
Unless the screws let him
out for the occasional spin.

1264
01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.960 align:center line:-4
But we don't know if that was
when Zac was still in the vehicle.

1265
01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:31.960 align:center line:-3
No, but there's one more thing.

1266
01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.160 align:center line:-3
And it does put Zac and the vehicle

1267
01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:34.960 align:center line:-4
in the same place
on the day he died.

1268
01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:36.800 align:center line:-3
What?

1269
01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:41.960 align:center line:-4
In the front grill here...
we found bloodspots.

1270
01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:46.960 align:center line:-4
Zac Martin's blood?
Testing to confirm.

1271
01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.960 align:center line:-4
But if it is, it's likely spatter
from when he was struck and killed.

1272
01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.960 align:center line:-4
So this car was
right there in that car park.

1273
01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.960 align:center line:-3
Along with whoever it was drove it.

1274
01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:03.960 align:center line:-3
Er, Steph, is Deena ready?

1275
01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.960 align:center line:-4
Er, yeah, ma'am,
she's asking about Lucas.

1276
01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.000 align:center line:-4
Seems genuinely worried
about where he's got to.

1277
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.640 align:center line:-4
Kenny's chasing a possible sighting
of him now, Ma'am.

1278
01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:12.960 align:center line:-3
But look at this.

1279
01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:15.960 align:center line:-4
A withdrawal from her account
two days before Zac's death.

1280
01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:20.960 align:center line:-3
'Ey, Mark. That's a belter.

1281
01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.800 align:center line:-4
We found these inside your car,
Deena.

1282
01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.960 align:center line:-3
Zac Martin's fingerprints.

1283
01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:32.320 align:center line:-3
How'd they get there?

1284
01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:37.960 align:center line:-3
All right, what about this?

1285
01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:42.000 align:center line:-4
On Monday, you withdrew a thousand
pounds in cash from your bank.

1286
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.960 align:center line:-4
What was that for?
Did Zachary Martin ask for it?

1287
01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.960 align:center line:-4
Did he threaten you or your brother?
No.

1288
01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:52.000 align:center line:-4
No, it's just to...
make him go away.

1289
01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:57.960 align:center line:-4
Stop all this nonsense
about getting in touch with Amelia.

1290
01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.960 align:center line:-4
Lucas should've told him
I wasn't going to help.

1291
01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:01.960 align:center line:-4
Cos you didn't want them
back in touch.

1292
01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:04.960 align:center line:-3
They've totally separate lives.

1293
01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.960 align:center line:-3
I told Zac it should stay that way.

1294
01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:13.960 align:center line:-4
I gave him money for his trouble...
and he went away.

1295
01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.960 align:center line:-3
The problem being...

1296
01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:22.320 align:center line:-4
that's not the only evidence
we found in your vehicle.

1297
01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:23.960 align:center line:-3
We found bloodspots.

1298
01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:28.960 align:center line:-4
An initial analysis suggests
that's Zachary Martin's blood,

1299
01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:33.480 align:center line:-4
which means your car was there
when he was killed.

1300
01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:36.160 align:center line:-4
Cos you told us you went for a drive
last Wednesday.

1301
01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.960 align:center line:-3
Did you meet Zac?

1302
01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:40.960 align:center line:-4
SOFTLY: No! No, I...
No?

1303
01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.640 align:center line:-4
Anyone else driven your car
in the last week?

1304
01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:45.960 align:center line:-4
No.
How about your brother?

1305
01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.960 align:center line:-3
Did he go for a spin?

1306
01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:53.960 align:center line:-4
Because we've got his finger prints
on the steering wheel. No.

1307
01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:56.960 align:center line:-3
My brother isn't a murderer.

1308
01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:00.640 align:center line:-4
Did he drive your car
on Wednesday evening?

1309
01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:07.960 align:center line:-3
He asked to borrow it.

1310
01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:12.960 align:center line:-4
He said he had to get out.
Feel some freedom.

1311
01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.960 align:center line:-3
He was only gone an hour.

1312
01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:17.960 align:center line:-4
But he met Zac?
I don't know. I don't know!

1313
01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:19.960 align:center line:-3
SHE SIGHS

1314
01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.960 align:center line:-4
When we got back from court,
there was a package.

1315
01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:26.960 align:center line:-4
What package?
At the house.

1316
01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:28.960 align:center line:-3
Addressed to Lucas.

1317
01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.000 align:center line:-3
Someone must've dropped it off.

1318
01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:35.960 align:center line:-4
And I didn't see him open it,
but later...

1319
01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.480 align:center line:-3
when he was in his room,

1320
01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.960 align:center line:-4
I heard him talking,
like he was on a phone.

1321
01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:44.960 align:center line:-4
Well, she said
her brother didn't have a mobile.

1322
01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:47.960 align:center line:-4
But what if Zac delivered one
in that package?

1323
01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:51.960 align:center line:-4
The pay-as-you-go number that rang
Zac was Lucas trying to meet.

1324
01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:54.960 align:center line:-4
But when the two of them did meet,
Corbridge killed him. Why?

1325
01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:57.960 align:center line:-4
Well, we need to find him
and ask him.

1326
01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:00.960 align:center line:-4
These two cases
couldn't be more linked.

1327
01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:06.800 align:center line:-4
Steph, that pay-as-you-go phone
that rang Zac's secret phone,

1328
01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:07.960 align:center line:-3
has it been used again?

1329
01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:09.320 align:center line:-3
I don't think so. I'll check.

1330
01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:13.960 align:center line:-4
Yeah, ma'am? Pictures of what was
found hidden in Deena's loft.

1331
01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:16.960 align:center line:-4
It's all been
bagged and photographed

1332
01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:21.960 align:center line:-4
Right. Now, what's this?
Presumably one of Deena's tops.

1333
01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:27.960 align:center line:-4
Is that blood?
Yeah, that's what forensics think.

1334
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.960 align:center line:-4
And this was found in Deena's loft?
Ma'am.

1335
01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:41.960 align:center line:-4
Well, my money's on Paula confirming
that blood's a match

1336
01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.000 align:center line:-3
for Marion Corbridge.

1337
01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.960 align:center line:-4
And those fibres found
under her finger nails

1338
01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.320 align:center line:-3
are from this garment.

1339
01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:50.960 align:center line:-3
So we've got her?

1340
01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.160 align:center line:-4
But what would be
her motive for killing her?

1341
01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:06.960 align:center line:-3
She didn't.

1342
01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.800 align:center line:-4
Is something wrong?
Have you found Lucas?

1343
01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:22.320 align:center line:-4
No, but we've found a blue top.
A bloodstained one.

1344
01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.960 align:center line:-3
It's Amelia's, isn't it?

1345
01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:29.960 align:center line:-3
Amelia was there when her mam died.

1346
01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.960 align:center line:-3
Now, did she push her?

1347
01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:34.960 align:center line:-3
Did she kill Marion?

1348
01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.960 align:center line:-3
And her dad never knew,

1349
01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:39.640 align:center line:-4
and that's why
you've kept them apart.

1350
01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:42.640 align:center line:-4
It's only because of her
Lucas was locked up.

1351
01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:45.960 align:center line:-4
You could've told the police this.
Set Lucas free.

1352
01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.960 align:center line:-3
What, by jailing his daughter?

1353
01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.960 align:center line:-4
You think
he'd ever have forgiven me?

1354
01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:55.960 align:center line:-4
What, instead,
you watched an innocent man

1355
01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:57.960 align:center line:-3
get banged up for 20 years?

1356
01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:59.640 align:center line:-3
I stood by him.

1357
01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:01.960 align:center line:-4
And I supported him
as he fought to get out.

1358
01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:05.000 align:center line:-4
Lucas understands what I did.
You withheld the truth, love.

1359
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.960 align:center line:-4
Perverted the course of justice.
And you're gonna lose him again.

1360
01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:12.960 align:center line:-4
Now, did you tell Zachary Martin
what Amelia had done?

1361
01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:14.960 align:center line:-3
No. No.

1362
01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:17.960 align:center line:-3
But he...

1363
01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:21.000 align:center line:-4
..he asked again and again
why I wouldn't help.

1364
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.960 align:center line:-4
What had Amelia done
that was so bad.

1365
01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.320 align:center line:-3
I said too much.

1366
01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:32.800 align:center line:-4
I said it was all her fault.
And he worked it out.

1367
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.640 align:center line:-4
So, the lad takes Deena's money
to walk away,

1368
01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.800 align:center line:-3
but he must've agonised over it.

1369
01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:45.960 align:center line:-4
There's his mate,
languishing in prison,

1370
01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:47.960 align:center line:-4
not knowing if
his case is gonna be overturned...

1371
01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:49.960 align:center line:-4
That's probably what drove him
to the pub

1372
01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:52.960 align:center line:-4
that night
Rich Rowlins smacked him one.

1373
01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:55.640 align:center line:-4
Well, it must've knocked some sense
into him,

1374
01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:58.960 align:center line:-4
because the minute Corbridge
is released,

1375
01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.960 align:center line:-4
the lad decides to tell him,
on the qt,

1376
01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:03.960 align:center line:-3
exactly what happened to his wife.

1377
01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.960 align:center line:-3
So he delivers a cheap mobile phone

1378
01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.000 align:center line:-4
in order to set-up a meeting
with him.

1379
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.960 align:center line:-4
Well, he couldn't rock up
to the house, could he?

1380
01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.960 align:center line:-4
She wouldn't let him near.
Steph, the pay-as-you-go?

1381
01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:14.640 align:center line:-4
Er, no calls this afternoon, ma'am.
But then there was one...

1382
01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.960 align:center line:-3
To Rockwick Garrison?

1383
01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:17.960 align:center line:-4
That's just where we're going.
Get your coat.

1384
01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.960 align:center line:-4
Tell them we're on our way.
Ma'am.

1385
01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.960 align:center line:-4
All right. Let us know.
What?

1386
01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.960 align:center line:-4
Steph says that
Imogen left the base.

1387
01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.640 align:center line:-4
They don't know where she is.
Ah.

1388
01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:31.960 align:center line:-4
Great, now we've lost
Corbridge and her.

1389
01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:32.960 align:center line:-3
Aye, well, they're together.

1390
01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:34.960 align:center line:-4
Well, of course they're together,
but where?

1391
01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:37.960 align:center line:-4
Well, Kenny's lead was
a sighting of Lucas on a bus.

1392
01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:39.960 align:center line:-4
Ellingmouth Road,
heading toward the coast.

1393
01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.960 align:center line:-3
Well, that's back the other way.

1394
01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:43.960 align:center line:-3
VERA GROANS

1395
01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:47.160 align:center line:-4
So, she really killed
her own mother?

1396
01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:50.960 align:center line:-3
Unthinkable, isn't it? 15-year-old.

1397
01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:51.960 align:center line:-3
Well, that's probably why

1398
01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:54.960 align:center line:-4
she was never properly looked at
in the first place.

1399
01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:56.960 align:center line:-3
Aye, her dad was a much better bet.

1400
01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:59.960 align:center line:-4
Aye, well,
DCI Creelan picked his man,

1401
01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:02.960 align:center line:-3
and Speers made the forensics fit.

1402
01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:04.960 align:center line:-4
What a sorry mess.
PHONE RINGS

1403
01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:07.160 align:center line:-4
Kenny?
KENNY: 'We've found Imogen's car.'

1404
01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:08.960 align:center line:-3
They've found Imogen's car.

1405
01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:11.480 align:center line:-4
All right, stay there.
We're on our way.

1406
01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:27.960 align:center line:-4
Any sign of her or Corbridge?
Ah, not yet, ma'am.

1407
01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:30.960 align:center line:-4
But it is her car.
Well, get back-up here.

1408
01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:32.960 align:center line:-3
They're already on the way, ma'am.

1409
01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:34.640 align:center line:-4
I'll check the beach.
OK.

1410
01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:38.960 align:center line:-4
No. You wait here, Kenny,
in case she comes back.

1411
01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.960 align:center line:-3
Ma'am.

1412
01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:05.960 align:center line:-3
Imogen?

1413
01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:10.800 align:center line:-4
You all right, pet,
up here on your own?

1414
01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:13.960 align:center line:-3
Your dad not here?

1415
01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.000 align:center line:-3
No.

1416
01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:20.960 align:center line:-3
He was. He's gone now.

1417
01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:25.320 align:center line:-4
But he called you?
Arranged to meet you here?

1418
01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.960 align:center line:-4
This is
where Mam's ashes were scattered.

1419
01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.960 align:center line:-4
Now, you're gonna have to come
with me, pet.

1420
01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:41.480 align:center line:-4
No.
OK.

1421
01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:42.960 align:center line:-4
Do you wanna tell me
what took you home

1422
01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:44.960 align:center line:-3
from the youth club that evening?

1423
01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:47.960 align:center line:-3
It was just a stupid teen disco.

1424
01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.960 align:center line:-4
There were loads of kids.
It was easy to slip away.

1425
01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:55.000 align:center line:-3
There was this girl I didn't like.

1426
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.960 align:center line:-3
She said she'd seen my mam

1427
01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:01.960 align:center line:-4
coming out of a hotel
with some posh-looking bloke.

1428
01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:02.960 align:center line:-3
She was laughing about it.

1429
01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:05.800 align:center line:-3
But you must've suspected something,

1430
01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.960 align:center line:-4
otherwise,
you wouldn't have believed her.

1431
01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:10.960 align:center line:-3
It made sense of stuff. Yeah. Erm...

1432
01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.960 align:center line:-3
Phone calls Mam hid.

1433
01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:15.960 align:center line:-3
Things Dad didn't see.

1434
01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:19.960 align:center line:-3
So, you went home... and...?

1435
01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:22.960 align:center line:-3
And, erm... I found Mam upstairs.

1436
01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:26.480 align:center line:-3
I hoped she'd deny it.

1437
01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:28.960 align:center line:-3
Say it was just... stupid gossip.

1438
01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:33.960 align:center line:-3
But she'd been drinking... as usual.

1439
01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:37.960 align:center line:-4
Oh. And she didn't deny it?
She got angry.

1440
01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:43.960 align:center line:-4
Said I didn't know how it felt
to be ignored by your own husband.

1441
01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.320 align:center line:-3
She said she was gonna leave my dad.

1442
01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:57.960 align:center line:-3
Take me with her.

1443
01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.800 align:center line:-3
TEARFULLY: So I pushed her.

1444
01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:06.960 align:center line:-3
Erm... hard.

1445
01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.960 align:center line:-3
And then she went backward.

1446
01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:14.960 align:center line:-4
She was there,
and then... she's gone.

1447
01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.960 align:center line:-3
The sound as she hit the floor...

1448
01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:21.640 align:center line:-3
SHE SOBS

1449
01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:42.960 align:center line:-3
SHE SOBS

1450
01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:46.480 align:center line:-4
And you went downstairs to your mam,
didn't you?

1451
01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:49.960 align:center line:-3
Cos you got her blood on your top.

1452
01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:51.960 align:center line:-3
Was that from trying to revive her?

1453
01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.160 align:center line:-3
She was already dead.

1454
01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:59.800 align:center line:-3
I just... left.

1455
01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.960 align:center line:-4
I couldn't tell my dad
that I'd pushed her,

1456
01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.640 align:center line:-3
he was already heartbroken.

1457
01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.960 align:center line:-4
I was terrified that the police
were gonna come back for me.

1458
01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:08.960 align:center line:-4
No, and instead,
they came for your dad.

1459
01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:12.000 align:center line:-4
But I knew he would be exonerated
because...

1460
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.960 align:center line:-3
because he didn't do it.

1461
01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.960 align:center line:-3
And when he was convicted?

1462
01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:18.160 align:center line:-3
That was when I broke. I...

1463
01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:19.960 align:center line:-3
I told me Auntie Deena.

1464
01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:22.960 align:center line:-4
She knew the truth would be
a worse sentence

1465
01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.960 align:center line:-3
than your dad had already got.

1466
01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:27.160 align:center line:-3
My dad's been through enough.

1467
01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:30.960 align:center line:-4
20 years of hell.
He... He should be free.

1468
01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:31.960 align:center line:-3
That's as may be, love.

1469
01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.960 align:center line:-3
Now, where is he? Where's your dad?

1470
01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:37.960 align:center line:-3
He's gone.

1471
01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:40.480 align:center line:-4
I gave him my keys and...
Amelia, step away from her.

1472
01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:46.960 align:center line:-4
No.
Dad, I told you to go! Get away!

1473
01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:48.960 align:center line:-3
Mr Corbridge.

1474
01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.960 align:center line:-4
We know
what you did to Zachary Martin.

1475
01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:54.960 align:center line:-4
He told you what had really happened
with your wife, didn't he?

1476
01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:58.800 align:center line:-4
And you killed him
to stop him reporting it to us.

1477
01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:00.160 align:center line:-3
I won't go back inside.

1478
01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.800 align:center line:-3
I won't let her go either.

1479
01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:06.960 align:center line:-4
I had to stop Zac
to protect you, Amelia.

1480
01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:08.960 align:center line:-3
It's all over.

1481
01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:10.960 align:center line:-3
I've got back-up on their way,

1482
01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:12.960 align:center line:-4
and I've an officer
on your daughter's vehicle.

1483
01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:14.960 align:center line:-3
Not any more you haven't.

1484
01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.960 align:center line:-3
I didn't wanna hurt anyone...

1485
01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:22.960 align:center line:-4
..and I don't wanna hurt
anyone else.

1486
01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:23.960 align:center line:-3
Lucas Corbridge!

1487
01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:24.960 align:center line:-4
Don't!
Stop there!

1488
01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:26.480 align:center line:-3
Dad, no!

1489
01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:29.960 align:center line:-4
Joe, what are you doing?
Dad, please!

1490
01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:30.960 align:center line:-3
Amelia.

1491
01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:32.960 align:center line:-4
Dad. Dad.
Joe!

1492
01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:34.960 align:center line:-4
Leave her alone, man, it's over!
WATCH OUT!

1493
01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:38.640 align:center line:-4
Help!
No!

1494
01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:40.960 align:center line:-3
HE HYPERVENTILATES

# I defy thee... #

1505
01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:24.960 align:center line:-3
Kenny! Kenny!

1506
01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:27.960 align:center line:-3
Kenny, can you hear me?

1507
01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.640 align:center line:-3
Oh, please, please, please.

1508
01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:34.000 align:center line:-3
# I defy thee... #

1509
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.960 align:center line:-3
Kenny, love.

1510
01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:40.000 align:center line:-3
# Oh, the magpie brings us tidings

1511

News of the harvest

1515
01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:59.800 align:center line:-3
# Of the barley, wheat and corn

1516
01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:02.960 align:center line:-4

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:28.320 align:center line:-3

1527
01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:41.960 align:center line:-4
Oh, well, when he wakes up...
will you tell him I called?

1528
01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:44.960 align:center line:-3
Aye.

1529
01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:46.800 align:center line:-3
Thanks, love.

1530
01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:51.160 align:center line:-4
How is he?
Well, he's not out of the woods.

1531
01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.960 align:center line:-3
I've got an officer in hospital,

1532
01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:55.960 align:center line:-4
and I've still got to justify
our actions

1533
01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:59.960 align:center line:-4
up on that clifftop,
with a perpetrator dead.

1534
01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:02.960 align:center line:-4
And worse...
that could've been you, Joe!

1535
01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:04.640 align:center line:-3
What were you thinking?

1536
01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:06.960 align:center line:-4
Lucas was coming towards you.
I was trying to protect you.

1537
01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:08.960 align:center line:-3
It was reckless.

1538
01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:12.960 align:center line:-4
You've been behaving erratically,
and...

1539
01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:16.160 align:center line:-4
and I think your missus is right,
I think you need to see someone.

1540
01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:19.320 align:center line:-4
Wait. Are you trying to link
what happened up there with my dad?

1541
01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:21.960 align:center line:-4
Are you serious?
Why're you so obsessed with it?

1542
01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:24.960 align:center line:-4
I just need to know
you're going to be OK.

1543
01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.960 align:center line:-3
If you move on? Is that it?

1544
01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:28.960 align:center line:-3
So really this is about you.

1545
01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:31.320 align:center line:-3
You've got to forgive yourself, Joe.

1546
01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:34.960 align:center line:-3
Don't lose your family.

1547
01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.000 align:center line:-4
Coming from a woman
who never had one...

1548
01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:41.640 align:center line:-4
..and never processed
