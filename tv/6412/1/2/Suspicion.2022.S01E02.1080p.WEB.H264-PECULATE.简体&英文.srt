见到你真高兴
So lovely to meet you.

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,950
糟糕 我希望那不…
I hope it wasn't--

（伦敦市 主教门警察局）

15

乔普拉先生 你涉嫌串谋劫持而被捕
Mr. Chopra, you've been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to abduct.

16
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,370
本次谈话将进行录音和录像
This interview will be recorded with both video and audio.

17
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,380
我必须提醒你 你什么都不必说
I have to remind you that you don't have to say anything,

18
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,750
但若在接受讯问时隐瞒了信息 而将来在法庭上
but it may harm your defense if you do not mention when questioned

19
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,960
你要依靠这些信息 这可能对你的辩护不利
something which you later rely on in court.

20
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,260
你所说的一切可能被用作证据
Anything you do say may be given in evidence.

21
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,050
我知道已经问过你了 不过为了录像再问你一次
I know you've already been asked, but for the sake of the camera,

22
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,800
你确定你不需要有律师在场吗 
are you sure you don't want legal representation?

23
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,560
我不需要 显然是某种误会
I don't need it. There's obviously been some sort of misunderstanding.

24
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,890
我们走着瞧吧
Well, we'll see.

25
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,650
我会对你实话实说 希望你也能这样
I'm gonna be honest with you in the hope that you'll reciprocate.

26
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,730
没时间玩游戏
No time for games.

27
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,240
我们有理由相信 一个年轻人的生命危在旦夕
We have reason to believe a young man's life is at risk.

28
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,320
如实回答我的问题 我会帮助你
Answer my questions honestly, and I'll help you.

29
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,870
如果对我说谎 我就无能无力了

里奥纽曼在哪里 
Where is Leo Newman?

31
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,120
-我一无所知 -这是认真的吗 
-I have absolutely no idea. -Is this for real?

32
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,960
他在英国境内吗 
Is he here in the UK?

33
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,590
这不是什夫的恶作剧 
This isn't Shiv winding me up?

34
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,220
是 我是说 无可奉告
Yeah, I mean, no comment.

35
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,470
哪个里奥 
Leo who?

36
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,680
你认识这个吗 
Do you recognize this?

37
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,480
里奥自从被塞进那个行李箱后 没有人见过他或听到他的消息
Leo hasn't been seen or heard of since being bundled into that suitcase.

38
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,230
这些面具有什么意义 
What's the significance of the masks?

39
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,360
我不知道 我从来没听说过里奥牛顿
I don't know. I've never even heard of Leo Newton.

40
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,910
纽曼
Newman.

41
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,490
你不可能认为是我绑架了他吧
Can't seriously think I kidnapped him.

42
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,040
劫持只有在收到赎金要求或活着的证明时
Abduction is only classified as kidnap once a ransom demand

43
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,000
才被归类为绑架
or proof of life has been received.

44
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,620
在知道戴面具者想要什么之前
Until we know what the people in the masks want,

45
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,670
我们无法确定这是否与恐怖分子有关
we can't be certain whether this is terrorist-related,

46
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,130
是否有政治动机或就是简单的敲诈勒索
politically motivated or simple extortion.

47
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,890
-你在问我吗  -你知道吗 
-Are you asking me? -Do you know?

48
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,180
你认为我蠢到没有律师在场 坐在这里回答问题
Do you think I'd be stupid enough to do this without a solicitor

49
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,470
如果我参与其中的话 
if I was involved?

50
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,770
这也同样可以被理解为你很聪明
Well, it could equally be construed as very smart.

51
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,730
我什么时候能离开这里 
When can I get out of here?

52

我妈妈要急疯了
My mum is gonna be in a right state.

我们的美国朋友 你只不过是一名财务经理
our American friends you're nothing more than a finance manager

碰上了倒霉的一天
having a really bad day,

56
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,700
我们几小时之内就能让你离开 好吗 
and we'll get you out of here in a matter of hours, okay?

57
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,540
“好吗” 
"Okay"?

58
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,120
为了今天我准备了两年
Today took two years to plan.

59
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,460
人们从世界各地赶来 花了超出预算的钱
People came from all over the world, spent money they haven't got.

60
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,380
所以不 实际上我现在的状况 跟“好”差了十万八千里
So, no. Actually, I'm about as far from "okay" as I could possibly be right now.

61
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,840
来吧
Come on.

62
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,090
问你的问题吧
Ask your questions,

63
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,350
然后我会咨询我的未婚夫 他碰巧是一名律师
and then I'll consult my fiancé, who happens to be a lawyer,

64
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,730
你到底得花多少钱 才能让这事“好”起来
about exactly how much it's gonna cost you to make this anything like "okay."

65
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,610
你认识这个人吗 
Do you know this man?

66
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,240
从来没见过
Never seen him before.

67
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,320
无可奉告
No comment.

68
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,790
他是谁 
Who is he?

69
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,410
你知道他现在可能在哪里吗 
Do you have any idea where he might be now?

00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,820
你好 爷爷
Hello, Granda.

Son.

74
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,620
告诉我从你到达美国那一刻所有的行踪
Give me a full account from the time you arrived in America.

75
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,380
我从机场搭德士到酒店和我妹妹见面
I got a cab from the airport and met my sister at the hotel.

76
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,510
-莫妮克  -她在上纽约大学
-Monique? -She's at NYU.

77
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,880
我从来没去过 所以计划晚上出去玩
I've never been over, so the plan was to have a night out,

78
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,760
算是告别单身派对吧 然后带她一起回来
sort of hen party, and then bring her back.

79
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,430
-她也在这里吗  -请继续
-Is she here too? -Keep going, please.

80
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,190
房间还没准备好 所以我们就去参观了一些景点
The room wasn't ready yet, so we went and saw some sights.

81
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,440
买了些东西 然后莫妮回了她自己的住处
Did some shopping, and then Mon went back to her place.

82
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,980
我回了酒店
I went back to the hotel.

83
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,070
这是几点钟 
What time was this?

84
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,950
大约5点
5:00-ish?

85
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:31,990
然后呢 
And then?

86
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,580
我安排了跟莫妮7点30在一个酒吧碰头
I'd arranged to meet Mon at a bar at 7:30,

87
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,330
所以 我打开了行李 休息了一下
so I unpacked and chilled for a bit.

88
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,540
你又离开过房间吗 
And did you leave again

89
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,540
在回到酒店和去酒吧之间
between arriving back and going to the bar?

90
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,420
我记得去了水疗中心
I think I went to the spa.

91
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,000
是 我…离开过
Yeah, I did.

92
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,840
不过 当我到更衣室的时候
But when I got to the changing room,

93
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,720
莫妮给我发短信说 我们应该在酒店喝杯鸡尾酒
Mon texted and said we should get a cocktail at the hotel

94
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,100
在她朋友到达之前
before her friends turned up.

95
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,060
你没用水疗中心就离开了 
-So you left without using the spa?

96
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,140
对
-Yes.

97
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,190
你在酒店各处走动的时候 有没有遇到其他人 
And did you meet anyone else as you moved around the hotel?

98
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,030
我收拾好然后和莫妮见面了
I got ready and met Mon.

99
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,320
你得去问莫妮克和她的朋友
And you'll have to speak to Monique and her friends

100
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,610
在那之后我们去了哪里
about where we went after that.

101
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,820
我只知道 有好多酒吧
All I know is, there were a lot of bars,

102
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,530
一个夜总会、跳舞、香槟
a club, dancing, champagne,

103
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,750
一些非常贵的迷你小汉堡 由几个以为他们泡到姑娘的家伙付的钱
some seriously expensive sliders paid for by some guys who thought they'd pulled.

104
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,790
当晚你有没有在任何时间 离开过你的同伴 
Were you away from your party at any point in the evening?

105
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,880
没有 我是说 我去过厕所 不过…
No. Well, I mean, I went to the loo, but…

106
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,760
-电话呢  -我可能给乔发了短信
-Phone calls? -I probably texted Joe.

107
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,420
你有我的电话 你可以查
You have my phone. You can check it.

108
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,840
你什么时候回到了酒店 
What time did you return to the hotel?

109
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,550
我根本不记得
I have no idea.

110
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,300
我喝多了
I drank way too much.

111
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,730
我在夜总会离开了莫妮和她朋友 她直接去的机场
I left Mon and her friends at the club, and she went straight to the airport.

112
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,350
大约什么时候
Estimate.

113
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,600
我连回去的过程都不记得
I can't even remember getting back.

114
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,440
我知道我叫了辆德士 回到了我的房间
I know I got a cab, made it back to my room,

115
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,650
接下来我只记得我的闹铃响了
but the next thing I remember is my alarm going off,

116
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,530
到了该去机场的时间
saying it was time to go to the airport.

117
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,950
闭路电视监控没有你回到酒店的记录
There's no CCTV of you returning to the hotel.

118
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,620
我想有一个…边门
There was a side door, I think.

119
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,120
一个没有摄像头监控的边门 
A side door not covered by a camera?

120
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,620
这么说你不相信我
So you don't believe me.

121
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,170
纽约这么远 而你只待了这么短时间
New York is a long way to go for such a short trip.

122
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,420
你一定明白这看起来有多奇怪
You must see how odd that looks.

123
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,920
我在告别单身之夜只想和我妹妹在一起
My sister is the only person I wanted to spend my hen night with.

124
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,340
这有什么奇怪 她是我最好的朋友
What's so odd about that? She's my best friend.

125
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,100
（到处都是娜塔的流言 恐怖主义 怎么回事 ）

126
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,230
（别傻了 当然不是）

127
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,870
-嘿 乔 -嘿 警察在这里
-Hey, Joe. -Hey. The police are here.

128
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,030
-发生了什么事  -我现在还不知道
-What's going on? -Well, I don't know yet.

129
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
我在给可能知道的人打电话 可大家都在睡觉
I'm calling people who might, but the world's asleep.

130
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,250
我的朋友们在酒店 我正要过去
My lot are at the hotel. I'm heading there now.

131
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,460
保持联系
You can just keep in touch.

132
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,920
如果听到什么消息给我电话 好吗  我也会这么做
Call me if you hear anything, okay? I'll do the same.

133
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,380
谢谢 莫妮
Thanks, Mon.

134
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,010
好吧
Okay.

135

我真希望能留下
I wish I could stay.

167

辨识任何事物的客观真理是什么

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,150
我代表大学感谢基金会
On behalf of the university, I'd like to thank the foundation.

272
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,700
那看上去不像有时差
That doesn't look like jet lag.

273
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,990
像是一个因为自己其实讨厌的礼物 不得不说感谢话的人
That looks like someone having to say thanks for a present they actually hate.

274
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,700
有什么好笑的 
Something funny?

275
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,960
只是在想我女儿
Just thinking about my daughter.

276
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,630
不好笑 不
Not funny. No.

277
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,880
塔拉 你认识里奥纽曼吗 
Do you know Leo Newman, Tara?

278
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,840
不认识
No, I don't.

279
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,930
从未见过 
Never met him?

280
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,010
没见过
No.

281
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,180
但你知道他在你的大学就读 对吗 
But you knew he was studying at the university, didn't you?

282
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:45,930
对吗 
Didn't you?

283
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,730
-是的 -因为你抗议了
-Yes. -Because you protested

284
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,350
反对他的录取
against his admission.

285
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,900
我不确定“抗议”是正确的用词
I'm not sure if "protested" is the right word.

286
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,820
我质疑了在基金会的捐款和录取里奥之间
I questioned whether there was a link between the money from the foundation

287
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,110
是否有联系
and Leo being awarded a place.

288
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,530
看来你在校园里造成了不小的风波
Looks like you kicked up quite a fuss on campus.

289
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,780
而且你把它透露给了媒体
And you leaked it to the media.

290
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,320
这种事必须透明 否则大家都会受影响
These things have to be transparent, or everyone suffers.

291
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,200
然而你一定得罪了许多人
Still, you must have annoyed a lot of people.

292
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,410
包括你的上司
Including your bosses.

293
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,910
那是搞学术的地方
It's a place of learning.

294
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,120
人们相信为信念挺身而出的重要性
People see the importance of standing up for what you believe in.

295
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,880
你的信念是什么 
Which is what, in your case?

296
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,920
择优录取
Meritocracy.

297
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,380
然后发生了什么 
So, what happened?

298
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,300
学院进行了调查 他们没有发现不当行为的证据
There was a college investigation. They found no evidence of wrongdoing.

299
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,140
所以里奥被录取是应该的 
So, Leo was there on merit?

300
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,220
是的
Yes.

301
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,930
-你肯定不认识他  -不认识
-And you definitely don't know him? -No.

302
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,150
这很奇怪 因为他好像认识你
That is strange, because he seems to know you.

303
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,650
我们的美国同事找到了里奥的笔记本电脑
Our colleagues in America recovered a laptop of Leo's

304
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,860
你的名字经常出现在他的课堂笔记里
on which your name appears regularly in his lecture notes.

305
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,120
我无法控制谁来听我的讲座
I have no control over who sits in on my lectures.

306
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,580
好吧 当我第一次提到他名字时 你为什么没有告诉我
Okay. Why didn't you tell me

307
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,910
你和里奥之间的联系 
about your connection with Leo when I first mentioned his name?

308
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,910
我们没有“联系” 我只是提出了质疑
There is no "connection." I raised concerns.

309
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,830
他们调查了 是我错了
They were investigated. I was wrong.

310
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,920
你不觉得奇怪 在那么多人中 偏偏是你
And you don't think it looks odd that you should go

311
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,960
去向库珀纽曼致敬
and pay homage to Cooper Newman?

312
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,590
那都是过去的事了
It's old news.

313
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,590
我还有更重要的事要操心
I have more important things to worry about.

314
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,410
蓝色知更鸟控股公司
Blue Robin Holdings.

315
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:34,710
什么 
What?

316
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,830
认识这个名字吗 
Recognize the name?

317
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,340
-不 -我们在查看你的电脑
-No. -We're looking at computers

318
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,710
你家里和办公室的电脑
from your home and your workplace.

319
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,920
在你的个人电脑中存有 蓝色知更鸟控股公司的银行详情
You have Blue Robin Holdings bank details saved on your personal laptop.

320
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,430
看起来他们定期将存款打入
It seems they make regular deposits

321
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,850
一个注册地址在沃克斯豪尔的 公共建筑的帐户中
to an account registered at a public building in Vauxhall.

322
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,850
我对此一无所知 我得…
Don't know anything about that. I'll--

323
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,230
我得查一下
I'll have to look into it.

324
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,940
对 我们也会查
Yeah, so will we.

325
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
（欧文尼尔森来电）

326
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,570
喂
Hey.

327
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,700
斯科特 我没收到你的最新信息
I'm not seeing updates from you, Scott.

328
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,620
现在还没有太多信息 正在审讯嫌疑人
There's not a lot to say yet. The suspects are still being questioned.

329
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,950
显然不是你在讯问
Well, obviously not by you.

330
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,620
不是我 有一些司法管辖权的问题
No. There are some issues around jurisdiction.

331
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,710
真的吗 
Really?

332
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,880
更大的问题是一个孩子在48小时前被劫持
There's a bigger issue around a kid that was snatched 48 hours ago,

333
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,340
我们还是不知道是谁干的或动机是什么
and we still have no idea who took him or why,

334
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,340
更不用说他现在在哪里 我的时间不多
let alone where he is right now. I don't have a lot of time here.

335
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,760
是的 我明白
Yeah, I understand that.

336
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,260
是吗 
Do you?

337
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,890
你认为
How long do you think

338
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,640
地球上最大的传播机构的老板
the head of the biggest communications agency on the planet

339
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,520
能同意让她儿子被劫持这件事保密多久 
is going to agree to keep her son's abduction quiet?

340
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,610
斯科特 网上刚披露了 行李箱里的孩子名叫里奥纽曼
The Internet just named Leo Newman as the kid in the suitcase, Scott.

341
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,480
这件事马上就要公开了
This thing's gonna break.

342
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,190
随时可能发生 到那一刻
It could be any minute now, and when it does,

343
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,990
我们没有任何线索这一事实
the fact that we have nothing

344
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,990
就不再是我们的问题 而会成为全球新闻
stops being our problem and becomes global news.

345
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,410
听着 我们在争取引渡吗 
Listen, are we working on extradition?

346
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,530
当然
Of course.

347
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,620
很好
Good.

348
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,160
在你看来 这些人很有希望吗 
These guys look good to you, right?

349
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,790
现在还难说
It's still kind of hard to tell.

350
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,050
到审讯室去 想尽一切办法 让他们交待地更容易些 好吗 
Well, get in that room and do whatever it takes to make telling easier. Okay?

351
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,590
好吧 我会的
Okay. Will do.

352
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,780
我好想你
I've missed this.

353
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,530
是吗 
Did you now?

354
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,160
等等
Wait.

355
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,910
你知道我喜欢什么
You know what I like.

356
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,050
这怎么样 
How's that?

357
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,480
确保绑紧
Make sure it's tight.

358
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,450
就这样
That's it.

359
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,880
你在做什么 
What are you doing?

360
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:41,480
肖恩
Sean. Sean!

361
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,110
（格林威治时间 凌晨2点25分）

362
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,320
绝对不行
Absolutely not.

363
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,820
可是我们没有时间了 里奥也是
Well, we're running out of time here, and so is Leo.

364
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,570
幸会 我叫斯科特安德森
Nice to meet you. Scott Anderson.

365
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,570
谢谢你协助我们 安德森特工
Thank you for assisting us, Agent Anderson.

366
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,160
你的联络工作应该有助于全方位沟通 我们进展如何 
Your liaison should help communication all around. Where are we?

367
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,410
娜塔莉汤普森的财务安排需要进一步调查
Well, Natalie Thompson's financial arrangements need further scrutiny.

368
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,920
塔拉麦卡利斯特对库珀纽曼曾有不满
Tara McAllister had a grudge against Cooper Newman and Aadesh Chopra--

369
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
阿德什乔普拉决定“无可奉告” 这些我都看见了
Has elected to go "no comment." All of which I saw.

370
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,960
我没有看到的是证据
What I'm not seeing is evidence.

371
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,710
我们有足够的证据拘留他们吗 
Do we have enough to hold them?

372
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
现在还不够 先生
Not yet, sir.

373
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,510
对不起 可是四名英国公民
Excuse me, but four British citizens

374
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,510
彼此住得相当近
living in pretty close proximity to each other

375
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,930
在那个酒店住了一晚 第二天乘飞机离开
spent one night at that hotel before flying out the next day.

376
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,770
其中至少有两个人和库珀纽曼有联系
At least two of them have links to Cooper Newman.

377
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:24,270
他在召开会议 一半的客人都和库珀有联系
Who were holding a conference. Half the guests had links to Cooper.

378
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,980
-他们在说谎 -你怎么知道 
-They're lying. -How do you know that?

379
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,060
你能证明吗 
Can you prove it?

380
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,940
多点时间 对他们施加更多压力 我认为能
Given some time, pushing them harder, I think so.

381
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,320
在如何审讯方面我不需要建议
I don't need advice on running an interrogation.

382
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,160
与此同时 肖恩蒂尔森在逃亡路上
Meanwhile, Sean Tilson is leaving a trail of destruction

383
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,280
让我们非常被动
on his way to wherever it is he's heading.

384
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,870
他是关键人物 和面具劫持者
He's the link between the gang in the masks and whoever has Leo.

385
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,950
和控制里奥的人有关 所以在纽约待了更久
That's why he stayed in New York.

386
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,370
我阻止这升级为相关的系列犯罪
The only way I'm stopping this escalating to a linked series crime

387
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,040
和令所有人头疼的局面的唯一办法
and a world of pain for all of us

388
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,790
就是我能保证我们就快抓住蒂尔森了
is my assurance that we're close to apprehending Tilson.

389
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,210
让我旁听 我会给他们施压
Let me sit in. I'll put them under some pressure.

390
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,550
你怎么会认为他们的回答会不一样 
What makes you think their answers will be any different?

391
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
经验
Experience.

392
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,560
让他旁听 不过让凡妮莎提问题
Sit in. But leave the questions to Vanessa.

393
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,810
通力合作 我们需要结果
Work together on this. We need results.

394
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,810
他是谁 
Who's this?

395
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,400
美国联邦调查局特工 斯科特安德森进入了审讯室
FBI Special Agent Scott Anderson enters the interview room.

396
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,030
你还在英国的司法管辖范围
You're still under UK jurisdiction,

397
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:15,070
安德森特工不会提问题
and Agent Anderson will not be asking questions.

398
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,370
为什么选麦迪逊公园酒店 
Why the Park Madison?

399
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,750
我…想让一切都非常特别
I-- I wanted everything to be special.

400
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,330
你还在租房 对吗 
You're still renting, aren't you?

401
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,040
40岁以下的人没人在伦敦买得起房子
Nobody under the age of 40 can afford to buy in London.

402
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,670
但不是所有人住豪华酒店 而同时去借高利贷
But not everybody stays in luxury hotels, yet also uses loan sharks.

403
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,970
如果你知道他 那你一定也知道 那些钱不是我借的
If you know about him, then you must also know it wasn't me who borrowed that money.

404
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,220
娜塔莉 你是从哪里弄来的现金还他 
Where'd you get the cash to pay him, Natalie?

405
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,310
我…
Well, I…

406
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,190
-为了这趟旅行攒了好多年 -攒现金 
-…put it aside for the trip for ages. -In cash?

407
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,230
现金 所以才是美元
In cash. That's why it was in dollars.

408
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,150
一旦开始打算结婚 就连杯酒都很少买
Once you say you're getting married, you hardly buy a drink,

409
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:57,280
莫妮说最好用信用卡购物 所以…
and Mon said it was best to shop on my credit cards, so…

410
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,740
对于一天来说 那可是好多钱
Still, it's a lot of money for one day.

411
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,620
我说过了 我想让一切很特别
Like I said, I wanted it to be special.

412
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,490
你在哪里换的钱 
Where did you change the money?

413
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,380
-我不记得 -你一定有收据吧
-Can't remember. -You must have a receipt.

414
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,800
我会以为做你这种工作的人 总是保留详细的记录
I would have thought someone in your job always kept scrupulous records.

415
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,880
我也会以为做你这种工作的人 只会逮捕罪犯
And I would have thought someone in yours would only arrest criminals.

416
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,640
你本来去不起美国 是不是 
You couldn't afford to go to America, could you?

417
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:31,190
实际上 你的银行记录说明 你几乎连伯明翰都去不起
Actually, your bank records suggest you could barely afford to go to Birmingham.

418
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,440
你告诉你妻子要去那里
Where you told your wife you were.

419
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,570
阿德什 你为什么住在这么贵的酒店 
Why such an expensive hotel, Aadesh?

420
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,650
无可奉告
No comment.

421
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,700
你在干嘛 能不能别那样 
What is that? Can he not do that?

422
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,240
-什么  -就是… 那样
-What? -The… That.

423
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,830
你听到了 对吧 
You heard it right?

424
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,210
我们看了你给库珀纽曼的简历
We've been looking at the CV you gave to Cooper Newman,

425
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,880
你在其中对你的学业成就撒了谎
on which you lie about your academic achievements,

426
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,130
还有你的就业经历 你参与的慈善工作
your employment history, your involvement in charity work

427
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,840
还有你的居住情况
and your living arrangements.

428
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,760
看 他又那么做了 允许他那么做吗 
He did it again. Is he allowed to do that?

429
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,590
你是个骗子 对吗 阿德什 
You're a liar. Aren't you, Aadesh?

430
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,560
我们之前给你看了这个人的照片
This is the man whose photograph we showed you earlier.

431
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,270
两年前国际刑警组织 发出了逮捕他的红色通缉令
Interpol issued a Red Notice for his arrest two years ago.

432
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,020
他是一个很危险的人物
He's a very dangerous individual.

433
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,940
上周一 他用假名字 也入住了麦迪逊公园酒店
He also checked into the Park Madison last Monday, under a pseudonym.

434
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,660
下午5点15分 这是他在酒店大堂
Here he is in the lobby at 17:15.

435
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,330
晚上7点22分 这是他在酒店的酒吧
Here he is in the hotel bar at 19:22.

436
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,000
这是你
And here's you.

437
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,340
紧跟在他后面 进入男厕所
Going into the men's room, right after him.

438
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,840
-只不过你说：“从来没见过他” -我没看见他
-Only you said, "Never seen him before." -I didn't see him.

439
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,920
-拜托 乔普拉先生… -不
-Please, Mr. Chopra-- -No!

440
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,090
什么都不说让我看起来有罪
Saying nothing is making me look guilty.

441
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,510
我没看到他
I didn't see him.

442
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,100
-你跟他说话了吗  -说话 什么 在男厕所 
-Did you talk to him? -Talk to him? What, in the gents?

443
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,810
在男厕所不能说话 尿尿的时候眼睛要看着天花板
You don't talk in the gents. You keep your eyes on the ceiling while you wazz.

444
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:52,350
你只有在甩的时候才向下看 不能左顾右盼
You look down to shake and keep your eyes in your lane.

445
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,690
不是吗 
Innit?

446
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,400
你们完全没说话 
You didn't speak at all?

447
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,150
-没有 -我肯定你是知道的
-No. -As I'm sure you're aware,

448
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,570
公共厕所里面没有闭路电视监控 所以除了你的话 我们没有其他证据
there's no CCTV in public bathrooms, so we only have your word for that.

449
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,950
阿德什 目前来看 你的话好像不可靠
And at this point, Aadesh, that seems less than reliable.

450
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,280
我没有说谎
I'm not lying.

451
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,870
-狗屎 -安德森特工
-Bullshit. -Agent Anderson.

452
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,240
他花了一整天查看场地 然后他们在男厕所交流了
He spent the whole day scoping the place, and then they debriefed in the men's room.

453
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,210
你不是说他不问问题吗 
What happened to him not asking any questions?

454
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,290
那是指控
That was an accusation.

455
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,420
关于那次会面 库珀纽曼说了什么 
What did Cooper Newman say about the meeting?

456
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,170
为什么问这个  你觉得他对我们说了什么 
Why? What do you think they told us?

457
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,510
我只是想知道他们认为会面进行得如何
Just wondered how they thought it went.

458
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,390
现在他们不会给我打电话了 是不是 
Don't suppose they're gonna call me now, are they?

459
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:38,190
没人敢这么对待我 肖恩 你听见了吗 
No one does this to me, Sean! Do you hear me?

460
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,240
我不在乎他会不会知道我们的事
I don't care if he finds out about us.

461
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,370
我不在乎他跟我离婚 离也值了
I don't care if he divorces me. It'll be worth it.

462
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,790
这是该死的绑架
This is bloody kidnap!

463
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,920
会面之后你做了什么 
What did you do after the meeting?

464
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,750
什么都没做 我叫了客房送餐 我睡觉了
Nothing. I got room service. I went to bed.

465
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,050
他第一次到地球上最棒的城市之一
His first trip to one of the greatest cities on Earth,

466
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,510
而他连酒店都没离开
and he doesn't leave the hotel.

467
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:06,090
我跟五个成年人住在 和这间屋子一样大的房子里 朋友
I live with five adults in a house the size of this room.

468
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,180
没有比睡觉更重要的
-Nothing beats sleep.

469
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,800
阿德什 你凌晨2点时在做什么 
-What were you doing at 2:00 a.m.?

470
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,100
什么 没做什么
What? N-Nothing.

471
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:18,190
酒店记录显示你在凌晨1点43分 选择了一部付费电影
Hotel records show you selected an on-demand movie at 1:43 a.m.

472
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,860
《迈阿密辣妹》
Miami Spice.

473
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,110
你知道如果我想溜出去 我会做什么 
You know what I'd do if I was gonna slip out,

474
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:27,160
知道以后得说服别人我在房间里
knowing I'd have to convince people sometime later that I was actually there?

475
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,280
在我离开之前 开始放一部电影
Right before I left, I'd start a movie.

476
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,450
我会想一定有某种我在看电影的记录
I'd figure there'd be some record of me watching.

477
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,950
你不会租一部色情片 对吗 
-You wouldn't hire porn though, would you?

478
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,750
如果我像你一样 我就会
-If I looked like you, that's what I'd do.

479
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,250
你这话是什么意思 
What is that supposed to mean?

480
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,250
你记得《迈阿密辣妹》的情节吗 
Do you remember the plot of Miami Spice?

481
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,710
其实我记得 我想你在里面
Yeah. I think you were in it.

482
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,500
-真好笑… -够了
-Oh, you know, it's funny-- -Okay!

483
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,300
我不是骗子
I am not a liar.

484
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,260
好吗 我不是骗子
All right? I am not a liar.

485
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:54,020
我假装比现实中更成功
I pretended to be more successful than I am

486
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,890
因为我即将跟世界上最大的传播机构开会
because I was meeting the world's top strategic communications agency,

487
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,440
我需要他们把我当回事
and I needed them to take me serious.

488
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,020
所以我才住那个酒店
That's why I stayed at that hotel.

489
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,070
所以你也没提到过你有犯罪记录吗 
Is that why you also didn't mention you have a criminal record?

490
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,780
这怎么不是问题 
How is that not a question?

491
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,450
我以为你不会问问题
I thought you weren't asking questions.

492
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,240
我一直很好奇这个袋子
Well, I just keep wondering about this bag.

493
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,500
什么袋子 
What bag?

494
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,460
你留在水疗中心衣物柜的那个
The one you left in a locker at the spa.

495
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,840
然后在退房的时候他们提醒你 你在前台取回了
Then picked up at reception when they reminded you about it at checkout.

496
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,710
袋子里有什么东西 
What was in it?

497
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,340
显然是洗漱用品
Toiletries. Obviously.

498
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,430
不是现金 
Not cash?

499
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,510
-不是什么  -你没有留下一个袋子
-Not what? -You weren't leaving a bag

500
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,470
里面都是现金 好让其他人取走 
full of cash for someone to pick up later?

501
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,180
你疯了吗 
Are you mad?

502
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,610
你知道我是怎么想的吗 
You know what I think?

503
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,150
我想你是钱
I think you're the money.

504
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,740
这种行动需要三个要素
Operation like this takes three things.

505
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,910
计划、懂技术和一定数额无法追踪的现金
Planning, tech savvy and a certain amount of untraceable cash.

506
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,910
你就是钱的部分
You're the money.

507
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,370
你满嘴狗屎
And you're full of shit.

508
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,920
我当时只是个孩子 那是一次警告
I was a kid. It was a caution.

509
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,260
我以为我一到18岁 记录就取消了
I thought it was spent once I was 18.

510
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,840
你骇入了英格兰和威尔士的考试委员会
You hacked the main examining board for England and Wales

511
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:14,140
把两次即将进行的A级试卷 给了你所有的朋友
and gave two upcoming A-level exam papers to all your mates,

512
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,470
导致试卷完全作废
making them completely unusable.

513
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,310
可是那时我承认了 我现在也承认
But I came clean then, and I'm coming clean now.

514
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,350
你承认是因为你被逮住了
You came clean because you got caught.

515
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,110
阿德什 我们的问题是 上周一晚上 有人在麦迪逊公园酒店
Our problem, Aadesh, is that someone at the Park Madison last Monday night

516
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,190
有技术能力关闭并控制闭路电视监控系统
had the expertise to disable and then override CCTV

517
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,190
在15层 长达11分钟
on the 15th floor for 11 minutes.

518
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,320
他们给劫持录了像 然后在同一时间
They recorded the abduction and then released it simultaneously

519
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,580
从一批看似无法追踪的代理电子邮件帐户 发布了视频
from a batch of seemingly untraceable proxy email accounts.

520
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,200
并不是人人都会这样的技术
Not everybody has the know-how to make that happen.

521
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,910
-可是有很多人会 -是的 包括你
-But plenty do. -Yeah, including you.

522
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,670
对 可我没做
Yeah, but I didn't!

523
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:47,250
我… 我说了谎 因为我需要一个机会
I-- I lied 'cause I need a break.

524
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,090
就…
Just…

525
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,300
我想做父亲
I wanna be a dad.

526
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,560
我想自己创业 养活我的家人
I wanna build a business of my own. Take care of my family.

527
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,100
我只想做到这些
That is all I care about.

528
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,940
够了
Oh, pack it in.

529
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:12,200
（北爱尔兰）

530
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,940
-我们跟史蒂夫谈了 -黛西没事吧 
-We spoke to Steve. -Is Daisy okay?

531
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,280
-她知道发生了什么吗  -他说你们结婚这么多年
-Does she know what's going on? -He says in your years together,

532
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,400
他从来不知道 你会在失眠的夜晚起来去散步
he never once knew you to get up and walk during a sleepless night.

533
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,490
他在说谎
He's lying.

534
