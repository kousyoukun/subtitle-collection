30
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,250
小谢尔顿

31
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,250
第六季 第12集

32
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,960
前情提要
Previously on Young Sheldon...

33
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,210
看完我会和你说的
Well, I will watch this and let you know.

34
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,880
她明摆着在撩你
She was totally hitting on you.

35
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,380
她只是想租电影罢了
All she did was rent a movie.

36
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,720
但她笑得跟朵花儿似的 还摸你的胳膊 
Yeah, and then she laughed and she touched your arm.

37
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,790
- 教科书式撩汉 - 我又不是故意的
- That's textbook flirting. - I wasn't trying to.

38
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,900
我想说的是 没人在束缚你
All I'm saying is you're not tied down.

39
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,600
你十七岁的儿子把我女儿搞怀孕了
I'm getting parenting advice from a woman

40
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,600
你竟然还给我提育儿建议
whose 17-year-old son got my daughter pregnant.

41
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,570
成熟一点 给你女儿打电话 把事情说开
Grow up, call your daughter, and make it right.

42
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,670
现在就打
Now.

43
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,500
- 我得先... - 别废话
- Well, I need... - I said now.

44
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,900
我是要说
I was gonna say

45
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,040
我需要她的电话号码
I need the phone number.

46
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,240
你有笔吗
Do you have a pen?

47
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,040
每种文化都有它独特的传统
Every culture has its own traditions to celebrate

48
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,640
来庆祝人生大事
important life events:

49
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,850
受诫礼
bar mitzvahs,

50
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,200
成人礼
quincea?eras,

51
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,740
宝宝首次漫展
baby's first Comic-Con.

52
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,000
我最爱的就是葬礼和迎婴派对
My favorites are funeral and baby shower.

53
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,140
这是唯二为你举行
They're the only two thrown in your honor

54
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,040
而你却不用出席的活动
you're not expected to attend.

55
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,170
爱了
Love it.

56
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,020
互相送礼之后
Oh, and after we do gifts,

57
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,770
我们可以抱着曼迪的肚子拍照
we could take pictures holding Mandy's belly.

58
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,410
不要
No.

59
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,640
好吧
Okay.

60
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,810
看这个
Here's one.

61
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,380
往奶瓶里装满果汁
We can fill baby bottles with juice

62
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,980
然后看谁最先喝完
and see who can drink it the fastest.

63
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,840
- 别喝我瓶子里面的 - 为什么
- Don't go drinking out of my bottle. - Why?

64
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,310
因为里面不是果汁
'Cause it ain't gonna be juice.

65
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,280
到底什么时候办
When is this thing anyways?

66
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,380
星期天
Sunday.

67
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,310
糟了
Oh, shoot.

68
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,710
我那天约了安泊尔 得放鸽子了
I got a date with Amber. I got to cancel.

69
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,310
没喊你来
You ain't invited.

70
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,810
我是孩子他爹阿
But I'm the dad.

71
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,710
男性止步 《南方公园》说的
No boys allowed. Southern Living says so.

72
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,030
- 安泊尔是谁 - 和我约会的一个女生
- Who is Amber? - A girl I'm seeing.

73
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,330
曼迪知道吗
Does Mandy know?

74
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,350
- 知道什么 - 没事
- Know what? - Oh, nothing.

75
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,180
其实这是她的主意
It was actually her idea.

76
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,910
什么 安泊尔吗 我当然知道
What, Amber? Oh, yeah, I know.

77
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,050
- 她离过婚 - 啥
- She's divorced. - What?

78
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,740
没事 她不老
Don't worry, she ain't old.

79
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,580
只是结婚太早
It's just she got married too young.

80
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,050
好吧
Okay. Uh...

81
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,590
曼迪
So, Mandy,

82
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,950
你有没有想过
have you given any thought

83
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,410
要邀请哪些家人或者朋友来呢
to which friends or family you want to invite?

84
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,250
鉴于这种情况
Well, given the circumstances,

85
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,190
我想把动静弄小点
I'm thinking maybe we keep it small.

86
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,850
是因为他们还不知道这事吗
'Cause your friends don't know about this?

87
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,790
他们不仅不知道这回事 还不认识这男人
They don't know about this. They don't know about that.

88
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,260
他们啥都不知道
They don't know about any of it.

89
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,000
能邀请你妈妈吗
Can I invite your mom?

90
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,830
看来不行
That's a no.

91
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,690
我们真心希望她能来
Well... we would love to have her,

92
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,390
但都看你决定啦
but it's totally up to you.

93
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,790
行吧
Fine.

94
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,690
好极了
Great.

95
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,020
真能好吗
Is it great?

96
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,350
我又想到一个游戏
Oh, I thought of another game we could play.

97
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,000
- 先把巧克力融进尿不湿里 - 重新想
- First, you melt chocolate in a diaper... - Keep thinking.

98
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,620
我们在想游戏玩吗
We're coming up with games to play?

99
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,500
我有个好主意 智能动物科技
Because I have a good one: intelligent animal technology.

100
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,310
举个例子 如果犀牛有智慧
For example, if rhinoceroses were intelligent,

101
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,330
它们怎么打字呢
how would they type?

102
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,920
这是曼迪的迎婴派对
This is for Mandy's baby shower.

103
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,640
那我不想去
Oh. I don't want to go to that.

104
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,960
谢天谢地 仅限女士
Thankfully, it's for ladies only.

105
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,840
是啊 连孩子他爹都不行
Yeah, even if you're the father.

106
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,420
你为什么想去
Why do you want to go?

107
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,770
孩子出生那天我都会去 结果这个派对却不行
Well, I'm gonna be at the birth, but I can't go to the party?

108
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,460
你怎么确定孩子出生那天就让你去了
How do you know she wants you at the birth?

109
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,090
那谁去接住宝宝啊
Who's gonna catch the baby?

110
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,830
你不会想在那儿的
You may not want to be there.

111
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,880
挺艰难的
It's a rough one.

112
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,030
乔治
George.

113
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,120
你说得对 亲爱的
Oh, you're right, dear.

114
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,130
那个动人心弦的场面我永生难忘
It's a beautiful event which I will never forget.

115
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,320
等等 你口口声声说场面十分动人
Wait, you said it was beautiful

116
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,530
但你脸上的表情却是十分冻人
and then made a face to imply that it wasn't.

117
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,690
所以 到底是哪个
So, which is it?

118
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,000
天哪 谢尔顿 生小孩很恶心的
Oh, my God, Sheldon, it's disgusting.

119
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,260
那为啥不直说呢
He could've just said that.

120
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,780
星期天有场很棒的比赛
Pretty good game Sunday,

121
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,060
- 要不你和我一起去看吧 - 好
- if you want to watch with me instead. - All right.

122
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,800
你应该也喊上曼迪的爸爸和弟弟一起去看
You should invite Mandy's dad and brother to join you.

123
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,920
太尴尬了 都还不认识他们
It might be awkward. Don't really know them.

124
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,380
去了你们就认识了
That's how you get to know them.

125
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,730
是啊 是啊
Yeah, yeah.

126
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,680
等等 我不用去看吧
Wait, I don't have to watch football, do I?

127
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,870
- 不用 - 别
- No. - Please don't.

128
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,200
真好
Sweet.

129
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,820
嗨 吉姆
Hi, Jim.

130
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,280
嘿 玛丽 你好啊
Hey, Mary. Good to see you.

131
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,800
要买轮胎吗
You looking for some tires?

132
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,240
其实我是来找你老婆的
Actually, I'm looking for your wife.

133
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,540
你不是又来吼她的吧
You're not gonna yell at her again, are you?

134
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,900
不是不是
No, no.

135
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,120
你确定吗
Okay, you sure about that?

136
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,140
我不介意在旁边吃个瓜
'Cause I wouldn't mind seeing it.

137
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,880
我只是来给她送邀请函
I just wanted to drop off an invitation

138
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,510
请她参加曼迪的迎婴派对
to Mandy's baby shower.

139
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,820
那真是... 太感谢你了
Oh. Well, that's-that's real kind of you.

140
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,300
乔治想邀请你一起
And George is hoping that you'll come over

141
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,050
跟他和小乔去看比赛
and watch the game with him and Georgie.

142
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,170
听起来不错
Huh. Well, that sounds like fun.

143
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,960
也欢迎你儿子一起
And your son is welcome, too.

144
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,500
说实话 康纳对橄榄球和棒球运动
All right, well, you know, Connor ain't all that much

145
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,210
不太感兴趣
into football or baseball.

146
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,560
射击也是 涉及球状物的事情他都不爱
Or, shoot, anything with a ball, really.

147
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,240
你要是来的话
Well, if you do come,

148
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,190
乔治会准备熏牛腩的
I know that George is making brisket.

149
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,140
熏牛腩加橄榄球
Brisket and football?

150
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,360
你可真会开条件
Well, you drive a hard bargain.

151
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,830
你好 玛丽
Hello, Mary.

152
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,190
你好
Hi.

153
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,240
那好 我要去帮...
All right, well, I'm gonna go help, uh...

154
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,830
某个家伙
somebody.

155
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,010
上次 我俩一开始就闹不愉快
I want to apologize for getting off

156
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,100
我为此道歉
on the wrong foot last time.

157
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,240
你说我是个糟糕的母亲那次吗
Oh. You mean when you called me a terrible mother?

158
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,150
但重点是 你跟曼迪又开始联系了
The important thing is you and Mandy are talking again.

159
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,170
我这次来是给你们送
Anyway, I just wanted to drop off

160
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,700
她迎婴派对的邀请函
this invitation to her, uh, baby shower.

161
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,210
谢谢邀请我
Thank you for including me.

162
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,440
当然要
Of course.

163
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,570
欢迎 
是个女宝宝
和我们一起庆祝吧

166
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,820
她怀的是个女孩
You'd think her own mother would know

167
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,310
当妈的居然不知道
she was having a girl.

168
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,530
小乔不想提前知道性别
Well, Georgie wants it to be a surprise,

169
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,860
所以她没告诉几个人
so she's barely told anyone.

170
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,950
她告诉了你
She told you.

171
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,480
没几个人
Barely.

172
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,830
要是你能来帮忙
you know what'd be great

173
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,810
筹备迎婴派对 那就更好了
is if you could come and help us plan it.

174
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,650
我会去的 谢谢你
I'd like that. Thank you very much.

175
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,300
一言为定
Then it's settled.

176
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,650
那... 代我向你丈夫说声再见
All right, please, uh, say goodbye to your husband.

177
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,040
你可以亲自说再见
Well, you can tell him yourself.

178
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,950
他就躲在那堆轮胎后面
He's hiding behind that stack of tires.

179
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,710
再见
Bye.

180
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,720
请进
It's open.

181
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,820
您好
Hello.

182
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,420
请问我可否申请
I was wondering

183
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,850
这周日进实验室
if I could have access to the lab on Sunday.

184
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,260
- 周日我不在这儿 - 您会在哪儿
- I'm not here on Sunday. - Where will you be?

185
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,430
我要是告诉你 你会去找我的
If I tell you that, you might go there.

186
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,710
我跟您说过了 我会在实验室
Well, I told you where I'll be: the lab.

187
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,260
那好吧 钥匙在这 随便用
How about this? Here's the key. Go nuts.

188
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,660
但我仍未成年 需要成年人陪同
But I'm a minor. I require adult supervision.

189
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,840
我不会告诉其他人
I won't tell anyone.

190
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,310
我会 我守不住秘密
I will. I'm quite the tattler.

191
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,910
那你就只能等到周一
Then you'll have to wait till Monday.

192
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,370
但我周日得找理由离开家
But I'm trying to get out of the house on Sunday.

193
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:07,980
为什么 
Why?

194
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,810
被我哥搞大肚子的女人的爸爸和弟弟
The father and the brother of the woman

195
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,940
要来跟我的哥哥和爸爸
my brother impregnated are coming over to watch sports

196
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,440
一起看体育比赛
with my brother and my father.

197
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,710
你是想正设法逃离一场男人间培养感情的聚会
So you're trying to avoid a male bonding experience?

198
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,840
不惜任何代价
At all cost.

199
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,600
孩子 你要知道 作为科研人员
You know, son, as scientists,

200
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,370
我们时常需要与陌生人一起合作
we're often teamed with people that we don't know.

201
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,440
培养关系 建立友谊的能力
The ability to bond and build relationships,

202
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,640
你必须得学会
that's... that's an essential skill.

203
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,530
您的建议是 让我将这次聚会
So you're suggesting I use this gathering

204
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,120
视作一次练习的机会吗
as an opportunity to better those skills?

205
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,850
正是
Exactly.

206
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,330
好的 我会尝试
Very well. I'll give it a go.

207
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,500
- 棒极了 - 您要来参加吗
- Great. - Would you like to join us?

208
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,970
- 不了 - 为什么 您要去哪儿
- I can't. - Why? Where will you be?

209
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,330
各位 我们可以来点简单而浪漫的
So, I was thinking we could do something sweet and simple,

210
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,160
比如搞个花园派对
like a garden party.

211
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,600
听起来不错
Oh, that sounds good.

212
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,760
我知道曼迪不喜欢兴师动众
I know Mandy doesn't like to make a big fuss.

213
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,770
啥时候的事
Since when?

214
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,900
那孩子总是想成为人们关注的焦点
That girl has always wanted to be the center of attention.

215
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,670
好吧 你肯定是最了解她的
Oh, well, I guess you would know.

216
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,310
花园派对听起来还行
And garden party sounds lovely,

217
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,690
但我们可以加点有趣的元素
but maybe we could do something a little more fun.

218
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,070
比如"公主"
Like princess

219
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,460
或是"游历世界" 就是那些
or "Around the world"... You know, all the places

220
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,840
她想去但是去不了的地方
she was gonna go, but now she can't

221
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,940
因为她毁掉了自己的人生
'cause she ruined her life.

222
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,590
我喜欢公主
I like princess.

223
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,590
太好了 我知道一家超棒的蛋糕店
Oh, great. I know this wonderful bakery

224
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,050
可以做出漂亮的童话城堡蛋糕
that makes a cake that looks just like a fairy-tale castle.

225
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,690
我打算自己做德式巧克力蛋糕
I was gonna make my German chocolate cake.

226
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,290
她是要生个女孩 而不是去发起二战
She's having a girl, not starting World War II.

227
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,880
那就城堡蛋糕
Castle cake it is.

228
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,350
你好
Hello.

229
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,620
适合书呆子的电影在那边
Ugh, nerd movies are over there.

230
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,350
不 我要跟曼迪的爸爸和弟弟建立感情
No, I need to bond with Mandy's father and brother,

231
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,310
我是来找些他们会看的电影
so I'm looking for movies they might've seen,

232
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,070
以便营造睾酮爆表的聊天氛围
so that we can engage in some testosterone-rich banter.

233
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,930
我可以帮你找找
Okay, I can help you.

234
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,370
很多男人会借这盘碟
A lot of dudes have been renting this.

235
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,810
{\an8}《灵犬宾果》

236
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,810
"宾果
"Bingo.

237
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,040
他是每个家庭最好的朋友"
He's every family's best friend."

238
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,270
你在捉弄我吗
Are you tricking me?

239
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,280
没有
No.

240
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,650
幸亏问了一嘴 帮我结账吧
Glad I asked. Ring me up.

241
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,510
今天很开心 谢谢
That was fun. Thanks.

242
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,360
今天很开心 谢谢
That was fun. Thanks.

243
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,600
周日我们继续约会吗
Are we still on for Sunday?

244
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,400
对不起 周日不行 那天是曼迪的迎婴派对
Sorry, can't. Mandy's having a baby shower.

245
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,990
你要去参加吗
You're going to that?

246
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,220
不去 但我答应要去陪她的爸爸和弟弟 
No, but I promised I'd hang out with her dad and brother,

247
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,120
所以...
so...

248
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,140
跟你聊这个是不是很奇怪
Is it weird to talk about this stuff?

249
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,020
我要是跟你聊我的前夫 你会觉得奇怪吗
Would it be weird if I talked about my ex-husband?

250
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,580
看情况 你会说些什么
Depends. What would you say?

251
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,720
不知道
I don't know.

252
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,610
聊些关于 他一米九三 接近两百二十斤
Maybe that he's six-four, weighs about 240 pounds,

253
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,880
脾气暴躁
got a short fuse.

254
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,650
好吧 我不想听
Yeah, I don't want to hear that.

255
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,150
聊聊你的事吧 我不在意
Well, I'm fine if you want to talk about your situation.

256
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,480
真好 我想要些建议
Oh, great, 'cause I need some advice.

257
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,280
我应该给曼迪准备礼物吗
So, should I get Mandy a present?

258
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,230
你是指给婴儿的礼物吗
You mean, like a baby gift?

259
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,720
或是给孩子妈准备的 
Or for her. You know,

260
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,810
就是那种"感谢你的辛苦付出"
like, "Thanks for making the effort"?

261
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,980
最好别刻在礼物上
I don't think I would engrave that on anything,

262
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,510
不过这样很贴心
but... could be sweet.

263
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,580
挺好
Cool.

264
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,010
你说你前任那么大块头 应该是在开玩笑吧
You were just playing about your ex being that big, right?

265
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,540
但离婚是你们俩都情愿的吧 他也想离
But the divorce was a mutual thing? He wanted it, too?

266
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,040
他应该不在家吧
He ain't in there, is he?

267
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,230
嘿
Hey.

268
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,940
我讨厌那个女的
I hate that woman.

269
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,140
你妈妈吗 她迟早要死的
Your mother? Eh, she ain't gonna live forever.

270
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,640
是曼迪的妈妈
Mandy's mom.

271
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,140
她一时半会儿还死不了
Oh. Yeah, that one we're stuck with for a while.

272
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,590
我好心好意地发出邀请
I extended an olive branch

273
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,450
只是让她参与一下迎婴派对
to make her feel part of the baby shower,

274
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,560
她就想完全接管这一切
and then she just took over the whole dang thing.

275
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,730
那怎么办 我开车撞死她得了
All right, I'll run her over with my truck.

276
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,500
我没心情跟你开玩笑
I'm not ready to laugh yet, George.

277
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,070
等你心情好了
When you are ready to laugh,

278
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,530
可以看看我这部电影
I have got the movie for you.

279
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,130
《灵犬宾果》 适合男人看的
Bingo. It's for men,

280
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,600
但我想你也会喜欢
but I think you'll get it.

281
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,950
有人吗
Anybody home?

282
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,390
嘿
Hey.

283
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,840
怎么全是粉色的啊
What's with all the pink?

284
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,780
这是因为...
Uh, it's 'cause...

285
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,060
女孩儿办派对就是喜欢粉色啊
it's my party, and I'm a girl.

286
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,390
有道理
Makes sense.

287
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,390
那么 你来这里干什么啊
So, uh, what are you doing here?

288
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,260
你知道你没被邀请吧
You know you're not invited to the shower, right?

289
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,390
我知道 只是每个人都为此准备了礼物
I know. It's just, everybody's bringing presents

290
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,760
所以我也想给你一份
for the baby today, so I wanted to bring one for you.

291
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,990
小乔 谢谢
Georgie, thank you.

292
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,250
打开看看
Open it.

293
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,790
好啊
Okay.

294
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,720
抱歉用的是圣诞节的包装 我只剩这个了
Sorry for the Christmas paper. That's all we had.

295
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,580
好漂亮啊
It's beautiful.

296
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,790
看看里面
Look inside.

297
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,580
这又是啥
What am I looking at here?

298
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,220
是我们女儿的超声波图
It's the sonogram of our little girl.

299
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,980
我不是傻瓜
I'm not an idiot.

300
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,810
这是我见过最贴心的事了
That is the sweetest thing I've ever seen.

301
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,430
我 我..很开心
I-I... I love it.

302
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,510
那就好 其实这是安泊尔的主意
Good. It was actually Amber's idea.

303
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,840
她想得真是周到 谢谢你
Well, that's very thoughtful. Thank you.

304
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,140
替我也谢谢她
And thank her.

305
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,810
我会的
I will.

306
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,440
好了 我不打扰你们了
All right, well, I'll let you get back

307
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,840
- 尽情享受吧 - 好的
- to your party. - Okay.

308
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,640
还有 你今天很美
You look great, by the way.

309
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,240
嘿 吉姆
Hey, Jim.

310
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,100
又见面了 快进来
Good to see you again. Hey, come on in.

311

312
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,110
- 嘿 康纳 你好啊 - 你好
- Hey, Connor. Good to see you. - Hey.

313
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,220
又见面了 麦卡利斯特先生
Good to see you again, Mr. McAllister.

314
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,980
我是小乔
Georgie.

315
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,610
你袖子上还有颜料呢
Oh, you got some paint on you.

316
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,990
给家里刷墙了吗
Been doing some work around the house?

317
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,660
没有
No.

318
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,290
我是个画家
I'm a painter.

319
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,490
他总是呆在他自己房间里
Yeah, yeah, he's always in his room

320
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,500
画这画那 一喊他给车库刷漆就不好使了
painting stuff, until you ask him to paint the garage.

321
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,610
你好幽默哦
You're hilarious.

322
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,860
开个玩笑
All right, sorry. Uh...

323
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,610
- 他是个艺术家 - 酷哦
- He's an artist. - Cool.

324
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,020
就像是 那种...在电视里面画云朵的人吗
Like, the, uh... the guy on TV that paints the clouds.

325
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,760
我画的东西更...抽象些
Uh, my stuff is a little more, uh, abstract.

326
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,960
我懂的
Oh, sure.

327
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,560
就是说画的啥也不是呗
That means it doesn't look like stuff.

328
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,770
艺术家肯定饿了吧
I hope you're a starving artist

329
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,820
我弄了些牛腩
'cause I got a brisket

330
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,750
就在外面的熏炉里 特地为你做的
on the smoker out there with your name on it.

331
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,090
康纳 他还是...
Connor, uh, is also, uh,

332
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,230
一位素食主义者
a-a vegetarian.

333
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,660
没事没事
No problem.

334
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,540
我们还有豆子 多好的蔬菜啊
We got beans. That's a vegetable. Right?

335
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,460
来吧
Come on.

336
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,710
这蛋糕也太棒了
This cake is amazing.

337
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,080
看上去还行吧
To look at, sure.

338
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,810
我觉得味道更重要
I prefer cakes for eating.

339
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:32,980
你阴阳怪气什么呢
What's your problem?

340
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,320
你问来问去干什么
What's your problem?

341
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,920
那么奥黛丽 这是你的第一个外孙女吗
So, Audrey, is this your first grandkid?

342
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,090
是的
Yep.

343
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,560
你肯定很激动
You must be excited.

344
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,200
当然
Sure.

345
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,060
这种未婚先孕的行为虽然不太好 毕竟...
Can't say I'm thrilled with the circumstances, but...

346
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,630
阿曼达一直我行我素
Amanda's always done things her way.

347
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,640
我有很多孙子孙女
I have a lot of grandkids.

348
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,950
到那时候 你或许就不在乎
At some point, you just stop caring how they got here.

349
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,950
他们是怎么搞出来的了
how they got here.

350
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,690
- 我去喝点潘趣酒 - 都是无酒精的
- I'm gonna get some punch. - It's nonalcoholic.

351
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,730
你下来吗
You coming down?

352
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,060
一会儿就去
In a sec.

353
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,930
其实也没啥意思 下面可尴尬了
You're not missing much. It's real awkward down there.

354
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,240
出什么事了吗
Something wrong?

355
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,510
没有
No.

356
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,150
是因为你妈妈吗
Is it your mom?

357
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,020
反正我妈的脑子肯定是有点事
'Cause something's definitely wrong with mine.

358
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,490
不 她还好
No, she's fine.

359
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,390
虽然她很难搞 但不是因为她
Well, she's a nightmare, but, uh, that's not it.

360
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,630
好看啊
Pretty.

361
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,400
小乔给我的
Yeah, Georgie got it for me.

362
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,040
里面装着我们宝宝的超声影像
There's a sonogram of our baby inside.

363
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,910
他干得不错
Good for Georgie.

364
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,810
是啊
Yeah.

365
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,020
对小乔来说是不错
Good for Georgie.

366
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,310
我跟你讲
I got to tell you,

367
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,980
牛仔队今年将一往无前
I think the Cowboys are gonna take it all the way this year.

368
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,490
我对橄榄球没什么兴趣
Not really into football.

369
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,700
真的吗
Seriously?

370
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,640
那行吧 车呢 你喜欢吗
That's cool. You like cars?

371
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,540
也不太喜欢
Not really.

372
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,690
音乐呢
Music?

373
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,180
这个可以
Yeah.

374
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,650
很好 你喜欢哪个歌手
Great. Who do you like?

375
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,680
史密斯乐团
The Smiths.

376
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,320
史密斯是谁啊
I don't know them.

377
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,420
枪炮与玫瑰呢
Guns N' Roses?

378
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,390
倒戈向商业的摇滚乐叛徒
Corporate rock sellouts.

379
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,860
行吧 但这帮叛徒的歌疟了
Yeah, well, sellouts who kick ass, so...

380
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,470
你好
Hello.

381
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,200
谢尔顿 这是曼迪的弟弟 康纳
Sheldon, this is Mandy's brother, Connor.

382
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,150
你们在看比赛吗 
Are you watching the game?

383
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,810
因为我听说牛仔队今年势头猛烈
Because I heard the Cowboys are

384
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,410
会冲进决赛
going to go all the way this year.

385
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,480
没事 他也不看橄榄球
It's okay. He don't watch football either.

386
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,140
好极了 
Great.

387
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,120
我白研究特洛伊・阿克曼了
I learned who Troy Aikman is for nothing.

388
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,120
{\an8}美国橄榄球联盟 明星四分卫

389
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,090
康纳看着是个好孩子
So, Connor seems like a good kid.

390
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,400
对 没错 他是个挺好的孩子
Oh, yeah, yeah, he's a good kid.

391
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,830
跟地球人格格不入
From another planet.

392
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,970
我也有一个这种怪孩子
Oh, I got one of those.

393
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,200
小乔的弟弟
Georgie's little brother.

394
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:36,020
他也是个二十二岁 永远也找不着一份正经工作
Is he a 22-year-old art school graduate with no prospects of

395
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,280
前途黯淡的艺术系毕业生吗
 ever holding down a real job?

396
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,780
其实 他是个科研天才
Actually, he's a science genius

397
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,720
十一岁就上大学了

398
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,190
我们还是聊牛腩吧
Let's just talk about the brisket.

399
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,890
好的 米西 你第一个猜
All right, Missy, you're first.

400
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,930
你觉得这个宝宝会有多重呢
How much do you think the baby's gonna weigh?

401
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,130
让我想想
Uh, I'm gonna say...

402
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:54,890
十六斤多吧
18 pounds.

403
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,810
这不得疼死
Ooh, ouch.

404
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,740
- 太重了吗 - 太重了
- Too much? - Too much.

405
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,210
不过也对 小乔就是个大号宝宝
But then again, Georgie was a big'un.

406
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,180
有多大
How big?

407
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,620
得快九斤了
Almost ten pounds.

408
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,790
九斤
Ten pounds?

409
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,280
最后几个月里 她走起路来就像个牛仔
She walked like a cowboy for months.

410
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,180
我的两个孩子都是正常重量
Both my children were normal weight.

411
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,590
是嘛 真不错
Well, good job.

412
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,130
轮到我了
My turn.

413
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,430
好呢 肚脐周围柔软 还有些回弹空间
Mm-kay, the belly button's still got a little give.

414
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,240
所以 我估摸会是
So, I'm gonna say...

415
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,520
五斤六两的小家伙 轻快容易
a quick and easy six pounds, two ounces

416
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,720
顺畅无阻地呱呱落地
gonna slide right out of there.

417
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,100
我爱你
I love you.

418
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,500
康纳 你姐姐小时候是什么样子
So, Connor, what was your sister like as a kid?

419
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,170
我们不太合拍
Um... we really didn't get along.

420
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,710
对 她比我大
Yeah, she was older

421
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,480
很喜欢捉弄我
and loved picking on me.

422
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,110
小乔对我也这样
The same thing with me and Georgie.

423
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,720
有次 她把我的牙膏掉包成了一整管痔疮膏
Once, she replaced my toothpaste with a tube of hemorrhoid cream.

424
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,320
记不记得那时候 你在看《星际迷航》
Remember when I used to sit on your head

425
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,830
我会坐到你脑袋上
when you'd watch Star Trek?

426
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,970
记得
I do.

427
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,920
猜猜看 他们发射相位炮时我干了什么事
Guess what I did when they'd fire their phasers.

428
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,300
你不必讲出来
You don't need to say it.

429
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,240
我朝他放屁
I farted.

430
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,210
太好笑了
Hilarious.

431
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,270
好的
Okay.

432
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,610
哺乳文胸
Oh, a nursing bra.

00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,020
"带有可拆除胸垫 以防止渗漏"
"Includes removable pads to prevent leakage."

434
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,070
谢谢 这很… 贴心
Thanks. That's... really thoughtful.

435
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,610
我流起来跟水龙头似的
Mine dripped like a faucet.

436
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,810
- 等等 我有个问题 - 你稍后再问
- Wait, I have a question. - Please ask it later.

437
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,070
很好 下个礼物
All right, next present.

438
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,140
好啊
Okay.

439
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,510
这是我送的
That one's from me.

440
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,320
-  什么渗漏 胸吗 - 等会儿
- What leaks? The boob? - Later.

441
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,290
这是什么
What's this?

442
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,690
我们把客房改装成了育儿室
We set up a nursery in the guest room.

443
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,430
你可以搬回来了
You can move back in.

444
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,770
我们现在能别说这个吗
Can we not talk about this now?

445
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,840
有什么问题啊 你接下来会需要帮助
What's the problem? You're gonna need help.

446
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,580
你觉得这段时间以来是谁在帮助她
Who do you think's been helping her this whole time?

447
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,330
而我很感激 但你们不是她的家人
And I appreciate it, but you're not her family.

448
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,980
我们是这个宝宝的家人
We're that baby's family.

449
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,850
小乔就住在街对面
Georgie's right across the street.

450
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,530
对 我想一个青春期小男孩肯定能帮上不少忙
Oh, yes, I'm sure a teenage boy is gonna be a lot of help.

451
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,720
你说这些话太无知了
You don't know what you're talking about.

452
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,770
小乔一直都在身边陪着我
Georgie has been there for me the whole time,

453
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,250
而你最后一刻才过来
and you come in at the last minute

454
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,270
带着从商店买的城堡蛋糕
with a store-bought castle cake,

455
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,750
你觉得这就能弥补一切了吗
and-and you think that's gonna make up for everything?

456
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,090
好吧 我看得出来你情绪有些波动
Okay, I can see you're a little emotional.

457
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,890
是 我现在情绪很动荡
Yeah, I am a little emotional right now,

458
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,760
你在这里也没起到安抚效果
and you being here isn't helping.

459
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,370
你没资格去批评小乔
You do not get to bad-mouth Georgie.

460
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,000
他会成为一个你永远赶不上的好父母
He's gonna be a better parent than you ever were.

461
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,770
老天
Damn.

462
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,610
有人能帮把手吗 现在我要气冲冲地离场
Now, if someone would help me up, I would like to storm out.

463
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,850
多谢
Thank you.

464
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,790
谁想吃蛋糕
So, who wants cake?

465
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,530
宾果 这是张传票
Bingo, it's a subpoena.

466
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,130
一只小狗怎么看得懂传票呢
How's a dog supposed to read a subpoena?

467
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,270
这些描绘简直是纤毫毕现
Look how gritty this is.

468
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,760
弗兰克・米勒真的把一种全然崭新的美学
Frank Miller really brought a whole new aesthetic

469
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,170
赋予了漫画书
to comic books.

470
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,380
我还从没这么思考过
Hmm. I've never really thought of it that way.

471
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,610
我做到了 我们产生了情感交流
I was doing it. I was bonding.

472
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,420
好了 能否请你把它放回我的包里
Now, would you please put it back in the bag?

473
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,540
当然
Oh. Sure.

474
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,210
我表现得很出色
And I was great at it.

475
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,430
十四小时的爱意熏烤
14 hours of smoke and love.

476
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,830
别让我流口水
Trying not to drool.

477
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,840
吉姆 康纳 走了
Jim, Connor, we're leaving!

478
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,060
- 好的亲爱的 但牛腩… - 现在
- All right, hon, but the brisket... - Now!

479
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,510
我给你打包一份
I'll make you a doggy bag.

480
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,520
吉姆
Jim.

481
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,120
可怜的家伙
Poor bastard.

482
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,000
嘿
Hey.

483
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,580
我不知道你来了
I didn't know you were here.

484
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,960
就是来看看这堆战利品
Just checking out the loot.

485
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,880
这太神奇了 为什么不把胸罩都设计成这样
This is amazing. Why don't all bras do this?

486
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,260
脱下来
Take that off.

487
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,380
这就是它的好处 不用脱卸
Well, that's what's great: you don't have to.

488
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,490
看这个
Look at this.

489
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,010
我孩子的父亲
The father of my child.

490
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,620
乳头霜
Ooh, nipple cream.

491
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,740
或许我应该来这个派对的
Maybe I should've went to this party.

492
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,100
感觉很好玩
Sounds fun.
