30
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,680
小谢尔顿

31
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,680
第六季 第15集

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,990
《小谢尔顿》前情提要
Previously on Young Sheldon...

33
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,140
我才没让你心脏病发作
I did not give you a heart attack.

34
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,620
但你让我小鹿乱撞了
You gave me something.

35
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:06,810
这个嘛
Well...

36
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,440
我丈夫是你的秘密情人吗
Is my husband your mystery man?

37
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,670
不敢相信
Can't believe this.

38
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,320
- 你要去哪儿 - 回家
- Where you going? - Home.

39
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,650
他们很明显忘了我们了
They clearly forgot about us.

40
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,400
糟透了
This sucks.

41
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,840
他在这干吗
What is he doing here?

42
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,250
他是个牧师
He's a pastor,

43
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,420
他想来看看
and he wanted to be here.

44
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,460
我是说 他为什么和你在一起
I mean, what is he doing here with you?

45
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,160
我今晚去我妈家住
I'm gonna stay at my mom's house tonight.

46
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,330
我无所谓
Fine by me.

47
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,500
米西在哪儿
Where's Missy?

48
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,350
米西
Missy.

49
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,660
小心点 外放音乐是青少年焦虑的表现
Careful, loud music is a sign of teen angst.

50
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,850
我知道
I'm aware.

51
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,770
米西宝贝 我很抱歉
Missy honey, I'm so sorry.

52
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,810
你还好吗
You okay?

53
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,400
好了 让我进去
Come on, let me in.

54
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,710
你把我忘了
You forgot me.

55
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,960
曼迪要生孩子
Mandy went into labor.

56
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,280
我必须要去医院
I had to go to the hospital.

57
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,240
她生孩子 没人告诉我吗
She had the baby, and no one told me?

58
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,540
看到了吧 青少年焦虑
See? Angst.

59
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,630
回你房间
Go in your room.

60
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,980
宝宝非常可爱
The baby's cute as a button.

61
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,420
已经等不及见她的米西姑姑了
Can't wait to meet her Aunt Missy.

62
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,550
我在学校等了一个小时 最后只能自己走回家
I waited at school for an hour and had to walk home.

63
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,900
甚至没人和我打电话
No one even called.

64
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,730
发生了太多事
There was a lot going on.

65
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,030
重要的是
The important thing is,

66
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,110
你很安全
you're safe,

67
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,990
宝宝也很安全 所有事都很好
baby's safe, everything turned out okay.

68
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,800
不是所有事 我的数据库失败了
Not everything. My database failed.

69
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,390
走开
Go.

70
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,710
妈妈呢
Where's Mom?

71
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,390
她今晚去姥姥那里
She's staying at your meemaw's tonight.

72
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,690
为什么
Why?

73
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,790
帮忙照顾宝宝
Help with the baby.

74
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,400
所以宝宝在家吗 我能见她吗
So, the baby's home? I can meet her?

75
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,010
她明天会回来
She'll be home tomorrow.

76
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,780
那为什么妈妈今晚在那里
Then why's Mom there tonight?

77
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,970
- 听着 米西 我今天很累 - 我也是
- Look, Missy, I've had a long day. - So have I.

78
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,490
- 我也是 - 谢尔顿
- That makes three of us. - Sheldon.

79
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,240
我就在房间里 和你要求的一样
I'm in my room, as directed.

80
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,950
- 她怎么样了 - 她很好
- How's she doing? - She's fine.

81
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,100
她很安静
She's quiet.

82
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,360
她在呼吸吗
She's breathing, right?

83
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,590
是的 稍等
Yes. Hold on.

84
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,280
是的
Yes.

85
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,880
你可以慢一点吗
Mind slowing down?

86
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,720
我已经开到十五码了
I'm going 15.

87
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,630
我说了慢一点
And I said slow down.

88
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,840
好的
You got it.

89
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,430
- 检查宝宝 - 还在呼吸
- Baby check. - Still breathing.

90
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,200
好 我们能行的
All right, we got this.

91
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,380
在离开医院之前
You remembered to check the baby's I.D. Bracelet

92
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,990
你检查宝宝的身份手环了吗
before we left the hospital, right?

93
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,580
怎么了 
Why?

94
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,250
只是确定他们给我们的孩子是对的
To make sure they gave us the right baby.

95
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,390
别胡说了 我能认出来我的孩子
Don't be ridiculous, I know my baby.

96
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,430
这就是她
This is her.

97
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,390
是的 这就是她
Yeah, this is her.

98
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,000
那就好 
Good.

99
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,790
我在电视节目里看到有人抱错孩子
I saw this Maury Povich show where there was a mix-up,

100
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,660
有一家人带回了一个熊孩子
and one family got a real clunker.

101
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,960
就算她是熊孩子 她也是我们的熊孩子
Well, if she's a clunker, she's our clunker.

102
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,570
真好
Great.

103
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,490
早上好
Morning.

104
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,550
早
Hello.

105
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,380
你起得真早
You're up early.

106
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,550
以防我要自己走去学校 所以多留一点时间
Gave myself extra time in case I had to walk again.

107
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,170
我会送你去学校
I'm taking you to school.

108
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,160
顺便说一下 很多孩子走路
Lots of kids walk, by the way.

109
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,420
像是比利
Like Billy?

110
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,740
他妈妈昨天也没来
His mom didn't show up either.

111
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,640
很难过 但是我现在已经可以一笑了之
It was sad, but I can laugh about it now.

112
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,810
够了
Enough.

113
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,990
所以 妈妈今晚回来吗
So, is Mom coming home tonight?

114
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,260
我不知道
I don't know.

115
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,260
你们两个到底发生了什么
What's really going on with you two?

116
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,690
比利说你和布兰达
'Cause Billy said you and Brenda...

117
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,900
停下
Drop it.

118
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,040
好吧
Fine.

119
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,440
既然妈妈不在家 我给你做了午饭
Well, since Mom's not here, I made your lunch.

120
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,470
你真贴心
That was nice.

121
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,530
"今天不要忘了你的女儿
"Try not forgetting your daughter today.

122
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,230
亲亲抱抱 米西"
XO, Missy".

123
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,190
那是我的名字 以防你忘了
That's my name, in case you forgot.

124
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,500
第二天 当我在学校穿梭的时候
The next day, as I walked across campus,

125
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,570
我可以感受到别人的目光都落在我身上
I could feel all eyes were on me,

126
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,640
对我的失败指指点点
judging me for my failure.

127
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,510
看着他们嘲笑我
Look at them laughing at me.

128
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,030
{\an8}指一夜情事后穿着当天的衣服走回家

129
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,030
那是我最接近蒙羞之旅的一次
It was the closest I ever came to a walk of shame.

130
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,560
早上好 谢尔顿
Well, good morning, Sheldon.

131
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,210
有什么好的
What's good about it?

132
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,560
我就是个笑柄
I'm a laughingstock.

133
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,730
我不觉得有人在乎
I don't think anybody cares.

134
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,170
但是我的数据库失败了
But my database failed.

135
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,480
只有你放弃了才是失败
Failure only means something if you quit.

136
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,610
好吧 那我放弃了
Well, get ready for some meaning. I quit.

137
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,770
等等
Hang on.

138
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,440
你听过弗莱德・阿斯特尔的歌吗
Are you familiar with the Fred Astaire song

139
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,880
《振作起来》
"Pick Yourself Up"?

140
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,110
没有
No.

141
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,140
来自音乐剧《摇摆乐时代》
From the beloved musical Swing Time?

142
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,410
也没有
Still no.

143
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,280
那就做好准备被鼓励吧
Then prepare to be uplifted.

144
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,670
"我发现 一切皆有可能 
Nothing's impossible, I have found

145
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,720
当我跌落谷底 我重新振作起来
For when my chin is on the ground I pick myself up

146
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,550
拍去尘土 重新开始"
Dust myself off Start all over again

147
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,310
并没有被鼓励到
I'm not uplifted.

148
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,640
那再听听第二节
Well, then buckle up for the second verse.

149
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,440
"即使失败 也不要失去信心
Don't lose your confidence if you slip

150
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,570
人生起落皆是风景 重新振作起来
 Be grateful for a pleasant trip And pick yourself up

151
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,990
拍去尘土 重新开始"
Dust yourself off Start all over again.

152
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
也许是胀气呢 你给她拍嗝了吗
Maybe it's gas. Did you burp her?

153
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,310
那你觉得我拍她后背的时候
What do you think I was doing

154
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,630
是在干什么
when I was patting her on the back?

155
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,880
你用力拍了吗
Did you pat firmly?

156
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,360
书里面说要"用力拍"
The book says "Pat firmly".

157
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,870
用力了 小乔
It was firm, Georgie.

158
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,710
或许我该给你拍嗝
Maybe you need to be burped.

159
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,090
你这么在行 要不你来
Okay, you're such an expert, why don't you try?

160
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,620
好啊 毕竟我比你更接近婴儿的年纪
All right. I was a baby more recently than you were.

161
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,670
好了 丝丝
It's okay, CeeCee,

162
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,810
爸爸在呢
Daddy's here.

163
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,160
做得好哦
Good job.

164
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,810
我昨天才认识她 别着急嘛
Well, I just met her yesterday, give me a minute.

165
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,730
- 这场景真是历历在目啊 - 我也是
- I remember those days. - Me, too.

166
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,280
你可是个爱哭鬼
Boy, were you a crier.

167
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,640
对不起
Sorry.

168
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,390
太不走心了 也说太晚了
Too little, too late.

169
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,390
我该去帮他们吧
Should I help 'em out?

170
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,560
我来吧
I got it.

171
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,350
拜托 丝丝 配合我一下
Come on, CeeCee, work with me.

172
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,870
爸爸在哄你哦
This is your father speaking.

173
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,520
她安静下来了吗
Did she quiet down?

174
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,120
听起来一点也不安静哦
'Cause she doesn't sound quiet.

175
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,600
让开吧
Step aside.

176
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,180
让我来示范一下该怎么做
Let me show you how it's done.

177
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,530
- 谢谢 - 来吧 好了 
- Please. - Come here. Okay. Yeah.

178
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,700
太姥姥在呢 没事了
Meemaw's here now, all right.

179
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,020
这孩子有问题
Shh. Something's wrong with this one.

180
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,150
让奶奶来试试吧
Can her grandma have a turn?

181
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,720
来 给你 
Here, take her.

182
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,720
毕竟遗传了你的爱哭
She takes after you.

183
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,050
好了 小可爱 奶奶在呢
It's okay, sweetie, Nana's here.

184
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,750
奶奶 谁选的称呼
Nana? Who picked that?

185
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,250
我
I did.

186
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,550
为什么不也叫你姥姥
Why ain't you another meemaw?

187
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,600
因为只有我这一个姥姥
'Cause I'm the only meemaw.

188
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,910
你让她安静下来了 怎么做到的
Oh, you got her to quiet down. How'd you do that?

189
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,470
奶奶魔法
Nana magic.

190
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,220
好吧
Okay, well,

191
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,090
我要去睡觉了
I'm gonna get some sleep,

192
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,720
说不定就不回来了
and I may never come back.

193
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,490
我不了解 代码写得很完美
I don't understand. The code is perfect.

194
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,040
应该能成功运行啊
It should have worked.

195
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,960
问题不在于能不能成功运行
Well, the problem isn't that it didn't work,

196
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,630
而在于没人想用它
the problem is that nobody wanted to use it.

197
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,650
所以 你的意思是我们没有失败 
So, you're saying we didn't fail,

198
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,720
是大众辜负了我们
the public failed us.

199
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,500
不 我们失败了
No, we failed.

200
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,940
鼓励我这件事 你也失败了 干得漂亮
And you've also failed at cheering me up, so good job.

201
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,020
我有个想法
Here's a thought.

202
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,070
我不经意间想出来了
I've been toying around

203
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,680
这个等离子体约束的新想法
with this new plasma confinement idea.

204
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,600
我们要不去研究那个
Why don't we work on that

205
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,080
在数据库上先缓一缓
and, uh, take your mind off the database?

206
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,640
万一那个也失败了呢
What if we fail at that, too?

207
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,600
那我们就接连失败两次了
Then we'll have two failures back to back.

208
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,690
我就只能离开这个国家 或者留胡子
I'll have to leave the country or grow a mustache,

209
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,610
或者等我留好胡子再离开这个国家
or leave the country until I can grow a mustache.

210
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,480
试试才知道会不会失败啊
Well, we don't know if we'll fail until we try.

211
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,920
反对 不试 就不会失败
Counterpoint: if we don't try, we'll never fail.

212
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,050
我的小伙计
Oh, my little pal,

213
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,440
我还要再唱一遍吗
do I have to sing again?

214
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,750
小伙计 我都比你高了
Little? I'm towering over you.

215
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,840
"你记得那些名人吗
Will you remember the famous men

216
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,470
他们失败后又重振旗鼓
Who had to fall to rise again

217
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,720
振作起来 拍去尘土”
So, pick yourself up, dust yourself..."

218
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,450
她太可爱了
She's so cute.

219
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,310
对啊
Yeah.

220
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,090
她哭了多久了
How long has she been crying?

221
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,480
一生
Her whole life.

222
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,210
我有个哥哥也这样
I got a brother like that.

223
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,870
- 你想抱她吗 - 不用了
- You want to hold her? - No.

224
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,450
- 害怕吗 - 有点
- Scared? - Yeah.

225
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,760
明智之举
Smart. Okay, shh...

226
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,630
很抱歉她出生的时候我没在那儿
Sorry I wasn't there when she was born.

227
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,670
你不在吗
Oh, you weren't?

228
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,740
对啊 他们把我忘在学校了
No, they forgot me at school.

229
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,940
我还得走回家
I had to walk home.

230
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,590
哎哟
Oops.

231
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,340
然后我爸还生我的气 好像我才是
Then my dad got mad at me, like I was the one

232
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,820
做了错事的人 
who did something wrong.

233
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,960
怎么会是这个颜色
How is it that color?

234
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:04,990
她只吃奶啊
She only eats milk.

235
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,210
我妈也没回家
And Mom hasn't been home,

236
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,310
我知道肯定出什么事了
and I know something's going on,

237
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,690
但没有人愿意告诉我是什么
but no one will tell me anything.

238
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,440
可以把爽身粉递给我吗
Uh, can you hand me the powder?

239
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,310
你知道他们怎么了吗
Do you know what's going on with them?

240
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,470
- 什么 - 我爸妈之间
- Huh? - With my mom and dad.

241
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,710
米西 我现在就感觉好像
Missy, it feels like someone

242
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,880
有人把卡车开进了我的身体
just drove a truck through my body,

243
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,130
我已经几天没睡了
I haven't slept in days.

244
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,670
我现在没法帮你
I cannot help you right now.

245
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,570
抱歉
Sorry.

246
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,180
真该死
Son of a bitch.

247
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,020
- 猪肉卷吗 - 对
- Pigs in a blanket? - Yeah.

248
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,420
烧糊了
They're burnt.

249
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,750
是的
Yeah.

250
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,370
妈妈不会烤这么久的
Mom doesn't cook them that long.

251
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,630
谢谢
Thank you.

252
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,740
你可以教我怎么扔橄榄球吗
Would you teach me how to throw a football?

253
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,810
什么 为什么
What? What? Why?

254
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,700
我想多习惯一下失败的感觉
I'm trying to get more comfortable with failure.

255
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,330
你为什么觉得自己会失败呢
What makes you think you're gonna fail?

256
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,940
因为带了"球"这个字
The word "Ball".

257
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,660
我不得不提醒你
Well, I got to warn you,

258
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,480
扔球可不是试一次就能学会的
learning to throw isn't something you get right on the first try.

259
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,120
需要练习
It... it takes practice.

260
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,040
这个练习会不会涉及挫折和沮丧
And does this practice involve setbacks and frustration?

261
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,400
- 会 - 太好了
- Yeah. - Perfect.

262
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,970
你会看到这玩意的形状
Now, you'll notice that the shape of this thing

263
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,480
更像导弹
is more like a missile, right,

264
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,120
而不是典型的弹力球
than it is your typical bouncy ball.

265
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,570
你想说的那个术语是长椭球体
The term you're looking for is prolate spheroid.

266
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,240
没想说这个 不过还是谢谢你
Wasn't looking for it, but thank you.

267
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,780
你觉得
Now, what do you think

268
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,950
让它飞出去最有效的方式是什么
is the most efficient way to get this thing to fly?

269
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,090
陀螺力矩
Gyroscopic torque.

270
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,450
就是螺旋
Spiral.

271
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,110
没错 好了
Bingo. All right,

272
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,440
现在把你的手指放在线上
now get your fingers on the laces here.

273
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,100
为什么表面都是凹凸不平的
Why is the surface all bumpy?

274
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,650
以前是用猪膀胱做的
Used to be made out of pig bladder.

275
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,130
现在不是了
Well... not anymore. It's...

276
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,620
有助于抓握 好吗
Helps with the grip. Okay?

277
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,800
手指放回去 然后用拇指
Now, fingers back on it, and get your thumb

278
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,470
包住 好了
wrapped around... There you go.

279
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,080
用另一只手扶着
All right, bring your other hand up.

280
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,080
好保持稳定
That helps keep her steady.

281
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,920
把球举到耳边
Bring the ball back to your ear.

282
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,000
准备扔的时候
And when you're ready to throw,

283
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,040
像战斧一样挥动手臂
bring your arm down like a tomahawk.

284
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,440
让球转起来 懂了吗
Get that ball spinning. All right?

285
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,970
我这样想对吗 更高的转数
And am I correct in assuming that more revolutions

286
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,100
能形成抛物线从而抵抗外力
will create a parabolic arc that resists external forces?

287
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,800
对
Sure.

288
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,580
好了 准备好了的话
All right, whenever you're ready,

289
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,930
看看能不能投到我这
let's see if you can reach me.

290
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,690
挫败和沮丧感来吧
Let the setbacks and frustration begin.

291
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,510
我的天 太棒了
Good Lord. That was incredible.

292
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,590
我看到了
Yeah, I saw it.

293
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,940
你去哪
Where you going?

294
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,370
去洗个澡 显然我现在是运动员了
To hit the showers. Apparently I'm a jock now.

295
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,730
我哄好孩子了 小菜一碟
I got the baby to settle down. Easy peasy.

296
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,050
冷静点 奶奶
Take it down a notch, Nana.

297
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,300
我会试试的 但不一定能做到
I will try, but I don't know if I can.

298
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,090
小乔在沙发睡吗
Georgie on the couch?

299
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,390
是的
Mm-hmm.

300
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,010
你的床到底有什么问题
And what exactly is it that's wrong with your bed?

301
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,700
我老公躺在上面
My husband's in it.

302
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,050
你打算一直在我这睡
So, you're just gonna keep sleeping here

303
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,400
不去解决问题吗
instead of dealing with it?

304
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,710
我要帮忙看孩子啊
I'm helping with the baby.

305
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,470
她明天还会哭的 回家去
She'll still be crying tomorrow. Go home.

306
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,980
我会的
I will.

307
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,460
只是现在需要点个人空间
I just need my space right now.

308
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,300
我懂那种感受
I know the feeling.

309
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,980
你好暴躁哦
You're cranky.

310
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,260
要我摇着你入睡吗
You want me to rock you to sleep?

311
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,400
我很擅长哦
I'm pretty good at it.

312
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,210
别碰我
Don't touch me.

313
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,300
你搞清楚
Did you ever find out

314
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,920
你妈那天去哪了吗
where your mom was the other day?

315
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,660
她在医院
She was at the hospital

316
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,030
因为你哥的小孩
for your brother's baby.

317
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,700
什么
What?

318
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,740
你知道他有孩子了吗
Did you not know he had one?

319
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,860
是个女孩 
It's a girl.

320
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,540
考试别说话
No talking during the test.

321
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,710
- 你妈在那吗 - 是
- Your mom was there? - Yeah.

322
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,280
所以我是世界上唯一一个没到场的
So I was the only person in the whole world who wasn't there.

323
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,220
看自己的试卷
Keep your eyes on your own papers.

324
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,570
我没在作弊
I'm not cheating.

325
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,210
看起来在作弊呢
Well, that's not what it looks like.

326
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,940
我想你应该知道出轨是什么样
I guess you would know what cheating looks like.

327
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,520
问问你老公就知道了
Ask your husband.

328
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,160
你是有什么毛病
What has gotten into you?

329
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,720
回答你妈妈啊
Well? Answer your mother.

330
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,250
所以你们俩只有冲我喊的时候才会对话吗
So the only time you two talk to each other is to yell at me?

331
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,680
- 当然不是 - 真的吗
- That is not true. - Oh, really?

332
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,410
那你前几晚都去哪睡了
Where have you been sleeping the last couple nights?

333
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,840
你不能这么跟我们说话
Whoa, you do not talk to us that way.

334
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,910
你也不能这样跟老师说话
And you do not talk to your teacher that way either.

335
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,830
谢尔顿也总是说这些恼人的话
Sheldon says obnoxious things all the time,

336
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,400
但就因为他特殊 所以没事
but it's fine 'cause he's special.

337
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,270
这和谢尔顿没关系
This is not about Sheldon.

338
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,020
终于有一次没他什么事了
For once.

339
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,950
我们不就忘了接你一次 别小题大做了
We forgot to pick you up one time. Cut the drama.

340
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,060
一次吗 你们这辈子都在忽视我
One time? You've been forgetting me my entire life.

341
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,610
全都围着谢尔顿转 现在小乔又有了孩子
Everything is Sheldon, and now Georgie has a baby,

342
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,150
你们又吵架
and you two are fighting.

343
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,410
我还不如隐形呢
Might as well be invisible.

344
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,940
今天你就别想了
Not today you're not.

345
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,750
? 我们是一家人 ?
We're family

346
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,840
这歌不合时宜
Not an appropriate song for this moment.

347
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,580
你好 侄女家长 小侄女
Hello, Niblingo. Little nibling.

348
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,170
怎么了 谢尔顿
What is it, Sheldon?

349
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,170
我想试试帮你安抚宝宝
I was hoping I could try to calm your baby down.

350
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,230
为什么
Why?

351
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,430
我在尝试新事物
I'm trying new things to build up a tolerance

352
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,350
以增强对挫折的耐受力
for setbacks and frustration.

353
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,320
所以你是想用我的孩子做实验吗
So you want to use my child for some kind of experiment?

354
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,360
是的
Yes.

355
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,090
行 给
Okay, here you go.

356
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,740
软猫猫 暖猫猫 小毛球猫猫
Soft kitty, warm kitty. Little ball of fur.

357
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:56,960
笑猫猫 困猫猫 呼噜呼噜呼噜
Happy kitty, sleepy kitty. Purr, purr, purr.

358
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,940
你在逗我吗
Are you freaking kidding me?

359
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,260
我对此也不觉得开心
I'm not happy about it either.

360
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,110
别啊
No, no, no, no, no, no.

361
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,100
软猫猫 小猫猫
Soft kitty, kitty, kitty.

362
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,970
谢尔顿 回来
Sheldon, come back.

363
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,590
林克莱特博士 我需要您的帮助
Dr. Linkletter, I need your help.

364
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,690
好啊
Of course.

365
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,180
我先放下手头的事 好帮你
Let me just drop everything so I can be of assistance.

366
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,190
谢谢
Thank you.

367
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,770
我正在试着接受失败
I'm trying to embrace failure,

368
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,590
我意识到社交的微妙之处
and I realized that social subtleties

369
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,520
例如讽刺偶尔会困扰我
like sarcasm can sometimes evade me.

370
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,620
不会吧
You don't say.

371
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,000
是真的
No, it's true.

372
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,770
我希望你能在我们的谈话中加入一些讽刺
And I was hoping you could pepper

373
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,310
这样我就能试着识别出来
our conversation with sarcasm, so I can try to identify it.

374
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,920
什么时候开始呢
Oh, boy, when do we start?

375
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,660
现在就很好
Now would be great.

376
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,660
谢尔顿 刚才那就是讽刺
Sheldon, that was sarcasm.

377
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,230
这样 那我再来一次
Oh, let me try again.

378
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,710
这和你的数据库有关吗
Is this about your database?

379
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,040
是的
Yes.

380
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,680
我也正在建立一个数据库
You know, I was also working on a database

381
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,940
应该比你的更有用
that I thought would be more successful than yours.

382
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,550
这也是讽刺吗
Sarcasm?

383
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,680
不是
No.

384
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,740
真要命
Oh, darn it.

385
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,900
那"不是"是讽刺吗
Wait, was the "No" Sarcasm?

386
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,480
- 不是 - 真的吗
- No. - Are you sure?

387
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,180
- 真的 -啊
- Yes. - Ugh,

388
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,770
我永远也接受不了失败
I'll never be comfortable with failure.

389
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,770
我的意思是 我也经历过类似的事
My point is, I was experiencing something similar,

390
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,780
而悲伤是不会带来捷径的
and there's no shortcut through grief.

391
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,520
至理名言啊
Those are wise words.

392
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,670
谢谢
Thank you.

393
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,360
来找你真是明智之举
It was smart I came to you.

394
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,780
你简直是羞辱和失败的专家
You're clearly an expert on humiliation and defeat.

395
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,520
讽刺吗
Sarcasm?

396
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,930
- 不是 - 你走吧
- No. - Leave.

397
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,740
- 讽刺吗 - 不是
- Sarcasm? - No.

398
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,970
再见
Bye.

399
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,940
- 回你房间去 - 行吧
- Go to your room. - Fine.

400
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,190
你还得向威尔金斯太太道歉
And you're gonna apologize to Mrs. Wilkins.

401
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,290
她离婚后就不姓威尔金斯了
That's not her name anymore.

402
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,580
你看看她
Can you believe her?

403
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,190
如果你常在她身边 可能她就不会这样了
Well, maybe this wouldn't have happened if you were around.

404
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,630
你是要把这怪到我头上吗
Are you really trying to blame this on me?

405
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,760
睡在街对面的又不是我
I'm not the one sleeping across the street.

406
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,720
我可一直陪着孩子们
I'm here with our kids.

407
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,790
你想掰扯掰扯是吗 那我们好好掰扯一下
So you want to get into this? Let's get into this.

408
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,970
你和布兰达是怎么回事
What is going on with you and Brenda?

409
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,200
- 没事啊 - 看着不像没事
- Nothing. - It doesn't seem like it.

410
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,810
怎么 你摸着良心说说
What, you're honestly saying that you don't light up

411
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,490
哪次你见着罗伯牧师不欢欣雀跃的
every time Pastor Rob's around?

412
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,010
可能是吧
Maybe I do.

413
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,530
我和他之间什么关系也没有
Nothing ever happened.

414
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,690
我不会做那种事
I wouldn't do that.

415
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,230
那你的意思是我会吗
What, you saying I would?

416
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,840
- 你觉得呢 - 我不会
- You tell me. - I wouldn't.

417
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,330
但你喜欢和她待在一起
But you like being around her.

418
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,870
现在是怎样
What happens now?

419
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,360
不知道
I don't know.

420
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,830
嘿
Hey.

421
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,570
你来了
Hi.

422
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,190
你在这儿干嘛 孩子呢
What are you doing here? Where's the baby?

423
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,360
她很好 康妮带着她
She's fine. She's with Connie.

424
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,930
我只是想休息几分钟
I just needed a couple minutes.

425
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,970
这几分钟
Which was...

426
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,330
不小心成了几小时
a couple hours ago.

427
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,710
我去看看她 除非你想去
I'll go check on her, unless you want to.

428
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,470
其实
Actually...

429
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,720
我也不知道我想要什么
I don't know what I want.

430
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,940
什么意思
What does that mean?

431
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,440
我女儿讨厌我
My daughter hates me.

432
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,160
去不去看她又有什么所谓
What difference does it make if I'm there or not?

433
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,040
- 不是那样的 -是吗
- You know that ain't true. - Really?

434
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,120
她就只会哭
Because all she does is cry,

435
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,210
把我累得要死
and I'm tired all the time,

436
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,250
连你弟弟都比我会哄她
and even your brother is better at soothing her than I am.

437
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,230
你只是有点不知所措 这很正常啊
You're just a little overwhelmed. It's normal.

438
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,400
那你为什么不会这样
Why aren't you?

439
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,770
因为我们俩不能同时崩溃
Well, we can't both be freaked out at the same time.

440
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,920
要轮流来
We got to take turns.

441
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,710
什么时候轮到你
When's your turn?

442
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,230
我已经轮过了
Already had it.

443
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,100
到医院的时候
I was so scared when I got to

444
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,160
我很害怕
the hospital, I...

445
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,620
我就回到车里开走了
I got back in my car and drove away.

446
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,980
我在生孩子的时候吗
While I was in labor?!

447
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,200
别打我 我们不是在分享崩溃时刻吗
Don't hit me. We're sharing freak-outs.

448
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,180
我还是回去了的
And I still came back.

449
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,990
我们是什么父母啊
What kind of parents are we?

450
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,640
新手父母
The new kind,

451
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,590
好心又笨手笨脚的父母
the well-meaning, dumb kind.

452
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,300
我们会越来越好的吧
We're gonna get better, right?

453
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,450
也没别的选择了
We ain't got no choice.

454
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,480
你睡吧 我去看丝丝
I'll let you sleep. I'm gonna go check on CeeCee.

455
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,050
谢谢
Thank you.

456
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,760
笑什么
What are you smiling at?

457
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,220
只是想到
Just thinking.

458
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,720
我们可能就是在这个车库有了丝丝的
We might've conceived CeeCee in this very garage.

459
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,590
你好恶心 快走
Okay, you're gross. Leave now.

460
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,740
再见
Bye.

461
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,690
你在干什么
What are you doing?

462
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,170
呃
Oh, um...

463
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,440
我只不过要在姥姥家再住一段时间
I'm just gonna be staying at Meemaw's a little bit longer.

464
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,770
好的
Okay.

465
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,320
你没事吧
You all right?

466
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,950
有事
No.

467
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,120
怎么了
What's going on?

468
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,160
我的数据库
My database...

469
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,860
我从来没有这么失败过
I've-I've never failed like this before,

470
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,680
我好害怕
and it frightens me.

471
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,780
宝贝
Oh... sweetie,

472
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,220
很遗憾 有时候
I'm sorry. Sometimes,

473
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,680
无论我们多想办成一件事
no matter how much we want things to work out,

474
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,700
也事与愿违
they just don't.

475
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,100
失败是很难应对的
Dealing with failure is a tricky business.

476
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,190
你可以直面它 然后努力克服
You can face it head on and try to overcome it.

477
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,860
做得好 妈妈
Good job, Mama.

478
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,890
也可以逃避
You can avoid it.

479
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,280
谢谢你让我继续住在这儿
Thanks for letting me stay.

480
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,400
住多久都行
For as long as you need.

481
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,250
也可以麻痹自己
You can try to drown it out.

482
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,070
或者是找个人诉说一下
Or you can try to talk to someone about it.

483
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,740
而有些人选择逃离
And some people choose to run.
