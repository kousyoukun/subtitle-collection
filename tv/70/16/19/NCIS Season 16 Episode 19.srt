1
00:00:03,512 --> 00:00:05,880
Well, you never can
predict the hitch.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,613
Bypasses go like a dream,

3
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:10,416
and now this valve just
doesn't want to be found.

4
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:12,284
The search continues.

5
00:00:12,353 --> 00:00:13,719
When I was a kid,

6
00:00:13,788 --> 00:00:15,521
my dog Arthur got lost.

7
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:17,289
I searched for him for days.

8
00:00:17,358 --> 00:00:20,759
And I hoped and I prayed...

9
00:00:20,828 --> 00:00:22,561
Did you find him, Doctor?
No.

10
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,097
But he was imaginary, so I have
to take some responsibility.

11
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,466
Hope is what you make of it.

12
00:00:27,535 --> 00:00:29,175
- Am I right?
- Mm-hmm.

13
00:00:30,538 --> 00:00:33,439
Dr. Pierce, the admiral's family
has been updated.

14
00:00:33,507 --> 00:00:34,940
Nurse Tolliver,

15
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:36,542
right on cue,

16
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,610
with the steadiest hands
in the land.

17
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:42,548
I'm attempting to hunt down
a very shy mitral here.

18
00:00:42,616 --> 00:00:45,083
Please tell me I didn't miss
the story about Arthur.

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,320
Look at that.

20
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:49,621
There it is,

21
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,457
our missing mitral valve.

22
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:53,759
And it appears to be reparable.

23
00:00:53,828 --> 00:00:55,761
Admiral, today
is your lucky day.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,266
Are those gunshots?

25
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:03,302
That's right below us.

26
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,903
Code silver.

27
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:07,639
Active shooter, ground level,
Entrance A.

28
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,241
This is not a drill.

29
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,243
Evacuate to a secure location.

30
00:01:11,312 --> 00:01:12,444
But, Doctor...
Go.

31
00:01:12,513 --> 00:01:13,846
Code silver.
Now.

32
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:15,848
Active shooter,
ground level, Entrance A.

33
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,349
This is not a drill.

34
00:01:17,418 --> 00:01:19,084
Okay, you need to go, too.

35
00:01:19,153 --> 00:01:21,086
You can't do this on your own.

36
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:23,155
If he starts to bleed,
you'll lose him.

37
00:01:23,224 --> 00:01:24,990
Faith...
Dr. Pierce.

38
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,626
I'm staying.

39
00:01:27,695 --> 00:01:28,760
All right.

40
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:29,928
Hold steady.

41
00:01:29,997 --> 00:01:31,797
Accessing the valve.

42
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:33,232
Hopes and prayers.

43
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:39,035

Morning, friends.

47
00:02:12,773 --> 00:02:14,377
- Morning.
- Hey, you need help with that?

48
00:02:14,378 --> 00:02:15,301
Nope, I got it.

49
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:17,140
You don't always have
to be a hero, you know?

50
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:18,324
People are not gonna
think less of you

51
00:02:18,325 --> 00:02:19,602
if I hold the dumpster
open while you

52
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:20,692
throw that in the trash.

53
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:22,193
I'm not getting rid of it.

54
00:02:22,262 --> 00:02:23,695
No, why should you?

55
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:26,298
That shay/chic vibe
is very hot right now.

56
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:29,501
Says Delilah.

57
00:02:29,536 --> 00:02:31,236
Actually, I read that plants go

58
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:34,239
into dormancy for long periods
of time, and I was hoping

59
00:02:34,308 --> 00:02:36,241
that Kasie might know
how to wake it up.

60
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,442
Beep, beep.

61
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:39,144
Coming through.

62
00:02:39,212 --> 00:02:40,712
Renny down
in purchasing

63
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:43,648
got all of this paper
on a fantastic sale.

64
00:02:43,717 --> 00:02:45,483
Yeah, maybe because it's green.

65
00:02:45,552 --> 00:02:47,786
Yeah. Yeah, she didn't
realize that when she bought it.

66
00:02:47,854 --> 00:02:50,789
She also didn't realize
it was nonreturnable.

67
00:02:50,857 --> 00:02:53,091
I found her inconsolable
in the copy room.

68
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,826
But I reassured her

69
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:56,895
that I would save her job

70
00:02:56,964 --> 00:02:59,564
by distributing this
as scratch paper.

71
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:01,333
Talk about heroes.
Look at this guy.

72
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:03,335
They can't fire her
for accidentally ordering

73
00:03:03,403 --> 00:03:05,136
the wrong color paper.

74
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:07,305
You guys,
let's not risk it, okay?

75
00:03:07,374 --> 00:03:09,808
If the director asks, just say

76
00:03:09,876 --> 00:03:11,643
green scratch paper
really helps you,

77
00:03:11,712 --> 00:03:13,478
I don't know, solve more crimes.

78
00:03:13,547 --> 00:03:14,946
You want me to take that

79
00:03:15,015 --> 00:03:16,848
to the dumpster for you?
- No, I do not.

80
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:18,450
She thinks it's sleeping.

81
00:03:18,518 --> 00:03:20,018
Oh.

82
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:21,619
Yeah, yeah.

83
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:24,255
No. No, there's not a lick
of green in there, Bishop.

84
00:03:24,324 --> 00:03:26,257
I'm sorry,
but this is way dead.

85
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:28,793
Okay, I wouldn't call that
an official test.

86
00:03:28,862 --> 00:03:30,362
Hey, the guy knows dead, Bishop.

87
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,763
Since when do you care so much

88
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:33,264
- about plants anyway?
- Gear up.

89
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,433
- Let's go, right now.
- What's going on, Boss?

90
00:03:35,502 --> 00:03:37,602
Active shooter, Liberty Naval.

91
00:03:37,671 --> 00:03:39,971
Wait, at the hospital?

92
00:03:40,073 --> 00:03:41,639
Oh, my God.

93
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,386
This is an active shooter...

94
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,944
Go, go, go, go!

95
00:03:46,013 --> 00:03:47,846
Move it!

96
00:03:47,914 --> 00:03:49,354
Failure to comply

97
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,116
is a criminal offense.

98
00:03:57,424 --> 00:03:59,691
Folks, we appreciate
your patience.

99
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,904
I know you want to get home to
your families, but it's crucial

100
00:04:01,928 --> 00:04:03,840
we get all of your statements
as soon as possible.

101
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:05,563
Gibbs, this is Captain Crawford,

102
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:07,710
commanding officer at the hospital.
- Captain, what do we got?

103
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:09,334
Shooter fled
the immediate scene on foot.

104
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:11,302
Where he went from there
is unknown.

105
00:04:11,371 --> 00:04:13,405
MPD was first on the scene.

106
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:15,233
They've already blocked off
a one-mile radius

107
00:04:15,275 --> 00:04:16,875
with checkpoints.
- SWAT did a sweep.

108
00:04:16,943 --> 00:04:18,309
Building is cleared.

109
00:04:18,378 --> 00:04:20,378
Only people still inside
are essential staff

110
00:04:20,447 --> 00:04:22,414
and those patients
that couldn't be moved.

111
00:04:22,482 --> 00:04:24,093
Wounded are being transferred
to Washington General.

112
00:04:24,117 --> 00:04:25,350
What about the shooter?

113
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:27,352
Caucasian male wearing
Marine utilities

114
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:29,154
and carrying a black duffel bag.

115
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:30,655
No name tag on his uniform.

116
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,004
He grabbed an AR-15
from his bag

117
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,705
and started shooting
the lobby randomly.

118
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,808
He was wearing an
eight-point hat pulled down low.

119
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,054
Uh, our witnesses
can't seem to agree

120
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,745
on a description
of his face.

121
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,092
But there is still a good amount
of people yet to be interviewed.

122
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,849
Talk to everybody
who was inside.

123
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,918
I want all accounts
logged through us.

124
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,185
- On it.
- Captain.

125
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,054
Anything I can do
to help you find

126
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,590
the son of a bitch
who did this, you say the word.

127
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,260
Excuse me.

128
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,969
Do you have a list of victims?
I need one.

129
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,497
- Jack.
- Oh, Gibbs. There you are.

130
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,265
Do you have the list of, uh...

131
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,900
One dead, 12 wounded.

132
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,137
Are you sure?

133
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,573
One of the wounded
is an off-duty cop.

134
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,741
Witnesses said he returned fire.

135
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,376
That's him.

136
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,745
Shot the shooter
once in the shoulder.

137
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,180
He sent him running.

138
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,282
Are you sure
this list is complete?

139
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,585
Unless someone
tells me otherwise.

140
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,688
Look, MPD is
stretched thin.

141
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,089
Gonna jump in
and help me

142
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,569
with some of these
witness statements?

143
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,526
Jack. Did you hear me?

144
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,194
All hands are on deck.

145
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,696
No.

146
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,097
What?

147
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,566
I'm sorry, Gibbs,
I can't help you.

148
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:38,636
I'm recusing myself
from this investigation.

149
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,237
Want to tell me why?

150
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,939
Jack!

151
00:05:54,777 --> 00:05:56,243
McGee, give me a sitrep.

152
00:05:56,311 --> 00:05:57,844
Well, no activity
at our checkpoints.

153
00:05:57,913 --> 00:05:59,479
BOLO's out wide on our shooter,

154
00:05:59,548 --> 00:06:01,848
but we still have no viable
description of his face.

155
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:03,357
We have a hospital
full of witnesses,

156
00:06:03,385 --> 00:06:04,796
and you're telling me
we got nothing?

157
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,678
Well, I wouldn't say "nothing."

158
00:06:05,678 --> 00:06:06,214
What?

159
00:06:06,238 --> 00:06:08,222
An attack
like this happens

160
00:06:08,223 --> 00:06:10,357
in a first-floor lobby,
common sense says

161
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:12,704
the shooter came through the
front entrance, but he didn't.

162
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:13,960
He came off an elevator.

163
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:15,762
- He was on another floor?
- Yep.

164
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:17,264
We just don't know which one
or why.

165
00:06:17,332 --> 00:06:18,465
All right. Security footage?

166
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:20,167
- On my way to get it now.
- Yeah.

167
00:06:21,336 --> 00:06:23,003
- Gibbs.
- Hey.

168
00:06:23,071 --> 00:06:24,538
Want to take a look at this?

169
00:06:24,606 --> 00:06:25,806
I got the shooter's blood

170
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:27,674
on the road
and on the barricade.

171
00:06:27,743 --> 00:06:30,744
He bypassed the
security gate on foot.

172
00:06:32,347 --> 00:06:33,947
He left a trail of blood
along the way.

173
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:35,515
Where does the trail end?

174
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:36,983
Down the street.

175
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:38,830
It looks like he got into a car
and drove off.

176
00:06:38,854 --> 00:06:41,455
Great. Means he's already
outside the checkpoints.

177
00:06:41,523 --> 00:06:43,223
Come on, damn it.

178
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:44,224
There a problem?

179
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:49,563
I need to take a swab, and
I can't find my gloves.

180
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:52,966
Thanks.

181
00:06:53,035 --> 00:06:56,002
You know, man, uh,
other kinds of crimes,

182
00:06:56,071 --> 00:06:57,704
I've learned to process.

183
00:06:57,773 --> 00:07:01,408
But when a guy shoots random,
innocent people, it just...

184
00:07:02,878 --> 00:07:04,811
...it makes my inner swan
come out.

185
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,813
What?

186
00:07:06,882 --> 00:07:09,649
Okay, so swans, they-they look
like they're really nice,

187
00:07:09,718 --> 00:07:11,518
but you push their buttons,

188
00:07:11,587 --> 00:07:14,020
you know, those birds
can go dark real quick.

189
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:18,725
Mass shootings just, uh,
make me want to go swan.

190
00:07:18,794 --> 00:07:22,162
Our priority is the shooter.
All right? Let's get this guy.

191
00:07:22,231 --> 00:07:23,430
- Yeah.
- All right.

192
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:25,031
Hey, Gibbs.

193
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,969
Can you please not make me
talk to Sloane again?

194
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:32,439
I'm past my quota for the month.

195
00:07:32,508 --> 00:07:34,207
Agent Gibbs.

196
00:07:34,276 --> 00:07:36,087
I have the civilian
employee list you requested.

197
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:37,310
Yeah, thanks.

198
00:07:39,414 --> 00:07:41,481
Something in particular
you're looking for?

199
00:07:49,324 --> 00:07:51,858
Chief Petty Officer
Diana Sanchez.

200
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:53,860
There you are.

201
00:07:55,664 --> 00:07:57,664
Nice to meet you.

202
00:08:01,003 --> 00:08:03,270
List of victims is confirmed.

203
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:05,872
12 wounded, nine of them
still critical.

204
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:07,874
So far, she's our only fatality.

205
00:08:07,943 --> 00:08:10,310
She took two shots
to the chest, one to the leg.

206
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:11,978
Kasie has the slugs now.

207
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:13,980
I was just looking up
more about her

208
00:08:14,049 --> 00:08:18,885
so she wouldn't be just another
body on the table, you know?

209
00:08:18,954 --> 00:08:20,487
She was from Austin.

210
00:08:20,556 --> 00:08:23,557
She oversaw
hospital admissions.

211
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,593
Mother of two boys,
five and three.

212
00:08:26,662 --> 00:08:30,797
Her favorite movie
was <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

213
00:08:30,866 --> 00:08:33,333
I spoke to her husband.

214
00:08:33,402 --> 00:08:35,380
Feels like you wanted to
get to know her, too, huh?

215
00:08:35,404 --> 00:08:38,905
Awful as this is, we could be
looking at dozens of bodies.

216
00:08:38,974 --> 00:08:40,952
That off-duty cop, he was...
he was thinking on his feet,

217
00:08:40,976 --> 00:08:42,642
firing back like that.

218
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:44,556
I'm assuming he was hit, too,
he's one of the criticals?

219
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,012
- Officer...
- Moseby.

220
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:47,681
- Moseby.
- Yeah, he's still in surgery.

221
00:08:47,749 --> 00:08:51,818
Hopefully, we, uh... we won't
have to be back here again.

222
00:08:56,825 --> 00:08:58,592
Kasie.

223
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,493
- I have the shooter's blood.
- Oh, great.

224
00:09:00,562 --> 00:09:02,762
Mass Spec is rebooting.
I'll get started in a minute.

225
00:09:02,831 --> 00:09:04,965
By the way, the dumpster
out back is full.

226
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:07,133
Hey, what? I'm not
throwing this away.

227
00:09:07,202 --> 00:09:08,468
I need your help waking it up.

228
00:09:08,537 --> 00:09:09,669
Yeah, okay.

229
00:09:09,738 --> 00:09:12,806
Okay, listen,
look at me.

230
00:09:12,874 --> 00:09:15,375
Mass shootings make me
want to go swan.

231
00:09:15,444 --> 00:09:18,111
I was gonna punch something, but
then I walked by Bishop's desk

232
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,146
and I saw this thing,
so I'm gonna do this

233
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:22,449
instead of punching.
- That was a lot of information,

234
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:25,051
most of which I am not
entirely clear on.

235
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,554
But I am getting that
you want to repurpose

236
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:30,390
your negative energy
in a positive way?

237
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:33,126
Yeah, that, so... what do we do?

238
00:09:33,195 --> 00:09:34,961
Do we, uh,

239
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,129
throw some water
on it?

240
00:09:36,198 --> 00:09:38,632
- Nick, this thing is dead.
- Damn it.

241
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,567
But I will... I will
call my botanist friend

242
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:42,302
and ask for a second
opinion, okay, Nick?

243
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:43,803
Okay, buddy?

244
00:09:43,872 --> 00:09:45,505
Oh, got something.

245
00:09:45,574 --> 00:09:48,708
We've been combing through
hospital security footage.

246
00:09:48,777 --> 00:09:51,678
The stuff of the actual
shooting was awful to watch.

247
00:09:51,747 --> 00:09:53,734
Couldn't get a good angle
of the shooter's face.

248
00:09:53,735 --> 00:09:55,427
But you were able to figure out where
he was beforehand?

249
00:09:55,451 --> 00:09:56,617
Yeah.

250
00:09:56,618 --> 00:09:59,019
Before he took the elevator
down to the ground floor

251
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:01,388
and started shooting,
he was on the third floor.

252
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:04,658
That's got to be him.

253
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:08,028
Marine utilities, black bag.

254
00:10:08,096 --> 00:10:09,663
That nurse is talking to him.

255
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:11,442
Seems like she might've gotten
a good look at his face.

256
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:12,999
Who is she?

257
00:10:13,068 --> 00:10:15,669
I'll see how close I can
zoom in without distortion.

258
00:10:16,905 --> 00:10:19,272
We get a good look
at her badge here.

259
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:23,510
Operating room RN,
Faith Tolliver.

260
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:25,679
All right, Faith Tolliver.

261
00:10:25,747 --> 00:10:27,447
Checking the log.

262
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:29,596
Why didn't she say something
when we interviewed her?

263
00:10:30,786 --> 00:10:32,063
She hasn't been interviewed yet.

264
00:10:32,087 --> 00:10:34,120
- Why not?
- 'Cause she didn't evacuate.

265
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:35,722
She probably doesn't
even know yet

266
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,357
that she saw
the shooter's face.

267
00:10:37,426 --> 00:10:39,959
Says here that she stayed
inside the hospital

268
00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:41,795
to assist in
an open-heart surgery.

269
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:46,199
Brave woman.

270
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:57,510
Civilian O.R. nurse,
Faith Tolliver.

271
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,049
What do you want me to say?

272
00:11:03,118 --> 00:11:04,951
Back at the hospital,
Jack, I asked you

273
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,319
a question, and
you walked away.

274
00:11:06,388 --> 00:11:08,088
I did not think
you were the type.

275
00:11:08,156 --> 00:11:12,158
Hey, listen, Gibbs,
I am not some underling

276
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:14,427
that you can manipulate
with a look, if you forgot.

277
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:17,230
- No, you can't put this on me.
- Why not?

278
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:19,132
World-class investigator
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

279
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:22,402
That's some fancy research
you did behind my back.

280
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:23,903
I had enough to go on.

281
00:11:23,972 --> 00:11:25,572
Yeah, well, next time
we have a drink,

282
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,907
remind me to keep my mouth shut,

283
00:11:27,976 --> 00:11:29,609
or better yet,
remind me to stay home!

284
00:11:29,678 --> 00:11:30,910
Hey! I should
be out there

285
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:33,079
investigating,
not wasting my time

286
00:11:33,148 --> 00:11:35,014
on something
that you can tell me.

287
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,083
Yes, okay? Yes.

288
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:39,786
She is my biological daughter.

289
00:11:39,855 --> 00:11:41,254
Okay?

290
00:11:41,323 --> 00:11:42,270
Can we get on
with our lives now?

291
00:11:42,294 --> 00:11:43,390
No, we can't,

292
00:11:43,391 --> 00:11:45,859
because your daughter
is the only witness we have

293
00:11:45,927 --> 00:11:47,761
who may have seen
our shooter's face,

294
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:49,496
and she's on the way in.

295
00:11:50,532 --> 00:11:51,831
What?

296
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:53,366
Now.

297
00:11:53,435 --> 00:11:55,268
No.

298
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,839
Gibbs, I haven't been
in the same room with her

299
00:11:59,908 --> 00:12:01,274
since the day she was born.

300
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:04,344
Jack, my priority

301
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:06,312
is the shooter.

302
00:12:06,381 --> 00:12:10,450
Apart from that,
I'm on your side.

303
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,187
She doesn't know me.

304
00:12:14,256 --> 00:12:18,892
Gibbs, Faith doesn't know
who I am.

305
00:12:20,228 --> 00:12:22,729
And I want to keep it that way.

306
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,764
Yes, Madam Secretary,
we will turn over every rock

307
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,367
on the Eastern seaboard
until we find this guy.

308
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:40,568
Yep.

309
00:12:40,637 --> 00:12:42,003
That and then some.

310
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:43,504
Uh, copy that, ma'am.

311
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:45,573
Yes, I-I'll keep you apprised.

312
00:12:47,777 --> 00:12:51,045
Shooter's blood was not
in the DoD's database.

313
00:12:51,114 --> 00:12:52,546
- Not a Marine.
- I heard.

314
00:12:52,615 --> 00:12:54,415
Any theories as to why
a civilian

315
00:12:54,484 --> 00:12:57,051
would dress up like a Marine
and shoot up a Navy hospital?

316
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,297
Do you want me
to stand here guessing

317
00:12:58,321 --> 00:12:59,331
or go out and find the guy?

318
00:12:59,355 --> 00:13:01,289
I'll see you later.

319
00:13:01,357 --> 00:13:02,556
Gibbs.

320
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,425
You've spoken
to Agent Sloane?

321
00:13:04,494 --> 00:13:07,428
She recused herself
from this investigation.

322
00:13:07,497 --> 00:13:08,629
You know why?

323
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:10,431
Do you?

324
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,466
I don't feel
comfortable

325
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:13,934
talking about her personal...

326
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:17,938
Makes two of us.

327
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:20,207
Okay, hi. Hello.
I'm standing right out here,

328
00:13:20,276 --> 00:13:22,176
and this conversation
is excruciating.

329
00:13:22,245 --> 00:13:23,485
You both know everything, so...

330
00:13:23,546 --> 00:13:25,246
get over it.
- All right, good talk, Gibbs.

331
00:13:25,315 --> 00:13:27,548
Faith is waiting for you
in the conference room.

332
00:13:27,617 --> 00:13:29,083
Okay? W-Wait.

333
00:13:29,152 --> 00:13:31,886
Just make sure
you let her talk.

334
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:34,588
She's likely traumatized, so you
need to be sensitive to that,

335
00:13:34,657 --> 00:13:37,291
and-and look out
for her nonverbal cues.

336
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,492
Are you gonna take notes?

337
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:40,928
- What?
- What?

338
00:13:40,997 --> 00:13:42,897
What?

339
00:13:42,965 --> 00:13:45,066
Agent Sloane, would you like
to be in that room?

340
00:13:45,134 --> 00:13:48,069
What? No. Oh...
Gibbs will do fine.

341
00:13:48,137 --> 00:13:50,137
Yeah, he will,
but what about you?

342
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:55,910
Right. No, right, I can, uh...
I can handle that.

343
00:13:55,978 --> 00:13:57,645
I-I would just be
an extra set of

344
00:13:57,714 --> 00:14:00,981
eyes and ears, and she doesn't
even know who I am, so...

345
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,316
Great.

346
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:06,721
Wow.

347
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:13,427
The hell is this for?

348
00:14:18,534 --> 00:14:19,667
Ms. Tolliver.

349
00:14:19,736 --> 00:14:21,302
I'm Special Agent Gibbs.

350
00:14:21,371 --> 00:14:23,471
Faith. Call me Faith.

351
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:25,940
This is Special
Agent Sloane.

352
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:27,475
Hi.

353
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,609
How are you?

354
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:30,544
Fine. Nice to meet you.

355
00:14:30,613 --> 00:14:32,279
Would it be okay
if we just get started?

356
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:34,548
I'd like to get back to
work as soon as possible.

357
00:14:34,617 --> 00:14:36,217
- Sure.
-Yeah.

358
00:14:36,285 --> 00:14:37,852
We're listening,
whenever you're ready.

359
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,688
Start whenever
you're comfortable.

360
00:14:40,757 --> 00:14:43,691
I didn't even know
that I had spoken to him.

361
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,192
I mean...

362
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:49,964
I didn't know that he was
the one who... um...

363
00:14:50,032 --> 00:14:53,901
Uh, Faith, take your time.
It's okay.

364
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:57,905
Okay. I was updating a patient's
family on his surgery

365
00:14:57,974 --> 00:15:00,975
when I saw a man in uniform
walk out of the break room.

366
00:15:01,043 --> 00:15:03,077
- Any idea what he was doing there?
- No.

367
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:05,980
I didn't recognize him,
but that's not unusual.

368
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:07,181
Sometimes,

369
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,216
family or friends
will visit staff

370
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:10,918
in the break room for a lunch

371
00:15:10,987 --> 00:15:12,686
or coffee.
- You talked to him?

372
00:15:12,755 --> 00:15:16,757
Yes, because he looked like
he might have been lost,

373
00:15:16,826 --> 00:15:20,027
so I asked him
if he needed any help.

374
00:15:20,096 --> 00:15:22,863
He said no, he got
in the elevator,

375
00:15:22,932 --> 00:15:24,865
I went back
to the O.R.,

376
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:27,501
and then we heard the...

377
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,504
the shots.

378
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:31,739
Sorry.

379
00:15:33,342 --> 00:15:36,744
Chief Sanchez,
the woman who was...

380
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:39,480
was killed, sh...

381
00:15:41,484 --> 00:15:43,751
...sh-she was a friend.

382
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,085
Sorry.

383
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:51,058
Um, Faith, do you think

384
00:15:51,127 --> 00:15:53,461
you could describe
this man for us?

385
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:57,231
Uh, yes, he was...

386
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,067
young, dark hair...

387
00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:02,036
I'd like you to sit
with our forensic scientist,

388
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:03,270
come up with a composite.

389
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:05,139
I don't know if I

390
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,242
can remember him clearly enough
for that. I'm sorry.

391
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:12,546
Oh, not to worry, you've done
a great deal already just

392
00:16:12,615 --> 00:16:13,948
by being here.
Thank you.

393
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:16,050
I'd like you to try
the composite.

394
00:16:16,118 --> 00:16:17,751
Sometimes,
we remember

395
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,286
more than we think.

396
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:22,490
It is something you could do
for Chief Sanchez.

397
00:16:24,894 --> 00:16:26,293
You're right.

398
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:29,363
Yes. Of course. I-I'll try.

399
00:16:34,637 --> 00:16:36,337
So that's our guy, huh?

400
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:37,972
- Looks like a kid.
- Ooh!

401
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,907
I'll tell you what,
doing a composite

402
00:16:39,976 --> 00:16:42,443
after a traumatic event
is no joke.

403
00:16:42,512 --> 00:16:43,844
Faith Tolliver
sat in here

404
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:45,846
for two hours
on eye shapes alone.

405
00:16:45,915 --> 00:16:48,193
- What are you doing with my plant?
- Giving it back to Nick.

406
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:50,251
Hey, what are you
doing with my plant?

407
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:52,586
Repurposing negative energy.

408
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:54,288
Oh, that's the thing
where mass shootings

409
00:16:54,357 --> 00:16:55,923
make you want to go swan?

410
00:16:57,593 --> 00:16:59,493
Kasie, wait, you said
you were gonna help me.

411
00:16:59,562 --> 00:17:01,162
This thing still looks
like a tumbleweed.

412
00:17:01,197 --> 00:17:04,098
Yeah, I video-chatted with
my friend, Bob the botanist.

413
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,133
He said that thing's
been dead for years.

414
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:07,846
No plant can survive
dormancy for that long.

415
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:08,936
Are you sure?

416
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:10,671
Yeah. Also, Bishop,

417
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,973
what were you doing
with a dead plant in your house

418
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:14,808
for years?

419
00:17:14,877 --> 00:17:17,444
Did we walk over here 'cause
there was a ding or not?

420
00:17:17,513 --> 00:17:18,846
Oh, yes.

421
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:20,881
Faith Tolliver said
she saw the shooter

422
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,828
coming out of the break room
on the third floor.

423
00:17:22,852 --> 00:17:24,985
- What was he doing there?
- That is the question.

424
00:17:25,054 --> 00:17:26,798
There's no security cameras
in the break room,

425
00:17:26,822 --> 00:17:29,023
but I asked the agent
assigned to the hospital

426
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:32,226
to send over some photos.
Hence the ding.

427
00:17:32,295 --> 00:17:35,963
And we have several
views here...

428
00:17:36,032 --> 00:17:37,164
Hold on.

429
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:38,532
Wait.

430
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:41,135
What's that on the floor?

431
00:17:41,203 --> 00:17:42,369
Looks like an outline.

432
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:44,572
Yeah, like something big
was sitting there

433
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,206
and left some
kind of mark.

434
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:47,641
What was it?

435
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,410
An industrial-size cooler.

436
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:51,245
I just confirmed
with Captain Crawford.

437
00:17:51,314 --> 00:17:53,581
Two months ago, the hospital
did some rearranging

438
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:55,015
as part
of a renovation.

439
00:17:55,084 --> 00:17:57,217
Hmm. Break room
used to be something else.

440
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:59,253
Yeah, a med room,
and the cooler that was there

441
00:17:59,322 --> 00:18:00,988
was used to store medications.

442
00:18:01,057 --> 00:18:02,701
Possible the shooter didn't
know about the renovation.

443
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:04,325
Which also means
it's possible he was

444
00:18:04,393 --> 00:18:06,160
in the break room
looking for drugs.

445
00:18:06,228 --> 00:18:09,163
Look alive, Team Gibbs. We got
a hit from Kasie's composite.

446
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:11,265
We gearing up?
Like a clock, baby.

447
00:18:11,334 --> 00:18:12,900
Multiple members
of the public called in

448
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:15,169
I.D.'ing him as
18-year-old Evan Sykes.

449
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:17,404
Lives with his father
in Laurel, Maryland.

450
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:21,008
NCIS.

451
00:18:37,526 --> 00:18:41,028
Boss, looks like he dug
the bullet out of his shoulder.

452
00:18:41,097 --> 00:18:42,696
Patched himself up
best he could.

453
00:18:43,966 --> 00:18:45,966
Place is clear.
Looks like he bolted.

454
00:18:46,035 --> 00:18:47,201
Evan!

455
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:50,771
I called you ten times.

456
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,339
Oh, my God.

457
00:18:54,677 --> 00:18:55,709
Evan!

458
00:18:55,778 --> 00:18:57,411
- NCIS.
- Freeze. - Where is he?

459
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,612
- Where's my son?
- Hold on.

460
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:00,414
Get off of me!

461
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:01,882
Evan!

462
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:03,917
Get off me! Evan!

463
00:19:04,091 --> 00:19:07,893
Hey, the cuffs stay on
until you settle down.

464
00:19:07,962 --> 00:19:09,228
What happened
to my son?

465
00:19:09,296 --> 00:19:10,562
Evan!

466
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:11,631
Gibbs.

467
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:16,313
He did something on his laptop
before he left.

468
00:19:16,337 --> 00:19:18,403
There's blood
on the keyboard.

469
00:19:20,841 --> 00:19:23,108
What are these papers?

470
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,287
Bishop.

471
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:37,823
He stood right here.

472
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:40,659
More blood over there?

473
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,532
Ammo box.

474
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,434
Good for an AR-15.

475
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,238
Empty.

476
00:19:53,307 --> 00:19:55,140
He's restocked.

477
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:57,509
He's planning something else.

478
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:12,253
I heard you guys are
using Renny's scrap paper

479
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:14,688
to help crack the case.
What is going on?

480
00:20:14,757 --> 00:20:17,992
Oh, I see why you needed
the recycling bin.

481
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:19,326
Oh, is that, uh...

482
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:20,728
That is Evan Sykes.

483
00:20:20,797 --> 00:20:22,797
Blood analysis confirmed
he's our shooter.

484
00:20:22,865 --> 00:20:24,532
Ugh, laptop's a bust.

485
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,700
Hard drive's wiped clean.
Nothing's recoverable.

486
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:28,369
But before
it was wiped,

487
00:20:28,438 --> 00:20:30,237
his computer as
infected with a virus

488
00:20:30,306 --> 00:20:32,073
that sends a file to
the printer queue.

489
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:34,041
Like, a file from his computer?

490
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,111
No, like, thousands
of pages of gibberish.

491
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,547
Well, I guess, uh, even bad guys

492
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:41,715
get computer viruses just
like the rest of us, huh?

493
00:20:41,784 --> 00:20:42,995
Yeah, Evan tried
to print something

494
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:44,285
before he left his house.

495
00:20:44,353 --> 00:20:46,120
Once he realized
that it was in line

496
00:20:46,189 --> 00:20:48,456
behind all this craziness,
he canceled the print job.

497
00:20:48,524 --> 00:20:50,891
His document only got
about ten-percent spooled.

498
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,893
When it finally does print,
hopefully it'll be

499
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:55,129
enough to give us something.

500
00:20:55,198 --> 00:20:56,897
You really have to look
at every page?

501
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:59,867
I mean, can't you just wait
until the printer stops?

502
00:20:59,936 --> 00:21:01,402
Will you people
let me be?

503
00:21:01,471 --> 00:21:02,970
It feels right
to look at every page,

504
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,638
so I'm-a look at every page.

505
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:06,307
Yeah, r-right, yeah.

506
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,542
When I look at this green paper,
it makes me think of,

507
00:21:08,611 --> 00:21:11,045
uh, the knights
of the Middle Ages, you know?

508
00:21:11,114 --> 00:21:13,380
They used to put green
in their coats of arms

509
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:16,150
to signify hope
and loyalty of love.

510
00:21:16,219 --> 00:21:18,452
Which actually reminds me
of an epic tale of hope.

511
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:20,287
First, I've got Torres
going swan.

512
00:21:20,356 --> 00:21:22,323
Now I got you going Mallard.

513
00:21:23,493 --> 00:21:25,292
Hmm, thank you.

514
00:21:26,996 --> 00:21:29,663
Oh, it's processing
Evan's print job.

515
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,467
Well, that ten percent
did not give us much.

516
00:21:33,536 --> 00:21:35,102
It's the top
of a spreadsheet.

517
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:36,770
Look at the
column headings.

518
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:39,406
Liberty, Ice
Station, Willow Den.

519
00:21:39,475 --> 00:21:41,108
Liberty must mean
the hospital.

520
00:21:41,177 --> 00:21:43,344
And isn't the Ice Station
a skating rink?

521
00:21:43,412 --> 00:21:45,479
This could be
a list of targets.

522
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:47,748
This spreadsheet could be
where he saved his research.

523
00:21:47,817 --> 00:21:49,817
Okay, uh, then,
what's Willow Den?

524
00:21:52,388 --> 00:21:53,787
Oh, my God.

525
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:55,589
It's an elementary school
near the hospital.

526
00:21:55,658 --> 00:21:57,124
We got to find this guy now.

527
00:21:59,595 --> 00:22:01,428
<i>He's my son.</i>

528
00:22:01,497 --> 00:22:04,298
He's not
what you think he is.

529
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:06,100
Oh, yeah, we
got that part.

530
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:07,601
You're talking
in circles.

531
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,303
I didn't know
he was planning this.

532
00:22:09,372 --> 00:22:11,172
I didn't even know he had a gun.

533
00:22:12,742 --> 00:22:14,175
Up until six years ago,

534
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,510
he was good.
- What happened six years ago?

535
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,047
Evan's brother Christopher
went to prison.

536
00:22:20,116 --> 00:22:21,615
- He's still there.
- For what?

537
00:22:21,684 --> 00:22:23,717
Drunk driving.

538
00:22:23,786 --> 00:22:26,654
Uh, a family of four was killed.

539
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:29,156
When Christopher
went to prison,

540
00:22:29,225 --> 00:22:32,359
Evan just started to spiral.

541
00:22:32,428 --> 00:22:35,529
He just wasn't himself.
He was... so angry.

542
00:22:36,632 --> 00:22:38,365
Why'd he target Liberty Naval?

543
00:22:38,434 --> 00:22:40,501
His brother was a Marine.

544
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,736
In his mind, the
military could have

545
00:22:42,805 --> 00:22:45,573
pushed for a lighter sentence.
- So Evan was angry

546
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:47,641
that his guilty brother
was put away, so he decided

547
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,910
to gun down a whole lobby
full of innocent people?

548
00:22:49,979 --> 00:22:51,645
I really don't see
the logic in that.

549
00:22:51,714 --> 00:22:53,714
Evan have a history of drug use?

550
00:22:53,783 --> 00:22:55,886
He stayed away from all that
because of what happened to his brother.

551
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,318
Oh, it didn't
happen to him.

552
00:22:57,386 --> 00:22:58,819
He got wasted,
got behind the wheel

553
00:22:58,888 --> 00:23:00,521
and took out an entire family.

554
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,556
- And then there's Evan...
- Hey, Nick.

555
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,558
No.

556
00:23:04,627 --> 00:23:06,026
He's right.

557
00:23:06,095 --> 00:23:08,696
Tell me how to help you.

558
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:10,731
Ice Station skating rink.

559
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,334
Willow Den School.
What is he gonna hit next?

560
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:18,772
I don't know why
he'd attack either.

561
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:21,408
They got to have something
to do with his brother.

562
00:23:21,477 --> 00:23:22,877
And I'm telling you
that they don't.

563
00:23:22,912 --> 00:23:24,578
Enough.

564
00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:28,749
Well, where would Evan go?

565
00:23:28,818 --> 00:23:31,518
Where is he hiding out?

566
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:34,922
Hey, look at me.

567
00:23:36,626 --> 00:23:38,058
Where is he?

568
00:23:38,127 --> 00:23:40,594
I don't know.

569
00:23:40,663 --> 00:23:42,396
When you find him...

570
00:23:42,465 --> 00:23:44,331
please don't hurt him.

571
00:23:46,602 --> 00:23:48,202
I'm begging you.

572
00:23:49,605 --> 00:23:50,938
Please.

573
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:52,273
It's hard to watch.

574
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:55,075
From what he's saying,
Evan Sykes is unhinged.

575
00:23:55,144 --> 00:23:57,478
Willow Den School is closed
for a staff retreat.

576
00:23:57,546 --> 00:24:00,614
Skating rink ignored our advice
to shut down, so we bolstered their security.

577
00:24:01,595 --> 00:24:01,949
What about Faith?

578
00:24:02,018 --> 00:24:03,317
She saw his face.

579
00:24:03,386 --> 00:24:05,219
Hospital
full of witnesses, Jack.

580
00:24:05,288 --> 00:24:06,465
Unlikely Faith
would be targeted.

581
00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:07,821
- Leon...
- The agent assigned

582
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,257
to the hospital
will look out for her there.

583
00:24:10,326 --> 00:24:11,825
Gibbs offered to post someone

584
00:24:11,894 --> 00:24:13,661
outside her residence,
but she declined.

585
00:24:13,729 --> 00:24:15,929
Said she wanted
to put this all behind her.

586
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:18,732
Faith is a pretty strong
young lady.

587
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:21,068
Interesting,
her location, though.

588
00:24:21,137 --> 00:24:23,103
What do you mean?

589
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:24,972
That the two of you
ended up in the same city.

590
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,842
Jack, you okay?

591
00:24:29,745 --> 00:24:31,412
Hey.

592
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,120
Officer Moseby pulled
through his surgery.

593
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:34,493
I'm gonna head over
and talk to him.

594
00:24:34,517 --> 00:24:36,517
Gibbs will want to join you.

595
00:24:36,585 --> 00:24:38,452
This interrogation
is pretty much over.

596
00:24:38,521 --> 00:24:39,987
Wouldn't you say?

597
00:24:48,998 --> 00:24:50,464
Doctor.

598
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:52,933
Doctor, hold up,
please. NCIS.

599
00:24:53,002 --> 00:24:54,601
We're looking to see

600
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,503
Officer Moseby
as soon as possible.

601
00:24:56,572 --> 00:24:57,938
I need to check
his vitals first.

602
00:24:58,007 --> 00:25:00,107
It shouldn't take long.

603
00:25:01,577 --> 00:25:03,110
I am never gonna
look at hospitals

604
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:05,646
the same way again.

605
00:25:05,715 --> 00:25:07,681
Hey. Um...

606
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,317
I don't know if you heard about
me bringing in this plant.

607
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:13,153
Had a few other things
going on, Bishop.

608
00:25:13,222 --> 00:25:14,621
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I know.

609
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,824
It's just, the plant,
it's from...

610
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:19,293
Ziva's office.

611
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,563
You said you were clearing out.

612
00:25:22,631 --> 00:25:24,331
I am. I just...
I thought you might

613
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,034
have an opinion about...
me trying to save it.

614
00:25:27,103 --> 00:25:28,635
A plant?

615
00:25:28,704 --> 00:25:30,070
Yeah.

616
00:25:30,139 --> 00:25:32,506
You see this?
You get personally involved,

617
00:25:32,575 --> 00:25:34,141
you can't move on.

618
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,409
Gibbs...

619
00:25:35,478 --> 00:25:39,079
if you know,
I need you to say it.

620
00:25:40,449 --> 00:25:42,116
I know what?

621
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:48,555
Nothing.

622
00:25:48,624 --> 00:25:50,391
He's ready for you now.

623
00:25:54,897 --> 00:25:57,498
<i>Took one in the stomach.</i>

624
00:25:58,567 --> 00:26:01,001
Ripped apart my intestines.

625
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,937
The other one missed my
heart by a half an inch.

626
00:26:04,006 --> 00:26:06,340
I won't be running a
marathon anytime soon.

627
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,010
But, you know...

628
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,678
I'm lucky.

629
00:26:11,747 --> 00:26:14,081
Everyone in the hospital
was lucky you were there.

630
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,418
I know I hit him once, but...

631
00:26:17,486 --> 00:26:20,387
I didn't really
even see his face.

632
00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:23,390
I didn't see where he
came from, nothing.

633
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,960
Excuse me.

634
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:29,029
Special Agent Bishop.

635
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,900
Listen.

636
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:36,103
The doctor says I'm supposed
to be sleeping, but...

637
00:26:36,172 --> 00:26:37,905
I can't.

638
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:39,473
You think we're
gonna get this guy?

639
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:41,875
Yeah, we I.D.'d him.
18-year-old kid.

640
00:26:41,944 --> 00:26:43,477
Evan Sykes.

641
00:26:43,546 --> 00:26:46,280
Eighteen.

642
00:26:46,348 --> 00:26:47,881
Hey.

643
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,183
We're gonna get him.

644
00:26:51,387 --> 00:26:53,287
The minute I woke up...

645
00:26:53,355 --> 00:26:55,622
I had to laugh, you
know what I mean?

646
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:59,026
It's like some
bad joke.

647
00:26:59,094 --> 00:27:01,295
I'm out there putting my
ass on the line every day,

648
00:27:01,363 --> 00:27:03,297
and then this
happens when I'm

649
00:27:03,365 --> 00:27:05,332
bringing my wife
pancakes on my day off.

650
00:27:07,636 --> 00:27:09,236
But damn...

651
00:27:09,305 --> 00:27:12,639
you got to laugh,
because otherwise...

652
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:13,941
Your wife a patient?

653
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:15,642
No, she works
at the hospital.

654
00:27:15,711 --> 00:27:17,678
- Yeah? What floor?
- The third.

655
00:27:19,248 --> 00:27:20,747
Gibbs.

656
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:25,452
Security at
the skating rink

657
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:26,798
spotted a man
in Marine utilities.

658
00:27:26,822 --> 00:27:28,188
He's loitering
in the parking lot

659
00:27:28,257 --> 00:27:29,690
carrying a black bag.

660
00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:35,596
Hey, back in the car,
back in the car.

661
00:27:40,436 --> 00:27:41,869
We got him.

662
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:46,607
NCIS!
Drop the bag!

663
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:50,277
Okay, okay, okay.
Don't shoot.

664
00:27:51,614 --> 00:27:53,013
I didn't do anything.

665
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,849
Lose the cover.

666
00:27:55,918 --> 00:27:57,518
Damn it, let me see your eyes.

667
00:27:58,754 --> 00:28:01,221
It's not him.

668
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,357
He's not even
a Marine.

669
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:04,691
Bag is clear.
I was just waiting

670
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,937
for my buddy to
get out of hockey

671
00:28:05,961 --> 00:28:07,060
so we could go
to the gym.

672
00:28:08,097 --> 00:28:09,396
Get out of here.

673
00:28:11,634 --> 00:28:13,066
Go on.

674
00:28:14,637 --> 00:28:16,036
He keeps dressing like a Marine,

675
00:28:16,105 --> 00:28:18,539
Evan Sykes could be anyone
in this town.

676
00:28:18,607 --> 00:28:21,308
Father have any idea
where he might be?

677
00:28:21,377 --> 00:28:22,309
None.

678
00:28:22,378 --> 00:28:23,378
So we've got nothing.

679
00:28:23,445 --> 00:28:24,645
I got something.

680
00:28:24,713 --> 00:28:26,613
Pancakes.

681
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:44,031
What are you doing here?
Faith,

682
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:45,866
listen, I know that
you declined protection,

683
00:28:45,935 --> 00:28:47,834
but after learning more
about the shooter,

684
00:28:47,903 --> 00:28:49,403
I strongly advise you

685
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:50,904
to err on the
side of caution.

686
00:28:50,973 --> 00:28:52,606
Unbelievable.

687
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:55,742
Uh, I'm sorry.

688
00:28:57,346 --> 00:28:59,746
I'm just giving you
my honest professional opinion.

689
00:28:59,815 --> 00:29:01,848
Oh, oh, really, is that
what you're doing?

690
00:29:01,917 --> 00:29:04,952
How do you think I felt when I
saw you walk in that room today?

691
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,420
What? What are you...

692
00:29:07,756 --> 00:29:10,090
You think I don't
know who you are?

693
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,391
I know.

694
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,760
Okay? I've known for years.

695
00:29:13,829 --> 00:29:16,430
You're not that hard
to find online.

696
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,702
You know, you're the one that
said you didn't want to know.

697
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:25,238
But I guess you looked
me up, too, didn't you?

698
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:27,641
- Yes, I did.
- Why?

699
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,043
The day I was born,
you handed me to my mom,

700
00:29:30,112 --> 00:29:32,112
and you told her that
you never wanted

701
00:29:32,181 --> 00:29:34,414
to have anything to
do with me again.

702
00:29:34,483 --> 00:29:36,078
It wasn't as simple as that.

703
00:29:36,102 --> 00:29:37,452
Oh, no, no, right.
I forgot the part

704
00:29:37,453 --> 00:29:38,986
where you went on with your life

705
00:29:39,054 --> 00:29:41,555
and made something great
of yourself.

706
00:29:41,624 --> 00:29:44,124
You know what?
You made your choice.

707
00:29:44,193 --> 00:29:47,761
You don't get to show up
at my door now

708
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,730
and pretend that you care.

709
00:29:52,234 --> 00:29:54,501
You don't get
to change your mind.

710
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,570
- Faith, please don't do this.
- No.

711
00:29:56,639 --> 00:29:58,071
This is the one
thing you taught me:

712
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,241
how to walk away
without looking back.

713
00:30:16,245 --> 00:30:18,946
Gibbs. Rumor has it that
we're pumping all our resources

714
00:30:19,015 --> 00:30:21,706
into a hunch of yours
regarding pancakes?

715
00:30:21,707 --> 00:30:22,839
Well, when Gibbs' gut

716
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,873
gets to churnin', the
perps will be burnin'.

717
00:30:27,211 --> 00:30:29,111
Sorry, I usually just
say that in my head.

718
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:30,290
The morning of
the shooting,

719
00:30:30,314 --> 00:30:32,614
Officer Moseby was
at the hospital

720
00:30:32,683 --> 00:30:34,082
bringing pancakes
to his wife.

721
00:30:34,151 --> 00:30:35,918
She works on
the third floor.

722
00:30:35,986 --> 00:30:37,753
They ate together in
the same break room

723
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:39,388
that Evan Sykes
was seen exiting.

724
00:30:39,456 --> 00:30:40,956
Officer Moseby
also plays

725
00:30:41,025 --> 00:30:42,891
on a rec hockey team
at the Ice Station,

726
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,994
and he drops his kids off
at Willow Den three days a week.

727
00:30:46,063 --> 00:30:48,397
Evan Sykes wasn't looking
for drugs in that break room.

728
00:30:48,465 --> 00:30:49,798
He was looking for Moseby.

729
00:30:49,867 --> 00:30:53,569
This was a targeted hit
disguised as a mass shooting.

730
00:30:53,637 --> 00:30:57,339
What better way to hide
your motive than to make

731
00:30:57,408 --> 00:30:59,007
the target appear
to be random.

732
00:30:59,076 --> 00:31:00,576
All right. Thanks.

733
00:31:00,644 --> 00:31:02,311
Officer Moseby is safe.

734
00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:04,346
We have three agents
outside his hospital room.

735
00:31:04,415 --> 00:31:06,181
- Do we have a motive?
- Working on it.

736
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,483
I did some digging into
Evan's brother Christopher.

737
00:31:08,552 --> 00:31:11,520
It turns out he's up for
parole next month, and guess

738
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:15,157
who always does a victims impact
statement at his hearings.

739
00:31:15,225 --> 00:31:17,092
Moseby.

740
00:31:17,161 --> 00:31:17,899
Why would he do that?

741
00:31:17,923 --> 00:31:19,662
Because he was
the first responder

742
00:31:19,663 --> 00:31:22,431
at Christopher's drunk
driving accident.

743
00:31:22,499 --> 00:31:24,266
Moseby speaks for
the family that died

744
00:31:24,335 --> 00:31:25,979
because they're not here
to speak for themselves.

745
00:31:26,003 --> 00:31:27,847
And by killing that voice,
Evan thought his brother

746
00:31:27,871 --> 00:31:29,516
might stand a better chance
of being released.

747
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,473
Yeah.

748
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:34,109
Wait, if Moseby knew
all of this, wouldn't he think

749
00:31:34,178 --> 00:31:36,211
something was up
when he heard the name Sykes?

750
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,800
No, because Christopher goes by
a different last name, Thompson.

751
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:41,950
But last names aside,
Evan Sykes is still out there.

752
00:31:46,724 --> 00:31:48,190
Boss?

753
00:31:48,258 --> 00:31:49,391
Directive hasn't changed.

754
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,393
Get me a location on Evan Sykes.

755
00:31:53,697 --> 00:31:55,464
- Jack.
- Gibbs,

756
00:31:55,532 --> 00:31:56,732
good timing.

757
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,333
Want you to take a look
at some stuff.

758
00:31:58,402 --> 00:31:59,768
Faith Tolliver just called.

759
00:32:00,871 --> 00:32:02,204
She changed her mind about

760
00:32:02,272 --> 00:32:03,872
having an agent
outside her place.

761
00:32:03,941 --> 00:32:06,341
She did? That-that's great.

762
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:09,911
She requested that this time,
it not be you.

763
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,481
Uh-huh.

764
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:13,715
I'm starting to think you had

765
00:32:13,784 --> 00:32:15,384
the right idea,
recusing yourself.

766
00:32:15,452 --> 00:32:19,321
Oh, I'm not recusing myself,
Gibbs. I can't.

767
00:32:20,658 --> 00:32:22,224
I'm in this.

768
00:32:24,128 --> 00:32:25,427
Here.

769
00:32:25,496 --> 00:32:28,030
Take a look at this.

770
00:32:28,065 --> 00:32:31,199
Okay. Evan Sykes.

771
00:32:31,268 --> 00:32:34,169
He is a scared, lost kid.

772
00:32:34,238 --> 00:32:36,538
He likely has no idea
what to do next.

773
00:32:36,607 --> 00:32:38,206
Read this at your leisure,

774
00:32:38,275 --> 00:32:41,710
because this is the profile
that's really gonna help you.

775
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:43,378
Noah Sykes.

776
00:32:43,447 --> 00:32:45,580
He worked three jobs to
get his son the best lawyer

777
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:47,949
he could for that
drunk driving trial.

778
00:32:48,018 --> 00:32:49,685
And after one son
went to prison,

779
00:32:49,753 --> 00:32:53,622
Noah did everything in his power
to help the other one move on.

780
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:55,891
Evan was taunted in school,

781
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:59,027
so he moved him
to the next town over.

782
00:32:59,096 --> 00:33:02,030
He even changed
their last name.

783
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:04,966
What does that mean, Jack?

784
00:33:05,035 --> 00:33:08,603
It means he's
the kind of parent

785
00:33:08,672 --> 00:33:13,041
that loves and protects
to the end, no matter what.

786
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,544
He knows where Evan is.

787
00:33:15,612 --> 00:33:18,146
I would bet my life on it.

788
00:33:18,215 --> 00:33:20,482
But you need to tell him
something, Gibbs.

789
00:33:21,985 --> 00:33:24,219
You need to tell him
that in this situation,

790
00:33:24,288 --> 00:33:27,155
<i>there is only one way</i>
<i>to truly protect his son.</i>

791
00:33:27,224 --> 00:33:29,658
Room 124.

792
00:33:40,337 --> 00:33:42,070
Room 124.

793
00:33:42,139 --> 00:33:44,005
He's alone.

794
00:33:44,074 --> 00:33:45,652
- I'll get the father out of here.
- Yeah.

795
00:33:45,676 --> 00:33:47,309
Wait.

796
00:33:48,812 --> 00:33:51,079
We can't let this kid off easy.

797
00:33:51,148 --> 00:33:53,882
Easy for him is dead.

798
00:34:02,192 --> 00:34:03,859
Yeah?

799
00:34:03,927 --> 00:34:06,061
Good? Go.

800
00:34:12,536 --> 00:34:14,102
All right, on your go, boss.

801
00:34:14,171 --> 00:34:15,604
No. Torres goes in alone.

802
00:34:15,672 --> 00:34:16,772
Gibbs?

803
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,874
You got this?

804
00:34:18,942 --> 00:34:21,376
- Yeah.
- Go.

805
00:34:31,522 --> 00:34:32,687
NCIS!

806
00:34:36,026 --> 00:34:38,059
All right, kid,

807
00:34:38,128 --> 00:34:39,628
I'll make you a deal.

808
00:34:39,696 --> 00:34:42,364
You reach, and I shoot.

809
00:34:42,432 --> 00:34:43,999
I just wanted my brother back.

810
00:34:44,067 --> 00:34:45,400
Yeah, well,

811
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:47,102
Officer Moseby survived.

812
00:34:48,305 --> 00:34:50,372
But what about Diana Sanchez?

813
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,207
Who?

814
00:34:52,276 --> 00:34:54,042
She is the woman
you killed, Evan.

815
00:34:54,111 --> 00:34:56,812
Hey, tell me
something.

816
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,482
Was shooting all those people
just a cover-up for your motive?

817
00:35:00,551 --> 00:35:02,851
Or was it your cry for help?

818
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,219
Or was it just a bonus?

819
00:35:04,288 --> 00:35:06,655
'Cause, see,

820
00:35:06,723 --> 00:35:09,157
what gets under my skin
is that there was no reason,

821
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:11,359
but there was a reason.

822
00:35:11,428 --> 00:35:13,061
You had a reason,
didn't you?

823
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,498
You didn't have the power
to save your brother...

824
00:35:18,001 --> 00:35:20,502
...so in the hospital,

825
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:23,738
you took the power
over everything.

826
00:35:25,509 --> 00:35:27,843
But, man...

827
00:35:29,913 --> 00:35:32,280
...I don't accept that reason.

828
00:35:40,123 --> 00:35:43,058
Pick it up, Evan.

829
00:35:43,126 --> 00:35:45,760
- Pick up the gun!
- I'm sorry! Don't shoot!

830
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:46,962
Don't shoot.

831
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:50,365
Please don't shoot.

832
00:35:50,434 --> 00:35:51,933
I'm sorry.

833
00:35:52,002 --> 00:35:53,768
That's not enough.

834
00:35:55,339 --> 00:35:57,205
Gibbs!

835
00:36:01,044 --> 00:36:03,278
All right, get your
hands behind your back.

836
00:36:14,858 --> 00:36:16,725
I'm sorry.

837
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,570
Faith.

838
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:31,573
Look, I know
Evan Sykes is in custody.

839
00:36:31,642 --> 00:36:33,241
They-they already told me.

840
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,843
Yeah.

841
00:36:34,912 --> 00:36:36,344
Please.

842
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:45,820
Okay. What is it you want
to say, Agent Sloane?

843
00:36:47,257 --> 00:36:51,092
I need you to know,
the day you were born,

844
00:36:51,161 --> 00:36:55,463
I did give you to your mother

845
00:36:55,532 --> 00:36:57,866
and told her
that I had to cut all ties.

846
00:36:57,935 --> 00:37:00,335
But it wasn't because
I didn't love you.

847
00:37:00,404 --> 00:37:02,470
I, um...

848
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:04,973
I just knew that,
if I saw you again,

849
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:07,475
I wouldn't be able
to let you go.

850
00:37:07,544 --> 00:37:09,878
But I had to.
I had to let you go,

851
00:37:09,947 --> 00:37:11,947
because I was, uh...

852
00:37:15,852 --> 00:37:17,619
I'm sorry
I can't explain it right now,

853
00:37:17,688 --> 00:37:19,387
but I will, one day.

854
00:37:19,456 --> 00:37:22,057
There is no "one day."

855
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:24,459
Not for us.

856
00:37:34,805 --> 00:37:37,505
If you didn't want to see me,

857
00:37:37,574 --> 00:37:39,641
why did you risk it?

858
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,309
What?

859
00:37:41,378 --> 00:37:43,745
You were in
California.

860
00:37:43,814 --> 00:37:46,214
You knew that moving here meant

861
00:37:46,283 --> 00:37:48,650
you might walk into a room
one day

862
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:51,820
and I would be sitting there.

863
00:37:51,888 --> 00:37:54,823
Why didn't you just stay
where you were?

864
00:37:54,891 --> 00:37:58,593
Because I failed.

865
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:03,765
I tried every which way
to let you go, but I...

866
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:06,001
can't, so...

867
00:38:54,718 --> 00:38:57,652
Boss, you knew how on edge

868
00:38:57,721 --> 00:39:00,422
Torres was about
this mass shooting.

869
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,824
But you sent him in there alone.

870
00:39:02,893 --> 00:39:05,660
Guess you knew that...
raw kind of anger

871
00:39:05,729 --> 00:39:08,329
would scare Evan into
giving himself up.

872
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,901
You knew Torres wasn't gonna
pull that trigger, right?

873
00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:16,471
There are no absolutes, Tim.

874
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,173
Boss, you okay?

875
00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:21,409
I got one with a swan.

876
00:39:21,478 --> 00:39:23,478
I got one with a kid.

877
00:39:23,547 --> 00:39:25,580
I got one with a plant.

878
00:39:25,649 --> 00:39:27,649
"One with a kid."
You talking about Jimmy?

879
00:39:27,717 --> 00:39:30,652
I wanted to shake 'em all.

880
00:39:30,754 --> 00:39:33,955
I wanted to say, "Rule 10."

881
00:39:34,024 --> 00:39:35,423
Yeah, but you didn't.

882
00:39:37,427 --> 00:39:39,527
I couldn't.

883
00:39:39,596 --> 00:39:42,197
I burned Rule 10.

884
00:39:46,169 --> 00:39:48,703
No going back.

885
00:39:48,772 --> 00:39:52,207
Worked out okay today, but...

886
00:39:52,275 --> 00:39:55,844
What, you burned "never get
personally involved on a case"?

887
00:39:55,912 --> 00:39:59,147
Hey, Tim, you've always had
your head on straight.

888
00:39:59,216 --> 00:40:01,182
You always have.

889
00:40:01,251 --> 00:40:02,717
Make sure to keep it that way.

890
00:40:02,786 --> 00:40:04,263
I don't understand.
You-you've never gotten rid

891
00:40:04,287 --> 00:40:05,520
of any of the rules.

892
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:07,455
I didn't do it for me.

893
00:40:10,026 --> 00:40:12,627
I'm not sure if it's right.

894
00:40:14,364 --> 00:40:17,198
Wow, you've... lived
with that rule a long time.

895
00:40:17,267 --> 00:40:20,702
Yeah. And I don't know where
I'm gonna end up without it.

896
00:40:37,954 --> 00:40:40,255
Nice to see some life in here.

897
00:40:43,226 --> 00:40:45,360
I thought you were
clearing the place out.

898
00:40:45,428 --> 00:40:47,162
Changed my mind.

899
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,997
Well, like I said,

900
00:40:49,065 --> 00:40:52,200
Ziva made one last payment
before her death, so...

901
00:40:52,269 --> 00:40:54,035
we're good through the end
of next year.

902
00:40:54,104 --> 00:40:55,436
But I do like
to know

903
00:40:55,505 --> 00:40:58,606
who I'll see coming and going.

904
00:40:58,675 --> 00:41:00,375
You'll be...

905
00:41:00,443 --> 00:41:02,577
working in here
from time to time?

906
00:41:02,646 --> 00:41:04,179
Maybe.

907
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:05,580
I hope so.

908
00:41:05,649 --> 00:41:09,350
Funny thing about hope--

909
00:41:09,419 --> 00:41:13,454
once she gets into your blood,
she never leaves you.

910
00:41:13,523 --> 00:41:14,856
Does she?

911
00:41:17,627 --> 00:41:20,628
I'll be seeing you, then.

912
00:41:40,062 --> 00:41:47,062
