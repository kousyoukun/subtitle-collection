1
00:00:07,992 --> 00:00:11,355
This is bad. What are Torres
and McGee supposed to do?

2
00:00:11,356 --> 00:00:14,291
- Tell the truth.
- Yeah, that's bad, right?

3
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:15,926
Hartgrave,
where is he?

4
00:00:15,994 --> 00:00:17,954
According to company security,
he just clocked in.

5
00:00:17,996 --> 00:00:20,630
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,400
Maybe it's not that bad.

7
00:00:23,469 --> 00:00:27,671
That's the United States
Secretary of Defense.

8
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,673
- Let's go.
- He's making house calls now?

9
00:00:31,076 --> 00:00:34,144
Yeah, it's bad.

10
00:00:35,714 --> 00:00:37,581
Gentlemen,

11
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:40,283
give me a minute.
Director Vance.

12
00:00:40,352 --> 00:00:41,751
Secretary Crawford.
I'd like to...

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,087
Not only did NCIS
disobey a direct order,

14
00:00:44,156 --> 00:00:46,823
you hacked classified
government records.

15
00:00:46,892 --> 00:00:48,358
Are these the
agents responsible?

16
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:51,628
I mean, is it hacking
if you had the password?

17
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:54,631
Weapons and badges, now.

18
00:00:58,403 --> 00:01:01,371
Director Vance, I'm shutting
down your investigation.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,207
And as for Special Agents

20
00:01:04,276 --> 00:01:07,878
McGee and Torres,

21
00:01:07,946 --> 00:01:09,946
you two are
going to prison.

22

24
00:01:43,382 --> 00:01:45,382
Leon, did NCIS
disobey my order?

25
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,841
Mr. Secretary, I'm playing
catch-up myself.

26
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:51,997
- Did your agents commit a crime?
- I agree it looks bad.

27
00:01:51,998 --> 00:01:53,423
Doesn't always mean
that there's a crime.

28
00:01:53,424 --> 00:01:55,402
- I'm not here for sad stories.
- You're here for answers.

29
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:57,104
A federal agency breaking
the law? I have to get

30
00:01:57,128 --> 00:01:58,705
ahead of this before
it breaks to national media.

31
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:00,462
Then let's make sure
we get it right.

32
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:01,730
We both want the truth.

33
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,399
Damn Skippy.
Are you suggesting

34
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:04,845
there's a perfectly
good reason for this?

35
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:06,202
I'm not saying a damn word,

36
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,803
but Agents McGee and Torres

37
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:09,238
will be happy
to explain,

38
00:02:09,307 --> 00:02:13,075
from the beginning,
in great detail.

39
00:02:13,144 --> 00:02:15,911
As if our necks depended on it?

40
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,179
Oh, they do, son.

41
00:02:17,248 --> 00:02:19,181
Nick, why don't
you start?

42
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,683
- What?
- Yeah.

43
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:23,352
- Why me?
- You were the one at the seminar.

44
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:25,061
Only because you made me go
in your place.

45
00:02:25,089 --> 00:02:27,256
Yeah, I had seniority.

46
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:30,259
Gentlemen, what seminar?

47
00:02:31,095 --> 00:02:32,895
"Optics In Law Enforcement."

48
00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:35,731
Two days ago at
the Freemont Inn.

49
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,167
So boring, am I right?

50
00:02:38,236 --> 00:02:39,535
That training was my idea.

51
00:02:39,604 --> 00:02:41,604
Mm...

52
00:02:42,673 --> 00:02:44,607
I mean, like,
boring...

53
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:47,343
at first...

54
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:50,946
This footage was taken
by a neighbor,

55
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:53,082
and after being posted
to social media,

56
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,851
some are now calling
FBI raid tactics into question.

57
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,921
Okay, before we discuss,
I'd like to thank

58
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,624
our media panelists
for joining us

59
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:05,227
on the first day
of our three-day seminar.

60
00:03:07,865 --> 00:03:11,467
Now, after watching
that news clip,

61
00:03:11,535 --> 00:03:15,204
can someone suggest
what we, as federal agents,

62
00:03:15,273 --> 00:03:16,739
could do better?

63
00:03:16,807 --> 00:03:18,540
For starters,
never call the FBI.

64
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:20,909
Anyone?

65
00:03:20,978 --> 00:03:22,778
This could relate
to any aspect

66
00:03:22,847 --> 00:03:23,979
of our job.
- Huh.

67
00:03:24,048 --> 00:03:27,816
That's, like, 40 texts
in less than two hours.

68
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:29,618
You've been counting?

69
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:31,220
There's nothing else to do

70
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:33,255
'cause I know all this.

71
00:03:33,324 --> 00:03:35,391
What I don't know is his name.

72
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,126
Whose name?

73
00:03:37,194 --> 00:03:39,228
Oh, the guy you're going
on a date tomorrow night.

74
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:43,766
All right, stop looking at
my screen, and his name is Boyd.

75
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:46,502
- He's still around?
- Yeah. It's date number five.

76
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,003
You're counting now?

77
00:03:48,072 --> 00:03:49,471
- Are you okay?
- I'm bored.

78
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,006
Mm-hmm.

79
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:53,008
Plus, we're not even
supposed to be here.

80
00:03:53,077 --> 00:03:55,944
Something you'd like to add,
Special Agent...

81
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:57,946
McGee?

82
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:03,152
Nah, I'm good.

83
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,354
I asked for all cell phones
to be turned off.

84
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:07,523
I am so sorry,
it belongs to Agent McGee.

85
00:04:07,591 --> 00:04:09,825
I keep telling him
that good police work

86
00:04:09,894 --> 00:04:12,094
starts with being
fully attentive.

87
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:13,762
Exactly. Thank you,

88
00:04:13,831 --> 00:04:16,332
Agent Gibbs.
- You are very welcome.

89
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,967
Oh. Oh, no,
it's my, it's my

90
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:21,337
daughter's school.
There's been an accident.

91
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:23,872
I-I'm sorry, I have to go.

92
00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:26,775
Oh, my word.
Will he be all right?

93
00:04:26,844 --> 00:04:28,410
You know what?
I don't really know.

94
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,879
I'm gonna go check.
I'm so sorry.

95
00:04:30,948 --> 00:04:34,350
Okay, back to the task at hand:

96
00:04:34,418 --> 00:04:37,119
optics in law enforcement.

97
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:44,960
Nice job, boss.

98
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:47,863
Yeah, you, too. The daughter
thing was a nice touch.

99
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:50,733
Hey, let me tell you something,
Gibbs and McGee owe us big time.

100
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:52,868
Okay, that's not exactly
how seniority works.

101
00:04:52,937 --> 00:04:55,037
Yeah, I can't take
two more days of this.

102
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:57,373
Ooh, sounds like a party.

103
00:04:57,441 --> 00:05:01,710
Yeah, Mrs. and Mr. Ned
and Charlene Clutterbuck.

104
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:03,379
I read it
when we came in.

105
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:05,714
A love story
for the ages.

106
00:05:05,783 --> 00:05:08,484
Yeah, like
Ellie and Boyd.

107
00:05:08,552 --> 00:05:13,188
Well, I'm starving. I wonder if
the Clutterbucks have a buffet.

108
00:05:13,257 --> 00:05:16,258
Let's find out. You can be the,
uh, the stylish distant cousin

109
00:05:16,327 --> 00:05:18,093
and I can be the
bad-boy boyfriend.

110
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:30,839
Hello? Everybody
okay in here?

111
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:32,007
Oh, my God, no!

112
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:35,444
Whoo, looks like
the bride and the groom

113
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:36,712
are getting an early start.

114
00:05:36,781 --> 00:05:39,014
Yeah, try the best man
and the maid of honor.

115
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,350
It doesn't matter, Phil.
I think he's dead.

116
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,051
Wha-- Okay, slow down.
Who-Who's dead?

117
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,498
Look, we didn't do
anything wrong, okay?

118
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:46,333
We just came in here
to get some peace and quiet.

119
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:47,689
Your pants are on backwards.

120
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:50,893
W-We bumped into a table
and I swear to God

121
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:53,195
a body fell off of it.
It's back there.

122
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:55,798
All right, look, why don't
you guys just wait outside?

123
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:57,010
- Yeah.
- I'll look for the lights.

124
00:05:57,034 --> 00:05:58,534
- Okay.
- Should we find a bathroom?

125
00:05:58,602 --> 00:06:00,035
I'm not in
the mood anymore.

126
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:04,206
It's freezing in here.

127
00:06:06,644 --> 00:06:09,812
Whoa. I got a body.

128
00:06:16,353 --> 00:06:19,221
Ugh. More like
a graveyard.

129
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,123
Yeah, this is the
wrong kind of buffet.

130
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:24,493
Yeah, I'm not so hungry anymore.

131
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:37,821
Don't wait for me.
Continue.

132
00:06:37,822 --> 00:06:39,766
Perhaps you'd like to me to put
the room in SCIF mode, sir,

133
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,970
so we won't
be disturbed.

134
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:42,849
No need, Leon. I was just
telling my people outside

135
00:06:42,873 --> 00:06:44,005
I won't be
much longer.

136
00:06:44,074 --> 00:06:45,841
I have yet to hear

137
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,676
anything that
changes my mind.

138
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:50,745
This might help.

139
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:56,351
Sit down, please.

140
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,854
Oh, no thanks,
I'd rather stand.

141
00:06:58,922 --> 00:07:01,356
It's better for circulation
and breathing.

142
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:03,525
- Wasn't an option. Sit down.
- What am I looking at?

143
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:06,027
It's a closed-circuit feed
from our interrogation room.

144
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:08,930
This suspect is the key
to an investigation

145
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:10,699
already in full swing.
- Who is he?

146
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:13,268
The man who will help us
prevent an act of terrorism.

147
00:07:13,337 --> 00:07:16,938
Terrorism?
You can prove that?

148
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:18,940
Agents McGee, Torres.

149
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:21,376
The bodies at the hotel.

150
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:23,044
Right.

151
00:07:23,113 --> 00:07:25,180
All right, keep clear.
You are all Federal agents.

152
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,882
You know how this works.
Everyone,

153
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,351
please make your way
back to the seminar.

154
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:32,621
Or stay and NCIS will show you
how it's done, baby.

155
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:34,389
Clearly your daughter's
feeling better.

156
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,458
Come on, people.

157
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:37,726
Making this a crime scene

158
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:39,794
was very premature,
Agent Gibbs.

159
00:07:39,863 --> 00:07:43,031
Your agents created chaos
for nothing.

160
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,367
- Doesn't look like nothing.
- This hotel

161
00:07:45,435 --> 00:07:49,037
operates with only the highest
standards and class.

162
00:07:49,106 --> 00:07:50,305
Richard!

163
00:07:50,374 --> 00:07:51,973
Um...

164
00:07:54,244 --> 00:07:56,211
I asked for this
nine minutes ago.

165
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,847
As you can see,

166
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,483
there's a medical conference
starting in here

167
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:02,484
tomorrow morning.

168
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:04,686
Oh, surgical robots?

169
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:07,889
The conference is sponsored
by the company that makes them.

170
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,591
The attendees
will be able

171
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,259
to test the robots right here.

172
00:08:11,328 --> 00:08:13,528
- On the bodies.
- Making them medical cadavers,

173
00:08:13,597 --> 00:08:15,430
not murder victims.

174
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:18,700
So can we wrap this up
before the media gets wind

175
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:22,170
and turns this into
some kind of Jonestown sequel?

176
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:25,006
Too late. Guy Ross
was already next door.

177
00:08:25,075 --> 00:08:27,275
He's looking
for an interview.

178
00:08:27,344 --> 00:08:30,178
There's nothing illegal here.

179
00:08:30,247 --> 00:08:34,049
These 20 medical cadavers
are completely legal.

180
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:35,784
We actually counted 21.

181
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:37,419
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

182
00:08:37,487 --> 00:08:38,954
Same here, 21 bodies.

183
00:08:39,022 --> 00:08:40,066
Oh, no, no, that's ridiculous.

184
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,790
No, no, no. I have the paperwork

185
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:43,892
right here,
Agent Gibbs.

186
00:08:43,961 --> 00:08:45,593
Clearly your people miscounted.

187
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:47,963
Or one of these bodies
doesn't belong.

188
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:49,297
We'll check.

189
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:56,204
Blackjack, also known as 21.

190
00:08:56,273 --> 00:08:59,307
21-gun salute.
21 is the gambling age.

191
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:02,243
It's also the drinking age,
and according to a study

192
00:09:02,312 --> 00:09:04,813
which is widely dismissed
by the medical community,

193
00:09:04,881 --> 00:09:09,384
the human soul weighs 21 grams.

194
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:11,753
Dr. Jim,
what do we know?

195
00:09:11,822 --> 00:09:13,788
21 was a culturally
significant number.

196
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:15,457
Significant for him.
You got an ID?

197
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:17,225
I just sent the
prints up to Kasie,

198
00:09:17,294 --> 00:09:19,728
but since this body was
the only body without a toe tag

199
00:09:19,796 --> 00:09:21,796
or any proper paperwork
for cadavers...

200
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:22,897
Not a cadaver.

201
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:25,967
Good thing NCIS
was there to count.

202
00:09:26,036 --> 00:09:28,603
This man did have
an internal core temperature

203
00:09:28,672 --> 00:09:30,071
of 75 degrees.

204
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,607
- So his time of death was recent.
- Yeah, last night-ish.

205
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:34,909
There's no obvious signs
of a cause of death,

206
00:09:34,978 --> 00:09:36,845
though there's some
slight discoloration

207
00:09:36,913 --> 00:09:39,080
in his eyes, as well
as his nose, throat.

208
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:40,482
Breathed
something bad?

209
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,417
Maybe. He certainly
didn't die of old age.

210
00:09:42,486 --> 00:09:43,918
I'd put him in his late 20s.

211
00:09:43,987 --> 00:09:45,253
Any scars, any markings?

212
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:47,489
No, no, nothing
outwardly identifying,

213
00:09:47,557 --> 00:09:51,760
which is why we must
look inward.

214
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:53,962
Might want to step back.

215
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:56,865
That has to be wrong
because there are no laws

216
00:09:56,933 --> 00:09:58,767
against bodies
in ballrooms.

217
00:09:58,835 --> 00:10:01,269
Apparently, it's a thing. Read.

218
00:10:01,338 --> 00:10:03,538
There are many laws
about unregistered cadavers.

219
00:10:05,342 --> 00:10:06,708
So where did
this guy come from?

220
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:10,512
I'm hopefully about to find out.

221
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:24,192
Oh. Oh, that's odd.

222
00:10:24,261 --> 00:10:26,728
- What're we looking at?
- A body without lungs.

223
00:10:26,797 --> 00:10:29,330
They have completely...

224
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:32,867
disintegrated.

225
00:10:34,738 --> 00:10:36,671
<i>Whoa, whoa. Hold up.</i>

226
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,641
So you did cancel Bishop's date
without asking?

227
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:43,778
No, I just, all I said was,
uh, uh, "Sorry, work stuff,"

228
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:46,247
because, you know, she was
too busy working to reply.

229
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:47,682
Sounds like you cancelled.

230
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:48,895
Maybe we're getting off topic?

231
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,096
And you're running out of time.

232
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,397
My phone's gonna
ring, telling me

233
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:52,565
the press conference
is about to start.

234
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:53,755
Press conference?

235
00:10:53,824 --> 00:10:55,757
Two NCIS agents
are being arrested.

236
00:10:55,826 --> 00:10:57,425
I have to get ahead of this.

237
00:10:57,494 --> 00:10:59,561
So I suggest someone
get to the damn point.

238
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:00,862
That'd be Tim.

239
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:02,030
I wasn't in autopsy,

240
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:03,565
but I was in the bullpen later

241
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:06,201
when our forensic scientist
came in with news.

242
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:07,569
Hey.

243
00:11:07,637 --> 00:11:08,770
- Hey.
- Whoa.

244
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,405
- When did this get here?
- Oh.

245
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:13,007
Uh, mail cart just came by.
What did you order this time?

246
00:11:13,076 --> 00:11:14,320
What, are you kidding?
I can't afford anything

247
00:11:14,344 --> 00:11:15,710
from Splendifida.

248
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,012
But they do make nice stuff.

249
00:11:18,081 --> 00:11:19,848
You're sure
you didn't gadget splurge?

250
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,616
Maybe in your sleep?

251
00:11:21,685 --> 00:11:24,552
No, Delilah blocked all credit
card access after 11:30 p.m.

252
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:26,921
It is addressed to me. Weird.

253
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,123
Stop the presses.

254
00:11:28,191 --> 00:11:29,224
Hold the phone.

255
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:30,425
And the horses.

256
00:11:30,494 --> 00:11:31,893
I just got the
results back

257
00:11:31,962 --> 00:11:33,795
from our body in autopsy,

258
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:36,364
and we have traveled
back in time.

259
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:38,032
- Is that good or bad?
- Bad.

260
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:39,968
Have you ever watched
a science-fiction movie?

261
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:43,738
The space-time continuum
should never be disrupted.

262
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:44,807
You got a cause of death.

263
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:47,275
Set the wayback machine
for World War I.

264
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:50,211
The lungs in our mystery
body have disintegrated

265
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,715
from exposure to toxic
chlorine gas.

266
00:11:53,783 --> 00:11:56,784
The kind banned by the Geneva
Convention as a war crime.

267
00:11:56,853 --> 00:11:58,453
Victim
was killed

268
00:11:58,522 --> 00:11:59,954
by a chemical weapon.

269
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:02,957
Time travel is always bad.

270
00:12:10,257 --> 00:12:12,023
- Heads up.
- Oh.

271
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:14,025
Okay.
Chlorine gas. That's bad.

272
00:12:14,094 --> 00:12:16,139
But I already knew about
this one victim. And, so far,

273
00:12:16,163 --> 00:12:17,696
I haven't seen
any evidence to suggest

274
00:12:17,764 --> 00:12:19,264
a greater threat of terrorism.

275
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,099
We know about the missing gas.

276
00:12:21,168 --> 00:12:22,934
I'm sorry?

277
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:25,637
The missing batch
of chemical weapons?

278
00:12:25,706 --> 00:12:27,973
Enough to poison an
entire city block.

279
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,307
What are they talking about?

280
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:31,543
"A greater threat of terrorism."

281
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:33,445
We had
a mystery dead body

282
00:12:33,513 --> 00:12:35,947
killed by chlorine gas.
That's bad.

283
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:38,483
But we didn't know how bad
until Kasie came in

284
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:42,554
and, well, gave
a very moving presentation.

285
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,458
I, uh, I'm gonna need a minute
before my presentation.

286
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:48,493
You okay?

287
00:12:48,562 --> 00:12:51,129
Totally. Just, uh, need a beat.

288
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:54,366
- Hmm.
- Yeah, dude. What is all this stuff?

289
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:58,870
Drones, VR goggles,
oh, check this out.

290
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:00,383
This is from their
winter style catalogue.

291
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:01,840
It's a wristwatch.

292
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:04,075
It's got a hidden camera
and a hidden knife.

293
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:05,977
- A hidden knife?
- Yeah.

294
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:08,546
Whoa.

295
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:10,548
- I like hidden knives.
- Yeah.

296
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:12,017
Was all this stuff free?

297
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:14,419
You know, I e-mailed
the company last month.

298
00:13:14,488 --> 00:13:17,422
It must be because I pointed
some, uh, U.I. glitches

299
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:20,258
and software bugs
on my new robotic dog.

300
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:22,927
It's a Christmas
gift for the twins.

301
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:24,829
Yeah, of course.

302
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:27,098
Okay, I'm ready.

303
00:13:29,503 --> 00:13:34,239
Chlorine gas was developed
in 1915 by Fritz Haber.

304
00:13:34,307 --> 00:13:35,840
It was mainly
to get around a treaty

305
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:37,676
prohibiting the use
of projectiles.

306
00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:40,045
Chlorine hovers at ground level

307
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:43,248
in yellow-green clouds that
smell like pineapple and pepper.

308
00:13:43,316 --> 00:13:44,716
And melt lungs.

309
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:46,518
Pure evil, really.
So, of course,

310
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:49,721
the U.S. and Russia developed
tons of it during the Cold War.

311
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,790
You know, humans can
really suck sometimes.

312
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:53,625
Which is why we have diplomacy.

313
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:56,695
Chemical weapons have since
been banned. Peace on Earth.

314
00:13:56,763 --> 00:13:58,096
So if chemicals
have been banned,

315
00:13:58,165 --> 00:14:00,598
how did our dead guy get dead?

316
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,400
Because they haven't
all been destroyed yet.

317
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:05,570
Destruction is expensive
and slow.

318
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,872
The U.S. stockpile won't be
eliminated until 2023,

319
00:14:07,941 --> 00:14:11,710
at a cost of around $50 billion.

320
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:14,779
- But that's not the depressing part.
- It's not?

321
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:17,115
Chemical weapons
are still in use.

322
00:14:17,184 --> 00:14:19,150
A U.N. report condemned
the Syrian government

323
00:14:19,219 --> 00:14:22,821
for dropping chlorine bombs
on its own people last year,

324
00:14:22,923 --> 00:14:26,057
including civilians
and children.

325
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:30,261
I can't imagine.

326
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,764
Can we talk about
something happier?

327
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,467
Oh.

328
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:41,639
Oh, yay. Fingerprints came back

329
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,075
on our grossly
disfigured mystery body.

330
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:47,345
So much for happier.

331
00:14:47,414 --> 00:14:50,615
I can't believe Keenan's dead.

332
00:14:50,684 --> 00:14:52,183
Miss Grant,
uh, when was

333
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:53,852
the last time you
spoke to your brother?

334
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,487
Last week.

335
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:57,500
Keenan was the only one
in our family who was actually

336
00:14:57,524 --> 00:14:58,790
on his way to making good,

337
00:14:58,859 --> 00:15:00,525
and now he got
his stupid ass killed.

338
00:15:00,594 --> 00:15:02,627
- You blame your brother.
- You're damn right I do.

339
00:15:03,573 --> 00:15:07,866
After Mom died, he promised me
he wouldn't leave me alone.

340
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:10,268
We'd like to ask you
a few questions

341
00:15:10,337 --> 00:15:12,270
about his job at, uh...

342
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:13,339
He worked two jobs.

343
00:15:13,373 --> 00:15:15,039
He was a busboy

344
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:16,828
at the hellhole I cook at,
but the other one

345
00:15:16,877 --> 00:15:19,210
was a good job
at a nice company.

346
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,147
Trine Chemical Agent
Destruction Plant.

347
00:15:22,215 --> 00:15:23,893
Keenan was
the only one in our family

348
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:26,284
who could actually pass
the required background check.

349
00:15:26,353 --> 00:15:28,553
He never had a criminal record.

350
00:15:28,622 --> 00:15:32,357
We think that his job might have
something to do with his death.

351
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:34,670
- He was driving trucks for them.
- He ever mention chlorine?

352
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:36,572
Did his job include
handling anything dangerous?

353
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:39,030
If you want to know about
chemicals, talk to the company.

354
00:15:39,099 --> 00:15:40,999
We are. But...

355
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:42,834
Keenan didn't
screw up.

356
00:15:44,471 --> 00:15:47,839
I get to blame my baby brother.
You don't.

357
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:52,010
<i>This place is like Fort Knox.</i>

358
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:54,412
Well, chemicals can be
just as valuable as gold.

359
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:56,347
Certainly more dangerous.

360
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,584
I wonder who's watching.
See there?

361
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:01,386
Hi. Excuse me.

362
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:03,254
You must be NCIS.

363
00:16:03,323 --> 00:16:06,591
My apologies for being so late.
I was all the way across campus.

364
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,893
And, uh, they give us
these golf carts,

365
00:16:08,962 --> 00:16:12,530
but why waste the energy, right?
Dr. Patton Hartgrave.

366
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:14,833
Hi. Trine's lead
chemical engineer.

367
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:16,434
So...

368
00:16:16,503 --> 00:16:17,936
Excuse me.

369
00:16:18,004 --> 00:16:19,904
If you, uh, aren't afraid
to look too dorky,

370
00:16:19,973 --> 00:16:21,372
I could show you around.

371
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:24,008
It's impossible for
me to look dorky.

372
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:26,444
Right.

373
00:16:26,513 --> 00:16:29,914
So this is
where the magic happens.

374
00:16:29,983 --> 00:16:34,052
We dispose of harmful chemicals
two ways: incineration

375
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,888
and neutralization,
mixing in other agents

376
00:16:36,957 --> 00:16:38,723
to eliminate toxicity.

377
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:41,759
It's all very
effective, very safe.

378
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:43,628
Which means it's very expensive.

379
00:16:43,697 --> 00:16:46,264
Well, I can assure you
it's worth every penny.

380
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,466
Where did Keenan Grant work?

381
00:16:50,203 --> 00:16:52,136
Right.

382
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:55,540
This is, uh...
this is Mr. Grant's locker.

383
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:58,376
I didn't know him personally,

384
00:16:58,445 --> 00:17:00,812
but of course, we're all very
shocked to hear what happened.

385
00:17:00,881 --> 00:17:02,580
Was he working two nights ago?

386
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:04,482
Uh, let's see.

387
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:09,554
Actually, I have access
to those records.

388
00:17:09,623 --> 00:17:12,323
Mm...

389
00:17:12,392 --> 00:17:16,327
Uh, yes. It looks like he
was working that night.

390
00:17:16,396 --> 00:17:19,764
It was a single pickup at
the Freemont Inn in D.C.

391
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,299
That's where his body was found.

392
00:17:21,368 --> 00:17:23,568
What was he picking up?

393
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:26,070
Some industrial plastic
for recycling.

394
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:27,672
It's nothing too dangerous.

395
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:31,075
It's hotel waste,
not Chernobyl, which...

396
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:34,646
was an ecological warning sign
nobody took seriously enough.

397
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:36,748
You seem very, uh,
Earth-friendly

398
00:17:36,816 --> 00:17:38,483
for a chemical guy.

399
00:17:38,551 --> 00:17:42,420
Hey, I'm just correcting some
of mankind's worst mistakes.

400
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:44,122
Like destroying chlorine gas.

401
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,491
That's impossible.

402
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,862
Oh, uh, Agents McGee and Torres,
this is George Ashley Green,

403
00:17:50,931 --> 00:17:52,497
our fearless leader.

404
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:55,133
Well, CEO
of Trine Chemical, anyway.

405
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:57,001
I happened to see
you two come in.

406
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,636
I knew somebody was watching.

407
00:17:58,705 --> 00:18:00,625
Why is destroying
chlorine gas impossible?

408
00:18:00,674 --> 00:18:03,775
Because we haven't
had any for years.

409
00:18:03,843 --> 00:18:05,877
It was all destroyed
per previous

410
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:07,045
military contracts.

411
00:18:07,113 --> 00:18:08,157
What about current contracts?

412
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:09,948
None, for chlorine.

413
00:18:10,016 --> 00:18:12,951
But that's all I can really say
without clearance.

414
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:14,552
National security concerns.

415
00:18:14,621 --> 00:18:15,987
You understand.

416
00:18:16,056 --> 00:18:17,555
I need permission
from the Pentagon.

417
00:18:22,295 --> 00:18:23,561
Hey, Bishop. Go.

418
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,941
The DoD is pushing

419
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:27,131
your meeting time, again.

420
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,466
Actually, they cancelled

421
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:30,068
and suggested
you come back tomorrow.

422
00:18:30,136 --> 00:18:31,803
Oh, no. No, no, no.

423
00:18:31,871 --> 00:18:33,805
I'm not going anywhere
until I get some answers.

424
00:18:33,873 --> 00:18:35,551
That's what I told them,
but they kept citing

425
00:18:35,575 --> 00:18:38,676
"national security concerns"
without any details.

426
00:18:38,745 --> 00:18:40,378
Uh, Bishop?

427
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:42,714
I'll call you back.

428
00:18:43,984 --> 00:18:45,750
Good afternoon.

429
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:47,085
Special Agent Gibbs, right?

430
00:18:47,153 --> 00:18:48,820
Wynn Crawford.

431
00:18:48,888 --> 00:18:50,021
- Yes, sir.
- I just got done

432
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,223
talking about
your team with SECNAV.

433
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:55,026
She had quite a few stories
about you, all good.

434
00:18:55,095 --> 00:18:57,028
- I'll bet.
- About your meeting...

435
00:18:57,097 --> 00:18:58,596
- Uh, it was cancelled.
- By me.

436
00:18:58,665 --> 00:18:59,945
But since you're here, I figured

437
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,310
I'd give you
the bad news in person.

438
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:03,401
Pentagon records have been
temporarily locked.

439
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,636
- By you.
- No, by State.

440
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:07,216
They're currently working
with the U.N.

441
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,073
on a cease-fire agreement
in Syria.

442
00:19:09,142 --> 00:19:11,542
Your requests sent up red flags.

443
00:19:11,611 --> 00:19:14,412
Chemical weapons investigations
make people nervous.

444
00:19:14,481 --> 00:19:16,047
So do chemical attacks.

445
00:19:16,116 --> 00:19:17,749
Yeah, see, that's exactly

446
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:20,184
the kind of reckless talk
that we can't afford.

447
00:19:20,253 --> 00:19:21,519
Now, do you have proof

448
00:19:21,588 --> 00:19:22,588
of intended terrorism?

449
00:19:22,655 --> 00:19:24,022
Or missing weapons?

450
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,590
You're making it hard
to find proof.

451
00:19:25,658 --> 00:19:27,737
Well, find a different way,
and I'll be happy to help.

452
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:30,228
I want justice
for your victim.

453
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:32,063
But Marine to Marine?

454
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:35,233
There are a lot bigger things
at play here on the world stage.

455
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:37,435
We can do both, Mr. Secretary.

456
00:19:37,504 --> 00:19:40,872
This was a courtesy,
not a negotiation.

457
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,774
Now, unless NCIS

458
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:47,745
has concrete evidence of missing
weapons-- actual weapons--

459
00:19:47,814 --> 00:19:49,580
you will stand down.

460
00:19:51,217 --> 00:19:53,151
That's an order.

461
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,661
So, Gibbs told you
about my order

462
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,164
to stand down, and you
still failed to follow it.

463
00:20:06,232 --> 00:20:09,000
I don't always agree
with Gibbs myself, sir,

464
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:10,935
but I do trust his judgment,

465
00:20:11,004 --> 00:20:13,738
and the judgment
of my people here at NCIS.

466
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:14,784
If they didn't follow your
order, it's because

467
00:20:14,808 --> 00:20:16,441
there are missing weapons.

468
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:18,776
And the chemical engineer
sitting in interrogation...

469
00:20:18,845 --> 00:20:20,812
- Can tell us everything?
- Keep watching.

470
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,413
My people know how
to break this guy.

471
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:24,282
I'm not saying a word,

472
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,616
so just arrest me
or be done.

473
00:20:25,685 --> 00:20:26,851
I'm sorry,

474
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,286
are we keeping you
from something?

475
00:20:28,354 --> 00:20:29,687
Hot date, maybe?

476
00:20:36,763 --> 00:20:38,763
Oh, God!

477
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:41,866
Cat's out of the bag.

478
00:20:41,935 --> 00:20:45,169
Guess you could say
my hot date's with Mother Earth.

479
00:20:45,238 --> 00:20:46,704
Six feet under.

480
00:20:46,773 --> 00:20:48,306
You were exposed to the gas.

481
00:20:48,374 --> 00:20:51,142
Not much, but enough.

482
00:20:53,246 --> 00:20:56,314
I'll be dead before
you can get me to talk.

483
00:20:56,382 --> 00:20:57,448
I'll get the kit.

484
00:20:57,517 --> 00:20:58,883
Sorry.

485
00:20:58,952 --> 00:21:01,018
Well, I guess NCIS is done here.

486
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:13,350
You need medical attention.

487
00:21:13,374 --> 00:21:14,607
We're calling the paramedics.

488
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:16,020
No, no, no,
it's too late for that.

489
00:21:16,044 --> 00:21:17,676
I told you I don't want that.

490
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:19,512
The fact that this man
is coughing up blood

491
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,147
means that we are right.

492
00:21:21,215 --> 00:21:23,449
Sir, there is missing
chlorine gas,

493
00:21:23,518 --> 00:21:24,850
and this man knows
where it is.

494
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:27,787
And you found this out how?

495
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:30,322
You seem to have forgotten
the part of the story

496
00:21:30,391 --> 00:21:32,031
where you two committed
a federal offense.

497
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,500
In fact, if I didn't know
any better,

498
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:35,327
I'd say you're
deliberately stalling.

499
00:21:35,396 --> 00:21:37,563
- Not at all.
- No way.

500
00:21:37,632 --> 00:21:40,466
Dating habits,
text messages, free gadgets.

501
00:21:40,535 --> 00:21:42,902
These are all essential
to your work here at NCIS?

502
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,638
Actually, yeah.

503
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:47,506
- Hey, Nick.
- What up?

504
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:50,409
Did you cancel
my date last night?

505
00:21:50,478 --> 00:21:51,544
Good morning.

506
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:53,245
I was supposed to have
a date last night,

507
00:21:53,314 --> 00:21:56,982
but according to Boyd,
I cancelled it.

508
00:21:57,051 --> 00:21:58,551
You sent a message

509
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:00,753
without telling me.
Gibbs was standing right there.

510
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:01,865
What do you want me to do,
let you get in trouble?

511
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:04,090
For getting a text message?

512
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:05,424
That doesn't make any sense.

513
00:22:05,493 --> 00:22:07,026
He didn't even know
who it was from.

514
00:22:07,095 --> 00:22:08,594
Yeah, he didn't care, either.

515
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:10,463
Pentagon records. Go.

516
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:13,199
Well, we still don't have
permission to access files.

517
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:15,367
In order to find
missing chemical weapons,

518
00:22:15,436 --> 00:22:17,081
we're gonna have
to hack into the Pentagon,

519
00:22:17,105 --> 00:22:18,504
which is a little risky.

520
00:22:18,573 --> 00:22:20,005
And a lot illegal.

521
00:22:20,074 --> 00:22:21,874
- Find a different way.
- We may already have.

522
00:22:21,943 --> 00:22:24,910
Torres and I are able to
access the next best thing.

523
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:27,046
Records to Trine
Chemical itself.

524
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:30,416
Uh, I'm sorry.
Nick is helping you hack?

525
00:22:30,485 --> 00:22:31,417
Hell yeah.

526
00:22:31,486 --> 00:22:32,885
- Hmm.
- Well, in my own way.

527
00:22:32,954 --> 00:22:35,332
There was a hidden camera, and
it was recording the entire time

528
00:22:35,356 --> 00:22:37,401
- while we were at the company.
- Including when Hartgrave

529
00:22:37,425 --> 00:22:40,126
entered his admin password.
- It was by accident.

530
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:42,005
Virginia is a one-party
consent state for recording.

531
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,429
You tracked his keystrokes?

532
00:22:43,498 --> 00:22:45,965
We do have a warrant
for security records

533
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:47,733
pertaining to our victim,
Keenan Grant.

534
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:50,870
Which doesn't cover
records of chemical weapons.

535
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:52,972
- So we don't download those.
-On purpose.

536
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,142
What about SecDef's order
to stand down?

537
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,576
Boss?

538
00:22:59,147 --> 00:23:00,412
Do it, McGee.

539
00:23:03,184 --> 00:23:04,795
All right, well, I suggest
you download as much as you can

540
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:06,152
as fast as you can.

541
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,319
Why?

542
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:08,866
A company this big
has security protocols

543
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,156
tracing outside IPs.

544
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:11,957
Which is why
I created a program

545
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:13,993
that'll alert me if I...

546
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,461
Ooh.

547
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,965
Alert me if I'm being traced.

548
00:23:20,034 --> 00:23:21,901
- Did they find you?
- Wrong question.

549
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:23,135
Did you get the file?

550
00:23:23,204 --> 00:23:24,737
Well, luckily, I was able to

551
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:26,972
directly download
to a secure backup.

552
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,074
Just need someone's computer
to open it.

553
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:31,944
There's our victim

554
00:23:32,013 --> 00:23:34,280
the night of his death.

555
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:35,781
He was working that night.

556
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,450
Hold up.
So was our scientist.

557
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,919
He lied to us.

558
00:23:39,987 --> 00:23:42,521
Why would the lead engineer
go on a random pickup?

559
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,157
Unless there was something
very valuable on that truck.

560
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:47,593
- Like chlorine?
- Is Hartgrave our killer?

561
00:23:47,662 --> 00:23:50,162
It's time to ask.
I'll get Gibbs.

562
00:23:50,231 --> 00:23:51,263
No need.

563
00:23:51,332 --> 00:23:53,365
Director.

564
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:55,601
Gibbs.

565
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,214
I just received a call
from Trine Chemical.

566
00:23:57,238 --> 00:24:00,539
Their cyber security
department, actually.

567
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:05,678
Did NCIS just participate
in a felony by hacking?

568
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:09,048
It's, uh, it's more
of a gray area, sir.

569
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,487
This is bad.

570
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:16,934
What are Torres and McGee
supposed to do?

571
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,490
Tell the truth.

572
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,392
Yeah, that's bad, right?

573
00:24:20,461 --> 00:24:22,027
Hartgrave.
Where is he?

574
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:24,007
According to company security,
he just clocked in.

575
00:24:24,031 --> 00:24:25,497
Okay, let's go.

576
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:28,167
Okay. Maybe it's not that bad.

577
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:33,973
That's the United States
Secretary of Defense.

578
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,975
- Let's go.
- He's making house calls now?

579
00:24:37,245 --> 00:24:39,345
Yeah. It's bad.

580
00:24:40,915 --> 00:24:42,648
Which brings us to now.

581
00:24:42,717 --> 00:24:44,817
So, as you can see,

582
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:48,354
our scientist lied about
being there and the gas.

583
00:24:48,422 --> 00:24:51,090
Yes. Yes, I do see.

584
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:53,158
I also see the need to
ask for Agent Gibbs' badge

585
00:24:53,261 --> 00:24:55,761
for allowing his agents
to break so many laws.

586
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,763
NCIS had a warrant, sir.

587
00:24:57,832 --> 00:25:01,333
And a reasonable fear that
Hartgrave could alter records

588
00:25:01,402 --> 00:25:03,102
if traditionally approached.

589
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,037
Hence the shrewd
computer tactics.

590
00:25:05,106 --> 00:25:06,839
Exactly.
Yeah, what he said.

591
00:25:06,907 --> 00:25:08,674
You stole government records.

592
00:25:08,743 --> 00:25:10,609
We proved that Hartgrave
was there.

593
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:13,178
At ground zero,
with the missing chlorine.

594
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:15,581
We have to assume it's going
to be used for an attack.

595
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,516
Sir, this guy knows
all the details.

596
00:25:17,585 --> 00:25:19,084
NCIS is going to break him.

597
00:25:19,153 --> 00:25:20,753
We just need more time.

598
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:25,524
Damn Skippy.

599
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:27,971
Medical's on the way.

600
00:25:27,995 --> 00:25:30,029
I won't accept their help.

601
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:33,432
Why not, Patton?

602
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:35,200
Is it shame?

603
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:36,535
Guilt?

604
00:25:36,604 --> 00:25:37,870
A man's dead.

605
00:25:37,938 --> 00:25:38,938
And you were there.

606
00:25:39,974 --> 00:25:41,073
We have you
with the victim

607
00:25:41,142 --> 00:25:42,486
the night of his death
and at the hotel

608
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,742
where his body was found.

609
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:46,078
He found out you
stole the chlorine, right?

610
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:47,313
- You killed him.
- No.

611
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:49,415
I...

612
00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:51,583
"I..."
Come on, finish the sentence.

613
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:52,785
"I am a murderer."

614
00:25:54,188 --> 00:25:56,422
Aw, come on, man. Own it.

615
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,957
Keenan's death was
an accident.

616
00:25:59,026 --> 00:26:00,159
I tried to save him.

617
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:01,894
- That's when you were exposed?
- Yes.

618
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:04,963
I was going to unload
the chlorine safely...

619
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:06,032
From the truck?

620
00:26:06,067 --> 00:26:07,333
It's not like I could

621
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:08,901
back my car up to
the loading dock.

622
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:11,904
But, uh...

623
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:14,840
...when we got to the hotel,
Keenan, he found the crate

624
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:16,508
and opened it before
I could stop him.

625
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:18,344
His crowbar must
have slipped, or--

626
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:21,146
He was dead by the time
I closed the valve.

627
00:26:21,215 --> 00:26:23,349
You saw the medical cadavers
and hid the body.

628
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:24,983
Wait,

629
00:26:25,052 --> 00:26:29,088
a good man
was doing his job,

630
00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:30,289
and you don't feel guilt?

631
00:26:30,358 --> 00:26:32,791
I do, about that.

632
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,327
Oh, but stealing barbaric
chemical weapons

633
00:26:35,396 --> 00:26:37,363
that could kill hundreds,
you're cool with that?

634
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,098
Steal. Right.
How can you <i>steal</i>

635
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,966
something that wasn't
even in our records?

636
00:26:41,035 --> 00:26:43,435
I found the canisters
in the vault.

637
00:26:43,504 --> 00:26:44,504
And <i>took</i> them.

638
00:26:44,572 --> 00:26:46,004
They weren't gonna miss it.

639
00:26:46,073 --> 00:26:48,207
Where's the gas?

640
00:26:49,543 --> 00:26:51,944
You know, I wanted
to believe that

641
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:53,645
I was doing my part

642
00:26:53,714 --> 00:26:57,716
to peacefully right
a few wrongs in this world.

643
00:26:57,785 --> 00:26:59,718
It wasn't enough.

644
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:01,687
Evil plays offense.

645
00:27:01,756 --> 00:27:04,156
Right. So now you are, too.

646
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:05,991
Not me.

647
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,396
No, the citizens being gassed
by their own government.

648
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,965
They need a weapon
just as strong.

649
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:16,168
We armed the Afghans
against the Russians, right?

650
00:27:16,237 --> 00:27:18,404
Or what about the Contras
in the '80s?

651
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:19,472
Where is the gas?!

652
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,007
On its way to freedom fighters.

653
00:27:22,076 --> 00:27:24,410
They understand what
I'm trying to accomplish.

654
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:27,846
Have you seen the videos
of those kids dying?

655
00:27:27,915 --> 00:27:29,648
Please listen to me.

656
00:27:29,717 --> 00:27:31,717
Your supposed nobility
is gonna get

657
00:27:31,786 --> 00:27:33,719
a lot more people killed.
- No.

658
00:27:33,788 --> 00:27:36,422
No, the gas will be
in good hands...

659
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,856
...once it gets to Syria.

660
00:27:37,925 --> 00:27:39,858
Members of terrorist
organizations

661
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:42,561
have been known to join
your freedom fighters

662
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,364
to gain Intel
or to steal weapons.

663
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:47,043
You don't know where
the gas will end up, do you?

664
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:49,045
Word about these kind
of things gets around.

665
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:50,436
Bad guys come out
of the woodwork.

666
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:54,573
No. What's done is done.

667
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,509
I hope you have
some ideas, Ellie.

668
00:27:57,578 --> 00:27:58,789
I don't know how
to reach this guy.

669
00:27:58,813 --> 00:28:00,078
Well, he'll admit
to everything,

670
00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:01,246
but won't give up the gas.

671
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:02,247
You can't argue with crazy.

672
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:03,449
Oh, he's not crazy.

673
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:04,583
He's principled.

674
00:28:04,652 --> 00:28:06,084
That's how he sees it.

675
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:08,220
His last act on earth
is totally righteous.

676
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:10,923
Until it's not,
but by then, he'll be dead.

677
00:28:10,991 --> 00:28:12,925
We need more time.

678
00:28:14,762 --> 00:28:17,396
No, no more time, Director.

679
00:28:17,465 --> 00:28:18,797
There's missing gas out there.

680
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,799
Sir, that's what
we've been saying.

681
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:22,179
All the more reason
to turn it over to Homeland

682
00:28:22,203 --> 00:28:23,936
and the FBI as soon
as possible.

683
00:28:24,004 --> 00:28:26,116
As far as Agent Gibbs
and his team are concerned,

684
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,473
they'll get their
day in court.

685
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:29,541
- We'll be discreet.
- I don't give a damn

686
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,743
about appearances, sir.

687
00:28:31,812 --> 00:28:33,445
There are chemical
weapons out there.

688
00:28:33,514 --> 00:28:35,414
And you want to waste time
transferring the case

689
00:28:35,483 --> 00:28:38,116
when the lead suspect is--
is right in front of us.

690
00:28:38,185 --> 00:28:39,963
That press conference
is ready to begin. - I have an idea.

691
00:28:39,987 --> 00:28:42,054
- Me, too. What's yours?
- Anything else?

692
00:28:42,122 --> 00:28:43,530
Secretary Crawford,
you are making a big mistake.

693
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:44,891
That's what I was thinking.

694
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:48,260
You're right, but the mistake
is wasting time in here.

695
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,950
Agent Torres,
what the hell are you doing?

696
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,913
Yeah, what are you doing?

697
00:29:07,982 --> 00:29:10,516
Wait, this wasn't your idea?

698
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:12,251
No, SCIF mode was my idea.

699
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,964
Then why did you look at
my gun on the table?

700
00:29:13,988 --> 00:29:15,320
I wasn't looking at your gun.

701
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:17,422
Director Vance,

702
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:18,991
are your agents threatening

703
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:21,026
the United States Secretary
of Defense?

704
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:26,431
I certainly hope not.

705
00:29:36,353 --> 00:29:39,888
I figure every 20 minutes
you hold me hostage,

706
00:29:39,956 --> 00:29:41,823
there's another year
on your sentence.

707
00:29:41,892 --> 00:29:44,893
Huh? Wait, what? Hostage?

708
00:29:44,961 --> 00:29:45,908
Well, that's what you're
doing, isn't it?

709
00:29:45,932 --> 00:29:46,795
No. No, no, no.

710
00:29:46,796 --> 00:29:47,962
Not at all.

711
00:29:48,031 --> 00:29:50,899
Well, SCIF mode cuts
cell service...

712
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:51,900
and you're armed.

713
00:29:51,968 --> 00:29:54,135
Oh-- Oh, this?

714
00:29:54,204 --> 00:29:56,237
Oh, no, this is, uh,
it's still holstered.

715
00:29:56,306 --> 00:29:58,373
Yeah, we-we're merely
asking for more time, sir.

716
00:29:58,441 --> 00:30:01,342
Your suspect isn't gonna talk.
He's made that quite clear.

717
00:30:01,411 --> 00:30:04,345
I told you,
I don't want any medical help.

718
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,719
Hey!

719
00:30:11,788 --> 00:30:13,354
I want my phone call!

720
00:30:15,258 --> 00:30:19,027
I... I-- geez,
I want to talk to my mom.

721
00:30:19,095 --> 00:30:21,863
Security lockdown on...
Going on lockdown.

722
00:30:21,932 --> 00:30:25,400
We got first responders
on the ground...

723
00:30:34,578 --> 00:30:35,710
No.

724
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:37,512
Bishop, no. Stop, stop.

725
00:30:37,581 --> 00:30:40,281
You stay there. No!

726
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,183
Y-You keep me informed.

727
00:30:44,654 --> 00:30:46,788
Hey. What's-what's going on?

728
00:30:46,856 --> 00:30:48,790
Is something wrong?

729
00:30:51,795 --> 00:30:53,728
Authorities are just arriving
on the scene.

730
00:30:53,797 --> 00:30:56,764
Metro bomb squad and Hazmat
teams have entered the building.

731
00:30:56,833 --> 00:31:00,234
While federal authorities have
yet to issue a formal statement,

732
00:31:00,303 --> 00:31:03,071
police are asking everyone
in the greater D.C. area

733
00:31:03,139 --> 00:31:04,939
to remain in their homes.

734
00:31:05,008 --> 00:31:07,442
Your gas was used in an attack.

735
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,645
Again, here is the footage
WJGZ received earlier,

736
00:31:10,714 --> 00:31:12,280
taken with a cell phone.

737
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:15,116
This video may not be suitable
for younger viewers.

738
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,266
Go, go, go!

739
00:31:32,335 --> 00:31:35,236
No. This doesn't make any sense.

740
00:31:35,305 --> 00:31:37,572
- Of course it doesn't.
- It's terrorism!

741
00:31:37,641 --> 00:31:38,851
Which means
your last act on Earth

742
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:40,219
will be the killing
of innocent people.

743
00:31:40,243 --> 00:31:41,843
Think that'll fit
on your headstone?

744
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:44,278
- I'll make sure it does.
- No, no. That's not...

745
00:31:44,347 --> 00:31:45,371
That's-that's not what I...

746
00:31:45,395 --> 00:31:47,395
Well, then, you give me
someone else to blame!

747
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:51,185
Uh, okay, uh, I-I gave the crate
to a customs agent.

748
00:31:51,254 --> 00:31:52,920
Address.

749
00:31:52,989 --> 00:31:55,323
Uh, he didn't know
what was inside.

750
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,824
He must have opened it.

751
00:32:01,498 --> 00:32:02,930
Leon, is this
what I think it is?

752
00:32:11,408 --> 00:32:13,374
I'll be damned.

753
00:32:17,013 --> 00:32:18,893
I'm now being told
Closed circuit, channel five.

754
00:32:18,948 --> 00:32:20,860
the hotel has been evacuated,
and that emergency services

755
00:32:20,884 --> 00:32:23,551
are continuing to fan out
throughout the area...

756
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,187
Hey, uh, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Ross,

757
00:32:26,256 --> 00:32:27,522
but you can stop reading now.

758
00:32:32,862 --> 00:32:37,331
The, uh, script ended,
so I improvised that last part.

759
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,111
- I hope that was okay.
- Agent Bishop texted me.

760
00:32:39,135 --> 00:32:40,334
You were perfect.

761
00:32:40,403 --> 00:32:43,971
Mr. Secretary,
Mr. Director.

762
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,373
Thank you so much
for allowing me

763
00:32:45,442 --> 00:32:46,886
to be a part
of your operations drill.

764
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:50,311
I, uh, have to say,
this was a new one for me.

765
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,013
Yeah. Us, too.

766
00:32:52,082 --> 00:32:54,048
Miss Hines, this broadcast

767
00:32:54,117 --> 00:32:56,818
was only sent via
closed circuit, right?

768
00:32:56,886 --> 00:32:59,187
- Yes. Our building only, Director.
- The footage,

769
00:32:59,255 --> 00:33:01,489
the running people.
- Uh, the agents

770
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:03,891
at the seminar,
they were happy to help.

771
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,261
We told them it was an exercise
in "Optics In Law Enforcement."

772
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,163
And the bodies
were the cadavers.

773
00:33:09,232 --> 00:33:10,865
Not exactly, sir,

774
00:33:10,934 --> 00:33:13,668
but I like where your head
is at.

775
00:33:14,804 --> 00:33:17,371
I'm so sorry, uh, Mr. Secretary.

776
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:21,075
Where the hell is Gibbs?

777
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,783
Federal agents.

778
00:33:28,852 --> 00:33:30,852
Hey, put your hands
in the air.

779
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,220
Back away from the container.

780
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,879
Oh, looks good.

781
00:34:00,683 --> 00:34:03,050
All clear, six-eight.

782
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,828
Wow. These are old, huh?

783
00:34:13,897 --> 00:34:17,365
Why weren't they destroyed?

784
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:20,668
Recovering that gas
does not absolve NCIS.

785
00:34:20,737 --> 00:34:22,937
In addition to disobeying
orders, illegal hacking

786
00:34:23,006 --> 00:34:25,306
and-and threatening a government
official, you can add...

787
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:27,575
well, hell, I don't even know
what to call this charade.

788
00:34:27,644 --> 00:34:29,443
It's not coercion and
it's not entrapment.

789
00:34:29,512 --> 00:34:31,913
- Not helping, Agent McGee.
- And I blame you, Leon.

790
00:34:31,981 --> 00:34:34,615
Is this how you run your house?
And where the hell is Gibbs?

791
00:34:34,684 --> 00:34:36,918
Right here.

792
00:34:36,986 --> 00:34:38,946
Gibbs, you can add your badge
to the growing pile.

793
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,260
You should have this, too.

794
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:47,862
And what's that?

795
00:34:47,931 --> 00:34:51,666
Trine Chemical said they
destroyed all their chlorine,

796
00:34:51,734 --> 00:34:52,834
per military
contracts.

797
00:34:52,902 --> 00:34:54,502
Well, that's total BS.

798
00:34:54,571 --> 00:34:57,138
Yeah, they lied to save a
buck. Millions, actually.

799
00:34:57,207 --> 00:34:58,539
We went through their records.

800
00:34:58,608 --> 00:34:59,674
Illegally obtained.

801
00:34:59,742 --> 00:35:01,042
No, pretty sure
we had a warrant.

802
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,476
When this is all over,

803
00:35:02,545 --> 00:35:04,645
company stock will crash.
- Let it.

804
00:35:04,714 --> 00:35:07,481
They defrauded the United States
government. Your point?

805
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,617
My point, sir, is that you
are a major shareholder,

806
00:35:09,686 --> 00:35:11,096
and you stand to lose
a lot of money.

807
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,987
You think I stepped in
because of money?

808
00:35:13,056 --> 00:35:15,022
Or your friendship with the CEO.

809
00:35:15,091 --> 00:35:18,025
I-It never occurred to me
that...

810
00:35:18,094 --> 00:35:21,362
I had no idea Trine was involved
when State asked me to step in.

811
00:35:21,431 --> 00:35:22,797
Relax. We know.

812
00:35:22,866 --> 00:35:24,999
And I haven't talked
to George Green in months.

813
00:35:25,068 --> 00:35:26,412
Certainly not in the last
few days. We checked.

814
00:35:26,436 --> 00:35:29,570
Geez, this looks bad.

815
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:31,772
Doesn't always mean
there was a crime.

816
00:35:31,841 --> 00:35:33,407
Right, Director?

817
00:35:36,446 --> 00:35:39,480
I guess NCIS
weren't the only ones

818
00:35:39,549 --> 00:35:40,882
who jumped the gun a little.

819
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,183
Outside of briefings,

820
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:43,652
and the occasional
social gathering,

821
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,219
you and I don't know
each other, Leon.

822
00:35:45,288 --> 00:35:47,655
I assumed the worst.

823
00:35:47,724 --> 00:35:49,857
Well, we all make mistakes.

824
00:35:49,926 --> 00:35:52,037
Yes, as Agent Gibbs and his
team have just reminded me.

825
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:53,661
Well, if that's
it, Director,

826
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:56,097
I got a press
conference to attend.

827
00:35:56,165 --> 00:35:56,885
Sir?

828
00:35:56,909 --> 00:35:57,833
I have to get
in front of this.

829
00:35:57,834 --> 00:36:02,737
Take responsibility for my part,
and congratulate NCIS on theirs.

830
00:36:02,805 --> 00:36:04,906
Maybe next time,

831
00:36:04,974 --> 00:36:08,542
we could both be
a little more careful. Yeah?

832
00:36:19,255 --> 00:36:21,289
Nope.

833
00:36:21,357 --> 00:36:22,423
Well done.

834
00:36:22,492 --> 00:36:24,625
- This is yours.
- Oh. Thank you.

835
00:36:24,694 --> 00:36:26,438
In a news conference
addressing this discovery,

836
00:36:26,462 --> 00:36:28,763
United States Secretary
of Defense Wynn Crawford

837
00:36:28,831 --> 00:36:30,865
noted that the allegations
against Trine Chemical

838
00:36:30,934 --> 00:36:32,566
are an isolated event.

839
00:36:32,635 --> 00:36:35,536
Wow, a politician willing
to admit that he was wrong.

840
00:36:35,605 --> 00:36:37,182
- It's refreshing.
- I knew everything

841
00:36:37,206 --> 00:36:38,906
was gonna be fine.

842
00:36:38,975 --> 00:36:41,108
I never doubted Gibbs
one second.

843
00:36:41,177 --> 00:36:42,944
I did. But I'm learning.

844
00:36:47,517 --> 00:36:49,583
Hey, Ellie?

845
00:36:49,652 --> 00:36:50,652
Hmm?

846
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,561
You have a sec?

847
00:36:53,562 --> 00:36:55,195
Yeah. What's up?

848
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,134
I just wanted to apologize
about your date.

849
00:37:01,203 --> 00:37:04,004
Next time that Boyd and you
go out to dinner,

850
00:37:04,073 --> 00:37:05,505
uh, it'll be on me.

851
00:37:05,574 --> 00:37:08,809
Thanks, but it's not about that.

852
00:37:08,877 --> 00:37:10,677
Okay.

853
00:37:10,746 --> 00:37:13,046
We have to trust
each other, Nick,

854
00:37:13,115 --> 00:37:15,849
for the big things
and the small things.

855
00:37:15,918 --> 00:37:17,484
It matters.

856
00:37:17,553 --> 00:37:20,187
It was a mistake.
I shouldn't have sent that text.

857
00:37:20,255 --> 00:37:21,488
So why did you?

858
00:37:25,594 --> 00:37:28,862
Okay. Good night, Nick.

859
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:32,499
Ellie, wait.

860
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,676
Good night.

861
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:57,724
Kasie, hey.

862
00:37:57,793 --> 00:37:59,926
Did you, uh, get anything
you wanted from here?

863
00:37:59,995 --> 00:38:01,394
'Cause I don't need
all this stuff.

864
00:38:01,463 --> 00:38:03,396
Oh, I'm good. What I really want

865
00:38:03,465 --> 00:38:04,965
is one of
their Nixie tube clocks.

866
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,467
- Oh, those are cool.
- I know, right?

867
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:10,036
I even called the company
to see what it would take

868
00:38:10,105 --> 00:38:11,738
to send me one for free,
like you.

869
00:38:11,807 --> 00:38:13,807
Really?

870
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:15,286
Yeah, I offered to test
all their products

871
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,210
and point out bugs and stuff,

872
00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:20,814
but they said they don't send
free gift boxes, ever.

873
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:22,415
They said
they only send goodies

874
00:38:22,484 --> 00:38:26,620
to, like, prospective employees.

875
00:38:27,956 --> 00:38:29,756
Okay. I'm being headhunted.

876
00:38:29,825 --> 00:38:31,725
Yeah, you are.

877
00:38:31,794 --> 00:38:33,293
And?

878
00:38:33,362 --> 00:38:34,895
And it feels pretty good.

879
00:38:34,963 --> 00:38:36,897
I knew it.
You're gonna leave NCIS

880
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:39,299
for a sexy,
multimillion dollar job

881
00:38:39,368 --> 00:38:42,102
at one of the coolest
tech companies in the world.

882
00:38:42,171 --> 00:38:45,105
No, no, no. I mean, I am--
well, I'm being offered

883
00:38:45,174 --> 00:38:50,143
a lot of money, but, uh,
you know, really, it's...

884
00:38:50,212 --> 00:38:52,312
Please don't tell anyone.

885
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:54,347
I would never
tell anyone, McGee.

886
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:57,484
But they are detectives.

887
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:05,192
How y'all doing?

888
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,761
Don't let that stuff
go to your head now.

889
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:11,498
Sorry I'm late.

890
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:14,935
Someone in your position
is never late.

891
00:39:15,003 --> 00:39:17,404
CIA was surprised
to get your call, sir.

892
00:39:17,472 --> 00:39:20,307
I understand you've been
tracking Leon Vance.

893
00:39:23,712 --> 00:39:25,612
No idea
what you're talking about.

894
00:39:25,681 --> 00:39:27,781
I want everything you have.

895
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:30,851
Is this business or pleasure?

896
00:39:30,919 --> 00:39:33,386
Now, how's
the salmon here?

897
