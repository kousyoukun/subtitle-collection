15
00:00:46,892 --> 00:00:48,358
这两个是涉事的探员吗
Are these the agents responsible?

16
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:51,628
我就说一句 如果知道密码还算黑吗
I mean, is it hacking if you had the password?

17
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:54,631
交出武器和警徽 马上

25
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,841
部长先生 我自己还在了解情况中
Mr. Secretary, I'm playing catch-up myself.

26
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:51,997
-你的特别探员有没有犯罪 -我知道情况看起来不妙
- Did your agents commit a crime? - I agree it looks bad.

27
00:01:51,998 --> 00:01:53,423
但是不意味着有人犯了罪
Doesn't always mean that there's a crime.

28
00:01:53,424 --> 00:01:55,402
-我来这儿不是为了听悲伤的故事的 -你是来问答案的
- I'm not here for sad stories. - You're here for answers.

29
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:57,104
联邦机构违法了 我得赶在
A federal agency breaking the law? I have to get

30
00:01:57,128 --> 00:01:58,705
全国的媒体知道之前解决这事儿
ahead of this before it breaks to national media.

31
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:00,462
那我们就保证将它妥善解决
Then let's make sure we get it right.

32
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:01,730
我们都想知道事实
We both want the truth.

33
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,399
当然了 你是在说
Damn Skippy. Are you suggesting

34
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:04,845
这后头还有什么无懈可击的原因吗
there's a perfectly good reason for this?

35
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:06,202
我什么都没说
I'm not saying a damn word,

36
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,803
但是McGee和Torres探员

从头开始 一个细节都不落
from the beginning, in great detail.

39
00:02:13,144 --> 00:02:15,911
我们的生死就取决于此了吗
As if our necks depended on it?

40

培训是我的主意
That training was my idea.

在发布到社交媒体上后

62
00:03:15,273 --> 00:03:16,739
还能怎样做得更好吗

Hey, let me tell you something, Gibbs and McGee owe us big time.

100
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:52,868
好吧 级别高也不能这么干
Okay, that's not exactly how seniority works.

101

嗯 再来两天我可忍不了

118
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:46,333
我们就是想找个安静点的地方

All right, look, why don't you guys just wait outside?

123
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:57,010
-嗯 -我去看看灯在哪儿

别等我 继续
Don't wait for me. Continue.

132
00:06:37,822 --> 00:06:39,766
或许你想让我把房间调成SCIF模式
Perhaps you'd like to me to put the room in SCIF mode, sir,

133
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,970
这样我们就不会被打扰了
so we won't be disturbed.

134
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:42,849
没必要 Leon 我就是在跟外头的属下说
No need, Leon. I was just telling my people outside

135
00:06:42,873 --> 00:06:44,005

I have yet to hear

137
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,676
能让我改主意的事
anything that changes my mind.

138
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:50,745
这可能有帮助
This might help.

139
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:56,351
请坐
Sit down, please.

140
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,854
不用了 我还是站着吧
Oh, no thanks, I'd rather stand.

141
00:06:58,922 --> 00:07:01,356
对循环和呼吸好
It's better for circulation and breathing.

142
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:03,525
-你没得选 坐下 -我在看什么
- Wasn't an option. Sit down. - What am I looking at?

143
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:06,027
这是我们审讯室的闭路电视
It's a closed-circuit feed from our interrogation room.

144
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:08,930
这个嫌疑人是一个正在进行中的
This suspect is the key to an investigation

145
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:10,699
-调查的关键人物 -他是谁
- already in full swing. - Who is he?

146
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:13,268
能帮助我们阻止恐怖袭击的人
The man who will help us prevent an act of terrorism.

147
00:07:13,337 --> 00:07:16,938
恐怖主义 你们能证明吗
Terrorism? You can prove that?

148
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:18,940
McGee探员 Torres探员
Agents McGee, Torres.

149
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:21,376
宾馆里的尸体
The bodies at the hotel.

150
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:23,044
对
Right.

151
00:07:23,113 --> 00:07:25,180
好了 别围在这里 你们都是联邦探员
All right, keep clear. You are all Federal agents.

152
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,882
-你们知道该怎么做 -大伙们
- You know how this works. - Everyone,

153
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,351
请自行回到研讨会去
please make your way back to the seminar.

154
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:32,621
或者留下来 跟NCIS学学怎么办事儿 宝贝
Or stay and NCIS will show you how it's done, baby.

155
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:34,389
显然你的女儿感觉好多了
Clearly your daughter's feeling better.

156
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,458
拜托 大伙
Come on, people.

157
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:37,726
把这里弄成犯罪现场
Making this a crime scene

158
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:39,794
非常草率 Gibbs探员
was very premature, Agent Gibbs.

159
00:07:39,863 --> 00:07:43,031
你的探员制造了不必要的混乱
Your agents created chaos for nothing.

160
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,367
-看起来不是完全没必要 -这家酒店
- Doesn't look like nothing. - This hotel

161
00:07:45,435 --> 00:07:49,037
只以最高标准和等级运行
operates with only the highest standards and class.

162
00:07:49,106 --> 00:07:50,305
Richard
Richard!

163
00:07:50,374 --> 00:07:51,973
嗯
Um...

164
00:07:54,244 --> 00:07:56,211
我九分钟前就跟你要了
I asked for this nine minutes ago.

165
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,847
如你所见
As you can see,

166
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,483
这里有医学会议
there's a medical conference starting in here

167
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:02,484
明早开始
tomorrow morning.

168
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:04,686
欧 手术机器人
Oh, surgical robots?

169
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:07,889
会议由制作它们的公司赞助
The conference is sponsored by the company that makes them.

170
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,591
与会者将能够
The attendees will be able

171
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,259
在这里测试机器人
to test the robots right here.

172
00:08:11,328 --> 00:08:13,528
-在尸体上 -所以他们是医学尸体
- On the bodies. - Making them medical cadavers,

173
00:08:13,597 --> 00:08:15,430
不是被谋杀的受害者
not murder victims.

174
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:18,700
所以我们能在媒体把这里变成某种
So can we wrap this up before the media gets wind

175
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:22,170
Jonestown惨案的续集之前赶紧完事么
【注：1978年11月18日，美国邪教组织“人民圣殿教”的信徒在教主吉姆·琼斯的胁迫下
在南美洲圭亚那琼斯镇（Jonestown）集体自杀。】
and turns this into some kind of Jonestown sequel?

176
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:25,006
太迟了 电视台的老Ross已经在隔壁了
Too late. Guy Ross was already next door.

177
00:08:25,075 --> 00:08:27,275
他想采访一下
He's looking for an interview.

178
00:08:27,344 --> 00:08:30,178
这里没有违法行为
There's nothing illegal here.

179
00:08:30,247 --> 00:08:34,049
这20个医学尸体都是合法的
These 20 medical cadavers are completely legal.

180
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:35,784
我们数了数是21件
We actually counted 21.

181
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:37,419
-什么 -对
- Excuse me? - Yeah.

182
00:08:37,487 --> 00:08:38,954
我也是 数了21件
Same here, 21 bodies.

183
00:08:39,022 --> 00:08:40,066
不 不 那太扯了
Oh, no, no, that's ridiculous.

184
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,790
不 不 我有文件
No, no, no. I have the paperwork

185
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:43,892
在这 Gibbs探员
right here, Agent Gibbs.

186
00:08:43,961 --> 00:08:45,593
你的人肯定数错了
Clearly your people miscounted.

187
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:47,963
或者这里的某具尸体不属于这里
Or one of these bodies doesn't belong.

188
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:49,297
我们再查查
We'll check.

189
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:56,204
黑杰克 也被称为21点
Blackjack, also known as 21.

190
00:08:56,273 --> 00:08:59,307
21响礼炮 21岁是可以赌博的年级
21-gun salute. 21 is the gambling age.

191
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:02,243
也是可以喝酒的年纪 根据一项被
It's also the drinking age, and according to a study

192
00:09:02,312 --> 00:09:04,813
医学界广泛反驳的研究表明
which is widely dismissed by the medical community,

193
00:09:04,881 --> 00:09:09,384
人类的灵魂重达21克
the human soul weighs 21 grams.

194
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:11,753
Jim医生 有何发现
Dr. Jim, what do we know?

195
00:09:11,822 --> 00:09:13,788
21其实是文化中很重要的一个数字
21 was a culturally significant number.

196
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:15,457
对他而言尤其重要 你知道身份了么
Significant for him. You got an ID?

197
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:17,225
我刚把指纹送到Kasie那里了
I just sent the prints up to Kasie,

198
00:09:17,294 --> 00:09:19,728
不过这个尸体是那堆尸体中唯一一个
but since this body was the only body without a toe tag

199
00:09:19,796 --> 00:09:21,796
没有标牌和任何正当文件的
or any proper paperwork for cadavers...

200
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:22,897
不是医学尸体
Not a cadaver.

201
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:25,967
还好有NCIS在那里记数
Good thing NCIS was there to count.

202
00:09:26,036 --> 00:09:28,603
这个尸体内部温度
This man did have an internal core temperature

203
00:09:28,672 --> 00:09:30,071
有75华氏度
【注：大约23.9摄氏度】
of 75 degrees.

204
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,607
-所以他是最近才死的 -对 很可能是昨晚
- So his time of death was recent. - Yeah, last night-ish.

205
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:34,909
没有看出明显死因
There's no obvious signs of a cause of death,

206
00:09:34,978 --> 00:09:36,845
但是他眼睛里还有鼻子 喉咙
though there's some slight discoloration

207
00:09:36,913 --> 00:09:39,080
有一些轻微的变色
in his eyes, as well as his nose, throat.

208
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:40,482
吸入了什么坏东西么
Breathed something bad?

209
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,417
也许吧 他肯定不是老死的
Maybe. He certainly didn't die of old age.

210
00:09:42,486 --> 00:09:43,918
我猜他大概不到三十岁吧
I'd put him in his late 20s.

211
00:09:43,987 --> 00:09:45,253
有伤疤 胎记么
Any scars, any markings?

212
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:47,489
没 没什么标志性的标记
No, no, nothing outwardly identifying,

213
00:09:47,557 --> 00:09:51,760
所以我们得看看里面
which is why we must look inward.

214
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:53,962
最好退后几步
Might want to step back.

215
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:56,865
那肯定不对头 因为没有什么法律
That has to be wrong because there are no laws

216
00:09:56,933 --> 00:09:58,767
能不允许在舞厅里面摆尸体
against bodies in ballrooms.

217
00:09:58,835 --> 00:10:01,269
显然 确实有这么一回事 你读读
Apparently, it's a thing. Read.

218
00:10:01,338 --> 00:10:03,538
对于未注册的医学尸体有很多相关法律
There are many laws about unregistered cadavers.

219
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,342
我们还继续约会吗

220
00:10:05,342 --> 00:10:05,830
那这哥们儿是哪里冒出来的呢
So where did this guy come from?
我们还继续约会吗

221
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,708
那这哥们儿是哪里冒出来的呢
So where did this guy come from?

222
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:10,512
我希望能找出原因
I'm hopefully about to find out.

223
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,050
抱歉 得忙工作

224
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:24,192
这就怪了
Oh. Oh, that's odd.

225
00:10:24,261 --> 00:10:26,728
-什么意思 -尸体中没有肺
- What're we looking at? - A body without lungs.

226
00:10:26,797 --> 00:10:29,330
它们都被
They have completely...

227
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:32,867
完全分解了
disintegrated.

228
00:10:34,738 --> 00:10:36,671
哇偶 等等
<i>Whoa, whoa. Hold up.</i>

229
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,641
你问都没问就取消了Bishop的约会吗
So you did cancel Bishop's date without asking?

230
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:43,778
没有 我就是 我就说了句 “抱歉啊 得忙工作”
No, I just, all I said was, uh, uh, "Sorry, work stuff,"

231
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:46,247
因为 你看 她工作太忙就没回复
because, you know, she was too busy working to reply.

232
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:47,682
听上去确实是取消了约会
Sounds like you cancelled.

233
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:48,895
我们是不是跑题了
Maybe we're getting off topic?

234
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,096
你也没时间了
And you're running out of time.

235
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,397
我手机马上就响 告诉我
My phone's gonna ring, telling me

236
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:52,565
媒体见面会就要开始了
the press conference is about to start.

237
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:53,755
媒体见面会
Press conference?

238
00:10:53,824 --> 00:10:55,757
两个NCIS探员被逮捕了
Two NCIS agents are being arrested.

239
00:10:55,826 --> 00:10:57,425
我得争取舆论上的主动
I have to get ahead of this.

240
00:10:57,494 --> 00:10:59,561
所以我猜某人马上就要讲到重点了
So I suggest someone get to the damn point.

241
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:00,862
那人肯定是Tim
That'd be Tim.

242
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:02,030
我当时不在解剖室
I wasn't in autopsy,

243
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:03,565
但后来我们的法医科学家
but I was in the bullpen later

244
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:06,201
来汇报消息的时候 我正在职员办公大厅里
when our forensic scientist came in with news.

245
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:07,569
嘿
Hey.

246
00:11:07,637 --> 00:11:08,770
-嘿 -哇
- Hey. - Whoa.

247
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,405
-这什么时候到这的 -哦
- When did this get here? - Oh.

248
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:13,007
邮车刚来放下的 这次你又订了什么
Uh, mail cart just came by. What did you order this time?

249
00:11:13,076 --> 00:11:14,320
什么 你开玩笑么 Splendifida的东西
What, are you kidding? I can't afford anything

250
00:11:14,344 --> 00:11:15,710
我哪买得起啊
from Splendifida.

251
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,012
但是他们做的东西确实不错
But they do make nice stuff.

252
00:11:18,081 --> 00:11:19,848
你确定没有疯狂购物吗
You're sure you didn't gadget splurge?

253
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,616
也许是梦游剁手
Maybe in your sleep?

254
00:11:21,685 --> 00:11:24,552
不可能 Delilah每天11点半之后都会封锁信用卡通道
No, Delilah blocked all credit card access after 11:30 p.m.

255
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:26,921
确实是寄给我的 怪了
It is addressed to me. Weird.

256
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,123
拦住媒体
Stop the presses.

257
00:11:28,191 --> 00:11:29,224
别挂机
Hold the phone.

258
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:30,425
也别跑
And the horses.

259
00:11:30,494 --> 00:11:31,893
我刚得到了咱们解剖室尸体的
I just got the results back

260
00:11:31,962 --> 00:11:33,795
搜索结果
from our body in autopsy,

261
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:36,364
我们已经回溯了时光
and we have traveled back in time.

262
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:38,032
-那是好是坏啊 -坏
- Is that good or bad? - Bad.

263
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:39,968
你看过科幻电影么
Have you ever watched a science-fiction movie?

264
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:43,738
空间时间的统一性决不能被干扰
The space-time continuum should never be disrupted.

265
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:44,807
你知道死因了么
You got a cause of death.

266
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:47,275
把时间拨回一战时期
Set the wayback machine for World War I.

267
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:50,211
我们神秘尸体的肺
The lungs in our mystery body have disintegrated

268
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,715
是由于暴露在有毒氯气中才发生了分解
from exposure to toxic chlorine gas.

269
00:11:53,783 --> 00:11:56,784
这种毒气是以战争犯罪被日内瓦公约所禁止了的
The kind banned by the Geneva Convention as a war crime.

270
00:11:56,853 --> 00:11:58,453
被害者是被
Victim was killed

271
00:11:58,522 --> 00:11:59,954
化学武器杀害
by a chemical weapon.

272
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:02,957
穿越时光不是好事儿啊
Time travel is always bad.

273
00:12:10,257 --> 00:12:12,023
-当心 -哦
- Heads up. - Oh.

274
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:14,025
好了 氯气 太坏了
Okay. Chlorine gas. That's bad.

275
00:12:14,094 --> 00:12:16,139
但是我已经知道这一个受害者了 到现在为止
But I already knew about this one victim. And, so far,

276
00:12:16,163 --> 00:12:17,696
我还没见到任何证据表明
I haven't seen any evidence to suggest

277
00:12:17,764 --> 00:12:19,264
有更大的恐怖威胁
a greater threat of terrorism.

278
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,099
我们知道了消失的毒气
We know about the missing gas.

279
00:12:21,168 --> 00:12:22,934
啥
I'm sorry?

280
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:25,637
失踪的那批化学武器
The missing batch of chemical weapons?

281
00:12:25,706 --> 00:12:27,973
足够毒死一整个城市街区的人
Enough to poison an entire city block.

282
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,307
他们在说什么
What are they talking about?

283
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:31,543
更大的恐怖威胁
"A greater threat of terrorism."

284
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:33,445
我们有一具神秘死尸
We had a mystery dead body

285
00:12:33,513 --> 00:12:35,947
是被氯气杀死的 这很糟糕
killed by chlorine gas. That's bad.

286
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:38,483
但是到Kasie进来并生动形象地给我们上了一课之前
But we didn't know how bad until Kasie came in

287
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:42,554
我们都不知道这有多糟糕
and, well, gave a very moving presentation.

288
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,458
我 我在展示之前需要休息一会
I, uh, I'm gonna need a minute before my presentation.

289
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:48,493
你还好么
You okay?

290
00:12:48,562 --> 00:12:51,129
我很好 只是 得歇一歇
Totally. Just, uh, need a beat.

291
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:54,366
-嗯 -哥们 这都什么东西啊
- Hmm. - Yeah, dude. What is all this stuff?

292
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:58,870
无人机 VR眼镜 瞧这个
Drones, VR goggles, oh, check this out.

293
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:00,383
这是他们冬季风格目录里面的
This is from their winter style catalogue.

294
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:01,840
是个腕表
It's a wristwatch.

295
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:04,075
有一个隐藏的摄像机和隐藏的小刀
It's got a hidden camera and a hidden knife.

296
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:05,977
-隐藏小刀 -对
- A hidden knife? - Yeah.

297
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:08,546
哇
Whoa.

298
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:10,548
-我喜欢隐藏的小刀 -嗯
- I like hidden knives. - Yeah.

299
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:12,017
这都是免费的么
Was all this stuff free?

300
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:14,419
我上个月给那公司发了邮件
You know, I e-mailed the company last month.

301
00:13:14,488 --> 00:13:17,422
可能是因为我发现了什么 用户界面的小问题
It must be because I pointed some, uh, U.I. glitches

302
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:20,258
还有 我最新机器小狗里面的软件bug
and software bugs on my new robotic dog.

303
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:22,927
这是给双胞胎的圣诞礼物
It's a Christmas gift for the twins.

304
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:24,829
对 当然
Yeah, of course.

305
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:27,098
好了 我准备好了
Okay, I'm ready.

306
00:13:29,503 --> 00:13:34,239
氯气是在1915年由Fritz Haber制造出来的
Chlorine gas was developed in 1915 by Fritz Haber.

307
00:13:34,307 --> 00:13:35,840
主要是用来绕过自动推进
It was mainly to get around a treaty

308
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:37,676
武器的禁止条约
prohibiting the use of projectiles.

309
00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:40,045
氯气贴着地面扩散
Chlorine hovers at ground level

310
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:43,248
呈现为黄绿色的云状 闻起来有菠萝和胡椒的味道
in yellow-green clouds that smell like pineapple and pepper.

311
00:13:43,316 --> 00:13:44,716
还会混入肺部
And melt lungs.

312
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:46,518
纯粹的邪恶 真的 所以 自然的
Pure evil, really. So, of course,

313
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:49,721
美国和俄国在冷战期间制造了成吨的氯气
the U.S. and Russia developed tons of it during the Cold War.

314
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,790
说实在的 人类有时候真挺差劲的
You know, humans can really suck sometimes.

315
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:53,625
所以我们才要用外交手段
Which is why we have diplomacy.

316
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:56,695
化学武器后来被禁止了 地球上和平了
Chemical weapons have since been banned. Peace on Earth.

317
00:13:56,763 --> 00:13:58,096
如果化学武器已经被禁止了
So if chemicals have been banned,

318
00:13:58,165 --> 00:14:00,598
那我们这死者是怎么死的
how did our dead guy get dead?

319
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,400
因为它们还没有被全部销毁
Because they haven't all been destroyed yet.

320
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:05,570
销毁过程费钱又费时间
Destruction is expensive and slow.

321
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,872
美国的储备直到2023年才会被完全消除
The U.S. stockpile won't be eliminated until 2023,

322
00:14:07,941 --> 00:14:11,710
会花费大概500亿美元
at a cost of around $50 billion.

323
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:14,779
-但这还不是让人沮丧的部分 -这还不是
- But that's not the depressing part. - It's not?

324
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:17,115
化学武器还在被使用
Chemical weapons are still in use.

325
00:14:17,184 --> 00:14:19,150
一份联合国报告谴责叙利亚政府
A U.N. report condemned the Syrian government

326
00:14:19,219 --> 00:14:22,821
于去年向他们自己的人民投掷氯气炸弹
for dropping chlorine bombs on its own people last year,

327
00:14:22,923 --> 00:14:26,057
包括平民和儿童
including civilians and children.

328
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:30,261
我无法想象
I can't imagine.

329
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,764
我们能聊点愉快的事情吗
Can we talk about something happier?

330
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,467
哦
Oh.

331
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:41,639
噢 太好了 我们这个损毁严重的
Oh, yay. Fingerprints came back

332
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,075
神秘尸体的指纹结果出来了
on our grossly disfigured mystery body.

333
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:47,345
快乐到此为止了
So much for happier.

334
00:14:47,414 --> 00:14:50,615
我不敢相信Keenan死了
I can't believe Keenan's dead.

335
00:14:50,684 --> 00:14:52,183
Grant小姐  你和你弟弟
Miss Grant, uh, when was

336
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:53,852
最后一次谈话是在什么时候
the last time you spoke to your brother?

337
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,487
上周
Last week.

338
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:57,500
Keenan是我们家族里唯一一个
Keenan was the only one in our family who was actually

339
00:14:57,524 --> 00:14:58,790
实际上在做好事的人
on his way to making good,

340
00:14:58,859 --> 00:15:00,525
现在他这个蠢货赔上了性命
and now he got his stupid ass killed.

341
00:15:00,594 --> 00:15:02,627
-你怪罪你弟弟 -我就是在怪罪他
- You blame your brother. - You're damn right I do.

342
00:15:03,573 --> 00:15:07,866
妈妈死了之后 他向我保证不会丢下我独自一人
After Mom died, he promised me he wouldn't leave me alone.

343
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:10,268
我们想问你一些
We'd like to ask you a few questions

344
00:15:10,337 --> 00:15:12,270
关于他工作的问题 在
about his job at, uh...

345
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:13,339
他打两份工
He worked two jobs.

346
00:15:13,373 --> 00:15:15,039
他在我当厨师的那个
He was a busboy

347
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:16,828
鬼地方打杂 但是他的另一份工作
at the hellhole I cook at, but the other one

348
00:15:16,877 --> 00:15:19,210
是在一个好公司的不错的工作
was a good job at a nice company.

349
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,147
三源化学药剂销毁工厂
Trine Chemical Agent Destruction Plant.

350
00:15:22,215 --> 00:15:23,893
Keenan是我们家族里
Keenan was the only one in our family

351
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:26,284
唯一一个能通过他们要求的背景审查的人
who could actually pass the required background check.

352
00:15:26,353 --> 00:15:28,553
他从没有过犯罪记录
He never had a criminal record.

353
00:15:28,622 --> 00:15:32,357
我们认为他的工作可能和他的死亡有一定的关系
We think that his job might have something to do with his death.

354
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:34,670
-他是给他们开卡车的 -他提到过氯气吗
- He was driving trucks for them. - He ever mention chlorine?

355
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:36,572
他的工作包括处理危险的东西吗
Did his job include handling anything dangerous?

356
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:39,030
如果你想了解化学相关的 去和那家公司谈
If you want to know about chemicals, talk to the company.

357
00:15:39,099 --> 00:15:40,999
我们也在做 但是
We are. But...

358
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:42,834
Keenan没有把事情搞砸
Keenan didn't screw up.

359
00:15:44,471 --> 00:15:47,839
我可以指责我的弟弟 你们不能
I get to blame my baby brother. You don't.

360
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:52,010
这地方跟诺克斯堡似得
<i>This place is like Fort Knox.</i>

361
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:54,412
当然 化学物品也可能和黄金一样值钱
Well, chemicals can be just as valuable as gold.

362
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:56,347
当然也更加危险
Certainly more dangerous.

363
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,584
我在想是谁在看着 看到那个了吗
I wonder who's watching. See there?

364
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:01,386
你好 打扰一下
Hi. Excuse me.

365
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:03,254
你们一定是NCIS的人了
You must be NCIS.

366
00:16:03,323 --> 00:16:06,591
抱歉来的太晚了 我是一路穿过整个厂区走过来的
My apologies for being so late. I was all the way across campus.

367
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,893
而且 他们给了我们这种高尔夫球车
And, uh, they give us these golf carts,

368
00:16:08,962 --> 00:16:12,530
但为什么要浪费能源呢 对吧 我是Patton Hartgrave博士
but why waste the energy, right? Dr. Patton Hartgrave.

369
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:14,833
你好 也是三源的首席化学工程师
Hi. Trine's lead chemical engineer.

370
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:16,434
那么
So...

371
00:16:16,503 --> 00:16:17,936
抱歉
Excuse me.

372
00:16:18,004 --> 00:16:19,904
如果你们不担心看上去显得太笨的话
If you, uh, aren't afraid to look too dorky,

373
00:16:19,973 --> 00:16:21,372
我可以带你参观一下
I could show you around.

374
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:24,008
我绝不可能看上去笨笨的
It's impossible for me to look dorky.

375
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:26,444
你说是就是吧
Right.

376
00:16:26,513 --> 00:16:29,914
这里就是见证奇迹的地方
So this is where the magic happens.

377
00:16:29,983 --> 00:16:34,052
我们用两种方式处理有害的化学品
We dispose of harmful chemicals two ways: incineration

378
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,888
焚烧和中和 混入其他试剂
and neutralization, mixing in other agents

379
00:16:36,957 --> 00:16:38,723
来消除毒性
to eliminate toxicity.

380
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:41,759
都是非常有效 非常安全的
It's all very effective, very safe.

381
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:43,628
这也意味着昂贵的花费
Which means it's very expensive.

382
00:16:43,697 --> 00:16:46,264
我向你保证每一分钱都是值得的
Well, I can assure you it's worth every penny.

383
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,466
Keenan Grant在哪儿工作
Where did Keenan Grant work?

384
00:16:50,203 --> 00:16:52,136
好吧
Right.

385
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:55,540
这个 这个是Grant先生的储物柜
This is, uh... this is Mr. Grant's locker.

386
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:58,376
我和他本人不熟
I didn't know him personally,

387
00:16:58,445 --> 00:17:00,812
但是当然了 我们听到了发生的事情时都很震惊
but of course, we're all very shocked to hear what happened.

388
00:17:00,881 --> 00:17:02,580
两个晚上之前他在工作吗
Was he working two nights ago?

389
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:04,482
呃 让我们看看
Uh, let's see.

390
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:09,554
实际上 我有权查看那些记录
Actually, I have access to those records.

391
00:17:09,623 --> 00:17:12,323
呣
Mm...

392
00:17:12,392 --> 00:17:16,327
哦 是的 看起来他那天晚上是在工作
Uh, yes. It looks like he was working that night.

393
00:17:16,396 --> 00:17:19,764
是去特区的佛蒙特旅馆取货
It was a single pickup at the Freemont Inn in D.C.

394
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,299
那里也是他的尸体被发现的地方
That's where his body was found.

395
00:17:21,368 --> 00:17:23,568
他是要去取什么货
What was he picking up?

396
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:26,070
一些用于再循环的工业塑料
Some industrial plastic for recycling.

397
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:27,672
不是什么危险品
It's nothing too dangerous.

398
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:31,075
是酒店的垃圾 又不是去切尔诺贝利
It's hotel waste, not Chernobyl, which...

399
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:34,646
那是个没人当回事的生态警示
was an ecological warning sign nobody took seriously enough.

400
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:36,748
你作为一个化学家似乎
You seem very, uh, Earth-friendly

401
00:17:36,816 --> 00:17:38,483
很关心地球生态保护
for a chemical guy.

402
00:17:38,551 --> 00:17:42,420
嘿 我只是在纠正人类犯下的一些最糟的错误之一
Hey, I'm just correcting some of mankind's worst mistakes.

403
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:44,122
比如销毁氯气
Like destroying chlorine gas.

404
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,491
那时不可能的
That's impossible.

405
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,862
噢 呃 McGee探员和Torres探员 这位是George Ashley Green
Oh, uh, Agents McGee and Torres, this is George Ashley Green,

406
00:17:50,931 --> 00:17:52,497
我们无畏的领导
our fearless leader.

407
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:55,133
而且也是三源化学的首席执行官
Well, CEO of Trine Chemical, anyway.

408
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:57,001
我刚好看到你们两个进来了
I happened to see you two come in.

409
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,636
我就知道有人在盯着
I knew somebody was watching.

410
00:17:58,705 --> 00:18:00,625
为什么毁掉氯气是不可能的
Why is destroying chlorine gas impossible?

411
00:18:00,674 --> 00:18:03,775
因为我们多年都没有氯气了
Because we haven't had any for years.

412
00:18:03,843 --> 00:18:05,877
按照之前每次的军事合同
It was all destroyed per previous

413
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:07,045
都全部处理掉了
military contracts.

414
00:18:07,113 --> 00:18:08,157
当前的合同呢
What about current contracts?

415
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:09,948
没有和氯气相关的
None, for chlorine.

416
00:18:10,016 --> 00:18:12,951
但没有许可我也只能说这么多了
But that's all I can really say without clearance.

417
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:14,552
这关乎国家安全
National security concerns.

418
00:18:14,621 --> 00:18:15,987
你能理解的
You understand.

419
00:18:16,056 --> 00:18:17,555
我需要五角大楼的批准
I need permission from the Pentagon.

420
00:18:22,295 --> 00:18:23,561
嘿 Bishop 说
Hey, Bishop. Go.

421
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,941
国防部又在
The DoD is pushing

422
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:27,131
推迟你的会面时间了
your meeting time, again.

423
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,466
实际上 他们取消了会见
Actually, they cancelled

424
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:30,068
并且建议你明天再来
and suggested you come back tomorrow.

425
00:18:30,136 --> 00:18:31,803
噢 不 不 不 不
Oh, no. No, no, no.

426
00:18:31,871 --> 00:18:33,805
在得到一些答复之前我是不会走的
I'm not going anywhere until I get some answers.

427
00:18:33,873 --> 00:18:35,551
我跟他们也是这么说的 但他们一直重复
That's what I told them, but they kept citing

428
00:18:35,575 --> 00:18:38,676
这关乎国家安全而不说什么详情
"national security concerns" without any details.

429
00:18:38,745 --> 00:18:40,378
呃 Bishop
Uh, Bishop?

430
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:42,714
我之后再联系你
I'll call you back.

431
00:18:43,984 --> 00:18:45,750
下午好
Good afternoon.

432
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:47,085
特别探员Gibbs 对吗
Special Agent Gibbs, right?

433
00:18:47,153 --> 00:18:48,820
Wynn Crawford
Wynn Crawford.

434
00:18:48,888 --> 00:18:50,021
-是的 先生 -我刚和海军部长
- Yes, sir. - I just got done

435
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,223
聊过你的队伍
talking about your team with SECNAV.

436
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:55,026
她讲了不少关于你的故事 都是好事
She had quite a few stories about you, all good.

437
00:18:55,095 --> 00:18:57,028
-我想也是 -关于你的会面
- I'll bet. - About your meeting...

438
00:18:57,097 --> 00:18:58,596
-呃 被取消了 -是我取消的
- Uh, it was cancelled. - By me.

439
00:18:58,665 --> 00:18:59,945
但既然你在这里了 我想
But since you're here, I figured

440
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,310
我还是当面告诉你这个坏消息吧
I'd give you the bad news in person.

441
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:03,401
五角大楼的记录已经被临时封锁了
Pentagon records have been temporarily locked.

442
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,636
-被你封锁的 -不 是政府部门
- By you. - No, by State.

443
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:07,216
他们目前正在和联合国合作
They're currently working with the U.N.

444
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,073
达成关于叙利亚的停火协议
on a cease-fire agreement in Syria.

445
00:19:09,142 --> 00:19:11,542
你的请求传递出了危险信息
Your requests sent up red flags.

446
00:19:11,611 --> 00:19:14,412
化学武器的调查让人们很紧张
Chemical weapons investigations make people nervous.

447
00:19:14,481 --> 00:19:16,047
化学袭击也一样
So do chemical attacks.

448
00:19:16,116 --> 00:19:17,749
没错 你瞧 这正是我们
Yeah, see, that's exactly

449
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:20,184
无法承担的不计后果的谈话
the kind of reckless talk that we can't afford.

450
00:19:20,253 --> 00:19:21,519
现在 你有证据表明存在
Now, do you have proof

451
00:19:21,588 --> 00:19:22,588
有预期的恐怖主义活动吗
of intended terrorism?

452
00:19:22,655 --> 00:19:24,022
还是有武器失踪
Or missing weapons?

453
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,590
你让找证据变得困难了
You're making it hard to find proof.

454
00:19:25,658 --> 00:19:27,737
那你就换种方式找证据 我会很高兴提供帮助的
Well, find a different way, and I'll be happy to help.

455
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:30,228
我想为你们的受害者寻求正义
I want justice for your victim.

456
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:32,063
但是陆战队员之间 我说个真话
But Marine to Marine?

457
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:35,233
世界舞台上 这会儿还有很多更大的事情正在发生
There are a lot bigger things at play here on the world stage.

458
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:37,435
我们可以两者兼顾的 部长先生
We can do both, Mr. Secretary.

459
00:19:37,504 --> 00:19:40,872
我说这些只是出于礼貌 而不是跟你讨价还价
This was a courtesy, not a negotiation.

460
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,774
现在 除非NCIS
Now, unless NCIS

461
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:47,745
有确凿证据证明武器失踪了 我说的是真正意义上的武器
has concrete evidence of missing weapons-- actual weapons--

462
00:19:47,814 --> 00:19:49,580
否则 你们就要停止行动
you will stand down.

463
00:19:51,217 --> 00:19:53,151
这是命令
That's an order.

464
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,661
所以 Gibbs把我让你们停止行动的命令
So, Gibbs told you about my order

465
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,164
告诉了你们 然而你们依然没有服从
to stand down, and you still failed to follow it.

466
00:20:06,232 --> 00:20:09,000
我自己也经常不同意Gibbs的做法 长官
I don't always agree with Gibbs myself, sir,

467
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:10,935
但是我相信他的判断
but I do trust his judgment,

468
00:20:11,004 --> 00:20:13,738
还有我NCIS的同事们的判断
and the judgment of my people here at NCIS.

469
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:14,784
如果他们没有服从你的命令 那是因为
If they didn't follow your order, it's because

470
00:20:14,808 --> 00:20:16,441
确实有武器失踪了
there are missing weapons.

471
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:18,776
而这个坐在审讯室里的化学工程师
And the chemical engineer sitting in interrogation...

472
00:20:18,845 --> 00:20:20,812
-他会告诉我们一切吗 -继续看
- Can tell us everything? - Keep watching.

473
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,413
我的人知道怎么击溃他
My people know how to break this guy.

474
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:24,282
我什么都不说
I'm not saying a word,

475
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,616
所以要么逮捕我 要么放我走
so just arrest me or be done.

476
00:20:25,685 --> 00:20:26,851
很抱歉
I'm sorry,

477
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,286
我们耽误你什么事儿了吗
are we keeping you from something?

478
00:20:28,354 --> 00:20:29,687
你还有约会什么的吗
Hot date, maybe?

479
00:20:36,763 --> 00:20:38,763
哦 天哪
Oh, God!

480
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:41,866
露馅了
Cat's out of the bag.

481
00:20:41,935 --> 00:20:45,169
我想你们可以说我跟大地母亲有个约会
Guess you could say my hot date's with Mother Earth.

482
00:20:45,238 --> 00:20:46,704
约会地点是地下的棺材里面
Six feet under.

483
00:20:46,773 --> 00:20:48,306
你之前被暴露在毒气中了
You were exposed to the gas.

484
00:20:48,374 --> 00:20:51,142
剂量不多 但是足够致死了
Not much, but enough.

485
00:20:53,246 --> 00:20:56,314
我会在你们逼我交代之前死掉
I'll be dead before you can get me to talk.

486
00:20:56,382 --> 00:20:57,448
我去拿急救箱
I'll get the kit.

487
00:20:57,517 --> 00:20:58,883
抱歉
Sorry.

488
00:20:58,952 --> 00:21:01,018
我猜 NCIS已经没什么能做的了
Well, I guess NCIS is done here.

489
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:13,350
你需要医疗救护
You need medical attention.

490
00:21:13,374 --> 00:21:14,607
我们正在呼叫医疗人员
We're calling the paramedics.

491
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:16,020
不 已经太晚了
No, no, no, it's too late for that.

492
00:21:16,044 --> 00:21:17,676
我说过我不想接受急救
I told you I don't want that.

493
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:19,512
这个人正在咳血
The fact that this man is coughing up blood

494
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,147
这就意味着我们是对的
means that we are right.

495
00:21:21,215 --> 00:21:23,449
长官 现在依然有很多遗失的氯气
Sir, there is missing chlorine gas,

496
00:21:23,518 --> 00:21:24,850
这个人知道氯气在哪
and this man knows where it is.

497
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:27,787
你们又是怎么发现的
And you found this out how?

498
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:30,322
你们好像忘记了故事里面
You seem to have forgotten the part of the story

499
00:21:30,391 --> 00:21:32,031
你们俩违反了联邦法律的部分
where you two committed a federal offense.

500
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,500
实际上 如果我不了解情况的话
In fact, if I didn't know any better,

501
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:35,327
我会说你们是在故意拖延时间
I'd say you're deliberately stalling.

502
00:21:35,396 --> 00:21:37,563
-完全没有 -不可能
- Not at all. - No way.

503
00:21:37,632 --> 00:21:40,466
约会习惯 短信息 免费的小玩意儿
Dating habits, text messages, free gadgets.

504
00:21:40,535 --> 00:21:42,902
这些难道是你们NCIS的工作日常吗
These are all essential to your work here at NCIS?

505
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,638
实际上 没错
Actually, yeah.

506
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:47,506
-嘿 Nick -怎么了
- Hey, Nick. - What up?

507
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:50,409
是你取消了我昨晚的约会吗
Did you cancel my date last night?

508
00:21:50,478 --> 00:21:51,544
早上好
Good morning.

509
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:53,245
我昨晚应该出去约会的
I was supposed to have a date last night,

510
00:21:53,314 --> 00:21:56,982
但是据Boyd所说 我把约会取消了
but according to Boyd, I cancelled it.

511
00:21:57,051 --> 00:21:58,551
你没跟我商量
You sent a message

512
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:00,753
-就发了信息 -Gibbs当时就站在那里
- without telling me. - Gibbs was standing right there.

513
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:01,865
你想让我怎么做 让你陷入麻烦吗
What do you want me to do, let you get in trouble?

514
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:04,090
就为了条信息吗
For getting a text message?

515
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:05,424
这根本说不过去
That doesn't make any sense.

516
00:22:05,493 --> 00:22:07,026
他甚至不知道信息是谁发的
He didn't even know who it was from.

517
00:22:07,095 --> 00:22:08,594
没错 而且他对这事儿没兴趣
Yeah, he didn't care, either.

518
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:10,463
五角大楼的记录 什么情况了
Pentagon records. Go.

519
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:13,199
我们依然没有访问文件的许可
Well, we still don't have permission to access files.

520
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:15,367
要想找到失踪的武器
In order to find missing chemical weapons,

521
00:22:15,436 --> 00:22:17,081
我们得黑进五角大楼
we're gonna have to hack into the Pentagon,

522
00:22:17,105 --> 00:22:18,504
而这有点小风险
which is a little risky.

523
00:22:18,573 --> 00:22:20,005
还是违法的
And a lot illegal.

524
00:22:20,074 --> 00:22:21,874
-另找个方法 -我们可能有另外的办法了
- Find a different way. - We may already have.

525
00:22:21,943 --> 00:22:24,910
退而求其次的话 Torres和我能查到另外的文件
Torres and I are able to access the next best thing.

526
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:27,046
Trine化学公司自己的记录
Records to Trine Chemical itself.

527
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:30,416
额 等等 Nick帮你搞黑客行动吗
Uh, I'm sorry. Nick is helping you hack?

528
00:22:30,485 --> 00:22:31,417
当然了
Hell yeah.

529
00:22:31,486 --> 00:22:32,885
-嗯 -当然 是用我的方式
- Hmm. - Well, in my own way.

530
00:22:32,954 --> 00:22:35,332
这里有一个隐藏摄像头 在那个公司里的时候
There was a hidden camera, and it was recording the entire time

531
00:22:35,356 --> 00:22:37,401
-全程进行了录像 -其中包括了Hartgrave
- while we were at the company. - Including when Hartgrave

532
00:22:37,425 --> 00:22:40,126
-输入他管理员密码的时候 -只是意外而已
-entered his admin password. - It was by accident.

533
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:42,005
弗吉尼亚州是一个一致同意允许录像的州
Virginia is a one-party consent state for recording.

534
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,429
你追踪到他的按键动作了吗
You tracked his keystrokes?

535
00:22:43,498 --> 00:22:45,965
我们确实有一个跟我们受害者 Keenan Grant有关的
We do have a warrant for security records

536
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:47,733
允许查看安全记录的搜查令
pertaining to our victim, Keenan Grant.

537
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:50,870
这可不包括化学武器记录
Which doesn't cover records of chemical weapons.

538
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:52,972
-所以我不会下载那些记录 -不会故意下载
- So we don't download those. -On purpose.

539
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,142
那国防部长关于停止行动的命令呢
What about SecDef's order to stand down?

540
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,576
老大
Boss?

541
00:22:59,147 --> 00:23:00,412
做吧 McGee
Do it, McGee.

542
00:23:03,184 --> 00:23:04,795
好的 我建议你尽快下载
All right, well, I suggest you download as much as you can

543
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:06,152
尽量多的信息
as fast as you can.

544
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,319
为什么
Why?

545
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:08,866
一个规模这么大的公司会有追踪
A company this big has security protocols

546
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,156
外部IP的安全协议
tracing outside IPs.

547
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:11,957
所以我编了一个程序
Which is why I created a program

548
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:13,993
来警告我
that'll alert me if I...

549
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,461
哦
Ooh.

550
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,965
警告我我被追踪了
Alert me if I'm being traced.

551
00:23:20,034 --> 00:23:21,901
-他们找到你了吗 -问错了问题
- Did they find you? - Wrong question.

552
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:23,135
你拿到文件了吗
Did you get the file?

553
00:23:23,204 --> 00:23:24,737
幸运的是 我成功地
Well, luckily, I was able to

554
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:26,972
对下载直接进行了安全备份
directly download to a secure backup.

555
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,074
只需要找台电脑打开它
Just need someone's computer to open it.

556
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:31,944
那是我们的受害者
There's our victim

557
00:23:32,013 --> 00:23:34,280
他死亡的那天夜里
the night of his death.

558
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:35,781
他那天晚上在工作
He was working that night.

559
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,450
等一下 我们的科学家也在那里
Hold up. So was our scientist.

560
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,919
他跟我们撒了谎
He lied to us.

561
00:23:39,987 --> 00:23:42,521
为什么首席工程师随便上了一个卡车
Why would the lead engineer go on a random pickup?

562
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,157
除非那个卡车上有什么非常重要的东西
Unless there was something very valuable on that truck.

563
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:47,593
-比如氯气 -Hartgrave是凶手吗
- Like chlorine? - Is Hartgrave our killer?

564
00:23:47,662 --> 00:23:50,162
是时候问一下了 我去找Gibbs
It's time to ask. I'll get Gibbs.

565
00:23:50,231 --> 00:23:51,263
没必要
No need.

566
00:23:51,332 --> 00:23:53,365
主任
Director.

567
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:55,601
Gibbs
Gibbs.

568
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,214
我刚接到Trine化学公司的电话
I just received a call from Trine Chemical.

569
00:23:57,238 --> 00:24:00,539
实际上 打电话的是他们的网络安全部门
Their cyber security department, actually.

570
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:05,678
NCIS有没有犯下非法进行黑客行为的重罪
Did NCIS just participate in a felony by hacking?

571
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:09,048
额 这更像是法律的灰色地带  长官
It's, uh, it's more of a gray area, sir.

572
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,487
这可不好
This is bad.

573
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:16,934
Torres和McGee应该干些什么
What are Torres and McGee supposed to do?

574
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,490
陈述事实
Tell the truth.

575
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,392
这很糟 对吧
Yeah, that's bad, right?

576
00:24:20,461 --> 00:24:22,027
Hartgrave 他在哪
Hartgrave. Where is he?

577
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:24,007
根据公司保安的说法 他刚刚打卡进去了
According to company security, he just clocked in.

578
00:24:24,031 --> 00:24:25,497
好的 我们走
Okay, let's go.

579
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:28,167
好吧 也许没那么糟
Okay. Maybe it's not that bad.

580
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:33,973
那是国防部长
That's the United States Secretary of Defense.

581
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,975
-我们走 -他现在提供上门服务了吗
- Let's go. - He's making house calls now?

582
00:24:37,245 --> 00:24:39,345
这很糟
Yeah. It's bad.

583
00:24:40,915 --> 00:24:42,648
然后就是现在的处境了
Which brings us to now.

584
00:24:42,717 --> 00:24:44,817
所以 就像你看到的
So, as you can see,

585
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:48,354
那个科学家在是否在现场和毒气的事情上撒了谎
our scientist lied about being there and the gas.

586
00:24:48,422 --> 00:24:51,090
是的 没错 我看见了
Yes. Yes, I do see.

587
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:53,158
我还看到应该要求Gibbs探员应该为
I also see the need to ask for Agent Gibbs' badge

588
00:24:53,261 --> 00:24:55,761
允许他的探员们违反多项法律交出他的徽章
for allowing his agents to break so many laws.

589
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,763
NCIS有搜查令 长官
NCIS had a warrant, sir.

590
00:24:57,832 --> 00:25:01,333
而且担心走传统程序去接近Hartgrave的话 他会
And a reasonable fear that Hartgrave could alter records

591
00:25:01,402 --> 00:25:03,102
篡改记录 这个担心非常合理
if traditionally approached.

592
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,037
所以 这是个精明的电脑策略
Hence the shrewd computer tactics.

593
00:25:05,106 --> 00:25:06,839
-没错 -是的 就像他说的
- Exactly. - Yeah, what he said.

594
00:25:06,907 --> 00:25:08,674
你们窃取政府记录
You stole government records.

595
00:25:08,743 --> 00:25:10,609
我们证明了Hartgrave确实在那里
We proved that Hartgrave was there.

596
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:13,178
就在一切开始的地方 跟失踪的氯气在一起
At ground zero, with the missing chlorine.

597
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:15,581
我们必须假设 它会被用来进行袭击
We have to assume it's going to be used for an attack.

598
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,516
长官 这个人知道所有细节
Sir, this guy knows all the details.

599
00:25:17,585 --> 00:25:19,084
NCIS能够击垮他
NCIS is going to break him.

600
00:25:19,153 --> 00:25:20,753
我们是需要更多的时间
We just need more time.

601
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:25,524
说得太对了
Damn Skippy.

602
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:27,971
急救人员在路上了
Medical's on the way.

603
00:25:27,995 --> 00:25:30,029
我不要他们的帮忙
I won't accept their help.

604
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:33,432
为什么 Patton
Why not, Patton?

605
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:35,200
因为羞愧
Is it shame?

606
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:36,535
还是有负罪感
Guilt?

607
00:25:36,604 --> 00:25:37,870
有人死了
A man's dead.

608
00:25:37,938 --> 00:25:38,938
而你在这里
And you were there.

609
00:25:39,974 --> 00:25:41,073
我们知道你在受害人死的那个晚上
We have you with the victim

610
00:25:41,142 --> 00:25:42,486
和他一起
the night of his death and at the hotel

611
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,742
待在发现他尸体的酒店
where his body was found.

612
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:46,078
他发现了你偷氯气 是吗
He found out you stole the chlorine, right?

613
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:47,313
-你杀了他 -不是的
- You killed him. - No.

614
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:49,415
我
I...

615
00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:51,583
"我"怎么了 说完啊
"I..." Come on, finish the sentence.

616
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:52,785
我是凶手
"I am a murderer."

617
00:25:54,188 --> 00:25:56,422
快点 对你所做的事负责
Aw, come on, man. Own it.

618
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,957
Keenan的死是个意外
Keenan's death was an accident.

619
00:25:59,026 --> 00:26:00,159
我试着救他
I tried to save him.

620
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:01,894
-在发现你的时候吗 -是的
- That's when you were exposed? - Yes.

621
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:04,963
我想要安全地卸下氯
I was going to unload the chlorine safely...

622
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:06,032
从卡车上吗
From the truck?

623
00:26:06,067 --> 00:26:07,333
我不可能
It's not like I could

624
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:08,901
把我的车开到装卸码头
back my car up to the loading dock.

625
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:11,904
但是
But, uh...

626
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:14,840
我们到了酒店后 Keenan发现了那个箱子
...when we got to the hotel, Keenan, he found the crate

627
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:16,508
他打开了 我来不及阻止
and opened it before I could stop him.

628
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:18,344
他的撬棍肯定滑落了 或者
His crowbar must have slipped, or--

629
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:21,146
当我关闭阀门时，他已经死了
He was dead by the time I closed the valve.

630
00:26:21,215 --> 00:26:23,349
你看到了医学遗体 把他的尸体藏到这中间
You saw the medical cadavers and hid the body.

631
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:24,983
等等
Wait,

632
00:26:25,052 --> 00:26:29,088
那个好人在完成自己的工作
a good man was doing his job,

633
00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:30,289
而你却没有负罪感吗
and you don't feel guilt?

634
00:26:30,358 --> 00:26:32,791
我有 在那件事上
I do, about that.

635
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,327
但是偷能杀死无数人的化学武器
Oh, but stealing barbaric chemical weapons

636
00:26:35,396 --> 00:26:37,363
就没什么问题吗
that could kill hundreds, you're cool with that?

637
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,098
偷 是啊 你怎么能够偷
Steal. Right. How can you <i>steal</i>

638
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,966
根本不在我们记录上的东西呢
something that wasn't even in our records?

639
00:26:41,035 --> 00:26:43,435
我在仓库里发现了这些罐子
I found the canisters in the vault.

640
00:26:43,504 --> 00:26:44,504
并且拿走了它们
And <i>took</i> them.

641
00:26:44,572 --> 00:26:46,004
他们不会错过它的
They weren't gonna miss it.

642
00:26:46,073 --> 00:26:48,207
氯气在哪里
Where's the gas?

643
00:26:49,543 --> 00:26:51,944
我想要相信
You know, I wanted to believe that

644
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:53,645
我在为世界上的许多错误
I was doing my part

645
00:26:53,714 --> 00:26:57,716
做出一些平和的改正
to peacefully right a few wrongs in this world.

646
00:26:57,785 --> 00:26:59,718
这不够
It wasn't enough.

647
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:01,687
恶魔不停进攻
Evil plays offense.

648
00:27:01,756 --> 00:27:04,156
是啊 现在你也是这样了
Right. So now you are, too.

649
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:05,991
不是我
Not me.

650
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,396
不是我 是受到政府氯气威胁的市民们
No, the citizens being gassed by their own government.

651
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,965
他们需要一种强大的武器
They need a weapon just as strong.

652
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:16,168
我们将阿富汗人武装起来去对抗俄罗斯人 不是吗
We armed the Afghans against the Russians, right?

653
00:27:16,237 --> 00:27:18,404
或者是80年代尼加拉瓜叛乱中的)反桑地诺主义者
Or what about the Contras in the '80s?

654
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:19,472
氯气在哪里
Where is the gas?!

655
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,007
在送给自由战士的路上
On its way to freedom fighters.

656
00:27:22,076 --> 00:27:24,410
他们知道我想要完成的事情
They understand what I'm trying to accomplish.

657
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:27,846
你看过那些孩子死亡的视频吗
Have you seen the videos of those kids dying?

658
00:27:27,915 --> 00:27:29,648
请听我说
Please listen to me.

659
00:27:29,717 --> 00:27:31,717
你认为的高尚会导致
Your supposed nobility is gonna get

660
00:27:31,786 --> 00:27:33,719
更多人的死亡 -不会的
a lot more people killed. - No.

661
00:27:33,788 --> 00:27:36,422
不会的 一旦到了叙利亚
No, the gas will be in good hands...

662
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,856
会有人保管好它们
...once it gets to Syria.

663
00:27:37,925 --> 00:27:39,858
恐怖组织的成员
Members of terrorist organizations

664
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:42,561
知道你加入了自由战士
have been known to join your freedom fighters

665
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,364
来获得情报或者偷得武器
to gain Intel or to steal weapons.

666
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:47,043
你不知道这些气体会用在哪里 是吗
You don't know where the gas will end up, do you?

667
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:49,045
关于这些东西的消息传得到处都是
Word about these kind of things gets around.

668
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:50,436
坏人从暗中出现
Bad guys come out of the woodwork.

669
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:54,573
不是的 事情已经发生了
No. What's done is done.

670
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,509
你有什么想法 Ellie
I hope you have some ideas, Ellie.

671
00:27:57,578 --> 00:27:58,789
我不知道该怎么接近他
I don't know how to reach this guy.

672
00:27:58,813 --> 00:28:00,078
他会承认一切
Well, he'll admit to everything,

673
00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:01,246
但不会放弃气体
but won't give up the gas.

674
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:02,247
你不能和疯子争执
You can't argue with crazy.

675
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:03,449
他不是个疯子
Oh, he's not crazy.

676
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:04,583
他有原则
He's principled.

677
00:28:04,652 --> 00:28:06,084
他就是这么认为的
That's how he sees it.

678
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:08,220
他上一次行动完全就是正义的
His last act on earth is totally righteous.

679
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:10,923
除非那不是 不过那时他就会死了
Until it's not, but by then, he'll be dead.

680
00:28:10,991 --> 00:28:12,925
我们需要更多的时间
We need more time.

681
00:28:14,762 --> 00:28:17,396
不行 没有更多时间了 主任
No, no more time, Director.

682
00:28:17,465 --> 00:28:18,797
外面有遗失的气体
There's missing gas out there.

683
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,799
长官 我们一直在说这个
Sir, that's what we've been saying.

684
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:22,179
更有理由把这件事尽快交给国土安全部
All the more reason to turn it over to Homeland

685
00:28:22,203 --> 00:28:23,936
和FBI处理了
and the FBI as soon as possible.

686
00:28:24,004 --> 00:28:26,116
对于Gibbs探员和他的队伍来说
As far as Agent Gibbs and his team are concerned,

687
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,473
他们将在法庭上度过一天
they'll get their day in court.

688
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:29,541
-我们会小心行事的 -我才
- We'll be discreet. - I don't give a damn

689
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,743
不关心出镜这件事 长官
about appearances, sir.

690
00:28:31,812 --> 00:28:33,445
化学武器流落在外
There are chemical weapons out there.

691
00:28:33,514 --> 00:28:35,414
你却要浪费时间交接案子
And you want to waste time transferring the case

692
00:28:35,483 --> 00:28:38,116
主要嫌犯还在我们面前
when the lead suspect is-- is right in front of us.

693
00:28:38,185 --> 00:28:39,963
-记者会马上要开始了 -我有个注意
- That press conference is ready to begin. - I have an idea.

Crawford部长 你正在犯一个大错误
Secretary Crawford, you are making a big mistake.

696
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:44,891
正是我想的那样
That's what I was thinking.

697
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:48,260
你是对的 错误就是在这里浪费时间
You're right, but the mistake is wasting time in here.

698
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,950
Torres探员 你究竟在做些什么
Agent Torres, what the hell are you doing?

699
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,913
对啊 你在做什么
Yeah, what are you doing?

700
00:29:07,982 --> 00:29:10,516
等等 那不是你的主意吗
Wait, this wasn't your idea?

701
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:12,251
不是 我的主意是系统验证模式
No, SCIF mode was my idea.

702
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,964
那你为什么看着我放在桌上的枪
Then why did you look at my gun on the table?

703
00:29:13,988 --> 00:29:15,320
我没看你的枪
I wasn't looking at your gun.

704
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:17,422
Vance主任
Director Vance,

705
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:18,991
你的探员们是在威胁
are your agents threatening

706
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:21,026
美国国防部长吗
the United States Secretary of Defense?

707
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:26,431
我当然不希望是这样的
I certainly hope not.

708
00:29:36,353 --> 00:29:39,888
你挟持我每多20分钟
I figure every 20 minutes you hold me hostage,

709
00:29:39,956 --> 00:29:41,823
你的徒刑就会增加一年
there's another year on your sentence.

710
00:29:41,892 --> 00:29:44,893
是吗 等等 挟持
Huh? Wait, what? Hostage?

711
00:29:44,961 --> 00:29:45,908
那就是你做的事 不是吗
Well, that's what you're doing, isn't it?

712
00:29:45,932 --> 00:29:46,795
不不不
No. No, no, no.

713
00:29:46,796 --> 00:29:47,962
不是
Not at all.

714
00:29:48,031 --> 00:29:50,899
系统验证模式切断了手机信号
Well, SCIF mode cuts cell service...

715
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:51,900
而你又装备了武器
and you're armed.

716
00:29:51,968 --> 00:29:54,135
哦 这个啊
Oh-- Oh, this?

717
00:29:54,204 --> 00:29:56,237

我们只是要求多点时间 长官
Yeah, we-we're merely asking for more time, sir.

719
00:29:58,441 --> 00:30:01,342
你们的嫌犯不会再说什么了 他已经明确了
Your suspect isn't gonna talk. He's made that quite clear.

720
00:30:01,411 --> 00:30:04,345
我告诉过你们 我不需要医疗救助
I told you, I don't want any medical help.

721
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,719

Y-You keep me informed.

730
00:30:44,654 --> 00:30:46,788
发生什么了
Hey. What's-what's going on?

731
00:30:46,856 --> 00:30:48,790
出什么事了
Is something wrong?

732
00:30:51,795 --> 00:30:53,728
当局赶到现场

Metro bomb squad and Hazmat teams have entered the building.

734
00:30:56,833 --> 00:31:00,234
联邦当局刚发布了官方声明
While federal authorities have yet to issue a formal statement,

735
00:31:00,303 --> 00:31:03,071
警方要求特区地区的市民
police are asking everyone in the greater D.C. area

736
00:31:03,139 --> 00:31:04,939
呆在家中

737
00:31:05,008 --> 00:31:07,442
你的气体被用在了袭击事件中
Your gas was used in an attack.

738
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,645
这是WJGZ节目先前收到的
Again, here is the footage WJGZ received earlier,

739
00:31:10,714 --> 00:31:12,280
用手机拍摄的视频
taken with a cell phone.

740
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:15,116
这段视频年龄较小的观众不宜观看
This video may not be suitable for younger viewers.

741
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,266
快走 快走 快走
Go, go, go!

742
00:31:32,335 --> 00:31:35,236
不 这说不通
No. This doesn't make any sense.

743
00:31:35,305 --> 00:31:37,572
-当然说不通 -这是恐怖袭击
- Of course it doesn't. - It's terrorism!

744
00:31:37,641 --> 00:31:38,851
这说明你的上个行动
Which means your last act on Earth

745
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:40,219
会杀死无辜民众
will be the killing of innocent people.

746
00:31:40,243 --> 00:31:41,843
那和你的基石相符吗
Think that'll fit on your headstone?

747
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:44,278
-我是信的 -不不 那不是
- I'll make sure it does. - No, no. That's not...

748

那不是我
That's-that's not what I...

749
00:31:45,395 --> 00:31:47,395
那你再找出个人来让我们责备
Well, then, you give me someone else to blame!

750
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:51,185
我把箱子给了一个海关探员
Uh, okay, uh, I-I gave the crate to a customs agent.

751
00:31:51,254 --> 00:31:52,920
地址
Address.

752
00:31:52,989 --> 00:31:55,323
他不知道里面有什么
Uh, he didn't know what was inside.

753
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,824
他一定打开过
He must have opened it.

754
00:32:01,498 --> 00:32:02,930
Leon 那是我想的那样吧
Leon, is this what I think it is?

755
00:32:11,408 --> 00:32:13,374
我要完蛋了
I'll be damned.

756
00:32:17,013 --> 00:32:18,893
-我已获知... -闭路电视5频道
-I'm now being told... - Closed circuit, channel five.

757
00:32:18,948 --> 00:32:20,860
酒店已经被疏散 紧急救援部门

758
00:32:20,884 --> 00:32:23,551
正继续在该地展开...

759
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,187
嘿 呃 谢谢你 Ross先生
Hey, uh, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Ross,

760
00:32:26,256 --> 00:32:27,522
不过你可以不用读了
but you can stop reading now.

761
00:32:32,862 --> 00:32:37,331
呃 稿子到这里结束了 所以我即兴创作了最后一段
The, uh, script ended, so I improvised that last part.

762
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,111
-我希望没啥问题 -Bishop探员给我发了消息
- I hope that was okay. - Agent Bishop texted me.

763
00:32:39,135 --> 00:32:40,334

You were perfect.

764
00:32:40,403 --> 00:32:43,971

非常感谢你允许我
Thank you so much for allowing me

766
00:32:45,442 --> 00:32:46,886
成为你们军事演习的一部分

767
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:50,311
我 我得说 这对我来说是个全新的任务
I, uh, have to say, this was a new one for me.

768
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,013
是啊 对我们来说也是
Yeah. Us, too.

769
00:32:52,082 --> 00:32:54,048
Hines小姐 这个广播节目
Miss Hines, this broadcast

770
00:32:54,117 --> 00:32:56,818
只通过闭路电视播出了 对吗
was only sent via closed circuit, right?

771
00:32:56,886 --> 00:32:59,187
-是的 只在我们大楼里 主任 -那些镜头

探员们愿意提供帮助
at the seminar, they were happy to help.

774
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,261
我们告诉他们这是一个 执法舆情学 的演练
We told them it was an exercise in "Optics In Law Enforcement."

775
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,163
尸体都是真的尸体
And the bodies were the cadavers.

776
00:33:09,232 --> 00:33:10,865
并不是那样 长官
Not exactly, sir,

777
00:33:10,934 --> 00:33:13,668
不过我喜欢你那么想
but I like where your head is at.

778
00:33:14,804 --> 00:33:17,371
我很抱歉 部长先生
I'm so sorry, uh, Mr. Secretary.

779
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:21,075
该死的Gibss哪儿去了
Where the hell is Gibbs?

780
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,783
联邦探员
Federal agents.

781
00:33:28,852 --> 00:33:30,852
嘿 举起手来
Hey, put your hands in the air.

782
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,220
离那个集装箱远一点
Back away from the container.

783
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,879
啊 没啥问题
Oh, looks good.

784
00:34:00,683 --> 00:34:03,050
警报解除 没有泄露
All clear, six-eight.

785
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,828
哇哦 这些很老旧了吧
Wow. These are old, huh?

786
00:34:13,897 --> 00:34:17,365
他们为什么不销毁呢
Why weren't they destroyed?

787
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:20,668
回收那些毒气并不能开脱NCIS的责任
Recovering that gas does not absolve NCIS.

788
00:34:20,737 --> 00:34:22,937
除了不遵从命令 非法黑客行为
In addition to disobeying orders, illegal hacking

789
00:34:23,006 --> 00:34:25,306
以及威胁政府要员 你还可以加上..
and-and threatening a government official, you can add...

790
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:27,575
见鬼了 我甚至还不知道该怎么称呼这个局面
well, hell, I don't even know what to call this charade.

791
00:34:27,644 --> 00:34:29,443
这不是胁迫 也不是诱捕
It's not coercion and it's not entrapment.

792
00:34:29,512 --> 00:34:31,913
-没什么用 McGee探员 -我全怪你 Leon
- Not helping, Agent McGee. - And I blame you, Leon.

793
00:34:31,981 --> 00:34:34,615
你就是这样运作你部门的吗 还有那个该死的Gibbs哪儿去了
Is this how you run your house? And where the hell is Gibbs?

794
00:34:34,684 --> 00:34:36,918
在这儿
Right here.

795
00:34:36,986 --> 00:34:38,946
Gibbs 你的警徽也可以丢进这堆了
Gibbs, you can add your badge to the growing pile.

796
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,260
这也给你了
You should have this, too.

797
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:47,862
那是什么
And what's that?

798
00:34:47,931 --> 00:34:51,666
Trine化工说他们按照军事合同的要求
Trine Chemical said they destroyed all their chlorine,

799
00:34:51,734 --> 00:34:52,834
销毁了全部氯气
per military contracts.

800
00:34:52,902 --> 00:34:54,502
但那都是鬼扯
Well, that's total BS.

801
00:34:54,571 --> 00:34:57,138
是啊 为了省钱他们撒谎了 实际上省了几百万
Yeah, they lied to save a buck. Millions, actually.

802
00:34:57,207 --> 00:34:58,539
我们调查了他们的记录
We went through their records.

803
00:34:58,608 --> 00:34:59,674
你们是非法调查
Illegally obtained.

804
00:34:59,742 --> 00:35:01,042
不 我们有搜查令
No, pretty sure we had a warrant.

805
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,476
当这一切结束时
When this is all over,

806
00:35:02,545 --> 00:35:04,645
-他们公司的股票就会崩溃 -就让他们崩溃啊
- company stock will crash. - Let it.

807
00:35:04,714 --> 00:35:07,481
他们欺骗了美国政府 你想说什么
They defrauded the United States government. Your point?

808
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,617
我想说 长官 你是他们的重要股东
My point, sir, is that you are a major shareholder,

809
00:35:09,686 --> 00:35:11,096
而且你将会损失大量财富
and you stand to lose a lot of money.

810
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,987
你认为我介入是钱的原因
You think I stepped in because of money?

811
00:35:13,056 --> 00:35:15,022
或者是因为你与CEO的友谊
Or your friendship with the CEO.

812
00:35:15,091 --> 00:35:18,025
我从未想到...
I-It never occurred to me that...

813
00:35:18,094 --> 00:35:21,362
在州政府要求我介入时 我不知道Trine卷入其中
I had no idea Trine was involved when State asked me to step in.

814
00:35:21,431 --> 00:35:22,797
放松 我们知道
Relax. We know.

815
00:35:22,866 --> 00:35:24,999
我和George Green好几个月没聊过了
And I haven't talked to George Green in months.

816
00:35:25,068 --> 00:35:26,412
至少这几天确实没有 我们查过了
Certainly not in the last few days. We checked.

817
00:35:26,436 --> 00:35:29,570
天啊 这看起来真糟糕
Geez, this looks bad.

818
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:31,772
但这并不意味着存在犯罪行为
Doesn't always mean there was a crime.

819
00:35:31,841 --> 00:35:33,407
对吗 主任
Right, Director?

820
00:35:36,446 --> 00:35:39,480
我想NCIS不是唯一一个
I guess NCIS weren't the only ones

821
00:35:39,549 --> 00:35:40,882
抢跑的人

822
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,183
在简报

以及偶尔的社交聚会之外

824
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,219
我和你互不相识 Leon
you and I don't know each other, Leon.

825
00:35:45,288 --> 00:35:47,655
我做了最坏的打算
I assumed the worst.

826
00:35:47,724 --> 00:35:49,857
我们都会犯错
Well, we all make mistakes.

827
00:35:49,926 --> 00:35:52,037
是啊 就像Bibbs探员和他的团队刚才提醒我的
Yes, as Agent Gibbs and his team have just reminded me.

828
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:53,661
好吧 如果是这样的话 主任
Well, if that's it, Director,

829
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:56,097
我要去参加一个新闻发布会

我得走在前面

为我的失误负起责任 还要祝贺NCIS完成了他们的任务
Take responsibility for my part, and congratulate NCIS on theirs.

833

也许下一次
Maybe next time,

834
00:36:04,974 --> 00:36:08,542
我们都会更加谨慎 对吗
we could both be a little more careful. Yeah?

835
00:36:19,255 --> 00:36:21,289
不对
Nope.

836
00:36:21,357 --> 00:36:22,423
干得好
Well done.

837

我一秒都没有怀疑过Gibbs
I never doubted Gibbs one second.

846

我怀疑了 不过我在适应
