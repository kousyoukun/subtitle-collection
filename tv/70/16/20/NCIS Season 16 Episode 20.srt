00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:06,601
Brinkman, Gilvary,
you're on the clock.

You want to chitchat,
do it on your own time.

3
00:00:08,805 --> 00:00:11,740
- Yeah, you got it, boss.
- Yo, Stutkowski, slow down!

4
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:14,142
This isn't the Daytona 500.

5
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:16,511
Geez, every morning.

6
00:00:20,884 --> 00:00:22,017
The hell?

7
00:00:33,697 --> 00:00:35,463
Whoa, cut it.

8
00:00:35,532 --> 00:00:36,931
Cut it!

9
00:00:51,281 --> 00:00:52,380
Whoa!

10
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,651
Oh, my God!

where losers dress up
like elves or whatever?

24
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:53,753
Well, technically yes,
but it's more than that.

25
00:01:53,777 --> 00:01:56,177
Yeah, so much more,
you have no idea.

26
00:01:56,246 --> 00:01:58,179
And this year's Con
is gonna be epic.

27
00:01:58,248 --> 00:01:59,614
For the 50th anniversary,

28
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:00,693
they announced they're

Mm-hmm.

31
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:06,721
We made a few calls, and we
found out who it might be.

32
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,022
You ready for this?

33
00:02:08,091 --> 00:02:09,190
So ready.

34
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:12,193
- George freakin' Lucas.
- Ha!

35
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:14,996
Oh, yeah. Who?

36
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:17,432
What do you mean who?
Are you kidding?

37
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:18,700
Uh...

38
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:21,770
<i>Star Wars, American Graffiti,</i>

41
00:02:25,108 --> 00:02:26,274
Oh, God, it hurts.

42
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:28,209
Nick, how do you not know this?

43
00:02:28,278 --> 00:02:30,378
I don't know, I think
it's because I have a life.

44
00:02:30,447 --> 00:02:32,692
- Yeah, a sheltered one.
- We don't have time to deal with

45
00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:34,449
your cinematic
shortcomings right now.

46
00:02:34,518 --> 00:02:36,684
You got that right.
Grab your gear.

00:02:36,753 --> 00:02:38,253
Got a dead Marine in Arlington.

48

Ooh, but badges go on sale

49
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:45,126

doesn't care about Greg Lucas.

50
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:47,595
George!

51
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:52,066
You're the person
in charge here, Mr. Lewis?

52
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:53,768
Yeah, I'm the foreman.

53
00:02:53,837 --> 00:02:55,670
But my crew had nothing
to do with this.

54
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,198
We broke ground on this site
just yesterday.

55
00:02:57,222 --> 00:02:58,374
Building what?

56
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,875
The entire plot's being turned
into luxury condos.

57
00:03:00,944 --> 00:03:02,143
What was here before?

58
00:03:02,212 --> 00:03:04,846
Nothing. The land's been vacant
for almost 20 years.

59
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:06,481
What time did you
discover the remains?

60
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,782
7:45 a.m.

61
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:11,186
The body...
you know who it is?

62
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:13,087
Not yet.

63
00:03:13,156 --> 00:03:14,322
Identification?

64
00:03:14,391 --> 00:03:18,359
No military I.D., name tag,
dog tag or wallet.

65
00:03:18,428 --> 00:03:20,829
- Where is Palmer?
- Stuck in traffic.

66
00:03:20,897 --> 00:03:22,664
He should be here
any minute.

67
00:03:22,732 --> 00:03:24,744
But I doubt he'd be able
to give us a time of death.

68
00:03:24,768 --> 00:03:26,768
I mean, this Marine has
been dead for years.

69
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:27,936
At least 18.

70
00:03:28,004 --> 00:03:29,337
How do you know that?

71
00:03:29,406 --> 00:03:32,473
She doesn't have any
Global War on Terror ribbons.

72
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:34,142
Oh.

73
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:40,281
Well, should narrow it down
in the missing persons database.

74
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:44,018
Gibbs?

75
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:45,887
Widen the perimeter.

76
00:03:45,956 --> 00:03:48,823
I want all of this
bagged and processed.

77
00:03:48,892 --> 00:03:50,892
<i>You know, today's technology</i>

78
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:52,327
is advancing at
such a fast rate

79
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:55,129
that a few years
is equivalent to a lifetime.

80
00:03:55,198 --> 00:03:58,967
Case in point... cell phones.

81
00:03:59,035 --> 00:04:00,913
These are not just for
making phone calls anymore.

82
00:04:00,937 --> 00:04:02,303
Oh, no. No, no.

83
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:06,140
I can, uh-- I can video chat
with Breena and Victoria.

84
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:08,877
And I can stream a show,
download music,

85
00:04:08,945 --> 00:04:10,678
film a video, read a book.

86
00:04:10,747 --> 00:04:13,214
Ah, we've accomplished so much,
yet we still can't figure out

87
00:04:13,283 --> 00:04:15,817
how to make the DMV
a pleasant experience.

88
00:04:15,886 --> 00:04:17,085
Make an appointment online.

89
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:18,319
You can do that?

90
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:20,321
Wait, <i>you</i> know how
to do that?

91
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:23,725
All right, moving on.

92
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:25,894
Luckily for us,
our victim's remains

93
00:04:25,962 --> 00:04:28,243
were discovered before they were
damaged by the excavator.

94
00:04:28,298 --> 00:04:30,665
I just sent here uniform
up to Kasie for analysis.

95
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:32,033
Cause of death?
Well,

96
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:34,402
these several cracked ribs here
do indicate a struggle,

97
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:38,339
but the fatal blow came
in the back of the skull here.

98
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:39,719
But the really
interesting part comes

99
00:04:39,743 --> 00:04:41,276
when we look at
the victim's teeth.

100
00:04:41,344 --> 00:04:44,412
I ran the serial number
on a surgical implant

101
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:46,748
for her left canine incisor.

102
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:49,450
And, Gibbs, I got a hit.

103
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,252
Meet our victim,

104
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:53,755
Major Ellen Wallace.

105
00:04:58,828 --> 00:05:01,596
<i>Breaking news out of D.C.,</i>

106
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:03,364
Department of Defense officials

107
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:07,101
have confirmed that among
the casualties in the attack

108
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,970
was Marine Major Ellen Wallace.

109
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,272
We'll continue to bring you
more information

110
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:13,041
as it comes in.

111
00:05:20,884 --> 00:05:22,917
- That's impossible.
- That's exactly my point.

112
00:05:22,986 --> 00:05:24,919
Ellen Wallace was not
a missing person.

113
00:05:24,988 --> 00:05:28,890
In fact, DoD listed her
as killed in action in...

114
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,224
The Pentagon, on 9/11.

115
00:05:32,963 --> 00:05:37,265
Then how did her
perfectly intact remains

116
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:40,635
find their way to a shallow
grave some 12 miles away?

117
00:05:55,448 --> 00:05:57,582
How much?

118
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,585
That's highway robbery.

119
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:03,821
Fine. I hate to play
this card, but you owe me.

120
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,493
No, no, I'm not threatening you.

121
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:11,162
Oh, okay, well,
I guess we'll see.

122
00:06:11,231 --> 00:06:15,433
Mm-hmm.
Tell Mom I said hi.

123
00:06:16,903 --> 00:06:18,036
What got you in a twist?

124
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:19,437
Comic-Con badges sold out,

125
00:06:19,506 --> 00:06:21,706
and every ticket broker
or connection I have

126
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:23,574
is 1,500 a pop.

127
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:26,277
Dollars? For a convention?

128
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:27,745
Who'd pay that?

129
00:06:27,814 --> 00:06:30,248
I would, if I had
that kind of cash.

130
00:06:30,316 --> 00:06:32,050
Guess what.
You don't need it.

131
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:33,551
Why? What have you heard?

132
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,120
Delilah scored three VIP badges.

133
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:38,189
- No.
- I am totally serious.

134
00:06:38,258 --> 00:06:40,024
Aah!

135
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:43,428
Yeah.

136
00:06:43,496 --> 00:06:44,695
Wow.

137
00:06:44,764 --> 00:06:46,021
You know, just being
near you two,

138
00:06:46,022 --> 00:06:48,055
I can feel my
cool factor dropping.

139
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:49,056
Give me an update.

140
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,358
- Let's go.
- All right.

141
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:53,694
Our victim is Ellen Wallace,

142
00:06:53,763 --> 00:06:55,140
38 years old,
a major in the Marine Corps

143
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,432
Public Affairs division,
stationed out of the Pentagon.

144
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,445
Wallace was listed as KIA
when her office was struck

145
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:02,403
by Flight 77 on 9/11.

146
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:04,305
Some victims' remains
were never recovered

147
00:07:04,373 --> 00:07:05,517
in the attacks,
and she was thought

148
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,774
to have been one of them.

149
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:08,208
Her death gathered
media attention

150
00:07:08,277 --> 00:07:10,611
because she's the daughter
of General James Wallace.

151
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,146
Guy's a military legend.

152
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:15,583
He led missions in Vietnam,
Lebanon, Liberia and Iraq.

153
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:18,252
Not to mention serving
as an advisor to the White House

154
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:19,920
after his retirement in 2007.

155
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:21,288
Yeah, I got it.

156
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,489
Get back to her.

157
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:24,758
Well, we now know
that her remains

158
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:25,827
were not in the Pentagon.

159
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,807
She wasn't in the building.

160
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:30,631
Well, where was she killed?

161
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,966
We don't know that yet.

162
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,342
Why was she killed?

163
00:07:33,343 --> 00:07:35,936
Well, we don't know that yet, either.

164
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:38,639
Suspects?

165
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,908
Well, we don't have those.

166
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:43,277
Find out!

167
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:45,980
Track her final movements.

168
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:47,514
Who saw her last?

169
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:51,785
Do your damn jobs!

170
00:07:54,757 --> 00:07:56,757
Wh-What was that about?

171
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,260
<i>Of course I remember that day.</i>

172
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:03,998
When you cheat death, the
details tend to stick with you.

173
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,000
You worked with
Major Ellen Wallace

174
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,268
back in 2001,
Miss Tano?

175
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:11,372
Yeah. A lifetime ago.

176
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,175
I was just a green
junior officer back then,

177
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,711
and Ellen was my
department head.

178
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,613
She took me under her wing,

179
00:08:19,682 --> 00:08:22,016
encouraged me.

180
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:25,552
I regret never having
thanked her for that.

181
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:28,622
When was the last time
you saw her?

182
00:08:28,691 --> 00:08:33,160
Oh, the night of
September 10, 2001.

183
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:35,029
We both attended
a command-wide

184
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,564
"Hail and Farewell" dinner
at a restaurant in Georgetown.

185
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:39,393
Did anything seem out
of the ordinary to you?

186
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,734
No, not really.

187
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:42,970
I mean, I could tell
Ellen was distracted.

188
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,083
I assumed it was work-related
since she left the party early

189
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,674
to go back to the Pentagon.

190
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:48,342
- What time was that?
- 8:30.

191
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:53,047
Like I said,
the details stuck with me.

192
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:57,317
Did she ever mention ever
having issues with anyone?

193
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:59,420
No, not directly.
Well, I did hear

194
00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:02,156
that she had a complicated
relationship with her ex-fiancé.

195
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:05,659
So you never saw her in the
office the morning of 9/11?

196
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:08,762
No. We were both scheduled to
attend a briefing at 1000 hours,

197
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:11,999
but I got rear-ended on my
way in and I was running late.

198
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:19,573
That inconvenience
ended up saving my life.

199
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,109
When the plane
struck the Pentagon,

200
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:26,547
our offices were directly hit...

201
00:09:26,615 --> 00:09:30,217
and no one else
in my division survived.

202
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:32,786
Why would
the DoD think that

203
00:09:32,855 --> 00:09:35,122
she was in the building
at the time of the attack?

204
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:39,793
Because Ellen was at work
at 0730 every morning,

205
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:43,731
and her car was found
on the premises.

206
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,933
Where else could she have been?

207
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,707
Last I heard, General
Wallace was retired.

208
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:55,709
I suppose, technically speaking,

209
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:58,545
but a Marine
never really retires.

210
00:09:58,614 --> 00:10:00,714
How long's he been a guest
lecturer at the Academy?

211
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:02,883
I brought him on
about three years ago.

212
00:10:02,952 --> 00:10:04,718
He's a favorite
among midshipmen.

213
00:10:04,787 --> 00:10:06,832
There's a tremendous amount
that they can learn from someone

214
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,422
as experienced as the general.

215
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:10,090
Sounds like you
know him well.

216
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,325
Had the pleasure
of serving

217
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:13,293
under his command
many years ago.

218
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,496
Owe my career to the man.
He's like family,

219
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:17,998
which is why
I am concerned.

220
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:20,067
I witnessed the toll
the death of his daughter

221
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:22,069
took on him back in 2001.

222
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:24,505
He shouldn't have to suffer
through that pain again.

223
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:26,740
No one should, General.

224
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:31,145
The military has rules
and the military gives orders,

225
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,147
but what happens
when those two

226
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,249
are in direct conflict
with one another?

227
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:37,985
Combat scenario number 67:

228
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:40,521
you're deployed to a combat zone
when your convoy

229
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:43,991
comes upon a group of possible
Taliban insurgents.

230
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:46,460
They haven't engaged you,
but your gut

231
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:50,664
is telling you that things
are going to go south, and fast.

232
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,499
Do you let rules dictated
in some handbook

233
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:56,603
override your instincts,
or do you take action?

234
00:10:57,873 --> 00:11:01,008
Ticktock, ladies and gentlemen.

235
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:03,310
Your enemies could be seconds
away from killing you.

236
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,779
Do you strike first?

237
00:11:05,848 --> 00:11:07,714
Negative.

238
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,218
Only after the enemy

239
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:13,453
has engaged does
a U.S. service member

240
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:15,889
take offensive measures.

241
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,925
Regulations also say
you have the right to take

242
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,227
appropriate actions
to defend yourself.

243
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:23,030
Hesitation could
cost you your life.

244
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:27,301
Yeah, but suspicion
isn't fact, it's fear.

245
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:29,403
Break the rules
of engagement,

246
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:32,172
you've already lost.

247
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:35,142
Right answer.

248
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:37,978
I should see you all
writing that down.

249
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:43,917
Should've known
NCIS wouldn't show up here

250
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:45,552
to deliver good news.

251
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,821
Occupational hazard, General.

252
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,366
While I appreciate you
telling me in person, Gibbs,

253
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:53,268
I can't say that makes it
any easier to hear.

254
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,438
Give it
to me straight.

255
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,207
What happened to my daughter?

256
00:12:04,114 --> 00:12:06,548
The investigation's ongoing.

257
00:12:06,617 --> 00:12:07,983
We're looking into it.

258
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:09,484
You're looking into it?

259
00:12:09,553 --> 00:12:11,219
Someone murdered

260
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:12,928
my little girl
and has gotten away with it

261
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:14,723
for the past 18 years.

262
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,159
- I want him found.
- General.

263
00:12:17,227 --> 00:12:19,661
I'm on it.

264
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:25,400
Of all my regrets in life,
not having more time for Ellen

265
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:27,002
is at the top of the list.

266
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,504
You know what my last words
to her were?

267
00:12:30,807 --> 00:12:33,642
"We'll talk later,
I'm running late."

268
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:36,711
When was that?

269
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,080
The night of September 10th
in the Pentagon.

270
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:42,584
I passed by her office
on my way out around 2300 hours.

271
00:12:42,653 --> 00:12:45,020
Not being late to drinks
with a colleague

272
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:49,824
was more important than talking
to my own daughter.

273
00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:52,060
- Regret is a...
- Yeah.

274
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:53,361
It's a son of a bitch.

275
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,938
You see this through
to the end, Gibbs.

276
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:06,508
No matter what.

277
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:10,512
Understood.

278
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,582
These are the most disorganized
bins I have ever seen.

279
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,585
I could go full
Marie Kondo on these.

280
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:18,220
Okay, you're a little
too excited

281
00:13:18,288 --> 00:13:20,589
about some dusty containers.

282
00:13:20,657 --> 00:13:23,191
Oh! Floppy disks.

283
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,393
Cool!

284
00:13:25,462 --> 00:13:26,962
Ooh, look who's a little

285
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,730
"too excited" now.
- Oh, come on.

286
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,132
These things are relics. Ugh.

287
00:13:33,804 --> 00:13:35,537
I feel just like Dr. Grant

288
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,473
when he first sees the
Brachiosaurus in <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

289
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:39,908
You mean Brontosaurus?

290
00:13:39,977 --> 00:13:42,143
Uh, no. You don't want
to go toe-to-toe with me

291
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:44,879
on some <i>JP</i> trivia.

292
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,216
This is sad, isn't it?

293
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,285
I mean, the contents
of these bins

294
00:13:50,354 --> 00:13:54,723
are all that's left of Ellen
Wallace, and they were just

295
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,959
sitting in a storage unit.
- Ah, well,

296
00:13:58,028 --> 00:13:59,761
they say you can
learn a lot about someone

297
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,396
based on what they leave behind.

298
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,431
Wonder what we'll learn
from her things.

299
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,401
Uh, well,

300
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,205
how about the identity
of her ex-fiancé?

301
00:14:10,274 --> 00:14:13,108
- Oh, yeah, that's a start.
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:16,244
Wait, is that Gibbs?

303
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,079
And a hot Gibbs?

304
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,915
Yeah, Gibbs didn't just know
Ellen Wallace,

305
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:22,751
he was engaged to her.

306
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:37,206
Do you agree
with the Pentagon's decision

307
00:14:37,207 --> 00:14:40,175
to prevent women from serving
on the front lines?

308
00:14:40,244 --> 00:14:43,011
As a Marine, it is my duty
to serve my country

309
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,580
and to follow the orders
of my chain of command.

310
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:47,482
That being said,
it's been my experience

311
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,085
that there is no gender
distinction when it comes

312
00:14:50,153 --> 00:14:53,855
to the capabilities and courage
of our military service members.

313
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:55,323
I believe that any Marine
who meets

314
00:14:55,392 --> 00:14:57,232
the physical and mental
qualifications deserves

315
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:58,827
the same consideration.

316
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:01,696
Equal rights
are not special rights.

317
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,534
She was engaged to Gibbs?

318
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:08,537
How could Gibbs not tell us that
he was engaged to the victim?

319
00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:11,084
Are you kidding? Gibbs never
talks about his personal life.

320
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:11,690
Hmm.

321
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:13,714
We only find out about it
when it's part of a case.

322
00:15:13,877 --> 00:15:15,021
Hold up.
This has happened before?

323
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:16,478
Exhibit A.

324
00:15:16,547 --> 00:15:19,481
Ah, the Gibbs' wives club.

325
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,882
Uh...

326
00:15:20,951 --> 00:15:22,517
I'm sorry, Gibbs
was married

327
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:25,320
four times? What, does he have
a marriage punch card

328
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:26,368
and the fifth one is free?

329
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:27,223
He had to know

330
00:15:27,224 --> 00:15:28,723
that we would figure it out.

331
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:30,892
Do we tell him we know,
or do we wait for him to say

332
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:32,643
that he knows that we know?

333
00:15:32,644 --> 00:15:34,589
Since we don't know if it's
relevant to the case yet,

334
00:15:34,613 --> 00:15:36,579
we leave it alone, for now.

335
00:15:36,648 --> 00:15:38,114
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

336
00:15:38,183 --> 00:15:39,382
Ooh. Incoming.

337
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:42,119
Hey, Gibbs.

338
00:15:42,154 --> 00:15:43,753
What do we know?
On the night

339
00:15:43,822 --> 00:15:46,322
of September 10, 2001,
Ellen was seen

340
00:15:46,391 --> 00:15:48,958
at a command-wide Hail
and Farewell in Georgetown

341
00:15:49,027 --> 00:15:51,461
by her former
coworker Amy Tano.

342
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,464
Now, Tano said Ellen left around
2030 hours for the Pentagon.

343
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:56,310
This was confirmed
by General Wallace.

344
00:15:56,334 --> 00:16:00,470
He said he saw Ellen in her
office at 2300 hours that night.

345
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:02,672
So far, he's the last person
to have seen Ellen alive.

346
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:04,574
Bishop,
Torres, verify

347
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:07,977
Pentagon access codes,
9/10, 9/11.

348
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:10,847
Pinpoint when she
left the building.

349
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,081
On it.

350
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,651
McGee, look into
her phone records.

351
00:16:13,652 --> 00:16:15,952
Find out who
she was communicating with.

352
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:19,689
Boss, is that all?

353
00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:21,257
Is there...

354
00:16:21,326 --> 00:16:23,026
nothing more
you want to tell me?

355
00:16:23,094 --> 00:16:24,594
No.

356
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:27,964
Okay.

357
00:16:37,008 --> 00:16:40,043
Hey, did we say something funny?
Oh, no, I just, um,

358
00:16:40,111 --> 00:16:43,346
I thought that you asked me
to piece together

359
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:45,782
the corrupted data
of a security system

360
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:49,385
that was definitely destroyed
18 years ago.

361
00:16:49,454 --> 00:16:51,287
Yeah. That is what we're asking.

362
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,324
I'm sorry, um...

363
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:57,460
Do you have any idea how complex
that request is?

364
00:16:57,529 --> 00:16:58,861
Like, let alone

365
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,374
the specialized manpower
that would be needed

366
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:03,132
to get it to you by... by when?

367
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:04,667
24 hours.

368
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:08,538
48 hours.

369
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,174
No. At first, I thought
this was funny,

370
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:14,043
but this is just annoying.

371
00:17:14,112 --> 00:17:15,645
How about
an incentive,

372
00:17:15,714 --> 00:17:17,247
to expedite things?

373
00:17:17,315 --> 00:17:19,349
Like what, Freckles?

374
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:21,384
Three VIP badges
to Comic-Con.

375
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:22,652
- What?
- What?

376
00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:25,321
What? W-What? Um...

377
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,090
If you're scamming
me right now,

378
00:17:27,158 --> 00:17:29,826
I will put you
on a watch list so fast.

379
00:17:29,894 --> 00:17:31,361
100% legit.
What do you say?

380
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:33,162
No, no, no. Hold on.
That-- we're not...

381
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:35,276
Deal. Done. Yes. Ooh!
Call you when I have something.

382
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:41,104
You are in for a world of hurt.

383
00:17:41,172 --> 00:17:42,538
<i>Not finding anything</i>

384
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:44,741
in Ellen Wallace's
home phone records.

385
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:48,678
Just a bunch of AOL
dial-up connections. Ooh.

386
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:50,780
Now, that is something
I haven't said in years.

387
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:52,382
Any luck with her office line?

388
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,951
Nope. Nothing yet.
How about cell phone records?

389
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,830
Didn't have one.

390
00:17:55,854 --> 00:17:57,655
Ah. A disinterest
in mobile technology.

391
00:17:57,656 --> 00:18:00,423
Well, that's at least something
she had in common with Gibbs.

392
00:18:00,492 --> 00:18:03,359
Well, they weren't commonplace
in 2001 like they are today.

393
00:18:03,428 --> 00:18:06,562
Ugh. Tell me about it.
You know, I had a six-year-old

394
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:09,766
run right into me
while he was texting last week?

395
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:12,368
So I told him to put
the phone down and go play.

396
00:18:12,437 --> 00:18:15,705
Man, you know, he stepped on
my foot and told me to shut up.

397
00:18:15,774 --> 00:18:18,875
Just, the whole "joy
of children" concept, just...

398
00:18:18,943 --> 00:18:20,910
lost on me.

399
00:18:22,614 --> 00:18:24,380
Earth to McGee.

400
00:18:24,449 --> 00:18:25,748
What?

401
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:27,216
Did you find something?

402
00:18:27,285 --> 00:18:29,719
Um, I'm not sure.

403
00:18:29,788 --> 00:18:31,721
Ooh. Hold that thought.

404
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:35,792
That is the blood analysis
from Ellen Wallace's uniform.

405
00:18:38,863 --> 00:18:41,431
Uh, McGee?

406
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:42,999
We got a problem.

407
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:45,335
There were two separate
blood profiles

408
00:18:45,403 --> 00:18:47,337
found on her clothing.

409
00:18:47,405 --> 00:18:49,339
Jimmy said there were
signs of a struggle.

410
00:18:49,407 --> 00:18:51,341
The second profile
could be the killer's.

411
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:53,176
Yeah, I really hope not,

412
00:18:53,244 --> 00:18:55,611
because it's a match to Gibbs.

413
00:18:57,215 --> 00:19:00,817
How'd his blood get
on her uniform?

414
00:19:00,885 --> 00:19:03,619
You do realize what this means.

415
00:19:33,385 --> 00:19:34,562
Yeah, I'd get the knife
from Gibbs

416
00:19:34,586 --> 00:19:37,387
before interrogating him,
if I were you.

417
00:19:37,455 --> 00:19:38,688
Why are you looking at me?

418
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:40,289
I'm not going in there.

419
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:41,724
Good luck, Bishop.

420
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:43,893
Oh, no, nice try.

421
00:19:43,962 --> 00:19:47,797
No, I've cheated death
a few too many times recently.

422
00:19:47,866 --> 00:19:49,532
Show us how it's done, McGee.

423
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:51,167
No. Pass.

424
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:53,069
You're senior field agent.

425
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:54,858
Which is exactly
why I should be supervising

426
00:19:54,906 --> 00:19:56,305
and observing
Gibbs' questioning.

427
00:19:56,374 --> 00:19:58,708
Oh, for the love of God.

428
00:20:05,717 --> 00:20:07,583
Okay.

429
00:20:07,652 --> 00:20:10,219
You know how this goes, Gibbs,
so let's skip

430
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:13,556
the interrogation dance and get
this over with, shall we?

431
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,724
Gladly.

432
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:18,861
Tell me about your relationship
with Ellen Wallace.

433
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:23,433
She was an ex.

434
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:25,501
You mean, uh, ex-fiancée.

435
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,086
Ex is an ex.

436
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,739
How'd you meet?

437
00:20:30,341 --> 00:20:31,493
Complicated.

438
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:32,743
Why did you break it off?

439
00:20:32,744 --> 00:20:34,744
More complicated.

440
00:20:34,846 --> 00:20:36,612
Did it end on good terms?

441
00:20:37,749 --> 00:20:39,515
Does it ever?

442
00:20:39,584 --> 00:20:40,850
Good point.

443
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:42,385
It's like watching
John McEnroe

444
00:20:42,454 --> 00:20:44,387
and Jimmy Connors
at Wimbledon.

445
00:20:44,456 --> 00:20:46,923
That is the whitest thing
I've ever heard.

446
00:20:46,991 --> 00:20:48,891
Why hide that you knew
the victim?

447
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,360
It wasn't relevant.

448
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:55,231
Your blood at the crime scene
makes it relevant.

449
00:20:57,135 --> 00:20:59,268
Look, Gibbs, come on,
work with me here.

450
00:20:59,337 --> 00:21:02,405
'Cause I sure as hell know
you didn't kill Major Wallace.

451
00:21:02,474 --> 00:21:03,639
Then why am I sitting here?

452
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,943
Because we need answers
that only you can give.

453
00:21:07,011 --> 00:21:10,079
Like how did your blood
get on Ellen's uniform?

454
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:21,791
Oh.

455
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,159
Let me see.

456
00:21:26,664 --> 00:21:28,097
Oh, that's gonna stain.

457
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,266
It's a good thing I was here,

458
00:21:30,335 --> 00:21:32,168
otherwise this hand
might be a goner.

459
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:40,977
There.

460
00:21:42,814 --> 00:21:44,847
That should do it.

461
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,649
You'll get my bill in the mail.

462
00:21:48,753 --> 00:21:51,420
<i>Were you with Ellen</i>
<i>when she died?</i>

463
00:21:51,489 --> 00:21:53,589
No.

464
00:21:53,658 --> 00:21:56,259
When was the last time
you two had contact?

465
00:21:57,362 --> 00:21:59,428
Two months prior to 9/11.

466
00:22:01,165 --> 00:22:03,432
Satisfied?

467
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:07,436
You didn't catch it, did you?

468
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:12,141
I asked why you broke it off
and you didn't correct me.

469
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,609
It's interesting.

470
00:22:13,678 --> 00:22:15,211
All of your previous

471
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,681
failed relationships
have one thing in common.

472
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,384
Your exes all ended things.

473
00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:25,021
But that wasn't the
case with Ellen.

474
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:26,989
She was different, wasn't she?

475
00:22:29,594 --> 00:22:31,127
Tell me why.

476
00:22:37,368 --> 00:22:40,036
Uh, Gibbs?

477
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,476
- Move, McGee.
- Can't do that, boss.

478
00:22:47,545 --> 00:22:49,178
Your interrogation's not over.

479
00:22:49,247 --> 00:22:51,247
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

480
00:22:51,316 --> 00:22:54,183
It's over when you
quit lying to us.

481
00:22:54,252 --> 00:22:56,552
You said you hadn't had contact
with Ellen in two months.

482
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:58,187
I've got phone records

483
00:22:58,256 --> 00:23:00,156
that show that she made
a two-minute call

484
00:23:00,224 --> 00:23:02,224
to your house the last night
she was seen alive.

485
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:04,060
So what'd you two talk about?

486
00:23:06,598 --> 00:23:08,331
I said we didn't.

487
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:09,810
You know that's not
good enough, boss.

488
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:11,334
Hell it ain't.

489
00:23:11,402 --> 00:23:13,269
You're off the case.

490
00:23:19,344 --> 00:23:20,710
What did you say?

491
00:23:20,778 --> 00:23:22,912
I said you're off the case.

492
00:23:22,981 --> 00:23:24,547
Go home, Gibbs.

493
00:23:53,387 --> 00:23:55,921
Is staring
at this helping?

494
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,956
Just running through
things in my head.

495
00:23:57,992 --> 00:24:00,893
How about
verbalizing them?

496
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:02,461
- With you?
- Mm-hmm.

497
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,596
Sure, I can do that.
You know why?

498
00:24:04,665 --> 00:24:06,932
Because I respect the people
that I work with.

499
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:08,600
Unlike some people.

500
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:11,270
Ah, "some people"
being Gibbs.

501
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:14,640
16 years. Gibbs has known me
for 16 years

502
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:17,409
and he still doesn't trust me.
- I don't know about that.

503
00:24:17,478 --> 00:24:19,122
I mean, I understand
that Gibbs likes being

504
00:24:19,146 --> 00:24:21,480
a closed book,
I get that, okay?

505
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:24,483
But I'm trying to help him and
he refuses to be honest with me.

506
00:24:24,552 --> 00:24:26,352
Did I mention the 16 years part?

507
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,921
- You did.
- Good, 'cause it bears repeating.

508
00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:30,956
- Mm.
- More like 16 and a half.

509
00:24:31,025 --> 00:24:33,592
Hey, Tim, you have every right

510
00:24:33,661 --> 00:24:36,628
to feel frustrated,
but you got one thing wrong.

511
00:24:36,697 --> 00:24:38,464
Gibbs does trust you.

512
00:24:38,532 --> 00:24:40,310
More than anyone, think about it.

513
00:24:40,334 --> 00:24:42,768
This case is personal for him.

514
00:24:42,837 --> 00:24:45,671
Would he have left if
he didn't trust you?

515
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,774
Listen, we all deal
with things differently.

516
00:24:48,843 --> 00:24:50,809
Gibbs' way isn't perfect,

517
00:24:50,878 --> 00:24:52,644
but it gets him through
and he...

518
00:24:52,713 --> 00:24:54,213
I know, I know.
He's got to get there

519
00:24:54,281 --> 00:24:55,881
on his own.
- Precisely.

520
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,349
But that doesn't mean

521
00:24:57,418 --> 00:25:00,285
you can't lead him
in the right direction.

522
00:25:02,757 --> 00:25:04,201
Wait, it's
been less than 24 hours.

523
00:25:04,225 --> 00:25:05,535
How do you have
something already?

524
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:07,359
Looks like my
incentive worked.

525
00:25:07,428 --> 00:25:09,328
Three tickets to loser-con,
as promised.

526
00:25:09,397 --> 00:25:11,029
Ooh-ho-ho-ho.

527
00:25:11,098 --> 00:25:12,398
Yeah, this helped,

528
00:25:12,466 --> 00:25:15,334
but I am also
just good at my job.

529
00:25:15,403 --> 00:25:18,070
That's, like, why they pay me
the big GS-14 bucks, so...

530
00:25:18,139 --> 00:25:20,005
14? What do you mean, 14?

531
00:25:20,074 --> 00:25:22,641
How do you have
a higher pay grade than me?

532
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,254
You're not even
old enough to rent a car.

533
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:26,012
Uh, no, but I could
just buy one, so...

534
00:25:26,036 --> 00:25:27,046
Okay.

535
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:28,981
- Can we get back on track here?
- Mm-hmm.

536
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:30,983
- What'd you find?
- Yeah, so...

537
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:33,852
because most of the Pentagon's
systems were damaged

538
00:25:33,921 --> 00:25:35,921
during the terror attack,
I was able to access

539
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,557
an encrypted file;
it was on an old backup server

540
00:25:38,626 --> 00:25:40,993
and it was last
updated at 0800

541
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:42,561
the morning of 9/11.

542
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,929
So does it list
Ellen Wallace

543
00:25:43,998 --> 00:25:45,542
entering and exiting the building?
- Yeah.

544
00:25:45,566 --> 00:25:47,533
Uh, we have her...

545
00:25:47,601 --> 00:25:50,569
scanning in at 2200 hours
the night of September 10th,

546
00:25:50,638 --> 00:25:53,672
and there is no record
of her ever leaving.

547
00:25:53,741 --> 00:25:55,507
Maybe she, uh, left
and forgot to scan out.

548
00:25:55,576 --> 00:25:57,287
That's not possible.
The Pentagon's points of entry

549
00:25:57,311 --> 00:25:59,178
are all one-for-ones,
so can't get in or out

550
00:25:59,246 --> 00:26:00,546
without scanning your I.D.

551
00:26:00,614 --> 00:26:01,992
So, according to our
logs, Ellen Wallace

552
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:04,349
should have still been
inside the building

553
00:26:04,418 --> 00:26:05,551
the morning of 9/11.

554
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:07,252
But she wasn't.

555
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:09,588
Mm-mm, because her body
was moved.

556
00:26:09,657 --> 00:26:11,223
Ellen was killed
inside the Pentagon

557
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:13,025
that night and then
taken off-site.

558
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:16,295
So, our killer...
has to be someone

559
00:26:16,363 --> 00:26:18,397
who worked
in the building with her.

560
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:20,299
How many?

561
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:22,901
That's 18,482.

562
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:27,806
Ooh. But it does eliminate
one suspect.

563
00:26:35,983 --> 00:26:37,783
Thought I locked the door.

564
00:26:37,852 --> 00:26:40,285
I know how to use
my knife, too.

565
00:26:44,358 --> 00:26:45,991
Since you've been
ignoring my calls,

566
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,893
thought I would come
down here and tell you

567
00:26:47,962 --> 00:26:50,929
that you've been
cleared as a suspect.

568
00:26:50,998 --> 00:26:52,931
Not that any of us
thought you were guilty.

569
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,566
Just enough to throw me
off the case.

570
00:26:54,635 --> 00:26:56,435
You got yourself
thrown off the case.

571
00:26:56,504 --> 00:26:58,570
I did exactly what you would do.

572
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:00,739
Unless, of course,
you burned more

573
00:27:00,808 --> 00:27:02,407
of those rules
that I should know about?

574
00:27:03,911 --> 00:27:05,344
You know, I don't get it.

575
00:27:05,412 --> 00:27:06,845
After all these years,

576
00:27:06,914 --> 00:27:08,394
after everything
we've been through...

577
00:27:09,683 --> 00:27:11,250
...I'm still here with you.

578
00:27:11,318 --> 00:27:13,252
- Ah, it's your choice.
- No, that's not gonna

579
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,419
work on me, Gibbs.

580
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:15,687
You think
that we don't know

581
00:27:15,756 --> 00:27:17,155
why you keep us
at a distance?

582
00:27:17,224 --> 00:27:18,790
It's not a mystery.

583
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:19,811
Get to the point, McGee.

584
00:27:19,835 --> 00:27:20,927
Ellen was
important to you,

585
00:27:20,928 --> 00:27:22,361
but we can't solve this case

586
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:23,874
unless you tell us everything
that happened.

587
00:27:23,898 --> 00:27:25,330
- I already did.
- No, you didn't.

588
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:26,977
You didn't tell us about
the conversation

589
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:28,800
you had with her
the night she was killed.

590
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:31,203
Now, whatever Ellen said during
that call could point us

591
00:27:31,272 --> 00:27:32,804
to who was after her.

592
00:27:32,873 --> 00:27:34,584
And I'm not leaving
till I get an answer, Gibbs.

593
00:27:34,608 --> 00:27:35,874
What did you two talk about?

594
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,846
We didn't talk!

595
00:27:56,564 --> 00:27:59,197
Jethro, it's me.

596
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:01,833
I know we haven't spoken
since...

597
00:28:01,902 --> 00:28:04,136
well, it's been a while.

598
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:07,139
I've thought a lot about you.

599
00:28:07,207 --> 00:28:08,740
Wondered how you were doing.

600
00:28:11,211 --> 00:28:12,978
Something's come up.

601
00:28:13,047 --> 00:28:14,980
It's important.

602
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:17,749
We need to talk.
If you're there, pick up.

603
00:28:19,453 --> 00:28:21,086
Please.

604
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:26,858
<i>I didn't answer the phone.</i>

605
00:28:26,927 --> 00:28:30,896
And I didn't
call her back either.

606
00:28:30,965 --> 00:28:32,698
Why not?

607
00:28:32,766 --> 00:28:35,233
I thought that she wanted
to talk about us.

608
00:28:39,473 --> 00:28:42,374
She was asking...
for me to help.

609
00:28:43,477 --> 00:28:45,544
Asking for my help.

610
00:28:49,683 --> 00:28:52,017
I didn't pick up the damn phone.

611
00:28:53,687 --> 00:28:55,621
Boss, you didn't kill Ellen.

612
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:58,757
I didn't save her, either.

613
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:06,565
Maybe I could have.

614
00:29:10,137 --> 00:29:13,238
Then don't make
the same mistake twice.

615
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:19,478
Ellen still needs
your help, boss.

616
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,082
So do we.

617
00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:43,669
Oh, please don't crash.

618
00:29:43,737 --> 00:29:45,570
Oh, please don't crash,
please don't crash.

619
00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:47,639
Hold the phone.

620
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:50,509
Is that an
IBM ThinkPad 240X?

621
00:29:50,577 --> 00:29:52,256
You've seen
one of these things before?

622
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,413
I had one of these.

623
00:29:53,414 --> 00:29:54,780
Like 20 years ago.

624
00:29:54,848 --> 00:29:57,416
Oh, this baby came fully loaded
with 64 megs of RAM,

625
00:29:57,484 --> 00:30:00,252
an Intel Celeron 300
Pentium III processor

626
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,254
that clocked in
at 500 megahertz...

627
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:03,822
And look.

628
00:30:03,891 --> 00:30:05,257
I mean, come on.

629
00:30:05,325 --> 00:30:07,592
That is the flying
toaster screensaver.

630
00:30:09,196 --> 00:30:11,273
You don't seem nearly
as excited about this.

631
00:30:11,297 --> 00:30:12,865
I was. Two hours

632
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:14,700
and multiple system crashes ago.

633
00:30:14,768 --> 00:30:17,169
Oh, did the victim's laptop
give us anything?

634
00:30:17,237 --> 00:30:19,604
Oh, I found
a private e-mail address

635
00:30:19,673 --> 00:30:21,673
Ellen had been using
on the side.

636
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:22,370
To do what?

637
00:30:22,394 --> 00:30:24,594
Well, the only thing she was
using this account for

638
00:30:24,712 --> 00:30:27,546
was to communicate meet-up times
and locations with another user

639
00:30:27,614 --> 00:30:30,782
named EyesnEars257.

640
00:30:30,851 --> 00:30:32,884
"East Potomac Park at noon."

641
00:30:32,953 --> 00:30:35,954
Now, that e-mail was sent
September 10, 2001,

642
00:30:36,023 --> 00:30:38,296
the day our victim
was last seen alive.

643
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,225
Okay, so are you able

644
00:30:39,226 --> 00:30:41,493
to find out the identity
of her mystery contact?

645
00:30:41,562 --> 00:30:42,794
Not on this thing.

646
00:30:42,863 --> 00:30:44,730
No.

647
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:47,165
Time to watch the magic happen.

648
00:30:47,234 --> 00:30:50,302
Secret e-mail address,

649
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:53,171
clandestine rendezvous...

650
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,073
Ellen Wallace,
what were you mixed up in?

651
00:30:56,744 --> 00:30:58,243
Oh, and it crashed.

652
00:30:59,646 --> 00:31:01,413
Am I being recorded?

653
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,517
You have to tell me
if this is being recorded.

654
00:31:07,154 --> 00:31:08,487
It's the law.

655
00:31:09,723 --> 00:31:12,157
You seem a little
paranoid, Mr. Morrison.

656
00:31:12,226 --> 00:31:14,186
I'm a journalist who was
grabbed out of his office

657
00:31:14,228 --> 00:31:15,894
by two federal agents
and brought into

658
00:31:15,963 --> 00:31:17,329
an interrogation room.

659
00:31:17,397 --> 00:31:21,199
Paranoia is warranted
in this situation.

660
00:31:21,268 --> 00:31:24,336
All right, I didn't grab,
I guided.

661
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:26,605
And this is a conference room,
not interrogation.

662
00:31:26,673 --> 00:31:28,740
You tell us what we need to know

663
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:30,509
and you won't be seeing
the real thing.

664
00:31:30,577 --> 00:31:32,677
Does the username

665
00:31:32,746 --> 00:31:35,113
"EyesnEars257"
ring a bell?

666
00:31:35,182 --> 00:31:37,949
It was my old e-mail log-in.

667
00:31:38,018 --> 00:31:40,352
I used that account
as a tip line

668
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,355
back when I first got started
in investigative reporting.

669
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:47,292
Haven't accessed it in 15 years.

670
00:31:47,361 --> 00:31:49,094
What was your connection
to Ellen Wallace?

671
00:31:51,198 --> 00:31:54,099
Ellen?

672
00:31:54,168 --> 00:31:55,734
What's this all about?

673
00:31:55,803 --> 00:31:56,968
You first.

674
00:32:00,107 --> 00:32:03,408
Ellen and I worked together
on an investigation.

675
00:32:03,477 --> 00:32:04,810
Into what?

676
00:32:04,878 --> 00:32:08,880
A 1998 attack in Kosovo.

677
00:32:10,384 --> 00:32:13,485
Rebel soldiers were blamed
for the deaths

678
00:32:13,554 --> 00:32:15,487
of multiple civilians,

679
00:32:15,556 --> 00:32:19,791
but I found a Marine eyewitness

680
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,661
who said it was the fault
of U.S. forces.

681
00:32:24,665 --> 00:32:26,431
Ellen was helping me

682
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,100
track down my source
after he went MIA.

683
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:31,403
Investigating Marines
wasn't part of her job.

684
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:34,606
Her interest in the case
was personal.

685
00:32:34,675 --> 00:32:36,274
The Marine
who commanded

686
00:32:36,343 --> 00:32:39,811
the U.S. forces in Kosovo was

687
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,813
General James Wallace.

688
00:32:44,818 --> 00:32:47,819
Wait. She was digging up dirt
on her own father?

689
00:32:47,888 --> 00:32:51,189
Ellen was determined

690
00:32:51,258 --> 00:32:53,191
to know the truth.

691
00:32:55,696 --> 00:32:59,297
Even if that meant exposing
the general as a war criminal.

692
00:33:13,338 --> 00:33:15,772
You're not insinuating
that the general

693
00:33:15,874 --> 00:33:18,541
had something to do
with his own daughter's death?

694
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,376
I'm not here to enroll.

695
00:33:22,614 --> 00:33:24,558
I'm not gonna stand here
and let him disrespect...

696
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:26,616
Daniel, give us
the room.

697
00:33:26,684 --> 00:33:28,785
It's fine.
I'll handle this.

698
00:33:31,956 --> 00:33:33,790
Hmm.

699
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:37,894
You always were as subtle
as a freight train, Gibbs.

700
00:33:37,962 --> 00:33:40,797
Kosovo. 1998.

701
00:33:40,865 --> 00:33:43,199
Multiple civilian
casualties.

702
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:44,834
I'm familiar with the incident.

703
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:46,836
Were U.S. forces
responsible?

704
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:49,172
I never would've given
an order like that,

705
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,340
and if I had, I wouldn't
have lied about it.

706
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:52,689
That's not what I asked,
General.

707
00:33:52,744 --> 00:33:54,677
At first, I brushed off

708
00:33:54,746 --> 00:33:57,346
those rumors
as baseless chatter,

709
00:33:57,415 --> 00:34:00,817
but when that reporter told me
the Marine eyewitness account,

710
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:02,919
I began to suspect
there was more to it.

711
00:34:02,987 --> 00:34:06,856
You asked Ellen
to investigate what happened.

712
00:34:06,925 --> 00:34:09,158
She was the only one
I could trust.

713
00:34:09,227 --> 00:34:10,827
If my Marines
were involved,

714
00:34:10,895 --> 00:34:12,228
I wanted to know the truth,

715
00:34:12,297 --> 00:34:15,765
not some redacted statement
from the White House.

716
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:17,867
I never would've
gotten Ellen involved

717
00:34:17,936 --> 00:34:20,269
if I thought for a second
she'd be in any danger.

718
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:22,505
It's been 18 years
since I saw her face,

719
00:34:22,574 --> 00:34:25,575
18 years since
I heard her voice,

720
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:28,578
but the time doesn't matter.

721
00:34:28,646 --> 00:34:32,548
Losing a child, it's not a wound
that ever heals, is it?

722
00:34:34,652 --> 00:34:36,719
No.

723
00:34:36,788 --> 00:34:39,956
Even after you called off
the engagement,

724
00:34:40,024 --> 00:34:42,859
she never said
an ill word about you.

725
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:47,296
I've always liked you,
Gibbs, but, um,

726
00:34:47,365 --> 00:34:49,298
you didn't deserve my daughter.

727
00:34:51,703 --> 00:34:53,436
Agreed.

728
00:34:54,828 --> 00:34:56,272
Then give me an explanation

729
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:58,441
because it all
never made any sense.

730
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,077
I know you loved Ellen,

731
00:35:01,146 --> 00:35:03,980
so why did you cut and run
like you did?

732
00:35:05,116 --> 00:35:07,884
Because I loved her.

733
00:35:12,157 --> 00:35:15,057
And that never ends well.

734
00:35:24,903 --> 00:35:26,903
- Yo, this is gonna take forever.
- Hey, come on,

735
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:28,611
we're making progress.
- You know how long

736
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,241
it's gonna take to go through
18,000 Pentagon employees?

737
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,776
Nope, not all,

738
00:35:33,845 --> 00:35:37,246
just the 8,233 employees
that were in the building

739
00:35:37,315 --> 00:35:40,016
the evening of September 10th
up to the next morning.

740
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:42,852
So take that defeatist energy
somewhere else.

741
00:35:42,921 --> 00:35:44,687
Not defeatist, it's realistic.

742
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:46,989
Uh, well, maybe you'd have
a more optimistic disposition

743
00:35:47,058 --> 00:35:48,758
if you expanded
your wardrobe palette

744
00:35:48,826 --> 00:35:50,459
beyond the colors of black,

745
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:52,461
distressed black,
and gray-black.

746
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,930
Hey, you don't tweak a Picasso.

747
00:35:53,998 --> 00:35:56,599
I am sorry,

748
00:35:56,668 --> 00:35:58,968
did you just compare yourself
to a work of art?

749
00:35:59,037 --> 00:36:01,304
Yes. Yes, I did.

750
00:36:03,174 --> 00:36:05,541
Uh, hold on one second,
I know this name.

751
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:09,011
Can you look up the service
record for Daniel Kent,

752
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,614
8340.

753
00:36:11,683 --> 00:36:13,516
Brigadier
General Kent,

754
00:36:13,585 --> 00:36:15,851
the current commandant
at the Academy.

755
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,286
In 2001 he worked

756
00:36:17,355 --> 00:36:19,689
as a military aide
to General James Wallace.

757
00:36:19,757 --> 00:36:22,291
Prior to 2001?
Uh, in 1998, Kent served

758
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,527
in Kosovo,
in the unit

759
00:36:24,596 --> 00:36:26,062
Ellen Wallace was investigating.

760
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,496
Ooh, now we're talking.

761
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:31,000
Security says he scanned
into the Pentagon

762
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:33,903
at 2330 hours
on September 10th,

763
00:36:33,972 --> 00:36:37,340
then scanned out
at 0239 hours on 9/11.

764
00:36:37,408 --> 00:36:39,375
That's enough time
to kill Ellen,

765
00:36:39,444 --> 00:36:41,510
remove her body from
the building, and bury her.

766
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,347
Yeah, well, I'm about
to complete the clue trifecta.

767
00:36:44,415 --> 00:36:45,615
According to his
old pay stubs,

768
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,217
in 2001, Kent lived
in a building

769
00:36:48,286 --> 00:36:50,853
two blocks from where
Ellen's body was buried.

770
00:36:50,922 --> 00:36:53,256
How's my disposition
now, baby?

771
00:36:56,794 --> 00:36:59,829
I hope you are both
enjoying this

772
00:36:59,897 --> 00:37:01,537
because I'm gonna have
both of your badges

773
00:37:01,566 --> 00:37:02,865
by the end of the day.

774
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:05,534
Then I guess we better
hurry, right, McGee?

775
00:37:05,603 --> 00:37:07,570
Yeah, where should we start?

776
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:10,273
Well, he seems
like a smart guy,

777
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:13,576
so I say we, uh, we just
lay out what we think happened

778
00:37:13,645 --> 00:37:15,089
between him and Ellen Wallace
that night.

779
00:37:15,113 --> 00:37:16,473
Hypothetically speaking,
of course.

780
00:37:16,514 --> 00:37:17,914
Stop us if we go too fast for you.

781
00:37:17,938 --> 00:37:19,616
Kosovo, 1998,

782
00:37:19,617 --> 00:37:22,551
you and a few Marines mistakenly
kill civilians during a raid.

783
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,954
Which you then covered up
from your chain of command.

784
00:37:25,023 --> 00:37:27,690
You thought you were in the
clear, until you caught wind

785
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:29,358
that Ellen Wallace
was investigating it.

786
00:37:29,427 --> 00:37:31,861
You panic. You confront her
in her office,

787
00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:34,130
then you kill her and bury her
by your old apartment.

788
00:37:34,198 --> 00:37:36,232
All the evidence left
behind in the Pentagon

789
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:39,001
was destroyed when the plane
struck the next morning.

790
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,604
And you got to get away with
murder for the last 18 years.

791
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:47,443
That is quite the tale,

792
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:50,446
but all hypothetical,
as you said.

793
00:37:50,515 --> 00:37:52,782
You don't have any evidence,

794
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,950
and I haven't confessed
to anything.

795
00:37:55,019 --> 00:37:56,152
Nope, not yet.

796
00:38:00,658 --> 00:38:01,891
He's all yours, boss.

797
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,301
As predicted, Kent caved.

798
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:48,437
Yup, Gibbs only took
five minutes and a few sentences

799
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:50,606
before he got Kent to admit
to killing Ellen.

800
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:52,174
The man's a master.

801
00:38:52,243 --> 00:38:53,943
Good news, good news!

802
00:38:54,011 --> 00:38:56,979
I bring you all good news!

803
00:38:57,048 --> 00:38:59,615
All right, Jimmy,
nothing's ever that good.

804
00:38:59,684 --> 00:39:01,317
Oh, yeah?

805
00:39:01,386 --> 00:39:05,821
How about, uh, six all-access
passes to Comic-Con?

806
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,290
- Who is the man?
- Seriously?

807
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:09,825
Who? What? When? How?

808
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:13,129
Let's just say I'm friends with
a certain relative of Stan Lee,

809
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:16,065
and she was kind enough
to give us the hookup.

810
00:39:16,134 --> 00:39:17,566
Jimmy, we owe you
big time, man.

811
00:39:17,635 --> 00:39:21,570
This July, the four of us,
plus Breena and Delilah,

812
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:25,040
are gonna be fully immersed
in the comic, science-fiction,

813
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:27,476
fantasy experience.

814
00:39:27,545 --> 00:39:29,745
Oh, yeah, so I have
plans that day.

815
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:31,247
Oh, come on, what plans?

816
00:39:31,315 --> 00:39:32,681
Not sure yet.

817
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,650
So how 'bout,
uh, how 'bout Gibbs?

818
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:37,653
You think that maybe he'd want
to be our sixth, or...?

819
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:40,256
Yeah, Gibbs in cosplay,
that's-that's an image.

820
00:39:40,324 --> 00:39:42,158
Yeah. Uh, Gibbs
with pointy ears.

821
00:39:42,226 --> 00:39:43,726
I don't think that's his scene.

822
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:47,830
Don't be too sure.
With Gibbs, you never know.

823
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,971
You following me?

824
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,707
I knew
you'd be here.

825
00:41:08,145 --> 00:41:10,679
I was trying to do the
right thing for her...

826
00:41:16,587 --> 00:41:18,787
...but she still
ended up here.

827
00:41:30,234 --> 00:41:32,801
I regret that choice.

828
00:41:38,843 --> 00:41:40,976
A few more steps, boss.
