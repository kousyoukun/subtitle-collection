# "我们带来的好消息......# "

 

6

00:15099--> 00:00:17433

别害羞,

我们有足够的钱给每个人。

 

7。

00:00:17502--> 00:00:19902

圣诞老人在这里待到中午

所以慢慢来

 

8

00:00:19971--> 00:00:22071

-让路, 让路

-嘿, 你还好吗？

 

9

00:22140--> 00:00:23606

又回来了, 维西？

 

10

00:00:23674--> 00:00: 25407

那是维西斯先生给你的女士

 

11

00:25476--> 00:00:27143

后面有牛奶吗？

 

12

00:27211--> 00:00:29578

你不是来喝牛奶的, 你是来喝牛奶的。

我们都知道你为什么在这里

 

13

00:00:29647--> 00:00:31580

是的？那就叫警察吧

 

14

00:00:33 284--> 00:00:36585

真不敢相信我需要保镖

在食物线上

 

15

0000:36654--> 00:00:9054

-嘿, 杰罗姆在哪？

-我想他是在倒垃圾

 

16

0000:43227--> 00:00:45461

杰罗姆？！

 

17

00:00: 45530--> 00:00:46929

杰罗姆！

 

18

00:00:46998--> 00: 48597

我们需要我们的维和人员

 

19

00:00: 48666--> 00:00:50499

好像是我们的朋友维维西

 

20

00:00:50568--> 00:00:52412

没有得到的消息

昨天, 因为你是

 

21

00:52436--> 00:00:54403

他唯一会听的人

你能不能...？

 

22

00:56974--> 00:00: 58774

天啊。杰罗姆？

 

23

0000:58843--> 00:00000:00843

(喘不过气来):

天啊。

00:1:37748--> 00:01:39381

好吧, 最后的报告

几乎完成。

 

28

00:30:39450--> 00:01:40761

证人名单怎么样？

来吗？

 

29

00:40785--> 01:42284

我把它寄给你

马上。

 

30

00:50:42353--> 01:43919

我们的忏悔摘要怎么样了

尼 克？

 

31

00:43988--> 01:47122

我按 "打印"

三, 二, 一

 

32

00:447191--> 01:50159

啊, 最后的甜美的声音

在假期前的情况下。

 

33

01:01:50228--> 01:00:51994

杰克, 求你了, 别把我们搞砸了。

 

34

00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:54,063

If anyone needs me,

I'll either be on the slopes

 

35

00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:57,032

or drinking some damn fine

whiskey in the lodge.

 

36

00:01:57,101 --> 00:01:59,201

Christmas in Vermont, lucky you.

 

37

00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,136

- You driving up tomorrow?

- Crack of dawn.

 

38

00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,072

And I'm not even close

to being packed.

 

39

00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,733

Anyway, Merry,

Merry Christmas, all.

 

40

00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:05,475

TORRES: Hey, you, too.

 

41

00:02:05,476 --> 00:02:07,454

- Merry Christmas.

BISHOP: Sure wish I could drive.

 

42

00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:09,645

I just hate flying

on Christmas Eve.

 

43

00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:11,647

Yeah. You and me both.

Oklahoma bound?

 

44

00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:13,315

Mom has been baking all week.

You?

 

45

00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:15,050

Chicago with the in-laws.

 

46

00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:16,885

Delilah's had the twins there

since Hanukkah.

 

47

00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:18,887

We're talking

two whole weeks.

 

48

00:02:18,956 --> 00:02:21,235

I'm sure you didn't mind, uh,

a little break from the kids.

 

49

00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:22,636

Well, the first day

was nice and quiet,

 

50

00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,471

but every day since then is

a little too quiet.

 

51

00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:25,427

You'll know what

I mean someday.

 

52

00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:27,329

Yeah, no.

 

53

00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:29,999

玩坎迪兰

帕默的孩子

 

54

00:30067--> 00:02:31700

圣诞节后, 呃, 晚餐,

那是, 呃,

 

55

00:20:31769--> 00:202:33402

为我做大量的育儿

(咯咯笑)

 

56

00:05:33471--> 00:055:35537

我只是喜欢吉米的

让你过来

 

57

00:35606--> 00:37384

哦, 我只是爱

你让它听起来像一个,

 

58

00:37408--> 0:01:9041

就像个慈善案件哦, 我的天啊

 

59

00:39110--> 00:02:4042

好。

 

60

00:40511--> 00:02:42611

最后一点文书工作东佐

 

61

00:42680--> 00:06:46682

好了, 伙计们第一轮

蛋酒在这家伙身上

 

62

00:47751--> 00:02:499084

哦, 算上我吧

 

63

00:49153--> 00:02:50452

哇。

我以为你应该

 

64

00:50521--> 00:02:51920

现在已经到了纽约

 

65

00:02/51989--> 00:05:54089

改变计划。

我妈妈和妹妹决定

 

66

00:54158--> 00:05:506058

去巡航

所以我决定

 

67

00:502:56127--> 00:07860

待在这里

并赶上工作。

 

68

00:07928--> 03:01196

嘿。任何人都不应该工作

在圣诞节的时候

 

69

07:01:01265--> 07:00:03010

是啊, 任何人都不应该

制定蛋酒计划

 

70

00:003034--> 0:01:04366

在工作日的中午之前。

 

71

00:004435--> 0:03:06302

你太担心金星了

麦基。

 

72

00:03:06370--> 00:03:07569

托雷斯：

是的。放松点, 麦基

 

73

00:01:07638--> 100:0037/09 271

听着这是一个众所周知的事实

 

74

00:09340--> 00:03:11740

犯罪率下降

在节假日期间。

 

75

00:100:1009--> 00:03:14310

事实上, 正好相反

是真实的。

 

76

00:2003--> 00:16023

-但一个人可以做梦

伙计们, 相信我

 

77

00:16047--> 03:18147

好？现在是蛋酒的时候了。

我们是东佐。

 

78

00:18215--> 03:1948

吉布斯：

不, 我们不是。

 

79

00:03:19517--> 00:03:1216

死海军兽医

在哥伦比亚高地。

 

80

00:21285--> 03:23552

海军老兵, 老大？

 

81

00:23621--> 00:03:24931

这并不总是

我们的司法管辖权。

 

82

00:24955--> 00:03:27323

嗯, 就在今天。

 

83

00:27391--> 00:03:29258

mpd 被猛击。

 

84

00:29327-> 03:2394

嗯。好吧, 希望它是

一个打开和关闭的情况下。

 

85

00:32463--> 03:34830

啊！

别把我们搞砸了

 

86

00:366334--> 00:38634

天。。。

 

87

00:42573--> 00:03:43784

杰罗姆的纹身

让我想起了他的服务。

 

88

00:403:43808--> 00:03:46008

这似乎是对的

打电话给你们

 

89

00:40:46077--> 00:03:48510

大家伙。

 

90

00:03:48579--> 00:00:49978

neera:

他是一只大泰迪熊。

 

91

00:03:50047--> 00:03:51146

大刀伤

 

92

00:5051215--> 03:52225

他有多久了？

在这里工作？

 

93

00:52249--> 00:03:53916

大概三年吧

 

94

00:50584-> 00:053:56318

但严格地说

作为一名志愿者

 

95

00:503787-> 00:588 21

Budget didn't cover

guardian angels.

 

96

00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:03,792

That's what he was...

to everyone.

 

97

00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:07,529

Boss, found this knife tossed

in a storm drain back there.

 

98

00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:09,098

Could be the murder weapon.

 

99

00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,133

Oh, well, all we need now

is a suspect.

 

100

00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:13,669

- Jerome had enemies?

- No, none.

 

101

00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:15,771

I mean, except for the

neighborhood drug dealers

 

102

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,840

he was always trying

to keep out of here.

 

103

00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:19,441

You know, come

to think of it,

 

104

00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,054

one of them was back

again just this morning

 

105

00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:22,978

after Jerome had tossed

him out yesterday.

 

106

00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:24,680

A-a guy they call "Vicious."

 

107

00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:26,048

On it.

 

108

00:04:26,117 --> 00:04:27,861

NEERA: After everything

Jerome had overcome--

 

109

00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:29,718

PTSD, alcohol.

 

110

00:04:29,787 --> 00:04:31,653

He even got himself a

bed at the local V.A.

 

111

00:04:31,722 --> 00:04:34,490

And... now this.

 

112

00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,061

Hey. You got anything, McGee?

 

113

00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,295

One second.

 

114

00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:41,964

It's still loading.

 

115

00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,899

All right, there we go.

Here it is.

 

116

00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:46,969

Street name "Vicious,"

real name Albert Leary.

 

117

00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,782

He's got a long rap sheet

and a last known address

 

118

00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:49,806

not far from here.

 

119

00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:50,917

NEERA: That's him.

Th-That's Vicious.

 

120

00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:52,841

Bishop, Torres, you're with me.

 

121

00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,010

McGee, the V.A. center where

Jerome was staying,

 

122

00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,211

see what you can find.

 

123

00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,347

Let me get you the address.

 

124

00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:06,588

Hey, don't worry about it, guys,

I got this.

 

125

00:05:07,758 --> 00:05:09,324

VICIOUS:

<i>I'm telling you now.</i>

 

126

00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,593

Ain't nobody coming in here

without a warrant.

 

127

00:05:11,662 --> 00:05:13,095

Why do they call you Vicious?

 

128

00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:14,596

Yeah. I wish I knew, baby.

 

129

00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:16,365

You're looking at

a law-abiding citizen.

 

130

00:05:16,434 --> 00:05:18,667

Maybe it's because

you're a vicious liar.

 

131

00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,769

I ain't lying, <i>mijo.</i>

Me and Jerome maybe had

 

132

00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:22,571

a little misunderstanding

the other day,

 

133

00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,006

but I ain't never killed nobody.

 

134

00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,407

- Did he just...?

- Mm-hmm.

 

135

00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:26,842

Did you just call me <i>"mijo"?</i>

 

136

00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,343

Yeah, and you just

called me a liar.

 

137

00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:29,923

Now if you don't mind,

I got things to do.

 

138

00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:31,880

We mind.

 

139

00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:33,615

Get your foot up

out of my door, man.

 

140

00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:35,050

Get your door off my foot.

 

141

00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,585

(grunts)

 

142

00:05:36,654 --> 00:05:38,153

We have some questions.

 

143

00:05:38,222 --> 00:05:40,422

Fine. Hell with it.

Come on in.

 

144

00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:42,424

See? I got nothing.

 

145

00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:44,460

But I'm still calling my

lawyer to sue your asses,

 

146

00:05:44,528 --> 00:05:46,128

'cause I know my damn rights.

 

147

00:05:46,197 --> 00:05:47,597

Yeah, one would hope so

since you've

 

148

00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:48,975

had them read to you

so many times.

 

149

00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:50,032

Damn.

 

150

00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,800

GIBBS:

If you didn't kill Jerome,

 

151

00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:53,847

what were you doing at the

homeless shelter this morning?

 

152

00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:55,637

Getting breakfast. That a crime?

 

153

00:05:55,706 --> 00:05:56,872

You don't look very homeless.

 

154

00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:58,941

Hey, yo, law man,

I got a problem here.

 

155

00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:01,710

What's behind that door?

 

156

00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,378

Hey. I said you

could come in here.

 

157

00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:04,858

Back there ain't none

of your business.

 

158

00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:06,315

Yeah. Here's the issue, though.

 

159

00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:07,828

When you say that's none

of my business,

 

160

00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:09,132

it kind of makes it my business.

 

161

00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,887

Ooh.

 

162

00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:13,989

I said don't go back there.

 

163

00:06:14,058 --> 00:06:16,124

- Easy, buddy.

- Oh, yeah, now you say easy.

 

164

00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:17,537

I told you I didn't want you

in here.

 

165

00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:19,628

- Now, get out!

- A little late for that.

 

166

00:06:19,697 --> 00:06:21,763

Let's put the gun down

before this gets any worse.

 

167

00:06:21,832 --> 00:06:23,232

Put yours down!

 

168

00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,671

Bishop, you okay?

 

169

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,772

Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

 

170

00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:32,174

- Look-look at me.

- Okay.

 

171

00:06:32,243 --> 00:06:34,009

- Are you all right?

- Yeah. I'm okay.

 

172

00:06:34,078 --> 00:06:35,444

TORRES: He's dead.

(rattling)

 

173

00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,649

- Okay?

- Yeah.

 

174

00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:45,654

Ready?

 

175

00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:54,796

(baby crying)

Uh...

 

176

00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:56,798

Vicious is a dad.

 

177

00:07:08,947 --> 00:07:11,898

Hardly any way to kick off

the holidays, Gibbs.

 

178

00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,265

Understatement

of the year.

 

179

00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:14,600

And Bishop is all right?

 

180

00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:17,069

Yeah. Considering.

 

181

00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:19,905

She and Torres took the kid

to Child Services.

 

182

00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:21,265

Well, hopefully, they can

locate the baby's mother.

 

183

00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:22,742

McGEE: Hey, boss.

 

184

00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:26,111

Guess I missed some pretty

serious fireworks. Director.

 

185

00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,279

Why, McGee, where were you?

 

186

00:07:27,348 --> 00:07:29,014

I was at the, uh, V.A. center,

 

187

00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,150

collecting our victim's

personal effects.

 

188

00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:34,453

No obvious leads, but sounds

like we don't need them.

 

189

00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:35,962

Bishop and Torres seem

pretty certain

 

190

00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,990

this Vicious guy is our killer.

- They called you?

 

191

00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:39,425

No, they're, uh,

down in the lobby.

 

192

00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:40,826

Why didn't they

come up with you?

 

193

00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:43,596

Well, they kind of have

their hands full.

 

194

00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,664

Full with what?

 

195

00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,136

Ah, Gibbs, Director, hey.

 

196

00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:52,872

(quietly):

We can explain.

 

197

00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,340

What happened

to Child Services?

 

198

00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:56,509

Shh. He's sleeping.

 

199

00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:58,851

TORRES: So we were sitting

in traffic and I called them,

 

200

00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:02,047

like, five times and they put me

on hold every time, like, over and over.

 

201

00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:04,328

Yeah. They must must be really

overwhelmed this time of year.

 

202

00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:06,330

You know, so between that and

the traffic on the Beltway...

 

203

00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:09,021

TORRES: Yeah, so we figure,

bring the baby over here.

 

204

00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,991

We can find the mother way

faster than Child Services.

 

205

00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,660

And once we find her, we will

have closed the case on Vicious,

 

206

00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,328

and we can all go home

for Christmas.

 

207

00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:17,863

Oh, that kind of rhymes.

 

208

00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:19,465

So Bishop nearly

gets killed

 

209

00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:21,000

and they both went

into shock?

 

210

00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,835

No, uh, Director.

 

211

00:08:22,904 --> 00:08:24,837

This office is no place

for a baby.

 

212

00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:28,240

Though he is pretty damn cute.

 

213

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,047

Cool. So, uh, we're good?

 

214

00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:36,482

No. We are not good.

 

215

00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:37,983

We are not near good.

 

216

00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:40,319

But here we are.

 

217

00:08:40,388 --> 00:08:42,421

That baby is your

responsibility.

 

218

00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:45,991

McGee, see if you can unlock

 

219

00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,393

this creep's cell phone,

 

220

00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:49,495

and see if the mother's

in there somewhere.

 

221

00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:51,931

Nothing in his records

about marital status or kids.

 

222

00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,766

You two, go down

and check with Kasie.

 

223

00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,601

She's running prints

off the knife we found.

 

224

00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,770

Tell her to run the baby's DNA

while she's at it.

 

225

00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:00,506

- You got it, Gibbs.

McGEE: Uh, boss,

 

226

00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:03,042

someone claiming to be

Albert Leary's attorney

 

227

00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,344

wants to see his client.

Vicious.

 

228

00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:07,680

(sighs)

 

229

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,383

Any prints from

our suspect yet?

 

230

00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:13,252

I'm only just

unwrapping him now.

 

231

00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:16,021

Okay. Well, then

this must be our victim.

 

232

00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,924

Yeah. He is a

homeless vet.

 

233

00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:21,427

Apparently a real hero

down at the shelter.

 

234

00:09:22,697 --> 00:09:24,964

Um...

 

235

00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,298

Jerome Murray.

 

236

00:09:27,602 --> 00:09:29,535

Wow.

 

237

00:09:29,604 --> 00:09:31,370

Wow, what?

 

238

00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:33,372

You know him?

 

239

00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:35,808

Just, uh,

reminded me of someone.

 

240

00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,309

Yeah? Who?

 

241

00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:38,777

TORRES:

Oh, good.

 

242

00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:40,446

Kasie, you're here.

 

243

00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:43,282

Oh. Here I am.

Is that a baby?

 

244

00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:45,884

Uh, yes. Yes, it is,

and he is not coming in.

 

245

00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,720

Uh, baby, as in, like,

this guy's baby?

 

246

00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,455

I heard you found one

at his place.

 

247

00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,090

Uh, hey.

We need his DNA ASAP

 

248

00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:52,703

and whatever prints

you found on the knife.

 

249

00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:54,560

Oh, yeah. No problem.

What's the hurry?

 

250

00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:56,161

The hurry is Christmas.

 

251

00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,041

BISHOP: Well, we just need

to find the baby's mother,

 

252

00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:00,232

and confirm that Vicious

was the killer,

 

253

00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:02,334

preferably before

we leave tomorrow.

 

254

00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:06,672

Oh, he is the cutest;

what's his name?

 

255

00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:08,407

Well, we didn't get

the chance to ask,

 

256

00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:09,908

with the shooting and all.

 

257

00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:11,143

Right. I heard about that.

 

258

00:10:11,212 --> 00:10:12,578

I'm so glad you're okay.

 

259

00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:14,013

Thanks.

 

260

00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,581

You'll send me blood and prints?

 

261

00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,182

Quick as I can.

 

262

00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:22,988

I admit, Agent Gibbs, to a

rather reluctant soft spot

 

263

00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:25,591

for my pro Bono clients,

which is why I'm here.

 

264

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,026

Ah, so you're the one he called.

 

265

00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,827

Yes, and I hadn't

seen nor spoken

 

266

00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:31,463

to Albert since getting him

a plea deal months ago.

 

267

00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:34,466

Then out of the blue this

phone call and those gunshots.

 

268

00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:37,136

I went by his place and the

local P.D. pointed me here.

 

269

00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,204

Well, what can we do for you?

 

270

00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:40,639

I saw the blood.

 

271

00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,875

May I ask what happened?

Is he even alive?

 

272

00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:46,045

No. He was a suspect

in a murder investigation.

 

273

00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,881

He would not answer questions.

 

274

00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,116

He started shooting.

(scoffs)

 

275

00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:54,865

Man, you try to help these

people, and they just...

 

276

00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,689

won't be helped.

 

277

00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:59,358

He ever mention a wife,

girlfriend?

 

278

00:10:59,427 --> 00:11:01,060

Oh, couldn't tell you.

 

279

00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:05,064

Soft spot or not, I maintain

a healthy personal distance.

 

280

00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:08,300

I mean, for all I know,

Albert had ten of each.

 

281

00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:10,736

- This one would have just had a baby.

- A baby?

 

282

00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:12,504

(chuckles):

Oh, man. Come on.

 

283

00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:16,341

Again... for all I know,

he had ten of those, too.

 

284

00:11:17,645 --> 00:11:18,811

Right.

 

285

00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,213

Okay. Sorry about your client.

 

286

00:11:21,282 --> 00:11:22,214

Thank you.

 

287

00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:23,816

Oh, come to think of it,

 

288

00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:26,218

Albert said that

he was from Florida.

 

289

00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:28,387

Might be a girlfriend

down there.

 

290

00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,890

TORRES:

There you go, buddy.

 

291

00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,525

Good boy, Nicholas.

 

292

00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:35,994

Nicholas?

 

293

00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,171

Yeah, we might as well

give him a name.

 

294

00:11:38,195 --> 00:11:38,998

Hmm.

 

295

00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,166

So you name him after yourself?

 

296

00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:42,601

No, the... it's, like, NCIS.

 

297

00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,436

You know, you move

some letters around,

 

298

00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:47,873

you toss in a view.

- Mm, yeah, right, mm-hmm.

 

299

00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,610

I'd say he's more of a...

 

300

00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,413

Logan or Cody.

 

301

00:11:54,482 --> 00:11:57,082

Those are, like,

the whitest names ever.

 

302

00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:58,383

Rude.

 

303

00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,753

Well, whatever his name is,

 

304

00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,921

he is adorable.

 

305

00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,757

Isn't he cute, McGee?

 

306

00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,525

All babies are cute.

 

307

00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:08,761

Yet you won't

even look at him.

 

308

00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:11,764

Yes. That's because if we

make eye contact, I will bond,

 

309

00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:14,066

and if I bond, I'll get

distracted from this case,

 

310

00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:16,146

which in turn could prevent me

from spending Christmas

 

311

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,971

with my own two little cuties,

so let's just find his mother.

 

312

00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,039

Okay, you're right.

We got distracted.

 

313

00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,075

And, look, he's all asleep now,

 

314

00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:25,878

so... we'll be able

to get some work done.

 

315

00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,613

Careful. Babies do wake up.

 

316

00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:29,214

McGee, don't worry.

 

317

00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:30,816

We got this.

 

318

00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:32,251

Okay.

 

319

00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,453

(baby cries)

 

320

00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:35,854

TORRES:

Whoa.

 

321

00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,857

Nicholas, buddy, what happened?

 

322

00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,626

You jinxed us. Again.

 

323

00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:42,327

(flatulence)

 

324

00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:44,596

All right,

somebody put a BOLO out.

 

325

00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:46,365

- On who?

- On the 300-pound biker

 

326

00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,267

who dropped a log

in this kid's diaper.

 

327

00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,002

Oh, my God.

 

328

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,170

(sniffing)

 

329

00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,205

- Oh, no.

TORRES: No worries.

 

330

00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:54,807

We are prepared.

 

331

00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,141

(clears throat)

Here, here.

 

332

00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,609

Oh...

We got, um...

 

333

00:12:57,678 --> 00:12:58,844

we bought plenty.

 

334

00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:01,647

Oh, no.

No, these are for toddlers.

 

335

00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:03,115

These are way too big for him.

 

336

00:13:03,184 --> 00:13:04,216

Hey, uh, McGee?

 

337

00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:05,350

So, like...

 

338

00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:07,019

what do we do?

 

339

00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,821

What do you mean?

You got this.

 

340

00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:11,023

(groans)

 

341

00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,691

Jimmy.

 

342

00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,899

(baby crying)

Ah, come on, buddy.

 

343

00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,068

It's nice to know I

haven't lost my touch.

 

344

00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:26,004

Yeah, cloth diapers are so

much better than disposable,

 

345

00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:28,807

both for the environment

and for the baby.

 

346

00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:30,309

- Here, let me get that.

- What? No.

 

347

00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,844

You can't use a stapler.

 

348

00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,679

Safety pins.

Even I know that.

 

349

00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,881

Seeing as we don't

have any safety pins,

 

350

00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,382

these little

binder clips

 

351

00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:40,352

should do the trick.

 

352

00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:42,799

Palmer, what are you doing?

You're gonna pinch him. You're pinching him.

 

353

00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,627

No, it's okay.

He's probably just hungry.

 

354

00:13:44,628 --> 00:13:47,359

Oh, here,

I have his formula.

 

355

00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:48,927

Oh, no, not

that brand.

 

356

00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:52,664

No. That's filled with,

uh, preservatives, corn syrup...

 

357

00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:55,534

Yeah. Put that back.

Maybe some apple juice.

 

358

00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:58,036

That's even worse. You

might as well pour him a beer.

 

359

00:13:58,105 --> 00:13:59,571

- Hmm.

- There's so much to know.

 

360

00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,173

Yeah. So much we don't know.

 

361

00:14:01,242 --> 00:14:02,841

You guys are

new to this.

 

362

00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,077

It's like a rite of passage

for all new parents

 

363

00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:07,613

to feel inadequate.

 

364

00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:11,250

(chuckles softly)

Oh, there we go.

 

365

00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,951

BISHOP:

Hi.

 

366

00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,953

- Where is everybody?

- With Jimmy.

 

367

00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,723

Apparently, changing a diaper

is now a three-person job.

 

368

00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,024

Swell. Update.

 

369

00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:20,959

Well, no help

on the cell phone.

 

370

00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,428

Other than calling his attorney,

Vicious used it exclusively

 

371

00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:24,763

to call burn phones.

 

372

00:14:24,832 --> 00:14:27,065

No wife or girlfriend

to be found.

 

373

00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:28,767

Recheck the numbers.

 

374

00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:31,370

See if any have

a Florida area code.

 

375

00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:37,109

Boss, I hate to say this,

but I really can't miss

 

376

00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,144

my flight to Chicago

in the morning.

 

377

00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:40,712

No one's missing

anything, McGee.

 

378

00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:42,748

Once we confirm

the killer, you go,

 

379

00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:43,751

whether we find

the mother or not.

 

380

00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:44,984

Thank you.

 

381

00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:47,386

It shouldn't take too long.

Seems pretty open-and-shut.

 

382

00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,655

Oh, it doesn't <i>seem</i>

open-and-shut, Tim.

 

383

00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,890

It most definitely is.

 

384

00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,125

Fingerprints?

And blood.

 

385

00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:54,726

The latter being Jerome's,

 

386

00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:57,396

and the former matching

Vicious, our killer.

 

387

00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:59,164

Well, not a happy ending

for either party,

 

388

00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,600

but at least it's the quick case

we were hoping for.

 

389

00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:02,669

Kase, you get DNA?

 

390

00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,236

DNA came back negative.

 

391

00:15:04,305 --> 00:15:06,605

- What?

- Albert aka Vicious

 

392

00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:08,573

is most definitely

 

393

00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,275

not the baby's father,

 

394

00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:13,445

making us oh-for-two

on parents right now.

 

395

00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:16,481

BISHOP:

All right,

 

396

00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,151

here's the little man,

good as new.

 

397

00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,286

(chuckles) Yeah, no thanks

to you, McGee.

 

398

00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:27,993

Uh-oh. Nobody's smiling.

 

399

00:15:29,063 --> 00:15:30,762

What's wrong?

 

400

00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:32,864

We're looking at a stolen baby.

 

401

00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,501

Hey, wouldn't we

have heard something?

 

402

00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,269

There had to be an Amber Alert.

 

403

00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:47,937

Make that three alerts,

Director,

 

404

00:15:48,006 --> 00:15:49,606

just in the Northeast this week.

 

405

00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:51,808

But none for a newborn.

 

406

00:15:51,877 --> 00:15:54,277

I just can't believe

the statistics on missing kids.

 

407

00:15:54,346 --> 00:15:56,513

I mean, they're stolen

from hospitals, parking lots,

 

408

00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,114

people's own homes.

 

409

00:15:58,183 --> 00:16:00,116

Double-check every case.

 

410

00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:02,152

Start locally, work outward.

 

411

00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,621

I've got two cases here

in the Metro area,

 

412

00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,590

but neither matches

our baby's age or description.

 

413

00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:09,426

What kind of monster

would steal a baby?

 

414

00:16:09,494 --> 00:16:12,662

The kind dead

on Palmer's table.

 

415

00:16:12,731 --> 00:16:15,098

Whatever lowly, depraved person

you were in life,

 

416

00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,866

here's your chance in death.

 

417

00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,868

Where did you

get that baby?

 

418

00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,870

Are you really

expecting an answer?

 

419

00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,139

From beyond, maybe.

 

420

00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,008

A psychic message.

 

421

00:16:25,077 --> 00:16:27,377

At this point, I will

take what I can get.

 

422

00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:29,546

I need a word

with my buddy Jerome.

 

423

00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,492

Yeah, you mentioned that

he reminded you of someone?

 

424

00:16:31,516 --> 00:16:32,882

Oh, yeah.

Not really, though.

 

425

00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,385

But did you happen to find

anything in his clothes?

 

426

00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:38,154

Anything that might

have fallen out, maybe?

 

427

00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:39,556

Anything like...?

 

428

00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,991

Purple Heart.

This box was in his duffel

 

429

00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,660

with no medal inside.

 

430

00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:45,795

Wow. No, I didn't find

anything like that.

 

431

00:16:45,864 --> 00:16:47,341

Got me looking

into his service record,

 

432

00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:48,865

and turns out

he did not one,

 

433

00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:50,800

but three tours

in the Middle East.

 

434

00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:53,303

Purple Heart came after

an IED nearly killed him.

 

435

00:16:53,371 --> 00:16:55,572

That would explain

all the old surgical scars.

 

436

00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,042

After he was discharged,

he battled PTSD

 

437

00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:01,678

and a painkiller addiction

for years.

 

438

00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:04,547

V.A. tried to provide support,

but with no living family,

 

439

00:17:04,616 --> 00:17:07,217

he fell off the grid

entirely in '07.

 

440

00:17:07,285 --> 00:17:09,052

- Off the grid?

- Oh, homelessness.

 

441

00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:10,253

An all-too-common tale.

 

442

00:17:10,277 --> 00:17:12,421

Yeah, the numbers

are pretty staggering.

 

443

00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,257

You think the medal

might have fallen out

 

444

00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:15,470

when McGee

was packing the duffel?

 

445

00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:17,260

You know, that

or maybe Jerome

 

446

00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,696

just pawned it for cash

at some point.

 

447

00:17:19,765 --> 00:17:21,498

Yeah. But he

kept the box.

 

448

00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:23,900

So clearly, it meant

something to him.

 

449

00:17:23,969 --> 00:17:25,869

He should be buried with it.

 

450

00:17:25,937 --> 00:17:29,272

(groans)

Too late to hit the V.A. center.

 

451

00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:31,385

Yeah, we'll just have

to go over there in the morning.

 

452

00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:34,077

Uh, "we"?

Tomorrow is Christmas Eve.

 

453

00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:37,113

Okay, so we'll go

over there early.

 

454

00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:39,282

Well, the medal obviously

meant something to Jerome,

 

455

00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:40,917

which means something

to you, so...

 

456

00:17:40,986 --> 00:17:43,086

why <i>not</i> "we"?

 

457

00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,768

McGEE: All right, you bring

the blanket around,

 

458

00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:48,091

keep it nice and tight,

 

459

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,360

and there you go,

snug as a bug.

 

460

00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:52,362

He's like

a little baby burrito.

 

461

00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,863

I like burritos.

 

462

00:17:53,932 --> 00:17:54,932

Look how secure he looks.

 

463

00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,611

Like he's back in the womb.

There you go, buddy.

 

464

00:17:56,635 --> 00:17:58,601

GIBBS: Hey. Don't

you got to get going?

 

465

00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,537

Uh, yeah, boss.

Got an early flight

 

466

00:18:00,605 --> 00:18:02,972

to catch-- still got to pack.

 

467

00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,942

But, uh, I know you'll find

the mother before then, so...

 

468

00:18:06,011 --> 00:18:07,977

Go, McGee.

Say hi to your family.

 

469

00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,046

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas, boss.

 

470

00:18:10,115 --> 00:18:11,047

Happy holidays, guys.

 

471

00:18:11,116 --> 00:18:12,048

See ya.

Bye, McGee.

 

472

00:18:12,117 --> 00:18:13,117

What about you?

 

473

00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:14,162

What time's your plane leave?

 

474

00:18:14,186 --> 00:18:15,496

Uh, whenever.

I can book a later one.

 

475

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,654

You know, I still think

 

476

00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,956

Child Services

is the best place for him.

 

477

00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:21,457

BISHOP:

Ooh, and we

 

478

00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:22,992

respectfully disagree.

 

479

00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,839

"I mean, where are they

gonna put him, anyway?

 

480

00:18:24,863 --> 00:18:26,162

He's already been

through so much

 

481

00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,630

to be handed off

to some stranger.

 

482

00:18:27,699 --> 00:18:29,499

Little Nicky's place

is right here.

 

483

00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:31,501

Oh. Now he's Little Nicky?

 

484

00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,102

Okay, I get it, but...

 

485

00:18:33,171 --> 00:18:34,571

he can't stay here.

 

486

00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:36,840

Which one of you

gonna take him home?

 

487

00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:40,243

Well, your place isn't exactly,

uh, baby-friendly.

 

488

00:18:40,312 --> 00:18:42,478

And your place

is no day care center.

 

489

00:18:42,547 --> 00:18:44,180

And neither one of you

 

490

00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,349

know how to take care of a baby.

 

491

00:18:51,156 --> 00:18:52,255

Nope.

 

492

00:18:52,324 --> 00:18:53,523

(chuckles):

No.

 

493

00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,658

Not gonna happen. N...

 

494

00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:57,694

I'm not doing it.

 

495

00:18:57,796 --> 00:18:58,828

(baby fussing)

 

496

00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,598

No.

 

497

00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,600

TORRES: Yeah, this is

more like it.

 

498

00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:06,302

No. More like it

would be you tending the fire

 

499

00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:08,171

and me holding the baby.

 

500

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,141

And since when do you care about

stereotypical gender roles?

 

501

00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:15,378

(groans)

 

502

00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:16,846

Whoa.

 

503

00:19:16,915 --> 00:19:19,482

Whew. Remind me

to clean out the attic.

 

504

00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:24,954

You still have this.

 

505

00:19:25,023 --> 00:19:26,556

Got to hold on

to what you can.

 

506

00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,892

You know, it might be a

better idea to set this up

 

507

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,004

in the spare

bedroom upstairs.

 

508

00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:31,194

Uh, we were also

thinking that

 

509

00:19:31,263 --> 00:19:33,196

maybe, uh,

down here could be

 

510

00:19:33,265 --> 00:19:34,731

a little bit more

cozy, plus...

 

511

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,470

you know, the three of us

can take shifts.

 

512

00:19:36,546 --> 00:19:38,102

Shifts?

 

513

00:19:38,103 --> 00:19:40,403

Yeah. Like... you know,

like, every few hours.

 

514

00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:41,537

Yeah.

 

515

00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,805

No.

 

516

00:19:42,874 --> 00:19:44,173

No shift for me.

 

517

00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:45,909

No, I'll be in the basement.

 

518

00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,510

Night.

 

519

00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:59,889

(Bishop sighs)

 

520

00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,858

- What?

- Huh?

 

521

00:20:01,927 --> 00:20:03,593

You sighed.

 

522

00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:04,761

I didn't sigh.

 

523

00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,931

Okay, I sighed.

 

524

00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,199

I was just thinking

about what Gibbs said

 

525

00:20:10,268 --> 00:20:12,101

about hanging on

to what you can.

 

526

00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,836

Talking about the bassinet?

 

527

00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:15,905

His daughter's bassinet.

 

528

00:20:15,974 --> 00:20:17,674

Mm...

 

529

00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:18,841

his ornaments.

 

530

00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,410

You know, Shannon and Kelly,

 

531

00:20:20,478 --> 00:20:22,679

they've been gone

for so many years, but...

 

532

00:20:22,747 --> 00:20:25,381

he keeps them

right there up on the tree.

 

533

00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:26,916

Forever means forever.

 

534

00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,888

I almost died today, Nick.

 

535

00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:35,191

I'm trying

not to think about it.

 

536

00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,193

Yeah, you and me both.

 

537

00:20:37,262 --> 00:20:39,062

And that baby...

 

538

00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,564

made it a lot easier.

 

539

00:20:43,168 --> 00:20:45,234

But it can't help

but make a person

 

540

00:20:45,303 --> 00:20:47,537

reassess things,

you know?

 

541

00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:49,205

Things like...?

 

542

00:20:49,274 --> 00:20:50,807

Like what you just said.

 

543

00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,742

Forever.

 

544

00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:57,146

What we hold on to,

what we leave behind.

 

545

00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,748

- And?

- And...

 

546

00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:00,283

I don't know.

 

547

00:21:00,352 --> 00:21:03,086

I always thought

I'd be a mom someday,

 

548

00:21:03,154 --> 00:21:05,955

but... I never really

pictured myself,

 

549

00:21:06,024 --> 00:21:07,724

like, mothering,

you know?

 

550

00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:09,926

(chuckles)

Hmm.

 

551

00:21:09,995 --> 00:21:13,296

Well, after today, I feel pretty

much prepared for anything.

 

552

00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,333

(crying)

Ay.

 

553

00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:18,935

Right on cue.

 

554

00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,575

You know,

I never saw any medals.

 

555

00:21:25,643 --> 00:21:28,111

<i>But</i> maybe that nice agent

who was here yesterday,

 

556

00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:29,679

maybe he dropped them.

 

557

00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:32,482

You might want

to look around Jerome's bed.

 

558

00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,117

Thanks so much.

We shouldn't be long.

 

559

00:21:34,185 --> 00:21:35,918

I must say,

I've been having some challenges

 

560

00:21:35,987 --> 00:21:37,854

just trying to find

his next of kin

 

561

00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,523

to notify.

Jerome didn't have any.

 

562

00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:42,959

Parents died

before he was enlisted

 

563

00:21:43,028 --> 00:21:45,294

and no siblings or cousins

on record.

 

564

00:21:45,363 --> 00:21:47,675

- You saved me some trouble.

- But if you need a point person

 

565

00:21:47,699 --> 00:21:49,766

for funeral plans, I'm here...

Uh, no, no, no.

 

566

00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:51,968

No, no, the V.A.

will handle everything.

 

567

00:21:52,037 --> 00:21:53,736

They'll come and pick up

Jerome's body

 

568

00:21:53,805 --> 00:21:55,138

right after Christmas.

 

569

00:21:55,206 --> 00:21:57,206

(phone ringing)

Ah. Excuse me.

 

570

00:22:00,912 --> 00:22:04,147

Well, that was certainly

nice of you to offer.

 

571

00:22:04,215 --> 00:22:05,815

Man's got no one else.

 

572

00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:07,216

I'll never understand how a guy

 

573

00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,618

like Jerome

could end up homeless.

 

574

00:22:08,686 --> 00:22:10,119

You know,

some young people enlist

 

575

00:22:10,188 --> 00:22:12,388

to escape a bad homelife

or neighborhood.

 

576

00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,290

They get some structure,

some discipline,

 

577

00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:17,060

only to be discharged

and come back to

 

578

00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,728

none of those things.

 

579

00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:22,465

Same bad homelife,

same low prospects.

 

580

00:22:22,534 --> 00:22:24,233

Only for some of them,

it's compounded

 

581

00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:27,203

by the emotional

and physical wounds of combat.

 

582

00:22:27,272 --> 00:22:29,906

You sure know a lot

about this subject.

 

583

00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,041

My, uh... my dad did.

 

584

00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,643

Wait. Was he

ever homeless?

 

585

00:22:33,711 --> 00:22:36,712

No, but he always said

he could have been.

 

586

00:22:36,781 --> 00:22:38,881

Struggled himself

after serving.

 

587

00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,185

Then he got a job with the post

office and started a family.

 

588

00:22:42,253 --> 00:22:44,353

But he counseled homeless

veterans on the side.

 

589

00:22:44,422 --> 00:22:47,657

He was helping 'em

get a leg up, he'd say.

 

590

00:22:47,725 --> 00:22:50,693

So that's why

we're here.

 

591

00:22:50,762 --> 00:22:52,695

<i>This</i> is something your

dad would have done.

 

592

00:22:53,798 --> 00:22:55,932

Maybe.

 

593

00:22:58,403 --> 00:23:00,236

Is it true what I just heard?

 

594

00:23:01,406 --> 00:23:03,706

Vicious killed Jerome?

 

595

00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:05,408

It appears to be the case, yeah.

 

596

00:23:05,477 --> 00:23:07,110

So Jerome did it.

 

597

00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,512

He went and ratted Vicious out

to the cops.

 

598

00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:11,414

Uh, ratted him out?

 

599

00:23:11,483 --> 00:23:13,883

Jerome was kicking himself

for not stopping it right away.

 

600

00:23:13,952 --> 00:23:16,352

- Stopping what?

- Whatever he saw Vicious do.

 

601

00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:18,955

He wouldn't say what, but Jerome

told me right here in this room

 

602

00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,756

he planned to go

to the cops about it.

 

603

00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,125

And now he's dead.

 

604

00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:23,693

Wait, wait.

 

605

00:23:23,761 --> 00:23:25,761

Whatever Jerome saw,

 

606

00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,097

did he happen to

say where and when?

 

607

00:23:29,968 --> 00:23:32,435

Jack?

 

611

00:23:40,311 --> 00:23:42,545

Hey, what about skiing

in Vermont?

 

612

00:23:42,614 --> 00:23:44,647

Oh, I made the mistake

of checking in

 

613

00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,983

with Vance before

leaving this morning.

 

614

00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,731

(phone rings)

One mention of a stolen baby,

 

615

00:23:48,786 --> 00:23:50,931

and I thought you guys might be

a little shorthanded, so...

 

616

00:23:50,955 --> 00:23:53,322

Hey. Yeah, Palmer,

what do you got?

 

617

00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:58,594

So you came all the way back

for, uh, the case or the baby?

 

618

00:23:58,663 --> 00:24:01,097

Aw, come on.

Who doesn't love a baby?

 

619

00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,232

I especially love a baby

 

620

00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:05,601

in a safe and happy home.

 

621

00:24:05,703 --> 00:24:08,938

Yeah, which we're still

no closer to finding. (baby cooing)

 

622

00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:10,339

Palmer found a witness.

 

623

00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:11,908

We need to dig up

security footage

 

624

00:24:11,976 --> 00:24:13,476

from an all-night store

in Annandale.

 

625

00:24:13,545 --> 00:24:14,722

TORRES:

What are we digging for?

 

626

00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:15,845

Anything we can find

 

627

00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:16,979

on Vicious or our victim.

 

628

00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:18,681

(door opens)

 

629

00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,229

Hey, guys.

 

630

00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,955

McGee?

 

631

00:24:20,979 --> 00:24:23,720

Couldn't sleep a wink,

so, uh, booked a later flight.

 

632

00:24:23,721 --> 00:24:26,489

What happened? I thought you

were supposed to be in Vermont.

 

633

00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:29,192

Oh.

 

634

00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:36,766

Any luck, Tim?

 

635

00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:39,835

Well, took some doing, but

fortunately, there is only one

 

636

00:24:39,904 --> 00:24:42,538

Atlantic E-Z Mart in Annandale.

You said the parking lot, boss?

 

637

00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,351

That's what Palmer said.

Around 3:00 in the morning.

 

638

00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:47,777

Hard to know

what we're looking for exactly.

 

639

00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:49,946

(sighs heavily)

 

640

00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:54,350

Slow it down.

 

641

00:24:55,553 --> 00:24:57,520

Who's that?

 

642

00:24:57,589 --> 00:24:58,688

Do we know her?

 

643

00:25:00,592 --> 00:25:02,525

Nope, not yet.

 

644

00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,532

Well, that's our guy

right there.

 

645

00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:11,500

That is Vicious.

 

646

00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:12,569

He's taking the baby.

 

647

00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:16,472

I'm gonna be sick.

 

648

00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:18,507

Here comes Jerome.

 

649

00:25:18,576 --> 00:25:20,509

Wait. What is she doing?

 

650

00:25:20,578 --> 00:25:22,545

McGEE:

He's giving her an envelope.

 

651

00:25:22,614 --> 00:25:25,414

And she's... she's letting him

take the stroller.

 

652

00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:27,883

Oh, my God,

that baby wasn't stolen.

 

653

00:25:27,952 --> 00:25:31,354

McGEE:

Boss, that's got to be money.

 

654

00:25:31,422 --> 00:25:32,922

He was sold.

 

655

00:25:43,092 --> 00:25:45,553

I cannot imagine

what this girl's been through

 

656

00:25:45,554 --> 00:25:46,886

to want to sell her baby.

 

657

00:25:46,955 --> 00:25:48,355

You got anything?

 

658

00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:50,223

Uh, the only prints

on this stroller belong

 

659

00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:52,892

to Bishop and Torres,

and no hits on DNA, either.

 

660

00:25:52,961 --> 00:25:54,828

Facial recognition?

 

661

00:25:54,896 --> 00:25:57,063

KASIE:

No matches yet.

 

662

00:25:57,132 --> 00:26:00,533

What's that about?

Oh, that? That's nothing.

 

663

00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:02,736

It's not nothing.

She's trying

 

664

00:26:02,804 --> 00:26:04,771

to find a Purple Heart,

Agent Gibbs, for Jerome.

 

665

00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,206

You can buy one online for,

 

666

00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:07,407

like, 50 bucks,

 

667

00:26:07,476 --> 00:26:09,409

but delivery this time of year

takes weeks.

 

668

00:26:09,478 --> 00:26:11,678

Why does Jerome

need a Purple Heart?

 

669

00:26:11,747 --> 00:26:14,280

Because he earned it,

and lost it.

 

670

00:26:14,349 --> 00:26:16,383

(phone ringing)

 

671

00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:19,252

Yeah. Yeah.

 

672

00:26:19,321 --> 00:26:21,254

Leon, I'm on my way.

 

673

00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:27,394

What?

 

674

00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:30,563

You're such a sweet boy.

 

675

00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:32,532

Well, so much for your ski trip.

 

676

00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:34,467

And McGee,

what about Chicago?

 

677

00:26:34,536 --> 00:26:35,802

What can we say, Leon?

 

678

00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:37,391

We're here

for the same reason you are.

 

679

00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:38,872

Doubtful. I'm pulling the plug.

 

680

00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,440

- What?

- This is what

 

681

00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:42,794

Child Protective Services does.

It's right there in their title.

 

682

00:26:42,795 --> 00:26:43,529

But, Director...

 

683

00:26:43,553 --> 00:26:45,846

No, I'm not gonna waste

any more of our time,

 

684

00:26:45,847 --> 00:26:47,781

our resources,

and all of our holidays

 

685

00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:49,482

trying to do what they do best.

 

686

00:26:51,219 --> 00:26:53,820

I'm not sure you'd say that

if you saw the video.

 

687

00:26:53,889 --> 00:26:55,455

The mother was

sobbing, Director.

 

688

00:26:55,524 --> 00:26:57,457

There has to be more

to the story.

 

689

00:26:57,526 --> 00:26:59,092

Certainly <i>her</i> story.

 

690

00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:00,326

BISHOP:

Hey.

 

691

00:27:00,395 --> 00:27:02,462

So, no witnesses,

 

692

00:27:02,531 --> 00:27:04,831

and we all but papered the walls

of the convenience store

 

693

00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,711

and the neighborhood around it.

Nobody knows her.

 

694

00:27:06,735 --> 00:27:08,735

How's my Little Nicky?

 

695

00:27:08,804 --> 00:27:11,304

Hmm. Looks more

like a Logan to me.

 

696

00:27:11,373 --> 00:27:13,173

BISHOP: Hey! I was

thinking Logan, too.

 

697

00:27:13,241 --> 00:27:15,575

- Yeah.

- Yeah, or like a Cody.

 

698

00:27:15,644 --> 00:27:17,221

See, I'm thinking

he looks more like a Luke.

 

699

00:27:17,245 --> 00:27:18,745

Oh, another <i>Star Wars</i> name, huh?

 

700

00:27:18,814 --> 00:27:21,114

Well, I believe, uh,

Logan is Wolverine.

 

701

00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:23,483

How about, uh, Superman?

Kent? Clark?

 

702

00:27:23,552 --> 00:27:25,618

VANCE:

Well, we may not have found

 

703

00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:28,421

the mom yet, Gibbs, but this

baby certainly has no shortage

 

704

00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,989

of aunts and uncles.

 

705

00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,626

Hey, Superman.

 

706

00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:37,130

Let's just call him Superman.

Albert's a better name.

 

707

00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:39,332

I'm just saying, there was

no need to involve Gibbs.

 

708

00:27:39,401 --> 00:27:41,301

There is always a need.

 

709

00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:43,269

Look, if you want to help

Jerome, Kasie, you got

 

710

00:27:43,338 --> 00:27:44,982

to let other people help you.

I let <i>you</i> help me.

 

711

00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:46,539

I'm not Gibbs.

 

712

00:27:46,608 --> 00:27:48,553

Surely your dad didn't help

all these homeless vets

 

713

00:27:48,577 --> 00:27:49,976

all by himself, did he?

 

714

00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:51,511

No. I don't know.

 

715

00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,847

Look, just leave my dad

out of this.

 

716

00:27:53,915 --> 00:27:55,493

There you go again.

Every time I bring up your dad,

 

717

00:27:55,517 --> 00:27:57,317

you change the subject.

- No, I don't.

 

718

00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,719

Now find a face already.

 

719

00:27:59,788 --> 00:28:02,188

It was him, wasn't it?

 

720

00:28:02,257 --> 00:28:04,524

Who Jerome reminded you of.

 

721

00:28:04,593 --> 00:28:06,626

It was your dad.

 

722

00:28:06,695 --> 00:28:08,828

You got all weird when

 

723

00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,497

you saw Jerome's body,

the same weird

 

724

00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:12,565

that you got

at any mention of your dad.

 

725

00:28:12,634 --> 00:28:14,501

Look, I...

 

726

00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:16,035

I'm sorry.

 

727

00:28:16,104 --> 00:28:17,871

I overstepped there.

I didn't mean to...

 

728

00:28:17,939 --> 00:28:20,540

No. No, you're right.

 

729

00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:22,475

I get weird.

 

730

00:28:22,544 --> 00:28:24,177

(sighs heavily)

 

731

00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:27,046

Jerome reminded me of

the first dead body I ever saw.

 

732

00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:29,315

It was your father.

 

733

00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:32,585

About the same age, Navy tattoo.

 

734

00:28:32,654 --> 00:28:34,654

(sighs)

 

735

00:28:34,723 --> 00:28:37,323

It just reminded me

of our last Christmas together.

 

736

00:28:37,392 --> 00:28:39,392

In the middle

of opening presents,

 

737

00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:41,127

I mentioned

having second thoughts

 

738

00:28:41,196 --> 00:28:44,564

about finishing grad school,

and he was... he was not happy.

 

739

00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:46,566

(sniffles)

 

740

00:28:46,635 --> 00:28:48,768

You know, he always said

I had a knack

 

741

00:28:48,837 --> 00:28:51,037

if I would just

apply myself, and...

 

742

00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:54,240

oh, needless to say,

it ruined the day,

 

743

00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:58,211

and most every day after that,

 

744

00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,046

right up till the day he died.

 

745

00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:03,283

- When was that?

- (crying): A month later, out of nowhere.

 

746

00:29:03,351 --> 00:29:06,553

Just had a heart attack

on his mail route.

 

747

00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:08,254

(sniffles)

You know, the medics said

 

748

00:29:08,323 --> 00:29:10,790

that he was dead

before he even hit the ground.

 

749

00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:13,359

Mom couldn't bear to I.D.

the body, so I did.

 

750

00:29:13,428 --> 00:29:16,062

Kasie, I'm so sorry.

 

751

00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:18,898

You know, the day after that,

I went back to grad school,

 

752

00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,467

and I busted my butt,

and he was right.

 

753

00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,937

I had a knack.

 

754

00:29:24,005 --> 00:29:27,240

And within a week, I started

working with Ducky, and...

 

755

00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:28,942

man, I knew in my heart

 

756

00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,144

that I was on the right track

after all.

 

757

00:29:31,213 --> 00:29:34,714

Wait. All of this

was a year ago?

 

758

00:29:34,783 --> 00:29:36,716

Last Christmas, yeah.

(sniffles)

 

759

00:29:36,785 --> 00:29:38,051

Well, there you go. Kasie,

 

760

00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,430

that's why

you don't want to go home.

 

761

00:29:39,454 --> 00:29:41,621

No, I-I... I have

work to do, and I...

 

762

00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,623

No. No, you don't.

 

763

00:29:43,692 --> 00:29:45,158

And your mom and your sister--

 

764

00:29:45,227 --> 00:29:46,938

they're-they're not going

on any cruise, are they?

 

765

00:29:46,962 --> 00:29:49,629

I just... I know it's gonna be

a rough Christmas.

 

766

00:29:49,698 --> 00:29:52,498

(computer chirps)

 

767

00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:54,434

There we go.

Got a hit.

 

768

00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:56,769

(sniffles)

Uh,

 

769

00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:59,239

Tanya Jacobs, 17.

 

770

00:29:59,307 --> 00:30:01,608

Three trips to juvie

for drug offenses.

 

771

00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:03,910

GIBBS: Yeah, Palmer.

What do you got?

 

772

00:30:03,979 --> 00:30:05,678

We're sure

it's the same Tanya?

 

773

00:30:05,747 --> 00:30:08,448

Her I.D. and probation number

were used to check in yesterday.

 

774

00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:13,586

She knows we're here.

Manager must have called.

 

775

00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:17,357

Tanya Jacobs! NCIS!

 

776

00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,860

- Tanya!

- Please let me go! Let me go!

 

777

00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:22,629

It's okay.

Tanya, it's okay.

 

778

00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:24,664

It's not okay.

Leave me alone, please!

 

779

00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:26,666

Hey, hey, we just

want to talk.

 

780

00:30:31,172 --> 00:30:34,307

It's not mine,

I swear. I swear.

 

781

00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:36,209

It's okay.

 

782

00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:37,944

(crying)

 

783

00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:49,973

You pretty high

right now, Tanya?

 

784

00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,389

I'm not high at all.

 

785

00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:53,525

I've been clean for months.

 

786

00:30:53,593 --> 00:30:55,927

There anybody we can call?

 

787

00:30:55,996 --> 00:30:58,596

- Parents?

- Yeah. Yeah, right.

 

788

00:30:58,665 --> 00:31:02,567

No. They kicked me out

as soon as I got pregnant.

 

789

00:31:02,636 --> 00:31:05,436

Then my boyfriend

skipped town.

 

790

00:31:05,505 --> 00:31:08,273

That's when the adoption agency

hooked me up with Pete and Judy.

 

791

00:31:08,341 --> 00:31:10,475

- Last name?

- They don't tell you that.

 

792

00:31:10,544 --> 00:31:12,977

They were nice people, though.

 

793

00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:15,413

So nice.

 

794

00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:18,917

They helped pay for my rehab

and my medical care,

 

795

00:31:18,985 --> 00:31:22,620

all just for a chance

to adopt my baby.

 

796

00:31:24,224 --> 00:31:26,491

When did Vicious come along?

 

797

00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,493

Right before I delivered.

 

798

00:31:30,063 --> 00:31:32,397

I used to be a customer

before I got clean.

 

799

00:31:32,465 --> 00:31:36,334

When he saw me knocked up,

he offered me ten grand cash.

 

800

00:31:36,403 --> 00:31:38,403

More money than

I had ever seen.

 

801

00:31:38,471 --> 00:31:40,171

So I lied.

 

802

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,908

I told Pete and Judy

that I wanted to keep the baby.

 

803

00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:46,010

And I felt bad for

breaking their hearts,

 

804

00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,779

but adoption agencies--

 

805

00:31:47,848 --> 00:31:50,648

once the baby comes,

they don't pay you.

 

806

00:31:50,717 --> 00:31:54,452

And I knew it was wrong the

second I took the envelope.

 

807

00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:57,021

But opportunities like

that, they don't...

 

808

00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,124

they don't come around

every... maybe ever.

 

809

00:32:00,193 --> 00:32:03,161

I thought I'd be okay,

 

810

00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,597

but then I found out

that Vicious was dead,

 

811

00:32:05,665 --> 00:32:08,700

and-and-and... and now I don't

even know where my baby is.

 

812

00:32:10,737 --> 00:32:12,837

Tanya, we have him.

 

813

00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,241

You do?

 

814

00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,209

Yes. He's safe.

 

815

00:32:18,278 --> 00:32:21,045

(exhales):

Wha...

 

816

00:32:21,114 --> 00:32:23,481

(laughs)

 

817

00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:26,651

What's the name of the agency?

 

818

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,653

(exhales)

 

819

00:32:28,722 --> 00:32:31,022

This changes everything.

 

820

00:32:31,091 --> 00:32:33,191

Why-why does it

change everything?

 

821

00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,293

I mean, maybe this is a sign.

 

822

00:32:35,362 --> 00:32:37,729

I've been...

I've been sitting here,

 

823

00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:40,031

and I've been thinking maybe...

 

824

00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,799

maybe if I would've

just kept my baby,

 

825

00:32:41,868 --> 00:32:44,002

then I would've saved everybody

from all this trouble.

 

826

00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,237

- No, no, no, no.

- Why not?

 

827

00:32:46,306 --> 00:32:47,906

I've got money now.

 

828

00:32:47,974 --> 00:32:49,574

I could get us a place.

 

829

00:32:49,643 --> 00:32:50,675

A nice one.

 

830

00:32:52,379 --> 00:32:54,913

I mean, maybe this-this could be

my second chance.

 

831

00:32:54,981 --> 00:32:59,384

Hey, Tanya, y-your best chance

is without a baby right now.

 

832

00:32:59,452 --> 00:33:03,388

And your baby's best chance

is with those adoptive parents.

 

833

00:33:03,456 --> 00:33:05,390

(crying)

 

834

00:33:07,294 --> 00:33:09,994

This opportunity...

 

835

00:33:10,063 --> 00:33:12,997

doesn't come around much.

 

836

00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:14,866

You have come this far,

 

837

00:33:14,935 --> 00:33:17,068

but you could go

so much further,

 

838

00:33:17,137 --> 00:33:20,571

and so could your baby.

 

839

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,007

If you let him go.

 

840

00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:29,747

You seem so sure.

How do you know?

 

841

00:33:29,816 --> 00:33:33,117

Because I know. All right?

 

842

00:33:33,186 --> 00:33:35,887

We all end up

with regrets in our life,

 

843

00:33:35,956 --> 00:33:37,622

but one thing

you will never regret

 

844

00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:41,225

is giving your baby

a better life.

 

845

00:33:43,196 --> 00:33:45,964

More than anything else,

I know that.

 

846

00:33:46,032 --> 00:33:49,400

And I'll help you get

the support you need

 

847

00:33:49,469 --> 00:33:52,470

to get clean and turn

your life around.

 

848

00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:53,871

I promise.

 

849

00:33:57,344 --> 00:33:59,944

- Okay? Okay.

- Okay, I will. Thanks.

 

850

00:34:00,013 --> 00:34:04,248

Tanya... what did Vicious

have planned for the baby?

 

851

00:34:04,317 --> 00:34:07,819

Well, that's just the thing.

It wasn't all about the money.

 

852

00:34:07,887 --> 00:34:09,954

It was to Vicious.

 

853

00:34:10,023 --> 00:34:12,090

Who was he selling the baby to?

 

854

00:34:12,158 --> 00:34:15,426

He said he had a

nice home lined up.

 

855

00:34:15,495 --> 00:34:17,061

Rich people.

 

856

00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:20,565

Like, a-a doctor

or a lawyer or something.

 

857

00:34:26,973 --> 00:34:29,474

Lawyer.

 

858

00:34:32,212 --> 00:34:34,979

Let me save you some time,

Agent Gibbs.

 

859

00:34:35,048 --> 00:34:37,181

It's already been

the worst Christmas Eve ever.

 

860

00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,017

Yeah. How?

 

861

00:34:39,085 --> 00:34:41,652

My wife figured out what kind

of strings I was pulling

 

862

00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:43,254

to make this adoption happen.

 

863

00:34:43,323 --> 00:34:46,157

You call paying a drug dealer

to buy you a baby

 

864

00:34:46,226 --> 00:34:48,159

"pulling strings"?

 

865

00:34:48,228 --> 00:34:50,194

Stupid, I know.

 

866

00:34:50,263 --> 00:34:52,697

Oh, it is way more than stupid.

After I got Albert

 

867

00:34:52,766 --> 00:34:55,967

the plea deal, he said if there

was anything he could do.

 

868

00:34:56,036 --> 00:34:57,702

And he meant anything.

 

869

00:34:57,771 --> 00:35:00,104

So you said, "How about a baby?"

 

870

00:35:00,173 --> 00:35:01,853

Our third adoption

had just fallen through,

 

871

00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:03,274

and we were crushed.

 

872

00:35:03,343 --> 00:35:04,776

Albert said

 

873

00:35:04,844 --> 00:35:07,045

for 25 grand, he would find us

 

874

00:35:07,113 --> 00:35:09,280

a healthy

and willing birth mother.

 

875

00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:10,495

$25,000.

 

876

00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:12,695

I was desperate

to give my wife a family.

 

877

00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:16,487

Never expecting

anyone was gonna die over it.

 

878

00:35:21,461 --> 00:35:23,394

JIMMY:

Hey.

 

879

00:35:23,463 --> 00:35:25,797

- Hear the good news?

- Yeah.

 

880

00:35:25,865 --> 00:35:29,367

Uh, great. I mean, bittersweet,

but at least we can find

 

881

00:35:29,436 --> 00:35:31,040

the original

adoptive parents now.

 

882

00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,455

I'm sorry.

Am I interrupting something?

 

883

00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:33,572

Oh, no. Just...

 

884

00:35:33,573 --> 00:35:36,808

just deleting a bunch of spam.

You headed home?

 

885

00:35:36,876 --> 00:35:38,543

Yeah, I just wanted to,

uh, come by.

 

886

00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:41,412

Drop off a little something.

Jimmy, why?

 

887

00:35:41,481 --> 00:35:43,815

You didn't have to.

I didn't get you anything.

 

888

00:35:43,883 --> 00:35:46,017

Yes, you did. Trust me.

 

889

00:35:46,086 --> 00:35:48,486

- Do I open it now or...?

- That would be the idea, yeah.

 

890

00:35:48,555 --> 00:35:51,422

- Just o-open it.

- Yeah. Okay. (laughs)

 

891

00:35:53,593 --> 00:35:55,893

It's not Jerome's,

 

892

00:35:55,962 --> 00:35:57,728

but it's-it's someone's.

 

893

00:35:57,797 --> 00:35:59,897

Someone who doesn't need

it anymore, I guess.

 

894

00:35:59,966 --> 00:36:02,166

- Who?

- I don't know.

 

895

00:36:02,235 --> 00:36:05,169

But that is why

you involve Gibbs.

 

896

00:36:05,238 --> 00:36:07,105

He knows people.

 

897

00:36:10,577 --> 00:36:12,343

Thank you, Jimmy.

 

898

00:36:13,446 --> 00:36:15,513

Merry Christmas.

 

899

00:36:16,816 --> 00:36:19,750

Oh, and Kasie?

 

900

00:36:19,819 --> 00:36:21,886

I'm a big believer in fate.

 

901

00:36:21,955 --> 00:36:23,888

I know there's nothing good

that can be said

 

902

00:36:23,957 --> 00:36:26,023

about your dad

passing away,

 

903

00:36:26,092 --> 00:36:29,227

but if nothing else,

it led you here.

 

904

00:36:29,295 --> 00:36:30,862

To us.

 

905

00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,932

I sometimes think maybe my dad

gave me a little...

 

906

00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:37,368

shove from above.

 

907

00:36:37,437 --> 00:36:39,370

Well, we're all glad

that he did.

 

908

00:36:47,313 --> 00:36:48,913

Hey.

 

909

00:36:48,982 --> 00:36:51,649

We've got the hang of this now.

(fusses)

 

910

00:36:51,718 --> 00:36:54,986

Yeah. He's looking stylish, too.

Aren't you, little Cody?

 

911

00:36:55,054 --> 00:36:56,220

What? Cody?

 

912

00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:58,422

Consider that

my Christmas present to you.

 

913

00:36:58,491 --> 00:37:00,091

McGEE:

Great news.

 

914

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,460

The agency tracked down

Tanya's adoptive parents.

 

915

00:37:02,529 --> 00:37:04,328

Pete and Judy Shaw

 

916

00:37:04,397 --> 00:37:06,464

of Fairfax.

They're only 20 minutes away.

 

917

00:37:06,533 --> 00:37:09,567

- Oh, that's... that's great.

- Mm-hmm.

 

918

00:37:09,636 --> 00:37:11,569

I got a plane to catch.

 

919

00:37:11,638 --> 00:37:14,972

May the Force be with you,

little Han Solo.

 

920

00:37:17,043 --> 00:37:18,943

Really good job, you guys.

 

921

00:37:19,012 --> 00:37:20,511

Thanks.

 

922

00:37:23,016 --> 00:37:26,751

Okay, then, little

guy. Here we go.

 

923

00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:29,987

Yeah, so, uh...

 

924

00:37:30,056 --> 00:37:32,190

we tell Gibbs now, right?

 

925

00:37:32,258 --> 00:37:34,358

- Mm-hmm.

- Mm-hmm.

 

926

00:37:34,427 --> 00:37:37,261

You know, they say,

"You can't take it with you."

 

927

00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:39,864

But this? (sighs)

 

928

00:37:39,933 --> 00:37:42,867

This, Jerome, you are...

 

929

00:37:42,902 --> 00:37:46,604

most definitely taking with you.

 

930

00:37:46,673 --> 00:37:50,007

Or as my father used to say...

 

931

00:37:50,076 --> 00:37:52,376

"No greater love than this,

 

932

00:37:52,445 --> 00:37:55,980

that one should lay down

his life for his friends."

 

933

00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,222

WOMAN: Hey, baby.

What's up? You okay?

 

934

00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,191

No, Mom, I'm fine, really.

I just, um...

 

935

00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,161

I actually finished that work

faster than I thought

 

936

00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,331

and was thinking maybe I could

still catch a flight home?

 

937

00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:18,002

Oh! We'd love to

have you here, sweetheart.

 

938

00:38:35,888 --> 00:38:36,988

Hey, Jack.

 

939

00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,656

Hey.

 

940

00:38:38,725 --> 00:38:40,057

You still coming?

 

941

00:38:40,126 --> 00:38:41,892

Are you kidding me?

 

942

00:38:41,961 --> 00:38:44,829

I wouldn't miss it

for the world.

 

943

00:38:49,168 --> 00:38:51,102

Special Agent Gibbs?

 

944

00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,503

Ms. Miles.

 

945

00:38:52,572 --> 00:38:55,072

Lydia, yes.

From the adoption agency.

 

946

00:38:55,141 --> 00:38:57,089

I spoke with your Agent McGee

on the phone.

 

947

00:38:57,113 --> 00:38:58,277

Special Agent Sloane.

 

948

00:38:58,278 --> 00:39:00,489

Thank you so much for arranging

this on such short notice.

 

949

00:39:00,513 --> 00:39:02,613

Of course. We were overjoyed.

 

950

00:39:02,682 --> 00:39:04,515

We worked it all out with Tanya.

 

951

00:39:04,584 --> 00:39:06,717

She spoke very highly

of you both.

 

952

00:39:06,786 --> 00:39:08,552

I take it the child is with you?

 

953

00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:10,554

- Absolutely.

- Great.

 

954

00:39:13,626 --> 00:39:15,626

All right, here we are. Hi.

Hi.

 

955

00:39:15,695 --> 00:39:18,129

Thank you so much for coming.

Thank you.

 

956

00:39:18,197 --> 00:39:20,531

- And there he is.

- Oh.

 

957

00:39:22,135 --> 00:39:24,969

Wonderful. Well,

I'll just take him from here.

 

958

00:39:25,038 --> 00:39:26,038

No.

 

959

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,473

Sorry. It's just we'd like to...

 

960

00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:31,776

deliver him ourselves,

if that's okay.

 

961

00:39:31,844 --> 00:39:34,879

Actually, that might be better.

I told the Shaws I was coming

 

962

00:39:34,947 --> 00:39:36,547

but didn't want

to get their hopes up

 

963

00:39:36,616 --> 00:39:37,782

before you got here.

 

964

00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,216

They've been let down before.

 

965

00:39:39,285 --> 00:39:40,551

Yes, we know.

 

966

00:39:42,689 --> 00:39:44,221

Why don't I just, uh, go on

 

967

00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,290

and break the good news

while you wait at the door?

 

968

00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,827

Great.

 

969

00:39:49,896 --> 00:39:51,495

This is a nice neighborhood.

 

970

00:39:51,564 --> 00:39:54,098

Good schools. I checked.

 

971

00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:57,068

- That's good. That's good to know.

- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

 

972

00:39:57,136 --> 00:39:59,103

Good schools.

That's important.

 

973

00:39:59,172 --> 00:40:00,271

Hey, you two.

 

974

00:40:01,741 --> 00:40:03,941

You should get over there.

 

975

00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,976

Right. Okay.

 

976

00:40:06,045 --> 00:40:07,511

Bye, buddy.

 

977

00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,347

(clears throat)

 

978

00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:17,121

Are you okay? Got it?

 

979

00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,457

Ooh.

 

980

00:40:19,525 --> 00:40:22,860

Oh, how adorable.

 

981

00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:25,096

(Bishop chuckles)

Congratulations.

 

982

00:40:25,164 --> 00:40:26,697

- Thank you.

- (chuckles): Thank you.

 

983

00:40:26,766 --> 00:40:29,033

Come on.

 

984

00:40:29,102 --> 00:40:30,835

That was weird.

 

985

00:40:30,903 --> 00:40:32,670

Yeah. Just kind of came out.

 

986

00:40:32,739 --> 00:40:35,272

(both chuckle)

 

987

00:40:37,543 --> 00:40:39,643

(sighs) Okay.

 

988

00:40:39,712 --> 00:40:41,846

Hey, uh, hold on.

 

989

00:40:45,084 --> 00:40:47,184

You did good.

 

990

00:40:47,253 --> 00:40:50,020

Yeah. You did, too.

 

991

00:40:50,089 --> 00:40:51,989

We both did.

 

992

00:40:54,093 --> 00:40:56,894

And you did good, too, bud.

 

993

00:40:56,963 --> 00:40:58,896

Yeah.

 

994

00:40:58,965 --> 00:41:00,331

You...

 

995

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,032

are going to a great home.

 

996

00:41:02,101 --> 00:41:04,068

You're gonna love it there.

 

997

00:41:04,137 --> 00:41:05,302

Absolutely.

 

998

00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,541

- Oh, wow.

- All right, that's not even fair, buddy.

 

999

00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,743

(exhales) Okay.

 

1000

00:41:12,812 --> 00:41:14,145

(Torres sighs)

 

1001

00:41:14,213 --> 00:41:16,013

BISHOP:

Let's go.

 

1002

00:41:16,082 --> 00:41:18,649

Pete and Judy,

 

1003

00:41:18,718 --> 00:41:20,751

these are the agents I

was telling you about.

 

1004

00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,319

They've been taking

care of your baby.

 

1005

00:41:22,388 --> 00:41:23,854

Our baby?

 

1006

00:41:23,923 --> 00:41:26,490

- Yeah, your baby.

PETE: This is, uh...

 

1007

00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:29,193

It's a miracle, right?

 

1008

00:41:32,064 --> 00:41:33,731

It's got to be a miracle.

 

1009

00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,132

Sure feels like it.

 

1010

00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,834

Does he have a name?

 

1011

00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,336

That's up to you.

 

1012

00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,072

JUDY:

Thank you.

 

1013

00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:43,674

(chuckles): Oh.

Thank you so much.

 

1014

00:41:47,847 --> 00:41:49,213

Congratulations.

 

1015

00:41:49,282 --> 00:41:52,249

(sighs)

Here.

 

1016

00:41:57,757 --> 00:42:01,192

(chuckles)

 

1017

00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,894

Merry Christmas, Gibbs.

 

1018

00:42:03,963 --> 00:42:07,031

Merry Christmas to you, Jack.

 

1019

00:42:08,935 --> 00:42:10,734

You still going skiing?

 

1020

00:42:10,803 --> 00:42:12,770

It's a little late now.

 

1021

00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:15,372

Why? You got a better plan?

 

1022

00:42:15,441 --> 00:42:17,708

I was just thinking about

that gift bottle you gave out.

 

1023

00:42:17,777 --> 00:42:19,280

- Kentucky's finest.

- Oh.

 

1024

00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:20,312

Small batch.

 

1025

00:42:20,313 --> 00:42:23,547

I want to crack that.

You in?

 

1026

00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:27,985

(laughs)
