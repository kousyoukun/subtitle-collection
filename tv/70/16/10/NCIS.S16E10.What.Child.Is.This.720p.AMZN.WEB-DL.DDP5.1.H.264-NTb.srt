93
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:03,792

00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,769
{\fs19}我没有撒谎 亲爱的 我和Jerome那天
I ain't lying, mijo. Me and Jerome maybe had

129
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:22,571
{\fs19}也许有一些小误会
a little misunderstanding the other day,

130
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,006
{\fs19}但是我没有杀任何人
but I ain't never killed nobody.

131
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,407
{\fs19}-他是不是 - 嗯哼
- Did he just...? - Mm-hmm.

132
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:26,842
{\fs19}你刚刚是不是叫我 亲爱的
Did you just call me "mijo"?

133
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,343
{\fs19}是啊 就像你刚刚说我是一个骗子
Yeah, and you just called me a liar.

134
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:29,923
{\fs19}如果你们不介意 我还有别的事情要做
Now if you don't mind, I got things to do.

135
00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:31,880
{\fs19}我们介意的
We mind.

136
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:33,615
{\fs19}把你的脚从我的门边挪开
Get your foot up out of my door, man.

137
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:35,050
{\fs19}把你的门从我的脚边挪开
Get your door off my foot.

138
00:05:36,654 --> 00:05:38,153
{\fs19}我们有一些问题
We have some questions.

139
00:05:38,222 --> 00:05:40,422
{\fs19}好吧 管他呢 进来吧
Fine. Hell with it. Come on in.

140
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:42,424
{\fs19}看到了吗 我什么都没有
See? I got nothing.

141
00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:44,460
{\fs19}但是我仍然要打电话给我的律师去起诉你们
But I'm still calling my lawyer to sue your asses,

142
00:05:44,528 --> 00:05:46,128
{\fs19}因为我知道我的权利
'cause I know my damn rights.

143
00:05:46,197 --> 00:05:47,597
{\fs19}是啊 既然他们已经给你说过
Yeah, one would hope so since you've

144
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:48,975
{\fs19}那么多次了 希望你记住了
had them read to you so many times.

145
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:50,032
{\fs19}该死的
Damn.

146
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,800
{\fs19}如果你没有杀 Jerome
If you didn't kill Jerome,

147
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:53,847
{\fs19}你今天早上在流浪人员的避难所干什么
what were you doing at the homeless shelter this morning?

148
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:55,637
{\fs19}取早餐 这是犯罪行为吗
Getting breakfast. That a crime?

149
00:05:55,706 --> 00:05:56,872
{\fs19}你看上去并不不是流浪人员
You don't look very homeless.

150
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:58,941
{\fs19}嗨 律师 我这儿有一个问题
Hey, yo, law man, I got a problem here.

151
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:01,710
{\fs19}这个门后面是什么
What's behind that door?

152
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,378
{\fs19}嗨 我说了你可以进来
Hey. I said you could come in here.

153
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:04,858
{\fs19}但是门后和你没有任何关系
Back there ain't none of your business.

154
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:06,315
{\fs19}是吗 那我们就有问题了
Yeah. Here's the issue, though.

155
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:07,828
{\fs19}当你说和我没有关系的时候
When you say that's none of my business,

156
00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:09,132
{\fs19}这就和我有关系了
it kind of makes it my business.

157
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,887
{\fs19}哇哦
Ooh.

158
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:13,989
{\fs19}我说了 不要进去
I said don't go back there.

159
00:06:14,058 --> 00:06:16,124
{\fs19}-放松点 伙计 -噢 你现在说放松点了
- Easy, buddy. - Oh, yeah, now you say easy.

160
00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:17,537
{\fs19}我告诉了你 我不希望你进来
I told you I didn't want you in here.

161
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:19,628
{\fs19}-现在给我出去 -现在说这个有点晚了呢
- Now, get out! - A little late for that.

162
00:06:19,697 --> 00:06:21,763
{\fs19}在事态恶化前 我们先把枪放下
Let's put the gun down before this gets any worse.

163
00:06:21,832 --> 00:06:23,232
{\fs19}你们把枪放下
Put yours down!

164
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,671
{\fs19}Bishop 你还好吗
Bishop, you okay?

165
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,772
{\fs19}是的 没事 没事
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

166
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:32,174
{\fs19}-看着 看着我 -好的
- Look-look at me. - Okay.

167
00:06:32,243 --> 00:06:34,009
{\fs19}-你还好吗 -是的 我没事
- Are you all right? - Yeah. I'm okay.

168
00:06:34,078 --> 00:06:35,444
{\fs19}他死了
He's dead.

169
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,649
{\fs19}-真的没事 -没事
- Okay? - Yeah.

170
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:45,654
{\fs19}准备好了吗
Ready?

171
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:54,796
{\fs19}呃
Uh...

172
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:56,798
{\fs19}Vicious 是个做了爸爸的人
Vicious is a dad.

173
00:07:08,947 --> 00:07:11,898
{\fs19}真不是个开始假期的好方式 Gibbs
Hardly any way to kick off the holidays, Gibbs.

174
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,265
{\fs19}本年度最轻描淡写的说法了吧
Understatement of the year.

175
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:14,600
{\fs19}Bishop没事吧
And Bishop is all right?

176
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:17,069
{\fs19}是的 相对来说没事
Yeah. Considering.

177
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:19,905
{\fs19}她和Torres把孩子带到了儿童服务机构
She and Torres took the kid to Child Services.

178
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:21,265
{\fs19}但愿他们能找到孩子的母亲
Well, hopefully, they can locate the baby's mother.

179
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:22,742
{\fs19}嘿 老大
Hey, boss.

180
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:26,111
{\fs19}看起来我错过了一场严重的枪战 主任
Guess I missed some pretty serious fireworks. Director.

181
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,279
{\fs19}为什么 McGee 你当时在哪里
Why, McGee, where were you?

182
00:07:27,348 --> 00:07:29,014
{\fs19}我那时在 那个 老兵援助中心
I was at the, uh, V.A. center,

183
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,150
{\fs19}整理我们受害者的私人物品
collecting our victim's personal effects.

184
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:34,453
{\fs19}没有明显的线索 但看情况我们也不需要了
No obvious leads, but sounds like we don't need them.

185
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:35,962
{\fs19}Bishop和Torres似乎很确定这个叫Vicious的
Bishop and Torres seem pretty certain

186
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,990
{\fs19}-是我们要找的凶手 -他们联系你了
this Vicious guy is our killer. - They called you?

187
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:39,425
{\fs19}不 他们 呃 在楼下大厅里
No, they're, uh, down in the lobby.

188
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:40,826
{\fs19}他们为什么不和你一起上来
Why didn't they come up with you?

189
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:43,596
{\fs19}他们在忙得手忙脚乱的
Well, they kind of have their hands full.

190
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,664
{\fs19}忙什么
Full with what?

191
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,136
{\fs19}啊 Gibbs 主任 嘿
Ah, Gibbs, Director, hey.

192
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:52,872
{\fs19}我们能解释的
We can explain.

193
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,340
{\fs19}儿童服务机构那里发生什么事了
What happened to Child Services?

194
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:56,509
{\fs19}嘘 他在睡觉
Shh. He's sleeping.

195
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:58,851
{\fs19}就是当我们堵在路上的时候我打他们的电话
So we were sitting in traffic and I called them,

196
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:02,047
{\fs19}大概打了五次但他们每次都让我等着 一次又一次的等着
like, five times and they put me on hold every time, like, over and over.

197
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:04,328
{\fs19}对 他们每年到这个时候应该都是忙得不可开交的
Yeah. They must must be really overwhelmed this time of year.

198
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:06,330
{\fs19}你懂的 所以考虑到这个以及特区的交通情况
You know, so between that and the traffic on the Beltway...

199
00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:09,021
{\fs19}对 所以我们想着 把孩子带到这里来
Yeah, so we figure, bring the baby over here.

200
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,991
{\fs19}我们找到孩子母亲的速度要比儿童服务机构快得多
We can find the mother way faster than Child Services.

201
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,660
{\fs19}当我们找到她的时候 我们就能了结Vicious的案子
And once we find her, we will have closed the case on Vicious,

202
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,328
{\fs19}然后我们就都能回家过圣诞了
and we can all go home for Christmas.

203
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:17,863
{\fs19}哦 听着还有些押韵
Oh, that kind of rhymes.

204
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:19,465
{\fs19}所以Bishop差点被杀
So Bishop nearly gets killed

205
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:21,000
{\fs19}而且他们俩都受什么刺激了
and they both went into shock?

206
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,835
{\fs19}不 那个 主任
No, uh, Director.

207
00:08:22,904 --> 00:08:24,837
{\fs19}这个办公室可不是婴儿呆的地方
This office is no place for a baby.

208
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:28,240
{\fs19}虽然这孩子是非常的可爱
Though he is pretty damn cute.

209
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,047
{\fs19}说得对 所以 我们没事了
Cool. So, uh, we're good?

210
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:36,482
{\fs19}不 我们可不是没事
No. We are not good.

211
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:37,983
{\fs19}我们的事还多着呢
We are not near good.

212
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:40,319
{\fs19}但我们到这步了
But here we are.

213
00:08:40,388 --> 00:08:42,421
{\fs19}这个孩子现在是你们的职责了
That baby is your responsibility.

214
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:45,991
{\fs19}McGee 你试试看能不能
McGee, see if you can unlock

215
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,393
{\fs19}解锁这个变态的手机
this creep's cell phone,

216
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:49,495
{\fs19}找找里面有没有孩子母亲的相关信息
and see if the mother's in there somewhere.

217
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:51,931
{\fs19}他的记录里面没有关于他的婚姻状态或者孩子的
Nothing in his records about marital status or kids.

218
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,766
{\fs19}你们两个 下楼去Kasie那里看看
You two, go down and check with Kasie.

219
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,601
{\fs19}她在查找我们发现的那把刀上的指纹
She's running prints off the knife we found.

220
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,770
{\fs19}让她同时也查一下这个孩子的DNA
Tell her to run the baby's DNA while she's at it.

221
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:00,506
{\fs19}-这就去办 老大 -呃 老大
- You got it, Gibbs. - Uh, boss,

222
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:03,042
{\fs19}有个人自称是Albert Leary的律师
someone claiming to be Albert Leary's attorney

223
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,344
{\fs19}-想见见他的委托人 -Vicious
wants to see his client. Vicious.

224
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,383
{\fs19}提取到我们的嫌犯的指纹了吗
Any prints from our suspect yet?

225
00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:13,252
{\fs19}我才刚打开他的裹尸袋
I'm only just unwrapping him now.

226
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:16,021
{\fs19}好吧 那么这位肯定是我们的受害人了
Okay. Well, then this must be our victim.

227
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,924
{\fs19}是的 一个无家可归的越战老兵
Yeah. He is a homeless vet.

228
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:21,427
{\fs19}很明显是庇护所里的真英雄
Apparently a real hero down at the shelter.

229
00:09:22,697 --> 00:09:24,964
{\fs19}嗯
Um...

230
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,298
{\fs19}Jerome Murray
Jerome Murray.

231
00:09:27,602 --> 00:09:29,535
{\fs19}哇
Wow.

232
00:09:29,604 --> 00:09:31,370
{\fs19}哇 什么
Wow, what?

233
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:33,372
{\fs19}你认识他吗
You know him?

234
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:35,808
{\fs19}只是 让我想起了某个人
Just, uh, reminded me of someone.

235
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,309
{\fs19}是吗 谁
Yeah? Who?

236
00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:38,777
{\fs19}哦 太好了
Oh, good.

237
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:40,446
{\fs19}Kasie你在这里
Kasie, you're here.

238
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:43,282
{\fs19}对 我在这儿 这是个婴儿吗
Oh. Here I am. Is that a baby?

239
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:45,884
{\fs19}呃 对的 对的 没错 他是不会进来的
Uh, yes. Yes, it is, and he is not coming in.

240
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,720
{\fs19}呃 孩子 就是说 这个人的孩子
Uh, baby, as in, like, this guy's baby?

241
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,455
{\fs19}我听说你在他的住处发现了一个
I heard you found one at his place.

242
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,090
{\fs19}呃 嘿 我们需要尽快获取他的DNA
Uh, hey. We need his DNA ASAP

243
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:52,703
{\fs19}以及你在刀上找到的任何指纹
and whatever prints you found on the knife.

244
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:54,560
{\fs19}哦 好的 没问题 为什么这么着急
Oh, yeah. No problem. What's the hurry?

245
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:56,161
{\fs19}急着过圣诞
The hurry is Christmas.

246
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,041
{\fs19}我们只需要找到这个孩子的妈妈
Well, we just need to find the baby's mother,

247
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:00,232
{\fs19}并且确定Vicious就是凶手
and confirm that Vicious was the killer,

248
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:02,334
{\fs19}最好是在我们明天离开之前
preferably before we leave tomorrow.

249
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:06,672
{\fs19}噢 他是最可爱的了 他叫什么名字
Oh, he is the cutest; what's his name?

250
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:08,407
{\fs19}我们没有问名字的机会
Well, we didn't get the chance to ask,

251
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:09,908
{\fs19}因为枪战等等
with the shooting and all.

252
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:11,143
{\fs19}也是 我听说了
Right. I heard about that.

253
00:10:11,212 --> 00:10:12,578
{\fs19}你没事我真是太高兴了
I'm so glad you're okay.

254
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:14,013
{\fs19}谢谢
Thanks.

255
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,581
{\fs19}你会给我血液样本和指纹的吧
You'll send me blood and prints?

256
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,182
{\fs19}我会尽快做的
Quick as I can.

257
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:22,988
{\fs19}我承认 Gibbs探员 我对这位要援助的客户
I admit, Agent Gibbs, to a rather reluctant soft spot

258
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:25,591
{\fs19}实在是放心不下 所以就来这里了
for my pro Bono clients, which is why I'm here.

259
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,026
{\fs19}啊 原来他联系的人是你
Ah, so you're the one he called.

260
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,827
{\fs19}对 而且自从我几个月前帮他得到了
Yes, and I hadn't seen nor spoken

261
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:31,463
{\fs19}辩诉交易之后我就没见见过或者跟他说过话
to Albert since getting him a plea deal months ago.

262
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:34,466
{\fs19}然后突然间这个手机响了还伴随着枪声
Then out of the blue this phone call and those gunshots.

263
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:37,136
{\fs19}我去了他的住处 当地警方让我到这里来
I went by his place and the local P.D. pointed me here.

264
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,204
{\fs19}那么我们能为你做些什么呢
Well, what can we do for you?

265
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:40,639
{\fs19}我看到血迹了
I saw the blood.

266
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,875
{\fs19}我能问问出了什么事吗 他还活着吗
May I ask what happened? Is he even alive?

267
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:46,045
{\fs19}他死了 他曾是一起凶杀案的嫌犯
No. He was a suspect in a murder investigation.

268
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,881
{\fs19}他不想回答问题
He would not answer questions.

269
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,116
{\fs19}先开了枪
He started shooting.

270
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:54,865
{\fs19}天哪 你想帮助这些人 但他们就是
Man, you try to help these people, and they just...

271
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,689
{\fs19}没救
won't be helped.

272
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:59,358
{\fs19}他曾提到过妻子或者女朋友之类的吗
He ever mention a wife, girlfriend?

273
00:10:59,427 --> 00:11:01,060
{\fs19}噢 这个我也没法说
Oh, couldn't tell you.

274
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:05,064
{\fs19}不管喜欢不喜欢 我坚守着正常的个人距离
Soft spot or not, I maintain a healthy personal distance.

275
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:08,300
{\fs19}我是说 据我所知 他有不少的妻子或者女友
I mean, for all I know, Albert had ten of each.

276
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:10,736
{\fs19}-我们说的这位应该是刚有了个孩子 -一个孩子
- This one would have just had a baby. - A baby?

277
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:12,504
{\fs19}噢 天哪 不是吧
Oh, man. Come on.

278
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:16,341
{\fs19}还是那句话 让我说 他有十个孩子也不奇怪
Again... for all I know, he had ten of those, too.

279
00:11:17,645 --> 00:11:18,811
{\fs19}没错
Right.

280
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,213
{\fs19}好吧 为你的客户感到遗憾
Okay. Sorry about your client.

281
00:11:21,282 --> 00:11:22,214
{\fs19}谢谢
Thank you.

282
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:23,816
{\fs19}哦 忽然想起来
Oh, come to think of it,

283
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:26,218
{\fs19}Albert说他是从弗罗里达来的
Albert said that he was from Florida.

284
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:28,387
{\fs19}可能在那边会有个女朋友
Might be a girlfriend down there.

285
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,890
{\fs19}这就对了 兄弟
There you go, buddy.

286
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,525
{\fs19}真是好孩子 Nicholas
Good boy, Nicholas.

287
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:35,994
{\fs19}Nicholas
Nicholas?

288
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,171
{\fs19}对 我们不妨给他起个名字吧
Yeah, we might as well give him a name.

289
00:11:38,195 --> 00:11:38,998
{\fs19}呣
Hmm.

290
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,166
{\fs19}所以你用你的名字给他起名
So you name him after yourself?

291
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:42,601
{\fs19}不是 就像 NCIS
No, the... it's, like, NCIS.

292
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,436
{\fs19}你懂的 你挪动一下字母的位置
You know, you move some letters around,

293
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:47,873
{\fs19}-再随便加点 -嗯 你说是就是吧
you toss in a few. - Mm, yeah, right, mm-hmm.

294
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,610
{\fs19}要我说他更适合叫
I'd say he's more of a...

295
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,413
{\fs19}Logan或者Cody
Logan or Cody.

296
00:11:54,482 --> 00:11:57,082
{\fs19}这名字简直是不能更加的白人化了
Those are, like, the whitest names ever.

297
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:58,383
{\fs19}真不给面子
Rude.

298
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,753
{\fs19}不管他叫什么名字吧
Well, whatever his name is,

299
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,921
{\fs19}他都很惹人喜欢
he is adorable.

300
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,757
{\fs19}他太可爱了 不是吗 McGee
Isn't he cute, McGee?

301
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,525
{\fs19}所有的宝宝都很可爱
All babies are cute.

302
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:08,761
{\fs19}嘴上这么说你都不肯看他一眼
Yet you won't even look at him.

303
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:11,764
{\fs19}是的 那是因为如果我直视他的眼睛 我就和他建立了关系
Yes. That's because if we make eye contact, I will bond,

304
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:14,066
{\fs19}如果我和他建立了关系 我就不能专心处理案子
and if I bond, I'll get distracted from this case,

305
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:16,146
{\fs19}反过来就会影响我回家过圣诞
which in turn could prevent me from spending Christmas

306
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,971
{\fs19}和我自己的两个小宝贝团聚 所以我们还是找到他的妈妈吧
with my own two little cuties, so let's just find his mother.

307
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,039
{\fs19}是啊 你说得对 我们分心了
Okay, you're right. We got distracted.

308
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,075
{\fs19}而且你看 他现在睡着了
And, look, he's all asleep now,

309
00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:25,878
{\fs19}所以 我们可以搞定一些工作了
so... we'll be able to get some work done.

310
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,613
{\fs19}小心点 婴儿们很容易醒来的
Careful. Babies do wake up.

311
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:29,214
{\fs19}McGee 别担心
McGee, don't worry.

312
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:30,816
{\fs19}我们能搞定的
We got this.

313
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:32,251
{\fs19}好吧
Okay.

314
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:35,854
{\fs19}哇哦
Whoa.

315
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,857
{\fs19}Nicholas 宝宝 怎么了
Nicholas, buddy, what happened?

316
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,626
{\fs19}你又一次咒了我们
You jinxed us. Again.

317
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:44,596
{\fs19}好了 你们谁发布个通缉令
All right, somebody put a BOLO out.

318
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:46,365
{\fs19}-通缉谁 -一个在这孩子的尿布里
- On who? - On the 300-pound biker

319
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,267
{\fs19}拉了一大坨的300磅的自行车手
who dropped a log in this kid's diaper.

320
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,002
{\fs19}噢 我的天哪
Oh, my God.

321
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,205
{\fs19}-哦 不 -不用担心
- Oh, no. - No worries.

322
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:54,807
{\fs19}我们早有准备
We are prepared.

323
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,141
{\fs19}看这里 看这里
Here, here.

324
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,609
{\fs19}噢 我们有
Oh... We got, um...

325
00:12:57,678 --> 00:12:58,844
{\fs19}我们买了很多
we bought plenty.

326
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:01,647
{\fs19}哦 不 不 这些是让幼童用的
Oh, no. No, these are for toddlers.

327
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:03,115
{\fs19}对他来说太大了
These are way too big for him.

328
00:13:03,184 --> 00:13:04,216
{\fs19}嘿 那个 McGee
Hey, uh, McGee?

329
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:05,350
{\fs19}那么 我是说
So, like...

330
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:07,019
{\fs19}我们该怎么办
what do we do?

331
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,821
{\fs19}你什么意思 你说你能搞定的
What do you mean? You got this.

332
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,691
{\fs19}找Jimmy去
Jimmy.

333
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,899
{\fs19}啊 别闹了吧 兄弟
Ah, come on, buddy.

334
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,068
{\fs19}很高兴知道了我还没失去手感
It's nice to know I haven't lost my touch.

335
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:26,004
{\fs19}布尿布比一次性尿布好得多
Yeah, cloth diapers are so much better than disposable,

336
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:28,807
{\fs19}对环境和婴儿都好
both for the environment and for the baby.

337
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:30,309
{\fs19}-让我来 -什么 不行
- Here, let me get that. - What? No.

338
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,844
{\fs19}你不能用订书机
You can't use a stapler.

339
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,679
{\fs19}用安全别针 连我都知道这个
Safety pins. Even I know that.

340
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,881
{\fs19}由于我们没有安全别针
Seeing as we don't have any safety pins,

341
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,382
{\fs19}这些小长尾夹
these little binder clips

342
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:40,352
{\fs19}应该可以解决问题
should do the trick.

343
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:42,799
{\fs19}Palmer 你在做什么 你会夹到他的 你夹到他了
Palmer, what are you doing? You're gonna pinch him. You're pinching him.

344
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,627
{\fs19}没事的 他可能只是饿了
No, it's okay. He's probably just hungry.

345
00:13:44,628 --> 00:13:47,359
{\fs19}这儿 我有他喝的奶
Oh, here, I have his formula.

346
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:48,927
{\fs19}不行 那个牌子不行
Oh, no, not that brand.

347
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:52,664
{\fs19}里面全防腐剂 玉米糖浆
No. That's filled with, uh, preservatives, corn syrup...

348
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:55,534
{\fs19}是啊 把它放回去 来点苹果汁怎么样
Yeah. Put that back. Maybe some apple juice.

349
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:58,036
{\fs19}那更糟糕 你顺便再给他倒杯啤酒吧
That's even worse. You might as well pour him a beer.

350
00:13:58,105 --> 00:13:59,571
{\fs19}-哼 -要知道的东西太多了 
- Hmm. - There's so much to know.

351
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,173
{\fs19}是啊 太多东西我们都不知道
Yeah. So much we don't know.

352
00:14:01,242 --> 00:14:02,841
{\fs19}你们才刚接触
You guys are new to this.

353
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,077
{\fs19}感觉不中用是所有新手父母的
It's like a rite of passage for all new parents

354
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:07,613
{\fs19}必经之路r
to feel inadequate.

355
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:11,250
{\fs19}哦 来了
Oh, there we go.

356
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,951
{\fs19}嗨
Hi.

357
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,953
{\fs19}-其他人在哪里 -在Jimmy那里
- Where is everybody? - With Jimmy.

358
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,723
{\fs19}显然 现在是三个人在换尿布
Apparently, changing a diaper is now a three-person job.

359
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,024
{\fs19}很好 有什么进展吗
Swell. Update.

360
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:20,959
{\fs19}手机没有什么发现
Well, no help on the cell phone.

361
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,428
{\fs19}除了给律师打电话 Vicious只打给过几个
Other than calling his attorney, Vicious used it exclusively

362
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:24,763
{\fs19}一次性号码
to call burn phones.

363
00:14:24,832 --> 00:14:27,065
{\fs19}没有发现他妻子或者女朋友的线索
No wife or girlfriend to be found.

364
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:28,767
{\fs19}再查查这些号码
Recheck the numbers.

365
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:31,370
{\fs19}看是否有佛罗里达地区的号码
See if any have a Florida area code.

366
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:37,109
{\fs19}Boss 虽然讨厌这样子 但我还得说我不能错过
Boss, I hate to say this, but I really can't miss

367
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,144
{\fs19}明天早上去芝加哥的航班
my flight to Chicago in the morning.

368
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:40,712
{\fs19}McGee 不会错过的
No one's missing anything, McGee.

369
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:42,748
{\fs19}只要我们确定了凶手 你就可以走了
Once we confirm the killer, you go,

370
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:43,751
{\fs19}不论有没有找到孩子的母亲
whether we find the mother or not.

371
00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:44,984
{\fs19}谢谢
Thank you.

372
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:47,386
{\fs19}应该要不了太久 这看上去已经很清楚了
It shouldn't take too long. Seems pretty open-and-shut.

373
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,655
{\fs19}这不是看上去清楚 Tim
Oh, it doesn't seem open-and-shut, Tim.

374
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,890
{\fs19}是绝对清楚
It most definitely is.

375
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,125
{\fs19}-指纹对上了吗 -还有血迹
Fingerprints? And blood.

376
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:54,726
{\fs19}后面的是Jerome的
The latter being Jerome's,

377
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:57,396
{\fs19}前面的与Vicious符合 就是我们的凶手
and the former matching Vicious, our killer.

378
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:59,164
{\fs19}对这两个人来说 这可不是个愉快的结局
Well, not a happy ending for either party,

379
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,600
{\fs19}但至少这破案速度是我们期待的
but at least it's the quick case we were hoping for.

380
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:02,669
{\fs19}Kase 拿到DNA了吗
Kase, you get DNA?

381
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,236
{\fs19}DNA不符合
DNA came back negative.

382
00:15:04,305 --> 00:15:06,605
{\fs19}-什么 -Albert 外号Vicious
- What? - Albert aka Vicious

383
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:08,573
{\fs19}肯定
is most definitely

384
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,275
{\fs19}不是孩子的亲生父亲
not the baby's father,

385
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:13,445
{\fs19}我们得找这孩子的父亲与母亲了
making us oh-for-two on parents right now.

386
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:16,481
{\fs19}好了
All right,

387
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,151
{\fs19}这个小孩 完好如初
here's the little man, good as new.

388
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,286
{\fs19}这可不是你的功劳 McGee
Yeah, no thanks to you, McGee.

389
00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:27,993
{\fs19}大家怎么都不笑
Uh-oh. Nobody's smiling.

390
00:15:29,063 --> 00:15:30,762
{\fs19}怎么了
What's wrong?

391
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:32,864
{\fs19}这是个偷来的婴儿
We're looking at a stolen baby.

392
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,501
{\fs19}我们怎么会没有收到任何消息
Hey, wouldn't we have heard something?

393
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,269
{\fs19}这肯定会有安珀警报
【Amber Alert：发生儿童绑架案时，透过各种媒体向社会大众传播】
There had to be an Amber Alert.

394
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:47,937
{\fs19}这周发出过三个警报 主任
Make that three alerts, Director,

395
00:15:48,006 --> 00:15:49,606
{\fs19}就在东北部
just in the Northeast this week.

396
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:51,808
{\fs19}但没有新生儿
But none for a newborn.

397
00:15:51,877 --> 00:15:54,277
{\fs19}我简直无法相信失踪孩子的统计数据
I just can't believe the statistics on missing kids.

398
00:15:54,346 --> 00:15:56,513
{\fs19}我是说 小孩子从医院 停车场
I mean, they're stolen from hospitals, parking lots,

399
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,114
{\fs19}自己家里被偷走
people's own homes.

400
00:15:58,183 --> 00:16:00,116
{\fs19}重新再查下每件案子
Double-check every case.

401
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:02,152
{\fs19}从本地开始 向外排查
Start locally, work outward.

402
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,621
{\fs19}我找到市中心区的两桩案子
I've got two cases here in the Metro area,

403
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,590
{\fs19}但都不符合这个孩子的年龄和外貌
but neither matches our baby's age or description.

404
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:09,426
{\fs19}什么样的恶人居然会偷孩子
What kind of monster would steal a baby?

405
00:16:09,494 --> 00:16:12,662
{\fs19}已经躺在解剖台上的恶人
The kind dead on Palmer's table.

406
00:16:12,731 --> 00:16:15,098
{\fs19}不论你在生活中有多么卑微堕落
Whatever lowly, depraved person you were in life,

407
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,866
{\fs19}你死了也是有机会的
here's your chance in death.

408
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,868
{\fs19}你在哪里偷来了这个孩子
Where did you get that baby?

409
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,870
{\fs19}你真的在等他回答吗
Are you really expecting an answer?

410
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,139
{\fs19}也许来自来世
From beyond, maybe.

411
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,008
{\fs19}通灵消息
A psychic message.

412
00:16:25,077 --> 00:16:27,377
{\fs19}现在 我会收集我能得到的信息
At this point, I will take what I can get.

413
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:29,546
{\fs19}我想和Jerome说说话
I need a word with my buddy Jerome.

414
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,492
{\fs19}你说过他让你想起了某个人
Yeah, you mentioned that he reminded you of someone?

415
00:16:31,516 --> 00:16:32,882
{\fs19}也不算是
Oh, yeah. Not really, though.

416
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,385
{\fs19}但你有没有碰巧在他衣服里找到过什么
But did you happen to find anything in his clothes?

417
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:38,154
{\fs19}有没有什么东西掉出来
Anything that might have fallen out, maybe?

418
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:39,556
{\fs19}比如
Anything like...?

419
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,991
{\fs19}紫心勋章 这个盒子在他的行李箱里
Purple Heart. This box was in his duffel

420
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,660
{\fs19}但里面没有勋章
with no medal inside.

421
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:45,795
{\fs19}没有 我没找到那样的东西
Wow. No, I didn't find anything like that.

422
00:16:45,864 --> 00:16:47,341
{\fs19}这让我查了他的服役记录
Got me looking into his service record,

423
00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:48,865
{\fs19}结果发现他去了中东不止一次
and turns out he did not one,

424
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:50,800
{\fs19}而是三次
but three tours in the Middle East.

425
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:53,303
{\fs19}在一次差点杀了他的爆炸后 他得到了紫心勋章
Purple Heart came after an IED nearly killed him.

426
00:16:53,371 --> 00:16:55,572
{\fs19}那些旧手术伤疤就说得通了
That would explain all the old surgical scars.

427
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,042
{\fs19}他退伍后 一直在与创伤后应激障碍
After he was discharged, he battled PTSD

428
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:01,678
{\fs19}和止疼药成瘾作斗争
and a painkiller addiction for years.

429
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:04,547
{\fs19}退伍军人管理局试着给他提供帮助  但他没有家人
V.A. tried to provide support, but with no living family,

430
00:17:04,616 --> 00:17:07,217
{\fs19}他在07年的时候完全掉线了
he fell off the grid entirely in '07.

431
00:17:07,285 --> 00:17:09,052
{\fs19}-掉线了 -哦 无家可归
- Off the grid? - Oh, homelessness.

432
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:10,253
{\fs19}不奇怪的故事了
An all-too-common tale.

433
00:17:10,277 --> 00:17:12,421
{\fs19}这些人数非常惊人
Yeah, the numbers are pretty staggering.

434
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,257
{\fs19}你认为勋章在
You think the medal might have fallen out

435
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:15,470
{\fs19}McGee在装袋他行李箱的时候掉了吗
when McGee was packing the duffel?

436
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:17,260
{\fs19}或者Jeome
You know, that or maybe Jerome

437
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,696
{\fs19}之前把它当了换钱
just pawned it for cash at some point.

438
00:17:19,765 --> 00:17:21,498
{\fs19}但他留着盒子
Yeah. But he kept the box.

439
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:23,900
{\fs19}很明显 这对他有重要的意义
So clearly, it meant something to him.

440
00:17:23,969 --> 00:17:25,869
{\fs19}他应当戴着它下葬
He should be buried with it.

441
00:17:25,937 --> 00:17:29,272
{\fs19}这个点给退伍军人管理局打电话太晚了
Too late to hit the V.A. center.

442
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:31,385
{\fs19}我们明天直接过去
Yeah, we'll just have to go over there in the morning.

443
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:34,077
{\fs19}我们吗 明天是平安夜
Uh, "we"? Tomorrow is Christmas Eve.

444
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:37,113
{\fs19}好的 那么我们早点去那里
Okay, so we'll go over there early.

445
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:39,282
{\fs19}勋章明显对Jerome意义重大
Well, the medal obviously meant something to Jerome,

446
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:40,917
{\fs19}也就是说对你也有帮助 那么
which means something to you, so...

447
00:17:40,986 --> 00:17:43,086
{\fs19}为什么我们不一起去呢
why not "we"?

448
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,768
{\fs19}把毯子裹上
All right, you bring the blanket around,

449
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:48,091
{\fs19}裹得紧些
keep it nice and tight,

450
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,360
{\fs19}好了 温暖又舒适
and there you go, snug as a bug.

451
00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:52,362
{\fs19}像个玉米卷饼
He's like a little baby burrito.

452
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,863
{\fs19}我喜欢玉米卷饼
I like burritos.

453
00:17:53,932 --> 00:17:54,932
{\fs19}看看他感觉多么安全
Look how secure he looks.

454
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,611
{\fs19}像是回到了子宫内 去吧
Like he's back in the womb. There you go, buddy.

455
00:17:56,635 --> 00:17:58,601
{\fs19}嘿 你还不走吗
Hey. Don't you got to get going?

456
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,537
{\fs19}头儿 要赶最早的航班
Uh, yeah, boss. Got an early flight

457
00:18:00,605 --> 00:18:02,972
{\fs19}还得打包
to catch-- still got to pack.

458
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,942
{\fs19}但我知道你会先找到他的母亲
But, uh, I know you'll find the mother before then, so...

459
00:18:06,011 --> 00:18:07,977
{\fs19}去吧 McGee 代我向你家人问好
Go, McGee. Say hi to your family.

460
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,046
{\fs19}-圣诞快乐 -圣诞快乐 头儿
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, boss.

461
00:18:10,115 --> 00:18:11,047
{\fs19}大家节日快乐
Happy holidays, guys.

462
00:18:11,116 --> 00:18:12,048
{\fs19}-再见 -McGee再见
See ya. Bye, McGee.

463
00:18:12,117 --> 00:18:13,117
{\fs19}你呢
What about you?

464
00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:14,162
{\fs19}你的航班几点
What time's your plane leave?

465
00:18:14,186 --> 00:18:15,496
{\fs19}任何时候都行 我可以订个晚点的
Uh, whenever. I can book a later one.

466
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,654
{\fs19}我还是认为
You know, I still think

467
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,956
{\fs19}儿童服务机构是最适合他的地方
Child Services is the best place for him.

468
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:21,457
{\fs19}我们
Ooh, and we

469
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:22,992
{\fs19}并不太同意
respectfully disagree.

470
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,839
{\fs19}他们会把他送到哪里去
"I mean, where are they gonna put him, anyway?

471
00:18:24,863 --> 00:18:26,162
{\fs19}他已经经历了这么多事
He's already been through so much

472
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,630
{\fs19}被某个陌生人偷走
to be handed off to some stranger.

473
00:18:27,699 --> 00:18:29,499
{\fs19}小Nicky要待的地方就在这里
Little Nicky's place is right here.

474
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:31,501
{\fs19}现在他是小Nicky了吗
Oh. Now he's Little Nicky?

475
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,102
{\fs19}行了 我明白了
Okay, I get it, but...

476
00:18:33,171 --> 00:18:34,571
{\fs19}但他不能呆在这里
he can't stay here.

477
00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:36,840
{\fs19}你们谁把他带回家
Which one of you gonna take him home?

478
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:40,243
{\fs19}你家不怎么适合小孩子
Well, your place isn't exactly, uh, baby-friendly.

479
00:18:40,312 --> 00:18:42,478
{\fs19}你家那里没有日托所
And your place is no day care center.

480
00:18:42,547 --> 00:18:44,180
{\fs19}你们两个都不知道
And neither one of you

481
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,349
{\fs19}怎么照顾小孩子
know how to take care of a baby.

482
00:18:51,156 --> 00:18:52,255
{\fs19}不行
Nope.

483
00:18:52,324 --> 00:18:53,523
{\fs19}不可能
No.

484
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,658
{\fs19}不可能
Not gonna happen. N...

485
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:57,694
{\fs19}我不会这么做的
I'm not doing it.

486
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,598
{\fs19}不行
No.

487
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,600
{\fs19}对 就像这样
Yeah, this is more like it.

488
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:06,302
{\fs19}不 应该是你来生火
No. More like it would be you tending the fire

489
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:08,171
{\fs19}我看着孩子
and me holding the baby.

490
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,141
{\fs19}你什么时候在乎起了刻板的性别角色
And since when do you care about stereotypical gender roles?

491
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:16,846
{\fs19}哇
Whoa.

492
00:19:16,915 --> 00:19:19,482
{\fs19}提醒我要清理阁楼了
Whew. Remind me to clean out the attic.

493
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:24,954
{\fs19}你还留着这个
You still have this.

494
00:19:25,023 --> 00:19:26,556
{\fs19}把能留的都留着
Got to hold on to what you can.

495
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,892
{\fs19}把这个装在
You know, it might be a better idea to set this up

496
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,004
{\fs19}楼上的空房间可能会更好
in the spare bedroom upstairs.

497
00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:31,194
{\fs19}我们也这么考虑过
Uh, we were also thinking that

498
00:19:31,263 --> 00:19:33,196
{\fs19}也许 楼下会
maybe, uh, down here could be

499
00:19:33,265 --> 00:19:34,731
{\fs19}更加舒服 另外
a little bit more cozy, plus...

500
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,470
{\fs19}我们三个可以轮流照顾他
you know, the three of us can take shifts.

501
00:19:36,546 --> 00:19:38,102
{\fs19}轮流
Shifts?

502
00:19:38,103 --> 00:19:40,403
{\fs19}就是 每隔几小时换一次人
Yeah. Like... you know, like, every few hours.

503
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:41,537
{\fs19}是啊
Yeah.

504
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,805
{\fs19}不行
No.

505
00:19:42,874 --> 00:19:44,173
{\fs19}我不来
No shift for me.

506
00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:45,909
{\fs19}我去地下室待着
No, I'll be in the basement.

507
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,510
{\fs19}晚安
Night.

508
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,850
{\fs19}-怎么 -什么
- What? - Huh?

509
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,590
{\fs19}你刚叹了口气
You sighed.

510
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,760
{\fs19}我没叹气
I didn't sigh.

511
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,930
{\fs19}好吧 我叹气了
Okay, I sighed.

512
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,190
{\fs19}我刚才只是在想Gibbs说过的
I was just thinking about what Gibbs said

513
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,100
{\fs19}珍惜你所拥有的一切
about hanging on to what you can.

514
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,830
{\fs19}你说的是这个婴儿车吗
Talking about the bassinet?

515
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,900
{\fs19}这是他女儿的婴儿车
His daughter's bassinet.

516
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,670
{\fs19}嗯
Mm...

517
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,840
{\fs19}他的圣诞装饰
his ornaments.

518
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,410
{\fs19}你知道 Shannon和Kelly
You know, Shannon and Kelly,

519
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,740
{\fs19}她们已经离开好多年了 但是
they've been gone for so many years, but...

520
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,670
{\fs19}给  
爸爸
爱你的
Kelly
她们已经离开好多年了 但是
they've been gone for so many years, but...

521
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:22,740
{\fs19}给  
爸爸
爱你的
Kelly

522
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,740
{\fs19}他一直在树上留着她们的卡片
he keeps them right there up on the tree.
给  
爸爸
爱你的
Kelly

523
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,380
{\fs19}他一直在树上留着她们的卡片
he keeps them right there up on the tree.

524
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,910
{\fs19}永远就是永远
Forever means forever.

525
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,880
{\fs19}我今天差点死掉 Nick
I almost died today, Nick.

526
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,190
{\fs19}我尽量不去想这事儿
I'm trying not to think about it.

527
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,190
{\fs19}我也是
Yeah, you and me both.

528
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,060
{\fs19}那个宝宝
And that baby...

529
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,560
{\fs19}让我很容易忘记这件事
made it a lot easier.

530
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,230
{\fs19}但是那件事让人不得不
But it can't help but make a person

531
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,530
{\fs19}重新审视很多事情 你知道吗
reassess things, you know?

532
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,200
{\fs19}比如
Things like...?

533
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,800
{\fs19}比如你刚说的
Like what you just said.

534
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,740
{\fs19}永远
Forever.

535
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:57,140
{\fs19}我们坚持什么 我们留下什么
What we hold on to, what we leave behind.

536
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,740
{\fs19}-然后呢 -然后
- And? - And...

537
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,280
{\fs19}我不知道
I don't know.

538
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,080
{\fs19}我一直觉得某一天我会当一个妈妈
I always thought I'd be a mom someday,

539
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,950
{\fs19}但是 我从没真正想象过我自己
but... I never really pictured myself,

540
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,720
{\fs19}做妈妈是什么样子
like, mothering, you know?

541
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,920
{\fs19}嗯
Hmm.

542
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,290
{\fs19}经历过今天这些事 我感觉自己已经完全准备好应对任何事了
Well, after today, I feel pretty much prepared for anything.

543
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,330
{\fs19}唉
Ay.

544
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,930
{\fs19}真是时候
Right on cue.

545
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,570
{\fs19}我从没见过任何奖章
You know, I never saw any medals.

546
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,110
{\fs19}也许昨天来这里的那个不错的探员
But maybe that nice agent who was here yesterday,

547
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,670
{\fs19}把它们都丢掉了
maybe he dropped them.

548
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,480
{\fs19}你们也许想仔细看看Jerome的床
You might want to look around Jerome's bed.

549
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,110
{\fs19}非常感谢 我们不会耽误很长时间
Thanks so much. We shouldn't be long.

550
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,910
{\fs19}我得说 我一直很难找到他的近亲
I must say, I've been having some challenges

551
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,850
{\fs19}来告知他的
just trying to find his next of kin

552
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,520
{\fs19}-死讯 -Jerome没有近亲
- to notify. - Jerome didn't have any.

553
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,950
{\fs19}他的双亲在他入伍前就去世了
Parents died before he was enlisted

554
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,290
{\fs19}记录上也没有兄弟姐妹和表亲
and no siblings or cousins on record.

555
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,670
{\fs19}-你们给我省了不少麻烦 -但是如果你们需要招人
- You saved me some trouble. - But if you need a point person

556
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,760
{\fs19}-去参加葬礼 我很乐意... -呃不 不 不
- for funeral plans, I'm here... - Uh, no, no, no.

557
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,960
{\fs19}退伍军人事务部会处理好一切的
No, no, the V.A. will handle everything.

558
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,730
{\fs19}圣诞节一过 他们就会过来
They'll come and pick up Jerome's body

559
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,130
{\fs19}带走Jerome的遗体
right after Christmas.

560
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
{\fs19}啊 抱歉
Ah. Excuse me.

561
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:04,140
{\fs19}你能提出去葬礼真是太贴心了
Well, that was certainly nice of you to offer.

562
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,810
{\fs19}这个人没有亲人
Man's got no one else.

563
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,210
{\fs19}我永远无法理解
I'll never understand how a guy

564
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,610
{\fs19}一个像Jerome这样的人会沦落到无家可归
like Jerome could end up homeless.

565
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,110
{\fs19}要知道 有些年轻人应征入伍
You know, some young people enlist

566
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,380
{\fs19}是为了逃避糟糕的家庭生活或者邻居
to escape a bad homelife or neighborhood.

567
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,290
{\fs19}他们在那里有组织 有纪律
They get some structure, some discipline,

568
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,060
{\fs19}只是在退役之后又要回到
only to be discharged and come back to

569
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,720
{\fs19}无组织无纪律的生活中
none of those things.

570
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,460
{\fs19}依然糟糕的家庭生活 一样绝望的前景
Same bad homelife, same low prospects.

571
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,230
{\fs19}只不过对于他们中的某些人而言
Only for some of them, it's compounded

572
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,200
{\fs19}战斗造成的心理和生理创伤更加复杂
by the emotional and physical wounds of combat.

573
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,900
{\fs19}你对这事非常了解啊
You sure know a lot about this subject.

574
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,040
{\fs19}我 呃 我父亲比较了解
My, uh... my dad did.

575
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,640
{\fs19}等等 他曾经无家可归过吗
Wait. Was he ever homeless?

576
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,710
{\fs19}不 但他总说自己本可能无家可归
No, but he always said he could have been.

577
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,880
{\fs19}服役之后挣扎生活
Struggled himself after serving.

578
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,180
{\fs19}然后他在邮局找了一份工作并组建了一个家庭
Then he got a job with the post office and started a family.

579
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,350
{\fs19}但他经常为无家可归的老兵们提供咨询
But he counseled homeless veterans on the side.

580
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,650
{\fs19}他会说 他是在帮他们站起来
He was helping 'em get a leg up, he'd say.

581
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,690
{\fs19}所以这才是我们来这里的真正原因
So that's why we're here.

582
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,690
{\fs19}这正是你父亲会做的事
This is something your dad would have done.

583
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,930
{\fs19}也许吧
Maybe.

584
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,230
{\fs19}我听到的是真的吗
Is it true what I just heard?

585
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,700
{\fs19}是Vicious杀害了Jerome吗
Vicious killed Jerome?

586
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,400
{\fs19}看起来是这样的 没错
It appears to be the case, yeah.

587
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,110
{\fs19}所以Jerome确实那么做了
So Jerome did it.

588
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,510
{\fs19}他去向警察告发Vicious了
He went and ratted Vicious out to the cops.

589
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,410
{\fs19}呃 告发他
Uh, ratted him out?

590
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,880
{\fs19}Jerome当时正为自己没有立即阻止他而自责
Jerome was kicking himself for not stopping it right away.

591
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,350
{\fs19}-阻止什么 -阻止Vicious正在做的事
- Stopping what? - Whatever he saw Vicious do.

592
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,950
{\fs19}他不肯说是什么事 但是Jerome就在这个房间里告诉我
He wouldn't say what, but Jerome told me right here in this room

593
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,750
{\fs19}他打算去跟警察说这件事
he planned to go to the cops about it.

594
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,120
{\fs19}现在他死了
And now he's dead.

595
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,690
{\fs19}等等 等等
Wait, wait.

596
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
{\fs19}不管Jerome看到了什么
Whatever Jerome saw,

597
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,090
{\fs19}他有没有碰巧提过是什么时候在哪里发生的
did he happen to say where and when?

598
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,430
{\fs19}♪ Dashing through the snow ♪

599
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,130
{\fs19}♪ In a one-horse open sleigh ♪

600
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,600
{\fs19}♪ Over the fields we go... ♪

601
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,240
{\fs19}Jack
Jack?

602
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,540
{\fs19}嗨 怎么不去佛蒙特州滑雪了
Hey, what about skiing in Vermont?

603
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,640
{\fs19}哦 我今早犯了个错误
Oh, I made the mistake of checking in

604
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,980
{\fs19}出发前跟Vance打了个招呼
with Vance before leaving this morning.

605
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,730
{\fs19}他提了一下被偷走的宝宝
One mention of a stolen baby,

606
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,930
{\fs19}我觉得你们可能会比较缺人手 所以
and I thought you guys might be a little shorthanded, so...

607
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,320
{\fs19}嗨 Palmer 你有什么发现
Hey. Yeah, Palmer, what do you got?

608
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:58,590
{\fs19}所以你大老远回来是为了帮我们破案子还是看孩子
So you came all the way back for, uh, the case or the baby?

609
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,090
{\fs19}哦 得了 谁不爱孩子
Aw, come on. Who doesn't love a baby?

610
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,230
{\fs19}我尤其喜欢
I especially love a baby

611
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,600
{\fs19}让孩子待在安全幸福的家里
in a safe and happy home.

612
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,930
{\fs19}我们在这一点上没有任何进展
Yeah, which we're still no closer to finding.

613
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,330
{\fs19}Palmer发现了目击证人
Palmer found a witness.

614
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,900
{\fs19}我们需要看看安南代尔城
We need to dig up security footage

615
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,470
{\fs19}一个夜间商店的监控录像
from an all-night store in Annandale.

616
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,720
{\fs19}我们要找什么
What are we digging for?

617
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,840
{\fs19}任何跟Vicious和
Anything we can find

618
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,970
{\fs19}我们的受害人有关的事情
on Vicious or our victim.

619
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,220
{\fs19}嗨 伙计们
Hey, guys.

620
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,950
{\fs19}McGee
McGee?

621
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,720
{\fs19}一点也睡不着 所以 呃 订了个晚一点的航班
Couldn't sleep a wink, so, uh, booked a later flight.

622
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,480
{\fs19}发生了什么 我以为你应该在福蒙特州了
What happened? I thought you were supposed to be in Vermont.

623
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,190
{\fs19}哦
Oh.

624
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,760
{\fs19}有什么发现吗 Tim
Any luck, Tim?

625
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,830
{\fs19}花了些功夫 不过很幸运 安南代尔城
Well, took some doing, but fortunately, there is only one

626
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,530
{\fs19}只有一个便捷超市 你说要看停车场是吗 老大
Atlantic E-Z Mart in Annandale. You said the parking lot, boss?

627
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,350
{\fs19}是Palmer说的 大概凌晨3点左右
That's what Palmer said. Around 3:00 in the morning.

628
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,770
{\fs19}很难知道我们要看什么
Hard to know what we're looking for exactly.

629
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,350
{\fs19}放慢
Slow it down.

630
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,520
{\fs19}那是谁
Who's that?

631
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,680
{\fs19}我们认识她吗
Do we know her?

632
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,520
{\fs19}暂时不认识
Nope, not yet.

633
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,530
{\fs19}那就是我们要找的人
Well, that's our guy right there.

634
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,500
{\fs19}那是Vicious
That is Vicious.

635
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
{\fs19}他正在拿走宝宝
He's taking the baby.

636
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,470
{\fs19}我感觉好恶心
I'm gonna be sick.

637
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,500
{\fs19}Jerome来了
Here comes Jerome.

638
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,500
{\fs19}等等 她在干什么
Wait. What is she doing?

639
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,540
{\fs19}他给了她一个婴儿车
He's giving her an envelope.

640
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,410
{\fs19}然后她 她就让他把婴儿手推车推走了
And she's... she's letting him take the stroller.

641
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,880
{\fs19}哦 天呐 那个宝宝不是被偷走的
Oh, my God, that baby wasn't stolen.

642
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,350
{\fs19}老大 那一定是钱了
Boss, that's got to be money.

643
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,920
{\fs19}他是被卖掉的
He was sold.

644
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,550
{\fs19}我无法想象那个女孩经历了什么
I cannot imagine what this girl's been through

645
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,880
{\fs19}以至于要卖掉自己的孩子
to want to sell her baby.

646
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,350
{\fs19}你有什么发现吗
You got anything?

647
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,220
{\fs19}呃 婴儿车上唯一的指纹
Uh, the only prints on this stroller belong

648
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,890
{\fs19}属于Bishop和Torres DNA也没有匹配结果
to Bishop and Torres, and no hits on DNA, either.

649
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,820
{\fs19}面部识别呢
Facial recognition?

650
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:57,060
{\fs19}暂时还没结果
No matches yet.

651
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,530
{\fs19}-那是什么 -哦 那没什么
- What's that about? - Oh, that? That's nothing.

652
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,730
{\fs19}那不是没什么 她是想
It's not nothing. She's trying

653
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,770
{\fs19}给Jerome找一个紫心勋章 Gibbs探员
to find a Purple Heart, Agent Gibbs, for Jerome.

654
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,200
{\fs19}你可以花大概50块
You can buy one online for,

655
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,400
{\fs19}从网上买一个
like, 50 bucks,

656
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,400
{\fs19}但是过年期间的物流要花好几个星期才能到
but delivery this time of year takes weeks.

657
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,670
{\fs19}为什么Jerome会需要一个紫心勋章
Why does Jerome need a Purple Heart?

658
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,280
{\fs19}因为他得过一个 然后弄丢了
Because he earned it, and lost it.

659
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,250
{\fs19}是啊 好
Yeah. Yeah.

660

{\fs19}你真是个可爱的小伙子
You're such a sweet boy.

663
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,530
{\fs19}你的滑雪之旅就这么泡汤了
Well, so much for your ski trip.

664
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,460
{\fs19}McGee 芝加哥之旅什么情况
And McGee, what about Chicago?

665
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,800
{\fs19}我们能说什么呢 Leon
What can we say, Leon?

666
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,390
{\fs19}我们跟你过来的原因是一样的
We're here for the same reason you are.

667
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,870
{\fs19}不太可能 我是来泼冷水的
Doubtful. I'm pulling the plug.

668
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,440
{\fs19}-什么 -这应该是

{\fs19}但是 主任
But, Director...

671
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,840
{\fs19}不 我不会再浪费我们的任何时间
No, I'm not gonna waste any more of our time,

672
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,780
{\fs19}任何人力和任何假期
our resources, and all of our holidays

673
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,480
{\fs19}去做他们最擅长的工作
trying to do what they do best.

674
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,820
{\fs19}你看过视频之后 可能就不会这么说了
I'm not sure you'd say that if you saw the video.

675
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,450
{\fs19}那个母亲在哭泣 主任
The mother was sobbing, Director.

676
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,450
{\fs19}一定有更多的隐情
There has to be more to the story.

677
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,090
{\fs19}她还有隐情
Certainly her story.

678
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:00,326
{\fs19}嗨
Hey.

679
00:27:00,395 --> 00:27:02,462
{\fs19}所以 没有目击者
So, no witnesses,

680
00:27:02,531 --> 00:27:04,831
{\fs19}而且我们查过了便利店和周围的邻居
and we all but papered the walls of the convenience store

681
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,711
{\fs19}就差在墙上贴寻人启事了 没有人认识她
and the neighborhood around it. Nobody knows her.

682
00:27:06,735 --> 00:27:08,735
{\fs19}我的小Nicky怎样了
How's my Little Nicky?

683
00:27:08,804 --> 00:27:11,304
{\fs19}嗯 我说他看起来更适合叫Logan
Hmm. Looks more like a Logan to me.

684
00:27:11,373 --> 00:27:13,173
{\fs19}巧了 我之前想的也是Logan
Hey! I was thinking Logan, too.

685
00:27:13,241 --> 00:27:15,575
{\fs19}-是吗 -是的 或者叫Cody
- Yeah. - Yeah, or like a Cody.

686
00:27:15,644 --> 00:27:17,221
{\fs19}但是 我想他看起来更像叫Luke的
See, I'm thinking he looks more like a Luke.

687
00:27:17,245 --> 00:27:18,745
{\fs19}哦 又一个源自星战的名字 是吗
Oh, another Star Wars name, huh?

688
00:27:18,814 --> 00:27:21,114
{\fs19}我相信 Logan是金刚狼
Well, I believe, uh, Logan is Wolverine.

689
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:23,483
{\fs19}叫他超人的名字怎么样 Kent Clark
How about, uh, Superman? Kent? Clark?

690
00:27:23,552 --> 00:27:25,618
{\fs19}好吧 我们可能还没找到
Well, we may not have found

691
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:28,421
{\fs19}孩子的母亲 Gibbs 但是这宝宝倒是一点儿也不缺
the mom yet, Gibbs, but this baby certainly has no shortage

{\fs19}叔叔们和阿姨们
of aunts and uncles.

693

{\fs19}你好 超人
Hey, Superman.

694
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:37,130
{\fs19}-我们还是叫他超人吧 -Albert是个更好的名字
- Let's just call him Superman. - Albert's a better name.

695
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:39,332
{\fs19}我想说的是 这事没必要把Gibbs牵涉进来
I'm just saying, there was no need to involve Gibbs.

696
00:27:39,401 --> 00:27:41,301
{\fs19}当然有必要
There is always a need.

697
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:43,269
{\fs19}瞧  Kasie 如果你想帮助Jerome 你就该
Look, if you want to help Jerome, Kasie, you got

- to let other people help you. - I let you help me.

699
00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:46,539
{\fs19}但我不是Gibbs
I'm not Gibbs.

700
00:27:46,608 --> 00:27:48,553
{\fs19}你父亲肯定也不是独自一人帮助这么多
Surely your dad didn't help all these homeless vets

701
00:27:48,577 --> 00:27:49,976
{\fs19}无家可归的老兵们的 对吗
all by himself, did he?

702
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:51,511
{\fs19}不 我不知道
No. I don't know.

703
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,847
{\fs19}只是别把我父亲扯进来
Look, just leave my dad out of this.

704
00:27:53,915 --> 00:27:55,493
{\fs19}又是这样 每次我提到你的父亲
There you go again. Every time I bring up your dad,

705
00:27:55,517 --> 00:27:57,317
{\fs19}-你就转移话题 -不 我没有
- you change the subject. - No, I don't.

Now find a face already.

707
00:27:59,788 --> 00:28:02,188
{\fs19}就是他 不是吗
It was him, wasn't it?

708
00:28:02,257 --> 00:28:04,524
{\fs19}Jerome让你想起来的
Who Jerome reminded you of.

709
00:28:04,593 --> 00:28:06,626
{\fs19}就是你的父亲
It was your dad.

710
00:28:06,695 --> 00:28:08,828
{\fs19}你看到Jerome的尸体的时候
You got all weird when

711
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,497
{\fs19}就变得很奇怪 跟你听到别人
you saw Jerome's body, the same weird

712
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:12,565
{\fs19}提起你父亲时一样的那种奇怪
that you got at any mention of your dad.

713
00:28:12,634 --> 00:28:14,501
{\fs19}你看 我
Look, I...

714
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:16,035
{\fs19}我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

715
00:28:16,104 --> 00:28:17,871
{\fs19}我越界了 我并不想
I overstepped there. I didn't mean to...

716
00:28:17,939 --> 00:28:20,540
{\fs19}不 不 你是对的
No. No, you're right.

717
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:22,475
{\fs19}我变得奇怪了
I get weird.

718
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:27,046
{\fs19}Jerome让我想到了我见过的第一具尸体
Jerome reminded me of the first dead body I ever saw.

719
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:29,315
{\fs19}那是你父亲
It was your father.

720
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:32,585
{\fs19}也是那样的年纪 海军纹身
About the same age, Navy tattoo.

721
00:28:34,723 --> 00:28:37,323
{\fs19}让我想到我们一起过的最后一个圣诞
It just reminded me of our last Christmas together.

722
00:28:37,392 --> 00:28:39,392
{\fs19}在打开礼物的过程中
In the middle of opening presents,

723
00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:41,127
{\fs19}我提到关于完成研究生学业
I mentioned having second thoughts

724
00:28:41,196 --> 00:28:44,564
{\fs19}我有其他的想法 这让他 他不是很高兴
about finishing grad school, and he was... he was not happy.

725
00:28:46,635 --> 00:28:48,768
{\fs19}你知道 他总是说只要我提高自己
You know, he always said I had a knack

726
00:28:48,837 --> 00:28:51,037
{\fs19}我就能掌握窍门 而且
if I would just apply myself, and...

727
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:54,240
{\fs19}噢 不用多说 那天就那么不欢而散了
oh, needless to say, it ruined the day,

728
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:58,211
{\fs19}之后的每一天都过得不安生
and most every day after that,

729
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,046
{\fs19}直到他离世的那天
right up till the day he died.

730
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:03,283
{\fs19}-那是什么时候 -在那一个月之后 毫无征兆
- When was that? - A month later, out of nowhere.

731
00:29:03,351 --> 00:29:06,553
{\fs19}在他送邮件的时候心脏病突发
Just had a heart attack on his mail route.

732
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:08,254
{\fs19}你知道吗 急救人员说
You know, the medics said

733
00:29:08,323 --> 00:29:10,790
{\fs19}他还没倒地前就已经死了
that he was dead before he even hit the ground.

734
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:13,359
{\fs19}妈妈无法承受去确认尸体的痛苦 所以我去了
Mom couldn't bear to I.D. the body, so I did.

735
00:29:13,428 --> 00:29:16,062
{\fs19}Kasie 我很抱歉
Kasie, I'm so sorry.

You know, the day after that, I went back to grad school,

737
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,467
{\fs19}然后尽全力学习 而且他是对的
and I busted my butt, and he was right.

738
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,937
{\fs19}我掌握了诀窍
I had a knack.

739

And within a week, I started working with Ducky, and...

740
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:28,942
{\fs19}天哪 我从心底知道
man, I knew in my heart

741
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,144
{\fs19}我终于走上了正轨
that I was on the right track after all.

742
00:29:31,213 --> 00:29:34,714

00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:26,666
{\fs19}嗨 嘿 我们只是想来谈谈
Hey, hey, we just want to talk.

764
00:30:31,172 --> 00:30:34,307
{\fs19}这不是我的 我发誓 我发誓
It's not mine, I swear. I swear.

765
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:36,209
{\fs19}没关系的
It's okay.

766
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:49,973
{\fs19}你这是毒品正好起效了 对吧 Tanya
You pretty high right now, Tanya?

767
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,389
{\fs19}一点也没有
I'm not high at all.

768
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:53,525
{\fs19}我几个月没沾过了
I've been clean for months.

769
00:30:53,593 --> 00:30:55,927
{\fs19}我们能联系谁吗
There anybody we can call?

770
00:30:55,996 --> 00:30:58,596
{\fs19}-父母 -对 对 想得美
- Parents? - Yeah. Yeah, right.

771
00:30:58,665 --> 00:31:02,567
{\fs19}不 我一怀孕他们就把我扫地出门了
No. They kicked me out as soon as I got pregnant.

772
00:31:02,636 --> 00:31:05,436
{\fs19}然后我的男朋友不告而别了
Then my boyfriend skipped town.

773
00:31:05,505 --> 00:31:08,273
{\fs19}就是那时领养机构帮我和Pete与Judy联系上了
That's when the adoption agency hooked me up with Pete and Judy.

774
00:31:08,341 --> 00:31:10,475
{\fs19}-他们姓什么 -他们不会告诉这个的
- Last name? - They don't tell you that.

775
00:31:10,544 --> 00:31:12,977
{\fs19}但他们是很好的人
They were nice people, though.

776
00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:15,413
{\fs19}特别好的人
So nice.

777
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:18,917
{\fs19}他们出钱帮我戒毒还承担了我的医保
They helped pay for my rehab and my medical care,

778
00:31:18,985 --> 00:31:22,620
{\fs19}只为有一个机会能领养我的孩子
all just for a chance to adopt my baby.

779
00:31:24,224 --> 00:31:26,491
{\fs19}Vicious什么时候出现的
When did Vicious come along?

780
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,493
{\fs19}就在我将要生产前
Right before I delivered.

781
00:31:30,063 --> 00:31:32,397
{\fs19}我戒毒前曾经是他的顾客
I used to be a customer before I got clean.

782
00:31:32,465 --> 00:31:36,334
{\fs19}当他看到我肚子大了 他给了我一万的现金
When he saw me knocked up, he offered me ten grand cash.

783
00:31:36,403 --> 00:31:38,403
{\fs19}我从来没见过那么多钱
More money than I had ever seen.

784
00:31:38,471 --> 00:31:40,171
{\fs19}所以我撒谎了
So I lied.

785
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,908
{\fs19}我告诉Pete和Judy我想留下自己的孩子
I told Pete and Judy that I wanted to keep the baby.

786
00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:46,010
{\fs19}让他们伤心我感觉很不好
And I felt bad for breaking their hearts,

787
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,779
{\fs19}但是那些领养机构
but adoption agencies--

788
00:31:47,848 --> 00:31:50,648
{\fs19}宝宝一旦出生了他们就不再付钱了
once the baby comes, they don't pay you.

789
00:31:50,717 --> 00:31:54,452
{\fs19}而且我拿到钱的那一刻就知道我错了
And I knew it was wrong the second I took the envelope.

790
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:57,021
{\fs19}但那样的机会 可不是
But opportunities like that, they don't...

791
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,124
{\fs19}不是常有的 可能不会再有
they don't come around every... maybe ever.

792
00:32:00,193 --> 00:32:03,161
{\fs19}我以为我会没事的
I thought I'd be okay,

793
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,597
{\fs19}但之后我发现Vicious死了
but then I found out that Vicious was dead,

794
00:32:05,665 --> 00:32:08,700
{\fs19}而且 而且 现在我甚至不知道我的孩子在哪里
and-and-and... and now I don't even know where my baby is.

795
00:32:10,737 --> 00:32:12,837
{\fs19}Tanya 他在我们那里
Tanya, we have him.

796
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,241
{\fs19}真的吗
You do?

797
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,209
{\fs19}是的 他很安全
Yes. He's safe.

798
00:32:18,278 --> 00:32:21,045
{\fs19}这
Wha...

799
00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:26,651
{\fs19}领养机构的名称是什么
What's the name of the agency?

800
00:32:28,722 --> 00:32:31,022
{\fs19}这改变了所有事情
This changes everything.

801
00:32:31,091 --> 00:32:33,191
{\fs19}为什么 为什么这改变了所有事情
Why-why does it change everything?

802
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,293
{\fs19}我是说 这可能是个暗示
I mean, maybe this is a sign.

803
00:32:35,362 --> 00:32:37,729
{\fs19}我一直 一直在这里呆坐着
I've been... I've been sitting here,

804
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:40,031
{\fs19}而且我一直在想或许
and I've been thinking maybe...

805
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,799
{\fs19}或许如果我一开始就留下我的孩子
maybe if I would've just kept my baby,

806
00:32:41,868 --> 00:32:44,002
{\fs19}我就能给所有人省去不少麻烦了
then I would've saved everybody from all this trouble.

807
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,237
{\fs19}-不 不 不 不 -为什么不
- No, no, no, no. - Why not?

808
00:32:46,306 --> 00:32:47,906
{\fs19}我现在有钱了
I've got money now.

809
00:32:47,974 --> 00:32:49,574
{\fs19}我能给我们找个地方
I could get us a place.

810
00:32:49,643 --> 00:32:50,675
{\fs19}一个不错的地方
A nice one.

811
00:32:52,379 --> 00:32:54,913
{\fs19}我是说 或许这就是 这就是我第二次机会
I mean, maybe this-this could be my second chance.

812
00:32:54,981 --> 00:32:59,384
{\fs19}嗨 Tanya 你现在最好不要有孩子
Hey, Tanya, y-your best chance is without a baby right now.

813
00:32:59,452 --> 00:33:03,388
{\fs19}而且你宝宝最好的机会就是和那对养父母在一起
And your baby's best chance is with those adoptive parents.

814
00:33:07,294 --> 00:33:09,994
{\fs19}这样的机会
This opportunity...

815
00:33:10,063 --> 00:33:12,997
{\fs19}不是经常有的
doesn't come around much.

816
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:14,866
{\fs19}你已经走到这一步了
You have come this far,

817
00:33:14,935 --> 00:33:17,068
{\fs19}你还可以走得更远
but you could go so much further,

818
00:33:17,137 --> 00:33:20,571
{\fs19}你的宝宝也一样
and so could your baby.

819
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,007
{\fs19}只要你放弃他
If you let him go.

820
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:29,747
{\fs19}你看起来很确定 你怎么会知道
You seem so sure. How do you know?

821
00:33:29,816 --> 00:33:33,117
{\fs19}因为我确实知道 好吧
Because I know. All right?

822
00:33:33,186 --> 00:33:35,887
{\fs19}我们一生总会有后悔的事情
We all end up with regrets in our life,

823
00:33:35,956 --> 00:33:37,622
{\fs19}但是一定不会后悔的是
but one thing you will never regret

824
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:41,225
{\fs19}让你的孩子有了更好的生活
is giving your baby a better life.

825
00:33:43,196 --> 00:33:45,964
{\fs19}这比什么都重要 我就是知道
More than anything else, I know that.

826
00:33:46,032 --> 00:33:49,400
{\fs19}而且我会给你支持帮助你
And I'll help you get the support you need

827
00:33:49,469 --> 00:33:52,470
{\fs19}重新开始 改变生活
to get clean and turn your life around.

828
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:53,871
{\fs19}我保证
I promise.

829
00:33:57,344 --> 00:33:59,944
{\fs19}-好吗 好的 -好的 我会的 谢谢
- Okay? Okay. - Okay, I will. Thanks.

830
00:34:00,013 --> 00:34:04,248
{\fs19}Tanya Vicious对这个宝宝有什么计划吗
Tanya... what did Vicious have planned for the baby?

831
00:34:04,317 --> 00:34:07,819
{\fs19}问题就在这里 这不止是钱的事情
Well, that's just the thing. It wasn't all about the money.

832
00:34:07,887 --> 00:34:09,954
{\fs19}对Vicious来说就是钱
It was to Vicious.

833
00:34:10,023 --> 00:34:12,090
{\fs19}他想把宝宝卖给谁
Who was he selling the baby to?

834
00:34:12,158 --> 00:34:15,426
{\fs19}他说有个很不错的家庭正等着呢
He said he had a nice home lined up.

835
00:34:15,495 --> 00:34:17,061
{\fs19}有钱人家
Rich people.

836
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:20,565
{\fs19}好像是医生还是律师什么的
Like, a-a doctor or a lawyer or something.

837
00:34:26,973 --> 00:34:29,474
{\fs19}律师
Lawyer.

838
00:34:32,212 --> 00:34:34,979
{\fs19}让我给你省点时间吧 Gibbs探员
Let me save you some time, Agent Gibbs.

839
00:34:35,048 --> 00:34:37,181
{\fs19}这已经是最糟糕的一次平安夜了
It's already been the worst Christmas Eve ever.

840
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,017
{\fs19}是吗 怎么了
Yeah. How?

841
00:34:39,085 --> 00:34:41,652
{\fs19}我妻子已经发现我 为了实现
My wife figured out what kind of strings I was pulling

842
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:43,254
{\fs19}领养而走后门了
to make this adoption happen.

843
00:34:43,323 --> 00:34:46,157
{\fs19}你把付钱给一个毒贩子让他给你
You call paying a drug dealer to buy you a baby

844
00:34:46,226 --> 00:34:48,159
{\fs19}买个孩子叫做 走后门
"pulling strings"?

845
00:34:48,228 --> 00:34:50,194
{\fs19}太蠢了 我知道
Stupid, I know.

846
00:34:50,263 --> 00:34:52,697
{\fs19}-噢 这可不只是愚蠢了 -在我帮Albert
- Oh, it is way more than stupid. - After I got Albert

847
00:34:52,766 --> 00:34:55,967
{\fs19}拿到了辩诉交易之后 他问我他能做什么报答
the plea deal, he said if there was anything he could do.

848
00:34:56,036 --> 00:34:57,702
{\fs19}他说任何事都行
And he meant anything.

849
00:34:57,771 --> 00:35:00,104
{\fs19}所以你就说 来个宝宝怎么样
So you said, "How about a baby?"

850
00:35:00,173 --> 00:35:01,853
{\fs19}那时我们第三次领养申请刚被驳回
Our third adoption had just fallen through,

851
00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:03,274
{\fs19}我们都崩溃了
and we were crushed.

852
00:35:03,343 --> 00:35:04,776
{\fs19}Albert说只要
Albert said

853
00:35:04,844 --> 00:35:07,045
{\fs19}两万五 他就能帮我们找来
for 25 grand, he would find us

854
00:35:07,113 --> 00:35:09,280
{\fs19}一个健康的愿意生育的母亲
a healthy and willing birth mother.

855
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:10,495
{\fs19}两万五千美元
$25,000.

856
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:12,695
{\fs19}我太想给我妻子一个完整的家庭了
I was desperate to give my wife a family.

857
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:16,487
{\fs19}从来没想过会因为这个出人命
Never expecting anyone was gonna die over it.

858
00:35:21,461 --> 00:35:23,394
{\fs19}嗨
Hey.

859
00:35:23,463 --> 00:35:25,797
{\fs19}-听说好消息了吗 -是的
- Hear the good news? - Yeah.

860
00:35:25,865 --> 00:35:29,367
{\fs19}啊 太好了 我是说 苦乐参半 但至少我们
Uh, great. I mean, bittersweet, but at least we can find

861
00:35:29,436 --> 00:35:31,040
{\fs19}能找到原来的养父母了
the original adoptive parents now.

862
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,455
{\fs19}抱歉 你是要说什么吗
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something?

863
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:33,572
{\fs19}哦 没有 只是
Oh, no. Just...

864
00:35:33,573 --> 00:35:36,808
{\fs19}只是在删除一些垃圾邮件 你要回家了吗
just deleting a bunch of spam. You headed home?

865
00:35:36,876 --> 00:35:38,543
{\fs19}是的 我只是想 来这看看
Yeah, I just wanted to, uh, come by.

866
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:41,412
{\fs19}留下一点东西 Jimmy 为什么
Drop off a little something. Jimmy, why?

867
00:35:41,481 --> 00:35:43,815
{\fs19}你不必这么做的 我也没给你什么
You didn't have to. I didn't get you anything.

868
00:35:43,883 --> 00:35:46,017
{\fs19}你已经给了 相信我
Yes, you did. Trust me.

869
00:35:46,086 --> 00:35:48,486
{\fs19}-我是现在打开还是 -我就是这么打算的 是的
- Do I open it now or...? - That would be the idea, yeah.

870
00:35:48,555 --> 00:35:51,422
{\fs19}-你就打开吧 -好吧 好的
- Just o-open it. - Yeah. Okay.

871
00:35:53,593 --> 00:35:55,893
{\fs19}这个不是Jerome的
It's not Jerome's,

872
00:35:55,962 --> 00:35:57,728
{\fs19}但这个是某人的
but it's-it's someone's.

873
00:35:57,797 --> 00:35:59,897
{\fs19}某个不再需要它的人 我想
Someone who doesn't need it anymore, I guess.

874
00:35:59,966 --> 00:36:02,166
{\fs19}-谁 -我不知道
- Who? - I don't know.

875
00:36:02,235 --> 00:36:05,169
{\fs19}但这就是你去找Gibbs的原因
But that is why you involve Gibbs.

876
00:36:05,238 --> 00:36:07,105
{\fs19}他认识一些人
He knows people.

877
00:36:10,577 --> 00:36:12,343
{\fs19}谢谢你 Jimmy
Thank you, Jimmy.

878
00:36:13,446 --> 00:36:15,513
{\fs19}圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas.

879
00:36:16,816 --> 00:36:19,750
{\fs19}噢 Kasie
Oh, and Kasie?

880
00:36:19,819 --> 00:36:21,886
{\fs19}我非常相信命运
I'm a big believer in fate.

881
00:36:21,955 --> 00:36:23,888
{\fs19}我知道你父亲的死亡
I know there's nothing good that can be said

882
00:36:23,957 --> 00:36:26,023
{\fs19}不能说是什么好事
about your dad passing away,

883
00:36:26,092 --> 00:36:29,227
{\fs19}但抛开别的不说 它引导你到了这里
but if nothing else, it led you here.

884
00:36:29,295 --> 00:36:30,862
{\fs19}遇上了我们
To us.

885
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,932
{\fs19}我有时就想 可能我在天堂的父亲
I sometimes think maybe my dad gave me a little...

886
00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:37,368
{\fs19}给了我一个机会
shove from above.

887
00:36:37,437 --> 00:36:39,370
{\fs19}我们都很高兴他这么做了
Well, we're all glad that he did.

888
00:36:47,313 --> 00:36:48,913
{\fs19}嗨
Hey.

889
00:36:48,982 --> 00:36:51,649
{\fs19}我们已经找到窍门了
