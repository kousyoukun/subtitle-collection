1
00:00:04,398 --> 00:00:05,798
我不确定哪个闻着更恶心
I'm not sure what smells worse,

2
00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:07,867
水还是垃圾
the water or the trash.

3
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:09,835
目前而言 我觉得最恶心的是我们
At this point, I'd say it's us.

4
00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:13,372
我是怎么被你套路来这儿的
How did I let you talk me into this?

5
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:14,807
要怪就怪耶鲁
Blame Yale.

6
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:16,509
是他们认为
They're the ones who find applicants

7
00:00:16,577 --> 00:00:19,812
做过社区服务的申请人更受欢迎
with community service hours to be highly desirable.

8
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:23,949
难以置信 我能通玩水球和曲棍球
Unbelievable. I'm all-state in water polo and lacrosse,

9
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:25,985
我的祖先乘坐五月花号来到这里
and my ancestors came over on the <i>Mayflower.</i>

10
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:28,454
没有比这更全面的了
It doesn't get more well-rounded than that.

11
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:32,858
那是什么
What is that?

12
00:00:32,927 --> 00:00:35,694
-一只靴子 -怎么会有人丢只靴子
- A boot? - How does somebody lose a boot?

13
00:00:40,935 --> 00:00:42,868
要弄脏了
That's gonna stain.

14
00:00:54,048 --> 00:00:55,748
哦 去你的吧
Oh, screw this.

15
00:00:55,816 --> 00:00:57,683
耶鲁可以把我列到等候名单里了
Yale can wait-list me.

McGee和我忙得累死累活
McGee and I have been working our asses off.

28

Oh, really?

29
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:55,974
哈 我很确定你钻研这个是非常用心的
Ha! Diligent research, I'm sure. Hmm.

30
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:57,843
好了 让我看看你们画了什么
All right, well, let's see what you two drew.

31
00:01:57,912 --> 00:01:59,545
我们有点匆忙
We were rushed.

32
00:01:59,613 --> 00:02:02,047
不是最好的 但
It's-it's not the best, but...

33
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:03,315
哇喔
Oh, wow.

Jimmy, I had no idea you could draw like this, man.

36
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:08,053

棒极了 不是吗
It's amazing, isn't it?

42
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:19,865
警方的证物袋真的给这幅画
The, uh, police evidence bag really adds

43
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:22,034
-添加了很多现实主义色彩 -质感
- a level of realism to it. - Texture.

44
00:02:22,103 --> 00:02:23,702
没有什么比一个死亡的海军更现实

45
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:24,937
带上装备

Twins paint that, McGee?

50
00:02:33,748 --> 00:02:35,280
并不是 老大
Not exactly, boss.

51
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:38,584
Gibbs伤害了我 他深深伤害了我
Gibbs cut me. He cut me deep.

52
00:02:38,652 --> 00:02:40,919
每个人都是批评家 走吧
Everyone's a critic. Come on.

免受塑料吸管和其他东西的伤害
from, you know, plastic straws and all that.

57
00:02:54,268 --> 00:02:55,601
吸管有害吗
Straws are bad?

58
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:57,114
塑料吸管于海洋生物就是毒药
Plastic straws are poison to sea life.

59
00:02:57,138 --> 00:02:58,982
-看这个录像 -不 不要看那个录像

你们俩是
What time did you guys

65
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:09,481
什么时候到的
arrive on the scene?

66
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,150
上午6点
6:00 a.m.

67
00:03:11,218 --> 00:03:12,796
你们看到什么异常情况吗
Did you guys see anything out of the ordinary?

68
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,353
你说尸体不算异常情况吗
You mean other than the dead body?

69
00:03:15,723 --> 00:03:17,656
实际上 等下
Actually, hold up.

70
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:20,259
你想让我们看见什么吗
Did you want us to see something?

71
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:22,561
啥
What?

72
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,965
也许如果我们说了你想听的
Maybe if we tell you what you want to hear,

73
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:29,802
NCIS可以代表我们给耶鲁招生委员会
NCIS could write a couple of letters of commendation

74
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,670
写几封推荐信
to the Yale Admissions Board on our behalf?

75
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:35,174
好吧 耶鲁
Okay. Yale?

76
00:03:35,242 --> 00:03:36,875
-对 -继续做梦吧 兄弟
- Yeah. - Keep dreaming, buddy.

77
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:39,778

What do you got, Palmer?

78
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:41,180
除了断掉的脖子
Well, other than the broken neck,

79
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:42,526
没有其他外在伤痕

-Torres探员 -有死亡时间吗

尸体的情况显示他
Condition of the body points to him

82
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:46,985
在水里待了一段时间
being in the water for some time.

83
00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:48,287
我估计将近一个礼拜
I'd say close to a week.

84
00:03:48,355 --> 00:03:51,523
我无法通过指纹确认他的身份
I wasn't able to confirm his identity using fingerprints.

85
00:03:51,592 --> 00:03:53,292
孔雀鱼先下手了
Yeah, the guppies got to him first.

86
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,327
这就是生命的轮回啊 绅士们
That is the circle of life, gentlemen.

87
00:03:58,232 --> 00:03:59,431
顺便说一句
I mean that in the most

88
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,877
我对死者还是满怀敬意的
respectful way possible, by the way.

89
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:02,145
我们在他口袋里找了他的士兵证
We found his military I.D. in his pocket,

90
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:04,336
根据他制服上的姓名条
and according to the name tag on his uniform,

91
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:07,773
我们的受害者是二级军士Richard Granger
our victim is Senior Chief Richard Granger,

92
00:04:07,842 --> 00:04:10,209
就任于国防后勤局
assigned to the Defense Logistics Agency.

93
00:04:10,277 --> 00:04:13,378
Jethro 我给尸体做了个快速检查
Ah, Jethro, I gave the body a quick examination.

94
00:04:13,447 --> 00:04:14,613
外部并没有
While there was no

95
00:04:14,682 --> 00:04:16,548
明显的伤痕
outward appearance of trauma...

96

嘿 Gibbs
Hey, Gibbs.

100
00:04:22,957 --> 00:04:24,556
我们有个大问题
We have a big problem.

101
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,059
我刚和国防后勤局通了电话
I just got off the phone with the Defense Logistics Agency,

102
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:29,828
就是二级军士Granger工作的地方
where Senior Chief Granger worked.

103
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:31,463
知道他们为什么没有上报无故缺勤吗
Any reason they didn't report him UA?

104
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:32,965
就是这个问题
That's the thing.

105
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:37,536
跟我通话的人就是二级军士Granger
Uh, the person I spoke to was Senior Chief Granger.

106
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:38,804
他还活着
He's alive.

107
00:04:38,873 --> 00:04:41,406
那他是谁
Then who is this?

108
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:53,609
你认识他吗
<i>Do you recognize him?</i>

109
00:04:53,677 --> 00:04:55,043
天呐
My God.

110
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:56,218
不认识 他是谁
No. Who is he?

111
00:04:56,242 --> 00:04:57,780
我们也想知道
That's what we want to know.

112
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:00,148
他是怎么拿到你的军士证和制服的
How'd he get your military I.D. and your uniform?

113
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,728
我的公寓上周被非法闯入了
My apartment was broken into last week,

114
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:03,151
我的一些装备被偷
and some of my gear was stolen.

115
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,387
我填了警方报告 但是没有回音
I filed a police report, but nothing came of it.

116
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:07,389
知道为什么有人想
Any idea why someone would want

117
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,891
假扮你吗 Granger军士
to impersonate you, Chief Granger?

118
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,126
毫无头绪
Not a clue.

119
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:13,462
我是后勤仓库的人事员
I'm a personnel clerk in a logistics depot.

120
00:05:13,531 --> 00:05:15,130
不是个抢手的工作
Not exactly a sexy job,

121
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,279
除非你迷恋彩色编码组织图
unless you're into color-coded organizational charts.

122
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,403
稍等
Hold on.

123
00:05:21,472 --> 00:05:23,672
我需要保护吗
Do I need protection or something?

124
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,374
假扮我的人被杀了
A guy pretending to be me was killed.

125
00:05:25,442 --> 00:05:27,509
这是我被盯上了的意思吗
Does that mean I'm being targeted?

126
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:29,011
谁告诉你他被杀了
Who said he was killed?

127
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,713
没多少人是因为自然原因死在波托马克河的
Not many people end up in the Potomac from natural causes.

128
00:05:31,782 --> 00:05:32,948
呃
Mm.

129
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:44,059
噢
Oh.

130
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:46,194
很抱歉 医生
I am so sorry, Doctor. I...

131
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,263
我打算把我的东西都收走
I meant to clear all my stuff out of here

132
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:50,332
既然你已经全职回归NCIS了
now that you're back here at NCIS full-time.

133
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:51,934
-Palmer医生 -我知道 我知道
- Dr. Palmer. - I know, I know.

134
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:56,438
一个整齐的工作室才是高效率的工作室
An organized workspace is an efficient workspace.

135
00:05:56,507 --> 00:06:00,008
是的 你说得没错 但我只是想评价下你的画
Yes, it is, but I was about to commend you on this drawing.

136
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:02,945
-哦 是吗 -是的 细节惊人
- Oh, really? - Yes, amazing detail.

137
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:05,080
我特别喜欢你
I particularly like the way you've drawn

138
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:08,717
画上下腔静脉的方式
the superior and inferior vena cava.

139
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,919
看来你拿着画笔跟拿着手术刀
It seems you are as skillful with a pencil

140
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:12,721
一样的灵巧熟练
as you are with a scalpel.

141
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,391
希望我不会把两者混淆 那就糟了
Hopefully, I don't get the two confused. That could get messy.

142
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:21,029
没错
Right.

143
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:22,731
你回来真好 医生
It's good to have you back here, Doctor.

144
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,578
你不在这 感觉都不一样了
Things weren't the same around here without you.

145
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:26,902
我的图书之旅倒是个令人愉悦的改变
Yeah, it's a welcome change from my book tour.

146
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:30,305
嗨 Ducky 你打电话了 -是的 我们的检查结果是
Hey, Ducky. You rang? Yeah, our examination

147
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:32,407
正确的 死因是脊椎骨
was correct-- the cause of death

148
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,710
C3关节的骨折
was a fracture to the C3 vertebra.

149
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:36,745
但骨折不是因为坠入水中
But it wasn't from the fall into the water.

150
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:38,380
受害人在那之前就死了
The victim was dead beforehand.

151
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:39,449
所以不是自杀？
So not a suicide?

152
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:41,650
除非他能先把自己脖子
Not unless he broke his own neck

153
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:43,952
扭断再让自己翻滚到水里去
and then somehow managed to roll himself into the water.

154
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:47,823
折断自己脖子然后自己再翻滚入水
Broke his own neck and rolled himself into the water?

155
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:50,459
你知道吗 我还没写过这种故事呢
You know, I don't have a story for that one.

156
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:55,597
噢 这倒是新鲜
Oh, that's never happened before.

157
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,899
我这会儿非常不舒服
I'm very uncomfortable right now.

158
00:06:57,968 --> 00:06:59,901
哦 我也是
Oh, so am I.

159
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,069
请求继续进行
Permission to proceed?

160
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:02,471
批准了
Granted.

161
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:04,172
好的 在我们的检查过程中
All right, during our examination,

162
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:06,575
我们发现受害人的腿部有一根
we found a metal rod in the victim's leg

163
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:08,010
之前手术放入的金属杆
from a previous surgery.

164
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:09,678
我在系统里查了下序列号
I ran the serial number in the system,

165
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:11,113
有一个匹配的
came up with a hit.

166
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,448
-那么受害人是谁 -来见过受害人
- So who's our victim? <i>- Meet our victim</i>

167
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,685
冒牌海军 Wesley Moore 他31岁了
and Navy impersonator, Wesley Moore. He's 31.

168
00:07:16,754 --> 00:07:18,654
曾是自由网络系统工程师
He's a freelance cyber systems engineer.

169
00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:20,989
未婚 无子女 无亲属
Unmarried, no kids, no next of kin,

170
00:07:21,058 --> 00:07:22,858
这就解释了为什么
which explains why he was missing for a week

171
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:25,427
他失踪了一周也没人报警 -犯罪记录呢
and no one reported it. - Criminal record?

172
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:28,263
除了一些学生贷款延迟返还 这人没什么问题
Other than a few late student loan payments, this guy's clean.

173
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:30,076
是的 Moore在八年前因为腿部受伤
Yeah, Moore had a brief stint in the military

174
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,767
离开海军候补军官学校之前
eight years ago before washing out

175
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:34,169
之前曾在军中短暂服役
of Marine Officer Candidate School after a leg injury.

176
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:35,682
他遇害的那晚有什么行动吗
What about his movements the night he was killed?

177
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,673
我们根据Moore从高级军士长Granger
We tracked Moore's steps with the I.D. he stole

178
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:39,007
那里偷到的证件追踪他的足迹
from Senior Chief Granger.

179
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:40,609
他用证件获取了
He used it to gain access

180
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:42,277
进入国防部后勤署的权限
to the Defense Logistics Agency.

181
00:07:42,346 --> 00:07:43,979
大门的安保镜头捕捉到
And security cameras at the gate

182
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:45,814
他的车在上周三
captured his vehicle entering the premises

183
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,383
晚上九点进入了后勤署
at 2100 hours last Wednesday.

184
00:07:48,452 --> 00:07:49,718
是的 他两个小时后离开了
Yeah, he exited two hours later.

185
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:50,864
之后  Moore去向不明
After that, Moore fell off the grid.

186
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,287
对车的通缉令已经发出去了
BOLO's already out on the car.

187
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:55,123
他为什么要溜进国防部后勤署呢
Why'd he sneak into the DLA?

188
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:57,392
为了黑进国防部的保密通信
To hack into the DoD's classified message traffic.

189
00:07:57,461 --> 00:07:59,061
我在查他获取了哪些信息
I'm working on what he accessed,

190
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:00,840
但是海外军队部署相关的
but sensitive data on troops' movements overseas

191
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:02,564
敏感信息可能已经泄露了
might have been compromised.

192
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:05,133
而且我们手上有一个严重的安全漏洞
And we got a serious security breach on our hands.

193
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:06,635
是 我是Gibbs
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

194
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:08,181
Hi Gibbs 你有时间吗
Hi, Gibbs. Do you have a minute?

195
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:09,371
好的 马上下去
Yeah, be right down.

196
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,373
找出Moore在追踪什么
Find out what Moore was after.

197
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:20,348
水流情况
Water currents?

198
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,651
是的 我还以为一个造船的人
Yeah, you'd think a person who builds boats

199
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,554
会觉得潮汐变化十分美妙
would find tide shifts more fascinating.

200
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:26,702
一条线索更能吸引我
A lead would be fascinating.

201
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,256
这就是线索
This is the lead.

202
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:30,158
怎么 你以为我让你下来
What, did you think I invited you down here

203
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:33,462
就是为了有趣的无声交流吗
for some riveting nonverbal conversation?

204
00:08:34,565 --> 00:08:36,598
好吧 呃 继续
Okay, uh, moving on.

205
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:39,501
我在分析过去六天的海岸
So, I have been analyzing the coastal tide patterns

206
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,269
潮汐模式
for the past six days,

207
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:44,673
从Moore尸体冲上岸的地方倒推
working backwards from where Wesley Moore's body washed up

208
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:47,709
看他的尸体从哪里入水的
to determine where his body first entered the water.

209
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,678
-缩小搜查范围 -嘿
- Narrowed down the search grid. - Hey!

210
00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:52,180
现在我们终于合拍了
Now we're on the same wavelength.

211
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:53,749
好吧
Okay.

212
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:58,553
但你不喜欢双关 好的 很高兴知道这点
And not a fan of puns. Okay, um, good to know.

213
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:01,156
好吧 如果我的计算是正确的
Okay, if my calculations are correct,

214
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:02,491
Moore的尸体是在
Moore's body was dumped

215
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,595
距北部旧城附近海岸线两英里的范围内
somewhere within a two-mile stretch of shoreline near...

216
00:09:06,663 --> 00:09:07,963
被抛下水的
North Old Town.

217
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:12,367
呃 Gibbs 我有一些发现了
Uh, Gibbs, I've got something.

218
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:15,570
Wesley Moore的邮件和通话记录表明
Wesley Moore's e-mail and phone records indicate

219
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,974
他接到了一位驻扎在阿富汗喀布尔的
he received several messages from Captain Alicia Voit,

220
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:22,210
Alicia Voit上尉的一些信息
a Marine stationed in Kabul, Afghanistan.

221
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,912
在他们两周前的
And in their last correspondence,

222
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,481
最后一次通信中 Voit给Moore发了一封
two weeks ago, Voit e-mailed Moore

223
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,284
包含12名死亡军人姓名的电子邮件
the names of 12 dead Marines.

224
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:30,754
别告诉我又是一个刺杀清单
Please tell me this is not another hit list.

225
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,387
不是
No.

226
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:33,121
不是那样 那些军人在Voit
Not so much. All of those Marines died

227
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,757
发邮件之前就死亡了
prior to Voit's message being sent.

228
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,225
她为什么把死亡军人的
Why would she message a list

229
00:09:37,294 --> 00:09:39,227
名单发给Moore呢
of deceased Marines' names to Moore?

230
00:09:39,296 --> 00:09:40,595
联系喀布尔的基地
Contact the base in Kabul.

231
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:44,099
-在MTAC里接通Voit -呃 Gibbs
- Get Voit on MTAC. - Uh, Gibbs,

232
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,567
这没法实现
that's impossible.

233
00:09:45,636 --> 00:09:48,770

他们肯定不止是同学关系
They were definitely more than that.

253
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,545
我是说 根据他们的邮件往来和发的社交网站来看
I mean, by their e-mails and social media posts,

254

总部通知我们等你来 我是Park上校
HQ said to expect you. Colonel Park.

278
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:01,354
你是被指派给Voit上尉的护卫吗
You're the Marine escort assigned to Captain Voit?

279
00:12:01,423 --> 00:12:04,957
是的 我的任务是最后一次送她回家
Affirmative. I am tasked with her final transit home.

280
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:07,927
上尉的遗体一小时内应该就会被放行
The captain's remains should be released within the hour.

281
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:11,531
出什么问题了吗
Something wrong?

282
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:13,110
上校不常被分派这类任务吧
Colonels aren't usually assigned these details.

283
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:14,467
军人以服从命令为天职
A Marine goes where he's needed,

284
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:16,035
Gibbs探员
Agent Gibbs.

285
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:18,204
你的目的地是哪里
What's your destination?

286
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:21,074
新泽西州的Strathmere  Voit上尉的家乡
Strathmere, New Jersey. Captain Voit's hometown.

287
00:12:21,142 --> 00:12:24,210
我们会在10点钟出发
Our transport will be departing at 1000 hours.

288
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,713
上校 恐怕你们的出发要推迟了
Colonel, I'm afraid there's going to be a delay.

289
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:29,415
-为什么 -Voit上尉现在是我们正在调查的
- Excuse me? - Captain Voit

290
00:12:29,484 --> 00:12:31,884
一起谋杀案调的一部分了
is now part of an active murder investigation.

291
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:36,923
谋杀调查
Murder investigation?

292
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,469
这件事没人告诉过我
I wasn't informed of that.

293
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:39,693
她的遗体需要送到
Her remains are to be brought

294
00:12:39,694 --> 00:12:42,328
NCIS 直到我们找到更多的答案
to NCIS until we have more answers.

295
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:46,332
我能理解
I understand your...

296
00:12:46,401 --> 00:12:49,168
你的境遇 Gibbs探员
your situation, Agent Gibbs,

297
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:51,037
但我不能允许此事发生
but I cannot allow that.

298
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,073
这不是请求 上校
It's not a request, Colonel.

299
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:57,443
我的任务是把上尉送回家
It's my duty to get the captain home

300
00:12:57,512 --> 00:12:59,645
让她在两天之内得到安息
to be laid to rest in two days.

301
00:12:59,714 --> 00:13:02,115
而我也会尽我所能确保此事按期执行
And I'll do everything I can to ensure that happens.

302
00:13:02,183 --> 00:13:04,517
无意冒犯 但是我觉得这并不够
With all due respect, that's not good enough for me.

303
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:06,953
上校 Voit上尉的死可能与
Colonel, there's a possibility that Captain Voit's death

304
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:09,021
另一起谋杀案有关
is connected to another murder case.

305
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,124
我们需要给两名受害者
We owe it to both victims

306
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:12,825
找出真相
to find out the truth.

307
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:19,065
这一点上我们的追求是一致的
That is something we do agree on.

308
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:23,636
好吧
All right.

309
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:25,838
但是我要跟你一起
But I'm going with you.

310
00:13:25,907 --> 00:13:28,541
别指望我能离开上尉半步
Don't expect me to leave the captain's side.

311
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,842
明白
Understood.

312
00:13:36,017 --> 00:13:37,817
这是什么泥啊
What kind of mud is this?

313
00:13:37,886 --> 00:13:39,819
感觉就像流沙
It feels like quicksand.

314
00:13:39,888 --> 00:13:42,688
你确定搜索范围是在这里吗
Are you sure this is the right search grid?

315
00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:45,069
非常确定 Moore的尸体一定是在 大概 这附近
Oh, yeah, positive. Moore's body had to have entered the water,

316
00:13:45,093 --> 00:13:47,026
掉进了水里
like, around here.

317
00:13:47,095 --> 00:13:50,496
哦 我天 哦 我的天呐
Oh, my... oh, my... oh, my God! Oh, my God!

318
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:52,365
哦 天呐 你看到那些苍蝇有多大了吗
Oh, my God, did you see the size of that fly?

319
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:55,001
看起来就像史前生物
It was, like, prehistoric.

320
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:58,504
呃 就把这当成你成为外勤探员的速成课程
Uh, consider this your crash course on field agent work.

321
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:00,618
是啊 被油污覆盖 还要
Yeah, okay, well, getting covered in grime and, like,

322
00:14:00,642 --> 00:14:04,010
被苍蝇吃掉 并不是很符合你说的
eaten by flies isn't exactly the high-octane experience

323
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:06,212
-及其新颖的体验啊 -时间还长着呢 姐们儿
- you promised. - The day's young, sister.

324
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:08,147
好吧 但是如果我看见哪怕一条蛇 我就...
Fine, but if I see one snake, I am...

325
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:09,916
我就离开这里
I'm out of here.

326
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:11,462
等等 蛇吗 你是在 等一下 你什么意思 有蛇吗
Wait, snake? What are you... Wait, what do you mean, snake?

327
00:14:11,486 --> 00:14:12,663
你说蛇是什么意思
What are you talking about, snakes?

328
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:14,921
哦 没错 它们在沼泽系统里繁衍生息
Oh, yeah. They thrive in swampy ecosystems.

329
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:18,758
好了 好吧
All right, okay.

330
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:20,827
呃 继续坚持
Well, uh... stay on it.

331
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:24,479
搞完这里 我要 我马上回来
Get 'er done. I'm gonna... I'll be right back.

332
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,233
在恐怖电影里 一般说这话的人
Yeah, that's usually what someone says

333
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:28,501
马上就会死掉
right before they're killed in a horror movie,

334
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,603
但是 我确定这完全不一样
but yeah, I'm sure this is totally different.

335
00:14:30,672 --> 00:14:34,040
我爱我的工作 我爱我的工作 我爱我的工作
I love my job, I love my job, I love my job,

336
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:35,441
我爱我的工作 哦
I love my job. Oof!

337
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,677
嗨 伙计
Hey, man.

338
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:39,345
能跟你说句话吗
Can I have a word?

339
00:14:40,615 --> 00:14:42,215
嗨 终于来了啊
Hey, it's about time.

340
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:44,817
整早就我一个人在这里
Been out here on my own all morning.

341
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:49,689
怎么 还需要我发一张请柬吗
What, are you waiting for an invitation?

342
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:51,190
开始干活啊
Start pulling your weight.

343
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:53,926
先把问题放一放 伙计 我是NCIS
Okay, take it down a notch, buddy. NCIS.

344
00:14:55,997 --> 00:14:58,130
抱歉 我 呃
Sorry about that. I, uh...

345
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,899
我以为你是我们的志愿者呢
I thought you were one of our volunteers.

346
00:14:59,968 --> 00:15:02,401
他迟到一个半小时了
He's over an hour and a half late.

347
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,770
你是 呃 Waterway志愿者协会的成员吗
Are you with, uh, Waterway Volunteers?

348
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:06,973
呃 没错
Uh, yeah. That's right.

349
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,441
我花了一早晨的时间
I spent my morning covering

350
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,443
清理那条半英里的路
a half-mile stretch that way.

351
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:12,578
怎么回事 NCIS在这里干什么
Why? What's NCIS doing out here?

352
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:15,615
Nick 我有发现了
Nick! Got something!

353
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,557
你说过Wesley Moore开着一辆什么车来着
What kind of car did you say Wesley Moore had?

354
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:26,859
银色福特福克斯
It's a silver Ford Focus.

355
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:36,769
不错啊 Kasie
Not bad, Kasie.

356
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:38,838
谢谢
Thanks.

357
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:49,248
为什么一个像Voit上尉这样的授勋陆战队员
Why would a decorated Marine like Captain Voit get mixed up

358
00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:51,083
会跟Wesley Moore这样的人混在一起呢
with somebody like Wesley Moore?

359
00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:52,952
他们并没那么不同 Leon
Well, they're not that different, Leon.

360
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:56,656
都在十几岁成为孤儿 生长在社会福利机构里的孩子
Both were orphaned as teenagers, were children of public servants

361
00:15:56,724 --> 00:15:59,692
而且都有这种纯洁的为国效力的愿望
and shared this pure desire to serve their country.

362
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:01,661
我们说的是同一个Moore吗
Are we talking about the same Moore?

363
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:03,863
那个假扮成海军水手
The one who impersonated a Navy sailor,

364
00:16:03,932 --> 00:16:05,998
闯入设防的军事设施
who broke onto a secure military facility

365
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:08,868
黑进了机密的国防部服务器
and hacked into a confidential DoD server,

366
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:11,304
把数千美军士兵置于危险境地的那个人吗
putting thousands of U.S. troops at risk?

367
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:12,939
嗨 我没说他是完美的人
Hey, I didn't say he was perfect.

368
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:14,307
这么说就非常轻描淡写了
Well, there's an understatement.

369
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,775
但我不相信 Moore
But I don't believe that Moore

370
00:16:15,843 --> 00:16:18,444
侵入那些文件是出于邪恶的原因
accessed those files for nefarious reasons.

371
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:20,513
他确实帮了Voit
He-he did it to help Voit.

372
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:21,714
怎么帮的
Help how?

373
00:16:21,783 --> 00:16:23,015
Voit是在寻找答案
Voit was looking for answers.

374
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:24,361
没错 关于12个死掉的陆战队员的
Right. On the 12 dead Marines.

375
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:25,551
她知道Moore
She knew that Moore

376
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,462
能够黑进国防部系统
could hack into DoD's system

377
00:16:27,463 --> 00:16:29,306
还不用顾忌那些繁文缛节
and cut through the governmental red tape.

378
00:16:29,307 --> 00:16:31,053
没错 只是这非常不合法
Yeah, in a highly illegal way.

379
00:16:31,054 --> 00:16:33,218
这意味着事情非常紧迫
Which suggests a sense of urgency.

380
00:16:33,219 --> 00:16:36,604
Voit上尉找Moore求助
Now, Captain Voit reached out to Moore

381
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:39,553
而不是去找她的指挥系统 为什么呢
instead of going through her chain of command. Why?

382
00:16:39,554 --> 00:16:40,919
因为Voit不知道能够相信谁
'Cause Voit didn't know who to trust.

383
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,017
没错
Exactly.

384
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,737
你认为他们的死是有关联的吗
You think their deaths are connected?

385
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:44,738
百分百确信
100%.

386
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:46,339
他们都死在了同一天
They both died the same day--

387
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:48,407
一个死在华盛顿 一个死在阿富汗
one in D.C., one in Afghanistan.

388
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:50,142
协同攻击 对吧
Coordinated attacks, yeah?

389
00:16:50,211 --> 00:16:53,479
这一切的关键一定跟阿富汗那边有关
And the key to why has to do with Afghanistan.

390
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:55,881
一般在这个时候你就会告诉我
And this is usually the time you tell me

391
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,184
你已经派人前往阿富汗了
that you've already sent a team en route.

392
00:16:58,252 --> 00:16:59,819
今早就派遣McGee和Bishop去了
Sent McGee and Bishop this morning.

393
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:01,921
他们应该随时会到达Russell营地
They should be at Camp Russell any minute.

394
00:17:03,391 --> 00:17:06,993
别问我 我也不知道他是怎么做到的
Don't ask me. I-I don't know how he does it, either.

395
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:23,009
已经向将军汇报过情况了
The CG's been briefed on the situation.

396
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:25,544
他让全力配合
He said to assist in any way possible.

397
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:26,957
-我们能跟他谈谈吗 -他刚刚在跟
- When can we speak with him? - Well, he's finishing up

398
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:29,015
今天新到的陆战特遣小队谈话
with a new Marine detachment that arrived today.

399
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,794
我以为美军应该
Thought, uh, U.S. forces were supposed to be

400
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:32,952
-开始从阿富汗撤军了 -确实是这么计划的
- withdrawing from Afghanistan. - That was the plan.

401
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:34,598
但是塔利班的袭击一直在增加
But with the Taliban's attacks increasing

402
00:17:34,622 --> 00:17:35,933
而且他们对喀布尔的控制一直在巩固
and their grip on Kabul strengthening,

403
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:37,456
撤军行动已经被推迟了
the withdrawal's been put on hold.

404
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:39,358
所依你跟Aazar Atwa很熟是吗
So you're familiar with Aazar Atwa?

405
00:17:39,427 --> 00:17:41,293
是的 女士 大概没有陆战队员
Yes, ma'am. You'd be hard-pressed to find

406
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:42,695
跟他不熟
a Marine here who isn't.

407
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:44,697
他害死了很多我们的人
We've lost a lot of good people because of him.

408
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:47,099
Voit上尉只是最近的伤亡
Captain Voit was just the most recent casualty.

409
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:50,536
你可以说Atwa是这里的头号公敌
You could say Atwa is public enemy number one around here.

410
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:52,238
Bishop和McGee探员
Agents Bishop and McGee.

411
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:55,207
我是Braxton将军 Russell营地的指挥官
Russell的I'm General Braxton, CG of Camp Russell.

412
00:17:55,276 --> 00:17:57,021
-非常感谢您的协助 将军 -当然
- Appreciate the assistance, General. - Of course.

413
00:17:57,045 --> 00:17:58,644
Voit上尉是我们自己人
Captain Voit was one of our own.

414
00:17:58,713 --> 00:18:00,479
我们希望能给她伸张正义
We want her to have justice.

415
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:03,282
看来你们来得正是时候 刚好可以目睹我们伸张正义
And it looks like you both have arrived just in time to see it.

416
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:04,483
这怎么说
How's that?

417
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:06,052
我从我们的巡逻队得到消息
I received word from our patrol

418
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,965
他们在东北扇区发现了一个疑似塔利班安全屋
in the northeast sector who were conducting a raid

419
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:09,989
并进行了突袭
of a suspected Taliban safe house.

420
00:18:10,058 --> 00:18:12,391
-他们找到武器藏匿地点了吗 -比这更好
- Did they find the weapons cache? - Better.

421
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,994
他们找到了Aazar Atwa
They found Aazar Atwa.

422
00:18:15,063 --> 00:18:16,495
Atwa现在在哪呢
Wh-Where's Atwa now?

423
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:18,831
正在返回我们基地的路上 有重兵把守
En route back to our base, under heavy guard.

424
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,301
你们对Voit上尉的死有疑问吗
You have questions about Captain Voit's death?

425
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,290
你们很快就有机会面对面地询问
You'll soon get the chance to question her killer

426
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:25,504
杀害她的凶手了
face-to-face.

427
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:43,776
你确定不需要我做什么吗 上校
Are you sure there's nothing I can get for you, Colonel?

428
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:46,312
不 谢谢你 我很好
No. Thank you. I'm fine.

429
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,015
你是否介意我问一下 呃 包里是什么
Do you mind me asking what's, uh... what's in the bag?

430
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:53,552
Voit上尉的私人物品
Contains Captain Voit's personal effects.

431
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:56,355
啊 是啊 我忍不住注意到
Ah. Yeah, I couldn't help but notice that...

432
00:18:56,424 --> 00:18:58,958
你一分一秒都不让它离开你的视线
you won't let it out of your sight, even for a second.

433
00:18:59,026 --> 00:19:00,793
根据国防部规定
Per DoD regulations,

434
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:03,028
逝去军人的私人物品
a fallen service member's personal effects

435
00:19:03,097 --> 00:19:05,898
应当全程由护送者守护
shall remain in the escort's possession at all times

436
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:08,634
直到送达亲人手中
until directly delivered to the next of kin.

437
00:19:08,703 --> 00:19:10,903
嗯
Mm-hmm.

438
00:19:10,972 --> 00:19:14,006
要知道 对陆战队员而言 我想不出
You know, I can't imagine a more difficult detail for a Marine

439
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:18,811
会有比护送逝去的兄弟姐妹回家 更难受的任务了
to be assigned than escorting a fallen brother or sister home.

440
00:19:20,715 --> 00:19:23,749
我想你们的工作跟这相比也没什么不同 医生
I suspect your job is not much different, Doctor.

441
00:19:23,818 --> 00:19:28,554
是啊 会有...有时会有一些内心的挣扎
Yeah. It's a, uh... it's a struggle at times.

442
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:30,556
但是当我知道我们在帮忙提供一些结论
But I take comfort in knowing that we're helping

443
00:19:30,624 --> 00:19:32,324
这会让我内心舒服一些
to provide with some closure.

444
00:19:33,394 --> 00:19:35,394
我内心舒适与否无关紧要
My comfort is inconsequential.

445
00:19:36,731 --> 00:19:38,075
那些为国家
Those that make the ultimate sacrifice

446
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:39,398
牺牲一切的人
for this country

447
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:41,333
理应载着荣誉返回家中
deserve to be brought home with honor.

448
00:19:43,137 --> 00:19:45,237
Duck 有什么发现
Duck, what do we know?

449
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:47,239
Voit上尉的检查
An examination of Captain Voit

450
00:19:47,308 --> 00:19:49,441
没有什么结果
could not be performed since

451
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,044
因为要举行葬礼 她的尸体被处理过了
she has already been processed for burial.

452
00:19:52,113 --> 00:19:55,280
但是Kabul和Dover的记录
But the records from Kabul and Dover

453
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:56,849
十分详细
are very thorough.

454
00:19:56,917 --> 00:20:00,085
上尉先被两颗子弹击中胸部
The captain was first struck with two bullets to the chest.

455
00:20:00,154 --> 00:20:01,887
尽管她严重受伤
Uh, despite her grave condition,

456
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:04,456
但在第三次致命的头部打击前
she managed to take out four insurgents

457
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:07,960
她成功地击败四名恐怖分子
before the third and fatal blow to the head.

458
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:09,094
她从没放弃
She never gave up.

459
00:20:09,163 --> 00:20:11,430
这就是陆战队员
That's a Marine.

460
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:14,967
好了 够了
Okay. We are done here.

461
00:20:15,036 --> 00:20:16,969
-上校 -我遵守了你的要求
- Colonel? - I complied with your request,

462
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,205
Gibbs探员 我同意你将Voit上尉带到这里来
Agent Gibbs. I allowed you to bring Captain Voit here,

463
00:20:20,274 --> 00:20:21,974
来反驳我的判断
against my better judgment.

464
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:24,443
你的法医刚才说
As your doctors have just pointed out,

465
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:26,378
她对你们来说已经没有用了
she is of no further use to you.

466
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:28,781
把她的遗物给我 让我
Release her remains, and allow me

467
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:30,482
完成我的任务
to finish my mission.

468
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:32,317
证物还在处理中
Evidence is still being processed.

469
00:20:32,386 --> 00:20:33,919
调查还没结束
Our investigation isn't over.

470
00:20:33,988 --> 00:20:35,954
但我的合作结束了
But my cooperation is.

471
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:38,657
你们两位单独谈谈吧
W-We'll give you two a moment.

472
00:20:43,731 --> 00:20:45,664
-这是什么 -备忘录
- What's this? - A memo,

473
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:47,399
来自于国防部长
from the Secretary of Defense,

474
00:20:47,468 --> 00:20:49,268
以确保你的配合
ensuring your full cooperation.

475
00:20:49,336 --> 00:20:51,270
解释下为什么上尉在阿富汗的时候
Explain to me how the captain can be involved

476
00:20:51,338 --> 00:20:54,006
会卷入一场美国的谋杀案
in a murder in the States when she was in Afghanistan.

477
00:20:54,075 --> 00:20:55,908
这说不通
This makes no sense.

478
00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:57,709
我在尽我的职责
I'm doing my job!

479
00:20:59,313 --> 00:21:01,346
我以为你是名陆战队员 Gibbs
I thought you were a Marine, Gibbs.

480
00:21:01,415 --> 00:21:05,117
你若是 就把她送回去
If you were, you'd have her back.

481
00:21:05,186 --> 00:21:09,188
她的葬礼将在36小时后举行
Her burial is in 36 hours.

482
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:11,056
我会把她送到那里的
I will get her there.

483
00:21:29,677 --> 00:21:31,210
嘿 Kasie
Hey, Kasie.

484
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:32,511
怎么样
How you doing?

485
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,180
情绪范围一到十吗
On a scale of one to ten?

486
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:36,281
是负数
We're in the negatives.

487
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,350
-哇 -你说说
- Whoa. - Yeah, tell me about it.

488
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:41,153
我想成为名外勤特工 结果却被咬了
I tried being a field agent, and it bit me.

489
00:21:41,222 --> 00:21:42,488
你看看
Look at me.

490
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:44,523
就像个连接点图
It's like a connect-the-dots sheet.

491
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:48,393
我没在笑
I'm not really laughing.

492
00:21:48,462 --> 00:21:50,462
好吧 既然工作是少有的几件能让我
Okay, well, since work is one of the only things

493
00:21:50,531 --> 00:21:52,564
忘记痒的事
distracting me from the urge to itch,

494
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:54,466
我要开始了
I'm just gonna jump right in.

495
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:57,402
我在Wesley Moore的车上没有发现任何有用的指纹
I didn't find any usable prints in Wesley Moore's car,

496
00:21:57,471 --> 00:22:00,405
但我在损坏的后车身上有发现
but I hit the jackpot with the rear body damage.

497
00:22:00,474 --> 00:22:02,341
看下这个
Check this out.

498
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:04,343
这是Moore在他被杀的那晚
This is a surveillance image

499
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:06,311
离开国防后勤局的
of Moore leaving the DLA

500
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,460
监控录像 注意到了什么吗
on the night that he was killed. You notice anything?

501
00:22:11,652 --> 00:22:14,219
-尾灯和挡板完好无损 -对
- Taillight and fender are intact. - Yeah.

502
00:22:14,288 --> 00:22:16,755
说明这辆车是在他死前那晚的
Meaning this vehicle was damaged later that night,

503
00:22:16,824 --> 00:22:18,490
晚些时候损坏的
before he was killed.

504
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,570
所以 如果他被盯上了 凶手一定
So, if he was being tailed, the killer must have, uh,

505
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:23,162
撞上挡板让Moore下车
caused a fender bender to get Moore out of the car.

506
00:22:24,598 --> 00:22:25,998
所以我得到了第二份油漆的信息
So I pulled a second paint profile

507
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:28,200
是刚说的凶手的车 哇
of the killer's car in question. Whoo!

508
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:30,836
想试着五倍速说完
Try saying that five times fast.

509
00:22:30,905 --> 00:22:34,273
是有金属底漆的红漆
And it is a lacquer-based red with a metallic base coat.

510
00:22:34,341 --> 00:22:36,241
符合这样的车数不过来
Okay, hundreds of cars match that.

511
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,410
实际上 因为它是生产中最常用的
Actually, since it's one of the most used

512
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:40,345
油漆类型之一
paint types in production,

513
00:22:40,414 --> 00:22:42,714
数量就更加多了
the number's more in the thousands.

514
00:22:42,783 --> 00:22:44,394
你看我们该怎么缩小嫌犯范围
How do you suggest we narrow down our suspects?

515
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:46,685
靠坚持不懈的努力 聪明才智
Well, with, uh, persistence, diligence,

516
00:22:46,754 --> 00:22:48,387
结合电脑技术
and our combined computer skills.

517
00:22:48,455 --> 00:22:52,191
结合吗 我吗 Bishop 还是McGee
Combined? What am I, Bishop or McGee?

518
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:53,458
不可能 我就是个
No, I'm more of, like,

519
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:55,127
运动份子
a physical specimen, man, you know?

520
00:22:55,196 --> 00:22:56,528
打架 恐吓别人
You know, punching, intimidating,

521
00:22:56,597 --> 00:22:58,197
-才是符合我做的事 -好吧
- that's more my thing. - Mm, okay.

522
00:22:58,265 --> 00:23:01,633
我替你穿过了那片沼泽 Nicholas
I trekked through a swamp for you, Nicholas.

523
00:23:01,702 --> 00:23:04,636
所以 你要是不替我担保 就会在
So, if you bail on me now, you're just gonna find

524
00:23:04,705 --> 00:23:07,940
办公桌抽屉里发现会动的铜头蛇
a slithering copperhead snake in your desk drawer.

525
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:10,309
或者在你的床上
Ooh, or in your bed.

526
00:23:11,545 --> 00:23:13,478
或者更糟
Or worse.

527
00:23:16,217 --> 00:23:18,650
只有我
Is it just me,

528
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:21,119
-感觉到 -太过容易了吗
- or does this feel... - Too easy?

529
00:23:21,188 --> 00:23:22,621
不仅是你有这种感觉
No, it's not just you.

530
00:23:29,396 --> 00:23:32,831
作为被捕的恐怖分子他看上去很自在
He looks pretty carefree for a captured terrorist.

531
00:23:35,302 --> 00:23:36,435
你来翻译吗
You gonna translate?

532
00:23:36,503 --> 00:23:39,504
不 我不需要
No. I don't need to,

533
00:23:39,573 --> 00:23:41,673
因为他能听得懂
'cause he can understand us just fine.

534
00:23:41,742 --> 00:23:43,342
是吗
Isn't that right?

535
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,577
是的 我能听懂
Yes, I can.

536
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:49,581
不好意思 什么东西逗乐你了吗
Sorry, does something amuse you?

537
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,850
所有的这些
This. All of it.

538
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,119
给你看看我不觉得有趣的东西
Well, let me show you what I don't find funny.

539
00:23:54,188 --> 00:23:55,487
Alicia Voit
Alicia Voit,

540
00:23:55,556 --> 00:23:58,624
Max Wiezman
Max Wiezman,

541
00:23:58,692 --> 00:24:00,759
Anna Gutierrez
Anna Gutierrez,

542
00:24:00,828 --> 00:24:03,996
Tyson Eccles和Nolan Takahamo
Tyson Eccles, Nolan Takahamo.

543
00:24:04,064 --> 00:24:05,163
还要继续吗
Should I continue?

544
00:24:05,232 --> 00:24:07,043
-这些名字对我来说没什么意义 -它们应该有
- Those names mean nothing to me. - Well, they should.

545
00:24:07,067 --> 00:24:09,107
这些是你杀死的陆战队员的名字
They're the names of some of the Marines you killed.

546
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,404
再说一遍
Again...

547
00:24:13,774 --> 00:24:15,140
它们对我来说没有什么意义
...they mean nothing to me.

548
00:24:15,209 --> 00:24:16,975
所以你不否认你杀了他们
So you don't deny it?

549
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:18,477
为什么要否认值得我骄傲的事呢
Why deny what I'm proud of?

550
00:24:18,545 --> 00:24:22,547
要是你这么骄傲 跟我们说一下她
Well, if you're so proud, tell us about her.

551
00:24:22,616 --> 00:24:24,816
她是上周你袭击的运输队成员之一
She was part of the convoy you hit last week.

552
00:24:24,885 --> 00:24:26,318
我记得
I remember.

553
00:24:26,387 --> 00:24:28,620
那天天气晴朗
The sky was so clear that day.

554
00:24:28,689 --> 00:24:31,390
我们从很远就能看到他们的车子
We could see their vehicle from miles away,

555
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:33,325
她真是不幸
unfortunately for her.

556
00:24:33,394 --> 00:24:35,193
那也不容易吧
Wasn't that easy.

557
00:24:35,262 --> 00:24:36,828
Voit上尉杀了你的四个手下
Captain Voit killed four of your men

558
00:24:36,897 --> 00:24:38,297
在你杀死她前
before you could finish her off.

559
00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:40,132
我猜你低估了她
Guess you underestimated her.

560
00:24:41,535 --> 00:24:44,069
我们要继续这场游戏吗
Are we going to continue this game,

561
00:24:44,138 --> 00:24:47,039
还是想知道我袭击的真相
or do you want to know the truth about my attacks?

562
00:24:47,107 --> 00:24:49,708
告诉我们
Tell us.

563
00:24:52,112 --> 00:24:54,546
你们要给我想要的
Only if I get something in return.

564
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:57,182
自由
My freedom.

565
00:24:57,251 --> 00:24:58,717
真新奇
How original.

566
00:24:58,786 --> 00:25:01,653
你是个恐怖分子 杀了13名陆战队员
You're a terrorist who killed 13 U.S. Marines.

567
00:25:01,722 --> 00:25:03,055
希望你能好好享受镣铐
Hope you enjoy those shackles,

568
00:25:03,123 --> 00:25:04,723
因为你要在监狱里
'cause you're gonna be living in a cell

569
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:07,392
度过余生了 我们走
for the rest of your life. Let's go.

570
00:25:10,898 --> 00:25:12,998
我从一个美国人那里
I had help,

571
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:14,733
得到了帮助
from an American.

572
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:19,671
引起你们的注意了吗
Now do I have your attention?

573
00:25:27,247 --> 00:25:30,082
你和美国人一起合作吗
You were working with an American?

574
00:25:31,285 --> 00:25:32,285
证明下
Prove it.

575
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,786
用我的自由来换
My freedom for a traitor

576
00:25:34,855 --> 00:25:37,389
背叛国家的叛徒
who's been betraying your country.

577
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:39,891
一场公平的交易
Fair trade,

578
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,361
不觉得吗
don't you think?

579
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,898
Atwa疯了
Atwa's out of his damn mind.

580
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:49,568
美国政府不会和恐怖分子做交易
The U.S. government will not d a deal with a known terrorist.

581
00:25:49,636 --> 00:25:52,371
我明白 主任 但是Atwa说
I understand, Director, but Atwa claims

582
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:54,317
他一直在和一个内部的美国人合作
he's been working with an American on the inside.

583
00:25:54,341 --> 00:25:55,474
Atwa很聪明
Atwa's smart.

584
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:57,142
他会说出我们想要听到的东西
He'll say whatever we want to hear

585
00:25:57,211 --> 00:25:58,777
只要能确保他被释放
if it means securing his release.

586
00:25:58,846 --> 00:26:01,580
我们不能保证他给我们的是真的
We have no guarantee what he gives us is the truth.

587
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:04,116
通常来说 Sloane 我会同意你说的
Yes, and normally, Sloane, I would agree with you,

588
00:26:04,184 --> 00:26:07,452
但这次我不同意 我觉得他不像在说谎
but not this time. I-I really don't think he's bluffing.

589
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:08,754
Bishop 发现了些什么
Bishop, what do you know?

590
00:26:08,822 --> 00:26:11,123
我以前也面对过像Atwa这样的恐怖分子
Look, I-I've dealt with insurgents like Atwa before.

591
00:26:11,191 --> 00:26:13,959
他不焦虑 紧张 反复无常
He-he's not agitated, nervous or volatile.

592
00:26:14,027 --> 00:26:15,894
实际上 他很自信
He is, in fact, assured,

593
00:26:15,963 --> 00:26:18,430
就像是知道自己的优势
like someone who knows that they have the advantage.

594
00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:20,265
那12个死去了的陆战队员呢
12 dead Marines.

595
00:26:20,334 --> 00:26:21,633
他们怎么了
What about them?

596
00:26:21,702 --> 00:26:23,402
塔利班袭击了运输队
Transports were hit by the Taliban.

597
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,837
在最后时刻运输路线改变了
Convoy routes are changed at the last minute.

598
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:27,072
是的
Yeah.

599
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:28,351
一定有人把他们的行动
Someone had to be directly relaying

600
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:29,641
直接告诉了Atwa
their movements to Atwa.

601
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,943
即使是真的 也无法抹去
Well, even if that's true, it doesn't erase the fact

602
00:26:32,012 --> 00:26:35,180
Atwa杀死那些队员的事实
that Atwa's caused the deaths of multiple troops.

603
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:36,648
Leon 他想要对话
He wants to talk, Leon.

604
00:26:36,717 --> 00:26:39,618
那就让他说 但不会有交易的
Well, then get him to talk, but he's not getting a deal.

605
00:26:39,686 --> 00:26:41,453
明白了吗
Is that clear?

606
00:26:41,522 --> 00:26:43,989
明白了 主任
Uh, yes, yes, Director.

607
00:26:44,057 --> 00:26:45,690
Gibbs
Gibbs?

608
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,726
他的朋友不需要知道
His friends don't need to know that.

609
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,766
上校 太晚了
Colonel, it's late.

610
00:26:54,835 --> 00:26:57,669
在宿舍给你准备了个房间
Got a room waiting for you at the BOQ.

611
00:26:57,738 --> 00:27:00,105
这没必要 我很好
That won't be necessary. I'm doing fine.

612
00:27:00,174 --> 00:27:01,940
国防部护送人员可以
DoD escorts are permitted

613
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:05,277
将遗体留在
to leave service members' remains

614
00:27:05,345 --> 00:27:07,112
安全的地方
at a secure location.

615
00:27:07,181 --> 00:27:09,314
我知道规章
I know what the regulations say.

616
00:27:09,383 --> 00:27:12,484
我只是觉得只留下上尉一个人在这里不好
I just don't feel right leaving the captain alone.

617
00:27:12,553 --> 00:27:15,086
知道你会这么说
Yeah, figured you were gonna say something like that.

618
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,127
你在做什么
What are you doing?

619
00:27:23,964 --> 00:27:25,630
给你搭张床
I'm getting you a cot.

620
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:28,533
-我说了 我很好 -我知道 你很好
- I told you, I'm fine. - Yeah, yeah, I know, you're fine.

621
00:27:28,602 --> 00:27:30,335
我明白
I got it, okay.

622
00:27:30,404 --> 00:27:32,070
你得睡觉
Got to sleep somewhere.

623
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:34,005
要么这里 要么离开
Hey, take it or leave it.

624
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:36,274
你决定
Your call.

625
00:27:45,219 --> 00:27:46,918
我为之前说过的话
I owe you an apology

626
00:27:46,987 --> 00:27:48,887
道歉 Gibbs
for what I said earlier, Gibbs.

627
00:27:50,123 --> 00:27:52,891
我不该质疑你的忠诚
It was wrong to question your service.

628
00:27:54,928 --> 00:27:56,394
我去过那里 上校
I've been there, Colonel.

629
00:27:56,463 --> 00:28:01,066
分配到护送任务
It is not easy

630
00:28:01,134 --> 00:28:03,768
很不容易
getting assigned an escort detail.

631
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:07,439
是啊
No.

632
00:28:07,508 --> 00:28:09,140
不容易
No, it's not.

633
00:28:11,645 --> 00:28:14,145
要是你是自愿的就更加艰难了
It's even harder if you volunteered for it.

634
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:18,016
那么明显吗
Was it that obvious?

635
00:28:22,356 --> 00:28:24,222
你怎么认识Voit上尉的
How'd you know Captain Voit?

636
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:27,926
是我招募了她
I was the one who recruited her.

637
00:28:27,995 --> 00:28:32,397
十年前我遇到了Voit
Met Voit ten years ago.

638
00:28:32,466 --> 00:28:35,133
在前一个冬天她失去了双亲
She had just lost both of her parents the winter before.

639
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:36,968
她正在上大学
She was putting herself through college.

640
00:28:37,037 --> 00:28:40,639
工作认真 头脑聪明
She was a real hard worker, and good head on her shoulders.

641
00:28:40,707 --> 00:28:43,074
是块做陆战队的料
Marine material.

642
00:28:43,143 --> 00:28:45,310
我可以在
I can always tell within a...

643
00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:46,978
在见到别人的一分钟内
within a minute of meeting somebody

644
00:28:47,047 --> 00:28:50,248
分辨出有没有做陆战队员的潜质
whether they have what it takes.

645
00:28:50,317 --> 00:28:51,650
Voit具有这种潜质
Voit did.

646
00:28:53,654 --> 00:28:56,555
我让她
I was the one

647
00:28:56,623 --> 00:28:59,424
加入军队
who swore her in,

648
00:28:59,493 --> 00:29:04,062
所以也应该带她回家
so I should be the one to bring her home,

649
00:29:04,131 --> 00:29:07,899
就像我为其他人死去的队员
just like I did for all the other

650
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:11,069
做的一样
fallen Marines that I've recruited.

651
00:29:13,073 --> 00:29:14,439
有多少
How many?

652
00:29:14,508 --> 00:29:16,908
一个就已经够多的了
One is too many.

653
00:29:16,977 --> 00:29:21,212
上校 他们的死不是你的责任
You're not responsible for their deaths, Colonel.


654
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:25,917
你也失去过战友 对吗
You've lost people, right?

655
00:29:25,986 --> 00:29:27,919
在陆战队的时候
As a Marine,

656
00:29:27,988 --> 00:29:29,988
当探员的时候
as an agent?

657
00:29:31,858 --> 00:29:34,259
你觉得你没有责任吗
Did you not feel responsible?

658
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:42,767
他们只是 只是孩子
They were just... just kids who...

659
00:29:42,836 --> 00:29:46,371
在我的引导下参了军
joined the military under my guidance.

660
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:51,710
我每天都想着
I'll carry their deaths with me

661
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:53,778
他们的死亡
every day.

662
00:29:57,084 --> 00:29:59,117
我欠他们太多了
I owe them that much.

663
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:06,291
-我们要去哪里 -把你转移
- Where are we going? - Transferring you.

664
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,159
到关塔那摩 在古巴
To Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

665
00:30:08,228 --> 00:30:10,528
希望你会喜欢那里的潮湿和孤独
Hope you like humidity and solitary.

666
00:30:10,597 --> 00:30:12,631
这是在恐吓我吗
Is that supposed to frighten me?

667
00:30:12,699 --> 00:30:14,899
不是 但把你和Gibbs关在一起就是了
No, but putting you in a cell with Gibbs may.

668
00:30:14,968 --> 00:30:16,134
最后的机会 Atwa
Last chance, Atwa.

669
00:30:16,203 --> 00:30:17,836
告诉我们和你合作的美国人是谁
Tell us the American you're working with.

670
00:30:17,904 --> 00:30:20,238
-除非把我放了 -你得好好想想
- Not until I'm released. - May want to rethink that.

671
00:30:20,307 --> 00:30:22,218
我想你的同伴看到你和我们合作
I can't imagine your fellow insurgents would look favorably

672
00:30:22,242 --> 00:30:24,042
可不会开心
on you working with us.

673
00:30:24,111 --> 00:30:27,746
他们才不关心一个美国人的命运
The fate of an American isn't their concern.

674
00:30:27,814 --> 00:30:29,748
他们知道我不会背叛他们
They know I would never betray them.

675
00:30:29,816 --> 00:30:31,549
除非我们在城里散播消息
Well, unless we spread word around town

676
00:30:31,618 --> 00:30:33,485
说你为了自由背叛了他们
that you gave them up for your freedom.

677
00:30:33,553 --> 00:30:34,919
我们可以令人信服
We can be very convincing.

678
00:30:34,988 --> 00:30:37,489
他们会认为你是个叛徒和麻烦
They'll see you as a traitor and a liability.

679
00:30:37,557 --> 00:30:39,891
没有完美的保护
You won't last one minute outside those gates,

680
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,359
你走出监狱活不过一分钟
not without our protection.

681
00:30:41,428 --> 00:30:42,861
所以 你要是想活着
So, if you enjoy breathing,

682
00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:44,062
我建议你
I suggest you start talking

683
00:30:44,131 --> 00:30:45,964
告诉我们那个美国联络人是谁
and tell us who your American contact is.

684
00:30:47,134 --> 00:30:49,567
很好
Very well.

685
00:30:49,636 --> 00:30:53,338
12个月前 我从线人那里收到情报
12 months ago, I began receiving intelligence from a source.

686
00:31:08,363 --> 00:31:10,564
发生了什么 McGee
What the hell happened, McGee?

687
00:31:10,632 --> 00:31:11,998
狙击手从山上开的枪
Sniper fire from the mountains.

688
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,983
没有人看到凶手
No one had eyes on the shooter.

689
00:31:14,052 --> 00:31:15,484
Atwa告诉了你什么吗
Did Atwa give you anything?

690
00:31:15,553 --> 00:31:17,486
他刚要说 就被中枪了
He was about to when the gunfire started.

691
00:31:17,555 --> 00:31:19,455
有人想要他闭嘴
Well, someone wanted to shut him up.

692
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:20,834
这说明我们中有内奸
Which means we got a mole on our hands

693
00:31:20,858 --> 00:31:21,791
他受过狙击训练
with advanced sniper training.

694
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:23,092
太好了
That's perfect.

695
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:25,561
转移Atwa的消息没有流出过Russell营地
The details of Atwa's transfer never left Camp Russell.

696
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,763
那一定是营内的人
So it had to be someone in-house.

697
00:31:27,832 --> 00:31:29,832
Bishop正在查看所有人员的个人档案
Bishop's going through all the personnel files now.

698
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:32,468
听着 McGee 给我找到他
Listen to me, McGee, you find him!

699
00:31:44,482 --> 00:31:47,583
我没法再盯着屏幕了
I'm not sure I can stare at this screen much longer.

700
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:49,986
这光让我不停地眯眼
This glare is making me squint,

701
00:31:50,054 --> 00:31:52,855
这张脸不会长皱纹
and this face doesn't do wrinkles.

702
00:31:52,924 --> 00:31:54,423
加油 大家
Come on, team.

703
00:31:54,492 --> 00:31:55,925
即便我们通宵
Sure, we pulled an all-nighter

704
00:31:55,994 --> 00:31:57,805
查交通监控 也没找到
combing traffic-cam footage, and we're no closer

705
00:31:57,829 --> 00:32:01,264
嫌疑人 但我们在一起奋斗 不是吗
to finding our suspect, but we're in this together, right?

706
00:32:01,332 --> 00:32:03,933
-朋友互相帮忙 -Jimmy
- Friends helping friends. - Jimmy,

707
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:05,167
闭嘴
stop talking.

708
00:32:05,236 --> 00:32:08,004
嘿 Jimmy
Hey, Jimmy.

709
00:32:08,072 --> 00:32:09,705
你什么时候来的
When'd you get here?

710
00:32:09,774 --> 00:32:11,807
哦 天啊
Oh, boy.

711
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:14,377
早上好
The top o' the morning to you.

712
00:32:14,445 --> 00:32:18,047
我给你们带了急需的食物
I bring much-needed sustenance.

713
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:20,716
两杯黑咖啡
Two black coffees.

714
00:32:20,785 --> 00:32:22,885
给
There we are. And, uh,

715
00:32:22,954 --> 00:32:25,788
还有一杯大杯双份冰摩卡
one large double mocha

716
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:28,224
加了混合奶油
frozen blend with whipping cream

717
00:32:28,293 --> 00:32:32,528
巧克力片和焦糖
and chocolate chips, and a drizzle of caramel.

718
00:32:32,597 --> 00:32:35,131
太棒了
Yes. Mm.

719
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:38,367
这个直击我心
Now, that hits the spot.

720
00:32:38,436 --> 00:32:40,603
你这么吃还长这样吗
You can eat that and still look like that?

721
00:32:42,106 --> 00:32:44,173
天啊 生活真是不公平
Man, life's not fair.

722
00:32:44,242 --> 00:32:46,208
Jimmy 你让我反感了
Jimmy, uh, you disgust me.

723
00:32:46,277 --> 00:32:49,045
嘿 有发现
Hey... got something.

724
00:32:49,113 --> 00:32:51,914
红色卡车符合我们的描述
Red truck matching our description.

725
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:54,417
保险杠也损坏了
Ooh, complete with front bumper damage.

726
00:32:54,485 --> 00:32:55,685
这是在哪里拍到的
Where was this picture taken?

727
00:32:55,753 --> 00:32:57,720
摄像头 在Moore被杀的那晚
Traffic cam, ten miles from where

728
00:32:57,789 --> 00:32:59,322
距离发现他车的地方
Moore's car was found

729
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,923
十英里处
on the night he was killed.

730
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:02,491
这辆卡车登记在谁的名下
Who's the truck registered to?

731
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,694
Xavier Blackburn
Xavier Blackburn.

732
00:33:04,762 --> 00:33:06,395
来自Falls Church的市民
Civilian from Falls Church.

733
00:33:06,464 --> 00:33:08,564
我在沼泽地里遇到过这家伙
Hey, I ran into this guy at the marsh.

734
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:11,067
他说他是和水路志愿者一起的
He said he was with Waterway Volunteers.

735
00:33:11,135 --> 00:33:13,936
Xavier Blackburn不在他们的成员名单上
Uh, there's no Xavier Blackburn listed on their crew roster.

736
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:15,938
那么他在沼泽地里做什么
Then what was he doing at the marsh?

737
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:17,973
和所有犯了罪的人做同样的事
Doing what all guilty people do.

738
00:33:19,444 --> 00:33:21,677
掩盖行迹
Covering his tracks.

739
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,510
你看我说得对不对
So, let me see if I got this right.

740
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,750
用自己的时间做志愿服务 却成为了谋杀嫌犯吗
Volunteering my time makes me a murder suspect?

741
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,380
真不愧是好人难做啊
Talk about "no good deed."

742
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,920
但是Waterway志愿服务队里
Okay, so no one at Waterway Volunteers

743
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,090
没人听说过你
has ever heard of you.

744
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,460
我是新人 他们一定搞丢了我的文件
I'm new. They must have lost my paperwork.

745
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,930
我们没丢
We didn't.

746
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,030
Xavier Blackburn 33岁
"Xavier Blackburn, 33."

747
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,960
给阿灵顿一个私人军事公司
Spent six years as a contractor

748
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,970
当了六年的承包商
for a private military firm in Arlington.

749
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,400
直到你因为行为问题
Until you were fired

750
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,370
被开除
because of behavioral issues.

751
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,040
愈演愈烈的暴力行为
"Increasingly violent outbursts

752
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,870
和公然无视协议
and blatant disregard for protocol."

753
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,540
我偶尔会跟一些目光短浅的上级
I had an occasional disagreement

754
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,910
有一些意见分歧
with a few short-sighted superiors.

755
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,510
我想你能理解
I'm sure you can relate.

756
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,380
不错的货车
Nice truck.

757
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:09,950
至少曾经不错 我们追查它
At least it was. We... we tracked it down

758
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,260
查到你家附近一个汽车修理厂
to a body shop near your house.

759
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,620
你猜怎样
And guess what.

760
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,460
你保险杠上的漆跟Wesley Moore的车相符
The paint on your bumper was a match to Wesley Moore's car.

761
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,300
Moore盗窃美国情报
Moore stole U.S. intelligence.

762
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:21,770
你们知道这个吗
Did you know that?

763
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,100
他对国家安全是个威胁
He was a risk to national security

764
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,470
需要被阻止
and needed to be stopped.

765
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,140
Moore是在调查一起
Moore was investigating an American

766
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,970
美国人协助塔利班的事件
who was aiding the Taliban.

767
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,980
他不是叛徒 人才
He wasn't the traitor, genius.

768
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:37,110
不 你们错了 他告诉我Moore很危险
No, you're wrong. He told me Moore was dangerous.

769
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,620
他
He?

770
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,020
他说如果我消除这个威胁
He said that if I neutralized the threat,

771
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:44,020
他就会重新雇佣我 我就能拿回我的工作了
he would reinstate me, and I would get my job back.

772
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,990
谁给你下的指示
Who gave you the order?

773
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,130
巡逻队在5点出发
The patrol will leave at 0500 hours.

774
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,600
Jennings 你开头车
Jennings, you're driving lead.

775
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,100
Dunne和Falconio 你们在侧翼
Dunne and Falconio, you're on the flank.

776
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,000
-Kinneman -在
- Kinneman. - Yeah.

777
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,670
眼睛盯紧叛军活动
Keep your eyes peeled for insurgent activity.

778
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,870
Atwa之死的谣言毫无疑问
Rumors of Atwa's death are no doubt

779
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,020
正在全城流传
circulating throughout the city,

780
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,110
所以肯定会有报复行为
so retribution is expected.

781
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,940
这你倒是说对了
You're right about that.

782
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,680
我很抱歉 探员们 但是这是一次安全简报
I'm sorry, Agents, but this is a secure briefing.

783
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,220
太晚了 将军
It's too late for that, General.

784
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,830
你的巡逻路线已经被破坏了
Your patrol route's already been compromised,

785
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,290
而且不是我们破坏的
and not by us.

786
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,360
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

787
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,820
继续啊 告诉他们
Go ahead, tell 'em.

788
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:20,690
我不知道你们什么意思
I don't know what you mean.

789
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,900
好吧 我给你个提示
All right, I'll give you a hint.

790
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,240
一个词 第一个字是 叛
One word, begins with the letter "T."

791
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,360
第二个字是 国
Rhymes with "reason."

792
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,570
最好有人马上解释一下这一切
Well, someone better start making sense real soon.

793
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,330
这位Kinneman把你们的运输路线
Kinneman here was leaking your transport routes

794
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,770
泄露给了Aazar Atwa
to Aazar Atwa.

795
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,240
他们在撒谎
That's a lie.

796
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,740
真的吗 好吧
Really? All right.

797
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,540
这人看起来眼熟吗
Does this guy look familiar?

798
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,680
你的前同事和共犯
Your former coworker and accomplice,

799
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,250
Xavier Blackburn
Xavier Blackburn?

800
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,520
他正被NCIS拘留
He's in NCIS custody.

801
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,820
以破纪录的时间就把你供出来了
Gave you up in record time.

802
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,390
别...别听他们的
Do... do not listen to them.

803
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,520
这是个圈套
This is a setup.

804
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,090
Kinneman是个军事承包商
Kinneman's a military contractor.

805
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,360
他为什么要帮塔利班呢
Why would he be helping the Taliban?

806
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,430
简单的经济学
Simple economics.

807
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,100
美军从喀布尔撤军
U.S. forces pull out of Kabul,

808
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,830
他得以从中谋利的国防合同也就消失了
的his lucrative defense contracts disappear.

809
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,870
如果这个区域的敌军袭击增加
If enemy attacks increase in the area,

810
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,700
美军就会加强部署
U.S. military strengthens their presence,

811
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,070
你的资金也就得到了保障
securing your funding.

812
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,370
所以你开始给Atwa传递
So you started passing Intel to Atwa

813
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,440
可以用来袭击那几个车队的情报
on certain convoys to attack.

814
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,220
但是Voit上尉开始打探信息
But Captain Voit started digging around,

815
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,580
而你必须终结这件事
and you had to put an end to it.

816
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,580
所以你让Atwa袭击Voit的车队
Then you had Atwa strike Voit's convoy.

817
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,980
然后你在Atwa供出你之前射杀了他
Then you shot Atwa before he could give you up.

818
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,250
对于一个受过高等狙击训练的人
Easy target for someone

819
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,850
比如你而言 这个目标太简单了
with advanced sniper training, such as yourself.

820
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,390
得了 Kinneman
Come on, Kinneman,

821
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,020
这些人理应知道的
these guys deserve to know.

822
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:28,690
那些陆战队员的性命值多少钱呢
How much were those Marines' lives worth, huh?

823
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,760
五百万吗 还是一千万
Five million? Ten?

824
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:37,770
这跟钱无关
It wasn't about money.

825
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,350
你开玩笑吗 如果军队撤出
Are you kidding me?! If the military withdraws

826
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,770
塔利班再次控制这片区域
and the Taliban takes control of this area again,

827
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,410
那我们过去15年里打的仗都是为了什么
then what were the last 15 years of fighting even for?

828
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,480
嘿 14个人因你而死
