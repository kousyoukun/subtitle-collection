1
00:00:04,398 --> 00:00:05,798
I'm not sure
what smells worse,

2
00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:07,867
the water or the trash.

3
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:09,835
At this point,
I'd say it's us.

4
00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:13,372
How did I let you
talk me into this?

5
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:14,807
Blame Yale.

6
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:16,509
They're the ones
who find applicants

7
00:00:16,577 --> 00:00:19,812
with community service hours
to be highly desirable.

8
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:23,949
Unbelievable. I'm all-state
in water polo and lacrosse,

9
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:25,985
and my ancestors came over
on the <i>Mayflower.</i>

10
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:28,454
It doesn't get more
well-rounded than that.

11
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:32,858
What is that?

12
00:00:32,927 --> 00:00:35,694
- A boot?
- How does somebody lose a boot?

13
00:00:40,935 --> 00:00:42,868
That's gonna stain.

14
00:00:54,048 --> 00:00:55,748
Oh, screw this.

15
00:00:55,816 --> 00:00:57,683
Yale can wait-list me.

16
00:00:57,752 --> 00:01:01,752

18
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,549
That's so cool.
Thank you.

19
00:01:30,618 --> 00:01:32,651
Ah, look
who finally made it.

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,853
Where have the two of you been?

21
00:01:34,922 --> 00:01:37,356
Oh, another sunrise
sketching session.

22
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:40,059
Have you guys ever taken in dawn
at the, uh, Navy Yard?

23
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:41,627
It is quite peaceful.

24
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:44,029
That's the fifth time this week.
Yeah, that street art case

25
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:45,898
really inspired us
to get back into drawing.

26
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:48,233
So while the two of you
have been playing Picasso,

27
00:01:48,302 --> 00:01:51,470
McGee and I have been
working our asses off.

28
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,638
Oh, really?

29
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:55,974
Ha! Diligent research,
I'm sure. Hmm.

30
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:57,843
All right, well,
let's see what you two drew.

31
00:01:57,912 --> 00:01:59,545
We were rushed.

32
00:01:59,613 --> 00:02:02,047
It's-it's not
the best, but...

33
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:03,315
Oh, wow.

34
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:04,761
What, are you kidding?
These are amazing.

35
00:02:04,785 --> 00:02:06,763
Jimmy, I had no idea
you could draw like this, man.

36
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:08,053
What?

37
00:02:08,122 --> 00:02:09,588
Want to see talent?

38
00:02:09,657 --> 00:02:10,956
Check this out.

39
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:14,927
Is that
your painting

40
00:02:14,995 --> 00:02:16,662
from our guys' night out?
- That's right.

41
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:17,896
It's amazing, isn't it?

42
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:19,865
The, uh, police evidence bag
really adds

43
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:22,034
a level of realism to it.
- Texture.

44
00:02:22,103 --> 00:02:23,702
Nothing more real
than a dead sailor.

45
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:24,937
Grab your gear.

46
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:27,506
See you.

47
00:02:27,575 --> 00:02:29,608
Hey, let me see.

48
00:02:29,677 --> 00:02:31,677
Oh.

49
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:33,679
Twins paint
that, McGee?

50
00:02:33,748 --> 00:02:35,280
Not exactly, boss.

51
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:38,584
Gibbs cut me. He cut me deep.

52
00:02:38,652 --> 00:02:40,919
Everyone's a critic. Come on.

53
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,225
Waterway Volunteers
is a nonprofit

54
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:48,761
that clears trash
from rivers and oceans.

55
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,596
Saving sea turtles and dolphins

56
00:02:50,664 --> 00:02:54,199
from, you know,
plastic straws and all that.

57
00:02:54,268 --> 00:02:55,601
Straws are bad?

58
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:57,114
Plastic straws are poison
to sea life.

59
00:02:57,138 --> 00:02:58,982
- Here, check out this video.
- No, not the video.

60
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:01,740
- I can't watch that thing again.
- You're not the one

61
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:03,776
with a synthetic rod
constricting your airway.

62
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:05,210
All right, Veronica,

63
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:06,979
Archie, let's stay on track.

64
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:08,280
What time
did you guys

65
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:09,481
arrive on the scene?

66
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,150
6:00 a.m.

67
00:03:11,218 --> 00:03:12,796
Did you guys see anything
out of the ordinary?

68
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,353
You mean other
than the dead body?

69
00:03:15,723 --> 00:03:17,656
Actually, hold up.

70
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:20,259
Did you want us
to see something?

71
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:22,561
What?

72
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,965
Maybe if we tell you
what you want to hear,

73
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:29,802
NCIS could write a couple
of letters of commendation

74
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,670
to the Yale Admissions Board
on our behalf?

75
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:35,174
Okay. Yale?

76
00:03:35,242 --> 00:03:36,875
Yeah.
Keep dreaming, buddy.

77
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:39,778
What do you got, Palmer?

78
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:41,180
Well, other than
the broken neck,

79
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:42,526
there's no outward
signs of trauma.

80
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,016
Agent Torres.
You have time of death?

81
00:03:44,084 --> 00:03:45,517
Condition of the body
points to him

82
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:46,985
being in the water
for some time.

83
00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:48,287
I'd say close to a week.

84
00:03:48,355 --> 00:03:51,523
I wasn't able to confirm his
identity using fingerprints.

85
00:03:51,592 --> 00:03:53,292
Yeah, the guppies
got to him first.

86
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,327
That is the circle of life,
gentlemen.

87
00:03:58,232 --> 00:03:59,431
I mean that in the most

88
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,877
respectful way possible,
by the way.

89
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:02,145
We found his military
I.D. in his pocket,

90
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:04,336
and according to the
name tag on his uniform,

91
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:07,773
our victim is Senior
Chief Richard Granger,

92
00:04:07,842 --> 00:04:10,209
assigned to the
Defense Logistics Agency.

93
00:04:10,277 --> 00:04:13,378
Ah, Jethro, I gave the body
a quick examination.

94
00:04:13,447 --> 00:04:14,613
While there was no

95
00:04:14,682 --> 00:04:16,548
outward appearance of trauma...

96
00:04:16,617 --> 00:04:17,549
Neck is broken.

97
00:04:17,618 --> 00:04:19,218
Already got that, Duck.

98
00:04:19,286 --> 00:04:21,353
Oh.

99
00:04:21,422 --> 00:04:22,888
Hey, Gibbs.

100
00:04:22,957 --> 00:04:24,556
We have a big problem.

101
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,059
I just got off the phone with
the Defense Logistics Agency,

102
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:29,828
where Senior Chief
Granger worked.

103
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:31,463
Any reason they didn't
report him UA?

104
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:32,965
That's the thing.

105
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:37,536
Uh, the person I spoke to
was Senior Chief Granger.

106
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:38,804
He's alive.

107
00:04:38,873 --> 00:04:41,406
Then who is this?

108
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:53,609
<i>Do you recognize him?</i>

109
00:04:53,677 --> 00:04:55,043
My God.

110
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:56,218
No. Who is he?

111
00:04:56,242 --> 00:04:57,780
That's what we
want to know.

112
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:00,148
How'd he get your military I.D.
and your uniform?

113
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,728
My apartment was
broken into last week,

114
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:03,151
and some of my
gear was stolen.

115
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,387
I filed a police report,
but nothing came of it.

116
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:07,389
Any idea why
someone would want

117
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,891
to impersonate you,
Chief Granger?

118
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,126
Not a clue.

119
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:13,462
I'm a personnel clerk
in a logistics depot.

120
00:05:13,531 --> 00:05:15,130
Not exactly a sexy job,

121
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,279
unless you're into color-coded
organizational charts.

122
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,403
Hold on.

123
00:05:21,472 --> 00:05:23,672
Do I need protection
or something?

124
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,374
A guy pretending
to be me was killed.

125
00:05:25,442 --> 00:05:27,509
Does that mean
I'm being targeted?

126
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:29,011
Who said he was killed?

127
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,713
Not many people end up in the
Potomac from natural causes.

128
00:05:31,782 --> 00:05:32,948
Mm.

129
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:44,059
Oh.

130
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:46,194
I am so sorry, Doctor. I...

131
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,263
I meant to clear
all my stuff out of here

132
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:50,332
now that you're back here
at NCIS full-time.

133
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:51,934
Dr. Palmer.
I know, I know.

134
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:56,438
An organized workspace
is an efficient workspace.

135
00:05:56,507 --> 00:06:00,008
Yes, it is, but I was about to
commend you on this drawing.

136
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:02,945
- Oh, really?
- Yes, amazing detail.

137
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:05,080
I particularly like
the way you've drawn

138
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:08,717
the superior and inferior
vena cava.

139
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,919
It seems you are as skillful
with a pencil

140
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:12,721
as you are with a scalpel.

141
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,391
Hopefully, I don't get the two
confused. That could get messy.

142
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:21,029
Right.

143
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:22,731
It's good to have you
back here, Doctor.

144
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,578
Things weren't the same
around here without you.

145
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:26,902
Yeah, it's a welcome change
from my book tour.

146
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:30,305
Hey, Ducky. You rang?
Yeah, our examination

147
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:32,407
was correct--
the cause of death

148
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,710
was a fracture
to the C3 vertebra.

149
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:36,745
But it wasn't from
the fall into the water.

150
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:38,380
The victim was dead beforehand.

151
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:39,449
So not a suicide?

152
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:41,650
Not unless he broke his own neck

153
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:43,952
and then somehow managed
to roll himself into the water.

154
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:47,823
Broke his own neck and rolled
himself into the water?

155
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:50,459
You know, I don't
have a story for that one.

156
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:55,597
Oh, that's never
happened before.

157
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,899
I'm very uncomfortable
right now.

158
00:06:57,968 --> 00:06:59,901
Oh, so am I.

159
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,069
Permission to proceed?

160
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:02,471
Granted.

161
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:04,172
All right, during
our examination,

162
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:06,575
we found a metal rod
in the victim's leg

163
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:08,010
from a previous
surgery.

164
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:09,678
I ran the serial number
in the system,

165
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:11,113
came up with a hit.

166
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,448
- So who's our victim?
<i>- Meet our victim</i>

167
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,685
and Navy impersonator,
Wesley Moore. He's 31.

168
00:07:16,754 --> 00:07:18,654
He's a freelance
cyber systems engineer.

169
00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:20,989
Unmarried, no kids,
no next of kin,

170
00:07:21,058 --> 00:07:22,858
which explains why
he was missing for a week

171
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:25,427
and no one reported it.
- Criminal record?

172
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:28,263
Other than a few late student
loan payments, this guy's clean.

173
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:30,076
Yeah, Moore had a brief stint
in the military

174
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,767
eight years ago
before washing out

175
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:34,169
of Marine Officer Candidate
School after a leg injury.

176
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:35,682
What about his movements
the night he was killed?

177
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,673
We tracked Moore's steps
with the I.D. he stole

178
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:39,007
from Senior Chief
Granger.

179
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:40,609
He used it
to gain access

180
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:42,277
to the Defense Logistics Agency.

181
00:07:42,346 --> 00:07:43,979
And security cameras at the gate

182
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:45,814
captured his vehicle
entering the premises

183
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,383
at 2100 hours last Wednesday.

184
00:07:48,452 --> 00:07:49,718
Yeah, he exited
two hours later.

185
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:50,864
After that,
Moore fell off the grid.

186
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,287
BOLO's already out on the car.

187
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:55,123
Why'd he sneak into the DLA?

188
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:57,392
To hack into the DoD's
classified message traffic.

189
00:07:57,461 --> 00:07:59,061
I'm working on
what he accessed,

190
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:00,840
but sensitive data on
troops' movements overseas

191
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:02,564
might have been compromised.

192
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:05,133
And we got a serious
security breach on our hands.

193
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:06,635
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

194
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:08,181
Hi, Gibbs. Do you have a minute?

195
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:09,371
Yeah, be right down.

196
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,373
Find out what Moore was after.

197
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:20,348
Water currents?

198
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,651
Yeah, you'd think a person
who builds boats

199
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,554
would find tide shifts
more fascinating.

200
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:26,702
A lead would be
fascinating.

201
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,256
This is the lead.

202
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:30,158
What, did you think
I invited you down here

203
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:33,462
for some riveting nonverbal
conversation?

204
00:08:34,565 --> 00:08:36,598
Okay, uh, moving on.

205
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:39,501
So, I have been analyzing
the coastal tide patterns

206
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,269
for the past six days,

207
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:44,673
working backwards from where
Wesley Moore's body washed up

208
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:47,709
to determine where his body
first entered the water.

209
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,678
- Narrowed down the search grid.
- Hey!

210
00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:52,180
Now we're on
the same wavelength.

211
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:53,749
Okay.

212
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:58,553
And not a fan of puns.
Okay, um, good to know.

213
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:01,156
Okay, if my calculations
are correct,

214
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:02,491
Moore's body was dumped

215
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,595
somewhere within a two-mile
stretch of shoreline near...

216
00:09:06,663 --> 00:09:07,963
North Old Town.

217
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:12,367
Uh, Gibbs,
I've got something.

218
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:15,570
Wesley Moore's e-mail
and phone records indicate

219
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,974
he received several messages
from Captain Alicia Voit,

220
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:22,210
a Marine stationed
in Kabul, Afghanistan.

221
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,912
And in their last
correspondence,

222
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,481
two weeks ago,
Voit e-mailed Moore

223
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,284
the names of
12 dead Marines.

224
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:30,754
Please tell me this is
not another hit list.

225
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,387
No.

226
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:33,121
Not so much.
All of those Marines died

227
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,757
prior to Voit's message
being sent.

228
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,225
Why would she
message a list

229
00:09:37,294 --> 00:09:39,227
of deceased Marines'
names to Moore?

230
00:09:39,296 --> 00:09:40,595
Contact the base
in Kabul.

231
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:44,099
- Get Voit on MTAC.
- Uh, Gibbs,

232
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,567
that's impossible.

233
00:09:45,636 --> 00:09:48,770
Captain Alicia Voit was killed
in action six days ago,

234
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,939
same day as
our victim,

235
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,707
Wesley Moore.

236
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:57,245
Captain Alicia Voit, 30,

237
00:09:57,314 --> 00:09:59,080
a highly decorated
Marine

238
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:02,117
who was serving her third tour
in Afghanistan.

239
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,585
She was killed
six days ago

240
00:10:03,654 --> 00:10:05,987
after her convoy was ambushed
by Taliban insurgents

241
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:07,189
just outside of Kabul.

242
00:10:07,257 --> 00:10:08,356
The attack was led

243
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:09,624
by Aazar Atwa,

244
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,793
an extremist responsible
for multiple

245
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,528
U.S. casualties
over the past year.

246
00:10:13,597 --> 00:10:16,264
Captain Voit's body was sent
to Dover Air Force Base.

247
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,466
Her remains are set
to be released tomorrow.

248
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,335
What's her connection
to Wesley Moore?

249
00:10:20,404 --> 00:10:22,015
They met at Marine Officer
Candidate School

250
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,371
eight years ago.

251
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,652
Moore washed out of the program,
but the two remained close.

252
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:27,076
They were definitely
more than that.

253
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,545
I mean, by their e-mails
and social media posts,

254
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:32,180
yeah, they were
definitely involved.

255
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:33,982
Um, I read those letters.

256
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,316
There was nothing
romantic in them.

257
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,252
Bishop.

258
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:38,186
Single guy, single girl.
Do the math.

259
00:10:38,255 --> 00:10:40,188
News flash, Torres.

260
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:42,624
Uh, men and women can have
platonic relationships.

261
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:44,392
Why?

262
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:47,662
McGee, what about the Intel
Moore hacked from the DLA?

263
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,398
He accessed the non-redacted
after-action reports

264
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:52,000
on the 12 K.I.A. Marines

265
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:55,036
Captain Voit listed
in her last e-mail to him.

266
00:10:55,105 --> 00:10:58,206
All were victims of Aazar Atwa's
previous attacks.

267
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:00,141
Torres, focus
on Kasie's search grid.

268
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,177
Find out where Moore's body
was dumped.

269
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:03,912
McGee, Bishop,
get your go-bags.

270
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:06,882
- Go-bags?
- Oh, where are we going?

271
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,483
Afghanistan.

272
00:11:18,313 --> 00:11:20,713
Present arms!

273
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:37,463
Order arms!

274
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:43,069
Right or left, face!

275
00:11:43,138 --> 00:11:46,239
Forward march!

276
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:55,682
You must be Agent Gibbs.

277
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,518
HQ said to expect you.
Colonel Park.

278
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:01,354
You're the Marine escort
assigned to Captain Voit?

279
00:12:01,423 --> 00:12:04,957
Affirmative. I am tasked
with her final transit home.

280
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:07,927
The captain's remains should be
released within the hour.

281
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:11,531
Something wrong?

282
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:13,110
Colonels aren't usually
assigned these details.

283
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:14,467
A Marine goes
where he's needed,

284
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:16,035
Agent Gibbs.

285
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:18,204
What's your destination?

286
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:21,074
Strathmere, New Jersey.
Captain Voit's hometown.

287
00:12:21,142 --> 00:12:24,210
Our transport will be departing
at 1000 hours.

288
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,713
Colonel, I'm afraid
there's going to be a delay.

289
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:29,415
- Excuse me?
- Captain Voit

290
00:12:29,484 --> 00:12:31,884
is now part of an active
murder investigation.

291
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:36,923
Murder investigation?

292
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,469
I wasn't informed of that.

293
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:39,693
Her remains are
to be brought

294
00:12:39,694 --> 00:12:42,328
to NCIS until we have
more answers.

295
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:46,332
I understand your...

296
00:12:46,401 --> 00:12:49,168
your situation, Agent Gibbs,

297
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:51,037
but I cannot allow that.

298
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,073
It's not a request, Colonel.

299
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:57,443
It's my duty
to get the captain home

300
00:12:57,512 --> 00:12:59,645
to be laid to rest in two days.

301
00:12:59,714 --> 00:13:02,115
And I'll do everything I can
to ensure that happens.

302
00:13:02,183 --> 00:13:04,517
With all due respect,
that's not good enough for me.

303
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:06,953
Colonel, there's a possibility
that Captain Voit's death

304
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:09,021
is connected
to another murder case.

305
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,124
We owe it to
both victims

306
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:12,825
to find out the truth.

307
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:19,065
That is something
we do agree on.

308
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:23,636
All right.

309
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:25,838
But I'm going with you.

310
00:13:25,907 --> 00:13:28,541
Don't expect me
to leave the captain's side.

311
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,842
Understood.

312
00:13:36,017 --> 00:13:37,817
What kind of mud is this?

313
00:13:37,886 --> 00:13:39,819
It feels like quicksand.

314
00:13:39,888 --> 00:13:42,688
Are you sure this is
the right search grid?

315
00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:45,069
Oh, yeah, positive. Moore's body
had to have entered the water,

316
00:13:45,093 --> 00:13:47,026
like, around here.

317
00:13:47,095 --> 00:13:50,496
Oh, my... oh, my...
oh, my God! Oh, my God!

318
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:52,365
Oh, my God, did you see
the size of that fly?

319
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:55,001
It was, like, prehistoric.

320
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:58,504
Uh, consider this your crash
course on field agent work.

321
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:00,618
Yeah, okay, well, getting
covered in grime and, like,

322
00:14:00,642 --> 00:14:04,010
eaten by flies isn't exactly
the high-octane experience

323
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:06,212
you promised.
- The day's young, sister.

324
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:08,147
Fine, but if I see
one snake, I am...

325
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:09,916
I'm out of here.

326
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:11,462
Wait, snake? What are you...
Wait, what do you mean, snake?

327
00:14:11,486 --> 00:14:12,663
What are you talking
about, snakes?

328
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:14,921
Oh, yeah. They thrive
in swampy ecosystems.

329
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:18,758
All right, okay.

330
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:20,827
Well, uh... stay on it.

331
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:24,479
Get 'er done. I'm gonna...
I'll be right back.

332
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,233
Yeah, that's usually
what someone says

333
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:28,501
right before they're killed
in a horror movie,

334
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,603
but yeah, I'm sure
this is totally different.

335
00:14:30,672 --> 00:14:34,040
I love my job,
I love my job, I love my job,

336
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:35,441
I love my job. Oof!

337
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,677
Hey, man.

338
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:39,345
Can I have a word?

339
00:14:40,615 --> 00:14:42,215
Hey, it's about time.

340
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:44,817
Been out here on
my own all morning.

341
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:49,689
What, are you waiting
for an invitation?

342
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:51,190
Start pulling your weight.

343
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:53,926
Okay, take it down
a notch, buddy. NCIS.

344
00:14:55,997 --> 00:14:58,130
Sorry about that. I, uh...

345
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,899
I thought you were
one of our volunteers.

346
00:14:59,968 --> 00:15:02,401
He's over an hour
and a half late.

347
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,770
Are you with, uh,
Waterway Volunteers?

348
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:06,973
Uh, yeah. That's right.

349
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,441
I spent my
morning covering

350
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,443
a half-mile stretch that way.

351
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:12,578
Why? What's NCIS doing out here?

352
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:15,615
Nick! Got something!

353
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,557
What kind of car did you say
Wesley Moore had?

354
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:26,859
It's a silver Ford Focus.

355
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:36,769
Not bad, Kasie.

356
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:38,838
Thanks.

357
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:49,248
Why would a decorated Marine
like Captain Voit get mixed up

358
00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:51,083
with somebody like Wesley Moore?

359
00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:52,952
Well, they're not
that different, Leon.

360
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:56,656
Both were orphaned as teenagers,
were children of public servants

361
00:15:56,724 --> 00:15:59,692
and shared this pure desire
to serve their country.

362
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:01,661
Are we talking
about the same Moore?

363
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:03,863
The one who impersonated
a Navy sailor,

364
00:16:03,932 --> 00:16:05,998
who broke onto a secure
military facility

365
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:08,868
and hacked into
a confidential DoD server,

366
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:11,304
putting thousands
of U.S. troops at risk?

367
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:12,939
Hey, I didn't say
he was perfect.

368
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:14,307
Well, there's an understatement.

369
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,775
But I don't believe that Moore

370
00:16:15,843 --> 00:16:18,444
accessed those files
for nefarious reasons.

371
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:20,513
He-he did it to help Voit.

372
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:21,714
Help how?

373
00:16:21,783 --> 00:16:23,015
Voit was looking for answers.

374
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:24,361
Right.
On the 12 dead Marines.

375
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:25,551
She knew that Moore

376
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,462
could hack into DoD's system

377
00:16:27,463 --> 00:16:29,306
and cut through
the governmental red tape.

378
00:16:29,307 --> 00:16:31,053
Yeah, in a highly illegal way.

379
00:16:31,054 --> 00:16:33,218
Which suggests a
sense of urgency.

380
00:16:33,219 --> 00:16:36,604
Now, Captain Voit
reached out to Moore

381
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:39,553
instead of going through
her chain of command. Why?

382
00:16:39,554 --> 00:16:40,919
'Cause Voit didn't know
who to trust.

383
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,017
Exactly.

384
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,737
You think their deaths
are connected?

385
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:44,738
100%.

386
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:46,339
They both died the same day--

387
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:48,407
one in D.C., one in Afghanistan.

388
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:50,142
Coordinated attacks, yeah?

389
00:16:50,211 --> 00:16:53,479
And the key to why has to do
with Afghanistan.

390
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:55,881
And this is usually
the time you tell me

391
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,184
that you've already sent
a team en route.

392
00:16:58,252 --> 00:16:59,819
Sent McGee and Bishop
this morning.

393
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:01,921
They should be
at Camp Russell any minute.

394
00:17:03,391 --> 00:17:06,993
Don't ask me. I-I don't know
how he does it, either.

395
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:23,009
The CG's been briefed
on the situation.

396
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:25,544
He said to assist
in any way possible.

397
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:26,957
When can we speak with him?
Well, he's finishing up

398
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:29,015
with a new Marine detachment
that arrived today.

399
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,794
Thought, uh, U.S. forces
were supposed to be

400
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:32,952
withdrawing from Afghanistan.
- That was the plan.

401
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:34,598
But with the Taliban's
attacks increasing

402
00:17:34,622 --> 00:17:35,933
and their grip on
Kabul strengthening,

403
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:37,456
the withdrawal's
been put on hold.

404
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:39,358
So you're familiar
with Aazar Atwa?

405
00:17:39,427 --> 00:17:41,293
Yes, ma'am. You'd be
hard-pressed to find

406
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:42,695
a Marine here
who isn't.

407
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:44,697
We've lost a lot of good people
because of him.

408
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:47,099
Captain Voit was just
the most recent casualty.

409
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:50,536
You could say Atwa is public
enemy number one around here.

410
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:52,238
Agents Bishop
and McGee.

411
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:55,207
I'm General Braxton,
CG of Camp Russell.

412
00:17:55,276 --> 00:17:57,021
- Appreciate the assistance, General.
- Of course.

413
00:17:57,045 --> 00:17:58,644
Captain Voit was one of our own.

414
00:17:58,713 --> 00:18:00,479
We want her to have justice.

415
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:03,282
And it looks like you both have
arrived just in time to see it.

416
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:04,483
How's that?

417
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:06,052
I received word from our patrol

418
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,965
in the northeast sector
who were conducting a raid

419
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:09,989
of a suspected Taliban
safe house.

420
00:18:10,058 --> 00:18:12,391
- Did they find the weapons cache?
- Better.

421
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,994
They found Aazar Atwa.

422
00:18:15,063 --> 00:18:16,495
Wh-Where's Atwa now?

423
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:18,831
En route back to our base,
under heavy guard.

424
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,301
You have questions
about Captain Voit's death?

425
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,290
You'll soon get the chance
to question her killer

426
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:25,504
face-to-face.

427
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:43,776
Are you sure there's nothing
I can get for you, Colonel?

428
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:46,312
No. Thank you. I'm fine.

429
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,015
Do you mind me asking what's,
uh... what's in the bag?

430
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:53,552
Contains Captain Voit's
personal effects.

431
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:56,355
Ah. Yeah, I couldn't
help but notice that...

432
00:18:56,424 --> 00:18:58,958
you won't let it out of
your sight, even for a second.

433
00:18:59,026 --> 00:19:00,793
Per DoD regulations,

434
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:03,028
a fallen service member's
personal effects

435
00:19:03,097 --> 00:19:05,898
shall remain in the escort's
possession at all times

436
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:08,634
until directly delivered
to the next of kin.

437
00:19:08,703 --> 00:19:10,903
Mm-hmm.

438
00:19:10,972 --> 00:19:14,006
You know, I can't imagine a more
difficult detail for a Marine

439
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:18,811
to be assigned than escorting
a fallen brother or sister home.

440
00:19:20,715 --> 00:19:23,749
I suspect your job
is not much different, Doctor.

441
00:19:23,818 --> 00:19:28,554
Yeah. It's a, uh...
it's a struggle at times.

442
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:30,556
But I take comfort
in knowing that we're helping

443
00:19:30,624 --> 00:19:32,324
to provide with some closure.

444
00:19:33,394 --> 00:19:35,394
My comfort is inconsequential.

445
00:19:36,731 --> 00:19:38,075
Those that make
the ultimate sacrifice

446
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:39,398
for this country

447
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:41,333
deserve to be brought home
with honor.

448
00:19:43,137 --> 00:19:45,237
Duck, what do we know?

449
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:47,239
An examination
of Captain Voit

450
00:19:47,308 --> 00:19:49,441
could not be performed since

451
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,044
she has already been
processed for burial.

452
00:19:52,113 --> 00:19:55,280
But the records from
Kabul and Dover

453
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:56,849
are very thorough.

454
00:19:56,917 --> 00:20:00,085
The captain was first struck
with two bullets to the chest.

455
00:20:00,154 --> 00:20:01,887
Uh, despite
her grave condition,

456
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:04,456
she managed to take
out four insurgents

457
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:07,960
before the third and
fatal blow to the head.

458
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:09,094
She never gave up.

459
00:20:09,163 --> 00:20:11,430
That's a Marine.

460
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:14,967
Okay. We are done here.

461
00:20:15,036 --> 00:20:16,969
- Colonel?
- I complied with your request,

462
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,205
Agent Gibbs. I allowed you
to bring Captain Voit here,

463
00:20:20,274 --> 00:20:21,974
against my better judgment.

464
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:24,443
As your doctors
have just pointed out,

465
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:26,378
she is of no further use to you.

466
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:28,781
Release her remains,
and allow me

467
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:30,482
to finish my mission.

468
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:32,317
Evidence is still
being processed.

469
00:20:32,386 --> 00:20:33,919
Our investigation isn't over.

470
00:20:33,988 --> 00:20:35,954
But my cooperation is.

471
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:38,657
W-We'll give you two a moment.

472
00:20:43,731 --> 00:20:45,664
- What's this?
- A memo,

473
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:47,399
from the Secretary of Defense,

474
00:20:47,468 --> 00:20:49,268
ensuring your
full cooperation.

475
00:20:49,336 --> 00:20:51,270
Explain to me how the captain
can be involved

476
00:20:51,338 --> 00:20:54,006
in a murder in the States
when she was in Afghanistan.

477
00:20:54,075 --> 00:20:55,908
This makes no sense.

478
00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:57,709
I'm doing my job!

479
00:20:59,313 --> 00:21:01,346
I thought you were
a Marine, Gibbs.

480
00:21:01,415 --> 00:21:05,117
If you were,
you'd have her back.

481
00:21:05,186 --> 00:21:09,188
Her burial is in 36 hours.

482
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:11,056
I will get her there.

483
00:21:29,677 --> 00:21:31,210
Hey, Kasie.

484
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:32,511
How you doing?

485
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,180
On a scale of one to ten?

486
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:36,281
We're in the negatives.

487
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,350
- Whoa.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

488
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:41,153
I tried being a field agent,
and it bit me.

489
00:21:41,222 --> 00:21:42,488
Look at me.

490
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:44,523
It's like a
connect-the-dots sheet.

491
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:48,393
I'm not really laughing.

492
00:21:48,462 --> 00:21:50,462
Okay, well, since work is
one of the only things

493
00:21:50,531 --> 00:21:52,564
distracting me from
the urge to itch,

494
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:54,466
I'm just gonna
jump right in.

495
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:57,402
I didn't find any usable
prints in Wesley Moore's car,

496
00:21:57,471 --> 00:22:00,405
but I hit the jackpot
with the rear body damage.

497
00:22:00,474 --> 00:22:02,341
Check this out.

498
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:04,343
This is a surveillance image

499
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:06,311
of Moore leaving the DLA

500
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,460
on the night that he was killed.
You notice anything?

501
00:22:11,652 --> 00:22:14,219
- Taillight and fender are intact.
- Yeah.

502
00:22:14,288 --> 00:22:16,755
Meaning this vehicle was damaged
later that night,

503
00:22:16,824 --> 00:22:18,490
before he was killed.

504
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,570
So, if he was being tailed,
the killer must have, uh,

505
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:23,162
caused a fender bender
to get Moore out of the car.

506
00:22:24,598 --> 00:22:25,998
So I pulled a second
paint profile

507
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:28,200
of the killer's car
in question. Whoo!

508
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:30,836
Try saying that
five times fast.

509
00:22:30,905 --> 00:22:34,273
And it is a lacquer-based red
with a metallic base coat.

510
00:22:34,341 --> 00:22:36,241
Okay, hundreds of cars
match that.

511
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,410
Actually, since it's
one of the most used

512
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:40,345
paint types in production,

513
00:22:40,414 --> 00:22:42,714
the number's more
in the thousands.

514
00:22:42,783 --> 00:22:44,394
How do you suggest
we narrow down our suspects?

515
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:46,685
Well, with, uh,
persistence, diligence,

516
00:22:46,754 --> 00:22:48,387
and our combined
computer skills.

517
00:22:48,455 --> 00:22:52,191
Combined?
What am I, Bishop or McGee?

518
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:53,458
No, I'm more of, like,

519
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:55,127
a physical specimen,
man, you know?

520
00:22:55,196 --> 00:22:56,528
You know, punching,
intimidating,

521
00:22:56,597 --> 00:22:58,197
that's more my thing.
- Mm, okay.

522
00:22:58,265 --> 00:23:01,633
I trekked through a swamp
for you, Nicholas.

523
00:23:01,702 --> 00:23:04,636
So, if you bail on me now,
you're just gonna find

524
00:23:04,705 --> 00:23:07,940
a slithering copperhead snake
in your desk drawer.

525
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:10,309
Ooh, or in your bed.

526
00:23:11,545 --> 00:23:13,478
Or worse.

527
00:23:16,217 --> 00:23:18,650
Is it just me,

528
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:21,119
or does this feel...
Too easy?

529
00:23:21,188 --> 00:23:22,621
No, it's not just you.

530
00:23:29,396 --> 00:23:32,831
He looks pretty carefree
for a captured terrorist.

531
00:23:35,302 --> 00:23:36,435
You gonna translate?

532
00:23:36,503 --> 00:23:39,504
No. I don't need to,

533
00:23:39,573 --> 00:23:41,673
'cause he can understand us
just fine.

534
00:23:41,742 --> 00:23:43,342
Isn't that right?

535
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,577
Yes, I can.

536
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:49,581
Sorry, does something amuse you?

537
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,850
This. All of it.

538
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,119
Well, let me show you
what I don't find funny.

539
00:23:54,188 --> 00:23:55,487
Alicia Voit,

540
00:23:55,556 --> 00:23:58,624
Max Wiezman,

541
00:23:58,692 --> 00:24:00,759
Anna Gutierrez,

542
00:24:00,828 --> 00:24:03,996
Tyson Eccles, Nolan Takahamo.

543
00:24:04,064 --> 00:24:05,163
Should I continue?

544
00:24:05,232 --> 00:24:07,043
- Those names mean nothing to me.
- Well, they should.

545
00:24:07,067 --> 00:24:09,107
They're the names of some
of the Marines you killed.

546
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,404
Again...

547
00:24:13,774 --> 00:24:15,140
...they mean nothing to me.

548
00:24:15,209 --> 00:24:16,975
So you don't deny it?

549
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:18,477
Why deny what I'm proud of?

550
00:24:18,545 --> 00:24:22,547
Well, if you're so proud,
tell us about her.

551
00:24:22,616 --> 00:24:24,816
She was part of the convoy
you hit last week.

552
00:24:24,885 --> 00:24:26,318
I remember.

553
00:24:26,387 --> 00:24:28,620
The sky was so clear that day.

554
00:24:28,689 --> 00:24:31,390
We could see their vehicle
from miles away,

555
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:33,325
unfortunately for her.

556
00:24:33,394 --> 00:24:35,193
Wasn't that easy.

557
00:24:35,262 --> 00:24:36,828
Captain Voit killed
four of your men

558
00:24:36,897 --> 00:24:38,297
before you could finish her off.

559
00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:40,132
Guess you underestimated her.

560
00:24:41,535 --> 00:24:44,069
Are we going to continue
this game,

561
00:24:44,138 --> 00:24:47,039
or do you want to know
the truth about my attacks?

562
00:24:47,107 --> 00:24:49,708
Tell us.

563
00:24:52,112 --> 00:24:54,546
Only if I get something
in return.

564
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:57,182
My freedom.

565
00:24:57,251 --> 00:24:58,717
How original.

566
00:24:58,786 --> 00:25:01,653
You're a terrorist
who killed 13 U.S. Marines.

567
00:25:01,722 --> 00:25:03,055
Hope you enjoy
those shackles,

568
00:25:03,123 --> 00:25:04,723
'cause you're gonna
be living in a cell

569
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:07,392
for the rest of your life.
Let's go.

570
00:25:10,898 --> 00:25:12,998
I had help,

571
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:14,733
from an American.

572
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:19,671
Now do I have your attention?

573
00:25:27,247 --> 00:25:30,082
You were working
with an American?

574
00:25:31,285 --> 00:25:32,285
Prove it.

575
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,786
My freedom for a traitor

576
00:25:34,855 --> 00:25:37,389
who's been betraying
your country.

577
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:39,891
Fair trade,

578
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,361
don't you think?

579
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,898
Atwa's out of his damn mind.

580
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:49,568
The U.S. government will not d
a deal with a known terrorist.

581
00:25:49,636 --> 00:25:52,371
I understand, Director,
but Atwa claims

582
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:54,317
he's been working with
an American on the inside.

583
00:25:54,341 --> 00:25:55,474
Atwa's smart.

584
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:57,142
He'll say whatever
we want to hear

585
00:25:57,211 --> 00:25:58,777
if it means securing
his release.

586
00:25:58,846 --> 00:26:01,580
We have no guarantee
what he gives us is the truth.

587
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:04,116
Yes, and normally, Sloane,
I would agree with you,

588
00:26:04,184 --> 00:26:07,452
but not this time. I-I really
don't think he's bluffing.

589
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:08,754
Bishop, what do you know?

590
00:26:08,822 --> 00:26:11,123
Look, I-I've dealt with
insurgents like Atwa before.

591
00:26:11,191 --> 00:26:13,959
He-he's not agitated,
nervous or volatile.

592
00:26:14,027 --> 00:26:15,894
He is, in fact, assured,

593
00:26:15,963 --> 00:26:18,430
like someone who knows
that they have the advantage.

594
00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:20,265
12 dead Marines.

595
00:26:20,334 --> 00:26:21,633
What about them?

596
00:26:21,702 --> 00:26:23,402
Transports were hit
by the Taliban.

597
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,837
Convoy routes are changed
at the last minute.

598
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:27,072
Yeah.

599
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:28,351
Someone had to be
directly relaying

600
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:29,641
their movements to Atwa.

601
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,943
Well, even if that's true,
it doesn't erase the fact

602
00:26:32,012 --> 00:26:35,180
that Atwa's caused
the deaths of multiple troops.

603
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:36,648
He wants to talk, Leon.

604
00:26:36,717 --> 00:26:39,618
Well, then get him to talk,
but he's not getting a deal.

605
00:26:39,686 --> 00:26:41,453
Is that clear?

606
00:26:41,522 --> 00:26:43,989
Uh, yes, yes, Director.

607
00:26:44,057 --> 00:26:45,690
Gibbs?

608
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,726
His friends don't need
to know that.

609
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,766
Colonel, it's late.

610
00:26:54,835 --> 00:26:57,669
Got a room waiting for you
at the BOQ.

611
00:26:57,738 --> 00:27:00,105
That won't be necessary.
I'm doing fine.

612
00:27:00,174 --> 00:27:01,940
DoD escorts are permitted

613
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:05,277
to leave
service members' remains

614
00:27:05,345 --> 00:27:07,112
at a secure location.

615
00:27:07,181 --> 00:27:09,314
I know what the
regulations say.

616
00:27:09,383 --> 00:27:12,484
I just don't feel right
leaving the captain alone.

617
00:27:12,553 --> 00:27:15,086
Yeah, figured you were gonna
say something like that.

618
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,127
What are you doing?

619
00:27:23,964 --> 00:27:25,630
I'm getting you a cot.

620
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:28,533
- I told you, I'm fine.
- Yeah, yeah, I know, you're fine.

621
00:27:28,602 --> 00:27:30,335
I got it, okay.

622
00:27:30,404 --> 00:27:32,070
Got to sleep somewhere.

623
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:34,005
Hey, take it
or leave it.

624
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:36,274
Your call.

625
00:27:45,219 --> 00:27:46,918
I owe you an apology

626
00:27:46,987 --> 00:27:48,887
for what I said earlier, Gibbs.

627
00:27:50,123 --> 00:27:52,891
It was wrong to question
your service.

628
00:27:54,928 --> 00:27:56,394
I've been there, Colonel.

629
00:27:56,463 --> 00:28:01,066
It is not easy

630
00:28:01,134 --> 00:28:03,768
getting assigned
an escort detail.

631
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:07,439
No.

632
00:28:07,508 --> 00:28:09,140
No, it's not.

633
00:28:11,645 --> 00:28:14,145
It's even harder
if you volunteered for it.

634
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:18,016
Was it that obvious?

635
00:28:22,356 --> 00:28:24,222
How'd you know Captain Voit?

636
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:27,926
I was the one who recruited her.

637
00:28:27,995 --> 00:28:32,397
Met Voit ten years ago.

638
00:28:32,466 --> 00:28:35,133
She had just lost both of
her parents the winter before.

639
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:36,968
She was putting herself
through college.

640
00:28:37,037 --> 00:28:40,639
She was a real hard worker,
and good head on her shoulders.

641
00:28:40,707 --> 00:28:43,074
Marine material.

642
00:28:43,143 --> 00:28:45,310
I can always tell within a...

643
00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:46,978
within a minute
of meeting somebody

644
00:28:47,047 --> 00:28:50,248
whether they have what it takes.

645
00:28:50,317 --> 00:28:51,650
Voit did.

646
00:28:53,654 --> 00:28:56,555
I was the one

647
00:28:56,623 --> 00:28:59,424
who swore her in,

648
00:28:59,493 --> 00:29:04,062
so I should be the one
to bring her home,

649
00:29:04,131 --> 00:29:07,899
just like I did
for all the other

650
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:11,069
fallen Marines
that I've recruited.

651
00:29:13,073 --> 00:29:14,439
How many?

652
00:29:14,508 --> 00:29:16,908
One is too many.

653
00:29:16,977 --> 00:29:21,212
You're not responsible
for their deaths, Colonel.

654
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:25,917
You've lost people, right?

655
00:29:25,986 --> 00:29:27,919
As a Marine,

656
00:29:27,988 --> 00:29:29,988
as an agent?

657
00:29:31,858 --> 00:29:34,259
Did you not feel responsible?

658
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:42,767
They were just...
just kids who...

659
00:29:42,836 --> 00:29:46,371
joined the military
under my guidance.

660
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:51,710
I'll carry their deaths with me

661
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:53,778
every day.

662
00:29:57,084 --> 00:29:59,117
I owe them that much.

663
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:06,291
- Where are we going?
- Transferring you.

664
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,159
To Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

665
00:30:08,228 --> 00:30:10,528
Hope you like humidity
and solitary.

666
00:30:10,597 --> 00:30:12,631
Is that supposed to frighten me?

667
00:30:12,699 --> 00:30:14,899
No, but putting you in a cell
with Gibbs may.

668
00:30:14,968 --> 00:30:16,134
Last chance, Atwa.

669
00:30:16,203 --> 00:30:17,836
Tell us the American
you're working with.

670
00:30:17,904 --> 00:30:20,238
Not until I'm released.
May want to rethink that.

671
00:30:20,307 --> 00:30:22,218
I can't imagine your fellow
insurgents would look favorably

672
00:30:22,242 --> 00:30:24,042
on you working with us.

673
00:30:24,111 --> 00:30:27,746
The fate of an American
isn't their concern.

674
00:30:27,814 --> 00:30:29,748
They know I would
never betray them.

675
00:30:29,816 --> 00:30:31,549
Well, unless we spread word
around town

676
00:30:31,618 --> 00:30:33,485
that you gave them up
for your freedom.

677
00:30:33,553 --> 00:30:34,919
We can be very convincing.

678
00:30:34,988 --> 00:30:37,489
They'll see you as a
traitor and a liability.

679
00:30:37,557 --> 00:30:39,891
You won't last one minute
outside those gates,

680
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,359
not without our protection.

681
00:30:41,428 --> 00:30:42,861
So, if you enjoy
breathing,

682
00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:44,062
I suggest you start talking

683
00:30:44,131 --> 00:30:45,964
and tell us who
your American contact is.

684
00:30:47,134 --> 00:30:49,567
Very well.

685
00:30:49,636 --> 00:30:53,338
12 months ago, I began receiving
intelligence from a source.

686
00:31:08,363 --> 00:31:10,564
What the hell happened, McGee?

687
00:31:10,632 --> 00:31:11,998
Sniper fire from the mountains.

688
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,983
No one had eyes on the shooter.

689
00:31:14,052 --> 00:31:15,484
Did Atwa give you anything?

690
00:31:15,553 --> 00:31:17,486
He was about to
when the gunfire started.

691
00:31:17,555 --> 00:31:19,455
Well, someone wanted
to shut him up.

692
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:20,834
Which means we got
a mole on our hands

693
00:31:20,858 --> 00:31:21,791
with advanced sniper training.

694
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:23,092
That's perfect.

695
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:25,561
The details of Atwa's transfer
never left Camp Russell.

696
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,763
So it had to be
someone in-house.

697
00:31:27,832 --> 00:31:29,832
Bishop's going through
all the personnel files now.

698
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:32,468
Listen to me, McGee,
you find him!

699
00:31:44,482 --> 00:31:47,583
I'm not sure I can stare
at this screen much longer.

700
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:49,986
This glare is making me squint,

701
00:31:50,054 --> 00:31:52,855
and this face doesn't do
wrinkles.

702
00:31:52,924 --> 00:31:54,423
Come on, team.

703
00:31:54,492 --> 00:31:55,925
Sure, we pulled
an all-nighter

704
00:31:55,994 --> 00:31:57,805
combing traffic-cam footage,
and we're no closer

705
00:31:57,829 --> 00:32:01,264
to finding our suspect, but
we're in this together, right?

706
00:32:01,332 --> 00:32:03,933
Friends helping friends.
Jimmy,

707
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:05,167
stop talking.

708
00:32:05,236 --> 00:32:08,004
Hey, Jimmy.

709
00:32:08,072 --> 00:32:09,705
When'd you get here?

710
00:32:09,774 --> 00:32:11,807
Oh, boy.

711
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:14,377
The top o' the morning to you.

712
00:32:14,445 --> 00:32:18,047
I bring much-needed
sustenance.

713
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:20,716
Two black coffees.

714
00:32:20,785 --> 00:32:22,885
There we are.
And, uh,

715
00:32:22,954 --> 00:32:25,788
one large double mocha

716
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:28,224
frozen blend
with whipping cream

717
00:32:28,293 --> 00:32:32,528
and chocolate chips,
and a drizzle of caramel.

718
00:32:32,597 --> 00:32:35,131
Yes.
Mm.

719
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:38,367
Now, that hits the spot.

720
00:32:38,436 --> 00:32:40,603
You can eat that
and still look like that?

721
00:32:42,106 --> 00:32:44,173
Man, life's not fair.

722
00:32:44,242 --> 00:32:46,208
Jimmy, uh, you disgust me.

723
00:32:46,277 --> 00:32:49,045
Hey... got something.

724
00:32:49,113 --> 00:32:51,914
Red truck matching
our description.

725
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:54,417
Ooh, complete with
front bumper damage.

726
00:32:54,485 --> 00:32:55,685
Where was this picture taken?

727
00:32:55,753 --> 00:32:57,720
Traffic cam,
ten miles from where

728
00:32:57,789 --> 00:32:59,322
Moore's car was found

729
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,923
on the night he was killed.

730
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:02,491
Who's the truck registered to?

731
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,694
Xavier Blackburn.

732
00:33:04,762 --> 00:33:06,395
Civilian from Falls Church.

733
00:33:06,464 --> 00:33:08,564
Hey, I ran into this guy
at the marsh.

734
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:11,067
He said he was with
Waterway Volunteers.

735
00:33:11,135 --> 00:33:13,936
Uh, there's no Xavier Blackburn
listed on their crew roster.

736
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:15,938
Then what was he doing
at the marsh?

737
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:17,973
Doing what all guilty people do.

738
00:33:19,444 --> 00:33:21,677
Covering his tracks.

739
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,516
So, let me see
if I got this right.

740
00:33:27,585 --> 00:33:29,752
Volunteering my time
makes me a murder suspect?

741
00:33:30,688 --> 00:33:32,388
Talk about "no good deed."

742
00:33:32,457 --> 00:33:36,926
Okay, so no one at
Waterway Volunteers

743
00:33:36,994 --> 00:33:38,094
has ever heard of you.

744
00:33:38,162 --> 00:33:40,463
I'm new. They must have lost
my paperwork.

745
00:33:40,531 --> 00:33:41,931
We didn't.

746
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:44,033
"Xavier Blackburn, 33."

747
00:33:44,102 --> 00:33:45,968
Spent six years
as a contractor

748
00:33:46,037 --> 00:33:47,970
for a private military
firm in Arlington.

749
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:49,405
Until you were fired

750
00:33:49,474 --> 00:33:52,375
because of behavioral issues.

751
00:33:52,443 --> 00:33:54,043
"Increasingly
violent outbursts

752
00:33:54,112 --> 00:33:56,879
and blatant disregard
for protocol."

753
00:33:56,948 --> 00:33:59,548
I had an occasional disagreement

754
00:33:59,617 --> 00:34:01,917
with a few short-sighted
superiors.

755
00:34:01,986 --> 00:34:03,519
I'm sure you can relate.

756
00:34:04,722 --> 00:34:06,389
Nice truck.

757
00:34:06,457 --> 00:34:09,959
At least it was.
We... we tracked it down

758
00:34:10,027 --> 00:34:11,267
to a body shop near your house.

759
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:12,628
And guess what.

760
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:16,465
The paint on your bumper was
a match to Wesley Moore's car.

761
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:20,302
Moore stole U.S. intelligence.

762
00:34:20,371 --> 00:34:21,771
Did you know that?

763
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,106
He was a risk
to national security

764
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:25,474
and needed to be stopped.

765
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:27,143
Moore was investigating
an American

766
00:34:27,211 --> 00:34:28,978
who was aiding the Taliban.

767
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:33,983
He wasn't the traitor, genius.

768
00:34:34,051 --> 00:34:37,119
No, you're wrong.
He told me Moore was dangerous.

769
00:34:37,188 --> 00:34:38,621
He?

770
00:34:38,689 --> 00:34:41,023
He said that if I neutralized
the threat,

771
00:34:41,092 --> 00:34:44,026
he would reinstate me,
and I would get my job back.

772
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:45,995
Who gave you the order?

773
00:34:48,566 --> 00:34:51,133
The patrol will leave
at 0500 hours.

774
00:34:51,202 --> 00:34:52,601
Jennings, you're driving lead.

775
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,104
Dunne and Falconio,
you're on the flank.

776
00:34:55,173 --> 00:34:57,006
- Kinneman.
- Yeah.

777
00:34:57,074 --> 00:34:59,675
Keep your eyes peeled
for insurgent activity.

778
00:34:59,744 --> 00:35:01,877
Rumors of Atwa's death
are no doubt

779
00:35:01,946 --> 00:35:03,023
circulating throughout the city,

780
00:35:03,047 --> 00:35:05,114
so retribution is expected.

781
00:35:05,183 --> 00:35:06,949
You're right about that.

782
00:35:07,018 --> 00:35:09,685
I'm sorry, Agents,
but this is a secure briefing.

783
00:35:09,754 --> 00:35:11,220
It's too late
for that, General.

784
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:12,833
Your patrol route's
already been compromised,

785
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:14,290
and not by us.

786
00:35:14,358 --> 00:35:15,369
What are you talking about?

787
00:35:15,393 --> 00:35:17,827
Go ahead, tell 'em.

788
00:35:17,895 --> 00:35:20,696
I don't know what you mean.

789
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:21,909
All right,
I'll give you a hint.

790
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:23,243
One word, begins
with the letter "T."

791
00:35:23,267 --> 00:35:24,366
Rhymes with "reason."

792
00:35:24,435 --> 00:35:27,570
Well, someone better start
making sense real soon.

793
00:35:27,638 --> 00:35:30,339
Kinneman here was leaking
your transport routes

794
00:35:30,408 --> 00:35:31,774
to Aazar Atwa.

795
00:35:34,545 --> 00:35:36,245
That's a lie.

796
00:35:36,314 --> 00:35:38,747
Really? All right.

797
00:35:38,816 --> 00:35:40,549
Does this guy look familiar?

798
00:35:40,618 --> 00:35:42,685
Your former coworker
and accomplice,

799
00:35:42,753 --> 00:35:44,253
Xavier Blackburn?

800
00:35:44,322 --> 00:35:45,521
He's in NCIS custody.

801
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,823
Gave you up in record time.

802
00:35:47,892 --> 00:35:49,391
Do... do not
listen to them.

803
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,526
This is a setup.

804
00:35:50,595 --> 00:35:53,095
Kinneman's a military
contractor.

805
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:55,364
Why would he be helping
the Taliban?

806
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:56,433
Simple economics.

807
00:35:56,501 --> 00:35:58,100
U.S. forces pull out of Kabul,

808
00:35:58,169 --> 00:36:00,836
his lucrative defense
contracts disappear.

809
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:02,872
If enemy attacks
increase in the area,

810
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,707
U.S. military strengthens
their presence,

811
00:36:04,775 --> 00:36:06,075
securing your funding.

812
00:36:06,143 --> 00:36:08,377
So you started passing Intel
to Atwa

813
00:36:08,446 --> 00:36:10,446
on certain convoys to attack.

814
00:36:10,515 --> 00:36:12,226
But Captain Voit
started digging around,

815
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,582
and you had to
put an end to it.

816
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:15,584
Then you had Atwa
strike Voit's convoy.

817
00:36:15,653 --> 00:36:17,987
Then you shot Atwa before
he could give you up.

818
00:36:18,055 --> 00:36:19,255
Easy target for someone

819
00:36:19,323 --> 00:36:21,857
with advanced sniper training,
such as yourself.

820
00:36:21,926 --> 00:36:23,392
Come on, Kinneman,

821
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:26,028
these guys deserve to know.

822
00:36:26,097 --> 00:36:28,697
How much were those
Marines' lives worth, huh?

823
00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:30,766
Five million? Ten?

824
00:36:34,272 --> 00:36:37,773
It wasn't about money.

825
00:36:37,842 --> 00:36:39,353
Are you kidding me?!
If the military withdraws

826
00:36:39,377 --> 00:36:41,777
and the Taliban takes control
of this area again,

827
00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:44,413
then what were the last
15 years of fighting even for?

828
00:36:44,482 --> 00:36:46,482
Hey, 14 people are
dead because of you.

829
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:48,717
You're as much a terrorist
as anyone like Atwa.

830
00:36:48,786 --> 00:36:50,185
Put your hands
behind your back.

831
00:37:09,173 --> 00:37:10,606
Hey, Doctor, I need
your signature

832
00:37:10,675 --> 00:37:13,075
on this body transfer.

833
00:37:14,412 --> 00:37:16,612
- What's going on?
- I am properly

834
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:19,448
displaying your artwork.

835
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:23,819
All these should be
shown and admired.

836
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:25,988
I can't believe
that you did this.

837
00:37:26,057 --> 00:37:27,756
I am touched.

838
00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:30,492
Oh, consider it
a parting gift.

839
00:37:32,096 --> 00:37:34,263
Parting gift?
You going somewhere?

840
00:37:34,332 --> 00:37:35,931
Indeed I am.

841
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,802
You can call it
a globetrotting adventure.

842
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:42,771
But you just got back.

843
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:46,675
You have proven yourself
more than capable

844
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:49,311
in the last year, Dr. Palmer.

845
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,213
I have no doubt that
you'll continue

846
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:53,549
to hold the fort while I'm gone.

847
00:37:53,618 --> 00:37:57,720
Sure, but you will
be back, right?

848
00:37:57,788 --> 00:37:59,021
Of course.

849
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:01,123
And when I return
in the new year,

850
00:38:01,192 --> 00:38:04,059
I shall have many more
stories to relate.

851
00:38:04,128 --> 00:38:05,694
Well, that's great.

852
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:07,796
What's the first stop
on your vacation gonna be?

853
00:38:07,865 --> 00:38:09,298
Something, uh, exotic?

854
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:12,368
Maybe the pyramids,
Great Wall of China?

855
00:38:12,436 --> 00:38:13,436
The Serengeti?

856
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:15,738
Mount Rushmore.

857
00:38:15,806 --> 00:38:19,675
South Dakota.
In the middle of winter.

858
00:38:19,744 --> 00:38:21,143
Mm.

859
00:38:22,947 --> 00:38:24,747
You are one in a million,
Doctor.

860
00:38:24,815 --> 00:38:26,081
True.

861
00:38:32,723 --> 00:38:35,357
Thank you for your
cooperation, Colonel.

862
00:38:35,426 --> 00:38:38,427
You know, this escort
mission has top priority.

863
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:40,329
I should be the one
thanking you, Gibbs.

864
00:38:40,398 --> 00:38:41,808
Those responsible
for Captain Voit's death

865
00:38:41,832 --> 00:38:43,565
have been brought
to justice.

866
00:38:43,634 --> 00:38:46,368
I only wish that could happen
for every fallen service member.

867
00:38:46,437 --> 00:38:49,505
What time is the
captain's funeral?

868
00:38:49,573 --> 00:38:51,940
0900 hours tomorrow.

869
00:38:52,009 --> 00:38:54,543
Strathmere, New Jersey.

870
00:38:54,612 --> 00:38:56,845
That's about a five-hour drive.
Looking for a navigator?

871
00:38:58,582 --> 00:39:00,516
You have your go-bag, Gunny?

872
00:39:00,584 --> 00:39:03,352
Already packed.
It's in the car.

873
00:39:03,421 --> 00:39:06,121
Company would be nice.

874
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,223
I know Voit would
appreciate having

875
00:39:08,292 --> 00:39:09,858
another Marine there
to see her off.

876
00:39:09,927 --> 00:39:12,094
My honor.

877
00:39:12,163 --> 00:39:15,864
You would have really
liked her, Gibbs.

878
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:18,767
She was as determined
as they come.

879
00:39:18,836 --> 00:39:21,036
Never backed down from a fight.

880
00:39:50,735 --> 00:39:52,267
Shall we?

881
00:39:52,336 --> 00:39:54,136
Yeah.

882
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:09,585
Rest easy, Marine.

883
00:40:09,653 --> 00:40:12,254
We got the watch.

884
