1
00:00:04,398 --> 00:00:05,798
我不確定哪個聞著更惡心
I'm not sure what smells worse,

2
00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:07,867
水還是垃圾
the water or the trash.

3
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:09,835
目前而言 我覺得最惡心的是我們
At this point, I'd say it's us.

4
00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:13,372
我是怎麼被你套路來這兒的
How did I let you talk me into this?

5
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:14,807
要怪就怪耶魯
Blame Yale.

6
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:16,509
是他們認為
They're the ones who find applicants

7
00:00:16,577 --> 00:00:19,812
做過社區服務的申請人更受歡迎
with community service hours to be highly desirable.

8
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:23,949
難以置信 我能通玩水球和曲棍球
Unbelievable. I'm all-state in water polo and lacrosse,

9
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:25,985
我的祖先乘坐五月花號來到這裏
and my ancestors came over on the <i>Mayflower.</i>

10
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:28,454
沒有比這更全面的了
It doesn't get more well-rounded than that.

11
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:32,858
那是什麼
What is that?

12
00:00:32,927 --> 00:00:35,694
-一只靴子 -怎麼會有人丟只靴子
- A boot? - How does somebody lose a boot?

13
00:00:40,935 --> 00:00:42,868
要弄髒了
That's gonna stain.

14
00:00:54,048 --> 00:00:55,748
哦 去你的吧
Oh, screw this.

15
00:00:55,816 --> 00:00:57,683
耶魯可以把我列到等候名單裏了
Yale can wait-list me.

你們倆去哪了
Where have the two of you been?

21
00:01:34,922 --> 00:01:37,356
另一次日出速寫集會
Oh, another sunrise sketching session.

22
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:40,059
你們見過海軍大院裏的黎明嗎
Have you guys ever taken in dawn at the, uh, Navy Yard?

23
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:41,627
十分靜謐
It is quite peaceful.

24

激勵我們回到繪畫上
really inspired us to get back into drawing.

26
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:48,233
你們倆扮畢加索的時候
So while the two of you have been playing Picasso,

27
00:01:48,302 --> 00:01:51,470
McGee和我忙得累死累活
McGee and I have been working our asses off.

28
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,638
哦 是嗎
Oh, really?

29
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:55,974
哈 我很確定你鑽研這個是非常用心的
Ha! Diligent research, I'm sure. Hmm.

30
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:57,843
好了 讓我看看你們畫了什麼
All right, well, let's see what you two drew.

31
00:01:57,912 --> 00:01:59,545
我們有點匆忙
We were rushed.

32
00:01:59,613 --> 00:02:02,047
不是最好的 但
It's-it's not the best, but...

33
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:03,315
哇喔
Oh, wow.

34
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:04,761

What, are you kidding? These are amazing.

35
00:02:04,785 --> 00:02:06,763
Jimmy 我完全不知道你能畫出這樣的作品
Jimmy, I had no idea you could draw like this, man.

36
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:08,053
什麼
What?

37

41
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:17,896
棒極了 不是嗎
It's amazing, isn't it?

42
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:19,865
警方的證物袋真的給這幅畫
The, uh, police evidence bag really adds

43
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:22,034
-添加了很多現實主義色彩 -質感
- a level of realism to it. - Texture.

44
00:02:22,103 --> 00:02:23,702
沒有什麼比一個死亡的海軍更現實
Nothing more real than a dead sailor.

45
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:24,937
帶上裝備
Grab your gear.

46
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:27,506

00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:33,679
龍兄鼠弟畫的嗎 McGee
【注：1988年的喜劇片】
Twins paint that, McGee?

50
00:02:33,748 --> 00:02:35,280
並不是 老大
Not exactly, boss.

51
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:38,584
Gibbs傷害了我 他深深傷害了我
Gibbs cut me. He cut me deep.

52
00:02:38,652 --> 00:02:40,919
每個人都是批評家 走吧
Everyone's a critic. Come on.

53
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,225
水道志願者是個非盈利組織

54
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:48,761
致力於清理河流和海洋垃圾

55
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,596
拯救海龜和海豚

56
00:02:50,664 --> 00:02:54,199
免受塑料吸管和其他東西的傷害
from, you know, plastic straws and all that.

57
00:02:54,268 --> 00:02:55,601
吸管有害嗎
Straws are bad?

58
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:57,114
塑料吸管於海洋生物就是毒藥
Plastic straws are poison to sea life.

59
00:02:57,138 --> 00:02:58,982
-看這個錄像 -不 不要看那個錄像
- Here, check out this video. - No, not the video.

60
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:01,740
-我沒法再看一遍了 -你又不是那個
- I can't watch that thing again. - You're not the one

61
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:03,776
氣管被合成吸管堵住的人
with a synthetic rod constricting your airway.

62
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:05,210
好了 Veronica

Archie 讓我們回歸正題
Archie, let's stay on track.

64
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:08,280
你們倆是
What time did you guys

65
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:09,481
什麼時候到的
arrive on the scene?

66
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,150
上午6點
6:00 a.m.

67
00:03:11,218 --> 00:03:12,796
你們看到什麼異常情況嗎
Did you guys see anything out of the ordinary?

68
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,353
你說屍體不算異常情況嗎
You mean other than the dead body?

69
00:03:15,723 --> 00:03:17,656
實際上 等下
Actually, hold up.

70
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:20,259
你想讓我們看見什麼嗎
Did you want us to see something?

71
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:22,561
啥
What?

72
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,965
也許如果我們說了你想聽的
Maybe if we tell you what you want to hear,

73
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:29,802
NCIS可以代表我們給耶魯招生委員會
NCIS could write a couple of letters of commendation

74
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,670
寫幾封推薦信
to the Yale Admissions Board on our behalf?

75
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:35,174
好吧 耶魯
Okay. Yale?

76
00:03:35,242 --> 00:03:36,875
-對 -繼續做夢吧 兄弟
- Yeah. - Keep dreaming, buddy.

77
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:39,778
有什麼發現 Palmer
What do you got, Palmer?

78
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:41,180
除了斷掉的脖子
Well, other than the broken neck,

79
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:42,526
沒有其他外在傷痕
there's no outward signs of trauma.

80
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,016
-Torres探員 -有死亡時間嗎
- Agent Torres. - You have time of death?

81
00:03:44,084 --> 00:03:45,517
屍體的情況顯示他
Condition of the body points to him

82
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:46,985
在水裏待了一段時間
being in the water for some time.

83
00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:48,287
我估計將近一個禮拜
I'd say close to a week.

84
00:03:48,355 --> 00:03:51,523
我無法通過指紋確認他的身份
I wasn't able to confirm his identity using fingerprints.

85
00:03:51,592 --> 00:03:53,292
孔雀魚先下手了
Yeah, the guppies got to him first.

86
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,327
這就是生命的輪回啊 紳士們
That is the circle of life, gentlemen.

87
00:03:58,232 --> 00:03:59,431
順便說一句
I mean that in the most

88
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,877
我對死者還是滿懷敬意的
respectful way possible, by the way.

89
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:02,145
我們在他口袋裏找了他的士兵證
We found his military I.D. in his pocket,

90
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:04,336
根據他制服上的姓名條
and according to the name tag on his uniform,

91
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:07,773
我們的受害者是二級軍士Richard Granger
our victim is Senior Chief Richard Granger,

92
00:04:07,842 --> 00:04:10,209
就任於國防後勤局
assigned to the Defense Logistics Agency.

93
00:04:10,277 --> 00:04:13,378
Jethro 我給屍體做了個快速檢查
Ah, Jethro, I gave the body a quick examination.

94
00:04:13,447 --> 00:04:14,613
外部並沒有
While there was no

95
00:04:14,682 --> 00:04:16,548
明顯的傷痕
outward appearance of trauma...

96
00:04:16,617 --> 00:04:17,549
脖子斷了
Neck is broken.

97
00:04:17,618 --> 00:04:19,218
已經知道了 Duck
Already got that, Duck.

98
00:04:19,286 --> 00:04:21,353
哦
Oh.

99
00:04:21,422 --> 00:04:22,888
嘿 Gibbs
Hey, Gibbs.

100
00:04:22,957 --> 00:04:24,556
我們有個大問題
We have a big problem.

101
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,059
我剛和國防後勤局通了電話
I just got off the phone with the Defense Logistics Agency,

102
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:29,828
就是二級軍士Granger工作的地方
where Senior Chief Granger worked.

103
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:31,463
知道他們為什麼沒有上報無故缺勤嗎
Any reason they didn't report him UA?

104
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:32,965
就是這個問題
That's the thing.

105
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:37,536
跟我通話的人就是二級軍士Granger
Uh, the person I spoke to was Senior Chief Granger.

106
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:38,804
他還活著
He's alive.

107
00:04:38,873 --> 00:04:41,406
那他是誰
Then who is this?

108
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:53,609
你認識他嗎
<i>Do you recognize him?</i>

109
00:04:53,677 --> 00:04:55,043
天呐
My God.

110
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:56,218
不認識 他是誰
No. Who is he?

111
00:04:56,242 --> 00:04:57,780
我們也想知道
That's what we want to know.

112
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:00,148
他是怎麼拿到你的軍士證和制服的
How'd he get your military I.D. and your uniform?

113
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,728
我的公寓上周被非法闖入了
My apartment was broken into last week,

114
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:03,151
我的一些裝備被偷
and some of my gear was stolen.

115
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,387
我填了警方報告 但是沒有回音
I filed a police report, but nothing came of it.

116
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:07,389
知道為什麼有人想
Any idea why someone would want

117
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,891
假扮你嗎 Granger軍士
to impersonate you, Chief Granger?

118
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,126
毫無頭緒
Not a clue.

119
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:13,462
我是後勤倉庫的人事員
I'm a personnel clerk in a logistics depot.

120
00:05:13,531 --> 00:05:15,130
不是個搶手的工作
Not exactly a sexy job,

121
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,279
除非你迷戀彩色編碼組織圖
unless you're into color-coded organizational charts.

122
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,403
稍等
Hold on.

123
00:05:21,472 --> 00:05:23,672
我需要保護嗎
Do I need protection or something?

124
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,374
假扮我的人被殺了
A guy pretending to be me was killed.

125
00:05:25,442 --> 00:05:27,509
這是我被盯上了的意思嗎
Does that mean I'm being targeted?

126
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:29,011
誰告訴你他被殺了
Who said he was killed?

127
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,713
沒多少人是因為自然原因死在波托馬克河的
Not many people end up in the Potomac from natural causes.

128
00:05:31,782 --> 00:05:32,948
呃
Mm.

129
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:44,059
噢
Oh.

130
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:46,194
很抱歉 醫生
I am so sorry, Doctor. I...

131
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,263
我打算把我的東西都收走
I meant to clear all my stuff out of here

132
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:50,332
既然你已經全職回歸NCIS了
now that you're back here at NCIS full-time.

133
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:51,934
-Palmer醫生 -我知道 我知道
- Dr. Palmer. - I know, I know.

134
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:56,438
一個整齊的工作室才是高效率的工作室
An organized workspace is an efficient workspace.

135
00:05:56,507 --> 00:06:00,008
是的 你說得沒錯 但我只是想評價下你的畫
Yes, it is, but I was about to commend you on this drawing.

136
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:02,945
-哦 是嗎 -是的 細節驚人
- Oh, really? - Yes, amazing detail.

137
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:05,080
我特別喜歡你
I particularly like the way you've drawn

138
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:08,717
畫上下腔靜脈的方式
the superior and inferior vena cava.

139
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,919
看來你拿著畫筆跟拿著手術刀
It seems you are as skillful with a pencil

140
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:12,721
一樣的靈巧熟練
as you are with a scalpel.

141
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,391
希望我不會把兩者混淆 那就糟了
Hopefully, I don't get the two confused. That could get messy.

142
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:21,029
沒錯
Right.

143
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:22,731
你回來真好 醫生
It's good to have you back here, Doctor.

144
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,578
你不在這 感覺都不一樣了
Things weren't the same around here without you.

145
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:26,902
我的圖書之旅倒是個令人愉悅的改變
Yeah, it's a welcome change from my book tour.

146
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:30,305
嗨 Ducky 你打電話了 -是的 我們的檢查結果是
Hey, Ducky. You rang? Yeah, our examination

147
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:32,407
正確的 死因是脊椎骨
was correct-- the cause of death

148
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,710
C3關節的骨折
was a fracture to the C3 vertebra.

149
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:36,745
但骨折不是因為墜入水中
But it wasn't from the fall into the water.

150
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:38,380
受害人在那之前就死了
The victim was dead beforehand.

151
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:39,449
所以不是自殺？
So not a suicide?

152
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:41,650
除非他能先把自己脖子
Not unless he broke his own neck

153
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:43,952
扭斷再讓自己翻滾到水裏去
and then somehow managed to roll himself into the water.

154
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:47,823
折斷自己脖子然後自己再翻滾入水
Broke his own neck and rolled himself into the water?

155
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:50,459
你知道嗎 我還沒寫過這種故事呢
You know, I don't have a story for that one.

156
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:55,597
噢 這倒是新鮮
Oh, that's never happened before.

157
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,899
我這會兒非常不舒服
I'm very uncomfortable right now.

158
00:06:57,968 --> 00:06:59,901
哦 我也是
Oh, so am I.

159
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,069
請求繼續進行
Permission to proceed?

160
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:02,471
批准了
Granted.

161
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:04,172
好的 在我們的檢查過程中
All right, during our examination,

162
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:06,575
我們發現受害人的腿部有一根
we found a metal rod in the victim's leg

163
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:08,010
之前手術放入的金屬杆
from a previous surgery.

164
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:09,678
我在系統裏查了下序列號
I ran the serial number in the system,

165
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:11,113
有一個匹配的
came up with a hit.

166
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,448
-那麼受害人是誰 -來見過受害人
- So who's our victim? <i>- Meet our victim</i>

167
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,685
冒牌海軍 Wesley Moore 他31歲了
and Navy impersonator, Wesley Moore. He's 31.

168
00:07:16,754 --> 00:07:18,654
曾是自由網絡系統工程師
He's a freelance cyber systems engineer.

169
00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:20,989
未婚 無子女 無親屬
Unmarried, no kids, no next of kin,

170
00:07:21,058 --> 00:07:22,858
這就解釋了為什麼
which explains why he was missing for a week

171
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:25,427
他失蹤了一周也沒人報警 -犯罪記錄呢
and no one reported it. - Criminal record?

172
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:28,263
除了一些學生貸款延遲返還 這人沒什麼問題
Other than a few late student loan payments, this guy's clean.

173
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:30,076
是的 Moore在八年前因為腿部受傷
Yeah, Moore had a brief stint in the military

174
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,767
離開海軍候補軍官學校之前
eight years ago before washing out

175
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:34,169
之前曾在軍中短暫服役
of Marine Officer Candidate School after a leg injury.

176
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:35,682
他遇害的那晚有什麼行動嗎
What about his movements the night he was killed?

177
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,673
我們根據Moore從高級軍士長Granger
We tracked Moore's steps with the I.D. he stole

178
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:39,007
那裏偷到的證件追蹤他的足跡
from Senior Chief Granger.

179
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:40,609
他用證件獲取了
He used it to gain access

180
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:42,277
進入國防部後勤署的權限
to the Defense Logistics Agency.

181
00:07:42,346 --> 00:07:43,979
大門的安保鏡頭捕捉到
And security cameras at the gate

182
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:45,814
他的車在上周三
captured his vehicle entering the premises

183
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,383
晚上九點進入了後勤署
at 2100 hours last Wednesday.

184
00:07:48,452 --> 00:07:49,718
是的 他兩個小時後離開了
Yeah, he exited two hours later.

185
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:50,864
之後  Moore去向不明
After that, Moore fell off the grid.

186
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,287
對車的通緝令已經發出去了
BOLO's already out on the car.

187
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:55,123
他為什麼要溜進國防部後勤署呢
Why'd he sneak into the DLA?

188
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:57,392
為了黑進國防部的保密通信
To hack into the DoD's classified message traffic.

189
00:07:57,461 --> 00:07:59,061
我在查他獲取了哪些信息
I'm working on what he accessed,

190
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:00,840
但是海外軍隊部署相關的
but sensitive data on troops' movements overseas

191
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:02,564
敏感信息可能已經泄露了
might have been compromised.

192
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:05,133
而且我們手上有一個嚴重的安全漏洞
And we got a serious security breach on our hands.

193
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:06,635
是 我是Gibbs
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

194
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:08,181
Hi Gibbs 你有時間嗎
Hi, Gibbs. Do you have a minute?

195
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:09,371
好的 馬上下去
Yeah, be right down.

196
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,373
找出Moore在追蹤什麼
Find out what Moore was after.

197
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:20,348
水流情況
Water currents?

198
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,651
是的 我還以為一個造船的人
Yeah, you'd think a person who builds boats

199
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,554
會覺得潮汐變化十分美妙
would find tide shifts more fascinating.

200
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:26,702
一條線索更能吸引我
A lead would be fascinating.

201
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,256
這就是線索
This is the lead.

202
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:30,158
怎麼 你以為我讓你下來
What, did you think I invited you down here

203
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:33,462
就是為了有趣的無聲交流嗎
for some riveting nonverbal conversation?

204
00:08:34,565 --> 00:08:36,598
好吧 呃 繼續
Okay, uh, moving on.

205
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:39,501
我在分析過去六天的海岸
So, I have been analyzing the coastal tide patterns

206
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,269
潮汐模式
for the past six days,

207
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:44,673
從Moore屍體沖上岸的地方倒推
working backwards from where Wesley Moore's body washed up

208
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:47,709
看他的屍體從哪裏入水的
to determine where his body first entered the water.

209
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,678
-縮小搜查範圍 -嘿
- Narrowed down the search grid. - Hey!

210
00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:52,180
現在我們終於合拍了
Now we're on the same wavelength.

211
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:53,749
好吧
Okay.

212
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:58,553
但你不喜歡雙關 好的 很高興知道這點
And not a fan of puns. Okay, um, good to know.

213
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:01,156
好吧 如果我的計算是正確的
Okay, if my calculations are correct,

214
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:02,491
Moore的屍體是在
Moore's body was dumped

215
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,595
距北部舊城附近海岸線兩英裏的範圍內
somewhere within a two-mile stretch of shoreline near...

216
00:09:06,663 --> 00:09:07,963
被拋下水的
North Old Town.

217
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:12,367
呃 Gibbs 我有一些發現了
Uh, Gibbs, I've got something.

218
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:15,570
Wesley Moore的郵件和通話記錄表明
Wesley Moore's e-mail and phone records indicate

219
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,974
他接到了一位駐紮在阿富汗喀布爾的
he received several messages from Captain Alicia Voit,

220
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:22,210
Alicia Voit上尉的一些信息
a Marine stationed in Kabul, Afghanistan.

221
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,912
在他們兩周前的
And in their last correspondence,

222
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,481
最後一次通信中 Voit給Moore發了一封
two weeks ago, Voit e-mailed Moore

223
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,284
包含12名死亡軍人姓名的電子郵件
the names of 12 dead Marines.

224
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:30,754
別告訴我又是一個刺殺清單
Please tell me this is not another hit list.

225
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,387
不是
No.

226
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:33,121
不是那樣 那些軍人在Voit
Not so much. All of those Marines died

227
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,757
發郵件之前就死亡了
prior to Voit's message being sent.

228
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,225
她為什麼把死亡軍人的
Why would she message a list

229
00:09:37,294 --> 00:09:39,227
名單發給Moore呢
of deceased Marines' names to Moore?

230
00:09:39,296 --> 00:09:40,595
聯系喀布爾的基地
Contact the base in Kabul.

231
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:44,099
-在MTAC裏接通Voit -呃 Gibbs
- Get Voit on MTAC. - Uh, Gibbs,

232
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,567
這沒法實現
that's impossible.

233

They were definitely more than that.

253
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,545
我是說 根據他們的郵件往來和發的社交網站來看
I mean, by their e-mails and social media posts,

254
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:32,180
沒錯 他們肯定關系不一般

呣 我讀過那些郵件

Right or left, face!

275
00:11:43,138 --> 00:11:46,239
向前進
Forward march!

276
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:55,682
你應該就是Gibbs探員了
You must be Agent Gibbs.

277
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,518
總部通知我們等你來 我是Park上校
HQ said to expect you. Colonel Park.

278
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:01,354
你是被指派給Voit上尉的護衛嗎
You're the Marine escort assigned to Captain Voit?

279
00:12:01,423 --> 00:12:04,957
是的 我的任務是最後一次送她回家
Affirmative. I am tasked with her final transit home.

280
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:07,927
上尉的遺體一小時內應該就會被放行
The captain's remains should be released within the hour.

281
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:11,531
出什麼問題了嗎
Something wrong?

282
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:13,110
上校不常被分派這類任務吧
Colonels aren't usually assigned these details.

283
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:14,467
軍人以服從命令為天職
A Marine goes where he's needed,

284
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:16,035
Gibbs探員
Agent Gibbs.

285
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:18,204
你的目的地是哪裏
What's your destination?

286
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:21,074
新澤西州的Strathmere  Voit上尉的家鄉
Strathmere, New Jersey. Captain Voit's hometown.

287
00:12:21,142 --> 00:12:24,210
我們會在10點鍾出發
Our transport will be departing at 1000 hours.

288
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,713
上校 恐怕你們的出發要推遲了
Colonel, I'm afraid there's going to be a delay.

289
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:29,415
-為什麼 -Voit上尉現在是我們正在調查的
- Excuse me? - Captain Voit

290
00:12:29,484 --> 00:12:31,884
一起謀殺案調的一部分了
is now part of an active murder investigation.

291
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:36,923
謀殺調查
Murder investigation?

292
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,469
這件事沒人告訴過我
I wasn't informed of that.

293
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:39,693
她的遺體需要送到
Her remains are to be brought

294
00:12:39,694 --> 00:12:42,328
NCIS 直到我們找到更多的答案
to NCIS until we have more answers.

295
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:46,332
我能理解
I understand your...

296
00:12:46,401 --> 00:12:49,168
你的境遇 Gibbs探員
your situation, Agent Gibbs,

297
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:51,037
但我不能允許此事發生
but I cannot allow that.

298
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,073
這不是請求 上校
It's not a request, Colonel.

299
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:57,443
我的任務是把上尉送回家
It's my duty to get the captain home

300
00:12:57,512 --> 00:12:59,645
讓她在兩天之內得到安息
to be laid to rest in two days.

301
00:12:59,714 --> 00:13:02,115
而我也會盡我所能確保此事按期執行
And I'll do everything I can to ensure that happens.

302
00:13:02,183 --> 00:13:04,517
無意冒犯 但是我覺得這並不夠
With all due respect, that's not good enough for me.

303
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:06,953
上校 Voit上尉的死可能與
Colonel, there's a possibility that Captain Voit's death

304
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:09,021
另一起謀殺案有關
is connected to another murder case.

305
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,124
我們需要給兩名受害者
We owe it to both victims

306
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:12,825
找出真相
to find out the truth.

307
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:19,065
這一點上我們的追求是一致的
That is something we do agree on.

308
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:23,636
好吧
All right.

309
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:25,838
但是我要跟你一起
But I'm going with you.

310
00:13:25,907 --> 00:13:28,541
別指望我能離開上尉半步
Don't expect me to leave the captain's side.

311
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,842
明白
Understood.

312
00:13:36,017 --> 00:13:37,817
這是什麼泥啊
What kind of mud is this?

313
00:13:37,886 --> 00:13:39,819
感覺就像流沙
It feels like quicksand.

314
00:13:39,888 --> 00:13:42,688
你確定搜索範圍是在這裏嗎
Are you sure this is the right search grid?

315
00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:45,069
非常確定 Moore的屍體一定是在 大概 這附近
Oh, yeah, positive. Moore's body had to have entered the water,

316
00:13:45,093 --> 00:13:47,026
掉進了水裏
like, around here.

317
00:13:47,095 --> 00:13:50,496
哦 我天 哦 我的天呐
Oh, my... oh, my... oh, my God! Oh, my God!

318
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:52,365
哦 天呐 你看到那些蒼蠅有多大了嗎
Oh, my God, did you see the size of that fly?

319
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:55,001
看起來就像史前生物
It was, like, prehistoric.

320
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:58,504
呃 就把這當成你成為外勤探員的速成課程
Uh, consider this your crash course on field agent work.

321
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:00,618
是啊 被油汙覆蓋 還要
Yeah, okay, well, getting covered in grime and, like,

322
00:14:00,642 --> 00:14:04,010
被蒼蠅吃掉 並不是很符合你說的
eaten by flies isn't exactly the high-octane experience

323
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:06,212
-及其新穎的體驗啊 -時間還長著呢 姐們兒
- you promised. - The day's young, sister.

324
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:08,147
好吧 但是如果我看見哪怕一條蛇 我就...
Fine, but if I see one snake, I am...

325
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:09,916
我就離開這裏
I'm out of here.

326
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:11,462
等等 蛇嗎 你是在 等一下 你什麼意思 有蛇嗎
Wait, snake? What are you... Wait, what do you mean, snake?

327
00:14:11,486 --> 00:14:12,663
你說蛇是什麼意思
What are you talking about, snakes?

328
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:14,921
哦 沒錯 它們在沼澤系統裏繁衍生息
Oh, yeah. They thrive in swampy ecosystems.

329
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:18,758
好了 好吧
All right, okay.

330
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:20,827
呃 繼續堅持
Well, uh... stay on it.

331
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:24,479
搞完這裏 我要 我馬上回來
Get 'er done. I'm gonna... I'll be right back.

332
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,233
在恐怖電影裏 一般說這話的人
Yeah, that's usually what someone says

333
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:28,501
馬上就會死掉
right before they're killed in a horror movie,

334
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,603
但是 我確定這完全不一樣
but yeah, I'm sure this is totally different.

335
00:14:30,672 --> 00:14:34,040
我愛我的工作 我愛我的工作 我愛我的工作
I love my job, I love my job, I love my job,

336
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:35,441
我愛我的工作 哦
I love my job. Oof!

337
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,677
嗨 夥計
Hey, man.

338
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:39,345
能跟你說句話嗎
Can I have a word?

339
00:14:40,615 --> 00:14:42,215
嗨 終於來了啊
Hey, it's about time.

340
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:44,817
整早就我一個人在這裏
Been out here on my own all morning.

341
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:49,689
怎麼 還需要我發一張請柬嗎
What, are you waiting for an invitation?

342
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:51,190
開始幹活啊
Start pulling your weight.

343
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:53,926
先把問題放一放 夥計 我是NCIS
Okay, take it down a notch, buddy. NCIS.

344
00:14:55,997 --> 00:14:58,130
抱歉 我 呃
Sorry about that. I, uh...

345
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,899
我以為你是我們的志願者呢
I thought you were one of our volunteers.

346
00:14:59,968 --> 00:15:02,401
他遲到一個半小時了
He's over an hour and a half late.

347
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,770
你是 呃 Waterway志願者協會的成員嗎
Are you with, uh, Waterway Volunteers?

348
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:06,973
呃 沒錯
Uh, yeah. That's right.

349
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,441
我花了一早晨的時間
I spent my morning covering

350
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,443
清理那條半英裏的路
a half-mile stretch that way.

351
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:12,578
怎麼回事 NCIS在這裏幹什麼
Why? What's NCIS doing out here?

352
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:15,615
Nick 我有發現了
Nick! Got something!

353
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,557
你說過Wesley Moore開著一輛什麼車來著
What kind of car did you say Wesley Moore had?

354
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:26,859
銀色福特福克斯
It's a silver Ford Focus.

355
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:36,769
不錯啊 Kasie
Not bad, Kasie.

356
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:38,838
謝謝
Thanks.

357
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:49,248
為什麼一個像Voit上尉這樣的授勳陸戰隊員
Why would a decorated Marine like Captain Voit get mixed up

358
00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:51,083
會跟Wesley Moore這樣的人混在一起呢
with somebody like Wesley Moore?

359
00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:52,952
他們並沒那麼不同 Leon
Well, they're not that different, Leon.

360
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:56,656
都在十幾歲成為孤兒 生長在社會福利機構裏的孩子
Both were orphaned as teenagers, were children of public servants

361
00:15:56,724 --> 00:15:59,692
而且都有這種純潔的為國效力的願望
and shared this pure desire to serve their country.

362
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:01,661
我們說的是同一個Moore嗎
Are we talking about the same Moore?

363
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:03,863
那個假扮成海軍水手
The one who impersonated a Navy sailor,

364
00:16:03,932 --> 00:16:05,998
闖入設防的軍事設施
who broke onto a secure military facility

365
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:08,868
黑進了機密的國防部服務器
and hacked into a confidential DoD server,

366
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:11,304
把數千美軍士兵置於危險境地的那個人嗎
putting thousands of U.S. troops at risk?

367
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:12,939
嗨 我沒說他是完美的人
Hey, I didn't say he was perfect.

368
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:14,307
這麼說就非常輕描淡寫了
Well, there's an understatement.

369
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,775
但我不相信 Moore
But I don't believe that Moore

370
00:16:15,843 --> 00:16:18,444
侵入那些文件是出於邪惡的原因
accessed those files for nefarious reasons.

371
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:20,513
他確實幫了Voit
He-he did it to help Voit.

372
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:21,714
怎麼幫的
Help how?

373
00:16:21,783 --> 00:16:23,015
Voit是在尋找答案
Voit was looking for answers.

374
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:24,361
沒錯 關於12個死掉的陸戰隊員的
Right. On the 12 dead Marines.

375
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:25,551
她知道Moore
She knew that Moore

376
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,462
能夠黑進國防部系統
could hack into DoD's system

377
00:16:27,463 --> 00:16:29,306
還不用顧忌那些繁文縟節
and cut through the governmental red tape.

378
00:16:29,307 --> 00:16:31,053
沒錯 只是這非常不合法
Yeah, in a highly illegal way.

379
00:16:31,054 --> 00:16:33,218
這意味著事情非常緊迫
Which suggests a sense of urgency.

380
00:16:33,219 --> 00:16:36,604
Voit上尉找Moore求助
Now, Captain Voit reached out to Moore

381
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:39,553
而不是去找她的指揮系統 為什麼呢
instead of going through her chain of command. Why?

382
00:16:39,554 --> 00:16:40,919
因為Voit不知道能夠相信誰
'Cause Voit didn't know who to trust.

383
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,017
沒錯
Exactly.

384
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,737
你認為他們的死是有關聯的嗎
You think their deaths are connected?

385
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:44,738
百分百確信
100%.

386
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:46,339
他們都死在了同一天
They both died the same day--

387
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:48,407
一個死在華盛頓 一個死在阿富汗
one in D.C., one in Afghanistan.

388
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:50,142
協同攻擊 對吧
Coordinated attacks, yeah?

389
00:16:50,211 --> 00:16:53,479
這一切的關鍵一定跟阿富汗那邊有關
And the key to why has to do with Afghanistan.

390
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:55,881
一般在這個時候你就會告訴我
And this is usually the time you tell me

391
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,184
你已經派人前往阿富汗了
that you've already sent a team en route.

392
00:16:58,252 --> 00:16:59,819
今早就派遣McGee和Bishop去了
Sent McGee and Bishop this morning.

393
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:01,921
他們應該隨時會到達Russell營地
They should be at Camp Russell any minute.

394
00:17:03,391 --> 00:17:06,993
別問我 我也不知道他是怎麼做到的
Don't ask me. I-I don't know how he does it, either.

395
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:23,009
已經向將軍彙報過情況了
The CG's been briefed on the situation.

396
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:25,544
他讓全力配合
He said to assist in any way possible.

397
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:26,957
-我們能跟他談談嗎 -他剛剛在跟
- When can we speak with him? - Well, he's finishing up

398
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:29,015
今天新到的陸戰特遣小隊談話
with a new Marine detachment that arrived today.

399
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,794
我以為美軍應該
Thought, uh, U.S. forces were supposed to be

400
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:32,952
-開始從阿富汗撤軍了 -確實是這麼計劃的
- withdrawing from Afghanistan. - That was the plan.

401
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:34,598
但是塔利班的襲擊一直在增加
But with the Taliban's attacks increasing

402
00:17:34,622 --> 00:17:35,933
而且他們對喀布爾的控制一直在鞏固
and their grip on Kabul strengthening,

403
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:37,456
撤軍行動已經被推遲了
the withdrawal's been put on hold.

404
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:39,358
所依你跟Aazar Atwa很熟是嗎
So you're familiar with Aazar Atwa?

405
00:17:39,427 --> 00:17:41,293
是的 女士 大概沒有陸戰隊員
Yes, ma'am. You'd be hard-pressed to find

406
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:42,695
跟他不熟
a Marine here who isn't.

407
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:44,697
他害死了很多我們的人
We've lost a lot of good people because of him.

408
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:47,099
Voit上尉只是最近的傷亡
Captain Voit was just the most recent casualty.

409
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:50,536
你可以說Atwa是這裏的頭號公敵
You could say Atwa is public enemy number one around here.

410
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:52,238
Bishop和McGee探員
Agents Bishop and McGee.

411
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:55,207
我是Braxton將軍 Russell營地的指揮官
Russell的I'm General Braxton, CG of Camp Russell.

412
00:17:55,276 --> 00:17:57,021
-非常感謝您的協助 將軍 -當然
- Appreciate the assistance, General. - Of course.

413
00:17:57,045 --> 00:17:58,644
Voit上尉是我們自己人
Captain Voit was one of our own.

414
00:17:58,713 --> 00:18:00,479
我們希望能給她伸張正義
We want her to have justice.

415
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:03,282
看來你們來得正是時候 剛好可以目睹我們伸張正義
And it looks like you both have arrived just in time to see it.

416
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:04,483
這怎麼說
How's that?

417
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:06,052
我從我們的巡邏隊得到消息
I received word from our patrol

418
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,965
他們在東北扇區發現了一個疑似塔利班安全屋
in the northeast sector who were conducting a raid

419
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:09,989
並進行了突襲
of a suspected Taliban safe house.

420
00:18:10,058 --> 00:18:12,391
-他們找到武器藏匿地點了嗎 -比這更好
- Did they find the weapons cache? - Better.

421
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,994
他們找到了Aazar Atwa
They found Aazar Atwa.

422
00:18:15,063 --> 00:18:16,495
Atwa現在在哪呢
Wh-Where's Atwa now?

423
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:18,831
正在返回我們基地的路上 有重兵把守
En route back to our base, under heavy guard.

424
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,301
你們對Voit上尉的死有疑問嗎
You have questions about Captain Voit's death?

425
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,290
你們很快就有機會面對面地詢問
You'll soon get the chance to question her killer

426
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:25,504
殺害她的凶手了
face-to-face.

427
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:43,776
你確定不需要我做什麼嗎 上校
Are you sure there's nothing I can get for you, Colonel?

428
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:46,312
不 謝謝你 我很好
No. Thank you. I'm fine.

429
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,015
你是否介意我問一下 呃 包裏是什麼
Do you mind me asking what's, uh... what's in the bag?

430
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:53,552
Voit上尉的私人物品
Contains Captain Voit's personal effects.

431
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:56,355
啊 是啊 我忍不住注意到
Ah. Yeah, I couldn't help but notice that...

432
00:18:56,424 --> 00:18:58,958
你一分一秒都不讓它離開你的視線
you won't let it out of your sight, even for a second.

433
00:18:59,026 --> 00:19:00,793
根據國防部規定
Per DoD regulations,

434
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:03,028
逝去軍人的私人物品
a fallen service member's personal effects

435
00:19:03,097 --> 00:19:05,898
應當全程由護送者守護
shall remain in the escort's possession at all times

436
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:08,634
直到送達親人手中
until directly delivered to the next of kin.

437
00:19:08,703 --> 00:19:10,903
嗯
Mm-hmm.

438
00:19:10,972 --> 00:19:14,006
要知道 對陸戰隊員而言 我想不出
You know, I can't imagine a more difficult detail for a Marine

439
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:18,811
會有比護送逝去的兄弟姐妹回家 更難受的任務了
to be assigned than escorting a fallen brother or sister home.

440
00:19:20,715 --> 00:19:23,749
我想你們的工作跟這相比也沒什麼不同 醫生
I suspect your job is not much different, Doctor.

441
00:19:23,818 --> 00:19:28,554
是啊 會有...有時會有一些內心的掙紮
Yeah. It's a, uh... it's a struggle at times.

442
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:30,556
但是當我知道我們在幫忙提供一些結論
But I take comfort in knowing that we're helping

443
00:19:30,624 --> 00:19:32,324
這會讓我內心舒服一些
to provide with some closure.

444
00:19:33,394 --> 00:19:35,394
我內心舒適與否無關緊要
My comfort is inconsequential.

445
00:19:36,731 --> 00:19:38,075
那些為國家
Those that make the ultimate sacrifice

446
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:39,398
犧牲一切的人
for this country

447
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:41,333
理應載著榮譽返回家中
deserve to be brought home with honor.

448
00:19:43,137 --> 00:19:45,237
Duck 有什麼發現
Duck, what do we know?

449
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:47,239
Voit上尉的檢查
An examination of Captain Voit

450
00:19:47,308 --> 00:19:49,441
沒有什麼結果
could not be performed since

451
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,044
因為要舉行葬禮 她的屍體被處理過了
she has already been processed for burial.

452
00:19:52,113 --> 00:19:55,280
但是Kabul和Dover的記錄
But the records from Kabul and Dover

453
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:56,849
十分詳細
are very thorough.

454
00:19:56,917 --> 00:20:00,085
上尉先被兩顆子彈擊中胸部
The captain was first struck with two bullets to the chest.

455
00:20:00,154 --> 00:20:01,887
盡管她嚴重受傷
Uh, despite her grave condition,

456
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:04,456
但在第三次致命的頭部打擊前
she managed to take out four insurgents

457
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:07,960
她成功地擊敗四名恐怖分子
before the third and fatal blow to the head.

458
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:09,094
她從沒放棄
She never gave up.

459
00:20:09,163 --> 00:20:11,430
這就是陸戰隊員
That's a Marine.

460
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:14,967
好了 夠了
Okay. We are done here.

461
00:20:15,036 --> 00:20:16,969
-上校 -我遵守了你的要求
- Colonel? - I complied with your request,

462
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,205
Gibbs探員 我同意你將Voit上尉帶到這裏來
Agent Gibbs. I allowed you to bring Captain Voit here,

463
00:20:20,274 --> 00:20:21,974
來反駁我的判斷
against my better judgment.

464
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:24,443
你的法醫剛才說
As your doctors have just pointed out,

465
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:26,378
她對你們來說已經沒有用了
she is of no further use to you.

466
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:28,781
把她的遺物給我 讓我
Release her remains, and allow me

467
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:30,482
完成我的任務
to finish my mission.

468
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:32,317
證物還在處理中
Evidence is still being processed.

469
00:20:32,386 --> 00:20:33,919
調查還沒結束
Our investigation isn't over.

470
00:20:33,988 --> 00:20:35,954
但我的合作結束了
But my cooperation is.

471
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:38,657
你們兩位單獨談談吧
W-We'll give you two a moment.

472
00:20:43,731 --> 00:20:45,664
-這是什麼 -備忘錄
- What's this? - A memo,

473
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:47,399
來自於國防部長
from the Secretary of Defense,

474
00:20:47,468 --> 00:20:49,268
以確保你的配合
ensuring your full cooperation.

475
00:20:49,336 --> 00:20:51,270
解釋下為什麼上尉在阿富汗的時候
Explain to me how the captain can be involved

476
00:20:51,338 --> 00:20:54,006
會卷入一場美國的謀殺案
in a murder in the States when she was in Afghanistan.

477
00:20:54,075 --> 00:20:55,908
這說不通
This makes no sense.

478
00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:57,709
我在盡我的職責
I'm doing my job!

479
00:20:59,313 --> 00:21:01,346
我以為你是名陸戰隊員 Gibbs
I thought you were a Marine, Gibbs.

480
00:21:01,415 --> 00:21:05,117
你若是 就把她送回去
If you were, you'd have her back.

481
00:21:05,186 --> 00:21:09,188
她的葬禮將在36小時後舉行
Her burial is in 36 hours.

482
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:11,056
我會把她送到那裏的
I will get her there.

483
00:21:29,677 --> 00:21:31,210
嘿 Kasie
Hey, Kasie.

484
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:32,511
怎麼樣
How you doing?

485
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,180
情緒範圍一到十嗎
On a scale of one to ten?

486
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:36,281
是負數
We're in the negatives.

487
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,350
-哇 -你說說
- Whoa. - Yeah, tell me about it.

488
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:41,153
我想成為名外勤特工 結果卻被咬了
I tried being a field agent, and it bit me.

489
00:21:41,222 --> 00:21:42,488
你看看
Look at me.

490
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:44,523
就像個連接點圖
It's like a connect-the-dots sheet.

491
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:48,393
我沒在笑
I'm not really laughing.

492
00:21:48,462 --> 00:21:50,462
好吧 既然工作是少有的幾件能讓我
Okay, well, since work is one of the only things

493
00:21:50,531 --> 00:21:52,564
忘記癢的事
distracting me from the urge to itch,

494
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:54,466
我要開始了
I'm just gonna jump right in.

495
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:57,402
我在Wesley Moore的車上沒有發現任何有用的指紋
I didn't find any usable prints in Wesley Moore's car,

496
00:21:57,471 --> 00:22:00,405
但我在損壞的後車身上有發現
but I hit the jackpot with the rear body damage.

497
00:22:00,474 --> 00:22:02,341
看下這個
Check this out.

498
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:04,343
這是Moore在他被殺的那晚
This is a surveillance image

499
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:06,311
離開國防後勤局的
of Moore leaving the DLA

500
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,460
監控錄像 注意到了什麼嗎
on the night that he was killed. You notice anything?

501
00:22:11,652 --> 00:22:14,219
-尾燈和擋板完好無損 -對
- Taillight and fender are intact. - Yeah.

502
00:22:14,288 --> 00:22:16,755
說明這輛車是在他死前那晚的
Meaning this vehicle was damaged later that night,

503
00:22:16,824 --> 00:22:18,490
晚些時候損壞的
before he was killed.

504
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,570
所以 如果他被盯上了 凶手一定
So, if he was being tailed, the killer must have, uh,

505
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:23,162
撞上擋板讓Moore下車
caused a fender bender to get Moore out of the car.

506
00:22:24,598 --> 00:22:25,998
所以我得到了第二份油漆的信息
So I pulled a second paint profile

507
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:28,200
是剛說的凶手的車 哇
of the killer's car in question. Whoo!

508
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:30,836
想試著五倍速說完
Try saying that five times fast.

509
00:22:30,905 --> 00:22:34,273
是有金屬底漆的紅漆
And it is a lacquer-based red with a metallic base coat.

510
00:22:34,341 --> 00:22:36,241
符合這樣的車數不過來
Okay, hundreds of cars match that.

511
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,410
實際上 因為它是生產中最常用的
Actually, since it's one of the most used

512
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:40,345
油漆類型之一
paint types in production,

513
00:22:40,414 --> 00:22:42,714
數量就更加多了
the number's more in the thousands.

514
00:22:42,783 --> 00:22:44,394
你看我們該怎麼縮小嫌犯範圍
How do you suggest we narrow down our suspects?

515
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:46,685
靠堅持不懈的努力 聰明才智
Well, with, uh, persistence, diligence,

516
00:22:46,754 --> 00:22:48,387
結合電腦技術
and our combined computer skills.

517
00:22:48,455 --> 00:22:52,191
結合嗎 我嗎 Bishop 還是McGee
Combined? What am I, Bishop or McGee?

518
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:53,458
不可能 我就是個
No, I'm more of, like,

519
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:55,127
運動份子
a physical specimen, man, you know?

520
00:22:55,196 --> 00:22:56,528
打架 恐嚇別人
You know, punching, intimidating,

521
00:22:56,597 --> 00:22:58,197
-才是符合我做的事 -好吧
- that's more my thing. - Mm, okay.

522
00:22:58,265 --> 00:23:01,633
我替你穿過了那片沼澤 Nicholas
I trekked through a swamp for you, Nicholas.

523
00:23:01,702 --> 00:23:04,636
所以 你要是不替我擔保 就會在
So, if you bail on me now, you're just gonna find

524
00:23:04,705 --> 00:23:07,940
辦公桌抽屜裏發現會動的銅頭蛇
a slithering copperhead snake in your desk drawer.

525
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:10,309
或者在你的床上
Ooh, or in your bed.

526
00:23:11,545 --> 00:23:13,478
或者更糟
Or worse.

527
00:23:16,217 --> 00:23:18,650
只有我
Is it just me,

528
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:21,119
-感覺到 -太過容易了嗎
- or does this feel... - Too easy?

529
00:23:21,188 --> 00:23:22,621
不僅是你有這種感覺
No, it's not just you.

530
00:23:29,396 --> 00:23:32,831
作為被捕的恐怖分子他看上去很自在
He looks pretty carefree for a captured terrorist.

531
00:23:35,302 --> 00:23:36,435
你來翻譯嗎
You gonna translate?

532
00:23:36,503 --> 00:23:39,504
不 我不需要
No. I don't need to,

533
00:23:39,573 --> 00:23:41,673
因為他能聽得懂
'cause he can understand us just fine.

534
00:23:41,742 --> 00:23:43,342
是嗎
Isn't that right?

535
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,577
是的 我能聽懂
Yes, I can.

536
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:49,581
不好意思 什麼東西逗樂你了嗎
Sorry, does something amuse you?

537
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,850
所有的這些
This. All of it.

538
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,119
給你看看我不覺得有趣的東西
Well, let me show you what I don't find funny.

539

543
00:24:04,064 --> 00:24:05,163
還要繼續嗎
Should I continue?

544
00:24:05,232 --> 00:24:07,043
-這些名字對我來說沒什麼意義 -它們應該有
- Those names mean nothing to me. - Well, they should.

545
00:24:07,067 --> 00:24:09,107
這些是你殺死的陸戰隊員的名字
They're the names of some of the Marines you killed.

546
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,404
再說一遍
Again...

547
00:24:13,774 --> 00:24:15,140
它們對我來說沒有什麼意義
...they mean nothing to me.

548
00:24:15,209 --> 00:24:16,975
所以你不否認你殺了他們
So you don't deny it?

549
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:18,477
為什麼要否認值得我驕傲的事呢
Why deny what I'm proud of?

550
00:24:18,545 --> 00:24:22,547
要是你這麼驕傲 跟我們說一下她
Well, if you're so proud, tell us about her.

551
00:24:22,616 --> 00:24:24,816
她是上周你襲擊的運輸隊成員之一
She was part of the convoy you hit last week.

552
00:24:24,885 --> 00:24:26,318
我記得
I remember.

553
00:24:26,387 --> 00:24:28,620
那天天氣晴朗
The sky was so clear that day.

554
00:24:28,689 --> 00:24:31,390
我們從很遠就能看到他們的車子
We could see their vehicle from miles away,

555
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:33,325
她真是不幸
unfortunately for her.

556
00:24:33,394 --> 00:24:35,193
那也不容易吧
Wasn't that easy.

557
00:24:35,262 --> 00:24:36,828
Voit上尉殺了你的四個手下
Captain Voit killed four of your men

558
00:24:36,897 --> 00:24:38,297
在你殺死她前
before you could finish her off.

559
00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:40,132
我猜你低估了她
Guess you underestimated her.

560
00:24:41,535 --> 00:24:44,069
我們要繼續這場遊戲嗎
Are we going to continue this game,

561
00:24:44,138 --> 00:24:47,039
還是想知道我襲擊的真相
or do you want to know the truth about my attacks?

562
00:24:47,107 --> 00:24:49,708
告訴我們
Tell us.

563
00:24:52,112 --> 00:24:54,546
你們要給我想要的
Only if I get something in return.

564
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:57,182
自由
My freedom.

565
00:24:57,251 --> 00:24:58,717
真新奇
How original.

566
00:24:58,786 --> 00:25:01,653
你是個恐怖分子 殺了13名陸戰隊員
You're a terrorist who killed 13 U.S. Marines.

567
00:25:01,722 --> 00:25:03,055
希望你能好好享受鐐銬
Hope you enjoy those shackles,

568
00:25:03,123 --> 00:25:04,723
因為你要在監獄裏
'cause you're gonna be living in a cell

569
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:07,392
度過餘生了 我們走
for the rest of your life. Let's go.

570
00:25:10,898 --> 00:25:12,998
我從一個美國人那裏
I had help,

571
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:14,733
得到了幫助
from an American.

572
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:19,671
引起你們的注意了嗎
Now do I have your attention?

573
00:25:27,247 --> 00:25:30,082
你和美國人一起合作嗎
You were working with an American?

574
00:25:31,285 --> 00:25:32,285
證明下
Prove it.

575
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,786
用我的自由來換
My freedom for a traitor

576
00:25:34,855 --> 00:25:37,389
背叛國家的叛徒
who's been betraying your country.

577
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:39,891
一場公平的交易
Fair trade,

578
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,361
不覺得嗎
don't you think?

579
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,898
Atwa瘋了
Atwa's out of his damn mind.

580
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:49,568
美國政府不會和恐怖分子做交易
The U.S. government will not d a deal with a known terrorist.

581
00:25:49,636 --> 00:25:52,371
我明白 主任 但是Atwa說
I understand, Director, but Atwa claims

582
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:54,317
他一直在和一個內部的美國人合作
he's been working with an American on the inside.

583
00:25:54,341 --> 00:25:55,474
Atwa很聰明
Atwa's smart.

584
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:57,142
他會說出我們想要聽到的東西
He'll say whatever we want to hear

585
00:25:57,211 --> 00:25:58,777
只要能確保他被釋放
if it means securing his release.

586
00:25:58,846 --> 00:26:01,580
我們不能保證他給我們的是真的
We have no guarantee what he gives us is the truth.

587
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:04,116
通常來說 Sloane 我會同意你說的
Yes, and normally, Sloane, I would agree with you,

588
00:26:04,184 --> 00:26:07,452
但這次我不同意 我覺得他不像在說謊
but not this time. I-I really don't think he's bluffing.

589
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:08,754
Bishop 發現了些什麼
Bishop, what do you know?

590
00:26:08,822 --> 00:26:11,123
我以前也面對過像Atwa這樣的恐怖分子
Look, I-I've dealt with insurgents like Atwa before.

591
00:26:11,191 --> 00:26:13,959
他不焦慮 緊張 反複無常
He-he's not agitated, nervous or volatile.

592
00:26:14,027 --> 00:26:15,894
實際上 他很自信
He is, in fact, assured,

593
00:26:15,963 --> 00:26:18,430
就像是知道自己的優勢
like someone who knows that they have the advantage.

594
00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:20,265
那12個死去了的陸戰隊員呢
12 dead Marines.

595
00:26:20,334 --> 00:26:21,633
他們怎麼了
What about them?

596
00:26:21,702 --> 00:26:23,402
塔利班襲擊了運輸隊
Transports were hit by the Taliban.

597
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,837
在最後時刻運輸路線改變了
Convoy routes are changed at the last minute.

598
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:27,072
是的
Yeah.

599
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:28,351
一定有人把他們的行動
Someone had to be directly relaying

600
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:29,641
直接告訴了Atwa
their movements to Atwa.

601
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,943
即使是真的 也無法抹去
Well, even if that's true, it doesn't erase the fact

602
00:26:32,012 --> 00:26:35,180
Atwa殺死那些隊員的事實
that Atwa's caused the deaths of multiple troops.

603
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:36,648
Leon 他想要對話
He wants to talk, Leon.

604
00:26:36,717 --> 00:26:39,618
那就讓他說 但不會有交易的
Well, then get him to talk, but he's not getting a deal.

605
00:26:39,686 --> 00:26:41,453
明白了嗎
Is that clear?

606
00:26:41,522 --> 00:26:43,989
明白了 主任
Uh, yes, yes, Director.

607
00:26:44,057 --> 00:26:45,690
Gibbs
Gibbs?

608
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,726
他的朋友不需要知道
His friends don't need to know that.

609
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,766
上校 太晚了
Colonel, it's late.

610
00:26:54,835 --> 00:26:57,669
在宿舍給你准備了個房間
Got a room waiting for you at the BOQ.

611
00:26:57,738 --> 00:27:00,105
這沒必要 我很好
That won't be necessary. I'm doing fine.

612
00:27:00,174 --> 00:27:01,940
國防部護送人員可以
DoD escorts are permitted

613
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:05,277
將遺體留在
to leave service members' remains

614
00:27:05,345 --> 00:27:07,112
安全的地方
at a secure location.

615
00:27:07,181 --> 00:27:09,314
我知道規章
I know what the regulations say.

616
00:27:09,383 --> 00:27:12,484
我只是覺得只留下上尉一個人在這裏不好
I just don't feel right leaving the captain alone.

617
00:27:12,553 --> 00:27:15,086
知道你會這麼說
Yeah, figured you were gonna say something like that.

618
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,127
你在做什麼
What are you doing?

619
00:27:23,964 --> 00:27:25,630
給你搭張床
I'm getting you a cot.

620
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:28,533
-我說了 我很好 -我知道 你很好
- I told you, I'm fine. - Yeah, yeah, I know, you're fine.

621
00:27:28,602 --> 00:27:30,335
我明白
I got it, okay.

622
00:27:30,404 --> 00:27:32,070
你得睡覺
Got to sleep somewhere.

623
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:34,005
要麼這裏 要麼離開
Hey, take it or leave it.

624
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:36,274
你決定
Your call.

625
00:27:45,219 --> 00:27:46,918
我為之前說過的話
I owe you an apology

626
00:27:46,987 --> 00:27:48,887
道歉 Gibbs
for what I said earlier, Gibbs.

627
00:27:50,123 --> 00:27:52,891
我不該質疑你的忠誠
It was wrong to question your service.

628
00:27:54,928 --> 00:27:56,394
我去過那裏 上校
I've been there, Colonel.

629
00:27:56,463 --> 00:28:01,066
分配到護送任務
It is not easy

630
00:28:01,134 --> 00:28:03,768
很不容易
getting assigned an escort detail.

631
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:07,439
是啊
No.

632
00:28:07,508 --> 00:28:09,140
不容易
No, it's not.

633
00:28:11,645 --> 00:28:14,145
要是你是自願的就更加艱難了
It's even harder if you volunteered for it.

634
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:18,016
那麼明顯嗎
Was it that obvious?

635
00:28:22,356 --> 00:28:24,222
你怎麼認識Voit上尉的
How'd you know Captain Voit?

636
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:27,926
是我招募了她
I was the one who recruited her.

637
00:28:27,995 --> 00:28:32,397
十年前我遇到了Voit
Met Voit ten years ago.

638
00:28:32,466 --> 00:28:35,133
在前一個冬天她失去了雙親
She had just lost both of her parents the winter before.

639
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:36,968
她正在上大學
She was putting herself through college.

640
00:28:37,037 --> 00:28:40,639
工作認真 頭腦聰明
She was a real hard worker, and good head on her shoulders.

641
00:28:40,707 --> 00:28:43,074
是塊做陸戰隊的料
Marine material.

642
00:28:43,143 --> 00:28:45,310
我可以在
I can always tell within a...

643
00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:46,978
在見到別人的一分鍾內
within a minute of meeting somebody

644
00:28:47,047 --> 00:28:50,248
分辨出有沒有做陸戰隊員的潛質
whether they have what it takes.

645
00:28:50,317 --> 00:28:51,650
Voit具有這種潛質
Voit did.

646
00:28:53,654 --> 00:28:56,555
我讓她
I was the one

647
00:28:56,623 --> 00:28:59,424
加入軍隊
who swore her in,

648
00:28:59,493 --> 00:29:04,062
所以也應該帶她回家
so I should be the one to bring her home,

649
00:29:04,131 --> 00:29:07,899
就像我為其他人死去的隊員
just like I did for all the other

650
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:11,069
做的一樣
fallen Marines that I've recruited.

651
00:29:13,073 --> 00:29:14,439
有多少
How many?

652
00:29:14,508 --> 00:29:16,908
一個就已經夠多的了
One is too many.

653
00:29:16,977 --> 00:29:21,212
上校 他們的死不是你的責任
You're not responsible for their deaths, Colonel.


654
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:25,917
你也失去過戰友 對嗎
You've lost people, right?

655
00:29:25,986 --> 00:29:27,919
在陸戰隊的時候
As a Marine,

656
00:29:27,988 --> 00:29:29,988
當探員的時候
as an agent?

657
00:29:31,858 --> 00:29:34,259
你覺得你沒有責任嗎
Did you not feel responsible?

658
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:42,767
他們只是 只是孩子
They were just... just kids who...

659
00:29:42,836 --> 00:29:46,371
在我的引導下參了軍
joined the military under my guidance.

660
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:51,710
我每天都想著
I'll carry their deaths with me

661
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:53,778
他們的死亡
every day.

662
00:29:57,084 --> 00:29:59,117
我欠他們太多了
I owe them that much.

663
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:06,291
-我們要去哪裏 -把你轉移
- Where are we going? - Transferring you.

664
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,159
到關塔那摩 在古巴
To Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

665
00:30:08,228 --> 00:30:10,528
希望你會喜歡那裏的潮濕和孤獨
Hope you like humidity and solitary.

666
00:30:10,597 --> 00:30:12,631
這是在恐嚇我嗎
Is that supposed to frighten me?

667
00:30:12,699 --> 00:30:14,899
不是 但把你和Gibbs關在一起就是了
No, but putting you in a cell with Gibbs may.

668
00:30:14,968 --> 00:30:16,134
最後的機會 Atwa
Last chance, Atwa.

669
00:30:16,203 --> 00:30:17,836
告訴我們和你合作的美國人是誰
Tell us the American you're working with.

670
00:30:17,904 --> 00:30:20,238
-除非把我放了 -你得好好想想
- Not until I'm released. - May want to rethink that.

671
00:30:20,307 --> 00:30:22,218
我想你的同伴看到你和我們合作
I can't imagine your fellow insurgents would look favorably

672
00:30:22,242 --> 00:30:24,042
可不會開心
on you working with us.

673
00:30:24,111 --> 00:30:27,746
他們才不關心一個美國人的命運
The fate of an American isn't their concern.

674
00:30:27,814 --> 00:30:29,748
他們知道我不會背叛他們
They know I would never betray them.

675
00:30:29,816 --> 00:30:31,549
除非我們在城裏散播消息
Well, unless we spread word around town

676
00:30:31,618 --> 00:30:33,485
說你為了自由背叛了他們
that you gave them up for your freedom.

677
00:30:33,553 --> 00:30:34,919
我們可以令人信服
We can be very convincing.

678
00:30:34,988 --> 00:30:37,489
他們會認為你是個叛徒和麻煩
They'll see you as a traitor and a liability.

679
00:30:37,557 --> 00:30:39,891
沒有完美的保護
You won't last one minute outside those gates,

680
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,359
你走出監獄活不過一分鍾
not without our protection.

681
00:30:41,428 --> 00:30:42,861
所以 你要是想活著
So, if you enjoy breathing,

682
00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:44,062
我建議你
I suggest you start talking

683
00:30:44,131 --> 00:30:45,964
告訴我們那個美國聯絡人是誰
and tell us who your American contact is.

684
00:30:47,134 --> 00:30:49,567
很好
Very well.

685
00:30:49,636 --> 00:30:53,338
12個月前 我從線人那裏收到情報
12 months ago, I began receiving intelligence from a source.

686
00:31:08,363 --> 00:31:10,564
發生了什麼 McGee
What the hell happened, McGee?

687
00:31:10,632 --> 00:31:11,998
狙擊手從山上開的槍
Sniper fire from the mountains.

688
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,983
沒有人看到凶手
No one had eyes on the shooter.

689
00:31:14,052 --> 00:31:15,484
Atwa告訴了你什麼嗎
Did Atwa give you anything?

690
00:31:15,553 --> 00:31:17,486
他剛要說 就被中槍了
He was about to when the gunfire started.

691
00:31:17,555 --> 00:31:19,455
有人想要他閉嘴
Well, someone wanted to shut him up.

692
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:20,834
這說明我們中有內奸
Which means we got a mole on our hands

693
00:31:20,858 --> 00:31:21,791
他受過狙擊訓練
with advanced sniper training.

694
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:23,092
太好了
That's perfect.

695
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:25,561
轉移Atwa的消息沒有流出過Russell營地
The details of Atwa's transfer never left Camp Russell.

696
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,763
那一定是營內的人
So it had to be someone in-house.

697
00:31:27,832 --> 00:31:29,832
Bishop正在查看所有人員的個人檔案
Bishop's going through all the personnel files now.

698
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:32,468
聽著 McGee 給我找到他
Listen to me, McGee, you find him!

699
00:31:44,482 --> 00:31:47,583
我沒法再盯著屏幕了
I'm not sure I can stare at this screen much longer.

700
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:49,986
這光讓我不停地眯眼
This glare is making me squint,

701
00:31:50,054 --> 00:31:52,855
這張臉不會長皺紋
and this face doesn't do wrinkles.

702
00:31:52,924 --> 00:31:54,423
加油 大家
Come on, team.

703
00:31:54,492 --> 00:31:55,925
即便我們通宵
Sure, we pulled an all-nighter

704
00:31:55,994 --> 00:31:57,805
查交通監控 也沒找到
combing traffic-cam footage, and we're no closer

705
00:31:57,829 --> 00:32:01,264
嫌疑人 但我們在一起奮斗 不是嗎
to finding our suspect, but we're in this together, right?

706
00:32:01,332 --> 00:32:03,933
-朋友互相幫忙 -Jimmy
- Friends helping friends. - Jimmy,

707
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:05,167
閉嘴
stop talking.

708
00:32:05,236 --> 00:32:08,004
嘿 Jimmy
Hey, Jimmy.

709
00:32:08,072 --> 00:32:09,705
你什麼時候來的
When'd you get here?

710
00:32:09,774 --> 00:32:11,807
哦 天啊
Oh, boy.

711
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:14,377
早上好
The top o' the morning to you.

712
00:32:14,445 --> 00:32:18,047
我給你們帶了急需的食物
I bring much-needed sustenance.

713
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:20,716
兩杯黑咖啡
Two black coffees.

714
00:32:20,785 --> 00:32:22,885
給
There we are. And, uh,

715
00:32:22,954 --> 00:32:25,788
還有一杯大杯雙份冰摩卡
one large double mocha

716
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:28,224
加了混合奶油
frozen blend with whipping cream

717
00:32:28,293 --> 00:32:32,528
巧克力片和焦糖
and chocolate chips, and a drizzle of caramel.

718
00:32:32,597 --> 00:32:35,131
太棒了
Yes. Mm.

719
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:38,367
這個直擊我心
Now, that hits the spot.

720
00:32:38,436 --> 00:32:40,603
你這麼吃還長這樣嗎
You can eat that and still look like that?

721
00:32:42,106 --> 00:32:44,173
天啊 生活真是不公平
Man, life's not fair.

722
00:32:44,242 --> 00:32:46,208
Jimmy 你讓我反感了
Jimmy, uh, you disgust me.

723
00:32:46,277 --> 00:32:49,045
嘿 有發現
Hey... got something.

724
00:32:49,113 --> 00:32:51,914
紅色卡車符合我們的描述
Red truck matching our description.

725
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:54,417
保險杠也損壞了
Ooh, complete with front bumper damage.

726
00:32:54,485 --> 00:32:55,685
這是在哪裏拍到的
Where was this picture taken?

727
00:32:55,753 --> 00:32:57,720
攝像頭 在Moore被殺的那晚
Traffic cam, ten miles from where

728
00:32:57,789 --> 00:32:59,322
距離發現他車的地方
Moore's car was found

729
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,923
十英裏處
on the night he was killed.

730
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:02,491
這輛卡車登記在誰的名下
Who's the truck registered to?

731
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,694
Xavier Blackburn
Xavier Blackburn.

732
00:33:04,762 --> 00:33:06,395
來自Falls Church的市民
Civilian from Falls Church.

733
00:33:06,464 --> 00:33:08,564
我在沼澤地裏遇到過這家夥
Hey, I ran into this guy at the marsh.

734
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:11,067
他說他是和水路志願者一起的
He said he was with Waterway Volunteers.

735
00:33:11,135 --> 00:33:13,936
Xavier Blackburn不在他們的成員名單上
Uh, there's no Xavier Blackburn listed on their crew roster.

736
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:15,938
那麼他在沼澤地裏做什麼
Then what was he doing at the marsh?

737
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:17,973
和所有犯了罪的人做同樣的事
Doing what all guilty people do.

738
00:33:19,444 --> 00:33:21,677
掩蓋行跡
Covering his tracks.

739
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,510
你看我說得對不對
So, let me see if I got this right.

740
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,750
用自己的時間做志願服務 卻成為了謀殺嫌犯嗎
Volunteering my time makes me a murder suspect?

741
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,380
真不愧是好人難做啊
Talk about "no good deed."

742
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,920
但是Waterway志願服務隊裏
Okay, so no one at Waterway Volunteers

743
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,090
沒人聽說過你
has ever heard of you.

744
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,460
我是新人 他們一定搞丟了我的文件
I'm new. They must have lost my paperwork.

745
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,930
我們沒丟
We didn't.

746
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,030
Xavier Blackburn 33歲
"Xavier Blackburn, 33."

747
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,960
給阿靈頓一個私人軍事公司
Spent six years as a contractor

748
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,970
當了六年的承包商
for a private military firm in Arlington.

749
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,400
直到你因為行為問題
Until you were fired

750
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,370
被開除
because of behavioral issues.

751
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,040
愈演愈烈的暴力行為
"Increasingly violent outbursts

752
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,870
和公然無視協議
and blatant disregard for protocol."

753
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,540
我偶爾會跟一些目光短淺的上級
I had an occasional disagreement

754
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,910
有一些意見分歧
with a few short-sighted superiors.

755
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,510
我想你能理解
I'm sure you can relate.

756
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,380
不錯的貨車
Nice truck.

757
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:09,950
至少曾經不錯 我們追查它
At least it was. We... we tracked it down

758
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,260
查到你家附近一個汽車修理廠
to a body shop near your house.

759
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,620
你猜怎樣
And guess what.

760
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,460
你保險杠上的漆跟Wesley Moore的車相符
The paint on your bumper was a match to Wesley Moore's car.

761
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,300
Moore盜竊美國情報
Moore stole U.S. intelligence.

762
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:21,770
你們知道這個嗎
Did you know that?

763
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,100
他對國家安全是個威脅
He was a risk to national security

764
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,470
需要被阻止
and needed to be stopped.

765
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,140
Moore是在調查一起
Moore was investigating an American

766
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,970
美國人協助塔利班的事件
who was aiding the Taliban.

767
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,980
他不是叛徒 人才
He wasn't the traitor, genius.

768
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:37,110
不 你們錯了 他告訴我Moore很危險
No, you're wrong. He told me Moore was dangerous.

769
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,620
他
He?

770
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,020
他說如果我消除這個威脅
He said that if I neutralized the threat,

771
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:44,020
他就會重新雇傭我 我就能拿回我的工作了
he would reinstate me, and I would get my job back.

772
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,990
誰給你下的指示
Who gave you the order?

773
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,130
巡邏隊在5點出發
The patrol will leave at 0500 hours.

774
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,600
Jennings 你開頭車
Jennings, you're driving lead.

775
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,100
Dunne和Falconio 你們在側翼
Dunne and Falconio, you're on the flank.

776
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,000
-Kinneman -在
- Kinneman. - Yeah.

777
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,670
眼睛盯緊叛軍活動
Keep your eyes peeled for insurgent activity.

778
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,870
Atwa之死的謠言毫無疑問
Rumors of Atwa's death are no doubt

779
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,020
正在全城流傳
circulating throughout the city,

780
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,110
所以肯定會有報複行為
so retribution is expected.

781
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,940
這你倒是說對了
You're right about that.

782
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,680
我很抱歉 探員們 但是這是一次安全簡報
I'm sorry, Agents, but this is a secure briefing.

783
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,220
太晚了 將軍
It's too late for that, General.

784
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,830
你的巡邏路線已經被破壞了
Your patrol route's already been compromised,

785
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,290
而且不是我們破壞的
and not by us.

786
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,360
你在說什麼
What are you talking about?

787
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,820
繼續啊 告訴他們
Go ahead, tell 'em.

788
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:20,690
我不知道你們什麼意思
I don't know what you mean.

789
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,900
好吧 我給你個提示
All right, I'll give you a hint.

790
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,240
一個詞 第一個字是 叛
One word, begins with the letter "T."

791
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,360
第二個字是 國
Rhymes with "reason."

792
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,570
最好有人馬上解釋一下這一切
Well, someone better start making sense real soon.

793
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,330
這位Kinneman把你們的運輸路線
Kinneman here was leaking your transport routes

794
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,770
泄露給了Aazar Atwa
to Aazar Atwa.

795
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,240
他們在撒謊
That's a lie.

796
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,740
真的嗎 好吧
Really? All right.

797
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,540
這人看起來眼熟嗎
Does this guy look familiar?

798
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,680
你的前同事和共犯
Your former coworker and accomplice,

799
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,250
Xavier Blackburn
Xavier Blackburn?

800
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,520
他正被NCIS拘留
He's in NCIS custody.

801
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,820
以破紀錄的時間就把你供出來了
Gave you up in record time.

802
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,390
別...別聽他們的
Do... do not listen to them.

803
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,520
這是個圈套
This is a setup.

804
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,090
Kinneman是個軍事承包商
Kinneman's a military contractor.

805
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,360
他為什麼要幫塔利班呢
Why would he be helping the Taliban?

806
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,430
簡單的經濟學
Simple economics.

807
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,100
美軍從喀布爾撤軍
U.S. forces pull out of Kabul,

808
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,830
他得以從中謀利的國防合同也就消失了
的his lucrative defense contracts disappear.

809
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,870
如果這個區域的敵軍襲擊增加
If enemy attacks increase in the area,

810
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,700
美軍就會加強部署
U.S. military strengthens their presence,

811
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,070
你的資金也就得到了保障
securing your funding.

812
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,370
所以你開始給Atwa傳遞
So you started passing Intel to Atwa

813
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,440
可以用來襲擊那幾個車隊的情報
on certain convoys to attack.

814
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,220
但是Voit上尉開始打探信息
But Captain Voit started digging around,

815
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,580
而你必須終結這件事
and you had to put an end to it.

816
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,580
所以你讓Atwa襲擊Voit的車隊
Then you had Atwa strike Voit's convoy.

817
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,980
然後你在Atwa供出你之前射殺了他
Then you shot Atwa before he could give you up.

818
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,250
對於一個受過高等狙擊訓練的人
Easy target for someone

819
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,850
比如你而言 這個目標太簡單了
with advanced sniper training, such as yourself.

820
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,390
得了 Kinneman
Come on, Kinneman,

821
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,020
這些人理應知道的
