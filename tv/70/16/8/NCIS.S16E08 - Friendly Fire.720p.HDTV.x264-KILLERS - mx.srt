1
00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:05,765
I'm not sure
what smells worse,

2
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:07,720
the water or the trash.

3
00:00:07,805 --> 00:00:10,191
At this point,
I'd say it's us.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,363
How did I let you
talk me into this?

5
00:00:13,607 --> 00:00:14,803
Blame Yale.

6
00:00:14,888 --> 00:00:16,635
They're the ones
who find applicants

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,791
with community service hours
to be highly desirable.

8
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:23,889
Unbelievable. I'm all-state
in water polo and lacrosse,

9
00:00:23,974 --> 00:00:26,021
and my ancestors came over
on the Mayflower.

10
00:00:26,117 --> 00:00:28,300
It doesn't get more
well-rounded than that.

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,737
What is that?

12
00:00:32,984 --> 00:00:35,779
A boot? How does somebody lose a boot?

13
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:42,605
That's gonna stain.

14
00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:55,699
Oh, screw this.

15
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,941
Yale can wait-list me.

20
00:01:28,742 --> 00:01:30,588
That's so cool. Thank you.

21
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,157
Ah, look
who finally made it.

22
00:01:33,242 --> 00:01:34,741
Where have the two of you been?

23
00:01:34,826 --> 00:01:37,229
Oh, another sunrise
sketching session.

24
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:40,035
Have you guys ever taken in dawn
at the, uh, Navy Yard?

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,595
It is quite peaceful.

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,252
- That's the fifth time this week.
- Yeah, that street art case

27
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:45,819
really inspired us
to get back into drawing.

28
00:01:45,904 --> 00:01:48,124
So while the two of you
have been playing Picasso,

29
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:51,292
McGee and I have been
working our asses off.

30
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:52,867
Oh, really?

31
00:01:53,158 --> 00:01:56,065
Ha! Diligent research,
I'm sure. Hmm.

32
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,955
All right, well,
let's see what you two drew.

33
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,479
We were rushed.

34
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:01,578
It's-it's not
the best, but...

35
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:02,885
Oh, wow.

36
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,350
What, are you kidding?
These are amazing.

37
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:06,954
Jimmy, I had no idea
you could draw like this, man.

38
00:02:07,032 --> 00:02:08,898
- What?
- Want to see talent?

39
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:10,836
Check this out.

40
00:02:13,336 --> 00:02:14,463
Is that
your painting

41
00:02:14,548 --> 00:02:16,163
- from our guys' night out?
- That's right.

42
00:02:16,248 --> 00:02:17,272
It's amazing, isn't it?

43
00:02:17,357 --> 00:02:19,768
The, uh, police evidence bag
really adds

44
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:21,330
a level of realism to it.

45
00:02:21,415 --> 00:02:23,421
- Texture.
- Nothing more real than a dead sailor.

46
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:24,914
Grab your gear.

47
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:27,509
See you.

48
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,186
Hey, let me see.

49
00:02:29,271 --> 00:02:30,295
Oh.

50
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,355
Twins paint
that, McGee?

51
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:34,941
Not exactly, boss.

52
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:36,418
Gibbs cut me.

53
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:38,105
He cut me deep.

54
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:40,723
Everyone's a critic.
Come on.

55
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:46,233
Waterway Volunteers
is a nonprofit

56
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:48,472
that clears trash
from rivers and oceans.

57
00:02:48,557 --> 00:02:50,269
Saving sea turtles
and dolphins

58
00:02:50,354 --> 00:02:53,530
from, you know,
plastic straws and all that.

59
00:02:53,615 --> 00:02:54,639
Straws are bad?

60
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:56,715
Plastic straws are poison
to sea life.

61
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:59,402
- Here, check out this video.
- No, not the video.

62
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:01,324
- I can't watch that thing again.
- You're not the one

63
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:03,404
with a synthetic rod
constricting your airway.

64
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:04,757
All right, Veronica,

65
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:06,474
Archie, let's stay on track.

66
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:08,022
What time
did you guys

67
00:03:08,107 --> 00:03:09,167
arrive on the scene?

68
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:10,296
6:00 a.m.

69
00:03:10,381 --> 00:03:12,323
Did you guys see anything
out of the ordinary?

70
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:14,262
You mean other
than the dead body?

71
00:03:15,585 --> 00:03:16,941
Actually, hold up.

72
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,324
Did you want us
to see something?

73
00:03:21,153 --> 00:03:22,436
What?

74
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,715
Maybe if we tell you
what you want to hear,

75
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:29,585
NCIS could write a couple
of letters of commendation

76
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,637
to the Yale Admissions Board
on our behalf?

77
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:34,965
Ah! Okay.
Yale?

78
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,910
- Yeah.
- Keep dreaming, buddy.

79
00:03:37,654 --> 00:03:38,925
What do you got, Palmer?

80
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,014
Well, other than
the broken neck,

81
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,101
there's no outward
signs of

82
00:03:42,186 --> 00:03:43,492
- trauma. - Agent Torres.
- You have time of death?

83
00:03:43,577 --> 00:03:44,988
Condition of the body
points to him

84
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:46,655
being in the water
for some time.

85
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,863
I'd say close to a week.

86
00:03:47,948 --> 00:03:50,699
I wasn't able to confirm his
identity using fingerprints.

87
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:52,868
Yeah, the guppies
got to him first.

88
00:03:52,953 --> 00:03:56,301
That is the circle of life,
gentlemen.

89
00:03:57,811 --> 00:03:59,309
I mean that
in the most respectful

90
00:03:59,394 --> 00:04:00,468
way possible,
by the way.

91
00:04:00,553 --> 00:04:02,191
We found his military
I.D. in his pocket,

92
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:04,402
and according to the
name tag on his uniform,

93
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:07,298
our... victim is Senior
Chief Richard Granger,

94
00:04:07,383 --> 00:04:09,346
assigned to the
Defense Logistics Agency.

95
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:12,823
Ah, Jethro,
I gave the body a quick examination.

96
00:04:12,908 --> 00:04:16,230
While there was no
outward appearance of trauma...

97
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:17,413
Neck is broken.

98
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:19,098
Already got that, Duck.

99
00:04:19,654 --> 00:04:20,842
Oh!

100
00:04:21,576 --> 00:04:22,640
Hey, Gibbs.

101
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:24,090
We have a big problem.

102
00:04:24,184 --> 00:04:26,808
I just got off the phone with
the Defense Logistics Agency,

103
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:29,304
where Senior Chief
Granger worked.

104
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:31,308
Any reason they didn't
report him UA?

105
00:04:31,393 --> 00:04:32,424
That's the thing.

106
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:37,027
Uh, the person I spoke to
was Senior Chief Granger.

107
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:38,370
He's alive.

108
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:40,332
Then who is this?

109
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:53,392
Do you recognize him?

110
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:54,778
My God.

111
00:04:54,863 --> 00:04:57,427
No. Who is he? That's what we
want to know.

112
00:04:57,512 --> 00:04:59,775
How'd he get your military I.D.
and your uniform?

113
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:01,732
My apartment was
broken into last week,

114
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:03,116
and some of my
gear was stolen.

115
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:05,087
I filed a police report,
but nothing came of it.

116
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,923
Any idea why
someone would want

117
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:09,056
to impersonate you,
Chief Granger?

118
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:10,708
Not a clue.

119
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:13,095
I'm a personnel clerk
in a logistics depot.

120
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,684
Not exactly a sexy job,

121
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:17,275
unless you're into color-coded
organizational charts.

122
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,808
Hold on.

123
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,463
Do I need protection
or something?

124
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:25,580
A guy pretending
to be me was killed.

125
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:27,267
Does that mean
I'm being targeted?

126
00:05:27,352 --> 00:05:28,783
Who said he was killed?

127
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:31,385
Not many people end up in the
Potomac from natural causes.

128
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:32,644
Mm.

129
00:05:42,832 --> 00:05:43,895
Oh!

130
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,050
I am so sorry,
Doctor. I...

131
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:48,004
I meant to clear
all my stuff out of here

132
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:49,970
now that you're back here
at NCIS full-time.

133
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:51,556
- Dr. Palmer.
- I know, I know.

134
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:55,692
An organized workspace
is an efficient workspace.

135
00:05:55,777 --> 00:05:59,259
Yes, it is, but I was about to
commend you on this drawing.

136
00:05:59,344 --> 00:06:02,614
- Oh, really?
- Yes, amazing detail.

137
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,931
I particularly like
the way you've drawn

138
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:07,799
the superior and inferior
vena cava.

139
00:06:08,393 --> 00:06:10,876
It seems you are as skillful
with a pencil

140
00:06:10,961 --> 00:06:12,861
as you are with a scalpel.

141
00:06:13,151 --> 00:06:15,980
Hopefully, I don't get the two
confused. That could get messy.

142
00:06:16,057 --> 00:06:18,925
____

143
00:06:19,465 --> 00:06:20,689
Right.

144
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:22,553
It's good to have you
back here, Doctor.

145
00:06:22,638 --> 00:06:24,204
Things weren't the same
around here without you.

146
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:27,205
Yeah, it's a welcome change
from my book tour.

147
00:06:27,504 --> 00:06:30,489
- Hey, Ducky. You rang?
- Yeah, our examination

148
00:06:30,574 --> 00:06:32,251
was correct...
The cause of death

149
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:34,770
was a fracture
to the C3 vertebra.

150
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:36,642
But it wasn't from
the fall into the water.

151
00:06:36,727 --> 00:06:38,158
The victim was dead
beforehand.

152
00:06:38,243 --> 00:06:39,239
So not a suicide?

153
00:06:39,324 --> 00:06:41,309
Not unless,
he broke his own neck

154
00:06:41,394 --> 00:06:44,049
and then somehow managed
to roll himself into the water.

155
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:47,540
Broke his own neck and rolled
himself into the water?

156
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,650
You know,
I don't have a story for that one.

157
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,885
Oh, that's never
happened before.

158
00:06:55,803 --> 00:06:57,759
I'm very uncomfortable
right now.

159
00:06:57,844 --> 00:06:59,692
Oh, so am I.

160
00:06:59,777 --> 00:07:01,103
Permission to proceed?

161
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:02,551
Granted.

162
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,626
All right, during
our examination,

163
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:06,454
we found a metal rod
in the victim's leg

164
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:07,791
from a previous
surgery.

165
00:07:07,898 --> 00:07:09,434
I ran the serial number
in the system,

166
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,630
came up with a hit.

167
00:07:10,715 --> 00:07:13,047
- So who's our victim?
- Meet our victim

168
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,005
and Navy impersonator,
Wesley Moore. He's 31.

169
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,431
He's a freelance
cyber systems engineer.

170
00:07:18,516 --> 00:07:20,794
Unmarried, no kids,
no next of kin,

171
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,716
which explains why
he was missing for a week

172
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:24,657
- and no one reported it.
- Criminal record?

173
00:07:24,742 --> 00:07:27,778
Other than a few late student
loan payments, this guy's clean.

174
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:29,673
Yeah, Moore had a brief stint
in the military

175
00:07:29,758 --> 00:07:31,590
eight years ago
before washing out

176
00:07:31,675 --> 00:07:33,903
of Marine Officer Candidate
School after a leg injury.

177
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:35,110
What about his movements
the night he was killed?

178
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:37,298
We tracked Moore's steps
with the I.D. he stole

179
00:07:37,383 --> 00:07:38,770
from Senior Chief
Granger.

180
00:07:38,855 --> 00:07:39,946
He used it
to gain access

181
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,887
to the Defense
Logistics Agency.

182
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:43,714
And security cameras
at the gate

183
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:45,414
captured his vehicle
entering the premises

184
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,371
at 2100 hours
last Wednesday.

185
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:48,980
Yeah, he exited
two hours later.

186
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:50,500
After that,
Moore fell off the grid.

187
00:07:50,585 --> 00:07:52,204
BOLO's already out on the car.

188
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:54,261
Why'd he sneak into
the DLA?

189
00:07:54,346 --> 00:07:57,140
To hack into the DoD's
classified message traffic.

190
00:07:57,225 --> 00:07:58,797
I'm working on
what he accessed,

191
00:07:58,882 --> 00:08:01,293
but sensitive data on
troops' movements overseas

192
00:08:01,378 --> 00:08:02,516
might have been compromised.

193
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:05,298
And we got a serious
security breach on our hands.

194
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:06,754
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

195
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,758
<i>Hi, Gibbs.
Do you have a minute?</i>

196
00:08:07,843 --> 00:08:09,493
Yeah, be right down.

197
00:08:09,752 --> 00:08:11,665
Find out
what Moore was after.

198
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:20,157
Water currents?

199
00:08:20,242 --> 00:08:22,411
Yeah, you'd think a person
who builds boats

200
00:08:22,496 --> 00:08:24,852
would find tide shifts
more fascinating.

201
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,529
A lead would be
fascinating.

202
00:08:26,614 --> 00:08:27,969
This is the lead.

203
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:29,825
What, did you think
I invited you down here

204
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,693
for some riveting nonverbal
conversation?

205
00:08:34,508 --> 00:08:36,280
Okay, uh, moving on.

206
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:39,766
So, I have been analyzing
the coastal tide patterns

207
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:41,055
for the past six days,

208
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,263
working backwards from where
Wesley Moore's body washed up

209
00:08:44,348 --> 00:08:47,298
to determine where his body
first entered the water.

210
00:08:47,383 --> 00:08:49,299
- Narrowed down the search grid.
- Hey!

211
00:08:49,384 --> 00:08:51,804
Now we're on
the same wavelength.

212
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:54,102
Okay.

213
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:58,291
And not a fan of puns.
Okay, um, good to know.

214
00:08:58,376 --> 00:09:00,719
Okay, if my calculations
are correct,

215
00:09:00,804 --> 00:09:02,197
Moore's body was dumped

216
00:09:02,282 --> 00:09:06,153
somewhere within a two-mile
stretch of shoreline near...

217
00:09:06,238 --> 00:09:07,658
North Old Town.

218
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:11,594
Uh, Gibbs,
I've got something.

219
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:15,289
Wesley Moore's e-mail
and phone records indicate

220
00:09:15,374 --> 00:09:19,378
he received several messages
from Captain Alicia Voit,

221
00:09:19,463 --> 00:09:21,979
a Marine stationed
in Kabul, Afghanistan.

222
00:09:22,064 --> 00:09:23,648
And in their last
correspondence,

223
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:26,218
two weeks ago,
Voit e-mailed Moore

224
00:09:26,303 --> 00:09:28,456
the names of
12 dead Marines.

225
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,586
Please tell me this is not
another hit list.

226
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:33,039
No. Not so much.
All of those Marines died

227
00:09:33,124 --> 00:09:35,370
prior to Voit's message
being sent.

228
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:36,948
Why would she
message a list

229
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:38,944
of deceased Marines'
names to Moore?

230
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:40,383
Contact the base
in Kabul.

231
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,816
- Get Voit on MTAC.
- Uh, Gibbs,

232
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:45,289
that's impossible.

233
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:48,575
Captain Alicia Voit was killed
in action six days ago,

234
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:51,234
same day as
our victim,

235
00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:52,844
Wesley Moore.

236
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:56,909
Captain Alicia Voit, 30,

237
00:09:56,994 --> 00:09:58,964
a highly decorated
Marine

238
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:01,711
who was serving her third tour
in Afghanistan.

239
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:03,316
She was killed
six days ago

240
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:05,988
after her convoy was ambushed
by Taliban insurgents

241
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,781
- just outside of Kabul.
- The attack was led

242
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:09,292
by Aazar Atwa,

243
00:10:09,377 --> 00:10:11,505
an extremist responsible
for multiple

244
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,281
U.S. casualties
over the past year.

245
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:15,995
Captain Voit's body was sent
to Dover Air Force Base.

246
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,220
Her remains are set
to be released tomorrow.

247
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:19,898
What's her connection
to Wesley Moore?

248
00:10:19,983 --> 00:10:22,097
They met at Marine Officer
Candidate School

249
00:10:22,182 --> 00:10:24,324
- eight years ago.
- Moore washed out of the program,

250
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:25,475
but the two remained close.

251
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,180
They were definitely
more than that.

252
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,027
I mean, by their e-mails
and social media posts,

253
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:31,562
yeah, they were
definitely involved.

254
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:33,519
Um, I read those letters.

255
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:35,297
There was nothing
romantic in them.

256
00:10:35,382 --> 00:10:38,227
Bishop. Single guy, single girl.
Do the math.

257
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:40,003
News flash, Torres.

258
00:10:40,088 --> 00:10:42,836
Uh, men and women can have
platonic relationships.

259
00:10:43,181 --> 00:10:44,326
Why?

260
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:47,219
McGee, what about the intel
Moore hacked from the DLA?

261
00:10:47,304 --> 00:10:50,198
He accessed the non-redacted
after-action reports

262
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,628
on the 12 K.I.A. Marines

263
00:10:51,713 --> 00:10:54,172
Captain Voit listed
in her last e-mail to him.

264
00:10:54,257 --> 00:10:57,777
All were victims of Aazar Atwa's
previous attacks.

265
00:10:57,862 --> 00:10:59,977
Torres, focus
on Kasie's search grid.

266
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:01,812
Find out where Moore's body
was dumped.

267
00:11:01,897 --> 00:11:03,743
McGee, Bishop,
get your go-bags.

268
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:06,579
- Go-bags?
- Oh, where are we going?

269
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:08,125
Afghanistan.

270
00:11:17,998 --> 00:11:20,541
Present arms!

271
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,903
Order arms!

272
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:42,448
Right or left, face!

273
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,958
Forward march!

274
00:11:53,731 --> 00:11:55,534
You must be Agent Gibbs.

275
00:11:55,755 --> 00:11:58,320
HQ said to expect you.
Colonel Park.

276
00:11:58,598 --> 00:12:00,842
You're the Marine escort
assigned to Captain Voit?

277
00:12:01,122 --> 00:12:04,511
Affirmative. I am tasked
with her final transit home.

278
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,362
The captain's remains should be
released within the hour.

279
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:11,233
Something wrong?

280
00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:13,364
Colonels aren't usually
assigned these details.

281
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:15,784
A Marine goes where
he's needed, Agent Gibbs.

282
00:12:16,308 --> 00:12:17,643
What's your destination?

283
00:12:17,728 --> 00:12:20,538
Strathmere, New Jersey.
Captain Voit's hometown.

284
00:12:21,122 --> 00:12:23,886
Our transport will be departing
at 1000 hours.

285
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,642
Colonel, I'm afraid
there's going to be a delay.

286
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,955
- Excuse me?
- Captain Voit

287
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,854
is now part of an active
murder investigation.

288
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,800
Murder investigation?

289
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:38,412
I wasn't informed of that.

290
00:12:38,497 --> 00:12:39,571
Her remains are
to be brought

291
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:41,995
to NCIS until we have
more answers.

292
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:45,596
I understand your...

293
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:48,526
your situation,
Agent Gibbs,

294
00:12:49,022 --> 00:12:50,808
but I cannot allow that.

295
00:12:51,978 --> 00:12:53,995
It's not a request, Colonel.

296
00:12:54,645 --> 00:12:57,279
It's my duty
to get the captain home

297
00:12:57,364 --> 00:12:59,013
to be laid to rest
in two days.

298
00:12:59,098 --> 00:13:01,096
And I'll do everything I can
to ensure that happens.

299
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:03,531
With all due respect,
that's not good enough for me.

300
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,409
Colonel, there's a possibility
that Captain Voit's death

301
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,792
is connected
to another murder case.

302
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:10,596
We owe it to
both victims

303
00:13:10,681 --> 00:13:12,229
to find out the truth.

304
00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:18,695
That is something
we do agree on.

305
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,948
All right.

306
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,532
But I'm going with you.

307
00:13:25,864 --> 00:13:28,024
Don't expect me
to leave the captain's side.

308
00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:29,415
Understood.

309
00:13:35,217 --> 00:13:37,371
What kind of mud is this?

310
00:13:37,456 --> 00:13:39,394
It feels like quicksand.

311
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:41,715
Are you sure this is
the right search grid?

312
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,259
Oh, yeah, positive.
Moore's body

313
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:44,609
had to have entered
the water,

314
00:13:44,694 --> 00:13:46,808
like, around here.

315
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:49,949
Oh, my... oh, my...
oh, my God! Oh, my God!

316
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:51,961
Oh, my God, did you see
the size of that fly?

317
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:54,525
It was, like, prehistoric.
Oooh! Ohh!

318
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,681
Uh, consider this your crash
course on field agent work.

319
00:13:57,766 --> 00:13:59,813
Yeah, okay, well, getting
covered in grime and, like,

320
00:13:59,898 --> 00:14:03,900
eaten by flies isn't exactly
the high-octane experience

321
00:14:03,985 --> 00:14:05,779
- you promised.
- The day's young, sister.

322
00:14:05,864 --> 00:14:08,383
Fine, but if I see
one snake, I am...

323
00:14:08,468 --> 00:14:09,978
- I'm out of here.
- Wait, snake?

324
00:14:10,063 --> 00:14:11,814
What are you...
Wait, what do you mean, snake?

325
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:13,084
What are you talking about, snakes?
Oh, yeah. They thrive

326
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:14,933
in swampy ecosystems.

327
00:14:17,327 --> 00:14:18,428
All right, okay.

328
00:14:18,513 --> 00:14:20,404
Well, uh... stay on it.

329
00:14:20,489 --> 00:14:24,463
Get 'er done.
I'm gonna... I'll be right back.

330
00:14:24,548 --> 00:14:26,192
Yeah, that's usually
what someone says

331
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:28,012
right before they're killed
in a horror movie,

332
00:14:28,097 --> 00:14:30,801
but yeah,
I'm sure this is totally different.

333
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:33,795
I love my job,
I love my job, I love my job,

334
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,987
I love my job. Oof!

335
00:14:35,072 --> 00:14:36,576
Hey, man.

336
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:38,912
Can I have a word?

337
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:42,004
Hey, it's about time.

338
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:44,645
Been out here on
my own all morning.

339
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:50,706
What, are you waiting for an invitation?
Start pulling your weight.

340
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,878
Okay, take it down
a notch, buddy. NCIS.

341
00:14:56,277 --> 00:14:58,002
Sorry about that.
I, uh...

342
00:14:58,087 --> 00:15:00,199
I thought you were
one of our volunteers.

343
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,316
He's over an hour
and a half late.

344
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,481
Are you with, uh,
Waterway Volunteers?

345
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:06,356
Uh, yeah. That's right.

346
00:15:06,456 --> 00:15:07,769
I spent my
morning covering

347
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:09,755
a half-mile stretch that way.

348
00:15:10,097 --> 00:15:12,231
Why? What's NCIS
doing out here?

349
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,371
Nick! Got something!

350
00:15:21,696 --> 00:15:24,050
What kind of car did you say
Wesley Moore had?

351
00:15:24,135 --> 00:15:25,973
It's a silver Ford Focus.

352
00:15:34,822 --> 00:15:36,254
Not bad, Kasie.

353
00:15:36,341 --> 00:15:37,670
Thanks.

354
00:15:46,023 --> 00:15:49,031
Why would a decorated Marine
like Captain Voit get mixed up

355
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,520
with somebody like
Wesley Moore?

356
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:52,443
Well, they're not
that different, Leon.

357
00:15:52,606 --> 00:15:56,147
Both were orphaned as teenagers,
were children of public servants

358
00:15:56,232 --> 00:15:59,419
and shared this pure desire
to serve their country.

359
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:01,098
Are we talking
about the same Moore?

360
00:16:01,183 --> 00:16:03,209
The one who impersonated
a Navy sailor,

361
00:16:03,294 --> 00:16:05,440
who broke onto a secure
military facility

362
00:16:05,525 --> 00:16:08,249
and hacked into
a confidential DoD server,

363
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,709
putting thousands
of U.S. troops at risk?

364
00:16:10,794 --> 00:16:12,014
Hey, I didn't say
he was perfect.

365
00:16:12,099 --> 00:16:13,287
Well, there's an understatement.

366
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,190
But I don't believe
that Moore

367
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:18,120
accessed those files
for nefarious reasons.

368
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:20,654
- He-he did it to help Voit.
- Help how?

369
00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:23,823
- Voit was looking for answers.
- Right. On the 12 dead Marines.

370
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:25,122
She knew that Moore

371
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:27,287
could hack into DoD's system

372
00:16:27,372 --> 00:16:29,127
and cut through
the governmental red tape.

373
00:16:29,212 --> 00:16:30,959
Yeah, in a highly illegal way.

374
00:16:31,044 --> 00:16:32,800
Which suggests a
sense of urgency.

375
00:16:32,885 --> 00:16:36,612
Now, Captain Voit
reached out to Moore

376
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:38,652
instead of going through
her chain of command.

377
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,737
- Why?
- 'Cause Voit didn't know who to trust.

378
00:16:40,822 --> 00:16:43,015
Exactly.
You think their deaths are connected?

379
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,209
100%.

380
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,019
They both died
the same day...

381
00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:47,888
One in D.C.,
one in Afghanistan.

382
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,213
Coordinated attacks, yeah?

383
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:53,003
And the key to why has to do
with Afghanistan.

384
00:16:53,302 --> 00:16:55,303
And this is usually
the time you tell me

385
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:57,501
that you've already sent
a team en route.

386
00:16:57,586 --> 00:16:59,393
Sent McGee and Bishop
this morning.

387
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:01,698
They should be
at Camp Russell any minute.

388
00:17:02,484 --> 00:17:05,547
Don't ask me. I-I don't know
how he does it, either.

389
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,152
The CG's been briefed
on the situation.

390
00:17:23,237 --> 00:17:24,878
He said to assist
in any way possible.

391
00:17:24,963 --> 00:17:26,476
- When can we speak with him?
- Well, he's finishing up

392
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:28,343
with a new Marine detachment
that arrived today.

393
00:17:28,428 --> 00:17:30,378
Thought, uh, U.S. forces
were supposed to be

394
00:17:30,463 --> 00:17:32,323
withdrawing from Afghanistan.
That was the plan.

395
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:33,806
But with the Taliban's
attacks increasing

396
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:35,745
and their grip on
Kabul strengthening,

397
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,023
the withdrawal's
been put on hold.

398
00:17:37,108 --> 00:17:38,870
So you're familiar
with Aazar Atwa?

399
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:40,607
Yes, ma'am. You'd be
hard-pressed to find

400
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,025
a Marine here
who isn't.

401
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,983
We've lost a lot of good people
because of him.

402
00:17:44,068 --> 00:17:46,619
Captain Voit was just
the most recent casualty.

403
00:17:47,054 --> 00:17:49,964
You could say Atwa is public
enemy number one around here.

404
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:51,681
Agents Bishop
and McGee.

405
00:17:52,126 --> 00:17:54,777
I'm General Braxton,
CG of Camp Russell.

406
00:17:54,862 --> 00:17:56,529
Appreciate
the assistance, General. Of course.

407
00:17:56,614 --> 00:17:58,233
Captain Voit was one of our own.

408
00:17:58,318 --> 00:17:59,757
We want her to have justice.

409
00:17:59,992 --> 00:18:02,803
And it looks like you both have
arrived just in time to see it.

410
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:03,941
How's that?

411
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:05,577
I received word
from our patrol

412
00:18:05,662 --> 00:18:07,460
in the northeast sector
who were conducting a raid

413
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,507
of a suspected Taliban
safe house.

414
00:18:09,592 --> 00:18:12,179
- Did they find the weapons cache?
- Better.

415
00:18:12,485 --> 00:18:14,231
They found Aazar Atwa.

416
00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:15,486
Wh-Where's Atwa now?

417
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:17,966
En route back to our base,
under heavy guard.

418
00:18:18,051 --> 00:18:21,179
You have questions
about Captain Voit's death?

419
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:23,954
You'll soon get the chance
to question her killer

420
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,350
face-to-face.

421
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,796
Are you sure there's nothing
I can get for you, Colonel?

422
00:18:43,262 --> 00:18:45,421
No. Thank you.
I'm fine.

423
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:49,530
Do you mind me asking what's,
uh... what's in the bag?

424
00:18:50,317 --> 00:18:52,991
Contains Captain Voit's
personal effects.

425
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:55,713
Ah. Yeah, I couldn't
help but notice that...

426
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:58,577
you won't let it out of
your sight, even for a second.

427
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,267
Per DoD regulations,

428
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:02,595
a fallen service member's
personal effects

429
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,224
shall remain in the escort's
possession at all times

430
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:08,099
until directly delivered
to the next of kin.

431
00:19:08,187 --> 00:19:09,765
Mm-hmm.

432
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:13,622
You know, I can't imagine a more
difficult detail for a Marine

433
00:19:13,707 --> 00:19:17,877
to be assigned than escorting
a fallen brother or sister home.

434
00:19:20,804 --> 00:19:23,138
I suspect your job
is not much different, Doctor.

435
00:19:23,223 --> 00:19:27,802
Yeah. It's a, uh...
it's a struggle at times.

436
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:29,821
But I take comfort
in knowing that we're helping

437
00:19:29,906 --> 00:19:31,896
to provide with some closure.

438
00:19:32,722 --> 00:19:34,756
My comfort is inconsequential.

439
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:37,724
Those that make
the ultimate sacrifice

440
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:38,801
for this country

441
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,849
deserve to be brought home
with honor.

442
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:44,423
Duck, what do we know?

443
00:19:44,508 --> 00:19:46,552
An examination
of Captain Voit

444
00:19:46,637 --> 00:19:48,764
could not be performed since

445
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,622
she has already been
processed for burial.

446
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:54,571
But the records from
Kabul and Dover

447
00:19:54,656 --> 00:19:55,805
are very thorough.

448
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,295
The captain was first struck
with two bullets to the chest.

449
00:19:59,427 --> 00:20:01,688
Uh, despite
her grave condition,

450
00:20:01,773 --> 00:20:03,950
she managed to take
out four insurgents

451
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:06,662
before the third and
fatal blow to the head.

452
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:08,482
She never gave up.

453
00:20:09,218 --> 00:20:10,599
That's a Marine.

454
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,430
Okay.
We are done here.

455
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:17,048
Colonel? I complied with
your request,

456
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,771
Agent Gibbs. I allowed you
to bring Captain Voit here,

457
00:20:19,856 --> 00:20:21,325
against my better judgment.

458
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,552
As your doctors
have just pointed out,

459
00:20:23,637 --> 00:20:25,849
she is of no further use to you.

460
00:20:26,023 --> 00:20:28,179
Release her remains,
and allow me

461
00:20:28,264 --> 00:20:29,333
to finish my mission.

462
00:20:29,418 --> 00:20:31,334
Evidence is still
being processed.

463
00:20:31,515 --> 00:20:33,075
Our investigation isn't over.

464
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,778
But my cooperation is.

465
00:20:34,863 --> 00:20:37,499
W-We'll give you
two a moment.

466
00:20:43,273 --> 00:20:45,010
What's this? A memo,

467
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:46,680
from the Secretary of Defense,

468
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:48,492
ensuring your
full cooperation.

469
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:50,962
Explain to me how the captain
can be involved

470
00:20:51,047 --> 00:20:53,583
in a murder in the States
when she was in Afghanistan.

471
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:54,974
This makes no sense.

472
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:56,904
I'm doing my job!

473
00:20:58,578 --> 00:21:01,099
I thought you were
a Marine, Gibbs.

474
00:21:01,648 --> 00:21:04,209
If you were,
you'd have her back.

475
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:07,982
Her burial is in 36 hours.

476
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,748
I will get her there.

477
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:30,403
Hey, Kasie.

478
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:31,984
How you doing?

479
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:34,012
On a scale of one to ten?

480
00:21:34,217 --> 00:21:35,566
We're in the negatives.

481
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:37,512
Whoa. Yeah, tell me about it.

482
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:40,321
I tried being a field agent,
and it bit me.

483
00:21:40,756 --> 00:21:41,960
Look at me.

484
00:21:42,045 --> 00:21:44,145
It's like a
connect-the-dots sheet.

485
00:21:46,381 --> 00:21:47,680
I'm not really laughing.

486
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,762
Okay, well, since work is
one of the only things

487
00:21:49,847 --> 00:21:52,066
distracting me from
the urge to itch,

488
00:21:52,151 --> 00:21:53,890
I'm just gonna
jump right in.

489
00:21:53,975 --> 00:21:57,066
I didn't find any usable
prints in Wesley Moore's car,

490
00:21:57,151 --> 00:22:00,051
but I hit the jackpot
with the rear body damage.

491
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:01,520
Check this out.

492
00:22:01,772 --> 00:22:03,670
This is a surveillance image

493
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:05,406
of Moore leaving the DLA

494
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,059
- on the night that he was killed.
- You notice anything?

495
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:13,156
Taillight and fender are intact.

496
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:15,025
Yeah. Meaning this
vehicle was damaged

497
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,257
later that night,

498
00:22:16,342 --> 00:22:17,499
before he was killed.

499
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:19,777
So, if he was being tailed,
the killer must have, uh,

500
00:22:19,862 --> 00:22:22,770
caused a fender bender
to get Moore out of the car.

501
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,484
So I pulled a second
paint profile

502
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:27,320
of the killer's car
in question. Whoo!

503
00:22:27,405 --> 00:22:29,786
Try saying that
five times fast.

504
00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:33,465
And it is a lacquer-based red
with a metallic base coat.

505
00:22:33,593 --> 00:22:35,230
Okay, hundreds of cars
match that.

506
00:22:35,315 --> 00:22:37,777
Actually,
since it's one of the most used

507
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:39,665
paint types in production,

508
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,617
the number's more
in the thousands.

509
00:22:41,702 --> 00:22:43,480
How do you suggest
we narrow down our suspects?

510
00:22:43,565 --> 00:22:46,054
Well, with, uh,
persistence, diligence,

511
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:47,621
and our combined
computer skills.

512
00:22:47,706 --> 00:22:51,382
Combined?
What am I, Bishop or McGee?

513
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:52,515
No, I'm more of, like,

514
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,004
a physical specimen,
man, you know?

515
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:55,963
You know, punching,
intimidating,

516
00:22:56,048 --> 00:22:57,676
- that's more my thing.
- Mm, okay.

517
00:22:57,761 --> 00:23:00,669
I trekked through a swamp
for you, Nicholas.

518
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:03,894
So, if you bail on me now,
you're just gonna find

519
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:07,473
a slithering copperhead snake
in your desk drawer.

520
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,755
Ooh, or in your bed.

521
00:23:10,927 --> 00:23:13,059
Ah! Or worse.

522
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,882
Is it just me,

523
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:20,234
or does this feel... Too easy?

524
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:22,223
No, it's not just you.

525
00:23:29,412 --> 00:23:32,520
He looks pretty carefree
for a captured terrorist.

526
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:35,958
You gonna translate?

527
00:23:36,085 --> 00:23:38,715
No. I don't need to,

528
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,223
'cause he can understand us
just fine.

529
00:23:41,308 --> 00:23:43,043
Isn't that right?

530
00:23:43,128 --> 00:23:45,028
Yes, I can.

531
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,855
Sorry, does something amuse you?

532
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,114
This. All of it.

533
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:53,401
Well, let me show you
what I don't find funny.

534
00:23:53,584 --> 00:23:55,354
Alicia Voit,

535
00:23:55,785 --> 00:23:57,604
Max Wiezman,

536
00:23:57,766 --> 00:23:59,815
Anna Gutierrez,

537
00:23:59,915 --> 00:24:03,287
Tyson Eccles, Nolan Takahamo.

538
00:24:03,372 --> 00:24:04,388
Should I continue?

539
00:24:04,473 --> 00:24:06,228
- Those names mean nothing to me.
- Well, they should.

540
00:24:06,313 --> 00:24:08,713
They're the names of some
of the Marines you killed.

541
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,832
Again...

542
00:24:12,724 --> 00:24:14,549
they mean nothing to me.

543
00:24:14,926 --> 00:24:16,140
So you don't deny it?

544
00:24:16,225 --> 00:24:17,806
Why deny what I'm proud of?

545
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:21,881
Well, if you're so proud,
tell us about her.

546
00:24:22,015 --> 00:24:24,173
She was part of the convoy
you hit last week.

547
00:24:24,258 --> 00:24:25,517
I remember.

548
00:24:25,668 --> 00:24:27,823
The sky was so clear
that day.

549
00:24:27,928 --> 00:24:30,628
We could see their vehicle
from miles away,

550
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,683
unfortunately for her.

551
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:34,392
Wasn't that easy.

552
00:24:34,477 --> 00:24:36,376
Captain Voit killed
four of your men

553
00:24:36,461 --> 00:24:37,831
before you could finish her off.

554
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:39,597
Guess you underestimated her.

555
00:24:41,024 --> 00:24:43,402
Are we going to continue
this game,

556
00:24:43,724 --> 00:24:46,936
or do you want to know
the truth about my attacks?

557
00:24:47,664 --> 00:24:49,258
Tell us.

558
00:24:51,568 --> 00:24:54,202
Only if I get something
in return.

559
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:56,459
My freedom.

560
00:24:56,656 --> 00:24:57,828
How original.

561
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,256
You're a terrorist
who killed 13 U.S. Marines.

562
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,048
Hope you enjoy
those shackles,

563
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:04,381
'cause you're gonna
be living in a cell

564
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:07,162
for the rest of your life.
Let's go.

565
00:25:10,122 --> 00:25:11,912
I had help,

566
00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:14,279
from an American.

567
00:25:17,127 --> 00:25:19,271
Now do I have your attention?

568
00:25:26,804 --> 00:25:29,146
You were working
with an American?

569
00:25:30,617 --> 00:25:31,641
Prove it.

570
00:25:31,726 --> 00:25:34,298
My freedom
for a traitor

571
00:25:34,383 --> 00:25:36,772
who's been betraying
your country.

572
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:39,391
Fair trade,

573
00:25:39,828 --> 00:25:41,490
don't you think?

574
00:25:44,062 --> 00:25:46,149
Atwa's out of his damn mind.

575
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:48,669
The U.S. government will not do
a deal with a known terrorist.

576
00:25:48,754 --> 00:25:51,665
I understand, Director,
but Atwa claims

577
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,849
he's been working with
an American on the inside.

578
00:25:53,934 --> 00:25:54,962
Atwa's smart.

579
00:25:55,047 --> 00:25:56,485
He'll say whatever
we want to hear

580
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:57,981
if it means securing
his release.

581
00:25:58,066 --> 00:26:00,427
We have no guarantee
what he gives us is the truth.

582
00:26:00,512 --> 00:26:02,849
Yes, and normally, Sloane,
I would agree with you,

583
00:26:03,113 --> 00:26:06,157
but not this time. I-I really
don't think he's bluffing.

584
00:26:06,242 --> 00:26:07,568
Bishop, what do you know?

585
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:10,443
Look, I-I've dealt with
insurgents like Atwa before.

586
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:13,399
He-he's not agitated,
nervous or volatile.

587
00:26:13,484 --> 00:26:15,110
He is, in fact, assured,

588
00:26:15,195 --> 00:26:18,287
like someone who knows
that they have the advantage.

589
00:26:18,382 --> 00:26:19,626
12 dead Marines.

590
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:20,766
What about them?

591
00:26:20,851 --> 00:26:22,630
Transports were hit
by the Taliban.

592
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:25,555
Convoy routes are changed
at the last minute.

593
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,609
Yeah. Someone had to
be directly relaying

594
00:26:27,694 --> 00:26:28,802
their movements to Atwa.

595
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:31,293
Well, even if that's true,
it doesn't erase the fact

596
00:26:31,378 --> 00:26:33,974
that Atwa's caused
the deaths of multiple troops.

597
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,545
- He wants to talk,
- Leon.

598
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,317
Well, then get him to talk,
but he's not getting a deal.

599
00:26:38,636 --> 00:26:40,255
Is that clear?

600
00:26:40,695 --> 00:26:43,270
Uh, yes, yes, Director.

601
00:26:43,355 --> 00:26:44,866
Gibbs?

602
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,066
His friends don't need
to know that.

603
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:54,011
Colonel, it's late.

604
00:26:54,096 --> 00:26:56,731
Got a room waiting for you
at the BOQ.

605
00:26:57,059 --> 00:26:59,323
That won't be necessary.
I'm doing fine.

606
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:01,441
DoD escorts are
permitted

607
00:27:01,526 --> 00:27:04,575
to leave
service members' remains

608
00:27:05,054 --> 00:27:06,457
at a secure location.

609
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,880
I know
what the regulations say.

610
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:11,888
I just don't feel right
leaving the captain alone.

611
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:14,860
Yeah, figured you were
gonna say something like that.

612
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,052
What are you doing?

613
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:25,076
I'm getting you a cot.

614
00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:27,361
- I told you, I'm fine.
- Yeah, yeah, I know,

615
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:29,455
- you're fine.
- I got it, okay.

616
00:27:29,908 --> 00:27:31,563
Got to sleep somewhere.

617
00:27:32,052 --> 00:27:33,690
Hey, take it
or leave it.

618
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:35,661
Your call.

619
00:27:44,391 --> 00:27:46,182
I owe you an apology

620
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,378
for what I said earlier, Gibbs.

621
00:27:49,492 --> 00:27:52,065
It was wrong to question
your service.

622
00:27:54,154 --> 00:27:55,809
I've been there, Colonel.

623
00:27:57,278 --> 00:27:59,604
It is not easy

624
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:02,990
getting assigned
an escort detail.

625
00:28:04,426 --> 00:28:06,130
No.

626
00:28:07,106 --> 00:28:08,565
No, it's not.

627
00:28:10,812 --> 00:28:13,612
It's even harder
if you volunteered for it.

628
00:28:15,484 --> 00:28:17,488
Was it that obvious?

629
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,589
How'd you know Captain Voit?

630
00:28:24,325 --> 00:28:27,188
I was the one
who recruited her.

631
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,995
Met Voit ten years ago.

632
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:34,756
She had just lost both of
her parents the winter before.

633
00:28:34,841 --> 00:28:36,477
She was putting herself
through college.

634
00:28:36,562 --> 00:28:40,151
She was a real hard worker,
and good head on her shoulders.

635
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:42,423
Marine material.

636
00:28:42,528 --> 00:28:44,323
I can always tell within a...

637
00:28:44,769 --> 00:28:46,320
within a minute
of meeting somebody

638
00:28:46,405 --> 00:28:49,370
whether...
they have what it takes.

639
00:28:49,587 --> 00:28:50,973
Voit did.

640
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,682
I was the one

641
00:28:55,881 --> 00:28:58,112
who swore her in,

642
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:02,511
so I should be the one
to bring her home,

643
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:07,143
just like I
did for all the other

644
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:09,886
fallen Marines
that I've recruited.

645
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,958
How many?

646
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:16,370
One is too many.

647
00:29:17,575 --> 00:29:20,823
You're not responsible
for their deaths, Colonel.

648
00:29:22,246 --> 00:29:24,729
You've lost people, right?

649
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,847
As a Marine,

650
00:29:27,177 --> 00:29:28,917
as an agent?

651
00:29:31,118 --> 00:29:33,823
Did you
not feel responsible?

652
00:29:38,645 --> 00:29:42,245
They were just...
just kids who...

653
00:29:43,036 --> 00:29:45,932
joined the military
under my guidance.

654
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:50,315
I'll carry their deaths with me

655
00:29:51,051 --> 00:29:52,653
every day.

656
00:29:56,677 --> 00:29:58,617
I owe them that much.

657
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:05,508
- Where are we going?
- Transferring you.

658
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:07,351
To Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba.

659
00:30:07,492 --> 00:30:10,307
Hope you like humidity
and solitary.

660
00:30:10,466 --> 00:30:11,982
Is that supposed
to frighten me?

661
00:30:12,067 --> 00:30:14,226
No, but putting you in a cell
with Gibbs may.

662
00:30:14,311 --> 00:30:15,539
Last chance, Atwa.

663
00:30:15,624 --> 00:30:17,132
Tell us the American
you're working with.

664
00:30:17,217 --> 00:30:19,421
- Not until I'm released.
- May want to rethink that.

665
00:30:19,506 --> 00:30:22,038
I can't imagine your fellow
insurgents would look favorably

666
00:30:22,123 --> 00:30:23,851
on you working with us.

667
00:30:24,025 --> 00:30:26,875
The fate of an American
isn't their concern.

668
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,008
They know I would
never betray them.

669
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:31,089
Well, unless we spread word
around town

670
00:30:31,174 --> 00:30:32,671
that you gave them up
for your freedom.

671
00:30:32,756 --> 00:30:34,069
We can be very convincing.

672
00:30:34,154 --> 00:30:36,726
They'll see you as a traitor
and a liability.

673
00:30:36,994 --> 00:30:39,354
You won't last one minute
outside those gates,

674
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:40,609
not without our protection.

675
00:30:40,694 --> 00:30:43,301
So, if you enjoy breathing,
I suggest you start talking

676
00:30:43,386 --> 00:30:45,930
and tell us who
your American contact is.

677
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:48,142
Very well.

678
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,039
12 months ago, I began receiving
intelligence from a source.

679
00:31:08,256 --> 00:31:10,444
What the hell happened,
McGee?

680
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:12,223
Sniper fire
from the mountains.

681
00:31:12,467 --> 00:31:13,784
No one had eyes
on the shooter.

682
00:31:13,869 --> 00:31:15,218
Did Atwa give you
anything?

683
00:31:15,303 --> 00:31:17,098
He was about to
when the gunfire started.

684
00:31:17,183 --> 00:31:18,696
Well, someone wanted
to shut him up.

685
00:31:18,781 --> 00:31:20,395
Which means we got
a mole on our hands

686
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,297
with advanced sniper training.
That's perfect.

687
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:25,266
The details of Atwa's transfer
never left Camp Russell.

688
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:27,283
So it had to be
someone in-house.

689
00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:29,469
Bishop's going through
all the personnel files now.

690
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,603
Listen to me, McGee,
you find him!

691
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,204
I'm not sure I can stare
at this screen much longer.

692
00:31:47,292 --> 00:31:49,986
This glare is making me
squint,

693
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:52,665
and this face doesn't do
wrinkles.

694
00:31:52,753 --> 00:31:54,238
Come on, team.

695
00:31:54,323 --> 00:31:55,723
Sure, we pulled
an all-nighter

696
00:31:55,808 --> 00:31:57,594
combing traffic-cam footage,
and we're no closer

697
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,173
to finding our suspect, but
we're in this together, right?

698
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:03,783
- Friends helping friends.
- Jimmy,

699
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:05,016
stop talking.

700
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:07,423
Hey, Jimmy.

701
00:32:08,003 --> 00:32:09,618
When'd you get here?

702
00:32:09,703 --> 00:32:11,636
Oh, boy.

703
00:32:11,964 --> 00:32:14,118
The top o' the morning
to you.

704
00:32:14,203 --> 00:32:17,805
I bring much-needed
sustenance.

705
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:20,363
Two black coffees.

706
00:32:20,448 --> 00:32:22,695
There we are.
And, uh,

707
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,516
one large double mocha

708
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:28,000
frozen blend
with whipping cream

709
00:32:28,085 --> 00:32:32,122
and chocolate chips,
and a drizzle of caramel.

710
00:32:32,207 --> 00:32:35,362
Yes.
Mm.

711
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:37,683
Now, that hits the spot.

712
00:32:37,768 --> 00:32:40,813
You can eat that
and still look like that?

713
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,917
Man, life's not fair.

714
00:32:44,002 --> 00:32:45,922
Jimmy, uh, you disgust me.

715
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:48,933
Hey... got something.

716
00:32:49,018 --> 00:32:51,750
Red truck matching
our description.

717
00:32:51,862 --> 00:32:54,175
Ooh, complete with
front bumper damage.

718
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,390
- Where was this picture taken?
- Traffic cam,

719
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,656
ten miles from where

720
00:32:57,741 --> 00:32:59,105
Moore's car was found

721
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,722
on the night
he was killed.

722
00:33:00,807 --> 00:33:02,352
Who's the truck
registered to?

723
00:33:02,455 --> 00:33:04,527
Xavier Blackburn.

724
00:33:04,612 --> 00:33:06,133
Civilian from Falls Church.

725
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:08,336
Hey, I ran into this guy
at the marsh.

726
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:10,751
He said he was with
Waterway Volunteers.

727
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:13,642
Uh, there's no Xavier Blackburn
listed on their crew roster.

728
00:33:13,727 --> 00:33:15,570
Then what was he doing
at the marsh?

729
00:33:15,655 --> 00:33:18,133
Doing
what all guilty people do.

730
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,422
Covering his tracks.

731
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:26,340
So, let me see
if I got this right.

732
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:29,766
Volunteering my time
makes me a murder suspect?

733
00:33:30,744 --> 00:33:32,429
Talk about "no good deed."

734
00:33:32,514 --> 00:33:36,633
Okay, so no one at
Waterway Volunteers

735
00:33:36,737 --> 00:33:37,890
has ever heard of you.

736
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:40,282
I'm new. They must have lost
my paperwork.

737
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:41,620
We didn't.

738
00:33:41,737 --> 00:33:43,875
"Xavier Blackburn, 33."

739
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:45,831
Spent six years
as a contractor

740
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:47,789
for a private military
firm in Arlington.

741
00:33:47,874 --> 00:33:49,375
Until you were fired

742
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,120
because of
behavioral issues.

743
00:33:52,205 --> 00:33:54,140
"Increasingly
violent outbursts

744
00:33:54,225 --> 00:33:57,086
and blatant disregard
for protocol."

745
00:33:57,181 --> 00:33:59,282
I had an occasional disagreement

746
00:33:59,447 --> 00:34:01,782
with a few short-sighted
superiors.

747
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:03,657
I'm sure you can relate.

748
00:34:05,072 --> 00:34:06,277
Nice truck.

749
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:09,706
At least it was.
We... we tracked it down

750
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:11,039
to a body shop
near your house.

751
00:34:11,124 --> 00:34:12,269
And guess what.

752
00:34:12,354 --> 00:34:16,657
The paint on your bumper was
a match to Wesley Moore's car.

753
00:34:17,643 --> 00:34:19,950
Moore stole U.S. intelligence.

754
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,476
Did you know that?

755
00:34:21,565 --> 00:34:24,011
He was a risk
to national security

756
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:25,107
and needed to be stopped.

757
00:34:25,192 --> 00:34:27,250
Moore was investigating
an American

758
00:34:27,335 --> 00:34:29,047
who was aiding the Taliban.

759
00:34:31,744 --> 00:34:33,933
He wasn't the traitor,
genius.

760
00:34:34,018 --> 00:34:37,274
No, you're wrong.
He told me Moore was dangerous.

761
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:39,245
- He?
- He said that

762
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,882
if I neutralized
the threat,

763
00:34:40,967 --> 00:34:43,930
he would reinstate me,
and I would get my job back.

764
00:34:44,322 --> 00:34:45,883
Who gave you the order?

765
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:50,797
The patrol will leave
at 0500 hours.

766
00:34:50,908 --> 00:34:52,586
Jennings,
you're driving lead.

767
00:34:52,671 --> 00:34:55,149
Dunne and Falconio,
you're on the flank.

768
00:34:55,234 --> 00:34:56,636
- Kinneman.
- Yeah.

769
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:59,383
Keep your eyes peeled
for insurgent activity.

770
00:34:59,468 --> 00:35:01,753
Rumors of Atwa's death
are no doubt

771
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:04,995
circulating throughout the city,
so retribution is expected.

772
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,351
You're right about that.

773
00:35:06,436 --> 00:35:09,253
I'm sorry, Agents,
but this is a secure briefing.

774
00:35:09,338 --> 00:35:10,734
It's too late
for that, General.

775
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:12,898
Your patrol route's
already been compromised,

776
00:35:12,983 --> 00:35:15,336
- and not by us.
- What are you talking about?

777
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,992
Go ahead, tell 'em.

778
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,995
I don't know
what you mean.

779
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,298
All right,
I'll give you a hint.

780
00:35:21,383 --> 00:35:23,132
One word, begins
with the letter "T."

781
00:35:23,217 --> 00:35:24,320
Rhymes with "reason."

782
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:27,323
Well, someone better start
making sense real soon.

783
00:35:27,408 --> 00:35:30,126
Kinneman here was leaking
your transport routes

784
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,672
to Aazar Atwa.

785
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:36,461
That's a lie.

786
00:35:36,627 --> 00:35:38,518
Really?
All right.

787
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,164
Does this guy look familiar?

788
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:42,491
Your former coworker
and accomplice,

789
00:35:42,576 --> 00:35:43,901
Xavier Blackburn?

790
00:35:43,986 --> 00:35:45,339
He's in NCIS custody.

791
00:35:45,424 --> 00:35:47,031
Gave you up in record time.

792
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:49,109
Do... do not
listen to them.

793
00:35:49,194 --> 00:35:50,464
This is a setup.

794
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:52,932
Kinneman's a military
contractor.

795
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:54,991
Why would he be helping
the Taliban?

796
00:35:55,076 --> 00:35:56,178
Simple economics.

797
00:35:56,263 --> 00:35:58,038
U.S. forces
pull out of Kabul,

798
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,660
his lucrative
defense contracts disappear.

799
00:36:00,745 --> 00:36:02,589
If enemy attacks
increase in the area,

800
00:36:02,674 --> 00:36:04,554
U.S. military strengthens
their presence,

801
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:05,770
securing your funding.

802
00:36:05,855 --> 00:36:08,284
So you started passing intel
to Atwa

803
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:10,192
on certain convoys
to attack.

804
00:36:10,277 --> 00:36:11,854
But Captain Voit
started digging around,

805
00:36:11,939 --> 00:36:13,194
and you had to
put an end to it.

806
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:15,370
Then you had Atwa
strike Voit's convoy.

807
00:36:15,455 --> 00:36:17,800
Then you shot Atwa before
he could give you up.

808
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,124
Easy target for someone

809
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:21,672
with advanced sniper training,
such as yourself.

810
00:36:21,783 --> 00:36:23,204
Come on, Kinneman,

811
00:36:23,736 --> 00:36:25,797
these guys deserve
to know.

812
00:36:26,072 --> 00:36:28,406
How much were those
Marines' lives worth, huh?

813
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:30,703
Five million?
Ten?

814
00:36:35,338 --> 00:36:37,463
It wasn't about money.

815
00:36:37,548 --> 00:36:39,151
- <i>Are you kidding me?!</i>
- If the military withdraws

816
00:36:39,236 --> 00:36:41,658
and the Taliban takes control
of this area again,

817
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:43,937
then what were the last
15 years of fighting even for?

818
00:36:44,022 --> 00:36:46,195
Hey, 14 people are
dead because of you.

819
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,586
You're as much a terrorist
as anyone like Atwa.

820
00:36:48,671 --> 00:36:50,539
Put your hands
behind your back.

821
00:37:08,665 --> 00:37:10,702
Hey, Doctor, I need
your signature

822
00:37:10,787 --> 00:37:12,749
on this body transfer.

823
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:17,081
What's going on? I am properly

824
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:19,281
displaying your artwork.

825
00:37:19,366 --> 00:37:23,176
All these should be
shown and admired.

826
00:37:23,613 --> 00:37:25,683
I can't believe
that you did this.

827
00:37:25,863 --> 00:37:27,231
I am touched.

828
00:37:27,316 --> 00:37:30,027
Oh, consider it
a parting gift.

829
00:37:31,794 --> 00:37:34,011
Parting gift?
You going somewhere?

830
00:37:34,096 --> 00:37:35,394
Indeed I am.

831
00:37:35,498 --> 00:37:39,592
You can call it
a globetrotting adventure.

832
00:37:40,248 --> 00:37:43,090
But you just got back.

833
00:37:43,654 --> 00:37:46,167
You have proven yourself
more than capable

834
00:37:46,252 --> 00:37:49,097
in the last year,
Dr. Palmer.

835
00:37:49,182 --> 00:37:51,183
I have no doubt that
you'll continue

836
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:53,487
to hold the fort while I'm gone.

837
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:57,447
Sure, but you will
be back, right?

838
00:37:57,532 --> 00:37:58,702
Of course.

839
00:37:58,787 --> 00:38:00,921
And when I return
in the new year,

840
00:38:01,037 --> 00:38:04,097
I shall have many more
stories to relate.

841
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,624
Well, that's great.

842
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:07,799
What's the first stop
on your vacation gonna be?

843
00:38:07,884 --> 00:38:09,144
Something, uh, exotic?

844
00:38:09,229 --> 00:38:12,246
Maybe... the pyramids,
Great Wall of China?

845
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,777
The Serengeti?

846
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:15,710
Mount Rushmore.

847
00:38:16,302 --> 00:38:19,426
South Dakota.
In the middle of winter.

848
00:38:19,511 --> 00:38:20,668
Mm. Hmm.

849
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,558
You are one in a million,
Doctor.

850
00:38:24,655 --> 00:38:26,006
True.

851
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:34,691
Thank you for your
cooperation, Colonel.

852
00:38:35,553 --> 00:38:38,421
You know, this escort
mission has top priority.

853
00:38:38,506 --> 00:38:40,136
I should be the one
thanking you, Gibbs.

854
00:38:40,221 --> 00:38:42,194
Those responsible
for Captain Voit's death

855
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:43,448
have been brought
to justice.

856
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:46,457
I only wish that could happen
for every fallen service member.

857
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,314
What time is the
captain's funeral?

858
00:38:49,597 --> 00:38:51,931
0900 hours tomorrow.

859
00:38:52,472 --> 00:38:54,486
Strathmere, New Jersey.

860
00:38:54,571 --> 00:38:57,056
That's about a five-hour drive.
Looking for a navigator?

861
00:38:58,141 --> 00:39:00,246
You have your go-bag, Gunny?

862
00:39:00,331 --> 00:39:02,392
Already packed.
It's in the car.

863
00:39:03,293 --> 00:39:05,376
Company would be nice.

864
00:39:06,128 --> 00:39:07,926
I know Voit would
appreciate having

865
00:39:08,011 --> 00:39:09,571
another Marine there
to see her off.

866
00:39:09,656 --> 00:39:11,253
My honor.

867
00:39:11,936 --> 00:39:15,533
You would have really
liked her, Gibbs.

868
00:39:15,843 --> 00:39:18,414
She was as determined
as they come.

869
00:39:18,587 --> 00:39:20,939
Never backed down from a fight.

870
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,519
Shall we?

871
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:54,465
Yeah.

872
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:08,950
Rest easy, Marine.

873
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:11,646
We got the watch.

874
00:40:33,242 --> 00:40:36,269
