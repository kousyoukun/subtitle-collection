1
00:00:02,977 --> 00:00:04,643
You take every case
personally, too.

2
00:00:04,712 --> 00:00:06,979
(quietly): Enough.
- No, Rule Ten-- it's B.S.

3
00:00:07,047 --> 00:00:09,683
<i>"Never get personally involved</i>
<i>on a case."</i>

4
00:00:09,684 --> 00:00:13,452
Rule Ten served as a
firewall to your feelings.

5
00:00:13,521 --> 00:00:15,020
They're both dead.

6
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,189
FRANKS: <i>Your wife and daughter died</i>
<i>in the crash.</i>

7
00:00:17,258 --> 00:00:18,924
MAN:
<i>I'm terribly sorry, Jethro.</i>

8
00:00:18,993 --> 00:00:20,526
(thunder cracks)

9
00:00:20,594 --> 00:00:21,671
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

10
00:00:21,695 --> 00:00:23,929
(both grunt)

11
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:29,334
You expose this
witness, it ends me.

12
00:00:29,403 --> 00:00:31,136
FBI Agent Tobias Fornell.

13
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:32,482
You think there's anything
you could say

14
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:33,506
that would surprise us?

15
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:36,275
I killed the man
who killed my family.

16
00:00:36,343 --> 00:00:38,177
- You're barely hanging on.
VANCE: <i>Gibbs!</i>

17
00:00:38,245 --> 00:00:41,847
It's Fornell. You need to get
to Mercy Point Hospital fast.

18
00:00:44,018 --> 00:00:45,951
(tires screeching)

19
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,401
(panting):
You're gonna miss the turn.

20
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:52,558
(horn honking)

21
00:00:52,626 --> 00:00:55,527
(tires screeching)

22
00:00:55,596 --> 00:00:57,229
Careful!
(panting)

23
00:00:57,298 --> 00:00:58,675
Need a little more
warning next time!

24
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:00,666
You're gonna be okay, Fornell.

25
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:02,134
We're almost there.

26
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,270
I've never seen

27
00:01:04,305 --> 00:01:06,004
anyone this blue before.

28
00:01:06,073 --> 00:01:07,739
Hurry.

29
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,516
Hey!

30
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:18,717
We need help!

31
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:20,786
In the back!
Come on.

32
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:21,987
Hurry, hurry.

33
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:24,156
Okay, we're at the hospital.
You're going to be fine.

34
00:01:24,225 --> 00:01:25,791
- What happened?
- I don't know.

35
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,870
Uh, one second
she's laughing,

36
00:01:26,894 --> 00:01:28,238
and the next,
she's laying on the ground.

37
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:30,729
What's her name?
Emily. Emily Fornell.

38
00:01:30,798 --> 00:01:32,831
- Emily?
SPENCER: Come on...

39
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,399
Can you hear me? Emily.

40
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:36,401
Nothing. I can't find a pulse.

41
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,603
Call the cardiac team.

42
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:38,748
Counting for chest compressions.

43
00:01:38,772 --> 00:01:40,539
One, two, three...

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,975
Hey.

49
00:02:17,044 --> 00:02:18,044
Tobias.

50
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:20,008
Gibbs.

51
00:02:21,282 --> 00:02:22,781
You're here.
Thank you. Thank God.

52
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,816
Hey, we came as soon
as we heard.

53
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:26,818
Where's Emily, huh?

54
00:02:26,887 --> 00:02:29,054
Hey, Jack.
With the doctors.

55
00:02:29,123 --> 00:02:30,446
What happened?

56
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,317
She was at some
college party.

57
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,102
I guess she collapsed.

58
00:02:33,103 --> 00:02:36,370
They said she was
blue, Gibbs. Blue.

59
00:02:36,438 --> 00:02:38,939
- And what are they saying now?
- They don't know.

60
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:40,485
It could be anything
between a bee sting

61
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:41,875
and a pulmonary embolism.

62
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:43,310
Her lungs are fine,

63
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:44,923
but we finished running
her blood, and...

64
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:45,947
She's gonna be okay?

65
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:47,981
We've stabilized her, yes,

66
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,816
but she is still in
critical condition.

67
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,385
I want to see her.

68
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:52,453
Of course.

69
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:56,790
- You family?
- Uncle.

70
00:02:56,859 --> 00:02:58,392
Then you should
probably come with.

71
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:01,762
Okay.

72
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:15,442
I'm here, baby.

73
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:19,446
I'm here.

74
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:27,988
Why is she on a ventilator?

75
00:03:28,057 --> 00:03:29,723
She wasn't getting
enough oxygen.

76
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,606
I thought you said
it wasn't her lungs.

77
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,160
Correct.

78
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:34,861
We were able to rule out a
pulmonary event rather quickly.

79
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,630
So what is it?

80
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:40,167
Has your daughter undergone
any surgeries recently?

81
00:03:40,235 --> 00:03:42,636
FORNELL:
No.

82
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:45,105
Been prescribed any medication
for any pain syndromes?

83
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:46,473
No.

84
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:48,508
You got something to say,
say it.

85
00:03:49,912 --> 00:03:52,212
Your daughter overdosed
on opioids.

86
00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:53,714
(stammers)

87
00:03:55,584 --> 00:03:56,995
Where did you get
your medical degree?

88
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:59,453
I know it's a hard
thing to hear,

89
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:01,032
but right now we've
got bigger problems.

90
00:04:01,056 --> 00:04:03,790
Bigger than telling me that
my daughter is a dope addict?

91
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:04,451
Tobias...

92
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:06,194
I never suggested
she's an addict,

93
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:08,862
but that's a tomorrow
problem. Right now

94
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:10,797
we have a right-now problem.

95
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:12,833
She's not responding
to naloxone.

96
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:15,235
- It's a drug that we use...
- I know what it is!

97
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:18,538
Something you give
to dope addicts.

98
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:20,240
She appears to
be allergic.

99
00:04:20,309 --> 00:04:21,786
It's caused a cascade response
in her vascular system.

100
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,678
That's interfering
with her sinus rhythm.

101
00:04:24,747 --> 00:04:26,313
What does that mean?

102
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:29,249
We are walking
a very fine line.

103
00:04:29,318 --> 00:04:33,153
Too much antidote, and we could
stop your daughter's heart.

104
00:04:33,222 --> 00:04:36,823
Too little, and she
could asphyxiate.

105
00:04:36,892 --> 00:04:39,393
No.

106
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:41,139
You have to prepare yourself
for the possibility

107
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:43,330
she won't survive the night.
- No.

108
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,076
But rest assured, we are doing
everything in our power to...

109
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,433
Everything in our power?!

110
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:48,268
Hey, hey.

111
00:04:48,337 --> 00:04:49,781
Then why are you
the only one standing here?

112
00:04:49,805 --> 00:04:52,339
Why is my little girl
alone in this room

113
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:53,688
when you've got a whole building

114
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:55,120
full of brainiacs
with medical degrees?

115
00:04:55,144 --> 00:04:56,056
Mr. Fornell...

116
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,445
And how many more
at home sleeping?

117
00:04:57,446 --> 00:05:00,080
So why don't you wake
their sorry asses up

118
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:03,784
and tell them to get in here and
figure this out? Do you hear me?

119
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:06,586
All hands on deck!

120
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:09,456
So no more standing around.
Get to work.

121
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:11,391
And save my daughter's life!

122
00:05:24,472 --> 00:05:26,739
Look, I'm not gonna
press charges.

123
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:28,507
I appreciate it.

124
00:05:28,576 --> 00:05:30,576
I get it.
I really do.

125
00:05:32,146 --> 00:05:34,146
And he looks like
he's calmed down now.

126
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:35,481
It won't happen again.

127
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,183
No, it won't.

128
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:39,251
If he wants
to be let back inside,

129
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,487
he's gonna need
to leave his bazooka at home.

130
00:05:45,994 --> 00:05:47,727
Hey, how's she doing?

131
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:51,097
- Same. Sloane's with her.
- And Fornell?

132
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:54,867
Yeah. We should probably
hang on to this for a while.

133
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:57,536
We stopped by that college
party like you asked.

134
00:05:57,605 --> 00:05:58,916
TORRES:
And talked to Emily's friends.

135
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,206
BISHOP:
They said there's no way

136
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:01,941
she would have taken anything.

137
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,310
They think
maybe her drink was spiked.

138
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:05,859
Apparently
that's been happening a lot

139
00:06:05,913 --> 00:06:07,313
on her campus lately.

140
00:06:07,382 --> 00:06:09,615
So not an overdose.

141
00:06:09,684 --> 00:06:11,951
A crime.

142
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,487
It's not our jurisdiction,
but we alerted Campus P.D.

143
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:15,555
They're all over it.

144
00:06:15,623 --> 00:06:17,857
FORNELL:
I said I want them all.

145
00:06:17,925 --> 00:06:19,336
Is something wrong
with your hearing?

146
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,060
Yeah, I heard you,
but the answer's no.

147
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:22,962
There a problem?

148
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:26,198
Yeah. I would like
to buy my daughter some flowers,

149
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:28,567
and this jackass
is giving me a hard time.

150
00:06:28,636 --> 00:06:30,970
He wants them all.
I told Grumpelstiltskin here

151
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,539
he's more than welcome
to purchase up to two.

152
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:35,019
And you are more
than welcome to take those two

153
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:36,353
and shove them up your...
- Tobias, hey, come on.

154
00:06:36,377 --> 00:06:37,410
- Two.
- Come on.

155
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:38,411
- Sorry.
- Let's go.

156
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,546
I'm not really!

157
00:06:40,615 --> 00:06:42,548
What kind
of hospital pharmacy

158
00:06:42,617 --> 00:06:44,316
has a limit
on flower arrangements?

159
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:46,485
It wasn't an overdose.

160
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:49,588
She was drugged.

161
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,325
I suppose that should
make me feel better.

162
00:06:53,394 --> 00:06:55,361
Except now
I want my gun back.

163
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,229
Campus P.D.-- they're on it.

164
00:06:57,298 --> 00:06:59,543
Campus P.D. Wouldn't trust them
to write a jaywalking ticket.

165
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:00,944
Gibbs, I know
you haven't been playing

166
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:02,334
with a full deck lately,

167
00:07:02,403 --> 00:07:04,503
but you need
to get your ass down to...

168
00:07:04,572 --> 00:07:06,939
And you need to get
your head in the game.

169
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:10,543
Emily needs you, Tobias.
Your daughter needs you.

170
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:12,322
What you need to do is
go upstairs right now

171
00:07:12,346 --> 00:07:14,046
and sit by her bed.

172
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:16,949
And I'm gonna go home and
pick up some clothes for you.

173
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:19,051
And you're not gonna
yell at anybody,

174
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,053
and you're not
gonna shoot anybody.

175
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:22,455
Got it?

176
00:07:22,523 --> 00:07:23,889
Got it.

177
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:28,594
Where you going now?

178
00:07:28,663 --> 00:07:30,129
To find some nail polish.

179
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:42,408
(sniffs)

180
00:07:57,358 --> 00:07:59,959
DIANE:
Yeah, that's a great idea.

181
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:03,295
I mean, it's not like Tobias has
a drinking problem or anything.

182
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:06,765
Go ahead and shoot.

183
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:08,834
See if I care. I'm already dead.

184
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:10,603
Oh, and thanks for
that, by the way.

185
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:12,171
Ruined my favorite
wool coat.

186
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,175
Got blood all over it. Dick.

187
00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:17,810
This is not happening.

188
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:20,412
(laughing):
Yes. Yeah, it's happening.

189
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:23,415
The question you really
have to ask yourself is,

190
00:08:23,484 --> 00:08:25,184
what's happening?

191
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:28,154
Yeah, I'm asking.

192
00:08:28,222 --> 00:08:30,456
Here's a hint. You're talking
to your dead ex-wife.

193
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:32,091
It's usually a red flag.

194
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,426
But the real question is,
what are you doing

195
00:08:34,495 --> 00:08:36,195
being a cabana boy

196
00:08:36,264 --> 00:08:37,530
instead of going to find

197
00:08:37,598 --> 00:08:38,998
the punk who dosed
my little girl?

198
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:41,867
What? Excuse me!

199
00:08:41,936 --> 00:08:43,936
Tobias doesn't need
your old boxers.

200
00:08:44,005 --> 00:08:46,205
He needs <i>you</i> on the job.

201
00:08:46,274 --> 00:08:49,175
This case is not even
NCIS jurisdiction.

202
00:08:49,243 --> 00:08:51,010
How did you ever father a child

203
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:53,212
with such a little,
tiny, shriveled....?

204
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:55,814
I am not doing this.
I'm not doing this.

205
00:09:01,622 --> 00:09:03,122
Looks like we might
be doing this.

206
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,530
Why does this stairwell smell
like burnt cheese?

207
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:13,933
What do you want from me?

208
00:09:13,968 --> 00:09:17,736
I want
what my other ex-husband wants.

209
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:20,306
I want you to find the guy
who drugged our daughter.

210
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:23,342
It's not that simple.

211
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:28,380
Oh, you have got to let
this Rule Ten nonsense go.

212
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:31,150
So you're personally
involved in the case.

213
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:34,486
Big deal. You also have
no fashion sense. Life goes on.

214
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:39,425
When you get personally
involved, you make mistakes.

215
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:41,493
No, that is just
a big fat excuse

216
00:09:41,562 --> 00:09:43,140
for the real problem here,
and you know it.

217
00:09:43,164 --> 00:09:46,732
You are running, Jethro.

218
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:48,834
You're running scared.

219
00:09:48,903 --> 00:09:51,870
So you need to ask yourself--
are you a man or a mouse?

220
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:55,241
'Cause if you're a man,
get your head in the game!

221
00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:01,380
I want Emily Fornell's case.

222
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:03,048
Took you long enough.

223
00:10:03,117 --> 00:10:04,683
I already wasted
too much time.

224
00:10:04,752 --> 00:10:06,518
All right, well,
I'll skip my prepared speech

225
00:10:06,587 --> 00:10:08,354
and go right
to the highlight reel. No.

226
00:10:08,422 --> 00:10:10,756
Leon, whoever drugged her
is still out there.

227
00:10:10,825 --> 00:10:12,258
They did it before.

228
00:10:12,326 --> 00:10:13,726
They are gonna do it again.

229
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:15,794
Almost a dozen
cases last month.

230
00:10:15,863 --> 00:10:17,463
Next time could be a lot worse.

231
00:10:17,531 --> 00:10:21,267
As much as I would love
to unleash you on the bastard

232
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:23,702
that did this to Emily,
I cannot sanction it.

233
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:25,491
- Come on!
- Gibbs, your personal connection

234
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:28,707
to this case is bad enough, and
with the lack of jurisdiction,

235
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:32,211
that's a good way to get us
all fired and probably worse.

236
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,647
Duck!

237
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:36,315
Jurisdiction--
or in Latin,

238
00:10:36,384 --> 00:10:38,884
<i>iuris dicende causa--</i>

239
00:10:38,953 --> 00:10:40,919
the administration of justice.

240
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:43,389
It came into use
in the latter part

241
00:10:43,457 --> 00:10:44,935
of the 14th century...
- Skip ahead, Duck.

242
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,392
Ah, right.

243
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,594
Last year
the owner of the property

244
00:10:48,663 --> 00:10:51,230
where the alleged criminal act
occurred

245
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:52,731
hired a contractor

246
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,967
to add a second story.
Unfortunately,

247
00:10:55,036 --> 00:10:58,637
the contractor sued the
property owner for fraud.

248
00:10:58,706 --> 00:11:01,440
That case is
now in court.

249
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:02,841
Mm-hmm.

250
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,977
Last month, however,

251
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:08,580
this same contractor
was hired,

252
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:09,848
but this time

253
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:12,251
on a Navy off-base house.

254
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,819
I see.

255
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:15,187
So, now...

256
00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:18,757
this Navy contractor

257
00:11:18,826 --> 00:11:20,326
is in a legal dispute...

258
00:11:20,394 --> 00:11:23,429
Stop. You had me
at <i>iuris dicende causa.</i>

259
00:11:23,497 --> 00:11:24,596
Yes,

260
00:11:24,665 --> 00:11:25,831
it's within
our purview

261
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,932
to investigate

262
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:28,334
when one of our contractors

263
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:29,642
is involved
in a criminal probe.

264
00:11:30,438 --> 00:11:32,204
However tangential.

265
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,274
We good to go?

266
00:11:35,343 --> 00:11:37,142
Torres, talk
to any other victims.

267
00:11:37,211 --> 00:11:39,111
Bishop, McGee,

268
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,613
interview everyone
who was at the party.

269
00:11:41,682 --> 00:11:43,982
(phone rings)

270
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:49,154
See if there's
any cell phone footage.

271
00:11:49,223 --> 00:11:51,156
Chapsnats. Whatever.

272
00:11:51,225 --> 00:11:52,424
On it.

273
00:11:52,493 --> 00:11:55,160
Tell Sloane to work up
a profile on our suspect.

274
00:11:55,229 --> 00:11:56,795
Is everything okay?

275
00:11:56,864 --> 00:11:58,727
What do you think
that was about?

276
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,733
I...

277
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:02,434
Maybe he got
a Chapsnat.

278
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:09,575
(laughing):
I'm not kidding, Dad.

279
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:11,577
I hate flowers.
You never got the memo?

280
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:12,923
What kind of
self-respecting girl

281
00:12:12,947 --> 00:12:14,213
does not like flowers?

282
00:12:14,281 --> 00:12:15,547
That's sexist,

283
00:12:15,616 --> 00:12:16,915
twice over.

284
00:12:18,052 --> 00:12:19,518
Hi, Uncle Gibbs.

285
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:20,986
Hi, Em.

286
00:12:21,055 --> 00:12:22,688
Feeling better?

287
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:24,656
Fine, actually.

288
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:26,859
One minute she looks
like death warmed over...

289
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:28,594
- Hey!
- and the next she is critiquing

290
00:12:28,662 --> 00:12:30,763
my interior decorating skills.

291
00:12:30,831 --> 00:12:33,999
EMILY: The doctor said they found the
sweet spot with the naloxone.

292
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:36,535
I just... can't believe
this happened to me.

293
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:39,171
- Forget about that.
- I'm so careful, too.

294
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,006
Do you know who did it?
No.

295
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:42,875
Not yet. But we're going to.

296
00:12:42,943 --> 00:12:44,276
Torres is on it.

297
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:46,044
We can forget
about that, too.

298
00:12:46,113 --> 00:12:48,547
You're gonna be okay.

299
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:49,882
That's what's important.

300
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,016
Uh, when you going home?

301
00:12:51,085 --> 00:12:53,051
One more test
and she's all yours.

302
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,219
Nurse?

303
00:12:54,288 --> 00:12:55,888
EMILY (chuckles):
I can walk.

304
00:12:57,591 --> 00:12:59,725
What happened to my toes?

305
00:12:59,794 --> 00:13:01,293
GIBBS:
Looks like

306
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:03,195
your father happened.

307
00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:04,930
I was just returning
the favor.

308
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:07,099
You touch my feet again,
and I'm filing

309
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:09,435
a restraining order.
(chuckles)

310
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:19,912
What was with the 911?

311
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,380
So, Vance gave you
jurisdiction?

312
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:24,583
Well, yeah, but it sounded
like you don't want our help.

313
00:13:24,652 --> 00:13:26,485
Oh, I want.

314
00:13:33,661 --> 00:13:37,262
This-- This opioid thing.
Always made me crazy,

315
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:38,730
but now it's personal.

316
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,799
Right there with you.

317
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:42,067
Some punk drugged
my little girl.

318
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:44,803
Some dealer sold that punk
the drugs.

319
00:13:44,872 --> 00:13:46,738
Promise me
that we will get them.

320
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:47,951
Every single
last one of them.

321
00:13:47,975 --> 00:13:48,985
Yeah, right there with you.

322
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:50,676
The chemist who made
the drugs, his mom,

323
00:13:50,744 --> 00:13:53,412
her dog walker, and screw
probable cause and warrants.

324
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:54,558
We're gonna find them
wherever they are,

325
00:13:54,582 --> 00:13:56,026
and we're gonna put a bullet
in their heads.

326
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,784
I know this is just the fight
you've been itching for.

327
00:13:58,853 --> 00:14:02,621
Promise me. Promise me
we're gonna get them all.

328
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,270
So you didn't actually
see the guy

329
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:16,271
who spiked Emily's drink?

330
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:18,239
I didn't see him
do it, no,

331
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:19,941
but Olivia and Hannah
said they did.

332
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,078
ALEXIS: Uh, tall guy. Was lurking
around her all night.

333
00:14:23,146 --> 00:14:24,446
Had a nose ring.

334
00:14:24,514 --> 00:14:25,514
Do you have a name?

335
00:14:25,582 --> 00:14:27,615
No, but, Spencer,
you talked to him?

336
00:14:27,684 --> 00:14:29,084
Just for a second.

337
00:14:29,152 --> 00:14:30,985
ALEXIS: Can't believe
this happened to Emily.

338
00:14:31,054 --> 00:14:33,321
She doesn't drink,
doesn't smoke.

339
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,923
Is she gonna be okay?

340
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:37,258
Yes. She's already home
from the hospital.

341
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:39,527
McGEE: But this could've been
a whole lot worse.

342
00:14:39,596 --> 00:14:41,463
Is there anything else
you guys can think of?

343
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:44,466
No.
Um...

344
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:46,101
nope.

345
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:49,182
Care to try that answer again?

346
00:14:49,206 --> 00:14:50,405
I found

347
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:51,639
this...

348
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,775
by the bar when we were
cleaning up this morning.

349
00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:58,880
Is there a reason
you didn't mention this sooner?

350
00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:00,982
Because it could be anybody's.

351
00:15:01,051 --> 00:15:02,217
And we didn't want to get

352
00:15:02,285 --> 00:15:03,985
the wrong person in trouble.

353
00:15:04,054 --> 00:15:05,720
- But...
- But...

354
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:07,322
it's possible the person

355
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,691
who spiked Emily's drink
dropped this.

356
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,459
And we definitely
want to get <i>him</i>

357
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:12,694
in trouble.

358
00:15:12,762 --> 00:15:14,496
Well, if this is
what I think it is,

359
00:15:14,564 --> 00:15:16,631
someone's definitely
getting in trouble.

360
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,466
Starting with you two,
if I find out

361
00:15:18,535 --> 00:15:20,969
you're withholding
any other evidence.

362
00:15:21,037 --> 00:15:22,904
Seven of the victims
on her campus

363
00:15:22,973 --> 00:15:24,706
were able to give us
descriptions of the guy

364
00:15:24,808 --> 00:15:25,707
they think
drugged them.

365
00:15:25,775 --> 00:15:27,375
- How many had nose rings?
- One.

366
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:28,206
That's our guy.

367
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,745
Yeah, now all we got to do
is just find him.

368
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:31,679
And I can help
with that.

369
00:15:31,748 --> 00:15:32,847
I analyzed the pill

370
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,883
Emily's friend found
at the party.

371
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:37,218
It has the exact same
chemical composition

372
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:38,887
as the opioid
she was drugged with.

373
00:15:38,955 --> 00:15:40,183
Our guy must've dropped it.

374
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:41,757
Any DNA?

375
00:15:41,758 --> 00:15:43,302
Uh, nothing usable.
But... through the magic

376
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:45,326
of chemical science,
I still

377
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:48,730
have a lead. The pill
is not pharmaceutical grade.

378
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:50,431
Take a look at
the optical isomers...

379
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,533
No.

380
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:52,934
Yeah, we're not gonna do that.

381
00:15:53,003 --> 00:15:55,170
Oh, right, I forgot.
You're both Level IIs.

382
00:15:55,238 --> 00:15:57,672
Bottom line, this
is a bootleg drug.

383
00:15:57,741 --> 00:15:58,873
And if we can figure out

384
00:15:58,942 --> 00:16:01,009
where this drink-spiking jerk
got it...

385
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:02,410
It might lead
back to him.

386
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:03,411
Kase,

387
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,746
good work.

388
00:16:04,814 --> 00:16:07,549
Torres, BOLO on the pill.

389
00:16:07,617 --> 00:16:09,884
See if it shows up
in any other drug busts.

390
00:16:09,953 --> 00:16:12,754
And don't mention
any of this to Fornell.

391
00:16:12,822 --> 00:16:14,022
Copy that.

392
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,290
Fornell?

393
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:16,858
Level II?

394
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:19,527
(typing)

395
00:16:19,596 --> 00:16:21,062
"Fifth-grade

396
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:22,564
science or lower"?

397
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:25,400
Okay, I'll take that.

398
00:16:25,468 --> 00:16:27,702
Why can't we mention
this to Fornell?

399
00:16:27,771 --> 00:16:29,370
Well, what would your dad do
to some guy

400
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,538
who tried to drug you?

401
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:32,974
Probably the same thing
that <i>you'd</i> do

402
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:35,043
if someone tried
to do that to Bishop.

403
00:16:37,614 --> 00:16:38,614
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

404
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:42,817
Here. You're late.

405
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:44,719
Meatloaf is
getting cold.

406
00:16:44,788 --> 00:16:46,154
It wasn't much better warm.

407
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:48,063
You're more than welcome
to cook our next meal.

408
00:16:48,725 --> 00:16:50,792
Here.

409
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,293
Have a date rape straw.

410
00:16:52,362 --> 00:16:53,628
It can detect five

411
00:16:53,697 --> 00:16:57,065
common sedatives. A gift
from my helicopter parent.

412
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:59,663
Sounds like
a <i>smart</i> parent.

413
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:01,036
Well, can you please

414
00:17:01,037 --> 00:17:02,937
tell him that I'm fine?
It happened,

415
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:04,906
it's over. I would like
to put this behind me.

416
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:06,441
He is right here.

417
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:08,810
And the best defense
is a good offense.

418
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:11,946
Says the man who put
a five-pound dongle

419
00:17:12,015 --> 00:17:13,448
on my key chain.
- Yeah.

420
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:15,617
Pepper spray.
It'll stop a bear.

421
00:17:15,685 --> 00:17:19,120
Ooh. Almost forgot.
(sighs)

422
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:20,755
Help.

423
00:17:20,824 --> 00:17:22,957
DIANE:
For once I'm with Tobias.

424
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:24,192
Back him up.

425
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:25,793
Back him up,
or I'm gonna

426
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:27,262
set up shop
in your bathroom.

427
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,833
Bears can be dangerous.

428
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:32,967
Good boy.

429
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:34,669
FORNELL:
Like it?

430
00:17:34,738 --> 00:17:35,937
It's a blinding
flashlight.

431
00:17:36,006 --> 00:17:37,071
1,000 lumens.

432
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,473
It'll stop a bear, too.

433
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,475
That's it.
I'm leaving.

434
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:41,821
I have a student newspaper
meeting in an hour.

435
00:17:41,845 --> 00:17:43,044
I'll walk you
to the car.

436
00:17:43,113 --> 00:17:44,345
I'll go with.

437
00:17:44,414 --> 00:17:47,115
Nobody's coming with.
I can walk myself to my car.

438
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:49,350
And any bear that gets
in my way is a dead man.

439
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:53,321
(sighs)

440
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,989
It was a hell of a lot easier

441
00:17:55,058 --> 00:17:58,226
when I could solve all
of her problems by just

442
00:17:58,295 --> 00:18:01,129
taking her in my arms and
singing "Hush, Little Baby."

443
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:04,332
Ooh! She forgot
the stun gun.

444
00:18:11,107 --> 00:18:12,807
Well?

445
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:14,575
Nope.

446
00:18:15,478 --> 00:18:17,345
No?

447
00:18:17,414 --> 00:18:20,214
So you're just gonna
ignore me now?

448
00:18:20,283 --> 00:18:22,350
Pedro Hernandez.

449
00:18:24,754 --> 00:18:26,587
You never answered
Tobias's question.

450
00:18:26,656 --> 00:18:29,590
Are you gonna
get them?

451
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:31,826
- Get who?
- Don't play dumb.

452
00:18:31,895 --> 00:18:33,561
The punk who drugged
my little girl.

453
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,074
The dealer who gave
the punk the drugs.

454
00:18:35,098 --> 00:18:37,498
- My team's working on it.
- Your team?

455
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:38,900
Mm-hmm.

456
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:41,035
Yeah, your team has
to follow the rules.

457
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:43,316
Sometimes the bad guy gets away
when you follow the rules.

458
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,772
He hasn't gotten away yet.

459
00:18:44,841 --> 00:18:48,242
If it comes to it,
are you going to do for <i>my</i> baby

460
00:18:48,311 --> 00:18:49,744
what you did for yours?

461
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:51,045
What do you want from me?

462
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:52,847
I want to know
who you are!

463
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,916
I don't know who I am!

464
00:18:58,254 --> 00:19:00,188
Who are you
talking to?

465
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:03,624
Nobody.

466
00:19:03,693 --> 00:19:05,426
Yes, you were.

467
00:19:05,495 --> 00:19:08,262
And you had...

468
00:19:08,331 --> 00:19:09,864
I don't know.

469
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:13,434
Your tone.
It was familiar.

470
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:17,705
It was the Diane tone.

471
00:19:20,477 --> 00:19:22,977
Were you having a conversation
with our dead ex-wife?

472
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:23,896
No.

473
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,481
Look, it's
perfectly normal.

474
00:19:25,482 --> 00:19:28,249
People talk
to deceased family members

475
00:19:28,318 --> 00:19:30,385
all the time.

476
00:19:30,453 --> 00:19:32,820
You can be honest about it.

477
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:35,623
Is that
what you were doing?

478
00:19:35,692 --> 00:19:37,959
Yeah, maybe.

479
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:40,395
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

480
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:44,031
You-- you're really going crazy.

481
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,500
(phone ringing)
Going totally crazy.

482
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,821
And you've got
Diane stuck in your head.

483
00:19:47,845 --> 00:19:49,845
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

484
00:19:49,873 --> 00:19:52,240
No. No, that's Fornell.
(laughing continues)

485
00:19:52,308 --> 00:19:55,276
He's fine.
Where?

486
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:56,477
All right. Be there.

487
00:19:56,546 --> 00:19:58,613
I'm fine.
You're not fine.

488
00:19:58,681 --> 00:20:00,481
GIBBS:
<i>Where is he?</i>

489
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,151
Over here.
Police found him passed out.

490
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:04,419
Looks like a drug overdose.

491
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:06,454
Paramedics revived him
with naloxone.

492
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:07,922
They found these
in his pocket.

493
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:11,626
Same triangle mark as the pill
Emily was drugged with.

494
00:20:13,863 --> 00:20:15,296
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

495
00:20:15,365 --> 00:20:16,964
Need to ask
a few questions.

496
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:18,366
Can you take
the cuffs off him?

497
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:20,802
No, this guy's
going to jail.

498
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,069
What's the charge?

499
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,372
Possession of a narcotic
without a prescription.

500
00:20:24,441 --> 00:20:25,940
Was he dealing?

501
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:27,009
No.

502
00:20:27,043 --> 00:20:28,176
Cuffs stay on.

503
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:31,512
You got two minutes.

504
00:20:33,116 --> 00:20:34,882
What'd you want to ask me?

505
00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:37,485
You got a family?

506
00:20:37,554 --> 00:20:39,620
I did.

507
00:20:39,689 --> 00:20:45,026
My wife didn't want the kids
to see me like this, so...

508
00:20:45,094 --> 00:20:47,361
I'm trying to get clean.

509
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,864
I am. It's just...

510
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:51,899
When you're ready...

511
00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:54,869
call me.

512
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,706
So, what'd you really
want to ask me?

513
00:20:58,775 --> 00:21:01,309
Where'd you get these?

514
00:21:01,377 --> 00:21:03,811
The guy's name
is Professor Ralphie.

515
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,881
That's what everyone
calls him, anyway.

516
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,517
Lives by the campus.
Sells to all the kids.

517
00:21:09,586 --> 00:21:11,219
You got an address?

518
00:21:11,254 --> 00:21:13,254
I'll even draw you a map.

519
00:21:13,323 --> 00:21:14,655
(hip hop playing inside)

520
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:17,058
NCIS. Open up.

521
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:18,759
He was a
pharmaceutical rep.

522
00:21:18,828 --> 00:21:22,063
Lost his job for
skimming meds.

523
00:21:25,134 --> 00:21:27,535
(sighing):
Oh, for Pete's sake.

524
00:21:27,604 --> 00:21:29,403
Are you waiting
for an invitation?

525
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,740
Kick it in.
Maybe this'll help.

526
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:36,177
♪ When I stepped in the game,
all of you knew my name ♪

527
00:21:36,246 --> 00:21:38,224
♪ When I leave, I'll be good
long as I got same... ♪

528
00:21:38,248 --> 00:21:39,847
Gibbs...

529
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,048
GIBBS:
Nose ring.

530
00:21:41,117 --> 00:21:43,951
It's our guy.
I'll check the back.

531
00:21:51,094 --> 00:21:52,293
Gibbs?

532
00:22:00,837 --> 00:22:03,204
Hi, Uncle Gibbs.

533
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:17,727
EMILY: If I had known Ralphie
was in trouble,

534
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:19,496
I would've called 911.

535
00:22:19,565 --> 00:22:21,598
The foam cone around
his nose suggests anoxia

536
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:23,033
following
pulmonary edema.

537
00:22:23,102 --> 00:22:25,068
In layman's terms, that is...

538
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:26,503
Heroin overdose.

539
00:22:26,572 --> 00:22:28,505
I don't get it.

540
00:22:28,574 --> 00:22:30,540
He told me
he doesn't touch the stuff.

541
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:34,111
Needle in his arm
suggests otherwise.

542
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:35,946
Dust for prints.

543
00:22:36,014 --> 00:22:37,981
What are you gonna tell my dad?

544
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,717
Question is,
what are <i>you</i> gonna tell him?

545
00:22:40,786 --> 00:22:42,285
It's not what you think.

546
00:22:42,354 --> 00:22:44,114
I just came by to pick up
a little something,

547
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,522
and Ralphie invited me

548
00:22:45,591 --> 00:22:49,192
to party,
so I stayed.

549
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:53,130
So he didn't spike your drink
the other night, did he?

550
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,566
Is he your boyfriend?

551
00:22:56,635 --> 00:22:57,801
No.

552
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,603
He's your dealer.

553
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:01,404
FORNELL:
Your what?

554
00:23:01,473 --> 00:23:03,607
Your dealer?

555
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:06,109
- My daughter has a dealer?
- Dad, calm down.

556
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:07,544
Oh, Dad is not calming down.

557
00:23:07,613 --> 00:23:09,146
Then back off.
He's just a friend.

558
00:23:09,214 --> 00:23:10,914
Everything is under control.

559
00:23:10,983 --> 00:23:13,283
Really? Almost dying
in the ER one day

560
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:15,385
and getting high
with a corpse the next

561
00:23:15,454 --> 00:23:17,220
is your idea of "under control"?

562
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:18,989
What does out of control
look like?

563
00:23:19,057 --> 00:23:21,158
You need help, Emily.

564
00:23:21,226 --> 00:23:23,160
My life is none
of your business.

565
00:23:23,228 --> 00:23:24,561
None of my what?

566
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:30,167
I am the only parent
that you have left,

567
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:32,502
in case you didn't notice.
- How dare you?

568
00:23:32,571 --> 00:23:34,171
(exhales)

569
00:23:35,908 --> 00:23:37,107
You get back here.

570
00:23:37,176 --> 00:23:38,808
Boss, we got a problem.

571
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:40,577
You think?

572
00:23:40,646 --> 00:23:42,279
No, the syringe.

573
00:23:42,347 --> 00:23:44,414
There's no prints on it.
It's been wiped clean.

574
00:23:44,483 --> 00:23:45,493
JIMMY:
Yeah, and check this out.

575
00:23:45,517 --> 00:23:47,017
I found a secondary
injection point.

576
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:49,920
Looks like he was jabbed
from behind. Gibbs,

577
00:23:49,988 --> 00:23:52,589
I think this crime scene
was staged.

578
00:23:52,658 --> 00:23:54,591
This wasn't
an accidental overdose.

579
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,426
- It was a murder.
SPENCER: A what?

580
00:23:58,497 --> 00:23:59,529
What are you doing here?

581
00:23:59,598 --> 00:24:01,097
I live here.

582
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:04,267
You live with an opioid dealer
who's got a nose ring?

583
00:24:04,336 --> 00:24:06,870
That slip your mind
when we talked this morning?

584
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:08,819
SPENCER: Do these handcuffs
have to be so tight?

585
00:24:08,874 --> 00:24:10,106
Yes.

586
00:24:10,175 --> 00:24:12,309
This is all a big
misunderstanding.

587
00:24:12,377 --> 00:24:15,445
Great. Can't wait
to hear all about it.

588
00:24:15,514 --> 00:24:17,047
DIANE:
Me, too.

589
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:21,095
(whispering):
You got to be kidding me.

590
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,519
Sorry, what's that, boss?

591
00:24:23,622 --> 00:24:26,056
You got to be kidding me

592
00:24:26,124 --> 00:24:28,725
that this is all
a big misunderstanding.

593
00:24:28,794 --> 00:24:30,727
Yeah, that's real smooth,
Woodchuck.

594
00:24:30,796 --> 00:24:33,163
Excuse me, boss.

595
00:24:33,232 --> 00:24:35,899
Nice watch, McGee.

596
00:24:35,968 --> 00:24:37,701
Thanks. Let's go.

597
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:41,137
- You coming?
- No.

598
00:24:41,206 --> 00:24:44,341
I am most definitely not coming.

599
00:24:49,648 --> 00:24:51,581
All right.

600
00:24:53,085 --> 00:24:55,018
- What now?
- What now?

601
00:24:55,087 --> 00:24:57,821
You mean, besides
my daughter being a drug addict?

602
00:24:59,424 --> 00:25:00,690
And I blame you.

603
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:02,859
Me?!

604
00:25:02,928 --> 00:25:04,694
You're a piece of work, Diane!

605
00:25:04,763 --> 00:25:07,030
When I was killed, Tobias
needed you more than anything,

606
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:08,431
and where were you?

607
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,877
I was right here.
Yeah, "right here,"

608
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:11,835
getting him fired from the FBI.

609
00:25:11,903 --> 00:25:15,705
He was a single father
trying to raise a teenage girl

610
00:25:15,774 --> 00:25:18,541
all by himself,
struggling with alcoholism,

611
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,888
and you take away the one thing
that was keeping him stable?

612
00:25:20,912 --> 00:25:23,580
- And now look what happened.
- I know what happened.

613
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:24,948
Y-You don't think that I know?

614
00:25:25,017 --> 00:25:27,117
- Oh, blah, blah, blah.
- Not a day goes by

615
00:25:27,185 --> 00:25:28,763
that I don't think about what happened.
Yada, yada, yada, tell it

616
00:25:28,787 --> 00:25:30,687
to the judge.

617
00:25:30,756 --> 00:25:32,289
(sighs)

618
00:25:33,425 --> 00:25:36,059
What are we doing here?

619
00:25:36,128 --> 00:25:37,888
You still haven't answered
Tobias's question.

620
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:39,863
And now you haven't
answered mine.

621
00:25:39,931 --> 00:25:41,731
- Which is what?
- Somebody got

622
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,733
my baby hooked on drugs.

623
00:25:43,802 --> 00:25:45,935
And now she's wrapped up
in a murder?

624
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,771
You got a question
in there somewhere?

625
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:51,608
Yeah. If your badge
can't get this guy,

626
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:54,611
are you gonna get him anyway?

627
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,450
This is all your fault.

628
00:26:02,621 --> 00:26:04,554
You owe Tobias.

629
00:26:05,824 --> 00:26:07,757
You owe all of us.

630
00:26:12,331 --> 00:26:13,730
Hey.

631
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,810
(chuckles): I heard about your
famous elevator talks, and,

632
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:20,303
and I was walking by,
a-and I thought I heard...

633
00:26:21,473 --> 00:26:24,941
Yeah, but you're alone,
so, uh...

634
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,221
You know what? I'm just gonna
stand here with my eyes closed

635
00:26:27,245 --> 00:26:28,411
until you walk away.

636
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:34,684
Where you been?

637
00:26:34,753 --> 00:26:36,319
Impounding Ralphie's
car. Where's Emily?

638
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:37,954
I don't know,
she won't talk to me.

639
00:26:38,023 --> 00:26:39,356
But I need to find out

640
00:26:39,424 --> 00:26:41,591
where this started,
who gave her that first pill.

641
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,194
You don't go
straight to dealers.

642
00:26:44,262 --> 00:26:46,262
So I figured I'd come
where the action was.

643
00:26:46,331 --> 00:26:47,997
Yeah.

644
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,540
Okay, what do we know
on the victim?/

645
00:26:49,601 --> 00:26:51,101
Um...
(clears throat)

646
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:53,670
Before Professor Ralphie
was a pharmaceutical rep,

647
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:56,840
he was a student
at Emily's college.

648
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:59,476
Pharmacy school, which
he flunked out of.

649
00:26:59,544 --> 00:27:00,844
Winning.

650
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:02,712
BISHOP: Other than a few
jaywalking tickets,

651
00:27:02,781 --> 00:27:05,482
he's managed to stay
under the radar.

652
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,784
TORRES: Not much in
his credit card statements.

653
00:27:07,853 --> 00:27:10,186
Then again, dealers
are mostly cash.

654
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:12,188
Actually, I...

655
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:15,358
What?

656
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:17,360
Actually, I should go.

657
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:20,630
Try to talk to Emily again.
Maybe she knows something.

658
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:24,200
Okay, who killed him?

659
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:25,535
Rival dealer?

660
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:27,704
Maybe a drug buy gone bad?

661
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:30,707
Oh, my gut says, if we want
to find Ralphie's killer,

662
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:33,309
we find out where he was
getting his supply.

663
00:27:33,378 --> 00:27:35,245
What do you want from me?

664
00:27:35,313 --> 00:27:38,748
We want to know where Ralphie
was getting his supply.

665
00:27:38,817 --> 00:27:41,017
I don't know.

666
00:27:41,086 --> 00:27:43,686
I put an ad on the school
website for a roommate.

667
00:27:43,755 --> 00:27:46,589
Ralphie answered.
I, I hardly know the guy.

668
00:27:46,658 --> 00:27:48,391
Please don't play dumb.

669
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,760
It's so unattractive.

670
00:27:50,829 --> 00:27:54,097
I'm not playing, okay?
I'm an art major.

671
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:56,099
My brother was the smart one.

672
00:27:56,168 --> 00:27:58,212
Well, then, maybe you should
call him up and have him explain

673
00:27:58,236 --> 00:28:00,603
to you obstruction of justice.

674
00:28:00,672 --> 00:28:02,872
Wh-What did I obstruct?

675
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:05,875
Well, for starters, you told me
that Olivia and Hannah

676
00:28:05,944 --> 00:28:08,211
saw someone spike Emily's drink.

677
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,590
McGEE: Except we spoke
to both of them,

678
00:28:09,614 --> 00:28:11,214
and they never said that.

679
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:14,584
Maybe I heard wrong.

680
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:17,420
Or maybe you knew that
Emily had a drug problem.

681
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:19,622
And you were covering up
for her because you knew

682
00:28:19,691 --> 00:28:21,424
that it would lead
back to you.

683
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:24,260
(laughs): O-Okay,
you guys are way off base.

684
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:26,262
Sure, I knew Emily was using,

685
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:27,964
but I didn't know
how bad it had gotten.

686
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:30,533
I would have never introduced
her to Ralphie if I'd known.

687
00:28:30,602 --> 00:28:32,469
Okay, your
"get out of obstruction" card

688
00:28:32,537 --> 00:28:33,903
is about to expire.

689
00:28:33,972 --> 00:28:36,873
Where does your roommate
get his supply?

690
00:28:38,977 --> 00:28:40,710
Going once...

691
00:28:42,113 --> 00:28:44,581
...going twice.
- Whoa-- hey, hey.

692
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:48,284
He got his supply
from some pill-happy doctor

693
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:50,086
that Emily
had introduced him to.

694
00:28:50,155 --> 00:28:51,554
Do you have a name?

695
00:28:51,623 --> 00:28:52,789
No.

696
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:54,491
I-I swear.

697
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,293
But... his office
was in Littleton.

698
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:59,496
He was a podiatrist, I think?

699
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,902
Hey, hello there.
I'm Dr. Berman.

700
00:29:05,971 --> 00:29:07,737
- Tobias Fornell.
- Yeah.

701
00:29:07,806 --> 00:29:09,672
So, uh, my nurse tells
me that you're suffering

702
00:29:09,741 --> 00:29:11,608
from a little, uh, hammertoe?

703
00:29:11,676 --> 00:29:13,243
Been a problem for years.

704
00:29:13,311 --> 00:29:15,271
Oh, okay, well, let's take
a look at it, shall we?

705
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:18,081
By any chance,

706
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:21,417
does my last name
sound familiar to you? Fornell?

707
00:29:21,486 --> 00:29:25,355
No, but, uh, my nurse tells me
that you're a new patient.

708
00:29:25,423 --> 00:29:27,991
I am, but my daughter
used to come here.

709
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:31,361
I dropped her off a few times.
Her name's Emily.

710
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:33,296
Doesn't ring a bell.

711
00:29:33,365 --> 00:29:35,765
Your foot is perfectly normal,
Mr. Fornell.

712
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:37,367
(laughs)

713
00:29:37,435 --> 00:29:41,671
Oh, there is absolutely nothing
normal about me, trust me.

714
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,773
(both chuckle)
I'm here

715
00:29:43,842 --> 00:29:48,611
because I saw your name
on a credit card statement

716
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,847
belonging to a drug dealer.

717
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:54,984
(laughs): I'm not sure
I'm following. Uh...

718
00:29:55,053 --> 00:29:58,021
A drug dealer...

719
00:29:59,724 --> 00:30:02,458
...who's been selling drugs
to my daughter.

720
00:30:02,527 --> 00:30:04,460
It's funny,
isn't it,

721
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:09,966
that both she and he should go
to the same pill-happy doctor.

722
00:30:10,035 --> 00:30:13,303
It's what we call in the biz
a coincidence.

723
00:30:13,371 --> 00:30:16,172
Except maybe it's not.

724
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:17,974
You following?

725
00:30:18,043 --> 00:30:20,243
No.

726
00:30:20,312 --> 00:30:21,678
You'll have to excuse me.

727
00:30:21,746 --> 00:30:23,680
Oh, I will not.

728
00:30:24,749 --> 00:30:27,216
I will not excuse you.

729
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:35,058
I will never excuse you.

730
00:30:45,722 --> 00:30:48,797
Well, no, so I'm confused.
Did you find the doctor or not?

731
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:50,131
Well, it wasn't that hard.

732
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:52,133
There was one podiatrist
in Littleton,

733
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:53,901
but there was a small problem.

734
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,137
What?

735
00:30:56,205 --> 00:30:58,139
Uh, Fornell beat us to him.

736
00:30:58,207 --> 00:31:00,040
He must have seen
something in the squad room

737
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:01,342
that tipped him off.

738
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:03,310
How bad?

739
00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:05,524
We got there just in time,
but Fornell was getting ready

740
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:06,881
to waterboard the guy.

741
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,260
The doc said he's not gonna
press charges...

742
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:10,518
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know the drill.

743
00:31:10,586 --> 00:31:12,520
BERMAN:
<i>I have done nothing wrong.</i>

744
00:31:12,588 --> 00:31:15,189
Your daughter came to me and she
was in pain, so I treated her.

745
00:31:15,258 --> 00:31:17,525
She had a bone spur, you
prescribed her opioids?

746
00:31:17,593 --> 00:31:20,161
- Oh, thank God.
- What do you do for a hangnail, morphine?

747
00:31:20,229 --> 00:31:22,040
Fornell asked me to review
his daughter's medical records.

748
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:23,075
I think I made things worse.

749
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:24,610
- Tobias.
- Have you ever heard of aspirin?

750
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:26,934
Tobias, calm down.
Everybody else, sit down.

751
00:31:27,003 --> 00:31:29,270
Special Agent Gibbs. I only have
one question for you.

752
00:31:31,007 --> 00:31:32,773
You know that guy?

753
00:31:33,609 --> 00:31:34,609
Sit down.

754
00:31:35,745 --> 00:31:36,745
Do you know that guy?

755
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:37,990
Look, your agents have already

756
00:31:38,014 --> 00:31:39,124
told me about your concerns,

757
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:40,681
but I can assure you,
I have

758
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,384
never prescribed anyone
enough opioids for them

759
00:31:43,452 --> 00:31:45,252
to start dealing,
much less this guy.

760
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:47,288
You got my little girl
hooked on drugs.

761
00:31:47,356 --> 00:31:48,800
- I saw him once.
JIMMY: Okay, all right.

762
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,524
It says here
you were Luna Bay Labs'

763
00:31:50,593 --> 00:31:52,026
top prescriber in the district?

764
00:31:52,094 --> 00:31:54,428
Got a free trip to Cancun.

765
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:56,241
Her friends said that
she'd never touched the stuff

766
00:31:56,265 --> 00:31:58,199
until you prescribed
it. And for what?

767
00:31:58,267 --> 00:31:59,567
To work on your tan?

768
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,403
Everything I've done

769
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:05,072
is perfectly legal,
so if your drug dealers

770
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:08,108
are selling drugs, they're
getting it from someplace else.

771
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:10,477
And-- yeah, and you are free
to audit my records

772
00:32:10,546 --> 00:32:12,413
if you don't believe me.

773
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:26,227
(knocking on door)

774
00:32:29,332 --> 00:32:31,131
Hey.

775
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,967
You done auditing
those records?

776
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:34,335
What's taking you so long?

777
00:32:34,403 --> 00:32:36,470
Working on it.

778
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:39,406
Thought you and Emily were
seeing Dr. Grace tonight.

779
00:32:39,475 --> 00:32:40,608
She won't go.

780
00:32:40,676 --> 00:32:42,176
Found out today

781
00:32:42,245 --> 00:32:44,011
she hasn't been
to class in weeks.

782
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,614
Her school doesn't even have
a student newspaper.

783
00:32:46,682 --> 00:32:48,916
Gibbs, how did I miss this?

784
00:32:48,985 --> 00:32:51,318
How did I totally
and completely miss this?

785
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:52,319
Everybody did.

786
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:53,854
The harder
I try to help her,

787
00:32:53,923 --> 00:32:56,257
the more I'm driving her away.

788
00:32:58,361 --> 00:32:59,927
I am over my head.

789
00:32:59,996 --> 00:33:02,529
I don't know what to do.
I need...

790
00:33:04,433 --> 00:33:06,000
I need her mother.

791
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:14,319
What are the chances
you're really talking to...?

792
00:33:14,343 --> 00:33:16,377
No. No way.

793
00:33:16,445 --> 00:33:19,046
- Just ask her what I should do.
- No.

794
00:33:19,115 --> 00:33:20,315
Tobias, it's not gonna happen.

795
00:33:20,349 --> 00:33:23,050
And tell me what she says.
Easy peasy.

796
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:25,286
Tobias, look,

797
00:33:25,354 --> 00:33:28,489
I'm not really talking
to Diane. I just...

798
00:33:28,557 --> 00:33:31,025
You're losing your mind?
Fine, I'll take that.

799
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:32,333
Because I'm losing my daughter,

800
00:33:32,395 --> 00:33:34,795
and you know what that
will do to me, so if there's...

801
00:33:34,864 --> 00:33:37,064
if there is even
a one-out-of-a-thousand chance

802
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:40,167
that you are talking
to our ex-wife,

803
00:33:40,236 --> 00:33:44,138
then humor me. I beg you because
I'm at the end of my rope.

804
00:33:44,206 --> 00:33:48,976
Jethro, tell me what sh-she says
I should do, please.

805
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:55,349
Okay.

806
00:33:55,418 --> 00:33:57,351
Okay.

807
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,354
- She says...
DIANE: What?

808
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:05,092
What?

809
00:34:08,064 --> 00:34:10,431
Nice to know
things don't change.

810
00:34:10,499 --> 00:34:12,066
Well, certainly
not that sweater.

811
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:14,068
God, I told you to get
rid of that years ago.

812
00:34:16,605 --> 00:34:18,505
What do I do, Diane?

813
00:34:19,608 --> 00:34:23,243
Stop trying to do anything.

814
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:26,013
Take off your Mr. Fix-It hat

815
00:34:26,082 --> 00:34:28,716
and just be there
for your daughter.

816
00:34:28,784 --> 00:34:31,585
That's not very actionable.

817
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:33,687
Emily doesn't need
action right now,

818
00:34:33,756 --> 00:34:36,190
she just needs her father,

819
00:34:36,258 --> 00:34:38,792
not solutions.

820
00:34:38,861 --> 00:34:42,029
You just be...

821
00:34:42,098 --> 00:34:44,798
her father.

822
00:34:44,867 --> 00:34:48,268
I'm sorry
I couldn't protect you.

823
00:34:51,307 --> 00:34:54,408
I'm sorry I didn't answer
the phone that night.

824
00:34:54,477 --> 00:34:56,744
(phone rings)

825
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,279
Yeah. Gibbs.

826
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:00,981
McGEE:
Boss, hey.

827
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,117
We finished auditing
that doctor's records.

828
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:04,318
GIBBS:
And?

829
00:35:04,387 --> 00:35:05,953
He was telling the truth.

830
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,756
He wasn't prescribing enough
pills for Ralphie to deal.

831
00:35:08,824 --> 00:35:11,058
Ralphie was prescribing them
to himself.

832
00:35:11,127 --> 00:35:13,427
Yeah, looks like Ralphie
stole a prescription pad

833
00:35:13,496 --> 00:35:16,397
from the doctor's office,
has been forging scripts.

834
00:35:16,465 --> 00:35:18,665
And then was getting them filled
with a pharmacist

835
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:20,567
who was willing to look
the other way.

836
00:35:20,636 --> 00:35:22,069
Got a name, bring 'em in.

837
00:35:22,138 --> 00:35:23,771
Who?

838
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,206
Time to buy some more flowers.

839
00:35:26,242 --> 00:35:28,509
You're kidding me.
The flower Nazi?

840
00:35:28,577 --> 00:35:29,777
Yup.

841
00:35:31,647 --> 00:35:32,980
Thank you.

842
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,349
Don't mention it,
and by that, I mean...

843
00:35:35,418 --> 00:35:37,084
Never mention it.

844
00:35:37,153 --> 00:35:39,520
I know.

845
00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:41,021
You had to know
the prescriptions

846
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,290
Ralphie was bringing you
were forged.

847
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,927
I mean, tens of thousands
of pills from the same doctor?

848
00:35:46,996 --> 00:35:48,195
You can't prove
what I know.

849
00:35:48,264 --> 00:35:51,131
I can prove that the syringe

850
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,467
that was used to killed Ralphie
was sold in your store.

851
00:35:53,536 --> 00:35:55,936
Yeah, I sell a lot of syringes.

852
00:35:56,005 --> 00:35:57,204
So, what's funny

853
00:35:57,273 --> 00:35:58,972
about this one is
that the murderer

854
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:01,041
tried to, uh, wipe it
of its prints,

855
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,309
but you know what he forgot?

856
00:36:02,378 --> 00:36:04,445
It's not my problem.

857
00:36:04,513 --> 00:36:06,880
He forgot to wipe the needle,

858
00:36:06,949 --> 00:36:09,349
so we were able
to pull touch DNA,

859
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:12,886
and it was yours, in fact,

860
00:36:12,955 --> 00:36:15,122
which kind of makes it
your problem now.

861
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:19,460
Just in time. He is about
to sing like a bird.

862
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,466
Look, it-it was
an accident, okay?

863
00:36:25,534 --> 00:36:27,568
Who's Grumpelstiltskin now?

864
00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:30,070
I-I got worried
when NCIS started

865
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:31,905
poking around.
I went to warn Ralphie,

866
00:36:31,974 --> 00:36:34,975
and things just got out of hand.

867
00:36:35,044 --> 00:36:38,045
And that's case closed,
gentlemen.

868
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,581
This case, yeah,
but if you want

869
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:42,883
to kill the snake,
you got to cut off the head.

870
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:44,885
Gibbs...

871
00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:48,555
...we gonna go
all the way or not?

872
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,667
Don't forget the date.

873
00:37:03,105 --> 00:37:05,038
What now?

874
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:10,110
Look,

875
00:37:10,179 --> 00:37:11,745
it really was an accident.

876
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:14,681
Where'd you get the pills
you sold to Ralphie?

877
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,183
Same place I get
all my pills,

878
00:37:16,252 --> 00:37:18,418
from the pharmaceutical companies.
- No.

879
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:22,856
Emily Fornell had counterfeit
opioids in her blood.

880
00:37:24,193 --> 00:37:26,527
Which means that
you were filling

881
00:37:26,595 --> 00:37:29,963
Ralphie's forged prescription
with gray market pills.

882
00:37:30,032 --> 00:37:32,099
Pills that were
coming across

883
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,201
the border from Canada,

884
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,570
so I hear.

885
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:37,905
From who?

886
00:37:37,973 --> 00:37:40,574
Sounds like Gibbs been
working a side project.

887
00:37:44,713 --> 00:37:46,780
I want a name.

888
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:48,448
No way.

889
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:49,883
You're going to prison
for murder.

890
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,919
You do not want to mess
with this guy.

891
00:37:51,987 --> 00:37:54,288
Oh, yeah, I do.
Yeah, I do. Trust me.

892
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:55,489
Well, I don't.

893
00:37:55,558 --> 00:37:58,592
Maybe I go to prison,
maybe I-I get off.

894
00:37:58,661 --> 00:38:00,727
You're not gonna get off.

895
00:38:00,796 --> 00:38:02,896
I give you that name,
I'm a dead man.

896
00:38:02,965 --> 00:38:07,568
You are already dead.

897
00:38:14,743 --> 00:38:16,577
Emily...

898
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:17,778
I'm going back to my dorm.

899
00:38:17,846 --> 00:38:19,324
I just came by
to pick up a few things.

900
00:38:19,348 --> 00:38:21,348
- We need...
- To see Dr. Grace?

901
00:38:21,417 --> 00:38:24,017
No, we don't, but maybe you do.

902
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:26,086
If you think so.

903
00:38:26,155 --> 00:38:28,155
There's nothing wrong with me.

904
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,457
And nothing that
needs to be fixed.

905
00:38:30,526 --> 00:38:31,925
And there's nothing
for you to do.

906
00:38:31,994 --> 00:38:33,527
All I need from you

907
00:38:33,596 --> 00:38:37,130
is for you to leave me alone!

908
00:38:53,182 --> 00:38:56,450
(softly):
I need help, Daddy.

909
00:38:56,518 --> 00:38:58,885
I know.

910
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:03,490
(crying)

911
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:06,226
I'm so sorry.

912
00:39:06,295 --> 00:39:10,030
I'm so, so sorry.

913
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:12,232
Me, too, baby. Me, too.

914
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:19,139
I love you so much.

915
00:39:21,377 --> 00:39:23,944
- Your mother, too.
- I know.

916
00:39:26,048 --> 00:39:27,381
She told me.

917
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:30,751
When I was in
the hospital,

918
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:32,419
I had a dream
that I saw her.

919
00:39:32,488 --> 00:39:36,523
She said she loved me
to the moon and back

920
00:39:36,592 --> 00:39:40,193
and that Gibbs's house
smelled like burnt cheese.

921
00:39:40,262 --> 00:39:42,896
(laughs)

922
00:39:51,273 --> 00:39:54,541
Yeah, we got him.

923
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,177
And I didn't have to get
all Pedro Hernandez

924
00:39:57,246 --> 00:39:59,179
on anybody, either.

925
00:40:02,284 --> 00:40:05,585
Except you're not done
with this one yet, are you?

926
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,290
Why are you here?

927
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:13,126
Aside from me losing my mind.

928
00:40:13,195 --> 00:40:15,228
Oh, please,

929
00:40:15,297 --> 00:40:18,231
you were never that sane
to begin with.

930
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,134
But why now?

931
00:40:21,203 --> 00:40:24,771
Because you needed a kick
in the pants to take this case.

932
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,606
Remind me why again?

933
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:30,143
When you get
personally involved,

934
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:31,778
you make mistakes.

935
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:33,880
Right.

936
00:40:33,949 --> 00:40:36,750
Except you and I both know
that that rule is crap.

937
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:41,221
The reason that you don't want
to get personally involved

938
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:44,558
is that you're afraid
to feel, Jethro.

939
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:48,462
Ever since your family
was killed,

940
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,298
you shut yourself off

941
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,767
so you wouldn't have
to get hurt again.

942
00:40:53,836 --> 00:40:57,070
And work, the one place
where you were really alive,

943
00:40:57,139 --> 00:40:59,306
well, couldn't have that,

944
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:01,308
so you had to build up walls
there, too.

945
00:41:03,412 --> 00:41:08,081
And that is the reason that
I am really here, Jethro,

946
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,851
'cause now those walls
are starting to crumble.

947
00:41:12,321 --> 00:41:14,254
You're starting
to let people in again,

948
00:41:14,323 --> 00:41:15,522
and it is scary

949
00:41:15,591 --> 00:41:20,861
and, for someone
like you, dangerous.

950
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:25,499
So you reached out for help.

951
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:28,602
Voilà.

952
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:32,038
I'm just talking to myself.

953
00:41:32,107 --> 00:41:34,508
Yeah, maybe,

954
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:37,144
but at least
you're talking.

955
00:41:37,212 --> 00:41:40,614
And when you're ready
to talk some more,

956
00:41:40,682 --> 00:41:43,784
we're all here for you, inside.

957
00:41:43,852 --> 00:41:46,286
All you got to do is ask.

958
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,860
You don't have to face
the danger alone.

959
00:42:03,138 --> 00:42:05,372
(clattering upstairs)

960
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,008
All right, what now?

961
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:16,349
Hello, Gibbs.

962
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,820
No time for pleasantries.

963
00:42:19,888 --> 00:42:21,421
You're in danger.

964
00:42:27,496 --> 00:42:29,863
Well, aren't you gonna
say something?
