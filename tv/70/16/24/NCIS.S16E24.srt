1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:04,043
You take every case
personally, too.

2
00:00:04,112 --> 00:00:06,379
(quietly): Enough.
- No, Rule Ten-- it's B.S.

3
00:00:06,447 --> 00:00:09,083
<i>"Never get personally involved</i>
<i>on a case."</i>

4
00:00:09,084 --> 00:00:12,852
Rule Ten served as a
firewall to your feelings.

5
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:14,420
They're both dead.

6
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:16,589
FRANKS: <i>Your wife and daughter died</i>
<i>in the crash.</i>

7
00:00:16,658 --> 00:00:18,324
MAN:
<i>I'm terribly sorry, Jethro.</i>

8
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,926
(thunder cracks)

9
00:00:19,994 --> 00:00:21,071
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

10
00:00:21,095 --> 00:00:23,329
(both grunt)

11
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:28,734
You expose this
witness, it ends me.

12
00:00:28,803 --> 00:00:30,536
FBI Agent Tobias Fornell.

13
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:31,882
You think there's anything
you could say

14
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:32,906
that would surprise us?

15
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:35,675
I killed the man
who killed my family.

16
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:37,577
- You're barely hanging on.
VANCE: <i>Gibbs!</i>

17
00:00:37,645 --> 00:00:41,247
It's Fornell. You need to get
to Mercy Point Hospital fast.

18
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,351
(tires screeching)

19
00:00:49,324 --> 00:00:50,801
(panting):
You're gonna miss the turn.

20
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:51,958
(horn honking)

21
00:00:52,026 --> 00:00:54,927
(tires screeching)

22
00:00:54,996 --> 00:00:56,629
Careful!
(panting)

23
00:00:56,698 --> 00:00:58,075
Need a little more
warning next time!

24
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,066
You're gonna be okay, Fornell.

25
00:01:00,134 --> 00:01:01,534
We're almost there.

26
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,670
I've never seen

27
00:01:03,705 --> 00:01:05,404
anyone this blue before.

28
00:01:05,473 --> 00:01:07,139
Hurry.

29
00:01:14,983 --> 00:01:16,916
Hey!

30
00:01:16,985 --> 00:01:18,117
We need help!

31
00:01:18,186 --> 00:01:20,186
In the back!
Come on.

32
00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:21,387
Hurry, hurry.

33
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,556
Okay, we're at the hospital.
You're going to be fine.

34
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,191
- What happened?
- I don't know.

35
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,270
Uh, one second
she's laughing,

36
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,638
and the next,
she's laying on the ground.

37
00:01:27,662 --> 00:01:30,129
What's her name?
Emily. Emily Fornell.

38
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:32,231
- Emily?
SPENCER: Come on...

39
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,799
Can you hear me? Emily.

40
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:35,801
Nothing. I can't find a pulse.

41
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,003
Call the cardiac team.

42
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:38,148
Counting for chest compressions.

43
00:01:38,172 --> 00:01:39,939
One, two, three...

Hey.

49
00:02:16,444 --> 00:02:17,444
Tobias.

50
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:19,408
Gibbs.

51
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,181
You're here.
Thank you. Thank God.

52
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,216
Hey, we came as soon
as we heard.

53
00:02:24,285 --> 00:02:26,218
Where's Emily, huh?

54
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:28,454
Hey, Jack.
With the doctors.

55
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,846
What happened?

56
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,717
She was at some
college party.

57
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:32,502
I guess she collapsed.

58
00:02:32,503 --> 00:02:35,770
They said she was
blue, Gibbs. Blue.

59
00:02:35,838 --> 00:02:38,339
- And what are they saying now?
- They don't know.

60
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,885
It could be anything
between a bee sting

61
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,275
and a pulmonary embolism.

62
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:42,710
Her lungs are fine,

63
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:44,323
but we finished running
her blood, and...

64
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:45,347
She's gonna be okay?

65
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,381
We've stabilized her, yes,

66
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,216
but she is still in
critical condition.

67
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,785
I want to see her.

68
00:02:50,853 --> 00:02:51,853
Of course.

69
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:56,190
- You family?
- Uncle.

70
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,792
Then you should
probably come with.

71
00:02:59,362 --> 00:03:01,162
Okay.

72
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,842
I'm here, baby.

73
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:18,846
I'm here.

74
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,388
Why is she on a ventilator?

75
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,123
She wasn't getting
enough oxygen.

76
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:31,006
I thought you said
it wasn't her lungs.

77
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,560
Correct.

78
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:34,261
We were able to rule out a
pulmonary event rather quickly.

79
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,030
So what is it?

80
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:39,567
Has your daughter undergone
any surgeries recently?

81
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:42,036
FORNELL:
No.

82
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:44,505
Been prescribed any medication
for any pain syndromes?

83
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:45,873
No.

84
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:47,908
You got something to say,
say it.

85
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,612
Your daughter overdosed
on opioids.

86
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:53,114
(stammers)

87
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,395
Where did you get
your medical degree?

88
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:58,853
I know it's a hard
thing to hear,

89
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:00,432
but right now we've
got bigger problems.

90
00:04:00,456 --> 00:04:03,190
Bigger than telling me that
my daughter is a dope addict?

91
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:03,851
Tobias...

92
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,594
I never suggested
she's an addict,

93
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:08,262
but that's a tomorrow
problem. Right now

94
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,197
we have a right-now problem.

95
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:12,233
She's not responding
to naloxone.

96
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:14,635
- It's a drug that we use...
- I know what it is!

97
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:17,938
Something you give
to dope addicts.

98
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,640
She appears to
be allergic.

99
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,186
It's caused a cascade response
in her vascular system.

100
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,078
That's interfering
with her sinus rhythm.

101
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:25,713
What does that mean?

102
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:28,649
We are walking
a very fine line.

103
00:04:28,718 --> 00:04:32,553
Too much antidote, and we could
stop your daughter's heart.

104
00:04:32,622 --> 00:04:36,223
Too little, and she
could asphyxiate.

105
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:38,793
No.

106
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,539
You have to prepare yourself
for the possibility

107
00:04:40,563 --> 00:04:42,730
she won't survive the night.
- No.

108
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:44,476
But rest assured, we are doing
everything in our power to...

109
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,833
Everything in our power?!

110
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:47,668
Hey, hey.

111
00:04:47,737 --> 00:04:49,181
Then why are you
the only one standing here?

112
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,739
Why is my little girl
alone in this room

113
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:53,088
when you've got a whole building

114
00:04:53,142 --> 00:04:54,520
full of brainiacs
with medical degrees?

115
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,456
Mr. Fornell...

116
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,845
And how many more
at home sleeping?

117
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:59,480
So why don't you wake
their sorry asses up

118
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:03,184
and tell them to get in here and
figure this out? Do you hear me?

119
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:05,986
All hands on deck!

120
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,856
So no more standing around.
Get to work.

121
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:10,791
And save my daughter's life!

122
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:22,439
Look, I'm not gonna
press charges.

123
00:05:22,508 --> 00:05:24,207
I appreciate it.

124
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:26,276
I get it.
I really do.

125
00:05:27,846 --> 00:05:29,846
And he looks like
he's calmed down now.

126
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:31,181
It won't happen again.

127
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,883
No, it won't.

128
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:34,951
If he wants
to be let back inside,

129
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,187
he's gonna need
to leave his bazooka at home.

130
00:05:41,694 --> 00:05:43,427
Hey, how's she doing?

131
00:05:43,495 --> 00:05:46,797
- Same. Sloane's with her.
- And Fornell?

132
00:05:46,865 --> 00:05:50,567
Yeah. We should probably
hang on to this for a while.

133
00:05:50,636 --> 00:05:53,236
We stopped by that college
party like you asked.

134
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:54,616
TORRES:
And talked to Emily's friends.

135
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,906
BISHOP:
They said there's no way

136
00:05:55,974 --> 00:05:57,641
she would have taken anything.

137
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,010
They think
maybe her drink was spiked.

138
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,559
Apparently
that's been happening a lot

139
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:03,013
on her campus lately.

140
00:06:03,082 --> 00:06:05,315
So not an overdose.

141
00:06:05,384 --> 00:06:07,651
A crime.

142
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,187
It's not our jurisdiction,
but we alerted Campus P.D.

143
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:11,255
They're all over it.

144
00:06:11,323 --> 00:06:13,557
FORNELL:
I said I want them all.

145
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,036
Is something wrong
with your hearing?

146
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,760
Yeah, I heard you,
but the answer's no.

147
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:18,662
There a problem?

148
00:06:18,731 --> 00:06:21,898
Yeah. I would like
to buy my daughter some flowers,

149
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:24,267
and this jackass
is giving me a hard time.

150
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:26,670
He wants them all.
I told Grumpelstiltskin here

151
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:29,239
he's more than welcome
to purchase up to two.

152
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:30,719
And you are more
than welcome to take those two

153
00:06:30,743 --> 00:06:32,053
and shove them up your...
- Tobias, hey, come on.

154
00:06:32,077 --> 00:06:33,110
- Two.
- Come on.

155
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:34,111
- Sorry.
- Let's go.

156
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:36,246
I'm not really!

157
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:38,248
What kind
of hospital pharmacy

158
00:06:38,317 --> 00:06:40,016
has a limit
on flower arrangements?

159
00:06:40,085 --> 00:06:42,185
It wasn't an overdose.

160
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:45,288
She was drugged.

161
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:49,025
I suppose that should
make me feel better.

162
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:51,061
Except now
I want my gun back.

163
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,929
Campus P.D.-- they're on it.

164
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:55,243
Campus P.D. Wouldn't trust them
to write a jaywalking ticket.

165
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:56,644
Gibbs, I know
you haven't been playing

166
00:06:56,668 --> 00:06:58,034
with a full deck lately,

167
00:06:58,103 --> 00:07:00,203
but you need
to get your ass down to...

168
00:07:00,272 --> 00:07:02,639
And you need to get
your head in the game.

169
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:06,243
Emily needs you, Tobias.
Your daughter needs you.

170
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:08,022
What you need to do is
go upstairs right now

171
00:07:08,046 --> 00:07:09,746
and sit by her bed.

172
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:12,649
And I'm gonna go home and
pick up some clothes for you.

173
00:07:12,718 --> 00:07:14,751
And you're not gonna
yell at anybody,

174
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,753
and you're not
gonna shoot anybody.

175
00:07:16,822 --> 00:07:18,155
Got it?

176
00:07:18,223 --> 00:07:19,589
Got it.

177
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:24,294
Where you going now?

178
00:07:24,363 --> 00:07:25,829
To find some nail polish.

179
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:38,108
(sniffs)

180
00:07:53,058 --> 00:07:55,659
DIANE:
Yeah, that's a great idea.

181
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:58,995
I mean, it's not like Tobias has
a drinking problem or anything.

182
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:02,465
Go ahead and shoot.

183
00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:04,534
See if I care. I'm already dead.

184
00:08:04,603 --> 00:08:06,303
Oh, and thanks for
that, by the way.

185
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:07,871
Ruined my favorite
wool coat.

186
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,875
Got blood all over it. Dick.

187
00:08:11,944 --> 00:08:13,510
This is not happening.

188
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:16,112
(laughing):
Yes. Yeah, it's happening.

189
00:08:16,181 --> 00:08:19,115
The question you really
have to ask yourself is,

190
00:08:19,184 --> 00:08:20,884
what's happening?

191
00:08:20,986 --> 00:08:23,854
Yeah, I'm asking.

192
00:08:23,922 --> 00:08:26,156
Here's a hint. You're talking
to your dead ex-wife.

193
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:27,791
It's usually a red flag.

194
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,126
But the real question is,
what are you doing

195
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:31,895
being a cabana boy

196
00:08:31,964 --> 00:08:33,230
instead of going to find

197
00:08:33,298 --> 00:08:34,698
the punk who dosed
my little girl?

198
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:37,567
What? Excuse me!

199
00:08:37,636 --> 00:08:39,636
Tobias doesn't need
your old boxers.

200
00:08:39,705 --> 00:08:41,905
He needs <i>you</i> on the job.

201
00:08:41,974 --> 00:08:44,875
This case is not even
NCIS jurisdiction.

202
00:08:44,943 --> 00:08:46,710
How did you ever father a child

203
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:48,912
with such a little,
tiny, shriveled....?

204
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:51,514
I am not doing this.
I'm not doing this.

205
00:08:57,322 --> 00:08:58,822
Looks like we might
be doing this.

206
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,230
Why does this stairwell smell
like burnt cheese?

207
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:09,633
What do you want from me?

208
00:09:09,668 --> 00:09:13,436
I want
what my other ex-husband wants.

209
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:16,006
I want you to find the guy
who drugged our daughter.

210
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:19,042
It's not that simple.

211
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:24,080
Oh, you have got to let
this Rule Ten nonsense go.

212
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:26,850
So you're personally
involved in the case.

213
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:30,186
Big deal. You also have
no fashion sense. Life goes on.

214
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:35,125
When you get personally
involved, you make mistakes.

215
00:09:35,193 --> 00:09:37,193
No, that is just
a big fat excuse

216
00:09:37,262 --> 00:09:38,840
for the real problem here,
and you know it.

217
00:09:38,864 --> 00:09:42,432
You are running, Jethro.

218
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:44,534
You're running scared.

219
00:09:44,603 --> 00:09:47,570
So you need to ask yourself--
are you a man or a mouse?

220
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:50,941
'Cause if you're a man,
get your head in the game!

221
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:57,080
I want Emily Fornell's case.

222
00:09:57,149 --> 00:09:58,748
Took you long enough.

223
00:09:58,817 --> 00:10:00,383
I already wasted
too much time.

224
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:02,218
All right, well,
I'll skip my prepared speech

225
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:04,054
and go right
to the highlight reel. No.

226
00:10:04,122 --> 00:10:06,456
Leon, whoever drugged her
is still out there.

227
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:07,958
They did it before.

228
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:09,426
They are gonna do it again.

229
00:10:09,494 --> 00:10:11,494
Almost a dozen
cases last month.

230
00:10:11,563 --> 00:10:13,163
Next time could be a lot worse.

231
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:16,967
As much as I would love
to unleash you on the bastard

232
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:19,402
that did this to Emily,
I cannot sanction it.

233
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:21,191
- Come on!
- Gibbs, your personal connection

234
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:24,407
to this case is bad enough, and
with the lack of jurisdiction,

235
00:10:24,476 --> 00:10:27,911
that's a good way to get us
all fired and probably worse.

236
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,347
Duck!

237
00:10:30,415 --> 00:10:32,015
Jurisdiction--
or in Latin,

238
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:34,584
<i>iuris dicende causa--</i>

239
00:10:34,653 --> 00:10:36,619
the administration of justice.

240
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:39,089
It came into use
in the latter part

241
00:10:39,157 --> 00:10:40,635
of the 14th century...
- Skip ahead, Duck.

242
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:42,092
Ah, right.

243
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,294
Last year
the owner of the property

244
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:46,930
where the alleged criminal act
occurred

245
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:48,431
hired a contractor

246
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,667
to add a second story.
Unfortunately,

247
00:10:50,736 --> 00:10:54,337
the contractor sued the
property owner for fraud.

248
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:57,140
That case is
now in court.

249
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:58,541
Mm-hmm.

250
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,677
Last month, however,

251
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:04,280
this same contractor
was hired,

252
00:11:04,349 --> 00:11:05,548
but this time

253
00:11:05,617 --> 00:11:07,951
on a Navy off-base house.

254
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,519
I see.

255
00:11:09,588 --> 00:11:10,887
So, now...

256
00:11:10,956 --> 00:11:14,457
this Navy contractor

257
00:11:14,526 --> 00:11:16,026
is in a legal dispute...

258
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:19,129
Stop. You had me
at <i>iuris dicende causa.</i>

259
00:11:19,197 --> 00:11:20,296
Yes,

260
00:11:20,365 --> 00:11:21,531
it's within
our purview

261
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,632
to investigate

262
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:24,034
when one of our contractors

263
00:11:24,102 --> 00:11:25,342
is involved
in a criminal probe.

264
00:11:26,138 --> 00:11:27,904
However tangential.

265
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:30,974
We good to go?

266
00:11:31,043 --> 00:11:32,842
Torres, talk
to any other victims.

267
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:34,811
Bishop, McGee,

268
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,313
interview everyone
who was at the party.

269
00:11:37,382 --> 00:11:39,682
(phone rings)

270
00:11:42,654 --> 00:11:44,854
See if there's
any cell phone footage.

271
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:46,856
Chapsnats. Whatever.

272
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:48,124
On it.

273
00:11:48,193 --> 00:11:50,860
Tell Sloane to work up
a profile on our suspect.

274
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:52,495
Is everything okay?

275
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:54,427
What do you think
that was about?

276
00:11:54,451 --> 00:11:55,433
I...

277
00:11:55,434 --> 00:11:58,134
Maybe he got
a Chapsnat.

278
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:05,275
(laughing):
I'm not kidding, Dad.

279
00:12:05,343 --> 00:12:07,277
I hate flowers.
You never got the memo?

280
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:08,623
What kind of
self-respecting girl

281
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:09,913
does not like flowers?

282
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:11,247
That's sexist,

283
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:12,615
twice over.

284
00:12:13,752 --> 00:12:15,218
Hi, Uncle Gibbs.

285
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:16,686
Hi, Em.

286
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:18,388
Feeling better?

287
00:12:18,457 --> 00:12:20,356
Fine, actually.

288
00:12:20,425 --> 00:12:22,559
One minute she looks
like death warmed over...

289
00:12:22,627 --> 00:12:24,294
- Hey!
- and the next she is critiquing

290
00:12:24,362 --> 00:12:26,463
my interior decorating skills.

291
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:29,699
EMILY: The doctor said they found the
sweet spot with the naloxone.

292
00:12:29,768 --> 00:12:32,235
I just... can't believe
this happened to me.

293
00:12:32,304 --> 00:12:34,871
- Forget about that.
- I'm so careful, too.

294
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,706
Do you know who did it?
No.

295
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:38,575
Not yet. But we're going to.

296
00:12:38,643 --> 00:12:39,976
Torres is on it.

297
00:12:40,045 --> 00:12:41,744
We can forget
about that, too.

298
00:12:41,813 --> 00:12:44,247
You're gonna be okay.

299
00:12:44,316 --> 00:12:45,582
That's what's important.

300
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,716
Uh, when you going home?

301
00:12:46,785 --> 00:12:48,751
One more test
and she's all yours.

302
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,919
Nurse?

303
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:51,588
EMILY (chuckles):
I can walk.

304
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,425
What happened to my toes?

305
00:12:55,494 --> 00:12:56,993
GIBBS:
Looks like

306
00:12:57,062 --> 00:12:58,895
your father happened.

307
00:12:58,964 --> 00:13:00,630
I was just returning
the favor.

308
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:02,799
You touch my feet again,
and I'm filing

309
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:05,135
a restraining order.
(chuckles)

310
00:13:13,245 --> 00:13:15,612
What was with the 911?

311
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,080
So, Vance gave you
jurisdiction?

312
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:20,283
Well, yeah, but it sounded
like you don't want our help.

313
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:22,185
Oh, I want.

314
00:13:29,361 --> 00:13:32,962
This-- This opioid thing.
Always made me crazy,

315
00:13:33,031 --> 00:13:34,430
but now it's personal.

316
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:35,499
Right there with you.

317
00:13:35,534 --> 00:13:37,767
Some punk drugged
my little girl.

318
00:13:37,836 --> 00:13:40,503
Some dealer sold that punk
the drugs.

319
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:42,438
Promise me
that we will get them.

320
00:13:42,507 --> 00:13:43,651
Every single
last one of them.

321
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:44,685
Yeah, right there with you.

322
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:46,376
The chemist who made
the drugs, his mom,

323
00:13:46,444 --> 00:13:49,112
her dog walker, and screw
probable cause and warrants.

324
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:50,258
We're gonna find them
wherever they are,

325
00:13:50,282 --> 00:13:51,726
and we're gonna put a bullet
in their heads.

326
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,484
I know this is just the fight
you've been itching for.

327
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:58,321
Promise me. Promise me
we're gonna get them all.

328
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:07,470
So you didn't actually
see the guy

329
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:08,471
who spiked Emily's drink?

330
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:10,439
I didn't see him
do it, no,

331
00:14:10,508 --> 00:14:12,141
but Olivia and Hannah
said they did.

332
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,278
ALEXIS: Uh, tall guy. Was lurking
around her all night.

333
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:16,646
Had a nose ring.

334
00:14:16,714 --> 00:14:17,714
Do you have a name?

335
00:14:17,782 --> 00:14:19,815
No, but, Spencer,
you talked to him?

336
00:14:19,884 --> 00:14:21,284
Just for a second.

337
00:14:21,352 --> 00:14:23,185
ALEXIS: Can't believe
this happened to Emily.

338
00:14:23,254 --> 00:14:25,521
She doesn't drink,
doesn't smoke.

339
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,123
Is she gonna be okay?

340
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:29,458
Yes. She's already home
from the hospital.

341
00:14:29,527 --> 00:14:31,727
McGEE: But this could've been
a whole lot worse.

342
00:14:31,796 --> 00:14:33,663
Is there anything else
you guys can think of?

343
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:36,666
No.
Um...

344
00:14:36,734 --> 00:14:38,301
nope.

345
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:41,382
Care to try that answer again?

346
00:14:41,406 --> 00:14:42,605
I found

347
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:43,839
this...

348
00:14:43,908 --> 00:14:45,975
by the bar when we were
cleaning up this morning.

349
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:51,080
Is there a reason
you didn't mention this sooner?

350
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:53,182
Because it could be anybody's.

351
00:14:53,251 --> 00:14:54,417
And we didn't want to get

352
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:56,185
the wrong person in trouble.

353
00:14:56,254 --> 00:14:57,920
- But...
- But...

354
00:14:57,989 --> 00:14:59,522
it's possible the person

355
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,891
who spiked Emily's drink
dropped this.

356
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:03,659
And we definitely
want to get <i>him</i>

357
00:15:03,728 --> 00:15:04,894
in trouble.

358
00:15:04,962 --> 00:15:06,696
Well, if this is
what I think it is,

359
00:15:06,764 --> 00:15:08,831
someone's definitely
getting in trouble.

360
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,666
Starting with you two,
if I find out

361
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:13,169
you're withholding
any other evidence.

362
00:15:13,237 --> 00:15:15,104
Seven of the victims
on her campus

363
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:16,906
were able to give us
descriptions of the guy

364
00:15:17,008 --> 00:15:17,907
they think
drugged them.

365
00:15:17,975 --> 00:15:19,575
- How many had nose rings?
- One.

366
00:15:19,644 --> 00:15:20,406
That's our guy.

367
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,945
Yeah, now all we got to do
is just find him.

368
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:23,879
And I can help
with that.

369
00:15:23,948 --> 00:15:25,047
I analyzed the pill

370
00:15:25,116 --> 00:15:27,083
Emily's friend found
at the party.

371
00:15:27,151 --> 00:15:29,418
It has the exact same
chemical composition

372
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:31,087
as the opioid
she was drugged with.

373
00:15:31,155 --> 00:15:32,383
Our guy must've dropped it.

374
00:15:32,407 --> 00:15:33,957
Any DNA?

375
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,502
Uh, nothing usable.
But... through the magic

376
00:15:35,526 --> 00:15:37,526
of chemical science,
I still

377
00:15:37,595 --> 00:15:40,930
have a lead. The pill
is not pharmaceutical grade.

378
00:15:40,998 --> 00:15:42,631
Take a look at
the optical isomers...

379
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,733
No.

380
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:45,134
Yeah, we're not gonna do that.

381
00:15:45,203 --> 00:15:47,370
Oh, right, I forgot.
You're both Level IIs.

382
00:15:47,438 --> 00:15:49,872
Bottom line, this
is a bootleg drug.

383
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:51,073
And if we can figure out

384
00:15:51,142 --> 00:15:53,209
where this drink-spiking jerk
got it...

385
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:54,610
It might lead
back to him.

386
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,611
Kase,

387
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,946
good work.

388
00:15:57,014 --> 00:15:59,749
Torres, BOLO on the pill.

389
00:15:59,817 --> 00:16:02,084
See if it shows up
in any other drug busts.

390
00:16:02,153 --> 00:16:04,954
And don't mention
any of this to Fornell.

391
00:16:05,022 --> 00:16:06,222
Copy that.

392
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,490
Fornell?

393
00:16:07,558 --> 00:16:09,058
Level II?

394
00:16:09,127 --> 00:16:11,727
(typing)

395
00:16:11,796 --> 00:16:13,262
"Fifth-grade

396
00:16:13,331 --> 00:16:14,764
science or lower"?

397
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,600
Okay, I'll take that.

398
00:16:17,668 --> 00:16:19,902
Why can't we mention
this to Fornell?

399
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:21,570
Well, what would your dad do
to some guy

400
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,738
who tried to drug you?

401
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:25,174
Probably the same thing
that <i>you'd</i> do

402
00:16:25,243 --> 00:16:27,243
if someone tried
to do that to Bishop.

403
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:30,814
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

404
00:16:33,351 --> 00:16:35,017
Here. You're late.

405
00:16:35,086 --> 00:16:36,919
Meatloaf is
getting cold.

406
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:38,354
It wasn't much better warm.

407
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:40,263
You're more than welcome
to cook our next meal.

408
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:42,992
Here.

409
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,493
Have a date rape straw.

410
00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:45,828
It can detect five

411
00:16:45,897 --> 00:16:49,265
common sedatives. A gift
from my helicopter parent.

412
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,863
Sounds like
a <i>smart</i> parent.

413
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,236
Well, can you please

414
00:16:53,237 --> 00:16:55,137
tell him that I'm fine?
It happened,

415
00:16:55,206 --> 00:16:57,106
it's over. I would like
to put this behind me.

416
00:16:57,175 --> 00:16:58,641
He is right here.

417
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:01,010
And the best defense
is a good offense.

418
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:04,146
Says the man who put
a five-pound dongle

419
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:05,648
on my key chain.
- Yeah.

420
00:17:05,716 --> 00:17:07,817
Pepper spray.
It'll stop a bear.

421
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:11,320
Ooh. Almost forgot.
(sighs)

422
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:12,955
Help.

423
00:17:13,024 --> 00:17:15,157
DIANE:
For once I'm with Tobias.

424
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:16,392
Back him up.

425
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:17,993
Back him up,
or I'm gonna

426
00:17:18,095 --> 00:17:19,462
set up shop
in your bathroom.

427
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,033
Bears can be dangerous.

428
00:17:24,101 --> 00:17:25,167
Good boy.

429
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:26,869
FORNELL:
Like it?

430
00:17:26,938 --> 00:17:28,137
It's a blinding
flashlight.

431
00:17:28,206 --> 00:17:29,271
1,000 lumens.

432
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,673
It'll stop a bear, too.

433
00:17:30,741 --> 00:17:32,675
That's it.
I'm leaving.

434
00:17:32,743 --> 00:17:34,021
I have a student newspaper
meeting in an hour.

435
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:35,244
I'll walk you
to the car.

436
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:36,545
I'll go with.

437
00:17:36,614 --> 00:17:39,315
Nobody's coming with.
I can walk myself to my car.

438
00:17:39,383 --> 00:17:41,550
And any bear that gets
in my way is a dead man.

439
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:45,521
(sighs)

440
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,189
It was a hell of a lot easier

441
00:17:47,258 --> 00:17:50,426
when I could solve all
of her problems by just

442
00:17:50,495 --> 00:17:53,329
taking her in my arms and
singing "Hush, Little Baby."

443
00:17:53,397 --> 00:17:56,532
Ooh! She forgot
the stun gun.

444
00:18:03,307 --> 00:18:05,007
Well?

445
00:18:05,076 --> 00:18:06,775
Nope.

446
00:18:07,678 --> 00:18:09,545
No?

447
00:18:09,614 --> 00:18:12,414
So you're just gonna
ignore me now?

448
00:18:12,483 --> 00:18:14,550
Pedro Hernandez.

449
00:18:16,954 --> 00:18:18,787
You never answered
Tobias's question.

450
00:18:18,856 --> 00:18:21,790
Are you gonna
get them?

451
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:24,026
- Get who?
- Don't play dumb.

452
00:18:24,095 --> 00:18:25,761
The punk who drugged
my little girl.

453
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,274
The dealer who gave
the punk the drugs.

454
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:29,698
- My team's working on it.
- Your team?

455
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:31,100
Mm-hmm.

456
00:18:31,168 --> 00:18:33,235
Yeah, your team has
to follow the rules.

457
00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:35,516
Sometimes the bad guy gets away
when you follow the rules.

458
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,972
He hasn't gotten away yet.

459
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:40,442
If it comes to it,
are you going to do for <i>my</i> baby

460
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,944
what you did for yours?

461
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:43,245
What do you want from me?

462
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:45,047
I want to know
who you are!

463
00:18:45,116 --> 00:18:47,116
I don't know who I am!

464
00:18:50,454 --> 00:18:52,388
Who are you
talking to?

465
00:18:54,225 --> 00:18:55,824
Nobody.

466
00:18:55,893 --> 00:18:57,626
Yes, you were.

467
00:18:57,695 --> 00:19:00,462
And you had...

468
00:19:00,531 --> 00:19:02,064
I don't know.

469
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:05,634
Your tone.
It was familiar.

470
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:09,905
It was the Diane tone.

471
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:15,177
Were you having a conversation
with our dead ex-wife?

472
00:19:15,246 --> 00:19:16,096
No.

473
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,681
Look, it's
perfectly normal.

474
00:19:17,682 --> 00:19:20,449
People talk
to deceased family members

475
00:19:20,518 --> 00:19:22,585
all the time.

476
00:19:22,653 --> 00:19:25,020
You can be honest about it.

477
00:19:25,089 --> 00:19:27,823
Is that
what you were doing?

478
00:19:27,892 --> 00:19:30,159
Yeah, maybe.

479
00:19:30,227 --> 00:19:32,595
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

480
00:19:34,699 --> 00:19:36,231
You-- you're really going crazy.

481
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,700
(phone ringing)
Going totally crazy.

482
00:19:37,735 --> 00:19:40,021
And you've got
Diane stuck in your head.

483
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:42,045
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

484
00:19:42,073 --> 00:19:44,440
No. No, that's Fornell.
(laughing continues)

485
00:19:44,508 --> 00:19:47,476
He's fine.
Where?

486
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:48,677
All right. Be there.

487
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:50,813
I'm fine.
You're not fine.

488
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:52,681
GIBBS:
<i>Where is he?</i>

489
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,351
Over here.
Police found him passed out.

490
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:56,619
Looks like a drug overdose.

491
00:19:56,687 --> 00:19:58,654
Paramedics revived him
with naloxone.

492
00:19:58,723 --> 00:20:00,122
They found these
in his pocket.

493
00:20:00,191 --> 00:20:03,826
Same triangle mark as the pill
Emily was drugged with.

494
00:20:06,063 --> 00:20:07,496
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

495
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:09,164
Need to ask
a few questions.

496
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:10,566
Can you take
the cuffs off him?

497
00:20:10,635 --> 00:20:13,002
No, this guy's
going to jail.

498
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,269
What's the charge?

499
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,572
Possession of a narcotic
without a prescription.

500
00:20:16,641 --> 00:20:18,140
Was he dealing?

501
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:19,209
No.

502
00:20:19,243 --> 00:20:20,376
Cuffs stay on.

503
00:20:20,444 --> 00:20:23,712
You got two minutes.

504
00:20:25,316 --> 00:20:27,082
What'd you want to ask me?

505
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:29,685
You got a family?

506
00:20:29,754 --> 00:20:31,820
I did.

507
00:20:31,889 --> 00:20:37,226
My wife didn't want the kids
to see me like this, so...

508
00:20:37,294 --> 00:20:39,561
I'm trying to get clean.

509
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,064
I am. It's just...

510
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:44,099
When you're ready...

511
00:20:44,168 --> 00:20:47,069
call me.

512
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,906
So, what'd you really
want to ask me?

513
00:20:50,975 --> 00:20:53,509
Where'd you get these?

514
00:20:53,577 --> 00:20:56,011
The guy's name
is Professor Ralphie.

515
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,081
That's what everyone
calls him, anyway.

516
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,717
Lives by the campus.
Sells to all the kids.

517
00:21:01,786 --> 00:21:03,419
You got an address?

518
00:21:03,454 --> 00:21:05,454
I'll even draw you a map.

519
00:21:05,523 --> 00:21:06,855
(hip hop playing inside)

520
00:21:06,924 --> 00:21:09,258
NCIS. Open up.

521
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:10,959
He was a
pharmaceutical rep.

522
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:14,263
Lost his job for
skimming meds.

523
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:19,735
(sighing):
Oh, for Pete's sake.

524
00:21:19,804 --> 00:21:21,603
Are you waiting
for an invitation?

525
00:21:21,672 --> 00:21:24,940
Kick it in.
Maybe this'll help.

526
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:28,377
♪ When I stepped in the game,
all of you knew my name ♪

527
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:30,424
♪ When I leave, I'll be good
long as I got same... ♪

528
00:21:30,448 --> 00:21:32,047
Gibbs...

529
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:33,248
GIBBS:
Nose ring.

530
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:36,151
It's our guy.
I'll check the back.

531
00:21:43,294 --> 00:21:44,493
Gibbs?

532
00:21:53,037 --> 00:21:55,404
Hi, Uncle Gibbs.

533
00:22:03,861 --> 00:22:05,827
EMILY: If I had known Ralphie
was in trouble,

534
00:22:05,896 --> 00:22:07,596
I would've called 911.

535
00:22:07,665 --> 00:22:09,698
The foam cone around
his nose suggests anoxia

536
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:11,133
following
pulmonary edema.

537
00:22:11,202 --> 00:22:13,168
In layman's terms, that is...

538
00:22:13,237 --> 00:22:14,603
Heroin overdose.

539
00:22:14,672 --> 00:22:16,605
I don't get it.

540
00:22:16,674 --> 00:22:18,640
He told me
he doesn't touch the stuff.

541
00:22:18,709 --> 00:22:22,211
Needle in his arm
suggests otherwise.

542
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,046
Dust for prints.

543
00:22:24,114 --> 00:22:26,081
What are you gonna tell my dad?

544
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,817
Question is,
what are <i>you</i> gonna tell him?

545
00:22:28,886 --> 00:22:30,385
It's not what you think.

546
00:22:30,454 --> 00:22:32,214
I just came by to pick up
a little something,

547
00:22:32,256 --> 00:22:33,622
and Ralphie invited me

548
00:22:33,691 --> 00:22:37,292
to party,
so I stayed.

549
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:41,230
So he didn't spike your drink
the other night, did he?

550
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,666
Is he your boyfriend?

551
00:22:44,735 --> 00:22:45,901
No.

552
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,703
He's your dealer.

553
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:49,504
FORNELL:
Your what?

554
00:22:49,573 --> 00:22:51,707
Your dealer?

555
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:54,209
- My daughter has a dealer?
- Dad, calm down.

556
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:55,644
Oh, Dad is not calming down.

557
00:22:55,713 --> 00:22:57,246
Then back off.
He's just a friend.

558
00:22:57,314 --> 00:22:59,014
Everything is under control.

559
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:01,383
Really? Almost dying
in the ER one day

560
00:23:01,452 --> 00:23:03,485
and getting high
with a corpse the next

561
00:23:03,554 --> 00:23:05,320
is your idea of "under control"?

562
00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:07,089
What does out of control
look like?

563
00:23:07,157 --> 00:23:09,258
You need help, Emily.

564
00:23:09,326 --> 00:23:11,260
My life is none
of your business.

565
00:23:11,328 --> 00:23:12,661
None of my what?

566
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:18,267
I am the only parent
that you have left,

567
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:20,602
in case you didn't notice.
- How dare you?

568
00:23:20,671 --> 00:23:22,271
(exhales)

569
00:23:24,008 --> 00:23:25,207
You get back here.

570
00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:26,908
Boss, we got a problem.

571
00:23:26,977 --> 00:23:28,677
You think?

572
00:23:28,746 --> 00:23:30,379
No, the syringe.

573
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:32,514
There's no prints on it.
It's been wiped clean.

574
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:33,593
JIMMY:
Yeah, and check this out.

575
00:23:33,617 --> 00:23:35,117
I found a secondary
injection point.

576
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:38,020
Looks like he was jabbed
from behind. Gibbs,

577
00:23:38,088 --> 00:23:40,689
I think this crime scene
was staged.

578
00:23:40,758 --> 00:23:42,691
This wasn't
an accidental overdose.

579
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,526
- It was a murder.
SPENCER: A what?

580
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:47,629
What are you doing here?

581
00:23:47,698 --> 00:23:49,197
I live here.

582
00:23:49,266 --> 00:23:52,367
You live with an opioid dealer
who's got a nose ring?

583
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:54,970
That slip your mind
when we talked this morning?

584
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,919
SPENCER: Do these handcuffs
have to be so tight?

585
00:23:56,974 --> 00:23:58,206
Yes.

586
00:23:58,275 --> 00:24:00,409
This is all a big
misunderstanding.

587
00:24:00,477 --> 00:24:03,545
Great. Can't wait
to hear all about it.

588
00:24:03,614 --> 00:24:05,147
DIANE:
Me, too.

589
00:24:07,785 --> 00:24:09,195
(whispering):
You got to be kidding me.

590
00:24:09,219 --> 00:24:10,619
Sorry, what's that, boss?

591
00:24:11,722 --> 00:24:14,156
You got to be kidding me

592
00:24:14,224 --> 00:24:16,825
that this is all
a big misunderstanding.

593
00:24:16,894 --> 00:24:18,827
Yeah, that's real smooth,
Woodchuck.

594
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:21,263
Excuse me, boss.

595
00:24:21,332 --> 00:24:23,999
Nice watch, McGee.

596
00:24:24,068 --> 00:24:25,801
Thanks. Let's go.

597
00:24:27,371 --> 00:24:29,237
- You coming?
- No.

598
00:24:29,306 --> 00:24:32,441
I am most definitely not coming.

599
00:24:37,748 --> 00:24:39,681
All right.

600
00:24:41,185 --> 00:24:43,118
- What now?
- What now?

601
00:24:43,187 --> 00:24:45,921
You mean, besides
my daughter being a drug addict?

602
00:24:47,524 --> 00:24:48,790
And I blame you.

603
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:50,959
Me?!

604
00:24:51,028 --> 00:24:52,794
You're a piece of work, Diane!

605
00:24:52,863 --> 00:24:55,130
When I was killed, Tobias
needed you more than anything,

606
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,531
and where were you?

607
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,977
I was right here.
Yeah, "right here,"

608
00:24:58,001 --> 00:24:59,935
getting him fired from the FBI.

609
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:03,805
He was a single father
trying to raise a teenage girl

610
00:25:03,874 --> 00:25:06,641
all by himself,
struggling with alcoholism,

611
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,988
and you take away the one thing
that was keeping him stable?

612
00:25:09,012 --> 00:25:11,680
- And now look what happened.
- I know what happened.

613
00:25:11,749 --> 00:25:13,048
Y-You don't think that I know?

614
00:25:13,117 --> 00:25:15,217
- Oh, blah, blah, blah.
- Not a day goes by

615
00:25:15,285 --> 00:25:16,863
that I don't think about what happened.
Yada, yada, yada, tell it

616
00:25:16,887 --> 00:25:18,787
to the judge.

617
00:25:18,856 --> 00:25:20,389
(sighs)

618
00:25:21,525 --> 00:25:24,159
What are we doing here?

619
00:25:24,228 --> 00:25:25,988
You still haven't answered
Tobias's question.

620
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:27,963
And now you haven't
answered mine.

621
00:25:28,031 --> 00:25:29,831
- Which is what?
- Somebody got

622
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,833
my baby hooked on drugs.

623
00:25:31,902 --> 00:25:34,035
And now she's wrapped up
in a murder?

624
00:25:34,104 --> 00:25:35,871
You got a question
in there somewhere?

625
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:39,708
Yeah. If your badge
can't get this guy,

626
00:25:39,777 --> 00:25:42,711
are you gonna get him anyway?

627
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,550
This is all your fault.

628
00:25:50,721 --> 00:25:52,654
You owe Tobias.

629
00:25:53,924 --> 00:25:55,857
You owe all of us.

630
00:26:00,431 --> 00:26:01,830
Hey.

631
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:03,910
(chuckles): I heard about your
famous elevator talks, and,

632
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:08,403
and I was walking by,
a-and I thought I heard...

633
00:26:09,573 --> 00:26:13,041
Yeah, but you're alone,
so, uh...

634
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,321
You know what? I'm just gonna
stand here with my eyes closed

635
00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:16,511
until you walk away.

636
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:22,784
Where you been?

637
00:26:22,853 --> 00:26:24,419
Impounding Ralphie's
car. Where's Emily?

638
00:26:24,488 --> 00:26:26,054
I don't know,
she won't talk to me.

639
00:26:26,123 --> 00:26:27,456
But I need to find out

640
00:26:27,524 --> 00:26:29,691
where this started,
who gave her that first pill.

641
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,294
You don't go
straight to dealers.

642
00:26:32,362 --> 00:26:34,362
So I figured I'd come
where the action was.

643
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:36,097
Yeah.

644
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,640
Okay, what do we know
on the victim?/

645
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:39,201
Um...
(clears throat)

646
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:41,770
Before Professor Ralphie
was a pharmaceutical rep,

647
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,940
he was a student
at Emily's college.

648
00:26:45,008 --> 00:26:47,576
Pharmacy school, which
he flunked out of.

649
00:26:47,644 --> 00:26:48,944
Winning.

650
00:26:49,012 --> 00:26:50,812
BISHOP: Other than a few
jaywalking tickets,

651
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:53,582
he's managed to stay
under the radar.

652
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,884
TORRES: Not much in
his credit card statements.

653
00:26:55,953 --> 00:26:58,286
Then again, dealers
are mostly cash.

654
00:26:58,355 --> 00:27:00,288
Actually, I...

655
00:27:01,525 --> 00:27:03,458
What?

656
00:27:03,527 --> 00:27:05,460
Actually, I should go.

657
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:08,730
Try to talk to Emily again.
Maybe she knows something.

658
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:12,300
Okay, who killed him?

659
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:13,635
Rival dealer?

660
00:27:13,704 --> 00:27:15,804
Maybe a drug buy gone bad?

661
00:27:15,873 --> 00:27:18,807
Oh, my gut says, if we want
to find Ralphie's killer,

662
00:27:18,876 --> 00:27:21,409
we find out where he was
getting his supply.

663
00:27:21,478 --> 00:27:23,345
What do you want from me?

664
00:27:23,413 --> 00:27:26,848
We want to know where Ralphie
was getting his supply.

665
00:27:26,917 --> 00:27:29,117
I don't know.

666
00:27:29,186 --> 00:27:31,786
I put an ad on the school
website for a roommate.

667
00:27:31,855 --> 00:27:34,689
Ralphie answered.
I, I hardly know the guy.

668
00:27:34,758 --> 00:27:36,491
Please don't play dumb.

669
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,860
It's so unattractive.

670
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:42,197
I'm not playing, okay?
I'm an art major.

671
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:44,199
My brother was the smart one.

672
00:27:44,268 --> 00:27:46,312
Well, then, maybe you should
call him up and have him explain

673
00:27:46,336 --> 00:27:48,703
to you obstruction of justice.

674
00:27:48,772 --> 00:27:50,972
Wh-What did I obstruct?

675
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:53,975
Well, for starters, you told me
that Olivia and Hannah

676
00:27:54,044 --> 00:27:56,311
saw someone spike Emily's drink.

677
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,690
McGEE: Except we spoke
to both of them,

678
00:27:57,714 --> 00:27:59,314
and they never said that.

679
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:02,684
Maybe I heard wrong.

680
00:28:02,753 --> 00:28:05,520
Or maybe you knew that
Emily had a drug problem.

681
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:07,722
And you were covering up
for her because you knew

682
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:09,524
that it would lead
back to you.

683
00:28:09,593 --> 00:28:12,360
(laughs): O-Okay,
you guys are way off base.

684
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:14,362
Sure, I knew Emily was using,

685
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:16,064
but I didn't know
how bad it had gotten.

686
00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:18,633
I would have never introduced
her to Ralphie if I'd known.

687
00:28:18,702 --> 00:28:20,569
Okay, your
"get out of obstruction" card

688
00:28:20,637 --> 00:28:22,003
is about to expire.

689
00:28:22,072 --> 00:28:24,973
Where does your roommate
get his supply?

690
00:28:27,077 --> 00:28:28,810
Going once...

691
00:28:30,213 --> 00:28:32,681
...going twice.
- Whoa-- hey, hey.

692
00:28:32,749 --> 00:28:36,384
He got his supply
from some pill-happy doctor

693
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:38,186
that Emily
had introduced him to.

694
00:28:38,255 --> 00:28:39,654
Do you have a name?

695
00:28:39,723 --> 00:28:40,889
No.

696
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:42,591
I-I swear.

697
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:45,393
But... his office
was in Littleton.

698
00:28:45,462 --> 00:28:47,596
He was a podiatrist, I think?

699
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,002
Hey, hello there.
I'm Dr. Berman.

700
00:28:54,071 --> 00:28:55,837
- Tobias Fornell.
- Yeah.

701
00:28:55,906 --> 00:28:57,772
So, uh, my nurse tells
me that you're suffering

702
00:28:57,841 --> 00:28:59,708
from a little, uh, hammertoe?

703
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,343
Been a problem for years.

704
00:29:01,411 --> 00:29:03,371
Oh, okay, well, let's take
a look at it, shall we?

705
00:29:04,748 --> 00:29:06,181
By any chance,

706
00:29:06,249 --> 00:29:09,517
does my last name
sound familiar to you? Fornell?

707
00:29:09,586 --> 00:29:13,455
No, but, uh, my nurse tells me
that you're a new patient.

708
00:29:13,523 --> 00:29:16,091
I am, but my daughter
used to come here.

709
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,461
I dropped her off a few times.
Her name's Emily.

710
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:21,396
Doesn't ring a bell.

711
00:29:21,465 --> 00:29:23,865
Your foot is perfectly normal,
Mr. Fornell.

712
00:29:23,934 --> 00:29:25,467
(laughs)

713
00:29:25,535 --> 00:29:29,771
Oh, there is absolutely nothing
normal about me, trust me.

714
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,873
(both chuckle)
I'm here

715
00:29:31,942 --> 00:29:36,711
because I saw your name
on a credit card statement

716
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,947
belonging to a drug dealer.

717
00:29:39,016 --> 00:29:43,084
(laughs): I'm not sure
I'm following. Uh...

718
00:29:43,153 --> 00:29:46,121
A drug dealer...

719
00:29:47,824 --> 00:29:50,558
...who's been selling drugs
to my daughter.

720
00:29:50,627 --> 00:29:52,560
It's funny,
isn't it,

721
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:58,066
that both she and he should go
to the same pill-happy doctor.

722
00:29:58,135 --> 00:30:01,403
It's what we call in the biz
a coincidence.

723
00:30:01,471 --> 00:30:04,272
Except maybe it's not.

724
00:30:04,341 --> 00:30:06,074
You following?

725
00:30:06,143 --> 00:30:08,343
No.

726
00:30:08,412 --> 00:30:09,778
You'll have to excuse me.

727
00:30:09,846 --> 00:30:11,780
Oh, I will not.

728
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:15,316
I will not excuse you.

729
00:30:20,223 --> 00:30:23,158
I will never excuse you.

730
00:30:29,322 --> 00:30:32,397
Well, no, so I'm confused.
Did you find the doctor or not?

731
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:33,731
Well, it wasn't that hard.

732
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,733
There was one podiatrist
in Littleton,

733
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,501
but there was a small problem.

734
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,737
What?

735
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:41,739
Uh, Fornell beat us to him.

736
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,640
He must have seen
something in the squad room

737
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:44,942
that tipped him off.

738
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,910
How bad?

739
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:49,124
We got there just in time,
but Fornell was getting ready

740
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:50,481
to waterboard the guy.

741
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:51,860
The doc said he's not gonna
press charges...

742
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:54,118
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know the drill.

743
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,120
BERMAN:
<i>I have done nothing wrong.</i>

744
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,789
Your daughter came to me and she
was in pain, so I treated her.

745
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:01,125
She had a bone spur, you
prescribed her opioids?

746
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,761
- Oh, thank God.
- What do you do for a hangnail, morphine?

747
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,640
Fornell asked me to review
his daughter's medical records.

748
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:06,675
I think I made things worse.

749
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,210
- Tobias.
- Have you ever heard of aspirin?

750
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:10,534
Tobias, calm down.
Everybody else, sit down.

751
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:12,870
Special Agent Gibbs. I only have
one question for you.

752
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:16,373
You know that guy?

753
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,209
Sit down.

754
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:20,345
Do you know that guy?

755
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:21,590
Look, your agents have already

756
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:22,724
told me about your concerns,

757
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,281
but I can assure you,
I have

758
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,984
never prescribed anyone
enough opioids for them

759
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,852
to start dealing,
much less this guy.

760
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:30,888
You got my little girl
hooked on drugs.

761
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:32,400
- I saw him once.
JIMMY: Okay, all right.

762
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:34,124
It says here
you were Luna Bay Labs'

763
00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:35,626
top prescriber in the district?

764
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:38,028
Got a free trip to Cancun.

765
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:39,841
Her friends said that
she'd never touched the stuff

766
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:41,799
until you prescribed
it. And for what?

767
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:43,167
To work on your tan?

768
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,003
Everything I've done

769
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,672
is perfectly legal,
so if your drug dealers

770
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:51,708
are selling drugs, they're
getting it from someplace else.

771
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:54,077
And-- yeah, and you are free
to audit my records

772
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,013
if you don't believe me.

773
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:09,827
(knocking on door)

774
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,731
Hey.

775
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,567
You done auditing
those records?

776
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:17,935
What's taking you so long?

777
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:20,070
Working on it.

778
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:23,006
Thought you and Emily were
seeing Dr. Grace tonight.

779
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:24,208
She won't go.

780
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,776
Found out today

781
00:32:25,845 --> 00:32:27,611
she hasn't been
to class in weeks.

782
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,214
Her school doesn't even have
a student newspaper.

783
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,516
Gibbs, how did I miss this?

784
00:32:32,585 --> 00:32:34,918
How did I totally
and completely miss this?

785
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:35,919
Everybody did.

786
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:37,454
The harder
I try to help her,

787
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,857
the more I'm driving her away.

788
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:43,527
I am over my head.

789
00:32:43,596 --> 00:32:46,129
I don't know what to do.
I need...

790
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,600
I need her mother.

791
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,919
What are the chances
you're really talking to...?

792
00:32:57,943 --> 00:32:59,977
No. No way.

793
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:02,646
- Just ask her what I should do.
- No.

794
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:03,915
Tobias, it's not gonna happen.

795
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:06,650
And tell me what she says.
Easy peasy.

796
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:08,886
Tobias, look,

797
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:12,089
I'm not really talking
to Diane. I just...

798
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,625
You're losing your mind?
Fine, I'll take that.

799
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:15,933
Because I'm losing my daughter,

800
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:18,395
and you know what that
will do to me, so if there's...

801
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:20,664
if there is even
a one-out-of-a-thousand chance

802
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:23,767
that you are talking
to our ex-wife,

803
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:27,738
then humor me. I beg you because
I'm at the end of my rope.

804
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:32,576
Jethro, tell me what sh-she says
I should do, please.

805
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,949
Okay.

806
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,951
Okay.

807
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,954
- She says...
DIANE: What?

808
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,692
What?

809
00:33:51,664 --> 00:33:54,031
Nice to know
things don't change.

810
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:55,666
Well, certainly
not that sweater.

811
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:57,668
God, I told you to get
rid of that years ago.

812
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,105
What do I do, Diane?

813
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,843
Stop trying to do anything.

814
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:09,613
Take off your Mr. Fix-It hat

815
00:34:09,682 --> 00:34:12,316
and just be there
for your daughter.

816
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,185
That's not very actionable.

817
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:17,287
Emily doesn't need
action right now,

818
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:19,790
she just needs her father,

819
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:22,392
not solutions.

820
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:25,629
You just be...

821
00:34:25,698 --> 00:34:28,398
her father.

822
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:31,868
I'm sorry
I couldn't protect you.

823
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:38,008
I'm sorry I didn't answer
the phone that night.

824
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:40,344
(phone rings)

825
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,879
Yeah. Gibbs.

826
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:44,581
McGEE:
Boss, hey.

827
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,717
We finished auditing
that doctor's records.

828
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:47,918
GIBBS:
And?

829
00:34:47,987 --> 00:34:49,553
He was telling the truth.

830
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:52,356
He wasn't prescribing enough
pills for Ralphie to deal.

831
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,658
Ralphie was prescribing them
to himself.

832
00:34:54,727 --> 00:34:57,027
Yeah, looks like Ralphie
stole a prescription pad

833
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:59,997
from the doctor's office,
has been forging scripts.

834
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:02,265
And then was getting them filled
with a pharmacist

835
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:04,167
who was willing to look
the other way.

836
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:05,669
Got a name, bring 'em in.

837
00:35:05,738 --> 00:35:07,371
Who?

838
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,806
Time to buy some more flowers.

839
00:35:09,842 --> 00:35:12,109
You're kidding me.
The flower Nazi?

840
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:13,377
Yup.

841
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:16,580
Thank you.

842
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,949
Don't mention it,
and by that, I mean...

843
00:35:19,018 --> 00:35:20,684
Never mention it.

844
00:35:20,753 --> 00:35:23,120
I know.

845
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:24,621
You had to know
the prescriptions

846
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,890
Ralphie was bringing you
were forged.

847
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:30,527
I mean, tens of thousands
of pills from the same doctor?

848
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:31,795
You can't prove
what I know.

849
00:35:31,864 --> 00:35:34,731
I can prove that the syringe

850
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,067
that was used to killed Ralphie
was sold in your store.

851
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,536
Yeah, I sell a lot of syringes.

852
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:40,804
So, what's funny

853
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:42,572
about this one is
that the murderer

854
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,641
tried to, uh, wipe it
of its prints,

855
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,909
but you know what he forgot?

856
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,045
It's not my problem.

857
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:50,480
He forgot to wipe the needle,

858
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:52,949
so we were able
to pull touch DNA,

859
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:56,486
and it was yours, in fact,

860
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:58,722
which kind of makes it
your problem now.

861
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,060
Just in time. He is about
to sing like a bird.

862
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:09,066
Look, it-it was
an accident, okay?

863
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:11,168
Who's Grumpelstiltskin now?

864
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:13,670
I-I got worried
when NCIS started

865
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:15,505
poking around.
I went to warn Ralphie,

866
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:18,575
and things just got out of hand.

867
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:21,645
And that's case closed,
gentlemen.

868
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,181
This case, yeah,
but if you want

869
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:26,483
to kill the snake,
you got to cut off the head.

870
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:28,485
Gibbs...

871
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:32,155
...we gonna go
all the way or not?

872
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,267
Don't forget the date.

873
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,638
What now?

874
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:53,710
Look,

875
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:55,345
it really was an accident.

876
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:58,281
Where'd you get the pills
you sold to Ralphie?

877
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,783
Same place I get
all my pills,

878
00:36:59,852 --> 00:37:02,018
from the pharmaceutical companies.
- No.

879
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:06,456
Emily Fornell had counterfeit
opioids in her blood.

880
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:10,127
Which means that
you were filling

881
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:13,563
Ralphie's forged prescription
with gray market pills.

882
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:15,699
Pills that were
coming across

883
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,801
the border from Canada,

884
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:20,170
so I hear.

885
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,505
From who?

886
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,174
Sounds like Gibbs been
working a side project.

887
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:30,380
I want a name.

888
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:32,048
No way.

889
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:33,483
You're going to prison
for murder.

890
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:35,519
You do not want to mess
with this guy.

891
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,888
Oh, yeah, I do.
Yeah, I do. Trust me.

892
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,089
Well, I don't.

893
00:37:39,158 --> 00:37:42,192
Maybe I go to prison,
maybe I-I get off.

894
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,327
You're not gonna get off.

895
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:46,496
I give you that name,
I'm a dead man.

896
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:51,168
You are already dead.

897
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:00,177
Emily...

898
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:01,378
I'm going back to my dorm.

899
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:02,924
I just came by
to pick up a few things.

900
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,948
- We need...
- To see Dr. Grace?

901
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:07,617
No, we don't, but maybe you do.

902
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,686
If you think so.

903
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:11,755
There's nothing wrong with me.

904
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:14,057
And nothing that
needs to be fixed.

905
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,525
And there's nothing
for you to do.

906
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:17,127
All I need from you

907
00:38:17,196 --> 00:38:20,730
is for you to leave me alone!

908
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:40,050
(softly):
I need help, Daddy.

909
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:42,485
I know.

910
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:47,090
(crying)

911
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,826
I'm so sorry.

912
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:53,630
I'm so, so sorry.

913
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,832
Me, too, baby. Me, too.

914
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:02,739
I love you so much.

915
00:39:04,977 --> 00:39:07,544
- Your mother, too.
- I know.

916
00:39:09,648 --> 00:39:10,981
She told me.

917
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:14,351
When I was in
the hospital,

918
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:16,019
I had a dream
that I saw her.

919
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:20,123
She said she loved me
to the moon and back

920
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:23,793
and that Gibbs's house
smelled like burnt cheese.

921
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,496
(laughs)

922
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:38,141
Yeah, we got him.

923
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,777
And I didn't have to get
all Pedro Hernandez

924
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:42,779
on anybody, either.

925
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:49,185
Except you're not done
with this one yet, are you?

926
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,890
Why are you here?

927
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:56,726
Aside from me losing my mind.

928
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:58,828
Oh, please,

929
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,831
you were never that sane
to begin with.

930
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,734
But why now?

931
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:08,371
Because you needed a kick
in the pants to take this case.

932
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,206
Remind me why again?

933
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:13,743
When you get
personally involved,

934
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:15,378
you make mistakes.

935
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,480
Right.

936
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:20,350
Except you and I both know
that that rule is crap.

937
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:24,821
The reason that you don't want
to get personally involved

938
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:28,158
is that you're afraid
to feel, Jethro.

939
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:32,062
Ever since your family
was killed,

940
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,898
you shut yourself off

941
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:37,367
so you wouldn't have
to get hurt again.

942
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:40,670
And work, the one place
where you were really alive,

943
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:42,906
well, couldn't have that,

944
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,908
so you had to build up walls
there, too.

945
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:51,681
And that is the reason that
I am really here, Jethro,

946
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,451
'cause now those walls
are starting to crumble.

947
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:57,854
You're starting
to let people in again,

948
00:40:57,923 --> 00:40:59,122
and it is scary

949
00:40:59,191 --> 00:41:04,461
and, for someone
like you, dangerous.

950
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:09,099
So you reached out for help.

951
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:12,202
Voilà.

952
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:15,638
I'm just talking to myself.

953
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:18,108
Yeah, maybe,

954
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,744
but at least
you're talking.

955
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:24,214
And when you're ready
to talk some more,

956
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:27,384
we're all here for you, inside.

957
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:29,886
All you got to do is ask.

958
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,460
You don't have to face
the danger alone.

959
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:48,972
(clattering upstairs)

960
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,608
All right, what now?

961
00:41:58,483 --> 00:41:59,949
Hello, Gibbs.

962
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:03,420
No time for pleasantries.

963
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:05,021
You're in danger.

964
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:13,463
Well, aren't you gonna
say something?

965
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:20,170
Ziva.
