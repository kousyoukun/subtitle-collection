1
00:00:03,018 --> 00:00:04,951
That necklace is beautiful.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,363
My boyfriend gave it to me.

3
00:00:06,364 --> 00:00:07,764
Then your assignment is over.

4
00:00:07,832 --> 00:00:09,532
End the relationship
immediately.

5
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:11,178
End the relationship
immediately.

6
00:00:11,202 --> 00:00:12,635
Gladly.

7
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:14,103
Your gift
was a recording device.

8
00:00:14,172 --> 00:00:15,316
Why the hell
are you following me?

9
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,620
This is an off-the-books
account.

10
00:00:16,675 --> 00:00:19,042
- Whose is it?
- United States Secretary of Defense.

11
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,878
I understand you've been
tracking Leon Vance.

12
00:00:23,848 --> 00:00:25,048
I want everything you have.

13
00:00:25,116 --> 00:00:27,617
<i>Six Klowny Kake ice cream bars</i>

14
00:00:27,686 --> 00:00:30,853
were partially cut open and
laced with strychnine poison.

15
00:00:30,922 --> 00:00:32,488
No DNA, no Crum.

16
00:00:32,557 --> 00:00:34,524
No Crum, no confession.

17
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:36,059
Mr. Crum, you're free to go.

18
00:00:38,063 --> 00:00:39,295
I've spent years in courtrooms

19
00:00:39,364 --> 00:00:41,364
watching people abuse
the system.

20
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:43,344
A system that's supposed
to protect the innocent,

21
00:00:43,368 --> 00:00:44,667
not free the guilty.

22
00:00:44,736 --> 00:00:46,169
<i>To balance the scales,</i>

23
00:00:46,237 --> 00:00:47,970
<i>sometimes you have</i>
<i>to apply pressure.</i>

24
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,540
Our hit man was paid with money
from SecDef's secret account?

25
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:52,542
- I'll call Clark.
- Have him meet us.

26
00:01:03,054 --> 00:01:04,987
Gibbs?

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,194
Director?

28
00:01:12,497 --> 00:01:15,098
Damn.

29
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:37,620
Hello?

30
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:39,622
Gibbs?

31
00:01:45,964 --> 00:01:47,764
Westley,
what are you doing?

32
00:01:47,832 --> 00:01:49,866
I could be asking you
the same question.

33
00:01:49,934 --> 00:01:51,701
You've been following me.

34
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,369
- You taught me well.
- Why?

35
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:55,204
- Who are you working for?
- You, I thought.

36
00:01:55,273 --> 00:01:57,106
Till you
kicked me out.

37
00:01:57,175 --> 00:01:59,976
I want back in. Whatever it is
you're working on with NCIS,

38
00:02:00,044 --> 00:02:01,410
let me help.

39
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:03,880
I did teach you well.
Who sent you?

40
00:02:03,948 --> 00:02:06,716
What's wrong with you?
Put the gun down.

41
00:02:06,785 --> 00:02:08,417
I asked you a question.

42
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:11,621
Stop,

43
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:12,922
and answer the damn question.

44
00:02:34,078 --> 00:02:35,845
Federal agents!

45
00:02:35,914 --> 00:02:37,280
In here!

46
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:39,348
- Mallory?
- Leon!

47
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:40,783
I'm unarmed.

48
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,455
Hands.

49
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,263
It's not what you think.

50
00:02:56,334 --> 00:03:00,334

You got to be

54
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,344
It still works.

55
00:03:41,412 --> 00:03:42,845
Mm, didn't it
used to be in color?

56
00:03:47,886 --> 00:03:49,585
- Hey. Morning, McGee.
- Hey.

57
00:03:49,654 --> 00:03:51,821
Hey, how was your, uh,
trip back in from California?

58
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,222
Early. Who is this?

59
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,258
CIA Officer Clark.

60
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:56,759
It's a shame, huh?

61
00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:02,765
Nick, you didn't say anything
in your text about a dead body.

62
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:04,367
Tim, why else
would I text you

63
00:04:04,435 --> 00:04:06,502
to come to Gibbs's house
as soon as you landed?

64
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:08,104
Well, I can think
of a few reasons.

65
00:04:08,172 --> 00:04:09,572
So what happened here?

66
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:11,941
Clark was meeting Gibbs.
Mallory got here first.

67
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,709
She said Clark
tried to kill her.

68
00:04:13,778 --> 00:04:14,877
What? Why?

69
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:17,079
Mallory shot back.

70
00:04:17,148 --> 00:04:19,782
Put one in the TV and
one in Clark's heart.

71
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:22,351
- Self-defense?
- According to Mallory.

72
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,888
Okay. Do we believe her?

73
00:04:25,957 --> 00:04:28,391
I acted in self-defense.

74
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:30,192
I'm telling you the truth, Leon.

75
00:04:30,261 --> 00:04:31,294
Well, that's a first.

76
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:34,430
Why were you following Clark?

77
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:37,400
And don't say it's your job.

78
00:04:37,468 --> 00:04:40,636
After Clark pulled me
off your surveillance,

79
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:43,139
he had my security clearance
downgraded.

80
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:45,541
It killed my credibility
at the Agency.

81
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,077
I thought I had done something
wrong, but now I think

82
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:50,279
there's something
that he didn't want me to see.

83
00:04:50,348 --> 00:04:52,782
And I think you all know
what it is.

84
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,453
I want back in.

85
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:02,325
This was to save face,
professionally?

86
00:05:02,393 --> 00:05:05,795
Do I really need
to say it, Leon?

87
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:09,098
Gibbs?

88
00:05:16,074 --> 00:05:18,007
Bourbon.

89
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:25,281
The last time we talked,

90
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,284
I didn't have a chance
to say I'm sorry.

91
00:05:28,353 --> 00:05:30,286
For everything.

92
00:05:31,522 --> 00:05:32,855
I know.

93
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:36,625
I really did have
feelings for you.

94
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:39,929
- I know.
- I was doing my job,

95
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:41,864
and fell in love.

96
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:45,701
Which one is wrong?

97
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,637
See? It's not
that easy to answer.

98
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:51,340
What am I supposed to say
to change all that?

99
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:57,947
You could say
you feel the same way.

100
00:05:59,884 --> 00:06:01,550
You can say,

101
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:03,219
in another life,

102
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:06,022
we'd be planning a vacation
to Cancun right now.

103
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:09,458
In another life.

104
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:14,563
But in this one, the CIA
is waiting to interrogate you.

105
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:21,404
My story won't change.

106
00:06:21,472 --> 00:06:23,906
It's the truth.

107
00:07:04,315 --> 00:07:06,415
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for waiting.

108
00:07:06,484 --> 00:07:08,551
I believe we are ready to begin.

109
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:10,186
Your Honor,
is it wise to meet so soon

110
00:07:10,254 --> 00:07:12,421
after your bailiff
was arrested for murder?

111
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,423
NCIS is getting too
close to uncovering

112
00:07:14,492 --> 00:07:16,225
his connection to this council.

113
00:07:16,294 --> 00:07:17,626
McKinney won't talk.

114
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:20,596
And all remaining funds
have been relocated.

115
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:24,633
Plus we are taking one
additional precaution.

116
00:07:24,702 --> 00:07:27,470
Have you all reviewed
the information I sent?

117
00:07:29,307 --> 00:07:31,740
Good. Regarding
the murder

118
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:34,210
of Pedro Juan Hernandez,

119
00:07:34,278 --> 00:07:36,946
how does this council
find the defendant,

120
00:07:37,014 --> 00:07:40,583
Gunnery Sergeant
Leroy Jethro Gibbs?

121
00:07:41,652 --> 00:07:44,653
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

122
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:46,555
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

123
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:50,126
- Guilty.
The decision is unanimous.

124
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:52,928
The verdict is so recorded.

125
00:07:52,997 --> 00:07:55,131
Your Honor, with
Bailiff McKinney in custody,

126
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,167
we'll need to find someone
to carry out the sentence.

127
00:07:59,303 --> 00:08:01,237
I already have.

128
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:11,384
The ice cream killer,
Stuart Crum,

129
00:08:11,385 --> 00:08:14,355
got off on a legal technicality,
and then was murdered.

130
00:08:14,356 --> 00:08:16,649
The man who killed
Crum was an assassin

131
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,109
paid from a secret
account belonging to

132
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,144
Secretary of Defense.

133
00:08:21,213 --> 00:08:24,247
We don't actually think SecDef
paid for the hit, do we?

134
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:25,748
I mean, it was his account.

135
00:08:25,817 --> 00:08:27,862
We still don't have proof that
he was controlling it.

136
00:08:27,886 --> 00:08:29,552
So find some.

137
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:30,510
Follow the money.

138
00:08:30,534 --> 00:08:31,722
It's easier said
than done, boss.

139
00:08:31,723 --> 00:08:33,890
We don't have all the records
on SecDef's account.

140
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,403
And our bailiff
hit man's not talking.

141
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:37,694
No wife, no friends,
no social media.

142
00:08:37,762 --> 00:08:39,170
He's a breathing dead end.

143
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:40,130
He has a boss, Bishop.

144
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:41,411
- Start with him.
- Judge Deakin.

145
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:42,794
- On it.
- Torres.

146
00:08:47,234 --> 00:08:49,935
Boss. I think the best way
to find proof on SecDef

147
00:08:50,003 --> 00:08:51,336
is to just
confront him.

148
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,938
Easier said than done, Tim.

149
00:08:53,006 --> 00:08:54,584
Well, I know Vance
isn't ready to go all in

150
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:56,019
on this one,
but you don't want to lose

151
00:08:56,043 --> 00:08:57,443
the element of surprise.
- Too late.

152
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:01,947
Agent Gibbs.

153
00:09:05,118 --> 00:09:07,319
Maybe you should join us.

154
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:14,025
Somebody has been accessing

155
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:17,629
an old offshore account
in my name.

156
00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:20,632
I have no idea who, or why.

157
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:22,133
Which is why I'm here.

158
00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:24,135
Sunlight is the best
disinfectant, boys.

159
00:09:24,204 --> 00:09:25,737
So, you got questions,

160
00:09:25,806 --> 00:09:27,138
ask away.

161
00:09:29,242 --> 00:09:30,909
The account.
What is it?

162
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:32,711
Take a look.

163
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:34,479
Asked you, Mr. Secretary.

164
00:09:34,548 --> 00:09:36,915
I was an undersecretary
back in 2002.

165
00:09:36,984 --> 00:09:39,484
Office of Finance. I opened
that account in connection

166
00:09:39,553 --> 00:09:41,720
with several national
security operations.

167
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:44,689
Off the books?
Post 9/11, things moved fast.

168
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:48,560
Bookkeeping was not at the top
of our list of priorities.

169
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:50,562
That account
got lost in the shuffle.

170
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,697
- Hundreds of millions?
- It's D.C., Leon.

171
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:53,898
Sir, you have DoD,

172
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:55,900
FBI and a whole host
of federal acronyms

173
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:58,103
at your disposal.
Why come to us?

174
00:09:58,171 --> 00:10:03,008
Well... last time
our paths crossed,

175
00:10:03,076 --> 00:10:04,676
I didn't like you
peeking under my hood.

176
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:08,013
So, I decided to take a peek
under yours.

177
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:10,626
Did you find
what you were looking for?

178
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,218
What I found was
even worse than dirt.

179
00:10:13,286 --> 00:10:16,688
You really are a good man
who runs a tight ship. You both.

180
00:10:16,757 --> 00:10:18,690
- Last man who said that is dead.
- Yeah, well,

181
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,525
I don't know anything
about Clark's death.

182
00:10:20,594 --> 00:10:22,360
But I'm offering you
everything I have.

183
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:24,362
The offshore
account records

184
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:25,797

185
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:27,032
All of them.

186
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,200
Now it's your turn.

187
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:34,372
Can you tell me
who's been using this account?

188
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:35,014
Not yet.

189
00:10:35,015 --> 00:10:37,653
But you do know what
they've been using it for.

190
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:46,117
Gentlemen,
trust is a two-way street.

191
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:49,587
Yes, sir. I will let you know
as soon as we have more.

Whoa. Well, I know where I'm

194
00:11:16,516 --> 00:11:18,516

- ShowBiz Pizza.

I was seven.

196
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,088
Special Agents
Bishop and Torres.

197
00:11:23,156 --> 00:11:24,289
Judge Deakin.

198
00:11:24,357 --> 00:11:26,124
Thanks for meeting
me here, uh...

199
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:28,760
You called just as I was
on my way out of the courthouse.

200
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:30,361
Yeah, this place
is incredible.

201

Isn't it?
Labor of love for a long time.

202
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:34,532
It's yours?

203
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:36,334
Indeed it is.

204
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:39,270
I did most of the
restoration myself.

205
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:41,306
Working with my hands
keeps me sane.

206
00:11:41,374 --> 00:11:43,475
Definitely more fun
than a boat in a basement.

207
00:11:43,543 --> 00:11:45,276
- What's that?
- Long story.

208
00:11:45,345 --> 00:11:47,378
And it's not why you're here.

209
00:11:47,447 --> 00:11:50,148
Your bailiff, Colt McKinney,
he's been arrested for murder.

210
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:52,056
I heard.
Awful.

211
00:11:52,057 --> 00:11:53,952
You've worked
with him for six years.

212
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,321
Any signs of this guy
going off the rails?

213
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:57,989
No.

214
00:11:58,058 --> 00:12:02,127
Although, the job has
its share of frustrations.

215
00:12:02,195 --> 00:12:04,529
Justice is not always served.

216
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,799
Anybody who might want to take
advantage of those frustrations?

217
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:10,135
We don't think McKinney
was working alone.

218
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:11,193
Really? What makes you say that?

219
00:12:11,217 --> 00:12:12,638
He got paid for the hit.

220
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,374
Y-You're telling me
my bailiff is a hit man?

221
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:17,742
For whom?

222
00:12:17,811 --> 00:12:20,211
Well, we were hoping that
you could help us find out.

223
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:25,016
It breaks my heart
to have the law corrupted.

224
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:27,585
A bad man gets away
with murder, leading to

225
00:12:27,654 --> 00:12:29,988
a-a man I thought was good
committing it.

226
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:32,023
Good men don't commit murder.

227
00:12:32,092 --> 00:12:35,493
They shouldn't have to.
The system failed.

228
00:12:37,097 --> 00:12:39,208
That's not exactly what I'd
expect to hear from a judge.

229
00:12:39,232 --> 00:12:40,865
I'm not condoning it.

230
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:44,068
I'll tell you what,

231
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:46,571
you sit on the bench for
40 years, and then we'll talk.

232
00:12:47,774 --> 00:12:49,274
Huh?

233
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:53,545
You two know anything about,
uh, vintage pin setters?

234
00:12:53,613 --> 00:12:55,513
Lane two is on the fritz,

235
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:57,182
needs a little TLC.

236
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:08,860
This can't be right.
Check it again.

237
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:12,130
Because the fifth time's
a charm?

238
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:14,933
What do we got?
We've been processing

239
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:16,901
the bank records from SecDef.
- Mm-hmm. And?

240
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,938
Well, what we're finding
is very strange.

241
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:21,940
I think there's something else
we need to check.

242
00:13:22,008 --> 00:13:24,876
No, we don't.
Just tell him.

243
00:13:24,945 --> 00:13:26,750
Tell him what?

244
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:30,882
Well, since you asked, follow me.

245
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:32,650
So, Stuart Crum,

246
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:34,252
aka...
- Ice cream killer.

247
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:36,254
Guilty, but he got off
on a technicality.

248
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:37,889
The next day,
Crum is found dead,

249
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,891
and we know that the
hit man who killed him

250
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,240
was paid out of
SecDef's account.

251
00:13:41,294 --> 00:13:43,428
But check this out,
we found six

252
00:13:43,496 --> 00:13:45,463
other withdrawals
from that same account

253
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:47,232
over the past
three years.

254
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,967
Each one was sent
to a city that,

255
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:51,013
just the week before,
had a high-profile murder case

256
00:13:51,037 --> 00:13:53,137
get dismissed
by a technicality.

257
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:56,007
In each case, the suspected
killer ends up dead.

258
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:59,244
I mean, holy vigilante
justice, Batman,

259
00:13:59,312 --> 00:14:01,946
but in this case, it's like
a nationwide network

260
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:03,348
of vigilante justice.

261
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,016
Someone is having
killers killed. Who?

262
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:07,118
Don't know.
The money's a dead end.

263
00:14:07,187 --> 00:14:08,953
Assuming SecDef
is telling the truth,

264
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:12,257
there's no way to track exactly
who's controlling his account.

265
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:13,524
Find a way, Kase.

266

Boss, you really buying this?

Got anything else, McGee?

Yeah, I'm buying it.

322
00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:12,832
Oh...

323
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:15,401
You actually fell
for this woman, huh?

324
00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:19,572
Cupid usually shoots arrows,

325
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:22,408
but you're walking around with
a harpoon in your chest, huh?

326
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,176
It's over. I know that, Jack.

327
00:18:24,245 --> 00:18:26,812
Do you?

328
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:28,681
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

329
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,529
Could I have done something
a little different?

330
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:34,820
Oh...

331
00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:36,289
Leon, honey...

332
00:18:36,357 --> 00:18:39,292
This is not your fault.

333
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,128
When I first put together
that she was CIA,

334
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:43,529
I could've called her out.

335
00:18:43,598 --> 00:18:46,332
You put the security
of this agency

336
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:47,767
above your
personal feelings.

337
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,635
But I don't think
that's a good foundation

338
00:18:49,704 --> 00:18:50,937
for happily ever after.

339
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,972
Maybe you need
to lower the bar a bit.

340
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,474
If your goal
is "happily ever after,"

341
00:18:55,543 --> 00:18:57,343
I think you got into
the wrong business.

342
00:18:57,412 --> 00:18:59,812
Or maybe you should
just date a librarian,

343
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:01,258
so you won't have
this problem again.

344
00:19:01,282 --> 00:19:05,651
Stay away from undercover
CIA agents, that's your advice?

345
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,955
I mean, it's practical.

346
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,958
But this isn't about finding
someone new, is it?

347
00:19:14,228 --> 00:19:16,996
Hey, Gibbs, checking in, again.

348
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,069
Hey, Elaine!

349
00:19:23,137 --> 00:19:25,638
- Agent Bishop.
- What happened here?

350
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:28,040
Gibbs happened.
He didn't tell you?

351
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:29,241
Tell me what?

352
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,911
Late last night,
Gibbs was heading home.

353
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,620
Next thing I know,
we heard shots outside.

354
00:19:33,648 --> 00:19:35,081
Gunshots?

355
00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:37,316
Gibbs is okay, didn't even
spill his coffees.

356
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:40,052
So wh-who did the shooting?
What did the police find?

357
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:42,989
Not Gibbs. He took off
before the cops got here.

358
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,297
And after fielding questions
with these yahoos all night,

359
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:46,492
I understand why.

360
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:49,028
I told them I didn't see
who was shooting.

361
00:19:49,097 --> 00:19:52,164
Matter of fact, I didn't
tell them who was shot at.

362
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:55,167
I assumed Gibbs left
for a reason.

363
00:19:57,271 --> 00:19:59,538
You sure that it was Gibbs'
truck that was hit?

364
00:19:59,607 --> 00:20:00,740
Where did he go?

365
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:02,008
I-I told you
everything I know.

366
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,409
I just want to say,

367
00:20:03,478 --> 00:20:06,779
any time you guys need a safe,
secluded space for gossip,

368
00:20:06,848 --> 00:20:10,249
Autopsy's all yours.
Gets really lonely down here.

369
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,419
So what are we supposed
to say to Gibbs?

370
00:20:13,488 --> 00:20:14,687
Um, nothing.

371
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,188
We're just gonna ignore this?

372
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,890
- As opposed to...?
- I don't know,

373
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:20,126
talk to him. I mean,
you had the guts to fire him.

374
00:20:20,194 --> 00:20:21,205
And I lived to talk about it.

375
00:20:21,229 --> 00:20:22,628
You think I'm gonna
push my luck?

376
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:24,597
So no one's gonna
confront Gibbs?

377
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:25,966
About what?

378
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:28,401
Gibbs! These guys
just showed up down here.

379
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:31,570
I-I told you, I have work
to do, people.

380
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:33,606
Update.

381
00:20:33,674 --> 00:20:35,519
I left you a couple
messages this morning.

382
00:20:35,543 --> 00:20:37,376
Is everything okay?

383
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:40,279
Car trouble. Update.

384
00:20:40,348 --> 00:20:42,114
Ah, Agent Torres,

385
00:20:42,183 --> 00:20:44,216
there you are.

386
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,586
- Am I, uh, interrupting?
- Uh, no. I was

387
00:20:47,655 --> 00:20:49,155
just about to tell Gibbs that I

388
00:20:49,223 --> 00:20:50,467
came to you for
some information.

389
00:20:50,491 --> 00:20:53,292
And, clearly,
here you are

390
00:20:53,361 --> 00:20:56,262
- with that information.
- Indeed I am.

391
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,666
I pulled the records of your
six vigilante murder cases,

392
00:21:00,735 --> 00:21:04,003
and I discovered an
intriguing connection.

393
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:05,571
What kind of connection, Duck?

394
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,275
These six murders
span four states,

395
00:21:09,343 --> 00:21:11,143
each in a different city,

396
00:21:11,212 --> 00:21:15,314
each in a different jurisdiction
with different judges.

397
00:21:15,383 --> 00:21:17,683
However, on closer inspection,

398
00:21:17,752 --> 00:21:19,952
each of these
four judges

399
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:22,288
have something
in common.

400
00:21:25,426 --> 00:21:28,260
They all clerked for one man.

401
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:32,531
Judge Deakin.

402
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,301
A federal judge running
a vigilante network?

403
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:36,669
We can't prove anything.

404
00:21:36,737 --> 00:21:39,772
No, not yet.

405
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:42,041
Keep digging.

406
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,010
Okay, where is he going now?

407
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,879
Damn good question.

408
00:21:46,948 --> 00:21:50,516
As NCIS historian, I have become
somewhat isolated

409
00:21:50,585 --> 00:21:52,051
down in my new office,

410
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,620
but since when has
Gibbs' whereabouts been

411
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:56,522
so hotly contested?

412
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:58,057
Don't ask, Duck.

413
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:10,669
Wood shifts.

414
00:22:10,738 --> 00:22:12,204
Hard to keep
an even surface.

415
00:22:12,273 --> 00:22:13,672
Preaching to the choir.

416
00:22:13,741 --> 00:22:17,143
Anything beats
synthetic lanes.

417
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,979
Even if it means maintaining
the wood's original shape.

418
00:22:22,483 --> 00:22:23,816
Original shape's a tree.

419
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:26,385
Funny.

420
00:22:26,454 --> 00:22:28,087
I thought I locked that door.

421
00:22:28,156 --> 00:22:29,989
You did.

422
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,491
I think you dropped this.

423
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,562
Looks like
a charming fellow.

424
00:22:36,631 --> 00:22:38,030
You know him?

425
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:40,065
I did.

426
00:22:40,134 --> 00:22:43,736
He killed my family.
Now he's dead.

427
00:22:45,473 --> 00:22:47,106
What's this about,
Agent Gibbs?

428
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:51,277
You want me dead?
Here I am.

429
00:22:51,345 --> 00:22:54,880
Want you dead?

430
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,558
This have something to do
with this photo?

431
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,921
He doesn't look like
he died of old age.

432
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:04,023
You want to judge me, Judge?

433
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,259
Man up.
Do your own dirty work.

434
00:23:07,328 --> 00:23:10,763
Man up?

435
00:23:10,831 --> 00:23:12,698
Like you did?

436
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,267
You put your thumb
on the scale

437
00:23:15,336 --> 00:23:18,437
and created justice
where there was none,

438
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:20,072
and made the world right.

439
00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:22,141
No, not even close.

440
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,443
Needed to be done.

441
00:23:24,512 --> 00:23:26,378
But now you want me dead
for it.

442
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:31,750
You condemn me for something
I did years ago...

443
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:33,085
while you're still doing it.

444
00:23:33,154 --> 00:23:34,453
That's an interesting theory,

445
00:23:34,522 --> 00:23:37,056
but you can't prove
a word of it.

446
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,624
Maybe that's why you came alone?

447
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:44,563
Or maybe, deep down,
you really believe

448
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,765
in justice at all costs.

449
00:23:50,238 --> 00:23:52,504
Not about justice.

450
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:56,108
Justice is your excuse.

451
00:23:56,177 --> 00:24:00,579
Because I'm coming for you...

452
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,181
and you're scared.

453
00:24:03,884 --> 00:24:07,253
And you're alone.

454
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:10,289
Because they don't know
what you did, do they?

455
00:24:10,358 --> 00:24:11,657
Your team.

456
00:24:13,928 --> 00:24:16,962
And you're too ashamed
to tell 'em the truth.

457
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,268
Agent Gibbs, I think
we're accusing each other

458
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,970
of the same thing.

459
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,772
Maybe we're on the same team.

460
00:24:29,443 --> 00:24:30,443
No, we're not.

461
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:14,257
Morning, Nick.

462
00:25:14,326 --> 00:25:16,826
Hey, yo.

463
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:18,595
Was that meant for us?

464
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:20,130
Or did he just have a stroke?

465
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:22,332
Excuse me.

466
00:25:23,902 --> 00:25:25,835
The last man who made
that hand gesture at me

467
00:25:25,904 --> 00:25:27,003
is now missing a hand.

468
00:25:27,072 --> 00:25:29,139
What? It means "campfire."

469
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:30,140
Then just say campfire.

470
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:32,309
Campfire. Now.

471
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:41,351
Hey, what's up?

472
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,920
We have a problem.

473
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,923
I followed Gibbs last night.

474
00:25:46,992 --> 00:25:48,858
Uh, that's a <i>you</i> problem.

475
00:25:48,927 --> 00:25:50,327
He's not gonna be happy
about that.

476
00:25:50,395 --> 00:25:53,163
He went to the judge
without telling us.

477
00:25:53,232 --> 00:25:54,709
Why is he cutting us out?
I don't know.

478
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:56,544
But it has to do with
the shooting at the diner.

479
00:25:56,568 --> 00:25:58,268
- I see how this looks.
- Bad.

480
00:25:58,337 --> 00:26:00,381
Well, what are we supposed
to do? We supposed to step in

481
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:02,439
every time boss makes
a move without telling us?

482
00:26:02,507 --> 00:26:03,940
This is different.

483
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:05,587
I mean, the guy's car
just got sprayed with bullets,

484
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:06,977
and we have no idea why.

485
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:09,980
We can't do our jobs
if we're always in the dark.

486
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,548
Maybe he's trying to protect us.

487
00:26:11,617 --> 00:26:13,516
From what?
If we're in danger,

488
00:26:13,585 --> 00:26:14,862
wouldn't-wouldn't you want
to know?

489
00:26:14,886 --> 00:26:17,787
McGee, you have to handle this.

490
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:19,789
Yeah, I can't keep
firing Gibbs.

491
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:20,957
Just talk to him.

492
00:26:21,026 --> 00:26:23,693
All right, fine.
But if I crash and burn,

493
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:24,961
you two are coming with.

494
00:26:41,854 --> 00:26:43,821
Update. Go.

495
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:55,466
Actually, boss, before that...

496
00:27:03,242 --> 00:27:05,142
Nope.

497
00:27:05,211 --> 00:27:06,897
What does he mean, "nope"?

498
00:27:07,075 --> 00:27:08,186
We didn't even say anything.

499
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,814
McGee.

500
00:27:29,736 --> 00:27:31,702
Boss, we should talk.

501
00:27:36,442 --> 00:27:37,675
Look, whatever's going on,

502
00:27:37,744 --> 00:27:39,643
we need to know,
no matter what it is.

503
00:27:44,016 --> 00:27:45,850
It's personal.

504
00:27:45,918 --> 00:27:48,385
Shooting at the diner,
maybe?

505
00:27:48,454 --> 00:27:51,155
Yeah, we know about that.

506
00:27:51,224 --> 00:27:53,157
We're detectives.

507
00:27:53,226 --> 00:27:55,192
But once you talked
to the judge,

508
00:27:55,261 --> 00:27:56,627
you made it about the case.

509
00:27:56,696 --> 00:27:58,395
The two have to
be connected.

510
00:27:58,464 --> 00:28:00,965
Now, I get it if you don't want
to tell us why, boss,

511
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:03,734
but after all we've
been through with you,

512
00:28:03,803 --> 00:28:05,280
you think there's anything
you could say

513
00:28:05,304 --> 00:28:06,370
that would surprise us?

514
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:11,008
I killed the man
who killed my family.

515
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,414
Deakin knows.

516
00:28:17,483 --> 00:28:21,018
He's using it against me
to get me off this case.

517
00:28:50,983 --> 00:28:53,551
And don't ever follow me again!

518
00:29:02,195 --> 00:29:05,896
I was just on my way up.

519
00:29:05,965 --> 00:29:07,789
Unless this is a bad time.

520
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,617
What do you got?

521
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:10,506
I got a whole heap of lies.

522
00:29:20,546 --> 00:29:21,712
I postponed a sit-down

523
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:23,025
with the Turkish defense
minister for this.

524
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:24,648
- I hope you have news.
- We do, sir.

525
00:29:24,717 --> 00:29:27,384
- Good.
- Not for you.

526
00:29:31,324 --> 00:29:32,823
- What's this?
- Phone records.

527
00:29:32,892 --> 00:29:34,124
Do you recognize your number?

528
00:29:34,193 --> 00:29:35,993
It seems that you
and CIA Officer

529
00:29:36,062 --> 00:29:37,828
Mallory Madden
have been awfully chatty.

530
00:29:37,897 --> 00:29:39,797
A fact that you both
have failed to mention.

531
00:29:39,866 --> 00:29:40,998
About that two-way street.

532
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:43,434
Yeah, well,

533
00:29:43,502 --> 00:29:44,980
Mallory came to me,
told me that Clark

534
00:29:45,004 --> 00:29:47,004
had been nosing around
my old account.

535
00:29:47,073 --> 00:29:48,839
Out of the goodness
of her heart, I'm sure.

536
00:29:48,908 --> 00:29:51,286
She'd been demoted and needed
some new friends in high places,

537
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,977
and I wanted to know
what Clark was up to.

538
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:54,445
So I asked her to find out.

539
00:29:54,513 --> 00:29:56,480
- At all costs?
- No.

540
00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:58,515
I never asked her to kill Clark.

541
00:29:58,584 --> 00:30:00,517
And when I found out
she had,

542
00:30:00,586 --> 00:30:02,186
I came to you.
- Yeah, and you lied.

543
00:30:02,255 --> 00:30:04,021
I withheld,
because it looked bad.

544
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,023
Still does.

545
00:30:07,493 --> 00:30:09,126
- Where's Mallory now?
- I have no idea.

546
00:30:09,195 --> 00:30:10,395
I gave her the
account records,

547
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:12,696
told her to keep digging,
and then nothing.

548
00:30:12,765 --> 00:30:14,209
She must have found something
more valuable

549
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:15,466
than friends in high places.

550
00:30:15,534 --> 00:30:17,334
- Such as?
- You tell me.

551
00:30:17,403 --> 00:30:19,648
I was hoping NCIS had something
in the works.

552
00:30:19,672 --> 00:30:21,839
- Hey, Gibbs.
- Yeah, Kase.

553
00:30:21,908 --> 00:30:24,208
- I'm on my way down.
- What's that?

554
00:30:24,277 --> 00:30:26,710
Something in the works.

555
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:32,483
So I dusted the image
for fingerprints,

556
00:30:32,551 --> 00:30:34,351
and other than yours,
I found none.

557
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,787
- Totally clean.
- The bullets?

558
00:30:36,856 --> 00:30:39,957
You did a great job of
digging them out of your truck.

559
00:30:40,026 --> 00:30:41,358
They're all totally intact.

560
00:30:41,427 --> 00:30:42,526
Also totally clean.

561
00:30:42,595 --> 00:30:45,462
- Gotta have something here, Kase.
- Oh.

562
00:30:45,531 --> 00:30:46,411
Well, that brings me back
to the photo.

563
00:30:46,435 --> 00:30:47,732
You said it was clean.

564
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:49,667
There's normal forensics
scientist clean,

565
00:30:49,735 --> 00:30:51,735
and then there's
Kasie Hines clean.

566
00:30:51,771 --> 00:30:55,172
So this is the computer
program I ran after making

567
00:30:55,241 --> 00:30:56,907
a super high-res scan.

568
00:30:56,976 --> 00:30:59,343
If there is anything unusual,
this thing will find it.

569
00:30:59,412 --> 00:31:01,145
It could find a flaw in Beyoncé.

570
00:31:01,213 --> 00:31:02,513
- Did it?
- Beyoncé?

571
00:31:02,581 --> 00:31:05,015
No. Photo, yes.

572
00:31:05,084 --> 00:31:08,052
While there are no latent prints
on the image,

573
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,254
I found a partial print
in the image itself.

574
00:31:10,323 --> 00:31:12,656
- In the ink.
- Somebody touched it?

575
00:31:12,725 --> 00:31:15,926
Right after it was printed,
just before the ink dried.

576
00:31:15,962 --> 00:31:16,962
Well, run it.

577
00:31:16,996 --> 00:31:18,762
- I have been.
- Yeah? And?

578
00:31:18,831 --> 00:31:20,831
Still running.

579
00:31:22,335 --> 00:31:24,935
So, uh, this photo was
on your dashboard

580
00:31:25,004 --> 00:31:26,537
while you were being shot at.

581
00:31:26,605 --> 00:31:28,005
You want to tell me
who this man is?

582
00:31:28,074 --> 00:31:30,240
The print, Kase.

583
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:33,744
Well, it's a partial print,
which greatly increases

584
00:31:33,813 --> 00:31:35,379
the number of potential matches.

585
00:31:35,448 --> 00:31:37,114
But the odds of getting
an immediate hit

586
00:31:37,183 --> 00:31:39,616
on any print are--

587
00:31:39,685 --> 00:31:40,851
Huh. I got a hit.

588
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
You got a name?

589
00:31:41,954 --> 00:31:46,690
It belongs to CIA Officer
Mallory Madden.

590
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,461
- Isn't that...
- The director's ex-girlfriend.

591
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:52,730
Well, the director's
ex-girlfriend tried to kill you.

592
00:32:03,754 --> 00:32:06,215
Mallory doesn't usually miss
her target.

593
00:32:06,893 --> 00:32:09,060
Yeah, I've seen.

594
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:11,829
Then why are you
still breathing?

595
00:32:11,898 --> 00:32:14,165
I got a lot of questions.

596
00:32:14,234 --> 00:32:15,933
Like why is my ex
trying to kill you?

597
00:32:16,002 --> 00:32:17,568
I'm not the one
who broke her heart.

598
00:32:17,637 --> 00:32:19,570
I'm guessing

599
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:20,838
it was about money.

600
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:23,285
She's working
for Judge Deakin.

601
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:24,375
But how did
she find him?

602
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:25,843
Same way we did.

603
00:32:25,912 --> 00:32:28,112
SecDef gave her
the account records.

604
00:32:28,181 --> 00:32:29,514
The same records he gave us.

605
00:32:29,582 --> 00:32:31,115
And she followed
those same breadcrumbs

606
00:32:31,184 --> 00:32:33,351
all the way to Deakin? When?
- It doesn't matter.

607
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,752
Yeah, it does. It does to me.

608
00:32:34,821 --> 00:32:36,521
We only need her
to get to Deakin.

609
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:38,634
Down in the basement, Gibbs,
was she telling the truth?

610
00:32:38,658 --> 00:32:40,925
Did she know what was going on
the entire time?

611
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:43,060
Leon, you're asking
the wrong person.

612
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:46,731
Let's find her.

613
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:55,706
Thanks. Okay, FAA and TSA have
Mallory on a watch list.

614
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:57,575
Border checkpoints
are on high alert.

615
00:32:57,644 --> 00:33:00,211
Still waiting on a list
of her known aliases.

616
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,713
CIA has me on hold, again.

617
00:33:02,782 --> 00:33:04,293
And no activity
on her Internet accounts,

618
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:06,117
and her cell phone
is still turned off.

619
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:07,185
Yeah.

620
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,386
Great. Can you
send me those?

621
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:11,055
The aliases are on their way.

622
00:33:11,124 --> 00:33:13,891
About time. Where are we?

623
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
Mallory's cell hasn't
been used in days.

624
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:17,461
The Agency hasn't heard from her

625
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,764
since she was cleared
in Clark's death.

626
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,732
Yeah, no hits
on the BOLO, either.

627
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:23,568
Mallory's a trained
CIA operative.

628
00:33:23,636 --> 00:33:24,969
She knows how to disappear.

629
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:26,181
Well, she's not
going anywhere

630
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:27,738
until she finishes
her job.

631
00:33:27,807 --> 00:33:29,273
By job, you mean...

632
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:30,474
Putting a bullet in my head.

633
00:33:30,543 --> 00:33:31,943
Hey, boss,

634
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:33,511
I've got something here.

635
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,247
Mallory just turned on her
cell phone and her GPS tracker.

636
00:33:36,316 --> 00:33:38,149
So either our
CIA operative is sloppy,

637
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:39,584
or it's a trap.

638
00:33:39,652 --> 00:33:41,485
She's not sloppy. Where is she?

639
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:43,921
She's at your diner.

640
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,795
Hey. Come on, all of you.
Let's go.

641
00:33:57,403 --> 00:34:00,104
That's good.
I like to leave room for cream.

642
00:34:00,173 --> 00:34:01,339
Can I get you anything else?

643
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:03,274
No. Thank you.

644
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:17,655
Good coffee here.

645
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:19,957
Keep both hands
on the table.

646
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:26,897
I'm not here to fight.

647
00:34:26,966 --> 00:34:30,034
I'm here to turn myself in.

648
00:34:30,103 --> 00:34:32,370
Figured this was
as good a place as any.

649
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:33,904
Get up.

650
00:34:35,942 --> 00:34:38,342
I screwed up.

651
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:40,745
Tell Leon
this was just business.

652
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:44,548
Tell him yourself.

653
00:34:44,617 --> 00:34:47,518
After everything that's
happened with Leon, Clark, you,

654
00:34:47,587 --> 00:34:49,987
this woman turns
herself in? Why?

655
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:52,223
Hoping to find out.

656
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:55,359
You think it's wise to send
a jilted lover into that room?

657
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:58,195
It's not my call.

658
00:34:58,264 --> 00:34:59,830
Gibbs.

659
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:05,536
You have the right
to remain silent.

660
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:07,416
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

661
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,572
in a court of law.

662
00:35:08,641 --> 00:35:10,107
I've been read my rights.

663
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:11,720
You have the right
to an attorney, and to have

664
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,921
an attorney present
for any questioning.

665
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:15,346
Leon, stop. What are you doing?

666
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:16,925
Doing my job.
Which is what you were doing

667
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:18,382
before you became
a gun for hire.

668
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:20,384
- I can explain.
- Please do.

669
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:23,087
Over the past few weeks,
I lost everything

670
00:35:23,156 --> 00:35:24,455
that mattered to me.

671
00:35:24,524 --> 00:35:27,024
My credibility, my job
and then you.

672
00:35:27,093 --> 00:35:29,293
Clark's murder.

673
00:35:29,362 --> 00:35:30,795
It really was self-defense.

674
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:32,630
Even your own investigation
says so.

675
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:35,466
But you knew about the account
and you knew about Judge Deakin.

676
00:35:35,535 --> 00:35:37,468
- Yes.
- You lied to me.

677
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,105
You were working for Deakin.

678
00:35:41,174 --> 00:35:42,614
Only after you said
we had no future,

679
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:44,975
which meant I needed
a way to start over.

680
00:35:45,044 --> 00:35:46,811
As a hit man?

681
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:48,813
What the hell is wrong with you?

682
00:35:48,881 --> 00:35:50,915
It was gonna be enough money
to leave the country

683
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,383
and put all of this behind me.

684
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:53,662
Do you know how crazy
that sounds?

685
00:35:53,686 --> 00:35:54,952
I didn't at the time.

686
00:35:55,021 --> 00:35:57,488
But once I learned
the target was Gibbs,

687
00:35:57,557 --> 00:35:59,123
I couldn't go through with it.

688
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:03,494
Do you really think
I missed by accident?

689
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:07,498
I made a deal with Judge Deakin
to take Gibbs out,

690
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:09,767
so I had to make it
look believable.

691
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:12,636
Otherwise, I'd be the one
with a bullet in my head.

692
00:36:12,705 --> 00:36:14,171
Ah, so you're the victim?

693
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,006
No.

694
00:36:16,075 --> 00:36:18,175
But I did buy Gibbs some time.

695
00:36:19,812 --> 00:36:21,812
And now I have
something else to offer.

696
00:36:21,881 --> 00:36:23,881
Of course you do. There's
always an angle with you.

697
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:25,015
Okay. No more.

698
00:36:25,084 --> 00:36:27,017
We're done.

699
00:36:31,758 --> 00:36:33,924
Talk.

700
00:36:33,993 --> 00:36:35,926
Judge Deakin.

701
00:36:35,995 --> 00:36:39,630
He hired me personally,
and I'm willing to testify.

702
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:42,833
Oh, that's great. The word of
a lying, disgraced CIA officer

703
00:36:42,902 --> 00:36:45,369
against that of a
respected federal judge.

704
00:36:45,438 --> 00:36:47,104
You don't have to take
my word for it.

705
00:36:47,173 --> 00:36:49,039
Then whose?

706
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:09,493
I heard you come in this time.

707
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:11,662
Welcome back, Gibbs.

708
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:12,797
Change your mind?

709
00:37:12,865 --> 00:37:13,964
No.

710
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:15,533
What, then?

711
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:17,535
Come to kill me, too,
just like old Pedro?

712
00:37:19,372 --> 00:37:21,405
No more games.

713
00:37:21,474 --> 00:37:23,407
You want me dead?

714
00:37:26,145 --> 00:37:28,078
Pick it up,
pull the trigger.

715
00:37:28,147 --> 00:37:29,880
Take responsibility.

716
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:49,934
- You scratched the wood.
- Pick it up!

717
00:37:50,002 --> 00:37:51,769
And give you a reason
to arrest me?

718
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:53,404
Is it even loaded?

719
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,914
I'm not gonna shoot you, Gibbs.

720
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,253
You may regret that.

721
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:11,622
What the hell are you doing?

722
00:38:11,691 --> 00:38:12,857
You're under arrest.

723
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,560
Brought my team this time.

724
00:38:18,531 --> 00:38:20,364
You're gonna put a man
like me in chains,

725
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:22,199
you better have
a damn good reason.

726
00:38:22,268 --> 00:38:24,235
Oh, we do.
We got Mallory.

727
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:25,436
She had a lot to say.

728
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:27,872
Oh, what is this, Gibbs?

729
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,528
You think her word
carries any weight?

730
00:38:29,552 --> 00:38:30,375
No.

731
00:38:30,376 --> 00:38:32,409
But yours do.

732
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:34,144
What happened?

733
00:38:34,213 --> 00:38:35,579
Why isn't Gibbs dead?

734
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,414
I need more time.

735
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,250
Maybe I need to hire
a better shot.

736
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:40,484
That recording

737
00:38:40,553 --> 00:38:42,052
was illegally obtained.

738
00:38:42,121 --> 00:38:44,655
Virginia is a one-party consent
state for recording.

739
00:38:44,724 --> 00:38:46,490
You, of all people,
should know that.

740
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,895
You should also know
not to trust a spy.

741
00:38:50,963 --> 00:38:52,329
Recognize this?

742
00:38:52,398 --> 00:38:53,898
You should.

743
00:38:53,966 --> 00:38:55,633
Mallory was wearing it
when you hired her.

744
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:57,735
She set me up.

745
00:38:57,803 --> 00:38:59,436
Yeah, tell it to the judge.

746
00:39:09,015 --> 00:39:11,015
Your challenge coin.

747
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,161
I had new ones made up
when I was appointed to the job

748
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:14,518
five years ago.

749
00:39:14,587 --> 00:39:16,820
Highest rank gets
free drinks at the bar.

750
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:18,622
There's only one coin
higher than this.

751
00:39:18,691 --> 00:39:21,158
I'm supposed to give them out
as a sign of respect

752
00:39:21,227 --> 00:39:22,493
and admiration.

753
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:23,561
This is my first.

754
00:39:23,596 --> 00:39:24,828
I don't know what to say.

755
00:39:24,897 --> 00:39:26,864
You tracked the missing
funds to Judge Deakin.

756
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:31,001
Meaning NCIS has officially
saved my ass, again.

757
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,615
We just did our job, sir.

758
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:34,439
Anything you
need, Leon,

759
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,040
you call me.

760
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:37,474
- Sir, I...
- Leon.

761
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:38,609
Anything.

762
00:39:38,678 --> 00:39:40,678
Thank you.

763
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,153
Director Vance.

764
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:51,488
Wow, nice.

765
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:53,123
That going on display?

766
00:39:53,192 --> 00:39:55,626
No, that's going in my pocket
for a rainy day.

767
00:39:55,695 --> 00:39:57,294
- Oh.
- What can I do for you, Jack?

768
00:39:57,363 --> 00:39:59,730
How you doing, Leon?

769
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:01,298
- I'm good.
- Really?

770
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:04,168
Harpoons can leave
a hell of a scar.

771
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,003
Really.

772
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:08,672
Really? Good.

773
00:40:08,741 --> 00:40:09,741
Anything else?

774
00:40:09,775 --> 00:40:11,675
I saw that Mallory's plea deal

775
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:13,243
went through.
You didn't block it.

776
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,523
But I didn't endorse it, either.

777
00:40:14,547 --> 00:40:17,581
Fair enough. Hey.

778
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,217
I know a few librarians,

779
00:40:20,286 --> 00:40:22,097
if you're ever looking
to get back in the game.

780
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:23,487
Eventually.

781
00:40:23,556 --> 00:40:24,822
Thanks, Jack.

782
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:40,938
That's great news.
I'll let them know.

783
00:40:42,408 --> 00:40:44,241
Well, that was
the Justice Department.

784
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:47,244
Deakin's plea was enough to get
the other four judges arrested.

785
00:40:47,313 --> 00:40:48,946
Judge Badass sang like a bird.

786
00:40:49,015 --> 00:40:51,181
I know he's a murderer,
but does anyone else want to go

787
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,751
bowl a few games before
that place gets shut down?

788
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:56,186
I don't think
his restoration skills

789
00:40:56,255 --> 00:40:58,922
are gonna translate
to cinder blocks so well.

790
00:40:58,991 --> 00:41:00,357
So?

791
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,427
Right.

792
00:41:03,496 --> 00:41:07,965
Anybody want to talk about it?

793
00:41:08,034 --> 00:41:10,601
If Deakin had anything
concrete against Gibbs,

794
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:14,238
he would've used the actual
justice system, not his own.

795
00:41:16,008 --> 00:41:18,942
Do you guys think that Gibbs
will want us to bring it up?

796
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:22,913
You know.

797
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:25,115
Pedro Hernandez.

798
00:41:25,184 --> 00:41:27,117
