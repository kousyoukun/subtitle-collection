1
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,210
I know,come on.

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,440
Sit down.

3
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:34,970
Why are you hiding?

4
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,000
'Cause we weren't invited,Lucas.

5
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,150
It's the after party.
It belongs to all of us.

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,750
An invitation would have been redundant.

7
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,560
It would have been polite.

8
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,760
Come on. They're all going
to be happy to see us.

9
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,220
They're never happy to see us at lunch.

10
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,890
Why would it be so different now?

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,120
Because.

12
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,810
- Come on.
- Okay.

13
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,160
Hey,guys. Look what we brought.

14
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,750
They don't look so happy.

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,920
Help. Help,help...

19
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,320
- I'm not even going to ask.
- Allow me.

20
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,090
What are you doing,Tony?

21
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,330
Best
deep-in-thought face.

22
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,200
I guess there's a first
time for everything.

23
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,020
Nailed it. All
right,strawdawg24,beat this one.

24
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,940
Yeah,baby.

25
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,060
Ibeatyou.com. The place to compete
online with anyone in anything.

26
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,030
Yeah,it's very fun. It's very addictive.

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,250
Look at this guy. Best air guitar.
Look at that guy. Best do The Hustle.

28
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,430
I mean,you name it,they got it.

29
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,880
- "The Hustle"?
- The Hustle.

30
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,660
Saturday Night Fever? Travolta.

31
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,560
You know.

32
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,060
What is the point?

33
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,730
What is the point of any
dance? It's about letting loose.

34
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,500
It's,you know,having a good time.

35
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,510
I meant the Web site,Tony.

36
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,840
It's fun.

37
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,710
It is amusement,light-hearted pleasure.

38
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,540
I know what you're doing.
I know how to have fun,Tony.

39
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,410
Really? Do tell.

40
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,590
The hustling and the deep-thinking
photos,those are all just,you know,child's play.

41
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,970
Tell him,McGee.

42
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,170
McGee?

43
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,100
Uh,I'm working on my
best psycho face here.

44
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,300
That's not bad,probie.

45
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,790
Just need to work it a
little bit at the eyebrow.

46
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,580
See what I'm saying? See how that reads?

47
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,380
- See that? That's what you
want. - Yeah,yeah,yeah-yeah...

48
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,470
Would you two like some
time alone together?

49
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,170
Uh,no,boss. We were just...

50
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,300
Acting like children.

51
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,590
You say that like it's a bad thing.

52
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,410
Got a dead petty officer
in the woods; let's go.

53
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,670
Check out the air guitarists yet?

54
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,980
I'm in third place right now.

55
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,230
Petty Officer Greg Collins. Twenty-six.

56
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,080
Worked as a boatswain's
mate on the USSShenandoah.

57
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,030
On 30-day leave.

58
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,980
Lives alone in Norfolk.

59
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,090
Gibbs. Found a blood
trail,goes this way.

60
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,650
Leads back to the car.

61
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,000
Run off the road.

62
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,460
You know that just by looking?

63
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,210
Listening,DiNozzo. The sheriff told me.

64
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,900
Gonna follow the blood trail.

65
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,160
Wait for me,Pocahontas.

66
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,160
Well,this fellow didn't come
here to roast marshmallows.

67
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,420
Blunt force trauma.

68
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,940
Glass fragment cuts on the exposed skin.

69
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,790
Seatbelt restraint contusions--
all consistent with a...

70
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,760
Car accident.

71
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,400
Stumbles in looking for help.

72
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,180
Yeah,well,he certainly need it.

73
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:16,750
However,what is strange is that
these minor abrasions were tended to,

74
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,210
whereas his most serious
injuries were not.

75
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,860
This explains it.

76
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,900
These wounds are older.

77
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,310
They show signs of primary hemostasis.

78
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,820
First stages of scab formation.

79
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,960
Ah,it appears our deceased
had an unfortunate accident

80
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,280
before he had his unfortunate accident.

81
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,050
Someone didn't know
how to parallel park.

82
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,740
I have always found it hard to park
when someone is shooting at you.

83
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,760
Found the slug in the
passenger headrest.

84
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,490
Missed its target,huh?

85
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,400
Got the job done.

86
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,720
Talk to me.

87
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,240
Well,it looks like Collins'
car was shot at,boss.

88
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,020
Several partial fingerprints on
the driver's side window here.

89
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,730
Time of crash?

90
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,500
Well,the kids didn't hear any gunshots
or the crash,so it must've been...

91
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,540
Wasn't a question,DiNozzo.

92
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,380
The clock on the dash is broken.

93
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,680
Right.

94
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,690
7:22 p.m.

95
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,140
Hour before the party started.

96
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,730
Shoe print. The victim's?

97
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,590
That's not a Chuck.

98
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,580
Collins was wearing Chuck
Taylor Converse All-Stars.

99
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,450
You know,basketball shoes. That's
not a Chuck. Somebody else was here.

100
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,060
- Passenger?
- Yeah.

101
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,110
Or shooter.

102
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,510
This is getting like a Greek tragedy.

103
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,910
Did you know that legend
has it that in 456 B.C.

104
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:07,210
a vulture mistook a man's bald head
for its prey and dropped a stone on it?

105
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,900
Killed him instantly.

106
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,420
Yeah,the unfortunate
fellow became known as...

107
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,220
The father of Greek tragedy.

108
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,230
I had no idea you were familiar
with the classics,Jethro.

109
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,090
Perhaps it's only the tragedies?

110
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,790
What do you got for me,Duck?

111
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:29,490
Well,like Aeschylus,our petty officer's
death is both tragic and unique.

112
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,570
He suffered two types of injury:
those sustained in the car crash

113
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,500
and those inflicted
on him prior to it,see?

114
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:43,250
This fist-shaped bruise on his forehead,the
gouges on his cheek by the broken jaw.

115
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,720
He was beaten.

116
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,120
Savagely.

117
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,650
And he fought back as well.

118
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,140
See,the knuckles on his
right hand are skinned raw.

119
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,780
However,Abby performed a DNA test on some skin
fragments I found under Collins' fingernails.

120
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,370
Presumably,they belong to his attacker.

121
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,690
Our brilliant forensic scientist has now
come up with something most interesting.

122
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,950
The same DNA on Collins' bandages.

123
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,110
Same person.

124
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,450
The hands that pummeled the petty
officer also bandaged his wounds.

125
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:23,800
Whoever did this,Jethro,is
both savage and a Samaritan.

126
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,080
Hey,McGee,do you have the crime scene
photos? I need to cue them up for Gibbs.

127
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,860
Tony was supposed to upload them.

128
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,970
Where is he?

129
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,840
Big Wong's. It's his turn for takeout.

130
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,940
Sothisis air guitaring?

131
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,710
Yeah,you know,you,uh,pretend
to play the guitar.

132
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,400
Why not actually play the guitar?

133
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,780
Well,because it is calledairguitaring?

134
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,510
Right. I got that part.

135
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,990
I still do not understand...

136
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,340
Ziva,photos. Plasma.

137
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,740
There are two sets of tire
tracks on the road near the crash.

138
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,190
Based on the vectoring of the skids,both
cars were traveling in the same direction.

139
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,380
Bullet through the back window.

140
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,600
I smell road rage.

141
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,280
And I smell Big Wong.

142
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,750
Collins swerves,rolls
down the embankment.

143
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,030
The other driver goes
down looking for him.

144
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,020
Finds a corpse and
bails,hit-and-run.

145
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,890
Shoot and run.

146
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,430
My God,Gibbs,I'm so sorry. I just...

147
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,280
Shooter could have known Collins.
Ran him off the road on purpose.

148
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,830
Well,we'll know soon enough.

149
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,070
Abby's running the prints from the
driver's side window through AFIS.

150
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,740
Boss,I've been monitoring
Collins' cell phone activity.

151
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,820
- He just received a call.
- From who?

152
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,190
Home security service.

153
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,700
Collin's alarm is going off.

154
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,620
I see you like going
through my photos,huh?

155
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,970
Yeah,I like reading.

156
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,630
Hemmingway,Dostoevsky--
guess what he wrote?

157
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,160
The Idiot.

158
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,310
Clear.

159
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,580
Clear inside.

160
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,590
But we got something.

161
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,940
Found it in a laundry basket.

162
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,750
Maybe the Laundromat
was out of quarters.

163
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,800
Looks like six,$700 there.

164
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,880
They forced the latch
on the back door open.

165
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,550
- Forgot the money.
- Gibbs.

166
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,480
Blood's dry. At least a day old.

167
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,510
Looks like the Tooth Fairy missed one.

168
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,330
A couple more here. Bag 'em.

169
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:55,080
Ah,damn. Neighbors.

170
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,130
Come on.

171
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,860
I'm Bruce Solomon. I,uh,I
live across the street.

172
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,820
I'm,uh,Adam Parker,the
duplex with the English ivy.

173
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,500
We,uh,we heard the alarm. It's
been going off for 46 minutes.

174
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,850
Um,we did a quick patrol.

175
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,680
No signs of any suspicious activity.

176
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,680
Let me guess,Neighborhood Watch.

177
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,300
Mm-hmm,is Greg okay?

178
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,390
Petty Officer Collins is dead.

179
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,210
- Car accident,last night.
- Oh,my God.

180
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,200
Was it on Route Ten?

181
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,760
'Cause we've petioned the city for
a turn lane there for a long time.

182
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,330
Collins was murdered. Run off the road.

183
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,340
You don't look surprised.

184
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,330
You have a lot of murders
here on Wisteria Lane?

185
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,770
Well,it's a,it's a very quiet
area,but ever since Greg moved in...

186
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:44,390
Not so quiet. There's
music,parties... lots of drinking.

187
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,590
Last week,it got completely out of
hand. There was this whole gang of them.

188
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,660
And then a fight broke out,but
nobody tried to break it up.

189
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,510
They were just standing
around cheering. It was weird.

190
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,540
- It reminded me of,um...
- Tyler Durden.

191
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,370
- Yeah,exactly.
- Who?

192
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,370
Ed Norton,Brad Pitt,Fight Club.

193
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,880
Sorry,Ziva,we don't
talk about fight club.

194
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:03,770
DiNozzo.

195
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,730
In your case,I'll make
an exception for you,boss.

196
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,030
Underground backyard brawls.

197
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,330
No rules,no gloves,no mercy.

198
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,700
There's a huge black market
for underground fight videos.

199
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,320
It starts in the backyard...

200
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,630
Ends on the back road.

201
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,630
No match on the partials
from Collins' car.

202
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,460
And this is the best of them.

203
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,110
Partials are a little tougher.

204
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,930
But that hasn't stopped
me,nor will it ever,

205
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,840
because I am the Energizer
Bunny of forensic science.

206
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,810
I never sleep and I never give up.

207
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,440
Help,I'm losing power.

208
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,010
Shoe print.

209
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,010
We couldn't match it to any known brand.

210
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,590
Even Tony didn't recognize it.

211
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,340
You know his shoe collection.

212
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,050
We think the shoe was custom-made.

213
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,380
And very pricey.

214
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,080
Sweet. I heart the VODD.

215
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,710
Virginia Offender DNA Databank.

216
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,770
Abby ran the DNA from Collins'
bandages and hit the jackpot.

217
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,220
Name?

218
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,930
Patience,fearless leader,I'm
just uploading the data right now.

219
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,080
And the winner is...

220
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,040
Sam Bennett. Civilian.

221
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,980
Rap sheet includes petty
theft,B and E,disorderly conduct.

222
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,770
Doesn't appear to have
a permanent address.

223
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,710
Work?

224
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,680
Well,shiver me timbers,looks like Bennett
is part of a salvage crew on a ship.

225
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:30,360
Navy frigate,boss. USSRubicon.

226
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,060
- You know how a ship is decommissioned?
- Yep.

227
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,880
First the military removes all
the,uh,classified material--

228
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,890
the,uh,electronics,weapons.

229
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,850
Yes. I know.

230
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,210
The hull of the ship
is,uh,is striped for scrap.

231
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,780
And if a ship has a history,it may
be turned into a maritime museum.

232
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,650
You guys the Navy cops?

233
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,460
Yeah,my seahorse is
double-parked outside.

234
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,320
You ought to see the lights.
We're here to talk to Sam Bennett.

235
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,080
- Not here.
- Come again?

236
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,040
Bennett-- he's
not on the ship.

237
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,760
Are you the foreman that I spoke to
earlier,said that Sam Bennett was here?

238
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,370
Yeah. Was.

239
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,080
He clocked in earlier today.

240
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,870
He's wanted in connection with a murder.

241
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,810
We're here to speak with him.

242
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,530
Look,I can't find him,okay?

243
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,310
I had my crew look everywhere.

244
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,790
After I told him you were coming,he told
the guys he was going out for a smoke.

245
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,390
He never came back.

246
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,130
Do you know where he's staying?

247
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,820
I don't really ask a lot of questions.

248
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,660
You know,these-these salvage
guys,they're not exactly...

249
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,880
Employee of the Month
material. We got it.

250
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,680
Here you go. Sorry.

251
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:50,240
Bennett's on the run.

252
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:55,880
I need a BOLO. Sam
Bennett. Caucasian male,23.

253
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,600
Go,McGee.

254
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,210
Well,Bennett doesn't have a cell.
No e-mail. No driver's license.

255
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,970
- No living relatives.
- Not even a library card.

256
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,280
No. Bennett. As in Tony.

257
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,550

B-E-N-E-T-T.

258
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,270
He's gotta exist
somewhere. Keep looking.

259
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,000
With an "S."

260
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,340
- Sam?
- Yeah.

261
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,860
As in Sam I am. Sam,play it
again,Sam. Sam with an "S."

262
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,520
- All right,got it.
- Oh,my gosh.

263
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,460
He's 23,six foot,three,210 pounds.

264
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:26,040
Light brown hair,blue eyes,and a
barbwire tattoo on his left bicep.

265
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,180
He was last seen...

266
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,540
Standing right behind you,DiNozzo.

267
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,280
I love it when they turn themselves in.

268
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,420
You want to tell me about Greg?

269
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,330
Stood by me when everyone else bailed.

270
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,030
Taught me how to look out for
something else besides just myself.

271
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,350
Four-oh sailor.

272
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,060
He was my best friend.

273
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,010
I made a lot of mistakes.

274
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,520
And he-he turned my life around.

275
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,240
I owe him everything.

276
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,650
He got me the welding gig on the ship.

277
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,260
I'm-I'm good with my hands.

278
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,370
Greg's face said the same thing.

279
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,560
Tell me about the fights.

280
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,160
Not supposed to.

281
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,110
- Fight club.
- Told you.

282
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,600
You should look into it sometime.

283
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,820
I'm sure you'd enjoy yourself.

284
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,340
I remember my first fight.

285
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,460
I was eight. Shmuel Rubinstein.

286
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,280
Sounds like a real stud.

287
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,440
One punch and it was over.

288
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,820
What did poor Shmuel do to
deserve the wrath of Ziva?

289
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,070
He said he liked me.

290
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,730
I keep my promises. He was my buddy.

291
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,180
Your buddy's dead.

292
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,760
The locations move around a lot.

293
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,200
Last week the fights
went down at Greg's place.

294
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,990
He cleaned up,won some cash.

295
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,820
And the fights yesterday?

296
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,410
Vacant lot in Chesapeake.

297
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:38,170
So you and,uh,Collins--
you fought each other.

298
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,230
We didn't want to,but
we didn't have a choice.

299
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,920
The-The fights are random draw.

300
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,890
When it was over,I-I fixed
him up as best I could.

301
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,260
Then I killed him.

302
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,610
Oh,wait a minute,that was way too easy.

303
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,970
He didn't even get the Gibbs glare.

304
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,190
- Could be covering for someone.
- ...with my own bare hands.

305
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,660
When my foreman told me that you guys
were looking for me,I-I freaked out.

306
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,800
But I'm done running.

307
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:18,100
I owe it to Greg to do the right
thing and to turn myself in.

308
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,430
You didn't kill him.

309
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,340
He's dead because of me.

310
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,990
You in the car with him?

311
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:33,050
No,his-his eyes were-were practically
swollen shut from the fight.

312
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,190
I told him that it wasn't safe to drive.

313
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,030
He wouldn't listen.

314
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:44,000
I-I tried to stop him,and he
just got in his car and he left.

315
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,670
Well,20 minutes
later,somebody shot up his car.

316
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,810
What?

317
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,480
Crash wasn't an accident.

318
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,580
Wait,somebody killed him?

319
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,790
Sit down.

320
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,340
Who shot at him?

321
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,760
Any fighters have a grudge?

322
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,100
I don't know. I-I
don't know any of them.

323
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:11,520
Greg would just bring me in to make some
extra dough when I was tight for cash.

324
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,800
Names.

325
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,300
Reaper,Wild Dog...

326
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,660
No,their real names.

327
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,500
I don't know their real names.

328
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,800
But when I find out who did this
to Greg,they're gonna know mine.

329
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:26,050
And that is the last thing
they're ever gonna know!

330
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,150
Think one of those backyard
brawlers whacked Collins?

331
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,490
Well,I doubt they're the
most stable kind of people.

332
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:38,910
Big,hairy,sweaty Neanderthals pounding
the pudding out of each other for giggles?

333
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,240
For green.

334
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,580
One of those fighters
make a lot of money.

335
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,050
I'd pay to see the right bout.

336
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:48,480
Like Leroy Jethro Gibbs versus...

337
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,190
Ziva.

338
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,560
Oh,McGee,I was thinking like Terminator.

339
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,670
Which model?
T-X? T-1000?

340
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,280
All of them. Gibbs terminates.

341
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,770
All right,how about
Gibbs versus Godzilla.

342
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,860
King of the Monsters... toast.

343
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,660
Mothra.

344
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,110
Wingless in a nanosecond.

345
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,870
Come on,McGee,give me something fierce.

346
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,480
- Boss man's got mad skills.
- All right.

347
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,000
Ooh,okay. Gibbs versus...

348
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,200
Gibbs.

349
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,300
Oh,that's good.

350
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:25,010
Okay,so,um,evil twin or a clone?

351
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,570
Gibbs! Good timing. I
have something to show you.

352
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,310
Okay,we found three layers of paint
on the left rear quarter panel--

353
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,480
silver and then brown,and then
silver again over the original gold.

354
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,610
This is old-fashioned bumper cars.

355
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:45,880
By using the tire skids on the road,we
were able to recreate the accident.

356
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,580
The first layer of paint is silver.

357
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,450
It came from the evil,mystery car. Bam!

358
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,510
It rams Collins' car. He swerves.

359
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,980
Pumps the brakes,and he leaves
this tire skid on the road.

360
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,260
Then Collins' was shot at.

361
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,060
That's the,uh,bullet
hole in the back window.

362
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,090
And there's two more slugs in the car.

363
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,690
So,uh,Collins hits the gas-- he burns
rubber,and then fishtails into a barricade.

364
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,490
Bam! A brown barricade!

365
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,960
The second layer of paint.

366
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,810
Then another-- bam! as the evil
car hits Collins' car one last time,

367
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,520
sends him off the road and giving
us the final layer of silver paint,

368
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,710
and confirming its evilosity.

369
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,690
The silver base coat-- it
contains three properties:

370
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,490
methyl ethyl ketone,xylene
and titanium dioxide.

371
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,110
Now,the first two are common solvents.

372
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,740
Titanium dioxide,not so much.

373
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,150
- So,we should be able to trace it.
- Then do it.

374
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,460
- Hey,boss.
- Yes,McGee?

375
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,790
Have you ever lost a fight?

376
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,020
Not sure I even ever won one.

377
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,760
Definitely a Gibbs clone.

378
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,300
I'm cross-referencing the paint
against a database of automakers.

379
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,370
Got a match here,Maserati
Quattroporte,2009.

380
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,870
- Need some serious coin to roll in one of those.
- Find it.

381
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,970
Several registered in the tristate area.

382
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,640
Two belong to Muhammad Al-Qazir.

383
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,600
Unfortunately,his are
both Baltic Black Metallic.

384
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,700
Argenta Silver.

385
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,930
Got it. Tabitha Summers.

386
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,950
- Looks rich.
- Uh,is rich.

387
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,560
Father died three years ago,left
her the family's import business.

388
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,230
- She's worth over 50 million.
- Bring her in.

389
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,500
I'll send the limo.

390
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:38,000
- You're on.
- You owe me.

391
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,140
Hello.

392
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,170
Afternoon.

393
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:48,530
Dale Kapp,Mrs. Summers'
personal attorney.

394
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,810
Can we get this over with?

395
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,320
Sure. This way,please.

396
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:01,370
That is what they call the
eye of the cougar,probie.

397
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,090
Isn't she married?

398
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,150
She's a t jungle cat. The
cougar is always on the hunt.

399
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,650
It's the nature of the beast.

400
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,020
I always thought
cougars like young guys.

401
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,210
This is extremely
mortifying for my client.

402
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,780
And while she has nothing to hide,she
certainly wouldn't want it implied in the press

403
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,590
that she has anything to do
with your ongoing investigation.

404
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,720
You recognize him?

405
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,420
No.

406
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,710
Do you recognize this?

407
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,920
Mm,my car. Or one of them.

408
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,320
It was involved in a
hit-and-run accident last night.

409
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:52,680
But my husband and I were both in
for the evening getting massages.

410
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,790
Then we'll need to talk to your husband.

411
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,430
You are.

412
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,360
Dale is my current husband.

413
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,560
Current?

414
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,980
right. Uh,husband number...

415
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,080
three.

416
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,150
Four.

417
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,020
Dale handled my previous divorce.

418
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,200
Mazel tov.

419
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,430
We never left our home.

420
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,220
Car drove itself then?

421
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,810
Look,we have a dozen house employees who
could have possibly accessed the motor pool--

422
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,760
cooks,gardeners,pool staff.

423
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,510
Names?

424
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,460
And we need to see the car.

425
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,910
Oh,I'm sorry. It's being taken this
afternoon to our home in Nantucket.

426
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,470
Actually,it's going to
the Hamptons cottage.

427
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,710
I thought I told you we're
spending Christmas in Nantucket?

428
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,190
Don't you ever listen?

429
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,660
Still,we need to see the car.

430
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,220
I'll take care of it.

431
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,960
Are we done with these people?

432
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,650
Any other questions for my client?

433
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,330
Need a DNA sample.

434
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,930
Is my wife being charged,Agent Gibbs?

435
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,750
Not yet.

436
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,350
Then we're leaving. Thank you.

437
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:07,280
Oh,the old
fingerprint-off-the-glass trick.

438
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,940
- Who needs DNA.
- Abby?

439
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,900
You're right. I need
DNA. It's my lifeblood.

440
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,740
Okay,well,doesn't match
the partial from the car.

441
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:16,940
It wasn't Tabitha.

442
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,910
I will start rounding up their
house employees for questioning.

443
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:24,420
I thought you said her
prints didn't match.

444
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,370
That's not from Tabitha's glass.

445
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,980
It's from her husband's,Dale Kapp.

446
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,080
Get him back here.

447
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,180
He's probably already
off the base by now.

448
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,330
I'll put out a BOLO.

449
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,380
Cell phone.

450
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,890
I'm already triangulating
for a signal,Gibbs.

451
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,380
You've got to be faster
than that. Got him.

452
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:43,010
He's on the phone right
now,and he's still on the base.

453
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,370
As a matter of fact,he is
right in front of the building.

454
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,160
That's weird. Looks like
he's driving into the lobby.

455
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,210
DiNozzo,front
gate-- shut it down.

456
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,410
Who are we stopping?

457
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,620
Everyone,I guess.

458
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,610
This is Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

459
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,260
We need to shut down the
front gate. Lock it down.

460
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,990
Where's your husband?

461
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:07,280
I don't know. Spending his
last few hours as a married man?

462
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:11,900
He went to get the car,and
then just drove off. Left me.

463
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,490
First Bennett runs,and now Kapp.

464
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,710
Maybe the only thing Kapp's
running from is his wife.

465
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,050
Dangerous.

466
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,500
You know how fast a cougar can run?

467
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,130
Not fast enough. She
could not catch his car.

468
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,080
Kapp must have known we were closing in.

469
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,510
He's running for a reason.

470
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,970
But she has no idea why.

471
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,830
Says she has never heard of Collins.

472
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,730
Well,Kapp obviously has.

473
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,180
Oh,hey,boss. We got his
laptop. It's down with Abby.

474
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,040
Spoke with the Summers' masseuse.

475
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,890
Kapp cancelled his shiatsu.

476
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,630
When he was supposedly at home,

477
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:52,200
a traffic camera a mile away shows him
running a red light in the Maserati.

478
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,520
It time-stamped yesterday,7:16 p.m.

479
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,110
six minutes before Collins
was run off the road.

480
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:01,100
That's gonna be 400 bucks for a traffic
violation,and 50 years for murder.

481
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,660
Motive?

482
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,210
Motive. There's a question.

483
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,970
We cross-referenced Kapp and Collins'
cell phone records and credit cards.

484
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,100
We got nothing.

485
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,550
No apparent connection.

486
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,650
Collins' C.O.?

487
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,550
Never heard of Kapp. Neither
have any of Collins' shipmates.

488
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,060
Gold-digging,society lawyer and a squid who
spends his spare time beating guys to a pulp.

489
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,450
Next,on an all-newMaury.

490
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,870
- Yeah,Abs.
- Gibbs,can you come to the lab?

491
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,910
Mm-hmm,be right down. McGee. Find him.

492
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,860
I'm checking to see if
there's any hits on the BOLO.

493
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,990
Still nothing.

494
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:38,830
But my current rank in
the air guitar competition

495
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,070
is up with a bullet to second.

496
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:45,010
Oh,you must be so proud.

497
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,970
- You're jealous.
- Because you can air guitar?

498
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,900
Because you can't.

499
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:52,000
Tony,I've told you. I
like to have fun in more...

500
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,000
adult ways.

501
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,850
- Reading.
- Yes. Reading.

502
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,200
Look,everybody enjoys a good book,

503
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:06,000
but don't you ever have the
urge to just act a little...

504
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,330
Childish?

505
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,620
Silly. Stupid. Brainless.

506
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,620
- Like you?
- Exactly.

507
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,900
Tony,you anI come from two
totally different places.

508
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,130
In my world,you grow up... fast.

509
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,440
- You have no choice.
- Now you do.

510
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,510
I found a series of encrypted files in
a hidden partition in Kapp's computer.

511
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,500
A lot of e-mails and
chat room conversations.

512
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,470
Over 20 in the last month,all
from the same screen name.

513
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,300
- J-Digg19.
- Plasma.

514
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,710
Decrypt it.

515
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,080
Uh,we already did,boss. It's...

516
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,390
Well,you know,it's a chat room.

517
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,020
It's IM-speak.

518
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,600
You wouldn't know.

519
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,800
It starts off with,"Hey,how are
you today?" "Fine,thank you."

520
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:56,060
Gets interesting further down.

521
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,730
He wants to know what she's wearing.

522
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,320
Says he wants to take
her shopping for lingerie.

523
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,620
- Then he says...
- Yeah. Yeah,McGee,I get the picture.

524
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,220
- Who is she?
- Not his wife.

525
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,450
There's an embedded hyperlink.

526
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,310
He's chatting with a Jodi,and
here's her MySpace page.

527
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,870
Blink,McGee. It's just a girl.

528
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,120
- What? I'm just...
- Gawking?

529
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,010
Uh,no. Pinging.

530
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:22,560
Boss,by pinging the site's DNS cache,we can
see what computer last logged in to Jodi's page.

531
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:26,070
And get the IP address,which
is registered to...

532
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:29,130
205 Wilcox.

533
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,820
Going by yourself,boss? Need,uh,backup?

534
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,380
Reminds me of my first
apartment in college.

535
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,250
You can almost smell the Ikea.

536
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:46,020
Come on in! Door's open.

537
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,640
NCIS.

538
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:53,040
I'll be right there.
Grab a drink if you want.

539
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,830
Think she was expecting someone.

540
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,140
Want a drink? Just kidding.

541
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,090
Federal agents. We
need to talk with you.

542
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,280
Did I mention my roommate
went home for the weekend?

543
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,720
Nice timing,huh?

544
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,130
We're federal agents. We'd like
to ask you a few questions,ma'am.

545
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,460
You know what? I got an idea.

546
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:19,750
Why don't you strip down and
jump in the shower with me?

547
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,700
- Hey,DiNozzo!
- No,it's not what you think. Check it out,boss.

548
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,980
Lipstick camera.

549
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:31,050
Oh,we're being watched.

550
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,030
There's another one.

551
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,270
Federal agents. We're coming in.

552
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,200
Peekaboo.

553
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,220
You see,things are not what they seem.

554
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,150
Jodi's voice was precorded.

555
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,690
Maybe it's one of those
voice-activated,motion-activated,sensor thing-a-ma-jobs.

556
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,240
You know,gets her talking.

557
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,650
Where's McGeek when you need him?

558
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,450
Oh,I got another one.

559
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,500
It's getting kind of lonely in here.

560
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:26,350
How long you gonna keep me waiting?

561
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,780
Careful,boss,it might be rigged.

562
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,220
Or not.

563
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,840
Like a sort of a computer
storage megagiga thingy.

564
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,500
We're not being watched.

565
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,510
We're being recorded.

566
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,270
It's kind of like that TV
show,To Catch a Predator.

567
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,220
Yeah. Only,this is more
like To Catch a Sucka.

568
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,550
Here's how the scam works.

569
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,080
Jodi hangs out in chat rooms,looking
for unhappily married men.

570
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,530
Unfortunately,when the men
show up,there is no Jodi.

571
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,650
- Just video cameras.
- Yup. Recording everything.

572
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,850
Then the mark gets e-mailed a threat,

573
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,180
saying if they want that videotape
to disappear,they got to pay.

574
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,220
Ten Gs.

575
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,280
I'm trying to find the
owner of the Web site now.

576
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,710
Lot of cash for Joe Blow.

577
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,510
Blackmailer isn't targeting Joe Blow.

578
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,500
No. He is targeting men with rich wives.

579
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,210
Suckas like this guy.

580
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,730
Dale Kapp.

581
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,150
If he gets naked,I'm out of here.

582
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,910
Video footage on this server
going back almost two years.

583
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,070
Well,wherever Jodi
is,she's making a killing.

584
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,320
Oh,she isn't anywhere.
She doesn't exist.

585
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,670
I ran facial-recognition
software on Jodi.

586
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:46,490
I traced the face back to a
modeling Web site in the Ukraine.

587
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,620
The image was stolen.

588
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:51,610
So,who's the man behind
the shower curtain?

589
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:55,250
And we have a winner. The e-mail
account is registered to...

590
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,950
Petty Officer Collins.

591
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,860
Got our motive.

592
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,220
Kapp didn't want to
pay,and killed Collins.

593
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,120
BOLO came back on Kapp's Town Car.

594
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,230
It is parked outside Collins' house.

595
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,090
Kapp's ride.

596
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,210
Why did he come here?

597
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,820
Probably looking for any backup copies
Collins had of the incriminating footage.

598
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,980
Hood's still warm.

599
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,420
Boss,I got the front.

600
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,620
Looks like we missed another fight.

601
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,550
Somebody just murdered our murder.

602
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,460
Our man has been
murdered,our killer killed.

603
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,130
Kapp capped.

604
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,910
He has a possible fractured skull.

605
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,510
And there's multiple
contusions to his head.

606
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,580
Beaten to death?

607
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,820
The usual disclaimer until
I do a thorough examination.

608
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,820
Fists?

609
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,080
Something harder.

610
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,610
With an edge.

611
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,550
Boss.

612
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,640
Like a length of wood.

613
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,190
Got a witness,boss.

614
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,810
There was someone
here today after lunch.

615
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:49,240
One of Collins' friends:
big guy with fair hair.

616
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,010
I got a really good look at him.

617
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,970
Sam Bennett.

618
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,770
Got a BOLO out in every
homeless shelter in Norfolk,boss.

619
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,670
Coordinate with Norfolk PD.

620
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,660
Already done.

621
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,060
Bennett must have known
something we didn't.

622
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,520
Found out Kapp was the killer.

623
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,150
He did say he would get payback.

624
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,360
And he did. Beat Kapp to a pulp
with a 2x4 after we released him.

625
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,720
Where is he going?

626
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,800
Well,doesn't have any family. No money.

627
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:18,670
BOLO doesn't come back
soon,he's gonna disappear.

628
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,280
You need to unplug
yourself from the Matrix,

629
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,190
do some old-school sleuthing,Pinkerton.

630
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,150
It's all about asking
the right question.

631
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,760
Well,ask away,DiNozzo.

632
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:30,880
Why did Kapp rabbit out of
here,leaving his wife behind?

633
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,600
Why did he go straight
to Collins' house?

634
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,160
And how did Bennett
know to find him there?

635
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,250
He didn't find him. He lured him.

636
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,850
Easy enough-- all Bennett
had to do was phone Kapp,

637
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:43,810
tell him he had a couple of photos
of him showing up to Jodi's apartment.

638
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,750
Running Kapp's cell phone records.

639
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,240
There.

640
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:54,450
Got a call after he left
us and dumped his wife.

641
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,840
Bennett.

642
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,840
Tracing the call.

643
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,500
Came from Collins' house.
Bennett must have been there.

644
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,680
Left before we arrived.

645
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:06,330
Got it. Collins' phone records.

646
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,350
Five calls to his house from
a pay phone located at...

647
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,330
Western Dock.

648
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,950
Where the USSRubicon
is being decommissioned.

649
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,510
Gear up.

650
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,580
How's that for old-school slothing?

651
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,370
Sleuthing--
having fun yet?

652
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,650
No one home.

653
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,790
Salvage guys have called it a day.

654
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,390
Hey,keep it down.

655
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,560
Sorry.

656
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,220
Lost the lights.

657
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,520
Knows we're here.

658
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:04,550
Found Bennett's crash pad,boss.

659
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:14,240
Why does it always have
to be rats and boats?

660
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,140
McGee,heading your way.

661
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,870
Federal agent--
stay where you are.

662
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,920
Boss,C-deck, heading towards the bow.

663
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,390
Status,McGee.

664
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,610
McGee.

665
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,770
Anybody got eyes on McGee?

666
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,740
Negative.

667
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,830
No sign of him,boss.

668
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,460
Got him.

669
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,370
Way to go,McGee.

670
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,550
Taking down the fight club
champ. I'm almost impressed.

671
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:22,940
Well,I would be,too, except he fell over and
hit his head while he was trying to get away.

672
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,380
You killed him. You killed Kapp.

673
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:29,980
No.

674
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:33,080
You beat him to death with a
lump of wood, not your fists.

675
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,300
No.

676
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,980
Perhaps not the fighter
you think you are.

677
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,380
It wasn't me. It wasn't.

678
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,280
McGee,I'm busy.

679
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,700
If I find anything,you
will be the second to know.

680
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,640
I'm up to my choker collar in dried blood
and partial fingerprints and wood splinters.

681
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,390
Gibbs wants anything I can
find to pressure Bennett.

682
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,000
Then,why are you
running a WHO-IS search?

683
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:06,250
I found some anomalies in the
extortion e-mails Kapp received.

684
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,780
I'm trying to track down the
source of a header mismatch.

685
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:13,670
McGee. I got a ding.

686
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,720
Now,that's a ding.

687
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,390
That's not a ding. That's a leech.

688
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,120
- I told you, it wasn't me.
- Boss...

689
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:38,310
You told Agent Gibbs you would kill whoever was
responsible for Petty Officer Collins' death.

690
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,580
When you found out it was Kapp,
you called him from Collins' house.

691
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,890
I wasn't at the house.

692
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,200
- Yes,you were.
- No,I wasn't.

693
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,890
We have a witness who saw you there.

694
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:56,250
I didn't do it.

695
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,570
Do you know what a lineup is,Sam?

696
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,850
All right,thank you.

697
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,800
Hey,thanks for coming, Mr. Parker.

698
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,780
Just doing my civic duty, Agent Gibbs.

699
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:31,640
That's him. That's the man I saw.

700
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:42,100
That's him-- that's the guy,
the one I saw at Greg's house.

701
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,580
What is this?

702
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,020
Well,you've just been
identified by an eyewitness

703
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,840
who saw you beat Dale Kapp
to death this afternoon.

704
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,780
You believe him?

705
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,750
No,no,not just him.

706
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:58,290
Collins' Wi-Fi signal
wasn't password-protected.

707
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:01,640
As a result,anyone
could use it,and you did.

708
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,670
Called leeching.

709
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,470
If they traced the sender, they would
have ended up at Collins' house,not yours.

710
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,070
You were the leech.

711
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:12,650
Guess Kapp didn't want to
pay up, came looking for you.

712
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,790
Found Collins.

713
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,470
I'm not saying anything.

714
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:18,270
Nah... You don't have to.

715
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,730
We got enough on you anyway.

716
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,800
You can shut it off.

717
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:40,480
I was gonna stay at Greg's house.

718
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,570
Look after his stuff, you know?

719
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,710
I was in the bedroom...

720
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:52,130
and I heard the back
door open, so I hid.

721
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,260
Didn't want to get in trouble.

722
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:58,270
It was that
guy-- Parker.

723
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,410
Used the phone,made a call.

724
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,590
The man that killed Greg.

725
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,780
Pay up or else.

726
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,030
So,I waited.

727
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,950
I wanted to see who he was.

728
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:21,080
And then,when he got there, Parker
hit him with a piece of wood.

729
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,150
And hit him. And...

730
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,090
I just stood there...

731
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,980
watching from the
window, and I didn't...

732
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,070
I didn't stop him.

733
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,660
Because I wanted him dead,too.

734
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:03,060
Midnight screening ofGoodfellastonight
at the multiplex-- you want to come?

735
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:06,420
Uh,no,not tonight.

736
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,990
All right,enjoy the book.
