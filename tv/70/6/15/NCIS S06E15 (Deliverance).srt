1
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,800
You want to make a statement?

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,730
- You want to gangsta up, homie?
- Yeah

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,520
You got to go bold, all right?
Double action old school

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,370
It's sweet, it's simple, accurate
never jams Here we go, give it a try

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,980
- Where? - I don't know-
just-just shoot the pipe

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,280
Nice shot

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,590
What else you got?

8
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,080
All right, got the homie's
best friend here, all right?

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,450
It's a nine mill, it's
Beretta it's Italian

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,340
All right, it's 15
plus one in the snout

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,250
I'll throw in a box of
hollow point hot loads

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,110
Trust me, your stuff
will be safe, okay?

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,210
Here, here we go

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,600
Bad boy is tight!

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,800
You ain't seen the
baddest boy yet, all right?

16
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,110
Sweet mother of God
The pagans shall quake

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,480
It's a Tech 9 It's
top of the line

18
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,650
Fully automatic

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,040
You can empty the clip
in four seconds flat

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,760
- Are you man enough for this?
- Yeah

21
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,640
- Yeah?
- Yeah

22
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,970
Yeah, all right, give it
a shot, give it a ride

23
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,960
- You like that?
- Yeah

24
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,100
- You're looking taller already, buddy
- Yeah!

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,970
Let's get the hell out of
here! Let's go! Let's go!

26
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,880
Miss anything, McLovin?

27
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,360
Just this It's from a woman
named Melinda She had to postpone

28
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,340
Postpone what?

29
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,860
I don't know Figured
that you'd figure it out

30
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,340
How did she sound?

31
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,540
I ask the question, you give
the answer How did she sound?

32
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,020
- I don't know, Tony
- You don't know

33
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,630
Well, why don't you try using
your words, Mr Gem City?

34
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,300
Devastated? Despondent?

35
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,950
Delighted

36
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,200
All right What's
her number, McDetail?

37
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,230
She didn't leave one

38
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,520
It's customary to get a name, a
number and a complete message

39
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,100
This is not a complete message
This is a complete mess

40
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,550
Melinda

41
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,360
How many Melindas do
you have in that thing?

42
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,900
I don't know It could have been
the girl I talked to at the gym

43
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,990
You don't go to the gym

44
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,230
Maybe it was the girl I
talked to at the dog park

45
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,850
You don't have a dog

46
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,476
Oh, it could have been that girl I met
at the concession stand

47
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,053
While my date was in the bathroom

48
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:00,300
You need a secretary

49
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,290
Or a therapist

50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,430
Or both

51
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,460
Shots fired in Liberty
Heights Saddle it up

52
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,320
If we were called every time shots
were fired at Liberty Heights

53
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,390
Yeah, Well, Metro responded
They found a dead Marine

54
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,980
Victim is Private First
Class Emilio Salazar

55
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,640
Joined the Marines four months ago

56
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,660
Scheduled for deployment next week

57
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,560
Ducky?

58
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,550
Stuck in traffic Should
be here in about 20 minutes

59
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,020
Nine millimeter shells
Possibly two guns

60
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,583
And based on the level
of penetration on that wall

61
00:03:29,618 --> 00:03:32,101
I would say 357

62
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,210
No shells, which means a revolver

63
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,550
One shooter, three weapons

64
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,600
There's two sets of footprints

65
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,090
Shooter could have had a spotter

66
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,410
- Or a lookout
- Or a witness

67
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,700
Hey, DiNozzo

68
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,530
McGee

69
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,220
New Marine regulations
don't allow for exposed ink

70
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,310
He had his tat removed, laser

71
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,500
Looks
like- "P "

72
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,290
It looks like this

73
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,910
PCS

74
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,240
All right, I'll check
with Metro's gang unit

75
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,680
Bullets hit the skylight

76
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,000
killing our Marine

77
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,540
Sending him on a very
short bungee plunge

78
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,910
But why shoot your
hostage from down here?

79
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,550
Maybe they were sending a message

80
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,730
The kind McGee takes-
cryptic, hard to decipher

81
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,210
Blood

82
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,260
This blood is dried

83
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,140
But Metro made their "shots
fired" call less than an hour ago

84
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,950
Looks like the West
just got a bit wilder

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,220
Cuffs, boss

86
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,890
Skin, blood

87
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,330
This guy was strapped
up here for a while

88
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,670
That's why prefer
the fur handcuffs

89
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,570
Not really, boss That's for her

90
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,820
I don't wear the cuffs

91
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,280
Someone was trying
to send a message

92
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,680
Written in blood

93
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,580
Phone number?

94
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,100
Not a phone number

95
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,920
I don't know what the "G"
stands for, but it's nine digits

96
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,800
Could be a military
service number I'll run it

97
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,340
You don't have to

98
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,520
It's mine

99
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,850
Where is he?

100
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,650
Um, I'm not exactly sure, Director

101
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,310
Tell him I need to see him

102
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,510
I will give him the message

103
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,610
And the nature of the message

104
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,900
I'll include who it's
from, and the number

105
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,370
Why would anyone leave Gibbs' Marine
service number on a rooftop crime scene

106
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,990
Agent Gibbs' desk

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,970
No, he's not here

108
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,110
But I'd be happy to
take a detailed message

109
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,650
Flight arrives at 2:30

110
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,760
Can I take a name
or a return number?

111
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,710
Oh, okay I will

112
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,350
A name and a number

113
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,610
Enough, okay? I understand

114
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,040
I am sorry, but what
do you want me to do?

115
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,517
You want me to sort through
the database

116
00:06:05,552 --> 00:06:07,801
Of every call that came into
the switchboard this morning

117
00:06:07,836 --> 00:06:11,530
And match incoming call to your desk
phone using a date and a time stamp?

118
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,030
Yeah, actually That'd
be great Thanks

119
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,760
Oh, hey, boss, got two messages for
you, actually, right there Sorry

120
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,680
Director Vance wants you to
call him back ASAP, and the, uh

121
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,820
the other is, uh And then
there's-there's that one

122
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,220
Um, it says that the flight arrives
at 2:30 It's from M Street Travel

123
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,500
I assume that's a travel agent

124
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,520
Didn't say where the flight was
from or who the passenger was 

125
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,410
But if you want to share
that, you can feel

126
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,950
Dead Marine?

127
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,480
PFC Emilio Salazar Service record

128
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,820
18-year-old Completed basic training
at Parris Island two months ago

129
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,850
And was stationed at Quantico

130
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,540
Had more than a service record

131
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,480
Criminal record goes back
to 2003, when Emilio was 12

132
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,920
All juvenile offenses
All gang-related

133
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,430
Gang tattoos

134
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,870
Or Pecados Capitales

135
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,880
Capital Fish?

136
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,430
Deadly Sins, you
idiot Fish is pescado

137
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,720
Don't scoff at me

138
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,270
Lots of gangs are
named after deadly fish

139
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,800
There's the Sharks, there's
the Barracudas

140
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,830
Rumble Fish

141
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,440
These guys are also
known as the PCs

142
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,170
Sounds like your kind
of gang, McMotherboard

143
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,690
Kid lives through six years in a gang
can't survive four months as a Marine

144
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,320
Maybe someone didn't want
him to leave the gang?

145
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,550
Maybe a rival gang killed him?

146
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,060
Though that wouldn't explain
your service number, boss

147
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,850
Focus on tracking the killer

148
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,780
And what about the other person
who may have been held there?

149
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,820
Find the shooter

150
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,750
Vance wanted to call him ASAP, boss

151
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,400
Heard you the first time, DiNozzo

152
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,430
Private Jackson, do not shut your
eyes when you squeeze the trigger!

153
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,920
Eyes off the toys, David
We didn't come here to play

154
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,370
I have not been to
the range in days

155
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,360
No talking on the range, please

156
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,425
Well, that's going to be a real
problem, Staff Sergeant Medina

157
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,438
'Cause I'm real talky
and I have a badge

158
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,240
Is there somewhere we can talk?

159
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,550
Cease fire! Cease fire!
Clear and lock 'em! Stand by!

160
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,200
Thank you

161
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,980
A man in your unit
was killed last night

162
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,650
- How'd it happen?
- Firefight He lost

163
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,410
- Someone shot him?
- Several times

164
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,600
You know who did it?

165
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,620
If we did, we would not be here

166
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,140
Thought you could help

167
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,430
Any way I can

168
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,800
He was killed in the
neighborhood where he grew up

169
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,840
He ever talk about his
past? Gangs, trouble?

170
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,120
All the time He was
trying to escape it

171
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,720
So you knew he had a record
before he joined the Marines?

172
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,280
Some of these kids grew up in a jungle

173
00:08:48,315 --> 00:08:50,626
A lot more dangerous than the desert
we're sending them to, you know?

174
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:54,540
Salazar ever drop names, gang
affiliations, enemies?

175
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,920
Nothing specific

176
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,910
He had troubles like any kid
who runs in gang circles

177
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:01,745
But he didn't name anybody

178
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,240
If you can think of
anything, let me know

179
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,150
- Berettas- nine
millimeter - Feel free

180
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,290
- Do you mind?
- Not at all, ma'am

181
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,490
Do your best

182
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,300
Oh, God

183
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,450
Stand by, station two, for live fire!

184
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,210
I prefer the SIG

185
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,320
A lot of women have
trouble with the Beretta

186
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,410
Thing's got too much of a kick

187
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,910
Your sight is a
few millimeters off

188
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,710
- Really?
- Really

189
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,757
Prior to PFC Salazar's demise

190
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:55,555
Handcuffs made these
abrasions and lacerations

191
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,660
Yeah, well, he wasn't
held there long

192
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,270
No He was executed almost
immediately upon his confinement

193
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,440
- As to the cause of
death- - Gunshots

194
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,800
Well, yes and no

195
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,440
These wounds were made
by machine-gun fire

196
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,880
The spacing is too symmetrical
for random shooting

197
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,070
Also, they showed no signs of
redness or braiding and bruising,

198
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,550
indicating that our private was
long dead when he was strafed

199
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,610
How long?

200
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,360
About six hours based
on his liver temperature

201
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,080
And here

202
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:32,550
single round, nine millimeter
punctured the pericardial sac,

203
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,330
causing a cardiac tamponade

204
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,760
He suffered greatly, Jethro-
perhaps for 20 or 30 minutes-

205
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,500
and he did not die quickly

206
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,930
The bullet that killed him?

207
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,550
In the capable
hands of Abby Sciuto

208
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,980
You've never left a scene of a crime
before I arrived until this one, Jethro

209
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,320
Yeah Had something else to do

210
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,120
Something to do with your
Marine Corps service number?

211
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,510
I was wondering the
same thing myself

212
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,040
You're avoiding me

213
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,280
I've been busy
solving a murder, Leon

214
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,100
When I have something, you'll
be the first to know

215
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,440
I'm looking for a Marine file

216
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,870
A classified one

217
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,340
Top secret, eyes only

218
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,850
Black Ops

219
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,960
Gunnery Sergeant
Leroy Jethro Gibbs

220
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,230
Next time you having guests, probie
have some scotch in the house

221
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,633
Ah, you couldn't sweet-talk
the flight attendant

222
00:11:45,668 --> 00:11:46,475
Out a few of those little bottles?

223
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,240
- He wasn't my type
- Right

224
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,370
What's so urgent?

225
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,910
You pulled me away
from my granddaughter

226
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,940
Just celebrated
her second birthday

227
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,100
I'm looking for somebody

228
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,500
Rose

229
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,090
Vance know I'm here yet?

230
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,150
Not yet

231
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,900
Maybe I should borrow a tie

232
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,890
Colombia was a long time ago, gunny

233
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,900
Only one person knew about her

234
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,580
You

235
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,080
18 years is a long time, probie

236
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,050
She's in DCToday

237
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,070
Mike

238
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,530
What do you want me to say?

239
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,180
Whatever you're not saying

240
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,620
Well, how do you know
she's here, for sure?

241
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,980
My Marine service number was
written on the roof of a crime scene

242
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,110
In blood

243
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,150
That could have been anybody

244
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,880
I put a "G" on the
end of it, just for her

245
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,580
I brought her here 17 years ago

246
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,810
Where is she now?

247
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,180
I haven't seen her since
the day I dropped her off

248
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,520
Let's start there

249
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,850
You put her here?

250
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,580
Wasn't such a hellhole then

251
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,120
Que paso?

252
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,260
Que es lo que miras?

253
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,460
I'm looking for Rose Tamayo

254
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,160
Ma, alguien esta a la puerta

255
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,070
Que se les ofrece?

256
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,450
Buscando Rosa Tamayo?

257
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,090
Ella se murio hace diez años

258
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,090
We're a little late

259
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,720
She died ten years ago

260
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,170
Guess somebody else knows your
Marine service number, probie

261
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,790
Howdy, Leon

262
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,920
Mike

263
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:39,450
He has information
on a current case

264
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,720
And I need his help

265
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,230
Thanks for sorting out that
little pension problem, Leon

266
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,220
Appreciate it

267
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,450
I didn't do anything I wouldn't
have done for any former agent, Mike

268
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,470
All by the book

269
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,680
Absolutely By the book

270
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,060
That's how we operate now

271
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,750
Wouldn't have it
any other way, Leon

272
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,980
Think he noticed my tie?

273
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,060
What do we got?

274
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,410
We canvassed the area
No one is talking

275
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,720
- There is a smurf war
- Turf war

276
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,020
between two competing gangs, the
PCs and the Verde Psychos

277
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,830
Ballistics

278
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,420
We matched the slug that
killed PFC Salazar to a gun

279
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:22,250
that was used in an unsolved
robbery two weeks ago And

280
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:28,004
Metro's chief suspect is
Victor Carmado, a k a Popeye

281
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,950
Victor Carmado is a
known member of the PCs

282
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,120
He was hanging out with his
posse at Liberty Heights today

283
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,890
DiNozzo, Ziva, bring him in

284
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,030
Abby!

285
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,020
- Howdy, darling!
- Franks! What are you doing here?

286
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:03,070
Probie thinks I'm here helping him, but
it was just an excuse to come see you

287
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,590
Abs, turn it down

288
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,650
This is so cool

289
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,920
Someone writes your service number
on a roof, and then you just show up

290
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,400
It's like sending out the bat signal
and having Batman just show up

291
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,260
And his mentor, Ra's al Ghul

292
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,160
Or-or like Princess
Lela sending a hologram

293
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,380
"Help me, Obi-Wan "

294
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,690
And then getting Obi-Wan
with his mentor, Qui-Gon Jinn

295
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,110
You know, it's weird 'cause Liam
Neeson played both the mentors

296
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,530
You gonna tell me why I'm here?

297
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,380
Oh, um, I ran the blood
from the service number

298
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,740
It does not match our
dead Marine, Emilio Salazar

299
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,390
I already know that

300
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,510
Of course you do

301
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,610
Well, hopefully
it'll be news to you

302
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:49,206
That the blood
did belong to another Marine

303
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,680
Private First Class Tomas Tamayo

304
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,150
Judging by the look on your
face, that is news to you

305
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,690
Um, he comes from the same
neighborhood as PFC Salazar

306
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,811
According to his records

307
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:03,983
His mother died ten years ago
after emigrating from Colombia

308
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,920
Rose had a son?

309
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:11,190
Uh, yeah He was about a year
old when I brought her here

310
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,870
You knew?

311
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,990
I'm guessing you didn't

312
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,230
I need an address, Abs

313
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,280
57 Kensington Street

314
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,860
The home belongs to a
woman named Maggie Scott

315
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,590
Might want to take
this slow, probie

316
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,980
Might not like where it leads you

317
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,700
Popeye Carmado? NCIS

318
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,870
Are we all listening
to the same song?

319
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,150
Let me guess Ricky Martin fans

320
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,340
"Livin' La Vida Loca "

321
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,620
You ought to leave, man

322
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,520
But we just got here

323
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,410
Yeah But this is a very
dangerous neighborhood

324
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,020
That's why I brought her

325
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,740
La Bonita es una federale

326
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,020
Federales saben buenas

327
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,540
La Bonita will kick your ass

328
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,510
Is that right?

329
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,200
You know, bad things happen
in this place, mamita

330
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,070
But it's so homey, homey

331
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,180
I love what you've
done with the wall here

332
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,720
"Snoopy loves Chiquita?"

333
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,650
Which one of you sleeps on a
doghouse and which one's a bana?

334
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,850
I'm guessing the love is
between you two Am I wrong?

335
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,840
Think they want to play
rock, paper, scissors?

336
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,940
- You got them?
- I've got them

337
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,750
What's the matter? Popeye didn't
eat his spinach this morning?

338
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,310
Rico! Chuy!

339
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,960
Rico Suave's stuck in the '90s, and
Chewie's back with theMillennium Falcon

340
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,060
Let's go see how La Bonitadid

341
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,580
What took you so long?

342
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,300
McGee!

343
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,050
What are you doing? Why are you
digging through the NCIS database?

344
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,200
This woman called for Tony, and
I didn't get the number

345
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,580
It was blocked by the carrier, so
I am trying to coordinate a trace

346
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,270
Well, drop the call This
is much more important

347
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,960
Okay, what's up?

348
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,690
I heard something

349
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,500
Not a complete something, a
partial something

350
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:40,580
But enough of something to make
me think it means something

351
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:45,870
So I need to know if there's any
other something that you know about?

352
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,750
What-
I'm-I'm lost

353
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,600
Okay It's something about Gibbs

354
00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:00,130
And Colombia And
a woman named Rose

355
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,860
And a son she had 18 years ago

356
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:07,140
That would been 1991-
before Gibbs joined NCIS

357
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,280
Come on, McGee

358
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,870
Type something about the
something into something

359
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,130
Open, he's open

360
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,000
Give me the ball

361
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,240
Shoot it

362
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,300
Nice shooting, lady

363
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,030
Get a lot of practice around here

364
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,970
You Maggie Scott?

365
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,090
Hey, Henry, come in for me, okay?

366
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,020
What happened? You guys Metro?

367
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,500
NCIS

368
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,160
Who got hit? Somebody
from this block?

369
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,700
I understand this is the
home of Thomas Tamayo

370
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,570
Why? Is he all right?

371
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,360
He was involved in a murder

372
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,800
Oh, my God

373
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,290
No, he wasn't the victim

374
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,170
Someone a couple of streets over

375
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,610
Emilio Salazar

376
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:57,170
Emilio Yeah, he's a, uh, he's
a friend of Tomas's

377
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,480
His mother, has anyone
contacted Emilio's mother?

378
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,070
Being done now Where is Tomas?

379
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,970
He's on leave, Cape
Hatteras Before Afghanistan

380
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,860
Wrong He was at a crime
scene last night in DC

381
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,160
Hold on

382
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,800
You were his legal guardian?

383
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,730
Legal guardian to
a lot of these kids

384
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,010
Keeps them out of the system

385
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,220
I just watch them till their
moms get home from work

386
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,880
Most of them don't have fathers

387
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,440
Two of them lost
siblings, past couple months

388
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,070
War?

389
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,280
Gang war

390
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,400
You're not from
around here, are you?

391
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,260
I moved here after college
Part of the Vista program

392
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,590
I never left

393
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,790
How'd you become Thomas's guardian?

394
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,750
Tomas moved in about 12 years back

395
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,270
Then when Rose got sick-
his mother has cancer-

396
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,860
she asked me to look after him

397
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,390
He's a good kid He's
a really good kid

398
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:51,620
Oh, my God, It's okay He's here

399
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,550
It's Tomas It's Tomas

400
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,890
Tomas!

401
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,480
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine What is this?

402
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,610
I was so worried about you

403
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,140
What's going on?

404
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,330
You want to tell us where you
been for the past 48 hours?

405
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,040
Cape Hatteras with friends

406
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,320
We checked

407
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,690
Your cell calls were all made
from a two-block area of DC

408
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,590
Why were you being held here?

409
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,510
I wasn't

410
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,420
My military service number

411
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,620
Your blood on the roof

412
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:45,140
You got my attention, Thomas
I'm here What do you want?

413
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,680
It wasn't me

414
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,200
I cut myself traing

415
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,900
Gibbs and the kid

416
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,870
It was your damn blood on the roof

417
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,780
- What's the connection?
- We tested it

418
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,900
And why the kid gloves?

419
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,500
Hey, let me out!

420
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,770
Our friend from the hood

421
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,520
- Think he's chilled long enough?
- Let me out of here, man!

422
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,440
Time to unpop his cork

423
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,490
Let me out of here!

424
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,930
Cool it, Coolio! No
gangbanging on the walls

425
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,220
Sit down

426
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,110
- I ain't sitting down
- Sientate!

427
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,720
Or do you want La Bonita
to sit your ass down?

428
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,290
I thought you all forgot
about me, that's all

429
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,930
You in a hurry to
get somewhere, Popeye?

430
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,300
'Cause you sure ain't going home to
Olive Oyl and Sweet Pea any time soon

431
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,580
You're going to prison

432
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,680
Says who?

433
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,560
Says the nine-millimeter slug we
pulled out of PFC Emilio Salazar

434
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,500
Matches the slug from another
shooting you were involved in

435
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,480
If witnesses put me there, I'd
have been locked up already

436
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,300
We have a dead Marine, former
gang member of yours

437
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,270
This is the murder weapon

438
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,750
Found dumped in a storm
drain Recognize it?

439
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,420
That's it? That's all you got?

440
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,120
It's all we need

441
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,660
It's all circumstantial

442
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,610
I think you got nothing

443
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,410
I think what you
need is a confession

444
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:14,460
You are looking at ten years for
accessory to a murder of a USMarine

445
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:17,710
More if we tag you for murder one

446
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,140
Your sweat was on that roof

447
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,920
Your pee was on that roof

448
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,420
Your blood was on that roof

449
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,610
You gonna tell us what
happened on that roof?

450
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,850
You're gonna tell us
who else was there

451
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,060
Who put that bullet in PFC Salazar

452
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:38,200
We're gonna have to
assume it was you

453
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,750
I didn't kill Emilio

454
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,700
- Who did?
- Me

455
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,790
I killed the little bitch

456
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,990
You killed PFC Salazar?

457
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,400
Yeah, I did it You got me

458
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,900
The fool deserved to die

459
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,990
How'd it go down, Victor?

460
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,970
I shot him That's
how it went down

461
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,420
Put the gun to
his head- pow

462
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,460
Blew his brains out

463
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,930
You shot him in the head?

464
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,880
Lights out, baby

465
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,680
JFK style

466
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,180
Back and to the
left, know what I'm saying?

467
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,340
One shot to the chest

468
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,640
That's what killed
your friend Emilio

469
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,550
But he didn't die right
away It took time

470
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,440
Maybe 20 minutes

471
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,500
Bullet nicked his heart

472
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:30,180
Blood poured into his lungs

473
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,300
- Remember, Tomas?
- No

474
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,510
He would have had
trouble breathing

475
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,040
The pain must have
been excruciating

476
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,415
But you know all this
don't you, Marine?

477
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,517
I wasn't there

478
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,410
Popeye didn't pop the guy

479
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,700
No way a kid like that
took down two Marines

480
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,800
Probably taking credit for a
street kill to elevate his stature

481
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,230
Get anything on PFC Tamayo?

482
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,240
- He's scared
- He's hiding something

483
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,380
They both are

484
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,210
Something more going on than that

485
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,530
You're right, probie

486
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,670
Gangbangers don't
kidnap their enemies

487
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,940
They shoot them in the street

488
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,300
Somebody's pulling
strings, calling shots

489
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,820
I think I know who

490
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:10,340
I've been crosschecking the Metro Gang
Task Force's list of known PC members

491
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,460
against cell numbers
registered in their names

492
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,260
One common phone
number keeps popping up

493
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,125
It's a number from outside
the neighborhood

494
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,751
That called almost every member
of the PC gang

495
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,120
That's the COfrom
the shooting range

496
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,990
Staff sergeant Vicente Medina

497
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,590
That's not all I looked into
the staff sergeant's history

498
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,060
It seems he shares a bit more
than phone records in common

499
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,220
He wasn't just
recruiting from the PCs

500
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,430
He was a member

501
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,110
Get him in here

502
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,230
- Yeah, Gibbs
- Meet you in my office

503
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,120
I'll be right there

504
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,550
- Marine file
- It's yours

505
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,430
I haven't read it yet, and I
won't if you'd prefer I didn't

506
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,102
I thought it might shed some light
on what the hell happened in Colombia

507
00:26:55,137 --> 00:26:58,154
18 years ago
unless you'd prefer to

508
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,640
I got nothing to hide, Leon

509
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,380
Everybody's got something to hide

510
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,640
Franks a part of this?

511
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,800
A little part

512
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,070
Some good stuff in
the last five pages

513
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,800
How many men have you killed?

514
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,180
Seven confirmed

515
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,980
Where?

516
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:43,290
Three in Anbar, two in Fallouja, one
in Baghdad, one in Tora Bora

517
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,550
How about Washington, DC?

518
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,340
None

519
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,700
You knew Emilio Salazar?

520
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,230
His platoon sergeant, sir

521
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,990
He's a gang member
just like you are

522
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,990
That was a long time ago

523
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,320
That was last night!

524
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,080
Sir, I did not kill that Marine!

525
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,410
Whatwereyou doing last night?

526
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,130
I was at home watching TV

527
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,310
Anybody watching you watching TV?

528
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,450
No

529
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,850
Your place is 20 minutes
from our crime scene

530
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,870
Phone records

531
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,620
You made contact with half the
PC posse over the past six months

532
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:30,070
Rap sheet; yours

533
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:33,560
Shot caller for the
PCs for three years

534
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:38,010
Once a Marine, always a Marine

535
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,490
Or once a PC, always a PC

536
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,180
I lived the life
It's not a secret

537
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,707
I liked it, till I saw what
was happening to my friends

538
00:28:47,742 --> 00:28:53,066
In dead or jail by 17
so I joined the Marine Corps

539
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,007
Made me a better person
came back to the hood

540
00:28:55,042 --> 00:28:57,754
And tried to convince others
to make something of themselves

541
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:06,460
Ran a system-wide facial
recognition search

542
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:09,140
I thought you'd want
to see this right away

543
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,530
Okay, let's try this again
Where were you last night?

544
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,270
I... I told you I was at home

545
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,790
Baltimore! That was
taken last night!

546
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,500
You couldn't have killed him

547
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,860
Why are you lying?

548
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:35,040
I went to visit my son

549
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,510
When I was 15, I made some mistakes

550
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,110
I got a girl pregnant
And my wife

551
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,680
she doesn't know I have a kid

552
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,050
I know what we got; nothing

553
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,280
Guess we all make
mistakes, huh, probie?

554
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,070
Got two Marines chained
to a roof Don't know why

555
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,800
Got somebody behind it pulling
strings Don't know who

556
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,128
Can we wind the clock back
to the part

557
00:30:08,163 --> 00:30:10,409
Where we find out what
Gibbs was doing in Colombia?

558
00:30:10,444 --> 00:30:12,330
Or how it is connected to the gang?

559
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,610
Got a punk who didn't kill
anybody who says he did,

560
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,740
and a kid who wrote probie's service
number in blood saying he didn't

561
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,200
You done?

562
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,900
Done watching you shave
with a butter knife

563
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,300
Let me talk to that kid

564
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,530
I'll get him to tell us what
the hell's going on here

565
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,610
I can't do that, Mike I let him go

566
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,920
You what?

567
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,770
If you want to find
something, you follow it

568
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,040
I learned that one from you

569
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,860
You two

570
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,830
- MTAC with McGee
- Got it, boss

571
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,730
Think I don't know
what you're doing?

572
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,740
Trying to get that boy off?

573
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,480
Yeah, gonna lead us to the truth

574
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,590
The truth

575
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,610
Yeah, which you should
have told me 17 years ago

576
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:17,930
When I got Rose out of Colombia, you
were happily married again

577
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:20,920
- Or so I thought
- What's the truth?

578
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,890
The truth is, she
didn't want you to know!

579
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,590
She knew you were still putting
the pieces back together

580
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,419
After Shannon and Kelly

581
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:35,050
Didn't want to
complicate your life

582
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,390
Guess she didn't get
her wish after all

583
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:43,560
Maybe Gibbs was on a covert mission
to suppress the Fujimori coup

584
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,400
That was Peru, not Colombia

585
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:51,750
Okay, boss, we're still following the
GPS signal from PFC Tamayo's cell phone

586
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,750
He drove to Quantico He's
been there about 20 minutes

587
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,430
Quantico's that way, probie

588
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,260
We're not going to Quantico That's
his first stop We're going to his last

589
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:10,050
Like the lady
said, Mike "It's a war "

590
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,910
So he's down in Colombia in Bogota

591
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,760
He saves President Clinton's life,

592
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,670
but nobody can talk about
it because it's super secret

593
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,880
Clinton did not serve until '93

594
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:20,890
Stop obsessing!

595
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,320
I'm not obsessing! I'm
a little preoccupied

596
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:27,840
I'm a tad fascinated by the whole
subject, but I amnot obsessing

597
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,000
What was he doing in
Colombia 17 years ago?

598
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,580
18 years ago- and
it's classified, DiNozzo

599
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:39,300
Is that classified, too, or can
you share with your director?

600
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,250
We're, uh, tracking a
suspect for Gibbs, Director

601
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,570
Franks is with him?

602
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,140
That's what I thought

603
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,300
PFC Tamayo's just left Quantico

604
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,030
He's now headed
towards Liberty Heights

605
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,220
So, what do you want us to do?

606
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,900
Whatever you were doing
before I walked in

607
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:59,210
What's Tamayo's duty
assignment at Quantico?

608
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,700
Guard duty at the base armory

609
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,650
And the dead Marine?

610
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,920
PFC Salazar was also
a guard at the armory

611
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,630
Means they both had
access to the armory codes

612
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,440
Stepping back Excuse me

613
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,830
- Get base security on the phone
- Yes, sir

614
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:19,070
Hey, if this kid starts shooting
you're gonna shoot back, right?

615
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:27,280
This is a really bad time, Leon

616
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:30,160
I just got off the phone with
the Armory OICat Quantico

617
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,820
Four crates of M-4
assault rifles are missing

618
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,170
That's your PFC Tamayo, Gibbs

619
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,720
Gangs, guns It adds up

620
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,060
We're still monitoring his GPS

621
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,280
- He's headed back toward the projects
- The projects?

622
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,870
Yeah, we got him, we got him

623
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:55,380
I did what you wanted, okay?

624
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,960
No, you listen to me!

625
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,230
You want 'em, you come get 'em

626
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,470
Second floor-
I'm waiting

627
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,570
This is about to get
real interesting, probie

628
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:11,090
McGee, building across the street

629
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,060
Traffic camera, 3837 Ashton

630
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,820
- Got it
- Record it

631
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,950
Recording

632
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,580
You alone, homes?

633
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,550
Zoom in on those guys

634
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,630
In Those two

635
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,030
Aren't those the two guys?

636
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,140
Chuy and Rico I should
have hit them harder

637
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,290
You got 'em?

638
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:53,530
Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Put your hands
in the air! Put your hands in the air!

639
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,720
You thought you were gonna use
Marine guns to kill my friends?

640
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:57,890
Something's going down

641
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:58,910
Somebody's behind him

642
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,070
McGee, zoom out, zoom out

643
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,200
No! This ends here!

644
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,740
What the hell?

645
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,990
Don't move, Sergeant

646
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,970
DiNozzo, call for an
ambulance and backup

647
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:37,300
Everywhere you
go, kid, somebody gets shot

648
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:40,920
3832 Ashton shots fired
Possible multiple casualties

649
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,300
Keep pressure on it, Sergeant

650
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,490
Hey, Leon

651
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,490
Let me talk to him

652
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,650
He's busy Can I take a message?

653
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,390
You just shot somebody, Franks

654
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,940
Yeah All by the book, Leon

655
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,390
Retired-agent-
involved shooting

656
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,840
That's still a form KJ-65, right?

657
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,610
- Nice talking to you, Leon
- Fra

658
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,790
It was me

659
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,584
I ordered him to take those weapons
off the base

660
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:12,926
And bring 'em here like they wanted

661
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:14,260
Why?

662
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,990
- Because I was
- No, not you You

663
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,410
They held me on the roof

664
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:25,140
Said they'd hurt everyone I love
unless I got them the assault weapons

665
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,510
I... I didn't believe them

666
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,100
They used to be my friends

667
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,670
Then they threatened Emilio

668
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,040
Shot him in front of me

669
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,120
I thought they were
gonna kill me, too

670
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,910
That why you wrote
my service number?

671
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,480
When I found out you were
NCIS, I wanted to tell you, but

672
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,570
I ordered him not to

673
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,670
Why?

674
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:50,437
Using Marine guns
to kill kids in my hood

675
00:36:50,472 --> 00:36:53,165
Kids I was trying to save
it made me sick

676
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,570
I wanted to handle it myself

677
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:02,110
We take care of our own

678
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,800
Those guys are just the hired help

679
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,710
- That is all you have to say?
- Yes

680
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,360
I did it, I admit it I'll
give you a full confession

681
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,430
Can I talk to him?

682
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,910
No, he's going to prison

683
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,650
Please, I

684
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:26,120
He stole weapons from a Marine
base to arm a street gang

685
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,360
People died

686
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:31,310
He confessed to everything

687
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,910
All of it, his idea

688
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,360
And he's going away

689
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,780
Unless you've got something to say

690
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,660
Wait He didn't do
anything He's lying

691
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:54,240
Hold up

692
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,050
Nobody was supposed to get hurt

693
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,670
They were supposed to scare them so
that Tomas or Emilio would get the guns

694
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:05,000
For the PC's Emilio
wasn't supposed to get shot

695
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,210
That was an accident, I swear

696
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,880
Who need weapons, Maggie?

697
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,590
Our kids

698
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,850
In the neighborhood, on our block

699
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,490
They were getting killed every day

700
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:20,240
Slaughtered by drug
dealers and bigger gangs

701
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:23,410
They are dying every day!

702
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,780
I had to protect them

703
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:28,510
By what, arming them
with assault rifles?

704
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,920
I grew up in the Cold War

705
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,290
My dad talked
about deterrence-

706
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:35,680
if you build up an arsenal that rivals
your enemy's, they won't attack you

707
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,700
You understand?

708
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,450
Case closed- my
case, and you being on it

709
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,050
"Melinda 555-0199"

710
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,550
Hold the phone, Malone, I
know that number

711
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,540
You should- it's
your dentist's office

712
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,580
They rescheduled your appointment

713
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,460
Ooh, thatMelinda

714
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,960
The one with the man hands

715
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,210
Well, I hope you
learned a lesson, probie

716
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,030
Yeah- never to pick
up your phone again

717
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,510
Wait a second

718
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,880
It was right in front
of me the whole time

719
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,470
Franks! I've got
a question for you

720
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,940
Got a plane to catch

721
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,180
18 years ago, Colombia

722
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,530
Gibbs was doing drug
interdiction down there

723
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,760
Tomas is 18, from Colombia

724
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,960
Knows Gibbs's Marine
service number

725
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,700
Question?

726
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,300
Is Gibbs Tomas's father?

727
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:54,160
Tell probie thanks for the lend

728
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,260
No Sit down As you were

729
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,830
Your orders

730
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,540
Shipping out to Afghanistan

731
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,980
I... I'm not going to jail?

732
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,970
You helped the investigation

733
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:26,040
My mother used to tell me
this story about a Marine

734
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,610
He came to help out our village

735
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:36,150
But the drug cartel
came after him

736
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:40,070
shot him He almost died

737
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:49,470
She hid him, helped him heal

738
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,640
That was you

739
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,480
And when you finally got well

740
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:09,010
you told her that if
she ever need any help,

741
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,640
she could give that number to
any Marine and you would find her

742
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,750
She made me memorize that number

743
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,210
You're the reason
I became a Marine

744
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:37,190
When your mother saved my life, she
was already pregnant with you

745
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,600
Most people, they don't
get a second chance

746
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,480
Good luck

747
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,730
Semper Fi

748
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:03,210
Ooh-rah

749
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:09,131
Read about the mission
to eliminate Cesar Castillo

750
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:11,235
From the Cali Cartel in Colombia

751
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,260
Good read?

752
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,680
It was impressive

753
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:19,800
Took out your target with one
shot to the heart from 1, 200 yards

754
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,060
This Castillo was a piece of work

755
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:26,270
Drug dealer, torturer, rapist

756
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,320
I did my job

757
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,283
And the mission would've gone
off without a hitch

758
00:42:30,722 --> 00:42:32,762
If you hadn't been wounded

759
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:37,460
Well, I guess you're
all caught up now, Leon

760
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,690
Must've been poignant helping out the
son of the woman that saved your life

761
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:46,730
Did you tell the boy that the
man you killed was his father?
