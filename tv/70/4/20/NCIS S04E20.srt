1
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,001
Let's move! Let's go!

2
00:00:09,902 --> 00:00:11,207
Get those VA's on!

3
00:00:11,496 --> 00:00:13,888
Pull it two and a half,
let's get ready to roll.

4
00:00:15,018 --> 00:00:16,728
Davis, get those utilities turned off.

5
00:00:16,729 --> 00:00:17,955
Quickly! Move it!

6
00:00:17,956 --> 00:00:19,041
I'm on it, sir!

7
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:20,577
We're in front! You take the back!

8
00:00:20,578 --> 00:00:22,490
Scotty, you're with me! Let's move!

9
00:00:23,435 --> 00:00:25,217
Let's go.

10
00:00:27,156 --> 00:00:28,221
You two spread out.

11
00:00:28,256 --> 00:00:30,191
Clear the bedrooms,
I'll take the kitchen.

12
00:00:30,226 --> 00:00:31,049
We'll cover this side here.

13
00:00:31,056 --> 00:00:33,044
All right! I'm going right!

14
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:42,675
Every damn time.

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,965
False alarm, fellas!

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,980
Just another over cooked bird.

17
00:00:46,174 --> 00:00:47,583
Or something.

18
00:00:51,527 --> 00:00:53,783
Tough to tell after six hours in the...

19
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:55,480
...oven.

20
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,234
Double Americano for Thom.

21
00:02:05,076 --> 00:02:06,132
Aren't you Thom?

22
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,304
Yes. Thank you. Sorry.

23
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:11,568
Must need that badly. Don't
even recognize your own name.

24
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:12,921
Medium mocha coming up.

25
00:02:12,922 --> 00:02:14,721
It's... my other name.

26
00:02:15,192 --> 00:02:17,597
- Two names?
- Well, two jobs.

27
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:18,664
It's Thom when I'm writing.

28
00:02:18,665 --> 00:02:21,205
Not that I've actually
written anything in weeks.

29
00:02:21,206 --> 00:02:22,348
Writer's block?

30
00:02:25,843 --> 00:02:27,316
Creative stifling.

31
00:02:27,317 --> 00:02:30,669
I am crumbling under the
pressure of expectations.

32
00:02:31,512 --> 00:02:33,158
You're Thom E. Gemcity.

33
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:36,407
Your photo's on the back
cover. I loved Deep Six.

34
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:37,752
Thanks.

35
00:02:37,753 --> 00:02:38,811
Landon. Thank you.

36
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,103
Can't wait to see what happens next.

37
00:02:41,104 --> 00:02:42,444
You and me both.

38
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:45,383
Two weeks until my deadline,
I'm stuck here in Chapter Seven.

39
00:02:45,384 --> 00:02:46,741
Well, could be worse.

40
00:02:47,052 --> 00:02:48,135
How's that?

41
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:49,677
Could be Chapter Six.

42
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,130
Okay, we got a half-caf percent
latte and a medium double decaf...

43
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:56,202
McGee.

44
00:02:56,203 --> 00:02:58,294
<i>- And there you go.
- Yeah.</i>

45
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:02,621
- The other job.
- Good luck.

46
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:07,267
Ferris Bueller's Day Off...

47
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:08,854
John Hughes masterpiece.

48
00:03:09,211 --> 00:03:11,883
Now, there's a guy who didn't have
time for writer's block, probie.

49
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:15,836
Sixteen Candles, Uncle
Buck, The Breakfast Club.

50
00:03:16,257 --> 00:03:17,626
I do not have...

51
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:23,476
...I'm just struggling to find out the
most efficient way to tell my next story.

52
00:03:23,477 --> 00:03:26,002
Now, do you think Hughes
writes on a computer

53
00:03:26,003 --> 00:03:28,375
or does he use an old-fashioned
typewriter, like you?

54
00:03:29,097 --> 00:03:32,022
Well, I'm sure he uses a
computer, Tony. Most write do.

55
00:03:32,443 --> 00:03:33,932
You ever consider converting?

56
00:03:34,638 --> 00:03:36,990
I don't think that's
the reason for my...

57
00:03:37,742 --> 00:03:39,820
Were you gonna say writer's block?

58
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:42,497
I like my typewriter.

59
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:44,298
But it doesn't Iike you.

60
00:03:45,383 --> 00:03:49,691
It's a classic tale of unrequited
love between a boy and his machine.

61
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:53,209
You can use that if you want. But
remember you got to have a love story.

62
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,792
I can see the poster already.

63
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:58,326
The house is leased to
Petty Officer Darren Cove.

64
00:03:58,327 --> 00:04:01,544
No roommates, but according to
the neighbors, he's rarely alone.

65
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:04,852
I can tell. Got a fridge full of beer.

66
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:06,867
No hard alcohol.

67
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:08,083
Except for this.

68
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:13,125
If smells could kill, I think
we just found our murder weapon.

69
00:04:13,126 --> 00:04:14,869
I'm more concerned with
where they came from.

70
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,894
Neighbors said this was
a notorious party house.

71
00:04:17,895 --> 00:04:19,945
Maybe someone brought in the mixers.

72
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:21,479
Then they left with them, too.

73
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,142
Seems like a lot of effort
for a couple of drinks.

74
00:04:24,143 --> 00:04:25,906
Wasted effort.

75
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:28,252
The blood search at
the Ping-Pong table.

76
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:30,087
Beer-pong.

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,624
This is tragic, don't tell me you've
never played beer-pong before, probie.

78
00:04:36,248 --> 00:04:38,516
What did you do at MIT?

79
00:04:38,518 --> 00:04:39,556
Studied.

80
00:04:39,557 --> 00:04:42,524
That figures. Beer-pong
is a drinking game,

81
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:45,430
the object of which is to
take the Ping-Pong ball,

82
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:48,538
and try and get it into
the other team's cups.

83
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,562
Show me how it's done.

84
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:55,562
This is a crime scene, not a frat house.

85
00:04:57,606 --> 00:04:59,356
You hearing voices, probie?

86
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:02,286
Figured you saw Gibbs coming.

87
00:05:02,287 --> 00:05:06,827
I just don't think this is the time or
the place to showcase my beer-pong skills.

88
00:05:09,324 --> 00:05:10,572
What?

89
00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:12,435
Seems out of character.

90
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:15,388
Yeah, yeah.

91
00:05:15,869 --> 00:05:18,245
No, you may not use me to
get over your writer's block.

92
00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:21,045
McGee has writer's
block? No, McGee does not.

93
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:25,135
Just do what you did last
time... write about us.

94
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:28,395
Okay, I've told you guys a million
times, the book is not about you.

95
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:31,584
No, of course not... it's
about Special Agent Tommy.

96
00:05:31,585 --> 00:05:33,438
And Officer Lisa.

97
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,671
DiNozzo!

98
00:05:34,912 --> 00:05:36,040
And L.J. Tibbs.

99
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:43,898
Get this.

100
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,772
Looks like McGee wasn't
the only writer here today.

101
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:53,757
Bag it.

102
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:59,878
Petty Officer Cove joined the Navy three
years ago, right out of high school.

103
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:02,838
His CO says he's a little
immature, but basically a good kid.

104
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,667
Good kid with a criminal record.

105
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:08,230
Since enlisting, he's been
arrested twice,both misdemeanors.

106
00:06:08,231 --> 00:06:11,764
Public intox in '04, and a noise
ordinance violation last July.

107
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:14,527
"Works to live, and lives to party".

108
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:17,535
His... CO's words.

109
00:06:17,536 --> 00:06:21,224
Guys in his command call
him Darren "Diddy" Cove.

110
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,049
Why?

111
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,812
It's a reference to Sean Diddy Combs.

112
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:27,629
The Puff Man, P Diddy.

113
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,336
Rap impresario. Went out with J-Lo.

114
00:06:31,903 --> 00:06:33,758
Petty Officer Cove
was on duty yesterday.

115
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,027
Left the base at 1800,
hasn't been seen since.

116
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,403
And neither has his blue Ford Ranger.

117
00:06:38,404 --> 00:06:40,289
Should be in his garage, but it's not.

118
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,943
Which means lis attacker took it.

119
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,973
went Petty Officer Cove for a drive.

120
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:46,344
With that amount of blood loss,
it's doubtful he was conscious.

121
00:06:46,345 --> 00:06:48,187
If it was all his blood.

122
00:06:49,172 --> 00:06:52,686
Well, Abby'll tell us, because Cove's
blood sample is in his medical records.

123
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:57,576
I'm gonna go check the BOLO, see
if he's got a hit on the pickup.

124
00:06:57,577 --> 00:06:58,965
That's not necessary, McGee.

125
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:02,201
Norfolk Police just found
it abandoned along Highway 5.

126
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:11,089
I've noticed oversized dice
like these in numerous vehicles.

127
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,788
Do they serve a purpose?

128
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:15,225
Hello?

129
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,278
Tony?

130
00:07:16,906 --> 00:07:19,342
- What?
- Do they serve a purpose?

131
00:07:19,343 --> 00:07:21,524
Fuzzy dice... pretty
good redneck indicator.

132
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,096
Other than that, no, they
don't serve a purpose.

133
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:26,216
Got a lot more blood back here, boss.

134
00:07:26,217 --> 00:07:28,278
Think this was used to cover the body?

135
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,881
Yeah. Or bodies.

136
00:07:31,468 --> 00:07:33,348
Yeah, Abs... I'm listening.

137
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:44,850
McGee, you look like you've seen a goat.

138
00:07:47,493 --> 00:07:49,403
Ghost. "Seen a ghost".

139
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,259
Yeah.

140
00:07:51,944 --> 00:07:53,282
Do you know what déjà vu is?

141
00:07:53,283 --> 00:07:56,295
Bien sûr. My French is
better than my English.

142
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,753
Right.

143
00:07:57,754 --> 00:07:59,077
So...

144
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,100
What?

145
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:03,582
- The déjà vu.
- I can't place it.

146
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:12,353
By any chance, did you
start dating someone, McGee?

147
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,109
Dating? Please, I spend every
spare minute I have writing.

148
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,033
Hang on a second. McGee.

149
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:21,982
Get this towed back to
lockup. Yeah, go on, Abs.

150
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:23,606
Abby's got something.

151
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,444
Watch out! It's Halloween
at Coyote Ugly, Piper Perabo.

152
00:08:39,445 --> 00:08:42,223
Oh, if you like that one,
you're gonna love this.

153
00:08:42,224 --> 00:08:44,404
It's a, uh, it's a Sciuto original.

154
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:46,524
I like to call it "Bottoms Up".

155
00:08:48,686 --> 00:08:50,701
I had no idea you
were a bartender, Abby.

156
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:52,962
Well, my Uncle Teddy used
to own a bar on Canal Street,

157
00:08:52,963 --> 00:08:55,158
and I used to bartend
there on the weekends.

158
00:08:57,534 --> 00:08:59,173
The case, Abby?

159
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:03,683
But, Gibbs, you haven't even
seen my famous Fire Bomb.

160
00:09:07,037 --> 00:09:08,179
It can wait.

161
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,784
So, uh, I tested the blood that
was in Petty Officer Cove's house.

162
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:14,471
Most of it was his, but
one sample did not match.

163
00:09:14,472 --> 00:09:18,161
It could've been from a prior accident
or an altercation at one of his parties.

164
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:21,211
- Or it could be the killer's.
- I also ran...

165
00:09:21,587 --> 00:09:24,278
the prints from our mystery cocktails.

166
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:27,661
One half of our drinking duo was
definitely Petty Officer Cove.

167
00:09:27,662 --> 00:09:30,661
- The other half?
- Well, it's a work in progress, Gibbs.

168
00:09:30,662 --> 00:09:32,703
Tell me you have more than this, Abby.

169
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:35,763
Have I ever let you
down? Don't answer that.

170
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:40,098
I'm using my mass spectrometer to
break down the molecular structure

171
00:09:40,099 --> 00:09:41,791
of the cocktails in question.

172
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:44,695
- Guessing that's where all these come in.
- Well, you guessed correctly.

173
00:09:44,696 --> 00:09:49,462
I think I've made over 100
delightful beverages trying to find...

174
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,229
the match.

175
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,012
The weirding is, this baby isn't
in any bartending guide anywhere.

176
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,148
It's made out of Jagermeister...

177
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:02,889
Cherry soda, vanilla vodka, lemon
juice and a splash of Tabasco.

178
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:06,122
It's called a "Hairy Hangover. "

179
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,584
And you came to know this how, McGee?

180
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:12,321
I created it.

181
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:17,836
Our missing petty officer is
a character in my next book.

182
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,240
"Cameron Meyer is a good old
boy from Northern Virginia.

183
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:31,862
"He was born with not
much, raised with even less.

184
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:34,615
"All he wants out of life is
a good girl and a great truck.

185
00:10:34,616 --> 00:10:36,456
"As of yesterday, he's halfway there.

186
00:10:36,457 --> 00:10:40,396
"He dropped his life savings
on a blue Ford Ranger".

187
00:10:41,097 --> 00:10:43,292
- That's it?
- Tony, it's all here.

188
00:10:43,293 --> 00:10:46,482
The fuzzy dice, the cinnamon
rolls, red track jacket.

189
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,707
Petty Officer Cove is Cameron Meyer.

190
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,158
But how is that possible, McGee?

191
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:59,051
My writing isn't entirely fiction. Okay.

192
00:10:59,052 --> 00:11:03,461
My stories are, but sometimes I
base my characters on people I...

193
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,742
Work with.

194
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:07,677
See. People I see.

195
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:09,692
You've seen Petty Officer Cove before?

196
00:11:09,693 --> 00:11:11,511
Every morning at my coffee shop.

197
00:11:11,512 --> 00:11:13,692
But how come you didn't
recognize his photograph?

198
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:15,180
He only uses the drive-through.

199
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:18,778
To me, he's just the large coffee with
acinnamon roll guy in the blue pickup.

200
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:19,951
I never saw his face.

201
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:22,056
Whoa, whoa, wait-wait
a minute. Back up.

202
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,491
Your coffee shop has a drive-through?

203
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:26,315
That's... That's not important.

204
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:29,346
Just because you based your
character on a person who is missing,

205
00:11:29,347 --> 00:11:32,301
does not necessarily mean the
two of them are related, McGee.

206
00:11:32,302 --> 00:11:33,730
Yeah, it does.

207
00:11:34,136 --> 00:11:35,730
You created the drink.

208
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:37,309
Made it up about a month ago.

209
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:41,877
How did two glasses of it get from your
head to inside Petty Officer Cove's house?

210
00:11:41,878 --> 00:11:43,321
Someone's read your book.

211
00:11:43,322 --> 00:11:45,381
Your papers under lock and key?

212
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:49,961
Well, I sent my publisher a
copy a couple weeks ago, but,

213
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:52,122
- you know, I'm sure she...
- Address.

214
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:00,421
Boss, there's more.

215
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:03,876
After Deep Six hit the stores,

216
00:12:03,877 --> 00:12:08,718
my publishing firm received a ton of
e- mails addressed to Thom E. Gemcity.

217
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:10,628
Tons?

218
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:20,521
Most of them are autograph
requests or feedback on the novel,

219
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:23,533
but in the last couple weeks, my
publisher says that we've gotten

220
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,074
some really weird letters,
borderline obsessive.

221
00:12:26,075 --> 00:12:28,736
I didn't say anything because
I assumed they were harmless.

222
00:12:28,737 --> 00:12:30,284
DiNozzo, with me.

223
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:33,073
McGee, you stay here with Ziva.
Start going through your book.

224
00:12:33,074 --> 00:12:36,081
- What exactly am I looking for?
- Answers, McGee.

225
00:12:40,897 --> 00:12:43,490
Miss Crawshaw will be with you shortly.

226
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,221
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

227
00:12:47,673 --> 00:12:50,065
Is there anything else I
can get you while you wait?

228
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:52,386
- Yeah, a barf bag.
- I'm sorry.

229
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,490
<i>Todd,</i>

230
00:12:53,777 --> 00:12:57,089
black tea, lemon, crab salad,

231
00:12:57,669 --> 00:12:58,811
arugula.

232
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:01,973
You're Timothy's people.

233
00:13:02,494 --> 00:13:05,052
A few weeks ago, he sent
you a draft of his next book?

234
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:06,878
Partial. It wasn't finished yet

235
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:09,028
Yeah, it still isn't, is it?

236
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:10,997
How many of your people
here have read the book?

237
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:12,133
Zero.

238
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:16,790
No one in my agency has access to advance
material without the writer's consent.

239
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,757
Except you.

240
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:25,808
Writers are notoriously
insecure. Soft, even.

241
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:29,020
Well, thatoesn't sound like
our little Timmy McGee, does it?

242
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:34,695
Whether they ask for it or not, I
provide coddling, prodding, protection.

243
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:38,999
Anything it takes to keep
those elusive muses singing.

244
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,590
Agent...?

245
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:41,821
Gibbs.

246
00:13:44,113 --> 00:13:46,174
Here we go. Rock Hollow:

247
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:48,794
The Continuing Adventures of L.J. Tibbs.

248
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:51,297
How is this connected
with your investigation?

249
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:54,474
A person's missing. We believe it's
related to the contents of that book.

250
00:13:55,904 --> 00:13:58,459
Guess I just made myself
your prime suspect.

251
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,810
Sounds about right.

252
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,565
I may be the only one in the firm
who's read it, Agent Gibbs, but

253
00:14:04,566 --> 00:14:07,635
I can guarantee you I'm not
the only one in the city.

254
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:11,233
McGee hasn't given the book
to anyone else, Miss Crawshaw.

255
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:16,169
Obsessed fans always find
a way to get material early.

256
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,699
They dig through trash, hack computers,

257
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,723
anything short of writing it themselves.

258
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:24,501
And believe me, Timothy has some
of the craziest fans I've ever seen.

259
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:25,841
Yeah, we know about the letters.

260
00:14:25,842 --> 00:14:28,884
Yeah, there are three that stand
out. Todd, bring me those three...

261
00:14:28,885 --> 00:14:30,511
Gemcity letters?

262
00:14:30,512 --> 00:14:31,869
No return addresses.

263
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:34,067
Each one's stranger than the last.

264
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:37,631
I bet the psychopath you're looking
for is somewhere in that envelope.

265
00:14:37,673 --> 00:14:39,784
What makes you think we're
looking for a psychopath?

266
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:41,538
Don't you read crime novels?

267
00:14:42,835 --> 00:14:44,830
There are always psychopaths.

268
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:50,463
"I am sending this letter
to express my gratitude

269
00:14:50,464 --> 00:14:53,406
"for the literary gift you've given me.

270
00:14:53,407 --> 00:14:56,193
"The majesty of your
writing is far beyond

271
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:58,256
anything this planet has ever seen".

272
00:14:58,257 --> 00:14:59,659
A rave review.

273
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,286
Rave, indeed, Jethro.

274
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:04,498
Yeah. In fact, it's quite
possible that Michael

275
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,256
is Timothy's greatest admirer.

276
00:15:07,257 --> 00:15:09,662
Admirer, or stalker, Duck?

277
00:15:09,663 --> 00:15:14,495
At this point, I'd say he is no mediate
threat to himself or anyone else.

278
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,499
At this point?

279
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,890
Well, one does not become a
predatory stalker overnight, Jethro.

280
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:21,917
The mind typically goes
through three stages.

281
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:25,306
This letter, strange as it may
seem, is only at stage one...

282
00:15:25,787 --> 00:15:27,258
the attraction stage.

283
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,317
And the other two?

284
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,329
Well, on the surface this
letter, written by Andrew,

285
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,917
would appear more normal,

286
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:37,733
but phrases like "I
breathe for your words"

287
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:40,261
and "you need me", might suggest...

288
00:15:40,262 --> 00:15:41,822
Otherwise.

289
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:45,413
Yeah, because of that
sense of desperation,

290
00:15:45,414 --> 00:15:48,831
I categorized that
letter as stage two...

291
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:50,321
obsession.

292
00:15:50,322 --> 00:15:51,516
What's stage three?

293
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,667
Well, read for yourself.

294
00:15:56,752 --> 00:16:00,061
"I know you think of me
often, just as I think of you.

295
00:16:00,062 --> 00:16:03,008
Please don't make me do
something we'll both regret".

296
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:06,761
Now, that letter as an
aggressive, and threatening tone.

297
00:16:06,762 --> 00:16:10,271
For that reason, it falls
into the final stage...

298
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:12,733
destruction.

299
00:16:12,734 --> 00:16:15,137
Three letters. Three stages.

300
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:18,450
I know what you're thinking,
Jethro, but it's no coincidence.

301
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:21,198
Although the letters may
appear to be very different,

302
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,652
the writing style is nearly
identical in all three.

303
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:27,100
The same person wrote all three.

304
00:16:27,101 --> 00:16:30,666
And judging by the postmarks, the
letters were written and sent over

305
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:33,086
a period of several
weeks. During which time,

306
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:37,044
the writer became
increasingly delusional.

307
00:16:37,073 --> 00:16:38,200
Motive?

308
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:39,574
I can't say for certain,

309
00:16:39,575 --> 00:16:42,887
but I'd say the answers can
be found in Timothy's new book.

310
00:16:42,888 --> 00:16:44,631
The writer believes

311
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:49,116
that Timothy's fiction
is very much real.

312
00:17:03,912 --> 00:17:05,737
Tony, you about...

313
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:13,327
Done.

314
00:17:14,836 --> 00:17:15,862
So?

315
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:17,171
I'm confused.

316
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,264
This isn't a critique, okay?

317
00:17:20,265 --> 00:17:22,617
We're trying to find something useful...

318
00:17:23,456 --> 00:17:24,456
Confused by what?

319
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,905
The plot, the back story,

320
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:30,681
pretty much everything.

321
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,648
The whole thing doesn't make sense.

322
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,153
Ziva, what about you?

323
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,509
Not as confused as Tony.

324
00:17:39,176 --> 00:17:41,879
Well, I haven't finished it
yet. It's just a rough draft.

325
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,956
Very rough.

326
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,515
I'm sorry, McGee.

327
00:17:45,516 --> 00:17:47,268
Who's the killer, anyway?

328
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:48,434
I don't know yet.

329
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:51,745
It's your problem, I mean
you always have to know

330
00:17:51,746 --> 00:17:54,829
It's your problem where your story
is going. That's Fiction Writing 101.

331
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,612
Not the way I choose to write, Tony.

332
00:17:56,613 --> 00:17:59,268
And he wonders why
he has writer's block.

333
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:01,210
Can we focus on the problem here?

334
00:18:01,211 --> 00:18:04,579
We've got a missing person
and our only lead is my book.

335
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,229
Well, that's not much of a lead.

336
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,606
She's right. We don't even
know how the book factors in.

337
00:18:08,607 --> 00:18:10,082
We do now.

338
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,330
The letters were written
by the same person.

339
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:14,392
He thinks the book is real.

340
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,474
And believes Petty Officer
Cove is a part of it.

341
00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:21,350
It means we're going to have
to go everywhere he's been.

342
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:24,798
Well, we've already done that,
though. His home, work, hang out spots.

343
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,269
I'm not talking about
Petty Officer Cove.

344
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,039
I'm talking aboutyour good old
boy... with the pickup truck.

345
00:18:32,015 --> 00:18:33,331
Cameron Meyer.

346
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:36,544
High Side Creek, where
Cameron goes to clear his head.

347
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:39,714
Thematically, this location
is very important, boss.

348
00:18:39,715 --> 00:18:41,866
You've been saying the same
thing all morning, McGee.

349
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:42,867
Spread out.

350
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:45,479
Why would Cameron come
to a picnic area to think?

351
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,666
In his book, it's not a picnic
area. It's his favorite fishing hole.

352
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:51,519
- Thank you, Ziva.
- Don't you think it's kind of a cliché

353
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,394
to have your character alone,
staring into the serene wilderness?

354
00:18:56,395 --> 00:18:59,218
No. If it was, I wouldn't
have written it, Tony.

355
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:01,671
I mean, knowing Cameron,
if he was bummed out,

356
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:05,719
wouldn't he just go to the Wing Shack with
his buddies, and toss back a few brews?

357
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,364
Or talk to a priest?

358
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:10,407
Don't forget that he's very
religious, now that his father died.

359
00:19:10,408 --> 00:19:11,461
Good point.

360
00:19:11,462 --> 00:19:12,783
No, it isn't.

361
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:15,829
Cameron keeps his emotions bottled up.

362
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:19,518
When he's upset, he comes here.
Afterwards, he always feels better.

363
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:21,132
Not always.

364
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:34,958
That's him.

365
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,859
That's Petty Officer Cove.

366
00:19:38,962 --> 00:19:40,066
Then who is this?!

367
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,010
That's Jared Brenner.

368
00:19:54,453 --> 00:19:56,915
That's another character from my book.

369
00:20:06,813 --> 00:20:10,335
Two bodies, both with nearly identical

370
00:20:10,336 --> 00:20:12,845
stab wounds in the chest and abdomen.

371
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:17,673
It appears that Petty Officer Cove
may have put up a bit of a struggle.

372
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:22,208
Note the remnants of skin tissue
and blood under the fingernails.

373
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,782
Both men have been deceased
for less than 24 hours.

374
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,557
That is not all they
hav in commun, Ducky.

375
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:31,500
They're also both characters
in McGeek's next book.

376
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:34,939
Yes. From what I hear,
Timothy, in your next novel,

377
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,939
L.J. Tibbs has a love interest.

378
00:20:38,548 --> 00:20:41,350
Yes. I hear that it's an Army...

379
00:20:41,351 --> 00:20:43,585
Ducky, I don't think we
need to talk about that.

380
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:44,691
Army what?

381
00:20:45,314 --> 00:20:46,446
McGee?

382
00:20:50,097 --> 00:20:51,300
Lieutenant.

383
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,862
Colonel.

384
00:20:54,768 --> 00:20:56,069
Lieutenant colonel.

385
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:59,586
You got a murder weapon, Duck?

386
00:20:59,587 --> 00:21:02,298
Yes, well, that's where
things get interesting, Jethro.

387
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:06,784
Cove wounds are circular,
about one inch in diameter.

388
00:21:07,088 --> 00:21:08,088
- Javelin.
- Javelin.

389
00:21:08,469 --> 00:21:09,742
Chapter Four.

390
00:21:09,743 --> 00:21:11,755
My characters Cameron
Meyer and Jared Brenner...

391
00:21:11,756 --> 00:21:14,857
they murder a convenience store
clerk to cover up an extortion.

392
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,739
Javelin. Believe it or not.

393
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,535
That is for what they were
originally intended, Anthony.

394
00:21:20,903 --> 00:21:23,111
A javelin as a
modern-day murder weapon.

395
00:21:23,112 --> 00:21:26,521
I applaud your creativity, McGee.

396
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,897
Of course, well... given
the circumstances...

397
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:35,819
Oh, dear.

398
00:21:36,886 --> 00:21:39,603
Now I'm gonna have to read his new book.

399
00:21:40,197 --> 00:21:44,078
Petty Officer Darren Cove and
Adrian Corbett, the inspiration

400
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,285
behind two of McGee's characters:
Cameron Meyer and Jared Brenner.

401
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:50,520
- Any other connection?
- Not that we've found.

402
00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:53,150
Corbett worked as a valet
at Alfonso's Steakhouse.

403
00:21:53,164 --> 00:21:54,561
Your favorite.

404
00:21:54,844 --> 00:21:56,319
That's how I got to know him.

405
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,443
For my book, I borrowed his
physical details... the nose ring,

406
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,571
birthmark on the face and the neck.

407
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:03,190
What was his job?

408
00:22:03,629 --> 00:22:05,171
Valet at a steakhouse.

409
00:22:05,172 --> 00:22:07,072
But I did change the
name of the restaurant.

410
00:22:07,073 --> 00:22:09,126
From Alfonso's to Alfredo's.

411
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,630
Don't need to be Sherlock
Holmes to figure that one out.

412
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:13,659
The note from Petty
Officer Cove's apartment.

413
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,659
"One down, two to go". Means
the killer's not finished.

414
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,004
How many more of your characters
did you base on real people?

415
00:22:26,007 --> 00:22:27,144
How many?

416
00:22:29,762 --> 00:22:30,993
Just the team.

417
00:22:31,347 --> 00:22:33,775
You. Tony, Ziva, everyone.

418
00:22:34,723 --> 00:22:36,895
You happy, Tony? I finally admitted it.

419
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:39,726
- I based both my novels on you.
- That means we're all potential targets.

420
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:41,580
- Boss, I'm sorry.
- Ducky, Abby, Palmer...

421
00:22:41,581 --> 00:22:44,322
24-hour security detail
until we find this psycho.

422
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:47,385
27 javelins sold in the DC
area in the past six months.

423
00:22:47,386 --> 00:22:49,327
21 were paid for by credit cards,

424
00:22:49,762 --> 00:22:51,545
all by track coaches
and athletic directors.

425
00:22:51,546 --> 00:22:52,947
What about the last six?

426
00:22:52,948 --> 00:22:54,666
Cash transactions.

427
00:22:56,137 --> 00:22:58,147
<i>- Yeah. Gibbs.
- Got them for you, Gibbs.</i>

428
00:22:58,153 --> 00:23:00,491
Got it, Abs. We'll
be right down. Go, go.

429
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:03,335
Not you.

430
00:23:05,094 --> 00:23:07,187
Two men are dead because of me, boss.

431
00:23:07,188 --> 00:23:08,793
You got a javelin, McGee?

432
00:23:09,063 --> 00:23:10,788
No, but I own a typewriter.

433
00:23:12,105 --> 00:23:14,513
It's a typewriter, not a shotgun.

434
00:23:14,514 --> 00:23:18,900
It cost two men their lives because I
based my fictional book on real people.

435
00:23:19,183 --> 00:23:20,322
Then put these on.

436
00:23:22,955 --> 00:23:24,512
You just confessed, right?

437
00:23:24,513 --> 00:23:25,749
Not exactly.

438
00:23:26,117 --> 00:23:27,824
There's no mid ground, McGee.

439
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:30,700
You either put on the cuffs
or you find who's responsible.

440
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,810
- How?
- This guy's inside your head.

441
00:23:32,826 --> 00:23:35,077
- You get inside his!
- Boss, it's not that simple.

442
00:23:35,078 --> 00:23:37,941
- I still don't even know what my story is.
- You figure it out, McGee!

443
00:23:39,738 --> 00:23:43,315
You write the ending to
this or the killer will!

444
00:23:48,778 --> 00:23:50,389
Well, McGee feels bad enough.

445
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,742
Only makes it worse that he admitted it.

446
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,890
It was no secret he
was writing about us.

447
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,578
Oh, come on. It's not about us.

448
00:23:56,579 --> 00:23:59,328
I mean, the whole part about
Lisa and her broken heart.

449
00:23:59,682 --> 00:24:03,051
The moment she keeps from her relationship
that never had a chance to happen.

450
00:24:03,052 --> 00:24:06,520
Yeah, whe's he getting that? Or
the scene between Lisa and Tommy

451
00:24:06,521 --> 00:24:10,234
where they pool out their hearts to
each other and spill their secrets?

452
00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:14,915
When he tries to explain the
profound nature of his identity crise.

453
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:18,553
Yeah. I mean, the hidden struggle
between who he is and what he's becoming.

454
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,561
- I don't even know what that is.
- Yeah, totally unrealistic.

455
00:24:20,562 --> 00:24:22,150
Would never happen.

456
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:28,316
What do you got, Abs?

457
00:24:28,703 --> 00:24:29,891
Three hours sleep.

458
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:31,579
My apartment flooded last night.

459
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,905
Did you know tt trying to flush voodoo
dolls down the toilet is a bad idea?

460
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,164
I do now.

461
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:39,029
- Where's Gibbs?
- He's chomping up McGee.

462
00:24:39,284 --> 00:24:40,458
Chewing.

463
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:44,724
So a little birdie
told me that both of you

464
00:24:44,725 --> 00:24:46,875
have read the first
half of McGee's new book.

465
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:48,806
A little birdie?

466
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:53,037
And don't even ask because I will not
reveal my source even if you torture me.

467
00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:54,849
- Ducky?
- Yes!

468
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,027
All right, let's hear it.

469
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,320
Hear what?

470
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,925
The book. At the end of Deep Six,

471
00:25:00,926 --> 00:25:03,831
goth forensic specialist "Amy Sutton",

472
00:25:03,832 --> 00:25:06,995
she broke up with her boyfriend
because she was digging somebody else.

473
00:25:07,745 --> 00:25:09,514
Who's the somebody else?

474
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
Oh, yeah...

475
00:25:12,434 --> 00:25:14,928
Yeah, that part really
didn't come up yet.

476
00:25:15,193 --> 00:25:17,733
Yeah, I think he's
planning on revealing it,

477
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,615
you know, the second part of the book.

478
00:25:21,505 --> 00:25:23,797
You guys are so lying.

479
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:26,826
He's gay!

480
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,656
The somebody else! I had a feeling

481
00:25:29,657 --> 00:25:32,972
'cause Amy always wants
what Amy cannot have.

482
00:25:33,348 --> 00:25:35,461
- Does she know?
- Know what?

483
00:25:35,462 --> 00:25:38,428
Forensic specialist Amy, she fell
in love with a gay guy, Gibbs.

484
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:40,326
- That why I'm here?
- No.

485
00:25:40,524 --> 00:25:42,420
Then Amy's on her own.

486
00:25:42,817 --> 00:25:44,232
We'll talk later.

487
00:25:44,968 --> 00:25:47,223
I ran the blood samples that
we pulled off the two bodies.

488
00:25:47,224 --> 00:25:51,985
Petty Officer Cove had unidentified
lood on his right forearm and hand.

489
00:25:53,142 --> 00:25:55,084
It matched the blood from his house.

490
00:25:55,085 --> 00:25:56,349
Our killer's DNA.

491
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,250
I'm no investigator,
but odds a you're right.

492
00:25:58,251 --> 00:26:00,458
- That's good work, Abs.
- I also checked

493
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:06,078
Petty Officer Cove's Gord Ranger and
Thom E. Gemcity's c-mail for prints.

494
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:09,094
- C- mail? - Yeah,
it's like cuckoo mail.

495
00:26:09,095 --> 00:26:12,183
No, no, no, I just made it
up. Nothing on the truck.

496
00:26:12,184 --> 00:26:14,842
All the latent prints
belong to Petty Officer Cove.

497
00:26:14,843 --> 00:26:17,651
But on the c-mail, there's
dozens of different prints.

498
00:26:17,652 --> 00:26:21,273
Well, that makes sense 'cause paper
mail gets processed through post offices,

499
00:26:21,274 --> 00:26:23,296
- delivery trucks, mailrooms.
- Exactly.

500
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:28,554
The's still one spot that
only the sender touches.

501
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,968
The back of the stamp.
You pulled a print?

502
00:26:31,969 --> 00:26:35,451
Not only did I pull a
print, I already got a match.

503
00:26:41,715 --> 00:26:45,185
Todd Ryder, arrested last year
for possession of marijuana.

504
00:27:13,643 --> 00:27:15,752
Looking for something Timothy?

505
00:27:19,155 --> 00:27:20,589
I'm just looking.

506
00:27:22,096 --> 00:27:23,674
Petty Officer Cove...

507
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,314
.. wasn't just a partier.

508
00:27:26,315 --> 00:27:28,350
I called his elderly parents.

509
00:27:28,591 --> 00:27:30,959
Visited them every day for two hours.

510
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:33,904
This guy,

511
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,875
Adrian Corbett,

512
00:27:37,894 --> 00:27:39,642
he just got married.

513
00:27:41,096 --> 00:27:42,096
Yes,

514
00:27:42,642 --> 00:27:44,719
I took off his wedding ring.

515
00:27:46,425 --> 00:27:49,656
Not quite the notorious
playboy I made him out to be?

516
00:27:49,657 --> 00:27:51,362
Appearances can be deceptive.

517
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:54,401
Every single word I wrote was wrong.

518
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:56,941
No, every word you wrote was fiction.

519
00:27:57,846 --> 00:28:00,140
That's why they call them "characters".

520
00:28:00,141 --> 00:28:02,632
But they are not just
characters in book.

521
00:28:03,033 --> 00:28:04,327
They're real people...

522
00:28:05,286 --> 00:28:06,749
and real families.

523
00:28:09,222 --> 00:28:10,222
Were.

524
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:18,502
I sympathize with the
way you feel, Timothy...

525
00:28:23,308 --> 00:28:26,187
...but you are not to
blame for any of this.

526
00:28:29,223 --> 00:28:30,223
Tell them that.

527
00:28:38,657 --> 00:28:39,917
Todd!

528
00:28:41,743 --> 00:28:43,036
Oh, God.

529
00:28:44,714 --> 00:28:45,762
Look out!

530
00:28:45,763 --> 00:28:47,099
What do you call that?

531
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,280
Running, I think.

532
00:28:52,383 --> 00:28:54,081
Todd! Hey!

533
00:28:55,581 --> 00:28:56,662
Where's his car?

534
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,203
Where's his car?!

535
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,196
Employee lot around back.

536
00:29:02,259 --> 00:29:04,784
Get out of the building! They know!

537
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,154
They're chasing me!

538
00:29:10,261 --> 00:29:11,888
You should've left the top down.

539
00:29:13,261 --> 00:29:14,846
Put your hands on top of your head.

540
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:18,985
Nice of you to join us, DiNozzo.

541
00:29:20,312 --> 00:29:22,465
I thought I was gaining ground.

542
00:29:22,466 --> 00:29:24,644
He got a very unorthodox running style.

543
00:29:24,645 --> 00:29:26,538
It's very effective, though.

544
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:28,062
Not effective enough.

545
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,184
I didn't want to do it.

546
00:29:30,425 --> 00:29:32,250
I told her it was a bad idea.

547
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,326
I actually trusted her.

548
00:29:42,327 --> 00:29:44,375
There was no way you
could have known, McGee.

549
00:29:44,376 --> 00:29:46,950
Ziva's right, probie,
it's not your fault.

550
00:29:47,545 --> 00:29:50,578
But if you evenn think about
writing a third novel, I'll kill you.

551
00:29:50,861 --> 00:29:53,664
When Abby finds out who her
character really fell in love with,

552
00:29:54,103 --> 00:29:55,957
you will already be dead.

553
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:03,171
I have been sitting here
half the night, Agent Gibbs.

554
00:30:03,681 --> 00:30:05,152
What am I beg charged with?

555
00:30:05,153 --> 00:30:07,484
Tampering with a federal investigation.

556
00:30:07,485 --> 00:30:09,725
That's ridiculous. I've answered
every question you've asked.

557
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:10,852
Resisting arrest.

558
00:30:11,322 --> 00:30:13,713
I told you already, I wasn't running.

559
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,645
I was late for an appointment.

560
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:16,730
And murder.

561
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:21,305
You think I murdered someone.

562
00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:27,412
Their names are Petty Officer
Darren Cove and Adrian Corbett.

563
00:30:27,918 --> 00:30:29,161
Never heard of them.

564
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,874
Okay.

565
00:30:31,557 --> 00:30:35,282
Well, how about Cameron
Meyer and Jared Brenner?

566
00:30:35,613 --> 00:30:37,776
- Have you heard of them?
- I think so.

567
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,378
They're characters in Tim's next book.

568
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,996
A book someone is killing over.

569
00:30:43,997 --> 00:30:45,631
Too bad you can't findthem.

570
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:47,106
I think we have.

571
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,120
- You wrote the letters.
- What?! Why would I...?

572
00:30:51,121 --> 00:30:52,549
Todd gave you up.

573
00:30:52,861 --> 00:30:57,255
He said you told him to mail
the letters back to the agency.

574
00:31:02,604 --> 00:31:03,849
Well, I can explain.

575
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,311
Well, I sure hope so.

576
00:31:06,312 --> 00:31:10,410
I wrote the letters, but
only to create a bigger buzz.

577
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:13,763
Stalkers mean more press. More
press means increased revenue.

578
00:31:15,136 --> 00:31:17,740
You made up a stalker
to sell more books?

579
00:31:17,995 --> 00:31:19,358
Yes, I did.

580
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:22,486
She's lying.

581
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:24,866
If she is, she's quiet good.

582
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:27,823
She publishes fictional
novels for a living, Ziva.

583
00:31:27,824 --> 00:31:29,762
She knows how to tell a good story.

584
00:31:30,215 --> 00:31:31,899
I'm with Ziva.

585
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:34,604
This woman lives to sell books.

586
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:37,420
Look, it may sound unorthodox,
but I do one interview

587
00:31:37,421 --> 00:31:40,200
about those letters and Gemcity's
book sales jump to the roof.

588
00:31:40,201 --> 00:31:41,678
I didn't think he needed that help.

589
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,905
Well, there's no such
thing as enough sales.

590
00:31:46,631 --> 00:31:51,309
What I did might be wrong, but there's
no way I could ever kill anyone.

591
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,019
Why should I believe you?

592
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,542
Those letters were a
strategic business move.

593
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:03,363
I would do anything to help
my client sell more books.

594
00:32:04,452 --> 00:32:05,868
Anything.

595
00:32:08,245 --> 00:32:10,459
Well played, boss. You
get her in round two?

596
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:12,977
I won't be a round two, DiNozzo.

597
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:15,410
- She didn't break.
- I know. I was there.

598
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:17,150
She didn't do it, did she?

599
00:32:17,151 --> 00:32:19,424
She's your publisher. You tell me.

600
00:32:19,952 --> 00:32:21,932
I think she's telling the truth.

601
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:23,349
That makes two of us.

602
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:27,917
I compared Crawhaw's DNA to the mystery
blood pulled off of Petty Officer Cove.

603
00:32:28,144 --> 00:32:29,389
She did not do it.

604
00:32:37,994 --> 00:32:40,438
I read this a thounsand time
and I have come up with nothing.

605
00:32:40,648 --> 00:32:43,450
Then maybe we should spitball
ideas and see what sticks.

606
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:47,802
What? Did I say it wrong?

607
00:32:47,803 --> 00:32:49,231
No, you got that right.

608
00:32:49,232 --> 00:32:51,967
No, that's good. So
start with what we know.

609
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:53,579
Campfire.

610
00:32:54,569 --> 00:32:56,805
Well, we know there's
killer on the loose.

611
00:32:56,806 --> 00:32:59,804
One down, two to go. And he's
already killed number two.

612
00:32:59,805 --> 00:33:04,142
In your book, Cameron Meyer and Jared
Brenneronly have two things in common.

613
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:06,928
They extorted money and both
murded a convenience store clerk.

614
00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:09,418
Maybe the killer was seeking
revenge for the clerk's death.

615
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:12,632
No. The clerk's a throway character.
I didn't even bother to name him.

616
00:33:12,633 --> 00:33:15,768
Besides, the stalker letters are fake, so
we don't even know that he's delusional.

617
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:18,799
He murdered two characters
from a work of fiction, McGee.

618
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,432
Ok, so he's probably delusional,

619
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,131
but that doesn't mean
he's looking for revenge.

620
00:33:23,132 --> 00:33:24,755
You've got to have a motive, probie.

621
00:33:24,756 --> 00:33:27,278
Well, I am not convinced that
the answer is in my book, Tony.

622
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,038
Maybe the answer is
in how he got the book.

623
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,938
He dinitely didn't get it from Crawshaw.

624
00:33:31,939 --> 00:33:34,257
She'd never do anything
to jeopardize sales.

625
00:33:34,258 --> 00:33:35,905
It means he got it from you.

626
00:33:36,199 --> 00:33:38,538
- But I keep everything locked up.
- It wasn't a question.

627
00:33:38,797 --> 00:33:41,118
It's you or Crawshaw.

628
00:33:41,797 --> 00:33:44,828
Trust your instincts,
Tim. They're usually right.

629
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:47,229
Take the lead on this one.
All we can do is assist.

630
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:49,351
Okay.

631
00:33:51,361 --> 00:33:52,648
From the beginning...

632
00:33:54,678 --> 00:33:55,758
page one.

633
00:34:00,763 --> 00:34:04,705
I'd say we played that one nicely, boss.
The whole good guy, bad guy technique.

634
00:34:04,706 --> 00:34:06,134
- DiNozzo.
- Yeah?

635
00:34:06,714 --> 00:34:07,775
Assist.

636
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,185
Hold the elevator!

637
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:21,952
I am using muscle I
didn't even know I had.

638
00:34:21,953 --> 00:34:24,248
No wonder you only got to chapter six.

639
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:26,514
Chapter seven.

640
00:34:32,701 --> 00:34:34,946
It's jazz. Helps me clear my mind.

641
00:34:35,937 --> 00:34:37,309
Coltrane is jazz, McGee.

642
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:41,926
This is a soundtrack to a bad '70s
porno shot in the San Fernando Valley.

643
00:34:41,927 --> 00:34:44,983
I'm just trying to reenact every
detail of my writing process here, okay?

644
00:34:44,984 --> 00:34:48,469
I'm sorry, did you say something?
My ears are bleeding and I can't...

645
00:34:48,907 --> 00:34:50,136
I can't...

646
00:34:50,804 --> 00:34:51,977
Thank you.

647
00:34:51,978 --> 00:34:53,997
I'm trying to show you
what I do when I get stuck.

648
00:34:53,998 --> 00:34:55,575
Blocked. Whatever.

649
00:34:56,085 --> 00:34:57,259
Up. Come on.

650
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,745
- I'm in the middle.
- Up.

651
00:35:02,516 --> 00:35:03,695
Okay.

652
00:35:04,275 --> 00:35:08,238
Now, sometimes when I'm in trouble,
I take a few minutes to free write.

653
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:10,174
Free write?

654
00:35:10,816 --> 00:35:12,363
Stream of consciousness.

655
00:35:12,726 --> 00:35:16,299
About my characters, my story
arcs, my possible plotines,

656
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,659
- everything... no filter.
- No filter...

657
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,248
Whatever pops in my head
goes right to the page.

658
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:24,758
Write... be free. Just do it.

659
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:26,682
Free write!

660
00:35:27,424 --> 00:35:28,517
Be free...

661
00:35:29,674 --> 00:35:30,763
I get it.

662
00:35:32,178 --> 00:35:34,556
If I like it, I put it in my binder.

663
00:35:35,136 --> 00:35:36,517
If not...

664
00:35:39,351 --> 00:35:41,223
You always use your shredder?

665
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:42,265
Always.

666
00:35:43,795 --> 00:35:47,192
You ever just take a stack of
pages and toss it in the trash?

667
00:35:47,193 --> 00:35:49,850
- Never.
- You ever misplaced a binder or

668
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:51,517
lost a copy of a book?

669
00:35:51,518 --> 00:35:53,193
No and no.

670
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:55,513
The only way the killer got my book

671
00:35:55,514 --> 00:35:59,102
is if he broke into my apartment,
made a copy and returned the original.

672
00:35:59,103 --> 00:36:01,380
I'm a federal investigator
so I'm sure I would know

673
00:36:01,381 --> 00:36:04,097
if someone was trying
to break into my place.

674
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,743
We're missing something.

675
00:36:07,224 --> 00:36:08,550
While we are trying to figure it out,

676
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:11,286
he is planning on how
to kill his next victim.

677
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,791
Or he's already killed them.

678
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:17,484
Sorry. I was just free thinking.

679
00:36:19,422 --> 00:36:23,520
It's like he's here in the room with
me looking over my shoulder as I write.

680
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:24,521
Type.

681
00:36:27,163 --> 00:36:30,565
'Cause technically, what you do is type.
You don't really write. That would be...

682
00:36:31,032 --> 00:36:32,368
I type.

683
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:35,564
That's how he does it.

684
00:36:36,021 --> 00:36:37,798
Looked over your shoulder?

685
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,034
I type.

686
00:36:42,038 --> 00:36:43,255
Tony, I type!

687
00:36:46,015 --> 00:36:47,118
Boss, I got it.

688
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,420
Film?

689
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:50,081
It's from my typewriter.

690
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,805
- Typewriter ribbons.
- It's how the killer read my book.

691
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:56,312
- Well, where did he get theibbons?
- Trash.

692
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,800
The killer must have picked
them out of McGee's Dumpster.

693
00:36:59,018 --> 00:37:01,902
Means he had access o
all my notes and my ideas.

694
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,840
Which means the murdersmay
not be based on just the book.

695
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,642
All these pages are a
product of my free writing.

696
00:37:07,777 --> 00:37:09,587
- Free writing?
- I'll explain it later.

697
00:37:09,697 --> 00:37:12,072
And one of my many possible
endings involved Cameron Meyer

698
00:37:12,192 --> 00:37:14,116
and Jared Brenner killing me...

699
00:37:14,117 --> 00:37:17,518
Agent McGregor. It's a
character I based on myself.

700
00:37:17,627 --> 00:37:21,170
If the killer's confusing fiction
with reality, then you've got a motive.

701
00:37:21,293 --> 00:37:22,646
He's protecting you.

702
00:37:23,261 --> 00:37:25,967
He's already killed two of the
characters... who's the third?

703
00:37:26,937 --> 00:37:28,478
I haven't decided yet, but

704
00:37:28,584 --> 00:37:32,141
Meyer and Enner are the only characters
that wanted me... McGregor... dead.

705
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,959
Then why does he think there are three?

706
00:37:34,068 --> 00:37:36,540
I don't know. I decided it
would be stupid to kill McGregor.

707
00:37:36,704 --> 00:37:39,055
- Everyone likes him too much.
- Well, not everyone.

708
00:37:39,178 --> 00:37:41,614
"Forensic Specialist Amy
Sutton offered her heart

709
00:37:41,733 --> 00:37:43,317
"to Agent MsGregor, only to be rejected.

710
00:37:43,426 --> 00:37:45,581
"Using sign language,
she tells her deaf mother

711
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:48,018
"that she can't live without him.

712
00:37:48,244 --> 00:37:49,743
He's going to have to go".

713
00:37:50,745 --> 00:37:53,250
Yeah, "go", as in leave the
agency. Not "go" as in go.

714
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,474
Does the killer know that?

715
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:57,526
Abby?

716
00:37:57,926 --> 00:37:59,430
She's not answering her cellphone.

717
00:37:59,553 --> 00:38:00,694
Security detail.

718
00:38:00,797 --> 00:38:03,252
Shift change. They just arrived
on duty outside her apartment.

719
00:38:03,253 --> 00:38:04,999
- She's gone.
- She's not answering

720
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,859
- her home phone either, Gibbs.
- Send them in.

721
00:38:06,982 --> 00:38:08,157
Secure the apartment.

722
00:38:08,294 --> 00:38:10,647
No, she's not there.
Her apartment's flooded.

723
00:38:10,648 --> 00:38:12,532
She's staying with Sister
Rosita and the girls.

724
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:13,685
Sister Rosita?

725
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:15,297
From her bowling team.

726
00:38:15,423 --> 00:38:16,722
The bowling nuns.

727
00:38:45,745 --> 00:38:46,829
Hi, Amy.

728
00:38:48,971 --> 00:38:51,286
- Still no answer.
- Call again, McGee.

729
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:52,795
I can't believe I let this happen.

730
00:38:52,899 --> 00:38:54,757
Abby knows how to take
care of herself, McGee.

731
00:38:54,867 --> 00:38:56,980
And she's got a crew of
nuns watching herback.


732
00:38:57,089 --> 00:39:00,030
Nuns are on a spiritual
retreat. She's on her own.

733
00:39:02,225 --> 00:39:05,041
Are you... here to see someone?

734
00:39:07,105 --> 00:39:09,934
I'm... because the
sisters, they're gone...

735
00:39:10,344 --> 00:39:11,929
for a minute.

736
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,099
They went to the church and
they shod be back any time.

737
00:39:16,429 --> 00:39:17,832
If you were smart...

738
00:39:20,283 --> 00:39:22,519
you would've just let him go, Amy.

739
00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:26,062
My name's Abby.

740
00:39:27,702 --> 00:39:29,626
I know rejection is hard.

741
00:39:30,886 --> 00:39:34,674
But let's face it, you're not
good enough for him anyway.

742
00:39:37,435 --> 00:39:38,979
Good enough for who?

743
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,054
Special Agent McGregor.

744
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:50,076
You two take the back.
McGee, you're with me.

745
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:55,827
I'm sure there's some sort
of communication problem here.

746
00:39:55,956 --> 00:39:57,974
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.

747
00:40:01,812 --> 00:40:03,315
I know what you said.

748
00:40:03,821 --> 00:40:05,625
That makes one of us.

749
00:40:07,101 --> 00:40:08,981
How were you planning to do it?

750
00:40:09,479 --> 00:40:10,594
Do what?

751
00:40:11,092 --> 00:40:12,285
Kill him.

752
00:40:13,362 --> 00:40:14,455
Was it poison?

753
00:40:14,851 --> 00:40:16,853
I bet with your forensic traing,

754
00:40:17,093 --> 00:40:20,050
I bet you could come up
with something pretty...

755
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,088
I wouldn't do that.

756
00:40:31,821 --> 00:40:33,096
I will say

757
00:40:34,077 --> 00:40:36,385
I've always respected your courage, Amy.

758
00:40:38,423 --> 00:40:39,913
Drop your weapon!

759
00:40:40,693 --> 00:40:42,606
He said drop it! Now!

760
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:44,930
Officer Lisa...

761
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:46,624
Agent Tommy.

762
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,561
I'm afraid I can't do that.

763
00:40:52,231 --> 00:40:53,580
You don't know it yet,

764
00:40:53,926 --> 00:40:55,943
but your partner's in danger.

765
00:40:58,308 --> 00:40:59,525
Landon?

766
00:41:01,643 --> 00:41:03,023
Landon, what are you doing?

767
00:41:03,132 --> 00:41:04,212
I'm protecting you.

768
00:41:05,008 --> 00:41:06,812
McGee, who is this guy?

769
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,098
He's a friend.

770
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:09,910
Don't!

771
00:41:11,992 --> 00:41:13,236
I have to do this!

772
00:41:13,782 --> 00:41:15,851
Landon, she's not going to hurt me.

773
00:41:17,992 --> 00:41:19,048
It's just a book.

774
00:41:19,049 --> 00:41:20,812
- It's not...
- Finished yet.

775
00:41:24,598 --> 00:41:27,113
Tell him the ending, Agent McGregor.

776
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:30,489
Tell him what happens.

777
00:41:39,073 --> 00:41:40,559
It's not what you think.

778
00:41:40,928 --> 00:41:41,975
Landon...

779
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:46,435
Amy and I...

780
00:41:49,606 --> 00:41:51,260
Amy and I get married.

781
00:41:55,328 --> 00:41:58,061
You... you marry her?

782
00:41:58,608 --> 00:42:00,959
Yeah, I do.

783
00:42:01,424 --> 00:42:02,688
That means that if you kill her,

784
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:05,383
you're killing the
only woman I ever loved.

785
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:09,986
Landon, I really do love her.

786
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:13,394
It just took me a
while to figure it out.

787
00:42:33,826 --> 00:42:35,289
I was only trying to help.

788
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,095
You killed two people.

789
00:42:37,423 --> 00:42:38,694
I had no choice.

790
00:42:41,386 --> 00:42:42,739
They set a wedding date yet?

791
