This letter,strange as it may seem,

is only at stage one-- the attraction stage.

336
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,700
would appear more normal,
看上去正常些

337
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,600
but phrases like "I breathe for your words"

338
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,220
and "you need me,"

339
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,120
might suggest...

不要逼我做出讓雙方都後悔的事"

347
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,590
Now,that letter has an aggressive, and thatening tone.
現在 這封信帶著挑釁和威脅的語氣

348
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,050

but it's no coincidence.

the writing style is nearly identical in all three.

And judging by the postmarks,

Well,I can't say for certain,
呃 我不能肯定

The whole thing doesn't make sense.

Who's the killer,anyway?

Not the way I choose to write,Tony.

And he wonders why he has writer's block.

Can we focus on the problem here?

有人失蹤了 唯一線索就是我的書

Well,that's not much of a lead.
這可算不上什麼唯一線索

She's right. We don't even know how the book factors in.

我為什麼要相信你呢?

688
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:49,790
Those letters were a strategic business move.
這些信件不過是商業舉措

689
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:54,040
I would do anything to help my client sell more books.
為了替客戶售出更多圖書我會不擇手段

690
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,770
Anything.
不擇手段

691
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,250
<i>Well played,boss. You get her in round two?
幹得好 頭 你打算第二輪就讓她招供?</i>

692
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,030
I won't be around to,DiNozzo.
沒有什麼第二輪 DiNozzo

693
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,050
She didn't break.
她沒有崩潰

694
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:04,670
I know.
我知道

695
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,650
I was there.

She didn't do it,did she?

697
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,510
She's your publisher.

698
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,590
You tell me.
你說呢

00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,860
I think she's telling the truth.
我認為她吐露的是實情

700
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,470
That makes two of us.
我跟你一樣想法

701
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:18,350
I compared Crawhaw's DNA to the mystery blood pulled off of Petty Officer Cove.
我把Crawhaw的DNA 和Cove士官那裡找到的神秘血液做了對比

702
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,660
She did not do it.
不是她幹的

703
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,850
I've read this a thousand times and I've come up with nothing.
我已經讀了一千遍了 還是一無所獲

704
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,700
Then maybe we should spitball ideas and see what sticks.
也許應該再多思考下 看哪個站得住腳

705
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,990
What?

706
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,200
Did I say it wrong?

No,you got that right.
不 你說得對

708
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,520
No,that's good.

709
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,190
So start with what we know.
從我們已知的信息入手

710
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,540
Campfire.
營火會開始

711
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,060
Well,we know there's a killer on the loose.
現在我們知道兇手在逃

712
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,410
One down,two to go.

713
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,080
And he's already killed number two.
他已經謀殺了第二號角色

714
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,420
In your book,Cameron Meyer and Jared Brenner only have two things in common.
在你的書裡 Cameron Meyer 和Jared Brenner只有兩個共同點

715
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,170
They extorted money and both murdered a convenience store clerk.
搶劫錢財 殺死便利商店店員

716
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,580
Maybe the killer was seeking revenge for the clerk's death.
也許殺手想為死去的店員報仇雪恨

717
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,310
No. The clerk's a throwaway character.
不 店員不過是個一閃而過的角色

718
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,750
I didn't even bother to name him.
我甚至都沒給他起名字

719
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,380
Besides,the stalker letters are fake,
另外 跟蹤狂的信件也是假的

720
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,070
so we don't even know that he's delusional.
所以甚至搞不清楚他是否有在妄想

721
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:07,070
He murdered two characters from a work of fiction,McGee.
他根據虛構的作品謀殺了兩個角色 McGee

722
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:09,690
Okay,so he's probably delusional,
好吧 他多半有妄想

723
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,480
but that doesn mean he's looking for revenge.
但並不代表他在伺機報復

724
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,920
You've got to have a motive,probie.
得找出動機 菜鳥

725
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,500
Well,I am not convinced that the answer is in my book,Tony.
我不相信答案在我書裡 Tony

726
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,200
Maybe the answer is in how he got the book.
也許答案在於他怎樣弄到你的書

727
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,480
Heefinitely didn't get it from Crawshaw.
他肯定不是從Crawshaw那裡弄到的

728
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,510
She'd never do anything to jeopardize sales.
她絕不會做出有損銷量的事

729
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,250
It means he got it from you.
也就是說他從你那裡弄到的書

730
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,500
But I keep everything locked up.
可是我把一切都鎖了起來

731
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,970
It wasn't a question.

732
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,440
It's you or Crawshaw.

733
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,570
Trust your instincts,Tim.

Take the lead on this one.

我不過是在重演寫作過程的詳細步驟 行了嗎?
