1
00:00:04,182 --> 00:00:06,272
Retesting evasive driving techniques.

2
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:07,785
Third time's the charm,Otto.

3
00:00:08,623 --> 00:00:09,228
You can do it.

4
00:00:21,953 --> 00:00:23,163
Give me a 180,Otto.

5
00:00:27,055 --> 00:00:29,199
Yes! Didn't touch a
single cone on that run.

6
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:31,248
I would call that a pass,baby.

7
00:00:31,372 --> 00:00:32,211
Phase two.

8
00:00:33,077 --> 00:00:34,418
This one's for you,Torsten.

9
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:35,672
Go for it,Otto.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,179
Make me proud.

11
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:40,917
Avoiding civilian casualties

12
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:42,211
during high-speed egress.

13
00:00:49,403 --> 00:00:49,953
Oops.

14
00:00:51,372 --> 00:00:52,631
Sorry about that,Torsten.

15
00:00:55,761 --> 00:00:58,082
Need to recalibrate the
braking-to-surface algorithm.

16
00:00:58,302 --> 00:00:59,248
That was my fault,Otto.

17
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:00,579
Not yours.

18
00:01:01,096 --> 00:01:02,031
Test concluded.

19
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:03,680
Take me home,Otto.

20
00:01:16,057 --> 00:01:16,849
Ooh...

21
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:18,730
Still a few bugs to work out,

22
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,922
but Otto and I are
both feeling much better

23
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:22,348
about the drive-off next week.

24
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,631
Oh,note for Jamie- fuel
pressuge is fluctuating.

25
00:01:30,442 --> 00:01:33,599
Malfunction in the
electrical system at 0638.

26
00:01:33,896 --> 00:01:35,502
Initiating software shutdown.

27
00:01:41,662 --> 00:01:42,729
Exhaust in the cabin.

28
00:01:43,422 --> 00:01:44,530
Otto's core is frozen.

29
00:01:44,764 --> 00:01:45,919
I'm hitting the kill switch.

30
00:01:50,763 --> 00:01:52,534
Come on... Come on!

31
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:55,063
I'm trapped in the ca...

32
00:02:50,405 --> 00:02:50,955
Lights,please.

33
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,232
From the video presentation,

34
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:55,106
it's clear that sexual harassment

35
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:57,241
can take many forms in the workplace.

36
00:02:57,681 --> 00:02:58,516
A coworker with

37
00:02:58,703 --> 00:03:01,046
elevator eyes looking you up and down,

38
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:04,197
a coworker shows you a cartoon or

39
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,187
photo of a sexual nature.

40
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,100
If you're lucky.

41
00:03:07,243 --> 00:03:09,910
A coworker's hand accidentally

42
00:03:10,537 --> 00:03:12,121
brushes up against your body.

43
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:13,534
If you're really lucky.

44
00:03:13,688 --> 00:03:14,612
Physical contact

45
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:17,185
can be divided into three categories.

46
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:20,341
Green light includes normal behavior.

47
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,903
Yellow light includes

48
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:25,296
borderline behaviors such
as hugging someone or...

49
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:27,265
Yep?

50
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:28,650
What's wrong with hugging people?

51
00:03:28,694 --> 00:03:29,992
I hug people all the time.

52
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:31,334
You may see it as friendly,

53
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:33,033
but your coworkers
may find it offensive.

54
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:36,008
You guys get offended when I hug you?

55
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:37,393
No. No. No.

56
00:03:37,463 --> 00:03:38,733
Of course not,Abby.

57
00:03:39,411 --> 00:03:41,732
I'm hugging you all
in my mind right now.

58
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:42,936
D.O.D. policy

59
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:44,960
is very clear about this point,Miss.

60
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:46,666
You must first ask permission

61
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,050
before making physical contact

62
00:03:48,051 --> 00:03:48,677
with a coworker.

63
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:50,723
Like,every time?

64
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:52,081
Yes.

65
00:03:52,114 --> 00:03:54,132
And finally,there's red light behavior,

66
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,771
such as deliberate,

67
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:57,646
unwelcomed touching.

68
00:04:01,984 --> 00:04:03,161

Another question?

69
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,008
Yeah,

70
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:06,488
what if you slap someone in
the back of the head like this?

71
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:10,128
Would that be considered
inappropriate behavior?

72
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,085
Absolutely.

73
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:13,120
Are you saying that this
has actually happened?

74
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:18,547
No,I was just wondering, that's all.

75
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:19,823
Yes?

76
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,419
Uh,yes,uh,what if part of your job...

77
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:23,892
Gibbs.

78
00:04:24,145 --> 00:04:26,784
includes... touching naked people

79
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:29,143
- ... and...
- That's inappropriate at any time.

80
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:30,793
Even if they're dead?

81
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:34,906
Why are you touching dead,naked people?

82
00:04:35,412 --> 00:04:37,155
You see,I work in autopsy...

83
00:04:37,553 --> 00:04:39,346
Can we try to keep this discussion

84
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:40,900
focused on the topic...

85
00:04:41,054 --> 00:04:41,563
Gear up.

86
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:43,978
Navy lieutenant's been found dead

87
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,546
in an R & D facility in Fairfax.

88
00:04:45,547 --> 00:04:46,750
Wait,I can't

89
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,207
mark you as attending
unless you're here for...

90
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,517
Uh,Ms. Taylor.

91
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:51,593
I will take excellent notes for them.

92
00:04:56,404 --> 00:04:56,987
Okay...

93
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:00,804
Ducky won't be here.

94
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:02,822
He's got to take his
mom to the hospital.

95
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:04,263
Is Victoria all right?

96
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,099
Well,she cut herself
shaving, and for some reason,

97
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,651
he thinks you can handle this,Palmer.

98
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,462
Uh... what do you think, Agent Gibbs?

99
00:05:13,006 --> 00:05:14,699
Well,I don't know,Palmer.

100
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,195
- You got me a T.O.D.?
- Yes.

101
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:18,950
Uh,according to the
liver probe,she died...

102
00:05:19,368 --> 00:05:21,425
two hours and 18 minutes ago.

103
00:05:21,507 --> 00:05:22,651
Does it tell you how?

104
00:05:23,234 --> 00:05:24,526
Actually,the probe only

105
00:05:24,527 --> 00:05:26,902
tells you the difference between
ambient temperature and...

106
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:28,902
But you already know all this.

107
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:31,736
Tentatively,I'd say
she died from hypoxia,

108
00:05:31,737 --> 00:05:32,404
Agent Gibbs.

109
00:05:32,488 --> 00:05:34,104
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

110
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,204
Yeah,most likely.

111
00:05:35,578 --> 00:05:37,541
In 68% of cases, it's accidental.

112
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:40,856
And,uh,the other 29%
are self-inflicted.

113
00:05:40,857 --> 00:05:43,205
Well,I'm more concerned with
the three percent you left out.

114
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:44,305
Palmer,he's talking about the ones

115
00:05:44,306 --> 00:05:45,833
deliberately murdered this way.

116
00:05:46,218 --> 00:05:47,318
How'd she get on the floor.

117
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:49,171
Coworker found her
in the passenger seat,

118
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:52,233
in there,doors still closed
and the engine running.

119
00:05:52,234 --> 00:05:54,329
He drove it out,attempted CPR.

120
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,440
Tony's taking a statement now.

121
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:57,409
What kind of vehicle is this?

122
00:05:58,315 --> 00:06:00,251
It is a second generation

123
00:06:00,252 --> 00:06:02,863
fully autonomous AI
- operated vehicle,boss.

124
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:05,342
Well,yeah. Yeah,I can see that,McGee.

125
00:06:05,343 --> 00:06:06,751
I mean,other than the obvious.

126
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:07,092
Wait,

127
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:08,933
you actually understood that?

128
00:06:09,347 --> 00:06:10,270
You know what it does then?

129
00:06:11,392 --> 00:06:13,778
Yeah,your basic second generation...

130
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:14,801
AI...


131
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:16,957
autonomous stuff.

132
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,745
Where the hell does the driver sit?

133
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,747
That's the point. There isn't one.

134
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:25,968
It drives itself.

135
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:28,937
Boss,"AI" stands for
artificial intelligence.

136
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:31,170
It's a robot.

137
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:34,506
<i>All I'm saying,Agent DiNozzo</i>

138
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:36,932
is our entire team is under a tremendous

139
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:37,988
amount of stress.

140
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,441
We're competing against dozens of teams.

141
00:06:40,463 --> 00:06:41,937
Three and a half years of work,

142
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:45,219
and it all comes down to a
single proof of concept test.

143
00:06:45,494 --> 00:06:46,550
Robot car race.

144
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:49,080
In crude terms,yes.

145
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:50,041
What do you get if you win?

146
00:06:50,263 --> 00:06:51,845
Recognition in my field.

147
00:06:53,268 --> 00:06:54,849
What about one of
those cool trophies like

148
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,256
they hand out at NASCAR?

149
00:06:56,926 --> 00:06:57,641
I wouldn't know.

150
00:06:57,642 --> 00:06:59,918
I'm a scientist,not a redneck.

151
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,238
It is the fastest-growing
sport in the country.

152
00:07:02,513 --> 00:07:03,525
I rest my case.

153
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:04,916
In my opinion,

154
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:06,192
it's clear what happened here.

155
00:07:06,577 --> 00:07:08,111
When I found Seabrook,she was...

156
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,033
sitting in Otto with the diagnostic

157
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:10,986
bay doors closed

158
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:12,262
and the engine running.

159
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,780
What's that tell you?

160
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:15,936
You think she killed herself?

161
00:07:16,563 --> 00:07:17,157
I do.

162
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:20,907
What about an accident or a malfunction?

163
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:22,716
All she had to do to shut Otto down

164
00:07:22,717 --> 00:07:24,079
was to flick the kill switch.

165
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,063
It was right in front
of her on the dashboard.

166
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:28,160
Look,obviously...

167
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,717
she couldn't face her own faults and

168
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,063
missed deadlines,so...

169
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:34,165
she took the coward's way out.

170
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,133
- That's enough,Torsten.
- She's dead, Russell.

171
00:07:36,694 --> 00:07:37,420
There's no need for you

172
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:39,702
to continue this
charade of defending her.

173
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:43,100
I'm Dr. Pike.

174
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:44,673
Project leader.

175
00:07:45,393 --> 00:07:46,795
Where is Lieutenant Seabrook?

176
00:07:50,226 --> 00:07:51,337
Could you stop?

177
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,517
Can I...

178
00:07:57,584 --> 00:07:58,486
Can I see her?

179
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:08,559
Roni...

180
00:08:11,563 --> 00:08:12,454
What have you done?

181
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:18,295
Ziva,you have really got to see this.

182
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:19,917
See what,McGee?

183
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:22,012
It's an Atlas-Seven CPU.

184
00:08:22,144 --> 00:08:24,033
It's the same one developed
for the Martian rovers.

185
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:26,032
And how does this pertain to the case?

186
00:08:26,153 --> 00:08:27,731
Well,it doesn't. I just
thought it was cool.

187
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:29,089
See,the thing about...

188
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,867
That better be your handcuffs.

189
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:35,484
I believe this is a classic
yellow light situation.

190
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:39,130
Stop moving,McGee. My hand's stuck.

191
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:40,796
It's not the only thing that's stuck.

192
00:08:41,093 --> 00:08:42,402
Make that a red light situation.

193
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:45,316
What are you doing?

194
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:48,302
Investigating a dead Naval officer.

195
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:51,783
That's a $22 million
piece of equipment,you...

196
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:56,776
You people are jeopardizing
my entire project.

197
00:08:56,974 --> 00:08:58,552
We're doing our jobs. What'd you find?

198
00:08:59,564 --> 00:09:01,802
Ah,there's a USB cable,

199
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:03,733
still attached to the
console in the passenger side.

200
00:09:03,798 --> 00:09:06,509
Also bagged a battery for
a laptop in the front seat.

201
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:08,133
I removed the laptop.

202
00:09:08,472 --> 00:09:09,055
We'll need it.

203
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,094
Absolutely not.

204
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:12,305
It contains a backup copy of Otto's AI.

205
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:15,193
Well,whatever that is,
we'll need that,too.

206
00:09:15,516 --> 00:09:17,221
That is Otto.

207
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:20,982
Already got it covered,Tony.

208
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,726
Tow truck should be here any minute now.

209
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:26,437
This is our only prototype!

210
00:09:26,596 --> 00:09:29,181
You people... you people are...

211
00:09:29,313 --> 00:09:29,884
you're...

212
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:34,564
We're cops,Federal
agents, police officers?

213
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:36,786
Maybe if you sound it out,it's easier.

214
00:09:36,787 --> 00:09:37,303
You know,

215
00:09:37,345 --> 00:09:39,815
english as a third language
is always the trickiest one.

216
00:09:39,991 --> 00:09:42,587
I'll take the laptop now, please.

217
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:50,846
I've known Roni for almost
ten years,Agent Gibbs.

218
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,033
She was one of my
brightest students at MIT.

219
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:57,063
An exceptional mind.

220
00:09:57,351 --> 00:09:59,293
Light-years ahead of her peers

221
00:09:59,386 --> 00:10:02,033
when it came to the field
of artificial intelligence.

222
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,730
Machines that can think.

223
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:04,455
Yes.

224
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:06,094
So...

225
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:08,195
that Humvee can think?

226
00:10:08,745 --> 00:10:09,993
Only about driving.

227
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:12,896
An easy task for you or
me, but for a machine,

228
00:10:12,897 --> 00:10:15,701
it takes millions of
calculations a second and complex

229
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:17,054
reasoning skills.

230
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:19,098
According to the Navy,

231
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:22,563
your thinking car is a joint
project with them and Azeon.

232
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:25,956
They've been very good to us
as far as R & D resources go.

233
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:27,133
Meaning money.

234
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,093
And Lieutenant Seabrook's time.

235
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:31,729
Gonna need your security tapes

236
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,721
and access logs that you keep,Doctor.

237
00:10:35,882 --> 00:10:38,742
She wasn't even supposed
to be here this morning,

238
00:10:38,743 --> 00:10:39,543
agent Gibbs.

239
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,514
She worked late last night. I... I...

240
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:45,302
I gave her the morning off.

241
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:46,825
She didn't take it.

242
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:49,843
She died in your garage

243
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:52,516
at zero-six-forty
this morning.

244
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,074
She must have come in to run a test.

245
00:10:56,811 --> 00:10:57,586
She's a...

246
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,556
was a perfectionist.

247
00:11:02,887 --> 00:11:03,959
Never satisfied.

248
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:08,853
Traits I'm afraid I encouraged her in.

249
00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:11,118
Sitting in a running vehicle

250
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:13,890
inside an enclosed space
is not a bright idea.

251
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:16,090
Trust me,Agent Gibbs...

252
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,867
Roni was not the type to kill herself.

253
00:11:19,664 --> 00:11:20,940
What type was she,Doctor?

254
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:22,584
Driven.

255
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,633
Lieutenant Seabrook's Naval
career was most unusual.


256
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,393
No deployments and,
as far as I can tell,

257
00:11:30,394 --> 00:11:31,778
she never set foot on a ship.

258
00:11:31,965 --> 00:11:33,328
Well,she was an egghead.

259
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:34,846
They don't recruit them to fight wars.

260
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:36,958
No. Just to build the
machines for fighting them.

261
00:11:37,035 --> 00:11:37,805
Maybe she had enough.

262
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:38,965
Enough of what?

263
00:11:39,086 --> 00:11:41,009
You'd be surprised how
many weapon designers

264
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,038
take their own lives.

265
00:11:42,072 --> 00:11:43,342
I might have a better motive.

266
00:11:44,024 --> 00:11:46,733
Azeon had everything leveraged on Otto.

267
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:49,433
It fails the drive-off,
the company goes bankrupt.

268
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:50,563
Sabotage.

269
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:52,093
Someone wanted them to fail.

270
00:11:52,685 --> 00:11:53,652
Not bad,McGee.

271
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:55,038
I got one better than better.

272
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,733
Curious to know what follows
red light behavior,Ziva?

273
00:11:57,854 --> 00:12:00,097
A potential pregnancy?

274
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,857
It's a good guess, but not in this case.

275
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:03,809
Check this out.

276
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:07,147
Ran the security footage
taken from the lab.

277
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,297
Zero-one-fifteen.

278
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,036
Last two people present
were our lieutenant

279
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:11,897
and this guy.

280
00:12:12,173 --> 00:12:14,636
Azeon's chief mechanic, Jamie Jones.

281
00:12:14,988 --> 00:12:16,044
Hold on to your socks.

282
00:12:16,396 --> 00:12:17,298
Gets a little steamy.

283
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:23,770
What about the video from
this morning,when she died?

284
00:12:23,802 --> 00:12:25,117
Oh,yeah!

285
00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:27,267
Why didn't I think of that?!

286
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:29,384
'Cause someone erased it.

287
00:12:30,346 --> 00:12:32,359
The last image taken
from any camera stops

288
00:12:32,393 --> 00:12:34,119
at zero-five-thirty-seven
this morning.

289
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,818
And then nothing but snow.

290
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:38,292
She was murdered.

291
00:12:49,383 --> 00:12:51,528
Did you find my bag,Mr. Palmer?

292
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,925
In the trunk of your car, Doctor.

293
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:54,629
Ah,thank you.

294
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:57,841
I'm sorry if I seem
a bit flustered today.

295
00:12:58,187 --> 00:12:59,672
Oh,that's understandable,Doctor.

296
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:01,195
Where did your mother cut herself?

297
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:04,560
Well,let's just say
that a woman in her 90s

298
00:13:04,561 --> 00:13:06,996
should not be using
a straight-edged razor

299
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:09,515
when grooming,and leave it at that.

300
00:13:10,142 --> 00:13:12,833
Are you hiding a secret
from me,Mr. Palmer?

301
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:16,228
Well,it's nothing to
be embarrassed about.

302
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,027
I've been thinking of
doing the same thing myself.

303
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,341
You are? Yes,only in my case,

304
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,042
I have to be careful of heart strain

305
00:13:22,043 --> 00:13:23,500
and muscle fatigue.

306
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:25,335
How long have you been pumping?

307
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:29,014
I,I wouldn't call it pumping, Doctor.

308
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:30,876
Well,whatever they call it these days,

309
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:31,884
I'm impressed with you.

310
00:13:32,472 --> 00:13:33,022
Really?

311
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:35,167
Yes,you've certainly
got yourself in shape.

312
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,185
Have you joined a gym?

313
00:13:38,142 --> 00:13:38,769
A gym?

314
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:42,123
Yes,yes,yes,I have. A,uh,few months ago.

315
00:13:42,574 --> 00:13:43,409
What have we got,Duck?

316
00:13:44,762 --> 00:13:47,732
Ah,Mr. Palmer's initial
assumption was correct.

317
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,416
Lieutenant Seabrook died of
carbon monoxide poisoning.

318
00:13:52,923 --> 00:13:53,880
Tell me something I don't know.

319
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:56,376
The levels of C.O. in her blood

320
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,762
five times the fatal dose,yes.

321
00:13:58,993 --> 00:14:00,158
She was probably rendered

322
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,150
unconscious in less than 30 seconds.

323
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:04,085
Not possible, unless she was...

324
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:05,592
She was breathing in the

325
00:14:05,614 --> 00:14:07,489
exhaust fumes directly
from the tailpipe.

326
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,139
Or someone pumped it into the vehicle.

327
00:14:09,194 --> 00:14:11,877
Which makes sense,in
light of what else I found.

328
00:14:12,196 --> 00:14:14,693
Evidence of assault. Look at her wrists.

329
00:14:14,715 --> 00:14:16,161
They're bruised.

330
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:17,811
She was restrained.

331
00:14:17,877 --> 00:14:20,653
And I also found what appear to be

332
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:23,348
bite marks on her inner thighs and back.

333
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,442
Run a rape kit.

334
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:27,593
I did. That's when I found this.

335
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,734
An intrauterine device.

336
00:14:31,756 --> 00:14:34,137
More commonly known as an I.U.D.

337
00:14:34,225 --> 00:14:35,720
Is it just me,or has
anyone else wondered

338
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:37,260
how they get those
little things in there?

339
00:14:40,244 --> 00:14:41,261
That,that probably sounded

340
00:14:41,262 --> 00:14:42,581
a lot more inappropriate than I meant.

341
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:43,576
Do you think,Palmer?

342
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:44,934
As I was saying,

343
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,199
when I ran the rape kit,

344
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,597
I found fresh male genetic material.

345
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:50,686
From last night or early this morning.

346
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:52,798
Abby's running the samples now.

347
00:14:52,996 --> 00:14:54,057
I also found

348
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,981
traces of engine oil

349
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:57,818
and a particular kind of lotion

350
00:14:57,819 --> 00:14:59,325
on her hair and skin.

351
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,294
The main ingredient was pumice.

352
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:02,723
Grease-monkey soap.

353
00:15:02,724 --> 00:15:04,439
Yeah.Except,

354
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:07,634
her nails and hands are clean.

355
00:15:08,063 --> 00:15:11,384
The skin is soft,no
calluses to speak of.

356
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:12,088
Not her soap.

357
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,458
She certainly wasn't a regular user.

358
00:15:15,855 --> 00:15:16,701
Thanks,Duck.

359
00:15:18,615 --> 00:15:19,675
Did you learn nothing

360
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:21,656
in that class this morning, Mr. Palmer?

361
00:15:23,828 --> 00:15:25,703
Jamie Jones was arrested in 1998

362
00:15:25,736 --> 00:15:28,040
for assault and battery
on his girlfriend and...

363
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:31,229
she dropped the charges and
married him six months later.

364
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:32,780
There's no accounting for taste.

365
00:15:33,187 --> 00:15:34,408
Look at Britney and K-Fed.

366
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:37,014
At least she was smart
enough to ask for a divorce.

367
00:15:37,113 --> 00:15:38,411
So was Jones' wife.

368
00:15:38,724 --> 00:15:40,253
Divorced three years ago.

369
00:15:40,825 --> 00:15:42,387
Ooh,and there's a restraining order.

370
00:15:42,447 --> 00:15:43,096
Shocking.

371
00:15:43,184 --> 00:15:44,130
Not on him.

372
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,796
He got it against his ex-wife.

373
00:15:46,181 --> 00:15:48,594
Lieutenant Seabrook wasn't
alone at Azeon last night,boss.

374
00:15:48,902 --> 00:15:50,013
She was with a mechanic.

375
00:15:51,003 --> 00:15:53,159
Yeah. The Azeon security
cameras caught it.

376
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:54,462
And there was evidence she was...

377
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:55,452
Sexually assaulted.

378
00:15:55,826 --> 00:15:56,887
Ducky thinks she was raped.

379
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:58,350
Yeah,check this out.

380
00:16:09,342 --> 00:16:10,343
You get a warrant yet?

381
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:12,532
Yeah. Right here. Name's Jamie Jones.

382
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:13,512
Ziva and I were gonna pick him up.

383
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:14,098
Not anymore.

384
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,723
You're processing the
Lieutenant's apartment.

385
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:16,585
Boss,what about me?

386
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:17,641
You get with Abby.

387
00:16:17,938 --> 00:16:19,961
The C.O. levels in that
vehicle were off the charts.

388
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:21,513
You find out how he did it.

389
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,758
Letting me drive?

390
00:16:26,099 --> 00:16:27,050
No,I'm meeting you there.

391
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:29,305
I need to drop something
off at the hospital.

392
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:30,306
What?

393
00:16:30,828 --> 00:16:32,830
A stool sample. Would
you like to see it?

394
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,035
You want me to stab you
in the eye with my knife?

395
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:42,938
Abby?

396
00:16:43,554 --> 00:16:44,857
Over here.

397
00:16:46,793 --> 00:16:47,540
Over where?

398
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,003
Over down here.

399
00:16:50,713 --> 00:16:52,704
I'm trying to decide if
this is a yellow light

400
00:16:52,705 --> 00:16:54,244
or a red light situation.

401
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:58,599
You only wish I was still
sexually harassing you.

402
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,222
So,uh,Gibbs wants us to
figure out how so much CO

403
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:03,806
got pumped into the vehicle's cabin.

404
00:17:04,004 --> 00:17:06,170
Okay,first of all,McGee,his name...

405
00:17:06,456 --> 00:17:07,363
is Otto.

406
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:09,690
O- T-T-O. It's
a palindrome.

407
00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:10,371
And second...

408
00:17:10,954 --> 00:17:14,738
he is so much more than a vehicle.

409
00:17:14,749 --> 00:17:16,574
I've never seen programming like this.

410
00:17:16,728 --> 00:17:18,917
It's complex,elegant,

411
00:17:18,983 --> 00:17:21,606
visionary.It's way out of my league.

412
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,161
You?

413
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:24,009
I got lost about 50 lines in.

414
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:26,192
Seabrook was operating at
a whole different level.

415
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,908
If they used the A.I. to sabotage

416
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:30,249
or redirect the exhaust into

417
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,537
the ventilation system,

418
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:34,259
that could take us months to track.

419
00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:35,848
Make sure you tell Gibbs that.

420
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:36,519
I did.

421
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:39,224
I told him we needed help
from the Azeon people.

422
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,512
How? Right now they're all suspects.

423
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,062
That's what he said.

424
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:44,272
Great.

425
00:17:44,745 --> 00:17:46,263
Well,how long did he give us this time?

426
00:17:46,873 --> 00:17:47,335
Today.

427
00:17:48,726 --> 00:17:50,387
This is completely unacceptable.

428
00:17:50,794 --> 00:17:52,064
When do we get our vehicle back?

429
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:53,043
When we're done with it.

430
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,198
Doing what?

431
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,799
Figuring out how it was used
to kill Lieutenant Seabrook.

432
00:17:57,188 --> 00:17:59,674
Are all NCIS agents this stupid.

433
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:00,653
Mr. Engler,

434
00:18:01,522 --> 00:18:02,589
insulting our guest

435
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,398
won't bring Otto back here any sooner.

436
00:18:05,828 --> 00:18:06,532
Of course.

437
00:18:07,301 --> 00:18:08,258
My apologies.

438
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,810
How long will it take
for you to figure out

439
00:18:10,811 --> 00:18:12,569
Roni killed herself, Agent Gibbs?

440
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:13,724
Who said she killed herself?

441
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:16,193
She was the only one
down here this morning!

442
00:18:16,853 --> 00:18:17,777
You mean except for you.

443
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,157
Torsten...

444
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,016
take a break.

445
00:18:21,626 --> 00:18:22,517
I'll handle this.

446
00:18:23,325 --> 00:18:24,205
Well,you better,Russell.

447
00:18:24,491 --> 00:18:26,586
He's jeopardizing the entire
future of this company.

448
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:33,245
What he was trying to
say was that this...

449
00:18:33,602 --> 00:18:35,164
proof-of-concept
test

450
00:18:35,285 --> 00:18:37,743
is make-or-break time
for us, agent Gibbs.

451
00:18:37,864 --> 00:18:38,612
Reschedule it.

452
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:39,778
I tried.

453
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:42,654
The D.O.D. won't budge on the dates.

454
00:18:42,676 --> 00:18:45,348
Dozens of teams are flying
in from all over the world.

455
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:48,202
Then you better help me find
Lieutenant Seabrook's killer.

456
00:18:48,488 --> 00:18:49,544
Where's your chief mechanic?

457
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:50,957
Jamie?

458
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:54,108
No. No,not possible.

459
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,840
He got along very well with Roni.

460
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:57,017
They were very good friends.

461
00:18:57,523 --> 00:18:59,865
He sexually assaulted her
in his garage last night.

462
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:08,619
That's definitely yellow light.

463
00:19:08,663 --> 00:19:10,423
Cytology tests take 72 hours,but...

464
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,672
Dr. House gets his results
back in ten minutes.

465
00:19:12,673 --> 00:19:13,497
It's ridiculous.

466
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:14,609
In the entertainment
world, they call that

467
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,303
"suspension of disbelief," actually.

468
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,247
Tony!

469
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,033
What are you doing here?

470
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:21,854
Oh,well,I was in the area,

471
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:24,632
and I thought I would, uh,drop this off.

472
00:19:24,984 --> 00:19:25,930
You found it.

473
00:19:26,238 --> 00:19:27,079
Yes,I did.

474
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,124
Thank you.

475
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,444
Uh,who's the guy molesting your neck...

476
00:19:30,642 --> 00:19:32,006
- over there.
- Oh.

477
00:19:32,148 --> 00:19:33,369
Just... curious.

478
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,580
Am I detecting a little
bit of jealousy here?

479
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:37,928
Me?

480
00:19:38,995 --> 00:19:40,128
Jealous? Yeah.

481
00:19:40,496 --> 00:19:41,068
Who was he?

482
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,333
He's gay.

483
00:19:42,685 --> 00:19:43,933
Okay. Good.

484
00:19:45,505 --> 00:19:46,924
What's next,insisting that I...

485
00:19:47,232 --> 00:19:48,475
can't see other people?

486
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:50,070
Oh,no,that would...

487
00:19:50,653 --> 00:19:51,675
that would just be cruel.

488
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,263
You're the one who was too
busy to see me last night.

489
00:19:54,557 --> 00:19:55,997
Yeah,and I'll make it up to you.

490
00:19:56,668 --> 00:19:57,251
When?

491
00:19:58,142 --> 00:19:58,791
Tomorrow.

492
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:01,183
I promise.

493
00:20:01,997 --> 00:20:02,750
Promise?

494
00:20:06,198 --> 00:20:07,831
What's that, marking your territory?

495
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:08,997
Oh,just a reminder.

496
00:20:09,326 --> 00:20:10,712
Just until you make
good on your promise.

497
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:34,381
Looks like she did

498
00:20:34,382 --> 00:20:36,625
<i>a Trading Spaces with John Nash.</i>

499
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:38,242
Russell Crowe played him in

500
00:20:38,243 --> 00:20:39,863
<i>A Beautiful Mind, that Ron Howard movie</i>

501
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,085
about the insane mathematician?

502
00:20:42,504 --> 00:20:44,303
What kind of tests are you getting done?

503
00:20:44,873 --> 00:20:45,830
Why,you worried about me?

504
00:20:46,028 --> 00:20:47,216
You're keeping a paper bag filled

505
00:20:47,217 --> 00:20:49,080
with crap in your
desk, what do you think?

506
00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:52,979
I think you should go
and check the bedroom.

507
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:54,167
That is...

508
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:57,633
unless you want me to come with you...

509
00:20:57,988 --> 00:20:58,516
and help.

510
00:21:01,557 --> 00:21:02,019
What?

511
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:06,704
Just wondering if offering
to take me to a bedroom

512
00:21:06,737 --> 00:21:09,294
constitutes sexual harassment.

513
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:12,290
Well,if you have to ask, then it's not

514
00:21:12,346 --> 00:21:13,407
- harassment.
- Tony! Get in here!

515
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:17,283
I just found Jamie Jones.

516
00:21:22,386 --> 00:21:23,310
Untie me!

517
00:21:27,627 --> 00:21:28,606
What do you think,Tony?

518
00:21:29,227 --> 00:21:31,900
Well,you saw the video of him
assaulting Lieutenant Seabrook.

519
00:21:32,065 --> 00:21:33,390
Doesn't explain how he ended up

520
00:21:33,391 --> 00:21:35,793
tied to her bedposts with
a ball gag in his mouth.

521
00:21:36,222 --> 00:21:38,361
Well,have you ever heard of accomplices?

522
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:42,563
Oh.

523
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:44,641
Tony.

524
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:46,362
Am I catching you at a bad time?

525
00:21:46,978 --> 00:21:48,429
Uh,what can I do for you?

526
00:21:48,957 --> 00:21:50,475
Tomorrow night, I was thinking sushi.

527
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,246
There's a great new place in Georgetown.

528
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:53,169
Okay.

529
00:21:53,796 --> 00:21:55,259
Well,don't sound so excited.

530
00:21:55,996 --> 00:21:56,601
I'm at work.

531
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,657
But,right,got it.

532
00:21:59,361 --> 00:21:59,713
Okay.

533
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:07,003
What part of inappropriate
touching don't you understand?

534
00:22:09,103 --> 00:22:10,346
Uni Hospital?

535
00:22:10,742 --> 00:22:12,183
Test results came back already?

536
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:15,191
I'm pregnant.

537
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:17,302
McGee's gonna be very proud.

538
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:19,804
What are you looking at?

539
00:22:20,761 --> 00:22:21,707
Keep an eye on the jumpsuit.

540
00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:29,169
This Seabrook's got a
bunch of MP3 files on here.

541
00:22:29,213 --> 00:22:31,352
All created over the last 24 hours.

542
00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:33,293
You think she was illegally downloading?

543
00:22:33,403 --> 00:22:36,647
No. They were recorded with
the laptop's microphone.

544
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,745
I think she was making
verbal observations

545
00:22:38,751 --> 00:22:40,024
while running her tests.

546
00:22:41,854 --> 00:22:43,526
I'm gonna line up the time-stamps.

547
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:45,330
She might have made a
recording while she was dying.

548
00:22:45,962 --> 00:22:48,129
So,she was in the passenger seat.

549
00:22:48,965 --> 00:22:49,927
Probably...

550
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,569
buckled her seat belt.

551
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,302
Now,if she was tied to something,

552
00:22:56,303 --> 00:22:57,664
what would she be tied to?

553
00:23:04,662 --> 00:23:05,195
McGee!

554
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:06,313
McGee!

555
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,851
McGee!

556
00:23:12,114 --> 00:23:12,878
McGee!

557
00:23:15,713 --> 00:23:17,036
McGee,help me!

558
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,845
McGee!

559
00:23:33,143 --> 00:23:34,119
McGee!

560
00:23:35,002 --> 00:23:35,696
Help!

561
00:23:38,145 --> 00:23:40,107
It won't open. The kill switch.

562
00:23:45,754 --> 00:23:46,704
Cover your face!

563
00:23:55,342 --> 00:23:56,402
Permission to hug you.

564
00:23:56,905 --> 00:23:58,202
You never have to ask,Abby.

565
00:23:58,768 --> 00:23:59,269
What happened?

566
00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:00,061
Get the chair.

567
00:24:00,687 --> 00:24:02,177
I almost bought the farm,McGee.

568
00:24:03,637 --> 00:24:06,206
I even saw that old lady
telling me to run to the light.

569
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:08,629
Boss,my back was only
turned for a few seconds.

570
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:10,261
A few mores seconds,McGee,
she'd be dead.

571
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:10,903
You okay?

572
00:24:11,246 --> 00:24:12,864
Yeah,I'm really lightheaded.

573
00:24:13,294 --> 00:24:13,737
Boss?

574
00:24:14,308 --> 00:24:15,296
Evidence cage called in an...

575
00:24:15,297 --> 00:24:16,415
- emergency alert...?
- It was me,DiNozzo.

576
00:24:16,537 --> 00:24:17,115
Stand down.

577
00:24:17,442 --> 00:24:18,688
You attacked the car?

578
00:24:18,752 --> 00:24:19,898
The car tried to kill Abby.

579
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,357
I think there was a short.

580
00:24:23,356 --> 00:24:24,836
When I tried to unbuckle my seat belt,

581
00:24:25,349 --> 00:24:27,373
it pinned me back and the windows shut

582
00:24:27,622 --> 00:24:28,788
and the engines started.

583
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,698
It triggered all the doors

584
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:31,853
in the car to lock.

585
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:35,049
And then the whole cabin
filled up with exhaust.

586
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:36,769
A few minutes more, I would've been

587
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,600
singing hymns with my angels right how.

588
00:24:38,985 --> 00:24:40,500
Abby,I'd have noticed before then.

589
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:43,251
Then I would've hugged you,McGee.

590
00:24:43,797 --> 00:24:45,855
So Lieutenant Seabrook was
killed by a malfunction?

591
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:48,051
Too many variables.

592
00:24:48,481 --> 00:24:49,360
It was deliberate.

593
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,621
The lieutenant was set
up to look like suicide.

594
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,939
I think it's time you had a
heart-to-heart with Jones,boss.

595
00:24:54,892 --> 00:24:55,647
How'd he do it?

596
00:24:56,806 --> 00:24:58,520
It's not a damn quiz,McGee!

597
00:24:58,521 --> 00:24:59,136
Find out!

598
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:00,347
On it.

599
00:25:01,117 --> 00:25:01,968
What'd you say to Jones?

600
00:25:02,212 --> 00:25:04,189
Nothing. He's been asking
about Lieutenant Seabrook.

601
00:25:04,613 --> 00:25:05,759
Acting like she's still alive.

602
00:25:07,647 --> 00:25:08,857
Come on,Ducky's checking you out.

603
00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:09,811
I'm fine,I just...

604
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:11,194
It's not a request,Abby.

605
00:25:20,668 --> 00:25:21,529
This is not good.

606
00:25:23,651 --> 00:25:26,603
Look,this is all just a big
misunderstanding,Agent Gibbs.

607
00:25:27,587 --> 00:25:29,561
All you have to do is
call one phone number,man.

608
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:34,598
Lawyer?

609
00:25:35,311 --> 00:25:35,754
No.

610
00:25:36,062 --> 00:25:36,595
Roni.

611
00:25:37,847 --> 00:25:39,889
Look,I know what it must
have looked like back

612
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:40,769
at her apartment but...

613
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,936
Lieutenant Seabrook's
your girlfriend now?

614
00:25:46,374 --> 00:25:46,747
Yeah.

615
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:48,942
Look,we worked together
for a few years,we started

616
00:25:48,943 --> 00:25:50,175
dating maybe six months back.

617
00:25:50,246 --> 00:25:50,682
Dating?

618
00:25:51,087 --> 00:25:51,466
Yeah.

619
00:26:01,986 --> 00:26:02,808
What's that look like?

620
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,656
It's a stupid game,man.

621
00:26:06,927 --> 00:26:07,967
Only when we're alone.

622
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,608
You like games,Jones?

623
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:14,568
We're just role playing, all right?

624
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,378
It's not like we're freaks.

625
00:26:18,658 --> 00:26:20,064
Am I going to lose my security clearance

626
00:26:20,065 --> 00:26:20,539
- over this...?
- Hey,...

627
00:26:21,175 --> 00:26:22,934
you almost killed one
of my people today!

628
00:26:23,226 --> 00:26:23,702
What?

629
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,885
That damn Humvee you used
to kill Lieutenant Seabrook.

630
00:26:26,032 --> 00:26:27,795
Roni... What the hell
are you talking about?

631
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:30,090
Roni is downstairs,Jones!

632
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:31,859
On a steel slab!

633
00:26:34,633 --> 00:26:35,760
This is one of her jokes,right?

634
00:26:40,273 --> 00:26:41,352
Is she behind the glass?

635
00:26:41,805 --> 00:26:42,120
Huh?

636
00:26:42,623 --> 00:26:43,773
Because if you are,Roni,

637
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:44,883
this isn't funny!

638
00:26:58,908 --> 00:26:59,409
Roni...

639
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,210
...tell me it's not real.

640
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,217
I did it,Abby.

641
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:19,312
I know how they got in.

642
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:27,329
How'd you know I was here?

643
00:27:30,311 --> 00:27:30,754
I didn't.

644
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:36,979
Abby,I'm sorry for...

645
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,489
I know.

646
00:27:48,337 --> 00:27:50,289
Thought you were supposed
to ask for permission first.

647
00:27:52,395 --> 00:27:53,657
Never with you,Tim.

648
00:27:59,882 --> 00:28:00,912
He's telling the truth.

649
00:28:01,188 --> 00:28:02,939
Just a quick test run

650
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,653
and she's coming right back to him.

651
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:07,771
Yeah. Gibbs.

652
00:28:09,504 --> 00:28:10,390
Right with you,Abs.

653
00:28:13,878 --> 00:28:15,458
The reason that we couldn't
find how they hacked

654
00:28:15,503 --> 00:28:17,175
the AI program was they didn't.

655
00:28:17,824 --> 00:28:18,587
They snuck in

656
00:28:18,588 --> 00:28:20,071
before the system was even on-line.

657
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:21,362
Makes sense.

658
00:28:21,856 --> 00:28:23,410
There were a series of commands inserted

659
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:25,404
into the flash memory
of the BIOS at boot-up.

660
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:27,275
They waited until the
conditions were met,

661
00:28:27,276 --> 00:28:29,304
and the,bam, killer car syndrome.

662
00:28:29,323 --> 00:28:31,160
Once executed, they purged from memory.

663
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:32,736
The only trace left, an extra space

664
00:28:32,737 --> 00:28:34,197
on one of the mother board's bio chips.

665
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:36,271
Figured it'd be something like that.

666
00:28:37,866 --> 00:28:38,245
Right.

667
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,221
We know the program was flashed from a

668
00:28:41,222 --> 00:28:43,179
physical device that
was tied into the system.

669
00:28:43,211 --> 00:28:44,871
Memory stick. SD card.

670
00:28:44,903 --> 00:28:45,912
We just need to find it.

671
00:28:45,937 --> 00:28:47,478
And when we do,we'll
have the killer code

672
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:48,566
and a clue to who wrote it.

673
00:28:50,512 --> 00:28:51,321
I think we lost him.

674
00:28:51,334 --> 00:28:53,000
We need to try it again but slower.

675
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:54,502
So what you're saying, for example,

676
00:28:54,503 --> 00:28:56,310
is we need to find something this small

677
00:28:56,682 --> 00:28:57,812
in a Humvee jammed with

678
00:28:57,813 --> 00:28:59,581
$22 million worth of electronics.

679
00:29:00,445 --> 00:29:01,016
Pretty much.

680
00:29:03,902 --> 00:29:04,448
We're screwed.

681
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:08,090
Now that is an excellent point.

682
00:29:12,023 --> 00:29:12,800
You wanted to see me?

683
00:29:13,605 --> 00:29:15,243
You have plans tonight,Tony.

684
00:29:15,474 --> 00:29:17,317
Actually no. Tomorrow,I'm going to...

685
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:18,562
It wasn't a question.

686
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,393
We've had these three under observation

687
00:29:21,394 --> 00:29:23,478
ever since you tagged
their bags at the airport.

688
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:26,938
They made reservations
for dinner tonight here.

689
00:29:27,606 --> 00:29:29,272
The reservation is for four.

690
00:29:29,975 --> 00:29:31,410
I want to know who they're meeting with.

691
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:32,431
Excellent.

692
00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:34,903
I've always wanted to try
the food at this place,

693
00:29:34,904 --> 00:29:36,849
but it's a little
outside of my price range.

694
00:29:37,635 --> 00:29:38,603
You won't be inside.

695
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:40,671
We couldn't risk them
I.D.'ing you as the

696
00:29:40,672 --> 00:29:42,399
baggage handler from the airport.

697
00:29:43,212 --> 00:29:44,259
So what's the plan?

698
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:47,967
We're going to take a more
covert approach on this one.

699
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:51,759
Oh,I ever tell you
covert's my middle name?

700
00:29:53,348 --> 00:29:56,395
* In my perspective *

701
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,837
* I see the people
from the big jet plane *

702
00:30:02,716 --> 00:30:05,818
* The woman looks Teutonic,
she drinks a vodka tonic *

703
00:30:06,068 --> 00:30:08,386
* And two bald men sit with her *

704
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:10,258
* Waiting for a fourth *

705
00:30:10,611 --> 00:30:14,292
* They're not going to
order that main course *

706
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:16,762
* Until that person come... *

707
00:30:18,293 --> 00:30:18,569
Hey...

708
00:30:19,471 --> 00:30:20,274
Everybody's a critic.

709
00:30:20,868 --> 00:30:21,465
Am-scray.

710
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:22,852
Get out of here.

711
00:30:27,847 --> 00:30:30,029
Keep your eyes on the
prize, Tango Eight.

712
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,001
I may even let you keep
the money you're making.

713
00:30:32,181 --> 00:30:36,368
* Sorry,I just do what I can... *

714
00:30:36,413 --> 00:30:38,714
You're not going to sing
the whole thing,are you?

715
00:30:38,715 --> 00:30:41,604
* I gotta do what I gotta do *

716
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,885
* I'm just a man *

717
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:47,116
* Oh,speaking of man *

718
00:30:47,456 --> 00:30:50,557
* Another man walks
through that front door *

719
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:52,965
* Wearing a polka-dot scarf *

720
00:30:53,473 --> 00:30:56,018
* Will he join the table? I don't know *

721
00:30:56,275 --> 00:31:00,180
* Yes,he does and greets the
pretty lady, what do they say? *

722
00:31:00,523 --> 00:31:01,197
* Who knows *

723
00:31:01,435 --> 00:31:02,790
* He's sitting at the table

724
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:05,230
* With the other people from the plane *

725
00:31:06,503 --> 00:31:08,164
Stay steady on the target, Tango 8.

726
00:31:08,165 --> 00:31:09,037
I want his photo.

727
00:31:09,121 --> 00:31:10,379
Isolate and freeze-frame.

728
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,351
* They are having a conversation *

729
00:31:15,182 --> 00:31:17,526
* A heavy,heavy conversation *

730
00:31:18,071 --> 00:31:20,816
* That man
talk,a-talk,a-talk a lot *

731
00:31:20,848 --> 00:31:22,935
* Talk,a-talk,a-talk
a lot *

732
00:31:23,818 --> 00:31:26,691
* Jenny,think I've been made *

733
00:31:27,494 --> 00:31:29,433
* Do you see what I see? *

734
00:31:29,504 --> 00:31:30,653
Relax,Tango 8.

735
00:31:30,935 --> 00:31:33,562
I'm sure he's just checking
his reflection in the glass.

736
00:31:36,886 --> 00:31:38,443
Hey,what was that movie

737
00:31:38,444 --> 00:31:40,197
where they took the whole car apart?

738
00:31:40,447 --> 00:31:41,545
I am not Tony.

739
00:31:41,975 --> 00:31:43,878
Come on. You know the one.
They were looking for heroin

740
00:31:44,116 --> 00:31:45,817
and they took apart that entire car?

741
00:31:46,042 --> 00:31:46,983
Still not Tony.

742
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,532
Abby,I think I found it.

743
00:32:07,876 --> 00:32:09,169
That's it. That's the kill program.

744
00:32:09,182 --> 00:32:09,927
Yes!

745
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:11,295
That's a good job.

746
00:32:12,585 --> 00:32:13,773
Now put it back together.

747
00:32:16,672 --> 00:32:17,334
As in "now."

748
00:32:17,713 --> 00:32:18,859
Gibbs,what's the rush?

749
00:32:19,141 --> 00:32:21,388
The Director just assured
the Secretary of The Navy

750
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:23,402
we were handling this
thing with kid gloves.

751
00:32:23,403 --> 00:32:24,795
Well,we didn't get that memo

752
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:25,292
'cause...

753
00:32:25,812 --> 00:32:26,088
you know,...

754
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,270
we're wearing latex.

755
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,524
Well,they want a team
from Azeon to come by,

756
00:32:29,525 --> 00:32:31,165
check and make sure we
didn't break anything.

757
00:32:31,762 --> 00:32:32,173
When?

758
00:32:33,033 --> 00:32:33,598
Two hours.

759
00:32:34,728 --> 00:32:36,712
Boss,it took us ten
just to take it apart.

760
00:32:37,605 --> 00:32:38,838
Yeah,that's why I brought you help.

761
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:44,233
And Roni would be in tears
if she saw Otto like this.

762
00:32:44,656 --> 00:32:45,959
Can you do it or not,Jones?

763
00:32:48,893 --> 00:32:49,555
Does he have to run?

764
00:32:50,303 --> 00:32:51,140
It'd be nice.

765
00:32:53,882 --> 00:32:54,608
You all right?

766
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:56,328
Define "all right."

767
00:32:57,738 --> 00:33:00,133
Find out the results from
the medical tests yet?

768
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:04,319
Not yet.

769
00:33:05,937 --> 00:33:07,401
Time's the Azeon team getting here?

770
00:33:07,573 --> 00:33:09,340
40 minutes ago.

771
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:10,357
You fell asleep.

772
00:33:11,105 --> 00:33:13,015
Gibbs and Jenny are stalling
them in her office now.

773
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:15,992
If you've discovered the
problem with the vehicle,

774
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:17,189
we can fix it.

775
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:18,087
Wasn't a problem.

776
00:33:18,386 --> 00:33:19,269
It was sabotage.

777
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:20,805
By whom?

778
00:33:21,353 --> 00:33:23,448
An expert in artificial intelligence.

779
00:33:23,897 --> 00:33:25,203
Then it wasn't Jamie.

780
00:33:25,827 --> 00:33:27,901
It must be one of the companies
we're competing against.

781
00:33:27,902 --> 00:33:30,438
They,they know they can't
beat us in a fair fight.

782
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:32,068
The winner of the drive-off

783
00:33:32,069 --> 00:33:34,125
gets the entire D.O.D. contract,

784
00:33:34,126 --> 00:33:36,044
Director Shepard, not just the Navy's.

785
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:38,213
The Navy's banking on you, Doctor.

786
00:33:38,351 --> 00:33:40,596
It's why I've agreed to
the Secretary's request

787
00:33:40,597 --> 00:33:42,175
that you visually inspect Otto.

788
00:33:42,476 --> 00:33:43,091
When?

789
00:33:46,313 --> 00:33:47,681
Right how if you'd like.

790
00:33:48,044 --> 00:33:50,164
Agent Gibbs, would
you mind escorting us?

791
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:16,122
Where is Otto?

792
00:34:18,632 --> 00:34:19,221
Gibbs?

793
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,944
We have let a robot-killer Humvee loose

794
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,188
on the streets of Washington.

795
00:34:35,201 --> 00:34:37,972
Uh,technically,Director,
it's a second-generation,

796
00:34:37,973 --> 00:34:39,691
- fully...
- I don't care what it's called!

797
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,791
Find it! Fast.

798
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:48,293
BOLO,on it,boss.

799
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:50,563
I'll take the Beltway!

800
00:34:51,221 --> 00:34:52,148
Abby and I will see

801
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:53,855
if we can access Otto's system remotely.

802
00:34:54,281 --> 00:34:55,686
I think I might be
able to help with that.

803
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:03,462
Someone had to send Otto

804
00:35:03,474 --> 00:35:05,694
a remote command and navigational data.

805
00:35:05,782 --> 00:35:06,966
All we have to do is find it...

806
00:35:06,967 --> 00:35:08,637
...so we can back-trace
it to our bad guy.

807
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:11,118
If we access the vehicle,
can we remotely operate it?

808
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:12,667
Yeah,I've seen Roni do it before.

809
00:35:12,886 --> 00:35:13,224
How?

810
00:35:14,008 --> 00:35:15,405
I don't know,man. I'm
just a mechanic, all right?

811
00:35:15,638 --> 00:35:17,219
All this A.I. stuff is
way out of my league.

812
00:35:17,259 --> 00:35:19,153
Okay,what's your job during test runs?

813
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,092
I monitor stuff like

814
00:35:20,108 --> 00:35:22,042
tire pressure, fuel injectors...

815
00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:22,548
How?

816
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,065
I have my own program.

817
00:35:24,731 --> 00:35:25,963
I mean,I could try...

818
00:35:25,995 --> 00:35:26,364
Do it.

819
00:35:27,231 --> 00:35:27,737
All right.

820
00:35:28,194 --> 00:35:29,935
But even if I can get
in, all I can tell you

821
00:35:29,936 --> 00:35:31,807
is stuff like oil
pressure and fuel levels.

822
00:35:32,389 --> 00:35:33,965
Navigation,external sensors,

823
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:35,218
that's all handled by scientists.

824
00:35:40,622 --> 00:35:41,829
All right,I'm in. Now what?

825
00:35:42,415 --> 00:35:44,346
Just sit back and let the scientists...

826
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:46,199
...kick all kinds of major ass.

827
00:35:53,414 --> 00:35:55,012
Roni would've really liked you guys.

828
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:01,545
Okay,Abby,we're in sync.

829
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:03,211
You are now following
the same stream back

830
00:36:03,212 --> 00:36:04,527
into Otto as Jamie's program.

831
00:36:06,348 --> 00:36:06,773
Jamie,

832
00:36:06,774 --> 00:36:09,037
what's the most complex
sensor you monitor with this?

833
00:36:09,591 --> 00:36:10,738
I'd say fuel injectors.

834
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:12,977
And when something goes
wrong, do you just monitor it,

835
00:36:12,978 --> 00:36:14,367
or is there something
you can actually do?

836
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:15,822
I have the ability to tweak

837
00:36:15,823 --> 00:36:17,391
some of the parameters
to avoid engine damage.

838
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:19,158
That's our way in. Is
that program on here,too?

839
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:20,374
Yes...

840
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,550
it's right there.

841
00:36:22,337 --> 00:36:24,302
Great. Before we were just receiving.

842
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:26,037
Now we can send. Tweak something.

843
00:36:26,878 --> 00:36:27,797
All right. What?

844
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:28,439
It doesn't matter.

845
00:36:28,632 --> 00:36:29,780
I just need to follow it

846
00:36:29,781 --> 00:36:30,937
downstream back into Otto.

847
00:36:31,698 --> 00:36:33,319
Okay. Um...

848
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:36,637
How's that?

849
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:40,664
I'm in.

850
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:44,187
Pull up the navigation subdirectory.

851
00:36:45,218 --> 00:36:48,497
Accessing Otto's onboard GPS.

852
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:51,667
It's stopped.

853
00:36:51,808 --> 00:36:54,549
It's right off Route 123 in Fairfax.

854
00:36:54,621 --> 00:36:55,295
Go,McGee.

855
00:36:55,761 --> 00:36:57,004
I'll keep working on back-tracing

856
00:36:57,005 --> 00:36:57,892
the guy who sent him there.

857
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:15,633
Clear!

858
00:37:19,814 --> 00:37:21,167
They took our chip,boss.

859
00:37:21,396 --> 00:37:23,225
Hey,McGee,when I told
you to put this car back

860
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,730
together I didn't mean put it back

861
00:37:24,731 --> 00:37:26,179
together with the only piece of evidence

862
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,142
we have on the killer.

863
00:37:27,143 --> 00:37:27,880
I didn't.

864
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:30,023
We put in a copy.
Abby's got the original.

865
00:37:30,216 --> 00:37:31,974
Otto has five stereo cameras.

866
00:37:31,975 --> 00:37:33,715
Hoping one of them got
a picture of our guy.

867
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,676
We're definitely dealing
with someone on the inside.

868
00:37:37,677 --> 00:37:39,422
He knew where all of
Otto's cameras were.

869
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:40,983
The only shot I got is this.

870
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,756
This thing takes worse
pictures than you do,McGee.

871
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:46,244
They went to a lot of trouble
to get the chip back. Why?

872
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:48,539
Like you said, It's the
only evidence we have.

873
00:37:48,989 --> 00:37:50,943
They know we can link it to 'em. How?

874
00:37:51,321 --> 00:37:53,122
There weren't any prints on the surface.

875
00:37:53,307 --> 00:37:54,655
The program's in assembly language.

876
00:37:54,656 --> 00:37:55,317
I'm not sure.

877
00:37:58,171 --> 00:37:59,014
Yeah. Gibbs.

878
00:37:59,054 --> 00:38:00,997
I back-traced the connection
used to activate Otto.

879
00:38:01,676 --> 00:38:03,113
They're in Azeon's network.

880
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,107
They're online right now.

881
00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:06,399
I even have their... Gibbs?

882
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,405
Don't worry,Jamie. We
are going to get this guy.

883
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:17,302
You're sure about this, Agent Gibbs?

884
00:38:17,893 --> 00:38:19,441
We sure about this,McGee?

885
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:22,024
Abby gave me the specific I.P. address

886
00:38:22,025 --> 00:38:23,737
for the computer used to access Otto.

887
00:38:23,893 --> 00:38:25,027
I'll know it when I find it.

888
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:28,711
Which one was it?

889
00:38:29,246 --> 00:38:30,080
We're working on it.

890
00:38:36,795 --> 00:38:37,450
Boss?

891
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:39,614
I.P. address matches this one.

892
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,475
Engler.

893
00:38:45,718 --> 00:38:47,211
You're bastard! You killed her!

894
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:48,337
Get him off me!

895
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,357
What's the matter? You
couldn't share the limelight?!

896
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:52,669
Why would I kill Seabrook?!

897
00:38:52,693 --> 00:38:54,912
You've been jealous of Roni
from the moment you met her.

898
00:38:54,913 --> 00:38:55,934
That's ridiculous!

899
00:38:55,935 --> 00:38:58,002
If anything, she was jealous of me.

900
00:38:58,729 --> 00:39:01,408
I demand to know what
proof you have against me.

901
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:06,210
This.

902
00:39:07,168 --> 00:39:07,998
A flash chip?

903
00:39:08,382 --> 00:39:09,891
It was used to kill Lieutenant Seabrook.

904
00:39:10,078 --> 00:39:11,871
The one you took from
the vehicle was a copy.

905
00:39:12,638 --> 00:39:14,119
Then let me see the code.

906
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:16,651
Everyone here has their
own specific style.

907
00:39:16,652 --> 00:39:18,967
I can tell you with
certainty who wrote that one.

908
00:39:18,968 --> 00:39:20,987
As can
I,Engler- may I?

909
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:39,164
You're mistaken, Agent Gibbs,

910
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:41,092
this chip is blank.

911
00:39:43,695 --> 00:39:44,326
Let him go.

912
00:39:45,647 --> 00:39:46,190
Boss?

913
00:39:46,558 --> 00:39:48,497
Let him go, he's the
one who found Seabrook.

914
00:39:49,356 --> 00:39:50,658
If he wanted the chip back,

915
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:52,190
he would have taken it
before anyone got there.

916
00:39:54,342 --> 00:39:55,140
Dr. Pike...

917
00:39:59,507 --> 00:40:01,352
The only thing you erased from this chip

918
00:40:02,258 --> 00:40:03,272
are my photos.

919
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,684
The real chip is in the
evidence locker at NCIS.

920
00:40:11,065 --> 00:40:12,589
She thought of you like a father!

921
00:40:13,032 --> 00:40:15,414
She was supposed to
take the morning off,

922
00:40:15,558 --> 00:40:16,140
Jamie.

923
00:40:18,327 --> 00:40:19,571
It was an accident.

924
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,786
I would never...

925
00:40:21,993 --> 00:40:22,611
never...

926
00:40:22,851 --> 00:40:24,618
Who was supposed to
drive Otto that morning?

927
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:28,169
Me.

928
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:29,980
You...

929
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:32,437
senile old fool,

930
00:40:32,469 --> 00:40:34,089
you were trying to kill me.

931
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,840
I did it for all of us.

932
00:40:36,558 --> 00:40:37,859
He owns half the company.

933
00:40:38,266 --> 00:40:40,017
When Otto wins that race,

934
00:40:40,065 --> 00:40:42,794
we would have been stuck
working with him forever.

935
00:40:43,472 --> 00:40:44,941
Nobody deserves that.

936
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,971
You smug bastard.

937
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:49,014
I'll never? on this

938
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:50,019
Look...

939
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:52,708
If "red light" is for
sexually assaulting

940
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:54,947
a coworker,what color is for murder?

941
00:40:55,876 --> 00:40:57,025
How's "black light" sound?

942
00:40:57,871 --> 00:40:58,525
Works for me.

943
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:11,639
Hey.

944
00:41:13,107 --> 00:41:13,905
It's late; go home.

945
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:16,299
Just doing a little research.

946
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:17,292
On what?

947
00:41:18,665 --> 00:41:19,355
Y. Pestis.

948
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:22,044
A very nasty illness.

949
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:25,942
It can cause permanent damage
to the heart,lungs and kidneys,

950
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:27,825
and in some cases, patients can relapse

951
00:41:27,826 --> 00:41:30,203
months or even years later.

952
00:41:31,304 --> 00:41:31,966
Tony had it.

953
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,204
I know,Ziva,I was there.

954
00:41:34,707 --> 00:41:37,484
Did you know that he had
some tests done recently?

955
00:41:37,675 --> 00:41:40,308
and he's been wearing a
hospital bracelet on his wrist.

956
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,387
No.

957
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:45,068
I asked him why, but he won't tell me.

958
00:41:46,768 --> 00:41:48,356
And he's probably got
a pretty good reason.&

959
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:09,337
So,uh... can I take this off now?

960
00:42:12,379 --> 00:42:13,915
I haven't made up my mind yet.

961
00:42:14,394 --> 00:42:14,881
Okay.

962
00:42:15,751 --> 00:42:17,570
You do know that it's
for the psych ward,right?

963
00:42:19,118 --> 00:42:20,035
Oh,yeah.

964
00:42:20,434 --> 00:42:22,222
I picked it out special for you.
