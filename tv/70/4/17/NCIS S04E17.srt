1
00:00:02,851 --> 00:00:06,280
In pain, we may find
comfort, in sorrow, hope,

2
00:00:06,352 --> 00:00:08,845
in death, resurrection.

3
00:00:16,853 --> 00:00:18,574
Aim... fire!

4
00:00:20,181 --> 00:00:22,066
Aim... fire!

5
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,605
They're almost finished out there, Ken.

6
00:00:25,749 --> 00:00:26,749
What do you want me to tell you, Jack?

7
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:28,324
I can't get the damn thing open.

8
00:00:28,346 --> 00:00:30,498
- Stripped?
- Nah, it's catching.

9
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:31,925
It's just stuck or something.

10
00:00:31,926 --> 00:00:33,877
When was the last time you
opened one of these things?

11
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:35,786
First one we've had since
I've been with the VA.

12
00:00:35,832 --> 00:00:37,600
That's, like, what, a decade?

13
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:39,360
Yeah. Let me try.

14
00:00:44,947 --> 00:00:45,947
Okay, it's moving.

15
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:48,199
What's that smell?

16
00:00:58,847 --> 00:00:59,847
You okay?

17
00:01:57,668 --> 00:01:58,668
Give me a dollar!

18
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:01,168
Okay. What's wrong with that one?

19
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:03,732
The machine wouldn't take
it and I want a candy bar.

20
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:05,168
What's wrong with that candy bar?

21
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:06,280
It has nougat in it.

22
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:07,592
But you hate nougat.

23
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:08,921
I know!

24
00:02:09,105 --> 00:02:10,438
It was a mistake, McGee!

25
00:02:10,857 --> 00:02:12,079
Do you have a dollar?!

26
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:15,255
All I have are big bills.

27
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,370
What is nougat?

28
00:02:16,422 --> 00:02:17,910
It's whipped dolphin fat.

29
00:02:18,246 --> 00:02:20,605
No, that's the filling in Klowny Kake.

30
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:21,806
That is a myth!

31
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:24,337
Would someone please give me a dollar?!

32
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,083
Sure, I got one.

33
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:35,895
Thanks.

34
00:02:36,024 --> 00:02:38,835
God, it's like some kind
of crime to not like nougat.

35
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:40,206
I don't even know what nougat is.

36
00:02:40,207 --> 00:02:42,707
It's a cream made from
sugar, honey and nuts.

37
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:43,896
Grab your gear.

38
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:47,523
Got an explosion at a Marine's
funeral in James River National.

39
00:02:47,724 --> 00:02:50,779
Did anyone else see what
just happened there with Abby?

40
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,781
Yeah, she stole my dollar.

41
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:55,874
Last ones to the party.

42
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:59,272
It's not really a party until
the bomb squad says it is.

43
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,910
What'd you find?

44
00:03:03,936 --> 00:03:04,973
We got nothing.

45
00:03:04,974 --> 00:03:05,974
No ordnance,

46
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:07,994
no residue, no electronics,

47
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:09,087
no time device,

48
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:11,140
no wiring, no remote.

49
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:12,820
No evidence of a bomb.

50
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:14,362
Except for the explosion.

51
00:03:14,787 --> 00:03:17,009
We got two employees injured, both vets.

52
00:03:17,162 --> 00:03:18,410
They were taken to the VA

53
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:19,999
with concussions and shrapnel wounds.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Got names?

55
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:22,976
Former Lance Corporal Lloyd Jackson,

56
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,308
36, and PFC Kenneth Dixon, 25.

57
00:03:26,343 --> 00:03:27,539
Veterans keep getting younger.

58
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,651
The kid they were burying was only 22.

59
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,775
It's a family crypt.

60
00:03:30,976 --> 00:03:33,599
- Tandem?
- His grandfather was in the back slot.

61
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:35,412
Still there as far as we could tell.

62
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:36,413
Your men cleared?

63
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:38,245
Fire readings are clean.

64
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,287
Air's safe to breathe, not
that I would recommend it.

65
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:41,288

Anything else?

66
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:43,878
Yeah. You might want
to cover your shoes.

67
00:03:54,914 --> 00:03:56,247
That is truly appalling.

68
00:03:57,602 --> 00:03:59,824
"Chief Warrant Officer Mitchell Waller."

69
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:04,354
Died, 1978. Should be the
one in the back of the crypt.

70
00:04:04,355 --> 00:04:05,966
He appears to be undisturbed.

71
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:07,654
He would be the only one.

72
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:10,571
This is really the most
disgusting thing I've ever seen.

73
00:04:10,572 --> 00:04:13,083
And believe me, that says a lot.

74
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:14,522
It's like porridge.

75
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:16,077
The word is "effluvium",

76
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:20,536
the result of decomposing
human organs and tissue.

77
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:21,616
This is people?

78
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:23,168
Yes, two, I'd say,

79
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:24,446
judging bye the volume.

80
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:26,166
And the two skulls, of course.

81
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:29,949
Mr. Palmer, we have
to recover all of this.

82
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,946
One Wet Vac for the Soylent
Green coming right up.

83
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:35,642
Somewhat claustrophobic.

84
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:37,512
And for all eternity.

85
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,105
Our friends here might agree with you.

86
00:04:40,106 --> 00:04:41,981
They obviously needed to get out.

87
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,733
They didn't belong
there in the first place.

88
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:45,606
Vents are definitely clogged.

89
00:04:45,607 --> 00:04:47,358
Careful, Doctor, we still haven't

90
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:49,169
found traces of what
caused the explosion.

91
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,394
If my suspicions are
correct, Officer David,

92
00:04:53,429 --> 00:04:55,180
the bomb is all around us.

93
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:58,546
It's a phenomenon in the death industry

94
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:03,817
informally referred to as
"exploding casket syndrome."

95
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:06,107
Well, the floor's all yours, Duck.

96
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:07,408
Thank you, Jethro.

97
00:05:07,736 --> 00:05:11,475
All bodies contain enzymes and bacteria.

98
00:05:11,484 --> 00:05:15,235
Immediately upon death, they
start to break down tissue.

99
00:05:15,236 --> 00:05:17,860
Yes, a body can liquefy within a week,

100
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:19,920
especially if it hasn't been embalmed.

101
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:22,887
It's possible that these remains

102
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:25,230
were human in appearance

103
00:05:25,265 --> 00:05:27,108
as recently as two weeks ago.

104
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:28,772
And someone dumped them in here.

105
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:31,048
Yes, and in such a confined space,

106
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:33,944
as the gases were given off the bodies,

107
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:36,361
without any proper ventilation

108
00:05:36,362 --> 00:05:39,237
the crypt itself could
become a pressure cooker.

109
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,068
The bodies were the bomb.

110
00:05:43,111 --> 00:05:45,362
Not our first meat puzzle, Doctor.

111
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:47,485
And it certainly won't be the last.

112
00:05:47,486 --> 00:05:49,049
Never forget, Mr. Palmer,

113
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,480
experience is the ultimate teacher.

114
00:05:51,988 --> 00:05:53,611
Corner pieces are not as reliable

115
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:55,175
as the singular components.

116
00:05:55,176 --> 00:05:57,551
Yes, as experience has taught us.

117
00:05:57,552 --> 00:05:58,852
Skulls and torsos.

118
00:05:59,112 --> 00:06:01,897
And judging by these pelvic structures,

119
00:06:02,176 --> 00:06:04,236
we have a man and a woman.

120
00:06:04,338 --> 00:06:05,623
Yes, well, let's put Adam

121
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:07,351
on the left and Eve on the right.

122
00:06:07,352 --> 00:06:08,977
This reminds me of a summer

123
00:06:08,978 --> 00:06:11,726
when I assisted at an archaeological dig

124
00:06:11,827 --> 00:06:13,207
in North Africa.

125
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:15,192
Our team unearthed

126
00:06:15,354 --> 00:06:19,589
two fossilized Neanderthals
from a primitive burial mound:

127
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,078
one man, one woman.

128
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:23,978
This rib structure's fractured, Doctor.

129
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:26,291
Possibly from the
force of the explosion?

130
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:27,354
Oh, no, no, no.

131
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:28,854
It's a clean, serrated edge.

132
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:29,860
Very unlikely.

133
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:33,146
Did you know that the Zulus burn

134
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:36,761
all the possessions of a dear departed

135
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:38,575
to ward off evil?

136
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,547
Some tribes even throw spears

137
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:44,694
and shoot arrows into the
air to kill hovering spirits.

138
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,614
Right ulna.

139
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,680
That evolved into the
modern military tradition

140
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:51,956
of firing a volley into the air.

141
00:06:53,794 --> 00:06:54,914
Uh, right hand.

142
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:58,041
Yes, after the death of an African king,

143
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,042
right hand,

144
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:02,794
some of his subjects used
to cut off fingers and toes.

145
00:07:02,795 --> 00:07:06,195
It was considered a mark of respect.

146
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:07,419
Humerus.

147
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:10,847
I suppose it depends
on what you find funny.

148
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:15,380
Oh, right,

149
00:07:16,196 --> 00:07:17,786
humerus.

150
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:20,607
Right hand.

151
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:30,673
Didn't this happen the last time?

152
00:07:30,674 --> 00:07:32,919
We're gonna need another table.

153
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:34,673
The mausoleum doesn't get many visitors

154
00:07:34,674 --> 00:07:36,232
which makes it a creative place

155
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:37,732
to get rid of a few bodies,

156
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:38,804
- but...
- Whoever deposited them

157
00:07:38,846 --> 00:07:40,036
would first have to know that a portion

158
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,984
of Chief Waller's crypt was vacant.

159
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:43,673
That would suggest an inside job.

160
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:46,319
With the knowledge to
access a sealed tomb.

161
00:07:46,423 --> 00:07:48,841
Which would point to Jackson...

162
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:50,703
or Dixon.

163
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:52,822
If they hadn't practically
blown themselves up.

164
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:56,065
What do you think, McGee?

165
00:07:57,675 --> 00:07:59,610
She definitely seemed un-Abby.

166
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:00,611
Who?

167
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:01,612
Abby.

168
00:08:01,624 --> 00:08:02,624
Abby's unhappy?

169
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:04,081
No, Abby's un-Abby.

170
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:05,536
I need you to focus here,

171
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:06,981
okay? Pitch in?

172
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:08,762
I'll talk to her when I can.

173
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:09,800
Why you?

174
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:11,002
Because dealing with an angry

175
00:08:11,049 --> 00:08:13,242
woman requires a great
deal of sensitivity.

176
00:08:13,737 --> 00:08:16,752
Clearly not an area
of expertise for you.

177
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:18,334
Well, I don't doubt that you have

178
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:20,363
more experience with angry women.

179
00:08:20,864 --> 00:08:22,963
Now, you see, that wasn't
very sensitive, was it?

180
00:08:22,964 --> 00:08:24,801
The man has one serious relationship

181
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:26,488
and all of a sudden he's an expert.

182
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:28,749
All right, there is one
clear-cut undeniable reason

183
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,177
why I should be the one to talk to Abby.

184
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,243
She owes me a dollar. Now...

185
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,613
We ran down I. D.'s on the remains,

186
00:08:38,614 --> 00:08:40,302
got a hit on the woman.

187
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:41,428
Classic DiNozzo.

188
00:08:42,426 --> 00:08:43,926
One intact fingerprint

189
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:46,178
off her left hand
matches driver's license.

190
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:48,927
Marilyn Torrance, age
58 of Tyson's Corner.

191
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,260
There's no case file because

192
00:08:51,341 --> 00:08:53,791
her nephew and his wife
never reported her missing.

193
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,615
They're on their way in.

194
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:56,616
That it?

195
00:08:59,156 --> 00:09:00,164
McGee?

196
00:09:00,168 --> 00:09:01,516
Is there Jethro right there?

197
00:09:01,562 --> 00:09:02,826
Be right there, Ducky.

198
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:05,506
Saved by the bell.

199
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:07,346
They were dismembered

200
00:09:07,805 --> 00:09:11,955
by severing tendons, muscles
from ligaments at every joint.

201
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:14,428
The neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip,

202
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,655
knee, ankle,

203
00:09:16,592 --> 00:09:17,642
et cetera.

204
00:09:18,617 --> 00:09:20,682
There's very little damage
to the bones themselves,

205
00:09:20,683 --> 00:09:22,741
except the rib cages, they were cut.

206
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:25,246
Probably using a bone saw.

207
00:09:25,307 --> 00:09:26,667
Were they murdered?

208
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:28,241
One of them at least was.

209
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:30,930
Blunt-force trauma to the female skull.

210
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:32,430
A blow to the back of the head

211
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:34,742
that was certainly enough
to kill a woman of her age.

212
00:09:34,743 --> 00:09:36,973
Fourth-rib-phase
analysis suggests

213
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,169
that she was in her 70s.

214
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,683
According to the DMV,
Marilyn Torrance was 58.

215
00:09:40,684 --> 00:09:41,931
Women lie about their age.

216
00:09:41,932 --> 00:09:43,522
But this is her hand.

217
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:45,119
Not her head.

218
00:09:45,244 --> 00:09:46,995
Well, maybe that's her head.

219
00:09:46,996 --> 00:09:48,183
That's a man's skull.

220
00:09:48,184 --> 00:09:50,683
Well, maybe you reassembled
the pieces incorrectly.

221
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:52,870
The problem is we can't
reassemble the pieces.

222
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:53,995
We don't have two

223
00:09:53,996 --> 00:09:55,591
full sets of remains.

224
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:57,118
We're missing pieces.

225
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:59,322
Yes, and these unrelated pieces, well,

226
00:09:59,722 --> 00:10:02,479
they belong to at least
three different people.

227
00:10:02,557 --> 00:10:03,857
Three more bodies?

228
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:05,557
We're missing a lot of pieces.

229
00:10:05,558 --> 00:10:06,718
This is more than someone

230
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,000
just dumping two bodies.

231
00:10:08,497 --> 00:10:11,687
I think you're looking
for a mass murderer.

232
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:22,045
<i>Can't we talk about this?</i>

233
00:10:23,807 --> 00:10:25,348
<i>There's no point...</i>

234
00:10:26,523 --> 00:10:28,113
What do you got, Abs?

235
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:31,397
Decaying flesh, organs and human tissue.

236
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:34,151
- The DNA confirms that...
- Five different people.

237
00:10:34,152 --> 00:10:35,963
Well, if you already talked to Ducky,

238
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:37,439
there's not much I can tell you.

239
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,464
You didn't give me much
to work with, Gibbs.

240
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:40,838
There's barely any blood.

241
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:42,401
The bodies were probably drained.

242
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,042
So what, you think we're
looking for a vampire?

243
00:10:47,524 --> 00:10:49,900
There are traces of cellulose, fiber,

244
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:51,616
common paper and string.

245
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:53,213
The parts were wrapped.

246
00:10:53,214 --> 00:10:55,500
Yeah, but they're too degraded
to get any fingerprints off of.

247
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:56,777
There was one thing.

248
00:10:56,778 --> 00:10:59,213
The screws from the marble frontispiece.

249
00:10:59,214 --> 00:11:03,101
They've been collecting rust
since the interment in 1978.

250
00:11:03,102 --> 00:11:04,401
But look at the heads.

251
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:05,654
They're scratched.

252
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:07,502
That's from the screwdriver.
it dislodged the rust.

253
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:09,528
But look at the other crypts.

254
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,499
See the screws?

255
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,089
Yeah. They're all rusted.

256
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,300
Except for these two crypts.

257
00:11:19,704 --> 00:11:23,527
Anson Gage, USMC, Colonel;
Raymond Dalton, U. S. Army.

258
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:26,143
Might be vandalism, but
it might be something.

259
00:11:27,156 --> 00:11:28,590
- DiNozzo.
- Contact next of kin

260
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:30,968
and get permission to open
those two crypts. On it, boss!

261
00:11:31,969 --> 00:11:33,209
Nice catch, Abby.

262
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,780
Yeah.

263
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:37,689
I couldn't help but notice
how quiet it is in here.

264
00:11:37,736 --> 00:11:39,904
- Where's the music?
- I just wasn't in the mood.

265
00:11:39,905 --> 00:11:41,030
Anything...

266
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,438
you want to talk about?

267
00:11:43,905 --> 00:11:45,320
Why would there be?

268
00:11:46,593 --> 00:11:48,367
Yeah, I don't know,
it's just that McGee said

269
00:11:48,368 --> 00:11:49,857
that you weren't really
acting like yourself,

270
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:51,395
- and so I thought...
- So you guys have been

271
00:11:51,452 --> 00:11:52,858
talking about me?

272
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:53,958
Yeah. No.

273
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:58,017
We're wondering if there
was anything bothering you.

274
00:11:58,052 --> 00:11:59,658
You want to know what bothers me?

275
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:03,710
It bothers me when people
gossip about other people

276
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,080
behind their backs.

277
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,219
Do you really think that that is okay?

278
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,431
Yeah. 'Cause...

279
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:13,219
I mean, it's the only way to gossip.

280
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,783
'Cause if we talked about you in front

281
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:16,531
of your face, then that would
just be talking about you.

282
00:12:16,532 --> 00:12:18,157
You know what, we're just not gonna...

283
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:19,841
we're not gonna do that anymore.

284
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,373
Sorry.

285
00:12:22,595 --> 00:12:23,847
Your aunt lived with you?

286
00:12:23,848 --> 00:12:25,793
When she was in town, yes.

287
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:28,158
You're sure she was murdered?

288
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:31,221
Preliminary findings have been
inconclusive, Mr. Torrance,

289
00:12:31,222 --> 00:12:32,777
but it's probable.

290
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:34,595
When was the last time you saw her?

291
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:37,136
It's been almost three months now.

292
00:12:37,162 --> 00:12:39,472
And you never filed a
missing persons report?

293
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:40,948
Well, she does this.

294
00:12:41,222 --> 00:12:44,937
She would meet a new man
with a yacht or a jet...

295
00:12:45,787 --> 00:12:47,534
and disappear for a while.

296
00:12:47,535 --> 00:12:51,035
We always expected she
would resurface eventually.

297
00:12:51,724 --> 00:12:53,259
Just never like this.

298
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:58,911
Here.

299
00:12:59,163 --> 00:13:03,350
I know how difficult it is to
lose a person you care about.

300
00:13:03,351 --> 00:13:04,351
Thank you.

301
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:07,787
We'll also need a list

302
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,975
of anyone who has access to your home.

303
00:13:09,976 --> 00:13:12,861
Contractors, workmen, employees.

304
00:13:12,913 --> 00:13:15,475
And also the names of any
of her travel companions

305
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:17,311
- or associates.
- Of course.

306
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:20,666
Thank you for coming in so quickly.

307
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:21,852
If you learn anything...

308
00:13:21,853 --> 00:13:24,228
Please call. As soon as we know more.

309
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,495
They were really cut up.

310
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:31,352
Sorry.

311
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:32,966
It's a poor choice of words.

312
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:35,166
How many more of these
are we going to do?

313
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:36,522
Uh, at least five.

314
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:37,779
So pace yourself.

315
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,278
What do you mean by that, McGee?

316
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,979
Nothing. Just, you know,

317
00:13:43,037 --> 00:13:44,859
you got a little emotional in there.

318
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:48,186
I will meet you upstairs,
Miss Dalton, okay?

319
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:49,255
Okay.

320
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:53,728
Next of kin?

321
00:13:53,922 --> 00:13:54,969
Abby thinks there might be more

322
00:13:55,011 --> 00:13:57,039
body parts hidden in
her grandfather's crypt.

323
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,041
You talked to Abby?

324
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:00,416
- Yeah, McGee.
- I was right, wasn't I?

325
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:01,541
There's something wrong.

326
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:02,897
Let it go, probie.

327
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:05,914
- Why?
- Because I'm pretty sure

328
00:14:06,104 --> 00:14:07,479
it's something you did.

329
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,554
Well, what did I do?

330
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:10,249
Well, think about it, probie.

331
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:11,754
I'm sure you'll come up with something.

332
00:14:17,418 --> 00:14:19,759
I don't understand what I'm
supposed to be looking at.

333
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,754
These photos are of
your grandfather's tomb.

334
00:14:24,355 --> 00:14:25,355
I get that.

335
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:28,348
I assure you this has nothing
to do with your grandfather.

336
00:14:28,413 --> 00:14:31,105
How could it? He's been dead 13 years.

337
00:14:31,106 --> 00:14:33,231
- I was at the funeral.
- Right.

338
00:14:33,543 --> 00:14:35,781
It's been tampered with, okay?

339
00:14:35,782 --> 00:14:38,668
And we believe that there's
evidence hidden inside

340
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,795
relating to an ongoing
murder investigation.

341
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,391
What kind of evidence?

342
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:45,795
I run my own business, Agent DiNozzo.

343
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:47,871
That means I'm losing
money every minute that

344
00:14:47,872 --> 00:14:49,262
I have to spend here.

345
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:50,844
So why don't you just tell me

346
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:52,420
what it is that you want from me?

347
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:59,973
We need you to give us
permission to open it.

348
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,252
So if you could just sign...

349
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:04,018
these authorization forms.

350
00:15:04,274 --> 00:15:07,209
My dad put me to work
right after my grandpa died.

351
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,408
You know the first
lesson that I learned?

352
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,609
What's that?

353
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,864
Don't sign any papers without
having a lawyer look at 'em.

354
00:15:15,986 --> 00:15:17,576
That's a good lesson.

355
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:19,331
But if it's necessary,

356
00:15:20,145 --> 00:15:21,755
we'll get a federal warrant.

357
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,235
Oh, that would be much easier for me.

358
00:15:24,236 --> 00:15:25,594
You should just do that.

359
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:28,016
Okay.

360
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:29,702
Anything else you need?

361
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,454
Just a federal warrant.

362
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Great.

363
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:43,369
Company, boss.

364
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,397
Special Agent Gibbs.

365
00:15:47,678 --> 00:15:48,678
Colonel Mann.

366
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:51,988
I got a call your case might
be venturing into CID territory.

367
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:53,704
That call was premature.

368
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:57,539
Really? Here I thought
it was four weeks overdue.

369
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,177
I understand you were denied permission

370
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:05,108
by the family to access
Colonel Dalton's crypt.

371
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:08,486
Got a warrant.

372
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:10,629
And that got my attention.

373
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,143
Why don't you fill me in.

374
00:16:15,114 --> 00:16:17,490
Wouldn't want to make a bad
situation worse, would you?

375
00:16:19,864 --> 00:16:21,614
Don't look so nervous, Jethro.

376
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:23,427
- Do I look nervous?
- No.

377
00:16:23,428 --> 00:16:25,143
You actually look, um...

378
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:27,026
you look pretty good.

379
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:32,332
David, DiNozzo, perimeter.

380
00:16:34,116 --> 00:16:36,367
Sure you don't want us to
help you in there, boss?

381
00:16:37,868 --> 00:16:39,304
'Course not, 'cause if
you did, you would've said,

382
00:16:39,305 --> 00:16:41,181
"David, DiNozzo, follow me."

383
00:16:41,182 --> 00:16:42,262
Probie, stop it.

384
00:16:43,494 --> 00:16:44,724
We're not going anywhere.

385
00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:46,839
Why? What'd I miss?

386
00:16:48,794 --> 00:16:51,116
Not like you to leave
something unfinished.

387
00:16:51,117 --> 00:16:52,297
The crime scene.

388
00:16:52,682 --> 00:16:54,282
Ever worry you're slipping?

389
00:16:54,283 --> 00:16:55,283
No.

390
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,482
Any suspects yet?

391
00:16:57,807 --> 00:16:58,992
Nothing concrete.

392
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,995
What does your gut say?

393
00:17:00,996 --> 00:17:03,176
Theory is it's an inside job.

394
00:17:03,183 --> 00:17:04,994
But you don't like that.

395
00:17:04,995 --> 00:17:06,880
So how else would he know

396
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:10,429
which crypts are vacant?

397
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:13,278
Ah, read the faceplates.

398
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:16,151
So the warrant didn't exactly specify

399
00:17:16,197 --> 00:17:17,684
what we're looking for here.

400
00:17:17,985 --> 00:17:20,556
Well, it's best to
not have expectations.

401
00:17:20,557 --> 00:17:22,572
It staves off disappointment.

402
00:17:24,496 --> 00:17:26,206
What are we hoping for?

403
00:17:26,557 --> 00:17:30,392
You throw that "we" word
around pretty casually.

404
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,845
The last time someone tried to remove
one of these, it blew up in his face.

405
00:17:40,873 --> 00:17:43,496
You might want to
step back a little bit.

406
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:45,447
Thank you for your concern.

407
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:56,059
I see what you mean.

408
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,260
Expectations.

409
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:02,211
Gibbs did not look happy to see her.

410
00:18:03,312 --> 00:18:04,435
His body language suggested

411
00:18:04,436 --> 00:18:06,621
he was not comfortable at all.

412
00:18:06,623 --> 00:18:08,747
Eh, nothing makes Gibbs uncomfortable.

413
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:10,168
Nothing job-related.

414
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,622
You think he ended it with her?

415
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:14,811
Assuming that he started something.

416
00:18:14,812 --> 00:18:16,042
I don't buy it.

417
00:18:16,124 --> 00:18:17,873
- Why not?
- For one, she's not a redhead.

418
00:18:17,874 --> 00:18:19,123
People do change, Tony.

419
00:18:19,124 --> 00:18:21,019
It's true, even you have a girlfriend.

420
00:18:22,562 --> 00:18:23,749
I haven't changed.

421
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,937
Really? What about the
pretty girl in the office.

422
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,000
- Natalie Dalton?
- Well, you noticed she was pretty,

423
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:29,249
but you didn't flirt with her.

424
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,561
That would've been unprofessional.

425
00:18:30,562 --> 00:18:31,562
I don't know.

426
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,314
Might have gotten her to
sign the authorization.

427
00:18:33,315 --> 00:18:35,562
Then we would not have need the warrant.

428
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:37,689
Then Colonel Mann
wouldn't have been here.

429
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,015
And we would be inside doing our job.

430
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:42,190
- Like professionals.
- All because

431
00:18:42,191 --> 00:18:44,251
you don't flirt anymore. Why is that?

432
00:18:44,252 --> 00:18:46,903

- Enough gossip, McGee.
- Tony, you like to talk about

433
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:48,455
everyone's private lives.

434
00:18:49,252 --> 00:18:50,852
Talk, yes.

435
00:18:51,378 --> 00:18:53,615
But I don't write entire
books about them, do I?

436
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:55,939
Does create a bit of a trust...

437
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,940
issue, McGee.

438
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,063
Excuse me. Hi.

439
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:01,627
Am I able to go inside today?

440
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:03,758
The mausoleum is closed, sir.

441
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:09,191
Here it is.

442
00:19:15,442 --> 00:19:16,940
Are you gonna let me in?

443
00:19:16,941 --> 00:19:19,880
I think we should be clear
on the implications first.

444
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:21,817
You're interfering
with my investigation.

445
00:19:21,818 --> 00:19:24,066
- Is that what I'm doing?
- Honestly, I'm not sure.

446
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:25,693
If there's evidence in here,

447
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:27,943
I'm gonna be obligated to
see this through to the end.

448
00:19:27,944 --> 00:19:29,567
- And if there's not?
- Then I don't see

449
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,363
why my involvement
shouldn't end right here.

450
00:19:38,508 --> 00:19:40,006
If you wanted to see me,

451
00:19:40,007 --> 00:19:42,506
you didn't have to manufacture a reason.

452
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:44,944
I follow the orders of
the United States Army,

453
00:19:44,945 --> 00:19:47,320
even when they don't exactly make sense.

454
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:49,630
- You could've called.
- So could you.

455
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,444
I distinctly remember
the last thing you said

456
00:19:51,445 --> 00:19:52,882
as you were slinking
out of my bedroom...

457
00:19:52,883 --> 00:19:54,742
- I don't slink.
- "I'll call you."

458
00:19:54,785 --> 00:19:56,444
For the record, I didn't
think the last time

459
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,169
we saw each other was gonna be
the last time we saw each other.

460
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,500
Neither did I.

461
00:20:00,697 --> 00:20:02,452
Well, here we are.

462
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:04,032
Lucky for us.

463
00:20:04,198 --> 00:20:05,598
Call it fate.

464
00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:07,941
You're just gonna let fate decide

465
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:09,875
whether we go our separate ways?

466
00:20:10,758 --> 00:20:12,293
Five bodies in total.

467
00:20:13,322 --> 00:20:15,134
We've only recovered portions.

468
00:20:15,135 --> 00:20:16,570
You're hoping the rest

469
00:20:16,571 --> 00:20:17,622
- are in here.
- Aren't you?

470
00:20:18,823 --> 00:20:20,853
Honestly, I'm not really sure.

471
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,359
That the answer you're looking for?

472
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:41,895
If the bodies recovered from
the mausoleum were, in fact,

473
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,790
the result of mass murder,

474
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:47,113
one might expect a certain modicum

475
00:20:47,172 --> 00:20:49,255
of consistency in the manner of death.

476
00:20:49,257 --> 00:20:50,257
One might.

477
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:52,048
Yes. And one would be wrong.

478
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,445
Shot, stabbed, strangled, bludgeoned,

479
00:20:57,065 --> 00:21:01,210
and poor Miss Undetermined Torrance.

480
00:21:01,297 --> 00:21:02,849
Three women, two men,

481
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,645
ages ranging from 19 to 70.

482
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:07,965
Three are Caucasian,

483
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,554
one Asian, and one black.

484
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:12,549
- No common traits.
- Not in life.

485
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:16,050
But the blood, however,
settled on different surfaces

486
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:17,422
on each of the bodies.

487
00:21:17,423 --> 00:21:19,109
Her left thigh and back,

488
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,298
his chest and buttocks, meaning...

489
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:23,609
The bodies were moved repeatedly.

490
00:21:23,612 --> 00:21:25,422
Precisely. They were
killed and then moved

491
00:21:25,423 --> 00:21:27,493
for some sort of preparation.

492
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:29,423
You can see the
indentations on the ankles

493
00:21:29,424 --> 00:21:32,393
here and here, here.

494
00:21:32,394 --> 00:21:33,439
Chain-link.

495
00:21:33,924 --> 00:21:35,099
Yes. I believe the bodies

496
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,735
were suspended and drained
prior to being, well,

497
00:21:39,177 --> 00:21:40,423
there's only one word for it.

498
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,424
Butchered.

499
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:43,676
We sent the tissue samples
to Abby. Hopefully, she can...

500
00:21:44,677 --> 00:21:46,092
Speak of the devil.

501
00:21:46,302 --> 00:21:49,322
What we have here is
paradoxical behavior.

502
00:21:49,488 --> 00:21:51,198
On one side, we have...

503
00:21:51,302 --> 00:21:53,553
An emotional, unrestrained murderer

504
00:21:53,554 --> 00:21:55,612
using whatever means at hand.

505
00:21:55,613 --> 00:21:58,253
Yes. And, on the other,
someone tidy, meticulous,

506
00:21:58,254 --> 00:22:00,114
and almost flawless

507
00:22:00,303 --> 00:22:03,023
in the way he dissected these bodies.

508
00:22:03,802 --> 00:22:04,989
That wasn't Abby.

509
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,740
That was the Director.
She wants to see you.

510
00:22:09,115 --> 00:22:10,315
Both of you.

511
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:18,802
As far as we can tell,

512
00:22:18,803 --> 00:22:20,679
the only thing that brought
these people together

513
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,366
is how they were taken apart.

514
00:22:22,367 --> 00:22:24,115
In addition to Marilyn Torrance,

515
00:22:24,116 --> 00:22:27,490
we have a 19-year-old runaway
from Florida. He was shot.

516
00:22:27,491 --> 00:22:29,146
30-year-old
prostitute.

517
00:22:29,617 --> 00:22:30,803
She was strangled.

518
00:22:30,804 --> 00:22:32,743
No next of kin on either of them.

519
00:22:32,744 --> 00:22:35,428
Wade Carlin, 26-year-old
Georgetown graduate

520
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:37,991
- from Michigan.
- He broke off contact with his parents

521
00:22:37,992 --> 00:22:40,617
after his girlfriend
dumped him six months ago.

522
00:22:40,618 --> 00:22:43,244
They thought he was Jack
Kerouac-ing around the country.

523
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:44,804
When, in fact, he was stabbed to death

524
00:22:44,805 --> 00:22:46,244
a few weeks after the breakup.

525
00:22:46,245 --> 00:22:49,692
All missing persons cases.
All have led to nowhere.

526
00:22:49,693 --> 00:22:50,693
Until now.

527
00:22:51,994 --> 00:22:52,994
Gloria Grady,

528
00:22:53,058 --> 00:22:55,493
age 72. Ducky says she
was the first victim.

529
00:22:55,494 --> 00:22:56,494
Blunt trauma.

530
00:22:56,619 --> 00:22:58,305
Only one relative, her son,

531
00:22:59,548 --> 00:23:00,548
Len Grady.

532
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,396
He was at James River.

533
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,806
With a bouquet of flowers.

534
00:23:03,807 --> 00:23:06,115
Lilies. For who?

535
00:23:06,995 --> 00:23:08,994
No record of any Grady at James River.

536
00:23:08,995 --> 00:23:10,369
Could be under a different name.

537
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,519
Could be a friend.

538
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,494
But lilies. They're feminine.

539
00:23:13,495 --> 00:23:15,119
The kind you give to a woman.

540
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,360
Like your mother.

541
00:23:17,747 --> 00:23:21,117
Grady's mother. I
don't know your mother.

542
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,432
Could be visiting his trophies.

543
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:27,033
Fits the classic profile:
30s, single, white.

544
00:23:28,062 --> 00:23:29,371
We should tell Gibbs.

545
00:23:29,372 --> 00:23:30,932
Yeah? Why don't we
wait till he gets out?

546
00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:33,685
Unlessyouwant to be the one
to interrupt his meeting.

547
00:23:33,686 --> 00:23:34,866
Campfire's over.

548
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:38,061
Okay. Well, thank you, Colonel.

549
00:23:38,062 --> 00:23:40,602
I will get her back to
you as soon as possible.

550
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:43,872
Your superiors have agreed

551
00:23:43,873 --> 00:23:46,248
to loan us your
services for the interim.

552
00:23:46,249 --> 00:23:48,596
I trust that there's
not a problem with that?

553
00:23:48,697 --> 00:23:49,997
No. Of course not, Director.

554
00:23:49,998 --> 00:23:52,498
As long as Special Agent Gibbs
continues to be forthcoming

555
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:54,339
with pertinent information.

556
00:23:55,123 --> 00:23:56,123
Agent Gibbs?

557
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,946
As long as she follows my
lead, I can't foresee a problem.

558
00:24:01,564 --> 00:24:04,799
You two have worked cases
together successfully in the past.

559
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:05,998
Nothing's changed

560
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:09,294
to interfere with that professional
relationship, has there?

561
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,876
What do we have so far?

562
00:24:14,877 --> 00:24:17,252
Four confirmed homicides. Likely, five.

563
00:24:17,253 --> 00:24:19,064
- That's all you know?
- I know we're wasting time

564
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:20,999
debating jurisdictional protocol

565
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,499
and discussing who's entitled to what.

566
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,925
Well, then, why don't
you get back to it?

567
00:24:24,926 --> 00:24:26,065
Yeah. Thank you.

568
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:27,066
Not you,

569
00:24:27,126 --> 00:24:28,126
Colonel Mann.

570
00:24:28,754 --> 00:24:31,179
I'd like to have a
private word with you.

571
00:24:42,503 --> 00:24:44,113
Breaking in a new pair?

572
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:47,066
No. I always wear these.
Why do I always wear these?

573
00:24:47,067 --> 00:24:49,192
- Let me see your shoes.
- Okay.

574
00:24:51,192 --> 00:24:55,072
Flat, sensible, functional.
Not very sexy, but..

575
00:24:55,141 --> 00:24:58,237
- But they do the trick. - What
do I want three-inch platforms?

576
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,317
I'm already five-ten.

577
00:24:59,318 --> 00:25:01,691
I love these shoes... just all wrong.

578
00:25:01,692 --> 00:25:02,752
Wrong for who?

579
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:06,177
The tissue samples.

580
00:25:06,693 --> 00:25:07,868
I don't follow.

581
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,380
You don't want to hear about shoes.

582
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:11,755
- You want to hearabout tissue samples.
- Sure.

583
00:25:11,756 --> 00:25:14,069
I ran the Torrance tissues
through the mass spec,

584
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,381
and I found abnormal levels of chlorine.

585
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:17,656
- Chlorine?
- Yeah.

586
00:25:17,657 --> 00:25:19,027
Like in a swimming pool.

587
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,293
Len Grady's Website.

588
00:25:21,443 --> 00:25:23,380
He's a jack-of-all-trades.
Basically,

589
00:25:23,381 --> 00:25:24,504
a guy with a big van.

590
00:25:24,505 --> 00:25:25,882
And a little initiative.

591
00:25:25,883 --> 00:25:27,942
Something of an amateur entrepreneur.

592
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,380
That's not easy to say.

593
00:25:29,381 --> 00:25:31,740
Carpenter, plumber,
gardener, electrician,

594
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:32,757
TV installations,

595
00:25:32,758 --> 00:25:34,347
- snow shoveling..
- But, most importantly,

596
00:25:34,352 --> 00:25:35,357
pool cleaning.

597
00:25:35,358 --> 00:25:36,757
That supposed to mean something?

598
00:25:36,758 --> 00:25:37,819
Well, he's not just any pool man.

599
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,258
He's the Torrances' pool man.

600
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:40,506
Grady's got his own key.

601
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:43,306
Heated. Indoor. Regular monthly
maintenance. I looked into it.

602
00:25:43,384 --> 00:25:45,758
Royalty checks burning a
hole in your pocket, McGee?

603
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,383
Already tied Grady to his mother.

604
00:25:47,384 --> 00:25:48,564
Body number one.

605
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,631
- And now Torrance.
- Body number two.

606
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,102
Let's bring him in.

607
00:26:00,273 --> 00:26:01,321
A lot of people

608
00:26:01,322 --> 00:26:04,445
were pleased to see
Sharif off the streets.

609
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:07,917
My superiors acknowledged
your letter of commendation.

610
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:09,821
I want you to know I appreciate it.

611
00:26:09,822 --> 00:26:11,821
The two make an effective team.

612
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,062
Gibbs and myself?

613
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:15,747
Well, it wasn't just a
flash in the pan, was it?

614
00:26:16,262 --> 00:26:19,272
Your service at CID is up in six months.

615
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,822
You must have started considering life

616
00:26:21,823 --> 00:26:23,134
after the military.

617
00:26:23,135 --> 00:26:24,509
Yes. It has crossed my mind.

618
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,262
The question is how to
best serve your future.

619
00:26:27,263 --> 00:26:30,288
Where the opportunity
for advancement lies.

620
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,199
It's not too early
for a cocktail, is it?

621
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,445
The sun must be down somewhere.

622
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:38,075
You drink bourbon?

623
00:26:38,076 --> 00:26:39,997
No. Not regularly.

624
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:44,138
Spend enough time around
Gibbs, and you'll learn.

625
00:26:44,825 --> 00:26:45,825
Believe me.

626
00:26:46,765 --> 00:26:48,675
It's an acquired taste.

627
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:51,741
And when did you first acquire it?

628
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:53,987
It's been a while.

629
00:26:56,264 --> 00:26:59,034
But it's something that
stays with you though.

630
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:11,765
Nobody's home, Boss.

631
00:27:11,766 --> 00:27:13,950
Neighbor said he went
out about an hour ago.

632
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:15,066
What do we do?

633
00:27:15,451 --> 00:27:16,451
We wait.

634
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,390
Okay.

635
00:27:19,891 --> 00:27:21,826
Colonel Mann still in with the Director?

636
00:27:21,827 --> 00:27:23,314
What do you think they're talking about?

637
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:25,445
We wait...

638
00:27:26,123 --> 00:27:27,473
...silently.

639
00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:29,891
Okay.

640
00:27:34,142 --> 00:27:35,142
I got him.

641
00:27:36,008 --> 00:27:37,108
Len Grady?

642
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:39,329
Freeze!

643
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,595
Federal agents.

644
00:27:47,686 --> 00:27:49,235
Up, up, up!

645
00:27:51,393 --> 00:27:53,168
What? What?

646
00:28:04,018 --> 00:28:05,143
Bachelor living.

647
00:28:05,331 --> 00:28:06,691
Not every bachelor.

648
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:13,768
This guy's got a card for everything.

649
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:15,249
"Len Grady, Painter."

650
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:17,348
"Len Grady, Fountain Design."

651
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:19,708
"Cottage cheese ceilings removed

652
00:28:19,709 --> 00:28:20,949
and made smooth."

653
00:28:21,272 --> 00:28:24,584
Anything with a blade on
it, we should get to Abby.

654
00:28:24,585 --> 00:28:26,075
Not really what she wants.

655
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:28,838
She's upset about her shoes.

656
00:28:28,896 --> 00:28:30,085
Doesn't sound like Abby.

657
00:28:30,086 --> 00:28:32,709
Wrong pair of shoes can
reduce a woman to tears.

658
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,830
She was crying?

659
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:34,834
Practically.

660
00:28:35,273 --> 00:28:36,743
It's not the shoes.

661
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:40,194
Got something.

662
00:28:40,584 --> 00:28:41,597
Yep.

663
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:43,818
White paper package

664
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:45,489
tied with brown string.

665
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:47,711
What's that?

666
00:28:49,274 --> 00:28:50,624
It's a pork chop.

667
00:28:51,835 --> 00:28:53,910
- Hear you got our guy in there.
- Maybe.

668
00:28:55,523 --> 00:28:57,228
- What?
- Nothing.

669
00:28:57,712 --> 00:28:59,335
It seems like you were
thinking something.

670
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:00,647
That's been known to happen.

671
00:29:00,648 --> 00:29:02,008
Something about me.

672
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,836
Thought I recognized your perfume.

673
00:29:03,837 --> 00:29:05,427
I don't wear perfume.

674
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,390
Must have been something else.

675
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:11,811
So... can I just go ahead

676
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:12,989
and pay the fine and get out of here?

677
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,084
Fine?

678
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:16,721
I know I shouldn't have cashed

679
00:29:16,762 --> 00:29:18,528
my mother's Social Security checks.

680
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:20,311
We're not the IRS.

681
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,901
She went missing last March.

682
00:29:23,902 --> 00:29:25,142
She had dementia.

683
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:28,030
It was getting worse. She
must have gotten out one day.

684
00:29:28,301 --> 00:29:30,649
We're talking about a
person here, not a dog.

685
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,714
I keep hoping she'll come back.

686
00:29:32,715 --> 00:29:34,915
You already know where to find her.

687
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:36,962
How do I know that?

688
00:29:36,963 --> 00:29:38,338
You went to visit her.

689
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:39,759
Brought her flowers.

690
00:29:42,216 --> 00:29:44,151
My mother's at the cemetery?

691
00:29:44,152 --> 00:29:46,707
What's left of her. She was dismembered.

692
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,747
Look at his mind spinning.

693
00:29:52,216 --> 00:29:54,041
He's trying to figure
out how to play it.

694
00:29:56,841 --> 00:29:58,191
I didn't do that.

695
00:30:02,028 --> 00:30:03,904
I took care of my mother.

696
00:30:03,905 --> 00:30:05,528
I fed her.

697
00:30:06,841 --> 00:30:08,551
I cleaned up after her.

698
00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:12,653
You must have been
praying for it to end.

699
00:30:12,654 --> 00:30:14,009
I loved my mother!

700
00:30:14,405 --> 00:30:15,871
Maybe you were right the first time.

701
00:30:15,922 --> 00:30:17,653
It must have been like
putting down a dog.

702
00:30:17,654 --> 00:30:19,466
Only no one ever noticed.

703
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:21,880
Getting away with it must have
been the real shocking part.

704
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:25,500
And a new career is born.

705
00:30:25,635 --> 00:30:26,697
You did it again...

706
00:30:27,095 --> 00:30:28,095
and again.

707
00:30:28,695 --> 00:30:31,145
Kelly Camarda, Wade...

708
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:33,576
Something's not right.

709
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,015
What do you mean?

710
00:30:35,343 --> 00:30:36,943
He looks relieved.

711
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,220
Gloria Grady.

712
00:30:41,781 --> 00:30:42,781
Okay.

713
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:44,384
Stop.

714
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:46,782
You have something you want to tell us?

715
00:30:46,783 --> 00:30:49,208
All these people were chopped up?

716
00:30:49,969 --> 00:30:51,269
That's disgusting.

717
00:30:53,469 --> 00:30:56,221
What kind of person do
you think could do that?

718
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:58,997
I mean, you're looking for a monster.

719
00:30:59,846 --> 00:31:01,906
What do you want me to say?

720
00:31:02,098 --> 00:31:03,098
It's not me.

721
00:31:13,647 --> 00:31:14,847
What now?

722
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,033
Want me to do a lie-detector
test or something?

723
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:19,669
You just did.

724
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,909
He's telling the truth.

725
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,440
You think I'm wrong?

726
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,471
No. But he was relieved when

727
00:31:26,472 --> 00:31:28,347
you connected her with
the rest of the bodies.

728
00:31:28,348 --> 00:31:30,647
He has no feelings about them at all.

729
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:33,034
- Doesn't mean he wasn't involved.
- Maybe.

730
00:31:33,035 --> 00:31:35,099
But that doesn't look like
a man who feels trapped.

731
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,334
That looks like a man who
knows he has a way out.

732
00:31:38,535 --> 00:31:40,349
There's something much worse than

733
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,825
Len Grady out there.

734
00:31:43,536 --> 00:31:45,421
Only he knows what it is.

735
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,082
We've got to push Grady harder
to tell us what he knows.

736
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:55,097
He won't.

737
00:31:55,102 --> 00:31:56,607
You think he's protecting
the real killer?

738
00:31:56,608 --> 00:31:57,668
He's protecting himself.

739
00:31:57,669 --> 00:31:59,819
I can prove that he's not acting alone.

740
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:03,983
Trying to run down Grady's van.

741
00:32:03,984 --> 00:32:05,045
No luck so far.

742
00:32:05,046 --> 00:32:06,360
He was on foot when you apprehended him.

743
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:07,421
So what did he do with his ride?

744
00:32:07,422 --> 00:32:08,793
And when did he do it?

745
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:10,673
After he spotted us at the cemetery.

746
00:32:10,674 --> 00:32:12,424
What, he just happened to be visiting?

747
00:32:12,425 --> 00:32:14,113
There's no such thing as a coincidence.

748
00:32:14,114 --> 00:32:16,862
Well, he wanted information.
He was there to watch us.

749
00:32:16,863 --> 00:32:19,051
But he got there as quickly as I did,

750
00:32:19,052 --> 00:32:20,798
so how did he know
about the investigation?

751
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,049
He's got a friend on the inside.

752
00:32:22,835 --> 00:32:24,656
One person's a psychopath,

753
00:32:24,691 --> 00:32:25,987
two people's a conspiracy.

754
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:27,873
So who was he talking to?

755
00:32:28,161 --> 00:32:29,551
Grady doesn't leave here

756
00:32:29,552 --> 00:32:31,551
until we know everything about him.

757
00:32:31,552 --> 00:32:33,987
You start with yesterday
and you work backwards.

758
00:32:38,676 --> 00:32:39,676
Go.

759
00:32:41,677 --> 00:32:42,677
Forensics?

760
00:32:43,616 --> 00:32:44,861
- Boss...
- Yeah.

761
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,241
If you're going to go see Abby,

762
00:32:52,242 --> 00:32:53,740
I think you should know she's
going through something...

763
00:32:53,741 --> 00:32:56,281
I'm not going empty-handed, McGee.

764
00:32:57,428 --> 00:32:58,428
Gibbs.

765
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:01,552
- And Lieutenant Colonel Mann.
- Abby.

766
00:33:01,553 --> 00:33:03,865
Can I interest you in some knives?

767
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:07,117
I've got kitchen knives,
pen knives, pocket knives,

768
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:10,366
Swiss army knives, razor
blades, X-acto blades,

769
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:13,217
scissors, saws,
scalpels, hedge clippers,

770
00:33:14,055 --> 00:33:17,079
an adze, an awl, a fish scaler

771
00:33:17,114 --> 00:33:19,056
and even a golf-hole cutter.

772
00:33:19,505 --> 00:33:21,990
All recovered from Grady's pigsty?

773
00:33:23,757 --> 00:33:27,255
Reflected in the care he
used to maintain his cutlery,

774
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:30,151
there's dings and nicks and dull edges.

775
00:33:30,194 --> 00:33:33,069
None of these correspond to
any of the precise incisions

776
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,757
used to dismember the corpses.

777
00:33:34,758 --> 00:33:35,993
For such a slob,

778
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:38,880
he certainly is careful when it counts.

779
00:33:38,881 --> 00:33:41,194
There wasn't a single trace
of human blood anywhere.

780
00:33:41,195 --> 00:33:42,500
Human blood...

781
00:33:42,758 --> 00:33:44,818
Your boy Grady is
something of a carnivore.

782
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:46,446
From the remnants on his silverware,

783
00:33:46,447 --> 00:33:48,946
I could pretty much tell you
every meal he had for a week.

784
00:33:48,947 --> 00:33:50,492
Liverwurst, knockwurst,

785
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:53,134
pastrami, roast beef, rack of lamb.

786
00:33:53,135 --> 00:33:54,610
Which leads us to...

787
00:33:55,982 --> 00:33:57,139
this.

788
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,125
The pork chop from his freezer.

789
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:05,463
Probably his next meal.

790
00:34:05,498 --> 00:34:07,221
When I pull it up, it
gets really interesting.

791
00:34:07,822 --> 00:34:10,199
It matches the incisions on the bodies.

792
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,923
Tool mark analysis isn't as precise

793
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:13,449
as say fingerprints or ballistics,

794
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:15,884
but I can conclusively tell
you that none of the blades

795
00:34:15,885 --> 00:34:18,360
in Grady's possession carved that pig.

796
00:34:18,361 --> 00:34:19,796
Well, why would they?

797
00:34:20,698 --> 00:34:22,788
He probably had it carved.

798
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:27,677
His partner's a butcher.

799
00:34:31,575 --> 00:34:33,575
Don't you have work to do?

800
00:34:33,887 --> 00:34:35,657
Look, it's not something

801
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:39,547
that you can fix in the classic
Gibbs hit-and-run style, okay?

802
00:34:43,387 --> 00:34:44,922
I got time, Abs.

803
00:34:47,387 --> 00:34:48,387
It's stupid.

804
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:50,364
It's just...

805
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:52,390
... a guy.

806
00:34:52,953 --> 00:34:55,076
I'm not going to start spilling my guts

807
00:34:55,077 --> 00:34:57,682
just because you keep standing here.

808
00:35:01,514 --> 00:35:04,764
All right, apparently
I am too much for him.

809
00:35:04,789 --> 00:35:05,888
Can you imagine that?

810
00:35:05,889 --> 00:35:06,889
Me?

811
00:35:07,202 --> 00:35:08,888
And it's not what you think.

812
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:10,982
It's not all this.

813
00:35:11,017 --> 00:35:12,190
He likes...

814
00:35:13,056 --> 00:35:14,788
he likes small women.

815
00:35:14,889 --> 00:35:17,839
I got dumped 'cause I'm too... too big.

816
00:35:19,015 --> 00:35:20,264
And don't even bother

817
00:35:20,265 --> 00:35:23,203
with the, "No, it's
him. He's too small."

818
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,265
or "If he can't accept
you for who you are

819
00:35:25,266 --> 00:35:27,326
then it's his problem," thing.

820
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:30,389
He just doesn't think
that we could make it work

821
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,630
and I've done everything I can

822
00:35:33,143 --> 00:35:35,493
to try to convince him that he's wrong.

823
00:35:39,016 --> 00:35:42,171
So I guess. I'm just
going to have to accept it.

824
00:35:46,457 --> 00:35:47,772
And let it go.

825
00:35:53,706 --> 00:35:55,011
Thanks, Gibbs.

826
00:35:56,269 --> 00:35:58,334
You always know what to say.

827
00:35:59,831 --> 00:36:02,392
Metro P. D. responded to
the BOLO on Grady's van.

828
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,818
So far 13 possibles and counting.

829
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:06,082
McGee.

830
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,973
Supermarkets, slaughter houses,

831
00:36:08,016 --> 00:36:09,306
any place with a butcher on site

832
00:36:09,352 --> 00:36:11,628
within a 20-block radius
of Grady's residence.

833
00:36:14,037 --> 00:36:16,267
Narrow the search to boutique shops.

834
00:36:16,282 --> 00:36:17,972
They'd need their privacy.

835
00:36:21,497 --> 00:36:22,594
There's just one.

836
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:23,595
Just one?

837
00:36:23,617 --> 00:36:25,282
Boutique butcher's a dying industry.

838
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,897
- Where?
- Le Cochon, Mass Avenue.

839
00:36:27,972 --> 00:36:29,346
All right, get a list of employees,

840
00:36:29,347 --> 00:36:30,962
owners past and present.

841
00:36:32,784 --> 00:36:33,784
Let's roll.

842
00:36:43,972 --> 00:36:44,972
Ms. Dalton.

843
00:36:47,537 --> 00:36:49,096
I thought you said you didn't need me.

844
00:36:49,097 --> 00:36:51,097
What's your relationship with Len Grady?

845
00:36:51,098 --> 00:36:53,161
Len, he's my boyfriend.
Why? What's going on?

846
00:36:53,162 --> 00:36:54,973
You told Grady you
spoke with us earlier?

847
00:36:54,974 --> 00:36:56,509
Yeah, I mentioned it.

848
00:36:58,598 --> 00:37:00,448
Is this about the investigation?

849
00:37:03,086 --> 00:37:04,098
Where is Len?

850
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:05,099
In custody.

851
00:37:06,286 --> 00:37:08,776
We suspect he's committed
at least five murders.

852
00:37:09,974 --> 00:37:11,163
That's impossible.

853
00:37:11,164 --> 00:37:13,114
Len would never hurt any...

854
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:14,850
Five?

855
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:16,039
At least.

856
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:19,446
Where's your freezer?

857
00:37:29,352 --> 00:37:30,600
Nothing in here, Boss.

858
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:32,351
Just pork, beef and lamb.

859
00:37:32,352 --> 00:37:34,182
What else would there be?

860
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:35,790
Human blood.

861
00:37:37,413 --> 00:37:38,413
Human?

862
00:37:38,914 --> 00:37:40,089
What's in here?

863
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,040
It's a freezer I use
for overflow to store

864
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:44,126
geese and turkeys in the holidays.

865
00:37:44,977 --> 00:37:45,977
Got a key?

866
00:37:52,915 --> 00:37:54,914
What kind of evidence
did you say that you found

867
00:37:54,915 --> 00:37:56,166
in my grandfather's crypt?

868

00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:58,476
Does Grady has access to your store?

869
00:37:58,477 --> 00:38:00,242
He's here all the time.

870
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:01,603
Look, this can't be happening, okay?

871
00:38:01,604 --> 00:38:03,729
There must be some kind of...

872
00:38:20,793 --> 00:38:22,683
He was a regular customer.

873
00:38:22,793 --> 00:38:24,628
Every week like clockwork.

874
00:38:25,481 --> 00:38:28,292
It was the only time that he
could get away from his mother.

875
00:38:28,293 --> 00:38:29,473
He felt trapped.

876
00:38:31,418 --> 00:38:34,080
I could tell that he needed
to get on with his life.

877
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:36,922
It started with a few
words here and there.

878
00:38:36,996 --> 00:38:38,024
And then...

879
00:38:39,671 --> 00:38:40,857
before long we were...

880
00:38:40,858 --> 00:38:41,858
Together.

881
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,230
Not fully, no.

882
00:38:43,606 --> 00:38:45,731
We didn't trade keys until...

883
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:49,003
after she disappeared.

884
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,267
He learned your trade.

885
00:38:56,359 --> 00:38:57,359
I taught him.

886
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:02,088
He always wanted to try new things.

887
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,695
I never suspected that...

888
00:39:08,048 --> 00:39:10,228
How could I not have seen it?

889
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:12,644
Love makes you blind.

890
00:39:16,473 --> 00:39:18,673
I must be some kind of monster.

891
00:39:23,798 --> 00:39:26,873
Is she the monster
you were talking about?

892
00:39:27,235 --> 00:39:28,738
No,

893
00:39:29,538 --> 00:39:30,985
she loves me.

894
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:32,052
How?

895
00:39:34,486 --> 00:39:35,601
We're in love.

896
00:39:35,923 --> 00:39:37,863
Then she had to know about it.

897
00:39:38,423 --> 00:39:40,486
She had to know the real you.

898
00:39:40,487 --> 00:39:42,197
She didn't do anything.

899
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:43,363
You're right.

900
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:45,422
She could have stopped you.

901
00:39:45,423 --> 00:39:47,433
She should have stopped you.

902
00:39:47,737 --> 00:39:48,912
If it was real.

903
00:39:49,486 --> 00:39:50,721
She didn't know!

904
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:53,241
I hid it. I hid everything.

905
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,310
Just leave her out of it.

906
00:39:57,915 --> 00:39:59,120
Natalie!

907
00:39:59,155 --> 00:40:01,101
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Natalie!

908
00:40:01,177 --> 00:40:03,005
I'm so sorry!

909
00:40:04,215 --> 00:40:06,776
I love you! I love you so much!

910
00:40:08,402 --> 00:40:09,957
I'm sorry!

911
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:12,884
Let's try this again. Marilyn Torrance.

912
00:40:13,114 --> 00:40:15,112
She was swimming in
her pool. I drowned her.

913
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:16,113
Wade Carlin.

914
00:40:16,237 --> 00:40:18,425
Natalie was at the wholesale market.

915
00:40:18,426 --> 00:40:20,053
He came in for a
sandwich. I stabbed him.

916
00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:21,113
She was a hooker.

917
00:40:21,114 --> 00:40:22,678
I was lonely. Natalie was out of town.

918
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:23,801
I strangled her.

919
00:40:23,802 --> 00:40:25,480
And the kid was nobody.

920
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:27,490
Nobody. I just shot him.

921
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:29,054
You kept them in the
freezer for over a year.

922
00:40:29,055 --> 00:40:30,530
Why'd you move the bodies?

923
00:40:31,004 --> 00:40:32,815
Why did you move them?

924
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:35,154
He needed the space.

925
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:37,893
No one could stop me.

926
00:40:37,992 --> 00:40:39,882
You were gonna kill again.

927
00:40:42,615 --> 00:40:43,735
He already did.

928
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,996
What did you do with the body?

929
00:40:47,493 --> 00:40:48,613
Doesn't matter.

930
00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:51,489
Doesn't matter.

931
00:40:52,488 --> 00:40:54,614
No, no... No. No!

932
00:40:56,182 --> 00:40:57,803
No! Natalie!

933
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:00,494
Find the van. Find the body.

934
00:41:03,182 --> 00:41:04,182
Let her go.

935
00:41:08,894 --> 00:41:09,992
Still at work?

936
00:41:09,993 --> 00:41:12,994
Yeah, I was just catching
up on some things.

937
00:41:12,995 --> 00:41:13,995
Cheek swabs.

938
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:18,439
Hey, your music's back on.

939
00:41:18,744 --> 00:41:19,930
You're feeling good again.

940
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:21,051
Maybe not good.

941
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:24,257
Not yet. But better.

942
00:41:24,807 --> 00:41:27,728
You know how sometimes a guy

943
00:41:27,783 --> 00:41:29,559
can get you all tied up inside.

944
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,660
Yes.

945
00:41:30,808 --> 00:41:33,370
And then you can't get the knots out?

946
00:41:33,371 --> 00:41:34,371
Yes.

947
00:41:34,809 --> 00:41:38,185
Well, it just really helped me
to talk things out with Gibbs.

948
00:41:38,186 --> 00:41:40,136
You know, unknot the knots.

949
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:43,060
'Cause even if you don't let it show,

950
00:41:43,061 --> 00:41:44,656
people can still tell.

951
00:41:47,245 --> 00:41:48,761
So, you know, if you ever want

952
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:50,112
to talk about Lieutenant Sanders...

953
00:41:50,117 --> 00:41:51,121
I liked him.

954
00:41:51,122 --> 00:41:52,774
He died. And,

955
00:41:53,509 --> 00:41:55,397
what else is there to say?

956
00:42:03,747 --> 00:42:04,747
Well,

957
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,877
I am glad you feel better.

958
00:42:13,312 --> 00:42:14,562
With the right partner,

959
00:42:14,563 --> 00:42:16,563
you can make the perfect, monster?

960
00:42:16,564 --> 00:42:17,564
Oh yeah,

961
00:42:17,567 --> 00:42:20,011
give me a little old-time romance.

962
00:42:21,813 --> 00:42:24,265
Someone's got hidden
skeletons of his own.

963
00:42:25,617 --> 00:42:28,703
You know, if I ever find
myself in a dire situation,

964
00:42:28,738 --> 00:42:30,748
the proverbial body
I need to get rid of...

965
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:32,634
I think I would tell you.

966
00:42:32,937 --> 00:42:34,062
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

967
00:42:40,001 --> 00:42:41,936
What makes you think
I wouldn't turn you in?

968
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:43,427
If there's one thing
you're good at, Jethro,

969
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:45,343
it's keeping your mouth shut.

970
00:42:45,567 --> 00:42:48,125
You made the right call
letting the girl go.

971
00:42:48,126 --> 00:42:51,452
Seems you always make the
call when it involves a case.

972
00:43:11,145 --> 00:43:12,145
Oh, son of a...
