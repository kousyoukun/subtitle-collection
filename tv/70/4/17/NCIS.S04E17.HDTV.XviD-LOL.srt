1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,900
In pain,we may find comfort,

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,400
in sorrow,hope,

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,300
in death,resurrection.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,700
Fire!

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,300
aim... fire!

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,700
Aim... fire!

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,100
Aim... fire!

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,200
They're almost finished out there, Ken.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,800
At do you want me to tell you,jack?
I can't get the damn thing open.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,100
What? Stripped?

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,500
Nah,it's catching.
It'just stuck or something.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,400
When was the last time 
you opened one of these things?

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,300
First one we've had 
since I've been here.

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,100
That's,like,what,a decade?

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,900
Yeah. Let me try.

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,900
okay,it's moving.

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,300
What's that smell?

18
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,300
you okay?

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,700
Navy NCIS

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:55,000
Season 4 episode 17
Sceletons

21
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,400
give me a dollar!

22
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,700
Okay.
What's wrong with that one?

23
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,100
The machine wouldn't take it 
and I want a candy bar.

24
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,100
-What's wrong with that candy r?
-It has nougat in it.

25
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,600
-But you hate nougat.
-I know!

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,000
It was a mistake,mcgee!Do you have a dollar?!

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,900
All I have are big bills.

28
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,600
-What is nougat?
-It's whipped dolphin fat.

29
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,000
No,that's the fiing in klowny kake.

30
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,800
That is a myth!

31
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,600
Would someone please give me a dollar?!

32
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,100
Sure,I got one.

33
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,300
Thanks.

34
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,100
God,it's like some kind of crime 
to not like nougat.

35
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,000
I dot even know what nougat is.

36
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,500
It's a cream 
made from sugar,honey and nuts.

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,900
Grab your gear.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,400
Got an explosion at a marine's funeral 
in james river national.

39
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,500
Did anyone else see 
what just happened there with abby?

40
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Yeah,she stole my dollar.

41
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,700
Last ones to the party.

42
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,700
It's not really a party 
until the bomb squad says it is.

43
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,400
What'd you find?

44
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
We got nothing.

45
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,700
No ordnae,

46
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,500
no residue,no electronics,

47
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,700
no time device,

48
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,100
no wiring,no remote.

49
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,600
No evidence of a bomb.

50
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,200
Except for the explosion.

51
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,900
We got two employees injured,
both vets.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,500
They were taken to the va 
with concussions and shrapnel wounds.

53
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Got names?

54
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,800
Former lance corporal lloyd jason,

55
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,600
36,and pfc kenneth dixon,25.

56
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,900
Veterans keep getting younger.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,200
The kid they were buryg was only 22.

58
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,200
-It's a family cry.
-Tandem?

59
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,100
His grandfather was in the back slot.

60
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,100
Still there as far as we could tell.

61
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,400
Your men cleared

62
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,100
fire readings are clean.

63
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,100
Air's safe to breathe,
not that I would recommend it.

64
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,000
-Anything else?-Yeah.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,800
You might want to cover your shoes.

66
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,700
That is truly appalling.

67
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,700
"Chief warrant officer mitchell waller."

68
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,400
Died,1978.

69
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,000
Should be the one in the back of the crypt.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,100
-He appears to be undisturbed.
-He would be the only one.

71
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,200
This is really the most 
disgusting thing I've ever seen.

72
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,700
And believe me,
that says a lot.It's like porridge.

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,400
The word is "effluvium;"

74
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,200
the result of decomposing 
human organs and tissue.

75
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,900
-This is pople?
-Yes,two,I'd say,judging bye the volume

76
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,600
And the two skulls,ofourse.

77
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,500
Mr.Palmer,we have to recover all of this.

78
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,400
One wevac for the soylent green 
coming right up.

79
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,100
Uh,somewhat claustrophobic.

80
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,600
And for all eternity.

81
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,700
Our friends here might agree with you.

82
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,400
They obviously needed to get out.

83
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,200
They didn't belong there in the first place.

84
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,300
Vents are definitely clogged.

85
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,500
Careful,doctor,

86
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,100
we still haven't found traces 
of what caused the explosion.

87
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,800
If my suspicns are correct,officer david,

88
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,300
the bomb is all around us.

89
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,800
It's a phenomenon in the death industry

90
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,200
informally referred to 
as"exploding casket syndrome."

91
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,100
Well,the floor's all yours,duck.

92
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,200
Thank you,jethro.

93
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,000
All bodies contain enzymes and bacteria.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,900
Immediately upon death,
they start to break down tissue.

95
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,200
Yes,a body can liquefy within a week,

96
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,700
especially if it hast been embalmed.

97
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:26,600
It's possible that these remains were human
in appeance as recently as two weeks ago.

98
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,600
-And someone dumped them in here.
-Yes,and in such a confined space,

99
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,900
as the gases were given off the bodies,

100
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,900
without y proper ventilation--
the crypt self could become a pressure cooker

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,800
The bodies were the bomb.

102
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,900
Not our first meat puzzle,doctor.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And it certainly won't be the last.

104
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,800
Never forget,mr. Palmer,

105
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,700
experience is the ultimate teacher.

106
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,800
Corner pieces are 
not as reliable as the singular components

107
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,300
Yes,as experience has taught us.

108
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,800
Skulls and torsos.

109
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,700
And judging by these pelvic structures,

110
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,600
we have a man and a woman.

111
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,000
Yes,well,lets put adam 
on the left and eve on the right.

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,700
This reminds me of a summer

113
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,100
when I assisted at 
an archaeological dig in north africa.

114
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:19,100
Our team unearthed two fossilized
neanderthals from a primitive burial mound:

115
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,500
One man,one woman.

116
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
This rib structure's fractured,doctor.

117
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Possibly from the force of the explosion?

118
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,700
Oh,no,no,no.

119
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,700
It's a clean,serrated edge.Very unlikely.

120
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:38,100
Did you know that the zulus burn all the
possessions of a dear departed to ward off evil?

121
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,800
Some tribes even throw spears

122
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,700
and shoot arrows into the air 
to kill hovering spirits.

123
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,400
Right ulna.

124
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,000
That evolved into the modern 
military tradition of firing a volley into the air

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,600
uh,right hand.

126
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,100
Yes,after the death of an african king--
right hand--

127
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,600
some of his subjects used to 
cut off fingers and toes.

128
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,000
It was considered a mark of respect.

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,600
Humerus.

130
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,800
I suppose it depends onhat you find funny.

131
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,400
Oh,rit,humerus.

132
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,200
right hand.

133
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,000
Didn't this happpn the last time?

134
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,200
We're gonna need another table.

135
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,300
The mausoleum doesn't get many visitors

136
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,200
which makes it a creative place 
to get rid of a few bodies,but...

137
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,000
whoever deposited them would first have to know

138
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,600
that a portion of chief waller's crypt 
was vacant.

139
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,400
That would suggest an inside job.

140
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,900
With the knowledge to access a sealed tomb.

141
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,900
Which would point to jackson or dixon.

142
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,600
If they hadn't practically blown themselves up.

143
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
What do you think,mcgee?

144
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,300
She definitely seemed un-abby.

145
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,400
-Who?
-Abby.

146
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,800
-Abby's unhappy?
-No,abby's un-abby.

147
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,100
I need you tfocus here,okay? 
Pitch in?

148
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,300
-I'll talk to her when I can.
-Why you?

149
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,000
Because dealing with an angry woman
requires a great deal of sensitivity.

150
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,100
Clearly not an area of expertise for you.

151
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,000
Well,I don't doub that 
you have more experience with angry women

152
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,700
Now,you see,
that wasn't very sensitive,was it?

153
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,700
The man has one serious relationship
and all of a sudden hes an expert.

154
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,800
All right,there is one clear-cut undeniable reason
why I should be the one to talk to abby.

155
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,000
She owes me a dollar. Now...

156
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,500
uh,we ran down I.D.'S 
on the remains,got a hit on the woman.

157
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,800
Hmm,classic dinozzo.

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
One intact fingerprint off 
her left hand matches driver's license.

159
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,600
Marilyn torrance,age 58 of tyson's corner.

160
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,800
There's no case file

161
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,200
because her nephew 
and his wife never reported her missing

162
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,900
They're on their way in.

163
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,400
That it?

164
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,000
mcgee?

165
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,700
Be right there,ducky.

166
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,600
Saved by the bell.

167
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,200
They were dismembered

168
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,700
by severing tendons,muscles 
from ligaments at every joint.

169
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,400
The neck,shoulder,elbow,
wrist,hip,knee,ankle,

170
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,400
et cetera.

171
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,300
There's very little damage 
to the bones themselves,

172
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,700
except the rib cages,they were cut.

173
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,200
-Probably using a bone saw.
-Were they murdered?

174
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,900
One of them at least was.

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,700
Blunt-force trauma to the female skull.

176
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,200
A blow to the back of the head

177
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,600
that was certainly enough 
to kill a woman of her age.

178
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,700
Fourth-rib-phase analysis suggests 
that she was in her 70s

179
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,400
According to the dmv,marilyn torranceas 58.

180
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,400
-Women lie about their age.
-But this is her hand.

181
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,400
-Not her head.
-Well,maybe that's her head.

182
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,800
That's a man's skull.

183
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,400
Well,maybe u reassembled the pieces incorrectly.

184
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,700
The problem is we can't reassemble the pieces.

185
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,300
We don't have two full sets of remns.

186
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
We're missing pieces.

187
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,600
Yes,and these unrelated pieces,

188
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,100
well,they belong to 
at least three differt people.

189
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,600
Three more bodies?

190
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,300
We're missing a lot of pieces.

191
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,000
This is more than someone
 just dumping two bodies.

192
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,100
I think you're looking for a mass murderer.

193
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,000
What do you got,abs?

194
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,600
Deying flesh,organs and human tissue.

195
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,300
-The DNA confirms that...
-five different people.

196
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,500
Well,if you alrea talked to ducky,
there's not much I can tell you.

197
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,700
You didn't give me much to work with,gibbs.

198
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,700
There's barely any blood.
The bodies were probably drained.

199
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,700
So what,you think we're looking for a vampire?

200
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,900
there are traces of llulose,fiber,
common paper and string.

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,100
The parts were wrapped.

202
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,400
Yeah,but they're too degraded 
to get any fingerprints off of.

203
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,200
There was one thing.

204
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,700
The screws from the marble frontispiece.

205
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,500
They've been collecting rust 
since the interment in 1978.

206
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,800
But look at the heads.They're scratched.

207
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,700
That's from the screwdriver--
it dislodged the rust.

208
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,700
But look at the other crypts.

209
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,600
See the screws?

210
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,500
-Yeah.They're all rusted.
-Except for these two crypts.

211
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,700
Anson gage,usmc,colonel;
raymond dalton,U.S.Army.

212
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,400
Might be vandalism,
but it might be something.

213
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,200
Dinozzo.

214
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,900
Contact next of kin 
and get permission to open those two crypts

215
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,700
On it,boss!

216
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,900
-Nice catch,abby.-Yeah.

217
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,100
I couldn't help but notice 
how quiet it is in here.

218
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,100
-Where's the music?
-I just wasn't in the mood.

219
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,700
Anything... you want to talk about?

220
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,000
Why would there be?

221
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah,I don't know,it's just that mcgee said
that you weren't really acting like yourself,

222
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,800
-and so I thought...
-so you guys have been talking about me?

223
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,900
Yeah. No.

224
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
We're wondering 
if there was anything bothering you.

225
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,900
You want to know what bothers Me?

226
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,400
It bothers me

227
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,400
when people gossip about other people 
behind their backs.

228
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Do you really think that that is okay?

229
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,100
Yeah. 'Cause...

230
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,300
I mean,it's the only way to gossip.

231
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,100
'Cause if we talked about you in front your face,

232
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,500
then that would just be talking about you.

233
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,900
You know what,we're just not gonna...
we're not gonna do that anymore.

234
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,000
Sorry.

235
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,700
-Your aunt lived with you?
-When she was in town,yes.

236
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,100
You're sure she was murdered?

237
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,200
Preliminary findings have been inconclusive,
mr.Torrance,but it's probable.

238
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,100
-When was the last time you saw her?
-It's been almost three months now.

239
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,900
And you never filed a missing persons report?

240
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,600
Well,she does this.

241
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,400
She would meet a new man with a yacht

242
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,500
or a jet...and disappear for a while.

243
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,800
We always expected 
she would resurface eventually.

244
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,800
Just never like this.

245
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
here.

246
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,100
I know how difficult it is 
to lose a person you care about.

247
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,900
Thank you.

248
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,300
we'll also need a list of anyone 
who has access to your home.

249
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,300
Contractors,workmen,employees.

250
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,600
And also the names of any of 
her travel companions or associates

251
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,500
Of course.

252
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,900
Thank you for coming in so quickly.

253
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,900
-If you learn anything...
-please call.

254
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,600
As soon as we know more.

255
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,500
They were really cut up.

256
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,900
Sorry.It's a poor choice ofords.

257
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,000
How many more of these are we going to do?

258
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,300
Uh,at least fiv so pace yourself.

259
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,100
What do you mean by that,mcgee?

260
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,600
Nothing. Just,you know,
you got a little emotional in there.

261
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,000
I will meet you upairs,miss dalton,okay?

262
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,600
Okay.

263
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,000
Next of kin?

264
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,200
Abbyhinks there might be more body parts 
hidden in her grandfather's crypt.

265
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,600
-You talked tabby?
-Yeah,mcgee.

266
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,800
I was right,wasn't I?
There's something wrong.

267
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,700
-Let it go,probie.
-Why?

268
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,600
Because I'm pretty sure it's something you did.

269
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,800
Well,what did I do?

270
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,400
Well,think about it probie.

271
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm sure you'll come up with something.

272
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,400
I don't understand at 
I'm supposed to be looking at.

273
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,000
These photos are of your grandfather's tomb.

274
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,800
I get that.

275
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,500
I assure you this has nothing 
to do with your grandfather.

276
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,700
How could it?

277
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,300
He's been dead 13 years.

278
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,600
I was at the funeral.

279
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Right.

280
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,500
It's been tampered with,okay?
And we believe that,uh,

281
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,200
there's evidence hidden inside relating 
to an ongoing murder investigation.

282
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,800
What kind of evidence?

283
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,700
I run my own business,agent dinozzo.

284
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,800
At means I'm losing money every minute 
that I have to spend here.

285
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,000
So why don't you just tell me 
what it is that you want from me?

286
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,900
we need you to give us permission to open it.

287
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,600
So if you could just sign...

288
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,200
these authorization forms.

289
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,200
My dad put me to work right after my grandpa died.

290
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,300
You know the first lesson that I learned?

291
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,900
What's that?

292
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,200
Don't sign any papers 
without having a lawyer look at'em.

293
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,800
That's a good lesson.

294
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,800
But if it's cessary,

295
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,000
we'll get a federal warrant.

296
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,200
Oh,at would be much easier for me.

297
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,700
-You should just do that.
-Okay.

298
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,700
Anything else you need?

299
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,800
-Just a federal warnt.
-Great.

300
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,800
Company,boss.

301
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Special agent gibbs.

302
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,100
Colonel ma.

303
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,200
I got a call your case might 
be venturing into cid territory.

304
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,200
That call was premature.

305
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,500
Really?

306
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,600
Here I thought was four weeks overdue.

307
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:04,100
I understand you were denied permission
by the family to access colonel dalton's crypt

308
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,900
Got a warrant.

309
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,600
And that got my attention.

310
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,300
Why don't you fill me in.

311
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,800
Wouldn't want to 
make a bad situation worse,would you?

312
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,600
Don't look so nervous,jethro.

313
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,200
-Do I look nervous?
-No.

314
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,100
You actually look,
um...you look pretty good.

315
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,000
David,dinozzo,perimeter.

316
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,900
Sure you don't want us 
to help you in there,boss?

317
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,500
'Course not,
'cause if you did,you would've said,

318
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,600
"david,dinozzo,follow me."
Probie,stop it.

319
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,400
We're not going anywhere.

320
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,100
Why? What'd I miss?

321
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,400
Not like you to leave something unfinished.

322
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,000
The crime scene.

323
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,300
-Ever worry you're slipping?
-Nop.

324
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,500
-Any suspects yet?
-Nothing concrete.

325
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,900
-What does your gut say?
-Theory is it's an inside job.

326
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,100
But you don't like that.

327
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,500
So how else would he know 
which crypts are vacant?

328
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Ah,read the faceplates.

329
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,700
So the warrant didn't exactly specify 
what we're looking for here.

330
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Well,it's best to not have expectations.

331
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,100
It staves off disappointment.

332
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,500
What are we hoping for?

333
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,100
You throw that 
"we" word around pretty casually.

334
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,900
The last time someone 
tried to remove one of these,

335
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,000
-it blew up in his face.
-Ah.

336
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,500
You might want to step back a little bit.

337
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,200
Thank you for your concern.

338
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,000
I see what you mean.

339
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,200
Expectations

340
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,700
Gibbs did t look happy to see her.

341
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,800
His body language suggested 
he was not comfortable at all.

342
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,100
Eh,nothing makes gibbs uncomfortable.

343
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,900
Nothing job-related.

344
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,400
You think he ended it with her?

345
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,100
Asming that he started something.

346
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,000
-I don't buy it.
-Why not?

347
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,500
-For one,she's not a redhead.
-People do change,tony.

348
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,400
It's true--
even you have a girlfriend.

349
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,000
I haven't changed.

350
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,100
Really?What about the pretty girl in the office.

351
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,100
-Natalie dalton?
-Well,you noticed she was pretty,

352
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,200
but you didn't flirt with her.

353
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,600
-That would've been unprofessional.
-I don't know.

354
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,700
Might have gotten her to sign the authorization.

355
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,700
Then we would not have needed the warrant.

356
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
Then colonel mann wouldn't have been here.

357
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,700
And we would be inside doing our job.
Like professionals.

358
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,600
All because you don't flirt anymore.
Why  that?

359
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,000
Enough gossip,mcgee.

360
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,700
Tony,you like to 
talk about everyone's private lives.

361
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,300
Talk,yes.

362
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,800
But I don't write entire books about em,do I?

363
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,600
Does create a bit of a trust...
issue,mcgee.

364
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,700
Excuse me. Hi.

365
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,600
Am I able to go inside today?

366
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,900
E mausoleum is closed,sir.

367
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,700
Here it is.

368
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,300
Are you gonna let me in?

369
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,100
I think we should be clear 
on the implications first.

370
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,000
You're interfering with my investigation.

371
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,500
-Is that what I'm doing
-Honestly,I'm not sure.

372
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,000
If there's evidence in here,

373
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm gonna be obligated 
to see this through to the end.

374
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,000
And if there's not?

375
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,300
Then I don't see why my involvement 
shouldn't end right here.

376
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,700
if you wanted to see me,
you didn't have to manufacture a reason

377
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,200
I follow the orders of the united states army,

378
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,500
even when they don't exactly make sense.

379
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,700
-You could've called.
-So could you.

380
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,800
I distinctly remember the last thing you said 
as you were slinking out of my bedroom...

381
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,700
-I don't slink.
-"I'll call you."

382
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,800
For the rerd,

383
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,200
I didn't think the last time we saw each other
was gonna be the last time we saw each other

384
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,700
-Neither did I.
-Well,here we are.

385
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,600
-Lucky for us.
-Call it fate.

386
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,100
You're just gonna let fate decide 
whether we go our separate ways?

387
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,000
Five bodies in total.

388
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,300
We've only recovered portions.

389
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,600
-You're hoping the rest are in here.
-Aren't you?

390
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,100
Honestly,I'm not really sure.

391
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,600
That the answer you're looking for?

392
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,400
If the bodies recovered 
from the mausoleum were,

393
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,100
in fact,the result of mass murder,

394
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,600
one might expect a certain modicum 
of consistency in the manner of death

395
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,700
-One might.
-Yes.And one would be wrong.

396
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,800
Shot,stabbed,strangled,bludgeoned,

397
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and poor miss undermined torrance.

398
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,200
Three women,two men,

399
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,800
ages ranging from 19 to 70.

400
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,800
Three are caucasian,one asian,and one black.

401
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,100
-No common traits.
-Not in life.

402
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,900
But the blood,however,settled on 
different surfaces on each of the bodies

403
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,200
Her left thigh and back,his chest and buttocks,

404
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,100
-meaning....
-the bodies were moved repeatedly

405
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,100
Precisely.They were killed 
and then moved for some sort of preparation

406
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,900
You can see the indentations on the ankles

407
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,900
here and here,here.

408
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,300
Chain-link.

409
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:37,200
Yes.I believe the bodies were suspended
and drained prior to being,well,

410
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,600
-there's only one word for it.
-Butchered.

411
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,700
We sent the tissue samples to abby.
Hopefully,she can...

412
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,500
speak of the devil.

413
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,800
What we have here is paradoxical behavi.

414
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:52,200
-On one side,we have...
-an emotional,unrestrained murderer

415
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
using whatever means at hand.

416
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,800
Yes.And,on the other,
someone tidy,meticulous,

417
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:02,100
and almost flawless 
in the way he dissected these bodies.

418
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,700
That wasn't abby.That was the director.

419
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,100
She wants to see you.

420
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,200
Both of you.

421
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,100
As far as we can tell,

422
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,000
the only thing that 
brought these people together

423
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,500
is how they were taken apart.

424
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,300
In addition to marilyn torrance,

425
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,400
we have a 19-year-old runaway 
from florida. He was shot.

426
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,800
30-year-old prostitute.

427
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,200
She was strangled.

428
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,100
No next of kin on either of them.

429
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,900
Wade carlin,26-year-old georgetown
graduate from michigan.

430
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,600
He broke off contact with his parents
after his girliend dumped him six months ago

431
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,700
They thought he was ck 
kerouac-ing around the country.

432
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,500
When,in fact,he was stabbed
to death a few weeks after the breakup

433
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,200
All miing persons cases.

434
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,000
-All have led to nowhere.
-Until now.

435
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Gloria grady,age 72.

436
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,900
Ducky says she was the first victim.
Blunt trauma.

437
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Only one relative-- 
her son,len grady.

438
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,200
-He was at james river.
-With a bouquet of flowers.

439
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,800
Lilies. For who?

440
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,300
No record of any gdy at james river.

441
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,500
-Could be under a different name.
-Could be a friend.

442
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,000
But lilies. They're feminine.

443
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,800
-The kind you give to a woman.
-Like your mother.

444
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Grady's mother.
I don't know your mother.

445
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,700
Coulbe visiting his trophies.

446
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,700
Fits the classic profile:
30s,single,white.

447
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,700
We should tell gibbs.

448
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,300
Yeah? Why don't we wait till he gets out?

449
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,700
Unless you want to be the one
 to interrupt his meeting.

450
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,900
Campfire's over.

451
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,400
Okay.Well,thank you,colonel.

452
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,900
I will get her back to you as soon as possible.

453
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,700
Your supiors have agreed 
to loan us your services for the interim

454
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,000
I trust that there's not a problem with that?

455
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,400
No.Of course not,director.

456
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,500
As long as special agent gibbs continues
to be forthcoming with pertinent information

457
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,400
Agent gibbs?

458
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,700
As long as she follows my lead,
I cat foresee a problem.

459
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,100
You two have worked cases 
together successfully in the past.

460
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,500
Nothing's changed to interfere with that 
professional relationship,has there?

461
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,800
-What do we have so far?
-Four confirmed homicides.

462
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,500
-Likely,five.
-That's all you know?

463
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,500
I know we're wting time 
debating jurisdictional protocol

464
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,400
and discussing who's entitled to what.

465
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,200
-Well,then,why don't you get back to it?
-Yeah. Thank you.

466
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,800
Um... not you,colonel mann.

467
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,500
I'd like to have a private word with you.

468
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,300
-Um... breaking in a new pair?
-No.

469
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,800
I always wear these.Why do I alwaywear these?

470
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,500
-Let me see your shoes.
-Okay.

471
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,400
Flat,sensible,functional.

472
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,900
-Not very sexy,but....
-but they do the trick.

473
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,300
What do I nt three-inch platforms?
I'm already five-ten.

474
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:02,000
-I love these shoes...just all wrong.
-Wrong for who?

475
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,300
-The tissue samples.
-I don't follow.

476
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,800
You don't want to hear about shoes.

477
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,800
-You want to hear about tissue samples.
-Sure.

478
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,700
I ran the torrance tissues through the mass spec,

479
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,000
and I found abnormal levels of chlorine.

480
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
-Chlorine?
-Yeah.Like in a swimming pool.

481
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,700
Len grady's website.

482
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,700
He's a jack-of-all-trades.
Basically,a guy with a big van.

483
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,200
And a little initiave.
Something of an amateur entrepreneur.

484
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,800
That's not easy to say.

485
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,100
Rpenter,plumber,

486
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,900
gardener,electrician,tv installations,

487
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,400
-snow shoveling....
-but,most importantly,pool cleaning.

488
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,900
That supposeto mean something?

489
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,400
Well,he's not just any pool man.
He's th torrances' pool man.

490
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,800
Grady's got his own key.

491
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,700
Heated.Indoor Regular monthly maintenance.
I looked into it.

492
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,900
Royalty checks burning a hole 
in your pocket,mcgee?

493
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,700
Already tied grady to his mother.

494
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,700
-Body number one.
-And now torrance.

495
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,100
-Body number two.
-Let's bring him in.

496
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,800
A lot of people were 
pleased see sharif off the streets.

497
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,600
My superiors acknowledged 
your letter of commendation.

498
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,200
I want you to know I appreciate it.

499
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,700
-The two make an effective team.
-Gibbs and myself?

500
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,200
it wasn't just a flash in the pan,was it?

501
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,300
Your service at CID is up in six months.

502
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,200
You must have starte 
considering life after the military.

503
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,900
Yes.It has crossed my mind.

504
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,800
The question is how to best serve your future.

505
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,600
Where the opportunity for advancement lies.

506
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,200
It's not too early for a cocktail,is it?

507
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,000
The sun must be wn somewhere.

508
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,300
-You drink bourbon?
-No.Not regularly.

509
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,400
Spend enough time around gibbs,and you'll learn.

510
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,400
Believe me.

511
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,100
It's an acquired taste.

512
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,500
And when did you first acquire it?

513
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,500
It's been a while.

514
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,300
But it's something that stays with you though.

515
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,900
Nobody's home,boss.

516
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,200
Neighbor said he went out about an hour ago.

517
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,500
What do we do?

518
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,000
We wait.

519
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,900
Okay.

520
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,200
Colonel mann still in with the director?

521
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,700
What do you think they're talking about?

522
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,600
We wait...

523
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,000
silently.

524
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,800
I got him.

525
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,900
Len grady?

526
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,500
Freeze!

527
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,500
Federal agents.

528
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,900
Up,up,up!

529
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,800
What? What?

530
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,800
Bachelor living.

531
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,200
Not every bachelor.

532
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,200
This guy's got a card for everything.

533
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,800
"Len grady,painter."

534
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,000
"Len grady,fountain design."

535
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,600
"Cottage cheese ceilgs removed 
and made smooth."

536
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,500
Anything with a blade on it,

537
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,800
we should get to abby.

538
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,400
Not really what she wants.

539
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,900
She's upset about her shoes.

540
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,400
Doesn't sound like abby.

541
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,800
Wrong pair of shoes 
can reduce a woman to tears.

542
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,300
-She was crying?
-PracticaY.

543
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,200
It's not the shoes.

544
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,600
-Got something. 
-Yep.

545
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,600
White paper ckage tied with brown string.

546
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,500
What's that?

547
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,200
It's a pork chop.

548
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,400
-Hear you got our guy in there.
-Maybe.

549
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,000
-What?
-Nothing.

550
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,600
It seems like you were thinking something.

551
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,800
That's been known to happen.

552
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,400
Something about me.

553
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,200
Thought I recognized your perfume.

554
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,700
I don't wear perfume.

555
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,700
Must have been something else.

556
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,400
So...can I just go ahead 
and pay the fi and get out of here?

557
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,400
Fine?

558
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,900
I know I shouldn't have cashed 
my mother's social security checks

559
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,300
We're not the irs.

560
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,700
-She went missing last march.
-She had dementia.

561
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,800
It was getting worse.
She must have gott out one day.

562
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,000
We're talking about a person here,ot a dog.

563
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,300
I keep hoping she'll come back.

564
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,700
You already know where to find her.

565
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,300
How do I know that?

566
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,200
-You went tvisit her.
-Brought her flowers.

567
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,400
My mother's at the cemetery?

568
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,600
What's left of her.She was dismembered.

569
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,500
Look at his mind spinning.

570
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,900
He's trying to figure out how to play it.

571
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,200
I didn't do that.

572
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,600
I took care of my mother.

573
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,700
I fed her.

574
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,300
I cleaned up after her.

575
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,700
You must have been praying for it to end.

576
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,600
I loved my mother!

577
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,900
Maybe you were right the first time.

578
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,900
It must have been like putting down a dog.

579
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,900
Only no one everoticed.

580
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,400
Getting away with it
 must have been the real shking part.

581
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,700
And a new career is born.

582
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,600
You did it again...and again.

583
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,200
-Something's not right.
-What do you mean?

584
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,600
He looks relieved.

585
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,300
Gloria grady.

586
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,600
Okay. Stop.

587
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,800
You have something you want to tell us?

588
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,600
All these people were chopped up?

589
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That's disgusting.

590
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,100
What kind of person do you think could do that?

591
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,400
I mean,you're looking for a monster.

592
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,700
What do you want me to say?

593
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,900
It's not me.

594
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,700
What now?

595
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,700
Want me to do a lie-detector test 
or something?

596
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,000
You just did.

597
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,700
He's telling the truth.

598
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,100
-You think I'm wrong?
-No.

599
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,700
But he was lieved when you 
connected her with the rest of the bodies.

600
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,900
He has no feelings about them at all.

601
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,300
-Doesn't mean he wasn't involved.
-Maybe.

602
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,600
But that doesn't look like a man 
who feels trapped.

603
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,600
That looks like a man 
who knows he has a way out.

604
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,200
There's something much worse 
than len grady out there.

605
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,000
Only he knows what it is.

606
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,400
We've got to push grady 
harder to tell us what he knows.

607
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,400
He won'T.

608
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,000
-You think he's protecting the real kler?
-He's protecting himself.

609
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,300
I can prov that he's not acting alone.

610
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,000
Trying to run down grady's van.
No luck so far.

611
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,800
He was on foot when you apprehended him.

612
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
So what did he do with his ride?

613
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,400
And whenid he do it?

614
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,000
After he spotted us athe cemetery.

615
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,900
What,he just happened to be visiting?

616
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,400
There's no such thing as a coincidence.

617
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,300
Well,he wanted information.

618
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,300
He was there to watch us.

619
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,700
But he got there as quickly as I did,

620
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,100
so how did he know about the investigation?

621
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,400
He's got a friend on the inside.

622
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,400
Uh-huh.One person's a psychopath,
two people's a conspiracy.

623
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,100
So who was he talking to?

624
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,100
Grady doesn't leave here 
until we know everything about him.

625
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,900
You start with yesterday 
and you work backwards.

626
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,600
Go.

627
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Forensics?

628
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,100
-Boss...
-yeah.

629
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,200
Um,if you're going to go see abby,

630
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,900
I think you should know 
she's going through something...

631
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,700
-I'm not going empty
-handed,mcgee.

632
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,400
Gibbs.

633
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,200
And lieutenant colonel mann.

634
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,000
Abby.
Can I interest you in some knives?

635
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,700
I've got kitchen knives,

636
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,900
pen knives,pocket knives,swiss army knives,

637
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,700
razor blades,x-acto blades,

638
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,300
issors,saws,scalpels,

639
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,100
hedge clippers,an adze,an awl,

640
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,600
a fish scaler and even a golf-hole cutter.

641
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,000
All recovered from grady's pigsty?

642
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,900
Reflected in the care 
he used to maintain his cutlery,

643
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,700
there's dings and nicks and dull edges.

644
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,700
None of these correspond to any of the precise 
incisions used to dismember the corpses

645
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,900
For such a slob,he certainly 
is careful when it counts.

646
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,600
There wasn't a single trace of human blood anywhE.

647
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,000
Human bloo..

648
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,200
your boy grady is something of a carnivore.

649
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,100
From the remnants on his silverware,

650
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,400
I could pretty much tell you 
every meal he had for a week.

651
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,200
Liverwurst,knockwurst,

652
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,500
pastrami,roast beef,rack of lamb.

653
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,300
Which leads us to...this.

654
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,400
The po chop from his freezer.

655
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,500
Probably his next meal.

656
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,900
When I pull it up,it gets really interesting.

657
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,600
It matches the incisions on the bodies.

658
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,000
Tool mk analysis isn't as precise as
 say fingerprints or ballistics,

659
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,600
but I can conclusively tell you that none of 
the blades in grady's possession carved that pig

660
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,300
Well,why would they?

661
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,500
He probably hait carved.

662
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,100
His partner's a butcher.

663
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,600
Don't you have work to do?

664
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:38,200
Look,it's not something that you can 
fix in the classic gibbs hit-and-run style,okay?

665
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,700
I got time,abs.

666
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:50,800
It's stupid.It's just...a guy.

667
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,300
I'm t going to start spilling my guts 
just because you keep standing here.

668
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,400
All right,apparently I am too much for him.

669
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,600
Can you imagine that? Me?

670
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,500
And it's not what you think.

671
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,500
It's not all this.He likes...

672
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,100
he likes small women.

673
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,800
I got dumped 'cause I'm too... too big.

674
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,400
And don't even bother with the,

675
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,600
"no,it's him. He's too small."

676
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Or"if he can't accept you for 
who you are then it's his problem," thing.

677
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,600
He just doesn't think that we could make it work

678
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:34,800
and I've done everything ian to 
try to convince him that he's wrong.

679
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,900
So I guess I'm just going to have to accept it.

680
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,900
i'm let it go.

681
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:56,600
Thanks,gibbs.You always know what to say.

682
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,800
Metro P.D. Responded to the bolo on grady's van.

683
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,200
So far 13 possibles and counting.

684
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,500
Mcgee.

685
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,200
Supermarkets,slaughter houses,

686
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,600
any place with a butcher on site 
within a 20-block radius of grady's residence.

687
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,600
Narrow the search to boutique shops.

688
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,200
They'd need their privacy.

689
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,900
-There's just one.
-Just one?

690
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,800
Boutique butcher's a dying industry.

691
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,000
-Where?
-Le cochon,mass avenue.

692
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,100
All right,get a list of employees,
owners past and present.

693
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,600
Let's roll.

694
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,700
Ms. Dalton.

695
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,400
I thought you said you didn't need me.

696
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,400
What's your relationship with len grady?

697
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Len,he's my boyiend.Why?
What's going on?

698
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,100
You told grady you spo with us earlier?

699
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,700
Yeah,I mentioned it.

700
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,700
Is this about the investigation?

701
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,400
Where is len?

702
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,200
In custody.

703
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,100
We suspect he's committed at least five murders.

704
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,000
That's impossible.Len would never hurt any...

705
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,300
-five?
-At least.

706
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,800
Where's your freezer?

707
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,700
-Nothing in here,boss.
-Just pork,beef and lamb.

708
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,200
-What else would there be?
-Human blood.

709
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,300
Human?

710
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,500
What's in here?

711
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,400
It's a freezer I use for overflow to store geese
and turkeys in the holidays.

712
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,500
Got a key?

713
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,100
What kind of evidence did you say that 
you found in my grandfather's crypt?

714
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,900
Does gradyas access to your store?

715
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,200
He's here all the time.

716
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,700
Look,this can't be happenin okay?
There must be some kind of...

717
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,000
he was a regular customer.
Every week like clockwork.

718
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,400
It was the only time that
he could get away from his mother.

719
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,300
He felt trapped.

720
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,400
I could tell that he needed 
to get on with his life.

721
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,600
It started with a few words here and tre

722
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:40,300
-And then...fore long we were...
-together.

723
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,400
Not fully,no.We didn't trade keys until...

724
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,800
after she,uh,disappeared.

725
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,900
He learned your trade.

726
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,300
I taught him.

727
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,500
He always wanted to try new things.

728
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,100
I never suspected that...

729
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,900
how could I not have seen it?

730
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,800
-Love makes you blind.
-No.

731
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,200
I must be some kind of monster.

732
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,200
Is she the monster you were talking about?

733
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:30,700
-No,she loves me.
-How?

734
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,000
We're in love.

735
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,200
Then she had to know about it.

736
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,800
She had to know the real you.

737
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,700
She didn't do anything.

738
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,400
You're right.She could have stopped you.

739
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,800
She should have stopped you.

740
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,600
If it was real.

741
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,700
She didn't know!I hid it.I hid everything.

742
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,000
Just leave her out of it.

743
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,000
Natalie!I'm sorry!

744
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,700
I'm sorry,natalie!I'm so sorry!

745
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,600
I love you!I love you so much!

746
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,200
I'm sorry!

747
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,100
Let's try this ain.
Marilyn torrance.

748
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,300
She was swimming in her pool.
I drowned her.

749
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,600
Wade carlin.

750
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,400
Natalie was at the wholesale market.

751
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,400
He came in for a sandwich.
I stabbed M.

752
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,500
She was a hooker.

753
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,100
I was lonely.
Natalie was out of town.

754
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,000
I strangled her.
And the kid was nobody.

755
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,500
Nobody. I just shot him.

756
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,500
You kept them in the freezer for over a year.

757
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,700
Why'd you move the bodies?

758
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,700
Why did you move them?

759
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,400
He needed the space.

760
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
No one could stop me.

761
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,600
You were gonna kill again.

762
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,200
He already did.

763
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,700
What did you do with the body?

764
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,700
Doesn't matter.

765
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,300
Doesn't matter.

766
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,700
No,no... no. No!

767
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,900
No! Natalie!

768
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,800
find the van.Find the body.

769
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,100
Let her go.

770
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,700
-Still at work?
-Yeah

771
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,900
I was just catching up on some things.
Cheek swabs.

772
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:18,500
Hey,your music's back on.
You're feeling good again.

773
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,600
Maybe not good.Not yet.

774
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,800
But better.

775
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,200
You know how sometes a guy 
can get you all tied up inside.

776
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,300
Yes.

777
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,700
-And then you can't get the knots out?
-Yes.

778
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,600
Well,it just really helped me 
to talk things out with gibbs.

779
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,200
You know,unknot the knots.

780
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,500
'Cause even if you don't let it show,
people can still tell.

781
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,300
So,you know,if you ever want to 
talk about lieutenant sanders...

782
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,400
I liked him.He died.

783
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,800
And what else is there to say?

784
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,400
Well,I am glad you feel better.

785
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,100
With the right partner,
you can make the perfect monster,huh?

786
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,600
Give me a little old-time romance.

787
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,000
someone's got hidden skeletons of his own.

788
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,900
If I ever find myself in a dire situation,

789
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,900
the proverbial body I need to get rid of...

790
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,200
I think I would tell you.

791
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,100
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

792
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,200
What makes youhink I wouldn't turn you in?

793
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,700
