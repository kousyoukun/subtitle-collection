1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,300
In pain, we may find comfort,
in sorrow, hope,

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,400
in death, resurrection.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,100
Fire!

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Aim... fire!

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,300
Aim... fire!

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,300
They're almost finished out
there, Ken.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,300
What do you want me
to tell you, Jack?

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,800
I can't get the damn thing open.
What? Stripped?

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,000
Nah, it's catching.

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,400
It's just stuck or something.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,400
When was the last time
you opened one of these things?

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,400
First one we've had
since I've been
with the VA.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,200
That's, like, what,
a decade?

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,700
Yeah. Let me try.

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,800
Okay, it's moving.

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,100
What's that smell?

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
You okay?

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:21,800
 <font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

19
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:31,801
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@MAOREN
Sync:FRM@∫„–«</font>

20
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,400
Give me a dollar!

21
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,600
Okay. What's wrong
with that one?

22
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,200
The machine wouldn't take it
and I want a candy bar.

23
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,700
What's wrong
with that candy bar?

24
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,100
It has nougat
in it.

25
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,400
But you hate nougat.

26
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,500
I know!

27
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,300
It was a mistake, McGee!

28
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,900
Do you have a dollar?!

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,900
All I have are big bills.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,900
What is nougat?

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,700
It's whipped dolphin fat.

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,000
No, that's the filling
in Klowny Kake.

33
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,700
That is a myth!

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,500
Would someone please give me
a dollar?!

35
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,900
Sure, I got one.

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,300
Thanks.

37
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,200
God, it's like some kind
of crime

38
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,400
to not like nougat.

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,100
I don't even know
what nougat is.

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,500
It's a cream made from sugar,
honey and nuts.

41
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,000
Grab your gear.

42
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,100
Got an explosion at a Marine's
funeral in James River National.

43
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,400
Did anyone else see what
just happened there with Abby?

44
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,500
Yeah, she stole my dollar.

45
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,700
Last ones to the party.

46
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,500
It's not really a party
until the bomb squad says it is.

47
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,500
What'd you find?

48
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,600
We got nothing.

49
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,600
No ordnance,

50
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,500
no residue,
no electronics,

51
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,500
no time device,

52
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,800
no wiring,
no remote.

53
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,600
No evidence of a bomb.

54
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,000
Except for
the explosion.

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,800
We got two employees injured,
both vets.

56
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,900
They were taken
to the VA

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,800
with concussions
and shrapnel wounds.

58
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,600
Got names?

59
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,700
Former Lance Corporal
Lloyd Jackson,

60
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,700
36, and PFC Kenneth Dixon, 25.

61
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,000
Veterans keep getting younger.

62
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,300
The kid they were burying
was only 22.

63
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
It's a family crypt.

64
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,100
Tandem? His grandfather
was in the back slot.

65
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,100
Still there as far
as we could tell.

66
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,100
Your men cleared?

67
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,000
Fire readings are clean.

68
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,100
Air's safe to breathe,
not that I would recommend it.

69
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,100
Anything else?

70
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,600
Yeah. You might want
to cover your shoes.

71
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,900
That is truly appalling.

72
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,700
"Chief Warrant Officer
Mitchell Waller."

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,900
Died, 1978. Should be the one
in the back of the crypt.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,800
He appears to be undisturbed.

75
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,000
He would be the only one.

76
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,700
This is really the most
disgusting thing I've ever seen.

77
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,800
And believe me,
that says a lot.

78
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,000
It's like porridge.

79
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,200
The word is
"effluvium;"

80
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,200
the result of decomposing
human organs and tissue.

81
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,100
This is people?

82
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,500
Yes, two, I'd say,

83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,100
judging bye the volume.

84
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,600
And the two skulls,
of course.

85
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,300
Mr. Palmer,
we have to recover
all of this.

86
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,300
One Wet Vac for the Soylent
Green coming right up.

87
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,400
Uh, somewhat claustrophobic.

88
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,500
And for all eternity.

89
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,300
Our friends here
might agree with you.

90
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,500
They obviously needed
to get out.

91
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,100
They didn't belong
there in the first place.

92
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,300
Vents are definitely clogged.

93
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,900
Careful, Doctor,
we still haven't

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,700
found traces
of what caused
the explosion.

95
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,900
If my suspicions are correct,
Officer David,

96
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,300
the bomb is all around us.

97
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,600
It's a phenomenon
in the death industry

98
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,300
informally referred to as
"exploding casket syndrome."

99
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,100
Well, the floor's all yours,
Duck.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,100
 Thank you, Jethro.

101
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,000
All bodies contain enzymes
and bacteria.

102
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,900
Immediately upon death,
they start to break down tissue.

103
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,400
Yes, a body can liquefy
within a week,

104
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
especially if it hasn't been
embalmed.

105
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,600
It's possible that these remains
were human in appearance

106
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,600
as recently as two weeks ago.

107
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,200
And someone dumped
them in here.

108
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Yes, and in such
a confined space,

109
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,700
as the gases were
given off the bodies,

110
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,900
without any proper ventilation--

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,900
the crypt itself
could become a pressure cooker.

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,500
The bodies were the bomb.

113
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,900
Not our first meat puzzle,
Doctor.

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,900
And it certainly
won't be the last.

115
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,600
Never forget, Mr. Palmer,

116
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,500
experience
is the ultimate teacher.

117
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,500
Corner pieces
are not as reliable

118
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,000
as the singular components.

119
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,100
Yes, as experience
has taught us.

120
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,700
Skulls and torsos.

121
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,300
And judging by these
pelvic structures,

122
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,700
we have a man
and a woman.

123
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,100
Yes, well, let's
put Adam

124
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,000
on the left and Eve
on the right.

125
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,800
This reminds me
of a summer

126
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,500
when I assisted at an
archaeological dig

127
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,900
in North Africa.

128
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,200
Our team unearthed

129
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,300
two fossilized Neanderthals
from a primitive burial mound:

130
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,500
one man, one woman.

131
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,400
This rib structure's
fractured, Doctor.

132
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,600
Possibly from the force
of the explosion?

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,800
Oh, no, no, no.

134
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,300
It's a clean,
serrated edge.

135
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Very unlikely.

136
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,600
Did you know that
the Zulus burn

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,500
all the possessions
of a dear departed

138
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,000
to ward off evil?

139
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,700
Some tribes even
throw spears

140
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,700
and shoot arrows into the air
to kill hovering spirits.

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,100
Right ulna.

142
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,300
That evolved
into the modern
military tradition

143
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,000
of firing a volley into the air.

144
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,600
Uh, right hand.

145
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,600
Yes, after the death
of an African king--

146
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,100
right hand--

147
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,400
some of his subjects used
to cut off fingers and toes.

148
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,700
It was considered
a mark of respect.

149
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
Humerus.

150
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,500
I suppose it depends 
on what you find funny.

151
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,800
Oh, right, humerus.

152
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,700
Right hand.

153
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,600
Didn't this happen
the last time?

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,100
 We're gonna need another table.

155
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,400
The mausoleum doesn't get
many visitors

156
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,000
which makes it
a creative place

157
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,400
to get rid of a few bodies,
but...

158
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,900
Whoever deposited them
would first have

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,600
to know that a portion

160
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,500
of Chief Waller's crypt
was vacant.

161
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,300
That would suggest
an inside job.

162
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,700
With the knowledge to access

163
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,100
a sealed tomb.

164
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Which would point 
to Jackson 
or Dixon.

165
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,000
If they hadn't practically
blown themselves up.

166
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,400
What do you think, McGee?

167
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,300
She definitely seemed un-Abby.

168
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,100
Who?
Abby.

169
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,400
Abby's unhappy?

170
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,800
No, Abby's un-Abby.

171
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,100
I need you to focus here,

172
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,600
okay? Pitch in?

173
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,500
I'll talk to her when I can.

174
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:09,499
Why you?

175
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,900
Because dealing with an angry
woman requires a great deal

176
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,100
of sensitivity.

177
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,300
Clearly

178
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,100
not an area
of expertise for you.

179
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:16,899
Well, I don't doubt

180
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,400
that you have more experience
with angry women.

181
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,500
Now, you see, that wasn't
very sensitive, was it?

182
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,400
The man has one serious
relationship

183
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,100
and all of a sudden
he's an expert.

184
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,500
All right, there is one
clear-cut undeniable reason

185
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,300
why I should be the one
to talk to Abby.

186
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,300
She owes me a dollar. Now...

187
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,300
Uh, we ran down I.D.'s
on the remains,

188
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,600
got a hit on the woman.

189
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,400
Hmm, classic DiNozzo.

190
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,600
One intact fingerprint

191
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,000
off her left hand
matches driver's license.

192
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,600
Marilyn Torrance, age 58
of Tyson's Corner.

193
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,000
There's no case file
because her nephew and his wife

194
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,300
never reported her missing.

195
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,300
They're on their way in.

196
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,000
That it?

197
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,900
McGee?

198
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,000
Be right there, Ducky.

199
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Saved by the bell.

200
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,200
They were dismembered

201
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,500
by severing tendons, muscles
from ligaments

202
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,900
at every joint.

203
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,900
The neck, shoulder,
elbow, wrist, hip,

204
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,100
knee, ankle,

205
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,200
et cetera.

206
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,400
There's very little
damage to the bones themselves,

207
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,400
except the rib cages,
they were cut.

208
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,900
Probably using a bone saw.

209
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,900
Were they murdered?

210
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,100
One of them at least was.

211
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,600
Blunt-force trauma
to the female skull.

212
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,200
A blow to the back of the head

213
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,400
that was certainly enough
to kill a woman of her age.

214
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
Fourth-rib-phase analysis
suggests

215
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,700
that she was in her 70s.

216
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,400
According to the DMV,
Marilyn Torrance was 58.

217
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,700
Women lie
about their age.

218
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,200
But this is her hand.

219
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,700
Not her head.

220
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,300
Well, maybe that's her head.

221
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,700
That's a man's skull.

222
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,100
Well, maybe you reassembled
the pieces incorrectly.

223
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,700
The problem is we can't
reassemble the pieces.

224
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,000
We don't have two

225
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,500
full sets
of remains.

226
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
We're missing pieces.

227
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,000
Yes, and these unrelated pieces,
well, they belong

228
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,300
to at least
three different people.

229
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,600
Three more bodies?

230
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,200
We're missing
a lot of pieces.

231
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,700
This is more than someone 
just dumping two bodies.

232
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,800
  ???

233
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,900
What do you got, Abs?

234
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Decaying flesh,
organs and human tissue.

235
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,000
The DNA confirms that...

236
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,000
Five different people.

237
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,200
Well, if you already
talked to Ducky,

238
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,500
there's not mu
I can tell you.

239
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,500
You didn't
give me much

240
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
to work with, Gibbs.

241
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,200
There's barely
any blood.

242
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,700
The bodies were
probably drained.

243
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:42,399
So what, you think

244
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,500
we're looking for a vampire?

245
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,200
There are traces of
cellulose, fiber,

246
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,000
common paper and string.

247
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,300
The parts were wrapped.

248
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,800
Yeah, but they're too
degraded to get any
fingerprints off of.

249
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,000
There was one thing.

250
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,600
The screws
from the marble frontispiece.

251
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,400
They've been collecting rust
since the interment in 1978.

252
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,700
But look at the heads.

253
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,900
They're scratched.

254
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,800
That's from the screwdriver--
it dislodged the rust.

255
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,500
But look at the other crypts.

256
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
See the screws?

257
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,300
Yeah. They're all rusted.

258
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,600
Except for these two crypts.

259
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,700
Anson Gage, USMC, Colonel;
Raymond Dalton, U.S. Army.

260
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,200
Might be vandalism, but
it might be something.

261
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,800
DiNozzo.
Contact next of kin

262
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,200
and get permission to open
those two crypts. On it, boss!

263
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,300
Nice catch, Abby.

264
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah.

265
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,000
I couldn't help but notice
how quiet it is in here.

266
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,000
Where's the music?
I just wasn't in the mood.

267
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,500
Anything... you want
to talk about?

268
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,300
Why would there be?

269
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,500
Yeah, I don't know,
it's just that McGee said

270
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,000
that you weren't really
acting like yourself,

271
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,600
and so I thought...
So you guys have been
talking about me?

272
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,600
Yeah. No.

273
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,200
We're wondering if there
was anything bothering you.

274
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,800
You want to know
what bothers me?

275
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,900
It bothers me when people
gossip about other people

276
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,300
behind their backs.

277
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,300
Do you really think
that that is okay?

278
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,500
Yeah. 'Cause...

279
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,300
I mean, it's
the only way to gossip.

280
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,800
'Cause if we talked
about you in front

281
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,700
of your face, then that
would just be talking about you.

282
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,400
You know what, we're
just not gonna... we're
not gonna do that anymore.

283
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,500
Sorry.

284
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,100
Your aunt lived with you?

285
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,800
When she was in town, yes.

286
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,700
You're sure she was murdered?

287
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,400
Preliminary findings have been
inconclusive, Mr. Torrance,

288
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,200
but it's probable.

289
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,800
When was the last time
you saw her?

290
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,000
It's been almost
three months now.

291
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,800
And you never filed
a missing persons report?

292
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,100
Well, she does this.

293
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,300
She would meet a new man
with a yacht or a jet...

294
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,600
and disappear for a while.

295
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,300
We always expected
she would resurface eventually.

296
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,400
Just never like this.

297
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,300
Um...

298
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,200
Here.

299
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,600
I know how difficult it is
to lose a person you care about.

300
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,400
Thank you.

301
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,900
Uh, we'll also need a list

302
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,300
of anyone who has
access to your home.

303
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,100
Contractors,
workmen, employees.

304
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,400
And also the names
of any of her travel companions

305
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,700
or associates.
Of course.

306
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,800
Thank you for coming in
so quickly.

307
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,100
If you learn
anything...

308
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,400
Please call.
As soon as
we know more.

309
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,300
They were really cut up.

310
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,600
Sorry.

311
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,800
It's a poor choice of words.

312
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,800
How many more of these
are we going to do?

313
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,900
Uh, at least five.

314
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,300
So pace yourself.

315
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,100
What do you mean
by that, McGee?

316
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,900
Nothing. Just, you know,
you got a little emotional

317
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,900
in there.

318
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,300
I will meet you upstairs,
Miss Dalton, okay?

319
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,300
Okay.

320
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,900
 Next of kin?

321
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,100
Abby thinks there might be more

322
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,200
body parts hidden in her
grandfather's crypt.
You talked to Abby?

323
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,500
Yeah, McGee.
I was right, wasn't I?

324
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,500
There's something wrong.

325
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,100
Let it go, probie.

326
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,600
Why?
Because

327
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,600
I'm pretty sure
it's something you did.

328
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,400
Well, what did I do?
Well, think
about it, probie.

329
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm sure you'll come up
with something.

330
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,800
 I don't understand 
what I'm supposed
to be looking at.

331
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
These photos are
of your grandfather's tomb.

332
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
I get that.

333
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,400
I assure you 
this has nothing to do
with your grandfather.

334
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,200
How could it?
He's been dead
13 years.

335
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,500
I was at the funeral.
Right.

336
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,000
It's been tampered with, okay?

337
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,900
And we believe that, uh,
there's evidence hidden inside

338
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,200
relating to an ongoing
murder investigation.

339
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,300
What kind of evidence?

340
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,500
I run my own business,
Agent DiNozzo.

341
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,500
That means I'm losing
money every minute that
I have to spend here.

342
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,900
So why don't you just tell me

343
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,500
what it is
that you want from me?

344
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,900
We need you to give us
permission to open it.

345
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,900
So if ????

346
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,900
My dad put me to work right
theseafter my grandpa died.

347
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,400
You know the first lesson
that I learned?

348
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,500
What's that?

349
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,900
Don't sign any papers without
having a lawyer look at 'em.

350
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,400
That's a good lesson.

351
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,900
But if it's necessary,
we'll get a federal warrant.

352
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,200
Oh, that would be
much easier for me.

353
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,500
You should just do that.

354
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,000
Okay.

355
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,400
Anything else you need?

356
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,700
Just a federal warrant.

357
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,700
Great.

358
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,400
Company, boss.

359
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Special Agent Gibbs.

360
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Colonel Mann.

361
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,200
I got a call your case might be
venturing into CID tto.

362
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,800
That call was premature.

363
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,500
Really? Here I thought
it was four weeks overdue.

364
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,300
 I understand you were
denied permission

365
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,900
by the family to access
Colonel Dalton's crypt.

366
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,900
Got a warrant.

367
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,600
And that got my attention.

368
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,900
Why don't you fill me in.

369
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,000
Wouldn't want to make
a bad situation worse,

370
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,900
would you?

371
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,500
Don't look
so nervous, Jethro.

372
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,200
Do I look nervous?
No.

373
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,900
You actually look, um...

374
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
you look pretty good.

375
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,800
David, DiNozzo, perimeter.

376
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,500
Sure you don't want us
to help you in there, boss?

377
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,200
'Course not, 'cause if
you did, you would've said,
"David, DiNozzo, follow me."

378
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,100
Probie, stop it.

379
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,800
We're not
going anywhere.

380
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,800
Why? What'd I miss?

381
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,100
Not like you to leave
something unfinished.

382
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
The crime scene.

383
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,400
Ever worry
you're slipping?

384
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,600
No.

385
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,000
Any suspects yet?

386
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,300
Nothing concrete.

387
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,100
What does your gut say?

388
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,800
Theory is it's
an inside job.

389
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,000
But you don't like that.

390
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,300
So how else would he know

391
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,400
which crypts

392
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,600
are vacant?

393
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,400
Ah, read the
faceplates.

394
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So the warrant didn't
exactly specify

395
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,500
what we're looking for here.

396
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,800
Well, it's best
to not have expectations.

397
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,800
It staves off
disappointment.

398
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,400
What are we hoping for?

399
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,600
You throw that "we" word around
pretty casually.

400
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,200
The last time someone tried to
remove one of these, it blewp

401
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,900
in his face.
Ah.

402
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,300
You might want to step back
a little bit.

403
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,100
Thank you for your concern.

404
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,100
I see what you mean.

405
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,900
Expectations.

406
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,600
 Gibbs did not look happy
to see her.

407
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,000
His body language suggested

408
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,600
he was not comfortable at all.

409
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,900
Eh, nothing makes
Gibbs uncomfortable.

410
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,600
Nothing job-related.

411
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,100
You think he ended it with her?

412
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,900
Assuming that
he started something.

413
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
I don't buy it.

414
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,200
Why not?
For one, she's
not a redhead.

415
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,400
People do change, Tony.

416
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,100
It's true-- even you
have a girlfriend.

417
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,100
I haven't changed.

418
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,100
Really? What about
the pretty girl in the office.

419
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,300
 ???

420
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,500
 ???

421
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,400
 didn't
flirt with her.

422
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,700
That would've been
unprofessional.

423
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,900
I don't know.

424
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,700
Might have gotten her
to sign the authorization.

425
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,700
Then we would not have
needed the warrant.

426
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,600
Then Colonel Mann
wouldn't have been here.

427
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,200
And we would be inside
doing our job.

428
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,600
Like professionals.
All because

429
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,400
you don't flirt anymore.
Why is that?

430
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,400
Enough gossip, McGee.
Tony, you like

431
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
to talk about
everyone's private lives.

432
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,100
Talk, yes.

433
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,800
But I don't write entire
books about them, do I?

434
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,200
Does create a bit of a trust...

435
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,200
issue, McGee.

436
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,300
 Excuse me. Hi.

437
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,800
Am I able to go inside today?

438
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,700
The mausoleum
is closed, sir.

439
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,500
Here it is.

440
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,900
Are you gonna let me in?

441
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,900
I think we should be clear
on the implications first.

442
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,900
You're interfering
with my investigation.

443
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,400
Is that what I'm doing?
Honestly, I'm not sure.

444
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,900
If there's evidence in here,

445
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,100
I'm gonna be obligated
to see this through to the end.

446
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,600
And if there's not?
Then I don't see

447
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,500
why my involvement
shouldn't end right here.

448
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,200
If you wanted to see me,

449
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,600
you didn't have
to manufacture a reason.

450
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,300
I follow the orders
of the United States Army,

451
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,600
even when they don't
exactly make sense.

452
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,500
You could've called.
So could you.

453
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,900
I distinctly remember
the last thing you said

454
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,900
as you were slinking
out of my bedroom...

455
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,800
I don't slink.

456
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,800
"I'll call you."
For the record,
I didn't think the last time

457
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,200
we saw each other was gonna be
the last time we saw each other.

458
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,200
Neither did I.

459
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,600
Well, here we are.

460
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,300
Lucky for us.

461
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,700
Call it fate.

462
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,000
You're just gonna
let fate decide

463
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,800
whether we go our separate ways?

464
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,500
Five bodies in total.

465
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,000
We've only
recovered portions.

466
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,700
You're hoping the rest

467
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,200
are in here.
Aren't you?

468
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:18,499
Honestly,

469
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,900
I'm not really sure.

470
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,200
 ???

471
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,400
If the bodies recovered
from the mausoleum were,

472
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,200
in fact,
the result of mass murder,

473
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,100
one might expect
a certain modicum

474
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,400
of consistency
in the manner of death.
One might.

475
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,500
Yes. And one
would be wrong. Shot,

476
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,000
stabbed, strangled,

477
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,100
bludgeoned,
and poor Miss Undetermined

478
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,300
Torrance. Three women,

479
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,600
two men, ages ranging from

480
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,100
19 to 70. Three
are Caucasian,

481
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,800
one Asian, and one black.

482
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,100
No common traits.
Not in life.

483
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,500
But the blood, however,
settled on different surfaces

484
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,900
on each of the bodies.

485
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,700
Her left thigh and back,

486
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,900
his chest and buttocks,
meaning....

487
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
The bodies
were moved repeatedly.

488
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:22,799
Precisely.

489
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,900
They were killed
and then moved

490
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
for some sort of preparation.

491
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,800
You can see the indentations
on the ankles

492
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,400
here and here, here.

493
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,000
Chain-link.

494
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,400
Yes. I believe
the bodies

495
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,300
were suspended and drained
prior to being, well,

496
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
there's only one
word for it.
Butchered.

497
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,200
We sent the tissue 
samples to Abby.
Hopefully, she can...

498
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Speak of the devil.

499
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,500
What we have here is
paradoxical behavior.

500
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,500
On one side, we have...

501
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,000
An emotional,
unrestrained murderer

502
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,000
using whatever
means at hand.

503
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,600
Yes. And, on the other,
someone tidy, meticulous,

504
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,600
and almost flawless

505
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,100
in the way he dissected
these bodies.

506
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,300
That wasn't Abby.

507
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,700
That was the Director.
She wants to see you.

508
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,900
Both of you.

509
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,900
As far as we can tell,

510
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,100
the only thing that brought
these people together

511
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,700
is how they were taken apart.

512
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,500
In addition to Marilyn Torrance,

513
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,500
we have a 19-year-old runaway
from Florida. He was shot.

514
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,800
30-year-old prostitute.

515
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,300
She was strangled.

516
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,300
No next of kin
on either of them.

517
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,900
Wade Carlin, 26-year-old
Georgetown graduate

518
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,600
from Michigan.
He broke off contact
with his parents

519
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,600
after his girlfriend dumped him
six months ago.

520
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,800
They thought he was Jack
Kerouac-ing around the country.

521
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,200
When, in fact,
he was stabbed to death

522
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,600
a few weeks after the breakup.

523
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,100
All missing persons cases.
All have led to nowhere.

524
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,000
Until now.

525
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,400
Gloria Grady,

526
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,100
age 72. Ducky says
she was the first victim.

527
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:54,899
Blunt trauma.

528
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,000
Only one relative-- her son,

529
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,800
Len Grady.

530
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,500
He was at James River.

531
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,100
With a bouquet of flowers.

532
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Lilies. For who?

533
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
No record of any Grady
at James River.

534
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,600
Could be under
a different name.

535
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,700
Could be
a friend.

536
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,900
But lilies. They're feminine.

537
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,300
The kind you give
to a woman.

538
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Like your mother.

539
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,300
Grady's mother.
I don't know your mother.

540
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,500
Could be visiting
his trophies.

541
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,600
Fits the classic profile:
30s, single, white.

542
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,600
 ???

543
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,200
Yeah? Why don't we wait
till he gets out?

544
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,400
Unless <i>you</i> want
to be the one to
interrupt his meeting.

545
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,000
Campfire's over.

546
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,400
Okay. Well, thank you, Colonel.

547
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
I will get her back to you
as soon as possible.

548
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,400
 Your superiors have agreed

549
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,700
to loan us your services
for the interim.

550
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,000
I trust that there's
not a problem with that?

551
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,300
No. Of course not,
Director.

552
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,000
As long as Special Agent Gibbs
continues to be forthcoming

553
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,400
with pertinent
information.

554
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
Agent Gibbs?

555
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,100
As long as she follows my lead,
I can't foresee a problem.

556
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,600
You two have worked cases
together successfully

557
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,300
in the past. Nothing's changed

558
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,900
to interfere
with that professional

559
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,500
relationship,
has there?

560
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,000
What do we have so far?

561
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,700
Four confirmed homicides.
Likely, five.

562
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,700
That's all you know?
I know we're wasting time

563
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,700
debating
jurisdictional protocol

564
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,500
and discussing
who's entitled to tlat.

565
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,100
Well, then, why don't
you get back to it?

566
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,100
Yeah. Thank you.

567
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,500
Um... Not you,

568
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,400
Colonel Mann.

569
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,100
I'd like to have
a private word with you.

570
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,100
Um... Breaking in a new pair?

571
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,800
No. I always wear thesea
Why do I always wear these?

572
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,200
Let me see your shoes.
Okay.

573
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,700
Flat, sensible, functional.
Not very sexy, but....

574
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,000
But they do the trick.

575
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,300
What do I want
three-inch platforms?

576
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
I'm already five-ten.

577
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,100
I love these shoes...
just all wrong.

578
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,300
Wrong for who?

579
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,600
The tissue samples.

580
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,300
.
I don't follow.

581
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,100
You don't want to
hear about shoes.
You want to hear

582
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,500
about tissue samples.
Sure.

583
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,500
I ran the Torrance tissues
through the mass spec,

584
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,800
and I found abnormal levels
of chlorine.

585
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,200
Chlorine?
Yeah.

586
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,500
Like in a swimming pool.

587
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,700
Len Grady's Website.

588
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,500
He's a jack-of-all-trades.
Basically,

589
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,900
a guy with a big van.

590
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,200
And a little
initiative.

591
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,300
Something
of an amateur entrepreneur.

592
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,500
That's not
easy to say.

593
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,300
Carpenter, plumber,
gardener, electrician,
TV installations,

594
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,700
snow shoveling....
But, most importantly,
pool cleaning.

595
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,800
That supposed to mean something?

596
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,300
Well, he's not just
any pool man. He's the
Torrances' pool man.

597
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,900
Grady's got his own key.

598
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,100
Heated. Indoor. Regular
monthly maintenance.

599
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,600
I looked into it.
Royalty checks

600
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,900
burning a hole in your pocket,
McGee?

601
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,600
Already tied Grady
to his mother.

602
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,000
Body number one.

603
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,700
And now Torrance.
Body number two.

604
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,800
Let's bring him in.

605
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,600
A lot of people 
were pleased
to see Sharif off the streets.

606
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
My superiors
acknowledged your letter

607
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,300
of commendation. I want you
to know I appreciate it.

608
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,900
The two make
an effective team.

609
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,600
Gibbs and myself?

610
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,700
Well, it wasn't just a flash
in the pan, was it?

611
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,800
Your service at CID

612
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,400
is up in six months.

613
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,200
You must have started
considering life
after the military.

614
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,900
Yes. It has crossed my mind.

615
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,800
The question is how
to best serve your future.

616
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,500
Where the opportunity for advancement lies.

617
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,200
It's not too early
for a cocktail, is it?

618
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,000
The sun must be down somewhere.

619
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,700
You drink bourbon?

620
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,200
No. Not regularly.

621
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,500
Spend enough time around Gibbs,
and you'll learn.

622
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,100
Believe me.

623
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,100
It's an acquired taste.

624
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,200
And when did you
first acquire it?

625
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,300
It's been a while.

626
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,900
But it's something
that stays with you though.

627
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,300
Nobody's home, Boss.

628
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,000
Neighbor said he went out
about an hour ago.

629
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,200
What do we do?

630
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
We wait.

631
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,800
Okay.

632
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,800
Colonel Mann still in
with the Director?

633
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,300
What do you think
they're talking about?

634
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,600
We wait... silently.

635
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,300
Okay.

636
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,500
I got him.

637
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,400
Len Grady?

638
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,300
Freeze!

639
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,100
Federal agents.

640
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,000
Up, up, up!

641
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,600
What? What?

642
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,500
Bachelor living.

643
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,000
Not every bachelor.

644
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,800
This guy's got a card
for everything.

645
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,700
"Len Grady, Painter."

646
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,900
"Len Grady, Fountain Design."

647
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,100
"Cottage cheese ceilings removed

648
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,400
and made smooth."

649
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,200
Anything with a blade on it,
we should get

650
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,200
to Abby.
Not really what she wants.

651
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,900
She's upset about her shoes.

652
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,300
Doesn't sound like Abby.

653
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,800
Wrong pair of shoes
can reduce a woman to tears.

654
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,000
She was crying?

655
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,200
Practically.

656
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,700
It's not the shoes.

657
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,400
Got something. Yep.

658
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,400
White paper package 
tied with brown string.

659
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,100
What's that?

660
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,900
It's a pork chop.

661
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,900
Hear you got
our guy in there.
Maybe.

662
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,400
What?
Nothing.

663
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,800
It seems like you
were thinking something.

664
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,000
That's been known to happen.

665
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,100
Something about me.

666
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,400
Thought I regnized
your perfume.

667
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,800
I don't wear perfume.

668
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,300
Must have been something else.

669
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,900
 So... can I just go ahead

670
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,200
and pay thfine
and get out of here?

671
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,800
Fine?

672
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,900
I know I shouldn't have cashed

673
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,500
my mother's
Social Security checks.

674
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,800
We're not the IRS.

675
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,100
She went missing last March.

676
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
She had dementia.

677
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,100
It was getting worse.
She must have

678
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
gotten out one day.

679
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,700
We're talking about
a person here, not a dog.

680
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,900
I keep hoping she'll come back.

681
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,500
You already know
where to find her.

682
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,100
How do I know that?

683
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,500
You went to visit her.

684
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,700
Brought her flowers.

685
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,500
My mother's at the cemetery?

686
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,000
What's left of her.
She was dismembered.

687
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,300
 Look at his mind spinning.

688
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,300
He's trying to figure out
how to play it.

689
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,300
I didn't do that.

690
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,200
I took care
of my mother.

691
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,800
I fed her.

692
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,200
I cleaned up after her.

693
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,800
You must have
been praying
for it to end.

694
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,700
I loved my mother!

695
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,000
Maybe you were right
the first time.

696
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,700
It must have been
like putting down a dog.

697
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,700
Only no one
ever noticed.

698
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,100
Getting away with it must have
been the real shocking part.

699
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,700
And a new
career is born.

700
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
You did it again...

701
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
and again.

702
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,400
Kelly Camarda, Wade...

703
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,200
Something's not right.

704
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,000
What do you mean?

705
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,300
He looks relieved.

706
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Gloria Grady.

707
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,600
Okay. Stop.

708
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,400
You have something
you want to tell us?

709
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,200
All these people
were chopped up?

710
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,700
That's disgusting.

711
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,800
What kind of person
do you think could do that?

712
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,900
I mean, you're
looking for a monster.

713
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,500
What do you want me to say?

714
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,600
It's not me.

715
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,000
What now?

716
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,800
Want me to do
a lie-detector test

717
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,700
or something?
You just did.

718
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,400
He's telling the truth.

719
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,800
You think I'm wrong?

720
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,900
No. But he was
relieved when

721
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,600
you connected her with
the rest of the bodies.

722
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,800
He has no feelings 
about them at all.

723
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,300
Doesn't mean
he wasn't involved.
Maybe.

724
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,700
But that doesn't look like
a man who feels trapped.

725
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,400
That looks like a man who
knows he has a way out.

726
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,900
There's something
much worse than
Len Grady out there.

727
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,600
 ???

728
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,600
We've got to push Grady harder
to tell us what he knows.

729
00:31:52,601 --> 00:31:53,399
He won't.

730
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,100
You think he's protecting
the real killer?

731
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,100
He's protecting himself.

732
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,300
I can prove 
that he's not
acting alone.

733
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,700
Trying to run down
Grady's van.

734
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,700
No luck so far.

735
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,900
He was on foot
when you apprehended him.

736
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,800
So what did he do
with his ride?

737
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,300
d when did he do it?

738
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,100
After he spotted us
at the cemetery.

739
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,700
What, he just happened
to be visiting?

740
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,600
There's no such thing
as a coincidence.

741
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,100
Well, he wanted
information.

742
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,500
He was there to watch us.

743
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,500
But he got there
as quickly as I did,

744
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,200
so how did he know
about the investigation?

745
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,100
He's got a friend
on the inside.
Uh-huh.

746
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,900
One person's a psychopath,

747
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,200
two people's a conspiracy.

748
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,700
So who was he
talking to?

749
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,700
Grady doesn't leave here

750
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
until we know
everything about him.

751
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,500
You start with yesterday
and yowork backwards.

752
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,800
Go.

753
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,100
Forensics?

754
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,300
Boss...
Yeah.

755
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,400
Um, if you're going
to go see Abby,

756
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,200
I think you should know
she's going through something...

757
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,200
I'm not going
empty-handed, McGee.

758
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Gibbs.

759
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,800
And Lieutenant Colonel Mann.
Abby.

760
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,900
Can I interest you
in some knives?

761
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,900
I've got kitchen knives,
pen knives,

762
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:05,699
pocket knives,

763
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,800
Swiss army knives,
razor blades, X-acto blades,

764
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,300
scissors, saws, scalpels,
hedge clippers,

765
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,200
an adze, an awl,
a fish scaler

766
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,600
and even a golf-hole cutter.

767
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,000
All recovered from
Grady's pigsty?

768
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,700
Reflected in the care he used
to maintain his cutlery,

769
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,400
there's dings and nicks
and dull edges.

770
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,300
None of these correspond
to any of the precise incisions

771
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,000
used to dismember
the corpses.

772
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,200
For such a slob,

773
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,000
he certainly is reful
when it counts.

774
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,700
There wasn't a single trace
of human blood anywhere.

775
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,100
Human blood...

776
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,300
Your boy Grady is something
of a carnivore.

777
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,000
From the remnants
on his silverware,

778
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,400
I could pretty much tell you
every meal he had for a week.

779
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,300
Liverwurst, knockwurst,

780
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,500
pastrami, roast beef,
rack of lamb.

781
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,800
Which leads us to...

782
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,800
this.

783
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,200
The pork chop
from his freezer.

784
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,600
Probably his next meal.

785
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,400
When I pull it up,
it gets really interesting.

786
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,600
It matches the incisions
on the bodies.

787
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,500
Tool mark analysis

788
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,900
isn't as precise as say
fingerprints or ballistics,

789
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,500
but I can conclusively tell you
that none of the blades

790
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,800
in Grady's possession
carved that pig.

791
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,900
Well, why would they?

792
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,200
He probably had it carved.

793
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,800
His partner's a butcher.

794
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,300
Don't you have work to do?

795
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,100
Look, it's not something

796
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,800
that you can fix in the classic
Gibbs hit-and-run style, okay?

797
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,200
I got time, Abs.

798
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,100
It's stupid.

799
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,800
It's just... a guy.

800
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,500
I'm not going to start
spilling my guts

801
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,800
just because you
keep standing here.

802
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,300
All right, apparently
I am too much for him.

803
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,500
Can you imagine that?

804
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:05,299
Me?

805
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,900
And it's not what you think.

806
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,500
It's not all tot a

807
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,900
He likes...
he likes small women.

808
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,400
I got dumped 'cause
I'm too... too big.

809
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,300
And don't even bother

810
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,300
with the, "No, it's him.
He's too small."

811
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,500
or "If he can't accept you
for who you are

812
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,400
then it's his problem," thing.

813
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,200
He just doesn't think

814
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,600
that we could make it work

815
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,300
and I've done everything I can

816
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,600
to try to convince him
that he's wrong.

817
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,300
So I guess

818
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,200
I'm just going to have
to accept it.

819
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,000
And let it go.

820
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,400
Thanks, Gibbs.

821
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,300
You always know what to say.

822
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,900
Metro P.D. responded
to the BOLO on Grady's van.

823
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,900
So far 13 possibles
and counting.

824
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,200
McGee.

825
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,200
Supermarkets,
slaughter houses,

826
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,400
any place with a
butcher on site

827
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,800
within a 20-block radius
of Grady's residence.

828
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,700
Narrow the search 
to boutique shops.

829
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,900
They'd need
their privacy.

830
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,900
There's just one.

831
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,800
Just one?

832
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,600
Boutique butcher's
a dying industry.

833
00:36:23,601 --> 00:36:24,399
Where?

834
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,300
Le Cochon, Mass Avenue.

835
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,700
All right, get
a list of employees,

836
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,300
owners past and present.

837
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,300
Let's roll.

838
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,500
Ms. Dalton.

839
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,300
I thought you said
you didn't need me.

840
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,400
What's yWhr relationship
with Len Grady?

841
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,200
Len, he's my boyfriend.
Why? What's going on?

842
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,300
You told Grady you spoke
with us earlier?

843
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,400
Yeah, I mentioned it.

844
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,000
Is this about the investigation?

845
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,400
Where is Len?

846
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,500
In custody.

847
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,900
We suspect he's committed
at least five murders.

848
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,500
That's impossible.

849
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,900
Len would never hurt any...

850
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,500
Five?

851
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,500
At least.

852
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,400
Where's your freezer?

853
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,000
Nothing in here, Boss.

854
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,500
Just pork, beef and lamb.

855
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,800
What else would there be?

856
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,900
Human blood.

857
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,700
Human?

858
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,300
What's in here?

859
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
It's a freezer I use
for overflow to store

860
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,300
geese and turkeys
in the holidays.

861
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,100
Got a key?

862
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,000
What kind of evidence
did you say that you found

863
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,400
in my grandfather's crypt?

864
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,800
Does Grady has access
to your store?

865
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,900
He's here all the time.

866
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,000
Look, this can't be
happening, okay?

867
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,200
There must be some kind of...

868
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,700
He was a regular customer.

869
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,800
Every week like clockwork.

870
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,000
It was the only time that he
could get away from his mother.

871
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,800
He felt trapped.

872
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,100
I could tell that he needed
to get on with his life.

873
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,600
It started with
a few words

874
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,400
here and there.

875
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,300
And then...

876
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,300
before long we were...

877
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,300
Together.

878
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,900
Not fully, no.

879
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,100
We didn't trade keys until...

880
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,500
after she, uh, disappeared.

881
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,500
He learned your trade.

882
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,900
I taught him.

883
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
He always wanted
to try new things.

884
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,100
I never suspected that...

885
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,300
How could I not have seen it?

886
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,100
Love makes you blind.

887
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,500
No.

888
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,800
I must be some kind of monster.

889
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,600
Is she the monster
you were talking about?

890
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,700
No, she loves me.

891
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,500
How?

892
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,700
We're  love.

893
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,600
 Then she had to know
about it.

894
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,600
She had to know the real you.

895
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,800
She didn't do anything.

896
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,800
You're right.

897
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,200
She could have stopped you.

898
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,000
She should have stopped you.

899
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,500
If it was real.

900
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,400
She didn't know!

901
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,600
I hid it.
I hid everything.

902
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,500
Just leave her out of it.

903
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,100
Natalie!

904
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,700
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, Natalie!

905
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,500
I'm so sorry!

906
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,300
 I love you!
I love you so much!

907
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,200
I'm sorry!

908
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Let's try this again.
Marilyn Torrance.

909
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,400
She was swimming in her pool.
I drowned her.

910
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,700
Wade Carlin.

911
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,400
Natalie was at
the wholesale market.

912
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,200
He came in for a sandwich.
I stabbed him.

913
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,300
She was a hooker.

914
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,000
I was lonely.
Natalie was out of town.

915
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,700
I strangled her.

916
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,900
And the kid was nobody.

917
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,700
Nobody. I just shot him.

918
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,500
You kept them in the freezer
for over a year.

919
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,800
Why'd you move the bodies?
Why did you move them?

920
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,600
He needed the space.

921
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,900
No one could stop me.

922
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,800
You were gonna kill again.

923
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,500
He already did.

924
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,900
What did you do with the body?

925
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,900
Doesn't matter.

926
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,900
Doesn't matter.

927
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,000
No, no... No. No!

928
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,900
No! Natalie!

929
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,300
Find the van.

930
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,600
Find the body.

931
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
Let her go.

932
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,400
Still at work?

933
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,700
Yeah, I was just catching up

934
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,500
on some things.

935
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
Cheek swabs.

936
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,700
Hey, your music's back on.

937
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,300
You're feeling good again.

938
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,700
Maybe not good.

939
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,600
Not yet.

940
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,500
But better.

941
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,900
You know how sometimes a guy

942
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,200
can get you all tied up inside.

943
00:41:28,201 --> 00:41:28,999
Yes.

944
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,800
And then you can't
get the knots out?

945
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,100
Yes.

946
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,300
Well, it just really helped me
to talk things out with Gibbs.

947
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,900
You know, unknot the knots.

948
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,600
'Cause even if you
don't let it show,

949
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,300
people can still tell.

950
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,800
So, you know, if you ever want

951
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,500
to talk about
Lieutenant Sanders...

952
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,300
I liked him.

953
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,300
He died.

954
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,300
And what else is there to say?

955
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,700
Well, I am glad you feel better.

956
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,900
With the right partner,

957
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,900
you can make the perfect,
monster , huh?

958
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,300
Give me a little
old-time romance.

959
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,700
Someone's got hidden
skeletons of his own.

960
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,900
If I ever find myself
in a dire situation,

961
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,800
the proverbial body
I need to get rid of...

962
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,100
I think I would tell you.

963
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,700
Yeah?
Yeah.

964
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,300
What makes you think
I wouldn't turn you in?

965
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,600
If there's one thing you're
good at, Jethro, it's
keeping your mouth shut.

966
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,200
You made the right call
letting the girl go.

967
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,700
Seems you always
make the call

968
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,500
when it involves a case.

969
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,700
Son of a...

970
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,800
