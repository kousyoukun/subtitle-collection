1
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:11,126
Welcome home, Director.

2
00:00:11,127 --> 00:00:12,754
How was the Interpol conference?

3
00:00:12,755 --> 00:00:16,228
Fine. Full of Euro cops
trying to hook up with me.

4
00:00:16,477 --> 00:00:17,971
And, no, I didn't.

5
00:00:17,972 --> 00:00:19,397
Oh, I wasn't wondering if...

6
00:00:19,398 --> 00:00:22,533
I would if I were you.
Now, get in, Cynthia.

7
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:32,635
Is the agency still intact after
a week with Gibbs in charge?

8
00:00:32,636 --> 00:00:34,280
We survived.

9
00:00:34,919 --> 00:00:36,484
Did Gibbs?

10
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:38,043
Barely.

11
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:18,266
<i>Cleared customs see ya soo...</i>

12
00:01:18,309 --> 00:01:20,743
Team-NCIS.com presents :

13

Capture : Swsub.com

16
00:01:33,585 --> 00:02:03,300


17
00:02:09,582 --> 00:02:12,515
- Welcome home, señora.
- Thank you, Noemi.

18
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:14,565
You hungry, señora?

19
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:16,428
No, I ate on the plane.

20
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:18,638
I fix your favorite paella.

21
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,032
- Very well. I'll have a little.
- Okay.

22
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,234
- Will there be anything else, Director?
- No.

23
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,399
Take Cynthia home.

24
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,530
She's going to argue, but it's silly
for her to go back to the office now.

25
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:40,178
Understood.

26
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:42,189
What time tomorrow, Director?

27
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,437
05:30, Melvin.
I want to get an early start.

28
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:47,082
Yes, ma'am.

29
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,995
Noemi, I'll eat in the study.

30
00:02:50,096 --> 00:02:52,305
Si, señora.

31
00:03:02,136 --> 00:03:05,677
My father has been dead since '95.

32
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:08,304
He stood

33
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:12,366
where you stand
three weeks ago.

34
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:18,118
Noemi!

35
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,365
Si, señora?

36
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:22,906
Who's been in my study?

37
00:03:23,178 --> 00:03:24,743
No one, señora.

38
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:29,425
Obviously someone.

39
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:33,419
You no do that?

40
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,591
I no do that.

41
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,443
Maybe before you leave?

42
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:43,732
I've been gone for five days.
Didn't you clean in here?

43
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:44,920
Si, señora.

44
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:48,465
I... I no see.

45
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:50,294
I'm sorry, señora.

46
00:03:51,442 --> 00:03:54,245
It's nothing, Noemi.
Don't worry about it.

47
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,598
Okay, I know this looks a little weird,

48
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,936
but I couldn't get my hands on a real
polygraph machine, so I made one.

49
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:10,285
Name.

50
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,881
Name! Tell me your name!

51
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:15,734
Stop acting like a Nazi. Come over here.
Scratch my nose, please.

52
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:17,665
Right side, right side.

53
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,611
Ow! God, not so hard!

54
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:22,342
McGee, stop being such a baby.
Name.

55
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,077
Timothy McGee...
no middle initial.

56
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:27,203
Have you ever used an alias?

57
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:29,419
Does a nom de plume count?

58
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:31,012
It does.

59
00:04:31,013 --> 00:04:32,684
Thom E. Gemcity.

60
00:04:32,685 --> 00:04:33,927
Any other names?

61
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:35,840
No.

62
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,673
- No?
- No.

63
00:04:38,674 --> 00:04:42,247
Okay, either you or my polygraph is
lying. And since this is a machine and

64
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,142
- it can't lie...
- HAL lied through his chips.

65
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:46,923
I thought the expression was
"to lie through your teeth. "

66
00:04:46,924 --> 00:04:49,881
HAL, the computer. 2001?
Sci-fi classic?

67
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:52,047
How can a six-year-old movie be a classic?

68
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:54,353
The film that was made in 1968.

69
00:04:54,354 --> 00:04:56,584
2001 : A Space Odyssey directed
by Stanley Kubrick.

70
00:04:56,585 --> 00:04:58,262
How long do you have to
be in this country...

71
00:04:58,263 --> 00:05:00,653
I'm trying to prep McGee
for his polygraph on Monday.

72
00:05:00,654 --> 00:05:02,114
Really?

73
00:05:02,365 --> 00:05:06,394
Well, unless you're a spy, McGeek,
the thought of which is utterly ludicrous.

74
00:05:06,395 --> 00:05:07,673
What's the sweat?

75
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,982
He panics taking tests.

76
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:11,963
It's not uncommon.

77
00:05:11,964 --> 00:05:14,485
Started in kindergarten.
Couldn't change his answer.

78
00:05:14,486 --> 00:05:17,242
- Hard to erase crayon.
- Tony, it's not funny.

79
00:05:17,243 --> 00:05:21,373
Retaining my Special Agent status
is dependent on passing this polygraph.

80
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:23,655
Oh, this is definitely a lie.

81
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,916
- What'd you ask him?
- His name.

82
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:27,396
You lied about your name?

83
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,706
No.

84
00:05:28,707 --> 00:05:30,604
Timothy McGee is my legal name.

85
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:33,958
Thom E. Gemcity is my pen name.
I don't have any other names.

86
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,536
- Probie.
- Yeah, boss.

87
00:05:35,537 --> 00:05:38,466
And Elf Lord.
Two other names.

88
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:40,714
Why are you torturing McGee?

89
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,615
I am not torturing McGee.
I am prepping him.

90
00:05:43,616 --> 00:05:46,045
He has his CPS polygraph on Monday.

91
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,275
- Who ordered that?
- Homeland Security.

92
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:52,011
All NCIS agents must take it,
directors included.

93
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,575
Check your e-mails.

94
00:05:56,344 --> 00:05:57,803
Monday, 09:00.

95
00:05:57,804 --> 00:05:59,823
Tuesday, 13:00.

96
00:05:59,824 --> 00:06:01,474
Boss, what time is your...?

97
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:12,276
You ever seen the Angel of Death,
Dr. Benoit?

98
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:15,230
Skeleton, hooded black robe, scythe.

99
00:06:16,227 --> 00:06:17,838
I am not kidding, Doctor.

100
00:06:18,886 --> 00:06:19,886
Carly.

101
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:23,337
Not a skeleton with a grass-cutter.
That's for kids on Halloween.

102
00:06:23,338 --> 00:06:26,660
Although, if he wanted to
he could appear as a skeleton.

103
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:29,016
I take it you've seen him?

104
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:31,718
Once, when my Uncle Luis died.

105
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,270
What did he look like?

106
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,848
Miss Puerto Rico.

107
00:06:36,401 --> 00:06:39,017
What are you talking about?
You can't keep me here.

108
00:06:39,018 --> 00:06:40,987
You want to walk, walk.

109
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:43,264
I can't with this leg iron on.

110
00:06:43,265 --> 00:06:44,640
I want a cast.

111
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:46,285
After surgery.

112
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:48,432
Wait a minute...

113
00:06:48,751 --> 00:06:51,032
Wait a minute, are they...
are they going to knock me out?

114
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:52,525
Oh, I hope not.

115
00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:54,894
Where's my backpack?

116
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:59,099
Where's my bag?
I want my backpack.

117
00:07:02,515 --> 00:07:04,867
Sorry to stick you
with this one, Doctor.

118
00:07:04,868 --> 00:07:06,194
No problem, Annie.

119
00:07:06,195 --> 00:07:09,539
Dr. Jessup wants him
in monkey bars till he can operate.

120
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:16,964
Three MGs of Versed,
two of morphine, 15 minutes ago.

121
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:18,907
And he's still amped up?

122
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:21,745
I think the boy had more
on board than ER put in him.

123
00:07:21,746 --> 00:07:23,956
Patti said he wouldn't
let them take blood.

124
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:26,573
And it was a fight
just to get the leg X-rayed.

125
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:28,630
Hey, where's my phone?!
Someone stole my phone!

126
00:07:28,631 --> 00:07:29,973
You didn't come in with one, Devon.

127
00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:32,012
No, I had a cell phone!
I was texting on it when...

128
00:07:32,013 --> 00:07:34,892
When you stepped in front
of a cab at Dulles.

129
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:38,428
I'm Dr. Benoit, Devon.
Give me a minute.

130
00:07:47,872 --> 00:07:50,208
You're hypertensive and tachycardiac.

131
00:07:50,498 --> 00:07:51,790
What's that?

132
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:53,704
Not good.

133
00:07:55,495 --> 00:07:58,202
Have you taken any drugs
we don't know about?

134
00:07:59,183 --> 00:08:00,830
We're not the police, Devon.

135
00:08:02,122 --> 00:08:04,403
Our only concern is your well-being.

136
00:08:04,404 --> 00:08:08,213
I want...
I want to call my sister.

137
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,060
There's a phone in your room.

138
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:17,278
What do you think, Doctor?

139
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,461
Keep your eye out for Miss Puerto Rico.

140
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:45,444
Visiting your ex-wife?

141
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,106
Waiting for you.

142
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:48,918
How'd you know I'd be here?

143
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:51,013
Friday night. Old weekend.

144
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:52,751
<i>Hold on, Emily.</i>

145
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:55,041
Hi, Daddy!

146
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:57,210
Hey, Em. Be there in a minute.

147
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:03,638
Diane look that pissed at you
after the divorce?

148
00:09:04,131 --> 00:09:05,775
She's looking at me, Tobias.

149
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,381
Ever think of picking up a phone?

150
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,127
Hard lines are tapped.

151
00:09:11,128 --> 00:09:13,315
Cell calls snatched right out of the air.

152
00:09:13,316 --> 00:09:15,898
Turning into a conspiracy nut, Jethro.
What's next?

153
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,409
Alien abductions?

154
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,952
Only if you don't answer my question.

155
00:09:18,953 --> 00:09:20,875
- Why the polygraphs?
- No.

156
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:24,752
- Do you still dream about O.J.-ing Diane?
- Nah,

157
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:27,791
Emily kind of likes her. You?

158
00:09:28,377 --> 00:09:31,075
Only when I think about my
grandfather's railroad watch.

159
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:32,872
Beautiful chimes.

160
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:34,751
FBI being polygraphed?

161
00:09:34,892 --> 00:09:37,224
No. And before you run
through the alphabet soup.

162
00:09:37,225 --> 00:09:39,877
This net is being cast
strictly over NCIS.

163
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:41,548
Who's doing the fishing?

164
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:45,811
Obviously, someone who thinks
there's a security risk at NCIS.

165
00:09:46,113 --> 00:09:47,369
CIA.

166
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:50,004
Who are they after, Tobias?

167
00:09:52,814 --> 00:09:53,871
Your boss.

168
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:23,454
Señor Gibbs.

169
00:10:24,372 --> 00:10:25,446
Director home?

170
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:26,889
I'm in here.

171
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:36,740
In polite society,
one usually calls before a visit.

172
00:10:36,895 --> 00:10:37,902
Bourbon?

173
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:40,352
I kicked in too many doors
to be polite. Yeah.

174
00:10:41,326 --> 00:10:44,716
I appreciate the restraint
you showed by using the bell.

175
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:49,314
I've been rather fond of that
door since I was a child.

176
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:52,889
You could have waited to report
till Monday, Jethro.

177
00:10:54,258 --> 00:10:55,744
That's not why I'm here.

178
00:10:55,745 --> 00:10:57,756
You lost your protection detail in Paris.

179
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,398
You went missing for 21 hours.
Where were you?

180
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:03,643
You sound like a jealous husband.

181
00:11:03,644 --> 00:11:04,901
How would you know?

182
00:11:06,026 --> 00:11:07,452
Do you want this or not?

183
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:14,425
Don't... touch that!

184
00:11:15,046 --> 00:11:16,120
It's Scotch.

185
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:18,255
You drink bourbon.

186
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,458
So you.

187
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:26,630
I had another visitor
before you arrived...

188
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,215
unannounced.

189
00:11:29,484 --> 00:11:31,196
Did he duck out the back?

190
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,945
Now you do sound like a jealous husband.

191
00:11:37,393 --> 00:11:39,468
You go off grid for 21 hours...

192
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:43,463
and we're being polygraphed
for a security breach.

193
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,163
Drink your bourbon and
say good night, Gracie.

194
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:50,998
What were you doing
for 21 hours, Jenny?

195
00:11:51,396 --> 00:11:53,188
What we used to do.

196
00:11:53,657 --> 00:11:55,252
Ever so well.

197
00:11:57,336 --> 00:12:00,508
When you're lying,
your right eye twitches.

198
00:12:02,023 --> 00:12:03,411
It always has.

199
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,395
You know, constitutionally,

200
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:13,607
you can refuse to take a polygraph.

201
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,353
I'd have to turn in my badge.

202
00:12:15,354 --> 00:12:17,742
True, but you don't
have to take the test.

203
00:12:17,773 --> 00:12:19,460
Hey, I have an idea.

204
00:12:19,461 --> 00:12:23,253
Why don't we get Ducky to tell
the examiners that Tim is just way

205
00:12:23,254 --> 00:12:24,925
too stressed out to take the test?

206
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:27,526
Ducky's a medical examiner,
he's not a psychiatrist.

207
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:30,797
- But he does psychological profiles.
- Of serial killers.

208
00:12:30,982 --> 00:12:34,688
That's good I'll go from Federal Agent
to serial killer in one day.

209
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,154
It was just a thought.

210
00:12:37,832 --> 00:12:39,107
Here you go.

211
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:41,642
Thanks. Great bartender.

212
00:12:41,643 --> 00:12:44,167
- You can beat a polygraph.
- No, you can't.

213
00:12:44,168 --> 00:12:46,525
I've done it, Abby.
It's part of Mossad training.

214
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:48,680
- All you have to do...
- Oh, hello!

215
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:51,187
- If it's unethical, I can't hear it!
- Well, don't listen.

216
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:52,441
Fine.

217
00:12:53,046 --> 00:12:54,053
Go ahead...

218
00:12:54,054 --> 00:12:55,832
May we join you?

219
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,346
- Hey, Ducky, here take my chair.
- No, no, no, no, Timothy.

220
00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:00,097
At a bar, I prefer to stand.

221
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:01,098
Me, too.

222
00:13:01,255 --> 00:13:04,455
Macallan neat.
Mineral water on the side. No ice.

223
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:07,761
I'll take a, uh, chocolate martini.

224
00:13:08,294 --> 00:13:09,502
Just kidding.

225
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,600
Uh, make that a Green Fairy Mojito.

226
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:12,601
<i>You got it.</i>

227
00:13:12,602 --> 00:13:16,708
Why is everybody so dour?
It's TGIF and the happy hour!

228
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:20,207
Homeland Security's ordering us
to take a polygraph.

229
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,709
That's rather odd.
But there's nothing to worry about.

230
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:25,780
Unless... you're a spy.

231
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:28,206
Why are you looking at me?!

232
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:31,513
I'm trying to lighten
the atmosphere with a little humor.

233
00:13:31,514 --> 00:13:33,873
I don't think they expect you
to be funny, Doctor.

234
00:13:34,394 --> 00:13:36,952
- That didn't come out right.
- No, I should say not.

235
00:13:36,953 --> 00:13:39,541
I mean I don't think they
expect a Scotsman to be funny.

236
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:41,624
Stop digging, Jimmy.

237
00:13:41,644 --> 00:13:42,991
You've almost reached China.

238
00:13:42,992 --> 00:13:45,408
Yeah, a round for my friends on me.

239
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:48,389
Dispelling two misconceptions
about Scotsmen in one night.

240
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,203
Does anyone know where the rest rooms are?

241
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,303
- I do!
- Okay.

242
00:13:51,304 --> 00:13:54,367
One moment!
First... a toast!

243
00:13:54,368 --> 00:13:56,002
- Please, God, make it quick.
- Amen.

244
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:59,020
May the best you've ever seen
be the worst you'll ever see.

245
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:02,705
May a mouse never leave your girnal
with a teardrop in his eye.

246
00:14:02,706 --> 00:14:06,174
May you stay hale and hearty
until you're old enough to die.

247
00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:09,061
May you always be as happy
as we wish you all to be.

248
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:10,587
Guys, I'm sorry I gotta go.

249
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:11,609
Uh, me, too.

250
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,930
- Great toast, Ducky.
- Uh... thank you.

251
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:16,089
Terrific.

252
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,449
Really good, Doctor.

253
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:22,850
May a mouse never leave your girdle
with a teardrop in his eye.

254
00:14:22,851 --> 00:14:26,011
Not girdle, girnal. It's an oat bin.

255
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:29,169
If it was empty, a mouse would cry.

256
00:14:30,147 --> 00:14:32,761
To dry-eyed mice.

257
00:14:33,396 --> 00:14:34,532
Yeah, yeah.

258
00:14:37,469 --> 00:14:38,912
Stupid bastard.

259
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:42,349
I don't think that Dee meant
to get hit by a...

260
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:54,316
Why didn't you push it?

261
00:14:55,122 --> 00:14:56,767
It was lit.

262
00:14:58,085 --> 00:14:59,629
I'd have pushed it anyway.

263
00:15:00,396 --> 00:15:01,610
And why is that?

264
00:15:01,838 --> 00:15:03,120
To watch it light up.

265
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:17,018
Why don't you get her some help?
ER's on one.

266
00:15:19,777 --> 00:15:21,003
You talking to me?

267
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:25,104
Yeah, I'm talking to you, Bobby.

268
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:28,635
- His name is Nick.
- Shut up, Bernie.

269
00:15:29,038 --> 00:15:31,325
But he thinks that your name is Bobby.

270
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,812
- Don't you?
- No.

271
00:15:34,165 --> 00:15:37,929
He thinks his name is Bobby. Don't you?

272
00:15:39,316 --> 00:15:42,169
You don't think your
name is Bobby, do you, Nick?

273
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,384
Shut up. Can't you see he's a cop?

274
00:15:44,854 --> 00:15:48,044
Hey, ER said Devon Watson was up here.

275
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:50,089
He called his sister to pick him up.

276
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,770
I'm his sister.

277
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:54,539
He hasn't gone into surgery.

278
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,543
Surgery? For a broken leg?

279
00:15:57,965 --> 00:16:00,081
It's a severe compound fracture.

280
00:16:00,082 --> 00:16:01,559
Put a splint on it.

281
00:16:03,401 --> 00:16:04,840
Is there a problem here, Carly?

282
00:16:04,841 --> 00:16:07,531
I don't know.
Do we have a problem?

283
00:16:09,495 --> 00:16:10,678
No problem.

284
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:13,714
My girl's worried about
her brother, that's all.

285
00:16:13,715 --> 00:16:14,861
Wants to see him.

286
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:16,825
Yeah, can I see Dee?

287
00:16:17,153 --> 00:16:18,856
That's up to Dr. Benoit.

288
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:21,567
- I need this stat.
- Sure.

289
00:16:23,343 --> 00:16:25,767
This is Mr. Watson's sister, Dr. Benoit.

290
00:16:26,102 --> 00:16:29,626
Bernadette.
But everybody calls me Bernie.

291
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:32,700
And you are?

292
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:33,715
A friend.

293
00:16:34,403 --> 00:16:35,403
Have a name...

294
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,280
friend?

295
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:39,155
Nick.

296
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,302
He thinks his name is Bobby.

297
00:16:45,107 --> 00:16:47,580
Room 331.
Ten minutes.

298
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:49,425
I wanted to be a doctor.

299
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:50,534
Um, but my dad...

300
00:16:50,535 --> 00:16:53,011
She doesn't want to hear
about your life history, Bernie.

301
00:16:55,045 --> 00:16:57,280
<i>- I told you to keep your trap shut.
- Sorry.</i>

302
00:16:57,281 --> 00:17:00,400
I didn't think doctors
cleaned out urinals.

303
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,229
We draw the line at bedpans.

304
00:17:02,883 --> 00:17:05,263
Want to take a 15 minute break with me?

305
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,781
We'll be in the cafeteria, Carly.

306
00:17:07,782 --> 00:17:08,967
Okay, Doctor.

307
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:11,669
And clock that ten minutes.

308
00:17:19,046 --> 00:17:21,569
What's with you calling
that loser Bobby?

309
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,905
Well, he was doing DeNiro in the elevator.

310
00:17:23,906 --> 00:17:26,123
You know, like, you talkin' to me?

311
00:17:26,124 --> 00:17:27,549
You talkin' to me?!

312
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,834
So I called him Bobby.

313
00:17:28,835 --> 00:17:31,347
Sometimes you are so juvenile.

314
00:17:31,348 --> 00:17:33,439
Yes, but it makes me loveable.

315
00:17:34,613 --> 00:17:36,620
You don't look so good, Dee.

316
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:39,530
I don't feel so good, Bernie.

317
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:41,794
- Does it hurt?
- Shut up, Bernie.

318
00:17:42,597 --> 00:17:44,094
You got to get out of here.

319
00:17:44,095 --> 00:17:45,755
Man, they won't let me out.

320
00:17:45,756 --> 00:17:48,426
They can't keep you.
All you got to do is sign a release.

321
00:17:48,427 --> 00:17:50,472
What... what about my leg?

322
00:17:50,473 --> 00:17:51,782
We'll fix it later.

323
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,857
I can't walk.

324
00:17:53,858 --> 00:17:58,025
That's why they make the chairs with
those, you know, things that go round.

325
00:17:58,026 --> 00:17:59,485
Oh, wheelchairs!

326
00:17:59,737 --> 00:18:01,702
I'm really scared, man.

327
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,319
I'm feeling really cold, Nick.

328
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,473
I think I might be leaking.

329
00:18:07,474 --> 00:18:09,719
Be cool, Dee, be cool.
You're not leaking.

330
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,284
Don't let me die here, man.

331
00:18:11,285 --> 00:18:13,108
You're not going to die, honey.

332
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:14,704
I got to tell somebody.
I've got to tell somebody.

333
00:18:14,705 --> 00:18:16,846
No, no... You're not going to tell
anybody nothing!

334
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:20,036
Stop! Stop it, Nick!
You're killing him!

335
00:18:20,037 --> 00:18:21,479
Shut up.

336
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:27,023
I hope this stops by morning.

337
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:29,514
I want you to see the house in sunshine.

338
00:18:30,723 --> 00:18:31,869
It leaks.

339
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,615
No, it doesn't leak.

340
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,259
It has bats.

341
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:38,581
Bats don't come out in the sunshine.
I hate bats... ever since I saw Dracula.

342
00:18:38,582 --> 00:18:40,695
You're chickening out on me, aren't you?

343
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:43,097
After you promised?

344
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,487
Did I say Scout's honor?

345
00:18:47,797 --> 00:18:50,072
Wow, you drive a hard bargain. Okay.

346
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,529
Yes, I want to see the house.

347
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,899
Just as long as seeing doesn't
necessarily mean buying.

348
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,133
No, of course it doesn't.

349
00:19:00,147 --> 00:19:04,041
I just want you to give it
some serious consideration.

350
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:08,671
You can count on that.
Especially after last night.

351
00:19:08,672 --> 00:19:10,936
I think that, uh, you deserve...

352
00:19:10,937 --> 00:19:13,399
I'm sorry, that was
you last night, right?

353
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,842
With the mask and the strange headgear?

354
00:19:18,645 --> 00:19:19,769
Code blue.

355
00:19:20,989 --> 00:19:22,298
Code blue.

356
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,160
Hang in there, Devon. You're going
to be okay. Got the pulse ox.

357
00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:32,165
- What do we have?
- Blood pressure 80/40. Heart 150.

358
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,060
- Don't need that drug panel now.
- Where's the crash cart?

359
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:36,399
- Coming in.
- Carly and I have him.

360
00:19:36,414 --> 00:19:38,726
Annie, two milligram Naloxone I.V. push.

361
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:40,796
Got it. Two milligrams I.V. push.

362
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:42,324
Lungs are clear.

363
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:45,227
Pupils are pinpoint and un-reactive.

364
00:19:45,228 --> 00:19:48,355
B.P. 75/35,
Heart rate 160.

365
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:49,858
<i>EKG leads.</i>

366
00:19:51,486 --> 00:19:53,449
<i>Okay, lift him on three.</i>

367
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,361
<i>B.P. 65/35.
Heart rate's 175.</i>

368
00:20:00,104 --> 00:20:03,390
EKG leads in place.
He's in V-tach.

369
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:05,018
How'd he go sour so fast?

370
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:07,763
He flew in from Caracas three hours ago.

371
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:10,152
He's probably body-packing heroin.
The bags must have burst.

372
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:11,944
We've got V-fib.
He's stopped breathing.

373
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:13,152
Damn.

374
00:20:13,153 --> 00:20:15,348
Start bagging him.
Charge to 360.

375
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:17,570
Still in V-fib. Should I give him
an amp of epi?

376
00:20:17,571 --> 00:20:19,449
Not till we shock him.

377
00:20:22,744 --> 00:20:26,201
Still in V-fib.
No pressure, no pulse.

378
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:52,214
I'm sorry, Ms. Watson.

379
00:20:52,592 --> 00:20:54,747
- Me, too.
- Where's he taking him?

380
00:20:55,795 --> 00:20:56,979
Hospital morgue.

381
00:20:58,484 --> 00:20:59,746
We pick him up there?

382
00:20:59,747 --> 00:21:01,802
No, you do not pick him up there.

383
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:06,074
Sign it, Bernie.

384
00:21:09,232 --> 00:21:10,721
How's Carly?

385
00:21:10,722 --> 00:21:13,709
Not bad considering
she saw the Angel of Death.

386
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,462
What did this one look like?

387
00:21:16,463 --> 00:21:17,939
Shirley Temple.

388
00:21:18,996 --> 00:21:21,132
I don't like losing patients.

389
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:24,361
If your brother had told us
he was body-packing drugs,

390
00:21:24,362 --> 00:21:26,053
we might have saved him.

391
00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:29,657
Or if you had told us.

392
00:21:31,544 --> 00:21:33,970
I don't know what's in Dee's gut, Doc.

393
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:38,073
And neither do you.

394
00:21:38,392 --> 00:21:39,795
Now...

395
00:21:39,796 --> 00:21:41,592
where do we pick up his body?

396
00:21:43,874 --> 00:21:47,272
City morgue after he's been autopsied.

397
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:49,404
We don't need an autopsy.

398
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,298
I do.

399
00:21:55,675 --> 00:21:57,525
Come on, we got to get out of here.

400
00:22:01,176 --> 00:22:02,577
Suck it up, Bernie!

401
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,611
You got to get me somethin', Nick.

402
00:22:04,612 --> 00:22:06,376
I'm gettin' too shaky to walk.

403
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:08,871
Pharmacy downstairs. I'll get
cough syrup with codeine.

404
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:10,675
That ain't gonna help much.

405
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:12,312
Never pimp a junkie.

406
00:22:12,313 --> 00:22:15,386
- I ain't a junkie!
- Then walk out of here!

407
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:25,597
He knew Devon was body-packing
and said nothing.

408
00:22:25,598 --> 00:22:27,645
Well, he didn't want
to lose his shipment.

409
00:22:28,534 --> 00:22:30,280
That makes him an accessory.

410
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:32,670
Yeah? How could you prove that, Jeanne?

411
00:22:32,671 --> 00:22:34,867
I don't know, but I can't
just let him walk out of here.

412
00:22:34,868 --> 00:22:37,756
Dr. Benoit, you don't want
to get involved.

413
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:40,176
I am involved, Annie.
That boy didn't have to die.

414
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:42,455
No, but that is not your fault.

415
00:22:42,456 --> 00:22:45,322
Jeanne, the coroner's
going to do an autopsy.

416
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:48,326
He's going to find the
drugs, notify narcotics.

417
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:50,115
What more can you do than that?

418
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:54,103
I don't know.

419
00:22:58,887 --> 00:23:00,364
I feel so damn helpless!

420
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:05,679
They're all like that the first year.
At least the good ones.

421
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,032
It takes a little while to get calluses.

422
00:23:08,492 --> 00:23:10,780
I don't know if Jeanne ever will, Annie.

423
00:23:13,033 --> 00:23:14,259
Love.

424
00:23:19,579 --> 00:23:22,231
- You pushed the wrong button!
- Sorry.

425
00:23:26,534 --> 00:23:28,414
What are you doing down here?

426
00:23:29,303 --> 00:23:30,646
Pushed the wrong button.

427
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,735
- Morgue down here?
- Why?

428
00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:39,662
Bernie might want to take
a last look at her brother.

429
00:23:39,663 --> 00:23:41,643
Morgue's closed.

430
00:23:42,683 --> 00:23:44,936
There's no one down here, anyway.

431
00:23:45,455 --> 00:23:46,915
Her brother's here.

432
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,770
I don't think that's funny.

433
00:23:58,399 --> 00:23:59,790
Hey, boss, what's up?

434
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:01,636
There's a letter on your desk.

435
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,048
Sign it.

436
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:13,500
- What is it?
- Just sign it, Tim.

437
00:24:18,311 --> 00:24:20,593
It's a get out of jail free card.

438
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,807
Boss, why would I need such a card?

439
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:37,468
Because you're going to hack into the CIA.

440
00:24:43,193 --> 00:24:45,975
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

441
00:24:47,468 --> 00:24:50,996
Okay, I know you guys have been
working really hard lately,

442
00:24:50,997 --> 00:24:53,745
and I promised that
you could have the weekend off,

443
00:24:53,746 --> 00:24:56,066
but this sounds like an emergency,

444
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:59,540
so I need everybody
to get those electrons flowing!

445
00:24:59,993 --> 00:25:02,846
If anybody is not up to it,
I need to know now,

446
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,666
not when the Director arrives.

447
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,579
Something's wrong.

448
00:25:24,673 --> 00:25:25,714
Ready.

449
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:31,324
Thanks for coming in
on such short notice, Abby.

450
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,303
Neither rain, nor snow,
nor sleet, nor hail

451
00:25:35,304 --> 00:25:38,225
will keep this scientist
from her appointed rounds.

452
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:39,249
Nice.

453
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,191
You've adopted what
the post office has forgotten.

454
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:44,830
Did you climb the Eiffel Tower?

455
00:25:45,384 --> 00:25:46,508
No.

456
00:25:46,894 --> 00:25:48,090
No?

457
00:25:48,091 --> 00:25:51,627
How can you be in Paris
and not climb the Eiffel Tower?!

458
00:25:55,379 --> 00:25:58,324
I want to know
whose fingerprints are on these.

459
00:25:58,894 --> 00:26:01,061
Chain of evidence is not important.

460
00:26:02,738 --> 00:26:04,584
I'll be in my office.

461
00:26:14,235 --> 00:26:15,627
Boss, you were right.

462
00:26:15,628 --> 00:26:18,943
The order to polygraph
came from Homeland Security's

463
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,822
Assistant Director for
Infrastructure Protection.

464
00:26:22,202 --> 00:26:23,628
But it didn't originate from there.

465
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:27,858
I traced into his IMAP account using
an encryption algorithm developed...

466
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:30,074
You're not really interested
in how I did this, are you?

467
00:26:30,075 --> 00:26:31,501
Nope, I'm not.

468
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:36,351
Okay, well, the order went from Homeland
Security to China, then Kurdistan.

469
00:26:36,352 --> 00:26:39,252
It went through a secondary server
in India to the island of Cypress.

470
00:26:39,253 --> 00:26:41,373
Then through Puerto Rico.

471
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,780
Where it followed a bank line
back to D.C. and...

472
00:26:44,781 --> 00:26:45,854
CIA.

473
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:48,192
Specifically, their National
Clandestine Service.

474
00:26:48,193 --> 00:26:51,435
It went in and out of a maze of incoming
and outgoing Black Op chatter.

475
00:26:51,436 --> 00:26:53,734
All encrypted. That's where I lost it.

476
00:26:55,258 --> 00:26:56,672
But I found it again.

477
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,967
It's part of a Black Op.

478
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:00,462
It's code-named Lodestone.

479
00:27:00,463 --> 00:27:05,162
Running out of the CIA section for
Weapons Control and Arms Proliferation.

480
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:07,663
The Frog.

481
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:25,077
Who do I have to thank for this?

482
00:27:25,453 --> 00:27:28,223
A former FBI agent.

483
00:27:28,726 --> 00:27:30,820
You're very resourceful, Kort.

484
00:27:31,055 --> 00:27:32,179
I try.

485
00:27:32,465 --> 00:27:34,614
So you've recorded their conversations?

486
00:27:34,814 --> 00:27:35,819
No.

487
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,050
No? Why?

488
00:27:37,554 --> 00:27:40,474
You didn't want to intrude
on their privacy?

489
00:27:41,594 --> 00:27:43,877
I didn't think it was necessary.

490
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:45,689
No? Why was that?

491
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:49,130
I only needed photos for leverage.

492
00:27:50,321 --> 00:27:52,685
- This DiNozzo is married?
- No.

493
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:55,668
Then how did you intend to gain leverage?

494
00:27:59,984 --> 00:28:01,847
You intend to harm her?

495
00:28:02,669 --> 00:28:03,811
Only threaten.

496
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:09,429
He loves her?

497
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:11,309
DiNozzo...

498
00:28:12,011 --> 00:28:13,172
he's a player.

499
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,670
Never with a skirt
more than a few weeks.

500
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,406
That's too bad.

501
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,478
A man in love could be persuaded...

502
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,680
to do almost anything.

503
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:27,677
DiNozzo's a white hat.

504
00:28:28,063 --> 00:28:30,178
He won't want to see her harmed.

505
00:28:31,263 --> 00:28:33,232
Have you not noticed, Kort?

506
00:28:36,961 --> 00:28:38,740
I like white hats.

507
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:44,413
<i>Shirley Temple looked
through the door...</i>

508
00:28:44,414 --> 00:28:47,168
Shirley Temple?
I didn't say Shirley Temple.

509
00:28:47,824 --> 00:28:49,048
Who is Shirley Temple?

510
00:28:49,635 --> 00:28:52,270
A child star from the 1930s
with curly blonde hair.

511
00:28:52,271 --> 00:28:53,361
Well, you saw him.

512
00:28:53,362 --> 00:28:55,896
If you say he looked like Shirley Temple,
he looked like Shirley Temple.

513
00:28:55,897 --> 00:28:57,628
I didn't see him, Carly.

514
00:28:57,629 --> 00:29:00,364
The Angel was standing
right behind you.

515
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:01,871
Your Angel of Death...

516
00:29:01,872 --> 00:29:04,752
wandered away from her mother in ICU.

517
00:29:04,763 --> 00:29:07,565
They flew in from Paris to see
their grandfather who stroked.

518
00:29:07,566 --> 00:29:09,932
Security's been searching
the hospital for an hour.

519
00:29:10,947 --> 00:29:14,623
If you see the Angel of Death again,
her name is Sarah.

520
00:29:14,707 --> 00:29:16,821
It's just a lost little girl, Carly.

521
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:19,368
If you say so, Doctor.

522
00:29:21,701 --> 00:29:23,826
All right, well, I will
see you in the morning.

523
00:29:23,827 --> 00:29:26,584
- I gotta go.
- I'll be out at 7:00.

524
00:29:27,507 --> 00:29:30,008
And if you see a hooded skeleton, duck.

525
00:29:31,346 --> 00:29:32,404
Dr. Benoit.

526
00:29:32,844 --> 00:29:35,676
That addict and her pimp were down
in the basement asking about the morgue.

527
00:29:35,677 --> 00:29:36,825
You didn't let them stay there?

528
00:29:36,826 --> 00:29:39,104
Of course not. I made them return
with me to the ground floor.

529
00:29:39,105 --> 00:29:40,313
They leave the hospital?

530
00:29:40,314 --> 00:29:41,505
They went into the pharmacy.

531
00:29:41,506 --> 00:29:42,962
I had to return the gurney to the ER,

532
00:29:42,963 --> 00:29:45,264
but I got a feeling
they're going to try again.

533
00:29:45,265 --> 00:29:46,370
Thanks, Bill.

534
00:29:46,371 --> 00:29:49,847
Annie, call Security.
Ask them to meet me in the morgue.

535
00:29:52,152 --> 00:29:53,729
Miss me already?

536
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:58,616
Our grieving couple may be in the morgue.

537
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:02,207
Damn.

538
00:30:02,582 --> 00:30:03,993
They never make it easy.

539
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,314
He's not in the cabinet, Bernie.

540
00:30:16,784 --> 00:30:19,721
I drank the cough syrup
and it ain't doing nothing.

541
00:30:19,722 --> 00:30:21,298
No drugs in a morgue, dummy.

542
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:23,729
You want a fix...
find your brother.

543
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,270
Nick.

544
00:30:37,412 --> 00:30:38,647
Hi ya, Dee.

545
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:45,268
Hey!

546
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:47,708
Jeanne.

547
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:02,119
He's still warm.

548
00:31:05,727 --> 00:31:08,921
That's 'cause he hasn't had time to cool.
Have you, Dee?

549
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,362
Jeanne, slow down.

550
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:15,343
Is it...?

551
00:31:15,344 --> 00:31:17,155
Jeanne, hey.

552
00:31:17,426 --> 00:31:20,030
You trying to get yourself killed?
He's at least got a knife in there.

553
00:31:20,031 --> 00:31:22,379
I will not let him butcher
her brother in front of her.

554
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,472
Keep your voice down.

555
00:31:23,473 --> 00:31:25,745
Those drugs are in
25 feet of intestines.

556
00:31:26,271 --> 00:31:27,736
He doesn't know where to cut.

557
00:31:27,737 --> 00:31:29,833
He'll make a gory mess she'll
never get out of her head.

558
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:31,394
Get behind me.

559
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,348
- Why?
- Because I tell you to.

560
00:31:40,893 --> 00:31:43,662
Haven't got a weapon on you
by any chance, have you?

561
00:31:54,742 --> 00:31:56,756
I have a funny feeling, Doctor.

562
00:31:57,213 --> 00:31:58,898
It's the tequila, my dear.

563
00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:02,310
You've had three shooters
just in the time I've been here.

564
00:32:02,475 --> 00:32:06,050
Straight to voice mail.
Just like always when he's with her.

565
00:32:06,868 --> 00:32:08,966
- Tony?
- What?

566
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,650
Nothing.

567
00:32:11,651 --> 00:32:12,838
Oh, no, no, no.

568
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,947
That look was definitely something.

569
00:32:14,948 --> 00:32:17,273
Well, why do you monitor Tony?

570
00:32:17,274 --> 00:32:18,837
I don't monitor Tony.

571
00:32:18,838 --> 00:32:22,300
Oh, yes, you do, my dear,
like a mother with her toddler.

572
00:32:23,237 --> 00:32:25,402
That's a good description.

573
00:32:25,774 --> 00:32:29,028
Or a woman with a wayward lover.

574
00:32:29,465 --> 00:32:30,561
Ducky...

575
00:32:31,064 --> 00:32:33,582
do not profile me...
I'm not a killer.

576
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:38,588
Correction... I have killed before,
but never feloniously.

577
00:32:38,907 --> 00:32:40,803
Ziva, it's Friday night.

578
00:32:42,765 --> 00:32:46,377
Tony is with his girlfriend
and you are worried about him.

579
00:32:48,276 --> 00:32:49,814
What does that tell you?

580
00:32:50,277 --> 00:32:51,593
He is my partner.

581
00:32:52,028 --> 00:32:54,204
And my partner said he would be here.

582
00:32:54,366 --> 00:32:55,575
And...

583
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:00,219
and I have this...

584
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:02,988
not so good feeling.

585
00:33:12,592 --> 00:33:13,886
I didn't find nothing.

586
00:33:13,887 --> 00:33:16,839
The way you're shaking,
you couldn't find a shotgun.

587
00:33:17,023 --> 00:33:18,718
Let's see...

588
00:33:29,811 --> 00:33:31,842
You called Security, Doc?

589
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:35,517
Of course you did.
Call 'em off.

590
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:38,731
I said call 'em off.

591
00:33:38,732 --> 00:33:41,908
You haven't done anything
that can't be forgotten.

592
00:33:43,031 --> 00:33:45,704
- Do what he says, Jeanne.
- Why?

593
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:49,061
They can leave now, and we'll
forget this ever happened.

594
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:51,598
Would you do that?

595
00:33:52,757 --> 00:33:53,965
Yes.

596
00:33:56,432 --> 00:33:57,708
Tony...

597
00:34:01,982 --> 00:34:03,493
Will you forget now?

598
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,756
That's what I thought.

599
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,458
Call off Security.

600
00:34:23,038 --> 00:34:24,516
Put it on the speaker.

601
00:34:28,212 --> 00:34:29,723
Security. Jackson.

602
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,424
This is Dr. Benoit in the morgue.

603
00:34:32,425 --> 00:34:34,782
<i>Oh, sorry, Doctor.
I'll have a man there in a minute.</i>

604
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:36,914
<i>We're just stretched thin
looking for that little girl.</i>

605
00:34:36,915 --> 00:34:38,594
You can recall him.

606
00:34:38,812 --> 00:34:40,121
It was a false alarm.

607
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:43,301
<i>Okay. Can I have your
hospital I.D. number please?</i>

608
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,399
766.

609
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,453
<i>Thank you, Dr. Benoit.</i>

610
00:34:52,536 --> 00:34:54,253
Is a little girl lost?

611
00:34:55,536 --> 00:34:57,215
More than one.

612
00:34:59,632 --> 00:35:01,277
Surgery first, Doc.

613
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:03,458
No.

614
00:35:03,844 --> 00:35:04,969
No?

615
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,563
I help him first.

616
00:35:08,771 --> 00:35:10,516
You're a slow learner, Doc.

617
00:35:10,517 --> 00:35:12,682
I called off Security.

618
00:35:13,353 --> 00:35:15,500
I help him, then...

619
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:17,263
I help you.

620
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:22,113
If that's not good enough, shoot me.

621
00:35:24,227 --> 00:35:26,023
Don't hurt her, Nick.

622
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,669
Tony? Tony?

623
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,028
Can you sit up?

624
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:40,415
No, I'm up.

625
00:35:42,915 --> 00:35:44,417
Someone is looking at me.

626
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:47,802
- It's the cleaning crew.
- No, on the computer.

627
00:35:47,803 --> 00:35:50,069
I got to shut down my UPD port.

628
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:54,787
I don't think it penetrated my firewall.

629
00:35:54,788 --> 00:35:57,197
- What the hell is it?
- It's a botagent.

630
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:58,976
It's probably one of the CIA's.

631
00:35:58,977 --> 00:36:00,976
Botagent...
short for robotic agent.

632
00:36:00,977 --> 00:36:03,938
Designed to crawl the Internet
looking for snoopers like us.

633
00:36:03,939 --> 00:36:05,727
- This for real?
- Oh, yeah, boss.

634
00:36:05,728 --> 00:36:09,076
If this had penetrated my firewall,
it could have downloaded my hard drive.

635
00:36:09,077 --> 00:36:11,744
The CIA would have all our data,
and know we were onto Lodestone.

636
00:36:11,745 --> 00:36:14,129
- Can you kill it?
- No, though I could build

637
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,721
a mirror to my firewall, so that when
it looks in, it could just see itself.

638
00:36:17,722 --> 00:36:20,593
- How long?
- Too long.

639
00:36:21,466 --> 00:36:23,672
Or I could use another computer.

640
00:36:24,955 --> 00:36:26,289
Boss, just one thing...

641
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:29,232
There's always just one thing, McGee.

642
00:36:29,233 --> 00:36:32,453
A really smart botagent
won't just sit on my computer.

643
00:36:32,454 --> 00:36:35,407
It'll look for my search
patterns on the Internet.

644
00:36:35,408 --> 00:36:37,837
This is like tracking a dirtbag, McGee.

645
00:36:37,855 --> 00:36:41,068
You stake out his house.
You put out a BOLO.

646
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:43,268
Keep tabs on the girl.

647
00:36:43,978 --> 00:36:45,718
Never thought of it that way.

648
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:47,353
Start a new search.

649
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:48,672
Okay.

650
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:51,324
- What am I looking for?
- The girlfriend...

651
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:52,767
Jenny Shepard.

652
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:57,801
When you look at me like that, McGee,

653
00:36:58,204 --> 00:37:01,510
I get this overwhelming urge
to head slap you.

654
00:37:13,939 --> 00:37:16,994
I am going to get...

655
00:37:17,189 --> 00:37:19,203
a ding...

656
00:37:20,226 --> 00:37:21,360
now!

657
00:37:24,232 --> 00:37:27,114
You guys are doing this
because it's the weekend.

658
00:37:27,577 --> 00:37:30,611
And you think if you just stall,
then I'll give up

659
00:37:30,612 --> 00:37:35,231
and I'll finish the search on Monday,
but that is not going to happen.

660
00:37:35,913 --> 00:37:36,953
Abby...

661
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:38,833
you worry me.

662
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:43,482
Oh, they know I'm just, you know,
talking to them to pass the time.

663
00:37:43,483 --> 00:37:47,357
Because at this point, the fingerprint
match is totally up to AFIS.

664
00:37:47,738 --> 00:37:48,896
Right, guys?

665
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:50,557
Right, guys?

666
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,605
I'm just joshing you, Director.

667
00:37:52,606 --> 00:37:54,585
I spoiled your Friday night.

668
00:37:54,988 --> 00:37:58,624
Oh, you know, I was just
hanging at the bar.

669
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:01,982
And I probably would have been completely
passed out by now if I'd stayed.

670
00:38:01,983 --> 00:38:03,475
Joshing me again?

671
00:38:03,794 --> 00:38:04,852
No.

672
00:38:06,111 --> 00:38:07,111
Yes.

673
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:11,943
- How many prints?
- Two sets.

674
00:38:12,228 --> 00:38:15,817
He poured with his left hand
and held the glass with his right.

675
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,130
Left-handed?
Or ambidextrous.

676
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:20,229
I can pour with either hand.

677
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,008
I can tell you he's not military.

678
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:25,281
AFIS would have gotten a match
on anyone on active duty by now.

679
00:38:25,282 --> 00:38:26,674
What if he was retired?

680
00:38:26,675 --> 00:38:28,048
Covered them, too.

681
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:29,528
Dead?

682
00:38:29,926 --> 00:38:31,324
Dead?

683
00:38:31,674 --> 00:38:33,405
You said this wasn't a case.

684
00:38:33,674 --> 00:38:35,016
It's not.

685
00:38:35,218 --> 00:38:40,572
I want you to expand the search to include
servicemen alive prior to '95.

686
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:44,796
Okay.

687
00:38:49,831 --> 00:38:51,737
I don't see any signs of concussion.

688
00:38:51,738 --> 00:38:53,738
I've been hit harder by my sister.

689
00:38:54,486 --> 00:38:55,673
You don't have a sister.

690
00:38:55,674 --> 00:38:56,959
I don't?

691
00:38:57,546 --> 00:38:59,118
Nick...

692
00:39:00,142 --> 00:39:02,088
Enough playing, Doctor.

693
00:39:04,513 --> 00:39:06,425
Do it.
I don't want you to get hurt.

694
00:39:06,426 --> 00:39:07,484
Let's go.

695
00:39:17,428 --> 00:39:19,551
Half K of pure horse in here, Doc.

696
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,027
I'm no surgeon.

697
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:23,340
I'm not asking you to save a life, Doc.

698
00:39:24,749 --> 00:39:25,856
Maybe I am.

699
00:39:25,857 --> 00:39:27,686
Come on, come on, come on!

700
00:39:27,687 --> 00:39:29,716
Quit stalling. He doesn't have AIDS.

701
00:39:29,717 --> 00:39:32,043
That's not what the mask's for.

702
00:39:32,445 --> 00:39:34,174
What's it for?

703
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,882
Turn around, Bernie.

704
00:39:37,492 --> 00:39:38,661
Please hurry.

705
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,113
Why the mask?

706
00:39:41,114 --> 00:39:43,728
Tell her to turn around.

707
00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:44,886
Do it, Bernie.

708
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,662
The mask is to protect me
from disease spread

709
00:39:48,663 --> 00:39:51,649
by airborne particles released
when I open him up.

710
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,196
No more stalling.

711
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:21,112
Devon died bringing this to you.

712
00:40:21,783 --> 00:40:22,874
Want it?

713
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:24,707
What the hell do you think?

714
00:40:30,373 --> 00:40:31,464
Bitch!

715
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,334
Next one's in your ear.

716
00:40:42,284 --> 00:40:43,682
Drop it.

717
00:40:47,622 --> 00:40:48,622
You okay?

718
00:40:50,332 --> 00:40:51,406
Not really.

719
00:40:56,934 --> 00:40:58,069
Oh, God.

720
00:41:23,357 --> 00:41:24,464
Who's this?

721
00:41:25,304 --> 00:41:28,811
It's uh, Director's father...
Colonel Jasper Shepard.

722
00:41:30,807 --> 00:41:32,113
You don't know him?

723
00:41:33,496 --> 00:41:35,184
She never talked family.

724
00:41:35,185 --> 00:41:36,681
It's like you.

725
00:41:39,878 --> 00:41:41,523
She has his eyes.

726
00:41:41,937 --> 00:41:43,235
He still alive?

727
00:41:47,749 --> 00:41:48,749
Deceased.

728
00:41:50,622 --> 00:41:51,916
Suicide,

729
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,586
12 years ago.

730
00:42:16,188 --> 00:42:17,875
- There she goes.
- Who?

731
00:42:18,177 --> 00:42:19,250
Sarah.

732
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:22,133
Security found her sleeping
in the delivery room.

733
00:42:31,876 --> 00:42:35,054
You should be under
observation for 24 hours.

734
00:42:35,557 --> 00:42:37,386
Whatever doctor orders.

735
00:42:41,313 --> 00:42:42,313
What's this?

736
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:45,065
My secret.

737
00:42:48,547 --> 00:42:50,129
<i>Bonjour, Papa.</i>

738
00:42:51,518 --> 00:42:52,894
<i>Bonjour, ma fille.</i>

739
00:42:55,932 --> 00:42:58,282
So this must be Anthony DiNardo.

740
00:43:02,293 --> 00:43:04,041
Welcome to the family,

741
00:43:04,545 --> 00:43:06,189
Professeur.

742
00:43:08,494 --> 00:43:17,720
