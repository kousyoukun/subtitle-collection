1
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:12,126
Welcome home, Director.

2
00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:13,754
How was the Interpol conference?

3
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:17,228
Fine. Full of Euro cops
trying to hook up with me.

4
00:00:17,477 --> 00:00:18,971
And, no, I didn't.

5
00:00:18,972 --> 00:00:20,397
Oh, I wasn't wondering if...

6
00:00:20,398 --> 00:00:23,533
I would if I were you.
Now, get in, Cynthia.

7
00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:33,635
Is the agency still intact after
a week with Gibbs in charge?

8
00:00:33,636 --> 00:00:35,280
We survived.

9
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:37,484
Did Gibbs?

10
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:39,043
Barely.

11
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:19,266
<i>Cleared customs see ya soo...</i>

12
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:14,221
- Welcome home, señora.
- Thank you, Noemi.

13
00:02:14,861 --> 00:02:16,271
You hungry, señora?

14
00:02:16,272 --> 00:02:18,134
No, I ate on the plane.

15
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:20,344
I fix your favorite paella.

16
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:24,738
- Very well. I'll have a little.
- Okay.

17
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,940
- Will there be anything else, Director?
- No.

18
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,105
Take Cynthia home.

19
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:40,236
She's going to argue, but it's silly
for her to go back to the office now.

20
00:02:40,237 --> 00:02:41,884
Understood.

21
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:43,895
What time tomorrow, Director?

22
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:47,143
05:30, Melvin. I want
to get an early start.

23
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:48,788
Yes, ma'am.

24
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:51,701
Noemi, I'll eat in the study.

25
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:54,011
Si, señora.

26
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:07,383
My father has been dead since '95.

27
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:10,010
He stood

28
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:14,072
where you stand three weeks ago.

29
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:19,824
Noemi!

30
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:22,071
Si, señora?

31
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:24,612
Who's been in my study?

32
00:03:24,884 --> 00:03:26,449
No one, señora.

33
00:03:29,352 --> 00:03:31,131
Obviously someone.

34
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,125
You no do that?

35
00:03:36,988 --> 00:03:38,297
I no do that.

36
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,149
Maybe before you leave?

37
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:45,438
I've been gone for five days.
Didn't you clean in here?

38
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,626
Si, señora.

39
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:50,171
I... I no see.

40
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry, señora.

41
00:03:53,148 --> 00:03:55,951
It's nothing, Noemi.
Don't worry about it.

42
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,304
Okay, I know this looks a little weird,

43
00:04:05,305 --> 00:04:09,642
but I couldn't get my hands on a
real polygraph machine, so I made one.

44
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:11,991
Name.

45
00:04:12,816 --> 00:04:14,587
Name! Tell me your name!

46
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,440
Stop acting like a Nazi. Come
over here. Scratch my nose, please.

47
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:19,371
Right side, right side.

48
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:21,317
Ow! God, not so hard!

49
00:04:21,318 --> 00:04:24,048
McGee, stop being such a baby. Name.

50
00:04:24,736 --> 00:04:26,783
Timothy McGee... no middle initial.

51
00:04:26,784 --> 00:04:28,909
Have you ever used an alias?

52
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:31,125
Does a nom de plume count?

53
00:04:31,712 --> 00:04:32,718
It does.

54
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:34,390
Thom E. Gemcity.

55
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:35,633
Any other names?

56
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:37,546
No.

57
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,379
- No?
- No.

58
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,953
Okay, either you or my polygraph is
lying. And since this is a machine and

59
00:04:43,954 --> 00:04:45,848
- it can't lie...
- HAL lied through his chips.

60
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:48,629
I thought the expression was
"to lie through your teeth. "

61
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,587
HAL, the computer.
2001? Sci-fi classic?

62
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:53,753
How can a six-year-old
movie be a classic?

63
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:56,059
The film that was made in 1968.

64
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,290
2001: A Space Odyssey
directed by Stanley Kubrick.

65
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,968
How long do you have
to be in this country...

66
00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:02,359
I'm trying to prep McGee
for his polygraph on Monday.

67
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,820
Really?

68
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:08,100
Well, unless you're a spy, McGeek, the
thought of which is utterly ludicrous.

69
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:09,379
What's the sweat?

70
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,688
He panics taking tests.

71
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:13,669
It's not uncommon.

72
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,191
Started in kindergarten.
Couldn't change his answer.

73
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:18,948
- Hard to erase crayon.
- Tony, it's not funny.

74
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:23,079
Retaining my Special Agent status is
dependent on passing this polygraph.

75
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,361
Oh, this is definitely a lie.

76
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:27,622
- What'd you ask him?
- His name.

77
00:05:27,623 --> 00:05:29,102
You lied about your name?

78
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:30,412
No.

79
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,310
Timothy McGee is my legal name.

80
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:35,664
Thom E. Gemcity is my pen name.
I don't have any other names.

81
00:05:35,665 --> 00:05:37,242
- Probie.
- Yeah, boss.

82
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:40,172
And Elf Lord. Two other names.

83
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,420
Why are you torturing McGee?

84
00:05:42,421 --> 00:05:45,321
I am not torturing,
McGee. I am prepping him.

85
00:05:45,322 --> 00:05:47,751
He has his CPS polygraph on Monday.

86
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:49,981
- Who ordered that?
- Homeland Security.

87
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:53,717
All NCIS agents must take
it, directors included.

88
00:05:53,758 --> 00:05:55,281
Check your e-mails.

89
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,509
Monday, 09:00.

90
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,529
Tuesday, 13:00.

91
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,180
Boss, what time is your...?

92
00:06:11,482 --> 00:06:13,982
You ever seen the Angel
of Death, Dr. Benoit?

93
00:06:14,184 --> 00:06:16,936
Skeleton, hooded black robe, scythe.

94
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:19,544
I am not kidding, Doctor.

95
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:21,592
Carly.

96
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:25,043
Not a skeleton with a grass-cutter.
That's for kids on Halloween.

97
00:06:25,044 --> 00:06:28,366
Although, if he wanted to he
could appear as a skeleton.

98
00:06:28,993 --> 00:06:30,722
I take it you've seen him?

99
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:33,424
Once, when my Uncle Luis died.

100
00:06:34,364 --> 00:06:35,976
What did he look like?

101
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:37,554
Miss Puerto Rico.

102
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:40,723
What are you talking about?
You can't keep me here.

103
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:42,693
You want to walk, walk.

104
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,970
I can't with this leg iron on.

105
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,346
I want a cast.

106
00:06:46,347 --> 00:06:47,991
After surgery.

107
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:50,138
Wait a minute...

108
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:52,738
Wait a minute, are they...
are they going to knock me out?

109
00:06:52,739 --> 00:06:54,231
Oh, I hope not.

110
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:56,600
Where's my backpack?

111
00:06:58,137 --> 00:07:00,805
Where's my bag? I want my backpack.

112
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:06,573
Sorry to stick you
with this one, Doctor.

113
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:07,900
No problem, Annie.

114
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:11,245
Dr. Jessup wants him in monkey
bars till he can operate.

115
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,670
Three MGs of Versed, two
of morphine, 15 minutes ago.

116
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,613
And he's still amped up?

117
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:23,451
I think the boy had more
on board than ER put in him.

118
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:25,662
Patti said he wouldn't
let them take blood.

119
00:07:25,663 --> 00:07:28,279
And it was a fight just
to get the leg X-rayed.

120
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,336
Hey, where's my phone?!
Someone stole my phone!

121
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:31,679
You didn't come in with one, Devon.

122
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,718
No, I had a cell phone!
I was texting on it when...

123
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,598
When you stepped in
front of a cab at Dulles.

124
00:07:37,197 --> 00:07:40,134
I'm Dr. Benoit, Devon. Give me a minute.

125
00:07:49,578 --> 00:07:51,914
You're hypertensive and tachycardiac.

126
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:53,496
What's that?

127
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:55,410
Not good.

128
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:59,908
Have you taken any drugs
we don't know about?

129
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:02,536
We're not the police, Devon.

130
00:08:03,828 --> 00:08:06,109
Our only concern is your well-being.

131
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,919
I want... I want to call my sister.

132
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:13,766
There's a phone in your room.

133
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,984
What do you think, Doctor?

134
00:08:19,703 --> 00:08:22,167
Keep your eye out for Miss Puerto Rico.

135
00:08:45,623 --> 00:08:47,150
Visiting your ex-wife?

136
00:08:47,536 --> 00:08:48,812
Waiting for you.

137
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,624
How'd you know I'd be here?

138
00:08:50,722 --> 00:08:52,719
Friday night. Old weekend.

139
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,457
<i>Hold on, Emily.</i>

140
00:08:55,371 --> 00:08:56,747
Hi, Daddy!

141
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:58,916
Hey, Em. Be there in a minute.

142
00:09:02,615 --> 00:09:05,344
Diane look that pissed
at you after the divorce?

143
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,481
She's looking at me, Tobias.

144
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:11,087
Ever think of picking up a phone?

145
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:12,833
Hard lines are tapped.

146
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:15,021
Cell calls snatched
right out of the air.

147
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:17,604
Turning into a conspiracy
nut, Jethro. What's next?

148
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:19,115
Alien abductions?

149
00:09:19,116 --> 00:09:20,658
Only if you don't answer my question.

150
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:22,581
- Why the polygraphs?
- No.

151
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:26,458
- Do you still dream about
O.J.- ing Diane? - Nah,

152
00:09:27,231 --> 00:09:29,497
Emily kind of likes her. You?

153
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,781
Only when I think about my
grandfather's railroad watch.

154
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:34,578
Beautiful chimes.

155
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:36,457
FBI being polygraphed?

156
00:09:36,598 --> 00:09:38,930
No. And before you run
through the alphabet soup.

157
00:09:38,931 --> 00:09:41,583
This net is being cast
strictly over NCIS.

158
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:43,254
Who's doing the fishing?

159
00:09:43,255 --> 00:09:47,517
Obviously, someone who thinks
there's a security risk at NCIS.

160
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:49,075
CIA.

161
00:09:49,998 --> 00:09:51,710
Who are they after, Tobias?

162
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,577
Your boss.

163
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,042
Señor Gibbs.

164
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,034
Director home?

165
00:10:28,404 --> 00:10:29,477
I'm in here.

166
00:10:34,854 --> 00:10:39,328
In polite society, one
usually calls before a visit.

167
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:40,490
Bourbon?

168
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:42,940
I kicked in too many
doors to be polite. Yeah.

169
00:10:43,914 --> 00:10:47,304
I appreciate the restraint
you showed by using the bell.

170
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:51,902
I've been rather fond of
that door since I was a child.

171
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:55,477
You could have waited to
report till Monday, Jethro.

172
00:10:56,846 --> 00:10:58,332
That's not why I'm here.

173
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,344
You lost your protection
detail in Paris.

174
00:11:00,345 --> 00:11:02,986
You went missing for 21
hours. Where were you?

175
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:06,231
You sound like a jealous husband.

176
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,489
How would you know?

177
00:11:08,614 --> 00:11:10,040
Do you want this or not?

178
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:17,013
Don't... touch that!

179
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:18,708
It's Scotch.

180
00:11:19,732 --> 00:11:20,843
You drink bourbon.

181
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:23,046
So you.

182
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:29,218
I had another visitor
before you arrived...

183
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:31,803
unannounced.

184
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:33,784
Did he duck out the back?

185
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:38,533
Now you do sound like a jealous husband.

186
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:42,056
You go off grid for 21 hours...

187
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:46,051
and we're being polygraphed
for a security breach.

188
00:11:47,046 --> 00:11:49,751
Drink your bourbon and
say good night, Gracie.

189
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:53,586
What were you doing for 21 hours, Jenny?

190
00:11:53,984 --> 00:11:55,776
What we used to do.

191
00:11:56,245 --> 00:11:57,840
Ever so well.

192
00:11:59,924 --> 00:12:03,096
When you're lying,
your right eye twitches.

193
00:12:04,611 --> 00:12:05,999
It always has.

194
00:12:12,188 --> 00:12:13,983
You know, constitutionally,

195
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:16,195
you can refuse to take a polygraph.

196
00:12:16,196 --> 00:12:17,941
I'd have to turn in my badge.

197
00:12:17,942 --> 00:12:20,330
True, but you don't
have to take the test.

198
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:22,048
Hey, I have an idea.

199
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:25,841
Why don't we get Ducky to tell
the examiners that Tim is just way

200
00:12:25,842 --> 00:12:27,513
too stressed out to take the test?

201
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:30,114
Ducky's a medical examiner,
he's not a psychiatrist.

202
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:33,385
- But he does psychological profiles.
- Of serial killers.

203
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,276
That's good I'll go from Federal
Agent to serial killer in one day.

204
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,742
It was just a thought.

205
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,695
Here you go.

206
00:12:42,216 --> 00:12:44,230
Thanks. Great bartender.

207
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,755
- You can beat a polygraph.
- No, you can't.

208
00:12:46,756 --> 00:12:49,113
I've done it, Abby. It's
part of Mossad training.

209
00:12:49,114 --> 00:12:51,268
- All you have to do...
- Oh, hello!

210
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:53,775
- If it's unethical, I can't hear it!
- Well, don't listen.

211
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:55,029
Fine.

212
00:12:55,634 --> 00:12:56,641
Go ahead...

213
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,420
May we join you?

214
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:00,934
- Hey, Ducky, here take my chair.
- No, no, no, no, Timothy.

215
00:13:00,935 --> 00:13:02,685
At a bar, I prefer to stand.

216
00:13:02,686 --> 00:13:03,686
Me, too.

217
00:13:03,843 --> 00:13:07,043
Macallan neat. Mineral
water on the side. No ice.

218
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:10,349
I'll take a, uh, chocolate martini.

219
00:13:10,882 --> 00:13:12,090
Just kidding.

220
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,188
Uh, make that a Green Fairy Mojito.

221
00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:15,189
<i>You got it.</i>

222
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:19,296
Why is everybody so dour?
It's TGIF and the happy hour!

223
00:13:19,297 --> 00:13:22,795
Homeland Security's ordering
us to take a polygraph.

224
00:13:22,796 --> 00:13:25,297
That's rather odd. But
there's nothing to worry about.

225
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:28,368
Unless... you're a spy.

226
00:13:29,023 --> 00:13:30,794
Why are you looking at me?!

227
00:13:30,795 --> 00:13:34,101
I'm trying to lighten the
atmosphere with a little humor.

228
00:13:34,102 --> 00:13:36,461
I don't think they expect
you to be funny, Doctor.

229
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,540
- That didn't come out right.
- No, I should say not.

230
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,129
I mean I don't think they
expect a Scotsman to be funny.

231
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,212
Stop digging, Jimmy.

232
00:13:44,232 --> 00:13:45,579
You've almost reached China.

233
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,996
Yeah, a round for my friends on me.

234
00:13:47,997 --> 00:13:50,977
Dispelling two misconceptions
about Scotsmen in one night.

235
00:13:50,978 --> 00:13:52,791
Does anyone know where
the rest rooms are?

236
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:53,891
- I do!
- Okay.

237
00:13:53,892 --> 00:13:56,955
One moment! First... a toast!

238
00:13:56,956 --> 00:13:58,590
- Please, God, make it quick.
- Amen.

239
00:13:58,591 --> 00:14:01,608
May the best you've ever seen
be the worst you'll ever see.

240
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:05,293
May a mouse never leave your
girnal with a teardrop in his eye.

241
00:14:05,294 --> 00:14:08,762
May you stay hale and hearty
until you're old enough to die.

242
00:14:08,763 --> 00:14:11,649
May you always be as happy
as we wish you all to be.

243
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,175
Guys, I'm sorry I gotta go.

244
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:14,197
Uh, me, too.

245
00:14:15,707 --> 00:14:17,518
- Great toast, Ducky.
- Uh... thank you.

246
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,677
Terrific.

247
00:14:18,678 --> 00:14:20,037
Really good, Doctor.

248
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:25,438
May a mouse never leave your
girdle with a teardrop in his eye.

249
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:28,599
Not girdle, girnal. It's an oat bin.

250
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,757
If it was empty, a mouse would cry.

251
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:35,349
To dry-eyed mice.

252
00:14:35,984 --> 00:14:37,120
Yeah, yeah.

253
00:14:40,057 --> 00:14:41,500
Stupid bastard.

254
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,937
I don't think that Dee
meant to get hit by a...

255
00:14:55,297 --> 00:14:56,904
Why didn't you push it?

256
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,355
It was lit.

257
00:15:00,673 --> 00:15:02,217
I'd have pushed it anyway.

258
00:15:02,984 --> 00:15:04,198
And why is that?

259
00:15:04,426 --> 00:15:05,708
To watch it light up.

260
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:19,606
Why don't you get her
some help? ER's on one.

261
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:23,591
You talking to me?

262
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,692
Yeah, I'm talking to you, Bobby.

263
00:15:28,986 --> 00:15:31,223
- His name is Nick.
- Shut up, Bernie.

264
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:33,913
But he thinks that your name is Bobby.

265
00:15:34,395 --> 00:15:36,400
- Don't you?
- No.

266
00:15:36,753 --> 00:15:40,517
He thinks his name is Bobby. Don't you?

267
00:15:41,904 --> 00:15:44,757
You don't think your name
is Bobby, do you, Nick?

268
00:15:44,758 --> 00:15:46,972
Shut up. Can't you see he's a cop?

269
00:15:47,442 --> 00:15:50,632
Hey, ER said Devon Watson was up here.

270
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:52,677
He called his sister to pick him up.

271
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:54,358
I'm his sister.

272
00:15:55,365 --> 00:15:57,127
He hasn't gone into surgery.

273
00:15:57,128 --> 00:16:00,131
Surgery? For a broken leg?

274
00:16:00,553 --> 00:16:02,669
It's a severe compound fracture.

275
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,147
Put a splint on it.

276
00:16:05,989 --> 00:16:07,428
Is there a problem here, Carly?

277
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:10,119
I don't know. Do we have a problem?

278
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,266
No problem.

279
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:16,302
My girl's worried about
her brother, that's all.

280
00:16:16,303 --> 00:16:17,449
Wants to see him.

281
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:19,413
Yeah, can I see Dee?

282
00:16:19,741 --> 00:16:21,444
That's up to Dr. Benoit.

283
00:16:22,027 --> 00:16:24,155
- I need this stat.
- Sure.

284
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:28,355
This is Mr. Watson's sister, Dr. Benoit.

285
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,214
Bernadette. But
everybody calls me Bernie.

286
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:35,288
And you are?

287
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:36,303
A friend.

288
00:16:36,991 --> 00:16:37,991
Have a name...

289
00:16:38,713 --> 00:16:39,868
friend?

290
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,743
Nick.

291
00:16:42,158 --> 00:16:43,890
He thinks his name is Bobby.

292
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:50,168
Room 331. Ten minutes.

293
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:52,013
I wanted to be a doctor.

294
00:16:52,014 --> 00:16:53,122
Um, but my dad...

295
00:16:53,123 --> 00:16:55,599
She doesn't want to hear about
your life history, Bernie.

296
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:59,868
<i>- I told you to keep your trap shut.
- Sorry.</i>

297
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:02,988
I didn't think doctors
cleaned out urinals.

298
00:17:03,004 --> 00:17:04,817
We draw the line at bedpans.

299
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:07,851
Want to take a 15 minute break with me?

300
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:10,369
We'll be in the cafeteria, Carly.

301
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,555
Okay, Doctor.

302
00:17:11,556 --> 00:17:14,257
And clock that ten minutes.

303
00:17:21,634 --> 00:17:24,157
What's with you calling
that loser Bobby?

304
00:17:24,158 --> 00:17:26,493
Well, he was doing
DeNiro in the elevator.

305
00:17:26,494 --> 00:17:28,711
You know, like, you talkin' to me?

306
00:17:28,712 --> 00:17:30,137
You talkin' to me?!

307
00:17:30,138 --> 00:17:31,422
So I called him Bobby.

308
00:17:31,423 --> 00:17:33,935
Sometimes you are so juvenile.

309
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:36,027
Yes, but it makes me loveable.

310
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:39,208
You don't look so good, Dee.

311
00:17:39,209 --> 00:17:42,118
I don't feel so good, Bernie.

312
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:44,382
- Does it hurt?
- Shut up, Bernie.

313
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:46,682
You got to get out of here.

314
00:17:46,683 --> 00:17:48,343
Man, they won't let me out.

315
00:17:48,344 --> 00:17:51,014
They can't keep you. All you
got to do is sign a release.

316
00:17:51,015 --> 00:17:53,060
What... what about my leg?

317
00:17:53,061 --> 00:17:54,370
We'll fix it later.

318
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:56,445
I can't walk.

319
00:17:56,446 --> 00:18:00,613
That's why they make the chairs with
those, you know, things that go round.

320
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:02,073
Oh, wheelchairs!

321
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:04,290
I'm really scared, man.

322
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,907
I'm feeling really cold, Nick.

323
00:18:08,658 --> 00:18:10,061
I think I might be leaking.

324
00:18:10,062 --> 00:18:12,307
Be cool, Dee, be cool.
You're not leaking.

325
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:13,872
Don't let me die here, man.

326
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:15,696
You're not going to die, honey.

327
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:17,292
I got to tell somebody.
I've got to tell somebody.

328
00:18:17,293 --> 00:18:19,434
No, no... You're not going
to tell anybody nothing!

329
00:18:19,435 --> 00:18:22,624
Stop! Stop it, Nick! You're killing him!

330
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,067
Shut up.

331
00:18:27,681 --> 00:18:29,611
I hope this stops by morning.

332
00:18:29,863 --> 00:18:32,102
I want you to see the house in sunshine.

333
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:34,457
It leaks.

334
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,203
No, it doesn't leak.

335
00:18:36,438 --> 00:18:37,847
It has bats.

336
00:18:37,982 --> 00:18:41,169
Bats don't come out in the sunshine.
I hate bats... ever since I saw Dracula.

337
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,283
You're chickening out on me, aren't you?

338
00:18:44,343 --> 00:18:45,685
After you promised?

339
00:18:47,548 --> 00:18:49,075
Did I say Scout's honor?

340
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:52,660
Wow, you drive a hard bargain. Okay.

341
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:56,117
Yes, I want to see the house.

342
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:59,487
Just as long as seeing doesn't
necessarily mean buying.

343
00:18:59,892 --> 00:19:01,721
No, of course it doesn't.

344
00:19:02,735 --> 00:19:06,629
I just want you to give it
some serious consideration.

345
00:19:08,121 --> 00:19:11,259
You can count on that.
Especially after last night.

346
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,524
I think that, uh, you deserve...

347
00:19:13,525 --> 00:19:15,987
I'm sorry, that was
you last night, right?

348
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,430
With the mask and the strange headgear?

349
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:22,357
Code blue.

350
00:19:23,577 --> 00:19:24,886
Code blue.

351
00:19:28,108 --> 00:19:30,748
Hang in there, Devon. You're
going to be okay. Got the pulse ox.

352
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:34,753
- What do we have?
- Blood pressure 80/40. Heart 150.

353
00:19:34,754 --> 00:19:36,648
- Don't need that drug panel now.
- Where's the crash cart?

354
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:38,987
- Coming in.
- Carly and I have him.

355
00:19:39,002 --> 00:19:41,314
Annie, two milligram Naloxone I.V. push.

356
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:43,384
Got it. Two milligrams I.V. push.

357
00:19:43,385 --> 00:19:44,912
Lungs are clear.

358
00:19:45,465 --> 00:19:47,815
Pupils are pinpoint and un-reactive.

359
00:19:47,816 --> 00:19:50,943
B.P. 75/35, Heart rate 160.

360
00:19:50,944 --> 00:19:52,446
<i>EKG leads.</i>

361
00:19:54,074 --> 00:19:56,037
<i>Okay, lift him on three.</i>

362
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:58,949
<i>B.P. 65/35. Heart rate's 175.</i>

363
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:05,978
EKG leads in place. He's in V-tach.

364
00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:07,606
How'd he go sour so fast?

365
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:10,351
He flew in from Caracas three hours ago.

366
00:20:10,352 --> 00:20:12,740
He's probably body-packing
heroin. The bags must have burst.

367
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:14,532
We've got V-fib. He's
stopped breathing.

368
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:15,740
Damn.

369
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:17,936
Start bagging him. Charge to 360.

370
00:20:17,937 --> 00:20:20,158
Still in V-fib. Should
I give him an amp of epi?

371
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,037
Not till we shock him.

372
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:28,789
Still in V-fib. No pressure, no pulse.

373
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,802
I'm sorry, Ms. Watson.

374
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,335
- Me, too.
- Where's he taking him?

375
00:20:58,383 --> 00:20:59,567
Hospital morgue.

376
00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:02,334
We pick him up there?

377
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,390
No, you do not pick him up there.

378
00:21:07,386 --> 00:21:08,662
Sign it, Bernie.

379
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,309
How's Carly?

380
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,297
Not bad considering she
saw the Angel of Death.

381
00:21:17,237 --> 00:21:19,050
What did this one look like?

382
00:21:19,051 --> 00:21:20,527
Shirley Temple.

383
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:23,720
I don't like losing patients.

384
00:21:24,127 --> 00:21:26,949
If your brother had told us
he was body-packing drugs,

385
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,641
we might have saved him.

386
00:21:30,951 --> 00:21:32,245
Or if you had told us.

387
00:21:34,132 --> 00:21:36,558
I don't know what's in Dee's gut, Doc.

388
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:40,661
And neither do you.

389
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,383
Now...

390
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,180
where do we pick up his body?

391
00:21:46,462 --> 00:21:49,860
City morgue after he's been autopsied.

392
00:21:50,246 --> 00:21:51,992
We don't need an autopsy.

393
00:21:52,814 --> 00:21:53,886
I do.

394
00:21:58,263 --> 00:22:00,113
Come on, we got to get out of here.

395
00:22:03,764 --> 00:22:05,165
Suck it up, Bernie!

396
00:22:05,451 --> 00:22:07,199
You got to get me somethin', Nick.

397
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,964
I'm gettin' too shaky to walk.

398
00:22:08,965 --> 00:22:11,459
Pharmacy downstairs. I'll
get cough syrup with codeine.

399
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,263
That ain't gonna help much.

400
00:22:13,264 --> 00:22:14,900
Never pimp a junkie.

401
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:17,974
- I ain't a junkie!
- Then walk out of here!

402
00:22:25,131 --> 00:22:28,185
He knew Devon was
body-packing and said nothing.

403
00:22:28,186 --> 00:22:30,233
Well, he didn't want
to lose his shipment.

404
00:22:31,122 --> 00:22:32,868
That makes him an accessory.

405
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:35,258
Yeah? How could you prove that, Jeanne?

406
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:37,455
I don't know, but I can't
just let him walk out of here.

407
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:40,344
Dr. Benoit, you don't
want to get involved.

408
00:22:40,345 --> 00:22:42,764
I am involved, Annie. That
boy didn't have to die.

409
00:22:42,765 --> 00:22:45,043
No, but that is not your fault.

410
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:47,910
Jeanne, the coroner's
going to do an autopsy.

411
00:22:47,911 --> 00:22:50,914
He's going to find the
drugs, notify narcotics.

412
00:22:50,915 --> 00:22:52,703
What more can you do than that?

413
00:22:55,617 --> 00:22:56,691
I don't know.

414
00:23:01,475 --> 00:23:02,952
I feel so damn helpless!

415
00:23:05,403 --> 00:23:08,267
They're all like that the first
year. At least the good ones.

416
00:23:08,268 --> 00:23:10,620
It takes a little while to get calluses.

417
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,368
I don't know if Jeanne ever will, Annie.

418
00:23:15,621 --> 00:23:16,847
Love.

419
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,819
- You pushed the wrong button!
- Sorry.

420
00:23:29,122 --> 00:23:31,002
What are you doing down here?

421
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:33,234
Pushed the wrong button.

422
00:23:36,158 --> 00:23:38,323
- Morgue down here?
- Why?

423
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,250
Bernie might want to take
a last look at her brother.

424
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:44,231
Morgue's closed.

425
00:23:45,271 --> 00:23:47,524
There's no one down here, anyway.

426
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:49,503
Her brother's here.

427
00:23:50,678 --> 00:23:52,358
I don't think that's funny.

428
00:24:00,987 --> 00:24:02,378
Hey, boss, what's up?

429
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:04,224
There's a letter on your desk.

430
00:24:04,461 --> 00:24:05,636
Sign it.

431
00:24:13,773 --> 00:24:16,088
- What is it?
- Just sign it, Tim.

432
00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:23,181
It's a get out of jail free card.

433
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,395
Boss, why would I need such a card?

434
00:24:36,396 --> 00:24:40,056
Because you're going
to hack into the CIA.

435
00:24:45,781 --> 00:24:48,563
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

436
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:53,584
Okay, I know you guys have
been working really hard lately,

437
00:24:53,585 --> 00:24:56,333
and I promised that you
could have the weekend off,

438
00:24:56,334 --> 00:24:58,654
but this sounds like an emergency,

439
00:24:58,655 --> 00:25:02,128
so I need everybody to get
those electrons flowing!

440
00:25:02,581 --> 00:25:05,434
If anybody is not up to
it, I need to know now,

441
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:08,254
not when the Director arrives.

442
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:10,167
Something's wrong.

443
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:28,302
Ready.

444
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,912
Thanks for coming in on
such short notice, Abby.

445
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:37,891
Neither rain, nor snow,
nor sleet, nor hail

446
00:25:37,892 --> 00:25:40,813
will keep this scientist
from her appointed rounds.

447
00:25:40,814 --> 00:25:41,837
Nice.

448
00:25:41,838 --> 00:25:44,779
You've adopted what the
post office has forgotten.

449
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:47,418
Did you climb the Eiffel Tower?

450
00:25:47,972 --> 00:25:49,096
No.

451
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:50,678
No?

452
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:54,215
How can you be in Paris and
not climb the Eiffel Tower?!

453
00:25:57,967 --> 00:26:00,912
I want to know whose
fingerprints are on these.

454
00:26:01,482 --> 00:26:03,649
Chain of evidence is not important.

455
00:26:05,326 --> 00:26:07,172
I'll be in my office.

456
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:18,215
Boss, you were right.

457
00:26:18,216 --> 00:26:21,531
The order to polygraph came
from Homeland Security's

458
00:26:21,532 --> 00:26:24,410
Assistant Director for
Infrastructure Protection.

459
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,216
But it didn't originate from there.

460
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:30,446
I traced into his IMAP account using
an encryption algorithm developed...

461
00:26:30,671 --> 00:26:32,662
You're not really interested
in how I did this, are you?

462
00:26:32,663 --> 00:26:34,089
Nope, I'm not.

463
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:38,939
Okay, well, the order went from Homeland
Security to China, then Kurdistan.

464
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,840
It went through a secondary server
in India to the island of Cypress.

465
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:43,961
Then through Puerto Rico.

466
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:47,368
Where it followed a bank
line back to D.C. and...

467
00:26:47,369 --> 00:26:48,442
CIA.

468
00:26:48,443 --> 00:26:50,780
Specifically, their
National Clandestine Service.

469
00:26:50,781 --> 00:26:54,023
It went in and out of a maze of
incoming and outgoing Black Op chatter.

470
00:26:54,024 --> 00:26:56,322
All encrypted. That's where I lost it.

471
00:26:57,846 --> 00:26:59,260
But I found it again.

472
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,555
It's part of a Black Op.

473
00:27:01,556 --> 00:27:03,050
It's code-named Lodestone.

474
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:07,750
Running out of the CIA section for
Weapons Control and Arms Proliferation.

475
00:27:08,287 --> 00:27:10,251
The Frog.

476
00:27:25,121 --> 00:27:27,665
Who do I have to thank for this?

477
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:30,811
A former FBI agent.

478
00:27:31,314 --> 00:27:33,408
You're very resourceful, Kort.

479
00:27:33,643 --> 00:27:34,767
I try.

480
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,202
So you've recorded their conversations?

481
00:27:37,402 --> 00:27:38,407
No.

482
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:39,638
No? Why?

483
00:27:40,142 --> 00:27:43,062
You didn't want to
intrude on their privacy?

484
00:27:44,182 --> 00:27:46,465
I didn't think it was necessary.

485
00:27:46,851 --> 00:27:48,277
No? Why was that?

486
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:51,718
I only needed photos for leverage.

487
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:55,273
- This DiNozzo is married?
- No.

488
00:27:55,845 --> 00:27:58,256
Then how did you
intend to gain leverage?

489
00:28:02,572 --> 00:28:04,435
You intend to harm her?

490
00:28:05,257 --> 00:28:06,399
Only threaten.

491
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:12,017
He loves her?

492
00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:13,897
DiNozzo...

493
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,760
he's a player.

494
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:19,258
Never with a skirt
more than a few weeks.

495
00:28:20,517 --> 00:28:21,994
That's too bad.

496
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:25,066
A man in love could be persuaded...

497
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:28,268
to do almost anything.

498
00:28:28,637 --> 00:28:30,265
DiNozzo's a white hat.

499
00:28:30,651 --> 00:28:32,766
He won't want to see her harmed.

500
00:28:33,851 --> 00:28:35,820
Have you not noticed, Kort?

501
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:41,328
I like white hats.

502
00:28:44,786 --> 00:28:47,001
<i>Shirley Temple looked
through the door...</i>

503
00:28:47,002 --> 00:28:49,756
Shirley Temple? I didn't
say Shirley Temple.

504
00:28:50,412 --> 00:28:51,636
Who is Shirley Temple?

505
00:28:52,223 --> 00:28:54,858
A child star from the 1930s
with curly blonde hair.

506
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:55,949
Well, you saw him.

507
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,484
If you say he looked like Shirley
Temple, he looked like Shirley Temple.

508
00:28:58,485 --> 00:29:00,216
I didn't see him, Carly.

509
00:29:00,217 --> 00:29:02,952
The Angel was standing right behind you.

510
00:29:02,953 --> 00:29:04,459
Your Angel of Death...

511
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,340
wandered away from her mother in ICU.

512
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:10,153
They flew in from Paris to see
their grandfather who stroked.

513
00:29:10,154 --> 00:29:12,520
Security's been searching
the hospital for an hour.

514
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:17,211
If you see the Angel of Death
again, her name is Sarah.

515
00:29:17,295 --> 00:29:19,409
It's just a lost little girl, Carly.

516
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,956
If you say so, Doctor.

517
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:26,414
All right, well, I will
see you in the morning.

518
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:29,172
- I gotta go.
- I'll be out at 7:00.

519
00:29:30,095 --> 00:29:32,596
And if you see a hooded skeleton, duck.

520
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:34,992
Dr. Benoit.

521
00:29:35,432 --> 00:29:38,264
That addict and her pimp were down in
the basement asking about the morgue.

522
00:29:38,265 --> 00:29:39,413
You didn't let them stay there?

523
00:29:39,414 --> 00:29:41,692
Of course not. I made them return
with me to the ground floor.

524
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:42,901
They leave the hospital?

525
00:29:42,902 --> 00:29:44,093
They went into the pharmacy.

526
00:29:44,094 --> 00:29:45,550
I had to return the gurney to the ER,

527
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:47,852
but I got a feeling
they're going to try again.

528
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:48,958
Thanks, Bill.

529
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:52,435
Annie, call Security. Ask
them to meet me in the morgue.

530
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,317
Miss me already?

531
00:29:58,616 --> 00:30:01,204
Our grieving couple
may be in the morgue.

532
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:04,795
Damn.

533
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,581
They never make it easy.

534
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:18,902
He's not in the cabinet, Bernie.

535
00:30:19,372 --> 00:30:22,309
I drank the cough syrup
and it ain't doing nothing.

536
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,886
No drugs in a morgue, dummy.

537
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:26,317
You want a fix... find your brother.

538
00:30:32,649 --> 00:30:33,858
Nick.

539
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,235
Hi ya, Dee.

540
00:30:46,521 --> 00:30:47,856
Hey!

541
00:30:49,296 --> 00:30:50,296
Jeanne.

542
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:04,707
He's still warm.

543
00:31:08,315 --> 00:31:11,509
That's 'cause he hasn't had
time to cool. Have you, Dee?

544
00:31:13,557 --> 00:31:14,950
Jeanne, slow down.

545
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:17,931
Is it...?

546
00:31:17,932 --> 00:31:19,743
Jeanne, hey.

547
00:31:20,014 --> 00:31:22,618
You trying to get yourself killed?
He's at least got a knife in there.

548
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:24,967
I will not let him butcher
her brother in front of her.

549
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:26,060
Keep your voice down.

550
00:31:26,061 --> 00:31:28,333
Those drugs are in
25 feet of intestines.

551
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:30,324
He doesn't know where to cut.

552
00:31:30,325 --> 00:31:32,421
He'll make a gory mess she'll
never get out of her head.

553
00:31:32,422 --> 00:31:33,982
Get behind me.

554
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:36,936
- Why?
- Because I tell you to.

555
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:46,250
Haven't got a weapon on
you by any chance, have you?

556
00:31:59,523 --> 00:32:01,537
I have a funny feeling, Doctor.

557
00:32:01,994 --> 00:32:03,679
It's the tequila, my dear.

558
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,091
You've had three shooters just
in the time I've been here.

559
00:32:07,256 --> 00:32:10,831
Straight to voice mail. Just
like always when he's with her.

560
00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:13,747
- Tony?
- What?

561
00:32:15,431 --> 00:32:16,431
Nothing.

562
00:32:16,432 --> 00:32:17,619
Oh, no, no, no.

563
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,728
That look was definitely something.

564
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,054
Well, why do you monitor Tony?

565
00:32:22,055 --> 00:32:23,618
I don't monitor Tony.

566
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:27,081
Oh, yes, you do, my dear,
like a mother with her toddler.

567
00:32:28,018 --> 00:32:30,183
That's a good description.

568
00:32:30,555 --> 00:32:33,809
Or a woman with a wayward lover.

569
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:35,342
Ducky...

570
00:32:35,845 --> 00:32:38,363
do not profile me... I'm not a killer.

571
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:43,369
Correction... I have killed
before, but never feloniously.

572
00:32:43,688 --> 00:32:45,584
Ziva, it's Friday night.

573
00:32:47,546 --> 00:32:51,158
Tony is with his girlfriend
and you are worried about him.

574
00:32:53,057 --> 00:32:54,595
What does that tell you?

575
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,374
He is my partner.

576
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,985
And my partner said he would be here.

577
00:32:59,147 --> 00:33:00,356
And...

578
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,000
and I have this...

579
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:07,769
not so good feeling.

580
00:33:17,373 --> 00:33:18,667
I didn't find nothing.

581
00:33:18,668 --> 00:33:21,620
The way you're shaking,
you couldn't find a shotgun.

582
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:23,499
Let's see...

583
00:33:34,592 --> 00:33:36,623
You called Security, Doc?

584
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,298
Of course you did. Call 'em off.

585
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,512
I said call 'em off.

586
00:33:43,513 --> 00:33:46,689
You haven't done anything
that can't be forgotten.

587
00:33:47,812 --> 00:33:50,485
- Do what he says, Jeanne.
- Why?

588
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:53,842
They can leave now, and we'll
forget this ever happened.

589
00:33:54,748 --> 00:33:56,379
Would you do that?

590
00:33:57,538 --> 00:33:58,746
Yes.

591
00:34:01,213 --> 00:34:02,489
Tony...

592
00:34:06,763 --> 00:34:08,274
Will you forget now?

593
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:12,537
That's what I thought.

594
00:34:13,091 --> 00:34:15,239
Call off Security.

595
00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:29,297
Put it on the speaker.

596
00:34:32,993 --> 00:34:34,504
Security. Jackson.

597
00:34:35,057 --> 00:34:37,205
This is Dr. Benoit in the morgue.

598
00:34:37,206 --> 00:34:39,563
<i>Oh, sorry, Doctor. I'll
have a man there in a minute.</i>

599
00:34:39,564 --> 00:34:41,695
<i>We're just stretched thin
looking for that little girl.</i>

600
00:34:41,696 --> 00:34:43,375
You can recall him.

601
00:34:43,593 --> 00:34:44,902
It was a false alarm.

602
00:34:44,903 --> 00:34:48,082
<i>Okay. Can I have your
hospital I.D. number please?</i>

603
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:51,180
766.

604
00:34:52,321 --> 00:34:54,234
<i>Thank you, Dr. Benoit.</i>

605
00:34:57,317 --> 00:34:59,034
Is a little girl lost?

606
00:35:00,317 --> 00:35:01,996
More than one.

607
00:35:04,413 --> 00:35:06,058
Surgery first, Doc.

608
00:35:07,216 --> 00:35:08,239
No.

609
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:09,750
No?

610
00:35:09,751 --> 00:35:11,344
I help him first.

611
00:35:13,552 --> 00:35:15,297
You're a slow learner, Doc.

612
00:35:15,298 --> 00:35:17,463
I called off Security.

613
00:35:18,134 --> 00:35:20,281
I help him, then...

614
00:35:20,282 --> 00:35:22,044
I help you.

615
00:35:22,632 --> 00:35:26,894
If that's not good enough, shoot me.

616
00:35:29,008 --> 00:35:30,804
Don't hurt her, Nick.

617
00:35:39,201 --> 00:35:41,450
Tony? Tony?

618
00:35:41,601 --> 00:35:42,809
Can you sit up?

619
00:35:43,212 --> 00:35:45,196
No, I'm up.

620
00:35:47,696 --> 00:35:49,198
Someone is looking at me.

621
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,583
- It's the cleaning crew.
- No, on the computer.

622
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:54,850
I got to shut down my UPD port.

623
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,568
I don't think it penetrated my firewall.

624
00:35:59,569 --> 00:36:01,978
- What the hell is it?
- It's a botagent.

625
00:36:01,979 --> 00:36:03,757
It's probably one of the CIA's.

626
00:36:03,758 --> 00:36:05,757
Botagent... short for robotic agent.

627
00:36:05,758 --> 00:36:08,719
Designed to crawl the Internet
looking for snoopers like us.

628
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,508
- This for real?
- Oh, yeah, boss.

629
00:36:10,509 --> 00:36:13,857
If this had penetrated my firewall,
it could have downloaded my hard drive.

630
00:36:13,858 --> 00:36:16,525
The CIA would have all our data,
and know we were onto Lodestone.

631
00:36:16,526 --> 00:36:18,910
- Can you kill it?
- No, though I could build

632
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:22,502
a mirror to my firewall, so that when
it looks in, it could just see itself.

633
00:36:22,503 --> 00:36:25,374
- How long?
- Too long.

634
00:36:26,247 --> 00:36:28,453
Or I could use another computer.

635
00:36:29,736 --> 00:36:31,070
Boss, just one thing...

636
00:36:31,071 --> 00:36:34,013
There's always just one thing, McGee.

637
00:36:34,014 --> 00:36:37,234
A really smart botagent
won't just sit on my computer.

638
00:36:37,235 --> 00:36:40,188
It'll look for my search
patterns on the Internet.

639
00:36:40,189 --> 00:36:42,618
This is like tracking a dirtbag, McGee.

640
00:36:42,636 --> 00:36:45,849
You stake out his house.
You put out a BOLO.

641
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,049
Keep tabs on the girl.

642
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:50,499
Never thought of it that way.

643
00:36:50,717 --> 00:36:52,134
Start a new search.

644
00:36:52,362 --> 00:36:53,453
Okay.

645
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:56,105
- What am I looking for?
- The girlfriend...

646
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,548
Jenny Shepard.

647
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,582
When you look at me like that, McGee,

648
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:06,291
I get this overwhelming
urge to head slap you.

649
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,775
I am going to get...

650
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,984
a ding...

651
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:26,141
now!

652
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,895
You guys are doing this
because it's the weekend.

653
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:35,392
And you think if you just
stall, then I'll give up

654
00:37:35,393 --> 00:37:40,012
and I'll finish the search on Monday,
but that is not going to happen.

655
00:37:40,694 --> 00:37:41,734
Abby...

656
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,614
you worry me.

657
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:48,263
Oh, they know I'm just, you know,
talking to them to pass the time.

658
00:37:48,264 --> 00:37:52,138
Because at this point, the fingerprint
match is totally up to AFIS.

659
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,677
Right, guys?

660
00:37:54,046 --> 00:37:55,338
Right, guys?

661
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:57,386
I'm just joshing you, Director.

662
00:37:57,387 --> 00:37:59,366
I spoiled your Friday night.

663
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:03,405
Oh, you know, I was
just hanging at the bar.

664
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,763
And I probably would have been completely
passed out by now if I'd stayed.

665
00:38:06,764 --> 00:38:08,256
Joshing me again?

666
00:38:08,575 --> 00:38:09,633
No.

667
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:11,892
Yes.

668
00:38:14,232 --> 00:38:16,724
- How many prints?
- Two sets.

669
00:38:17,009 --> 00:38:20,598
He poured with his left hand and
held the glass with his right.

670
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:22,911
Left-handed? Or ambidextrous.

671
00:38:22,912 --> 00:38:25,010
I can pour with either hand.

672
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,789
I can tell you he's not military.

673
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:30,062
AFIS would have gotten a match
on anyone on active duty by now.

674
00:38:30,063 --> 00:38:31,455
What if he was retired?

675
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:32,829
Covered them, too.

676
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,309
Dead?

677
00:38:34,707 --> 00:38:36,105
Dead?

678
00:38:36,455 --> 00:38:38,186
You said this wasn't a case.

679
00:38:38,455 --> 00:38:39,797
It's not.

680
00:38:39,999 --> 00:38:45,353
I want you to expand the search to
include servicemen alive prior to '95.

681
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,577
Okay.

682
00:38:54,612 --> 00:38:56,518
I don't see any signs of concussion.

683
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:58,519
I've been hit harder by my sister.

684
00:38:59,267 --> 00:39:00,454
You don't have a sister.

685
00:39:00,455 --> 00:39:01,740
I don't?

686
00:39:02,327 --> 00:39:03,899
Nick...

687
00:39:04,923 --> 00:39:06,869
Enough playing, Doctor.

688
00:39:09,294 --> 00:39:11,206
Do it. I don't want you to get hurt.

689
00:39:11,207 --> 00:39:12,265
Let's go.

690
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:24,332
Half K of pure horse in here, Doc.

691
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:25,808
I'm no surgeon.

692
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:28,121
I'm not asking you to save a life, Doc.

693
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,637
Maybe I am.

694
00:39:30,638 --> 00:39:32,467
Come on, come on, come on!

695
00:39:32,468 --> 00:39:34,497
Quit stalling. He doesn't have AIDS.

696
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:36,824
That's not what the mask's for.

697
00:39:37,226 --> 00:39:38,955
What's it for?

698
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,663
Turn around, Bernie.

699
00:39:42,273 --> 00:39:43,442
Please hurry.

700
00:39:44,211 --> 00:39:45,894
Why the mask?

701
00:39:45,895 --> 00:39:48,509
Tell her to turn around.

702
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,667
Do it, Bernie.

703
00:39:51,261 --> 00:39:53,443
The mask is to protect
me from disease spread

704
00:39:53,444 --> 00:39:56,430
by airborne particles
released when I open him up.

705
00:40:05,646 --> 00:40:06,977
No more stalling.

706
00:40:23,996 --> 00:40:25,893
Devon died bringing this to you.

707
00:40:26,564 --> 00:40:27,655
Want it?

708
00:40:27,656 --> 00:40:29,488
What the hell do you think?

709
00:40:35,154 --> 00:40:36,245
Bitch!

710
00:40:42,531 --> 00:40:45,115
Next one's in your ear.

711
00:40:47,065 --> 00:40:48,463
Drop it.

712
00:40:52,403 --> 00:40:53,403
You okay?

713
00:40:55,113 --> 00:40:56,187
Not really.

714
00:41:01,715 --> 00:41:02,850
Oh, God.

715
00:41:28,138 --> 00:41:29,245
Who's this?

716
00:41:30,085 --> 00:41:33,592
It's uh, Director's father...
Colonel Jasper Shepard.

717
00:41:35,588 --> 00:41:36,894
You don't know him?

718
00:41:38,277 --> 00:41:39,965
She never talked family.

719
00:41:39,966 --> 00:41:41,462
It's like you.

720
00:41:44,659 --> 00:41:46,304
She has his eyes.

721
00:41:46,718 --> 00:41:48,016
He still alive?

722
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,530
Deceased.

723
00:41:55,403 --> 00:41:56,697
Suicide,

724
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:58,367
12 years ago.

725
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:22,656
- There she goes.
- Who?

726
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:24,031
Sarah.

727
00:42:24,032 --> 00:42:26,914
Security found her sleeping
in the delivery room.

728
00:42:36,657 --> 00:42:39,835
You should be under
observation for 24 hours.

729
00:42:40,338 --> 00:42:42,167
Whatever doctor orders.

730
00:42:46,094 --> 00:42:47,094
What's this?

731
00:42:48,478 --> 00:42:49,846
My secret.

732
00:42:53,328 --> 00:42:54,910
<i>Bonjour, Papa.</i>

733
00:42:56,299 --> 00:42:57,675
<i>Bonjour, ma fille.</i>

734
00:43:00,713 --> 00:43:03,063
So this must be Anthony DiNardo.

735
00:43:07,074 --> 00:43:08,822
Welcome to the family,

736
00:43:09,326 --> 00:43:10,970
Professeur.
