00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,050
Welcome home,director.

00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,280
- How was the interpol conference?
- Fine.

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,620
Full of euro cops trying to hook up with me.

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,330
And,no,i didn't.

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,910
- Oh,i wasn't wondering if...
- I would if i were you.Now,get in,cynthia.

6
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,790
Is the agency still intact after
a week with gibbs in charge?

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,740
Mmm,we survived.

8
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,470
- Did gibbs?
- Barely.

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,580

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,580
- You hungry,sera?
- No,i ate on the plane.

15
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,150
I fix your favorite paella.

16
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,630
- Very well.I'll have a little.
- Okay.

17
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,880
- Will there be anything else,director?
- No.

18
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,430
Uh,take cynthia home.

19
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,510
She's going to argue,but it's silly for
her to go back to the office now.

20
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,240
Understood.

21
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,240
What te tomorrow,director?

22
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,710

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,130
Yes,ma'am.

24
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,650
- Noemi,i'll eat in the study.
- Si,sera

25
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,260
My father has been dead sce '95.

26
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,510
He stood where you stand a mere three weeks ago.

27
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,450
- Noemi!
- Si,sera?

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,160
Who's been in my study?

29
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,190
No one,sera.

30
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,000
Obviously someone.

31
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,410
You no do that?

32
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,770
I no do that.

33
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,270
Maybe before you leave?

34
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,810
I've been gone for five days.
Didn't you clean in here?

35
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,720
Si,sera.

36
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,980
I...I no see.

37
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,210
I'm sorry,sera.

38
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,130
It's nothing,noemi.Don't worry about it.

39
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,550
Okay,i know this looks a little weird

40
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,200
but i couldn't get my hands on a real
polygraph machine

41
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,140
So..so i made one.

42
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,690
Um,name.

43
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,910
Name!Tell me your name!

44
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,920
Stop acting like a nazi.Come over here.
Scratch my nose,please.

45
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,690
Right side,right side.

46
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,610
God,not shard!

47
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,370
Mcgee,stop being such aaby.Name.

48
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,120
Timothy mcgee-- no middle initial.

49
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,540
Have you ever used an alias?

50
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,610
Does a nom de plume count?

51
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,740
- It does.
- Thome.Gemcity.

52
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,830
Any other names?

53
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,060
No.

54
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,820
- No?
- No.

55
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,070
Okay,either you or my polygraph is lying.

56
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,140
- And since this is a machine and it can't lie...
- Hal lied through his chips.

57
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,900
I thght the expression was
"to lie through your teeth.

58
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,000
Hal,the computer.2001?Sci-fi classic?

59
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,140
How can a six-year-old movie be a classic?

60
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,490
The film that was made in 1968.

61
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,530
2001: a space odyssey directed by stanley kubrick.

62
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,190
- How long do you have to be in this country...
- Guys...

63
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,880
I'm trying to prep mcgee
fohis polygraph on monday.

64
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,090
Really?Well,unless you're a spy,mcgeek--

65
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,770
The thought of which is utterly licrous--
what's the sweat?

66
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,340
He panics taking tests.

67
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,350
It's not uncommon started in kindergarten.

68
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,960
- Couldn't change his answer.
- Hard to erase crayon.

69
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,330
Tony,it's not funny.

70
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,270
Retaining my special agent status is
dependent on passing this polygraph.

71
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,670
Oh,this is definitely a lie.

72
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,080
- What'd you ask him?
- His name.

73
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,730
- You lied about your name?
- No.

74
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,580
Timothy mcgee is myegal name.

75
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,950
Thom e.Gemcity is my pen name.
I don't have any other names.

76
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,670
- Probie.
- Yeah,boss.

77
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,410
And elf lord.Two other names.

78
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,730
Why are you torturing mcgee?

79
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,510
I am not torturing,mcgee.

80
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,960
I am prepping him.
He has his cps polygraph on monday.

81
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,300
- Who ordered that?
- Homeland security.

82
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,960
All ncis agents must take it-- directors included.

83
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,120
Check your e-mails.

84
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,880
Duh...Monday,0900.

85
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,850
Tuesday,1300.

86
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,100
Boss,what time is your...

87
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,570
You ever seen the angel of death,dr.Benoit?

88
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,490
Skeleton,oded black robe,scythe.

89
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,890
- I am not kidding,doctor.
- Carly.

90
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,290
Not a skeleton with a grass-cutter.
That's r kids on halloween.

91
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,230
Although,if he wanted to
he could appear as a skeleton.

92
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,340
I take it you've seen him?

93
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,400
Once,when my uncle luis died.

94
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,350
- What did he look like?
- Miss puerto rico.

95
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,960
What are you talking about?You can't keep me here.

96
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,940
You want to walk,walk.

97
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,430
I can't with this leg iron on.

98
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,660
- I want a cast.
- After surgery.

99
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,820
Wait a minute...

100
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,070
Wait a minute,are they...
Are they going to knock me out?

101
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,370
Oh,i hope not.

102
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,900
Where's my backpack?

103
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,580
Where's my bag?I want my backpack.

104
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,770
Sorry to stick you with this one,doctor.

105
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,130
No problem,annie.

106
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,900
Dr.jessup wants him in monkey bars
till he can operate.

107
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,990
Three mgs of versed,
two of morphine,15 minutes ago.

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,230
And he's still amped up?

109
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,810
I think the boy had more on board
than er put in him.

110
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,970
Patti said he wouldn't let them take blood.

111
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,610
And it was a fight ju to get the leg x-rayed.

112
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,650
Hey,where's my pne?Someone stole my phone!

113
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,720
- You didn't come in with one,devon.
- No,i had a cell phone!

114
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,260
- I was texting on it when...
- When you stepped in front of a cab at dulles.

115
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,980
I'm Dr.Benoit,devon.Give me a minute.

116
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,810
You're hertensive and tachycardiac.

117
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,620
What's that?

118
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,760
Not good.

119
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,490
Have y taken drugs we don't know about?

120
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,010
We're not the police,devon.

121
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,380
Our only concern is your well-being.

122
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:08,080
I want...I want to call my sister.

123
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,940
There's a phone in your room.

124
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,930
What do you think,doctor?

125
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,210
Keep your eye out for miss puerto rico.

126
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,780
Visiting our ex-wife?

127
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,320
Waiting for you.

128
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,050
- How'd you know i'd be here?
- Friday night.Odd weekend.

129
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,730
Hold on,emily.

130
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,390
- Hi,daddy!
- Hey,em.

131
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,790
Be there in a minute.

132
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,850
Diane look that pissed at you after the divorce?

133
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,060
She's looking at me,tobias.

134
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,750
Ever think of picking up a phone?

135
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,490
Hard lines are tapped.
Cell calls snatched right out of the air.

136
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,840
Turning into a conspiracy nut,jethro.What's next?

137
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,880
- Alien abductions?
- Only if you don't answer my question.

138
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,790
- Why the polygraphs?
- No.

139
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,690
Do you still dream about o.j.-ing diane?

140
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,100
Nah,emily kind of likes her.You?

141
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,040
Only when i think about
my grandfather's railroad watch.

142
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,390
Beautiful chimes.

143
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,410
- Fbi being polygraphed?
- No.

144
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,160
And before you run through the alphabet soup.

145
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,890
This net is beg cast strictly over ncis.

146
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,610
Who's doing the fishing?

147
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,180
Obviously,someone who
thinks there's a security risk at ncis.

148
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,420
CIA.Who are they after,tobias?

149
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,040
Your boss.

150
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,330
Ser gibbs.

151
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,660
- Director home?
- I'm in here.

152
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,830
In polite society,one usually calls
before a visit.Bourbon?

153
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,120
Kicked in too many doors to be polite.Yeah.

154
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,120
I appreciate the restraint you
showed by using the bell.

155
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,780
I've been rather fond of that door
since i was a child.

156
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,330
You could have waited to report
till monday,jethro.

157
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,730
That's not why i'm here.
You lost your protection detail in paris.

158
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,110
You went msing for 21 hours.Where were you?

159
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,890
- You sound like a jealous husband.
- How would you know?

160
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,600
Do you want this or not?

161
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,930
Don't...Touch that!

162
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,160
It's scotch.

163
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,500
You drink bourbon.

164
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,730
So do you.

165
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:27,430
I had another visitor before you arrived...

166
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,490
Unannounced.

167
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,110
Did he duck out the back?

168
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,660
Now you do sound like a jealous husband.

169
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,900
You go off grid for 21 hours...

170
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,510
And we're being polygraphed for a security breach.

171
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,690
Drink your bourbon and say good night,gracie.

172
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,610
What were you doing for 21 hours,jenny?

173
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,680
What we used to do.

174
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,130
Ever so well.

175
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,080
When you lie,your right eye twitches.

176
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,450
It always has.

177
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,630
You know,constitutionally,
you can refuse to take a polygraph.

178
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,350
I'd have to turn in my badge.

179
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,710
True,but you don't have to take the test.

180
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,430
Hey,i have an idea.

181
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,940
Why don't we get ducky to tell the examiners that
tim is just way too stressed to take the test?

182
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,500
Ducky's a medil examiner,he's not a psychiatrist.

183
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,970
- But he does psychological profiles.
- Of serial killers.

184
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,780
That's good i'll go from federal
ant to serial killer in one day.

185
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,720
It was just a thought.

186
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,970
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

187
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,600
Wow.Great bartender.

188
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,250
- U can beat a polygraph.
- No,you can't.

189
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,600
I've done it,abby.It's part of mossad training.

190
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,940
- All you have to do...
- Oh,hello!If it's unethical,i can't hear it!

191
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,090
- Well,don't listen.
- Fine.

192
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,630
- La-la-la-la-la.Go ahead...
- May we join you?

193
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,210
- Hey,ducky,here take my chair.
- No,no,no,no,timothy.

194
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,690
- At a bar,i prefer to stand.
- Me,too.

195
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,920
Macallan neat.Mineral water on the side.No ice.

196
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,330
Uh...I'll take a,uh,chocolate martini.

197
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,620
Just kidding.Uh,make that a green fairy mojito.

198
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,640
You got it.

199
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:16,810
Why is everybody so dour?
It's tgif and the happy hour!

200
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,200
Homeland security's ordering us
to take a polygraph.

201
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,890
That's ther odd.But there's nothing
to worry about.

202
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,400
Unless...You're a spy.

203
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,310
Why are you looking at me?

204
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,490
I'm trying to lighten the atmosphere
with a littlhumor.

205
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,450
I don't think they expect you to be funny,doctor.

206
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,990
- That didn't come out right.
- No,i should say not.

207
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,510
I mean i don't think
they expect a scotsman to be funny.

208
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,930
Stop digging,jimmy.You've almost reached china.

209
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,460
Yeah,a round for my friends on me.

210
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,610
Dispelling two misconceptions about
scotsmen in one night.

211
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,120
Does anyone know where the rest rooms are?

212
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,210
- I do!
- Okay.

213
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,330
Uh,one moment!First...A toast!

214
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,050
- Please,god,make it quick.
- Amen.

215
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,100
May the best you've ever seen be
the worst you'll ever see.

216
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:02,680
May a mouse never leave your girnal
th a teardrop in his eye.

217
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,380
May you stay hale and hearty
until you're old enough to die.

218
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,250
May you always be as happy
as we wish you all to be.

219
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,240
- Guys,i'm sorry i gotta go.
- Uh,me,too.

220
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,140
Oh,um...

221
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,090
- Great toast,ducky.
- Thank you.

222
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,150
- Terrific.
- Really good,doctor.

223
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,900
May a mouse never leave your girdle
with a teardrop in his e.

224
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,710
Not girdle,girnal.

225
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,640
It's an oat bin if it was empty,a mouse would cry.

226
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,350
To dry-eyed mice.

227
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,510
Here,here.

228
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,190
Stupid bastard.

229
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,100
I don't think that dee meant to get hit by a...

230
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,730
- Why didn't you push it?
- It was lit.

231
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,340
I'have pushed it anyway.

232
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,730
- And why is that?
- To watch it light .

233
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,010
Why don't you get her some help?Er's on one.

234
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,020
You talking to me?

235
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,570
Yeah,i'm talkg to you,bobby.

236
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,120
- His name is nick.
- Shut up,bernie.

237
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,890
But he thinks that your name is bobby.

238
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,190
- Don't you?
- No.

239
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,450
He thinks his name is bobby.Don't you?

240
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,220
You don't think your name is bobby,do you,nick?

241
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,570
Shut up.Can't you see he's a cop?

242
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:48,140
Hey,er said devon watson was up here.

243
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,710
- He called his sister to pick him up.
- I'm his sister.

244
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,660
He hasn't gone into surgery.

245
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,910
Surgery?For a broken leg?

246
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,030
It's a severe compound fracture.

247
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,380
Put a splint on it.

248
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,040
- Is there a problem here,car?
- I don't know.

249
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,300
Do we have a problem?

250
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,720
No problem.My girl's worried about
her brother,that's all.

251
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,060
- Wants to see him.
- Yeah,can i see dee?

252
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,380
That's up to dr.Benoit

253
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,630
- I need this stat.
- Sure.

254
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,030
This is mr.Watson's sist,dr.Benoit.

255
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,210
Bernette.But everybody calls me bernie.

256
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,320
- And you are?
- A friend.

257
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,420
Have a name...Frie?

258
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,960
- Nick.
- He thinks his name is bobby.

259
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,700
Room 331.Ten minutes.

260
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,470
I wanted to be a doctor.Um,but my d...

261
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,340
She doesn't want to hear about
your life history,bernie.

262
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,320
- I told you to keep your tp shut.
- Sorry.

263
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,340
I didn't think doctors cleaned out urinals.

264
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,950
We draw the line at bedpans.

265
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,500
Want to take a 15 minute break with me?

266
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,090
- We'll be in the cafeteria,arly.
- Okay,doctor.

267
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,130
And clock that ten minutes.

268
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,470
What's with you calling at loser bobby?

269
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,950
Well,he was doing deniro in the elevator.

270
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,300
You know,like,: you talkin' to me?

271
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,750
You talkin' to me?So i called him bobby.

272
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,440
Sometimes you are so juvenile.

273
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,670
Yes,but it makes me loveable.

274
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,670
You don't look so good,dee.

275
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,740
- I don't feel so good,bernie.
- Does it hurt?

276
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,690
Shut up,bernie.

277
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,260
You got to get out ohere.

278
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,750
- Man,they won't let me out.
- They can't keep you.

279
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,390
All yogot to do is sign a release.

280
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,270
- What...What about my le
- We'll fix it later.

281
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,830
- I can't walk.
- That's why they make the chairs with those...

282
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,210
You know,things that go round.

283
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,770
Oh,wheelchairs!

284
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,860
I'm really scared,man.

285
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,050
I'm feeling ally cold,nick.

286
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,090
- I think i might be leaking.
- Be cool,dee,be cool.

287
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,020
- You're not leaking.
- Don't let me die here,man.

288
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,170
You're not going die,honey.

289
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,320
- I got to tell somedy.I've got to tell somebody.
- No,no...

290
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,110
- You're not going to tell anybody nothing!
- Stop!

291
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,300
- Stop it,nick!You're killing him!
- Shut up.

292
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,270
I hope this stops by morning.

293
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,190
I want you to see the house in sunshine.

294
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,760
- It leaks.
- No,it doesn't leak.

295
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,550
It has bats.Bats don't come out in the sunshine.

296
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,600
I hate bats-- ever since i saw dracula.

297
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,830
You're chickening out on me,aren't you?

298
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,820
After you promised?

299
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,240
Did i say scout's honor?

300
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,690
Wow,you drive a hard bargain.Okay.

301
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,500
Yes,i want to see the house.

302
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,990
Just as long as seeing doesn't
necessarily mean buying.

303
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,620
No,of course it doesn't.

304
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:04,040
I just want you to give it some
serious consideration.

305
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,940
Oh,you can count on that.

306
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,920
Especially after last night.
I think that,uh,you deserve.

307
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,430
I'm sorry,hat was you last night,right?

308
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,370
With the mask and the strange headgear?

309
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,020
Code blue.

310
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,930
Code blue.

311
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,460
Hang in there,devon.You're going to be okay.

312
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,960
- Got the pulsox.
- What do we have?

313
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,160
Blood pressure 80/40.Heart 150.

314
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,190
Don't need that drug panel now.

315
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,220
- Where's the crash cart?
- Coming in.

316
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,810
Carly and i have him.Annie,
two milligram naloxone i.v.push.

317
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,020
Got it.Tw milligrams i.v.push.

318
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,070
Lungs are clear.

319
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,430
Pupils are pinpoint and un-reactive.

320
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,540
B.P.75/35,hearrate 160.

321
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,480
Ekg leads.

322
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,850
Okay,lift him on three.

323
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,830
B.p.65/35.Heart rate's 175.

324
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,060
Ekg ads in place.

325
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,990
- He's in v-tach.
- How'd he go sour so fast?

326
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,320
He flew in from caracas three hours ag
he's probably body-packing heroin.

327
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,090
- The bags must have burst.
- We've got v-fib.He's stopped breathing.

328
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,180
Damn.

329
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,350
Start bagging him.Charge to 360.

330
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,500
Ill in v-fib.Should i give him an amp of epi?

331
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,370
Not till wshock him.

332
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,740
Still in v-fib.No pressure,no pulse.
Should i keep bagging him?

333
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,750
We've got to shock him.Everybody clear.

334
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,910
I'm sorry,ms.Watson.

335
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,560
Me,too.

336
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,970
Where's he taking him?

337
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,450
Hospital morgue.

338
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,760
We pick him up there?

339
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,350
No,you do not pick him up there.

340
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,380
Sign it,bernie.

341
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,560
How's carly?

342
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,740
Not bad considering she saw the angel of death.

343
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,400
What did this one look like?

344
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,750
Shirley temple.

345
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,090
I don't like losing patients.

346
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,990
If your brotr had told us he was body-packing drugs,
we might have saved him.

347
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,440
Or if you had told us.

348
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,500
I don't know what's in dee's gut,d.

349
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,130
And neither do you.

350
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,570
Now...

351
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,630
Where do we pick up his body?

352
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,510
City morgue after he's been autopsied.

353
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,410
We don't need an autopsy.

354
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,590
I do.

355
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,390
Come on,we got to get out of here.

356
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,590
Suck it up,bernie!

357
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,510
You got to get me somethin',nick.

358
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,450
I'm gettin' too shaky to walk.

359
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,850
Pharmacy downstairs. 
I'll get cough syrup with codeine.

360
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,490
That ain't gonna help much.

361
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,310
Never pimp a junkie.

362
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,600
I ain't a junkie!

363
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,680
Then walk out of here!

364
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,440
Get going.

365
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,610
He knew devon was body-packing and said nothing.

366
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,520
Well,he didn't want to lose his shipment.

367
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,260
That makes him an accessory.

368
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,470
Yeah? How could you prove that,anne?

369
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,860
I don't know,
but i can't just let him walk out of here.

370
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,800
Dr.Benoit, you don't want to get involved.

371
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,640
I am involved,annie.

372
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,220
That boy didn't ha to die.

373
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,470
No,but that is not your fault.

374
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,230
Jeanne,
the coroner's going to do an autopsy.

375
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,280
He's going to find the drugs,
notify narcotics.

376
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,120
What more can you do thathat?

377
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,450
I...

378
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,820
Don't know.

379
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,810
I feel so damn helpless!

380
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,620
They're all like that the first year.

381
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,620
At least the good ones.

382
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,150
It takes a little while to get calluses.

383
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,200
I don't know if jeanne ever will,annie.

384
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,350
Love.

385
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,090
You pushed the wrong button!

386
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,640
Sorry.

387
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,200
What are you doing down here?

388
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,950
Push the wrong button.

389
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,750
Morgue down here?

390
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:35,870
Why?

391
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,680
Bernie might want to take a last look at her brother.

392
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,090
Morgue's closed.

393
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,450
There's no one down here,anyway.

394
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,880
Her brother's here.

395
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,730
I don't think that's funny.

396
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,870
Hey,boss,what's up?

397
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,700
There's a letter on your de.

398
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,930
Signt.

399
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,150
What is it?

400
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,720
Just sign it,tim.

401
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,880
It's a get out of jail free card.

402
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,760
Boss,why would i need such a card?

403
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,540
Because you're going to hack into the cia.

404
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,300
Wake up!

405
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,050
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

406
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,910
Okay,i know you guys have been working really hard lately,

407
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,790
and i promised that you could have the weekend off

408
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,970
but this sounds like an emergency,

409
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:59,590
so i need everybody to get those electrons flowing!

410
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,950
If anybody is not up to it,

411
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,740
i need to know now,

412
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,560
not when the director arrives.

413
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,810
Something's wrong.

414
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,810
Ready.

415
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,260
Thanks for coming in on such short notice,abby.

416
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:35,260
Neither rain,nor snow,nor sleet,nor hail

417
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:38,230
will keep this scientist fromer appointed rounds.

418
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,230
Nice.

419
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,030
You've adoed what the post office has forgotten.

420
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,070
Did you climb the eiffel tower?

421
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,800
No.

422
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,040
No?

423
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,280
How can you be in paris and not climb the eiffel tower?

424
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,150
I want to know whose fingerprints are on these.

425
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,460
Chain of evidence is not important.

426
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,680
I'll be in my office.

427
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,610
boss,you were right.

428
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:22,140
The order to polygraph came from homeland security's
assistant director for infrastructure protection.

429
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,640
But it didn't originate from there.

430
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,820
I traced into his imap account using
an encryption algorithm developed...

431
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,080
You're not really interested in how i did this,are you?

432
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,290
Nope,i'm not.

433
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:36,360
Okay,well,the order went from homeland security to china,
then kurdistan.

434
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,390
It went through a secondary server in india the island of cypress.

435
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,240
Then through puerto rico.

436
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,530
Where it followed a bank line back to d.c. And...

437
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,780
Cia.

438
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,240
Specifically,their national clandestine service.

439
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,620
It went in and out of a maze of incoming anoutgoing blk op chatter.

440
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,580
All encrypted.

441
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,070
That's where i lost it.

442
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,520
But i found it again.

443
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,900
It's part of a black op.

444
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,500
It's code-named lodestone.

445
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:05,330
Running out of the cia section for weapons control
and arms proliferation.

446
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,350
The frog.

447
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,450
Who do i have to thank for this?

448
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,480
A former fbi agent.

449
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,090
You're very resourceful,kort.

450
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,330
I try.

451
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,890
So you've recorded their conversations?

452
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,780
No.

453
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,450
No? Why?

454
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,090
You didn't want to intrude on their privacy?

455
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,230
I didn't think it was necessary.

456
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,720
No? Why was that?

457
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,030
I only needed photos for leverage.

458
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,990
Ah,this dinozzo is married?

459
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,210
No.

460
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,340
Then how did you intend to gain leverage?

461
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,960
Oh,you intend to harm her?

462
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,520
Only threaten.

463
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,800
He loves her,hmm?

464
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:13,810
Dinozzo-- he's a player.

465
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,860
Never with a skirt more than a few weeks.

466
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:19,280
Hmm,that's too bad.

467
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,480
A man in love could be persuaded...

468
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,040
Do almost anything.

469
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,100
Dinozzo's a white hat.

470
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,140
He won't want to see her harmed.

471
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,190
Have you not noticed,kort?

472
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,800
I like white hats.

473
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,370
shirley temple looked through the door...

474
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,580
Shirley temple?

475
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,340
I didn't say shley temple.

476
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,040
Who is shirley temple?

477
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:52,420
Uha child star from the 1930s with curly blonde hair.

478
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,320
Well,you saw him.

479
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,790
If you say he looked like shirley temple,
he looked like shirley temple.

480
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,550
I didn't see him,carly.

481
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,260
The angel was standing right behind you.

482
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,000
Your angel of death...

483
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,620
Wandered away from her mother in icu.

484
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,700
They flew in from pariso see their grandfather who stroked.

485
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,920
Security's been searching the hospital for an hour.

486
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,640
Oh,if you see the angel of death again r name is sarah.

487
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,830
It's just a lost little girl,carly.

488
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,870
If you say so,doctor.

489
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,010
All right,well,will see you in the morning.

490
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:24,990
I gotta go.

491
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,410
I'll be out at 7:00.

492
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,360
And ifou see a hooded skeleton,duck.

493
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,720
Dr.benoit.

494
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,730
That addict and her pimp were down in the basement
asking about the morgue.

495
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,700
You didn't let them stay there?

496
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,150
Of course not.
I made them returnith me to the ground floor.

497
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,190
They leave the hospital?

498
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,550
They went into the pharmacy.

499
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,790
I had to return the rney to the er,

500
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,260
but i got a feeling they're going to try again.

501
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,310
Thanks,bill.

502
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,050
Annie,call security.

503
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,360
Ask them to meet me in the morgue.

504
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,500
Miss me already?

505
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:59,070
Our grieving couple may be in the morgue.

506
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,350
Damn.

507
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,440
They never make it easy.

508
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,380
He's not in the cabinet,bernie.

509
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,370
I drank the cough syrup and it ain't doing nothing.

510
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,250
No drugs in a morgue,dummy.

511
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,160
You want a fix-- find your brother.

512
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,630
Nick.

513
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,910
Hi ya,dee.

514
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,230
Hey!

515
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,080
Jeanne.

516
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,180
'S still warm.

517
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,620
That's 'cause he hasn't had time to cool.

518
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:08,930
Have you,dee?

519
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,540
Jeanne,slow down.

520
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,290
- Is it...
- Shh.

521
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,930
Jeanne,hey.

522
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,690
You trying to get yourself killed?

523
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,840
He's at least got a knife in there.

524
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,410
I will not let him butcher her brother in front of r.

525
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,460
Keep your voice down.

526
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,320
Those drugs are in 25 feet of intestines.

527
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,680
He doesn't know where to cut.

528
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,790
He'llake a gory mess she'll never get out of her head.

529
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,320
Get behind me.

530
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,520
Why?

531
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,320
Because i tell you to.

532
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,180
Haven't got a weapon on you by any chance,have you?

533
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:57,100
I have a funny feeling,doctor.

534
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,860
It's the tequila,my dear.

535
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,320
You've had three shooters just in the time i've been here.

536
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,870
Straight to voice ma.

537
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,770
Just like always when he's th her.

538
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,890
Tony?

539
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,950
What?

540
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,720
Nothing.

541
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:14,980
Oh,no,no,no. That look was definitely something.

542
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:17,320
Well,why do you monitor tony?

543
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,880
I don't monitor tony.

544
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:22,220
Oh,yes,you do,my dear,like a mother with her toddler.

545
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,960
That's a good description.

546
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:29,050
Or a woman wit a wayward lover.

547
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,860
Ducky...

548
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:34,020
Do not profile me-- i'm not a killer.

549
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:38,930
Correction-- i have killed before,
but never feloniously.

550
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,250
Ziva,it's friday night.

551
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:46,470
Tony is with his girlfriend
and you are worried about him

552
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,070
what does that tell you?

553
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,030
He is my partner.

554
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,340
And my partner said he would be here.

555
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,430
And...

556
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,800
And i have this...

557
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,480
Not good feeling.

558
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,010
I didn't find nothing.

559
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,750
The way you're shaking,
you couldn't find a shotgun.

560
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,410
Let's see...

561
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,900
You called security,doc?

562
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,760
Of course you did.

563
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,910
Call 'em off.

564
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,890
I said call 'em off.

565
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,880
You haven't done anything that can't be forgotten.

566
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,720
Do what he says,jeanne.

567
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,770
Why?

568
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:49,040
They can leave now,
and we'll forget this ever happened.

569
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,800
Would you do that?

570
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,240
Yes.

571
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,800
Tony...

572
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,820
Will you forget now?

573
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,920
That's what i thought.

574
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,250
Call off security.

575
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,630
Put it on the speaker.

576
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,170
securityjackson.

577
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,420
This is dr.Benoit in the morgue.

578
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,690
Oh,sorry,doctor.

579
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,960
I'll have a man there in a minute.

580
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,860
We're just stretched thin looking for that little girl.

581
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,260
You can recall him.

582
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,190
It was a false alarm.

583
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,300
Okay. Can i have your hospital i.d.number please?

584
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,080
766.

585
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,080
Thank you,dr.Benoit.

586
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,480
Is a little girl lost?

587
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,000
More than one.

588
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,340
Surgery first,doc.

589
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,780
No.

590
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,040
No?

591
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:07,010
I help him first.

592
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,720
You're a slow learner,doc.

593
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,000
i called off security.

594
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,500
I help him,then...

595
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,910
I help you.

596
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:22,090
If that's not good enough,shoot me.

597
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,230
Don't hurt her,nick.

598
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,670
Tony?

599
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,710
Tony?

600
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,260
Can you sit up?

601
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,290
No,i'm up.

602
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,460
someone is lookingt me.

603
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,690
Its the cleaning crew.

604
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
No,on the computer.

605
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,040
I got to shut down my upd port.

606
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:54,970
I don't think it penetrated my firewall.

607
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,050
What the hell is it?

608
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,950
It's a botagent it's probably one of the cia's.

609
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,010
Botagent-- short for robotic agent.

610
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,930
Designed to crawl the internet
looking for snoopers like us.

611
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,850
This for real?

612
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,640
Oh,yeah,boss.

613
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:09,130
If this had penetrated my firewall,
it could have downloaded my hard drive.

614
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,670
The cia woulhave all our data,
and know we were onto lodestone.

615
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,590
Can you kill it?

616
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,020
No,though i could build a mirror to my firewall,

617
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,720
so that when it looks in, it could just see itself.

618
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,760
How long?

619
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,590
Too long.

620
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,390
Or i could use another computer.

621
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,300
Boss,justne thing...

622
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,220
There'always just one thing,mcgee.

623
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:32,580
A really smart botagent won't just sit on my computer.

624
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,450
It'll look for my search patterns on the internet.

625
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,810
This is like tracking a dirtbag,mcgee.

626
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,480
You stake out his house.

627
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,210
You put out a bolo.

628
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,400
Keep tabs on the girl.

629
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,870
Never thought of it that way.

630
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,380
Start a new search.

631
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,680
Okay.

632
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:49,980
What am i looking for?

633
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,210
The girlfriend-- jenny shepard.

634
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:58,090
When you look at me like that,mcgee,

635
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,950
i get this overwhelming urge to head slap you.

636
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:19,330
I am going to get...A ding.

637
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,590
Now!

638
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:27,530
You guys are doing this because it's the weekend.

639
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,400
And you think if you just stall,

640
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,980
then i'll give up and i'll finish the search on monday,

641
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,800
but that is not going to happen.

642
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,080
Abby...

643
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,300
You worry me.

644
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:43,550
Oh,they know i'm just,you know,
talking to them to pasthe time.

645
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:47,550
Because at this point,
the fingerprint match is totally up to afis.

646
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:48,730
Right,guys?

647
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,940
Right,guys?

648
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,620
I'm just joshing you,director.

649
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,480
I spoiled your friday night.

650
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:58,550
Oh,you know,i s just hanging at the bar.

651
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,800
And i probably would have been completely passed
ouby now if i'd stayed.

652
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,790
Joshing me again?

653
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,110
No.

654
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,620
Yes.

655
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,750
How many prints?

656
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,230
Two sets.

657
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,260
He poured with his left hd
and held the glass with his right.

658
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,030
Left-handed?

659
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,140
Or ambidextrous.

660
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,150
I can pour with either hand.

661
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,930
I can tell you he's not litary.

662
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,300
Afis would have gotten a match on anyone
on active dutby now.

663
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,790
What if he was retired?

664
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,300
Covered them,too.

665
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,470
Dead?

666
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,530
Dead?

667
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,670
You said this wasn't a case.

668
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,980
It's not.

669
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:40,980
I want you to expand the search
to include servicemen alive prior to '95.

670
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,190
Okay.

671
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,800
I don't see any signs of concussion.

672
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:54,170
I've been t harder by my sister.

673
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,970
You don't have a sister.

674
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,070
I don't?

675
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,170
Nick...

676
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,090
Enough playing,doctor.

677
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,350
Do it. I don't want you to get hurt.

678
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,430
Let's go.

679
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,790
Half k of pure horse in here,doc.

680
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,000
I'm no surgeon.

681
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,340
I'm not asking you to save a life,doc.

682
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,950
Oh. Maybe i am.

683
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,450
Come on,come on,co on!

684
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,740
Quit stalling. He doesn't have aids.

685
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,540
That's not what the mask's for.

686
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,830
What's it for?

687
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,120
Turn around,bernie.

688
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,790
Please hurry.

689
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:43,700
- Why the mask
- tell her to turn around.

690
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:44,830
Do it,bernie.

691
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:52,110
The mask is to ptect me from disease spread 
by airborne particles releed when i open him up.

692
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,370
No more stalling.

693
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,300
Von died bringing this to you.

694
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,890
Want it?

695
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,760
What the hell do youhink?

696
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,430
Bitch!

697
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,460
Next one's in your ear.

698
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,730
Drop it.

699
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,000
You okay ?

700
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,960
not really.

701
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,430
Oh,god.

702
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,960
Who's this?

703
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,290
It's uh,director's father--
colonel jasper shepard.

704
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,820
You don't know him?

705
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,360
She never talked family.

706
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,680
Like you.

707
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,020
she has his eyes.

708
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,520
He still alive?

709
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,580
Deceased.

710
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:54,250
Suicide,12 years ago.

711
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,190
- There she goes.
- Who?

712
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,170
Sarah.

713
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,120
Security found her sleeping in the delivery room.

714
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:35,640
You should be under observation for 24 hours.

715
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,620
Whatever doctor orders.

716
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,780
At's this?

717
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,890
My secret.

718
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,370
Bonjour,papa.

719
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,600
Bonjour,muffin.

720
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:58,790

721
