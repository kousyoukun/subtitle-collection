1
00:00:03,613 --> 00:00:04,599
Check that eyebolt.

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,810
- Just let that... on.
- Secure eyebolt.

3
00:00:07,146 --> 00:00:09,670
All right, get ready, ladies.
Put your backs into it.

4
00:00:10,194 --> 00:00:12,778
Come on, I used to do this
when I was your age by myself.

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:13,942
- Sure, you did, boss.
- Yeah, right.

6
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:14,997
See these pythons?

7
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:18,874
I could lift a 400-pound
load back in the day, huh?

8
00:00:18,884 --> 00:00:21,311
I even remember her
name: Lisa Scarpizzee.

9
00:00:22,318 --> 00:00:24,291
Yeah, well she was a hell
of a woman though, huh?

10
00:00:24,656 --> 00:00:26,766
All right, let's move
this thing out of here.

11
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:28,335
I've got a furnace waiting to go in.

12
00:00:28,453 --> 00:00:30,190
Push her out, guys. Come on, here we go.

13
00:00:31,216 --> 00:00:32,351
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

14
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:33,760
Hey, Manny?

15
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:34,530
Yeah?

16
00:00:34,737 --> 00:00:37,352
Looks like a partial
obstruction in the smokestack.

17
00:00:37,598 --> 00:00:39,079
Yeah, I see it from up here, boss.

18
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,301
Probably carbon buildup.

19
00:00:40,637 --> 00:00:41,614
All right, clean it out.

20
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:42,492
Doing that now.

21
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,080
Anybody that doesn't want to make an ash

22
00:00:44,081 --> 00:00:45,430
of themselves, step back.

23
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,535
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

24
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:50,867
Hold it up, Manny.

25
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:52,939
We've got more than just
carbon coming down here.

26
00:00:53,048 --> 00:00:53,540
Copy that.

27
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:53,094
Finish McGee's book yet?

28
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:54,370
Halfway.

29
00:01:54,578 --> 00:01:54,944
You?

30
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,503
I'm on... chapter seven,

31
00:01:59,504 --> 00:02:02,099
page 103.

32
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:04,314
"Maybe someday

33
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,183
"Lisa would find the
courage to tell agent Tommy

34
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:09,864
"about her dream, the two
of them together, their

35
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:12,610
"bodies covered in sweat
as they made love on

36
00:02:12,918 --> 00:02:14,843
the crystal white
sands of her homeland."

37
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:16,152
I'm gonna kill him.

38
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,618
- Kill who?
- McGee.

39
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:18,780
Have you read this book?

40
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:20,908
Apparently McGee thinks
Ziva's in love with me.

41
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,144
There's a reason they
call it fiction, DiNozzo.

42
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,587
Boss, just got a call from dispatch.

43
00:02:25,588 --> 00:02:27,144
Construction crew found a dead body.

44
00:02:27,254 --> 00:02:27,772
Where?

45
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:29,814
Chesty Puller High School in Quantico.

46
00:02:30,146 --> 00:02:30,892
Student?

47
00:02:31,637 --> 00:02:33,039
Uh...not sure.

48
00:02:33,323 --> 00:02:34,599
Take the truck, I'll meet you there.

49
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,603
How many times do I have to tell you...

50
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:45,017
it's not about you guys.

51
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:48,669
I'm driving.

52
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,293
Comfortable back there, Gore Vidal?

53
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:57,301
<i>For the last time, Deep Six is fiction.</i>

54
00:02:57,388 --> 00:02:58,776
Fiction based on us, yes?

55
00:02:59,224 --> 00:02:59,816
No.

56
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:01,457
Look, if you don't believe me,

57
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,179
read the disclaimer in
the front of the book.

58
00:03:03,896 --> 00:03:05,340
You buying that, Lisa?

59
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:07,645
Didn't think so.

60
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:09,656
Nice knowing you, Probie.

61
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:11,669
Ziva...

62
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:17,081
It's just a book!

63
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,670
You know, in chapter eight

64
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:22,889
of McGee's book, your character does

65
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,638
the exact same thing to Agent Tommy.

66
00:03:25,168 --> 00:03:27,719
Turns out she has this whole
secret photo album of him.

67
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:29,007
Fascinating, Tony,

68
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,346
but I wasn't taking a picture of you.

69
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:32,279
More interested in the wildlife.

70
00:03:34,262 --> 00:03:34,666
Ugh!

71
00:03:35,518 --> 00:03:37,634
We've pulled rats, cats

72
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,901
and birds out of chimneys
before, Agent Gibbs.

73
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:42,736
Hell, one time even a St. Bernard,

74
00:03:43,494 --> 00:03:45,123
but this is my first mummy.

75
00:03:46,582 --> 00:03:47,965
Reminds me of that urban legend.

76
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:49,645
Which one is that?

77
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:51,337
Guy dresses up like Santa,

78
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:53,667
you know, for Christmas Eve
to surprise his girlfriend,

79
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,158
but he never shows.

80
00:03:55,373 --> 00:03:57,419
She's convinced that
the bastard dumped her,

81
00:03:57,798 --> 00:03:59,263
badmouths him all over town.

82
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,833
Until they find the poor soul's body

83
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:05,477
months later still
clutching the little box

84
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,877
with her shiny new engagement ring.

85
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:10,220
And the moral of course is...

86
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:12,272
"It's never a good idea to get married."

87
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:15,922
No."It's best not to judge someone
until all the facts are in."

88
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,584
I like mine better.

89
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:20,469
Any of your crew touch
or move Kriss Kringle?

90
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,761
No. Most of 'em were halfway to Manassas

91
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,152
before the dust even settled.

92
00:04:24,657 --> 00:04:25,870
There's no I.D. on him.

93
00:04:25,908 --> 00:04:27,246
Judging by what's left of the mullet,

94
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:28,964
I think it's safe to say
he wasn't in the military.

95
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:30,227
You think, DiNozzo?

96
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:31,054
Hey,...

97
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,018
I need a TOD, Doctor.

98
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:36,157
Considering we've been working
together for over ten years,

99
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:38,487
I am well aware of that, Agent Gibbs.

100
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:40,281
DiNozzo, when he gets
one, run it through

101
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:42,163
Missing Persons over
the same time period.

102
00:04:42,643 --> 00:04:43,419
Where are you going, boss?

103
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:44,984
To the roof, to figure out

104
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,564
how he ended up there
in the first place.

105
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:48,395
What happened to you?

106
00:04:48,644 --> 00:04:51,881
Uh, creative differences
with my coworkers, boss.

107
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:53,633
A lot of that going around these days.

108
00:04:54,612 --> 00:04:56,797
Don't you think it's about time
you and Gibbs made up, Ducky?

109
00:04:57,226 --> 00:04:57,889
Made up?

110
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,908
I wasn't aware we were fighting, Ziva.

111
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:01,707
Come on. Ever since he retired...

112
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,360
Gibbs didn't retire, he quit.

113
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:07,549
Okay, so he quit, but he's back now.

114
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,803
You need to cut the
man some slacks, Ducky.

115
00:05:10,157 --> 00:05:12,373
I agree. Except the term is "slack."

116
00:05:12,784 --> 00:05:15,613
Judging by the decay and
the condition of his skin,

117
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:17,950
I'd tentatively place
the time of death at...

118
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:19,964
two to four months ago.

119
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,082
Works for me.

120
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,865
Time of death was two
to four months ago, boss!

121
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:28,546
Bag and tag the ashes, Probie.

122
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:31,369
We'll pick you up after
we coordinate with the MPs.

123
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:34,450
Doctor, I'm going to be
laying the bag out here

124
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:35,202
and...

125
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:37,886
the burrito over here.

126
00:05:40,204 --> 00:05:41,283
Palmer, I need a favor.

127
00:05:42,686 --> 00:05:43,728
You want to ride back with us.

128
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:45,104
How'd you know?

129
00:05:45,824 --> 00:05:46,822
I read your book.

130
00:05:47,637 --> 00:05:48,362
And for your information,

131
00:05:48,363 --> 00:05:50,472
I've never had sexual
relations with a corpse.

132
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:52,531
That character was not based on you.

133
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:55,214
His name was Pimmy Jalmer, McGee.

134
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,669
He's French Polynesian.

135
00:05:58,187 --> 00:05:59,860
Doctor, I'm going to get the gurney now.

136
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:02,197
It was only a dream.

137
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:05,944
Come on. Haven't you
ever heard of symbolism?

138
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,607
The life of an artist
is never easy, McGee.

139
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,436
They'll all get over it, eventually.

140
00:06:14,217 --> 00:06:15,075
Thanks, Ducky.

141
00:06:15,322 --> 00:06:18,454
By the way, do you know if
Tony has finished it yet?

142
00:06:19,363 --> 00:06:20,134
Not yet.

143
00:06:21,062 --> 00:06:22,470
Well, him I'd watch out for.

144
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:27,263
None of the local missing person reports

145
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:29,344
match our John Doe's description, Tony.

146
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:32,536
And there's no record
of anyone going missing

147
00:06:32,537 --> 00:06:33,338
on base,

148
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,647
civilian or military,
during that period.

149
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,959
Are you even listening to me?

150
00:06:39,325 --> 00:06:41,346
I'm getting close to the end, Ziva.

151
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:46,088
You know, McGee is really
starting to nail your essence here.

152
00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:47,654
"Stakeouts...

153
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:50,029
"long, endless hours

154
00:06:50,092 --> 00:06:52,114
"fueled by cheap food

155
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:54,399
"and even cheaper coffee.

156
00:06:55,422 --> 00:06:59,160
"But tonight, Mossad Officer
Lisa didn't seem to mind,

157
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:01,661
"because she was getting to
spend it with Agent Tom...

158
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:02,488
"Agent Tom..."

159
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,825
You're behind me again, aren't you?

160
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:06,173
Lucky Guess.

161
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:09,005
You know, I think McGee's right.

162
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:10,641
He was, was he?

163
00:07:11,462 --> 00:07:14,284
It takes almost all of my willpower

164
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:16,684
to resist the urges I have
when I'm around you, Tony.

165
00:07:17,973 --> 00:07:18,699
Maybe...

166
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:21,547
it's about time I just...

167
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:23,637
give in, yes?

168
00:07:25,804 --> 00:07:27,105
And by "give in, " you mean...?

169
00:07:27,106 --> 00:07:28,414
- Letting loose.
- Ah...

170
00:07:28,627 --> 00:07:30,010
Doing what comes naturally to me.

171
00:07:30,388 --> 00:07:32,024
Yeah, I thought I was
picking up that vibe

172
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:33,684
the first time we went
undercover together.

173
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:34,942
You were?

174
00:07:36,394 --> 00:07:38,079
In fact, I almost did it

175
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,229
the first night in the hotel room.

176
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:40,492
Hmm. Really?

177
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,741
But my father wouldn't approve.

178
00:07:42,943 --> 00:07:44,344
Because I'm not Jewish.

179
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,959
Because he gets very
angry when I kill...

180
00:07:47,313 --> 00:07:48,197
a co-worker.

181
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,537
Like I believed you for even a second.

182
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:53,760
I'm sure you didn't.

183
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:56,362
You two done playing grabass?

184
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:57,644
Oh, he started it.

185
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:58,730
I'm ending it.

186
00:07:59,090 --> 00:07:59,734
Oh, I...

187
00:07:59,735 --> 00:08:01,803
Next person who mentions this book

188
00:08:01,804 --> 00:08:04,076
will be deep-sixed by me.

189
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,907
I can completely live with that, boss.

190
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:07,365
My point exactly, DiNozzo.

191
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:08,528
You I.D. our victim yet?

192
00:08:08,744 --> 00:08:10,541
We're running him against
missing person cases

193
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:12,652
reported over the
last six months, Gibbs.

194
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:13,599
No hits yet.

195
00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:16,125
Um, I'm afraid that's my fault.

196
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:18,076
It seems...

197
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:20,526
my initial time of death

198
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,643
wasn't completely accurate.

199
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:23,999
As you will see,

200
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,494
his body is almost perfectly preserved.

201
00:08:27,138 --> 00:08:29,664
Perfectly preserved for a rotted corpse,

202
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:30,447
that is.

203
00:08:30,662 --> 00:08:32,228
Guy looks like a piece
of beef jerky, Duck.

204
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,950
Gum tissue rots faster than the...

205
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:36,554
outer flesh,

206
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:39,402
due to the high degree of
bacteria inside the mouth.

207
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,859
As you can see, his gums...

208
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,475
are almost intact.

209
00:08:44,277 --> 00:08:45,565
Maybe he was just a good flosser.

210
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:47,940
Shutting it, boss.

211
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:49,443
How'd he die?

212
00:08:49,506 --> 00:08:51,287
Well, the "how" I'm still working on.

213
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:53,086
It's made particularly difficult

214
00:08:53,087 --> 00:08:55,196
by the means by which
his body was preserved.

215
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:57,071
He was quite literally smoked

216
00:08:57,311 --> 00:08:58,435
inside that chimney.

217
00:08:58,461 --> 00:08:59,144
Smoked?

218
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,094
Yeah, like a fine cut of meat.

219
00:09:01,258 --> 00:09:02,635
So he really is a beef jerky.

220
00:09:02,856 --> 00:09:05,330
In a manner of speaking, yes, Tony.

221
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:07,478
It's also the reason
why my time of death

222
00:09:07,491 --> 00:09:08,508
was so far off.

223
00:09:08,691 --> 00:09:10,402
More than two to four months, Ducky?

224
00:09:10,819 --> 00:09:11,784
It would seem so.

225
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:12,423
How many?

226
00:09:12,973 --> 00:09:13,876
I would say

227
00:09:13,877 --> 00:09:16,591
we're looking at closer to five or six.

228
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:18,599
Don't be so rough on yourself, Doctor.

229
00:09:18,776 --> 00:09:20,361
We're already running
the past six months.

230
00:09:20,614 --> 00:09:21,782
Not months...

231
00:09:22,893 --> 00:09:23,834
years.

232
00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:28,482
Abby, they hate me.

233
00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:30,086
They don't hate you, McGee.

234
00:09:30,585 --> 00:09:32,183
Ziva tried to kill me yesterday.

235
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:33,124
Well...

236
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,711
you did base all the
characters in your book on us

237
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,479
and didn't ask our permission.

238
00:09:38,555 --> 00:09:40,923
<i>Deep Six is a work of pure fiction.</i>

239
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:45,484
You described everything in my bedroom.

240
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:46,663
Not everything.

241
00:09:47,876 --> 00:09:48,791
You still have those...

242
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:50,743
Fantasize later, Hemingway.

243
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:54,734
I got a match on two of
Old Smokey's fingerprints.

244
00:09:56,148 --> 00:09:57,165
- Whoa!
- What's wrong?

245
00:09:57,601 --> 00:09:59,293
The match file is restricted.

246
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,386
I can't access it.

247
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:01,224
That's not possible.

248
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,144
NCIS has top-level clearance.

249
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,724
Duh, McGee.I work here, too.

250
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:06,480
Can you tell who's blocking it?

251
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:07,218
I could...

252
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:09,877
if they weren't in the process of
deleting the file from the server.

253
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:11,241
What the hell is this?

254
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,422
I was wondering that myself.

255
00:10:12,586 --> 00:10:14,051
We got two matching fingerprints

256
00:10:14,052 --> 00:10:16,211
from the victim and
AFIS just kicked us out.

257
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,657
And now they're deleting the file.

258
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:18,276
How?

259
00:10:18,724 --> 00:10:19,672
Working on it, boss.

260
00:10:19,905 --> 00:10:21,516
It looks like some agency

261
00:10:21,517 --> 00:10:23,176
doesn't want us to
know who the mummy is,

262
00:10:23,177 --> 00:10:23,821
Gibbs

263
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,544
Inbound G-Five from Ibiza, Spain.

264
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:37,484
Tango-Eight,

265
00:10:37,485 --> 00:10:39,076
I want every bag coming off

266
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:41,502
that plane tagged with a GPS marker.

267
00:10:41,596 --> 00:10:42,556
Eagle Six,

268
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:44,229
remain in over-watch.

269
00:10:44,248 --> 00:10:46,882
Tango-Eight is on his own,
unless I clear you for backup.

270
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:47,639
Solid Copy,

271
00:10:47,854 --> 00:10:49,824
Eagle Six remaining
in over-watch position.

272
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:58,349
Bring up Tango-Eight's
feed on the big screen.

273
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:09,931
Hey, there.

274
00:11:10,223 --> 00:11:10,878
How y'all doing?

275
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:12,662
Toss 'em down, bro.

276
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:16,725
Ooh.

277
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:17,718
Louis Vuitton.

278
00:11:20,227 --> 00:11:21,640
Y'all aren't too friendly, are you?

279
00:11:32,718 --> 00:11:33,697
This is Eagle Six.

280
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:34,841
Cabin crew are exiting.

281
00:11:35,283 --> 00:11:35,984
Tango-Eight,

282
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,329
La Grenouille's people
are about to deplane.

283
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,750
The smile was for me, dear boy.

284
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:52,802
There's more luggage.

285
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,295
Yes, sir.

286
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:03,932
Good flight?

287
00:12:05,936 --> 00:12:07,404
Very nice, Kort, very nice.

288
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:09,692
Martin, where's he been keeping you?

289
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:10,726
The African market.

290
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,925
Cape Town, mostly.

291
00:12:11,926 --> 00:12:13,086
- Not bad.
- Good.

292
00:12:15,373 --> 00:12:17,472
I need to see the passengers.

293
00:12:17,813 --> 00:12:18,823
We've arranged a meeting.

294
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:20,276
Things are going well.

295
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:22,764
Isolate and freeze frame.

296
00:12:39,695 --> 00:12:40,895
How long have you been here?

297
00:12:41,944 --> 00:12:43,987
Well, long enough to put
your luggage in the trunk.

298
00:12:44,721 --> 00:12:46,559
How long have you been working the line?

299
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,751
I haven't seen you before.

300
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:48,730
Oh...

301
00:12:49,431 --> 00:12:50,394
about five months,...

302
00:12:50,717 --> 00:12:52,516
I'd say.You know, part-time.Weekends,

303
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:53,479
nights, that sort of thing.

304
00:12:58,552 --> 00:13:00,375
Can you keep your
eyes off her next time?

305
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:02,757
Probably not.

306
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,861
An honest man.

307
00:13:09,532 --> 00:13:10,206
Thank you, sir.

308
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:17,858
Eagle Six, confirm four GPS markers.

309
00:13:18,024 --> 00:13:20,802
Eagle Six. Four GPS markers confirmed.

310
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:22,632
Signals are long and strong.

311
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:25,432
Bravo Zulu, Tango-Eight.

312
00:13:25,898 --> 00:13:26,600
Bravo...

313
00:13:27,356 --> 00:13:28,169
Two hours.

314
00:13:28,595 --> 00:13:29,866
Gibbs is going to murder me.

315
00:13:36,312 --> 00:13:37,919
How long's Tony been doing errands

316
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,761
for the director?

317
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,000
Pretty much since you retired.

318
00:13:41,631 --> 00:13:42,451
She trusts him.

319
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,187
To do what?

320
00:13:45,638 --> 00:13:46,743
You'd have to ask Tony that.

321
00:13:47,154 --> 00:13:48,196
Gibbs! Gibbs! Gibbs!

322
00:13:48,605 --> 00:13:49,418
I did it!

323
00:13:49,654 --> 00:13:50,839
Well, you mean "we."

324
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:52,787
There is no "we" in McGee.

325
00:13:53,245 --> 00:13:54,349
I traced the connection back

326
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:56,156
to the system that deleted
the fingerprint match.

327
00:13:56,157 --> 00:13:58,049
It's a government server
in Arlington, Virginia.

328
00:13:58,065 --> 00:14:00,307
Routed into AFIS directly at the source.

329
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,500
Our mystery hacker is... The FBI.

330
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:05,664
Uh, yeah. Sounds a little
anticlimactic when you say it.

331
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:06,941
How did you know that?

332
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:08,662
I'm looking at 'em.

333
00:14:11,463 --> 00:14:13,711
You've got something
that belongs to me, Gibbs.

334
00:14:16,171 --> 00:14:17,560
Petri dish, Mr. Palmer.

335
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:20,126
There's something weird in
this young man's stomach.

336
00:14:21,844 --> 00:14:22,168
Is that...

337
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:24,007
is that what I think it is?

338
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,501
A distal interphlangeal joint.

339
00:14:27,415 --> 00:14:28,370
A human toe.

340
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:30,051
He was a cannibal, Ducky...

341
00:14:30,406 --> 00:14:31,590
and a serial killer.

342
00:14:33,554 --> 00:14:36,174
I've been hunting this
bastard for 12 years, Gibbs.

343
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:37,184
What's his name?

344
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,262
You don't know.

345
00:14:42,746 --> 00:14:44,323
We know the prints you ran through AFIS

346
00:14:44,324 --> 00:14:46,502
matched two of the prints
from his crime scenes.

347
00:14:46,707 --> 00:14:48,047
Fourteen kills...

348
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:49,444
all women...

349
00:14:50,168 --> 00:14:50,776
drugged,

350
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:54,336
strangled, left to rot near
rural, interstate highways.

351
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,774
Every one of them missing
the toes on their left foot.

352
00:14:57,745 --> 00:14:58,715
They were gnawed off.

353
00:15:00,885 --> 00:15:01,588
How'd he die?

354
00:15:01,746 --> 00:15:03,071
Well, we're still working on that.

355
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:04,049
I can tell you when.

356
00:15:04,886 --> 00:15:06,235
66 months ago.

357
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,802
Five-and-a-half
years.

358
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:09,169
That's a pretty accurate guess.

359
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,629
It wasn't a guess.

360
00:15:11,364 --> 00:15:12,657
It was the last time he killed.

361
00:15:17,343 --> 00:15:19,750
You want to know why I
restricted access to his prints.

362
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:21,399
For starters.

363
00:15:22,315 --> 00:15:23,521
We didn't want local LEOs

364
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,994
trying to bring him down on their own.

365
00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:27,151
That sounds like the FBI.

366
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:28,838
Well, this guy was a ghost, Jethro.

367
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:31,836
Fourteen murders, all
we ever got from him

368
00:15:31,837 --> 00:15:33,932
was two partials and a
single strand of hair.

369
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:35,648
We never even got close.

370
00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:37,614
I am more interested
in what he was doing

371
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:39,390
on my Marine base, Tobias.

372
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:41,355
As soon as I find out,
you'll be the first to know.

373
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:44,038
We got a deal?

374
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:48,519
I'll have my M.E. swing
by and pick up the body.

375
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:52,101
After I find out who
he is and how he died.

376
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,942
I've spent 12 years
working on this case.

377
00:15:54,943 --> 00:15:56,670
Well, then waiting a few extra days

378
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,688
shouldn't be a problem.

379
00:15:59,573 --> 00:16:00,962
Is there anything else I can do for you

380
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:02,469
while you're grinding the knife in?

381
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:04,086
I'm gonna need a sample of that hair

382
00:16:04,568 --> 00:16:05,617
and copies of your files.

383
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:08,338
A few bottles of bourbon
would be a nice gesture.

384
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:10,256
What do I get, besides a headache?

385
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,174
Tobias, I am going to show you

386
00:16:12,175 --> 00:16:13,936
what your serial killer looks like.

387
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,112
I've been rehydrating

388
00:16:15,113 --> 00:16:16,808
Smokey the Bear's head since yesterday.

389
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,466
It makes it easier for identification.

390
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,543
And I've uploaded every
local missing person's sketch

391
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:23,279
and photo into the comparison fields

392
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,691
since the killings stopped.

393
00:16:24,731 --> 00:16:26,891
As soon as the rendering
algorithm is complete,

394
00:16:26,892 --> 00:16:28,802
we should have a
fairly accurate likeness

395
00:16:28,803 --> 00:16:30,814
of what Slim Jim looked
like when he was still alive.

396
00:16:30,877 --> 00:16:32,336
As long as the quadrant system

397
00:16:32,337 --> 00:16:34,136
and scales are within the
program's proscribed...

398
00:16:34,137 --> 00:16:34,655
McGee...

399
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:36,921
less talk, more of the
the computer chip doo-da.

400
00:16:37,939 --> 00:16:39,429
Making with the doo-da, boss.

401
00:16:40,006 --> 00:16:40,961
"Doo-da"?

402
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:43,035
Yeah, it's a technical term, Tobias.

403
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:44,234
You wouldn't understand.

404
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:46,815
Pretty cute for a serial
- killing cannibal.

405
00:16:49,205 --> 00:16:52,693
Well, I've got an 86%
match on a Charles Bright,

406
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:54,404
reported missing from Dale City,

407
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:55,983
five years, seven months ago.

408
00:16:56,345 --> 00:16:57,764
Our profiler was convinced

409
00:16:57,765 --> 00:16:59,706
he'd have at least one
body buried near his home.

410
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:00,211
Why?

411
00:17:00,274 --> 00:17:02,090
Something for him to gloat over, Ab.

412
00:17:02,098 --> 00:17:04,196
Relive the rush anytime he wanted to.

413
00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:05,664
That's good, Gibbs.

414
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:07,163
We need an address.

415
00:17:08,882 --> 00:17:10,943
* Do-do-do,
do-do-do *

416
00:17:10,966 --> 00:17:12,502
* Do-da. * *
Do-da. * * Do-da. *

417
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:15,210
That address still good?

418
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:18,202
Uh, wife still lives there.

419
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,170
Karen Bright,

420
00:17:19,257 --> 00:17:20,762
she's the one who reported him missing.

421
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:22,121
There you go, Fornell.

422
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:24,939
You're turning the case over?

423
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,346
No. I just want you to get
my search warrant for me.

424
00:17:34,064 --> 00:17:36,361
I do miss you. I do.

425
00:17:39,848 --> 00:17:40,519
Stop.

426
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:44,032
No, no.

427
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:45,166
What's wrong with this picture?

428
00:17:45,206 --> 00:17:46,941
Besides being late over two hours?

429
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:49,712
Why is the spawn of the
FBI sitting at my desk?

430
00:17:49,932 --> 00:17:52,157
Warrant just came in via the FBI.

431
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:54,032
I made sure NCIS was a co-server.

432
00:17:54,051 --> 00:17:55,092
Warrant for what, Lee?

433
00:17:55,195 --> 00:17:56,646
The serial killer's home.

434
00:17:56,654 --> 00:17:58,714
It covers the grounds and residence.

435
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:00,812
Serial killer? I only
missed like two hours...

436
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:03,527
Snooze you lose,
DiNozzo. Grab your gear.

437
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:04,820
I already have my gear.

438
00:18:04,962 --> 00:18:06,302
Fill you in on the way. Let's go.

439
00:18:06,683 --> 00:18:07,724
Today, DiNozzo!

440
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,312
Geez.

441
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,202
What do we tell her?

442
00:18:13,507 --> 00:18:15,322
The truth, we found her husband.

443
00:18:16,473 --> 00:18:18,865
And the whole serial-killing
cannibalism thing?

444
00:18:21,815 --> 00:18:22,849
Not until we have to.

445
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:26,801
Hi. Your mom home?

446
00:18:27,764 --> 00:18:28,577
Who is it, Amy?

447
00:18:29,863 --> 00:18:31,031
It's the police, Mom.

448
00:18:32,222 --> 00:18:33,161
Mrs. Bright, I'm...

449
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:41,060
He's FBI Agent Fornell,

450
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:42,913
I'm NCIS Special Agent Gibbs.

451
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,162
You, you found him, didn't you?

452
00:18:49,205 --> 00:18:50,381
You found my husband Charlie?

453
00:18:51,202 --> 00:18:53,261
His body was discovered
yesterday in Quantico.

454
00:18:54,712 --> 00:18:56,162
It was an accident, wasn't it?

455
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,397
He was a building inspector.

456
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:01,191
The cause of death
is still undetermined.

457
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:03,510
He would have never abandoned us.

458
00:19:04,528 --> 00:19:05,498
Everyone else thought it,

459
00:19:05,499 --> 00:19:07,005
but I always knew it couldn't be true.

460
00:19:10,534 --> 00:19:11,718
They found Daddy.

461
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:13,691
They finally found him.

462
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:22,763
I'm sorry about that, Jethro.

463
00:19:23,655 --> 00:19:25,707
She could have been a twin
to some of his victims.

464
00:19:25,974 --> 00:19:27,324
The loving husband,

465
00:19:27,521 --> 00:19:29,857
murdering and eating women
who look like his wife.

466
00:19:30,512 --> 00:19:32,753
It'll probably be
McGee's next bestseller.

467
00:19:33,202 --> 00:19:35,064
It amazes me how the truly sick ones

468
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:36,280
are always the best liked

469
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,944
pillars of the community.

470
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,611
They're successful because
they blend in, Tobias.

471
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,717
They go to church, they
coach Little League baseball.

472
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,022
I was on the team that
nailed Bundy, Gibbs.

473
00:19:45,132 --> 00:19:47,293
And I'm familiar with
sick, charming bastards.

474
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:49,889
That's probably why
we get along so well.

475
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,096
Oh, I found something, boss!

476
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:02,105
Found some bones fragments.

477
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,582
Our serial killer spent
the last five years

478
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,048
getting smoked and tenderized

479
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:22,678
in the Puller High School chimney,

480
00:20:23,278 --> 00:20:25,061
only to fall out during the installation

481
00:20:25,062 --> 00:20:26,140
of the new furnace.

482
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,045
I want to know how he
ended up that way, DiNozzo.

483
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:31,137
Boss, he was a building
inspector for the D.O.D.

484
00:20:31,358 --> 00:20:33,432
When he disappeared in April, 2001,

485
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:34,443
he was checking structures

486
00:20:34,444 --> 00:20:36,274
at Quantico and Little Creek.

487
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,907
Puller High School was on his list.

488
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,051
It could have been an accident.

489
00:20:39,185 --> 00:20:40,587
He could've fallen to his death while

490
00:20:40,588 --> 00:20:41,645
inspecting the school.

491
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:42,238
How?

492
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:43,896
Think about it.

493
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,504
He couldn't just walk
on the military base.

494
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,020
If he drove, they would
have found his car.

495
00:20:47,098 --> 00:20:48,961
A 2000 Honda Accord
disappeared with him.

496
00:20:49,986 --> 00:20:50,996
Fourteen victims,

497
00:20:51,107 --> 00:20:53,829
spread out from 1993 until his death.

498
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:56,093
All of 'em looking
pretty much like his wife.

499
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:57,609
Number 15

500
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,388
found in his own backyard by

501
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:00,469
yours truly,

502
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:02,530
with the FBI digging for more.

503
00:21:02,538 --> 00:21:04,738
Why exactly are we letting
the FBI dig for more?

504
00:21:04,786 --> 00:21:06,435
They're doing our manual labor.

505
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:18,497
Well, this is the last one, Ducky.

506
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:20,113
Unless they find more.

507
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:24,232
Yeah, well, this one's also a female,

508
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,400
judging by the width
of the pelvic bones.

509
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,552
With the almost complete lack of tissue,

510
00:21:30,553 --> 00:21:31,820
I think I'll refrain

511
00:21:31,821 --> 00:21:34,461
before I offer a
tentative time of death.

512
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:36,296
Especially after the last time.

513
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:38,870
Yes, I do deeply apologize for that.

514
00:21:38,947 --> 00:21:39,949
No, problems, Ducky.

515
00:21:40,502 --> 00:21:41,756
We all make mistakes, yes?

516
00:21:41,922 --> 00:21:43,609
Did I ever tell you about the time

517
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,874
I shoved a French police
officer off a cliff?

518
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:47,318
There was a lake below.

519
00:21:47,816 --> 00:21:49,866
Yeah, the man was all right,

520
00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:52,573
but they still issued
a warrant for my arrest.

521
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,500
Gibbs and I managed to keep
two steps ahead of them.

522
00:21:55,871 --> 00:21:57,322
Eventually we escaped across

523
00:21:57,323 --> 00:21:59,145
the English Channel in a sailboat.

524
00:21:59,146 --> 00:22:01,157
You and Agent Gibbs were fugitives?

525
00:22:01,189 --> 00:22:02,752
Yes, for a short while.

526
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,534
Until a young

527
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,178
upcoming NCIS agent
had the charges dropped.

528
00:22:09,312 --> 00:22:09,719
Jenny.

529
00:22:13,604 --> 00:22:14,669
I mean, Director Shepard.

530
00:22:15,897 --> 00:22:18,099
Yeah, she was the one
who commandeered the boat.

531
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:19,903
Director Shepard stole a boat?

532
00:22:20,181 --> 00:22:23,896
She wasn't the director
of NCIS at the time, McGee.

533
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:28,333
Everything's going to be okay.

534
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:30,522
- This is all a big...
- Mrs. Bright,

535
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,937
I need to know how your
husband ended up in Quantico.

536
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,130
He worked at all the bases.

537
00:22:40,357 --> 00:22:42,514
Don't you people understand you have him

538
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:43,994
confused with someone else?

539
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,045
Some kind of monster?

540
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,857
Sweetheart.

541
00:22:50,788 --> 00:22:51,814
Go get your brother, okay.

542
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:52,999
We're going to go to Grandma's house.

543
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:53,924
Go on.

544
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,082
Can't they just leave?

545
00:23:01,164 --> 00:23:03,008
My husband was one
of the most loving men

546
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:04,540
on the planet, Agent Gibbs.

547
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,218
He treated everyone with...

548
00:23:08,103 --> 00:23:09,462
kindness and decency.

549
00:23:10,762 --> 00:23:13,066
Ask anyone who knew
him, Agent Gibbs, anyone.

550
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:16,966
They're removing four
bodies from your backyard.

551
00:23:19,868 --> 00:23:21,126
Do you know how many old, unmarked

552
00:23:21,136 --> 00:23:22,362
graveyards are in Virginia?

553
00:23:24,948 --> 00:23:26,042
When was the last time you saw him?

554
00:23:27,546 --> 00:23:29,706
He was driving to Little Creek.He was...

555
00:23:31,297 --> 00:23:33,140
supposed to call when
he got to his hotel.

556
00:23:33,901 --> 00:23:35,897
That's a long way from
Quantico where he ended up.

557
00:23:36,818 --> 00:23:37,364
I knew.

558
00:23:38,247 --> 00:23:40,073
I knew something was
wrong when he didn't call.

559
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:45,180
You ever have one of those feelings?

560
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,684
When you know something
terrible has just happened?

561
00:23:49,944 --> 00:23:50,405
Once.

562
00:23:55,537 --> 00:23:56,151
And did it?

563
00:24:01,344 --> 00:24:03,340
He didn't do these things, Agent Gibbs.

564
00:24:04,772 --> 00:24:06,399
And I'm sorry, but
there's nothing you people

565
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,809
can do or say to ever
make me believe this.

566
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:27,077
Stashing four bodies in the yard,

567
00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:29,405
that's more than just gloating, Gibbs.

568
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:31,707
Well, they could be his first kills.

569
00:24:32,992 --> 00:24:34,345
I think we're running out of room.

570
00:24:34,575 --> 00:24:38,138
Yes, it won't be lonely
in the Mallard Inn tonight.

571
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,331
How could someone do the
things this man did, Doctor?

572
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:43,625
In some cases, there's
a physiological defect

573
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,866
in the hard-wiring of their brains.

574
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:48,239
A mechanism that precludes

575
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,152
the ability to feel genuine emotion.

576
00:24:51,881 --> 00:24:53,572
Did you find anything
weird in this guy's brain?

577
00:24:53,573 --> 00:24:56,106
Like a tumor or a physical abnormality?

578
00:24:56,403 --> 00:24:57,113
I did not.

579
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:58,779
Then how do you explain him?

580
00:24:59,595 --> 00:25:00,458
I can't.

581
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,424
There is also evil

582
00:25:02,425 --> 00:25:05,127
in this world, and even
armed with all our...

583
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,977
science and degrees,
it remains impenetrable.

584
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:13,055
Perhaps because its
depths are unfathomable.

585
00:25:13,337 --> 00:25:15,265
There's a very good book that I...

586
00:25:17,305 --> 00:25:17,890
Oh.

587
00:25:18,543 --> 00:25:21,000
I seem to have left my bag in the van.

588
00:25:21,405 --> 00:25:22,961
Be a good lad and fetch it for me

589
00:25:22,962 --> 00:25:24,255
before you leave for the night.

590
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,003
You got it, Doctor.

591
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:47,319
Oh.

592
00:26:00,341 --> 00:26:01,848
Thought you might be needing a refill.

593
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:04,518
Thanks.

594
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:08,349
Today certainly brought
back a lot of memories.

595
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:12,506
Yeah.

596
00:26:13,647 --> 00:26:16,480
It also made me realize that

597
00:26:16,768 --> 00:26:20,340
since your return I've been
acting a little like a...

598
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:21,168
An ass?

599
00:26:22,588 --> 00:26:23,883
Well, something like that.

600
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:26,477
I didn't notice.

601
00:26:29,447 --> 00:26:31,233
Yeah, you and I have been through a lot

602
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:32,363
over the years.

603
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,194
Look, I-I... I hate to

604
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:38,433
use marriage as an analogy...

605
00:26:38,434 --> 00:26:39,095
Then don't.

606
00:26:39,466 --> 00:26:42,040
Just tell me what I did to piss you off.

607
00:26:42,652 --> 00:26:43,745
The night you retired,

608
00:26:43,746 --> 00:26:45,628
you asked me to drive you home.

609
00:26:46,402 --> 00:26:49,139
You didn't say a single
word the entire trip.

610
00:26:49,331 --> 00:26:52,599
No explanation, not even a good-bye.

611
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,304
I was kind of still recovering
from the coma, Doctor.

612
00:26:59,992 --> 00:27:01,400
And Kelly and Shannon?

613
00:27:02,198 --> 00:27:04,042
All those years of friendship together,

614
00:27:04,043 --> 00:27:04,862
and somehow you...

615
00:27:05,313 --> 00:27:07,385
failed to mention
that you have a family?

616
00:27:07,404 --> 00:27:07,846
Had.

617
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,381
Had a family.

618
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:19,367
You know how I feel
about apologies, right?

619
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:21,522
Yeah, they're a sign of weakness.

620
00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:23,134
Not between friends.

621
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:25,922
I am sorry, Ducky.

622
00:27:27,668 --> 00:27:28,656
I should have told you.

623
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:33,226
And I should have told
you something months ago.

624
00:27:34,281 --> 00:27:35,026
Welcome home.

625
00:27:39,954 --> 00:27:40,961
Thanks.

626
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,279
Hope you had a better day than I did,

627
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,279
Miss Jeanne Benoit.

628
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,553
I've been thinking a
lot about you lately...

629
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:07,215
and I'm really, really
trying to figure out a way

630
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:09,991
to not screw this up.

631
00:28:20,748 --> 00:28:21,391
Tony.

632
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:23,278
Hey. I thought you were sleeping.

633
00:28:23,642 --> 00:28:24,467
I was.

634
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:28,551
So...

635
00:28:30,066 --> 00:28:30,824
how was your day?

636
00:28:32,075 --> 00:28:32,717
Well...

637
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,935
<i>you ever see The Texas
Chainsaw Massacre?</i>

638
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,740
Original or remake?

639
00:28:38,764 --> 00:28:39,234
Either.

640
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,240
Neither.

641
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:42,851
It was a lot like that,...

642
00:28:43,964 --> 00:28:44,674
but worse.

643
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:46,816
How about you?

644
00:28:47,344 --> 00:28:49,003
Kind of like a cross between...

645
00:28:49,825 --> 00:28:51,164
<i>Trains, Planes and Automobiles</i>

646
00:28:51,165 --> 00:28:52,556
<i>and The Muppets Take Manhattan.</i>

647
00:28:53,584 --> 00:28:54,713
That is a heady,

648
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:57,841
heady brew of strange
cinematic references,

649
00:28:57,842 --> 00:28:59,146
and I don't know what to make of it.

650
00:29:00,342 --> 00:29:02,303
I interned at the Children's Ward today.

651
00:29:02,917 --> 00:29:04,560
- Ah...
- I felt kind of like that, too.

652
00:29:06,335 --> 00:29:07,736
Beautiful and clever.

653
00:29:08,858 --> 00:29:10,051
So why aren't you kissing me?

654
00:29:11,595 --> 00:29:12,929
And she's a mind reader.

655
00:29:13,245 --> 00:29:14,595
Not exactly. Stop...

656
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:03,990
Are you on medication?

657
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:05,611
Just had a good night last night.

658
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:06,667
Doing what?

659
00:30:08,294 --> 00:30:09,129
The usual.

660
00:30:09,628 --> 00:30:10,638
The usual what?

661
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:11,770
Night.

662
00:30:17,763 --> 00:30:19,125
You had sex, didn't you?

663
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:19,825
What?

664
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,740
It's okay to admit it.

665
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,500
I mean, we're all adults here.

666
00:30:24,078 --> 00:30:26,553
That's a subject I'd be willing
to debate, Officer David.

667
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:28,540
Where's Gibbs?

668
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,978
Well, he must have
known you were coming,

669
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:32,517
because he's not here.

670
00:30:33,451 --> 00:30:35,935
It was really more of a
courtesy call, DiNozzo,

671
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:39,600
letting him know about
these orders from Justice

672
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,245
the ones where the FBI

673
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:44,812
is taking over your case.

674
00:30:47,633 --> 00:30:48,707
You sure he's not around?

675
00:30:50,626 --> 00:30:53,357
These are pretty clear-cut
orders, Agent Fornell.

676
00:30:53,689 --> 00:30:56,132
"And NCIS is hereby ordered to turn over

677
00:30:56,244 --> 00:30:59,566
full jurisdiction of the
Bright case to the FBI"

678
00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:02,444
by end of business today."

679
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:06,232
Who did you have to
sleep with to get these?

680
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:07,317
Director, please.

681
00:31:08,421 --> 00:31:11,577
A serial killer falls down
a chimney on a Marine base.

682
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:13,917
Is that a logical way
to decide jurisdiction?

683
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,667
It's been working for
us since around 1882.

684
00:31:17,147 --> 00:31:17,700
Sadly,

685
00:31:18,122 --> 00:31:19,331
Justice doesn't see it that way.

686
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:23,140
The FBI's invested 12
years in this investigation.

687
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,985
And my people made more progress

688
00:31:24,986 --> 00:31:26,691
in just three days.Now, I can see

689
00:31:26,692 --> 00:31:27,793
how that would be embarrassing.

690
00:31:28,174 --> 00:31:28,798
I'll get over it.

691
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,998
No hard feelings, Jethro?

692
00:31:32,734 --> 00:31:33,067
No.

693
00:31:34,189 --> 00:31:35,913
Just need you to look at
something before you leave.

694
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:38,087
You got that mustache
in a box, don't you?

695
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,886
It took more time than I care to admit,

696
00:31:43,056 --> 00:31:46,109
but I finally managed
to solve the riddle

697
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,048
of how our friend died.

698
00:31:49,017 --> 00:31:49,816
You may need this.

699
00:31:50,766 --> 00:31:51,658
Look closely.

700
00:31:52,272 --> 00:31:54,591
In the area of his abdomen,

701
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:58,575
do you see anything resembling wounds?

702
00:32:01,188 --> 00:32:01,640
No.

703
00:32:01,738 --> 00:32:04,462
No, neither did I, until
I took a second look

704
00:32:04,663 --> 00:32:05,767
at the CAT scan.

705
00:32:06,035 --> 00:32:08,619
You see, smoking desiccates flesh,

706
00:32:08,849 --> 00:32:10,256
which is why it is the

707
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,100
preferred method of preserving meat

708
00:32:12,116 --> 00:32:14,400
in less technologically advanced

709
00:32:14,424 --> 00:32:15,334
- societies...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

710
00:32:16,152 --> 00:32:17,191
How did he die, Doctor?

711
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:19,200
Well, as the moisture was lost,

712
00:32:19,353 --> 00:32:20,398
the victim's tissue,

713
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,885
which protected the
vital organs, shrank.

714
00:32:23,874 --> 00:32:25,674
You see these little black dots?

715
00:32:32,926 --> 00:32:33,514
oh, yeah.

716
00:32:34,308 --> 00:32:37,285
He was stabbed repeatedly and fatally.

717
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:39,647
With what?

718
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,841
A safety pin?

719
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:43,578
No, as I just explained,

720
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:46,114
the shrinkage of the flesh is deceptive.

721
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:48,847
Most likely it was an ice pick or a...

722
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:50,979
Phillips-head screwdriver.

723
00:32:51,307 --> 00:32:53,280
Somebody killed your
serial killer, Fornell.

724
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:55,036
On a Marine base...

725
00:32:55,287 --> 00:32:56,341
which means...

726
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:59,204
it is still our jurisdiction.

727
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:16,447
I've seen a lot of things
since I became a cop, Ziva,

728
00:33:17,174 --> 00:33:17,741
But this...

729
00:33:18,471 --> 00:33:20,426
a guy tortures and murders 19 women

730
00:33:20,427 --> 00:33:22,464
and then gets off on eating their toes?

731
00:33:23,157 --> 00:33:24,937
Whoever whacked this sick freak

732
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:26,682
did us and the world a favor.

733
00:33:26,863 --> 00:33:28,365
And our job is to arrest them.

734
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:29,761
Makes perfect sense to me.

735
00:33:30,084 --> 00:33:32,141
Justified or not, still a crime, Ziva.

736
00:33:32,932 --> 00:33:33,530
In this country,

737
00:33:33,531 --> 00:33:35,472
you cannot take the
law into your own hands.

738
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:37,707
Unless it's your little
sister wanted for murder,

739
00:33:38,173 --> 00:33:38,645
right, Probie?

740
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:39,739
You know what I mean.

741
00:33:40,793 --> 00:33:41,797
What if this was your sister?

742
00:33:42,857 --> 00:33:43,282
Or her?

743
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,282
My point is that we cannot just

744
00:33:45,283 --> 00:33:47,061
investigate the crimes that we want to.

745
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:48,072
McGee's right.

746
00:33:48,371 --> 00:33:49,905
Does anybody have a problem with that?

747
00:33:50,054 --> 00:33:51,279
No, boss, it's just...

748
00:33:51,673 --> 00:33:52,990
Just what, DiNozzo?

749
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,387
Some days this job really sucks.

750
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:57,177
Yeah? Well, it's about to get worse.

751
00:33:58,144 --> 00:34:00,832
Ziva, you and Tony are
with Sacks on this one.

752
00:34:00,871 --> 00:34:01,593
Doing what?

753
00:34:02,065 --> 00:34:04,607
Coming up with a list of
people who wanted Bright dead.

754
00:34:04,727 --> 00:34:05,923
Besides everyone in this room?

755
00:34:06,037 --> 00:34:07,712
Except for McLawyer over there.

756
00:34:07,775 --> 00:34:08,994
Tony, all I was saying...

757
00:34:08,995 --> 00:34:11,106
Go check on Abby, see
if she needs any help.

758
00:34:12,772 --> 00:34:14,807
Running a little late
today, are we, Tobias?

759
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:16,315
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

760
00:34:16,316 --> 00:34:18,287
Oh, only slightly more than a lot.

761
00:34:18,553 --> 00:34:18,962
Come on.

762
00:34:19,402 --> 00:34:19,945
What?

763
00:34:20,189 --> 00:34:21,506
Ducky's got something for us.

764
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:24,092
There wasn't any recoverable tissue

765
00:34:24,116 --> 00:34:25,390
from any of the remains.

766
00:34:25,693 --> 00:34:28,780
All four bodies were
completely stripped to the bone.

767
00:34:28,812 --> 00:34:30,510
Yeah, I can see that, Duck.

768
00:34:30,841 --> 00:34:31,977
How long were they on the ground?

769
00:34:32,284 --> 00:34:33,322
Shallow graves,

770
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:34,715
exposed to the elements,

771
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:37,344
all four women could
have been there for,

772
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,607
ooh, decades or for as
little as six months.

773
00:34:40,635 --> 00:34:42,381
We know it's got to
be at least five years.

774
00:34:42,405 --> 00:34:44,086
Do we, Tobias?

775
00:34:44,745 --> 00:34:47,289
Yes, unless Bright figured out a way to

776
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,926
climb in and out of that smokestack.

777
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:50,977
For what it's worth, I agree with you,

778
00:34:50,978 --> 00:34:52,601
but down here, we deal in facts.

779
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,663
Meaning you don't know?

780
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,153
Well, not yet.

781
00:34:55,411 --> 00:34:56,732
Couldn't have told me
that on the phone, Duck?

782
00:34:57,098 --> 00:34:58,828
Yes, I could have, Jethro, but

783
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:00,905
that's not the reason
I asked you down here.

784
00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:05,737
I took the liberty of
reviewing the profile

785
00:35:05,738 --> 00:35:07,520
that the FBI prepared

786
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:10,414
on our serial killer eight years ago.

787
00:35:10,572 --> 00:35:13,118
In order to disguise
his predatory nature,

788
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,442
Bright had to be methodical, precise,

789
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:17,853
cautious almost to a fault.

790
00:35:18,388 --> 00:35:19,002
Your point?

791
00:35:19,849 --> 00:35:22,277
Well, if the FBI's finest
couldn't get to him,

792
00:35:22,938 --> 00:35:24,415
it makes me wonder who did.

793
00:35:24,798 --> 00:35:25,607
He knew his killer.

794
00:35:27,534 --> 00:35:28,677
That's good work, Ducky.

795
00:35:30,243 --> 00:35:32,622
How else could someone
get close enough to him

796
00:35:32,623 --> 00:35:35,130
to stab him to death
with a screwdriver?!

797
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:36,707
- DiNozzo?
- Yeah, boss?

798
00:35:36,787 --> 00:35:38,247
Concentrate on the high school.

799
00:35:38,288 --> 00:35:39,166
Someone there had to have

800
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:40,533
a personal connection to Bright.

801
00:35:40,628 --> 00:35:41,753
- On it.
- Find him.

802
00:35:43,418 --> 00:35:45,084
I'm a forensic scientist, McGee.

803
00:35:45,367 --> 00:35:46,856
I don't need anyone checking up on me.

804
00:35:46,857 --> 00:35:49,126
What I do need is to date those bones.

805
00:35:49,394 --> 00:35:51,657
The ones that we found
in Beef Jerky's backyard.

806
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:52,747
"Marty"?

807
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:54,965
Yes!

808
00:35:55,177 --> 00:35:56,223
Why didn't I think of that?

809
00:35:56,968 --> 00:36:00,588
Marty got his degree in
forensic botany at Penn State.

810
00:36:01,524 --> 00:36:03,520
The roots grew into the bones.

811
00:36:03,843 --> 00:36:05,744
So if Marty can I.D. the plant,

812
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:07,801
he can probably give us a rough estimate

813
00:36:07,802 --> 00:36:09,073
as to when they were buried.

814
00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:10,969
Way to go, McGee!

815
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,259
How did you know what Marty majored in?

816
00:36:18,382 --> 00:36:19,090
I didn't.

817
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:20,685
Who is he?

818
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,399
He's...

819
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,153
just a friend.

820
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:27,361
"Being with you makes me believe

821
00:36:27,362 --> 00:36:30,002
size truly doesn't matter. Abby."

822
00:36:31,195 --> 00:36:32,908
Okay, he's a really good friend.

823
00:36:36,872 --> 00:36:39,169
Where the hell did
you learn how to type?

824
00:36:39,295 --> 00:36:39,853
Do you mind?

825
00:36:39,955 --> 00:36:41,855
Your breath's taking the
starch out of my collar.

826
00:36:42,854 --> 00:36:43,554
- What've we got?
- What've we got?

827
00:36:43,864 --> 00:36:45,437
Um, the teaching staff still present

828
00:36:45,438 --> 00:36:47,835
from five years ago all claim
not to have known Bright.

829
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:48,961
Well, if they murdered
the guy and stuffed

830
00:36:48,962 --> 00:36:50,815
him down a chimney,
that's not surprising.

831
00:36:50,867 --> 00:36:51,244
Tony?

832
00:36:51,632 --> 00:36:52,873
Running down a list of substitutes

833
00:36:52,874 --> 00:36:53,928
who used to teach back then.

834
00:36:54,023 --> 00:36:55,625
His wife's a teacher, third grade.

835
00:36:55,626 --> 00:36:56,742
See if she ever worked at Puller.

836
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,186
We checked for Brights
already, boss. There are none.

837
00:36:59,603 --> 00:37:00,364
Check her maiden name.

838
00:37:00,687 --> 00:37:02,258
Her maiden name is Burris, Tony.

839
00:37:02,734 --> 00:37:04,205
Burris...

840
00:37:07,447 --> 00:37:09,193
Okay, got one hit: Karen Burris.

841
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:12,062
Subbed for social studies
and Western history in 2001.

842
00:37:12,111 --> 00:37:13,495
Social security number listed

843
00:37:13,496 --> 00:37:14,927
is the same as Bright's wife.

844
00:37:25,436 --> 00:37:26,477
My mama always told me

845
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:28,348
big things come in small packages.

846
00:37:28,962 --> 00:37:29,947
What a coincidence.

847
00:37:30,273 --> 00:37:32,557
Mine always warned me about
tattooed girls bearing...

848
00:37:32,737 --> 00:37:33,552
samples.

849
00:37:34,058 --> 00:37:35,567
I'm talking about your lab.

850
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,707
I love it.

851
00:37:37,195 --> 00:37:37,553
Yeah?

852
00:37:38,324 --> 00:37:39,315
Pretty sweet, huh?

853
00:37:39,861 --> 00:37:41,057
Sweet!

854
00:37:41,702 --> 00:37:43,894
I'd kill for half this equipment.

855
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:44,569
Really?

856
00:37:45,662 --> 00:37:46,840
What would you do for all of it?

857
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:52,780
What's your crazy
ninja sense telling you?

858
00:37:53,185 --> 00:37:53,907
She's scared.

859
00:37:54,394 --> 00:37:56,413
I mean, about whether
she shanked Beef Jerky

860
00:37:56,414 --> 00:37:57,979
and dropped him down the wishing well.

861
00:37:58,881 --> 00:37:59,768
What would you do if

862
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:01,452
you woke up one day and you discovered

863
00:38:01,562 --> 00:38:02,945
you were married to a monster?

864
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,477
Happened to my father all the time.

865
00:38:04,478 --> 00:38:05,491
We usually just moved.

866
00:38:05,747 --> 00:38:07,099
Ah, that explains it.

867
00:38:16,105 --> 00:38:17,439
Karen, you were a substitute

868
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,875
at Lieutenant General
Lewis Puller High School.

869
00:38:21,058 --> 00:38:23,497
I- I've worked a lot
of schools in the area.

870
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:25,186
What does that have to do with this?

871
00:38:25,485 --> 00:38:27,399
Considering we found your husband

872
00:38:27,693 --> 00:38:29,161
petrified in the chimney there,

873
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:30,877
quite a bit.

874
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:32,449
Karen...

875
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:36,895
we know this is hard...

876
00:38:40,171 --> 00:38:41,005
but we're here to help.

877
00:38:44,016 --> 00:38:46,639
It's important that
you tell us the truth.

878
00:38:52,037 --> 00:38:52,917
When'd you find out?

879
00:38:55,004 --> 00:38:55,806
Find out?

880
00:38:58,091 --> 00:38:59,710
That your loving husband

881
00:39:00,913 --> 00:39:02,211
was murdering women

882
00:39:03,271 --> 00:39:04,584
who looked just like you?

883
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:08,135
I told you,

884
00:39:08,776 --> 00:39:10,688
my husband didn't do those things.

885
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:14,088
He removed the toes
from their left feet.

886
00:39:15,973 --> 00:39:17,421
We think that you know why.

887
00:39:19,783 --> 00:39:20,825
You mind taking off your shoe

888
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:22,128
and showing us your left foot?

889
00:39:23,908 --> 00:39:24,765
Please.

890
00:39:27,253 --> 00:39:27,819
Karen?

891
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,023
Your husband was an evil man.

892
00:39:50,094 --> 00:39:51,868
That thing was not my husband.

893
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,907
It wasn't the man I married.

894
00:39:56,573 --> 00:39:58,301
It had to be stopped, don't you see?

895
00:39:58,302 --> 00:39:59,608
I had no other choice!

896
00:39:59,936 --> 00:40:01,467
Yeah, you could have gone to the police.

897
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:03,855
And have my children live
the rest of their lives

898
00:40:03,863 --> 00:40:06,352
knowing that monster
was their father? No!

899
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:10,289
I had to. I had to protect them from it.

900
00:40:15,074 --> 00:40:16,600
<i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>

901
00:40:17,538 --> 00:40:18,371
evergreen shrub,

902
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:20,782
more commonly known as
wintergreen or checkerberry.

903
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:22,897
We need to see the photo where

904
00:40:22,898 --> 00:40:24,198
the sample was recovered from.

905
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:27,232
It was taken from between
the fibula and the tibia.

906
00:40:27,586 --> 00:40:28,707
Go back to the wide shot.

907
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:31,558
No..Go to that quadrant.

908
00:40:32,706 --> 00:40:33,640
That's your wintergreen,

909
00:40:33,896 --> 00:40:35,181
about five meters from the remains.

910
00:40:35,665 --> 00:40:37,335
Judging from the thickness of the root,

911
00:40:37,731 --> 00:40:38,917
annual growth rate

912
00:40:39,414 --> 00:40:41,042
and the soil samples you brought me,

913
00:40:41,993 --> 00:40:43,121
we can calculate roughly

914
00:40:43,122 --> 00:40:44,506
how long the body's been buried,

915
00:40:45,256 --> 00:40:46,545
plus or minus six months.

916
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:49,124
You can tell it was a live sample

917
00:40:49,215 --> 00:40:51,582
by the tiny little offshoots
forming off the main root.

918
00:40:52,293 --> 00:40:52,966
Want to see?

919
00:40:57,045 --> 00:40:57,527
Abby?

920
00:40:58,817 --> 00:41:00,061
In her position, I can't say

921
00:41:00,062 --> 00:41:01,632
I wouldn't have done
the same thing, Tony.

922
00:41:02,923 --> 00:41:03,807
McGee was right,

923
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:06,217
about taking the law
into your own hands.

924
00:41:07,774 --> 00:41:09,977
She's lucky she wasn't his last victim.

925
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:21,491
Karen...

926
00:41:22,286 --> 00:41:25,152
no one should have to
live through what you did.

927
00:41:25,801 --> 00:41:27,230
Believe me when I tell you that...

928
00:41:27,915 --> 00:41:29,492
there's no jury in the world

929
00:41:29,706 --> 00:41:31,091
that wouldn't sympathize with you.

930
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:36,682
It's not me.

931
00:41:44,698 --> 00:41:45,247
What?

932
00:41:45,781 --> 00:41:47,174
What do you want to bet that's McGeek?

933
00:41:47,525 --> 00:41:48,462
Rule number 22:

934
00:41:48,463 --> 00:41:51,064
Never, ever bother
Gibbs in interrogation.

935
00:41:57,591 --> 00:41:59,007
Tony, I don't think it's McGee.

936
00:42:00,336 --> 00:42:01,547
Got it, Abbs, thanks.

937
00:42:04,123 --> 00:42:05,041
You okay, Karen?

938
00:42:05,164 --> 00:42:06,347
You're gonna get through this.

939
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,236
Get away from her, Tobias.

940
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:17,277
The bodies in the yard are
not from five years ago.

941
00:42:17,546 --> 00:42:18,141
They're older?

942
00:42:19,096 --> 00:42:19,409
No.

943
00:42:21,494 --> 00:42:22,512
They're more recent than that.

944
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:28,059
Her husband wasn't the serial killer.

945
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:32,876
She is.

946
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:44,091
I got to tell you, Jethro, that was...

947
00:42:47,949 --> 00:42:48,950
that was...

948
00:42:52,234 --> 00:42:54,055
How in God's name could
we have missed that?

949
00:42:56,017 --> 00:42:58,160
I don't think God had
much to do with it, Tobias.

950
00:42:58,213 --> 00:42:59,556
You know what's really
got me freaked out?

951
00:43:00,275 --> 00:43:01,911
If her husband's body
hadn't gotten hung up

952
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,606
going down that chimney five years ago,

953
00:43:04,631 --> 00:43:05,725
she'd still be out there.

954
00:43:07,313 --> 00:43:08,239
We'd never have caught her.

955
00:43:10,576 --> 00:43:11,861
I can do you one better than that.

956
00:43:12,554 --> 00:43:14,482
No, can't top that, Jethro.

957
00:43:15,209 --> 00:43:17,608
What was a toe doing in
her husband's stomach?
