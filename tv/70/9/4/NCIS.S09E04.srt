我不知道军方需要什么

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,170
这是先生们应该关心的问题

There's this 18-year-old kid,he's on dialysis,and he needs a kidney,

33
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,940
他家里没人匹配的上 那我不能不见义勇为咯

So I went down to the hospital and got tested,and they just called me.

You're going to give a perfectly good kidney to a total stranger?

00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,920
还有个家伙
There's also a guy.

132
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,990
真的?
Really?

133
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,860
一般能找到一个匹配者就很难
Well,usually it's hard to find one donor that's a match.

134
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,910
是的 没错
Yeah,exactly.

135
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,100
所以她很吃惊有两兄妹同时愿意
That's why she was amazed that she found a brother and a sister both willing to donate.

136
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,740
你弟也是自愿的?
Your brother also volunteered?

137
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,830
不是 我跟Luca谈过了
No. I spoke to Luca.

138
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,280
他什么都不知道
He doesn't know anything about it.

139
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,080
我有点糊涂了
I'm confused.

140
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,950
为什么器官捐赠联络员认为 你和那男的是兄妹?
Why does the transplant coordinator think that you and this man are siblings?

141
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,300
在筛选过程中 我们要提供线粒体DNA样本
As part of the screening process,we had to give a mitochondrial DNA sample.

142
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,850
我们俩的完全匹配 Ducky
Ours was a dead-on match,Ducky.

143
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,420
匹配率大于99.9%
More than 99.9%.

144
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,420
我们是绝对的亲兄妹 对吧?
I mean,we have to be full-on brother and sister,right?

145
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,390
我联系联络员想要他的详细资料 --像名字和地址之类
I-I pressed the coordinator for details on the guy-- like his name and address,

146
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,820
但她拒绝了 说她已经说了太多
but she clammed up,saying she'd said too much already.

147
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,730
所有捐赠者的医疗和个人信息都 必须按规定保密
It's pro forma for all donors' medical and personal records to be kept confidential.

148
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:36,440
难道是我父母还有个小孩被人领养?
Could my parents have had another child they gave up for adoption?

149
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,170
这事讲不通啊
I mean,it doesn't make any sense.

150
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,630
我不信 我弟弟Luca也不信
I don't believe it.And neither does my little brother Luca.

151
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,600
他跟我一样吃惊
He's as blown away as I am.

152
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,820
你父母都去世了 还有其他人可以打听么?
With your parents deceased,isn't there anyone else you can ask?

153
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,690
谢谢你
Thanks for listening.

154
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,260
我们应该等Gibbs一起
I think we should have waited for Gibbs.

155
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,130
没时间了
No time.

156
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,730
Sportelli说他清醒了
Sportelli said he was conscious.

157
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,390
不知道醒了多久了 听着 等下我们进去 你别说话
We don't know for how long.Now,listen,when we get into the room,you let me do the talking.

158
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,970
为什么?
Why?

159
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,970
The Cooler逃避FBI的追捕很多年了
The Cooler's evaded the FBI for years.

160
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,610
得有妙招才能让他说出谁想杀Brett中校
Getting him to tell us who took out the hit on Commander Brett is going to take a deft hand.

161
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,120
你能行?
Oh,and that's you?

162
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,730
我告诉你前 你甚至不知道冷冻杀手是什么
You didn't even know who The Cooler was until I told you.

163
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,780
Ziva也不知道
Neither did Ziva.

164
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,990
不 我需要跟Arliss单独谈谈 所以你得把Sportelli拦在外头
No,I need to talk to Arliss alone,so you've got to get Sportelli out of the room.

165
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,410
我要怎么做啊?
And how am I supposed to do that?

166
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,110
不知道--反正分散他的注意力
Well,I don't know-- you distract him.

167
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,080
讲讲你对喷气发动机组件的痴迷-- 就是把人困在火箭里的那玩意
Talk about your stupid obsession with jet packs-- men strapped to rockets.

168
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,970
我那才不是痴迷
Hey,I am not obsessed.

169
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,640
特别探员们
Special agents.

170
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,730
伙计们 你们不能跟Arliss谈话
You're not going to get to talk to Arliss,boys.

171
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,860
- 你说我们可以 - 他心跳停了
- You said we could. - He flatlined.

172
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:40,410
- 死了? - 没错
- He's dead? - Over and out.

173
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,000
难以置信这家伙是个声名狼藉的杀手
Hard to believe this guy was an infamous killer.

174
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,180
到昨天为止 他唯一的荣誉就是 作为厂商代表获得
Up until yesterday,his only claim to fame was salesman of the year

175
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,200
一家家具公司的年度杰出业务员
as a manufacturer's rep for a furniture company.

176
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,790
他有老婆和两个孩子 无犯罪记录 连张停车罚单也没有
He's got a wife,two kids,no criminal record.Not even a parking ticket.

177
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,760
他隐匿的很好 逃避FBI好多年了
He evaded the FBI for years by hiding in plain sight.

178
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,030
- 挺怪的 你还不得不佩服这家伙... - 他杀人如麻
- In a weird way,you got to admire the guy... - He's a mass murderer.

179
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,040
卑鄙之极
Despicable.

180
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,130
没什么好佩服的
Nothing to admire.

181
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,840
你有没有找到Arliss跟 认识Brett中校的人之间的联系?
Did you connect Arliss to anyone who knows Commander Brett?

182
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,000
还没 当地警察已经派人去查他家
not yet .Metro's got a team going through his house.

183
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,200
我要是能审问他 不是我吹
If only I could have interrogated him,I tell ya.

184
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,010
不出5分钟 我就能让他乖乖吐出 那凶手的名字
Five minutes in my magic hands and I would have had him coughing up the name of that hit man.

185
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,040
- 5分钟? - 没错 因为我是跟最强的人学习
- Five minutes? - Five minutes,because I learned from the best.

186
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,550
我们得找出背后黑手
We need to find out who hired him.

187
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,770
我在找他的仇人
I've been looking for enemies.

188
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:31,730
不过Brett中校是个战功赫赫的英雄 大家都喜欢他
But Commander Brett is a decorated hero.He's well-liked.

189
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,370
他的前指挥官说Brett挤进国会时 曾踩过某些人
Spoke to his former C.O. Brett climbed over some people while angling for his plum assignment on the Hill,

190
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,300
不过这位置他确实应得
but no one denies he deserved it.

191
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,220
当他挤进国会时? 谁讲话会这样?
While angling for his plum assignment on the Hill?Who talks like that?

192
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,160
我已经迟到5分钟了
I'm already five minutes late.

193
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,790
你平时都这么忙?
Is your day always this busy?

194
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,210
有时候更忙
Some are worse.

195
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,840
特别是有投票的时候
Especially when there's a big vote.

196
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,720
这是第一次一位武装女性陪同我
It's the first time I've ever been accompanied by a woman who's packing.

197
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,320
- 武装? - 带着枪
- Packing? - Carrying a gun.

198
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,180
像你这样的人怎么会做NCIS的探员?
Why does someone who looks like you become an NCIS agent?

199
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,800
那探员应该长什么样?
What are agents supposed to look like?

200
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,480
严肃 傲慢 无趣
Stern,surly,humorless.

201
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,510
比如探员Gibbs
Agent Gibbs.

202
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,940
你们的问题是绷得太紧了
The problem with you guys is you're too uptight.

203
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,110
放轻松点
Try lightening up a little.

204
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,760
探员Ziva 没事 我认识他 没事
Agent Ziva,relax.I know him.Relax.

205
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,950
抱歉 Nick
Sorry,Nick.

206
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,010
- 你还好吗? - 是 不!
- You okay? - Yeah.No!

207
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,110
这到底怎么回事?
What the hell is going on?

208
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,330
Nick 这是NCIS特别探员Ziva David
Nick,NCIS Special Agent Ziva David.

209
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,600
- NCIS? - 他们误以为我需要保护
- NCIS? - They mistakenly believe I need protection.

210
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,590
其实真没什么事
It's nothing really.

211
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,560
你刚刚粗暴对待了一名K大街的大亨
You just roughed up one of the barons of K Street.

212
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,780
他是说得好听点 其实我就是个说客
He's trying to avoid using the pejorative.I'm a lobbyist.

213
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,550
你今天下午稍后会在办公室吗? 我有事要跟你谈
Listen,are you going to be in your office later this afternoon?I need to talk to you about something.

214
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,980
好的 我4点左右回来

谢谢你的"小心翼翼"
Thanks for being so discreet.

217
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,750
DiNozzo这是在搞什么?
What the hell's DiNozzo doing?

218
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,080
不知道
I don't know.

219
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,740
你确定Arliss的老婆没问题么?
Are you sure about Arliss' wife?

220
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,850
她以为当时他在路上卖家具呢
She thought he was on the road,selling furniture.

221
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,220
随便你 跟她谈也好 四处看看也行
Be my guest.Talk to her. Look around.

222
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,260
不过最好快点
Better move fast.

223
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,960
FBI马上就来
FBI's on their way.

00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,390
他们会接管一切
They're taking over.

225
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,860
我讨厌这些家伙
Hate those guys.

226
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,080
都是些钓名沽誉的
Glory hounds.

227
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,830
比起局里 我还是喜欢跟你打交道
I'd rather deal with you than the Bureau.

228
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:24,900
我刚可不是说你
I don't blame you.

229
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,910
老大!
Hey,boss!

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,050
这儿有问题 我步测过车库的内外
Something's wrong here.I paced off the inside and outside of the garage.

231
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,710
相差几英尺
There's a couple feet missing.

232
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,430
这堵墙后有电源
Looks like there's some electrical power going behind this wall.

233
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,290
听起来是空的
Sounds hollow.

234
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,210
里面有东西
There's something back here.

235
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,680
这儿有条缝
There's a seam.

236
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,650
有意思
That's interesting.

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,550
找到了
Eureka.

238

<i>Yeah,our people are real good.</i>

243

244
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,740
当然 没问题
Yeah,sure.

245
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,460
不 跟赌金没有任何关系
No,this doesn't have anything to do with a sweepstakes.

246
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,000

What're you doing?

249
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,240
我在Arliss的电脑里发现了线索
I found something on Arliss' computer.

250
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,110
我要复制他的硬盘 你有3口的USB集线器吗?
I need to clone his hard drive.Do you have your USB-3 cable?

We're looking for a client of yours,George Kaplan.

394
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,620
你知道哪里能找到他吗?
Do you know where we can find him?

395
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,280
呃 你们去过他的公寓没?
Uh,you check his apartment?

396
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,620
去过了 呃 也许他出城了 他好像经常到处跑
Yes. Okay,uh... maybe he's out of town.He seems to move around a lot.

397
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,070
自从上次税季我就没见过他了
I haven't seen him since last tax season.

398
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,340
- 你能描述一下他的外貌吗? - George?
- Can you describe him? - George?

399
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,600
呃 不高 174左右
Yeah,um,on the shorter side,five-eight maybe.

400
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,070
黑发
Dark hair.

401
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,670
我真的不太了解他
I don't really know him that well.

402
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,950
我是说 我只是帮他处理投资帐户 一年做一次报税
I mean,I just helped him set up an investment account and do his taxes once a year.

403
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,010
这到底是怎么回事?
What is this about?

404
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,840
你认识一个海军少校叫 Geoffrey Brett的吗?
Do you know a Lieutenant Commander named Geoffrey Brett?

405
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,500
不认识 对不起
No. Sorry.

406
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,020
我得走了
And I gotta get going.

407
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,710
我的客户正在国税局办公室里 这会让他过度呼吸而昏阙的
I mean,my client is at at the IRS office and he is hyperventilating.

408
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,570
我们需要你来海军基地一趟 给Kaplan画个素描
Well,we just need you to come by the Navy Yard and help us with a sketch of Kaplan.

409
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,950
你也在那儿吗?
Are you gonna be there?

410
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,520
当然
Definitely.

411
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,730
你会跟我们的法证科学家 Abby Sciuto一起合作
You'll be working with our forensic scientist Abby Sciuto.

412
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,580
都行
Whatever.

413
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,130
一结束国税局的事情我就过去 大概一个 或者最多两个小时?
I mean,I'll be there as soon as I'm done with the IRS; let's say an hour,two at the most?

414
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,510
那不错 谢谢
Sounds good.Thanks.

415
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,140
我到底有多大麻烦?
How much trouble am I in?

416
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,060
你不把对你生命的威胁当回事
You're not taking the threat on your life seriously.

417
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,910
没错 我是不当一回事 完全是乌龙嘛
You're right,I'm not.It's bogus.

418
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,320
你是一个专业杀手的目标
a professional hit man is targeting you.

419
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,670
你无凭无据
You have no basis.

420
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,330
我没法想象 我身边有谁恨我恨成这样
I can't,for the life of me,think of anyone I've pissed off that bad.

421
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,130
你为什么甩了我
Why'd you ditch me?

422
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,460
好吧 这太古怪了
Okay,this is awkward.

423
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,200
- 要听真话? - 那敢情好
- The truth? - That would be nice.

424
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,800
整天开会你都跟着我 我觉得很不舒服
I was uncomfortable having you with me in meetings all day,

425
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,150
但是昨晚决不能让你还跟着我
but there was no way I could let you accompany me last night.

426
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,990
- 我跟一个女人在一起 - 已婚的?
- I was with a woman. - She married?

427
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,070
不 她没有嫉妒心强的前男友 相信我 我想过这个
No,and no jealous ex-boyfriends.Trust me,I thought of that.

428
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,820
你们俩根本不懂 我自己也有生活的
You two don't get it.I've got a life to live.

429
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,870
如果有人要杀我 我能自己处理好
And if anyone's trying to kill me,I can take care of myself.

430
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,490
我真高兴这不是我的活
I'm glad this is your detail and not mine.

431
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,430
继续
Go on.

432
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:22,070
- 有什么发现 Abbs - 哦 Gibbs 你吓了我一跳
- What do you got,Abbs? - Whoa,Gibbs,you scared me.

433
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,790
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

434
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,570
呃 我在查路易斯安那州Jefferson Parish 所有的男性出生记录
Um,I'm searching male birth records from Jefferson Parish,Louisiana.

435
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,930
找到啥了?
You find anything?

436
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,010
没有
No.

437
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,790
Kaplan公寓里的指纹有发现吗?
How'd you make out with the prints found in Kaplan's apartment?

438
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,130
呃 我还没处理
Um,I haven't gotten to them yet.

439
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,680
那Kaplan的素描呢?
What about the computer sketch of Kaplan?

440
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,330
他的业务经理没来
His business manager never showed up.

441
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,390
你告诉Tony和McGee了吗?
Did you tell Tony,McGee?

442
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:45,670
- 没有 我无法集中精力 Gibbs - Abbs
- No. I've been a little distracted,Gibbs. - Abbs.

443
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,530
我需要你
I need you.

444
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,570
非常感谢
I appreciate it.

445
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,320
经纪人说他收到Drew Turner的电话 那个火辣性感的会计师
Broker said he got a call from Drew Turner,the hot,sexy accountant,

446
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:04,050
是上礼拜的事 授权把Kaplan帐户的钱 转往哥斯达黎加
last week,authorizing the money transfer to Costa Rica from Kaplan's account.

447
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,080
她告诉我们她自从上个税季就没有 跟Kaplan联系过
She told us she hadn't spoken to Kaplan since last tax season.

448
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,010
她在撒谎
She lied.

449
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,030
哦 我猜你不会请她帮你报税的
Well,I guess she won't be doing your taxes.

450
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,260
我打给Gibbs
I'm going to call Gibbs.

451
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,480
等一下 菜鸟
Hold it,probie.

452
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,460
是我拿到经纪人资料的传票的
I'm the one who subpoenaed the brokerage papers.

453
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,260
对 但是是我追踪钱转到赌博网站的
Uh,yeah,but I'm the one that traced the transfer to the gambling Web site.

454
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,820
- 老大 是我 - 不 是我
- Boss,that's me. - No,actually,that was me.

455
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,560
我拿到Kaplan的经纪状况了
I got Kaplan's brokerage statement.

456
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:38,490
在两万五美刀转入杀手的帐户一个礼拜以前 有一笔50万的取款
Week before the 25 grand was wired to the hit man,there was a $500,000 withdrawal.

457
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,220
我追踪这笔钱 发现被汇入了哥斯达黎加 的一个赌博网站
I tracked it to an online gambling Web site in Costa Rica.

458
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,120
转账人是Kaplan的业务经理 Drew Turner
Transaction was initiated by Kaplan's business manager,Drew Turner.

459
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,420
我们告诉过你Drew是个女的 是吧?
We told you that Drew is a woman,right?

460
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,750
那是当然
Of course we did.

461
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,570
她有权限进入这个帐户 这你也知道
She is authorized to sign on the account.You knew that,too.

462
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,720
她告诉我们她有几个月 没有跟Kaplan联系了
She told us she hadn't talked to Kaplan in months.

463
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,100
我们认为小坏猫正在做什么坏事
We think that little kitty cat is up to something.

464
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,960
很显然 她跟George Kaplan是一伙的
Clearly,she and George Kaplan were in this together.

465
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,800
Turner没有来跟Abby画素描
Turner did not show to do the sketch with Abby.

466
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,440
把她带来
Bring her in.

467
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,850
她不在家
She's not home.

468
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,010
车子在这儿
Car's here.

469
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,500
我让Abby追踪她的手机
I'm going to have Abby track her cell.

470
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,660
你想看见啥 Tony?
What do you expect to see,Tony?

471
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,240
你不用追踪手机了 她在家
You don't have to track her cell.She's home.

472
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,020
她在做什么?
What's she doing?

473
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,690
没做什么
Not much.

474
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,960
我们最好通知Gibbs
We better call Gibbs.

475
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,310
她是平民
She's a civilian.

476
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,270
我要要回尸体
I want the body.

477
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,930
不行 是我们找到的
No.We found her.

478
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,800
她是找到杀手的主要线索
She's our lead to who may have put out the hit out on the commander.

479
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,990
她现在死了 对你们也没啥帮助了
A lot of good she's going to do you dead.

480
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,810
留下什么自杀遗言没有?
She leave a suicide note?

481
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,530
刚刚去世的Turner小姐不是自杀的
The late Ms.Turner did not commit suicide.

482
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,750
你说啥呢?
What are you talking about?

483
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,060
她自己上吊的
She hung herself.

484
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,830
Mallard医生 这是警探Sportelli
Dr. Mallard,meet Metro Detective Sportelli.

485
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,580
- 早 我应该跟您握手 但是... - 啊 没关系
- Good morning I'd shake hands,but,uh... - Ah,I'm cool.

486
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,570
你怎么想 Duck?
What are you thinking,Duck?

487
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,110
上吊是掩饰
Well,the hanging was staged.

488
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,090
你怎么知道?
How can you tell?

489
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:25,040
这么说吧 上吊自杀是很少为女性所采用的 非常不典型
Well,to begin with,suicide by hanging is very unusual,uncharacteristic for a female.

490
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,870
所以我对此很怀疑
So I was suspicious.

491
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,480
人体组织在死后的表现是不一样的
Human flesh reacts differently after death.

492
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,890
当一个人上吊自杀 因为体重的关系 他的脖子会被往上吊起
When a person hangs themself,they are suspended by the neck with the weight of the body pulling downwards.

493
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,890
吊绳会在皮肤上形成前后深浅不一的痕迹
The ligature creates a furrow with a pattern that runs from the front to the back.

494
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:45,050
但是如果是死后形成的 就像这个案子一样 痕迹深浅是一样的
But when the ligature is applied after death,as in this case,you can see it's fairly even.

495
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,660
皮肤组织 当没有血液进入时 产生的反应是完全不同的
The tissue,not being infused with blood,reacts differently.

496
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,550
看上去更干涸且发黄
It's drier and more yellowish.

497
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,850
那她怎么死的
Then how did she die?

498
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:58,950
我切开了她的颈部 发现器官上的瘀伤 和用手勒毙一致
Well,I opened up the neck,and I found bruising on her organs consistent with manual strangulation.

499
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:07,210
Turner女士是被掐死的 然后才被吊起来使她的死亡方式看起来像自杀
Ms.Turner was choked to death,and then hanged to make it look as if the manner of death was indeed suicide.

500
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,800
掩饰?伪造自杀?
A cover-up?Fake suicide?

501
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,510
她是不是被George Kaplan杀了?
Think she was killed by George Kaplan?

502
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,460
如果Kaplan根本就不存在呢?
What if there isn't a Kaplan?

503
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,500
除了Drew Turner以外 只有Kaplan的女房东声称见到过他
The only person other than Drew Turner who says

504
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:23,100
而她的记忆实在太模糊了
that they met Kaplan is his landlady,and she's got a real fuzzy memory.

505
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,770
我们也没有找到他带照片的身份证明
We've got no photo I.D. of him.

506
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,450
也许Drew Turner就是Kaplan
Maybe Drew Turner was Kaplan.

507
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,410
我不觉得 在我看来她可不像那个George
I don't know.She doesn't look like a George to me.

508
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,140
另外 他们两人也都在 经纪账户的授权卡上签了字
Besides,the two of them did sign the authorization card for the brokerage account.

509
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,610
她可以伪造笔迹签上两个人的名字
She could have disguised her handwriting and signed both.

510
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:43,650
假的自杀 假的名字 女人伪装成男人
Faked suicide,fake names,women pretending to be men.

511
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,750
越来越混乱了
This is getting messy.

512
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,530
告诉你们... 我不干了
I tell you what... I'm out of here.

513
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,370
我让你们直接跟FBI一决高下吧
I'll let you duke it out with the FBI.

514
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,640
拜拜 Gibbs
So long,Gibbs.

515
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,930
这一切到底是怎么跟 Brett少校联系上的?
How does this all tie into Commander Brett?

516
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:01,010
我们还是不知道为什么有人要让他死
We still don't know why someone wants him dead.

517
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,900
这就像总统班底里的深喉所说的: "跟着钱走"
<i>It's like Deep Throat said in All the President's Men: "Follow the money.</i>

518
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,650
在Kaplan的银行账户中 还有超过一百万美元
" There's over a million bucks in Kaplan's account still.

519
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,140
我们知道其中一部分他花在了哪儿
We know what he spent some of it on.

520
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,980
支付赌债 安排谋杀
Paying off gambling debts,ordering a hit.

521
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,030
那这些钱是从哪儿来的呢?
Where'd the money come from?

522
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,840
老大 我去试试让Abby比对两个签名 看看是不是同一个人所写
Boss,I'm going to try and get Abby to compare both signatures,see if th were made by the same person.

523
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,400
试试 McGee?

524
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,360

Well,Abby's been real distracted by this brother thing.

525
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,840
是的 我发现了 她没有运气找到那个家伙的
Yeah,I noticed.She had no luck finding the guy.

526
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,050
你想想办法
Do your thing.

527
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,310
看看你能找到什么 跟她的兄弟有关的消息
See what you can find out about the brother.

528
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,550
Drew Turner?
Drew Turner?

529
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,930
没有 从来没听过这个名字
Nope,never heard the name.

530
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,090
- 他是谁? - 她
- Who is he? - She.

531
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,900
Kaplan的业务经理
Kaplan's business manager.

532
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,150
她昨天被发现已经死亡
She was found dead yesterday.

533
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,920
她怎么死的?
How did she die?

534
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,050
谋杀
Murdered.

535
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,710
这跟对你的谋杀有联系
There's a connection to the hit on you.

536
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,460
这就是为什么需要对你 进行保护性监视 少校
That is why you need to stay in protective custody,Commander.

537
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:03,350
好的 你说服我了
All right. You convinced me.

538
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,900
我对你放弃抵抗了
I won't fight you anymore.

539
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,500
请看字母和名字之间的间距
Look at the spacing between the letters and the names.

540
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:18,420
我对比了两个名字里共有字母-- "E," "N" 还有 "R"
I compared the relative height,width,size and slant of the letters that are common to both names--

541
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,890
相应的高度 宽度 尺寸和倾斜度
"E," "N" and "R.

542
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:25,750
基本书写习惯完全不同 因此签名肯定是由两个不同的人完成
" The baseline habits are totally different,so these signatures were definitely made by two separate people.

543
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,010
你确定?

看看Kaplan的签名
Now,look at Kaplan's signature.

546
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:36,410
字母"a"的转折处和字母"e"短促的弯曲部分-- 都有非常男性化的特点
The counter of the "A"s and the cramped loop of the "E"-- it's a very masculine trait.

547
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:40,090
所以男性和女性笔迹是有区别的?
So there's a difference between male and female handwriting?

548
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,120
当然
Of course.

549
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,780
好吧 我错了

I'm going to dust the original signature card.

552
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:52,150
也许Kaplan在签名的时候留下了指纹
Maybe Kaplan left a print when he signed it.

553
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,190

NCIS说有对我的人身威胁

570

别担心 肯定是弄错了

并非来自他的军队补助

他需要把钱洗干净 所以他需要来自 他的甜心加会计Drew Turner的帮忙
He had to launder it,so he got a little help from his bar honey/accountant,Drew Turner.

653
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,890
他们创造了虚拟的George Kaplan

655
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,210
这法子真行
It was brilliant.

656
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,750
是啊 直到出了岔子
Yeah. Until it went sideways.

657
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,220
很可爱 对不对?
Cute,huh?

658
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,790
他脾气可好了
He has a great personality.

659
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,270
你想不想抱他?
You want to hold him?

660
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,500
我是不是认识你?
Do I know you from somewhere?

661
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,730
我不觉得
Um,I don't think so.

662
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,880
11街的狗狗公园 对吗?
The dog park on 11th,right?

663
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,030
我从没去过那儿
I've never been there.

664
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,820
你看上去真挺眼熟的
You sure look familiar.

665
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,490
你有想过今天带一只狗狗回家吗?
Are you looking to rescue a pet today?

666
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,210
呃...没这个打算
Um... no.

667
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,800
我是--随便逛逛

不过 我-我很欣赏你在这里做的一切

我喜欢你的狗颈圈
I love your dog collar.

670
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,850
我们这儿有只斗牛犬也有个一样的
We have a pit bull terrier that has one just like it.

671
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,300
来-进来看看 我... 你会喜欢上它的
Come-come take a look.I'm... You'll get a kick out of her.

672
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,110
来吧
Come on.

673
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,330
过几天就要投票了
The vote's in a couple days.

674
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,320
跟被拽回NCIS相比 我有更好的事做
I have better things to do than be dragged back to NCIS.

675
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,030
我们在案子上有突破
We had a break in the case.

676
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,850
你为啥不告诉我啥情况?
Why don't you just tell me what it is?

677
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,680
"审问室"?
"Interrogation Room"?

678
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,600
哦 听上去可不妙啊
Well,that doesn't sound good.

679
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,700
不好意思 不知道这间有人了
Sorry.Did not know this room was used.

680
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,970
不是问题
Not a problem.

681
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,770
马上要收尾了
Just finishing up here.

682
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,730
你认识Nick Sandlock

We were just talking about Stembridge,kickbacks and Swiss banks.

685
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,590
拜拜
Bye-bye.

686
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,650
我是特别探员McGee

687
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,980
你看上需要坐下歇会儿 司令官
You look like you may need to sit down,Commander.

688
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:12,420
是啊 直到Drew Turner惹了麻烦之前 都进展的不错
Yeah,sounded like a pretty sweet plan till Drew Turner got in trouble.

689
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,950
那是什么 哥斯达黎加?
What was it,Costa Rica?

690
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,060
她赌博?
Her gambling?

691
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,870
她赌博成瘾
She was addicted to it.

692
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,380
你何时意识到她在用你的钱还赌债?
When did you realize she was using your money to pay off her bets?

693
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:28,300
当你说"George Kaplan"要暗杀我的时候
When you said "George Kaplan" took out a hit on me.

694
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,760
只有Drew知道这个名字
Drew was the only other person who knew that name.

695
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,720
你要是死了 她就能动账户里的所有钱
With you dead,she'd have access to everything in the account.

696
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:39,820
那个贪财的婊子为了钱杀我
The greedy bitch used the money to have me killed.

697
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,510
这就是你为啥甩了Ziva? 嗯?
That why you ditched Ziva?Hmm?

698
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,540
所以你可以去干掉她?
So you could go after her?

699
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,490
我是为了我女儿存的钱
I was putting that money away for my daughter.

700
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,430
为了她将来

门没锁 Abbs
Door's unlocked,Abbs.

704
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,900
嗨 Gibbs.
Hi,Gibbs.

705
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,220
怎么样? 你见过那人了?
So? You see the guy?

706
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:50,110
Kyle? 我兄弟?没错
Kyle?My brother? - Yeah.

707
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,670
怎么样?
How'd it go?

708
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:58,450
挺好的 我没跟他说我是谁
It was fine. I didn't tell him who I was.

709
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:01,370
他看上去真的是个好人
He seems really,really nice.

710
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,620
他不需要其他的压力了
He doesn't need the added stress.

711
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,130
我是说 他刚被选上去捐肾 手术明天进行
I mean,he just got chosen to donate a kidney,and the operation's tomorrow.

712
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,850
我只是...需要理清一些头绪 你知道?
I just... I have things I have to work out,you know?

713
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,040
你在喝茶吗?
Are you drinking tea?

714
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:16,950
对啊 别告诉Ducky 他非得给我上一课
Yeah.Don't tell Ducky.He'll give me a lecture on brewing.

715
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,910
你需要想清楚什么 Abbs?
What do you need to work out,Abbs?

716
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:25,680
就是...这个兄妹事呗
Just... this whole brother-sister thing.

717
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,160
我对此毫无头绪
It didn't make any sense to me.

718
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,680
我是说 Kyle和我--我们的DNA完全吻合
I mean,Kyle and me-- our DNA is a total match.

719
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,630
也就是说我们拥有共同的生父母
So,we have to have the same biological parents.

720
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:40,500
所以我怎么说"嘿 为什么他们不要你?
So then I was like,"What,did they give him up for adoption?

721
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:49,050
而我很难想象一对养育大我和Luca的完美父母竟然会放弃另一个孩子
And I-I can't imagine the wonderful,loving parents that raised me and Luca ever giving up a child.

722
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,620
可他们可以收养一个孩子
But they would have adopted a child.

723
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,340
他们这么做了
And they did.

724
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,880
就是我
Me.

725
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,680
我是被收养的 Gibbs
I'm adopted,Gibbs.

726
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,350
你是怎么发现的?
How do you know that?

727
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,250
这是我妈妈的头发
This is my mom's hair.

728
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:19,510
我对它做了DNA测试 和我的进行了对比
And I ran a DNA test on it and I compared it to mine.

729
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,180
它们在生物学上不吻合 Gibbs
It wasn't a biological match,Gibbs.

730
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,360
所以 我...我都知道自己是谁了
So I... I don't know who I am anymore.

731
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,750
我甚至连自己的父母都不知道
I don't know who my parents were.

732
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:37,200
我就像个...像个小孤儿Abby
I'm just like... like Little Orphan Abby.

733
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,840
Abbs...你还是你
Abbs... you're still the same person.

734
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:47,380
你的父母--还是你的父母 只要你记得他们
Your parents-- they're still your parents,as you remember them.

735
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:54,870
亲人可远不是...DNA
Family's more than just... DNA.

736
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:03,800
是...关心爱护你的人们
It's about.. people who care and take care of each other.

737
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,590
我知道
I know.

738
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:11,810
可他们为什么不告诉我是领养的?
But why didn't they tell me I was adopted?

739
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,970
我是说 总有个原因
I mean,there's got to be a reason.

740
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:21,930
我是说我得查出来 在我把Luca和Kyle 的生活弄得天翻地覆之前
And I need to find out before I completely turn Luca and Kyle's lives upside down.

741
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,260
你没必要自己一个人去做 Abby
You don't have to do this alone,Abby.

742
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,530
你有家人
You've got a family.

743
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,300
我们也会帮你度过难关
And we'll help you through it.
