2
00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:06,162
Okay, we're set.

3
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:11,742
Later this week, Congress will be voting
on a $14 billion appropriation

4
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:14,758
for construction
of a new class aircraft carrier.

5
00:00:14,842 --> 00:00:18,032
Many watchdog groups feel that the money
would be better spent at home,

6
00:00:18,116 --> 00:00:21,020
on schools and infrastructure.
Your opinion?

7
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:24,456
That's a difficult question
for me to answer.

8
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,450
I don't really know
what the military needs.

9
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:29,958
That's a husband question.

10
00:00:30,042 --> 00:00:33,001
I'd have to talk to him to see
how I feel about it.

11
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:34,791
Thank you.

12
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,866
Your honesty is refreshing.

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,147
Okay, we're good.

14
00:00:38,397 --> 00:00:40,205
Chad,
the guy with the camera over there.

15
00:00:40,362 --> 00:00:41,932
Excuse me, sir, ZNN.

16
00:00:42,016 --> 00:00:43,813
Can we interview you
for the evening news?

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,217
- It'll only take a second.
- Please, don't point that at me.

18
00:00:47,301 --> 00:00:48,751
Please, sir, if you could just...

19
00:00:56,545 --> 00:00:58,047
Someone call 911!

20

www.Team-NCIS.com

24
00:01:35,286 --> 00:01:36,843
Abby, what, what?

25
00:01:36,927 --> 00:01:38,389
Unbelievable.
I was chosen.

26
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,643
I'm a match.

27
00:01:39,727 --> 00:01:42,310
They want me down at the hospital
for an interview right away.

28
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:43,811
You donating bone marrow again?

29
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,185
No. A kidney.

30
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:48,258
- Who do you know that needs a kidney?
- I don't know him. I just volunteered.

31
00:01:48,712 --> 00:01:50,665
Slow down. Back up.
What are you talking about?

32
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:52,064
I heard about it at church.

33
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:55,156
There's this 18-year-old kid,
he's on dialysis, and he needs a kidney,

34
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,700
but nobody in his family was
a match, so I had to do something.

35
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,869
I went there, got tested,
and they called me.

36
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,340
You're going to give a perfectly
good kidney to a total stranger?

37
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:04,499
- Are you out of your mind?
- That is very noble.

38
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,125
Abby, that's major surgery.

39
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,419
What's the recovery time on that?
It's gotta be weeks.

40
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,597
I don't know, but I'll find out.

41
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:13,299
I have an interview with the transplant
coordinator in, like, an hour.

42
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:17,502
Hey, Detective Sportelli,
what are you doing here?

43
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,055
- Long time.
- I gotta go.

44
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,099
Abby, don't you commit to anything.

45
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:22,767
It's gonna be great.

46
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,325
- Sportelli, what's up?
- I arrested The Cooler.

47
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:32,693
Come on, FBI's most-wanted list.

48
00:02:32,968 --> 00:02:34,236
It's a career-making bust.

49
00:02:34,392 --> 00:02:36,367
- The Cooler?
- He puts people on ice.

50
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:40,451
He's suspected in at least a half-dozen
high-profile contract assassinations.

51
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:44,041
The only thing tying the cases together
is the slugs taken from the victims.

52
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,687
Yeah, he's been like a ghost,
blending into the background.

53
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,347
FBI has no idea what he looks like,
let alone have a name.

54
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:51,546
They got one now.
Paul Arliss.

55
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:53,465
He's been living
the good life in suburbia.

56
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,675
On a <i>cul-de-sac</i> in Woodley Park.

57
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,678
- How'd you catch him?
- News doing on-the-street interviews.

58
00:02:58,852 --> 00:03:01,328
He tried to avoid the camera
and ran into traffic.

59
00:03:01,412 --> 00:03:02,555
Got hit by a van.

60
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,058
He's in critical condition.

61
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,631
I saw footage of that
on the news last night.

62
00:03:06,715 --> 00:03:08,896
They did not mention anything
about him being a fugitive.

63
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,437
We kept it quiet
till we figured out who he was.

64
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:13,526
You gotta keep that quiet.

65
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,428
You wouldn't want anyone to know.

66
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:19,453
Great work, Detective Sportelli.
You arrested the unconscious man.

67
00:03:19,537 --> 00:03:21,909
Did you have to cuff him
when he was down on the sidewalk there?

68
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,659
How'd you I.D. him?

69
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:30,418
Ballistics tied the weapon
he was carrying to four unsolved hits.

70
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:33,921
- You here to gloat?
- No, I'm here to help you.

71
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:37,675
We found surveillance photos
and handwritten notes in his car,

72
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,218
parked about a block away.

73
00:03:39,728 --> 00:03:41,012
Looks like his next target

74
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:44,239
is going to be a Navy Lieutenant
Commander named Geoffrey Brett.

75
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,575
You got any leads
on who hired Arliss?

76
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,855
We need to interview him.
Where is he?

77
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,187
Washington General Hospital
prison ward.

78
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:55,609
I'll call you
when he's able to speak.

79
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:59,280
Great detective work, Sportelli.
I think we're all very proud of you.

80
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:01,199
Always a pleasure, DiNozzo.

81
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,370
Boss, Commander Brett's
an Academy grad.

82
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,537
Top Gun pilot.

83
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:10,041
Flew F-18 Hornets
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

84
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,737
Got shot down over Kunar Province.

85
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:14,923
Wait a second.
I know him.

86
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:17,572
That's the guy that survived
by eating mud, bark

87
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:19,383
and bugs while evading the Taliban.

88
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,261
Took the Marines
two weeks to find and rescue him.

89
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:25,108
One tough S.O.B.

90
00:04:25,192 --> 00:04:26,945
He's divorced, has one daughter.

91
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:28,812
Currently assigned
as a legislative fellow

92
00:04:28,896 --> 00:04:31,552
to the House Armed
Services Committee.

93
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,197
<i>Good afternoon.
Lieutenant Commander Brett's office.</i>

94
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:42,121
You say
this guy was trying to kill me.

95
00:04:42,737 --> 00:04:44,321
Got a good reason to believe so.

96
00:04:44,405 --> 00:04:46,169
He's a wanted contract killer.

97
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:48,871
This is crazy.

98
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,497
I can't think of anyone
who would want me dead.

99
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,345
It's got to be a joke.

100
00:04:55,408 --> 00:04:57,296
Captain Thornton put you up to this,
didn't he?

101
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,787
I don't know Captain Thornton.

102
00:04:59,073 --> 00:05:01,425
Clearly this must be
some sort of mistake.

103
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,913
Metro police came to us
with solid evidence.

104
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,846
You said the guy's been caught,
so there's nothing to worry about.

105
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,412
Whoever hired him to kill you,
wants you dead.

106
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:12,527
They'll find someone else
to do the job.

107
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:15,231
We would like to put you in protective
custody until we know more.

108
00:05:15,888 --> 00:05:16,940
You're serious?

109
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:20,027
I can take care of myself.

110
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,491
My job is to advise the members
of the Armed Services Committee.

111
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,951
There's a critical vote about

112
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:30,353
to take place on the Hill regarding
a substantial military expenditure.

113
00:05:30,437 --> 00:05:32,363
I'm going to be
in sensitive meetings all week.

114
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,166
Let an agent shadow you at work.

115
00:05:34,442 --> 00:05:37,424
We'll set you up tonight at
the officers' quarters at the Navy Yard.

116
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,096
Yeah, I don't know, I've...

117
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,051
And who will be
the agent shadowing me?

118
00:05:54,446 --> 00:05:55,565
Hi, Ducky.

119
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:56,814
Just a second, Abby.

120
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,402
I'm just finishing cleaning
and lubricating

121
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:01,652
the Hornby model of my namesake...

122
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,381
"The Mallard",
magnificent locomotive.

123
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,626
It set the world speed record
for a steam engine back in 1938.

124
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:11,287
126 miles per hour.

125
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,171
It was on a slight downgrade between

126
00:06:14,255 --> 00:06:16,375
Bytham and Essendine.

127
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,134
Remained in service until 1960...

128
00:06:23,694 --> 00:06:24,804
What's the matter?

129
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:26,603
Do you have a minute?

130
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:27,635
Certainly.

131
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:29,847
- I just came from the hospital.
- I heard.

132
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,328
Donating a kidney

133
00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:36,026
is not a decision
to be taken lightly.

134
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,663
The transplant coordinator said that
I'm not the only one that's a match.

135
00:06:40,781 --> 00:06:42,568
- There's also a guy.
- Really?

136
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,627
Well, usually it's hard
to find one donor that's a match.

137
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:46,614
Yeah, exactly.

138
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,995
That's why she was amazed

139
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,785
that she found a brother
and a sister both willing to donate.

140
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,615
Your brother also volunteered?

141
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,663
No. I spoke to Luca.

142
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,667
- He doesn't know anything about it.
- I'm confused.

143
00:06:59,074 --> 00:07:03,012
Why does the transplant coordinator
think that you and this man are...

144
00:07:03,596 --> 00:07:04,673
siblings?

145
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:08,781
As part of the screening process, we had
to give a mitochondrial DNA sample.

146
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,222
Ours was a dead-on match, Ducky.

147
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:14,433
More than 99.9%.

148
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:18,770
We have to be full-on
brother and sister, right?

149
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:23,077
I pressed the coordinator for details...
like his name and address, but

150
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:25,777
she clammed up,
saying she'd said too much already.

151
00:07:25,897 --> 00:07:27,865
It's pro forma
for all donors' medical

152
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:30,621
and personal records
to be kept confidential.

153
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:34,581
Could my parents
have had another child

154
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:36,497
they gave up for adoption?

155
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,706
I mean, it doesn't make any sense.

156
00:07:38,984 --> 00:07:40,040
I don't believe it.

157
00:07:40,124 --> 00:07:43,523
And neither does my little brother Luca.
He's as blown away as I am.

158
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:47,819
With your parents deceased,
isn't there anyone else you can ask?

159
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:52,094
Thanks for listening.

160
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:59,262
I think
we should have waited for Gibbs.

161
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,631
No time.
Sportelli said he was conscious.

162
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,161
We don't know for how long.

163
00:08:03,245 --> 00:08:05,499
When we get into the room,
you let me do the talking.

164
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,448
Why?

165
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,995
The Cooler's evaded
the FBI for years.

166
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,700
Getting him to tell us who took out
the hit on Commander Brett is going

167
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:13,939
- to take a deft hand.
- And that's you?

168
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,711
You didn't even know
who The Cooler was until I told you.

169
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:18,440
Neither did Ziva.

170
00:08:18,524 --> 00:08:21,662
I need to talk to him alone, so you've
got to get Sportelli out of the room.

171
00:08:21,746 --> 00:08:23,251
And how am I supposed to do that?

172
00:08:23,368 --> 00:08:25,220
I don't know...
you distract him.

173
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:29,026
Talk about your stupid obsession with
jet packs... men strapped to rockets.

174
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,308
- I am not obsessed.
- Special agents.

175
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:34,472
You're not going to get
to talk to Arliss, boys.

176
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,599
- You said we could.
- He flatlined.

177
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:37,909
He's dead?

178
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:40,242
Over and out.

179
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,992
Hard to believe this guy
was an infamous killer.

180
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:52,156
Up until yesterday,
his only claim to fame was

181
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,993
salesman of the year as a manufacturer's
rep for a furniture company.

182
00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:58,496
He's got a wife, two kids,
no criminal record.

183
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,850
Not even a parking ticket.

184
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:02,666
He evaded the FBI for years
by hiding in plain sight.

185
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,641
In a weird way,
you got to admire the guy...

186
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:06,711
He's a mass murderer.

187
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:08,097
Despicable.

188
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,840
Nothing to admire.

189
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,956
You connect him to anyone
who knows the commander?

190
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,967
No. Metro's got a team going
through his house.

191
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:16,013
If only I could have interrogated him,
I tell ya.

192
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,973
Five minutes in my magic hands

193
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,935
and I would have had him coughing up
the name of that hit man.

194
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:21,903
5 minutes?

195
00:09:21,987 --> 00:09:24,280
5 minutes,
because I learned from the best.

196
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:27,483
- We need to find out who hired him.
- I've been looking for enemies.

197
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:30,556
But Commander Brett
is a decorated hero.

198
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,922
He's well-liked.
Spoke to his former C.O.

199
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:36,116
He climbed over people while angling
for his plum assignment on the Hill,

200
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,978
but no one denies he deserved it.

201
00:09:38,062 --> 00:09:41,247
While angling for his plum assignment
on the Hill? Who talks like that?

202
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:46,027
I'm already five minutes late.

203
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:47,711
Is your day always this busy?

204
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,045
Some are worse.

205
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:50,769
Especially when there's a big vote.

206
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,594
It's the first time I've ever been
accompanied by a woman who's packing.

207
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,059
Packing?

208
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,029
Carrying a gun.

209
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:02,518
Why does someone who looks like you
become an NCIS agent?

210
00:10:02,948 --> 00:10:04,747
What are agents
supposed to look like?

211
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:06,953
Stern, surly, humorless.

212
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,075
The problem with you guys
is you're too uptight.

213
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,571
Try lightening up a little.

214
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:17,116
Agent Ziva, relax.
I know him.

215
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,715
- Sorry, Nick. You okay?
- Yeah. No!

216
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,206
What the hell is going on?

217
00:10:28,048 --> 00:10:31,240
They mistakenly believe
I need protection. It's nothing really.

218
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,506
You just roughed up
one of the barons of K Street.

219
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,718
He avoids using the pejorative.
I'm a lobbyist.

220
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,929
Are you going to be in your office later
this afternoon? I need to talk to you.

221
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,182
- Yeah, I'll be back around 4:00.
- Great. Nice meeting you, I think.

222
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:51,152
Thanks for being so discreet.

223
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,629
What the hell's DiNozzo doing?

224
00:11:03,202 --> 00:11:04,121
I don't know.

225
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:09,463
Are you sure about Arliss' wife?

226
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:11,587
She thought he was on the road,
selling furniture.

227
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,006
Be my guest. Talk to her.
Look around.

228
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:15,656
Better move fast.

229
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,426
FBI's on their way.

230
00:11:17,781 --> 00:11:18,914
They're taking over.

231
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,680
Hate those guys.
Glory hounds.

232
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,932
I'd rather deal with you
than the Bureau.

233
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,267
I don't blame you.

234
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:32,232
Something's wrong here.

235
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,935
I paced off the inside
and outside of the garage.

236
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,403
There's a couple feet missing.

237
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,650
Looks like there's some electrical power
going behind this wall.

238
00:11:44,606 --> 00:11:46,017
Sounds hollow.

239
00:11:46,101 --> 00:11:47,574
There's something back here.

240
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,200
There's a seam.

241
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:00,844
That's interesting.

242
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:15,582
Eureka.

243
00:12:16,491 --> 00:12:19,351
- The FBI'S gonna have a field day.
- Oh, yeah, they will.

244
00:12:22,043 --> 00:12:23,778
Do you want to let us take
the computer?

245
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,576
Our people are real good.

246
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,787
Our people are real good.

247
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,373
You'll tell me what you find.

248
00:12:35,227 --> 00:12:38,016
No, this doesn't have anything
to do with a sweepstakes.

249
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:44,138
No, no, I'm Abigail,

250
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,149
your niece...

251
00:12:45,408 --> 00:12:46,598
Gloria's daughter?

252
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,048
- What're you doing?
- I found something on Arliss' computer.

253
00:12:49,132 --> 00:12:52,187
I need to clone his hard drive.
Do you have your USB-3 cable?

254
00:12:55,283 --> 00:12:58,137
No, no,
I'm not a cheerleader anymore.

255
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:01,238
I graduated high school
a long time ago.

256
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,621
I'm sorry.
I can't bring you bonbons now.

257
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,668
I live in Washington DC, now.

258
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:10,748
I'll visit soon, yeah, I promise.

259
00:13:11,588 --> 00:13:13,696
No, this is, this is Abby.

260
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:19,263
Okay, Aunt Gert,

261
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,305
go have your dinner.

262
00:13:24,663 --> 00:13:26,025
Love you. Bye.

263
00:13:33,057 --> 00:13:34,623
Abby, you okay?

264
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:36,565
I just thought if anyone

265
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,694
would know about my parents
giving up a child, it'd be my Aunt Gert,

266
00:13:40,294 --> 00:13:42,873
but she can't even remember
her own name, poor thing.

267
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:44,874
Her dementia's gotten so bad.

268
00:13:45,175 --> 00:13:48,089
- That your aunt?
- No, it's my mom.

269
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,579
She was beautiful.

270
00:13:50,994 --> 00:13:52,276
She was beautiful.

271
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,666
What'd you find?

272
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,960
Well, the day before
Arliss was hit by the truck,

273
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,797
he received a $25,000 wire transfer

274
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,157
from the brokerage account
of a "George Kaplan".

275
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,477
$25,000.

276
00:14:05,174 --> 00:14:07,596
That's how much it costs to get
somebody whacked these days?

277
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,661
Mr. Kaplan lives at 1313 Branchport
Avenue, Northwest,

278
00:14:11,745 --> 00:14:13,408
apartment 3C.

279
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,863
I wish you could spend the night,
honey

280
00:14:21,947 --> 00:14:24,613
but something has come up
and Daddy has to stay in the city, okay?

281
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,958
I'll talk to your mother.

282
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:28,200
We'll see if we can work out
something for the weekend.

283
00:14:29,017 --> 00:14:30,202
Yes, I promise.

284
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,621
Okay, I love you, sweetheart.
Bye.

285
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:35,249
How old is she?

286
00:14:35,682 --> 00:14:36,708
Eight.

287
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,608
She has special needs,
but she doesn't let it stop her.

288
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,970
She's a great kid.

289
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:49,054
She's adorable.
What's her name?

290
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,142
Matilda.

291
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,793
I call her Tilly.

292
00:14:52,771 --> 00:14:53,892
She's my life.

293
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,980
- You found something.
- You know a man named George Kaplan?

294
00:15:00,387 --> 00:15:02,651
- Should I?
- We believe he put out the hit on you.

295
00:15:03,845 --> 00:15:05,612
Well, has he been arrested?

296
00:15:07,476 --> 00:15:10,182
Not yet. We got a lead on an address.
We're still looking for him.

297
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:11,702
This is getting crazier.

298
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,086
Why would someone I don't know
want to have me killed?

299
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,124
And about my daughter?

300
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,004
My ex wanted to take Tilly
to her parent's house in Hilton Head.

301
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,506
I'm gonna tell her to do it.

302
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,770
What do you expect to see?

303
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:36,057
I don't know. You'd think a guy
who popped 25 grand for a hit

304
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:37,811
would live in better digs than this.

305
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,947
I've been meaning
on getting that fixed.

306
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,201
Boss, this is the landlady,
Mrs. Roach.

307
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:46,403
Understand you don't have
a warrant, Boss.

308
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:49,197
I can get one if you want.

309
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,662
Let's get this over with.
I'm missing Judge Judy.

310
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:07,439
Kaplan's got terrible taste.

311
00:16:07,783 --> 00:16:09,343
The apartment comes furnished.

312
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,031
- I picked everything out.
- How long's Kaplan been living here?

313
00:16:12,115 --> 00:16:15,307
- Over a year. Maybe a year and a half.
- No clothes in the closet.

314
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,476
- No food.
- When's the last time you saw Kaplan?

315
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:20,854
- When I rented him the apartment.
- You haven't seen him since?

316
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,938
Don't think so.

317
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,941
You don't find it strange someone rents
an apartment then doesn't use it?

318
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,402
He's my best tenant.
Doesn't make any noise.

319
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,770
His business manager sends a check,
every month, on time.

320
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:33,325
Guy who lives in this dump like this
has a business manager?

321
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,994
No offense.

322
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,580
- What's the business manager's name?
- I don't know.

323
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,540
I mean,
I got the name in my apartment.

324
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,920
I suppose you want me to go down
and get it.

325
00:16:50,336 --> 00:16:51,969
You wanna come with me, Boss?

326
00:16:58,081 --> 00:16:59,142
I'll wait here.

327
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,231
It's what they call a turkey vulture.
20 years past a cougar.

328
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,025
Still likes to hunt,
but too old to take down the prey.

329
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,699
I wouldn't bet on that.

330
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:13,156
Dust for prints, Boss?

331
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,121
It's late.

332
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:20,383
- I'm not that hungry.
- Let's just get to the Navy Yard.

333
00:17:22,046 --> 00:17:25,293
- I don't want to spend the night there.
- Hopefully, it won't be for long.

334
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,262
Let's take the stairs.
It's quicker.

335
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,146
After you.

336
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:38,390
<i>Sorry.</i>

337
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,403
<i>Open it.</i>

338
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:42,818
<i>Goodbye.</i>

339
00:17:57,941 --> 00:17:59,271
Any response to the BOLO?

340
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,021
I felt, all day,
he wanted to shake me.

341
00:18:03,105 --> 00:18:05,041
Hard to protect someone
who doesn't want to be.

342
00:18:05,489 --> 00:18:08,003
- His cell's still off.
- What was his schedule this morning?

343
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,730
Has to be in his office
by 11:00 a.m.

344
00:18:09,814 --> 00:18:12,137
for a conference call
with Admiral Mosley in Pearl Harbor.

345
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:13,508
I doubt he'll miss that.

346
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,828
You got anything?

347
00:18:14,912 --> 00:18:18,096
There's no DC driver's license
or passport issued

348
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,391
to a George Kaplan
at 1313 Branchport Avenue, Northwest.

349
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,814
We're trying surrounding states,
but it's common name.

350
00:18:23,898 --> 00:18:26,354
- There's gonna be a lot of hits.
- Military or criminal record?

351
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,940
I got something.

352
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:34,001
The Social Security number of the George
Kaplan on Branchport Avenue.

353
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,430
- Why does it sound so familiar?
- Where'd you get the number?

354
00:18:37,514 --> 00:18:39,034
Kaplan's stockbroker.

355
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,913
Turns out he's got $1.1 mil in
the account that paid for the hit man.

356
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,248
- Broker give you a description?
- He ever met him.

357
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,001
Dealt with the business manager,
a Drew Turner.

358
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:50,879
It's the same name
we got from the landlady.

359
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,548
The broker says it's not unusual.
Deals with managers all the time.

360
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,004
Turns out that Turner
had power of attorney.

361
00:18:56,088 --> 00:18:59,387
All the documentation you need
to open an account.

362
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,982
Which means he's got Kaplan's
Social Security number and

363
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:05,249
address which has to be a residence.
Can't be a P.O. box.

364
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,036
Kaplan files State
and federal tax returns.

365
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,147
Prepared by...

366
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,483
Drew Turner.
Time to talk to him.

367
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,907
Subpoena the records
of Kaplan's account. Now.

368
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,469
You're a woman.

369
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,959
What gave it away?

370
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,388
Agents McGee and DiNozzo.
We need to speak with you.

371
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,589
Navy investigators.

372
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,843
I am running really late
to a meeting with the IRS.

373
00:19:40,925 --> 00:19:41,930
Come on in.

374
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,189
I just got back into town
this morning.

375
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,276
Listen, they are only auditing
your entertainment expenses

376
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,194
and I'm bringing copies
of all your receipts.

377
00:19:57,042 --> 00:19:59,167
So relax,
you have nothing to worry about, Harry.

378
00:20:00,743 --> 00:20:02,993
I can meet you in ten...

379
00:20:03,523 --> 00:20:04,786
15 minutes at the most.

380
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,661
Okay, bye.

381
00:20:08,702 --> 00:20:10,966
Nervous client.
First time being audited. Sorry.

382
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,127
Must be nice...

383
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,004
working out of your home.

384
00:20:14,664 --> 00:20:15,797
Never late to work.

385
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:17,966
I bet.

386
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,635
CPA. So you do personal tax returns?

387
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,660
It's impressive.

388
00:20:24,744 --> 00:20:27,392
We're looking for a client of yours,
George Kaplan.

389
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,061
- Do you know where we can find him?
- You check his apartment?

390
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,689
Maybe he's out of town.

391
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,665
He seems to move around a lot.

392
00:20:34,749 --> 00:20:36,610
I haven't seen him
since last tax season.

393
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:38,320
Can you describe him?

394
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,407
On the shorter side,
five-eight maybe.

395
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,493
Dark hair.

396
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,327
I don't know him that well.

397
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,820
I just helped him set up an investment
account and do his taxes once a year.

398
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,587
What is this about?

399
00:20:50,671 --> 00:20:52,876
Do you know a Lieutenant Commander
named Geoffrey Brett?

400
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,087
No. Sorry.

401
00:20:56,524 --> 00:20:58,131
And I gotta get going.

402
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,262
I mean, my client is at the IRS office
and he is hyperventilating.

403
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:06,056
We need you to come by the Navy Yard
and help us with a sketch of Kaplan.

404
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:08,391
- Are you gonna be there?
- Definitely.

405
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,106
You'll be working
with our forensic scientist Abby Sciuto.

406
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,274
Whatever.

407
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,981
I'll be there as soon as I'm done.
Let's say an hour, two at the most?

408
00:21:20,065 --> 00:21:21,497
Sounds good.
Thanks.

409
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,584
- How much trouble am I in?
- You're not taking

410
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,892
- the threat on your life seriously.
- You're right, I'm not. It's bogus.

411
00:21:37,976 --> 00:21:40,465
Fact: a professional hit man
is targeting you.

412
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,093
You have no basis. I can't,
for the life of me, think of anyone

413
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,011
- I've pissed off.
- Why'd you ditch me?

414
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:47,576
Okay, this is awkward.

415
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:50,021
- The truth?
- That would be nice.

416
00:21:50,105 --> 00:21:52,834
I was uncomfortable having you
with me in meetings all day,

417
00:21:52,918 --> 00:21:55,855
but there was no way I could
let you accompany me last night.

418
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,231
I was with a woman.

419
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,483
- She married?
- No

420
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,985
and no jealous ex-boyfriends.
Trust me, I thought of that.

421
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,653
You two don't get it.
I've got a life to live.

422
00:22:03,737 --> 00:22:05,615
And if anyone's trying to kill me

423
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,539
I can take care of myself.

424
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,789
I'm glad this is your detail
and not mine.

425
00:22:13,242 --> 00:22:14,251
Go on.

426
00:22:19,207 --> 00:22:21,298
- What do you got, Abs?
- Gibbs, you scared me.

427
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,051
What are you doing?

428
00:22:24,629 --> 00:22:27,846
I'm searching male birth records
from Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.

429
00:22:28,445 --> 00:22:29,555
You find anything?

430
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:33,560
How'd you make out with the prints found
in Kaplan's apartment?

431
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:35,854
I haven't gotten to them yet.

432
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,439
What about the computer sketch?

433
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,483
- His business manager never showed up.
- Did you tell Tony, McGee?

434
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,321
I've been a little distracted.

435
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,782
I need you.

436
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,827
I appreciate it.

437
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:59,210
Broker said he got a call from
Drew Turner, the hot, sexy accountant,

438
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:02,521
last week, authorizing
the money transfer to Costa Rica

439
00:23:02,605 --> 00:23:03,923
from Kaplan's account.

440
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,968
She told us she hadn't spoken to Kaplan
since last tax season.

441
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,804
- She lied.
- I guess she won't be doing your taxes.

442
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,848
- I'm going to call Gibbs.
- Hold it, probie.

443
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,517
I'm the one who subpoenaed
the brokerage papers.

444
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,729
Yeah, but I'm the one that traced
the transfer to the gambling Web site.

445
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,366
- Boss, that's me.
- Actually, that was me.

446
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,597
I got Kaplan's brokerage statement.

447
00:23:32,901 --> 00:23:35,383
Week before the 25 grand
was wired to the hit man

448
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,333
there was a $500,000 withdrawal.

449
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,377
I tracked it to an online gambling
Web site in Costa Rica.

450
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:44,703
Transaction was initiated by Kaplan's
business manager, Drew Turner.

451
00:23:44,787 --> 00:23:46,424
We told you Drew is a woman, right?

452
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,593
Of course we did.

453
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,054
She is authorized
to sign on the account.

454
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,265
You knew that, too.

455
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:54,432
She told us she hadn't talked
to Kaplan in months.

456
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,476
We think that little kitty cat
is up to something.

457
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,687
Clearly, she and George Kaplan
were in this together.

458
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,062
Turner did not show
to do the sketch with Abby.

459
00:24:02,393 --> 00:24:03,400
Bring her in.

460
00:24:17,158 --> 00:24:18,164
She's not home.

461
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:19,761
Car's here.

462
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:23,545
I'm gonna have Abby track her cell.

463
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,837
What do you expect to see, Tony?

464
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:35,473
You don't have to track her cell.
She's home.

465
00:24:36,837 --> 00:24:37,892
What's she doing?

466
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:39,893
Not much.

467
00:24:40,457 --> 00:24:41,758
We better call Gibbs.

468
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:53,847
She's a civilian.

469
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,175
- I want the body.
- No. We found her.

470
00:24:56,825 --> 00:24:59,558
She's our lead to who may have put out
the hit out on the commander.

471
00:24:59,642 --> 00:25:01,437
A lot of good
she's gonna do you dead.

472
00:25:01,881 --> 00:25:03,240
She leave a suicide note?

473
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:06,670
The late Ms. Turner
did not commit suicide.

474
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:08,715
What are you talking about?
She hung herself.

475
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,530
Meet Metro Detective Sportelli.

476
00:25:11,614 --> 00:25:13,970
Good morning.
I'd shake hands, but...

477
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,057
I'm cool.

478
00:25:15,505 --> 00:25:17,849
- What are you thinking, Duck?
- The hanging was staged.

479
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,226
- How can you tell?
- Well, to begin with,

480
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,898
suicide by hanging is very unusual

481
00:25:22,982 --> 00:25:24,965
uncharacteristic for a female.

482
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:26,441
So I was suspicious.

483
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,318
Human flesh reacts differently
after death.

484
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,321
When a person hangs themselves

485
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:34,657
they are suspended by the neck with the
weight of the body pulling downwards.

486
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,899
The ligature creates a furrow

487
00:25:36,983 --> 00:25:39,704
with a pattern that runs from the front
to the back.

488
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,998
But when the ligature
is applied after death

489
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,959
as in this case,
you can see it's fairly even.

490
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:48,594
The tissue, not being infused
with blood, reacts differently.

491
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:50,340
It's drier and more yellowish.

492
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:51,925
Then how did she die?

493
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,886
I opened up the neck,
and I found bruising

494
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,806
on her organs consistent
with manual strangulation.

495
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,352
Ms. Turner was choked to death,
and then hanged to make it look

496
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:06,356
as if the manner of death
was indeed suicide.

497
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:10,818
A cover-up?

498
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,088
Fake suicide?

499
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:16,032
- Think she was killed by George Kaplan?
- What if there isn't a Kaplan?

500
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,827
The only person other than Drew Turner
who says that they met Kaplan

501
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,470
is his landlady,
and she's got a real fuzzy memory.

502
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:24,761
We've got no photo I.D. of him.

503
00:26:25,614 --> 00:26:27,840
Maybe Drew Turner was Kaplan.

504
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,430
I don't know.

505
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:32,065
She doesn't look like a George to me.
Besides...

506
00:26:32,614 --> 00:26:36,094
they did sign the authorization card
for the brokerage account.

507
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,291
She could've disguised her handwriting,
signed both.

508
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:40,890
Faked suicide, fake names

509
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,654
women pretending to be men.

510
00:26:43,637 --> 00:26:44,852
This is getting messy.

511
00:26:46,014 --> 00:26:47,185
I tell you what...

512
00:26:47,951 --> 00:26:49,166
I'm out of here.

513
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,877
I'll let you duke it out
with the FBI.

514
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:53,901
So long, Gibbs.

515
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:57,365
How does this all tie
into Commander Brett?

516
00:26:57,826 --> 00:27:00,111
We still don't know
why someone wants him dead.

517
00:27:01,048 --> 00:27:03,465
It's like Deep Throat said
in <i>All the President's Men</i>:

518
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:04,664
"Follow the money".

519
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,417
There's over a million bucks
in Kaplan's account still.

520
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:10,628
We know what he spent some of it on.
Paying off gambling debts

521
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,868
ordering a hit.

522
00:27:13,068 --> 00:27:14,632
Where'd the money come from?

523
00:27:15,531 --> 00:27:16,968
I'm going to try and get Abby

524
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,637
to compare both signatures, see
if they were made by the same person.

525
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,014
Try, McGee?

526
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:24,336
Abby's been real distracted
by this brother thing.

527
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,358
I noticed.
She had no luck finding the guy.

528
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:28,497
Do your thing.

529
00:27:28,873 --> 00:27:30,839
See what you can find out
about the brother.

530
00:27:34,706 --> 00:27:36,224
Nope, never heard the name.

531
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:38,133
- Who is he?
- She.

532
00:27:39,984 --> 00:27:41,678
Kaplan's business manager.

533
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:43,202
She was found dead yesterday.

534
00:27:44,091 --> 00:27:45,218
How did she die?

535
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:46,831
Murdered.

536
00:27:47,984 --> 00:27:49,876
There's a connection
to the hit on you.

537
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,795
That is why you need to stay
in protective custody, Commander.

538
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:00,906
All right.

539
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:02,959
You convinced me.

540
00:28:03,841 --> 00:28:05,224
I won't fight you anymore.

541
00:28:10,713 --> 00:28:13,691
Look at the spacing between
the letters and the names.

542
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:17,022
I compared the relative height,
width, size and slant of the letters

543
00:28:17,106 --> 00:28:19,504
that are common to both names...
"E", "N" and "R".

544
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,890
The baseline habits
are totally different,

545
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:25,324
these signatures were definitely made
by two separate people.

546
00:28:26,712 --> 00:28:27,580
You sure?

547
00:28:27,934 --> 00:28:28,705
McGee.

548
00:28:29,115 --> 00:28:31,166
Now, look at Kaplan's signature.

549
00:28:31,632 --> 00:28:34,587
The counter of the "A"s
and the cramped loop of the "E"...

550
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,297
it's a very masculine trait.

551
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:40,009
There's a difference between male
and female handwriting?

552
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,051
Of course.

553
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,311
I was wrong.

554
00:28:43,697 --> 00:28:46,421
There is a George Kaplan,
and he's out there somewhere.

555
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,643
I'm going to dust
the original signature card.

556
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,270
Maybe Kaplan left a print
when he signed it.

557
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,773
My dynamic duo.

558
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,566
Does anyone know
where I can find Gibbs?

559
00:28:57,826 --> 00:29:00,071
Think he's still in the conference room.
What do you got?

560
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,596
"I know where Kaplan got the money."

561
00:29:07,515 --> 00:29:09,789
Can you just try telling us
like a normal human being?

562
00:29:11,742 --> 00:29:13,915
All the funds were wired
from the Broussard Banque

563
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:15,920
- in Geneva, Switzerland.
- Whose account?

564
00:29:16,639 --> 00:29:17,763
I don't know yet.

565
00:29:19,095 --> 00:29:21,170
But I'm going to find out.
See ya!

566
00:29:21,905 --> 00:29:24,489
We got to keep him away
from that new coffee machine.

567
00:29:28,784 --> 00:29:30,309
You got a sec?
We need to talk.

568
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,168
I think we're losing
Kenneally's vote.

569
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,148
Hello.

570
00:29:36,431 --> 00:29:37,140
Hi.

571
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,801
I'll let you two talk.

572
00:29:45,248 --> 00:29:47,626
She's still here.
You going to tell me what's going on?

573
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,340
NCIS says there's been
a threat on my life.

574
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:52,123
Don't worry.
It's got to be a mistake.

575
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,307
This will all go away
in a couple days.

576
00:29:54,391 --> 00:29:55,810
In the last year and a half,

577
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,588
there have been four deposits
into George Kaplan's account,

578
00:29:58,902 --> 00:30:01,013
totaling $1.5 million.

579
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,716
They all came from the Broussard
Banque in Switzerland.

580
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,338
Special Agent Survoy in Marseilles
is currently trying to find out

581
00:30:07,422 --> 00:30:09,807
who authorized
the transfer of funds to Kaplan.

582
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:13,101
Abby looks
like she's in a better mood.

583
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:14,353
You got something?

584
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:17,732
I pulled the prints of three people off
the brokerage account signature card.

585
00:30:17,911 --> 00:30:19,776
One was a clerk
that works in the file room.

586
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,861
And Drew Turner,
the business manager.

587
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,446
And... ta-da...

588
00:30:23,862 --> 00:30:25,874
Lieutenant Commander Geoffrey Brett.

589
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:28,088
- His fingerprints are on the card?
- There's more.

590
00:30:28,282 --> 00:30:30,203
Look at the uppercase "G"s,

591
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:34,531
and then the lowercase,
"O"s, "E"s and "R"s.

592
00:30:34,996 --> 00:30:37,481
Those signatures came
from the same person.

593
00:30:40,621 --> 00:30:43,886
Lieutenant Commander Geoffrey Brett
is George Kaplan.

594
00:30:44,607 --> 00:30:45,896
It doesn't make sense.

595
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,887
What did Brett put
a hit out on himself?

596
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:49,305
Did he kill Drew Turner?

597
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,859
We need proof that Brett
and Drew Turner knew each other.

598
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:06,864
George Kaplan!

599
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:08,418
Of course.

600
00:31:09,304 --> 00:31:11,405
I'm slipping.
What took me so long?

601
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,979
Spit it out, DiNozzo.

602
00:31:13,263 --> 00:31:15,231
The Hitchcock classic,
<i>North by Northwest</i>...

603
00:31:15,315 --> 00:31:18,507
George Kaplan is the name of the guy
who never existed.

604
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:21,061
Brett created Kaplan
to hide the money,

605
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,673
he was getting from the Broussard
Banque in Switzerland.

606
00:31:24,068 --> 00:31:27,342
Drew Turner had to be in on it.
She helped Brett set the whole thing up.

607
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:29,761
She opened up a brokerage
account under the fake name,

608
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:32,324
filed all the tax returns
and rented an apartment

609
00:31:32,408 --> 00:31:34,183
so they'd have
a valid mailing address.

610
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:35,726
DiNozzo, fill Ziva in.

611
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,404
- Can Brett hear you?
- Yes, of course.

612
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,514
- You sitting down?
- What is it?

613
00:31:48,598 --> 00:31:51,242
<i>Put on your most Mossad/ninja face.
No big reaction.</i>

614
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,910
<i>Commander Brett is George Kaplan.</i>

615
00:31:53,138 --> 00:31:54,704
They are one and the same person.

616
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:56,352
Really?

617
00:31:56,601 --> 00:31:57,665
What's the plan?

618
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,917
<i>Gibbs wants you to hang in there
until we know more.</i>

619
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:02,456
<i>Don't let him out of your sight
like you did last time.</i>

620
00:32:03,373 --> 00:32:04,097
Nice.

621
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:07,174
I'll wait for you
to call me back, sweetheart.

622
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,227
<i>Good luck.</i>

623
00:32:08,311 --> 00:32:09,051
Bye.

624
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:12,013
Boyfriend?

625
00:32:17,313 --> 00:32:19,478
DiNozzo, get me Special
Agent Survoy in Marseilles.

626
00:32:19,692 --> 00:32:21,821
I want to know
who this money's coming from.

627
00:32:22,819 --> 00:32:23,585
Boss.

628
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:27,242
- What is that?
- That call was from a friend,

629
00:32:27,326 --> 00:32:28,738
at Health and Human Services.

630
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:32,671
This is the name and address
of the man whose DNA matches Abby's.

631
00:32:32,887 --> 00:32:34,552
What should I do with it?

632
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:36,379
I'll take care of it.

633
00:32:38,852 --> 00:32:40,618
You bring me a Caf-POW as my reward?

634
00:32:42,056 --> 00:32:43,786
No. I've got something else for you.

635
00:32:46,891 --> 00:32:48,383
Is that what I think it is?

636
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:51,908
His name's Kyle Davis?

637
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:55,348
That's a lot of responsibility.
What are you gonna do with it?

638
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:57,953
I want to meet him.

639
00:32:58,893 --> 00:32:59,713
Okay.

640
00:33:00,828 --> 00:33:02,807
You sure you want to open that door?

641
00:33:09,648 --> 00:33:11,453
You want me to go with you?

642
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,706
I think this is something
I have to do alone.

643
00:33:24,057 --> 00:33:26,230
You've always known
what's best for Abby.

644
00:33:27,888 --> 00:33:29,001
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

645
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:46,076
<i>I've been in contact with Broussard
Banque in Geneva.</i>

646
00:33:46,336 --> 00:33:49,789
<i>Under the 2009 information-sharing
agreement with the United States,</i>

647
00:33:49,873 --> 00:33:52,989
<i>they gave me the name of the company
who wired the funds to "George Kaplan".</i>

648
00:33:53,572 --> 00:33:55,993
<i>It's a foreign subsidiary
to Stembridge Marine.</i>

649
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:58,328
<i>It's one of the largest naval
shipbuilders in the U.S.</i>

650
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:01,072
And Brett's the liaison for the House
Armed Services Committee.

651
00:34:01,156 --> 00:34:03,958
For the past year, he's been running up
and down the halls of Congress,

652
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,618
pushing Stembridge Marine's
$14 billion aircraft carrier.

653
00:34:06,702 --> 00:34:08,596
It's like having their own lobbyist.

654
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,632
- Can you say "kickback"?
- Thank you, Special Agent Survoy.

655
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,323
<i>I heard there's an opening
in Contingency Response.</i>

656
00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:15,803
<i>Could you put in a good...</i>

657
00:34:17,295 --> 00:34:19,765
Boss, I ran a matrix
comparing Brett's

658
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,820
and Drew Turner's credit card
statements.

659
00:34:21,904 --> 00:34:25,006
Almost every Thursday night
over the last two years,

660
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,926
they've both hung at the 1812 Pub.

661
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,547
Bartender thought they were an item.

662
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:30,526
Brett couldn't explain
his massive income.

663
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,310
Not on a Navy salary.

664
00:34:32,394 --> 00:34:34,753
He had to launder it,
so he got a little help from his

665
00:34:34,837 --> 00:34:36,861
bar honey/accountant, Drew Turner.

666
00:34:36,945 --> 00:34:38,678
They created the fictitious
George Kaplan,

667
00:34:38,762 --> 00:34:41,143
then they ran the money
through the brokerage account,

668
00:34:41,227 --> 00:34:43,532
- so they could make it legal.
- It was brilliant.

669
00:34:45,402 --> 00:34:46,884
Until it went sideways.

670
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:12,778
Hi.

671
00:35:13,647 --> 00:35:14,361
Cute?

672
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:16,781
He has a great personality.

673
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,201
You want to hold him?

674
00:35:28,248 --> 00:35:29,794
Do I know you from somewhere?

675
00:35:30,758 --> 00:35:31,921
I don't think so.

676
00:35:37,412 --> 00:35:39,220
The dog park on 11th, right?

677
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:41,472
I've never been there.

678
00:35:42,326 --> 00:35:43,724
You sure look familiar.

679
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:49,202
Are you looking
to rescue a pet today?

680
00:35:51,738 --> 00:35:53,442
I was just window-shopping.

681
00:35:53,656 --> 00:35:56,369
But I really admire
what you do here.

682
00:35:57,899 --> 00:35:59,661
I love your dog collar.

683
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,788
We have a pit bull terrier
that has one just like it.

684
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,602
Come take a look.

685
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,580
You'll get a kick out of her.

686
00:36:08,256 --> 00:36:09,125
Come on.

687
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,123
The vote's in a couple days.

688
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:18,160
I have better things to do
than be dragged back to NCIS.

689
00:36:18,244 --> 00:36:19,944
We had a break in the case.

690
00:36:20,028 --> 00:36:22,262
Why don't you just tell me
what it is?

691
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,739
"Interrogation Room"?

692
00:36:28,602 --> 00:36:30,020
That doesn't sound good.

693
00:36:32,452 --> 00:36:33,524
Oh. Sorry.

694
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,703
Did not know this room was used.

695
00:36:35,787 --> 00:36:37,973
Not a problem.
Just finishing up here.

696
00:36:38,546 --> 00:36:39,995
You know Nick Sandlock.

697
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:45,711
We were just talking about Stembridge,
kickbacks and Swiss banks.

698
00:36:50,072 --> 00:36:51,445
We can talk in here.

699
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,627
Bye-bye.

700
00:37:00,922 --> 00:37:02,241
Special Agent McGee.

701
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,011
You look like you may need to sit down,
Commander.

702
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,010
Sounded like a pretty sweet plan
till Drew Turner got in trouble.

703
00:37:12,302 --> 00:37:14,021
What was it, Costa Rica?

704
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:15,774
Her gambling?

705
00:37:18,664 --> 00:37:20,134
She was addicted to it.

706
00:37:20,669 --> 00:37:23,490
When did you realize she was using
your money to pay off her bets?

707
00:37:25,103 --> 00:37:27,661
When you said "George Kaplan"
took out a hit on me.

708
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,767
Drew was the only other person
who knew that name.

709
00:37:31,851 --> 00:37:34,501
With you dead, she'd have access
to everything in the account.

710
00:37:37,278 --> 00:37:39,645
The greedy bitch used
the money to have me killed.

711
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,721
That why you ditched Ziva?

712
00:37:42,834 --> 00:37:44,303
So you could go after her?

713
00:37:46,213 --> 00:37:48,390
I was putting that money away
for my daughter.

714
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:52,680
For her future needs.

715
00:38:04,698 --> 00:38:07,390
I think this is where I tell you
I need to talk to a lawyer.

716
00:38:35,335 --> 00:38:36,730
Door's unlocked, Abs.

717
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,384
Hi, Gibbs.

718
00:38:43,597 --> 00:38:44,306
So?

719
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,941
- You see the guy?
- Kyle?

720
00:38:47,361 --> 00:38:48,464
My brother?

721
00:38:48,548 --> 00:38:49,275
Yeah.

722
00:38:52,947 --> 00:38:54,164
How'd it go?

723
00:38:54,645 --> 00:38:55,672
It was fine.

724
00:38:56,202 --> 00:38:57,584
I didn't tell him who I was.

725
00:38:58,651 --> 00:39:00,955
He seems really, really nice.

726
00:39:01,265 --> 00:39:02,730
He doesn't need the added stress.

727
00:39:02,814 --> 00:39:05,952
He just got chosen to donate a kidney,
and the operation's tomorrow.

728
00:39:06,036 --> 00:39:08,978
I have things I have to work out,
you know?

729
00:39:09,778 --> 00:39:11,052
Are you drinking tea?

730
00:39:12,176 --> 00:39:12,933
Yeah.

731
00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:16,057
Don't tell Ducky.
He'll give me a lecture on brewing.

732
00:39:17,754 --> 00:39:19,699
What do you need to work out?

733
00:39:23,282 --> 00:39:25,498
This whole brother-sister thing.

734
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,545
It didn't make any sense to me.

735
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:32,118
Kyle and me...
our DNA is a total match.

736
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:35,331
So, we have to have
the same biological parents.

737
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,048
So then I was like,

738
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:39,798
what did they give him up
for adoption?

739
00:39:40,518 --> 00:39:42,004
And I can't imagine,

740
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,910
the wonderful, loving parents

741
00:39:44,994 --> 00:39:48,077
that raised me and Luca
ever giving up a child.

742
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,972
But they would have adopted a child.

743
00:39:53,543 --> 00:39:54,581
And they did.

744
00:39:56,308 --> 00:39:57,017
Me.

745
00:40:02,252 --> 00:40:03,668
I'm adopted, Gibbs.

746
00:40:04,717 --> 00:40:05,861
How do you know that?

747
00:40:11,972 --> 00:40:13,494
This is my mom's hair.

748
00:40:14,605 --> 00:40:18,605
And I ran a DNA test on it
and I compared it to mine.

749
00:40:20,563 --> 00:40:22,461
It wasn't a biological match, Gibbs.

750
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,006
So I...

751
00:40:25,463 --> 00:40:28,014
I don't know who I am anymore.

752
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:31,512
I don't know who my parents were.

753
00:40:32,678 --> 00:40:33,845
I'm just like...

754
00:40:34,797 --> 00:40:36,472
like Little Orphan Abby.

755
00:40:39,305 --> 00:40:41,146
You're still the same person.

756
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,042
Your parents...

757
00:40:44,582 --> 00:40:46,985
they're still your parents,
as you remember them.

758
00:40:50,835 --> 00:40:54,435
Family's more than just... DNA.

759
00:40:57,627 --> 00:40:58,580
It's about...

760
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:03,336
people who care
and take care of each other.

761
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:04,654
I know.

762
00:41:06,943 --> 00:41:10,551
But why didn't they tell me
I was adopted?

763
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,691
I mean, there's got to be a reason.

764
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,870
And I need to find out before,

765
00:41:17,702 --> 00:41:21,112
I completely turn Luca
and Kyle's lives upside down.

766
00:41:24,305 --> 00:41:26,522
You don't have to do this alone,
Abby.

767
00:41:29,413 --> 00:41:30,624
You've got a family.

768
00:41:32,514 --> 00:41:34,074
And we'll help you through it.
