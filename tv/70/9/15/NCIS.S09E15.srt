1
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,546
我要订一束玫瑰
I'd like to order roses, a dozen.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,949
在卡片上写 "我昨晚很开心"就好
Just put: "I had a great time last night" on the card.

3
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:11,418
别署名 能否找个人帮忙
Don't sign it. Actually, is there anyway to get someone

4
00:00:11,452 --> 00:00:14,087
在卡片上印上个唇印?
to put a lipstick kiss on the gift card?

5
00:00:14,122 --> 00:00:15,389
这听着很有趣啊
That sounds interesting.

6
00:00:15,423 --> 00:00:17,057
更像是勾引
More like contagious.

7
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:18,968
她都送了一个礼拜了...
She sends almost one a week...

8
00:00:18,993 --> 00:00:20,949
每次都是不同的男人
each time to a different guy.

9
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:22,495
这是最后一个吗?
Is that the last one?

10
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,997
我实在等不及想出去了
I'm itching to get going tonight.

11
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:26,000
工作了一天...我实在是需要放松一下
Rough day at work...I need to burn off some steam.

12
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,672
就等着最后一个了
Just one more.

13
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:30,202
你好 我想订束花
Hi. I'm calling to order flowers

14
00:00:30,237 --> 00:00:31,303
葬礼用的
for a funeral.

15
00:00:31,338 --> 00:00:33,105
附上一张素雅一些的卡片就行
I just need something simple on the card.

16
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,408
但愿不是 "我昨晚很开心"
Hope it's not "I had a great time last night."

17
00:00:35,442 --> 00:00:37,176
就写 "墨菲 你和你朋友觉得
Just put: "Did you and your friend think

18
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,678
我找不到你们了是吗? 我跟你说过 
I wouldn't find you, Murphy? Told you I'd get you

19
00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:41,580
天涯海角我也要找到你"
when you least expected it."

20
00:00:43,016 --> 00:00:44,550
这是个恶作剧吧...
If that's a joke...

21
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,458
NCIS 第九季第十五集

22
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,458
- 抱歉... - 难以置信!
- Sorry... - Unbelievable!

23
00:01:24,492 --> 00:01:26,225
你看哭泣的游戏了?
You finally saw The Crying Game?

24
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,495
- 没! 我得了张超速罚单 - 哦
- No! I got a speeding ticket. - Ooh.

25
00:01:28,529 --> 00:01:29,863
你知道这代表什么嘛 麦基?
You know what that means, McGee?

26
00:01:29,897 --> 00:01:31,465
- 交通系统很管用 -我只是在限速范围内
- The system works. - I was barely going

27
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:32,666
超了一点点而已
over the limit.

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,067
让我瞧瞧
Let me see.

29
00:01:35,837 --> 00:01:37,937
这上面可是说你在限速40的路上跑的80啊
It says you were doing 80 in a 40.

30
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:38,978
又不是一直跑的80
Not the entire time.

31
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:40,253
你跟他说你是个联邦探员了吗?
You tell him you're a federal agent?

32
00:01:40,273 --> 00:01:41,707
- 什么意思? - 呃 有时候吧
- Excuse me? - Well, sometimes,

33
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:43,776
如果他们知道你是联邦探员的话 他们会另眼相看
if they know, they look the other way.

34
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,077
"噢 不好意思这是我的警徽"
"Oh, that's not my wallet."

35
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:47,480
- 等等 你经常这么干? - 告诉你个小秘密
- Wait. You do that often? - With one notable exception.

36
00:01:47,514 --> 00:01:49,582
在过去的17年里我都没有拿过罚单
I haven't gotten a speeding ticket in 17 years.

37
00:01:49,616 --> 00:01:50,816
也没有因为违章停车被罚过
Or paid for parking,

38
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:51,951
足球比赛也没有...
football games...

39
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:53,785
这就是个灰色领域
It's a gray area.

40
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:55,086
有时候我甚至还
Sometimes I even get

41
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,188
能吃到免费甜品和咖啡
my donuts and coffee for free.

42
00:01:58,924 --> 00:02:00,391
我可不觉得吉布斯同意你这么干
I do not think Gibbs would approve.

43
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:02,894
只要吉布斯不知道 不就行了
What Gibbs doesn't know won't hurt him.

44
00:02:02,928 --> 00:02:04,161
我不知道什么 蒂诺佐?
What don't I know, DiNozzo?

45
00:02:04,196 --> 00:02:06,230
嗯 姬娃被开罚单了
Um, Ziva got a speeding ticket.

46
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:10,734
还有我...有时候有免费咖啡可以喝
And I... sometimes get coffee for free.

47
00:02:10,768 --> 00:02:12,603
但我给的小费很多
But I tip big.

48
00:02:12,637 --> 00:02:14,605
好吧 来打吧
All right, let's have it.

49
00:02:15,773 --> 00:02:17,741
走吧 发现海军上尉的尸体
Let's go. Dead navy captain.

50
00:02:20,277 --> 00:02:21,612
你觉不觉得他被吉布斯
Do you ever get the feeling that

51
00:02:21,646 --> 00:02:23,013
拍脑勺的时候特别享受啊?
he enjoys being smacked in the head?

52
00:02:23,047 --> 00:02:25,481
我宁愿想都不要想
I'd rather not think about it.

53
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:29,102
两枪
Two shots.

54
00:02:29,127 --> 00:02:30,661
嗯 动静肯定不小
Yep. They must have made some noise.

55
00:02:30,888 --> 00:02:31,888
的确
They did.

56
00:02:31,922 --> 00:02:33,823
有几个 呃 几个目击者听见了枪响
Several, uh, witnesses heard the gunshots.

57
00:02:33,857 --> 00:02:36,258
在大街上发现了弹壳
Found the brass in the street.

58
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:37,860
就没有人报警吗?
No one called the police?

59
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:39,662
姬娃 在这地方 枪战可不是
Gunshots aren't exactly news

60
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:42,531
什么新闻
in the this neighborhood, Ziva.

61
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:43,999
清洁工发现了尸体
Cleaning lady found the body.

62
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:46,001
打电话报警 警察就找我们就来了
She called the cops, they called us.

63
00:02:46,702 --> 00:02:49,337
保险箱被撬了
Safe's picked.

64
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:51,305
这是什么? 指甲?
What are these? Fingernails?

65
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,609
这保险柜里的东西肯定很重要
Somebody was nervous about something.

66
00:02:54,644 --> 00:02:56,310
抱歉我来晚了
Sorry I was late.

67
00:02:56,345 --> 00:02:59,613
我得等到帕摩先生办完事回来
Been waiting for Mr. Palmer to return from an errand.

68
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:01,782
-我才能过来 -什么情况?
- I had to leave without him. - What errand?

69
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:04,317
布瑞娜打电话来了
Brrrreena called.

70
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:07,054
他们筹备婚礼时请的那个
The wedding caterer they planned on using

71
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:08,822
宴会承包人出差了
had gone out of business.

72
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:11,058
那哭声能把死人哭活了
The sobs almost woke the dead.

73
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:12,125
那她真是挺伤心的?
She pretty upset?

74
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,826
哭的那个人可不是她
She wasn't the one crying.

75
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:17,455
现在什么情况?
What do we have here?

76
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:19,899
嗯 躺在这的是杰克・瓦里斯上校
Well, over here, you got Captain Jack Wallace and,

77
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:21,734
那么 躺在这儿的是他朋友德克斯特・墨菲
of course, our friend here is Dexter Murphy.

78
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:23,436
看起来像是起入室抢劫案
Looks like an open-and-shut robbery.

79
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,130
- 我猜你还会来个"不过" - 呃 不过听这个
- Do I suspect a "but"? - Uh, but this.

80
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,507
你好 我想订束花
Hi. I'm calling to order flowers

81
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,076
葬礼上用的
for a funeral.

82
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,178
附上一张素雅一些的卡片就行
I just need something simple on the card.

83
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:36,314
就写 "墨菲 你和你朋友觉得
Just put: "Did you and your friend think I wouldn't

84
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:38,383
我找不到你们了是吗? 我跟你说过 
find you, Murphy? Told you I'd get you

85
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:39,517
天涯海角我也会找到你"
when you least expected it."

86
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,152
某个男人的留言
A man of his word.

87
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,588
是啊
Yeah.

88
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:43,855
我大概明白了
So I can see.

89
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,091
能初步断定案件发生的原因
The preliminary cause of death is obvious,

90
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,825
但是我还是...
but I think I will...

91
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:49,961
保留意见
reserve judgment.

92
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,298
-看看我们发现了什么? - 达克
- What do we have here? - Duck.

93
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,501
天呐 Duckman内衣
Holy undergarments, Duckman.

94
00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:58,136
是我想的那样吗?
Is that what I think it is?

95
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:08,252
他是杰克・瓦里斯上校
His name is Captain Jack Wallace.

96
00:04:08,286 --> 00:04:10,721
他是伊战老兵 还有就是 
He's a decorated Iraq veteran, and he's also

97
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:12,289
他是一个现实生活中的超级英雄
a Real-Life Superhero.

98
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:14,124
- 一个啥? -他们这样称呼他
- A what? - That's what they're called.

99
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:16,091
- 谁们? -他们自己
- By who? - By themselves.

100
00:04:16,126 --> 00:04:17,993
他们没有真正的神奇力量
They don't claim to have actual superpowers.

101
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:19,928
肯定的 他们真有的话那才叫诡异了呢
Right, 'cause that would be weird.

102
00:04:19,963 --> 00:04:22,431
不 他们只是一个活动团体
No, they're really just community activists.

103
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:24,500
穿上服装 监视社区
They put on costumes and do neighborhood watches,

104
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:27,136
提供公共服务 有时候还组织募捐
community service, sometimes even fund-raising.

105
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,438
- 还真不赖 是吧? -嘿 我说他们组织生日派对吗?
- Pretty cool, huh? - Hey, do they do birthday parties?

106
00:04:29,473 --> 00:04:33,141
监视社区是Solanum负责进行的
Neighborhood watches were Solanum's specialty.

107
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:35,209
- 谁? - 德克斯特・墨菲
- Who? - Dexter Murphy,

108
00:04:35,244 --> 00:04:37,445
那个店主... 他扮的超级英雄叫Solanum
the store owner... his Superhero name was Solanum.

109
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,481
瓦里斯上校的代号是 Code队长
Captain Wallace went by Captain Code.

110
00:04:39,515 --> 00:04:42,350
他是负责居民楼内的密码情况
His specialty building-code violations.

111
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:45,287
我还发现他们在保卫地球超级英雄网站上注册了
I found them registered at EarthSuperHeroUnion.com

112
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:46,620
他们也有网站?
They have a Web site, too?

113
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:48,589
哦 这就是他们的网站 还有他们的活动小组
Oh, there's Web sites, there's community groups,

114
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:51,191
他们甚至讨论是否成立一个裁判小组
there's even talk of creating a sanctioning body,

115
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:52,259
就像NBA一样
like the NBA.

116
00:04:52,294 --> 00:04:54,361
不过 当一个现实生活种的超级英雄也是非常危险的
Of course, being an RLSH can be dangerous, too.

117
00:04:54,396 --> 00:04:56,963
尤其是 当涉及到一些犯罪行为
Especially if you're getting involved with the criminal stuff...

118
00:04:56,998 --> 00:04:58,198
像是非法涂鸦
going after

119
00:04:58,232 --> 00:04:59,566
还有盗窃行为
graffiti taggers, muggers.

120
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:02,302
所以 当他们有难了 他们就打电话报警?
So, when these guys get in trouble, they call the cops?

121
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,403
有些会 有些不会
Some do, some don't.

122
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:04,937
那他们还是挺机警
So, they're like vigilantes.

123
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,539
是莽撞吧
Nerd vigilantes.

124
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,240
问题是 他们是不是因为这些才被杀死的?
Question is, did it get them killed?

125
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,095
语音留言很明显是杀手在暗示
The voice mail clearly indicates the killer

126
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,336
他要来寻仇了
was seeking revenge.

127
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,112
为了什么?
For what?

128
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,915
我去查电话记录
The phone records.

129
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,617
-我去查上级指挥官 -我去查电子邮箱 谷歌邮箱 微博
- A commanding officer. - E-mails, G-mails, Twitter.

130
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,421
米勒小姐 我们就这么说定了?
So, do we have a deal or not, Ms. Miller?

131
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,356
呃 这要看你的探员了
Well, that's gonna depend on your agent.

132
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,724
这可不太好啊
That doesn't sound good.

133
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,492
吉布斯探员
Agent Gibbs,

134
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,194
-我向你介绍... -还在
- I'd like you to meet... - Still working

135
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,262
晚报工作? - 国际新闻部
for the Evening Tribune? - The Globe.

136
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:33,665
你们认识?
You two know each other?

137
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,333
天呐 告诉我你们没结过婚
Oh, please tell me that you weren't married.

138
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:37,034
没有
No.

139
00:05:37,068 --> 00:05:38,703
但是我们的确有一段过去
But we go back.

140
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:39,770
哦 好吧
Oh, good.

141
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:41,605
这就让事情变得更简单了
That should make things easier.

142
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,273
也许更糟
Or worse.

143
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:46,677
我会处理好的 可以开始了吗?
I'll manage. Shall we?

144
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:48,412
瓦里斯上校两天前
Captain Wallace called me

145
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:51,013
往报社打电话 想跟我见一面
at my paper two days ago, wanted to meet.

146
00:05:51,048 --> 00:05:52,915
- 为了什么? -不能说
- About what? - Wouldn't say.

147
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,819
不过那套超级英雄的服装肯定暗示着一些什么
But that superhero costume sure says something.

148
00:05:57,187 --> 00:06:00,457
- 我什么都没说 - 别忘了 我可是记者
- I didn't tell her. - I am a reporter, remember?

149
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:02,759
他想告诉你什么?
So, what's the story?

150
00:06:02,793 --> 00:06:04,694
瓦里斯正在接手一个非能源部
Wallace ran a classified program

151
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:06,362
下达的秘密任务
out of the Department of Energy,

152
00:06:06,396 --> 00:06:09,465
护送核废料到热点地区
securing rogue nuclear materials in hot-spot areas.

153
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:11,800
那里对钱苏联铀的需求量很大
There's a big demand for old Soviet uranium.

154
00:06:11,835 --> 00:06:13,769
机密文件 里昂
File's classified, Leon.

155
00:06:13,803 --> 00:06:16,004
这文件是她的 可不是我的
That file is hers. It's not mine.

156
00:06:17,306 --> 00:06:18,774
记者的好处
Reporter.

157
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:20,809
如果爆出一个这么重大的消息
Press is gonna have a field day with this one.

158
00:06:20,844 --> 00:06:22,009
你肯定能想象出头条会是什么样的
I'm sure you can imagine the headline.

159
00:06:22,034 --> 00:06:23,110
嗯
Hmm.

160
00:06:23,111 --> 00:06:24,645
"海军军官在护送核武器途中
"Navy officer in charge of nukes

161
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,848
被发现身着超级英雄服装暴毙而亡"
found dead in superhero costume."

162
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:28,850
很拗口 不过我喜欢
Wordy, but I like it.

163
00:06:28,884 --> 00:06:29,684
我不喜欢
I don't.

164
00:06:29,718 --> 00:06:31,753
不管怎么说
However,

165
00:06:31,787 --> 00:06:33,755
米勒小姐同意在你破案之前
Ms. Miller has agreed to hold off

166
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:35,155
不发表相关文章
till you conduct your investigation.

167
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,758
你上司希望你能发现
Your director hopes that you'll find something

168
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:40,360
该怎么说 更出彩的东西来
that paints things in a more, shall we say, favorable light.

169
00:06:40,395 --> 00:06:43,530
作为交换我们会给你第一手的资料
In exchange for first dibs on any info we do uncover.

170
00:06:43,564 --> 00:06:46,366
哦 还有NCIS的线人 以便给我所需要的消息
Oh, plus a liaison from NCIS to keep me in the loop.

171
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:48,268
吉布斯探员 就是你了
And you're that liaison, Agent Gibbs.

172
00:06:48,302 --> 00:06:51,137
我相信你的专业水准
I trust that you'll handle the matter professionally.

173
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
我的老天爷!
Oh, my God!

174
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:56,675
艾比 不介意我在这儿躲起来歇一会儿吧?
Abby, do you mind if I hide down here?

175
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,310
麦基快把我搞疯了...
McGee is driving me crazy with all...

176
00:07:01,014 --> 00:07:02,848
小野猫 这又是哪一出?
What's new, pussycat?

177
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:04,016
你听见我说的了吧
I guess you heard.

178
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,851
呃 关于现实生活种的超级英雄?
Um, about the Real- Life Superheroes?

179
00:07:05,886 --> 00:07:07,853
喂!我可是为了联系上
Hello! I've been trying to meet

180
00:07:07,888 --> 00:07:09,388
Cataonic花了几个月的时间啊
Catatonic for, like, months.

181
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:10,955
他拯救动物 大部分是猫
He rescues animals, mostly cats.

182
00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:12,490
他在庇护所里就像
And he's like a rock star

183
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:14,125
摇滚明星一样火
in the shelter community.

184
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:16,594
现在我们法庭需要一个摇滚明星
Right now we need a rock star in the forensic community.

185
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:18,763
我正在研究你在保险柜找到的
I am making some progress on the chewed fingernails

186
00:07:18,798 --> 00:07:20,131
那些凶手咬下来的指甲
that you found at the safe.

187
00:07:20,165 --> 00:07:21,599
可能 就是 有的...
Maybe, like, some...

188
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:24,268
有的凶手开锁时比较紧张才会咬指甲
some nervous murderer trying to pick a lock

189
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:26,103
我正在做DNA配对 不过...
I'm running the DNA now, but...

190
00:07:26,138 --> 00:07:29,105
我有重大发现
my big find was online.

191
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,374
我发现这个徽章 看起来很眼熟
I noticed this insignia, and it looked familiar.

192
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,144
然后我想起来我是从哪儿看来的了
And then I remembered where I knew it from.

193
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:37,347
六个月前一场酒吧斗殴事件
There was a bar fight uploaded to CyberVid

194
00:07:37,381 --> 00:07:38,715
被传到在CyberVid网
six months ago.

195
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,584
我可不想找麻烦 你想怎么样?
I don't want any trouble! You don't want any trouble?

196
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:42,352
不! 真糟糕 是你找到的
No! Too bad 'cause you found it!

197
00:07:42,386 --> 00:07:44,720
你个傻子 是你找到的! 让他走吧!
No, punk, you found it! Let him go!

198
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,756
嘿 老兄 放开我 你个神经病!
Hey, man, let go of me, you freak!

199
00:07:51,227 --> 00:07:53,596
瓦里斯和墨菲拦住了那个肇事者
Wallace and Murphy stopped the bad guy.

200
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,633
耶! 后来这个视频火了
Yay! So, the video went viral,

201
00:07:57,668 --> 00:07:59,835
他们就变成了当地人们的英雄了
and they became local heroes.

202
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:01,970
那个醉鬼...就那个看起来像醉鬼的
The drunk idiot... Looks like a drunk idiot.

203
00:08:02,004 --> 00:08:03,371
好像很忌恨的样子
Maybe he's holding a grudge.

204
00:08:03,405 --> 00:08:04,639
你查到他的身份了吗?
You got an I.D.?

205
00:08:04,674 --> 00:08:07,576
呃 我还无法通过面部识别查到这个人
Well, I haven't had any hits on facial recognition.

206
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,377
那么到底是谁拍下的这个视频?
So, who shot this video?

207
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:13,147
是一个名叫ICU的用户上传的
It was uploaded by a user called ICU.

208
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:16,283
我追踪不到这个人的真实身份
Had trouble tracking that back to an actual person.

209
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:18,686
不过不管是谁 他肯定费劲了心思
Whoever did this went to a lot of trouble

210
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,488
隐藏他的身份
to keep his identity hidden.

211
00:08:20,522 --> 00:08:22,289
走着瞧
Keep looking.

212
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,563
原来你在这儿
There you are.

213
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:32,064
哈! 是啊
Ha! Yeah.

214
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:33,199
哇哦
Wow.

215
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:34,367
你也在这儿
There you are.

216
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:35,768
你来干嘛?
What are you doing there?

217
00:08:35,803 --> 00:08:39,005
吉布斯探员派你担任瓦里斯案子的联络员
Agent Gibbs assigned you to be my liaison on the Wallace case.

218
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,239
噢
Oh.

219
00:08:40,273 --> 00:08:42,074
联络员是什么意思? 
What do you mean, "liaison"?

220
00:08:42,109 --> 00:08:44,844
你现在是个记者
You're a reporter now.

221
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,479
我们不需要...和记者联络
We don't... liaise with reporters.

222
00:08:47,514 --> 00:08:49,347
但是现在你必须这么做
You do now.

223
00:08:49,382 --> 00:08:51,349
吉布斯可没和我说起这事
Gibbs didn't say anything to me about this.

224
00:08:51,384 --> 00:08:53,051
嘿 托尼 托尼 托尼!
Hey, Tony, Tony, Tony!

225
00:08:53,085 --> 00:08:55,020
吉布斯让我转达你...
Gibbs wanted me to tell you that...

226
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:58,524
噢 你好
Oh. Hello.

227
00:08:58,558 --> 00:08:59,992
你好
Hi.

228
00:09:00,026 --> 00:09:02,460
所以...
So...

229
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:04,929
我们要怎么办?
what do we do now?

230
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:06,898
托尼 我也对这件事很不满
Well, I'm not happy about it, either, Tony,

231
00:09:06,932 --> 00:09:08,407
但我希望你拿出你的专业精神来
but I expect you to be professional.

232
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:09,066
我一直很敬业
Always.

233
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:10,267
我们之间没必要搞得像敌人一样
It's not like we're enemies.

234
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:13,237
对啊 我邀请你参加过圣诞聚餐
Exactly. I did invite you to Christmas brunch,

235
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:15,640
而且我们曾经订了婚
and at one point in our lives, we were engaged to be married.

236
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,042
太强悍了
Meow.

237
00:09:19,076 --> 00:09:21,110
我想再打个招呼...
Hi... again.

238
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:22,679
我叫艾比
I'm Abby.

239
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:23,847
我叫温迪
Wendy.

240
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:25,048
温迪!
Wendy!

241
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:27,617
那个前未婚妻 温迪
Wendy the ex-fiancée.

242
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,479
麦基 他们来了 他们来了!
McGee, here they come, here they come!

243
00:09:43,504 --> 00:09:44,346
等等...
Hold on...

244
00:09:44,347 --> 00:09:46,281
头儿! 我们能不能谈一谈?
Boss! Can I talk to you for a second?

245
00:09:46,315 --> 00:09:49,117
噢 温迪 穿过那扇门 走到底
Uh, Wendy, conference room is just through that door,

246
00:09:49,152 --> 00:09:50,147
就是会议室 麻烦你先走
there at the end. Thanks.

247
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:51,649
让我当温迪的联络员? 你想什么呢?
I'm Wendy's liaison? What were you thinking?

248
00:09:51,683 --> 00:09:54,552
你就跟她说事情有变 我...
You were there when it went south. I c...

249
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:55,886
不行
Sorry.

250
00:09:57,288 --> 00:09:58,755
抱歉
Sorry.

251
00:10:19,342 --> 00:10:20,942
我们要专业地对待这事儿吧
Aren't we professional.

252
00:10:20,977 --> 00:10:23,011
当然
That's what we are.

253
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:25,313
恩 我们从基本的开始
Okay, let's start with the basics.

254
00:10:25,348 --> 00:10:27,039
你以前和瓦里斯相识吗? 不
Have you ever spoken with Wallace before? no

255
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,284
知道他为何在死前打给你?
Have any idea what his call was about?

256
00:10:29,318 --> 00:10:30,425
不知道
Nope.

257
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,540
你为什么邀请我去圣诞聚餐?
Why'd you invite me to Christmas brunch?

258
00:10:32,688 --> 00:10:34,489
我以为看到你会很高兴
Thought it might be nice to see you.

259
00:10:34,523 --> 00:10:35,890
可能我错了
I may have been wrong.

260
00:10:37,393 --> 00:10:40,327
- 轮到我了 - 轮到你干嘛?
- My turn. - Your turn what?

261
00:10:40,362 --> 00:10:41,696
我要问几个问题
I get to ask some questions.

262
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,163
那是我和旺斯的协议
That's my deal with Vance.

263
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:47,434
瓦利斯上校有精神病史吗?
Does Captain Wallace have a history of mental illness?

264
00:10:47,435 --> 00:10:49,235
没有
No.

265
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,305
那你们海军知道他在偷偷扮英雄吗?
Was the navy aware that he was moonlighting as a... Superhero?

266
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:53,540
不知道
No.

267
00:10:53,574 --> 00:10:55,909
你什么时候开始穿上千元的西装?
Since when did you start wearing thousand-dollar suits?

268
00:10:55,943 --> 00:10:58,177
你什么时候不再教4岁的小孩子唱
Since when did you stop teaching four-year-olds how to sing

269
00:10:58,212 --> 00:11:00,881
神龙帕夫 继而转型成超人妻子?
"Puff the Magic Dragon" and start channeling Lois Lane?

270
00:11:00,915 --> 00:11:02,748
人总是会变的
People change.

271
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,917
是啊 他们是的
Yes, they do.

272
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:06,385
我没有错
I wasn't wrong.

273
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,387
很高兴能见到你
It is nice to see you.

274
00:11:09,956 --> 00:11:11,924
我也是
It's nice to see you, too.

275
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,659
恩
Mm.

276
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:20,966
得了吧 这是我发明的
Come on. I invented that.

277
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,367
呃 我们来只是想跟你说
Well, we just wanted to let you know

278
00:11:22,402 --> 00:11:24,836
艾比还无法确定上传那个打架视频的
that Abby's still unable to identify the user

279
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,904
用户的身份
who uploaded that fight video.

280
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:27,139
噢
Oh.

281
00:11:27,173 --> 00:11:28,373
吉布斯希望我们调查下周围居民
Gibbs wants us to canvas the neighborhood.

282
00:11:28,408 --> 00:11:31,276
看有没有人认识那个酒鬼
See if anyone knows who the drunk idiot is.

283
00:11:31,311 --> 00:11:32,510
噢 那个人我不认识 但我知道那个视频
Oh, I don't know him, but that video

284
00:11:32,545 --> 00:11:34,446
是一个叫克莱恩斯・托百特的人拍的
was shot by a man name Clarence Tobett.

285
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,546
本地信托基金的宠儿
Local trust-fund baby,

286
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,748
经营反对帮派的业务
runs an anti-gang outreach program.

287
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:39,116
- 我是个记者 - 记者
- Reporter. - Reporter.

288
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:40,985
他总是会写一些东西
He's always calling the paper,

289
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:42,686
以引起民众注意
trying to drum up publicity.

290
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,921
谢谢
Thank you.

291
00:11:43,956 --> 00:11:45,957
恩 记得告诉我你们的新发现
Hm. Let me know what you find.

292
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:48,993
她人很好啊
She is cute.

293
00:11:49,027 --> 00:11:50,261
打住
Stop it.

294
00:11:53,197 --> 00:11:56,399
你的前未婚妻很可爱啊
Your ex-fiancée's really cute.

295
00:11:56,434 --> 00:11:57,934
和我想的大相径庭啊
But I would expect no less.

296
00:11:57,969 --> 00:12:00,470
这么多年后相见 感觉很陌生吧?
Must be strange seeing her again after all these years, huh?

297
00:12:00,504 --> 00:12:01,704
尤其是在她离婚后?
Especially with her divorced?

298
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:05,041
你居然不吭声
Almost as strange as you not talking.

299
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:07,376
我在工作 你投入点 谢谢了
I'm working. You should try it. Thank you.

300
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:11,280
你是克莱恩斯 托百特?
Clarence Tobett?

301
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,481
你们是?
Who wants to know?

302
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:14,984
海军罪案调查处!
NCIS!

303
00:12:15,018 --> 00:12:17,719
我们在找拍这段视频的人
We're looking for the man who shot this video.

304
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:24,993
你们怎么找到我的?
How'd you find me?

305
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:27,695
我花了好大劲儿隐藏身份
I work very hard to keep my true identity a secret.

306
00:12:27,729 --> 00:12:29,998
噢 咔嚓!
Oh, snap!

307
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:32,933
你是他们中的一个!
You're one of them!

308
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:35,769
如果你是指现实生活超级英雄 那就对了
If you mean Real-Life Superhero, then, yes.

309
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:39,539
让我猜猜 你是ICU?
Let me guess. ICU?

310
00:12:39,573 --> 00:12:41,541
是 这也是你们过来
That's right, 'cause that's where you go

311
00:12:41,575 --> 00:12:42,809
调查我的原因吧
if you mess with me.

312
00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:47,114
鉴于我们...
Since we're...

313
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:48,281
是同行
coworkers,

314
00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:49,649
我会充分配合你们
you will have my complete cooperation.

315
00:12:49,683 --> 00:12:51,151
是 是我拍了那段视频
Yes, I shot the video.

316
00:12:51,185 --> 00:12:53,953
我在当罪犯诱饵时遇到这起事件的
I came upon the fight when I was out on bait patrol.

317
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:55,121
罪犯诱饵?
Bait patrol?

318
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:58,090
对 一种专业的引诱打击罪犯的策略
Yes, it's a standard crime-fighting tactic.

319
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,126
我们中的某个人...别 别 别
One of us... No, no, no, no, no, no.

320
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,995
...扮成诱饵 等待
...acts as bait, and waits

321
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,430
罪犯上钩
for someone to cause trouble.

322
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,665
他们一旦有所行动 我们就进行反击
When they do, we give it to them.

323
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:08,034
- 克莱恩斯! - 噢!
- Clarence! - Oh!

324
00:13:08,068 --> 00:13:10,569
我什么时候允许你把汤姆借走了?
What did I tell you about borrowing Tom?

325
00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:12,437
- 我... - 不!
- I... - No!

326
00:13:12,471 --> 00:13:13,505
不 不 不!
No, no, no!

327
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:16,541
佩顿小姐说你们是NCIS的人
Miss Peyton said you're from NCIS.

328
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:18,076
他犯了什么事?
What did he do now?

329
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,344
爸 没事
Nothing, Dad.

330
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:22,480
事实上 是你打断了我们 我们在说正事
In fact, if you'll excuse us, this is business.

331
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:24,749
不 不 我在做的才叫正事
No, no. Business is what I do.

332
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:26,384
而你只是在花我给你的钱而已
I buy real estate, you just take it up.

333
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:29,086
25岁的人了还像5岁小孩一样!
Acting like you're five, instead of 25!

334
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,954
他到底干了些什么?
What did he do?

335
00:13:30,988 --> 00:13:33,057
噢 他其实是在帮我指认这个人
Oh, he was actually helping us identify someone.

336
00:13:33,091 --> 00:13:34,391
我记得这个人
I remember him.

337
00:13:34,426 --> 00:13:36,593
虽然我不知道他的名字
I don't have a name,

338
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:39,563
但他逃走的时候我记下了他的牌照
but I got his license plate when he fled.

339
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:40,797
呃 部分车牌号
Well, some of it.

340
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:43,732
够了 就此打住 不许再把汤姆借走!
All right, I've heard enough. No more Tom!

341
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:46,001
他是个强手 不能来陪你浪费时间
The guy's got a Bronze Star, for Pete's sake.

342
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:47,303
他才是真正的英雄
He's a real hero.

343
00:13:48,905 --> 00:13:51,006
他就是气我
He's just pissed because I refuse

344
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,209
不接手家族产业
to go into the family business.

345
00:13:53,243 --> 00:13:55,044
我猜也是这样
I can relate.

346
00:13:56,046 --> 00:13:57,413
克莱恩斯?
Clarence?

347
00:13:57,448 --> 00:14:00,182
- 克莱恩斯! -干嘛?
- Clarence! - What?

348
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:02,217
- 车牌号? - 噢
- License plate? - Oh.

349
00:14:04,687 --> 00:14:06,388
三个数字
Three numbers.

350
00:14:06,422 --> 00:14:09,458
超强记忆该不会是你的超级能力吧
I guess super memory isn't one of your superpowers.

351
00:14:09,492 --> 00:14:13,228
随你取笑 但我做的事是正紧事
Make all the fun you want, but what I do is important.

352
00:14:13,262 --> 00:14:15,963
上个礼拜我成功说服一个孩子脱离犯罪组织
I talked a kid out of a gang just last week.

353
00:14:15,997 --> 00:14:18,799
我知道我们的服装很傻逼 但这只是个噱头而已
I know the costumes seem silly, but they're just a gimmick.

354
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,934
服装是为了缓解紧张的气氛
They help defuse tense situations.

355
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:23,537
我不知道Code队长的真实身份
Look, I don't know Captain Code's true identity.

356
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,273
我觉得我们还是继续让它是个谜比较好
It's best that we keep them secret, even from each other,

357
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:28,609
我听到了一些关于他的流言
but I did hear a rumor that something happened to him.

358
00:14:28,643 --> 00:14:30,444
不知道会不会对你们有帮助
I don't know if this helps you, but

359
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:32,312
他说他遇到了情况
he had mentioned that he was onto something.

360
00:14:32,346 --> 00:14:34,214
不过没说清楚是什么事 反正...
He didn't say what, but it...

361
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,216
他很担心
had him worried.

362
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,050
这是我的名片
Here's my card.

363
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,919
如果你们想要那种t恤的话
I have T-shirts, too,

364
00:14:39,953 --> 00:14:42,021
我也有
if you want them.

365
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:43,423
谢谢 谢谢你了
Thank you. Thank you.

366
00:14:43,457 --> 00:14:44,924
恩
Mm-hmm.

367
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:51,930
我年轻那会 也有真实生活中的超级英雄
We had our own real-life superhero in my youth.

368
00:14:51,964 --> 00:14:56,568
他把自己叫做The Fox 是个最早的环境学家的名字
He called himself "The Fox," one of the first environmentalists.

369
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:59,704
有一次 他从污水区
Once, he collected 50 gallons of sewage

370
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:03,241
收集了50加仑的废水
that was destroying a lake, broke into the...

371
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:05,476
把它们泼到了
the offending corporation's offices,

372
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:07,077
排出这些污水公司的办公大厅
and dumped it in their lobby.

373
00:15:08,514 --> 00:15:10,981
每个小孩都在幻想能快点长大
Every child fantasizes about growing up

374
00:15:11,016 --> 00:15:13,251
变成一个超级英雄
and becoming a superhero,

375
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:15,052
但是你确实做到了
but you actually did it.

376
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:17,955
真厉害啊
Impressive.

377
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:19,956
达克 我可不会这么夸他
Not the word I would have chosen, Duck.

378
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,291
你查到了什么?
What do you got?

379
00:15:21,325 --> 00:15:23,726
呃 我觉得这两个人应该是
Uh, I think we can assume that both victims

380
00:15:23,761 --> 00:15:25,094
死于枪杀
died of their gunshot wounds.

381
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:26,396
这很显然
Not surprised.

382
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,365
是啊 让人意外的是我在瓦里斯上校
Yeah, well, the surprise came

383
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,335
身上发现的伤口数量
from the number of injuries I found on Captain Wallace.

384
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,903
他的下巴被打伤两次
He broke his jaw twice.

385
00:15:33,937 --> 00:15:36,572
有多处刀伤
He has scars from numerous knife wounds

386
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:38,674
甚至有枪弹的擦痕
and even has a bullet graze.

387
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:39,741
他在街头打斗过
Doing a little street fighting.

388
00:15:39,776 --> 00:15:41,076
是啊 大概吧
Yeah, well, presumably.

389
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,180
他很认真地在做保卫工作
He took his role as a vigilante quite seriously.

390
00:15:44,214 --> 00:15:45,747
拜托 达克
Come on, Duck.

391
00:15:45,782 --> 00:15:48,184
我想你应该不认同他们的做法吧?
I take it, you do not approve?

392
00:15:48,218 --> 00:15:49,485
达克 这不是他们该做的事
Duck, it's not their job.

393
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,519
他们有可能会受伤
They could get hurt.

394
00:15:50,554 --> 00:15:53,454
杰瑟罗 他们大多数都受伤了
Jethro, most of them already have been.

395
00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:56,524
这些打击罪犯的人除了爱看漫画
Aside from their...their love of comic books,

396
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:58,726
还有个共性 他们愿意
what most of these crime-fighters have in common

397
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,496
牺牲自己
is being victims of violent crime themselves.

398
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,997
付出名誉或是生命
Or abuse or tragedy.

399
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:06,867
你看看瓦里斯上校的资料
I mean, take a look at Captain Wallace.

400
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:08,868
他妻子在分娩时死亡
His wife died in childbirth.

401
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:13,670
之后 她的女儿在购物商场遭遇天台塌陷而死
And then, his daughter died when a balcony collapsed in a shopping mall.

402
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:17,010
麦基说他可是违反建筑条例的老手
McGee said his specialty was building-code violations.

403
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:19,045
这可不是巧合
Well, hardly a coincidence.

404
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,416
然而有一些人会选择陷入忧郁
Whereas others might have succumbed to depression or...

405
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:28,153
或者滥用毒品 而这些人却把内心的忧虑
or drug abuse, these men and women have channeled their angst

406
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:29,422
转化为积极的思绪
into something positive.

407
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,190
谁能来做评价呢?
Who's to judge?

408
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:35,261
但有件事我可能要对你做评价
Though the one thing I might judge you on

409
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:40,232
那就是你让托尼担任新闻媒体的联系员
is your choice of Tony as liaison to the press.

410
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,967
你在打算着什么 杰瑟罗?
What are you up to, Jethro?

411
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,902
谢谢你 谢谢你 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

412
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,771
你们可以不用鼓掌了
You can all hold your applause.

413
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,373
我们为啥可以不用鼓掌了?
For what are we not applauding?

414
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:52,744
我发现了与花店保险箱上吻合的指纹
I got a hit on the DNA from the flower-shop safe.

415
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,512
他叫菲利克斯 昆提罗
His name is Felix Quintero.

416
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:56,647
曾做过街头小太保
He was a small-time hood

417
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:58,349
但现在已经洗手不干了
but seems to have cleaned up his act.

418
00:16:58,383 --> 00:16:59,683
那他现在呢?
So, what's he doing now?

419
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,084
好好听着吧
You're gonna love this.

420
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,353
锁匠
Locksmith

421
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:05,222
他的车牌和你从ICU那里得知的相符合
His license plate matches the partial you got from ICU.

422
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,023
看起来他就是那位醉酒傻子
Looks like he's our drunk idiot.

423
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:08,225
把他带来
Pick him up

424
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,460
这就去
on it

425
00:17:15,766 --> 00:17:18,000
这案子或许马上就能结了
This case may be wrapping up soon.

426
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:19,835
你就不能再见到你的前任了
You will be free from your ex.

427
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,137
我很好 姬娃
I am fine, zive

428
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:23,005
你看起来可不好啊
You do not seem fine.

429
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,940
你看起来...忧郁啊
You seem... pensive.

430
00:17:24,975 --> 00:17:27,576
那是因为我早上吃了辣椒
It's the chili I had for breakfast this morning.

431
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,944
你知道吗 你还从没和我讲过
You know, you have never actually told me how

432
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:31,647
你俩是怎么结束的
it ended between you two.

433
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:36,485
好了 当我没问
Okay, forget I asked.

434
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:37,919
我们被跟踪了
We're being followed.

435
00:17:37,953 --> 00:17:39,954
我有很不好的预感
I had a feeling, a pensive one.

436
00:17:39,989 --> 00:17:41,523
刚才的掉头也证实了这点
U-turn confirmed it.

437
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:44,057
行动吧
Let's move.

438
00:17:45,327 --> 00:17:47,127
NCIS 双手放方向盘上
NCIS! Hands on the wheel!

439
00:17:47,162 --> 00:17:48,629
嘿 注意点
Hey, watch out!

440
00:17:48,664 --> 00:17:50,631
怎么回事啊?
What is going on?

441
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,400
嗨 俩位
Hi, guys.

442
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:54,335
今天是个驾车的好日子 哈?
Great day for a drive, huh?

443
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:55,703
你在干什么呢?
What are you doing?

444
00:17:55,737 --> 00:17:56,570
跟踪线索
Tracking down a lead.

445
00:17:56,605 --> 00:17:58,138
不 我俩才是在跟踪线索
No, we're tracking down a lead.

446
00:17:58,173 --> 00:17:59,439
你是在跟踪我们
You're following us.

447
00:17:59,473 --> 00:18:00,607
什么?难道这犯法吗
What? Is that a crime?

448
00:18:00,641 --> 00:18:01,908
是啊!
Yes!

449
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:03,242
- 准确来说 是的 - 托尼
- Technically, it is. - Tony.

450
00:18:03,277 --> 00:18:05,345
听着 我只是确认能了解第一手信息
Look, I am just making sure I'm in the loop.

451
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:07,084
我说了会告诉你进展的
I told you that I would let you know.

452
00:18:07,682 --> 00:18:09,916
只能说你这承诺这方面
Let's just say you don't have the best track record,

453
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,618
做得确实不怎么好
doing the things you say you're gonna do.

454
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:13,453
说我 你开玩笑吗?
Me?! Are you kidding?

455
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:20,292
我打给消防署吧
I'll call the fire department.

456
00:18:20,327 --> 00:18:22,561
你的车都不喜欢你
Even your car doesn't like you.

457
00:18:23,463 --> 00:18:24,630
我才买的啊
I just got that car.

458
00:18:24,664 --> 00:18:26,332
不可能不喜欢我的
It hasn't had a chance not to like me.

459
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:29,468
车也许喜欢你 可有人并不喜欢
Well, your car may like you, but someone does not.

460
00:18:31,537 --> 00:18:33,471
炸弹被接入燃油管道
It's a bomb wired into the fuel line,

461
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:35,640
在车速驶入50码是自动引爆
timed to go off when the car hit 50.

462
00:18:35,674 --> 00:18:37,342
纸板做得

463
00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:39,543
没错 所以证据会被烧成灰烬
Yeah, so the evidence would burn in the crash,

464
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,078
但制作很匆忙
but it was a rush job.

465
00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:42,512
温迪突然刹车
Wendy's quick stop

466
00:18:42,547 --> 00:18:44,781
导致其松散 加快了
jarred it loose, and the accelerant leaked

467
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:45,916
它接入燃油系统的速率
onto the fuel block,

468
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:47,885
之后便着火 她真幸运的
making it catch on fire. Lucky for her.

469
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,453
幸运 艾比 有人想杀了她
Lucky, Abbs? Someone was trying to kill her.

470
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:51,088
我只是试着乐观点嘛
I'm just trying to be positive.

471
00:18:51,122 --> 00:18:52,890
嘿 准不定是托尼
Hey, maybe it was Tony.

472
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,191
没那可能性
Not positive.

473
00:18:54,226 --> 00:18:56,025
我们找出了更多的信息
Afraid we got a little more of that.

474
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,126
我们发现了这个
We found this.

475
00:18:57,161 --> 00:18:58,561
温迪的笔笔记
It's Wendy's notes.

476
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,630
一些是这个案子的 但还有一些是从
From our current case, but there's also some stuff from

477
00:19:01,665 --> 00:19:03,432
有关她的报纸上截取的
old newspaper stories of hers.

478
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:05,835
还记得她说过不认识瓦里斯上校吗?
Remember she said she didn't know Captain Wallace?

479
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,503
恩
Yeah.

480
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:08,838
根据她的笔记
Well, according to her notes,

481
00:19:08,873 --> 00:19:11,006
她曾和他一起合作过几次
she's worked with him several times in the past.

482
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,774
意味着...
Which means...

483
00:19:12,808 --> 00:19:15,077
她骗了我们
She lied to us.

484
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,119
米勒小姐 我只问你一遍
Miss Miller, I'm only gonna ask you once.

485
00:19:23,154 --> 00:19:24,755
你和瓦里斯上校相识多久了?
How long did you know Captain Wallace?

486
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:25,922
讲过了 我不认识他
I told you, I didn't.

487
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:28,859
根据你的笔记 之前你报导过三则新闻
According to your files, he was a source

488
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:30,994
而他正是消息来源
on three prior news articles of yours.

489
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:32,796
我是个记者 而这些是特权文件
I am a reporter! These are privileged documents!

490
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:35,231
你没有权利看我的笔记
You have no right to look through my notes.

491
00:19:35,265 --> 00:19:36,399
你的笔记
Your notes

492
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:38,300
正是这起谋杀案件的证据 温迪
are evidence in an attempted murder, Wendy.

493
00:19:38,335 --> 00:19:39,802
谋杀你的案件
Yours.

494
00:19:47,277 --> 00:19:50,979
我只是在揭露有关浪费军方开支的报道
I was doing an expose on wasteful military spending.

495
00:19:51,013 --> 00:19:52,146
瓦里斯当时提供线索
Wallace was a source.

496
00:19:52,181 --> 00:19:53,615
如果告诉你们我认识他
If I told you I knew him,

497
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:54,949
你们肯定会查出来的
you'd figure that out.

498
00:19:54,984 --> 00:19:56,651
记者不能揭露他们的线人 不管他生死与否
Reporters do not reveal their sources, dead or alive.

499
00:19:56,686 --> 00:19:59,087
她说实话了没 蒂诺佐探员?
Is she telling the truth, Agent DiNozzo?

500
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,791
抱歉 什么?
I'm sorry. What?

501
00:20:02,825 --> 00:20:04,993
我刚得知你和米勒女士的情史
Just found out about your history with Miss Miller.

502
00:20:05,027 --> 00:20:07,795
有关这个我们稍后详谈
And we'll talk about that later.

503
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:09,630
我想你也许能辨认出来
I figured you might have some incite.

504
00:20:09,664 --> 00:20:11,965
哦 呃..
Oh. Um...

505
00:20:14,903 --> 00:20:16,437
是
Yeah.

506
00:20:16,471 --> 00:20:17,838
她说的都是真的
She's... she's telling the truth.

507
00:20:17,873 --> 00:20:20,140
瓦里斯死之前为何会打给你?
Why did Wallace call you before he was killed?

508
00:20:20,174 --> 00:20:22,475
我想他可能又有什么线索
Well, I assumed he had a lead on another story.

509
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,743
但我真的不知道
But I really don't know.

510
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:25,612
这我没说假话
I-I didn't lie about that.

511
00:20:25,646 --> 00:20:26,746
你肯定知道什么内幕
Well, you obviously know something.

512
00:20:26,781 --> 00:20:28,347
有人想谋杀你
There was an attempt on your life.

513
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:30,249
我发现了 有嫌疑的人吗?
I noticed. You got a suspect?

514
00:20:30,284 --> 00:20:31,818
我们对他的公寓实行监视
We're staking out his apartment.

515
00:20:31,852 --> 00:20:33,252
直到我们找到他 我们可以...
Until we find him, we can...

516
00:20:33,287 --> 00:20:34,521
对我实行保护性监护
Place me in protective custody.

517
00:20:34,555 --> 00:20:36,689
让我进可能地不要插手此事?
And keep me as far away from this story as possible?

518
00:20:36,724 --> 00:20:38,057
不可能
Forget it.

519
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:39,958
我有藏身的地方 我会没事的
I got a place to lay low. I'll be fine.

520
00:20:39,992 --> 00:20:41,993
这我相信 但我
I don't doubt that,, but I'm going to have

521
00:20:42,028 --> 00:20:43,295
还是坚持
to insist on sending an agent

522
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:45,063
派遣一个探员送你回去
to escort you to your destination.

523
00:20:45,097 --> 00:20:46,298
蒂诺佐探员
Agent DiNozzo,

524
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:47,999
考虑你俩的关系 你要愿意
given the circumstances, if you'd like,

525
00:20:48,034 --> 00:20:49,601
我可以派戴维探员
I can assign Agent David.

526
00:20:49,636 --> 00:20:51,537
不可能
No way in hell.

527
00:20:55,741 --> 00:20:57,909
没事的 我搞得定
It's ok. I got it.

528
00:20:59,645 --> 00:21:01,145
你渴了?
You thirsty?

529
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:02,980
要吃点什么吗?
Can I get you something to eat?

530
00:21:03,014 --> 00:21:04,682
我不饿
Not hungry.

531
00:21:04,716 --> 00:21:06,350
你什么时候会不饿了?
Since when are you not hungry?

532
00:21:06,384 --> 00:21:09,019
人都有不饿的时候
People get not hungry. It happens.

533
00:21:09,054 --> 00:21:11,154
对你来说 才不是
Not to you, it doesn't.

534
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:13,457
好了 我看得出来
Okay, I can tell.

535
00:21:13,491 --> 00:21:15,525
你有事想说
There is something on your mind.

536
00:21:17,428 --> 00:21:19,629
你还在因为我跟踪你那事生气啊
Are you still pissed at me because I followed you?

537
00:21:19,664 --> 00:21:22,031
没 只是对你笔记里一些事深感好奇
No, just curious about something I read in your notes.

538
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:23,667
那些你不应该去看的笔记
Notes that you were not supposed to read.

539
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:26,336
你报导了一起有关海军承包商的事
You were doing a story on a navy contractor.

540
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,104
笔记上说你需要一些内部消息
Your notes said that you needed some inside info.

541
00:21:29,138 --> 00:21:31,474
两天后 你便邀请我去圣诞早午餐会
Two days later, you invited me to a Christmas brunch.

542
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:32,775
巧合吗? 我可不认为是
Coincidence? I don't think so.

543
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:35,511
你不想见我 你想利用我
You didn't want to see me. You wanted to use me.

544
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,613
利用我榨取内部消息
Squeeze me for some info on your guy.

545
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:39,281
你还真相信那个?
Do you really believe that?

546
00:21:39,315 --> 00:21:41,083
我想错了吗
Tell me I'm wrong.

547
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:45,286
你没想错
You're not wrong.

548
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,989
这可不好办了
That's not cool.

549
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:49,290
反正你放了我的鸽子
Well, you blew me off anyway,

550
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:50,257
这也不好办啊
and that's not cool.

551
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:51,593
我九年都没见到你了
I haven't seen you in nine years.

552
00:21:51,627 --> 00:21:52,694
从订婚结束那晚
We haven't spoken

553
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,061
我们就没有讲过话
since the night our engagement ended.

554
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:55,497
所以我俩更有理由叙旧了
All the more reason to catch up.

555
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:57,231
而你并不像叙旧
You didn't want to catch up.

556
00:21:57,265 --> 00:21:59,432
你当时在跟进一个新闻
You were after a story,

557
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:00,667
就像Howard Hawkes电影里
like some hard-boiled word-slinger

558
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:02,002
无情的雇佣文人一样
from a Howard Hawkes movie.

你以前可是个无可救药的浪漫家
You used to be a hopeless romantic.

565
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,346
而现在你就像"十一罗汉"里的
And now you're like George Clooney

566
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:14,847
"十一罗汉"里的乔治・克鲁尼
from <i>Ocean's Eleven.</i>

We'll be down in a minute.

584

别磨太久了
Don't take too long.

他的魔杖还有魔法的那些东西

So what's the problem?

620
00:24:26,438 --> 00:24:28,272
她离婚了 你是单身

621
00:24:28,306 --> 00:24:29,607
问题是 我曾经历过这一切

622

结局还不是很失败
Crash-burn.

623
00:24:30,908 --> 00:24:32,009

运输安全委员会还在寻找尸体
NTSB's still looking for bodies.

625

626
00:24:35,947 --> 00:24:38,214
问得好 麦基

628

好啊 那你想怎么样

沉默代表咱得换个话题了

外面可是很冷的
It's pretty cold out.

633
00:24:52,696 --> 00:24:54,296
我要去和她谈谈

634
00:25:02,071 --> 00:25:03,237

NCIS!
NCIS!

640
00:25:10,646 --> 00:25:12,180
逃跑是无益的 给我回来
It's no good running away. Come back here!

641
00:25:12,214 --> 00:25:13,114
麦基
McGee!

642
00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:14,649
你要去哪 嗷
You going somewhere? Ow!

643
00:25:14,684 --> 00:25:16,517
别这样啊
Come on.

644
00:25:22,857 --> 00:25:24,524
看来你没听说过NCIS啊
Guess you never heard of NCIS.

645
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,493
哥俩是警察 徽章在这啊

646
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:28,028
哦 看见了
Oh. There it is.

647
00:25:28,063 --> 00:25:29,196
听着 兄弟 我们只是...

嗷 别这样啊
Aw, come on, man.

657
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:45,712
之所以叫秘密身份是有原因的
There's a reason it's called a secret identity.

658
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:48,047
你难道才上小学三年级吗?
What are you, in the third grade?

659
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:49,048
你在干什么?
What are you do...?

660
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:50,048
真要这样
Really?

661
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:52,084
这可不是什么秘密身份
It's not a secret identity.

662
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,653
那身装扮确实很赞

嘿 那不是玩具

那是声波诱敌武器

用来混淆敌人方向感的

673
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:17,174
我们是来帮忙的
You know, we're here to help.

674
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,943
我们需要你们给点职业上的尊敬
We'd appreciate a little professional courtesy.

675
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,545
你们不是职业人员
You are not professionals.

676
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,680
嘿 头儿
Hey, boss.

00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,416
我不需要这个的
I don't need this.

678
00:26:28,385 --> 00:26:30,720
在你做出评论前 请记住哦
Before you judge, just remember,

679
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:31,788
如果事情出什么变故
if things had gone differently,

680
00:26:31,822 --> 00:26:33,923
那全是麦基的错
this could have been McGee.

681
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:35,225
疑犯在哪?
Where's the suspect?

682
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:37,127
哦 多纳盖特带他审问去了
Oh. Dorneget brought him up to interrogation.

683
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:39,962
我们将带这些人去会议室做笔录报告
We'll be debriefing these guys in the conference room.

684
00:26:39,996 --> 00:26:41,496
你肯定是管事的人了
You must be in charge.

685
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,631
我是Spandaxia
I'm Spandaxia.

686
00:26:42,665 --> 00:26:44,199
Boltcutter

688
00:26:47,771 --> 00:26:49,071

You know, laugh all you want,

694
00:26:57,746 --> 00:26:59,580
但街道是个危险之地
but the streets are a dangerous place.

695
00:26:59,614 --> 00:27:02,850
你们最多也就是在事发后做些调查
All you do is investigate after something happens.

696
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:05,486
自从我们开始巡逻 这个地区的犯罪率

需要她帮忙问一下话

她正带那记者来看
She's bringing in the reporter to see

703

能否认出昆提罗

704
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,563
姬娃和温迪单独呆在一块
Ziva's alone with Wendy?

705
00:27:17,598 --> 00:27:19,199
这可不妙啊

我不知道托尼会晕车
I did not know Tony got motion sick.

719
00:27:51,663 --> 00:27:54,232
等他没吃药的时候你就会发现的

728
00:28:10,949 --> 00:28:12,615
我得去照顾弗雷德

我确定她肯定说了什么

有什么值得告诉我的内幕?

736
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,439
哦
Oh.

737
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:46,247
哦 我看得出来 咱俩还是很像的

00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,810
为什么我要杀死
Why on Earth-616 would I kill

746

对别人很诚实
To others.

755
00:29:42,701 --> 00:29:44,936
她说你只对自己会撒谎
She said the only person you lie to is yourself.

756
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,806
而且还是经常性的
Which she says you do a lot.

757
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,273

764
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:02,786
宣传啊 知道不
Publicity, duh.

765

他们想成立自己的超级英雄团
They wanted to start their own superhero league.

766
00:30:04,823 --> 00:30:06,356
如今大家伙都有自己的团了

767
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,825
团结社区什么的

768
00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:10,292
多好的名字啊

769
00:30:10,327 --> 00:30:11,828
团结社区
Unity in the Community.

770
00:30:11,862 --> 00:30:13,563
我喜欢莱文沃思
I like Leavenworth.

771
00:30:13,597 --> 00:30:17,433
这样的 他们至今还没给我雇佣费
Look, they never paid me for the video.

772
00:30:17,468 --> 00:30:19,502
我也不知道他们真名
And I didn't know their real names,

773
00:30:19,536 --> 00:30:22,071
所以我就查了下 留下那短信
so I tracked them down, and I left that message.

774
00:30:22,105 --> 00:30:23,905
然后就去要回我的钱

775
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,107
瓦里斯和墨菲早已死了

776
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:27,742

00:30:27,777 --> 00:30:29,210
然后 你就洗劫了那地

准确地说 那钱是属于我的
Technically, the money I took was mine.

00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,983
嘿 知道我为啥自封Soulless(灵魂缺失者)
Hey, why do you think I call myself Soulless?

780
00:30:35,017 --> 00:30:37,452
但 我不是什么杀手

781
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:40,087
我留下那通语音时人还没到城里

退休中心的管理主任

786
00:30:56,274 --> 00:30:57,673
确实了昆提罗不在场的证据

00:30:57,707 --> 00:31:00,342
Soulless在星期二晚上参加了一个魔术表演
Soulless does a magic show for the residents on Tuesday nights.

788
00:31:00,377 --> 00:31:02,311
他不是我们要找的人
He's not our guy.

789
00:31:02,345 --> 00:31:03,946
我们该看看其他的超级英雄们
We should look at other superheroes.

790
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,347
呃 也许有人嫉妒

791
00:31:05,382 --> 00:31:06,782
瓦里斯所得的光彩

我不知道 头儿
Well, I don't know, boss.

794
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:10,919
我想的是其他一些天使们
I can think of a bunch of other angles.

795
00:31:12,489 --> 00:31:14,989
好吧 这档案是咱们那位记者的
Okay, the link is the reporter.

796
00:31:15,023 --> 00:31:16,291
来继续谈谈她吧
Let's keep talking about her.

几次告密者活动

799
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:20,161
和瓦里斯一起
with Wallace.

800
00:31:20,196 --> 00:31:21,796
也许他们揭发的信息有误
Well, maybe they blew the wrong whistle.

801
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,531
或者打算揭露个不一样的内幕

803
00:31:25,101 --> 00:31:26,601
给她打了电话
the day before he was killed.

804
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,136
可能是他发现了一些新的线索
Perhaps he was onto something new.

805
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,769
姬娃 再去联系下他的指挥官
Ziva, talk to his C.O. again.

他们提供了一些有关系的信息
They've provided some pertinent information.

822
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:04,836
很难相信他们有时候会这么小
Hard to believe they're so small sometimes.

823
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,571
托尼 你在想些什么
What's on your mind, Tony?

824
00:32:06,606 --> 00:32:08,306
你有点愁眉苦脸的
You sound a little pensive.

825
00:32:08,341 --> 00:32:10,142
我没有
I am not pensive!

826
00:32:10,176 --> 00:32:12,977
为什么每个人都这样说 我
What is it with everyone and that word?! I...

827
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:15,380
不好意思
Sorry.

828
00:32:15,414 --> 00:32:16,314
我只是
I'm just...

829
00:32:16,349 --> 00:32:19,049
你介不介意谈一下
Would you care to talk about it?

830
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,555
你有没有遇到过很恐怖的事 然后你觉得
You ever had something terrible happen and then you think

831
00:32:24,589 --> 00:32:27,191
你早已将其置之身后 但恐惧又再次出现
you put it all behind you, but then the terrible comes back

832
00:32:27,225 --> 00:32:29,160
并且变得比以前更加令人害怕
and it's more terrible than it was before?

833
00:32:29,194 --> 00:32:31,529
我现在很困扰
I'm confused.

834
00:32:31,563 --> 00:32:32,763
我也是
So am I.

835
00:32:32,797 --> 00:32:36,732
托尼 从认识你的第一天
Tony, it was very clear to me from the very first day

836
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:40,303
我就深知你是个情场曲折的人
that I met you that you were a man in pain.

837
00:32:40,337 --> 00:32:42,205
对不起 我觉得你把我
I'm sorry, I think you have me

838
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:43,273
跟别人弄混了
confused with someone else.

839
00:32:43,307 --> 00:32:45,975
不 在我看来 你的痛苦和杰瑟罗一样
No, your pain was as clear to me as Jethro's.

840
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:48,244
他失去了莎侬 他一生的挚爱
He lost Shannon, the one love of his life,

841
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:52,047
而你则是因纷繁复杂的原因失去了信仰
and you lost faith in yourself for so many reasons.

842
00:32:52,081 --> 00:32:54,816
杰瑟罗选择不停地和别人结婚
Jethro coped with his pain by

843
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,885
来掩埋这份痛楚
repeatedly marrying the wrong woman,

844
00:32:56,919 --> 00:32:59,788
这也造成他最终会孤身一人的结局
thus insuring that ultimately he would be alone

845
00:32:59,822 --> 00:33:01,690
并且永远心痛
and safe from heartbreak.

846
00:33:01,724 --> 00:33:05,160
你是重复地追逐错误的对象
You repeatedly chase the wrong woman.

847
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:10,031
你现在很孤独是因为 你没能做到 如你所说
You're alone because you never did, as you just said,

848
00:33:10,265 --> 00:33:12,866
将其抛之于脑后
put it all behind you.

849
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,373
当温迪在结婚前一夜
When Wendy told me the night before

850
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:21,774
告诉我取消婚礼时
we were supposed to get married that she was calling it off,

851
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:23,042
我完全不能接受
I didn't take it very well.

852
00:33:23,077 --> 00:33:26,246
我们有九年都没有说过话了
We hadn't spoken in nine years,

853
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,281
直到昨天
until yesterday.

854
00:33:28,316 --> 00:33:32,719
好了 也许命运在给你一个去完结的机会
Well, perhaps fate has given you another chance at closure.

855
00:33:32,753 --> 00:33:35,522
又或者其他
Or something else.

856
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:38,257
不是命运 是吉布斯
It's not fate, it's Gibbs.

857
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:40,092
他在整我
Dude set me up.

858
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:44,463
验尸官说了什么
What did the M.E. have to say?

859
00:33:44,497 --> 00:33:46,765
我们交流了一下
Uh, we exchanged notes on

860
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,668
这些超级英雄的生活动向
the Real-Life Superhero movement.

861
00:33:49,703 --> 00:33:51,069
结果是
It turns out,

862
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:54,472
这家伙于几个月前在临近的街区被人杀害
one was killed in the next district several months ago.

863
00:33:54,506 --> 00:33:57,108
我做了一些调查 发现另一起也是谋杀
I did some checking and found another was murdered

864
00:33:57,142 --> 00:33:58,776
而且时间还更早
sometime before that.

865
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,911
因此 这些要么是
Ergo, either these are the result

866
00:34:00,946 --> 00:34:04,849
由于高危工作造成的 或者
of a very dangerous line of work or...

867
00:34:04,883 --> 00:34:07,218
有人杀了超级英雄么
Somebody's killing Superheroes?

868
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,754
说吧
Talk to me.

869
00:34:10,788 --> 00:34:13,056
我们汇编整理了下机器谋杀案件的资料
We compiled the case data on the different murders.

870
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,191
4个受害者 三个罪案现场
Four victims, three crime scenes.

871
00:34:15,226 --> 00:34:17,461
首先 这看起来并没有可以考察的地方 亲们
At first, it looks like nothing to see here, folks.

872
00:34:17,495 --> 00:34:19,296
目击者声称前两名受害者
The witnesses said that the first two victims

873
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,930
是在值勤时被杀害的
were killed in the line of duty.

874
00:34:20,965 --> 00:34:22,299
值勤
Duty?

875
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:23,567
karma公爵
Lord of Karma

876
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:26,034
是在想阻止一起盗窃行为时被枪击
was shot trying to foil a burglary.

877
00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:28,804
Feverblister是在想要阻止劫车而被刺死
Feverblister was stabbed trying to stop a carjacking.

878
00:34:28,838 --> 00:34:30,105
很不寻常的作案手法
Very different MO's.

879
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,241
但是你提到了一种模式
But you noticed a pattern.

880
00:34:32,276 --> 00:34:34,042
你注意到了我们都注意到的东西
And you noticed that we noticed.

881
00:34:34,077 --> 00:34:37,280
这就是为什么我们有所进展
And that is why we all get along.

882
00:34:37,314 --> 00:34:40,249
现在 每次你带着手机走进一个新的地区
Now, every time you move into a new area with a cell phone,

883
00:34:40,284 --> 00:34:41,983
它都会提醒当地的移动信号塔
it pings the local cell tower.

884
00:34:42,017 --> 00:34:44,286
结果 这个相同的手机出现在
Bottom line, the same cell phone shows up

885
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,120
每一个谋杀现场的附近
in each neighborhood where a murder took place.

886
00:34:46,155 --> 00:34:48,556
这就说明 同一个人
Which means, so does the same person,

887
00:34:48,591 --> 00:34:49,791
出现在几乎相同的时间
at almost the exact same time.

888
00:34:49,825 --> 00:34:51,726
谁
Who?

889
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:53,961
我们的赢家是
Our winner is...

890
00:34:55,197 --> 00:34:57,665
克莱恩斯・托百特!
Clarence Tobett!

891
00:34:57,699 --> 00:34:59,533
别名ICU
Aka ICU.

892
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:01,101
看起来托尼是对的
Looks like Tony was right.

893
00:35:01,135 --> 00:35:03,136
头儿 我想他是在比赛中被杀死的
Boss, I think he's been killing the competition.

894
00:35:03,171 --> 00:35:04,805
我不觉得
I don't.

895
00:35:06,641 --> 00:35:09,410
你不能穿着这一身出这个房间
You are not going out of this house in that outfit!

896
00:35:09,444 --> 00:35:10,544
至少不能在大白天
Not in the day!

897
00:35:10,578 --> 00:35:11,712
欧 才怪
Yes, I am.

898
00:35:11,746 --> 00:35:15,281
只要我完成了我的招数
As soon as I finish my Mook Yan Chong kata!

899
00:35:15,316 --> 00:35:16,516
不 实际上 你没有
No, actually, you're not.

900
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,719
噢 天啊 他又犯了什么事儿
Oh, dear Lord, what did he do now?

901
00:35:19,753 --> 00:35:22,288
我们发现了一部属于凶手的手机
We found a cell phone belonging to the murderer.

902
00:35:22,323 --> 00:35:23,856
上面注册是你儿子的名字
It's registered in your son's name.

903
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,925
你们这种行为冒犯了我
I'm offended by insinuation...

904
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:26,793
住嘴
Shut up!

905
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:29,028
你再敢说一个字
Don't you say one more word.

906
00:35:29,062 --> 00:35:30,061
把我们的律师叫来
Call our lawyer.

907
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:31,396
不 我们帮你叫
No, we'll call for you.

908
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:32,397
姬娃
Ziva.

909
00:35:32,432 --> 00:35:34,700
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

910
00:35:34,734 --> 00:35:37,035
吉布斯探员 我是把很多人都送进重症监护室
Agent Gibbs, I put plenty of people in the ICU,

911
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:38,603
但我保证 他们都是罪有应得
but I assure you they all deserved...

912
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:39,604
闭上你的鸟嘴
Shut up!

913
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,440
你根本就没有送任何人进重症监护室
You didn't put anybody in the ICU.

914
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:42,541
你只是
All you do is

915
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:45,343
给医院生病的小孩送了点玩具
give toys to sick kids in hospitals.

916
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:46,577
你真的是太可悲了
You're pathetic.

917
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,716
哦哦 那是我打的
Oops, that's me.

918
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,883
肯定是拨错了电话号码
Must have dialed the wrong number.

919
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,251
你刚刚拨了什么号码
What number did you dial?

920
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,285
凶手的
The murderer's.

921
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,620
额
Ah.

922
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,389
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

923
00:35:58,423 --> 00:35:59,423
公司电话
Company phone?

924
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:02,425
你记在你儿子名下的公司
A company you keep in your son's name

925
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,526
作为避税的 对吧
for tax purposes, right?

926
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,028
给我闭嘴 汤姆
Don't you say one thing, Tom.

927
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,464
我们倒是无所谓
That's actually okay with us,

928
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,699
因为你们都有权利保持沉默
because you both have the right to remain silent.

929
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,840
ICU就免了 但是吧
Not quite the ICU, but...

930
00:36:20,777 --> 00:36:23,912
我也想试试
Works for me.

931
00:36:23,946 --> 00:36:25,581
干得好
Nice job.

932
00:36:38,494 --> 00:36:40,695
维恩・托百特是个房产大亨
<i>Wayne Tobett was a slumlord.</i>

933
00:36:40,729 --> 00:36:43,564
他喜欢在犯罪率很高的地段买下便宜的楼盘
His specialty was buying cheap buildings in crime-ridden areas.

934
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,999
犯罪率越高越好
More crime, the better.

935
00:36:45,033 --> 00:36:46,401
房产的价格就会更低
Property values were lowered.

936
00:36:46,435 --> 00:36:48,603
他最不想要的 就是在他看中的地段
The last thing he needed where he was looking to buy

937
00:36:48,637 --> 00:36:50,637
出现社区超级英雄监察团体
was a community watch program on steroids.

938
00:36:50,671 --> 00:36:53,907
但超级英雄偏巧喜欢出没在那
But that's exactly what the Real-Life Superheroes were.

939
00:36:53,941 --> 00:36:56,576
犯罪率下降了 房产价就开始上升了
Crime was down, property values were going up.

940
00:36:56,611 --> 00:36:58,044
他们真的有所作为啊
They were making a difference.

941
00:36:58,078 --> 00:36:59,880
听起来你改变看法了啊
Sounds like you've had a change of heart.

942
00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:02,181
好人就是好人 里昂
Good guys are good guys, Leon.

943
00:37:02,216 --> 00:37:03,583
是啊 坏人很坏
Yeah, bad guys are bad.

944
00:37:03,618 --> 00:37:07,352
他们肯定认识到超级英雄的效应 杀了他们
Figured they'd go in and kill the Superheroes,

945
00:37:07,387 --> 00:37:10,656
犯罪率就会上升 然后他又可以买到廉价物品了
the crime would go up, then they go in and buy cheap.

946
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,324
为什么他们想要炸死那个记者
Why'd they try to blow up the reporter?

947
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:15,327
温迪揭露了很多有关华盛顿特区房地产的内幕
Wendy had done a fluff piece on real estate in the DC area.

948
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:17,129
吉布斯探员提到过
Agent Gibbs noticed that

949
00:37:17,163 --> 00:37:19,799
很多廉价房产在那交易
the areas where a lot of cheap buying was going on

950
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:20,900
同时这地区
were the same areas

951
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:22,700
正是超级英雄们遇害之地
where Superheroes were being murdered.

952
00:37:22,735 --> 00:37:23,902
避免不了的
Of course he did.

953
00:37:23,936 --> 00:37:25,202
买家就是维恩・托百特
Buyer's Wayne Tobett.

954
00:37:25,237 --> 00:37:26,704
我们猜他越来越紧张了
We think he started getting nervous

955
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:28,473
因为温迪和我们做出同样的猜测
Wendy would make the same connection we did.

956
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:30,007
不错
Nice work.

957
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:31,543
特别是你 吉布斯探员
Especially you, Agent Gibbs.

958
00:37:31,577 --> 00:37:33,210
或者我应该说丘比特
Or should I say Cupid?

959
00:37:33,245 --> 00:37:35,112
毕竟今天是情人节
It is Valentine's Day, after all.

960
00:37:38,616 --> 00:37:41,284
头儿 他在暗示什么?
Boss, what's he talking about?

961
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,127
嗨
Hey.

962
00:37:51,162 --> 00:37:54,063
看看你
Well... look at you.

963
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:56,131
当我听说旺斯主管让你来犯罪现场采集图片
When I heard Director Vance was letting you take pictures

964
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:58,634
我不得不亲眼证实一下
of the crime scene, I had to see it to believe it.

965
00:37:58,669 --> 00:38:01,303
当他听说我要把疯狂的海军警官的故事
Well, when he heard I changed my story from crazy naval officer

966
00:38:01,338 --> 00:38:04,206
换成杀死社区英雄的房产大亨时
to evil slumlord that killed a dedicated community activist,

967
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,407
他墙裂支持啊
he got very agreeable.

968
00:38:05,442 --> 00:38:06,375
恩
Mm.

969
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,143
很喜欢你的靴子
Really like those boots.

970
00:38:08,178 --> 00:38:10,278
谢谢啊
Thank you very much.

971
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,949
我们在暗示你退下了 博思寇
That's your cue to leave, Bosco.

972
00:38:13,983 --> 00:38:15,350
谢谢
Thank you, sir.

973
00:38:15,384 --> 00:38:17,586
那个人
That guy.

974
00:38:19,254 --> 00:38:21,322
看起来 看起来
Look... Look...

975
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:25,526
那么 我 恩 那么
So, I... Hmm. So...

976
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,863
或许我们应该一个一个地说吧
Maybe we should take turns.

977
00:38:28,897 --> 00:38:31,932
女士优先
Ladies first.

978
00:38:31,967 --> 00:38:34,568
我对你说谎了 托尼
I lied to you, Tony.

979
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,403
关于啥
About?

980
00:38:36,437 --> 00:38:38,672
为什么我邀请去早午餐
Why I invited you to brunch.

981
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:42,542
你错了 我并不是想要得到那个故事的信息
You were wrong; I was not trying to get information for a story.

982
00:38:42,576 --> 00:38:45,845
我要请你是因为我想要见到你
I invited you because I wanted to see you.

983
00:38:48,482 --> 00:38:50,216
该你了
Your turn.

984
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,584
为什吗
Why?

985
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:54,854
呃 因为我们要轮流着来啊 现在该你说了
Uh, because we're taking turns, and now it's your turn.

986
00:38:54,889 --> 00:38:58,624
不对 这个不是我的本意 而且你知道的
No, that is not what I meant, and you know it.

987
00:38:58,658 --> 00:39:00,859
你想知道我为什么离开
You want to know why I left.

988
00:39:00,894 --> 00:39:03,795
我想知道的是你为啥要对我说 是的
I want to know why you said yes to me

989
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,296
可答案本应该是 不
when the answer was really no.

990
00:39:05,331 --> 00:39:07,766
我很想知道为何你一直等着
I want to know why you waited

991
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,068
直到最后才告诉我真相
until the very last minute to tell me the truth.

992
00:39:10,102 --> 00:39:14,105
但最想知道的是 我的落跑新娘为何要离开
But most of all, my runaway bride, I would like to know why.

993
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,175
好吧 为什么现在不能做出变化呢
Well, would it make a difference now?

994
00:39:17,209 --> 00:39:19,744
我的意思是 如果你不觉得很难受
I mean, if you weren't so sad

995
00:39:19,778 --> 00:39:22,780
很孤单 你根本就不会去思考
and so lonely, you wouldn't even be wondering.

996
00:39:22,814 --> 00:39:24,582
是
Are...

997
00:39:24,616 --> 00:39:25,550
悲伤和孤独
Sad and lonely?

998
00:39:25,584 --> 00:39:28,553
你是不是把我跟博思寇搞混了
You have me confused with Bosco.

999
00:39:28,587 --> 00:39:30,754
你想看看我的女友小文档吗
You like to see my little black e-book?

1000
00:39:30,788 --> 00:39:32,222
无论你给我看什么
Show me whatever you'd like,

1001
00:39:32,257 --> 00:39:35,825
那都不会改变我自己亲眼看到的真相
but it's not gonna change what I see with my own eyes.

1002
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,296
你应该告诉她你的感觉 不论她是谁
You should tell her how you feel, whoever she is.

1003
00:39:43,435 --> 00:39:45,001
A 那根本不会发生
A) That's not gonna happen.

1004
00:39:45,036 --> 00:39:46,569
B 离开我的视界
B) Get out of my head.

1005
00:39:46,603 --> 00:39:49,805
还有C 回答这个问题
And C) answer the question.

1006
00:39:51,508 --> 00:39:56,345
我离开 是因为没准备好去见他 你懂吗
I left because I wasn't ready to meet the one, okay?

1007
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,947
而你就是那个他
And you were the one.

1008
00:39:57,981 --> 00:39:59,715
这根本就说不过去
That doesn't make any sense.

1009
00:39:59,749 --> 00:40:00,783
你确定
Are you sure?

1010
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:01,884
因为在我看来
'Cause from what I see,

1011
00:40:01,918 --> 00:40:03,885
你花了过去九年半的时间
you've spent the last nine-and-a-half years

1012
00:40:03,919 --> 00:40:04,986
逃避现实的关系
avoiding real relationships.

1013
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,556
我最开始只是伤心
I was just broken first.

1014
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:11,326
这就是为什么我离开了我的英雄警察 然后跟一个
Which is why I left my hero cop and married a stockbroker

1015
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,295
只关心钱不关心人的股票经纪人结婚了
who cared more about money than people.

1016
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:18,466
我当初并未做好面对他的准备 托尼
I wasn't ready to meet the one when we met, Tony.

1017
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,302
但我送去邀请是因为...
But I sent you that invitation because...

1018
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,036
我现在准备好了
I am now.
