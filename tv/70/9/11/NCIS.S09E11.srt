平安夜--旅店客满
Christmas Eve - no room at the inn.

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,710
谁能想到呢 对吧?
Who would have guessed,right?

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:19,640
你确定?
Are you sure?

也许有客人取消预订

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,980
看样子只剩下高级套房 节假日价格
Looks like the only thing we have available is our Premiere Suite at the holiday rate.

12
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,090
我要了
I'll take it.

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,730
您不打算先问价格?
Don't you want to know how much first?

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,270
不用
No.

15
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,940

我下楼去接你

18
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,220
<font color=#B1D20E>海军罪案调查处 第09季 第11集 </font>
 

19
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,850

Yes,it is,Tony.

21
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,640
我们运气太背
And we drew the short straw.

22
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,580
还要来值班 你们干嘛咧着嘴笑?
We have to work.So why are you smiling?

23
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,170
你没告诉我们Wendy给你寄圣诞贺卡了
You did not tell us that Wendy sent you a Christmas card.

24
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,330
哪个Wendy?

25
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,340

你前任未婚妻Wendy

27
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,610
噢 那个啊 你们干嘛看我的圣诞贺卡?
Oh,yeah,that.What are you doing reading my Christmas cards?

28
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,440
卡片钉在你桌后的墙上
It was pinned on the wall behind your desk.

29
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,390
挂墙上不就是为了跟别人分享么
People usually do that so that others can enjoy them.

30
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,410
我还以为你和Wendy有些年头没...
I thought you and Wendy haven't talked in...

31
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,420
9年
Nine years.

32
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,500
你们想说什么?
What's your point?

33
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,000
上面说她和前夫去年离婚了
So it says here that she and her ex-husband divorced last year.

34
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
我看了 真替她难过
I read that.Too bad.Very sad.

35
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:36,520
她还邀请你明天共进圣诞早午餐 和她 以及她7岁的儿子 Fred
And she invited you to Christmas brunch tomorrow with her and her seven-year-old son,Fred.

36
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,930
真可爱
Pretty cute.

37
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,990
你去吗?
So you going to go?

38
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:45,690
不去 我已经把那段日子归于浮云
No. I think I'll relegate that part of my life to Christmas past.

39
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,470
我感觉Wendy是想和你重温旧梦
Well,I get the impression that Wendy may be looking to try again with you.

40
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,300
你这么认为?
You think so?

41
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,050
不 不 不 当然不是了
No,no,no,of course not.

42
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,250
我怎么会有放他鸽子的想法呢 Breena
I wouldn't dream of blowing him off,Breena.

43
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,350
我等不及和你爸共度美好时光
I can't wait to hang out with your dad.

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,620

Yeah.

45
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,320
好的 我迟点再打给你
Okay,I-I'll call you later.

46
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,880
小Jim同学 这件可爱马甲怎么来的啊?
Tiny Jim,to what do we owe this lovely sweater vest?

47
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,710
谢谢你留意到了 Tony
Thank you,Tony,for noticing.

48
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,180
是Breena送我的礼物
It was a gift from Breena.

49
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,040
实际上 不幸的是 我送她的礼物随时会到
Actually,unfortunately,my gift to her should be arriving at any minute.

50
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:21,250
我答应他爸来城里度假的时候 带他来NCIS一游
I agreed to give her father a tour of NCIS,while he's in town for the holidays.

51
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,830
哟 很好么
Well,that is nice.

52
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,430
但我觉得Vance主任会否决这提议
Actually,I thought Director Vance would nix the idea.

53
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,420
你和Breena老爸相处不愉快?
You and Breena's dad do not get along?

54
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,940
上次Ed和我谈话 是我请求他把Breena嫁给我
The last time that Ed and I talked was when I asked for his permission to marry Breena.

55
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,350
他笑了
He laughed.

56
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:40,650
他笑得太厉害 接着又哭了
And then he cried from laughing so hard.

57
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:44,120
然后突然鸦雀无声
Then he got really quiet.

58
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,780
他来这里干嘛?
So why is he coming here?

59
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,760
Breena希望我们在婚礼前 能建立起良好的关系
Breena wanted us to bond before the wedding.

60
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,050
她觉得他最在意我的工作

61
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,130
验尸精灵
Autopsy gremlin.

62
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,010
不是吧 等着他进来撞见我们在谈这个?
Yeah,if we could keep that kind of talk to a minimum while he's here?

63
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,560
我已经用上最美妙的词汇了
I say it with the utmost respect.

64
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,570
我明白 我懂 但是Ed不明白
I know that,I know that,but Ed doesn't.

65
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,090
他觉得我困在了一份工资又低
You guys,he actually thinks that I'm stuck in some government job

66
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,720
工作时间又长的政府工作
which pays too little and requires too many hours.

67
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,310
事实如此 把屁股从我桌上挪开
You are. Get off my desk.

68

我得打电话给Ed取消约会
So I'd better call Ed and cancel.

71
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,730
等等 你哪儿都不用去 Palmer

81
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,700
血溅痕迹表明他中枪时站在这里

The gunmen must have used silencers and no fingerprints or evidence were left behind.

87
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,380
职业杀手 - 行家

代客泊车要25元

嘿 看样子死者是海军

Either our dead Navy captain was having an identity crisis,or he wasn't traveling alone.

104
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,450

00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,930
没事 继续
Go ahead.

138
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,480
好吧 Ed?
Okay.Ed?

139
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,730
这位...
This...

140
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:42,250
呃 Slater先生 这位是我们的英雄领袖 特别探员Leroy Jethro Gibbs
uh,Mr.Slater,this is our fearless leader,Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

141
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,400
还有我们的特别探员 Anthony Tony DiNozzo
Over here we have Special Agent Anthony "Tony" DiNozzo.

142
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,920
别说了 James 我又不是来查户口的
Stop speaking,James.I don't need their dossiers.

143
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,200
在这里待几个小时就走
Only here for a few hours.

144
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,090
但很高兴认识你们
But what a pleasure.

145
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,690
欢迎来到NCIS Slater先生
Welcome to NCIS,Mr.Slater.

146
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,750
真不知道怎么夸你的未来女婿 和他的尽忠职守
Can't say enough about your future son-in-law and his work ethic here.

147
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,580
所以我才过来 对吧?
Yes,well,that's why I'm here,isn't it?

148
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,450
来看看 如果我女儿嫁给James 是只嫁给了他
To make sure that if my daughter marries James,she gets him,

149
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,820
而不是在衙门里工作的 带着官僚作风的爷们 懂不?
not the bureaucratic baggage that comes with a government job,you know?

150
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,370
不懂 - 不懂?
- No. - No?

151
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,680
是不懂
No.

152
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,890
不好意思 你刚才是不是说 "如果她嫁给他"
I'm sorry,did you just say "if she marries him"?

153
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,600
你就想着吧 我来问你 特别超级探员 Gibbs
Big if.Let me ask you something,Special Super Agent Gibbs.

154
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,570
你是唯一让员工在平安夜加班的领导吗
Are you the only team leader who makes his folks work Christmas Eve?

155
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,480
山姆大叔让你往东 你不敢往西 君让臣死 臣非死不可
I guess when Uncle Sam calls you answer,even when he calls collect.

156
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,750
我觉着我们应该全面参观一下这地方
I think we've seen all we should in the squad room.

157
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,220
不如我带你...
Why don't I show you...

158
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,080
看看其他地方?
anyplace else?

159
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,670
非常抱歉
I'm so sorry.

160
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,580
真是个有礼貌的人
He's a pleasant man.

161
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,500
McGee 打进酒店的电话
McGee,phone call to the hotel.

162
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,540
追踪了号码
Traced the number.

163
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:44,960
电话来自于马里兰 菲尔莫 从奥特莱斯商场的公用电话打出
The call came from a courtesy phone at an outlet mall in Fillmore,Maryland.

164
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,320
距这儿两小时车程
That's two hours from here.

165
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,700
如果神秘女人在酒店出现 为什么又去那里?
If our mystery woman was at the hotel,how did she get out there?

166
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,480
找到她 弄清楚
Find her. Find out.

167
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,590
现在调出商场的监控录像
Pulling mall security footage now.

168
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,100
本来是要参观国家圣诞树 结果在肯尼迪中心碰上胡桃夹子
<i>A visit to the national Christmas tree followed by a production of The Nutcracker at the Kennedy Center.</i>

169
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:03,620
真悲催 上校 你的华盛顿之旅实在是
Sadly,Captain,your visit to D.C.was,

170
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,290
太过简要而不能领略我们城市的假日风采
well,much too brief to enjoy our city's holiday fare.

171
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,830
他经常自言自语?
He always talk to himself?

172
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,990
实际上 Slater先生 我是在与死者交流
Actually,Mr.Slater,I am conversing with our victim.

173
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,910
呃 真是浪费时间
Well,it's a waste of time.

174
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,800
我认为 死了就是死了
In my experience,the dead are dead.

175
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,480
你这话是什么意思?
And what experience would that be?

176
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,870
Ed经营一间殡仪馆
Ed owns a funeral home.

177
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,530
我猜这就是Breena热衷于防腐的原因吧?
I guess that is where Breena got her passion for embalming,huh?

178
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,360
我以前经常跟她说...
I always used to tell her...

179
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,940
你又话多了 James
You're speaking again,James.

180
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:31,090
我是个职业殡葬承办人 Mallard医生
Uh,I'm a professional mortician,Dr.Mallard.

181
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,920
那你应该知道每个人都有 自己的故事要讲 只要你问对了问题
Then you should know that everybody has a unique story to tell if asked the right questions.

182
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,960
也许吧 不过你这么滔滔不绝的 这可怜的家伙也插不上嘴 是吧?
Maybe,but,uh,as much as you talk,this poor guy can hardly get a word in edgewise.Huh?

183
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,410
我看你俩最好在外面等
I think it best if you two wait outside.

184
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,430
是啊 我可以等
Yeah,I'll second that.

185
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,650
为啥... - 批准动议
- Look,why... - Motion carries.

186
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,050
还有很多东西要看
Lot of things to see.

187
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,710
很有意思 是吧?
This is fun,huh?

188
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:56,750
Duck 有什么线索?
Duck,what do you got?

189
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,850
确认了死因
Confirmation of cause of death.

190
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,550
还有这个 当我脱下上校的衣服 发现这个在裤子口袋里面
And this - when I took off the captain's clothes I found it stuffed deep in a pants pocket.

191
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,010
干的血迹 他的?
Dried blood.His?

192
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,290
得让Abby检测
That's up to Abby.

193
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,580
但除了子弹伤口很新鲜以外
But apart from the bullet wounds which are fresh,

194
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,710
在其他地方也没发现有外伤痕迹
there's no other exterior signs of trauma anywhere.

195
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,760
血迹也可能来自于失踪女人
Blood could be from our missing woman.

196
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:20,030
如果是的话 就说明她不仅在逃命
Well,if it were,it would suggest that in addition to being on the run,

197
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,320
可能也受伤了
she could also be wounded.

198
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,740
Abbs
Abbs.

199
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,750
- Gibbs 来实验室? - 好 马上来
- Gibbs,coming to the lab? - Yeah,I'm on my way.

200
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,800
Abbs?
Abbs?

201
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,140
Abby?
Abby?

202
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,760
在这后面
Back here.

203
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,910
谢天谢地 只有你
Oh,thank goodness it's just you.

204
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:49,500
Jimmy和他那二逼岳父窜来窜去 到处散布些傻逼言论和圣诞衰话
Jimmy and his Grinch-in-law have been stalking the halls spreading ill-will and yuletide yuckness.

205
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,010
他在大厅时是不是要和你吵架?
Hey,did he try to pick a fight with you in the squad room?

206
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,100
没有 他只是一个...
No,he's just being a...

207
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,160
不合时宜 不可理喻地粗俗之人
Unseasonably and unreasonably rude.

208
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,980
他马上就当岳父了
He's being a father-in-law to be.

209
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,820
如果他明白事理的话
Well,if he knows what's good for him,

210
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,300
他就应该远离我的地盘 至少20尺之外再唱祝酒词
he's not going to come a-wassailing within at least 20 feet of my leaves of green.

211
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,730
发现什么?
What do we got?

212
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:12,490
McGee发来的商场监控录像 还有卡罗尔镇专营商场里的好人们
Mall security footage courtesy of McGee and the kind people at the Carroll County Outlet Shoppes.

213
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,230
那简直是卡罗尔之宝
"The Jewel of Carroll County."

214
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,970
我觉得在卡罗尔也没啥可做的...
I don't think there's a lot to do in Carroll County...

215
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,490
找到打电话的女人了吗?
Did you find our female caller?

216
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,290
我实现你第一个圣诞许愿 Gibbs
I'm granting you your first Christmas wish,Gibbs.

217
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,910
那就是她 给酒店打电话
That is her,calling the hotel.

218
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,620
如果Ducky发现的那块血迹是她的 不过她看上去不象受伤的样子
If the blood on the rag that Ducky found is hers,she doesn't appear wounded.

219
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,240
查到身份吗?
Get an I.D.?

220
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,030
没有 不过我知道她在哪
No,but I think I know where she is.

221
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,480
看她转向摄像头
Watch when she turns towards the camera.

222
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:43,340
假使如你所说 你会有办法查清楚
"If you are who you say,you will figure it out."

223
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,030
购物袋? - 没错
- The bag? - Yeah.

224
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,460
是一间女式服装店的
It's from a women's clothing store.

225
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,970
她知道我们会看监控
She knew that we would watch the security footage.

226
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,150
她想让你去找到她 Gibbs
She wants you to come find her,Gibbs.

227
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,540
干得漂亮

228
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,870
让DiNozzo与当地警方联系 和我们在那里汇合
Tell DiNozzo to have local P.D. meet us there.

229

Welcome to Carroll County. You must be NCIS.

230
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,120
外面确实下雪了 是吧?

所以他们派了个商场保安?

能告诉我们最新情况吗 副警长?
You got an update,Deputy?

236
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,680
是的 长官
Yes,sir.

237
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,130
我仔细检查了商场 还没发现情绪不正常的人
I canvassed the store,but haven't found anyone in distress.

238
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,210
你们找的人肯定已经离开了
Whoever you're looking for must have left already.

239
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,360
你看得有多仔细?
How hard did you look?

240
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,000
我跟每一个单独逛街的人都聊过
I talked to every single solitary person.

241
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,740
那更衣室的呢?
What about in the dressing rooms?

242
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,870

253
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,540
假证件我不是没见过

254
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,590
交出你的武器
Hand over your weapons.

255
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,270
只有一个办法能让海军交枪
There's only one way to get a Marine's weapon.

256
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,210
对此你了解多少?

257
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,200
你是海军陆战队员?
You a leatherneck?

258
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,540
不然你以为我在哪儿剪的这发型?
Where do you think I got this haircut?

259
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,530
如果杀Jake的凶手不是你俩 那就意味着他们还在外虎视耽耽
Well,if you two aren't the ones that killed Jake,that means that they're still out there.

260
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,820
你觉得他们也在追杀你?
You think they're after you,too?

261
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,790
我知道他们是谁
I know they are.

262
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,260
Jake不是目标 我才是
Jake wasn't the target - I am.

263
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:15,828
我是在青年营获得的ITS(单兵训练标准)
Did my I.T.S. at Camp Lejeune.

264
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,838

Weather's getting pretty bad,boss.

269
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:26,888
拖车堵在高速上 一辆接一辆的
Tractor trailer jackknifed on the highway.It's bumper to bumper.

270
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,708
你出去买咖啡了 DiNozzo?
You out getting coffee,DiNozzo?

271
00:14:28,788 --> 00:14:30,838
不 不 这是给孕妇准备的热可可...
No,no,no,this is hot chocolate for the preg...

272
00:14:30,898 --> 00:14:31,908
给上尉
the Lieutenant.

273
00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:35,098
大家听着 我不需要特殊对待
Listen,everyone,I don't want any special treatment.

274
00:14:35,318 --> 00:14:37,798
我首先是个陆战队员 其次才是孕妇
I'm a Marine first and pregnant second.

275
00:14:37,948 --> 00:14:39,498
噢...哇
Oo-rah.

276
00:14:39,558 --> 00:14:41,088
噢是的
Oo-right.

277
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:42,848
我很高兴接受特殊待遇
Well,I will gladly take the special treatment.

278
00:14:42,938 --> 00:14:46,368
我想要杯加点棉花糖的 小块点的
I like mine with extra marshmallows-- the little tiny ones,please.

279
00:14:46,438 --> 00:14:48,228
你当我是谁 你的家养小精灵?
Who do you think I am,your elf?

280
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,798
其实我也想要一杯加棉花糖的
Actually,I'll take one with marshmallows,too.

281
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:54,428
鉴于你说你不想被特别对待...
Thought you said you didn't want any special...

282
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,968
加棉花糖的马上就来
Extra marshmallows coming up.

283
00:14:57,818 --> 00:14:59,918
谁在追杀你 上尉?
So who is after you,Lieutenant?

284
00:14:59,988 --> 00:15:01,138
不知道
I don't know.

285
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:04,628
我八个半月前才回国
Only ever been a squared-away Marine until eight and a half months ago.

286
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:06,708
以前我一直驻扎在喀布尔城外
I was stationed outside Kabul.

287
00:15:06,788 --> 00:15:09,588
我们小组负责训练阿富汗当地士兵
Our unit was training local Afghan soldiers.

288
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:12,188
其中一个会讲英语
One of them spoke English.

289
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:14,258
他叫Amir
His name was Amir.

290
00:15:14,828 --> 00:15:16,148
事情变得浪漫了
Things got romantic.

291
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:19,838
起码在那种鬼地方不会觉得浪漫
At least what passes for romantic in that hellhole.

292
00:15:19,908 --> 00:15:22,578
在条件差的地方是需要勇气的
Sand can get in some pretty inconvenient places.

293
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:24,428
被纪律处分了?
Any disciplinary action?

294
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:25,848
我负全责
I took responsibility.

295
00:15:25,888 --> 00:15:29,828
我被扣两个月工资 遣送回本土
C.O. made me forfeit two months pay and sent me stateside.

296
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:31,298
以为事情就此打住
Thought that was it.

297
00:15:31,378 --> 00:15:32,808
但是?
But?

298
00:15:33,788 --> 00:15:38,048
上周 我注意到被一辆黑色SUV跟踪
Last week,I noticed I was being followed by a black SUV.

299
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,958
我摆脱了它 然后另一辆车又出现了
I would shake it,and then another one would show up.

300
00:15:40,008 --> 00:15:41,468
有多个人在跟踪你?
Multiple people were following you?

301
00:15:41,518 --> 00:15:43,688
三个人 分别有越野车
Three men - separate SUV's.

302
00:15:43,748 --> 00:15:45,598
我记下了其中一辆的车牌号
I got one of the license numbers.

303
00:15:45,638 --> 00:15:48,168
登记在国防部的名下
It was registered to the Department of Defense.

304
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:51,128
给McGee打电话 让他跟踪调查
Call McGee.Have him follow up.

305
00:15:55,048 --> 00:15:57,898
所以你跟Marsden一起逃出城来?
So you skipped town with Marsden?

306
00:15:57,968 --> 00:15:59,668
Jake是我的老朋友
Jake's an old friend.

307
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,458
他建议开车送我去我父母 在俄亥俄州的家里
He offered to drive me to my parents' place in Ohio.

308
00:16:03,138 --> 00:16:04,938
从那时候事情变得疯狂了
That's when things got crazy.

309
00:16:05,018 --> 00:16:06,468
他们跟踪了你
They followed you.

310
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:08,068
他们试图把我们挤下公路
They tried to run us off the road.

311
00:16:08,128 --> 00:16:09,948
玻璃破的时候我割伤了手
I cut my hand when the window broke.

312
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:13,598
然后我们甩掉了他们 但是我开始感觉头晕 于是我们去了旅馆
And we lost them.But I started feeling woozy,so we went to the hotel.

313
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:17,188
当Jake没有下来的时候 我就知道我必须要从那儿逃出来
When Jake didn't come down,I knew that I had to get out of there.

314
00:16:17,438 --> 00:16:19,368
你为什么不给警察打电话呢?
Why didn't you call the police?

315
00:16:20,128 --> 00:16:24,268
如果这些家伙是政府的人 他们也会派当地执法部门来找我们的
If these guys were government,they would send local LEOs looking for us,too.

316
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:27,368
我不知道这是为什么 还要持续多久
I don't know what this is about or how far up this goes.

317
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:30,388
你可以相信我们
Well,you can trust us.

318
00:16:33,088 --> 00:16:34,428
谢谢
Thank you.

319
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:37,718
孩子的父亲现在在哪儿?
Where's the father now?

320
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:40,948
- 孩子的父亲去世了? - 是的
<i>- The baby's father's dead? - Yes.</i>

321
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:44,538
Amir Mayat五月份 死于路边炸弹爆炸
Amir Mayat died in an IED explosion back in May.

322
00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:48,978
报告称 Reynolds上尉 在事故以后就去休假了
Says here,Lieutenant Reynolds went on leave after the incident.

323
00:16:49,378 --> 00:16:50,808
那她的公公婆婆呢?
What about the in-laws?

324
00:16:50,858 --> 00:16:52,748
他们应该对关心一下孩子吧
I mean,they must have some interest in the child.

325
00:16:52,868 --> 00:16:57,428
根据她的说法 怀孕的事情她和Amir是瞒着他的家人的
According to her statement,she and Amir kept the pregnancy a secret from his family.

326
00:16:57,508 --> 00:17:00,058
你看 McGee探员 所有这些都在她的档案里面
You know,Agent McGee,all of this is in her personnel file.

327
00:17:00,108 --> 00:17:02,168
你不需要我念给你听的
You don't need me to read it to you.

328
00:17:02,218 --> 00:17:03,478
不要挂
Hang on.

329
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,408
你到底想要知道什么?
What is it you really want to know?

330
00:17:10,978 --> 00:17:14,678
这份档案是国防部唯一一份关于 Reynolds上尉的文件吗?
Is that file the only record DOD has on Lieutenant Reynolds?

331
00:17:14,728 --> 00:17:15,578
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

332
00:17:15,678 --> 00:17:17,048
有人跟踪了她
Someone's having her followed.

333
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:18,508
你认为是我们?
You think it's us?

334
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,478
我们是国防部 又不是中情局
We're DOD,not CIA.

335
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:22,738
我们一般不会做这种事情
We don't usually do that kind of thing.

336
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:23,678
一般
Usually.

337
00:17:23,728 --> 00:17:26,348
我们干吗要关心Reynolds 在她产假的时候做什么呢?
Why would we care what Reynolds does on her maternity leave?

338
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,528
我们有理由相信三名持枪人员 利用注册在国防部名下的车辆
We have reason to believe that three gunmen using vehicles registered

339
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:33,898
杀死了一名海军上校 而且现在在跟踪Reynolds上尉
to the DOD murdered a Navy captain and are now after the Lieutenant.

340
00:17:34,378 --> 00:17:35,678
你想说什么?
What are you suggesting?

341
00:17:35,748 --> 00:17:38,378
你知道我们在这个城里 注册了多少辆车吗?
Do you know how many vehicles we have registered in this city?

342
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:40,248
几千辆 而且常常被偷
Thousands.They get stolen all the time.

343
00:17:40,338 --> 00:17:43,168
我很乐意为你查一下我们的数据库
I'd be happy to check our database for you.

344
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:45,818
我明白 先生 但是你还是没有回答我的问题
I understand that,sir,but you're not answering my question.

345
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,938
Reynolds上尉是不是在你的监视之下?
Is Lieutenant Reynolds on your radar?

346
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:51,688
McGee探员 现在唯一在我的监视之下 的就是圣诞老人了
Agent McGee,the only thing on my radar right now is Santa Claus.

347
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:53,468
我明白了 先生
I understand,sir.

348
00:17:53,528 --> 00:17:56,988
但是如果你有任何 关于Reynolds中尉的消息 请告知我们
But you will let us know if you find out anything on Lieutenant Reynolds?

349
00:17:58,048 --> 00:18:01,208
即便是我有消息 在没有授权的情况下我也不能告诉你
Even if I did,I couldn't tell you without authorization.

350
00:18:01,358 --> 00:18:04,738
圣诞快乐
<i>Feliz Navidad.</i>

351
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:08,718
是 Abbs
Yeah,Abbs.

352
00:18:08,758 --> 00:18:10,458
Gibbs 你还在那边干什么?
Gibbs,what are you still doing there?

353
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:13,318
雪坠落得比我的圣诞情绪还要快
The snow is falling faster than my holiday spirit.

354
00:18:13,368 --> 00:18:16,168
一名怀孕的陆战队员在圣诞节被追捕
There's a pregnant Marine being hunted on Christmas.

355
00:18:16,238 --> 00:18:17,778
天堂和大自然都不唱歌了
Heaven and nature are not singing.

356
00:18:17,828 --> 00:18:20,948
我在等消息 还有州警察派来的一个护卫队 就告诉我你有什么发现
Well,I'm waiting on intel and an escort from state troopers.Just tell me what you got.

357
00:18:21,008 --> 00:18:23,488
Reynolds上尉孩子的父亲 -Amir Mayat-的背景
Background on Lieutenant Reynolds' baby daddy--

358
00:18:23,538 --> 00:18:26,528
他可不是个贫穷的农民
Amir Mayat - and he is not a poor farmer.

359
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:31,358
Mayat的部落控制着喀布尔城外 一大片重要的土地
The Mayat tribe controls a massive and critical land parcel just outside of Kabul.

360
00:18:31,418 --> 00:18:32,288
家族资产
Family's wealthy.

361
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:33,178
非常大
Extremely.

362
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,318
而且Amir是唯一的男性继承人
And Amir was the sole male heir.

363
00:18:35,338 --> 00:18:36,588
直到他被杀死
Until he was killed.

364
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:39,898
对 如果Emma有了个男孩 那么...
Yes. And if Emma has a boy,then...

365
00:18:39,948 --> 00:18:40,938
这个孩子就继承了一切
The kid inherits everything.

366
00:18:41,008 --> 00:18:42,208
甚至是王位
Practically royalty.

367
00:18:42,268 --> 00:18:44,168
最少也是极度的财富
At least extremely valuable.

368
00:18:44,198 --> 00:18:46,158
这也就解释了为什么中尉 到现在还活着
Well,that explains why the Lieutenant's still alive.

369
00:18:46,248 --> 00:18:47,968
哦 对 对 对 他们不想让她死
Oh,yeah,yeah.They don't want her dead.

370
00:18:48,008 --> 00:18:49,528
他们需要这孩子活着
They want the baby alive.

371
00:18:49,598 --> 00:18:51,668
这解释不了为什么国防部会参与进来
It does not explain DOD's involvement.

372
00:18:51,738 --> 00:18:52,948
这有可能 老大
This might,boss.

373
00:18:53,028 --> 00:18:54,198
什么 McGee?
What,McGee?

374
00:18:54,628 --> 00:18:55,518
我做了些深入的挖掘
I did some digging.

375
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:57,538
穿过了国防部的防火墙
I tunneled under the DOD firewall.

376
00:18:57,598 --> 00:19:03,668
发现美国在阿富汗的军事力量正试图 建造一条通过Mayat家土地的贸易公路
Turns out U.S. military forces in Afghanistan are trying to build a trade highway through Mayat land.

377
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:07,058
这对镇压武装分子和 阻止武器走私非常重要
It's vital for fighting insurgents and stopping weapons shipments.

378
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,608
但是部落的长老们并不合作
And the tribal elders aren't cooperating.

379
00:19:09,688 --> 00:19:12,398
需要国防部花费数百万美元
Which is costing the DOD millions of dollars.

380
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:14,618
但是如果项目失败 他们可能失去的更多
And if the project goes under,they lose even more.

381
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:16,348
他们需要谈判筹码
Well,they need a bargaining chip.

382
00:19:16,408 --> 00:19:17,768
这个小婴儿继承人
The little baby heir.

383
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:20,068
根据长子继承权 他会成为Mayat部落的头领
By birthright,he'll be the head of the Mayat tribe.

384
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,868
他们得到了孩子 就得到了土地
They have the kid,they have the land.

385
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:22,698
我们能证实吗?
Can we prove it?

386
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:27,388
我还没找到任何实际的证据 将国防部和我们的三名杀手联系起来
Well,I still can't find anything concrete connecting the DOD and our three kings.

387
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:28,538
继续找
Keep looking.

388
00:19:41,778 --> 00:19:43,818
他们关在里面给有多久了?
How long have they been back there?

389
00:19:45,078 --> 00:19:46,808
还不够久
Not long enough.

390
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:48,928
开门
Door.

391
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:50,678
我听不到他们在说什么
I can't hear a word they're saying.

392
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:55,008
如果你不对她的纹身做那样的评价 我们也不会在这儿耗时间
Well,if you hadn't made that remark about her tattoos,we wouldn't be in time out.

393
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:57,918
我还有六分钟的下班
I still got six minutes left.

394
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:03,948
你应该知道在私营企业工作你能挣到
You do know that there are jobs in the private sector where

395
00:20:04,018 --> 00:20:08,158
比这多两倍的工资 而且同样可以六点钟到家 对吧?
you could make twice as much money and still be home by 6:00,right?

396
00:20:08,998 --> 00:20:10,798
没怎么考虑过
Hadn't really thought about that.

397
00:20:11,198 --> 00:20:13,638
你可以开始考虑一下
Well,maybe you should start.

398
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:20,958
而且我只是跟她说 有纹身的女孩比较放荡
And all I said to her was that girls with tattoos are easy.

399
00:20:21,028 --> 00:20:22,578
每个人都知道的
Everyone knows that.

400
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,188
出什么问题了吗 Gibbs探员? 你发现什么了?
Is something wrong,Agent Gibbs?What did you find out?

意思是我们要赶紧离开这儿

就是有点受打击吧 我想
Just a bit overwhelmed,I guess.

449

469
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:48,613

你们怎么还没走?
You guys are still here,huh?

484
00:25:13,283 --> 00:25:16,803
呃 我是Ed的车夫 严格来说 我还没完成工作 所以...
Well,I'm Ed's ride,and technically I'm still on duty,so...

Let me guess - a trained mercenary who's used to hard Russian winters and even harder Russian prisons?

Pretty much.

501
00:25:53,253 --> 00:25:54,813
你打算怎么让他开口?
How do you want to break him?

502

怎么了?我饿了

我可没料到会当了人质
Didn't know I'd be held hostage.

505
00:26:10,363 --> 00:26:11,903
等一下
Wait a second.

506

电脑还是不能用 不过我在试
The phones are still out,but I'll keep checking.

This is not exactly the Christmas Eve that I had planned on,Agent Gibbs.

我不知道 可是我有感觉
I don't,but I can tell.

535
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,863
根据他现在踢打我的力道来看...
Oh,and judging by the way he's punching and kicking me right now...

536
00:27:45,913 --> 00:27:48,173

我猜其他人肯定不止这个想法
I guess someone else had other plans.

540
00:28:01,173 --> 00:28:03,743
是啊 不是第一次了
Yeah.Wouldn't be the first time.

541
00:28:05,773 --> 00:28:07,563
你有孩子吗 Gibbs先生?
Do you have kids,Agent Gibbs?

542
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:09,703
曾经有个女儿
Had a daughter.

543
00:28:10,503 --> 00:28:12,243
她出生时候你在吗?
Were you there when she was born?

544
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:14,413
外派
Deployed.

545
00:28:17,353 --> 00:28:19,673
我觉得也得就靠我一人了
Well,I guess I kind of have to be there for mine.

546
00:28:20,123 --> 00:28:21,373
我不是在抱怨
Not that I'm complaining.

547
00:28:21,453 --> 00:28:22,823
只是...
It's just...

548
00:28:22,893 --> 00:28:24,483
我或许会...
I might be...

549
00:28:24,753 --> 00:28:26,423
害怕?
Scared?

550
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:28,643
你在说啥?
The hell you say?

551
00:28:28,713 --> 00:28:30,123
即便害怕也没事
It's all right if you are.

552
00:28:30,193 --> 00:28:32,053
这可跟军人法条不一致
Not according to the Corps.

553
00:28:32,123 --> 00:28:34,613
也就是为什么我喜欢当海军的原因
That's what I like about being a Marine.

554
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,763
程序

The code.

556
00:28:37,003 --> 00:28:40,233
我喜欢能触及到的期望
I like having a measurable set of expectations.

557
00:28:40,293 --> 00:28:43,153
我可以很骄傲地说自己做得有多好 但是怀着孩子...
I could always tell how good I was doing,but with this...

558
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:46,803
我怎么知道?
how do I know?

559
00:28:46,973 --> 00:28:49,603
你不知道
You don't.

560
00:28:49,863 --> 00:28:51,993
可是你能感觉到
But you'll be able to tell.

561
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:58,533
我觉得这小子告诉我现在该吃饭了
Right now,I think this guy is telling me that it's time to eat.

562
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:02,593
好...这样的话...
Well... in that case...

563
00:29:06,383 --> 00:29:07,683
算我请的
This one's on me.

564
00:29:12,223 --> 00:29:13,543
谢谢
Thank you.

565
00:29:19,153 --> 00:29:22,693

下面我们要进行是或不是的问答 好让我们了解你的基准线
I'm going to start with a series of true or false statements to give us a baseline.

567
00:29:28,713 --> 00:29:30,163
你们在说什么?
What are you talking about?

568
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:33,273
就把这个想象成有饼干吃的测谎试验
Just think of it as like a lie detector test with cookies.

569
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:35,393
你只需要坐在这儿吃就行了
You just have to sit there and eat.

570
00:29:36,713 --> 00:29:38,033
好了 我们开始
Okay,here we go.

你的手指都在

573
00:29:51,193 --> 00:29:55,133
你尾随Emma Reynolds中尉 企图绑架她的孩子
You were following Lieutenant Emma Reynolds with the intention of abducting her baby.

574
00:29:58,393 --> 00:29:59,633
哦 犹豫
Oh,hesitation.

575
00:29:59,723 --> 00:30:00,683
我看到了犹豫
I see the hesitation.

576
00:30:00,753 --> 00:30:01,953
是啊 他犹豫了 - 没错
- Yeah,He did. - Yeah.

577
00:30:02,003 --> 00:30:03,563
确认了 犹豫
Confirming hesitation.

578
00:30:03,603 --> 00:30:05,563
没有 我可没犹豫
No,no,I did not hesitate.

579
00:30:05,613 --> 00:30:07,023
我不知道你该说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

580
00:30:07,103 --> 00:30:08,753
你确定?
You sure about that?

581
00:30:11,963 --> 00:30:14,113
你从没有犯罪
You've never committed a crime.

582
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,913
你最喜欢的颜色是粉色
Your favorite color is pink.

583
00:30:19,253 --> 00:30:22,873
你受雇于美国国防部的某人
You were hired by someone at the United States Department of Defense.

584
00:30:29,813 --> 00:30:32,203
所以你实际上是为政府效力!
So you really are working for the government!

585
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:35,143
不 我不知道你在说什么
No. I don't know what you're talking about.

586
00:30:35,213 --> 00:30:36,793
你确定?
Sure about that?

587
00:30:36,883 --> 00:30:40,233
那你就是为阿富汗的Mayat部落效力
So then you must be working for the Mayat tribe in Afghanistan.

588
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:47,153
我觉得这是代表咱们说对了
I'll take that as a yes.

589
00:30:47,223 --> 00:30:49,813
不是 我只是被饼干噎到
No. I just choke on cookie.

590
00:30:49,873 --> 00:30:51,423
这不能说明什么
It does not mean anything.

591
00:30:51,493 --> 00:30:53,453
哦 这很能说明问题
Oh,it speaks volumes.

592
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:55,843
太愚蠢了!
This is stupid!

593
00:30:55,903 --> 00:30:57,873
你们只是在努力搅乱我的思维!
You're just trying to mess with my head!

594
00:30:57,933 --> 00:31:01,413
如果不是真的 那你为什么又如此沮丧?
Then why are you getting so upset if it isn't true?

595
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:06,113
如果是家族雇佣了你 他们肯定查到了那个孩子
If the family hired you,then they must have found out about the baby.

596
00:31:06,173 --> 00:31:08,453
他们需要一个继承人来保存土地
They need an heir to keep their land.

597
00:31:12,433 --> 00:31:14,613
而不是霜糖饼

你是怎么跟你另外两个同伙联系的?
How are you communicating with your other two associates?

601
00:31:26,073 --> 00:31:29,683
通讯录里仅有的一个号码是6位数的
The only number stored on your contacts list is six numbers long.

602
00:31:29,903 --> 00:31:32,223
你总是缺胳膊少腿的是吧?
You're always missing a couple of digits,aren't you?

603
00:31:34,263 --> 00:31:35,203
也许这并不是写错的
Well,maybe that's not a mistake.

604
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,483
也许这是别的什么东西
Maybe it's something else.

605
00:31:38,983 --> 00:31:39,873
坐标?
Coordinates?

606
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:43,783

Radio frequency.

608
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:53,253
我觉得是无线频率
I'm gonna go with radio frequency.

609
00:31:53,853 --> 00:31:55,953
你们永远不知道了
You will never get it now.

610
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,913
我们已经记下来了 聪明蛋
We wrote it down,genius.

611
00:31:58,593 --> 00:32:01,653
如果他们用的是无线系统 我们应该能听到他们唠嗑
If they're using radio systems,we should be able to pick up some chatter.

612
00:32:01,663 --> 00:32:03,123
来吧
**

613
00:32:06,363 --> 00:32:07,593
好吧 发动
Okay,try it.

614
00:32:16,613 --> 00:32:17,783
再来一次
Try it again.

615
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,703
就目前来看 这可是个大问题
Given the parts available,this could prove to be a problem.

616
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:26,053
这不是我们唯一的问题
that's not our only problem.

617
00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:28,073
我的羊水刚刚破了
My water just broke.

618
00:32:28,183 --> 00:32:29,753
我要生了
I'm going into labor.

619
00:32:32,393 --> 00:32:33,783
呜啦?
Ooh-rah?

620
00:32:44,914 --> 00:32:47,684
很好 你们终于搞清楚追杀孕妇 的不是政府部门了
It's good to know you no longer think the government's hunting a pregnant woman,

621
00:32:47,734 --> 00:32:51,974
DiNozzo探员 但是恐怕我也不能告知 任何有关男方家那边的消息
<i>Agent DiNozzo,but I'm afraid I can't help you apprehend the Afghan in-laws that are.</i>

622
00:32:52,034 --> 00:32:53,494
今天可是平安夜 长官
It is Christmas Eve,sir.

623
00:32:53,534 --> 00:32:58,294
哼 这份礼物得由中央司令部送给你才成 里面的人可比我高个14级
Well,that gift would have to come from CENTCOM and about 14 other people above my pay grade.

624
00:32:58,344 --> 00:33:00,714
哦 让我猜猜 上面还缠满了官僚主义的红丝带?
Yeah.Let me guess - it'd be wrapped in red tape?

625
00:33:00,744 --> 00:33:01,944
多谢你啥也没帮上
Thanks for nothing.

626
00:33:03,684 --> 00:33:06,464
枪手的无线频道里有发现
Got something from our gunman's radio frequency.

627
00:33:07,524 --> 00:33:09,904
从如此微弱的信号来看 他们起码40英里以外
And given the weak signal,they got to be at least 40 miles away.

628
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:11,234
你在哪?
Where are you?

629
00:33:11,284 --> 00:33:12,254
不远
Not too far.

630
00:33:12,314 --> 00:33:13,124

631
00:33:13,154 --> 00:33:14,954
吉维尔镇外的加油站 现在马上

632
00:33:15,014 --> 00:33:16,674
听起来像是俄罗斯人

633
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,784
搜索吉维尔镇附近的加油站
Searching for gas stations near Ridgeville,Maryland.

634
00:33:19,944 --> 00:33:21,254
地方不大
Pretty small town.

635
00:33:21,304 --> 00:33:25,104
我找到了 15号国道边上的一家加油站
All right,I got a hit on a single service station alongside State Route 15.

636
00:33:25,264 --> 00:33:27,394
他们往那里去的唯一一个理由就是
Only one reason our gunmen would go there.

637
00:33:27,544 --> 00:33:28,594
Gibbs - Gibbs
- Gibbs. - Gibbs.

638
00:33:28,664 --> 00:33:29,654
他们有麻烦了
They're in trouble.

639
00:33:29,704 --> 00:33:31,054
那里应该就是他们被搁延的地方
It could be where they're holed up.

640
00:33:40,224 --> 00:33:41,134
你们找到Gibbs探员了?
You find Agent Gibbs?

641
00:33:41,194 --> 00:33:42,934
我们马上就会知道的
That's what we're gonna find out.

642
00:33:45,604 --> 00:33:47,204
带上装备 McGee
Put it in gear,McGee.

643
00:33:49,844 --> 00:33:51,254
祝好运
Good luck.

644
00:33:51,874 --> 00:33:53,734
是啊 好运
Yeah.Good luck.

645
00:33:55,414 --> 00:33:57,264
你为什么这样阴阳怪气的说话?
Why in the world would you say it like that?

646
00:33:58,224 --> 00:34:01,944
为 为什么?这破天气 路都封了 他们肯定没法找到的
Wh-Why?The weather,the road closures,'cause they're never gonna make it.

647
00:34:02,034 --> 00:34:03,634
你又怎么知道?
<i>How the hell would you know?</i>

648
00:34:03,694 --> 00:34:05,414
他们都是训练有素的探员
They're trained agents.

649
00:34:05,514 --> 00:34:07,184
呃...
Well...

650
00:34:07,494 --> 00:34:10,124
你可以不尊重我和我们的工作
You might not respect me or what it is we do here,

651
00:34:10,164 --> 00:34:12,904
但是你不能不尊重这样一个事实 这些人
but you have got to respect that fact that these people--

652
00:34:12,964 --> 00:34:15,834
我们的同伴 正在冒着生命危险!
my people - are risking their lives!

653
00:34:17,584 --> 00:34:19,164
呃 如果你硬要这么说的话...
Well,if you're gonna put it like that...

654
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,644
这是毋庸置疑的事实
There's no other way to put it.

655
00:34:20,674 --> 00:34:23,744
我们哪也不去 直到你意识到这点为止
Till you can figure that out,we're not going anywhere.

656
00:34:24,444 --> 00:34:26,754
坐下 然后闭嘴
Sit down and shut up.

657
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,464
最后两次宫缩间隔不到一分钟了
The last two were less than a minute apart.

658
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:43,074
我在摩苏尔中了榴霰弹也没那么疼
It didn't hurt this much when I took shrapnel in Mosul.

659
00:34:43,194 --> 00:34:44,664
整个线路肯定是熟了
The whole harness must be sautd.

660
00:34:44,884 --> 00:34:46,844
是烧了
Fried.

661
00:34:58,044 --> 00:35:00,754
哦 天 宝宝要出来了!
Oh,boy,the baby's coming!

662

663
00:35:03,104 --> 00:35:04,144
我们有访客了
We have company.

664
00:35:04,214 --> 00:35:05,634
你打算怎么做?
What do you want to do?

665
00:35:06,364 --> 00:35:07,864
守住我们的领地
Defend our position.

666
00:35:12,984 --> 00:35:15,044
你跟上尉一块 我去对付他们
You stay with the lieutenant; I'll draw fire.

667
00:35:15,184 --> 00:35:16,844
别离开我 Gibbs
Don't you leave me,Gibbs.

668
00:35:17,214 --> 00:35:19,744
我需要有人告诉我怎么做
I need someone to tell me how I'm doing.

669
00:35:20,844 --> 00:35:22,614
你表现得很好
You're doing fine.

670
00:35:22,684 --> 00:35:24,084
我可不确定
I'm not so sure.

671
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:29,974
你是在要求特殊对待吗 陆战队员?
Are you asking for special treatment,Marine?

672
00:35:30,024 --> 00:35:31,594
长官 是的 长官
Sir,yes,sir.

673
00:35:31,634 --> 00:35:33,014
就这一次
Just this once.

674
00:35:33,094 --> 00:35:34,104
嘿 Gibbs?
Hey,Gibbs?

675
00:35:40,824 --> 00:35:42,864
没问题 我去掩护
It's okay. Got this covered.

676
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:48,154
谢谢
Thank you.
