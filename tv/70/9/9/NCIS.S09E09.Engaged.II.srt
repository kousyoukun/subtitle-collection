1
00:00:03,445 --> 00:00:05,463
- We're going down.
- Chaplain Burke.

2
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,924
I just transferred
to the chapel here on the Navy Yard.

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,467
Her body was on at plane.

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:12,015
- What's her name?
- First Lieutenant Gabriela Flores.

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,888
There were only two Marines,
in those three cases.

6
00:00:14,972 --> 00:00:16,265
Flores wasn't one of them.

7
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,601
We will do whatever it takes
to find her and bring her home.

8
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,210
No Marine is ever left behind.

9
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:24,107
Flores was blindsided in an attack on
a girls' school she was helping rebuild.

10
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,150
It was the people
she was working with?

11
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,317
That's the teacher.

12
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:29,144
Anyone who worked
at that school could be in on this.

13
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:31,489
- That's gotta be her.
- Are those children?!

14
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,282
She was trying to save them,
and she got caught.

15
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,659
Don't come back without her.

16
00:01:18,905 --> 00:01:19,827
Go ahead.

17
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,942
Ask.

18
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,154
Ask what?

19
00:01:27,885 --> 00:01:29,305
Tell Him what you're thinking.

20
00:01:30,848 --> 00:01:34,358
In my experience,
He's not a big talker,

21
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:37,444
but His actions speak volumes.

22
00:01:38,263 --> 00:01:40,402
His actions have been questionable.

23
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,680
Your daughter, Gabriela,

24
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:48,010
tried to save those kids.

25
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:52,283
She dedicated her life
to serving her country.

26
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:55,679
If she's any indication
of His actions, then

27
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,347
I have to disagree.

28
00:01:57,737 --> 00:01:59,619
She should have gone back
to base that night.

29
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,058
- She should have followed orders.
- Yes.

30
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,379
But by following her instincts,

31
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:12,232
maybe she was following
His orders instead.

32
00:02:20,272 --> 00:02:21,853
Can Gibbs bring her back?

33
00:02:23,753 --> 00:02:26,363
Well, look, I haven't known
Special Agent Gibbs for very long,

34
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:29,484
but he's a good man
and he's working with the best.

35
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,596
So I have faith they they will do
everything they can to find her.

36
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:37,308
I know they'll find her, Chaplain.

37
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:40,395
The question is will she be alive?

38
00:02:50,555 --> 00:02:51,845
What is it?

39
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:19,031

43
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:05,578
Welcome to the belly of the beast.

44
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:08,372
- Smooth ride?
- Till somebody started shooting us.

45
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,832
It's Kabul's welcome wagon.

46
00:04:10,452 --> 00:04:12,738
Next time, bake cookies.
What's the status?

47
00:04:12,822 --> 00:04:14,803
Got some locals
to change their story.

48
00:04:15,061 --> 00:04:17,499
They confirmed Lieutenant Flores
and the two girls were taken.

49
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,300
Did they identify the insurgents?

50
00:04:19,596 --> 00:04:22,637
Changing their story is one thing,
but giving up names gets folks killed.

51
00:04:22,877 --> 00:04:25,417
- People are afraid to talk.
- So why keep Flores alive?

52
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:26,898
Information.

53
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,490
Radicals don't like Westerners
opening up their kids' eyes.

54
00:04:29,947 --> 00:04:32,813
167 schools were hit last year
throughout the Middle East.

55
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:35,015
More than half were
in Afghanistan alone.

56
00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:37,590
And as a FET, Flores knows
where new ones are being built.

57
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:40,488
FETs act as a conduit between
the locals and the Corps.

58
00:04:40,873 --> 00:04:42,768
I'll introduce you
to Staff Sergeant Littleton.

59
00:04:42,852 --> 00:04:44,075
She was there that night.

60
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,993
Schools can be
a big part of what they do.

61
00:04:46,228 --> 00:04:48,111
Good news is the 2 girls that Flores

62
00:04:48,195 --> 00:04:50,081
saved were just found
about 7 clicks due south.

63
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,569
Abandoned roadside. They're being
transported here for treatment.

64
00:04:52,653 --> 00:04:53,708
Are they all right?

65
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:57,338
Dehydrated, scared,
clearly tortured.

66
00:04:57,606 --> 00:04:58,588
But alive.

67
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:00,216
We'll need see them.

68
00:05:00,894 --> 00:05:02,843
As long as you're prepared
for what you'll see.

69
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:04,761
I grew up in this region.

70
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:07,473
Looks like you turned out okay.

71
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,183
I can hold my own.

72
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:11,000
Copy that.

73
00:05:19,762 --> 00:05:20,987
Staff Sergeant Littleton.

74
00:05:23,158 --> 00:05:25,540
- C.O. says you wanted to see me?
- Yeah. Sit down.

75
00:05:30,187 --> 00:05:31,134
Understand that

76
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:33,666
you were with Flores
the night the school was attacked.

77
00:05:34,857 --> 00:05:37,795
I already gave a statement
to the Investigative Unit, sir.

78
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:40,256
I know, but I just got
here and I'm anxious to hear.

79
00:05:41,056 --> 00:05:43,537
There's nothing really
different to say.

80
00:05:43,745 --> 00:05:45,261
Just trying to get a clear picture.

81
00:05:50,136 --> 00:05:53,504
A bunch of us evacuated
before all hell broke loose.

82
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,949
I thought we were
all together in a seven-ton.

83
00:05:57,945 --> 00:06:00,376
I kept yelling her name,
but she didn't answer.

84
00:06:01,248 --> 00:06:02,358
She couldn't answer.

85
00:06:04,972 --> 00:06:07,491
If I'd have stayed with Gabby,
she might not be in this mess.

86
00:06:07,942 --> 00:06:09,395
Or you might be dead.

87
00:06:15,214 --> 00:06:16,569
Know that woman?

88
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,131
Soraya?

89
00:06:18,983 --> 00:06:20,585
She's one of the fortunate ones.

90
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:22,299
Fortunate? How?

91
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,147
She wasn't at school that day.

92
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,607
She was seeing
her family outside Kabul.

93
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,188
Have you seen her since?

94
00:06:35,881 --> 00:06:38,918
We think
that she used being a teacher

95
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,971
to know when to strike.

96
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:44,583
The kids trusted Soraya.

97
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:47,615
We all did.

98
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:50,833
- She took advantage of that trust.
- And she succeeded, sir.

99
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:52,027
At being a coward.

100
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,940
Now it's our turn.

101
00:07:03,944 --> 00:07:07,650
We may believe that every one
should be taught to read and write,

102
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:11,079
there are still some in the Middle East
who do not see it that way.

103
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:15,267
Yeah, but on the other hand, back in
the Crusades, the Knights Templar,

104
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:17,977
they were willing to kill
for what they held sacred.

105
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:21,762
Tragically, in both instances,
innocent children suffer.

106
00:07:21,846 --> 00:07:23,526
A battle for young hearts and minds.

107
00:07:23,828 --> 00:07:27,352
And Lieutenant Flores found herself
at the very center of that battle.

108
00:07:27,436 --> 00:07:28,509
Look at you two...

109
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:30,449
hitting Wong's after hours

110
00:07:30,762 --> 00:07:33,497
and talking the night away like
a couple of college coeds.

111
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:37,089
Commander Burke offers
a perspective I find quite...

112
00:07:37,464 --> 00:07:38,374
provocative.

113
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:40,584
I bet you do, Ducky.

114
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:44,380
Anyway, we're tired
and waiting for answers.

115
00:07:45,807 --> 00:07:47,536
That was Homeland Security.

116
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,301
The Jaysh El-Mo'mineen

117
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,680
have links to terror cells in Yemen,
Saudi Arabia and the Philippines.

118
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,005
What's the next step?

119
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:56,586
We need one of those
cells to turn on our radicals.

120
00:07:56,946 --> 00:07:59,812
The less that they trust each other,
the more we can destabilize them.

121
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:01,537
What about you, Tony?

122
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:02,773
Me?

123
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,860
I hope you're not wasting your time
on that bucket list

124
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,153
I keep hearing about.

125
00:08:07,507 --> 00:08:08,863
It's not a waste of time...

126
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,544
Oh, ye of little faith.

127
00:08:10,913 --> 00:08:12,871
Present company excluded, of course.

128
00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:15,827
Yeah, I am working on bucket list.

129
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:19,925
Perhaps all this talk of terrorism
has me anxious about certain...

130
00:08:20,857 --> 00:08:21,750
insecurities.

131
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:23,836
You, DiNozzo?

132
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,677
Yes, me.

133
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:32,178
Shocking, but beneath this incredibly
masculine body armor,

134
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,847
there is a vulnerable do-gooder.

135
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,212
Vulnerable to...?

136
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:42,479
Telling you would be like Superman
telling Lex Luthor

137
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,946
about his vulnerability
to Kryptonite.

138
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,302
It's not gonna happen.

139
00:08:46,386 --> 00:08:48,324
So what is it, Clark Kent?

140
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:51,252
What are you so afraid of?

141
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:55,576
- Good morning, Agent Gibbs.
- <i>Evening, Director.</i>

142
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:59,049
<i>That you in the background,
Mr. Secretary?</i>

143
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,369
<i>Burning the candle
at both ends, Sir.</i>

144
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,628
<i>Careful,
people are gonna think you care.</i>

145
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:07,087
Nice scarf.

146
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:09,924
- <i>Update.</i>
- Boss, we got an I.D.

147
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,967
on our loving Afghan teacher.

148
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,971
This is from a classified military
personnel file on the school.

149
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,848
Full name is Soraya Zoranj.

150
00:09:18,164 --> 00:09:19,579
Grew up in Baghlan, Afghanistan.

151
00:09:19,663 --> 00:09:21,914
Parents were killed by
the Russians when she was a teenager.

152
00:09:21,998 --> 00:09:24,012
Soraya also had two siblings:

153
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:28,037
an older brother, Osman, who died
in an IED explosion two years ago,

154
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:30,892
and a younger brother, Asa,

155
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:33,244
who's in the U.S. on a student visa.

156
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:35,929
- He's going to law school here in DC.
<i>- Talk to him.</i>

157
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:38,077
Think he might keep
in contact with the big sis'?

158
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:39,175
<i>Find out.</i>

159
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,171
On it.

160
00:09:42,473 --> 00:09:45,314
I love the smell
of coeds in the morning.

161
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,670
You need coffee.

162
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:48,800
So do I.

163
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:51,529
Working on Afghan time is
messing up our internal clocks.

164
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,790
I used to thrive on all-night
stakeouts and sub-zero surveillance.

165
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,141
Maybe this is a sign something's
missing from my life.

166
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:00,849
Like what, frostbite?

167
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:04,842
The kid's roommate told us Asa
spent all night in the law library.

168
00:10:04,926 --> 00:10:07,150
- Might as well start there.
- I hate libraries.

169
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:08,812
Another one of your fears?

170
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:10,526
Don't mock me.

171
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,519
What's to hate about libraries?

172
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:14,363
The smell gets me every time.

173
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,190
Yeah? What does
a library smell like?

174
00:10:16,474 --> 00:10:18,008
Lonely smart people.

175
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:23,705
Tony, that's our guy.
Soraya's brother.

176
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:25,310
Hey, kid.

177
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,501
We'd like to talk
to you for a second.

178
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,135
Can we ask you a few questions?

179
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:32,006
Now I'm gonna spill my latte!

180
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,815
You cannot do this!
I've done nothing wrong!

181
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:47,765
- Then why'd you run?
- You owe me another coffee.

182
00:11:00,902 --> 00:11:03,736
It's funny we should find
you with your nose in a book.

183
00:11:04,934 --> 00:11:06,707
Why is that funny to you?

184
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:10,091
All those kids wanted
was a chance to read.

185
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:12,921
Those girls...

186
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:16,001
just wanted to learn something.

187
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:19,326
And yet, here you are,

188
00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:22,379
enjoying all the benefits
of an American education.

189
00:11:23,472 --> 00:11:25,689
You are a country of
extraordinary power.

190
00:11:26,274 --> 00:11:27,186
I see.

191
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,609
Study the power,

192
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:30,372
find the weakness?

193
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:34,388
Let me ask you a question.

194
00:11:35,757 --> 00:11:38,308
You think those kids
really threaten your way of life?

195
00:11:39,502 --> 00:11:43,157
You know nothing about our way of life,
our culture.

196
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,111
I know plenty.

197
00:11:50,368 --> 00:11:54,207
I also know a closed-minded,
radical parasite when I see one.

198
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:56,815
The kind that likes
to prey on innocent children.

199
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:03,847
Your ignorance is amusing.

200
00:12:04,273 --> 00:12:05,978
You know what I find amusing?

201
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:11,639
The idea of you in
a tiny little orange jumpsuit,

202
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:15,754
all alone in a six-by-six
cell crying for mommy.

203
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:20,105
I will not spend one minute

204
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,074
in your filthy prison.

205
00:12:22,815 --> 00:12:23,920
I wouldn't bet on it.

206
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:26,328
Unless, of course, you want

207
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,859
to give us the name
of your little gang of school haters.

208
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:31,959
How many are there?

209
00:12:33,103 --> 00:12:34,388
We are few,

210
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,037
but...

211
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,269
we are very strong.

212
00:12:43,057 --> 00:12:44,471
You cannot defeat us.

213
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,230
Say it again.
You're breaking up.

214
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,274
Soraya's little brother, we got him.

215
00:12:55,822 --> 00:12:58,110
- He tell you where his sister is?
- <i>Not yet.</i>

216
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,186
- But we're squeezing him.
- Squeeze tighter.

217
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,266
I need her.

218
00:13:01,707 --> 00:13:03,259
She's the best hope we have...

219
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:27,907
Hey, Matteson.

220
00:13:29,787 --> 00:13:31,734
I thought everyone
was going to the E-club.

221
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,139
They are.

222
00:13:33,223 --> 00:13:34,646
Thought I'd get out instead.

223
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,699
You want me to take a look?

224
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,741
But you can start the engine.
Make yourself useful.

225
00:13:55,786 --> 00:13:57,926
- You sure you don't want me to...
- Again.

226
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,013
You know,
I really should know better by now.

227
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:09,731
Yes, you should.

228
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,092
I'm headed to Pendleton soon.

229
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:15,687
I heard
maybe you're going there, too.

230
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:18,203
Okinawa.

231
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:19,650
Next week.

232
00:14:22,706 --> 00:14:23,718
Japan.

233
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:27,807
Well, good luck over there.

234
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:31,119
You know, Gibbs...

235
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:33,977
if you ever find
yourself in Japan...

236
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:36,630
or even if you don't...

237
00:14:39,073 --> 00:14:40,664
I'll always be around.

238
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,909
Give me a call.

239
00:14:44,022 --> 00:14:45,133
I'd like that.

240
00:14:52,532 --> 00:14:54,108
The girls, Gibbs.
Did you hear?

241
00:14:55,624 --> 00:14:57,896
Hear what?
I had Tony. I lost him.

242
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,340
The girls Flores saved.

243
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:00,732
They are here.

244
00:15:29,644 --> 00:15:31,075
Girls are both orphans.

245
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:33,822
Parents were killed by insurgents.

246
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:36,089
What are their ages?

247
00:15:36,378 --> 00:15:37,462
10 and 13.

248
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:41,291
Already been through more
than anyone should in a lifetime.

249
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,589
Hot grease was thrown
in the older one's face.

250
00:15:44,673 --> 00:15:46,856
The other one's covered
in cigarette burns.

251
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:50,568
Their names are Kinah and Lala.

252
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,211
We need to ask you some questions.

253
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,638
Do you remember Lieutenant Flores?

254
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:16,389
Gabriela?

255
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:19,770
Gabby?

256
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:22,105
Gabby! Yes.
She still there.

257
00:16:22,737 --> 00:16:25,654
- You go bring?
- Gabby, Gabby she's still alive?

258
00:16:33,085 --> 00:16:34,198
They're not...

259
00:16:35,065 --> 00:16:36,244
done yet.

260
00:16:39,355 --> 00:16:40,582
Notify the commandant.

261
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,938
Tell him we're a go.

262
00:16:42,473 --> 00:16:43,904
Flores could still be alive.

263
00:16:44,726 --> 00:16:45,868
That's very good.

264
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,250
You know that you're both safe here.

265
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,943
Can you tell us about Gabby?

266
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:09,625
They hurt her.

267
00:17:11,242 --> 00:17:12,406
No cry.

268
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:15,534
Do you remember anything about
where these people took you?

269
00:17:18,924 --> 00:17:20,414
It smelled bad?

270
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,112
Like what?

271
00:17:25,018 --> 00:17:25,877
Car.

272
00:17:26,377 --> 00:17:28,546
And ground, it was black.

273
00:17:31,112 --> 00:17:32,124
Oil.

274
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,514
Ziva, we need a sample.

275
00:17:37,121 --> 00:17:39,558
And then you get them
anything they want.

276
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,695
You never stop smiling, okay?

277
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,319
Abby,
did you get the sample analysis?

278
00:18:00,403 --> 00:18:02,897
McGee, I have decided
that I am never going to complain

279
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,125
about anything ever, ever again.

280
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,378
How can I whine about the cost
of my DVD-by-mail service when

281
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,465
- there's real problems in this world?
- When you put it that way.

282
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,156
Take this evidence, for example.

283
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,715
Normally, I would whine
about not being able to

284
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,497
examine the actual item.

285
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:20,098
But given that we are 4,000
miles from Afghanistan,

286
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,059
we have to settle for a basic chemical
breakdown from the Marine unit.

287
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:26,563
And I took their breakdown
and I made lemonade.

288
00:18:27,077 --> 00:18:30,192
Who knew that geochemistry
could be so cool?

289
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,611
You know, I actually took
a college class in fossil fuels.

290
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:33,904
Of course you did.

291
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:38,183
Just like the chemical compositions of
plant life are unique to any given area,

292
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:41,369
crude oil deposits
are like a geographic fingerprint.

293
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:45,207
This is from outside Kabul,
Afghanistan, on the Afghan pipeline.

294
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,751
There was no oil where
the girls were found, so...

295
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,117
So it's probably where
they were being held captive.

296
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:52,988
And where Lieutenant Flores
still might be.

297
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,656
Commander?

298
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:06,502
Chaplain Burke? Hello?

299
00:19:07,204 --> 00:19:08,476
Anybody here?

300
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,426
Anybody here?

301
00:19:13,838 --> 00:19:15,027
Cool Hand Luke.

302
00:19:17,337 --> 00:19:18,682
Of course, You knew that.

303
00:19:20,816 --> 00:19:24,175
I could've used You a couple months ago.
Got my head scrambled pretty good.

304
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:28,499
Of course,
I understand You're a busy guy.

305
00:19:29,812 --> 00:19:31,186
We haven't talked much.

306
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,762
That's my bad.

307
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,658
I'm doing the best I can down here,
you know.

308
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:48,292
For a DiNozzo.

309
00:19:51,234 --> 00:19:52,246
Hopefully

310
00:19:52,954 --> 00:19:54,993
living up to my end of the bargain.

311
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,610
You do remember

312
00:19:58,810 --> 00:19:59,851
our bargain?

313
00:20:02,745 --> 00:20:04,075
Be nice to hear from You.

314
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:06,770
So You have a plan?

315
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,577
Anything You want to

316
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:10,558
share with me?

317
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,715
How about You let me know
I'm on the right track?

318
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:20,224
How about You let me know
I'm not talking to myself?

319
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:24,517
You are so predictable.

320
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,698
Well, I guess what we have here

321
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,271
is a failure to communicate.

322
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,066
You looking for me?

323
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,112
Chaplain.

324
00:20:39,612 --> 00:20:42,532
Tell Joseph Flores we think we know
where his daughter might be.

325
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,525
I'm getting out of here.

326
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:52,330
Extraction team in place.

327
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:53,752
Zero hour.

328
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,935
That's what they call it.

329
00:20:56,702 --> 00:20:59,188
I'd like to take this time
to wish everyone luck.

330
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:02,592
<i>Luck's for the unprepared,
Mr. Secretary.</i>

331
00:21:02,939 --> 00:21:04,721
I'd rather have it than not,
General.

332
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,683
Game on.
Scopes and helmet cams.

333
00:21:13,987 --> 00:21:15,440
Air support's on standby.

334
00:21:16,805 --> 00:21:20,070
Thermals indicate five people.
The one on the ground's probably Flores.

335
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,988
Okay. Let's do this.

336
00:21:30,442 --> 00:21:31,289
Corpsman!

337
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:34,960
Go! Go! Go!

338
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,051
Pressure.

339
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:40,715
You hang in there.

340
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,595
I got him, sir.

341
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,265
Keep breathing, Captain.

342
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,392
Go, go, go!

343
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,375
That's her.

344
00:22:19,537 --> 00:22:20,549
Fine, sir.

345
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:24,811
Your call.

346
00:22:26,124 --> 00:22:27,208
Give me a reason.

347
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,978
So what's it gonna be?

348
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:36,771
Feed you to the locals

349
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:40,333
lifetime at Gitmo,
or you die right here?

350
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,937
Target's secure!

351
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:26,335
Don't you say a word.

352
00:23:40,456 --> 00:23:43,083
- How am I doing?
- You're doing great. Just hold on.

353
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:44,702
We're gonna need 3 liters of O-neg.

354
00:23:44,786 --> 00:23:46,883
I gotta get him lidocaine.
Anybody call for medevac?

355
00:23:47,562 --> 00:23:48,593
It's on the way.

356
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,470
Ma'am, I can take it from here,
step back.

357
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:54,724
Don't go, David.

358
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,477
I'm not leaving you.

359
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,463
- I need you...
- I said I am not leaving!

360
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,109
You look at me, Captain.
Look at me.

361
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,261
That's right.

362
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:07,159
My mom and dad.

363
00:24:08,561 --> 00:24:09,602
Tell them...

364
00:24:10,795 --> 00:24:11,908
I'm sorry.

365
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,051
Where are they?

366
00:24:13,472 --> 00:24:14,700
What are their names?

367
00:24:15,168 --> 00:24:17,038
Come on. Stay with me.

368
00:24:17,563 --> 00:24:18,575
Maryland.

369
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:20,583
They own

370
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:23,421
a small motel on the bay.

371
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,242
You have to tell them...

372
00:24:28,505 --> 00:24:29,551
I love them.

373
00:24:31,081 --> 00:24:32,223
I promise I will.

374
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,180
I promise
I will tell them everything.

375
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,390
We'll get you home.

376
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:04,615
What is it?

377
00:25:10,353 --> 00:25:11,384
We got her, sir.

378
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,471
Yo daughter Gabriela, she's alive.

379
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,514
Thank you.

380
00:25:17,063 --> 00:25:18,183
God bless you.

381
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:21,769
She's alive!
She's alive!

382
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,387
Drink.

383
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:34,250
I have been, sir.

384
00:25:36,129 --> 00:25:37,358
Drink some more.

385
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:41,348
There are some folks happy
to hear you're alive, Lieutenant.

386
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:43,702
I know.

387
00:25:44,107 --> 00:25:45,582
Your dad's pretty happy, too.

388
00:25:46,437 --> 00:25:48,650
- I'm anxious to see him.
- Yeah, I bet you are.

389
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:52,322
Quincy, sir...

390
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,313
he wouldn't be dead if I hadn't...

391
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,063
if I hadn't...

392
00:25:59,147 --> 00:26:01,113
Quincy died doing his job.

393
00:26:03,665 --> 00:26:05,328
He was your commanding officer.

394
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:08,495
That made you his responsibility.

395
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,446
Why'd you do it?

396
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:17,655
Running off with the kids,
disobeying orders.

397
00:26:18,582 --> 00:26:19,955
I didn't have a choice.

398
00:26:20,476 --> 00:26:22,500
I knew what would happen
to those girls.

399
00:26:24,344 --> 00:26:25,821
If I had to do it again...

400
00:26:25,905 --> 00:26:26,917
You would.

401
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:28,001
Yes, sir.

402
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,689
People died because of that teacher.

403
00:26:40,675 --> 00:26:42,482
What do you think
should happen to her?

404
00:26:44,902 --> 00:26:46,543
Sir, that's not my decision.

405
00:26:46,627 --> 00:26:48,270
But you've thought about it, right?

406
00:26:52,298 --> 00:26:54,553
She should be held accountable
for her crimes.

407
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:57,227
How?

408
00:27:03,032 --> 00:27:04,810
She should watch

409
00:27:05,316 --> 00:27:08,366
those girls change the world
in positive ways

410
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:10,260
she never imagined.

411
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:13,817
That a punishment?

412
00:27:14,222 --> 00:27:16,116
That's a gift, sir.

413
00:27:17,655 --> 00:27:19,867
Punishment is knowing
she could have done the same.

414
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,699
You're rare, Flores.

415
00:27:29,412 --> 00:27:31,232
Come on. Let's go home.

416
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,310
- What?
- Nothing.

417
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:45,078
Definitely something. What?

418
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,499
You intrigue me.

419
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:51,430
Why?

420
00:27:52,112 --> 00:27:54,226
When something's broken,
I want to fix it.

421
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,768
I hate to break it to you, but you ain't
got enough tools in your woodshed.

422
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,691
You might be surprised.

423
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:05,801
So how do I intrigue you?

424
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:07,873
In a naughty Catholic schoolgirl
kind of way

425
00:28:07,957 --> 00:28:11,337
because I'm in need of what your kind
calls "spiritual guidance"?

426
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:13,082
Well, lucky for me, the latter.

427
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:16,595
You don't have to worry about me.
I'm rock solid in the spirit department.

428
00:28:17,491 --> 00:28:18,850
That's fascinating.

429
00:28:20,392 --> 00:28:22,158
You know what's even
more fascinating?

430
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,223
No, what's that?

431
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,117
I don't believe you.

432
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:30,068
When you're ready to face that fear,
Agent DiNozzo

433
00:28:30,805 --> 00:28:32,439
I'm ready to face it with you.

434
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:52,822
You know...

435
00:28:54,505 --> 00:28:56,086
I was just trying to save them.

436
00:28:57,322 --> 00:28:58,277
And you did.

437
00:29:00,195 --> 00:29:03,116
- Should've been me in that box.
- No, Lieutenant.

438
00:29:04,453 --> 00:29:06,652
And it should not have
been Captain Quincy either.

439
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:20,716
What's going on?
What's it say?

440
00:29:20,972 --> 00:29:23,476
Helo went down. Lost six Marines.

441
00:29:23,915 --> 00:29:25,805
- Where?
- Okinawa, Japan.

442
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:27,557
Poor bastards just got there.

443
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,601
I think that Matteson
girl was one of them.

444
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,851
I never actually talked to her,
but she beat three of my course times.

445
00:29:34,084 --> 00:29:35,979
She was good.
Hell of an athlete.

446
00:29:37,367 --> 00:29:38,867
Gibbs, you remember Matteson.

447
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:08,806
<i>Present arms!</i>

448
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,677
<i>Present arms!</i>

449
00:31:12,225 --> 00:31:13,725
Welcome to my classroom.

450
00:31:14,516 --> 00:31:15,610
Why am I here?

451
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:19,005
Instead of a direct flight to Gitmo,
I thought we could talk.

452
00:31:19,553 --> 00:31:21,945
Have a family reunion.

453
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:23,975
I have nothing to say.

454
00:31:25,222 --> 00:31:27,107
When was the last time
you saw each other?

455
00:31:27,968 --> 00:31:29,534
No, let me guess.

456
00:31:30,608 --> 00:31:32,341
Terrorist convention in Toledo?

457
00:31:32,671 --> 00:31:34,850
Mock me all you want, Agent Gibbs,

458
00:31:35,198 --> 00:31:37,436
you will never
understand our motivation.

459
00:31:38,045 --> 00:31:41,764
You gained the trust of these kids,
and then you hurt 'em.

460
00:31:42,114 --> 00:31:44,261
By teaching future generations

461
00:31:44,345 --> 00:31:47,113
not to be influenced
by your histrionic lies?

462
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:49,996
In this country,
teaching children is a privilege.

463
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,570
In this country,

464
00:31:51,855 --> 00:31:54,855
you waste money sending
your kids to college to have fun.

465
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:59,542
- They're taught to think on their own.
- They are rich, spoiled brats.

466
00:32:00,554 --> 00:32:02,277
This is how you answer that?

467
00:32:02,986 --> 00:32:04,672
You're radicals who maim

468
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,716
and kill innocent children,

469
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,802
because they want to learn
how other people think?!

470
00:32:10,034 --> 00:32:12,162
You think we do this for ourselves?!

471
00:32:12,868 --> 00:32:14,807
You come into our villages and towns

472
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,518
with your disgusting Western ideals.

473
00:32:17,763 --> 00:32:21,439
You teach our children
to question their heritage,

474
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:24,224
to rely on the Internet
instead of the Koran.

475
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,322
Yes, this is our answer.

476
00:32:26,406 --> 00:32:28,025
It is the only answer.

477
00:32:29,192 --> 00:32:30,531
And you will see.

478
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,992
I'll see.

479
00:32:34,972 --> 00:32:36,026
I'll see what?

480
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:37,526
You are here.

481
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,036
We are here.

482
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,144
Lieutenant Flores is here.

483
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,043
And our older brother is here, too.

484
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:44,128
Asa, don't!

485
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:48,212
According to our file, he's dead.

486
00:32:52,693 --> 00:32:54,416
You think our fight is over.

487
00:32:56,646 --> 00:32:57,376
But...

488
00:32:59,028 --> 00:33:00,406
it has just begun.

489
00:33:12,918 --> 00:33:14,407
Look what the Corps sent back.

490
00:33:18,218 --> 00:33:19,526
Rough trip, Ziva?

491
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,957
"Rough" is an understatement, McGee.

492
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:24,416
Lieutenant Flores is back.

493
00:33:25,824 --> 00:33:27,112
As is Captain Quincy.

494
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:31,622
And there lies the scratch.

495
00:33:31,921 --> 00:33:32,810
The rub.

496
00:33:32,894 --> 00:33:35,680
- "There lies the rub." It's a classic.
- I need some rest.

497
00:33:36,028 --> 00:33:38,509
No rest for the weary, Ziva.
Party isn't over yet.

498
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:42,234
- Older brother, talk to me.
- Osman Zoranj, 38 years old.

499
00:33:42,318 --> 00:33:43,688
Born in Helmand Province.

500
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:46,922
Fought with the Mujahideen for
seven years against the Soviets.

501
00:33:47,006 --> 00:33:48,526
Raised to the rank of commander.

502
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,846
Helped drive the Russian
occupiers out of Kabul.

503
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,322
- War hero.
- Until he joined the Taliban.

504
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,379
And he brought
his brother and sister with him.

505
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,492
- Tell me something new.
- I got something here.

506
00:33:57,777 --> 00:33:59,074
According to the DIA,

507
00:33:59,158 --> 00:34:01,163
Osman was killed
in an apartment complex,

508
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,332
raid in Gardez, Afghanistan,
two years ago.

509
00:34:03,516 --> 00:34:05,626
Raid set off a gas-line explosion.

510
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,460
Osman was among two dozen dead.

511
00:34:07,824 --> 00:34:09,419
Not according to his siblings.

512
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,965
- And you believe them?
- Yeah.

513
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:12,957
D.C.?

514
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,176
You tell me.

515
00:34:14,477 --> 00:34:16,352
Putting out a BOLO
on the "Oos-Mahn".

516
00:34:17,315 --> 00:34:18,817
We need Asa's cell records.

517
00:34:18,901 --> 00:34:19,868
Already on it.

518
00:34:19,952 --> 00:34:23,616
Also alerting LEOs at the train depots,
bus stations and airports.

519
00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:26,162
Homeland and Metro PD.

520
00:34:26,373 --> 00:34:28,429
This group is up to something.
Find out what.

521
00:34:28,513 --> 00:34:31,277
If Osman's little brother
had been in D.C. the whole time...

522
00:34:31,544 --> 00:34:33,389
He might know where
the big brother is.

523
00:34:35,435 --> 00:34:37,677
- Did you lose something, Gibbs?
- Yeah, knife.

524
00:34:38,336 --> 00:34:40,494
Well, you always have one
in your pocket, right?

525
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:42,451
This one's different.

526
00:34:57,266 --> 00:34:58,679
There are others watching.

527
00:34:58,764 --> 00:34:59,520
Nope.

528
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:00,726
Just us.

529
00:35:02,398 --> 00:35:04,091
No record of this conversation.

530
00:35:04,304 --> 00:35:05,408
Don't need one.

531
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:12,702
Let us get started, okay?

532
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:17,686
Where's that son of a bitch
brother of yours, Osman?

533
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:28,523
Want a smoke?

534
00:35:29,304 --> 00:35:30,013
No.

535
00:35:30,736 --> 00:35:32,254
It is against Allah's wishes.

536
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,256
Yeah, it's against
fire regulations, too.

537
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,050
But if you want one, go ahead.

538
00:35:36,361 --> 00:35:37,263
It's okay.

539
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:50,795
Look at her.

540
00:35:51,786 --> 00:35:53,868
Cigarette burns over
60% of her body.

541
00:35:58,303 --> 00:35:59,752
In unspeakable places.

542
00:36:02,507 --> 00:36:03,452
Look at it!

543
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:05,496
Go on, look at it,
you son of a bitch!

544
00:36:07,321 --> 00:36:08,497
You cannot do this!

545
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:10,664
- Stop, Agent Gibbs!
- I got this, Leon!

546
00:36:10,748 --> 00:36:12,628
You're about to break
16 laws right now!

547
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,672
- He deserves it!
- It doesn't matter!

548
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,456
His brother Osman is dead anyway!

549
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,966
FBI took him down
in a raid about 20 minutes ago.

550
00:36:24,795 --> 00:36:26,941
We went to tell his sister Soraya,
but it was too late.

551
00:36:27,025 --> 00:36:28,718
She'd taken her life already.

552
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,542
She hanged herself in her cell.

553
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,670
They're both gone.

554
00:36:33,797 --> 00:36:35,003
My family is dead.

555
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:37,528
Fight's just begun?

556
00:36:37,927 --> 00:36:40,114
We were going to finish
what my sister had started.

557
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,112
- How?
- A bomb.

558
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:44,450
Electronically detonated.
My creation.

559
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,785
Where?

560
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:52,714
They are not dead.

561
00:36:57,092 --> 00:36:58,258
They are not dead.

562
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,944
Okay, jobs Osman had.

563
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,887
- What'd he have access to?
- He had several occupations.

564
00:37:04,086 --> 00:37:06,882
- Never as a school teacher.
- Mainly as an auto mechanic.

565
00:37:08,815 --> 00:37:09,585
Buses.

566
00:37:09,793 --> 00:37:11,228
Museums and memorials, boss?

567
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,900
I want to know every school
trip scheduled today.

568
00:37:13,984 --> 00:37:15,608
- That's a lot of kids.
- Do it.

569
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:18,312
Park Service isn't showing
anything out of the ordinary.

570
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:20,821
Couple of local junior highs.
Some professional tours.

571
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,160
I have something.

572
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,947
The National Consortium for
Independent Girls' Schools.

573
00:37:25,031 --> 00:37:28,375
300 girls from around
the country at the science museum.

574
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:29,936
That's it. When is it?

575
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,549
- Now.
- Let's go.

576
00:37:33,046 --> 00:37:34,150
Class trip.

577
00:38:21,646 --> 00:38:23,425
Give me the phone, Osman.

578
00:38:28,236 --> 00:38:30,849
Put the gun down,
or I hit the last number.

579
00:38:31,705 --> 00:38:34,046
Ziva, get the kids off the bus,
nice and easy.

580
00:38:34,847 --> 00:38:35,657
On it.

581
00:38:38,303 --> 00:38:39,650
You don't want to do this.

582
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:41,907
It must be done.

583
00:38:43,081 --> 00:38:44,348
Then you'll die, too.

584
00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:48,402
Then I will die
a martyr for the cause.

585
00:38:49,874 --> 00:38:50,703
McGee.

586
00:38:51,475 --> 00:38:52,641
Got it, boss.

587
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:09,390
Signal-jammer, Osman.

588
00:39:10,221 --> 00:39:11,807
That's why your detonator's dead.

589
00:39:20,247 --> 00:39:21,686
You could have killed me.

590
00:39:22,538 --> 00:39:24,271
Coulda, shoulda...

591
00:39:26,272 --> 00:39:27,052
didn't.

592
00:39:28,441 --> 00:39:29,556
You are weak.

593
00:39:34,431 --> 00:39:35,140
No.

594
00:39:36,164 --> 00:39:37,198
Just better.

595
00:39:39,285 --> 00:39:41,039
Cuff him.
Get him out of here.

596
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:43,512
Thank you.

597
00:39:45,775 --> 00:39:47,073
That was the Commandant.

598
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,819
Tell him he still owes me
dinner from 16 years ago.

599
00:39:50,841 --> 00:39:52,431
He called to thank you personally.

600
00:39:54,573 --> 00:39:56,477
Think he called to
thank you personally.

601
00:39:57,349 --> 00:39:58,535
It's protocol.

602
00:40:01,973 --> 00:40:03,574
You wanted to see me, Director?

603
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:05,651
I want you to take some time off.

604
00:40:07,124 --> 00:40:08,113
And do what?

605
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:09,322
I don't know.

606
00:40:09,638 --> 00:40:10,874
Do something fun.

607
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:13,410
Fun?

608
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:15,390
Fun.

609
00:40:15,674 --> 00:40:16,380
Rest.

610
00:40:16,464 --> 00:40:18,096
Recreate. Fish.

611
00:40:18,613 --> 00:40:19,755
Build something.

612
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,001
Whatever you do.

613
00:40:21,826 --> 00:40:23,559
I do this, Leon.

614
00:40:24,996 --> 00:40:26,484
Pass on the vacation.

615
00:40:26,568 --> 00:40:28,467
I am having dinner with
Lieutenant Flores.

616
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,648
She's doing great.

617
00:40:30,368 --> 00:40:31,345
Thanks, anyway.

618
00:40:32,283 --> 00:40:33,246
And, Leon...

619
00:40:35,317 --> 00:40:36,284
this is fun.

620
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,076
Do I really have to do this?

621
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,316
Yes. Just relax, breathe.

622
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,072
- It's hot in here.
- No, it's not.

623
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,117
I'm sweating.
Maybe I'm having a heart attack.

624
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:54,455
My left arm is tingling,
I should go to the infirmary.

625
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:57,184
You'd rather go see
a doctor than do this?

626
00:40:57,486 --> 00:40:59,929
- My God, DiNozzo, you're shaking.
- Of course I'm shaking.

627
00:41:00,013 --> 00:41:02,148
- I'm having a heart attack.
- You're terrified.

628
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,769
Very Special Agent Anthony
DiNozzo doesn't get scared.

629
00:41:11,388 --> 00:41:12,847
I've jumped out of airplanes,

630
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:15,148
dead-dropped onto aircraft carriers,

631
00:41:15,232 --> 00:41:17,338
and I've killed people, sweetheart.
Lots of them.

632
00:41:17,422 --> 00:41:19,853
I've gotten the plague,
kissed a transvestite,

633
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:22,293
and been tortured by the best
the Middle East has to offer.

634
00:41:22,377 --> 00:41:24,262
And, still, you're shaking.

635
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,062
It's time to face my fears.

636
00:41:36,144 --> 00:41:37,327
How bad can it be?

637
00:41:40,149 --> 00:41:41,386
Bring it on, Chaplain.

638
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:04,821
Congratulations, Agent DiNozzo.

639
00:42:04,905 --> 00:42:06,585
Your greatest fear,

640
00:42:06,669 --> 00:42:10,652
is now about to have a snack
of grapes and cheese crackers.

641
00:42:11,186 --> 00:42:12,445
You want to join them?

642
00:43:05,342 --> 00:43:06,933
