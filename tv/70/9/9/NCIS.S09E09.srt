00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,840
NCIS上集回顾
previously on NCIS

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,190
我们要掉下去了!
We're going down!

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,200
Burke牧师
Chaplain Burke.

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,660
我刚调到海军大院的教堂
I just transferred to the chapel here on the Navy Yard.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,280
她的遗体在那架飞机上
Her body was on that plane.

6
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,110
她叫什么名字?
What's her name?

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,080
Gabriela Flores中尉
First Lieutenant Gabriela Flores.

8
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,860
那三口棺材里 只有两位陆战队员
There were only two Marines,and those were three cases.

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,800
而Flores不在其中
And Flores wasn't one of them.

10
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,650
无论任何代价我们都要找到她 带她回来
We will do whatever it takes to find her and bring her home.

11
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,030
陆战队员绝不抛弃队友
No Marine is ever left behind.

12
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,880
Flores是在帮助一所女子学校 重建时遭受突然袭击
Flores was blindsided in an attack on a girls' school she was helping rebuild.

13
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,200
是与她一起共事的人?
It was the people she was working with?

14
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,290
这就是那个老师
That's the teacher.

15
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,090
任何一个在学校工作的人都可能在这照片上
Anyone that worked at that school could be in on this.

16
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,080
那肯定是她
That's gotta be here.

17
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,210
这些是孩子们?!
Are those children?!

18
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,190
她想救他们 却被捉住了
She was trying to save them,and she got caught.

19
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,060
一定要带她回来
Don't come back without her.

20
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,520
来吧 尽管问
Go ahead. Ask

21
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,670
问什么?
Ask what?

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,300
告诉他你在想什么
Tell Him what you're thinking.

23
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:38,210
以我的经验来说 上帝并不好夸夸其谈 他常以行动说明一切
In my experience,He's not a big talker,but His actions speak volumes.

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,730
他的行为令人质疑
His actions have been questionable.

25
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:48,590
你的女儿Gabriela想要拯救那些孩子
Your daughter,Gabriela,tried to save those kids.

26
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,520
她的一生都效忠于国家
She dedicated her life to serving her country.

27
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,130
如果这是上帝的某种旨意 我并不苟同
If she's any indication of His actions,then I have to disagree.

28
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,810
她那晚应该回大本营
She should have gone back to base that night.

29
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,750
她应该服从指令
She should have followed orders.

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,770
没错
Yes.

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,310
但或许是出于本能
But by following her instincts,

32
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,330
或许是她选择听从上帝的指令
maybe she was following His orders instead.

33
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,260
Gibbs能带她回来吗?
Can Gibbs bring her back?

34
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,160
我认识Gibbs探员的时间并不长
Well,look,I haven't known Special Agent Gibbs for very long,

35
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,840
但他是一个好人 他的队员也是百里挑一
but he's a good man and he's working with the best.

36
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,700
所以我坚信他们会尽一切所能带她回家
So I have faith they they will do everything they can to find her.

37
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,600
我知道他们会找到她的 牧师
I know they'll find her,Chaplain.

38
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,910
问题是 她会活着回来吗?
The question is will she be alive?

39
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,190
DiNozzo探员 怎么样了?
Agent DiNozzo,what is it?

40
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,000
<font color=#B1D20E>海军罪案调查处 第九季 第09集 </font>
 

41
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,020
阿富汗 Helmand省
helmand province afghanistan

42
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,340
48小时前
48 hours earlier

43
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,430
队长
Captain.

44
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,870
Gibbs探员
Special Agent Gibbs.

45
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,660
欢迎来到野兽之腹
Welcome to the belly of the beast.

46
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,790
一路顺利?
Smooth ride?

47
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,550
直到有人朝我们开枪之前
Till somebody started shooting at us.

48
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,210
那是喀布尔的欢迎方式
It's Kabul's welcome wagon.

49
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,490
下回还是烤点饼干啥的吧
Next time,bake cookies.

50
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,680
什么情况?
What's the status?

51
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,640
一些当地人说了实话
Got some locals to change their story.

52
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,510
他们证实 Flores中尉和两个女孩被擒
And they confirm Lieutenant Flores and the two girls were taken.

53
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,240
他们有交待出那些暴民们?
Did they identify the insurgents?

54
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,580
说实话是一方面 可要是供出名字就会招来灭口
Changing their story is one thing,but giving up names gets folks killed.

55
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,940
百姓不敢讲真话
People are afraid to talk.

56
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,630
那为什么没有处决Flores?
So why keep Flores alive?

57
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,660
信息
Information.

58
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,120
激进分子不喜欢西方人让他们 的孩子开拓眼界
Radicals don't like Westerners opening up their kids' eyes.

59
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,740
去年整个中东地区有167学校遭袭
167 schools were hit last year throughout the Middle East.

60
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,750
其中的一多半都在阿富汗
More than half were in Afghanistan alone.

61
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,530
作为一名女性接触部队的成员 Flores知道新学校建在哪里
And as a FET,Flores knows where new ones are being built.

62
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,600
接触部队的作用就是在 部族和军队中起对话作用
FETs act as a conduit between the locals and the Corps.

63
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,850
我会向你们介绍勤务兵Littleton
I'll introduce you to Staff Sergeant Littleton.

64
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,060
她当晚也在场
She was there that night.

65
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,040
学校是他们行动中必不可少的一环
Schools can be a big part of what they do.

66
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,990
好消息是Flores救出的那两个女孩 在以南七点方向被发现
Good news is the two girls that Flores saved were just found about seven clicks due south.

67
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,450
被人遗弃在路边 她们正在被运往这里救治的途中
Abandoned roadside.They're being transported here for treatment.

68
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,520
她们一切还好?
Are they all right?

69
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,430
脱水 受到惊吓 明显遭到折磨
Dehydrated,scared,clearly tortured.

70
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,710
但是保住了命
But alive.

71
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,700
我们需要见她们
We'll need to see them.

72
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,090
只要你对将看到的一切有心理准备
As long as you're prepared for what you'll see.

73
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,230
我在这片区域长大
I grew up in this region.

74
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,690
看上去你没受多大影响
Looks like you turned out okay.

75
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,520
我有自己的立场
I can hold my own.

76
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,370
收到
Copy that.

77
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,100
勤务兵Littleton吗
Staff Sergeant Littleton.

78
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,840
Gibbs探员
Special Agent Gibbs.

79
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,120
执行官说您想见我
C.O. said you wanted to see me?

80
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,880
没错 坐下谈
Yeah.Sit down.

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,770
我听说学校遇袭当晚 你和Flores中尉在一起
Understand that you were with Lieutenant Flores the night the school was attacked.

82
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,590
我已经告诉过调查组了 先生
I already gave a statement to the Investigative Unit,sir.

83
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,630
我知道 但我刚来 急于听到一切
Yeah,I know,but I just got here and I'm anxious to hear.

84
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,570
没什么特别的
There's nothing really different to say.

85
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,670
只是想弄清楚一些
Just trying to get a clear picture.

86
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,960
好 先生
Yes,sir.

87
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,570
我们很多人在开火之前被疏散了出来
A bunch of us evacuated before all hell broke loose.

88
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,740
我觉得我们所有人都上了车
I thought we were all together in a seven-ton.

89
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,260
我一直在喊她的名字 可她没有应我
I kept yelling her name,but she didn't answer.

90
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,010
她没有回应我
She couldn't answer.

91
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,810
如果我和Gabby呆在一起 或许她就不会身处险境
If I'd have stayed with Gabby,she might not be in this mess.

92
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,010
或许你也会丧命
Or you might be dead.

93
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,000
认识这女的吗?
Know that woman?

94
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,660
Soraya?
Soraya?

95
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,720
她是幸运儿之一
She's one of the fortunate ones.

96
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,430
幸运儿? 怎么幸运?
Fortunate?How?

97
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,150
她当天没在学校
She wasn't at school that day.

98
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,980
她去喀布尔郊外探访家人
She was seeing her family outside Kabul.

99
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,340
那之后你见过她吗?
Have you seen her since?

100
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,620
没有 先生
No,sir.

101
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:42,700
我们猜想她利用做老师的身份 来刺探袭击的最佳时间
We think that she used being a teacher to know when to strike.

102
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,720
孩子们相信Soraya
The kids trusted Soraya.

103
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,800
我们也是
We all did.

104
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,280
她利用了这种信任
She took advantage of that trust.

105
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,750
而且成功做到了 先生
And she succeeded,sir.

106
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,650
她是个懦夫
At being a coward.

107
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,580
现在该我们出手了
Now it's our turn.

108
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,090
我们可能觉得每个人都应学会读和写
While we may believe that everyoneshould be taught to read and write,

109
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,790
可在中东还有人不这么认为
there are still some in the Middle East who do not see it that way.

110
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,380
从另一方面看 十字军东征时
Yeah,but on the other hand, back in the Crusades,

111
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,420
圣殿骑士是为了他们所敬畏的信仰 而大开杀戮
the Knights Templar, they were willing to kill for what they held sacred.

112
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,320
可悲的是 在这两个例子里 无辜的孩子们却都受到了伤害
Tragically, in both instances, innocent children suffer.

113
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,310
年轻人的战争
A battle for young hearts and minds.

114
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,830
Flores中尉发现自己处于战场中
And Lieutenant Flores found heelf at the very center of that battle.

115
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,750
瞧瞧你俩-几小时后就称兄道弟了
Look at you two- hitting Wong's after hours

116
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,310
像大学情侣似地整夜聊天
and talking the night away like a couple of college coeds.

117
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,430
我觉得Burke中校提出的观点非常...
Commander Burke offers a perspective I find quite...

118
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,460
令人兴奋
provocative.

119
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,480
我猜也是这样 Ducky
I bet you do,Ducky.

120
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,120
好了 我们也有点累了 在等回应
Anyway,we're tired and waiting for answers.

121
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,110
是国家安全局
That was Homeland Security.

122
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:56,240
Jaysh El-Mo'mineen和也门 沙特阿拉伯以及菲律宾的恐怖组织有联系
The Jaysh El-Mo'mineen have links to terror cells in Yemen,Saudi Arabia and the Philippines.

123
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,380
下一步怎么做?
What's the next step?

124
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,360
我们得把其中一个组织变成 我们的激进分子
Well,we need one of those cells to turn on our radicals.

125
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,870
他们之间越不信任 我们就越能瓦解他们
The less that they trust each other, the more we can destabilize them.

126
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,210
你有什么收获 Tony?
What about you,Tony?

127
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,550
我?
Me?

128
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,070
希望你不是浪费时间在他的 那个"人生必做清单"上 我都听烦了
I hope you're not wasting your time on that bucket list I keep hearing about.

129
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,620
那个不是浪费时间...
It's not a waste of time...

130
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,400
你有点缺少信仰哦
O ye of little faith.

131
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,530
现在在场的人当然没有啦
Present company excluded, of course.

132
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,710
是 我是在做"人生必做清单"
Yeah,I am working on bucket list.

133
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:25,520
也许天天讨论恐怖主义 让我产生了某种不安全感
Perhaps all this talk of terrorism has me anxious about certain insecurities.

134
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,040
你吗 DiNozzo?
You,DiNozzo?

135
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,140
是的 我
Yes,me.

136
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:38,850
我知道-会有点吃惊-但是在我三尺男儿 的身躯里 住着一个容易受伤的梦想家
I know- shocking- but beneath this incredibly masculine body armor, there is a vulnerable do-gooder.

137

Ziva 我们需要取样
Ziva,we need a sample.

276
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,750
然后你给她们任何她们想要的东西

277
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,100
你们永远不要停止微笑 好吗?

278
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,830
Abby 你分析过样本了吗?

How can I whine about the cost of my DVD-by-mail service

281
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,750
当世界上还有地方真正充满了问题
when there's real problems in this world Well,

282
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,010
你能那么想就好了
when you put it that way.

283
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,610
就像拿这个证据作例子
Like,take this evidence,for example.

284
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,960
通常我会抱怨不能检测真正的样本
Normally,I uld whine about not being able to examine the actual item.

285
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,620
但基于我们离阿富汗有4000英里远
But given that we are 4,000 miles from Afghanistan,

286
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,730
我们必须在当地的海军基地 里面做基本化学分解
we have to settle for a basic chemical breakdown from the Marine unit.

287
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,040
我采用了他们的分析 然后做了加工
And I took their breakdown and I made lemonade.

288
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,830
谁知道地理化学会那么酷呢?

就像植物生命的化学成分 在任何地区都是独一无二的
Just like the chemical compositions of plant life are unique to any given area,

292
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,920
天然原油的成分就如同地理指纹
crude oil deposits are like a geographic fingerprint.

293
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:51,020
这是阿富汗喀布尔的外面 阿富汗的油管线路
This is from outside Kabul,Afghanistan,on the Afghan pipeline.

294
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,040
发现那些女孩的地方没有石油 所以...
There was no oil where the girls were found,so...

295
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,310
所以应该是他们被关押的地方
So it's probably where they were being held captive.

296
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,740
也是Flores中尉可能还在的地方
And where Lieutenant Flores still might be.

当然 我理解 你是个大忙人
Of course,I understand You're a busy guy.

306
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,140
我们没怎么交流过
We haven't talked much.

307
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,120
都是我不好
That's my bad.

308
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,350
我在人间已经尽力了

316

或者告诉我不是在自言自语?
How about You let me know I'm not talking to myself?

317
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,920
如你预见的
You are so predictable.

318
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,050
我想我们的问题是没法交流
Well,I guess what we have here is a failure to communicate.

长官 那不是我能决定的

407
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,860
没错 但你想过 对吗?
Yeah,but you've thought about it,right?

408
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,580
她应该为她所犯下的罪行付出代价
She should be held accountable for her crimes.

409
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:18,040

这是恩赐 长官
That's a gift,sir.

412
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,310
惩罚只会让她重蹈覆辙
Punishment is knowing she could have done the same.

413
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,100
你真与众不同 Flores
You're rare,Flores.

415
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,180
什么事? - 没啥
- what?- Nothing.

416
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,710
不对 肯定有鬼 什么事?
Oh,no.Definitely something.What?

417
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,500
你激起了我的好奇心
You intrigue me.

418
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,820
为什么?
Why?

419
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,080
当有东西破碎 我总想修补
When something's broken,I want to fix it.

420
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,500
我不想跟你掏心掏肺 牧师 没那个金刚钻 就别揽瓷器活
Well,I hate to break it to you,Chaplain,but you ain't got enough tools in your woodshed.

421
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,790
哦 你也许会吃惊的
Oh,you might be surprised.

422
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,610
那么你为什么对我好奇? 因为我像天主女校的捣蛋鬼
So how do I intrigue you?In a naughty Catholic schoolgirl kind of way or

423
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:19,050
还是因为我需要所谓的"精神辅导"?
because I'm in need of what your kind calls "spiritual guidance"?

424
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,000
呃 幸运的是 后者
Well,lucky for me,the latter.

425
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,430
那你不需要为我担心
Well,you don't have to worry about me.

426
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,320
我的精神世界坚不可摧
I am rock solid in the spirit department.

427
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,480
嗯 那真是太有意思了
Mm,that's fascinating.

428
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,150
你知道更有意思的是什么吗?
You know what's even more fascinating?

429
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,660
不知道 是啥?
No,what's that?

430
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,940
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

431
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:41,000
当你准备好去面对那种恐惧 DiNozzo探员 我会和你一起面对
When you're ready to face that fear,Agent DiNozzo,I'm ready to face it with you.

432
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,080
你知道 我...
You know,I...

433
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,040
我只是想救她们
I was just trying to save them.

434
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,300
你做到了
And you did.

435
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,970
躺在那棺材里的应该是我
Should've been me in that box.

436
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,180
不 中尉
No,Lieutenant.

437
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,290
躺在那里面的也不该是Quincy上校
And it should not have been Captain Quincy either.

438
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,530
出什么事了?
What's going on?

439
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,830
说了啥?
What's it say?

440
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,690
直升机坠毁 六名陆战队员牺牲
Helo went down.Lost six Marines.

441
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,960
在哪里? - 日本冲绳岛

442
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,600
他们刚到达那里 真不幸
Poor bastards just got there.

443
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,490
我看那个叫Matteson的女兵也在其中
I think that Matteson girl was one of them.

444
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,900
我其实根本没真正和她说过话 不过她三次打破我的训练记录
I never actually talked to her,but she beat three of my course times.

445
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,440
她很棒 比运动员还猛
She was good.Hell of an athlete.

446
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,740
Gibbs 你记得Matteson吧
Gibbs,you remember Matteson.

欢迎来到我的教室
Welcome to my classroom.

450
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,960
为什么我会在这儿?
Why am I here?

451
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,830
我认为我们可以先谈谈 而不是直接送你去关塔那摩
Instead of a direct flight to Gitmo,I thought we could talk.

452
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:30,090
来个家庭团圆
Have a family reunion.

453
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,080
我没什么可说的
I have nothing to say.

454
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,460
你们两个上次见面是什么时候?
When was the last time you saw each other?

455
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,310
别说 我来猜猜

456
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,490
在托莱多参加恐怖分子大会?
Terrorist convention in Toledo?

457
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:45,610
随便你怎么嘲笑我 Gibbs探员 你永远也不会明白我们的动机
Mock me all you want,Agent Gibbs,you will never understand our motivation.

458
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,850
你骗取这些孩子的信任 然后伤害他们
You gained the trust of these kids,and then you hurt 'em.

459
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:54,930
教那些孩子们不要被你们的谎言所迷惑?
By teaching future generations not to be influenced by your histrionic lies?

460
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,850
在这个国家 孩子受教育是基本权利
In this country,teaching children is a privilege.

461
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,870
在这个国家 你们浪费金钱 把孩子送入大学去享乐
In this country,you waste money sending your kids to college to have fun.

462
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,940
他们学会如何独立思考
They're taught to think on their own.

463
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,860
他们有钱 是被宠坏的小屁孩
They are rich,spoiled brats.

464
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,700
你就是用这种方式来报复吗?
This is how you answer that?

465
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,530
你们这些激进派 残害杀害无辜儿童
You're radicals who maim and kill innocent children

466
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,780
就因为他们想学会他人的思考方式
because they want to learn how other people think?!

467
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,250
你以为我们是为自己这样做吗?
You think we do this for ourselves?!

468
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:25,490
你们来到我们的村庄和城市 带着那令人厌恶的西方思想
You come into our villages and towns with your disgusting Western ideals.

469
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:29,240
教唆我们的孩子质疑他们的传统
You teach our children to question their heritage,

470
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,150
让他们依赖于网络 抛弃古兰经
to rely on the Internet instead of the Koran.

471
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,180
是的 我们就要这样报复
Yes,this is our answer.

472
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,880
这就是唯一的答案
It is the only answer.

473
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,720
你等着看吧
And you will see.

474
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,370
我看着呢
I'll see.

475
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,150
我看什么?
I'll see what?

00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,600

481
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,470
根据我们的档案 他已经死了
According to our file,he's dead.

482
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,580
你以为我们的战斗结束了
Well... You think our fight is over.

483
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:08,320
但...其实才刚刚开始
But... it has just begun.

484

嗨 特种部队回来鸟
Hey,look what the Corps sent back.

485
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,330
旅途艰难 Ziva?
Rough trip,Ziva?

486
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:32,140
艰难太轻描淡写了 McGee

是"出"
The rub.

491
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,200
问题就出在这里 固定用法
