1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,700
Good God almighty, get me out of here!

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,500
My head is about to explode.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,200
That was the longest three hours of my entire frickin' life.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,000
<i>Well, you're the one that said no to the muzzle, Tony.</i>

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,600
I wanted to shut his pothole two hours ago.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,800
It's "pie hole."

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,500
And by the way, we went to the Arby's drive-thru.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,300
No such thing as a ride-thru.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,400
How long have you lived here anyway?
Man, get off me!

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,900
I'll pay you to take him upstairs.
Just name your price.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
My rock beat your scissors.
Besides, I've got $5 million in heroin.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,200
It's nothing.

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,600
Really?

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,900
I have a feeling your South African suppliers won't feel the same way.

15
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,100
Yeah, considering how much money you owe them,
you should be thankful you're in our custody.

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,300
-We're your new best friends.
-I don't care what you do to me. I'm not talking!

17
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,800
I find that really hard to believe.

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,200
All yours, Agent David.

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,300
-Come on, man.
-Yeah?

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,900
Yeah, take off the cuffs!

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,500
Yeah, what's his problem, huh?

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,200
You. You're insulting, you're crude and most of all you are extremely annoying.

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,900
I'm annoying?
He's the one rambling on and on about Top Gun.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,900
Giving me a freakin' migraine

25
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,300
I didn't realize I had to sit in silence the entire trip.

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,000
-The last time I checked, the First Amendment guarantees...
-Enough!

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,400
-Get in.
-No.

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,100
He's dead.

29
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,000
I've been traveling to crime scenes for a great many years,

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,800
but I can say with complete confidence

31
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,700
this is the shortest commute I have ever had.

32
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,000
And one of the first times I didn't get us lost.

33
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,100
True.

34
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,800
<i>All yours, Duck.</i>

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,900
<i>I sure appreciate all the help, Tony.</i>

36
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,800
It's a nice outfit, probie.

37
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,900
Okay, the handbook says that we are required

38
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,900
to wear this outfit at all active crime scenes.
You know that.

39
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,500
Yeah, but not in our own building.

40
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,400
That's like wearing a name tag in your own apartment.

41
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,700
Tony...

42
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,700
come here.

43
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,000
How's she holding up?

44
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, I, uh, I don't know.

45
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,400
-I haven't talked to her yet.
-May I ask why?

46
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,600
'Cause I told him not to, Ducky.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,200
Excuse me.

48
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Right now, she's a suspect, not an investigator.

49
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,800
Boss, you don't think Ziva's really capable of this, do you?

50
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
Well, I mean, she's capable of it,

51
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,600
but you don't really think that she would just...

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,300
Kill someone?

53
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,600
Not without a good reason.

54
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,700
Look, we all know Ziva has crazy ninja skills,

55
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,300
but I mean she's got some self-control, right?

56
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,200
Not a lot, some.

57
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,600
Never mind.

58
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,900
Forgive me for overstepping, Jethro,

59
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,800
but you and I both know that this

60
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,600
is far beyond Officer David's character.

61
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,100
Not me or you I'm worried about right now, Duck.

62
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,900
We have a cause of death?

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
At this point, I'd only be speculating

64
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,700
We won't know anything specific till I get him back...

65
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,900
Well, downstairs, I suppose.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,100
No bruising?

67
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah, well, the only injury I've been able to find

68
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,400
is this on the top  of his head here.

69
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,700
Oh, come here.

70
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,700
-Ow!
-Ow!

71
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,700
I'll zig,

72
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,500
you zag.

73
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,600
Here, allow me.

74
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,000
Looks recent.

75
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,100
Yeah, well, based on its location, it appears

76
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,000
that he...

77
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,200
struck his head on one of these rails when he fell.

78
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,000
Oh, come on, Jethro.

79
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,700
I mean, there's no sign of any physical altercation.

80
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,200
Duck, with her training, there wouldn't be.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,900
Hey.

82
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,400
-You ready to hear my side of the story?
-We're not gonna get a chance to hear his.

83
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,900
I didn't touch him.

84
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,600
Hardly at all.

85
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,400
When the elevtor doors opened, he refused to get in.

86
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,200
Had this would have been a year ago,
I would have snapped his little neck, but it's not and I didn't.

87
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,700
I asked him several times to step into the elevator.

88
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,100
He wouldn't cooperate.

89
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,900
And that's when I struck him.

90
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,000
How?

91
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,900
With my fist.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,700
-Where?
-In the jugular.

93
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,000
Can you guys believe I'm about to go to my first crime scene?

94
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,700
It's not a good time.

95
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,200
It was just a little love tap.

96
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,300
Choked him up for a couple seconds, that's all.

97
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,300
Look, I know this looks bad.

98
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,000
I also know with Brian Dempsey dead

99
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,500
it's nearly impossible to bring down

100
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,400
his South African distributors, much less prosecute his brother.

101
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,800
It's not our biggest problem here, Ziva.

102
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,300
It appears there's only one way to fix this.

103
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,500
I've seen it in your American movies.

104
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,100
This is where I resign.

105
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,800
The next time you hand me your badge,

106
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,400
you had better be prepared to lose it.

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,900
Wow.

108
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,700
After all these years I'm finally losing my crime-scene virginity.

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,200
Wow, I don't think that's ever been said before.

110
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,900
Aw.

111
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,300
I think we've got enough crime scene pictures.

112
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,900
Sorry, McGee. I just...

113
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,500
Maybe your hat is turning me into some sort of super agent.

114
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,800
<i>That's weird 'cause it never had that effect on McGee.</i>

115
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,200
Why do I feel like everyone's staring at me?

116
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,600
Because they are.

117
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,300
Did I do something wrong?

118
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Have you ever been to Disneyland, Abby?

119
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,600
Every summer.

120
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah. You know those camera-toting tourists

121
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,800
with the tall white socks up to their knees wearing fanny packs?

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,500
Well, yeah, we spend half the time laughing about...

123
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,100
Uh, yeah.

124
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,500
Oh, my God.

125
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,900
I've turned into my Uncle Larry.

126
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,500
<i>This man doesn't look a day over 30, Doctor.</i>

127
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,400
According to his arrest report...

128
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,100
he would have been 25 next month.

129
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,800
So assuming Ziva didn't kill him, that means he just dropped dead?

130
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,500
It would appear that way, wouldn't it?

131
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,300
He's so young.

132
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,200
As my father used to say,

133
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,400
"You must live for today

134
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,200
"'cause yesterday is gone...

135
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,900
and tomorrow may never come."

136
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,100
That's really beautiful, Doctor.

137
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,800
Yes, unfortunately, he never practiced what he preached.

138
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,400
He was always a bit of a penny-pincher.

139
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,500
A Papa Scrooge, if you like.

140
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,400
That was one reason that he and my mother

141
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,200
went their separate ways.

142
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah, most people don't know this, but

143
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,000
financial disputes, second-leading cause of divorce.

144
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,700
Really? What's number one?

145
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,000
Marriage.

146
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,200
Actually, I'm pretty sure it's infidelity-- see, the study I ready said that...

147
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,700
Never mind.

148
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,200
I understand your sense of urgency, Jethro,

149
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,500
but my examination is still underway.

150
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,200
Just tell me what you know, Duck.

151
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,000
Well, so far I've found no life-threatening abnormalities.

152
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,200
What about his throat?

153
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,800
Well, we did,

154
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,500
in our internal examination, find

155
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,900
a slight irritation of the anterior jugular.

156
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,500
Perhaps caused by a...

157
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,300
physcial blow.

158
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Mm-hmm.

159
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,600
Was the blow fatal?

160
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,200
It didn't appear to be.

161
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,100
Look, I won't know the cause of this man's death

162
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,500
until I've completed my work.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,800
MRIs, Abby's tox screen, they're all forthcoming.

164
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,700
Look, I know what you want to hear, Jethro,

165
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,500
but Officer David is not off the hook yet.

166
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,300
Hey, will you stop doing that?

167
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,700
You're making me nervous.

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,500
How long can it possibly take?

169
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,900
Well, I don't know, Ziva, it's an autopsy, not an oil change.

170
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,600
You know what? I don't think we're supposed to be talking about the case with her.

171
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,800
It's a simple conversation, you know.

172
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,200
"What do you have, Ducky?"

173
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,000
"Well, Jethro, this reminds me of a time

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,100
back at Scotland Yard when I..."

175
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,000
"To the point, Ducky."

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
"Well, based on my preliminary findings, Ziva did not kill this man."

177
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,200
What?

178
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,800
What?

179
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
So?

180
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,100
Did you talk to Ducky?

181
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,100
Yeah.

182
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,300
And?

183
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,300
And now I have to go talk to the Director.

184
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,700
Oh, maybe she really did kill that guy.

185
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,600
Hey, Gibbs, what did Ducky say?

186
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Gibbs?

187
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,000
Hey, are you going to tell me anything or not?

188
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,200
There's nothing to tell yet, Ziva.

189
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,000
Stan, it's Cynthia again.

190
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,800
I'm really starting to get worried.

191
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,900
Please call me as soon as you get this.

192
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,600
She in?

193
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
Still not back from lunch.

194
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,700
And he's been waiting for half an hour.

195
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,100
He'll survive.

196
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,600
It's not like her, Agent Gibbs.

197
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,500
She's never been late for a meeting.

198
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,500
You try her driver?

199
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,700
Stan's not answering his cell or pager.

200
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,500
I've left him four messages.

201
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,000
I really don't know what else to do.

202
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,400
I've been calling her cell...

203
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,600
-Agent Gibbs.
-Director.

204
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,900
Got a major problem here.

205
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,100
Sorry to hear that, Jethro.

206
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
I have quite a serious problem myself.

207
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,400
I'm pretty sure you're going to want to hear mine first.

208
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm not entirely sure that's true.

209
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,800
You really should be listening to her problem, Jethro.

210
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,200
You're holding my heroin and my little brother.

211
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,700
If I don't get both back in two hours, she dies.

212
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,800
I'll call back with the details.

213
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,000
She called in at 11:45

214
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,000
when she arrived at the Whitmore Hotel.

215
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,800
According to the Senator's assistant, lunch was over at 12:50.

216
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,700
Ten minutes ahead of schedule.

217
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,300
She never checked in again.

218
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,900
I need to see her itinerary.

219
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,200
I can't do that, Agent Gibbs.

220
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,500
I'm not trying to be difficult,

221
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
but the Director's been very clear.

222
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,100
Her schedule is confidential,

223
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,700
even to you.
-Are you done?

224
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Director Shepard has been kidnapped.

225
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,000
I need to know where she was when it happened.

226
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Okay.

227
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,200
Here's everything.

228
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,900
9:00 a.m., the G-A-O,

229
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,000
10:30 with the A-T-C-C.

230
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,100
And after lunch a meeting with the B-O-B.

231
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,000
Uh, that Congressman Bob Sommers.

232
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
He's a friend.

233
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,700
It doesn't say where she's meeting him.

234
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,300
I'm not sure.

235
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,200
He has the car wait at the hotel, gets coffee nearby.

236
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,100
You think Bob's involved?

237
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,500
No, but it will give me a search radius.

238
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,000
Give me a copy of this, will you?

239
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,200
What else can I do?

240
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,400
Keep quiet.

241
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,900
She's going to be okay, right?

242
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,300
If you have a question, ask it.

243
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm afraid you'll put the Vulcan death grip on me.

244
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,700
I'm considering it.

245
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,000
Where'd you learn to do that, anyway?

246
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,200
Years of training on a secluded desert island?

247
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,800
Blind Master Po always one step ahead of you.

248
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,000
When you take the pebble from my hand...

249
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,700
then it will be time...

250
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,500
Oh, do that again.

251
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,800
Show me...

252
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,000
-DiNozzo.
-Yeah, boss. I was just...

253
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,300
Shut up.

254
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,600
Get over here.

255
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,400
James Dempsey has taken Director Shepard hostage.

256
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,800
He wants his drugs and his brother back or she dies.

257
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,300
We have two hours.

258
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,500
Last contact was at the Whitmore Hotel.

259
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,500
-Driver's not responding. DiNozzo...
-On it.

260
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,100
Dempsey used the Director's cell phone.

261
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,500
I'll start a trace.

262
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,100
What about me?

263
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,200
This is the Director's schedule.

264
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,700
Start making calls.

265
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,600
Desk work?

266
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,700
-Put me in the field.
-No, not happening.

267
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,300
You need me out there.

268
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,500
Not happening.

269
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,000
I need you at your desk making calls. Go.

270
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,400
Hey, clock's ticking, people.

271
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,000
Jenny can take care of herself, Gibbs.

272
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,100
She was a good agent.

273
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,400
She still is.

274
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,500
I've been investigating James Dempsey for nine months, Gibbs.

275
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,300
Seems like a frat boy on the surface, but the guy's brutal.

276
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
We've linked him to half a dozen unsolved homicides.

277
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,200
But still...

278
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,300
kidnapping the director of NCIS takes guts I didn't know he had.

279
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,100
He's going to kill her, Cassie. Nothing to be impressed by.

280
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,600
I'm not impressed, I'm worried.

281
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,600
Any intel from those squids you busted?

282
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
They're just mules.

283
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,800
Moving product for the South Africans.
Didn't even know who they were working for.

284
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,900
Get down here.

285
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,200
Be there in a couple hours.

286
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,300
Hold on.

287
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Base commander's got a chopper waiting.

288
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,100
The only thing James Dempsey loves more than money is his baby brother.

289
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,300
As long as you have Brian in custody, James should be easy to manipulate.

290
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,300
Brian Dempsey's dead.

291
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,000
You still think he'll be easy to manipulate, Cassie?

292
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,400
I'm on my way.

293
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,600
<i>This is totally disturbing.</i>

294
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,900
Yes, it is.

295
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,900
Who would treat their feet like that?

296
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,500
-Feet?
-Yeah, look at these soles.

297
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,300
Do you know what that does to somebody's arches?

298
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,000
Heel spurs, torn ligaments, not to mention the effect on spinal alignment.

299
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,600
-Abby, he was a drug dealer.
-McGee, there is no excuse for poor foot care.

300
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,200
-You wear platforms.
-And I'm trying to work here.

301
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,400
Are you still tracking the Director's cell phone?

302
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,600
No, I tracked it.

303
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,500
To half a dozen different cell towers.

304
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,600
He called from a car.

305
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,100
Driving down the 395.

306
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,500
Were there any other calls?

307
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,000
Phone was turned off.
Probably tossed it.

308
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,400
We pinpointed the GPS to its last location.

309
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,800
Great.

310
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,500
Not great?

311
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,300
It's a major interchange.
He could have taken any of four highways out of there.

312
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,800
So much for plan "A."

313
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,600
-Better have a plan "B."
-Gibbs!

314
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,300
Are you okay?

315
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,800
I was really worried about you because of the Director and all.
I know that you guys are really

316
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,900
close. Plan "B." I am running samples on Brian Dempsey's clothing

317
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,800
and personal effects to "Sherlock" where he's been hanging out.

318
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,500
-And?
-And it's going to take some time.

319
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,300
Which we don't have, so I'll hurry up now.

320
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,800
I'm working a different angle.

321
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,900
Collecting Brian Dempsey's credit cards and phone records.

322
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,100
By creating a simple algorithm using his personal data,

323
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,900
I've constructed a computer model

324
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,600
of his buying patterns juxtaposed with his calling patterns.

325
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,700
I don't care.
Get it done.

326
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,100
Get out.

327
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,400
Easy there, Rudd.

328
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,700
She's not one of your dates.

329
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,300
She wouldn't even be here if your idiot brother didn't get caught.

330
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,500
Got to apologize for Alex.

331
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,300
He takes some getting used to.

332
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,200
But once you get to know him, you'll really learn to hate him.

333
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,700
On your knees.

334
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,700
Please.

335
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,800
You're wasting your time.

336
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,900
I'm just trying to make you more comfortable.

337
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
I meant taking me hostage.

338
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,100
They're never going to negotiate.

339
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,900
Well, don't sell yourself so short.

340
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,300
They're not allowed to.

341
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
I don't know.

342
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,400
Agent Gibbs seems fond of you.

343
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,300
Maybe he'll make an exception.

344
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,900
Gibbs thinks of me like a wife.

345
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,700
See?

346
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,900
He's had three.

347
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,900
We busted your brother with $5 million in pure heroin.

348
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,900
You think the Navy's just going to give him back?

349
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,500
Stand up.

350
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,700
Now.

351
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,800
On the chair.

352
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,100
Lean back.

353
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,100
I'm sorry about this.

354
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,000
My brother's always had a way of getting us in trouble.

355
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,100
I'm the one who bails us out.

356
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,200
You didn't break someone's window with a baseball.

357
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,000
You kidnapped the head of a federal agency.

358
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,300
Yeah.

359
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,900
You got a point.

360
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,600
But look on the bright side.

361
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,000
This will be over soon.

362
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,100
One way or the other.

363
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,300
Stanley.

364
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Excuse me?

365
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,900
-My driver.
-He's fine.

366
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,600
He might be a little uncomfortable.

367
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,700
Stuck him in the trunk of your car.

368
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,600
See, I'm not a bad guy.

369
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,700
I just want the drugs you stole from me and my brother back.

370
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,000
Yes, I know it's confidential information,

371
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,900
but please don't put me on hold...
<i>-Hold please.</i>

372
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,900
You all right?

373
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,600
I'm doing desk work.

374
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,000
Could be worse.

375
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,100
What part of "desk work" don't you understand?

376
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,500
<i>Agent David, are you there?</i>

377
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,900
-Yes, hello. Hello, yes. All I want is... No, no ,don't...
<i>Hold please.-</i>

378
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,100
I know what you're going through.

379
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,900
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

380
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,100
Are you making pointless phone calls and following up dead leads?

381
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,100
That's not what I mean.

382
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,800
When I shot that cop...

383
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,100
I felt like everyone doubted me.

384
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,700
But after awhile...

385
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,400
Are you trying to make me feel better?

386
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,100
Is it not working?

387
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,900
It's not necessary, McGee.

388
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Our only concern should be the Director.

389
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,000
You're right.

390
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,500
Agent David, Master Sergeant Clayton will be with you...

391
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,300
You put me on hold again, and I will jump

392
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,900
through this phone and I will strangle you.

393
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,900
<i>Hold please.</i>

394
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,800
Hey, McGee.

395
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,600
Nobody ever doubted you.

396
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,200
Just like those calls you're making aren't pointless.

397
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,000
We're looking for a black town car.

398
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,000
You're gonna have to be a little more specific.

399
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,000
It's got federal plates.

400
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,100
You just described half our clientele.

401
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,800
Look, the car belongs to the Director of NCIS.

402
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,100
It comes with a driver. She's here twice a week.

403
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,400
Director Shepard?

404
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,500
-Yeah.
-Why didn't you say so?

405
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,400
I was trying to be discreet.

406
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,600
Is she all right?

407
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,200
She's just peachy.

408
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,900
She just left her keys in her car.

409
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Here we are.

410
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,300
Looks like the door's open.

411
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,700
Hold on.

412
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,700
Is this a a crime scene, Agent DiNozzo?

413
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,900
It is now.

414
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,800
<i>The Director's driver was taken by surprise</i>

415
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,400
<i>then shot in the back of the head.</i>

416
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,200
Dempsey then kidnapped the Director

417
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,100
and is demanding the return of his drugs,

418
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,400
his brother...

419
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,100
or she dies.

420
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,500
Let's hope we find her before that happens, Officer David.

421
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,500
Here's everything I got on the Dempseys, Gibbs.

422
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,800
Nine months of surveillance, wiretaps, buy-busts.

423
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Uh, where do I sit?

424
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,600
Any of this going to help me find the Director?

425
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,900
Probably not.

426
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,200
Wish I could tell you I had someone inside his organization.

427
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,800
You never flipped an informer?

428
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,400
I was hoping to flip his brother.
Obviously that's never going to happen.

429
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,000
Officer David.

430
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,200
<i>-Uploading the security feed now.</i>
-Got it, Tony.</i>

431
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,700
Tony's uploading the Whitmore Hotel security footage right now.

432
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,400
He's got Dempsey leaving the garage.

433
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,500
<i>Dempsey's had less than a day to target the Director.</i>

434
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,400
He'll have been sloppy, left a trail.

435
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,200
James Dempsey's in the passenger seat.

436
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,500
The Director must be in the back.

437
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Who's driving?

438
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,200
Alex Rudd.

439
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,900
Point man for the cartels running drugs through South Africa.

440
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,500
The guy's a serious psychopath, Gibbs. I...

441
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,800
didn't know he was in the country.

442
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,600
But I know 50 places he likes to hang out.

443
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,600
-I'll start knocking down doors.
-No, I need you here. Get somebody else to do it.

444
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,200
-I'll start doing some...
-No, you're not going anywhere.

445
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,300
You sit down Run a BOLO on that car.

446
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,900
We'll get her back, Gibbs.

447
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,900
You think she's already dead.

448
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,700
I think today's a real bad day to be the director of NCIS, Officer David.

449
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,600
That's a nice plane out there.

450
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,100
G-3, right?

451
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,100
I wouldn't know.

452
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,500
Range: 4,100 nautical miles...

453
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,000
...unless you risk refueling.

454
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,200
But you don't look like the European type to me.

455
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,600
I'm thinking more Mexico or the Caribbean.

456
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,900
Yeah, Mexico'd be great.

457
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,600
My baby brother's always wanted to see Cabo.

458
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,900
Maybe you can take him there...

459
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,500
in 30 to 40 years.

460
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,600
Where's you pilot, Dempsey?

461
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,300
I told you he's on his way.

462
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,200
What the hell? You've got her in full view of the window, mate.

463
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,000
-I tried to tell him.
-No one's going to see her.

464
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,000
That's a dangerous assumption.

465
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,000
Who knows how many people saw you stuff me into the back of your car?

466
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,000
You've kidnapped the head of a federal agency.

467
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,400
They take that very seriously.

468
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,500
Look, I know you're tight with your brother, mate, but you are not thinking!

469
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,000
She's just messing with you!

470
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,800
Well, she'd doing a good job of it.

471
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
How exactly do you see this thing working out?

472
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,800
We should've just shot her like her damn driver.

473
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,400
I gave NCIS two hours.

474
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,700
We only got 58 minutes left. Just relax.

475
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,800
We're gone as soon as your flyboy shows up.

476
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,800
We're not leaving without my brother.

477
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,400
It's your brother who screwed up!

478
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,000
Now I got to explain to my bosses how you lost our product

479
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,900
and you don't have the money to pay for it.

480
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,800
-I'm getting it back.
-Yeah?

481
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,500
Good luck with that.

482
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,000
'Cause I'm not sticking around to find out.

483
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,100
Looks like you have a difficult decision, James.

484
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,600
It's either him or your brother.

485
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,400
I trust you remembered my tea this time, Mr. Palmer.

486
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,800
It's only me, Ducky.

487
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,500
And I'm empty-handed.

488
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,600
Uh, well, the coffee stand is unable to master

489
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,000
the art of brewing a decent cup of Earl Grey.

490
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,300
Those are from Brian Dempsey?

491
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,400
I cannot discuss it with you, my dear.
I don't mean to be rude.

492
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,700
No, I understand, Ducky.

493
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,000
And you probably should be down here.

494
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,900
I shouldn't be here, I shouldn't be in the field.

495
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,800
Can you please, please tell me where I should be?

496
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,900
I can understand your feelings of alienation.

497
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,600
Everyone's avoiding me!

498
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,400
Do they think I'm going to lose control,

499
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,300
just enter the building and just massacre everyone?!

500
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,300
I mean, I am being treated like a leopard.

501
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,200
I believe the phrase is "like a leper."

502
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,800
Look, look, Ziva, you mustn't start blaming yourself.

503
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,100
I don't.

504
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,200
I know where I hit Brian Dempsey.

505
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,000
I know how severely I hit him.

506
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,900
And, Ducky, I know,

507
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,200
I know I didn't kill him.

508
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,600
Then why are you here?

509
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,400
Because I need for you to tell Gibbs that.

510
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,800
Tell me what, Ziva?

511
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,800
That the BOLO came back on the car the Director was kidnapped in.

512
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,700
It was abandoned three miles from the hotel.

513
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,800
It's en route to NCIS.

514
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,800
It should be here...

515
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,700
Back to your desk.

516
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,100
I'm of no use chained to a computer, Gibbs.

517
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,700
I should be out looking for her. I...

518
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,900
It wasn't a suggestion, Officer David.

519
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,100
-Uh, uh...
-I don't care.

520
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,100
Don't you think you're being a bit hard on her?

521
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,600
Not the time to hold hands, Ducky.

522
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,400
Even though you feel she's blameless?

523
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,700
Do you have anything to back that up?

524
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,900
I found blood on Mr. Dempsey's brain tissue.

525
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,500
He may have died of an intracranial hemorrhage.

526
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,200
-May have?
-Well, I sent

527
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,300
the tissue up for a full neuro report.

528
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
If that turns out to be the case,

529
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,000
the hemorrhaging could be the result of a pre-existing condition.

530
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,500
Or a well-placed strike to the jugular.

531
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,600
Yeah.

532
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,100
At this point, Jethro, the truth is anybody's guess.

533
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,700
<i>I thought you didn't believe in voodoo?</i>

534
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,500
This isn't voodoo, McGee.

535
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,400
It's tarot, The ancient art of divination.

536
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,900
So you're using tarot cards to find the Director?

537
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,300
Of course not.

538
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,700
Just helps me think.

539
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,900
We have less than an hour, so maybe you could be working?

540
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,100
I am identifying the mystery goo from Brian Dempsey's sneaker,

541
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,600
and don't forget the old saying.

542
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,000
-A watched GC mass spec...
-Never boils.

543
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,800
Well, I was going to say "Never compares relative

544
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,500
Concentration of atomic mass" but...

545
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
but where's my Caf-POW!
-Sort of in a time crunch here, Abs.

546
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,100
Gonna have to do this one caffeine free.

547
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,500
Bite your tongue.

548
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,200
Rule number nine...

549
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,400
always keep a spare.

550
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,400
I thought Gibbs said nine was "Always carry a knife"?

551
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,600
Not Gibbs' rules, mine.

552
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,400
Hmm. Got the physical evidence from the Director's town car:

553
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,400
cigarette butts, empty coffee cup.

554
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,900
and a half-sucked breath mint.

555
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,300
Nothing that gets us any closer to James Dempsey's location.

556
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,200
Ah, tarot.

557
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,100
The ancient art of divination.

558
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,000
<i>Guys, I've got something.</i>

559
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,700
I've got something here.

560
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,500
I plotted on the map the locations where Brian Dempsey made

561
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,300
credit card purchases in the last six months.

562
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,400
It's gas, ATM withdrawals, motel rooms, everything--

563
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,800
then I cross-referenced the cell towers that his phone interfaced with.

564
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,500
I can literally map out his life.

565
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Strip clubs, escort services off-track betting.

566
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,400
Guy had so much to live for.

567
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,600
According to my program, Brian Dempsey spent

568
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,100
the majority of his time in this 50-square-mile area.

569
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,300
And this helps us find the Director how?

570
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,700
Helps us narrow down the search radius.

571
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,000
You have any idea how long it takes to search 50-square miles, McGee?

572
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,500
Too long.

573
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,300
His name was Stanley.

574
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,000
The man you murdered in the parking garage, James.

575
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,500
I didn't kill your driver.

576
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,900
I tried to stop it.

577
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,300
Good.

578
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,400
Then you still have a chance of getting out of it.

579
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,200
That's more than I can say for your boss out there.

580
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,800
He's not my boss.

581
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,700
He's a business partner.

582
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,100
Well, I'd keep an eye on your business partner if I were you.

583
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,600
Yeah? Why's that?

584
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,000
'Cause it sounds like he's about to take off without you.

585
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,000
What are you doing?!

586
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,700
The pilot's here. We're leaving.

587
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,300
I'm about to make the call.

588
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,000
You really think the feds are going to negotiate with you, mate?

589
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
Yeah, I do.

590
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,100
Then you are even dumber than your kid brother.

591
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,500
They'll bring him and our drugs if they want to see their director alive again.

592
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,200
That's what's holding you back, huh?

593
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,500
Easy to fix.

594
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,900
I just shot him to get my brother back.

595
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,600
What do you think I'll do to you?

596
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,200
<i>Tick-tock, McGee.</i>

597
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,000
James Dempsey should be calling any second.

598
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,300
Tactical's pre-positioned in the search grid.

599
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,200
Okay, trace program's almost ready.

600
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,100
Just need another computer for backup.

601
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,100
Ooh, Ziva, you're not using this, are you?

602
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,600
Thanks.

603
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,000
I'm being wasted here.

604
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,300
You'll need me when James Dempsey finds out his brother's dead.

605
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,300
Don't need the brother.
Once we have a location, we take him out.

606
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,800
All the more reason why I should be...

607
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,400
Okay, we're connected.

608
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,200
Trace starts when you pick up, boss.

609
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,100
Yeah, Gibbs.

610
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,500
Listen carefully.

611
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,600
-One car. One agent in the back.
-Put Director Shepard on.

612
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,500
You're wasting time, Agent Gibbs.

613
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,500
-Time you don't have.
-Put her on or the deal's off.

614
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,600
He wants to know if you're still alive.

615
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,000
Play nice and you'll stay that way.

616
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,200
I'm fine, Jethro.
Wish I had my coat.

617
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,200
<i>Enough. One car.</i>

618
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,600
<i>One agent in the back.</i>

619
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,800
Drugs in the trunk, Brian drives.

620
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,100
See you in 45 minutes.

621
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,100
Where are we driving?

622
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,200
Leave that to my brother.

623
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,600
He knows where.

624
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,400
Don't be late.

625
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,400
Boss, Dempsey made the call over a VOIP system.

626
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,700
That's Voice Over Internet Protocol.

627
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,800
It's a wireless signal converted to analog,

628
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,300
How long to trace it, McGee?

629
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,400
Three hours, maybe two if I'm lucky.

630
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,900
-He said 45 minutes, Probie.
-Find another way.

631
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,700
How, Gibbs? The only person who knows where they are is lying dead in autopsy.

632
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,900
Did Brian Dempsey say anything to you before you killed him...

633
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,600
I mean, before he collapsed and died while in your custody?

634
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,900
I told you once. I did not kill that man, so stop making accusations that you can't...

635
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,800
Hey! She said she wanted her coat.

636
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,700
She trying to tell us something?

637
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,900
Maybe she's cold?

638
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,400
Some place cold.

639
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,800
<i>Perhaps she left something in her coat.</i>

640
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,200
She left it on the plane.

641
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,300
She's at an airport.

642
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,700
How do you know she's at an air...?

643
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,000
Of course. She's at an airport.

644
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,500
Pulling up every airport in a 45-minute drive from here.

645
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,700
<i>There's got to be at least a dozen.</i>

646
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,700
We'll never have time to sweep 'em all.

647
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,400
Maybe we won't have to. DiNozzo, McGee, with me.

648
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,000
On your six, boss.

649
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,800
I got the results back from Brian Dempsey's shoe goo.

650
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,800
It's a smorgasbord of Juicy Fruit, chewing tobacco, dog poo.

651
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,300
What's the point, Abby?

652
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,100
There are also trace elements of diolane and hexylene glycol.

653
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,000
It's fire-suppression foam.

654
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,500
So I'm thinking a manufacturing plant or a firehouse.

655
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,400
Abby. They're at an airport.

656
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,700
Or an airport.

657
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,600
Because they use it on the runway for emergency landings.

658
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,300
Well, you remember, a, uh, um,

659
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,800
a few weeks ago there was a commuter plane with faulty landing gear?

660
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,400
Yeah, we watched it for three hours on ZNN

661
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,000
waiting to see if it was gonna crash and burn.

662
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,600
-It was diverted to a small airfield.
-Which one, McGee?

663
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,000
Uh...

664
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,700
Potomac Air...

665
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,800
Potomac Airfield.

666
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,800
<i>Got the airport layout, Gibbs.</i>

667
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,600
I recommend we seal it off, go through building by building

668
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,600
with tactical assault teams.
<i>-It's an airfield.</i>

669
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,000
Do you expect to sneak up on him?

670
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,600
We don't exactly have a choice here.

671
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,000
-Maybe if his brother wasn't...
-Wasn't dead?

672
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,200
Yes, I think we established that. Thank you.

673
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,100
David's right-- we go in small. Cassie, McGee.

674
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,100
You two find out what building they're holding the director in.

675
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,400
-Well, how?
-I don't care, McGee. Trace the call.

676
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,400
Find out what planes are scheduled to take off.

677
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,600
-Just find it.
-On it.

678
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,700
Hey.

679
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,600
Hey!

680
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,300
Come on.

681
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,400
Uh, one problem, boss.

682
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,300
He's expecting his brother to drive.

683
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,700
Well, then, we give him what he wants.

684
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,200
We'll give him his brother.

685
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,900
Well, I guess I should thank you.

686
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,300
For what?

687
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,100
Him.

688
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,700
Friends are important, but in the end, family's all we really have.

689
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,600
Alex never understood that.

690
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,600
You did me a favor.

691
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,000
Well, let me do you another one.

692
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,500
You're a smart guy, James.

693
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,700
You know this isn't going to end well.

694
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,800
They are going to kill you.

695
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,100
Maybe even your brother.

696
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,100
Are you willing to risk Brian's life?

697
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,500
Well, that all depends.

698
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,200
Is NCIS willing to risk yours?

699
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,600
You try something like that with me again,

700
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,200
I will send you back in little pieces.

701
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,900
This is the second stupidest thing I've ever done.

702
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,100
Want to know what the first was?

703
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,600
No.

704
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,300
Less talking.

705
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,100
Ah, right. We should just tape the dead guy's hands to the steering wheel.

706
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,300
On it, boss.

707
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,600
Here we go.

708
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,500
It's show time, Bernie.

709
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,700
Three and 11.

710
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,500
Two and ten.

711
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,900
And that explains a lot.

712
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,100
Okay. All right. I need you to hold his head up, here.

713
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,900
-McGee.
-Yeah, boss.

714
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,900
We're at the airport. Got my location yet?

715
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,900
We're still working on the trace, boss.
We've localized the DNS servers.

716
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,300
Just having a little bit of trouble matching the computer's profile to the subnets.

717
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,000
Cassie? What about you?

718
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,900
I need every scheduled flight...

719
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,100
No. Today's flight plans.

720
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,100
Uh, Boss, she's still working on the flight plans.

721
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,300
Work faster.

722
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,400
They never had this much trouble with Bernie.

723
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,000
Who the hell is Bernie?!

724
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,600
Weekend at Bernie's. It's a cinematic masterpiece.

725
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,400
It's a... you know, blend of the comedic and the macab...

726
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,200
Thumbs down from the boss man.

727
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,900
We're outta time.

728
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,000
Gibbs, the only non-commercial aircraft

729
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,200
cleared to leave Potomac is from...
-Hangar number three!

730
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,800
<i>We're sending you the coordinates.</i>

731
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You sure this isn't the stupidest thing you've ever done, DiNozzo?

732
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,500
We're ready to go.

733
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,600
Time's up.

734
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,800
You were right.

735
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,400
Looks like your people don't care about you after all.

736
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,200
I told you.

737
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,700
NCIS does not negotiate with criminals, James.

738
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,000
Well, you better hope they're willing to make an exception for you.

739
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,900
<i>Are you trying to make me sick or something, Tony?</i>

740
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,600
You know what?

741
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,600
I can't see out the windshield, I'm driving with my hands.

742
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,800
and I still think I'm driving better than you.

743
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,200
To the left.

744
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,100
The other left!

745
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,300
It's kinda hard to concentrate

746
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,600
when your head is three inches from a dead guy's...

747
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,700
-Watch out!
-Which way? Which way?

748
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,500
You're driving straight into an airplane hangar.

749
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,400
Could you be a little more specific, please? Which way?

750
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,500
Make a left.

751
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,300
Now go straight.

752
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,200
Tony, straight!

753
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,500
Looks like your people came through for you after all.

754
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,600
So you're home free.

755
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,500
I'm not stupid.

756
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,200
I know they'll have people following.

757
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,500
But, in five minutes, I'll be 25,000 feet over the Atlantic.

758
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,800
Get up.

759
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
You see him?

760
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,900
Not yet.

761
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,700
Just remember, Gibbs doesn't want

762
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,600
you taking a shot until the director's clear.

763
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,900
You!

764
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,500
Out of the car!

765
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,300
Hands on your head!

766
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,700
Cuff yourself.

767
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,200
Hands behind your back.

768
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,300
I said cuff yourself!

769
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,900
Now lie down!

770
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,800
Very clever.

771
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,300
Brian, get the drugs!

772
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,100
Take 'em on the plane!

773
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,800
Be right behind you!

774
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,100
Get the damn drugs, Brian!

775
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,300
Bri...

776
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,400
They killed him.

777
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,300
You killed my baby brother!

778
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
It's actually a pretty interesting story.

779
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,600
I'm fine, Jethro.

780
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,700
Really.

781
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,600
It's a probie mistake.

782
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,500
Should have known better.

783
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,600
Never should have let my guard down.

784
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
How many times have we said that?

785
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,600
Stanley was a hell of an agent.

786
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,500
He didn't deserve this.

787
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,400
And I know what you're going to say.

788
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm the director now, it comes with the territory,

789
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,500
but I hope to God I never get used to it.

790
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,700
Are you ever going to say anything?

791
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,200
Have a drink.

792
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,500
I have the results of Ron Dempsey's neuropath report.

793
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,400
The hemorrhaging was caused by a congenital defect

794
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,900
in the subarachnoid artery.

795
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,000
He died of a brain aneurism?

796
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,800
Present since birth.

797
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,900
The young man was a walking time bomb.

798
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,000
Every time bomb has a trigger, Duck.

799
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,500
Well, anything could've precipitated his death.

800
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,600
A cough, a sneeze.

801
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,200
A blow to the throat.

802
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,600
Sounds like natural causes to me.

803
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,200
Exactly the way I ruled it.

804
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:13,900
Thx to Relax & Raceman.
