1
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,620
我不会忘记Gibbs抓住这变态的那天
I will never forget the day that Gibbs caught this psycho.

2
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,410
你那时候就认识他了?
You knew Gibbs back then?

3
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,390
不. 我那时是在乔治城的一名大三学生 有两年的时间
No. I was a junior at Georgetown. And for two years,

4
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,500
城里每个女的都害怕在晚上出门
every woman in D.C. was afraid to go out at night.

5
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,360
那肯定是很难了
Must have been tough.

6
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,150
是啊, 你是不知道 我的确是欠了Gibbs的
Yeah,you have no idea. I actually owe Gibbs

7
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,500
让我在进大学后睡了一个整晚的好觉
for the first full night of sleep I got in college.

8
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,900
Mm, 我是指约会
Mm,I meant dating.

9
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,840
对, 没错, 约会很难
Yes,yes,dating was tough.

10
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,930
现在那方面需要什么帮助吗, Paula?
Need any help with that now,Paula?

11
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,580
不, Tony, 谢谢
No,Tony,thank you.

12
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,080
我经历过也做过了
I've been there and I've done that.

13
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,440
哎呀!
Ouch.

14
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,870
你和女人的问题就在于你关注在哪儿
Your problem with women is where you're focused.

15
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,310
哪儿?
Where?

16
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:49,930
这里
Here.

17
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,640
是个镜子
It's a mirror.

18
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,160
快速问答
Quick question.

19
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,500
粉红色的. 它们吃起来是不是草莓味的?
The pink ones.Do they taste like strawberry starburst?

20
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,990
我以为你说过你没有和什么人约会
I thought you said you weren't seeing anyone.

21
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,100
我没说
I'm not.

22
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,220
是用于一些情形中的
It's for my complexion.

23
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,640
情形, 有名字吧?
Complexion got a name?

24
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,860
Tony, 你别来这一套
Tony,you so don't want to go there.

25
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,600
只是告诉我那个人别是个探员 因为我真的不认为我能...
Just tell me it's not another agent, 'cause I really don't think I can...

26
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,950
他叫Bob, 他是个律师
His name's Bob,and he's a lawyer.

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,090
太巧了. 我讨厌律师
What a coincidence.I hate lawyers.

28
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,890
我知道. 我也是
I know. So do I.

29
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,350
那就是为什么只是个性关系罢了
That's why it's purely a sexual relationship.

30
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,210
那个跟我有什么关系?
Well,what would that make me?

31
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,170
错大了. 如果你不...
A big mistake.If you do not...

32
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,550
...把避孕丸还给我 我会把你胳膊给拧折了
...give me my birth control pills, I'm going to break your arm.

33
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,500
拿了杯咖啡
Got that coffee.

34
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,380
你在那儿呆了很久了?
Have you been there long?

35
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,540
呃, 时间长得可以说 "不, 长官, Cassidy探员"
Uh,long enough to say, "No,ma'am,Agent Cassidy."

36
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,060
好吧, 答得好
Okay,good answer.

37
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,710
谢谢
Thank you.

38
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,330
我让她那么做的
I let her do that.

39
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,860
谢谢
Thank you.

40
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,880
那是谁?
Who's that?

41
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,550
Kyle Boone
Kyle Boone.

42
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,170
实习的, 他是个恶名昭彰的连环杀手
He's an infamous serial killer,

43
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,320
在90年代在城里制造了恐怖 知道了吧
Probie terrorized the District in the 90s. Come on.

22名女性失踪了, 找到了5具尸体
22 women went missing and five bodies were found.

45
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,450
那家伙只犯了一个错误
Guy only made one mistake.

46
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,570
他杀了个漂亮的女长官
He killed a petty officer.

47
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,290
Gibbs抓住他的?
Gibbs caught him?

48
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,520
定于周六进行政府批准的死刑裁决
Scheduled for a government-sanctioned dirt-nap on Saturday.

49
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,050
在合上电闸前他想和Gibbs谈谈
He wants to talk to Gibbs before they flip the switch.

50
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,800
为什么?
Why?

51
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,510
声称他会告诉他们那些尸体在哪里
Claims he's gonna tell them where the bodies are.

52
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,340
做什么把那东西放在我的屏幕上?
What the hell is that doing on my screen?

53
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,490
- 呃, 我没放在那儿, 老大 - 谁做的, McGee?
- Uh,I didn't put it there,boss. - Who did,McGee?

54
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,580
实习的, 让我来处理
Probie,let me handle this.

55
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,360
老大...
Boss...

56
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,290
她干的
she did it.

57
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,400
我们听说你在见...
We heard you were interviewing...

58
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,200
Kyle Boone, 我们猜我们可能 能够提供些支持
Kyle Boone,and we assumed that we would be providing backup.

59
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,720
你们的听说有误, Cassidy 我没有见什么人
You heard wrong,Cassidy. I'm not interviewing anyone.

60
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,960
哦, 那好, 你可能会想让 弗吉尼亚州长知道的
Oh,well,then you might want to let the Governor of Virginia

61
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,990
因为MTAC(多重威胁预警中心)已让他 待命, 在等着你的电话呢
know,since MTAC has him standing by,waiting for your call.

62
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,720
给她弄张桌子
Find her a desk.

63
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,510
- 那一张... - 不行, 给占了
- Is that one... - No,it's taken.

64
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,080
有一整个星期和Gibbs打照面 我都能嗅出有趣的味道了
A whole week of T.A.D. with Gibbs. I can smell the fun already.

65
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,810
那一个月可不好过
Well,it's been a tough month.

66
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,150
现在他差不多恨所有人, Paula
Right now he pretty much hates everyone,Paula.

67
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,760
包括他自己
Including himself.

68
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,790
你们的司长告诉我你今天下午
I was told by your Director that you would personally

69
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,840
想要单独见Kyle Boone, Gibbs探员
be interviewing Kyle Boone this afternoon,Agent Gibbs.

70
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,250
Shepard司长告诉了您错误的消息 州长
Director Shepard was misinformed,Governor.

71
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,720
和Kyle Boone谈就是浪费时间
Talking to Kyle Boone would be a waste of time.

72
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,820
也许是的, 但如果确有可能他对你
Possibly,but if there's even a chance that he would reveal

73
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,530
说出来那些受害人的位置, 我们得试试
to you the location of his victims,we have to take it.

74
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,690
我不同意, 长官
I disagree,sir.

75
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,510
他已经有十年的时间来好好想想了 为什么他现在回心转意了?
He's had ten years to think about it. Why the change of heart now?

76
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,280
就我的经验来说
In my experience,

77
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,270
临近死亡的人倾向于重新评价他们 的生命历程
men facing imminent death tend to reevaluate the course of their lives.

78
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,730
- 很多人会寻求原谅 - 相信我, 长官
- Most seek forgiveness. - You trust me,sir.

79
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,540
Boone有很多种兴趣
Boone had a lot of interests.

80
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,470
原谅可不是其中之一
Forgiveness wasn't one of them.

81
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,050
你怎么能这么肯定?
How can you be so sure?

82
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,020
我花了五个月来审问他
I spent five months interrogating him.

83
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,110
十年前
A decade ago.

84
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,350
- 人会变的 - 人, 长官
- People change. - People,sir.

85
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,210
可能会
Maybe.

86
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,460
Kyle Boone不会
Not Kyle Boone.

87
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,510
你是在拒绝和他会面?
Are you refusing to meet with him?

88
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,660
我是在拒绝娱乐一个谋杀狂
I'm refusing to entertain a homicidal maniac

89
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,700
他折磨并杀害了22名女性, 长官
who tortured and killed 22 women,sir.

90
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,360
我以前玩过了那种游戏
I have played that game before.

91
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,790
对于那些失去了女儿, 姐妹或母亲的
And the hundreds of family members who lost a daughter

92
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,010
几百名家庭成员?
a sister or a mother?

93
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,590
我该怎么和他们说?
What do I tell them?

94
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,230
不管在接下来的几天里Kyle Boone 会说什么
That no matter Kyle Boone says in the next few days,

95
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,990
到了周六时, 长官, 您得确保 他给烤了
come Saturday,sir,you're going to make sure he fries.

96
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,920
你将他受法, 我们都欠你个感激债
We all owe you a debt of gratitude for bringing him

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,450
Gibbs探员, 但是, 呃... 你让我没得选择
to justice,Agent Gibbs,but,uh... you leave me little choice.

98
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,960
对不起
I am sorry.

99
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,100

SYNC:YTET-wk120 -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-

100
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,610
长官! 有个从MTAC来的找你的
Sir! We've got a high

101
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,000
优先传输连接
priority transmission coming through for you in MTAC.

102
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,460
- 谁的? - 海军部长
- From who? - Secretary of the Navy.

103
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,550
哦, 往好的方面想想吧
Well,look on the bright side.

104
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,880
好的方面是什么?
What is the bright side?

105
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,180
你只会在这儿一个礼拜
You're only here a week.

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,540
为什么不能用Kate的桌子?
Why couldn't I sit at Kate's desk?

107
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,900
很大程度上是因为那仍是Kate的桌子
Mostly,because it's still Kate's desk.

108
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,180
她是个出色的探员
She was a great agent.

109
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,690
是的
Yep.

110
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,920
你是怎么处理的?
How are you handling it?

111
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,510
和处理所有的事情一样-- 试着不去想它
Same way I handle everything-- try not to think about it.

112
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,080
不起作用的时候呢?
And when that doesn't work?

113
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,640
总是会有垃圾食品的
There's always junk food.

114
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,000
听上去不怎么健康, Tony
Doesn't sound very healthy,Tony.

115
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,990
要不那样, 要不就在我的地下室里 开始建艘船
It's either that or I start building a boat in my basement.

116
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,650
你从你的公寓搬走了?
Did you move from your apartment?

117
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,840
没有. 现在你知道我的两难了
No. Now you see my dilemma.

118
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,100
如果你想谈谈的话, 我会在的
If you ever do want to talk about it,I'm here for you.

119
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,230
好吗?
Okay?

120
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,670
你说真的?
You mean that?

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,580
是的, 当然我是说真的
Yes,of course I mean that.

122
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,450
好的
Okay.

123
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,410
好吧, 那么, 我来问问你
Well,then,let me ask you something.

124
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,970
Bobbie在床上表现如何?
What's Bobbie like in bed?

125
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,800
Kate是对的. 你是真的, 真的可怜 DiNozzo
Kate was right.You are truly, truly pathetic,DiNozzo.

126
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,630
呃, 你们俩可能会想要开始工作 Gibbs朝这边来了, 而且看上去不高兴
Uh,you two might want to get busy. Gibbs's headed this way and he looks pissed.

127
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,010
他会不会听了州长的?
Think he caved to the Governor?

128
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,880
- 不可能 - 不可能
- No way. - No way.

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,720
如果Gibbs不想做什么, 他就不会的
If Gibbs doesn't want to do something,he doesn't.

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,970
不管是谁要求
No matter who's asking.

131
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,770
你要去哪儿, 老大?
Where you going,boss?

132
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
萨塞克斯州监狱
Sussex State Prison,

133

134
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,640
后面都会在那儿耗着
Be gone the rest of the day.

135
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,110
没错, 你俩肯定是把他给看死了
Yep,you two sure have him pegged.

136
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,640
周一我们把他移到死囚牢房了
We moved Boone to death watch on Monday.

137
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,100
就是那时候他决定他想要谈谈
That's when he decided he wanted to talk.

138
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,150
在弗吉尼亚这儿我们的做法有些不一样
We do things a little different here in Virginia.

139
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,760
被判死刑的可以选择:
The condemned get a choice:

140
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,790
注射致命药物或是电刑
lethal injection or death by electrocution.

141
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,270
Boone是选择电椅的第一个人
Boone is the first one to choose the chair.

142
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,430
- 应受到更严厉的 - Gibbs探员?
- Deserves worse. - Special Agent Gibbs?

143
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,150
我是Adam O'Neill Kyle Boone的律师
真是很感谢你能来
I'm Adam O'Neill,Kyle Boone's attorney. I really appreciate your coming.

144
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,130
我, 呃... 我理解你不愿意来这儿
I,uh... I understand your reluctance here.

145
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,710
但我确实相信我委托人的意图是 发自真心的
But I truly believe that my client's intentions are sincere.

146
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,420
我逮捕你委托人的那天
The day I arrested your client,

147
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,810
我们在他的冰箱里发现了两根 人类女性的舌头
we found two human female tongues in his refrigerator.

148
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,310
我对案子很熟, Gibbs探员
I'm familiar with the case,Agent Gibbs.

149
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,060
真的? 你对他的受害人的名字熟吗?
Really? You familiar with the names of his victims?

150
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,480
你看, 我不是来这儿谈过去的
Look,I'm not here to talk about the past.

151
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,420
我来这儿是想要救一个人的命
I'm here trying to save a man's life.

152
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,380
Boone想要做个交易?
Boone wants a deal?

153
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,050
不是. Boone先生想为他的罪行坐上电椅
No. Mr. Boone wants the chair for his crimes.

154
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,080
我是想要让他得到终生监禁
I'm the one hoping to get him life in prison.

155
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,640
祝你好运了
Good luck with that.

156
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,760
Gibbs探员, 拜托
Agent Gibbs,please.

157
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,540
在这儿我只在做我的工作
I'm just trying to do my job here.

158
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:27,150
可能一起的话, 我们能帮那些受害人 的家庭找到些终结
Maybe together,we can both help the victims' families find some closure.

159
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,960
周六一定到吧
Be there Saturday.

160
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,000
你会看见他们得到的
You'll be able to see them get that.

161
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,140
这边走, 先生们
Right this way,gentlemen.

162
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,580
事实上, 没有听从我的建议
Well,actually,against my advice,

163
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,160
Boone先生选择了单独见Gibbs探员
Mr. Boone has elected to meet with Agent Gibbs alone.

164
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,080
如果需要的话, 会有个守卫候在外面
There'll be a guard out here if you need him.

165
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,890
不需要
I won't.

166
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,000
很高兴再次见到你, Jethro
Nice to see you again,Jethro.

167
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,310
我还不确定你是不是会来 但是... 你来了.
I wasn't sure if you'd come, but... here you are.

168
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,900
给你两分钟的时间. 说吧
You've got two minutes.Start talking.

169
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,940
要知道, 你看上去差不多还是一样..
You know,you look almost the same...

170
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,760
除了头发
except the hair.

171
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,240
什么时候开始变灰白的?
When did it go gray?

172
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,300
那些尸体在哪儿?
Where are the bodies?

173
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,830
会说到的
We'll get to that.

174
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,050
有些事情我想要先问问你
There's just a few things I need to ask you first.

175
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,350
我猜他们给你看了我的纪念品了?
I guess they showed you my souvenirs?

176
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,360
那个罐子里有不到20个人的
There weren't 20 in that jar.

177
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,040
你是说..?
Your point?

178
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,230
我常想你是在虚报数目
I always thought you were padding your account.

179
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,060
哦. 给我下套? 毁我声誉?
Oh. Baiting me? Denigrating my rep?

180
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,230
得了. 你知道那方法不会对我起 作用的, Jethro
Come on. You know that approach never worked on me,Jethro.

181
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,570
1分38秒
A minute 38.

182
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,210
我们就不能聊聊吗? 聚一聚?
Can't we just chat for a bit? Catch up?

183
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,630
你太太怎么样了?
How's the wife?

184
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,900
她离开你了, 对吗?
She left you,didn't she?

185
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,440
我试过警告你的
I tried to warn you about that.

186
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,770
女人不会懂得像我们这样的男人
Women can't understand men like us.

187
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,290
你明白吗, Boone?
You got what,Boone?

188
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,950
还有三天活头?
Three days left?

189
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,460
感觉如何?
How's it feel?

190
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,880
有些害怕
I'm kind of terrified.

191
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,430
考虑到我以前的所做所为, 这很奇怪
Weird,considering my former activities.

192
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,390
据说在电椅上死掉得花上四分种
They say it can take up to four minutes to die in the chair.

193
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,300
就我个人来说?
Me,personally?

194
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,380
我希望能久得多
I'm hoping it takes a lot longer.

195
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,760
你真是变了
You really have changed.

196
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,020
以前的Gibbs从不会这么粗率
The old Gibbs would never be this abrupt.

197
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,990
你再婚了吗?
Did you remarry?

198
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,420
- 你只剩不到一分钟 - 好吧, 好吧, 太针对个人了
- You got less than a minute. - Okay,okay,too personal.

199
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,990
那么, 关于, 呃, NCIS的 Caitlin Todd探员呢?
Now,what about,uh,NCIS Special Agent Caitlin Todd?

200
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,180
我们能谈谈她吗?
Can we talk about her?

201
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,440
我在报上看见她照片了
I saw her picture in thePost.

202
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,610
听说是给恐怖分子给射杀的?
They said she was shot by a terrorist?

203
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,960
你有没有像我告诉的那样减少咖啡因 的摄入?
Did you cut back on the caffeine like I told you?

204
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,680
周六见
See you Saturday.

205
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,080
来吧, Gibbs. 我只和你说笑来的!
Come on,Gibbs.I was just having some fun with you!

206
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,810
你不能离开
You can't leave.

207
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,760
你来这儿是因为你得听从命令 就像是个优秀的海军陆战队员
You're here because you're following orders,like a good Marine.

208
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,390
对吧, Gunny?
Right,Gunny?

209
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,240
我会告诉你她们在哪儿的
I'll tell you where they are.

210
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,590
所有的她们在的地方
Where they all are.

211
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,900
可是要比22个来的多, Jethro
There's more than 22,Jethro.

212
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,700
多得多
Lots more.

213
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,410
- 他在哪儿, Timothy? - 呃, 谁?
- Where is he,Timothy? - Uh,who?

214
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,930
Gibbs, 可恶!
Gibbs,damn it.

215
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,740
你知不知道好的和坏的胆固醇水平 之间的差别, Tonny?
Do you even know the difference between good and bad cholesterol,Tony?

216
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,980
不, 但我猜那是和口味有关
No,but I'm assuming it has something to do with taste.

217
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,710
你最近的血液测试结果就是坏的
Bad is what came back on your last blood test.

218
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,430
扔了这个
Dispose of this.

219
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,970
嘿, 嘿, 那可是花了我16块, 那披萨
Hey,hey,that cost me 16 bucks,that pizza.

220
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,860
你到了我这年纪就会感谢我了
You'll thank me when you're my age.

221
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,840
- 可你总是吃披萨 - 没错
- But you eat pizza all the time. - Exactly.

222
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,350
我真是看不出来有什么关联
I don't really see the connection here.

223
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,500
哦, 当然你看不出来, 你又不是医生
Well,of course you wouldn't, you're not a doctor.

224
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,700
Gibbs在哪儿?
Where is Gibbs?

225
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,150
萨克塞斯州监狱, 在见Kyle Boone
Sussex State Prison, interviewing Kyle Boone.

226
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,050
- 他说他不会去的 - 他是没有
- He said he wasn't going. - He wasn't.

227
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,990
直到海军部长命令他去

- 谁同他一起? - 没人

229
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:00,100

Have you any idea the effect that psychopath had on Gibbs ten years ago?

考虑到Gibbs对他的私生活公开到 什么程度...
Considering how open Gibbs is about his personal life...

231
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,120
呃, 不, 一点不知道
uh,no,not a clue.

232
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,020
他不应该一个人去的
He should not have gone alone.

233
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,730
Ducky, 这是... 这是Gibbs 我肯定他会没事的
Ducky,it's... it's Gibbs. I'm sure he'll be fine.

234
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,190
你说说倒容易
That's easy for you to say.

235
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,210
那一次你是不必经受这个
You didn't have to live through this the last time.

236
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,750
DiNozzo
DiNozzo.

237
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,450
哪里?
Where?

238
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,270
是的, 明白, 老大. 我们就来
Yeah,I got it,boss. We're on our way.

241
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,350
正是他说的. 出发
That's what he said.Let's roll.

242
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,290
十年前和现在的区别, Ducky?
The difference between ten years ago and today,Ducky?

243
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,200
我们的Gibbs回来了
We have Gibbs' back.

244
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,540
还有另外个区别, Tony
There's another difference,Tony.

245
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,390
十年前, Gibbs是个很不一样的人
Ten years ago, Gibbs was a very different man.

246
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,970
你意思是他实际上更小器?
You mean he was actually meaner?

247
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,040
不是, 恰恰相反
No,quite the opposite.

248
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,040
他是...
He was...

249
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,270
他挺像你的
he was a lot like you.

250
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,970
这儿有什么?

253
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,260
120磅. 我是对的, 不是吗?
120 pounds. I'm right,aren't I?

254
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,720
你是不是在我睡着的时候称量了我?
Did you weigh and measure me in my sleep?

255
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,140
我是罪案现场的素描专家
I'm a crime-scene sketch expert.

256
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,220
- 是我的工作 - 你会做的
- It's what I do. - You'll do.

257
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,920
Gibbs, 再一次, 你是用这样的办法 让个女的感觉这么特殊
Gibbs,again,you have such a way of making a gal feel so special.

258
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,880
戴上这个
Put this on.

259
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,310
McGee?
McGee?

260
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,110
- 在, 老大? - 你可能会想要套上护膝
Yeah,boss?You might want to wear kneepads.

261
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,810
我们会有护膝吗?
Do we even have kneepads?

262
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,160
设备清单是Kate的事
Equipment inventory's Kate's job.

263
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,470
你可能会想要问问...
You might want to ask...

264
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,460
你知道我们到底是在做什么吗?
Do you know what the hell we're doing?

265
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,210
跟着Gibbs走
Following Gibbs' lead.

266
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,210
- 什么事情? - 我不知道
- On what? - I don't know.

267
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,940
你不知道, 这压根不会让你操心吗?
You don't know and that doesn't bother you at all?

268
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,320
你会习惯的
You get used to it.

269
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,600
是啊, 那正是我担心的
Yeah,that's what I'm afraid of.

270
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,560
这个地方肯定已经被翻过十来次了 老大
This place must have been gone over a dozen times,boss.

271
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,440
这儿不可能会有什么尸体的
No way there's any bodies in here.

272
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,180
不是在找尸体, Tony
Not looking for bodies,Tony.

273
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,990
Boone在这儿由他叔叔养大
Boone was raised here by his uncle.

274
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,480
他母亲是个妓女 在他12岁时离开了
His mother was a prostitute, she left town when he was 12.

275
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,860
- 那我们在找什么? - 证据
- Then what are we looking for? - Proof.

276
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,100
Boone发誓就在这儿
Boone swears it's here,

277
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,520
我们没有找过的唯一的地方就是 烟囱里面了
and the only place we didn't look is inside this chimney.

278
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,090
我想我发现了什么
I think I got something.

279
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,770
不是. 那只是又一只死鸟
No.That's just another dead bird.

280
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,080
哦, 真恶心
Oh,it's disgusting.

281
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,630
我打赌你在NCIS签到的时候这没有 在手册里, 实习的
Bet this wasn't in the brochure when you signed up for NCIS,Probie.

282
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,200
要知道, 你早先说错了
You know,you were wrong earlier.

283
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,250
什么?
About what?

284
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,660
她要比120磅重
She weighs more than a buck 20.

285
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,690
- 对不起 - 她是故意的
- Sorry. - She did that on purpose.

286
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,050
好了. 哦, 哦, 我拿到... 就在烟道边上
Okay.Oh,no,I got... it's right here by the flue.

287
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,100
我拿到了. 好了, 我下来了
I got it.Okay,I'm coming down.

288
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,240
终于. 要知道, 你应该脱下你的...
Finally.You know,you could have taken your...

289
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,150
- 天哪 - 我不对
- Jeez. - My bad.

290
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,490
看来像是本书
Looks like a book.

291
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,270
哦, 肯定能有30页
Oh,there must be 30 pages there.

292
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,570
不止
More.

293
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,000
是用什么刻进了她们的背?
What's carved into their backs?

294
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,940
是他的电话卡, McGee
It's his calling card,McGee.

295
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,060
有什么不对吗?
Something wrong?

296
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,340
关于我母亲的这部分, John 好了些, 但它还得要加工
This sectionon my mother,John, is better,but it still needs work.

297
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,390
我在试着让她更有人情味, Kyle
I was trying to humanize her,Kyle.

298
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,750
别
Don't.

299
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,650
你找到了对吧, Jethro?
You find it all right,Jethro?

300
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,040
我想如果你没找到的话是不会来的
I guess you wouldn't be here if you didn't.

301
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,220
我相信你还没见过我的传记作家 John Briggs
I don't believe you've met my biographer, John Briggs.

302
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,120
Gibbs探员, 很高兴.
Special Agent Gibbs, it is a pleasure.

303
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,420
这几个月来我一直在试着安排个时间 来见见你
I've been trying to schedule an interview with you for months.

304
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,080
你不得不将离开了, Briggs
You're going to have to leave now,Briggs.

305
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,420
我已由弗吉尼亚州批准特别许可了 守卫
I've been granted special permission by the state of Virginia to be here,Warden.

306
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,410
不再有了
Not anymore.

307
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,790
你下次要见Boone
Next time you see Boone,

308
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,630
他就会让你出些意外的
he'll have a thunderbolt shooting out of his ass.

309
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,810
嘿, 我是...
Hey,I was...

310
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,860
我给保证过在以后的三天我可以自由 进出
I was guaranteed full access for the next three days.

311
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,510
守卫要求你离开
The warden asked you to leave.

312
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,850
别让他再次要求
Don't make him ask you again.

313
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,950
你得谅解Gibbs探员, John
You'll have to excuse Agent Gibbs,John.

314
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,820
他终于得以窥见我告诉过他的世界了
He's finally gotten a glimpse into the world I've been telling him about.

315
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,640
剪贴簿?
Scrapbook?

316
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,080
你找到了他的剪贴簿? 什么时候...会发表出来?
You found his scrapbook? When... when will it be released?

317
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,610
小子, 如果你想自己走着出去的话
Son,if you want to walk out of here under your own power,

318
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,110
我建议你现在就离开
I suggest you leave now.

319
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,560
John真是个了不起的作家
John really is a wonderful writer.

320
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,540
你知道, 他花费了多年试图来了解我
You know,he's spent years trying to understand me.

321
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,940
不幸的是, 看来他只是从未合格过
Unfortunately,he just never seemed to measure up.

322
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,470
对谁?
To who?

323
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,880
你那妓女母亲?
Your prostitute mom?

324
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,730
或是你的父亲?
Or your father?

325
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,650
某个在兜里有几块钱的乡巴佬John
Some hick john with a few extra bucks in his pocket.

326
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,900
事实上, 我提到了你, Jethro
Actually,I was referring to you, Jethro.

327
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,440
演出结束
Show's over.

328
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,000
埋尸处在哪儿?
Where's the dumping ground?

329
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,960
你最后再给我看看我的剪贴簿
You show me my scrapbook one last time

330
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,400
我就会给你画张即便是个海军陆战 队员都能依照的图
and I'll draw you a map even a Marine can follow.

331
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,230
不行. 她们已经够遭罪了
No. They've suffered enough.

332
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,320
那么, 我们就成僵局了
Well,we're at an impasse.

333
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,700
你还要继续和我玩这个游戏吗, Boone?
You're going to keep playing this game with me,Boone?

334
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,270
我从来没把这个看成是个游戏, Jethro
I've never considered any of this a game,Jethro.

335
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,000
你知道的
You know that.

336
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,470
- 不管怎样. 我改规则了 - 怎么改法?
- Whatever.I'm changing the rules. - How so?

337
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,070
我已经见识了你的世界
I've seen your world.

338
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,400
现在你将在我的世界中耗尽你那悲惨 的一生中仅剩的部分了
Now you're going to spend what's left of your miserable life in mine.

339
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,620
好吧, 听着, 我的现场探查实习的 小朋友们
All right,listen up,my little probationary field agents.

340
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,270
你们将会目睹一次将个最高安全级的
You're about to witness the transfer

341
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,740
囚犯转到我们这粗陋设施的过程
of a maximum security prisoner to our humble facility.

342
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,830
他到达时, 他就是我们唯一的责任
While he's here, he's our sole responsibility.

343
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,050
- 哦, 很抱歉. 我烦着你了吗? - 天哪, 他就没停过吗?
- Oh,I'm sorry.Am I boring you? - My God,does he ever stop?

344
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,500
我只是很高兴那不是我
I'm just glad it's not me.

345
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,010
现在10点. 没理由现在就把Boone 带到这里
It's 10:00.Doesn't make any sense bringing Boone here now.

346
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,020
Gibbs想把他置于一个不熟悉的环境 让他失衡
Gibbs is trying to put him on unfamiliar ground,throw him off balance.

347
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,120
因为在十年前这招很管用?
Because that worked so well ten years ago?

348
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,560
- 现在有什么不一样? - 我有, Cassidy
- What's different now? - I am,Cassidy.

349
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,910
挺胸. 精神些, 实习的们
Stand tall.Lace up,Probies.

350
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,850
我知道我能指望上你的, Jethro
I knew I could count on you,Jethro.

351
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,180
再回到家真好
It's good to be home again.

352
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,430
是的. 回家真好
Yeah.Good to be home.

353
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,010
这家伙整晚都在扮雕像
Guy's been impersonating a statue all night.

354
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,370
据守卫说, 他一动也没动
According to the watch, he hasn't moved a muscle.

355
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,190
真让人毛骨悚然
It's creepy.

356
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,720
Gibbs什么时候会开始他的审问?
When is Gibbs going to start his interrogation?

357
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,930
在他准备好的时候
When he's ready.

358
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,320
你可能想要告诉他要他快点
Well,you might want to tell him to hurry.

359
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,640
在安排的Boone死刑执行前他只剩 不到48小时了
He's got less than 48 hours before Boone's scheduled to be executed.

360
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,260
我有个更好的主意, Paula
I've got a better idea,Paula.

361
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,150
为什么你不去告诉他呢?
Why don't you tell him?

362
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,210
因为我不蠢
'Cause I'm not stupid.

363
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,940
不会
No.

364
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,520
在你的所有特质当中
Of all the things you are,

365
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,470
愚蠢决不在其中
stupid definitely isn't one of them.

366
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,770
谢谢
Thank you.

367
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,320
好吧, 那究竟是什么意思?
Okay,what's that supposed to mean?

368
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,700
没什么. 顺便, Bobert怎么样了?
Nothing.By the way,how's Bobert?

369
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,360
怎么, 你嫉妒吗?
Why,are you jealous?

370
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,970
就那个律师? 算了吧
Of a lawyer?Give me a break.

371
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,240
- 他很有钱 - 钱不代表一切
- He's very rich. - Money isn't everything.

372
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,170
他有华盛顿红皮队的季赛票--
He's got season tickets to the Redskins--

373
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,900
私人的顶部包厢
private sky box.

374
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,180
真为他高兴
I'm happy for him.

375
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,970
我差点忘了... 他开的是辆法拉利
And I almost forgot... he drives a Ferrari.

376
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,490
- 红色的 - 像雷诺Magnum
- Red. - Like Magnum.

377
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,150
哦, 不错啊
Well,that's nice.

378
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,930
不是吗?
Isn't it?

379
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,950
你知道什么会更棒?
You know what's even nicer?

380
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,810
我现在看到的. 维多利亚的秘密 Cassidy探员
My current view.Victoria's Secret. Agent Cassidy.

381
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,670
哦, 随你享受多久, DiNozzo探员
Well,you enjoy it as long as you can,Agent DiNozzo.

382
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,860
因为那是你能得到的最近的距离
Because that's as close as you're going to get.

383
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,530
Cassidy?
Cassidy?

384
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,180
查查Boone的安全细节
Check Boone's security detail.

385
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,080
明白
You got it.

386
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,570
- 我来帮帮她 - 等等
- I'll give her a hand with that. - Wait.

387
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,780
- 那是为什么? - 让她影响到你
- What was that for? - Letting her get to you.

388
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,260
老大, 我不是在让她...
Boss,I was not letting her get...

389
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,480
别让这事再发生了
Won't let it happen again.

390
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,270
谢谢
Thanks.

391
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,780
是给Abby的
It's for Abby.

392
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,010
去看看她从Boone的剪贴簿本确认了 多少名受害人
Go find out how many victims she ID'd from Boone's scrapbook.

393
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,720
在剪贴簿里有27位女性, McGee
(缺一句)

394
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,270
就我所知道的, 她们是按被杀的先后 次序来排列的
And as far as I can tell,they're in the order that they were killed.

395
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,250
现在, Boone已承认杀死了22个人
Now,Boone has admitted to killing 22,

396
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,420
这和FBI发出的照片和档案相符
which matches with the photos and the files that the FBI sent over.

397
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,320
会让你认为我们还有五名Jane Doe (不知名的女性受害人)
Which would make you think that we'd be left with five Jane Does,

398
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,480
可你错了
but you'd be wrong

399
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:25,980
因为我知道
'cause I know

400
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,360
第一个受害人是谁
who the first victim is.

401
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,720
我说的你是一个字也没听进去
You're not listening to a word I'm saying.

402
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,840
我怀孕了, McGee
I'm pregnant,McGee.

403
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,070
双胞胎
Twins.

404
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,890
还没有告诉老爸
Haven't told the father yet.

405
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,100
是Gibbs的
It's Gibbs.

406
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,630
我知道这不对
I know it's wrong,

407
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,060
可是他那银发真是挺能撩拨人的
but something about his silver hair just gets me all tingly inside.

408
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,160
打断一小会儿, 我想我要吐了
Excuse me for a sec. I think I'm going to vomit.

409
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,610
我在开玩笑, Tony
I'm joking,Tony.

410
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,680
除了关于Gibbs银发的那部分 那真是性感
Except for the part about Gibbs'hair.That is really hot.

411
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,570
- McGee又不搭理我了 - 很容易修好
- McGee's ignoring me again. - Easily fixable.

412
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,910
干嘛? 我做了什么?
What? What'd I do?

413
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,350
别不理Abby. 她很敏感
Stop ignoring Abby.She's sensitive.

414
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,010
对不起. 我正全神贯注 我想我知道就算Gibbs不和他谈
I'm sorry.I was concentrating. I think that I know how we can

415
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,510
我们怎么可以找到Boone的受害人了
find Boone's victims without Gibbs having to talk to him.

416
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,240
在这些图片中的一些里面
There are distinctive geographical and man-made features

417
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,620
有些特别的地理特性和人造的特色
in several of these pictures.

418
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,510
有条河流... 这可能是座桥...
There's a stream... and what may be a bridge...

419
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,130
上面这儿, 看上去像是电力线
Up here,there appears to be a power line.

420
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,000
或是照片上的一些脏东西
Or some dirt on a picture.

421
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,880
如果我能做一个地面图
If I can make a land plot,

422
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,550
通过计算这些点之间的距离来做出 个数值范围
create scale by computing the distances between these points,

423
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,560
- 那我们就能... - 好了
- then we can... - Okay.

424
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,290
河流和电力线?
Streams and power lines?

425
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,140
光搜个小郡就得花上好几年
It would take years searching

426
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,200
McGee, 更别提是个州了
just one county,McGee, never mind a state.

427
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,460
对我们来说, 没错, Tony 可对计算机来说不是的
Yeah,for us,Tony, but not for a computer.

428
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,030
- 卫星成像? - 正是
- Satellite imagery? - Exactly.

429
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,020
我应该想到那个的
I should have thought of that.

430
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,720
我只是需要想个办法来算出 准确的范围
I just need to figure out a way to calculate an accurate scale.

431
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,500
偏光照相机有固定的焦距
Polaroid cameras have a fixed focal length.

432
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,440
会是个好开端
It's a good start.

433
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,100
呃, 我得需要个已知的尺寸
Uh,I'm going to need one known measurement.

434
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,090
选个人, 我把她的数据调出来
Pick one body and I'll pull her stats.

435
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,290
有三个已知的向量就行了
Three known vectors should do it.

436
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,580
- 四个可能会... - 好了, 好了
- Four would be... - Okay,okay.

437
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,780
这种古怪的谈话也够了
Enough with the geek-speak.

438
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,340
Gibbs想知道我们确认了多少受害人
Gibbs wants to know how many victims we ID'd.

439
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,470
所有的, 除了在剪贴簿里的最后四个
All,except for the last four in the scrapbook.

440
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,080
我们正在将她们与Gibbs把Boone
We're running them against missing persons reports

441
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,870
投进监狱前的失踪人员报告进行比对 还没有对上的
prior to Gibbs putting Boone behind bars.No matches yet.

442
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,840
最为显眼的那个人就是第一个受害者
The one that stands out the most is the first victim.

443
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,250
她是在1974失踪的
She disappeared in 1974.

444
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,260
你确定吗, Abs?
Are you sure about that,Abs?

445
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,410
那时Boone还只是个孩子
Boone was just a kid back then.

446
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,800
我知道
I know.

447
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,210
而且也表明他的妈妈没有遗弃他
And it turns out his mother did not abandon him.

448
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:14,090
她是他的第一个受害者
She was his first kill.

449
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,750
你不必再这么做了, 你知道
You don't have to do this again, you know.

450
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,370
你错了, Duck, 我必须
You're wrong,Duck,I do.

451
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,090
他不会告诉你那些可怜姑娘在哪里的
He's never going to tell you where those poor girls are.

452
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,230
我知道
I know that.

453
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,640
那为什么?
Then why?

454
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,910
因为十年前, 我突破不了他
Because ten years ago, I couldn't break him.

455
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,950
不, 可你做到了其他人做不到的
No,but you did what no one else could;

456
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,050
你逮住了这狗娘养的
you caught the son of a bitch.

457
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,370
我应该杀了他
I should have killed him.

458
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:49,010
两天后, 就可以调过来了
And in two days, that will be rectified.

459
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,120
作为个朋友让我来告诉你
I'm telling you as a friend,

460
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,190
是时候放开这个了
it's time to let this one go.

461
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,830
还不行, Ducky
Not yet,Ducky.

462
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,820
因为这个案子你已经失去了个关系
You already lost one relationship as a resultof this case.

463
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,340
我意思是, 她是个很好的女孩
I mean,she was a wonderful girl,

464
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,910
- 而你忽略了... - 她离开了我, Duck!
- and you neglected... - She left me,Duck!

465
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,140
我没有离开她!
I didn't leave her!

466
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,800
不, 你使她不可能再留着了
No,you made it impossible for her to stay.

467
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,720
好了, 把他带上来. 确保有人押送
Okay,send him up. Make sure he's escorted.

468
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,360
我会让Gibbs知道的
I'll let Gibbs know.

469
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,930
舒服吗?
Comfortable?

470
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,090
- 是的. 事实上, 我... - 这是个修辞方面的问题, 女士
- Yeah.Matter of fact,I... - It was a rhetorical question,lady.

471
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,810
Wow. 我还没意识到你对你的桌子 有多么敏感
Wow. I never realized how sensitive you were about your desk.

472
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,100
关于我还有很多东西你没意识到 Cassidy
There's a lot about me you don't realize,Cassidy.

473
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,530
- Gibbs在哪儿? - 审讯中
- Where's Gibbs? - Interrogation.

474
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,940
Boone的律师在这里
Well,Boone's lawyer is here.

475
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,040
他声称对于他的委托人被转移这事 他没有被通知
He claims he wasn't notified about his client's being moved

476
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,200
他想要和你谈谈
and he wants to talk to him.

477
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,530
哦, Gibbs不喜欢等人. 你最好是
Ooh,Gibbs doesn't like to be kept waiting.You better go

478
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,520
进去那儿并自己告诉他. 我去拿衣服
right in there and tell him yourself. I'll get the suit.

479
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,680
终于
Finally.

480
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,940
那么这次我们从哪儿开始呢, Jethro?
So where should we start this time, Jethro?

481
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,820
我的童年?
My childhood?

482
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,920
我把带到这儿来不是要谈的, Boone
I didn't bring you in here to talk,Boone.

483
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,310
那么, 你决定让我再看看我的剪贴簿?
So,you decided to let me see my photographs again?

484
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,380
我告诉过你, 那是不会发生的
I told you,that's not going to happen.

485
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,210
有趣
Interesting.

486
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,900
我能问问为什么我会在这儿吗?
May I ask why I'm here then?

487
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,290
州府希望我能得到你那些 受害人的位置
The State is hoping that I'll get the location of your victims.

488
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,260
我相信那需要某种形式的沟通
I believe that requires some form of communication.

489
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,290
我说的是"州府", 我?
I said,"the state." Me?

490
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,910
根本不会去试
Not even going to try.

491
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,930
但你经常试的, Jethro 这就是为什么我喜欢你
But you always try,Jethro. That's why I like you.

492
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,900
我已经把你弄出那体系了, Boone
I've taken you out of the system, Boone.

493
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,190
你会孤单地坐在这里
You're going to sit here alone,

494
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,720
在上电椅烤前没有任何的与人接触
without any human contact until you fry.

495
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,640
游戏现在结束了
The game ends now.

496
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,840
这个房间带回了那么多记忆
This room brings back so many memories.

497
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,080
不是吗?
Doesn't it?

498
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,940
Gibbs探员? 说句话, 谢谢
Special Agent Gibbs? A word,please.

499
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,550
听上去那个死了的女人有个替代的了
Sounds like you replaced your dead female.

500
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,140
有机会让我能见见这个吗?
Any chance I can meet this one?

501
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,550
那么, 如果你需要我, 我就在这儿
Well,I'll be here if you need me.

502
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,190
什么?!
What?!

503
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,440
Boone的律师在这里
Boone's attorney's here.

504
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,580
地方法院检查官担心如果我们拒绝他去 见他的委托人
The D.A.'s afraid if we deny him access to his client,

505
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,170
那么他会去找个同情的法官并有借口
then he'll find a sympathetic judge and have cause to have

506
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,150
- 让死刑执行延后 - 明白了
- the execution delayed. - I got it.

507
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:11,590
嘿, 我需要和我的委托人进行特许 的会谈
Look,I need a privileged conversation with my client.

508
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:12,530
意思是, Gibbs探员
Meaning,Agent Gibbs,

509
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,500
我要你们将观察室清干净, 所有的 麦克风也要给关了
I want your observation room cleared and all microphones turned off.

510
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,020
- 就那样吗, 法律顾问? - 目前是的, 探员
- That's it,counselor? - For now,Agent.

511
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,300
Tony?
Tony?

512
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,380
好了, 等一等
Yeah,hold on a second.

513
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,000
先搜搜他...
Search him first...

514
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,970
彻底地
thoroughly.

515
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,910
真让我激赏
I'm impressed.

516
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,590
它真起作用的
It's actually working.

517
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,170
谢谢
Thank you.

518
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,210
现在我们要做的就是扫描卫星成像
Now all we have to do is scan through 800,000 miles

519
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,450
的80万英里, 祈祷我们能走运
of satellite imagery and pray we get lucky.

520
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,450
我是个科学家, McGee
I am a scientist,McGee.

521
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:52,110
运气和这个和/或我们没什么关系
Luck has nothing to do with it and/or us.

522
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,050
好吧, 那你怎么解释像是Gibbs的直觉 那样的东西呢?
Okay,then how do you explain something like Gibbs's gut?

523
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:57,960
哦, 那容易
Well,that's easy.

524
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,490
Gibbs走运
Gibbs is lucky.

525
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,740
- 可你刚才说是... - 他不是科学家
- But you just said that... - He's not a scientist.

526
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,740
Gibbs探员
Agent Gibbs,

527
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,150
如果我的委托人在这里的期间 发生了什么事
if anything happens to my client while he's here,

528
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,630
我想让你知道我会让你
I want you to know I am going to hold you

529
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:12,870
个人负责...
personally responsible...

530
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,660
你有我的保证, 他会有良好的健康 等着他的死刑
You have my word he will be in perfect health for his execution.

You'll be hearing from me.

533
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,350
走吧
Let's go.

534
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,800
你还要回那儿去吗, 老大?
You going back in there,Boss?

535
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,230
- 是的, 也许 - Gibbs
- Yeah,maybe. - Gibbs.

536
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,220
Gibbs, 是Abby. McGee和我认为 我们可能已经找到了
Gibbs,it's Abby. McGee and I think we might have found

537
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,410
Boone的弃尸地. 我们是在我实验室 里的屏幕上找到的
Boone's dumping ground. We've got it on the screen in my lab.

538
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,800
他们认为他们可能已经找到了 他的弃尸场所
They think they may have found his dumping ground.

539
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:42,880
我在看的是什么东西?
What am I looking at?

540
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,930
开动啊, Mc-Key
Take it,Mc-Key.

541
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,080
我意思是, um, 那McGee探员
I mean,um,very Special Agent McGee.

542
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,010
那些受害人被折磨, 杀害并可能被 埋的可能地点
Probable site where the victims were tortured,killed and perhaps buried.

543
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,750
- 想知道我们是怎么做的吗? - 不想
- You want to know how we did it? - Not really.

544
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,700
- 那好, 因为大都是靠运气 - 在哪里?
- Good,'cause it was mostly luck. - Where?

545
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,720
荒野区, 大瀑布市国家公园
Wilderness area, Great Falls National Park.

546
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,910
- Tony, 你带队 - 好的
- Tony,you lead the team. - Right.

547
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,690
- 你去哪儿, 老大? - 经过了十年
- Where you going,Boss? - After ten years,

548
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,950
我终于有一些Boone还不知道的东西
I finally got something on Boone he doesn't already know about.

549
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,180
我的律师还是不安
My lawyer was very upset.

550
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,190
他想要把我移回到监狱里去
He wanted to move me back to prison.

551
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,520
但是别担心. 我告诉他我喜欢这儿
But don't worry. I told him I like it here.

552
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,620
别弄得太舒服了. 你今天就会回去
Don't get too comfortable. You're going back today.

553
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,170
真的? 什么事变了?
Really?What's changed?

554
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,420
你发现了什么, 对吧?
You found something,didn't you?

555
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,220
拍这些照片的地方
The site where the photos were taken

556
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,800
是在310度路上的265英尺处
is 265 feet on a track of 310 degrees.

557
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,040
我们得穿过这里
We need to get through here.

558
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,540
好的
Okay.

559
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,550
记得我教过你的毒藤的事, 对吧?
Remember what I taught you about the poison ivy,all right?

560
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,970
- 别告诉Cassidy - 什么?
- Don't tell Cassidy. - What?

561
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,870
没事
Nothing.

562
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,610
跟着我
Follow me.

563
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,940
我没事. 我没事
I'm okay. I'm okay.

564
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,680
很陡
This is steep.

565
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,050
你们小心
Watch yourselves.

566
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,130
如果这就是那地方, 我能明白为什么 Boone会挑上它
Well,if this is the place, I can see why Boone picked it.

567
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,910
远离一般常走的路
Off the beaten path,

568
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,410
没有硬地面来反射声音
no hard surfaces to reflect sound.

569
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,460
那些女孩就算把喉咙喊破也不会 有人听见
Those girls could scream their heads off and no one would hear.

570
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,400
没错, 这是个完美的地点
Yeah,this is the perfect spot.

571
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,280
伙计们
Guys,

572
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,070
我们是在正确的地方了
we're in the right place.

573
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,420
没信号
No reception.

574
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:22,940
分散开, 用胶带隔离
Spread out,tape it off.

575
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,910
我们得走回去打电话给Gibbs
We'll hike back and call Gibbs.

576
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,950
来吧, Jethro
Come on,Jethro,

577
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,090
我们俩都知道你就在那里
we both know you're in there.

578
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,330
- 嘿 - 嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

579
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,130
你在这儿做什么?
What are you doing here?

580
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,220
我想来看看怪物长得是什么样的
I wanted to see what the monster looks like.

581
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,970
他看上去没那么吓人
He doesn't look that scary.

582
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,700
你看了照片了?
You saw the photographs?

583
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,780
是的
Yeah.

584
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,380
做得好, McGee
You did good,McGee.

585
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,870
为你感到骄傲
I'm proud of you.

586
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,680
还有呢?
And?

587
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:13,800
还有什么?
And what?

588
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,490
通常你会在最后加上些侮辱的话
Well,usually you add some kind of insult at the end.

589
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,740
不, 我不会
No,I don't.

590
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,300
好了, 可能有时候会
Well,okay,maybe sometimes.

591
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,390
- 但关键是我们是个团队并且... - Whoa! Tony?
- But the point is we're a team and... - Whoa! Tony?

592
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,050
你没事吧?
You all right?

593
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,900
我有些, 呃, 有些受惊
I was,uh,a little startled.

594
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,500
因为什么?
By what?

595
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,570
她
Her.

596
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,550
她死了才有几天的时间
She couldn't have been dead more than a few days.

597
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,900
Tony, 你不会相信这个的
Tony,you're not going to believe it.

598
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,500
Boone的标记
Boone's mark.

599
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,840
我-我... 这儿收不到任何信号
I-I... I can't get any reception out here.

600
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,240
那不奇怪
That's not surprising.

601
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,730
可"无名地" 不是我们搜索计划的 一部分
"Butt nowhere" isn't part of our coverage plan.

602
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,790
我要回到卡车那儿, 试着打通电话
I'm gonna head back to the truck and try and get the call through.

603
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,500
好的. 告诉Gibbs我们在这儿需要 装备需要人来
Okay. Tell Gibbs we're gonna need everything and everyone on this one.

604
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,360
我20分钟后就回来
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

605
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,800
喂. Gibbs
Yeah. Gibbs.

606
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,650
Gibbs...
Gibbs...

607
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:42,040
- 我们找到了Boone的弃尸地 - 干得好
- we found Boone's dumping ground. - Good work.

608
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,140
- 告诉Tony他得打电话给... - 我们还找了具最近的尸体
- Tell Tony he needs to call... - We also found a fresh body.

609
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,160
女性. 死了不到一个星期
Female. Dead less than a week.

610
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,530
她的背上有Boone的标记
She has Boone's mark on her back.

611
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,830
我想我们肯定在对付一个模仿杀手
I think we're definitely dealing with a copycat killer.

612
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,220
Gibbs? Gibbs, 能听到我吗?
Gibbs? Gibbs,can you hear me?

613
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,590
是的, 我听到你了
Yeah,I heard you.

614
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:00,240
我需要将那区域封锁. 我就来
I want the area sealed off. I'm on my way.

615
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,190
Tony
Tony.

616
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,790
有些不对劲
Something's not right.

617
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,200
自从Boone在NCIS出现后就没事对劲
Well,nothing has been since Boone showed up at NCIS.

618
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,480
不, 不. 我-我认识这个女孩
No,no. I-I know this girl.

619
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,310
你认识她? 怎么会?
You know her? How?

620
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,150
你也认识她. 她是最后进Boone的 剪贴簿的--
You know her,too.She was the last entry in Boone's scrapbook--

621
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,530
Jane Doe其中的一个
one of the Jane Does.

622
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:29,140
他在受死名单上已经十年了, McGee
He's been on death row for ten years,McGee.

623
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,560
她在这儿不超过一个星期.
She's been here less than a week.

624
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,930
不可能啊
It's not possible.

625
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,300
不会的
It can't be.

626
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,990
你看上去有些憔悴, Jethro
You look a little peaked,Jethro.

627
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,450
有什么不对吗?
Something wrong?

628
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,870
也许我能帮上忙
Maybe I can help.

629
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,880
- 有个新进展 - 可能吧?
- A new development, - perhaps?

630
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:03,370
我得交给你了, Boone 我已经尽了力
I got to hand it to you,Boone. I did my best.

631
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,680
但你使我在玩你的游戏--祝贺你
But you got me to play your game-- congratulations.

632
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,650
你找到尸体了. 很好
You found the bodies. Good.

633
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,800
不是你所期望的, 对吗?
Not what you were expecting, was it?

634
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,420
你瞧, 现在那外面有另外某人--
You see,there's someone else out there now--

635
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,050
一个新的威胁--
a new threat--

636
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,610
而我是唯一的一个能帮你找到他的人
and I'm the only one who can help you find him.

637
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,130
你得要求对我的处决延期
You'll have to request a stay of my execution.

638
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,610
不得不传达这个意思了. Mm-mm
Gonna have to pass on that. Mm-mm.

639
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,790
不管这出戏怎么演法
No matter how this plays out,

640
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,740
周六你都将会坐在那张椅子上
you're gonna sit in that chair Saturday.

641
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,550
你这方面改不了这么多. 你有宣誓 过的职责
You can't have changed this much. You have a sworn duty.

642
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,980
可能吧, 十年前的话
Maybe ten years ago.

643
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,580
现在...见鬼吧...
- Now... - hell...

644
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,620
我能等到周日再开始调查
I can wait till Sunday to start an investigation.

645
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,560
- 你在虚张声势 - 36小时后你就死了
- You're bluffing. - You're dead in 36 hours.

646
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,120
那么, 你要是改主意了我会在这儿的
Yeah,well, I'll be here when you change your mind.

647
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,680
Cassidy!
Cassidy!

648
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,710
Cassidy!
Cassidy!

649
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,630
好极了! 她迷路了
Great! She's lost.

650
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:15,100
为什么你不给她你的GPS玩意儿 实习的?
Why didn't you give her your GPS thingie,Probie?

651
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,800
她没有迷路
She's not lost.

652
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,430
出什么事了?!
What's going on?!

653
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,380
她给绑架了
She's been kidnapped.

654
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,800
McGee, 那自Boone坐监以来
McGee,where is my list of every visitor and phone call

655
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,380
关于他所有访客和电话的单子呢?
Boone's had since being in prison?

656
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,480
正在弄, 老大
Working it,boss.

657
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,640
Tony?
Tony?

658
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,290
Tony!
Tony!

659
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,080
- 支援队到位了吗? - 是的
- Backup teams in place? - Yeah.

660
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,990
我不应该那样让她独自去的, 老大
I never should've let her take off like that alone,Boss.

661
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,460
Cassidy的照片很干净; 没有指纹 也没有DNA
The Polaroid of Cassidy's clean; there's no prints,no DNA.

662
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,700
对不起, Gibbs, 我把事情搞砸了
I'm sorry,Gibbs, I screwed this whole thing up.

663
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,730
你搞砸了?
You screwed it up?

664
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,590
我们应该知道有不只一个杀手的--
We should've known there was more than one killer--

665
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,740
我只查了Boone被抓前的Jane Does
I only ran the Jane Does up until the time Boone was captured.

666
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,940
那所有的四个人都是在过去三年中 失踪的
All four have gone missing in the last three years.

667
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,460
着重在过去三年中Boone的联系人
