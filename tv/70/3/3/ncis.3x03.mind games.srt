1
00:00:07,087 --> 00:00:09,157
-Step down.
-Go.

2
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:16,718
Go ahead and open it up.

3
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:23,598
Up there.

4
00:00:35,727 --> 00:00:38,400
Tell me this has not been
just a total waste of my time, trooper.

5
00:00:38,727 --> 00:00:42,037
There's something up here, sir.
l'm just not exactly sure what it is.

6
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:45,761
You promised us bodies.

7
00:00:46,407 --> 00:00:48,159
One thing at a time, warden.

8
00:00:48,327 --> 00:00:51,046
First we start with my souvenirs.

9
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:52,999
- Souvenirs?
- When l was sick.

10
00:00:55,447 --> 00:00:57,244
- Are you all right?
- l'm all right.

11
00:00:57,447 --> 00:01:01,122
They were my favourite sexual organs.
Tongues.

12
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,961
Where are the girls?

13
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:05,996
Close.

14
00:01:06,207 --> 00:01:08,516
But you have to give me
something in return for them.

15
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:10,643
The only thing you're gonna get
is your last meal.

16
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:14,157
- Take that animal back to death row.
- What about the victims' families?

17
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:15,800
l'm their last chance for closure.

18
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:17,679
- What is it you want?
- Not much.

19
00:01:18,527 --> 00:01:19,960
Just the man who put me in these.

20
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:25,321
NClS Special Agent
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

21
00:02:08,687 --> 00:02:10,757
l will never forget the day
Gibbs caught this psycho.

22
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:14,118
You knew Gibbs back then?

23
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:17,883
No. l was a junior at Georgetown
and for two years,

24
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:20,237
every woman in D.C.
was afraid to go out at night.

25
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:23,200
- That must have been tough.
- Yeah. You have no idea.

26
00:02:23,407 --> 00:02:26,843
l actually owe Gibbs for the first
full night of sleep l got in college.

27
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,083
l meant dating.

28
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:32,961
Yes. Yes. Dating was tough.

29
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:35,920
- Need any help with that now, Paula?
- No, Tony. Thank you.

30
00:02:36,127 --> 00:02:39,676
l've been there and l've done that.

31
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:42,447
Your problem with women
is where you're focused.

32
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:44,763
Where?

33
00:02:48,247 --> 00:02:50,477
Here. lt's a mirror.

34
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:53,280
Quick question.

35
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:55,876
The pink ones, do they taste
like Strawberry Starburst?

36
00:02:56,087 --> 00:02:59,762
- l thought you weren't seeing anyone.
- l'm not.

37
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:03,802
- lt's for my complexion.
- Complexion got a name?

38
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:07,157
Tony, you so don't wanna go there.

39
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:11,676
Tell me it's not another agent
because l don't think l--

40
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:16,684
His name's Bob and he's a lawyer.

41
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:18,957
What a coincidence.
l hate lawyers.

42
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:23,206
l know. So do l. That's why
it's purely a sexual relationship.

43
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:25,204
Well, what would that make me?

44
00:03:25,407 --> 00:03:29,956
A big mistake. lf you do not give me
by birth control pills,

45
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:31,759
l'm going to break your arm.

46
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,205
Got that coffee.

47
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:38,524
- Have you been there long?
- Long enough to say: ''No, ma'am.''

48
00:03:38,727 --> 00:03:41,161
- Agent Cassidy.
- Okay. Good answer.

49
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:44,364
Thank you.

50
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:47,921
l let her do that.

51
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,446
Thank you.

52
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:51,800
Who's that?

53
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:56,005
- Kyle Boone.
- He's an infamous serial killer, probie.

54
00:03:56,207 --> 00:03:57,959
Terrorized the District in the '90s.
Come on.

55
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,761
Twenty-two women went missing
and five bodies were found.

56
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:02,923
Guy only made one mistake.

57
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:05,118
He killed a petty officer.

58
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:06,885
- Gibbs caught him?
- He's scheduled

59
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,322
for a government-sanctioned
dirt-nap on Saturday.

60
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:12,325
He wants to talk to Gibbs
before they flip the switch.

61
00:04:12,527 --> 00:04:13,960
- Why?
- Claims he's gonna tell him

62
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:18,086
- where the bodies are.
- What is that doing on my screen?

63
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:21,802
- l didn't put it there, boss.
- Who did, McGee?

64
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:24,362
Probie, let me handle this.

65
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:26,205
Boss.

66
00:04:27,207 --> 00:04:28,879
She did it.

67
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:33,245
We heard you were interviewing

68
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:38,205
Kyle Boone and we assumed
we would be providing backup.

69
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:41,001
You heard wrong, Cassidy.
l'm not interviewing anyone.

70
00:04:41,207 --> 00:04:43,437
Then you might wanna let
the governor of Virginia know.

71
00:04:43,607 --> 00:04:46,565
Since MTAC has him standing by
waiting for your call.

72
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:52,682
Find her a desk.

73
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:54,878
- ls that one?
- No, it's taken.

74
00:04:57,247 --> 00:05:00,717
A whole week of TAD with Gibbs.
l can smell the fun already.

75
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:02,360
Well, it's been a tough month.

76
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:04,717
Right now he pretty much
hates everyone, Paula.

77
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:07,478
lncluding himself.

78
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:10,599
<i>l was told by your director that you</i>
<i>would personally be interviewing</i>

79
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:12,803
<i>Kyle Boone this afternoon,</i>
<i>Agent Gibbs.</i>

80
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:15,316
Director Shepard was misinformed,
governor.

81
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:17,722
Talking to Kyle Boone
would be a waste of time.

82
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:20,725
<i>Possibly. But if there's even a chance</i>
<i>that he would reveal to you</i>

83
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,878
<i>the location of his victims,</i>
<i>we have to take it.</i>

84
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:24,275
l disagree, sir.

85
00:05:24,487 --> 00:05:27,365
He's had ten years to think about it.
Why the change of heart now?

86
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:32,197
<i>ln my experience, men facing</i>
<i>imminent death tend to re-evaluate</i>

87
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:34,398
<i>the course of their lives.</i>

88
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,326
<i>Most seek forgiveness.</i>

89
00:05:36,527 --> 00:05:38,882
You trust me, sir.
Boone had a lot of interests.

90
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:43,075
Forgiveness wasn't one of them.

91
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:46,360
- <i>How can you be so sure?</i>
- l spent five months interrogating him.

92
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:48,523
<i>A decade ago. People change.</i>

93
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:51,560
People, sir. Maybe.

94
00:05:52,447 --> 00:05:53,766
Not Kyle Boone.

95
00:05:55,447 --> 00:05:57,961
- <i>Are you refusing to meet with him?</i>
- l'm refusing to entertain

96
00:05:58,127 --> 00:06:02,166
a homicidal maniac who tortured
and killed 22 women, sir.

97
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:05,040
l have played that game before.

98
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:08,956
<i>The hundreds of family members who</i>
<i>lost a daughter, a sister or a mother?</i>

99
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:11,727
- <i>What do l tell them?</i>
- That no matter what Kyle Boone says

100
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:17,280
in the next few days, come Saturday,
sir, you're gonna make sure he fries.

101
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:21,244
<i>We all owe you a debt of gratitude</i>
<i>for bringing him to justice, Gibbs.</i>

102
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,723
<i>But you leave me little choice.</i>

103
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:27,996
<i>l am sorry.</i>

104
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:36,197
We've got a high-priority transmission
coming through for you in MTAC.

105
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:39,558
- From who?
- The secretary of the Navy.

106
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:53,236
- Well, look on the bright side.
- What is the bright side?

107
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:56,279
You're only here a week.

108
00:06:56,567 --> 00:07:01,118
- Why couldn't l sit at Kate's desk?
- Mostly because it's still Kate's desk.

109
00:07:01,327 --> 00:07:03,318
She was a great agent.

110
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:05,199
Yeah.

111
00:07:05,887 --> 00:07:09,038
- How are you handling it?
- Same way l handle everything.

112
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:11,203
l try not to think about it.

113
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:15,002
- And when that doesn't work?
- There's always junk food.

114
00:07:15,287 --> 00:07:16,879
lt doesn't sound very healthy, Tony.

115
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:19,681
lt's either that or l start building a boat
in my basement.

116
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:23,880
- Did you move from your apartment?
- No. Now you see my dilemma.

117
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:27,796
Hey, if you ever do wanna talk about it,
l'm here for you.

118
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:29,840
Okay?

119
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:33,839
- You mean that?
- Yes, of course l mean that.

120
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:40,080
Okay.
Well, then let me ask you something.

121
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:42,846
What's Bobby like in bed?

122
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:49,677
Kate was right.
You are truly, truly pathetic, DiNozzo.

123
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:51,715
You two might wanna get busy.

124
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:54,481
Gibbs is headed this way
and he looks pissed.

125
00:07:54,687 --> 00:07:56,359
- Think he caved to the governor?
- No way.

126
00:07:56,527 --> 00:07:58,802
No way. lf Gibbs doesn't wanna do
something he doesn't.

127
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:00,923
No matter who's asking.

128
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:07,238
- Where you going, boss?
- Sussex State Prison

129
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:08,681
to interview Kyle Boone.

130
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:10,798
Be gone the rest of the day.

131
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,475
Yep, you two sure have him pegged.

132
00:08:14,087 --> 00:08:16,396
We moved Boone to death watch
on Monday.

133
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:18,245
That's when he decided
he wanted to talk.

134
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:20,483
We do things a little different here
in Virginia.

135
00:08:20,687 --> 00:08:22,120
The condemned get a choice:

136
00:08:22,807 --> 00:08:24,559
Lethal injection
or death by electrocution.

137
00:08:24,807 --> 00:08:26,718
Boone is the first one
to choose the chair.

138
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:29,157
- He deserves the worse.
- Special Agent Gibbs?

139
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:31,039
l'm Adam O'Neill,
Kyle Boone's attorney.

140
00:08:31,207 --> 00:08:32,526
l really appreciate your coming.

141
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:37,438
l understand your reluctance here.

142
00:08:38,007 --> 00:08:40,919
But l truly believe
that my client's intentions are sincere.

143
00:08:41,127 --> 00:08:42,321
The day l arrested your client,

144
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:45,399
we found two human female tongues
in his refrigerator.

145
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:48,679
- l'm familiar with the case.
- Are you familiar with his victims?

146
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:50,439
Look, l'm not here
to talk about the past.

147
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:53,036
- l'm here trying to save a man's life.
- Boone wants a deal?

148
00:08:53,207 --> 00:08:56,324
No. Mr. Boone wants the chair
for his crimes.

149
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:59,564
l'm the one hoping
to get him life in prison.

150
00:09:01,527 --> 00:09:02,846
Good luck with that.

151
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:04,760
Agent Gibbs, please!

152
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,725
l'm just trying to do my job here.

153
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:13,001
Maybe together we can both help
the victims' families find some closure.

154
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:14,886
Be there Saturday.

155
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,999
- You'll be able to see them get that.
- Right this way, gentlemen.

156
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:20,118
Well, actually, against my advice

157
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:24,437
Mr. Boone has elected to meet
with Agent Gibbs, alone.

158
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,603
There will be a guard out here
if you need him.

159
00:09:27,887 --> 00:09:29,479
l won't.

160
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:38,565
Nice to see you again, Jethro.

161
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:42,598
l wasn't sure if you'd come,
but here you are.

162
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:47,163
You've got two minutes.
Start talking.

163
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,605
You know,

164
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:51,684
you look almost the same.

165
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:55,797
Except the hair.
When did it go grey?

166
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:57,156
Where are the bodies?

167
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:59,403
We'll get to that.

168
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:01,837
There's just a few things l need
to ask you first.

169
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:04,766
l guess they showed you
my souvenirs?

170
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:08,516
- There weren't 20 in that jar.
- Your point?

171
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:11,082
l always thought you were padding
your count.

172
00:10:11,847 --> 00:10:14,407
Baiting me?
Denigrating my rep?

173
00:10:14,607 --> 00:10:17,246
Come on. You know that approach
never worked on me, Jethro.

174
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:21,076
- A minute thirty-eight.
- Can't we just chat for a bit?

175
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,879
Catch up?

176
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:26,837
How's the wife?

177
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:31,405
She left you, didn't she?

178
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:33,478
l tried to warn you about that.

179
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:35,279
Women can't understand men
like us.

180
00:10:35,487 --> 00:10:36,602
You've got what, Boone?

181
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:37,956
Three days left?

182
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:39,965
How's it feel?

183
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:46,402
l'm kind of terrified. Weird,
considering my former activities.

184
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:50,161
They say it can take
up to four minutes to die in the chair.

185
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:54,519
Me, personally?
l'm hoping it takes a lot longer.

186
00:10:55,607 --> 00:10:57,165
You really have changed.

187
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,602
The old Gibbs would never be
this abrupt.

188
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:01,480
Did you remarry?

189
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,596
- You've got less than a minute.
- Okay. Okay. Too personal.

190
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:10,323
And what about NClS Special Agent
Caitlin Todd? Can we talk about her?

191
00:11:10,527 --> 00:11:15,157
l saw her picture in <i>The Post</i>.
They said she was shot by a terrorist?

192
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:20,164
Did you cut back on the caffeine
like l told you?

193
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,485
See you Saturday.

194
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:25,724
Come on, Gibbs.
l was just having some fun with you.

195
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:27,155
You can't leave.

196
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,961
You're here because you're following
orders like a good Marine.

197
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:31,441
Right, Gunny?

198
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:34,525
l'll tell you where they are.
Where they all are.

199
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,560
There's more than 22, Jethro.

200
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:39,764
Lots more.

201
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:52,197
- Where is he, Timothy?
- Who?

202
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,358
Gibbs, damn it.

203
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:58,686
Hey.

204
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:03,203
Do you know the difference between
good and bad cholesterol, Tony?

205
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:05,881
No, but l'm assuming
it has something to do with taste.

206
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:08,925
Bad is what came back
on your last blood test.

207
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:10,799
- Dispose of this.
- Hey, hey, hey.

208
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:14,721
- That cost me 1 6 bucks, that pizza.
- You'll thank me when you're my age.

209
00:12:14,887 --> 00:12:16,639
But you eat pizza all the time.

210
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:18,877
- Exactly.
- l don't see the connection here.

211
00:12:19,047 --> 00:12:21,800
Well, of course you wouldn't.
You're not a doctor.

212
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:25,322
- Where is Gibbs?
- Sussex State Prison.

213
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:26,801
lnterviewing Kyle Boone.

214
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,321
He said he wasn't going.

215
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:31,479
- He wasn't.
- Until the SECNAV ordered him to.

216
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:33,717
- Who's with him?
- No one.

217
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:36,277
Have you any idea the effect that
psychopath had

218
00:12:36,447 --> 00:12:37,926
on Gibbs ten years ago?

219
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:41,603
Considering how open Gibbs is about
his personal life, no, not a clue.

220
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:44,203
He should not have gone alone.

221
00:12:44,887 --> 00:12:46,684
Ducky, it's Gibbs.
l'm sure he'll be fine.

222
00:12:47,207 --> 00:12:50,882
lt's easy for you to say. You didn't have
to live through this the last time.

223
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:54,201
- DiNozzo.
- <i>Get the truck.</i>

224
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,523
- Where?
- <i>Boone Farm. Bring Cassidy.</i>

225
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:58,400
Yeah, l got it, boss.

226
00:12:58,607 --> 00:13:01,246
We're on our way. Cassidy, saddle up.
Gibbs wants you in the field.

227
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:03,602
- Boone family farm.
- Wants me?

228
00:13:03,807 --> 00:13:05,559
That's what he said.
Let's roll.

229
00:13:05,727 --> 00:13:07,683
The difference between ten years ago
and today?

230
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:11,801
- We have Gibbs back.
- There's another difference, Tony.

231
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:15,363
Ten years ago, Gibbs
was a very different man.

232
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:17,876
- You mean he was actually meaner?
- Oh, quite the opposite.

233
00:13:19,047 --> 00:13:20,446
He was--

234
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:23,961
He was a lot like you.

235
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,841
What do we got?

236
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:40,441
l can save you the time, Gibbs.

237
00:13:40,607 --> 00:13:43,201
- My measurements are 34--
- Twenty-six, 34.

238
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:46,037
A hundred and twenty pounds?
l'm right, aren't l?

239
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:49,085
Did you weigh and measure me
in my sleep?

240
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:52,205
l'm a crime scene sketch expert.
lt's what l do.

241
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:54,085
- You'll do.
- Gibbs, again.

242
00:13:54,247 --> 00:13:56,317
You have such a way
of making a gal feel so special.

243
00:13:56,527 --> 00:13:57,846
Put this on.

244
00:13:58,007 --> 00:13:58,996
- McGee?
- Yeah, boss?

245
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,317
You might wanna wear kneepads.

246
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:07,961
- Do we even have kneepads?
- Equipment inventory is Kate's job.

247
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,560
You might wanna ask--

248
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:18,999
Do you know
what the hell we're doing?

249
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:21,721
- Following Gibbs' lead?
- On what?

250
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,246
- l don't know.
- You don't know

251
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:27,241
- and that doesn't bother you at all?
- You get used to it.

252
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:29,045
Yeah, that's what l'm afraid of.

253
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:35,639
This place must have been gone
over a dozen times, boss.

254
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:38,799
- No way there's any bodies in here.
- l'm not looking for bodies, Tony.

255
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:42,240
Boone was raised here by his uncle.
His mother was a prostitute.

256
00:14:42,407 --> 00:14:43,965
She left town when he was 1 2.

257
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,521
Then what are we looking for?

258
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:48,200
Proof. Boone swears it's here.

259
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:51,484
The only place we didn't look is inside
this chimney.

260
00:14:52,127 --> 00:14:54,482
l think l got something.
No.

261
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:56,120
That's just another dead bird.

262
00:14:58,367 --> 00:14:59,482
Oh, that's disgusting.

263
00:14:59,687 --> 00:15:03,362
l'll bet this wasn't in the brochure
when you signed up for NClS, probie.

264
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:05,478
- You know, you were wrong earlier.
- About what?

265
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:07,365
She weighs more than a buck twenty.

266
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:10,680
Sorry.

267
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,077
- She did that on purpose.
- Okay. Oh, no. l got--

268
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,124
lt's right here by the flue.
l got it.

269
00:15:15,327 --> 00:15:17,079
- Okay. l got it. l'm coming down.
- Finally.

270
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:20,165
You could have taken your boots--
Oh, jeez.

271
00:15:20,407 --> 00:15:22,045
My bad.

272
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:25,077
Looks like a book.

273
00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:48,800
Oh, there must be 30 pages there.

274
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:50,645
More.

275
00:15:51,887 --> 00:15:54,242
What's carved into their backs?

276
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,478
That's his calling card, McGee.

277
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:03,161
Something wrong?

278
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,999
This section on my mother,
John, is better.

279
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:09,080
- But it still needs work.
- l was trying to humanize her, Kyle.

280
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:11,000
Don't.

281
00:16:12,607 --> 00:16:14,279
You find it all right, Jethro?

282
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:16,685
l guess you wouldn't be here
if you didn't.

283
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:19,566
l don't believe you've met
my biographer, John Briggs.

284
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:21,877
Special Agent Gibbs, it is a pleasure.

285
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,436
l've been trying to schedule
an interview with you for months.

286
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:26,086
You're gonna have to leave now,
Briggs.

287
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:29,319
l've been granted special permission
by the State of Virginia to be here.

288
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:31,319
- Not anymore.
- Next time you see Boone,

289
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,398
he'll have a thunderbolt shooting out
of his ass.

290
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:37,196
Hey, l was guaranteed full access
for the next three days.

291
00:16:37,407 --> 00:16:39,398
The warden asked you to leave.

292
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:41,239
Don't make him ask you again.

293
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:43,244
You'll have to excuse Agent Gibbs,
John.

294
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:46,445
He's finally gotten a glimpse into
the world l've been telling him about.

295
00:16:46,687 --> 00:16:48,325
The scrapbook?

296
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:50,882
You found his scrapbook?
When will it be released?

297
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:53,243
Son, if you wanna walk out of here
under your own power

298
00:16:53,407 --> 00:16:55,637
l suggest you leave now.

299
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:05,798
John really is a wonderful writer.

300
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,641
You know, he spent years trying
to understand me.

301
00:17:08,887 --> 00:17:11,401
Unfortunately, he just never seemed
to measure up.

302
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:13,205
To who?

303
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,045
Your prostitute mom?

304
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:19,479
Or your father? Some hick john
with a few extra bucks in his pocket?

305
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:22,081
Actually, l was referring to you, Jethro.

306
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:25,315
Show's over.
Where is the dumping ground?

307
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:27,319
You show me my scrapbook
one last time

308
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:30,041
and l'll draw you a map
even a Marine can follow.

309
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:32,920
No. They've suffered enough.

310
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:34,719
Well, we're at an impasse.

311
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:37,441
You gonna keep playing
this game with me, Boone?

312
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:42,276
l have never considered
any of this a game, Jethro.

313
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:45,246
- You know that.
- Whatever. l'm changing the rules.

314
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:47,199
- How so?
- l've seen your world.

315
00:17:48,727 --> 00:17:51,878
Now you're gonna spend what's left
of your miserable life in mine.

316
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,203
All right, listen up,
my probationary field agents.

317
00:18:04,447 --> 00:18:07,280
You are about to witness the transfer
of a maximum-security prisoner

318
00:18:07,447 --> 00:18:08,436
to our humble facility.

319
00:18:08,607 --> 00:18:11,167
While he's here,
he's our sole responsibility.

320
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,356
- Oh, l'm sorry. Am l boring you?
- My God, does he ever stop?

321
00:18:15,607 --> 00:18:17,757
l'm just glad it's not me.

322
00:18:18,207 --> 00:18:21,722
lt's 1 0:00. lt doesn't make sense
bringing Boone here now.

323
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:24,117
Gibbs is trying to put him
on unfamiliar ground.

324
00:18:24,327 --> 00:18:27,125
- Throw him off balance.
- Because that worked ten years ago?

325
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:30,202
- What's different now?
- l am, Cassidy.

326
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:33,404
Stand tall.
Wake up, probies.

327
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:50,400
l knew l could
count on you, Jethro.

328
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,523
lt's good to be home again.

329
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:03,006
Yep, good to be home.

330
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:10,037
The guy's been impersonating
a statue all night.

331
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,437
According to the watch,
he hasn't moved a muscle.

332
00:19:13,207 --> 00:19:14,196
He's creepy.

333
00:19:14,407 --> 00:19:17,399
When is Gibbs gonna start
his interrogation?

334
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:19,956
- When he's ready.
- You might wanna tell him to hurry.

335
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:24,006
He's got less than 48 hours before
Boone's scheduled to be executed.

336
00:19:24,807 --> 00:19:27,037
l've got a better idea, Paula.

337
00:19:27,247 --> 00:19:28,566
Why don't you tell him?

338
00:19:29,727 --> 00:19:31,638
Because l'm not stupid.

339
00:19:31,807 --> 00:19:33,081
No.

340
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,358
Of all the things you are,

341
00:19:35,647 --> 00:19:37,603
stupid definitely isn't one of them.

342
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:40,920
Thank you.

343
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:43,317
- Okay, what's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

344
00:19:44,127 --> 00:19:48,359
- By the way, how's Bobert?
- Why, are you jealous?

345
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:50,845
Of a lawyer?
Give me a break.

346
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:53,282
- He's very rich.
- Money isn't everything.

347
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:55,438
He's got season tickets
to the Redskins.

348
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:58,036
- Private skybox.
- l'm happy for him.

349
00:19:58,207 --> 00:19:59,560
And l almost forgot

350
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:03,006
he drives a Ferrari.

351
00:20:04,807 --> 00:20:06,525
Red.

352
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:09,078
Like Magnum.

353
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,482
Well, that's nice.

354
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:13,605
lsn't it?

355
00:20:13,807 --> 00:20:16,116
You know what's even nicer?

356
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:17,920
My current view.

357
00:20:18,127 --> 00:20:20,595
Victoria's Secret?
Agent Cassidy.

358
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:23,486
Well, you enjoy it as long as you can,
Agent DiNozzo

359
00:20:23,647 --> 00:20:25,877
because that's as close
as you're gonna get.

360
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,156
Cassidy?

361
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:32,198
Check Boone's security detail.

362
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:34,358
You got it.

363
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:36,916
- l'll give her a hand with that.
- Wait.

364
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:45,719
- What was that for?
- Letting her get to you.

365
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:47,525
Boss, l was not letting her get--

366
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,997
l won't let it happen again.

367
00:20:52,847 --> 00:20:55,805
- Thanks.
- lt's for Abby.

368
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:59,403
Go find out how many victims
she lD'd from Boone's scrapbook.

369
00:21:23,447 --> 00:21:25,915
There were 27 women
in the scrapbook, McGee.

370
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:28,555
As far as l can tell, they're in the order
that they were killed.

371
00:21:28,727 --> 00:21:31,036
Now, Boone has admitted
to killing 22

372
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:34,842
which matches with the photos
in the files that the FBl sent over.

373
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:38,079
Which would make you think
that we'd be left with five Jane Does,

374
00:21:38,287 --> 00:21:42,997
but you'd be wrong because l know
who the first victim is.

375
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:45,923
You're not listening
to a word l'm saying.

376
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:48,838
l'm pregnant, McGee.

377
00:21:49,327 --> 00:21:50,521
Twins.

378
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,604
Haven't told the father yet.

379
00:21:53,287 --> 00:21:55,847
lt's Gibbs. l know it's wrong

380
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:58,800
but something about his silver hair
just gets me all tingly inside.

381
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:00,764
Excuse me for a sec.
l think l'm gonna vomit.

382
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:02,679
l'm joking, Tony.

383
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:04,678
Except for the part about Gibbs' hair.

384
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:06,605
That is really hot.

385
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:09,565
- McGee is ignoring me again.
- Easily fixable.

386
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:12,835
- What? What'd l do?
- Stop ignoring Abby. She's sensitive.

387
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:14,241
l'm sorry. l was concentrating.

388
00:22:14,407 --> 00:22:16,398
l think that l know how we can find
Boone's victims

389
00:22:16,607 --> 00:22:18,040
without Gibbs having to talk to him.

390
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:21,085
There are distinctive geographical
and man-made features

391
00:22:21,287 --> 00:22:22,436
in several of these pictures.

392
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:25,605
Here's a stream
and what may be a bridge.

393
00:22:25,807 --> 00:22:28,719
Up here appears to be a power line.

394
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:30,804
Or some dirt on a picture.

395
00:22:31,007 --> 00:22:34,079
lf l can make a land plot, create scale
by computing the distances

396
00:22:34,247 --> 00:22:37,922
- between these points, then we can--
- Okay, streams and power lines?

397
00:22:38,127 --> 00:22:41,085
lt would take years searching just one
county, McGee. Never mind a state.

398
00:22:41,247 --> 00:22:43,363
Yeah, for us, Tony.
But not for a computer.

399
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:45,717
Satellite imagery?
l should have thought of that.

400
00:22:45,887 --> 00:22:48,355
l need to figure a way
to calculate an accurate scale.

401
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,239
Polaroid cameras have
a fixed focal length.

402
00:22:50,407 --> 00:22:52,637
That's a good start. l'm gonna need
one known measurement.

403
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:55,924
- Pick one body and l'll pull her stats.
- Three known vectors should do it.

404
00:22:56,087 --> 00:22:57,918
Okay. Okay.
Enough with the geek-speak.

405
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,004
Gibbs wants to know how
many victims we lD'd.

406
00:23:00,207 --> 00:23:02,801
All except for the last four
in the scrapbook.

407
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,237
We're running them
against missing persons reports

408
00:23:05,407 --> 00:23:08,001
prior to Gibbs putting Boone
behind bars. No matches yet.

409
00:23:08,207 --> 00:23:11,483
The one that stands out the most
is the first victim.

410
00:23:11,687 --> 00:23:14,121
She disappeared in 1 97 4.

411
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,204
Are you sure about that, Abs?

412
00:23:16,407 --> 00:23:18,079
Boone was just a kid back then.

413
00:23:18,287 --> 00:23:21,802
l know. And it turns out his mother
did not abandon him.

414
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:24,885
She was his first kill.

415
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:36,119
You don't have to do this again,
you know.

416
00:23:37,527 --> 00:23:38,880
You're wrong, Duck. l do.

417
00:23:40,007 --> 00:23:42,521
He's never gonna tell you
where those poor girls are.

418
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:45,565
- l know that.
- Then why?

419
00:23:47,047 --> 00:23:49,481
Because ten years ago
l couldn't break him.

420
00:23:49,727 --> 00:23:51,683
No, but you did
what no one else could.

421
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:54,765
- You caught the son of a bitch.
- l should have killed him.

422
00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:58,079
And in two days that will be rectified.

423
00:23:58,967 --> 00:24:01,356
l'm telling you as a friend.

424
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,837
lt's time to let this one go.

425
00:24:04,047 --> 00:24:05,241
Not yet, Ducky.

426
00:24:05,447 --> 00:24:08,166
You already lost one relationship
as a result of this case.

427
00:24:08,327 --> 00:24:09,646
She was a wonderful girl.

428
00:24:09,887 --> 00:24:13,562
- And you neglected--
- She left me, Duck. l didn't leave her.

429
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:17,442
No.
You made it impossible for her to stay.

430
00:24:21,887 --> 00:24:24,685
Okay, send him up.
Make sure he's escorted.

431
00:24:24,887 --> 00:24:26,400
l'll let Gibbs know.

432
00:24:28,327 --> 00:24:29,726
Comfortable?

433
00:24:30,087 --> 00:24:32,920
- Yeah, as a matter of fact--
- lt was a rhetorical question, lady.

434
00:24:33,127 --> 00:24:36,164
Wow, l never realized how sensitive
you were about your desk.

435
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:38,278
There's a lot about me
you don't realise, Cassidy.

436
00:24:38,447 --> 00:24:40,403
- Where's Gibbs?
- lnterrogation.

437
00:24:40,607 --> 00:24:42,643
Boone's lawyer is here.
He claims he wasn't notified

438
00:24:42,847 --> 00:24:45,407
about his client's being moved
and he wants to talk to him.

439
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,717
Gibbs doesn't like to be kept waiting.

440
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:49,479
You better go right in there

441
00:24:50,007 --> 00:24:52,919
and tell him yourself. l'll get the suit.

442
00:24:56,927 --> 00:24:58,599
Finally.

443
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:01,437
So where should we start this time,
Jethro?

444
00:25:01,647 --> 00:25:02,841
My childhood?

445
00:25:03,047 --> 00:25:05,356
l didn't bring you in here to talk, Boone.

446
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:08,206
So you decided to let me see
my photographs again?

447
00:25:08,447 --> 00:25:10,642
l told you that's not gonna happen.

448
00:25:10,847 --> 00:25:13,645
lnteresting.
May l ask why l'm here then?

449
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:17,078
The state is hoping
that l'll get the location of your victims.

450
00:25:17,287 --> 00:25:19,517
l believe that requires some form
of communication.

451
00:25:19,687 --> 00:25:22,599
l said the state. Me?

452
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:24,316
l'm not even gonna try.

453
00:25:24,527 --> 00:25:27,724
But you always try, Jethro.
That's why l like you.

454
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:30,361
l've taken you out of the system,
Boone.

455
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:34,401
You're gonna sit here, alone, without
any human contact until you fry.

456
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:36,040
The game ends now.

457
00:25:38,207 --> 00:25:42,644
This room brings back
so many memories, doesn't it?

458
00:25:44,527 --> 00:25:46,518
Special Agent Gibbs, a word please?

459
00:25:46,727 --> 00:25:48,763
Sounds like you replaced
your dead female.

460
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,438
Any chance l can meet this one?

461
00:25:57,407 --> 00:25:59,716
Well, l'll be here if you need me.

462
00:26:03,007 --> 00:26:04,884
- What?
- Boone's attorney is here.

463
00:26:05,087 --> 00:26:08,045
The DA's afraid if we deny him access,
he'll find a sympathetic judge

464
00:26:08,207 --> 00:26:10,516
- and have the execution delayed.
- l got it.

465
00:26:11,327 --> 00:26:14,478
Look, l need a privileged conversation
with my client.

466
00:26:14,687 --> 00:26:17,155
Meaning, Agent Gibbs,
l want your observation room cleared

467
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,966
and all microphones turned off.

468
00:26:20,127 --> 00:26:23,324
- That's it, counsellor?
- For now, agent.

469
00:26:23,807 --> 00:26:24,922
Tony?

470
00:26:25,847 --> 00:26:30,523
- Yeah, hold on a second.
- Search him first thoroughly.

471
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:39,960
l'm impressed.

472
00:26:40,407 --> 00:26:42,762
- lt's actually working.
- Thank you.

473
00:26:43,287 --> 00:26:45,755
Now all we have to do is scan
through 800,000 miles

474
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:48,003
of satellite imagery,
and pray we get lucky.

475
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:50,920
l am a scientist, McGee.

476
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:53,601
Luck has nothing to do with it
and/or us.

477
00:26:54,607 --> 00:26:57,724
Okay, then how do you explain
something like Gibbs' gut?

478
00:26:57,927 --> 00:27:00,839
Well, that's easy. Gibbs is lucky.

479
00:27:01,047 --> 00:27:04,642
- But you just said that--
- He's not a scientist.

480
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:08,561
Agent Gibbs,

481
00:27:08,767 --> 00:27:10,678
if anything happens to my client while
he's here,

482
00:27:10,847 --> 00:27:13,281
l want you to know l am gonna hold
you personally responsible--

483
00:27:13,447 --> 00:27:16,644
You have my word he will be
in perfect health for his execution.

484
00:27:17,647 --> 00:27:21,322
Escort Mr. O'Neill out of my building,
Special Agent Cassidy.

485
00:27:21,527 --> 00:27:23,165
You'll be hearing from me.

486
00:27:23,407 --> 00:27:24,920
Let's go.

487
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:27,358
You going back in there, boss?

488
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:29,958
Yeah, maybe. Gibbs.

489
00:27:30,327 --> 00:27:31,316
<i>Gibbs, it's Abby.</i>

490
00:27:31,487 --> 00:27:33,079
<i>We think we found Boone's</i>
<i>dumping ground.</i>

491
00:27:33,247 --> 00:27:35,966
<i>We've got it on a screen in my lab.</i>

492
00:27:36,127 --> 00:27:38,482
They think they may have found
his dumping ground.

493
00:27:41,447 --> 00:27:44,519
- What am l looking at?
- Take it away, McGee.

494
00:27:48,447 --> 00:27:51,644
l mean, very Special Agent McGee.

495
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:55,965
Probable site where the victims
were tortured, killed, perhaps buried.

496
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:58,280
- You wanna know how?
- Not really.

497
00:27:58,487 --> 00:28:00,284
Good, because it was mostly luck.

498
00:28:00,487 --> 00:28:02,796
Where? Wilderness area
at Great Falls National Park.

499
00:28:03,007 --> 00:28:05,123
- Tony, you lead the team.
- Where are you going, boss?

500
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:07,198
After ten years, l finally got something
on Boone

501
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:08,925
he doesn't already know about.

502
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:11,598
My lawyer was very upset.

503
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:14,844
He wanted to move me back to prison.
But don't worry.

504
00:28:15,047 --> 00:28:17,880
- l told him l like it here.
- Don't get too comfortable.

505
00:28:18,127 --> 00:28:19,606
You're going back today.

506
00:28:19,807 --> 00:28:21,718
Really? What's changed?

507
00:28:22,527 --> 00:28:24,757
You found something, didn't you?

508
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:38,956
The site where the photos were taken
is 265 feet

509
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:42,284
on a track of 31 0 degrees.
We need to get through here.

510
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:45,486
Okay.

511
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,406
Remember what l told you
about the poison ivy, all right?

512
00:28:48,607 --> 00:28:50,723
- Don't tell Cassidy.
- What?

513
00:28:50,927 --> 00:28:52,485
Nothing.

514
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:54,325
Follow me.

515
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:01,597
l'm okay. l'm okay.

516
00:29:02,327 --> 00:29:05,603
This is steep.
Watch yourselves.

517
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,357
Well, if this is the place
l can see why Boone picked it.

518
00:29:16,607 --> 00:29:20,236
Off the beaten path,
no hard surfaces to reflect sound.

519
00:29:20,447 --> 00:29:23,245
Those girls could scream
their heads off and no one would hear.

520
00:29:23,607 --> 00:29:25,996
Yeah, this is the perfect spot.

521
00:30:04,447 --> 00:30:05,562
Guys,

522
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:07,121
we're in the right place.

523
00:30:13,047 --> 00:30:15,880
No reception.
Spread out, tape it off.

524
00:30:16,127 --> 00:30:18,402
We'll hike back and call Gibbs.

525
00:30:21,007 --> 00:30:23,521
Come on, Jethro.

526
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:27,041
We both know you're in there.

527
00:30:31,087 --> 00:30:33,396
- Hey.
- Hey.

528
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:35,639
- What are you doing here?
- l wanted to see

529
00:30:35,807 --> 00:30:37,081
what the monster looks like.

530
00:30:42,847 --> 00:30:44,838
He doesn't look that scary.

531
00:30:46,647 --> 00:30:48,603
You saw the photographs?

532
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:50,559
Yeah.

533
00:30:57,967 --> 00:31:01,243
You did good, McGee.
l'm proud of you.

534
00:31:01,407 --> 00:31:02,999
And?

535
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:04,476
And what?

536
00:31:04,647 --> 00:31:07,161
Well, usually, you add
some kind of insult at the end.

537
00:31:07,327 --> 00:31:08,680
No, l don't.

538
00:31:08,927 --> 00:31:11,361
Well, okay, maybe sometimes.

539
00:31:11,567 --> 00:31:15,162
- But the point is, we're a team.
- Tony?

540
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:21,605
You all right?

541
00:31:21,887 --> 00:31:24,117
l was a little startled.

542
00:31:24,327 --> 00:31:25,521
By what?

543
00:31:25,727 --> 00:31:27,683
Her.

544
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:40,719
She couldn't have been dead
more than a few days.

545
00:31:42,087 --> 00:31:44,760
Tony, you're not gonna believe it.

546
00:31:45,927 --> 00:31:47,485
Boone's mark.

547
00:31:58,567 --> 00:32:01,718
l-- l can't get any reception out here.

548
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,325
That's not surprising.

549
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:06,597
Butt-nowhere isn't part
of our coverage plan.

550
00:32:06,807 --> 00:32:09,560
l'm gonna head back to the truck
and try and get the call through.

551
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:12,520
Okay, tell Gibbs we're gonna need
everything and everyone on this one.

552
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:13,961
l'll be back in 20 minutes.

553
00:32:27,847 --> 00:32:29,280
Yeah, Gibbs.

554
00:32:29,527 --> 00:32:30,721
Gibbs.

555
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:32,798
- We found Boone's dumping ground.
- <i>Good work.</i>

556
00:32:33,127 --> 00:32:35,800
- Tell Tony he needs to call--
- <i>We also found a fresh body.</i>

557
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:37,719
Female.
Dead less than a week.

558
00:32:37,887 --> 00:32:39,957
She has Boone's mark on her back.

559
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:43,045
l think we're definitely dealing
with a copycat killer.

560
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:47,642
- Gibbs? Gibbs, can you hear me?
- Yeah, l heard you.

561
00:32:47,807 --> 00:32:49,877
l want the area sealed off.
l'm on my way.

562
00:32:57,887 --> 00:32:59,320
Tony.

563
00:33:00,287 --> 00:33:02,562
- Something's not right.
- No, nothing has been

564
00:33:02,727 --> 00:33:04,877
since Boone showed up at NClS.

565
00:33:05,047 --> 00:33:07,163
No. No, l know this girl.

566
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:10,203
You know her?
How?

567
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:13,006
You know her too. She was
the last entry in Boone's scrapbook.

568
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:14,526
One of the Jane Does.

569
00:33:15,647 --> 00:33:18,400
He's been on death row for ten years,
McGee.

570
00:33:18,607 --> 00:33:22,395
She's been here less than a week.
That's not possible.

571
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:30,726
lt can't be.

572
00:33:37,847 --> 00:33:40,042
You look a little peaked, Jethro.

573
00:33:40,247 --> 00:33:42,124
ls something wrong?

574
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:44,005
Maybe l can help.

575
00:33:44,207 --> 00:33:47,404
A new development, perhaps?

576
00:33:47,807 --> 00:33:49,035
l gotta hand it to you, Boone.

577
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,485
l did my best.

578
00:33:51,687 --> 00:33:54,121
But you got me to play your game.
Congratulations.

579
00:33:55,127 --> 00:33:57,516
You found the bodies. Good.

580
00:33:57,727 --> 00:34:00,366
Not what you were expecting,
was it?

581
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:02,398
You see, there's someone else
out there, now.

582
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:03,960
A new threat.

583
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,806
And l'm the only one
who can help you find him.

584
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:09,758
You'll have to request a stay
of my execution.

585
00:34:11,127 --> 00:34:13,561
l'm gonna have to pass on that.

586
00:34:14,727 --> 00:34:18,242
No matter how this plays out,
you're gonna sit in that chair Saturday.

587
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:21,007
You can't have changed this much.
You have a sworn duty.

588
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:22,965
Maybe. Ten years ago.

589
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:25,203
Now, hell.

590
00:34:25,407 --> 00:34:27,443
l can wait till Sunday
to start an investigation.

591
00:34:27,647 --> 00:34:30,605
- You're bluffing.
- You're dead in 36 hours.

592
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:33,560
Yeah, well, l'll be here
when you change your mind.

593
00:34:49,447 --> 00:34:51,278
Cassidy.

594
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:54,555
Cassidy.

595
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:57,000
Great. She's lost.

596
00:34:57,207 --> 00:35:00,119
Why didn't you give her
your GPS thingy, probie?

597
00:35:01,007 --> 00:35:02,281
She's not lost.

598
00:35:03,527 --> 00:35:05,040
What's going on?

599
00:35:07,007 --> 00:35:08,201
She's been kidnapped.

600
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:11,000
McGee, where is my list
of every visitor

601
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:13,237
and phone call Boone's
had since he's been in prison?

602
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:15,398
- l'm working it, boss.
- Tony?

603
00:35:17,207 --> 00:35:19,641
- Tony. Backup team's in place?
- Yeah.

604
00:35:20,447 --> 00:35:22,358
l never should have let her
take off alone, boss.

605
00:35:23,127 --> 00:35:26,961
The Polaroid of Cassidy is clean.
No prints, no DNA. l'm sorry, Gibbs.

606
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:28,924
- l screwed this thing up.
- You screwed it up?

607
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:31,078
We should have known
there was more than one killer.

608
00:35:31,247 --> 00:35:33,636
l only ran the Jane Does
up until the time Boone was captured.

609
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:35,803
All four have gone missing
the last three years.

610
00:35:36,007 --> 00:35:38,237
Concentrate on Boone's contacts
over the past three years.

611
00:35:38,407 --> 00:35:39,601
Yeah.

612
00:35:40,607 --> 00:35:41,722
We can't lose another agent.

613
00:35:42,127 --> 00:35:43,480
- l can't take this.
- Okay.

614
00:35:43,647 --> 00:35:45,603
Our best bet is a guy named
John Frederick Briggs.

615
00:35:45,767 --> 00:35:48,565
ln the last three years,
he's logged 229 phone calls

616
00:35:48,767 --> 00:35:50,200
and visited Boone
96 times.

617
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:51,595
He's writing Boone's biography.

618
00:35:51,807 --> 00:35:53,798
- He's living it.
- He's off to a good start.

619
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:55,923
Dishonourable discharge
from the Army in '91 .

620
00:35:56,127 --> 00:35:58,243
Arrested for domestic disturbance
in 2000

621
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:00,045
- for beating his girlfriend.
- Find him.

622
00:36:00,247 --> 00:36:01,726
Home address
and cell phone number.

623
00:36:01,887 --> 00:36:04,685
- Find out if his cell has a GPS locator.
- Checked the carrier.

624
00:36:04,887 --> 00:36:07,447
lt does and it can be remotely activated
if it's reported stolen.

625
00:36:07,607 --> 00:36:09,199
- Good job, McGee.
- Good job, McGee.

626
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,516
Let's roll.

627
00:36:21,007 --> 00:36:24,238
Okay, Briggs' cell provider
is relaying us his location.

628
00:36:24,447 --> 00:36:27,245
- He's in movement.
- He's headed out of D.C. on 1 90 west.

629
00:36:33,447 --> 00:36:35,039
He's getting off the 1 90 at Oakley.

630
00:36:35,247 --> 00:36:37,681
lf you get off at MacArthur,
you might make it before him.

631
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:44,721
- How far ahead is he?
- <i>Less than a mile.</i>

632
00:36:50,807 --> 00:36:52,445
That's gotta be him.

633
00:37:02,727 --> 00:37:04,365
Keep your hands on the wheel.
Keep them up.

634
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:06,520
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

635
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:08,001
Where is she, Briggs?

636
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:11,605
Okay.
Okay, l have every right to be here.

637
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:14,158
Heard from a guard
you found the bodies.

638
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,923
- l wanna see them.
- Shut up.

639
00:37:25,807 --> 00:37:27,877
Hello.

640
00:37:38,527 --> 00:37:40,040
What did you do to me?

641
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:45,079
l hit you in the head with a shovel,
my dear.

642
00:37:45,407 --> 00:37:48,046
- Did you kill that woman we found?
- l did.

643
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:52,162
How many more are there, O'Neill?

644
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:53,686
Let's see, there was...

645
00:37:53,847 --> 00:37:56,566
There was one, and then
there's two, three, four.

646
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:58,759
You will make five.

647
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:04,877
How did Boone turn his lawyer
into his replacement?

648
00:38:05,047 --> 00:38:08,960
You really think l'm Boone's lawyer
by coincidence? Come on.

649
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:12,000
See, l--
l sought Boone out.

650
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:15,475
Why?

651
00:38:15,687 --> 00:38:17,439
So l could learn from him.

652
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:19,606
Learn from the best.

653
00:38:19,807 --> 00:38:23,436
And you,
you're my graduation present.

654
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:33,955
You know, you can scream
if you want to. lt's allowed.

655
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,637
Kyle says he wants Agent Gibbs
to remember him

656
00:38:41,807 --> 00:38:44,799
for a long, long time
after he's gone.

657
00:38:45,007 --> 00:38:46,520
So you and me

658
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:50,999
we're gonna take this nice and slow.

659
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:01,002
Fighter, huh?

660
00:39:01,647 --> 00:39:03,638
l haven't had one of those before.

661
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:05,525
Try that thing again with that knife--

662
00:39:05,687 --> 00:39:08,201
You wanted to see your scrapbook?

663
00:39:08,887 --> 00:39:11,117
Where is my agent?

664
00:39:19,407 --> 00:39:21,079
Stop.

665
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:22,642
Stop--

666
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:26,039
Look, you don't know what--

667
00:39:26,287 --> 00:39:27,686
You don't know what you're doing.

668
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:32,041
- Jethro. Don't.
- Damn it.

669
00:39:33,047 --> 00:39:35,880
l don't know where she is.
How can l?

670
00:39:37,567 --> 00:39:41,321
Gibbs, please. Just let me see
them one last time. Please.

671
00:39:41,527 --> 00:39:43,006
l'm begging you.

672
00:39:43,727 --> 00:39:46,799
Where is she?

673
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:55,203
We all know
you can't destroy evidence.

674
00:39:55,407 --> 00:39:57,238
Pathetic, Jethro.

675
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:00,842
Do you really think that l need that
to see them?

676
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:04,205
When they're all up here,
anytime l want?

677
00:40:05,247 --> 00:40:06,726
Your agent is gonna suffer.

678
00:40:06,927 --> 00:40:09,646
The obscenities unleashed on her,
legendary. You know why?

679
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:13,197
Because you're the one
that stopped me. This is all your fault.

680
00:40:16,807 --> 00:40:20,686
He's cutting her tongue
out of her mouth right now.

681
00:40:21,287 --> 00:40:22,766
And you know the best part?

682
00:40:22,927 --> 00:40:24,724
After l'm gone

683
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:27,725
bodies are just gonna continue
to pile up.

684
00:40:29,007 --> 00:40:30,918
Shoot me.

685
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:35,601
You're supposed to shoot me,
you idiot!

686
00:40:35,807 --> 00:40:39,686
That the big plan you spent
ten years working on?

687
00:40:41,127 --> 00:40:45,643
Get me to murder you
and ruin my own life?

688
00:40:48,207 --> 00:40:50,198
He's carving your name
in her back right now.

689
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:53,319
Game's over.
Back to death row.

690
00:40:54,527 --> 00:40:55,562
Gibbs.

691
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,125
The governor call yet? Because they're
not gonna kill me now.

692
00:41:01,327 --> 00:41:03,477
l'm the only one
who can identify the killer.

693
00:41:04,727 --> 00:41:08,083
Do you think she screamed
when he cut out her tongue, Jethro?

694
00:41:08,247 --> 00:41:09,282
l don't know.

695
00:41:09,487 --> 00:41:11,842
Why don't you ask her yourself?

696
00:41:14,047 --> 00:41:16,561
l'm afraid your lawyer is gonna miss
your execution tomorrow.

697
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:18,797
He's kind of dead.

698
00:41:19,567 --> 00:41:21,205
Enjoy hell.

699
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:26,726
No. No! No!
