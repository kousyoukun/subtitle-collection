1
00:00:06,982 --> 00:00:09,151
-Step down.
-Go.

2
00:00:15,032 --> 00:00:17,034
Go ahead and open it up.

3
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,208
Up there.

4
00:00:36,846 --> 00:00:39,640
Tell me this has not been
just a total waste of my time, trooper.

5
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:43,436
There's something up here, sir.
l'm just not exactly sure what it is.

6
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,314
You promised us bodies.

7
00:00:47,982 --> 00:00:49,817
One thing at a time, warden.

8
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:52,820
First we start with my souvenirs.

9
00:00:53,028 --> 00:00:54,864
- Souvenirs?
- When l was sick.

10
00:00:57,408 --> 00:00:59,285
- Are you all right?
- l'm all right.

11
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:03,330
They were my favourite sexual organs.
Tongues.

12
00:01:04,957 --> 00:01:06,292
Where are the girls?

13
00:01:07,376 --> 00:01:08,419
Close.

14
00:01:08,627 --> 00:01:11,046
But you have to give me
something in return for them.

15
00:01:11,213 --> 00:01:13,257
The only thing you're gonna get
is your last meal.

16
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:16,927
- Take that animal back to death row.
- What about the victims' families?

17
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:18,637
l'm their last chance for closure.

18
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:20,598
- What is it you want?
- Not much.

19
00:01:21,474 --> 00:01:22,975
Just the man who put me in these.

20
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:28,564
NClS Special Agent
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

21
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,859
l will never forget the day
Gibbs caught this psycho.

22
00:02:15,444 --> 00:02:17,363
You knew Gibbs back then?

23
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,283
No. l was a junior at Georgetown
and for two years,

24
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:23,744
every woman in D.C.
was afraid to go out at night.

25
00:02:23,953 --> 00:02:26,831
- That must have been tough.
- Yeah. You have no idea.

26
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,626
l actually owe Gibbs for the first
full night of sleep l got in college.

27
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:32,962
l meant dating.

28
00:02:34,463 --> 00:02:37,007
Yes. Yes. Dating was tough.

29
00:02:37,216 --> 00:02:40,094
- Need any help with that now, Paula?
- No, Tony. Thank you.

30
00:02:40,302 --> 00:02:44,014
l've been there and l've done that.

31
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:46,892
Your problem with women
is where you're focused.

32
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,311
Where?

33
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,276
Here. lt's a mirror.

34
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,195
Quick question.

35
00:02:58,404 --> 00:03:00,906
The pink ones, do they taste
like Strawberry Starburst?

36
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:04,952
- l thought you weren't seeing anyone.
- l'm not.

37
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:09,165
- lt's for my complexion.
- Complexion got a name?

38
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:11,625
Tony, you so don't wanna go there.

39
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:14,253
Tell me it's not another agent
because l don't think l--

40
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,552
His name's Bob and he's a lawyer.

41
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,929
What a coincidence.
l hate lawyers.

42
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:28,350
l know. So do l. That's why
it's purely a sexual relationship.

43
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:30,436
Well, what would that make me?

44
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:34,356
A big mistake. lf you do not give me
by birth control pills,

45
00:03:34,565 --> 00:03:36,233
l'm going to break your arm.

46
00:03:38,194 --> 00:03:39,820
Got that coffee.

47
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:43,282
- Have you been there long?
- Long enough to say: ''No, ma'am.''

48
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:46,035
- Agent Cassidy.
- Okay. Good answer.

49
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:49,371
Thank you.

50
00:03:51,749 --> 00:03:53,083
l let her do that.

51
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:54,668
Thank you.

52
00:03:55,628 --> 00:03:57,129
Who's that?

53
00:03:58,422 --> 00:04:01,509
- Kyle Boone.
- He's an infamous serial killer, probie.

54
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:03,552
Terrorized the District in the '90s.
Come on.

55
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:06,472
Twenty-two women went missing
and five bodies were found.

56
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,724
Guy only made one mistake.

57
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:11,018
He killed a petty officer.

58
00:04:11,227 --> 00:04:12,853
- Gibbs caught him?
- He's scheduled

59
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,397
for a government-sanctioned
dirt-nap on Saturday.

60
00:04:15,606 --> 00:04:18,526
He wants to talk to Gibbs
before they flip the switch.

61
00:04:18,734 --> 00:04:20,236
- Why?
- Claims he's gonna tell him

62
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:24,532
- where the bodies are.
- What is that doing on my screen?

63
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,410
- l didn't put it there, boss.
- Who did, McGee?

64
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:31,080
Probie, let me handle this.

65
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:32,998
Boss.

66
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,793
She did it.

67
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:40,339
We heard you were interviewing

68
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:45,511
Kyle Boone and we assumed
we would be providing backup.

69
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,430
You heard wrong, Cassidy.
l'm not interviewing anyone.

70
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,975
Then you might wanna let
the governor of Virginia know.

71
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:54,228
Since MTAC has him standing by
waiting for your call.

72
00:04:58,315 --> 00:05:00,609
Find her a desk.

73
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,903
- ls that one?
- No, it's taken.

74
00:05:05,364 --> 00:05:08,993
A whole week of TAD with Gibbs.
l can smell the fun already.

75
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:10,703
Well, it's been a tough month.

76
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:13,164
Right now he pretty much
hates everyone, Paula.

77
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:16,041
lncluding himself.

78
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,295
<i>l was told by your director that you
would personally be interviewing</i>

79
00:05:19,462 --> 00:05:21,589
<i>Kyle Boone this afternoon,
Agent Gibbs.</i>

80
00:05:21,797 --> 00:05:24,216
Director Shepard was misinformed,
governor.

81
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,719
Talking to Kyle Boone
would be a waste of time.

82
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,847
<i>Possibly. But if there's even a chance
that he would reveal to you</i>

83
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:32,099
<i>the location of his victims,
we have to take it.</i>

84
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,559
l disagree, sir.

85
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:36,771
He's had ten years to think about it.
Why the change of heart now?

86
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:41,817
<i>ln my experience, men facing
imminent death tend to re-evaluate</i>

87
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:44,111
<i>the course of their lives.</i>

88
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,113
<i>Most seek forgiveness.</i>

89
00:05:46,322 --> 00:05:48,783
You trust me, sir.
Boone had a lot of interests.

90
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:53,162
Forgiveness wasn't one of them.

91
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:56,582
<i>- How can you be so sure?
- l spent five months interrogating him.</i>

92
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,834
<i>A decade ago. People change.</i>

93
00:05:59,043 --> 00:06:02,004
People, sir. Maybe.

94
00:06:02,922 --> 00:06:04,298
Not Kyle Boone.

95
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,677
<i>- Are you refusing to meet with him?
- l'm refusing to entertain</i>

96
00:06:08,844 --> 00:06:13,057
a homicidal maniac who tortured
and killed 22 women, sir.

97
00:06:13,265 --> 00:06:16,060
l have played that game before.

98
00:06:16,268 --> 00:06:20,147
<i>The hundreds of family members who
lost a daughter, a sister or a mother?</i>

99
00:06:20,356 --> 00:06:23,025
<i>- What do l tell them?
- That no matter what Kyle Boone says</i>

100
00:06:23,192 --> 00:06:28,823
in the next few days, come Saturday,
sir, you're gonna make sure he fries.

101
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:32,952
<i>We all owe you a debt of gratitude
for bringing him to justice, Gibbs.</i>

102
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,580
<i>But you leave me little choice.</i>

103
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:40,000
<i>l am sorry.</i>

104
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:48,551
We've got a high-priority transmission
coming through for you in MTAC.

105
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,054
- From who?
- The secretary of the Navy.

106
00:07:03,816 --> 00:07:06,318
- Well, look on the bright side.
- What is the bright side?

107
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:09,488
You're only here a week.

108
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,535
- Why couldn't l sit at Kate's desk?
- Mostly because it's still Kate's desk.

109
00:07:14,743 --> 00:07:16,829
She was a great agent.

110
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,789
Yeah.

111
00:07:19,498 --> 00:07:22,793
- How are you handling it?
- Same way l handle everything.

112
00:07:23,002 --> 00:07:25,045
l try not to think about it.

113
00:07:25,337 --> 00:07:29,008
- And when that doesn't work?
- There's always junk food.

114
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,968
lt doesn't sound very healthy, Tony.

115
00:07:31,177 --> 00:07:33,888
lt's either that or l start building a boat
in my basement.

116
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:38,267
- Did you move from your apartment?
- No. Now you see my dilemma.

117
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:42,354
Hey, if you ever do wanna talk about it,
l'm here for you.

118
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,482
Okay?

119
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:48,652
- You mean that?
- Yes, of course l mean that.

120
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:55,159
Okay.
Well, then let me ask you something.

121
00:07:56,494 --> 00:07:58,037
What's Bobby like in bed?

122
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:05,169
Kate was right.
You are truly, truly pathetic, DiNozzo.

123
00:08:06,003 --> 00:08:07,296
You two might wanna get busy.

124
00:08:07,463 --> 00:08:10,174
Gibbs is headed this way
and he looks pissed.

125
00:08:10,382 --> 00:08:12,134
- Think he caved to the governor?
- No way.

126
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:14,678
No way. lf Gibbs doesn't wanna do
something he doesn't.

127
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:16,889
No matter who's asking.

128
00:08:21,477 --> 00:08:23,479
- Where you going, boss?
- Sussex State Prison

129
00:08:23,646 --> 00:08:24,980
to interview Kyle Boone.

130
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:27,191
Be gone the rest of the day.

131
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,985
Yep, you two sure have him pegged.

132
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:33,030
We moved Boone to death watch
on Monday.

133
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,949
That's when he decided
he wanted to talk.

134
00:08:35,157 --> 00:08:37,284
We do things a little different here
in Virginia.

135
00:08:37,493 --> 00:08:38,994
The condemned get a choice:

136
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:41,539
Lethal injection
or death by electrocution.

137
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,791
Boone is the first one
to choose the chair.

138
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:46,335
- He deserves the worse.
- Special Agent Gibbs?

139
00:08:46,544 --> 00:08:48,295
l'm Adam O'Neill,
Kyle Boone's attorney.

140
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:49,839
l really appreciate your coming.

141
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:54,969
l understand your reluctance here.

142
00:08:55,553 --> 00:08:58,597
But l truly believe
that my client's intentions are sincere.

143
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,057
The day l arrested your client,

144
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:03,269
we found two human female tongues
in his refrigerator.

145
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:06,689
- l'm familiar with the case.
- Are you familiar with his victims?

146
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:08,524
Look, l'm not here
to talk about the past.

147
00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:11,235
- l'm here trying to save a man's life.
- Boone wants a deal?

148
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:14,655
No. Mr. Boone wants the chair
for his crimes.

149
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:18,033
l'm the one hoping
to get him life in prison.

150
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:21,454
Good luck with that.

151
00:09:22,037 --> 00:09:23,456
Agent Gibbs, please!

152
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:26,542
l'm just trying to do my job here.

153
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:32,047
Maybe together we can both help
the victims' families find some closure.

154
00:09:32,548 --> 00:09:34,008
Be there Saturday.

155
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:37,261
- You'll be able to see them get that.
- Right this way, gentlemen.

156
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,472
Well, actually, against my advice

157
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:43,976
Mr. Boone has elected to meet
with Agent Gibbs, alone.

158
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:46,228
There will be a guard out here
if you need him.

159
00:09:47,563 --> 00:09:49,231
l won't.

160
00:09:57,072 --> 00:09:58,699
Nice to see you again, Jethro.

161
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:02,912
l wasn't sure if you'd come,
but here you are.

162
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:07,666
You've got two minutes.
Start talking.

163
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:10,211
You know,

164
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:12,379
you look almost the same.

165
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,675
Except the hair.
When did it go grey?

166
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:18,093
Where are the bodies?

167
00:10:18,302 --> 00:10:20,429
We'll get to that.

168
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:22,973
There's just a few things l need
to ask you first.

169
00:10:23,182 --> 00:10:26,018
l guess they showed you
my souvenirs?

170
00:10:26,227 --> 00:10:29,939
- There weren't 20 in that jar.
- Your point?

171
00:10:30,147 --> 00:10:32,608
l always thought you were padding
your count.

172
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,070
Baiting me?
Denigrating my rep?

173
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:39,031
Come on. You know that approach
never worked on me, Jethro.

174
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,035
- A minute thirty-eight.
- Can't we just chat for a bit?

175
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:44,912
Catch up?

176
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:49,041
How's the wife?

177
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:53,796
She left you, didn't she?

178
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:55,965
l tried to warn you about that.

179
00:10:56,173 --> 00:10:57,842
Women can't understand men
like us.

180
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,218
You've got what, Boone?

181
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:00,636
Three days left?

182
00:11:01,011 --> 00:11:02,721
How's it feel?

183
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:09,437
l'm kind of terrified. Weird,
considering my former activities.

184
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:13,357
They say it can take
up to four minutes to die in the chair.

185
00:11:13,566 --> 00:11:17,903
Me, personally?
l'm hoping it takes a lot longer.

186
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:20,656
You really have changed.

187
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:23,200
The old Gibbs would never be
this abrupt.

188
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:25,161
Did you remarry?

189
00:11:27,037 --> 00:11:29,457
- You've got less than a minute.
- Okay. Okay. Too personal.

190
00:11:29,665 --> 00:11:34,378
And what about NClS Special Agent
Caitlin Todd? Can we talk about her?

191
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:39,425
<i>l saw her picture in The Post.
They said she was shot by a terrorist?</i>

192
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:44,638
Did you cut back on the caffeine
like l told you?

193
00:11:45,347 --> 00:11:47,057
See you Saturday.

194
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:50,436
Come on, Gibbs.
l was just having some fun with you.

195
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:51,937
You can't leave.

196
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:54,857
You're here because you're following
orders like a good Marine.

197
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:56,400
Right, Gunny?

198
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:59,612
l'll tell you where they are.
Where they all are.

199
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,782
There's more than 22, Jethro.

200
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,075
Lots more.

201
00:12:15,795 --> 00:12:18,047
- Where is he, Timothy?
- Who?

202
00:12:18,297 --> 00:12:20,299
Gibbs, damn it.

203
00:12:23,427 --> 00:12:24,804
Hey.

204
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,517
Do you know the difference between
good and bad cholesterol, Tony?

205
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:32,311
No, but l'm assuming
it has something to do with taste.

206
00:12:32,478 --> 00:12:35,481
Bad is what came back
on your last blood test.

207
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:37,441
- Dispose of this.
- Hey, hey, hey.

208
00:12:37,608 --> 00:12:41,529
- That cost me 1 6 bucks, that pizza.
- You'll thank me when you're my age.

209
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:43,531
But you eat pizza all the time.

210
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:45,866
- Exactly.
- l don't see the connection here.

211
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:48,911
Well, of course you wouldn't.
You're not a doctor.

212
00:12:50,121 --> 00:12:52,581
- Where is Gibbs?
- Sussex State Prison.

213
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,125
lnterviewing Kyle Boone.

214
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,709
He said he wasn't going.

215
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:59,004
- He wasn't.
- Until the SECNAV ordered him to.

216
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:01,340
- Who's with him?
- No one.

217
00:13:01,674 --> 00:13:04,009
Have you any idea the effect that
psychopath had

218
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:05,719
on Gibbs ten years ago?

219
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,557
Considering how open Gibbs is about
his personal life, no, not a clue.

220
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:12,268
He should not have gone alone.

221
00:13:12,977 --> 00:13:14,854
Ducky, it's Gibbs.
l'm sure he'll be fine.

222
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:19,233
lt's easy for you to say. You didn't have
to live through this the last time.

223
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,695
<i>- DiNozzo.
- Get the truck.</i>

224
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:25,114
<i>- Where?
- Boone Farm. Bring Cassidy.</i>

225
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:27,074
Yeah, l got it, boss.

226
00:13:27,283 --> 00:13:30,035
We're on our way. Cassidy, saddle up.
Gibbs wants you in the field.

227
00:13:30,202 --> 00:13:32,496
- Boone family farm.
- Wants me?

228
00:13:32,705 --> 00:13:34,540
That's what he said.
Let's roll.

229
00:13:34,707 --> 00:13:36,750
The difference between ten years ago
and today?

230
00:13:38,502 --> 00:13:41,046
- We have Gibbs back.
- There's another difference, Tony.

231
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:44,758
Ten years ago, Gibbs
was a very different man.

232
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:47,386
- You mean he was actually meaner?
- Oh, quite the opposite.

233
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:50,055
He was--

234
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:53,726
He was a lot like you.

235
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:05,070
What do we got?

236
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:10,910
l can save you the time, Gibbs.

237
00:14:11,076 --> 00:14:13,788
- My measurements are 34--
- Twenty-six, 34.

238
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,749
A hundred and twenty pounds?
l'm right, aren't l?

239
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,919
Did you weigh and measure me
in my sleep?

240
00:14:20,085 --> 00:14:23,172
l'm a crime scene sketch expert.
lt's what l do.

241
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:25,132
- You'll do.
- Gibbs, again.

242
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:27,468
You have such a way
of making a gal feel so special.

243
00:14:27,676 --> 00:14:29,053
Put this on.

244
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,262
- McGee?
- Yeah, boss?

245
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:32,681
You might wanna wear kneepads.

246
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:39,605
- Do we even have kneepads?
- Equipment inventory is Kate's job.

247
00:14:39,772 --> 00:14:41,273
You might wanna ask--

248
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:51,117
Do you know
what the hell we're doing?

249
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:53,953
- Following Gibbs' lead?
- On what?

250
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:55,538
- l don't know.
- You don't know

251
00:14:55,704 --> 00:14:59,708
- and that doesn't bother you at all?
- You get used to it.

252
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:01,585
Yeah, that's what l'm afraid of.

253
00:15:03,963 --> 00:15:08,467
This place must have been gone
over a dozen times, boss.

254
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:11,762
- No way there's any bodies in here.
- l'm not looking for bodies, Tony.

255
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:15,349
Boone was raised here by his uncle.
His mother was a prostitute.

256
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:17,143
She left town when he was 1 2.

257
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:19,812
Then what are we looking for?

258
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:21,564
Proof. Boone swears it's here.

259
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,984
The only place we didn't look is inside
this chimney.

260
00:15:25,651 --> 00:15:28,112
l think l got something.
No.

261
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,822
That's just another dead bird.

262
00:15:32,158 --> 00:15:33,325
Oh, that's disgusting.

263
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:37,371
l'll bet this wasn't in the brochure
when you signed up for NClS, probie.

264
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,582
- You know, you were wrong earlier.
- About what?

265
00:15:39,748 --> 00:15:41,542
She weighs more than a buck twenty.

266
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:45,004
Sorry.

267
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:47,506
- She did that on purpose.
- Okay. Oh, no. l got--

268
00:15:47,673 --> 00:15:49,633
lt's right here by the flue.
l got it.

269
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:51,677
- Okay. l got it. l'm coming down.
- Finally.

270
00:15:51,886 --> 00:15:54,889
You could have taken your boots--
Oh, jeez.

271
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:56,849
My bad.

272
00:15:57,683 --> 00:16:00,019
Looks like a book.

273
00:16:21,957 --> 00:16:24,752
Oh, there must be 30 pages there.

274
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,670
More.

275
00:16:27,963 --> 00:16:30,424
What's carved into their backs?

276
00:16:30,674 --> 00:16:32,760
That's his calling card, McGee.

277
00:16:38,474 --> 00:16:39,725
Something wrong?

278
00:16:39,892 --> 00:16:41,644
This section on my mother,
John, is better.

279
00:16:41,811 --> 00:16:45,898
- But it still needs work.
- l was trying to humanize her, Kyle.

280
00:16:46,315 --> 00:16:47,900
Don't.

281
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:51,320
You find it all right, Jethro?

282
00:16:52,113 --> 00:16:53,823
l guess you wouldn't be here
if you didn't.

283
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:56,826
l don't believe you've met
my biographer, John Briggs.

284
00:16:57,076 --> 00:16:59,245
Special Agent Gibbs, it is a pleasure.

285
00:16:59,411 --> 00:17:01,914
l've been trying to schedule
an interview with you for months.

286
00:17:02,081 --> 00:17:03,624
You're gonna have to leave now,
Briggs.

287
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:07,002
l've been granted special permission
by the State of Virginia to be here.

288
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:09,088
- Not anymore.
- Next time you see Boone,

289
00:17:09,255 --> 00:17:11,257
he'll have a thunderbolt shooting out
of his ass.

290
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:15,219
Hey, l was guaranteed full access
for the next three days.

291
00:17:15,428 --> 00:17:17,513
The warden asked you to leave.

292
00:17:17,763 --> 00:17:19,432
Don't make him ask you again.

293
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,517
You'll have to excuse Agent Gibbs,
John.

294
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:24,854
He's finally gotten a glimpse into
the world l've been telling him about.

295
00:17:25,104 --> 00:17:26,814
The scrapbook?

296
00:17:27,022 --> 00:17:29,483
You found his scrapbook?
When will it be released?

297
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:31,944
Son, if you wanna walk out of here
under your own power

298
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:34,447
l suggest you leave now.

299
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:45,040
John really is a wonderful writer.

300
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,002
You know, he spent years trying
to understand me.

301
00:17:48,252 --> 00:17:50,880
Unfortunately, he just never seemed
to measure up.

302
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,756
To who?

303
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:54,675
Your prostitute mom?

304
00:17:54,884 --> 00:17:59,305
Or your father? Some hick john
with a few extra bucks in his pocket?

305
00:17:59,472 --> 00:18:02,016
Actually, l was referring to you, Jethro.

306
00:18:02,808 --> 00:18:05,394
Show's over.
Where is the dumping ground?

307
00:18:05,644 --> 00:18:07,480
You show me my scrapbook
one last time

308
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:10,316
and l'll draw you a map
even a Marine can follow.

309
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:13,319
No. They've suffered enough.

310
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:15,196
Well, we're at an impasse.

311
00:18:15,404 --> 00:18:18,032
You gonna keep playing
this game with me, Boone?

312
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:23,078
l have never considered
any of this a game, Jethro.

313
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:26,165
- You know that.
- Whatever. l'm changing the rules.

314
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:28,209
- How so?
- l've seen your world.

315
00:18:29,794 --> 00:18:33,088
Now you're gonna spend what's left
of your miserable life in mine.

316
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:45,935
All right, listen up,
my probationary field agents.

317
00:18:46,185 --> 00:18:49,146
You are about to witness the transfer
of a maximum-security prisoner

318
00:18:49,313 --> 00:18:50,356
to our humble facility.

319
00:18:50,523 --> 00:18:53,192
While he's here,
he's our sole responsibility.

320
00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:57,571
- Oh, l'm sorry. Am l boring you?
- My God, does he ever stop?

321
00:18:57,822 --> 00:19:00,074
l'm just glad it's not me.

322
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:04,203
lt's 1 0:00. lt doesn't make sense
bringing Boone here now.

323
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,705
Gibbs is trying to put him
on unfamiliar ground.

324
00:19:06,914 --> 00:19:09,834
- Throw him off balance.
- Because that worked ten years ago?

325
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:13,045
- What's different now?
- l am, Cassidy.

326
00:19:13,212 --> 00:19:16,382
Stand tall.
Wake up, probies.

327
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,108
l knew l could
count on you, Jethro.

328
00:19:38,446 --> 00:19:40,489
lt's good to be home again.

329
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,246
Yep, good to be home.

330
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:54,587
The guy's been impersonating
a statue all night.

331
00:19:54,753 --> 00:19:57,089
According to the watch,
he hasn't moved a muscle.

332
00:19:57,882 --> 00:19:58,924
He's creepy.

333
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:02,261
When is Gibbs gonna start
his interrogation?

334
00:20:02,428 --> 00:20:04,930
- When he's ready.
- You might wanna tell him to hurry.

335
00:20:05,097 --> 00:20:09,143
He's got less than 48 hours before
Boone's scheduled to be executed.

336
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:12,313
l've got a better idea, Paula.

337
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:13,898
Why don't you tell him?

338
00:20:15,107 --> 00:20:17,109
Because l'm not stupid.

339
00:20:17,276 --> 00:20:18,611
No.

340
00:20:18,903 --> 00:20:20,988
Of all the things you are,

341
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,324
stupid definitely isn't one of them.

342
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:26,786
Thank you.

343
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:29,288
- Okay, what's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

344
00:20:30,122 --> 00:20:34,543
- By the way, how's Bobert?
- Why, are you jealous?

345
00:20:35,336 --> 00:20:37,129
Of a lawyer?
Give me a break.

346
00:20:37,296 --> 00:20:39,673
- He's very rich.
- Money isn't everything.

347
00:20:39,924 --> 00:20:41,926
He's got season tickets
to the Redskins.

348
00:20:42,134 --> 00:20:44,637
- Private skybox.
- l'm happy for him.

349
00:20:44,804 --> 00:20:46,222
And l almost forgot

350
00:20:47,056 --> 00:20:49,809
he drives a Ferrari.

351
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:53,479
Red.

352
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:56,148
Like Magnum.

353
00:20:57,483 --> 00:20:58,651
Well, that's nice.

354
00:20:59,235 --> 00:21:00,861
lsn't it?

355
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,489
You know what's even nicer?

356
00:21:03,948 --> 00:21:05,366
My current view.

357
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:08,160
Victoria's Secret?
Agent Cassidy.

358
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:11,163
Well, you enjoy it as long as you can,
Agent DiNozzo

359
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,666
because that's as close
as you're gonna get.

360
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:16,043
Cassidy?

361
00:21:18,254 --> 00:21:20,256
Check Boone's security detail.

362
00:21:20,506 --> 00:21:22,508
You got it.

363
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:25,177
- l'll give her a hand with that.
- Wait.

364
00:21:32,518 --> 00:21:34,353
- What was that for?
- Letting her get to you.

365
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,230
Boss, l was not letting her get--

366
00:21:37,606 --> 00:21:39,859
l won't let it happen again.

367
00:21:41,777 --> 00:21:44,864
- Thanks.
- lt's for Abby.

368
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:48,617
Go find out how many victims
she lD'd from Boone's scrapbook.

369
00:22:13,684 --> 00:22:16,270
There were 27 women
in the scrapbook, McGee.

370
00:22:16,437 --> 00:22:19,023
As far as l can tell, they're in the order
that they were killed.

371
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,609
Now, Boone has admitted
to killing 22

372
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:25,571
which matches with the photos
in the files that the FBl sent over.

373
00:22:25,738 --> 00:22:28,949
Which would make you think
that we'd be left with five Jane Does,

374
00:22:29,158 --> 00:22:34,079
but you'd be wrong because l know
who the first victim is.

375
00:22:34,914 --> 00:22:37,124
You're not listening
to a word l'm saying.

376
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,169
l'm pregnant, McGee.

377
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:41,921
Twins.

378
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:44,089
Haven't told the father yet.

379
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,468
lt's Gibbs. l know it's wrong

380
00:22:47,676 --> 00:22:50,554
but something about his silver hair
just gets me all tingly inside.

381
00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:52,598
Excuse me for a sec.
l think l'm gonna vomit.

382
00:22:52,932 --> 00:22:54,600
l'm joking, Tony.

383
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:56,685
Except for the part about Gibbs' hair.

384
00:22:56,894 --> 00:22:58,687
That is really hot.

385
00:22:58,854 --> 00:23:01,774
- McGee is ignoring me again.
- Easily fixable.

386
00:23:02,608 --> 00:23:05,194
- What? What'd l do?
- Stop ignoring Abby. She's sensitive.

387
00:23:05,402 --> 00:23:06,654
l'm sorry. l was concentrating.

388
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:08,906
l think that l know how we can find
Boone's victims

389
00:23:09,115 --> 00:23:10,616
without Gibbs having to talk to him.

390
00:23:10,866 --> 00:23:13,786
There are distinctive geographical
and man-made features

391
00:23:13,994 --> 00:23:15,204
in several of these pictures.

392
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:18,499
Here's a stream
and what may be a bridge.

393
00:23:18,707 --> 00:23:21,752
Up here appears to be a power line.

394
00:23:21,961 --> 00:23:23,921
Or some dirt on a picture.

395
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,341
lf l can make a land plot, create scale
by computing the distances

396
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:31,345
- between these points, then we can--
- Okay, streams and power lines?

397
00:23:31,554 --> 00:23:34,640
lt would take years searching just one
county, McGee. Never mind a state.

398
00:23:34,807 --> 00:23:37,017
Yeah, for us, Tony.
But not for a computer.

399
00:23:37,226 --> 00:23:39,478
Satellite imagery?
l should have thought of that.

400
00:23:39,645 --> 00:23:42,231
l need to figure a way
to calculate an accurate scale.

401
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,191
Polaroid cameras have
a fixed focal length.

402
00:23:44,358 --> 00:23:46,694
That's a good start. l'm gonna need
one known measurement.

403
00:23:46,861 --> 00:23:50,114
- Pick one body and l'll pull her stats.
- Three known vectors should do it.

404
00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:52,199
Okay. Okay.
Enough with the geek-speak.

405
00:23:52,408 --> 00:23:54,368
Gibbs wants to know how
many victims we lD'd.

406
00:23:54,577 --> 00:23:57,288
All except for the last four
in the scrapbook.

407
00:23:57,496 --> 00:23:59,832
We're running them
against missing persons reports

408
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:02,710
prior to Gibbs putting Boone
behind bars. No matches yet.

409
00:24:02,918 --> 00:24:06,338
The one that stands out the most
is the first victim.

410
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:09,091
She disappeared in 1 97 4.

411
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,260
Are you sure about that, Abs?

412
00:24:11,469 --> 00:24:13,220
Boone was just a kid back then.

413
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:17,099
l know. And it turns out his mother
did not abandon him.

414
00:24:17,308 --> 00:24:20,311
She was his first kill.

415
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:32,031
You don't have to do this again,
you know.

416
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:34,909
You're wrong, Duck. l do.

417
00:24:36,076 --> 00:24:38,704
He's never gonna tell you
where those poor girls are.

418
00:24:38,871 --> 00:24:41,874
- l know that.
- Then why?

419
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:45,961
Because ten years ago
l couldn't break him.

420
00:24:46,212 --> 00:24:48,255
No, but you did
what no one else could.

421
00:24:48,464 --> 00:24:51,467
- You caught the son of a bitch.
- l should have killed him.

422
00:24:51,717 --> 00:24:54,929
And in two days that will be rectified.

423
00:24:55,846 --> 00:24:58,349
l'm telling you as a friend.

424
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:00,935
lt's time to let this one go.

425
00:25:01,143 --> 00:25:02,394
Not yet, Ducky.

426
00:25:02,603 --> 00:25:05,439
You already lost one relationship
as a result of this case.

427
00:25:05,606 --> 00:25:06,982
She was a wonderful girl.

428
00:25:07,233 --> 00:25:11,070
- And you neglected--
- She left me, Duck. l didn't leave her.

429
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:15,116
No.
You made it impossible for her to stay.

430
00:25:19,745 --> 00:25:22,665
Okay, send him up.
Make sure he's escorted.

431
00:25:22,873 --> 00:25:24,458
l'll let Gibbs know.

432
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,920
Comfortable?

433
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:31,257
- Yeah, as a matter of fact--
- lt was a rhetorical question, lady.

434
00:25:31,465 --> 00:25:34,635
Wow, l never realized how sensitive
you were about your desk.

435
00:25:34,844 --> 00:25:36,846
There's a lot about me
you don't realise, Cassidy.

436
00:25:37,012 --> 00:25:39,056
- Where's Gibbs?
- lnterrogation.

437
00:25:39,265 --> 00:25:41,392
Boone's lawyer is here.
He claims he wasn't notified

438
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,270
about his client's being moved
and he wants to talk to him.

439
00:25:44,437 --> 00:25:46,689
Gibbs doesn't like to be kept waiting.

440
00:25:46,856 --> 00:25:48,524
You better go right in there

441
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:52,111
and tell him yourself. l'll get the suit.

442
00:25:56,282 --> 00:25:58,033
Finally.

443
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:00,995
So where should we start this time,
Jethro?

444
00:26:01,203 --> 00:26:02,455
My childhood?

445
00:26:02,663 --> 00:26:05,082
l didn't bring you in here to talk, Boone.

446
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:08,043
So you decided to let me see
my photographs again?

447
00:26:08,294 --> 00:26:10,588
l told you that's not gonna happen.

448
00:26:10,796 --> 00:26:13,716
lnteresting.
May l ask why l'm here then?

449
00:26:13,924 --> 00:26:17,303
The state is hoping
that l'll get the location of your victims.

450
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:19,847
l believe that requires some form
of communication.

451
00:26:20,014 --> 00:26:23,058
l said the state. Me?

452
00:26:23,642 --> 00:26:24,852
l'm not even gonna try.

453
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,397
But you always try, Jethro.
That's why l like you.

454
00:26:28,606 --> 00:26:31,150
l've taken you out of the system,
Boone.

455
00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:35,362
You're gonna sit here, alone, without
any human contact until you fry.

456
00:26:35,571 --> 00:26:37,072
The game ends now.

457
00:26:39,325 --> 00:26:43,954
This room brings back
so many memories, doesn't it?

458
00:26:45,915 --> 00:26:48,000
Special Agent Gibbs, a word please?

459
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:50,336
Sounds like you replaced
your dead female.

460
00:26:51,045 --> 00:26:53,130
Any chance l can meet this one?

461
00:26:59,345 --> 00:27:01,764
Well, l'll be here if you need me.

462
00:27:05,184 --> 00:27:07,144
- What?
- Boone's attorney is here.

463
00:27:07,353 --> 00:27:10,439
The DA's afraid if we deny him access,
he'll find a sympathetic judge

464
00:27:10,606 --> 00:27:13,025
- and have the execution delayed.
- l got it.

465
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:17,154
Look, l need a privileged conversation
with my client.

466
00:27:17,363 --> 00:27:19,949
Meaning, Agent Gibbs,
l want your observation room cleared

467
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:22,868
and all microphones turned off.

468
00:27:23,035 --> 00:27:26,372
- That's it, counsellor?
- For now, agent.

469
00:27:26,872 --> 00:27:28,040
Tony?

470
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:33,879
- Yeah, hold on a second.
- Search him first thoroughly.

471
00:27:42,304 --> 00:27:43,722
l'm impressed.

472
00:27:44,181 --> 00:27:46,642
- lt's actually working.
- Thank you.

473
00:27:47,184 --> 00:27:49,770
Now all we have to do is scan
through 800,000 miles

474
00:27:49,979 --> 00:27:52,106
of satellite imagery,
and pray we get lucky.

475
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:55,151
l am a scientist, McGee.

476
00:27:55,401 --> 00:27:57,945
Luck has nothing to do with it
and/or us.

477
00:27:58,988 --> 00:28:02,241
Okay, then how do you explain
something like Gibbs' gut?

478
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,494
Well, that's easy. Gibbs is lucky.

479
00:28:05,703 --> 00:28:09,457
- But you just said that--
- He's not a scientist.

480
00:28:12,293 --> 00:28:13,544
Agent Gibbs,

481
00:28:13,752 --> 00:28:15,754
if anything happens to my client while
he's here,

482
00:28:15,921 --> 00:28:18,466
l want you to know l am gonna hold
you personally responsible--

483
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:21,969
You have my word he will be
in perfect health for his execution.

484
00:28:23,012 --> 00:28:26,849
Escort Mr. O'Neill out of my building,
Special Agent Cassidy.

485
00:28:27,057 --> 00:28:28,768
You'll be hearing from me.

486
00:28:29,018 --> 00:28:30,603
Let's go.

487
00:28:31,228 --> 00:28:33,147
You going back in there, boss?

488
00:28:33,773 --> 00:28:35,858
Yeah, maybe. Gibbs.

489
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:37,276
<i>Gibbs, it's Abby.</i>

490
00:28:37,443 --> 00:28:39,111
<i>We think we found Boone's
dumping ground.</i>

491
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:42,114
<i>We've got it on a screen in my lab.</i>

492
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:44,742
They think they may have found
his dumping ground.

493
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:51,040
- What am l looking at?
- Take it away, McGee.

494
00:28:55,127 --> 00:28:58,464
l mean, very Special Agent McGee.

495
00:28:58,672 --> 00:29:02,968
Probable site where the victims
were tortured, killed, perhaps buried.

496
00:29:03,969 --> 00:29:05,387
- You wanna know how?
- Not really.

497
00:29:05,596 --> 00:29:07,473
Good, because it was mostly luck.

498
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:10,101
Where? Wilderness area
at Great Falls National Park.

499
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:12,520
- Tony, you lead the team.
- Where are you going, boss?

500
00:29:12,686 --> 00:29:14,688
After ten years, l finally got something
on Boone

501
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:16,482
he doesn't already know about.

502
00:29:17,358 --> 00:29:19,276
My lawyer was very upset.

503
00:29:19,485 --> 00:29:22,655
He wanted to move me back to prison.
But don't worry.

504
00:29:22,863 --> 00:29:25,825
- l told him l like it here.
- Don't get too comfortable.

505
00:29:26,075 --> 00:29:27,618
You're going back today.

506
00:29:27,827 --> 00:29:29,829
Really? What's changed?

507
00:29:30,663 --> 00:29:32,998
You found something, didn't you?

508
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:47,805
The site where the photos were taken
is 265 feet

509
00:29:48,013 --> 00:29:51,267
on a track of 31 0 degrees.
We need to get through here.

510
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:54,603
Okay.

511
00:29:54,895 --> 00:29:57,648
Remember what l told you
about the poison ivy, all right?

512
00:29:57,857 --> 00:30:00,067
- Don't tell Cassidy.
- What?

513
00:30:00,276 --> 00:30:01,902
Nothing.

514
00:30:02,194 --> 00:30:03,821
Follow me.

515
00:30:09,076 --> 00:30:11,412
l'm okay. l'm okay.

516
00:30:12,163 --> 00:30:15,583
This is steep.
Watch yourselves.

517
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:26,802
Well, if this is the place
l can see why Boone picked it.

518
00:30:27,052 --> 00:30:30,848
Off the beaten path,
no hard surfaces to reflect sound.

519
00:30:31,056 --> 00:30:33,976
Those girls could scream
their heads off and no one would hear.

520
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:36,854
Yeah, this is the perfect spot.

521
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:18,104
Guys,

522
00:31:18,395 --> 00:31:19,730
we're in the right place.

523
00:31:25,903 --> 00:31:28,864
No reception.
Spread out, tape it off.

524
00:31:29,115 --> 00:31:31,492
We'll hike back and call Gibbs.

525
00:31:34,203 --> 00:31:36,831
Come on, Jethro.

526
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:40,501
We both know you're in there.

527
00:31:44,713 --> 00:31:47,133
- Hey.
- Hey.

528
00:31:47,716 --> 00:31:49,468
- What are you doing here?
- l wanted to see

529
00:31:49,635 --> 00:31:50,970
what the monster looks like.

530
00:31:56,976 --> 00:31:59,061
He doesn't look that scary.

531
00:32:00,938 --> 00:32:02,982
You saw the photographs?

532
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,025
Yeah.

533
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:16,162
You did good, McGee.
l'm proud of you.

534
00:32:16,328 --> 00:32:17,997
And?

535
00:32:18,497 --> 00:32:19,540
And what?

536
00:32:19,707 --> 00:32:22,334
Well, usually, you add
some kind of insult at the end.

537
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:23,919
No, l don't.

538
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,714
Well, okay, maybe sometimes.

539
00:32:26,922 --> 00:32:30,676
- But the point is, we're a team.
- Tony?

540
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:37,391
You all right?

541
00:32:37,683 --> 00:32:40,019
l was a little startled.

542
00:32:40,227 --> 00:32:41,479
By what?

543
00:32:41,687 --> 00:32:43,731
Her.

544
00:32:54,116 --> 00:32:57,328
She couldn't have been dead
more than a few days.

545
00:32:58,746 --> 00:33:01,540
Tony, you're not gonna believe it.

546
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,376
Boone's mark.

547
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:18,725
l-- l can't get any reception out here.

548
00:33:19,726 --> 00:33:21,436
That's not surprising.

549
00:33:21,644 --> 00:33:23,813
Butt-nowhere isn't part
of our coverage plan.

550
00:33:24,022 --> 00:33:26,899
l'm gonna head back to the truck
and try and get the call through.

551
00:33:27,108 --> 00:33:29,986
Okay, tell Gibbs we're gonna need
everything and everyone on this one.

552
00:33:30,236 --> 00:33:31,487
l'll be back in 20 minutes.

553
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,462
Yeah, Gibbs.

554
00:33:47,712 --> 00:33:48,963
Gibbs.

555
00:33:49,213 --> 00:33:51,132
<i>- We found Boone's dumping ground.
- Good work.</i>

556
00:33:51,466 --> 00:33:54,260
<i>- Tell Tony he needs to call--
- We also found a fresh body.</i>

557
00:33:54,427 --> 00:33:56,262
Female.
Dead less than a week.

558
00:33:56,429 --> 00:33:58,598
She has Boone's mark on her back.

559
00:33:58,806 --> 00:34:01,809
l think we're definitely dealing
with a copycat killer.

560
00:34:02,936 --> 00:34:06,606
- Gibbs? Gibbs, can you hear me?
- Yeah, l heard you.

561
00:34:06,773 --> 00:34:08,942
l want the area sealed off.
l'm on my way.

562
00:34:17,283 --> 00:34:18,785
Tony.

563
00:34:19,786 --> 00:34:22,163
- Something's not right.
- No, nothing has been

564
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,582
since Boone showed up at NClS.

565
00:34:24,749 --> 00:34:26,960
No. No, l know this girl.

566
00:34:28,002 --> 00:34:30,129
You know her?
How?

567
00:34:30,296 --> 00:34:33,049
You know her too. She was
the last entry in Boone's scrapbook.

568
00:34:33,258 --> 00:34:34,634
One of the Jane Does.

569
00:34:35,802 --> 00:34:38,680
He's been on death row for ten years,
McGee.

570
00:34:38,888 --> 00:34:42,850
She's been here less than a week.
That's not possible.

571
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:51,526
lt can't be.

572
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:01,244
You look a little peaked, Jethro.

573
00:35:01,452 --> 00:35:03,413
ls something wrong?

574
00:35:03,746 --> 00:35:05,373
Maybe l can help.

575
00:35:05,581 --> 00:35:08,918
A new development, perhaps?

576
00:35:09,335 --> 00:35:10,628
l gotta hand it to you, Boone.

577
00:35:11,546 --> 00:35:13,172
l did my best.

578
00:35:13,381 --> 00:35:15,925
But you got me to play your game.
Congratulations.

579
00:35:16,968 --> 00:35:19,470
You found the bodies. Good.

580
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:22,432
Not what you were expecting,
was it?

581
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,559
You see, there's someone else
out there, now.

582
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:26,185
A new threat.

583
00:35:26,394 --> 00:35:29,147
And l'm the only one
who can help you find him.

584
00:35:30,148 --> 00:35:32,233
You'll have to request a stay
of my execution.

585
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:36,195
l'm gonna have to pass on that.

586
00:35:37,405 --> 00:35:41,075
No matter how this plays out,
you're gonna sit in that chair Saturday.

587
00:35:41,284 --> 00:35:43,953
You can't have changed this much.
You have a sworn duty.

588
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,997
Maybe. Ten years ago.

589
00:35:46,205 --> 00:35:48,333
Now, hell.

590
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:50,668
l can wait till Sunday
to start an investigation.

591
00:35:50,877 --> 00:35:53,963
- You're bluffing.
- You're dead in 36 hours.

592
00:35:54,172 --> 00:35:57,050
Yeah, well, l'll be here
when you change your mind.

593
00:36:13,608 --> 00:36:15,526
Cassidy.

594
00:36:17,654 --> 00:36:18,947
Cassidy.

595
00:36:19,989 --> 00:36:21,491
Great. She's lost.

596
00:36:21,699 --> 00:36:24,744
Why didn't you give her
your GPS thingy, probie?

597
00:36:25,662 --> 00:36:26,996
She's not lost.

598
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:29,874
What's going on?

599
00:36:31,918 --> 00:36:33,169
She's been kidnapped.

600
00:36:34,504 --> 00:36:36,089
McGee, where is my list
of every visitor

601
00:36:36,256 --> 00:36:38,424
and phone call Boone's
had since he's been in prison?

602
00:36:38,591 --> 00:36:40,677
- l'm working it, boss.
- Tony?

603
00:36:42,553 --> 00:36:45,098
- Tony. Backup team's in place?
- Yeah.

604
00:36:45,932 --> 00:36:47,934
l never should have let her
take off alone, boss.

605
00:36:48,726 --> 00:36:52,730
The Polaroid of Cassidy is clean.
No prints, no DNA. l'm sorry, Gibbs.

606
00:36:52,897 --> 00:36:54,774
- l screwed this thing up.
- You screwed it up?

607
00:36:54,941 --> 00:36:57,026
We should have known
there was more than one killer.

608
00:36:57,193 --> 00:36:59,696
l only ran the Jane Does
up until the time Boone was captured.

609
00:36:59,904 --> 00:37:01,948
All four have gone missing
the last three years.

610
00:37:02,156 --> 00:37:04,492
Concentrate on Boone's contacts
over the past three years.

611
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:05,910
Yeah.

612
00:37:06,953 --> 00:37:08,121
We can't lose another agent.

613
00:37:08,538 --> 00:37:09,956
- l can't take this.
- Okay.

614
00:37:10,123 --> 00:37:12,166
Our best bet is a guy named
John Frederick Briggs.

615
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:15,253
ln the last three years,
he's logged 229 phone calls

616
00:37:15,461 --> 00:37:16,963
and visited Boone
96 times.

617
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,423
He's writing Boone's biography.

618
00:37:18,631 --> 00:37:20,717
- He's living it.
- He's off to a good start.

619
00:37:20,883 --> 00:37:22,927
Dishonourable discharge
from the Army in '91 .

620
00:37:23,136 --> 00:37:25,346
Arrested for domestic disturbance
in 2000

621
00:37:25,513 --> 00:37:27,223
- for beating his girlfriend.
- Find him.

622
00:37:27,432 --> 00:37:28,975
Home address
and cell phone number.

623
00:37:29,142 --> 00:37:32,061
- Find out if his cell has a GPS locator.
- Checked the carrier.

624
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,939
lt does and it can be remotely activated
if it's reported stolen.

625
00:37:35,106 --> 00:37:36,774
- Good job, McGee.
- Good job, McGee.

626
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:38,151
Let's roll.

627
00:37:49,078 --> 00:37:52,457
Okay, Briggs' cell provider
is relaying us his location.

628
00:37:52,665 --> 00:37:55,585
- He's in movement.
- He's headed out of D.C. on 1 90 west.

629
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,718
He's getting off the 1 90 at Oakley.

630
00:38:03,927 --> 00:38:06,471
lf you get off at MacArthur,
you might make it before him.

631
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:13,811
<i>- How far ahead is he?
- Less than a mile.</i>

632
00:38:20,151 --> 00:38:21,861
That's gotta be him.

633
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,290
Keep your hands on the wheel.
Keep them up.

634
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:36,542
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

635
00:38:36,751 --> 00:38:38,086
Where is she, Briggs?

636
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,839
Okay.
Okay, l have every right to be here.

637
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,509
Heard from a guard
you found the bodies.

638
00:38:46,386 --> 00:38:48,429
- l wanna see them.
- Shut up.

639
00:38:56,646 --> 00:38:58,815
Hello.

640
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:11,494
What did you do to me?

641
00:39:13,621 --> 00:39:16,749
l hit you in the head with a shovel,
my dear.

642
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:19,836
- Did you kill that woman we found?
- l did.

643
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:24,132
How many more are there, O'Neill?

644
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,717
Let's see, there was...

645
00:39:25,883 --> 00:39:28,720
There was one, and then
there's two, three, four.

646
00:39:29,345 --> 00:39:31,014
You will make five.

647
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:37,395
How did Boone turn his lawyer
into his replacement?

648
00:39:37,562 --> 00:39:41,649
You really think l'm Boone's lawyer
by coincidence? Come on.

649
00:39:41,858 --> 00:39:44,819
See, l--
l sought Boone out.

650
00:39:47,155 --> 00:39:48,448
Why?

651
00:39:48,656 --> 00:39:50,491
So l could learn from him.

652
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,744
Learn from the best.

653
00:39:52,952 --> 00:39:56,748
And you,
you're my graduation present.

654
00:40:03,755 --> 00:40:07,717
You know, you can scream
if you want to. lt's allowed.

655
00:40:13,556 --> 00:40:15,725
Kyle says he wants Agent Gibbs
to remember him

656
00:40:15,892 --> 00:40:19,020
for a long, long time
after he's gone.

657
00:40:19,228 --> 00:40:20,813
So you and me

658
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,485
we're gonna take this nice and slow.

659
00:40:34,744 --> 00:40:35,912
Fighter, huh?

660
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:38,665
l haven't had one of those before.

661
00:40:38,831 --> 00:40:40,625
Try that thing again with that knife--

662
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:43,419
You wanted to see your scrapbook?

663
00:40:44,128 --> 00:40:46,464
Where is my agent?

664
00:40:55,098 --> 00:40:56,849
Stop.

665
00:40:57,308 --> 00:40:58,476
Stop--

666
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,021
Look, you don't know what--

667
00:41:02,272 --> 00:41:03,731
You don't know what you're doing.

668
00:41:05,566 --> 00:41:08,278
- Jethro. Don't.
- Damn it.

669
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,282
l don't know where she is.
How can l?

670
00:41:14,033 --> 00:41:17,954
Gibbs, please. Just let me see
them one last time. Please.

671
00:41:18,162 --> 00:41:19,706
l'm begging you.

672
00:41:20,456 --> 00:41:23,668
Where is she?

673
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,427
We all know
you can't destroy evidence.

674
00:41:32,635 --> 00:41:34,554
Pathetic, Jethro.

675
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,308
Do you really think that l need that
to see them?

676
00:41:38,891 --> 00:41:41,811
When they're all up here,
anytime l want?

677
00:41:42,895 --> 00:41:44,439
Your agent is gonna suffer.

678
00:41:44,647 --> 00:41:47,483
The obscenities unleashed on her,
legendary. You know why?

679
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:51,195
Because you're the one
that stopped me. This is all your fault.

680
00:41:54,949 --> 00:41:58,995
He's cutting her tongue
out of her mouth right now.

681
00:41:59,621 --> 00:42:01,164
And you know the best part?

682
00:42:01,331 --> 00:42:03,207
After l'm gone

683
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:06,336
bodies are just gonna continue
to pile up.

684
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,672
Shoot me.

685
00:42:12,008 --> 00:42:14,552
You're supposed to shoot me,
you idiot!

686
00:42:14,761 --> 00:42:18,806
That the big plan you spent
ten years working on?

687
00:42:20,308 --> 00:42:25,021
Get me to murder you
and ruin my own life?

688
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,776
He's carving your name
in her back right now.

689
00:42:29,984 --> 00:42:33,029
Game's over.
Back to death row.

690
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,365
Gibbs.

691
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:41,162
The governor call yet? Because they're
not gonna kill me now.

692
00:42:41,371 --> 00:42:43,623
l'm the only one
who can identify the killer.

693
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:48,419
Do you think she screamed
when he cut out her tongue, Jethro?

694
00:42:48,586 --> 00:42:49,671
l don't know.

695
00:42:49,879 --> 00:42:52,340
Why don't you ask her yourself?

696
00:42:54,634 --> 00:42:57,262
l'm afraid your lawyer is gonna miss
your execution tomorrow.

697
00:42:57,428 --> 00:42:59,597
He's kind of dead.

698
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,100
Enjoy hell.

699
00:43:03,726 --> 00:43:07,855
No. No! No!
