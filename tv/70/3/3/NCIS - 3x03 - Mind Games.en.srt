1
00:00:07,087 --> 00:00:09,157
-Step down.
-Go.

2
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:16,718
Go ahead and open it up.

3
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:23,598
Up there.

4
00:00:35,727 --> 00:00:38,400
Tell me this has not been
just a total waste of my time, trooper.

5
00:00:38,727 --> 00:00:42,037
There's something up here, sir.
l'm just not exactly sure what it is.

6
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:45,761
You promised us bodies.

7
00:00:46,407 --> 00:00:48,159
One thing at a time, warden.

8
00:00:48,327 --> 00:00:51,046
First we start with my souvenirs.

9
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:52,999
- Souvenirs?
- When l was sick.

10
00:00:55,447 --> 00:00:57,244
- Are you all right?
- l'm all right.

11
00:00:57,447 --> 00:01:01,122
They were my favourite sexual organs.
Tongues.

12
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,961
Where are the girls?

13
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:05,996
Close.

14
00:01:06,207 --> 00:01:08,516
But you have to give me
something in return for them.

15
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:10,643
The only thing you're gonna get
is your last meal.

16
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:14,157
- Take that animal back to death row.
- What about the victims' families?

17
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:15,800
l'm their last chance for closure.

18
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:17,679
- What is it you want?
- Not much.

19
00:01:18,527 --> 00:01:19,960
Just the man who put me in these.

20
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:25,321
NClS Special Agent
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

21
00:02:06,687 --> 00:02:08,757
l will never forget the day
Gibbs caught this psycho.

22
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:12,118
You knew Gibbs back then?

23
00:02:12,527 --> 00:02:15,883
No. l was a junior at Georgetown
and for two years,

24
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:18,237
every woman in D.C.
was afraid to go out at night.

25
00:02:18,447 --> 00:02:21,200
- That must have been tough.
- Yeah. You have no idea.

26
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:24,843
l actually owe Gibbs for the first
full night of sleep l got in college.

27
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:27,083
l meant dating.

28
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:30,961
Yes. Yes. Dating was tough.

29
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:33,920
- Need any help with that now, Paula?
- No, Tony. Thank you.

30
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:37,676
l've been there and l've done that.

31
00:02:37,887 --> 00:02:40,447
Your problem with women
is where you're focused.

32
00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:42,763
Where?

33
00:02:46,247 --> 00:02:48,477
Here. lt's a mirror.

34
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:51,280
Quick question.

35
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:53,876
The pink ones, do they taste
like Strawberry Starburst?

36
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:57,762
- l thought you weren't seeing anyone.
- l'm not.

37
00:02:58,207 --> 00:03:01,802
- lt's for my complexion.
- Complexion got a name?

38
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:04,157
Tony, you so don't wanna go there.

39
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:06,676
Tell me it's not another agent
because l don't think l--

40
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:13,684
His name's Bob and he's a lawyer.

41
00:03:13,887 --> 00:03:15,957
What a coincidence.
l hate lawyers.

42
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:20,206
l know. So do l. That's why
it's purely a sexual relationship.

43
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:22,204
Well, what would that make me?

44
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:25,956
A big mistake. lf you do not give me
by birth control pills,

45
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:27,759
l'm going to break your arm.

46
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:31,205
Got that coffee.

47
00:03:31,407 --> 00:03:34,524
- Have you been there long?
- Long enough to say: ''No, ma'am.''

48
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:37,161
- Agent Cassidy.
- Okay. Good answer.

49
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:40,364
Thank you.

50
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:43,921
l let her do that.

51
00:03:44,127 --> 00:03:45,446
Thank you.

52
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:47,800
Who's that?

53
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:52,005
- Kyle Boone.
- He's an infamous serial killer, probie.

54
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:53,959
Terrorized the District in the '90s.
Come on.

55
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,761
Twenty-two women went missing
and five bodies were found.

56
00:03:56,967 --> 00:03:58,923
Guy only made one mistake.

57
00:03:59,127 --> 00:04:01,118
He killed a petty officer.

58
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:02,885
- Gibbs caught him?
- He's scheduled

59
00:04:03,047 --> 00:04:05,322
for a government-sanctioned
dirt-nap on Saturday.

60
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:08,325
He wants to talk to Gibbs
before they flip the switch.

61
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:09,960
- Why?
- Claims he's gonna tell him

62
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:14,086
- where the bodies are.
- What is that doing on my screen?

63
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,802
- l didn't put it there, boss.
- Who did, McGee?

64
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,362
Probie, let me handle this.

65
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:22,205
Boss.

66
00:04:23,207 --> 00:04:24,879
She did it.

67
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:29,245
We heard you were interviewing

68
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:34,205
Kyle Boone and we assumed
we would be providing backup.

69
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,001
You heard wrong, Cassidy.
l'm not interviewing anyone.

70
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:39,437
Then you might wanna let
the governor of Virginia know.

71
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:42,565
Since MTAC has him standing by
waiting for your call.

72
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:48,682
Find her a desk.

73
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:50,878
- ls that one?
- No, it's taken.

74
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:56,717
A whole week of TAD with Gibbs.
l can smell the fun already.

75
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:58,360
Well, it's been a tough month.

76
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:00,717
Right now he pretty much
hates everyone, Paula.

77
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:03,478
lncluding himself.

78
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:06,599
<i>l was told by your director that you</i>
<i>would personally be interviewing</i>

79
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:08,803
<i>Kyle Boone this afternoon,</i>
<i>Agent Gibbs.</i>

80
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:11,316
Director Shepard was misinformed,
governor.

81
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:13,722
Talking to Kyle Boone
would be a waste of time.

82
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:16,725
<i>Possibly. But if there's even a chance</i>
<i>that he would reveal to you</i>

83
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:18,878
<i>the location of his victims,</i>
<i>we have to take it.</i>

84
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:20,275
l disagree, sir.

85
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,365
He's had ten years to think about it.
Why the change of heart now?

86
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:28,197
<i>ln my experience, men facing</i>
<i>imminent death tend to re-evaluate</i>

87
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:30,398
<i>the course of their lives.</i>

88
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:32,326
<i>Most seek forgiveness.</i>

89
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:34,882
You trust me, sir.
Boone had a lot of interests.

90
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:39,075
Forgiveness wasn't one of them.

91
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:42,360
- <i>How can you be so sure?</i>
- l spent five months interrogating him.

92
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:44,523
<i>A decade ago. People change.</i>

93
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:47,560
People, sir. Maybe.

94
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:49,766
Not Kyle Boone.

95
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:53,961
- <i>Are you refusing to meet with him?</i>
- l'm refusing to entertain

96
00:05:54,127 --> 00:05:58,166
a homicidal maniac who tortured
and killed 22 women, sir.

97
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:01,040
l have played that game before.

98
00:06:01,247 --> 00:06:04,956
<i>The hundreds of family members who</i>
<i>lost a daughter, a sister or a mother?</i>

99
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:07,727
- <i>What do l tell them?</i>
- That no matter what Kyle Boone says

100
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:13,280
in the next few days, come Saturday,
sir, you're gonna make sure he fries.

101
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:17,244
<i>We all owe you a debt of gratitude</i>
<i>for bringing him to justice, Gibbs.</i>

102
00:06:17,447 --> 00:06:20,723
<i>But you leave me little choice.</i>

103
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:23,996
<i>l am sorry.</i>

104
00:06:28,727 --> 00:06:32,197
We've got a high-priority transmission
coming through for you in MTAC.

105
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:35,558
- From who?
- The secretary of the Navy.

106
00:06:46,847 --> 00:06:49,236
- Well, look on the bright side.
- What is the bright side?

107
00:06:50,607 --> 00:06:52,279
You're only here a week.

108
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:57,118
- Why couldn't l sit at Kate's desk?
- Mostly because it's still Kate's desk.

109
00:06:57,327 --> 00:06:59,318
She was a great agent.

110
00:06:59,527 --> 00:07:01,199
Yeah.

111
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,038
- How are you handling it?
- Same way l handle everything.

112
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:07,203
l try not to think about it.

113
00:07:07,487 --> 00:07:11,002
- And when that doesn't work?
- There's always junk food.

114
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:12,879
lt doesn't sound very healthy, Tony.

115
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:15,681
lt's either that or l start building a boat
in my basement.

116
00:07:15,887 --> 00:07:19,880
- Did you move from your apartment?
- No. Now you see my dilemma.

117
00:07:20,087 --> 00:07:23,796
Hey, if you ever do wanna talk about it,
l'm here for you.

118
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:25,840
Okay?

119
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:29,839
- You mean that?
- Yes, of course l mean that.

120
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:36,080
Okay.
Well, then let me ask you something.

121
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:38,846
What's Bobby like in bed?

122
00:07:41,047 --> 00:07:45,677
Kate was right.
You are truly, truly pathetic, DiNozzo.

123
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:47,715
You two might wanna get busy.

124
00:07:47,887 --> 00:07:50,481
Gibbs is headed this way
and he looks pissed.

125
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:52,359
- Think he caved to the governor?
- No way.

126
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:54,802
No way. lf Gibbs doesn't wanna do
something he doesn't.

127
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:56,923
No matter who's asking.

128
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:03,238
- Where you going, boss?
- Sussex State Prison

129
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:04,681
to interview Kyle Boone.

130
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:06,798
Be gone the rest of the day.

131
00:08:07,007 --> 00:08:09,475
Yep, you two sure have him pegged.

132
00:08:10,087 --> 00:08:12,396
We moved Boone to death watch
on Monday.

133
00:08:12,607 --> 00:08:14,245
That's when he decided
he wanted to talk.

134
00:08:14,447 --> 00:08:16,483
We do things a little different here
in Virginia.

135
00:08:16,687 --> 00:08:18,120
The condemned get a choice:

136
00:08:18,807 --> 00:08:20,559
Lethal injection
or death by electrocution.

137
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:22,718
Boone is the first one
to choose the chair.

138
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:25,157
- He deserves the worse.
- Special Agent Gibbs?

139
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:27,039
l'm Adam O'Neill,
Kyle Boone's attorney.

140
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,526
l really appreciate your coming.

141
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:33,438
l understand your reluctance here.

142
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:36,919
But l truly believe
that my client's intentions are sincere.

143
00:08:37,127 --> 00:08:38,321
The day l arrested your client,

144
00:08:38,487 --> 00:08:41,399
we found two human female tongues
in his refrigerator.

145
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:44,679
- l'm familiar with the case.
- Are you familiar with his victims?

146
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:46,439
Look, l'm not here
to talk about the past.

147
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:49,036
- l'm here trying to save a man's life.
- Boone wants a deal?

148
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:52,324
No. Mr. Boone wants the chair
for his crimes.

149
00:08:52,527 --> 00:08:55,564
l'm the one hoping
to get him life in prison.

150
00:08:57,527 --> 00:08:58,846
Good luck with that.

151
00:08:59,407 --> 00:09:00,760
Agent Gibbs, please!

152
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:03,725
l'm just trying to do my job here.

153
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:09,001
Maybe together we can both help
the victims' families find some closure.

154
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:10,886
Be there Saturday.

155
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:13,999
- You'll be able to see them get that.
- Right this way, gentlemen.

156
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:16,118
Well, actually, against my advice

157
00:09:17,047 --> 00:09:20,437
Mr. Boone has elected to meet
with Agent Gibbs, alone.

158
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:22,603
There will be a guard out here
if you need him.

159
00:09:23,887 --> 00:09:25,479
l won't.

160
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:34,565
Nice to see you again, Jethro.

161
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,598
l wasn't sure if you'd come,
but here you are.

162
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,163
You've got two minutes.
Start talking.

163
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:45,605
You know,

164
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:47,684
you look almost the same.

165
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:51,797
Except the hair.
When did it go grey?

166
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:53,156
Where are the bodies?

167
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:55,403
We'll get to that.

168
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,837
There's just a few things l need
to ask you first.

169
00:09:58,047 --> 00:10:00,766
l guess they showed you
my souvenirs?

170
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:04,516
- There weren't 20 in that jar.
- Your point?

171
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:07,082
l always thought you were padding
your count.

172
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:10,407
Baiting me?
Denigrating my rep?

173
00:10:10,607 --> 00:10:13,246
Come on. You know that approach
never worked on me, Jethro.

174
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:17,076
- A minute thirty-eight.
- Can't we just chat for a bit?

175
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:18,879
Catch up?

176
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:22,837
How's the wife?

177
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:27,405
She left you, didn't she?

178
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:29,478
l tried to warn you about that.

179
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:31,279
Women can't understand men
like us.

180
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:32,602
You've got what, Boone?

181
00:10:32,807 --> 00:10:33,956
Three days left?

182
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:35,965
How's it feel?

183
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:42,402
l'm kind of terrified. Weird,
considering my former activities.

184
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:46,161
They say it can take
up to four minutes to die in the chair.

185
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:50,519
Me, personally?
l'm hoping it takes a lot longer.

186
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:53,165
You really have changed.

187
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:55,602
The old Gibbs would never be
this abrupt.

188
00:10:56,047 --> 00:10:57,480
Did you remarry?

189
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:01,596
- You've got less than a minute.
- Okay. Okay. Too personal.

190
00:11:01,807 --> 00:11:06,323
And what about NClS Special Agent
Caitlin Todd? Can we talk about her?

191
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:11,157
l saw her picture in <i>The Post</i>.
They said she was shot by a terrorist?

192
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:16,164
Did you cut back on the caffeine
like l told you?

193
00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:18,485
See you Saturday.

194
00:11:18,687 --> 00:11:21,724
Come on, Gibbs.
l was just having some fun with you.

195
00:11:21,927 --> 00:11:23,155
You can't leave.

196
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:25,961
You're here because you're following
orders like a good Marine.

197
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,441
Right, Gunny?

198
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:30,525
l'll tell you where they are.
Where they all are.

199
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,560
There's more than 22, Jethro.

200
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:35,764
Lots more.

201
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,197
- Where is he, Timothy?
- Who?

202
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:50,358
Gibbs, damn it.

203
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:54,686
Hey.

204
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:59,203
Do you know the difference between
good and bad cholesterol, Tony?

205
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:01,881
No, but l'm assuming
it has something to do with taste.

206
00:12:02,047 --> 00:12:04,925
Bad is what came back
on your last blood test.

207
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:06,799
- Dispose of this.
- Hey, hey, hey.

208
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:10,721
- That cost me 1 6 bucks, that pizza.
- You'll thank me when you're my age.

209
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:12,639
But you eat pizza all the time.

210
00:12:12,807 --> 00:12:14,877
- Exactly.
- l don't see the connection here.

211
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:17,800
Well, of course you wouldn't.
You're not a doctor.

212
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:21,322
- Where is Gibbs?
- Sussex State Prison.

213
00:12:21,527 --> 00:12:22,801
lnterviewing Kyle Boone.

214
00:12:23,047 --> 00:12:24,321
He said he wasn't going.

215
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:27,479
- He wasn't.
- Until the SECNAV ordered him to.

216
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,717
- Who's with him?
- No one.

217
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:32,277
Have you any idea the effect that
psychopath had

218
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:33,926
on Gibbs ten years ago?

219
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:37,603
Considering how open Gibbs is about
his personal life, no, not a clue.

220
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:40,203
He should not have gone alone.

221
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:42,684
Ducky, it's Gibbs.
l'm sure he'll be fine.

222
00:12:43,207 --> 00:12:46,882
lt's easy for you to say. You didn't have
to live through this the last time.

223
00:12:48,927 --> 00:12:50,201
- DiNozzo.
- <i>Get the truck.</i>

224
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:52,523
- Where?
- <i>Boone Farm. Bring Cassidy.</i>

225
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:54,400
Yeah, l got it, boss.

226
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,246
We're on our way. Cassidy, saddle up.
Gibbs wants you in the field.

227
00:12:57,407 --> 00:12:59,602
- Boone family farm.
- Wants me?

228
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:01,559
That's what he said.
Let's roll.

229
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:03,683
The difference between ten years ago
and today?

230
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,801
- We have Gibbs back.
- There's another difference, Tony.

231
00:13:08,007 --> 00:13:11,363
Ten years ago, Gibbs
was a very different man.

232
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:13,876
- You mean he was actually meaner?
- Oh, quite the opposite.

233
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:16,446
He was--

234
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:19,961
He was a lot like you.

235
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:30,841
What do we got?

236
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:36,441
l can save you the time, Gibbs.

237
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,201
- My measurements are 34--
- Twenty-six, 34.

238
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,037
A hundred and twenty pounds?
l'm right, aren't l?

239
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:45,085
Did you weigh and measure me
in my sleep?

240
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:48,205
l'm a crime scene sketch expert.
lt's what l do.

241
00:13:48,447 --> 00:13:50,085
- You'll do.
- Gibbs, again.

242
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,317
You have such a way
of making a gal feel so special.

243
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:53,846
Put this on.

244
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:54,996
- McGee?
- Yeah, boss?

245
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,317
You might wanna wear kneepads.

246
00:14:01,447 --> 00:14:03,961
- Do we even have kneepads?
- Equipment inventory is Kate's job.

247
00:14:04,127 --> 00:14:05,560
You might wanna ask--

248
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,999
Do you know
what the hell we're doing?

249
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:17,721
- Following Gibbs' lead?
- On what?

250
00:14:17,927 --> 00:14:19,246
- l don't know.
- You don't know

251
00:14:19,407 --> 00:14:23,241
- and that doesn't bother you at all?
- You get used to it.

252
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,045
Yeah, that's what l'm afraid of.

253
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:31,639
This place must have been gone
over a dozen times, boss.

254
00:14:31,807 --> 00:14:34,799
- No way there's any bodies in here.
- l'm not looking for bodies, Tony.

255
00:14:35,487 --> 00:14:38,240
Boone was raised here by his uncle.
His mother was a prostitute.

256
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:39,965
She left town when he was 1 2.

257
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,521
Then what are we looking for?

258
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,200
Proof. Boone swears it's here.

259
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:47,484
The only place we didn't look is inside
this chimney.

260
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:50,482
l think l got something.
No.

261
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:52,120
That's just another dead bird.

262
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:55,482
Oh, that's disgusting.

263
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:59,362
l'll bet this wasn't in the brochure
when you signed up for NClS, probie.

264
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,478
- You know, you were wrong earlier.
- About what?

265
00:15:01,647 --> 00:15:03,365
She weighs more than a buck twenty.

266
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:06,680
Sorry.

267
00:15:06,847 --> 00:15:09,077
- She did that on purpose.
- Okay. Oh, no. l got--

268
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:11,124
lt's right here by the flue.
l got it.

269
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,079
- Okay. l got it. l'm coming down.
- Finally.

270
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,165
You could have taken your boots--
Oh, jeez.

271
00:15:16,407 --> 00:15:18,045
My bad.

272
00:15:18,847 --> 00:15:21,077
Looks like a book.

273
00:15:42,127 --> 00:15:44,800
Oh, there must be 30 pages there.

274
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:46,645
More.

275
00:15:47,887 --> 00:15:50,242
What's carved into their backs?

276
00:15:50,487 --> 00:15:52,478
That's his calling card, McGee.

277
00:15:57,967 --> 00:15:59,161
Something wrong?

278
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:00,999
This section on my mother,
John, is better.

279
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:05,080
- But it still needs work.
- l was trying to humanize her, Kyle.

280
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:07,000
Don't.

281
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:10,279
You find it all right, Jethro?

282
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:12,685
l guess you wouldn't be here
if you didn't.

283
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,566
l don't believe you've met
my biographer, John Briggs.

284
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:17,877
Special Agent Gibbs, it is a pleasure.

285
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:20,436
l've been trying to schedule
an interview with you for months.

286
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:22,086
You're gonna have to leave now,
Briggs.

287
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:25,319
l've been granted special permission
by the State of Virginia to be here.

288
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,319
- Not anymore.
- Next time you see Boone,

289
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,398
he'll have a thunderbolt shooting out
of his ass.

290
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:33,196
Hey, l was guaranteed full access
for the next three days.

291
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:35,398
The warden asked you to leave.

292
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:37,239
Don't make him ask you again.

293
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:39,244
You'll have to excuse Agent Gibbs,
John.

294
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:42,445
He's finally gotten a glimpse into
the world l've been telling him about.

295
00:16:42,687 --> 00:16:44,325
The scrapbook?

296
00:16:44,527 --> 00:16:46,882
You found his scrapbook?
When will it be released?

297
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:49,243
Son, if you wanna walk out of here
under your own power

298
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,637
l suggest you leave now.

299
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:01,798
John really is a wonderful writer.

300
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:04,641
You know, he spent years trying
to understand me.

301
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:07,401
Unfortunately, he just never seemed
to measure up.

302
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:09,205
To who?

303
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:11,045
Your prostitute mom?

304
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:15,479
Or your father? Some hick john
with a few extra bucks in his pocket?

305
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:18,081
Actually, l was referring to you, Jethro.

306
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,315
Show's over.
Where is the dumping ground?

307
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:23,319
You show me my scrapbook
one last time

308
00:17:23,527 --> 00:17:26,041
and l'll draw you a map
even a Marine can follow.

309
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:28,920
No. They've suffered enough.

310
00:17:29,127 --> 00:17:30,719
Well, we're at an impasse.

311
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:33,441
You gonna keep playing
this game with me, Boone?

312
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:38,276
l have never considered
any of this a game, Jethro.

313
00:17:38,527 --> 00:17:41,246
- You know that.
- Whatever. l'm changing the rules.

314
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:43,199
- How so?
- l've seen your world.

315
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:47,878
Now you're gonna spend what's left
of your miserable life in mine.

316
00:17:58,247 --> 00:18:00,203
All right, listen up,
my probationary field agents.

317
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:03,280
You are about to witness the transfer
of a maximum-security prisoner

318
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:04,436
to our humble facility.

319
00:18:04,607 --> 00:18:07,167
While he's here,
he's our sole responsibility.

320
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:11,356
- Oh, l'm sorry. Am l boring you?
- My God, does he ever stop?

321
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:13,757
l'm just glad it's not me.

322
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:17,722
lt's 1 0:00. lt doesn't make sense
bringing Boone here now.

323
00:18:17,887 --> 00:18:20,117
Gibbs is trying to put him
on unfamiliar ground.

324
00:18:20,327 --> 00:18:23,125
- Throw him off balance.
- Because that worked ten years ago?

325
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:26,202
- What's different now?
- l am, Cassidy.

326
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:29,404
Stand tall.
Wake up, probies.

327
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:46,400
l knew l could
count on you, Jethro.

328
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:52,523
lt's good to be home again.

329
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:59,006
Yep, good to be home.

330
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:06,037
The guy's been impersonating
a statue all night.

331
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:08,437
According to the watch,
he hasn't moved a muscle.

332
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:10,196
He's creepy.

333
00:19:10,407 --> 00:19:13,399
When is Gibbs gonna start
his interrogation?

334
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:15,956
- When he's ready.
- You might wanna tell him to hurry.

335
00:19:16,127 --> 00:19:20,006
He's got less than 48 hours before
Boone's scheduled to be executed.

336
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:23,037
l've got a better idea, Paula.

337
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:24,566
Why don't you tell him?

338
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:27,638
Because l'm not stupid.

339
00:19:27,807 --> 00:19:29,081
No.

340
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:31,358
Of all the things you are,

341
00:19:31,647 --> 00:19:33,603
stupid definitely isn't one of them.

342
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:36,920
Thank you.

343
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,317
- Okay, what's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

344
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:44,359
- By the way, how's Bobert?
- Why, are you jealous?

345
00:19:45,127 --> 00:19:46,845
Of a lawyer?
Give me a break.

346
00:19:47,007 --> 00:19:49,282
- He's very rich.
- Money isn't everything.

347
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:51,438
He's got season tickets
to the Redskins.

348
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:54,036
- Private skybox.
- l'm happy for him.

349
00:19:54,207 --> 00:19:55,560
And l almost forgot

350
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:59,006
he drives a Ferrari.

351
00:20:00,807 --> 00:20:02,525
Red.

352
00:20:03,087 --> 00:20:05,078
Like Magnum.

353
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:07,482
Well, that's nice.

354
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:09,605
lsn't it?

355
00:20:09,807 --> 00:20:12,116
You know what's even nicer?

356
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:13,920
My current view.

357
00:20:14,127 --> 00:20:16,595
Victoria's Secret?
Agent Cassidy.

358
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,486
Well, you enjoy it as long as you can,
Agent DiNozzo

359
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:21,877
because that's as close
as you're gonna get.

360
00:20:23,007 --> 00:20:24,156
Cassidy?

361
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:28,198
Check Boone's security detail.

362
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:30,358
You got it.

363
00:20:30,527 --> 00:20:32,916
- l'll give her a hand with that.
- Wait.

364
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:41,719
- What was that for?
- Letting her get to you.

365
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:43,525
Boss, l was not letting her get--

366
00:20:44,847 --> 00:20:46,997
l won't let it happen again.

367
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,805
- Thanks.
- lt's for Abby.

368
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:55,403
Go find out how many victims
she lD'd from Boone's scrapbook.

369
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:21,915
There were 27 women
in the scrapbook, McGee.

370
00:21:22,087 --> 00:21:24,555
As far as l can tell, they're in the order
that they were killed.

371
00:21:24,727 --> 00:21:27,036
Now, Boone has admitted
to killing 22

372
00:21:27,247 --> 00:21:30,842
which matches with the photos
in the files that the FBl sent over.

373
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:34,079
Which would make you think
that we'd be left with five Jane Does,

374
00:21:34,287 --> 00:21:38,997
but you'd be wrong because l know
who the first victim is.

375
00:21:39,807 --> 00:21:41,923
You're not listening
to a word l'm saying.

376
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:44,838
l'm pregnant, McGee.

377
00:21:45,327 --> 00:21:46,521
Twins.

378
00:21:46,727 --> 00:21:48,604
Haven't told the father yet.

379
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:51,847
lt's Gibbs. l know it's wrong

380
00:21:52,047 --> 00:21:54,800
but something about his silver hair
just gets me all tingly inside.

381
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:56,764
Excuse me for a sec.
l think l'm gonna vomit.

382
00:21:57,087 --> 00:21:58,679
l'm joking, Tony.

383
00:21:58,847 --> 00:22:00,678
Except for the part about Gibbs' hair.

384
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,605
That is really hot.

385
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:05,565
- McGee is ignoring me again.
- Easily fixable.

386
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,835
- What? What'd l do?
- Stop ignoring Abby. She's sensitive.

387
00:22:09,047 --> 00:22:10,241
l'm sorry. l was concentrating.

388
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:12,398
l think that l know how we can find
Boone's victims

389
00:22:12,607 --> 00:22:14,040
without Gibbs having to talk to him.

390
00:22:14,287 --> 00:22:17,085
There are distinctive geographical
and man-made features

391
00:22:17,287 --> 00:22:18,436
in several of these pictures.

392
00:22:18,727 --> 00:22:21,605
Here's a stream
and what may be a bridge.

393
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:24,719
Up here appears to be a power line.

394
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,804
Or some dirt on a picture.

395
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:30,079
lf l can make a land plot, create scale
by computing the distances

396
00:22:30,247 --> 00:22:33,922
- between these points, then we can--
- Okay, streams and power lines?

397
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:37,085
lt would take years searching just one
county, McGee. Never mind a state.

398
00:22:37,247 --> 00:22:39,363
Yeah, for us, Tony.
But not for a computer.

399
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,717
Satellite imagery?
l should have thought of that.

400
00:22:41,887 --> 00:22:44,355
l need to figure a way
to calculate an accurate scale.

401
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:46,239
Polaroid cameras have
a fixed focal length.

402
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,637
That's a good start. l'm gonna need
one known measurement.

403
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:51,924
- Pick one body and l'll pull her stats.
- Three known vectors should do it.

404
00:22:52,087 --> 00:22:53,918
Okay. Okay.
Enough with the geek-speak.

405
00:22:54,127 --> 00:22:56,004
Gibbs wants to know how
many victims we lD'd.

406
00:22:56,207 --> 00:22:58,801
All except for the last four
in the scrapbook.

407
00:22:59,007 --> 00:23:01,237
We're running them
against missing persons reports

408
00:23:01,407 --> 00:23:04,001
prior to Gibbs putting Boone
behind bars. No matches yet.

409
00:23:04,207 --> 00:23:07,483
The one that stands out the most
is the first victim.

410
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:10,121
She disappeared in 1 97 4.

411
00:23:10,327 --> 00:23:12,204
Are you sure about that, Abs?

412
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:14,079
Boone was just a kid back then.

413
00:23:14,287 --> 00:23:17,802
l know. And it turns out his mother
did not abandon him.

414
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:20,885
She was his first kill.

415
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:32,119
You don't have to do this again,
you know.

416
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:34,880
You're wrong, Duck. l do.

417
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:38,521
He's never gonna tell you
where those poor girls are.

418
00:23:38,687 --> 00:23:41,565
- l know that.
- Then why?

419
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,481
Because ten years ago
l couldn't break him.

420
00:23:45,727 --> 00:23:47,683
No, but you did
what no one else could.

421
00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:50,765
- You caught the son of a bitch.
- l should have killed him.

422
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:54,079
And in two days that will be rectified.

423
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,356
l'm telling you as a friend.

424
00:23:57,607 --> 00:23:59,837
lt's time to let this one go.

425
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:01,241
Not yet, Ducky.

426
00:24:01,447 --> 00:24:04,166
You already lost one relationship
as a result of this case.

427
00:24:04,327 --> 00:24:05,646
She was a wonderful girl.

428
00:24:05,887 --> 00:24:09,562
- And you neglected--
- She left me, Duck. l didn't leave her.

429
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:13,442
No.
You made it impossible for her to stay.

430
00:24:17,887 --> 00:24:20,685
Okay, send him up.
Make sure he's escorted.

431
00:24:20,887 --> 00:24:22,400
l'll let Gibbs know.

432
00:24:24,327 --> 00:24:25,726
Comfortable?

433
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:28,920
- Yeah, as a matter of fact--
- lt was a rhetorical question, lady.

434
00:24:29,127 --> 00:24:32,164
Wow, l never realized how sensitive
you were about your desk.

435
00:24:32,367 --> 00:24:34,278
There's a lot about me
you don't realise, Cassidy.

436
00:24:34,447 --> 00:24:36,403
- Where's Gibbs?
- lnterrogation.

437
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:38,643
Boone's lawyer is here.
He claims he wasn't notified

438
00:24:38,847 --> 00:24:41,407
about his client's being moved
and he wants to talk to him.

439
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:43,717
Gibbs doesn't like to be kept waiting.

440
00:24:43,887 --> 00:24:45,479
You better go right in there

441
00:24:46,007 --> 00:24:48,919
and tell him yourself. l'll get the suit.

442
00:24:52,927 --> 00:24:54,599
Finally.

443
00:24:55,207 --> 00:24:57,437
So where should we start this time,
Jethro?

444
00:24:57,647 --> 00:24:58,841
My childhood?

445
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:01,356
l didn't bring you in here to talk, Boone.

446
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:04,206
So you decided to let me see
my photographs again?

447
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:06,642
l told you that's not gonna happen.

448
00:25:06,847 --> 00:25:09,645
lnteresting.
May l ask why l'm here then?

449
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:13,078
The state is hoping
that l'll get the location of your victims.

450
00:25:13,287 --> 00:25:15,517
l believe that requires some form
of communication.

451
00:25:15,687 --> 00:25:18,599
l said the state. Me?

452
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:20,316
l'm not even gonna try.

453
00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:23,724
But you always try, Jethro.
That's why l like you.

454
00:25:23,927 --> 00:25:26,361
l've taken you out of the system,
Boone.

455
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:30,401
You're gonna sit here, alone, without
any human contact until you fry.

456
00:25:30,607 --> 00:25:32,040
The game ends now.

457
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:38,644
This room brings back
so many memories, doesn't it?

458
00:25:40,527 --> 00:25:42,518
Special Agent Gibbs, a word please?

459
00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:44,763
Sounds like you replaced
your dead female.

460
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:47,438
Any chance l can meet this one?

461
00:25:53,407 --> 00:25:55,716
Well, l'll be here if you need me.

462
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:00,884
- What?
- Boone's attorney is here.

463
00:26:01,087 --> 00:26:04,045
The DA's afraid if we deny him access,
he'll find a sympathetic judge

464
00:26:04,207 --> 00:26:06,516
- and have the execution delayed.
- l got it.

465
00:26:07,327 --> 00:26:10,478
Look, l need a privileged conversation
with my client.

466
00:26:10,687 --> 00:26:13,155
Meaning, Agent Gibbs,
l want your observation room cleared

467
00:26:13,327 --> 00:26:15,966
and all microphones turned off.

468
00:26:16,127 --> 00:26:19,324
- That's it, counsellor?
- For now, agent.

469
00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:20,922
Tony?

470
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:26,523
- Yeah, hold on a second.
- Search him first thoroughly.

471
00:26:34,607 --> 00:26:35,960
l'm impressed.

472
00:26:36,407 --> 00:26:38,762
- lt's actually working.
- Thank you.

473
00:26:39,287 --> 00:26:41,755
Now all we have to do is scan
through 800,000 miles

474
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,003
of satellite imagery,
and pray we get lucky.

475
00:26:45,407 --> 00:26:46,920
l am a scientist, McGee.

476
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:49,601
Luck has nothing to do with it
and/or us.

477
00:26:50,607 --> 00:26:53,724
Okay, then how do you explain
something like Gibbs' gut?

478
00:26:53,927 --> 00:26:56,839
Well, that's easy. Gibbs is lucky.

479
00:26:57,047 --> 00:27:00,642
- But you just said that--
- He's not a scientist.

480
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:04,561
Agent Gibbs,

481
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:06,678
if anything happens to my client while
he's here,

482
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:09,281
l want you to know l am gonna hold
you personally responsible--

483
00:27:09,447 --> 00:27:12,644
You have my word he will be
in perfect health for his execution.

484
00:27:13,647 --> 00:27:17,322
Escort Mr. O'Neill out of my building,
Special Agent Cassidy.

485
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:19,165
You'll be hearing from me.

486
00:27:19,407 --> 00:27:20,920
Let's go.

487
00:27:21,527 --> 00:27:23,358
You going back in there, boss?

488
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:25,958
Yeah, maybe. Gibbs.

489
00:27:26,327 --> 00:27:27,316
<i>Gibbs, it's Abby.</i>

490
00:27:27,487 --> 00:27:29,079
<i>We think we found Boone's</i>
<i>dumping ground.</i>

491
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,966
<i>We've got it on a screen in my lab.</i>

492
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:34,482
They think they may have found
his dumping ground.

493
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,519
- What am l looking at?
- Take it away, McGee.

494
00:27:44,447 --> 00:27:47,644
l mean, very Special Agent McGee.

495
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:51,965
Probable site where the victims
were tortured, killed, perhaps buried.

496
00:27:52,927 --> 00:27:54,280
- You wanna know how?
- Not really.

497
00:27:54,487 --> 00:27:56,284
Good, because it was mostly luck.

498
00:27:56,487 --> 00:27:58,796
Where? Wilderness area
at Great Falls National Park.

499
00:27:59,007 --> 00:28:01,123
- Tony, you lead the team.
- Where are you going, boss?

500
00:28:01,287 --> 00:28:03,198
After ten years, l finally got something
on Boone

501
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:04,925
he doesn't already know about.

502
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,598
My lawyer was very upset.

503
00:28:07,807 --> 00:28:10,844
He wanted to move me back to prison.
But don't worry.

504
00:28:11,047 --> 00:28:13,880
- l told him l like it here.
- Don't get too comfortable.

505
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:15,606
You're going back today.

506
00:28:15,807 --> 00:28:17,718
Really? What's changed?

507
00:28:18,527 --> 00:28:20,757
You found something, didn't you?

508
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:34,956
The site where the photos were taken
is 265 feet

509
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:38,284
on a track of 31 0 degrees.
We need to get through here.

510
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:41,486
Okay.

511
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:44,406
Remember what l told you
about the poison ivy, all right?

512
00:28:44,607 --> 00:28:46,723
- Don't tell Cassidy.
- What?

513
00:28:46,927 --> 00:28:48,485
Nothing.

514
00:28:48,767 --> 00:28:50,325
Follow me.

515
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,597
l'm okay. l'm okay.

516
00:28:58,327 --> 00:29:01,603
This is steep.
Watch yourselves.

517
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:12,357
Well, if this is the place
l can see why Boone picked it.

518
00:29:12,607 --> 00:29:16,236
Off the beaten path,
no hard surfaces to reflect sound.

519
00:29:16,447 --> 00:29:19,245
Those girls could scream
their heads off and no one would hear.

520
00:29:19,607 --> 00:29:21,996
Yeah, this is the perfect spot.

521
00:30:00,447 --> 00:30:01,562
Guys,

522
00:30:01,847 --> 00:30:03,121
we're in the right place.

523
00:30:09,047 --> 00:30:11,880
No reception.
Spread out, tape it off.

524
00:30:12,127 --> 00:30:14,402
We'll hike back and call Gibbs.

525
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:19,521
Come on, Jethro.

526
00:30:20,447 --> 00:30:23,041
We both know you're in there.

527
00:30:27,087 --> 00:30:29,396
- Hey.
- Hey.

528
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:31,639
- What are you doing here?
- l wanted to see

529
00:30:31,807 --> 00:30:33,081
what the monster looks like.

530
00:30:38,847 --> 00:30:40,838
He doesn't look that scary.

531
00:30:42,647 --> 00:30:44,603
You saw the photographs?

532
00:30:44,807 --> 00:30:46,559
Yeah.

533
00:30:53,967 --> 00:30:57,243
You did good, McGee.
l'm proud of you.

534
00:30:57,407 --> 00:30:58,999
And?

535
00:30:59,487 --> 00:31:00,476
And what?

536
00:31:00,647 --> 00:31:03,161
Well, usually, you add
some kind of insult at the end.

537
00:31:03,327 --> 00:31:04,680
No, l don't.

538
00:31:04,927 --> 00:31:07,361
Well, okay, maybe sometimes.

539
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:11,162
- But the point is, we're a team.
- Tony?

540
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:17,605
You all right?

541
00:31:17,887 --> 00:31:20,117
l was a little startled.

542
00:31:20,327 --> 00:31:21,521
By what?

543
00:31:21,727 --> 00:31:23,683
Her.

544
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:36,719
She couldn't have been dead
more than a few days.

545
00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:40,760
Tony, you're not gonna believe it.

546
00:31:41,927 --> 00:31:43,485
Boone's mark.

547
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:57,718
l-- l can't get any reception out here.

548
00:31:58,687 --> 00:32:00,325
That's not surprising.

549
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:02,597
Butt-nowhere isn't part
of our coverage plan.

550
00:32:02,807 --> 00:32:05,560
l'm gonna head back to the truck
and try and get the call through.

551
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:08,520
Okay, tell Gibbs we're gonna need
everything and everyone on this one.

552
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:09,961
l'll be back in 20 minutes.

553
00:32:23,847 --> 00:32:25,280
Yeah, Gibbs.

554
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:26,721
Gibbs.

555
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:28,798
- We found Boone's dumping ground.
- <i>Good work.</i>

556
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:31,800
- Tell Tony he needs to call--
- <i>We also found a fresh body.</i>

557
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:33,719
Female.
Dead less than a week.

558
00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:35,957
She has Boone's mark on her back.

559
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:39,045
l think we're definitely dealing
with a copycat killer.

560
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:43,642
- Gibbs? Gibbs, can you hear me?
- Yeah, l heard you.

561
00:32:43,807 --> 00:32:45,877
l want the area sealed off.
l'm on my way.

562
00:32:53,887 --> 00:32:55,320
Tony.

563
00:32:56,287 --> 00:32:58,562
- Something's not right.
- No, nothing has been

564
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,877
since Boone showed up at NClS.

565
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:03,163
No. No, l know this girl.

566
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:06,203
You know her?
How?

567
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:09,006
You know her too. She was
the last entry in Boone's scrapbook.

568
00:33:09,207 --> 00:33:10,526
One of the Jane Does.

569
00:33:11,647 --> 00:33:14,400
He's been on death row for ten years,
McGee.

570
00:33:14,607 --> 00:33:18,395
She's been here less than a week.
That's not possible.

571
00:33:25,407 --> 00:33:26,726
lt can't be.

572
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:36,042
You look a little peaked, Jethro.

573
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,124
ls something wrong?

574
00:33:38,447 --> 00:33:40,005
Maybe l can help.

575
00:33:40,207 --> 00:33:43,404
A new development, perhaps?

576
00:33:43,807 --> 00:33:45,035
l gotta hand it to you, Boone.

577
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:47,485
l did my best.

578
00:33:47,687 --> 00:33:50,121
But you got me to play your game.
Congratulations.

579
00:33:51,127 --> 00:33:53,516
You found the bodies. Good.

580
00:33:53,727 --> 00:33:56,366
Not what you were expecting,
was it?

581
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,398
You see, there's someone else
out there, now.

582
00:33:58,607 --> 00:33:59,960
A new threat.

583
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:02,806
And l'm the only one
who can help you find him.

584
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:05,758
You'll have to request a stay
of my execution.

585
00:34:07,127 --> 00:34:09,561
l'm gonna have to pass on that.

586
00:34:10,727 --> 00:34:14,242
No matter how this plays out,
you're gonna sit in that chair Saturday.

587
00:34:14,447 --> 00:34:17,007
You can't have changed this much.
You have a sworn duty.

588
00:34:17,407 --> 00:34:18,965
Maybe. Ten years ago.

589
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:21,203
Now, hell.

590
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:23,443
l can wait till Sunday
to start an investigation.

591
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:26,605
- You're bluffing.
- You're dead in 36 hours.

592
00:34:26,807 --> 00:34:29,560
Yeah, well, l'll be here
when you change your mind.

593
00:34:45,447 --> 00:34:47,278
Cassidy.

594
00:34:49,327 --> 00:34:50,555
Cassidy.

595
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:53,000
Great. She's lost.

596
00:34:53,207 --> 00:34:56,119
Why didn't you give her
your GPS thingy, probie?

597
00:34:57,007 --> 00:34:58,281
She's not lost.

598
00:34:59,527 --> 00:35:01,040
What's going on?

599
00:35:03,007 --> 00:35:04,201
She's been kidnapped.

600
00:35:05,487 --> 00:35:07,000
McGee, where is my list
of every visitor

601
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:09,237
and phone call Boone's
had since he's been in prison?

602
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,398
- l'm working it, boss.
- Tony?

603
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:15,641
- Tony. Backup team's in place?
- Yeah.

604
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,358
l never should have let her
take off alone, boss.

605
00:35:19,127 --> 00:35:22,961
The Polaroid of Cassidy is clean.
No prints, no DNA. l'm sorry, Gibbs.

606
00:35:23,127 --> 00:35:24,924
- l screwed this thing up.
- You screwed it up?

607
00:35:25,087 --> 00:35:27,078
We should have known
there was more than one killer.

608
00:35:27,247 --> 00:35:29,636
l only ran the Jane Does
up until the time Boone was captured.

609
00:35:29,847 --> 00:35:31,803
All four have gone missing
the last three years.

610
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:34,237
Concentrate on Boone's contacts
over the past three years.

611
00:35:34,407 --> 00:35:35,601
Yeah.

612
00:35:36,607 --> 00:35:37,722
We can't lose another agent.

613
00:35:38,127 --> 00:35:39,480
- l can't take this.
- Okay.

614
00:35:39,647 --> 00:35:41,603
Our best bet is a guy named
John Frederick Briggs.

615
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:44,565
ln the last three years,
he's logged 229 phone calls

616
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,200
and visited Boone
96 times.

617
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:47,595
He's writing Boone's biography.

618
00:35:47,807 --> 00:35:49,798
- He's living it.
- He's off to a good start.

619
00:35:49,967 --> 00:35:51,923
Dishonourable discharge
from the Army in '91 .

620
00:35:52,127 --> 00:35:54,243
Arrested for domestic disturbance
in 2000

621
00:35:54,407 --> 00:35:56,045
- for beating his girlfriend.
- Find him.

622
00:35:56,247 --> 00:35:57,726
Home address
and cell phone number.

623
00:35:57,887 --> 00:36:00,685
- Find out if his cell has a GPS locator.
- Checked the carrier.

624
00:36:00,887 --> 00:36:03,447
lt does and it can be remotely activated
if it's reported stolen.

625
00:36:03,607 --> 00:36:05,199
- Good job, McGee.
- Good job, McGee.

626
00:36:05,367 --> 00:36:06,516
Let's roll.

627
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:20,238
Okay, Briggs' cell provider
is relaying us his location.

628
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:23,245
- He's in movement.
- He's headed out of D.C. on 1 90 west.

629
00:36:29,447 --> 00:36:31,039
He's getting off the 1 90 at Oakley.

630
00:36:31,247 --> 00:36:33,681
lf you get off at MacArthur,
you might make it before him.

631
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:40,721
- How far ahead is he?
- <i>Less than a mile.</i>

632
00:36:46,807 --> 00:36:48,445
That's gotta be him.

633
00:36:58,727 --> 00:37:00,365
Keep your hands on the wheel.
Keep them up.

634
00:37:01,007 --> 00:37:02,520
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

635
00:37:02,727 --> 00:37:04,001
Where is she, Briggs?

636
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:07,605
Okay.
Okay, l have every right to be here.

637
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:10,158
Heard from a guard
you found the bodies.

638
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:13,923
- l wanna see them.
- Shut up.

639
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:23,877
Hello.

640
00:37:34,527 --> 00:37:36,040
What did you do to me?

641
00:37:38,087 --> 00:37:41,079
l hit you in the head with a shovel,
my dear.

642
00:37:41,407 --> 00:37:44,046
- Did you kill that woman we found?
- l did.

643
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:48,162
How many more are there, O'Neill?

644
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:49,686
Let's see, there was...

645
00:37:49,847 --> 00:37:52,566
There was one, and then
there's two, three, four.

646
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:54,759
You will make five.

647
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,877
How did Boone turn his lawyer
into his replacement?

648
00:38:01,047 --> 00:38:04,960
You really think l'm Boone's lawyer
by coincidence? Come on.

649
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:08,000
See, l--
l sought Boone out.

650
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:11,475
Why?

651
00:38:11,687 --> 00:38:13,439
So l could learn from him.

652
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:15,606
Learn from the best.

653
00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:19,436
And you,
you're my graduation present.

654
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:29,955
You know, you can scream
if you want to. lt's allowed.

655
00:38:35,567 --> 00:38:37,637
Kyle says he wants Agent Gibbs
to remember him

656
00:38:37,807 --> 00:38:40,799
for a long, long time
after he's gone.

657
00:38:41,007 --> 00:38:42,520
So you and me

658
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:46,999
we're gonna take this nice and slow.

659
00:38:55,887 --> 00:38:57,002
Fighter, huh?

660
00:38:57,647 --> 00:38:59,638
l haven't had one of those before.

661
00:38:59,807 --> 00:39:01,525
Try that thing again with that knife--

662
00:39:01,687 --> 00:39:04,201
You wanted to see your scrapbook?

663
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:07,117
Where is my agent?

664
00:39:15,407 --> 00:39:17,079
Stop.

665
00:39:17,527 --> 00:39:18,642
Stop--

666
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:22,039
Look, you don't know what--

667
00:39:22,287 --> 00:39:23,686
You don't know what you're doing.

668
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:28,041
- Jethro. Don't.
- Damn it.

669
00:39:29,047 --> 00:39:31,880
l don't know where she is.
How can l?

670
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:37,321
Gibbs, please. Just let me see
them one last time. Please.

671
00:39:37,527 --> 00:39:39,006
l'm begging you.

672
00:39:39,727 --> 00:39:42,799
Where is she?

673
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:51,203
We all know
you can't destroy evidence.

674
00:39:51,407 --> 00:39:53,238
Pathetic, Jethro.

675
00:39:54,567 --> 00:39:56,842
Do you really think that l need that
to see them?

676
00:39:57,407 --> 00:40:00,205
When they're all up here,
anytime l want?

677
00:40:01,247 --> 00:40:02,726
Your agent is gonna suffer.

678
00:40:02,927 --> 00:40:05,646
The obscenities unleashed on her,
legendary. You know why?

679
00:40:05,807 --> 00:40:09,197
Because you're the one
that stopped me. This is all your fault.

680
00:40:12,807 --> 00:40:16,686
He's cutting her tongue
out of her mouth right now.

681
00:40:17,287 --> 00:40:18,766
And you know the best part?

682
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:20,724
After l'm gone

683
00:40:20,927 --> 00:40:23,725
bodies are just gonna continue
to pile up.

684
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:26,918
Shoot me.

685
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:31,601
You're supposed to shoot me,
you idiot!

686
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:35,686
That the big plan you spent
ten years working on?

687
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:41,643
Get me to murder you
and ruin my own life?

688
00:40:44,207 --> 00:40:46,198
He's carving your name
in her back right now.

689
00:40:46,407 --> 00:40:49,319
Game's over.
Back to death row.

690
00:40:50,527 --> 00:40:51,562
Gibbs.

691
00:40:54,247 --> 00:40:57,125
The governor call yet? Because they're
not gonna kill me now.

692
00:40:57,327 --> 00:40:59,477
l'm the only one
who can identify the killer.

693
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:04,083
Do you think she screamed
when he cut out her tongue, Jethro?

694
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:05,282
l don't know.

695
00:41:05,487 --> 00:41:07,842
Why don't you ask her yourself?

696
00:41:10,047 --> 00:41:12,561
l'm afraid your lawyer is gonna miss
your execution tomorrow.

697
00:41:12,727 --> 00:41:14,797
He's kind of dead.

698
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:17,205
Enjoy hell.

699
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:22,726
No. No! No!



9999
