1
00:00:03,834 --> 00:00:07,101
I will never forget the day
that Gibbs caught this psycho.

2
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:08,767
You knew Gibbs
back then?

3
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:12,201
No. I was a junior
at Georgetown.

4
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:13,800
And for two years,

5
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:16,368
every woman in D.C. was
afraid to go out at night.

6
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:18,067
Must have been tough.

7
00:00:18,134 --> 00:00:19,334
Yeah, you have no idea.

8
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:21,201
I actually owe Gibbs
for the first

9
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:23,101
full night of sleep
I got in college.

10
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:24,434
Mm, I meant dating.

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,600
Yes, yes, dating was tough.

12
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,234
Need any help
with that now, Paula?

13
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:32,700
No, Tony, thank you.

14
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:34,734
I've been there
and I've done that.

15
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:37,234
Ouch.

16
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:39,600
Your problem with women
is where you're focused.

17
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:40,734
Where?

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,034
Mm...

19
00:00:45,468 --> 00:00:46,600
Here.

20
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:47,900
It's a mirror.

21
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:49,867
Quick question.

22
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:52,067
The pink ones.
Oh!

23
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:53,500
Do they taste
like strawberry starburst?

24
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:54,934
I thought you said you
weren't seeing anyone.

25
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:56,401
I'm not.

26
00:00:56,468 --> 00:00:57,401
Hmm?

27
00:00:57,468 --> 00:00:59,734
It's for my complexion.

28
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,101
Complexion got a name?

29
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:04,034
Tony, you so don't
want to go there.

30
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:05,434
Just tell me it's
not another agent,

31
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,834
'cause I really
don't think I can...

32
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:12,167
His name's Bob,

33
00:01:12,234 --> 00:01:13,834
and he's a lawyer.

34
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,334
What a coincidence.

35
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:17,034
I hate lawyers.

36
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:18,834
I know. So do I.

37
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,967
( <i>whispers</i> ):
That's why it's purely
a sexual relationship.

38
00:01:21,034 --> 00:01:23,034
Well, what would
that make me?

39
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:24,700
A big mistake.

40
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:27,368
If you do not give me
my birth control pills,

41
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:28,834
I'm going to break your arm.

42
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,301
Got that coffee.

43
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:33,633
Have you been there long?

44
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,900
Uh, long enough to say,
"No, ma'am, Agent Cassidy."

45
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:38,700
Okay, good answer.

46
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,434
Thank you.

47
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:45,667
I let her do that.

48
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:47,267
Thank you.

49
00:01:47,334 --> 00:01:49,700
Who's that?

50
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:52,001
Kyle Boone.

51
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:54,134
He's an infamous
serial killer, Probie--

52
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:56,167
terrorized the District
in the 90s. Come on.

53
00:01:56,234 --> 00:01:58,533
CASSIDY:
22 women went missing
and five bodies were found.

54
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,334
TONY:
Guy only made one mistake.

55
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:03,267
He killed a petty officer.

56
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:04,867
Gibbs caught him?

57
00:02:04,934 --> 00:02:07,900
Scheduled for a government-
sanctioned dirt-nap on Saturday.

58
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:10,867
He wants to talk to Gibbs
before they flip the switch.

59
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:12,267
Why?

60
00:02:12,334 --> 00:02:13,834
Claims he's gonna tell
them where the bodies are.

61
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,734
What the hell is that doing
on my screen?

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,533
Uh, I didn't put it
there, boss.

63
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,001
Who did, McGee?

64
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:23,667
Probie, let me
handle this.

65
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:25,834
TONY:
Boss...

66
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,934
she did it.

67
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,001
We heard you were
interviewing...

68
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:38,101
Kyle Boone, and we assumed that
we would be providing backup.

69
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:40,368
You heard wrong, Cassidy.

70
00:02:40,434 --> 00:02:41,434
I'm not interviewing anyone.

71
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,700
Oh, well, then
you might want

72
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:44,600
to let the Governor of Virginia
know, since MTAC

73
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,867
has him standing by,
waiting for your call.

74
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:52,034
Find her a desk.

75
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:54,134
Is that one...

76
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:55,533
No, it's taken.

77
00:02:57,533 --> 00:02:59,934
A whole week of
T.A.D. with Gibbs.

78
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:01,600
I can smell the fun already.

79
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,301
Well, it's been a tough month.

80
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:05,767
Right now he pretty much
hates everyone, Paula.

81
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:08,633
Including himself.

82
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,600
GOVERNOR:
I was told by your Director
that you would personally

83
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:14,267
be interviewing Kyle Boone
this afternoon, Agent Gibbs.

84
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:16,800
GIBBS:
Director Shepard was
misinformed, Governor.

85
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:19,267
Talking to Kyle Boone
would be a waste of time.

86
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:22,368
Possibly, but if there's even
a chance that he would reveal

87
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:25,001
to you the location of his
victims, we have to take it.

88
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:26,201
I disagree, sir.

89
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:27,700
He's had ten years
to think about it.

90
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:29,034
Why the change of heart now?

91
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:32,434
In my experience,
men facing imminent death

92
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,667
tend to reevaluate the course
of their lives.

93
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:38,667
Most seek forgiveness.

94
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:40,201
You trust me, sir.

95
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:41,401
Boone had a lot of interests.

96
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:46,034
Forgiveness wasn't one of them.

97
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,468
How can you be so sure?

98
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:49,567
I spent five months
interrogating him.

99
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:50,567
A decade ago.

100
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:51,567
People change.

101
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:53,134
People, sir.

102
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:54,600
Maybe.

103
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,900
Not Kyle Boone.

104
00:03:56,967 --> 00:03:59,900
Are you refusing
to meet with him?

105
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:02,533
I'm refusing to entertain
a homicidal maniac

106
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,134
who tortured and killed
22 women, sir.

107
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:08,767
I have played that game before.

108
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:11,334
And the hundreds of family
members who lost a daughter

109
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:12,767
a sister or a mother?

110
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:14,267
What do I tell them?

111
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:16,500
That no matter Kyle Boone says
in the next few days,

112
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:20,500
come Saturday, sir, you're
going to make sure he fries.

113
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:23,667
We all owe you a debt of
gratitude for bringing him

114
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:25,533
to justice, Agent Gibbs,

115
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,167
but, uh... you leave me
little choice.

116
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:31,468
I am sorry.

117
00:04:36,434 --> 00:04:39,700
Sir! We've got a high
priority transmission

118
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:41,533
coming through
for you in MTAC.

119
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,001
From who?

120
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:44,700
Secretary of the Navy.

121
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:58,201
Well, look
on the bright side.

122
00:04:58,267 --> 00:04:59,001
What is the
bright side?

123
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:01,334
You're only here a week.

124
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:04,633
Why couldn't I sit
at Kate's desk?

125
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,134
Mostly, because
it's still Kate's desk.

126
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:09,401
She was a great agent.

127
00:05:09,468 --> 00:05:11,234
Yep.

128
00:05:11,301 --> 00:05:13,600
How are you handling it?

129
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:15,667
Same way I handle
everything--

130
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:17,500
try not to
think about it.

131
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,567
And when that doesn't work?

132
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:21,734
There's always
junk food.

133
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,600
Doesn't sound
very healthy, Tony.

134
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:26,500
It's either that or I start
building a boat in my basement.

135
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:27,934
Did you move
from your apartment?

136
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:30,600
No. Now you see
my dilemma.

137
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:32,267
Hey.

138
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:34,934
If you ever do want to talk
about it, I'm here for you.

139
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,101
Okay?

140
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:38,934
You mean that?

141
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:41,234
Yes, of course I mean that.

142
00:05:41,301 --> 00:05:44,767
Okay.

143
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:48,234
Well, then, let me
ask you something.

144
00:05:48,301 --> 00:05:50,633
What's Bobbie like in bed?

145
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,834
Kate was right.

146
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,734
You are truly, truly
pathetic, DiNozzo.

147
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,734
Uh, you two might
want to get busy.

148
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,234
Gibbs's headed this way
and he looks pissed.

149
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:04,567
Think he caved
to the Governor?

150
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:06,001
No way.
No way.

151
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:07,001
If Gibbs doesn't want to
do something, he doesn't.

152
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,067
No matter who's asking.

153
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:15,500
Where you going, boss?

154
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:17,533
Sussex State Prison,
interviewing Kyle Boone.

155
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,734
Be gone the rest
of the day.

156
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,900
Yep, you two sure
have him pegged.

157
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:25,101
We moved Boone
to death watch on Monday.

158
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:27,734
That's when he decided
he wanted to talk.

159
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,834
We do things a little different
here in Virginia.

160
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,101
The condemned get a choice:

161
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,734
lethal injection
or death by electrocution.

162
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,434
Boone is the first one
to choose the chair.

163
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,434
Deserves worse.

164
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,900
Special Agent Gibbs?

165
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:40,934
I'm Adam O'Neill,
Kyle Boone's attorney.

166
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,401
I really appreciate
your coming.

167
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:47,533
I, uh... I understand
your reluctance here.

168
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,334
But I truly believe that my
client's intentions are sincere.

169
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:52,967
The day I arrested
your client,

170
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:55,834
we found two human female
tongues in his refrigerator.

171
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,401
I'm familiar with
the case, Agent Gibbs.

172
00:06:57,468 --> 00:06:59,434
Really? You familiar
with the names of his victims?

173
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,101
Look, I'm not here
to talk about the past.

174
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:03,101
I'm here trying
to save a man's life.

175
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,600
Boone wants a deal?

176
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:08,034
No. Mr. Boone
wants the chair
for his crimes.

177
00:07:08,101 --> 00:07:10,633
I'm the one hoping to
get him life in prison.

178
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,001
Good luck with that.

179
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,001
Agent Gibbs, please.

180
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:19,567
I'm just trying
to do my job here.

181
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:22,234
Maybe together, we can both
help the victims' families

182
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:24,234
find some closure.

183
00:07:24,301 --> 00:07:25,567
Be there Saturday.

184
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:27,834
You'll be able to
see them get that.

185
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,834
Right this way, gentlemen.

186
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,034
Well, actually,
against my advice,

187
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:36,633
Mr. Boone has elected to meet
with Agent Gibbs alone.

188
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,368
There'll be a guard out here
if you need him.

189
00:07:39,434 --> 00:07:41,034
I won't.

190
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:51,267
Nice to see you
again, Jethro.

191
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:55,500
I wasn't sure if you'd come,
but... here you are.

192
00:07:58,201 --> 00:08:00,201
You've got two minutes.
Start talking.

193
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:04,967
You know, you look
almost the same...

194
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:07,134
except the hair.

195
00:08:07,201 --> 00:08:09,001
When did it go gray?

196
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:10,667
Where are the bodies?

197
00:08:10,734 --> 00:08:12,600
We'll get to that.

198
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:15,533
There's just a few things
I need to ask you first.

199
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,234
I guess they showed you
my souvenirs?

200
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:21,301
There weren't 20
in that jar.

201
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:22,567
Your point?

202
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:25,167
I always thought you were
padding your account.

203
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:27,434
Oh. Baiting me?

204
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,967
Denigrating my rep?

205
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:31,900
Come on. You know that approach
never worked on me, Jethro.

206
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:33,767
A minute 38.

207
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:35,600
Can't we just chat for a bit?

208
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,201
Catch up?

209
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,468
Hmm?

210
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,800
How's the wife?

211
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:45,734
She left you, didn't she?

212
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,567
I tried to warn you
about that.

213
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:50,434
Women can't understand men
like us.

214
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,900
You got what, Boone?

215
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,234
Three days left?

216
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:55,301
How's it feel?

217
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,067
I'm kind of terrified.

218
00:08:58,134 --> 00:09:02,101
Weird, considering
my former activities.

219
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,934
They say it can take up to four
minutes to die in the chair.

220
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:07,667
Me, personally?

221
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:10,134
I'm hoping it
takes a lot longer.

222
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:12,500
You really have changed.

223
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:15,800
The old Gibbs would
never be this abrupt.

224
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:17,767
Did you remarry?

225
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:20,434
You got less than a minute.

226
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,067
Okay, okay, too personal.

227
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:25,468
Now, what about, uh, NCIS
Special Agent Caitlin Todd?

228
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:26,800
Can we talk about her?

229
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:29,667
I saw her picture in the <i>Post.</i>

230
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:33,434
They said she was shot
by a terrorist?

231
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,167
Did you cut back on the
caffeine like I told you?

232
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:39,500
See you Saturday.

233
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:40,867
Come on, Gibbs.

234
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:43,034
I was just having
some fun with you!

235
00:09:43,101 --> 00:09:44,301
You can't leave.

236
00:09:44,368 --> 00:09:46,101
You're here because
you're following orders,

237
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:47,468
like a good Marine.

238
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:49,301
Right, Gunny?

239
00:09:49,368 --> 00:09:51,167
I'll tell you where they are.

240
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:52,334
Where they all are.

241
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:54,800
There's more
than 22, Jethro.

242
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:07,434
Where is he, Timothy?

243
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:08,601
Uh, who?

244
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:10,134
Gibbs, damn it.

245
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,733
Hey!

246
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,501
Do you even know
the difference between

247
00:10:17,568 --> 00:10:19,800
good and bad
cholesterol, Tony?

248
00:10:19,867 --> 00:10:23,234
No, but I'm assuming it has
something to do with taste.

249
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:25,967
Bad is what came back
on your last blood test.

250
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:27,467
Dispose of this.

251
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:30,034
Hey, hey, that cost me
16 bucks, that pizza.

252
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,967
You'll thank me
when you're my age.

253
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:33,833
But you eat pizza
all the time.

254
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,100
Exactly.

255
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,067
I don't really see
the connection here.

256
00:10:37,134 --> 00:10:39,434
Well, of course you wouldn't,
you're not a doctor.

257
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:42,201
Where is Gibbs?

258
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,634
Sussex State Prison,
interviewing Kyle Boone.

259
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,167
He said he wasn't going.

260
00:10:46,234 --> 00:10:47,601
He wasn't.

261
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:49,467
Until the SecNav ordered him to.

262
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:50,467
Who's with him?

263
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:51,767
No one.

264
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,334
Have you any idea

265
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:56,267
the effect that psychopath had
on Gibbs ten years ago?

266
00:10:56,334 --> 00:10:58,034
Considering how open Gibbs is
about his personal life...

267
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,367
uh, no, not a clue.

268
00:11:00,434 --> 00:11:03,267
He should not have gone alone.

269
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:05,334
Ducky, it's... it's Gibbs.
I'm sure he'll be fine.

270
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:07,634
That's easy for you to say.
You didn't have

271
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,767
to live through this
the last time.

272
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,434
DiNozzo.

273
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:14,501
Where?

274
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,634
Yeah, I got it, boss.

275
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,167
We're on our way.
Cassidy, saddle up.

276
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:20,334
Gibbs wants you
in the field.

277
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:21,367
Boone family farm.

278
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:23,000
Wants me?

279
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:24,067
That's what he said.
Let's roll.

280
00:11:24,134 --> 00:11:26,201
The difference between

281
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:27,301
ten years ago and today, Ducky?

282
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:30,467
We have Gibbs' back.

283
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:31,800
There's another
difference, Tony.

284
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:35,167
Ten years ago,
Gibbs was a very different man.

285
00:11:35,234 --> 00:11:37,167
You mean he was
actually meaner?

286
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:38,867
No, quite the opposite.

287
00:11:38,934 --> 00:11:41,367
He was...

288
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,201
he was a lot like you.

289
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,601
TONY:
What do we got?

290
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,833
I can save you
the time, Gibbs.

291
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,401
My measurements
are 34...

292
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:04,301
26-34.

293
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:06,501
120 pounds. I'm right,

294
00:12:06,568 --> 00:12:07,733
aren't I?

295
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,367
Did you weigh and
measure me in my sleep?

296
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:11,867
I'm a crime-scene sketch expert.

297
00:12:11,934 --> 00:12:13,668
It's what I do.

298
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,700
You'll do.

299
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:15,967
Gibbs, again, you have

300
00:12:16,034 --> 00:12:17,967
such a way of making
a gal feel so special.

301
00:12:18,034 --> 00:12:19,100
Put this on.

302
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:20,167
McGee?

303
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:21,301
Yeah, boss?

304
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:22,833
You might want
to wear kneepads.

305
00:12:27,534 --> 00:12:28,900
Do we even have
kneepads?

306
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:30,201
Equipment inventory's
Kate's job.

307
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:31,800
You might want to ask...

308
00:12:39,601 --> 00:12:41,634
Do you know what
the hell we're doing?

309
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,201
Following Gibbs' lead.

310
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:44,234
On what?

311
00:12:44,301 --> 00:12:45,301
I don't know.

312
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:46,700
You don't know
and that doesn't

313
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:47,767
bother you at all?

314
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,201
You get used to it.

315
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:52,067
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

316
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,967
This place must have been gone
over a dozen times, boss.

317
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:00,401
No way there's any bodies
in here.

318
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:02,267
Not looking
for bodies, Tony.

319
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:04,467
Boone was raised here
by his uncle.

320
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:05,934
His mother was a prostitute,

321
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,601
she left town
when he was 12.

322
00:13:07,668 --> 00:13:10,267
Then what are we looking for?

323
00:13:10,334 --> 00:13:12,000
Proof.
Boone swears it's here,

324
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:15,900
and the only place we didn't
look is inside this chimney.

325
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:17,534
I think I got something.

326
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:18,634
( <i>coughs</i> ):
No.

327
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,267
That's just another
dead bird.

328
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,800
Oh, it's disgusting.

329
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:25,601
Bet this wasn't in the brochure

330
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:27,900
when you signed up
for NCIS, Probie.

331
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:29,000
McGEE:
You know, you were
wrong earlier.

332
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:30,100
About what?

333
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:32,067
She weighs more than
a buck 20.

334
00:13:32,134 --> 00:13:33,534
Oh.
Ow!

335
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:34,568
Sorry.

336
00:13:34,634 --> 00:13:36,267
She did that on purpose.

337
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:37,534
Okay.

338
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:39,067
Oh, no, I got...
it's right here by the flue.

339
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:40,100
I got it.

340
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:41,167
Okay, I'm coming down.

341
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:42,668
McGEE ( <i>sighs</i> ):
Finally.

342
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,100
You know, you could have
taken your...

343
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:46,201
( <i>groans</i> )
Jeez.
My bad.

344
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,700
Looks like a book.

345
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,467
Oh, there must be
30 pages there.

346
00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:16,733
More.

347
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:20,934
What's carved into their backs?

348
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,301
It's his
calling card, McGee.

349
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,034
Something wrong?
This section

350
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,967
on my mother, John,
is better, but it
still needs work.

351
00:14:33,034 --> 00:14:35,634
I was trying
to humanize her, Kyle.

352
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,568
Don't.

353
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:41,833
You find it
all right, Jethro?

354
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,301
I guess you wouldn't
be here if you didn't.

355
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:46,134
I don't believe
you've met my biographer,

356
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:48,234
John Briggs.

357
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:50,467
Special Agent Gibbs,
it is a pleasure.

358
00:14:50,534 --> 00:14:52,800
I've been trying to
schedule an interview
with you for months.

359
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:54,467
WARDEN:
You're going to have
to leave now, Briggs.

360
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:55,733
I've been granted
special permission

361
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,501
by the state of Virginia
to be here, Warden.

362
00:14:57,568 --> 00:14:58,534
Not anymore.

363
00:14:58,601 --> 00:15:00,201
Next time
you see Boone,

364
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,334
he'll have a thunderbolt
shooting out of his ass.

365
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,733
Hey, I was...
I was guaranteed

366
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,334
full access for the next
three days.

367
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:08,000
The warden
asked you to leave.

368
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:09,934
Don't make him ask you again.

369
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,034
You'll have to excuse
Agent Gibbs, John.

370
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,267
He's finally gotten a glimpse

371
00:15:13,334 --> 00:15:15,367
into the world
I've been telling him about.

372
00:15:15,434 --> 00:15:17,334
Scrapbook?

373
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:18,700
You found his scrapbook?

374
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:20,601
When... when will
it be released?

375
00:15:20,668 --> 00:15:23,234
Son, if you want to walk out
of here under your own power,

376
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:24,967
I suggest you leave now.

377
00:15:32,434 --> 00:15:35,534
John really is
a wonderful writer.

378
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,501
You know, he's spent years
trying to understand me.

379
00:15:38,568 --> 00:15:41,867
Unfortunately, he just never
seemed to measure up.

380
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:43,100
To who?

381
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,201
Your prostitute mom?

382
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:46,767
Or your father?

383
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:47,967
Some hick john

384
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,767
with a few extra bucks
in his pocket.

385
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,534
Actually, I was referring
to you, Jethro.

386
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:54,534
Show's over.

387
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:56,100
Where's the dumping ground?

388
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:57,967
You show me my scrapbook
one last time

389
00:15:58,034 --> 00:16:00,668
and I'll draw you a map
even a Marine can follow.

390
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:01,733
No.

391
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
They've suffered enough.

392
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:06,234
Well, we're at an impasse.

393
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:08,367
You're going to keep playing
this game with me, Boone?

394
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,568
I've never considered
any of this a game, Jethro.

395
00:16:13,634 --> 00:16:14,733
You know that.

396
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
Whatever.

397
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:16,900
I'm changing
the rules.

398
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:18,733
How so?

399
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,000
I've seen your world.

400
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:21,334
Now you're going to spend

401
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:23,634
what's left of your miserable
life in mine.

402
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:36,434
All right, listen up, my little
probationary field agents.

403
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:38,334
You're about to witness
the transfer

404
00:16:38,401 --> 00:16:40,967
of a maximum security prisoner
to our humble facility.

405
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,501
While he's here,
he's our sole responsibility.

406
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:47,067
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I boring you?

407
00:16:47,134 --> 00:16:48,301
My God,
does he ever stop?

408
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:49,867
I'm just glad it's not me.

409
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,334
It's 10:00.

410
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:54,668
Doesn't make any sense
bringing Boone here now.

411
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:57,201
Gibbs is trying to put him
on unfamiliar ground,

412
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,301
throw him off balance.

413
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,534
Because that worked
so well

414
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,534
ten years ago?

415
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:02,201
What's different now?

416
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:04,167
I am, Cassidy.
TONY:
Stand tall.

417
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:06,900
Lace up, Probies.

418
00:17:23,034 --> 00:17:24,668
I knew I could
count on you, Jethro.

419
00:17:29,034 --> 00:17:31,034
It's good to be
home again.

420
00:17:33,934 --> 00:17:36,334
( <i>sighs</i> ):
Yeah.

421
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:37,767
Good to be home.

422
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:44,800
TONY:
Guy's been impersonating
a statue all night.

423
00:17:44,867 --> 00:17:47,568
According to the watch,
he hasn't moved a muscle.

424
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,967
( <i>groans</i> ):
It's creepy.

425
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:52,467
When is Gibbs going to start
his interrogation?

426
00:17:52,534 --> 00:17:54,634
When he's ready.

427
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:56,568
Well, you might want
to tell him to hurry.

428
00:17:56,634 --> 00:17:57,800
He's got less than 48 hours

429
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:00,334
before Boone's
scheduled to be executed.

430
00:18:00,401 --> 00:18:03,601
I've got
a better idea, Paula.

431
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:04,934
Why don't you
tell him?

432
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,601
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
'Cause I'm not stupid.

433
00:18:07,668 --> 00:18:09,067
No.

434
00:18:09,134 --> 00:18:11,501
Of all the things you are,

435
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:13,867
stupid definitely
isn't one of them.

436
00:18:15,568 --> 00:18:16,601
Thank you.

437
00:18:16,668 --> 00:18:19,767
Okay, what's that supposed
to mean?

438
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:20,767
Nothing.

439
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,334
By the way, how's Bobert?

440
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,100
Why, are you jealous?

441
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:27,568
Of a lawyer?
Give me a break.

442
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:29,700
He's very rich.

443
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:30,867
Money isn't everything.

444
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:32,733
He's got season tickets
to the Redskins--

445
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
private sky box.

446
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:36,733
I'm happy for him.
And I almost forgot...

447
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,000
he drives a Ferrari.

448
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,967
Red.

449
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:47,000
Like Magnum.

450
00:18:47,067 --> 00:18:49,134
Well, that's nice.

451
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:51,467
Isn't it?

452
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:54,134
You know what's
even nicer?

453
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:56,067
My current view.

454
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:59,234
Victoria's Secret.
Agent Cassidy.

455
00:18:59,301 --> 00:19:01,733
Well, you enjoy it as long
as you can, Agent DiNozzo.

456
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,167
Because that's as close
as you're going to get.

457
00:19:05,867 --> 00:19:08,568
Cassidy?

458
00:19:08,634 --> 00:19:10,767
Check Boone's
security detail.

459
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,000
You got it.

460
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:13,967
I'll give her a hand with that.

461
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:15,034
Wait.

462
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,067
What was that for?

463
00:19:24,134 --> 00:19:25,234
Letting her get to you.

464
00:19:25,301 --> 00:19:26,733
Boss, I was not
letting her get...

465
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,867
Won't let it
happen again.

466
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:33,301
Thanks.

467
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,467
It's for Abby.

468
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:37,833
Go find out
how many victims she ID'd

469
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,167
from Boone's scrapbook.

470
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,367
There were 27 women
in the scrapbook, McGee.

471
00:20:07,434 --> 00:20:08,668
And as far as I can tell,

472
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:09,833
they're in the order
that they were killed.

473
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,134
Now, Boone has admitted
to killing 22,

474
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:14,434
which matches
with the photos
and the files

475
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:15,767
that the FBI
sent over.

476
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:16,900
Uh-huh.

477
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,134
Which would make you think

478
00:20:18,201 --> 00:20:19,601
that we'd be left
with five Jane Does,

479
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:20,767
but you'd be wrong

480
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:25,234
'cause I know
who the first victim is.

481
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:27,700
You're not listening
to a word I'm saying.

482
00:20:28,634 --> 00:20:30,700
I'm pregnant, McGee.

483
00:20:30,767 --> 00:20:32,434
Twins.

484
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:34,601
Haven't told
the father yet.

485
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:36,100
It's Gibbs.

486
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:38,867
I know it's wrong,
but something about

487
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:41,167
his silver hair just gets me
all tingly inside.

488
00:20:41,234 --> 00:20:43,067
TONY:
Excuse me for a sec.
I think

489
00:20:43,134 --> 00:20:44,067
I'm going to vomit.

490
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:45,367
I'm joking, Tony.

491
00:20:45,434 --> 00:20:47,201
Except for the part
about Gibbs' hair.

492
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:49,668
That is really hot.

493
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:51,167
McGee's ignoring me again.

494
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:52,301
Easily fixable.

495
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:54,034
What? What'd I do?

496
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,733
Stop ignoring Abby.
She's sensitive.

497
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,100
I'm sorry.
I was concentrating.

498
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:58,634
I think that I know
how we can

499
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,100
find Boone's victims without
Gibbs having to talk to him.

500
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:04,301
There are distinctive
geographical and
man-made features

501
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:06,134
in several
of these pictures.

502
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:09,034
There's a stream...
and what may be a bridge...

503
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,267
Up here, there appears
to be a power line.

504
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:15,401
Or some dirt
on a picture.

505
00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:16,800
If I can make
a land plot, create scale

506
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:18,467
by computing the distances
between these points,

507
00:21:18,534 --> 00:21:19,534
then we can...

508
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:21,900
Okay.
Streams and power lines?

509
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,668
It would take years searching
just one county, McGee,

510
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:24,867
never mind a state.

511
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:27,067
Yeah, for us, Tony,
but not for a computer.

512
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:29,067
Satellite imagery?
Exactly.

513
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:30,601
I should have thought of that.

514
00:21:30,668 --> 00:21:32,767
I just need to figure out a way
to calculate an accurate scale.

515
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,634
ABBY:
Polaroid cameras have
a fixed focal length.

516
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,833
McGEE:
It's a good start.

517
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,900
Uh, I'm going to need
one known measurement.

518
00:21:37,967 --> 00:21:40,000
Pick one body
and I'll pull her stats.

519
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:41,134
Three known vectors
should do it.

520
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:42,201
Four would be...
Okay, okay.

521
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:43,568
Enough with
the geek-speak.

522
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:44,833
Gibbs wants to know
how many victims we ID'd.

523
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,568
All, except for the last four
in the scrapbook.

524
00:21:48,634 --> 00:21:49,967
We're running them against
missing persons reports

525
00:21:50,034 --> 00:21:51,501
prior to Gibbs putting
Boone behind bars.

526
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:53,134
No matches yet.

527
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:54,568
The one that stands
out the most

528
00:21:54,634 --> 00:21:56,867
is the first victim.

529
00:21:56,934 --> 00:21:59,634
She disappeared in 1974.

530
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,601
Are you sure about that, Abs?

531
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:03,568
Boone was just
a kid back then.

532
00:22:03,634 --> 00:22:04,967
I know.

533
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:07,634
And it turns out his mother
did not abandon him.

534
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,867
She was his first kill.

535
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,534
You don't have to do
this again, you know.

536
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:25,434
You're wrong, Duck, I do.

537
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:27,767
He's never going
to tell you

538
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:28,900
where those poor girls are.

539
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:29,967
I know that.

540
00:22:30,034 --> 00:22:32,434
Then why?

541
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,501
Because ten years ago,
I couldn't break him.

542
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:38,800
No, but you did
what no one else could;

543
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:40,668
you caught the son of a bitch.

544
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:42,201
I should have killed him.

545
00:22:42,267 --> 00:22:45,467
And in two days,
that will be rectified.

546
00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:49,367
I'm telling you
as a friend,

547
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,467
it's time
to let this one go.

548
00:22:51,534 --> 00:22:52,934
Not yet, Ducky.

549
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,034
You already lost one

550
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,301
relationship as a result
of this case.

551
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:58,767
I mean, she was a wonderful
girl, and you neglected...

552
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:00,134
She left me, Duck!

553
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:02,534
I didn't leave her!

554
00:23:02,601 --> 00:23:04,100
No, you made it impossible

555
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:05,700
for her to stay.

556
00:23:10,534 --> 00:23:11,900
Okay, send him up.

557
00:23:11,967 --> 00:23:13,067
Make sure he's escorted.

558
00:23:13,134 --> 00:23:14,267
I'll let Gibbs know.

559
00:23:16,668 --> 00:23:17,700
Comfortable?

560
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:20,201
Yeah.
Matter of fact, I...

561
00:23:20,267 --> 00:23:21,767
It was a rhetorical question,
lady.

562
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,800
Wow. I never realized
how sensitive you were

563
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:25,367
about your desk.

564
00:23:25,434 --> 00:23:27,034
There's a lot
about me you don't
realize, Cassidy.

565
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,100
Where's Gibbs?

566
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:30,334
Interrogation.

567
00:23:30,401 --> 00:23:31,900
Well, Boone's lawyer
is here.

568
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:33,467
He claims he wasn't notified
about his client's being moved

569
00:23:33,534 --> 00:23:34,833
and he wants to talk to him.

570
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,467
Ooh, Gibbs doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

571
00:23:37,534 --> 00:23:40,767
You better go right in there
and tell him yourself.

572
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,134
I'll get the suit.

573
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:49,201
Finally.

574
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:51,534
So where should we start
this time, Jethro?

575
00:23:51,601 --> 00:23:53,634
My childhood?

576
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,568
I didn't bring you in here
to talk, Boone.

577
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:59,401
So, you decided
to let me see my
photographs again?

578
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:00,967
I told you, that's not going
to happen.

579
00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:02,634
Interesting.

580
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,934
May I ask why I'm here then?

581
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
The State is hoping
that I'll get

582
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:07,833
the location
of your victims.

583
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,267
I believe that requires
some form of communication.

584
00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:13,967
I said, "the state." Me?

585
00:24:14,034 --> 00:24:16,167
Not even going to try.

586
00:24:16,234 --> 00:24:17,467
But you always try, Jethro.

587
00:24:17,534 --> 00:24:19,100
That's why I like you.

588
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:21,668
I've taken you out
of the system, Boone.

589
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:23,067
You're going
to sit here alone,

590
00:24:23,134 --> 00:24:24,167
without any human contact

591
00:24:24,234 --> 00:24:25,900
until you fry.

592
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:29,401
The game ends now.

593
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,401
This room brings back

594
00:24:30,467 --> 00:24:33,167
so many memories.

595
00:24:33,234 --> 00:24:34,501
Doesn't it?

596
00:24:36,301 --> 00:24:38,167
CASSIDY:
Special Agent Gibbs?
A word, please.

597
00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:40,867
Sounds like you replaced
your dead female.

598
00:24:40,934 --> 00:24:43,668
Any chance I can
meet this one?

599
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,534
Hmm?

600
00:24:49,534 --> 00:24:52,334
Well, I'll be here
if you need me.

601
00:24:55,568 --> 00:24:56,568
What?!

602
00:24:56,634 --> 00:24:58,000
Boone's attorney's here.

603
00:24:58,067 --> 00:24:59,800
The D.A.'s afraid if we deny him
access to his client,

604
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:01,000
then he'll find
a sympathetic judge

605
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:01,934
and have cause to have
the execution delayed.

606
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,534
I got it.

607
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:07,668
Look, I need a privileged
conversation with my client.

608
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:08,867
Meaning, Agent Gibbs,

609
00:25:08,934 --> 00:25:10,434
I want your observation
room cleared

610
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:13,000
and all microphones
turned off.

611
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:15,201
That's it, counselor?

612
00:25:15,267 --> 00:25:16,867
For now, Agent.

613
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:18,568
Tony?

614
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:20,833
Yeah, hold on a second.

615
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,733
Search him first...

616
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,833
thoroughly.

617
00:25:30,934 --> 00:25:34,234
Huh.
I'm impressed.

618
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:35,967
It's actually working.

619
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,167
Thank you.

620
00:25:37,234 --> 00:25:39,234
Now all we have
to do is scan through

621
00:25:39,301 --> 00:25:42,934
800,000 miles of satellite
imagery and pray we get lucky.

622
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,067
I am a scientist, McGee.

623
00:25:46,134 --> 00:25:48,501
Luck has nothing
to do with it and/or us.

624
00:25:48,568 --> 00:25:52,534
Okay, then how do you explain
something like Gibbs's gut?

625
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:53,934
Well, that's easy.

626
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,900
Gibbs is lucky.

627
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:57,234
But you just said that...

628
00:25:57,301 --> 00:25:59,000
He's not a scientist.

629
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,867
Agent Gibbs, if anything
happens to my client

630
00:26:04,934 --> 00:26:07,034
while he's here,
I want you to know

631
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,668
I am going to hold you
personally responsible...

632
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:11,434
You have my word he will
be in perfect health

633
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:12,501
for his execution.

634
00:26:12,568 --> 00:26:14,733
Escort Mr. O'Neill out

635
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,434
of my building,
Special Agent Cassidy.

636
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:18,534
You'll be hearing
from me.

637
00:26:18,601 --> 00:26:21,000
Let's go.

638
00:26:21,067 --> 00:26:22,534
You going back
in there, Boss?

639
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:24,733
Yeah, maybe.

640
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,401
Gibbs.

641
00:26:26,467 --> 00:26:29,634
Gibbs, it's Abby. McGee and I
think we might have found

642
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,833
Boone's dumping ground.

643
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,867
We've got it on the screen
in my lab.

644
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:35,301
They think they may have found
his dumping ground.

645
00:26:38,201 --> 00:26:39,401
What am I looking at?

646
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:41,601
Take it, Mc-Key.

647
00:26:45,934 --> 00:26:48,967
I mean, um,
very Special Agent McGee.

648
00:26:49,034 --> 00:26:52,234
Probable site where the victims
were tortured, killed

649
00:26:52,301 --> 00:26:54,234
and perhaps buried.

650
00:26:54,301 --> 00:26:55,934
You want to know
how we did it?
Not really.

651
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Good, 'cause it
was mostly luck.

652
00:26:58,067 --> 00:26:59,301
Where?

653
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,501
Wilderness area,
Great Falls National Park.

654
00:27:00,568 --> 00:27:01,934
Tony, you lead the team.
Right.

655
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,334
Where you going, Boss?

656
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:05,167
After ten years, I finally
got something on Boone

657
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:07,000
he doesn't already
know about.

658
00:27:07,067 --> 00:27:09,800
My lawyer was very upset.

659
00:27:09,867 --> 00:27:11,733
He wanted to move me
back to prison.

660
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,167
But don't worry.

661
00:27:13,234 --> 00:27:14,601
I told him I like it here.

662
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:15,601
Don't get too comfortable.

663
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:18,134
You're going back today.

664
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:20,434
Really?
What's changed?

665
00:27:20,501 --> 00:27:24,767
You found something, didn't you?

666
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:34,934
McGEE:
The site where the photos
were taken

667
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,100
is 265 feet on a track
of 310 degrees.

668
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:41,833
We need to get through here.

669
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:45,134
Okay.

670
00:27:45,201 --> 00:27:46,201
Remember what
I taught you

671
00:27:46,267 --> 00:27:47,000
about the poison ivy,
all right?

672
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:49,434
Don't tell Cassidy.

673
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,601
What?

674
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:51,668
Nothing.

675
00:27:51,733 --> 00:27:53,467
Follow me.

676
00:28:00,234 --> 00:28:01,967
I'm okay. I'm okay.

677
00:28:02,034 --> 00:28:06,267
This is steep.
Watch yourselves.

678
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:17,334
Well, if this is the place,
I can see why Boone picked it.

679
00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:19,401
Off the beaten path,

680
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:21,367
no hard surfaces
to reflect sound.

681
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:24,167
Those girls could scream their
heads off and no one would hear.

682
00:28:24,234 --> 00:28:26,067
Yeah, this is the perfect spot.

683
00:29:07,234 --> 00:29:08,601
Guys,

684
00:29:08,668 --> 00:29:10,301
we're in
the right place.

685
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:17,201
No reception.

686
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:19,401
Spread out,
tape it off.

687
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:21,000
We'll hike back
and call Gibbs.

688
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:30,167
Come on, Jethro,
we both know you're in there.

689
00:29:34,934 --> 00:29:35,867
Hey.

690
00:29:35,934 --> 00:29:37,833
Hey.

691
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,201
What are you
doing here?

692
00:29:39,267 --> 00:29:41,467
I wanted to see
what the monster looks like.

693
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:49,634
ABBY:
He doesn't look that scary.

694
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:51,934
You saw the photographs?

695
00:29:53,568 --> 00:29:55,867
Yeah.

696
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,201
TONY:
You did good, McGee.

697
00:30:05,267 --> 00:30:06,401
I'm proud of you.

698
00:30:06,467 --> 00:30:08,267
And?

699
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:10,000
And what?

700
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:13,034
Well, usually you add some kind
of insult at the end.

701
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,434
No, I don't.

702
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:17,501
Well, okay,
maybe sometimes.

703
00:30:17,568 --> 00:30:19,434
But the point
is we're a team and...

704
00:30:19,501 --> 00:30:21,201
CASSIDY:
Whoa! Tony?

705
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,167
You all right?

706
00:30:27,234 --> 00:30:30,534
I was, uh, a little startled.

707
00:30:30,601 --> 00:30:32,000
By what?

708
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:33,733
Her.

709
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:46,167
She couldn't have been dead
more than a few days.

710
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:52,234
Tony, you're not going
to believe it.

711
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:54,867
?????

712
00:31:02,034 --> 00:31:03,201
I-I...

713
00:31:03,268 --> 00:31:05,234
I can't get any reception
out here.

714
00:31:05,301 --> 00:31:08,500
That's not surprising.

715
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,334
"Butt nowhere" isn't part
of our coverage plan.

716
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,101
CASSIDY:
I'm gonna head back
to the truck

717
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:14,101
and try and get
the call through.

718
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:15,800
Okay. Tell Gibbs
we're gonna need everything

719
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:17,034
and everyone on this one.

720
00:31:17,101 --> 00:31:18,567
I'll be back
in 20 minutes.

721
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:33,967
Yeah. Gibbs.

722
00:31:34,034 --> 00:31:36,034
Gibbs...

723
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:37,234
we found Boone's dumping ground.

724
00:31:37,301 --> 00:31:38,234
Good work.

725
00:31:38,301 --> 00:31:39,734
Tell Tony he needs to call...

726
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,400
We also found a fresh body.

727
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:43,201
Female. Dead less than a week.

728
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,700
She has Boone's mark
on her back.

729
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:47,167
I think we're definitely dealing

730
00:31:47,234 --> 00:31:48,901
( <i>static</i> )
with a copycat killer.

731
00:31:48,967 --> 00:31:51,134
Gibbs?

732
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,600
Gibbs, can you hear me?
Yeah, I heard you.

733
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:54,967
I want the area sealed off.

734
00:31:55,034 --> 00:31:56,067
I'm on my way.

735
00:32:04,067 --> 00:32:06,067
Tony.

736
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:08,667
( <i>flies buzzing</i> )
Something's not right.

737
00:32:08,734 --> 00:32:11,667
Well, nothing has
been since Boone
showed up at NCIS.

738
00:32:11,734 --> 00:32:14,034
No, no. I-I know this girl.

739
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:16,234
You know her? How?

740
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:17,834
You know her, too.

741
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:19,967
She was the last entry
in Boone's scrapbook--

742
00:32:20,034 --> 00:32:21,734
one of the Jane Does.

743
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,600
He's been
on death row

744
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:25,533
for ten years, McGee.

745
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,901
She's been here
less than a week.

746
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:30,567
It's not possible.

747
00:32:37,101 --> 00:32:38,634
It can't be.

748
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:48,301
You look a little
peaked, Jethro.

749
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:50,167
Something wrong?

750
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,433
Maybe I can help.

751
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,034
A new development,
perhaps?

752
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:57,700
I got to hand it
to you, Boone.

753
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,234
I did my best.

754
00:33:00,301 --> 00:33:02,967
But you got me to play
your game-- congratulations.

755
00:33:03,034 --> 00:33:05,934
You found the bodies. Good.

756
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:07,901
Not what you were expecting,

757
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:09,167
was it?

758
00:33:09,234 --> 00:33:11,600
You see, there's someone
else out there now--

759
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:13,234
a new threat--

760
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:16,201
and I'm the only one who
can help you find him.

761
00:33:16,268 --> 00:33:19,334
You'll have to request
a stay of my execution.

762
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:24,268
Gonna have to pass
on that. Mm-mm.

763
00:33:24,334 --> 00:33:25,967
No matter how this
plays out,

764
00:33:26,034 --> 00:33:27,667
you're gonna sit
in that chair Saturday.

765
00:33:27,734 --> 00:33:29,101
You can't have
changed this much.

766
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:30,268
You have a sworn duty.

767
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:32,567
Maybe ten years ago.

768
00:33:32,634 --> 00:33:33,834
Now...

769
00:33:33,901 --> 00:33:35,234
hell...

770
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:37,734
I can wait till Sunday
to start an investigation.

771
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
You're bluffing.
You're dead

772
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:40,934
in 36 hours.

773
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:42,334
Yeah, well,
I'll be here

774
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,334
when you change your mind.

775
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:03,067
Cassidy!

776
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:06,001
Cassidy!

777
00:34:06,067 --> 00:34:08,533
Great! She's lost.

778
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,201
Why didn't you give her

779
00:34:10,268 --> 00:34:11,800
your GPS thingie,
Probie?

780
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:14,034
She's not lost.

781
00:34:14,101 --> 00:34:15,800
What's going on?!

782
00:34:18,234 --> 00:34:20,201
She's been kidnapped.

783
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:23,634
McGee, where is my list
of every visitor and phone call

784
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,400
Boone's had
since being in prison?

785
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:26,634
Working it, boss.

786
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,767
Tony?

787
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,134
Tony!

788
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,167
Backup teams
in place?
Yeah.

789
00:34:32,234 --> 00:34:36,167
I never should've let her
take off like that alone, Boss.

790
00:34:36,234 --> 00:34:38,700
The Polaroid of Cassidy's clean;
there's no prints, no DNA.

791
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:41,334
I'm sorry, Gibbs,
I screwed this whole thing up.

792
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,167
<i>You</i> screwed it up?
We should've known
there was more

793
00:34:43,234 --> 00:34:44,867
than one killer--
I only ran the Jane Does

794
00:34:44,934 --> 00:34:46,734
up until the time
Boone was captured.

795
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,001
All four have gone missing
in the last three years.

796
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:50,567
Concentrate on Boone's contacts

797
00:34:50,634 --> 00:34:52,667
over the past
three years.
Yeah.

798
00:34:53,867 --> 00:34:55,167
ABBY:
We can't lose another agent.

799
00:34:55,234 --> 00:34:56,734
I can't take this.

800
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,334
Okay, our best bet is a guy
named John Frederick Briggs.

801
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,334
In the last three years,
he's logged 229 phone calls

802
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,001
and visited
Boone 96 times.

803
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:05,500
He's writing
Boone's biography.

804
00:35:05,567 --> 00:35:07,433
He's living it.
He's off to a good start.

805
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,001
Dishonorable discharge
from the army in '91.

806
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,368
Arrested for domestic
disturbance in 2000

807
00:35:12,433 --> 00:35:15,201
for beating
his girlfriend.
Find him.

808
00:35:15,268 --> 00:35:16,734
Home address
and cell phone number.

809
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,101
Find out if his cell has
a GPS locator...
Checked the carrier.

810
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:21,001
It does,
and it can be remotely activated

811
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:22,067
by the company
if it's reported stolen.

812
00:35:22,134 --> 00:35:23,400
Good job, McGee.
Good job, McGee.

813
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:24,467
Let's roll.

814
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,800
Okay, Briggs' cell provider

815
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:39,533
is relaying us his location.

816
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,901
He's in movement.
He's headed

817
00:35:40,967 --> 00:35:42,667
out of DC on the 190 West.

818
00:35:48,967 --> 00:35:50,767
He's getting off
the 190 at Oakley.

819
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:52,101
If you get off
at MacArthur,

820
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:53,533
you might make it before him.

821
00:35:58,767 --> 00:35:59,834
How far ahead is he?

822
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:00,901
Less than a mile.

823
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:08,967
That's got to be him.

824
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:21,301
Keep your hands on the wheel!
Keep 'em up!

825
00:36:21,368 --> 00:36:23,600
BRIGGS:
Okay, what the hell's
going on here?

826
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:25,134
Where is she, Briggs?

827
00:36:25,201 --> 00:36:26,734
Okay.

828
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,901
Okay, I have every right
to be here.

829
00:36:28,967 --> 00:36:31,600
Heard from a guard
you found the bodies.

830
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:35,500
I want to see 'em.
Shut up.

831
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,700
Hello.

832
00:36:56,834 --> 00:36:58,800
What did you do to me?

833
00:36:58,867 --> 00:37:01,467
I hit you in the head

834
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:03,201
with a shovel,
my dear.

835
00:37:03,268 --> 00:37:04,700
Did you kill

836
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:05,800
that woman we found?

837
00:37:05,867 --> 00:37:06,867
( <i>whispers</i> ):
I did.

838
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:09,700
How many more

839
00:37:09,767 --> 00:37:11,201
are there, O'Neill?

840
00:37:11,268 --> 00:37:12,400
Let's see, there was...

841
00:37:12,467 --> 00:37:14,467
there was one,
and there was two,

842
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:15,734
three, four...

843
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,067
( <i>coughing</i> )
You will make five.

844
00:37:18,134 --> 00:37:20,800
( <i>camera shutter clicks</i> )

845
00:37:20,867 --> 00:37:24,334
How did Boone turn his lawyer
into his replacement?

846
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,634
Do you really think I'm Boone's
lawyer by coincidence?

847
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,334
Come on!

848
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,667
See, I...

849
00:37:29,734 --> 00:37:31,967
I sought Boone out.

850
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:35,800
Why?

851
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:37,533
So I could learn from him.

852
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,700
Learn from the best.

853
00:37:39,767 --> 00:37:41,301
And you...

854
00:37:41,368 --> 00:37:43,734
you're my graduation present.

855
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:52,567
You know, you can scream

856
00:37:52,634 --> 00:37:54,800
if you want to--
it's allowed.

857
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,600
Ho-ho!

858
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:02,567
Kyle says he wants Agent Gibbs
to remember him

859
00:38:02,634 --> 00:38:04,500
for a long, long time

860
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:05,834
after he's gone.

861
00:38:05,901 --> 00:38:07,167
So you and me...

862
00:38:09,268 --> 00:38:12,533
...we're gonna take this
nice and slow.

863
00:38:19,368 --> 00:38:21,533
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Aw...

864
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,901
a fighter, huh?

865
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,634
I haven't had one of those
before.

866
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,634
You want to try that thing
again with that knife?

867
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,934
You wanted to see
your scrapbook?

868
00:38:31,001 --> 00:38:33,934
Where is my agent?

869
00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:44,067
BOONE:
Stop, st...
( <i>flicking lighter</i> )

870
00:38:44,134 --> 00:38:45,400
Stop.

871
00:38:47,101 --> 00:38:48,934
Look, you don't know
what you're d...

872
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:50,800
You don't know what
you're doing.

873
00:38:53,034 --> 00:38:54,533
Jethro... don't...

874
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,101
Damn it.

875
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,967
I don't know
where she is.

876
00:38:58,034 --> 00:38:59,301
How can I?

877
00:39:01,734 --> 00:39:02,934
Please? Just
let me see them

878
00:39:03,001 --> 00:39:04,301
one last time, please?

879
00:39:04,368 --> 00:39:06,767
( <i>sobbing</i> ):
I'm-I'm begging you.

880
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:07,934
I'm begging you.

881
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:09,368
Where... is she?

882
00:39:15,234 --> 00:39:19,467
We all know you can't
destroy evidence.

883
00:39:19,533 --> 00:39:21,600
Pathetic, Jethro.

884
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:25,368
Do you really think that
I need <i>that</i> to see them,

885
00:39:25,433 --> 00:39:28,867
when they're all up here
anytime I want?

886
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:30,934
Your agent is
gonna suffer.

887
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,834
The obscenities
unleashed on her,

888
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:34,467
legendary-- you know why?

889
00:39:34,533 --> 00:39:38,600
Because you're the one
that stopped me...
This is all your fault!

890
00:39:40,934 --> 00:39:44,167
He's cutting her tongue
out of her mouth

891
00:39:44,234 --> 00:39:45,800
right now.

892
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:48,134
You know the best part?

893
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:51,134
After I'm gone...
bodies are just gonna

894
00:39:51,201 --> 00:39:52,767
continue to pile up.

895
00:39:54,567 --> 00:39:57,700
Shoot.
( <i>click</i> )

896
00:39:57,767 --> 00:40:01,334
Shoot me, you're supposed
to shoot me, you idiot.

897
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,001
That the big plan

898
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,967
you spent ten years
working on?

899
00:40:07,034 --> 00:40:11,800
Get me to murder <i>you</i>
and ruin my own life?

900
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,001
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Wow.

901
00:40:14,067 --> 00:40:16,834
He's carving your name
in her back right now.

902
00:40:16,901 --> 00:40:18,634
Game's over.

903
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,067
Back to death row.

904
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:22,301
Gibbs?

905
00:40:22,368 --> 00:40:24,334
Gibbs.

906
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,667
BOONE:
The governor call yet?

907
00:40:26,734 --> 00:40:28,700
'Cause they're not
gonna kill me now.

908
00:40:28,767 --> 00:40:30,700
I'm the only one
who can identify the killer.

909
00:40:30,767 --> 00:40:33,334
Hey, do you think
she screamed

910
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,400
when he cut out her tongue,
Jethro?

911
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:36,800
I don't know.

912
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:39,634
Why don't you ask her yourself?

913
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,001
I'm afraid your lawyer's
gonna miss

914
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:44,368
your execution tomorrow.

915
00:40:44,433 --> 00:40:47,167
He's kind of dead.

916
00:40:47,234 --> 00:40:49,134
GIBBS:
Enjoy hell.

917
00:40:50,433 --> 00:40:51,901
No!

918
00:40:51,967 --> 00:40:53,433
No...!

919
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,834
No!
