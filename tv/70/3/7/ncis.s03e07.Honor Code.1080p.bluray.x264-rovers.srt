1
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,700
Hey, Zach. Zachary.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,480
What did I say about wandering off?
You have to be careful of strangers.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,710
- Sorry.
- Here.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,550
Dad, balloons are for babies.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,160
Right. What about that
cotton candy? Is that still…?

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,090
Oh, no. That's fine. We could
share it after my ride.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,700
I'll try to save you some.
It looks awfully good to me.

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,300
Dad, after the ride.

9
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,430
I'll be watching you.

10
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,370
Dad.

11
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,550
Dad.

12
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,800
A whole hour for a lunch run, Probie?

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,100
Yeah, while Ziva and I were out,

14
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,680
she asked me to show her
the best routes to work.

15
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,080
Her driving has gotten a lot better.
Barely broke any laws this time.

16
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,810
Let me get this straight.

17
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,640
Ziva asked you,

18
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,810
who can barely navigate the Navy yard,
to show her the best way to work?

19
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,960
- That's right.
- Well, what about me?

20
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,290
I know every shortcut in the metro area.

21
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,620
I could shave 10 minutes
off her commute like that.

22
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,090
I don't know what to tell you.

23
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,400
It doesn't make any sense.

24
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,700
Unless,

25
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,480
maybe I intimidate her.

26
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,150
Yeah, I'm sure that's it.

27
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,540
I've seen it happen before.
It's a chemical thing.

28
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,050
- Hard to explain.
- I do hope you try.

29
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,690
I told you not to do that again.

30
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,050
Sorry, I was so intimidated by your
presence, I must have forgotten.

31
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:10,420
Seriously, I do apologize for not
asking your advice on my commute.

32
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,100
Don't worry about it.

33
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,670
If I would have known you would
have felt so emasculated…

34
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,270
- Is that the word? Emasculated.
- Yes, it is, emasculated.

35
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,840
I would have asked you first.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It takes a little more than an exotic accent

37
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,580
and some stealth ninja moves to emasculate me.

38
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,340
Only a little more? How disappointing.

39
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,550
Don't take sides, Probie.

40
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,210
Gear up. We have a missing person.
Coleman Park Carousel in Arlington.

41
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,720
- A child?
- Father.

42
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,950
Lieutenant Commander Alex Tanner.

43
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,730
Disappeared an hour ago.

44
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,020
Do you always respond to
missing persons cases so promptly?

45
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,730
Special circumstances, Ziva.
His 6-year-old son called NCIS.

46
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,460
He's in the park, alone, waiting
for us. DiNozzo, you drive.

47
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,110
I think McGee wants to drive, Boss.

48
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,540
You know what, Tony? I would
really rather have you drive.

49
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,410
Afraid to run over another fire hydrant?

50
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,570
I'm sure that wasn't your fault. It
was, according to the police report.

51
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,250
- I'll drive.
- One more word, you're all walking.

52
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,680
You got it, Boss.

53
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,060
I deserved that.

54
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,400
Zach.

55
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,840
Hey, I'm Special Agent DiNozzo,
you can call me Tony, okay?

56
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,340
That's a smart thing to do,
calling NCIS. Good boy.

57
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,010
I know this really scary, but I want
you to be brave. Can you do that?

58
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,150
Okay, I want you to think
back to what happened today.

59
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,450
Try to remember the details.

60
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,430
There's no wrong answer here.

61
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,720
- What do we know?
- Nothing. I think the kid's in shock.

62
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,460
No, I'm not.

63
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,670
I'm waiting for Agent DiNozzo
to ask me a question.

64
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,770
What kinds of questions was I supposed to ask?

65
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,970
What I saw. Why I called NCIS.

66
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,510
What did you see, Zach?

67
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,750
2 men were watching us. I
think they kidnapped my Dad.

68
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,550
Describe them.

69
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,950
Dark glasses. One had a military haircut.

70
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,390
One had a shaved head.

71
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,120
- How old?
- About your age.

72
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,800
They had iPods too.

73
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,300
It's like a Walkman, Boss, an iPod.

74
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,900
They were only listening in one ear like this.

75
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,880
Be back in a minute, Zach.

76
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,650
- Dark glasses, earwigs.
- Sounds like feds.

77
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,380
You think the FBI would arrest a man
and leave his kid in the park, DiNozzo?

78
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,180
Maybe our Commander took a walk.

79
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,420
My Father left me in the
Maui Hilton for 2 days.

80
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,390
He didn't realize I was missing
until he got the room service bill.

81
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,570
Sad, but enlightening.

82
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,990
Boss, I just spoke with the Commander's CO.

83
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,530
He's very concerned.

84
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,600
Apparently, Commander Tanner was working

85
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,830
on a highly classified DOD project.

86
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,410
What project, McGee?

87
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,740
I don't… he wouldn't say
over an unsecured line

88
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,210
but I'm going to find out.

89
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,850
Footage from the security cameras?

90
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,610
Park Security released them to me.

91
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,180
Okay, get ahold of Zach's Mom. And
then she can pick him up at NCIS.

92
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,410
Boss. Boss.

93
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,700
His Mother's dead. Killed 4
years ago in a car accident.

94
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,700
Primary next of kin?

95
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,630
There is none.

96
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,440
Just Commander Tanner and his son.

97
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,570
These guys are definitely pros.

98
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,370
They keep their faces from the camera.

99
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,050
All we've got to go on is
the kid's description of them.

100
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,280
You know, it doesn't look
like a kidnapping to me.

101
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,220
- They don't have guns.
- Barely touched the Commander.

102
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,820
They could have threatened his son.

103
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,120
Explains why they left him alone in the park.

104
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,220
What do we know about Commander Tanner?

105
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,990
Well, Boss, he is a brilliant man.

106
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,000
A dual PhD from Caltech
in Number and Chaos Theory.

107
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,730
I was reading his thesis online.

108
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,100
He manages to link
non-relativistic quantum effects…

109
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,410
Well, that's useful to this case, McGee.

110
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,270
Last 3 years he's been the Navy's liaison

111
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,240
with a defense contractor, Q & R Software.

112
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,270
Been the project lead on “Honor”.

113
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,080
- Which is?
- Classified.

114
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,290
I put a call to the head of security
over there. No one's gotten back to me.

115
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,680
So I thought I would pay them a visit?

116
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,990
Yeah, that's a good answer. Tony go with him.

117
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,690
The sketch artist is done
with Zach's descriptions.

118
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,760
The boy has a remarkable memory.

119
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,270
There's also someone here from
Social Security to pick him up.

120
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,910
Services, Ziva. Social
Security is for older people.

121
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,410
Noted.

122
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,170
- Do you want me to tell the boy?
- No, I'll handle it. Here, sit down.

123
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,550
Put out a BOLO on the composites.

124
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,810
Hey, Zach.

125
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,220
- Good job on the sketches, man.
- Thanks.

126
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,490
That's Social Services?

127
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,420
They'll take care of you
until we get your Dad back.

128
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,170
I can take care of myself.

129
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't doubt that.

130
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:22,440
- But I still have to go.
- Yeah, just for a while. Come on.

131
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:27,240
What if you… what if you don't
find my Dad, Agent Gibbs?

132
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,380
I'll find him, Zach. I'll find him.

133
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,020
Hey.

134
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,250
If you ever need me or even
if you just want to talk,

135
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,390
you call, okay?

136
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,500
I'm sorry we didn't get
back to you right away.

137
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,530
We’ve been having some problems of our own.

138
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,330
- What kind of problems?
- Honestly, I don't know.

139
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,030
I'm only Mr. Connell's
assistant. I'm sure he can…

140
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,970
That's been happening for
the last half-hour or so.

141
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,670
They should snap back on.

142
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,480
Are you all right, Ms. Osgood?

143
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,480
- It's Laura.
- Laura.

144
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,390
Ms. Osgood.

145
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,190
I'll take it from here.

146
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,500
- Frank Connell, Q & R security.
- You certainly got here fast.

147
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,360
We just found out about the
break-in ourselves an hour ago.

148
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,140
At 0300 this morning,
our network was breached.

149
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,140
We didn't detect the intrusion until we
attempted to boot up our main servers.

150
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,780
Since then, we've had our
hands full tracking the viruses

151
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,240
they embedded in our system.

152
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,420
Do we know yet what data's been compromised?

153
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,640
It's clear they were after
a working copy of “Honor”

154
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,150
but fortunately, it's protected by
a key that exists outside our system.

155
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,550
Key doesn't sound very high tech.

156
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,060
An asymmetric algorithm key
that's committed to memory.

157
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,020
Without it, the software won't work.

158
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,430
It's just random ones and
zeros, completely worthless.

159
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,260
So, you see, NCIS has nothing
to worry about, gentlemen.

160
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,730
Great, except that's not why we're here.

161
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,410
Who has the “Honor” key committed to memory?

162
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,630
Our project leader,
Lieutenant Commander Tanner.

163
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,550
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- We may have a problem, Boss.

164
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,420
- May have?
- The “Honor” code thingy

165
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,780
Commander Tanner was working
on may have been stolen.

166
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,460
I’m trying to confirm it right now.

167
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:24,150
- What's it supposed to do?
- Break any encryption in use today.

168
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,700
Well, yeah, DiNozzo. I'd say
that sounds like a problem.

169
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,760
And it gets worse, Boss.

170
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,490
According to the people here

171
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,570
Tanner's the only one who can make it work.

172
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,210
All right, I’m heading your way.

173
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,170
Just got to drop off Zach's pod thing first.

174
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,010
Agent Gibbs.

175
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,450
You calling about your pod
thing you left on my desk?

176
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,150
No, he's here, the man from the park.

177
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,020
Let me talk to your social worker, Zach.

178
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,360
I'm not in her office. As
soon as I saw him, I took off.

179
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,030
- Where are you?
- Outside on the street.

180
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,100
Zach, I'm a few blocks from
you. Stay right where you are.

181
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:06,100
- I can't, he's leaving.
- Zach, listen to me.

182
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,470
- I need you to…
- He knows where my Dad is.

183
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,640
We can't let him get away, hurry.

184
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,340
Zach.

185
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,740
Help. Help.

186
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,350
- NCIS, let the kid go.
- Gibbs.

187
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,350
You little bastard.

188
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,900
Go. Go. Go.

189
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,700
It's okay.

190
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,960
New hires just keep getting
younger, Madam Director?

191
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,950
Obviously, you didn't get
the memo, Agent DiNozzo.

192
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,590
What memo?

193
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,700
The one where it explains the next person

194
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,420
who calls her madam gets keel-hauled.

195
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,000
Whatever that is.

196
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,830
- It's…
- Unpleasant.

197
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,970
Tell Gibbs I want him upstairs.

198
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,350
- What did the Director want?
- You.

199
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,680
Upstairs.

200
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,350
I better check on those sketches.

201
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,260
I got a BOLO out on a black Chevy
Suburban, Boss, but without plates.

202
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,730
DiNozzo, you will spend the next
24 personally checking each one

203
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,400
in Virginia, Maryland, and DC.

204
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,200
That's like an impossible… I'm on that.

205
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,870
You keep an eye on him for me.

206
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,770
I'll be right back.

207
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,430
You know, he was just kidding
when he said keeping an eye on me.

208
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,430
I couldn't remember when Gibbs
asked me, but I think I got it right.

209
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:55,300
- Got what right?
- The numbers on the license plate.

210
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,950
I was scared, but I remember
most of the numbers.

211
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,980
All right, Zach.

212
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,280
My man. Come on, give me 5.

213
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,320
Come on, meet me up high.

214
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,860
All right, we'll work on that.

215
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,760
Good job.

216
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
Always admired your way with children.

217
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,630
Ever think of having any of your own?

218
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,630
Is that an offer, Jen?

219
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:32,310
No, it wasn't an offer, Jethro.
It was merely an observation.

220
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,500
You know why I get along with kids so well?

221
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,950
Because when they lie, they don't
have the guile to get away with it.

222
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,280
You wanted to see me?

223
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,790
I have spent the last hour on video
conference with the Directors

224
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,870
of the FBI, NSA and Homeland Security.

225
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,190
Your kind of tea party.

226
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,860
If Project Honor's compromised, it
will cripple our intelligence networks.

227
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,100
They all want jurisdiction on this one.

228
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,870
- And you said?
- I have my best agent working it.

229
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,010
Now, tell me you have something.

230
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,910
The same men who kidnapped the
Commander went after his son.

231
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,480
Have you considered that he
might not have been kidnapped?

232
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,550
- I have, I don't buy it.
- And?

233
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,820
- Your famous gut again?
- No.

234
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,860
His son.

235
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,260
Abs, give me good news.

236
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,200
Oh, my God. I got this e-mail that
says I may have won $50 million.

237
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,670
And I'm really, really psyched.

238
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,430
Oh, you mean about the case?

239
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,910
I've been going through Q & R security logs.

240
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,440
It's like the Fort Knox of computer systems.

241
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,340
Next generation anti-virus
software, intrusion detection.

242
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,140
- Crypto processors, ACLs, firewalls.
- Hey, hey.

243
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,420
Okay. No one can penetrate the system, Gibbs.

244
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,620
It could be disabled if someone
had a high enough clearance.

245
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,090
- It's an inside job.
- Q & R is monitored 24/7.

246
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,730
All employees have passwords
to gain access to the system.

247
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,660
Like digital fingerprints. Every
keystroke recorded for posterity.

248
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:07,270
At 3 am this morning, someone
planted a virus into the network.

249
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,570
It shut down the security
system exactly 1 hour.

250
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,740
Long enough to breach the network,
remove the software, plant the viruses.

251
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,070
Go.

252
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,480
The virus originated from
Commander Tanner's terminal, sir.

253
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:22,680
- Someone else could have used it.
- No, sir. The data is very clear.

254
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,380
Pointing out that Q & R's security
system was designed to be accurate.

255
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,290
- Under the circumstances…
- Chip.

256
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,300
He's right about the design, though.

257
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,060
Who designed it?

258
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,170
Q & R's Risk Management team.

259
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,070
But all of their people are
former law enforcement and military.

260
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,330
- At the highest level.
- Tanner was at the highest level too.

261
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,740
Tony is reviewing statements
from the employees.

262
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm reviewing the computer terminals,
but the virus wiped a lot of files.

263
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
It doesn't look good for the Commander, Boss.

264
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,650
Wipe that dirt off your lip.

265
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,150
Dirt?

266
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,630
I feel like I've wasted
your time, Agent DiNozzo.

267
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:12,430
- Bite your tongue. You've been great.
- I just feel bad for that poor little boy.

268
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,970
Well, listen.

269
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,160
If you think of anything,

270
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,270
you give me a call,

271
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,640
day or night.

272
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,310
Home phone number's on the back.

273
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,250
Where have you been? I could've used
your help with those interviews.

274
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,760
You look like you had
your hands full with her.

275
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,490
Watch your sexual innuendo
around the kid. He's had a hard day.

276
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,790
He's taking it better than
most adults. He's resilient.

277
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,370
Do you see the way he’s been acting around me?

278
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,540
I think it's because he
doesn't like you, Tony.

279
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,140
Kids dig me.

280
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,540
No they don't.

281
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,810
Zach. Zacharoo, buddy. Come on over here, man.

282
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,500
I was gonna wait until tomorrow
when everyone was here

283
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,020
but considering what a
brave little boy you've been

284
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,190
and how much you've helped us,

285
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:08,730
I'm gonna make you an honorary NCIS Agent.

286
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,490
Thanks. I've got to go to the head.

287
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,930
Yes, Tony. I was mistaken.

288
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,440
Your way with children is only
rivaled by your way with women.

289
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,040
He's under a lot of stress.

290
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,500
- Where’s Zach?
- Potty break, Boss.

291
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,110
You gonna speak?

292
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:36,050
I got an ID on one of our suspects.
His name is Vincent Pazzo.

293
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,320
Italian-born. Freelance mercenary.
Black ops mostly. Some wet work.

294
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,890
How'd you find out about that?

295
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,960
I sent Zach's sketches to
some people who owe me a favor.

296
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,960
If he's got the “Honor” program and the
guy who knows how to make it work,

297
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,570
then why'd they go after his kid?

298
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,860
To force him to cooperate.

299
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,100
There's a possibility
Commander Tanner set this up

300
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,860
to make it look like kidnapping.

301
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,440
Keep your voice down.

302
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,550
That's what I would do if it were my op.

303
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,740
Authorities are looking for a kidnapper,
they should look for a traitor.

304
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,720
It doesn't feel right, Ziva.

305
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,150
It doesn't have to feel
right to be right, Gibbs.

306
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,660
Gibbs, can I ask you a question?

307
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah, shoot.

308
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,140
How are you going to get this
out of here when it's finished?

309
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,740
Good question. I don't know.
I haven't thought about it much.

310
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,180
I think maybe you could
use a crane or something.

311
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,680
Yeah? I could dig a ramp.

312
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,190
Knock that wall out and hoist it out of here.

313
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:49,750
I went sailing once with
my Dad and Commander Wilder.

314
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,690
Didn't go too well.

315
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,130
- Did you get seasick?
- My Dad did.

316
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,300
Commander Wilder thought it was funny.

317
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,800
You know, my Dad being in the Navy and all.

318
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,100
Yeah.

319
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,510
- You're going to find him, right?
- Oh, yeah, we'll find him.

320
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,210
- Promise?
- Yeah.

321
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,950
I promise you.

322
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,050
Wanna give me a hand?

323
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:20,420
- Don't know how.
- Come on over here.

324
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,920
I don't wanna ruin it.

325
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,820
You're not going to ruin anything. Come here.

326
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,170
See, you always want to go
with the grain of the wood.

327
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,230
Put your hand there.
Put your weight behind it.

328
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,070
Back and forth, real even.

329
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,840
- Where’s Gibbs?
- Home with Zach. What's up?

330
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,240
Commander Tanner's bank statement.

331
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,580
Do Americans usually empty
out their bank accounts

332
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,380
before they take children to the park?

333
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,820
You're kidding.

334
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,750
Savings, checking, money market, $23,000.

335
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,650
Gibbs is not gonna like this.

336
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,490
Are we solving this case to please him?

337
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,190
I got a trace on the Chevy Suburban.

338
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,670
Zach missed 2 numbers on the
plate but I found the vehicle.

339
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,030
Rental car out of Maryland.

340
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,110
ID's fake. Credit card was stolen.
But that's our other kidnapper.

341
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,170
Does the car have a navigation
system? We could use the GPS.

342
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,070
2 words for you, McGee: Lo and Jack.

343
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,470
That's one word.

344
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,240
- A what?
- It's a… whatever.

345
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,510
I tracked it down to a parking
lot a couple miles from here.

346
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,390
Good job, McGee.

347
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,190
What?

348
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,360
Come on, let's roll.

349
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,090
Where’s the child?

350
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,230
Now, keep your eye on the coin.

351
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,630
Yeah, like his.

352
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,500
Now that, my young friend, is magic.

353
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:47,810
Now, a true magician doesn't reveal
the mysteries of his craft

354
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,710
to anyone else but another magician.

355
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,250
But would you like to learn?

356
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,020
It's in that hand.

357
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,220
Isn't it?

358
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,650
So, it is.

359
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,790
He's quite observant.

360
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,730
Does he remind you of anyone?

361
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,100
Very good.

362
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,540
Got it, Boss. Black SUV, no rear window.

363
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,540
One visible suspect in the vehicle.

364
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,840
Should we take him now?

365
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,450
Wait, I'm almost in position here.

366
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,910
Copy

367
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,420
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather be partner with McGee?

368
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,360
The 2 of you seem to click, and
we're about to storm this vehicle.

369
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,260
- Who knows what's gonna go down.
- Don't worry, Tony, I got your back.

370
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,130
My back. Listen, lady, if anybody
is getting anybody's back,

371
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,430
it's me getting yours.

372
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,970
In position, DiNozzo.

373
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,080
Take him down.

374
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,500
- Ziva, what a pleasure.
- Dr. Mallard.

375
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,510
- Oh, Ducky, please.
- Ducky.

376
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,710
Are you 2 done with the name game?

377
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:31,350
Yeah. Our guest departed this
world only a few hours ago.

378
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,280
But he was in a great deal
of pain before he died.

379
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:35,950
Seems he was wounded.

380
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,020
Single round. The bullet
lodged under his scapula.

381
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,690
- The shoulder blade.
- Doc, I'm gonna guess

382
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,160
- that slug's from my SIG.
- Yeah.

383
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,760
As to the fatal injury, this circular
burn around the entry wound suggests…

384
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,300
A silencer was used.

385
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,240
It was done in haste by someone
with little, if any, experience.

386
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:58,740
If a professional did this, he
would have not left his weapon.

387
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,670
It's untidy. Marks of an amateur.

388
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,870
If it were me, I would
have not been so obvious.

389
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,180
There are literally dozens of
effective ways to eliminate a target

390
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,940
without raising suspicions.

391
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,610
Heroin overdose is popular, but
it requires a history of prior use.

392
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,290
Of course, something like
insulin or potassium can be used

393
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,550
to suggest death by natural causes.

394
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,260
I really must ask you over for dinner.
Mother would love to talk with you.

395
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,170
They cleaned house. I wounded
him when he tried to grab Zach.

396
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,810
After that he was a liability.

397
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,670
Once again, I suggest
Commander Tanner may be involved.

398
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,810
All the evidence says he stole the software.

399
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,340
He cleared out his bank accounts.

400
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,280
He likely killed this man.

401
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,150
From an investigator's point of view,

402
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:44,590
the pieces fit together quite well.

403
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,350
Or not.

404
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,100
- Abby.
- Ballistics lab, sir.

405
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,100
- Serving in the military?
- No, sir, I was…

406
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,830
- Stop standing at attention.
- It's good posture, sir.

407
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,530
- What? No Zachster?
- Abby, you're yelling.

408
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,580
- Oh, sorry, where is he?
- He's upstairs.

409
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,180
He's a cool kid. Reminds me
of you. He's like a mini-Gibbs.

410
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,350
- Austin Powers?
- You calling Zach a Mini-Me?

411
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,110
Gibbs, I am so impressed
with your pop-culture reference.

412
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,520
Tell me about the weapon.

413
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,020
All right. It's a Makarov 380.

414
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,020
It matches the hollow point
slugs from the body downstairs.

415
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,460
And this bad boy that we pulled
from his shoulder matches your SIG.

416
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,360
- Any prints from the .380?
- Dead guy's.

417
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,970
- You have something else?
- I have.

418
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,230
- What?
- Chip shaved.

419
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,340
I didn't notice.

420
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,960
He didn't notice?

421
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,400
He doesn't notice unimportant things, Chip.

422
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,110
Sorry Chip, didn't mean it.

423
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,450
- You getting off, Director?
- Looking for you actually.

424
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,160
I saw Ducky's report on the body downstairs.

425
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:06,390
- That was fast.
- One of the perks of being Director.

426
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,400
I get to read all the good reports.

427
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,100
What's next, Jethro?

428
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,010
Finishing this conversation.

429
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,770
- Don't give me a hard time.
- I didn't realize I was.

430
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,280
The man who supposedly
kidnapped Commander Tanner

431
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,180
is lying dead in our autopsy room.

432
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:28,120
Tanner is looking less and less like a victim.

433
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,090
You want back in the field again, Jen?

434
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,260
Tanner has technology

435
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,990
that could set back our
intelligence monitoring 30 years.

436
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,600
Pardon me for taking an interest.

437
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:41,800
And here I thought you just wanted
an excuse to spend time together.

438
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,310
I just want to know that this is about
more than a fatherless child to you.

439
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,640
Boss.

440
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,110
Didn't you notice we're in the middle
of a conversation, Agent McGee?

441
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,840
Sorry, should I come back?

442
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,710
- No.
- Yes.

443
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,360
I'm simply trying to solve
your case here, Director.

444
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,680
Speak.

445
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,720
Commander Wilder is here.

446
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,800
He works with Commander Tanner at Q & R.

447
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,010
Commander Wilder.

448
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,970
I went by his house to
grab some stuff for him.

449
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:24,050
Your agents wouldn't let me in, so
I bought him a Nintendo to play with.

450
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,710
That's the DS. It's an excellent system.

451
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,150
I've heard.

452
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,360
This is a hell of a situation.

453
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,960
Zach's been through so
much in his life already.

454
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,020
Is there a reason you wanted to see me?

455
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,530
Tanner is a close friend.
I was hoping for information.

456
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,500
At Q & R, they're saying he's a suspect.

457
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,370
Do you know the sacrifices
he's made to serve our country?

458
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,100
I do.

459
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,200
I don't care what the computer log says.

460
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,170
Commander Tanner is no traitor.

461
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,570
- What's it gonna take to prove that?
- Finding who is.

462
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,340
Then you should look at
Q & R's civilian employees.

463
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,710
They're falling all over themselves to
try and protect their collective asses.

464
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,490
What about Zach, where's he staying?

465
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,750
With me.

466
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,890
I'm the closest thing he has to
family. I can take him home with me.

467
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,930
Can't do that. He's under protective custody.

468
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,490
You mean they're after Zach too?

469
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,730
We'll take good care of him, Commander.

470
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,800
I'm just gonna say goodbye.

471
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,480
Boss, so did you tell him
we think Tanner's innocent?

472
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,910
We don't know he is.

473
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,580
Do you have something to say, McGee?

474
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:38,390
I've been going through the
evidence we bagged from the vehicle.

475
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,620
Prepaid burn phone. Guess
whose number's on the caller ID.

476
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,260
Frank Connell, Q & R office.

477
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,070
- What the hell are you doing in here?
- I couldn't stop them.

478
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,400
It's not her fault. She's
overwhelmed by search warrant.

479
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
This is out of line. I've been cooperative.

480
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,110
Explain why you called the
kidnappers from this office

481
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,750
the day the “Honor” code went missing.

482
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,470
- That's a ridiculous accusation.
- Denying you were here?

483
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,850
I said in my statement I
was working late that night.

484
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,780
So, you made the call.

485
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,360
Someone's tampered with this hard drive.

486
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,860
Tried to erase the command
logs morning of the robbery.

487
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,650
We had a virus. It corrupted
thousands of files.

488
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,360
- Is that what happened?
- Can't tell until we get to the lab.

489
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,060
Okay, bag and tag.

490
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,170
You cannot remove that
computer from this building.

491
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,670
- Don't worry, you're going with it.
- Go up and call the lawyers.

492
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,980
You have the right to remain silent.

493
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,770
Anything you say can and
will be used against you.

494
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,070
Hey.

495
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,510
- Gibbs got Connell talking?
- His lawyer won't let him,

496
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,590
so, Gibbs is giving him the old stare.

497
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,580
Gibbs does it much better.

498
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,190
- Apple for teacher?
- For McGee.

499
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,330
He's been very generous with me.
Helping me adjust to this new city.

500
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,960
So, you're giving him an apple?

501
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,860
It's a small gesture.

502
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,230
If you wanna thank him,
why don't you get him a date?

503
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,530
Gibbs wants to know if you've got
anything he can use on Connell.

504
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,400
Frank Connell's a deacon at his church.

505
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,970
Never had a moving violation,
let alone a parking ticket.

506
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,670
He calls his Mother every Sunday.
The man is spick-and-spam.

507
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,810
The saying is spick-and-span.
Spam is lunch meat.

508
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,720
- What exactly is span, then?
- Span is…

509
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,510
I'll get back to you on that.

510
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,520
In my opinion, Frank Connell's not involved.

511
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:25,190
Good. I'll let Gibbs know right away
because he loves to hear our opinions.

512
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,020
He's distracted by his affections.

513
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,500
- Gibbs doesn't get distracted.
- What do you call it, then?

514
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,170
The Boss moves in mysterious
ways. Get this to him.

515
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,370
- Why me?
- I'm gonna go see your buddy McGee.

516
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,070
- Hey, put that back.
- I'm just bringing it to him.

517
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,280
Progress report, McGee.

518
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,690
I think that Frank Connell put a
trace on Commander Tanner's computer.

519
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,260
- Think?
- Well,

520
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,520
I've got scraps of code, protocols, commands.

521
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,960
He might have put the trace in,
collected Tanner's passwords,

522
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,360
stolen the software.

523
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,900
"Might have" and "think" are
not going to make Gibbs happy.

524
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:10,540
Whoever wiped his files did a good job.
There is nothing left but fragments.

525
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,270
Can't Gibbs just bring
Connell in interrogation?

526
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,180
Not with a $500-an-hour defense
attorney breathing down his neck.

527
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,540
Puts it on you, McGee.

528
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,980
Nothing I have found
contradicts any of the evidence

529
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,410
we have against Commander Tanner.

530
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,420
I'm with you, Probie. But he's
feeling pretty strong about this one.

531
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:30,560
Has anyone considered the fact
that Gibbs may be wrong this time?

532
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,990
McGee, bite your tongue.
Gibbs knows what he's doing.

533
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,960
- We just have to show him love.
- We show the love, Abby.

534
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,970
Just don't want to let the bad guys
get away while we're doing it.

535
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,740
Almost blocked my shot there, Chipper.

536
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,140
- Ever play ball?
- College.

537
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,470
Yeah? Me too.

538
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,740
- Tony ran point for Ohio State.
- What conference did you play in?

539
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,980
- We didn't exactly have a conference.
- Division?

540
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:59,250
Not really. It was more
of an intramural thing.

541
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,290
Skins and mustaches?

542
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,160
What do you got for me?

543
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,000
Chip?

544
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,790
Fingerprint analysis results.

545
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,440
- You're free to go, Chip.
- I don't mind staying late, ma'am.

546
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,670
Go home, Chip, please.

547
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,140
- Is that an order?
- Yes, go.

548
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,650
I don't know how you concentrate around him.

549
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,060
I know. No, no, no.

550
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,890
No. I'm too good at what I do.

551
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,620
No, you're not.

552
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:46,230
- I am. Gibbs is going to hate me for it.
- What happened?

553
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,030
I was following up on the murder weapon.

554
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,300
- Double-check for anything I missed.
- Was there?

555
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,640
- Fingerprints.
- On the gun?

556
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,970
- On the rounds in the magazine.
- That's great.

557
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:57,410
Most people get obsessed
cleaning the grip and trigger.

558
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,480
They don't think twice about the bullets.

559
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,580
Now we've got a nice
partial thumb, a forefinger

560
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:04,020
- and a perfect index print.
- Amazing.

561
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:07,160
- Yeah, I know.
- So, whos’ prints are they?

562
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,980
Commander Tanner's.

563
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,700
Yeah.

564
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:25,270
Yeah. At this rate we'll have
her seaworthy in no time.

565
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,770
Maybe my Dad can help when he gets back.

566
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,180
Hubba-hubba.

567
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,380
Dinner at the White House?

568
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,990
A date, actually.

569
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,160
Must be an important guy for
you to get all decked out.

570
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,820
I'd prefer if you just told
me that you liked my dress.

571
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,060
I haven't decided yet.

572
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,900
Do you mind giving us a moment?

573
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:56,170
Zach, why don't you go
upstairs and grab a soda.

574
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,680
How long are you planning on
keeping Frank Connell locked up?

575
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:10,580
You make a house call to reprimand me, Jen?

576
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,980
You got Commander Tanner's
fingerprints on the bullets

577
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,680
- of the murder weapon.
- Well, I'm not sure he did it.

578
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,690
Why? And don't tell me your famous gut again.

579
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,800
Zach is a great kid, Jethro.

580
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,940
Doesn't mean his Father's not a bastard.

581
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,370
He might be, but Zach's our only link to him.

582
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,810
He might make another
attempt to get Zach back?

583
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,640
If he does I'll be waiting for him.

584
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,580
My Dad didn't do anything wrong.

585
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,050
It's a complicated situation.

586
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,090
- It's not.
- Zach.

587
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,520
Zach, there is evidence
he did something wrong.

588
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,890
It doesn't matter.

589
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,960
I know in my stomach he
didn't do anything wrong.

590
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,600
You promised you'd bring
him back to me, Gibbs.

591
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,330
Please.

592
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,140
- Where’s Zach?
- Ducky's.

593
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:12,780
Listen, I spent half the night taking
Frank Connell's hard drive apart.

594
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:17,120
There's nothing. We need to accept
Commander Tanner sold the software.

595
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,090
I'm not accepting anything.

596
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,460
- Boss…
- Look at this a different way.

597
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,600
I agree. I just talked to the CIA.

598
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,090
They were very cooperative.

599
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,760
- They were?
- He owed me a favor.

600
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,460
How many people owe you favors?

601
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,800
How many dates does Tony go on a month?

602
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,640
This is from Kosovo in the late '90s.

603
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,670
The man with the shaved head is Vincent Pazzo.

604
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,110
The one on the left is Willis Hirst.

605
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:44,380
They were mercenaries for
the Kosovo Liberation Army.

606
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,450
- Freedom fighters.
- Not exactly.

607
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,980
They worked for a warlord as specialists.

608
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,890
- What specialty?
- Coercion.

609
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,520
Torture.

610
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,690
But the evidence we have
against Commander Tanner?

611
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,890
This is a covert operation.
Take nothing at face value.

612
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,330
They framed Commander Tanner as a diversion.

613
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,700
While they torture him for the access code.

614
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,310
Maybe he won't talk.

615
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,670
Have you ever been tortured, McGee?

616
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:15,240
There's only so much torment
a human body can bear.

617
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,880
Strong men break in a few days,
nobody holds out forever.

618
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,520
Not even Gibbs.

619
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,880
To a trained interrogator,
can be done in less time.

620
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,840
I can get that code in hours.

621
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,820
They've had him for 2 days.

622
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,360
He's running out of time
if he hasn't talked already.

623
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,930
A few hours?

624
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,720
Give or take.

625
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:38,140
I'm putting you in a room with
Frank Connell, you have 40 minutes.

626
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,500
- I'd hold off on that, Boss.
- Where have you been?

627
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,770
Tracking down the store where our dead guy

628
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,640
purchased his cell phone.
Not easy, by the way.

629
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:49,510
The language barrier between me and
Mr. Singh was no piece of cake either.

630
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,010
Once I convinced him I wasn't
going to shut down his store

631
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,210
he gave me his surveillance videotapes.

632
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,790
- Is this poppy seed?
- Where is the video?

633
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:00,550
Abby's lab. Sorry, Boss.
She's scanning the tapes now.

634
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,190
The phone was purchased with cash,

635
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,420
a week before Commander Tanner disappeared.

636
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,800
Pause the tape.

637
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,930
That woman's got 4 phones in her hands.

638
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,670
Zoom in, Abs.

639
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,940
Oh, yeah. The lips and the angle
of the chin, the curve of the neck.

640
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,710
Okay, we got it, Tony. She's attractive.

641
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,320
It's Laura Osgood. Frank Connell's assistant.

642
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,450
I'll make you a print.

643
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,560
I hate it when they do that.

644
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,430
What's going on?

645
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,900
You bought phones connected to
a robbery, kidnapping and murder.

646
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,310
Her number matches several
calls on the kidnapper's phone.

647
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,210
You're done.

648
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,910
Only way to help yourself is
tell us everything you know.

649
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,810
I want a lawyer.

650
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,990
Commander Tanner's been gone for 47 hours.

651
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,720
If he's not dead yet, he soon will be.

652
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,530
Maybe we can convince her to
change her mind about the lawyer.

653
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,290
I can convince her far more than that.

654
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,530
How long?

655
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,000
Not long.

656
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,170
McGee, are you thirsty?

657
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,170
Come on. I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

658
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:49,120
Boss, what exactly is Ziva doing in there?

659
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,060
I don't want to know.

660
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,900
It was a 3-man team.

661
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,580
I was on the inside.

662
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,220
I put a trace on Commander Tanner's
computer to get his passwords.

663
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,220
I planted the virus using his log-in.

664
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,550
Keep going, Laura.

665
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:14,820
Pazzo and Hirst grabbed Commander
Tanner to get the access code.

666
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,000
- Who set it up?
- I don't know.

667
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,060
We were contacted separately.

668
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:26,430
Money was wired. Instructions
e-mailed on an anonymous server.

669
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,300
Where is he?

670
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:32,400
Commander Tanner, where is he being tortured?

671
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,210
That wasn't part of my assignment.

672
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,320
Please, they'll kill me.

673
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:48,250
It's a garage near Coleman Park.

674
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,370
- Yeah?
- Code checks out.

675
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,040
- Proceed as planned.
- All right, I'll go clean up.

676
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,230
Clear.

677
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,670
Commander Tanner.

678
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,420
- Zach?
- All right. He's safe. We’ve got him.

679
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,990
They told me they had him.

680
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,180
If I didn't give them the
code, they'll kill him.

681
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,790
- You gave them the key?
- I had to.

682
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,090
They had my son. They showed me proof.

683
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,290
What proof?

684
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:15,910
Agent Gibbs? What in the hell's going on?

685
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,340
I'm not resisting.

686
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,640
Too bad.

687
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:24,490
I could have never hurt Zach.
It was strictly business.

688
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,160
We'll be sure to let him know that.

689
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,310
Are you okay?

690
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,250
I guess.

691
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,550
Commander Wilder was my Dad's…

692
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,490
He was my friend, Gibbs.

693
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,890
I should have known.

694
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:11,000
I shouldn't have let him fool me like that.

695
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:15,170
Zach, sometimes really bad people

696
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:18,040
are good at fooling you.

697
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,880
Anybody bad ever fool you?

698
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,550
Oh, yeah, more than once.

699
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:32,250
Someday I'm going to find them
and put them all in jail.

700
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,050
I believe you will.

701
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:36,990
Zach.

702
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:40,430
Dad. Daddy. Daddy.

703
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,290
You're all right.

704
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,230
I knew you'd never leave me.

705
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,870
- I'm all right. Everything’s all right.
- I love you, Daddy.
