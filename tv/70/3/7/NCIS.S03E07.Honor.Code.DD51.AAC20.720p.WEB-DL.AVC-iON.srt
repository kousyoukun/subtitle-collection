1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,050
Hey, Zach. Zachary.

2
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:12,804
What did l say about wandering off?
You have to be careful of strangers.

3
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,057
- Sorry.
- Here.

4
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:18,894
Dad, balloons are for babies.

5
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,480
Right. What about
that cotton candy? ls that still--?

6
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:25,442
Oh, no. That's fine.
We could share it after my ride.

7
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:28,028
l'll try to save you some.
lt looks awfully good to me.

8
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:31,615
Dad. After the ride.

9
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,786
l'll be watching you.

10
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,698
Dad.

11
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,867
Dad.

12
00:02:12,457 --> 00:02:14,167
A whole hour for a lunch run,
probie?

13
00:02:14,376 --> 00:02:16,461
Yeah, while Ziva and l were out,

14
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:19,047
she asked me to show her
the best routes to work.

15
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:23,427
Her driving has gotten a lot better.
Barely broke any laws this time.

16
00:02:24,136 --> 00:02:25,178
Let me get this straight.

17
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:27,013
Ziva asked you,

18
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,184
who can barely navigate the Navy yard,
to show her the best way to work?

19
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:33,311
- That's right.
- Well, what about me?

20
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:35,647
l know every shortcut
in the metro area.

21
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,983
l could shave ten minutes off her
commute like that.

22
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,443
l don't know what to tell you.

23
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:45,782
lt doesn't make any sense.

24
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,078
Unless...

25
00:02:51,913 --> 00:02:53,832
...maybe l intimidate her.

26
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,500
Yeah, l'm sure that's it.

27
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,919
l've seen it happen before.
lt's a chemical thing.

28
00:02:58,128 --> 00:03:01,423
- Hard to explain.
- l do hope you try.

29
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:03,050
l told you not to do that again.

30
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,428
Sorry. l was so intimidated by your
presence, l must have forgotten.

31
00:03:06,595 --> 00:03:11,808
Seriously. l do apologize for not asking
your advice on my commute.

32
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:13,477
Don't worry about it.

33
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:17,022
lf l would have known you would have
felt so emasculated--

34
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:19,649
- ls that the word? Emasculated.
- Yes, it is. Emasculated.

35
00:03:19,858 --> 00:03:22,194
l would have asked you first.

36
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,362
lt takes a little more
than an exotic accent

37
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:26,948
and some stealth ninja moves
to emasculate me.

38
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:30,702
Only a little more?
How disappointing.

39
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:33,914
Don't take sides, probie.

40
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:38,585
Gear up. We have a missing person.
Coleman Park Carousel in Arlington.

41
00:03:38,794 --> 00:03:40,087
- A child?
- Father.

42
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:42,339
Lieutenant Commander
Alex Tanner.

43
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:44,091
Disappeared an hour ago.

44
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:47,386
Do you always respond to
missing persons cases so promptly?

45
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:51,098
Special circumstances, Ziva.
His 6-year-old son called NClS.

46
00:03:51,306 --> 00:03:54,851
He's in the park, alone, waiting for us.
DiNozzo, you drive.

47
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,478
l think McGee wants to drive, boss.

48
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:59,898
You know what, Tony?
l would really rather have you drive.

49
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,775
Afraid to run over another
fire hydrant?

50
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:05,946
l'm sure that wasn't your fault.
lt was, according to the police report.

51
00:04:06,154 --> 00:04:08,615
- l'll drive.
- One more word, you're all walking.

52
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:11,034
You got it, boss.

53
00:04:12,577 --> 00:04:14,413
l deserved that.

54
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:25,757
Zach.

55
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:29,219
Hey, l'm Special Agent DiNozzo,
you can call me Tony, okay?

56
00:04:29,428 --> 00:04:33,724
That's a smart thing to do,
calling NClS. Good boy.

57
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:38,395
l know this really scary, but l want you
to be brave. Can you do that?

58
00:04:39,855 --> 00:04:43,525
Okay, l want you to think back
to what happened today.

59
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:46,820
Try to remember the details.

60
00:04:47,904 --> 00:04:49,781
There's no wrong answer here.

61
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,076
- What do we know?
- Nothing. l think the kid's in shock.

62
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:54,828
No, l'm not.

63
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:58,040
l'm waiting for Agent DiNozzo
to ask me a question.

64
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,126
What kinds of questions
was l supposed to ask?

65
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:05,338
What l saw. Why l called NClS.

66
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,885
What did you see, Zach?

67
00:05:10,302 --> 00:05:14,097
Two men were watching us.
l think they kidnapped my Dad.

68
00:05:15,307 --> 00:05:16,933
Describe them.

69
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:20,312
Dark glasses.
One had a military haircut.

70
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,772
One had a shaved head.

71
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,484
- How old?
- About your age.

72
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:28,153
They had iPods too.

73
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:32,657
lt's like a Walkman, boss. An iPod.

74
00:05:33,492 --> 00:05:37,287
They were only listening
in one ear like this.

75
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:43,251
Be back in a minute, Zach.

76
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:47,005
- Dark glasses, earwigs.
- Sounds like feds.

77
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:51,760
You think the FBl would arrest a man
and leave his kid in the park, DiNozzo?

78
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:53,553
Maybe our commander took a walk.

79
00:05:53,762 --> 00:05:55,806
My father left me in the Maui Hilton
for two days.

80
00:05:56,014 --> 00:05:58,767
He didn't realize l was missing
until he got the room service bill.

81
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:00,936
Sad, but enlightening.

82
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,355
Boss, l just spoke
with the commander's C.O.

83
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,898
He's very concerned.

84
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,983
Apparently, Commander Tanner
was working

85
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,194
on a highly classified DOD project.

86
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:10,779
What project, McGee?

87
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:13,115
l don't-- He wouldn't say
over an unsecured line

88
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:14,574
but l'm going to find out.

89
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,201
Footage from the security cameras?

90
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,995
Park Security released them to me.

91
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:24,543
Okay, get ahold of Zach's mom.
And then she can pick him up at NClS.

92
00:06:24,793 --> 00:06:26,795
Boss. Boss.

93
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:31,049
His mother's dead.
Killed four years ago in a car accident.

94
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:35,053
Primary next of kin?

95
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,013
There is none.

96
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:40,809
Just Commander Tanner
and his son.

97
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:46,940
These guys are definitely pros.

98
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:48,734
They keep their faces
from the camera.

99
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,403
All we've got to go on
is the kid's description of them.

100
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,655
You know, it doesn't look
like a kidnapping to me.

101
00:06:54,364 --> 00:06:56,575
- They don't have guns.
- Barely touched the commander.

102
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,201
They could have threatened his son.

103
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:00,495
Explains why they left him alone
in the park.

104
00:07:00,704 --> 00:07:02,581
What do we know
about Commander Tanner?

105
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:05,375
Well, boss, he is a brilliant man.

106
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:08,378
A dual Ph.D. from Caltech
in Number and Chaos Theory.

107
00:07:08,545 --> 00:07:10,088
l was reading his thesis online.

108
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:12,466
He manages to link
non-relativistic quantum effects--

109
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,761
Well, that's useful
to this case, McGee.

110
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:19,639
Last three years he's been
the Navy's liaison

111
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:22,601
with a defence contractor,
Q and R Software.

112
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:24,644
Been the project lead on Honor.

113
00:07:24,853 --> 00:07:27,439
- Which is?
- Classified.

114
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:31,651
l put a call to the head of security over
there. No one's gotten back to me.

115
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:34,071
So l thought l would pay them a visit?

116
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:36,365
Yeah, that's a good answer.
Tony go with him.

117
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,078
The sketch artist is done
with Zach's descriptions.

118
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:43,121
The boy has a remarkable memory.

119
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,625
There's also someone here
from Social Security to pick him up.

120
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,253
Services, Ziva.
Social Security is for older people.

121
00:07:50,462 --> 00:07:51,755
Noted.

122
00:07:51,963 --> 00:07:55,550
- Do you want me to tell the boy?
- No, l'll handle it. Here, sit down.

123
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,929
Put out a BOLO on the composites.

124
00:08:00,097 --> 00:08:01,181
Hey, Zach.

125
00:08:02,265 --> 00:08:05,602
- Good job on the sketches, man.
- Thanks.

126
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:09,856
That's Social Services, huh?

127
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,776
They'll take care of you
until we get your dad back.

128
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:15,529
l can take care of myself.

129
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:17,364
l don't doubt that.

130
00:08:19,574 --> 00:08:23,787
- But l still have to go.
- Yeah, just for a while. Come on.

131
00:08:23,995 --> 00:08:28,625
What if you--? What if you don't find
my dad, Agent Gibbs?

132
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:31,753
l'll find him, Zach. l'll find him.

133
00:08:31,962 --> 00:08:33,380
Hey.

134
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:39,636
lf you ever need me
or even if you just want to talk,

135
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:42,764
you call, okay?

136
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:48,854
l'm sorry we didn't get back to you
right away.

137
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,897
We've been having some problems
of our own.

138
00:08:51,106 --> 00:08:53,692
- What kind of problems?
- Honestly, l don't know.

139
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,403
l'm only Mr. Connell's assistant.
l'm sure he can--

140
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:59,322
That's been happening
for the last half-hour or so.

141
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:02,034
They should snap back on.

142
00:09:05,537 --> 00:09:06,830
Are you all right, Ms. Osgood?

143
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,832
- lt's Laura.
- Laura.

144
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,753
Ms. Osgood.

145
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:15,547
l'll take it from here.

146
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:19,843
- Frank Connell, Q and R security.
- You certainly got here fast.

147
00:09:20,052 --> 00:09:23,722
We just found out about the break-in
ourselves an hour ago.

148
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:28,518
At 0300 this morning,
our network was breached.

149
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:32,522
We didn't detect the intrusion until we
attempted to boot up our main servers.

150
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:35,150
Since then, we've had our hands full
tracking the viruses

151
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:36,610
they embedded in our system.

152
00:09:36,818 --> 00:09:38,779
Do we know yet
what data's been compromised?

153
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:41,031
lt's clear they were after
a working copy of Honor

154
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:44,534
but fortunately it's protected by a key
that exists outside our system.

155
00:09:44,743 --> 00:09:46,912
Key doesn't sound very high tech.

156
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,414
An asymmetric algorithm key
that's committed to memory.

157
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,375
Without it, the software won't work.

158
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,794
lt's just random ones and zeros,
completely worthless.

159
00:09:54,086 --> 00:09:56,630
So you see, NClS has nothing
to worry about, gentlemen.

160
00:09:56,838 --> 00:09:59,091
Great. Except that's not
why we're here.

161
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,760
Who has the Honor key
committed to memory?

162
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,012
Our project leader,
Lieutenant Commander Tanner.

163
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,899
<i>- Yeah, Gibbs.
- We may have a problem, boss.</i>

164
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:17,776
<i>- May have?
- The Honor code thingy</i>

165
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,153
Commander Tanner was working on
may have been stolen.

166
00:10:20,362 --> 00:10:21,822
<i>l'm trying to confirm it right now.</i>

167
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,534
- What's it supposed to do?
- Break any encryption in use today.

168
00:10:25,742 --> 00:10:28,078
Well, yeah, DiNozzo.
l'd say that sounds like a problem.

169
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:30,122
<i>And it gets worse, boss.</i>

170
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,873
According to the people here

171
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:33,917
Tanner's the only one
who can make it work.

172
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:35,585
<i>All right. l'm heading your way.</i>

173
00:10:35,794 --> 00:10:39,548
Just got to drop off
Zach's pod thing first.

174
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:44,386
Agent Gibbs.

175
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:47,806
You calling about your pod thing
you left on my desk?

176
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:51,518
No. He's here.
The man from the park.

177
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:53,395
Let me talk to your
social worker, Zach.

178
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:57,733
l'm not in her office.
As soon as l saw him, l took off.

179
00:10:58,066 --> 00:11:00,402
<i>- Where are you?
- Outside on the street.</i>

180
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,447
Zach, l'm a few blocks from you.
Stay right where you are.

181
00:11:03,655 --> 00:11:07,451
<i>- l can't. He's leaving.
- Zach, listen to me.</i>

182
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:09,828
<i>- l need you to--
- He knows where my dad is.</i>

183
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:12,998
We can't let him get away. Hurry.

184
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,708
<i>Zach.</i>

185
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:54,373
Help. Help.

186
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,958
- NClS. Let the kid go.
- Gibbs.

187
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,964
You little bastard.

188
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,512
Go. Go. Go.

189
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,313
lt's okay.

190
00:12:29,658 --> 00:12:32,577
New hires just keep getting younger,
Madam Director?

191
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:36,581
Obviously you didn't get the memo,
Agent DiNozzo.

192
00:12:37,165 --> 00:12:38,208
What memo?

193
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,293
The one where it explains
the next person

194
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,046
who calls her madam
gets keel-hauled.

195
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:44,631
Whatever that is.

196
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,466
- lt's--
- Unpleasant.

197
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:48,593
Tell Gibbs l want him upstairs.

198
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,979
- What did the director want?
- You.

199
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,314
Upstairs.

200
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,984
l better check on those sketches.

201
00:13:07,696 --> 00:13:11,867
l got a BOLO out on a black Chevy
Suburban, boss, but without plates.

202
00:13:12,117 --> 00:13:15,328
DiNozzo, you will spend the next
24 personally checking each one

203
00:13:15,537 --> 00:13:17,998
in Virginia, Maryland, and D.C.

204
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,834
That's like an impossible--
l'm on that.

205
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,506
You keep an eye on him for me.

206
00:13:26,882 --> 00:13:28,383
l'll be right back.

207
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:46,026
You know, he was just kidding
when he said keeping an eye on me.

208
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:51,031
l couldn't remember when Gibbs
asked me, but l think l got it right.

209
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:56,912
- Got what right?
- The numbers on the license plate.

210
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,544
l was scared, but l remember
most of the numbers.

211
00:14:04,753 --> 00:14:07,589
All right, Zach.

212
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:09,883
My man. Come on. Give me five.

213
00:14:11,802 --> 00:14:13,929
Come on, meet me up high.

214
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,474
All right. We'll work on that.

215
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,393
Good job.

216
00:14:21,937 --> 00:14:23,939
Always admired your way
with children.

217
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:26,233
Ever think of having
any of your own?

218
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,235
ls that an offer, Jen?

219
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:33,907
No, it wasn't an offer, Jethro.
lt was merely an observation.

220
00:14:34,116 --> 00:14:37,119
You know why l get along with kids
so well?

221
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:42,582
Because when they lie, they don't have
the guile to get away with it.

222
00:14:47,337 --> 00:14:48,922
You wanted to see me?

223
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,426
l have spent the last hour on video
conference with the directors

224
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:55,470
of the FBl, NSA
and Homeland Security.

225
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:56,805
Your kind of tea party.

226
00:14:57,013 --> 00:15:00,475
lf Project Honor's compromised,
it will cripple our intelligence networks.

227
00:15:00,726 --> 00:15:02,728
They all want jurisdiction
on this one.

228
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:06,481
- And you said?
- l have my best agent working it.

229
00:15:07,232 --> 00:15:10,610
Now, tell me you have something.

230
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:13,530
The same men who kidnapped
the commander went after his son.

231
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,116
Have you considered that he might not
have been kidnapped?

232
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:18,160
- l have. l don't buy it.
- And?

233
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:20,454
- Your famous gut again?
- No.

234
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,456
His son.

235
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:28,879
Abs, give me good news.

236
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,798
Oh, my God. l got this e-mail that says
l may have won $50 million.

237
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:34,301
And l'm really, really psyched.

238
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:36,053
Oh, you mean about the case?

239
00:15:36,678 --> 00:15:38,513
l've been going through
Q and R security logs.

240
00:15:38,764 --> 00:15:41,058
lt's like the Fort Knox
of computer systems.

241
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,977
Next generation anti-virus software,
intrusion detection.

242
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:47,773
- Crypto processors, ACLs, firewalls.
- Hey, hey.

243
00:15:48,774 --> 00:15:51,026
Okay. No one can penetrate
the system, Gibbs.

244
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,237
lt could be disabled if someone had
a high enough clearance.

245
00:15:54,404 --> 00:15:57,699
- lt's an inside job.
- Q and R is monitored 24/7.

246
00:15:57,908 --> 00:16:00,327
All employees have passwords
to gain access to the system.

247
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,289
Like digital fingerprints.
Every keystroke recorded for posterity.

248
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:08,877
At 3 a.m. this morning, someone
planted a virus into the network.

249
00:16:09,086 --> 00:16:11,171
lt shut down the security system
exactly one hour.

250
00:16:11,713 --> 00:16:15,342
Long enough to breach the network,
remove the software, plant the viruses.

251
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:16,676
Go.

252
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:20,097
The virus originated from
Commander Tanner's terminal, sir.

253
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:24,309
- Someone else could have used it.
- No, sir. The data is very clear.

254
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:28,021
Pointing out that Q and R's security
system was designed to be accurate.

255
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:29,898
- Under the circumstances--
- Chip.

256
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:32,901
He's right about the design, though.

257
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:34,695
Who designed it?

258
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,780
Q and R's risk management team.

259
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:39,700
But all of their people are
former law enforcement and military.

260
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,953
- At the highest level.
- Tanner was at the highest level too.

261
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:45,372
Tony is reviewing statements
from the employees.

262
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:49,626
l'm reviewing the computer terminals,
but the virus wiped a lot of files.

263
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,878
lt doesn't look good
for the commander, boss.

264
00:16:55,632 --> 00:16:58,260
Wipe that dirt off your lip.

265
00:16:58,719 --> 00:16:59,761
Dirt?

266
00:17:06,852 --> 00:17:09,229
l feel like l've wasted your time,
Agent DiNozzo.

267
00:17:09,438 --> 00:17:14,067
- Bite your tongue. You've been great.
- l just feel bad for that poor little boy.

268
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:15,569
Well, listen.

269
00:17:15,736 --> 00:17:16,778
lf you think of anything...

270
00:17:18,155 --> 00:17:19,906
...you give me a call

271
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,241
day or night.

272
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,909
Home phone number's on the back.

273
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,878
Where have you been? l could've used
your help with those interviews.

274
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,380
You look like you had your hands full
with her.

275
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:38,091
Watch your sexual innuendo
around the kid. He's had a hard day.

276
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,428
He's taking it better than most adults.
He's resilient.

277
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:43,972
Do you see the way he's been acting
around me?

278
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:46,141
l think it's because
he doesn't like you, Tony.

279
00:17:46,391 --> 00:17:47,768
Kids dig me.

280
00:17:48,185 --> 00:17:50,145
No they don't.

281
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:53,440
Zach. Zacharoo, buddy.
Come on over here, man.

282
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:58,111
l was gonna wait until tomorrow
when everyone was here

283
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,616
but considering
what a brave little boy you've been

284
00:18:02,824 --> 00:18:04,785
and how much you've helped us,

285
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:10,332
l'm gonna make you
an honorary NClS agent.

286
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,126
Thanks. l've got to go to the head.

287
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,548
Yes, Tony. l was mistaken.

288
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,052
Your way with children is only rivalled
by your way with women.

289
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,637
He's under a lot of stress.

290
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:28,141
- Where's Zach?
- Potty break, boss.

291
00:18:31,436 --> 00:18:32,729
You gonna speak?

292
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:37,651
l got an lD on one of our suspects.
His name is Vincent Pazzo.

293
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:42,948
ltalian-born. Freelance mercenary.
Black ops mostly. Some wet work.

294
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,791
How'd you find out about that?

295
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,877
l sent Zach's sketches to some people
who owe me a favour.

296
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,880
lf he's got the Honor program and the
guy who knows how to make it work,

297
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,465
then why'd they go after his kid?

298
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:53,800
To force him to cooperate.

299
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,011
There's a possibility
Commander Tanner set this up

300
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,804
to make it look like kidnapping.

301
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,350
Keep your voice down.

302
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,477
That's what l would do
if it were my op.

303
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,647
Authorities are looking for a kidnapper,
they should look for a traitor.

304
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,649
lt doesn't feel right, Ziva.

305
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:13,069
lt doesn't have to feel right
to be right, Gibbs.

306
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,581
Gibbs, can l ask you a question?

307
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:26,916
Yeah, shoot.

308
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:32,047
How are you going to get this
out of here when it's finished?

309
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:36,676
Good question. l don't know.
l haven't thought about it much.

310
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:40,096
l think maybe you could use a crane
or something.

311
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:43,600
Yeah? l could dig a ramp.

312
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,102
Knock that wall out
and hoist it out of here.

313
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:51,691
l went sailing once with my dad
and Commander Wilder.

314
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,610
Didn't go too well.

315
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,029
- Did you get seasick?
- My dad did.

316
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,199
Commander Wilder thought
it was funny.

317
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,703
You know,
my dad being in the Navy and all.

318
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,038
Yeah.

319
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:09,417
- You're going to find him, right?
- Oh, yeah. We'll find him.

320
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:13,129
- Promise?
- Yeah.

321
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,882
l promise you.

322
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,967
Wanna give me a hand?

323
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:22,347
- Don't know how.
- Come on over here.

324
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,848
l don't wanna ruin it.

325
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,726
You're not going to ruin anything.
Come here.

326
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:31,064
See, you always want to go
with the grain of the wood.

327
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,149
Put your hand there.
Put your weight behind it.

328
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,986
Back and forth, real even.

329
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,742
- Where's Gibbs?
- Home with Zach. What's up?

330
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:45,161
Commander Tanner's
bank statement.

331
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,497
Do Americans usually empty out
their bank accounts

332
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,290
before they take children
to the park?

333
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:50,750
You're kidding.

334
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:54,671
Savings, checking, money market,
$23,000.

335
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,589
Gibbs is not gonna like this.

336
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,425
Are we solving this case
to please him?

337
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,093
l got a trace
on the Chevy Suburban.

338
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,596
Zach missed two numbers on the plate
but l found the vehicle.

339
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,933
Rental car out of Maryland.

340
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:10,020
lD's fake. Credit card was stolen.
But that's our other kidnapper.

341
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,106
Does the car have a navigation
system? We could use the GPS.

342
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,984
Two words for you, McGee:
Lo and Jack.

343
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,402
That's one word.

344
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,156
- A what?
- lt's a-- Whatever.

345
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:24,451
l tracked it down to a parking lot
a couple miles from here.

346
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,287
Good job, McGee.

347
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,123
What?

348
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,292
Come on, let's roll.

349
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,002
Where's the child?

350
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,130
Now, keep your eye on the coin.

351
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:40,550
Yeah, like his.

352
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:45,430
Now that, my young friend,
is magic.

353
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:49,726
Now, a true magician doesn't reveal
the mysteries of his craft

354
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,645
to anyone else
but another magician.

355
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,148
But would you like to learn?

356
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,942
lt's in that hand.

357
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,153
lsn't it?

358
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,574
So it is.

359
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,702
He's quite observant.

360
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,664
Does he remind you of anyone?

361
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,001
Very good.

362
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,464
Got it, boss.
Black SUV, no rear window.

363
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:22,467
One visible suspect in the vehicle.

364
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:23,760
Should we take him now?

365
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,347
Wait. l'm almost in position here.

366
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,849
Copy.

367
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:37,357
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather be partner with McGee?

368
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:40,276
The two of you seem to click,
and we're about to storm this vehicle.

369
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:44,197
- Who knows what's gonna go down.
- Don't worry, Tony. l got your back.

370
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:48,034
My back. Listen, lady, if anybody
is getting anybody's back,

371
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,369
it's me getting yours.

372
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:50,870
ln position, DiNozzo.

373
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,999
Take him down.

374
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:23,669
- Ziva, what a pleasure.
- Dr. Mallard.

375
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,672
- Oh, Ducky, please.
- Ducky.

376
00:23:26,923 --> 00:23:28,883
Are you two done
with the name game?

377
00:23:29,092 --> 00:23:33,513
Yeah. Our guest departed this world
only a few hours ago.

378
00:23:34,097 --> 00:23:36,474
But he was in a great deal of pain
before he died.

379
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:38,142
Seems he was wounded.

380
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:41,187
Single round.
The bullet lodged under his scapula.

381
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:43,856
- The shoulder blade.
- Doc, l'm gonna guess

382
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:46,359
- that slug's from my safe.
- Yeah.

383
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:52,949
As to the fatal injury, this circular burn
around the entry wound suggests--

384
00:23:53,116 --> 00:23:54,492
A silencer was used.

385
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:57,412
lt was done in haste by someone
with little, if any, experience.

386
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,915
lf a professional did this,
he would have not left his weapon.

387
00:24:01,124 --> 00:24:02,875
lt's untidy. Marks of an amateur.

388
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,044
lf it were me,
l would have not been so obvious.

389
00:24:05,294 --> 00:24:08,381
There are literally dozens
of effective ways to eliminate a target

390
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:10,133
without raising suspicions.

391
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:14,804
Heroin overdose is popular,
but it requires a history of prior use.

392
00:24:15,013 --> 00:24:17,473
Of course, something like insulin
or potassium can be used

393
00:24:17,682 --> 00:24:20,727
to suggest death by natural causes.

394
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:25,440
l really must ask you over for dinner.
Mother would love to talk with you.

395
00:24:25,648 --> 00:24:28,359
They cleaned house. l wounded him
when he tried to grab Zach.

396
00:24:28,526 --> 00:24:29,986
After that he was a liability.

397
00:24:30,153 --> 00:24:32,864
Once again, l suggest
Commander Tanner may be involved.

398
00:24:33,031 --> 00:24:34,991
All the evidence says
he stole the software.

399
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:37,535
He cleared out his bank accounts.

400
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:40,455
He likely killed this man.

401
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:42,331
From an investigator's point of view,

402
00:24:42,498 --> 00:24:46,753
the pieces fit together quite well.

403
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,551
Or not.

404
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:57,263
- Abby.
- Ballistics lab, sir.

405
00:24:57,513 --> 00:24:59,265
- Serving in the military?
- No, sir, l was--

406
00:24:59,474 --> 00:25:02,018
- Stop standing at attention.
- lt's good posture, sir.

407
00:25:02,185 --> 00:25:05,730
- What? No Zachster?
- Abby, you're yelling.

408
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:08,775
- Oh, sorry. Where is he?
- He's upstairs.

409
00:25:08,983 --> 00:25:13,363
He's a cool kid. Reminds me of you.
He's like a mini-Gibbs.

410
00:25:13,571 --> 00:25:16,532
- Austin Powers?
- You calling Zach a Mini-Me?

411
00:25:16,699 --> 00:25:19,285
Gibbs, l am so impressed
with your pop-culture reference.

412
00:25:19,494 --> 00:25:20,703
Tell me about the weapon.

413
00:25:20,912 --> 00:25:22,205
All right. lt's a Makarov .380.

414
00:25:22,413 --> 00:25:25,208
lt matches the hollow point slugs
from the body downstairs.

415
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:28,628
And this bad boy that we pulled
from his shoulder matches your SlG.

416
00:25:28,878 --> 00:25:30,546
- Any prints from the .380?
- Dead guy's.

417
00:25:30,755 --> 00:25:32,131
- You have something else?
- l have.

418
00:25:32,382 --> 00:25:33,424
- What?
- Chip shaved.

419
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,510
l didn't notice.

420
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:38,137
He didn't notice?

421
00:25:38,388 --> 00:25:40,598
He doesn't notice
unimportant things, Chip.

422
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:47,313
Sorry, Chip. Didn't mean it.

423
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:58,658
- You getting off, director?
- Looking for you actually.

424
00:26:02,745 --> 00:26:05,331
l saw Ducky's report
on the body downstairs.

425
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:08,584
- That was fast.
- One of the perks of being director.

426
00:26:08,793 --> 00:26:10,586
l get to read all the good reports.

427
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:13,297
What's next, Jethro?

428
00:26:15,591 --> 00:26:18,177
Finishing this conversation.

429
00:26:18,428 --> 00:26:20,972
- Don't give me a hard time.
- l didn't realize l was.

430
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:24,475
The man who supposedly kidnapped
Commander Tanner

431
00:26:24,642 --> 00:26:26,352
is lying dead in our autopsy room.

432
00:26:26,602 --> 00:26:30,314
Tanner is looking
less and less like a victim.

433
00:26:30,523 --> 00:26:33,276
You want back in the field again,
Jen?

434
00:26:34,152 --> 00:26:35,445
Tanner has technology

435
00:26:35,611 --> 00:26:38,197
that could set back
our intelligence monitoring 30 years.

436
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:39,782
Pardon me for taking an interest.

437
00:26:39,991 --> 00:26:43,995
And here l thought you just wanted
an excuse to spend time together.

438
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:48,499
l just want to know that this is about
more than a fatherless child to you.

439
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:49,834
Boss.

440
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:53,296
Didn't you notice we're in the middle
of a conversation, Agent McGee?

441
00:26:53,504 --> 00:26:55,048
Sorry. Should l come back?

442
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:56,883
- No.
- Yes.

443
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:01,554
l'm simply trying to solve
your case here, director.

444
00:27:02,847 --> 00:27:03,890
Speak.

445
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:06,893
Commander Wilder is here.

446
00:27:07,101 --> 00:27:08,978
He works with Commander Tanner
at Q and R.

447
00:27:17,362 --> 00:27:19,197
Commander Wilder.

448
00:27:20,031 --> 00:27:22,158
l went by his house
to grab some stuff for him.

449
00:27:22,325 --> 00:27:26,245
Your agents wouldn't let me in, so
l bought him a Nintendo to play with.

450
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:28,915
That's the DS.
lt's an excellent system.

451
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,335
l've heard.

452
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:36,547
This is a hell of a situation.

453
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:39,133
Zach's been through so much
in his life already.

454
00:27:39,717 --> 00:27:41,219
ls there a reason you wanted
to see me?

455
00:27:41,594 --> 00:27:44,722
Tanner is a close friend.
l was hoping for information.

456
00:27:44,889 --> 00:27:46,683
At Q and R,
they're saying he's a suspect.

457
00:27:47,225 --> 00:27:49,560
Do you know the sacrifices he's made
to serve our country?

458
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:51,270
l do.

459
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:53,398
l don't care
what the computer log says.

460
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:55,358
Commander Tanner is no traitor.

461
00:27:55,566 --> 00:27:57,777
- What's it gonna take to prove that?
- Finding who is.

462
00:27:57,944 --> 00:28:00,530
Then you should look
at Q and R's civilian employees.

463
00:28:00,738 --> 00:28:03,908
They're falling all over themselves
to try and protect their collective asses.

464
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,662
What about Zach,
where's he staying?

465
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,955
With me.

466
00:28:09,163 --> 00:28:12,083
l'm the closest thing he has to family.
l can take him home with me.

467
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:15,128
Can't do that.
He's under protective custody.

468
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:17,672
You mean they're after Zach too?

469
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,924
We'll take good care of him,
commander.

470
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,969
l'm just gonna say goodbye.

471
00:28:27,765 --> 00:28:30,643
Boss, so did you tell him
we think Tanner's innocent?

472
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,104
We don't know he is.

473
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:35,773
Do you have something to say,
McGee?

474
00:28:37,692 --> 00:28:40,570
l've been going through the evidence
we bagged from the vehicle.

475
00:28:40,737 --> 00:28:44,824
Prepaid burn phone. Guess
whose number's on the caller lD.

476
00:28:44,991 --> 00:28:48,453
Frank Connell, Q and R office.

477
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,250
- What the hell are you doing in here?
- l couldn't stop them.

478
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:57,587
lt's not her fault.
She's overwhelmed by search warrant.

479
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:01,007
This is out of line.
l've been cooperative.

480
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:04,302
Explain why you called the kidnappers
from this office

481
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,928
the day the Honor code
went missing.

482
00:29:06,137 --> 00:29:08,681
- That's a ridiculous accusation.
- Denying you were here?

483
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:11,017
l said in my statement
l was working late that night.

484
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:12,977
So you made the call.

485
00:29:13,603 --> 00:29:15,521
Someone's tampered
with this hard drive.

486
00:29:15,772 --> 00:29:18,024
Tried to erase the command logs
morning of the robbery.

487
00:29:18,274 --> 00:29:20,860
We had a virus.
lt corrupted thousands of files.

488
00:29:21,027 --> 00:29:23,529
- ls that what happened?
- Can't tell until we get to the lab.

489
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,240
Okay, bag and tag.

490
00:29:26,449 --> 00:29:29,369
You cannot remove that computer
from this building.

491
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:32,872
- Don't worry. You're going with it.
- Go up and call the lawyers.

492
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:35,166
You have the right to remain silent.

493
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,960
Anything you say can and will
be used against you.

494
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:39,253
Hey.

495
00:29:39,462 --> 00:29:41,714
- Gibbs got Connell talking?
- His lawyer won't let him,

496
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:44,759
so Gibbs is giving him the old stare.

497
00:29:46,177 --> 00:29:47,762
Gibbs does it much better.

498
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,389
- Apple for teacher?
- For McGee.

499
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:52,517
He's been very generous with me.
Helping me adjust to this new city.

500
00:29:52,725 --> 00:29:54,143
So you're giving him an apple?

501
00:29:54,352 --> 00:29:56,062
lt's a small gesture.

502
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,398
lf you wanna thank him,
why don't you get him a date?

503
00:29:58,648 --> 00:30:01,734
Gibbs wants to know if you've got
anything he can use on Connell.

504
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:03,569
Frank Connell's a deacon
at his church.

505
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,155
Never had a moving violation,
let alone a parking ticket.

506
00:30:06,322 --> 00:30:08,866
He calls his mother every Sunday.
The man is spick-and-spam.

507
00:30:10,535 --> 00:30:13,996
The saying is spick-and-span.
Spam is lunch meat.

508
00:30:14,706 --> 00:30:17,917
- What exactly is span, then?
- Span is--

509
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,712
l'll get back to you on that.

510
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,714
ln my opinion,
Frank Connell's not involved.

511
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:27,385
Good. l'll let Gibbs know right away
because he loves to hear our opinions.

512
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:29,220
He's distracted by his affections.

513
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:32,682
- Gibbs doesn't get distracted.
- What do you call it, then?

514
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,351
The boss moves in mysterious ways.
Get this to him.

515
00:30:36,853 --> 00:30:39,564
- Why me?
- l'm gonna go see your buddy McGee.

516
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:43,276
- Hey, put that back.
- l'm just bringing it to him.

517
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:52,452
Progress report, McGee.

518
00:30:53,745 --> 00:30:56,873
l think that Frank Connell put a trace
on Commander Tanner's computer.

519
00:30:57,081 --> 00:30:58,458
- Think?
- Well,

520
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:00,710
l've got scraps of code,
protocols, commands.

521
00:31:00,918 --> 00:31:04,130
He might have put the trace in,
collected Tanner's passwords,

522
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,548
stolen the software.

523
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:09,093
''Might have'' and ''think''
are not going to make Gibbs happy.

524
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:12,722
Whoever wiped his files did a good job.
There is nothing left but fragments.

525
00:31:13,264 --> 00:31:15,475
Can't Gibbs just bring Connell
in interrogation?

526
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:18,353
Not with a $500-an-hour defence
attorney breathing down his neck.

527
00:31:18,561 --> 00:31:19,729
Puts it on you, McGee.

528
00:31:19,937 --> 00:31:22,148
Nothing l have found contradicts
any of the evidence

529
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:24,609
we have against Commander Tanner.

530
00:31:25,568 --> 00:31:28,613
l'm with you, probie. But he's feeling
pretty strong about this one.

531
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:32,742
Has anyone considered the fact
that Gibbs may be wrong this time?

532
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,161
McGee, bite your tongue.
Gibbs knows what he's doing.

533
00:31:35,411 --> 00:31:38,164
- We just have to show him love.
- We show the love, Abby.

534
00:31:38,956 --> 00:31:42,168
Just don't want to let the bad guys
get away while we're doing it.

535
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:45,922
Almost blocked my shot there,
Chipper.

536
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,341
- Ever play ball?
- College.

537
00:31:48,508 --> 00:31:50,677
Yeah? Me too.

538
00:31:50,885 --> 00:31:53,930
- Tony ran point for Ohio State.
- What conference did you play in?

539
00:31:54,138 --> 00:31:57,183
- We didn't exactly have a conference.
- Division?

540
00:31:57,392 --> 00:32:01,437
Not really.
lt was more of an intramural thing.

541
00:32:02,271 --> 00:32:04,482
Skins and moustaches?

542
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:08,361
What do you got for me?

543
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:11,197
Chip?

544
00:32:11,406 --> 00:32:12,990
Fingerprint analysis results.

545
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:20,623
- You're free to go, Chip.
- l don't mind staying late, ma'am.

546
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:23,876
Go home, Chip, please.

547
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:26,337
- ls that an order?
- Yes. Go.

548
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:34,846
l don't know how you concentrate
around him.

549
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:38,224
l know. No, no, no.

550
00:32:38,433 --> 00:32:41,060
No. l'm too good at what l do.

551
00:32:41,227 --> 00:32:43,813
No, you're not.

552
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:48,401
- l am. Gibbs is going to hate me for it.
- What happened?

553
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:50,236
l was following up
on the murder weapon.

554
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:52,488
- Double-check for anything l missed.
- Was there?

555
00:32:52,697 --> 00:32:54,824
- Fingerprints.
- On the gun?

556
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:57,160
- On the rounds in the magazine.
- That's great.

557
00:32:57,368 --> 00:32:59,579
Most people get obsessed
cleaning the grip and trigger.

558
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:01,664
They don't think twice
about the bullets.

559
00:33:01,873 --> 00:33:03,750
Now we've got a nice partial thumb,
a forefinger

560
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,210
- and a perfect index print.
- Amazing.

561
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:09,339
- Yeah, l know.
- So whose prints are they?

562
00:33:10,673 --> 00:33:12,175
Commander Tanner's.

563
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,728
Yeah.

564
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:28,273
Yeah. At this rate we'll have her
seaworthy in no time.

565
00:33:29,316 --> 00:33:32,778
Maybe my dad can help
when he gets back.

566
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:37,199
Hubba-hubba.

567
00:33:37,908 --> 00:33:39,409
Dinner at the White House?

568
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:40,994
A date, actually.

569
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:44,164
Must be an important guy for you
to get all decked out.

570
00:33:45,749 --> 00:33:48,835
l'd prefer if you just told me
that you liked my dress.

571
00:33:49,044 --> 00:33:51,088
l haven't decided yet.

572
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,926
Do you mind giving us a moment?

573
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:59,379
Zach, why don't you go upstairs
and grab a soda.

574
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:10,891
How long are you planning
on keeping Frank Connell locked up?

575
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:13,810
You make a house call
to reprimand me, Jen?

576
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:16,187
You got Commander Tanner's
fingerprints on the bullets

577
00:34:16,396 --> 00:34:18,899
- of the murder weapon.
- Well, l'm not sure he did it.

578
00:34:19,107 --> 00:34:22,903
Why? And don't tell me
your famous gut again.

579
00:34:25,155 --> 00:34:27,032
Zach is a great kid, Jethro.

580
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,159
Doesn't mean
his father's not a bastard.

581
00:34:29,993 --> 00:34:33,580
He might be,
but Zach's our only link to him.

582
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:36,041
He might make another attempt
to get Zach back?

583
00:34:36,249 --> 00:34:37,876
lf he does l'll be waiting for him.

584
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:39,794
My dad didn't do anything wrong.

585
00:34:43,298 --> 00:34:45,258
lt's a complicated situation.

586
00:34:45,467 --> 00:34:47,302
- lt's not.
- Zach.

587
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:50,722
Zach, there is evidence
he did something wrong.

588
00:34:50,931 --> 00:34:52,098
lt doesn't matter.

589
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:56,186
l know in my stomach
he didn't do anything wrong.

590
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:58,813
You promised
you'd bring him back to me, Gibbs.

591
00:34:59,022 --> 00:35:00,565
Please.

592
00:35:07,948 --> 00:35:10,367
- Where's Zach?
- Ducky's.

593
00:35:11,201 --> 00:35:15,997
Listen, l spent half the night taking
Frank Connell's hard drive apart.

594
00:35:16,206 --> 00:35:20,335
There's nothing. We need to accept
Commander Tanner sold the software.

595
00:35:20,544 --> 00:35:22,295
l'm not accepting anything.

596
00:35:23,296 --> 00:35:25,674
- Boss--
- Look at this a different way.

597
00:35:25,882 --> 00:35:27,801
l agree. l just talked to the ClA.

598
00:35:28,009 --> 00:35:29,302
They were very cooperative.

599
00:35:29,844 --> 00:35:31,972
- They were?
- He owed me a favour.

600
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,682
How many people owe you favours?

601
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,017
How many dates
does Tony go on a month?

602
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:39,854
This is from Kosovo
in the late '90s.

603
00:35:40,063 --> 00:35:41,898
The man with the shaved head
is Vincent Pazzo.

604
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:44,317
The one on the left is Willis Hirst.

605
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,612
They were mercenaries
for the Kosovo Liberation Army.

606
00:35:47,821 --> 00:35:49,656
- Freedom fighters.
- Not exactly.

607
00:35:49,864 --> 00:35:52,200
They worked for a warlord
as specialists.

608
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:56,121
- What specialty?
- Coercion.

609
00:35:56,705 --> 00:35:57,747
Torture.

610
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:01,918
But the evidence we have
against Commander Tanner?

611
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:05,130
This is a covert operation.
Take nothing at face value.

612
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:07,549
They framed Commander Tanner
as a diversion.

613
00:36:08,091 --> 00:36:09,926
While they torture him
for the access code.

614
00:36:10,594 --> 00:36:12,512
Maybe he won't talk.

615
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:14,890
Have you ever been tortured,
McGee?

616
00:36:15,098 --> 00:36:18,476
There's only so much torment
a human body can bear.

617
00:36:18,685 --> 00:36:21,104
Strong men break in a few days,
nobody holds out forever.

618
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:22,731
Not even
Gibbs.

619
00:36:22,939 --> 00:36:25,108
To a trained interrogator,
can be done in less time.

620
00:36:25,567 --> 00:36:27,068
l can get that code in hours.

621
00:36:28,612 --> 00:36:30,030
They've had him for two days.

622
00:36:30,238 --> 00:36:32,574
He's running out of time
if he hasn't talked already.

623
00:36:32,782 --> 00:36:34,159
A few hours, huh?

624
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:36,953
Give or take.

625
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:41,333
l'm putting you in a room with
Frank Connell, you have 40 minutes.

626
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:43,710
- l'd hold off on that, boss.
- Where have you been?

627
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:46,004
Tracking down the store
where our dead guy

628
00:36:46,213 --> 00:36:48,840
purchased his cell phone.
Not easy, by the way.

629
00:36:49,049 --> 00:36:52,719
The language barrier between me and
Mr. Singh was no piece of cake either.

630
00:36:52,886 --> 00:36:55,222
Once l convinced him l wasn't
going to shut down his store

631
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,432
he gave me his
surveillance video tapes.

632
00:36:58,058 --> 00:37:00,018
- ls this poppy seed?
- Where is the video?

633
00:37:00,227 --> 00:37:03,772
Abby's lab. Sorry, boss.
She's scanning the tapes now.

634
00:37:05,815 --> 00:37:07,400
The phone was purchased with cash,

635
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:09,653
a week before Commander Tanner
disappeared.

636
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:12,030
Pause the tape.

637
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,159
That woman's got four phones
in her hands.

638
00:37:16,785 --> 00:37:18,870
Zoom in, Abs.

639
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:25,168
Oh, yeah. The lips and the angle
of the chin, the curve of the neck.

640
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:27,921
Okay, we got it, Tony.
She's attractive.

641
00:37:28,129 --> 00:37:30,549
lt's Laura Osgood.
Frank Connell's assistant.

642
00:37:30,757 --> 00:37:32,676
l'll make you a print.

643
00:37:36,805 --> 00:37:38,765
l hate it when they do that.

644
00:37:47,607 --> 00:37:48,650
What's going on?

645
00:37:48,858 --> 00:37:52,112
You bought phones connected
to a robbery, kidnapping and murder.

646
00:37:54,864 --> 00:37:57,534
Her number matches several calls
on the kidnapper's phone.

647
00:37:58,326 --> 00:38:00,412
You're done.

648
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,123
Only way to help yourself
is tell us everything you know.

649
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:06,042
l want a lawyer.

650
00:38:14,134 --> 00:38:16,219
Commander Tanner's been gone
for 4 7 hours.

651
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:17,929
lf he's not dead yet,
he soon will be.

652
00:38:18,138 --> 00:38:20,765
Maybe we can convince her
to change her mind about the lawyer.

653
00:38:20,974 --> 00:38:22,517
l can convince her
far more than that.

654
00:38:22,726 --> 00:38:23,768
How long?

655
00:38:23,977 --> 00:38:25,228
Not long.

656
00:38:28,899 --> 00:38:30,400
McGee, are you thirsty?

657
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:33,403
Come on.
l'll buy you a cup of coffee.

658
00:38:48,877 --> 00:38:52,339
Boss, what exactly is Ziva
doing in there?

659
00:38:54,591 --> 00:38:56,301
l don't want to know.

660
00:38:58,428 --> 00:39:01,139
lt was a three-man team.

661
00:39:01,348 --> 00:39:03,808
l was on the inside.

662
00:39:04,017 --> 00:39:08,438
l put a trace on Commander Tanner's
computer to get his passwords.

663
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:11,441
l planted the virus using his log-in.

664
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,777
Keep going, Laura.

665
00:39:14,027 --> 00:39:18,031
Pazzo and Hirst grabbed Commander
Tanner to get the access code.

666
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,201
- Who set it up?
- l don't know.

667
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:25,288
We were contacted separately.

668
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:29,668
Money was wired. lnstructions
e-mailed on an anonymous server.

669
00:39:29,876 --> 00:39:31,503
Where is he?

670
00:39:33,046 --> 00:39:35,632
Commander Tanner,
where is he being tortured?

671
00:39:36,758 --> 00:39:39,427
That wasn't part of my assignment.

672
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,517
Please, they'll kill me.

673
00:39:47,769 --> 00:39:51,481
lt's a garage near Coleman Park.

674
00:40:03,785 --> 00:40:05,579
- Yeah?
- Code checks out.

675
00:40:05,787 --> 00:40:08,248
- Proceed as planned.
- All right. l'll go clean up.

676
00:40:39,821 --> 00:40:41,448
Clear.

677
00:40:43,283 --> 00:40:44,910
Commander Tanner.

678
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:49,623
- Zach?
- All right. He's safe. We've got him.

679
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:53,210
They told me they had him.

680
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:55,420
lf l didn't give them the code,
they'll kill him.

681
00:40:55,629 --> 00:40:58,006
- You gave them the key?
- l had to.

682
00:40:58,215 --> 00:41:02,302
They had my son.
They showed me proof.

683
00:41:02,469 --> 00:41:03,511
What proof?

684
00:41:15,565 --> 00:41:19,110
Agent Gibbs?
What in the hell's going on?

685
00:41:20,487 --> 00:41:22,572
l'm not resisting.

686
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:23,865
Too bad.

687
00:41:24,324 --> 00:41:27,702
l could have never hurt Zach.
lt was strictly business.

688
00:41:27,911 --> 00:41:29,371
We'll be sure to let him know that.

689
00:41:54,938 --> 00:41:56,523
Are you okay?

690
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:58,483
l guess.

691
00:41:59,401 --> 00:42:02,779
Commander Wilder was my dad's...

692
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:05,699
He was my friend, Gibbs.

693
00:42:07,868 --> 00:42:10,120
l should have known.

694
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:14,207
l shouldn't have let him
fool me like that.

695
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:18,378
Zach, sometimes really bad people

696
00:42:19,045 --> 00:42:21,256
are good at fooling you.

697
00:42:21,798 --> 00:42:25,093
Anybody bad ever fool you?

698
00:42:25,302 --> 00:42:27,762
Oh, yeah. More than once.

699
00:42:31,433 --> 00:42:35,478
Someday l'm going to find them
and put them all in jail.

700
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:38,273
l believe you will.

701
00:42:39,065 --> 00:42:40,191
Zach.

702
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,653
Dad. Daddy. Daddy.

703
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:45,530
You're all right.

704
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:47,449
l knew you'd never leave me.

705
00:42:47,657 --> 00:42:51,077
- l'm all right. Everything's all right.
- l love you, Daddy.
