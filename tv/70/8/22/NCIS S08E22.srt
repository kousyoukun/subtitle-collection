1
00:00:40,855 --> 00:00:42,890
Like that.
All these knives?

2
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,792
Yep. This is what I told
you. Am I right, or what?

3
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,127
You are correct.

4
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:49,635
100 knives at this price
is an unbelievable deal.

5
00:00:49,703 --> 00:00:52,272
Now, listen, you'd pay more
than twice this amount

6
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,710
if you bought these exact
knives in a store.

7
00:00:54,778 --> 00:00:58,282
This deal can't be beat.

8
00:01:08,029 --> 00:01:11,131
No, no.

11
00:02:32,258 --> 00:02:34,093
Hey, guys!

12
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:36,095
Tell me you've seen it.

13
00:02:36,163 --> 00:02:37,864
And good morning
to you, too, Tony.

14
00:02:37,932 --> 00:02:40,100
Actually it's the worst morning
in the history of mornings.

15
00:02:40,168 --> 00:02:42,203
My phone!
Tell me you've seen it.

16
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,539
Lost your cell, huh? Ouch.

17
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:47,143
Well, you are a very
capable investigator.

18
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,711
Why don't you just investigate.

19
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:51,047
Yes.

20
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:04,597
Uh, Tony is just...
I don't want to know.

21
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:06,766
McGee,

22
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:08,702
did you write this?

23
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:11,004
I did.
Why, is something wrong?

24
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,807
"Retinal scanner uses

25
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,876
wavefront-sensing
reflection points..."

26
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:17,511
Yeah.

27
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:20,247
"...correlates the data using
a point spread function..."

28
00:03:20,315 --> 00:03:23,851
Yeah. "...rasterizes the
pupil conjugate-geometry."

29
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,252
Was I too technical?

30
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:33,327
Well, uh...
it's pretty straightforward.

31
00:03:33,395 --> 00:03:35,397
The eyeball from
the Port-to-Port Killer

32
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:37,399
unlocked MTAC's
retinal scanner.

33
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:39,334
Yes, I know that, McGee.

34
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:41,403
Well, Agent Barrett
and her team did find

35
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,474
the eye's retinal pattern
in MTAC's Access Directory,

36
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,110
but the name attached is
marked "classified." By who?

37
00:03:47,177 --> 00:03:48,545
Uh, don't know.

38
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:50,981
And they searched every entry
log in the entire system.

39
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:52,349
It's an extra eyeball.

40
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:55,052
But it's been put on
the back burner for now.

41
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,620
Agent Barrett and her team
left for Hawaii last night,

42
00:03:56,688 --> 00:03:58,355
following a new lead.

43
00:03:58,423 --> 00:03:59,823
I can keep checking
other avenues if you want.

44
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:00,825
I want!

45
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:03,728
DiNozzo.

46
00:04:03,795 --> 00:04:05,596
What the hell
are you doing?

47
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:07,498
I lost my phone.
You haven't seen it?

48
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:12,403
Use mine.

49
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:14,671
Wow, that's heavy.

50
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:16,139
I need something
with a computer on it

51
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:18,509
so I can program ringtones.
Otherwise I don't...

52
00:04:18,577 --> 00:04:20,211
'Cause I have a... It's ringing.

53
00:04:23,215 --> 00:04:25,115
Answer it.

54
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:27,951
Special Agent Gibbs' desk.

55
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,653
This is Very Special Agent
Anthony DiNo...

56
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:30,854
Oh, hey.

57
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:32,589
Where? Okay.

58
00:04:32,657 --> 00:04:34,258
Dead guy. Navy Lodge.

59
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:35,893
Let's go.

60
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:36,960
Here you go.

61
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:41,465
That's very nice of you,
but I'm good.

62
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:46,838
Looks like
the Port-to-Port Killer

63
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:48,706
is back on the front burner.

64
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:51,208
Duck? DUCKY: Agent McGee,

65
00:04:51,276 --> 00:04:52,910
if you would be so kind.

66
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:54,578
Should I call
Agent Barrett?

67
00:04:56,615 --> 00:04:59,216
Nope.
But this is her...

68
00:04:59,284 --> 00:05:01,418
loss for not
being in town.

69
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:02,887
We don't even know what we're
looking at yet, DiNozzo.

70
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:05,356
I know what we're
<i>not</i> looking at.

71
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:07,759
At his age, there's no way
this guy's a three-star admiral.

72
00:05:07,827 --> 00:05:09,494
Yeah, well...

73
00:05:09,562 --> 00:05:13,198
the Port-to-Port Killer
is fond of dressing his victims

74
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:15,166
in higher-ranking uniforms.

75
00:05:15,234 --> 00:05:18,237
Uh, there's the usual lack
of defensive wounds.

76
00:05:18,305 --> 00:05:19,505
Not a drop of blood.

77
00:05:19,573 --> 00:05:23,876
And the expected
enigmatic clue.

78
00:05:23,944 --> 00:05:25,745
In this case...
A fortune cookie.

79
00:05:25,812 --> 00:05:27,046
Can't wait to crack that open.

80
00:05:27,113 --> 00:05:29,081
You got a time of death, Duck?
Well,

81
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:31,350
the body's already reached
ambient temperature.

82
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:33,118
But from his skin color,
well it...

83
00:05:33,186 --> 00:05:35,420
tells me that
not more than 12 hours.

84
00:05:35,488 --> 00:05:37,857
That's right around the time
Agent Barrett left for Hawaii.

85
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:40,192
It's almost like the killer was
waiting for her to leave town.

86
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,828
And for the grand finale...

87
00:05:48,201 --> 00:05:50,203
...a six-centimeter cut,

88
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,239
ear to ear,
severing the carotid artery.

89
00:05:53,307 --> 00:05:55,442
Our killer is nothing
if not consistent.

90
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,543
Is there anything wrong, Tony?

91
00:05:56,611 --> 00:05:58,979
Yeah. I know him.

92
00:05:59,047 --> 00:06:00,815
Who is he?

93
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,885
He's my old partner.

94
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:15,734
I imagine you and Anthony
were quite close.

95
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:19,071
And as partners, your very lives
depended on your

96
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:20,772
trust in one another.

97
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,642
Yeah, I'd hate to be
in your killer's shoes

98
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,911
when Anthony's
catch up with him.

99
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:27,179
What do you got, Duck.

100
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:29,215
Well, the same
type of blade

101
00:06:29,283 --> 00:06:31,885
as the prior murders
was used on his neck.

102
00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:33,153
Again, the body has been
scrubbed vigorously,

103
00:06:33,221 --> 00:06:35,923
and the characteristic manicure.

104
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,191
Any differences?

105
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:40,428
Yeah, this body was sedated
prior to his death.

106
00:06:40,496 --> 00:06:42,730
But the most notable
difference is the

107
00:06:42,798 --> 00:06:45,065
choice of victims.

108
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:46,767
Anthony knows this one.

109
00:06:46,835 --> 00:06:48,635
As to the significance of that,

110
00:06:48,703 --> 00:06:50,237
perhaps if I knew
more about him...

111
00:06:50,305 --> 00:06:52,705
Uh...

112
00:06:52,773 --> 00:06:54,274
We worked homicide
in Baltimore together.

113
00:06:54,341 --> 00:06:55,608
So you said.

114
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:57,510
Did he have any Naval
experience?

115
00:06:57,577 --> 00:06:59,378
He was a reservist

116
00:06:59,445 --> 00:07:00,746
before he joined the force.

117
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:04,015
I suppose it is possible
that Anthony's relation

118
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:07,185
to him is, uh,
merely coincidental.

119
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:08,586
You want to bet, Duck?

120
00:07:08,653 --> 00:07:10,388
Nothing I'd care to lose.

121
00:07:10,455 --> 00:07:11,822
Anything else?

122
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:16,493
Yeah, all of the prior victims
were in perfect health.

123
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,529
But this one suffered
from a severe

124
00:07:18,597 --> 00:07:20,464
alcohol-induced cirrhosis.

125
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:24,001
He must've had...
quite a drinking problem.

126
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:28,405
Not when I knew him, but, uh...

127
00:07:28,473 --> 00:07:30,407
a few years
after I left for NCIS,

128
00:07:30,475 --> 00:07:32,075
I know that...

129
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:34,444
he was asked to retire.

130
00:07:34,512 --> 00:07:36,146
I see.
Yeah, um...

131
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:38,949
Came from money, not that
he ever saw much of it.

132
00:07:39,017 --> 00:07:41,452
His dad... wasn't around much

133
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,753
and his mom died
when he was a kid.

134
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:44,855
So you and he had
quite a lot in common.

135
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,959
I'm surprised I never heard
you mention him.

136
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:49,694
Well, you know how it is.

137
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:53,865
You lose touch,
time goes by.

138
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:56,168
Too much time, in this case.

139
00:07:56,236 --> 00:07:59,873
And when it's gone,
you can never get it back.

140
00:08:05,446 --> 00:08:08,714
What do you think, huh?
Oh... that looks painful.

141
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:11,016
It's very
Robert Mitchum, 1955.

142
00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:12,150
<i>Night of the Hunter.</i>

143
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:13,585
Does it really go
with the suit, though?

144
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:15,386
Oh, it's-it's Nino Cerruti.

145
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,188
Cerruti.
And forgive me if I don't

146
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:18,923
take fashion advice from a man
who still wears tube socks.

147
00:08:18,991 --> 00:08:20,391
What's the matter
with tube socks?

148
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,192
They're very comfortable,
and they give me traction.

149
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,061
For what?
Get off of me!

150
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:31,503
Yeesh. Ow.

151
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:32,637
All right, get up!

152
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:34,540
Come on, let's go.
Let go. Ah!

153
00:08:34,608 --> 00:08:36,275
Move it!

154
00:08:36,343 --> 00:08:37,576
You didn't need
tube socks for that.

155
00:08:37,644 --> 00:08:40,212
A little help.

156
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:42,782
Thanks.

157
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:45,017
Everybody, I just want you to
know I'm a little disappointed.

158
00:08:45,085 --> 00:08:47,386
PCP addicts are Friday night.
It's Saturday night,

159
00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:49,087
which is hooker night.
Where are the hookers?

160
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:50,989
Hey, Tony.
Ho!

161
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:53,691
I mean, the call girls.
Hi, Sapphire.

162
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,860
When's the big day?
Uh, it's...

163
00:08:55,927 --> 00:08:57,127
Thanks for those
Christmas decorations.

164
00:08:57,195 --> 00:08:58,629
No problem, baby.

165
00:08:58,697 --> 00:08:59,930
All right, all right.

166
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,765
Now if you kiddies
have had your fun,

167
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,800
we got some business.

168
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:04,234
First up,
we finished the tally

169
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:06,237
and we got this year's winner

170
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:07,971
of the Station House
Pool Championship.

171
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,540
Let me guess.

172
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:11,075
That would be me?

173
00:09:11,143 --> 00:09:12,878
As a matter of fact
it is, Anthony.

174
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:13,945
Thank you very much.

175
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:17,149
Thank you. Thank you, Major.

176
00:09:17,216 --> 00:09:19,418
It is my second year in a row,
and-and it's, uh, a great honor.

177
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:20,753
You're my Lombardi.

178
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,488
I thank you.
Enjoy.

179
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:24,290
Wow. A stapler.

180
00:09:24,358 --> 00:09:25,657
What-what is that?

181
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:27,459
Mighty Mouse.

182
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:29,127
Mighty Mouse?
Found it at a garage sale.

183
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,062
All I can afford on my salary.

184
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,997
Very sweet of you, sir.
Yeah, don't mention it.

185
00:09:33,065 --> 00:09:34,232
Second order
of business:

186
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:36,467
who's got the, uh,
the Franklin homicide?

187
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,936
Oh, yeah, that's us.
I mean... Yeah.

188
00:09:39,004 --> 00:09:41,439
Good. Knock yourselves out.
Thank you, Major.

189
00:09:41,507 --> 00:09:42,840
What do we got?

190
00:09:42,908 --> 00:09:46,143
Ah. A hit on the prints we
found at the murder scene.

191
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,680
Joseph Manheim aka Joey Peanuts.

192
00:09:49,748 --> 00:09:51,015
Nice name.

193
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,783
You ever heard of him?
Nope.

194
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:55,586
I guess we should go
check him out.

195
00:09:55,654 --> 00:09:58,690
The Port-to-Port Killer didn't
leave us much to go on, Gibbs.

196
00:09:58,758 --> 00:10:01,193
He used the same antiseptic
to clean the body,

197
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,695
which we could never
trace back to him.

198
00:10:02,763 --> 00:10:04,497
He used the same
industrial plastic

199
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:06,866
to wrap the body, which...
It was a dead end, too.

200
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:08,134
Thanks for reminding me.

201
00:10:08,202 --> 00:10:10,770
I mean, everything
is the same.

202
00:10:10,838 --> 00:10:13,540
Right down to the knot he used
to tie his victims' feet.

203
00:10:13,608 --> 00:10:15,676
If this guy keeps walking
in his own footsteps,

204
00:10:15,744 --> 00:10:17,678
we're never gonna catch him.
He won't.

205
00:10:17,746 --> 00:10:19,447
He'll make a mistake.
They all do.

206
00:10:19,514 --> 00:10:21,516
Actually, I'm just wallowing
in my own self-pity.

207
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,985
He or she may have already
made a mistake.

208
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:26,220
I opened the fortune cookie,
and, shockingly,

209
00:10:26,288 --> 00:10:27,454
there was a fortune inside.

210
00:10:27,522 --> 00:10:29,023
You don't have to
strain, Gibbs.

211
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,925
I made you your very
own Gibbs version.

212
00:10:33,294 --> 00:10:36,196
"Keep your friends close
but your enemies closer."

213
00:10:36,263 --> 00:10:39,565
So, the company that made
this particular cookie

214
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:41,767
embeds its initials
in the side of the dough.

215
00:10:41,835 --> 00:10:45,171
The "DH" is probably embossed
on a cookie sheet. Who?

216
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:47,574
Um, the logo belongs to

217
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:50,377
Dao Huang Fortune Cookie
Company, in Baltimore.

218
00:10:50,444 --> 00:10:52,946
If the quote isn't random, Gibbs...
It wasn't.

219
00:10:53,014 --> 00:10:54,481
...then it had to be put

220
00:10:54,549 --> 00:10:56,517
inside the cookie
before it was folded.

221
00:10:56,585 --> 00:10:57,885
Otherwise, I would
be able to tell.

222
00:10:57,953 --> 00:10:59,087
Which means it was put there

223
00:10:59,155 --> 00:11:00,522
by someone who had
access to the kitchen.

224
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,456
That's nice work, Abbs.

225
00:11:01,524 --> 00:11:03,358
<i>Xie xie,</i> Gibbs.

226
00:11:03,426 --> 00:11:06,628
But if the quote isn't random,
then what does that mean?

227
00:11:06,695 --> 00:11:08,263
Nothing good.

228
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,965
What if the killer's trying to
tell us he's gonna come after

229
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:12,066
our friends?

230
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:13,567
I mean, Tony
knew the victim.

231
00:11:13,635 --> 00:11:14,735
Not just Tony.

232
00:11:14,803 --> 00:11:16,169
I knew him, too.

233
00:11:16,237 --> 00:11:18,404
MAN
Welcome back, Baltimore,

234
00:11:18,472 --> 00:11:20,073
to the Johnny
and Rex show.

235
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,509
MAN 2: So let's continue our
discussion on Cal Ripken, Jr.,

236
00:11:23,577 --> 00:11:25,211
baseball's
new retired Ironman.

237
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:26,746
Let's do it.
All right, so, Rex,

238
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:28,581
does Cal get into
the Hall of Fame

239
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:30,550
on his streak
or on his stats?

240
00:11:30,618 --> 00:11:32,285
Are you serious?
Is that a real question?

241
00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:33,954
Streak or no streak,
Cal Ripken, Jr. goes into...

242
00:11:35,323 --> 00:11:36,589
Whoo!
What's the deal?

243
00:11:36,657 --> 00:11:38,124
It's been three hours.

244
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:41,160
He says Joey Peanuts will show.

245
00:11:41,227 --> 00:11:42,494
He's got some kind of meet.

246
00:11:44,697 --> 00:11:46,764
You ate all my moo shu.

247
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,699
I didn't see your name on it.

248
00:11:49,902 --> 00:11:51,436
Oh. Hey, look.

249
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:52,970
I think this is for you.

250
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,008
"Love is for the lucky
and the brave."

251
00:11:58,076 --> 00:11:59,343
Why is that for me?

252
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,745
Hey, man, asking your high
school music teacher out

253
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:03,446
qualifies as
brave in my book.

254
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,083
Wendy asked me out, remember?

255
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,352
See, that's why you
can dress like that.

256
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,587
'Cause you're
good-looking.

257
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:13,358
But one of these days, the
looks are gonna run out.

258
00:12:13,426 --> 00:12:16,028
I plan to be safely married
by then, Danny.

259
00:12:16,096 --> 00:12:19,165
Well, if not, you might want
to consider a new wardrobe.

260
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:20,767
Seriously.

261
00:12:20,835 --> 00:12:23,437
Yeah, with the right clothes,
you'd be unstoppable.

262
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:24,671
What's that supposed to mean?

263
00:12:27,675 --> 00:12:28,909
There's our boy.

264
00:12:28,977 --> 00:12:31,145
Joey Peanuts.

265
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:33,414
You dress like my father.

266
00:12:33,481 --> 00:12:34,681
Let's go.

267
00:12:48,563 --> 00:12:49,997
Crap. I got him!

268
00:12:50,065 --> 00:12:51,599
Stop! Baltimore PD!

269
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,167
Freeze, dirtbag!

270
00:12:53,268 --> 00:12:56,503
You can't outrun me;
I'm wearing tube socks!

271
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:06,514
I said freeze, dirtbag!

272
00:13:15,108 --> 00:13:16,575
Look, I'm just
saying that I think

273
00:13:16,643 --> 00:13:18,310
Tony is more upset
than he's letting on.

274
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:20,679
Yes, but he and his partner
had not spoken in years.

275
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:22,814
Okay, let's say you and
I hadn't spoken in years,

276
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:24,950
and I get my throat slit
by a serial killer.

277
00:13:25,018 --> 00:13:26,218
I would hunt him down

278
00:13:26,286 --> 00:13:28,520
and make him regret
the day he was born.

279
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:30,256
You're not just
any partner, McGee.

280
00:13:30,323 --> 00:13:31,590
Neither is Tony.

281
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:33,893
Dao Huang.

282
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,261
All right.

283
00:13:42,702 --> 00:13:44,769
Can I help you?

284
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:48,206
Yes. I'm Agent McGee
from NCIS.

285
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:49,641
And this is my partner

286
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:50,909
Agent David.

287
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:52,244
We're looking
for Dao Huang.

288
00:13:52,312 --> 00:13:53,879
Well, you found him.

289
00:13:55,215 --> 00:13:57,250
Your name is Dao Huang?

290
00:13:58,285 --> 00:14:00,887
Try looking at a map
sometimes, okay?

291
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:02,822
China is right next to Russia.

292
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,225
My parents emigrated
from Beijing.

293
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:08,396
I was adopted in Kiev,
we moved to D.C.

294
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:09,764
Bing!
Okay.

295
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:12,767
Is it any stranger than an
American with an Irish name?

296
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:14,403
Have you ever been to Ireland?

297
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,537
I-I have not.

298
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,773
That's a very good point.
I'm sorry.

299
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:19,975
Listen, we just need to ask you
a few questions.

300
00:14:20,043 --> 00:14:22,111
Uh, can you identify these?

301
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,650
Looks like one of mine.

302
00:14:27,718 --> 00:14:30,153
Has my logo.

303
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,153
You see?

304
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:32,588
I bake it in.

305
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,525
But the coloring
is wrong.

306
00:14:36,593 --> 00:14:39,094
And that is not
one of my sayings.

307
00:14:39,162 --> 00:14:40,763
That cookie is a forgery.

308
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:42,498
Do you have any employees
that might've made it?

309
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:43,699
No.

310
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:45,534
I do all the
printing myself.

311
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:50,104
Where'd you get this cookie?

312
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:51,539
We found it
at a crime scene.

313
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:53,541
Hmm. Could've
been made

314
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:55,743
from one of the trays
taken in the robbery.

315
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,411
Robbery?

316
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,779
Yeah, five
weeks ago.

317
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:02,783
Someone broke in and took
my safe and some equipment.

318
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:04,953
This business can be
quite cutthroat.

319
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,287
Most people don't know that.

320
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:08,056
Do the police have any suspects?

321
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:09,924
They took a report,

322
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,694
some evidence, and they ate
a half a case of cookies.

323
00:15:13,762 --> 00:15:16,865
I'm not
expecting much.

324
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:19,434
Well, maybe we can take
a second look for you.

325
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,437
Thanks.

326
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,741
Well, it's confirmed,
he's a cop.

327
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:27,343
A Navy cop.

328
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:30,914
Special Agent
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

329
00:15:30,982 --> 00:15:32,483
Oops.

330
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,851
We're sorry.

331
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,987
Maybe next time, you'll remember
your identification.

332
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:39,624
You don't do a lot of
undercover work, do you?

333
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:41,426
Do you?
You just got arrested.

334
00:15:41,493 --> 00:15:43,261
I let you arrest me.

335
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:44,529
Let?

336
00:15:44,597 --> 00:15:45,931
Who you kidding?

337
00:15:45,998 --> 00:15:48,099
I chased you half a
block, and I had you

338
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:49,434
like a gazelle
on the Serengeti.

339
00:15:49,502 --> 00:15:50,435
Am I wrong?

340
00:15:50,503 --> 00:15:51,603
No.
No.

341
00:15:51,671 --> 00:15:53,238
So what am I supposed
to call you,

342
00:15:53,306 --> 00:15:54,539
Special Agent, uh,

343
00:15:54,607 --> 00:15:56,508
Leroy?

344
00:15:58,043 --> 00:15:58,943
Mm-mm?

345
00:15:59,011 --> 00:16:00,611
Jethro?

346
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:02,380
Jethro? Mm.

347
00:16:02,447 --> 00:16:03,714
That's a little
<i>Beverly Hillbillies.</i>

348
00:16:03,782 --> 00:16:06,083
Gibbs it is,
I guess.

349
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:07,718
All right.

350
00:16:07,785 --> 00:16:09,019
We're working
a homicide.

351
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:11,321
Joey Peanuts left his
prints at the scene.

352
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:12,956
We think
he's our guy.

353
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:15,258
What's your beef with him?

354
00:16:15,326 --> 00:16:17,827
Got a tip someone was using
a Navy payroll office

355
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:18,961
to launder money.

356
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:20,964
Haven't I.D.'d him yet, but...

357
00:16:21,032 --> 00:16:22,265
You think Joey
works for him.

358
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,300
That's right.

359
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:24,634
As what, some
kind of courier?

360
00:16:24,702 --> 00:16:26,135
That's right.

361
00:16:26,203 --> 00:16:27,403
So you put on
a funny hat,

362
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:29,272
fill a briefcase
with some cash,

363
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:32,108
give Joey the dirty dough,
he gives it to his boss,

364
00:16:32,176 --> 00:16:33,977
you follow the trail
and make the bust?

365
00:16:34,045 --> 00:16:36,080
That was the plan.

366
00:16:37,315 --> 00:16:38,749
Until you screwed it up.

367
00:16:38,817 --> 00:16:40,518
Me?

368
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:42,253
Listen here.

369
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:44,388
You're the one that didn't
tell the department

370
00:16:44,456 --> 00:16:48,026
that your, uh,
NCIS was running an op.

371
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:49,161
Or read our dispatch.

372
00:16:49,229 --> 00:16:51,096
We had a BOLO out on Joey
for two days.

373
00:16:51,164 --> 00:16:52,798
Yeah, I know.

374
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:55,502
You knew?

375
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,036
Well, then what the
hell were you doing,

376
00:16:57,104 --> 00:16:58,871
running around,
risking...

377
00:17:02,642 --> 00:17:04,577
Really?

378
00:17:05,612 --> 00:17:08,213
You wanted to
get arrested.

379
00:17:08,281 --> 00:17:09,948
We didn't screw
anything up for him.

380
00:17:10,016 --> 00:17:11,516
You're a new face
on the street.

381
00:17:11,584 --> 00:17:15,119
What's the best way to earn
instant bona fides then, uh,

382
00:17:15,187 --> 00:17:17,355
getting pinched?

383
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:20,792
Navy Guy.

384
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,894
I don't like
getting played.

385
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:25,898
Having said that,
well played.

386
00:17:25,966 --> 00:17:27,033
Very <i>Donnie Brasco,</i>
actually.

387
00:17:27,101 --> 00:17:28,534
Yeah, but w-we're done
with games.

388
00:17:28,602 --> 00:17:30,603
Joey's our witness;
we're interrogating him.

389
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:31,738
I know.

390
00:17:31,805 --> 00:17:33,806
I'm undercover, remember?

391
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:38,311
The break-in at the
bakery was five weeks ago.

392
00:17:38,379 --> 00:17:39,646
The thief kicked in a door.

393
00:17:39,714 --> 00:17:40,714
Took off with the safe.

394
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:42,416
Other than that, nothing.

395
00:17:42,483 --> 00:17:44,151
No fingerprints,
no footprints.

396
00:17:44,219 --> 00:17:46,687
No physical evidence at all.

397
00:17:46,754 --> 00:17:48,021
That's the
Port-to-Port Killer's M.O.

398
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:49,989
You got witnesses?
Sort of.

399
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:52,859
Police report lists
a cracked-out junkie

400
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:56,862
says he saw a car
leaving the scene.

401
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,530
Where are my glasses?

402
00:17:58,598 --> 00:18:00,565
Didn't get plates,
just a make and model.

403
00:18:00,633 --> 00:18:01,800
Police didn't
put out a BOLO.

404
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:02,934
Didn't think it
was credible.

405
00:18:03,002 --> 00:18:04,669
McGee.
BOLO, got it.

406
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:07,505
Ziva. I will track the junkie,
see if I can get any more info.

407
00:18:07,573 --> 00:18:09,240
DiNozzo.

408
00:18:09,307 --> 00:18:10,808
Yeah?

409
00:18:12,844 --> 00:18:13,943
Talk to me.

410
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:15,211
About what?

411
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,846
Are you okay?

412
00:18:16,914 --> 00:18:17,914
I'm fine.

413
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,284
This has nothing
to do with that.

414
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:22,685
Ancient history.

415
00:18:22,753 --> 00:18:26,222
Yeah, I know, but that doesn't
make this any easier.

416
00:18:28,258 --> 00:18:31,194
I'm fine.

417
00:18:31,262 --> 00:18:33,129
I'm more worried
about Abby's theory

418
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:35,532
that the Port-to-Port Killer
is targeting our friends.

419
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,133
Can't protect
all of them.

420
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:39,969
We protect them
by catching the killer.

421
00:18:41,672 --> 00:18:44,173
Same as you did before.

422
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:53,416
Messy, huh?

423
00:18:53,483 --> 00:18:56,485
I don't know
nothing about that.

424
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:57,887
Didn't say
that you did.

425
00:18:57,954 --> 00:18:59,321
But you do.

426
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,856
I don't even
know the guy.

427
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:04,560
Well,

428
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:06,195
it's possible we screwed up.

429
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,266
Are you 100% sure

430
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:11,934
you've never seen
this guy before?

431
00:19:12,002 --> 00:19:13,269
Yeah, yeah.

432
00:19:13,337 --> 00:19:14,504
100%.

433
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:16,939
We found your prints
at the crime scene.

434
00:19:17,007 --> 00:19:19,876
Which means if we can't
put you away for murder...

435
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:22,445
We got you on obstruction
of justice in a capital case.

436
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:23,913
What's the maximum
on that again?

437
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,581
I think it's,
like, 20 years, Joey.

438
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:26,983
Isn't it, isn't it 30?

439
00:19:27,051 --> 00:19:28,184
Yeah, I think it's 30.

440
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:30,786
Actually, yeah, know what,
we'll figure it out.

441
00:19:30,854 --> 00:19:32,188
Thanks for your time, Joey.

442
00:19:36,493 --> 00:19:37,960
Okay, okay.

443
00:19:38,028 --> 00:19:39,628
Okay. Wait.

444
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:41,530
I get it.
I get it.

445
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:45,868
Yeah, I was in his car,
but that was over a week ago.

446
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:49,405
You.

447
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:51,206
Here you go,
have a piece of gum.

448
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:52,174
Ah, come on.

449
00:19:52,242 --> 00:19:53,876
No, no, no, have
a piece. Come on.

450
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:55,111
Don't make me chew alone.

451
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:56,312
It'll make you feel better.

452
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,047
Gets the jaw moving.

453
00:19:58,115 --> 00:19:59,048
There you go.

454
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:01,350
It's wintry fresh.

455
00:20:03,354 --> 00:20:05,688
Now talk.

456
00:20:09,227 --> 00:20:13,463
I, um, I picked up a package
from this guy last week.

457
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:15,499
That's why you found
my prints, okay?

458
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:16,666
What was the package?

459
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:20,536
Chew.

460
00:20:22,106 --> 00:20:23,940
It was a duffel bag.

461
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:25,542
50 grand inside.

462
00:20:26,577 --> 00:20:28,245
Dirty money.

463
00:20:28,313 --> 00:20:30,280
Huh. And you were gonna
clean it for him?

464
00:20:30,348 --> 00:20:32,716
No! No, no, no.

465
00:20:33,785 --> 00:20:35,486
I'm just a
courier, okay?

466
00:20:35,553 --> 00:20:37,387
I pick up dirty
money from clients

467
00:20:37,455 --> 00:20:39,389
and I bring it to my boss.

468
00:20:39,457 --> 00:20:42,126
He... he does the laundering.

469
00:20:42,194 --> 00:20:45,029
I'm just trying to make a
few extra bucks while I...

470
00:20:45,097 --> 00:20:46,898
I take the real estate exam.

471
00:20:46,965 --> 00:20:48,599
You know?

472
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:49,901
We get it.

473
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:51,002
Joey, come on.

474
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,470
So, tell us,
what went wrong?

475
00:20:52,538 --> 00:20:53,705
I don't know.

476
00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:56,107
I don't know how my
boss finds these guys.

477
00:20:56,175 --> 00:20:58,176
Franklin was
an amateur.

478
00:20:58,244 --> 00:21:00,612
He was pissed
at the size of the vig.

479
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,047
He threatened to
kill my boss

480
00:21:02,114 --> 00:21:04,115
if he didn't
get a refund...

481
00:21:04,183 --> 00:21:05,650
So your boss
killed him first.

482
00:21:07,654 --> 00:21:09,555
Chew.

483
00:21:11,591 --> 00:21:13,325
Maybe.

484
00:21:13,393 --> 00:21:15,261
Maybe, okay?

485
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:16,595
Either he did it

486
00:21:16,663 --> 00:21:18,030
or he's got muscle.

487
00:21:18,098 --> 00:21:21,133
I just know I didn't.

488
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:23,569
Your boss have a name?

489
00:21:23,636 --> 00:21:26,671
Yeah. I mean,
everyone's got a name.

490
00:21:26,739 --> 00:21:29,407
But I don't know it
or how to reach him.

491
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:31,442
You had a package to deliver.

492
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:35,446
Which means you know
where he's gonna be.

493
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:38,582
Uh-huh.

494
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,050
Yeah, yeah.

495
00:21:41,386 --> 00:21:42,786
Thank you for your cooperation.

496
00:21:42,854 --> 00:21:45,189
We will contact you if we have
any more questions.

497
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,595
That was a waste.

498
00:21:50,663 --> 00:21:52,330
He had nothing to add
to his statement

499
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:54,032
about the robbery
at the bakery,

500
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,467
and I'm not going back in there

501
00:21:55,535 --> 00:21:56,968
unless it is absolutely
fumigated.

502
00:21:57,036 --> 00:21:59,004
Twice.

503
00:21:59,072 --> 00:22:00,639
Jethro.

504
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:02,307
Oh, thank goodness
I found you.

505
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,176
Whoa.

506
00:22:04,244 --> 00:22:05,877
What... what is that smell?

507
00:22:05,945 --> 00:22:07,079
Duck.
Huh?

508
00:22:07,146 --> 00:22:08,346
Oh, sorry.

509
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:11,249
Uh, I just received
an e-mail from Abby

510
00:22:11,317 --> 00:22:13,385
alerting me to an
alarming oversight.

511
00:22:13,452 --> 00:22:16,021
It seems there
was a minor error

512
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:18,557
in one of my internal
reports five weeks ago.

513
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,891
What kind of error?

514
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:22,093
Well, as you know, the
Port-to-Port Killer

515
00:22:22,161 --> 00:22:24,096
secures his victim's
feet with rope.

516
00:22:24,163 --> 00:22:26,398
The specific knot is called
a double constrictor.

517
00:22:26,466 --> 00:22:27,733
Double?

518
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:29,367
I thought it was
a plain constrictor knot.

519
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:31,169
Well, that is
the error.

520
00:22:31,237 --> 00:22:33,505
Mr. Palmer managed
to leave out the word "double"

521
00:22:33,573 --> 00:22:35,174
when he transcribed my notes.

522
00:22:35,242 --> 00:22:36,909
I have suitably chastised him,
but I...

523
00:22:36,977 --> 00:22:38,544
It's a typo, Duck.
Fix it.

524
00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:39,879
Jethro.

525
00:22:39,947 --> 00:22:41,747
Jethro!

526
00:22:41,815 --> 00:22:45,785
The knot on our latest
victim's feet

527
00:22:45,853 --> 00:22:47,854
is a single constrictor.

528
00:22:47,922 --> 00:22:50,657
It's almost as if someone
is using my notes,

529
00:22:50,725 --> 00:22:53,093
typo and all, to
duplicate the murders.

530
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,430
I know details can change
for several reasons,

531
00:22:56,497 --> 00:22:58,632
but given
the Port-to-Port Killer's

532
00:22:58,699 --> 00:23:01,201
almost pathological need
for consistency,

533
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:03,103
I can only think of
one in this case.

534
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,438
It's not the
Port-to-Port Killer.

535
00:23:04,505 --> 00:23:07,040
We have a copycat, Jethro.

536
00:23:07,108 --> 00:23:12,111
And one who has access
to our internal records.

537
00:23:21,074 --> 00:23:23,542
The copycat killer is
using one of Ducky's reports

538
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:25,077
to recreate the murders.

539
00:23:25,145 --> 00:23:26,445
They look almost identical,

540
00:23:26,513 --> 00:23:28,080
but this is the wrong knot.

541
00:23:28,148 --> 00:23:29,782
How'd he get access?
I'm running

542
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,450
a system-wide check now.
So far nothing.

543
00:23:31,518 --> 00:23:34,521
Unfortunately, this means
that our psych profile

544
00:23:34,588 --> 00:23:35,922
is now worthless.

545
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,958
We have very little to go on.

546
00:23:38,026 --> 00:23:39,560
The real Port-to-Port Killer
knew how to cover his trail.

547
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,028
Maybe this one didn't.

548
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:43,597
We might be able to trace one
of his purchases back to him.

549
00:23:43,665 --> 00:23:45,566
Rerun it all--
knife, rope,

550
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,368
antiseptic, all of it.
Got something else.

551
00:23:48,435 --> 00:23:49,602
Found my cell.

552
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,837
Left it over at EJ's.

553
00:23:54,174 --> 00:23:55,974
Lot of missed calls.

554
00:23:56,042 --> 00:23:59,577
Only one message worth
mentioning-- from two days ago.

555
00:23:59,645 --> 00:24:02,347
Hey, Tony, it's Danny.

556
00:24:02,415 --> 00:24:04,449
Long time, no speak.

557
00:24:05,752 --> 00:24:08,053
Uh, I've been thinking
about things lately.

558
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:11,324
Old friends and TV dinners,
things I messed up,

559
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:15,462
things right in front of my face
I should have seen.

560
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:18,799
But I'm not the only one
who saw what he wanted to.

561
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:22,269
We need to talk.

562
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:24,271
Better late than never, huh?

563
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:25,672
Know what that was about?

564
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,408
No, but it's definitely
connected to the murder.

565
00:24:28,476 --> 00:24:30,577
Might mean Price
knows his killer.

566
00:24:30,644 --> 00:24:32,378
Which means I might, too.

567
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:38,985
We need to talk.

568
00:24:39,052 --> 00:24:40,553
Hold on one second.

569
00:24:42,222 --> 00:24:43,990
Testing, one, two, three.

570
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:46,259
Can you hear me over there
in the Joey Peanuts gallery?

571
00:24:46,327 --> 00:24:48,896
Yeah, no, I can hear you.
Very funny.

572
00:24:48,964 --> 00:24:50,931
Now, listen.

573
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:53,334
I want you to drop off
the bag with your boss,

574
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:55,103
then get him to
cop to the murder.

575
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,973
And then, Joey Peanuts,
you get to do

576
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,210
five years of community service,
if you're lucky.

577
00:25:01,277 --> 00:25:02,544
Thanks.

578
00:25:02,612 --> 00:25:04,313
No. Thank you, Joey.

579
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,081
All right.

580
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:07,616
What is it?

581
00:25:07,683 --> 00:25:09,885
This fell out of your jacket.

582
00:25:11,154 --> 00:25:12,621
Hmm?

583
00:25:12,689 --> 00:25:15,923
You planning to propose
to Wendy or something?

584
00:25:15,991 --> 00:25:18,359
Actually, I already did.

585
00:25:18,426 --> 00:25:19,793
What?

586
00:25:19,861 --> 00:25:21,228
Yeah.

587
00:25:21,296 --> 00:25:23,530
I got to take it back
and get it resized, though.

588
00:25:23,598 --> 00:25:24,865
Evidently, it's a little small.

589
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:27,668
Well... so she said...

590
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:29,603
She said yes, you smart-ass.

591
00:25:29,671 --> 00:25:31,672
And you were going
to tell me this when?

592
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:34,375
I haven't told anybody.

593
00:25:34,442 --> 00:25:35,643
In case she said no?

594
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,678
No. I just wanted
to tell her first

595
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:39,146
before I told anyone else.

596
00:25:39,214 --> 00:25:42,450
Okay. Okay.

597
00:25:42,517 --> 00:25:44,118
Well, congrats, man.
Excellent. Thanks.

598
00:25:46,555 --> 00:25:49,523
Oh. We got company.

599
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,295
Civilian clothes.

600
00:25:56,363 --> 00:25:58,998
Military haircut...
and shoes.

601
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,501
You count it?

602
00:26:01,568 --> 00:26:02,968
It's all there, man--
50 grand.

603
00:26:03,036 --> 00:26:05,771
How did we end up doing
the Navy cop's job for him?

604
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,173
'Cause he's smarter than us?

605
00:26:07,241 --> 00:26:09,309
Mmm. More devious, maybe.

606
00:26:09,376 --> 00:26:11,444
I don't know about smarter.

607
00:26:11,512 --> 00:26:12,712
I kind of liked him, actually.

608
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,147
Who'd want to be
a Navy cop?

609
00:26:14,215 --> 00:26:16,349
I'd rather have the plague.

610
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:18,018
It's really sad

611
00:26:18,085 --> 00:26:21,088
how Tony and his old partner
drifted so far apart.

612
00:26:21,155 --> 00:26:22,456
It happens.
Does that mean it could happen

613
00:26:22,523 --> 00:26:24,257
to my Three Musketeers?
'Cause if you say yes, McGee,

614
00:26:24,325 --> 00:26:25,492
I'm going to start
crying right now.

615
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,827
No, whatever it is.

616
00:26:26,894 --> 00:26:28,128
What do you got, Abbs?

617
00:26:28,196 --> 00:26:30,530
Suspects, and a lot of them.

618
00:26:30,598 --> 00:26:32,499
The last actual
Port-to-Port killing,

619
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:34,301
I was able to track
down the suppliers

620
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,803
of most of the
items he used.

621
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,771
Brand of antiseptic,
surgical blade.

622
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,806
But I couldn't trace it
back to the killer.

623
00:26:39,874 --> 00:26:41,875
He was very careful to
disguise his purchases.

624
00:26:41,943 --> 00:26:44,845
So, to find the copycat,
we are analyzing

625
00:26:44,912 --> 00:26:46,546
publicly available tax receipts,

626
00:26:46,614 --> 00:26:48,148
looking for people
who bought

627
00:26:48,216 --> 00:26:50,016
three or more of the items
that are in

628
00:26:50,084 --> 00:26:51,952
the Port-to-Port Killer's toolbox.
Okay. How many?

629
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,387
26 so far, and we're not
even halfway through.

630
00:26:55,523 --> 00:26:56,623
That's our guy.

631
00:26:56,691 --> 00:26:58,391
And you know this
because?

632
00:26:58,459 --> 00:27:00,393
He was at the crime scene.

633
00:27:00,461 --> 00:27:03,297
All right, well, let
me run facial recognition

634
00:27:03,364 --> 00:27:05,732
against our
crime scene photos.

635
00:27:07,069 --> 00:27:09,069
There.

636
00:27:12,407 --> 00:27:14,008
Boss, he's a computer tech.

637
00:27:14,075 --> 00:27:15,976
That means he could have
hacked our servers

638
00:27:16,044 --> 00:27:18,679
and gotten Ducky's report.

639
00:27:18,747 --> 00:27:21,114
How on Earth did you...
Rule number 35.

640
00:27:23,217 --> 00:27:26,086
Always watch the watchers.
Always watch the watchers.

641
00:27:26,154 --> 00:27:27,955
You count it?

642
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:31,091
It's all there, man-- 50 grand.

643
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:32,292
That's more than
I make in a year.

644
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,527
I made sure that he knew

645
00:27:33,594 --> 00:27:34,728
what the vig was up front.

646
00:27:34,796 --> 00:27:36,696
You know, man,
I got enough on my hands

647
00:27:36,764 --> 00:27:37,897
worrying about
that Franklin guy.

648
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:39,098
Nice segue.

649
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,166
Yeah.

650
00:27:40,234 --> 00:27:41,400
Well, you can stop worrying.

651
00:27:41,468 --> 00:27:44,070
I took care of things--
permanently.

652
00:27:45,606 --> 00:27:47,007
Well, it'd be nice
to have ballistics

653
00:27:47,075 --> 00:27:48,242
tying this guy
to the murder,

654
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,877
but that sounds like
a confession to me.

655
00:27:49,945 --> 00:27:51,112
Why didn't you
bring him in?

656
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,781
Uh, Agent Gibbs wanted
to I.D. him first.

657
00:27:52,848 --> 00:27:54,649
Didn't want us to tip
our hand in case he

658
00:27:54,717 --> 00:27:56,018
wasn't working alone.
It doesn't matter.

659
00:27:56,085 --> 00:27:58,020
We put a tail on him.
We're going to get our own I.D.

660
00:27:58,088 --> 00:27:59,088
before this guy...

661
00:28:03,394 --> 00:28:04,627
It's him.
Mmm.

662
00:28:04,695 --> 00:28:05,928
Let me know.

663
00:28:07,231 --> 00:28:08,331
What do you got?

664
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,033
His name's Lieutenant Ian Floyd.

665
00:28:10,101 --> 00:28:12,035
Hold on. Hold on.

666
00:28:12,103 --> 00:28:14,738
His name's Lieutenant Ian Floyd.

667
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:18,241
He's a disbursing officer at a
Navy payroll office in Quantico.

668
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:20,977
Oh. That's a perfect position
to launder money.

669
00:28:21,045 --> 00:28:22,645
He have any help?

670
00:28:22,713 --> 00:28:24,314
You need to get that?

671
00:28:24,381 --> 00:28:26,016
No. It's my wife.

672
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,417
And no.

673
00:28:27,485 --> 00:28:29,420
No. Looks like it's just Floyd.

674
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:30,821
We should check
to see when ballistics

675
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:33,357
on the murder weapon's
going to be done.

676
00:28:34,793 --> 00:28:35,860
It's done.

677
00:28:35,928 --> 00:28:37,528
I don't think so.

678
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:39,431
Yeah, I had the evidence
transferred here.

679
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:41,700
Weapon was a Walther P99.

680
00:28:41,768 --> 00:28:44,068
Floyd's got two registered
to him. Pick him up.

681
00:28:44,136 --> 00:28:45,570
Uh, first of all,
that was our evidence.

682
00:28:45,637 --> 00:28:46,938
And second of all,

683
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:50,441
if we just transferred it
to you, then how did you get...

684
00:28:51,843 --> 00:28:53,377
Ah. I got to get this one.

685
00:28:53,445 --> 00:28:55,179
Is that your wife again?

686
00:28:55,247 --> 00:28:57,047
Divorce lawyer.

687
00:28:58,382 --> 00:29:00,784
We've been waiting
for ballistics for over a week.

688
00:29:00,851 --> 00:29:02,552
Roscoe, hang on a second.
Pacci.

689
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,321
You got that other thing for me?
Yeah.

690
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:06,423
Detective DiNozzo's personnel
file is right here.

691
00:29:06,491 --> 00:29:08,826
Anything else? I was going
to head to the infirmary.

692
00:29:08,894 --> 00:29:10,394
My ulcer's
killing me again.

693
00:29:10,462 --> 00:29:13,230
I'm telling you, this stomach
is going to be the death of me.

694
00:29:13,298 --> 00:29:15,433
Roscoe, go ahead.

695
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:17,235
Let's hope our copycat's home.

696
00:29:17,303 --> 00:29:18,604
NCIS!

697
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:21,841
Hands in the air!
Peter Sears,

698
00:29:21,908 --> 00:29:23,609
you're under arrest.
For what? I didn't do anything.

699
00:29:23,677 --> 00:29:25,043
Oh, my God, this is so exciting.

700
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:26,445
You have the right
to remain silent,

701
00:29:26,512 --> 00:29:28,046
or I can shut
you up myself.

702
00:29:28,113 --> 00:29:29,347
Take it easy, DiNozzo.

703
00:29:29,414 --> 00:29:30,748
You also have the
right to an attorney so he

704
00:29:30,816 --> 00:29:32,950
can tell you how you weren't
hugged enough as a child.

705
00:29:33,017 --> 00:29:35,485
Boss?
We got a problem.

706
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:56,407
Can we have
a time-out here?

707
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:58,776
I get how bad this looks.

708
00:29:58,844 --> 00:30:00,478
Xeonphine
antiseptic.

709
00:30:01,881 --> 00:30:03,882
Surgical blades.

710
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,950
That's you.

711
00:30:06,018 --> 00:30:08,753
At the victim's crime scene.

712
00:30:08,821 --> 00:30:10,722
Rare orchid seeds.

713
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:13,224
Practice knots.

714
00:30:13,292 --> 00:30:15,760
Well, you put together
a real cute little

715
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:16,895
Port-to-Port Killer magic kit,

716
00:30:16,963 --> 00:30:18,663
and then you killed
my partner with it.

717
00:30:18,731 --> 00:30:20,431
I told you,
I didn't kill anybody!

718
00:30:23,836 --> 00:30:25,136
This is intense.

719
00:30:25,204 --> 00:30:26,938
I think he's confused,
DiNozzo.

720
00:30:27,006 --> 00:30:28,340
Me, too.

721
00:30:28,408 --> 00:30:30,242
See, we don't need
a confession.

722
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,011
We just need to know
how you hacked our servers,

723
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:35,714
because this knot isn't
mentioned in the press,

724
00:30:35,781 --> 00:30:38,449
which means you only could have
learned about it from us.

725
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,153
I'm the worst loser
on the entire planet.

726
00:30:43,723 --> 00:30:46,592
I haven't even started yet,
and I got arrested.

727
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:57,371
I bought all those things.

728
00:30:57,472 --> 00:30:58,907
I tied those knots.

729
00:30:58,974 --> 00:31:00,775
Practice makes
perfect, right?

730
00:31:00,843 --> 00:31:03,077
That's what Uncle Tickle Fingers
always said.

731
00:31:03,145 --> 00:31:04,546
Practice makes perfect.

732
00:31:05,881 --> 00:31:07,848
But that's all I've done
was practice.

733
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:09,049
Maybe I was going
to do something.

734
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,884
Maybe I was going to get
my name on TV, too,

735
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,519
but you know what?
I haven't done it yet.

736
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:18,057
You got the wrong guy, bucko.

737
00:31:29,004 --> 00:31:29,070
Sears' alibi checks out.

738
00:31:30,826 --> 00:31:32,627
He's an I.T. consultant,

739
00:31:32,695 --> 00:31:35,096
but he works part-time
as a birthday clown.

740
00:31:35,164 --> 00:31:36,297
He was twisting
balloon animals

741
00:31:36,365 --> 00:31:38,066
for 20 kids
when Price was killed.

742
00:31:38,134 --> 00:31:39,667
Well, that is
disturbing.

743
00:31:39,735 --> 00:31:41,770
Yeah.
He's a copycat killer, boss...

744
00:31:41,837 --> 00:31:43,004
He just hasn't killed yet.

745
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:45,106
Where's the Pre-crime Unit
when you need it?

746
00:31:45,174 --> 00:31:46,607
Remember that
in <i>Minority Report?</i>

747
00:31:46,675 --> 00:31:48,776
Colin Farrell and Tom Cruise...
I'd rather have a lead.

748
00:31:48,844 --> 00:31:50,511
Uh, there's still the
robbery at the bakery.

749
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:51,779
And I think I've got
something on that.

750
00:31:51,847 --> 00:31:54,381
Ohio State Police
just arrested

751
00:31:54,449 --> 00:31:56,216
two men for
grand larceny.

752
00:31:56,284 --> 00:31:57,585
One wants to plea-bargain.

753
00:31:57,653 --> 00:31:59,287
Says he has info on a robbery

754
00:31:59,355 --> 00:32:01,456
at the Fortune Cookie Company
bakery in Baltimore.

755
00:32:01,524 --> 00:32:03,525
Call the prosecutor.
I'm going to call the prosecutor.

756
00:32:03,592 --> 00:32:05,593
Went through Sear's
laptop, as well.

757
00:32:05,661 --> 00:32:07,495
I know how he learned about
the constrictor knot,

758
00:32:07,563 --> 00:32:09,164
and it's not from
an NCIS file.

759
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:11,633
Where? Right before
Barrett left for Hawaii,

760
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,768
she issued an update
on the Port-to-Port Killer

761
00:32:13,836 --> 00:32:16,470
to all law enforcement
agencies in the area.

762
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:17,605
It included Palmer's typo.

763
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:18,939
Sears stole a copy

764
00:32:19,007 --> 00:32:20,573
of the report
while he was doing

765
00:32:20,641 --> 00:32:22,142
I.T. work in a
police station.

766
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:23,710
Which means that our copycat

767
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:26,246
is someone who had
access to that report.

768
00:32:29,918 --> 00:32:32,119
I have a degree
in physical education!

769
00:32:32,186 --> 00:32:34,821
I played varsity basketball
at Ohio State!

770
00:32:34,889 --> 00:32:36,923
This isn't gonna end
well for you!

771
00:32:36,991 --> 00:32:38,625
Your money laundering days...

772
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,730
...are over!

773
00:32:48,037 --> 00:32:50,472
Stop!

774
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:52,207
Or this isn't gonna
end well for you.

775
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:54,043
Hey, is that a Walther P99?

776
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,444
Thanks.
Now we don't have

777
00:32:55,512 --> 00:32:56,746
to find
the murder weapon.

778
00:32:56,814 --> 00:32:58,548
I walk out of here or I shoot.

779
00:32:58,616 --> 00:33:00,684
You're not walking out of here.

780
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:02,085
I'm serious!

781
00:33:02,153 --> 00:33:03,654
So are we.

782
00:33:08,126 --> 00:33:10,026
So that's how it's gonna be.

783
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:13,530
Nice timing.

784
00:33:13,597 --> 00:33:15,165
Hey, better late than never.

785
00:33:50,502 --> 00:33:51,936
DiNozzo.

786
00:33:52,003 --> 00:33:53,404
Tony, where did you go?

787
00:33:53,472 --> 00:33:54,539
Following a hunch.

788
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:55,773
What's up?

789
00:33:55,841 --> 00:33:57,208
Well, Ohio came through.

790
00:33:57,276 --> 00:34:00,178
It's confirmed, we got the guy
that robbed the bakery.

791
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,080
You don't sound too happy
about it.

792
00:34:02,148 --> 00:34:03,615
Speeding ticket puts him
in Dayton

793
00:34:03,682 --> 00:34:05,049
the day that Price was killed.

794
00:34:05,117 --> 00:34:06,618
So he's not our copycat.

795
00:34:06,685 --> 00:34:08,386
If you see Gibbs,
can you tell him?

796
00:34:08,454 --> 00:34:09,921
Yeah, sure.

797
00:34:13,191 --> 00:34:15,058
Hey, Tony. It's Danny.

798
00:34:15,126 --> 00:34:16,893
Long time, no speak.

799
00:34:16,961 --> 00:34:20,263
Uh, been thinking
about things lately.

800
00:34:20,331 --> 00:34:22,765
Old friends and TV dinners...

801
00:34:36,778 --> 00:34:38,078
Ah.

802
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:47,087
You born in a barn?

803
00:34:47,154 --> 00:34:48,855
It's freezing out.
Close the door.

804
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:50,257
D.A. says we got enough

805
00:34:50,324 --> 00:34:51,892
to get a murder conviction
against Lieutenant Floyd.

806
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,761
You came all this way
to tell me that?

807
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:55,830
Actually, I came all the way
here because of what I saw

808
00:34:55,898 --> 00:34:58,600
in Floyd's eyes
when you got the drop on him.

809
00:34:58,668 --> 00:35:00,436
Something that I spent
the last two days

810
00:35:00,503 --> 00:35:04,206
trying to pretend
I didn't see.

811
00:35:04,274 --> 00:35:05,674
And what's that?

812
00:35:05,742 --> 00:35:07,743
Betrayal.

813
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:09,745
'Cause he knew you.

814
00:35:09,813 --> 00:35:12,013
And I'm wondering
to myself,

815
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:13,348
"How can that be?"

816
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:15,883
It didn't make
any sense.

817
00:35:15,951 --> 00:35:17,618
So I pulled your phone records.

818
00:35:17,686 --> 00:35:20,420
The two of you, a couple
of chatty-patties, huh?

819
00:35:20,488 --> 00:35:22,122
15 calls over the
last two months.

820
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,757
I know there's plenty of ways
to explain that, right?

821
00:35:24,825 --> 00:35:26,893
There's only one reason

822
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:28,395
you never mentioned it.

823
00:35:28,463 --> 00:35:29,563
What's that?

824
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,797
'Cause you're a dirty cop,
Danny.

825
00:35:30,865 --> 00:35:32,199
Tony, come on.

826
00:35:32,267 --> 00:35:33,601
Careful.

827
00:35:33,668 --> 00:35:35,603
Be very careful.

828
00:35:37,506 --> 00:35:39,975
I'm not feeling the love
right now.

829
00:35:46,684 --> 00:35:48,785
Okay.

830
00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:53,824
I was sending
potential clients...

831
00:35:53,891 --> 00:35:56,359
in Floyd's direction.

832
00:35:56,427 --> 00:35:59,129
If they laundered money
through him,

833
00:35:59,197 --> 00:36:00,797
I got a kickback.

834
00:36:00,865 --> 00:36:03,533
So how much did you get
to keep your mouth shut

835
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:04,934
on a homicide, Danny?

836
00:36:05,002 --> 00:36:08,438
No, no, Tony, I had no idea
that Floyd was our guy.

837
00:36:08,506 --> 00:36:11,041
I mean, did he seem
like a killer to you?

838
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:12,910
He didn't seem
like one to me!

839
00:36:12,978 --> 00:36:14,579
You saw what you
wanted to see.

840
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,987
So what are you gonna do?

841
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:32,731
I lost my appetite.

842
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,012
So I'm gonna take a walk.

843
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,148
I guess if you're still here
when I get back,

844
00:36:51,216 --> 00:36:53,417
I'll have my answer.

845
00:37:11,535 --> 00:37:12,902
Heads up!

846
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:15,838
I'm in a shoot-first,
ask-questions-later frame of mind.

847
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,410
You followed me?

848
00:37:24,981 --> 00:37:26,515
How long did you know?

849
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:28,217
Didn't.

850
00:37:28,284 --> 00:37:29,718
Just a hunch, huh?

851
00:37:29,786 --> 00:37:32,789
What are you gonna do?

852
00:37:32,856 --> 00:37:34,123
He's your partner.

853
00:37:34,191 --> 00:37:38,095
Yeah.

854
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,699
What am I gonna do?

855
00:37:41,766 --> 00:37:43,100
DANNY
...things I messed up,

856
00:37:43,168 --> 00:37:46,137
things right in front of my face
I should have seen.

857
00:37:46,205 --> 00:37:50,207
But I'm not the only one
who saw what he wanted to.

858
00:37:50,275 --> 00:37:51,475
We need to talk.

859
00:37:51,543 --> 00:37:53,310
Better late than never, huh?

860
00:37:53,377 --> 00:37:55,611
Son of a bitch.

861
00:37:59,816 --> 00:38:01,917
Followed me again.

862
00:38:01,985 --> 00:38:04,152
Another hunch?

863
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,320
No,

864
00:38:05,388 --> 00:38:06,554
but I could see
you had one.

865
00:38:06,622 --> 00:38:09,191
Danny was dirty.

866
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:12,028
I always wondered why the money
launderer didn't rat him out,

867
00:38:12,096 --> 00:38:13,296
try to cut a deal.

868
00:38:13,364 --> 00:38:14,931
I bet Danny wondered
the same thing.

869
00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:16,366
There's only one reason
to be afraid

870
00:38:16,434 --> 00:38:18,335
of sending a dirty cop to jail.

871
00:38:18,403 --> 00:38:20,772
There's another one you can't,

872
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:24,976
and in our department,
that was a pretty short list.

873
00:38:26,379 --> 00:38:29,081
There was a silent partner
Danny didn't know about,

874
00:38:29,149 --> 00:38:31,317
but he found out
after all these years.

875
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:35,254
"Better late than never"
is right.

876
00:38:37,257 --> 00:38:39,726
I think he was looking
for redemption.

877
00:38:40,761 --> 00:38:43,396
Well, let's go give it to him.

878
00:38:44,465 --> 00:38:46,999
Oh, ladies and gentlemen,

879
00:38:47,067 --> 00:38:48,568
the legend is back,

880
00:38:48,635 --> 00:38:49,936
Anthony DiNozzo, Jr.

881
00:38:50,004 --> 00:38:51,538
Hey.

882
00:38:51,605 --> 00:38:54,206
Look at what the cat
dragged in.

883
00:38:54,274 --> 00:38:56,209
Agent Gibbs, right?

884
00:38:56,276 --> 00:38:57,943
Man who took my best
detective from me.

885
00:39:01,147 --> 00:39:03,414
What's this?
Your evidence locker logs.

886
00:39:03,482 --> 00:39:05,583
That's how you got the tray
to make the fortune cookie,

887
00:39:05,651 --> 00:39:07,018
which was a
nice touch,

888
00:39:07,086 --> 00:39:09,588
but of course you made your
bones busting serial killers,

889
00:39:09,655 --> 00:39:11,189
so you knew how to
make it smell real.

890
00:39:11,257 --> 00:39:13,659
Danny was right.

891
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:15,228
Lieutenant Floyd
wasn't a killer.

892
00:39:15,295 --> 00:39:16,229
It was you.

893
00:39:16,297 --> 00:39:17,797
What are you talking about?

894
00:39:17,865 --> 00:39:19,933
Danny figured it out

895
00:39:20,001 --> 00:39:22,403
and he was going to set
the record straight,

896
00:39:22,471 --> 00:39:23,904
so you killed him.

897
00:39:26,341 --> 00:39:28,041
Major,

898
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:30,310
you knew that DiNozzo
wasn't going to let it go.

899
00:39:30,378 --> 00:39:31,979
So you threw
it in my face.

900
00:39:32,047 --> 00:39:34,114
Dropped another body on
the Port-to-Port pile.

901
00:39:35,383 --> 00:39:37,117
Did you think I would
just assume it was...

902
00:39:38,152 --> 00:39:40,420
...a serial killer?

903
00:39:40,488 --> 00:39:42,289
Let me ask you

904
00:39:42,356 --> 00:39:44,124
what do you see when
you look in the mirror?

905
00:39:47,028 --> 00:39:48,963
Am I done?
Oh, yeah,

906
00:39:49,031 --> 00:39:51,031
you're done.

907
00:40:10,353 --> 00:40:12,454
Could you imagine
having to arrest Gibbs?

908
00:40:13,556 --> 00:40:15,090
I would rather
arrest my father,

909
00:40:15,157 --> 00:40:16,458
and I still might have to
one day,

910
00:40:16,526 --> 00:40:17,592
for that matter.
Jethro,

911
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,861
congratulations
on catching

912
00:40:19,928 --> 00:40:21,496
the copycat killer.
Thanks, Duck.

913
00:40:21,563 --> 00:40:23,798
However, we have
another problem.

914
00:40:23,866 --> 00:40:28,002
Remember I told you about that
e-mail from Abby concerning

915
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,937
the typo in my report?

916
00:40:30,005 --> 00:40:31,138
Yeah.
I didn't send

917
00:40:31,206 --> 00:40:32,606
Ducky that e-mail,
Gibbs.

918
00:40:32,674 --> 00:40:33,741
Then who was it from?

919
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:36,310
Presumably someone
who wanted us to know

920
00:40:36,378 --> 00:40:38,279
we were chasing
a copycat killer.

921
00:40:38,347 --> 00:40:40,614
And there's only one person
that could have been.

922
00:40:40,682 --> 00:40:42,049
The real one.

923
00:40:42,117 --> 00:40:43,818
Show me.

924
00:41:01,302 --> 00:41:03,237
I got it.

925
00:41:03,304 --> 00:41:05,506
You made it.

926
00:41:05,574 --> 00:41:06,740
Yeah.

927
00:41:06,808 --> 00:41:08,809
Wow, I'm not a big fan
of the orange,

928
00:41:08,877 --> 00:41:11,745
and the glare off that
skylight's ridiculous.

929
00:41:18,153 --> 00:41:20,087
You gonna ask?

930
00:41:20,155 --> 00:41:21,956
Nope.

931
00:41:22,023 --> 00:41:24,625
I'm leaving it alone.

932
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:26,226
It was wrong,
way wrong, but...

933
00:41:26,294 --> 00:41:27,561
It's your partner.

934
00:41:27,628 --> 00:41:28,862
Ex-partner.

935
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,832
I'm not going back to
Baltimore, I can't.

936
00:41:31,899 --> 00:41:33,266
I don't know what
I'm gonna do.

937
00:41:33,334 --> 00:41:35,635
Maybe being a cop
isn't for me.

938
00:41:40,408 --> 00:41:42,343
Did you just
physically assault me?

939
00:41:42,411 --> 00:41:45,012
I don't have a lot of rules,

940
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,283
but rule number five
is "you don't waste good,"

941
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,251
and you're good.

942
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,154
Thanks.

943
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:56,292
Don't make a habit of that.

944
00:42:06,538 --> 00:42:09,106
Did I mention
you're a devious man, Gibbs?

945
00:42:09,174 --> 00:42:10,674
Boy, I got vision,

946
00:42:10,742 --> 00:42:13,677
and the rest of the world
is wearing bifocals.

947
00:42:13,745 --> 00:42:14,879
Butch Cassidy.

948
00:42:14,946 --> 00:42:16,380
Nice!

949
00:42:29,293 --> 00:42:33,293
