in Suite 317
of the Metropol Hotel.

10
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,936
Why?

11
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:28,189
My house was burned down.

12
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,774
Occupation?

13
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:33,444
It is not the business of
gentlemen to have occupations.

14
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:39,117
You do not seem to appreciate
the gravity of your position.

15
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,162
No, I fear I understand
it perfectly.

16
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,874
You left Russia for Paris
in the spring of 1914?

17
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,459
Yes, I remember apple blossom
in the trees.

18
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,212
In all likelihood,
it was spring, yes.

19
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,548
What concerns us here

20
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,967
is your return in 1918.

21
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,679
Why did you come back only
a year after the Revolution?

22
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,265
You must have understood
the reception a man of your...

23
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,976
nobility would receive.

24
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,478
I missed the climate.

25
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,981
Are you the author

26
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,233
of this poem of 1913:

27
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,236
"Where Is Our Purpose Now?"

28
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,245
Were you the author?

29
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,209
It was attributed to me, yes.

30
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,213
Many consider this poem

31
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,256
a call to revolutionary action.

32
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,925
Hard for us to equate with a man

33
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,595
who has clearly succumbed
to the corruptions of his class

34
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:44,599
and now is a threat against
Russia and her people.

35
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,267
I am one of her people.

36
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,685
You were.

37
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,564
It is our inclination to have
you put against the wall.

38
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,154
But there are those within
the senior ranks of the Party

39
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,323
who, because of your poem,

40
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,910
count you among the heroes
of the revolutionary cause.

41
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,371
Therefore, it is the judgment
of this committee,

42
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,415
now the Metropol is under
full Party control,

43
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,335
that you be returned to the
hotel of which you are so fond,

44
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,922
where you will remain
for the rest of your days.

45
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,928
And make no mistake,

46
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:26,391
should you ever set foot
outside of the Metropol again,

47
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,601
you will be shot.

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,973
Are you still, uh,
living at the old palace?

167
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,600
They've taken it over.

168
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,604
But, um, they let me keep
a room.

169
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,983
Well, at least we have
our health.

170
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,781
Well, I-I'd better get on.

171
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,201
Of course. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to keep you.

172
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,913
Perhaps w-we could have
a drink at the bar

173
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,998
after my dinner.

174
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,669
I'd like that very much.

175
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,464
Nikolai.

176
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:57,177
They can take away your house
or your rooms.

177
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:00,681
They can't take away
who you are.

178
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,255
<i>I thought you were in Paris.</i>

179
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,591
Why on earth did you return
to this madhouse?

180
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:40,512
To get my grandmother
safely on a ship to England.

181
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,349
Audrius, could we have
the same again?

182
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,059
Yes, Your Excellency.

183
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,895
Thank you.

184
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,151
I was sorry to hear
about your sister.

185
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,240
What are we still doing here?

186
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,035
When I was a young boy,

187
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,872
not long after my parents died,
my grandmother the Countess

188
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,291
invited a boy over
from the neighboring estate.

189
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,418
She thought it might
cheer me up.

190
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,753
Obolensky he was called.

191
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:16,924
He beat me
at a game of draughts.

192
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,300
I didn't take it well.

193
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,552
Tears were shed,
pieces were scattered.

194
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,262
I might even have uttered
a curse.

195
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,431
Later that evening,

196
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,475
she found me still full of rage.

197
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,643
And she said,

198
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,188
"There's nothing pleasant
to be said about losing,

199
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,816
and that Obolensky boy
certainly is a pill,

200
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:38,612
but, Sasha, my dear,
why on earth

201
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,949
would you give him
the satisfaction?"

202
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,621
Obolensky...

203
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,415
That's not Vladimir Obolensky,
is it?

204
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,167
Of the Nizhny Obolenskys?

205
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,710
- Yes, the very same.
- Oh.

206
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,588
Your grandmother's correct,
he is a pill.

207
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,548
He was.

208
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,969
They burned him alive
in his house.

209
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,265
They won't stop, Sasha.

210
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:15,816
I know someone wh-who can...

211
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:20,153
provide papers
ensuring safe transit.

212
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,490
We-we could leave the country.

213
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,159
Unless we were recognized
en route.

214
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,661
Well, you'd have
to clip your wings.

215
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,163
No, that alone is
a good reason to stay.

216
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,332
Sasha, how can you joke?

217
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,710
Because if I take it seriously,

218
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:39,464
I could fall into a dark despair
I could find no way out from.

219
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,717
There's no bars
across the doors.

220
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,094
Once you're out of the hotel,
we could disappear.

221
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,596
Go east, go west.

222
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,223
We could start again.

223
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,726
As who? As what?

224
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:54,104
Does it matter?
We would be alive.

225
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,818
This is still my country.

226
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,281
Thank you.

227
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,659
To Russia.

228
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,704
To Russia.

229
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,583
<i>♪ ominous music ♪</i>

230
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,174
Is it just us now?

231
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:34,353
Yes, you're so good.

232
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,726
Apologies for my tardiness.

233
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,687
What will it be today,
Your Excellency?

234
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:21,024
Just the usual,
if you'd be so kind.

235
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,068
I was next.

236
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:27,072
I will be with you
in just a moment, sir.

237
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,323
I was here before he was.

238
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,534
Oh, uh, I have
a standing appointment

239
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,077
at 12 on a Tuesday.

240
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,703
If you would just please wait.

241
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,789
Why should I?
Why should he go before me?

242
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,416
Well, as I explained, I have a--

243
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,751
He has a standing appointment.

244
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,463
I was here first.

245
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,716
You'll have your appointment
soon enough.

246
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,718
Your Excellency.

247
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,142
Hey!

248
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,902
Thank you.

249
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,958
Oh, that won't be necessary.
I know it by heart.

250
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:24,421
Oh, you must be the guest
from the top floor.

251
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,841
Yes, delighted to make
your acquaintance.

252
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,095
Oh, um...

253
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,973
Well, yes,
I will have the fillet of sole.

254
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:40,145
Would you like a glass of wine
with your fish?

255
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,105
A Sauternes, perhaps?

256
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,441
Oh, I think a bottle
of Chateau Baudelaire

257
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,318
might be more fitting.

258
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:50,739
Of course.

259
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,450
Thank you.

260
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,918
- Your fish, sir?
- Ah.

261
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,295
Ah, that looks delicious.
Thank...

262
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,387
Mmm.

263
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,892
- Where did they go?
- I beg your pardon?

264
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,645
- Your mustaches.
- Well, they, uh...

265
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,105
- I... it...
- Is it true that you're a count?

266
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,650
- It is.
- Have you ever known a princess?

267
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,401
I have known many princesses.

268
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,903
Was it terribly hard
to be a princess?

269
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:34,574
Terribly. Especially so
since our glorious revolution.

270
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,219
Is that any good?

271
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,556
Didn't you have a lunch
of your own?

272
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,267
- At a different table?
- I didn't like it.

273
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,609
With my compliments.

274
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,574
Hmm.

275
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,994
So, how would a princess
spend her day?

276
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,912
Like any young lady.

277
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,789
In the morning,
she would have lessons.

278
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,958
In the afternoon,
she would visit with friends.

279
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:28,086
And at lunchtime,
she would eat her vegetables.

280
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,130
My father says
that a princess personifies

281
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,716
the decadence
of a vanquished era.

282
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,343
Well, perhaps a few.

283
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,053
Not all, I can assure you.

284
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,681
Don't worry. Papa knows
everything there is to know

285
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,391
about the workings of a tractor,

286
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:45,395
but absolutely nothing about
the workings of a princess.

287
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,487
Have you ever been in a duel?

288
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,658
Not exactly.

289
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,832
But my godfather
was a second

290
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,626
on more than one occasion.

291
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,918
- A second?
- When two gentlemen

292
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,880
agree to duel,
they each appoint seconds,

293
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,133
lieutenants who settle upon
the rules of engagement.

294
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,302
What sort of rules
of engagement?

295
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,721
The time, the place,
what weapons will be used.

296
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:23,516
If it's pistols, how many paces.

297
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,102
One of the duels
my godfather seconded

298
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,104
sprang from a dispute
that occurred

299
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:32,942
in this very hotel,
between an admiral and a prince

300
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:36,237
whose differences came to a head
one night in the lobby.

301
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,073
Were they in love
with the same woman?

302
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,741
I don't think a woman
was involved.

303
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,785
A woman is always involved.

304
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,913
Yes, well, whatever the cause,
at the time,

305
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,041
the hotel was managed
by a fellow named Keffler.

306
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,709
And it was well known
that he kept

307
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:53,129
a pair of antique pistols
in his office behind a painting,

308
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,590
so that if a challenge
was accepted,

309
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,925
carriages could be summoned,

310
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,053
and parties could be
whisked away, weapons in hand.

311
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,180
In the hours before dawn?

312
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,183
To a secluded spot.

313
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:11,815
The reality, I'm afraid,
was not quite as romantic.

314
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,525
Hmm.

315
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,746
The hotel manager would like
to speak to you.

316
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:30,250
What? Might I finish
my lunch first?

317
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,751
Of course.

318
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,054
Thank you.

319
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,034
I appreciate your stopping by.

320
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,286
It's my pleasure.

321
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,329
It's been brought
to my attention

322
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,541
that certain members
of the staff, uh,

323
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,834
when addressing you,

324
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,920
h-have continued
to make use of certain...

325
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,091
um... amplifications.

326
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,051
Amplifications?

327
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:24,637
Yeah, "Your Excellency,"
and what have you.

328
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,306
Ah. Yes.

329
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,725
- I suppose they have.
- Hmm.

330
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:33,730
Well, if it, you know,
if it were up to me, um,

331
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,690
you know, naturally enough...

332
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,525
well, you know,
goes without saying,

333
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,486
but what with...

334
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,574
Uh, honorifics were
elegant things in their day,

335
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:49,162
but they, uh, they do seem to
have outlived their usefulness.

336
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:53,208
It is the business of times
to change, Mr. Halecki.

337
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,503
And gentlemen
to change with them.

338
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,046
Quite.

339
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:03,760
Might I ask who brought this
to your attention?

340
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,807
You know why
they allow this hotel

341
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,059
to continue operating,

342
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:14,020
serving the clientele
that it does?

343
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,524
So that everyone can be watched.

344
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:21,110
So they can find those disloyal
to the party.

345
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,655
It's been that way
since the Revolution.

346
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,782
It's only gonna get worse.

347
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,659
This hotel is a dangerous place.

348

351

with one of our guests.

352
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,250
My apologies to you both,

353
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,837
but if I could see you
for a moment...

354
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,673
Very well.

- He's working.

Oh, I am sorry to hear that.

401
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,266
It's important to remember that
there are rooms behind rooms

402
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,809

00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,109
This is the perfect place

Most certainly.

Her name's Marina.

420
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,865
Every day she collects
leftover food,

421
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,159

495
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:51,642

pavement a few seconds later.</i>

497
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:59,483
<i>And I would not be alive
to tell this tale.</i>
