1
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,340
中歐

00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,750
“五號礦井屠夫”受害者家屬譴責暴力

3
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,000
－他怎么了 －沒事
- What's wrong with him? - Nothing.

4
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,840
我們只是給他注射了鎮定劑
Just gave him something to calm him down.

5
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,050
等藥效過了呢 會有危險嗎
But when it wears off, he's not dangerous, is he?

6
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,340
－那就不歸我管了 －該死
- That's your problem now. - Fuck.

7
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,550
好吧 帶他進來
All right, bring him in.

8
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,180
快點 她要開始演講了
Come on. She's about to give her speech.

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,310
－你叫什么來著 下士 －祖巴克
What's your name again, Corporal? Zubak.

10
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,400
硬元音
Hard vowels.

11
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,940
像是要吐了
Regurgitative, that.

12
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,240
你的教名是什么
What's your Christian name?

13
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,570
－赫伯特 －赫伯特
- Herbert. - Herbert?

14
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,290
赫伯特祖巴克 念起來真拗口
Herbert Zubak, just trips off the tongue.

15
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,540
有點亂 你別介意
Pardon the mess.

16
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,170
都怪該死的建筑工
Fuckin' builders.

17
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,460
我可以把他們全殺了 你有什么建議嗎
Suppose I could just shoot them all if you have any tips.

18
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,090
你好 親愛的
Hello, my dear.

19
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,430
別擔心這股氨水味
Don't worry about the ammonia smell.

20
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,560
這是幾個月來第三次消毒了
They're sanitizing for the third time in as many months.

21
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,520
你以為這是看房日嗎
What the fuck you think this is? An open house?

22
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,480
快去樓下找你的建筑隊
Go and find your team downstairs.

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,190
可怕的高個女人是財政部長蘇珊戈恩
The tall, scary woman is Susan Goin, Minister of Finance.

24
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,400
毛茸茸的矮個男人 是首相的私人醫生 科肖醫生
The short, furry man is Dr. Kershaw the Chancellor's personal physician.

25
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,450
給他穿上外套
Put his jacket on.

26
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,740
天哪 他像一匹拉犁的馬
Christ, he's a plow horse.

27
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,000
這家伙撐不過一周
This one won't last a week.

28
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,500
好了 坐吧
Okay, sit.

29
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,130
好
All right.

30
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,170
你好
Hello in there.

31
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,880
能聽見嗎
Are you with us?

32
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,760
我先說清楚 我曾強烈反對選擇你
I should tell you I vehemently opposed your selection.

33
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,350
你用你開槍的手指給我們惹了大麻煩
You and your trigger finger made quite a fucking mess for us.

34
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,350
但是首相非要你來 所以就你了
But the Chancellor insisted, so... here you are.

35
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,650
－他簽字了吧 艾格尼絲 －是的 簽過了
And he's signed everything, has he, Agnes? Yeah, yeah, earlier.

36
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,570
很好
Good. Good!

37
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,950
我們從哪里開始呢
So, where to begin?

38
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,780
濕氣怎么樣
I suppose... moisture, yes?

39
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,120
－什么 －你能仔細聽我說嗎
- Sorry? - Can you listen, please?

40
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,000
你知道多少
How much do you know?

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,670
你到底有沒有聽我說話
Sorry, are you hearing me?

42
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,710
我只知道我被調職了
I only know I'm reassigned.

43
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,710
好吧
Right.

44
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,880
該死
Fuck.

45
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,180
目前的情況是我們遇到一個麻煩
Well, the situation is, we have a problem.

46
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,930
－也就是孢子 －孢子
- Namely, spores. - Spores.

47
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,350
－孢子 －黑色葡萄狀穗霉
- Spores? - Stachybotrys atra.

48
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,310
－霉菌毒素 －非常危險的過敏原
- Mycotoxins. - Quite dangerous allergens.

49
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,640
是首相發現的
The Chancellor spotted them.

50
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,230
她以前做過醫生 記得嗎
She was a physician herself once, remember?

51
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,360
－這讓我們十分憂慮 －沒錯
- But it's a very serious concern. - Very much so.

52
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,150
但是毋庸置疑 我們正在控制這個問題
But we're containing the problem, of course.

53
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,820
對 不對
Yes. Yeah. Well, no...

54
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,950
我們只是在努力控制問題
We're working on containing the problem as such.

55
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,290
所以我們要翻新首相府 拆掉內飾
Hence the renovation of the Palace.

56
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,000
徹底清理干凈
Tearing out the guts scraping it clean, so on.

57
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,080
但你能明白問題的嚴重性
But you understand the gravity of the problem,

58
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,460
對吧 祖巴克下士
Corporal Zubak, yes?

59
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,920
你明白這對首相來說是個大問題嗎
And you comprehend that the problem is real for the Chancellor?

60
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,300
她有危險
She's in danger?

61
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,010
相當危險
Well, quite great danger, yes.

62
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,680
但是沒關系 我們正在解決問題
But, no, we're sorting it.

63
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,690
你要和首相見一面 準備好了嗎
So you'll have a chat with the Chancellor, yes? Ready?

64
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,770
－現在嗎 －沒錯
- Now? - Now, yes.

65
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,650
很好 那就開始吧
Good. Come on, then.

66
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,570
千萬不要朝她的方向呼吸
Never breathe in her direction.

67
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,360
保持冷靜
Stay calm.

68
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,900
不要嘔吐
Don't vomit.

69
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,420
進來
Enter.

70
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,010
首相女士 這是祖巴克下士
Corporal Zubak, Madam Chancellor.

71
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,140
知道了
Yes.

72
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,140
謝謝你 蘇珊
Thank you, Susan.

73
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,350
抱歉 這是必要的安全措施
Sorry for all the security measures.

74
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,980
－你沒事吧 －沒事 首長
Are you all right? Yes, Chief.

75
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,440
真的沒事嗎
Are you sure?

76
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,490
為了我的安危 他們還真是煞費苦心
They can be so overcautious on my behalf.

77
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,160
別管這些人 他們只是在做準備
And don't worry about these people. They're just setting up.

78
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,290
－聽說你來自韋斯特蓋特 －是的 首長
So you're from Westgate, I hear. Yes, Chief.

79
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,160
甜菜之鄉 美不勝收
Land of the sugar beet. Stunning place.

80
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,500
過獎了 首長
Not so much, Chief.

81
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,790
你的父母呢
And your parents?

82
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,540
都過世了
They are dead.

83
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,960
我的也是 你們先退下
Mine too. Leave us.

84
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,340
坐
Sit.

85
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,890
我不想顯得太唐突
Now, I don't wish to be indelicate

86
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,190
但你知道我為何選你擔此重任嗎
but do you know why I selected you for this job?

87
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,560
不知道 首長
No, Chief.

88
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,480
我想要一名來自五號礦井的軍人
I wanted a Site Five boy.

89
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,570
不必羞愧
No, no, don't be ashamed.

90
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,530
那些抗議者就像野獸一樣
They behaved like animals, those protesters.

91
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,740
你們軍人只是做出了本能反應
You soldiers just reacted.

92
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,910
不管批評我的人怎么說
I was right to send you boys down that mine

93
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,870
我派你們去那個礦井是對的
in spite of what my critics say.

94
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,460
他們稱呼你們的方式太過分了 五號礦井屠夫
Not nice what they're calling you. Butchers of Site Five.

95
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,710
但是沒關系 我知道真相
But it's all right. I know the truth.

96
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,800
礦井里有個好人值得被愛
There's a good man in there who deserves love.

97
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,720
謝謝首長
Thank you, Chief.

98
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,140
你知道最奇怪的是什么嗎 我覺得我們見過
D'you know it's the oddest thing? I feel like we've met before.

99
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,390
有點似曾相識的感覺
A déjà vu thing or something.

100
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,480
或者我們在夢里見過
Or like we met in a dream.

101
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,360
有嗎
Have we?

102
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,860
應該沒有 首長
I don't think so, Chief.

103
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,740
他們為你解釋過工作內容吧
So, they've explained the job, then?

104
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,360
沒有 首長
No, Chief.

105
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,660
好吧
Well, fine.

106
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,030
沒有最好
Better they haven't.

107
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,160
相信我 所謂的專家 還不如我們普通人知道得多 起來
Trust me, the so-called experts know less than the common shits like us. Up.

108
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,920
這是液體比重計 可以測量空氣的濕度
Right. This is a hygrometer. It measures humidity in the air.

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,460
它能幫你判斷附近是否有霉菌
It helps you to tell me if there's mold nearby.

110
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,180
你要貼身隨行 幫我測量空氣濕度 明白嗎
We'll need you to follow me everywhere and take measurements, do you understand?

111
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,050
－明白 首長 －很好
- Yes, I think so, Chief. - Good.

112
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,680
我覺得我們很合適 你說呢
I'd say we're just about meant for each other wouldn't you?

113
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,390
你可以走了
Let's have you leave now.

114
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,770
謝謝 首長
Thank you.

115
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,020
下士……
Now, Corporal...

116
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,400
做人要有風度
a graceful mind.

117
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,360
你必須努力保持你的風度
You must strive to have a graceful mind.

118
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,870
我會努力的 首長
Yes, I will try, Chief.

119
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,990
謝謝
Thank you.

120
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,120
好
Yeah.

121
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,910
很好 應該沒有別的事了
Good. That should be all then.

122
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,040
不 我們從來不握手
Oh, no... We don't do that.

123
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,460
而且你必須強烈勸阻任何人
In fact, you must quite strongly dissuade anyone

124
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,170
用手接觸首相
from hand contact with the Chancellor.

125
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,460
明白嗎
Do you understand?

126
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,090
這一點非常重要
This is very important.

127
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,760
祝你工作順利 屠夫
Well, lucky fucking break, Butcher.

128
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,220
我們走
Let's go.

129
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,690
他們說清理首相府可能需要幾年時間
They say cleansin' the Palace may take years.

130
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,020
老天爺
God help us.

131
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,570
我們到了
Well, here we are.

132
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,280
這是你的新家
Your new home.

133
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,080
你明天一早就上班
You'll start first thing in the morning.

134
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,620
今晚你要記住 首相府的平面圖和明天的日程
Tonight, you'll memorize the floor plan and a schedule for tomorrow.

135
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,000
我們會派人去取你的行李
I'll have someone get your things.

136
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,050
你有行李嗎
Have you got things?

137
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,590
你聽著
Hey, you.

138
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,510
這些年來 我一直在打理這個破地方 別把它弄臟了
I've cared for this slag heap my whole life so don't go soilin' it.

139
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,560
買點保濕霜吧
And invest in some moisturizer

140
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,850
畢竟除濕劑會讓你的皮膚 變得像木乃伊的屁眼那么干
'cause the dehumidifiers turn your skin to a mummy's asshole.

141
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,880
夢里見

142
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,760
首相向全國發表講話

143
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,600
七年前的明天
Seven years ago tomorrow

144
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,730
我們在一場自由公正的選舉中 擊敗了愛德華凱普林格首相
we defeated Chancellor Edward Keplinger and his bandit radicals

145
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,270
和他那群強盜式的激進分子
in a free and fair election.

146
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,530
我們慶祝的是那場勝利
It is this victory that we celebrate.

147
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,280
當初我懷著沉重的心情 坐上了首相之位
When I became your Chancellor I did so with a heavy heart.

148
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,330
我知道改變這個國家千瘡百孔的模樣
I knew the hard work of smashing the failed state

149
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,250
會耗盡我的時間
would devour my time

150
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,910
會阻止我去你們身邊
and would prevent me from being next to you

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,580
握住你們的手
with your hand in mine.

152
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:53,130
但是 你們給了我無窮無盡的愛
But just know you fill me with all the love I'll ever need.

153
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,880
所以 我祝福你們所有人
And so, I bless you all.

154
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,800
也祝福我們的愛
And I bless our love,

155
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,010
直到永遠
always.

156
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,270
歐洲

157
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,800
政        權

158
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,800

本WEB版外掛字幕由  風吹來的那片云  雙語合并

160
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,950
喂
Hello?

161
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,330
起床吧
Get up.

162
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,250
你有20分鐘
You have 20 minutes.

163
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,210
勝利日快樂 屠夫
Happy Victory Day, Butcher.

164
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,890
勝利日快樂 赫比
Happy Victory Day, Herbie.

165
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,520
走吧
Let's go.

166
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,560
－你記住平面圖了嗎 －應該是吧
- Did you get the floor plan down? - I think so, yes.

167
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,230
她討厭沒把握的態度
She hates doubt.

168
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:19,400
混蛋 你要地圖嗎 去找你的組員
Do you need a mop, you prick? Go and find your section crew.

169
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,360
說到呼吸 她經過你身邊時你憋氣 她跟你說話時你捂嘴
Breathing. If she passes ya, hold it in. If she talks to you, cover your mouth.

170
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,530
多吃口香糖
Hit your mints often.

171
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,780
如果她聞到了霉味 你就說你也聞到了
If she smells mold tell her you smell it too.

172
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,490
她怎么樣
How'd she do?

173
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,540
她說這根香腸像狒狒的老二
She said the sausage looked like a baboon's cock.

174
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,170
讓廚師們吃掉嗎
Mind if the cooks eat it?

175
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,130
好吧 別讓守衛看到
Fine, yeah. Don't let the guards see.

176
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,380
她的心情如何
What's her mood?

177
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,550
十分里面打五分吧
Five out of ten.

178
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,090
十分是好的意思嗎
With a ten being good?

179
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,510
反正是五分 還分什么好壞
Does it matter if it's five?

180
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,760
來吧 靠墻站好
Come and stand against this wall.

181
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,810
來
Come on.

182
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,150
嘿
Hey,

183
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,820
任務很簡單
it's dead simple.

184
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,780
你和她一起走 然后測量相對濕度
You walk with her and you measure the relative humidity.

185
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,320
這個數字是什么意思
What does this number mean?

186
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,070
意思是別問了 機靈點
It means, Don't ask questions and look sharp

187
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,830
否則你的下場會和上一個一樣
or you'll end up like the last one.

188
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,040
打開門 走在我前面
Open the door and walk in front of me.

189
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,050
－情況如何 －非常好 首長
- How are we? - Very good, Chief.

190
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,430
不 親愛的 我問的是濕度如何
No, my dear. How's our moisture?

191
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,180
百分之31
It's 31%.

192
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,180
先去玻璃溫室 和安全局局長拉斯金先生見一面
Glasshouse first with Mr. Laskin Head of Security Service.

193
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,520
今天 你會喝到一鍋屎湯
Today, you'll encounter a soup tureen of worms

194
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,730
名為官僚主義
known as the bureaucracy.

195
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:36,850
做好準備
Prepare yourself.

196
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,980
勝利日快樂 首相女士
Happy Victory Day, Madam.

197
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,070
百分之41
It's 41%.

198
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,370
在這個美好的清晨 我要向您匯報情報了
Here's our intelligence on this glorious morning.

199
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,200
我在規劃辦公室的線人
My sources in the planning office suspect

200
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,790
懷疑財政部長戈恩已經等不及
Finance Minister Goin's patience is running thin

201
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,590
想讓您跟美國完成鈷礦合作了
waiting for you to finalize the cobalt partnership with the US.

202
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,590
如果您選擇繼續交易
Should you choose to proceed with the deal

203
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:08,180
我聽說美國人因為五號礦井的鬧劇
I'm told the Americans may require additional reassurance

204
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,970
可能需要額外的保證
due to the Site Five unseemliness.

205
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,350
我來說說府內的情報吧
On Palace intel, then.

206
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,150
樓下有人在議論您的胃口
Some chatter downstairs about your appetite.

207
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,650
對了 提醒您一下
And... Oh, a reminder.

208
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,320
您丈夫今天要接受《時尚》雜志采訪
Your husband's sitting with Vogue today.

209
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,070
我們是不是該監視一下
I assume we should surveil?

210
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,120
女士
Madam.

211
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,250
今天感覺好點了嗎
Feeling better today?

212
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,410
是的 首長
Yes, Chief.

213
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,250
你更有風度了
Your mind is more graceful?

214
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,540
應該是吧
I think so, yes.

215
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,050
我們昨晚在哪里來著
I wonder, where were we last night?

216
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,170
什么
I'm sorry?

217
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
我們見面的地方在哪里
That place we met, where was it?

218
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,930
昨晚
Last night?

219
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,310
對 親愛的 在夢里
Yes, my love. Our dream.

220
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,850
你不記得了嗎
Don't you remember?

221
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,110
甜菜
Sugar beets.

222
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,650
對 沒錯
Yes, that's right.

223
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,030
甜菜
Sugar beets.

224
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,610
很漂亮吧
Lovely, weren't they?

225
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,700
她正在上樓
She's on her way up.

226
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,160
禮服呢
Dress?

227
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,290
綠色的
Green.

228
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,630
非得是綠色嗎
Had to be green, didn't it?

229
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,670
你竟然害怕布料染劑
Are you scared of a fabric dye?

230
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,050
施夫先生 你真是個窩囊廢
You really are a mewling vulva, Mr. Schiff.

231
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,130
不然呢
Well, what do you expect?

232
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,090
這幾個月來 她連看都不看我一眼
She hasn't so much as glanced at me in months.

233
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,220
那是你的福氣
Well, consider yourself fortunate.

234
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,680
畢竟位高權重的人首當其沖
The right hand gets the smack.

235
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,980
你有沒有發現她最近冷落了
You notice how she's cooling on her favorite

236
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,980
她最愛的縮減GDP部長
Our Lady of the Shrinking GDP?

237
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,110
嫉妒會滋生自我懷疑 辛格先生
Jealousy is bred in self-doubt, Mr. Singer.

238
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,950
天哪

239
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,320
好吧 開始了

240
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,990
他像一只使用計算器的狗
It's like a dog using a calculator.

241
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,240
請她進來 屠夫
Well, see her in, Butcher.

242
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,790
口香糖 各位 呼吸短促點 閉上嘴
Mints, everyone. Short breaths. Mouths closed.

243
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,000
勝利日快樂 首相女士
Happy Victory Day, Madam.

244
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,340
勝利日快樂 首相女士
Happy Victory Day, Ma'am.

245
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,090
勝利日快樂 首相女士
Happy Victory Day, Madam.

246
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,720
我們快點開始吧
Let's get on with it, please, yes?

247
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,550
這些簡報應該更簡短一些
These need to be briefer, these briefings.

248
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,930
令人陶醉
Oh, ravishing.

249
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,350
我是說 這束鮮花令人陶醉
I... I mean, the flowers are... ravishing.

250
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,060
沒錯
Right. Yes.

251
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,480
先討論德克薩斯人吧
So, the Texans.

252
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,360
－拜康公司 －對
- BioCon. - Yes.

253
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,240
首席執行官理查德凱澤今晚將攜妻子
Richard Kaiser, the CEO will be at your table tonight with his wife.

254
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,450
與您同桌共進晚餐
And as you know

255
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,610
如您所知
it would be ideal

256
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:38,160
如果能著手完成鈷礦交易 那就完美了
if we could move towards closing the cobalt deal.

257
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,410
你認為我在拖延時間
You think I'm dragging my heels.

258
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,160
－是嗎 蘇珊 －不 首相女士 當然不是
Is that it, Susan? No, no, Madam. No, of course not.

259
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,540
－你就是這么想的 直說吧 －女士 您也知道
Well, you do think it. Say it plainly. Well, as you know, Madam,

260
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,670
我們急需投資
we are in dire need of investment

261
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,840
而且我不說您也知道 您曾經完全贊成這筆交易
and well... Well, I needn't remind you that you once fully endorsed this deal.

262
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,390
或許我改變主意了
Well, perhaps my thinking's changed, hm?

263
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,140
你沒意見吧 你的小腦瓜不會介意吧
Is that all right with you? It doesn't tread on your little tootsies, does it?

264
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,600
不會 但隨著經濟指數放緩 我們的確需要找其他……
No, but with our economic indices slowing we do need to find some other...

265
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,350
又是該死的政治形象 我可不是什么情婦
It's the fucking optics. Like I'm a fucking kept woman.

266
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,070
干不出把鈷礦開采權 授予外國強國的勾當
Granting cobalt mining rights to a foreign power.

267
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,900
－那顯得太弱勢 －沒錯 女士
I look fucking weak. I agree, Ma'am.

268
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,570
我們一直在宣揚 國家要實現更大程度的自給自足
We've always messaged greater national self-sufficiency

269
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,370
讓美國將我們的資源 用在他們的特斯拉和筆記本電腦上
and letting America use our resources for their Teslas and laptops

270
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,120
與目標背道而馳 對吧
well, it's hardly that, now is it?

271
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,160
我尊重辛格先生 在宣傳方面的專業知識
With respect to Mr. Singer's comms expertise

272
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,040
但人民想要增長
the people want growth.

273
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,380
蘇珊 你居然知道人民的需求
And you know what the people want, do you, Susan?

274
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,840
你在你的鄉間別墅里 能聽到他們哼哼嗎
You can hear them grunting from your country house?

275
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,380
女士 拋開事實和數據
Madam, set aside the facts and figures.

276
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,340
真正的問題是 我們越早完成這筆交易
The real issue is the sooner we close this deal

277
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,970
就能越早投入到最重要的事上
the sooner we can truly invest in our top priorities.

278
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,350
比如保證首相府的安全
Like making this palace safe

279
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,640
保證您周圍的空氣安全
making the air around you safe

280
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,150
保證您的安全
making you safe.

281
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,730
對
Yes.

282
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,240
好吧
Well...

283
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,280
我看情況決定吧
let's see what happens.

284
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,920
你走前面 快到我前面去
In front. Front, front, in front of me now.

285
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,920
不要太近 保持距離
Not too close. Keep your distance.

286
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,680
進去就要小心了
Be careful in here.

287
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,140
別讓他的爪子到處亂伸
Make sure he keeps his paws to himself.

288
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,180
濕度
Moisture.

289
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,690
百分之21
21%.

290
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,330
收下吧
Here.

291
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,660
約瑟夫彼得維納姆
Trite flowers for Victory Day.

292
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,250
慶祝勝利日的艷俗鮮花

293
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,550
看 爸爸
Look, Daddy

294
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,010
你可能覺得我舉辦慶祝會特別傻
I'm not going to feel foolish for having a celebration

295
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,260
但我不會那么想
if that's what you're thinking.

296
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,010
我知道你一直討厭宴會 但我不討厭 所以沒關系
I know you always hated parties, but I don't so... fine.

297
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,730
而且每個女孩都喜歡 找個借口打扮一番
And every girl likes an excuse to dress up.

298
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,940
人民都愛這場慶祝會
They love it out there.

299
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,230
他們也愛我
Yes, they love me

300
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,360
遠遠超過了他們愛你的程度
much more than they ever loved you.

301
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,150
也許這就是我坐上了首相的位子
Yeah. Perhaps that's why I won the Chancellorship

302
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,950
而你還差得遠的原因吧
and you never came near it.

303
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,700
你想過嗎
Ever thought of that?

304
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,490
真是個蠢老頭
Some silly old husk.

305
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,870
你長斑了
You've got spots now.

306
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:28,910
真是新鮮
That's new.

307
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,040
你居然要有新面貌了
Leopard changing its spots.

308
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,630
聽得懂嗎 非常幽默
Get it? Very funny.

309
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,340
笑死人了
Hilarious. Right.

310
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,300
這樣就好了吧
Is that it? Are we done? Yes?

311
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,430
很好
Good.

312
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,430
祝你快樂
Happy, happy.

313
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,930
請再深呼吸一次
One more deep breath, please.

314
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,900
這周的情況更嚴重了
Oh, no, dear. It's worse this week.

315
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,610
濕度又上升了 我就知道會這樣
Humidity's spiking again. I knew it.

316
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,520
－放松點 女士 －我就知道會這樣
- Try and relax, Madam. - No, I knew it. I knew it.

317
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,940
我沒法放松 到處都是霉菌
I can't relax, can I? When there's mold everywhere.

318
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,570
女士 您也知道
Madam, as you are aware,

319
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,620
您從您父親那里 遺傳的抗胰蛋白酶缺乏癥
with the AAT deficiency that you've inherited from your father

320
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,200
增加了您罹患肺病的風險
you are at high risk of lung disease.

321
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,120
但我向您保證 我們正在盡一切努力……
But I can assure you, we are doing everything in...

322
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,330
還不夠
Not enough.

323
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,420
我還是能聞到每個房間里的腐爛氣味
I can still smell rotten air in every fucking room!

324
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,710
－我的藥 －等一會
- My pills, my pills! - Later.

325
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,250
等到宴會之前再吃
Before the banquet.

326
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,840
氧氣是百分之90 開啟壓力
Oxygen at 90%, under pressure.

327
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,800
開大點
Crank it up!

328
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,020
我們熱愛這本雜志 也熱愛美國
We love the magazine, of course and we love America.

329
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,150
我們的關系一直很緊密
Always been a very strong bond there.

330
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,820
那是肯定的
Oh, absolutely.

331
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:45,370
我本身是法國人 但是埃琳娜在哪 我的家就在哪
I'm French myself although my home is wherever Elena is.

332
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,620
不過 我們總是很樂意 和我們的北約朋友合作
But we're always happy to partner with our NATO friends

333
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,370
他們和我們一樣熱愛自由
who share our love of freedom.

334
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,750
－對 我們可以談談自由嗎 －當然
Right, the subject of freedom? By all means.

335
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,420
國際特赦組織稱您妻子的政府
Amnesty International says your wife's government conducts

336
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:02,380
對普通公民 進行高強度的物理和電子監控
intensive physical and electronic surveillance of private citizens.

337
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,260
這不是時尚雜志該問的問題吧
Sounds a bit chewy for a fashion mag, huh?

338
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,640
他們說的是真的
No, no. It's true.

339
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,020
我們確實高度重視 虛假信息四處傳播的問題
We do take very seriously the spread of disinformation.

340
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,180
從這個意義上說……
So in that sense.

341
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,310
－對 但是…… －但是談不上監視
- Right but in terms of the... - But surveillance?

342
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,520
絕對算不上
No. God, no.

343
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,820
但您承認有一些密切觀察吧
But you admit there is some close observation.

344
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,030
你們國家也有啊
As there is in your country.

345
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,150
但是
But no.

346
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,070
真正的民主不是一夜之間建立的
True democracy doesn't happen overnight.

347
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,160
我們現在比以往任何時候 都更接近民主
And we are closer now than we've ever been.

348
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,000
關于礦井動蕩的報道呢
And as for the reports of unrest in the... in the mines?

349
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,460
對 五號礦井的麻煩
- Oh, yes. - The Site Five trouble.

350
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,210
那只是一起獨立事件
That was an isolated incident.

351
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:42,420
一座的鈷礦出了點棘手的意外
A single cobalt mine where things got a little peppery.

352
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,300
但是請允許我
But if I may

353
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:50,180
把話題轉回我的國家詩歌非政府組織
I would like to steer us back to my national poetry NGO

354
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,390
它……
which with...

355
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,310
你在讓小人打架嗎 親愛的
You're making them fight, sweetheart?

356
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,270
－是的 －很好
- Yes. - Good.

357
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,940
進來
Enter.

358
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,610
這是勝利日晚宴的前菜 女士
The entrée for the Victory dinner, Ma'am.

359
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,360
就這樣吧 謝謝
We're done, thank you.

360
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,490
不要三文魚 沒什么味道
No... No salmon. No, salmon's meek. No.

361
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,660
換掉 我們需要味道濃烈的食物
No, we need robust food.

362
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,160
不要野味 換成羊肉
Meat, no game. Lamb.

363
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,080
你自己去想吧
Yeah, something.

364
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,580
奧斯卡 別玩了
Oh, you'll figure it out. Oskar, stop doing that.

365
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,130
小寶貝 跟你媽媽走 去吃你的癲癇藥
Go along with your mother now, angel and take your epilepsy pills.

366
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,100
我看起來怎么樣
How do I look?

367
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,150
完美
Perfect.

368
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,020
又一場宴會
Another banquet.

369
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,650
讓人精疲力盡
God, it's exhausting.

370
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,410
在這些人面前裝模作樣 為他們的笑話捧場
Wearing my face for these people smiling at their lies

371
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:56,410
啜飲清湯 我恨不能把它倒在他們頭上
slurping on consommé. I'd like to pour it on their fucking skulls.

372
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,120
我也想 首長
Me too, Chief.

373
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,380
－你想嗎 －非常想 首長
You'd like that, would you? Very much, Chief.

374
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,140
你今晚陪我去 好嗎
Well, you'll stick with me tonight, yeah?

375
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,470
監控濕度 別讓臟空氣靠近我 好嗎
Keep the humidity in check and their filthy air away from me, yes?

376
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,810
我任您調遣
I will do everything you want.

377
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,980
很好
Good.

378
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,900
你是個好人
You're a good man.

379
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,110
好孩子
Good boy.

380
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,660
別鬧了
Knock it off.

381
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,420
你在這些桌子底下都放了除濕機吧
You did put dehumidifiers under all these tables, didn't you?

382
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,790
是的 我的元首
Yes, Mein Führer.

383
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,300
等孩子睡著后 我能登門問診嗎
House call later, once the boy's asleep?

384
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,590
今晚不行 醫生
Not tonight, doc.

385
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,090
清理工作太多了
There's too much bloody clean-up.

386
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,590
如你所愿 小貓咪
As you like it, puss.

387
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,260
別再這樣叫我了
Stop calling me that.

388
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,470
嘿
Hey.

389
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:59,100
她到了之后 悄悄告訴她空氣濕度
When she arrives give her the number, discreetly.

390
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,650
如果她驚慌失措 你就護送她去那邊的走廊
And if she has a crisis escort her to that hallway there.

391
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,270
那里有新氧機等著她 但一定要避人耳目
There'll be fresh oxygen machines waiting but be fucking discreet.

392
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,440
好
Okay.

393
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:11,110
凱澤先生 埃米爾是我們國家最頂尖的商人
Mr. Kaiser, Emil's our country's top businessman.

394
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,490
非常可靠
You can trust him.

395
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:16,740
我們的鈷礦基礎設施 很快就會接近業界最高標準
Our cobalt pit infrastructure will soon be near top industry standards.

396
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:21,750
巴托斯先生認為 五號礦井的屠殺是業界最高標準嗎
And would Mr. Bartos call the massacre at Site Five top industry standards?

397
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,880
其實那是夸大其詞
Look, that was all overblown.

398
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,710
只是一些害群之馬
Just some bad apples.

399
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,840
12人死亡
Twelve deaths?

400
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,130
我們能加強新聞管控嗎 別讓白宮
Can we just improve the visuals, please?

401
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,130
在《華盛頓郵報》上 看到曠工被殺的新聞好嗎
Can we not have the White House reading about murdered pit diggers in The Washington Post?

402
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,260
當然可以
Of course.

403
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,680
說吧
So, go on, then.

404
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,930
－你為什么那么做 －什么
- Why did you do it? - What?

405
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,350
別想瞞著我 我很快就會知道的
There's no use hiding it from me. I'll find it out soon enough.

406
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
我不知道您在說什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

407
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,730
有人說五號礦井的礦工根本沒有暴動
Well, some say the miners at Site Five weren't rioting at all, you know?

408
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,690
他們只是受夠了有毒的空氣和臟水
They were fed up with the poisoned air and the dirty water

409
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,530
所以他們提出了意見
so they raised their voices.

410
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:58,160
而你們這些軍人 直接在慌亂之下開了槍
And you Army boys just panicked and opened fire.

411
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,080
不過 我想知道
I wonder, though.

412
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,040
你當時也慌了嗎
Did you panic

413
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,540
還是樂在其中
or did you enjoy it?

414
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,800
各位取得勝利的朋友們
My victorious friends

415
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:21,220
回想七年前 腐敗已經蔓延到國家的內部
cast your minds back seven years ago to the rot in our nation's heart.

416
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,180
我們曾是一群支離破碎的人
We were a broken people.

417
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,690
當然 我們知道 是誰把我們變成了那樣
Of course, we know who broke us.

418
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:29,820
前首相愛德華凱普林格
The former Chancellor, Edward Keplinger.

419
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,400
那個叛徒
The Rat

420
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,700
他和新馬克思主義賊黨勾結在一起
and his crony cabal of neo-Marxist thieves.

421
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,030
給我們帶來了絕望
He made us feel hopeless.

422
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,530
直到我們看到了她
That was until we saw her face.

423
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,410
來自林堡的年輕醫生 長著一雙明亮的眼睛
The young doctor from Rinnburg with the brilliant eyes.

424
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:49,290
她將她父親創建的小黨派 變成了一個龐然大物
She took the tiny party her father founded and transformed it into a monster.

425
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,050
她痛擊了凱普林格
She trounced Keplinger!

426
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,930
將他趕回了他的鄉下老家 如今 他還在那里舔傷呢
Ran him off to his country home where he licks his wounds still.

427
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:01,810
各位 和我一起 還有我們的美國新朋友
So, join me. All. Our new American friends, too.

428
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,810
敬埃琳娜維納姆
A toast to Elena Vernham.

429
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,440
敬首相
To the Chancellor!

430
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,770
敬首相
To the Chancellor!

431
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:38,300
很高興見到各位如此光彩照人
Wonderful to see you all looking so magnificent.

432
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,060
真的 我會心碎的
You will. I'll be heartbroken.

433
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,150
別走 我只想讓你留下
No! I just want you to stay.

434
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,740
我的丈夫尼基也這樣想 各位 這是尼古拉斯維納姆
And so does Nicky, my husband. Nicholas Vernham, everybody.

435
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,800
怎么能呢 你在我眼中珍貴無比
How could we ever? You're so precious to me.

436
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,270
沒錯 我們必須繼續走下去
We have. We must carry on forever.

437
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:36,070
我們怎么可能這樣結束
How could we end it all this way?

438
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:41,360
等到明天 我們都會后悔……
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret

439
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,040
不要離開我
Don't you leave me now.

440
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,960
女士們 先生們 謝謝 非常感謝
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. Oh, thank you so much!

441
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,960
看 他們真可愛
Oh, do look. That's sweet.

442
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,010
尼基 快看 親愛的 他們站起來了
Oh, Nicky, look. Darling, they're standing up.

443
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,220
天哪 我要感動哭了
Oh, god, I think I'm going to cry.

444
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,220
－天哪 －你看起來真美
- Goodness. - That was lovely.

445
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,600
－我唱得還行嗎 －很好
Is that all right?

446
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,760
－真的嗎 －真的
- Honestly, are you sure? - Yes, honey.

447
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,100
來吧 深呼吸
Now, come on, deep breaths.

448
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,230
太精彩了 女士
Wonderful, Madam.

449
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,890
謝謝 蘇珊 謝謝
Oh, thank you, thank you, Susan.

450
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,020
太棒了
Thank you. How wonderful.

451
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,190
你們好 謝謝
Hello, thank you.

452
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,570
－天哪 凱澤先生 －凱澤夫人
- My goodness, Mr. Kaiser. - Mrs. Kaiser.

453
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,360
－幸會 －不要接觸 先生
- Pleasure. - No, no touching, sir.

454
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,780
你讓一下……
Excuse me. Excuse me. Thanks. Now... Thank you.

455
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,450
真是幸會 凱澤先生
Such a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Kaiser.

456
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,540
還有您親愛的妻子 凱澤夫人
And your darling wife, Mrs. Kaiser.

457
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,740
您好
- Hello. - Charmed.

458
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,750
幸會 請坐
Please, let's sit. We must.

459
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:34,290
－濕度大約是百分之40 －夠了 非常感謝
- It's about 40% humidity. - That will be all. Thank you so much.

460
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,000
－濕度 －不
- Humidity? - No.

461
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,170
這只是個愚蠢的玩笑
It's just a stupid joke, really.

462
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,340
－我們應該帶雨衣嗎 －不用
Should we have brought raincoats? No.

463
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,350
真對不起 我和妻子都不吃肉
Oh, I'm so sorry. My wife and I don't eat meat,

464
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,600
只吃魚
only fish.

465
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,020
請原諒我們員工的錯誤
Oh, please forgive our staff's mistake.

466
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,230
您和首相是怎么認識的
How did you and the Chancellor meet?

467
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,520
我們在醫學院認識的
We met in medical school

468
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,730
在巴黎的時候
in Paris.

469
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,950
當時我有妻子和孩子 但埃琳娜很有說服力
I had a wife and a baby at the time but Elena is very persuasive.

470
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,950
我想象得到
I can imagine.

471
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,950
只可惜她回去追求政治了
Alas, she went home to pursue politics

472
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,910
所以我回到了妻子和孩子身邊
so I went back to my wife and kid.

473
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,620
后來她認為婚姻有助于她競選成功
And then she thought that marriage would help her campaign

474
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:18,340
所以她讓我求婚 我照做了
so she asked me to propose which I did.

475
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:23,300
我徹底離開了巴黎的家人 從此再也沒見過他們
And I left my family in Paris for good and haven't seen them since.

476
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,890
就這樣 我們過上了幸福的生活
And thus, here we are, happily ever after.

477
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,100
我們非常喜歡巴黎
Well, we do love Paris.

478
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,520
請恕我失陪一下
Will you excuse me for a moment, please?

479
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,310
我能和你談談嗎
May I speak with you?

480
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,280
過來 請吧 過去
Go here, please. Go, go there.

481
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,330
快 沒錯 快過去
Go on. Go on. That's it. Go on in there.

482
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,750
麻煩你看著我
Look at me, please.

483
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,960
你現在滿意了嗎
You happy now? Yes, are you?

484
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,500
他們都把我當成瘋子了
They think I'm a lunatic now.

485
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,460
你簡直是給他們遞刀子
You've handed them all the leverage.

486
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:04,010
你知道嗎 我一個人奔波 為我的國家謀福利
D'you know I am out there by myself hustling, providing for my country

487
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:07,300
你卻讓美國人看我的笑話
and you've made me look ridiculous in front of the Americans.

488
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,800
我不是笑話
I am not ridiculous.

489
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,350
我完全不是笑話 你這個蠢貨
I am very much not ridiculous you stupid cunt.

490
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,470
對不起
I'm sorry.

491
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,020
下次把槍對準你自己
Next time turn your gun on yourself.

492
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,650
塞進你嘴里 你這個不要臉的賤人
Stick it in your mouth you graceless fucking cow.

493
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:36,830
我們應該聊一聊
So... we should talk.

494
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,290
－但是先用餐吧 －當然
- But let's eat first, I think. - Oh, no. Sure.

495
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,500
我之前和您的家人聊過 但是……
I talked to a few of your folks earlier, you know...

496
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,550
現在不是他們了 對吧
Well, you're not talking to my folks now, are you?

497
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,340
您現在要和我聊
You're talking to me.

498
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:52,220
我聽說您的態度很強硬
And I heard you were playing hardball which is fine.

499
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,180
但是沒關系 您在擔心什么
But what are you concerned about, hm?

500
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,730
一點點工人動蕩
Bit of worker unrest?

501
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,730
搖搖晃晃的體制
Some wonky machinery, hm?

502
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,650
那都是細枝末節
It's marginalia.

503
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,980
看看我們的現狀
Look at what we are.

504
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,400
我們是一個年輕的中歐共和國
We are a young, Central European republic

505
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,120
正準備接受一家現代公司的治理
ready to embrace a modern corporate governance.

506
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,240
我們準備與你們一起成長
We're ready to grow, with you.

507
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,290
最重要的是
Here's the important part.

508
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,080
我們熱愛美國
We love America.

509
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,540
我們熱愛我們的友誼
We love our friendship.

510
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,880
一心想要加強與你們的聯系
And we'd love nothing more than to tighten those bonds.

511
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,590
我們有鈷礦
We have the cobalt.

512
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,670
你們支付礦坑和精煉廠的錢
You pay for the pits and the refineries.

513
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,680
這是完美的合作關系
It's a perfect partnership.

514
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:35,180
不然 你們就等著 中國在你們鞋上撒尿時跪舔他們吧
Or you can hold China's cock while they piss all over your shoes

515
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,230
被他們腐敗的供應鏈扣為人質
and hold you hostage to their corrupt supply lines.

516
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:42,810
那好吧
All right, then.

517
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,900
按照約定 我們將拿到采礦權股份的百分之30
30% stake in mining rights as agreed.

518
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,030
很好
Good.

519
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,990
就這么定了
Let's do that then.

520
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:55,780
但我希望您能保證我們達到51
But I would like your assurance of our ability to get to 51.

521
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,790
百分之51
51%.

522
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:02,210
這符合這種交易結構的慣例
Which would, of course, be... de rigueur in a deal structure like this

523
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,670
就是爭取多數股權
to advance to a majority stake.

524
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,920
一直都是這樣的 您盡管放心
Well, that's how it's always done, don't worry.

525
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,210
抱歉 我得先問清楚
Sorry, just to be clear

526
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,840
假如我想把我們的鈷礦另作他用
so if I wanted then to do something with our cobalt

527
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:17,100
還要得到你們的允許嗎
I'd have to ask your permission?

528
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,970
這完全不是問題
It won't be a problem.

529
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,520
我們會非常公正
We'll be more than fair.

530
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,030
別放他進來
Not him.

531
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,530
在這里等著
Wait here.

532
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:44,080
－我不想再看到他的臉 －是 女士

533
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,810
艾格尼絲保住了你的命
Agnes managed to keep you whole.

534
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,560
不然我就要給動物園的獅子送鮮肉了
I would've sent the zoo some fresh lion food.

535
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,400
你已經不是首相的私人水卜師了
So, you're no longer the Chancellor's personal water diviner.

536
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,070
你是宿舍樓層的夜間濕度哨兵
You are now the night moisture sentry for the residence floor.

537
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,320
－你知道那是什么意思嗎 －不知道
- Do you know what that means? - No.

538
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,530
就是說你從午夜到早上六點 都得在走廊上揮舞你那該死的小玩意
It means that you wave your fucking gizmo around these halls from midnight to 6.00am

539
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,290
而且你再也見不到首相了
and you never see the Chancellor's face again.

540
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,870
好好享受吧 屠夫
Enjoy it, Butcher.

541
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,710
我只是想幫忙
I was trying to help.

542
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,380
就像你在五號礦井幫忙一樣
Like you helped at Site Five.

543
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,200
別活了
Just kill yourself.

544
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,700
韋斯特蓋特的垃圾
Westgate trash.

545
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,830
別活了
Just kill yourself!

546
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,290
別活了
Kill... kill yourself!

547
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,460
沒用的東西
Useless beef.

548
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,550
別活了
Just kill yourself.

549
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,670
別活了
Kill yourself!

550
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,720
媽的
Fuck... Fuck!

551
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,580
沒事的
It's all right.

552
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,120
沒事的
It's... it's all right.

553
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,970
我知道
Yes, I know.

554
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,630
我知道你害怕
I know you're scared.

555
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,640
我們兩個可以一起害怕
We can both be scared, hm?

556
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,980
我們會共渡難關的
Yes, we'll... we'll get through this together.

557
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,020
－怎么回事 －我們的立場一致
- What's going... - We come from the same place you and I

558
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:59,900
所以我們會親密無間 親愛的
and that's why we'll be thick as thieves, my love.

559
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,240
首長
Chief!

560
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,260
去死Dead...

561
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,640
去死
Dead!

562
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:30,810
我聞到了他的呼吸
I breathed him... I breathed him!

563
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,270
出去
Out... out!

564
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,190
我聞到了他的呼吸
I breathed him!

565
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,320
放在椅子上
In the chair.

566
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,820
－我聞到了他的呼吸 －把手給我
- I breathed him! Oh, my god! - All right, hon, give me your hands. Give me your hands.

567
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,530
我聞到了他的呼吸
Please! Please help me!

568
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,780
出去
Get out! Out!

569
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,070
救救我
Help me! Help me!

570
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,990
救救我
Help. Help me.

571
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,700
繼續吸
Give your arm. Give your arm.

572
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,970
兩周后

573
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,480
你來這里做什么
What are you doing here?

574
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,980
為了幫他們抓微生物
They needed more scrubby hands for the great microbe hunt.

575
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,440
小貓咪 想我了嗎
Miss me, puss?

576
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:24,450
別再這樣叫我了
Stop calling me that.

577
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,120
外面的人聽到什么消息了
What are people hearing outside?

578
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,370
只有國家新聞上的報道
Only what the state news tells them.

579
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:33,410
首相正在山里享受早就該有的假期
The Chancellor is enjoying a well-deserved holiday in the mountains.

580
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,620
是啊 瘋狂之山
The mountains of fucking madness.

581
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,710
兩周沒有公開露面 人民一定察覺到異樣了
Two weeks without a public appearance. People must know something's up.

582
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,670
那個男孩怎么樣了
How's the boy?

583
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,920
他沒事
Yeah, he's fine, yeah.

584
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,760
他一直在問她在哪
Keeps asking where she is.

585
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,720
那個老姑娘去哪了
Where is the old girl?

586
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,800
天知道 沒人見過她 除了……
Lord knows. Nobody's seen her except...

587
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,890
這個能幫您抵抗病魔
This will help your body to fight.

588
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,060
這是向日葵茶 跟我母親以前煮的一樣
It's sunflower, like my mother used to make.

589
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,870
有解毒之效
It hates poison.

590
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,670
先生
Sir?

591
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,000
我想見她
Yeah, I... I'd like to see her.

592
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,550
她在等您嗎
Is she expecting you?

593
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,800
我是她丈夫
I'm her husband.

594
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,220
她在等您嗎
Is she expecting you?

595
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:15,390
丈夫進入妻子的房間很正常
One expects their husband to enter a room.

596
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,390
沒事的 親愛的
It's all right, my love.

597
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,940
親愛的
My love.

598
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:27,860
你好 尼基
Hello, Nicky.

599
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,080
我很想你 琳妮
I've missed you, Lenny.

600
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:43,540
戈恩部長和科肖醫生 想與你分享一個短期計劃
Minister Goin and Dr. Kershaw wanted to share a plan for the short term.

601
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:47,170
和他們聊聊也無妨
Perhaps it wouldn't hurt to chat?

602
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,340
他長斑了
He's got spots now.

603
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,590
你說什么 親愛的
Sorry, dear?

604
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,220
越來越多的斑
More spots.

605
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,350
你看見了
Have you seen?

606
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,970
誰長斑了 親愛的
Who has, my love?

607
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,430
他
Him,

608
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,940
樓下
downstairs.

609
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,770
在他臉上
On his face.

610
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,190
已經過去一年了 親愛的
It's been a year now, my love.

611
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,990
這很正常
I... I'm sure it's normal.

612
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,110
不
No.

613
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,360
不是給他化妝了嗎
That's what cosmetics are for.

614
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,950
我不該發現那些斑的
I should not have to spot the spots.

615
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:23,670
琳妮 你是不是該放下他了
Lenny, do you suppose... maybe it's time to let him go?

616
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,130
別說了
Stop... Stop it.

617
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:31,090
我已經放下了 別說了
I have. Just... stop that.

618
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,260
你還記得

619
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:38,720
我們在哈辛大街度過的第一晚吧

620
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,100
你直接走到街上

621
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,150
所有的車都停了下來

622
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,860
你想吃什么就吃什么

623
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,610
我當時就被你迷住了

624
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,650
你是那么的無所畏懼

625
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,700
你現在依然如此 親愛的

626
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:01,660
以前的我和現在沒有區別

627
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,630
你只是一直沒看清真正的我

628
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,590
跟他們說 我中午見他們
Tell them I'll meet them at noon.

629
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,390
首相女士 您的氣色不錯
Madam Chancellor, you look well

630
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,940
希望您正在快速復原中
and we hope you're recuperating briskly.

631
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,770
那件事真是令人震驚
It's been quite a shock.

632
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,900
沒錯
Very much so.

633
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,240
過去幾周糟透了
Terrible, terrible few weeks.

634
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,150
那件事令人無法想象
What happened was unthinkable.

635
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,700
這純屬意外 那是個瘋子
A fluke, some lunatic.

636
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,790
聽說是以前的鈷礦工混進了建筑隊
A former cobalt miner turned builder, we've learned.

637
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,540
精神不正常
Very ill in the head.

638
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,580
但我們正在采取一切措施
But every measure is being taken to ensure

639
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,080
杜絕此類事件的發生
that nothing of this nature ever happens again.

640
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,380
徹底杜絕
Absolutely not.

641
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,670
再也不會有了
Never again.

642
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,590
女士 我就不拐彎抹角了
Madam there's no use dancing around it.

643
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:42,180
現在的首相府根本不適合您居住
The Palace, at present, is simply unfit for your habitation.

644
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,680
數據是無可辯駁的
The data is incontrovertible.

645
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,850
我們目前的窘境是
Here's the bind.

646
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,350
我們不能再經歷一次安全漏洞了
We can't risk further security breaches

647
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,310
所以翻新工作必須暫停
and so the renovation has to be put on hold.

648
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,650
必須暫停
No question.

649
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,860
當然 這就意味著……
Which means, of course...

650
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,110
您在墻內檢測到的毒素無法去除
The toxicity you detected in the walls would remain.

651
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,320
這里會變成一個培養皿
You'd be trapped in a petri dish.

652
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,490
所以您只能遷往郊區
Meaning a relocation of sorts to the countryside

653
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,700
這個建議正在等待您的批準
pending your approval.

654
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,790
當然 在您康復期間
Of course, while you recuperate

655
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:08,870
某些政府職能仍需要在這里運作
certain government functions would still need to operate here.

656
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,460
所以我和一些特定的工作人員
And so, myself and a select staff

657
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,880
將留在這里監督這些職能
would remain in the capital to oversee those functions.

658
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,840
只執行重要任務 比如完成鈷礦交易
Vital tasks only, such as finishing the cobalt deal.

659
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:30,230
女士 您父親肺衰竭時 我們無能為力
Madam we weren't able to save your father from his failing lungs

660
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,440
但現在救您還不晚
but it's not too late to save you.

661
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,360
謝謝你們
Thank you both.

662
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,200
你們可以走了
You may go.

663
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,240
好好休息 女士
Rest well, Madam.

664
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,710
下士 坐吧
Corporal, sit.

665
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,180
不
No.

666
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,970
過來 坐我旁邊
Come here. Sit beside me.

667
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:18,530
你知道我為什么叫你來嗎
Do you know why you're here?

668
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,400
不知道
No.

669
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:23,620
因為你是無名小卒 明白嗎
You're here because you are nobody do you understand?

670
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:28,040
這不是侮辱 而是事實
I don't mean that as an insult. I only mean it as a fact.

671
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:32,120
你只是個無名小卒
You are not anybody.

672
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:36,380
所以我可以信任你 對嗎
And that means I can trust you, yes?

673
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,300
是的 首長
Yes, Chief.

674
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:43,510
現在只有你能告訴我
Now, you are the only one

675
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,180
無名小卒想要什么
who can tell me what the nobodies want.

676
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:49,560
看著我
Look at me.

677
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:54,020
你愛我 是不是
You love me, don't you?

678
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,860
－是的 －你能說出來嗎
- Yes. - Can you say it?

679
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,240
我愛您
I love you.

680
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,120
好
Yes.

681
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,200
如果你愛我 就老實地告訴我
Now if you love me tell me honestly

682
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:19,250
你希望接下來發生什么
what would you like to happen next?

683
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,170
告訴我
Tell me.

684
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:30,890
昨晚我夢到您了 而我也出現在了您的夢里
You were in my dream last night and I was in yours.

685
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,770
您讓我干掉一切讓您軟弱的人
And you told me to crush them anyone who makes you weak.

686
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,150
他們挫傷了我們的骨氣 首長
They've cut our balls off, Chief.

687
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,240
而且正在嘲笑我們
And now they are laughing at us

688
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:50,580
因為您像馬戲團里的病熊一樣 為外國的有錢人跳舞
because you dance for foreign cash like a sick fucking bear at the circus.

689
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,870
外面的人都是這么說的
And that's what everybody's saying out there.

690
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,370
您聽不到 但他們就是這么說的 相信我
You don't hear it, but that's what they are saying, trust me.

691
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:59,340
美國把我們當成了他們的殖民地
America treats us as if we are their fucking colony.

692
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,090
他們是怎么做的
So, what do they do?

693
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,260
他們整天往我們身上撒尿
They rain piss on us all day.

694
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,300
他們想讓您垮臺
They want you to fail.

695
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,260
您那個犯賤的財政部長也一樣
And so does your finance bitch.

696
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:12,180
還有那個說您有病的豬頭醫生
And so does your fat pig doctor telling you that you are sick.

697
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,480
您病了 一派胡言
You are sick? That's bullshit!

698
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,560
有些東西是真的
Something, yes, it's true.

699
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,770
這棟建筑里確實有東西會害死您
Something in this building is killing you

700
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,980
但不是這鬼東西
but it's not this shit.

701
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,860
不是這個鬼東西
It's not this shit.

702
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,990
是他們
It's them!

703
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,110
他們希望您 看著我
They want you... Look at me.

704
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,360
他們希望您變成殘廢
They want you crippled

705
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:31,580
因為您有他們永遠沒有的東西
because you have something they will never, ever have.

706
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,870
一個該死的夢想
A fucking dream.

707
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,300
我想徹底打爛他們的臉
I'd love to smash their fucking faces forever.

708
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,850
做人要有風度
A graceful mind.

709
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,820
一 二 三 四 拇指大戰開始啦
One, two, three, four. I declare a thumb war.

710
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,150
用力
Fight...

711
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:05,990
不是吧 你用戰術了
No... That's a tactic!

712
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:07,150
你用戰術了
That was a tactic!

713
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,490
尼基 你看到了嗎
Nicky, did you see that? Let's try again.

714
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:11,160
我們再試一次 看著我的眼睛 我贏定了
Look me in the eye. I'm about to win.

715
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,950
一 二 三 四 拇指大戰開始啦
One, two, three, four. I declare a thumb war.

716
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,410
用力
Fight. Fight!

717
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,580
我贏了
Got you!

718
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,120
好吧 三局兩勝
Okay, best of three.

719
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,500
一 二 三 四 用力
One, two, three, four.

720
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,880
不
Fight...

721
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,670
你太壞了
No, no. You are terrible!

722
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,230
朋友們
My friends

723
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:44,480
幾周前 我國政府的一位高級部長
a few weeks ago, one of my government's top ministers

724
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,900
和我府上的重要隨從
along with key members of my household retinue

725
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,360
勾結有外國勢力支持的間諜
conspired with a foreign-backed fifth column

726
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,870
趁我熟睡時行刺我
to assassinate me while I slept.

727
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,910
放開我
Sir, get off me! Get off me!

728
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:58,870
在過去的一年里 這些人在外國政權的幫助下
For the past year these individuals have weakened our economy

729
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:05,130
削弱了我們的經濟 政府 甚至還有我的免疫系統
our government and even my immune system aided by meddling foreign regimes.

730
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:11,430
因此我要在今天發布一項行政命令 償還我們的債務
Which is why today I am issuing an executive order to repay our debts

731
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:13,640
拒絕美國投資者
turn away American investors

732
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:18,060
讓這個國家擺脫 對北約乳頭的病態依賴
and rid this country of its sick dependence on NATO's teat.

733
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:22,310
全國各地的民眾在本周展示的
My husband and I have been deeply touched by the outpouring

734
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,900
源源不斷的愛和支持 讓我和我丈夫深受感動
of love and support we've seen across the nation this week.

735
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:30,190
這才是我們人民真正的精神
This is the true spirit of our people.

736
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,610
你們是跳動的心臟
You are the beating heart.

737
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,120
你們是萬物的靈魂
You are the soul of everything.

738
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,500
你們是我汲取力量 擊敗敵人的堅強后盾
You are the well from which I draw strength to vanquish our enemies.

739
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:44,250
我不會讓你們卷入美國
I will not let you be sucked into the decadence and toxicity of America

740
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:47,130
及其同黨的墮落和毒害之中
and its surrogates around the globe.

741
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,210
多年來 我們飽受折磨
For years, we have suffered

742
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,130
好讓他們按照自己的形象 建立全球秩序
so they could build the global order in their image.

743
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:56,180
他們為國外的腐敗政權提供物質援助
They've provided material aid to corrupt regimes abroad.

744
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,180
他們犯下了 并教唆別人犯下了大屠殺
They committed and abetted mass murder

745
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,430
他們在地球的每個角落
and they've waged their crony capitalist war

746
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,480
發動了裙帶資本主義戰爭
in every corner of the planet.

747
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,480
還告訴其他國家
They have told the rest of us

748
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:09,980
好好合作 坐直了 聽我們指揮 買路錢自付
Play ball. Sit up straight do as we tell you, and pay the toll.

749
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:13,240
是時候喊停了
It's time to say enough.

750
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:17,660
我們不會再參與他們的殘暴行徑
We will no longer be a party to their legacy of brutality.

751
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:22,080
我們不會再為他們的貪婪受罪
We will no longer suffer for their greed.

752
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:28,920
是時候向美國和全世界 展示我們的價值了
It is time to show America and the world precisely what we are worth.

753
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:36,390
我祝福你們所有人 也祝福我們的愛 直到永遠
I bless you all. And I bless our love, always.

754
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:37,510
待續

755
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,640
謝謝觀賞
