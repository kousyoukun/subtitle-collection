1
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,340
中欧

2
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,750
“五号矿井屠夫”受害者家属谴责暴力

3
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,000
－他怎么了 －没事
- What's wrong with him? - Nothing.

4
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,840
我们只是给他注射了镇定剂
Just gave him something to calm him down.

5
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,050
等药效过了呢 会有危险吗
But when it wears off, he's not dangerous, is he?

6
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,340
－那就不归我管了 －该死
- That's your problem now. - Fuck.

7
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,550
好吧 带他进来
All right, bring him in.

8
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,180
快点 她要开始演讲了
Come on. She's about to give her speech.

9
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,310
－你叫什么来着 下士 －祖巴克
What's your name again, Corporal? Zubak.

10
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,400
硬元音
Hard vowels.

11
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,940
像是要吐了
Regurgitative, that.

12
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,240
你的教名是什么
What's your Christian name?

13
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,570
－赫伯特 －赫伯特
- Herbert. - Herbert?

14
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,290
赫伯特祖巴克 念起来真拗口
Herbert Zubak, just trips off the tongue.

15
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,540
有点乱 你别介意
Pardon the mess.

16
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,170
都怪该死的建筑工
Fuckin' builders.

17
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,460
我可以把他们全杀了 你有什么建议吗
Suppose I could just shoot them all if you have any tips.

18
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,090
你好 亲爱的
Hello, my dear.

19
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,430
别担心这股氨水味
Don't worry about the ammonia smell.

20
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,560
这是几个月来第三次消毒了
They're sanitizing for the third time in as many months.

21
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,520
你以为这是看房日吗
What the fuck you think this is? An open house?

22
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,480
快去楼下找你的建筑队
Go and find your team downstairs.

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,190
可怕的高个女人是财政部长苏珊戈恩
The tall, scary woman is Susan Goin, Minister of Finance.

24
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,400
毛茸茸的矮个男人 是首相的私人医生 科肖医生
The short, furry man is Dr. Kershaw the Chancellor's personal physician.

25
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,450
给他穿上外套
Put his jacket on.

26
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,740
天哪 他像一匹拉犁的马
Christ, he's a plow horse.

27
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,000
这家伙撑不过一周
This one won't last a week.

28
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,500
好了 坐吧
Okay, sit.

29
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,130
好
All right.

30
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,170
你好
Hello in there.

31
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,880
能听见吗
Are you with us?

32
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,760
我先说清楚 我曾强烈反对选择你
I should tell you I vehemently opposed your selection.

33
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,350
你用你开枪的手指给我们惹了大麻烦
You and your trigger finger made quite a fucking mess for us.

34
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,350
但是首相非要你来 所以就你了
But the Chancellor insisted, so... here you are.

35
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,650
－他签字了吧 艾格尼丝 －是的 签过了
And he's signed everything, has he, Agnes? Yeah, yeah, earlier.

36
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,570
很好
Good. Good!

37
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,950
我们从哪里开始呢
So, where to begin?

38
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,780
湿气怎么样
I suppose... moisture, yes?

39
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,120
－什么 －你能仔细听我说吗
- Sorry? - Can you listen, please?

40
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,000
你知道多少
How much do you know?

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,670
你到底有没有听我说话
Sorry, are you hearing me?

42
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,710
我只知道我被调职了
I only know I'm reassigned.

43
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,710
好吧
Right.

44
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,880
该死
Fuck.

45
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,180
目前的情况是我们遇到一个麻烦
Well, the situation is, we have a problem.

46
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,930
－也就是孢子 －孢子
- Namely, spores. - Spores.

47
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,350
－孢子 －黑色葡萄状穗霉
- Spores? - Stachybotrys atra.

48
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,310
－霉菌毒素 －非常危险的过敏原
- Mycotoxins. - Quite dangerous allergens.

49
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,640
是首相发现的
The Chancellor spotted them.

50
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,230
她以前做过医生 记得吗
She was a physician herself once, remember?

51
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,360
－这让我们十分忧虑 －没错
- But it's a very serious concern. - Very much so.

52
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,150
但是毋庸置疑 我们正在控制这个问题
But we're containing the problem, of course.

53
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,820
对 不对
Yes. Yeah. Well, no...

54
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,950
我们只是在努力控制问题
We're working on containing the problem as such.

55
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,290
所以我们要翻新首相府 拆掉内饰
Hence the renovation of the Palace.

56
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,000
彻底清理干净
Tearing out the guts scraping it clean, so on.

57
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,080
但你能明白问题的严重性
But you understand the gravity of the problem,

58
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,460
对吧 祖巴克下士
Corporal Zubak, yes?

59
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,920
你明白这对首相来说是个大问题吗
And you comprehend that the problem is real for the Chancellor?

60
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,300
她有危险
She's in danger?

61
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,010
相当危险
Well, quite great danger, yes.

62
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,680
但是没关系 我们正在解决问题
But, no, we're sorting it.

63
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,690
你要和首相见一面 准备好了吗
So you'll have a chat with the Chancellor, yes? Ready?

64
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,770
－现在吗 －没错
- Now? - Now, yes.

65
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,650
很好 那就开始吧
Good. Come on, then.

66
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,570
千万不要朝她的方向呼吸
Never breathe in her direction.

67
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,360
保持冷静
Stay calm.

68
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,900
不要呕吐
Don't vomit.

69
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,420
进来
Enter.

70
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,010
首相女士 这是祖巴克下士
Corporal Zubak, Madam Chancellor.

71
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,140
知道了
Yes.

72
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,140
谢谢你 苏珊
Thank you, Susan.

73
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,350
抱歉 这是必要的安全措施
Sorry for all the security measures.

74
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,980
－你没事吧 －没事 首长
Are you all right? Yes, Chief.

75
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,440
真的没事吗
Are you sure?

76
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,490
为了我的安危 他们还真是煞费苦心
They can be so overcautious on my behalf.

77
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,160
别管这些人 他们只是在做准备
And don't worry about these people. They're just setting up.

78
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,290
－听说你来自韦斯特盖特 －是的 首长
So you're from Westgate, I hear. Yes, Chief.

79
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,160
甜菜之乡 美不胜收
Land of the sugar beet. Stunning place.

80
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,500
过奖了 首长
Not so much, Chief.

81
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,790
你的父母呢
And your parents?

82
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,540
都过世了
They are dead.

83
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,960
我的也是 你们先退下
Mine too. Leave us.

84
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,340
坐
Sit.

85
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,890
我不想显得太唐突
Now, I don't wish to be indelicate

86
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,190
但你知道我为何选你担此重任吗
but do you know why I selected you for this job?

87
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,560
不知道 首长
No, Chief.

88
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,480
我想要一名来自五号矿井的军人
I wanted a Site Five boy.

89
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,570
不必羞愧
No, no, don't be ashamed.

90
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,530
那些抗议者就像野兽一样
They behaved like animals, those protesters.

91
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,740
你们军人只是做出了本能反应
You soldiers just reacted.

92
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,910
不管批评我的人怎么说
I was right to send you boys down that mine

93
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,870
我派你们去那个矿井是对的
in spite of what my critics say.

94
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,460
他们称呼你们的方式太过分了 五号矿井屠夫
Not nice what they're calling you. Butchers of Site Five.

95
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,710
但是没关系 我知道真相
But it's all right. I know the truth.

96
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,800
矿井里有个好人值得被爱
There's a good man in there who deserves love.

97
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,720
谢谢首长
Thank you, Chief.

98
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,140
你知道最奇怪的是什么吗 我觉得我们见过
D'you know it's the oddest thing? I feel like we've met before.

99
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,390
有点似曾相识的感觉
A déjà vu thing or something.

100
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,480
或者我们在梦里见过
Or like we met in a dream.

101
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,360
有吗
Have we?

102
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,860
应该没有 首长
I don't think so, Chief.

103
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,740
他们为你解释过工作内容吧
So, they've explained the job, then?

104
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,360
没有 首长
No, Chief.

105
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,660
好吧
Well, fine.

106
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,030
没有最好
Better they haven't.

107
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,160
相信我 所谓的专家 还不如我们普通人知道得多 起来
Trust me, the so-called experts know less than the common shits like us. Up.

108
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,920
这是液体比重计 可以测量空气的湿度
Right. This is a hygrometer. It measures humidity in the air.

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,460
它能帮你判断附近是否有霉菌
It helps you to tell me if there's mold nearby.

110
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,180
你要贴身随行 帮我测量空气湿度 明白吗
We'll need you to follow me everywhere and take measurements, do you understand?

111
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,050
－明白 首长 －很好
- Yes, I think so, Chief. - Good.

112
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,680
我觉得我们很合适 你说呢
I'd say we're just about meant for each other wouldn't you?

113
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,390
你可以走了
Let's have you leave now.

114
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,770
谢谢 首长
Thank you.

115
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,020
下士……
Now, Corporal...

116
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,400
做人要有风度
a graceful mind.

117
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,360
你必须努力保持你的风度
You must strive to have a graceful mind.

118
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,870
我会努力的 首长
Yes, I will try, Chief.

119
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,990
谢谢
Thank you.

120
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,120
好
Yeah.

121
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,910
很好 应该没有别的事了
Good. That should be all then.

122
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,040
不 我们从来不握手
Oh, no... We don't do that.

123
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,460
而且你必须强烈劝阻任何人
In fact, you must quite strongly dissuade anyone

124
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,170
用手接触首相
from hand contact with the Chancellor.

125
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,460
明白吗
Do you understand?

126
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,090
这一点非常重要
This is very important.

127
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,760
祝你工作顺利 屠夫
Well, lucky fucking break, Butcher.

128
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,220
我们走
Let's go.

129
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,690
他们说清理首相府可能需要几年时间
They say cleansin' the Palace may take years.

130
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,020
老天爷
God help us.

131
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,570
我们到了
Well, here we are.

132
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,280
这是你的新家
Your new home.

133
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,080
你明天一早就上班
You'll start first thing in the morning.

134
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,620
今晚你要记住 首相府的平面图和明天的日程
Tonight, you'll memorize the floor plan and a schedule for tomorrow.

135
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,000
我们会派人去取你的行李
I'll have someone get your things.

136
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,050
你有行李吗
Have you got things?

137
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,590
你听着
Hey, you.

138
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,510
这些年来 我一直在打理这个破地方 别把它弄脏了
I've cared for this slag heap my whole life so don't go soilin' it.

139
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,560
买点保湿霜吧
And invest in some moisturizer

140
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,850
毕竟除湿剂会让你的皮肤 变得像木乃伊的屁眼那么干
'cause the dehumidifiers turn your skin to a mummy's asshole.

141
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,880
梦里见

142
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,760
首相向全国发表讲话

143
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,600
七年前的明天
Seven years ago tomorrow

144
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,730
我们在一场自由公正的选举中 击败了爱德华凯普林格首相
we defeated Chancellor Edward Keplinger and his bandit radicals

145
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,270
和他那群强盗式的激进分子
in a free and fair election.

146
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,530
我们庆祝的是那场胜利
It is this victory that we celebrate.

147
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,280
当初我怀着沉重的心情 坐上了首相之位
When I became your Chancellor I did so with a heavy heart.

148
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,330
我知道改变这个国家千疮百孔的模样
I knew the hard work of smashing the failed state

149
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,250
会耗尽我的时间
would devour my time

150
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,910
会阻止我去你们身边
and would prevent me from being next to you

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,580
握住你们的手
with your hand in mine.

152
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:53,130
但是 你们给了我无穷无尽的爱
But just know you fill me with all the love I'll ever need.

153
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,880
所以 我祝福你们所有人
And so, I bless you all.

154
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,800
也祝福我们的爱
And I bless our love,

155
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,010
直到永远

161
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,330
起床吧
Get up.

162
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,250
你有20分钟
You have 20 minutes.

163
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,210
胜利日快乐 屠夫
Happy Victory Day, Butcher.

164
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,890
胜利日快乐 赫比
Happy Victory Day, Herbie.

165
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,520
走吧
Let's go.

166
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,560
－你记住平面图了吗 －应该是吧
- Did you get the floor plan down? - I think so, yes.

167
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,230
她讨厌没把握的态度
She hates doubt.

168
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:19,400
混蛋 你要地图吗 去找你的组员
Do you need a mop, you prick? Go and find your section crew.

169
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,360
说到呼吸 她经过你身边时你憋气 她跟你说话时你捂嘴
Breathing. If she passes ya, hold it in. If she talks to you, cover your mouth.

170
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,530
多吃口香糖
Hit your mints often.

171
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,780
如果她闻到了霉味 你就说你也闻到了
If she smells mold tell her you smell it too.

172
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,490
她怎么样
How'd she do?

173
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,540
她说这根香肠像狒狒的老二
She said the sausage looked like a baboon's cock.

174
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,170
让厨师们吃掉吗
Mind if the cooks eat it?

175
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,130
好吧 别让守卫看到
Fine, yeah. Don't let the guards see.

176
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,380
她的心情如何
What's her mood?

177
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,550
十分里面打五分吧
Five out of ten.

178
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,090
十分是好的意思吗
With a ten being good?

179
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,510
反正是五分 还分什么好坏
Does it matter if it's five?

180
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,760
来吧 靠墙站好
Come and stand against this wall.

181
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,810
来
Come on.

182
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,150
嘿
Hey,

183
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,820
任务很简单
it's dead simple.

184
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,780
你和她一起走 然后测量相对湿度
You walk with her and you measure the relative humidity.

185
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,320
这个数字是什么意思
What does this number mean?

186
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,070
意思是别问了 机灵点
It means, Don't ask questions and look sharp

187
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,830
否则你的下场会和上一个一样
or you'll end up like the last one.

188
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,040
打开门 走在我前面
Open the door and walk in front of me.

189
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,050
－情况如何 －非常好 首长
- How are we? - Very good, Chief.

190
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,430
不 亲爱的 我问的是湿度如何
No, my dear. How's our moisture?

191
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,180
百分之31
It's 31%.

192
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,180
先去玻璃温室 和安全局局长拉斯金先生见一面
Glasshouse first with Mr. Laskin Head of Security Service.

193
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,520
今天 你会喝到一锅屎汤
Today, you'll encounter a soup tureen of worms

194
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,730
名为官僚主义
known as the bureaucracy.

195
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:36,850
做好准备
Prepare yourself.

196
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,980
胜利日快乐 首相女士
Happy Victory Day, Madam.

197
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,070
百分之41
It's 41%.

198
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,370
在这个美好的清晨 我要向您汇报情报了
Here's our intelligence on this glorious morning.

199
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,200
我在规划办公室的线人
My sources in the planning office suspect

200
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,790
怀疑财政部长戈恩已经等不及
Finance Minister Goin's patience is running thin

201
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,590
想让您跟美国完成钴矿合作了
waiting for you to finalize the cobalt partnership with the US.

202
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,590
如果您选择继续交易
Should you choose to proceed with the deal

203
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:08,180
我听说美国人因为五号矿井的闹剧
I'm told the Americans may require additional reassurance

204
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,970
可能需要额外的保证
due to the Site Five unseemliness.

205
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,350
我来说说府内的情报吧
On Palace intel, then.

206
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,150
楼下有人在议论您的胃口
Some chatter downstairs about your appetite.

207
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,650
对了 提醒您一下
And... Oh, a reminder.

208
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,320
您丈夫今天要接受《时尚》杂志采访
Your husband's sitting with Vogue today.

209
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,070
我们是不是该监视一下
I assume we should surveil?

210
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,120
女士
Madam.

211
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,250
今天感觉好点了吗
Feeling better today?

212
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,410
是的 首长
Yes, Chief.

213
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,250
你更有风度了
Your mind is more graceful?

214
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,540
应该是吧
I think so, yes.

215
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,050
我们昨晚在哪里来着
I wonder, where were we last night?

216
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,170
什么
I'm sorry?

217
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
我们见面的地方在哪里
That place we met, where was it?

218
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,930
昨晚
Last night?

219
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,310
对 亲爱的 在梦里
Yes, my love. Our dream.

220
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,850
你不记得了吗
Don't you remember?

221
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,110
甜菜
Sugar beets.

222
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,650
对 没错
Yes, that's right.

223
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,030
甜菜
Sugar beets.

224
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,610
很漂亮吧
Lovely, weren't they?

225
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,700
她正在上楼
She's on her way up.

226
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,160
礼服呢
Dress?

227
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,290
绿色的
Green.

228
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,630
非得是绿色吗
Had to be green, didn't it?

229
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,670
你竟然害怕布料染剂
Are you scared of a fabric dye?

230
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,050
施夫先生 你真是个窝囊废
You really are a mewling vulva, Mr. Schiff.

231
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,130
不然呢
Well, what do you expect?

232
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,090
这几个月来 她连看都不看我一眼
She hasn't so much as glanced at me in months.

233
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,220
那是你的福气
Well, consider yourself fortunate.

234
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,680
毕竟位高权重的人首当其冲
The right hand gets the smack.

235
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,980
你有没有发现她最近冷落了
You notice how she's cooling on her favorite

236
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,980
她最爱的缩减GDP部长
Our Lady of the Shrinking GDP?

237
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,110
嫉妒会滋生自我怀疑 辛格先生
Jealousy is bred in self-doubt, Mr. Singer.

238
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,950
天哪

239
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,320
好吧 开始了

240
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,990
他像一只使用计算器的狗
It's like a dog using a calculator.

241
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,240
请她进来 屠夫
Well, see her in, Butcher.

242
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,790
口香糖 各位 呼吸短促点 闭上嘴
Mints, everyone. Short breaths. Mouths closed.

243
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,000
胜利日快乐 首相女士
Happy Victory Day, Madam.

244
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,340
胜利日快乐 首相女士
Happy Victory Day, Ma'am.

245
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,090
胜利日快乐 首相女士
Happy Victory Day, Madam.

246
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,720
我们快点开始吧
Let's get on with it, please, yes?

247
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,550
这些简报应该更简短一些
These need to be briefer, these briefings.

248
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,930
令人陶醉
Oh, ravishing.

249
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,350
我是说 这束鲜花令人陶醉
I... I mean, the flowers are... ravishing.

250
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,060
没错
Right. Yes.

251
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,480
先讨论德克萨斯人吧
So, the Texans.

252
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,360
－拜康公司 －对
- BioCon. - Yes.

253
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,240
首席执行官理查德凯泽今晚将携妻子
Richard Kaiser, the CEO will be at your table tonight with his wife.

254
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,450
与您同桌共进晚餐
And as you know

255
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,610
如您所知
it would be ideal

256
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:38,160
如果能着手完成钴矿交易 那就完美了
if we could move towards closing the cobalt deal.

257
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,410
你认为我在拖延时间
You think I'm dragging my heels.

258
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,160
－是吗 苏珊 －不 首相女士 当然不是
Is that it, Susan? No, no, Madam. No, of course not.

259
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,540
－你就是这么想的 直说吧 －女士 您也知道
Well, you do think it. Say it plainly. Well, as you know, Madam,

260
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,670
我们急需投资
we are in dire need of investment

261
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,840
而且我不说您也知道 您曾经完全赞成这笔交易
and well... Well, I needn't remind you that you once fully endorsed this deal.

262
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,390
或许我改变主意了
Well, perhaps my thinking's changed, hm?

263
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,140
你没意见吧 你的小脑瓜不会介意吧
Is that all right with you? It doesn't tread on your little tootsies, does it?

264
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,600
不会 但随着经济指数放缓 我们的确需要找其他……
No, but with our economic indices slowing we do need to find some other...

265
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,350
又是该死的政治形象 我可不是什么情妇
It's the fucking optics. Like I'm a fucking kept woman.

266
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,070
干不出把钴矿开采权 授予外国强国的勾当
Granting cobalt mining rights to a foreign power.

267
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,900
－那显得太弱势 －没错 女士
I look fucking weak. I agree, Ma'am.

268
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,570
我们一直在宣扬 国家要实现更大程度的自给自足
We've always messaged greater national self-sufficiency

269
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,370
让美国将我们的资源 用在他们的特斯拉和笔记本电脑上
and letting America use our resources for their Teslas and laptops

270
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,120
与目标背道而驰 对吧
well, it's hardly that, now is it?

271
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,160
我尊重辛格先生 在宣传方面的专业知识
With respect to Mr. Singer's comms expertise

272
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,040
但人民想要增长
the people want growth.

273
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,380
苏珊 你居然知道人民的需求
And you know what the people want, do you, Susan?

274
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,840
你在你的乡间别墅里 能听到他们哼哼吗
You can hear them grunting from your country house?

275
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,380
女士 抛开事实和数据
Madam, set aside the facts and figures.

276
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,340
真正的问题是 我们越早完成这笔交易
The real issue is the sooner we close this deal

277
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,970
就能越早投入到最重要的事上
the sooner we can truly invest in our top priorities.

278
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,350
比如保证首相府的安全
Like making this palace safe

279
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,640
保证您周围的空气安全
making the air around you safe

280
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,150
保证您的安全
making you safe.

281
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,730
对
Yes.

282
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,240
好吧
Well...

283
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,280
我看情况决定吧
let's see what happens.

284
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,920
你走前面 快到我前面去
In front. Front, front, in front of me now.

285
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,920
不要太近 保持距离
Not too close. Keep your distance.

286
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,680
进去就要小心了
Be careful in here.

287
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,140
别让他的爪子到处乱伸
Make sure he keeps his paws to himself.

288
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,180
湿度
Moisture.

289
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,690
百分之21
21%.

290
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,330
收下吧
Here.

291
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,660
约瑟夫彼得维纳姆
Trite flowers for Victory Day.

292
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,250
庆祝胜利日的艳俗鲜花

293
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,550
看 爸爸
Look, Daddy

294
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,010
你可能觉得我举办庆祝会特别傻
I'm not going to feel foolish for having a celebration

295
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,260
但我不会那么想
if that's what you're thinking.

296
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,010
我知道你一直讨厌宴会 但我不讨厌 所以没关系
I know you always hated parties, but I don't so... fine.

297
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,730
而且每个女孩都喜欢 找个借口打扮一番
And every girl likes an excuse to dress up.

298
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,940
人民都爱这场庆祝会
They love it out there.

299
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,230
他们也爱我
Yes, they love me

300
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,360
远远超过了他们爱你的程度
much more than they ever loved you.

301
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,150
也许这就是我坐上了首相的位子
Yeah. Perhaps that's why I won the Chancellorship

302
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,950
而你还差得远的原因吧
and you never came near it.

303
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,700
你想过吗
Ever thought of that?

304
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,490
真是个蠢老头
Some silly old husk.

305
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,870
你长斑了
You've got spots now.

306
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:28,910
真是新鲜
That's new.

307
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,040
你居然要有新面貌了
Leopard changing its spots.

308
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,630
听得懂吗 非常幽默
Get it? Very funny.

309
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,340
笑死人了
Hilarious. Right.

310
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,300
这样就好了吧
Is that it? Are we done? Yes?

311
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,430
很好
Good.

312
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,430
祝你快乐
Happy, happy.

313
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,930
请再深呼吸一次
One more deep breath, please.

314
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,900
这周的情况更严重了
Oh, no, dear. It's worse this week.

315
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,610
湿度又上升了 我就知道会这样
Humidity's spiking again. I knew it.

316
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,520
－放松点 女士 －我就知道会这样
- Try and relax, Madam. - No, I knew it. I knew it.

317
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,940
我没法放松 到处都是霉菌
I can't relax, can I? When there's mold everywhere.

318
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,570
女士 您也知道
Madam, as you are aware,

319
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,620
您从您父亲那里 遗传的抗胰蛋白酶缺乏症
with the AAT deficiency that you've inherited from your father

320
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,200
增加了您罹患肺病的风险
you are at high risk of lung disease.

321
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,120
但我向您保证 我们正在尽一切努力……
But I can assure you, we are doing everything in...

322
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,330
还不够
Not enough.

323
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,420
我还是能闻到每个房间里的腐烂气味
I can still smell rotten air in every fucking room!

324
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,710
－我的药 －等一会
- My pills, my pills! - Later.

325
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,250
等到宴会之前再吃
Before the banquet.

326
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,840
氧气是百分之90 开启压力
Oxygen at 90%, under pressure.

327
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,800
开大点
Crank it up!

328
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,020
我们热爱这本杂志 也热爱美国
We love the magazine, of course and we love America.

329
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,150
我们的关系一直很紧密
Always been a very strong bond there.

330
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,820
那是肯定的
Oh, absolutely.

331
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:45,370
我本身是法国人 但是埃琳娜在哪 我的家就在哪
I'm French myself although my home is wherever Elena is.

332
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,620
不过 我们总是很乐意 和我们的北约朋友合作
But we're always happy to partner with our NATO friends

333
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,370
他们和我们一样热爱自由
who share our love of freedom.

334
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,750
－对 我们可以谈谈自由吗 －当然
Right, the subject of freedom? By all means.

335
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,420
国际特赦组织称您妻子的政府
Amnesty International says your wife's government conducts

336
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:02,380
对普通公民 进行高强度的物理和电子监控
intensive physical and electronic surveillance of private citizens.

337
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,260
这不是时尚杂志该问的问题吧
Sounds a bit chewy for a fashion mag, huh?

338
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,640
他们说的是真的
No, no. It's true.

339
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,020
我们确实高度重视 虚假信息四处传播的问题
We do take very seriously the spread of disinformation.

340
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,180
从这个意义上说……
So in that sense.

341
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,310
－对 但是…… －但是谈不上监视
- Right but in terms of the... - But surveillance?

342
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,520
绝对算不上
No. God, no.

343
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,820
但您承认有一些密切观察吧
But you admit there is some close observation.

344
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,030
你们国家也有啊
As there is in your country.

345
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,150
但是
But no.

346
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,070
真正的民主不是一夜之间建立的
True democracy doesn't happen overnight.

347
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,160
我们现在比以往任何时候 都更接近民主
And we are closer now than we've ever been.

348
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,000
关于矿井动荡的报道呢
And as for the reports of unrest in the... in the mines?

349
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,460
对 五号矿井的麻烦
- Oh, yes. - The Site Five trouble.

350
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,210
那只是一起独立事件
That was an isolated incident.

351
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:42,420
一座的钴矿出了点棘手的意外
A single cobalt mine where things got a little peppery.

352
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,300
但是请允许我
But if I may

353
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:50,180
把话题转回我的国家诗歌非政府组织
I would like to steer us back to my national poetry NGO

354
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,390
它……
which with...

355
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,310
你在让小人打架吗 亲爱的
You're making them fight, sweetheart?

356
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,270
－是的 －很好
- Yes. - Good.

357
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,940
进来
Enter.

358
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,610
这是胜利日晚宴的前菜 女士
The entrée for the Victory dinner, Ma'am.

359
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,360
就这样吧 谢谢
We're done, thank you.

360
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,490
不要三文鱼 没什么味道
No... No salmon. No, salmon's meek. No.

361
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,660
换掉 我们需要味道浓烈的食物
No, we need robust food.

362
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,160
不要野味 换成羊肉
Meat, no game. Lamb.

363
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,080
你自己去想吧
Yeah, something.

364
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,580
奥斯卡 别玩了
Oh, you'll figure it out. Oskar, stop doing that.

365
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,130
小宝贝 跟你妈妈走 去吃你的癫痫药
Go along with your mother now, angel and take your epilepsy pills.

366
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,100
我看起来怎么样
How do I look?

367
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,150
完美
Perfect.

368
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,020
又一场宴会
Another banquet.

369
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,650
让人精疲力尽
God, it's exhausting.

370
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,410
在这些人面前装模作样 为他们的笑话捧场
Wearing my face for these people smiling at their lies

371
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:56,410
啜饮清汤 我恨不能把它倒在他们头上
slurping on consommé. I'd like to pour it on their fucking skulls.

372
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,120
我也想 首长
Me too, Chief.

373
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,380
－你想吗 －非常想 首长
You'd like that, would you? Very much, Chief.

374
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,140
你今晚陪我去 好吗
Well, you'll stick with me tonight, yeah?

375
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,470
监控湿度 别让脏空气靠近我 好吗
Keep the humidity in check and their filthy air away from me, yes?

376
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,810
我任您调遣
I will do everything you want.

377
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,980
很好
Good.

378
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,900
你是个好人
You're a good man.

379
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,110
好孩子
Good boy.

380
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,660
别闹了
Knock it off.

381
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,420
你在这些桌子底下都放了除湿机吧
You did put dehumidifiers under all these tables, didn't you?

382
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,790
是的 我的元首
Yes, Mein Führer.

383
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,300
等孩子睡着后 我能登门问诊吗
House call later, once the boy's asleep?

384
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,590
今晚不行 医生
Not tonight, doc.

385
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,090
清理工作太多了
There's too much bloody clean-up.

386
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,590
如你所愿 小猫咪
As you like it, puss.

387
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,260
别再这样叫我了
Stop calling me that.

388
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,470
嘿
Hey.

389
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:59,100
她到了之后 悄悄告诉她空气湿度
When she arrives give her the number, discreetly.

390
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,650
如果她惊慌失措 你就护送她去那边的走廊
And if she has a crisis escort her to that hallway there.

391
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,270
那里有新氧机等着她 但一定要避人耳目
There'll be fresh oxygen machines waiting but be fucking discreet.

392
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,440
好
Okay.

393
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:11,110
凯泽先生 埃米尔是我们国家最顶尖的商人
Mr. Kaiser, Emil's our country's top businessman.

394
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,490
非常可靠
You can trust him.

395
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:16,740
我们的钴矿基础设施 很快就会接近业界最高标准
Our cobalt pit infrastructure will soon be near top industry standards.

396
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:21,750
巴托斯先生认为 五号矿井的屠杀是业界最高标准吗
And would Mr. Bartos call the massacre at Site Five top industry standards?

397
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,880
其实那是夸大其词
Look, that was all overblown.

398
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,710
只是一些害群之马
Just some bad apples.

399
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,840
12人死亡
Twelve deaths?

400
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,130
我们能加强新闻管控吗 别让白宫
Can we just improve the visuals, please?

401
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,130
在《华盛顿邮报》上 看到旷工被杀的新闻好吗
Can we not have the White House reading about murdered pit diggers in The Washington Post?

402
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,260
当然可以
Of course.

403
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,680
说吧
So, go on, then.

404
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,930
－你为什么那么做 －什么
- Why did you do it? - What?

405
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,350
别想瞒着我 我很快就会知道的
There's no use hiding it from me. I'll find it out soon enough.

406
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
我不知道您在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

407
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,730
有人说五号矿井的矿工根本没有暴动
Well, some say the miners at Site Five weren't rioting at all, you know?

408
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,690
他们只是受够了有毒的空气和脏水
They were fed up with the poisoned air and the dirty water

409
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,530
所以他们提出了意见
so they raised their voices.

410
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:58,160
而你们这些军人 直接在慌乱之下开了枪
And you Army boys just panicked and opened fire.

411
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,080
不过 我想知道
I wonder, though.

412
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,040
你当时也慌了吗
Did you panic

413
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,540
还是乐在其中
or did you enjoy it?

414
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,800
各位取得胜利的朋友们
My victorious friends

415
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:21,220
回想七年前 腐败已经蔓延到国家的内部
cast your minds back seven years ago to the rot in our nation's heart.

416
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,180
我们曾是一群支离破碎的人
We were a broken people.

417
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,690
当然 我们知道 是谁把我们变成了那样
Of course, we know who broke us.

418
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:29,820
前首相爱德华凯普林格
The former Chancellor, Edward Keplinger.

419
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,400
那个叛徒
The Rat

420
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,700
他和新马克思主义贼党勾结在一起
and his crony cabal of neo-Marxist thieves.

421
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,030
给我们带来了绝望
He made us feel hopeless.

422
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,530
直到我们看到了她
That was until we saw her face.

423
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,410
来自林堡的年轻医生 长着一双明亮的眼睛
The young doctor from Rinnburg with the brilliant eyes.

424
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:49,290
她将她父亲创建的小党派 变成了一个庞然大物
She took the tiny party her father founded and transformed it into a monster.

425
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,050
她痛击了凯普林格
She trounced Keplinger!

426
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,930
将他赶回了他的乡下老家 如今 他还在那里舔伤呢
Ran him off to his country home where he licks his wounds still.

427
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:01,810
各位 和我一起 还有我们的美国新朋友
So, join me. All. Our new American friends, too.

428
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,810
敬埃琳娜维纳姆
A toast to Elena Vernham.

429
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,440
敬首相
To the Chancellor!

430
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,770
敬首相
To the Chancellor!

431
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:38,300
很高兴见到各位如此光彩照人
Wonderful to see you all looking so magnificent.

432
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,060
真的 我会心碎的
You will. I'll be heartbroken.

433
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,150
别走 我只想让你留下
No! I just want you to stay.

434
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,740
我的丈夫尼基也这样想 各位 这是尼古拉斯维纳姆
And so does Nicky, my husband. Nicholas Vernham, everybody.

435
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,800
怎么能呢 你在我眼中珍贵无比
How could we ever? You're so precious to me.

436
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,270
没错 我们必须继续走下去
We have. We must carry on forever.

437
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:36,070
我们怎么可能这样结束
How could we end it all this way?

438
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:41,360
等到明天 我们都会后悔……
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret

439
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,040
不要离开我
Don't you leave me now.

440
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,960
女士们 先生们 谢谢 非常感谢
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. Oh, thank you so much!

441
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,960
看 他们真可爱
Oh, do look. That's sweet.

442
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,010
尼基 快看 亲爱的 他们站起来了
Oh, Nicky, look. Darling, they're standing up.

443
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,220
天哪 我要感动哭了
Oh, god, I think I'm going to cry.

444
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,220
－天哪 －你看起来真美
- Goodness. - That was lovely.

445
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,600
－我唱得还行吗 －很好
Is that all right?

446
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,760
－真的吗 －真的
- Honestly, are you sure? - Yes, honey.

447
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,100
来吧 深呼吸
Now, come on, deep breaths.

448
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,230
太精彩了 女士
Wonderful, Madam.

449
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,890
谢谢 苏珊 谢谢
Oh, thank you, thank you, Susan.

450
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,020
太棒了
Thank you. How wonderful.

451
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,190
你们好 谢谢
Hello, thank you.

452
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,570
－天哪 凯泽先生 －凯泽夫人
- My goodness, Mr. Kaiser. - Mrs. Kaiser.

453
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,360
－幸会 －不要接触 先生
- Pleasure. - No, no touching, sir.

454
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,780
你让一下……
Excuse me. Excuse me. Thanks. Now... Thank you.

455
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,450
真是幸会 凯泽先生
Such a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Kaiser.

456
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,540
还有您亲爱的妻子 凯泽夫人
And your darling wife, Mrs. Kaiser.

457
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,740
您好
- Hello. - Charmed.

458
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,750
幸会 请坐
Please, let's sit. We must.

459
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:34,290
－湿度大约是百分之40 －够了 非常感谢
- It's about 40% humidity. - That will be all. Thank you so much.

460
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,000
－湿度 －不
- Humidity? - No.

461
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,170
这只是个愚蠢的玩笑
It's just a stupid joke, really.

462
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,340
－我们应该带雨衣吗 －不用
Should we have brought raincoats? No.

463
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,350
真对不起 我和妻子都不吃肉
Oh, I'm so sorry. My wife and I don't eat meat,

464
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,600
只吃鱼
only fish.

465
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,020
请原谅我们员工的错误
Oh, please forgive our staff's mistake.

466
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,230
您和首相是怎么认识的
How did you and the Chancellor meet?

467
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,520
我们在医学院认识的
We met in medical school

468
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,730
在巴黎的时候
in Paris.

469
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,950
当时我有妻子和孩子 但埃琳娜很有说服力
I had a wife and a baby at the time but Elena is very persuasive.

470
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,950
我想象得到
I can imagine.

471
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,950
只可惜她回去追求政治了
Alas, she went home to pursue politics

472
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,910
所以我回到了妻子和孩子身边
so I went back to my wife and kid.

473
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,620
后来她认为婚姻有助于她竞选成功
And then she thought that marriage would help her campaign

474
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:18,340
所以她让我求婚 我照做了
so she asked me to propose which I did.

475
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:23,300
我彻底离开了巴黎的家人 从此再也没见过他们
And I left my family in Paris for good and haven't seen them since.

476
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,890
就这样 我们过上了幸福的生活
And thus, here we are, happily ever after.

477
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,100
我们非常喜欢巴黎
Well, we do love Paris.

478
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,520
请恕我失陪一下
Will you excuse me for a moment, please?

479
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,310
我能和你谈谈吗
May I speak with you?

480
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,280
过来 请吧 过去
Go here, please. Go, go there.

481
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,330
快 没错 快过去
Go on. Go on. That's it. Go on in there.

482
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,750
麻烦你看着我
Look at me, please.

483
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,960
你现在满意了吗
You happy now? Yes, are you?

484
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,500
他们都把我当成疯子了
They think I'm a lunatic now.

485
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,460
你简直是给他们递刀子
You've handed them all the leverage.

486
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:04,010
你知道吗 我一个人奔波 为我的国家谋福利
D'you know I am out there by myself hustling, providing for my country

487
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:07,300
你却让美国人看我的笑话
and you've made me look ridiculous in front of the Americans.

488
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,800
我不是笑话
I am not ridiculous.

489
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,350
我完全不是笑话 你这个蠢货
I am very much not ridiculous you stupid cunt.

490
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,470
对不起
I'm sorry.

491
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,020
下次把枪对准你自己
Next time turn your gun on yourself.

492
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,650
塞进你嘴里 你这个不要脸的贱人
Stick it in your mouth you graceless fucking cow.

493
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:36,830
我们应该聊一聊
So... we should talk.

494
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,290
－但是先用餐吧 －当然
- But let's eat first, I think. - Oh, no. Sure.

495
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,500
我之前和您的家人聊过 但是……
I talked to a few of your folks earlier, you know...

496
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,550
现在不是他们了 对吧
Well, you're not talking to my folks now, are you?

497
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,340
您现在要和我聊
You're talking to me.

498
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:52,220
我听说您的态度很强硬
And I heard you were playing hardball which is fine.

499
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,180
但是没关系 您在担心什么
But what are you concerned about, hm?

500
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,730
一点点工人动荡
Bit of worker unrest?

501
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,730
摇摇晃晃的体制
Some wonky machinery, hm?

502
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,650
那都是细枝末节
It's marginalia.

503
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,980
看看我们的现状
Look at what we are.

504
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,400
我们是一个年轻的中欧共和国
We are a young, Central European republic

505
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,120
正准备接受一家现代公司的治理
ready to embrace a modern corporate governance.

506
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,240
我们准备与你们一起成长
We're ready to grow, with you.

507
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,290
最重要的是
Here's the important part.

508
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,080
我们热爱美国
We love America.

509
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,540
我们热爱我们的友谊
We love our friendship.

510
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,880
一心想要加强与你们的联系
And we'd love nothing more than to tighten those bonds.

511
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,590
我们有钴矿
We have the cobalt.

512
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,670
你们支付矿坑和精炼厂的钱
You pay for the pits and the refineries.

513
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,680
这是完美的合作关系
It's a perfect partnership.

514
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:35,180
不然 你们就等着 中国在你们鞋上撒尿时跪舔他们吧
Or you can hold China's cock while they piss all over your shoes

515
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,230
被他们腐败的供应链扣为人质
and hold you hostage to their corrupt supply lines.

516
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:42,810
那好吧
All right, then.

517
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,900
按照约定 我们将拿到采矿权股份的百分之30
30% stake in mining rights as agreed.

518
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,030
很好
Good.

519
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,990
就这么定了
Let's do that then.

520
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:55,780
但我希望您能保证我们达到51
But I would like your assurance of our ability to get to 51.

521
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,790
百分之51
51%.

522
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:02,210
这符合这种交易结构的惯例
Which would, of course, be... de rigueur in a deal structure like this

523
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,670
就是争取多数股权
to advance to a majority stake.

524
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,920
一直都是这样的 您尽管放心
Well, that's how it's always done, don't worry.

525
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,210
抱歉 我得先问清楚
Sorry, just to be clear

526
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,840
假如我想把我们的钴矿另作他用
so if I wanted then to do something with our cobalt

527
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:17,100
还要得到你们的允许吗
I'd have to ask your permission?

528
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,970
这完全不是问题
It won't be a problem.

529
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,520
我们会非常公正
We'll be more than fair.

530
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,030
别放他进来
Not him.

531
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,530
在这里等着
Wait here.

532
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:44,080
－我不想再看到他的脸 －是 女士

533
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,810
艾格尼丝保住了你的命
Agnes managed to keep you whole.

534
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,560
不然我就要给动物园的狮子送鲜肉了
I would've sent the zoo some fresh lion food.

535
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,400
你已经不是首相的私人水卜师了
So, you're no longer the Chancellor's personal water diviner.

536
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,070
你是宿舍楼层的夜间湿度哨兵
You are now the night moisture sentry for the residence floor.

537
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,320
－你知道那是什么意思吗 －不知道
- Do you know what that means? - No.

538
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,530
就是说你从午夜到早上六点 都得在走廊上挥舞你那该死的小玩意
It means that you wave your fucking gizmo around these halls from midnight to 6.00am

539
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,290
而且你再也见不到首相了
and you never see the Chancellor's face again.

540
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,870
好好享受吧 屠夫
Enjoy it, Butcher.

541
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,710
我只是想帮忙
I was trying to help.

542
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,380
就像你在五号矿井帮忙一样
Like you helped at Site Five.

543
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,200
别活了
Just kill yourself.

544
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,700
韦斯特盖特的垃圾
Westgate trash.

545
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,830
别活了
Just kill yourself!

546
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,290
别活了
Kill... kill yourself!

547
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,460
没用的东西
Useless beef.

548
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,550
别活了
Just kill yourself.

549
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,670
别活了
Kill yourself!

550
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,720
妈的
Fuck... Fuck!

551
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,580
没事的
It's all right.

552
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,120
没事的
It's... it's all right.

553
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,970
我知道
Yes, I know.

554
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,630
我知道你害怕
I know you're scared.

555
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,640
我们两个可以一起害怕
We can both be scared, hm?

556
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,980
我们会共渡难关的
Yes, we'll... we'll get through this together.

557
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,020
－怎么回事 －我们的立场一致
- What's going... - We come from the same place you and I

558
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:59,900
所以我们会亲密无间 亲爱的
and that's why we'll be thick as thieves, my love.

559
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,240
首长
Chief!

560
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,260
去死Dead...

561
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,640
去死
Dead!

562
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:30,810
我闻到了他的呼吸
I breathed him... I breathed him!

563
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,270
出去
Out... out!

564
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,190
我闻到了他的呼吸
I breathed him!

565
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,320
放在椅子上
In the chair.

566
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,820
－我闻到了他的呼吸 －把手给我
- I breathed him! Oh, my god! - All right, hon, give me your hands. Give me your hands.

567
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,530
我闻到了他的呼吸
Please! Please help me!

568
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,780
出去
Get out! Out!

569
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,070
救救我
Help me! Help me!

570
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,990
救救我
Help. Help me.

571
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,700
继续吸
Give your arm. Give your arm.

572
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,970
两周后

573
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,480
你来这里做什么
What are you doing here?

574
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,980
为了帮他们抓微生物
They needed more scrubby hands for the great microbe hunt.

575
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,440
小猫咪 想我了吗
Miss me, puss?

576
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:24,450
别再这样叫我了
Stop calling me that.

577
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,120
外面的人听到什么消息了
What are people hearing outside?

578
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,370
只有国家新闻上的报道
Only what the state news tells them.

579
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:33,410
首相正在山里享受早就该有的假期
The Chancellor is enjoying a well-deserved holiday in the mountains.

580
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,620
是啊 疯狂之山
The mountains of fucking madness.

581
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,710
两周没有公开露面 人民一定察觉到异样了
Two weeks without a public appearance. People must know something's up.

582
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,670
那个男孩怎么样了
How's the boy?

583
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,920
他没事
Yeah, he's fine, yeah.

584
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,760
他一直在问她在哪
Keeps asking where she is.

585
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,720
那个老姑娘去哪了
Where is the old girl?

586
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,800
天知道 没人见过她 除了……
Lord knows. Nobody's seen her except...

587
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,890
这个能帮您抵抗病魔
This will help your body to fight.

588
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,060
这是向日葵茶 跟我母亲以前煮的一样
It's sunflower, like my mother used to make.

589
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,870
有解毒之效
It hates poison.

590
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,670
先生
Sir?

591
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,000
我想见她
Yeah, I... I'd like to see her.

592
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,550
她在等您吗
Is she expecting you?

593
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,800
我是她丈夫
I'm her husband.

594
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,220
她在等您吗
Is she expecting you?

595
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:15,390
丈夫进入妻子的房间很正常
One expects their husband to enter a room.

596
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,390
没事的 亲爱的
It's all right, my love.

597
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,940
亲爱的
My love.

598
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:27,860
你好 尼基
Hello, Nicky.

599
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,080
我很想你 琳妮
I've missed you, Lenny.

600
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:43,540
戈恩部长和科肖医生 想与你分享一个短期计划
Minister Goin and Dr. Kershaw wanted to share a plan for the short term.

601
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:47,170
和他们聊聊也无妨
Perhaps it wouldn't hurt to chat?

602
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,340
他长斑了
He's got spots now.

603
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,590
你说什么 亲爱的
Sorry, dear?

604
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,220
越来越多的斑
More spots.

605
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,350
你看见了
Have you seen?

606
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,970
谁长斑了 亲爱的
Who has, my love?

607
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,430
他
Him,

608
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,940
楼下
downstairs.

609
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,770
在他脸上
On his face.

610
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,190
已经过去一年了 亲爱的
It's been a year now, my love.

611
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,990
这很正常
I... I'm sure it's normal.

612
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,110
不
No.

613
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,360
不是给他化妆了吗
That's what cosmetics are for.

614
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,950
我不该发现那些斑的
I should not have to spot the spots.

615
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:23,670
琳妮 你是不是该放下他了
Lenny, do you suppose... maybe it's time to let him go?

616
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,130
别说了
Stop... Stop it.

617
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:31,090
我已经放下了 别说了
I have. Just... stop that.

618
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,260
你还记得

619
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:38,720
我们在哈辛大街度过的第一晚吧

620
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,100
你直接走到街上

621
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,150
所有的车都停了下来

622
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,860
你想吃什么就吃什么

623
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,610
我当时就被你迷住了

624
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,650
你是那么的无所畏惧

625
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,700
你现在依然如此 亲爱的

626
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:01,660
以前的我和现在没有区别

627
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,630
你只是一直没看清真正的我

628
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,590
跟他们说 我中午见他们
Tell them I'll meet them at noon.

629
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,390
首相女士 您的气色不错
Madam Chancellor, you look well

630
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,940
希望您正在快速复原中
and we hope you're recuperating briskly.

631
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,770
那件事真是令人震惊
It's been quite a shock.

632
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,900
没错
Very much so.

633
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,240
过去几周糟透了
Terrible, terrible few weeks.

634
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,150
那件事令人无法想象
What happened was unthinkable.

635
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,700
这纯属意外 那是个疯子
A fluke, some lunatic.

636
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,790
听说是以前的钴矿工混进了建筑队
A former cobalt miner turned builder, we've learned.

637
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,540
精神不正常
Very ill in the head.

638
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,580
但我们正在采取一切措施
But every measure is being taken to ensure

639
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,080
杜绝此类事件的发生
that nothing of this nature ever happens again.

640
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,380
彻底杜绝
Absolutely not.

641
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,670
再也不会有了
Never again.

642
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,590
女士 我就不拐弯抹角了
Madam there's no use dancing around it.

643
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:42,180
现在的首相府根本不适合您居住
The Palace, at present, is simply unfit for your habitation.

644
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,680
数据是无可辩驳的
The data is incontrovertible.

645
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,850
我们目前的窘境是
Here's the bind.

646
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,350
我们不能再经历一次安全漏洞了
We can't risk further security breaches

647
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,310
所以翻新工作必须暂停
and so the renovation has to be put on hold.

648
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,650
必须暂停
No question.

649
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,860
当然 这就意味着……
Which means, of course...

650
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,110
您在墙内检测到的毒素无法去除
The toxicity you detected in the walls would remain.

651
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,320
这里会变成一个培养皿
You'd be trapped in a petri dish.

652
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,490
所以您只能迁往郊区
Meaning a relocation of sorts to the countryside

653
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,700
这个建议正在等待您的批准
pending your approval.

654
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,790
当然 在您康复期间
Of course, while you recuperate

655
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:08,870
某些政府职能仍需要在这里运作
certain government functions would still need to operate here.

656
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,460
所以我和一些特定的工作人员
And so, myself and a select staff

657
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,880
将留在这里监督这些职能
would remain in the capital to oversee those functions.

658
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,840
只执行重要任务 比如完成钴矿交易
Vital tasks only, such as finishing the cobalt deal.

659
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:30,230
女士 您父亲肺衰竭时 我们无能为力
Madam we weren't able to save your father from his failing lungs

660
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,440
但现在救您还不晚
but it's not too late to save you.

661
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,360
谢谢你们
Thank you both.

662
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,200
你们可以走了
You may go.

663
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,240
好好休息 女士
Rest well, Madam.

664
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,710
下士 坐吧
Corporal, sit.

665
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,180
不
No.

666
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,970
过来 坐我旁边
Come here. Sit beside me.

667
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:18,530
你知道我为什么叫你来吗
Do you know why you're here?

668
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,400
不知道
No.

669
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:23,620
因为你是无名小卒 明白吗
You're here because you are nobody do you understand?

670
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:28,040
这不是侮辱 而是事实
I don't mean that as an insult. I only mean it as a fact.

671
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:32,120
你只是个无名小卒
You are not anybody.

672
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:36,380
所以我可以信任你 对吗
And that means I can trust you, yes?

673
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,300
是的 首长
Yes, Chief.

674
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:43,510
现在只有你能告诉我
Now, you are the only one

675
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,180
无名小卒想要什么
who can tell me what the nobodies want.

676
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:49,560
看着我
Look at me.

677
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:54,020
你爱我 是不是
You love me, don't you?

678
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,860
－是的 －你能说出来吗
- Yes. - Can you say it?

679
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,240
我爱您
I love you.

680
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,120
好
Yes.

681
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,200
如果你爱我 就老实地告诉我
Now if you love me tell me honestly

682
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:19,250
你希望接下来发生什么
what would you like to happen next?

683
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,170
告诉我
Tell me.

684
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:30,890
昨晚我梦到您了 而我也出现在了您的梦里
You were in my dream last night and I was in yours.

685
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,770
您让我干掉一切让您软弱的人
And you told me to crush them anyone who makes you weak.

686
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,150
他们挫伤了我们的骨气 首长
They've cut our balls off, Chief.

687
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,240
而且正在嘲笑我们
And now they are laughing at us

688
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:50,580
因为您像马戏团里的病熊一样 为外国的有钱人跳舞
because you dance for foreign cash like a sick fucking bear at the circus.

689
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,870
外面的人都是这么说的
And that's what everybody's saying out there.

690
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,370
您听不到 但他们就是这么说的 相信我
You don't hear it, but that's what they are saying, trust me.

691
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:59,340
美国把我们当成了他们的殖民地
America treats us as if we are their fucking colony.

692
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,090
他们是怎么做的
So, what do they do?

693
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,260
他们整天往我们身上撒尿
They rain piss on us all day.

694
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,300
他们想让您垮台
They want you to fail.

695
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,260
您那个犯贱的财政部长也一样

696
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:12,180
还有那个说您有病的猪头医生

697
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,480
您病了 一派胡言
You are sick? That's bullshit!

698

有些东西是真的

他们希望您 看着我
They want you... Look at me.

704

他们希望您变成残废
They want you crippled

705
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:31,580
因为您有他们永远没有的东西

706
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,870
一个该死的梦想
A fucking dream.

707
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,300
我想彻底打烂他们的脸
I'd love to smash their fucking faces forever.

708
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,850
做人要有风度
A graceful mind.

709
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,820
一 二 三 四 拇指大战开始啦

Fight...

711
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:05,990
不是吧 你用战术了
No... That's a tactic!

712
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:07,150
你用战术了
That was a tactic!

713
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,490
尼基 你看到了吗
Nicky, did you see that? Let's try again.

714
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:11,160
我们再试一次 看着我的眼睛 我赢定了
Look me in the eye. I'm about to win.

One, two, three, four.

720
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,880
不
Fight...

721
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,670
你太坏了
No, no. You are terrible!

722

几周前 我国政府的一位高级部长
a few weeks ago, one of my government's top ministers

724
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,900
和我府上的重要随从

725
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,360
勾结有外国势力支持的间谍

726
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,870
趁我熟睡时行刺我
to assassinate me while I slept.

727
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,910
放开我
Sir, get off me! Get off me!

728
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:58,870
在过去的一年里 这些人在外国政权的帮助下
For the past year these individuals have weakened our economy

729
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:05,130
削弱了我们的经济 政府 甚至还有我的免疫系统
our government and even my immune system aided by meddling foreign regimes.

730
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:11,430
因此我要在今天发布一项行政命令 偿还我们的债务

733
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:22,310
全国各地的民众在本周展示的

You are the well from which I draw strength to vanquish our enemies.

I will not let you be sucked into the decadence and toxicity of America

740
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:47,130
及其同党的堕落和毒害之中

多年来 我们饱受折磨
For years, we have suffered

742
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,130
好让他们按照自己的形象 建立全球秩序
so they could build the global order in their image.

743
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:56,180
他们为国外的腐败政权提供物质援助
They've provided material aid to corrupt regimes abroad.

744
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,180
他们犯下了 并教唆别人犯下了大屠杀
They committed and abetted mass murder

745
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,430
他们在地球的每个角落
and they've waged their crony capitalist war

746
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,480
发动了裙带资本主义战争
in every corner of the planet.

They have told the rest of us

Play ball. Sit up straight do as we tell you, and pay the toll.

749
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:13,240
是时候喊停了
It's time to say enough.

750
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:17,660
我们不会再参与他们的残暴行径
We will no longer be a party to their legacy of brutality.

751
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:22,080
我们不会再为他们的贪婪受罪
We will no longer suffer for their greed.

752
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:28,920
是时候向美国和全世界 展示我们的价值了
