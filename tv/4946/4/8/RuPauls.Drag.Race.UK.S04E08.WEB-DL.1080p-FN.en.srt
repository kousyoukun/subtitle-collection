00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,800
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi!

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,480
RUPAUL: Previously on
"RuPaul's Drag Race UK."

3
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,400
For this week's Maxi Challenge,

4
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,480
you'll be giving the Queen Team
a head-to-toe drag makeover.

5
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,080
- Bit worried you might be liking this

6
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,840
a little bit too much, Gemma.
- [laughs]

7
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,040
- A shift silhouette, as we've seen it
miss, and we've seen it hit.

8
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,680
- Right. This time, it's gonna hit.

9
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,520
- We're playing on
a sort of fairy pixie theme.

10
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,240
- There's camp, love,
and there's gay vomit.

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,400
- Pixie Polite.

12
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,040
I think the makeup, you did your sister
just a little dirty there.

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,360
Dakota Schiffer.

14
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,720
Every time, it's the same silhouette.

15
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,600
I just want more. Could you blame me?

16
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,200
Cheddar Gorgeous.
- It was just fabulous.

17
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,400
- Condragulations, you are the winner
of this week's challenge.

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,080
Pixie Polite,
shantay, you stay.

19
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,040
Dakota Schiffer, sashay away.

20
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,280
- The doll has to leave the valley.

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,360
[suspenseful music]

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,080
[Danny sighing]

23
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,320
JONBERS: Jesus. I'm all tangled.

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,280
We're back in the workroom
after elimination and everyone is sad

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,760
because Dakota has been
our little sister here.

26
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,680
She's such a sweet sweetheart.

27
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,120
- Oh, God.
[sighs]

28
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,040
[sniffling]

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,080
"The doll may have left this valley,
but she certainly left her mark.

30
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,480
Trans rights."

31
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,280
- Yes, trans rights.
- Trans rights!

32
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,360
- Oh.

33
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,160
- I don't know about you girls,
but I think this has been the hardest one.

34
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,160
To see her go.

35
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,280
- She's made herstory.
And she did so well.

36
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,320
- Oh, my God. Incredible.

37
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,680
CHEDDAR:
Her journey's only just beginning,

38
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,200
so I'm really excited for Dakota.

39
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,320
I'm just sad for me 'cause I don't get to
have her around me anymore.

40
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,960
- It's really coming down to the wire.
- Yeah.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
- Like, it's five of us now.

42
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,640
- Like, today, it literally
could have been any of us.

43
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,240
- It was so close.

44
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,840
- Well done, babe.
- Well done.

45
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,880
- Well done, Pixie.

46
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,040
- I didn't want to see
either of you go home,

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,240
and I'm so proud that you're here still.

48
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,720
Even if you did wear that.

49
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,600
[laughter]

50
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,200
- How rude.
- Oh, my God.

51
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,400
- Nobody ever wants to lip sync,
but I'm glad I did this week.

52
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,120
I think I've been coasting a little bit.

53
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,720
And I smashed that lip sync,

54
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,680
so these girls better stop
underestimating me.

55
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,960
- We love you so much, girl.
- We love you so much, Dakota.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,520
- But someone had to go home,
so bye.

57
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,600
- I think that Pixie's gained
a huge boost of confidence

58
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,880
from this lip sync experience.

59
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,480
- Right.
Come on, girls.

60
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,360
Top five.
Let's go and take a seat.

61
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,240
- Let's see if it verges on the cocky.
[sinister stinger]

62
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,600
- Danny, babe, how you feeling?

63
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,760
- [sighs]
CHEDDAR: Ah, love.

64
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,280
- I'll be honest.
Every person that's gone, up to now,

65
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,600
it kind of just felt like it's their time.

66
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,160
Don't want to make anyone else feel shit,

67
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,520
but I just don't think
she was the worst tonight.

68
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,600
I'm proud that you're here still as well.

69
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,440
You're me sister and I didn't want
to see you go.

70
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,920
And as soon as it was you
that was in the bottom,

71
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,600
me heart just broke.
[sniffling]

72
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,040
- I don't--I'm not--

73
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,560
I don't want to fish, but like,
do you think it was me?

74
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,480
Is it me that you think
that should have went?

75
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,640
[dramatic music]

76
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,520
- I don't think anyone should have gone.
- Yeah.

77
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,640
- I did think you were gonna be
in the bottom.

78
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,800
- I love Dakota so much,

79
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,240
but I do think my look was more
put together and refined.

80
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,160
I'm obviously sad to see Dakota gone too,

81
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,360
but I'm not the one that sent her home.
The judges did.

82
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,800
I still have so much more to show
and give, and I'm fighting for that spot.

83
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,680
And I'm the one that has to work
the hardest because I don't have a badge.

84
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,920
I deserve a badge too.

85
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,120
I mean, look, I've done mediocre
in this competition,

86
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,600
but some of them have done
really mediocre.

87
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,320
So some of those badges
I don't think should be there.

88
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,640
- You know what?

89
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,760
Emotions aside, we have--
we've done it, girls.

90
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,360
We're gonna smash the back doors
out of it, girls.

91
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,720
JONBERS: Smash them open!
PIXIE: Yes!

92
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,200
We are the top five of season four!
- Top five!

93
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,800
- Yes!

94
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,520
- Somebody smash my back doors in.
[laughter]

95
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,960
- Don't wish that too soon, bitch.

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,480
- Come on, let's get out of drag.

97
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,880
- From 12 noisy, annoying girls...

98
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,280
[both cheering, laughing]

99
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,080
- To five still annoying girls.

100
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,360
I'm connected to you.

101
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,040
- Ah! It's--it's eating me!
[laughter]

[mock choking]

103
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,840
- It just takes a little topping over
for someone to kick you out

104
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,160
and you sashay away.

105
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,800
JONBERS: I loved your Turkey Twizzle.

106
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,400
- I was inspired by your neck.

107
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,960
[laughter]

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,920
- Oh! [imitating air horn]
- Gobble, gobble!

109
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,440
- This is not even a race.

110
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
- Give it a bit of this.

111

BLACK PEPPA:
This is a sprint.

112
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,160
I am going to be Usain Bolt
behind these bitches

113
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,800
because I will catch up to them.

[suspenseful music]

115
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,360
- It's a Cheddar Gorgeous classic.

116
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,280
It'll go really well with
your Danny Beard face.

It's a brand-new day in the workroom,
and I am so excited to be here!

I really want to just have a lot of fun,
prove myself,

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,280
and just be camp as hell.

Another week.
How we feeling?

- It's very real, actually.

- Did anyone not expect
to get this far?

- Yeah.
- I don't know, actually.

- Really?
- Totally.

No, it's not like, a lack of self-belief.

I really--I really believe in myself.

142
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,800
I just didn't know whether I'd be able
to showcase who I am.

143

I'm in top five, and
I have three badges.

Do you know what?

145
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,400
I might actually have
to start accepting

that I could be quite good
at this drag malarkey.

No tea, no shade.

I did expect to be.
- Confidence.

151
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,280
- Yeah, it's not just confidence.
I'm not delusional.

152
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,160
But like, I did expect to
definitely be in a top spot.

00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,640
Is there anyone who isn't here

that we expected to be in top five?

155

- Dakota.
- I thought Dakota would be here.

that I necessarily believe

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,200
she should have been
in the bottom last week.

158
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,640
- You think it should have been me?

159
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,960
I don't think so at all.

160
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,600
- I'm not coming for you, though.
I'm just saying that's what I think.

161
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,200
- That is what you think.

162
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,440
[suspenseful stinger]

163
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,880
Pixie, why are you bringing this up again?

164
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,600
Aren't we meant to be like, sisters here?

165
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,360
But this is--
this is the one thing actually

166
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,520
that did come up in Untucked,
is that people said to me,

167
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,880
what's your USP?

168
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,480
Well, what's your USP?

169
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,760
[suspenseful stinger]

170
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,400
Do you wear pixie wings
every week to your gig?

171
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,280
- Well, no, but it's a branding thing.

172
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,160
I know it wasn't fashionable,
but that's not what I do.

173
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,720
- Fashion is what I do,
and fashion's what I got given the runway.

174
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,200
And that's what they did my critique on,

175
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,360
and it was the strongest fashion look
on the runway.

176
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,160
- OK, well, I'm not trying to do
fashion, though, Jonbers, am I?

177
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,320
- No, I know, but I am.

178
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,080
- She is 100% pure-pressed.

179
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,760
She is not from concentrate today.
She is not having it.

180
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,040
No one's at each other's throat here.

181
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,200
- I know this is the thing as well.

182
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,640
Like, I don't mean it personally.

183
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,800
- It felt a very pointed comment.

184
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,680
I'm just defending myself.
I've had to defend myself all my life.

185
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,000
Everyone telling me
whether my looks are good enough.

186
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,640
- You are the most
fashionable person here.

187
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,640
What I sometimes struggle with is

188
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,560
what is the story the fashion is telling?

189
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,760
I want to get to know you more.

190
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,480
- I think it's like, you know,
you get a split second on that runway,

191
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,240
and if it comes across that
you can't understand the story,

192
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:09,040
then I'm just like, well, everyone else
needs to catch up with me.

193
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,240
They're debating whether
my drag is valid here.

194
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,840
That's not up for debate by you.

195
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,040
They're all a bunch of snakes.

196
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
Is this week my week to get a badge?

197
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,400
- No!
- We're fancy!

198
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,840
[siren blaring]

199
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,800
- Oh!

200
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,560
[screaming, laughing]

201
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,240
Be nice to us.

202
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,120
RUPAUL (slurring):
Her Majesty did already done had herses.

203
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,200
Hey, racers.
all: Hey!

204
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,040
RUPAUL (ON TV):
There can be 100 people in the room,

205
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,080
and 99 don't believe in you.

206
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,680
But you're here,

207
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,240
and those losers
are just staring at their phones.

208
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,920
So just do whatever you want.
[chuckles]

209
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,200
[engine roaring]

210
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,280
- But what?

211
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,880
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi!

212
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,240
[chuckling]

213
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,640
- She's back.

214
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,240
- Hello, ladykins.

215
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,640
- Hi!
- Hey, Ru!

216
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,080
- Quick question.

217
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,600
Are there any thespians in the house?

218
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,880
- The Queen Team
are mostly thespians, I think.

219
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,040
[laughter]

220
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,720
- Because for this week's
Maxi Challenge,

221
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,240
you'll be acting in a murder mystery
with a modern twist.

222
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,360
- Yeah!
- Yay!

223
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,240
- It's called "The Squirrel Games."

224
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,240
[laughter]

225
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,120
- Not "Murder on the Whorient Express"?
- [laughs]

226
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,320
- Now, each of you will play
a fictional reality star

227
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,640
who checks into the Big Mutha house.

228
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,080
- [screeches]
- Amazing.

229
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,240
- That is camp.

230
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,040
- Only to discover that your fate

231
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,440
is being controlled by
a sassy and sadistic squirrel.

232
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,280
[all gasping]

233
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,920
#DragRaceUK.

234
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,120
Now, Cheddar Gorgeous,

235
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,880
as the winner
of last week's Maxi Challenge,

236
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,400
you get to assign the roles.

237
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,720
- [hoarsely] The power!

238
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,480
[sinister stinger]

239
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:07,160
And later today, you'll work with
my favorite director, Michelle Visage.

240
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,400
all: Yay!

241
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,080
- I am a fan of British reality shows,

242
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,880
I'm a fan of "Squid Games,"

243
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,400
I'm a fan of me.

244
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,520
This is a great mix.

245
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,880
- Racers, start your engines,

246
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,160
and may the best drag queen win.

247
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,880
[all screaming]

248
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,160
- Go, go, go!

249
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,960
- Ooh, I got highlighter pens.

250
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,440
PIXIE: The plot thickens.

251
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,440
JONBERS: I've had a few acting
experiences in my life.

252
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,240
I've played the fool in panto before,

253
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,520
I've played--imagine this,
I've played a drunk. [laughing]

254
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,280
- Get ready for "Big Mutha,"

255
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,640
the second most chaotic drag reality show
on the BBC

256
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,440
that sees five iconic reality stars,

257
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,480
each famous in their own field,

258
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,040
living together in the Big Mutha house.

259
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:58,080
I have to confess,
I am not a huge fan of reality TV at all,

260
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,680
which is ironic
given my current situation.

261
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,040
[dramatic stinger]

262
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,520
All right, guys. This season features
the sickest and most evil twist yet,

263
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,040
"The Squirrel Games."

264
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,600
No longer are these mothers
competing to boost their careers.

265
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,520
They'll also be fighting
to save their lives

266
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,960
in TV's most brutal Maxi Challenge ever.

267
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,440
- God, this feels too real.

268
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,560
- Queen number one, winner of Lust Isle,

269
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,560
Minxie is a model, business mogul, and
influencer with over 20 million followers.

270
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,200
Queen number two,
Kimmy Boobburn.

271
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,960
[laughter]

272
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,920
Reality show veteran Kimmy
is here to clean up the competition,

273
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,840
and she'd happily wipe the floor

274
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,360
with any of these horrible, horrible,
rude little ratbags.

275
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,840
[laughter]
- Amazing.

276
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
- I wonder who that's based on.
- Iconic.

277
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,360
- Queen three, Bev Growls.

278
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,240
Bev Growls is the ultimate TV survivalist,

279
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,240
and the definition of a fighting machine.

280
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,520
Queen four: Sassy and Fugly the Dog.

281
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,360
When they first appeared on
"Britain's Got Niche Skills,"

282
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,040
this dynamic duo were quite literally
the underdogs of the competition.

283
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,440
Queen five, Divine-ah Dickall.

284
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,640
The ultimate reality TV presenter

285
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,160
and a celebrity in her own right.

286
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,440
She's glamorous, gossipy,
and gooped by all the shenanigans

287
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,600
happening in the house.

288
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,160
all: Ooh.

289
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,600
- These are all really good characters.

290
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,800
- Do you want another one?
- Do you want another one?

291
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,040
- There we go. One for you.
- Thank you very much.

292
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,560
- One for you.
- Thank you.

293
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,440
- Shall we read it through?
- Yeah.

294
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,400
- I'm excited to read this script.

295
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,520
I think with any reality TV show,
you've got the hero,

296
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,000
and then you've got your supporting cast.

297
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,600
I'd like to be the hero,

298
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,840
and everyone else can be
the supporting cast this week.

299
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,600
That'd be lovely. I'd love a badge.
Thank you very much.

300
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,240
[laughing]

301
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,400
- You OK over there, little poppet?

302
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,360
- They've got a "Big Brother India"
reference, and I'm living for it.

303
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,800
- No one wants to make that mistake where
they skim through and like,

304
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,720
"Yeah, I'm OK with that character."

305
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,920
Any little wrong decision can mess you up
at this point,

306
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,880
so you want to make sure that
you have the right role.

307
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,760
- [laughs] A king at lance,
if you don't mind.

308
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,400
- Has everyone had
a chance to read?

309
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,400
How about you, Jonbers?
Who you feeling?

310
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,080
- When the roles were being read,
I really was drawn to Sassy.

311
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,480
People are going to think
I'm absolutely mental if I tell them why.

312
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,520
I literally had a dream that
I was going to play a dog.

313
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,320
- And you get a puppet.

314
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,160
- Although it is another animal.
[chuckles]

315
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,800
Yeah, that's another animal.

316
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,200
In my dream, it was like,
me going, "aroo?"

317
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,760
That's the universe telling me
that I have to play a dog.

[laughing]

319
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,640
- Right. I'm happy for you
to have that character.

320
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,960
So Jonbers is going to be
Sassy and Fugly the Dog.

321
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,280
- I like Bev Growls.

322
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,400
Stands out to me.
- OK. Yeah.

323
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,800
So you're up for Bev Growls?
- Yeah.

324
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,400

- Who would really love Minxie?

327
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,560
- I'm feeling Minxie.

328
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,720
Or maybe Divine-ah Dickall as well.
- OK.

329
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,680
- What about you, Cheds?
Which ones do you like?

330
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,640
- Um, I--
see, I feel like Divine-ah Dickall,

331
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,360
I feel like I've done
that character before.

332
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,680
I think--
well, Minxie I haven't really done.

333
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,040
OK.

334
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,320
So I could do Minxie.

335
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,960
A fun, self-absorbed, daft person.

336
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,640
I mean, it won't be a challenge
for me at all.

It's basically my life.

doing Divine-ah?

- Yeah.
- Sure?

- Yeah.

- And you're a Divine-ah.

00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,200
- Is everyone happy
with their roles?

346
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
- Sure.
- Yeah.

347
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,560
- Shall we highlight?
- I think so.

348
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,080
- Yes, let's highlight.
- Let's do it.

349
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,360
- I really wanted to play
the Lust Island knob,

350
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,240
but Cheddar's going to have it,
and that's fine.

I'm playing Sassy and Fugly the Dog.

355
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,200
Not only have I got to think about
what my lines are,

356
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,080
I've got to think about this dog.
Woof, woof.

yeah, I think we can do enough
to make it good.

361
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,480
I'm just worried that not everyone
in the room is an actor.

362
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,960

from Macbeth over there, plotting.

able to push it big enough.

- I am happy with my character.

368
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,680
I feel like there's a lot of things
I can play off of

369
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,640
that's different from
any of the challenges I've done.

370
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,000
And now I feel like this could--

371
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,360
I can take this character
to a whole 'nother, you know, dimension.

372
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,240
I'm always used to looking
prim and proper and pretty,

373
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,120
and it's time to get dirty and crazy.

And I feel like this is a real good way
to show the judges something new.

don't you read Reddit?

this cast for weeks.

to be on a national tour.

of Brummie comes through.

Is it Fugly? Pugsley?

I mean, I'm a dog. It's a dog.
We're all dogs.

00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,000
- And action.

470
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,840
- My Pugly's been through
enough today.

471
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,760
[sobbing]

472
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,440
- Pugsy, Fugsley, Mugsley.
[mumbling]

473
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,560
- Pugly's seen it all.

474
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,880
- It's your dog.
What's it called?

475
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,760
- Do you think my poor Pugly's
been through enough today?

476
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
- And cut. I keep hearing "Pugly."

477
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,880
- Am I doing it with "my poor"?

478
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,600
Am I saying "Pugly" there?
- Yes. "Poor Pugly."

479
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,160
- Because it's a P-P? OK.
- Yeah.

480
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,880
- [clears throat]

481
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,800
Don't put a P in front of Pugly.

482
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,200
No, Fugly!
Oh, fuck's sake.

483
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,920
- We can carry on.
We'll go to scene three.

484
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,320
Here we go, kids.

485
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,960
And action.

486
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,600
- Oh, there's going to be hell to pay
when I find those--

487
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,880
sorry, line?

488
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,840
- "Who's had their mucky paws
on my bloomers?"

489
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,600
Let's try it again.

490
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,680
- There'll be hell to pay
when I find you out--

491
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,960
There'll be hell to pay when I find out
whoever's stolen my knickers.

492
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,480
- And cut.
- OK.

493
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,160
- The impersonation of a certain someone
is fantastic,

494
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,240
but you need to have levels.

495
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,600
Play with it.
- I couldn't agree more, Michelle.

496
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,720
I was worried I wouldn't go big enough
for the character, so let's go big.

497
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,240
Oh, there's going to be hell to pay
when I find that filthy, filthy person

498
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:44,120
who's had their mucky paws
all over my bloomers.

499
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,400
- OK. Cut, cut, cut, cut.

500
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,720
Let's do the--
do you know what the line is?

501
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,600
- Whoever's stolen my bloomers.

502
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,560
There's--
oh, sorry.

503
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,680
Don't you start with me, lovey.

504
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,120
Line? Sorry.

505
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,240
Oh, I'm going to--
sorry, I'll try that again.

506
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,960
- "How about I clean that
grubby little mouth out?"

507
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,120
- Yes, that's the one.

508
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,480
- How many takes is this line?

509
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,520
- Sorry, line?

510
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,680
- Cut.

511
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,280
It's, "do you want it?"

512
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,800
- That's the one. Sorry.
- I do.

513
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,280
One of the advantages
of having to wait around

514
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,160
for other people to remember their lines,

515
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,400
I was just trying to fixate on having fun.

516
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,120
- OK, we can just do one more take.

517
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,400
Get it right.

518
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,280
- Oh, I'm going to shove this
where the sun don't shine, my dear.

519
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,520
- [exclaims]

520
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,160
[dramatic stinger]

521
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,560
- It all just feels
a little bit of a mess.

522
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,080
- [whispers] Hit me.
- Oh, sorry.

523
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,720
- Oh!

524
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,160
- And cut.

525
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,880
[dramatic stinger]

526
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,200
CHEDDAR: For top five,

527
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,920
I feel like we should have been
waltzing into this challenge

528
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,120
far more prepared.

529
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,520
- OK, Big Muthas. That's a wrap.

530
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,000
See you on the runway.

531
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,600
- Let's hope we actually
all make it out alive.

532
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,840
[electronic music]

533
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,880
- Woo!

534
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,560
- Top five!
- Top five!

535
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,880
- I've got my dog.
- [barking]

536
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,120
[laughter, yelling]

537
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,680
- Jumpy little rodent!

538
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,520
So it's elimination day,
and one of these rodents are going home.

539
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,080
- I am sick of being spotty.

540
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,440
I can't wait to--
- Oh, my God.

541
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,400
I have never been this
so spotty in my life.

542
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,800
- It's been a long journey,
hasn't it, girls?

543
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,120
Is anyone missing home?

544
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
- So much.
- Yeah, I am.

545
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,840
I'm really missing speaking to my parents.

546
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,120
Because it's been such
a transition from like,

547
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,760
how it was whenever
I first came out as gay

548
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,440
to like, in the past like, six years,

549
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,120
they've just really supported me.

550
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,120
Being in this competition is
actually really hard because

551
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,560
we're away from our families.

552
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,200
And I normally speak to my parents
three, four times a week.

553
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,720
I really miss them so much.

554
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,880
And they come to all my shows.

555
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,040
Like, my dad was the one that told me.

556
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,520
He was like, "Have you ever heard of
this 'RuPaul's Drag Race'?"

557
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,080
- Aww!
- And I was like, "Yes, Dad." [laughing]

558
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,840
"I've auditioned every year."

559
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,920
And he was like,
"You should definitely be on that."

560
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,040
And I was like, it's so wild for my dad
to say something like that.

561
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,160
- How are you with your parents?

562
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,760
- My parents are great.
They're incredibly supportive.

563
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,360
I think like everyone, my dad--

564
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,280
I think my dad struggled with
me coming out first.

565
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,920
But you know, my dad was
a massive Erasure fan.

566
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,160
He's a massive David Bowie fan.
- Oh, wow.

567
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,360
- I joked with him recently.

568
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,840
I was like, "Dad, you do realize
this is all your fault, don't you?"

569
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,360
[laughter]

570
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,960
My dad, he's told me how
he's challenged people at work

571
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,320
who've been homophobic.

572
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,760
And I'm so proud of him for that.

573
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,440
To be where he's from and to make that
progression in his own thinking,

574
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,280
he's really amazing.
Really, really amazing.

575
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,440
- Do you know what? I have a really,
really good relationship with my dad.

576
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,880
He was a fireman.

577
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,480
I remember when I first came out,
I told my mom first.

578
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,520
And I was like, "Don't tell Dad."
And I was scared.

579
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,640
And like, me dad came into me room

580
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,000
and he was like, "Your mum told me."

581
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,520
And I was like, "Told you what?"

582
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,680
[laughter]

583
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,800
But he was like, "Dan, we've always known,
and we love you no matter what."

584
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,720
He's like a big softie
in a big, mean frame.

585
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,600
And he was always fine with me being gay.

586
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,080
Just really supportive.

587
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,880
When I did Liverpool Pride one year,

588
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,480
he really pushed to borrow a fire engine
from another station

589
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,800
because it had been decorated pink
for breast cancer,

590
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,920
but he wanted to drive
the pink fire engine at Liverpool Pride.

591
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,440
Like, for me,
but obviously not for me, but...

592
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,120
- But for you.
- Yeah. You know?

593
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,320
- That's really special.

594
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,000
- A lot of my sense of humor comes,
I think, from my dad.

595
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,520
I'm turning into my dad
as I'm getting older

596
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,280
but just in a dress,
which is even funnier.

597
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,280
- Pixie, angel,
what about your dad?

598
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,440
- My dad was in
the emergency services like Danny.

599
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,120
My dad was a traffic policeman for years,

600
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,680
so we never really used to see him.

601
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,880
When I was a teenager
and you're discovering

602
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,240
who you are and all that stuff,

603
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,840
it was really intimidating
because, you know,

604
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,880
I didn't feel like
I really knew him that well.

605
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,640
It wasn't until he was retired
and I was a bit more grown up

606
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,640
that we really started to
have a proper relationship

607
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,920
because there was time.

608
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,840
And looking back,

609
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:25,120
I think I must have always known
how much of a gentle soul my dad is.

610
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,160
We're so close now.

611
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,920
I've never seen my dad get
particularly emotional,

612
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,640
but when I told him that
I got on this show, he...

613
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,880
he basically was screaming
like a little girl,

614
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,160
running around the room, like--

615
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,160
and I just didn't really expect it.

616
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,240
- That's amazing.

617
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,040
- And I know how proud he is of me.

618
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,080
He's always said that one day,
when I'm famous and rich,

619
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,360
he would like me to buy him a Ferrari.

620
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,080
And it was always a little joke we had,

621
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,040
but now maybe I will.
Don't know. [chuckles]

622
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,080
- How about you, Peppa?

623
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,520
I know you're not particularly close
with your born family.

624
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,960
- In Birmingham, the queer family
that I have made there,

625
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,440
they have brought out who Black Peppa is.
I didn't know who I was.

626
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,480
At home in Birmingham,
I do have a loving family.

627
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,680
I always say that family
doesn't have to be blood.

628
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,280
Family to me is the family that you make.

629
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,280
Birmingham family, they help me to accept
things about myself

630
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,800
that I didn't necessarily like.

631
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,000
For example, being quiet and shy.

632
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,400
But they saw that, and they were like,

633
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,960
there's someone behind all of that.
- Yeah.

634
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,960
- And I'm like, no one has ever
kind of spoken to me like that,

635
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,360
not even my parents.

636
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,360
My queer family has been there
for me through and through,

637
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,000
and I don't take that lightly.

638
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,800
I am so thankful to have them in my life.

639
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,120
And for them seeing the potential
that I've always had

640
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,960
that I probably necessarily never seen.

641
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,160
- And you got your Birmingham family,

642
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,720
but now you've got
your "Drag Race" family too.

643
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,560
- Now I have all you crusty bitches
to deal with.

644
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,760
- Wow.
- Ha-ha! Excuse me!

645
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,640
I was going to say "let's have a hug,"

646
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,200
but now I am like, now do you want to get
a hug from Crustina Decline?

647
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,800
- All of a sudden,
we're back in the competition, everybody.

648
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,800
Let's do our makeup, shall we?

649
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,240
- Today, it is the premiere
of "The Squirrel Games,"

650
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,200
the feel-good death movie of the year.

651
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,280
- So sad someone has to go today.

652
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,080
- Right?
- Oh, no. Have fun.

653
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,320
- Yeah, bye-bye.
- [laughs]

654
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,160
- Every week,
the pressure gets even more.

655
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,640
And I think this week would be
the hardest to go home

656
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,160
just before the top four.

657
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,880
But one thing's for sure,
there's an eviction on the cards.

658

Cover girl, put the bass in your walk.

Head to toe, let your whole body talk.

[voiceover] And what?

664
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,400
Welcome to the main stage
of "RuPaul's Drag Race UK."

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,280
Michelle Visage.

666
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,560
- Ru, I'm your "Celebrity Big Brother"
from another mother.

667
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,720
- Uh, that makes no sense.

668
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,360
- Well, if you think
that makes no sense,

669
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,040
wait till you see the movie.
- Oh!

670
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,880
- The super specksy Alan Carr.

671
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,960
Now, Alan, I hear you make
a cameo appearance

672
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,520
in tonight's acting challenge.

673
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,080
- Look, I was young,
and I needed the money, all right?

674
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,360
[laughter]

675
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,960
- Didn't we all?

676
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,680
And my pal,
the delicious Lorraine Pascale.

677
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,760
Welcome, Lorraine.

678
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,520
- Oh, Ru, thank you so much

679
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,840
for giving me a front row seat
to the best show on Earth.

680
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
- Aww.

681
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,880
Lorraine, you ain't seen nothing yet.

682
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,080
[laughter]

683
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,960
This week, we challenged our queens

684
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,520
to act the Big Mutha house down.

685
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,120
And tonight on the runway,

686
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:02,680
category is "Ruff and Ready,"
a celebration of ruffles.

687
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,000
Racers, start your engines,

688
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,080
and may the best drag queen win.

689
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,520
- [singing] Can you feel the love?

690
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,240
Category is "Ruff and Ready."
- Ooh.

691
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,920
- Up first, Danny Beard.
Oh, Danny Beard.

692
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,880
DANNY: My inspiration really is just
Scouse girls going to the race,

693
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,120
and the fellas probably breed dogs,
or you know, other "business."

694
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:34,720
- Sometimes we like to do things
nice and ruffled.

695
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,680
DANNY: I wanted to be sexy.
I'm in I think it's silk.

696
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,800
Fuck knows.
I don't work in a fabric shop.

697
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,720
- Ooh, the frill of it all.

698
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,400
DANNY:
I wanted to show the judges versatility.

699
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,920
I didn't want to keep serving them
the same old boiled up shite.

700
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,120
- "E-ruff" is "e-ruff." No more queers.

701
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,640
- [laughing]

RUPAUL: Up next, Jonbers Blonde.

704
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,000
- Jonbers, I told you to stop
"tulle-ing" around already.

705
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,400
JONBERS:
I'm very excited by the ruffle theme.

706
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,320
This look is my fashion look.
This is my moment.

707
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,400
Ah! I can't sing it
'cause of the copyright,

708
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,600
but I want to sing it!
And you know what I mean.

CHEDDAR: I am serving beautiful yellow
and black pansy realness.

721
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,000
But it does have
a serious message as well.

722
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,400
- Thank you, 'pecial.

723
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,360
CHEDDAR: The Pansy Project
is an amazing art project

724
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,400
that plants pansies in
places of homophobic violence.

725
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,240
And I've actually got two pansies
that have been planted

726
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,400
in honor of incidents in my own life.

BLACK PEPPA: Now, I knew for a fact
that none of these girls

739
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,720
are going to come up with
a denim idea for ruffles.

740
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,920
And I wanted to be different.

741
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,920
- I've never seen denim
bingo wings before.

742

BLACK PEPPA: I can see the judges very
clearly under this facekini,

743

PIXIE: My look is inspired by
my love of history.

751
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:19,840
I've loved the majesty of kings and queens
and scandals and all that shit.

it's Elizabethan Hurley.

- It's Shakespeare's sister.

755
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,680
PIXIE: It's a bit of a shame that we had
an Elizabeth I look

756
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,120
during the Snatch Game,
but I feel pretty gorgeous anyway.

[laughter]

761
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,440
PIXIE: I know it's not a very accurate
historical take, but I've made it me.

762
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,960
- Oh, look, it's Victorian Beckham.

763
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,400
- More like
Mary, Queen of Scats.

941
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,080
[splattering]
[judges laughing]

942
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,360
- Life's a bitch,
and then you get killed by one.

943
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:24,680
[barking laughter]

944
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,880
[judges laughing]

945
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,600
- Brava, brava, brava.

946
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,160
And you are watching the BBC.

947
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,800
[laughter]

948
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,320
Now it's time for the judges critiques.

949
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,040
First up, Danny Beard.

950
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,320
- Divine-ah Dickall.

951
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,120
Your role was an interesting one because

952
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,600
you were parodying somebody
that is so kind of pure.

953
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,760
But when you started
really taking the mick

954
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,240
and having fun, she came to life.

955
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,320
- Do you fancy another one?

956
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,040
- The mannerisms,
that gurning, and the rhythm.

957
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,840
I thought she was in the room.

958
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,640
- Kind of got a bit of [indistinct],

959
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,640
but I love the--
[laughing]

960
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,200
I love the character.

961
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,120
- I think this is really beautiful,
what you're doing tonight.

962
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,360
This is something that
we don't get to see you in often.

963
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,360
I don't know if you do it very often.

964
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,560
But yet you still keep
Danny Beard in there.

965
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,120
- You could be going to
Ladies' Day at Aintree,

966
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,600
having a glass of Lambrini and a Ciapusci.

967
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,360
- Just that shape.

968
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,160
Oh, it's adorable. You look gorgeous.

969
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,240
- You set the tone for the whole piece.
You were energetic.

970
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,800
Did your character have an objective?

971
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,320
- Yeah, so you're RuPaul.
You host the show.

972
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,360
You're the captain of the ship.

973
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,680
I was channeling that,
and then when she gets thrown in,

974
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,000
she's like, why am I here?

975
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,720
That would be like
you getting thrown in with us.

976
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,560
You'd be like, "Piss off.

977
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,120
I'm not competing with
these ugly bitches."

978
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,680
You know? That's what I was channeling.

979
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,520
- You were ridiculous and very funny.

980
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,720
Thank you very much, Danny.

981
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,280
- Thank you, guys.

982
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,120
- Up next, Jonbers Blonde.

983
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,360
- Jonbers, you were
Sassy and Fugly the Dog.

984
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,680
It's not easy having to remember you

985
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,160
and then having to remember the dog.

986
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,520
So sometimes we get stuck
in kind of one level.

987
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,400
- Divine-ah's dead!

988
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,600
[sobbing]

989
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,360
- There could have been like, other notes,

990
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,640
like the gray and the black and the white.

991
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,400
Make it more of a dance.

992
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,720
- Sassy and Fugly and obviously,
Ashleigh and Pudsey,

993
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,440
they're not known for
their massive personalities.

994
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,200
You thought, right, I'm going to
make this dog as mad as possible.

995
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,080
It was like watching a double act
even though one of them was stuffed.

996
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,320
- And this tonight, Jonbers,
this outfit is spectacular.

997
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,800
The hat is perfectly worn.

998
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,680
The makeup is glorious.

999
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,200
Who is she?

1000
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,040
- You look absolutely gorgeous.

1001
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,080
Very sexy.

1002
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,800
Just beautiful.

1003
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,480
- Everything about this outfit,
it's perfection.

1004
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,560
So gorgeous.

1005
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,480
One of the most beautiful outfits
to ever grace this runway.

1006
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,200
- Oh, wow.

1007
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,080
- Now your performance,
it was all pedal to the metal.

1008
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,280
- Looking back and watching it,
I totally see where you're coming from,

1009
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,040
where it was quite shouty.

1010
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,320
There was a little bit maybe of me in it,

1011
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,440
where it should have been
more of a character.

1012
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,040
- But you look gorgeous tonight.

1013
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,320
- And looking gorgeous means everything.
- Doesn't it? I mean, come on.

1014
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,080
[laughter]

1015
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,120
Thank you, Jonbers.

1016
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,720
- Thank you so much, everyone.

1017
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,440
- Up next, Cheddar Gorgeous.

1018
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,200
- I thought you nailed it as Minxie.

1019
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,040
- #stillnotdead.

1020
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,040
- You had peaks and valleys and colors,

1021
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,440
so I had a really good time watching you.

1022
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,080
- Cheddar.

1023
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:47,040
This outfit reminds me of when
I used to model way back then.

1024
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:51,680
And you know, on the runway
I'd wear this kind of silhouette.

1025
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,760
It's stunning. You look ethereal.

1026
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,080
- What the hell are you?

1027
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,120
Are you a high-vis amoeba?

1028
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,720
Are you a neon scourer? I don't know.

1029
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,640
But then I think
that's part of the mystery of you.

1030
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,520
- This outfit is ridiculous.

1031
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,480
It is so gorgeous.

1032
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,880
I love it.

1033
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,600
And you were so funny in this thing.

1034
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,440
You've got it all.

1035
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,520
- Thank you so much.

1036
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,040
I mean, I loved doing the challenge.

1037
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,560
And it was--

1038
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,640
because I didn't feel a lot of feedback
from you Michelle--

1039
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,000
- Didn't need it.
- And it was fine,

1040
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,640
but I always go into that place
where I'm like,

1041
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,200
"Oh, well, God, I must be terrible then."
- Yeah. Right.

1042
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,320
- I always think of critique as a gift,

1043
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,080
and so I'm often looking
for that negative feedback.

1044
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,520
But I'm just--yeah. Thank you so much.

1045
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,640
- Well, thank you, Cheddar.
- Thank you.

1046
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,920
- Up next, it is Black Peppa.
- Hey.

1047
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,080
- I liked where you were going
with Bev Growls,

1048
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,560
but I was trying to help you
not scream so much.

1049
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,040
- What I would have loved to see,
more of a change though

1050
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,480
'cause it was like shout, shout, shout.

1051
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,880
- Let "The Squirrel Games" begin!

1052
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,600
- But I think it's always good to be told

1053
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,360
that you have to take
your foot off the gas a bit

1054
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,360
than you needed to give it more.

1055
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,560
- I'm having flashbacks
to like, Snatch Game.

1056
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,600
As Lil Nas, you were like,
"Oh, yeah, I sort of get it."

1057
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,120
And then when you come out
on the runway, all is forgiven.

1058
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,600
It's just so clever
and I love the shape of it. It's genius.

1059
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,520
- This denim fantasy, it's a moment,

1060
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,600
and I'm here for every single bit of it.

1061
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,800
- This is another outfit that will
go down in "Drag Race" history.

1062
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,040
It's so extraordinary.

1063
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,560
It's Moschino meets Gaultier.

1064
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,840
It's fabulous.

1065
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,040
My eyes don't know where to rest.

1066
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,720
Unfortunately,
that wasn't in your character.

1067
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,360
You didn't have the peaks and valleys,

1068
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,440
but it's all present
in that outfit you're wearing.

1069
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,320
- I definitely need to
believe in myself more

1070
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,480
when it comes to these challenges.

1071
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,640
I'm not a comedian, but I need to
get that crap out of my head

1072
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,960
because I can be funny.

1073
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,320
And the thing is, I am funny
when I don't even try to be funny.

1074
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,640
Just believe in myself a lot more.

1075
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,720
- All right.
Thank you, Black Peppa.

1076
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,000
- Thank you.

1077
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,160
- Up next, Pixie Polite.

1078
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,840
- You did a fantastic Kim Woodburn
impersonation.

1079
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,040
- You horrible, horrible little girl!

1080
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,000
- But I wanted you to
put more of you in there.

1081
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,520
And I felt like you were so concerned with
the impersonation...

1082
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,440
- Yeah.
- That we didn't get you injected into it.

1083
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,000
- I know what Michelle is saying,

1084
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,400
but Kim Woodburn is so out there

1085
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,000
that it's hard to put yourself in there.

1086
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,240
You know, you got her breathy delivery.

1087
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,640
You know, we've all done it.

1088
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,600
(IMITATING WOODBURN)
I get on with everyone, lovey,

1089
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,120
but you're nothing but a little bitch.

1090
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,560
[laughter]

1091
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,080
- Tonight on the runway,
we've seen this look so many times,

1092
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:41,640
so you've got to really go overboard
and do obnoxious ruffles

1093
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,480
on a ruffles runway.
- Yeah.

1094
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,400
- I actually love the delicate ruffles,

1095
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,720
and the hair is everything.

1096
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,080
- It's very cute.

1097
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,080
I know that throughout this competition

1098
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,640
you've really been pushing yourself
with the looks.

1099
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,080
I know the kind of queen you are.
I've followed you over the years.

1100
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,400
You've really evolved in
the course of this competition,

1101
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,840
and I'm very proud of you for doing that.

1102
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,760
In the sketch, you were very funny.

1103
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,560
- I thought I did OK,
but I was a bit disappointed in myself.

1104
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,240
And I think I'm letting the pressures
of this competition really get to me.

1105
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,440
- Yeah, it happens to everyone.

1106
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,960
You know, you can do better.

1107
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,520
You're very smart, you're naturally funny,

1108
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:22,080
so had you eased up on
doing the perfect impersonation,

1109
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:26,920
it would have allowed Pixie Polite
to sort of emerge through that.

1110
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,040
All right.
Well, thank you, Pixie.

1111
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,240
- Thank you, all.

1112
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,920
- Thank you, ladies.

1113
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,320
I think we've heard enough.

1114
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:37,640
Now while you untuck in the workroom,
the judges and I will deliberate.

1115
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,240
You may leave the stage.

1116
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,760
[upbeat music]

1117
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,160
- Oh, yes.

1118
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,000
Thirsty tonight.

1119
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,840
- Oh!

1120
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,040
My testicles are going to explode.

1121
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:57,400
[all sighing and groaning]

1122
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,720
[playing off-key]

1123
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,280
- I'd just like to make it known
that I found my USP:

1124
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,840
playing the flute and snaking the game.

1125
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,800
Fashion! [cheering]

1126
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,200
If I go home tonight,

1127
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,360
that comment, fuck me against a wall.

1128
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,880
[chuckles]
Somebody, please.

1129
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,080
For RuPaul to say that
it's one of the most incredible outfits

1130
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:24,880
to ever walk the stage,
I'm actually lost for words.

1131
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:29,560
It's just...

1132
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,000
[sighs]

1133
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,800
What a fucking wimp.
[laughs]

1134
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,720
Oh, so emotional.

1135
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,280
Peppa, Peppa,
you got that comment too, girl.

1136
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,600
- Yeah.

1137
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,120
And we might have to lip sync now.

1138
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,320
- Yeah.
- Wow.

1139
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,760
- I'm really trying.

1140
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,040
- So much!
- Like, I have tried my best this week.

1141
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,080
And I went into it,
and probably it was one note.

1142
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,640
I was shouting, shouting, shouting,

1143
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,960
and I didn't reel it back or have levels
and peaks and valleys.

1144
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,280
Once again, it was one of those challenges
where we had to be funny.

1145
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,120
These girls have been doing drag
for 60 years.

1146
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,040
I am not comfortable trying to be funny.
That's not me.

1147
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,080
So you know what?
Looking back at this,

1148
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,360
I am proud of myself.

1149
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,400
- I really think
we all deserve to be here.

1150
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,760
[dramatic stinger]

1151
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,400
[Pixie slurping]

1152
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,680
I mean, apparently--
well, not that I'm bringing it up again.

1153
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,800
- We do love you.
- I know. And I know that very much so.

1154
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,040
- You should have gone home,
but we love you.

1155
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,760
[laughter]

1156
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,440
- Still here, bitch.

1157
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,360
- How do you feel, Danny,
about your critiques, my babes?

1158
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,680
You looked gorgeous tonight.

1159
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,520
I have to say,
I think you've always shied away

1160
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,800
from going glam and beautiful

1161
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,640
because you yourself
don't feel glam and beautiful.

1162
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:41,080
But know that tonight, you are stunning.

1163
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,720
- Thank you.
I did feel it when I put it on.

1164
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,440
I was like,
oh, girl, look a bit all right.

1165
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,120
[laughing]

1166
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,800
I'm not a gorgeous drag queen.

1167
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,160
I'm a clown, I'm silly, I'm--

1168
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,320
I'm a potato.

1169
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,880
But I felt it. It was nice.

1170
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,200
These are happy emotions.

1171
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,920
What's going on with Pixie-poo?

1172
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:04,160
- In terms of the critiques,
it's nothing I didn't know.

1173
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,560
I had nice stuff from Ru.

1174
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:10,640
Mad to think that Ru has probably been
following me on my journey.

1175
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,600
And I just hope I'm not disappointing her.

1176
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:19,200
It was very emotional to hear her
say how proud she is of me

1177
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,680
as, um--ooh.

1178
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,000
Means the world, to be honest.

1179
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,560
I've always doubted myself.

1180
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,800
But I knew coming into this competition,

1181
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,960
I have what it takes to
get to that top three.

1182
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,720
Honestly, if I don't get there,

1183
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,440
it just validates every negative thought
and opinion

1184
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,800
I've ever had about myself,

1185
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,440
anyone else has ever had about me
or about my drag,

1186
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,640
and I'm not going to do it.

1187
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:46,320
I'm not going home.

1188
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,680
Period.
- Round of applause.

1189
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,960
- Isn't that part of the hard time
we give ourselves as well, though?

1190
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,280
So like, I absolutely want to go forward.

1191
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,680
I want to continue showing off.
I'm having so much fun.

1192
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,800
I might even be getting
a little bit competitive,

1193
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,440
which is very, very unlike me.
- Might be?

1194
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,960
- I think I've almost been viewing
the competition element as a flaw.

1195
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
- Me, Cheddar Gorgeous,
community icon?

1196
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,600
I couldn't possibly be.

1197
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,720
And what I haven't been doing
is appreciating that

1198
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,960
actually it's something really fun
that we're all doing together.

1199
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,320
Competition doesn't have to be mean.

1200
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,080
Competition can be a great laugh.

1201
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,280
Oh, my God.
Oh, it's all kicking off in me head, now.

1202
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,920
[high-pitched squeaking]

1203
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,400
- Oh, aye, what's this all about?

1204
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,560
- Oh, God.
- What's going on?

1205
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,000
- What is this?

1206
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,480
It better not be another twist.

1207
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,320
- I'm all gamed out.

1208
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,240
- No!

1209
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,040
JONBERS' FAMILY (ON TV):
Hello there, lovey!

1210
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,200
JONBERS' MOTHER (ON TV):
So proud of everything you do,

1211
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,560
especially for getting so far
in this competition.

1212
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,080
JONBERS' FATHER (ON TV):
Your dreams are coming true.

1213
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:51,480
I am very proud of you
and all you've achieved.

1214
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,120
I love you and miss you very much.

1215
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,800
JONBERS' BROTHER (ON TV):
And come home soon,

1216
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,760
but not too soon.
- [chuckles]

1217
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,440
JONBERS' FAMILY (ON TV):
Bye, now! Bye.

1218
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,120
- Love you.
- I love you too.

1219
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,600
- Jonbers, your brother's fit.
[laughter]

1220
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,640
- Go fuck yourself.

1221
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,240
- I don't even fucking know 'em
and I'm crying.

1222
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,160
- Oh, I just love them so much.

1223
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:16,520
I haven't seen my parents in
a good few weeks now, and it's so...

1224
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,000
[sighs]
It's so nice to see them.

1225
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:22,400
And to hear their excitement is just--
it's really putting a fire in my--

1226
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,920
underneath my hole.
[laughs]

1227
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,600
I look terrible!

1228
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,560
- It's all right.
It's blended your makeup.

1229
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,480
[laughs]

1230
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,040
JAMES (ON TV):
Hi, Michael. It's me.

1231
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,400
I really miss you.

1232
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,240
You're such an inspiration not just to me

1233
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,760
but to so, so many people.

1234
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,120
And I know that everyone
is just so excited

1235
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,360
to see you on the show.

1236
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,920
There'll be so many cuddles
waiting for you when you get back.

1237
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,680
I love you. And I'll see you soon.

1238
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,880
- First time we've ever spent
any actual like, real time apart.

1239
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,520
- Mm.

1240
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,280
- Very in love, so.
- Mm.

1241
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,880
- It feels ever more important

1242
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,800
to stay in it till the end now.

1243
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:06,080
I really feel like I have done
my born family

1244
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:09,760
and my chosen family,
my drag family proud.

1245
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,960
He's dead fit, isn't he?

1246
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,840
- Yeah. He's really well spoken, too.

1247
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,440
JAMES (ON TV):
Black Pep-Peppa, baby!

1248
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,120
It goes without question
how proud I am of you.

1249
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,640
Anyone that meets you is just so lucky
to have you in their lives.

1250
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,200
You are my best friend,
and you truly deserve this.

1251
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,520
So bring it home, baby.

1252
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,360
I love you. Mwah!

1253
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,800
- I love him so much.

1254
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,560
That is one of my best friends
in the world.

1255
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,080
He was on "Glo Up,"
and I met him, like, a year ago,

1256
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,800
and we just became so close.

1257
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:53,560
Like, he's the one who gave me all
the fucking makeup I have here right now.

1258
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,320
James knows me so well.

1259
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,240
I'm sure they really want me
to fight till the very end,

1260
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,960
and I am going to put up the biggest fight
that "Drag Race" has ever seen.

1261
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,480
PIXIE'S FATHER (ON TV):
Hi, Mark.

1262
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,520
PIXIES MOTHER (ON TV):
Hi.

1263
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,920
PIXIE'S FATHER (ON TV):
We're missing you.

1264
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,800
It seems very strange
not seeing you for all these weeks.

1265
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,920
We're very proud of you.

1266
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,480
You've worked so hard.
PIXIES MOTHER (ON TV): Very hard.

1267
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,120
PIXIE'S FATHER (ON TV): We always knew
you'd be a star one day.

1268
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,880
You always said it.

1269
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,640
PIXIES MOTHER (ON TV):
I've got one of your first autographs

1270
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,520
of your first performance as well.

1271
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,720
[laughter]

1272
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,120
PIXIE'S FATHER (ON TV):
We love you very much,

1273
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,200
and make sure you bring that crown home.

1274
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,280
PIXIES MOTHER (ON TV):
Yeah.

1275
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,320
PIXIE'S FATHER (ON TV):
Absolutely.

1276
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:37,880
- [crying]

1277
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,880
- You OK, baby?

1278
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,160
- You good, girl?

1279
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,480
You feeling all right?

1280
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,000
- I don't know.
I don't have any words to describe.

1281
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,320
[sighs]

1282
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,600
I know how proud they are of me,

1283
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,240
but they're quite private people as well,

1284
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,560
so knowing that
they've put those feelings out there,

1285
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,360
it was perfect to have that.

1286
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,400
DANNY: Sorry, Danny.
No one wanted to send you one.

1287
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,080
[laughter]

1288
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,600
JOE (ON TV): Hi, Pudding.

1289
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,960
I miss you so much.

1290
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,320
And, oh, your doll has missed you as well.

1291
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,240
I couldn't get her the whole video
'cause she won't sit still,

1292
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,360
but, you know, just wanted to say hi.

1293
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,520
I want to tell you how proud
I am of you, Daniel.

1294
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,600
You know, you've sacrificed so much.

1295
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,400
Now look at you.
You know, you're a Ru girl.

1296
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,560
And I just have to tell you
how honored I am

1297
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,960
to have been able to share
that journey with you.

1298
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,320
I love you, and I'll see you soon.

1299
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,400
- [crying]

1300
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,840
Yeah, he's honestly, he's me best mate
in the whole world as well.

1301
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,800
And he had my shirt on, the bastard.

1302
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,520
[laughter]

1303
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:50,520
I am just so happy to see Joe.
He supports me in every which way.

1304
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,000
So to hear him give me
those words of encouragement,

1305
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,440
it's just--it's emotional,
and it's what I needed right now.

1306
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,720
- Let's have a little group hug.
- Let's have a little group, come on.

1307
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,720
- Top five, angels!

1308
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,080
all: Top five!

1309
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:09,240
- Just between us squirrel-friends,
what do you think?

1310
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,120
Let's start with Danny Beard.

1311
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,800
- Danny Beard was
the hostess with the mostest.

1312
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:17,040
That was Davina,
but Danny put Danny in it.

1313
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,240
LORRAINE: Tonight on the runway,
I loved the outfit.

1314
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,480
Ruffles for the gods.

1315
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,920
- Danny's never looked like that.

1316
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,840
- Forget Danny Beard.
More Fanny Beard.

1317
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,280
[laughter]

1318
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,320
There, I've said it.

1319
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,040
- You know,
Danny had a great night tonight

1320
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,000
because Danny set the tone
for the whole skit.

1321
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,240
All right, Jonbers Blonde.

1322
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,000
- She had a challenge that nobody else had

1323
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,560
because she had to do two characters.

1324
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,160
But it needed more coloring.

1325
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,320
It needed more ups and downs.

1326
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,600
- Yes, I know she had
two characters to play.

1327
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:47,720
But here we are. We have five girls left.
We have to split hairs.

1328
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,440
I think that it was
just too shouty for me.

1329
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,480
- Tonight on the runway, however,
that is by far the best she has looked.

1330
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,320
- And I loved the mint green.

1331
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,920
It was so fresh.

1332
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,600
- So sexy,
sauntering along the runway.

1333
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,280
- That outfit was so beautiful.

1334
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:08,440
One of my favorites ever
in the history of this series.

1335
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,920
Let's talk about Cheddar Gorgeous.

1336
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,320
- Somebody who knew what she wanted to do
when she came into this challenge,

1337
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,920
most specifically an objective
and point of view.

1338
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,920
- The lines were delivered perfectly,

1339
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,320
from the narcissism
of holding up the phone,

1340
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,680
to the hashtag delivery.

1341
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,400
And it really, really worked.

1342
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,480
- On the runway, I thought the outfit

1343
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:31,160
was like something
from a fashion runway in Europe.

1344
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,120
- You know, some girls are strong
in certain areas,

1345
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,640
but it's rare to find
someone who can do it all.

1346
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,720
She made me laugh the most, actually.

1347
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,800
All right, let's move on down
to Black Peppa.

1348
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,720
- I watched her performance.
I felt a bit frustrated.

1349
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,440
I saw where she could have gone with it,
and she didn't.

1350
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,240
- You want to talk about putting
your pedal to the metal,

1351
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,240
she was not stopping at a red light.

1352
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,120
She didn't stop--she was just going.
[laughter]

1353
00:59:55,160 --> 01:00:03,240
- On the runway, if I said I have seen
a sequined, denim-clad clown with a durag,

1354
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,400
you'd be like,
"Uh, what on Earth was that?"

1355
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,760
Black Peppa has it.

1356
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,240
- There is a place for her
in an acting challenge.

1357
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:13,760
When she puts her ability
to put an outfit together and a look

1358
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,400
and her ability
to put a character together,

1359
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,960
then she's going to be unstoppable.

1360
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,720
All right let's move on down
to Pixie Polite.

1361
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,320
- How can you out-Kim
Kim Woodburn?

1362
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:28,160
That's like trying to out-sing
Dame Shirley Bassey.

1363
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,320
- What I did like about Pixie was that

1364
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,240
even when the camera
wasn't directly on her,

1365
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,560
she was still keeping in character.

1366
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:38,160
- We got a verbatim Kim Woodburn,
which was very good.

1367
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,800
- Yes.
- It was very good. It was captivating.

1368
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,880
I enjoyed watching her,

1369
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,920
but I didn't get one step closer
to who Pixie Polite is.

1370
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,920
- But I want to take a second to say,

1371
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,760
she has worked so hard
at progressing her drag,

1372
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,200
her makeup, her looks.
I'm so very proud of her.

1373
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,160
- Silence!

1374
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,240
I have made my decision.

1375
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,560
Bring back my girls.

1376
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:02,480
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.

1377
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,600
[suspenseful music]

1378
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,720
Danny Beard.

1379
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,400
You are safe.

1380
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,960
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1381
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,840
- You may step to the back of the stage.

1382
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:20,800
[suspenseful music]

1383
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,920
Cheddar Gorgeous.

1384
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,480
This week, your Minxie was a star,

1385
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,920
but you were the real influencer.

1386
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,720
Condragulations, you are the winner
of this week's challenge.

1387
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,400
[applause]

1388
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,760
- Well done, Cheds.

1389
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:46,200
- And you've earned a coveted
Ru Peter badge.

1390
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:49,280
- [singing] Rule Britannia!

1391
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:54,200
- You may step to the back of the stage.

1392
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:01,160
- Not Cheddar Gorgeous
winning three challenges in a row.

1393
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,720
Is this what they shall
know me forever now?

1394
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,080
Cheddar Gorgeous of the four badges.

1395
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,080
- Pixie Polite.

1396
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,920
You are safe.

1397
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,440
- [sighs]

1398
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:22,200
Thank you so much.

1399
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,680
- You may join the other girls.

1400
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,600
