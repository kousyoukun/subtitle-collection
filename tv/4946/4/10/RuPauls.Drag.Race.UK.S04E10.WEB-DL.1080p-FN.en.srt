321
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,400
"I'm gonna do it my way."

322
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,240
- And now that you have
been wearing wigs and doing

323
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,800
different looks, does that open
your eyes to different ways

324
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,600
of how Danny Beard does drag?

325
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,360
- When I did that ruffles
runway,

326
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,320
I was feeling myself.
[laughter]

327
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,720
I was like--yeah, it's opened
my eyes is the answer--

328
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,880
short answer to the question.
- Right, good.

329
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,560
- I still feel very much me
throughout it, though.

330
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,400
- You have been.
- You know.

331
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,320
- You have confidence.
I think that's what it is.

332
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,920
- Yeah.
- You have a strong sense

333
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,200
of self, of who you are.
- Yeah.

334
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,520
- Where'd you get that?

335
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,080
- [sighs]

336
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,520
When I was younger,
I was really bullied,

337
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,560
and I--I wasn't me.

338
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,400
Like, year eight, I don't
know how old you are,

339
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,360
this guy made, um,
knuckle dusters with pins

340
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,400
and cut my face up.
- [gasps]

341
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,200
- And, um, my mom and dad

342
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,000
moved me from Liverpool
to the whirl

343
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,480
and then my mom sat me down and
said,

344
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,120
"This is a fresh start.

345
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,960
You can be anyone and
anything you wanna be now.'

346
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,760
And I went into that
school in year nine.

347
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,280
And the first kid that said
to me, "Hey, are you gay?"

348
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,120
I went, "Yeah, and what?"

349
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,760
And that was it, like--
- Aww.

350
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,840
- And that's when my
confidence started growing.

351
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,840
Not being afraid
to be flamboyant.

352
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,800
I remember me dad
screaming down the stairs,

353
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,360
"We're going to
a family barbecue.

354
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,640
Why are you orange?"

355
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,360
You know what I mean?
[laughter]

356
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,120
And I was like, "You don't like
me being gay."

357
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,600
And he was like, "No, I
don't like you being orange!"

358
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,800
[laughter]

359
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,560
You know?

360
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,640
- He wanted--you were
okay being gay,

361
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,080
just not orange.
- Yeah!

362
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,800
- And he's a big butch fireman.
- Aww.

363
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,600
- And listen, even in the
"The Roast" last week,

364
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,720
you did well because
you trusted yourself.

365
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,320
And that's because you have
confidence in yourself,

366
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,920
and you have done so well.
- Oh, yeah.

367
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,560
- What would it
mean to you to be

368
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,520
the UK's next drag superstar?

369
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,920
- There's never been--I don't
think a contestant like me,

370
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,440
let alone a winner like me.

371
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm a really good
entertainer and I'm a--

372
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,760
I'm a really nice
person, actually,

373
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,760
and that's what a "Drag Race"
winner should be.

374
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,680
- Well, you have been a joy
throughout this competition,

375

Everything was listened to,

And--and that philosophy will

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,200
Now you--you love fashion.

Where'd you get your
sense of style?

401
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,800
- From when I was a kid,
I always loved the '70s.

402
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,400
My mom kept a lot of her
dresses from the '70s

403
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,040
and even though
my mom would always say

404
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,040
she isn't fashionable,
she was always in,

405
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,800
like, a full-length gown,

406
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,280
like, dress to the nines.

407
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,560
My mom is so strong
and so full of love.

408
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,960
- Mm.
- What's your relationship

409
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,080
like with her?
- Oh!

410
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,480
I just--I just
love her so much.

411
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,240
She's so amazing.

412
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,080
She always believed
in me as a kid

413
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,600
and always said, "You can
do whatever you want."

414
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,440
Even though she didn't--
we didn't see eye-to-eye

415
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,280
whenever I came out as gay--
- Mm.

416
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,600
- That didn't stop the love.

417
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,400
It was hard for
a couple of years,

418
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,720
but I always needed to
trust in the process,

419
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,920
and everything would be--
would work out eventually.

420
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,400
- And what would it mean
to you to be crowned

the UK's next drag superstar?

422
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,880
- It would--it would
mean everything to me.

423
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,040
Not a lot of people in my
life have ever believed in me.

I could--I wouldn't
say voodoo ghost and I wouldn't

like, even fart talk

00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,320
And I was like," Yes, I have."

476
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,560
Then I couldn't stand up for
myself the way that I am now.

477
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,960
So, took off in the plane that
day and never looked back

478
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,400
and I just felt liberated,
and I could be queer

479
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,440
and I can live my life
the way I wanna live it.

480
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,920
- Do you talk to them?

481
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,720
- We are kind of getting
somewhere now and--

482
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,320
and my sister, she's kept
me and held me together

483
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,960
in times when I
felt like I really

484
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,720
couldn't keep it together.

485
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,520
And I keep remembering, "You
have someone else on earth

486
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,840
that really depends
on you to be strong,

487
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,960
so you cannot let them down."

488
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,240
- Aww.
- Wow.

489
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,880
- She's lucky to have you.

490
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,800
- Well, listen, that same
love you have for her,

491
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,920
you have to care for your inner
child that exact same way.

492
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,560
Life is a dance and
once you connect

493
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,720
to that rhythm, which
you know how to do,

494
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,320
it's smooth sailing.

495
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,760
- What would it mean
to you to be crowned

496
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,800
the UK's next drag superstar?

497
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:57,200
- It--I've said before, this
competition is bigger than me.

498
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,840
Right now, as we speak,
there's so many

499
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,040
that can't even live
the life that they

500
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,080
want to live because
they can't be themselves.

501
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,680
I can inspire people that
you can come from a position

502
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,480
in your life where
you're not proud of,

503
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,400
but you can take it there
just by believing in yourself.

504
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,200
- I love that.

505
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,520
- Well, I think that this is
just the beginning for you.

506
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,240
I really do.

507
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,400
- Thank you so much.

508
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,520
- Good luck to you, my darling.

509
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
- Thank you.

510
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,760
Thank you, Black Peppa.

511
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,840
Paging Dr. Cheddar.
- What?

512
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,640
- Paging Dr. Cheddar.

513
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,800
- I see you've been
in the operating theater.

514
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,520
[laughter]
- Well, this was--

515
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,720
this was the
brutality of the competition

516
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,600
really, wasn't it,
you know what I mean?

517
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,120
- You know, we spent some time
in--in Manchester last year.

518
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,280
We fell in love
with Manchester.

519
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,760
What do you love
about Manchester?

520
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,800
- One of the things I've
always adored about it

521
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,920
is that we've always had
such an amazing range

522
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,600
of drag that happens
there, and we've

523
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,320
got an amazing history there.

524
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,920
Hacienda and all
that sort of stuff.

525
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,480
- Is the Hacienda still there?

526
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,480
- No, the Hacienda is
now an apartment block.

527
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,680
- Oh, really?
Because I'd performed

528
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,240
at the Hacienda many years ago.
- Wow.

529
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,000
- I think during
the Thatcher administration.

530
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,680
[laughter]

531
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,000
- Cheddar, you in
particular, when I saw you,

532
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,440
your name on the roster,

533
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,520
I was like, Cheddar?
In "RuPaul's Drag Race"?

534
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,480
Why now?

535
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,840
- I just got to this very
strange place with drag.

536
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,920
I didn't know whether I even
wanted to be in drag anymore.

537
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,160
- Mm.
- I actually didn't

538
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,680
expect to get a call back,

539
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,160
but when I got a rundown
of what was involved,

540
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,320
I felt excited.

541
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,720
And I haven't felt
excited about drag

542
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,240
for such a long time.

543
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,200
- You've proven you're
fucking phenomenal.

544
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,960
- Thank you.
- We've seen it.

545
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,560
- And that surprised me.

546
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,120
- What surprised you?

547
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,120
- I was surprised I've
done as well as I have.

548
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:57,080
My inner voice doesn't give
me love and praise very well.

549
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,040
- You don't give yourself
that pat on the back.

550
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,240
Where did you learn
that behavior?

551
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,760
- [sighs] That's growing
up a working-class kid

552
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,360
in Birmingham, I think.

553
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,160
I learned to think not to
raise my head too far up.

554
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,520
- Mustn't grumble,
mustn't grumble.

555
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,640
- Mustn't grumble.

556
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,960
Emotions are for other people.

557
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,600
I come from
a family of helpers.

558
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,840
Very wonderful people
full of their kind of love.

559
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,640
- The challenge is to
learn to parent yourself

560
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,120
in a way that is unapologetic.

561
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,680
Are you able to do that?

562
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,960
- Well, I'll give it a try.

563
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,640
[laughter]

564
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,840
I mean, I certainly do like
the sound of my own voice

565
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,800
sometimes, as you
may have noticed.

566
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,880
- What would it
mean to you to be

567
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,960
the UK's next drag superstar?

568
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,800
- At the risk of
sounding cocky,

569
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,560
regardless of whether I
take that crown or not, um,

570
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,800
I'm gonna do exactly
the same thing,

571
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,240
which is go out there and be
100%--150% totally myself

572
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,680
and keep doing it.

573
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,840
The crown would be added
validation to that.

574
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,520
- Well, thank you so much.

575
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,800
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

576
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,960
- Have a lovely day.

577
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,800
- Bye, darling.
- Bye bye.

578
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,880
all: Hello!
- Hello, hello, hello, hello!

579
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,600
My name is Claudimar.

580
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,120
I'll be choreographing the
"Ru Megamix" for this final.

581
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,600
I'm, like, super excited.
We're gonna go in.

582
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,960
Like, you--we're talking
about four iconic tracks.

583
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,040
We are going for gold.

584
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,320
But within saying that,
why not bring

585
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,120
some dancers out for you guys?

586
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,680
Come on out.
This is Brett and Logan.

587
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,880
Oh! Hi!

588
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,560
- Something's
telling me that I'm gonna

589
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,440
enjoy this a little
bit more than I thought.

590
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,640
- So Miss Peppa, we're
about to start with you.

591
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,920
So can anybody else just take
a seat and I'll get to you guys

592
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,120
shortly, right?

593
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,360
Let's get into this.

594
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,160
- Let's get into this.

595
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,360
Anyone who knows me knows that
I always have a show, okay?

596
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,760
She loves a production.

597
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,920
Having dancers to really
bring it together

598
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,560
it's just even better.

599
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,280
- This is quite intricate,
so I want you to take

600
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,440
your time to really understand

601
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,360
every single rhythm.
- Mm-hmm.

602
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,440
- So you're gonna go dum,
ti, ti,

603
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,800
and that's to the hip.

604
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,680
So we go dum,
ti, ti to the hip.

605
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,840
- Doom, ti, ti.

606
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,320
- This is what Peppa does.

607
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,640
- From the top.

608
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,840
And we go dum, ti, ti.

609
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,360
Dum, dum, dum, ti, ti.

610
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,080
- I am at home and
I'm in my element.

611
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,640
I am feeling everything.

612
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,560
Every single move I'm
getting and I'm like,

613
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,120
"This is--this is perfect.

614
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,400
I'm loving this."

615
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,560
- Ti, ti, ti, ca.

616
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,120
That's right, Peppa.

617
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,440
You are done, my lovely.
- Yes!

618
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,600
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, thank you.

619
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,320
- Cheddar.
- Oh.

620
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,760
Oh, so you already have plans?

621
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,520
- Yeah, we do indeed.
- Oh, my, my.

622
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,320
- Oh, well, well, now I
feel suddenly at home.

623
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,720
I've been given choreo,
that's very sexy.

624
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,640
It's all a little bit sexy.

625
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,920
- And you look at him, and
then do two body ripple there.

626
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,560
Body and body.

627
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,800
There you go.
- Yes.

628
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,120
- Yeah.

629
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,680
- I've never danced
before in my life.

630
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,120

your story is so amazing,

1098
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,120
and your courage
and perseverance is

1099
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,240
really one for the storybooks.

1100
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,680
- You have fought for
your place to be here.

1101
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,360
Every time we thought
well, this might be it.

1102
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,760
You were like,
"Hell, no not tonight."

1103

There's nothing
you can't overcome

because look where you are.

- Can I be honest with you?

1106
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,000
I know you were
heartbroken when you were

1107
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,680
in the bottom two, but I used
to go, yes, 'cause I'm gonna

has just been phenomenal.

Today, I just felt like
I could do anything

and I'm so happy that you
saw that on the stage.

1120

those here in this environment.

You are so filled with

That performance was so fun.

When you did the fast-talking

This is everything to me,

And I think probably your
eye for fashion, your eye

00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:59,080
what advice would you give
to six-year-old Akeem?

watch that photo.

1233
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,000
I remember taking this
picture, and I remember

1234
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,360
being so unhappy that
I couldn't play outside

1235
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,440
with other kids,
and I just always

1236
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:21,600
was in this strict upbringing
that I just couldn't be free.

1237
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:26,600
And the things that people said
to me that they probably don't

1238
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:32,520
remember, it hurt me so much,
and I forgive them because I

1239
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,720
had to move on with my life.

1240
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,840
And I just wanna tell him
that you are amazing.

1241
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,080
You have everything
inside yourself

1242

to take you far in life,

1243
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,960

sure that you do not give up.

1244
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,960
No matter how hard things get,
you're gonna

00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,880
be able to get out of
that island where you're from,

1246
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,360
and you're gonna be able
to finally be free one day,

1247
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,680
and you're gonna finally
understand why you feel

1248
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,240
the way that you feel because
everything that you feel,

- From as early
as I can remember,

I always felt like a grown-up.

I don't know why you felt that
you had to grow up so fast.

1258
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,800
But you are not as old,

And just know that you
are surrounded by love,

surrounded by more love

00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,840
- That kid can perform.

1406
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,920
The dancing, the look,
all of it, the body.

1407
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,480
She was serving it.

1408
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,760
- There was fire there,
there was fierceness,

1409
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,120
and yet, she smiles
and after hearing

1410
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,000
just a snippet
of her backstory,

1411
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,440
she's here in the final,
that's amazing.

1412
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,200
- She has persevered.

1413
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,840
She's a fierce queen,
and she's earned her spot.

1414
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,520
- She is a star.

1415
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,720
- Will Black Pepper and
White Salt be going on tour?

1416
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,600
- Yes, it's the reunion
of Salt-N-Pepa.

1417
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,720
[laughter]
- The condiment sisters.

1418
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,240
[laughter]

1419
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,680
- Let's talk
about Cheddar.

1420
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,320
- There's something very
refreshing about a queen

1421
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:23,760
who knows who she is,
what she does, and what

1422
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,000
she can deliver really great.

1423
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,280
- In the beginning, I thought

1424
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,760
I might get bored of
perfection,

1425
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,720
but somehow, I didn't.

1426
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,680
'Cause there was always a
twist in it, a quirk in it,

1427
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,160
something to get
your teeth into.

1428
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,280
- She's intelligent,
and most importantly,

1429
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,280
she's, like, provocative
and sometimes

1430
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,240
it provokes you to think.

1431
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,920
- Looks-wise, I'm not sure
she faltered ever,

1432
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,640
and tonight, I mean,
this look was dynamic.

1433
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,720
- Not a centimeter of
it was unthought about.

1434
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,280
- I'm sure there's
influences there

1435
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,240
that I'm not clever
enough to get,

1436
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,760
but she always has a message,
and it is always detailed

1437
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,320
within an inch of its life.

1438
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,560
- She is a real pro.

1439
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,840
She has incredible.

1440
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,240
- All right, let's
talk about Danny Beard.

1441
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,240
- Tonight, in the
performance, you could

1442
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,720
tell how proud Danny was.

1443
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,160
Not only can Danny
turn a look,

1444
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,440
Danny was also pushing himself.

1445
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:18,760
He went for it and it
has been so much fun.

1446
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,120
- That's the queen
I'm queuing up in the rain

1447
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,840
to go and see--an entertainer,
a proper entertainer.

1448
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,880
- He never disappointed
in any of the challenges.

1449
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,480
And you know what?
He makes it look easy.

1450
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:32,320
To be spontaneous like that,
it takes me weeks.

1451
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,880
[laughter]

1452
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,200
- The talent is there,
but also not afraid

1453
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,840
to show the emotions,
which gives us

1454
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,040
a fully-rounded human being.

1455
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,360
- I would watch Danny
perform the phone book.

1456
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,960
- If you can find a phone book.

1457
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,680
- Do they even exist anymore?
- I don't know.

1458
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,920
- I don't even think so.
[laughter]

1459
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,560
- What's a phone?
- Exactly.

1460
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:56,160
- All right, let's
talk about Jonbers Blonde.

1461
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,160
- She has come
on such a journey

1462
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,320
and tonight was a spectacular
night for Jonbers.

1463
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:04,960
She came out here in
that incredible catsuit,

1464
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,800
killed it with
the choreography,

1465
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:11,080
and then that outfit tonight,
look how pretty she looked!

1466
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,040
Like, who is this girl?

1467
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,120
- I wish I could travel back
in time ten weeks and put a bet

1468
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,720
on Jonbers being in the final,
'cause it would've been

1469
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,560
about a hundred to one.
- Yeah.

1470
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:24,240
- It was amazing to
see how far she's come,

1471
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:28,120
and I think that's all happened
here in front of our eyes,

1472
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,440
and what a joy.

1473
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,960
- I don't think
in recent history,

1474
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,240
I can remember
a queen who's been

1475
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:36,840
able to apply these
critiques as well as she has.

1476
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,520
- To me, she's a bit
like a wind turbine,

1477
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,040
you know what I mean?

1478
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,080
You can use that wind
and use it for good

1479
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:45,880
and that's what
she did, it's true.

1480
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:51,760
- Silence, I've
made my decision.

1481
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,240
Bring back my girls.

1482
