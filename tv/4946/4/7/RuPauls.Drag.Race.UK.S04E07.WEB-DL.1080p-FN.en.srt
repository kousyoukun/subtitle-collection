1
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,360
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hey.

2
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,760
RUPAUL: Previously
on "RuPaul's Drag Race UK"...

3
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,000
We're gonna play the Snatch Game.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,600
[cheers and laughter]

5
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,800
Queen Elizabeth I, would you
consider yourself thirsty?

6
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,840
Parched.

7
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,280
[laughter]

8
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,200
- Lil Nas X.
- Bend Over.

9
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,360
RUPAUL:
Okay. All right.

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,120
Well...

11
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,680
Black Peppa.

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,440
The laughter really didn't happen.

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,120
Le Fil, your Marie Kondo
wasn't absurd enough.

14
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,480
I say touch.

15
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,200
Every time you touch something,
it spark joy.

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,800
Yeah.
Hello, Cheddar Gorgeous.

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,400
You're very smart.

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,760
- What a triumph.
- [mouthing words]

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,080
Condragulations,

20
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,560
you're the winner
of this week's challenge.

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,160
[applause]

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,520
Black Peppa, shantay, you stay.

23
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,280
Le Fil, sashay away.

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,160
[dramatic music]

25
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,760
[trills]

26
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,640
The shade is cru-el.

27
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,000
- [groans]
- Oh, Le Fil.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,440
BLACK PEPPA:
We're back in the workroom,

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,960
and I've just sent Le Fil home.

30
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,560
[sighs]

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,400
Well, I love Le Fil so much,
but I had to make sure

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,920
that I fought, because
I'm not going anywhere.

33
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,800
"Keep whipping that hair.
Smash those gender roles.

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,520
Love, Le Fil-osophical."

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,240
That performance was incredible.

36
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,760
I mean, everything's
going out of who knows what.

37
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,720
I didn't know what
was going on for half of it.

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,800
Ooh, I've seen a lot of very
peculiar performances in my time,

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,280
but Le Fil maybe takes the biscuit.

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,640
There was mud and grass flying.

41
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,040
It's like there was
a hurricane at Glastonbury.

42
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,520
I may not be a funny bitch,
but you know what?

43
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,320
I can lip-synch Le Fil
out of the competition.

44
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,280
- Ooh, girl, fighting.
- You know what?

45
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,680
'Cause you're a fierce bitch

46
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,320
and that's why you deserve to be here.

47
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,560
We love you, Le Fil.

48
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,680
ALL: We love you, Le Fil.

49
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,360
- Le Fil-osophical.
- Sweetie darling.

50
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,840
Fil came here and really showed the world

51
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,680
what he's made of.

52
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,200
Although I'm sad to see him go,
I'm super proud of him.

53
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,160
Well, girls, here we are.
Top...

54
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,400
- Here we are.
- Here we are.

55
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,160
ALL: The top six.
- Whoo!

56
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,440
Cheddar, congratulations on winning.

57
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,520
- Congratulations, well done.
- Thank you.

58
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,560
Are you taking the comedy badge away

59
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,360
from Danny now, like...
- [gasps]

60
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,840
I don't think I could ever wrestle

61
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,360
the class clown title from Danny,

62
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,160
and I wouldn't want to.

63
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,800
I'd sit on you, bitch,
and take the badge off you.

64
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,080
[laughs]

65
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,600
How did you feel this week?

66
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,720
'Cause I feel like you took
a little bit of a knock.

67
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,280
Yeah, I put a lot of pressure on me self.

68
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,360
Do you know what?
It was all right.

69
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,600
It weren't me best work,

70
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,360
but in 20 years' time,
they might be playing that clip

71
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,760
and be mistaking it for the real Cilla.

72
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,160
Oh, oh, 1.000%.

73
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,480
I mean, you know...
[laughter]

74
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,760
DANNY: Hey, I don't see this
as taking a knock.

75
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,680
I've still got three badges,

76
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,280
and there's still opportunity to get more.

77
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,400
So there's a chance.

78
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,880
But you know what?
I'm looking around now,

79
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,480
and I'm like, this is strong.

80
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,080
We all have different strengths.

81
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,280
- Yeah.
- And each of us...

82
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,480
Yours is lip-synching.

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,120
Danny.

84
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,320
Obviously.

85
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,800
What's mine?
I haven't won a badge.

86
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,880
- Yours is coasting.
- Survival.

87
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,720
[laughter]

88
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,800
Jonbers clearly has a lot to offer.

89
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,480
He's an amazing performer.

90
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,840
Survival is a very
important skill in this world.

91
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,320
But I haven't been able to pick out yet,

92
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,240
what is the essence of Jonbers?

93
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,320
Who is Jonbers?

94
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,040
Well, I'm being positive.
I'm on top for Snatch Game.

95
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,920
[all cheering]

96
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,720
Let's de-drag, girls.
I'm in so much pain.

97
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,640
- Yes.
- [screams]

98
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,520
[indistinct chatter]

99
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,360
- Oh, God.
- Top six, girls.

100
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,520
Top seven, top six.

101
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,880
Caw-caw.

102
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,760
I can see a few side eyes here now.

103
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,120
- [moans]
- Oh, my God, that is orgasmic.

104
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,640
These queens are watching me now,

105
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,360
and rightly so.

106
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,040
The fibers are fused.
[laughter]

107
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,480
I am genuinely really sorry
for these girls.

108
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,400
[pops lips] One by
one, I will send them out.

109
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,880
Make sure you do your prayers
and your Kumbaya,

110
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,520
because I'm not going anywhere.

111
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,840
JONBERS: Oh, my God.

112
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,760
DANNY: I need some more
badges on my boobies.

113
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,360
These girls need to get out.

114
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,200
- You look like Miss Piggy.
- [gasps]

115
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,800
[laughs]

116
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,440
[snorts]

117
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,880
RUPAUL: The winner crowned
the UK's next "Drag Race" superstar

118
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,200
will receive an all-expenses-paid
trip to Hollywood

119
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,160
to create their own digital series

120
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,440
with the producers
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

121
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,560
Tonight with Michelle Visage,

122
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,160
Graham Norton,
and extra-special guest judge.

123
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,280
Boy George.

124

SINGER: RuPaul's Drag Race.

best woman win

126
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,680
[tires squealing]

127
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,520
[upbeat music]

128
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,040
- Ooh.
- Come on.

129
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,640
BOTH: Whoo!

130
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,800
PIXIE:
It's a brand-new week,

131
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,160
and it's yet another chance
for all of us girls

132
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,880
to prove that we belong here
in this competition.

133
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,640
[singing] Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da

134
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,760
I'm gonna smash it.

135
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,680
I say it every week.
Do I always?

136
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,120
Maybe not, but you know what?

137
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,040
I'm confident that this week
is gonna be my week.

138
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,480
[softly] Fingers crossed]

139
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,880
Looking around, is this how
everybody imagined the top six to be?

140
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,960
Well, I certainly
didn't imagine being here,

141
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,200
but no one's surprised to hear that.

142
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,960
Dakota, self-doubt?
But honestly, like,

143
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,920
to be here right now, like,

144
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,960
I'm so immensely proud of myself.

145
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,360
Now that Snatch Game is over,

146
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,280
none of us know what to expect.

147
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,320
I think, hopefully, it's something

148
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,520
maybe a bit more tailored to my skill set.

149
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,720
Genuinely, that feeling of,
like, positivity,

150
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,480
it's not forced anymore;
It's, like, actually real.

151
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,840
Do you know what? I'm
so glad to hear that, though,

152
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,600
because at least now
you can end on a high.

153
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,640
Shut up, you bitch.
[laughter]

154
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,960
Pixie Polite
ain't so polite anymore, girls.

155
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,200
- A shady lady.
- She's getting rude.

156
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,680
I couldn't have seen a better top six,

157
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,840
and I'm really happy that it's us.

158
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,120
- Yes.
- I know. Yay!

159
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,320
[alarm blaring]
[all scream]

162
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,320
My queens, the time has come
to repay those

163
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,920
who have so unselfishly
given of their time and care.

164
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,840
So if you can't be with the ones you love,

165
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,320
drag the ones you're with.

166
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,520
[engine revs]

167
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,560
- [groans]
- Family.

168
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
- It's makeovers.
- It's family resemblance, so..

169
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
It's makeovers.
Family resemblance, girls.

170
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,520
DANNY: Are you worried?

171
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,840
It's just doing somebody else's makeup.

172
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,280
I've just got mine good.
[laughter]

173
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,280
Hello, hello, hello.

174
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,360
ALL: Hi!

175
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
- Yes.
- Whoo!

176
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,360
Now, ladykins, in a few weeks,

177
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,200
one of you will be crowned

178
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,720
the UK's next "Drag Race" superstar.

179
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,320
[gasps]

180
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,400
But no one makes it
to the top on their own.

181
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,600
It takes a village, people.
[laughs]

182
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,480
- Yes.
- True. A team of 50.

183
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,040
All of us owe a debt of
gratitude to our amazing crew

184
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,440
that works tirelessly behind
the scenes day in and day out.

185
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,240
Am I right, Mr. Cameraman?
[laughs]

186
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,320
This week, I want to honor
one group in particular.

187
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,440
I'm talking about the Queen Team.

188
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,320
[gasps]
ALL: Yes!

189
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,600
- Oh, my God.
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

190
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,840
- [laughs]
- That's exciting.

191
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,200
A group of selfless ladies
that make sure you're fed,

192
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,840
make sure your corsets are tightened,

193
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,480
and hold your hand every
high-heeled step of this competition.

194
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,880
- Oh, my God.
- Yes. I'm so excited.

195
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,320
BLACK PEPPA:
For those who don't know,

196
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,480
the Queen Team is literally

197
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,920
our backbone in this competition.

198
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,920
They do everything to make sure

199
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,040
that we are taken really well care of,

200
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,240
keeping us together from losing our shit.

201
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
Please welcome to the workroom

202
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,240
Fleur...

203
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,960
[cheers and applause]

204
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,800
Gemma...

205
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,720
[cheers and applause]

206
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,680
Lucie...

207
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,520
[cheers and applause]

208
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,000
DAKOTA:
Come on, Lucie.

209
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,920
Mystique.
[cheers and applause]

210
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,840
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

211
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,040
Oh, she's wearing a tie for the occasion.

212
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,080
Yeah.
[laughter]

213
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,680
I am.
A special occasion.

214
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,560
Olivia...

215
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,360
[cheers and applause]

216
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,600
Wendy.

217
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,600
[cheers and laughter]

218
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,080
Wendy! Oh!
[laughter]

219
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,720
Oh, my God.

220
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,440
PIXIE: They have been
so kind to us and so caring,

221
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,640
they have become our mothers

222
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,760
and our sisters and our family
while we've been here.

223
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,280
Hello, ladies.

224
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,320
ALL: Hi, Ru.

225
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,400
My queens, for this week's Maxi Challenge,

226
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,280
you'll be giving these fabulous
hardworking ladies

227
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,600
a head-to-toe drag makeover.

228
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,240
[laughs]

229
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,440
Now, this is your chance
to hold their hands for a change

230
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,880
as you share the miracle of drag.

231
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,720
[laughs wickedly]

232
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,560
What's the evil laugh for, Danny?

233
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,880
#DragRaceUK.

234
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,800
Now, since the ladies of the Queen Team

235
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,360
work with all of you,

236
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,960
I'm going to pair you alphabetically.

237
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,080
[all gasp]

238
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,760
I'm like, ga-dunk, ga-dunk, ga-dunk.

239
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,600
I don't know the alphabet.
[laughs]

240
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,040
That means, Black Peppa,
you'll be with Fleur.

241
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,640
Ah!
[laughter]

242
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,280
Cheddar Gorgeous, you'll be with Gemma.

243
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
- Gemma.
- Ah.

244
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,200
Dakota Schiffer, you'll be with Lucie.

245
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,280
[cheers and applause]

246
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,320
Danny Beard, you will be with Mystique.

247
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,160
[cheers and applause]

248
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,720
Yes, Mystique.

249
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,080
Jonbers Blonde, you will be with Olivia.

250
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,320
[gasps] Yes!

251
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,480
Yay!
[laughs]

252
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,920
My baby.
[laughs]

253
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,240
And that means, Pixie Polite,
you are with Wendy.

254
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,360
[cheers and applause]

255
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,960
I'm with Wendy.

256
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,720
CHEDDAR: They are the people
who work so hard

257
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,440
and their labor very rarely gets seen,

258
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,240
so it's gonna be really nice
just to make them feel great.

259
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,960
Queens, you can use your own drag

260
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,760
plus any of the wigs,
shoes, and jewelry provided.

261
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,960
Remember, as always,

262
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,760
the judges will be looking for

263
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,000
a strong drag family resemblance.

264
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,080
Now, racers, start your engines,

265
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,960
and may the best drag queen win.

266
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,440
[cheers and applause]

267
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,320
[indistinct chatter]

268
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,320
[screams]

269
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,080
- Baby, are you excited?
- I'm so excited.

270
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,960
I can't believe that this
week's Maxi Challenge

271
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,600
is not only family resemblance,

272
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,520
but we get to make over
the amazing Queen Team.

273
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,000
Before we look into looks...
- Yeah.

274
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,280
Have you been in drag before?

275
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,840
I've never been in drag before, never.

276
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,520
- You like a heel?
- Yeah.

277
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,200
'Cause I know got, like,
your own style backstage.

278
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,040
Well, you know, I swing both ways.

279
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,080
- [clicking tongue]
- So... yeah.

280
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,360
Which is perfect to be family Beards.

281
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,600
'Cause I think you're, like, for me,

282
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,840
the most exuberant and extrovert queen,

283
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,600
and I'm the most introvert...

284
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,080
- Yeah.
- Queen Team member.

285
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,000
Yeah, but don't think
that's gonna hold you back here.

286
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
MYSTIQUE: No.

287
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,560
Because this is about
a family resemblance.

288
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,120
- Yeah.
- I know, inside of Mystique,

289
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,480
there is an animal,
and I am gonna find it,

290
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,920
and I am gonna grab it,

291
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,040
and I'm gonna pull it onto the main stage.

292
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,120
[cat meows]

293
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,000
Are you ready to become a Schiffer, Lucie?

294
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,960
Oh, babes, I was born ready.
I can't wait.

295
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,160
You especially, like,
just kept me grounded

296
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,400
when I have been in, like...
There's been lots wobbles.

297
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,160
- Oh.
- And you've just been so good to me.

298
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,600
Babe, honestly.

299
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,760
I just can't wait to put you...
To Schiffer-ize you.

300
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,480
It's gonna be so good.
- I can't wait.

301
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,960
So you do love a day beat.

302
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,160
You've got a gorgeous day beat.

303
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,760
- I love makeup.
- Yes.

304
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,360
And I do like to put a bit on day-to day.

305
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,160
- Yes.
- But I've never done drag before.

306
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,800
Always wanted to but never ever.

307
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,320
Yes, especially, like, my makeup,

308
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,640
it's not the most, like, exaggerated,

309
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,960
but I've painted lots of people before

310
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,040
with different facial structures.

311
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,480
- Okay.
- And even just looking

312
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,640
at your face now, you are
going to look so gorgeous.

313
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,000
I am so excited.

314
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,800
Both of us being
hyper-feminine individuals,

315
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,080
it sort of feels like it was meant to be.

316
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,800
The idea I'm having is very,
like, 1960s Balenciaga.

317
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Stop.

318
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,880
The classic Dakota Schiffer experience.

319
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,360
My twin, Harry, might be
a little bit surprised

320
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,920
when I come back with a triplet,

321
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,560
but I'm looking forward
to having a new family member.

322
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,320
- Schiffer-ize me. I can't wait.
- Schiffer-ize.

323
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,000
[laughs]

324
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,480
I'm just so happy that we can
finally take good care of you,

325
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,080
which we will.
- Please.

326
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,320
And I cannot wait to turn
this whole thing around.

327
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,640
[laughs]

328
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,200
I am paired with the lovely Fleur.

329
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,320
We share such a special bond.

330
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,360
Baby, this is a pairing, okay?

331
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,320
- I'm super excited.
- Okay.

332
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,760
But I'll be real with you, Peppa.

333
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,080
- Yeah.
- One of the fears I have

334
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,480
is that from when I came out,
I ditched the heels,

335
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,840
I put on some lovely black boots...
- Yeah.

336
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,120
And I haven't looked back since.

337
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,200
Okay.

338
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,840
So when it comes to walking in heels,

339
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,840
that's not my forte.
- Okay.

340
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,640
So even when I was trying to be straight,

341
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,760
honestly, like, even then...
- You didn't like heels.

342
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,920
I didn't like heels.
Heel no.

343
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,080
Okay.
Well, we will work on that.

344
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,280
I am concerned about Fleur
not wearing heels.

345
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,320
My brand is all about the high heels

346
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,680
and the walk,

347
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,880
but don't worry, baby.
You're in good hands.

348
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,320
I'm gonna make sure I Peppa spray you up.

349
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,080
You're gonna be fine walking with me.

350
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,440
You know, I think you're incredible.

351
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,320
Honestly.
- [laughs]

352
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,480
- How are you?
- I'm good.

353
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,800
I'm actually, like, really excited.

354
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,960
- Yeah?
- I'm not nervous.

355
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,800
- Yeah.
- I think it's just, like, anticipation.

356
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,920
You are also, I think, known out
of all the Queen Team members

357
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,080
as the one who...
- Oh, God.

358
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,520
Is gonna be bringing in
the laughs, the jokes,

359
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,480
the fun, the vibrancy...
- Oh, stop.

360
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,480
The energy.

361
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,120
Oh, no. Not me.
I'm shy.

362
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,920
- Right? I know. Exactly.
- Stop. Oh, my God.

363
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,200
Doing makeovers in drag

364
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,920
is something I've been doing for years.

365
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,480
[laughs]
CHEDDAR: The trick is

366
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,840
gonna be making our energies
complement one another.

367
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,280
I'm really excited to see
Gemma embody that

368
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,920
more kind of slow, you know, alien deity.

369
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,320
Do you have any ideas for drag names yet,

370
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,840
before we look at costumes?

371
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,160
I think we go for the cheese
and the description.

372
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,280
You are 100% energy all the time.

373
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,200
- Yeah.
- What's a better word for energy?

374
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,520
Annoying.
[laughter]

375
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,440
What about Brie?

376
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,280
- Stop. I love Brie.
- Brie.

377
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,480
Brie Gorgeous
because you gotta Brie gorgeous.

378
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,040
We did think about Mini Cheddar,

379
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,200
but apparently that's taken.

380
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,480
I am so excited that I got you

381
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,440
and so excited to drag you up.

382
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,640
Yes! This is gonna be great.
- Thank you.

383
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,080
It's very weird to be sat here.

384
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,360
Usually I'm very much
behind the walls of this room.

385
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,520
- I know, so...
- What the hell?

386
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,080
Now, you're always running
around after us in trainers.

387
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,520
Have you ever wore heels?

388
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,360
- Very occasionally.
- Once in a blue moon.

389
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,160
Once a year for Royal Ascot,
and that's it.

390
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,440
For Royal Ascot?
[laughter]

391
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,520
Is there anything particular
that's worrying you?

392
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,320
The runway... that moment

393
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,000
of going down the runway
is freaking me out.

394
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,080
Well, look, it freaks me out
every time, too,

395
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,120
but there's always a good energy in it.

396
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,640
My look is based on clowns,
so this is all fun.

397
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,480
There's nothing serious here.

398
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,480
My only concern in this is Olivia.

399
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,800
I want her to enjoy it
how I enjoy the runway.

400
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,120
You look after me so much
in this competition,

401
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,840
I'm gonna look after you, so you do not...

402
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,760
- Thank you very, very much.
- Have to be worried at all.

403
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,280
There's no one else
I'd rather make my drag mother

404
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,040
in this moment than you.
- Oh.

405
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,000
Like, I literally
was so elated to have, like...

406
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,680
I'm getting emotional about it.
I just love you.

407
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,280
[speaking indistinctly]

408
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,600
Wendy is like the mother hen

409
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,440
of the queens and the Queen Team.

410
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,280
She is clucking about,

411
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,520
making sure we're all happy and well fed.

412
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,800
The amount of times she's tried
to force-feed me sandwiches

413
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,560
while I'm trying to tighten my corset...

414
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,360
it's not the time, Wendy.

415
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,120
It's just like the stars have aligned.

416
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,600
I think we're a match made in heaven.

417
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,160
- Yeah, and I've just...
- I mean, you've got arthritis.

418
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,760
I have dodgy knees.
- [laughs]

419
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,760
I have every faith in you, Wens.

420
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,760
But I'm looking forward
to the whole glam look of it.

421
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,320
- Mm-hmm.
- Makeup, can't wait.

422
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,960
- Okay.
- Eyelashes, can't wait.

423
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,480
Just everything.
- Yeah.

424
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,440
- I'm just really, really...
- We'll get some big lashes on you...

425
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,520
- Yeah.
- A lovely little...

426
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,080
- Yeah.
- Lace front.

427
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,360
Wendy.
- Oh.

428
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,840
We need to choose you a drag name.

429
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,280
- I've got one idea.
- Okay, what's your idea?

430
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,720
You know I've got a big bottom, so...

431
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,120
- Yes, I do.
- My drag name is

432
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,160
Hugh, H-U-G-H,

433
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,920
Jarsse, J-A-R-S-S-E.

434
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,560
[laughs]

435
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,360
- Do you know what?
- Hugh Jarsse.

436
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,920
If you're gonna be a drag king...

437
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,600
- Yeah, okay.
- I feel like yes.

438
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,280
After this, you can go and
live your life as Hugh Jarsse.

439
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,240
[laughter]

440
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,800
We are cackling
like witches in the corner.

441
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,840
Wendy has such an infectious energy,

442
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,760
and I can't wait to walk
down that runway with her.

443
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,760
Well, let's talk about face wigs.

444
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,360
Oh, face wigs.

445
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,080
- Now...
- Looks like a merkin.

446
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,880
Yeah, a merkin for a different
set of lips, sweetie.

447
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,000
- [laughs]
- My plan of action:

448
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,040
Get Mystique comfortable
and feeling gorgeous.

449
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,160
Today is about building up her confidence.

450
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,840
So if you have the lilac beard,
I have the mint hair.

451
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,720
If you have the mint hair,
I have the lilac beard.

452
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,040
- Got you. I got you.
- You get me?

453
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,800
We are gonna look like sisters
from different misters.

454
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,160
Yeah.

455
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,000
I will try it out, but if I look at myself

456
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,240
in the mirror and I think...
[groans]

457
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Then I'll let you know.
- Yeah.

458
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,000
And don't forget, you are
a part of the Beard family.

459
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,320
Yeah.

460
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,960
So we need some hair on there.

461
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,760
You know?
- Yeah. Eyebrows.

462
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,520
Beards.

463
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,880
[laughs]
- I know. I know.

464
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,040
Please wear the beard.

465
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,440
Please wear the freaking beard.

466
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,240
[singing] Da, da-da, da-da.

467
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,720
Here we go, Mama Wendy's in the house.

468
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,200
Yes, Mama Wendy, work.

469
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,760
You look like Dakota after, like,

470
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,920
a heavy night and lots of cigarettes.

471
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,080
[laughter]

472
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,400
- This is just beautiful.
- Yes.

473
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,280
That fabric... back in the '90s,

474
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,680
my mom definitely had
some sort of, like...

475
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
Yes.

476
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,400
Accent in her bedroom that was this color.

477
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,560
It doesn't really come alive
until the person's wearing it

478
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,080
because a shift silhouette,

479
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,560
we've seen it miss and we've seen it hit.

480
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,000
- Right. Okay.
- But I think...

481
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,480
- This time, it's gonna hit.
- It's gonna absolutely hit.

482
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,440
Don't you worry.
We're gonna sell the...

483
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,560
We're gonna sell the bleep out of it.

484
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,280
- So-and-sos out of that.
- [laughs]

485
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,520
- I look like if Rod Stewart...
- [laughs]

486
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,120
Is really down on his luck.

487
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,440
- I think you look lovely.
- This is absolutely mental.

488
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,440
- Surprise, surprise, surprise.
- Ah!

489
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,840
[all cheering]

490
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,160
It's Raven, hunty.

491
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,600
[screams] Raven is in the workroom.

492
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,880
Ru wanted me to stop in
and check on your progress.

493
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,000
Is it okay?

494
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,920
ALL: Yes.
- Please.

495
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,160
She is perfection,

496
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,200
and this is definitely a moment
I'm gonna cherish.

497
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,240
Is this your first time
getting into drag, Fleur?

498
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,560
I once did, like, a drag king
thing at, like, a talent show

499
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,520
with my girlfriend,
but it was just, like...

500
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,080
It was a little bit of fun, not
actual drag, so this is huge.

501
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,880
So this is your first time
getting into, like, glam drag.

502
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,320
Yeah, yeah, big-time.

503
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,960
You have done your makeup
many, many, many times.

504
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,680
Have you ever painted anyone else?

505
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,040
- Never.
- Never?

506
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,120
I've never painted anyone else.

507
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,760
It's gonna be a club-kid route,

508
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,640
and that's something
that I'm really good at

509
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,720
'cause I love being
really artistic and stuff.

510
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,560
When you go out there, the light kind of

511
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,480
diffuses everything, and you want

512
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,320
to just have things pop a little more.

513
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,320
You do a beautiful crease,
but try cutting it a little more.

514
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,760
I can tell you have a confidence.

515
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,760
[laughs]

516
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,840
I can tell you are not nervous about this,

517
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,680
but you have never painted anyone before,

518
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,280
so I'm excited to see.

519
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,640
- Thank you.
- Bye.

520
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,760
Hi, Pixie Polite and Wendy.

521
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,560
- Hello, Raven.
- Hello.

522
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,360
You're the legend out of the Queen Team.

523
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,520
I'm not a legend.
I'm just the oldie.

524
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
[laughter]

525
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,960
And so you've been here
since the beginning.

526
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,280
Yes, season one.

527
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,640
You started season one, episode one.

528
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,600
- Yup.
- Now, out of all that time,

529
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,960
what's the weirdest thing

530
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,640
you've ever had to do for a drag queen?

531
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,880
Backstage, just before a runway,

532
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,160
I've had to bend right down
and go underneath,

533
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,720
do a popper up underneath,
and stick everything back in.

534
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,120
Yes.
- You had to po...

535
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,040
Not everything.
Just one.

536
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,680
[laughs]

537
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,080
- One bollock.
- Oh, you...

538
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,360
[laughter]

539
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,480
- Sorry.
- Wendy.

540
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,680
- Well...
- Yeah.

541
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,720
- Luckily it wasn't two.
- [laughs]

542
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,480
Now, you are gonna be doing purple?

543
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,920
We're playing on a sort of
fairy, pixie theme.

544
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,000
And we're just gonna be... you're
gonna be my mummer, aren't you?

545
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,880
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Do you do heels?

546
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,000
I do wear them out.

547
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,960
I wore some to a funeral last week.

548
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,000
That's not really out.
[laughter]

549
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,400
But okay.
[laughter]

550
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,080
All right, then I'll let
you guys get to it.

551
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,120
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you so much.

552
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,280
- Howdy.
- Hello.

553
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,080
Hi. So you won
the Snatch Game.

554
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,360
I did. Crazy.

555
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,080
Now, what do you think that
makes the other queens feel?

556
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,040
Probably a mix of fear and admiration.

557
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,560
And I'm fine with that.
- Good.

558
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,080
Now, Gemma.
- Yeah.

559
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,360
- Ever done drag?
- Well, every day.

560
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,120
- Every day is drag for you.
- You know...

561
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,400
So you are a girl
that likes to wear makeup.

562
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,720
You like to wear heels?

563
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,560
Well, yeah.
I mean, back in the day.

564
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,080
More than makeup, I feel like you have

565
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,040
the attitude of a drag queen,
which is far more important.

566
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,000
Now, Cheddar has a very eclectic

567
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,800
and avant-garde type of drag.

568
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,120
For me, a little more freeing
than just being pretty.

569
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,360
I totally agree with that.

570
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,040
I think, as prickly girls,

571
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,600
I think we're told so often to be pretty.

572
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,120
I'm gonna just throw myself
in the deep end

573
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,680
and hope for the best.

574
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,880
And you are gonna let Cheddar
do what Cheddar does best.

575
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,880
Totally. Cheese me up.
I can't wait.

576
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,800
- Thank you.
- Thanks, gorgeous.

577
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,720
See you later.
- Thanks.

578
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,040
Good luck.
Have fun.

579
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,720
Hi, Jonbers and Olivia.
- Hi.

580
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,520
- How are you?
- Great. How are you?

581
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm really well, love.
Thanks for asking.

582
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,720
[with Irish accent]
Ooh, well, you're quite welcome.

583
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,520
[laughter]

584
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,640
[normally] Now, what are you
gonna give Olivia?

585
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,120
Olivia is very like me

586
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,920
in that we don't take ourselves
too seriously,

587
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,400
so the concept that I've went
with is, like, mime clowns,

588
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,680
a black-and-white theme.

589
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,560
I'm doing it in a very chic way.

590
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,040
Yeah, I mean, that's what drag queens are.

591
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,040
- Exactly.
- We're clowns.

592
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,080
- Exactly.
- We are clowns.

593
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,120
Exactly.

594
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,600
We are the clowns of the gay community.

595
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,720
Have you ever painted anyone else before?

596
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,120
Just, like, on a night out
with her girlfriends.

597
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,800
I'm not worried,

598
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,800
but any tips would be helpful.

599
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,720
What I would say is, you know, you have

600
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,080
a very little about of space
between your nose and your lip.

601
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,200
- Yeah.
- I would bring the contour up a little,

602
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,400
and then your brow, just
make it arch a little bit more.

603
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,880
Arch them. Yeah.

604
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,240
Now, have you ever done drag before?

605
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,960
- Absolutely not.
- No.

606
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,360
- No.
- Have you tucked ever?

607
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,920
I don't think I've ever needed to.

608
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,680
[laughter]

609
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,040
So are you willing to go all in?

610
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,280
I really am.
I'm... yeah.

611
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,360
I'm up for anything.

612
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,120
You are gonna look absolute

613
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,240
charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent.

614
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,520
- Yes.
- Yes.

615
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,680
All right, now, get the fuck out of here.

616
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,000
[laughter]

617
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,040
Now, Lucie, you've been here
since day one.

618
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,120
That's right.
Series one to four.

619
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,200
Honestly, it doesn't feel like a job.

620
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,120
It feels like a dream to be here,

621
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,480
especially as a queer person
in this space,

622
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,760
you know, that's watched
the show and that loves it.

623
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,200
Like, it really is amazing.

624
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,920
- Well, you just got a raise.
- [laughs]

625
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,840
- Thank you.
- Now, Dakota,

626
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,200
you are not... you are a natural girl.

627
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,320
Are you gonna get in there
with Lucie's makeup

628
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,440
or just do a pretty natural beat?

629
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,960
The judges have commented
on the subtlety of my drag.

630
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,280
So we're gonna do
a quite high-contrast eye

631
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,640
because I know the judges
want to see transformation.

632
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,880
This is just a chance to maybe
go in a little bit more, saying,

633
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,800
"Yeah, I know I'm pretty,
but look what else I can do."

634
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,000
Yes.

635
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,760
Use all the crayons in the crayon box.

636
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,560
I know Raven's aesthetic
is more exaggerated than mine,

637
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,200
so I'll happily take
those suggestions on board.

638
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,400
- Good luck.
- Thank you so much, Raven.

639
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,320
All right, come on over,
Danny and Mystique.

640
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,520
Mystique, you showed up with a drag name.

641
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,880
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

642
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,320
This looks a lot shorter than normal.

643
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,720
I keep it trim for drag,

644
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,800
but with the magic of custom lace...

645
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,280
Ah.

646
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,640
A custom lace beard.

647
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,680
Is Mystique gonna be a bearded queen?

648
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,640
I'm gonna try them on
and see how I feel with them.

649
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,280
So what are your reservations
when it comes to that?

650
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,280
As you can see, I'm not
the most feminine of women.

651
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,600
I'm often mistaken for a male person.

652
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,360
It is one of those things
that I'm still a bit icky with.

653
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,400
The thing that I think
people still don't understand

654
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,200
about drag is that it has
always been about

655
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,840
fuck societal norms on gender.

656
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,160
I'm decorating myself.

657
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,520
Mystique's spoken honestly and candidly,

658
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,320
and I really appreciate it.

659
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,040
I don't want to push her
into feeling uncomfortable.

660
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,440
I cannot wait to see what you turn out.

661
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,000
DANNY: I hope that she can,
by the end of tomorrow,

662
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
feel sexy and have a bit of facial hair

663
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,280
and know that she is a superstar.

664
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,920
I want to be, like, out, in, out.

665
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,880
Shake it all about.

666
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,560
The secret to wearing heels...

667
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Yeah.

668
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,240
Is that they're not supposed
to be comfortable.

669
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,440
Yeah, okay.
I feel that.

670
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,240
But no one needs to know
that they're not comfortable.

671
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
Okay.

672
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,000
So Fleur has not worn heels

673
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,680
for a long, long, long time.

674
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,640
And this is her moment to feel that power.

675
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,920
Five, six, seven, and...

676
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,960
Look at you.
- How am I doing?

677
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,600
- Whoa, girl.
- That actually feels okay.

678
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,960
You're doing good.
Ah!

679
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,360
That actually feels all right.

680
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,680
Fleur, you're in my house now, baby.

681
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,200
Five, six, seven, and...

682
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,480
Yeah, but with a bit more grace.

683
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,840
- Okay, more grace.
- Yeah.

684
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,640
Gosh.

685
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,360
CHEDDAR: Good?
GEMMA: Yeah, that's great.

686
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,720
I'm a bit worried you might be liking this

687
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,360
a little bit too much, Gemma.

688
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,880
Come on. Take a queue in
my little shoe shop, my angel.

689
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,560
What shoe size are you, my darling?

690
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,200
- I'm, like, a seven and eight.
- You're a seven, eight?

691
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,360
- Seven, eight. Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

692
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,320
My nature in life is to be

693
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,480
quite a positive and nurturing person.

694
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,400
I want to get this look on her
as fast as possible...

695
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,960
I should've shaved my toes.
[laughs]

696
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,800
Shave... shaved your toes.

697
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,280
And just really encouraging Olivia.

698
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,320
OLIVIA: Oh, my God.
JONBERS: Come on.

699
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,320
OLIVIA: Is that right?

700
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,280
No, yeah, that's definitely right, Olivia.

701
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,000
Come on.
[laughter]

702
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,520
Are these gonna fit you?

703
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,400
I think you might be an eight, angel.

704
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,320
Seven. Six and a half.

705
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,360
Are you too big for these shoes?

706
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,880
- Well, okay, basically...
- And I got a smaller fit than you.

707
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,920
No, no, so I say that I'm a seven

708
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,080
when I'm probably a nine.
[laughs]

709
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,000
Those feet are boats.

710
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,560
- I feel like...
- Am I putting Bigfoot into drag?

711
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,120
She has lied about her shoe size.

712
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,960
She is a drag queen through and through.

713
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,320
[laughs]

714
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,880
- Stop.
- No!

715
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,880
I learn quite quickly
when people explain things.

716
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,800
Oh, my God.
- It's literally just walk.

717
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,560
Walk. Glide.
Pretend like you're gliding.

718
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,920
Oh, no.

719
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,840
- Oh, Mystique.
- Oh, my God.

720
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,880
- There she is.
- There she is.

721
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,440
- [laughs]
- Making her into a mummer.

722
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,480
Oh, my God.

723
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,920
She's been to Turkey, bitch.

724
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,480
Why is it weirdly bulgy here?

725
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,280
Pixie, love.

726
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,120
Please.

727
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,040
My sister has got the queen
of the Queen Team, Wendy,

728
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,320
and honestly, right now, she looks like

729
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,000
she's just rolled through
B&amp;M with Velcro

730
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,400
strapped to her body and come out

731
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,440
with whatever's on the other side.

732
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,480
I'm like, there's camp love,
and there's...

733
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,080
[sighs]
Gay vomit.

734
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,120
When did you come out?

735
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,560
I didn't come out until I was about 21.

736
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,240
I was just so terrified.

737
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,400
You know when you lose an eyelash?

738
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,880
- Yeah.
- You make a wish.

739
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,040
I'd literally wish, like, to be straight.

740
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,960
I just wanted to... to fit in.

741
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,280
How is it with your parents?

742
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,360
My mother has always been,
like, my biggest cheerleader,

743
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,040
so I think I was just
really scared of losing her

744
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,880
as that person in my life.
- Yeah.

745
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,040
But she now, like, celebrates
my queerness so much.

746
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,040
She comes to every single
football match I play in.

747
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,360
Oh, yeah.

748
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,560
She started watching "Drag Race,"

749
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,920
and I feel like through watching this,

750
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,880
she's just learned so much
about queerness, full stop.

751
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,720
That is so amazing
that your mom supports you.

752
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,720
Yeah.

753
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,160
I just remember feeling like

754
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,080
I just could never, ever tell anyone.

755
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,800
I remember seeing my dad.

756
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,000
He would watch, like, in the
news, things that would happen

757
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,280
to queer people, and he would be like,

758
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,760
"Batty man, them.

759
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,720
How could you, you know,
love a guy?"

760
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,960
And I'd be in my room just,
like, trembling like shit.

761
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,800
Like, I'm literally one
of those people, you know?

762
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,560
Growing up in Saint Martin,

763
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,160
it literally is paradise.

764
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,240
I am so fortunate to be from somewhere

765
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,680
where people go on vacation.

766
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,640
But it's a very religious place,

767
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,160
so being gay is obviously a no-no.

768
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,480
I had to go to church
almost every day of the week.

769
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,840
You know, you're brought
in a Christian background

770
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,400
knowing that homosexuality is wrong.

771
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
You just feel like
everything that you are,

772
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,680
you know, life is against.
- Yeah.

773
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,040
It's very, very difficult

774
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,920
to be out of the closet
in the island where I'm from.

775
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,120
Because Saint Martin is so small,

776
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,600
there's nothing you can do

777
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,840
that kind of goes under the radar.

778
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,880
You find yourself having
to hide and pretend.

779
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,520
You have no support.

780
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,600
You have no one on your side.

781
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,920
I just couldn't tell anyone, and
I felt like I couldn't trust anyone.

782
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,920
I'm so sorry.

783
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,760
I know it sounds ridiculous,
but this is a time

784
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,440
when I was like, you know,
"I'm gonna be rebellious."

785
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,200
I started sneaking out the house,

786
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,760
going to the underground gay scene.

787
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,320
There was, like, one gay club
where I'm from.

788
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,360
So someone in the club was spying on me

789
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,160
and sent my mom a video.
- That's horrible.

790
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,040
I remember my dad
would ask me on the spot,

791
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,960
"Are you gay?
Like, I need an answer now.

792
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,960
"Are you gay or not?

793
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,440
"Because people are telling
me this, and I need to know.

794
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,360
I don't want no gay son
in my house."

795
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,320
Imagine being on the spot,
like, if I had to tell him,

796
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,480
I'd probably get kicked out the house.

797
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,200
- Yeah.
- I'd be homeless.

798
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,440
Someone who's gay in the Caribbean,

799
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,800
it's just like, you don't win.

800
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,920
We... we're constantly in fear.

801
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,120
It's really scary, like,
being in a household like that,

802
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,000
where it's so religious that

803
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,080
you don't even feel worthy of living.

804
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,000
I was so, like, suicidal already.

805
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Like...

806
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,920
[crying]

807
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,320
I remember going to church,
and I was like,

808
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,840
"Can I just be straight?"

809
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,760
People think,
"Oh, you choose to be gay."

810
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,720
Why the hell would I want to put myself

811
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,880
through all that turmoil, you know?

812
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,400
[sniffles]

813
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,520
[sighs]

814
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,240
It really put things
into perspective for me

815
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,920
that you know what?

816
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,080
If I'm gonna stay here and feel like this,

817
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,720
this is not gonna go anywhere,
and I need to leave.

818
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,960
And thankfully for me,
I was blessed with a brain.

819
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,600
After years

820
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,600
of all the bullying and all of that,

821
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,560
I decided it was time to leave.

822
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,760
Luckily I was a nerd

823
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,960
and got a scholarship
to come to Coventry University,

824
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,640
and I studied biomedical science.

825
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,800
Graduated with my master's,

826
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,040
and I got a first-class degree.

827
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,680
It was like a shift... a shift
happened in me.

828
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,320
I started dressing differently.

829
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,000
I started acting more openly.

830
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,880
When someone would ask me,
"Are you gay?"

831
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,640
I'd be like, "Yeah."
- My God.

832
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,920
How did that feel the first time?

833
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,680
I felt so liberated.

834
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,320
It was such a good feeling.

835
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,280
I'm not, like, this shame label
that people wanted me

836
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,240
to feel like when I was back home.

837
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,160
I realize I have so many
of my years to catch up on.

838
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,320
I look at a queer person here
who's younger than I am,

839
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,680
and they're fully realized.

840
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,480
And I'm like,
"Why am I not like them?"

841
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,680
You know, it's because
I've been holding back

842
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,760
all of who I was all this time.

843
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,600
I have no regrets coming to the UK.

844
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,120
And I didn't feel the love from my family,

845
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,080
and I had to find that love within myself.

846
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
And I think that's why
I have such a good drive.

847
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,960
I'm just so proud of myself.

848
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,520
Seeing where I came from to being here,

849
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,000
like...
[chuckles]

850
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,880
You're so strong, and the fact
that you're here right now

851
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,280
being you and showing everyone
who Peppa is...

852
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,120
- Yeah.
- Just is incredible.

853
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,560
BLACK PEPPA: The relationship
I have with my family now,

854
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,040
although it's not the best,

855
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,840
recently my mom did reach out.

856
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,000
It will be a long process,

857
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,240
but I know that there is hope,

858
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,480
and I can see the relationship
igniting slowly again.

859
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,000
For me, it's an honor to be able

860
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,920
to have family resemblance,
like, with you, honestly.

861
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,120
BLACK PEPPA:
I might cinch you to death,

862
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,600
but, you know, forgive me for now.

863
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,320
[laughter]

864
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,040
[gasps] [laughter]

865
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,680
- Whoo!
- Let's go!

866
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,840
Yeah.
[laughs]

867
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,880
- Yes.
- Family.

868
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,520
It's elimination day,
and today we're making over

869
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,440
the "RuPaul's Drag Race UK" Queen Team.

870
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,760
WENDY: Are you putting
a wig cap on me?

871
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
PIXIE: We'll put a wig
cap on you today, yeah.

872
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,680
Oh!

873
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,200
JONBERS: It's weird
having 12 people back here.

874
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,400
I've got six more
drag queens to deal with.

875
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,760
Too many... [singing]
Too many drag queens.

876
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,280
Too many drag queens [chuckles]

877
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,440
Welcome to the salon.

878
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,280
What are we thinking?
Highlights? Lowlights?

879
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,520
[laughs] Highlights, I think.

880
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,040
Someone been treating you bad?

881
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,320
At the moment,
where it stands this morning,

882
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,280
Mystique is not very comfortable

883
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,920
wearing the facial hair.

884
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,480
Got the lilac and the mint.
- Oh, nice. Yeah.

885
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,680
So they pick right up through the...

886
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,200
Perfect.

887
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,480
And then we go round the edges like I do,

888
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,120
so we can see it's a mask.
- Yeah.

889
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,960
So all your gorgeous skin tone

890
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,680
is still gonna be on show
so we still know who you are.

891
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,720
Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

892
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,160
Because that's important.

893
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,840
I'm hoping once I've beat her face

894
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,160
to within an inch of its life,

895
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,720
she is gonna feel a billion dollars.

896
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,240
And when she feels a billion dollars,

897
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,520
she'll say,
"Eh, throw the beard on."

898
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,360
FLEUR: We're doing
a similar face, I think.

899
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,680
Are we?
BLACK PEPPA: Yeah.

900
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,480
Yeah, I'm doing, like, a clown white face.

901
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,400
Oh, so you're doing
a Danny Beard look tonight.

902
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,680
That's interesting.

903
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,240
BLACK PEPPA: It's not
a Danny Beard look, though.

904
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,200
You didn't invent it.
Sorry to break it to you.

905
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,160
So first it was clash of the blobbies.

906
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,240
Now it's clash of the clown makeup.

907
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,520
Am I pressed?
Absolutely not,

908
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,320
'cause my face gonna be
completely different from theirs.

909
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,560
They're called similarities
'cause they're similar.

910
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,720
They're not the same, so...

911
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,120
So are you gonna
glue down my eyebrows now?

912
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,880
We are, yeah.

913
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,960
I'm feeling very confident.

914
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,400
I know that I can...
[clicks tongue]

915
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,680
Stamp my face straight onto Wendy's mug.

916
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,360
I can't wait to be a fairy princess.

917
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,400
I know.

918
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,680
I'm not one who goes subtle
with the makeup,

919
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,360
so I don't think she's really
ready for what she's in for.

920
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,560
Have you got a good idea
of what you're doing?

921
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,520
Me?
WENDY: Yeah.

922
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,280
- Yes, dear.
- No, I mean, color-wise,

923
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,560
not, like, do you know how to do drag?

924
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,640
Yes.
No, we're gonna...

925
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,400
JONBERS:
"Do you know how to do drag?"

926
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,520
[laughter]

927
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,600
I didn't mean that.
[laughter]

928
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,440
Just make sure we get
all the details right.

929
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,800
Oh, I just love it so much.

930
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,000
Gemma has some of the most

931
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
wonderful real estate for makeup
I've ever worked on.

932
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,240
It's great.
I get to just really focus

933
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,760
on making the look really over the top

934
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,200
and really extravagant
and really gorgeous.

935
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
GEMMA: [stifles laugh]

936
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,640
CHEDDAR:
Stop laughing,

937
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,400
or else, it'll be printed
on your face forever.

938
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,200
How are you feeling today?
How are you...

939
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,280
I'm good.
I'm good.

940
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,160
I'm feeling a lot less nervous
than I was yesterday morning.

941
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,400
Yeah. I mean, it's a big...

942
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,840
Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

943
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,880
You're normally on the
other side of the camera...

944
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,080
- Exactly.
- So, like...

945
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,600
I think it's normal to be a bit nervous,

946
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,080
but I feel a lot more at ease.

947
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,600
DAKOTA:
I was so excited

948
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,800
to be paired with you, Luce.

949
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,640
We've, like, talked so much about, like,

950
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,720
our fashion and makeup references.

951
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,840
And, like, I knew that, like,

952
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,480
it was gonna be a perfect match.

953
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,400
LUCIE: Aw, babe, I feel
the same about you, honestly.

954
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,680
[laughs]

955
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,320
I've always felt hyperfeminine...

956
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,800
DAKOTA: Yeah.
- Just in the way that I am

957
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,920
and the way that I present myself.

958
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,160
One of the funny things
when I first came out

959
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,320
was that my mom

960
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,200
was really shocked because
I'd always been really girly.

961
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,480
DAKOTA: Yeah.

962
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,880
So she sort of said to me,

963
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,600
"But, you know,
there were no signs."

964
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,280
DAKOTA: Yeah.
- "I didn't get a clue."

965
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,720
Exhibit... yeah, no clue.

966
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,480
I mean, passing privilege
is a different conversation

967
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,160
in trans identities,
but in sexuality-wise,

968
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,160
if you don't fit those stereotypes,

969
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,640
then of course your parents
are in for a shock,

970
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,520
because all they've seen
is certain portrayals

971
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,800
of sexual identities on television.

972
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,520
Absolutely.

973
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,480
As someone that I think
really only does drag

974
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,320
because, you know, it was

975
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,160
an outlet for that femininity

976
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,080
that I wasn't allowed
to express as a child,

977
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,400
it's so interesting
hearing Lucie's perspective.

978
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,120
But I think, you know,
now as I've got older

979
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,760
and I'm sort of navigating my own

980
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,000
kind of lesbian identity...
- Yes.

981
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,600
Like, I really feel proud
to be quite femme-presenting.

982
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,000
- Yes.
- And I think that, you know,

983
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,560
there's so much more
representation now on telly.

984
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,560
You know, we haven't seen so many

985
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,200
different queer identities,
I think, on "Drag Race" before

986
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,920
in one room, and it is just
a pleasure to be part of that.

987
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,520
I'm happy I get to share this with you.

988
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,560
I'm just so, so excited
to wear that massive wig.

989
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,520
[laughs]

990
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,960
- Gemma.
- Yeah?

991
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
This is the quietest I think
I've heard you, love.

992
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,400
Are you feeling all right?
- Oh, I know.

993
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,120
Honestly, Cheddar's just
enjoying the process

994
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,360
and I'm just enjoying Cheddar
enjoying the process.

995
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,160
WENDY: We're enjoying
the peace, aren't we?

996
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,800
[laughter]

997
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,280
Everyone's really happy today
in the workroom.

998
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,680
I think they've all forgotten

999
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,520
that it's actually elimination day.

1000
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,480
You wear falsies, don't you?

1001
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,480
Oh, yeah.
I'm from Essex, darling.

1002
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,400
[laughs]

1003
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,080
Everybody's so good
in the contest right now.

1004
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,280
It's anyone's guess
who might be sent home.

1005
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,080
There's no chaff here, just chuff.

1006

[RuPaul's "Cover Girl"]

1007

RUPAUL: [laughs]

1008
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,600
[singing]
Cover girl.

1009
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,800
Put the bass in your walk.

1010
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,360
Head to toe.

1011
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,280
Let your whole body talk

1012
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,520
[applause]

1013
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,400
And what.

1014
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,680
Welcome to the main stage
of "RuPaul's Drag Race UK."

1015
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,000
Due to circumstances
beyond anyone's control,

1016
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,040
RuPaul is unable to join us tonight,

1017
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,720
but Mama Ru is watching
via a live video link.

1018
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,320
So now, with Ru's blessing,

1019
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,440
the show must go on.

1020
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,600
Let's say hello to national
treasure Graham Norton.

1021
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,080
Graham, have you ever done drag?

1022
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,200
Done drag?

1023
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,360
I mean, I've had sex with a
drag queen. Does that count?

1024
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,640
Yeah, it does.

1025
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,160
Then yes, I have.

1026
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,640
Thought so.
Did it burn?

1027
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,040
[cymbal crashes]
- [laughs]

1028
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,680
And joining us on the panel

1029
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,000
is "Drag Race" royalty, Raven.

1030
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,480
Hi, Raven.

1031
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,600
Hi, beautiful.

1032
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,200
Now, have you ever done drag?

1033
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,080
No, I prefer a more natural look.

1034
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,080
[laughter]
- Me too.

1035
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:24,160
And welcome the one, the only Boy George.

1036
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,080
We are so excited that you are here.

1037
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,560
I'm excited to be here.

1038
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,800
"Drag Race" without me is ridiculous.

1039
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
This week, we challenged our queens

1040
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,520
to transform
the behind-the-scenes Queen Team

1041
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,080
into Glamazons.

1042
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,600
Racers, start your engines,

1043
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,400
and may the best drag queen win.

1044
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,280

Category is drag family realness.

1046
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,320
Up first, Jonbers Blonde and Nanu Noir.

1047
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,320
Ooh.

1049
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,080
Black and white and mimed all over.

1050
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,200
JONBERS: Olivia and I are giving
vaudevillian sisters from the '30s

1051
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,160
in the silent movie era,

1052
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,680
gorgina Hollywood starlets.

1053
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,960
[laughter]
- Mime your business.

1054
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,000
[laughs]

1055
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,320
JONBERS:
Olivia's really enjoying this.

1056
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,560
It's the most fun that I've
ever had in this runway.

1057
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,080
We're clown mimes for God's sake.

1058
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,280
[laughs]

1059
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,640
MICHELLE: My kind of gal.
Girl, necklace.

1060
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,600
Wink, wink.
[laughter]

1061
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,320
JONBERS:
I'm so proud of Olivia.

1062
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,640
The judges are loving it.

1063
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,120
I'm serving Graham a pint of Guinness.

1064
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,560
He's having a ball.

1065
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,720
MICHELLE:
Zebra, I don't even know her.

1066
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,640
Up next, Pixie Polite and Trixie Truelove.

1067
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,000
GRAHAM: It's bring
your fairy to work day.

1068
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,720
[laughs]

1069
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,320
PIXIE: We are serving
fairy garden realness.

1070
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,640
We flutter down the runway
like mother, like daughter,

1071
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,360
shaking our tits and being camp as hell.

1072
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,080
GRAHAM: I love it.
I'll take one in every size.

1073
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,880
[laughter]

1074
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,320
PIXIE: Trixie Truelove
is really doing me proud.

1075
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,880
She is embodying the trademark
Pixie Polite silliness.

1076
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,560
Bouquet, hon.
[laughter]

1077
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,160
PIXIE:
We look really good together.

1078
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,680
You know, she walked past me earlier,

1079
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,080
and I thought I was looking in a mirror...

1080
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,560
Maybe a mirror in a few years' time

1081
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,920
but a mirror nonetheless.

1082
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,440
MICHELLE:
Look at her Tinker-balls.

1083
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,920
- Very good.
- [laughs]

1084
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,440
PIXIE: She's always wanted
to be a fairy princess,

1085
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,920
and today she is a fairy queen.

1086
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,640

See you in the Toll House.

MICHELLE: Danny Beard
and Mizzy Moustache.

1089
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,240
Wait a minute.

1090
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,360
I thought I was the only beard in here.

1091
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,240
[laughter]

1092
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,560
DANNY: For this week's
drag family resemblance runway,

1093
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,520
we are serving pastel hairy princesses.

1094
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,240
MICHELLE: Ann Jillian called.
She wants her hair back.

1095
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,120
BOY GEORGE: That
hair color's beyond, though.

1096
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,440
MICHELLE: Oh, it's gorg.
- Starved.

1097
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,680
MICHELLE: Yeah.
- [laughs]

1098
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,080
DANNY:
We look like bookends.

1099
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,600
We look like family.

1100
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,200
We have gone for feathers
and little, mini handbags

1101
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,120
which say slappers on a night out.

1102
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,640
Somebody's been fisting ostriches again.

1103
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,840
GRAHAM: [laughs]

1104
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,360
That's why they put
their head in the sand.

1105
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,240
MICHELLE: [laughs]

1106
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,920
DANNY:
Mystique's coming alive,

1107
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,560
giving it beats.

1108
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,560
Oh, she is looking and feeling gorgeous.

1109
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,040
Mission accomplished.

1110
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:20,080
MICHELLE: Not by the hair
of her chinny, chin, chin.

1111
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:24,080
Cheddar Gorgeous and Brie Gorgeous.

1112
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,560
GRAHAM:
Look at the cheese selection.

1113
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,640
CHEDDAR: We are
an elemental mirror image

1114
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,880
conveying a similar
yet slightly askew energy.

1115
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,320
This mold, old thing?
No, old thing.

1116
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,640
Not mold, old thing.

1117
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,880
CHEDDAR:
We look phenomenal.

1118
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,120
Whether they're wearing makeup or not,

1119
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,680
this wonderful woman is

1120
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,200
an energy and a force to be reckoned with.

1121
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,080
Why don't you come up
and lactose me sometime?

1122
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:51,960
GRAHAM: [laughs]

1123
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,040
CHEDDAR: Brie is pulling out
all of the stops.

1124
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:58,000
She's working that runway
and showing up her mother...

1125
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,760
just as her mother requested.

1126
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,720
RAVEN: Ham and cheese.
- Where's the wine?

1127
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,680
MICHELLE:
There's no wine, Graham.

1128
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,080
Up next, Black Peppa and Chilli Peppa.

1129
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,720
These two are joined at the tip

1130
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,160
but just the tip.

1131
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,840
[laughs]

1132
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,520
BLACK PEPPA: We are
serving you conjoined twins.

1133
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,440
Just like an umbilical cord,
we are attached by our hair.

1134
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,960
[pop]
MICHELLE: Oops.

1135
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,240
GRAHAM: It's a girl.
- [laughs]

1136
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,760
Gender reveal.

1137
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,040
BLACK PEPPA: I am giving you
an amazing club-kid beat

1138
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,720
with a beautiful moustache.

1139
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,720
And you know what?
We look incredible.

1140
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,840
Umbilical coordination.

1141
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,120
These are members
of the plait Earth society.

1142
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,440
[laughs]

1143
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,160
BLACK PEPPA: Fleur is doing
incredible on the runway.

1144
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,760
She is giving.

1145
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,160
This bitch is walking in the heels

1146
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,760
like she been walking in heels
every single day.

1147
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,000
MICHELLE: Yeah.
GRAHAM: Oh, there you go.

1148
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,360
That got in easy.

1149
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,520
BLACK PEPPA:
I'm so happy.

1150
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,960
I couldn't be more proud of her.

1151
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,360
GRAHAM: Twinning is winning.

1152
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,840
MICHELLE: Dakota Schiffer
and Brigitte Schiffer.

1153
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,440
Well, aren't you peachy keen?

1154
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,080
DAKOTA: We are serving
mother-daughter apricot realness

1155
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,400
in our gorgeous peach duchess satin gowns.

1156
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,680
And Lucie's giving you the more youthful

1157
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,520
because she literally looks six
in what I put her in.

1158
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,720
What a lovely bunch of apricots.

1159
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,400
[laughs]

1160
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,320
DAKOTA: I know that Lucie
feels beautiful.

1161
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,760
I feel very proud
that I'm bringing home a triplet

1162
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,280
to the Schiffer dynasty.
[laughs]

1163
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,480
MICHELLE: The Schiffers
are doing it for whom?

1164
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,440
Themselves.

1165
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,440
GRAHAM: They're doing it
for peach other.

1166
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,080
MICHELLE: [laughs]

1167
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,400
Welcome, ladies.

1168
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,000
Don't you all look stunning?

1169
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,760
Now it's time for the judges' critiques.

1170
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,520
Up first, Jonbers Blonde and Nanu Noir.

1171
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,360
Now, this is Olivia before,

1172
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,360
and look at her now.

1173
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,080
Wow.

1174
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,320
GRAHAM: I like this.

1175
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,720
You did something elegant and simple.

1176
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,600
You were obviously really having fun.

1177
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:06,520
The problem I slightly have
is family resemblance.

1178
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,960
There's more of a sense
of kind of gal pals,

1179
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,680
possibly widow on the
formal night on a cruise...

1180
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,840
[laughter]

1181
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,360
Hoping to sit on the captain.

1182
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,880
[laughter]

1183
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,200
Black-and-white combination is
one of my absolute favorite things.

1184
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,000
What I really loved was the presentation.

1185
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,080
It was so well choreographed.

1186
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,360
You both broke through the wall
at the same time.

1187
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,160
And I think that, Jonbers,
your makeup looks amazing.

1188
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,640
- Thank you.
- I love it.

1189
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,160
- Thank you.
- I love you two.

1190
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,000
It's very, like, classic, like
an old black-and-white movie.

1191
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,600
But I love the fact
that you have a bigger train.

1192
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,640
You're like, "I'm having
the bigger train."

1193
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,120
[laughter]

1194
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,400
I'm gonna echo Raven here

1195
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,600
and say you have come so far
with your makeup skills.

1196
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,440
You look beautiful.

1197
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,360
Your sister, her makeup is good.

1198
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,640
It's struggling a little bit,

1199
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,680
but I thought you did a really good job.

1200
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,280
And it looks like
you blocked her eyebrows.

1201
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,200
I did, yeah.

1202
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,600
Yeah, you're a proper drag queen today.

1203
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,400
Yeah, I wanted to give Olivia
the full experience,

1204
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,840
so she's tucked too.

1205
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,680
[laughter]

1206
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,640
Good job.
[laughter]

1207
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,680
Nanu, so you work here.

1208
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,000
What was it like being on the
stage versus from the sideline?

1209
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,600
- Yeah, terrifying.
- [laughs]

1210
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,400
I was so nervous.
I was absolutely petrified.

1211
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,560
But Jonbers calmed me from the get-go,

1212
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,320
and I loved every second of it.

1213
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,520
- Thank you, ladies.
- Thank you.

1214
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:26,240
Up next, Pixie Polite and Trixie Truelove.

1215
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,080
Now, this is Wendy before,

1216
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,920
and look at her now.

1217
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,800
[laughter]

1218
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,320
- Trixie, I truly love you.
- [laughs]

1219
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,000
You're just adorable.

1220
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,680
I get the family resemblance.

1221
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,840
You're just my favorite fairy,

1222
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,680
and there's been a lot of them.

1223
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,360
[laughs]

1224
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,360
Yeah, and I thought the humor
really came across,

1225
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,400
and that made me really happy
and made me smile.

1226
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,800
It's gorgeous.

1227
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,840
I totally enjoyed watching you both.

1228
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,680
You looked like you were having fun.

1229
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,760
The only thing is padding.

1230
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,240
Her hips, they do not lie.

1231
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,400
[laughter]

1232
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,040
I would say maybe two more pairs of tights

1233
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,960
just to kind of cover them up.
- Okay.

1234
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,080
Pixie, I thought that your relationship

1235
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,120
was abundantly clear.

1236
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,760
And I think the makeup on you
is so pretty,

1237
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,120
and I think you did your sister
just a little dirty there.

1238
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,160
Pixie, what was it like for you
working with Trixie?

1239
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,240
These lovely ladies really
have become, like, very close to us

1240
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,640
just because of how much
they look after us.

1241
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,080
And the outfits
were obviously fairy inspired,

1242
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,880
but they were also inspired
by a particular flower that used

1243
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,640
to grow in my nana's ga... sorry, hmm.

1244
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,960
Hmm. Come on.

1245
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,600
That used to grow in my nana's garden.

1246
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,280
And when I was growing up... sorry.

1247
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,720
I don't know why I'm so emotional.

1248
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,560
She's no longer with us,

1249
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,720
but she was a very huge part of my life

1250
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,120
for me as a young gay person.

1251
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,160
And going over to her house
and being in her garden,

1252
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,600
surrounded by all her gorgeous flowers,

1253
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,600
it felt like I was escaping
to my own little fairy world

1254
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,640
where I could sort of...

1255
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,000
Be who I needed to be.
Sorry.

1256
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,960
There's a lot of kids out there watching

1257
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,600
who could relate to that story,

1258
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,280
to have the ability that you had a Nana...

1259
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,680
- Yeah.
- That let you be

1260
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,440
and encouraged you to be who you are.

1261
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,680
And I was really glad to be
able to share it with Wendy...

1262
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,640
MICHELLE: Aw.

1263
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,400
Who's been my little mummy
while I've been here.

1264
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,680
Trixie, what was
this experience like for you?

1265
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,120
Well, I never thought I'd get to 60

1266
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,440
and end up being on a stage doing this.

1267
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,120
I think I look older with drag
than I do without.

1268
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,200
[laughter]
PIXIE: Oh, we know.

1269
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,400
We've got you in a bit of a purple rinse.

1270
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,000
I know. The purple rinse,
I think, is what's doing it.

1271
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,040
Mm.

1272
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,880
Until you actually have it done yourself,

1273
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,120
you don't realize
how much work goes into it.

1274
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,400
It was amazing.

1275
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,560
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1276
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:56,000
Up next, Danny Beard and Mizzy Moustache.

1277
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,920
Now, this is Mystique before,

1278
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,760
and look at her now!

1279
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,600
[laughter]

1280
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,280
Wow.

1281
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,560
This is so beautiful...

1282
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,200
The color palette, the style of it.

1283
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,160
Lovely family resemblance.
Congratulations.

1284
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,320
There was a time when, you know, the idea

1285
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,440
of having a beard
would've just been unthinkable,

1286
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,200
but I love your look.
It's so drag remix.

1287
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,680
It's breaking all the rules.
I love it.

1288
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,800
I love the whole, like, '60s vibe.

1289
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,800
The makeup looks great,

1290
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,120
that Danny Beard hard-carved cheek.

1291
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,040
It's great.
I love all of it.

1292
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:30,960
Thank you.

1293
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,360
Quintessentially Danny Beard.

1294
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,400
All the details are tended to here,

1295
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,080
but it's also fashion,

1296
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,160
and that's what it's about at this point.

1297
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,600
So I thought it was really, really fun.

1298
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,520
Do you feel beautiful, my love?

1299
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,400
I do.
I feel amazing.

1300
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,120
I was apprehensive about
the beard and the moustache.

1301
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,080
Said, "Wait till you've done
all the makeup."

1302
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,120
Of course, it all made sense.

1303
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,840
He wanted me to have
a good experience as well.

1304
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,440
- And did you?
- Yeah.

1305
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,640
Well done, babe.

1306
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,960
I'm just so proud that she feels great,

1307
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,760
'cause I know she was worried

1308
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,520
that I was gonna make her look silly.

1309
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,440
Yeah.

1310
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,280
And I wanted her to have a good time.

1311
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,680
I wanted her to come out here

1312
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,560
and feel the power that drag gives you.

1313
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,360
'Cause although I am gobby,
I wasn't always like that.

1314
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,280
And I found that power through drag,

1315
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,880
so she's got the power.

1316
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,000
[singing] I got the power.

1317
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,160
- Yes.
- Thank you guys.

1318
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,320
MICHELLE: Love that.
- So lovely.

1319
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,520
Thank you so much.

1320
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:33,160
Up next, Cheddar Gorgeous
and Brie Gorgeous.

1321
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,040
This is Gemma before,

1322
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,200
and wow, look at her now.

1323
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,320
[bell dings]
- Cheddar and Brie,

1324
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,520
when you came round the corner,

1325
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,800
it was just fabulous.

1326
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,640
You had that story line
of kind of, you know,

1327
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,760
you'd unleashed this terror on the world.

1328
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,360
You have stage presence,
and you clearly like it.

1329
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,800
[laughter]
So I think...

1330
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,440
overall, great job.

1331
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,160
- Are you cinched?
- Mm-hmm.

1332
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,320
- Yeah.
- Very.

1333
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,480
My organs are out of place, yeah.

1334
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,360
- As they should be.
- Yeah.

1335
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,920
I say leave them
in the workroom next time.

1336
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,760
[laughter]
Don't even bring them with you.

1337
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,600
It's beautiful.
- [mouthing words]

1338
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:13,280
It's so Blitz Club 1979.
Your look is on fire.

1339
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,360
Very Michele Clapton.

1340
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,920
She went on to design
for "Game of Thrones,"

1341
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,040
and she would worship this look.

1342
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,920
Royalty from the planet Gorgeous.

1343
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,400
The autumn colors.

1344
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,920
I almost get a sky in Brie's,

1345
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,320
and I get, like, the sunset in yours.

1346
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,840
It just all makes sense,
and it's just rich.

1347
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,480
Brie, what did you learn from Cheddar?

1348
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,360
Watching Cheddar just work
has just been incredible.

1349
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,920
It was so special to be able
to put these amazing women

1350
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,840
up onstage.
- Aw.

1351
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,000
'Cause you are wonderful.
All of you are wonderful.

1352
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,640
You're all right too.
[laughter]

1353
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,320
I've created a monster, haven't I?

1354
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,680
There we go.
- Thank you, ladies.

1355
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,920
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Good job.

1356
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,280
Up next, Black Peppa and Chilli Peppa.

1357
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,960
This is Fleur before,

1358
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,920
and look at Fleur now.

1359
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,240
I love this concept.

1360
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,560
I think it's really clever and fun.

1361
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,360
But just from the next down,
I sort of wished

1362
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,760
there'd been just another detail,

1363
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,720
just something else going on.

1364
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,280
Graham's right in the sense
that there's this amazing top,

1365
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,800
and then it's almost like the
bottom half, you've forgotten about.

1366
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,360
More is always a good option.

1367
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,720
I think that the makeup job you did,

1368
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,520
Black Peppa, is beautiful.

1369
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,320
Black Peppa, Chilli Peppa,
it's your girl White Salt.

1370
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,040
Hey, girl.
[laughter]

1371
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,400
I love the armor-ness of this dress.

1372
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,320
It's got details on it.

1373
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,080
The problem is, they're hard to see.

1374
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,240
It just needed to pop against
all the other things, that's all.

1375
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,040
Black Peppa, what was your
favorite part of this challenge?

1376
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,160
Working with Fleur.

1377
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,160
I was just like,

1378
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,480
couldn't have been a better
match made in heaven.

1379
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,720
And then the links of the hair.

1380
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,320
I don't really get along with my family,

1381
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:58,440
and when I connect... disconnected it...

1382
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,480
[sighs]

1383
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,800
It was me coming to UK,

1384
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,480
but no matter how far I am,
they will always be with me.

1385
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,720
MICHELLE: So you disconnected,

1386
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,960
and you reconnected
with your new chosen family.

1387
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,440
The family that I've made here,

1388
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,000
I am so thankful for them.

1389
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,240
MICHELLE: Feel the love, baby.

1390
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,040
You are loved, and you are welcome.

1391
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,040
Up next, Dakota Schiffer
and Brigitte Schiffer.

1392
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,080
This is Lucie before,

1393
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,800
and this is her now.

1394
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,680
You did the brief.

1395
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,520
It's a makeover, and there's
a family resemblance there.

1396
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,440
I'm not sure
about the checkered flag thing

1397
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,920
and quite how that fits into it.

1398
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,520
- Dakota, I'm gonna say bravo.
- Thank you.

1399
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,520
And looking at Brigitte's makeup,

1400
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,440
I see that very graphic

1401
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,160
1960s total vibe on her face.

1402
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,440
I love it.

1403
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,800
Reminds me
of "Ready, Steady, Go!"

1404
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,480
You know, bride of Elvis.

1405
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,360
So beautiful.

1406
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:03,120
- Thank you.
- I love the peach.

1407
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,960
I think my issue is, Dakota,
I'm gonna push you again.

1408
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,360
You are beautiful.

1409
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,200
[mouthing words]
MICHELLE: You are talented,

1410
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,960
but you could also do more
than you're giving me.

1411
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,560
Yeah. Okay.
MICHELLE: I know you can.

1412
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,400
Because I feel like every time,
it's the same silhouette.

1413
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,200
You're dreamy.
- [laughs]

1414
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,600
I just want more.
Could you blame me?

1415
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,600
Yeah.
[laughs]

1416
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,800
No, I can't blame you, Michelle.
MICHELLE: Exactly.

1417
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,960
Brigitte.
- Hi.

1418
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,920
How was this process for you, my darling?

1419
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,160
I was really nervous beforehand,

1420
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,000
but my nerves kind of melted away

1421
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,040
as soon as I was paired
with Dakota, really,

1422
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,480
'cause she's incred.

1423
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,680
Thank you.

1424
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,840
So just go.

1425
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,560
Thank you, queens.

1426
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,600
I think we've heard enough.

1427
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,480
And to our incredible Queen Team,

1428
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,800
for your extraordinary efforts
this week and every week,

1429
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,560
we are awarding each of you

1430
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,840
a coveted Ru Peter badge.

1431
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,360
- Yay!
- Yay!

1432
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,200
CHOIR: [singing] Rule, Britannia

1433
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,640
[bell dings]

1434
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,000
MICHELLE: Wear it with pride.

1435
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,880
While you untuck in the workroom,

1436
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,680
the judges and I will deliberate.

1437
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,600
You may leave the stage.

1438
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,400
PIXIE: Thank you all.
MYSTIQUE: Thank you.

1439
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,400
[mouths word]

1440
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,320
- Whoo!
- Oh, my God.

1441
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,520
Drink.

1442
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,360
It's like the early days
when this room was full.

1443
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:29,640
We are back and untucked,
and I feel amazing.

1444
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,000
- I can't move.
- Welcome to our world.

1445
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,560
Welcome to our world.
- [laughs]

1446
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,600
There's very few things that
I feel really comfortable doing,

1447
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,240
but making somebody over?

1448
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,840
I'm good with it.
I love it.

1449
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,360
I think everyone deserves
a round of applause.

1450
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,520
- Yeah.
- Yes. Cheers, everyone.

1451
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,960
- Cheers.
- To the Queen Team.

1452
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,840
What a debut.

1453
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,480
I don't know what the hell's
going on tonight.

1454
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,320
It's so mixed.

1455
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:55,480
Mine, they said they didn't get
family resemblance,

1456
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,480
but what I don't understand is,

1457
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,760
there's other people up there
that have the same color, like,

1458
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,600
same color palette but in different ways.

1459
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,800
It's kind of what I've done.

1460
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,000
I had the same sort of makeup
sort of every time.

1461
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,640
I'm really inspired by old Hollywood.

1462
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,760
Looks a bit more like
Paul Hollywood, though, love.

1463
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,360
[laughter]

1464
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,120
Says "Fraggle Rock" over here.

1465
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:20,640
Ooh.
[laughter]

1466
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,040
Well, the thing I'd say about that is,

1467
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,800
I don't know what this outfit
or look says about you.

1468
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,760
I can see from lot of the
others, like, what their drag is.

1469
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,520
There is no specific one look for me

1470
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,920
because I change my look
every single time I do drag.

1471
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,960
We all change our looks all the time...

1472
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,120
No, I know, but I didn't want...

1473
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,520
But I feel like a lot of us have something

1474
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,640
in our look that is still very us.

1475
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,960
I agree with the judges.

1476
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,440
I didn't understand...

1477
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,280
Why they were dressed like mimes,

1478
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:56,160
and I didn't see
that they were related at all.

1479
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,280
Like you, I do different looks
all of the time,

1480
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,240
and each runway I've done,
like, something different,

1481
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,360
but there are things that I know

1482
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,920
that people find as being my signature.

1483
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,760
Cheddar, if you think that gold leaf

1484
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,960
is what makes your drag,

1485
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,960
that's lovely to think that, darling.

1486
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,800
But don't come for my drag.

1487
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,360
I'm not here to be judged by other queens.

1488
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,680
I'm here to be judged by the judges.

1489
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,360
This, you can tell this is a Cheddar look.

1490
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,480
You can tell this is a Danny look.

1491
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,200
You can tell this is a Danny look.

1492
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,360
No offense.

1493
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,360
[laughter]

1494
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,240
[slurps]

1495
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,240
I think that was kind of, like,

1496
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,880
the opposite of my critique.

1497
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,280
I think I was so concerned
in the first week

1498
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,800
that they hadn't got my aesthetic

1499
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,200
that every single week,
I kind of up until now

1500
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,600
have been like,
"'Valley of the Dolls, ' '60s.

1501
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,040
Like, please get it."
And now they're like,

1502
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,960
"We get it.
Jesus, Dakota, like"...

1503
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,280
[laughter]

1504
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,040
LUCIE: I love being
Schiffer-ized.

1505
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,800
- [laughs]
- Honestly, every single thing

1506
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,840
about your aesthetic, I appreciate.

1507
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,160
But you've actually made me live

1508
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,000
my blonde, freckled fantasy...
- Yes.

1509
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,320
Which I've always wanted to do,

1510
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,240
so thank you.

1511
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,280
DAKOTA:
There's definitely a chance

1512
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,640
I could be in the bottom,
and it would be so crushing

1513
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,480
to go home now, but I'm just
so proud of the work we did,

1514
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,960
and I'm just so proud of Lucie.

1515
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,000
- Pixie, babe, how are you feeling?
- I feel okay.

1516
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,280
I mean, if I'm in the bottom,
it is what it is.

1517
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,640
- Yeah.
- I'm happy.

1518
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,720
I've given Wendy her fairy fantasy

1519
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,160
that she's always wanted.

1520
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,360
Oh, Wendy's face. Honey.

1521
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,800
It's so funny.

1522
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,640
Wendy was like,
"I love fairies."

1523
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,800
And Pixie said, "Yeah, I'm gonna drag you

1524
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:35,960
through the mud, girl."

1525
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,560
She did Wendy so bad.
[laughs]

1526
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,720
I think I could very possibly
be lip-synching still, like...

1527
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,040
- It could be any of us, so...
- You know.

1528
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,040
Well, I don't think it's you,
Cheddar, and I don't think it's Danny.

1529
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,280
You've got the best.

1530
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,120
You know, if it comes to it,
you know, we'll spread a little bit

1531
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,800
of pixie dust on that stage
and one of you is going home.

1532
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,520
This has been my most favorite week

1533
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,680
since I've been here.
- Yeah, I've loved it.

1534
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,840
- Absolutely.
- Oh, yeah.

1535
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,800
It means the world, honestly.

1536
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,080
You've just been our family
since we've been here.

1537
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
- Well done, everyone.
- Well done, everyone.

1538
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,040
- Here's to everyone.
- To the Queen Team!

1539
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,080
Can I take the wig off?
[laughter]

1540
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,960
All right, now,
just between us girlfriends,

1541
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,080
what do you think,
starting with Jonbers Blonde?

1542
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:29,800
It was perfectly pleasant,
but it didn't make the impact

1543
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,800
that a lot of the other couples
made tonight.

1544
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,920
They didn't push it enough.

1545
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,560
They were sisters
from other misters, whatever.

1546
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,040
But she gave them both very chic looks.

1547
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,080
I don't think it was that bad.

1548
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,280
I like that they had fun,
they had choreography,

1549
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:44,040
they had a thing on the stage,

1550
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:48,040
but family resemblance,
it has to be obvious.

1551
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,720
The black and white was
not enough to tie it together.

1552
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,920
Up next, Pixie Polite.

1553
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,720
I like Pixie.
They were adorable together.

1554
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,280
The outfits were a bit panto.

1555
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:03,400
Beautiful, lovely,
but rough around the edges.

1556
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,800
I mean, those pads,

1557
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,760
they were like lumpy mashed potatoes.

1558
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,080
I do think she looked beautiful tonight.

1559
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,640
However, Trixie looked like pow, pow, pow.

1560
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,920
She took her out.

1561
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,320
The best thing ever is hearing someone say

1562
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,760
their makeup makes them look older.

1563
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,520
[laughter]
- I know.

1564
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,200
You don't ever want to hear
one of our guests say

1565
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,720
they feel like they look older in drag.

1566
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,240
Thanks.
[laughter]

1567
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,480
MICHELLE: Okay, up next,
Danny Beard.

1568
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:29,160
I thought it was really
elevated, fashion, stylish.

1569
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,200
There was a great family resemblance.

1570
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,480
I love Danny Beard's take on drag

1571
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:38,440
because it is this hyper-feminized shape,

1572
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,800
and there's a beard.

1573
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,040
I mean, imagine the first time
you ever get to be in drag,

1574
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,280
you've got to wear a beard.
- [laughs]

1575
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,280
BOY GEORGE:
Yeah, I loved it,

1576
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:49,680
laughing in the face of kind of
traditional kind of drag.

1577
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:50,760
Oh, my goodness.

1578
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,520
I loved everything about this look...

1579
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,480
The different color beards, hair, purses.

1580
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,680
I thought it was a strong night
for Danny Beard.

1581
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,640
Up next, Cheddar Gorgeous.

1582
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,320
This was out of this world.
I mean, literally.

1583
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,400
They were like a kind of
constellation or something.

1584
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,120
It was really beautiful.

1585
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,640
The metallic-ness of the makeup

1586
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,880
with the leafing... just those
little, subtle details

1587
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,480
that are something that I love.

1588
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,600
I thought it was just beautiful.

1589
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,600
Like, it was... they were oozing
on the stage together,

1590
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,320
and they just looked symbiotic.

1591
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,560
It was a home run.

1592
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,560
Up next, Black Peppa.

1593
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:27,800
I have to admit,
I was slightly disappointed.

1594
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:31,320
And I guess we've come to expect
such wonderful outfits

1595
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,560
from Black Peppa that in this challenge,

1596
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,800
for it to suddenly to be, essentially,

1597
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,920
a little black dress
seemed kind of underwhelming.

1598
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,640
I love what she did from the neck up.

1599
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,800
We all know about those
evenings when you've spent so long

1600
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,320
on the face, you know,
you forgot what you're wearing.

1601
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,480
It did kind of look like
she ripped the head off

1602
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,840
of one Barbie
and then stuck it on another...

1603
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,320
[laughter]
And was like,

1604
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,320
"Okay, we're going
onto the main stage."

1605
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:58,720
I think that hair and
that story was so powerful

1606
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,560
but also agree with Graham.

1607
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,760
At this point in the competition,

1608
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,800
not quite enough.

1609
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,480
Up next, Dakota Schiffer.

1610
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:10,520
Checkered tights and gloves with peach.

1611
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,040
I love mixing things up
and making it go kind of,

1612
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,480
"Oh, wow, I would've never
thought of that."

1613
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,560
But I literally would have never
thought of this.

1614
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,880
[laughter]

1615
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,040
Dakota likes to do a very beautiful makeup

1616
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,120
that is suitable for going
to a nice dinner.

1617
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,160
[laughs]

1618
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,920
I still feel like she could
take it a little further.

1619
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,280
Not the best night for Dakota,

1620
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,920
but I thought a wonderful night
for Brigitte.

1621
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,360
I love that Lucie got to do this.

1622
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:39,400
I love that she felt so fabulous
and looked so fabulous.

1623
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,280
I think what upsets me
is that we saw this look.

1624
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,760
She just did "Funny Girl."

1625
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,800
I'm not trying to change
the way she does drag.

1626
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,880
Give us something different,
because predictability

1627
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,680
is not a good word here on the main stage

1628
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,080
of "RuPaul's Drag Race,"

1629
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,680
and that's where we are
with Dakota right now.

1630
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,280
All right, silence.

1631
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,120
I have not made my decision.

1632
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,400
I need to call RuPaul.

1633
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,920
Welcome back, ladies.

1634
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,880
Oh, no.
But nobody can go, honestly.

1635
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,680
Pixie Polite,

1636
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:17,120
your garden fairies were beautiful,

1637
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:20,840
but some of the details
got a little muddy.

1638
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,640
I'm sorry, my dear,

1639
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,720
but you are up for elimination.

1640
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,200
- [gasps]
- Wow.

1641
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,680
- No. Wendy.
- My God.

1642
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:34,280
Danny Beard,

1643
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,560
you and your sister were groovy, baby.

1644
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,680
Cheddar Gorgeous,

1645
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,520
you and your sister
were out of this world.

1646
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,160
Cheddar Gorgeous, condragulations,

1647
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,880
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.

1648
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,240
[all cheering]
- Oh, Gemma.

1649
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,360
Babe.

1650
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,840
You've earned a coveted Ru Peter badge.

1651
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:03,960
[mouthing words]

1652
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,360
CHOIR: [singing] Rule, Britannia.

1653
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,800
I would offer to give it
to the Queen Team,

1654
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,120
but you already gave them one,
so I guess I'll just keep it.

1655
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,720
Danny Beard, you are safe.

1656
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,360
Thank you, judges.

1657
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,520
Ladies, you may step
to the back of the stage.

1658
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,600
Black Peppa...

1659
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,560
you're safe.

1660
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,640
You may join the other girls.

1661
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,080
Thank you so much.

1662
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:36,120
Oh, my God.
[sighs]

1663
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,360
Jonbers Blonde,

1664
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:43,120
your fashion game was spot-on,

1665
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:47,320
but your family resemblance
was a little off.

1666
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:51,560
Dakota Schiffer,

1667
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,720
you and your sister were fabu...

1668
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,440
But your makeup and hair
were a little déjà vu.

1669
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,360
Dakota Schiffer,

1670
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,160
I'm sorry, my dear,

1671
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,680
but you are up for elimination.

1672
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,040
DAKOTA: This is the third
lip sync I've been in,

1673
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,360
but, you know, I am still fighting,

1674
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,280
and I really don't want to go home.

1675
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:21,760
Oh, hey.
Luce, don't cry.

1676
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,480
Jonbers, you're safe.

1677
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,160
Thank you so much.

1678
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,880
You may join the other girls.

1679
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,360
Two queens stand before me.

1680
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,760
Prior to tonight,
you were asked to prepare

1681
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,720
a lip sync performance

1682
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:48,880
of "Miss Me Blind" by Culture Club.

1683
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,760
[clicks tongue]

1684
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:55,760
Ladies, this is
your last chance to impress us

1685
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:59,600
and save yourself from elimination.

1686
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:05,120
The time has come...
[thunder booming]

1687
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:08,880
For you to lip-synch

1688
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,440
for your life.

1689
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,040
PIXIE:
I love Dakota like a daughter,

1690
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,440
but sometimes you've
just got to leave that baby

1691
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,480
on the step of the church.

1692
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,560
Good luck.

1693
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,400
And, Boy George...

1694
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,560
Don't fuck it up.

1695
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:31,760
CULTURE CLUB: [singing]
Miss me

1696
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,560
I know you'll miss me

1697
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:37,440
I know you'll miss me blind

1698
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,760
I know you'll miss me

1699
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,680
I know you'll miss me

1700
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,800
I know you'll miss me blind

1701
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,520
I know you'll miss me

1702
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,520
I know you'll miss me

1703
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,000
I know you'll miss me blind.

1704
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Bet you got a good gun.

1705
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,920
Bet you know how.

1706
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:00,880
To have some fun and then.

1707
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:04,760
You turn it around on me because

1708
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:08,320
I'm better than the rest of the men

1709
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:12,840
I say you'll miss me.

1710
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:16,080
And you always do

1711
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:20,760
I say you'll miss me.

1712
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:24,200
Now, would I lie to you.

1713
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,120
Now, there's no need to demand.

1714
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,280
Grab my golden hand

1715
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:32,160
I'll teach you and you'll never be sure.

1716
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,040
If the way that you need.

1717
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,080
Is too much like greed.

1718
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,320
Decide if you are rich or you're poor.

1719
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:43,680
Because the love that I have to give.

1720
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:47,640
Must be better than that kind.

1721
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,600
It can make you rich.

1722
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,600
It can make you poor.

1723
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,000
But I know that you'll miss me blind

1724
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,160
I know you'll miss me

1725
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:00,640
I know you'll miss me.
- Come on, Dakota.

1726
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,680
CULTURE CLUB: [singing]
I know you'll miss me blind

01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,160
I know you'll miss me

- Amazing.
- No one go home.

1735
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:29,880
Let's talk to Ru.

1736
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:43,800
Ladies, Ru has made her decision.

1737
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,600
[dramatic music]

1738
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:53,240
Pixie Polite,

1739
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,640
shantay, you stay.

1740
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,720
PIXIE: [crying]

1741
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:00,360
- You may join the other girls.
- Thank you.

1742
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,400
PIXIE:
You're a superstar, okay?

1743
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,640
Dakota Schiffer, you fabulous woman, you.

1744
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,000
You put the super in supermodel.

1745
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:23,320
Now, sashay away.

1746
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:28,680
Thank you for the most
incredible experience

1747
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:33,080
and letting me finally
have confidence in myself.

1748
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,400
[sniffles]
Thank you.

1749
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:41,760
MICHELLE: Aw.
DAKOTA: [crying]

1750
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,360
You're amazing.
[crying]

1751
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,760
JONBERS: [crying]

1752
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,000
The doll has to leave the valley.

1753
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,480
[laughter]

1754
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,480
[cheers and applause]

1755
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,560
Wait. I've got an idea.
[laughs]

1756
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,920
To go out on this moment, like,
it's impossible to be sad.

1757
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,240
[groans]

1758
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,200
I'm so proud of myself.

1759
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,240
I've done things I've never thought

1760
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,520
I'd be able to do here.

1761
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:15,480
I was the first trans woman
on "Drag Race UK."

1762
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,520
To be that representation
has just been an honor

1763
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,400
to represent my community.

1764
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,760
- Dakota.
- Thank you so much.

1765
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,800
Oh, thank you.

1766
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,280
- I've had the best time.
- Oh, I'm so proud of you.

1767
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:29,480
Thank you.

1768
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,760
You are such an incredible queen,

1769
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:31,960
such an incredible woman.

1770
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:34,400
The world is not ready
for Dakota Schiffer.

1771
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,560
[laughs] But I have a new sister.

1772
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,280
Absolutely.
I will really miss you, babe.

1773
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:39,560
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1774
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,720
You're amazing.
- Thank you.

1775
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,080
MICHELLE:
Condragulations, queens.

1776
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,200
In the words of Mama Ru,

1777
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,200
if you can't love yourself,

1778
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,960
how the hell are you
gonna love somebody else?

1779
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,560
Can I get an amen up in hurr?

1780
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,160
ALL: Amen.

1781
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,680
Yes. Now, let the music play.

1782
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:02,960
RUPAUL: [singing]
To, to, to, to the moon.

1783
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,160
To the moon.

1784
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,440
To the moon.
- Gonna take me away.

1785
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,240
To, to, to, to the moon.

1786
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,040
To the moon, to the moon.

1787
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,240
Hello, hello, hello.

1788
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,480
Next time on "RuPaul's Drag Race UK"...

1789
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,560
[laughs]
- She's back.

1790
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,280
You'll be acting in a murder mystery

1791
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,040
with a modern twist.

1792
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,960
The Squirrel Games.
- Action.

1793
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,360
Oh, I'm gonna shove this

1794
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,840
where the sun don't shine, my dear.

1795
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,000
Oh!

1796
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,760
I've got a bit of Tess Daly,
a bit of Cilla.

1797
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,280
- Are you a high-vis amoeba?
- [laughs]

1798
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,080
Are you a neon scourer?

1799
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,240
Not coming for you, though.

1800
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,160
It felt a very pointed comment.

1801
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,840
They're all a bunch of snakes.
