00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,120
- Hello. Hello. Hello.

2
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,320
Previously on "RuPaul's Drag
Race UK"...

3
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,920
You'll be acting in a murder
mystery

4
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,320
with a modern twist, The
Squirrel Games.

5
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,560
- Let The Squirrel Games begin.

6
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,760
- Don't scream too loud.

7
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,960
- Pugly, Pugly's seen it all.

8
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,720
- Its fugly.

9
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,080
- [clears throat]

10
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,560
- Jonbers Blonde,
your performance,

11
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,720
it was all pedal to the metal.

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,040
Black Peppa.

13
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,800
- I liked where you were going,

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,360
but I was trying to help you
not scream so much.

15
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,000
- Cheddar Gorgeous,
you were so funny in this thing.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Condragulations.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,920
You're the winner
of this week's challenge.

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,520
[applause]

19
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,240
Black Peppa.

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,600
Shantay, you stay.

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,480
Jonbers Blonde.

22
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,520
Shantay, you also stay.

23
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,440
[cheers and applause]

24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,000
- Oh, you got me, girl.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,760
- Yeah, I got you, girl.

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,840
[upbeat music]

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,600

[laughter]

29
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,520
- We're back in the work room.

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,280
Ru has just saved Peppa and me.

31
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,520
- There's no lipstick message
to read.

32
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,360
- I know.

33
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,720
- And I am delighted.

34
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,920
- Well done, girls.

35
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,720
- My God.
- My God.

36
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,160
- You put on a show.

37
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,280
- Mm. How did that feel?

38
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,680
- It felt good.
JONBERS: Yeah.

39
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,520
You're fighting for your life.

40
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,160
But at the same time,
you have to enjoy it,

41
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,040
because if you're not
up there enjoying yourself,

42
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,720
then it's time to go home.

43
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,040
- And do you know what?

44
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,920
That was Peppa's third lip sync.

45
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,800
And she survived.

46
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,640
And people don't often do that.

47
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,680
- No. Yeah. Well done, you.
PIXIE: So like...

48
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,200
the official lip sync assassin
of the season.

49
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,320
PEPPA: Week after week,
I fought, and I stayed.

50
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,200
I'm just so proud of myself.

51
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,640
How are you feeling, Danny?

52
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,560
- I'm a bit gutted because
I've come, like, second, I
suppose,

53
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,080
in the last term.

54
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,440
And I do think out of the two
ruffles,
mine is a nicer look.

55
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,800
No tea, no shade.

56
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,800
- They weren't mad about my
big--
whatever they called it.

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,880
- No, Ru said some really fab
things
about it, babe.

58
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,440
- I don't want to sound like
a Bitter Betty, because I ain't.

59
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,400
But I was serving blue waffle
realness with a slice of fem.

60
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,960
She looked like a rotten
cabbage.

61
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,040
- Well, there's one more
challenge.

62
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,400
And then it's the final.

63
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,480
- Oh, my God.

64
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,560
PIXIE: The end is near.

65
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,200
- The end is--no!
- Ah!

66
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,320
- [laughs]

67
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,240
- What's next?

68
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,480
- Who knows?

69
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,960
I am a four-badge bitch.

70
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
PIXIE: Cheds, can you taste the
crown?

71
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,760
Is it cheesy?

72
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,120
- I'm not gonna get complacent.

73
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,280
I'm gonna keep on working hard.

74
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,040
- You do you, girl.

75
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,120
CHEDDAR: I get it.

76
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,640
I want to win now.

77
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,160
- The crown is almost there,
okay?

78
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,480
It's anybody's game still.
I could still win this.

79
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,560
If anyone's ever in doubt, I'll
just--

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,440
DANNY: At this stage in the
competition,

82
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,640
if you're not in the top,
you're in the bottom.

83
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,800
[tin whistle piping]

84
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,360
So I need to be in the top

85
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,000
because I want to be in that
final.

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,520
- Can you do the Drag Race
theme tune on that?

87
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,080
[tin whistle piping]

88
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,960
No.

It's the semi-final.

We're sausage rolling into the
finale.

And we're still a top five.

Well, ladies, here we are, top
five again.

Oh, my God, you beat me to it.

- Oh, rats.

113
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,760
- And congrats on four badges,
Cheddar.
- Ah!

114

- Four badges!

115

- I do feel like there's
a gigantic target on my back
now,

116
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,080
but that's okay.

117
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,400
I think me having so many badges

118
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,840
will make the girls see me
in a particular light.

119
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,560
I just don't know what that
light is.

120
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,920
I'm sleeping with both eyes
open,

121
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,400
but that doesn't make any
difference

122
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
to how I normally sleep.

Because we've had Rusical.

We've had the girl group.

We've now had acting.

What's next?

129
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,760
Are they gonna combine it all?

130
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,800

DANNY: Ooh, yes.

138

- Are you facing
yet another probe?

139
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,000
Sounds like you may be suffering

because I think,

148
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,280
once again, it's a comedy
challenge.

149

So for this week's maxi

- #DragRaceUK.

166
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,400
And later, to help you put
your funny where your mouth is,

167
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,200
you'll meet with BAFTA-winning
comedian
Aisling Bea.

168
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,080
[cheers and applause]
- Ooh, like a little Irish.

169
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,360
- Aisling Bea, Irish goddess.

170
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,560
I'm so excited, I could shit.

171
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,240
- And tomorrow on the main
stage,

172
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,200
we'll be joined
by our extra special guest
judge,

173
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,880
Olly Alexander.

174
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,080
[cheers and applause]

175
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,080
- I've got such a crush
on Olly Alexander.

176
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,640
Don't tell my boyfriend.

177
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,880
[laughs]

178
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,840
- Now, Black Peppa
and Jonbers Blonde,

179
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,960
since you both survived
last week's lip sync,

180
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,440
you get to work together

181
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,880
to assign the order of
appearance.

182
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,440
- No!

183
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,720
- Wow.
- Ah!

184
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,120
- Bird lady rising.

185
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,520
- Oh, and one more thing.

186
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,080
To make this roast extra juicy,

187
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,520
I've invited the eliminated
season four queens to join us.

188
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,440
[cheers and applause]

189
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,480
DANNY: Yes!

190
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,560
- Racers, start your engines.

191
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,160
And may the best drag queen win.

192
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,080
- Whoo!

193
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,960
- Jonbers and I are given the
role

194
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,600
to assign the order of the
roast.

195
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,920
- I've got to try and be funny.

196
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,360
I need a lot of time.

197
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,320
- Remember who your friends are,
bitches.

198
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,000
- I know this is not
one of my strong suits,

199
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,880
so this is a really good
advantage

200
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,040
to put myself in a position
where I do not

201
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,000
have someone that's super funny
before me,

202
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,040
then I look like shit.

203
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,600
- Where do you want to be?

204
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,000
- I do not want to go first or
last.
- Yeah.

205
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,680
- I think being sandwiched
in the middle kind of helps,

206
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,520
so if someone's really good,
then at least,

207
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,320
it doesn't throw you off.

208
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,200
- Mm-hmm.

209
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,560
- Peppa and Jonbers
are picking the order.

210
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,680
- Don't worry.

211
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,040
- It doesn't worry me.

212
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,400
I'll be funny wherever I go.

213
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
I love a good roast.

214
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,040
I won the reading challenge, so
hoping

215
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,520
that I can do well this week.

216
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,120
- We want to end, obviously,
well,

217
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,880
but we don't want to end on a
super high.

218
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,680
I don't think we end on Pixie

219
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,840
'cause Pixie is really
confident.

220
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,360
I don't think she should be
either--

221
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,560
like, I don't know.

222
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,960
I don't know.

223
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,960
- If I was in their position, I
would--

224
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,080
- I know they can hear it.

225
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

226
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,080
- You look gorgeous today.

227
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,280
- Oh. Thank you.

228
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,240
- Do you know who my favorite is
out of you two?

229
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
- Herself.

230
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,320
[laughter]

231
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,760
- The roast has begun.

232
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,440
- I'm feeling a little bit
intimidated
by this challenge.

233
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,280
I have certainly told jokes on
stage.

234
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,640
I have also been laughed at.

235
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,240
Never the twain have met.

236
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,760
JONBERS: What would you do?

237
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,760
I'm listening.

238
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,560
- I would like to go earlier.

239
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,120
I think I'm gonna be very much

240
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,720
leaning into the political
character
side of things.

241
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,920
- She wants first place.

242
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,680
- Probably not the big jokey
bits,
you know?

243
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,520
I am not a rip roaring comic.

244
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,200
And so I wouldn't mind being,
like, in the middle

245
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,480
or going earlier.

246
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,200
- We can go in the order of,
like,

247
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
how many badges we've got.

248
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,800
So, Jonbers, you can go first
because you've got none.

249
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,640
[laughter]

250
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,320
- Wow. You're really working
on getting her on your side,

251
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,000
aren't you?
- Seriously.

252
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,720
DANNY: I am happy as long
as I'm not after Pixie

253
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,360
because I think she is gonna
slay it.

254
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,160
And that will put the willies on
me.

255
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,560
And I don't want the willies on
me
right now.

256
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,880
- I'm happy with that.
- Yeah.

257
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,280
It starts off big.

258
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,560
Big mouth Danny.

259
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,840
- Hurry up.

260
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,480
- It actually is really tough.

261
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,160
But like--I mean, like, we
honestly

262
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,320
really didn't want to be
strategic
in a way at all.

263
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,240
We obviously just want
to make sure we're safe

264
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,160
because, like, you're two funny
bitches
and Cheddar.

265
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,640
[laughter]

266
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,880
- That was good.

267
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,160
- Okay, up first, Danny Beard.

268
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,040
Second is me.

269
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,880
- Okay.
- Third will be Peppa.

270
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,920
Fourth is Pixie.

271
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,080
And fifth is Cheddar.

272
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,520
- You put the dry, unfunny one
at the end?

273
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,600
[dramatic music]

274
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,320
- No matter where
anybody puts it--

275
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,520
- Someone would have had a
problem.

276
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,640
JONBERS: It's five people.

277
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,440
And no way was this done
in a vindictive way at all.

278
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,760
- What's funny is
that I just said to you

279
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,680
I'd like to go earlier.

280
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,760
And you literally put me at the
end.

281
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,640
- There has to be an order.

282
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,720
- It's fine.

283
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,240
- You have a strong
political message.

284
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,160
And to end on a high--

285
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,240
- It's fine.

286
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,640
- It wasn't strategic
or anything like that.

287
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,360
- It's fine.

288
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,920
DANNY: When people say they're
fine,

289
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,880
it means they're feeling
insecure, needy, and emotional.

290
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,160
CHEDDAR: I just maybe just know
my own humor.

291
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,440
I'm very dry.

292
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,280
And so I think you'll be going
out
on a kind of--a very--

293
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,800
on a note that's like that.

294
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
You know what I mean?

295
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,400
Because I'm a very dry person.

296
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,720
- We were just trying
to make an order

297
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,840
at the end of the day.

298
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,280
So like, I understand how you
feel,

299
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,320
but you have four badges
on your head right now.

300
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
- Cool.

301
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,080
- And as we said, it's not
strategic.

302
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,960
And if you feel that way,
babe, honestly, it's you.

303
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,520
- Ooh, it's a bit awkward, isn't
it?

304
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,360
Now it feels rather tense,
doesn't it, ladies?

305
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,600
I don't think they threw anyone
under the bus necessarily,

306
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,320
but it feels like maybe
they were being tactical

307
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
with the order of the roast.

308
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,240
- Jonbers Blonde,
how's that argument made you
feel?

309
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,080
- [laughs, chomps]

310
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,200
Hungry.

311
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,680
CHEDDAR: I'm annoyed.

312
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,360
I just think I've got to get on
with it,

313
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,400
push forward, keep going.

314
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,520
I mean, they still think
they put me in the wrong place,

315
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,800
but--

316
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,920
[laughs]

317
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
- Now it's time
for some comedy coaching

318
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,640
with legend Aisling Bea.

319
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,160
It's about to get very Irish in
here.

320
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,840
- Jonbers, how 'bout you?

321
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,880
- What about you, love?

322
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,600
- How 'bout you now, Jonbers?

323
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,000
- Oh, it's nice to see
another Irish girl in the house.

324
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,080
- Oh, my God.

325
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,840
Delighted by you.

326
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,160
Whoo!

327
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,840
- Hi.
- Cheddar Gorgeous.

328
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,800
Oh, my God.

329
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,160
My favorite food and a beautiful
person.

330
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
- Well, there we go.

331
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,440
- How are you?
- I'm good.

332
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,720
You're from Liverpool?

333
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,920
- What gave that away, the
stolen clothes?

334
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,600
- Yeah. Yeah.
[laughter]

335
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,280
Are you used to doing
kind of talking to people and
stand up?

336
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,720
You're not? So you're not used
to this?
- No.

337
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,280
The closest thing I've done to a
roast

338
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,000
is the reading challenge, and
that bombed.

339
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,360
- I have died on my arse
on more stages

340
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,520
than I've succeeded.

341
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,000
So like, you can't do worse
than I've already done.

342
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,720
- I'll be honest, right?

343
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,680
Writing stuff down terrifies me.

344
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,360
- I, myself, have never
written a stand-up joke down.

345
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,520
I write a bullet point, and I
remember

346
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,440
what I'm saying to not lose that
element

347
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,800
of walking around.

348
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,720
And if you see something, say
it.

349
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,520
But always have a bullet point
to come

350
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,480
back to just so if you're
nervous

351
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,400
and it's--and it's tight.

352
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Whoops. As we all know.

353
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,760
- Always tight, darling.

354
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,720
Trust me.

355
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,080
- I wish I could say the same
for me.

356
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,960
I've had a long life, Danny.

357
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,440
Do you want to give it a go?

358
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,200
- My pal Copper Topp is here.

359
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,880
I'll never forget the first time
we met,

360
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,160
but I will keep trying.

361
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,480
[laughter]

362
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,280
Alan, I just love your smile.

363
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,800
And looking at your teeth,
it just looks like your tongue's

364
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,800
on a day trip to Stonehenge.

365
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,200
- And I would say, as a drag
queen,

366
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,560
I get to travel the country.

367
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,760
And what's so nice is to be able
to have Stonehenge here.

368
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
Oh, no. Sorry, Alan.

369
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,720
That's your teeth.
[laughter]

370
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,600
Something like that.

371
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
- Is that not a bit mean?

372
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,240
- That's not a bit mean.

373
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,120
Don't ever question yourself
in your delivery.

374
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,200
- Just be confident in the joke.

375
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
- Yeah. Exactly.

376
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,440
These are solid gags.

377
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,280
- Thank you.

378
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,040
It's my last chance to get a
badge.

379
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,040
I think I've got a good chance
to get a badge.

380
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,120
- It's gonna be brilliant.

381
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,200
This is easy territory.

382
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,360
- Thank you so much.

383
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,640
You've been--you've been lovely.

384
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,200
I just hope I can pull it off.

385
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,600
- Welcome to my political roast

386
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,880
where I slaughter my candidates'
image

387
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,720
to make myself look good.

388
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,880
- Wait. Say that again?

389
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,680
- Where I slaughter
my candidates

390
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,560
or my political opposition

391
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,680
to make myself look good.

392
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,400
- Your voice is quite quiet.

393
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,200
Imagine there's someone
at the back of the room

394
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,600
and you're trying to get them.

395
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,720
Really project.
- Okay.

396
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,400
Let's start roasting these
bitches.

397
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,600
- See, even that, I didn't--
you mumbled it.

398
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,440
- Let's start roasting
these bitches.

399
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,960
- Yes. There it is.

400
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,160
Give it to me again now.

401
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,480
- Let's start roasting these
bitches.

402
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,840
- Yes. Oh.

403
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,680
Dramatically different.

404
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,520
PEPPA: I have great ideas in my
head.

405
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,800
I just don't know how to
translate it
through speech.

406
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,520
Copper Topp is living proof
that things do get better.

407
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,760
- Sell it more, I think.

408
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,600
- Okay.

409
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,080
And the next delegate, Copper
Topp,

410
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,840
living proof that things do get
better.

411
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,000
- Beautiful. Yes.

412
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,120
- Oh, good.
- Lovely.

413
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,680
- I'm actually feeling good
already.

414
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,120
- Yeah.
- I got this.

415
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,280
- I feel like I've got a good
structure.

416
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,960
- Yes.
- I've got good character.

417
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
- Yeah.

418
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,560
- I actually think
what I lack is the jokes.

419
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,520
- Jokes. Right.

420
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,680
Well, let's work on that.

421
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,880
- My set has been inspired
by people in power

422
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,760
in our societies
actually being reptile people,

423
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,680
because it's the truth.

424
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,280
People of the planet Earth,
you may have heard terrible,

425
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,640
terrible rumors about me and my
kind,

426
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,520
that we wish to destroy your
institutions

427
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,240
and change your entire way of
life.

428
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,000
- So with that, it is a lovely
premise,
but it is a roast.

429
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,720
Never go too long
without putting in a little gag.

430
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,880
- I am so grateful to have this
session.

431
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,960
She is going to turn
this serious sexy dolphin

432
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,720
into a comedy genius.

433
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,800
Of course, the world--

434
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,720
- So there--

435
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,080
I would stop you there and go,

436
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,080
now we need a roast gag
about someone else.

437
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,920
- Okay.

438
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,280
- Don't deliver it like a play
though.

439
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,400
Deliver it to a live audience.

440
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,960
- Either the judges will go for
it or--

441
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,760
well, I'm learning to lip sync.

442
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,440
- I will bring in drag queens
across borders,

443
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,200
bringing Northern Irish Queens

444
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,800
to the mainland,
breaking barriers between boob
tubes

445
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,440
and paddle pushers.

446
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,520
- Yeah.

447
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,200
- Aisling is a boost to my
confidence.

448
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,080
She's making me feel right at
home
on the stage.

449
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,240
- Every time there's a little
moment,

450
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,240
if you could just do a poke at
someone,

451
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,840
that makes it all the more
roasty.
- Yeah.

452
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,000
- As you would
in a good dinner in Ireland,

453
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,560
put in a little roast here and
there.

454
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,480
- I'm gonna eat up all those
spuds.

455
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,640
- Yeah, do.
- Yeah.

456
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,880
- Who can forget Starlet?

457
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,520
The look's 50% of the mark.

458
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,760
What a shame she didn't realize
personality was the other 50.

459
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,320
[laughter]

460
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,400
- What about kind of,
you can always buy a new dress,

461
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,800
you can buy a new wig,
but God doesn't come down

462
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,320
and give you a second
personality.

463
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,000
- Polish its head, but roll it
in glitter.

464
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,160
It's that kind of--

465
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,680
- That--you've just found the
joke.

466
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,760
- Keep it coming.

467
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,240
Keep it coming, bitch.

468
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,160
- Start strong.

469
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,920
That'll put a fire in your
energy.

470
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,560
And then you're off.

471
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,080
- Aisling is filling me with
confi-donk.

472
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,720
- Own your whole persona.

473
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,040
Like, you do have this.

474
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,600
I would love to sit and get read
by you.

475
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,640
- No, you don't, honestly,
not with them boots.

476
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,000
[laughter]
- I'm joking.

477
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,040
- Yes!

478
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,520
- Joking.
- I just got read.

479
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,680
Thank you, Danny.

480
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,760
Yeah.

481
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,520
- I feel funny as fuck.

482
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,760
- Oh, my God. My boots got read.

483
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,840
I feel honored.

484
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,920
- Bring it on.

485
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,280
[energetic music]

486
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,480
How you feel?

487
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
- Feeling good.

488
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,200
- It's elimination day,
and we're back in the work room

489
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,360
getting ready for the roast,
a political themed roast.

490
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,800
Very camp.

491
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,040
- Girls, how amazing was
Aisling, no?

492
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,000
- Do you know what?

493
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,320
Filled me with some confidence.

494
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,720
I was a bit nervous going into
that.

495
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,000
- That's strange you said that.

496
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,480
I never would have thought
you would have been nervous

497
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
going into this challenge.

498
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,880
This is a challenge made for
you, love.

499
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,280
- I appreciate that I've got
some strengths over others

500
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,000
in this, but it's a vulnerable
position,
actually,

501
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,760
to stand in front of a whole
crowd
full of people

502
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,880
and your job is to entertain
them.

503
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,840
- Yeah.

504
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,000
- It's taken me a long time
to be comfortable on stage.

505
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,840
- I have gone through life
never really feeling

506
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,000
that level of assuredness.

507
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,520
The kind of drag I do now
is not very stage based.

508
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,280
I don't perform a huge amount.

509
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,040
- Hearing people like you
and Danny say that,

510
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,480
it's kind of like, how could you
ever

511
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,920
even feel that way
after you've been slaying

512
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,000
the game the whole time?

513
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,360
I guess there is a pressure.

514
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,200
- This is stuff that I'm not

515
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,720
massively familiar with, right?

516
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,400
Like, I love doing a little bit
of a chat.

517
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,240
- We know.

518
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,120
[laughter]

519
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,480
- She's giving another lecture.

520
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,840
- I think everybody thinks
I'm quite serious.

521
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,520
Sometimes in life, you need
serious.

522
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,080
You're saying whoever invented
democracy wasn't serious?

523
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,640
- You never stop learning in
drag.

524
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,800
It's a different crowd.

525
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,720
It's a different vibe every
single time.

526
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,760
- We go to work,
and we get to see people

527
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,360
having a good time.
- Yeah.

528
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,840
- But we are so lucky for that.

529
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,120
- That's why I do drag is
because

530
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,520
I love to make people laugh.

531
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,200
- Same.
- Let's see if I do today.

532

PEPPA: All these other girls
are comedians.

534
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,320
They have a very high bar.

535
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,760
But there's not really
any expectation of me

536
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,160
to be funny, so I can take this
whichever direction

537
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,800
I want to go.

538
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,000
PIXIE: I'm really excited at the
prospect

539
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,840
of roasting these girls.

540
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,680
It's time to smear the
competition.

541
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,680
- I have got my blinders on,

542
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,200
and I am ready to burn a bitch.

Welcome to the main stage
of "RuPaul's Drag Race UK."

550
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,440
The iron lady of drag, Michelle
Visage.

her.

Now, Alan, have you ever run for
office?

557

- Run for office in these heels?

558
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,600
No, child.

559
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,920

Hello. Hello. Hello.

- Ru, can I say I have waited
years and years to be here?

00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,400
And it's a sin how good you
look.

00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:39,200
I'm here today
to not only represent myself,

582

but also Liverpool.

00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,760
I know what you're all thinking.

584
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,080
Liverpool's rough.

585
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,360
And I want to clear something
up, girls.

586
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,240
It's been in the news recently.

587
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,360
A big, big house behind
the central library

588
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,040
has been zoned for drugs.

And I want to let you know I was
just

590
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,040
as shocked as the rest
of Liverpool to find out

591
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,720
we had a library.

Olly Alexander, everyone.

When you think of Olly,
you think it's a sin,

00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,040
not the TV show, the teeth.

You are proof
that you can't polish your shit,

and it is lovely.

- Black Peppa, everyone.

Do you know what I love about
you, babe?

614
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,560
You've really opened up on the
show
while you've been here.

615
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,120
And I want people that watch
this to know

616
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,480
you can't be held back by bad
teeth.

[laughter]

618

Honestly, when you smile next to
Olly,
next to Alan,

619
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,720
it's like looking through a
graveyard.

00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,280
- Oh, my God.

622
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,680
- Now, Jonbers Blonde,

623
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,760
I thought the troubles in
Ireland
ended in the '90s,

624
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,200
but it's clear from looking at
her face

625
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,000
that they have only just begun.

626

[laughter]

627
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,760
And now I want to move on now
to a Manchester sister.

628
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,600
No, not the Manchester
mannequin,

629
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,080
no badges panicking.

630
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,080
I'm talking about Dr. Cheddar
Bore-geous.

631
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,920
Babe, you are so boring,
you could make a deaf insomniac

632
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,560
go to sleep just by talking.

633
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,120
You really could.

634
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,080
And I found it hard to write
something

635
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,800
about Pixie, if I'm honest.

636
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,520
How am I gonna roast Pixie?

637
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,120
And then it dawned on me.

638
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,320
Roasting's what you do with a
pig.

639
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,320
[laughter]

640
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,720
Looking around this room,
all these ugly, crusty-ass
bitches

641
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,840
can't do a job as good as me.

642
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,760
And that is why I should take
this fucking crown.

643
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,800
Tonight, don't message me after
the show.

644
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,640
[cheers and applause]

645
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,040
Thank you. Good night.

646
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,520
Thanks.

647
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,720
[cheers and applause]

648
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,840
[dramatic music]

649
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,960
[cheers and applause]

650
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,240
- Yes!

651
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,680
- Sorry I'm late.

652
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,720
I've just been to Downing Street
for a wee pre-swall,

653
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,120
as we like to say in Belfast.

654
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,320
They don't call it Downing
Street
for nothing.

655
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,400
You know what I mean?

656
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,800
[laughter]

657
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,000
Oop.

658
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,560
Some people would say that's a
hard choice

659
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,480
going after Danny Beard.

660
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,600
But nothing in life should be
hard

661
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,800
except for dicks.

662
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,080
And Danny's a dick.

663
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,080
[laughter]

664
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,560
Now, I'm a bit drunk,
so that's why I've got some
notes.

665
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,960
Now, one thing that I want to
say

666
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,320
is that I am Irish.

667
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,080
I'm so Northern Irish

668
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,600
that my gender reveal was a bomb
scare.

669
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,480
[laughter]

670
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,160
Actually, this kind of reminds
me
of, like, being

671
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,280
at a job center, doesn't it?

672
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,200
Ru, you're like the manager
of the job center.

673
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,000
- What's a job center?

674
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,720
[laughter]

675
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,320
- It's somewhere where you go
when some people

676
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,360
don't have work like these
queens.

677
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,200
Now, I'm drunk.

678
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,720
[laughter]

679
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,680
- We can tell.

680
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,000
- I came to drag racing
to show versatility.

681
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,880
And I've played a sex worker,
pigeon.

682
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,760
I've played a bag of snakes.

683
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,840
I've played a dog
whose name I still don't
remember.

684
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,800
[laughter]

685
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,800
- Fugly.
- Fugly.

686
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,240
Thank you.

687
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,120
I'm ready for my next role.

688
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,440
I'll play--I don't know--

689
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,920
Peppa the Pig.

690
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,160
[laughter]

691
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,880
No. No. No.

692
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,440
Peppa, you are amazing.

693
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,040
People, they don't get thrown
out of a Peppa gig.

694
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,480
They get thrown in.

695
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,160
[laughter]

696
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,160
PEPPA: I didn't expect Jonbers
to be this good.

697
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,320
Where--where did this come from?

698
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,960
- Michelle, you are a patron
saint now
of Ireland.

699
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,240
That's why you gave your boobs
to Alan.

700
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,440
[laughter]

701
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,960
And lastly, but not least...

702
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,240
[laughter]

703
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,960
I'm here to tell you,

704
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,880
these kitty girls shit outside
the box.

705
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,080
Disgusting!

706
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,560
I am a pussy.

707
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,280
You can trust her.

708
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:55,120
Please choose me
after that terrible, terrible
set.

709
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,160
[cheers and applause]

710
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,040
You're all bastards.

711
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,160
[laughter]

712
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,320
[dramatic music]

713
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,000
- First off, I'd like to say
thank you to Ru for giving me

714
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,280
this opportunity to slaughter
the queens

715
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,600
and drag them through the mud
just like Pixie did to Wendy

716
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,960
in the makeover challenge.

717
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,280
[laughter]

718
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,920
[sighs]

719
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,760
Now, it took me a long time
to get to this point

720
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,400
in the competition.

721
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,600
And it's taken me even longer

722
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,080
because of the backed up traffic
on the M6

723
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,640
and the M25 and the trains.

724
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,840
Just laugh.

725
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,880
[laughter]

726
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,120
I'm not a comedian,
but I am stunning, and I'm
pretty.

727
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,720
Michelle Visage, my girl White
Saw...

728
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
- That's me.

729
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,160
- I'd like to thank you so much

730
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,920
for taking time out of your busy
schedule

731
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,400
to show up in drag.

732
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,920
- You're welcome.

733
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,680
[laughter]

734
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,800
- Now, I am very soft-spoken,
and it's something

735
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,880
I've always had my entire life.

736
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,480
I don't have to be obnoxious
like Danny Beard.

737
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,720
I don't have to put Marmite
on my skin as foundation.

738
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,120
- Thank you, honey.

739
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,520
I appreciate you trying.

740
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,640
- You're welcome.

741
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,960
[laughter]

742
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,200
I'm bombing hard. It's okay.

743
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,280
You can laugh.

744
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,040
[laughter]

745
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,680
Now, no one can look like me.

746
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,840
No one can speak like me.

747
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,440
And no one can speak like Just
May.

748
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,960
I mean, girl, the first time I
met you,

749
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,040
I was like, why is Trixie Mattel
spitting on me, girl?

750
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,520
[laughter]

751
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,840
Now, sticks and stones may break
my bones,

752
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,320
but Le Fil's props will never
hurt me.

753
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,480
You are truly the fellow queen
of the season.

754
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,720
- Ooh. Ooh.

755
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,320
- [sighs]

756
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,800
Dakota, Dakota, now, I love you
so much.

757
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,120
It was so hard to see you leave,

758
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,240
but it's good to see you
wearing makeup tonight.

759
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,960
Yay!

760
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,280
- Cheddar Gorgeous,
the prehistoric queen

761
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,680
of the season.

762
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,960
Cheddar Gorgeous is so old,
her first gig was when I was
born.

763
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,880
- Yes.

764
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,240
- Yeah.

765
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,280
[laughter]

766
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,240
CHEDDAR: It's correct.

767
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,760
That's a fact.

768
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,920
- That was the end of my
political roast.

769
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,240
Thank you so much.

770
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,520
[cheers and applause]

771
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,080
Thank you.

772
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,240
[dramatic music]

773
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,120
- Before I begin, I would like
to make

774
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,600
a small public service
announcement.

775
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,160
I would just like to remind you
that politicians are liars.

776
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,640
That being said, it's so lovely
to be here amongst this panel

777
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,720
of extremely talented queens.

778
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,680
[laughter]

779
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,520
Girls, it's so lovely to have
you back.

780
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,440
We've got Just Meh.

781
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,320
And Sminty Dropped Out of the
Race.

782
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,640
- Oh. Right.

783
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,280
- My pal, Copper Topps here.

784
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,360
Hello, Copper Topp.
- Hey. Hey, gorg.

785
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,920
- An ironic name, now, isn't it?

786
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,040
Yeah, given how many times
you're in the bottom.

787
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,960
You know, people often say,
Copper,

788
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,040
you smell like pennies,

789
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,800
not because you're usually
ginger,

790
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,600
just because that's what you get
paid in
at your gigs.

791
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,160
[laughter]

792
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,600
And I'm so--oh, no.

793
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,160
I've already done that one.
Sorry.

794
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,760
- I thought Pixie had this in
the bag.

795
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,680
I'm like Kris Jenner on the
sidelines.

796
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,840
I'm there going...

797
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,840
[laughing]

798
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,280
- Now, I love to visit famous
landmarks.

799
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,120
Actually, I've got a bit of
bucket list.

800
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,000
And staring up at Alan today,

801
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,240
I can finally say I've seen
Stonehenge.

802
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,800
Cheddar Gorgeous is named
after the famous Cheddar Gorge.

803
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,800
And scientists recently
discovered

804
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,960
a 9.000-year-old skeleton
at the bottom of Cheddar Gorge.

805
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,440
Can you believe it?

806
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,520
And it's so lovely to have you
here
with us today, Ru.

807
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,400
Thank you so much.

808
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,400
[laughter]

809
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,000
To the right,
dishonorable Michelle Visage.

810
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Hello, Michelle.

811
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
- Hiya.

812
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,160
- Yeah, she actually came up
in the world of ballroom,

813
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,400
something she wishes
more of her underwear had.

814
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,680
[laughter]

815
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,000
- Very true.

816
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
- Now, there are several
very important issues

817
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,600
I would like to discuss
in this campaign speech.

818
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:32,640
First up is education,
because RuPaul's School for
Girls

819
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,000
only has one pupil, Peppa.

820
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,840
But you know what?

821
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,240
All that focused learning,
and you still haven't learned

822
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,760
how not to be in the bottom.

823
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,880
[clears throat]

824
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,000
And moving swiftly on.

825
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,960
We'll move swiftly on.

826
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,520
That one didn't land, but this
one's nice.

827
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,880
Danny, I was worried when I
heard Danny

828
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,800
was going to be attending this
roast,
but then I remembered

829
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,840
how much I love bacon.

830
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,760
Who doesn't love a hog roast?

831
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,800
[clears throat]

832
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,520
Jonbers is such a drunk
that when she does a terrible
gig,

833
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,680
she gets excited by all the
booze.

834
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,280
And I'm gonna wrap this up now,

835
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,520
'cause apparently
I thought I was funnier than I
am.

836
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,120
[laughter]

837
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
Thank you all for listening.

838
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,120
I've been Pixie Polite.

839
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,400
Pick Pixie,
and make politics polite again.

840
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,720
Thank you very much.

841
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,720
[cheers and applause]

842
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,480
[dramatic music]

843
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,520
- Worthless humans of the planet
Earth--

844
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,920
[laughter]

845
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,760
I'm so sorry.

846
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,160
That appears to be the wrong
speech.

847
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,120
[laughter]

848
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,320
People of the world, regular
people,

849
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:48,840
everyday people, mundane people,

850
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,120
I know what you're thinking.

851
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,800
A drag queen talking about
politics?

852
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,560
That's the last thing
that this country needs.

853
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,960
I know you have worries.

854
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,920
There are terrible rumors
about myself and people like me.

855
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,160
But we are not all gobby
attention-seeking

856
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,880
sex-obsessed dick pigs
with regional accents.

857
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,840
Yes, I am talking about you,
Danny Beard.

858
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,680
[laughter]

859
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,480
But no, I intend to use the
power of drag

860
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,680
to amplify important issues
like educating the children,

861
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,880
like regulating free markets,

862
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,960
and of course,
the issue on everybody's lips,
rimming,

863
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,720
because that is what really
matters,
isn't it, my dears?

864
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,800
Oh.

865
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,200
- What is happening right now?

866
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,160
This is a roast.

867
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,640
I feel like I'm in a lecture
right now.

868
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:55,240
- And here, we have
the wonderful bare backbenchers.

869
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,240
That was a politics joke.

870
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
If any of you followed it,

871
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,000
it would have been absolutely
hilarious.

872
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,320
[laughter]

873
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,880
I can't help what I'm working
with.

874
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,480
- Sminty, you are looking
gorgeous tonight.

875
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,520
- Thank you.

876
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,640
- Almost as good
as you look on Instagram.

877
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,080
[laughter]

878
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,920
- You bitch.

879
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:19,240
- Oh, Starlet, still young,
still beautiful, I see.

880
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
Don't worry.

881
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,240
You'll grow out of both, I
assure you.

882
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,960
And of course, icon, RuPaul,
I have certainly learned so much

883
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,360
about myself, about
improvisation,

884
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,880
about the powerful combination
of lighting

885
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,200
and sitting very, very, very
still.

886
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,760
[laughter]

887
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,800
A vote for Cheddar is a vote for
change.

888
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,720
And I want to promise you
right here and now that neither
I,

889
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,600
nor any of my kind
will eat your children...alive.

890
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,320
Thank you very, very much.

891
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,120
[cheers and applause]

892
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,280
- And she wanted to go first
with that routine?

893
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,640
Sorry.

894
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,640
[upbeat music]

895
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,200
RUPAUL: [singing] Can you feel
the love?

896
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,840
Category is Pretty in Punk.

897
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,880
Up first, oh, Danny Beard.

898
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,920
God shave the queen.
- [laughs]

899
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:24,280
DANNY: I am wearing head-to-toe
iconic not Danny Beard

900
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,880
because it's punking it.

901
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,080
They can touch my sex pistol.

902
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,800
- Never mind the bollocks, baby.

903
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,280
DANNY: I want to put a message
on the back of this,

904
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,600
which is fuck gender and fuck
what the heteronormative world

905
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,240
says we should be.

906
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,200
And that is punk.

907
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,280
- Ladies and gentlemen, Dolly
Tartan.

908
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,000
[laughter]

909
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,920
Up next, Jonbers Blonde.

910
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,240
- Ooh.

911
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,160
- Safety first.

912
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,600
JONBERS: Punk to me is anarchic.

913
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,920
It is a spirit who is just
completely free

914
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,760
and being themselves.

915
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,600
- I just wanted my ears pierced.

916
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,000
ALAN: Just pierce off.

917
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,200
JONBERS: My look is inspired
by Siouxsie and the Banshees,

918
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,080
a bit McQueen and a bit
showgirl.

919
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,720
You ever seen a safety pin
this big before, big boy?

920
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,160
- Bye, Piers Morgan.

921
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,560
[laughter]

922
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,840
Up next, Black Peppa.

923
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,080
- Ooh! Ooh!

924
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,440
MICHELLE: What we are witnessing
here is the last

925
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,720
of the freaking Mohicans.

926
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,960
PEPPA: I am wearing over 5.000
studs.

927
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,040
This outfit is heavier than
life.

928
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,160
It's heavier than me.

929
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,880
- I think I've got punk in my
eye.

930
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,120
[laughter]

931
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,320
MICHELLE: Alan!

932
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,400
PEPPA: I am serving an iconic
silhouette.

933
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,280
I am a living work of art.

934
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,000
This is punk on acid.

935
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,040
MICHELLE: The good thing about
those shoulder pads

936
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,760
is they don't need water.

937
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,040
RUPAUL: Pixie Polite.

938
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,840
ALAN: "Rule, Clitannia!"

939
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,600
PIXIE: My look is a Westward
inspired

940
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,960
"God save the queen" moment.

941
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,960
- Oh, look, Ru. She's crowning.

942
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,920
OLLY: Oh. Oh.

943
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,840
ALAN: Oh.

944
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,840
MICHELLE: Oh, dear.

945
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,160
- The crown jewels.

946
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,720
PIXIE: I'm covered in Union Jack
colors.

947
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,280
And I'm feeling like
I've got a bit of attitude

948
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,760
on the runway,
but also pretty darn fabulous.

949
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,920
- Her limbs are made of
Westwood.

950
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,400
RUPAUL: Up next, Cheddar
Gorgeous.

951
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,920
- They call her Sputnik.

952
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,840
- I see her velvet undergrounds.

953
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,680
- Punk, what an amazing theme.

954
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,360
ALAN: Is that Sid Malicious?

955
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,400
MICHELLE: I think it's Sid
Delicious.

956
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,040
- I predict her Johnny's rotten.

957
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,960
CHEDDAR: I am wearing
a vintage leather dress.

958
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:55,800
I have gigantic green spikes
coming out of my head.

959
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,200
I feel so punk,
I could bite a hamster's head
off

960
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,440
if that wasn't a hideously cruel
thing
to do.

961
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,640
- This look is buzzcocked and
loaded.

962
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,040
RUPAUL: [singing] Can you feel
the love?

963
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,440
Welcome, ladies.

964
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,080
It's time for the judges'
critiques.

965
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,840
Let's start with Danny Beard.

966
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,440
- In the roast challenge,
you opened it up,

967
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,200
which is never an easy thing to
do.

968
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,120
But you went out there with
confidence.

969
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,480
You knew what you came to do,
and you did it.

970
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,920
It was funny, and that's what a
roast is.

971
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,160
And I thought you delivered it
really well.

972
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,760
- I mean, I would pay to see
that
at a comedy club.

973
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,640
I don't think I could follow
you.

974
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,040
You were just so on fire.

975
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,760
- Fashion is to Ru
what sex is to Alan: paid for.

976
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,240
- You just were so witty.

977
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,440
You took everyone down.

978
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,840
It was like a disaster movie.

979
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,200
No one got out alive.

980
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,040
- This runway almost
brought me to tears.

981
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,560
I am thrilled with everything
that I see here.

982
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,320
And Danny, this is like
a Westwood wet dream.

983
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,200
And that's what I love about it.

984
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,120
- I love this look tonight so
much.

985
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,520
I love the message on the back,
fuck gender.

986
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,400
You just smashed it.

987
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,240
Well done.

988
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,720
- You know how to do it.

989
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,200
These jokes and the delivery was
something

990
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,560
that you had honed working in
clubs.

991
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,640
You're a hard one to beat.

992
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,880
Strong night for you, Danny.

993
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,800
Thank you so much.

994
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,440
- Thank you.

995
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,560
- All right. Up next, Jonbers
Blonde.

996
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,480
- You have that great character
of being a drunk politician.

997
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,400
And I love the fact that,
you know, if a joke didn't land,

998
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,000
you just said, I'm pissed.

999
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,080
It's just brilliant.

1000
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,040
- You made such a bold choice,
and I love that.

1001
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,040
And also,
you seemed like you had a lot of
fun.

1002
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,120
That makes me have fun, so I
love that.

1003
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,520
- I'm ready for my next role.

1004
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,000
I'll play--I don't know, Peppa
the Pig.

1005
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,160
- I would come and see your
show.

1006
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,440
- Buy a ticket.

1007
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,240
- I'll buy a ticket.

1008
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,880
- This outfit is beautiful.

1009
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,760
The only thing I would have
changed
is the hair.

1010
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,120
Your head looks so teeny tiny in
it.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1011
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,880
- But I love the concept of it.

1012
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,800
And I could tell
how confident you felt in it,

1013
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,240
and I enjoyed that.

1014
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,040
- I love this dress so much.

1015
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,880
And the big shocker of the night

1016
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,280
was that you didn't suck.

1017
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,280
[laughter]

1018
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,360
Shocker.

1019
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,240
Did you have fun?

1020
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,760
- I actually did have fun.

1021
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,600
I just thought,
what's gonna get me through
this?

1022
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
Be drunk.

1023
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,600
- Yeah.

1024
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,960
So you and Peppa assigned the
order.

1025
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,280
Why did you go second?

1026
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,800
- I knew that I wasn't gonna be
one of the funniest,

1027
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,600
so I wanted to go somewhere in
the middle,

1028
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,120
and I wanted to go second.

1029
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,520
- All right.

1030
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,200
Well, thank you.

1031
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,560
Up next, Black Peppa.

1032
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,720
- Hi, Black Peppa.

1033
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,760
- Hi.

1034
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,920
- You have this very positive,
kind energy.

1035
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,000
We were really on your side,
so I could feel that you were

1036
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
a bit nervous in the roast.

1037
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,200
But we just wanted you
to have fun with it.

1038
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,440
- Everyone had such good will
for you.

1039
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,360
And one of your biggest laughs
was when you just said,

1040
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,640
"Oh, just laugh."

1041
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,720
- I'm bombing hard. It's okay.

1042
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,760
You can laugh.

1043
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,880
[laughter]

1044
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,200
- And we all laughed
because we all want you to do
well.

1045
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,160
- I know how nervous you were

1046
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,280
because you've got it in your
head
that you're not funny.

1047
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,040
It's one of those personal
roadblocks

1048
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,080
that you're going to have to
overcome
at some point.

1049
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,040
But what I do want to give you
credit on

1050
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,040
is that you kept on going.

1051
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,160
This look tonight, wowza, wowza,
wowza.

1052
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,120
Your silhouette, stunning.

1053
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,120
Your hair, stunning.

1054
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,280
Your shoulders, stunning.

1055
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,520
Like, all of it is just amazing.

1056
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,400
We've just got to get your
confidence up.

1057
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,480
You've got it.

1058
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,680
You just gotta know you've got
it.

1059
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,360
- You need to free yourself.

1060
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,640
There's only one person
keeping it in place.

1061
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,440
Can you guess who that person
is?

1062
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,640
- I wonder who that can be.

1063
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,640
RUPAUL: Yes. Yes.

1064
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,720
- It's taken me such a while for
me

1065
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,440
to grow into my queerness.

1066
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,160
I'm now 29 years old.

1067
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,520
And every single day,
I'm still figuring out who I am.

1068
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:52,640
- The key here is the child
who lives inside of you.

1069
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,000
Your child is waiting for you,
adult you,

1070
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,400
to give permission to do it
starting now.

1071
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,480
All right.

1072
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,400
Up next, Pixie Polite.

1073
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,080
- Hey, Pixie.
- Hi.

1074
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,240
- A roast is a comedy challenge,

1075
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,200
but you need to go hard.

1076
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,360
There were things that were
missed.

1077
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,920
What was the Stonehenge joke?

1078
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,440
- I can finally tick Stonehenge
off my bucket list

1079
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,760
after seeing Alan's teeth.

1080
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,880
- But you didn't say
they were Alan's teeth.

1081
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,720
- Oh, did I not?

1082
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,040
Staring up at Alan today, I can
finally
say

1083
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,800
I've seen Stonehenge.

1084
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,480
- Because of that,
the room was kind of flat.

1085
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,760
- I think because you spoke
quite fast,

1086
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,360
I didn't understand some of the
jokes.

1087
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,240
I'm still trying to figure out
what the one was before.

1088
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,960
- Tonight on the runway,
the idea of this is wonderful.

1089
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,520
I think the issue for me
is we lose Pixie in this.

1090
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,480
It's very quilty.

1091
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,960
- Okay. Thank you.

1092
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,880
- I love the--the twist on
"Rule, Britannia,"

1093
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,600
this tornado of color,

1094
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,440
but I preferred the runway to
your roast.

1095
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,960
Your roast was a bit lukewarm.

1096
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,560
Don't ever snag my
fucking teeth off again.

1097
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,120
[laughter]

1098
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,080
- You know, Pixie,
when the roast challenge came
up,

1099
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,400
I thought, okay, now,
this is gonna be an opportunity

1100
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,680
for her to really let loose.

1101
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,440
You are naturally funny.

1102
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,360
And I didn't get any of that.

1103
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,600
- When the first few jokes,
perhaps, didn't do as well,

1104
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,960
I think part of me shrank back
a little bit.

1105
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,080
- I don't know.

1106
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,560
I felt like you were not being
you,

1107
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,400
your own natural funniness.

1108
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,280
- Yeah.

1109
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,680
- All right, Pixie.

1110
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,640
Up next, Cheddar Gorgeous.

1111
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,920
- You know, you're so strong
in this competition.

1112
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,200
Everybody kind of has eyes on
you.

1113
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,800
And tonight was the first
little chink in the armor

1114
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,840
that I saw from this, Cheddar.

1115
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,360
I loved the characterization
that you did,

1116
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,000
but it almost became a play.

1117
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,960
- I know what you're thinking.

1118
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,880
A drag queen talking about
politics?

1119
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,840
That's the last thing
that this country needs.

1120
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,600
- I think it was almost too
smart
for the room.

1121
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,240
- If you were at the National
Theater,

1122
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,000
I think you'd probably get
a standing ovation.

1123
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,280
But if you're in a comedy club,

1124
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,640
you'd probably get a slow hand
clap.

1125
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,360
- This runway look has got me
very hot
under the color.

1126
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,080
This was like everything I dated

1127
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,880
when I was 14, 15 years old.

1128
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,800
That does it for me.

1129
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,440
- And this look is beautiful.

1130
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,200
And the future is definitely
queer.

1131
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,040
And I love all the details on
the face.

1132
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,840
Really impressive.

1133
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,840
So thank you.

1134
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,960
- Your tone was more
of an intellectual take,

1135
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,240
so we had to actually listen up,

1136
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:22,720
which is kind of difficult
for a drunken crowd like we are.

1137
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,240
- I enjoy being funny in
conversation.

1138
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,040
I'm not really that into being
funny
on stage.

1139
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,480
For me, humor comes
from the world that I'm in.

1140
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,040
And I like to pick up on things
as they happen.

1141
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,720
And I also know I'm very dry.

1142
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,200
And I think,
regardless of what kind of humor
I'll do,

1143
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,920
I'll always be very dry.

1144
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,720
And that's just who I am.

1145
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,920
- And you were asked to perform
last.

1146
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,160
How do you feel about that?

1147
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,400
- I mean,
I didn't want to perform last.

1148
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,040
But that was the position I was
given,

1149
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,440
so I just had to go with it.

1150
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,600
- Well, thank you.

1151
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,000
All right. Thank you, ladies.

1152
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,840
I think we've heard enough.

1153
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,320
While you untuck in the
workroom,

1154
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,560
the judges and I will
deliberate.

1155
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,680
You may leave the stage.

1156
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,120
[energetic music]

1157
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,560
- We're back and untucked.

1158
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,520
And Danny got very strong
critiques,

1159
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,600
but I think there's
a glimmer of hope for me here.

1160
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,720
Oh, shit.

1161
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,960
Oh, shit.

1162
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,720
I can see a light
at the end of the tunnel.

1163
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,000
- Here we are again.

1164
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,080
How we doing, eh?

1165
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,000
- I was not expecting good
things
like that.

1166
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,640
- She was just a pissed-up old
fart,

1167
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,600
and they like seeing that.

1168
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,720
- [laughs]
- What's new?

1169
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,240
- The critique of the evening
that Ru said,

1170
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,520
that I didn't suck.

1171
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,720
- Well, she's not met you
on a Saturday night then.

1172
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,720
- $20.

1173
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,920
I was just trying to do my best.

1174
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,840
And I was hoping for these
critiques.

1175
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,440
So to get them is--

1176
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,880
it's just amazing.

1177
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,480
- I thought the judges who
critiqued me

1178
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,680
were really, really fair.

1179
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,360
I think--you know, I knew going
into it

1180
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,080
that I would be really, really
dry.

1181
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:51,920
How was I supposed to know
that my audience would be so
lazy

1182
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,560
and that I would be so shit?

1183
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,840
[laughs]

1184
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,560
It was frustrating to me

1185
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,720
a little bit that I was the only
person

1186
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,160
who told you where I--

1187
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:06,680
I think I should go,
and you didn't trust that.

1188
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,440
- Like, you said that you
wouldn't have put you last--

1189
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,440
- I wouldn't.

1190
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,480
- Like, we put you there
because we believed in you.

1191
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,400
- But I did tell you I am quite
dry,

1192
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,840
quite sarcastic, quite ironic,

1193
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,600
and quite slow paced and
intellectual.

1194
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,760
It's just who I am.

1195
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,160
- Yeah.

1196
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,440
- I should not have been at the
end.

1197
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,200
I can't hold that against
Jonbers,

1198
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,040
and I don't hold that against
Jonbers.

1199
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,280
But I was right.

1200
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,640
What about you guys?

1201
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,680
- I mean, the critique wasn't
necessarily

1202
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,760
something I wasn't expecting.

1203
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,440
And I just, you know,
feel a bit disappointed in
myself

1204
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,280
that I couldn't have done
better.

1205
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,120
- I'll be honest, right, mate.

1206
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,080
For some reason, your timing was
off.

1207
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,840
I think if you'd have got
a good couple of laps

1208
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,400
in that first 30 seconds,
minute,

1209
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,560
you'd have smashed tonight.

1210
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,400
- Yeah.

1211
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,840
I've had a lovely time in
office,

1212
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,480
but I'm going back through that
pink door

1213
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,320
into comedy retirement.

1214
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,040
- Peppa, how you feeling, angel?

1215
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,840
- I don't know.

1216
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,600
I'm, like, lost for words
because I feel

1217
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,480
like I can definitely do better,

1218
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,680
but I'm just not in my comfort
space.

1219
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,720
It's like the third week,
and it's comedy, comedy, comedy.

1220
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,080
- But you're still here, yeah?
- Yeah.

1221
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,040
DANNY: So that says a lot.

1222
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,440
PEPPA: I bombed at the roast.

1223
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,760
However,
someone else is in the bottom
with me.

1224
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,720
I hope the bus is still running
because another girl

1225
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,000
is about to start packing.

1226
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,040
- It was lovely to see
the eliminated queens.

1227
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,800
Do you think we went
too hard on them though?

1228
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,680
- No.

1229
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,240
- I barely touched them.

1230
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,200
I didn't touch them.

1231
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,240
I didn't burn them.

1232
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,160
[laughter]

1233
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,800
- [screams]

1234
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,880
[all screaming]

1235
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,320
- Did you miss us?

1236
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,200
- It's like a Christmas carol.

1237
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,560
We've got the ghosts
of challenges past back.

1238
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,840
It's lovely to see everyone.

1239
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,040
You know, the band's
all back together again.

1240
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,680
- You all look absolutely
stunning.

1241
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,840
[overlapping chatter]

1242
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,600
- Look at this sexy mermaid.

1243
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,960
- Made this out of the gold
fabric
she got in the box.

1244
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,840
[overlapping chatter]

1245
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,280
- Too little, too late.

1246
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,840
- So, girls,
what did you think of the roast?

1247
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,280
- It was hilarious.

1248
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,720
- Danny, you killed it.

1249
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,160
DANNY: I set the tone.

1250
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,600
I set the pace.

1251
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,320
I set the fucking place on fire.

1252
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,040
[laughs]

1253
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,240
- Was anyone annoyed
by any of the reads?

1254
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,840
- Were you annoyed by the read?

1255
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,880
- I wanted more attack.

1256
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,240
- Give us more in the
competition,

1257
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,520
and we'd have more to say.

1258
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,720
- Well, you can have another
chance.

1259
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,720
- I love your outfit.

1260
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,920
[laughter]

1261
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,040
[overlapping chatter]

1262
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,080
- Is this the top five you
expected?

1263
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,600
- I'm not, like, surprised by
anybody.

1264
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,720
- I thought I was gonna snatch
this crown.

1265
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,320
And here we are, ninth place,
you know?

1266
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,240
[laughter]

1267
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,280
- RuPaul laughed the hardest
at your exit.

1268
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,440
[laughter]

1269
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,400
- Dressed as a moth?

1270
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,360
Like, what the fuck
was going on in episode four?

1271
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,400
- Every single girl, no matter
where

1272
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,600
you leave in this competition,
wants to be in this final.

1273
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,080
- I'm really happy to
be back with everybody.

1274
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,440
I missed you all.

1275
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,440
- We missed you too!

1276
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,760
JONBERS: I know that this is the
week
before the final.

1277
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,400
I want it so much more.

1278
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,400
- To season four, everyone.

1279
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,640
[cheers and applause]

1280
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,640
- All right.

1281
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,840
Now, just between us squirrel
friends, what do you think?

1282
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,960
Starting with Danny Beard.

1283
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,840
- You know, in the roast,
we hope that Danny Beard would

1284
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,080
come out and shut it down.

1285
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,840
And shut it down, Danny Beard
did.

1286
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,760
- They came out,
and they were in charge.

1287
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,760
Really funny.

1288
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,960
Just polished.

1289
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,600
- You are proof
that you can't polish your shit,

1290
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,240
but you can roll it in
rhinestones.

1291
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,080
- You could put him on
at the Comedy Store.

1292
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,640
He was that good.

1293
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,520
- And that runway look was
iconic.

1294
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,160
RUPAUL: Gorgeous.

1295
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,360
Clearly, Danny is a pro.

1296
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,360
- Everything Danny Beard did
tonight
was a home run.

1297
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,200
And that, my friend,
is a sports reference.

1298
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,920
[laughter]

1299
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,240
You're welcome.
RUPAUL: All right.

1300
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,040
Let's move on down to Jonbers
Blond.

1301
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,640
- You know, with Jonbers,
I was really proud of her

1302
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:04,360
because she chose an objective,
a drunk.

1303
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,680
And it actually worked.

1304
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,480
- They don't call it Downing
Street
for nothing.

1305
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,680
You know what I mean?

1306
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,040
ALAN: It was inspired.

1307
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:11,880
It was clever.

1308
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,920
I saw a different side to her.

1309
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,760
- I loved her runway look.

1310
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,760
I thought it was very cute.

1311
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,760
ALAN: I loved it.

1312
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,960
And I loved the fiery
red around her crotch

1313
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,680
and everything.
- Of course, you did.

1314
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,080
- Of course I did.

1315
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,560
- I loved that outfit.

1316
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,640
It looked so gorgeous.

1317
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,600
Very, very proud of our Jonbers.

1318
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,840
All right.

1319
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,400
Let's move on down to Black
Peppa.

1320
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,360
- She wasn't the strongest
roaster,

1321
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,360
but I was instantly on her side.

1322
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,640
- She looked incredible.

1323
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,960
that kind of new glare inspired
outfit.

1324
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,600
And then she started telling
jokes.

1325
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,880
[laughter]

1326
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,400
- Cheddar Gorgeous is so old,

1327
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,200
her first gig was when I was
born.

1328
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,560
- Yes.

1329
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,160
- Yeah.

1330
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,880
MICHELLE:
What I do want to give her
credit for,

1331
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,640
though, is not giving up.

1332
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,840
- As always, she brings it to
the runway.

1333
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,960
- Whoa.

1334
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:02,240
Powerful, sexy, punk, drag,
spectacular.

1335
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,040
- She keeps saying,
I'm not funny, I'm not funny,

1336
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,600
but she clearly has a sense of
humor
in her fashion.

1337
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,120
Let's move on down to Pixie
Polite.

1338
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,920
- She's got funny bones,
yet she was not funny.

1339
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,680
- All that focused learning
and you still haven't learned

1340
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,440
how not to be in the bottom.

1341
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,000
- It was so lethargic.

1342
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,720
Then she starts slagging
off the gaps in my teeth.

1343
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,280
And I mean, at the end of the
bloody set,

1344
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,480
there was tumbleweed stuck
between them.

1345
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,480
[laughter]

1346
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,400
- Stuck between your teeth?

1347
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,080
- Yeah.

1348
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,600
- I thought on the runway, I
liked it.

1349
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,600
I appreciated it.

1350
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,560
But it was a little different
from the other queens.

1351
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,280
- The idea was wonderful,
but the shape of it was wrong.

1352
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,840
The fit of it was wrong.

1353
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:45,080
- Burt she hasn't figured out
yet
what is her point of view

1354
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,760
when it comes to drag.

1355
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,240
All right, Cheddar Gorgeous.

1356
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,280
- Cheddar tonight in the
challenge

1357
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,480
was more regional Reginal Art
Center
than comedy club.

1358
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,400
- We knew it was going
to be kind of serious.

1359
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,960
And then the minute she dropped
that act

1360
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,600
and started reading the
returnees,

1361
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,960
it was like, "Ah!"

1362
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,200
We got some really funny laughs.

1363
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,360
- You are looking gorgeous
tonight.

1364
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,400
- Thank you.

1365
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,520
- Almost as good
as you look on Instagram.

1366
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,800
[laughter]

1367
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,840
- I felt like she killed it
on the runway, for sure.

1368
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,200
MICHELLE: That look was amazing.

1369
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,840
I just thought
that was spot on and dynamic.

1370
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,600
- When Cheddar walked
out on the runway

1371
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,000
in that leather outfit,
I could smell the poppers.

1372
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,880
[laughter]

1373
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,680
Her comedy roast, we wanted a
little bit

1374
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,360
more yuck-yuck and a little less

1375
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,480
intellectual introspection.

1376
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,520
- Cheddar's smart.

1377
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,200
And that--for the first time
in this competition, I think,

1378
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,440
has come back to bite her.

1379
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,080
- Silence.

1380
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,200
I've made my decision.

1381
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,680
Bring back my girls.

1382
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,280
Welcome back, ladies.

1383
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,440
I've made some decisions.

1384
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,280
Danny Beard, at the general
erection,

1385
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,800
you were hard to beat.

1386
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,640
Condragulations.

1387
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,280
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

1388
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,840
[cheers and applause]
- Yay. Well done.

1389
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:05,920
- And the recipient
of a coveted RuPeter badge.

1390
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,760
[singing] RuPeter, yeah

1391
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,960
- Wear it with pride.
- I will.

1392
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,120
Thank you so much.

1393
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:17,640
- And most importantly,
you've earned your place

1394
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:22,800
in next week's grand finale.

1395
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:29,040
You may step to the back of the
stage.

1396
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,800
DANNY: Smash it, girls.

1397
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,440
Yes, bitches.

1398
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,440
Four badges in the final.

1399
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,920
Pow. Pow.

1400
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,480
Pow. Pow. I'm trying to be cool.

1401
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,800
It's not working, but I'm happy.

1402
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,600
- Black Peppa, on the runway,

1403
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,960
you were a total stud,

1404
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,960
but in the challenge, kind of a
dud.

1405
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,640
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1406
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,760
Jonbers Blond, you're safe,

1407
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,600
and you've earned your place
in next week's grand finale.

1408
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,120
- Thank you so much.

1409
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,840
- You may step to the back of
the stage.

1410
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,880
- Thank you.

1411
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,840
- Well done, girly.

1412
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,400
- Pixie Polite, you're a funny
queen,

1413
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:25,800
but your roast was undercooked.

1414
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,440
Cheddar Gorgeous, you're a
clever queen,

1415
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,560
but your roast was overcooked.

1416
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,480
Pixie Polite, I'm sorry, my
dear,

1417
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,960
but you are up for elimination.

1418
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,120
Cheddar Gorgeous, you are safe,

1419
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:52,160
and you've earned your place
in next week's grand finale.

1420
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,640
You may join the other girls.

1421
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,960
- Thank you so much.

1422
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,080
Thank you.

1423
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,600
- I'm up against Peppa in the
lip sync.

1424
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,160
I've seen what she can do.

1425
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,720
I'm going to put on a show the
best I can.

1426
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,840
- Two queens stand before me.

1427
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,600
I've consulted with the judges,

1428
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,720
but the final decision is mine
to make.

1429
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,960
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1430
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,960
and save yourself from
elimination.

1431
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,520
The time has come

1432
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:36,200
for you to lip sync

1433
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,760
for your life.

1434
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,000
[dramatic music]

1435
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,880
- I am making it to that final.

1436
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,000
Get ready.

1437
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,200
This is gonna be a fight.

1438
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,800
- Good luck,

1439
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,000
and don't

1440
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,760
fuck it up.

1441
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,280
[Queen's "Another One Bites the
Dust"]

1442
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,000
- [singing] Let's go.

1443
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,880
Steve walks warily down the
street

1444
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,560
With his brim pulled way down
low

1445
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,440
Ain't no sound but the sound of
his feet

1446
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,200
Machine guns ready to go

1447
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,160
Are you ready

1448
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,720
Hey, are you ready for this

1449
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,280
Are you hanging on the edge of
your seat

1450
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,600
Out of the doorway, the bullets
rip
to the sound of the beat

1451
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,800
Yeah

1452
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,200
Another one bites the dust

1453
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,080
And another one gone, and
another one gone

1454
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,280
Another one bites the dust

1455
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,440
Hey, I'm gonna get you too

1456
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,240
Another one bites the dust

1457
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,320
- Come on, Peppa!

1458
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,760
Come on, Pixie!

1459
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,760
Come on, girls!

1460
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,000
- [singing]
How do you think I'm gonna get
along

1461
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,920
Without you when you're gone

1462
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,360
You took me for everything that
I had

1463
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,320
And kicked me out on my own

1464
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,480
Are you happy

1465
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,680
Are you satisfied

1466
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,040
How long can you stand the heat

1467
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,640
Out of the doorway, the bullets
rip
to the sound of the beat

1468
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,600
Look out

1469
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,440
Another one bites the dust

1470
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,880
And another one gone, and
another one gone

1471
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,240
Another one bites the dust

1472
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,280
Hey, I'm gonna get you too

1473
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,400
Another one bites the dust

1474
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,720
Ooh, shout out

1475
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,800
There are plenty of ways
that you can hurt a man

1476
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,800
And bring him to the ground

1477
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,280
You can beat him, you can cheat
him

1478
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,320
You can treat him bad
and leave him when he's down

1479
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,400
But I'm ready

1480
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,600
It's ready for you

1481
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,400
I'm standing on my own two feet

1482
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,120
Out of the doorway, the bullets
rip

1483
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,400
Repeating to the sound of the
beat

1484
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,360
Oh, yeah

1485
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,520
Another one bites the dust

1486
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,000
And another one gone, and
another one gone

1487
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,280
Another one bites the dust

1488
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,120
Yeah

1489
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,520
Hey, I'm gonna get you too

1490
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,080
Another one bites the dust

1491
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,160
[laughter]

1492
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,160
[cheers and applause]

1493
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,240
- Ladies, I've made my decision.

1494
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,800
Black Peppa,

1495
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,800
shantay, you stay.

1496
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:12,080
You've earned your way
to next week's grand finale.

1497
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,000
You may join the other girls.

1498
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,320
- Thank you.

1499
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:28,280
- Pixie Polite,
thank you for spreading your
pixie dust

1500
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,240
all over this competition.

1501
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,560
Now sashay away.

1502
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,960
- I'd just like to say,
thank you all so much.

1503
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,840
This experience has been more

1504
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:41,400
than I ever dreamed it could be.

1505
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,200
I love you all so much.

1506
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,600
Goodbye.

1507
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,520
[applause]

1508
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,680
- Love you, Pixie.

1509
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,480
PIXIE: My girls.

1510
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,480
Well done.

1511
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,800
You guys are such a deserving
top four.

1512
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,680
I love you.

1513
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,720
All right.

1514
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,720
If you ever need me,

1515
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,840
just follow the second star on
the right

1516
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,080
and straight on until morning.

1517
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,760
Love you all.

1518
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,120
- Love you, baby.

1519
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,120
- Oh, how silly.

1520
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:19,000
I am so happy to have made it
this far in the competition.

1521
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,280
I couldn't have asked for more
before I came here.

1522
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,320
I'm gutted not to have made it
right to the end,

1523
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,800
that very last moment,
but they were all fabulous.

1524
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,040
I just wasn't the judges'
cup of tea today.

1525
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,280
That's all.

1526
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,120
There's been a lot of positives

1527
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,680
that I can take out of this
experience.

1528
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,080
And I think in the future,

1529
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,360
I'm gonna be a very different
Pixie.

1530
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,640
And I'm happy about that.

1531
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,160
- Condragulations to my top four
queens.

1532
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,680
Please step forward.

1533
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,680
[applause]

1534
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,400
- Yes!

1535
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,600
We did it.

1536
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,200
Yeah.
- Yes!

1537
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,960
- Now, I want to hear
from you, the fans.

1538
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,960
Who do you think deserves

1539
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,120
to be the UK's next Drag Race
superstar?

1540
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:17,160
Are you team Black Peppa?

1541
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,920
Are you team Cheddar Gorgeous?

1542
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,160
Are you team Danny Beard?

1543
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:27,320
Or are you team Jonbers Blonde?

1544
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,800
Let your voice be heard,

1545
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,960
and tune in next week for the
grand finale

01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,240
of "RuPaul's Drag Race UK,"

1547
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:38,320
where we will crown ourselves
a winner, baby.

1548
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,680
[laughs]

1549
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,400
Until then, remember,

1550
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,680
if you can't love yourself,

1551
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,840
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1552
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,680
Can I get an amen up in here?

1553
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:47,840
ALL: Amen.

1554
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:48,960
RUPAUL: All right.

1555
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,720
Now, let the music play.

01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,200
- [singing] To, to, to, to the
moon

1557
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,920
To the moon, baby

1558
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,000
To the moon

1559
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,360
Come on and take me away

1560
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:01,240
To, to, to, to the moon

1561
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,280
RUPAUL: Next time on
"RuPaul's Drag Race UK"...

1562
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,880
You'll take turns stealing the
spotlight

1563
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:13,040
as you perform a mega mix
of Drag Race anthems.

- It's only the winners
of "RuPaul's Drag Race UK."

1569
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:27,440
- What I didn't expect
were the looks and the beauty.

1570
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,200
- There's nothing
you can't overcome

1571
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,800
because look where you are.

1572
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,680
- This look just sums you up--

Love it.
